VOLUME LXXX.-NO. 148.
ALL AWAIT NOVEMBER THIRD,
Conditions of the Election
That Are New.
Owing to the Complicated Ballot
Systems the Result May
Be Delayed.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Oct. 25.â The
Presidential election of Tuesday, Novem
ber 3 next, will be held under conditions
which have never before prevailed and
which will render the official count r. â 
matter of difficulty and unusual delay.
Since the last Presidential contest almost
every State which had not then adopted
the Australian ballot system has by State
enactment prescribed some form of secret
blanket ballot, either based on the Aus
tralian plan or closely resembling it. The
only exceptions are Georgia, Louisiana,
North Carolina and South Carolina. In
the first three States named the old open
ballot system prevails and the election
machinery is in the hands of the State
authorities.
In South Carolina there is what is called
a ''reform ballot," the avowed purpose of
which is to restrict the votes of illnerate
negroes. In nearly all the other States
blanket ballots will be cast, and in many
of them the count will be complicated by
the fact that State, legislative and county
nominations are all printed on the same
ballot with the names of Presidential
electors. Connecticut has an envelope
sj-stem and New Jersey prints each party
ticket upon a separate ballot.
Should the election be in any way close,
it is therefore quite possible that it may
be twenty-four hours or evÂ£n forty-eight
hours after the polls are closed before the
results are known with absolute certainty.
In States like Nebraska, for instance,
where, according to conservative opinion,
there may not be a margin of 5000 votes
each way, it will be inpossible to arrive at
correct judgment until all the back coun
ties are beard from.
The polls in tha cities of some States
close at 4. p. m., but in the country dis
tricts feeep open until 6. With a Governor.
a Legitlature and county officers to elect,
all on one ballot, it will take at least
twenty-four hours to complete the count.
Some idea of the general trend of votes
in Ohio can probably be obtained from the
result of the counties in which Cincinnati
and Cleveland are respectively situated,
and these results will probably be known
comparatively early. The result of the
State, it is anticipated, will be pretty
much as it has been in previous years.
The doubtful points are Hamilton and
Cuyahoga counties. Chicago will control
Illinois. There will be no doubt of the {
outcome when the vote of Cook County is
recorded.
.But in other doubtful States like- In
diana, Michigan and Kansas, where State
and Legislative tickets also complicate
the ballots, there will probably be no key
note from which tlie result can De defin
itely determined on Tuesday night, un
less the election should prove a landslide.
In that ca^e midnight may give a close
idea who are the victors and who are the
vanquished. Otherwise there may be
many hours of anxious suspense.
The last two PresiUential elections have
been singularly free from uncertainty. It
was known at 10 p. m. on election day in
1888 that Mr. Harrison had defeated Mr.
Cleveland, and it waÃ known with equal
certainly at 11 p. m. on election day in
18'J2 that Mr. Cleveland had defeated Mr. j
Harrison. But in the election of 1884,
when Mr. Cleveland defeated Mr. Blame, I
the official result hung in doubt over the
vote of New York for days.
The fusion ticket 3 will add a further
element of difficulty in the Presiaential
count this year. Fusion has been ar
ranged between the People's party and the
Democrats on the electoral ticket in every
Democratic State but Tennessee, Missis
sippi, Georgia, Alabama, Florida and
Texan.
In several of the Southern States, while
there has been no formal fusion between
the Republicans and Populists on State,
Legislatures and Congressmen, local ar
rangements have been made that amount
to fusion, and will have more or less to do
with the result.
The following States will elect Governors
on November 3: Colorado, Connecticut,
Delaware, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kan
sas, Massachusetts, Michigan. Minne-ota,
Missouri, Montana, Nebra-ka, New Hamp
shire, New York, North Carolina, North
Dakota, South Carolina, South Dakota,
Tennessee, Texas, Washington, West Vir
ginia and Wisconsin.
The following States will elect Legisla
tures: California, Colorado, Connecticut,
Delaware, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, lowa,
Kansas, Kentucky (seven vacancies),
Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana,
Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New
York, New Jersey, North Carolina, North
Dakota, Pennsylvania. South Carolina,
South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah,
Virginia, Washington, West Virginia,
Wissonsin and Wyoming.

When the Disaster Occurs.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Oct. 25.â A head-end
collision occurred on the St. Louis and
San Francisco Railway, near Meramec
Highlands, at 10 o'clock this moraine, by
which nine people were killed and a score
injured. The scene ot the wreck is thir
teen miles west of this city.
The Valley Park accommodation train,
going east very fast on a down grade, came
into collision with the second section of a
westbound excursion train going to St.
James, Mo., and carrying 240 G. A. R.
men and their families. The impact de
molished both engines and wrecked or de
railed all the cars.
The first news of the wreck reached
Union Station, and a relief train carrying
pnysicians and nurses was at once sent
out, arriving at the wrect at noon. At 1
o'clock nine bodies had been recovered. It
is believed that at least two more are be
neath the wrecK. Of the twenty injured
eight are likely to die. Following is a list
of the dead :
Charles Hohl, engineer accommodation
train, St. Louis.
Conrad Kunze, excursionist, St. Louis.
Chirles Nobles, excursionist, St. Louis.
W. C. Btromberg, excursionist, St. Louis.
Frank Hasler, locomotive fireman, St.
Louis.
J. C. Blevius, passenger on accommoda
tion, Beckville, Mo.
William Cartwright, excursionist, Bt.
Louis.
Bernard McKenna, St. Louis, in charge
of refreshment car.
Mary McKenna, aged 14, assisting her
father.
The injuries of the following are
thought to be fatal. All are residents of
St- Louis:
Engineer Dryden of the excursion train.
Henry O3good, conductor excursion
train.
George Wolf, conductor accommodation
train.
Charles R. Milentz.
Mrs. Peter Hall.
Frank Garrity.
J. E. Triplet.
Frederick Lenz.
There were ten passengers in the two
cars of the accommodation train.
The front car of the excursion was the
commissary car, filled with refreshments,
and a number of passengers, mostly young
men. were grouped around the temporary
counter, eating, drinking and chatting.
This and the next car were completely
shattered. In- the coach following the
commissary car were seventy people.
These fared badly, especially from the
steam that poured forth from both boil
ers. Windows were broken in order to
secure ecress. The car had been turned
completely around and lodged alongside
the commissary car.
The seriously injured were treated and
cared for at Kirkwood, and those able to
travel and the uninjured were returned
to the city at 3p. m. â¢
It is known that Engineer Dryden had
orders to wait at Windsor siding, near
where the collision occurred, to allow the
accommodation to pass, but he increased
the train's speed and tried to overhaul the
first section of the train. The excursion
ists were going to St. James, Mo., to assist
in the dedication of a home for the aged
widows of veterans.

of a Boat.
DENVER, Colo., Oct. 25.â Andrew J.
Stupe, a grocer of this city, accompanied
by his wife and five children, went boat
iner on Smith's Lake this afternoon. While
moving about the occupants accidentally
capsized the boat, precipitating the entire
family into the water. Stupe seized the
youngest child and made desperate efforts
to right the boat.
The water, whish was ice cold, soon
chilled those who held to the sides of the
boat and all except Stupe released their
hold and disappeared beneath the surface
of the lake.
Stupe succeeded in clinging to the boat
until rescued, but the little child in his
arms died from exposure before the res
cuers arrived.
Searching parties are out to-night drag
ging the lake for the bodies of Mrs. Stupe
and the four children.

MACON, Ga., Oct. 25.â The remains of
ex-Speaker Charles F. Crisp were interred
in Oak Grove Cemetery in Americus this
afternoon at twilight.
The funeral train bearing the body of
Georgia's dead statesman lelt Atlanta at
7:30 a. m., arriving at Americus, his home,
at 2 p. x. The casket, placed in a special car,
under a guard of honor, bad a fall class
front so that his familiar face and form
could be viewed by those who loved and
honored him in life and now revere his
memory in death. The massive casket
was enshrined' in the silken folds of a
United States flag, while floral tributes of
love covered the walls of the car and were
piled in every available space. In the
same car, in a closed apartment, were
members of the family. At various sta
tions along the route people thronged by
thousands and were permitted to take a
last look at their departed friend.
The remains were accompanied by Gov
ernor Atkinson and staff, delegations from
Atlanta and other cities of the State,
members of the Georgia Bar Association,-
Hon. Hoke Smith, ex-Secretary of the In
terior; ex-Senator "Walsh of Augusta, Con
gressmen Charles L. Bartlett and J. C.
Black, ex-Congressmnn Barnes, a military
escort of commissioned officers of the
Fifth Georgia Regiment and several hun
dred citizens contributed by the towns
wherever the train stopped.
When, the train arrived at Americus
the entire population of the city had
gathered at the depot. The vast as
semblage stood in silence with uncovered
heads to show their respect and grief for
the dead. The tolling bells of the city
added to the solemnity of the occasion.
The casket was conveyed from the spe
cial car to the hearse, which was drawn

by four black horses, each led by a sable
groom.
The Americus Light Infantry and a dele
gation of forty citizens preceded the hearse,
and the procession started to the Metho
dist Church. The buildings along the
line of march were draped in mourning.
At 3:30 p. M., thÂ« funeral service began.
The deep mellow tone .of the organ pealed
forth a funeral dirge while the people were
assembling in the church. The choir
then saug "We Shall Sleep, but Not For
ever." After reading appropriate pas
sages of scripture and offering prayer,
General Clement A. Evans delivered a
funeral oration. His tribute to the de
ceased was impressively touching. As a
â¢comrade in arms in Virginia and a close
friend in time of peace, he knew well the
worth and character of the man he eulo
gized. His reference to the eminence
Mr. Crisp attained in his Congressional
career was free from any display of ful
some laudation, but told in that simplicity
which always marked the even tenor of
the life of the man Georgia mourns. No
higher tribute could be paid a National
character, nor is there who more justly
deserved it.
At the conclusion of General Evans' re
marks the choir sang "Asleep in Jesus."
The remains were then conveyed to the
cemetery.
The dwellings along the route were all
draped. The procession passed by the
house in which the Crisp family dwelt
years ago. Friends had placed a large
arch over the gateway on which were the
words, "His Old Home." People lined
the sidewalks from the church to the
cemetery.
Arriving at Oak Grove the military ranks
stood at "present arms." The remains
were carried to the family lot. A prayer
was read by General Evans and the body
of the dead statesman was lowered into
tho grave to sleep beneath the sod of
Georgia soil, under Southern skies, in the
city he loved and the section he served. It
was at deep twilight when their actof sor
rowful duty was performed, which added
to the gloom of the occasion. The people
were in silence and even in departing no
one was disposed to talk.
BETRAYED A. y . PA.Tj.
TUtsburg Safe- Cracker* Sounded Vp by
the I'olic.
WASHINGTON, Pa., Oct. 25.-Two
Pittsburg safe-crackers came to this place
last Wednesday to rob the United States
ExDress office and the Farmers' and
Mechanics' Bank. They were to have
been assisted in their work by two Wash
ington men. At 3 o'clock this morning
the Washington police force, armed with
shotguns, rounded up the quartet as the
members were making ready to blow open
the safe of the United States Express
Company. They were ail locked up. The
frustration of their plans was due to J. H.
Hoxworth, one of the local men, turning
State's evidence. He informed the police
of every move made by l.is comrades.
Jesse Miller, the other local man arrested,
has heretofore borne a good reputation.
The two Pittsburgers' gave fictitious
names, but all are believed to be expert
safe-crackers. Hoxworth was afterwards
i released from jail.
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
Every sign now indicates that the mon
ster Republican parade in this City next
Saturday afternoon will be the most mag
nificent public demonstration ever seen on
the Pacific Coast.
Grand Marshal Stone is making all pos
sible preparations to have every detail of
the demonstration arranged along sym
metrical lines, so as to insure an imposing
display of the patriotism of the loyal
friends of McKinley and Hobart, illus
trious champions of protection, prosperity
and National honor.
Enough responses have already been re
ceived from prominent Democrats and
Republicans of San Francisco and vicin
ityâmen who are stanch believers ih
found money and other features of the
Republican platform â to make it certain
that the character of the parade on the
occasion of Speaker Reed's arrival will be
notable for the high standing of those who
participate.
It promises to be a marvelous outpour
ing of men of all shades of political belief
who recognize McKinley and Hobart as
champions of all that stands for' Ameri
canism in its purest and best form. Those
who will thus express their feeling come
from all ranks and conditions of honor
able citizenship. Former Democrats will
march side by side with life-long Repub
licans, and those who delve fortheir daily
bread will walk shoulder to shoulder with
men whose fortunes are made.
There is the greatest imaginable inter
est in the interior, and it is now known
that scores of large delegations will come
from the principal towns of Northern and
Central California. Reports show greater
interest than ever before manifested in the
outcome of a National campaign.
Though this grand event will take place
in San Francisco, its character will be
more that of a State demonstration, for
there will be delegations from a large num
ber of cities and towns in Northern and
Central California.
The various committees have assurances
from transportation companies that ex
cursion rates to all points will be made.
The figure' will probably be so low as to
insure a large attendance from Sacra
mento, San Jose, Stockton and dozens of
towns within a hundred miles or more
of San Francisco.
The great parade will be an event long
to be remembered, having in itself many
elements that will commemorate the great
cause of freedom and progress for which
the Republican leaders stand; but the pa
rade and all its glories of music and march
ing will be but a paelude to tho event of
the night â a speech by Hon. Thomas B.
Reed of Maine, who is known wherever
the politics of the United States has at
tracted attention.
It is fit and proper that the greatest po
litical demonstration in the history of the
State should be crowned with a feast of
such oratory as a speech by the famous
Speaker of the House from Maine. As
Mr. Reed once lived in California the
demonstration will be somewhat in the
nature of an ovation to an old citizen, as
well as a tribute of loyalty to the peerless
leaders of the Republican ideas of Na
tional honor â protection and general
prosperity.
The following gentlemen have been ap
pointed a committee to meet Speaker
Reed at Los Angeles and escort him to
San Francisco: F. W. Van Sicklen, W. M.
Rank, M. H. de Young and Charles ai.
Shortridge.
In spite of positive announcements to
the contrary, a number of persons have
an idea that the grand parade is to be in
the evening. There should be no such
misunderstanding. Chairman Sumner of
the parade committee sends The Call the
following official information on the sub
ject:
To the Editor of the Call: There seems to be
an impression that more than one parade will
be given next Saturday. This is not the case.
There will be but one demonstration on that
date, which will be held in the afternoon by
request of the Republican btate Committee,
due to the fact that Mr. Reed is to speak in this
City on that evening. In this parade all Re
publican organizations in this and adjoining
cities have been invited to participate, to
gether with the business and laboring men of
tan Francisco.
It is cv.dent from the enthusiasm shown
yesterday at the meeting in the Chamber ol
Commerce that we will have the hearty co
operation of the business community, which
is Is favor of the election of McKiuley and Ho-
Dart, and believe it will be the greatest politi
cal demonstration ever held in the West. Very
truly yours, W. W. Sumner,
Chairman Parade Committee,
The grand maishal requests that all
clubs, associations, business men. leagues
and other organizations intending to take

information that may aid him in forming
the coiuran. It is the intention of those in
charge of the affair to do all in their power
to n.ake the procession imposing by reason
of its prace as well as its great numbers.
Charles B. TidbaK, who has had a wide ex

grand marshal.
Sam Weil. \V. C. B. de Fremmery, Wil

The character of the gentlemen on the
committee of arrangements shows that
the parade will represent the stable ele
ments of the community. They will pros
ecute their labors with unabated zeal from
now until Saturday. For the convenience
of persons who desire to take part in the

One of the pleasing features of the move
ment is the fact that the Women's Annex
of the National Republican League has
arranged an entertainment and dance
for the benefit of tne parade fund. It will
be given at the Pioneer building, 24 Fourth
street, to-night. Tickets will be sold for
50 cents. There will be considerable talent
in the entertainment. Henry Larsen and
Alfred "Wilkie are amone the artists who
will entertain the people.
Colonel George Stone, president of the
Union League Club and grand marshal of
the great industrial parade to take place
next Saturday, has every assurance that
many uniformed clubs from Oakland,
Sacramento, San Jose and olier cities will
join the vast marching column. Speak
ing of the parade last evening he said:
"This demonstration is at the sugges
tion of the Republican State Central Com
mittee, and the spirit of co-operation al
ready manifested assures a success far be
yond onr first anticipations. lam already
in receipt of inquiries by telephone and
telegraph from interior cities asking for
the excursion rate and assuring me that
if it is cut down low many uniformed
clubs will join the great column in San
Francisco. We shall surely have a great
day, and the first thing to be done to-day
is to have the railroad committee of the
parade and the agents of the various rail
road and steamboat lines converging in
the City arrange to give us a low rate.
"I am sure that the managers of the
Isorth Pacific Coast, the San Francisco
and North Pacific, the Southern Pacific
and the Valley lioad will join in effort 3to
bring a greater multitude to San Fran
cisco than ever before visited the City.
T.e uniformed clubs of Sacramento, Oak
land and San Jose will vie with the seven
teen uniformed marching clubs of San
Francisco in presenting a fane appearance.
The two uniformed clubs of Sacramento â
Â»the McKiniey League and the Capital
City Clvb â may make an exceptionally
fine display. Everybody knows what the
Alliance of Oakland can do when that
club is pat in line.
"It was the idea of the Republican State
Central Committee," said Colonel Stone,
"that the column on parade should repre
sent the business men and the laboring
men of Sarv Francisco. Every indication
now points to a vast representation. The
enternrise grows as the plan progresses.
"No, I have not yet fixed definitely on
the iccaiitv of formation or on the exact
line of march, but there will be but little
delay in this matter. The route will be
announced in ample time, so that patriotic
residents and business men on tbe line
may introduce special features of decora
tion. The Republican National Commit
tee has requested a general display of the
National Hag in all parts of the Union on
that day, October 31: and, while all may
observe this recommendation, the people
of San Francisco may go further and make
a beautiful display of patriotic decorations
in honor of the event."
The interest manifested in the event is
so absorbing that excursions will come
from all the interior towns. Invitations
have already gone out to the clubs of Oak
land, Aiameda, Berkeiey, Sausalito, San
Jose, Santa Rosa, San Rafael, Petaluma,
Redwood City and other places in this im
mediate vicinity. A very low railroad rate
would bring organizations from Stockton,
Fresno arid tae San Joaquin Valley regi. in.
In business circles the parade is dis
â ussed with eager interest. Stores and
places of business will be closed next
Saturday. The general sentiment is in
favor of making a day of the demonstra
tion. The industrial f satures of the parade
will iend renewed interest to the ooeanOÃ.
Already business men are selecting their
marching partners. Evan .1. Coleman, who
marched with Dr. Gwin on the occasion of
the Hancock parade and again with him
on the occasion of the (iarfield funeral,
will this time march with Uncle Georee
T. Bromley. Dr. Gwin was 75 years old
wLen he marched over the cobbles. Like
Oliver Wendell Holmes, Uncie George is
80 years young.
When the Republican State Central
Committee advised the parade to wind up
with an evening demonstration in honor
of Tom Reed, calculations were made that
100,000 thousand people would review tho
marching column. Since tbe idea was
first introduced the plan has attained Hub
a measure of popular support and patriotic
impulse that it is now believed 200,000
people will line the streets and cheer the
marching column.
Obviously the uniformed c;ubs, under
the eye of so much assembled beauty, and
under the gaze of so many admiring
friends, will seek to rival each other in
style and precision of movement.
The grand marshal is exceedingly
anxious that ail clubs from the City and
surrounding country that desire to partic
ipate should advise him at the earliest
possible time. In order to make the as
signment to the various divisions, no
delay should occur in apprising the grand
jnarshal. There will be a meeting of the
parade" committee to-day at 24 Fourth
street.
OAKLAND WILL BE HERE.
The Famous Alliance Will March
In the* Great Parade.
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct 25.â This city
will be well represented in San Francisco
next Saturday on the occasion of the great
Republican demonstration. There has
not yet been any arrangement of the de
tails, but whatever is to be done will ba
decided upon Monday or Tuesday. On
the Monday following the San Francisco
parade Congressman Reed is to be in this
city and a grand demonstration is being
prepared, with floats and all variety of
novelties, and this will, of course, deter
this city from doing as much in the direc
tion of display as would otherwise have
been attempted. There will, however, be
several uniformed clubs on parade and
hundreds of citizens in the march.
Varney W. Gaskill, commander of the
Republican Alliance, who has been ap
pointed grand marshal of the local parade,
is also working for the San Francisco
demonstration. "Oakland will have a
good showing across the bay," he said to
night, "and, of course, we shall be there."
The "we" referred to by him is the
Alliance. " Everything and everybody
that we can get into line will go across
to San Francisco for the night parade, but
I do not know just what we may do in the
day parade. I think all the uniformed
clubs will go, and the Sound Money League
and a large representation of business
men."
Major Bromwell says that Oakland is
going to send San Francisco a big show,
and in return expects that the bigger city
will send the cream of her Republican
clubs to Oakland on Monday night. "Of
course, we are busy laying our plans for
the eve of election)" said the major, "but
that will not stop us from going to San
Francisco next Saturday. 1 cannot
say at this time whether tbe business
men will arrange some trades demonstra
tion for Saturday afternoon, but I have no
doubt they will be communicated with by
the San Francisco committee to-morrow
and will theu decide on their plans."
BERKELEY FOR THE RALLY.
The College Town Will Send Hun
dreds to the Parade,
BERKELEY, Cal., Oct. 25.â The Re
publicans of Berkeley are highly enthu
siastic over the grand parade of McKin
leyites to be held next Saturday afternoon
in San Francisco. A large numioer of the
leading local representatives of the party
were interviewed to-day with the aim of
j obtaining their views as to what the great
I demonstration would mean to Repub
i licans, and they agreed to a man that it
wiiJ be a fitting climax to a well-fought
campaigu. Professors, private citizens,
local business men and students are of one
voice in their support of the place for the
monster parade of Republicans from
around the bay, and the indications are
very favorable that a delegation of no less
! than 400 will turn out from Berkeley
! alone. The McKinley League, the East
[ Berkeiey Republican Club, the West
| Berkeley Republican Club, the Lorin Re
i publican Club and the Students' Republi
can Cud will hold meetings during tbe
week to take formal action in the matter
of sending delegations. The Berkeley
Repuolican Club will meet to-morrow
i craning to discuss the matter.
Joseph McClain, president of the Mc-
I Kinlfy Ltatue, said tonight:
"Wnile I Jo not speak for the club, as
| that organization will take formal action
I of its own, I can say that as an individual
| 1 am willing to close my place of business
â  and take an active part in the demonstra
; tion. I believe that all the business men
| of Berkeley who are Republicans should
j be wiliing'todo likewise."
William Lair Hili, president of the
i Berkeley Republican Clubâ Everything
tn.it will tend to advance the cause of
' McKinleyism should be continued to be
I done until the very last hour of the cam
paign. The proposed demonstration will,
without a douot, be conducive of much
good. The question of sending a delega
i tion will be formally brougiit~to the at
, tention of our league in a day or so. I feel
; quite certain that they will support the
j movement.
Howard E. Wright, Republican nomi
| nee for Assemblyman â I believe that a
j movement of the kind proposed will be
productive of great good. It will tend to
induce the men on the fence to climb
down on the side of Republicanism. I
intend taking an active part myself, and
will induce as many others to do so as
possible.
Joseph L. Scotchler, chairman of the
County Central Committee in 1888 â I am
in favor of doing everything possible to
keep the people in line until November 3.
We have a big lot of good Republicans in
Berkeley, and I am confident that many
will turn out on Saturday. Of the 2000
voters in Berkeley 1 believe that at least
1300 will cast the Republican ticket next
month.
James Palache â If I were physically
able, which unfortunately I am not, it
I would be my greatest desire to fall into
! line and march with the rest of tbe loyai
i Republicans. I do not wish to see the
i matter of a big celebration attempted and
i result in a failure, but I feel quite certain
j that the proposed demonstration for
Saturday afternoon will meet with the
ereatest "success.
F. M. Wilson â I am heartily in favor of
I he idea of giving a big celebration just
I before election. I will be there and do
; wnat I can to make it a success.
Robert Edgarâ Such a turnout of Repub
â  licans as is proposed can be nothing else
| but beneficial to the party. It will serve
as a fitting climax to the long and hard
fought campaign.
Coionei Ayers â Every Republican in
Berkeley should lay aside his business for
that afternoon and join in the big cele
bration in San Francisco. That McKin
ley will be our next President there is no
doubt, but getting into good hnmor before
election day will do us no harm.
J. K. Steuart â We must all do every
thing we can to make tbe San Francisco
celebration a success. All tbe Republican
clubs about the bay should be repre
sented.
Captain Morrison â The work for McKin
ley snould be kept up till the very last â
the grandest celebration of the campaign
should be held just before election day, and
| next Saturday afternoon seems to be the
i most fitting time for this.
H. D. Kelseyâ The idea is a good one.
i It is not that we need to have such a ceie-
I bration, but it will be well ior us to g*a
i into line together at least once before elec
j tion for the satisfaction of seeing what an
I army we <*an turn out, if for nothing more.
George L. Strieker â The parade will be
! a good thing. AU Alameda County should
ibe represented. Berkeley is especially
i strong in Republicanism this year.
FROM INTERIOR POINTS.
Large Representations Will March
in the Great Parade.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Oct. 25.â There is a
movement here to get up one of the largest
excursions that ever left this city to attend
the Republican demonstration at San Fran
cisco Saturday afternoon. All the Repub
lican organizations here are interested
and will send strong delegations if nego
tiations now in process are concluded fa
vorably. Dr. D. K. McGraw, president of
the County Republican Leaeue, stated
this evening that he had received for the
league and McKinley Battalion an invita
tion to participate in the parade. The in
vitation came from Colonel George Sione

Francisco. The battalion, it is promised,
will be in line at least eighty-four strong.
If satisfactory rates are secured it is ex
pected that not less than 2000 persons
from San Jose will attend the demonstra
tion. Many Republicans here express a
desire to reciprocate for the fine attend
ance of uniformed clubs from San Fran
cisco in the parade here last evening.
STOCKTON. Cal., Oct. 25.â Chairman
Nelson of the Republican County Central
Committee to-night said that the mem
bers of the McKiniey Club of this city are
now considering the question of going in
a Dody to participate in tbe big parade in
San Francisco next Saturday. The club
and all the members of the County Com
mittee are busy arranging for the recep
tion to and the address of Speaker Tom
Reed, and after that event the will arrange
to participate in the San Francisco dem
onstration.
If it is possiDle the local Republican
club will go io a body, but if this arrange
ment cannot be made numbers will go
anyway, together with many leading Re
publicans of this city not members of the
club. Chairman Nelson is sanguine over
the outlooK in this county. He said to
night the prospect for the success of Mc-
Kinley and protection was brighter than
at any time during the campaign.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Oct. 25.â 1f a
cheap rate can be arranged between Vere
and San Francisco the RepuDlicans of
Santa Cruz will send a stronz delegation

protection and honest money and all are
anxious to honor that great exponent of
Republicanism, Thomas B. Reed.

to 300 Republicans from Vallejo will at

ASTOR AT THE THROTTLE
An Engineer Surprised by His
Request to Handle tbe
Locomotive.
Bat the Distinguished Jobn Jacob
Knew the Business and Runs
a Mi'e a Minute.
LOUISVILLE, Ky., Oct. 25.â John Jacob
Astor was one of the party of Illinois
Central directors who came to Louisville
yesterday on an inspection visit. He is a
practical mechanical engineer, as well as
an author and social engineer. When the
train reached Pulton, Ky., yesterday morn
ing he remarked to One of the party, "I
guess I'll take a ride on the engine. I
know it's dirty, but I've been there be
fore."
He climbed into the cab and when his
tall form, topped with an extremely Eng
lish white hat, appeared in the cab, the
engineer was surprised.
"Now, let's see you run the machine,"
said Mr. Astor to the engineer and the
fireman opened the door of the furnace
and began to shovel in the coal. The en
gine increased its speed at every foot. The
engineer threw open tbe throttle, and the j
engine sped alone like a thing frightened, j
Mr. Astor made two or three motions as |
if to take hold of tho lever, but desisted. 1
Finally he said to the engineer, "Lend me |
your cap."
"Sir?" answered the engineer with a
look of surprise.
"Lend me your cap. I want to run this
encine," he replied.
â¢'What?' exclaimed the surprised en
gineer.
"I want to run this engine," declared
Mr. Astor, with a look of determination on
his face.
"But you'll run it off the track," sug
gested the engineer, fearfully.
"I never did before," answered the well
dressed passenger, and with that he took
his place at the front end of the cab, with
tbe grimy cap of the engineer pulled over
his eyes, aad his hand on the lever. He
handed his hat to the engineer, wbo in a
rit of absent-mindedness placed it on his
head.
"I'll take half his money and trade
places with him," remarked the engineer
to the fireman under his breath.
Mr. Astor opened the throttle until the
train made sixty miles an hour. Mr.
A -tor sat on the engine until it rolled into
Horse Cave. He thanked the engineer for
the experience, took his hat and joined his
party in the coaches.

GALA TIMES FOE A LITTLE TOWN
Hundreds of Illinois Farmers Will
Flock Into Jacksonville to Hear
the Orator.
JACKSONVILLE, 111., Oct 25.â AU
church-going Jacksonville turned out this
morning to see Mr. and Mrs. W. J. Bryan,
and during most of the day tbe residence
of Dr. Hiram K. Jones, where they are
stopping, was surrounded by carious peo
ple. It was in this old educational town
that Mr. Bryan spent six years of bis life
as a student, two at Whipple Academy,
and the rest at the Illinois State College.
Mrs. Bryan, too, was a pupil at the Jack
sonville Female Academy, and the ac
quaintance which culminated in their
marriage began here. The candidate and
his wife naturally anticipated a pleasant
stay in such familiar environments, and
they spent a delightful Sunday, meeting
old friends and talking with them over
their college days. .
Although Mr. and Mrs. Bryan did not
reach Jacksonville until nearly 2 o'clock
this morninir, after a run through the
night over the Burlington road from
Quincey, many people had waited up too
see them and to cheer the candidate.
Little rest was allowed the nominee in
that fast ride.
He was awakened twice â the first time
to make a midnight speech to a big audi
ence of torch-bearers and shouters at
Bluffs, and again at Mount Sterling,
where neitber the lateness of the hour nor
the fact that it was Sunday could stay tbe
enthusiasm of the Bryanites tnere. The
Jacksonville people who awaited the ar
rival of their former townsman were dis
appointed, for Mr. Bryan remained in his
berth and did not leave the train until
nearly 9 o'clock this morning. With Mrs.
Bryan he went to the house of Dr. Jones
and later in the forenoon attended divine
service at the State-street Presbyterian
Church, where the pastor, Rev. A. M.
Morey, preached a sermon that had noth
ing in it about silver or gold. The church
was crowded to the doors. A number of
small boys and some others who were not
so small, all wearing stripe of yellow rib
bon, followed Mr. and Mrs. Bryan from
their carriage into the building and gave
a suppressed hurrah for McKinley.
Four houses of worship, including that
attended by Mr. and Mrs. Bryan, occupy
the four corners of the streets, and the
congregations of all of these were dis
missed within a .few minutes of each
other, so that with the 500 or more who
bad been waiting outside for the two most
interesting persons in Jacksonville to ap
pear, State-street Presbyterian Church
was surrounded by quite a large assem
blage as the candidate and his wife hur
riedly made their way to a waiting car
riage and were driven back to the resi
dence of their host.
Mr. Bryan slent part of the day and the
| rest of his spare time received old iriends.
When he went out at duss, accompanied
by Mrs. Bryan, to tea with F. Dunlap. a
J Jacksonville banker, with whom he had
| been associated in local politics while a
resident here, Dr. Jones' house was the
center of interest for several hundred peo
ple here, many of them in carriages, who
had waited patiently for a long time to see
the Democratic nominee.
To-morrow morning Mr. Bryan will
visit the State College and probably talk
to the students about the time when he
was an undergraduate. In the afternoon
he will make a speech in the public en
closure known as "the square," and at 5
o'clock will leave on his special train for
j Alton. Many farmers drove into town to
night, and the ciiauces are that with ex
pected excursionists to augment the Jack
sonville people who want to hear Mr.
Bryan, one of the biggest crowds that
ever gathered in this town of colleges will
attend the political meeting in honor of
the Democratic candidate.
FRO BRYAN AND SILVER
Jirotcjt, the Political Acrobat. Indonet
the Chicago I'latfor'n.
LINCOLN, Nebe., Oot 25.â Hon. E. E.
Brown, a prominent local banker and
business man, has given oat a letter in
which he strongly indorses the Chicago
platform and candidates. Mr. Brown was
atone time a Republican member of the
Legislature. Changing to Democracy last
Spring, Mr. Brown acted as chairman of
the silver notification meeting held in this
city cany in September.
In his statement Mr. Brown says that
all of our National bonds are payable in
coin â silver as well as gold â and quotes
Congressional resolutions to show that
authority to issue gold bonds has twice
been refused by Congress. Referring to
President Cleveland's special message to
Congress in January, 1895, asking the
right to issue gold bonds, Mr. Brown says:
"This request on the part of the Presi
dent was referred to the Committee on
Ways and Means, a majority of which re
ported in favor of conterring the right. A
minority report was drawn and presented
by W. j". Bryan, Democratic candidate for
the Presidency. After full discussion and
mature deliberation the minority report
was adopted and the right to issue gold
bonds was denied."
Discussing National honor as an issue of
the campaign, Mr. Brown declares it to be
his view that "National honor would be
equally impaired by yielding to an unjust
demand as it would in failing to comply
with a just one."
Mr. Brown quotes speeches from tho
late General John A. Logan and Senator
Tdurston of Nebraska, delivered at various
times in the past favoring free coinage.
and concludes with a declaration of fealty
to Mr. Bryan and silver.

CHRISTIANS CANNOT VOTE.
So Says Rev. Mr. Foster of New York's
Third Reformed Presbyterian
Church.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 25.â 1n his ser
mon to-day Rev. F. M. Foster of the Ihird
Reformed Presbyterian Cburch in West
Twenty-third street said that as the con
stitution of the United States did not rec
ognize God in it all citizens loyal to Christ
were debarred from voting.
"It is the duty of the Christians to re
fuse to swear allegiance to the constitution
of a government which does not recognize
the authority of Almighty God," said he.
Mr. Foster &aid that tbe laws of God are
broken every Sunday by the Government,
and as an example he stated: "The Gov
ernment will admit into the service of the
Postoffice Department only those who will
swear that they will violate the fourth
commandment and keep the office open
on the holy day. The candidate for office
must, according to the constitution, swear
that he will uphold the laws which con
tradict the laws of God. The Christian
loyal to Christ cannot take such an oath,
or, if he does, he becomes a sharer in ail
the wickedness which is fostered and pro
tected by this Government. As all candi
dates must take this oath, the Christian
citizen is debarred from voting on the
principle that he cannot ask another what
he might not do himself.
"The Christian citizen cannot vote be
cause the constitution does not require
God's qualifications for official trust.
Moral qualifications are required in the
office bearer."
The Rev. Mr. Foster said after the ser
mon that none of his congregation would
vote on election day.
GRAND OPERA IN GOTHAM
Cpening of the Season by Colonel
Mapleson at the Academy
of Music.
Many New Artists and Some Charm*
ing Vocalists to Delight the
New Yorkers.
. NEW YORK. N. V., Oct. 25.â A notable
event in the annals of grand opera will be
the opening of i the season by Colonel
Mapleson at the Academy of Music to
morrow night. The auditorium has un
dergone a general overhauling. The pros
cenium boxes are there still, but the grand
tier which was the ; social glory of the
house is gone. Those boxes and the mez
zanine row have been cut out and chairs
put in their places. In fact the interior has
been transformed to the old-time appear
ance. With the exception of Andrea
Chenier there will be no great operatic
novelties presented, but there are a good
many new artists, among them some
charming vocalists. " .
They are new to New Yorkers, "but,"
says Colonel Mapleson, "so were Nilsson,
Gerster and others when . I introduced
them." Speaking of Gerster the colonel
said ; "She sings as charmingly as ever.
I heard her sing the 'Ah non credea' with
all the 'old-time tenderness arid sym
pathy, all the exquisite pathos of old, and
the 'Ah non giunge 1 with as much bril
liancy as iin her best days, not a note
slurred, not a bit of noriture omitted.
Her voice in every particular but one is
everything it once was. It lacks volume.
It is like a distant echo; it sounds as
though the singer were miles away â as
though 'â . the voice came f from a phono
graph â clear, sweet, perfect, brilliant in
execution, but diminished ; the same effect,
I might say, that is produced visually by
looking at "Â« the stage through the wrong
en-! of an opera glass. She intends to de
vote her life to teaching. She seems to be
in good health and in good spirits."
From the present outlook the season is
bound to be a success.

PROTEST AGAINST CRUELTIES.
Indignation Meeting of the Irish National
Amnesty Association at New
York.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 25.â An in
dignation meeting held to-night under the
auspices of the Irish National Amnesty
Association to protest against the brutali
ties to which Dr. Tnomas Gallagher,
George Albert Whitehead and other
American political prisoners were sub
jected in English prisons, was a great
success. Tne hall was crowded and Hon.
Morgan J. O'Brien, Judge of the Supreme
Court, presided. He received an ovation.
Judge O'Brien then said that it was per
fectly natural that the Government of
this country should protest against the
crimes and outrages perpetrated upon
American citizens in British dungeons.
"I'he President of the United States,"
said be, "took prompt action in the Vene
zuelan matter a snort time ago and told
England to keep her hands off that coun
try. I say that the principle involved in
Venezuela was not so great as that in
volved here. The Venezuelan question
concerned land: the question involved
here involves tbe question of humanity."
Telegrams cf regret were read frcm
prominent persons who could not attend.
Resolutions were adopted deploring the
treatment accorded to the Irish political
prisoners in English prisons, and calling
upon the United States Government to
make such protests as will cause a mitiga
tion of the punishment accorded to those
still confined there on similar charges.
A collection was taken and it was an
nounced $2000 nad been realized.
Dr. Edward McGlynu, the last speaker,
said in part:
"We are here to-night to plead for the
most iielpless of men. The tramp and the
pauper are princes in their freedom com
pared with the prisoners who are in the
clutches of the law. But I take it that
this meeting is not a defiance of Great
Britain. We are met here in the interests
of conciliation, and to remonstrate, ex
postulate and request the liberation of the
Irish-American prisoners in British
prisons, rather than to defy."
Dr. McGlynn stated that the movement
was an appeal for mercy for men whose
only fault was that they loved their coun
try well. The revelation of tbe mental
arid physical condition of Dr. Gallagher
and of Whitehead had been as much of a
shock to the English people as to the
friends of the prisoners tnemselves.
In concludinz Dr. McGJynn said: "Moral
suasion should be used, and public senti
ment will result in securing tue liberty of
the men stilt in prison."

discuss the issues of the day, and claimed
that the Republicans had forced the con
sideration of political matters on this day
of the week. He quoted a local paper as
having said the Â±lepublican party stood
for religion, morality and law and order.
As examples of these great principles, he
cited Bob Ingersoll for religion, W. C. P.
Breckinridge for morality and Herr Most
for law and order â all of these men being
pronounced in their support of the Re
publican party in this campaign.
The speaker quoted Ingersoll's strong
indorsement of bimetallism in the lec
tures delivered in Colorado in 1893, when
no political campaign was on, and said
that, in view of his change of position this
year, he considered the colonel "the great
est repudiationist in the world." This,
however, was no new character, as years
ceo Coionei Ingersoll had repudiated
Moses and tbe prophets, the Apostles and
tbe Martyr, his Savior and his God, and
had now only reach d the climax by re
pudiating himself. [Hearty and uproari
ous applause.] The wonder was that he
did not repudiate the silver dollar long
ago because it was inscribed "In God We
Trust."
Mr. Pence then turned his attention to
Bourke Cockran, the mention of whose
name brought out hisses and cries of ''He's
a rat."
He said New York had held the Democ
racy of the country by the throat since
1863, nominating every Presidential can
didate since the war. This time the sov
ereign people of the South and West had
declared it would select a man who would
tit the Democratic platform it bad adopted.
Now the New York Democracy sends out
its leaders to disrupt the party. Quoting
Cockran's famous speech in 1892 denounc
ing the mugwumps, he pronounced Cock
ran the attorney of the mugwump? in this
campaign and thanked "*.he=e men" for
their example, saying if tLey could thus
easily shake off their party affiliations, so
could be and his Republican friends.
[Great cheering and a voice: "Plenty of
us here."]
"Who controls the Republican party?'
he asked, and a shout went up: "Mark
Hanna."
Referring to the youth of Mr. Bryan,
the speaker said it was enough that he
was as old as tbe fathers of the constitu
tion considered necessary, and that he is
as old as Thomas Jefferson when be wrote
I the Declaration of Independence.
The position of the two great parties on
tbe currency question, as outlined in their
platforms of 1884, 1888, 1892 and tbe
present year, were reviewed, and the al
leged entire change cf hear; on the part
of the Republican party pointed out.
Referring to tbe pxst glories of the Re
publican party, he related the story of a
snake which had sot .into an eagle's nest
during the absence on the latter, and ap
plied to Mark Hanna the snake's reply to
the question bow he got there: "I crawled
up." [Cheers, and hisses for Hanna. l
He declared that Lincoln, the friend of
tbe mas-es, and Douglas would both be
for fr*e coinage were they alive to-day,
but, "It is true their sons are against vs â
but the best of stock will run down."
A reference to Carnegie called forth an
other storm of hisses. In conclusion Mr.
P^nce conjured his hearers, when they go
i to the polling booths, to remember tbeir
j wives and children, and to vote to protect
their interests.
Charles Thomas of Colorado and Judge
Fleming of Kentucky also spoke.
CONDITION OF WEST POINT
Colonel Ernst Reports the Mili
tary Academy in a Flour
ishing Condition.
Recommendation Made That tbe Num
ber of Cadets Be Materi
ally Increased.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Oct, 25.â The
Military Academy at West Point is in a
nourishing condition, according to the an
nual report to the War Department of
Colonel Ernst, superintendent, who says
it is passing through an era of improve
ment, so far as its equipment and outward
physical condition are concerned, due to
the greater liberality of Congress in recent
years. The curriculum, both theoretical
and practical, is tbe result of many years'
experience and has proved itself well
adapted to the institutions.
Improvements in that direction are less
rapid and less radical than in the other,
but there also the academy is advancing
as will appear from a perusal cf the ap
pendixes already referred to as attached
to this report. The professors and officers
are accomplished, enchin his sphere, and
devoted to tbeir work and deserve well of
the Government.
The number of cadets this year, 332, in
cluding one foreigner receiving instruc
tion by special authority of Congress, is
the largest ever belonging to the academy
at one time. The recommendation is re
newed that Senators be allowed to appoint
two cadets at large from each State, there
by increasing the number of cadets. The
health of the command during the year
was far from satisfactory.
There were epidemics of influenza
malarial fevers, measles and whoopiugl
cough. There were several cases of ap
pendicitis and other desperate diseases.
Only one cadet died.
An abundance of good healthy food in
sufficient variety, was furnished, at 'an
average cost of 53 cents per day per man
Clothing, books and other articles were
secured at low rates, except the case of
drawing instruments each cadet bad to
purchase. These cost $23 05, or more than
half a month's pay.
Colonel Ernst says: "The instrument
are imported, none of suitable quality
being made in this country. The duty
upon them is 35 per cent. Neither the
quantity nor quality should be reduced,
and the price is as low as it can oe made if
the custom-house duties are paid. Legis
lation is recommended remitting the
duty."
"BRYAN IS AN ANARCHIST."
General Lew Wallace Pay* His Respect*
to Ihe Aebraskan.
LAFAYETTE, Ind., Oct. 25.-The tray*
elinz men's Republican demonstration
last night was an immense : affair. Alter
the parade the opera-house was crowded.
General Lew Wallace paid his respects to
Bryan. He referred to Bryan's assertion
that he was not an anarchist, and said he
believed he could prove that be was. Wal
lace then quoted a portion of Altgeld's
speech denouncing government by injunc
tion; in which Altgeld declared that if
McKinley "â  was elected he â would send
troops at Herr Most's request to every vil
lage to oppress the poor."
This language, the general declared,
was that of an anarchist. He then
auotedfrom Bryan's speech, wherein he
championed Altgeld as "the able defender
of the principles of the Chicago conven
tion," arid spoke of him as "the candidate
of our party for Governor," and advised
people to "vote for him." "
This, the general proclaimed, was suffi
cient evidence that Bryan was an anar
chist He was repeatedly cheered.

BRUTALITIES IN THE ARMY.
One Bully in Uniform Bsats a Pri
vate Until the Poor Fellow
Commits Suicide.
BERLIN, Gei.many, Oct. 2.s.â The pro
gress of the Presidential election campaign
in the United States is watched with
the keenest interest, though more front a
financial point of view than with any idea
of contrasting the social positions occu
pied by the candidates.
It is difficult, however, to get as yet even
from the leading newspapers which de-
TOte columns of space to the subject| an
intelligent appreciation of the situation.
Voluminous letters are received here by
mail conveying to Germans the develop
ments of the struggle in which so many of
their countrymen are interested, but few
of the newspapers here follow an intelli
gent line of argument in discussing the
questions which the campaign compre
hends.
The Vossiscbe Zeitung publishes an
article notab!e from among the others in
which it embodies the general German
notion of the situation. In the course of
. the editorial the paper says it is a rare
thing in the political history of the United
States that the Democrats of the old
school stand solidly together, shoulder to
shoulder, with their old Republican op
ponents to light against the so-called can
didate of the National Democratic party.
Mr. Bryan, and it is still more surprising
to old observers of political campaigns to
see the Democrats of the Eastern States
standing up for McKinley despite the fact
thai he is the apostle of the doctrine of a
high protective tariff, which they have
consistently combated for years.
The Vosshche, quoting from the New
York Handelszeitung in regard to the
platform upon which Mr. Bryan is mak
ing iiis campaign, proceeds to argue that
neither the principle of the currency nor
that of the tariff especially inspires Mr.
Bryan ar.d his followers, who, the paper
â ays. simply strive to carry themselves
along the old lines of belief that the spoils
belong to the victors. The article con
cludes by saying that neither the victory
of McKinley nor the success of Bryan ran
ultimately affect the economic movement
in the United States, which aepends upon
causes far beyond the struggle which is
now taking place between the gieat politi
cai parties of America. The paper also
ricii:ules thy rumors v.'hich have been cur
rent in the columns of the English papers,
furnished by their American correspond
ents, and which have been reproduced
here, that the situation in the United
States is such at the present time That a
very narrow issue could involve civil war,
and says that the German?, comprising a
considerable part of the American popu
lace, would at ail events accept the result
of the election without the slightest dream
of revolt against the voice of the majority,
as expressed by the suffrages of the people.
The Kreuz Zeitung is rather inclined
to support Bryan against the sound-money
men and denies that his speeches can be
construed as a menace of rebellion, as his
opponents have alleged. The paper, how
ever, condemns the Bryanite suggestions
favoring the lepeal of the civil service re
form enactments of Congress, and con
cludes l>y saying that the German electors
in the United States seem to he again de
sirous to distinguish themselves as "the
fjienas of their enemies, for that is what
they do when they hold the stirrup for the
llenubiicans to mount."
Ti;fe cowardly act of Lieutenant!Bruz
witz in murdering an unarmed civilian in
a cafe in Carlsruhe, for which he was con
demned to four years' imprisonment and
dismissal from the army, instead of being
sentenced to death, as he should have
been, is stiJi the th-me of general discus
sion, and ii likely to lead to a general abo
lition of the swashbuckling practices in
which army officers, too frequently
drunk, have hitherto indulged, and conse
quently to a oetter feeling of public se
curity when those aristocratic brawlers in
the uniform of the "deienders of the em
pire" arc abroad.
Since the downfall of the poltroon, Bruz
wiiz, many incidents of a character simi
,lar to that of his dastardly attack upon
Siebemann at Carisruhe have been brought
to light, showing the extent to whicn the
uniform of the Kaiser's army is being dis
graced by officers upon whom its encase
ment has tbe effect of turning their heads.
Among the ncently revealed cases of
brutality on the part of officers there
comes to the front the murder of a private
named Karl Bauer, attached to the gar
rison at Riediinnen, Wurtemberg. An
officer whose name is not made public,
presumably because of the strength of the
influence behind him, look a dislike to
Bauer and for some trivial offense caused
him to be strioped and scrubbed until he
was almost flayed, pieces of the victim's
fckin nangmg from his body. After this
treatment Bauer was rolled up in a large
piece of carpet and thrasher! with heavy
sticks. He was then released and sent to
his quarters in the barracks. Crushed
with humiliation and racked with pain
Bauer tried to commit suicide, whereupon
the lieutenant wno had caused him to be
punished went to him and beat him with
the flat of his sword until he cried like a !
child.
The wretched man was then left alone, |
and a second time he attempted suicide.
He fired a shot at his head, but, being
almost exhausted from the effects of his
brutal treatment, he only succeeded in
grazing his leniple: He then put the
muzzle of his pistol in his mouth and fired
again, the second shot crashing through
the loof of his mouih. In a dying con
dition he iay upon the ground for several i
hours, expiring finally from loss of blood.
Ti:e military court at Rledlingen took
cognizance of the man's d ath, and after
deliberation rendered a verdict of suicide,
ignoring the causes which drove the poor
fellow to kill himself.
The new emigration bill which the Gov
eniment has proposed for submission to
the Reichstag at the next session of that
body, which will begin on November 9,
Mffers from the previous measure in
modifying the restrictions against emigra

-^t la reported that a sugar ring is in
rrocess^)f formation whose membership
will consist of 400 German sugar manu
li'-ctnrers. This organization proposes 10
i estajffisn a centra! point for the sale of the
product of (ierraan sugar manufacturers,
and negotiations are in progress with a
view of connecting the organization with
'Vlf Â£ us . tnan aiul Russian sugar trnsts.
lhe t reisinr.ige Zeitung, in an article an
nouncing the proposed formation of this
ring, says the scheme is a gross outrage. I
haviae for its object the exploitation oJ |
consumers in an attempt to cement an op
pressive German sugar monopoly. The
scheme, tho Zeitung says, must be sup
pressed at all hazards.
The Bismarckian newspaper organs, in
their comments upon the marriage of the
Prince of Naples, Crown Prince of Italy,
to Princess Helene of Montenegro, which
took place in Rome yesterday, connect the
incident with an Enelish intrigue, whose
object is to isolate Germany and cause the
withdrawal of Italy from the Dreibund.
Maximiiian Harden, writing to the Zu
kunlt, says that the Dreibund is now only
an external semblance of an alliance.
Germany, he says, cannot reckon upon
her allies, as she knows full well that
Russia may at any moment give her as
sent to the scheme of an enemy (brance)
frantic for revenge. The Zukunfi, In its
comments upon the communication, traces
the present position of Germany back to
the policy of the Emperor and his Chan
cellor, General yon Caprivi, of disrupting
that of Prince Bismarck and endeavoring
to conciliaie Russia.
The Berliner Tageblatt, criticizing
Prince Bismarck's communications to the
Hamburger Nachrichten, the Chancellor's
personal organ, upon the origin of the
entente between Russia ami 1< ranee,
charges the Prince with having used hi 3
influence so discredit the Government of
the Kaiser before the world, and suggests
that the time has come when it is imper
ative that the current disclosures and
criticisms adverse to the real interests of
Germany should he stopped.
INSURGENTS ARE VICTORIOUS.
Maceo and His Followers Bombard a
Town and Cross the Trocha Into
Havana Province.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 25.â A Herald
special from Key "West, Fla., says:
"Well-informed passengers from Havana
contiim advices received by mail that
Maceo has crossed the trocha at Artemisa
ami joined other insurgent lorces in Ha
vana piovince.
The declare that the report circulated by
Maceo of his encampment at Cucarajicara,
and a con emplated attack on that town,
was mercy a feint of the rebel leader to
concentrate the Spanish troops at that
point.
That the rnse was successful is proved
by the fact that General Gonzales Munoz,
with large forces, was sent in that direc
tion to attack Maceo, but npon their ar
rival at Cacarajicara the Spaniards found
nothing but a deserted camp.
Maceo's followers under forced marches
then made a detour to the southward and
suddenly appeared at Artemisa, the cen
tral post on the trocha line. Giving his
men temporary rest the insurgent chief
sent word to the commandant that he in
tended to bombard the town, giving the
inhabitants live hours in which to leave
the city. *
Not heeding Maceo's threats, the Span
iards would permit no one to leave. The
result is known from the reports which
have already been cabled from Havana.
Maceo opened fire on the town with his
artillery and thirty shots from the rebel
dynamite gun were thrown into the city.
EvÂ«?ry building is said to have been
leveled while the slaughter of noncom
batants was appalling, During the car
nage Maceo and his followers crossed the
line of the trocha into Havana province,
where they joined the fore, s of General
Aguirre.

LAWRENCE, Mass., Oct. 26.â A fire
started in the Wasnington mills at 11
o'clock to-night. It started in what is
known as niili No. 24. Tiiis is used as a
dry-room and tons of dried wools are
stored there. In a few minutes the fire
was conquered in the drying-room, but it
had spread to the main mill.
It ran along the outside until it reached
Mill 2, but was put out by automatic
sprinklers. It then broke out in the '.vet
finishing- room and went from there to the

THE BAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, OCTOBER 26. 1596.
CAN'T OWN ANY
LAND IN JAPAN
Foreigners, However, Can
Get Leases for Build
ing Sites.
After the Abolition of Consular
Jurisdiction Favorable Terms
May Ba Secured.
MERCHANTS MADE BANKRUPT.
An Alarming State oi Affairs Among
tbe Business Men of Tokio
Disclosed.
TOKIO, Japan, Oct. 10.â The publica
tion of the new Japanese Civil Code ren
ders it clear that the complaints made by
Europeans and Americans about the
tenure of land under the revised treaties
are baseless. Ownership of land by aliens
has always been opposed by the Japanese
and is forbidden by the new treaties.
On the other hand, unless foreigners
should be able to obtain land for long
periods, it was not easy to see how they
could reap any advantages from the open
ing of the country after the abolition of
Consular jurisdiction, since" the building
of stores, warehouses or factories outside
the present settlements would be virtually
impossible. That leases of building sites
could be obtained was not doubted, but an
idea prevailed that the Civil Code wouia
restrict the term of leasing to thirty years,
a period plainly insufficient for the pur
poses of business men.
It is now found, however, that although
the privilege of owning land is withheld,
foreigners will be able to obtain land for
any number of years in the capacity of
"supeiliciaires." In that capacity they
will be able to purchase a right of tenure
holding good for whatever term is entered
on the face of the contract, and the right
will include absolute ownership of all
buildings, trees, or bamboos on the land.
If the term be not fixed by the parties to
the contract, the intervention of a court of
law may subsequently be invoked by the
owner should the original conditions of
tenure prove onerous to him. But that is
a secondary question. The main fact is
that after the abolition of consular juris
diction in 1899, foreigners will be able to
obtain leases of land in any and every
part of Japan for whatever term of years
they may think convenient.
An alarming state of affairs has been
disclosed among a section of Japan's busi
ness men. Several of the Toklo dealers
in cotton piece-goods had been for some
time getting their notes freely discounted
by the banks when the latter, having their
suspicions aroused by precautionary ac
tion on the part of the Bank of Japan, re
fused to discount any new bills or renew
the old. Tue result is that about eleven
commission merchants are threatened
with bankruptcy, their liabilities aggre
gating nearly 2,000,0C0 yen. There is some
apprehension of a panic, but probably a
compromise will be effected.
The new line of Japanese steamers to
Australia was opened on October 3, the
pioneer steamer being the Yamashiro
Man, belonging to the Nippon Yusen
Kaisha. The Yamashiro Marti is a fine
steamer of 2500 tons, beautifully fitted,
and affording to passengers all the com
forts of a crack Atlantic liner. Her de
parture from Yokohama was made the oc
casion of a celebration on a liberal scale.
Japanhas now lines of steamers running
to VKdivostock, Europe, America and
Australia.
From the provinces of Anhui and Hu
kuang. in China, reports have been for
warded to Peking describing the great
hardships suffered by the people on ac
count of inundations. In both cases a
waterspout is mentioned as the prime
cause of the trouble. The Emperor simply
ordered the Governor of Anhui and the
Viceroy Chang to devise means for alleviat
ing the distress and for carrying off the
surplus water. His Majesty is not particu
larly helpful, it must be confessed.
Another case of violent assatlt against
a foreigner is reported from China. It
occurred at Pootuns, near Shanghai, and
the victim docs not' seem to have given
any provocation whatever. He was as
sailed by a party of roughs and severely
handled, but managed to effect his escape,
losing only his dog, which was cruelly
killed. Several outrages of a similar na
ture have been committed in the same
district.
As an illustration of the popular admin
istration of justice in China, the ccse of a
man that stole a Tanner's wife at a place
some 1500 miles inland from Hankow is in
structive. The thief sold the woman for
ten ounces of silver, which appears to be
about the tariff in mountainous districts
of China. He was caught by the husband
of the woman, and two otiier men, who
carried him to a particular tree near a
Buddhist monastery, and strung him up
by his wiists tied behind his back so that
his body was bent forward and his toes
barely touched the ground. In that posi
tion he was hammered with a large stone
at the base of iiis spine and on his ankles.
This was by way of preliminary to carry
ing him to the magistrate's yarnen, where
he was sentenced to decapitation.
Anti-foreign feeling at Cnengtu is re
ported to be so bad that the Roman Cath
olic lathers, who have lived there for
years, no longer venture to walk in the
city, Knowing that to do so would expose
them to insult and perhaps attack.
ALL CAUSED BY KEROSENE
While Trying to Hasten a Fire
an Unfortunate Wcman
Meets Death.
Her Sick Husband and Five Children
Rescued by a Heroic Little
Girl.
CAMDEN', N. J., Oct. 25.â The hasten

shocking death of a mother and imper
iled the lives of her sick husband and five
little children this morning. Harris
Freedlander and his family occupy a little
two-story dwelling, 2(JB Sycamore street.
Freedlander has been ill with typhoid
fever and the family have been in sore
straits. When Mrs. Freedlander arose
this morning she found that her kitchen
fire had died out during the night. She
saturated some kindlings with -kerosene
and placed the can on top of the stove
and touched a matci; to the kindling.
Tho next instant there was an explosion
that shook the house, and, mingled wiih
agonized screams, it startled the sick roan
above-stairs and aroused the sleeping
children. Freedlander leaped ont of bed
and ran downstairs. Neigh bors who heard
the explosion, the screams and jTreed
lander's frantic cries sent in a call for the
firemen. Meanwhil9 the children, aroused
by the confusion, attempted to get down
stairs, but the oldest girl held them back
when she found smoke pouring up the
stairway in such volume as to almost suf
focate her. Led by the eldest girl, the
children climbed out upon a shed.
"The baby," cried some of the gathered
people, excitedly, "where is the baby?"
The older children had forgotten the
sleeping child in the confusion, but the
little heroine of the occasion, never flinch
ing, clambered back through the window,
cot the baby and brought it out in tri
umph. The little ones were easily gotten
down from the shed and cared for by the
neighbors. Responding to the alarm the
firemen reached the house and soon had
the flames in the kitchen subdued. As the
smoke cleared away the shapeless form of
the unfortunate wife and mother was
found on the floor. The flames had
charred her body into an unrecognizable
mass and she was buried before dark.

JUNEAU MINER
BURIED ALIVE
Carlton F. Wells' Horrible
Death in an Entombed
Casket.
Discovery Made by an Under
taker Sent to Exhume the
Remains.
INTERRED WHILE IN A TRANCE
The Victim Was Once a Resident
of Ca'.averas County, Cali
fornia.
PORTLAND, Or.. Oct. 25.â A horrible
tale of living inhumation comes from Ju
neau, Alaska, in a letter received by
George P. Wirtz of this city. The victim
was Carlton F. Wells, who left Southern
Oregon almost two years ago for the Arc
tic gold fields, where, after accumulating
a fortune of $20,00U, he was to all appear
ances stricken down by heart disease in
Juneau last May. Just prior to Wells' ap
parent death he forwarded the bulk of nis
little fortune to his wife, now living in
Trenton, N. J., whither he was bound
when life's cord was snapped asunder.
A little more than a month ago the
undertaker who attended to the burial of
Wells received a letter from his widow
asking that the body be exhumed and
shipped East for permanent interment.
The instructions were being complied
with when a ghastly discovery obstructed
their execution.
When thu coffin containing Wells' body
was opened the remains were found to lie
in a cramped position with the face
turned toward the side of the coffin.
Closer inspection showed beyond doubt
that Wells had awakened from a death
like trance after burial. In the right
hand, of which little more than the bones
remained, was clutched a gutta percha
plate bearing three false teeth, which in
his agony Wells must nave torn from the
roof of his mouth. Near the place where
his right jaw rested in the coffin was
found a plain gold ring which the de
ceased had worn on the fourth finger of
his right hand.
In view of this horrible discovery the
undertaker and the doctor who attended
Wells decided not to send the remains
East unless forced to do so by legal pro
cess. What excuse they have formulated
to appease the widow is not known.
Mr. Wirtz says that Wells formerly
lived in Calaveras County, Cal., and once
resided in Virginia City, I^ev. While he
was in Southern Oregon his wife sojourned
tlie greater part of the time with friends
in East Portland, where she is quite well
known.

"GOOD GOVERNMENT."
ADDRESS
OP THE
CITIZENS'
NON - PARTISAN PARTY !
âTO THE
VOTERS OF SIX FRANCISCO.
The Citizens* Non-Parlsan Party was called into
existence by a condition of affairs In the City Gov-
ernment familiar to all.
This deplorable condition continues In an aggra-
va:ed form.
It lias therefore nominated in the interest of
good government,' and irrespective of party poli-
tics, a ticket which It asks the voters in the City to
support. ' . â¢
. The return of ; the bosses . to the scenes of their
nefarious operations, the failure of justice in deal-
ing with these conspirators, and the open organi-
zation of corruptlonists. have compelled the Kon-
Partisan Party to weed out doubtful or known bad
men, and place before the voters of this city men
who are believed to be honest and honorable. â¢ ; V: â 
Each' candidate indorsed by the Non-Partisans
has signed a pledge, which is on file with the sec-
retary, to conduce the affairs of the city economi-
cally, honestly, and on j business principles,; and
embracing the following obligations: . :
Provide for the fullest enjoyment of religious
liberty;
Pubic schools to be liberally supplied and eco-
nomically managed ; v
Total tax levy not to exceed $1 on the $100 on
assessed value of $300,000,000. T :
'.â  One-twelfth Act rigidly enforced, and no ex-
penses incurred except by authority of . the Super-
visors: â 
Golden Gate Park to be Improved for the, j benefit
of the people; expense not to exceed 5 cents on the
$100. ; , > _
Streets and sewers to be improved, . superintend-
ent to be a civil engineer, and business methods
employed;
Eight hours a day's work ; home labor and ma-
terial to be preferred in all cases â 
County Clerk's office to be run within $0000 per
month; '
City and County Surveyor's fees, cost of janitor
service at City Hall, and shorthand i reporting, to â¢
be reduced; . â¢ â¢"â¢'.; '
All departments of ; City. Government to be re-
moved from partisan politics; , ". . Â 7.;
Free use of Telephone; by City: no franchise or
extensions granted without direct benefit to City.
It is the purpose of ; the Citizens' Won- Partisan
Party to see, as far as in Its power, that such T can-
didates. If elected, shall carry out their . pledge to
the letter. Â . .
Every citizen recognizes the demoralized condi-
tion of our Municipal Government; and will admit
that constant watchfulness : is necessary, to stamp
out existing abuses and prevent the growth â of
others.: , , â  â¢ â 
.Good officers need their arms strengthened
against; schemers and temptation; and " faithful
officers are entitled to " support ; while those who
fail in their duly, or yield, to the debasing Influ-
ence of the : bosses, or to the: direct- or indirect
bribes of corporations, should be made to feel the
strong arm of the law.
The Citizens' .Non-Partizan Party's aim is to se-
cure to the City of San Francisco a good govern-
ment, and ; for this ; purpose It! ' organization will
continue until its aim is accomplished.
Jt Is therefore justified in aiking the effective
and earnest support of all citizens or San Fran-
cisco, irrespective of party politics, in its efforts to
secure at the coming election good officers for tha
City of San Francisco. : â  '. -â  â

MARCHERS TREAD
UKIAH'S STREETS
Greatest Demonstration in
Mendocino County's
History.
Republicans Form a Proces
sion Nearly a Mile in
Length.
NEAR-BY TOWNS REPRESENTED
Two Large Meetings Addressed by
Major Kyle and Thomas H.
Selvaie.
CKIAH, Cal., Oct. 25.â The grandest
political demonstration ever held in this
county was that of last night under the
auspices of the Ukiah McKiniey and
Hobart Club and the Republican County
Central Committee. Early in the day a
large number of people began coming to
town from all points in this vicinity and
before evening the streets were crowded
as they never had been before.
The Ukiah McKiniey Club, numbering
130 men, formed in line at 7 o'clock and
marched to the railroad depot, the proces
sion being headed by the Ukiah Silver
Cornet Band. Immediately upon the ar
rival of the train the Republican clubs
from Petaluma, Santa Rosa, Healdsburg
and Cloverdale, headed by their respective
bands and the Hopland, Geyserviile and
Beoastopol clubs.escorted by the Sotoyome
Band, were formed into line by Grand
Marshal W. H. Chessail and the march
was oegun. The procession was headed by
aids Sheriff J. R. Johnson and Colonel
W. H. Milier who cleared the way for the
parade. It is estimated that there were 1200
voters in line. Orders had been civen that
no cheering or other demonstrations pro
ceed from those in line and this order was
obeyed to the letter. Taken altogether
this was the most orderly and well be
haved body of men ever congregated at
this place for any purpose.
The procession marched along the prin
cipal streets of the town to the hall. It
was almost a mile in length, two men
marching abreast. Company A, High
8c 00l Cadets, headed by Captain Jennie
McMillan and Sergeant Marie Hatch,
acted as escort to the speakers' carriage.
Colored lights were set off along the line
of march and fireworks were exploded by
those in the procession. Numerous bon
fires had been lighted along the route.
The hall in which the speakers held
forth was crowded, and hundreds were
turned away. It had been tastily deco
rated by the ladies of Ukiah. On the
stage was a magnificent life-size litho
graph ot Major William McKiniey deco
rated with Sowers.
The chairman introduced Hon. Thomas
H. Selvage, who made a short speech on
the issues of the day. Then Major C. W.
Kyle was introduced, and for mlly two
hours held the strict attention of the
audience. Ho explained that there never
had been an exact parity between Ameri
can gold and silver coins. Congress first
established the ratio of 15 to 1, and found
that it had undervalued the gold dollar,
and when it was changed to 16 to 1 it un
dervalued the silver dollar. The speaker
was opposed to fiat money, and said that
the laws of Congress could not override or
control the law of supply ana demand in
fixing the value of money. He dwelt upon
the fact that Congress, to keep the silver
money in this country, had caused the
halves, quarters and dimes to be coined at
a depreciated rate.
Kyle explained that silver had in reality
not been demonetized in 1873; that for
eighty-one years prior to that time 8,000,000
standard dollars had been coined, while
in twenty-one years since 1573 over 4u0,
--000,000 standard silver dollars had been
coined. He asked the free silver men in
the audience why it was that the standard
dollars which now remain in the treasury
were not put into circulation. One vault
in Washington twenty fi-et high, fifty-four
feet wide and eighty feet deep was filled
with standard silver dollars. It was not
more silver we wanted, he declared, but
employment for the workingmen to give
them an opportunity to earn the money
now in circulation. In closing he quoted
Major McKinley's words:
"It is better that we open our mills to
American workmen than to open our
mints to the silver of the world."
An overflow meeting was held at the
Courthouse park. It was presided over by
Hon. G. A. Sturtevant and addressed by
Hon. Thomas H. Seivaue.
ORANGE SILVER RALLY.
United States Supreme Court Attacked
by a Democratic O-ator.
ORANGE, Cal.. Oct. 25.- 0. I. Clark of
Vila Park and W. P. Northcross of Orange
addressed a silver meeting at this place
last evening. During his remarks the
latter gentleman said:
"Let us see whether there is room for
criticism of the United States Supreme
Court. This tribunal is not infallible, nor
can it be considered august as the term is
now applied to it. In deciding political
matters the Justices have almost always
shown partisan bias. In the trial of the
election of Samuel J. Tilden the five
Justices who sat upon the Electoral Com
mission divided upon party lines and
voted for a decision just as they had
voted at the polls. After the Dred Scott
decision was rendered fourteen Northern
States passed laws practically nullifying
the action of the Supreme Court, and
during Lincoln's administration, without
reversal by the court, the decision was
utterly disregarded."
WALNUI GROVE DEMONSTRATION
Judge Hunt of Alameda lalks to Farm
ers and Orchnrdists.
WALNUT GROVE, Cal., Oct. 25.â A
grand Republican meeting was addressed
at Walnut Grove Hall Friday night by
Judge A. B. Hunt of Alameda. For an
hour and a half he discussed in an able
and eloquent manner the subject, of the
coinage of silver and the doctrine of pro
tection. His audience was composed
largely of fruit-growers and farmers and
was enthusiastic in the extreme, frequent
ly interrupting the speaker with hearty
applause. At the close of the meeting
three rousing cheers were given for Mc-
K-.nley, Hobart and protection. After the
meeting persons who had intended to vote
for silver announced their intention of
voting for McKiniey.

LOS ANGELES DECISION.
Rights of Dealers in Oleomargarine De
fined in a Ruling by Justice
Owens.
LOS ANGELES, Cal,, Oct. 25.â A de
cision of interest to provision dealers of
California was rendered by Justice Owens
of this city yesterday after long and care
ful deliberation. The action was against
John Moriarity, a Main - street grocer.
Tnis gentleman was complained against
upon two charges, the first of which al
leged that he sold a certain product made
partly out of fat, oil and oleaginous sub
stance and compounds thereof not pro
duced from unadulterated milk or cream â
the product beinj, in plain English, oleo
margarine. The action was brought unuer
the provisions of section 2 of chapter
XXXVIII of the laws of 1895, entitled
"An act to prevent deception in the man
ufacture and sale of butter and of cheese."
The court said:
The defendant insists that- the statute is
void upon the ground that it is in conflict
with the act of Congress adopted August 2,
188G, providing for the manufacture of
oleomargarine, and is fÂ»n attempt to interfere
with interstate commerce. I tnink that this
statute is valid, not being prohibitory and
not in conflict with said act of Congress; but
I have also arrived at the conclusion that the
defendant in this case has not violated the
provisions of said statute and consequently
is not guilty.
The second complaint was based on sec
tion 3 of the act, which provides that the
manufacturer "shall prepare a statement
printed in plain Roman type stating in
the English language its name and the
name and address of the manufacturer,
the name of tne place where manufactured
or put up, and also the names and actual
percentages of the various ingredients used
Drawn From the Artist's Plans of the New Tourist Hotel to Be Erected on Adams Street, Los Angeles*
in the manufacture of such imitation but
ter."
It was conceded that the information
specified was delivered to the purchsaer
pasted upon the tub containing imitation
butter. Tbe defendant did not furnish a
loose copy of the statement to the pur
chaser, and for this reason the people de
manded bia conviction, and claimed that
he was guilty of violating the provision of
the act. The court holds that pasted no
tices upon tubs, firkins, boxes or other
packages are sufficient, and concludes:
Therefore a verdict of not guilty will be en
tered in each of these cases, and the defend
ant discharged.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, OCTOBER 26, 1896.
EIGHT NEEDS OF
LOS ANGELES
Citizens Lend a Hand for
the Improvement of
the City.
Successes of the Past Will Be
Outdone Through Tbeir
Efforts.
NEW VENTURES IN PROSPECT.
Include a Deep-Sea Harbor, Salt Lake
Railway and Tourist
Hotel.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Oct. 24.â Los An
geles is rich, not only in successes already
achieved, but in future possibilities within
easy reach.
She is now a city of 100,000 inhabitants
and is the metropolis of a region, abun-
The Southern Pacific Company's Principal Depot at Los Angeles,
dant in but partially developed resources,
containing an area of 200,000 square miles
and a population approaching 300,000.
Los Angeles has sprung into this envi
able prominence within the last score of
years by reason of her natural advantages
â climate, topography, productive lands
and rich resourcesâ and also, what was
equally essential, by the energy and en
terprise of her citizens who have intelli
! gently turned these natural advantages to
the best account.
They publish our climatic attractions to
the wond and bring 30,000 tourists here
every winter. Many of these find South
ern California a good enough Paradise
ior them, and they remain perman
ent citizens, and invest their capital
and engage in business enterprises. They
have the courage of their convictions
and erect costly buildings on our business
streets, or adorn the residence sections i
with sumptuous dwellings and homelike I
cottages, ar.d the advent of the succeeding
tourist season finds all these structures
permanently occupied.
If perchance a lull occurs in business
activities or building industries, the rest
less energy of her citizens sets the surplus
labor to work pavng miles of streets and
sidewalks as in 1889; or constructing long
lines of electric railway as in 1891; or bor- j
ing hundreds of oil wells as in 1894; or j
building needed sshoolhouses and beau-j
tifying parks as in the present year.
Let us enumerate some of the many
things Los Angeles needs, must have, and
surely will have in the near future. They
are not mentioned in the order of their
prominence, nor of their anticipated effect
upon the growth and development of this
city.
First â A deep-sea harbor. Los Angeles
has three ports, namely: Santa Monica,
18 miles west; Redondo, 20 miles south
west, and San Pedro, 22 miles south, each
connected with the city by two lines of
j competing railway and traversing a level,
I fertile, beautiful farming country. A less
expenditure than the Government has
lavished on the Oakland water front or in
the shallow waters of Humboldt Bay, or j
along the river approaches to Portland,
will give a serviceable haroor at one or j
these Los Angeles ports, which will accom
modate the vast commerce of Asia, the
East Indies and the South American
coast.
At the last session of Congress the sum
of $2,800,000 was appropriated for the im
provement of one of ihese harbors, the
selection to be determined by a board of
engineers. When the selection is made
there will bean expenditure of abont half
a million a year, and the improvement
will help keep the money circulating in
this vicinity. But the construction of the
harbor will lead to a far more important
result. It will greatly stimulate our
ocean commerce, and by finding new
markets for our Southern California
products increase their value.
Secondâ A. Japan steamship line. The
shortest railway haul from the Pacific
Ocean to the heart of the Mississippi
Valley is by lines beginning on our south
ern coast, and passing over the easy
grades and low divides of the Santa Fe
and Southern Pacific railroad systems.
Los Angeles and her sister city of
San Diego are equally anxious to
have the new trans-Pacific steamship line
from Japan terminate for the present at
that port. Tea, rice, spices, cement, sul
phur, curios, etc., will be shipped east
ward, and flour, cotton, beans, fruits, iron
ore, etc., will constitute return freight.
As the commercial intercourse between
these two great populous countries be
comes more intimate their exchange of
products will necessarily increase, and
Southern California, ana consequently Its
metropolis, Los Angeles, will be greatly
benefited by the establishment of the pro
posed steamship line.
Thirdâ A steamship line to the southern
coast. When we import our coffees, dye
woods, mahogany, fertilizers and numer
ous articles which come from the west
coast of South America, it is to be pre
sumed that the cargoes are landed at one
of our Southern California ports, and
when we send our fruits, nuts, sugar,
beans, flour and various other products
and manufactures to tbe Pacific coast
of the countries named, they should
naturally be shipped from the same ports.
The presumption would certainly be
based on common-sense, but unfor
tunately it is not the fact. Under
present conditions an invoice of coffee
billed by a merchant of Costa Rica to a
Los Angeles importer will proceed past us
up the California coast to a city 400 miles
by water north of this latitude and
then be brought 500 miles by rail Â»outh
to this city, making an absurd detour of
900 miles, and adding needless expense
and consuming valuable time. On the
other hand, our goods destined for those
southern countries must likewise be
shipped over the northern loop via San
Francisco.
It requires no prophetic skill to predict
that this preposterous state of things can
not and will not continue long to exist
unless the city of Los Angeles has lost the
spirit and enterprise which has charac
terized its history in the past.
Fourthâ A tourist hotel. Central Cali
fornia has a magnificent tourist hotel,
with ideal surroundings, at Del Monte,
and Southern Cahlornia has one equally
unique on Coronado Beach. Both serve
well the purposes for which they were
planned. But Los Angeles needs within
its city limits or closely adjacent thereto
a tourist home different from either of
those mentioned. It should a s ghtly
location, be surrounded with beautiful
grounds, and its Moorish arches, support-
ing broad verandas, would admit the
genial sunshine in the mild winters or
afford welcome shade in cool and breezy
summers.
This Los Angele3 tourist hotel will be
luxurious in its furnishings, appoint
ments and seivice. A Vanderbilt, a
Rockefeller, an English lord, a German
baron or a Russian noble should find here
an appropriate and delightful resting
place lor a few days, a month, or an entire
season. The financial advantages of such
patronage would not be limited to the
payment of the hotel bill by the wealthy
guest and his traveling party; their pres
ence would attract others and make the
resort a fad. But the consequences would
be still more lasting. When Mr. Flagler
of the Standard Oil Syndicate visited a
Florida winter resort some years ago he
took a fancy to the town and he and his
friends subsequently invested millions of ,
capital in that locality.
Fifth â A system of boulevards. Los An
; peles Jacks first-class out-of-town drive
| ways. A boulevard to the seashore at
| Santa Monica, eighteen miles distant,
will soon be under way, if the strong
committee of the Merchants' and Manu
facturers' Association, who are identified
with Che inception of the enterprise, can
materialize their plans. The proposed
avenue will be 120 feet wide, shaded with
two rows of tr es on each bonier, have a
cycle path, besprinkled in summer and be
! kept smooth and in perfect order at all
! seasons.
It will be a charming drive for the win
! ter tourist as he speeds from the City of
Angels to the occidental seaâ the Cahu
enga Mountains on bis right, the genial
sun low in the southern heavens, the ver
dant fields on either hand, and the blue
rim of the Pacific in front. Who can
doubt that this noble avenue will ulti
mately be lined with elegant suburban
villas? How many tourists will silently
resolve, "I will have a winter home in ihU
beautiful land."
Sixthâ A popular educational institute.
This will be an imposing structure, strik
ing in its architectural features, and will
become the home of art, science, music,
literature and education. Our Public
Library and Board of Education are occu
pyine cramped quarters in the City Hall,
which are needed by other departments of
the City government. They should be
provided with enlarged accommodations
lor present and future needs in the pew
buiidine. There is a pronounced artistic
element in this community. A school of
desien and a series ot art galleries for
drawings, paintings and statuary would
meet a popular demand. The Historical
Society would here lind a congenial home.
A scientific museum, embracing the
various departments of mineralogy, bot
any, zcology, ethnology, archaeology, etc.,
would soou be enriched by private collec
tions now stored away from the public
s:azc in boxes and closets.
This institute would not only be an edu
cational factor of great value to our own
people, but its halls would be thronged by
visitors from a distance, and the varied
attractions presented would prove unfail
ing sources of interest to temporarily resi
dent tourists, whose abundant leisure
would thus be pleasantly and usefuily oc
cupied.
Seventhâ Smelting works for precious
metals. \Ve are in the midst of one of the
richest mineral regions on the globe.
Gold, silver, copper and lead are found in
inexhaustible quantities. Magnificent
lodes of gold-bearing quartz stand out like
reefs on our mountain sides ana penetrate
to unknown depths.
Other valuable minerals exi-t in every
range from the flunks of the Sierras in
Kern County to the extremity of Lower
California, and from the aurilerous sands
of the seashore to the picturesque buttes
o: New Mexico. But we have no works in
which to smelt the ores or to sample them
on any large scale. Those of surpassing
ric hness are shipped hundreds and thou
sands of miles to Denver or Omaha or San
Francisco.
A smelting furnace here would be sup
plied daily with trainloads of ore of a
lower grade than can be profitably shipped
to the distant points named, and would
give employment to many idie hands, and
at the same time encourage a more thor
ough development of our hidden stores of
mineral wealth.
Eighthâ A railway to Salt Lake City.
Doubtless the thoughtful reader has been
anticipating mention of this eighth need
from the beginning of this article. It is,
indeed, the most important project now
encaging the attention of Los Angeles,
and would undoubtedly hasten the ac
complishment of all the other enter
prises contemplated. The proposed road
would give us a third competing trans
continental railway. The advent of the
Southern Pacific doubled our population,
the Santa Fe a decade later doubled it
again, and it is safe to predict that the
Salt Lake road would double it a third
time.
In the first place it would reduce the
distance to Chicago and the Northwest
from 200 to 300 miles, shorten the time
from 12 to 18 hours and thus lessen the
cost of passenger and freight traffic, all of
which must stimulate travel and business.
In the next place it would open up a new
territory of 150,0001 prosperous people to
our merchants and manufacturers and to
the fruit growers of all Southern Cali
fornia. Finally it would traverse a region
of untold mineral wealth and enormously
stimulate our mining industries. Gold,
silver, copper, lead, borax, gypsum, salt
and nitrates abound.
Besides the precious and useful minerals
named, there are great bodies of iron and
coal of the best quality in Southwestern
Utah, less than 300 miles from our present
railway systems. These would insure a
permanent supply of cheap fuel, steel rails
at low cost, anl low-priced iron for build
ings, machinery and various manufac
turing purpose*. Wm. H. Knight,
Secretary Merchants' and Manufac
turers' Association.
COLUMBIA RIVER PLACERS.
Mining Prosecuted on an Extensive Scale
Along the Streams in Wash
ington.
TACOMA, Wash., Oct. 25.â Placer
mining is being prosecuted on a large
scale on the banks of the Columbia River
in Eastern Washington. Last week earth
running 25 cents per pan was found on
the Last Chance claim in the Big Bend
district. The owners have driven a tun
nel through solid rock for 262 feet to
strike an old channel which was partially
worked during the Big Bend excitement
several years ago. A 750-foot tunnel has
been run on the North Star claim, a half
mile away, revealing dirt which pays four
men $50 daily.
Nearly as good results have been ob
tained on many other claims and work
will be continued all winter. Most of
these claims are owned by Eastern Wash
ington men. In several instances farmers
have secured good claims above Wenat
chee. and up toward the British line sev
eral Chinese have been extracting gold
from river sands for years ana are now
wealthy.
Companies are being formed to pur
chase dredgers and engage in placer
mining on a mammoth scale. The dredg
ers can pump sand from beneath deep
water where gold is supposed to be most
plentiful.

HE IS NOT INSANE.
Max Pauly, an Inventor And Instru
ment Maker, Locked Up in the
Receiving hospital.
Max Pauly, an inventor and instrument
maker, living at 651 Stevenson street, was
arrested Saturday night and taken to the
Receivine Hospital to await his examina
tion before the Insanity Commissioners
this morning.
Pauly declared yesterday that his ar
rest was an outrage, as he was perfectly
sane and the doctors at the hospital
agreed with him.
The complaining witness against Pauly
is Martin Calsiiig, a machinist, who lives
in the same house as Pauly, and the latter
could not understand why Calsing, who
was an old friend, suould swear to such a
complaint against him.
"I used to be in business for myself,"
said Pauly yesterday, "but have recently
been employed by A. J. McNicoll & Co.,
the elevator men. I had made up my mind
to start for myself again and asked Cals
inc to help me with my instruments and
J would pay him for It. He put it off till
finally I told him I did not want him.
Then commenced a series of petty an
noyances. My eyeglasses were broken;
my alarm clock was tampered with and
my trunk damaged. I spoke to Mrs.
Dayi, the landlady, about it, but she said
she knew nothing and I believed her.
"Last Friday night when I found that
my trunk had been tampered with I
opened my door and .spoke so that I could
be hearc. I was angry and said that if
any of my things were tampered with
again I would have somebody arrested. I
intended leaving the house to save myself
further annoyance, but to my surprise I
was arrested last night for being insane."
Beaten Into Insensibility.
Michael Lynch, a teamster living at 901
Battery street, was carried to the Receiving
Hospital last night suffering from several
scalp wounds and other bruises on the head
ana shoulders. He claims that, at the coiner
of Vallejo and Sansome streets, a gang of un
known men accosied him, and then, without
any provocation whatever, beat him iuto in
sensibility. He was found by Officer Walsh
and taken to toe hospital, when his injuries
were dressed.
Spiritual Mid Bodily Health.
kcv. vr. v. a. spaiding delivered an inter
esting sermon in St. John the Evangelist
Church on Fifteenth street lust evening. He
took for his text the words of St. Paul to the
Ephesian Christians, in which he bids them
'â¢Be stroug in ihe Lord and the power of his
might." In his discourse Dr. Spalditig spoke
of the blessing of bodily strength, but he said
that spiritual health is of fsr more importance
fur it reaches into eternity. People are apt to
ignore this fact and strive ior things merely
earthly. â

LOOTING MAILS
IN NEW MEXICO
Lincoln County's Series of
Recent Stage-Coach
Robberies.
Four Hold-Ups in a Single Spot
on the Road Near San
Antonio.
BULLION SAVED BY A DRIVER.
Deceives the Bandits and Preserves
the Treasureâ Posses on
the Trail.
ALBUQUERQUE, N. Mex., Oct. 25.â
Full details of the two stage robberies in
Lincoln County Wednesday night were
brought to Albuquerque to-day by the
searching party sent out to hunt for the
coaches when they did not arrive at their
destinations on time. Both stages, one
bound for San Antonio from White Oaks
and the other to W >ite Oaks from San
Antonio, were stopped at a point twenty
six miles west of White Oaks. The drivers
recognized the robbers as members of the
gang that robbed the stages on the same
route two weeks ago. The amount of the
loot they got Wednesday night, is not
known.
The bandits, numbering three, halted
the westbound stage first and then waited
for the eastbound coach, robbing it at tbe
same spot. They cut open the mail sacks,
taking the letters of value, and took two
horses from each stage. A box contain'
ing $2100 in silver bullion on one of the
coach-s was not taken, as the driver, when
asked by one of the robbers what was in
the box, gave it a kick and said it co 3
tamed a clock.
A posse of seven men started from San
Antonio after the robbers, following the
trail on tho west side of tbe Oscura
Mountains, going southward. Deputy
United States Marshal Fowler left. San
Antonio yesterday morn.ng with a posse.
Postoffice Inspector Fredericks, who has
been in Lincoln County ever since the
hold-up two weeks ago, is also on the
ground.
The robbers told the drivers that they
secured about $800 from the hold-ups two
weeks ago. Alter taking the hordes from
both stages they had one more than they
needed, and they shot it so that the stage
men would have no means of getting to
the station except on foot, thus consum
ing more time and giving the robbers a
better start. This band is the one t at at
tempted to rob a Santa Fe overland train
several weeks ago, when its leader was
kiJled. It includes upward of a score of
bolder desperadoes.
Stockton Wins at Baseball.
STOCKTON, Cal., Oct. 25. â Stockton
won the baseball game from the San Fian

visitors did not seem to be able to connect
with Balz and were able to knock out only
five base hits, getting one run, not earned,
on these. For Stockton Lock head played
a great game at short, taking a hard drive
with one hand. Sweeney, at first, also
played a star game, and won his share of
applause. George Harper of the Brooklyn
team acted as umpire, and his decisions
were uniformly satisfactory. Josh Reilly
of the Chicagos played third base for
Stockton to day, and knocked out the only
three-bagger made during the game the
first time up. The runs by innings were:

local grounds this season took place yes
terday at Alameda, the contestants being
the Pacifies and the Placer County eleven.
While the visitors showed excellent form,
both with the bat and in the field, their
want of practice made them comparatively
easy game for the home team, who came
out winners by 48 runs.
Captain Theobald, winning the toss, put
his men in. : Myers, who headed the order,
was nut dismissed till be had compi'ed a
stocky 42. Later on Wiseman put uo
three dozen in his usual free ; style, the
rest of the team doing little scoring.
The visitors, too, led off well. A. H.
Jackson playine an inning of 20 in ex
cellent form. Lannow also did good work
for the team, but the combined efforts
failea to bring up the score to much over
halt that of the home eleven.
The Pacifies started a second inning
and made 50 " for six wickets. This, of
course, had no effect on the result. The
fielding of the Pacifies was exceptionally
good. The score:

GATHER IN FORCE
Grand Rally of District
Numher Two, League
of the Cross.
Ambitious Young Temperance
Advocates Tell "What
Drunkenness Costs."
WON BY ST. JOSEPH'i PARISH.
The Committee Awards the Much-
Coveted Silver M.dal to Charles
L. Asmussen.
The regular quarterly rally of District
No. 2 League of the Cross was held at
Court Missiun Parlor, Seventeenth street,
yesterday afternoon. The parishes of St.
Cnarles, Mission Dolores and St. Joseph
more than tilled the large auditorium,
many being compelled to stand through
out tlie long but thoroughly interesting
programme. The cadet companies present
were B of St. Charles Parish, James
Curley commanding, and L, Mission
Dolores, William C. Clarke in charge.
The special feature of tue day was the
essay contest, the subject being, "What
Drunkenness Costs." The participants
were Captain Dowling of Company B, Pri
vate Joseph Maher of Company L and
Charles JL. Asmussen of St. Joseph's Jun
ior Branch of the League. Colonel J. J.
Tobin, Miss Donnelly, vice-principal of
the Hearst Grammar School, and Brother
Lascia:i, director of bt. Peter's School,
ncted as judges for tbe occasion. It was
conditioned that each essay should be lim
ited to 1000 words, though the ambitious
young advocates of temperance were not
blow to exceed this number.
Private Maher was the first speaker, and
his efforts met with generous applause.
He confined himself largely to statistics,
though touching lightiyhere and there on
the moral and social evils which, he
claimed followed the too free use of
alcofioi. Captain Dowling of Company B
followed with a very well-timed essay,
which, while not materially differing in
Bubstance from the facts presented by the
first speaker, was delivered with great
earnestness and some pretense at oratory.
St. Joseph's Parish bad no reason to feel
ashamea of its representative, Charles L.
Asmussen. His essay was short, crisp,
direct to the point, and was well received
by the audience.
Pending the decision of the judges,
David I. Mahoney delivered an address, in
tne course of which he said:
"As far as instruction upon the question
of temperance goes, I think the subject
has been fully covered in the splendid es
says we have listened to this afternoon.
\ou know the special work of the League
of the Cross is to take in as members
youths ranging from 5 to 14. At "hat age
they are more easily taught the benefits of
temperance. They are surrounded by an
atmosphere of purity which must be bene
ficial in its results. T it is to our interest, |
the interest of America, to have good citi
zens, because that means good govern
ment. This country more than any other
needs pure-minded and sober citzens at
its head. That is one reason why an or
ganization of this kind is to be desired
and why it should be fostered by the peo
ple at large."
Captain Tobin then announced that the
committee nad awarded the medal to
Charles L. Asmussen of St. Josepn's parish.
He said that for number of arguments
Private Maher had excelled, while Captain
Dowling : s delivery had be'en most effective
and intelligent, but for general excellence,
inciudins oratory and arguments, the com
mittee was unanimous in awarding tbe
prize to tne representative of St. Joseph's
parish.
It is worthy of mention that this is the
first instance when other than a cadet has
won the coveted honor.
Lincoln Club.
The weekly meeting of the Lincoln Re
publican Club was held on Saturday at 103
Ninth street, R. W. McCann presiding. A
large attendance was present and sixty
two new members signed the roll. The
cuair announced that the drill and uni
formed corps now numbered seventy-five
and that they would turn out in the grand
Republican parade next Saturday night,
which statement was received with en
thusiasm.
John H. Harney, in behalf of George W.
Elder, candidate for Superintendent of
Streets, made a spirited address in favor
of Mr. Elder, in tbe course of which he
pointed out the great benefitdone the peo
ple by Mr. Elder as expert of the Street
Committee; the ma:iy streets, sewers and
pavements he condemned and caused to
De relaid in a proper manner; tbe expos
ure of the Army-street job; the unearth
ing of the Twelfth-street bituminous steal
and other reckless work, whereby Mr.
Elder saved the tax-payers the enormous
sum of $2-96,480 in two years. In conclud
ing the speaker strongly urged all present
to stick to the regular ticket and not be
misled by any siileshovr.
C. H. VVetjen, W. A. Deane and numer
ous others made remarks, after whicn the
club adjourned with enthusiastic cheers
for the Republican ticket.

BRYAN'S FRIENDS
TO CLAIM 50,000
Estimate of a Hoped- For
Majority in This
State.
Settled by the Democratic State
Campaign Commit
tee.
BUT THE PEOPLE WILL DECIDE
Politicians Who Are to Find That
They Are Reckoning Without
Their Host.
A quiet and orderly meeting of the
Democratic State Committee was held at
the California Hotel on Saturday, at which
j the most important business transacted !
\ | was the levying and attempted collection
of a $30 assessment ou each member of
! the committee.
After the financial matter was finally
[ disposed of by payment, or promise to pay,
i tlie next thing to be considered was what
! figure ought to be fixed on as the proper
s I claim for Bryan's prospective majority in
1 i California, not reflecting on theiact that
j the people have something to say about
! the actual outcome and that their deci
j sion will surely overturn the committee's
best guesses.
It was admitted on all hands that the
i campaign ought not to be allowed to run
I its allotted course without some claim
being made that Bryan will carry tbe
State, and it was also admitted that care
ful judgment ought to be exercised in
setting the figure, so that it would be able
to withstand the assaults which the oppo
sition would be sure to hurl aeainst it.
John W. Mitchell, fresh from the orange
! ; groves of Los Angeles, told with subdued
} enthusiasm how he had helped to convert
! one of his neighbors from a Populist Me-
Kinleyite to a Populist Bryanite. He also |
reported that a lot of silver mugwumps I
have come out for Bryan as boldly as tney
ever come out for anything or anybody,
I though they greatly "deprecate offensive
â¢ partisanship at all times.
Being pressed for his estimate of the j
I Bryan majority he thought that 50,000 !
| wouid be aoout riglit.
Tins appeared to set tbe Keynote, and i
| there was a general assent to this sugges- {
i tion. Those who were willing to set the j
j figure at 50,000 majority were Chairman
! vV. H. Alford, H. iJusenbery of Livermore,
J. W. Corcoran of San Rafael, John N.
; Woods, James Denman, Colonel W. P.
! Sullivan, Gavan McNab and Isadore Alex
ander.
Others joined in tnis estimate with
more or less cheerfulness. The argument
was mado that though this must, be ad
mitted to be a high number to fix on as a
i majority in a State like California, vet it
would not be safe to put it at less, for
fear tbe statisticians on the other side
might get in their work and figure it out
of sight.
Therefore, when a man is heard claim
ing that California is safe for Bryan by at
least 50,000 majority, by that token it may
I be known that he has received his instruc-
I tions from the Democratic State Cam
i paign Committee, if he sticks to it ne
may turn out to be a member pf that
committee who has paid his assessment.
H. W. Patton of Los Angeles was given
a great deal of praise in a resolution
which contained four whereases and cov
ered two pages of typoscript. It was set
forth that Mr. Patton and C. A. Barlow
met in a deadlock in the fusion Congres
sional convention, and that Mr. Patton,
seeing that the deadlock could not be
broken and that he could not get the nom
ination under any circumstances, gener
ously and patriotically withdrew in favor
of a third person, who was nominated
amid great applause. Therefore, "Mr. Pat
ton is entitled to the gratitude of the Dem
ocratic State Campaign Committee for
patriotism and fealty to party.
This weighty matter being disposed of,
the members of the committee swapped
yarns about the campaign in their several
districts and finally adjourned, subject to
the call of the chairman.

FACTS FOR TAXPAYERS,
A Commentary on ths Proposed
New Charter by J. Rich
ard Freud.
He Argues to Show the Financial
Benefits to Be Derived From
the Instrument
â .4 â  â 
The following document descanting on
the benefit of the proposed new charter
ha* just been issued by the Citizens' Char
ter Association : â  -
During the past forty years under the pres
ent consolidation act governing San Francisco
the City Government has expended $125,000,
--000. ' During that period $34,000,000 has been
scent upon the streets and sewers of this City.
Tne expenditures of the City Government for
me fiscal year ending June 30, 1896, amounted
to $6,577,248 45. The appropriations of the
City Government planned for the present lis
cal year will reach nearly $7,000,000. This
is $2,000,000 more than it costs to conduct
and maintain tne Government ot the State of
California lor the same period..
What is the cause of this disastrous failure
ot one of the vital functions of our City Gov
ernment? To any one who will study the
method", of finance and revenue provided la
the consolidation act now governing San Fran
cisco the answer will readily and clearly ap- I
pear. Instead of protecting the: taxpayers of
tho City the present instrument of govern
ment affords every facility for robbing the
people. . . '- â â ' â  â¢
The present consolidation act allows a tax
for ordinary municipal purposes of $2 35 and
the limn may be stretched as hiih as $3 on
the $100 valuation. Exorbitant as was the
$1 56^' rate last year, it is ' only a lecler of
what me tax-eaters may accomplish under the
present misgovcrnment of the City. This Is a
serious defect In the financial system of the
municipal government. There, is, however,
another defect of still greater magnitude.
The consolidation act provides for a general |
fund and permits the Board of Supervisors to
order demands lor one purpose to lie paid out
of the moneys raised for an entirely different
purpose." The result is that most demands are \
paid promiscuously out of the general fund,
and a deficit often appears at the end of the
fiscal year. This diversion and perversion of
the City's funds lead to confusion and irre
sponsibility. : \ ..:..- .<j â ..â '- .... .
.: Taese plain facts, taken from. the. financial
record and laws now governing this munici
pality, emphasizes most strongly the necessity
of the new charter. What are tba two salient
features of the article on finance and revenue
in the new charter that will prove a complete
protection to the tax-payers of this City?
â¢ : First, the 1 new charter positively limits the
City tax to $1 07 on the $100 of the Assessor's
valuation. Had that provision existed during
me â  last fiscal â  year, tax-payers of . an
Francisco would have saved $1,532,300. Dur
ing the present fiscal year it would have saved
the City $305,000. ; ; That provision; alone in 1
the new charter, therefore, would save the
people of Sau Francisco in two years
$1,807,300. 'â¢: â¢; ; -/..: .-â  '..'.-: .
Second, the new charter will abolish totally
the iniquitous general fund and establish in
stead twenty-four specific funds. E-ich of these
twenty-four fuuds is kept separate and dis
tinct. All revenue is divided and assigned to j
one of these specific funds. No money can be I
transferred from one fund* to another, and, I
therefore, there can be no diversion of funds >
v Among all the -objections that hay* been
raised to the new charter not a single one has
been made against any f part of the article on
finance and revenue. The present pernicious
system of finance Is not only a burden to the.
tax-payers, but is a calamity, to the entire
City. , It discourages enterprise end improve
ment and thus curtails opportunities for
labor. The workingmaD is interested In low'
taxes as much as the capitalist. The new
charter will relieve the people of this commun- '
ity of unnecessary burdens, ft will awaken
and nourish a spirit' of ; progress and prosper
ity, â¢; and .- should, therefore, have \ the hearty
suppi rt and vote of every intelligent citizen In
the community, .--i ,. Â J. Richard Freud..- >'

SHOT THROUGH
LIGHT AND SHADE
Good and Bad Scores Made
on the Shell Mound
Range.
Several of the Columbia Club
Taking to the Military
Musket
LITTLE BIFLES KEPT BUSY.
William Glindemann Carries off the
Norddeutschers' Pretty Cham
pionship Medal.
Sunshine and dona's, bright light and
shadows, together with varying winds,
were the elements that the riflemen at the
Shell Mound rifle range had to contend
with yesterday. However, several made
good scores, and those who did not made
the light and wind responsible for the bad
recoras. The Columbia Pistol and Rifle
Club kept the markers on four targets
busy all day, and nearly all of the matches
being re-entry contests the pistol and
nfle shooters kept banging away until
they had something to show for their con
sumption of ammunition.
The fact that several in this organiza
tion are expecting a challenge from some
other organization has caused a number
of Golumbias to make special efforts with
the military musket, as this is one of the
firearms that many would be behind in
an all-round match. While doing so they
are also making special efforts to secure
the Glindemann military rifle medal. J.
E. Gorman made his first trial with the
musket yesterday, and in two 10-shot
strings ran up 44 and 45 points, military
count. F. H. Bushneil has good reasons
for believing that he can shoot the mili
tary arm, making 45, 46 and 48 points.
The cash prizes on flays (inch centers)
were valuable this month, being worth
over $6 each. F. O. Young was so fortu
nate us to have two and Adolph Strecker
one.
The competition with the 22-caliber rifli
in the fifty-yard range is also spirited. Ji.
Jacobson and Ed. Hovey are in the lead
for the men's medal and Mrs. L. J. Crane
for the ladies' medal. Yesterday Mrs.
Crane Drought x>ut three flags in succes
sion for inch centers and scored nine.
The scores on both ranges were as follows:
Rifle, 200 yards, Unfred diamond medal,
three shots, re-entry â W. Glindemann 11, Dr.
L. O. Rodgers 12, F. O. Youug 13, D. VV. Mc-
Laughlin 15.

All-comers, revolver trophy, six shots â J. E.
Gorman, 41, 47, 48; H. J. WicKer, G6.
Glindemann ladies' tropny, ten shots, 22
--caliber rifle. Mrs. C. F. Waitham, 51: Mrs.
L J. Crane 32, withdrawn; Mrs. M. J. Waits
36, withdrawn.
There was a lively comoetition in the
Norddeutscher Schuetzen CluD for the
class medals. W. Glindemann was the
successful shot in the champion class, and
he becomes the permanent owner of tnat
medal. The scores were as follows:
Champion class, W. Glindemann 420 rings;
first class, not filled ; second class, A. Hage
dorn362; third class, D. Schnikel3sÃ; fourth
class, Ed Stehu 302; best first shot, D. Schuikel,

WOOL BEING HELD.
Waiting: for BlcKinley's Election
and for Better Prices.
San Francico, Oct. 24, 1896.
The market this week has been somewhat
quieter on account of the withdrawal of a good
many wools from the market until after the
election, and the same state of affairs exists in
the Eastern markets. Wools are held firmly at
! last week's quotations. The arrivals of Oregon
wools amount to about 2000 bales. The scour
ing mills are all actively employed. A good
many fall wools are being held in the country
until after the eleCiion.
It seems that the Democratic party aro still
rehashing the same stories about free wool,
the same as they did four years ago, claiming
that our mills cannot run on domestic wools
alone and must have foreign wools to mix
with, which is all bosh, as we raise as good
wool in the United States as any other country
in the world.
There has not been a year under protection
of wool that we imported to the u tract
50,000,000 pounds of foreign wool which
was used by the woolen-mills. Of
course wools, or so-called" carpet" wools,
which we do not raise in this coud
try to any extent and on which there was only
a small duty under the McKinley bill, there
were impor ted 50,000,000 t060,000,000 pounds
per year. Other wools, such as are used in
the manufacture of cloth, etc., had a duty of
11 cents, and the average import for ten years
! under the protective tariff of thnt kind of wool
I did not amount to over 40,000.000 pounds per
I year, and they were only the best wools and
did not hurt our ciomestic wools. Since wools
are on the free list ail kinds of wool are im
ported, with which our wool-growers cannot
compete, and if it lasts much longer all the
wool-growert will have to go out of the busi
ness. Jacob Wollnek.

An Invasion From India Drives Out
the Nativesâ Among the Queer
Fo k ef Burmah.
The Rev. Dr. H. P. Cochraneof the Bap
tist Missionary Union, who has for nine
years been wotking among the Burmans
and natives of India at Tourngoo, Bar
mab, is at the Occidental.
Tourngoo is Â»n ancient town of 17,000
inhabitants in that flat country between
Rangoon and Mandelay. It is a rice
growing country, the rice being cultivated
oy natives, who u&e hump-backed oxen
and water buffalo.
The country, he says, looks much like
that of Western Kansas or Nebraska. Part
of the season it overflows, and whether
the water is on the ground or not it is al
ways hot there. White people soon begin
to take od a sallow look and they grow
languid and dull-eyed. Said Mr. Coch
rane:
"It is very hard making converts
the natives, except as regards the hill
tribes. The others are at the beck and
call of the Buddhist priests, who are very
ignorant in everything except the Budd
hist Scriptures. They are almost tierce in
their religious fanaticism. The majority
of the people are like them, so that when
converts are made tney are ostracized and i
almost persecuted.
"But the natives of India have invaded
teat part of Burmah to a large extent, and
have driven out many of the people. These
Indian natives are quite friendly, and
many converts have Deen made among
them.
"The hill tribes, to which I have alluded,
are called Karnes. They are of good intel
ligence comparatively, and free from j
prejudice. We have now 40,000 Christians ;
among the Karens, while among all the '
others I suppose there are not more than
5000 converts.
â¢We have nearly 100 missionaries in
Burmah, besides the wives of the mission
aries, who do a great deal of good wors,
and two or threo young lady missionaries.
We also have a ilouris ing college in
Rangoon, which now has about 30u stu
dents, most ot whom are burmans. Ran
goon itself has about 180,000 inhabitants.
"The natives about there are extremeiy
slow to adopt an 7 new idea. They havo
an old saying that what was good enough
for their ancestors is good enough lor
them. It is, at most, impossible to change
them. It is not, as it is now in Japan,
when your cook will tell you all the good
points about his Government, together
with what the Government and people
hope yet to do.
"I will say that all the missionaries of
that country are very much interested in
knowing whether silver or gold is to

triumph in this country. The question
directly affects the missionaries. We are
now and always have been paid in gold,
and this money has been exchanged for
silver rupees at whatever they happen to
be worth.
"If the missionaries have to take their
pay in silver they can't live there, Just
now a gold dollar is worth about three
and a half rupees. We are paid in gold
along during the year, and at the close
the average in silver rupees is struck ac
cording to the fluctuations at different
times."
Dr. Cochrane was formerly from Maine,
but his parents now live near Ukiah,
MencJocino County, and he will leave to
day lo visit them. His wife and children
are alone. They have a leave of absence
for two years. As Mrs. Cochrane's health
has been considerably impaired, it is as
yet questionable whether they will return
to Burmah.
HANDBALL COURTS.
Amateur Champion Donnelly and J. C.
Nealon Defeat Coast Champion Kior
dau and M.. J. Kilgallon.
The handball courts were well patron
ized yesterday and several exciting and
closely contested games were witnessed.
At the San Francisco court P. T. Don
nelly, the amateur champion, and J. C.
Nealon played against John Riordan, the
coast champion, and M. J. Kilgallon. It
was one of tbe finest games ever seen in
the court, the four players being thorough
experts and up to ail the fine points. It
was characterized by rare judgment and
Driiliant rallies. Donnelly and Nealon
won, carrying off three games to their op
ponents' one.
Last Thursday Nealon and Donnelly
played a single-hand game as an outcome
of two matches played the previous Sun
day and Donnelly^won in three straight
games by the score, 21â19, 21â6, 21â10.
At the Union court the event of the day
was a game in which J. Harlow and J,
Roger played against R. Lenihan, the
overhand swiper, and J. Nelson. Harlow
and Roger won after a close and exciting
struggle. Terry McManus, the heavy
weight champion, played a single-hand
game against G. T. Wilds of Concord and
the stranger was the victor.

Election November 3, J896.
Attend to politics this week.
Work for sound money and prosperity.
Make up your mind to join the big pa
rade.
Get your decorations ready for the Sat
urday demonstration.
Now is the time to take the lid off and
let your enthusiasm boil up.
Pat in your work this week for the
whole ticket and a clean sweep.
There will be more fun for Republicans
in Illinois tbis week than Bryan can shake
his tongue at.
The Popocrats are claiming everything
and at the same time flying to the woods
shouting coercion.
You will hear a great deal of coercion
this week, but you will not see any of it
nor a proof of any.
Show your colors and assert your prin
ciple* ; be an earnest factor in the battle
for good government.
The labor vote can be counted on for the
stalwart champion of labor. McKinley is
the man for the masses.
We must show Tom Reed that San
Francisco means business and under
stands how to attend to it.
After election day the Populists and
Democrats will have a lively time decid- j
ing who upset the apple-cart.
There will be true harmony in tbe music
to which loyal Republicans and conserva
tive Democrats march together.
One more week of agony for the Popo
crats and then they will have a chance to
crawl off to a quiet place and nurse their
wounds.
Bear in mind Colonel Taylor's services
to the City and do what you can to elect
him Mayor by a majority he can be
prond of.
â¢ Push the fight aggressively during the
week and by the time of the grand rally
on Saturday all will be over but the
shouting.
Republican sentiment even in Nevada
has shown itself so strong tbe Bryanites
are raising the cry that Mark Hanna has
bought the whole State.
Mark Hanna evidently knows how to
put dynamite in nis questions, for he has
just exploded another campaign lie by
simply asking for a proof of it.
We know what prosperity we had under
protection ; we know the disaster wrought
by free trade; we know which road leads
to the welfare of our people, and that road
we will take on election day.
The honest-money Democrats of 1896
will be honorably remembered like the
war Democrats of 1860. Tbe people of
this country never fail to respect a man
who shows that his patriotism is greater
than his partisanship.
Any man who knows of an attempt at
the coercion of voters and does not take
steps to prosecute the guilty party is him
self a participant in the crime. The Popo
crat organs and orators will please take
Dotice of the law and govern themselves
accordingly.
Chairman Jones of Arkansas, the Popo
crat manager, advises his party this year
to raise the stars and stripes over their
homes and houses of business, but it is
cot so long ago chat this same Jones was
urging his partisans not only to fly an
other flag but to fight for it.
Somebody has dug up in France a
prophecy written 300 years ago by a cer
tain Frere Phillippe Olivarius of the Ab
bey of Ceteaux, which predicts the de
structicn of Paris this year, and there is
said to be a good deal of excitement over
it, particularly among people who do not
understand bow a pious frere of the six
teenth century could be as big a liar as a
weather propnet of to-day.
The exultation of young Democrats over
the big crowds that attend Bryan's
speeches is not shared by the members of
the party who are old enough to remem
ber the ovations that greeted Greeley
when he went over the same States Bryan
has traversed. The old Roman made a
great distinction between an "ovation"
and a triumph, and Bryan will find out
what the distinction is on election day.
The sentiment in. favor of International
bimetallism is strong in all the great na
tions of the earth, and a Republican ad
ministration in this country entering of
fice under a pledge to promote it would
find sufficient support in European Gov
ernments to enable us to resume the free
coinage of silver in a short time under
terms that would maintain monetary sta
bility and inflict no injury upon business
or industry.
A GREAT OCCASION.
The great parade and the. splendid re
ception to Hon. Thomas B. Reed, taken
together with the address of that states
man, will cause next Saturday to be
thenceforth noled as one of the great days
in the history of California. There is no
doubt that the passage of Mr. Reed
through the State will partake of the
nature of a triumphal march and that the
reception which San Francisco will ac
cord him will equal if it does not surpass
that with which General Grant was
honored upon his visit to our shores.
The meeting of the merchants and lead
ing citizens held on last Saturday and the
action there taken are a certain assurance
of the entire success of the great parade
and of Mr. Reed's reception. The com
mittees there appointed, acting in har
mony with the Republican State Central
Committee, the Union League and other
Republican clubs, are already setting in
motion the forces which insure success.
The Rtpublicaus of San Francisco, to
gether with those who, although not
Republicans, are in sympathy with
their cause in this election, should co
operate hsartily with those in whose
hands has been placed the duty of arrang
ing the details of this great event.
Every industry, every enterprise and
every institution which favors the success
of the Republican party should make a
display of its favor in the great parade.
The workingmen of San Francisco
who are voting for a return of pros
perity should march on next Saturday
as they intend to vote on the Tuesday
following, and by so doing put to shame
and silence the cry of coercion. Every
voter in San Francisco who can carry a
transparency or wave a banner should be
in line. The experience of the great cities
of the country in the matter of parades
should be repeated and even surpassed on
Saturday next.
Following the parade in the evening
Hon. Thomas B. Reed will speak. He
comes to us as a worthy successor in our
favor to the man whose name California
has most delighted to honor. He comes
also heralded by his fame as an orator
ana logician. He will be here to fitly and
splendidly close the Republican cam
paign. He will probably remain with us
nntil after election day. Let U3 see to it
that in her political action a week from to
morrow California will prove to her visit
ing statesman that she is a worthy sister
to Maine in her devotion to the cause of
the Republican party.
Patrick Henry said: "There is one
lamp by which nay feet are guided, and
that is the light of experience. I have
no light for the future bat the light of
the iÂ»a9t." If the voters would remem
ber bow many times nations have ex
perimented with bimetallism they
wouiil know how to treut the free
coinage issue. They would know what
social disturbances have attended the.se
experiments, what diitregg â to em
ployed and employers alike â what dire
results to those to whom the loss of
little was the loss of all.â Robert T.
Lincoln. __________^__
THE LAST WEEK.
We have reached the closing week of the
campaign. The argument of the contend
ing parties has been exhausted. Citizens
of every class among the people have in
the main aligned themselves on one side
or the other. The remaining days of the
contest must be devoted chiefly cot so
much to convincing men of the justice of
the Republican cause as to that of rousing
them to the importance of casting a
straight vote for protection and pros
perity.
In this work of awakening party en
thusiasm and inspiring every individual
to do his full duty on election day the
personal influence of each citizen of repute
will count for something. Every man
therefore who realizes the importance of
tbe issues at stake should come forth in
these days and by mingling with his
fellow-men exert all the influence he
possesses to awaken in them a resolve to
perform their whole duty as patriots on
the day of election.
Loyal Republicans and conservative
Democrats should during the whole of
this week work together for the good cause
in which they are united. They should
vie with one another as to which can
do most to rebuke the agitators and main
tain the dignity and honor of the Repub
lic. To every such citizen the appeal goes
forth from those who understand the
gravity of the situation that they should
be earnest, active and vigorous in combat
ing the men who in this campaign have
shamed the honored name of Democracy
and art striving to shame the name of the
Nation Itself.
In a hundred ways good citizens can
manifest their loyalty to the cause of good
government. They can hang the banners
of protection, sound money and prosperity
from their offices and places of business.
They can by earnest talk to all with whom
they come in contact stimulate them to
new zeal and to greater energy in the can
vass. Thus by party banners openly dis
played and by patriotic conversation
every citizen can do much to make the
victory which is now well assured an
overwhelming one.
Let the word therefore go forth : Show
your colors. Assert yourselves. Make
ready for the grand rally on Saturday.
Get into line for protection and prosperity.
Count as one among the patriots who will
welcome the coming of Top Reed to San
Francisco. Be a vital lactor in the battle
for the supremacy of law and order. Cali
fornia must be carried for McKinley and
Hobart. Make your record good by join
ing ihe ranks of those who are fighting for
the great cause.
The protective system protects our
own products against those of the alien
and the stranger, while the domestic
consumer is secured reasonable price
through domestic competition. It op
poses trusts and combinations to con
rol the markets and prices to the injury
of the people ; for it iÂ» opposedrto free
trade, which has been the parent of
trusts, and insists that competition with
the Old World shall be on equal condi
tions, made so by the tariff.â McKinley.
SINGLE STANDARD CONFESSED.
Professor Ross of Stanford University,
who is in favor of the free coinage of sil
ver, flatly confesses that the attempt on
the part of this country alone to have free
coinage would cause our goid to leave us
and silver to come in its stead. At Metro
politan Hall in San Francisco, Friday
evening, Professor Ross said :
By taking some silver from the bullion mar
ket of the worm and by letting go of some of
our goldâ by making additions to our cur
rency in sliver and letting the gold go abroad;
taking the silver from other nations and
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, OCTOBER 26, 1896.
making the additions to the European curren
cies with our goldâ in some such way alone
would it be possible to bring the ratio of 16 to
Iâ the releasing of $300,000,000 of gold and
the taking of $300,000,000 from the silver of
the world ana incorporating it into our cur
rency would be to brine the ratio of 26 to 1
(the present ratio between silver and gold
prices in tne markets of the world) to the
ratio of 16 to 1.
Look at that proposition ! The way to
raise silver from 26 to 1 to 16 to 1 is to take
$300,000,000 in gold, go to Europe and buy
silver with it, and bring that silver home
and coin it into dollars.
But why stop with $300,000,000? It is
not proposed that this is to be done by the
Government, but by individuals; and they
will keep doing it so long as Europe has
silver to exchange for gold and we have
gold to exchange for silver. That is, we
let all our gold go and take all the silver
that our gold will buy, i. c., pasa to the sin
gle silver standardâ just what the Republi
cans have claimed all along, what Bryan
and his followers have disclaimed, and
what E. A. Ross of Stanford, the idolized
champion of the silver cause on this coast,
has now specifically admitted.
Tbis is a most remarkable and most im
portant admission, and it forces a most
embarrassing alternative upon the Bryan
ites on this coast Either they must re
pudiate their candidate, who asserts that
free coinage of silver will not drive this
country to the single silver standard, or
they must repudiate their heretofore idol
ized professor of economics at Stanford.
The dominant note in Mr. Bryan's
utterances and in the campaign waged
in his behalf is the note of hysteria.
Mengrs. Bryan, Altgeltl, Tillman, Dele,
Coxey and the rest have not the power
to rival the deeds of Marat, Barrere
and Robespierre, but they are strik
ingly like the leaders of the Terror of
France in incut il and moral attitude,
plus an added touch of the grotesque
rising; from the utter folly as well as
the base dishonesty of their trying to
play such a role In such a country as
ours, For Mr. Bryan we can feel the
contemptuous pity it 1 ways fVlr for the
small man unexpectedly thrust into
a big place. He does not look well In a
lion's akin, but that is chiefly the fault
of those who put this skin on hint. â
Theodore Roosevelt
QUAY'S PREDICTION.
It is now well assured that McKinley
will be the next President of the United
States. The desperate leaders of the fusion
party see no chance of success and are en
deavoring to discount the certain defeat
that awaits them by raising the cry that
voters are to be intimidated at the polls.
This cry of coercion need not alarm and
probably does not alarm any intelligent
citizen. All the business elements of the
people well understand that the election
of McKinley means the coming of pros
perity and no senseless campaign cry will
turn them from their firmly fixed pur
pose of electing the man who will bring
better times to every trade and every in
dustry.
The most conservative estimate which
has been made of the Republican vote is
that of Senator Quay, who, after a careful
study of the situation announces that 270
votes in the electoral college are certain
for the Republican ticket. In addition to
these there are sixty-seven votes which
are more likely to be cast for McKinley
than for the Bryanites. This estimate
may be accepted a3 reliable. S3nator
Quay is well known for the accuracy of his
forecasts of political votes. He never ex
aggerates bis claims and never hesitates
to admit defeat if defeat is certain.
It will be remembered that shortly be
fore the St. Louis convention, when it was
still doubtful who would receive the nomi
nation, Mr. Quay, who was then one
of the strongest leaders in opposition to
Mr. McKinley, did not hesitate to declare
that Mr. McKinley would be nominated
as soon as his study of tne situation con
vinced him of the fact. That was charac
teristic of the man. He never claims any
thing as a political bluff. He has never
misled any one by statements made
merely for campaign purposes. When he
knows the truth he speaks it and his esti
mate of the coming vote for McKinley
may be relied upon as that of a frank and
outspoKen student of American politics.
In giving his estimate of the vote Mr.
Quay did not give the details nor name
States which he expects the Republican
party to carry. His reason for tbis silence
is obvious. It is no part of hi 3 business
to let the fusion managers know what
States are regarded as doubtful by the Re
publican leaders. It is not, therefore, cer
tain whether Mr. Quay's information puts
California in the list of doubtful States or
not. It depends upon the Republicans of
the State to determine whether or no it is
to be doubtful. With the co-operation of
conservative Democrats, who will not be
foolish enough in a closely contested elec
tion to throw their votes away on Palmer
and Buckner, it will be easy for stalwart
Republicans to carry tne State, despite
the defection of all those extreme free- si I
verite Republicans who are not willing to
wait for the establishment of bimetallism
by international agreement.
Sound-money, law-loving Democrats
can do much to aid in the ejection of Mc-
Kinley, and will undoubtedly do so, but
they cannot be expected to take the lead.
That duty must be performed by Repub
licans, and every Republican who has in
fluence among bis neighbors can do much
to advance the good cause. It needs only
that Republicans assert themselve/to win
over to tbelr side all the wavering, doubt
ful and hesitating elements of the people.
Ihe call to duty is the call for an ag
gressive campaign. Let it be prosecuted
with vigor. Victory in the Nation is sure.
Let us make it equally sure in California.
THE APPEAL TO PATRIOTISM.
"The inspiring and unconquerable senti
ment of this campaign is country first,
country last and country with stainless
honor all the time. The voice of the mis
guided partisan is not heeded. The voice
of patriotism strikes a responsive chord this
year. The voice of prejudice and hate is
lost in the grand chorus of peace and good
will, National integrity and National
honor."
In these words of William McKinley,
addressed to Confederate" veterans who
visited him to assure him of their loyalty
to the Union and their devotion to Na
tional prosperity and the financial honor
of the Nation, the people can find a suf
ficient antidote to the. bitter and envious
words of Bryan and an assurance that the
demagogues and agitators will not prevail,
but that the country will remain in the
hands of patriot citizens.
It becomes more clearly evident every
day that in turning aside from the discus
sion of the tariff and silver questions to
make an appeal to prejudice and ignor
ance, in the vain hope of converting this
into a campaign of labor against capital,
the Bryanites have made a mistake of
politics as well as of patriotism. By the
speeches of their orators and organs they
have alienated the conscience and the in
telligence of the people. They have turned
againat them many a free-trader and many
an advocate o! free silver who would have
voted for Mr. Bryan as an advocate of
those measures, but who will not vote for
him as the champion of the lawless ele
ments of the country and a leader in paths
that tend to civil disturbance and anarchy.
Very striking indeed is the contrast be
tween the two men who to-day are seeking
the suffrages of the American people.
Major McKinley, the soldier boy, shows
himself in every speech to be a statesman
who measures up to that high standard
below which American Presidents have
but rarely fallen. Broadly National in Bis
politics, as in his patriotism, his appeals
are to men of all elements in oar society
and of ail sections in our Union. They
carry inspiration with them to every
genuine lover pf his country. While Mr.
Bryan travels from stump to stump, en
deavoring by every means in his power to
excite discontent, Mr. McKinley, from the
porch of his cottage home, speaks to the
thousands who visit there, not more as
partisans than as patriots, and in lofty
words reminds them that above all other
issues in this contest is the great one of
"country first, country last and country
with stainless honor all the time."
COAST EXCHANGES.
James Hagen, candidate for Sheriff of Sno
homish County, Washington, is certain of the
unqualified support of at least one newspaper
during the campaign. He has secured control
of the Everett Independent, having liquidated
a mortgage on the plant, and has placed J. W.
Gunn in charge of the publication.
The Santa Cruz Surf challenges the world to
produce a pumpkin equal in weight to one
raised by Charles H. Rogers of that place.
This particular Santa Cruz pumpkin is eight
feet in circumference the long way, and four
feet the short way, and its weight is 215
pounds.

The Los Angeles Times says that the walnut
industry of Southern California is rapidly
growing in importance. "Nuts are now being
shipped from Rivera at the rate of from three
to five carloads a day; Fullerton has been
shipping about two carloads a day, ana Tustin
will ship about ten carloads this season. Wul
nuts have been paying fully as well as any
horticultural product in this section during
the past few years, and the attention of many
farmers has been turned in this direction by
the encouraging results achieved. It should
be remembered, however, that the area of
land in Southern California that is thoroughly
well adapted to walnut culture is com
paratively limited."
As a little example of the benefit to farmers
of a beet-sugar factory, the following item
from the San Leandro Reporter is interesting:
"The beet-sugar mill at Alvarado has been
running night and day for two months, and
will not close for at least two months more.
Beets are coming in so fast that an increase in
the storage-room has been made, and a new
shed 400 feet long and 30 feet wide, to hold
2000 tons of beets, is being built. Farmers
are still hauling to the mill; and Pieasanton is
sending fifteen cars a day. The crop around
the township averages fourteen tons to the
acre, arid the price is if 4 a ton."
With reference to the movement on foot to
have redwood lumber specified by the archi
tects in the plans for the Affiliated Colleges,
the Red Bluff People* Cause declares tnat "it
is about time the people of the State were wak
ing up to the fact that many thousands of
dollars leave California every month and go
into the pockets of the lumber tings of Ore
gon. All of this money could be kept at home
by the use of redwood for building purposes.
There is no question raised regarding the rela
tive merits of the woods. It is a matter of
business to the people of this State, and when
they realize the importance to local prosperity
in patronizing home products and home man
ufacture California will enter upon an era of
progress it has not heretofore kno>Vn."
The Carson (Nev.) Appeal Is booming the
proposition for a starch factory in the Silver
State. It says that among the many capabili
ties of Nevada soil is the raising of the meali
est and whitest potatoes in America. "An
analysis of the Nevada potato has developed
the fact that it contains a higher percentage
of starch than any known analysis of the
product from other States. Potatoes can be
raised in abundance in Nevada; In fact, the
black soil of the Humboldt and Paradise val
leys is particularly adapted to potato culture.
The cost of a factory is comparatively small,
and the process of extracting, drying and pul
verizing the B tarch is very simple. It is said
that Eastern parties are contemplating start
ing such a factory in Nevada. Under the pres
ent low price of potatoes and under preseut
transportation charges, in which the railroad
adjusts its rates so as to eat up the profit, a
scientifically conducted starch factory would
yield an equal of 2 cents a pound for potatoes."
In every rural section of California the peo
ple are bestirring themselves in efforts to
secure one of the several sugar factories that
Claus Spreckels contemplates building. Here
is what the Woodland Democrat says in regard
to the desired location of one of them in Yolo
County :
"The whole community should take an
active interest in the matter, as the establish
ment of a factory in our midst would add from
200 to 250 workingmen, earning wages which
average over Sg'2 a day. to our population.
"In the town ot Watsonvllle, where the
SpreckelÃ factory is located, over 100 new
houses were built last year and the same ratio
is being kept up this year. The general busi
ness of the whole community is better than
ever before in its history, and careful inquiry
elicited the fact that it was due mainly to the
sugar-beet industry, as the other agricultural
interests were sufficing from the same de
pression as elsewhere.
"There is food for earnest, careful thought in
this for the business men of our community.
They realize painfully that cereals and fruit,
except for spasmodic rises brought about by a
shortage elsewhere or the manipulations of
large dealers, do not pay an adequate return
on tne money and labor invested, and some
thing must be found to take their place."
NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
The use of pigeons for naval rturposes has
been tried on a large scale with success in the
Italian navy. Eighty birds were distributed
between the Sicilia and Savoia flagships and
on the Umberto during the recent autumn
maneuvers.
The United Service Gazette (English) says of
the United States battleships Kearsarge and
Kentucky : "Very grave doubts are felt by
practical men on this side of the Atlantic us
to the wisdom of the adoption in the case oi
these vessels of superimposed turrets, that is
one small tower above a large one amid
ships."
The French battleship Saint-Louis, of 11,275
tons, launched at L'Orient on September 8.
was begun during 1894. Navy building in
France, although much more expeditious now
than a dozen years ago, is much slower then
in England and Germany. The Saint-Louis
and two sister ships, Gitulois and Charlemagne,
will not be ready for trial tor at least two
years.
A protected cruiser, named Barrozo, built
for Brazil, was launched recently atElswick.
She is of 3450 tons displacement and carries a
battery of six 6- inch lifty-caliber quick-firers;
ten 6-pounders; four 1-pounder Norden
feldis; four Maxims and two field guns, be
sides three torpedo tubes. Her speed, with
7500 horsepower, is estimated at twenty knots
and the coal bunker capacity is 800 tons.
The Victorious, battleship, similar in all re
spects to the Majestic class, of which seven
are now in course of constructon in the dock
yards, bad her speed trials last month and
reached 18.7 knots under a forced draught
trial of four hours, and 16.93 knots during an
eight-hour run under natural draught. The
ship was begun May 29, 1894, and was thus
completed in less than twenty-seven months.
Thorough trials have been made in the Ger
man navy with the "Masut" liquid fuel. Large
reservoirs for the stowage ot tbis fuel have
been erected at Wilhelmshnfen, and similar
ones are to be built at Kiel and Danzig. It is
claimed for this fuel that it has advantages
over others in regard to economy, great heal
ing power and rapid stokins, but on the other
hand it has the serious drawback of being
highly inflammable.
The Caesar and Illustrious, first-class battle
ships of 14,900 tons, have been floated out of
the docks in which they were built. The
Caesar, built at Portsmouth, was laid down
March 25, lest year, and floated September 2
last. The Illustrious was laid down at Chatham
March 11, 1895, and came out of her dock on
the 16th of last month. The fact that the
British yards are well provided with docks
enables shipbuilding of that class to be carried
on expeditiously and economically, avoiding
the accidents liable to happen -at the launch
ing ola ship of such great weight.
Complaints from the engineers in the Brit
ish navy are similar to the grievances in our
own. At a recent discussion before the Royal
United Service Institution Staff Engineer Ed
wards referred to the peculiar position of the
naval engineers, "who appear to be in the
service, but not of it." People outside the
navy had an idea that the naval engineer was
something like a penny steamboat man or the
driver of a locomotive. The remedy, he con
tended^, was to make the engineer officer an
executive officer in his own department and
have tne stylo and title to indicate his posi
tion.

Letters From the People.
THE INTEREST OF FARMERS
The Hffect of FrÂ«e Trade and the Reason
It Teachea.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir:
Will it be better for farmers to vote for Mc-
Kinley and Hobart, who stand for a high pro
tective tariff ; or for Bryan and Sewall, who
champion free trade and the free and unlim
ited coinage of silver? Did the McKinley
tariff of 1890 accomplish anything for the
farmer? Lat us see. By reference to the
proper statistics we find that in 1888, with no
dnty on barley, the import to the United States
amounted to 10,820,586 bushels; in 1891, the
McKinley tariff law having gone into effect,
5,078,738 bushels ; in 1892, 3,146,328 bushels ;
tn 1893, 1,970,129 bushels; and in 1894 it had
decreased to 791,061 bushels; In 1895, under
the Gorman-Wilson tariff law, it increased to
2,110,880 bushels.
Do not these figures show that the interests
of our home producers have been sacrificed
that the Canadian farmer might reap the
benefit of a free market for his barely in the
United States?
What wonder is it that the farmers of Ver
mont and Maine spoke aloud at the late elec
tion when we read that petitions signed by
thousands have been circulated throughout
the East asking Congress to increase the duty
on hay, because of the enormous importa
tions from Canada since the repeal of the Re
publican tariff of four dollars per ton on hay.
The effect ot protection on the horse breed-
Ing industry of the United States is manifest
when we compare the exitting low figures ob
tainable for horsefleshâ due to the Gorman-
Wilson hybridâ with the prices current dur
ing the period that the McKinley tariff of
thirty dollars per head stemmed the tide of
cheap Canadian and Mexican horses which
would otherwise have poured into our
principal markets to the disadvantage, and in
some markets, almost to the exclusion of those
bred in the United States, for in many cases
the rates of transportation are less from Canada
to the best Eastern markets than from the
Western States.
Again, what has the repeal of the McKinley
tariff done for our wool industry, and our
raisin, prune and other fruit industries? What
have tney become since forced to compete
with the products of lauds where labor sub
sists on a few cents each day?
Last but not least in importance should be
considered the protection Â»o wisely given by
the McKinley tariff to Petaluma's chief indus
tryâthe tariff of 5 cents per dozen on eggs.
But the Demopops and Popocrats say, "Let us
have none of this. We will subsidize all the
silver mines of our country and all of the
white metal that may be brought from foreign
countries by making 53 cents of silver worth a
dollar." Where does tae farmer get off? This
brings to mind the Democratic cry of four
years ago, "Free trade and clieaD goods." But
they did not then tell the farmer in what way
he was to procure the cheap goodsâ when the
value of his farm products had been sacrificed
to make cheap goods obtainable. Now they
are promising us plenty of cheap money, but
so far have not explained just how the farmer
is to get it.
One question more: If our mints are called
upon to stamp silver from varied sources, will
not our Government eventually be compelled
to either redeem the same or repudiate, and
under certain conditions would not repudia
tion be Inevitable? T. Skillman.

AN EFFECTIVE ARGUMENT.
Boston Herald.
The Bryanite orators are doomed to failure
in theJr attempt to persuade an honest and in
telligent people that a half dollar can be made
a whole dollar by legislation. Why, even the
Italian laborers who have come to this coun
try for work know better than that. Word
comes from New York that a large majority of
the Italians there will vote the Republican
ticket. They have been told that in the event
of Bryan's election the American dollar in
which they would be paid for their labor
would be worth only 53 cents in Italy, and as
they send much money home this argument
has naturally had mucn effect with them. It
is, indeed, a telling argument, and they will
do well to give It conclusive weight at the
polls. â

west of Tiburon. At the close of the
yacut.ng seasons the clumsy old draw
bridge that spans the mouth of tne little
estuary is laboriously lifted and the fleet
crowds into the basin.
The housing of the yachts is always an
occasion of considerable interest and cere
mony with the jolly Corinthians, who
assemble on the "Dridge of sisjhs" to bid
farewell to each craft on her retirement
where she will sleep in her bed of good
soft mud till the vernal equinox.

by a number of launches and arks, towed
into the lagoon. Port Captain "Keefe su
perintended the passage of the yachts and
with the exception of a number of bumps
and scratches caused by the swift tide
I bearing the vessels against the piling the
task was successfully accomplished.
Several of the larger yachts, the Nixie,
Clara, Truant, Emma, Harpoon,
Speedwell and Theima, will be laid up in
their winter quarters elsewhere. The only
I affair on the Corinthian programme now
till the openmg day in tne latter part of
March is a game dinner on New Year's
day at the Tiburou clubhouse.

of wheat carried away is 1,164,789 centals,
valued at $1,423,077. The docks are
crowded witti ships discharging, and a
laree number are awaiting in the stream
their turn at the wharves.
Police Officer Mack, the pride of the
waterfront, yesterday had an adventure
with a would-be suicide. The wild in
dividual was a sailor named Gus Johnson,
and the place of his attempted departure
was Pacific-street wharf. He jumped
overboard, but was fished out by Mack
and after being dried was spread out by
the officer on a lumber pile to dry. He
was not satisfied with his failure in the
drowning line and {.gain dropped into the
bay, saying as he went, "This is wnat I'll
do if McKinley is elected." Mack again
fished him out of the waler, telling the
despondent Popocrat that "This you
might aa well do if Byran is elected." He
was sent to the Receiving Hospital to re
cover and live, at least, till Major McKin
ley is inaugurated.

WERE BUNKOED
AT BASEBALL
The Tufts-Lyons of Los
Angeles Were Sadly-
Abused.
Pitcher Harvey Was Thrown
Oat of the Box by the
Managers.
A TWELVE -INNING GAME.
The Score Being a Tie the Portland
Lads Were Given Another Chanca
to Win.
The Monograms and the Tufts-Lyons
baseball teams met yesterday at Central
Park in the interstate series of games.
They made an interesting showing, con
sisting of some of tne worst and an equal
share oi some of the most exciting playing
ever witnessed on the local diamond field.
The poor showing was made early in the
game, when the Portland boys simply
batted and outplayed the Los Angeles
team to a standstill. ThinK of itâ 9 to 0
in tnree innings, and the Tufts apparently
demoralized. But the change came in the
fourth inning, when Neath was substi
tuted for Farreil in the box and the goose
egged aide showed up with seven home
plates.
In the fifth inning, however, Portland
came back with three runs, the last they
made during the afternoon, but their ad
mirers took it for granted that with their
second wind they would keep piling them
up. In the seventh the Tufts made two
and three in the eighth, evening up the
score.
At the close of the twelfth inning Dun
ovan went to the bat for the Monograms
and struck a hot one to second base, but
was put out at first.
It was at this stage of the game that the
business acumen of the managers of the
games were struck with the idea that a
postponement would result in a tremen
dous audience at the next meeting of the
clubs.
McDonald, the referee, was called from
the field and handed a note instructing
him to declare the play off on account of
darkness.
He did as be was instructed.
That there was some kicking and howl
ing goes without saying, but nobody was
killed, punched or kicked; there were but
few benches and fences broken. The vast
crowd simply took the hipDodrome good
naturedly because it was done for
charity.
The Los Angeles team feels sore. It al
ways intended to play Harvey in the box,
and was prevented from doing so on a
technicality. It appears that Burts, its
manager, overlooked presenting Harvey's
certificate of birth two weeks ago, and
when it was produced yesterday, showing
he was not over 18 years of age, it was laid
on the table as being entirely out of order.
Los Angeles wanted to play hard enough,
although they made a sort o! a bluff that
they wouldn't if they couldn't have
Harvey. But the Examiner people, who
are the Czars in the case, held the Ala
meda Alerts in hand ready to take their
place, and the Los Angeles crowd gave m.
That was their first setback. The last
blow they got was the worst. When,
after playing an uphill game from the
third inninc and tying the score they
were the fresher of the two teams, the
umpire allowed the Monograms to go to
bat. Donovan might have made a run,
although ne was put out at first, but still
lie was given a chance before the manipu
lators suddenly discovered it too dark to
play ball.
Had Dunovan made that run, for in
stance, would the hour have been found
too late to play longer? No; the full
thirteenth inning would have had to be
played out. Why not then have gone
through and given the Tufts as much ad
vantage as the Monograms got of going to
the bat and taking a chance?
As regards the age of the players, Har
vey being barred because he did not prove
soon enough that he was less than 18, it
was the general gossip about the bleachers
that the Portland ladsâ unquestionably
the bigger and heavier players â had to get
a Jate Sunday shave to look within age.

LISTLESS IMPERIALS.
They Lost a Came to the Oaklands
That They Thrice Had Won.
The game at the Folsom-atreet grounds j
yesterday was a most listless exhibition.
Not one of tne players, oatside of Van
Haltren, seemed to care who won, or how.
The spirit of ennui apparently had se
cured the stronger nold on the Imperials,
however, for they nad the contest won no
less than three times and then allowed
victory to slip through their fincers.
The Oaklands were a motley lot. Hunt,
who was to have caught for them, failed to
appear, as did Arnold, who was billed to
pitch. In consequence, Agnew was put
behind the bat ana Shea was brought in
left field to do the twirling. Walters was
transferred from right field to left and
Eber of the San Franciscos pressed into
service in right. Van Haltren, the cele
brated fielder of the New York team,
played in center.
In the initial inning the visitors scored
four runs. Donovan and J. Johnson were
each presented with a base on balls. Ar
lett singled and Van Haltren knocked a
long fly to right, scoring Donovan. Wal
ters lined out a safe one and Johnson and
Arlett crossed the plate. Walters took
second on the throw-in and scored on
Shea's hit.
The Imperials got three men around
the circuit on two bases on balls and two
singles in their half of tbe first inning,
and scored lour more in the second on
seven hits, one of them a double. Only
the most stupid play prevented them from
getting at least two more tallies out of the
fusillade.
The Oaklands added one to their collec
tion in the third, and in the fourth were
fortunate enough to get five more. With
the bases full Walters hit safely and Ma
gee allowed the ball to get by him.
The hit would ordinarily have scored but
one run, but as it was, not only were the
bases cleared but Walters himself com
pleted the circuit.
From that time on the game steadied
down a bit, but the best the Imperials
could do was to tie the score in the eighth.
In the ninth the Athenians earned two
runs on two singles and a double, which
lead was not impaired by the home talent
in their half.

THAT STITCH OR
CRICK I THE BACK.
That sharp, sndden pain which catches you
in the back as you stoop over to lift something
or get upâ it is the forerunner of rheumatism
or lumbago. Let it run a few days and it gets
worse and develops into chronic conditions
that sometimes lay people' up for weeks or
months. Health is easy to lose if you neglect
the warning symptoms. A little care and the
right treatment will restore you now.
DR. SANDEN'S ELECTRIC BELTS afford a
positive remedy for Lame Back, Sciatica,
Lumbago, Kidney Complaints and similar dis-
eases.
ELECTRICITY tones and invigorates the
nerves and muscles, enriches the impoverished
blood and su increases the circulation that the
body is warmed and the whole organism made
to tingle with new life.
Medicine won't cure Rheumatism. Doctors
know it, and if they were honest they would
invariably prescribe electricity, which is na-
ture's own remedy.
Bent Double, and No Pain.
Toano. Nev.. May 6, 1896.
Dr. A. T. Sanbes- Dear Sir: Complying with
your request to report my condition I would say
that I felt ihe power of your B> It the first day I
were it. Before I had the Belt it was with diffi-
culty I could straighten myself or(t after working
in & stooping posit ion. Now I cau work all day
almost btut douW â¢ without tbe slightest incon-
venience. I would not sell my Belt for ten times
what I paid for it if i could not get another. The
cure was perfected in less than two months. Re-
spectfully. _ Joseph Walkeb.
GET IT CUKKD QUICK.
A lame and weak back means several things,
and none of them good for you. Because it
doesn't lay you up is no reason why you should
let it run. It will lay you up some day, and
thenâ well, get a belt now. Anyway, get the
book that tells about it. Sent free, by mail.

An Exciting Barge Contest Between
Crack Crewsâ ln the
New Quarters.
The Dolphin Swimming and Boating
Club held its first "ladies' day" yesterday
at its new clubhouse at the foot of Van
Ness avenue.
A large number of feminine visitors were
present to enjoy the programme of danc
ing, swimming and boating, and all ap
preciated tbe exciting finishes of the boat
and swimming races. Refreshments of a
mild character were passed around, of
which all partook.
J. H. Coughlin, the club's long-distance
swimmer, after participating in two races
and without any preparation swam from
the boatbouse to the Fort Point light, a
distance of about three and a half miles,
in the quicK time of one hour and fifteen
minutes. This is an unprecedented f*;it
and the club feels justly proud in posses
sing Mr. Cougblin, who they think is a
second "Cavill." .
The boatracea appeared to be exceed
ingly interesting, as the finishes were
close. The first race to be contested was a
mile skiff between J. H. Coughliu ana W.
0. Patch, ending in a victory for the for
mer by one length.
T. J. Kennedy and R. Blennerhassett
rowed a akiffrpce for a mile. The race was
a close one and was won by Kennedy in a
spurt.
The third event was a swimming race
for a quarter of a mile between Bob and
Ed Strolle. The latter is the champion
short-distance swimmer of the coast. He
defeated his brother by a length and a
half.
In the fifty-yard swimming race for a
gold medal C. M. Farrell won, with J.
Marron a close second.
The four-oared barge race between the
California and the Cuckoo was won by
the California. The crew of tbe Cali
fornia were McCausland, stroke; Tom
Hopkins, after waist; T. J. Sullivan, for
ward waist; J. Marron, bow, and J.Wessels,
cockswain. The crew or the Cuckoo
were J. H. Coughlan, stroke; T. J. Ken
nedy, after wai3t; Charles Farrell, forward
waist; vV*. 0. Patch, bow, and K. Blenner
hassett, cockswain. The Cuckoos claim
tbey Jost the race by unshipping an oar.
Captain Thompson had one of his bicy
cle-boats on the scene and cave an inter
esting exhibition of its utility.
The officers of the day were: T. R.
Kiernan, judge; T* A. Keougb, an
nouncer; Adam Schupert, timekeeper.
On Wednesday evening next the club
will give an entertainment and ball.
Good talent has been procured and tbe
club expects the event to surpass all
previous affairs.

DONALD M. ROSS
AT THE TEMPLE
He Explains the Purposes
of the A. P. A. in
Politics.
Declares the Order Is Not Reli
gious but for Good Gov
ernment.
UPON MARKING THE BALLOT.
The Speaker Cautions His Hearers to
Vote for Men of Known
Honesty.
The announcement that Donald M. Ross
was to address the Good Citizenship meet
ing yesterday afternoon resulted in Metro
politan Temple being filled almost to its
limit. Commenting on the increased at
tendance, Chairman Quitzow in opening
the meeting said:
"It has long been said that we are dead.
If this be death, this is the kind of death
that we expected to die. I think on the
31 of next November the people will show
that there has been a grand resurrection."
Aftera song by Baby Mearii3 the modus
operandi of voting under the prevailing
law was explained by Chairman Quitzow.
In the course of his explanation he re
ferred eulogistically to each of the candi
dates on the Citizens' Independent ticket
and urged his hearers to avoid carefully
any mistakes in marking their ballots for
tnese nominees. Applause greeted the
mention of each name.
A patriotic song by Alvina Set!) man
preceded tUe address of the afternoon by
Donald M. Iloss. The appearance of Mr.
Ross was the signal for a hearty demon
stration of welcome.
Tne subject of his address was "The
Political Purposes of the A. P. A." Be
fore entering upon tne discussion of the
theme announced, Mr. Ross made a brief
personal statement in which he expressed
his pleasure in the opportunity presented
to nim to show he was undaunted by
the charges which had been brought
again.-t him. He expressed the belief
that in a short time he would be able to
prove the falsity of all those charges.
Speaking to the subject of his address,
be said:
"An impression has gone abroad to
the effect that tne American Protective
Association has something to do with
religion. Either Ido not understand the
American Proteciive Association an-i the
vows I took, or the American Protective
Association has no more to do with re
ligion tnan it has to do with the South
Sea Islanders. While the American Pro
tective Association does not stand against
religion, it wishes to see religion, as an
organized force, eliminated from politics.
If this is attacking religion it is Attacking
my religion as much as yours. The prin
ciple is as applicable to Presbyteriauism
as it is to Catholicism."
Tne speaker referred to the clause in the
association's platform in regard to the
payment of public lunds to sectarian in
stitutions, and in regard to immigration
as illustrations ot the position of the order
and in line with his contention. He spoke
appreciatively of tho number of first-class
cit:zens who appeared on the principal
tickets, and pointed out that this was an
indication ol awakening civic pride.
"While I would not ask you to vote for
one man more than another," he said, "I
will say to you : 'Look carefully over the
ticket that ia presented to you. Choose
out the men who have been from their
childhood men of honor and men of pro
bity. That is the mission o! the Ameri
can Protective Association, as I under
stand it, the placing of men of honor in
public positions.' When you place in of
nee men whose hair has grown gray in
honorable walks of life then you will have
the business of the City conducted as you
would have your own business conducted.
Don't be one of those who say that a man
suddenly gets bad when he ifets in office.
The man who has led a life of honor for
sixty years is not going to forsake his pro
bity for the little the bribers can offer
him."
The speaker declared that there was
nothing in the principles of the American
Protective Assciation ihat should warrant
its opposition by one denomination more
than another.
"I admit," he said, "that some things
have been said by men claiming lo repre
sent the association which are not *n
dorsed by that organization, and which
never should have bepn said.
"If there is any member in this order
who should oppose a good man on account
of his religion lam ashamed of him. If a
clerk is a good clerk and is a Roman
Catholic, he should have the place. Xo
clerk should be removed from a deport
ment on account of his religion. That is
the very thing we are righting against. If
the man who is favored by this order is
elected Mayor, and the charter is passed,
I believe he will appoint officials not on
account of religion or non-religion, but be
cause of their competency. 1 believe the
departments will be filled by worthy men,
without even inquiring what their re
ligion is."
In conclusion, Mr. Ross again ureed
upon voters to mark their ballots con
scientiously, nfter due consideration.
Sold Her Husband for 5750.
William T. Harris, a railroad telegraph
operator of Hammond, Ind., was sold re
cently by his wife Susan to Miss Carrie
West for $750. Several months ago Harris
came to Delphi, Ind., leaving his wife and
child at Hammond. While serving as
night-operator on the Monon here he met
Miss West, who recently inherited a )or
tunc from her foster mother, Mrs. James
H. Stewart. Miss West fell in love with
him and took him to her home to live.
Mrs. Harris recently applied for divorce,
and on the Bth inst. her lawyer. Attorney
Knotts of Hammond, informed Miss West
that Mrs. Harris was willing to give up
her husband for cash. Miss West accord
ingly made the purchase. The heirs of
Mrs. Stewart have brought suit to set aside
the will which gave Miss West every
thing.âSt. Loufs Republic. .

Explanation.
iV The arrow flies with' the wind. The top figures
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
days; those underneath It. If any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow In inches and hundredtbs.
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines,, connect poln s of equal air pressure; Iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. '1 he
word "hteh" means high barometric pressure and
is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
rf fers' to low : pressure, and' is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rain*.
â¢â¢Lows"-usually first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high In the interior
and i low along the coast, and the Isobars extend
north and south along thÂ« coast, rain is probable;
but when' the, "low" Is inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in ihe vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in 1, summer, and colder
weather In winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result.

It is not easy to see on what basis the
fusioniats of Alameda County build t e>r
hopes. Unless there is more clear-cut
hypocrisy rampant in the county than
ever beforeâ and the man versed in local
.'. politics will always allow for a very liberal
prevalence of dcccit â the prospect for the
Popocrat is not a happy one. It is no ex
aggeration to say that the body of A!a
rneaa's old-time Democracy, the Jeffsr
soiiian followers, are now in the Republi
â¢ can camp, and that only the garments,
the discarded covering, has allied with the
..-. Populists. The additions to the party
/ that can after tne developments of the
past week be called the party of honesty
â¢â¢, are daily increasing and the allied party
has to make considerable effort to prevent
.all the defections from their ranks becom
ing known to the public. Many of the
men not prominent in local politics are
employes of the mint, and for four years
â¢ -have taken their orders from John Dag
gett. Does any one suppose for a moment
.-.-" that Daggett's cohorts are tree silver men ?
' And where is William D. English, itie
: â â¢ Democratic stalwart, and brother ol War
â  . ren 8., the fusion nominee for Congress?
._ " For the first time in the history of the
Democratic house of English there is a
division. Not a word In favor of his
". ' brother's candidacy or the cause of free
.- silver has William D. uttered in public
â  during this campaign, and one of the most
â  prominent members of the County Central
. ' Committee said this week that William D.
is a pronounced gold man, such as his
brother Warren declared himself to be
only a few months ago.
Governor Budd spoke here last night,
but there was no enthusiasm. There was
a parade, some cheering aud some free
silver talk at the Tabernacle, but there
â ' was no need for two people to attempt to
â¢â¢ occupy the same seat. Take away the
band, the redfire, the rockets and Roman
candles that were paid for by the State
'. Silver Committee, and the parade would
not have drawn out 500 people. It was
. really a Populist proces>ion and a smaller
showing was made tnan two years ago in
the county campaign; und Governor
Budd and "Robert If. Fitzgerald rode in a
carriage after the band.
The barbecue at Haywards that was so
thoroughly t-n joyed because everything |
was free, from food to friendliness, con- :
veyed a lesson that must have appealed to
all who have had the pleasure of wituess
ing a similar gathering in a country j
cursed with a legalized depreciated cur
rency.
A few years ago I attended a grand bar
becue given by the Capitan del Puerto at
â¢ Babia Blanca in the Argentine Republic
The picture presented was similar to that
which prevailed in feudal England. There
were hien tables and low tables and the
slaves (peons) ate at the lower table. The
captain and his sycophants never spoke to
the crowds of laborers present except with
extreme haughtiness and contempt. The
men who attended and who were not spe-
c ial guests earned :rom 20 to 40 cents a day
â¢' and worked from twelve to fourteen hours
a day. They ate food that an American
would not consider and were frightened to
. even raise their heads erect if their owner
Were looking at them.
Contrast this w.th Haywards, with the
â . picture of Congressman Hilborn and Gen
. . eral Barnes standing in line with other
free men and waiting to have their tin
'cups filled with coffee. The difference is
the difference between an honest and a
depreciated currency.
All Oakland is rejoicing that there is to
â¢. be a municipal election in the spring. It
is now a matter of no great moment
. whether Mayor Davie or the Board of
Works or the City Council is responsible
for the ludicrous administration of the
. last two years. It is, however, of great
moment that it should cease. Such tactics
as have been pursued by the various
â¢branches of the city government have had
an evil effect and have created unpleasant
impressions abroad. The present stage o:
â¢. the rumpus is worse than absurd. At
â¢ â  each meeting of the various bodies some
members appear with long type-written
A New Pastor at Work.
ALAMEDA. Cal., Oct. 25.â The members of the First Baptist Church turned out
in larce numbers to-day to greet the Rev. J. F. Moody, their tew pastor, who arrived
from Willows during the past week.
After the preliminaries this morning Mr. Moody opened his pastorate with the
following words: "We all have a part in tbe First Baptist Cnurcb of Oakland. We
must all work as if it all depended upon us for its lite. If yon do this we will be.suc
cesslul. Christian manliness is freedom from narrowness, from littleness and from
selfishness. The lack of these principles in California is tbe ctuse of the depletion of
our churches to-day, and the possession of them by Christiaas adds to the Sunday
picnic, Sunday racing and Sabbath desecration generally."
The new pastor has been in the ministry for seventeen jears past, and came to
this State from Missouri.

and criticized, while the gallery laughs

parade, in which will be represented not only
all classes ot our fellow-citizens, but visiting
uniformed clubs from all the bay counties.
Your organization, whether uniformed or
not, is cordially invited to participate In this
final ana patrioiic event, and, anticipating
your favorable response, kindly advise the
undersigned the probable number of your

COMPARED TO LOTTERIES.
Rev. F. D. Ilovard Scores Merchants,
Supervisors aud Fatrons of Race
Tracks.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Oct. 25.â The Rev. F.
D. Bovardol the Park-street M. E. Church
introduced his sermon to-night with a
prelude on the "Shell Mound Race Track
and Our County Morals." He spoke in
part as follows:
"The arguments used by the representa
tives of the Merchants' Exchange of Oak
land in favor of the Shell Mound Race
Track are on the same moral plane with
those used by the Louisiana Lottery man
agersâthat it will bring money to the
locality. If it is true that Oakland is
proud of tho notoriety this will eive her,
she is doubi ess the only city in the Onion
that would glory in such dearly purchased
fame; but I do hot believe that the Mer
chants' Exchange has richtly reflected
the popular feeling of Oaklan I, nor have
the Supervi.- >rs in this matter considered
the best int.- rests of this county.
"There are two plain questions for the
Merchants' Exchange and tae Super
visors to consider: First, Where will the
money come from to support this track?
second, What will the California Jockey
Club give in exchans: c for it ?''
PRAISES FOR MRS. HEARS T
University People Express Their
Gratification at Her Kind
Offers.
Eight Ycun? Women Now Being
Educated at Berkeley Through
Hr Benevolence.
BERKELEY, C.vl., Oct. 25.â There was
great rejoicing to-day, among university
people in Berkeley over the generous offer
! of Mrs. Phoebe Hearst to erect two build-
I ings on the campus at a cost in the neigh
j borhood of $300,000, and to defray the ex
; pens â  of $15,000 to be incurred in securing
permanent plans for the laying out of the
university grounds.
Too much could not be said in her
praise, because of the fact that the offer
comes at a time when buildings of the sort
she proposes to erect are most needed.
Mrs. Hearst has been generous in , the
past toward the university and twenty or
more young ladies have been educated
here through her benevolence who would
not have otherwise been able to secure a
i college course. At the present time there
i are eight young women students who are
I receiving $300 a year each from Mrs.
I Hearst. . .

DEMOCRATS LOSE COURAGE
Aa Flection Day Approaches the Silver
itet Feel Their Cause la Hopeless.
There were evidences of great discour
agement at silver headquarters yesterday.
As the day of doom for Bryani'sm draws
near the Popocrats seem to read the hand
writing on the wall and their courage is
waning. Even Judge Harris and Manager
Lawler now look woe-begone and bone
less. The coming of Reed fills them with
a nameless terror, and all the Popocratic
counsels have not been able to conjure up
an orator tit to follow the illustrious man
from Maine.
There will be a Republican meeting of
Danish and Norwegian Americans at
Pythian Castl-, 909 Market street, to
night. Able speakers will be present.

NEWS OF THE TURF.
Weights and Entries for Handicap?
to Be Run in the Near
.'Future.
It is more than likely that if the Califor
nia Jocfcey Club wishes to popularize its
Oakland track a chesiper rate of trans
portation will have to.be furnished race
goers. At present if a person wishes to
attend the races across the bay tne round
trip costs him $130, which includes car
and ferry-boat fare and admission to the
track. As a ticket can be secured at the
depot, Fourth and Townsend streets, for
$1, which carries the bearer to and from
Ing eside, as well as entitling him to ad
mission to the track, the race-going public
lO' ked for the same rate to the Oakland
track. Hence tne grumbling. There was
also considerable "kicking" about the
delay in getting home from the track, but
as it was an opening day, and all seemed
anxious to get aboard the first train, this
annoyance could scarcely have beeu obvi
atpd.
Handicapper Brooks has issued the
weights ior the starters in the sevr-n-fur
long handicap, to be decided on Tuesday,
the closing day. Following are the en
tries: Vinctor 115, Installator 110 Ne
buchadnezzar &8, Peter the Second 80,
Wheel of Fortune, 106, Cce>arion 102, St.
Lee 97, Alvarado 90, Ruinart 106, bir Flay
92. Midnight 87, Chartreuse II 98, Belii-
coso 106, Grady 90, Mount McGregor 102,
Rosebu.i 98.
The handicapper at Ingleside certainly
has a difficult task before him in weighing
the titty -six entries for the ''opening-day"
handicap, to be run on Wednesday or the
present werk. The number of entries is
certainly remarkable, including nearly all
of the best hor.-es in training. The dis
tance is one rule, weights and declara
tions Tuesday, October 27. The nomina
tions are:
Sister Mary, Cash Day, Csesarion, St. Lee, All

ELECTION BETS.
An Eastern Commercial Man With
Plenty of Money to Wager on
McKinley.
Leon Dargin, a big-hearted, good-na
tured Eastern commercial man, for Col
lins, Downing & Co., New York, was
around town last night with Oscar Tolle,
the well-tcowii politician.
â¢'Where is this Bryan money?" Dargin
asked. "I thought tDÂ«re was some around
here, but I can't find it."
Dargin, it appears from his statement
and that of Tolle, has already invested
$19 000 on McKinley's election as against
$7000 on Bryan's.
"1 have got $20,000 more to put out at
the same odds," asserted the commercial
man.
Otherwise there is not much in the bet
ting line on election results.
Harry Corbett yesterday posted $500
against $400 on McKinley, and he is said
to hold $500 more of other people's money
to wager against $350 that Bryan carries
this State.
Cohn Bayley of Jones and Market streets
will take the $500 end of it against $400
that be is right in picking out McKinley
cc a winner.
VOTE FOR HONEST MEN.
So Says the Rev. Mr Gardner of the
West Side Church
At the West Side Christian Church last
night the pastor, Rev. W. A. Gardner,
spoke to his congregation on the subject
of the approaching Presidential election
and the sacred duty which the possession
of the franchise imposes upon every
citizen.
"When you step into the voting booth,"
he said, "and stand alone in the stall you
snould carefully consider where to place
your cross."
Incidentally he put in a good word for
woman's suffrage, which he considered
was not by any mÂ«an9 a party issue, while
with respect to the municipal elections he
earnestly urged nis hearers to pay no at
tention the Federal polit.es of any candi
date, but to vote for t> c best man. The
man who wouid sell bis vote to a corpor
ation, or for money favor a criminal, be
longed to Satan and should have no pare
in administering the affairs of a great
Nation.

CYCLERS' ROAD RACES.
Tue Alameda, Imp rial and Cali

Yesterday.
J. R. Kenna to Join the Bay Cilysâ
Garden City Cyclers' Meet
Postponed.
The vicinity of Haywards was the scene
of two very interesting road races yester
day, each having a iarge number of con
testants; but a strong head wind and the
poor condition of the course militated
against very fast time being made.
The first event was that of the Alameda
cyclers, a five-mile handicap, which was
started at 10 o'clock from San Leandio.
Twenty-four men started and nineteen
finished. First pluce went to George
Muther, who bad two minutes time allow

man, made best time, 13:13.

at 11 o'clock, there being twenty-six con
testants, of whom all but rive finished.
The most interest was attached to the rid
ing of the scratch men â Lind, Maack,
Cook and Bozio. The two former drew
away lrom the two latter riders and in
the finishing sprint Maack beat Lind out,

PRESSFEEDERS' UNION.
Its New Bate of Wages Will Go Into
Efl'ect To-Day.
In the early part of this year the San
Francisco Feeders' and Helpers' Union
No. 20 of the International Pressmen's
Protective Union was organized, and from
that lime to the present its members have
been quietly canvassing among the print
ing offices until now it has a membership
of 105. Of these twenty-five are girls.
While the union was smalt as to numbers
no efforts were made to regulate wages,
although that was one of the objects in
view when it was created. Now that the
body has some standing it nas btea de
cided to look to the regulating of rates.
At a special meeting held recently the
union established a rate of wages to take
effect to-day. Cylinder pressmen will de
mand $8 per week and $10 for platform
presses. No strike or trouble is antici
pated, and it is believed tbat the employ
ers will agree to tbe rate.
The last trouble between employers and
pressmen was with the Schmidt La bel Co
mpany, which occurred October 1, 1896. At
that time seventeen girls went out with
thÃ rest. Pressmen's Union No. 24 pro
vided for ttie girls until August 20 last, by
which time the strike was virtually lost.
This union has aecMed to give a grand
ball and donate the proceeds to the idle
girl preisfeedors who stood out with them
in the long strike. The date ol the ball ia
not yet seu

THE TRIP FROM FLORIDA
Journey Described by a Soldier
of the Third Artil
lery.
Plenty to Eat on the Wayâ All the
Strangers Are Delighted With
California.
The Third Artillery, U. S. A., Colonel
E. C. Bainbridge, is now settlin- down to
the pleasant yet active duty of garrisoning
the posts in San Francisco harbor. The
change from Florida and Louisiana to Cal
ifornia is generally accented as agreeable.
The Third is an excellent regiment. The
officers and enlisted men are American
soldiers of a high grade of intelligence,
and the regiment bids fair to win a high
place here in popular favor.
The soldiers of the Fifth Artillery re
gretted to leave this station. They ex
pressed the opinion freely t;.at in no other
city of the United Statas was a soldier
more highly respected and more cour
teously treated than in San Francisco.
Yesterday forenoon Battery I and de
tachments of Batteries H and L of the
Third Artillery arrived here. Battery I,
Captain H. C. Danes and Lieutenant C. W.
Foster, went to Angel Island. Battery H
went to the i'residio. The troops arriving
yesterday consisted of three officers and
seventy enlisted men.
An interesting description of the jour
ney by rail lrom Florida to San Francisco
has been written by Private Winn of
Battery G. The battery left Pensacola
October 16. coming over the L. E. N. rail
road and Southern Pacific, through
Mobile, New Orleans. Houston, San An
tonio, El Paso, Yuma, Los Angeles, Oak
land, and thence by steamer McDowell to
the Presidio of San Francisco.
The account says: "From orange groves
of Florida to the orange groves of Califor
nia we experienced a continual change of
climate and scenery. Between Mobile
and New Orleans we were within a few
miles of the Gulf of Mexico and, much to
our regret, missed the view. The country
is very low and marshy, much of tha road
being trestle. New Orleans, eight feet
beiow sea level, is the greatest shipping
point for cotton in the worid. Here you
will see sternwheel steamers packed to
the piiot-house with cotton landing at
levees and transferring cotton to ocean
steamers bound for foreign countries.
"Ai New Orleans we were transferred to
the Southern Pacific Railroad and fur
nished with -tourist sleepers, which added
to our comfort and enjoyment. At San
Antonio we were greeted by several hun
dred of the boys from Fort Sam Houston,
where cavalry, light artillery and infantry
are stationed. Light Battery F will join
us shortly at San Francisco."
The trip across tne desert of Arizona is
described in the narrative of the journey,
and record is also given ot the arrival in
Southern California and the delightful
run across mountains and through en
chanting valleys to San Francisco. In
closing the narrator says:
"We left Pensacola, Fia., at 11:15 p. m.
October 16, and arrived in San Francisco
October 22 at sp. M. We bad a pleasant
trip all through â plenty to eat and an
abundance of fruit. All are healthy and
happy and delighted with the change.
Good order and military discipline were
preserved. We are pleased with Califor
nia and t'lad to be here."
The enlisted men of the Fifth Artillery
who elected to remain in San Francisco
have been assigned to the various bat
teries of the Third Artillery.
First Lieutenant Robert H. Noble, First
Infantry, has been directed to join the
company at Benicia, to which he has been
tran slurred.
PARK PANHANDLE.
The Hedges on the Nor h and South
Sides Not to Be Disturbe.l.
"The resolution of the Board of Super
visors," said Superintendent McLaren of
Golden Gate Park," will have no effect on
the hedges that have been planted and are
growing on the north and south sides of
the panhandle. The hedge on the south
side are on the line of the inner edge of
the sidewalk, while the one on the north
tide i.9 on what would be the outer edge of
the sidewalk, but it is all within the park
limits. On that side there is a walk from
Baker to Btanyan street, and the territory
ia under the control of the Commissioners,
consequently the appearance of the pan
handle will not be destroyed.
"There are some people who object to
the hedge and want a stone wall substi
tuted, but they do not probably consider
that it wouid take a whole year's appro
priation to construct such a wall. The
hedges, in my opinion, serve the purpose
of keeping out the dogs and the stray cows,
and are much more picturesque than a
stone wall would be. Then, besides, it is
much cheaper."
One of the public schools of Germany,
the Nau-Ruppin gymnasium, has made it
obligatory on all its pupils to learn to
ride the bicycle.

NATIONAL GUARD
OF CALIFORNIA
Election Â£\"?airÂ£ engross so much of the
time and attention of officers and enlisted
men of the J'ational Guard that drills,
target scores au '<! skirmish firing are sec
ondary topics ol discussion. It is known
that the War Dep artment is soon to issue
new drill regulatic ns, and it is said that
much of the work .now known as the ex
tended - order drill, will be materialiy
changed. Therefore it is Jheld that time
employed In drills under the existing
tactics is time wasted. Many men of the
National Guard, as patriotic citizens, be
long to the uniformed political organiza
tions, and as the closing wtek of the cam
paign will be alive with, parades and
demonstrations it 13 proper that military
duties should be tempoi-arily relaxed.
This feeling is not restricted. to the Guards
men in San Francisco, but prevails
throughout the State.

I'il-st Jlriftade.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., Oct. 21.â
National Guard matters have been rather
quiet in this city for the past month. The
attendance at company drill has been very
good despite the fact that some of the big
political blowouts have been held on drill
nights.
The political high jinks came off last ;
Saturday night to a large and well-pleased j
audienceof men only. Republicans, Popo- j
crats, tramps. Prohibitioni-ts and the new j
woman made up t lie political part of the
show, together with 11 few liv:n : pictures
taken from the photographs of Max Bach
man's statuary now appearing in an East
ern publication. Sercear.ts Carter and
Bodkin and Private La Niece did some
very good work on the trapeze and hori
zontal bar, while Corporal Rait and Pri
vate Keyland wound up the evening's j
sport with a three-round sparring match!
that was a "hummer."
Company X, Seventh Infantry, will not
give its annual New Year's reception on
January 1. For six years the company
has kept open house on that day and each
year the crowd has been greater than the
year before, until it reached its climax
iast New Year's with a crowd that "was en
tirely too larce for comfort or pleasure.
This coming !N'ew Year's eve the company
will present the p!uy of "Rosedale; or, Tne
Rifle Ball," at the opera-house. The plays
given by the company in former years
have been very successful artistically and
in a financial way. In fact the company
possesses among its members and their
Jady friends some of the very best am
ateur talent in this part of the State. Miss
Lnwson, Miss Sloat and Miss Merideth,
who appeared to such advantage in "A"
latoona" and "Through the Lines, 7 ' wiil
be in the cast of "Rosedale" and will add
fresh laurels to those already won.
The regiment has a new lieutenant
colonel, and the selection of Colonel
Schrieber for the position meets the
hearty approval of every member of Com
pany X, as wan evidenced by the round of
hearty applause that greeted the mention
of hi3*name when the announcement was
made to the boys last Monday evening.
A rather mild sensation was created at
the election of the Heuteuant-colonel In
Los Angeles last Saturday night tlxat
promises to develop into a good-siz?d war.
When the presiding officer" announced
that by order of the general commanding
no officer would be permitted to attend
and participate in another election in this
regiment unless he appeared in a full
dress uniform, a rather blanlc look settled
upon the face of the officers present, und
more than one officer remarked that it was
about time for him to get out of the guard
if fuss and feathers was to be again made
an important j!>art of a soldier' 3 .luties. It
certainly seems strange that such an order,
should be issued at this time, when the
commanding officer must know that the
expenses of company officers are now far
greater than they sjiould be obliged to
bear. The undress uniform now worn by
officers certainly answers ail the require
ment of tbe service, and to force upon
them an extra expense ot $50 or $60 for a
uniform to be worn about once a year is a
hardship and expense that they should
not be asked to bear, and will only end in
forcing out of the service the most com
petent and efficient officers now in tne
guard.
An effort is now being made in Com
pany X to organize a baseball team. All
the necessary timber baa been found with
the exception of a pitcher, and no doubt
that place wiil he filled in a day or so.
Serjeant J. M. Carter is now in Los
Anceles where he will be joined by Private
La Niece in a few days. It is rumored that
they have secured an engagement at a
leading vaudeville theater as an acrobatic
song and dance team, but at this date the
rumor cannot be veritied.
Second Brigade.
Lieutenant E. S. Heller, Inspector of
Rifle Practice l r ifth Infantry, has been
granted leave of absence for ninety days
with permission to leave the State.
Bernard P. Judge is commissioned First
Lieutenant Company iJ. First Infantry,
with rank from August 24, 18aG, vice Mid
dleton, resigned.
Edwin F. Davis is commissioned Second
Lieutenant Company H. First Infantry,
with raiiK ff"oni August 24, 1896, vice West,
promoted.
F. Dohrmann, Jr., is re-elected Second
Lieutenant Company C, Fiflh Infantry,
with rank from July' 14, 1894.
Major Boxion's battalion, First Infan
try, had battalion drill last Saturday even
ing. Major Sime's battalion will drill this
evening.
It has been decided to defer the regi
mental rield day of the First Intantry un
til after the election. So many men are
?nga -ed in the active work of the present
political campaign that it is not deemed
desirable to take the regiment to the
country until elective duties are fulfilled.
The duty of a citizen to vote ana eet oth
Â»rs to vote is not neglected in the National
auard.
The campaign committee of the Second
Brigade Offirers' Association has done
some active work during the pnst week in
the lino of interviewing candidates for the
Legislature. In this work the committee
is not taking sides politically. The pur
pose of the committee is to inform the
candidates concerning the requirements
of the guard and point ont the fact that
the law contemplates that the guard shall
be equipped for active service.
Third 15rig>ide.
WOODLAX/D, Cat,., Oct. 23. -Being so
close to election activity in military circles
is not very brisk, but we hope that after
election it will pick up. Last evening a
squad of Company F, Second Infantry,
pave a fancy drill at the German fair now
being held in the armory. The move
ments, some of which were very difficult,
were executed in a manner that reflects
great credit upon the drill master. Captain
Prindle, and the boys that formed the
squad. The drill will be repeated again
on Saturday evening with a few extra
movements.
AVocdland is just waking up to the fact
that she has a good military company,
and many wore tiie praises bestowed upon
the boysfor last night's work.
Thecompany was drilled in the bayonet
exercise last Wednesday night for the
first time. Some of the members are very
proficient in this branch of the tactics and
acted as instructors. The boys soon got
onto the workings of the exercise and in a
short time Company Fwill be able to hold
its own in the bayonet drill as well as in
the other branches. Great credit is due
Captain Prindle for the solid footing upon
which thecompany now stands. He is a
never tiring worker and is ably seconded
by his iieutenants and also by his non
commissioned officers.
Tbe next social to be given by the com
pany will take place about Thursday even
ing, tbe 29th ot the present month. The
future success of these socials is now an
assured fact. Social I}', they are irre
proachable; financially, nearly the same.
A stone sidewalk is to be laid iv front of
the armory immediately after election.
Several other improvements are also con
templated to be done at the same time.
The 500-yard rr.nge has not been selected
as yet, but when tbo election excitement
has subsided and the town regains its
normal condition it will be attended to.
Then look out for some first-class long
range shooting. The regular meeting
night still remains the same. Visiting
militiamen are welcome at any and all
limes.
VISALIA, Cat-., Oct. 22.â Affairs in
Company H., Sixth Infantry, are flourish
ing. Six new members have been enlisted,
and, although the political campaign
somewhat interferes with the regular drills
this month, great interest is being main
tained both at drill and at the target. At
the monthly competition for the Berry
driii medal* Sergeant Spier won. Major
Berry and wife were in attendance at the
drill "and were greaUy pleased with the
line showing the company made nud the
precision with which the manual of arras
and evolutions of the company were per
formed. Sergeant Mixter, wno has won
the medal four times and is no longer
eligible to compete for it, drilled the com
pany. Captain Ward and Lieutenant
Adams were judges.
Last Friday evening the company gave
the first of a series of social hops and en
tertainments, which they will give
-monthly. A really line musical pro
gramme of six nuiobers was rendered,
aftor which dancing was indulged in until
1 o'clock.
Dainty refreshments were served in one
of the company rooms adjoining the drill
hall. Over eighty conple were in attend
ance on the main floor, and the gallery
was packed with nearly 400 spectators.
Every one acknowledged this to be one of
the pleasantest and niost. successful parties
ever given in Visalia. T*hese hops are to
be strictly military, and all members of
thecompany and visiting military people
attended in full dress uniform. Lieuten
ant Carson of Troop I, Fourth Cavalrj-,
wi* in attendance.
Sunday evening Captain and Mrs. Ward
gave a musicale at their residence in
honor of Lieutenant Carson. A fine mu
sical programme was rendered and re
iresbments were served.
Monday evening Captain If. J. Byrnes
and wife arranged ami chaperoned a very
pleasant theater rarty. Six young couples,
including Misses Jessie >'auscarven, Carrie
Weathers aud Sadie Brittain, and Lieu
tenant Carson, Lieutenant Adams and Dr.
I'arr, assembled at the Byrnes residence
:md then attended the theater together.
After the performance an elaborate supper
was discussed.
Lieutenant Carson made arrangements
while here 10 secure a camping ground
for the cavalry troops to locate and camp
on for eight or ten days while on their
homeward march. They will probably
camp o;i the . grounds occupied by the
Company E shooting range and will pnt in
their time by hard drill in order to enable
them to catch up in evolutions of lhÂ£
company and squadron which they have
been unable to do while in the mountains
this summer. The local infantry company
"will probably drill with them often during
their stay here in the extended order and
in outpost duties for both arms of the ser
vice and they expect to be greatly benefited
by the experience.

OLD PEOPLE'S HOME.
Sixth Memorial Service TesterdayâAd
dress by Key. It. Mackenzie, IÂ». I).
The sixth annual memorial service of
the Crocker Old People's Home, corner of
! Pierce and Pine streets, was held ia the
I chapel of that institution yesterday after
; noon.
The large and representative congrega
tion which crowded the interior to the j
i doors showed with unmistakable clearness
i that the philanthropic object of the home j
!is widely recognized and appreciated |
among all denominations. Many of tbe
I City clergy were present, as also the ma
: jority of the members of the board of
: trustees, the boatd of lady managers and
, the following members of the Crocker |
: family: Colonel Fred Crocker, Mr. and 1
! Mrs. George Crocker, Charles Crocker and
j hie mother, C. F. Crocker and Mrs. A.
1 Easton. The chapel was tastefully dec
! orated w'tta flowers and foliage â the gift
! of numerous friends and patrons of the
I institution.
The superintendent and chaplain. Rev.
Charles McKelvey, was assisted in the
conduct of the service by Revs. F. H.
j Willey, D.D., O. C. Miller, W. H. More
j land and Robert Mackenzie, D.D.
The latter delivered the annual address,
: in which he said that great things per
] fected were liut the aggregate of little i
i thines, and that the Old People's Home
j itself was the aggregate of many littiÂ«s. j
j He spoke in eulogistic terms of the noble |
i work accomplished by the ladies associ
! ated with the home and feelingly referred
I to the recent decease of its founder, Mrs.
i Charles Nelson, who had acted as presi
j dent of the board of management for no
! less than twenty-one years.
The chaplain supplemented tbe address
wftb a few brief remarks, mainly devoted
;to the same tbetne. The balance of the
1 afternoon's programme was composed of j
: the following selections in addition to the j
I prayers and scriptural lessons of the day:
i "Gloria 111 Excelsis," choir; chant, "Tha

Improvements That Have
Been Brought About by
United Efforts.
Pdk â¢ Street Property â¢ Owners
Want That Thoroughfare
Cut Through.
THE NEW JEWISH HOSPITAL.
List ot the More Important Transfers
That Have Been Recorded
During the Week.
The most notable event in City real estate
matters during the past week was the lighting
of Polk street, so fittingly celebrated Saturday
night. This was brought about by the ener
getic efforts of a few of the more enterprising
property-owners and merchents on that thor
ouglniire, who recently organized themselves
into an improvement club. Among other im-
Drovements projected by this club is the ex
tension of Polk street through me Union
street hill north to the bay.
There scarcely is a section of San Francisco
that does not b?ar unmistakable evidence of
substantial improvements brought about this
season through the agency of an improvement
club. Improvements that may be traced di
rectly to such organizations are the bituminiz
ingof Folsom street, the lighting and exten
sive grading in the Potrero and the extensive
improvements of Castro, Fairmount, Sunny
side, Laktview, Ashbury Heights and JRlch
mond districts.
REVIEW OF THE RECORDS.
There were ninety-five deeds pieced on rec
ord during the past week. No tiansfers of any

CANVAS DIRECT
FROM THE SKY
Farmer Enos' Answer to
Prayer Ends in a
Charge of Theft.
Was Not Sent From Heaven,
but Was Cast Adrift by
an Aeronaut
HE MUST HOW GO TO COURT.
Balloonist Vosmer's Unique Experi
ence While Trying to Recover
His Machine.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Oct, 25. j
Joseph Enos is the proprietor of a ranch
near Lone Tree Cemetery. He is a very
devout man and during the hard times of
the past three years he has been forced to
place his trust in Providence, because he
could not find many human beings either
trustworthy or willing to trust. Recently
Farmer Enos supplicated fervently for
the way to be opened by which he might
procure enough canvas on which to spread
out his crop of horse-beans.
Last evening, just before suoper time,
Enos was electrified to see something de
scending right onto his ranch direct from
heaven. As it came rapidly toward the
earth Enos saw that it was a large bundle
of canvas â just what he had been praying
for. It landed right at Enos' feet and he
at once saw ample facilities for doing tbe
very best possible for his bean crop. Enos
at once proceeded to gather it up and de
cided that so long as his gift had come
direct from heaven it would not be sacri
legious to spread it out on the Sabbath
and take the first turn out of his horse
beans.
Farmer Enos then went into the honse
and acquainted his family with his good
fortune. He had barely completed his
story when an athletic young fellow
rushed up to the ranch and seeing the
heap of canvas at once laid claim to it.
Enos protested. It had fallen straight
from the clouds on to his ranch and was
his by right of eminent domain, there
.being no title deeds to anything that came
irom the sky.
Then the stranger, whose name was Vos
mer, told his story. There had been a Dal
loon ascension that afternoon at the bar
becue and Vosrner had bade adieu to his
balloon at a height of a mile or so above
the earth and had departed with his para
chute, at the same time making a mental
date with the balloon when he should find
it. This did not satisfy Farmer Enos, who
is not posted in aeronautics, and Vosnier
had to return without his balloon.
Tne balloonist at once swore out a war
rant against Enos, and the latter will be
brought into court to-mcrrow morning.
Vosnier had another engagement to-day
for his balloon and was forced to forego it
and he declares that he will also sue Enos
for damages.
LIST TEST OF THE SITE
Examinations of the New Post
oifice Lot Are Almost
Completed.
Results Declared by the Government
Engineer to Be Entirely-
Satisfactory.
Another crumb of satisfaction for those
citizens who are awaiting the completion
of a new postoffice is almost ready to be
digested. For over a month Civil En
gineer Moran of this City, working under
the direction of United States engineers,
has been probing and experimenting in
the soil at the corner of Mission and
Seventh streets to ascertain just what was
underneath the surface which would war
rant the erection of a massive structure.
In the pursuit of these investications a
Stationary engine and a force of men have
been engaged in pumping and digging
and the residents in the neighborhood
have wondered at the stream of muddy
water which was conveyed in a trougn
across the sidewalk. A high board fence
shuts out the gaze of the curious and pad
locked gates repell the intrusion of
investigators.
Just what there is in the operations that
warrants such seclusion is not apparent,
though it was explained that the work
men were greatly aunoyed with junk
seekers, who took every available oppor
tunity to enter the inclosure and carry
away such available articles as are port
able.
Engineer Moran explained that the
presence of so much water was not un
expected or unsatisfactory. "We struck
water at twelve feet," he said, "about the
usual depth of surface water hereabout."
The results, he said, had been in every
way satisfactory. No mud had been en
countered, nothing but sand, and sand
was the kind of a surtace that is desired.
There have been four test holes dug to the
depth of sixteen feet, the proposed depth
of the foundation. The work has been
necessarily slow on account of the water
which the men encountered at twelve feet.
From that down the pump had to be kept
constantly at work to allow the men to
dig, and even then it was painlul labor
lifting out the mud and water.
Upon the completion of the present
tests, which will probably be in a short
time, a report will be made to the United
Slates Engineer.
ARION IN THE AIR.
The Wonderful Feat of an Artist on a
Live Trolley Wire.
Arion, the wonderful man who walks
on a t.ght wire at a dizzy height, made
his first appearance at tbe Haight-street
grounds yesterday in the presence of a
large number of people. This individual,
who has on a wire crossed over Niagara
Falls twelve times, gave an exhibition of
his skill at an elevation of sixty-nine feet
above tbe lake. He walked on a 2UO-foot
stretch of wire with as much ease as if he
were on a 3idewaik; walked with a basket
on his feet; then encased himself in a
large grain sack, and walked in that man
ner, after which he carried a large bundle
on his back. When midway between the
platforms be opened this, which consisted
of mattress, pillows and blanket. At the
dizzy height he made up a bed, covered
mmseif with the blanket, and laid down at
full length, apparently as contented as if
he were on a hundred-doiUr bedstead. It
was a wonderful feat of balancing. In ad
dition, he did some trapeze work on the
wire and hung by his toes. In the even
ing he repeated the performances, and
supplemented them by riding on a live
trolley wire with a grooved-wheel bicycle.
He and the wheel were illuminated with
seventy-live electric lights of various
colors, the effect being startling and mag
nificent. The act was a pretty one to ob
serve, but extremely risky, and one that
not many would care to undertake.
POLITICS EVERYWHERE.
There Is No Escape, Not Even by the
Sad Sea Waves.
There were thousands of people who
went to the ocean beach yesterday in the
hope that they might enjoy a few hours of
rest from the din of politics that is to be
heard in the City; but great was their dis
appointment. On every side their eyes
were greeted with immense posters an
nouncing the candidacy of some one anx
ious to fill an office. Politicians occupied
the roads leading to the Cliff and on the
balconies of the Cliff House they were as
thick as delegates at a National conven
tion, and they were busy buttonholing
every one they could and advancing the
merits of the respective individuals they
advocated. There was no escape from
politics for those who sought to have a
short rest.
There was a good attendance at the
baths and much fun was created by the
amphibous act of Cornell and Empey, il
lustrative of "Farmer Hayseed beaten by
a bunco-steerer by means of tee gold brick
trick." Dave Thompson gave a fine exhi
bition of high, fancy and trapeze diving,
and Cornell and Empey performed the
mystifying drown act in a manner so clever
as to win for them much auplause.
UNION SOAPMAKERS.

Soapmakers' Union recently the following

HE LIFTED THE PANEL
How Mr. Bouton's Visitor Last
Sunday Entertained Him
self.
He Went Through Every Nook in
the House and Overlooked a
Large Sum of Money.
Last Sunday afternoon a burglar called
at 217 Thirteenth street, the residence of
Superintendent Hart Bouton of the Le
Grand Laundry. He found the family
out, but this did not deter him from mak
ing a pleasant stay of it, and he doubtless
went away well satisfied with his social
venture. The doors were inhospitably
locked when ne arrived, but he pried a
back window on the ground floor up, tear
ing out the strong screw with which it
was fastened, and easily let himself into
The Lifted Panel.
the dining-room. Then he carefully went
through that department and its closets,
spreading the articles which he cared to
examine out on the table.
All of the doors leading from this room
he found locked, but he did not mind that
and tackled one of them with his good
jimmy. He split a large splinter off the
door near the lock, Dut, the faithful bolt
resisted him and he went for one of the
lower panels. This was soon ocened. mak
ing as nice a square hole as the heart of a
burglar could wish.
The rest was easy sailing, and the vis
itor took in every room at his leisure.
Nothing escaped his close scrutiny from
cellar to garret. Trunks, bureaus, boxes
and shelves were overhauled and even the
bed clothing of all the sleeping apart
ments were neaped on the floor. Pockets
of wearing apparel were turned inside out,
and even the furniture of the kitchen was
overhauled. Then he went out by the
front door, leaving it wide open.
When Mrs. Bouton returned she hardly
knew her house, but soon missed
jewelry and small articles cf value
that had departed with the burglar.
Notwithstanding his care he missed quite
a large sum of money that only escape',

JAPAN'S NEW WARSHIPS.
Commander N'arita Think* the Union
Iron Works Will Be Favored.
Among the arrivals from the Orient
yesterday in the unexpectedly early Coptic
was a party of Japanese consisting of Com
mander K. Narita of the imperial Japanese
navy; S. Uchida, Japanese Consul, on his
way to New York ; Y. Wooyeno, also
bound for the New York legation, and T.
lida, a merchant of Japan.
Commander Narita saw service in the
late Japanese-Chinese war, and is particu
larly interested now in the further devel
opment of Japan's navy. He says that he
feels almost sure that the Union Iron
Works will receive a contract for some of
the new warships contemplated by his
Government, though nothing official has
yet come from the naval department.
All the members of the party are enthu
siastic silverites and are opposed to Mc-
Kinley and his protective policy.
Died in the Hospital.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, OCTOBER 26, 1896.
A. F. Lejeal, a Talented Composer*
Alois F. Lejeal's new mass (No. 5), unpublished, but ]ust finished, was rendered
yesterday at the Church of Notre Dame dcs Victoires. The music world of this City
was on hand to hear tbe maestro's effort, and agrees with the lay circle that it is his
best work and entitled to pre-eminence anywhere.
It is for solo, quartet and chorus, which is better understood as "in four parts."
The Kyrie opens quietly and tbe chorus comes to a climax. The movement of
Christe Eleison is worked out thematically. This is followed by a tenor solo and ends
with a quartet, the first movement being repeated and ending with a coda.
The Gloria, in B flat major, is a spirited movement in two-half time.
At the Et in Terra Pax the key changes to G flat major and eventually returns to
the original key, when the Laudamus Te is taken up.
The Gratias Agimus is presented first with a duet for soprano and alto in G minor,
followed by a short tenor solo and a somewhat dramatic soprano rendition.
The Qui Tollis is a massive movement for the bassos to which the other voices re
ply. The Quoniam opens in the bassos with a theme in three-founh time, poco
vivace, which is worked up thematically through all the voices.
The Cum Bancto brings a new theme which the tenors tase up, and is also repeated
and brought to a climax in tbe Amen by the other voices.
The Credo enters with the strong chorus and some dramatic movement leading a
descending chromatic scale to the Et Incarnatus Est, a soprano solo with |slow Jmeas
ure, the chorus coming in at the Crucifixus, the whole ending with a quartet modula
tion in pianissimo.
The Et Resurrexit consists of a vivace movement in three-quarter time which
also contains some thematic woric.
The Et in Spiritum Sanctum is presented as a basso solo and is followed by an
alia capella movement for voices without accompaniment. The close of tbe Credo is
made by a chorus in the original vivace movement.
An Aye Maria, written independently from the mass, was rendered by Edgar
Atkinson and William Nielsen to a cello obligato by Mr. Gutterson. This creditable
piece was an unusual combination of barytone and basso.
The Sanctus, in D major, maestoso, works up pianissimo to the Pieni, which is
perfectly martial in its force.
The Benedictus, in G major, is a duo for soprano and tenor, a suave movement
with responsive features.
Agnus Dei opens with an alto solo in B flat minor, followed by a short Tuti on the
end where comes in the Miserere Nobis chorus, and then the duet for soprano and
alto.
Dona Nobis closes the mass. It is a somewhat lively movement in B flat major, in
which is presented a trio for soprano, alto and tenor. The bassos and tenors take
the final theme with responses from the other voices, and the conclusion is given with
a theme taken from the Kyrie movement with which the mass is opened.
In anticipation of the great musical treat in store for them, the usual attendance
at the Sunday service was greatly increased by the musically inclined.
The artists who rendered the music were:
Sopranosâ Miss Florence Garrissere, Miss C. Cooney, Miss Adele RottanzJ, Miss Sylvia
Rottanzi, Mrs. L. Valerga; altosâ Miss Anna Grozilliere, Miss N. O'Rourke, Miss E. Johnson,
Miss Irene G. Mull; tenorsâ James B. Lane, Bank Somers, David R. Wise, Louis Van der
Mehden; bassosâ John McAuliffe, Wilhelm Nielsen, William Stadtfeld, Edgar Atkinson, F.
Bonrnizeau, H. R. Basford. Oreanist, Sigismund Martinez.

pied the chair. State Labor Commis
sioner Fitzgerald and his chief deputy,

The committee on resolutions reported
it had met Thursday evening and consid
ered various laws. Bill 2, providing
for the proper sanitary ;condition of
bakeries ani the preservation of health
of bakers, referred Dack to the committee,
was presented . with an amendment, as
follows:
For the purpose of enforcing the provisions
ot this act the Labor Commissioner shall ap
point a bakeshop inspector, who shall be a
practical journeyman baker, whose term of
office and powers shall be tne same and ou the
same conditions nnd who shall receive tne
same compensation as Deputy Labor Commis
sioners authorized by section 11 oi an act en
titled An act to establish and support a labor
bureau.
The bill was further amended by insert
ing in the title, after "bakeries," the
words "hotels and public restaurants,"
and "providing for the appointment of a
bakehouse inspector."
The amendments were adopted, with a
suggestion by the Labor Commissioner
that the 1 inspector be empowered to issue
a certificate to the owner of a bakery that
is conducted in compliance with all pro
visions of the act; but where orders are
issued by the inspector to improve tbe
condition of a bakery no such certificate
shall be issued until such orders and the
provisions of the act shall have been com
plied with. This, too, was incorporated,
and then the biil as a whole was adopted.
Bill 4, an act to provide for a bond
for the protection of laborers upon public
work, was laid over awaiting the opinion
of the Attorney-General, which, Labor
Commissioner Fitzgerald said, would be
reaiiy for the next meeting.
Bill 8, an act to add to the Political
Code of California two new sections regu
lating the hours of labor in bakeries, was
aJso laid over for the Attorney's opinion.
The proposed act to provide lor branding
all articles manufactured in prison stirred
the convention considerably. The Labor
Commissioner announced that the presi
dent oi the Prison Commission had filed
his report with the Governor, but would
be glad to make a supplemental report
containing suggestions from tbe conven
tion upon this question.
Delegate Macarthur protested that the
bill only legalized prison-made goods, and
he held that prisons should manufacture
nothing for public use. The convicts, he
said, should be compelled to cultivate the
land about the prisons to produce food for
their support,
P. 11. McCarthy argued that It was a
serious question. Even in the Affiliated
Colleges fontracts there were indications
that convict granite will be used. A dele
gate from the Granite-cutters' Union spoke
against permitting convicts in California
State prisons to manufacture granite.
The Labor Commissioner suggested that
a committee be appointed by the conven
tion to confer with the Prison Commis
sioners. ''It is impossible," said he, "to
make a brand that will distinguish prison
made articles coming from other States.
A silk thread in cloth is said to be a bratm,
but you cannot see it. At San Qaentin a
strip of red in the jute bags is a brand of
convict-made goods, but few people know
that fact. The only way to deal with this
question is to brand the place that sells
convict goods, 'Prison-made goods sold
here. 1 "
Macarthur moved that a committee of
rive be appointed in comorinity with the
suggestion of Fitzgerald, and also to con
fer with the Manufacturers' and Pro
ducers' Association.
This committee will consider the pro
posed bill in conference with the Prison
Commissioners and Manufacturers' Asso
ciation. It is as follows: John Grant,
Guy Lathrop, George Lafayette, T. Kealy
and W. Macarthur.
Bill 11,, which provides for the remis
sion of costs in Justices' courts in actions
to recover for personal servicos. was
adopted without amendment. The same
action was taken upon a proposed act "to
prevent collusion between employers of
labor and employment agents."
The convention was bad.'y divided in its
views upon bill 13, which provided for
the employment of citizens oi the United
States upon public works wiihin tnis
State. Delegate Furnseth of the Coast
Seamen's Union moved that the whole
bill be Btricken out on the ground that it
was unjust to honest labor. O*her dele
gates spoke in favor of the law because it
would preclude aliens from State employ
ment. The opposition maintained that
no law should be introduced that might
split up labor. In the debate ensuing
amendments to the motion and a motion
on the recommendation of the committee
on resolutions created a tangle. Furuseth's
motion was lost, and the bill was eventu
ally referred back to the committee to
submit to the Attorney-General for his
opinion upon a recent decision of tbe New
York Supreme Court declaring the same
law uncoustitutional.
Bill 14, an act to provide for a lunch
hour for employes, was stricken out, as
the convention concluded that it could not
be enforced.
Bill 15, an act to provide for the
protection of life and property against in
secure steam boilers, and lor the establish
ment of a system of inspection of steam
boilers and for the licensing of en
gineers and boiler attendants was in
indorsed, with the proviso that the word
"Union" be retained in qualifying boiler
makers.
The convention adopted bill 16, an
act providing for the payment of employes
upon discharge or resignation from ser
vice, rejecting No. 17. an act to Drevent
blacklisting of employes.
The last bill, No. 18, providing for costs
in actions for the price of labor or services
was amended to include all firms and em
ployers, and then adopted.
The convention adjourned until, next
Thursday to then take ud the recommen
dations of the State Attorney-General.
IS "PINK-EYE"
EPIDEMIC HERE?
Disease of Human Optics
Which Has Recently-
Appeared.
Oculists Say From What They
Hear It Seems Like a,
Recognized Trouble.
LOCAL CASES ARE FEW.
But in Other Parts of the Stats the
Affliction Has Taken Large
Proportions.
A painful disease of the eyes has made
its appearance in this City. Some observers
believe it to be a new disease to this City.
On the other hand oculists and specialists
on eye diseases think that it is not new.
Half a dozen oculists said that they had
not yet seen one case of the complaint,
but from the symptoms, as they were de
scribed, they all felt sure that the malady
is not novel.
One oculist said that probably the com
plaint is what has been popularly styled
"pink eye," froru its resemblance to the
malady which afflicts horses and other an
imals, and which is generally so desig
nated. There have been many cases in
parts of Sonoma County. An epidemic
existed in the town of Sonoma not long
ago. The first cases observed in this City
have been noticed within the past few
days. These have not been numerous bo
far.
The speed with which the disease spread
through Sonoma County is significant con
cerning what may happen in this City.
Whole lamilies have been afflicted in the
town of Sonoma and perhaps in other
communities in the Sonoma Valley. The
attendance at schools has been interfered
with largely. At one time it was supposed
that a victory had been won over the
troublesome complaint. Then one child
had sore eyes. A child sitting next in
school soon had the old trouble. Notwith
standing extreme care and the taking of
many precautions a whole family of chil
aren had it one after another.
The duration varies from a tew days to
two or three months, according to the se
verity of the case, and also according to
the treatment. The eyes become inflamed
and copiously suppurate. An intense
pain is felt and the eyes seem ready to
start from their sockets. This lasts for a
long time, without intermission unless
remedies are piomptly used. In Sonoma
County a tonic for the system was admin
istered by the local physicans and an eye
salve was applied to the inflamed lids with
good result.
Great care is necessary to prevent the
spread of contagion. Tnis ought to be un
derstood because there is little reason to
suppose that tbe malady will spread less
rapidly here than it has in the Sonoma
Valley. Oculists recall that an epidemic
of a similar sort passed over the Pacific
Const some years ago. The disease was
about the same as pink-eye. Western
communities, by this being meant fhe
towns and cities of the middle Western
States, have been extensively afflicted.
Owing to the fact that the appearance of
the eye trouble in this City has been only
recently observed the eye specialists have
no knowledge of it more than from hear
say.
Dr. Barkan said that he had not had any
cases. His assistants at the Cooper Medi
cal College had not reported any. He did
not know that there is gn epidemic. There
is a possibility of contagion* Probably the
disease is not new to this coast. There
may be a catarrhal affection of the con
junctiva. There are several catarrhal ail
ments. One is known as spring catarrh.
It is contagious. Further than this Dr.
Barkan did not care to speak until he
should have received further information.
Grant Sellfndge, who has an office in the
Croclcer building, said at once that the
malady must resemble what is commonly
called ''pink-eye," from its resemblance to
the illness which affects animals. There
might be an epidemic yet. The malady
could not have become epidemic in this
City yet, because the oculists have no re
ports concerning it, so far as he could
learn. No one had previously reported a
case to him.
Dr. Kaspar Pischl said that ho had not
received any report concerning this eye
trouble, but he did not believe that any
new disease had been discovered.
This is a fair summary of what was said
by other oculists. Meanwhile a few men
downtown are eoing around with sore
eyes, and form a nucleus from which an
epidemic may arise.
GOOD MINES IN MEXICO
A Large Amount of American
Capital Flowing In for
Investment.
Ex-Assemblyman Mack on the Poor
Corn Crop and Finding of
Minerals.
Ex- Assemblyman P. H. Mack of Inyo
County, who is engaged in some large
mining enterprises in Mexico, is at the
Russ. Mr. Mack is mining at Guanajuato,
an old city of 60,000 inhabitants, a thou
sand miles below Â£1 Paso, in the State of
Guanajuato.
"I have been going to that part of Mex
ico now for many months,' 1 said Mr. Mack
Wednesday. "There are a lot of good mines
there, including both silver and gold. A
large amount of capital is gome in from
many different parts of the United States,
and the country is unusually prosperous.
There have been bad crops in several of
the Mexican States, however, and corn,
which is the principal crop, has to a large
extent been a failure.
"Because of this, American corn is al
lowed to go into two of these States free
of duty. In these States mere has been al
most no corn crop. There is a good deal of
poverty among the common people. It is
estimated that there are 6,000,000 poor
people in Mexico, but the larger share of
them are Indians who have always been
poor, and some natives who have been
poor and whose ancestors have been poor
for many generations.
"In spite of this poverty, however,
Mexico is more prosperous now than it
ever has been. The capital that is coming
in for investment there is helping the
country out in a great many ways. It is
lubricating things and making times bet
ter for everybody.
"I consider Mexico a remarkably good
country for enterprising men to make
money in. The Governor of the State
where I am is a very capable man, and he
is looking after the interests of the people
in a way that is highly creditable to
him."
Mr. Mack will be here until after the
election.
