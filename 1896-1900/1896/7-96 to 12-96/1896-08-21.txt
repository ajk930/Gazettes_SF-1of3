MEET IN STATE CONVENTION.
i
One Spectator Shonts for the Boy
Orator and Is Promptly
Ejected.
LOUISVILLE, Kx.,Aug. 20.â The Sound
Money Democrats of Kentucky met in
State convention in Music Hall this after
noon and night, and amid great enthusi
asm adopted a platform embodying their
viewg, named delegates to the convention
at Indianapolis, selected State officers,
formed an organization to carry on tne
campaign, and indorsed ex-Governor Buck
ner for the nomination for Vice- President.
Nearly every leading Democrat in the
State was present. The big hall was
jammed. Ex-Governor Buckner entered
the hall just before the convention was
called to order, and he was given a rousing
reception. After a prayer by Rev. Dr.
Hemphill, ex-Lieutenant-Governor Hind
man was elected temporary chairman. His
speech of thanks was followed by a loud
demand for ex-Congressman W. C. P.
Breckinrid-je, who sat on the stage
with his wife. The silver-tongued orator
came to the front of the stage and the
convention went wild. Mr. Breckin
ridge's speech was a great oratorical
triumph. He began by saying that he
could not stand by the Chicago platform
nor support the nominee. He felt no
worse when he was drivÂ«n into the Con
federate army to maintain his convictions
thau he did now, wnen he was driven into
opposition to the regular nominees of his
party. He was a Democrat from convic
tion, and had been so all his life, but he
joined with the best and greatest men of
the party to put it upon a secure basis.
The last time be had spoken in Louisville
fie had predicted tne election of Cleve
land. After the Chicago convention he
looked forward upon years of struggle,
but he believed the party would come out
triumphant and purified. He had helped
reorganize the party. He knew what it
was to go to defeat. He had won a vic
tory that carried with it the seeds of its
own destruction. The Democratic party
of 1892 was a heteregeneous collection and
it was now leaping the reward of its in
sincerity.
He referred to the greenback craze and
said no party deserved victory nor de
i-erved life wh n it became dishonest. For
the third time the Democratic party of
Kentucky had the opportunity to immor
talize itself. Now Kentucky, the first State
Convention to be held since the Chicago
convention, would rise and demonstrate
the eternal principles npon which the
Democratic party was founded. It was a
rare honor that all this party had gone
through was to fit it for this occasion.
Kentucky Democrats stood now to plead
with the Nation, to maintain the position
which the fathers of the party had taken
to insist npon public and private honesty,
and the observance of the laws.
"Our remedy for wrongs is not by an
archy, not by riots, but by peaceful
means," said the colonel. We do believe
in a paternal Government; we don't believe
in the purchasing of 177,000 miles of rail
roads with the taxes of the people The
result of the Populistic platform would be
utter destruction. We wiil not walk
in the road ihe St. Louis and Chicaeo con
ventions point out. You need not tell me
it is a regular Democratic nomination.
Walk not into that cesspool. Ido not dis
pute the regularity of the Chicago conven
tion, but it had no power to pledge Demo
crats to hostile measures. We do not
obey that convention. It is not Demo
cratic because it wore the Democratic
robes. It is the hand of Esau, but we
recognize the voic* of Jacob. We are not
a blind Isaac, and we recognize the voice
of the masquerading Jacob arid we decline
to go that way. The heart of Kentucky is
with us. We were a sound-money State
years ago. We lost through want of vigi
lance and cowardly leaders, and we almost
became reconciled to free silver. But we
did not look forward to a platform in
which the best thing in it is the free silver
plank."
Bryan, he said, was an undeveloped and
emotional yonng fellow. He thought
Bryan believed in his platform and would
try to make that the law of the land.
Speaking for himself alone he believed the
election of Bryan would be the greatest
calamity that could happen to the people.
The duty of the Democratic party was to
defeat the election of Bryan. That accom
plished they would Keep open the old
Democratic home for the reception of
thoae who having been misled desire to
return thither. They would be received
with open arras and nobody would say to
them "I told you so." He regarded this
day as an eventful one and this grand con
vention of Democrat* one that would -live
in political history.
Just as Colonel Breckinridge was bring
ing his speech to a close a spectator in the
rear of the hall yelled, "Hurrah for
Bryan !" amid cries of "Throw him out!"
Tne police escorted the Bryan enthusiast
through the door. Colonel Breckinridge
asked them to let the disturber alone and
closed with a plea for money good the
world over and for a tariff for revenue
only.
After the transaction of minor business
the convention adjourned at 4:15 to 5:15
o'clock, when the body reassembled and
heard reports from committees, soon tak
ing another recess until 7:30 o'clock.
Judge Quincy Ward of Paris was chosen
permanent chairman just before the last
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL
adjournment. He took the chair when
tne convention reassembled at 7:40 o'clock.
A. J. Carroll of Louisville, ex-Governor
Buckner, W. O. P. Breckinridge of Lex
ington and W. F. Browder of Russellville
were ctosen as delegates from the State at
large to Indianapolis. The rol lcall showed
that 114 out of the 119 counties were rep
resented in the convention.
The report of the committee on resolu
tions was adopted unanimously. After
indorsine the teachings of Jefferson, Jack
son, Benton, Tilden and Cleveland, the
report demands a currency measured by
the existing gold standard and whic.i shall
consist of gold with a bank currency wel!
secured and redeemable in gold, and with
the use of silver and other metals within
the reasonable limit presented by con
venience and safety and to be kept at par
with gold. A tariff for revenue only is
demanded, and it is believed to be the
duty of the Government to protect the
citizen and his property from lawlessness.
The recent convention at CLicago and
its platform and candidates are disclaimed
as un- Democratic. Bryan is declared to
be a Populist and Sewall a subsidized ship
builder and a high protectionist. The ad
ministration of Grover Cleveland and
John G. Carlisle is indorsed and the CLi
cago convention condemned for its refusal
to take similar action.
The references to Cleveland and Carlisle
were greeted with thunders of applause.
On motion of Coionel Breckinridee the
delegates to Indianapolis were instructed
to vote for ex-Governor Simon Bolivar
Buckner for Vice-President as long as
they deemed it advisable.
Governor Buckner was called to the
stage, while the band played "See, the
Conquering Hero Comes." He made a
stirring speech. Be said he bad deter
mined to retire from politics, but in a case
like this old and young must do their duty
alike.
R. T. Tyler of Paducah and Judge J. Q.
Ward of Paris were named as electors at
large.
The convention adjourned at 11:03.
MAY COST BRYAN DEARLY.
Important Results to Follow the Fusion
in Idaho.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Aug. 20.â The
announcement in the dispatches from
Idaho that the Democrats and Populists
of that State are going to enter into
fusion, leaving silvpr Republicans out, is
important and a matter of great concern
to Democrats. Ii this course is decided on
by the Democrats of Idaho it is contrary
to the plans of the Democratic managers,
and if it is followed is likely to resuit in the
loss to Bryan of a number of so-called
silver States which have been counted on
confidentially by the Democrats. It will
go far beyond the limits of Idaho. Dubois
and Teller are men on whom Democrats
depend to draw the Western silver Re
publican vote to Bryan, so as to make it
rossible for him to carry several of the far
Western States. The Democrats are com
paratively a small faction in these States
and silver Republicans were depended on
to give Bryan the States. The failure of
tbe Democrats in Idaho to act in good
faith with Dubois is apt to alienate almost
the entire silver RepuDlican vote ol that
section of the country. It will not end with
Idaho, but will extend into all silver-pro
ducing States, and even into Illinois,
where Dubois' influence is almost the only
potential factor in holding what Republi
can silver men there are there to the sup
port of Bryan.
The action of the Idaho Democratic
Convention, which is probably correctly
reported, is regarded as the most serious
blow Bryan has experienced. Dubois,
quite as much as Teller, is the leader of
the silver men who were relied on to make
Bryan's election possible. Recently he
captured a large majority of the Republi
can primaries in that State, turning them
over to Bryan. Senator Shoup, with his
following, preserves the Republican or
ganization for McKiniey. It is believed
here the action of the Democrats will drive
Republicans back to the leadership of
Shoup and give McKiniey the State, l!
this proves true the reaction will probably
spread into Montana, Utah, Colorado, all
Pacific Coast States and Illinois, and will
throw a damper on the boltin â  Republican
silver movement in South Dakota, Michi
gan and Minnesota.

Chairman Jones and Assistants Rave
Plenty of Work Ahead..
CHICAGO. 111., Aug. 20.â Chairman
Jones, Judge Johnson of Kansas and
Daniel J. Campau of Michigan, members
of the Democratic National Campaign
Committee, arrived to-day at the Sherman
House to begin the campaign work for
Bryan and Sewall from the Chicago head
quarters. Ex-Congressman Towle will act
as chief clerk for the campaign committee
under Secretary Walsh, who is expected
to-morrow from lowa, having resigned
the secretaryship of the State Central
Committee. Headquarters here will be at
the Sherman House.
When interviewed Senator Jones quickly
and vigorously disposed of several news
paper stories, classing them as falsehoods.
He said :
"I made the discovery that the Chicago
newspapers under favorable circumstances
can print falsehoods. They have developed
a row between Governor Altgeld and my
self which never had any foundation in
truth. The relations between the Governor
and myself have been pleasant all along.
Governor Stone wiil not run the campaign
from these headquarters. He will doubt
less be here frequently between now and
election day, as he is a member of the com
mittee, but I expect to run the campaign
here and in Washington. A branch of the
Washington literary bureau will be estab
lished here. Our ticket will be elected
a doubt. Mr. Bryan's New York
speech had a most excellent effect on the
East. It started the people thinking and
studying, and as a result we are mating
great gains in the East. It is all nonsense
to talk of the silver sentiment dying out
or being on the wane-"

EMERGES FROM
FLOES Of ICE,
Nansen's Arctic Steamer
Fram Arrives Safely
at Skjervoe.
DRIFTED IN CURRENTS.
One Theory of the Explorer Borne
Out by the Vessel's Move
ments.
PREDICTED THE COURSE TAKEN
All Those Who Started on the Perilous
Voyage Return in Good
Health.
CHRISTIANIA, Norway. Aug. 20.â Dr.
Nansen's Antic exploration steamer
Fram has arrived safely at Skjervoe, a
fishing port on the bay near the North
Cape.
Shortly after receiving news of the ar
rival of the Fram at Skjervoe, and her in
tention to sail from that place at once for
Tromsoe, Dr. Nansen started for the latter
place to meet her. Before leaving Ham
merfest Nansen wired Captain Sverdrup,
the commander of the Fram, as follows:
"A thousand welcomes to you all. Hur
rah for the Fram I"
A diÃpatch from Skjervoe to the Aften
posten says that on August 14 the Fram
called at Danes Island, where a visit was
made to M. Andree, the Swedish explorer
whose intention it is to find the north
pole by means of balloon. M. Andree has
not yet made his ascension. The Fram
sailed from Skjervoe for Tromose to-day.
All on board were well.
The Fram, with Dr. Nansen on board,
sailed from Christiania June 24, 1893. Dr.
Nansen's plan was to make for the New Si
berian Islands, and thence sail direcily
north until the Fram should be imbeded
in the ice, then drift along with it, follow
ing the west coast of any land that mignt
be met.
Nansen left the Fram in March, 1895, in
latitude 84. longitude 10 deg. 27 mm., to
explore north of the Franz Josef route,
and her arrival at Skjervoe is strictly in
accordance with his prediction that slje
would eventually arrive at Bpitzbergen or
some other point in the open sea.
Nothing bad been heard of the Fram
since Nansen left her in March, 1895.
north of the eighty-third parallel of lati
tude and in company with Lieutenant
Hansen started on a journey which lasted
fifteen months. At the time the Fram
had been imprisoned in the ice for about a
year and a half.
'I he vessel had been especially built for
the ice service. She was heavily braced
and was of such shape that when nipped
by the ice, instead of being crushed, she
rose up to the surface of the floe and es
caped without serious injury.
That the theory on which she was bnilt
was correct is proved by the fact that she
remained imprisoned in the ice for nearly
three years, drifted across a part of the
Arctic region never before traversed and
yet escaped and returned in safety.
The vessel was provisioned for rive
years, bo there was littie danger of the
crew suffering for want of food.
VOYAGE OF THE FRAM.
The Vessel Drifted in the Direction Xan-
<Â«n Jixpected.
CHRISTIANA. Norway, Aug. 20.âCap
tain Sverdrup upon arrival at Skjervoe
telegraphed to the Government that the
Fram bad arrived after a successful voy
age. The highest latitude reached was
85 degrees 57 minutes.
A dispatch from Skjervoe to the Aften
posten says that after the Fram left the
New Siberian Islands she became fast im
bedded in the ice, which drifted in the
direction Dr. Nansen expected it to do.
From July 10 the vessei worked her way
through the ice in a southerly direction,
and reached open water on August 13.
When in the highest latitude reached
some birds â guillemots and fulmers â and
narwhals were seen, but no other organic
life was visible.
The Verdensgang has a dispatch from
Skjervoe which states that the deepest
sounding taken by the Fram was 2185
fathoms (13,110) feet. The lowest tem
perature recorded during the voyage was
52 degrees below zero.
NORWEGIANS ARE JOYOUS.
Great Enthusiasm Caused by the Arrival
of the Fratn.
CHRISTIANIA, Norway, Aug. 20. -The
safe arrivtil of the Fram after her long
voyage in Arctic seas created much en
thusiasm here, and the buildings in the
city and the ships in the harbor were
decorated m honor of the occasion. Dr.
Nan?en is jubilant over the leturn ol the
vessel, and will board her as soon as she
arrives at Tromsoe from Skjervoe.
King Oscar to-day sent a telegram to
Captain Sverdrup heartily greeting him
and congratulating him upon the termina
tion of his perilous voyage.
MURDERED BY RUSTLERS
Excitement Caused by the Find
ing of the Body of Missing
Joseph Rose.
Stolen Cattle Lead to the Detection of
a Most Shocking Crime in
Nebraska.
SIDNEY, Nkbe., Aug. 20.â The people of
Eimball County are greatly excited over
the rinding of the body of Joseph Rose,
who mysteriously disappeared on July 27.
On that day Rose left home on horseback
in company with two friends in search of
some missing cattle, the fiiends being on
their way to Cheyenne. As he did not
return when expected his parents con
cluded he had gone with his friends to
Cheyenne. This theory, however, was
wrong.
The trail of the missing cattle was found
and followed and the cattle identified in
possession of D. A. Cocnran, a reputed
cattle-rustler of Kimball, near the Sioux
County line. Cochran was arrested and
taken to Greeley, Colo., and a thorough
search made for the body of Rose.
Jack Elliott, detective for the Colorado
Stock Association, lound the body care
fully buried, face downward, about two
and a half feet deep, and near by in an
other hole were found the saddle and
bridle from Rose's horse. The body was
found about forty miles from the Rose
rancn, and it is supposed that the boy was
either killed near home and his body car
ried to the place of burial or that he was
caught, tied to his horse and taken to this
place ar.d killed. Cattle rustlers are
charged with the murder, and a vieorous
effort will be made to capture them. Rose
was highly connected.
BROKE JAIL AND MET DEATH.
Ray Sewall, a Cattle Thief, Shot Down
While Trying to Run a Town
as He Pleased.
DEADWOOD, S. DXk.. Aug. 20.â Ray
Sewali was shot and killed at Sturgis this
morning by Fred Willard. Sewall was
under indictment for cattle-stealing, and
broke jail. He went to Willard's butcher
shop, picked up his gun and told Willard
at the point of tne gun to say or do noth
ing. He went from there to a livery
stable and ordered the keeper to saddle a
horse. The liveryman being unarmed,
proceeded to obey. While the horse was
being saddled Sewall went out. While
walking down the screet he mm the City
Marshal, who ordered him to surrender,
but, not being armed, was unable to take
him. Willard, who had secured another
gun, came up and told Sewall to drop his
gun. Instead, Sewall pulled it on Wil
lard, and both men tired. Sewall's bullet
passed over Willard's dead, while the
latter's struck Sewall in tne necK, sever
ing the jugular vein, and he dropped
dead. The Coroner's jury exonerated
Willard.
HIGHWAYMEN IN A BUGGY.
Women Robbed With Impunity by Three
Thieves on the Streets of
St. Louis.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Aug. 20.â Three daring
highwaymen driving about the streets in
a buggy made three successful hold-ups in
the past two days. Their plan was to
drive slowly along tlie outer streets till a
single pedestrian was encountered, when
they would jump from the buggy, rob the
victim and drive away rapidly. Miss
Frances Weston, the first victim, was
robbed of her purse, containine $9, at the
corner of Glasgow and St. Louis avenues
yesterday. An hour later Mrs. William
Hoppan was robbed while standing on the
sidewalk in front of her home at 7020
North Van Deventer avenue. To-day Mrs.
Mary Heddine was robbed by the same
party at Cardinal and Pike avenues. The
total sum of these robberies is small, but a
panic has set in and until the men are
arrested lady shoppers will travel in
platoons.

OTTAWA, Owt., Aug. 20.â The first
session of the Eighth Parliament of the
Dominion of Canada met at 3 o'clock this
afternoon. His Excellency, theJGovernor-
General, proceeded to the Senate Chamber
and taking his seat upon the throne, the
members of the House of Commons being

men of the House of Commons: The necessity
of making provision for the public service has
compelled me to summon you together at this
somewhat inconvenient season. It is impos
sible to lay before you at this session the pub
lic accounts lor the past year, or Indeed, any
of the reports usually submitted to Parliament.
Under the circumstances and in view of the
fact that you will be required to reassemble
early in the ensuing year it does not appear
expedient to invite your attention to any
measures beyond the passage of the supplies.
The operation of the tariff will be made the
subject of careful Inquiry during the recess
with a view to the preparation of such a meas
ure as may, without doing injustice to any
interest, materially lighten the burdens of the
people.
Immediate steps will be taken to enforce a
settlement of the Manitoba school question,
and 1 have every confidence that when Parlia
ment again assembles this Important contro
versy will have been adjusted satisfactorily.
When the House of Commons met, after
listening to the speech from the threne,
Sir Charles Tupper, leader of the oppo
sition, asked that the consideration of the
address from the throne be postponed
until Monday. His request was agreed to.

LORD RUSSELL'S
PLEA FOR PEACE.
Address of England's Chief
Justice Before the Bar

ON INTERNATIONAL LAW
Dilates Upon Peaceful Methods
for Settling All Disputes
Between Nations.
SOME TREATIES OF THE PAST.
Better Mcthcds for Settling Interna
tional Differences Than Cruel,
Debasing War.
SARATOGA SPRINGS, N. V., Aug.
20. â An epoch in the history of the Amer
ican Bar Association was marked this
morning by ihe fact that the annual ora
tion was delivered by Lord Russell of
Ki'lowen, Lord Chief Justice of England.
Convention Hall was crowded to the
doors long before the hour appointed for
the commencement of proceedings, and on
making his appearance the distinguished
visitor was accorded even a more hearty
reception than that which greeted him
yesterday.
He was accompanied by Sir Frank Lock
wood; James Fox, Queen's Counsel, and
Montague Crackanthorpe, Queen's Coun
sel. Chief Justice Fuller sat on the left
of the chair, and in the rear were a num
ber of the most distinguished members of
the American bar.
The Lord Chief Justice tooK as his sub*
ject, "International Law," and lor nearly
two hours dilated upon the advantages of
a peaceful method for settling disputes
i between nations, and its special relation
Ito the legal profession. While a technical
subject, many of his periods were elo
quently rounded and he was frequently
interrupted by applause.
Continuing Lord Russell said:
My first words must be in acknowledgment
of tbe honor done me, by inviting me to ad
dress you on this interesting occasion. You
are a congress of lawyers of the United States
met together to take counsel, in no narrow
spirit, on questions affecting the interests of
your profession; to consider necessary amend
ments iv the law which experience and time
develop; and to examine the current of judi
cial decision and of legislation, State and Fed
eral, and whither that current tends. I, on
; the other hand, come irom the judicial bench
| of a distant land, and yet I do not feel that I
jam a stranger amongt you, nor do you, I
think, regard me as a stranger. Though wa
lepresent political communities which differ
widely in many respects, in the structure ot
their constitutions and otherwise, yet we have
many things in common.
We speak the same language; we administer
laws based on the same judicial conceptions;
we are co-heirs in the rich traditions of polit.
ical freedom long established, and we enjoy in
common a literature the noblest and the pursst
the world has knownâ an accumulated store
of centuries to which you, oa your part, have
made generous contribution. Beyond this the
unseen "crimson tnread" of kinship, stretch*
ing from the motlier islands to your great
continent, unites us, and reminds us always
that we belong to the same, though a mixed,
racial family. Indeed the spectacle which we
to-day present is unique.
We represent the great English-speaking
communities â communities occupying a large
space of the surface of the earthâ made up of
races wherein the blood of Celt and Saxon, of
Dane and Norman, of Pict and Scott ara
mingled and fused into an aggregate power
held together by the nexus of a common,
speechâ comt.ining at once territor.al do.
minion, political influence and intellectual
force greater than history records in the ca3Â«
of any other people. This consideration la
prominent among those which suggest thÂ«
theme on which I desire to address youâ
namely, international law.
The Knglish-speaking peoples, masters not
alone of extended territory but also of a
mighty commerce, the energy and enterprise
of whose sons have made them the great
travelers and colonizers of the worldâ have
interests to safeguard in every quarter of it,
and, therefore, in an especial manner It is
important to them that the rules which,
govern the relations of states inter se should
be well understood and should rest on the
solid bases of convenience, of justice and of
reason. One otheT consideration has prompted
the selection of my subject. I knew it vu one2
which could not fail, however imperfectly
treated, to interest you. >
You regard with just pride the part which
the Judges and writers of the United States
have played in the development of interna
tional law. Story, Kent, Marshall, Whecton,
Dana, Woolsey, Hal'.eck and Wharton, amoNg
others, compare not unfavorably with the
workers of any age in this province of juris
prudence.
International law, then, is ray subject. The
necessities of my position restrict me to. at
best, a cursory cud perfunctory treatment
of it. ...
I propose briefly to consider what is Inter
national; its* nources; the standardâ the
ethical standardâ to which it ought to con
form ; the characteristics of its modern tend
encies and developments, and then to add
some. I think, needful words on the question,
lately so much discussed, of international
arbitration.
1 call the rules which civilized nations have
agreed shall bind them in their conduct
interseby the Benthamite title, "International
Laiv." . . -
Upon the subject of arbitration the Lord
Chief Justice continued:
It is obvious, therefore, that the sentiment
lor peaoe and in favor of arbitration as the
alternative for war is growing apace. How
has that sentiment told on the direct action of
nations? How far have they.shaped their pol
icy according to its methods? The answers to
these questions are also hopeful and encourag
ing. * â 
Experience has shown that over a large area
international differences may honorably,prac
tically and usefully be dealt with by peaceful
arbitrament. There have been since 1815 some
sixty instances of effective international arbi
tration. To thirty-two of these the United
States has been a party and Great Britain to
some twenty of them.
There are many instances also of the intro
duction of arbitration clauses into treaties.
Here again the United States appears in the
van. Among the first of such treatiesâ not
the very firstâ is the Guadaloupe-Hldaleo
treaty of 1848 between the United States and
Mexico. Since that date many other countries
have followed this example.
In the year 1873 Signor Manclni recom
mended that, in all treaties to which Italy was
a party, such a clause should be introduced.
Since .the treaty of Washington such clauses
have been constantly inserted in commercial, |
postal and consular conventions. They are to j
be found also in the delimitation treaties of \
Portugal with Great Britain and with the |
Congo Free State made in 1891. In 1895 the
Belgian Senate, in a single day. approved of j
four treaties with similar clauses, namely, j
treaties concluded with Denmark, Greece, !
Norway ana Sweden.
There remains to be mentioned a class of
treaties in which the principle of arbitration
has obtained a still wider acceptance. The
treaties of~IBBB between Switzerland and San
Salvador, of 1888 between Switzerland and
Ecuador, oi 1888 between Switzerland and
the French Republic and of 1894 between
Spain and Honduras, respectively contain an
agreement to refer all questions in difference,
without exception, to arbitration. Belgium
has similar treaties with Venezuela, with the
Orange Free State and with Hawaii.
These facts, dull as is the recital of them,
are full of interest and hope for the future.
But are we thence to conclude that the millen
nium of peace has arrivedâ that the dove has
returned to the ark, sure sign that the waters
of international strife have permanently sub-
Bided?
. I am not sanguine enough to lay this flatter
ing unction to my soul. Unbridled ambition â
thirst for wide dominionâ pride of power still
hold sway, although I believe with ' lessened
iorce and in some sort under the restraint of
the healthier opinion of the world.
But further, friend as I am of Peace, I would
yet affirm that there may be even greater ca
lamities than warâ the dishonor of a nation,
the triumph of an uprighteous cause, the per- |
petuation of hopeless and debasing tyranny:
War Is honorable.
In those who do their native rights maintain:
In those whose swords an iron barrier are,
Between the lawless spoiler and the weak;
But is,' in those who draw the offensive blade
For added power or gain, sordid and despicable.
In conclusion Lord Russell said:
Mr. President. I come to an end. I have but
touched the fringe of a great subject. No one
can doubt that sound and well-defined rules
of international law conduce to the progress
of civilization and help to ensure the peace of
the world.
In dealing with the subject of arbitration, I
have thought it right to sound a note of cau
tion, but it would, indeed, be a reproach to our
nineteen centuries of Christian civilization, if
there were now no better method for settling
international differences than the cruel and
debasing methods of war. May we not hope
that the people of these States and the people
of the Motherland â kindred peoples â in
this matter, set an example of lasting influ
ence to the world?
We boast of our advance and often look back
with pitying contempt on the ways and man
ners of generations gone by. Are we ourselves
without reproach? Has our civilization borne,
tbe true marks? Must it not be said, as has
been said of religion itself, that countless
crimes have been committed in its name?
Probably it was inevitable that the weaker
races should, in the ena, succumb, but have
we always treated them with consideration
and with justice? Has not civilization too
often been presented to them at the point of
the bayonet and the .Bible by the hand of the
filibuster?
And apart from the races we deem barbarous
is not the passion for dominion and wealth
and power accountable for the worst chapters
of cruelty and oppression written in the
world's history? Few peopleâ perhaps none â
are free from this reproach. What- indeed is
true civilization? By its fruits you shall know
it. It is not dominion, wealth, material lux
ury; nay, not even a great literature and edu
cation widespread â good though these things
be. Civilization is not a veneer; it must pen
etrate to the very heart and core of societies
of men.
Its true signs are thought for the poor and
suffering, chivalrous regard and respect for
woman, tbe frank recognition of human
brotherhood, irrespective of race or color or
natfpn or religion, the love of ordered freedom,
abhorrence of what is mean and cruel and
vile, ceaseless devotion to the claims of justice.
Civilization in that, its true, its highest sense,
must make for peace. We hare solid grounds
for faith in the future. Government is becom
ing more and more, but In no narrow class
sense, government of the people by the people
and for the people.
Populations are no longer moved and
maneuvred as the arbitrary will or rettiess
ambition or caprice of kings or potentates
may dictate. And although democracy is sub
ject to violent gusts of passion and prejudice,
they are gusts only. The abiding sentiment of
the masses is for peaceâ for peace to live in
dustrious lives and to be at rest with all man
kind. With the prophet of old they feel
though the feeling may find no articulate utter
ance â "how beautiful upon the mountains aro
tbe feet of him that bringetli good tidings,
thatpublisheth peace."
Mr. President, I began by speaking of the
two great divisionsâ American and Britishâ of
that English-speaking world which you and I
represent to-day, and with one more reference
to them I end.
Who can doubt the Influence they possess
for insuring the healthy progress ar,d the
peace of mankind? But if this influence Is to
be fully felt they must work together in cor
dial friendship, each people in its own sphere
of action. If they have great uower, they have
also great responsibility.
No cause they espouse can fail; no cause
they oppose can triumph. The future Is, in
large part, theirs. They have the making of
history in the times that are to come. The
greatest calamity that could befall would be
strife which should divide them.
Let us pray that this shall never be. Let us
pray that they, always self-respecting, each in
honor upholding its own flag, safeguarding Its
own heritage of right and respecting the
rights of others, each in its own way fulfilling
Us high national destiny, shall yet work in
harmony for the progress and the peace of the
world.
Lord Russell concluded his address at
12:15 o'clock. As he closed the audience
vigorously applauded, and tben, by w%y
of emphasizing its approval of Lord Rus
sell's remarks, rose to its feet and cheered
for several minutes. An informal recess
was taken, during which all who could
possibly do so crowded to the platform
and clasped the hand of Lord Russell.
When order was restored Edward J.
Phelps of Vermont moved that the thanks
of the association be presented to Lord
Russell for the eloquent address of his
lordship which they had had the pleas
ure of hearing. This was seconded by James
Carter of New YorK and carried. General
E. E. Bullard of Mew York offered the
following, which was carried unani-
I mously :
Ecsolved, Tnat the American Bar Association
concur with the principles enunciated in the
eloquent address of Lord Chief Justice RusselL
Be it further
Resolved, That i I be referred to the commit
tee on international law to recommend such
i further Cause of international arbitration.
During this time Lord Russell ana hi 3
party retired from tbe hall. The routine
business of the association was taken up.
The first of the routine business was the
report of the committee on jurisprudence
and law reform, of which Senator Gray of
Delaware is chairman. He reported prog
ress) and asked further time.
Robert D. Benedict of New York, chair
man of the committee on judicial admin
istration and remedial procedure, pre
sented a very voluminous report, which in
the main favored appeals in criminal
cases. The report was adopted.
The report on international law was
made through the chairman of the com
mittee, Everett P. Wheeler of New York
City.
It recommended that the American Bar
Association concur in the resolutions
adopted by the American conference on
international arbitration at Washington
in April which favored the immediate es
tablishment between the United States
and Great Britain of a permanent system
of arbitration and the earliest possible ex
tension of such a system to embrace all
civilized nations.
These resolutions were most ably
seconded by Hon. Henry Hitchcock of
Missouri and unanimously carried. The
fact that Montague Crackanthrope was to
read a paper on "'The Uses of Legal Testi
mony" was sufficient to bring out a large
crowd at the evening session. Mr. Crack
anthrope was accorded a generous ovation
when he was introduced by President
Moorfield Storey of Boston. At the close
of tne address the reports of the special
committees were received.
ON LEGAL PRODCAULOS.
Some Interesting Papers Read During
the Session.
SARATOGA, N. V.,"Aug. 20.â The ses
sion on legal education held at 3 o'clock
this afternoon was well attended. The
first paper was by J. Randolph Tucker of
Washington and Lee University on "Best
Training for the American Bar of the
Future."
Professor James Colby of Dartmouth
College spoke on "The Collegiate Study/of
Law."
At the conclusion of the reading of the
papers, Chairman McClain invited Mr.
Crackanthorpe of England, a member of
the English Council of Legal Education,
to say a word. Mr. Crackanthorpe spoke
briefly of the English Council of Legal
Education, which he said has done much I
toward the education of English lawyers. -j
Sir Frank Lockvrood of England re- |
sponded to calls for a few remarks in a
very happy wny. Attorney-General Har
mon, Henry Hitchcock of St. .Louis, A. G.
Fox of New York, General Warrell of
Chicago, E. H. G. Ingersoll of Tennessee,
Professor Sharp of Baltimore and others
also took part in the debate.
A resolution was adopted providing
that the secretary should recommend a
certain standard to be followed by the law
schools, and that such school as failed to
come up to the requirement so recom
mended should be discountenanced.
Tbe session, after electing Edward J.
Phelps of Vermont chairman and Pro
fessor George M. Sharp of Baltimore sec
retary for the ensuing year, adjourned un- j
til 3:30 o'clock to-morrow afternoon.
ACCIDENT IN A DRYDOCK
The Steamship Ptoejicia Al
most Capsized While Being
Repaired.
But for the Strergth of the Dock-
Gates Many Lives Would Have
Been Lost.
MEW YORK, N. V., Aug. 20.â The big
drydock at Erie Basin, with the Hamburg-
American steamship Phoenicia in it, set
tled two feet last night from causes that
have not been explained. The Phcenicia,
is a big twin-screw freighter and immi
grant carrier. She had been docked for
painting and for the readjustment of her
propeller blades.
At 8:30 o'clock fifty machinists and as
sistants were at work about the stern of
the Blsip removing one of the propellers.
Without apparent cause and without
warning the forward end of the dock gave
a lurch and settled two feet There was
danger that the dock gates might givi
way.
The accident at the Brooklyn navy- yard
was fresh in the minds of the workmen,
and they fled for their lives, clambering
helter-skelter up the step-like sides of tha
dock. Tbe gates creaked and groaned,
but held iast. Then they were opened,
and the dock was flooded. It was found
that the Phoenicia was stuck fast. AIL
efforts to float her were without success.
The dock apparently sank a little further
along toward the inner end. It will prob
ably be necessary to take out the blocks
from under the steamer.
Captain Letbauper of the Fncenicia was
seen aboard bis ship. "The accident,"
said he, "was caused either by the Keel
blocks of the dock slipping out of plr.ee or
they were not strong enough to support a
vessel of such weight as this.
"There was a great amount of excite
ment at the time the thing occurred, and
certainly we bad a narrow escape.
"If the side shores bad not held the ves
sel would eurely have capsized. Ido not
know yet whether the ship lias been in
jured or not, but I do not think she has.
She hats made no water. There was no one
hurt."
Gail Hamilton's Funeral.
HAMILTON, Mass., Aur. 20.â An en

Will Not Discuss Issues
With Any One but
McKinley.
VERY LOFTY, INDEED.
May Not Even Attempt to Reply
to the Scoring by
Ccckran.
OUTLINES FUTUEE MOVEMENTS
Upon Starting Wtstward He Will
Not Stop Until He Arrives at
Lincoln.
UPPER RED HOOK, N. V., Aug. 20.â
William Jennings Bryan threw down the
gauntlet to-day to Major McKinley. It
was a dignified challenge, for in it he re
fnsed to discuss the issues of tbe campaign
with any person except the one who stands
hla equal in office-seeking ambition.
He was asked if he intended to answer !
Mr. Cockran, and said in answer that he '
was receiving many invitations from
prominent men to debate the silver ques
tion. In order to avoid further invita
tions of this nature, he said, he would not
consider any proposition to debate any j
question with anybody during the j
campaign unless a debate should be ar- i
ranged between Mr. McKiiiley and him
self, and he added that so far as he knew
no plan for such a debate was under con
sideration by either of the National com- |
mittees. Ex-State Senator Norton Chase !
and Internal Revenue Collector Louis W. !
Pratt were here tbis afternoon to make I
arrangements lor the Albany speech of j
Tuesday night next.
Mr. Bryan p ave out another itenerary
this morning. It contained a programme
of his movements from Erie to Lincoln,
and was dictated in this way by the can
ditate:
â¢'Leave Erie for Buffalo on Thursday,
August 20, where I will speak in the even
ing; from Buffalo go to Medina, where I
will speak Friday afternoon; thence to
Niagara Falls, where I will spend the
night."
"Leave Niagara Falls on Saturday morn
in?, through Buffalo for Hornellsville,
where I will speak in the afternoon,
thence to Jamestown io the evening, t and
going to Cliautauqua for Sunday. On
Monday morning I will leave Chautauqua
for Cleveland, speaking there in tbe even
ing on Monday, the 31st.
"From there to Colnmbus, Ohio, where
I will speak on the evening of September
1. Thence to Toledo, Ohio, where I will
speak on the evemnp of the 2d, thence to
South Bend, where I will speak on the
evening of the 3d.
"The 4th will be spent, at Chicago at
Democratic National headquarters, and go
to Nebraska over the Burlington route,
arriving in Lincoln on the sth. I will not
stop at any point between Chicago and
Lincoln."
Hon. Elliott Danforth, who presided at
the Madison-square Garden meeting, came
over to Upper Red Hook last uight on his
way to Albany and had a talk with the
nominee. Mr. Bryan says the visit had
no political significance.
Thi3 morning a son of James W. Hinck
ley, chairman of the Democratic commit
mittee, who was one of the gold leaders at
Chicago, called on Mr. Bryan and ex
tended an invitation on behalf of his
father to visit Winuisooi Lodge on Sledge
Mountain in the CatskiiJs.
Winmsook Lodge is the summer home
of a number of Democratic State politi
cians, and Mr. Bryan promised to spend a
night there this week. Another invitation
came from C. L. Rickerson. He wanted
Mr. Bryan to visit Santa Cruz Lodge in
the Catskilis, but the nominee was obliged
to decline. Mr. Bryan will speak at Tivoli,
in this county, Saturday night.
TO FOUND A LIQUOR TRUST.
Wholesale Dealer* in' Whisky . Combine to
â  : \ : ' Control Prices. ;-'i .' â â '.
NEW YORK. N. V., Aug. 20.â A â  meet
ing of wholesale liquor-dealers will be held
to-day to take steps toward the formation
of a new National organization, which may
possibly in r the future .'â  exercise â  a control
ling interest in the distilled liquor trade.
A circular was : sent out in July by P. W.
Engs A Sons, in which the suggestion was
made that a convention of wholesale liquor
dealers be called, where the existing i : evils
in the trade may be discussed and remedies
uroposed. Tbe formation of a new Na
tional association of liquor-dealers was
atl vised.
The circular was sent to prominent and
representative wholesale dealers through
out the country, and a general and prompt
response was received. Some of those ad
dressed declined to enter into the scheme,
but tbe majority approved of It.
E. L. Snyder, head of the firm of P.
W. Engs <fc Sons, said yesterday that
the movement was not destined to be
hostile to the distillers, although no dis
tiller for the present will be permitted
to enter the association. Snyder said the
American liquor trade was suffering just
now from a variety of causes, chief of
which was the overproduction of whisky
by distillers. Another cause of the trouble
was the wild and irresponsible speculation
in whisky.
It is now proposed to secure the con
tinuous and permanent regulation of the
output of whisky, so that it sball con
form to the legitimate demand and wholly
do away with speculation on tbe part of
outsiders.
The name proposed for the new organi
zation is the National Wholesale Liquor
Dealers' Association. The convention
will b3 held in the Chamber of Commerce
at Cleveland, Ohio, August 31.

Shooting Stop* an Argument.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, Aug. 20.â A side
walk discussion of the free coinage of the
silver question here this evening led to
a tragedy. Joseph Rath, a retired manu
facturer, and Horace Weyman, an Eng
lishman engaged in literary pursuits, en
gaged in a very animated debate. Finally
they separated, Weyman thinking little
of it, but Rath secured a revolver, and
when Weyman came back, fired three
shots at him, one striking him in the right
arm and shattering the bone. Rath was
arrested. Weyman is a cousin of Stanley
Weyman, the novelist.
Samuel Smith for Congress.
HOLLY, Mich., Aug. 20.â The Republi

resolutions adopted indorsed the St. Louis
platform.
ANGRY SALINAS CITIZENS.
Condemn Examiner Strictures on Judge
Dorn and Treasurer Hartnell as
Scurrilous.
SALINAS, Cal., Aug. 2O.âAn editorial
in to-day's San Francisco Examiner
severely criticising Judge Dorn of this
county and referring to our County
Treasurer as an embezzler against whom
several indictments bad already been
found has been the subject of conversa
tion generally on our streets since the
Examiner reached here. Tbe article is
condemned by every one as scurrilous.
U. Hartnell, our Treasurer, has occupied
the position for oyer twelve years and there
is not a more honorable or more upright
gentleman in our county.
No suspicion of any kind has ever been
directed to him and no indictment of any
kind made against him, nor has he ever
been under Investigation. He is widely
known over the State, and deeply feels
tbe unwarranted and libelous charges
made against him by the Examiner.
Judge Dorn rendered a decision recently,
sitting as Judge of the Superior Court of
San Benito County, holding that the Grand
Jury of that county had been illegally
impaneled, but he had nothing to do
with impaneling the Grand Jury nor any
thing else in connection with it until
called there to hear a motion to quash an
indictment made by the Grand Jury ; in
fact, not a single statement of fact made
by the Examiner is true.
The decision made by Judge Dorn is
supported by a long line of authorities of
this State and other States, and the Ex
aminer's criticism of his conduct is en
tirely unwarranted.
Such attacKs as these against upright
and honest citizens and public officials are
too common, and in this particular in
stance the attack is entirely unjustifiable
and may yet cause tbe Examiner some
trouble.
MICHIGAN'S VOTE
TO BE ALL RIGHT,
General Trowbridge Brings
Good News to the
Leaders.
REPUBLICANS WILL WIN.
McKinley and Hobart Now Have
the Support of Sober
Thinkers.
IOWA ALSO IS THE COLUMN.
Ex-Lieutenant Governor Hu'l Says a
Majo:ity of Fifty Thousand May
Bj Expected.
NEW YORK, N. V., Aug. 20.â Among
the callers at Republican National head
quarters during the afternoon was General
I. S. Trowbridge of Detroit, ex-Collector of
Internal Revenue.
"The Michigan electoral vote,' : he said,
"will certainly be cast for McKinley and
Hobart. The sober second thought that
has come after studying the silver ques
tion has brought our farmers, such as
were affected by the craze, I mean, to
their senses."
Hon. John A. T. Hull, ex-Lieutenant-
Governor of lowa, now Representative
in Congress from the Dcs Moines district,
came over from Washington to confer
with the executive committee.
Mr. Hull, speaking of the outlook in
lowa, said that the campaign proper is
just ibout to open in lowa.
"RiÃht after Mr. Bryan's nomination,"
he said, "there were signs of considerable
silver sentiment, especially among the
farmers of the interior, but I am assured
that what tnere was has waned consider
ably and is daily becoming weaker.
"I shall be disappointed if we do not
have 50,000 majority over the combined
opposition and eleot the entire Congres
sional delegation of eleven members."
Colonel Charles W. Fuller of Bayonne,
N. J., who was another caller at head
quarters, said that the Republican cam
paign was being prosecuted vigorously in
his State.
LETTERS FROM LEADERS.
How Republicans Will Fulfill the Pledge
and Promote Bimetallism.
CINCINNATI, Ohio, Aug. 20.â The Cin
cinnati Post publishes to-day special let
ters from Senators Sherman, Lodge,
Thurston, General C. H. Grosvenor, Con
greesm an Bartholdt and others as tohow
the Republicans will fulfill their party
pledge to promote international bimet
allism.
Mr. Sherman writes: "I do not think
it advisable to prophesy for the future,
based upon contingencies that I don't
know will happen."
Mr. Lodge advocates a compact through
tbe regular forms of diplomatic negotia
tion.
Mr. Thurston wants a monetary confer
ence convened.
General Grosvenor proposes that the
President himself, upon the very thres
hold of his administration, should in
diplomatic but most earnest language
huggest to the great nations of the
earth the propriety of such an
adjustment of the relative values between
gold and silver money, and that Congres
should pass an act authorizing the Presi
dent to appoint a commission to draft and
submit to the great financial nations a
plan for a bimetallic agreement and call
upon those nations to respond by the ap
pointment of a like commission.
ALL CAUSED BY POLITICS.
The Law Jinn of OirkiiiHon, Thurber
and Stevenson IHasolred.
DETROIT, Micii., Aug. 20.â The law
firm of Dickinson, Thurber & Stevenson,
which is comprised of Hon. Don M. Dick
inson, Henry T. Thurber, private secretary
to President Cleveland and Elliott G.
Stevenson, late chairman of the Demo
cratic State Central Committee, has dis
solved on account of political differences,
which have arisen between Messrs. Dick
inson and Stevenson since the Chicago
convention.
In the Chicago convention Mr. Steven
son posed as the mouthpiece of Mr. Dick
inson, who represented the administra
tion. Stevenson was chairman of the
Michigan delegation and also chairman of
the State Central Committee. He declared
he would resign from the latter position,
not on account of the platform, but be
cause of tbe treatment of tbe Michigan
delegation in the convention.
Mr. Stevenson did resign, but his resig
nation was not accepted, which was con
sidered purely a personal victory rather
than one for gold or the administration.
Later Mr. Stevenson resigned again and
made way for Fred A.' Baker, a rabid
silver advocate, retaining a place in the
committee, however. Mr. Stevenson has
been taking an active part in the cam
paign in the interest of Bryan and Sewa-11.
This action on the part of Stevenson so
incensed Mr. Dickinson that the relations
between the members of tbe firm became
greatly strained.
Articles of dissolution of the firm were
signed Saturday. Mr. Thurber will re
main witu Dickinson. This law firm
probably had a larger revenue than any
other similar firm in the State. Mr. Ste
venson, besides being one of the most con
spicuous Democrats in Michigan, is con
sidered a lawyer of great ability. He came
here from Port Huron a few years ago to
become the junior partner of the firm and
immediately took high rank among De
troit lawyers.
MAJOR McKINLET'S LETTER.
It Will Be Complete Upon the Tariff and
Money Questions.
CANTON, Ohio, Aug. 20.â Major Mc-
Kinley worked on the last proofs of his
letter of acceptance most of the day. The
letter will contain several thousand words
and will be very explicit on the money
question, but the tariff will not in any
way be neglected. This evening he gave
some time to the consideration oi tbe
speech which he is to make to tbe citizens
of Ellwood and Newcastle, Pa., who are to
call upon him Saturday. A dispatch re
ceived to-night says there will be between
1500 and 1800 in the party.
Major McKinley will be kept busy with
speechmaking from this time on. Mon
day he will make two speeches. A dele
gation of farmers from Pennsylvania and
Maryland is announced for the middle of
September and an excursion equally as
large is expected from Baltimore.
Hon. R. C. Kerens of St. Louis has been
asked by a large number of railroad em
ployes in that city to arrange a trip to
Canton for their benefit, and some 500 of
them will be here next month.
Among Major McKiniey's callers this
afternoon was T. J. Morgan, who was
Commissioner of Indian Affairs under the

PALMER FOR McKINLET.
Prefer* Sound Money to Bryan and free
Silver.

M. Palmer of Illinois was asked by a cor
respondent at TaylorvilJe, 111., to-day if
be would accept tbe Presidential nomina
tion if tendered him by the National
Democratic Convention at Indianapolis.
Senator Palmer replied: "No, tir, I would
not tbink of it. It is impossible."
"What do you think the Indianapolis
convention will do, Senator?"
"It looks now as tboufch they would
meet and adopt a platform, and then ad
journ without naming a ticket."
"In that event what will the so-called
"sound money" Democrats do â vote for
McKinley or not vote at all?'
"I think most 01 them will vote for Mc-
Kinlev. I would advise all of them to
do so."
"Then you would rather have McKinley
and protection than Bryan and free
silver?" was put direct to the Senator.
"Yes," he replied. "I think protection
is absurd, but I would rather have Mc-
Kinley on that issue than risk Bryan and
free silver.

James Lee Murders His
Mistress in Cold
Blood.
RIJOICES AT THE CRIME
Mollie Allen, the Victim, Had
Left Him to Live With
a Japanese.
THE ASSASSIN AN PX-CONVICT
Shoots at His Pursuers and Attempts
to Kill the Officer Who
Captures Him.
SACRAMENTO. Cal., Aug. 20.â Mollie
Allen, a member of the half world, was
shot and instantly killed by her lover on
Fourth street, between L and M, in this
city about 5 o'clock this afternoon, and
there can be no doubt but what the mur
der was premeditated and coid-blooded, as
tbe perpetrator makes full and free ad
mission that such is the case.
The woman was a former resident of
Place rville, El Dorado County, and at one
time possessed a happy home, husband
and two little children, but domestic
troubles arose and she forsook her family
and gradually drifted to the baa. Several
months since she met James Lee, a young
man 20 years of age, who had been lately
discharged from San Quentin, where he
had served three years on a charge of
grand larceny in having robbed a man
ol a watch in San Francisco.
The couple became infatuated with each
other and agreed to join fortunes. Lee
worked as a cook in cheap restaurants and
gave his earnings to the woman. Last
night he found on his return home that
tbe woman bad deserted him and taken
up her quarters wiih a Japanese. He
traced the couple to a house in Japanese
alley, and finding the two together fired
three shots at the Jap, none of which,
however, took effect, and on the approach
of the police all the parties made their es
cape.
To-day he reloaded his revolver and sta
tioned himself near the entrance of the
alley to await the woman's return. After
several hours' vigil he saw her coming,
and, crossing the street, joined her. His
story of the subsequent happenings is as
follows:
â¢When I Â«aw her coming I went to her
and said, 'Hello, Maud,' and she said,
'You keep away from me. I don't want any
thing to do with you. You are going to be
arrested for what you did last night' 'Am
I?' says I. 'Yes, you are.' and then she
turnea to Charlie Yates, who was standing
a few feet from us, and said, 'Keep this
man away from me.' 'I don't know that
be can,' I said, and then I pulled my gun
and let her go. I missed Maud on the tirst
two shots, bat she got the third one all
ripht and it fixed her."
In answer to questions put by City At
torney Brown, Lee told of his life at San
Qnentin, where he was known as So. 15,
--5>7. He claimed to have been innocent of
the crime lor which he was convicted, and
added:
"I made up my mind when I left that
place that if ever I went to prison again
it wonld be for doing something. That's
one reason why I shot Maud when she
said 1 was to be arrested. My other rea
son was because she left me to consort
with a Jap. She deserved death and she
get it, and I ain't sorroy one bit and I am
ready to die for killing her, for that's
what it means."
Lee spoke of the murder with the utmost
callousness and indifference, and at times
broke into a smile when questions were
put to him. He ciaima to have a father in
San Francisco and two married sisters, one
of whom resides in Oakland, and a brother
who works in a tannery in San Francisco,
but refuses to tell where they reside.
The victim is a prepossessing-looking
woman apparently about 25 years of age,
and the bullet which caused her death
entered the center of the upper portion of
the body directly between the breasts.
After firing the fatal shot and satisfying
himself that he had attained his object,
the-cold-blooded murderer, pistol in hand,
calmly walked away from the quivering
James H. Lee, the ex-Convict, Who
Murdered .Mollie Allen at Sacra
mento Yesterday.
body of nis victim, eventually breaking
into a run as the gathering crowd started
in pursuit. Then began a most exciting
cbase, in which hundreds joined, all shout
ing "Stop him! Stop him !" As the lead
ing pursuers neared him Lee calmly
wheeled and fired two shots into the
crowd, without effect, and resumed his
flight. Dodging into an alley he calmly
stopped and began loading his pistol.
At this moment Policeman Talfiot drove
up in a hack, sprang out and made a da&h
at the fugitive. Luckily for the fearless
officer Lee had a cartridge jammed in the
cylinder of the pistol and was unable to
shoot. Seeing that the policeman â¢was
rapidly approaching he hurled the weappn
at Ta'ibot's head with all his strength.
T-ie officer dodged the missile and the
next minute had the irons on Lee's wrists,
loaded him into the hack and drove
rapidly away before the main portion of
the crowd arrived.
On arriving at the police station Lee
calmly told his story to the Chief of
Police, City Attorney ana others, admit
ting his guilt and seemingly showing ab
solutely indifference to his fate; in fact,
he had scarcely entered his cell before he
v.-;ie smoking a cigarette and laughing.
There is no donbt but what Lee is but
little removed above the brute lerel and j
looking upon the woman as his wife
deems bimself perfectly justified in shoot
ing her.
REDDING'S MAIL SACK FOUND.
The Stage-Driver Says Be Could Hare
Shot the Robber.
REDDING, Cal., Aug. 20.â The mail
sack, which was thrown out of the Red
ding and Bieber stage by Driver Hampton
at the request, emphasized by a loaded
and cocked shotgun, of a bold highway
man, was found near the sceue of the
hold-up and brought to town to-day. In
his eagerness to get at the contents the
robber had cut off the whole top of the
sacs, but on discovering it to be the way
pouch had not molested the mail.
In a conversation to-day Driver Hamp
ton said that the robber was so slow and
careless in making off that he (Hampton)
could have shot him easily, but in all
probability the robber appreciated the
position of the driver, with the reins in
his hands and his foot on the brake; other
wise he would have acted differently.
Sheriff T. J. Houston started out this
morning on the track of the highwayman,
but as yet nothing has been heard from
him.
ANTI- JAPANESE AGITATION.
White Laborers in British Columbia
Graving Desperate.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Aug. 20.-The
agitation against Japanese is growing in
British Columbia until it has taken prece
dence over the Chinese question. Japan
ese Consul Nosse, stationed in Vancouver,
was arranging to bring out a large num
ber of Japanese farmhands for settlement
on the Manitoba wheatlands. These Japs
live on 25 cents a day and would save 75
cents out of $1 per diem.
As trouble was feared during the pres
ent agitation the Consul was dissuaded
from importing thia form of cheap Japan
ese labor. Nosse says there are 1000 Jap
anese laborers in the province, but the
Trades Council claims there are 4000 and
Mabel Marie Filmer, Daughter of Captain Filmer, and the
"Daughter of the Regiment."
[From a j,hvtograpK by Leach of Los Gatox.]
that each has supplanted a white bread
winner and caused misery and discourage
ment.
The Japanese are more dangerous than
tbe Chinese as skilled laborers and work
so cheaply that they will eventually drive
white laborers from the province. The
form the agitation has taken is to have
the Government prohibit all those not at
taining to certain wealth and education.
THE WEAVERVILLE TRIAL.
Judge Jones Decides Against His
Brother-in-Law as an
Attorney.
Ten of the Necessary Twelve Jurors
Secured and Court Adjourns
Until Saturday.
WEAVERVILLE,CaI., Aug. 20.â At tbe
opening of court this morning for the trial
of Jo Gregory, accused of killing Jack Lit
tlefield, Judee Jones, referring to the mo
tion made by Oregon Sanders to admit J.
W. Turner as associate counsel for defense, j
said, that deemine tbe relationship that j
existed between himself and Turner to be
a relation of the third degree of affinity â
J. W. Turner and Judge Jones, though of j
no blood relation, having married two sis- j
tersâ in order not to perpetrate a fraud '
v pon the law and to avoid creating tre i
mendous expense to Trinity County, he j
would deny the motion, and he submitted
a manuscript which contained his written
opinion to the clerk for filing, from which
the following in substance was abstracted : j
Hon. Edward Sweeny, Judge of the Superior
Court of Shasta County, has informally beld
that no affinity existed and cited an authority
from the Supreme Court of Tennessee, found
in the forty-third or 'ony-fourth American Re
ports, which sustained* his position exactly,
and led me to believe that I was perhaps mis
taken. Upon visiting San Francisco last spring
I thoroughly investigated the question ana
my mind was changed by the right of author- |
uy being the other way. To grant the motion
would at once deprive me of jurisdiction and |
poss bly render nugatory all proceedings here- j
tofore had. At the time that the motion was
made six jurors had been accepted and sworn
to try the case. The progress that has been
made in the trial has been such that I do not
feel called upon to surrender the place to
which I was chosen by the people of Trinity
County to fill by any one. The motion will be
denied.
The work of impaneling jurors was re
sumed until 3 f. m., when the entire venire
of seventy-three talesmen was exhausted,
four jurors havine been added, making
the total of jurors chosen ten, the defense
having exhausted eighteen peremptory
challenges and tbe prosecution one. A
venire of twenty was called for from which
to select the remaining two, and it was
decided to take a recess to Saturday that
an officer might find time to serve the
subpenas and secure unprejudiced men,
the Judge considering one day sufficient,
remarking that around the basin in which
Weaverville lies there are plenty of men
in the woods who do not come to town
once in a coon's age.
The question arose as to whether the
Sheriff was not disqualified to act on ac
count of his pecuniary interest in the re
ward offered for the apprehension of the
murderers, in consequence of which an
other party was chosen to perform the
duty. Jim Dockery, as elisor, will have
twenty-two men at court by 10 o'clock
Saturday morning.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, ATJGTTST 21, 1896.
TRIAL, DRAMA AND
BLANK CARTRIDGES,
Interesting Events of Yes
terday in Camp City
Guard.
REALISTIC SKIRMISHING
Drill That Only Needed a Little
Acting to Have Been
Startling.
SHAM BATTLE TO BE FOUGHT:
How the Members of Company B
Enjoy Themselves During the
Evening.
Camp City Guard, Compact B, \
First Regiment Infantry, N. G. C.,V
Los Gatos, Cal., Aug. 20. j
The spectators who sat perched on the
fence watching the members of Company
B at skirmish drill this morning wit-
nessed a good imitation of a small-sized
battle, barring, of course, the fatalities.
All that was needed to have sent the on
lookers skurrying to cover was the occa
sional fail of an opponent's wounded man
and the hurrying of the hospital corps
with their inanimate buidens. As it was,
the timid members of the audience ducked
nervously whenever a volley was fired
close by, and not a few hurriedly de
camped as the line advanced in their
direction.
It was a real battle in all but the bullets.
The cartridges were all blank. Hereto
fore, in skirmish drill, t, c soldiers have
contented themselves with pulling the
triggers oi their empty rifles and listening
to the disappointing click of the descend
ing hammer. The result was in a meas
ure disappointing. To-day, however, when
every pressure of the index finger was fol
lowed by a flash, a report and the blithe
"kick" of the rebounding weapon, the sol
diers entered into the spirit of the thine.
Eyes flashed, lips were compressed, and
the 'boys in blue charged as wildly as
though the honor of the Nation depended
upon the success of their endeavors.
Many a man in that line of blue felt for
the first time the fierce light of battle
course through his veins, and was the bet
ter soldier for it. It was an excellent
drill, and probably worked more good to
the company than any other one had at
Camp City Guard.
The company was divided up into sec
tions, Captain Fiimer retaining command
of all, but leading in person the main
body of troops. Sergeant Lindquist was in
charge of a section of five men which
stood at the far end of the parade ground.
They peppered the main body from a sort
of ambush, and the main body tried to
dislodge them.
The charges down the field were made
in fine style. As one section would dis
charge t heir pieces, another section would
rush past them, kneel and fire a volley at
the enemy. This movement was repeated
till they were within about 100 feet of the
enemy, who stood in a clump of trees near
a church, which is in the parade grounds.
The enemy fired from behind this church
at times, just as many a time in real war
the house of God has been made an aid to
tbe passion of man.
Captain Filmer dashed around the field
of battle with all the bravery of a gallant
leader. A wire fence kept the guardsmen
separated or there is no telling what might
have happened. At the command, "rapid
fare," the boys drooped to their knees or
lay face downward on the ground, fixed
their bayonets and discharged their rifles
individually as rapidly as they could load
and shoot. The soldiers got excited,
though they obeyed orders promptly.
If there had been a flag in the fie.d this
morning there would have been a struggle
for it as certain as fate, and somebody
migut have got hurt. Foreseeing this
Captain Filmer ordered that no colors
should be carried. After about twenty-five
minutes of active skirmishing, from which
tne smoke arose in clouds, the troops
trailed arms and in single file marched
away to camp and breakfast. Though
breakfast has charms after hard exercise
the boys were loth to leave the field.
The sham battle will take place to-mor
row afternoon in a larger field, where there
is a hillside and more trees.
The following quotation from "Othello"
is inscribed on a large white banner in
camp: "I have done the state some serv
ice, and they know it." Company B is
tbe oldest in the National Guard of Caii
fornia. It distinguished itself in the rail
road strike two years ago, and has won
honors on other occasions. Captsiu Fil
mer is said to be the youngest captain in
the guard.
The japtain's daughter, Mabel Marie
Filmer, 3 years old, has been chosen "the
daughter of the regiment." She is a cute
and pretty child, with blonde hair an d
biue eyes. The captain has a boy about 6
months old, who has already enlisted.
Mail Sergeant L. R. Townsend is' the
postmaster of the camp. He was asked
by several comrades t: is morning why he
did not keep stamps and postal cards for
sale. He replied: "A city guardsman
never carried anything that can be
licked."
A letter has been received by Captain
Filmer from George Heizrnan of San Fran
cisco, who is a member of the company,
from which the following is an extract:
"It does a fellow good to see every morn
ing in The Call about two columns of
news from camp. It is very interesting
matter to me I assure you. I'll give a
diamond medal to the man catching the
most bars of Sergeant Townsend's kind."
Major H. B. Hosmer, who makes almost
daily trips to the camp from San Francis
co, Las offered a gold medal and a silver
medal to be contested for at target prac
tice and to be rewarded respectively to the
men making the highest and next highest
score in two days' shooting, ten shots to a
man. There has been but one day's tar
get practice, and these prizes may not be
competed for until the company returns
to the City.
The camp is entirely free from sickness.
Occasionally a few men line up before
Dr. McCulloch and the hospital tent early
in the morning and say solemnly and in
chorus :
"Doctor, do you know what s the mat
ter with me?"
The doctor usually knows. He smiles,
and they all "smile."
The committee of Los Gatos citizens
which is looking after the encampment is
composed of the following prominent
business men and members of the Board
of Trade: R. F. Robertson, W. H. Adams,
T. E. Johns, W. A. Pepper and J. D.
Bepgs. Mr. Adams is the Southern Pa
cific Railroad agent here. He is the most
active member of the committee in look
irg after the comfort and needs of the
boys in camp, and the most obliging sta
tion agent one would meet in a week's
time. Adams is a sort of Los Gatos Poo
bah. He is secretary of the Board of
Trade, president of the local Improvement
Club, secretary of the fire delegates (what
ever tnat is), a prominent Odd Fellow and
Mason, and if anybody wants to know
anything about anything everybody says:
"Go and ask Adams." They are talking
of running Adams for Mayor.
At 5 o'clock this evening a drumhead
court-martial was held near the flagstaff.
Corporal John Wilson was the alleged
culprit and prisoner. He was brought into
the awful presence of the president ot the
court-martial, W. D. O'Brien, by aspeci.il
detail of two men, who had their bayonets
fixed to their guns-
The charge against the prisoner, who
was arrested without notice, was "main
taining a pound in camp,' : which is
against the regulations, and "giving
drinks to the men between 1 and 3 o'clock
in the morning." A "pound" in the army
is a sort of a bund-pig saloon where
liquor is sold on the quiet.
Corporal Wilson occupies the tent with
Quartermaster Clifford, and the whole
court-martial was a screaming burlesque.
Nearly all the men in camp were gathered
in a semi-circle, seated on campstools.
T;:e judge-ativocate was Sergeant H. B.
Sullivan, and the prisoner was ably de
fended by W. J. Hayes, who is either a
young lawyer or ought to be. t
The prisoner appeared in a silk hat ami
and in his shirt-sleeves, whereat there was
a general scream of "Sweep," "sweep."
"chimney-? weep." The prisoner bowed
to the right and left, and then to the
president, with hat removed.
"What is your name?" roared the presi
dent.
" Wilson," responded the prisoner
meekly.
"Pudd'nhead Wilson?" inquired the
presi ent.
"I object to the slur east by the presi
dent on the intelligence of my client,"
screamed Hayes, jumping to his feet.
"Overruled," ruled the president, and
the farce went on, while the prisoner
seated himself on a drum.
"I don't know what a' pound is," said
the judge- advocate, "but it is very good.
I nave been there myself."
Serjeant Kellv was fined two drinks by
the president for refusing to swear that he
would tell lies in his testimony about the
pound.
"I object," roared the defendant's at
torney, jumping to bis feet and wildly
waving both arms. "It is preposterous,
sir. It has not been proven that there is
a round."
â¢â¢Sit down," said the president, bringing
a lath down on the table behind which he
sat.
Kelly finally testified, w'th much re
luctance, that there were some ''Jimmy
Johns" in Wilson's tent, but he said he
didn't know whether they were filled with
Congress water or "spiritual" liquor. This
was considered very damaging testimony,
ar.d Corporal Wilson, to help the thing
alone, looked as though he was about to
be hanged.
At this critical period Attorney Hayes
aruse with great solemnity and stated in
legal phraseology that he desired to call
the attention of the president to a very
weighty matter that was gnawing at the
vitals of the situation. Making a lofty
grandiloquent gesture he said:
"Supper 13 getting cold; I move we con
tinue thisâ"
Captain Filmer stepped forward and
said : "I would like to state that supper has
been postponed."
The prisoner then shed tears 30 briny
that they dried into salt drops on his
cheek?.
Dr. Sieberst appeared on the witness
stand with a big red hatchet in hand, with
which he had been assisting to fix the
stage for the evening's theatricals. The
prisoner paled perceptibly, while all the
court officials shied several feet.
The testimony of Dr. Sieberst and Ser
geant Kelly was funny. They refused to
testify to things in particular on the
ground that it would incriminate them
selves with relation to the pound.
President O'Brien found Prisoner Wil
son guilty because the charges had not
been sustained and sentenced him to set
'em up out of the "jimniy-johns."
Retreat was sounded, the cannon
roared, "Old Glory" dropped to earth for
the night and there was a helter-skelter
dash for the well-laden mess-table.
The dramatic entertainment given under
the trees to-night by the members of Com
pany B made a charming and brilliant
scene. About 2000 people were in at
tendance.
The hillside close to the dancing pavil
ion furnished seits for hundreds, from
which they looked down on the panorama.
If there was a small boy in Los Gatos
who was not perched on the limbs' of the
big trees above the audience it was because
he was crippled and couldn't get there.
Swarms of small boys were in the trees.
An impromptu stage with a red drop-cur
tain, and furnished with an upright piano
and plush chairs, made a pretty parlor
scene.
First came an overture by the City
Guard Mandolin Club, composed of Ser
geant Apthorpe, W. Parker, G. Bell and
B. Miller. Negro specialties were given
by the inimitable Sergeant W. H. Sieberst,
who was a whole show in himself.
Vocal solos by Sergeant H. B. Sullivan,
C. E. A. Creignton and E. L. Filmer were
much enjoyed. Henry Osthoff provoked
great laujshter by his cumicai German
specialties. Every number on the pro
gramme was stormify encored.
This was the cast of characters in the
one-act farce comeGy, "First Love": Hugh
Livingstone, a wealthy ironfounder, Ser
geant W. H. Bieberst; Emily, his daugh
ter. Miss Emilie Sieberst; Charles Fox,
his nephew. Sergeant A. H. Clifford;
Henry Van Zandt, his neighbor. Sergeant
H. B. Sullivan; Perkins, a groom, Ser
geant H. B. Taylor. Miss Sieberst looked
charming and all the performers ac
quitted themselves in a manner that
showed that Company B has dramatic as
well as military talent. Dancing con
cluded the entertainment of the evening.
Tomorrow morning at 11 o'clock the
sham battle will begin.
STOCKTON'S FETE
BY MOONLIGHT
Goodwater Grove Is Turned
Into a Bower of
Beauty.
VERITABLE FAIRYLAND.
Sweet-Faced Girls Flit About
Under the Illuminated Giant
Oaks.
WARBLERS ON THE BRANCHES.
Belles at Refreshment Stands Swell
the Fund for the Coming Great
Carnival.
STOCKTON, Cal., Aug. 20.â Goodwater
Grove was to-night the scene of the most
successful outdoor affair ever given in this
part of the State. Nothing could be pret
tier than the scene which met the eye as
the crowds left the electric-cars and en
tered the big gates.
At the entrance of the grove and for
some distance outside along the car line
hundreds of Japanese lanterns had been
hung, while inside there were thousands
to illuminate the scene.
From limb to limb and from tree to
tree, where the giant oaks cover the
ground, strings of lanterns had been
placed, bo that there was no end of light.
All of Stockton seemed to have turned
out to the picnic as one looked at the gath
ering. Hundreds of sweet-faced girls in
.' their light summer dresses flitted about
! under the trees while the concert was go
j ing on, in fact, every Stockton belle was
I on hand to lend beauty to the scene.
Before 9:30 there was not a seat beneath
j the trees, in the pavilion or at the club
' house that could be had for any price,
j while hundreds were standing about be
neath the oaks admiring what looked a
veritable fairyland, and still hundreds of
others- promenaded about along the paths
j and driveways, listening to the concert
j give*n by the Sixth Regiment band.
In the center of the grove and at the
! foot of a giant oak was the ice-cream
j booth, decorated with the colors of the
! Native Daughters and lestooned with
', multi-colored lanterns.
Here a committee of Native Daughters â ]
with Miss Louise Gallup, the Queen of the i
i last tloral carnival, as chairman â supplied j
: the wants of those lookinsr for tUe cooling
! dish.
The others who assisted were: Mrs.

â¢ assistants. Tliey were Misses Eiiza :
Wvts, Ida Safferhill, Marie Waul, Lsna:
i Nevin, Mrs. Lizette Ryan, M,rs. Lena j
â  Mills and Messrs. W. E. O'Connor, John |
Kerrick, W. H. Hosmer and George E.
I Catts.
Mrs. Belle Stockweil. Mr?. Mamie Dorr i
; and Mrs. Esther Nerdham looked after ;
. the rest of the refreshment tables.
During the evening a chorus of colored j
singer?, who ha 1 volunteered their ser- j
\ vices, sang a number of negro melodies so ;
| well that they were made to sing again
: and again.
The singers were "out of sight," being i
i hidden in the branches of the big oaks that
cover a portion of the upper porch of the
clubhouse.
Stockton's 400 turned oat en masse.
| Evry one here is becomine m; re and
i more enthusiastic over the coming cele
bration, and this enthusiasm was mani
tested to-night by the manner in which
i they turned out to attend the moonlitrht
i picnic. The proceeds of to-night's affair
! will go to swell the water-carnival fund.
This morning S. Bonner, vice-president
of the Veteran Firemen of San Francisco,
and George R. Pidgeon, chairman of the
committee of arrangements for the 9th of
September celebration, came to this city
| to arrange for bringing the association
here on the 9th.
They met John McCann and perfected
I the arrangements. They stated that they
I would come up 150 strong, bringing with
them a band of music and their old en
gines. They returned to San Francisco
to-night.
The engine which they will bring up is
! one that was made in 1826 for President
Van Buren. It was brought to this coast
round the Horn in 1849 and presented to
the Veteran Firemen.
Ursula Parlor of Native Daughters of
Jackson, Amador County, will have a
great time during the first week in
September, when the Native Sons of that
place will present them with a handsome
silk banner. Ursula will be hare in full
force during the coming celebration.
FIRE AT NEVADA CITY.
| Chlorination Worki at . the ' Providence
' Iteatroyed.
NEVADA CITY, Cal., Aug. 20.â At
! 3 o'clock . this morning the , chlorination
works at the Providence mine were discov
ered on fire. William Hocking, the .; fur
naceman in charge at that hour, had gone
to the changing room in the lower part of
the building only a few minutes before
and on his return ".i found the fire i blazing
fiercely. It bad \ started near the firebox
on : the side of the building next to Deer
Creek. , Hocking gave the j alarm to the
men on duty at the mill and soon two
good streams of water were playing on the
burning building I from the hose .that is
kept in readiness for use in case of fire. V ;
fl Adjoining the chlorination works was a
small room , in t which :. the : ". retorting;* was
done. This room was t not over twenty
five feet from the large forty-stamp mill
building/ being connected therewith by a
tramway. What little : wind there. was
blew away, from" the mill,' but i even with
this advantage the men had to work hard
to save the mill. The office, just above
the works, was . burned. Seveial ; tanks
containing v; gold r ; i in solution were de
stroyed and their contents "lost.; All the
chemicals, assaying f material : aud appa
ratus and other contents of the building
were destroyed. It ;is i thought that the
furnace was not badly damaged. '. . vr
- The loss will probably be from $7500 to
$10,000. There is 1 a "blanket" insurance
policy on all the company's property, an .
an adjustment will be necessary befor -
tÂ£o amojijxt of damage will tbe knowa 6
After the fire was \ over > men : were : set : . to

BIG FIRE NEAR FERNDALE.
Grizzly Bluff Creamery and Cheete Fac
tory Consumed.
â ;â  FERNDALE, Cal., Aug. 20.â Griz
zly Bluff creamery and cheese factory, the
largest and best ' equipped yin Eel ; River j
Valley, and situated about five miles from I
Ferndale, was destroyed by fire this morn- 1
ing .at i about [ 2 o'clock, together Â with all
the machinery, thirty boxes of butter and
twelve tons of cheese. The creamery had
a capacity of 2000 pounds of butter per day
and about the same for cheese. It was
built in 1890, and had become famous for
the good quality of i its cheese, which was
said to be the best in the Stale. The flames
were first' discovered by a daughter of J.
Davenport, managerof the creamery, who
resides within a short distance of the fac
tory. A small dwelling in close proximity
was 'also, burned. The exact cause is un
known, but it is supposed to have been
from the boiler-room. It was a joint stock
company, of which .! Messrs. ; Wheaton,
Breon Â«fc" Co. of San Francisco are agent?.
The total loss will amount to $20,000, with
$4000 insurance; recently taken at a low
rate for three years by the Fireman's Fund
of San Francisco. - Joe Davenport is the
heaviest loser. â 
m
Brnicia't Wool Fuller* Burned.
BENICIA, Cal., Aug. 20.â A fire that oc
curred here this morning at 2:15 might
have caused a great loss to this town by
the destruction of McKay's tannery. The
fire destroyed Brown <fe McArthur's wool
pullery, which stood about 500 feet west of
tbe tannery, and the high wind that was
blowing in that direction completely cov
ered the tannery with smQke and burning
cinders, and it was only by the greatest
exertions and the great facilities for hand
ling fires at the tanneryâ twelve streams
being used â that the tannery was saved.
The pullery was totally destroyed. The j
loss is about $100f>, with'no insurance.

Early Morning Blaze at San Jose.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Aug. 20.â Fire was dis
covered in the grocery store of James E.
Beggs, corner Seventh and San Carlos
streets, at an early hour this morning.
The fire originated in a closet in which
coal oil was stored. The stock of grocer
ies was damaged to the extent of $300,
which was fully covered by insurance.
YOLO'S TERRIFIC STORM
The Heavens Open for Fifteen i
Minutes and People Stand
Appalled.
* â  . â . .
A Man and a Male Struck by Light- j
ning and a Stubble-Field
: Burned.
WOODLAND, Cal., Aug. 20.â One of
the most terrific storms ever witnessed in
this locality swept over, the Southern por
tion of Yolo County about noon yesterday
and it is a miracle that no human lives
were lost.
The fierceness of the storm was not gen
eral. The only part of the county where j
any destruction was done was on the north
nide of Putah Creek, extending from
George Pierces place, near Davigville. to
the ranch of F.E. Russell, about four
miles east of Winters.
The - storm consisted of a heavy down
pour of rain, accompanied by blinding
flashes of lightning and heavy peals of
tuui.der. It lasted about fifteen minutes,
and half an hour ; later ' everythidg was
sunshine. The horses and cattle became j
frightened and ran around the fields in a
furious manner. .. ;
At J. E. LaÃue's place the lightning
struck a yearling mule which was running
with a band of horses, killing it instantly.
An employe working on the farm of |
George Pierce was struck by the lightning
ami is probably fatally injured.
A flash of lighting ignited a stubble-field
and before it could be extinguished a mile
of fence was destroyed.; While the storm
was in progress the residents of the vicin- t
ity were badly frightened, for it was one
of the most terrifying scenes ever wit
nessed by them, especially when at the
beginning of the storm nothing more seri
ous was . apprehended than :. a summer j
shower.

LIVES MIRACULOUSLY SAVED.
Slow Running of the Vessels Alone

SEATTLE, Wash., Aug. 20.â 1n a dense
fog off Browns Point, five miles oat from
Tacoma, the swift and handsomely ap
pointed passenger steamer Flyer, which
plies regularly between Seattle and Ta
coma, and the freight and passenger
steamship Utopia collided this morning at
9:50 o'clock. Miraculously enough, no
lives were lost, but the fact that the Uto
pia, which is a big and powerful vessel,
was running slowly at the time alone pre- ,
vented the sinking of the Flyer in this in
land sea with all on board â about fifty
people, including the crew.
The Flyer, bound from Tacoma to
Seattle, was in the act of crossing tbe bow
of the steamship, which was en route to
Tacoma, wnen the Utopia struck her with
terrific toroe on the starboard side, tearing
a great hoie amidships just above the
water line. Consternation reigned aboard
both vessels for a few moments.
Seeing that the Flyer was badly disabled
Captain O'Brien of the Utopia went to her
assistance, and in a few minutes the pas
sengers and crew were transferred to tha
Utopia and the Flyer was towed into Ta
coma. Though only five miles out It re
quired the greatest exertion to get the
crippled craft safely to port.
When Tacoma was reached it was found
that the Flyer had four or live feet of water
in her. She will probably be laid up for
two or three weeks, as in addition to tne
bole in her side her boilers and steam ap
paratus were badly injured.
The Utopia, which runs between Van
couver, Seattle and Tacoma, had her bow
more or less broken, the damage amount*
ing perhaps to $500, while the Flyer, which
is laid up at Tacoma, can hardly be re
paired sbort of $5000. The Utopia, after
making Tacoma, came back to Seattle to*
night. ____^___^_^^_
ATTEMPIND SUICIDE.
A Waterloo Farmhand Shoot Â« BUmmelf in
the Head.
STOCKTON, Cal., An?. 20.â A young
farmer named Huntemann, who resides
at Linden, has brought to thi? city the
news of an attempted suicide at Waterloo.
While he and a lady companion were
waiting at a blacksmith-shop at that
town at 8 o'clock yesterday morning for a
horse to be shod, a farmhand named
John yon Dohlen entered the place and
passed through to the rear of the building.
Shortly afterward a shot was heard from
the direction in which Yon Dohlen had
gone. Those in the shop hurried to the
*pot and found him lying apparently ip
the throes of death with a bullet hole i>Â»
his head and a revolver lying near his
outstretched arm. There had been no
one in the rear of the shop besides Yon
Dohlen and it was plain that he himself
had bred the shot. Yon Dohlen is about
40 years old. When not at work in the
harvest field he nung around saloons a
great deal and was frequently intoxicated.
This afternoon word was received from
Waterloo that Yon Dohlen was still
alive and it was thoueht the ball had not
entered the skull, but had circled around
under the scalp. He will live.

but to hare trotting, pacing and running
events each day.
The stables are rapidly filling with
racers and the track is always thronged

ot the State are present, among them be
ing James Dustin and John Phippen, who
have the Palo Alto string in charge.
This is the only place outside of the State
Fair that will be visited by this lot of
horses. Abdell, who holds thejyeariing
record of the world; Patita, I:Vo%\ Hel
ena, 2:15; and Athena, 2:17, are some of
the horses comprising the string. Car
ragher's stable of Sacramento is repre
sented by Blue Bells and Palatina, and in
charge of Driver Bennett.
Winship & Keating's string arrived to
day from Butte, Mont. They are headed
by the famous trotter Ottinger, 2:11, and
Agitato, pacer, 2:11. John Peiider's
horses, from the same place, are also quar
tered at the track. They are Roan Wilkes,
pacer, 2:12, and Challenger Chief, 2:15.
The great pacer, Colonel lien ton, 2:1414,
is also at the track in charge of G. F.
Crawforth, who formerly had charge of
the racing stable of the late Senator Fair.
t, "Curly" Shields has been stationed at
the track several days with a string of
nine runners, including Howard S. "Col
onel' J. B. Ferguson, late of the Bay Dis
trict Track, will start the runners, and W.
P. McNair will officiate as starter for the
trotting and pacing events.
G. W. Wallace will have charge of the
pool-selling, which insures a liberal pat

BCFFALO, N. V., Aug. 20.â Robert J
did the trick to-day and his rival, Frank
Agan, was second. While records were
not cracked, the track record was equaled
in the first heat. The eecond day of the
grand circuit meeting here brought out a
large attendance. The weather was cool
and pleasant and the track in excellent
condition. The feature of the day was the
free-for-all pace, in which Robert J, Frank
Agan and W W P scored for the word.
Robert J drew the pole and went the dis
tance without a skip. Agan held to his
wheel at the half, lapped him at the three
quarters and came into the stretch with a
good fighting chance, but the little geld
ing outfcoted him from the distance-pole,
and won by a eood length in 2:04, the
track record. The second heat Was a
repetition of the first, except that W W
P acted badly on the first half and failed
to save his distance. In the third Robert
J and Agan got off well together and at the
half Agan showed in front, but Robert . l
recovered the lost ground before the
stretch was reached and beat his opponent
home handily. Summaries:

2:15 pace was a surprise. In this event
Sherman Clay was the favorite, but Pearl
Onward was tne steadier after the first two
heats, winning with comparative ease.
In the 2:15 trot Fred B stepped forth and
won three straisiiit heats, although he had
not been counted as a probable winner.
In the third heat Splan sent Newcastle for
the beat, but was pocketed in ihe stretch,
on which he claimed a foul, but it was not
allowed. The feature of the 2:12 trot was
the fast time, the race being conceded to
Kentucky Union before the start. Pat L

went to E'la T, and the judges declared
all bets on the heat off. Affrite took the
next heat and the favorite, Badge, cap
tured the next two and the race. Pussefl,
Affrite's driver, was taken out of his seat
before the last heat and C. A. Thompson
substituted, but the change did not affect
the result of the race, as Affrite made a
bad break in the stretch, leaving Ella T to

ASTORIA, Ok., Aug. 20.â The regatta
was brought to a close this afternoon after
the most successful day of the season.
The weather was all that could be desired

a strong breeze from the northwest.
This satisfied the moss fastidious of the

previous days.
Hundreds of people arrived from the
different points this morning, and to-night
there are more strangers in town than
have been seen here for many years.
North Beach points contributed about 200,
Clatsop sent a large contingent, while
from up the river points the morning and
afternoon steamers unloaded several hun
dred. Among the latter were the mem

friends, members of the Exempt Fire
men's Association, TheDailes, Vancouver,
Liberty of Portland and Oregon City hose
teams and scores of settlers from places
east of Astoria from both shores of the
Columbia. Altogether the day was a
memorable one in the history of Astoria.

UNFAIR RIDING CHARGED.
Tom Cooper and Eddie Bald May Be
Suspended.
NEW YORK, N. V., Aug. 20.â A Herald
special from Philadelphia says: It leased
out here yesterday that charges of unfair
riding at the recent L. A. W. meet at Lou
isville have been made againbt Eddie Bald
of Buffalo and Tom Cooper of Detroit, and
that their indefinite suspension from the
track is not improbable. Chairman Gideon
of the L. A. W. racing board admitted that
charges had been brought against Bald
and Cooper and that tne papers were
forthcoming, but declined to discuss them.
"I will go over all the evidence pro and
con," said Mr. Gideon, "and if the proof
Is undeniable two more wheelmen will be
placed unuer the ban. Just bow long they j
will be suspended it would not be diplo- I
niatic for me to say, but both the public \
ana wheelmen will be treated with fair
ness. If the latter are guilty and their
offense was premeditated they will get full
measure."
Mr. Gideon, while in office, is determined
to exert all his efforts in purifying the
sport, and now that the L. A. W. has ab
solute jurisdiction over both the amateur
and professional riders the public can ex
pect to be protected against fixed races.

PACIFIC GROVE, Cal., Aug. 20.â
Frank Berry, a Monterey Alderman,
while driving up Carmel Hill, near that
city, yesterday, became entangled with
George A. Ferris, a bicyclist staying in
Pacific Grove. About half way up the

Berry s rig. He would have accomplished
it successfully had not the horse become
frightened and whirled directly in the

BITTER FEUDS IN
COAST POLITICS,
End of the Long Demo
cratic Deadlock at Los
Angeles.
NEITHER MAN SELECTED
Rose Withdrew on Condition
That His Adversary Would
Do Likewise.
H. W. PATTON IS NOMINATED.
Populists Combine With Adversaries
of the Silver Republicans
in Idaho.
LOB ANGELES, Cal., Aug. 20.â Patton
has been nominated, not the original
simon pure George S., but his namesake,
Major Harry W. Patton, editor of the
Weekly Capital of tnls city, one of Gov
ernor Budd's new trustees of the insane
asylum at Highlands.
This ends one of the most remarkable
political contests ever known in the State.
After a few ballots this forenoon, in
which the vote stood 36 to 36 for L. J.
Rose and George S. Patton, the former
took the floor amid breathless excitemeni
and, after explaining how he came to get
into the fight, proposed to end the tire
some struggle by withdrawing , from the
contest provided his opponent would do
so, too. On motion of Senator White of
the Patton forces a recess of twenty min
utes was taken to permit a conference.
On reassembling Candidate Patton
rose to speak. With much feeling he told
of the fight that had Deen waged againt
him by the Rose contingent and the loy
alty of his friends in standing by him
through the long, weary struggle.
He named John Muir and Lawyer Her
riugton of the Southern Pacific and ex
claimed, "Some victories are more disas
trous than defeats." He realized, be said,
that he had been defeated and hurled de
fiance at his adversaries as he went down
and withdrew.
He has good reason for antipathy toward
some of the railroad people.
Tom McCaffery; the company's chief
train-dispatcher here, manipulated the
wires which beat Mr. Patton. The oratory
in the same direction was ably contributed
by John W. Michell ana J. Marion Brooks.
After the deadlock candidates had with
drawn there was easy sailing.
H. W. Patton and C. A. Barlow were
placed the convention and the roll
call was ordered. Votes were cast for half
a dozen men. H. W. Patton having a
majority of all the votes cast was declared
the nominee. He is no relative of George
S. Patton.
HARD STRUGGLE IN IDAHO.
Populists and Democrats Combine De-
spite Bitter Opposition.
BALT LAKE, Utah, Aug. 20.â A special
to the Herald from Boise (Idaho) says:
The Democrats and Populists have
agreed to fuse and the bolting Republicans
are left out in the cold. After three days â
days filled with anxiety and characterized
by many features unpleasant to the par
ticipantsâthe two parties have agreed
upon a basis of fusion, and all that now
remains is for the Democratic Convention
to officially ratify the agreement arrived
at at 2 o'clock this afternoon.
The nominations will be distributed as
follows: To the Democrats, Presidential
electors, Supreme Court Justice, Governor,
Attorney-General, Treasurer, Mine Inspec
tor. To the Populists, the Legislature,
Senator. Congressmen, Lieutenant-Gov
ernor, Secretary of State, State Auditor,
Superintendent of Public Instruction.
The fusion idea was fought bitterly by
the middle-of-the-road men, who were
given the hearty support of Dubois and
the other Republican bolters. The seri
ous bonp of contention was the Senator
ship, and the Duboisites several times
came near disrupting all the prearranged
plans and stampeding the conference com
mittee.
The result of the prolonged conference
has been to embitter a number of thos:e
who fought fusion with such dogged de
termination. Among these is Hon. J. H.
Hawley, a candidate for Senator. When
he learned that the Democrats had agreed
to give the Populists the Senator he de
clared publicly that he would take the
stump against the entire arrangement.
The convention will meet to-morrow
and commence the work of nominating
the combination ticket. In this confer
ence the Democrats have come off vic
torious. Three of the Populists who op
pojed fusion bolted the convention.

pointing committees each convention se

lists were convened. The apportioning of
officers then began.

one Judge and two Supervisors. The
Populists took the other Judge, two As
semblymen and ttie remaining Supervisor.

offices.

MADERA MIKE AT STAKE.
A Land Office Case Involving
the Title to a Rich
Property.
Jumped, It Is Alleged, B cause the
Owners Had Not Performed
Legal Work.
STOCKTON, Cal., Autj. Â£O.â J. Walter
Smith, register of the local land office, has
now before him a case involving the title
of a rich mine in Madera County. It was
the property of the Dunphy estate and is
known a 9 the Hildreth mine. The title
of the suit is Tripp et al. against Carmen
U. Dunphy, the widow and administratrix
of the Dunphy estate. The case was
transferred to this county for hearing by
the Commissioners at the land office at
Washington. The plaintiffs applied to
the land office of Madera County, but they
were denied a hearing. They then ap
pealed to the United States Commission
er, who ordered Mr. Smith to hear the
case.
Tripp and others ciaim that the Dunphy
estate failed to make the necessary $100
development of the property each year
prior to obtaining a patent, and that by
reason of that failure they had forfeited
their title to the mine. They have taken
possession, and the object of the present
inquiry is to determine whether the facts
warrant their holdine possession. It is
claimed that the mine had not been
worked for the last few years and the
jumpers took quiet possession of the prop
erty, there being no one at the mine rep
resenting the estate which claimed it.
Now that there is a boom in mining the
property is looked upon as. being more
valuable, and hence the squabble to get
possession of it. W. P. Thompson, the
attorney for Tripp et al., stated to-day
that if tliere had not been a boom in min
me he believed the estate would not con
test the jumpers' claim to tne property.
j The mine is said to be a rich one, and il'is
asserted that over $500,000 was tafcen out
of it while it was in operation.
Yesterday the plaintiff s, or the con
testants, as they style themselves, put in
their side of the case. They claim that
the estate had not spent $100 on the mine
for the past three or four years, but they
specifically allege that it had not during
the year 1895. It waÂ« on the Ist of Janu
ary that they jumped the claim. The most
important evidence that they adduced was
that furnished by O. H. Cole, Justice of
the Peace of Madera County, who testified
that it was sworn to D3fore him in a crim
inal suit that grew out of the mine trouble
that $100 had not been expended on the
property in several years.
O. P. H. Evans, who represents the es
tate, asked for more time to put in his side
of the case and the matter was continued
until the 10th prox.

PYTHIANS REIGN
AT SANTA MONICA,
The Mayor Surrenders His
Keys to the Uniform
Rank.
TENTS FILL THE PARK,
While Melody From Numerous
Bands Floats Through
the Air.
DRILLS AND DRESS PARADES.
Open-Air Concerts, Dancing and Lit
erary Exercises in the
Evenings.
SANTA MONICA, Cal., Aug. 20.â The
Seventh-street park has been transformed
into a tented city with music galore, the
uniformed rank of the Knights of Pythias
being the cause, and ail day long the in
habitants of that part of town besides the
1200 in camp have enjoyed the melody of
the masters to their hearts' content.
The knights have absolute possession
of the city since Mayor Jones presented
them with the keys last night, and during
the hours of the day when there is any
thing going on at the camp it is the Mecca
for all, including townspeople and vis
itors, many of whom came down for the
day on the various lines to spend it with
their iriends in camp. All the various
regulations of camp life are observed, in
cluding the military one of the United
States army, guard mount, company and
other kinds of drills and dress parade.
The evenings are passed in dancing by the
young and gay on the platform erected for
that purpose, and by those not that way
inclined by listening to a musical and lit
erary entertainment.
This morning there were guard mount
and company drills, when the knights
made a far more creditable display of
military knowledge and tactics than was
expected. At 4 o'clock the Pasadena
band gave a moat enjoyable concert,
which was heartily appreciated by a large
audience, and at 5:30 a dress parade of
superior excellence was witnessed by a
large concourse. The Hanford division
arrived during the afternoon and aug
mented the members already present
considerably.
Coionel H. R. Arndt's staff is composed

for eight years and was supreme prelate
for four years.
To-morrow mornine there will be com

Aldricb, an 18-year-old boy, was arraigned
before Justice Dwyer this morning on a
charge of grand larceny. Last Friday

trying to sell the rig at the Nevada stables
at 1350 Market street. He was returned to
this city last night.
Aldrich, who has been living with an
aunt on the alameda, says that while on
his way uptown Friday evening a strong
desire to take a buggy ride came over him,
and he was unable to resist the tempta
tion of stealing the rig and enjoying a
ride. The boy has always borne a good
reputation heretofore and attended school
regularly. His mother and father sep
arated a few years ago, and the former
now resides in Santa Cruz.

night some miscreant damaged six large
plate-glass windows in O. A. Hale's new

and tour on the side of the entrance were
not touched. About $1000 worth of glass
was damaged. A reward of $100 for the
arrest and convictiou of the culprit has

by Judge Gray.

noon Henry and Theodore Beaver pleaded
guilty to a charge of grand larceny, in
stealing fifty-one sacks of wheat near
Tulare on August 3. With tears stream

him to it. He did not ask mercy for him
self, but for his wife and "baby, as
they would have to be the real sufferers.
Judge Gray, in passing sentence, said,
"I am not in the habit of giving light sen
tences," and sentenced the prisoner to
State prison for four years. Theodore has
only just passed his seventeenth birthday,

The McKinley Veterans' League of the
Filth CoiiL'ressional District held another
enthusiastic meeting last evening in Swiss
Hall, c: â¢ ,er of Mission and Fourteenth

In open meeting the chairman, Colonel
E. McCormick, stated that he had called
the league together to instruct the mem
bers to participate in tlie formation of Re
publican clubs In the various districts in
this City under the auspices of the county
committee.
He urged all veterans to sign the club

organisation of tbe grand army to give
battle to the common enemy of the coun
try in November next and gain a glorious
victory for good government in municipal

secure recruits for tne patriotic legions
which, under the leadership of the Hon.
John D. Spreckels, will confront the so
called Democratic party in this State and
rout this enemy of the people and elect
our comrades McKinley President and
Loud Congressman, that the idle Ameri

to form branches in those places, which
communications were referred to a com
mittee consisting of Chairman L. B.
Marks, Captain Barrett, John Fairchild,
J. Kelley, Frank Duffy, Frank Smith ana.
Alex Baldwin.
The following resolutions were offered
ana unanimously adopted:
â \Vheeeas, Every political party must have
an organization,* and all organizations must
have a head to guide them through the intrica
cies of an election, like an army which cannot
go into battle and be victorious without a gen
eral; and,
Whereas, Heretofore irresponsible men, who
had no interest at stake and who were only in
politics for their pecuniary benefit, became
leaders of the Republicans; and,
Whereas, Through this rule of practical pol
iticians the Republican voters often became
dissatisfied and cut loose from the Republican
party in local affairs and voted for indepen
dent nominees; therefore be it
Resolved, That we congratulate the Republi
cans on the selection as their leader of John D.
Spreckels, a rich business man of proved in
tegrity and ability, in which all classes, rich
and poor alike, have the utmost confidence
and assurance that he is in politics only for
the welfare of this City and State and its peo
ple generally without any sordid motives.
Whereas. The Fifth Congressional District
Convention which nominated Eugene F.
Loud, our experienced, energetic and faithful
servant in Congress, lias also nominated for
Presidential elector that stanch friend of the
farmers, the working classes and the people
generally, the Hon. Clans Spreckels, one of
our most respected citizens in this State, and
one of the few rich men who invent their
wealth and show their confidence in our City,
and use their money for the development of
the resources and the employment of Ameri
can labor in California; therefore be it
Resolved, That we hereby urge every veteran
and every workingman and every voter who
has the welfare of this City and State at heart
to cast his ballot and use ail honorable means
to aid in the election of Hon. Claus Spreckels
for Presidential elector, that by his vote in the
Electoral College for McKiuley and Hobart we
may have protection for American labor and
prosperity for the people of these United
States.
Whereas. The Republican County Commit
tee of San Francisco has ordered the formation
of district clubs and the enrollment of the Ke
puolicau voterb of the various assembly dis
tricts up to Saturday evening next for united
action infighting the common enemy of the
country, and the working classes especially,
to- wit: the Altgeld Democracy; and,
Whereas It is the duty of every veteran of
the late war to come to the front and enroll his
name as a member of trie official Republican
club in his district, that we may miiKe an or
ganized battle for the working and industrial
classes; therefore be it
Resolved, That we, the McKinley Veterans'
League of the Fifth Congressional District,
will individually and collectively Urge every
veteran in San Francisco to enroll in the Dis
trict Club before Saturday next that we may
be able to do our share toward making good
nominations and going with good men as
candidates for the various offices on the Re
publican ticket into the battle in November
next aud gain a glorious victory for the Re
publican party.
After arranging for a big mass-meeting
the league adjourned with cheers for Mc-
Kinley, llobart and Loud, Claus Spreck
els. John D. Spreckels and the Republican
party. _
THE PHOENIX CLUB.
Enthusiastic Meeting In Scottish
Hall With New Cam
paign Sonus.
The Phoenix Club ably sustained its rep
utation as a successful entertainer by the
large crowd which it drew to Scottish Hall
last evening and by the enjoyable pro
gramme of music and speaking which it
presented.
The meeting was called to order by
Chairman Powers, with Andy Branch, he
of the big legislative voice, in the secre
tary's chair. Under the head of good of
the order, Daniel Irwin sang two cam
paign songs, written by Charles Orr of
Santa Rosa. Mr. Irwin was accompanied
by his daughter, Alice, on the piano. Tne
audience joined in the choruses.
Miss Ella Ellis, a young woman with a
fine voice, sang two comic songs, in one of
which she brought down the house by a
clever allusion to the success of William
McKinley.
William H. Schooler was the speaker of
the evening. His subject was tue free
coinage of silver, and his talk was most
interesting. He began by saying that
four years ago laboring men receivtd good
wages and steady employment. He con
trasted that period with the present and
with the widespread distress which now
prevails, and added that they could look
to the only party that can help them by
protecting American industries and caus
lue the factory wheels to revolve once
more.
The speaker likened the silver-mine
owner to a roan who would take his wheat,
worth $l 15 per sack, to the United
States Mint and ask to have the stamp of
the Government placed upon it, ceriilying
that its value was $2. He himself, if he
owned grain and thought he cou.d succeed
in increasing its value in that way, would
vote for the free coinage of wheat. This
apt illustration caused a roar of laughter.
Mr. Schooler followed this telling hit with
the argument that tne difference between
the present value of 66 cents per ounce
and the 16 to 1 value of silvt r, or $1 29 per
ounce, would have to be paid by the tax
payers of the country for the enrichment
of the silxer mine-owners, because no man
made laws could ieverse the natural law
of supply and demand.
The present ratio of silver to gold was
31.56 ounces of silver to 1 ounce of gold.
It was proposed to change this natural
ratio to 16 ounces of silver to be equal to 1
ounce of gold, and the difference oetween
the natural aud the fictitious values was
to be paid by every man engaged in every

business except that of silver mining, in
order that the ratio might be kept up.

ARE OUT BUYING WOOL,
Rich French Dealers Here on
Their Way to Aus
tralia.
A fred Duboc on the Effct of Free
Silver-Will Go to Bnllicn
Value.
Alfred Duboc, an extensive wool im
porter of Reims, is at the Palace, accom
panied by several other .French wool
buyers, who have spent some time in this
country and are now en route to Aus
tralia. In the latter country they hope to
buy a great deal of wool.
"I have long been engaged in the wool
business," said Mr. Duboc, "but hitherto
I have not attempted to handle much
from America. My associates, however,
have bought a great deal ,at different
times in this country.
"The wool grown in Australia is of a
kind much in demand in France. We
have handled larpe quantities from that
country and expect to handle an unusu
ally large amount from there this year.
Our trip is directly for the purchase of
wool.
"I note you are in the throes of a great
political campaign here, and that free sil
ver is involved as a question of the cam
paign. lam unable to see how free silver
will help the United States, for, if we have
been educated rightly the silver dollar
freely coined can only have its bull. on
value. As for the gold it will flee away.
"On the other side of the Atlantic we
are all pretty well agreed that a gold
standard is the thing. One reason, I sup
pose, is because our money is mostly jrold
and because we can buy more with it than
with any other money."
Mr. Duboc and his friends sailed on the
Monowai last night. They intend to re
main there several months and will prob
ably return home via the Suez canal.
A NDREE MAY HAVE STARTED.
The Favorable Wind He Waited For Una
Come.
BERLIN, Germany, Aug. 19. â The
correspondent of' tne Lokal Anzeiger, who
has returned to Hammerfest from Spits
bergen, telegraphs that he met Sir William
Martin Conway of the Conway expedition,
wbo. said he, on August 10, had seen
M. Andree, the Swedish explorer, who set
out to attempt to discover the" North Pole
by means of a balloon. Andree thought it
was then too late to start on his balloon
voyage, ana he would probably return
home and go back in April to Spitzbergen,
at which place the balloon voyage was to
begin.
Sir William Conway added that there
was a strong south wind blowing tbe day
after he saw M. Andree, and, as that was

EXHIBIT OF THE

Something Novel at the
State Bureau of
Mining.
FROM OUR GOLD BELT.

It is inevitable that such a discus
sion concerning the precious metals as
recently has been and still is in prog
ress should attract great attention to
gold mining in California. One ar
gument urged by one party is that
gold is so scarce that it can be co rnered.
Indeed, Mr. Bryan, the Democratic-Popu
list candidate for the Presidency, asserted
in his Madison Garden speech in New
York that the gold product of the world
could be represented by a 22-foot cube,
while the silver product would make only
a 66-foot cube. The official returns of the
State Bureau of Mining show that during
the year 1895 the Stat â¢ of California pro
duced in gold $15,334,317 19 as returned to
United States Mint, and the silver product
of California in the same year as returned
according to the same authority amounted
to only $599,789 70. These figures show
conclusively the preponderance of the
gold interest in this State, and also indi
cate the important part that this State is
now playing on the stage of international
finance.
The cube of gold introduced by Mr.
Bryan in his speech has also large inter
est here, for in 1885 California sent to the
exposition at St. Louis a cube of over four
teen feet, representing the California pro
duction of pold up to that time.
All parties being agreed upon the in
trinsic value of gold, or, rather, that it
nas large intrinsic value, the gold produc
tion of this State becomes continually a
more engrossing subject of concern. Sil
ver, since the slump in value of that
metal, has cut a comparatively small
figure in California production. The
Inyo County production and the San Ber
nardino mines have a history which is too
generally known among mining men and
financiers to make repetition necessary
here for common information. "Where
can we successfully mine for gold?" is a
daily question at the State Bureau of
Mining. In response to this inquiry H.
8. Durdon, the curator of the museum at
tached to the bureau, has prepared an il
lustrative object-lesson, which is compre
hensive, striking and novel.
A large amount of the gold mined in
California has been taken from the mines
along what is known as the "mother
lode" in Mariposa, Tuolurane, Calaveras,
: Arnador and El Dorado counties. Some
years ago Harold W. Fairbanks spent five
months studying up the story of the
geology of the "mother lode," of which
three months were passed in the field and
two months were devoted to the making
of maps showing the course of the
"mother lode," the location of mining
claims and tne preparation of the speci
mens which were picked up along the loae,
and also within a belt five miles wide, ex
tending on either side of the lode. The
geological specimens in the ore-bearing
lode and in the country immediately con
tiguous were carefully designated and
numbered by Mr. Fairbanks, the numbers
corresponding to numbers placed on the
geological map, which was made a part of
the exhibit.
No scheme of greater accuracy or more
definiteness could seemingly have been
devised to indicate tbe characteristic rock
of the lode and in the country adjoining
within the counties named. The lode in
El Dorado County was traced through to
the Middle Fork of the American River,
but the inclosing rocks were only partially
located. Consequently the position of the
lode in only five counties was completely
presented. It occurred to Mr. Durden
that the geological specimens collected by
Mr. Fairbanks should be exhibited.
A glass case has just been filled with the
specimens and the geological map and the
arrangement is such that inquirers can
see in a study of a few hours more than
they could learn in months of weary pros
pecting so far as an exhaustive examina
tion of the rock formations of the coun
try all along the lode is concerned.
The specimens are arranged in order
from Mariposa County onward, while di
rectly above hangs the map showing the
lode in each ot the counties enumerated,
and on the map are the numbers corre
sponding to the numbers of the speci
mens. Miners study these specimens and
maps for knowledge of these counties. Of
course, they are applicable to only those
localities, but they are of value in that
connection.
Mr. Fairbanks had in view in making
his reconnaissance to give a thorough
knowledge of the occurrence of the ores
and to scientifically explain what he de
scribed as "one of the most remarkable
metalliferous deposits in the world." The
descriptions are to be found in the report
of 1890. The specimens which were act
ually taken from the lode and its vicinity
are on exhibition.
These give an approximate idea of the
physical characteristics of the vein. The
â¢'mother lode," according to Mr. Fair
banks' description, and this description
will be read with interest everywhere,
"may be denned as a series of gold-bearing
veins of definite characteristics and often
of great magnitude; forming a nearly
continuous line over 100 miles long. They
usually occur in a belt of black slate, with
either slate, diorite, diabase, serpentine
or occasionally granite as wall rock.
They are generally distinguished by a
peculiar green vein-matter, known as
mariposite, and by the more or less rib
bon-like character of the quartz. As far
as can be learned the term "mother lode"
was first applied to the veins washed at
Nashville, twelve miles soutli of Piacer
ville. El Dorado County, in the latter part
of 1850 or earlier part of 1851.
The extent of the mother lode has been
discussed and different conclusions have
been readied. There are geologists who
believe that it extends all the way to
Alaska. The region traversed by the
mother lode is characterized by vertical or
steeply inclined rocks, which are either
aruptive dikes or sedimentary strata.
Each of the four formations, granite,
slate, serpentine and diabase, is char
acterized by a different surface. The
granite, according to Mr. Fairbanks, is
best illustrated by that body of massive
rock at the southern termination of the
lode and is characterized by a rolling sur
lace and by a light but fertile soil. The
serpentine, unless lying in a valley where
it receives the wash from other rocks, is
uniformly distinguished by an almost
barren surface with scarcely any soil, no
grass and only a few stunted trees. Its
rapidity of erosion is between that of the
crystalline and the slaty rocks.

THE SINGLE-TAX IDEA,
A Letter From George W. Loehr
Explaining the
System.
Believes It Would, if Put in Opera
tion, Be of Incalculable Benefit
to Taxpayers.
The following letter has been received
from G. W. Loehr regarding trie single
tax:
To the Editor Daily Morning Callâ Sir: The
impartial position taken by The Call in fully
and truthfully publishing all articles pertain
ing to the public welfare prompts me in ad
dressing you this letter, hoping it may be the
means of establishing in the minds of the
public the benefits resulting from the system
of which it speaks.
As a rule man seldom rises above his envi
ronments. The evolution of humanity to a
higher civilization has been a struggle be
tween ignorance and superstition on one side,
and a few. who have with the aid of reason
and the courage of their convictions risen
above tr.eir surroundings ana stood forth as
everlasting heroes in the turmoil of progress.
Those who have had the courage to do this
have been termed "crunks," and the works
they have written ;ound but few readers. The
world was not yet ready for the reforms which
they advocated; it needed a practical illus
tration of the evils that would result trom a
continuation of our landed system before the
world was ready to see and then adopt the
measures advocated. The immense strain
between capital und labor must of necessity
find its only relief in the measures herein ad
vocated.
Now that the true political science known
as the "single tax" (which, by the way, is
a misnomer, the system being really no tax
at all) is making such rapid strides, and must
without a doubt take its place among the re
form measures in coming elections, a few
words on what it is and what it is expected to
do will not be amiss at the present moment.
A large number of reform measures are
being advocated in regard to taxation, nearly
all having a tendency to the same end, name
ly: taxation ot land values only for all com
munity purposes.
To the ordinary thinker it must stand to
reason that the more a thing be taxed the
more tendency there is to discourage it. The
natural tendency of everything, animal and
vegetable, is to grow in perfect Ireedom. This
is a divine law of the Creator and an un
answerable argument. By putting an iron
band around a young tree you retard its
growth. It is a well-known fact that the Chi
nese women retard the development of their
feet by compression. Even the human mind,
that grand faculty that distinguishes us from
the animal and makes the nearest approach to
our Maker, develops in a ratio to the amount
of education it receives. Therefore it follows
that in freedom, and in freedom only, can any
thing develop and attain its highest perfec
tion. The prosperity of any people is meas
ured by.tneir intelligence and their means and
facilities of production. Therefore, to tax or
fine that which tend* to prosperity is to dis
courage production, and to discourage produc
tion is to lower wages and to increase the price
of commodities and the necessaries of life.
This is the policy the world has been follow
ing since time immemorial, and the only rea
son to-day that political economy is being
given the attention that it is is because we
have gone to the end of our rope, and if we
don't retrace our steps, we will hang ourselves.
We stand on the brink of our civilized world;
the next step westward takes us to the pagan
world that we ran away from thousands of
years aeo. Surely no one can be so foolish as to
think that this world could not support a
larger population than it at present has.
The cry of overproduction is sometimes
raised, and yet we see hundreds, aye, thou
sands, of people whose hunger and wants are
not appeased. There must be some incon
sistency here. Surely there can be no over
production when people have not enough food
to eat and enough clothes to wear. I should
rather call it underconsumption.
We have now come to that point In onr in
vestigation where we must seek the reason
why, in a country of such large area, with a
nominal population, and ground able to produce
nearly everything the world desires, men are
to-day seeking for something to do in order to
earn their daily bread, and not finding it; and
when they do, receiving such wages as will
hardly support themselves, to say nothing of
their wives and families.
A great fault of the hnman family to-day,
when starting out on reform measures, is to
battle with effects and neglect the primary
causes of the evil. What man, be he the most
uneducated tiller of the soil, would start out
to eradicate weeds by cutting them off at the
surface of the ground, would he not dig down
and remove the roots; and yet all the great
reform parties, temperance people and labor
organizations, are all fighting effects, all
claiming to be right, while the "ignis fatuus"
is luring them on to their own destruction.
What; then is the primary cause of the evil
that is to-day filling jails and our insane asy
lums, making prostitutes of women and plac
ing a premium upon drunkenness and suicide,
while the products of industry are taxed to
their utmost to keep up this damnable retro
grade movement of our civilization? Are
these the results of man's development in
freedom, or are they the results of present con
ditions over which he has, or thinks he has,
no control? Cannot this entire brood of evils
be laid at the door of poverty aud want, the
result of bad laws? Anything, therefore, that
will better man's condition will certainly
lessen crime. Such a state of affairs is what
the single tax will bring about. It has already
been shown that taxing a thing has a ten
dency to discourage it, hence we are going to
stop taxing industry and production, because
these are the mainstays of existence, and to
discourage them is to say that we have no
right to that which nature decreed should be
ours, but our entire revenue, for all commu
nity purposes, we propose to take from land
values created by reason of the presence of the
community.
This will be a direct tax on land values as a
location. The reason we claim this to be no
tax is that the sum required by the com
munity must be equal to tne value which they
Sivo to land by reason of their presence and
industry. By thus letting the land values
furnish the entire revenue as before shown,
we naturally tend to discourage land specula
tion, which has been the curse of mankind in
all ages, the worst of all gambles. It will also
have the effect of throwing thousands of acres
of good land at present held out of use for
speculative purposes on the market at the
annual rental value, according to its location,
for when by taxation you destroy speculative
value in land no one will hold land except for
its best use, in doing which he must employ
labor and use material, both of which will
assist in solving the labor probii-M.
Regarding the wages of labor I would say
this, that the natural tendency of man is to
work for himself in preference to working for
some one else. With the land open to produc
tion, and every man able and willing to apply
his laborto natural opportunities, labor would,
Â»b a consequence, become scarce. Capital, ua
able to corner land, would be compelled to
employ lubor in the production of those things
which supply man's wants, at once becoming a
benefit to humanity instead of a curse, and
labor being scarce on account of natural oppor
tunities being open to all. labor would at once
fix the price of watres, instead of capital, hs
under present conditions. Here then you have
the solution of ihu laoor question by the true
and only science of political economy.
These are only the superficial benefits to be
derived by this system of taxation; the mind
grows dizzy trying to estimate the benefits
this change would make in our own social and
economic condition. "Paradise regained"
would but feebly express it.
Then in perfect freedom can man develop,
physically and mentally, those now dormant
faculties which his Creator intended should
make him the lord ot creation.
The tendency under such conditions must be
to a nobler and better manhood,
In conclusion let it be said that America sets
the pace in this noble movement for the eman
cipation of her fellow-man, as sne has in civil
ization. The American people cannot aff >rd
to slumber on the eve of their prosperityâ such
prosperity as the world has never seen.
The European powers would be compelled
to adopt our policy for their own protection,
as the influx into this country of capital under
such conditions would leave them penniless.
Hero, then, we have the means to an end.
The desires of humanity gratified.
The right to life, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness accomplished.
A 'heaven on earth, peace and goodwill to
men.
The earth the inheritance of all mankind.
The divine law of the Creator fulfilled.
Yours very truly, , Geo. Wm. Loehr.
X RAYS TEST DIAMONDS,
Roentgen's Discovery Used to
Expose Faulty Setting of
Bones.
Many Applications of Radiography
Explained by Professor Van
der Naillen.
The discovery, tne history and the prac
tical uses of the X ray formed the sub
ject of an interesting popular lecture de
livered in Golden Gate Hall Wednesday by
Professor A. Van der Naillen of this City,
who recently returned from Paris with
apparatus and fine radiograph plates il
lustrative of the most recent accomplish
ments with the Roentgen ray.
By the aid of the stereopticon enlarged
pictures of radiographs were thrown upon
a big screen. There was a wild duck that
had been shot near Paris. Merely the out
line of the skeleton showed, but ah about
were little binck dots where the shot was
imbedded in the flesh or lodged near the
bones. Another radiograph showed a
compound fracture in the bones of a man's
leg. That man had paid to have the bones
properly set, and after the job was done ne
walked like a horse with the stringhait.
He went to Paris, had a radiograph taken
of the bones, and then started for home
confident of winning a suit against the
doctor simply by ttie evidence of the un
skillful work shown by the radiograph.
There was a very rich lady of Paris who
suspected that her jeweler bad "changed
the stones" in her priceless diamond neck
lace. She mentioned her fears to a phy
sician who bad an X ray apparatus. He
took a radiograph of the necklace and de
veloped the plate while she waited. Pure
carbon, pure hydrogen, pure oxygen and
pure nitrogen are generally transparent
to the Roentgen ray. Only the settings of
the necklace showed in the radiograph, for
wherever there was a diamond the pure
carbon offered no obstruction to the rays
and only white srjots resulted. But three
of the large pendants near the front of the
.elaborate and many gemmed necklace
came out a? dark spots. The owner of tne
necklace brushed away a tear and prepared
to go on the warpath.
There was another case of a man who
had been shot in the foot. He paid his
money to a surgeon and had the shot
picked out, but his foot grew worse. He
had a radiograph made and it showed that
the sturgeon had taken out all the shot ex
cept about twenty more deeply imbedded
than the others.
Several kinds of glass tubes may be used
in the production of the Roentgen ray.
The common pear-shaped tube has a small
platinum plate inside the small end, with
its surface facing the big end. An electric
wire is sealed into the small end of the
tube, near the platinum plate, which is the
negative pole, cat ti ode, or source of the
cathode rays. The aurode or positive
pole, is at the side of tne tube, another
wire being sealed in mi that point.
The interior is a partial vacuum. Dur
ing the passage of an electric current rays
pass from the cathode on through the big
end of the tube and out into the air. They
are the X or Roentgen rays, but the
cathode rays are not Roentgen rays. The
constant attack nf these straight rays upon
the same spot at the big end of the pear
shaped tube in lime destroys the glass. A
professor of a Mississippi Valley college,
with whom the lecturer was returning to
America, exhibited with pride the fine
pear-shaped tubes he had purchased in
Europe for his laboratory. Every one of
them proved to be badly damaged at the
big end from use.
A little cigarette-shaped tube, named
after its maker the Collardeau tube, is
very successful in the production of sharp
images of small size, but it cannot be used
for large objects. Tbe Newton London
tube is tbe one now in most general use in
the hospitals and scientific institutions of
Paris.
The center of the human eye is not
transparent to the rays and that is why
t.jey probably cannot he seen. All other
parts of the body except the bones are
transparent; but the bones composed as
they are of various metallic salts offer an
obstacle to the X rays.
The lecture was illustrated throughout
by electric discharges through tubes, by
pictures and by a fluoroscope in opera
tion, the spectators seeing plainly the
greenish cathode rays through many
thicknesses of boards interposed between
the tube and the darkened room.
ARCHITECT POLK
MAY GO TO JAIL
Justice Groezinger Orders
Him to Produce His
Books.
ORDER OF EXAMINATION
Willis Threatened With Con
tempt of Court Pro
ceedings.
CARES NOTHING FOR THE LAW.
Admits Twenty Judgments Against
Him and Owns no Property
of Any Kind.
Architect Willis Polk spent an exceed
ingly unpleasant half hour before Justice
of the Peace Groezinger yesterday after
noon and incidentally excited the ire of
the judicial light to the extent of a threat
of a citation for contempt unless the or
ders of the court be complied with.
The member of the four hundred was
up on an order of examination procured
by Collector J. J. Raver, who holds a bill
of $50 atainst the architect for board and
lodging at the Hotel del Monte, contracted
during the period when society was so
journing at the hostelry. Willis failed to
liquidate, and numerous demands for his
board bill were unanswered. Then the
managers decided on drastic measures,
and put the matter in the hands of Raver
for collection. More demands failed to
bring coin of the realm, and the order of
examination followed.
"What personal property have you?"
asked Attorney George Perry, who repre
sented the plaintiff.
"None," answered Polk.
'Have you any real estate?" asked the
attorney.
"None," was the answer.
"Have you any solvent credits?" was
asked.
"None," was the answer.
"Well, what have you?" was the next
query.
"Nothing but the clothes on my bacs,"
said the architect.
"But how about the firm of Folk & Polk,
of which you are a member?" queried
Perry.
"Don't own a cent's worth," said Polk.
"Our last job was paid in advance and the
money was spent long ago."
By this time the youthful looking Mr.
Polk was palpably impatient and, when
the question was asked whether any judg
ments were outstanding against him,
blurted out:
"Yes, twenty or thirty of them, but
they don't bother me a little bit. My
business is designing buildings, not pay
ing attention to lawyers."
The attorney for Raver tried to find out
whether the books of Polk & Polk would
show any solvent credits that could be
used to pay the bill of the Del Monte, but
Polk answered that he had not kept books
lor eight months, in fact, since his father
had gone to Pasadena sick, and that he
did not know anything about the state of
his business.
"We would like to have the books in
court, your Honor," said the attorney.
"I don't know where they are. I don't
propose spending the time to look for
them," said Polk.
This aroused the court to a sense of its
injured dignity and the Justice remarked:
"You will have those books in court on
Monday next at 10 o'clock, Mr. Polk, or I
will have you locked up for contempt of
court."
"But suppose I can't find them?" que
ried Polk.
"I'll send, a deputy sheriff to help you,"
was the answer.
"The deputy sheriff can hunt; I won't,"
said Polk."
"Books or jail," answered Groezinger,
and there the matter rested.
Polk jammed his jaunty straw hat on
his head and bolted out oi court, vowing
that he would go to jail first.

FOB PRESIDENT-
WILLIAM HcKINLET, or Ob to
FOB VICK-PBESIDENTâ
GARRET A. HOBART, of New Jersey
ET.KCTION NOVEMBER 3. 1896.
If the tariff is not an issue how about
the deficit?
The common-sense of the country will
vote for worK and wages this time.
The country is still waiting to hear what
Bryan will do for the workingman.
Democracy fooled tne people once and
may do it again, but not thin time.
What did Democracy ever do for the
producers of this country, anyway?
What the farmer needs is a home mar
ket and protection will give it to him.
There is no profit for the farmer in Bry
anism nor in any other kind of Democ
racy.
This country needs an adequate reve
nue, and it will never get one from the
party of bunglers.
Bryan has not even as much sense as
Cleveland, for Cleveland did not go fishing
until after election.
The worst charge Bryan will have to
meet in the campaign will be the rebound
of his own wild talk.
Buckley's lamb 9 retire from politics in
one place only to break out in another,
and there is no rest for the Junta.
Now that Bryan has shown up as a
fisherman we know how to account for
the length of his campaign yarns.
There was no slump- in prices in this
country until after the free-traders got
into power, and don't forget it.
The pressing question of the campaign
is whether we shall have our raw material
manufactured at home or in Europe.
All the champions of discontent are with
Democracy this year and have succeeded
in making it discontented with itself.
Cockran did not bore a very big hole for
free-traders to crawl into, but perhaps it
is big enough for what is left of them.
Bryan may hide his free-trade card up
his sleeve during tbe canvass, but if he
ever gets elected he will play it for trumps.
Bryan may have made his play of a
fishing trip simply to catch G rover's vote,
for a fellow-feeling makes us wondrous
kinu.
As a matter of practical politics the
chief issue before the people is to turn out
the fiasco fellows and put statesmen in
office.
Every silent mill is a warning against
Democracy, and every idle man who
wants a job in it knows what tbe warning
means.
The Republican party promises protec
tion to your industry against iow wages
and low prices, but what does Democracy
promise ?
With the election of McKinley the re
turn of prosperity will be a certainty, and
that is the reason vrhy all business men
are for him.
If Bourke Cockran's speech was a sample
of the talk of the gold Democrats it is not
strange the free silver fellows gave them
tbe grand shake.
When the election is over and Bryan is
no longer running all the mills will be
running, and then we shall have more
money and less talk.
Genuine bimetallism will be good
money everywhere, but tbe Democratic
proposition is only a counterfeit that
wouldn't be accepted anywhere.
Altgeld, Tillman and Bryan captured
the Democratic camp easily enough, but
they did not manage to capture the stal
warts and won't get their votes.
Between labor and capital there is a
broad unity of interest, and to maintain
and advance that unity is the end and aim
of all the economic legislation of the Re
publican party.
A political party whose leaders cannot
agree on a plan of campaign certainly
could not agree on a policy of govern
ment, so what would be the good of in
trusting them with it ?
The campaign of education for genuine
bimetallism has been so well received by
the people that there is now good reason
for believing Colorado will forsake Teller
and stand by Wolcott and McKinle3\
"For the cause of genuine bimetallism,"
says Tom Reed, "there is much to be said,
but this thing which is now proposed is
against all that makes for the peace, com
fort and prosperity of this country." That
i* the money issue ia a nutshell.
republican Bimetallism.
Speaker Reed addressed the Lincoln Club
of Portland, Me., the other evening. The
beauty of Reed's speeches that they
always have the ring of true Republican
ism. Referring to the money question he
said: "For the cause of genuine bimetal
lism there is much to be said, but this
thing which is now proposed is against all
that makes for the peace, comfort and pros
perity of this country." Mr. Reed might
have said that the'only true bimetallismsâ
the only true friends of silver in this coun
tryâis the Republican party. The Demo
cratic party practically demonetized silver
in 1853. Not more than 8,000,000 standard
silver dollars were coined by our mints
until the Republican party took the work
in hand, and after 1877 it coined over
4.)0,000,000 standard silver dollars. True,
it reduced the output of the mints as soon
as the danger point was about to be reached,
but in every month since 1877 the mints
have turned out more or less silver dollars.
When the silver coinage reached near 10
the volume of gold dollars it was deemed
the wiser course to keep it about so until
an agreement could be Had with the com
mercial nations for a larger use of silver in
international trade. It was no faultofthe
United States that the other nations de
manded that trade balances be paid in gold
or its equivalent, nor would it have been
an exhibition of good business sense to
jeopardize our foreign trade as well as our
gold by keeping on making dollars that
would not be acceptable. So long as we
could protect our silver coinage wi^h gold
commerce everywhere was willing to take
our silver as the equivalent of gold, and
lest onr silver coinage should go beyond
the point of protection the mints were
directed to keep the issue of dollars within
the limits of the treasury's ability to hold
them on a parity with gold.
Now what ttie Republican party aims to
do is to have the commercial nations take
our silver dollars in trade settlements,
without any reference to gold. That is to
say, recognize a silver dollar of and by
itself as the equivalent of a gold dollar.
By such an arrangement the volume of
our metallic money would be increased in
proportion to the silver dollars we coined,
and that, too, without any restriction
being put upon the output. Meanwhile,
however, the Republican party proposes
to keep the coinage of silver dollars down
where their parity with gold can be main
tained. The Democratic party proposes to
throw the mints wide open to silver and
make dollars as fast as they can be made.
The consequence woui J be we should have
to employ gold in all our foreign com
mercial transactions, and, as no gold
would be coming this way, the country
would soon be upon a silver oasis with all
foreign trade destroyed.
SICKLES AND COCKRAN
The speech of Bourke Cockran in New
York on Tuesday evening, while in its
way an eloquent and massive oration, is
Hardly likely to have much effect on tbe
campaign. It appeals only to that small
class of the American people who believe in
the gold standard and free trade, who would
reproduce ia this country the conditions
of England, and who rejoice when tbe
prices ol all products are cheap, no matter
how heavy may be the burden of that
cheapness upon the wage-earner and the
producer.
The people of this country will turn
gladly from the sonorous periods of the
Â«reat advocate of free trade to the simpler
bat more effective speech made on Wednes
day at the National Encampment of Union
veterans at Binghamton, N. V., by Gen
eral Daniel Â£. Sickles. Tbe old veteran of
the war is not so renowned an orator as
the gifted lawyer who spoke for the go!d
Democrats, but to tbe people his words
will seem more eloquent, for they gave
utterance to sentiments of a true Ameri
canism and will find a response in the
hearts of all patriotic citizens.
General Sickles, like Bourke Cockran, is
a Democrat who refuses to accept tbe Chi
cago platform or to support the Chicago
ticket. His opposition, however, is not
based upon tbe ground taken by Cockran
in his iiiucb-herakled speech. In the re
ports that Lave come to us of his address
to the veterans there is no suggestion of a
desire for cheap products. , His argument
seems to have been directed solely to
broad considerations of public welfare and
National honor. He is reported to have
appealed to his old comrades of the war
for the Union to come forward again and
unite for tbe purpose "of putting down
the new spirit of rebellion and repudia
tion" as raised by tbe men who dominated
tbe convention at Chicago and are now
seeking fusion with the Populists.
The logical outcome of Cockran's argu
ment is the nomination of a gold wing
Democratic ticket. There con be no place
in Republican ranks for free-traders and
those who seek to lower still further the
prices of American products and the
profits of American producers. Such men
must perforce organize a party of tbeir
own, and they might as well take the dis
tinctive name of Mugwump and make it a
permanent thing. Very different is the
conclusion of the argument of General
Sickles. He advocates no new party and
seeks no new ticket. He will support Mc-
Kinley. As the issue of the campaign pre
sents itself to his mind, the old soldier
sees but onecourse to pursue. In tbe out
come ot the Chicago convention he be
holds a grave danger threatening tbe Re
public he loves, and he feels that at such
a juncture there should be no division of
the loyal forces. He is for the people, lor
trie country, for the flag, and will fight
under the banner of McKiuley now as loy
ally as McKinley would have fought under
him in the old war days, when McKinley
was a private in the ranks and Sickles
was a general in command.
POPOCKATS IN TROUBLE.
It is very evident that the Democracy
committed a great blunder when it cap
tured tbe Populist National Convention,
or rather when it failed to capture it. Tbe
nomination of Bryan and the rejection\of
Sewall is giving birth to new complications
every day, and the differences which dis
turbed the convention are growing into
bitter hatred. The Populists are deter
mined that Sewall shall withdraw, as the
price of tbeir supnort of Bryan, and
no doubt Bryan would like to see Sewall
taken off the ticket, but Bryan's managers
will not countenance the proposition.
Whether Bryan's refusal to be Mr. SewalPs
guesi after having accepted the invitation
is a straw showing the way the wind is
blowing or net, tbe fact remains that no
denial has been made of the Populist
charge that Bryan was nominated under
an agreement that Sewall would be forced
off the ticket and Watson maae the nom
inee of both parties.
In Texas, North Carolina, Alabama and
Louisiana the Populists are throwing out
feelers to see if they cannot combine with
tbe Republicans on tbe basis of the elec
toral vote for McKinley and the State
offices for the Populists. The Populists
do not Intend that such a trade with Re
publicans should be considered as any re
flection upon Watson, but they do not be

think if they can secure the machinery of
their State government by combiniug with

the Republicans it is good politics to do
it. The meaning: of all this is that the
Populists, of the South more especially,
would rather see Bryan defeated than
elected on a ticket with Sewall.
Senator Allen of Nebraska manipulated
the convention so as to secure Bryan's
nomination, and if there was a promise to
crowd Sewall off the ticket he knows all
about it, but if such a promise was ever
ruaae it was not made in good faith ;
besides, the middle-of-the road Populists
now know, if they did not know before,
that Allen deserted the Democratic party
for Populism at too recent a date to be
trusted implicitly, and the same is true of
Governor Holcomb. Chairman Butler of
the Populist National Committee says in
effect that he has no knowledee of such a
ticket as "Bryan and Sewall"; that th^
Populist ticket is Bryan and Watson, and
that any fusion in any State with Demo
crats that does not indorse Bryan and
Watson will not be recognized. Mean
while the treasury department of the
Democratic National Committee is run
ning upon the rocks of bankruptcy, and
the outlook for relief is dismal and dis
couraeing. The gods are "in it," so to
speak, and the grinding of Bryan and
Sewall is begun.
THE NEEDS OF LABOR.
While it is a fact that the people will
not be satisfied until silver is reinstated
in our monetary system, it is conceded
that no good would come of opening the
mints to the free and unlimited coinage of
the white metal unless there is a demand
for money In the channels of trade and
employment. It would not avail labor
anything to have silver coinage if it could
find no work. It would not benetit the
merchants to have the mints opened to
silver if bis customers had no employ
ment so they could earn money to buy his
goods.
Just so long as we permit foreign coun
tries to supply our markets with commo
dities our own industries will have to re
main in idleness as wiJl their employes,
and consequently it would make no differ
ence how large a volume of circulating
money medium we might have the people
would get none of it. It is foolish to talk
about coining more dollars until our peo
ple are put in a position to earn dollars.
Foreign mills and factories send very few
articles to this country that we could not
manufacture ourselves, but if we do not
manufacture them how is labor to be ben
efited by increasing our money supply?
l.auor cannot buy unless it has employ
ment, and it cannot expect employment
when its product could not compete with
similar product that is permitted to come
in competition with it on the basis of the
lowest possible wages.
If American labor would stop and rea
son it would know that the industries of
this country represent too much money to
remain idle forever. It is altogether to
the interest of our mill and factory own
ers to pay very high wages. The ethical
feature of social life in this country is of
vast importance, for it is the wage class
that is depended upon to stand between
onr institutions and foreign aggression,
and unless this class is protected by the
Nation against attacks upon its opportu
nity to labor at good wages, it would lose
interest in the Government itself. Hence
it is of the utmost importance to our in
dustries and commerce that labor be
encouraged to maintain & higti sense of
duty to the Government.
But if labor will not co-operate with
the owners of industries to keep their
schedule of wages at the highest possible
point by supporting such public measures
as will protect the industries against the
prod uct of the low wage schedule of Europe,
it follows that our mills and factories will
have to be abandoned, or else wages will
have to conform to the wages paid in
other countries. If American labor wants
work at good wages, it must sustain the
source of its employment and wages. It
must demand as its right whatever pro
tection is needed to secure its paymaster
against attack by those who would rob
hinÂ« of his opportunity to pay.
DEMOCRATIC ADVICE.
The advice of Democrat* to Republicans
is that the tariff question should be elim
inated from the campaign and the money
question be made the only issue. The ad
vice is quite gratuitous, and will not be
heeded. There are reasons plenty wby
the Democracy should want nothing said
about the tariff, but there are too many
idle wage-earners and too many idle indus
trial plants crying out to be delivered from
Democratic tariff tinkering for the Repub
lican party to be silent.
Until the Wilson act became operative
labor had all engagements it wanted, and
wages were highly remunerative, but for
two years and a half the most conspicuous
feature of America's industrial life has
been cold furnace?, idle machinery and
hungry men and women and children.
No, this is not the time to "let the tariff
question rest." On the contrary, it is the
paramount issue before the people, and
without it the campaign would be as
meaningless as the play of ''Hamlet"
would be with the Dane left out of the cast.
The Republican party realizes fully the
importance of the money question and it
proposes to give it all the consideration
required, but it is good business sense
to lirst start the money-making enterprise
and look after the money vhen there is
business to do. The Republican party is
committed to bimetallism, but its lirst
purpose is to get the commerce and the
industries of tbe country in shape to use
money. No doubt there will be great
activity in sbop, mill end factory as soon
as Major McKinley's election is assured
beyond a donbt, for the people will know
that tbe adjustment of the money ques
tion is sure to follow close upon the heels
of the resumption of business in the now
inactive channels of trade and traffic.
No close observer of events during the
past fortnight has failed to detect a grow
ing sentiment that the tariff qnestion
needs the Government's attention before
anything else. Not that there is any
yielding to the demand for the reinstate
ment of the silver dollar as redemption
money, but labor and capital are begin
ning to see that free silver coinage alone
would not start the wheels of industry,
and hence labor and capital are now dei
manding that the present free-trade law
be repealed and something as good as the
act of 1890 be substituted for it. After
that public sentiment will want a bime
tallic currency established as soon as
possible.
A RIGHT MOVE.
The mercantile and manufacturing as
sociations of San Francisco have started a
movement to increase the foreign com
merce of this City. It is a good and timely
endeavor to secure that which legitimately
belongs to this trade center, and no doubt
the effort will have the substantial sup
port of all the business enterprise of San
Francisco. The plan is to send represen
tative business men to the several trad*
centers of the countries that are naturally
tributary to San Francisco and solicit
closer commercial relations with them.
That the plan is feasible there is do
douot whatever. New York and other
Atlantic coast points, as well as Chicago
and other interior trade center?, have
built up an enormous commerce with
South America, more especially by send
ing representative merchants and manu
facturers to explain the advantages of
their cities as markets in which to sell and
buy. The expense of such ventures is
nothing in comparison to tne good results
that accrue, and it is to be hoped that San
Francisco will profit by the experience of
Eastern cities and speedily undertake the
enterprise.
If a large commerce 'were established
between this City and foreign markets, the
necessity for a merchant marine and new
reciprocal trade relations would be the
strongest argument that could be sub
mitted to Congress by Government en
couragement, both in legislation and
subsidies. The possibilities of San Fran
cisco as a center for the accumulation and
distribution of commercial commodities
are practically without limit, but we must
go and possess ourselves of the business if
we would have it.

AN UNRELIABLE FINANCIAL BA
ROMETER.
l.os Angeles Times.
In 1892, when Mr. Bryan was opposing the
McKinley tariff, and indulging in mixed met
aphore of crosses of gold and crowns of thorns,
he asserted that one of the many advantages
that would result from free trade would be to
"lower prices" on ail the necessaries of life.
To-day he is vociferating with all the strength
of a foghorn that the country must have free
silver to "raise prices." One year he is for
lowering prices, and the next for raising
prices. One year he knows thi*. and the next
he knows that, all of which goes to show that
Mr. Bryan knows nothing at all about it. He
is the veriest tyro In statesmanship that this or
any other known couutry has ever yet pro
duced,
AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
Deputy Sheriff Earl Dageett of Tulare. the
young official who had the terrible hand-to
hand guniight with Bandit Dan McCall on a
Southern Pacific engine, near Visalia, last
March, is at tne Lick.
Mr. Dageett is the youngest deputy sheriff in
the world, so far as is now known. Ue was
formerly a student at Berkeley, and completed
his freshman year there in 1893. He was too
young to vote for his chief last election, not
being 21 till November 13 last. He went into
office in January after.andhad the thrilling ex
perience which made his name famous over
the coast exactly five months ago last night.
Daggett is a spare built, tall and beardless
young man.
He told how he and Deputy Sheriff G. B.
Reed had heard that Bandits Dan McCall and
Si Lovren were to attemDt to rob the train
that night, and they got on the engine expect
ing the highwaymen would flag it.
Instead of this, however, they had boarded
the train and came on the blind baggage to the
engine.
"They covered the engineer and fireman,"

said Daggett, "and shot Reed through the left
shoulder. As I turned around McCall shot
me. and I shot him with forty-two buckshot,
letting go both barrels of my shotgun at once.
"Did he ever know what was the matter
with him? Never. He never felt it. I maae a i
holo in him that you could stick both arms [
through. He didn't know I hit him.
"As to his shot which struck me, it hit me
on the right side, broke two ribs and carried a
piece of one and several thicknesses of cloth
through me, grazing my liver and passing out
about an inch from my backbone.
"The thing didn't hurt me at all at first. It
felt just like a splash of ice water, the lead was
bo cold. But I thought the wound was ie my
groin, and as I contemplated it I thought it
was all day with me. But later, when I found
out where I was hit I knew I was all right, for
I had studied anatomy enough to figure out
that my vital parts had not been struck.
"Did I suffer afterward? Yes, a thousand
deaths. They fed me on morphine till no
amount had the slightest effect on me. But I
got through it at last, and I had the satisfac
tion of seeing Si Lovren, who survived and
who was arrested, sent to the penitentiary for
life. Deputy Sheriff Reed wasn't hurt much.
He was up and around in three days."
Deputy Daggett is taking a rest here and en
joying the cool weather, under whose influ

PRESS THE TARIFF ISSUE.
New York Recerder.
There is a consensus of opinion among the
shrewdest political observers in the West and
in some of the Southern States that the people
are turning to the question of protection as
the paramount issue of the campaign. The
Recorder has all along predicted that such
would be the fact when the Populist clamor at
Chicago and St. Louis had expended its wild,
unreasoning force and the tornado of talk was
at an end.
Not a day should be lost in pressing the tariff
issue. It should be heard in the press and on
the platform from now on forcibly, vigorously,
eloquently. The vicious teaching of the Dem
ocratic organs and orators on this question for
four years is the poison that must be eradi
cated from the minds of the voters â farmers
and artisans alike.
Grover Cleveland, more than any other man,
disseminated the economic leprosy of free
trade. 1 1 is idle to hope that he and his friends
will move a hand to remedy the evil they pro
duced. It would moan self-stultification on
their part. They are now playing into Bryan's
hands by discussing issues which they and
tney alone have been instrumental in raising.

a chaperone wants a position, and says of her
self:

WILSON LAW AND McKINLEY
LAW.
Chicago Inter Ocean.
The title of the McKinley law is: "Ad act to
reduce revenue and to equalize duties on im
ports, and for other purposes." Nevertheless,
it was assailed by the Democratic press as
though it were an act to Increase revenues at
The Hydrocyclc in Operation.
a time when the prudent administration of
affairs by Republican Presidents and Con
gresses had created a yearly surplus. It accom
plished its purpose by reducing or repealing
tariff duties on such manufactures as by a
long course of protection had become wholly
or partially self-sustaining and by adding to
the duties on industries that evidently, needed
more protection.
Thus it increased the duty on tinplate, and
by so doingcreated an American industry that
gave employment to thousands. It reduced
the duties on most forms of manufactured
iron. It increased the duties on pottery ware
and gave a new impetus to ceramic art in the
United States. It increased the duty on wools
and multiplied the flocks and fleeces of the
country. It added to the duty on shoddy aiid
by so doing well nigh banished that filthy and
disease-engendering substitute for wool from
the Americau market. It repealed the duty
on sugar, and by so doing it brought sugar
down to ''twenty pounds for a dollar," for the
first time in American history. But while
cheapening the price to the consumer by re
peal ot the duty, it stimulated the production
by a bounty upon every pound of maple, beet,
sorghum or cane sugar made in the United
States; this bouuty, virtually, if not specifi
cally, was payable out of the surplus of rev
enue that remained after the reduction of
duties ,
It cannot be too clearly understood that the
McKinley law did not add to the volume of
revenue; it reduced it. Its merit lay in Its
wise and equitable readjustment of tariff
duties. It admitted a larger number of ar
ticles to the free list than any previous tariff
law had done. It strengthened the weaker in
dustries, while it withdrew some measure of
aid from the stronger ones. It was the most
equitable revenue Taw ever devised.
The men that repealed it nave brought a

The Los Angeles Herald heads an article,
"Good Times Coming with the Manufacture of
Beet Sugar." True enough. Good times will
come with the operation of all our manufac
tories, no matter of what character. But the
Herald and its political confreres have done
all they could to stop factoriesâ beet sugar
and all other kinds. Its free trade heresies
open up and run factoriesâ in foreign coun
tries. The Republican protection policy opens
and runs factories on American soil and by
American citizens. Which is the true policy?
THE HYDROCYCLE.
Most people prefer to call the hydrocycle the
â water bicycle. The first factory for its manu
facture is in operation in Washington on the
banks of the Potomac River.
L. V. Moulton, a Grand Rapids (Mich.) man,
invented It, says the Chicago News. He is alto
the inventor of the machine for sewing but
tons on shoes. The hydrocycle is a machine
about ten feet long and carries two passen
gers. The lower part is two cigar-shaped cylin
ders of galvanized steel painted black. At the
end oÂ£ the cylinder is a small rudder, which
can be moved at will by the person on the seat.
The cylinders are light and are fastened to
gether by transverse steel bars on which is laid
a floor of galvanized zinc curving up in front
like a toboggan.
A faw feet behind the curving prow is the
seat, which is nothing but a strong chair of
wood firmly fastened in place. This is the
passenger's seat, and back of it is the bicycle
seat, where sits the driver, his feet resting on
pedals, whose chains run from the cranks to
the wheelhouse in the stern of the machine
The handlebars in front of the driver are used'
to guide the rudders. At the rear of the ma
chine is the wheel which propels the affair. It
is a double one, with eight paddles fashioned
like the paddle-wheels in river steamers.
There are lights for use at night and the pas
senger can help the driver by working cranks
with his hands. The whole affair weighs 225
Sounds and can attain a speed of ten miles an
our without much exertion on the part of the
riders. The machine cannot be upset on ac
count of the distance between the cylinders.

"As idle as a painted ship upon a

The bark Martha Davis is now out
thirty-six days from Honolulu and people
along the water front are pitying Captain
Soule. He was to have been in Washing
ton, D. C, last week to be married, but
the wind aud weather are against him
and the stout bark is still drifting around
between the islands and the coast.
The brig 8. G. Irwin arrived from Hono
lulu yesterday after a twenty-fonr days'
passage. Captain Williams says that
nothing was encountered save light winds
and calms, and that for days the brig did
not make a mile an hour. He did not
speak the Martha Davis, but says that if
Captain Soule has experienced the same
weather as his vessel did it may be a week
before he gets in. Should the bark not
get in before next week she will have
made one of the longest trips on record
from Honolulu to San Francisco.
When the Martha Davis reaches San
Francisco she will be laid up or sold.
Portland has cut into the San Francisco

The accompanying cut shows the bark
in a dead calm. Captain Soule, knowing
that his wedding-day was at hand and
that He was still hundreds of miles from
land, has. according to Mr. Coulter, char
tered a seagull to carry his love a message.
The Harbor Commissioners held an
other lively session yesterday. At the
last meeting it was decided to pive the
whole of Jackson-street wharf to the fruit
men. The Sacramento Transfer Com
pany, the Napa Company and the San
Quentin boats were ordered to move to
Pacific, but they refused to obey the Chief
Wharfinger. They pointed out that for
twenty-rive years and over they had been
docking at Jackson street and that all
their business came to that point and to
move would be a hardship.
When the board met yesterday Major
P. J. Harney of the Sacramento Trans
portation Company, Captain Leale of the
Caroline and Captain Wolfe of the
steamers Napa City and Zinfandel were
on hand to oppose the move. They
pointed out that an injustice was being
done them and the commission recon
sidered its action.
All the boats named will remain at
Jackson street, but the iruitmen will bo
compelled to remove the shipments as
soon as they arrive and the wharf will no
more be used as a warehonse. At the
present time there is an enormous stock
of empty boxes on the wharf, and they
will be moved to-day. If not by the
owners they will be by the Chief Wharf
inger, and some one will have to pay for
the moving.

office pay rent. In future all the others

Owing to a slight error in his calcula
tions, the late A. Page Brown has put the

the loss could not be collected from the

A gang of petty burglars have been at
work on the water front for some weeks

tney expect to run the thieves to earth in
a few days.
Benjamin Pincus was locked up in the
Harbor police station yesterday for dis
turbing the peace. Commission Merchant
Riley, who was standing on Washington
street wharf, remarked that Clerk Sulli
van, who was near by, could throw a
potato from where they were standing
over the Jackson-street shed. "I'll bet
$20 to $5 he can't," said Pincus. The bet
was made and Sullivan, choosing a small
potato, sent it over the intervening space,
over the Jackson-street shed and into the
slip beyond. Riley divided the $20 with
Sullivan, and then the row began. Pincus
swore he had been robbed, and wanted his
money back. To soothe him $10 was re
funded, but that only made him the more
eager to get the remainder. He finally
showed right, and was arrested. He is
now out $10 and will have to answer the
charge of disturbing the peace to-day.
PREPARING THE PAVILION,
New and Attractive Stands Are
Being Built for the
Exhibitors.
The Coming Fair Will Be Better
Than Former Onesâ All the
Space Taken.
The work of preparation for the opening
of the twenty-ninth Industrial Exposition
of the Mechanics' Institute is going rap
idly on, and long before September 1 the
Pavilion will be filled with exhibits. Su
perintendent J. H. Gilmore states that
never before have exhibitors been so prompt
in choosing space and getting their arti
cles into shape for the opening day.
As yet the decoration and arrangement
of the great hall has only commenced,
but enough has been done t<j show how
attractive the interior of the building will
be. The ceiling of the concave roof has
been covered in red, and a draping of or
ange and blue is going up at the sides. The
effect of these colors under hundreds of
electric lights will be exceedingly beautiful.
Work has begun in the booths, pagodas,
temples and stands which are to occupy
the main floor.
One of the most striking construction is
a soap temple 14x18 feet, the exhibits of
Fishbeck <fe Glootz. The ornamental base,
tesselated floor, columns, frieze and dome
are molded from the soft, plastic material.
The unique affair will be brilliantly illu
minated. M. F. Bradley is the arcuitect.
Tillmann & Bendel, grocers, are building
a large Egyptian structure surmounted
by four sphinxes in which to place their
exhibits.
W. W. Fuller will erect a mirror temple,
and the Standard Biscuit Company is
building an ornamental stand at the west
end of the nave.
Warner & Maddox have put together a
fireproof construction showing ceilings,
arches, partitions, etc., in the non-com
bustible material. The Cook Belting Com
pany will exhibit in a rustic booth built
near the entrance from an attractive de
sign.
The Pavilion roanasrement have placed
no restriction upon exhibitors, but will
permit them to follow out their own pleas
ure in regard to designs, dimensions and
material, and the result will be a pleasing
variety among the exhibition stands.
The State Fish Commission will exhibit
a number of glass tanks filled with rare
fish and a hatchery in operation.

plaints.
CASES TO BB SET SATURDAY.
Action of the Court Spoken of Dis
paragingly Jnst Outside of the
Courtroom.
Justice of the Peace Carroll presided in
Judge Conlan's police court yesterday.
JuÃt before noon, after cases of many
sorts had been disp<sed of, the cases of
the Socialists who were arrested last Sat
urday night at the corner of Seventh and
Market streets came up. All of those who
were taken into custody at that time and
place were in court and they were accom
panied by Attorneys Monteith and Has
kell.
The charges against them were obstruct
ing the sidewalk and disturbing the peace.
When they were arrested they were tak
ing part in a gathering at which the
principles of socialism were being ex
pounded. The trustees of the Odd Fel
lows' Association were meeting in the
Odd Fellows' building, at the corner of
Seventh and Market streets, at the time,
and the noise made by the speakers and
attendants at the Socialists' meeting in
terfered with their deliberations.
The police officers who made the arrests
were Whaien, O'Connor and Jackson.
They were in court yesterday, and there
were also present a number of members of
the Socialistic party to the number of two
score or more, who ware interested specta
tors and auditors when the cases were
called.
Mr. Monteith was the Vflrst to speak for
the Socialists, and at once\moved that the
case against William Costley, who was
first named on the calendar, should be dis
missed. The ground upon which he based
this motion was that the warrant set up
that Costley was obstructing the sidewalk
when a public meeting was not being held.
Now, the contrary was, according to Mr.
Monteith's information and belief, the
fact, for a public meeting was in progress
when the police came, and there were
many persons in attendance who were
listening to the speeches which were being
made.
Mr. Monteith declared that the com
plaint was false and fraudulent and con
tained perjury. He asserted again that
the arrests were made at a public meeting
and offered to prove by the testimony of
the complaining witness, Officer Whaien,
that the complaint was n-jt true. "The
complaining witness will say," said Mr.
Monteith, with a show of considerable
warmth, "if he is put on the stand, that
when these arrest were made there was iv
progress a public meeting at which they
were in attendance."
Judge Carroll denied the motion to dis
miss and an exception was taken.
Mr. Haskell then spoke as counsel, and
with even more heat than had been mani
fested by Mr. Monteith demanded an in
stant trial.
"These men are poor and work for a
living; they are here to-day and we are
ready to co on. To compel these men to
come back again would entail hardship
because they would lose their work again."
Mr. Haskell also denounced the complaint
as fraudulent, and said: ''We shall de
mand a jury trial in every one of these
cases. We will not consent that one roan
shall be tried by the court and that all the
others shall be adjudged by the testimony
in one case." Mr. Haskell asked to pro
ceed with the hearing at once.
Justice Carroll said that it would be
impossible to go on witn a jury trial then.
A venire must issue and it would take
time to get together the jury and added
that there is a jury trial which would come
on in the afternoon.
Mr. Monteith said: "We want to give
the officer a chance, at this time, to cor
rect his statement made in the complaint
as to whether there was a public meeting
when these arrests were made. We de
mand a public trial at once."
Justice Carroll said that a jury was not
present.
"We are ready to proceed, and we are
willing to take any twelve men in this
room as jurors," said Mr. Monteith.
Justice Carroll said that he would put
tne entire matter over until Saturday
morning, when he would set the case for
trial.
The Socialists and their attorneys then
left the courtroom and gathered in the
corridor outside, where they discussed the
situation and tbe proceedings in the court
room. Mr. Monteith declared that the
action of the court was "outrageous," and
in this opinion several of his clients con
curred. Those who are held to appear
Saturday morning next on account of the
happenings at the corner of Seventh and
Market streets are as follows: William
Costley, E. T. Kingsley, George Speed,
George Aspden, M. Speeney, J. Poster and
E. Lux. '
UNLAWFUL BUSINESS.
No Amount of Police Toleration Can
Legalize the Letting of Premises
for Immoral Purposes.
The Supreme Court gave a little rap to
the Police Department of this City in a
decision handed down yesterday. The
case was that of Charles A. Chateau
against Justin Singla, the plaintiff asking
for the dissolution of a copartnership
formed for the purpose of furniahing and
letting certain premises for immoral pur
poses.
Singla opposed the petition on the
ground that the courts could not inter
vene, since the business carried on by ihe
partners was illegal. The Superior Court,
however, sustained the legality of the
partnership, since the police authorities
permitted the business in question to be
carried on in that quarter of the City in
which the premises were located, and pro
ceeded to the dissolution of the copartner
ship and the appointment of a receiver.
On appeal by Chateau the point made
by him in the lower court is sustained, the
business being held illegal and the matter
referred to the lower tribunal for further
action. In rendering the decision the
Supreme Court says :
Public policy Is not made or unmade by the
actions or omissions of a Police Department,
nor will it be contended that the Police De
partment may abrogate a penal statute or
annul an espress mandate of law.
iew to-day:
We arc going to lose lots
of money unless our tea is

money back if you don't

that means giving tea for

THE LONG DISTANCE SERVICE.
How Conversation Between New York
and San Francisco Could Be
Established.
The field of reduction on this coast over
winch the recently cut rates of the
Western Union Telegraph Company ex
tend, embraces many important stations
within tbe range of the Sunset Telephone
and Telegraph Company's service. It is
highly probable, in fact it is admitted,
that the Western Union reduction will be
followed by a scaling down of charges for
telephone service in the same area.
In replying to inouiries on behalf of The
Call yesterday Louis Glass, manager of
fhe Sunset Company, remarked that the
Western Union and the telephone com
pany did not enter into direct competi
tion. The written message transmitted
over the wire was usually the announce
ment of a definite proposition. The con
versation conducted through the medium
of the telephone frequently related to
matters of negotiation.
As an example he said a merchant of
San Francisco might call up Johnson of
Los Angeles and ascertain from the latter
if a carJoad of oranges of a certain grade
could be immediately obtained and
shipped tbe same day. Johnson might
reply in the affirmative, ana the two
would thus close up the business transac
tion in two minutes' conversation. Lead
ing firms had a Sunset wire running di
rectly to the office, and experts in this
form of communication were employed.
Mr, Glass called up Los Angeles to give
the reporter an object lesson. The long
distance did not perceptibly diminish the
distinctness of the conversation.
When Mr. Glass was asked if the tele
phone company would meet the reduction
announced by the Western Union, he said
In all probability it would. He recognized
that reduction of rates increased the vol
ume of business. He said further:
"We have during the past two years ex
pended $700,000 on territorial extension
outside of cities and towns. Between this
City and San Jose we have fourteen pairs
of wires. We have two complete loons to
Los Aneeles and four loops from Santa
Barbara to Los Angeles. The greater the
distance is the heavier the copper wire
must be. With copper wire of sufficient
weight direct conversation between
New York and San Francisco could be
maintained. It is now conducted directly
between Portland, Me., and Minneapolis,
a distance of 1500 or 1600 miles."
The wjire used between San Francisco
and Los Angeles weighs 520 pounds to the
mile. The poles, placed fifty to the mile,
cost about $20 each. The wire is worth
\Ki\i cents a pound. The cost of setting
the poles, etc., brings up the total cost of
construction per mile to $1500. The life
of a $20 pole is from ten to twelve years.
In the telephone business the company
is not bound by the Jaw of liability which
applies to the telegraph service. Usually
the persons conducting the conversation
know each other's voice. What is said in tne
conversation over the wire is known only
to the persons talkine. When the parties
are connected the responsibility of the
telephone company ends.

FARMERS PROSPER BEST UNDER PROTECTION.
It has long been the consensus of opin
ion among the students of economic sub
jects in the United States that whatever
affects the farmer vitaliy must be the final
test of what most directly influences the
mas&es. In an article in The Call of
Wednesday it was shown in a general way
that without the protection of a reason
able, tariff farmers suffer untold miseries;
that they are unable to sell their products
afar or to meet with a living price for
products in the United States. It is not
necessary to go into minute details to
show that some such tariff as thdt set
â  forth in the McKinley bill is practically
the only protection the farmer and horti
culturist of tne United States have
against the markets of the world, particu
larly ftgainst the cheap wheat of India
and the Argentine Republic.
It is well known that the grain fields of
India and the Argentines severely com
pete with the United States, and those
who have studied the question closest
know that a wise protective tariff is the
one Gibraltar of the United States.
It should be fully understood that the
heavy staples are not the only articles af
fected favorably or unfavorably by the
" tariff. So small a thing as eggs derive a
great benefit from the doctrines of protec
tion. It was shown by Charles R. Buck
land in the American Economist not long
ago that there is no industry more fatally
affected by the tariff than eggs. Among
otner things he said :
Let us look back for a period of ten yearsâ
from 1883 to 1893. Between 1883 and 1890
there was no tariff upon eggs. The hen prod
uct of the American farmer, raised by the
American farmer's wife, was sold in the Amer
ican markets in open competition with the
eggs laid in Canada, in Austria, Belgium,
China, Denmark, France, Germany, England,
Scotland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Nether
lands and Cuba. This will be a surprise to
many farmers, but it is a fact nevertheless.
Let us now see to what extent the McKinley
tariff by putting a duty on eggs has protected
ELOQUENT APPEAL
TO ALL VETERANS,
Ten Thousand Circulars
Sent to Soldiers and
Sailors.
JOB COMRADE M'KINLEY
Army and Navy Republican
League Fires the First Gun
for Victory.
THE CAUSE IS PURE POLITICS.
O.i Warriors Again Summoned for
the Honor of the Conntry and
Glory cf the Flag.
The Army and Navy Republican League
of California, through Geaeral Robert A.
Friedrich, its commander-in-chief, has
issued an appeal to the Union soldiers and
sailors to support their late comrade in
arms, Major McKinley.
Ten thousand circulars will be dis
tributed to-day.
"As in the days of '61," the circular
state?, "the people look to you to stand
for the honor of the country and the glory
of the nae."'
On tte first page in large letters is the
command and appeal, "Ex- Union Soldiers
and Sailors to the Front." Following
this is a letter to the Union soldiers and
sailors of California. It reads in part as
follows:
Comradesâ The battle for the restoration of
the country to that condition of prosperity and
hai i'iness in which it was turned over to
Democratic rule four years ago, and to save it j
irom National dishonor, repudiation and
anarchy, is on.
In every part of the United States our com
rades, disregarding past party affiliations and i
actuated soiely from a high sense of patriotic j
duty, making loyaity to and love of the Uniou
paramount to every other consideration, are
coming to the front and pledging their un
wavering support to William McKinley and
the great principles of protection, prosperity
and National integrity which he represents
and -personifies.
They see and realize the danger which
menaces the welfare and perpetuity ot the
Union if the wild and reckless theories advo
cated by those nominated on the Chicago plat
furm should prevail.
The letter further recites that on the Bth
in^t., in New York, a meeting of distin- i
guished soldiers was held and an organiz- !
ation effected for the purpose oi aiding in !
the election of McKinley. Among them |
was that old battle-scarred hero, General \
Daniel E. Sickles, always a Democrat; I
General Franz Siegei, Horace Porter, L.
Edwin Dudley, Oliver O. Howard and '
seventy-live lormer major-generals and j
officers" of the Union army.
Another letter succeeding this is di- i
rected to the surviving soldiers and sailors '
who served in the Union army and navy
during the war of the Rebellion; it states: i
Comradesâ Your country is again in peril. I
In the Presidential campaign dangerous com- j
binations again threaten the integrity of the !
Government. Misguided and unscrupulous
men conspire to bring repudiation, dishonor
and financial ruin upon the Nation once saved i
by your valor.
Comrades, you believe in liberty under law;
in ii,i blic order; in the maintenance oJ our
courts of justice and in National honor and
good faith. You are unalterably opposed to j
the red flag of anarchy and mob rule. We be
lieve that you resent with earnestness all at- {
tucks upon the executive and judicial acpart
nu-nts of our Government and commend all j
measures which vindicate the supremacy of i
the law and restore public order whenever en
dangered. Should this dangerous and revolu
tionary conspiracy against the financial honor j
and integrity of the Government succeed |
every pensioner, every depositor in savings
banks, every policy-holder in any company,
co-operative and building and loan association I
and assessment society would lose one-half of j
wiiat is due him by being paid 50-cent silver |
dollars.
Continuing, the circular quotes a letter j
wr.tten to a comrade by General Sickles,
speaking of McKinley's admirable military
record and one to whom every soldier
should look with pride.
The declaration of the late Republican j
convention on the subject of pensions and
the rights of soldiers follows. This is put
in strong contrast to the declaration of the
Democratic piatform, which says:
We heartily indorse the rule of the present
Commissioner of Pensions that no name snail
be arbitrarily dropped from the pension roll.
Commenting on this tiie circular says:
Can any soldier be deceived by this misera
ble subterfuge and lie? It is an insult to your j
intelligence. Is not this just what Mr. Com- I
missioner of Pensions is and has been doingâ I
dropping worthy soldiers arbitrarily from the I
pension rolls by hundreds, after a farce of an !
investigation by his inspired Hppoiniees? Is!
there any pledge of future legislation in the
platform for the soldier or sailor? Its there anY
promise of employment or recognition 9 Head
the two platforms and judge lor yourselves.
Tbe circular concludes with a brief
sketch of McKinley's army career.

This is a remarkable exhibit. We find dur
ing the eight years, from 1883 to 1890, when
we had free trade in eggs, that we iniDorted
on an average more than 15,500,000 dozen
eggs every yearâ over 124,515,000 dozen of
foreign eges sold in this country in rich t
years. What an enermous quantity! What
did they cost? During the eight years we paid
away to foreign farmers more than $18,770,
--000 for eggs alone in good American money.
We paid away over $2,596,000 every year for
foreign eggs; almost $50,000 every week of
the eight years sent abroad to foreign farmers!
This was what free trade did.
Continuing in the same line with argu
ments unanswerable Mr. Buckland, after
adducing many tables, says:
Most of the foreign eggs that we have im
ported came from Canada, and, now that there
is to be no more protection for American eggs,
we must expect to pay out millions of dollars
again every year /or foreign eggs. It may be
asked why the American farmers cannot sell

BULLETS WENT WIDE.
A Saloon-Keeper Fired At Twice by
Thomas Dolan and Fortun
ately Escape*.
Thomas Doian, a "dope fiend," got on
the warpath yesterday, and he is now in
the City Prison on a charge of assault
with a deadly weapon.
Early yesterday morning be went into
the saloon at 717 Howard street and got a
revolver which he had left there. He and
the barkeeper had some words and Dolan
smashed a window and several other
articles.
About 1 o'clock yesterday afternoon he
went into White's saloon on Hunt and
Third streets, accompanied by a friend.
He ordered two drinks, but would only pay
for one. White remonstrated with him, and
he began to hammer on the counter.
White told him to make less noise, and
with an oath he pulled a revolver out of
his pocket and fired two shots at White,
the bullets passing between White and a
customer, fortunately not striking either
of them.
Doian ran out of the saloon, up Third
street and into Sherwood place, whÂ°re he
was overtaken by Policeman Tyrrell and
placed under arrest. In his flight he
threw away the revolver, and it was picked
up by William Docherty.
When searched at the Southern police
station a gold watch, a silver watch, a pawn
ticket for another watch and $60 were found
in his pockets. Detective Ryan is investi
gating as to now Dolan became possessed
of so many watches. y
UNPROTECTED FROM FIRE
The Chemical Engine Has Been
Removed From North
Beach.
Indignant Citizns Will Hold a Mass*
Meeting to Protest Against
This Action
The residents of the Second Ward, that
part of the City commonly called North
Beach, which lies between Russian and
Telegraph hills, from Broadway north to
the bay, have a serious grievance against
| the Fire Department authorities. The
! chemical engine that was located on Stock
ton street has been removed to the Broad
way engine-house and the entire large dis
trict mentioned is practically unprotected.
The propefty-owners of the Second Ward
do not propose to submit to this injustice,
and the case will soon be discussed at a
Kenerai mass or indignation meeting. It
is proposed to draw up resolutions con
i denining the Fire Decartment for remov
â  ing the chemical engine from its sphere of
! usefulness; also to appoint a committee
I to present the resolutions to the Board of
I Fire Commissioners and demand that tbe
j engine in question be returned to its former
location.
One of the residents of the district who
i owns considerable property there summed
I apt c situation in this way:
"We who live here and own property in
! this ward consider the removal of the
I chemical engine from Stockton and Fil
bert streets as an outrage. The engine
was taken over to Broadway to protect
i Chinatown, whicu everybody would like
! to see wiped out by fire.
"In case of a fire in the middle of this
i district we would have to wait for a long
time for the arrival of the engines from
j Broadway or the engine-house down on
I Francisco street. The latter engine can
not climb hills to any advantage even
with its three big horses, and as it is lo
cated at the foot of the hill half of tbe
: ward would burn up before a single stream
i of water could be started.
"North Beach is the eldest part of the City
! and all of its buildings while still good
i are old-time woclen structures that burn
like matches. Let a fire start at tbe foot
of either of the hills during the high
j winds we have and thousands of dollars'
worth of property would be destroyed, to
say nothing of the hundreds of people
{ who would be made homeless.
"The chemical engine on several occa
! sions prevented large fires on the hills
i because it was light and could run with
i ease to places where tbe big steamers
could not get without great difficulty and
delay.
"To add to the offense to the people here
| District Engineer Shaughnessey has
| mored his family into tbe upper story of
the old chemical engine-house.
"What right has he to use the City's
property in order to save house rent,
which so many of the taxpayers have to
pay ? Speaking of taxes, we pay as large
taxes as people in the other parts of tbe
City and are entitled to as much protec
tion from fire as any one.
"This mass-meeting, or indignation
meeting, movement is being inaugurated
by all the large property-owners of the
district. We want the chemical engine
oack and if we don't get it we will know
why."

their eggs in Canada. There are two reasons
why they cannot. Tnere are but half a dozen
small markets in that country, with a total
population only one-fourth as large as New
York City. This is one reason. The other rea
son is that Canada protects her farmers by a
tax of 5 cents per dozen on American eggs so
as to prevent American farmers from selling
there. The McKinley tariff protected our
farmers, but the free-trade Wilson tariff does
not. The free-trade tariff throws the American
markets open free to the Canadian farmers,
while the Canadians tax the American farm
ers. The Canadians protect themselves, but
the Wilson bill of the free-trade party will not
protect the American farmer's egg basket.
Perhaps one of the most important
views of the question ever presented was
that of Joseph Nimmo Jr. in an article on
the tariff as it affects New York. Having
studied the question closely, ne said:
After all that had been accomplished by a
changed and exceedingly refined agriculture
and by tariff protection, the struggle was a
hard one for the great majority of our farmers,
and it was growing harder and harder mainly
as a result of the cheap and discriminating
freight rates afforded by Canadian railroads
and their connections to Canadian farmers
who, with the additional advantages of
cheaper labor, were enabled to compete act
ively with our own farmers in the markets of
New York City, Brooklyn, Albany, Buffalo and
Rochester, and in the markets of almost all the
principal towns and cities of the State. West
ern State competition is inevitable, under the
absolute freedom of trade and industry which
constitutes the most striking feature of our
National unity, and it is submitted to without
a murmur.
But, in considering Canadian competition,

THE GOLD BULLION BAR.
I recovered, arrived here yesterday by ex- ]
press from the company's agent at San i
Diego, and is now safe in the bands of its '
I proper owners.
The story ot the theft and ultimate re-
I covery of this precious bar of bullion is of
! more than ordinary interest, and reads
almoÃt like fiction. The bar like many '
others of its kind left the company's
mines at Calmalli, Lower California, on
March 15, 1895, and was transported on a
packmule to Santo Domingo, whence it
was shipped by the company's schooner
Anita to Ensenada, and there given in I
charge of their agent, Manuel Riveroll, for â 
him to ship to San Diego by steamer.
Riveroll placed it in his safe, and that {
night the safe was opened by the com- |
bination and the bar stolen. The same i
night the safe of the Bank of Ensenada i
was opened the same way, and consider
able gold and silver coin taken. Riveroll
reported the loss of the bar to tbe authori
ties the next day,' and was himself ar
rested on suspicion, as was also his book
keeper, Allen Pratt, they being the only .
ones who knew the combination. J. M.
Garrett, a great friend of Pratt's, and who j
was a sort of idler around the town, was !
alao arrested, together with the cashier of !
tbe bank, Jackson.
Nothine could be learned from the sus
pects, however, and no trace whatever of
the missing bar or the money taken from
the bank could be tound. Jackson was
released from custody, and after four
months Riveroll was given his freedom.
He bad suffered greatly by the close con
nnement, and to add to his misfortunes
his wife bad died during his imprison
ment and he had lost all his agencies and
business and mortgaged all his property
to the mining company to make good the
loss of the $12,000 bar.
Sixteen months afteÂ» the bar was stolen,
some time during last month, Pratt and
Garrett were tried for the thett of the bar
and released for want of evidence. Their j
confinement told on them, for they had i
been cast into a prison that was far from
healthy and had been forced to mingle
with Indians, Mexicans and other crimi
nals. Both were about broken down in
health.
Pratt came to ban Francisco and is now
employed in an insurance company here.
Garrett went to Los Angeles and then to I
San Diego, and caused to be published in f
the papers there some exceed ngly bitter j
things about the Mexican Government
and of their treatment while in confine
{ ment there. Riveroll had always Been
j suspicious that Garrett was the real thief,
we are forced by every motive of patriotism,
of pecuniary interest and self-respect, to re
member that "this Nation was founded by a
union of States for the purpose of presenting
to foreign powers an unbroken front." Be
sides, the protection of American agricultural
interests agamst Canadian competition is
clearly suggested and justified by the ag
gressive commercial policy which has been
pursued by Canada toward the United States
during the last lorty years from the Banks of
Newfoundland to the Straits of San Juan de
Fuca, and especially toward the State of New
York. The Canadian canal system was con
ceived and completed with the sole object in
view of diverting Western Siate commerce
from New York transportation lines and irom
New York trade centers. President Harrison
has just brought the insolent Dominion Gov
ernment to terms for a discrimination against
New York ports on Lake Ontario and on the
St. Lawrence River in violation of the express
proviKionu of the treaty of Washington, ratified
in 1871.
Besides, Canadian railroads and their con
nections in this country are able to set at defi
ance the restraints of our interstate commerce
law, and to give to Canadian farmers better
rates to our own great markets than are en
joyed by a large proportion of the farmers of
New York. Thus, a law of Congress is made to
work to the injury of New York farmers. A
most aggressive and outrageous law of the
Canadian Government also empowers and in
cites the Canadian roads to such aggression.
This assault upon American interests is con
tained in Canadian statutory provisions, to
which the attention of the country has been
directed by the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion.
The result of all this stress of competition
and Canadian aggression upon New York agri
and had him shadowed from the day he
left prison. About a month ago Garrett
chartered a junk called the Peking at San
Diego and left there, and Riveroll's de
tectives set out after him, sending word to
Ensenada to Riveroll to be on the lookout.
Garrett's boat steered for Ensenada and
landed about six miles north of that point.
There he was met by a man named Hay
wards of Ensanada, who had a team and
two horses, and they started to drive by a
circuitous route to Ensenada, followed at
a distance by Riverol/s detectives and
some Government officers whom the latter
had notified in the meantime. Garrett
and Haywards finally made a stop and
unhitched the horses and mounted them,
leaving the wagon. The officers stayed
by the wagon, expecting the suspects to
return to it with their booty. They did
return, but empty banded.
The officers covered them with their
guns and then accused them of the theft
of the gold bar, threatening to shoot them
if they did not confess and lead them to
its biding place. Garrett and Haywards
knew well the customs of the country and
knew that the officers meant business, and
Garrett broke down and confessed to the
theft and offered to lead the officers to the
place where the bar was hidden. He took
them back to the town of Ensenada to a
point on the shore 600 feet from a wharf,
1800 feet from the Custom-house and in
plain view of the barracks and the entire
town, and there the long missing bar was
found a few feet below the surface, cov
ered with gunnysacks. None of the coin
taken from the bank was there, and the
presumption is if Garrett also committed
that robbery he either hid it elsewhere or
had spent it, the amount not being very
larue.
Garrett was taken before the Governor
same office in three minutes. He opened
half a dozen others in the presence of the
officers in from one to five minutes.
: As Garrett ; had ! already been tried and
acquitted of the \ crime he * could not, ac
cord to the laws of- Mexico, again be
held for it, and he was released by the au
thorities with reluctance and left immedi
ately for Los Angeles, where he now is.
The bar was handed V over to the mining
company and by them shipped to San
Diego, :: whence ft ,' was expressed to 'â  San
.Francisco, arriving yesterday. ;
The bar is a solid block of gold nearly

cultural and commercial interests was that,
when the "McKinley bill" was being prepared
by the Committee of Ways and Means of the
House of Representatives, solicitous and most
earnest appeals for protection of the agricul
tural interests of the State of New York came
up to Congress from Cbautauqua at the west,
and St. Lawrence at the north, to the extreme
limit of old Suffolk pointing seaward.
New York farmers asked for only such pro
tective duties upon their staple products as
would give them a chance to earn the narrow
margin of profits which is necessary in order
to keep any industry alive. The protection
sought was fully and generously granted, and
rt has inaugurated a new era in New York
farming.
The appeals for protection In the McKinley
act, to which I hava just referred, came alike
from Republican and from Democratic farm
ers through specially appointed orators and
also through Representatives in Congress of
both the two great political parties. And yet
it is a lamentable record of our political his
tory that the needed protection, so generously
and so justly granted, did not receive the
affirmative vote of a single Democratic mem
ber of Congress from the great State of New
York.
The farmers of the State have been greatly
benefited by the protection accorded them in
the McKinley act, and they would unitedly
and strenuously oppose its abolition, believ
ing that the repeal of the present duties would
be disastrous to them.
That was the status of protection as it
affected the New York farmer two years
aeo, but, in a similar wav varying in dif
ferent sections of the country. The ques
tion appeal* to the masses of agricultur
ists.
The closer one Btudies the question with
relatiou to the general welfare of the farm
er the more thoroughly is he convinced
that the American farmer is at a great dis
advantage without some such benign in
fluence as a protective tariff. Without
protection his products are each year more
and more at the mercy of the cheap prod
ucts of the world.
It has long been the opinion .of experts
that the American farmers' prosperity de
pends on the general welfare of the coun
try, and without protection the industries
which make farmers prosperous fail, and
general hard times ensue.
STILL ADVANCING
INTO THE VALLEY,
Another Section of the Peo
ple's Road to Be Opened
To-Day.
MORE REDUCED RATES.
Traffic Manager Moss Will Put
Them Into Effect at
Once.
CONSTRUCTION SOON TO CEASE.
One Hundred and Four Miles of the
Competing Railroad Now Ready
for Business.
Now that track-laying is finished on the
Valley road until the Fresno obstruction
ists become reasonable and permit the
road to enter that town without being
heavily penalized for the benefits it will
confer on all Fresnoites, it is the intention
to at once put into operation every avail
able mile of the completed road.
At the present time the stretch of eighty
two miles between Stockton and La Grand
is in full operation, and to-day it is pro
posed to add another length of twenty-two
miles to the operated portion of the
road. This will be the section between
La Grande and LanKershim, and will take
in the latter station and also Marguerite,
Sharon and Miller.
No further portion of the road will be
placed in operation until the present
trouble over damage claims made by resi
dents along the road's right of way in the
t \vn of Fresno is settled. Lankershim is
twenty-one miles from Fresno, but the in
tervening territory gives little promise of
traffic.
Traffic Manager John Moss has been
busy for the past few days preparing the
freight schedule for the section of road to
be newly opened and expects to issue the
new rates to-day. They will show the
same proportion of reductions in compari
son wjth the rates of the Southern Pacific
Company as the rates previously issued
by the Valley road.
With the increase of labor entailed by
the road being regularly opened for busi
ness, has come the necessity of relieving
Mr. Moss, and that gentleman yesterday
appointed as his assistant J. Shepherd
Jenks, who had learned the details of rail
road freight business under the adminis
tration of Mr. Moss while the latter was
with the Southern Pacific Company as
chief freight clerk. Mr. Jenks was with
the Southern Pacific Company for more
than ten years, and is familiar with Mr.
Moss's methods of doing business, fle
commenced his duties yesterday.
Construction work on the Valley road
will be suspended in about three weeks;
this will mean that about 600 men will be
thrown out of employment till building
operations are resumed. The 400 men
who were employed by the contractors
have already been laid off, and within the
next twenty days the 200 men in the ser
vice of the road will have completed the
work of putting in sidetracks and putting
tbe finishing touches on the tracks else
where. All but fifty of these will then be
discharged. The men retained will act as
section-hands.
Extensive construction work will not be
resumed until after the election.

TORRENTS OF TALK
ON THE FRANCHISE
Arguments on the Demur
rers to Fletcher's +â 
Petitions.
NO DECISION REACHED.
Supervisors Denounced as Being
Anxious to Betray the
City.
RAIIKOAD ATTORNEY PRESENT
The Discussion of the Injunction Will
Be Commenced on Tuesday
Morning.
W. T. Baggett, representing George R.
Fletcher; Leon Samuels, also representing
Mr. Fletcher; W. J. Brobeck, of the City
and County Attorney's office, representing
the Board of Supervisors of San Francisco,
and J. E. Foulds, a Southern Pacific at
torney representing no one in particular,
argued all day yesterday in Judge Dainger
field's court on the subject of the demur
rers to the writs and injunctions directed
to the Board of Supervisors in the matter
of the disposition of the Geary-street rail
road franchise.
All day long the untiring attorneys
talked, and when, late in the evening,
prodded to action by the increasing de
mands of a healthy appetite, Mr. Brobeck
announced that he did not care to argue
the matter further, the weary Judge heaved
a sigh of relief and asked when the lawyers
would continue.
With all tbe hours of maxillary music
only the argument as to the writs had been
completed. The injunction is yet to be
heard from. As the battle over it will be
as wordy as that over the writs, Judge
Daingerfield is in imminent danger of be
ing talked to death next Tuesday when
the torrent of words will again be un
loosed.
Yesterday's proceedings were enlivened
at times by good-natured tilts between
Mr. Baggett and Mr. Brobeck. Then
again, rencounters not so conspicuous took
place.
The morning session was consumed in
arguments on the subject 1 matter of the
complaints. The point raised that vhe
letter of the law had not been complied
with when tbe bids for the franchise were
advertised for was discussed.
The statute says that the bids must be
advertised for on ten consecutive days,
whereas in the present case two legal holi
days intervened. Then th 9 wording of
the resolution, which specified that 2 per
cent of the gross receipts of the company
securing the franchise must be annually
paid into the city treasury, was declared
to be a catch to shut out all bidders but
the Geary-street, Park and Ocean Railway
Company. The same was alleged of the
clause which provides that work on the
road for which the franchise is issue!
must be begun within a year and com
pleted within three years. The question
as to whether the Board of Supervisors
would act judicially or legislatively in
granting the franchise was. also disagreed
upon.
Mr. Baggett and Mr. Samuels in their
arguments claimed that the Supervisors
would act judiciously and also said that
the entire attempt to grant tbe franchise
was an attempt at stupendous fraud; an
atteniDt to sell for a few thousand dollars
a franchise worth a million. On the con
trary, Brobeck said that the Supervisors
should be commended for endeavoring to
secure a percentage of the gross receipts
of the company, which would aggregate
in twenty-five "years much more than a
miPion dollars. *
The question of Mr. Fletcher's interest
in the suit as a taxpayer was talked over
and resulted in a bit of repartee being
exchanged between Mr. Baggett, Mr.
Foulds and Mr. Brobeck. Baggett claimed
that Fletcher is an interested party and
that it is so alleged in the petitions.
Foulds disputed this statement, saying
that the allegation was contained in only
the petition for an injunction, which was
not then on argument.
Baggett admitted that Fletcher was in
terested only as a taxpayer in the price
realized for the franchise, whereupon
Foulds suggested that Baggett was trying
to mislead the court.
"Perhaps the court is not so easily mis
led as is the counsel," mildly suggested
Baggett. "At any rate, Mr. Brobeck has
admitted that Fletcher is a party inter
ested."
Foulds denied this, saying that if Mr.
Berbeck had done so, it was unintentional.
"I am surprised that Mr. Foulds thinks
it necessary to explain Mr. Brobeck's
action," said Mr. Baggett. "It seems to
me that there is remarkable harmony be
tween Mr. Foulds and the City's legai rep
resentative. May I proceed, Mr. Foulds?"
Mr. Baggett's argument filled the morn
ing session and overflowed into the after
noon proceedings. Immediately after
luncheon, refreshed and rejuvenated, he
began again. He started by referring to
the 2-per cent clause, and affirmed that it
was not contained in the original petition
of the railroad company, but had been
illegally inserted by the Supervisors with
out tbe assent of the petitioner.
"The conditions of the bid, as set forth
in the advertisement, amount to a viola
tion of the law," said he, "for the board
amended the application for the franchise
to the extent of the addition of a bid,
which the Suoreme Court has held ille
gal.
"How do we know,", continued the attor
ney, "that they do not want this franchise
for the purpose of shutting out competi
tion ?
"There is a street railroad in operation
along the proposed route, with a franchise
that has seven years to run. The Super
visors hays no right to grant another fran
chise so long as that one is in operation.
Common-sense would not allow us
to permit a stranger to come into
court and say that the owners of the old
franchise wish to abandon it. This whole
proceeding is shown, on its face, to be an
absurdity, for the conditions say that
work on the new road must be commenced
within one year. There could only be one
bidder under such a condition, ana it looks
very much to me as if the entire resolu
tion was framed so that such would be the
case.
"I do not see how a body of honest men
after their attention had been drawn to
this fact, could proceed as the Board of
Supervisors havedone.
'What must we say when they require
the Cny and County Attorney to come
here and say, 'It is true we have tried to
dispose of tliis franchise. Wo know that
we are robbing the public, but wbat are
you going to do about it?' They do not
deny anything. They simply say, 'There
is no law in the land to prevent de perpe?
tration of this villainy.' But there is.
There is a rerredy. There is always a
ren \i?u v where tner * is a wrong."
"What is your remedy," inquired Mr.
Broderick, smilingly.
"A writ of certiorari," replied Baggett.
He then went on to show, by quoting the
law and different authorities, that the Su
pervisors would be acting judicially in
granting the franchise, and hence be sub
ject to a writ of certioran.
Mr. Fletcher's right to sue was then
gone into, alter which subject was dis
posed of Mr. Bazgett subsided.
Mr. Brobeck then got the floor and be
gan his argument, by stating that he ap
peared not a3 an attorney for the rail
road, as Mr. Bazgett had intimated, but in
his official capacity as Assistant City and
County Attorney. He then areued against
the statements of Messrs. Baggett and
Samuels, but failed to produce any author
ities or law sustaining his position. His
only new statement of interest was that
personally he believsd that the street rail
roads should be compelled to pay 10 per
cent of their gross earnings into the City
treasury instead of 2 per cent.
Mr. Baggett closed the day's argument
by stating that the percentage bid is a
dishonest man's proposition anyhow,
that a dishonest man could bid a certain
percentage and a certain amount of money,
say $20,000. and so secure a franchise for
which an honest man, who intended to
Day what he bid, could not afford to com
pete. Having secured the privilege, the
dishonest man pays little or nothing.
Argument on the injunction proceeding
will begin on Tuesday next at 10 a. m.
SHE WANTS HER HUSBAND.
Mrs. Max Levin Rendered Insane by
Her Spouse* Desertion. !â¢
Mrs. Max Levin of 434 Jessie street was
before Judge Sanderson yesterday for ex
amination as to her sanity. She was ar
rested on complaint of Samuel and Dora
Adelsteinof 1017 Post street.
Mrs. Levin came to this City seven
months ago with her husband, who five
months ago deserted her. Her grief over
his absence is probably the cause of her
trouble. Some time ago Mrs. Levin re
ceived a letter from her brother who lives
in New York, informing her that he had
heard that her recreant husband was living
at 1017 Post street with another wonvan.
Since that time Mrs. Levin has made life
miserable for the Adelsteins. She has
watched the house constantly, hoping to
get a glimpse of her husband, and recently
secured a jearch warrant and went through
the Adelstein domicile from cellar to at
tic. Although she failed to find the ob
ject of her search her vigilance has not
relaxed.
Mrs. Levin seems rational on all subjects
except that of her husband's desertion,
and the court decided to hold the matter
in abeyance until tbe brother in New York
can be heard from. It is thought that
with proper care and attentidn her mind
can be saved.
Ashley Case Postponed.
Tho Ashley-Baldwin case was to have been
argued before Judge Slack yesterday, but on
account of tbe illness of U. Â£. Highton, lead
ing counsel for Baldwin, the argument was
postponed until September 15. Miss Ashley's
attorney, James L. Crittenden, opposed the
postponement, declaring it to be ouly a move
to farther harass and weary the plaintiff,
whose poverty and distress was such that she
could ill afford any further delay. However,
the postponement was granted.

After three hours and a half of delibera

of the People's party, the Democratic

afternoon it was decided to fuse on Presi

GaDriel Cohn, M. A. Hurley, \V. P. Lawlor.
The conference was held in the Demo
cratic headquarters in the California j
Hotel. M. F. Tarpey presided and there j
were present representing the Populists i
John S. Dore, E. M. Wardall, T. V. Cator,
James Asbury Johnson, A. B. Kinue and i
J. Mason. The only absentee of the Peo- !
pie's party committee was J. E. Camp of I
Sacramento.
The conference was called to order at 2
o'clock and did not end until 5 P. M., when !
an adjournment was taken until 3 p. m. ;
to-day, atwbica time, on motion of Jos- j
eph Asbury Johnson, the matter of fusion
on Congressmen will be taken np.
Most of the time of the conference was
used in attempts to persuade John S. Dore
that it was the proper thinz to allow the i
Democracy to swnllow the People's party. I
They had Mr. Dore against the wall in a j
corner for several hours talking at him. i
First a bimetallist drenched him withora- j
tory and sophistry.
The/i ex-Congressman Caminetti caught
him by the coat lapel, so that he could not
get away, repeated a speech that he had j
made on the floor of Congress respectine j
the virtues of the Democratic party, and I
setting forth what a glorious thing" what |
a glorious change it would be, to kick out
Grover Cleveland and the Democratic !
party and to kick in W. J. Bryan and j
Arthur Belaying-r>in Sewall of the First
National Bank, together with the same
old Democratic gang.
But Mr. Dore knew the wishes of his
neighbors. He knew that the Populists of
Central California would never vote
for Banker Sewall, and he knew that nine
tenths of the Democrats and silver Repub
licans in his district would not vote lor
hewalf.
He was unmoved by sophistry and fol
lowed the example of the sturdy Texans
at the Bt. Louis convention, who held aloft
the straight Populist banner and refused i
to assist the perfidious Democracy in per
petuatine for another four years British
rule in the United States.
Mr. Dore not only refused to sign the (
agreement, but will present a minority re
port to the People's party State, Central (
Committee, in which he will fully set forth '
the reasons which led him to withhold his
assent to the unholy alliance.
Mr. Dore came out of the conference
with a flushed fa/e. and was joined by his
friend Professor Douglass T. Fowler of
1- res no County. Professor Fowler is a
member of the People's party State Cen- I
tral Committee, and he, like Mr. Dore, is j
opposed to pledging the Populists of Cali- ,
lornia to give Arthur Sewall five votes for
Vice-president and Tom Watson only '
lour. c
"The Populists will not vote for Bryan t
and Sewall," said Mr. Dore to n Call re- s
;â¢ r'pr immediately after the conference c
j'fstcrday afternoon.
"I wanted Bryan and Watson electors r
ali through," he added. "That was the J
ticket we nominated at St. Louis, and that b
was the only ticket we wanted. I say with U
confidence that I represent the sentiments t
of the people of my section of the State in
the stand which I have taken. I can also
say from absolute knowledge that the
j great majority of the Democrats and the
I silver Republicans will refuse to vote for
Sewall for Yice-President. He is very un
; popular. Nine-tenths of the Democrats in
! tde San Joaquin Valley prefer Watson to
i Rewall and say that Sewall ought to be
| pulled down."
! "Ali that Mr. Dore has said," said Pro
fessor Fowler, "confirms what I know of
! the people of the San Joaquin Valley. I
| have recently heard from Shasta County
that the Populists and a large proportion
of the Democrats from that county will
not vote for Sewall. They prefer Wat
son."
Josepn Asbury Johnson explained his
vote by saying "If I vote for Bryan and
\v atson, I would be realJV giving McKin
ley half a vote."
Mr. Dore added that when he was at
tending the St. Louis convention he had
j the utmost confidence that Sewall would
be taken off the Democratic ticket. After
the nomination of Watson he received in
formation which made him more certain
than before that Sewall would be pulled
down and that Watson would be substi
tuied on the Democratic ticket. He after
ward ascertained that the Democracy, true
to its perfidious instincts, never had any
intention of replacing the Maine banker
with the lawyer from Georgia. He could
not conscientiously as a Populist vote for
a banker, a supporter of syndicate corpora
tions and the abettor of brutality to sailors
on the hiÂ«jh seas.
Mr. Dore will compel the People's party
State Committee to show their hand be
fore tne people of this State in the vote
upon his minority report. There is no
disputing the fact that Mr. Dore faithfully
represents the sentiment of the Populists
of this State, and that sentiment is that
they owe their whole and undividea sup
port to Thoma9 Watson for Vice-Presi
dent. As Mr. Dore tersely remarked: "If
we give up Watson, as this fusion would
make us do, we will have nothing left, and
we will be obliterated as a party."
When asked as to how lie would remedy
the evil caused by the fusion he paused
lor quite a while and said that the only
thing for straight Populists to do was to
put up a straight ticket, or vote for the
four Bryan and Watson electors and de
cline to vote for the five Bryan and Sewall
electors. By giving Sewall five votes
and Watson only four votes the Popu
lists would most certainly defeat Watson
and would elect either Sewall or Hobart.
Professor Fowler asked pointedly "How
many Knights of Labor, American Rail
way Union men, Federated Trades, Trades
Unions and wage-workers will vote for
Arthur Sewall?"
The question remained unanswered.

stole a canary bird and was sent to the
House of Correction by Judge Conlan.
When his term was up be drifted from
bad to worse, and finally was arrested for

him to life imprisonment.
A few weeks ago a woman named
Mamie Irving was taken tc :he Receiving

Thinking she was dying, she confessed
that it was she, and not Hutchinson, who
had robbed the sailor. The matter was

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, AUGUST 21, 1896.
SAYS MOWRY
IS A HIGHBINDER,
A Chinese Witness Startles
the United States District
Court
AT WILLIAMS' TRIAL.
Charges the Attorney With Be
ing a Member of the
Hop Sing Tong.
CHINESE TELL ABOUT BRIBES.
The Ex-Customs Inspector Got $ioo
for Landing a MongolianâCon
tempt of Court.
Ex-Customs Inspector Richard S. Wil
liams was again on trial in the United
States District Court yesterday on charges
of extorting money from Chinese and tak-
ing bribes to assist in the landing of Chi>
nese immigrants. At the morning session
there were many interested spectators
and later in the day the courtroom was
crowded, among those present being at
torneys, Government officials and a large
contingent of Chinese. "Dick" Williams'
family sat close to him all day, and hi;
pretty little daughter dressed in white
played about him.
The proceedings were enlivened by a
Chinese witness swearing solemnly thai
Lyman I. Mowry, one of the attorneys foi
the defense, was a member of the Hop
Sing Tongâ in fact, a highbinder. And ai
the close there was a digression when the
court sent a meddlesome Mongol to jail
for six months for contempt.
In the morning Dong Ting, a witness
for the prosecution, failed to answer; also
Chew Sing and Deputy Collector Tobin,
too, were not on hand when called, and at
tachments were issued for all three.
The indictment under the landing of
"Wong Ling Choy was next taken up. Choy
claimed to be a native of San Pedro Point,
Marin County. He landed September 17*
1895, after haying arrived on the Coptic
Au2ust3l.
Wong Sam was called to testify. He
spurned the services of an interpreter, and
then m good English told the counsel that
he was a broker and came to California in
1870. He admitted having had something
to do with the landing of Wong Ling Choy.
Said he:
"I first learned from his brother, Chin
Deck of San Pedro Point, that Choy was
on the Coptic. While he was on the steamer
I saw Williams. I asked him if it was
hard to land native-boms. He said: 'It
is very hard to land them now, because the
Collector is suspicious of all the native
borns.' I told him I wan instructed by
Chin Deck to employ an attorney to land
Wong Ling Choy, and Williams said : 'You
will have to go to court, and there will be
expense and trouble and bother. You dis
miss the attorney and leave the case to me.
it will cost something, but the attorney
oould not land him.' I asked Williams
how muca it would cost and he said, 'I'll
land him lor $100.'
"Then I asked Williams to come to my
room at 818 Washington street. He came
there and I offered him $90, but he refused
it, so I pave him $100. Chin Deck was
present when I gave the money.
"That evening Williams told me I should
have to get an affidavit of the boy's father
to square him with the Collecto?. A
gentleman on Montgomery street, between
Clay and Washington, made the affidavit
which was for the Collector. I kept it in
my room, but Williams never called for it,
and I couldn't find it the other day."
"Have you stated now all the conversa
tion with Dick Williams regarding Wong
Ling Choy?" asked Mowry.
"Probably not. The counsel don't ask
it," was Wong Sam's diplomatic answer.
The defendant's attorney tired the same
questions in different forms at the intelli
gent witness, who replied, "I think that
is all."
Sam told his history in the cross-ex
amination that was evidently intended to
trip him in some places. He came to San
Francisco in 1870 from China, spent six
months working in a lamily, after which
he went to school ana atudfed. Next he
went back to China, where he remained
for some time. On returning to Califor
nia Sam became a general merchant on
Dupont street, between Jackson and Wash
ington.
After two years he withdrew from the
business and went to Portland, Or., where
he was a merchant, thence to Nogales,
Hex., and from there to Phoenix, Ariz.,
whence he went tn Los Angeles to open
an intelligence office. He came to San
Francisco again and between 1889 and 1892
Collector Phelps offered to put him on tne
payroll, but Bam refused the money,
thougn he supplied the Collector with in
formation.
"How did you make your money then?"
asked Mowry.
"How did you make your money?" Sam
replied. i
"Answer my question," angrily de
manded Mowry.
"I made it to my store."
Mowry endeavored to show that Sam
had accumulated an an informer between
1889 and 1892 something like $10,000 and
returned with it to China; also that be
had to come back here from China as a
fugitive from justice.
The questions were ruled out, but Sam
indignantly denied them anyhow.
"You are a member of the Hop Sing
Tong Society?" the attorney asked.
"You have asked me that many times
before now," replied Sam. "I was a mem
ber fifteen years ago."
"You are a member now?"
"You are a member yourself," retorted
the witness.
"Do you mean to say that I am a mem
ber of the Hop Sing Tong?" asked Mowry,
with a show of anger.
"Yes, sir; 1 do."
"Now, don't you know that no white
man can be a member of a Chinese so
ciety?"
"i know you are attorney for the Hop
Sine- Tong, and you were a member."
"Do you swear that I was a member of
that society?"
"1 swear* you were. You gave $5 to it
fifteen years ago. You remember the
feast in a Chinese restaurant at that
time?"
"No; I don't remember."
Mr. Mowry was hot, and his reply was
petulant.
"Well, I remember." And Sam ap
peared greatly pleased.
"That was a highbinder society?" asked
the attorney.
"It is now, but not the first time when I
was a member."
Chin Deck, the reputed brother of Wong
Ling Cho}-, was identified in court, and
Bam was asked: "Is this the brother of
Wone Ling Choy?"
"That is what they told me," he replied,
"I don't know."
The defense endeavored to show that a
Wong could net be a brother of a Chin,
since they were of different families or
Interesting Characters in the Williams Trial.
tribes, and the witness Bdmitted it. Still,
this did not disturb Sam in the least, for
! he explained that Wong Line Choy was
ian adopted son. Sam's testimonj r was in
terrupted by adjournment for recess and
as Sam did not appear when court con
vened at 2 p. m. Judge Dibble was called
to testify for the Government.
Dibble stated that he had been em
ployed as attorney to legally land Wong
I Ling Choy, and was discharged by Wong
Sam a few days after the arrival of the
steamer.
Wong Sam. recalled, admitted that he
knew that a Chinese born in the United
States i 3 a citizen of the United States,
and as such is emitled to land on a writ of
habeas corpus. The object of this was to
sustain the contention of the defense that
inasmuch as Choy was an .American citi
zen there could be no wrongdoing on the
part of Williams in landing him.
Dong Ting was asked if Collector Wise
had not stated in his presence, "I will
| land this woman," meaning Ah Moy, and
Ting replied that one Chew Sing told him
about it. Dong Chee told him the foi
i lowing day that he would give $100 to
i Williams to have the woman landed.
Chin Deck, the brother of Choy, testified
that he visited Wong Sam in hi<> room re
garding the landing of Choy, about which
he had no direct dealings with Williams.
Shortly before his brother was landed the
witness had a conversation with Williams,
who advised him not to pay an attorney.
I For $100 Williams would land Deck's
brother. "The evening after landing,"
j continued the witness, "I met Williams
in Wong Sara's room and took $100 from
mv purse. He would not take $90 which I
was going to give, so I put the $100 in
Wong Sam's bands."
Deck swore that he had not testified be
fore the Federal Grand Jury regarding the
case, yet his name appears on the indict
ment.
"I was summoned," he added, "but I
had not time to attend."
"Didn't you send somebody else to tes
tify for you?"
"I sent a friend to testify, because I
couldn't speak English."
The witness corrected himself by ex
plaining that the friend did not appear
before the Grand Jury.
The jury was dismissed and the court
hoard the case of Dong Ting, charged with
contempt. Ting stated that his uncle,
Dong Sun, told him to make out bills and
to mind his own business and pay no at
tention to trifling raattera. This kept him
half an bour late in the morning. Dong
Bun reluctantly admitted taluing to his
nephew about the case and wa9 com
mitted to the County- Jail for six months.
The case will be resumed this morning.

WEARS A MEDAL
FOR HIS COURAGE,
Honor Conferred Upon Dis
trict Engineer John
Wills.
INTERESTING CEREMONY
Congratulatory Speeches Made
by the Fire Commis
sioners.
CHIEF SULLIVAN'S EULOGY.
The Recipient Makes a Modest and
Manly Speech and Is Visi
bly Affected.
The pleasing ceremony of presenting
John Wills, District Engineer, with the
"Scannell medal," for meritorious ser
vices, was performed at the meeting of
Fire Commissioners yesterday afternoon.
The room was filled with members of
the department. Chief Sullivan sat to the
left of the Commissioners, with District
Engineer Wills on his right, and Assistant
Chief Dougherty and thÂ« otl^er District
Engineers on his left. All the Commis
sioners were present except Commissioner
McDonald.
President Bohen, after calling the meet
ing to order, said he was pleased to see so
many present, ami he hoped all would
strive to be the next to win the honor of
the next gold medal.
Turning to District Engineer Wills, who
rose from his seat, the president said:
It is a very pleasing duty I am called upon
to-day to perform I assure you. When our
worthy and respected Chief Scannell died he
bequeathed the sum of $2000 to the keeping
of a Board of trustees consisting of the Mayor,
Auditor and Chief Engineer of this depart
ment to be invested in some safe Becurity, the
interest of the .same to bo used for the pur
chase of a medal to be known as the -'Scannell
Medal," to be presented to the member of the
department who in their judgment had per
formed some distinguished act of bn.very.
After a consultation of the officers of this de
partment it was the unanimous opinion that
you were entitled to receive the lirst honor,
which any member of this department would
be proud to have conferred upon him, and
which you have honestly earned by your
faithfulness to the duties entrusted to you.
You have beeu connected witn this depart
ment 1 might say from boyhood. I have
known you all these years and noticed you on
nil occasions. lam proud to say, with all sin
cerity, that I never saw you falter when duty
called you. You have performed many acu of
bravery worthy of any soldier on the battle
field, or fireman in the midst of a large confla
gration, which none but a brave man would
dare to do.
If 1 know you, which I think I do, this is the
proudest moment of your life. Take this
medal and wear it, ana may you never iive to
cast one blotch or blemish upon it, so that
when you take your departure from this vale
of tears your fellow-firemen will be able to say,
"Well done, thou good and faithiul servant."
The president handed the medal, a
sketch of which has already appeared in
The Call, to Assistant Secretary Spinetti,
who Dinned it upon Wills' breast amid ap
plause. The recipient, who seemed deeply
affected, said: "This is the happiest mo
ment of my life. I ara proud of the honor
of being the first one to receive this medal,
and I hope I will long have the health and
strength to perform my duties in the fu
ture as I have in the past." This modest
speech was greeted with applause.
Chief Sullivan said he was very much
pleased that the medal had been con
ferred upon Mr. Wills. He had known
him for twenty years in the department,
and he was one of the best firemen he had
ever seen in the business. On many occa
sions Mr. Wills bad done deeds that justly
entitled him to a medal. This was the
first opportunity they .had of awarding a
medal, and none was more deserving of
the honor. He was a safe and reliable
man wherever he was placed in a building;
he knew exactly what to do; he treated
his men like a gentleman, and relieved
him (the Chief) of a deal of anxiety.
"Toe presentation of this medal," con
tinued the Chief, "will stimulate the men,
although I am proud to say they do not
need to be stimulated. In the depart
ment there are as good and brave men as
ever went into a building â obedient, sober
and honest. Let me again say that I am
very much pleased to see Mr. Wills hon
ored in this way."
Commissioner Boyd said the ceremony
had come as a surprise to him, as he had
known nothing about it till he entered the
room. He had attended many gatherings,
but no other gathering had so pleasant an
effect upon him. It was as handsome a
medal as was ever manufactured, but aside
from that fact it had been conferred upon
Mr. Wills for bravery, which sbotiid make
it of tenfold more value than gold or jewels
of rare value.
"There is no fireman," continued the
Commissioner, "but is a hero unto him
self. There is no creat fire without individ
ual acts of heroism being performed that
are never known except to the fireman
himself, but the glory of having done his
duty Is sufficient for him. 1 only wish there
were medals enough for all those who by
their acts of heroism have richly deserved
them." The Commissioner's remarks were
greeted with applause.
Commissioners Edwards and Marshall
made a few congratulatory remarks to the
recipient, and the ceremony was con
cluded.
During the remarks of the speakers Dis
trict Engineer Wills was visibly affected,
and when the Chief was speaking the un
bidden tears came into his eyes.
The particular act of heroism that called
forth the awarding of the medal to Mr.
Wills was during the collapse of the
lodging-house on Fifth street and Mint
avenue about two months ago. Mr. Wills,
at the imminent peril of his life from fall
ing walls and crashing timbers, rushed
several times into the ruins and rescued a
number of those imprisoned under the
debris.

Another Pioneer Gone.
James Sprole, a â pioneer and a member of the
Exempt Fire Company, was found dead in his
room at the What Cheer House yesterday
morning. The deceased occupied a prominent
position in commercial circles some twenty
years ago, but since that time has been lead
ing a very quiet life. During the last few
years he has been hard pressed financially and
so far as known does not leave auy property.
HE CAUGHT A TARTAR.
Stirred Up More Trouble With
His Wife Than He Bar
gained For.
Because She Thinks Him Unfaithful
She Wants a Divorce and an
Accounting.
Alice O. Fritsch, a daughter of Louis
Schmidt, the musician who died on July
3, 1896. filed two interesting papers in the
County Clerk's office yesterday. One is a
complaint in divorce, praying that she be
granted a separation from her husband,
Emil Fritsch, because of his infidelity.
The other is a petition filed in the probate
department, charging that her husband
has misused the funds of the estate of
Louis Schmidt, of whose will Fritsch is
executor.
The trouble in the Fritsch family is evi
dently of recent origin. Just a month
ago the son-in-law of the musician was
given charge of his estate. At that time
his wife and her relatives were willing
that he should handle their money and
nothing seemed further from the thoughts
of Mrs. Fritsch than a divorce. The
change of heart came, however, when she
discovered that her husband had strayed
from the path of rectitude and forgotten
his marriage vows. The divorce proceed
ings were deemed a necessity. The alle
gations regarding the funds of the estate
followed incidentally.
The property left by Louis Schmidt is
appraised at about $15,000, nearly all of
which is money in bank.
Emil Fritsch is a stockbroker and is
serving as executor of the will, without
bonds, that being stipulated by his father
in-law. Mrs. Fritsch claims that her hus
band has no estate beyond his personal
property, which fluctuates with the stock
market. She says that his income de
pends entirely on the solvency and wil
lingness to pay of his customers,
and that at any time he is likely
to find himself bankrupt. Fur
ther than this, she claims that
the stockbroker has drawn from bank
$1600 of the funds of the estate, which be
has mingled with his own money and used
in his business. This $1600 is declared to
be in jeopardy, and if lost by Fritsch in
speculation, to toe irrecoverable by tno
estate.
Therefore it is prayed that Fritsch be
compelled to give an accounting of the
property of the estate and, having done so,
that he be removed and some one sub
stituted in his stead.

KILLED BY AN
ELECTRIC-CAR
Louis Locks, a Boy 7
Years of Age, the
Victim.
HIS SKULL CRUSHED IN.
He Ran Across Mission Street,
Near' Fifth, in Front of
the Car.
PLAYING WITH ANOTHER BOY.
Joseph W. Campbell, the Motorman,
Arrested for Manslaughter
abd Released.
Louis Locks, 7 years of age, son of Mor
ris Locks, foreman of the Columbia
Woolen Mills, and residing at 221 Sixth
street, was killed by an electric-car on
Mission street yesterday afternoon.
The car was No. 1174, the motorman be
ing Joseph W. Campbel'. It was one of
the yellow cars and was on its way from
Twenty-ninth and Mission streets to the
ferry via Kearny street and Broadway.
The car had just passed Mary street, be
tween Fifth and Sixth, about 4:40 o'clock,
and was opposite 913% Mission when the
boy ran across the street in front of it and
Lonis Locks, the Boy Who Was Killed by a Mission-Street Electric- Car, as He
Lay Dying in the Keceiving Hospital.
was knocked down. The motorman, hear
ing the boy's shriek, instantly stopped the
car.
B. L. Biess, manufacturer of counters
and tables at 907 Mission street, was
standing at the door of his store and, see
ing the boy run over, promptly rushed
toward the car. He dragged the boy by
the heels from underneath the car and
lifted him up in his arms. The right side
of the boy's head was crushed in and he
was gasping as if he were dying. Two
ladies who saw tne ghastly sight fainted
on the sidewalk, but quickly recovered by
the ready help of some ladies who ran to
their assistance.
Biess thought at first of taking the boy
to tbe drugstore on the corner of Fifth
and Mission streets, but when he saw the
full extent of his injuries he concluded
that nothing could save his life and asked
one of the bystanders to ring for the patrol
wagon. Tne boy was driven to the Receiv
ing Hospital and Drs. Thompson and
Stice and Steward Mogan did everything
they could for him, but he died in about
ten minutes and the body was taken to
the Morgue.
Campbell, the motorman, was arrested
by Policeman J. M. Morton and taken to
the Southern police station, where he was
booked on tbe charge of manslaughter
and released on his own recognizance by
order of Chief Crowley.
"I saw the boy," said Campbell, "cross
ing the street, and rang the bell several
times to warn him. I tried to stop the
car, but unfortunately was not in time to
save him."
Those who saw the accident were: B.
L. Biess. M. J. Murphy, 608 Howard
street, John Cassia and Grover Ruddick, a
boy living at 843 Mission street.
"I was standing at the door of ray
store," said Biess, "and saw the boy
Locks, who wore spectacles, and another
boy, evidently playing together. Locks
was on the south side of the street and the
other boy on the north side. I saw the
other boy run across the street behind the
car and Locks ran across in tbe opposite
direction in front of the car. Then I saw
tbe car knock him down and I ran for
ward.
"The motorman stopped the car very
quickly and I saw the boy underneath in
a doubled-up state, with his head down
and close to the rail. I dragged him out
by the feet, and saw that the right side of
his head was crushed in and his brains
were oozing out. I lifted him up in my
arms and was covered with blood. Then
he was taken to the hospital.
"I could not say whether or not the
motorman rang the bell. I was too ex
cited to think of anything but the boy's
danger."
Tbe boy Ruddick thought that some
one was chasing the boy Locks across the
street. He saw the car knock him down.
The motorman, he said, rang the bell sev
eral times before the car struck the boy.
The dead boy was near-sighted and
wore spectacles.
CARS TO PRECITA AVENUE.
They Cannot Be Ran '-to That Point at
Present. <- - .
General Manager Vining's office was in- j
vaded yesterday by a committee from the
Precita-avenue Improvement Club, who |
submitted a request that the Mission- j
street cars, which now stop at Twenty
sixth street, be extended to Precita ave
nue, two blocks farther along. :-.
Manager Vining stated that it was not j
possible to do anything in the matter at
the present time, as no improvement
work, except of absolute necessity, was
now being J: undertaken by 'â ' the Market
street Railway Company. He explained
that the steep depression between Twenty
sixth street and Precita avenue, which
comprised a down and up grade, made it
impracticable tto operate the cars, as the
power of tue i motor was * now being util
ized almost up to the full limit. It would
be necessary, he added, to till in this space,
and that the company was not prepared
to do at present. : â . : 'â _ â¢ ," â

FLUSHING OF SEWERS.
Superintendent of Streets Ash worth Re
plies to the Board of
Health.
The Board of Health sent a communica
tion to Superintendent of Streets Ash
worth yesterday requesting and demand
ing that he at once flush all ot the sewers,
cesspools and gutters under his jurisdic
tion, claiming that under existing sanitary
conditions such a measure is absolutely
necessary. During the day Mr. Ashvrorth
returned the following answer, which is
self-explanatory :
Edmond Oodchaux Esq., Secretary Board of
Healthâ Deab. Sir: I am In receipt oi your
communication regarding the flushing and
cleaning of the sewers and cesspools of this
City, and the same will receive my earnest
consideration.
In this respect I deem it but proper to state
that I fully concur with the Board of Health in
the importance and necessity of clean sewers,
and I have kept men continually employed at
this work. , _
Rather than let the sewage accumulate and
await the necessity of cleaning the entire sys
tem, I have pursued the policy of confining
the efforts of eleven gangs of men to clean the
cesspools and brick sewers and flushing the
pipe sewers in view of the sanitary necessity
which presented itself to my observation.
My operations in this behalf are directed to
districts requiring attention. The work is car
ried on without interruption, save ia instances
upon individual complaints filed in this office,
when immediate attention is demanded. I
have made use of chloride of lime in cesspools.
Respectfng tbe purchase of a portable tank
for flushing purposes, as suggested in your
communication, I will submit tne matter to
the Board of Supervisors. Very respectfully,
Thomas Ashworth,
Superintendent of Public Streets, Hignways
and squares.
QUARRELING PARTNERS.
Owners of Two Schoonen Fall Out
Over a Division of Profits.
John S.Jennings and Moses H. Jennings
have sued David B. Jennings and others
for the recovery of $450, alleged to have
been advanced because of debts incurred
in the shipping business in which the
parties to the suit are engaged.
David B. Jennings was the managing
owner of the schooners Plow boy and Trav
eler, but five other persons owned an equal
interest with him. It is alleged that David
8., while acting as manager, collected
large sums of money earned by the vessels
and appropriated it to his own use, neg
lecting to pay the debts incurred in run
ning the vessels. The plaintiffs say ttey
advanced $450 to keep the business going.
They therefore pray for an account
ing and for the removal of David B. Jen
nings as manager.
OCEAN VIEW COMPLAINS,
The Residents Are Loud in Their
Grievance Against Public
Neglect.
Lack of Sewerage Is the Great Draw
back of the Otherwise Pros
perous Section.
An open plain and ocean breeze have
saved the residents of Ocean View from a
plague. Were it not for those blessings
given by a bounteous Creator the inhabi
tants of ; this favored locality would be
subject to the worst form of malaria.
This is in consequence of an entire lack of
sewerage for the whole settlement. ; ,
All the refuse from the dwellings,
stables and outhouses is permitted to per
| colate through the soil, where it is ab-
I sorbed through the natural incline of the
land, finds its way into Lake Merced and
there mixes with the fresh water that is
supplied for domestic use to the people of
this City.
This indifference, however, is not the
fault of those who reside in Ocean View
proper, but a culpable carelessness on the
part of the City authorities and i some
wealthy property-owners who object to
paying" for the expense of constructing a
sewer and the City officials for not com
pelling them to do so.
The Spring Valley Water Company, which
is interested in preserving the purity, of its
water in Lake Merced, has offered to put a
sewer through the property owned . by tne
company for an assessment of $10 a lot on
the Ocean View property. This would
give an t opening into the Pacific Ocean,
and all that would be necessary for the
Ocean View people to do then would be to
connect their settlement by running a
sewer from the center portion a distance of
half a mile â < to connect with this. Then
they would have the same kind of outlet
for their water that the; Richmond people
now have. ; ;â  - 'â â  -â â ' '^/--. â ':.'â  ;â â .â .
Another grievance which torments : the
Ocean View people is the bad condition of
the streets. With the exception of Plym
outh " and Broad '. streets, that have been
macadamized, the othe"r streets are per
mitted to retain their virgin condition of
sand, leaving , them ' almost J impassable to
j anything heavier than a light spring
! wagon. â¢
As ' the r streets now j are the engine and
j hosecart lately stationed there cannot be
used on any of the streets except the two
j mentioned in case of fire. Consequently
j the station is practically, useless. ;~/; I,'1 ,'
i Through ;, the . persistent agitation ol
W. 0. Fisher, Frank Taylor, Lon i Brown,
Britten Bolesworth and a few other, pub
j lie-spirited residents i the old, v offensive
frog-pond has been filled up, and thus one
source of nuisance has been abated.
Ocean View, since the establishing of
the Ingleside s racetrack iin its immediate
.vicinity; ha'a â¢ become ; quite a favorite j re- 1

ple, many of whom would settle there be

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, AUGUST 21, 1896.
WILL FIGHT FOR
THE NEW CHARTER,
Plan of the Campaign of
the Citizens' Asso
ciation.
APPEAL TO ALL CLASSES
Disputed Sections of the Charter
Explained to Ail Who
Will Listen.
MONEY FOR THE CAMPAIGN.
The Merchants' Association Contrib
utes One Thousand Dollars to
the Fund.
The Citizens' Charter Association held
its regular weekly meeting at Kohler &
Chase's Hall, 23 O'Farrell street, last
night. It was an extremely enthusiastic
and harmonious gathering, the founda
tion for good work in the coming muni
cipal campaign being cemented in strong
bonds of unity.
The meeting opened with the rollcall
and reading of minutes, after which Presi
dent Phelan announced the following per
manent committees:
Credentials and additional membership â
James S. Conwell (chairman), C. Leidecker,
Harry Stockton, C. B. Hode, A. C. Boldemann.
Finance and auditingâ Colonel M. H. Hecht
(chairman), Wendell Easton, Colin M. Boyd, J.
J. O'Brien, M. A. Eothchild.
Press and publicationsâ F. W. Dohrmann
(chairman), W. R. Wheeler, Dr. G. Gutsch, L.
R. Ellert, Henry N. Ciement.
Meetings and speakersâ Herbert E. Law
(chairman), P. A. Bergerot, S. C. Hammond,
I. J. Truman, A. P. Van Duzer.
Law and legislationâ E. R. Taylor (chair
man), W. F. Gibson, Charles Wesley Reed,
Thomas I. Bergin, Curtis Hillyer.
Platforms of parties and electionsâ Hugo D.
Keil (chairman), Dr. T. A. Rottanzi, Irving M.
Scott, I. Schwartz, Isadore Gutte.
Probably the most important event of
the evening was the report of the commit
tee on press and publications submitted
by Chairman Dohrmann. Some few op
posed the methods outlined in the report,
but these objections finally over
come and the paper adopted by the asso
ciation. It reads as follows:
San Francisco, Cal., Aug. 20, 1896.
To the President and delegates of the Citizens'
Charter Association â Genilemen: The follow
ing report has been adopted by your commit
tee on press and publications, and is respect
fully submitted to your consideration and ;
approval:
Your committee fully realizes the vital im
portance of placing before the citizens and j
taxpayers of San Francisco copies of the pro
posed" new charter complete in its original |
form, as well as condensed in an accurate i
synopsis, giving all its essential provisions.
The first edition of 5000 copies of the synop- I
sis published by the Merchants' Association
has been exhausted. A second edition of 5000 ]
copies has been ordered by tne Merchants'
Association and is now ready for distribution.
This synopsis has been carefully prepared and
revised and is an exact and impartial epitome
of all the important provisions contained in
the original document A hall hour will suf
fice for the reading of this entire synopsis
Owing to the small amount appropriated for
the publication of the charter only 1000
copies of the complete document have been
issued. Nearly all of these copies have been
distributed. There are still a number of citi
zens who desire to have copies of the charter
as a wiiole. Your committee, therefore, rec
ommends that 1000 more copies be issued and
distributed by this association.
A fair comparison of the present consolida
tion act and the proposed new charter would
prove the most Interesting and instructive
compilation that could possibly be issued by
this association. Such a publication, properly
subdivided and arranged, would show at a
glance the marked difference between the
present government of San Francisco and the
new organfc law. An impartial comparison,
presented in this striking manner, will con
vert every intelligent and unprejudiced
person into an ardent advocate of the
new charter. Your committee, therefore,
recommends that :his association publish
70,000 copies of such a comparative treatise,
and that a copy be sent to each of the 70,000
registered voters of the City and County of San
Francisco.
The recent essay of our public-spirited presi
dent, James D. Pbelan, presents in a clear and
logical manner an irresistible argument in
favor of the new charter. A first edition of
2000 has been published by Mr. Phelan and a
second edition of 2000 is now in press. Your
committee ieels honored in recommending
that 6000 additional copies of this excellent
essay be issued an,d distributed by this asso
ciation.
Hou. Frank McCoppin, who was the first of
the ex-Mayors of San Francisco now living, has
contributed a masterly address upon the new
charter. It is a lucid exposition of the prin
ciples underlying municipal government and
will well repay the careful study of every citi
zen having the welfare of our City at heart.
This address has been published by Mr. Mc-
Coppin in pamphlet form, and your committee
takes great pleasure in recommending that
6000 copies be ordered by this association and
properly distributed.
There are a number of strong provisions in the
charter of special interest and value to all
bicyclists. The suggestion that a special ad
dress to bicyclists be prepared meets with the
cordial approval of your committee. Parties
most faniiifar with that phase of the subject
will be invited to prepare a special address to
cyclists and your committee recommends the
publication by this assoc.ation of 5000 copies.
There appears to be some apprehension and
much misunderstanding regarding the article
upon the public schools in the new charter.
We believe that a short treatise fully explain
ing the exact provisions of this article and all
its possible effects would entirely clear away
all doubts or fears upon this bead and remove
any opposition to tbe charter arising there
from. Your committee therefore earnestly re
commends that 2000 copies of such a publica
tion be immediately prepared and published
for distribution among- all teachers in tbe pub
lic schools of San Francisco.
The new charter expressly provides that the
members of the police force in service at the
time the charter goes into effect shall remain
as the police force under civil service rules,
guaranteeing to every policeman a secure and
permanent position during good behavior.
This excellent provision, as well as many
others in the new charter, should be made
known to every officer in the Police Depart
ment. Your committee, therefore, recom
mends the publication by this association of
1000 copies of a special address to tbe mem
bers of the police force of San Francisco.
Every active and exempt fireman of this City
should be a valiant advocate and defender of
the new charter, for it gives San Francisco
what it so much needsâ a fully paid and
equipped Fire Department. A special address
should be prepared setting forth this and
many other good features in the charter, of
interest to the Fire Department; and your
committee recommends that 1000 copies be
published by this association, and every fire
man in the city be presented with a copy.
The new charter involves not only better
principles of municipal government but is
also a practical question of dollars Â«md cents
to every taxpayer. The present lax method of
collecting and expending the public funds will
be supplanted by a rigid system of finance and
revenue. The new charter limits the annual
County tax levy to $1 07 on the $100 of taxa
ble property.
Under the new charter the taxpayers of San
Francisco would have saved $1,250,000 in the
past fiscal year. This is but one of the many
beneficial results of the new charter to the
taxpayer's of the City, and they should be
clearly stated In a special publication. There
are about 17,000 taxpapers on the assessment
roll of this City and County, and your com
mittee strongly recommends that 17,000
copies of such a special publication be issued
and a copy sent by this association to every
person on the assessment roll.
The proper means and necessary machinery
for inaugurating and maintaining great public
improvements are provided for in the new
charter. The bonding of the City for neces
sary public works will surely follow the adop
tion of the charter. These valuable public
improvements will be built and operated by the
thousands of able and deserving laborers in our
midst, and millions of dollars will be put into
active circulation to the direct benefit of the
City and all its inhabitants. This will help to
bring about an era of progress, and prosperity
will dawn upon this metropolis, and the con
tentment and happiness of our working people
will be the harbinger of better times for all.
Therefore your committee earnestly recom
mends the publication of a pamphlet upon the
new charter especially addressed to the worK
lngmen of the City, and that 10,000 copies be
distributed to all the labor unions and organiza
tions throughout San Francisco.
So much has been erroneously said and writ
ten regarding the alleged autocratic powers of
the Mayor under the new charter that a spe
cial publication should be issued upon this
head. A candid showing of tbe exact provi
sions and restrictions of the charter upon the
rights and powers oi the Mayor will readily
explode the many fallacies circulated upon
this topic and allay all reasonable opposition.
Your committee re'eommends that this associa
tion publish 5000 copies of such a document
to be advantageously distributed.
The total number of copies of all the twelve
publications enumerated in this report reaches
129,000. An approximate estimate of the cost
of printing, publishing, folding, addressing
and distributing these entire twelve publica
tions will amount to about $3000. A most care
iul examination of the large field to be cov
ered and the great work to be accomplished
prompts your committee earnestly and ur
gently to recommend this report for your con
sideration and approval.
In conclusion, your committee will take oc
casion to invite well-known citizens in all
walks of life to prepare special articles upon
the charter for publication and distribution by
this association. We would also request that
all matters intended for publication in the
press be sent to tha secretary of this association
and submitted to the consideration of your
committee. This wijl not only keep the asso
ciation advised of all the publications pre
sented by its de'egates, but also insure articles
oi merit the attention they may deserve.
Owing to the increasine work required of
the secretary, your committee recommends
that a stenographer be provided for the use of
all the committees of the association. Re
spectfully submitted. Committee on press and

The committee on meetings and speaK
ers submitted the following, which was
unanimously adopted:
It was unanimously decided by the commit
tee that a number of large mass-meetings be
held favoring the adoption of the charter by
the people; that these meetings be held in
large halls, with music and bonhres, and be
provided with good speakers. It was thought
desirable that they should be segregated, so as
tv appeal to the various elements in the City,
showing special advantages of the charier to
each; that the first of these large mass-meet
ings be devoted to the labor interests, under
the auspices of the Charter Association, in
Metropolitan Hall on Friday evening, Septem-
Der 4, the speakers to be especially selected.
An application from the pastor of the Third
Congregational Church, Fifteenth street, for
speakers to address tbe Young Men's League
on tne charter on Tuesday evening, August
25, was considered and the following speakers
were appointed: President Phelan, Secretary
Freud, Mr. Dohrmann and Mr. Bergerot.
We submit the following outline of this com
mittee's work: It is proposed, in addition to
the large mass-meetings, to hold special
meetings at the various headquarters of
different clubs, societies and labor
unions, among teachers and other classes (of
which there are, I believe, twenty-five or
thirty;, and at the large shops where working
men are extensively employed. To effect this
end we propose to issue invitations to promi
nent men in each organization, asking lor ex
pressions of indorsement of the charter, and
appointing in each organization a committee,
whose work it shall be to speak at their own
gatherings, and where advisable to call special
gatherings and have invited speakers dis
cuss the advantages of the charter.
Labor organizations are vitally interested in
the provisions of the charter, since it makes
possible extensive public improvements, in
creasing the demand for labor, beautifying the
City and developing its resources, thus bring
ing added traffic and industry. It lessens the
taxation, thus inviting investment of large
capital in manufacturing enterprises and
making possible extensive manufacturing,
with correspondingly good wages, such as rule
in other centers, where there is unrestricted
development, such as we should have under
the bonding provisions of the charter.
In the employment of the manufacturers
there are a large number of small property
holders. They have accumulated the prop
erty by the hardest of work and the closest
economy, and to-day the value of the property
is, in many instances, le-s thau when pur
chased. This cannot be otherwise as long as
taxation remains its present heavy burden,
and so long as the City is restricted in its
growth by the impossibility of profitable
manufacturing and extension. Thus, the
laborer is probably the most vitally interested
in tbe adoption of the new charter of any class
of people.
Tnere are many special interests; for ex
ample, bicyclists, who are vitally interested in
good roads. The enormous hills in the City
are in themselves sufficient hardship without
being obliged to ride on roads which are not
only uncomfortable, but absolutely dangerous.
There is no legitimate reason wny a city of
this size should not have good streets, except
the present government, which makes it im
possible to spend any money on development
without immediately taxing at a ratio wh'ch
would mean bankruptcy to half the property
owners of the City.
Cyclers have shown not only anxiety but a
willingness to work, aud work hard, lor good
streets. It is believed that if the cyclers be j
given a good opportunity to work on well- I
defined plains they will prove a power in ad
vancing the adoption of the charter.
Then there are the teachers â public em
ployes of all descriptions. They all have
interests and benefits in the charter, and
should be given an opportunity to express
themselves and work for it.
Special meetings lv the different precincts of
the City should be held. The taxpayers are
vitally interested in good government, mode- |
rate taxation, increase of valuation of their
property and in the development of the City.
They realize that every steamship line, every
lame manufacturing interest, every enterprise
that carries with it large expjnditures of
money and brings thriving trade and pros
perity to a city, can and will come only when
a city, by its development and management,
insures protection and success to these en- |
terprises. Tuere are hundreds of people I
who never come out to general meetings, and !
yet, they are largely property-owners, heads '
of families, who could be reached at the vari- I
ous precincts. Special meetings should be
held and addresses given at general meetings, i
Meetings ougnt 10 be heid at all the large
shops and stores where men are employed at a
time when large numbers are gathered to
gether. It is probable that difficulty might be
encountered in gnining permission to address
the men, either at noontime or some other
portion of the day selected, but it is believed
that if among each of the large centers of em
ployment good men are selected they can
bring sufficient influence to bear to secure the
permission, if not the co-operation, of their
employers.
There are a very large number of associa
tions, societies, clubs of various kinds â over
150, if I remember correctly. At our first
meeting we had, I think, over 300 representa
tives. All of these organizations have regular
meetings, and it is believed that if prominent
men from the different organizations be se
lected to represent the charter interests, make
speeches at their regular meetings, secure in
vitations for public speakers to address them
additionally, that a great deal of successful
work can be done.
Speakers generally find that small audiences
of a single class can be more successfully in
terested aud convinced than handling large
numbers of divided interests. To explain all
the provisions and advantages of the charter
is a very large undertakingâ almost an impos
sibility, in a night. There are many things in
it that have but a general interest for special
classes. Ihese points they will read at leisure
and satisfy themselves, but the critical points
to them, those things which appeal to them
directly, they want to know all about, and
they need somebody who will devote the even
ing specifically to tnelr interests.
There are also a number of organizations j
presided over by ladies, many of whom are
property-owners and control votes. They are
anxious and willing to work in a good cause.
They are vitally interested in the success of
the charter. Then there are also the church
organizations, one of which has already soli
cited an address to its members. They repre
sent large interests, are directly interested In a
[ management of integrity and success, and
most of them, if not all, if called upon and
| asked to work, will respond willingly.
Business men should be met and discuss the
question. Few really know how vilal the
question is to the interests of commerce and
business. Each line of business is deeply in
j fluencea by the conditions which now exist
and those which will arise if the new charter
be adopted. This class of men not only have
their homes, but they have their money in
vested in their business. It is a matter of the
greatest importance that this great, influential
and solid class of men are to be gathered at
the various bussness men's clubs. Special noon
day meetings are to be field at suitable places,
where the new charter will be discussed by
ab.e men of this class. In this way each line
of business will be interested and will see and
know the advantages to be gained by this
movement.
The above outline, gentlemen, Is submitted
for your consideration. In all public move
ments there is, as a ruie, a great deal of power
Biid labor never utilized. It is our purpose to
work so thoroughly that there shall be no will
ing worker in the ranks left without a work to
perform, and that we shall, with almost abso
lute certainty, come ia personal contact with
every class and organization and present to
them the charter as it only can be presented
by personal contact.

Considerable discussion followed the
reading of the report of the committee on
platforms of parties and elections. It was
finally adopted, however, in the following
form :
San Francisco, Cal., Aug. 20, 1896.
To the President and Delegates of the Citi
zens' Charter Associationâ Gentlemen : Your
committee upon platforms of parties and elec
tion begs leave to report as follows:
The scope of the work of the committee ap
pears to its members to be comprised in the
following six points:

"for the new charter" or '-against the new
charter" at the head of the municipal portion
of the electorarticket to be voted upon Novem
ber 3 of this year.
Secondâ To secure the insertion of a definite
plank in the platform of each political or mu
nicipal party favoring in express terms the
adoption of the new charter.
Thirdâ To secure a definite pledge from all
of the nominees to the next Legislature of
each political party stating that they will if
elected vote in favor of the approval of the
new charter by the Legislature of the State.
Fourthâ To secure the selection and appoint
ment by the Board of Election Commissioners
of honorable and efficient election officers and
a fair representation in each election precinct
of those who favor the adoption of the new

Fifth â To prevent any illegal registration of
voters and any fraudulent voting at the elec

Sixthâ To secure an accurate and honest
count of all the votes polled; and for this pur

the tallying of all votes poiled.
In furtherance of the work of our commit
tee, we hereby request the adoption by the
Citizens' Charter Association of the following
resolutions and recommendation^ to be sent to
the Board of Election Commissioners:
Whereas, A new charter for the City and
County of San Francisco will be vot^d upon at
the approaching election, November 3; and,
whereas, owing to the large number of officials
to be voted upon at that election, many votes
upon the charter will be omitted unless it is
placed at the head of the electoral ballot; and,
whereas, it is of the utmost importance that a

Resolved, By the delegates to the Citizens'
Charter Association in meeting assembled this
20th day of August, 1896, that we most earn
estly and respectfully petition your honorable
board to take sucli definite action as will re
move this question beyond any possible con
troversy.
Resolved, That your honorable board is
hereby respectfully requested to favor this as
sociation with an early assurance that this re
quest will be complied with.
Your committee would furthermore respect
fully recommend that each of the delegates to
this association be invited by the president to
recommend irom each of the organizations
reDresented by them at least five suitable citi
zens to act as "precinct officers at the approach
ing election on November 3. As soon as these
names are received at the office of the secre
tary of Â« lie association they shall be forwarded
immediately to the Board of Election Commis
sioners with the Indorsement of the Citizens'
Charter Association. As the selection of these
precinct officers is expected to begin next Mon
day, the 24th inst., your committee would
recommend that this matter be given im
mediate attention.
The foregoing report has had the careful
consideration of your committee, and is now
submitted with the hope that it will receive
the approval of this association. Respectfully
submitted.

The finance committee through Chair
man Hecht reported plenty of funds on
hand to meet all n<cessary expenses of
the campaign. The Merchants' Associa
tion at its regular meeting held yesterday
morning contributed $1000, to be used as
the Citizens' Charter Association deems
wisest. One of the most encouraging re
ports of the evening was that of the com
mittee on credentials and additional mem
bers. It read as follows:
Gentlemen: Your committee on credentials
and additional members beg to report that
they have examined the credentials of dele
gates from the following associations, viz.:
League of American Wheelmen, Bar As
sociation of San Francisco, Bay City
Wheelmen, Hungarian Mutual Aid Soci
ety, Golden Gate Cycling Club, Austrian Mil
itary and Benevolent Association, Ital
ian Benevolent Association, San Francisco
Schuetzen Vereiu, Hanoveraner Verein,
and that they have recommended the ad
mission to membership of the same.
On the question of membership your com
mittee finds that 135 organizations have heen
invited to send delegates; that of these 79 or
ganizations have Â£avoraDly responded. The
total number of delegates to the association is
now 186, representing 79 associations with
158 delegates. In addition to these there are
27 delegates, as follows : Board of freeholders,
9; ex-Mayors of San Fra icisco, 5; directors of
Merchants' Association, 13.
Your committee finds that there are a num
ber of organizations In tbe City not yet repre
sented on this floor. It will be our special
aim to make clear to those organizations the
many and manifest benefits arising from the
adoption of the new charter, and your com
mittee will pay particular attention to the
subject of interesting the labor organizations.
All of which is respectfully submitted.

ALAS, THE FAIR WILL DRAMA
It Loses Its Most Attractive Figure
in the Departure of the
Young Actress.
Mi6s Margaret Craven, who has been
such an interesting figure â the most inter
esting figure in the great drama of the
Fair will for so many weeks â has put on
the robes of a new role, and the drama of
the Fair will will dragon through the in
terminable acts yet to be played without
her brightly cheering presence.
The young lady left last Saturday even
ing for New York to fulfill an engagement
recently entered into with A. M. Palmer,
under which she is to play as leading lady
in the "Absent Boy" company.
The "Absent Boy" is a new play, to be
brought out in fine style by Mr. Palmer
next season. Henry E. Dixey has the star
male part, ''Mr. Pennie," and promises
his friends that it will be one of the "parts"
of his life.
To the theater-goers of San Francisco
nothing need be said of Miss Craven's
histrionic talent. She has appeared here
repeatedly in characterizations calling for
an infinite display of versatility, every de
mand of which she has met. As the Prin
cess Vera in "Moths," with the Frawley
company at the Columbia, she was nightly
greeted with rounds of applause. She
played also with Rose Coghlan in "A
Woman of No Importance," as leading
lady in "A Lottery of Love" and as
Hatty in "Uncle John."
Nor is this her first appearance in the
metropolis. She played there several
ssasons at the Empire Theater, with the
stock company of which she afterward
made a tour of the country. With a face
that might alone be a fortune on the stage,
Miss Craven has also form, voice, expres
sion ana address that rarely equip her
for success in her chosen profession and
that insure her a bright future. Since
her first step before the footlights Miss
Craven has been a success, constantly
growing. The engagement with Mr.
Palmer is a distinct recognition of this
fact.
During the months she has been in this
City Miss Craven has received numerous
offers of engagements for next season, but
has been slow to listen to them because of
the illness of her mother and the impor
tance of the affairs in which she (Mrs.
Craven) was interested. The mother, too,
was equally loth to let her go. However,
Mr. Palmer succeeded in persuading both of
them, and last night saw the young lady
away toward the East with a shower of
good wishes from many friends for new
and greater success in the new play.
A DISTINGUISHED HONOR.
San Franciscans Invited to Fay a Visit
to Moscow Cottage.
Out on a bluff overlooking the Russian
River, just this side of Duncans Mills, is
the beautiful country residence of Hon
Morris JSewton and family, known as
Moscow Cottage. When Mr. Newton
learned that Excursion Manager Locke
would have a special excursion over the
North Pacific Railroad to Cazadero next
Sunday he sent a cordial invitation to the
excursionists to stop at Moscow Cottage
and enjoy a view of the river. The invita
tion is such a compliment to the .people
who comprise Mr. Locke's excursion par
ties that arrangements will be made to ac
cept, and a slight change will be made in
tbe schedule accordingly. Sale of re
served seat tickets has begun and will con
tinue daily until 9 p. m. At the 8 a. m.
Sausahto ferry next Sunday morning
there will be tickets guaranteeing seats for
all who desire to join the party. The
popular round-trip rate of $1 50 will
prevail.

CASH IN THE TREASURY
Municipal Employes Will Have to Walt
for Their Money Daring the Greater
Part of Next Month.
The monthly counting of the cash in the
city treasury was accomplished yesterday
by Auditor Broderick, Judee Trout of tha
Superior Court and Colonel Taylor Rogers,
representing the Mayor, the result being
that tbe Treasurer and his employes put
up 90 cents, representing the shortage in
the municipal funds for the period men
tioned.
Some clerical errors in the balance
sheets of the office caused tho difference
in the amount shown by the books and
the actual count and the employes put up
the coin rather than have any dispute
about the matter.
Tne result of the count shows that the
payment of some of the August bills of
the City government may have to be de
ferred. The July accounts -will all be paid
as a consequence of the surplus left over
from last year, out lor the succeeding
month there is quite likely to be a sdort
age and a consequent heavy registering of
warrants.
As a matter of fact there will not be suf
ficient money on hand after September
1 to meet demands until September 21,
when the Board of Supervisors meets to
determine the municipal appropriations,
and many office-holders will have to wait
until funds are available.
In October more registering will be necÂ«
essary and the City government will not
be in clear water until the latter part of
October, when the bulk of the taxes on
real estate will be available.
Treasurer vVidber considers that the
City is in far better shape than it was last
year at this time and that the employes
of the City government will not have much
trouble in obtaining their pay.
CAMPBELL WAS IN TOWN,
The Honolulu Millionaire Paid
a Visit to Detective
Lees.
Winthrop's Trial to Come Up Monday
and a Strange Counter Story
Promised.
The trial of Oliver Winthrop will, in all
probability, begin on Monday next. Yes
terday the accused was in Judge Wallace's
court ia order that he might be allowed
the statutory continuance denied him the
other day. This move was decided on by
the prosecution in order that there might
be no chance for a reversal by the Supreme
Court. District Attorney Barnes is. how
ever; very desirous of bringing the case 'to
immediate trial.
James A. Campbell, the prosecuting
witness, was not in court yesterday, al
though notified by Captain Lees that his
presence was desired. It is said, however,
that the Hawaiian millioniare will be on
hand on Monday.
Attorney Frank Bell asked that A. A.
Brown, one of the talesmen ort the present
panel be excused, as he intended to use
him as a witness. Judge Wallace ex
cused him.
Private Detective Hicks, who is collect
ing evidence by which Winthrop hopes to
establish an alibi, expresses the opinion
that Campbell will not appear to testify at
the trial. He asserts that testimony will
be given in court at the proper time that
will completely shatter the story told by
the aged millionaire.
Millionaire Campbell and wife were in
tne City yesterday, but returned by an
early evening train to San Jose, where
they have bren staying for the last week
with their two little daughters and near
their two older daughters, who are in the
College of Notre Dame. A consultation
was hela wi-fch Detective Lees, who, firmly
convinced of the truth of the old man's
story, is making every effort to produce
convincing evidence against, Winthrop.
Campbell came up from San Jose en a
forenoon train and arrived about 11 o'clock
at the Occidental Hotel, where he and
Mrs. Campbell bad luncheon.
The plan of the defense is to depreciate
the old man's damaging atory and to cast
discredit upon it generally. How that
might be accomplished was shown from
time to time in the papers before Win
throp was captured and preparations be
gun for hid defense.

SOME CAUSTIC COMMENTS.
Claim That the On'.y First Congre
gational Society Meets in Golden
Gate Hill.
Deacon Morse iÂ» not the man to play a
losing game. Yesterday morning the
"opposition" was ready to march up to
the First Congregational Church building
and take possession. In the evening they
were completely at sea.
"The idea," observed the senior deacon
last night, "that three members could
compel the truEtees to open the church is
simply amusing. No such rule is to be
found in any manual of Congregational
law that I ever saw, and I have seen many.
The church will not be opened to serve as
a theater of scandal and contention."
The trustees held a meeting yesterday
afternoon, W. F. Whittier, James Cole
man, W. J. Dutton and Charles Merrill,
ail the trustees at present in town, being
in attendance. Trustee Dodge is now in
Europe, and there are two vacancies in the
board, which should regularly consist of
6even members. The demand of the op
position for the reopening of the church
on next Wednesday evening was read and
unauimously refused.
The reasons given for the refusal were,
first, that no guarantee was given that the
expenses attendant upon the reopening
â¢would be met, and second, that under 1
existing circumstances and in view of the
fact that the Bay Conference is about to
rake up the former trouble at its coming
session, such reopening would be unwise
and inexpedient. This determination was
declared to be final, and a resolution to
that effect was adopted.
The financial status of the society called
forth much discussion. There is at pres
ent an indebtedness of about $6500 hang
ing over the church, and since there is no
income from any source, demands have
become somewnat pressing. Several
plans for raising money were suggested,
mid the trustees at length decided to ap
ply to the courts for permission to niort- !
gage the property. No notice was taken
of the present conflict between the two
factions :n the congregation, the meeting
being purely business like in character.
"Things are in a queer tanele," com
mented one of the cnurch officers when
informed of what had transpired at the
meetine. "As I underhand the situation, j
about six weeks atro the deacons decided I
to invite the Rev. Dr. Adams of St. Louis
to come and survey the ground, as it were,
with a view to restoring harmony in the
\ church. Deacon Morse was asked to com
municate wi:h Dr. Adams, and in due
time received an encouraging reply. Then
this opposition, as they call i:, started in
mixing things up.
"The church people have been meeting
in Golden Gate Hal), where they nave an
average attendance of about 400. There
aie about as many more members who are
holding aloof waiting for things to settle
down. The opposition consists of about
forty persons, but they make up in venom
what they lack in numbers. The First
Congregational Society is the one which
meets at the hall on Sutter street and
there is no other organization entitled to I
tiie name. Four of the deacons, thecflurch
clerk, the standing committee and the
trustees are part and parcel of the Sutter
street congregation, which will reoccupy
its church building when the other people I
snail have done with their tantrum-. '
A pillar of the opposition stated that the j
subscription list mentioned in The Call j
of yesterday would commence ita rounds
to-day, seven copies :o be furnished to as
many persons, wfio will make a thorough
canvass for signatures. A movement is
on foot to bring about the resignation of
deacons, church clerk and stand ng com
mittee, after wnich new officers wil! be
elected to fill the positions of those now
considered objectionable. This project is
directed against Deacon Morse in particu
lar, since he has been mainly instrumen
tal in keeping the congregation from dis
banding by convoking them in the Sutter
6treet hall.
"I am satisfied with the action of the
tru-tees in keeping the church closed,"
said the senior deacon, when told of the
result of the meeting, "it would never do
to open it wnile Dr. Brown's enemies are
carrying on in their present fashion. It
â¢would keep the churcn in hot water alt
the time. There is no truth in the state
ment that Dr. Brown intends returning
hither.
"He is at present acting under contract
as supply for the Rev. Dr. Blanchard, |
pastor of the Church of the Covenant, the
principal Congregational church in
Chicago, where he is meeting with the
most gratifying success. As soon us he
can leave Chicago .^e will, proceed to
Dubuque in order to be formally received
iuto that conference, which is most
friendly to him,, and has offered to admit
him into fellowship with its members. In
case the Bay Conference takes any future
action he will be represented at its ses
sions by a duly accredited attorney."

City and County Attorney Creswell
âº gave notice that at the next meeting of
the board he would move that two Popu
lists be appointed as election officers in
addition to the five Democrats and rive
Republicans.
"Under the law," he said, "we must
appoint twelve officers, and in appointing
them we must give the parties polling the
highest vote at the last election the ma
iority, and mast also give representation
to the party thai polled more than 5 per
cent of the total vote. lam in favor of
giving the Democrats five, the Republi
cans live and the Populists two. I ani
also in favor of making one of the Popu
lists a judge ana the other an- inspector,
because these are the important offices.
Each party will then have one inspector
and one judge."
"Hold on," said Mr. Smiley, "there is go
ing to be or has been a fusion between the
Democrats and Populists. The result of
this action will be that the Democrats will
virtually have seven of the officers on
each board while we have only five. That
would not be a fair apportionment. It
would be unfair to the Republican party."
i Th .? PoDulisl 3 won't fuse," said Cres
wcll. "so there is no occasion for alarm."
"They have already done so," said
Smiley; but the further discussion and
settlement of the matter was postponed
until next Monday.
SUES THE COMPANY.
Irwin Silverstein Claims Damages for
Injuries Caused by a
Laborer.
Irwin Silverstein, by his brother and
guardian, Jesse G. Silverstein, began a suit
yesterday in the Justice Courts against the
Market-street Railroad Company for $299
damages.
Young Silverstein alleges in his com
plaint that on April 10 last he was riding
his bicycle along Leavenworth street near
Golden Gate avenue, when one of the em
ployes of the corporation who was engagtd
in excavating between the rails of the de
fendant at that point struck his wheel
with a shovel, throwing him into the ex
cavation. His bicycle was damaged, his
clothing torn and his person injured to
the extent demanded in the complaint.
A HIGH-NOON WEDDING,
Nuptials of Garret McEneroey
and Miss Elizabeth
Hogan.
Reception After the CeremonyâFeli
citous Speeches at the Briial
Breakfast.
Garret McEnerney, the distinguished
and popular attorney, and Miss Elizabeth
Hogan, daughter of the late J. S. Hogan.
a Napa pioneer, were married yesterday
at noon at St. JUary's Cathedral on Van
Ness avenue.
Archbishop Riordan, assisted by Father
Kirby and Father Mulligan, read the
solemn words that made the distinguished
couple man and wile.
The church was crowded to the doors
with the many friends of the popular
young couple. The decorations of the
church were elegant and artistic. The
altar of St. Marys lends itself readily to
decoration and ablaze as it was with
countless tapers and almost hid 'neath a
wealth of fragrant white blossoms it pre
sented a most artistic and beautiful pic
ture.
To the strains from the bridal chorus of
'"Lohengrin" promptly at noon the bri
dal party entered the church, passing
from the Vestry to the altar. Thomas E.
Flynn, editor of the "Wasp, officiated a?
best man, and Miss Mary E\i<i Ttiomas as
maid. After thÂ» ceremony the friends ot
the lianpy couple crowded around them
to offer many wishes for their future pros
perity and happiness.
A reception at the future home of the
young pc pie. 415 Shrader street, was at
tended by some sixty friends. Here an
elaborate bridal breakfast was served.
The guests were seated at small round
tables that had been distributed through
out the handsomely decorated room.
At the bride's table were seated Mr. and
Mrs. McEnerney, Archbishop Riordan,
latner Mulligan, Mr. and Mrs. J. Downey
Harvey, Mr. and Mrs. W. D. English,
Charles Flynn and Miss May Thomas.
While the good things were being passed
around ana the champagne flowed toasts
v.ere in order. To Thomaa Flynn, the best
man. fell the happy opportunity of re
sponding to the Archbishop's toast, "The
Health of the Bride and Groom." Mr.
Flynn acquitted himself in' a most delignt
ftil manner. His remarks were wonder
fully witty anci appropriate and succeeded
in putting all in the best of humor.
Among the others who spoke were J.
Downey Harvey, Henry Hogan, If. N.
Bradley, Father Slattery, W. C. Morrow,
J. H. O'Brien, J. C. Nealon, J. J. Barrett,
John Dunn, Mr. Murray, Father Gleason
and Judge Lawlor.

Mr. and Mrs. McEnerney left fora two
weeks' southern trip.
No cards were issued for the wedding,
which was characterized by a most de-
Jightful informality, but on their return

N0 MORE FREE CAKES.
Master- Bakers Have Stopped the Prac
tice of Giving Presents.
"No more presents of cakes and confec-
tions at Christmas or other holidays" was
the decision of the Master- Bakers' Pro
tective Association, which met yesterday.
The association was formed for the pur
pose of protecting the trade from the in
roads made by a number of bakers who
bid for business by underselling the
others.
The membership is now eighty-five and
the purpose is to regulate business on a
basis to the best interests of the majority.
The first move wbs to shut off on tne
free pies and cakes that hurt the profits.
All the members signed the compact and
adopted a resolution to fine all those who
violated the agreement $50 for each of
fense. In order to conduct the bakery
trade in accordance with businesslike
methods it was decided to call a meeting
of flour merchants and commission men
and establish a rule that no credit shall
extend over thirty days.

in the hospital grounds is suspected.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, AUGUST 21, 1896.

Louis Greenberg, a Cente
narian, Hale and
Hearty.
BANISHED FROM POLAND
He Was in France During the
Last Days of the First
Empire.
MADE AND LOST TWO FORTUNES
His Shroud and Coffin Are Ready for
Occupancy in Case of
Accident.
Yesterday Louis Greenberg, an inmate
of the Hebrew Old People's Home in this
City, was a century old, and the ancient
gentleman celebrated his ripe years in a
LOUIS GREENBERG, THE MAN WUO SAW NAPOLEON I.
fitting manner. Many prominent business
men remembered the old man and his age,
and sent him gifts and congratulations.
He was born in Seidlitz, Poland, when
troubles were falling thick and fast upon
that unhappy, dismembered country. He
early too* an actire part in the political
dissensions of the time, and went into ex
ile at 15. The Poles learned to be patri
otic in their cradles and suffered for it in
their youth.
He went to France, the refuge of the
banished, and for many years was a com
mission merchant in Paris. During the
close of the Napoleonic era he lived in the
capital city and many times saw the great
Corsican and heard the imperial bugles
sounding through the streets. Old Mr.
Greenberg remembers and loves to speak
of the Emperor and is sad when he recalls
the downfall or Bonaparte, the warrior
friend of Poland.
He afterward removed to Algiers, where
be met and married his wife. She died in
1854, leaving him two children, who died
in their youth. Soon after their death he
removed to America and embarked in ac
tive business. He soon acquired consider
able money, but lost it in an unlucky
speculation.
He came to this State in 1863, wherp,
from \ penniless stranger, he soon grew to
be a man of means and finally of wealth,
when the great mining deal and disaster
of J876 swept down UDon the street, and
Louis Greenberg, with many others, was
ruined and his fortune scattered. He
struggled against misfortune, but never
succeeded in establishing himself firm in
business again, and about ten years ago
he became an inmate of the Hebrew Home.
Although 100 years, with their ups and
downs, their fortunes and misfortunes,
have gone over his head, his mind is clear
and he remembers the most minute de
tails of his active life. The flight from
Poland, the great Napoleon, life in Africa
and in America, are yet fresh in his mem
ory.
In 1849 he had his coffin and shroud
made for his final occupancy and kept
them near him, so as to be bandy, he said.
When he went to the home the officers ob
jected to the coffin and it was banished
from the institution. The shroud he was
permitted to retain and the sepulchral
garment hangs in his closet. However,
he wants it understood that he does not
intend to use either the shroud or coffin
for a half of another century, unless he
should meet with an,accident.
Mr. Greenberg enjoys excellent health
andean read and write without glasses.
He takes care of his person and is cleanly
and genteel in his habits. He is a light
eater and seldom partakes of liquor or uses
tobacco. Wfth a fine, sound constitution
and a quiet, peaceful disposition, it is
believed he will lengthen out hi 3 span of
years far over the century mark.

Basil Heathcote . Seeking a Divorce
';' , From His Wife.
; Proceedings which will probably end In
a divorce being granted Basil Heathcote
have been begun. For more than a year
past the Heathcotes, , who are ; well known
in local > society circles, have lived apart,
the husband 5 residing ;in San : Rafael and '
the j wife ; in [ New York. It was though
that the couple had agreed to disagree,jand
that no divorce would be asked for, but
the trace has ', been broken aud a separa
tion asked on the ground of desertion. H â 
; Mrs.^Heathcote was a Misn Kittle and
was married in June, 1887. Her husband,
who is of a prominent family of Wiltshire,
England, came to' California about a year i
before that time as the representative of
several English capitalists. He was an ar
dent sportsman, as was his wife, and tDey
became attached because of their similar
ity of tastes. The marriage was a very
quiet one, owing to the death shortly be
fore of the bride's father.
Mr. Heathcote was lor some time en
gaged in the wholesale liquor business in
this City with Harry Dexter, but of late
has been busied in no commercial pursuit.
WANTED HIS MONEY.
Why Dr. F. F. Lord Was Sued in
the Justice Courts by a
Fair Client.
Dr. F. F. Lord's suit against Mrs. Lottie
White developed some interesting points
in Justice Groezinger's court yesterday.
Dr. Lord is a dentist and Mrs. White was
formerly a patient of his under the name
of Mrs. Dennis. As she was about to be
married she desired to present as pleasant
a personal appearance as possible. Mrs.
Dennis applied to the dentist and re
quested him to remove a rubber plug from
her teeth and replace it with one of gold.
The charge for the change was $30, and
Dr. Lord, after doing as requested, refused
to allow the lady to leave his rooms until
he had received his money. As his coin
was not forthcoming, he insisted on his
patient going back iuto the dentist's chair
and having the plug removed. Mrs. Den
nis then went to another dentist to have
the work done and Dr. Lord sued for his
fee. The matter was taken under advise
ment, the judge desiring some expert tes
timony as to the value of tooth plugs.
HOP-PICKERS WANTED.
Large Orders From the Country Have
Been Keceived.
The hop-picking season has again rolled
around, and opportunities will soon be
presented for hundreds of people to visit
the country on vacations that will be alike
pleasant and profitable. At all of the
large hopyards in the State there is plenty
of work to be done for six weeks or two
montns, and those who have left the City
in past years have enjoyed the novelty of
camp life and outdoor work.
Last year the free employment office
attached* to the State Labor Bureau sent
hundreds of people to the bopyards, and
the experiment proved a success for those
who worked and those who employed.
While the wages were not large the pleas
ures of camp life more than made up the
compensation for those who otherwise
would have been unable to leave the City.
Whole families packed their blankets and
tents and went to the country, and nearly
all were sorry when the harvest season
was over.
This year the exodus of hop-pickers
from the City promises to be iarger than
ever. The first order for tÃis kind of labor
was received at the State's Free Employ
ment Bureau yesterday. J. B. Durst, a
large land-owner at Wheatland, Yuba
County, sent in an order for 500 pickers,
and Labor Commissioner Fitzgerald will
undertake to till the order at once. Tne
wages offered this year are better tban
last, 70 to 90 cents per 100 pounds being
the price. Men, women and children will
be accepted and sent to Wheatland as soon
as the hops are ready ior picKing, which
will be very soon.

GOLD GOING FROM
THE SUB-TREASURY.
Four Millions Withdrawn
During the Present
Month.
TALKS WITH BANKERS.
Most of the Gold Held in the
Vaults of Banks in
This City.
STOCK OF MONEY INCREASE! 1 .
Financial Situation in This City Com*
monly Regarded to Be
Very Strong.
Cashier Burns at the United States sub
treasury, in this City, made the state
ment yesterday to a reporter of The Call
that duing tne present month of August
there has been withdrawn $4,000,000 in
gold from the sub-treasury in exchange
for greenbacks and other currency.
Mr. Burns made no attempt to explain
this striking fact. The withdrawal of this
large amount has left about $5,500,000 in
gold in the sub-treasury. This large with
drawal is entirely unprecedented, but, ac
cording to bankers who were interviewed
last evening, a very small proportion of
tne gold has found its way out of the State.
One of the best known bankers in the City
estimated that not over $500,000 of this
gold has gone East. The remainder is in
the vaults of California banking institu
tions.
Inquiry was made in many quarters last
evening to ascertain the reasons for the
withdrawal of the gold from the sub
treasury. The answers which were re
ceived from conservative and well-in
formed men all tended to show one fact of
significance, which is that the local money
situation has been very greatly strength
ened during the period of the transferring
of the goid from the sub-treasury to the
banK vaults, because at least $1,000,000 has
been added to the money in the City and
probably a very much greater sum than
that.
The $1,000,000 represents the sale of
Government bonds in New York by Cali
fornia parties, and the transference of
the proceeds to this City. The money re
ceived for the bonds was presented at the
sub- treasury and was there converted
into gold, which has gone into bank
Vaults.
A banker who knew about the transac
tions involving the sale of Government
bonds by California parties in New York
placed the estimate of the total transac
tions at the hgure of $1,000,000, as quoted
above, with the understanding that this
was only an estimate.
This gentleman also instanced another
fact which may account for large gold
withdrawals or rather transfers to local
bank; vaults, and this fact also shows that
the local situation has been made even
better than it was before. "Parties having
deposits in Eastern banks may have called
for their Eastern deposits. They have re
ceived their money from the out in cur
rency and have turned it into gold. Or
course you can see that the bringing of
currency here in payment for Govern
ment bonds and also the bringing of East
ern deposits here in currency has added
large amounts to the amount of money
actually here. I have very good means of
knowing, and I feel confident that net
over $500,000 of gold has gone East. I
also feel confident that the exchange be
tween San Francisco and New York does
not account for the drawing out of gold
from the sub- treasury."
The same gentleman also said: "I am
aware and others are aware that some
weeks ago there was a very large importa
tion of silver certificates into this State.
The attention of bankers was called to the
fact by the unnatural and unusual way in
which they came to banks. They were re
fused at some banks, but for a time they
were taken at the sub-treasury. In fact
gold was paid out right along for them un
til the order of the Treasury Department
was issued about ten days ago and that
put a stop to that practice. Gold is at a
premium, and it was possible to turn in
silvercertiticates here and get gojd out.
and for $1,000,000 in gold obtained in this
way a profit of $40,000 could be realized
when if was disposed of.
"There is no money to be made in ex
change between New York and San Fran
cisco because exchange is at a discount.
The financial policy of this Democratic
administration has been very bad. The
sub-treasuries in the East have paid out
gold for National bank notes for one
thing, and thus the Government has been
kept on the gui vive to maintain the $100,
--000,000 gold reserve in the treasury which
is held to provide for 25 per cent of the
non-interest-bearing obligations of the
United States. The administration took
upon itself to redeem these notes from all
over the United States instead of sending
the holder away to place upon the bank
which issued the notes the redemption of
its own circulation.
"Actually there has been a great con
centration of these notes at New York,
which is as much the money center for
the United States as London is the money
center for England. 1 think it is probable
that the banks in San Francisco are forti
fying themselves with gold."
E. B. Pond of the San Francisco Sav
ings Union said last evening that he
understood that large amounts of gold
have been withdrawn from the sub-treas
ury in this City, but he had not the fig
ures, lie was not aware and dia not think
that the savings banks have withdrawn
the gold largely.
"There is gold enough in the country
and we would be all risht if the agitators
would leave us alone," said Pond.
He had no reason to assign for the re
moval of gold from the suo-treasury, but
knew, as others know, that there is a ten
dency on the part of many to hoard gold.
The large demand for gold on the local
sub-treasury practically ended last week.
High-water mark was reached one day
when about $500,000 was taken out. No
information can be secured at the sub
treasury concerning the banks or persons
who took the gold. Under the Treasury
Department regulations that information
can be furnished only by the Secretary of
the Treasury or upon his order.
Manager King of Wells, Fargo & Co.'s
Banlc said yesterday Hat he had no
knowledge concerning the subject matter.
It has been the practice of the San Fran
cisco banks in the past to deposit gold in
the sub-treasury and to draw out green
backs for shipment, because of the less
expense involved in the forwarding of the
paper money.

f?xpt filiation*
The arrow files with '.he wind. The top figure*
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
days; tliose underneath it, if any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and huudredths,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
linfs, connect pom s of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "high" means high barometric pressure and
Is usually accomonnied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" r.s; ally first appear on the Washington
coast. Whin the pressure Is high in the interior
and low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain Is probable;
but when the "low" Is Inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmel
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather ill winter. The reverse of these condition! :
ill produce an opposite result.

NEW YORK MARKETS.
Financial.
NEW YORK, N. V., Aug. 20.â engagements
of $2,000,000 gold in London yesterday for ship
ment to New York did not have the effect on stock
prices confldentally expected by operators of bull
ish proclivities. In fact, the market for securities
after a moderate advance developed weakness,
and in the final hour the lowest figures of the day
were generally current. At the start the indiffer
ence of London was a disappointment, foreign
houses having sold fairly large amounts of St. Paul
and Louisville and Nashville. Later on when the
actual rate for sterling exchanges recovered
sharply, checking further import- of gold, the bear
ish element became more agressive. Special at
tention was raid to Western Union, Sugar and the
other industrials, and in the absence of support
sellers were able to make some impression on
prices.
Sugar declined 2% to 103%; Western Union,
2t07â¬%: Chicago Gas, 3 6/ 8 to 62; Hock island
15/ 8 to 64y 8 : Northwest, iy a to 93y 2 : Louisville
and .Naslivi.ie, 11,4 to 39 an.i . .Manhattan U/ 8 to
76 1 4. In the afternoon session brokers usually
representing the leal beÂ»rs were the largest
sellers. Reports were again current that the
banks intended to issue clearing-house certificates
shortly, but this could not be confirmed. Si far as
the issue of certificates is concerned it ought to he
understood by this time thai the banks stand
ready to afford all the necessary accommodations
to the mercantile community, and that the clear
ing-house loan committee Is still In existence
with all its machinery.
If quired the committee can get to work at
once, according to its chairman, . Mr. Tuppen
Speculation closed weak in tone, with prices any
where from y* to 1 % per cent below yesterday's
final figures. Total sales were 160,957 shares
including 43,400 near, .26,300 St. Paul, 14.200
Burlington and Qoirjcyand 10,300 Western Union.

rpir/00, in,. Aug. 20. â The importance
attached to the reported gold importations was
still apparent in the tone which governed wbeat
at the opening this morning. . Prices began with
an appreciation of s/ 8 c over the close of yesterday,
but with that gain the improvement rested. Too
little business was the excuse for the halt, and
th it was also pleaded in extenuation of the later
re cession which took place. Bet eipts at Chicago
were 145 cars, and 76,109 bushels were taken
from store. The Northwest had 287 cars, against
252 last Thursday and 40s a year ago.
The Cincinnati Price i urrent reported no strik
ing changes in crop conditions during the past
week, but suggested a lowering of spring wheat
1 estimates. Liverpool cables were firm and y 2 d
higher. Closing Paris ' cables were unchanged to
10 centimes lower for flour, and unchanged to 10
centimes higher for wheat. Antwerp was un
changed, and Berlin y 2 mark higher, i- xport
clearances amounted to 396,510 bushels. Septem
ber opened from 56ysC to 56c, declined to 65V<iC,
closing at 563/gc, i/ c @ %c under yesterday.
Estimated receipts for to-morrow, 100 cars.
CORN â interest and actio , in corn were
confined to a few local traders and professionals.
The large crop Is the appalling fact which holds
bu.-ers in check, while tie low price offer little
opportunity for profitable short seeing. The Cin
cinnati Price Current said of Corn: "Moderate
drawbacks to corn in some sections, but more
than average crop certain." Receipts were 451
c irs, and 879,489 oushels were taken from store.
The tendency of prices was to follow the direction
of tbose of wheat. Some firmness at the opening
was due to the heavy out inspection. Liverpool
cables were Vie! higher. May corn opened at
27Vl@- 7s soid between 273-gc and 26% c, clos
ing Â»c 20%(527c, Yg(a.V4:C under yesterday. Esti
mated receipts for 10-morrow, 450 cars.
OATSâ The same spirit of firmness that has
prevailed recently In oats obtained in the market
for that grain' to-day. The sentiment continued
I bullish. Receipts were 195 cars, and 104,925
bus.iels were taken from store. . The weakness of
wheat Influenced the tone of oats late in the ses
sion, causing some depreciation. M ay oats closed
ygc under yesterday. Estimated receipts for to
morrow, 195 cars.
1 FLAXâ Was steady. Cash Northwestern and
! Southwestern, 6t>y c to 66c; September, 6 : Jy 2 c to
66c: December, 70c. Receipts were 91 cars.
I PROVISIONSâ Adverse information was re
ceived from the yards this morning and product,
naturally, wag guided thereov. . A fairly good busi
ness was transacted.' The growing belief that the
reported deal in September pork is a myth tends
to impart courage to the bear, contingent and ren
ders the task 01 the bull more difficult. Prices ral
lied late in the session on the inevitable short cov
ering. January pork closed 2 %c under yesterday !
and January lard and ribs each a shade higher.

down in Wool town. All the scounng-mills are
closed down, with no chance or starting up again
for some time, as both speculative - and legitimate
trade has ceased for the time being. Commission
houses prefer not to accept consignments for the
reason that Wools have to be stored indefinitely
and, moreover, money cannot b* readily obtained- !
with .which to I pay freight and make even the 1

Oakland Office San Francisco Call, >
908 Broadway, August 20. i
The great debate between Hon. James G.
Magruire and Colonel John P. Irish to -k place
this evening at the MacdonougQ Theater be
fore an audience that resembled a "first-night"
attendance more than a crowd usually seun at
political meeting.
The chairman, John Lvncb, introduced the
s-peakers and thanked them on behalf of the
Catholic Ladies' Aid Society, for the benefit of
wnich institution the debate was given.
The subject of the argument was: "The Free
and Unlimited Coinage of Silver at the Ratio
of 16 to 1 Without Waiting for the Consent of
Any Other Nation."
Congressman Maguire took the affirmative
and John P. Irish the negative side of the
argument.
The audience, judging from its applause,
seemed to be about evenly divided, and the
keenness of the speeches and the many pleas
antries were highly appreciated.
Once when Mr. Maguire locked at the time
he provoked a laugh by holding out a watch
and saying, "You see I am consistent; I carry
a nickel watch."
Colonel Irish wore a beautiful gold watch,
but he did not refer to it.
Congressman Maguire was the first speaker,
and, after a few introductory remarks, includ
ing a tribute to Colonel Irish's oratorical
power, he said:
"My argument is that we should commence
the coiuage of silver at the ratio of 16 to 1,
without waiting for the consent of edy other
nation to change our laws. I agree with
Thomas H. Benton that Congress has no power
to demonetize either gold or silver. For
eighty-one years, ended 187S-. silver never lell
below the valuation of its c.-tatjlished ratio.
During that period there was uo trouble witn
the money question. Previous to the demone
tization of Bllver it did not cost this country a
cent to adjust her financial transactions
with other countries more than the
cost of mintage, ihe act of 1873, if it is good.
should be continued, if bad it should bÂ« dis
continued, to I shall say nothing about 'the
crime of '73.'
"Is our present system a good system? It
stands condemned by the National conven
tions of Populists, Democrats and Republi
cans. The Republicans condemn it with the
single qualification that we should inaugurate
bimetallism in connection with other coun
tries. Go.d does not exist in sufficient quan
titie* to be used as redemption money by the
many countries who demand a gold standard.
Scarce money is the banker's money. Once
Lombard street and Wall street monopolize it
they can dictate the terms of its use. They
have controlled it, and now they can do and
are doing practically as they like. The evils
ot a gold monopoly am not imaginary, but
they are real. Is gold monopolized?
"In February, 1895, the United States Govern
ment, in ordt-r to maintain the parity between
gold and siiver, had to pay the difference be
tween the market value of gold and silver to
meet its obligations. We have thus incurred
in time of peace obligations amounting to
$262,000,000 and interest during the next
thirty yearo amounting to .$270,000,000. And
this has been done to maintain the parity for
only three years. Look at the history of the
Morgan syndicate. They boasted tnat they
controlled" the gold of the United States out-
Bide of, perhaps, $2,000,000 of surplus coinage
in California. They dictated their terms and
saia that they controlled the channel through
which gold could be obtained from Europe,
and they agreed that if all the bond issue were
told to them they would agree that for eight
months no man should draw a dollar of money
out of the Treasury of the United States. Think
of that.
"If that little syndicate wag satisfied they
would protect our Government, if not they
would cripple it and sacrifice the interests of
the seventy million people of our country."
Colonel John P. Irish was then introduced,
and said:
"I am not here to discuss the Morgan syndi
cate and the monopolizing cf gold, because if
such things are possible it is the fault of the
advocates of silver iv Congress. In 1878
Silver Dick Bland appeared as the friend of
fcilver, and he assured the country that if they
passed the Bland act silver would at once rise
in vauie to gold. A few years later Mr. Bland
altered his figures ana his opinion and stood
before the world as a discredited prophet,
"The act of 1890 required that the Nation
should maintain the parity of gold and silver
at 16 to 1. Silver fell and the Government
had to make up the difference and had to
borrow or beg gold as best it could.
"Such things are the result of such million
aires as Teller and Hay ward who want to have
something done ior them to save them from
pauperism. When a popular loan was asked
J>y the Government last year $640,000,000 was
offered the Government by people from all
parts of^the country, and this denies positively
the Statement that there is a monopoly of gold
at this time.
"The laws that govern circulation are
natural and must be discovered as other laws
must be, and I maintain that in the past
fifty years we have male pome progress in our
study of finance. My friend has spoken of
Jefferson. If Jefferson was followed out we
should have a dollar to-night sixteen times as
large as a gold dollar. Politiciansâ thank
God, I nev*Â»r was one â say that the gold stand
ard enslaves us to England. I say it emanci
pates us from England.
"Why do they not say Germany as well as
England? Because there are more German
voles in this country and they must not be
antagonized.
"Every silver nation on earth is a slave to
the gold nation. The ratio between the two
metals is purely one of their commercial value
and cannot be regulated by any act ot Con
gress that does not change as often as does the
respective values of the two metals.
"If there were any crime of 1873 it was done
in 1853 and my friend merely erects a tomb
stone over a corpse twenty years old. Every
silver dollar made since 1873 is worth 100
cents, and we have nearly twice as much cir
culation per capita as we had prior to 1860.
"The gold-standard nations have about $15
per head in circulation and the silver nations
have but $5, and yet our silver friends want us
to join the $5 crowd. It is not more money
that we want, but more activity, because
activity is the child of confidence. Free silver
coinage has always produced distress and no
where has it been felt more than by the
laborers.
"Silver was the money of old. Judea and the
usurers soon found out that they could get
rich oy handling it on account of its fluctua
tions, and thai is why it is that when Christ
went into the temple he found it full oi silver
jnoney changers and he scourged them and
drove them out, and they deserved it."
Congrebsman Maguire replied:
"Colonel Irish's language is interesting even
to an antagonist. Referring; to the popular
loan of February, 1896, Colonel lrith Feems to
forget the facts In the case. Before the loai*
was made popuiar an oral agreement had been
jnade between the Morgan syndicate and the
Secretary of theTreasuiy that the >yndicate
should have all the oonds. It was only when
the great papers of the country created such
sentiment that the scheme failed and the Sec
retary was forced to obey the popular voice.
-â¢< 'What proof is tnere ot this oral agree
ment?' asked Colonel Irish. I refer to the
published reports of the time, and which were
not contradicted. Even with the popular loan
the Morgan syndicate got nearly ah the bonds,
rind so threatened and dictated that they
1 roved the existence of their monopolization
of gold more than ever. We are told that
silver fluctuates. Is that true? You cannot
tell tiy comparing gold and silver, because the
unit goes up and down with gold and it al
ways appears as of stationary value, while
Fnver is at present not a standard and does
f.uctunte. '
"With respect to gold, silver has certainly
fallen, and so in this way has every other com
modity, anrt it has fallen in proportion to the
fall of silver. The gold men say that silver
has fallen because of overproduction and in
ventions nn<i improved method. In no product
has the cost of production been lowered by in
vention more than the production of gold.
Gold has in reality been the fluctuating me
dium and uot silver. The act of 1873 caused
a falling off in the absorbtion of silver, and the
arts failing to need It and use it silver has
fallen and it is now worth 70 cents an ounce,
which is about its cost of production. Flexl
bilitv in our "currency has always been de
manded and is needed, but with a goid stan
dard this is impossible."
Colonel Irish again took the floor and said:
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am willing to ad
mit that I have more wit than wisdom, but I
do thnnk God I am not devoid cf both. Ido
not deny the Morgan syndicate, but I attack
the law-making body that mitkes t-uch things
possible. Igo behind the cause to the effect â
the law that enables him to exist.
"The statement made by my friend that an
oral agreement between Morgan aud the becre
tflry of the Treasury was broken up by the New
York World. I know of a personal knowledge
that the contract advertising the bonds was
prepared twenty-four hours before the New
York World published a line about the matter.
'â¢1 must deny this or 1 would not be true to
my party, which at this time is very small and
very select. Ido not wish to i.c personal, but
1 did think that the Congrers tnat preceded
the one just adjourned was determined to go
into history as the most contemptible body
that ever sat in the National halis of legisln
lation. Now I think that the last Congress U
runniiig a neck and neck race for that honor.
"No nation has ever succeeded in maintain
ing a ratio contrary to nature's law. If such
a law regulating silver as is proposed by our
Populist friends ever be passed the gold will
rapidly disappear. Senator Stewart has prob
ably lorty mortgages on record in this county
all payable in gold. If Judge Maguire gets
his way in Congrees everyoodv would at once
draw their money out of the banKS and hold
on to it. Gold would at once Decotne scarce
and tenator Stewart's creditors would have to
come to people who have gold and buy it at
any premium that could be demanded to pay
their gold contracts with the Senator.
"The Chicago platform is a threat and the
men who made it are responsible for the hard
times. They are the meu who are the cause of
those evils that are putting out firesou hearth
stones and taking bread from thousands of
mouths.
"Make these men understand that they must
withdraw their threat and that confidence
must be restored, and then fires will be re
lighted and prosperity will return aud happi
neaa Â« 111 agnin t>o in our land. It is not more
money that we want, but activity. We want
sucn conditions that will enable us to use and
get the full benefit of what we have.
"Facts do not bear out my friend's state
ment. Mr. Carlisle and Mr. Cleveland are not
responsible for our present financial condi
tion*. Congress is r3sponsible. The President
and the Secretary are bound by oath to obey
the luw that Congress made, aud they must
maintain that treasury reserve or break their
oaths. Just so long as our silver friends hold
out tiieir threat ot iree-siiver coinage, just so
long will our monetary system be a curio
among the systems of the world.
"Gold is the more stable of the two metals
aud must naturally be the standard, and as
there oan be but one standard the other metal
must be guided by it. 1 would like some con
sistency and would like to see ttie mane and
tail ot the horse of something near the same
color. The Judge has carefully avoided any
reference tc the amount of money per capita
in Circulation in gold and silver countries.
For my part, I want to live in a civilized
country. Japan and Mexico are not to my
liking. Foliow the advice of my friend St.
Paul and hold fast to that which is good."
Judge Maguire closed the debate in the fol
lowing words:
"Money is not a creation of government, but
of the necessities of trade. The governments
have exceeded their functions and are now
forbidding the people to use in unlimited
quantities one of the greatest of their com
moditiesâsilver. The laws that are needed
are such that will enable the people to use
what money they please iv quantities that
they please, independent of tne exactions and
dictations of any of the money centers to
which ye at present pay enormous tribute.
â â¢Mr. Irish says tnat tne idea of 16 to 1 is
ephemeral and not founded on experience.
When silver was "iemonetized it stood in Lon
don at the ratio of 14.92 to 1 of gold, and for
200 years we have had that experience, aud
shall we go back on it at this time when in all
human probability 16 to 1 wih prove itself to
be the exact and true ratio?"

Work.

Smith's Creefc, near Haywards, will
henceforth be known as a local Garden of
Tbe Midnight Alarm at tbe Camp of the Episcopal Guild at Smiths Creek
That Was Attacked by Kattlcsnakes.
Eden. One of the happiest gatherines
that ever went camping was hurriedly
broken up two nights' ago by a nest of
rattlesnakes.
Fifteen young ladies and seven young
gentlemen, several of whom were brothers
and sisters, and just enough of older anu
wiser heads to preserve dignity, the whole
comprising the .Guild of the Haywards
Episcopal Church, went into camp last
Sa;urday night. A few light tents were
pitched and other preparations made, and
as the night was one of the fairest of the
fair the camp and the location and the
surroundings were idealistic. A little
luncheon was partaken of, a little dance
was indulged in and some stories of former
camps were repeated and then the
campers retired.
The young gentlemen were A. Bridge,
J. Mazza, J. Bassett, F. Gebhardt, F.
Glazier, J. Joseph and J. Hamilton and
they decided to take turns at remaining
on guard.
A few short watches and the sentinels
found time hanging heavily on their
hands. The beautiful night air had a
somnolent effect, and the sentries who
had loaded their guns with the hope of
being required to defend their lives and
their friends began to think that there
were more exciting experiences than
keeping guard over a sleeping camp.
John Bassett had not been on deck lone
before there was a change. He heard
something creeping about in the bushes,
and a moment later he was satisfied that
there were enemies all around the camp.
There was a shot and an alarm, and then
there was a chorus of shrieks and cries,
and in an instant the peaceful camp was
turned into a scene of turmoil.
The danger was soon located. The camp
had for neighbors a large nest of rattle
snakes, and they were as hostile as they
knew how to be. The youths soon ap
peared, and the battle began. The de
fenders were cheered on by their sisters.
Miss Lulu Ãbhoff and Miss Jessie Hill
peeped out of one tent, and Miss Lizzie
Neudeck and Ella and Blanche Bridge
viewed the scene from another, and one
or two took to flight and tried to mount
trees. After a half-hour's fight the last
rattler was either killed or had slunk
away, and a count showed that just ten of
the reptiles had been slaughtered. There
was no more sleeping that night, ana next
morning the camp moved to a spot that
was free from rattlesnakes.
The merry campers are loud in their de
nunciations of a fate that allowed snakes
to come in and break up their Eaenic nap
piness.
The rest of the party consisted of Mrs.
Ãbhoff, Miss Christenson, Miss Glazier,
Miss Armstrong, Beatrice Decamp, Mary
Anway, Miss French and Miss Chopin.
John Bassett, the plucky sentinel who
detected the rattlers, is to be suitably re
warded, and is even now called "captain."
SWINDLED MERCHANTS.
A Smooth Individual Secures Goods
From Yarions Firms and
Disappears.
OAKLAND, Cal., Aug. 20.â The police
were notified to-day that a smootn indi
vidual, purporting to be a Sobrante mer
chant, was victimizing merchants of this
city and San Fraucisco by purchasing
small bills of eoods on credit. He carried
letters wuh which he was always enabled
to carry out his schemes.
James Kendall, the coffee merchant, is
one of the men lately swindled. He says
he did not know that he was beine
"marked" for some time after his dealings
with the man.
The man carried off goods amounting to
$35. In due course of lime Mr. Kendall
looked for a remittance from Sobrante.
As it did not put in an appearance, he
went out to look the man up. There he
discovered that the man was not known
at ail. The place has only one
store, which is conducted by an old resi
dent.
When following his swindling opera
tions the man loaded his purchases into a
wagon as if he was eoing right out to his
place of business. In all of his transac
tions he was never known to go above $50
in any one deal. If caught, the most seri
ous charge that can be placed against him
will be misdemeanor.
EXPOSED ON A POSTAL
Judge Greene Notified That a Tales
man Imposed Upon the Court to
Escape Jury Duty.
OAKLAND, Cal., Aug. 20.â N0 small
amount of excitement was created this
morning in the Superior Court, when
Judge Greene announced that he had re
ceived a postal card which he read. It is
as follows:
My Dear Judge: In open court Poorman
swore that he was sick and had to go to the
springs, and he could not serve on the jury.
H â  deceived you. He is arouud Oakland, .<md
never did go away. A man who will do tliat
is a perjurer. If you do not make him serve
like the rest of us you will hear me speak. You
muat bring him into court. Juror.
The Judge asked the party writing the
s-ame to come forward and acknowledge
the same and speak up, as he had prom
ised to do, but no one responded. He
then declared that if the writer would sub
stantiate his statement, all the powers of
the court and District Attorney's office
would be placed at his disposal to bring
Mr. Poorman to account, if he had im
posed on the court.
Judge Greene said he discharged his
duty without fear or favor, and that he
proposed to treat all citizens alike in re
gard to jury duty, and no man would be
excused unless for legal cause upon
proper showing. He said the court would
pay no attention to anonymous communi
cations. He thought it was cowardly for
any person to make charges in such a way
and not be willing to substantiate them
when calied upon to do so. No further
action was taken, as no one would appear.
PAID HIM TO LEAVE.
i Richard Foloy in New Mexico While
John Bernal Is on Trial for
Shooting Him.
OAKLAND, Cal., Aug. 20.â Sheriff
White made return upon the subpena for
Richard Foley that he had made diligent
| search for him but failed to locate his
| whereabouts.
The case of John Bernal, who is charged
! with an assault to murder Foley, was on
i trial in Judge Greene's court. Foley's
| name was called at the door, but there
| was no answer, for the missing man was
J playing in the United States military
| band at Fort Wingate, New Mexico.
The jury selected to try the case was:
Henry Menges, Frederick Bryant, Fritz
I Koehnier, James E. Clark, A. t: Barber,
|M. Bryne, Louis Hoffschmidt, E. M.
I Lipka, M. Duddy, G. W. Boynton and 0.
B. Davis.
Bernal admits the shooting and paid
1 Foley 'a expenses out of the country to
save prosecution. He took Foley for ai
intruder upon the premises of a Spanish
widow, Mrs. Alviso, at PJeasanton on the
morning of November 18 last year.
THEY ARE SURPRISED.
Saloon at- JP ruitvale Avenue Without
the Knowledge of the Resi
dents of the Vicinity.
OAKLAND, Cal., Aug. 20.â Ho* that a
room has been fitted up and a license
granted for a saloon at East Fourteenth
street and Fruiivale avenue the residents
have avrakened to the fact that they have
been outwitted by the saloon man and
declare that henceforth they will scan the
published accounts of the proceedings of
the County Board of Supervisors.
On July 20 J. F. Valladao, who formerly
conducted a saloon near ttie broad-gauge
station, on the avenue, applied to the
Supervisors for a new license, and on July
27 it was eranted. "Major" J. H. W.
Riley and Mrs. Henry Wetherbee reside
in the immediate vicinity and have man
aged to keep all saloons away from the
corner heretofore.
It may be that the Fruitvale Sanitary
Board will take a hana in the matter, as it
is authorized to do under the law.
DAVILE ROUBLES.
Charged With Using: Vulgar Language
on the Street.
OAKLAND, Cal., Aug. 20.â Prosecuting
Attorney Melvin made out a complaint
this morning charging Mayor John L. Da
vie with using vulgar language on the
streets Saturday night. The complaining
witness was J. C. Buttner, the well-known
Populist and a delegate to the recent Na
tional Populist Convention at St. Louis.
Judge Wood of the Police Court, however,
has taken under advisement the matter of
issuing a warrant until to-morrow.
When seen Mr. Buttner refused to make
any statement, saying he would tell the
whole story in court. He admitted that
the objectionable language was not di
rected at him particularly, but was used
in his presence and that of other parties.
Among the latter was J. B. Randolph,
who is much surprised at Buttner's action.
"Mayor Davie and Mr. Buttner were
talking on Broadway," said he, "when
Buttner disputed Davie's statements about
his being read out of the Populist party.
Davie then used the language to which
Buttner now takes exception, but he did
not speak in a loud tone, and he glanced
around to see tnat no one was about when
he spoke. I think Buttner is making a
bad move to file such a charge."
Insolvent Saloon Men.
John and Frederick Dleling, saloon-keepers,
doing business under the name of John Diel
ing, have filed a petition in insolvency. Tb.e
firm owes $921 37 and Frederick peiltng owes
$310. Their entire assets amount >o about
$100.
MINA TRIMMER
WAS WHIPPED,
Her Mother, Who Is an
Oakland Evangelist,
Says So.
SECRET OF THE SCANDAL
Jealousy Eecause Mina's Brother
Secured Miss Clarrage's
Brother's Pi ace.
BIG BROTHERS HEARD FROM-
They Have Been Restrained Hitherto
by Their Mothers, Who Dis
like Notoriety.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Aug. 20. j
At last tbe secret is out.
Miss Mina Trimmer, the San Francisco
dressmaker, was horsewhipped by Miss
Elaine Clarrage. Miss Zimraer's denial of
the whipping is false, and her clever little
ptory of mistaken identity is equally so.
It is Miss Trimmer's own mother who is
the authority for the statement.
The cause of tho little scene on an Oak
land street corner a few days ago, the re
sult of which is an ugly welt on Mina's
fair cheek, was due to Miss Elaine Clar
rage's anger that Miss Zimmer's brother
had been put in Ed Clarrage's place in a
San Francisco store.
Miss Trimmer's mother is Mrs. C. Â£.
Thurston, a prominent Oakland evangelist,
who was a witness in the Brown-Overman
case in the Police Court. Mrs. Thurston
is an active Christian worker and is known
thronehout the State for her good and
iaithful work. At present she and her
husband are conducting what is called
the "Watcher's Mission" in a large tent
on the northeast corner of Ninth and Clay
streets, in this city.
When seen this evening she admitted
that her daughter was the one mixed up
in the Clarrage-Trimmer affair. "God
only knows how I feel over the affair,"
said she, "and I feel that in a way my
daughter was to blame. She had no busi
ness to have a quarrel with anyone on the
public street, and it she bad not this
would never have occurred. Young Clar
rage and his sister followed her several
blocks, and several times they had hard
words. vVhen they reached the wagon
Miss Clarrage took the whip and struck
my daughter over the head. Mina jumped
behind the young man and when the
opportunity offered wrenched the whip
away.
"I have two sons in San Francisco who
are desperate over the affair, ana I had
all I could do to keep them from taking
the affair in their own hands and ad
ministering personal chastisement to the
Clarrages. By pleading with them to
spare their own good names and that of
their mother they were restrained.
"It is a disgraceful affair any way, but
I know my daughter is innocent of any
wrongdoing. 1 have been in Oakland
three years and she has never been here
during that time.
"So far as I can learn the whole affair is
the outgrowth of a jealousy regarding one
of my sons. Clarrage worked for a shoe
firm in San Francisco for a while, but
failed to keep his position and my son se
cured it.
"The stories about Mina and Mr. Clar
rage are false in every particular, and so
is the absurd story being circulated that
my daughter once attempted to commit
suicide."
Clarrage is a Grand Army man and a
member of a post. He lives with his wife
and children and is respected by his com
rades. He has strenuously denied any re
gard for Miss Trimmer and is very angry
ai the statements made by his children.
WILL FARES BE CHARGED?
The Prevailing Opinion Is in the
Affirmative in Spite of Fill
more's Statement
Eviction of Sadie Casper Fo lowed by
Her Disappearance â Her Belong-
ings Left on the Sidewalk.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Aug. 20.â The gates
on the local trains and the stopping of
free travel are occupying at present a large
share of public attention. The prevailing
opinion is that fares are going to be
charged, but what that opinion is based
on it is impossible to decipher. The ten
dency of the Southern Pacific to make
traffic carry all it will bear and two local
manifestations are all at present that is
above ground.
On Saturday evening George Blancbard
of High street exhibited a letter from Su
perintendent Fillmore on Park street,
which said that Mr. Blanch ard would be
appointed to sell tickets at High street, on
the narrow-gauge line, in a few days.
From this it is conjectured that fares are
gome to be charged.
The erection of a large and commodious
depot, to be known as Sather station, just
where the Laundry Farm electric road
crosses the Seventh-street Oakiand Rail
way line, is taken as another indication
that the Alameda broad-gauge trains will
run out there, and only persons allowed to
board the trains who possess tickets for
Bather or San Francisco. It is also said
that it is t.e intention of the company to
run a loop-line train on the Seventh-street
Oakland local and the Oakland broad
gauge.
Superintendent Fillmore told City Trus
tee Hammond in June that the company
had no intention of charging fares for
riding within the city limits, though they
intended to put gates on. If Mr. Fillmore's
statement be not adhered to the City Trus
tees will be heard from.
An Eviction.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Aug. 30.â A middle
aged woman named Sadie Casper, living
at the corner of Oak street and Alameda
avenue, had her household belongings
dumped into the street this morning for
the non-payment of rent, at the instance
of Hall & Baird, agents Jor Owen Tuttle of
Redwood City. The furniture and effects
were on the sidewalk at 9 p. m., and the
whereabouts of the owner could not be
discovered. She was seen after the evic
tion to go down Oak street 10 the beach,
but no trace can be found of her to-night,
though quite a number of searchers are
out.
Dr. Bovard tried to make arrangements
to store the furniture, but no one would
touch it without authority. Mrs. Casper
has iivea as a dressmaker here for the past
four years. Her husband, from whom she
is separated, is said to be in Ban Francisco.
Over twelve months ago she brought
action against George genner and wife for
damages in the sum of $299, but the jury

RAISING THE STANDARD.
Report on the Applicants for
Admission to the State
University.
Athletes to Meet for the Selection of
Good Fcotb.il Mate
rial.
BERKELEY, Cal., Aug. 20.â The first
complete official report of the number of
applications for admission to the univer
sity this term, the number of rejected and
the number still under consideration was
given this afternoon to a Call correspond
ent by Professor Henry Senger, chairman
of the committee on admissions.
"The total number of applications re
ceived to date," said Professor Senger, "is
612. Of these 378 have been admitted to
regular standing and forty-one to special
standing, making in all 419 thus far ad
mitted ; 102 app lications have been rejected
outright, and forty-nine for special stand
ing and forty-two for regular under-gradu
ate standing are still pending.
"In this total of t>l2 cbe applications for
graduate standing are not included. More
applications from undergraduate s.u
dents, as well as the graduates, are ex
pected, ana so, when they are all in, we
may have something over 700 applica
tions altogether."
The percentage of applications rejected
this year does not equal that of the year
of 1895. Last year 27 per cent of the ap
plications for standing in all three depart
ments, graduate, regular and special, were
rejected, while this year only 21 per cent
have been rejected thus far.
In 1895 556 applications were received,
27 per cent of which were rejected; in
1894 517 were received, 22 per cent of
which were rejected; in 1893 the number
received was 357, and the number rejected
amounted to 20 tier cent; in 1892 27, were
received, and in 1891 252 were received. In
both these years 10 per cent were thrown
out. These figures, as furnished by Pro
fessor Senger, show a decided raising of
the standard of requiremÂ«jnt from year to
year. Though bin 217 of the appli
cations which have been received thus
far this year have been cast out, yet there
are still a sufficient numbec pending fur
ther consideration to raise the number of
unsuccessful applicants to 30 per cent. By
subtracting the percentoee of rejected ap
plicants in '91 from the percentage Â»of re
jected applicants of '96 it would seem that
the standard of requirement had been
raised at least 15 per cent in the last five
years.
The courses of study in the university
and the requirements from students after
they have entered are said to have in
creased in a corresponding ratio. If this
be true it would seem that a diploma
from Berkeley to-day is worth 15 per cent
more than tne diploma of '91.
First Call for Players.
BERKELEY, Cal., Aug. 20.â The foot
ball season at Berkeley will open next
Tuesday, for on that day Captain Ransome

REPAYING HAS BEGUN,
Contractors at Work on Folsom
Street Will Hurry It
Through.
Expert George W. Elder Says He Will
Oppose Any Extension of Tims
on tbe Contract.
The improvement of Folsom street has
begun. The long anticipated boulevard
is assuming the appearance of a reality.
The people have been patient until
patience almost ceased to be a virtue with
regard to the beginning of the work. The
contract was let July 22, almost a month
ago, and only yesterday Contractors A. B.
Clute and Harney set their first gang of
men to work. They promise, under the
sharp surveillance of Expert Elder, to
push the work to a quick conclusion. The
time limit is October 22.
The executive committee of the Folsom
street Improvement Club held a meeting a
few nights ago, at which resolutions were
passed declaring for active measures
against the contractor unless work was
commenced immediately. A subcommittee
was appointed to see Kxpert to the Street
Committee George W. Elder and secure
his active co-operation. Mr. Elder had
been giving considerable attention to the
matter previously, but on Monday visited
Clute and told him be must begin tbe
work at once; that he (Elder) would cer
tainly oppose tbe granting of any exten
sion of time on the contract, but that the
penalty clause would be allowed to get in
its expensive work for every day that the
job remained unlinished after the expira
tion of tbe time limit.
The spurred the contractor put a force
of men at work yesterday morning, and,
as stated, declares his intention of pat
ting Folsom street in excellent condition
before the end of October.
"This is one of the most important
piecfcS of street work that have been under
taken in the City for some time," said
Mr. Elder, speaking of the matter yester
day. "The peopie of the Mission and all
of the South Side have been clamoring for
the improvement for a long time. The
City has ordered the work to be done, and
now there is no reason why it should not
be done, and that promptly. As regards
the portion of Folsom street not included
in the contract for the improvement, I
have to say that I will ur^e at the next
meeting of the Board of Supervisors that
enough money be get aside out of the
Street Department fund to cover that
work. Wnen'the present contract is com
pleted there will only remain to be paved
the block between Ninth and Tenth streets
and the crossing at Eleventh and Twelfth
streets. It would be ridiculous to allow
this slight interruption to remain be
tween a complete and an imperfect
job. This being done, the South
Side will have one of the handsomest
thoroughfares in tbe City, an uninter
rupted stretch of smooth pavement from
East to Twenty-sixth street, and the
dieam of the people of the Mission, or
one of their enterprising dreams, will have
been realized. It will be one big step in
the right direction, for the City of San
Francisco should and certainly will have
other streets over which it is not an abso
lute pain to drive a horse or ride a bike.
Market street stands next in line. It cer
tainly should be repaved with something
more modern than basalt blocks.
"The portion of Folsom street not cov
ered in the contract from Third street to
the wharf is in a deplorable condition and
demands repaying. Much of it is now
paved with cobbles, and very badly paved
at that. It should be bituminized at an
early date."
The largest bell in America is said to be
one m the cathedral of Montreal, which
weighs 88,000 pounds.

WANT THE LAW TO

Rent.
AFTERMATH OF NOBLE.
Tinkling Tale of a Depleted Sup
ply of Nickel Telephone
Tokens.
ABSENT BUT NOT FOEGOTTEN.
An Agent Who Has Lett a Large
Number of San Franciscans
in Suspense.
Persons having some personal interest
concerning the present whereabouts of
Cyrus D. Noble, late agent and representa
tive in this City of the Dcs Moines Life
Association, might be excused for some
coufusion in their understandings. There
is documentary evidence that he is
in Portland, Or., in Red Bluff, Cal., that
his destination is Los Angeles, and that
he has already started East from Portland,
Or., or is about so to do, having in view
Minneapolis as his next place of residence.
Gentlemen who have trusted him for
clothes, or who have performed dental
operations in the expectation that the
operations would pull in receipts for life
insurance premiums, may be pleased to
know that tiieir uncertainty may soon be
cleared up.
Attorney L. E. Phillips yesterday re
ceived a letter from C. E. Rawson, which
was written on a letter-sheet with the
business heading and addresses of the of
ficers of the Dcs Moines Life Association
at the top, which left Dcs Moines some
days ago. In fact, when Mr. Rawson
mailed this letter in his capacity of presi
dent and general manager of the Dcs
Moines Life Association, his San Fran
cisco representative had already departed.
But some light is thrown upon the situ
ation by Mr. Rawson's communication,
for in it occurs these words : "Mr. Noble
has instructed me that his address is Red
Bluff." There is still another letter from
an official of tbe Dcs Moines association
which says that "Mr. Nob'e writes that
he is about to develop the field in the in
terior of tne State and will pass the win
ter in Los Angeles." The clearest in
formation and the latest is that Mr. Noble
has ordered that his mail shall be for
warded by the postal authorities to Min
neapolis, which seems to indicate that in
the cooler months he will enjoy lake
breezes ratner than zephyrs scented by
blowing through Southern California
orange groves.
Within the iast two days suits have
been tiled in the Justices' Court to recover
from tbe Dcs Moines Life Association
sums due from the agent on account of
the corporation and which were incurred
ou behalf of the corporation. One of these
was to recover the balance of salary due
Attorney Phillips as counsel for the life
association, vesierday being the day upon
which Mr. Phillips' first semi-annual in
stallment for counsel fees fell due. Mr.
Phillips took the precaution to have his
engaeement as counsel put in writing by
Mr. Noble when he was acting as age n't
for the corporation and when his position
as such agent was recognized by the lowa
concern. On the life policy which Mr.
Phillips took out was an, indorsement
which attested to the same official fact.
The other suit brought ln the local
courts agaiirst the corporation joins
the claim of John Bardulin, tailor, with
the claim of Mr. Phillips for unpaid office
rent. Both claims have been assigned to
Luther Everett, who appears as the plain
tiff in the s,uit. Whether the lowa Life
Association will acknowledge the claims
for rent and counsel fees remains to be
seen, but it is very likely that they will
disown responsibility for the fine suits of
clothes which the agent ordered from Mr.
Bardulin for his own adornment.
Notwithstanding the absolute denial of
the fact by the young lady wbo was en
gaged to Mr. Noble that such an engage
ment existed and that it was entered into
upon her second meeting with Noble, it is
learned that the young lady's family took
a lively interest in the matter and went to
the extent of consulting a lawyer, with or
without the Kuowledge that she had al
ready taken tbe same means to ascertain
what could be done.
She was spoken to yesterday and de
nied tne engagement, but said that she
was sure Mr.lS"ob!e had many lady friends
In San Francisco; she knew that to be so.
When she was toll that several profes
sional men would like to know where Mr.
Isoble had pone she expressed surprise to
hear that he had departed. When she was
asked what sort of a looking man Mr.
Noble is she returned the characteristi
cally feminine response that whether a
man is good looking or not is a matter
entirely of taste; and whether he appears
young or otherwise depends upon how
v,pU he is preserved.
Attorney Phillips, who gave Mr. Noble
the use of his telephone as a part of the
accommodation going in with the office
rent, is morally convinced that Mr. Noble
talked with enough young ladies through
the phone to constitute a iarge delegation
to a young and pretty women's congress.
At firs;, there was a daily metallic and
dull but eminently satisfactory and sol
vent rattling of nickels into the machine
in the jointly occupied office.
The robbery of telephone boxes led the
telephone company some time ago to in
stitute nickel or lead tokens to take the
place of tbe real nickels in the slot. Many
citizens buy theso tokens and" Mr. Phillips
laid in a satisfactory supply. These went
away with the speed of hot butter on a
July day. Mr. Pnillips says that he did
not use them. The office clerks used them
not. Reasoning another way, it is sup
posed that i\fr. Noble helped to swell the
bill for switches with the aid of the tokens,
nnd that bill for one month, just prior to
Mr. Nobie's departure, assumed unheard
of and staggering proportion?. The re
sult of the continual use of the wire was
the creation of an impression in the build
ing at 405 Montgomery street that a large
portion of the young women of the City,
and especially tbe pretty ones, had sud
denly come to a realizing sense of the un
certainty of life and a lively apprecation of
the advantages of taking out a policy of
life insurance in the office of the dapper
and gay young agent of the lowa concern.
When returns come in from the interior
now facts may be learned concerning the
methods pursued in interior towns to have
life policies written.
FORFEii iJD HIS BAIL.
Captain Hagen, Charged With Perjury,
Takes His Departure.
Captain H. S. T. Hagen sailed from this
port last week and is now believed to be
on his way to the Orient. : He has forfeited
$500 cash bail which he deposited to secure
his appearance in Judge : Joachimsen's
:ourt on the charge of perjury in : falsely
â¢wearing in Judge -: Daingtrfield's court,
when obtaining citizenship papers, that he
had been on American vessels for over five
years. ;-;
Ilucen sent a letter to Judge Dainger
i
field, which is now in the possession of
Judjie Joachimsen. In the letter he said
it was better for him to leave the country
and forfeit his bail. He did not deny that
he had committed perjury, and expressed
the hope that later he might be permitted
to return to this City.
Judge Daingerfieid has taken steps to
have the naturalization certificate issued
to Hagen revoked and to have his name
stricken from the register of voters.

Bomba for Cyclists to Carry.
German cyclists have an effectual way of
getting rid of troublesome dogs, though
the method is not one which could be re
commended for use in busy thoroughfares.
Bicycle bombs are now manufactered in
the" FatherlaDd â smail but extremely
noisy explosives, which exercise a magi
cal effect, upon the cur of aggressive pro
pensities. This startling device for the J
protection of cyclists has already created
quite a scare in canine circles in the
Khineland, and a dog made in Germany
thinks twice now before attempting to
molest people on wheels. But that the
explosive lias its drawbacks, especially
when sent through the post, was shown in
a very lively fashion in a German post
office the other day while the officials were
handling a package of bomba addressed to
the Empress Frederick's residence, Schloss
Friedriehshof, Oronnerg. The crackers, in
their eagerness to get at; the dogs, ex
ploded with a tremendous report, and
thoughts of infernal machines and other
horrors instantly idvaded the official mind.
Inquiries revealed the truth, but the
manufacturer will nevertheless have to
pay a stiff tine for sending explosives
through the postoffice.â St. James Budget.

day. The plaintiff is Robert Bright, who
seeks to recover from bis sister, Mrs. Macy
Craig, valuable property which he gave
her at a time when he believed he had but
a few Hours to live. Prior to this time he
had a handsome monument erected for
himself in the Masonic Cemetery and Mrs.
Craig had selected a fine casket for his
sepulcher. Bright, who is a paralytic,
lives at 1434 Broadway.
At the time Robert Bright was par
alyzed he was posessed in his own right of
$8975 35 in the San Francisco Savings
Union, $8006 02 in the German Savings
Bank, and a lot at the northeast corner of
Broadway and Polk street, all of which,

well-known, old-time San Francisco sa
loon-keeper who made barrels of money
in bis day by dealing out his favorite hot
Scotch, at the corner of Dupont and Wash
ington streets.
Death, contrary to expectation, did not
visit the residence of the Widow Craig, at
1431 Pine street, where Bright resided at
the time, and an unpleasantness started
between them.
The waning of their affection has re
sulted in the suit brought in the Superior
Court and now pending before Judge
Hebbard. In the suit Bright asks for the
revocation of the assignment of the money
in bank and the restitution of the realty
deeded by him to his sister.
In the complaint filed by Bright,
through his attorney, James H. McKniela,
he states that his sister, the defendant, had
promised him she would dispose of such
of his property, real and personal, as he
wished, or as he had instructed to do by
will.
But in order to facilitate matters and
save the expense of a Probate Court pro
ceeding he made the assignment, believing
in the sincerity of his sister, Mary Craig,
the defendant. When he did so transfer
his money and realty be believed he was
about to die; but since that time he was
restored to health, and he wished his
money and other property returned to
him.
This complaint was filed on the 18th of
April, 1896, and two days later Judge Slack
issued a restraining order prohibiting the
defendant from either drawing or assign
ing any of the money in bank, or in any
way deeding or transferring her interest in
the real estate, if any she had.
The summons in tbe action was served
by publication upon the affidavit of
Charles W. Smith, who swore tnat when
he went to the defendant's residence at
1431 Pine street Mrs. Craig would look out
on him through the parlor window, but
would not so much as ask him what His
business was.
This line of conduct was construed by
Judge Hebbard to mean, in the language
of the Code of Civil Procedure, "evading
the process of court," and, as a remedy
made and provided in such cases, service
of summons was had b^ publication.
To tbis complaint the defendant through
her attorney, F. J. Castelhun, had de
murred, and has asked that certain lines,
words and figures in the complaint be
stricken out.
The hearing of tbis demurrer Is set for
next Friday before Judge Hebbard.
But the plaintiff, Bright, will not be
present. His deposition, however, bas
been taken and is now in the custody of
County Clerk % C. F. Curry in a sealed en
velope, where it will remain until Judge
Hebbard orders it opened and read.
The foregoing is the story as it appears
from the documents on file "in the County
Clerk's office. But an addition thereto
was obtained from the plaintiff.
To a Call representative Bright, whose
mind and memory are as clear as ever
they were, stated that he is now in his
eightieth year, and his sister is in her
seventy-seventh year and is the mother of
one Bon, who resides with her at 1431 Pine
street, where he (Bright) has resided for
fifteen years.
It was at this residence that he was
taken suddenly ill fifteen months ago, and
then he transferred all of his property to
his sister, under the belief that he had
only a few hours to live. There
was a conditional trust, however, that he
would give to the Protestant Orphan
Asylum $3000, to the Masonic Widow and
Orphan Society $3000, to the Temple Re
bekahs $500, "and smaller bequests to
numerous friends and acquaintances who
Had been close to him for years. He left
the rest to her and her son and his four
children.
It was at this time that she went to the
undertaker's and picked out the very best
casKet in the establishment for her
brother. On her return home she in
formed him of her selection.
He was well pleased and still hopes she
may keep her promise and have him
closely tucked away under its cover as
soon as tardy death makes a call on him.
The monument which will mark hislast
resting-place he had erected under his
own supervision, and the inscription
cut thereon, leaving only the date of death
to be tilled in by his Masonic brethren of
Golden Gate Lodge.
The coldness between himself and his
sister was occasioned, he says, because he
was by far too healthy an invalid to have
about. Hence he caused his own removal
to the home of Mrs. Caroline Flockhart,
an aged German lady who bas taken care
of him, and who, when he was at his sis
ter's residence, prepared and carried his
ioDd to him. This lady he wishes to pro
vide for liberally.
The Masons and Odd Fellows provide
him with a day and a night nurse. But
for this he says he will pay, as he does not
wish to be under any obligation to any
one while he has the means.
But to his sister he will leave nothing if
he can help it.
Bright is a native of Bandon, County
Cork, Ireland. He arrived in this City in
1848.
He married a widow who had one

binder at 710 Jackson street was the first to
receive attention. Mr. Holbrook had been
informed that several prirls of tender years
were living in the house, and determined,
if possible, to remove them to one of the
missions.
The proprietor of the house was evi
dently aware that a raid on his establish
ment was being contemplated, and when
the officers arrived not a girl was to be
found.
From this place the party went to a
house on the corner of Bartlett alley and
Pacific street, but were again disappointed.
A number of men employed as watchmen
by the various Chinese dens and mer
cantile establishments became aware that
their employers' houses were in danger of
being raided and gave the alarm.
This resulted in the heavy plank and
iron doors being closed against the officers.
Tie young girls were also stowed away in
almost inaccessible closets and corners.
A disreputable house run by Wong
Fook, 15 Bartlett alley, was next visited.
Owing to the alarm given by the white
watchmen not a girl could be found in the
place. ,
The officers, however, soon discovered
that the girls had been hurried through a
small door into an adjoining house run by
The officers decided to break in tbe door.
As soon as they began upon it with their
hammers and clubs the girls made a aasn
lor liberty down thi front stairs. Ihis
avenue of escape being guarded they
turned back into the building.
Several of the members escaped by vari
ous ways, but three were capturedâ Yee
Sing, Yet Heung and Tay Gum.
Miss Ida Hull of the Methodist Chinese
Mission was informed of the capture. She
procured a hack, and the three girls were
taken from their life of sbame to the Mis
sion home.
Toy Gum, one of the rescued girls, is
barely over 15 years of age. From a
Chinese standpoint s!>e is very pretty, and
her capture will in all probability cause a
bitter iegal contest.
She came to this country from China
during the Atlanta Exposition, and since
that time bas been sold into slavery three
different times. Wong Fook bought her a
few weeks ago for $2000, and it is evident
that his speculation will prove to be a
losing one.
A TARGET OF HIS HANDS.
A Ship's Steward Stood Up by Desperate
Footpada at Port Costa.
Last Wednesday night a sailor at Port
Costa was returning to bis ship, and when
a couple of hundred yards from his desti
nation was stood up by a couple of foot
pads. They ordered him to throw up his
hands, and two pistols pointed at his head
made him quickly obey. They went
through hip pockets and did not find a
cent. 1 n their anger they made him keep
his hands up and made targets out of
them. Out of four shots only one took
effect, and that went clean through the
palm of the sailor's left hand.
The British ship Springburn is at Port
Oosta loading wheat for Europe. Captain
Rae has a number of men among his crew
who have sailed with him for years, and
consequently they enjoy a great deal of
liberty when the ship is in port. They
appreciate the captain's leniency and not
one of them has ever been known to over
stay bis leave.
Last Wednesday afternoon the steward,
M. Henderson, was given a leave of ab
sence. About midnight he turned up
with his lel't hand running blood and he
almost in a fainting condition. Captain
Rae was aroused and succeeded in stanch
ing the blood. He then temporarily ban
daged the wound, and yesterday Hender
son was sent to the United States Marine
Hospital.
To tne captain the steward told the
story of the shooting. He says that two
masked men stood him up on the railway
track as be was making for the ship. They
took him for a captain and thought they
were going to make a haul. When they
did not get even a cent, one said to the
other: "Let's have some fun with the
Britisher, anyhow."
"How?" said the other.
"You take two shots at one hand and
I'll take two at the other. The man who
misses pays for the drinks."
The waier was taken and the shooting
began. Every time a gun was pointed the
sailor dropped his hands, but when hia
head was threatened he raised them
again. Out of the four shots only one
took effect, and that went through the
palm of his hand.
Such was the story told by the steward
to Captain Rae. The latter did not be
lieve it and searched the man for a pistol,
but could not find one. His room was
also searched, and while .there was no gun
there a box of cartridge? was found in one
of the drawers, lhe sailor sticks to his
story through thick and thin and the cap
tains of the ship now loading at Martinez
have now about come to the conclusion
that It was after one of themselves the
footpads were when they held up Hen
derson.

LOCAL FEDERAL COURTS
Increase in Civil and Criminal
Business Over Any Pre
ceding Year.
The Coin Paid Into the Treasury
Shows an Immense Fall*
ing Off.
The following statement shows the
number of civil and criminal cases insti
tuted during the fiscal year ending June
30, 1896. by the United States Attorney for
the Northern District of California in the
United States Circuit and District courts,
and the disposition of the cases.
Forty civil cases and 122 criminal cases
were commenced; thirty cases were tried
and closed, and 114 civil cases are now
pending.
Out of the number of criminal cases
which were pending on the Ist of July,
1895, and the number commenced during
the fiscal year ending June 30, 1896, 149
cases were disposed 01, as follows:
Seventy-nine persons were convicted,
twenty-nine acquitted, forty-five cases
were dismissed and fifty-four are now
pending.
In addition to the foregoing, 148 crim
inal cases were prosecuted before E. H.
Heacock, United States Circuit Court
Commissioner, for infractions of customs,
internal revenue, postal, pension, mari
time and navigation laws, and for other
violations of the Federal laws, all of
which cases with the exception of four or
five were examined and closed.
A large number of suits by the
United States for the purpose of review
ing the decisions of the Board of
United States General Appraisers, con
cerning the classification of merchandise
imported here by various firms, were insti
tnted in the United States Circuit Court
and disposed of. Of this class of cases
there are now pending in said court about
fifty cases, most of them known as "The
Starch Cases." The question involved in
these cases is whether the substance is
starch or tapioca. The testimony in these
cases has been taken and the causes will
be argued in the course of a few weeks.
Several other suits on appeal to the United
States Circuit Court of Appeals, in which
the Government is either a party or has an
interest, have been decided, the United
States Attorney having represented tbe
Government in sard cases by authority
from his department.
There has been a wonderful increase in
civil and criminal business within the
Dast three years. On the other hand the
Chinese business has shown a considera
ble depreciation over previous years. Ten
and fiiteen years ago it was a common
thing for the District Court to turn into
the treasury from $300,000 to $400,000 as
the result of" sales, including domestic and
foreign opium seized. During the fiscal
year just ended only $2000 was returned.
Probably the owner of the largest num
ber of dogs in the wrold is a Russian cat
tle kins, who has 35,000 shepherd dogs to
look after 1,500,000 *heep.
