THE TEKRIBLE FALL OF FIRF

While Fighting the Fire He Tcpples
From a High Corniceâ Offers
to "The Call."
Printers' row had its second Christmas
fire yesterday, and .by a strange coinci
dence the flames started in the same spot
in an alleyway between buildings. The
whole scene of three years ago when
Printers' row was visited by tire on a
Christmas day was . again enacted, the
same general alarm, The same fi : tit with
flaming paper and woodwork, only there
' was a sad accident yesterday, when Peter
McCabe, a fireman, slipped from the top
cornice of a building on Commercial street
and fell to the sidewalk, thirty or forty
feet belowâ probably fatal falL The Fire
. Department and the Underwriters' Fire
Patrol did remarkably efficient work, with
the result that only the establishment of
Francis, Valentine & Co. suffered to any
extent. â ;â â â  i- : <j''k
' Shortly after the noon hoar two bells
Â«nd then seven bells alarming the City
gave warning of the fire. The alarm was
looked for by many of the old-time print
ers and pressmen, and as 27 was. counted
more than one man exclaimed, "There
she goes again!" Then followed a general
rush to the scene of the tire, and in ten
minutes the streets around were thronged
with spectators. jjgja 'i
A second alarm rp-en forced the firemen
I already busy with the flames, which, with
the rapidity of a flash, assumed propor
tions that threatened to spread through
out the hioefc. Great masses of black
smoke rolled up from behind the building
of Francis, Valentine & Co. at 516 Com
mercial street, and , even in the brieat
light of day tongues of tire could be seen
leaping upward and cutting through the
, angry cloud.
At first sight it was hard to tell whence
the smoke and flames emanated â whether
from The Call's publishing a.nd editorial
department building at 517-519 Clay street,
or from the printing houses in the same
block. The ; firemen, however, attacked
their common enemy from front and rear
and in a very short time were victors. *-â '
The second alarm came so quickly after
the first one that .nearly all available ap
paratus was put in operation at the same
time. Streams from several engines were
united into half a dozen pipes, and these
combined soon deluged the burning
building and quenched' the blazing masses
of papers, machinery and woo' n parti
tions, though not until the bookbinding
works of the Buswell Booking and Mail
ing Company and Francis, Valentine &
Co.'s establishment were almost totally
destroyed.
The fire was first seen almost simultane
ously by nve or six men. H Cohn and
â¢W. F. Ferguson, employes of Francis,
Valentine & Co., were at lunch in Smith's
restaurant, 517 Clay street, the rear win
dows of which look into the light well
command a view of Francis, Valentine &
X)o.'fi pressrooms. Cohn and Ferguson
saw smoke in the alley and mentioned 1 1
to Smith, and then while they v:ere speak
ing tb ere came a burst of flame through
the windows.
Ferguson ran out and gave the alarm.
He encountered Thomas B. Valentine, his
employer, who was frantically shouting i
fire, and in the race were some composi
â¢ tors of The Call. They had all seen the
fire break out like an explosion.
Presently the engines and fire appara
tus were upon the scene, and as the flj/nes
were threatening relief was summoned.
In ten minutes a gallant battle had
started. On Commercial street two "siam
es d" streams were plying r at either end
of the printing house, doing excellent
work. It was the water-tower, however,
that finished the angry fare. This machine I
was hauled up immediately in front of the
burning building and let loose with sev
eral streams united in a perfect avalanche
â¢ through the top-story windows where the j
lire was raging. Wherever the nozzle: of j
the tower pointed there was darkness, for
it raked the combustible material with
mighty force and drove the fire to the wall. j
And Â»\1 this was accomplished in half' an
hour. 1 ' â¢ . ,
Meanwhile three double streams were car
ried through The Call's composing rooms
and turned into the rear of the blazing !
structure, and kept persistently upon the
upper floor and roof. Such a flood falling
â¢between the four fire- proof walls* actually
washed everything downward and from
the beginning had control of the fire in
every part of the large space affected.
An hour or two after the first burst of
flame startled ail who saw it, the fire was
extinguished. All that remained was a
wreck of the newest and most complete
printing â¢ house in San â Francisco, of
twisted and - ruined machinery, charred
timbers and . publications. But an odd
straggler remained to view the ruin, the
fire engines were gone and a few gangs of
men worked in and about the scene of
the fire. .
The . Call escaped with a few broken
panes of window glass i and some Christ
mas "pi." Charles A. Gage, day foreman
"of the composing rooms, saw the smoke
and flames that surprised the men in the
restaurant downstairs. He made a hasty
investigation and saw the light-well belch
ing forth fire and smoke from the press
The San Francisco Call
room of Valentine & Co. The first thing
he did was to turn in an alarm from the
auxiliary box in his department, and with
the assistance of several printers be closed
the iron shutters on the rear windows.
This prompt action saved the composing
department, possibly the whole building,
for the flames passed up against the iron
shutters harmlessly.
In the editorial rooms on the upper floor
Ralph Schwab, the assistant librarian,
was all alone in his glory, thinking of
mince pie and things, when the dreaded
visitor showed its head. Hs immediately
closed the iron shutters and went out to
look at the fi>e that could not get in at his
part of the house.
In the basement the fire patrol men
covered the {Treat presses and other ma
chines with water-proof sheets, and saved
the printing department of The Call.
There will be some weekly papers miss
ing to-day. Quite a collection of them was
in Busweil's bindery, which occupied half
the top floor of the burned building. They
were there to be bound, but will never ap
pear. This bindery had contracts with the
News-Letter, Breeder and Sportsman,
Hispuno Americano, Illustrated World
and other periodicals. Besides there was
a large assortment of boo&s, magaz nes,
etc., in process of binding, and all of them
were destroyed. The machinery of the
bindery was so badly burned and distorted
it is thought that it is worthless now. The
loss to the bindery company was placed at
$3000.
According to estimates of the under
writers Francis, Valentine & Co.'s loss
was about $20,000. and on the building, a
solid three-story brick structure owned by
tne J. B. Thomas estate, $7500. Blake,
MofStt & Towne's basement was invaded
by water and the loss to paper stored
there was about $100.
The loss claimed in the fire of 1803 was
$42,000, the insurance $22,000, by Francis,
Valentine & Co., and The Call Bulletin
loss was $900.
Where the Fire Started in Francis & Valentine's Premisesâ Just
After the Engines Arrived*
Thomas B. Valentine was in bin office
when the fire broke out. "Since we had
that fire three years ago Christmas day, 1 '
he said, "1 felt uneasy on this day. I
went to the office this morning about 9
o'clock and made an examination of the
whole building, peeped into every hole
and corner o! the pressroom and through
the two upper floors. Then I went into
my office and wrote some letters. While
writiug I heard the speaking-tube whistle
from the pressroom below. The sound in
creased in intensity until it began to
frighten me and as it continued to grow
louder I started to find out the cause of
the noise. I opened the door and found
the room full of smoke and rushed out
shouting 'Fire!'
"How this occurred is a mystery to me.
I'm certain that everything was all right
an hour before the fire. We have been
very particular since the la3t fire. We
cleaned up and burned up everything in
the way of reluse paper and the like, and
nothing of a combustible nature was left
in the building. I've no idea where it
came from. There is a furnace in the rear
for burning paper and such stuff as migUt
be dangerous.
"We have not carried enough insurance,
but 1 believe the aggregate amount car
ried is about $20,000. Probably we are
better covered than before. The last time
there was rebuilding nnd complete refit
ting, but now I presume the floors are
safe and the presses not all badly injurpd."

pany, in the basement of the Francis Val
entine <ft Co. building, sustained heavy

main belting was ruined, and the dyna
mos and engines, although securely cov
ered by the rire-patrol men before the
water came down heavily, were supposed
to have been more or less damaged. The
patrol had a pump at work on the base
ment some time previous to the last
stream's removal, and by that means fire
waskeptupin one boiler. The superin
tendent stated that his company would be
ready this morning to supply the print
ing-houses with power as usual, and his
other patrons with light. He estimated
the loss to the company at $2500.
As to the immediate cause of the fire no
positive information could be got, as
nobody could venture a guess about its
origin. But there was no doubt yesterday
about the place where the lire originated.
Those who first saw it agreed that it
started in the basement, and finding its
way into Valentine's pressroom leaped up
the elevator shaft direct to the top floor.
H. Cohn said he saw the flames coming
from below in the rear of the restaurant
Ferguson corroborated this ntatement.
He saw the fire as it burst from the cellar
and through the back windows of Valen
tine's pressrooms. The Call printers tell
the same story.
Negligence on the part of somebody con
nected with the wrecked print shop is be
lieved to be responsible for the tire. This
is the third extensive fire in the same
place, and besides the Fire Department
has responded to various "still" alarms
from the unlucky spot.

It was in that particular place that the
fire started yesterday.
A remarkable incident of the fire was
Frank P. Lippett's experience. Mr. Lip
pett is a lawyer at Petaluma. Three years
ago he was on Montgomery street when
the alarm sounded from box 27. Yester
day he stood within twenty feet of the
same spot when 27 rang out again. He
went to the same corner at which ho stood
.three years ago watching the fire and saw
the same building burn down.
No less a coincidence was the presence
of Georee K. Fitch, the veteran editor, at
yesterday's tire. Taree years ago, on
Christmas day, he went to visit a Â«ick
friend at Berkeley, and on his return was
astonished to find the Bulletin composing
and editorial rooms, now part of The
Call's quarters, badly damaeed by fire
and the rear buildings entirely destroyed.
He was at Berke ley again yesterday and
when he came back printers' row was
again ablaze, just as it was three years
before.
PETER McCABE'S FALL.
The Fireman Dropped Sixty Feet
From the Roof of the Burning
Buildlnsr.
Bhortly before the fire was placed under
control, Peter McCabe, a fiieman in
The Fireman Who Was Injured at Yesterday's Fire.
Engine Company 2, fell from tbe roof of
the three- story building to the sidewalk, a
distance of over thirty feet. The wonder
is that his life was not crushed out of him
the minute he struck the sidewalk ; but be
lived, and tbe doctors at the Receiviug
Hospital â tat.art annaa time after the poor
i
| fellow's arrival there that there was a
chance that he might recover.
Almost as remarkable was the fact that
not a bone was broken. This may In a
measure be accounted for by tbe fact that
:"i'ab.Â» Â»{-t:Â»k on the top of a street l&Bn;<
before tie landed in the street
At the time Commercial street was well
filled with tire wagons and apparatus, and
the sidewalks were covered with people
watching the firemen at work on the
street, ladders and roof.
McCabe was seen to step to tbe edge of
the roof of the three-story building, and a
second later bis feet flew out from the cor
nice and his hands clutched wildly at a
telephone wire. He fell.
A cry of horror went up from the crow
below and many a strong man turne I
aside so as not to witness the frightful fall
A second later there was a loud crash of
glass as the bi^r street lamp was shattered
into a thousand pieces, followed by the
sound of the fireman's body as it struck
on the sidewalk and street, where it lay
apparently lifeless.
A dozen firemen sprang forward, fol
lowed by many citizens who were anxious
to be of service.
Poor McCabe, who is a very large man,
presented & most pitiful sight. Blood
streamed from a dozen cuts on his head
and face, ami his clothes were torn and
cut to tattars. The word passed along
that the fireman was dead. Nevertheless
the inanimate form was hastily placed in
a hack and hurried off to the Keceiving
Hospital.
There, to the surprise of all, McCabe
showed signs of life.
A careful examination showed that none
of the man's bones were broken. This fact
is probably explained in this way: In fall
ing McCabe's body struck on the side of
tbe lamp instead of directly upon it, and
the force of the fall was thus lessened.
Had the body struck six inches farther to
the right it would have been impaled upon
the lamn-nosL
DEATH OF CAPTAIN SWASEY,
PATRIOT AND PIONEER
He Passed Away Unexpectedly From a Stroke of
Heart Disease, With Which Ailment He Had
Been Ten Years a Sufferer.
After his wounds were dressed McCabe
was put in tbe -ward, and in an hour or so
he recovered consciousness and spoke a
few words with friends at tbe bedside.
â¢The doctors say that the extent of the
man's injuries cannot be ascertained until
to-day. It is feared that he was injured
internally. At any rate it was a miracu
lous escape from death.
From Daniel McKenzie, foreman of en
gine 2, an account of how the accident
happened was given. He said:
"McCabe and several cf our company
were on the roof, an^l we wanted one of
the small lines of hose passed up the lad
der. I toid Pete to go to tbe edge of the
roof and lend a hand in passing up the
line. When he stepped upon the cornice
his feet struck an electric light or tele
phone wire and tripped him up. His feet
shot out and down the poor fellow went
I hope that be will live. He was one of
the best firemen and he never shirked his
duty. Even in tbe big sulphur fires we
have had Pete would stay and fight fire
when all others would leave. He did not
know what it was to be afraid."
McCabe has been in the Fire Depart
ment abont two years. He was one of the
new men in 29 when that company was
organized. For the last year McCabe has
been with 2on Bush street near Kearny.
His only relative is a crippled brother
named John, whom he supported.
McCabe was removed from the Receiv
ing Hospital to the German Hospital late
in the afternoon by his fellow-firemen.
He was conscious and appeared to be hold
ing up even better than was expected.
Flre Breaks Out Again.
At 6 o'clock there was an explosion ol
gasoline or benzine in the rear of the Val
entine Company's pressroom. A large
quantity of the dangerous material was
stored there for cleaning presses and type.
Tbe explosion lighted up the whole place
and it seemed that a bigger fire was
coming, wben an alarm was given from
box 76 â that popular Christmas box. A

"GOD BLESS THE GOVERNOR."
Gratitude of a Man Who Was Pardoned
After Being Wrongfully Imprisoned
for Sixteen Years.
LEAVENWORTH, Kans., Dec. 25.â
Governor Morrill issued a pardon for W.
J. Jackson, which was handed the latter
this morning.
"God bless the Governor," was all Jack
son could fay at first, but presently he ex
pressed a wish to rejoin his wife and chil
dren in Texas as soon as practicable. Ac
cordingly he was dressed in citizen's
clothes, shook hands with Warden Lynch
and others in the Warden's office and
without a backward glance walked out of
the prison in which he was wrongfully
confined for sixteen years. His earnings
during that time, which amounted to $193,
were oven to him and he bought a ticket
to Nockenat, Tex., where he will arrive for
a family reunion Sunday.
Jackson was charged with a marder
committed near Wellington, Kans., in
1873, but was not convicted till 1880. He was
a Texan, but herded cattle in Kansas.
His was a death sentence, which in this
State, as is well known, amounts to life
imprisonment He claims that J. J.
Eikins, who died three years age, left a
confession of the murder, but that it was
not in form to do tbe prisoner any good.
Jackson has a wife and tive children, the
eldest of whom was 9 years old when last
seen by the father, and will, therefore, be
25 at tbeir next meeting. The "baby"
was 2 and is i.ow 18. Mrs. Jackson has
educated tbe children on the proceeds of a
40-acre cotton plantation and has been un
remitting in her efforts to secure her hus
band's pardon, her belief in his innocence
beinz still unshaken.

AND ACTIVITY.
Tbe Adventurous and Highly
Romantic Career of the

WAS ONCE CAPTURED BY
INDIANS.
He Assisted at the Raising of the
American Flag at Monterey
by Commodore Sloat.
Captain William F. Swasey, one of the
most noted of the older pioneers, a man
full of erudition concerning tbe argonauts
of '49, died suddenly of heart disease at
the Hillsdale House, 33 Sixth street, last
night
He had been a sufferer from heart disease
for ten years and had lately been attended
by Dr. C. J. Patton, who informed him
last week that he had not long to live.
The captain complained of pains in his
chest late yesterday afternoon, and be
fore the landlord couid get a physician
the old pioneer was dead.
The first persons on the scene were Drs.
Patton and Krotosyner, both o! whom at
once pronounced tbe cause of death heart
disease. Tne Coroner's deputies investi
gated the case and at once conenrred in
tbe verdict and left the body at tbe hotel.
Officers eJf the Pioneer Society consulted
Mrs. Swasey and her sons without delay
and proposed to take charge of the fu
neral. The Dody was removed to the
California undertaking parlors and ar-
rangements for the luneral will be per
fected to-day.
Captain Swasey had an eventful career.
Leaving his home in Maine when a youth
of 16 he started for tbe West. At Cincin
nati he met a family friend, who, evi
dently captivated by his independence
and pluck, furnished him with some capi
tal. With this, in the course of two
months, he had established a flourishing
business in the provision line.
Next he formed a partnership and en
gaged in the fur business, having his
headquarters in St. Liouis. Things were
going on swimmingly when, through the
dishonesty of his partner, tbe young fur
trader found himself deprived of his sav
ings and almost destitute.
His next venture was to join a party of
trappers bound for Fort Laramie. Ar
rived there, he joined forces with a
French-Canadian named Chaumie, and
together they set out on a trapping expe
dition. They were captured by a band of
Arapahoes, who tortured Chaumie and
burned him at the stake.
The daughter of the chief fell in love
with young Swasey and induced her
father to save bis life. The prisoner was
placed in the front row and saw hit friend
tortured and burned. When the fagots
were lighted at the feet of the unfortunate
trapper Swasey ran forward to save his
friend, but the Indians held him back and

compelled him to be a witness of the tor
ture to the end.
He remained with the Indians for about
eight months, and, wearying of uncivil
ized life, made his escape, after walking
and running alternately for forty-eight
hours. A party of hunters met him on
the third day and they returned with him
to Laramie.
The June following he started with a
party overland for California, and on the
25th of September, 1845, reached Butter's
Fort. While there be acted as secretary
for Captain Sutter. That winter be came
on to Yerba Buena (San Francisco), and
in tbe spring went to Monterey. There
he was appointed secretary to United
States Cousul Thomas O. Larkin, with
whom he remained until after the Ameri
can flag was raised and the territory taken
possession of by Commodore Sloat. In
October he joined Fremont's battalion as
assistant commissary, and at the termina
tion of the campaign was appointed Mar
shal of tbe Territory.
In June, 1848. the captain established
the first store in Napa City and was always
proud to call himself the founder of tbat
city.
He entered the military service of the
United States in 1861 as regimental quar
termaster of the Second California In
fantry, and in November, 1862, was pro
moted by President Lincoln to be captain
and assistant quartermaster of United
States Volunteers. In 1866, some time
after tbe close of tbe war, he was honor
ably mustered out of the service.
"While in the army," said Captain
Swasey in speaking of the events of that
time, "my real estate appreciated very
materially in value, and wbea 1 returned
to civil life I found myself a comparatively
wealthy man. But my ingenuity in de
vising unfortuitous sch mes and specula
tions in stocks and otherwise amounted
almost to genius, and proved amply suffi
cient to dissipate my worldly possessions
in a very few years, since which time I
have been constantly relying upon my
own resources, and sitting in committee
of the whole, so to speak, on ways and
means, always reporting slow progress
and asking further time."
Although old in years Captain Swasey
was the most youthful in appearance of
any of the pioneer band. Besides being
the last surviving member of Fremont's
staff, he was, wish the exception of W. P.
Toler, probably the only member of that
gallant band who assisted at the raising of
the stars and stripes at Monterey in 1846.
The captain wrote a most entertaing vol
ume of his recollections of the days of the
conquest.
Captain Swasey was a man of consider
able reputation as an orator and writer.
He wrote more about old pioneers than
any man in the State, and was considered
the historian of the Pioneer Society. He
was an encyclopedia of information on
subjects connected with early California
history, and many books and newspapers
contain special articles of marked ability
written by him.
A striking example of his style may be
seen in his famous tribute to the Ameri
can flag, delivered at P. y mouth Square on
July 9 last, on the occasion of the raising
of the American flag. As he had helped
to raise the flag in the old days, the sight
of the crowd seemed to inspire him to
new endeavors, and aa the American flag
waved before him above the veranda he
rose, and in tones that trembled with emo
tion, said:
"Old comrades and fellow-citizens: I
am tbe only living man who was con
nected with the State Government when
Sloat and Montgomery raised the flag.
I was Larkin's secretary at the time.
We were all waiting intensely, and when
the emblem of liberty was raised an invo
cation went forth from every heart.
Never until then had we truly felt tbe
power of that piece of bunting that repre
sents what all Americans love. (Cheers.)
Never until then did we feel to its fullest
extent the flag's permeating and protect
ing power."
Then he turned to. the great flag waving
outside the veranda and said :
"Yon waving bunting, behold it in glory
there 1 Beautiful flag of my country, em
blem of protection and safety to the whole
world's down-trodden humanity! Taoa
art the beacon light of hope, of succor ana
of safety to all of God's liberty-loving
creatures! The eyes of the oppressed and
down-trodd n in all tbe earth's re
motest regions brighten and sparkle
with joy when they gaze upon
tby rainbow -hued loveliness. Born
amid tbe strife and storms of all
the elements that war against lib
erty, consecrated in the blood of pa
triots, the most honored and revered
known to the world's history, what hand
shall dare, what heart shall conceive the
damning infamy of lessening the brill
iancy of a single stripe or tbe clouding of
the luster of a single star? To us that
flag symbolizes so much of hope, of hap
piness and of safety that our hearts
cleave to it with a love surpassing that of
man for woman, of mother for child.
May it wave forever in majesty and in
glory undimmedl"
Many similar ex mplesof the old pio
neer's style abound throughout various
issues of San Francisco newspapers for
many years past.
Brazil Benounees the Claim
NEW YORK, Dec. 25.â The Herald's
special cable from Buenos Ayres says:
Rio Janeiro advices state that it is offici
ally announced by the Government that
the claim of Brazil to all territory in
Guiana is renounced. The contention of
the Government was that the territory
claimed by both Great Britain and Vene
zuela was within the boundaries of Brazil
â¢ and belonged to that republic.
Tbe Brazilian administration declared
recently that it was in possession of docu
ments which prove indisputably that the
contested region in Guiana properly came
within the jurisdiction of Brazil.

With Turkey and Paid Eig Prices
to S?e a Very Short Fght.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec 25.â 1t took
Peter Maher just one minute and a half
in the first round to send O'Donnell of
Australia down and out thiÃ afternoon at
the Greater New York Athletic Club at
Coney Island, formerly ttie Seaside Ath
letic Club. The men were matched to go
twemy rounds or more, watch practically
meant a finish fight, but toatier saved the
management from infringing on the Hor
ton law by giving the Austra'ian his qu>
etus with three left-hand punches. Ma
her also sent a right-hander to tbe head,
but it was too high to do any damage.
O'Donnell's solitary contribution was a
very short left which opened the battle
and barely grazed Peter's breast. The
last time the pair met, in the Empire
Athletic Club at Maspeih, Long Island,
Peter sent his man to sleep with three
puncnes in one minute and three seconds.
This afternoon O'Donnell was just as
nervous and ill at ease as at Maspetn and
showed plainly that he was alraid of the
Irishman. Tne Australian displayed un
mistakable nervousness when sitting in
his chair during the preliminary arrange
ments of trying on gloves, etc Maher, on
the contrary, seemed full of confidence
and looked in splendid condition. The
betting was not very lively. Big odds
were offered on Maher, but there were few
who were wilhng to bet on the Australian.
At 2 p. m., the hour set for the prelimi
nary bout, there were not more than 600
people in the building, and it looked
as though the frost, outside was to
be empnasized by another "frost" of a
different nature inside. However, tbe
beautiful clear weather probably induced
many to hurry through the Christmas
turkey and take the journey to the island,
so that when the big fellows shook hands
at 3:37 there were fuliy 3500 present. After
Alec Brown of Brooklyn and San Suter
of tbe same place had been announced as
the official referee and timekeeper respect
ively, tbe opening pair were put on. They
were Fred Wright of Peabody, Mass., and
Jerry Sullivan of Brooklyn, who boxed
ten ruunds at 120 pounds. Wright was
substituted for Eiwood McGlosky of Phila
delphia, as the latter wa* overweigut. The
Peabody boy displayed unusual clever
ness, and after the fifth round had all the
best of the battle. The referee declared
Wright the winner.
Although the principals in the main
event lost no time in getting into the ring,
there was some delay before they shook
hands, as O'Donnell's seconds insisted on
having one of the windows, through which
the sun was streaming on their corner,
darkened, and theu thenrst set of gloves was
found to be too small for the Australian,
and ttiey bad to be changed. O'Donneli
was looked after by Billy Madden, Sam
Fitzpatrick and Mike Butler. Maher's
aids were Jonn J. Qjinn, Peter Low ery
and Pete Burns. After allthe prelimina
ries wÂ« re satisfactorily adjusted, Time
keeper Suter gave the signal at 3:37 o'clock.
Bound Iâ The men spanned for about five
seconds. Ma tier's lace wore a confident ex
pression, while O'Donnell appeared nervous
and shiited uneasily on his leet. The Aus
tralian thought be saw an opening; ho shot
out bis left in a half-hearted manner and just
r-acned Maner's breast. Maher swung his left
to the head and they altnched. Wiule they
were locked together they exchanged lefts at
close quarters and Maher shoved his right up
under O'Donnell's arm, but the blows were
harmless. The reieree broke then:, and then
Maher shot his right to tbe top of O'Donuel.'s
head. The Australian looked astouished and
dropped his guard. The Iribhman came in
like a tiger and sent his left hand on the jaw.
Ti.e Australian stayed down about four sec
onds. When he got ou his feet Maher came at
him again and with a left-hander tbat was a
combination of hook and swing caugut the un
fortunate Australian on the left cheek just
under the eye. O'Donnell went to the floor
with a bang, turned over on his back and was
counted out. His seconds he:peu him to his
corner and he walked out of the ring all right
after a few seconds. When Maher landed the
final blow he did not wait to teÂ« what O'Don
nell would do, but went quietly to bis corner.
Then he went over and snook hands heartily
with Billy Madden.
11,I 1 , was announced that a challenge had
been sent on behalf of Maher to Tom
Sbarkey to fight in tbe Grea.er New York
Athletic Club, and al*o that if Maher was
successful in that contest he would chal
lenge the winner of tbe Corbeti-Fitzsim
moDS fight. The sports filed out through
the enow, loudly bewailing expenditures
varying from $2 to $6 for a minute and a
half's "sport."

here this afternoon with tbe team of the
Los Angeles Athletic Club, by a score of
14 to 0. Berkeley scored ten in the first
half and four in the second. The local
team put up a strong game, but its defeat
is attributed to the superior weight of its
opponents and its own lack of training.

GOTHAM'S EARLY
CHRISTMAS FIRE
Property Worth a Million
Dollars Very Quickly
Destroyed.
Polyclinic Hospital and Sohmer's
Piano Factory Reduced
to Ashes.
One Hundred People Also Made Home.
less by the Burning cf Tenc
ment Property.
NEW YORK, N. ST., Dec. 24.â An early
Christmas morning fire on East Thirty
third street destroyed property valued at
nearly a million dollars and rendered 100
people homeless.
Four buildings, including Sohmer's
piano warehouse and the New York Poly
clinic Hospital, were destroyed. The de
stroyed buildings also include a large five
story brick tenement at 209 East Thirty
third street and a large nve-story brick
factory building. '
The piano warehouse occupied a fourth
of the block and tbe Polyclinic Hospital
was a four-story building with a front of
fifty feet on East Thirty-third street. The
fire began at 7:05 o'clock on the second
floor of Pinare'B snuS factory at 221 East
Thirty- fourth street When the fire en
gines arrived at the scene the fire had al
ready communicated with the piano
factory adjoining on the east. Several
large streams of water were poured on the
burning building, but without apparent
effect, and third and fourth alarms for
engines were sent in. The police, under
Sergeant Fagan, aroused the sleepine
tenants of the building on the west cf the
burning factory.
There was a panic when tbe tenants
found smoke pouring into their rooms,
and in the extreme demoralization which
followed several of the tenants escaped
narrowly with their lives^
With the aid of the police eighteen fami
lies, consisting of seventy-five people, were
dragged and carried from the building.
Sturdy policemen, carrying small chil
dren in their arras, were cheered by the
large crowd as they brought them down
the stairs and out on tbe street. Several
girls, only partly dressed, opened the win
dows of their rooms on the fifth floor and
stepped on the fire-escape in front of the
building. One of them was about to jump
to the street, when a policeman who had
entered the room dragged her back and
carried her to the street.
At 8 o'clock the piano warehouse owned
by Sebastian Sohmer was on tire from cel
lar to roof. Fifteen minutes later the roof
fell in. The fire bad by that time assumed
such enormous proportions that the hos
pital in the rear of the warehouse and
fronting on Thirty-fourth street was in
imminent danger. There were fifty-eight
patients in the building, and when they
were advised there was another panic.
Patients whose condition had been very
serious leaped from their beds and ran
toward the stairs. The nurses and em
ployes of the hospital assured them that
there was no danger, and the panic was
temporarily quelled. One by one the pa
tients were carried from the building until
all of them had been removed. Hastily
improvised stretchers bore the patients to
a near-by hotel, where they were placed in
beds. .
John Gill, an attendant in the hospital,
was overcome by the effects of the smoke.
He was carried to the hotel, where he re
covered a short time afterward. The
flames communicated to tbe roof of the
hospital at 8:30, and in several minutes
the upper floor was belching forth huge
waves of smoke and fire. The firemen
who were inside tbe building were or
dered to leave the structure, and several
lines of hose poured water on it from tbe
elevated railroad tracks on Thirty- fourth
street. The tenement-house at 209, from
which the tenants had been rescued by
the policemen, had been considered sa:e
by tbe firemen until 8:30, when a strong
wind blew the flames over it. In a short
time tbe roof caught the heat of tbe
factory fire and ten minutes afterward the
interior was ablaze. Several streams of
water bad no apparent effect, and in a
sbort time tbe roof fell in with a deafen
ing roar. The front wall of the fifth floor
taught a short time afterward, and then
tbe firemen turned their attention to the
tenement adjoining west. The roof of the
building at 211 fell in and carried with it
to the ground the four floors. The piano
warehouse wall, which was almost solid
and nearly 200 feet long and 60 feet high,
collapsed shortly afterward.
A part of it fell on the roof of the East
River Hotel at 223 and damaged the
building to a great extent. Tbe firemen
poured several streams of water on the
hotel, but fire started in the rear of the
top floor shortly after the wall fell upon
it. The fire in the factory, warehouse and
tenement was under control at 10 o'clock,
but only after everything in them had
been destroyed. Nothing remained of the
three buildings except parts of the outer
walls and a blazing mass of lumber and
woodwork in the interiors. The building
in which tbe fire started was occupied on
the first, second and third floors by J. F.
Kaldenberg, a manufacturer of pipes and
smokers' material.". The loss is about
$150,000.
Pinare's snuff factory occupied a part of
the second floor and the fourth and fifth
floors of the building. The loss to the
snuff manufacturer will not be less than
$80,000. The loss to the ' building will
amount to nearly $200,000, partly covered
by insurance.
The Sohmer piano warehouse Is a total
loss. The loss to Bon rri r-r in stock and ma
chinery will reach $300,000 or $400,000, and
loss ou building $200,000. The tenement at
209 East Thirty-third street was damaged
to tbe extent of $75,000. The damage done
to furniture and personal property of the
tenants is several thousand dollars.
The damage done to the Polyclinic Hos
pital wiil amount to at least $75,000. There
were thirty children among tne patients
and all of them were carried out in the
arms of firem -n.
The fires in all tbe buildings were under
control at 11 o'clock. Besides rendering
homeless a hundred people, the fire has
thrown out of work nearly 600 employes
of the factories and the hospital.
The New York Polyclinic Hospital is a
private institution. It was organized as
a medical college and hospital about fif
teen years ago. Several persons were
slightly injured during the progress of the
fire.
ST. STEPHEN'S CHURCH BURNED.
Fire Destroys the Most Fashionable Epis
copal Place of Worship in Wiikes
barre, Pennsylvania.
WILKESBARRjfi, Pa., Dec. 25.â St.
Stephen's Church, the most fashionable
Episcopal church in town, situated on
South .Franklin street, was destroyed by
fire early this morning, the fire having
cau-ht from the heating apparatus in the
basement. It must have smoldered all
night, as when discovered the whole in
terior was ablaze. The interior was very
beautiful. The great pipe organ and a
dozen memorial windows and tablets
were also destroyed. Only the silver
communion service was saved. The walls
were left standing. The church was
valued at $90,000 and was four years ago
remodeled a a cost of $20,000. The losÂ« 's
$50,000. There is an insurance of $30,000.
The fire skipped one building and then
caught the building occupied by the West
moreland Club House. Some of the most
expensive furniture was saved, but tbe losa
to building and furniture will be $20,000.

FIRE BAG ES IN A MINE.
Jt Promises to Cause a Heavy Los* and
Throw Many Out of Work.
HALIFAX, N. P., Dec. 25.â A report
has been received here to-nierht tbat a
serious fire is raging in the Big Spring
Hill coal mine in Cumberland County.
Tbe fire broke out during the day and
despite the efforts made to extinguish it
the flames succeeded in getting beyond
the control of the men fighting to subdue
them.
The fire started in the east slope. The
miners are working desperately to keep
the flames from spreading farther.
The nortn slope is not in imminent dan
ger. The fire originated in an 1800-foot
level and was caused by a pipeway carry
ing steam into tbe mine to operate the
machinery becoming overheated. Alarge
number of men were at work at the time.
At the first indication of danger they
made a rush to escape and all reached the
surface safely. The flames spread quickly
to the 1300-foot level, which is now con
verted into a raging furnace, the flames
issuing from every opening to the slope.
Efforts were made to prevent the air
from entering the mine, every opening
being closed, but so far this has been in
effectual in staying tbe fury oi the fire. It
was feared that an explosion would occur,
but so far there has been none.
The disaster will be a terrible one to
Spring Hill, a place of 6000 people, sup
ported wholly by the men working in the
mines, which are owned by the Cumber
land Coal and Railway Company. The
total loss from the fire cannot be estimated
at present, but it will reach very high
figures.
The Spring Hill mines have been the
scene of several calamities, the most
serious being that of February, 1891, when
nearly 120 men ana boys were killed by an
explosion.

But Upon the Subject of Hawaiian
Annexation the Ex-Queen Re
mains Silent.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 25.âLiliuoka
lani, ex-Queen of tbe Hawaiian Islands,
arrived in Jersey City from the South at
1:55 this afternoon. A crowd of curious
persons were at the station to meet her
and when her private car came to a stop
in the Pennsylvania railroad station, they
gathered ciose around it in order to catch
a glimpse of the deposed Queen.
After a brief interval t"e ex-Queen ap
peared on the platform of the car and ad
dressing tuose present, said: "I certainly
have received a royal reception. Ameri
cans are most cordial asu race."
Later, in conversation with a reoresen
tative of the United Associated Presses,
she said tbat she was not here on any po
litical errand and that her visit was
purely a friendiy one. She further said
that she did not know whether she would
later go to Washington or not, as her
plans are not arranged for more than a
month.
M I will go to Boston," the ex-Queen
added, "to visit a cousin of tne uncle of
my late husband. I will stay with the
Lees for four weeks at least, and then I
shall go wherever my fancy dictates,"
"What about the annexation of Ha
waii?" was asked.
At this point the ex-Queen seemed to
forget her fluent English and feigned not
to understand. When the question was
put again she was equally dense, and it
was evident the annexation question was
not to be discussed by the ex-Q leen.
Tbe interview over, the ex-Queen, her
traveling companion, Mrs. F. H. Maneo
lena, and the private secretary, Joseph
Holhule, escorted by the passenger agent
of the Southern Railway, boarded the

Mr. Townsend was born in this city in
1833. He has been well known as a per
sistent fighter and reformer. The first in
stance in whicii he gained fame was tbe
case of Judge Cardoza, a member of the
Tweed ring, who had sent two women to
tbe Tombs for contempt. He took up the
case as a matter of justice, but was told by
Judge Cardoza that if he continued it he
need ask for no favors. Mr. Townsend
did continue and fought tbe matter to a
very bitter end. It resulted in tha im
peachment of Cardoza, a Supreme Court
Judge, Police Court Judge Dowiing and
Judges Barnard and McOune. Cardoza
resigned. Dowiing also resigned ; but
Barnard and McCune were con
victed. Seven other police justices were
driven from the bench. All bad opposed
him by methods which he exposed, his
victory resulting in the purification of the
bench.
Mr. Townsend leaves a widow and three
daughters, bis unmarried daughter, Mar
garet, was with him at his death. Tbe
married daughters are Mrs. Francis Pres
ton Fremont, wife of a son of General
John C. Fremont, and Mrs. Francis Darr
of Morristown, N. J.

Stockholders and Depositor* Desire the
Bank of Minnesota to Resume.
BT. PAUL, Minn., Dec. 25.-John D.
O'Brien, attorney for the Bank of Minne
sota, announces that action will com
mence to-morrow looking to the re
organization of the bank. Both the stock
holders and the depositors are enthu
siastically in favor of putting tbe insti
tution on its feet again, and the depositors
are especially lenient in their demands.
They are willing tbat their money snail
be paid to them in tour payments in six,
twelve, eighteen and twenty- fo r months.
The stockholders will be asked to advance
$600,000. This, with the good loans, will
considerably more than pay every
depositor dollar for dollar. It is now
expected that the receivers can b â  dis
charged and the bank put in the hands oi
its officers again by tne middle of January.
As the Stock Yards bank is a feeder of the
older institution, it will be reorganized
on the same basis.

Federal Authorities Hold
the Three Friends at
Key West.
An Investigation to Be Made of
the Reported Engagement
With Spanish Gunboats.
If the Story Proyes True the Owners
of the Steamer May Bs In*
dieted for Piracy.
NEW YORK. N. V., Dec 25.-A Herald
special from Key West, Fla., says: As
to-day was a National holiday nothing
was done by the local Federal authorities
in the matter of the Cuban filibustering
steamer Three Friends.
For the same reason, it is presumed, no
instructions have been received from
Washington, nor has any intimation been
given of what is proposed to be done with
the steamer or her captain. The tug re
mains tied up at tbe wharf, with a cus
toms officer aboard, and Captain Rey
nolds of the revenue cutter McLane has
been instructed to keep surveillance over
her to prevent any attempt to depart
Considerable interest has been manifested
in the probable action of the Washington
officials in tbe matter, and the outcome is
anxiously awaited.
The report that the tug exchanged shots
with Spanish naval vessels on the Cuban
coast and within the jurisdiction of Cuban
waters is freely discussed in the streets,
and, while* applauded in Cuban circles, is
considered by more sober-minded citizens
as seriously complicating the situation.
It is thought the master and crew may be
indicted for piracy and the vessel con
demned as a pirate.
Captain Lewis was seen this evening.
He insists he has not violated any law
and declares the Turee Friends has been
engaged only in legitimate trade. Cap
4ain O'Brien, who is also attached to the
tug, makes a similar statement.
Consul-General iyse called on Captain
Lewis during his brief visit ashore and
had a long conference with him about the
.reported cruise of the tug. It is not
knowu whether General Lee was acting
under instructions from Washington or
obtaining information for h;s guidance
after reaching Havana. If, as rumored,
an engagement actually took place be
tween the tug and Spanish tugboats, the
matter, it is thought, will be brought to
his attention by the Spanish officials :a
Cuba.
NEW YORK. N. V., Dec. 25.-A Hera;.
special from Washington says: . Official.
of the Treasury Department do not kno â¢
officially of the seizure of the ateame?
Three Friends in Key West. It is the iiÂ«
tention of the officials to have a thorough
investigation made into the latest trip c- 1
tbe alleged filibuster. It is probable t bat
the vessel, her officers and crew will bs
proceeded against under tbe laws prohib
iting armed expeditions against a power
with which the United States are at peac .
Tbe officials believe that if the reports of
a conflict with a Spanish coast guard ves
sel can be substantiated in the courts the
vessel will be condemned and her officers
convicted.
Under the law the vessel would be lia
ble to forfeiture, and her officers and
members of her crew would be liable to
tines oi not more than $10,000 each and
imprisonment for not more than three
years. Tnere has never been any question
as to such acts as are alleged to have been
tmmitted by the Three Friends being
violations of the neutrality laws.
It is not expected that the incident will
lead' to any serious complications between
the United States and Spain. The Span
ish Government will expect this Govern
ment to enforce the law against the ves-ei
and her owners and crew if they have been
guilty of violating its provisions. This is
all that could be expected, unless it could
be proved that this Government had not
exercised due diligence in attempting to
prevent the departure of the expedition.
In that case the United States might be
liable to claims for heavy damages.
KEY WEST, Fla.. Dec. 25.â General
Lee passed through thi3 city to-night, en
route to Havana.
WAS SIMPLY A MASSACRE.
But the Spanish Troops Upturned With a
Report of " Victory."
HAVANA, Cuba, Dec. 25.â An official
announcement was made today that the
Spanish troops under Colonel Ratsanal
have had an engagement with several
â¢j#bel parties under Rojas. The scene of
the fighting was near Cimarrones, prov
ince of JP uerto Principe. A rebel camp
was captured and the insurgents were
completely dispersed, with the loss of
thirty-six killed. The Spanish loss was
one kil;eu and eight wounded.
Advices from a more reliable source
than the Government show that the so
called engagement was sinipiy a massacre
of unarmed Cubans by the troops. While
1 the train was patting along the railway
between Cailsaireu and Camagauama,
province of Santa Clara, a dynamite bomb
exploded, wrecking the armored car con
taining the train's military escort. Two
aaldiera were killed and two wounded.

special from Key West says: Passengers
from Havana last night report that an
other attack was made Wednesday night
upon Regia, almost under the guns of the
fortress. This and other fights near there
greatly alarmed the people of Havana.
The troop of the night watch has been

CECIL RHODES IS SARCASTIC.
While En Route to England to Tell What
He Knows About Jameson's Raid
Hs Speaks at a Banquet
CAPE TOWN, South Africa, Dec. 25.â
A reception was given to-day at Port
Elizabeth to Cecil Rhodes, formerly
Prime Minister of Cape Colony and man
ager ot the British South Africa Com
pany, who is en route to England to tes
tily before the commission that will ex
amine into the raid of Dr. Jameson into
the Transvaal. Mr. Rhodes made a
speech, certain parts of which have ex
cited considerable comment here. He
treated lengthily upon South African
affairs, touching somewhat fully upon
affairs in Rhodesia, where he arrived a
few days ago, after taking part in the sup
pression of the Matabele revolt, and then
saia that he was going home to be exam
ined regarding the Jameson exped;; OB
by his fellow-countrymen, whose an u
ous rectitude he well knew. This sa: as
tic reference to the investigating coin is
sion is taken to indicate that Mr. Ebu< el*
testimony will be far more hue re; ng
than was anticipated. '
In another speech at Port Elizabeth A! tÂ»
Rhodes, who, it will be recalled, seme
years ago contributed $50,000 to the Irish
cause, said that in tbe course of his nego
tiations with Charles Stewart Parnell the
latter promised to insert in the home rule
bill a clause allowing permissive represen
tation of the colonies in the British Par
liament.

A CITY BUILT ON SAND
Twenty Acres of Broken Bottles Mark
the Site of Ainsworth.
There were towns of the mushroom va
riety in the old mining days. One day a
party of surveyors made camp on a sand
flat by the side of the turbulent Snake
Riverâ the Kimooenum of the Nez Perces,
the Lewis River of Lewis and Clarkeâ
where it pours its yellow-gray mud
stained flood into the clear water of the
Columbia. There was little scenery in
the landscape and iess vegetation on the
soil. Sagebrush and cactus were the
flora; horned toads, badgers, rattlesnakes
and prairie owls the fauna of the land.
It had neither beauty nor utility to rec
ommend it, and there were no yellow
grains in its sandbanks for attractions.
But there must be a railroad, and there
must be a way of crossing that half mile
o: muddy, rolling water.
It was not a boy's job, for at its lowest
flow it was a powerful river, and when the
snows of the great peak^ of the Salmon
River and KocKy mountains were melt
ing under a June bun a current sixty feet
deep rushed down over its rocky bottom
in dark swirls. There must be more than
a million dollars sunk in tbe stream before
a car could pass over tbe bridge. On the

THE SWIFT FILIBUSTER STEAMER THREE FRIENDS.
In carrying men and arms to the Cuban insurgents this vessel has eluded the revenue cutters of the United States
and Spanish warships on several occasions. Most daring of all exploits is the reported battle with two Spanish gunboats
off the coast of Cuba, in which the blockade-runner is said to have come out victorious. Upon the return of the Three
Friends to Key West Christmas eve, however. Captain Lewis, her commander, denied the lurid story of the alleged
battle, and said he had simply been on a trading expedition.
sand of that desert rose a city. In less
than two years there was a municipal cor
poration on that sandbank that num
bered in its limits 2000 inhabitants. It
was not a city set upon a hill, but it was
not one of the quiet, retiring kind that
hide their own light.
There were good times in the city of
Ainswortn. The granite for the great
piers of the bridge was quarried on the
river above and rafted iiown. Tne lowest
wage was $2 50 per day, and the pay
ranged upward from that Every one
had money and spent it. The general
merchandise business was not extensive,
and the company store enjoyed a practical
monopoly. Ainsworth was not the center
of a great trade, as was Uraatilla in its
prosperous days, but what fell short in the
more tubstantial things amended in re
freshments. Sixteen saloons flourished
and dispensed whisky cocktails to its mot
ley Dopulation. The inference of a casual
observer is that the nature of the country
was to blame for this unequal condition
of affairs regarding liquids and more solid
articles. P> rhaps the residents noted that
Snake River rolled millions of tons of good
water down toward the sea, while at a dis
tance of ten feet from the shore the land
was parched and burning the whole year
round. Reasoning <rom this that water
was out of place there they swore off using
it as a beverage, and, what was remark
able about swearing off, they almost uni
versally stuck to it.
One day the bridge was completed.
It stretched 1541 feet over the stream, with
a 340-foot draw. April 15, 1884, it was com
pleted, and the old ferry-Ooat Billings,
that had carried the cars across the river
so long, was "out of a job." It had been
over two years building.
When the bridge was completed the in
habitants began to move away. Some
took their bouses down and away.
Others left them for the rest to take down,
which tbe remaining population promptly
did for firewood. So many went that
there were not enough left to rill the offices
of the corporation, and so the place was
disincorporated. Whal is more remark
able, all the debts were paid. There was
no repudiation. The dissolution was ac
complished and left no liabilities. The
remaining asset was a silver watch, and it
was presented to the Mayor without a
dissenting vote.
So departed the city of Ainsworth. It
was a city built upon sand and could not
stand. It did not wasli away, but it might
as w 11 have done so. It has as com
pletely disappeared as though it had.
To-day twenty acres of broken bottles
mark the site. .From the number it would
seem they had taken many a bumper
to the success of the enterpriseâ a per
manent record that lived up to the vow to
abstain from water. â Seattle Post-intelli

DOUGLAS AND THE LANDLADY.
How the Little Giant Posed as a Sov
ereign.
To-day Knox College is celebrating with
flags and crowds and oratory the thirty
eighth anniversary of the joint debate be
tween Lincoln and Douglas. Stimulated
by thp preparations for this festival,
Judge X., a friend and follower of Doug
las, was moved to tell the following story
about him :
"I shall never forget sitting up all night
at that cottage in the grove where Doug
las lived, and near tbe site of which now
rises his monument. He had just re
turned from iss foreign tour, and for
hours he told of his adventures.
"One story of a London landlady
amused him especially. Her hotel had
been recommended to him for comfort
and qu et, so he went there, travel-stained
and unattended, ordering his baggage to
follow.
'The landlady, a barrel-shaped and
rigid-minded English woman, took his
measure and showed him rather meager
rooms. 'Have you anything bettor,
madam?' he asked. The next were but
little better, and the next. At last Doug
las demanded the best she had, and the
woman confessed to certain rooms on the
first floor which were usually occupied
by members of the no-bility. Reluctantly
she led her questionable guest to a cheer
ful suite overlooking parks and gardens,
and there Douglas installed himself and
sat down to wiite and smoke.
"Soon a lackey observing him from the
hall entered to tell him that smoking was
not permitted in these apartments. The
Senator, detecting impertinence in the
man's manner, smoked on. Another
came, and still he smoked. Then a man
in a tall coat and white gloves entered
and was very peremptory. Douglass
looked at him and puffed away. Then
the stout little landlady appeared with all
her feathers flying and began to lay down
the law.
"This time Douglas rose and faced the
intruder. Summoning all the grandeur of
manner which had captured audiences and
quelled conventions, he bowed pro oundly
and said, with resonant voice and solemn
pause, 'Madame, perhaps you do not know
who I am?'
"The lady confessed her ignorance.
" 'Madame,' said Douglas â aud no one
could do it better â 'I am an American
sovereign.'
"The round little ludy courtesied and
backed ont of the room. And when Bir
Robert Peel called the next day. and car
riages of lords and notables blocked the
way, she decided that she was harboring
a sovereign, indeed, and that there were
not lackeys enough under her roof to do
him honor."â Chicago Times-Herald. .
EUROPEAN POWERS
GROWING UNEASY
Will Not Remain Impassive
if the Cubans Are
Recognized.
Afraid of Such an Extension oi
International Action by
the United States.
Nations That Fsar the Spirit of Enter
prise and Encroachment May
Affect Their Possessions.
LONDON, Eng., Dec. 25.â The Times
will to-morrow publish a dispatch from
Paris savin? that the United States has
been confidentially informed in the most
friendly terms that the European powers
could not remain impassive in the event
of the United States abandoning the atti
tude of President Cleveland and his Cab
inet. Should the United States presume
to exercise pressure on Spain by recogniz
ing the Cuban insurgents or encouraging
them in their resistance, it has been in
formed that Europe generally might be
come uneasy at the idea of such an ex
tension of international action by the
United (States, inasmuch as it might at a
given moment threaten almost all the
powers whose possessions are in proximity
to the United States and might tempt the
spirit of enterprise and encroachment that
is inspiring the Senate Committee on
Foreign Relations.
"If," continues the writer, "I am con
rectly informed, the United States has
been concurrently informed that Ger
many is already quite prepared to side with
Spain in the event of the United States
showing that she is disposed officially to
side with the rebels. Moreover, academic
conversations are proceeding in certain
foreign offices anent the measures the
powers should take to form a syndicate
against the invasion of socialism which is
now menacing all political organizations.
"It was during these parleys that the
friendly warning to the United States
originated, Senator Cameron's resolutions
for the recognition of the Cuban insur
gents being regarded in some quarters as
revolutionary."

"I have no doubt that the position of

entirely correct. The question that Gov
ernments shall be recognized in a country
where an attempt at revolution is in prog
ress is certainly for the executive to de
termine, and not for Congress. No legisla
tion by that body can under any constitu
tion decide it. Tbe Congressmen can, of
course, pass resolutions upon the subject
if they release. But they in no respect
control the discretion of the President.
"Besides, no government can be recog
nized until it exists. The government re
cognized by other governments waen a
dispute in regard to it exists is always the
de facto government. The recognition by
other nations of a government once in ex
istence must always continue until it is
actually subverted and a new one put in
its place. When it is overthrown and an*
other established that becomes entitled to
recognition.
"The rebels in Cuba have no organized
government and not even an abiding
place which they can call their own. They
are merely a guerrilla force which would
be speedily annihilated if it allowed itself
to be drawn into a general engagement
with the much superior Spanish army. It
preserves its existence by its dexterity in
avoiding such an engagement. It would
be absurd to say that such a force con
stitutes a government or that tbe Spanish
government in Cuba has been overthrown
or that any diplomatic relations could ex
ist between the rebels and the Govern
ment of the United States.
"Ii this country interferes by arms in
that contest, it must be by assisting the
rebellion in Cuba to displace the Spanish
Government and to set up another. This
would be a declaration of war against
Spain, a country with which we are and
always have been at peace and from winch
we have received no injury and no provo
cation. It would be a gross and utterly
unjustifiable violation of international
law which no country can afford Kj perpe
trate in the eyes of the world. It would,
in my judgment, be fatal to the restora
tion of business prosperity which is now
our most vital necessity, and which has
been so long postponed that it cannot be
much ionger delayed without the most
serious consequences.
"We cannot afford to go to war with any
country at this time, unless a war should
be forced upon us in self-defense, which
would be a grave calamity, of which there
is happily no danger. We need, above all
things, rest and peace and opportunity to
attend to our own affairs without the
interruption of a constant panic and alarm
set on foot by reckless concessional and
political agitators. The time has come, in
my opinion, when it needs to be deter
mined whether the interests of this
country are to be controlled by the nen
who make its name or by those who do
its work."
MONEY WILL GO TO CUBA.
Determined to Make a Peraonal Jnresti-
tjntinn of the Strife.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 25.â A Sun
special from Washington says: Senator
elect Money of Mississippi, whose term in
the House does not expire until March 4
and who is one of the Democratic members
of the House Foreign Affairs Committee,
has determined to visit Cuba and find out
for himself the true situation of affairs in
the island. According to a letter received
from him yesterday by one of his friends,
he will leave Tampa next Saturday morn
ing for Havana, and calculates to remain
a week or ten days in Cuba, Colonel
Money has provided himself . with all
necessary passports. It is hia purpose to
sees an audience with Captain-General
Weyler as soon as possible after arriving
at Havana.
Colonel Money proposes to request the
captain-geaeral to provide him with an
escort and a flag of truce, so that he can
go into the heart of the territory occupied
by the insurgents, with a view of finding
out what is going on. Colonel Money
says he is determined to make as lengthy
a journey into the interior of Cuba as his
time will permit, and it is understood
that he will also endeavor to communi
cate with the insurgents, whether Captain-
General Weyier grauta his permission or
not. Colonel Money realizes that it will
be a risky thing for him to proceed on his
own account if a permit is refused. How
ever, he is so anxious to get at the truth
that hi will take his chances.
It ii bis intention to state frankly to the
captain-general that he visits the island
because it is impossible to procure from
President Cleveland or Secretary Olney
any official information regarding the con
dition of affairs in Cuba, and as a member
of Congress and of tbe House Committee
on Foreign Affairs, he wishes to know
what he is doing before he casts a vote for
or againsi any one of the several resolu
tions pending.
Colonel Money was an officer in the
Confederate army during the war under
General Forrest, and his service in tbe
field whetted his interest in military op
erations. He thinks his visit will at least
enable him to learn more than he could by
depending on tne Btate Department for
information.

MISTAKEN FOR
A PILOT BOAT
Schooner Carrie Walker
Run Down and Sunk
by a Steamer.
Flare-Up Lights on the Sailing
Vessel Cause a Disastrous
Misunderstanding.
Rules of the Road at Sa Clearly
Violated by the Officers of the
Liner Scandinavian.
BOSTON, Mass., Dec. 25.â The overdue
Allen line steamer Scandinavian from
Glasgow arrived to-day, six days late,
owing to bad weather, poor coal and green
firemen.
On Christmas eve she collided off Cape
Cod with the lumber-laden schooner Carrie
Walker, which vessel became a total
wreck, as the result of the collision, her
crew of six men being brought here on
the steamer. The accident was due to the
steam ? hip captain mistaking the
schooner for the pilot-boat on the Cape
Cod station as she burned flare-up lights
used aboard the pilot fleet as a signal.
Chief Mate Aitken answered what he
thought to be a pilot-boat's signal. The
wind was blowing from the north-north
aest, which being a fair wind for the sail
ing craft, tbe latter commenced to draw
nearer the steamer, and the steamer kept
her course at a moderate rate of speed,
naturally thinking that tbe supposed pilot
boat would come about and launch a boat,
instead of which the schooner crashed
into the steamer with terrific force, strik
ing her on the starboard bow and doing
considerable damage. The schooner's
yawl boat brought the crew to the steamer.
The Scandinavian has two holes in her
starboard bow, one about two fe j t square
just above the load-line, while the other is
on the bluff of the bow, where a large
piece of the schooner's jibboom and a por
tion of her jib had lodged.
The schooner Carrie Walker wag com
manded by Captain Starkey, owned by
Charles W. King of Eastport, Maine, and
left St. Johns, N. 8., December 15, with
laths and shingles for New London, Conn.
Captain Starkey says: "When the col
lision occurred the vessel's bows opened
and filled rapidly with water and st:e
must have capsized, at she was nowhere
to be seen shortly afterward. Flare-up
light was used simply to warn the ap
proaching steamer, which should have
given us the right of way, according to
tbe rules of the road at sea. The crew
had barely time to gather their trunks
and personal effects and stow them aboard
the yawl before leaving the wreck."
SUT DOWN BY A TRAIN.
Wreck of a Trolley-Car Results in the
Killing of the Motorman and the

ALLEN TOWN, Pa., Dec. 25.â A trolley
car coming to this city from Bethlehem
this afternoon was struck by a Jersey
Central passenger train on a grade cross
ing in East Allentown. The trolley-car

train was running twenty-five miles an
hour and when the locomotive structc the

bruised and four passengers from Beth
lehem were injured. John Brink, face
cut; Mrs. John Brink, face bruised; Ed
Werg, thigh and spine hurt; P, Gehman,

LOST ON ELIDA
ISLAND REEFS
The Schooner Sailor Boy-
Dashed Ashore by a
Gale.
Its Crew of Two Men Escape to
Starve on a Barren
Shore.
Human Habitations Reached When
Hunger Has Almost Done
Its Work.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Dec. 25.â Captain
Charles Peterson and William Lindley,
better known as "Crawfish Bill," were
shipwrecked at Eiida Island, 350 miles
south of this port, on November 23, and
after undergoing awful privations and
dangers have returned to this port. They
were brought up from San Quiniin by the
steamer Carlos Pacheco, which arrived
this morning.
Tbe men were guano-satherinc in the
little schooner Sailor Boy at Elida when
they were struck by the gale and wrecked.
Everythine about the schooner was in
ship-shape before the gale sprang up, and
both men were below eating a late supper.
Suddenly, as if a giant had taken hold of
the vessel, the Sailor Boy careened on its
side and beean to pitch and rolL The two
men rushed upon deck, but could do noth
ing to hold the vessel, which was already
dragging its anchor in tbe direction of the
rocks of Elida. Huge waves had begun to
come in while the men were at supper,
and though unnoticed nt the time, were
now seen to be portentous of trouble.
Above the roar of the gale, which made
a loud noise in the rigging, Skipper Peter
sou called Lindley aft and directed him to
launch the small boat, which was done
with difficulty. It was held fast by a
painter, and was hardly clear of the
schooner when the Sailor Boy struck the
rocks with such force that both men were
thrown olf their feet. They endeavored
to get overboard into the small boat, but
the violent jumping and thumping of the
schooner prevented them from getting
into the smaller craft without a drench
ing. Skipper Peterson could hear the
timbers creak and break under the terri
ble pounding, and finally the vessel filled
and settled down among the pointed
rocks. Tbe wind and waves continued
their work of destruction until the
echooner was in pieces.
The men had in the meantime cut loose
the small boat and with great danger to
themselves gained a foothold beyond the
reach of the breakers, wnich rushed with
fury over the rocks and into tbe little
coves of the island. They had been un
able to save any provisions or fresh water,
their clothes were soaking wet and the
small boat was badly wrenched.
Notwithstanding their condition, Peter
son and Lindley launched their skiff as
soon as the gale abated and undertook the
perilous trip across thenfcrrow channel
separating Elida Island from the main
land. They were fortunate in getting
through the surf and across. There, after
another battle with the breakers, they
landed. After hauling their boat up out
of reach of the sea they walked inland
several miles to the Higgins ranch at
Rosarita. There they were supplied with
a email quantity of provisions, which they
ate with avidity, as they had been with
out food for two days, and the next morn
ing tbe mariners set oat on foot for
Rosario, a distance of 200 miles north,
with no ranches or habitations interven
ing.
Skipper Peterson and his companion be
lieved that the worst of their experience
had been passed through, but they soon
changed their minds. Unused to tramp
ing over a rough country, and with scant
knowledge of the places where water
conld be obtained, they soon wore them
selves out and suffered terribly. The rocks
cut their shoes to pieces and the thick
brush they passed through made rags of
their clothes.
Occasionally to quench their thirst as
well as to gain a respite from the pangs of
hanger the men plucked and ate tunas,
tbe fruit of tlie cactus, and their mouths
were made sore by the tiny prickers cov
ering the fruit. Both men were fast los
ing strength and were almost Hopeless,
but they encouraged one another almost
constantly and kept on.
A chart that Peterson carried in his
pocket was probably the only thing that
saved them from becoming lost. By its
aid they were enabled to follow the trails
np hill and down and across the canyons.
A sweep of the sea was frequently in view,
but no schooner or other vessel app ared
sufficiently near to be hailed. The hard
ships of the days and the cold nights
made them miserable, and hunger and
thirst haunted them relentlessly.
Finally the two men reached Rosario,
thirty-live miles south of San Quintin, and
there obtained food and ample accommo
dations. A day or two later they were
taken to San Quintin in time to catch the
steamer Pacheco lor San Diego. X
Just a year ago Skipper Peterson, then a
sailor on the Pacheco, attempted with
three other sailors to effect a landing
through the heavy surf at San Antonio
Landing, and was the only one of the four
who escaped with his life.

character. In the evening a cantata was

fessor and Mrs. E. A. Smith, with a male
quartet and orchestral accompaniment.

TRAGEDY AT STOCKTON.
William Winter, an A tamed a Steamboat
Engineer, Cuts His Throat and
Will Die.
STOCKTON, Cal., Dec. 25.â William
Winter, a steamboat engineer who lives at
2315 San Jose avenue, in Alaraeda, at
tempted to kill himself in the Del Monte
lodging house in this city by cutting his
throat, to-night. He succeeded in making
an ugly gash, severing the windpipe, and
there is little hope of his recovery.
Wintei came to Stockton eight days ago
and started on a a debauch. He had con
siderable money when he arrived, but it
was gradually taken from him and only a
few days ago he had to part with his watch.
Since then he his been confined to his
room. To-night the barkeeper of the Del
Monte saloon heard heavy breathing in
Winter's room and iound the door was
locked on the inside. He summoned as
sistance and forced the door. By tbat
time Vv inter was nearly dead from loss of
blood and the police patrol was sum
mooed.
Officer Walker found that Winter had
cut his throat from ear to ear with his
pocket knife, severing the windpipe. Had
not the barkeeper forced nis way into the
room Winter woald have bled to death.
He was taken to the Receiving Hospita
and the gash in his throat was closed. In
his pockets were found a number of letters
that show that Winter was engaged as a
steamboat engineer on the Gulf of Mexico,
he having several high testimonials from
former employers.
VIOLATED ALASKA'S LAW.
First Conviction for Selling WhisHy in.
the Territory.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., Dec. 25.-
For the first time in the history of
Alaska has a conviction been rendered
against a saloon-keeper for selling
whisky. Max Endleraan, formerly
deputy United States Marshal, was in
dicted, together with a score of others.
The trial jury disagreed and was roundly
scored by Judge Delaney. He immediately
called another panel and assisted in the
introduction of testimony and the ex
amination of witnesses and then de
livered a charge which admitted of but
one verdict, t.iat of guilty, which was re
turned. Anne of $50 was imposed. The
court added that future convciions would
be punished by tbe maximum penalty of
law. He warned suborditHte court
official that he would hold them to a
strict accounting for the rigid enforce
ment of the laws and particularly tbe
enforcement of the statute regarding sale
of intoxicants in Alaska.

LOS ANGELES, Cal., Dec. 25.â D. C.
Uarriclow, Â» telegraph operator from Cof
fejville, Kansas, took morphine to-nieht

I etween tte Woman and an
Inheritance.
PORTLAND, Ob., Dec. 25.â Miss Mary
Ellen Thaxter of Sedalia, Mo., is here en
deavoring to obtain confirmatory evidence
of tbe death of her father, Everett Thax
ter â if he be indeed dead â to expedite the
distribution of a half-million dollar estate
in St. Louis, in which she is interested to
the extent of $250,000.
Ten years ago Mr. Thaxter left his home,
coming West, and the last few letters Miss
Thaxter received from him were post
marked "Oswego, Or." That was about five
or six years ago. Then correspondence
between father and daughter ceased.
About that time Thfxter was known to
live in the neighborhood of Oswego, pros
pecting and otherwise laboring, having as
a chum one Frank Merrick. In the fall
of 1892, Merrick circulated the story that
his partner had gone back to his home in
Missouri. This was credited up to tliree
months ago, despite the fact tbat Thax
ter's few acquaintances never again heard
of him.
A year thereafter a well near Oswego
was being drained and cleaned, when the
workmen found a man's skeleton at the
bottom of it. This discovery not only
was the sensation of the hour, but proved
very mystifying, as no person who sud
denly disappeared from that locality was
then unaccounted for. The skeleton was
interred in a pauper's grave, and in a few
days the incident passed from the mind of
man.
Perhaps it never would have recurred
but for an incident dating three months
bactc. At that time a prominent citizen
of Oswego, whose name was presumably
given by the postmaster of the place, re
ceived a letter from Miss Thaxter, inquir
ing for the whereabouts of her father. In
her letter she claimed to have not heard
from him since the early fall of 1892, when
he wrote of bis purpose to return to his
farm the next year, as be failed to meet
with success here. This letter was placed
in the hands of Detective Welsh, an erst
while resident of Osweno.
The officers at once came to the conclu
sion that the skeleton found iv the Os
wego well might have been that of Thax
ter, anJ that it was more than probable
that Merrick could shed some light on the
subject.
Merrick no longer lived in Oswego, and
Detective Welsh met with innumerable
obstacles in trying to locate him. At last
his diligent search was rowarded by in
formation that Merrick was working at
the Cascades. Welsh was congratulating
himself upon the successful issue of his
labors, but on the day he was to letve for
the Cascades the news reached Portland
that Merrick was accidently killed by fall
ing down an incline.
Miss Thaxter purposes returning home
to-morrow, feeling confident that Detec
tive Welsh's statement is ample to con
firm the non-existence of her father, thus
removing all obstacles in the way of her
getting her snug fortune.

"Nope. Go right ahead with your bus

"If you came to get warm," the clerk
suggested, "the heater is over on that side

"I didn't come to get warm. There's a

nal heat entirely unnecessary. I had a

"Over whom?" was the surprised query.
"Over the company."
"I â I must say I don't quite understand

"I suppose I'd better explain it. It's

STRANGELY WARNED.
The Supernatural Visitor That Saved
HÂ«r From the Sting of the Cobra.
The following remarkable occurrence,
a'i absolute fact, is related by a lady visit
ing friends in Hartford as it was told her
by her cousin in Meerat, Northwestern
India. It took place in the house of the
sister of the narrator. Of its absolute
accuracy there can be no question. The
two sisters in India are connected with
families of repute and with officers in the
British army in India. We give the story
as the lady her* related it. She is a devout
member of the Episcopal church, and is
incapable of misrepresenting in the
slightest particular.
Her cousin, in whose honse the occur
rence took place, was seated at a lighted
table engaged in reading, when thinking
it about time to retire, and happening to
lift her eyes from her book, she was as
tonished to see seated in a chair before
her, and betweeu herself and the door to
the bathroom, a man, ft stranger to her,
who calmly regarded her. Ii was too great
a surprise for her to sd ak and demand
who was thus intruding v a bidden upon
her privacy, and what was wanted. She
remained for a moment in silent as
tonishment.
Then it gradually dawned upon her that
the figure was probably not that of a
person of real flesh and blood, bui a visitor
from the unseen world of life. She re
membered having once, as a child, seen a
similar figure, under circumstances which
seemed to preclude the idea that v was
any person still in the body, and its later
years, in revolving those circumstances,
she bad remembered how the aoparition
had after a little while faded away into
invisibility. Concluding that this new
visitor also was not a person of flesh and
Dlood. she sat silently gazing at the silent
object, while the intruder, whoever or
whatever he was, sat also in silence stead
ily regarding her. Just how long this state
of things lasted, the lady did not accu
rately know, but it was probably not very
long when ihe mysterious stranger began
to vanish into a thinner and thinner per
sonal presence, until in a moment or two
he had vanished quite away.
It was the lady's hour for her evening
bath, but she thought she would^first let
out her two pet does from their "confine
ment in another room. They came bark
ing furiously and running directly toward
the bathroom. There through the open
door, the Jady was horrified to see on the
floor a monstrous cobra âthe snake whose
bite is certain and speedy death. Spring
ing forward to save her dogs, sbe quickly
shut the door, but not so instantaneously
as to prevent her s. eing the reptile turn
ing and escaping down through a hole in
the floor, where the drain pipes of bathtub
and washbowl went, a hole which had
been carelessly left larger than was neces
sary.
If she had gone directly to the bath
room, as she would have done but for the
intervention of her mysterious visitant,
her life would undoubtedly have been
sacrificed in the act.âHartford Times.
CONCERNING GOOD INVECTIVE.
Pope's Satire on Addlson Offered as a
Study in Polished Attack.
â . And â so it has â  always . been with ' the
higher specimens of invective. Without
a certain delicacy of modulation it misses
half its effect. Let us. recall Pope's in
vective; how deep it went, how carefully
its lights and â  shades were studied, how
fine were its graduations. : No one who
indulges the amiable widh to reach the
heart with a' poisoned arrow should
neglect to study the great satire on Addi
son in the letter to Dr. Arbuthnot; " How
carefully Pope led up to it by painting
first the unintentional error ;of > a dull
bard who â  did â¢ badly, in : pure ' ignorance,'
what he desired: to show that Addison did
with great subtlety in pure craft: .. r -
And he who now to sense, now nonsense leaning

Ail tnese my modest satire bad translate 1, <- , ;

How did they fume, and. stamp, and roar and chafe,
And swear not Addison himself was sale. l |
This is his preparation for the attack on
Addisou which he then delivers with the
most exquisite grace, delineating Addi
son's accomplished literary skill and moral
cowardice, and contrasting both with the
stupid fumbling of the man who "means
not, but blunders round about a meaning."

There you haye T the careful and dis
criminating eulogy. which leads up to the
attack, an attack which, as well as im
puting craft and cowardice to Adaison,
draws a careless comparison between him
and the mere bungler from whom "not
Addison himself -was' sale." The latter
meant not, but blundered "round about a
meaning." Addison meant, but fluttered
round about his meaning, because he was
too timid to say it out, and too jealous not
to hint it. V : * .; : - '
The ordinary idea of invective is a
literary blow which a bludgeon or a shot
with a blunderbuss that causes a great re
port, and | probably gives a deadly shock.
For example, Macauiay's' attack: on the
age of Charles II was invective of this
bludgeoning. Kind: ''Then came those
days never to be recalled without a blush,
the days of servitude without loyalty and
sensuality without love, of dwarfish
talents and 'gigantic vices, of cold hearts
and nartow minds, the polder, age of the
coward, the bigot and the slave." ; â¢_
That. was bludgeoning invective with a
vengeance,; but might it not have been
surpassed in effect if Macaulay had given
those days credit for â¢ their cynical wit,
their degraded and degrading humor, and
approached his attack upon them from
the side on which it would at least have
been possible to say something in , their
favor, and a great .,: deal more . against
them? That age's "talents," at least,
were by no means 'dwarfish, ;? though its
vices were gigantic. To our mind, the in
vective which is skillfully mingled with
an appreciation that makes the censure
more effective is the more rememberable
and the more wounding. Invective does
only half its worK when it merely stuns
the adversary, instead of ' piercing and
penetrating the joints of his armor. â Lon
don Spectator.
DRAWBACKS OF EDUCATION.
t ollege Training Is Too Apt to Deaden
the Student's Energy.
A second drawback of a college educa
tion is one wh.ch the public often real;zes,
but seldom calls attention to, viz.: the
training of the judgment of the student
at the expanse ot his energy. The extent
of this drawback will seem to some great
and to others slight. It cannot be doubted
that, if certain men had bad the ad
vantage of a training in weighing evi
dence and in seeing comprehensively â
qualities which the college especially dis
ciplines â they would have been saved from
mistakes many and momentous.
Tue Patent Office would not need so
large chambers lor the stowage of useless
inventions. But I also find myseli ask
ing: What would have been the effect of
college training on some of the more en
ergetic men of our time, who nave been
the leaders in aggressive industrial move
ments or masters of large affairs? What
would have been its effect on the older
generations o; that iamily which controls
certain railroais running between New
York and Chicago? Would the marvelous
and mtficniUcent enterprises of Commo
dore Vanderbilt have been rendered less
so by a college education.? Better judg
ment about many things he would have
bad; but would he not have had less en
ergy?
Great as is the need of good judgment in
the administration of affairs in the home,
the factory, the shop, the nesd of energy
is greater. Fewer men fail by reason oi a
lack of j.idgnient â numerous as t! e-e men
are â than from a lack of force. More men
are found sitting at the base of the moun
tain of some great enterprise because they
are too indolent to climb than are there
through ihek of wisdom how to make the
ascent. We Americuns plume and pr.de
ourselves upon being the most energetic
of nations; yet ourenergy lags behind our
judgment. It is, there ore, a serious mat
ter when the college causes her students
to run the risk oi losing euergy in order to
increase the riches of judgment Charles

BLACK IN JAIL
AT SAN DIEGO
The Pursuer of Outlaw
Evans Accused of
Murder.
Charged With the Assassination
of John Patterson at
National City.
Said to Have Eeen Seen in the Or
chard Where the Victim
Was on Watch.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Dec. 25.â Sam Black,
the ex-detective, is behind the bars of tne
County Jail, charged witn the murder of
John Patterson, the watchman at u.e Na
tional City orchard, on the evening of De
cember 23.
Patterson was guarding the orchard
against orange thieves and was shot in the
back. The thieves were driving a team
owned by Sam Black. An honr laier
Black appeared at his home, which is five
or six miles from the scene of the murder.
He told nis wife be had been out hunting
and that two men stole the rig from him
and got away, in broad daylight. He
hunted up an officer at once and spent tbe
greater part of the night in a search for
the alleged thieves. Black's story placed
tbe responsibility for tbe murder upon the
two mysterious men who stole hia team
and wagon.
The officers, after a thorough investiga
tion, refused to believe Black's story cf
the bold robbery, and are convinced that
Black himself was implicated in tbe mur
der. Daring the day a number of inter
esting developments have occurred which
throw still stronger suspicion upon Black.
Black said he left town alone to go hunt
ng, but a number of witnesses are said to
have been found who saw another man
with him â a carpenter named John Mit
ten. Mitten was looking for a gun to go
with Black, and afterward was met be
tween here and National City in company
with Black. Soon after 5 o'clock a man
in Sweetwater Valley, not far from the
tcene of the murder, walked behind
Black's rig and talked with the two men.
One, he said, strongly resembled Black,
and the other was a man whose descrip
tion tallies with that of Mitten.
The strongest evidence against Black,
however, is said to have been gleaned
from a young woman who works in a
Chula Vista packing-house. She is said
to have told the ofnosrs that she was near
the Land and Town Company's orchard
on the evening of tbe murder just before
dark and saw Sam Black in the orchard.
She knew the man, as he worked as a car
penter in National City, and she positively
identified him.
Black is the man who was shot in tbe
hip by outlaw Chris Evans while pursu
ing the bandit near Young's cabin in the
mountains back of Fresno.
POSE FOUND NOT GUILTY.
Jury Decide* That He Shot to Protect His
Mothrr.
SAN DIEGO,- Cal., Dec. 25 âAfter being
out all yesterday afternoon and last night,
the jury in the case of Albert J. Fos-.
charged with the murder of Manuel Bell
ina, returned a verdict of not guilty tnis
morning, and Fobs walked out of court
with his wife and three little childrm..
The jury was very stubborn, and it was be
lieved that it would have to be discharged
and a new trial ordered. Three men are
said to have held out for the conviction of
the defendant.
Foss and his mother live on adjoining
places in San Luis Key Valley. Bellina
lived some distance away. On the night
of September 19 Bellina called on Mrs.
Foss and left at JO o'clock. Young Foss
had heard a noise among his cattle, and,
taking bis gun, had walked around the
place and down past his mother's house.
He saw a man walking in the shadow,
and, being unaware that Bellina had
called at the house, he called out twice.
Bellina failed to answer, and Foss fired,
killing him instantly. Foss testified that
he shot to kill, from the fact that two
years before his aged mother had been
attacked by an Indian, and the son did
not propose to have the occurrence re
peated.

MILLIONAIRE CROUSE BABY.
She's Nino Years Old Now and Spends
57500 a Year.
A report of George C. Austin as referee
has been tiled in the Surrogate's Courtin
which he find 3 that $7500 a year should be
devoted to the education and maintenance
of Dorothea iidgarita Crouse, 9 years old,
and that to her mother, Eula H. Potulicka
or Kosterlitz or Crousv $32,450, which she
has heretofore expended in behalf of her
young daughter should be repaid.
The father of the child is understood to
nave been DÂ»vid Edgar Crouse of Syra
cuse, who died on November 21. 1892, leav
ing an estate estimated at $5,000,000. His
relatives thought that he had died a bache
lor, and were surprised when Eula H.
Potulicka appeared as his widow and with
her the child, Dorothea, who she declared
wa3 his daughter. It was shown that the
child had been born near Hastings, Ens.,
September 26, 1887, and that Crouse and
the mother had been abroad together for
a long time.
While actions were pending to assert
the claims of the alleged wife and child
a compromise was reached by which cer
tain large sums were given to the daugh
ter and her mother. The mother assigned
her claim to a lawyer. She says that
$400,000 was paid on her claim in settle
ment and that she received $125,000. She
iavested $75,000 of this sum and is draw
ing the income. The share of the daugh
ter in the compromise is said to have been
more than $1,000,000. The New York Se
curity and Trust Company was made
general guardian of the girl, and as such
it has already received of her share of the
estate $770,052 72. There is accumulate I
income of $17,343 73, and it is expected
that the income from tne $770,052 82 will
be $23,333 for the coming year, aside from
what further sums may be received for the
girl from the estate.
The mother of the girl testified before
tiie referee that on tne death of Crouse she
had a private estate of about $35,000 which
she has expended for the maintenance
and education of her daughter. She was
able to prove the expenditure of $32,450,
for which, the referee rinds, she should be
reimbursed. The mother has been living
in boarcing-houses here and abroad with
her daughter, spending part of the time at
the Swiss and Italian lakes.
It was shown that the daughter can
speak fluently English, French and Gei
man, and knows a little Italian. She has
had lessons in music, drawing, dancing
and gymnastics. She had horses and car
riages, two coach men, a maid, a governess,
a laundress and a coot. The mother said
that to maintain and educate the girl ac
cording to her station in life would require
an allowance from her income of from
$8000 to $10,000 a year.
The reieree said that $7500 as an allow
ance to the mother for the support of the
child is not excessive, in view of the in
come of the girl and the manner of life in
which the mother is bringing her up. â

PAPER HOTTLES.
They Are Said to Be Airtight, Water-
tight aud Better Than Glaus Ones.
The days of tbe glass bottle are num
bered. It is announced that in the near
future bottles will t>e made of paper. A
company has been formed to mauuiacture
them.
The advantages claimed for the paper
bottles are many. A glass bottle i 3 ex
tremely likely to break, and, in the case
of old wine,"the breakage of a bottle in a
i>in causes serious loss. The paper bottle,
it is claimed, cannot be broken, unless
considerable force is used. Bottles have
been made of toughened glass, and jars
have been' covered with wicker-work, but
still the breakages occur. It is claimed
that unbreakable paper bottles will Btcp
tbis.
Paper bottles can be (manufactured for
about half the cost of giass bottles, and
can be made water-tight as well as air
tight. As brewers well know, it is no
easy matter to make a glass bottle that is
airtight when beer is the liquor it con
tains. All kinds of experiments have
been made to accomplish this result, but
none have succeeded. With the paper
bottles tbe matter will be comparatively
easy, as the paper will give when tbe cork
is driven into the neck of the bottle and
will be sealed perfectly.
Glass bottles, too, will freeze, and their
contents spoil. In the paper bottles the
liquid can defy the efforts of the frost
sink. This will mean a saving in more
ways than one. There is no occasion for
the laborious packing in straw that has to
be done in the case of glass bottle?. The
paper bottles being practically unbreak
able there is no need for straw as a safe
guard against rough treatment while in
transit, and as the papier-mac c will keep
the contents warm there need be no pack
ing to keep the cold out.
The paper bottles are an American idea,
but the trade in them will be carried to all
parts of the world. No item of loss in
ocean traffic has been greater than that
caused by the breaking of bottles during
tbe rolling of a ship in rough weather.
On this account the paper bottles will be
welcomed in every quarter of the globe

New York's Sew Era.
There has been an extraordinary im
provement in New York in the last twenty
years. The city has grown not merely in
population, but in elements of strength
and greatness that count for more than
mere numbers. Architecturally there has
been a change that amounts almost to a
metamorphosis. The city is better
politically, cleaner physically and morally,
and more healthy. It has developed won
derfully as a center of art and music. Its
theaters have multiplied rapidly. It has
completed several important public works
and has projected others. It has com
menced a new bridge across the East
River and has planned a greater one
across the North River. Its colepes have
grown into universities with new sites and
new buildings. Tnousands of acres for
new parks have been bought. A botanical
garden on a large scale is soon to be
opened. And to crown this record of
mun cipal development there is to be a
consolidation with Brooklyn and suburban
territorj, creating a city next to London
in size and wealth, with a new charter

Led by Sir Francis de Winton,
Encountered Hardships,
And Proved the Wonderful Sustain-
ing Power, of VinO'Kolafra.
About eight ; years ago Sir Francis de
Winton was sent out from England to
Sierra Leone, Africa, to lead an expedition
against the Yonnie tribe, whose depreda-
tions bad seriously,. injured trade on the
west coast. In view of the interest now
taken in tbe Sterculia nut, which grows
in that region, it is worthy of note that in
preparing to set out for the interior Sir
Francis, together with the English officers
under him, commanding the West India
regiments, were careful to see that a sun-
ply iof this nut : was '* placed among the '
storesâ sufficient not only.for the soldiers,
but for the hundreds of carriers also.
This is without doubt the severest and
most laborious campaigning that men are
obliged to engage in, as all supplies have
to be "toted" on the heads of carriers
through the broiling troDical sun. There
are no roads, and it is often i necessary to
cut a passage through tangled thickets
and to ford streams. There are no horses,
camels or donkeys used at Sierra Leone;
the black man is the only beast of burden.
.: For strength and capacity. of. endurance
on a march like this both black people
and white depend on the Sterculia nut, of
which they partake as they, feel the â  need
of it. In addition to its power to sustain
the strength under these exhausting con-
ditions this remarkable nut unqtiestion-
aoly saves many white men from the
dreaded and deadly African fever. . 1
' It is particularly when rations fall short
that the " Sterculia nut proves of ines-
timable value, acting as a substitute for
food, quieting the uneasy stomach, | abat- "
ing hunger and thirst and enabling ' the
men to make progress under circum- ,
stances wherein they must otherwise have
succumbed; and that, too, with so little .
fatigue that the result may well be con-
sidered marvelous. :.â â¢â¢-â â :
Mr. Judson A. Lewis, late United States
Consul at Sierra Leone, who furnishes the
above information as of general interest,
had many conversations with Sir Francis,
both before he departed on his expedition .
and after his victorious return, and lays
that, in common with all who have ob-
served or tested the nut in Africa, Sir
Francis testifies to its amazing properties
as a tonic-stimulant when no other could
have been successfully employed.
This product is now available in Amer-
ica in the form of Vino-Kolafra from the
laboratory of the Brunswick Pharmacal
Company of 92 William street, New York.
It represents all the properties of the nut
and is commended by leading physicians,
chemists, athletes, professional and busi-
ness men. As a brain and heart and nerve
stimulant it is preferable to all others,
both- for efficiency and safety. It has no
reaction or bad "effect. Under its influ-
ence â which is gentle and pervadingâ tha
user can do more and better work, either
physical or mental, without fatigue or ex-
haustion. 1 '
For weak persons or chronic invalids
medical men I prescribe Vino-Kolafra in-
stead of the dangerous drugs formerly re-
sorted to as tonics. It gives strength, de-
creases pain. and hastens convalescence.
In all : forms of muscular effort Vino-
Kolafra produces the best result with the
least conscious exertion. It steadies the
heart and deepens the .breathing. It af-
fords a means of immediate escape from
the liquor habit, as it satisfies the craving
for alcohol. Â. , , . .;. ...
To the aged and feeble the African tonic .
is perfectly suited. It cheers, invigorates,
and in many cases seems to -restore much
of the vitality of earlier years.

PORTLAND, Ob., Dec. 25.â A surpris
ing and most interesting discovery has
been made by Elmer Thornburg on the
north fork of the John Day River, in the
steep hills opposite his mine, about nine
miles above the mouth of Granite Creek.
It will add another important page to the
history of the dim and iar-dis'.anl past.
Mr. Thornburg, with four men it; his
employ, had been engaged in driving a
drift through the rim rock on his
claim in the Blue .Mountain country,
and as the work was nearly completed he,
at the suggestion of tbe men, s-tarted out
to nnd a good tree to utilize in making
Aenowshoes. In wandering along the pre
"cipitous mountain side his attention was
attracted to waat appeared to be a narrow
opening in a cliff. Upon reaching the
spot, instead of lindi g an opening, he
found a smooth, neatly designed drift
1 about two and one-half lett in width and
five and one-half feet in height that was
evidently the work of man. Presuming
that it had been excava:ed by some pros
pector in search of earth's hidden treas
ures he entered the drift to investigate.
After proceeding for a distance of thirty
feet he was astonished to find that it ter
minated into what appeared to be, in the
semi-darkness, a spacious chamber. He
naturally abandoned the mission for
soowsboe timber ana returned in baste to
where the men were at wort and reported
his find:
"Supplying onrselves with a number of
candles we returned to thedrift,"he wri es,
"prepared to thoroughly explore the rock
bound room. The tunnel was thirty feet
in length from the opening to its intersec
tion with the room, and the latter was 14
feet 'long, 8% feet wide and 7 feet in
height and was excavated in the hardest
kind of black slate rock. Our surprise can
be much more readily imagined than de
scribed. Tha: the place had been the
abode of man at some time was evident,
and this inspired us to a minute search of
the premises in the hope that we would
discover something mat sho.iid throw
light upon the mysterious one-time occu
pant of this most unique habitation.
"The first thing to attract our attention
was a large urn-shaped vessel that had
either been molded from clay or chiseled
from some formation tbat would titand
the action of fire. It had evidently been
used by the strange occupant or occupants
in lieu of a scove for cooking and heating
purposes. Bowls and other vessels or pot
tery were scattered here and there, some
of them being elaborately carved and
decorated with what we considered to be
images of animals, but so indistinct as to
preclude the possibility of identifying
what they were intended to represent. In
one corner were a huge mortar and pestle,
both made of the hardest granite rock.
Stone implements were found, demon
strating most conclusively that the deni
ten of. the cliff lived before metals were in
use or known to the people of his time.
The handles of these implements â if they
ever had handles â had decayed, perhaps
ages ago.
"In another corner of the chamber was
found nearly a bushel of small pieces of i
flint, and near this stack of chippings were |
several spearheads and quite a number of j
arrowheads. The walls were nearly coy- j
ered with hieroglyphic?, while in the
alcove rudely cut out iraa an image that
we concluded was an idol. That image
had been made from some soft formation
and bad not resiste i very successfuly the
ravages of time. Joe Watts, who has
passed years of his lite in the Southern
States and who has found and examined
the relics of the prehistoric Aztecs, stated |
that he was confident tbat the inhabitants j
of the place were identified with the same
people who once populated the now arid
waste- of Arizona. Everything found in
the chamber was carefully removed and
will be sent to the Smithsonian Institu
tion.
LIKE A ROMANCE.
The Career of a Woman Who Was
.. Â° Brought From the Wilds of
Africa by Stanley.
A more remarkable history than that of
Mrs. Stansbury, who is now visiting
friend-, at 2935 Portland avenue, is seldom
recorded. Her story, while real, is not un
like many found in dime novels. It is
SUed with deeds of daring, thrilling ad
ventures and hair-breadth escapes from
blood-curdling situations in the jungles of
Africa. Mrs. Stausbury'a maiden name
was DeloochaCongree and she comes from
a tribe of people known as the EUaphias â
meaning people of strength â who inhabit
the shores of the Keine, a northern tribu
tary to the upper Congo River. All of the
people of her tribe, she says, are lar^e,
sinewy and strong, averaging 6% feet in
height* and that she is one of the smallest
of her tribe. Her weight it 180 pounds
and she is 6 feet 2 inches tall. The people
of the tribe from which she comes live to
be very old and do not begin to turn gray
until about 70 years of age.
"I am now 32 years old," said Mrs.
Btansbury to a visitor, "and am considered
by my people to be a young girl."
ffhe Ellapbias are expert hunters; ele
phants, lions and laree serpentÃ are the
sort of game they go for, and Mrs. brans
bury has many scars about her body as
BonVenirs of her desperate encounters.
She was among the leaders in their hunt
ing excursions and therefore jit the front
in every dancer.
This remarkable woman wears around
her shapely neck a long string of vari
colored beads, which she prizes more
highly than to many diamonds. They
imparted to "her her first idea of civiliza
tion. , , Â' -'"
Â£"TheÃe beads," said she, as she fondled
them, "were presented to me fifteen years
aeo by the first white man I ever saw.
Henry M. Stanley. He was ' then explor
ing Keine River, which, he believed,
gathered its waters from the Tepee Lake.
I was familiar tvitn the country and dif
ferent tribes for many miles around, and
on this account was asked to join the ex
pedition as enide. did so, and these
beads were given ;me for my services. > I
have worn ; them : about my neck ever
â ince, have never lost or broken a single
one, and, althougu I've several times been
offered large sums, money camot induce
me to give them up."
"Yes," she replied in answer to a ques
tion, "I do hear from Mr. Stanley occa
sionally," and here she went to a trunk
and brought from it a package of letters,
from which she extracted one and gave it
to her questioner to read. It was short,
in a clear, bold hand, and was written in
October of 1895. It reads as follows:
My Dear Mrs. Stansbury: Your letters give
me greater pleasure than does anything on
earth, for I cannot read them without remem
bering how, when in the deep recesses of the
dark continent, 1 discovered a latent quality
â¢which is now a shining mark in civilization.
I am glad to nota your progress In art and lit
erature; the illustrated poem just received
from you is a superb execution and very true
to African life. Your name will yet shine in
the pages of history as a remarkable example
of what can be accomplished in a short space
of time. Mrs. Stanley joins me in a hearty
good wish for your future success.
I hope to hear from you again very soon.
Until then I am, as hitherto, your friend,
H. M. Stanley.
"Yon see," she explained, "Mr. Stanley
brought me to New Yerk about ten years
ago as a servant. I liked New York and
would not go with him any further. I
found employment with a family who per
mitted me to attend school, and I re
mained with them thtee years. T.en I
came west to Cincinnati, where I again
entered school with a view to completing
my education. I worked and kept myseif
in school until three years ago, when I
got married. My husband was a barber
and lived only a year after our marriage.
Yes, I have apain'taken up my studies."
Mrs. Stansbury is a member of several
secret organizations, is a good singer and
well known in colored literary circles.

York.â Chicago News.
LEFT BY HOTEL GUESTS.
' How the Big Homes Care for Lost ami
Forgotten Articles.
Various railroads, big department stores
! and other places where many persons are
in the habit of pat ering, maintain a reg
ularly established bureau for the care of
I lost articles, but there is perhaps no place
I in the world where such a variety and
i number of articles are overlooked as in
' the great hotels, says the Ncjw York Trib
une. The departing guest has a habit of
leaving behind him, in the hurry of pack
ins?, a number of things of no use to the
! hotel, but frequently of great value to
I him. All the big hotels keep a place that
has been set aside for ihe classification of
articles lull in rooms and it is seldom that
I anything lost in a hotel cannot be re
i Claimed. Some of the articles lett behind
are lrequenily the cause of mirth and
j sometimes of much heartburning.
One of the funniest ana at the same
timfe serious cases ot oversight of this
kind happened in Buffalo a short time
ago. The ioss was due to a careless mother,
a maid that would obey orders even it
happened to break owners and a husband
that was inclined to be dictatorial. The
tan* band ami wife, accomi anied by a baby
\ about a year old and a maid, came to the
i hotel to remain for about a week. When
! they were goinc away the mother wished
| to pay a fareweil call to certain friends
i and left orders for the maid to bring the
i baby to the train with hei. A few
I moments after the mother had gone out
] the husband came in ana 'old the maid to
l go on an errand and ttien go to the sta-
I t:on, where he would meet her. The maid
| protested: "But uiadame said â "
"Nevermind what matiame said," went
!on the husband, in a testy manner. "Do
as I say and I will explain to madame."
Thea he went off and forgot all about the
matter. When the party gathered at the
train th^re was no baby to be found.
Mutual recriminations were in order, and
the husijand, after much reflection, placed
his wife on the train and returned with
the maid to the hotel. The baby was
I found sleeping peacefully in the crib.
I When the husband and maid arrived in
New York tne mother greeted her wan
dering lamb tenderly, but the husband
was not in an amiable Jrame of mind. In
this oiiy the story ieaked out, much to
tiie discomfiture of the husband, and he
has been busy expsaiinng it ever since.
One of the most remarkable instances of
lost and found took pl.ice at the Imperial
Hotel some time ago. There w;isa woman
staying at the hotel who;e husband was a
dealer in precious stoves. She had a
number of unset gems of unusual value
with tier, and one evening in the red room
she exhibited them to a number of friends.
After the jeweis had been admired for
some time she caretully returned them to
the chamois bag in. which she earned
them. When she got to her room that
eve; ing and loosed them over a diamond
ot several carats and valued at about
$1500 was found to be missing.
She at once gave notice and a hurried
search was made, but the gem could not
be found. For several days every one in
the hotel was busy looking for the jewel,
but owing to the fact that it was unset
there was little hope oi finding it. About
a week afterward a maid brought the
stone to the hotel office and said that she
had found it down between the carpet
and the rug. It >-ad evidently rolled out
of the woman's lap and found that snuÂ£
hiding place. The owner was only too
glad to get it bacK, and the maid now
wears a new biack silk dress when she
goes out on Sunday.
Canes, umbreilas, soiled cloths, gloves,
toothbrusnes, sc:irfpins, cuff-buttons, col
lar-buttons, clothes brushes and other
tilings of such personal nature are the
most frequently lorpoiten, and it is the
opinion of the average hotel clerk
that more writing and telegraphing are
done over a toothbrush or a shoehorn
than abo it a gold watch or diamond stud.
Numerous things are also left in thu store
room where trunks and valises are
checked. These are often left for months
with notting to identify them but tbe
little brass tag which is a duplicate
of the one civm the owner, although
trunks and vaiise3 are more usually me
mentos of unpaid bills. The theatrical
guests have a habit of leaving paints, pots
of grease, wigs, padding and all other
things that go to make up a good appear
ance for the stage. Wigs are most fre
quently left, and a good story is told about
a wig that was overlooked in one of the
New York hotels.
ENGLAND'S LIST OF SHAMEN.
The Available Number for Sea Service
Is Put i.t 85,818
Fancifu' intelligencers in naval matters
have lately been striving to take entire
possession of the public ear. Not on.'y
this, but the country has been surfeited
with a lot of nonsensical stuff anent the
numuers of all ranks available for sea
service. Sccalled experts Jail into a pal
pable mistake when they put it at 93,750,
which is the lotai number voted. Oniy
I 85,818 are available for sen service even
! on pater, the remaining 7932 being made
! up of 5300 boys under training and 1121 pen
sloners, besides 462 naval cadets and en
gineer students, while to complete the
list 1U49 other officers and men are em
ployee in different establishments and
services.
How are these 85,818 officers and men
ready to no anywlieieat an hour's notice
made up? PÂ«tty officers and seamen num
ber 56,420 but only 27.589 belong to the
seamen class. Enuin^-room artificers and
stokers absorb 19,023 of tne difference; ar
tisans, 3866: miscellaneous ratings, 5117;
while the balance is made up ot Kreemen
and Seedies, and natives of the Royal In
dian Marine, mustering 725 in all.
But there is a vast disparity in num
bers existing between the 56,420 men in
the petty officers and seamen class and
the 85,818 available for sea service. Ma,
rines account for 15,000 of this difference
officers for another 4842, while there are
4200 in the coastguard. What an absurdity
to talic of all these guardians of our coast
being available for sea! To cap ali, we
have 4495 boys afloat, in addition to the
6300 previously noticed under training
and ineffective. That is to say, our boys
number 9795, or one-six of our entire avail
able force of petty officers and seamen
class, or more than one-tenth of the ioial
numbers (93,750) borne. These facts and
figures shou.d be studied by tlioÂ«e who
pretend to keep reason and authority over
their public statements concerning our
naval personnel.â Luudoa Kxcaaugo.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALE., SATURDAY, DECEMBER 26, 1896.
CHRISTMAS PRAISE
AT ST. FRANCIS
Some Most Beautiful Deco
rations Were to Be
Seen.
The Crib Containing the Divine
Infant in All Catholic
Churches.
Father Caraber's Sermon Replete
With Interesting Remi
niscence.
From the standpoint of profuse and
tastetul decoration, St. Francis Catholic
Church was a dream of beauty yesterday.
The ornamentation of the church was done
wholly by Miss Mary Dowling, Miss Katie
Fitzsimmons. Miss Minnie Doane, Miss
Mallon and Mrs. Cunningham. No pains
were spared by these ladies to secure an ar
tistic effect.
The large columns of the church had
each a circlet of evergreen. In front of
the choir's gallery hung festoons of the
same material, while directly above the
festoons was a row of wreaths of ever
green and holly berry sprigs intertwined.
At the left of the church, near the altar
of the Blessed Virgin, was a crib contain
ing the Divine Infant, over which Joseph
and the Blessed Virgin Mary keDt tender
watch. Around it were placed several
large bouquets of calla lilies in vases,
whiie at the feet of the Virgin, directly
over the crib, was a handsome floral offer
ing sent in by a lady parishioner. On a
background of piuk flowering, these words
apoeared in violets: "Hail full of grace."
The pulpit was also festooned and
wreathed. The altar, which contains
some of the richest candelabra of any
church in the City, was wonderfully
wreathed and festooned with smilax,
fern?, evergreens and holly. The vases
were filled with bright-red holly berries,
which gave an enlivening effect to the
whole. The two small minareted gate
I'D ts at the communion rail were em
bowered in smilax.
The first in;is< was held at 5 a. x. by
Rev. Father T. Caraher, at which the
juvenile choir rendered "Adeste Fideles"
and other appropriate hymns. Mass was
celebrated every hour till 11 A. M. conclu
sive!y.
The solemn high mass at 11 o'clock was
celebrated by Rev. Father P. Heslin.
Father Caraher ottiriated as deacon and
Father Giles as sub-dencon. The sermon
was preached by Father Caraher.
He chose his text from the words of the
angel, "Behold, I bring you good tidings
of great joy, which shall be to all tbe peo
ple, for this day is born to you a Savior,
which is Christ the LordJ in the city of
David." In his exordium he stated that
Christmas day of 1894 was the most mem
orable day of his life, for on that occasion
he celebrated three masses in the cave of
tiie Nativity at Bethlehem.
Continuing, he pointed out tbe lessons
taught from the crib by the Divine Infant,
and in his peroration exhorted bis hearers
more faithfully and mlly to practice those
lessons in the future.
ST. MARY'S CHURCH.
Some Beautiful Windows and Two
Sets of Vases Presented.
At St Mary's Catholic Church services
were celebrated from 5 until 11 a. m. by
Rev. Father H. H. Wyman. At 11 there
vas a solemn nigh mass. Father Wyman
preached an eloquent sermon appropriate
to the feast.
The church was beautifully decorated
by the Sisters of the Holy Family, as
sisted by several ladies of the parish.
From the candle supports of the church
columns hung wreaths of evergreen inter
twined with red holly berry sprigs. The
altar was neatly decorated with ferns,
holly and smilax.
At the left, amid a bower of ferns,
boughs of pine and huge ci-usters of
lilies, the roof being covered vith cotton,
stood the crib of the infant Savior,
watched over by Mary and Joseph. This
was the most carefully prepared repre
sentation of the Cnrist in the crib in any
of the churches of the City.
Much attention was attracted to the new
windows of the church, which were
placed in during last week. They repre
sent St. Ambrose, St. Martin, St. Boniface
and St. Francis. Two beautiful pairs of
vases, the gifts of parishioners, were also
seen at the altar.
ITALIAN CATHOLIC CHURCH
Father Fltzpairlck Officiated at the
Solemn High Mass.
At the Italian Catholic Church high
m.iÂ«s was conducted at 5 A. M. by Rev.
Father R. de Carolis. At 9 o'clock the
juvenile choir sang several appropriate
antherab. At 10:30 a solemn high mass
was had, Father Fitzpatrick celebrant.
Sermons were preached at 9 and 10:30 by
Father de Carolis. Both were on the sub
ject of tbe Nativity.
From the column posts at the extremi
ties of the altar hung two lons streamers
of evergreen. The altar itself was care
fully decorated with smilax, holly sprigs,
wreaths and festoon?.
Just near each extremity of the com
munion rail was a small palm tree.
The cut ot the infant Savior was at the
left of the church. Near this bower of
evergreen was a small pine tree. The
cnurch columns were garlanded with smi
lax.
SPANISH CATHOLICS.
Some Very Tasteful Floral Decora-
tions Were to Be Seen.
The services at the Bpanish Catholic
Church were conducted by Rev. Father
Antonio San Andreas. Mass was cele
brated at sa. m. and every hour till the
occasion of solemn high mass at 11.
The church was decorated with great
care. J'rom the candle supports on the
columns hung wreaths of evergreen and
holiy berries. The sides of the wall were
bedecked with bright flowers of various
kinds.
Several large hemispheres of smilax,
hyacinth and holly berries were tastefully
arranged around '.he altar. The altar

THE HAT FASCINATED HER.
An American Woman's Advice to an
Kngligh Visitor.
An English piri came over here not long
ago, says the New York Evening Sun,
with the avowed purpose of wheedling
American money out of American pock
ets. She was a recitationist by profession,
and her plan was to make a bold and de
termined assault upon the drawing-room
audience. The girl may have had talent
and sbe may not. What most impressed
the Americans who came in contact with
her was her rigid conformation to the
British laws of dress. Ooupteii with
a leaning toward the esthetic the re
sults were appalling. Dingy, shabby
and trailing garments that did duty
for frocks; such hair as surely was never
seen outside of frowsy footballdom. and a
kind of milinery miracle instead of a hat â
such were some of the details. The hat
was the worst of all. When the English
aspirant for American dollars presented
her first letter of introduction, its recipi
ent, a smart New York woman, found her
eyes drawn to that hat as nothing had
ever drawn them before. It fairly fasci
nated her. She listened to the girl's plans,
her aspirations, her need?; bat tbe hat
was in the foreground. ''And now, Mrs.
Blank," said the girl, when she had fin
ished her statement, "what would you ad
vise me first of all to do?" "Do? " echoed
Mrs. Blank. "Take that dreadful thing off
your head, and go out and buy a decent
American bat."
THE CAPTAIN TOLD HIM.
An Englishman "Who Forgot About the
Letter II
An Englishman who was touring
through America on board a steamer when
one morning, aiter walking on deck and
looking round him, he stepped up to the
captain, says Tit-Bits, and asked: "I beg
pardon, but would you kindly tell me
what lake I'm on?"
"Tbe Lake Huron," replied the captain
and turned away.
The Englishman looked puzzled for a
moment and th^n, following the captain,
began again: "I beg your pardon, you
saidâ"
"It's the Lake Huron," roared the cap
tain, thinking the man was deaf.
"Yes, 1 know," persisted the passenger,
"but what's the name of the lake that I'm
on?"
"The Lake Huron!" shouted the cap
tain, incensed at what he thought gross
stupidity, and he turned away to relieve
himself by railing at one of" the bands.
The Englishman looked more puzzled
than ever.
"The lake you're on is the lake you're on.
Of course it is! The laka I'm on can't help
being the lake I'm on. What imperti
nence! Let me look at my guidebook â
perhaps that will help me."
It did teiJ him and then the humor of
tbe situation suddenly dawned upon him.

DEAD IN A DITCH
AT MIDNIGHT
Frank Scott's White Face
Upturned to the Lan
tern's Light.
Coroners of Two Counties Re
fuse to Take Charge of
the Remains.
The Accident Happened at Sundown
and the Body Still Lies by
the Roaiside.
Frank Scott, an engineer. 29 years oIJ,
employed by Warren & Malley at their
stone quarry in San Mateo County, lies
dead in a ditch out on the San Bruno
road, and neither the Coroner of San
Mateo County nor of San Francisco
County will take charge of the remains.
Scott was killed just after sundown last
evening, and the body was stiff, cold and
still in the ditch at midnight. Lanterns
in the hands of spectators brought the
white face into view last night, but all
were afraid to touch the body till some
Coroner acts.
Scott was driving into the City last
evening. He was alone. News of his
death reached tbe City late and particu
lars are meager. He drove off an embank
ment at the side of the road near the
Six-Mile House and the horse was hurled
to the bottom of the ditch, and it is sup
posed his neck was broken..
The place of death is in Ban Mateo
County. Tne Coroner of that county was
notified by telephone of the accident and
deatn. He refused to take charge of the
case or remains.
A man named James Elliott then tele
phoned Police Captain Gillen of the Sev
enteenth-street station, who in turn noti
fied Deputy Coroner O'Brien. He also
refused to take charge of the remains as
the location is outside San Francisco
County.
Anolher attempt will be made to-day to
get the San Mateo Coroner to act.
James Crowe is the Coroner of San Ma
teo County. He is le ported to have tele
phoned that it was "too dark and too
cold" to come down and take charge of
tLe remains. The spot is cleariy beyond
the jurisdiction of Coroner Hawkins or
his ueputies.
A STORY OF PROGRESS.
Western Settlement Without Parallel
In the History of Civilization.
The report of the Secretary of the In
terior shows that since the passage of the
homestead law there have been nearly
163.0U0.000 acres of public lands entered by
settlers, and over 335,000,000 acres have
been acquired under other laws. That is
to say, the area of settlement and cultiva
tion has been enlarged within the lifetime
of the present population of the country
to tbe extent of 498,000,000 acres. These
figures tell a story that is without a paral
lel in tbe history of civilization, and one
that can hardly oe comprehended without
the aid of the imagination.
They are tquivaient to an increase of
3,11i,250 farms of 160 acres each, or twice
mat number of the average size of such
estates in the localities where most of the
entries and purchases have been made.
This means a corresponding multiplica
tion of the homos of the people, with all
of the attendant gains of comfort and
happiness.. Mever beiore in a like period
since the beginning of time has so much
been accomplished in the way of ma
terial development and the extension of
the means and opportunities of prosper
ity. The record includes, of course, not
merely a widening of the domain of agri
culture, but the forming of new States,
the construction of railroads, tbe building
of churches and scboolhouses and the
general advancement of the interests of
humanity.
There are yet about 600,000,000 acres of
public lands, not including Indian and
military reservations, estimated at 86,
-960,000 acres, and the district of Alaska,
but ihe most of this residue is considered
worthless for civilization. It may be said,
therefore, that the end of this process of
development has practically been reached.
There is no longer any frontier with
tempting possibilities for home-seekers.
The old song, "Uncle Sam is rich enough
to give us all a farm," ha* ceased to be
true, 'so fur as vacant territory is con
cerned. There is still a West, but it is
now only a geographical expression, and
does not signify what it formerly did to
people anxious to better their condition
through the toil and privation of pioneer
life.
In the course of events the remaining
Indian reservations will be opened to
settlement, undoubtedly, and there is
reason to expect that the large stretches
of arid lands will ultimately be made till
able by some system of irrigation, but the
general fact at present is that compara
tively little chance is left for securing
homes from the Government. It will
never be possible to duplicate the scheme
of beneficence and progress that has en
abled so many industrious and deserving
citizens to become landowners. The situa
tion has been permanently changed and
a new era has dawned, with different con
ditions and tendencies.
We may well give serious thought to the
importance of the work of development
thai is thus brought to a stop by the ex
haustion of material, so to speak. It im
plies a great deal more than a wonderful
increase of individual warfare. The ef
fects which it has produced are not con
fined to the classes or localities immedi
ately concerned. It has brought radical
changes to pass for the whole country
and for all elements and interests. In a
sense it has compelled a readjustment of
business methods and appliances from
the Atlantic to the Pacific, and even be
yond the oceans to sos.ie extent. Its
abundant products constitute a potential
factor in the markets of the entire world,
the influence of its energy and its enter
prise is felt everywhere in financial and
commercial operations.
Moreover, it has invaded the politics of
the country, raising new issues and intro
ducing new sources of inspiration; and it
has not failed at the same time to make a
decided impression upon the social affairs
of the Nation. It stands for a great em
pire that lias been evolved out of the grass
and silence of tbe public lands since the
clo-e of the Civil War. No other force of
equal strength and significance has ever
been added to our facilities of achieve
ment. It is to be regarded with pride and
exultation by the people of all sections
and all parties, and surely in the future it
will be worth still more to us than it has
been in the past. â St. Louis Globe-Demo
crat.
London Club Conservatism.
A story comes from London which illus
trates the innate stubbornness of young
John Bull. The Reform Club of that city,
which is the stronghold of the Liberal
party, and to which all the Liberal aris
tocracy beiong, is rent in twain at the
present moment through the generous
offer of a member of the institution who
resides in Chicago. Having observed that
there was no elevator on the premises, he
offered to give $3000 to supply i the : de
ficiency. The club is only.two stories high,
the upper level being gained by a double
flight of broad and carefully graded stair
cases, , which ; are, however^ difficulty of
ascent.t o those ' older v members who are
rendered infirm by age and by gout. These,
of : course, gratefully r welcomed the gen
erous offer of their Chicago fellow-mem ber.'
The younger element, however, objected
to the elevator, and the result was that
rival petitions have been circulated, half
the club being in favor of the elevator and
half against it. The tight wages fierce and
bitter, and the committee finds itself in so
great a quandary about the matter that a
general meeting of the club has been called.

ANCIENT BILLS OF EXCHANGE.
Credit Entered In in Tranaction of Busi-
ness Centuries Ago.
The United States Consul at Barcelona
recently mentioned thu acquisition by a
public institution there of seven old bills
of exchange, all made payable in Barce
lona. The most ancient is dated at Mal
lorca (Palma) in 1392, and is thought to be
the oldest bill of exchange now in exist
ence. The second is dated 1399; the third,
drawn in Pisa, is also dated 1399; the next
two were drawn in Valencia In 1411 and
1530 respectively; the sixth was drawn at
Rosellon, in France, in 1445; and the last
at Naples in 1535.
A translation of the first reads as fol
lows: "Sir: In conformity with this first
letter you will pay within the next two
months, counting from the date of this,
to the woman Sibila, wife of the deceased
Mr. Jaime Castello, xvli libras x suÂ°ldos
(about 355.) of Barcelona money, which
obtain from the rent of the University of
Mallorca on the 11th of December, the
payment of which you will require in due
time without fail. Dated at Maliorca th 9
26th day of October, year 1392.â Guillem

A Sidewalk Artist.
Some years ago there was a poor man
who drew pictures of soldiers and dogs and
ships on a bit of smooth sidewalk in
Hampstead road and collected pennies
from such art lovers as chanced to pass.
One of his most frequent patrons was Dv
Maurier, who on a certain cold day was
moved by the pitiable appearance of his
humble professional brother and offered
to guard the imploring hat while its owner
went to a soup kitchen in Euston road.
As soon as the man was out of sight tbe
deputy hastily erased all the pictures he
had been left to exploit and replaced them
with portraits in chalk of society ladies
and gentlemen, like those famous in
Punch. An appreciative public mani
fested interest to the extent of many cop
pers and two or three sixpences. When
the less famous artist returned he was
pieased to find so much in his bat, but re
gretted that his work had been destroyed.
"This may attract some people, but it
ain't art," he said to Dv Maurier, and im
mediately wiped out the society lights,
"but this pleases everybody," and he drew
the picture of a soldier. â London Letter.
Early Morning Row.
John Lynch, an ex-prizefighter, and his
friend, whose name is unknown, entered the
saloon of Joseph Gastell, at 206 Montgomery
avenue, at 1 o'clock this morning and assaulted
the proprietor.
Gastetl drew a pistol on his assailants and
nreii one shot. Officers arrived and arrested
Lynch, who was taken :o the California Police
Station and charged with battery.
Died From Inhaling Gas.
Mrs. Rosier, who resided at 325 Duncan

"THE CALL" SPEAKS . FOR ALL
MORGAN'S QUEST
IN DISTANT CHINA
N
The Welsh Millionaire Gold
Mine Owner After
Rich Minerals.
Is the Intimate Friend of Li
Hung Chang, Viceroy of
the Empire.
He Is Backed by a Powerful Syndi
cate and Will Seek for
Various Franchises.
Hon. "WilUam Pritchard Morgan, a
noted barrister and member of tbe Brit
ish Parliament for Wales, will arrive hers
in a few days from London.
He is on his way to China to see Li Hnng
Chang, and confer with him in regard to
investments in China for a powerful Brit
ish syndicate which he represents. Li
Hung Chang, the great Viceroy, is a par
ticular friend of Mr. Morgan, and there is
much interest in England as to what the
latter will effect through nim.
One object of the visit of Mr. Morgan to
China is to search for minerals of different
kinds in the country lying between Shang
hai and Peking. This wa3 announced not
long since in England by John Vaughan,
the intimate associate of Mr. Morgan.
Mr. Morgan has had a strange career.
He has acquired a very large fortune in
recent years, and all through his own ef
forts. It is not long since, as a young
man with only a theoretical knowledge of
law, he went to Wales. He soon became
interested in the gold mines there, started
up work on a number, and to the surprise
of many capitalists and others who had
tried it before him, began to make them
pay. The more men he employed and
the deeper he got the richer the mines be
came, until now he is concede^ to be tha
man above all o hers who has shown that
there is great wealth in the gold mines of
Wales.
How long he will stay in China is not
definitely known, but it is supposed that
it will be long enough to enable him to
carry out his projects and gain conces
sions for taking out the richer ores in that
country. From indications also it is be
lieved he will interest himself and the
syndicate with him, in building railroads,
and in other enterprises.
Dr. P. H. larrell of this City has for
some years been a cloÂ°e friend of Mr.
Mo.'gan. He speaks of him as a gentle
man ot great push and ability.
Mr. Morgan arrived in New York sev
eral days airo. He will cross the continent
leisurely, stopping at different points of
interest, to San Francisco. Arriving here,
he will remain long enough to see the
City and near-by attractions, and will
then tO to Vatcouver and take a steamer
for China, via Yokohama.
He will probably be in China several
months. There has been considerable in
British newspapers lately in regard to tha
trip of tbe Welsh millionaire pold mine
owner. Morgan is expected here now
very soon.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL. ~
It was a great Christmas.
"We had as much joy as anybody.
To-day we recuperate and to-morrow we
rest.
There are still a few norelties on the bar
gain counter.
The housekeepers will now whirl in and
make a clean sweep.
It wouldn't be a bad idea to make this
also a holiday and take it easy.
The most popular job with statesmen in
these days is that of helping McKinley.
There would be lots of happy gossip if
we only knew what the mistletoe could
tell.
Ten chances to one your presents will
look prettier to-day than they did yester
day.
Read our advertisements and you will
see there are several bargains left for New
Year's.
In the economical household the rem
nants of the turkey can be made as good as
the feast.
Now is the time to begin making up your
mind as to what you will swear off on New
Year's day.
If you were too busy yesterday to send
. the Christmas Call to your Eastern friends
ynu can do so to-day.
There are few happier people to-day than
the members of the Salvation Army and
few better deserve their happiness.
The New York scheme for establishing
an ideal newspaper was good, but it has
now been abandoned and that is better.
It would be a big joke on the Senators
If Cleveland should take it into his head
to recognize Cuba before Congress meets
- again.
If the Spanish butchers could succeed
in chopping Cub 3up into fish bait Cleve
land would begin to take an interest in
the matter.
The one objection to the anti-noise
crusade is that it can never succeed until
it makes more noise in the world than
anything else.
In dealing with onr foreign relations
Cleveland persistently ignores the fact
that Cuba is near enough to as to be
called a home relation.
An attempt to rush a funding bill
through Congress at bicycle speed will
produce a hot fight. It will take a scorcher
to try it and he will be roasted in doing it.
If Santa Clans overlooked anybody in
California yesterday it was not intentional
for he had mar.}' earnest and kind hearted
men and women looking everywhere to
see whom they could help.
The British Government has appointed
a royal commission to look after the
sug".r industry of the West, Indies, but
that need not disturb us. We have Â«Â» Re
publican commission in Congress to look
after ours.
William Lee of Boston, whose guest
ex-Queen Liiiuokalani will be while in
that city, says she has made the trip
simply for a change of scene, and in going
from Honolulu to Boston at this season
she will certainly get it.
The Congressional recess is longer than
usual this year, as Congress will not meet
again until January 5. This will give
Cleveland time enough to get up another
message if he should happen to feel like
annoying the country any further.
The official returns of Arkansas show
that eighty-six votes were cast in that
State at the last election for Jefferson
Dsvis for Presidential elector. As no man
of that name was running for the office
the votes were probably intended for
Andrew Jackson.
In order to make a metropolitan Boston
that will rank with the biggest cities
in the world there is a movement to in
corporate with that city twenty-eight sur
rounding municipalities, thus expanding
the hub to the rim of the local universe
and taking in all the felloes in sight.
Senator Hill of New York not only
stands no chance of re-election this win
ter, but it is sp.id he will not even get the
complimentary vote of ihe Democrats in
the Legislature of his State. He crawled
into a hole during the campaign and both
factions of the party seem inclined to
leave him there.
The Florida delegation in Congress are
trying to get an approbation to defray
the cost of destroying the water hyacinth,
an aquatic plant, which is said to be
choking up the rivers of the State and
impeding navigation. Thus while Uncle
Bam is busy propagating plants in one
place he is called on to whirl in and de
stroy them in another.
The City Vigilance League of New Yorkv
in urging the election of its candidate' lor
the United States senatorship, says of
nim: "He fills a larce angle in the gen
eral regard because of his native propor
tions and not because he has acquiredJjtilft
art of conspicuity." The description was
intended for Joseph Choate, but it sounds
like Chauncey Depew.
LEGISLATIVE WORK.
The near approach of the time for the
assembling of the Legislature has given
opportunity for utterance to all who have
axes to grind, fads to promote, schemes to
advance or reforms to advocate. Enough
of these have already given voice to their
desires to make it evident that this Legis
lature will not differ from former ones in
the multitude of bills it will be asked to
consider and the multitude of jobs it will
have to investigate and avoid.
It is to be hoped that no considerable
number of legislators will be inclined to
give encouragement to faddists, jobbers or
theoretical reformers. There is plenty of
really important legislation needed by
the State to give even the most industri
ous members of either house all the work
he can rightly attend to during the ses
sion. It is to that legislation the mem
bers should direct their energies, paying
no more attention than courtesy requires
to that class of people which in default of
a better phrase may be termed legislative
nuisances.
Rarely in our history has a Legislature
been called upon to deal with so great a
number of issues of first-class importance
as now await consideration. As a part of
the business of the session our legislators
will have to consider the work of tte Code
Commission, amendments to the irriga
tion law, tax reform, a revision of the
election laws and of the law of libel, and
the question whether the Railroad Com
mission shall be given increased powers
or be abolished as useless to the State.
There is also much hard work to be
done in properly adjusting appropriations
for the maintenance of State institutions
and providing for the routine work of the
State administration. It will be seen,
therefore, that if the Legislature under
takes to devote much time to side issues
or Bets out to reform everything in sight
it will have to neglect matters of practical
importance and pressing urgency.
What is wanted is a business session de
voted to economy where economy is
needed and to the work of wisely amend
ing such laws of the State as experience
has proven to be unjust in their opera
tions or injurious to the welfare of the
people. If the Legislature will give us
that sort of a session it will win golden
opinions from all sorts of people. It will
become known as the Legislature of a
thousand virtues.
RECIPROCITY.
According to reports from Washington
the principles of reciprocity and retalia
tion in trade will be important features of
the new tariff bill, and will occupy a con
siderable part of the attention given to
that measure. Some difference of opin
ion exists as to the way in which these
principles should be provided for, and
there is likely to be no little discussion on
the subject when the bill is reported to the
next Congress.
It has been suggested that the United
States could with advantage adopt a sys
tem which it is said ha 3 beon successfully
tried by several European nations. Under
this system the tariff law would provide
for three rates of duties. The highest
duty will be applied to all imports except
when otherwise specified. The second
duty will range from 25 per cent to 50 per
cent less than the first, and will be ap
plied to all imports from countries which
make equivalent concessions. The third
duty will be still lower and may be an
nulled altogether, in order to provide for
imports from countries which admit our
exports at equally low duties or without
any duty whatever.
Another plan is that proposed by Rep
resentative Hopkins of Illinois, which di
vides all foreign countries and colonies
into five classes, and arranges the tariff
duties in accordance with the comparative
rating of their trade with the United
States. The classification as recom
mended divides various countries into the
following categories:
1. Those whose exports to are greater than
their imports from the United States.
2. Those whose chief articles of export are
admitted free Into the United States.
3. Those whose exports are admitted into
the United States at an average rate of duty
lower than the average rate of duty imposed
upon the products of the United States by
their customs tariffs.
4. Those which impose higher rates of duty
upon the products of the United States than
are imposed upon the same or similar products
of other nations; And,
5. Those which ImpoÃe restrictions that are
unjust and excessive, and unnecessarily ob
struct the expansion of our commerce.
According to the Hopkins plan the
President will be authorized to negoti
ate reciprocity arrangements with all
these countries so as to equalize
trade and secure for our products in their
markets the same advantage their pro
ducts enjoy in ours. Different arrange
ments will, of course, have to be made
with each of the several classes, and the
work of dome this will, of course, have to
be left to the President, since it would be
impossible for Congress to specifically pro
vide for them.
Whether either of these or some other
plan be adopted, it is certain the reciproci
ty clause of the next tariff will be more
important even than that which produced
such good results in the McKinley law. It
will depend upon the Secretary of State to
make full use of the advantages given by
the clause and obtain for the people all
the benefits which are possible under it.
With such an administration as may be
confidently expected from President Mc-
Kinley we can count on a degree of activ
ity in the State Department that will assure
the speedy negotiation of trade * treaties,
and the proposed reciprocity therefore
will likely result in an immediate expan
sion of our commerce, and possibly in se
curing us almost the whole of the markets
of South America.
THE PUNDING BILL.
.The debate in toe Senate on Tuesday
was something of a surprise to those who
beard it and possibly to those who took
part in it. It was expected to be a debate
on the Cuban question, and it turned out
to be a controversy over the funding bill.
The Senators, it seems, were so eager to
get at the problem involved in the Pacific
roads debts they were not only unwilling
to wait for the House to send them the
funding bill, but turned aside from the
grave crisis of Cuban affairs to discuss the
question.
The whole tenor of the debate gave evi
dence that the settlement of the Pacific
roads debts will be the chief fight of this
session of Congress. Even the controversy
as to whether tfce President haÂ« the ex
clusive right of determining when and
how this Government should recognize
the independence of Cuba will be less ag
gressively fought out than the is?ue be
tween the people anil the monopoly
involved in the decision whether Congress
shall or not foreclose the mortgage on the
defaulting roads.
It is gratifying to the people to note]
that in this first skirmish of the grÂ«ati
battle the victory was decidedly on the;
part of the supporters of the Government.
Senator Morgan, who has made, himeeif
the leader of the opposition to funding the'
debts, did not nave to light the battle
alone. He found an able and eloquent
THE SAN FRACNISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 26, 1896.
ally in Senator Pettlgrew, whose speech
in the debate gave promise that he will bo
one of the foremost, and most earnest
champions of the people when the great
contest comes to the closing struggle.
The debate was precipitated by a resolu
tion introduced by Senator Pettigrew
directing the Secretary of the Treasury to
pay the interest on the 6 per cent trust
notes of the Union Pacific Railway and
take possession of the bonds and stocks
held as collateral for them. The object of
the resolution, as Petiigrew explained it,
is to protect the interests of the Govern
ment as a business measure. The Sena
tor asserted that the receivers of the Union
Pacific Company do not intend to pay the
interest on these trust notes, so as to com
plicate the problem and if possible compel
the Government to adopt some form of re
funding the debt which wonld be advan
tageous to the defaulting roads.
While the debate on the resolution led
to no result further than its reference to
the- appropriate committee, it was to a
certain extent beneficial, inasmuch as it
drew the fire of some of the advocates of
the monopoly in the Senate, and led them
to show the tactics which will be resorted
to to bring about the passage of a funding
bill. To tuat extent the debate was a gain
for the people. It opened the fight
auspiciously and showed that the oppo
nents of the monopoly do not intend to
stand altogether on the defensive. They
are aggressive fighters, ready to take the
offensive as soon as an opportunity offers.
The course of the battle therefore prom
ises a victory for the Government and the
people, and at any rate it is certain that
the prearranged plan of rushing the fund
ing bill through Congress is doomed to
failure.
THE SUNDAY "CALL."
To-morrow's Call will contain, among
its numerous attractive features, a de
scription of a new invention which will
rank high in the realm of scientific dis
covery. It is no less than the construc
tion of an artificial eye that sees. It is
difficult to realize the actuality of such an
achievement, but the facts speak for them
selves, and are lucidly set forth in
the able article treating of the mat
ter which is of such wide im
portance. In truth, science appears to
have outdone nature in at least one re
gard, for it is claimed that the artificial
orb is far superior to the natural eye.
Psychic New Year parties will try by
occult power to discover what fate has in
stall for the members. This is a society
fad that will reisn on New Year's day,
and popular attention will be claimed by
the elucidation of the mode of conducting
it which will appear in Sunday's Call.
"America's Strangest Tower" will treat
of an edifice in this country that is more
of a wonder than the "Leaning Tower of
Pisa."
A plan that will revolutionize the pres
ent method of transmitting information
by signaling in the United States navy is
discussed by Commander R. G. Tupper,
R. N.
One of the particularly fine features
will be the publication of the words
and music of the "Song to the
Moon," as sung with brilliant suc
cess by the Brownie king in Palmer
Cox's play at the Baldwin Theater. Every
body will want this rare prize of a song,
witii its local humorous hits, and it will
appear exclusively in The Sunday Call.
There will be a wealth of good things
that will make The Sunday Call eagerly
sought lor by all who appreciate a splen
did family newspaper.
HOW THE AMERICANS TEACH
PATRIOTISM.
London Truth.
"An Old-fashioned Patriot" writes to say
that the attention of persons who love their
country has lately been called by articles in
American magazines to the systematic man
ner in which the sentiment of patriotism is
developed in their higher schools for girls.
The pupils are regularly drilled to perform an
exercise of "saluting the flag" in military
style. They are made'familiar with the past
of their country, and in its very short history
everything that is glorious or can be a subject
of National pride is brought before them till
an enthusiasm for the "Star-spangled Banner"
clows in every young heart We copy America
in many things; would that we might copy
her in educating the young to know the gloiies
of their country's past and to reverence its
flÂ«g. Our people do not care for their flag.
They do not know the meaning of the Union
Jack. To them one flag is as good as another â
anything that has a bright color â and when a
town is draped for some festivity any flags are
made use of; the greater number always have
the French tricolor. "I had ratner," this
patriot says, "see the American stars and
stripes. They are our brothers in blood."

them.
Mr. Potter thinks there Is no place like
J-os Angeles. Like G. J. Griffith, the philan
thropist, who a little over a week ago gave a
3000-anre park to that city, hs is entirely
satisfied with the place, considering it in all
respects ideal.
He will only remain here a few days, as he is
desirous of getting back to his interests in the
Southland as soon as possible.

LADY'S NIGHT ROSE.
Night robes made in the old-fashioned sack
shape, with very large sleeves and a bip col
lar, are very pretty, and have the advantage
of requiring less material than other shapes.
The back may be made with a bias seam,
m
which avoids piecing at the bottom and cuts
to better advantage. The ease with which
these gowns may be laundered recommends
them to many.
Lounging or bath robes are cut after the
same model, being liked as they are less Dulky
than those with pleats or gathers at the top.
White lawn is used, and with a collar of the
same, trimmed on the edge with an insertion
oi Valenciennes lace, and beyond this a ruffle
of the plain lawn or of embroidery is very
dainty. A collar wltn embroidery set on with
braiding, through which deucate-colored rib
bons are drawn, is also pretty.
These gowns may be made quite elaborate
by tucking the goods down the back and
front, *nd also tucking the sleeves.
Heavy nightgowns of flannelette or heavy
muslin cannot be better made than in this
style. The collar may be ot china silk for
flannelette gown, to give a dainty touch, for
the silk wears quite as well as the'flsnnelette.
TAKE TIME BY THE FORELOCK.

Though it Is now apparent that the country
may expect no relief from the present Congress
in the matter of raising revenue, there should
be no cessation of the work of preparing a suit
able tariff bill for the consideration of the next
session. The condition of the Government's
finances is the paramount issue before the
country, and there can be no real business
prosperity among our manufacturers until a
proper measure of protection is assured from
foreign competition. And It is time that the
income of the administration should be made
at least equal to its expenditures. The news
of the fixing of dates for hearings on the new
tariff measure is welcome.

a county Asssssor is neglectful of his duty any
citizen of the county may take steps to hays
him punished. The Penal Code says:
In addition to the penalty affixed by express
terms for every nenlect of official duty on the port
of public ofllcersâ State, couiuy, city or townshipâ
where it is not expressly provided, they may, In
the discretion of the court, be removed from office.
person is punishable for the omission to per
form an act where said act has been performed by
another person acting in his behalf and competent
by law to perform it.
WiiTSTâ Homo. City. Whist in America is
eenerUly played under the American Whist
League code. The law quoted recently in
answer to a question from a correspondent
from Livermore was from rioyle, but
recently that law has not been recog
nized by players in the United States
unless by special agreement. Under the laws
of whist as adopted by the league of America
when a trick has once been turned it cannot
again be seen until the play of that deal is
over. The law Is:
When a trick has been turned and quitted it
must not again be seen until after the hand has
been played, A violation of this law subjects the
offender's side to the same penalty as in a case of
a load out of time.
Bigamyâ A. F. L., City. This correspondent
wants an answer to the following question:
A woman married some years ago and had chil
dren after she and ncr husband separated by con
tract In writing. She went to a foreign country
and married another, the second husband eying
In the other country without issue. The woman
returned to the United btates, where the first hus
band was still living, but after ncr return they
sMll lived apart. Properly whose name should
she bearâ that of the first or second husband ?
Should not the children bear the name of the
father ?
The fact that man and wife agree to sepa
rate and live apart, and sign a paper to that
effect, does not give elthei, while both live,
the right to marry again. In the case cited
the woman, in marrying another while her
hushand was still alive, committed bigamy.
Legally she has no other name than that of
her husband. The children by the nrst mar
riage bear the name of the father.
Eyes That Lightâ N. N., City. It Is not
known wiio it was that made use of the expres
sion, "Let me light my pipe at your ladyship's
eyes." It is recorded that during the cele
brated Westminster election in 1784 the beau
tiful Duchess of Devonshire enthusiastically
espoused the cause of Charles James Fox, go
ing so far as to purchase the vote of a bmcher
with a kiss. On one of her canvassing tours,
an Irish dustman paid her a famous compli
ment by saying, "Let me light my pipe at
your ladyship's eyes." The Duchess was de
lighted and often said, "After the dustman's
compliment all others seem Insipid." The
same idea is conveyed by Ben Jonson in his
piny oi "Cynthia's Revels," act V, scene 2:
"Her.â Your cheeks ar. Cupid's bath; he
does light all his torches at your eves and in
structs you how to shoot and wound with
their beams."
STRENGTH-TESTING MACHINES.
Peril in The Tests When Applied to
Blocks of Stone.
One of the most interesting places in the
city of Boston to one of a mechanical turn
of mind is the engineering building of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
and especially that part of it where tests
of strength of different materials are
made. The testing plant is one of the
best in the country, and the test of the
strength of about anything, from twine to
iron columns, can be made. It is not gen
erally known, but it is a fact, that it was
at this plait that the first test of large
beams, columns, etc., for buildings were
made, and as a result of the discoveries
which were made by these tests the build
ing laws all over the world were changed.
The most interesting discoveries were
made with regard to the strength of
wooden beams. Previous to this test the
strength of beams had been figured by
testing small pieces of the same kind of
wood and then calculating the strength of
the beam from the strength shown by
these small sections. In making these
calculations the small pieces which were
tested were taken perfectly clear ard free
of knots, and allowance was made for the
weakening of the beams by the imperfec
tions in them. As a result of the tests
made at the institution on entire beams it
was shown that this allowance was not
nearly large enough and that for some
time beams had been figured on to carry
loads which would bring them danger
ously near their breaking point.
The most imposing figure in the testing
plant at present is the big machine which
is used for crushing and tensile tests. The
machine is an Emery patent and is on
just the same principle as the one at the
Watertown Arsenal, although it is not so
powerful, the latter being the biggest in
the world. The institute's machine has a
strength of only 800,000 pounds, but this is
enough for any tests which are made
there, and, in fact, for the large majority
of the tests which are made at the arsenal.
This machine will crush a great iron
column together endwise in its powerful
grasp or will pull it apart as a confectioner
pulls molasses candy.
More spectacular than such tests as these
are those made on wooden beams, when
the great timbers, after resisting to their
utmost, bend upward and then break with
a tremendous, rending crash. The most
dangerous te-^ts are those made on blocks
of stone, granite especially. A block of
granite will resist almost to its breaking
point without giving any sign, and when
it goes it goes with a report like a small
cannon, and is reduced almost to powder.
The small fragments fly with tremendous
velocity, and it is necessary in making t%
test of this kind to cover the objects with
thick layers of cloth to prevent the wound
ing of the students.
Over in the corner of the basement is
the torsion machine, one of the most in
teresting in the whilÂ« plant. It is pow
erful enough to twist a three-inch bar ot
the finest wrought steel an unlimited
number of times. It is surprising the
extent to which a bar of good material
will twist before breaking. There are at
the institute some bars of Norway iron
which have been twisted round and round
twenty times in a length of six feet, and
the pitch is as even as though it had been
cut with a machine. Domestic iron, on
the contrary, will stand hardly any twist
without breaking. The means by' which
the twist is measured la remarkably inter
esting. Two telescopes are mounted on
the oar before the twisting process is be
gun, and these are sighted on a graduated
scale on the wall across on the other sids
of the -shop, and by this means the
slightest movement of the bar can be read
with the greatest distinctness, it seems
; almost incredible, but it is possible for a
man to take hold of the bar when it has
Men clamped into the machine, and by
twisting it with one hand to produce
movement which is discernible on'the
scale on the wall. â Boston Evening Tran

WeeKs and months were spent each year
in searching for these secret treasures.
Occasionally the enthusiasm would mount
to the heignt of sending far off somewherev
to fetch baclc the "old hunters." k
More than once sucn a one has been per- V
suaded that there was more richness in *
his bullets than he had supposed; and re

silver-lead that he had shot away at deer,

about cavernous bills in fens, bogs and
dismal dens in the deep woods, but only
to the utter disappointment of all tiieir
fond anticipations. The "old hunter"

THE GOLDEN THROAT.
Bell-Like Tones Not Alwaya a Gift of
Nature, but May Be Acquired.
The power of the highest interpretation
of music in song is vouchsafed to but few
favored mortals and is not to be acquired
by any amount of endeavor, if the true
"golden throat." with finely adjusted
chordoe vocales, be lacking, says a writer
in the New York Journal. A voice of
sweet and mellow qnality in speaking,
however, is not always a gracious gift of
nature, but is a possible attainment to
persons of the most ordinary musical
capacity. A prima donna spends scarcely
more time practicing her scales than ait
ambitious actress devotes to the cultiva
tion of a ringing, bell-like intonation to
her sentences, lor public speakers and
people of the theatrical profession under
stand the value of vibrant tones â of the
"thrilling, solemn, proud, pathetic voice,"
whose echoes linger long in the memory J
of the enthralled listener. J
Among well-bred people low voices art*
the rule â low, but not always musical, s
tendency to falsetto marKing any effort
beyond ordinary conversation, which is
simply an evidence of the lack of proper
training, or of a failure to practice those
primary principles of elocution tiiat are a
part of the briefest common-school educa
tion.
Lessons under a teacher are not an abso
lute necessity to the woman who would
secure the grace o f clear, sweet accents.
Deep breathing and chest expansion are
the first steps toward the desired end, and
a systematic course of throat strengthen
ing, combined with enough discernment
to decide between a nasal twang and pure
tone, is about all that is needed to achieve
a fair degree of success.
An excellent method of strengthening
the throat is gargling with cold salt water
in the morning, bathing it at the same
time, first with very hot and then with
very cold water. It thus gets a slight
shock and is braced up and permanently
benefited.
PRIZE POROUS PLASTER.
An Old Lady's Novel Hiding Place for
Money.
Many people have curious hiding places
in which tuey keep their savings, but
there could hardly be a more ingenious or
curious "savings bank" than that which
recently came to light in the provinces.
An old woman who lived alone in a lit
tle cottage was known to have amassed
considerable wealth, and it was also known
that she had no faith in safe deposits and
banKs; but where the old woman kept her
money was a mystery until she came to
die, a few days ago.
Finally, when the body was being pre
pared for burial, a porous plaster on the
old woman's side was noticed, which did
not lie as close to the skin as snch plasters
generally do. When the plaster was re
moved a large number of bans: notes were
found between it and the skin.

with lees light. The deficience is hardly
made up by that derived from the cler
estory roof, lor in a long vehicle measur
ing sixty -five feet there are not more than
live small windows.

The Velodrome track is a bie success.
Of this there is no room for doubt; in
fact, there was hardly room for anything
there yesterday. The immense crowd
present barely left room to turn around,
and the splendid sport furnished left no
room for dissatisfaction.
As early as 1:30 o'clock the people com
menced pouring into the grounds, and
when the races were called at 2:15 there
was not a vacant seat in the stands and
the gallery was packed.
If such an immense crowd will attend a
holiday meet, against such counter attrac
tions as the horse races and the football
game, it goes to show that with the ad
vent of Sunday racing meet promoters
will have a gold mine in the sport.
The day's racing opened with a one
third mile scratch, professional, event.
There were four heats and a iinaj, the,
winners and the fastest two seconds tqÂ£
qualify. The Coast record for the distance .
was 45 seconds, and this was lowered in
every heat, the Dest performance being
;43 3-5, by Hardy Downing of San Jose,
who beat Champion Wells at the same
lime.
Those who qualified for the final were:
W. A. TerrilJ, H. F. Terrili and C. S.
Bay City; Hardy Downing, San
Jose: D. Â£. Whitman, Los Angeles; Allan
N. Jones, Olympic, and 0. L. Stevens
of Ottumwa, lowa. They comprise seven
of the fastest professional riders in the
United States. And here was where the
management made a mistake â in allowing
seven to staft, though it was hardly their
fauit, as two had qualified by riding tie for
the second fastest second place, which
they had not calculated on.
Before they had gone a hundred yards
the Terrill brothers bumped each other,
throwing Harry out of his stride, but he
regained a good position by clever riding.
Wells fell on the west bank and Jones
went over him. Downing', who led all the
way, was first across the lape, though
many thought tnat Harry Terrill, who
came fast on the inside, and wax given
second place, beat him by inches. Stevens
was a good third, and, as he crossed the
tape, fell, dislocatine his shoulder. The
others who Jell were unhurt, but for a few
bruises. The time was :43 3-5, coast rec
ord.

vidine the one-half mile scratch event

thereby qualified for the final, being J. X,

it in 55 seconds as against the former rec
ord of 56.
L. J. Leon won the mile Chinese handi
cap from scratch in 2:581-5; Chan Sing,
150 yards, second. There were three other
starters, and the race was very amusing.
The one-mile handicap professional race
was run in four heats. In the first Wells,
the scratch man, could not catch the limit
men, and Whitman won, Morris second.
Morris was disqualified for looking around
and Boyden got the place. ,
McFarland won the second heat in a
clever ride from scratch. Chapman, who
got second place, was disqualified for foul
riding, and the place went to Slater of
Arizona. , \ ; ;
Foster won the third heat from scratch
in the slow time of 2:23 2-5, Bovee of Texas
a good second.
The fourth heat went to the limit men,
Dow, 80 yards, getting first, Byrne, 70
yards, second. Becker of Minneapolis fell
on the last turn, throwing out "Bob" Ter
rill, who had a good chance for a place.
The final- was as pretty a ride as has
been seen here in many a day. Foster
and McFarland from scratch caught their
field of five in two laps, and then ensued
a pretty play for position for three laps.
Whitman jumped into the lead on the
fifth lap, closely followed by McFarland
and Foster. The latter was in a poor
position, but' the other two rode wide on
the last turn, giving Foster the pole, and
he quickly took the advantage, winning
by a scant half a wheel's length from Mc-
Farland, with Whitman third. The time
was 2:10 3-5. â¢ â Â
Becker's fall in the professional handi
cap incapacitated him from competing in
the shield race, which therefore went to
Dow of Seattle by default. They will race
for its. possession on New Year's day,
however. > Dow rode alone to obtain the
shield, making the unpaced mile *in

CHILDREN'S DINNER
The Little Ones at the Nursery Horn
Had Turkey Galore.
Seventy-two little tots under the special
care of Miss M. E. Wells, matron of the
San Franqisco Nursery for Homeless Chil
dren at 570 Harrison street, sat down to a
sumptuopi Christmas dinner yesterday
afternoon "at 1 o'clock.
; There was an abundance of the Ameri
can bird to satisfy every boy and girl who
perched him or herself round the table
â¢ with Christmas joy and expectation of
having a good time, and when the skele
tons of the, turkeys bad been carried off
to the " boneyard ' "big ' heaped-up" ' dishes
of li iqe-crear^i ,.. were set in ; front of each
child, and- is needless to say â¢ each was
enjoyed. Arferward the youngsters re
tired to the playground J. to gambol about
â as merry. children do on a full stomach. - ;

presides is a ; home ; for "homeless chil

have no parents living, or if living to be
utterly worthless -in ;so far as providing
ior or., looking after their offspring. The
children of such' parents are taken into
the nursery at any , age under 9 years, and"

TWO THOUSAND
EAT FREE TURKEY
Great Success of the Sal
vation Army Christmas
Dinner.
A Spread Fit for the Opulent
Freely Given to the
City's Poor.
One of the Worthiest Charities Ever
Offered to the Deserving of
San Francisco
The Salvation Army Christmas dinner
at the old Athletic Club headquarters, New
Montgomery street, was one of the most
successful spreads ever given by that
organization. It consisted of four sec
tions or relays, with eighteen tables, and
lasted from noon until 3:30 P.M. More
than 1800 people were fed there, and all
expressed great satistaction at their treat
ment and over the bill of fare.
The dinner was quite elaborate, consist
ing of turkey with cranberry sance, roast
veil, vegetables, mashed potatoes, with
tea, coffee or milk, and plumb padding for
dessert.
A feature of the dinner was the excel
lent music by the band from headquarters.
Following this there was an interesting
entertainment under the control of Ensign
Campbell, illustrating the life of Christ
by artistic lantern slides.
Fully six hundred deserving women and
little children parcook of the excellent
dinner and went to bed happier because
of the noble charity of the srmy.
From the very outset everything went
off happily. Nothing occurred to mar the
enjoyment of the guests, and good order
was preserved from the outset. The class
known as "bums" or "professionals" was
not present, except in very rare cases, and
the harder element that came was sober
and orderly.
"The typical hard cases kept away from
us," said Ensign Wood, "and I can truth
fully "say, alter a long experience among
Abe-harder classes, that tnose who came
IwtW yesterday Were mostly of the class
"w&o have been suffering from hard times
fM*her than from vicious habits. They
w*re the genuine victims of misfortune
ans not the failures that come from vice."
The service at the great charity dinner
was perfect, men and women of the army
ministering to the wants of the hungry
poor just as patiently and thoroughly as if
every dinner h/rti been good for a dollar
check at toe casirier's counter.
When tna great rfmititude of nearly 2000
who came hnd "departed satiated, it was
the universal verdict that the dinner was
a great success, and all voiced best wishes
for the Salvation Army.

HALF AN HOUR'S
BUTTLE FOR LIFE
Fisherman Fouish Almost
Drowned in the Cliff
House Surf.
Unknown Bicyclist Disrobed and
Heroically Swam to the
Rescue.
Excited Crowd on the Beach and a
Christmas Catch of Crabs
S ngs Merrily.
Nancio Fouish'a early catch of crabs are
now singing merrily in the bottom of the
sea instead of composing the salads of fes
tive Christmas dinners last evening.
Fouish himself very narrowly escaped fur
nishing his friends with a Christmas
funeral.
Fouish is an Italian crab fisherman, 26
years old. He lives at Vallejo and San
some streets. There is quite a crab fleet
that pulls up its nets early every morn
ing off the Cliff House beach, and Fouish
is one of them. He did not have his
weather eye open yesterday morning and
a sudden high roller of a strong surf, which
was running, wrecked his boat and almost
drowned him. It happened about 9:30
o'clock, and was the sensation of the day
at the Cliff House.
Fouish was busily engaged dragging in
a heavy net when a large wave rose on the
seaward side. He did not see it until its
curling mane was pouring into the boat.
Over went the boat and Fouish and a
large catch of crabs were pitched into the
MC
Surf Is a fickle thing. Sometimes it will
begin to break 200 yards from the shore,
and at other times it will break much
further out. This is what it did yesterday
morning.
Several persons saw the boat capsize,
and soon there was an excited crowd look
ing at Fouish battling for his life. He
clung desperately to the boat, and shouted
in desperate Italian to the people ashore.
Each succeeding wave raised the boat on
high, tossing it about as though it were
nothing but a chip. But it did not ride
the waves smoothly and gracefully as a
chip does. The surf turned it over and
over. Fouish's battle was to keep hold of
the boat. He manaeed to catch the gun
wale with either one or both hands nearly
every time it rolled over. The boat and
man were working slowly toward the
beach. Several times he disappeared alto
gether. Once he was seen to let go his
hold with one hand. The boat had struck
him a terrible blow on the shoulder and
side and disabled one arm.
This was more than the sympathy of
one among the excited crowd ashore
could bear. A young man in a bicycle
suit disrobed. Then he plunged into the
surf to the rescue. He was encouraged by
shouts of "bravol" The boat in the
meantime had been rolled and pushed by
the waves much nearer the shore, and the
brave wheelman reached the exhausted
fisherman not a minute too soon. The
boat was lifted high by a wave carried
aloft on its crest and with the two men
dumped on the sand in shallow water.
In the meantime another wheelman
scorched down the beach drive to the
Golden Gate Park life-saving station.
Captain Varney and a crew of six men
hurried a lifeboat to the scene.
When they anived Fouish lay almost
unconscious on the sand. He was quickly
carried to the life-saving station, given a
drink of liquor from a flask which a saloon
man had donated to the exigencies of the
occasion, and swathed in warm blankets.
He was very sore in the side where the
boat struck him, but no bones were
broken. He went home at noon. Fouish
was struggling in the water fully half an
hour. When taken to the life-saving sta
tion he was so cold and stiff he could not
speak.
The brave wheelman dressed and rode
away. Nobody asked him his name. It
is lost to recognition as completely as
Fouish's crabs were lost to the Christinas
market.

THE SPORTSMAN'S NICHE
Latest Intelligence From the Hunters, Anglers,
Athletes and Oarsmen.
Weather permitting, the lovers of wheel
ing will be well represented to-morrow on
the roads leading into Oakland and Ala
meila. Several runs are announced and
doubtless the cyclists will take advantage
of the present spell of fine weather to take
a constitutional.
Football is booming. Notwithstanding
that the beautiful players of Batte cave
the Olympic lads a good drubbing yester
day, the home team is sanguine of turn
ing the tables on the invaders New Year's
day.
Anglers are wondering when they will
have an opportunity to catch some of the
steelheads, which are a little behind time
this year on their run to spawning
g round s.
Good duck-shooting is reported from the
Alviso marshes, where birds are very
plentiful now. In case the weather re
mains fine sportsmen who fancy quail
shooting should meet with success to
morrow. Lovers of rifle-shooting, hand
ball, coursing and Kindred pastimes are
having first-class sport.
THE WHEELMEN.
Meeting This Evening- to Discuss
Sunday Racing Legislation.
The race meet at tbe Velodrome yester
day was the principal important happen
ing in cycling circles this week, besides
the appointment of the Associated Cycling
Clubs' committees. Ihere is a meeting
to-night, however, which is more impor
tant to the racing branch of the sport than
anything that has occurred in a longtime.
It will be the assemblage of ail the League
of American Wheelmen officials, racers
and all interested in the sport to discuss
the proposition of sending delegates to the
National Assembly at at Albany, >".
V., in February, to fight for the passaze
of a Sunday racin â¢ law. It is plain that
cycle racing in this State can only be
made a success when the meets are held
on Sundays. Saturday afternoon meets
scarcely pay, and there are too few holi
days, and indoor night racing gets monot
onous. But with outdoor Snnday racing
it is expected the sport will draw crowds
s milar to those which used to attend the
ball games in its pa. my days. It is mani
iei-tly to the interest of every racing man,
and particularly the professionals, to at
tend this meeting to-night, and disprove
the article on the â¢'lngratitude of Profes
sional Racing Men" which recently ap
peared in a local cycling stieet, by showing
by their presence that they are nt iea^t
alive to ttieir own needs and are willing
to 'help the local league officials in secur
ing thÂ°m. The meeting has been called
by Frank H. Kerrigan, chief consul, and
Robert M. Welch, memberof the National
racing boar-J of the league, and will D*
held at the rooms of the Bay City Wheel
men, 441 Golden Gate avenue, at 8 o'clock.
J. A. Ostendorf, manager of the local
Cleveland house, is away ou a business
trip through the Northwest. Will Knip
penberg of Los Angeles will return home
in a lew days. Wilbur F. Knapp is back
from his southern trip and reports busi
ness good.
The following are the nominations for
the officers of the Olympic Cluo Wheel
men, made at the last meeting: President,
Charles Albert Adams; vice-president,
Douglass White; secretary. H. V. Scott,
treasurer, George H. Strattoc; captain;
H. U. Hadentetdt; executive committee,
John F. McGiynn, Frank W. Fuller,
' Thomas Spillane.
It did not take Vincent and Kraft, the
coast champion amateur tandem team,
long to consider and accept the callenge
of Smith and Wing of San Jose, as the fol
lowing reply will show:
San FRANCISCO, Dec. 23, 1896.
To ihe Cycling Editor San Francisco Callâ Dear
Sib: Replying to the challenge Issued by
Messrs. Smith and NVing of San Jose, who wish
to race us as a tandem team, we desire to say
that we are willing to race them under the
same conditions which governed tbe Thanks
giving day contest between Messrs. Smith and
Uardenbrouk and ourselves.
As to the date of the proposed contest, we
leave it to be decided by Messrs. Smith and
Wing. If good weather prevails next week,
New Year's day will suit us, but if the weather
will not permit of training, the contest can be
postponed until such, time as the weather con
ditions are iavorable. Rt?spectiully yours, Syd
B. Vincent, Charles Kraft ,Bay City Wheelmen.
The Reliance Club Wheelmen of Oak
land held their annual election last
Wednesday evening, with the following
result: President, E. B. Jerome; secre
tary-treasurer, O. B. Marston; captain, C.
S. Myrick; first lieutenant, B. Neyian;
second lieutenant, H. H. Price; racing
board, E. Griffith, R. Bain, G. Gross.
Tom Cooper, the crack professional, thus
estimates bis earnings for the past season:
Winnings SI7BO. salary $3000, tire salary
$1200, chain retainer $'AH), appearance
moner $500, a grand total of $6680. As
Cooper's business previous to going into
cycle racing was clerking in a country
general merchandise store, it may be seen
that racing with him was a paying invest
ment.
There is a new candidate in the field for
president of American Wheelmen. Al
though no overtures have come from the
gentleman personally, his friends are
poshing his canvass, and in case of a dead
lock in the convention between Sterling
Elliott and Isaac B. Potter, Charles F.
Cossum will doubtless be made to ascend
to the presidency of the big order. Mor
rison is counting on Potter's support, and
Potter will control fifty-six delegates,
which will cut no mean figure when the
ballots are cast. It looks now as though
Potter and Elliott were cut of the race.
The former is bound by a promise to Elli
ott not to oppose him, and Eiliott cannot
possibly be elected without Potter's sup
port. Thus the situation stands.
New York, Philadelphia and Buffalo are
each making a play for the next National
meet of the L. A. W. It seems that New
York is best adapted for the meet. Wheel
men can be well entertained ut Manhattan
Beach, and the "one ana only" New York
is but a short distance awÂ»Â«y. Wheelmen
travel far to attend these annual tourneys
and feel they should have something out
of the ordinary.
Were this tourney to hold the boards in
New York it would be one of the biggest
wheeling demonstrations ever held. Only
1000 visitors were at Louisville during tne
memorable week in August last, but it is
sale to presume that there would be fully
fif y times that number should New York
handle the annual meet and hold it at
Manhattan Beach. Phiindeinhia will
make a good try for it, and Buffalo is sure
to be a strong candidate. The Buffalo
wheelmen know howtoentertaiu, as many
riders have occasion to recall. Toledo,
Obio, is also in the field.
The two principal events to be run at
the Velodrome meet on New Year's day
Nwiil be a five-mile scratch professional
race, run in mile heats, sing.c paced, the
final to be tandem paced, and a one-mile
post amateur race. Both shonld be star
events, particularly the former. Many
wili remember the five-mile champion
ship run at San Jose Saturday, November
9, 1895, which was won by Charley Mur
phy, with Bald second and Tom Cooper
third. It was pronounced the greatest
cycling event si en on the coast, and has
never been equaled. If the race to be run
next Friday is well priced it should be
equally as interesting, as same of the fast
est professionals in the world are aow
riding at the Velodrome.
Walter Foster will race at Pasadena
New Year's day, and expects to retire
after that date, as buriness demands bis
attention. McFarland, Welis and one or
two other professionals would like a
match race with Foster before he retires,
accommodated at the
â¢p4 tiiey may
blue-ribbon meet to be h*id at the Velo
drome, Saturday, January 9.
The Dealers' dub held its annual ban
quet Wednesday evening last, Thomas
ii. B. Varney was tonstmaster, and the
others present were: S. G. Chapman, H.
0. Johnson, P. K. Bernays, Eiward
Christ, W. J. Bryan, John 8. Leavitt and
W. J. Bill, representing the principal
cycle houses of the City. The trade and
the sport in general were discussed at the
table, aud a very instructive and enjoy
able evening was' passed.
The Garden City Cyclers' minstrel en
tertainment will be held Friday evening,
January 29. The date heretofore men
tioned was an error.
It is reported that Eddie Bald will sign
to ride for the same people next year as
be did in 1896. He will con.c to California
the latter part of February. Bald has
found this a profitable winter season. He
laid by $375 daring a week's racing at
New York, evenings, and will probably do
as well at Washington. He is said to have
cleared $12,500 during the year. Jay
Eaton made $450 during the weeK at Madi
son Square Garden, bringing hisjwinnings
for the year up to $5000. This was made
for the most part in indoor racing. The
receipts at the Garden for the week were
$37,000, and the expenses haraly one-third
of that amount.
It was a happy thought which prompted
President A. P. Swain of the Calitornia
Associated Cycling Clubs to appoint as
chairman of the road racing and records
committee of the association Charies Al
bert Adams, president of the Olympic
Club Wheelmen and the Camera Ciuo
Cyclists. Mr. Adams has long been prom
inently identified with the sport here, and
is looked upon as one of its leaders. The
office to which he has been appointed is
one that requires considerable executive
ability and good judgment, and the gen
eral opinion among the club wheelmen is
that President Swain could have made no
better selection than he did. Among his
club mates in the Olympic and Camera
clubs Mr. Adams is very popular, and at
at the annual Olympic Wheelmen's elec
tion next month he is sure of re-election
unanimously, to the presidency. Â:>

BASEBALL.
Santa Claras to Meet the San Fran-
Cisco Athletic Team.
The Santa Clara team will be out in
force to do what is expected of them to
morrow at Central Park. Their team is
made up exclusively 01Â° college boys who
have put in much time practicing and who
will be in first-class condition to give a
warm reception to the boys who represent
the San Francisco Athletic Club. A few
of them played some professional bail last
summer, but it was only as a favor to help
out San Jose for a few games.
The San Francisco club is a little anx
ious aoout it and hope to get one or more
thrown out, but when it comes to a
"showdown" it will be found they are not
quitters if they do get the worst of the
deal. It has been the hope of .those in
charge that no professionals would be
brought into the tournament and that each
team would realize that there are lots of
good players in their class anxious to
play and that they would take advantage
of it. If the San Franciscos put up the
game they did last Sunday against the
Alerts it is safe to say they will not have
the short end of the runs marked ui> on
the blackboard. Below is the line-up:

GUN AND GAME.
Sea- Brant Shooting In Tomales Bay.
Ducks in the Marshes.
If tbe sport on the marshes can be
judged irom the number of wild ducks
that have been seen during the past week
along the bay shores, hunters must be en
joying first-class shooting. According to
statements of sportsmen who returned
from Mount Eden and Alviso last Sunday
several very good bags of birds were made,
notwithstanding that a very light wind
was blowing.
January should be the best month of the
season for duck-shooting in the marshes
that margin the bay. The spoonbills have
arrived in good numbers, and they gen
erally take possession of every pond they
find in the marshes. They are good table
birds when they first arrive, but after a
month or so of leeding in the mud, where
tney shovel up small crabs and shell
fishes, they become coarse and unpalat
able.
According to the weather prophet rain is
near at hand, and in tnat event the duck
shooters should all score markea success
to-morrow.
Ed Ladd, the gun merchant, has sunk
four or live casks iv Richardsons Bay in
the vicinity of the old Sauaalito briuge.
He expects to enjoy excellent canvasoack
shooting from now until the end of the
season. The birds fly over the "sink
boxes" on their journey to aud Irom the
feeding grounds.
Messrs. Leiumer, Brooks, Johnson, Ven
ker and McÃae had a most pleasant out
ing near Antioch last Saturday and Sun
day. Brooks shot a salmon "on tbe
jump," which he presented to John Ber
gt/z, who in turn will back him to shoot
tin cans against Remfree, the champion
"tcan" shooter of Antioch.
Al Truman and his brace of pointers,
Down Charge and Find Him, visited
Tocaloma la>t Sunday. Truman bageed
four quail. He says that he would have
had a great string of birds oiny for the
gun, which was new to him.
"It would not shoot as I wanted it to,"
said Al when relating his experience to
some friends. "You see my gun, winch a
friend had in his possession by mistake, is
an ejector, and once you become attached
to those ejector guns you cannot shoot
any other kind. I shoot very rapidly,
frequently stupping birds five feet .rum
the ground, and to accomplish this trick
long expeiier.ee, backed up by great nerve
power and a quick and accurate eye, is
necessary. I think if I had had my ejector I
would have lowered 'Papa' Casey's record
of 125 straight."
John Kerrigan and W. Lawrence had a
fairly good, shoot on quail Sunday after
noon near Point Reyes. The ground was
too wet for the birds, and as a result shott
ing over points was limited.
Billy Kittle bagged twenty-seven Eng
lish snipe and four robins ou the Coun
try Club's bog.
Al Newman, F. Dolliver and D. McÃae
bagged about two dozen ducks on the
Point Keyes marsh. The birds flew high
and wild.
Al Wilson and Colonel Cracknell of New
York returned from Hamlet, Tomales Bay,
last Monday with twenty-nine sea-brant â
a most delicious table bird.
William b. Simpson, tbe president of
the Jackson Hole Gun Club, who wrote
that fully 20,000 elk had come down irom
the nigh ranges of the Shoshone Mount
ains to the winter feeding grounds, addo
in a later letter that the antelope are so
plen'.iiulin plÂ»ces nnd so tame, owing to
their protection from pothunters, that
they act more like she9p than wiid ani
mals. The early snows in the higher
ranges forced the elk to come to winter
ranges full six weeks earlier than usual,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 26, 1896.
Two Prominent Members of the Never-Defeated V, EGA. Coast
Championship Lightweight Team.
and the citizens of that region, under the
chaperonage of the Jackson Hole Gun
Club, are preparing to s-catter them in or
der that all may have plenty of feed. The
vandalism thai; has been detected in the
Big Horn Range has suddenly ceased
through citizens postine notices that cul
prits caught wouH be hanged.
Twenty thousand elk are down on the
winter range, from 5000 to 7000 more than
in 1894 and 1895, showing under present
statutes for game protection an un
usually large increase. â  Efforts will proo
ably be made to move a part of the lar.-e
band toward the lower end of the valley,
this move having been made necessary
by so large a number coming down from
thirty to fity days earlier tnan usual.
The early and deep snows caused all game
to leave "the mountains. The past season
has shown that officers have been able to
cope with the law-breakers with few ex
ceptions.

THE ANGLER.
Rivera That Are Rapidly Getting
Into Condition for Fishing.
Antrling for steelhends is now in order.
The sport should be good up to the time
of the opening of the trout-fishing season,
which is April 1. Last Sunday there were
many fishermen at Point Reye*, but the
fishes that they longed for never came.
The water was very cloudy and as a con
sequence the salmon roeists retired disap
pointed and disgusted.
January and February are always the
star months of the year at Point Reyes
and Duncan's Mills and if the weather is
not "too moist" anglers can safely count
upon having some good sport steeihead
ing. Tbe only gentleman who held the
lucky wand last Snnday was Colonel
Cooper of the postotlice. Be caught two
nice fish that scaled respectively two
pounds and half a pound.
The Sunday nshernien who landed more
watei than fishes were George Walker,
Frank and George McCrreggor, oteve Rior
dan, Louis Kundeau, Chaplain Terry, P.
l.'utruii, Judge Evans, Frank Jones, Billy
Edwards, John Nolan and F. Cohen.
0 to Bransdorff and his dog Dickey
were the observed of ail observers. Brans
dorfi shoots small dirdswith a parlor rifle,
and an an^ic who was fishing stated that
a bullet from Bransdorff 's little gun hit
bis rod close to the butt. The marksman
will be asked to keep a respectable dis
tance from tbe river in the future, which
request he will doubtless grant the lovers
of angling, as he is a most obliging fellow.
At Larkspur Senator Sid Hall caught a
three-pound steelhead. Louis Miller,
"Rod 1 * McMillan, Billy Shad, Sergeant
Shields and Corporal Parroit fished on the
east side of the "Bath House," but failed
to connect with a fish of larger propor
tions than "a cat." They will try their
luck a^-ain, however.
Bill Cooney was prospecting for steel
heads in the Novato slough, near Ferris'
residence, and meeting with no encour
agement, he sought a mushroom field and
returned home wnh a beautiful basket of
fungi.
Charley Green, Diver John Butler,
Jones aud Morebouse are getting ready
for a trip to Duncan's Mills. John Galla
gher, the champion angler of Oakland,
will leave for Russian River to-day, and if
there are any fish loafing in the deep pools
Galiagher will cause them to "get a move
on," as he thoroughly understands the
knack of catching the gamest of game
fishes.
Professor Jordan of the Stanford Uni
versity, who is the acknowledged au
thority of tnis country on questions that
pertain to fishes, has been frequently
asked whether a steelhead is a salmon
or a trout. The learned gentleman re
plied to one of the questions as follows:
"What are steelheads ?'Mn the lower Co
lumbia, in the spring, there Is found along
with the salmon a large salmon-like fish which
is, or used to be, am! ought to be rejected by
the cauners, Â«nd to which the Astoria fisher
men give the name of Vsteelhead." This fish,
as seen at Astoria, usually weighs from ten to
fifteen pounds.:. Its flesn is pale and its bones
are ha; d. Its general appearance is that of a
lean spent fish, and it sis commonly regarded
as worthless. Although a genuine trout it is
usually mistaken for a salmon, because it is
lamer than most of the kinds of salmon, ex
cept the king salmon or quinnat.
It is supposed that these steelheads in the
Columbia do not ascend the river far nor do
they go far out into the sea, and it is not un
likely that when the salmon go up in the
spring to make ready for spawning in the fall
they meet the steelheads on the return from
their own winter spawning.
For a long time no young steelheads were
received by the. United States Fish Commis
sion, and it was. doubted whether there ever
were any. In other words it was a question
whether the sieelhead was really a distinct
kind of fish, or whether it is simply a brook
trout or rainbow trout, which had descended
to the sea, and taken on an increased growth
and correspondingly different habit. ".
Young steelheads have 01 late years been
taken in the streams near the sea. They are
sufficiently like their parents, and differ in
color and form from - the genuine ralnoow
trout(Salmoirideus). ; It is nevertheless true
that while other kinds of trout and the five
different kinds of Pacific Ocean salmon are
distinguished one from: another by positive
anatomical characters so such difference has
yet been found ' to separate tne rainbow trout
from the steelhead. Their finrays, bones,
scales and . teeth are absolutely alike, . and
nothing except form, size and coloration re
main to separate them. Tf any one expresses
his belief that the steelhead is a sea-run rain
bow or brook trout I know no way to convince
him of his en or. The chances are â¢at least
equal that he is correct. The matter is one
which Dr. Gilbert and ' I hope some time to
clear up. As the typical rainbow trout we
may take the black-spotted trout found in Me-
Cloud River and streams about Mount Shasta.
As the typical steelhead I- take that found in
the lower Columbia.'- The little trout in the
Coast Range have been regarded as rainbow
trout, but they may prove to be young steel
head. â  .
As to the scientific name of the steelheads
your correspondent objects to the name Salmo
gairdnerl and asks who is v Gairdner and who
Richardson, who gave the trout the name of
gairdneri?
In 1836 John Richardson of London finished
his explorations of Arctic ! America and pub
lished his splendid "Fauna Bareali Ameri
cana," in which is given descriptions and fig
ures of all theanimals be found. Dr. Gairdner,
a physician, then living la Astoria, probably
in the employ of the -fur company, first dis
covered the steelhead and sent it with a lot
of other salmon and trout to Richardson.
Even if California and Oregon have forgotten""
Gairdner he is well entitled to whatever honor
the name of the steelhead gives him.
Why are the steelhead trout. md not salmon?
There I are five species of trout in the Pacific
( Ocean. â¢ They are migratory fishes, like the
Atlantic salmon," but they differ from the lat
ter and from all the trout in having a greater
number of rays in the anal , fin, fifteen to
eighteen instead of ten or eleven,'- a .greater
number of inierlisemai bones (bodies at the
base of the rays of the anal), a greater number
of gill-rakers, . of brauchiostegal < rays and of
pvioric glands on the stomach. >, In short, the
Pacific .salmon are built on a much more lib
eral plan, with ; more of all organs in which
the number can be Increased. The salmon
live in -the sea,' spawn in the fall, ascend
streams from March up to the spawning time;
the males grow greatly distorted as spawning
time approaches, and the great majority die
after spawning. The trout take life mure
easily, and spend most of their lives, or all of
it, in iresh water.- ,
The Atlantic salmon is not found in the Pa
cific. It has the anatomy of a trout and the
h a bits of the Pacific salmon. > It, however,
differs from the trout in shedding the teeth on
the roof of the mouth, which all the trout nat
urally keep. What is a salmon trout? In Eng
land there is a large trout (Salmo trutta) which
lives in the river mouths as the steelhead does
here. It is a trout with some' salmon charac
teristics. ' It is not found in America, but the
steelhead resembles ; it. The name (salmon
trout) is used in America for big trout and lit
tle salmon so indiscriminately that when a
man speaks of "salmon trout" we never know
what he means.
Are any of these fish hybrids? I have seen
hybrid trout made by artificial fecundation.
I have not seen yet a hybrid fish of any kind
in Pacific waters. It is sale to say mat no
kind of fish which is common anywhere is
ever a hybrid. : .
What kinds of salmon are there? The five
kinds of Pacific Coast salmon are easily recog
nized, although each one goes through many
stages of growth in the course of its life, and
in all the males are hook-jawed in the fall,
while the young fish aud the females remain
symmetrical. These kinds are: First the
king salmon or quinnat, the largest and most
valuable and the only one usually seen in Cal
ifornia.' Secondâ The blue-back salmon : or
redfisii, smaller and prettier and more com
mon in Alaska. These two run chiefly in the
spring, the other three in the fall. Third â The
silver salmon, the smallest ' kind. : Fourth â
The dog salmon. Fifth â The: hump-backed
salmon. Fishermen use â  these names care
lessly, often calling old males "dog salmon"
and all young salmon "silver salmon." '- .'â ".;
What kinds of trout exist in California? In
England the name trout is given only to the
large-scaled,'" 'â  black-spotted, - fresh-water, or
partly migratory species. Trout thus defined
do not exist in America east of the Rocky
Mountain!, the small-scaled . red-spotted Â» or
white-spotted â  species lou nd in our Eastern
streams being called in Europe , "charr" -or
"salbling." Of true trout California has:
Firstâ rainbow trout, or California brook
trout (Salmo irideus), found from Oregon as
far as San Luis Rey. Secondâ : steelhead
(Salmo. gairdner), in coastwise streams, and
perhaps a modified rainbow trout overgrown
from its salt-water diet. '.Thirdâ Red-throat or
"cut-throat" trout (Salino my kiss). ; This has a
larger mouth, much ; smaller ; scales ; and ; a
deeper dash 01 scarlet uqder; the throat. This
is found from the north .side of Shasta as far
as Kaintschatka. It is not common in Cali
fornia.' : :-'it, â Â«â >;-.: . '-â .â¢-â â â â ', â ..â -.'â  .
The Tahoe trout is a land-locked form of the
same fish. â  It is black-spotted on â ' the 'belly as
well as on the back. It is : found in -Feather
River and other tributaries of the Sacramento,
as well as in Lake Tahoe. Ido not know what
other lakes and streams contain it, but I pre
sume that it will prove to be the prevailing
trout of La? sen and Modoc counties. It is
named for its . discoverer, Salmo my kiss hen
shawl. It is not regarded as a distinct species,
because it varies |by degrees into the my kiss,
which is the common brook | trout of Oregon.
It is not a hybrid, simpiy a race or tribe of the
other. â - â  â -.â  ':â ,-â  â .-... . \ .._. ._ - : . : . .

THE RING.
Olympic Club Will Inquire Into
Tournament Decisions.
The Olympic Club directors will meet
on Tuesday afternoon. Apart from the
regular business of the session affidavits
from Phil Wand and Alexander Ros
borouKh, who were judges of the late
tournament, will be read. As stated in
yesterday's Call, it is quite probable that
the directors will decide upon givinz
Egan, the boxer who was defeateu,accord
ing to George Green's decision, by Hayes,
a handsome prize. Phil Wand and Alex
ander Rosborough were the judges se
lected. Wand decided in favor of Egan
and Rosborough decided uuon an extra
round, which, under tiie amateur rules, is
not allowed. Green, the referee, instead
oi calling the match a draw, as he should
properly have done, deliberately decided
in favor of Hayes, the contestant, who
scored a lead only in the lnst round, Egan
having had the best of the first, second
and third rounds.
It has been suggested that in future
boxing contests the club select a referee
from some of the outside clubs, who will
not show any partiality.
The sports of this City were not in the
least surprised when tbe news ttiat Peter
Maher had put Steve O'Donnell to sleep
in short order arrived. O'Donnell has
never been recognized as a snecessful
pugilist, but as a boxer he ranks among
the clever men of the land. Manor's
"hoodoo" must have left him, as recently
he has Deen successful in his engage
ments.
A match between Peter and Sharkey
sho'Md prove interesting for a short pe
liod. The contest would not last long, as
Maher would certainly put it onto
Thomas the first opening that would be
offered to him for a .knockout. Suarkev
will never consent to a meeting with
M ft her.
It will be interesting to know what Fitz
simmoDS will say to Dan Stuart when
they meet iv the East relative to mat
mueh-talked-uf finish tight. Corbett has
signed articles and there is hardly a doubt
that Fitz wnl lefuse to attacn his signa
ture to the document.
There are, however, hundreds of people
who will wager money now that the tight
will never take place unless it is decided
under the auspices of some popular ath
letic club.
The result of the Fitzsimmons and
Sharkey mill has paralyzed professional
boxing in this City, aud it is doubuui if
any contest worthy of note will be "pulled
oft" by any of the professional clubs for
some time. It seems as if the club man
agers are never satisfied to let well enough
alone.
Tom Sharkey, the sailor pueilist, is a
fortunate fellow so far as money-making
is concerned. Thomas says thut he never
met a man, excepting Fuzsimmons, who
gave him a hard rub, but according to the
following excerpt irom the Philadelphia
Item Sharkey met his match in Honolulu.
This is how the story is told:
It was in Honolulu during the early part of
1894. Sharkey was theu on the Philadelphia
and whs the pet of the crew, Williams, a tall,
lanky, but superbly built specimen of the
Englishman, was a member of tne crew of the
Nymph, then in Honolulu harbor.
The tight came ufiÂ«oon alter the trouble in
the Hawaiian Islands, caused by the dethrone
ment of Queen Liliuokstlani, when tbe feeling
between Americans and the English was quite
bitter. Consequently, when the fight was
arranged, each bide was determined to win,
and both men went into training in earnest.
When the night of the fkht came the hall in
which ii was held was crowded with sailors,
no outsiders being admitted, except the local
newspaper men aud a few residents of sport
ing proclivities.
When the men entered the ringit looked as
though the Englishman had all the best of it.
Sharkey had a magnificent phys.que, but so
had his opponent, and the advantage of the
latter in height and reach was as apparent as
that of litzsimmons over the sailor. Shar
key, however, was broader across tne shoul
ders, and looked as though he could stand more
punlsnment than could the Englishman.
As soon as the fight began it was evident
that the men were closely matched. Sharkey
did not have any reputation then outside of
the navy, but in mat he was noted for his bull
dog courage aud bis ability to stand punish
ment. The spectators were violent partisans,
and whenever Sharkey lauded on the English
man the Americans would h.>wl with delight, 1
while the Englishmen preserved a dogged si
lence. The next moment this would be re
versed. Williams would reach Sharkey, and
the Englishmen go wild with enthusiasm.
Several times a free fignt between tbe two lac
tions was imminent, but was arrested by the
desire to see the finish.
Round after round was fought, and neither
man had any advantage. By the time the fif
teenth round was reached both principals
were groggy, and it began to look like a sure
draw. Both men were dead game, aud neither
would give up. At the end of the sixteenth
round the referee suggested that the fight be
declared a draw, and both men turned on him
with a snarl aud announced their intention of
staying until one or the other was out. For
four more rounds they fought and at the end
ot the twentieth neither mau could strike a
blow that would injure a 10-year-old Doy.
Their fatigue was so great that they were
hardly able to rise from their chairs without
assistance. In the twenty-first Sharkey cnught
the Englishman a feeble biow on the jaw and
knocked hiM down, but the effort was so great
that he himself fell. I'hey sat on the floor and
glared at each other, but neither was able to
rise, and the fight was declared a draw. Both
men were cruelly punished, their faces and
bodies streaming with blood.
Arrangements were made at once for a re
turn match, but the English ship left two
weeks later, aud the men never met again.

THEIR PLACE OF DEBATE.
Agreement Between StaDford
and the U. C. Will Expire
Ntxt Month.
Stanford Wants to Speak in San J se
Part of the Time, but the
Berkeley ans Obj?ct
Between the orators of the University
of California and the Stanford University
there is a radical difference of opinion
upon a topic of considerable interest to
them. Tbe old agreement between the
two universities concerning the inter
coliegiate debates, as tney are called, will
expire by limitation next month. Tbe
belief is quite common vhat when a new
agreement is in process of formation
Stanford will insist on some new condi
tions.
Students at Berkeley have been In
formed that Stanford is of the opinion that
hereafter some of the debates should be
held at San Jose, alternating with San
Francisco. The ground lor the opinion
is that the influence of the University of
California is very strong in San Francisco
and, while this does not imply that judges
selected in San Francisco would deciddt
otherwise than according to the merits ot
the debate, the advantage of having an
entirely friendly audience is worth con
sidering. The warmth of such an au
dience wards off any frostiness which
might be felt by the orators.
The Berkeley students prefer to nave
the debates take place in San Francisco as
heretofore. They say that there is a
strong Stanford contingent iv San Fran
cisco, bui that there is hardly any follow
ing, comparatively speaking, of the Uni
versity of California at Sin Jose. Pro
pinquity causes local enthusiasm, and
Stan tord is very near to San Jose.
The Stanford paper, tbe Palo Alto, has
Ottered some criticisms concerning cer
tain judges of oratory who have served in
the intercollegiate debates in this City de
ciding concerning the relative oratorical
merits of the two institutions of learning
and has galled Berkleyana a little by in
timating that "the parting of the hair"
has influenced some who have sat to
award me victory. .
During this con trove rsary, which is
liable to be under full headway next
month, the public will have a chance to
judge of the power of the disputants in a
matter which concerns themselves. Very
likely some budding attorney* will first
recommend their abilities to their friends
in this way and latent talents will be
stimulated in a verbal war.
One feature of the controversy is the
claim of the Berkelevans that they have,
by consenting to hold the debates on the
evenings of the annual intercollegiate
field days in this City, eiven the Stanford
students a chance to be fully represented,
for all Stanford is in town thHt nig t.
More than this, it is urged at Berkeley
that really the selection of these date's
has been a disadvantage to the Berkeley
orators, whose attention is much engaged
about the time of the intercoile&iate field
days in the work attendant upon exam
inations, in which Stanford has a gain.
Tbe orators will argue this matter oat
and much eloquence will be exhibited.
Gift of a Battle-Ship.
The gift of the State of Massachusetts to
the battle-ship which bears her name is
not the familiar silver service, but a
bronze statue of Victory, six feet high
and holding a sword in both hands. The
statue has been affixed to the forward
turret, where it will be conspicuous. Some
naval officers are of the opinion that a
silver service is a handier remembrance to
have aboard a warship than a bronze
image. The position of the statue is ques
tioned also, and it is not unanimously
conceded that the turret forms a suitable
pedestal for it. Naval Constructor Bowies
approves both the statue and" its setting,
and makes the very apposite point that
the statue, placed as it is, will always be
in view of the crew, whereas a silver
service would not. No life-preserver or
defensive armor has been prepared for the
Victory. It is intended that she shall
take the chances of battle and marine
mishap and go with the ship.â Harper's

CHRISTMAS DINNER
AT HOPE HALL
How the Volunteers of
America Provide for
Ex-Prisoners.
A Cheery Place PaiDted White
That They May Call Their
Own Home.
Helping Hand Extended to a Goodly
Number Already Since the
Opening.
The headquarters officers of the Volun
teers of America took their Christmas
dinner yesterday in Hope Hall. With the
officers were five of the tenants or bene
ficiaries oi Hope Hall. Two of these latter
were regular tenantB â new men from
prison who have not yet been provided
with occupations in the world whereby
they may beein life again. The other
three were visitors â men who had come to
the hall from prison, remained long
enough to feel the full strength of its
beneficent iniitiem c and had left it to take
a place in the work of tbe world again.
"These men who have been to Hope
Hall seem to look upon it afterward as
their nome ; they love it, and come even
from distances to visit it and as," said
t aptain F. M. Brundage, in charge of the
help and reformation department of the
Volunteers. "Hope Hall," he continued,
"has become an institution, althor h it
has only been in existence .-ince the letter
part of October. It has been the tem
porary home of and given the first help
ing nand to eighteen State prisoners aa
they came from San Quentin or Folsorn.
"Of tnose eighteen uut one has returned
to the bad entirely. Two other* are not
b< having as well as we might wish, but
tbe other fifteen out of eighteen have to
far given every sign of reformation, and
some of them I would uot hesitate so
rtcommend for piace^ of trust, for they
have been tried and proven the good stuff
that is in them.
'Hope Hall is an idea of Ballington
Booth's, and has long been an institution
of great eood in New York. It was in
augurated here upon the occasion of Mrs.
Booth's vi3it last fall."
The nail covers the top floor of the
Volunteers' headquarters building on
Sutler street. It is clean and bright and
provides accommodations or ten men.
There is a bedroom, a dining-room, a
reading or sittinc-rocm and a kitchen.
All 01 them are painted white, from end
to end and alt over, giving the appearance
of great cheermlness. The men are ex
pected to keep the place clean and per
lorm the other neces-ary work incident
I tuereto. Men are there at liberty to come
and go as they piease. They are not re
quired to attend the religious meetings
held nightly in the hall below, unless they
desire. They are required 10 be within
doors at 6 o'clock and lights go out at 10.
"The jilace is not open to the inspection
of tne curious," saiu Captain Brundage.
"Were it so, tnere would be a constant
rua of the merely simpering senti
mentalists offering sympathy and doing
harm generally. The men are allowed to
remain here free of charge so long as they
obey the sirupie rules, until they secure
work, or we secure it for them. They ;;re
not required to take any kind of work of
fered, either. There are some people in
this wo r ld who are canable of takine ad
vantage of a place like this to get very
ugly and hard work done for little or noth
ing. Some such nave been here and some
of the men have gone out and done the
work steadily and uncomplainingly in
their effort to get a start again. We stand
between them and such imposition, how
ever.
"There is ample encouragement for
prcecuting this work," continued the
captain.
"In the first place, a man would not
come here who did not wish to be helped.
The others have their $5 when released
ana make a line for Barbary Coast or
Chinatown. Those who come here are
different and we wish to help them."
A benefit concprt will be given for the
benefit of Hope Hall on Tuesday evening
next, at the Volunteers' Hall on Sutter
street, by the Herman Brandt Amateur
Orchestra.
New Medium of .Exchange.
An American traveler in the island of
Papua says: "Tne basis of exchange is
arrack (Java rum), one-half gallon of
which is reckoned equal to one day's
work at fishing or rattan-cutting. No
money is used. When this nectar of the
Papuan enters a ho:ne every occupation is
dropped, and the ramily devotes all its at
tention with enthusiastic energy to its
consumption.
"Tneir efforts never flag while the rum
lasts or strength remains. The resulting
stupefaction lasts for days, but on recov
ery the family cheerfully proceeds by per
severing industry to acquire the means of
procuring more. Arrack is without a rival
the most villainous intoxicant known,
and Us only competitor in the affections
of the Papuan is roa?t wild nig. Together
they are simply irresis ible."
A new instrument, called the phonendo
scope, enaDles the skillful medical man to
hear the sounds emitted by all the organs
in the human body; the heart, the Junes.
the liver, etc., and discover if they are in a
healthy condition, or otherwise.
FillersPOMIFICAL MASS
* AT THE CATHEDRAL
Archbishop Riordan Offi
ciates in Honor of
Christmas.
An Eloquent Sermon on the Na
tivity Preached by Father
Ramm.
Beautiful Music by Choir and orche3
tra as Part of an Impressive
Celebration.
St. Mary's Cathedral was crowded at
the different morning masses yesterday,
beginning before daybreak, and at tbe
solemn service at 11 a. m., in honor of
Christmas, standing room was hard to
find inside the vestibule doors. Arch
bishop Riordan celebrated a pontifical
mass, and the music was of extraordinary
brilliancy ana beauty.
It was evident to every one who attended
the late mass that most elaborate prepara
tions had been made by Professor Har
rison, leader of the choir, to present
music of celebrated composers With all
possible artistic finish. The soloists were
artists, the music selected was full of in
spiration, for support to the grand organ
there was an orchestra, and as a back
ground a well-trained choir. Beethoven's
"Kyrie" and "Gloria" was rendered by
the quartet, with choir support and in
strumental accompaniment.
A. Werner sang Adam's "Noel" before
the sermon and the "Sanctus" before the
consecration. Novello's "Adeste Fideles"
was sung by the choir and a choir of little
girls behind the organ, the children's
voices beine intended to represent angels'
singing. Miss Lottie Crawford sang the
soprano solos, Miss Julia Sullivan the alto
parts; the tenors were A. Werner and
Alfred Kelleher and the basso D. M.
Warde.
The altars and sanctuary were beauti
fully decorated. To understand the value
of the greenery and Christmas berries in
reaching i he tine effect that impressed itself
on the congregation one must have an eye
for the rich mural coloring against which
a green carpet was put in contrast as well
as white marble altars and gilt candelabra,
ilpon it all the warm glow of candles
shone, and the ruady beams from tiny
ruby lamps scattered over the altars. As
if to break any formal lines clusters of
palms wers introduced.
More green foliage behind the altar
finils threw out the white tracery
which was hidden behind vases of ever
greens and scarlet flower* and berries.

In tbe course of his sermon Father
Ramni said that since man has had no ex
perience of pure spirits their worship is
e*tremely difficult. Worship is an intel
lectual act, and an act of thewbole being.
In the worship of God man has to make
some image of the Divine Master. Not
alone the intellect but feelings and emo
tions bave a share in it. When feelings
run with the intellect religious acts come
easily. Those feelings are God's giftÂ«, and
he asks men to bring them into his service.
In tbe old law it was only by the direst
punishment that God kept his people to
pure worship.
Long ago there was a lovely virgin, and
she bore a son whose name i< Emmanuel
â God with us. Shepherds and kings,
the lowly and the great, fall in easy adora
tion before him. The difficulty of the
spirituality of worship has oeen temp red
by tbe incarnation. Jesus lives to-day in
every altar; he is there to-day as the
Savior who dwelt upon earth. The doors
ot his temple are always open, inviting
all to enter and fall in adoration of him.
He is not dead, but hveth; for the sins of
men he lives again.
At the conclusion of the mass, Arch
bishop Riordan gave the papal bene

one which deserves much consideration.
Asphyxiation by this means is as deadly
an agency as electricity or strangulation,
and a? the gas would be introduced into
an air-tight cell while the condemned
prisoner was asleep it would unquestion
ably be more painless than either. It
would also do away with the presence of
spectators, which is not the least argu

Tennyson's B.ography.
The authorized family biography of
Tennyson, by his son, will be published
during the course of the coming year.
Tennyson died in October, 1892, more than
four years ago, and his biographers cannot
be accused of heedless haste. It was ru
mored in Eneland some time since that
the book was finished, but that publica
tion was delayed because a great deal of
the matter, especially relating to the
poet's early years, was of such a character
that the biographer felt constrained to
submit it to the approval of individuals
and families concerned. The London
Academy, however, contradicts this re
port and says it is authorized to Bay that
the only cause of delay has been the mag
nitude of the work.â Harper's Weekly.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 26, 1596.
FLOODS OF MELODY
AT ST. INGNATIUS
The Organ Rolled " Like the
Sound of a Great
Amen"
Clarence Eddy Played Many
Brilliant and Telling
Selections.
Christmas Services Were Made Par
ticularly Impressive by Music
and Eloquence.
St. Ignatius Church was crowded at the
three Christmas services. .A t the 5 o'clock
mass the church was very full. This
crowd was largely augmented at the 10:30
mass so that many who were unable to
obtain either seats oi standing room in the
large auditorium, went away. Special
music was performed, the new organ be
ing opened by Clarence Eddy, the eminent
soloist. Mr. Eddy played voluntaries and
some other pieces at the two masses. His
great opportunity was afforded last even
ing when, after vespers, he played a
variety of selections, enough to properly
constitute an organ recital. Mr. Eddy did
not stint his performances and the au
dience did not seem to have enough even
under such circumstances.
Words appropriate to Christmas were
spoken by Rev. Father Calzia at the 10:30
mass. The sanctuary was decorated with
bunches of red holly berries. Back of the
altar a great mass of white lilies made a
pleasing impression upon the spectator.
The solemn mass was made more than
usually impressive by the largo choir of
fifty voices, solo singers and by the great
organ. The mass was celebrated by Rev.
Father Edward Allen, assisted by Fathers
Sardi and Whittle.
The organ was played at the masses
with very excellent effect by Marice
W. O'Connell, the organist of the church.
The solo singers were the following: D.
M. Jones, first tenor; Dr. J. G. Mor
risspy, second tenor: G- Berger, first basso;
G. V. VVood, second basso. Rev. Father
ColtelJi conducted the music.
The preacher. Rev. Father Calzia, read
the first chapter of the gospel according
io St. John. He began his sermon by
wishing everybody a merry Ohistmas.
"We should all ba happy," he said, "for
on this- day was born to us A Savior. And
all the story is said in these words. Joy
should be unbounded. The nations of
the earth, long in darkness, saw the gloom
of night changed into the brilliancy of
eternal day at his coming.
"Christ was born for you and for all
the fallen human race. Oupht not this
alone to cause endless gratitude? Listen !
He says, 'I am the way, the truth and
the light.' Christ is the way and the
truth and the light. He redeemed ihe
world. 'Follow m?,' he said, 'learn to be
meek and humble; learn of me to for
give. Following me you will secure peace
here and happiness hereafter.' What hap
piness that the world possesses such a
teacher I
"Christ came to dispel the darkness, the
misery and the corruption of the pagan
world, and to do away with all errors. 'I
am the truth, 1 he said. All that we bave
to do i 3 to listen to him. Can we hear the
voice of Christ to-day? We can, because
he appointed his vicars, his apostles,
through whom he is continually speaking
to us. We can still hear Christ when we
hear the voice of his preachers and minis
ters, the successors to Peter.
"Christ is not only the way and the
truth; he is the life. There is death of
the body by dissolution; death of the
soul. Christ came to speak of eternal life;
life of the body, life of the soul â eternal
life. We who lollow Christ shall, on the
day of resurrection, arise with him, body
and soul. Chri3t was born for our salva
tion, to be our guide and teacher. But he
cannot have been born for us unless he
is born in us.
"He must live in us. We must be ex
amples of Christ, Is Christ born in you?
Christ is born for you if he is born in you
this day. Bnt if he is not born in you,
what right nave you got to joy and hap
piness this day?"
Ciarence Eddy played at the early mass
"Allelulia," by F. Dubois, as an opening
voluntary, "St. Cecilia," by Batiste, at tbe
offertory, "Priere a Notre Dame," by L.
Boellman, at the communion and the
tinai movement of Guilmant's fifth sonata
at the closing. At the 10:30 mass he
played a prelude by Gabriel Pierne, 'Fiat
Lux" at the offertory, i>y Dubois; "Con
cert Gatz" as a postlude, in minor, by
Louis Thiele, and also as an additional
piece an andante in D, by Alfred Hollins.
The music sung by the cuoir at the early
masses, Maurice W. O'Connell at the or
gan, was as follows: Pastoral, by Mer
cadante, Kyna and Gloria, by Generali;
credo, "Sanctus Benedictus and Agnus
Dei," by Cagliero. At the second mass
the kyrie gloria ana credo from Cerrntis'
mass in C and the sanctus in E flat by
Fauconies and the benediction and agnus
Dei by Alarz were sung.
The great organ proved to be what was
claimed for it. A brief description of the
instrument is as follows:
Two life-sized figures of angels with tram
pets surmount the central columns, while
large urns with blazing torches form the cap
ping of the outer ones. A beautiful console,
containing keyboards, stop-knobs, pistons and
electric contact stands some ten feet in front
of the organ case, whence the organist
can hear to the best advantage. A spacious
recess, immediately behind tbe console, in the
center of the case, affords room for eight or
ten solo singers facing the orcanist, while, on
each side of the console, there is ample room
for a large chorus, ail under his immediate
control. The organ is "of the first magni
tude," having four manuals of sixty-oDe keys
each and a pedal board oi thirty keys. It con
tains eignty-five speaking stops, seventeen
couplers, fourteen adjustable combination pis
tons, fourteen combination pedals, three swell
pedals and over 5000 speaking pipes. The
dimensions of the case are: width, 33 feet;
rtenth, not inclnding console, 18 leet; height,
37JÂ£ feet The key and pedal action are
electro-pneumatic, while the stop action and
wind chests are tubnlar-pneumatlc. It Is
what is called an electric organ, the advant
ages of this sysUm being a perfection of key
touch, whether coupled or alone, and absolute
promptness of response, no matter how re
mote the key may be from the pipes. A four
ounce pressure Is sufficient for any key upon
the manuals.
GOSPEL ARMY
MD THEIR DINNER
Accused of Money-Collect
ing by False Pre
tenses.
Editor Powers Explains Why
Meal-Tickets Were Sold and
Collected.
Brigadier K?pp2l Tells About What
Ha Saw in tbe He dquarters
on Third Street.
There is to be friction between the Sal
vation Army of the General Booth wing
and the Gospel Army, a new orsanization,
born in San Francisco last April. The
Gospel Army people have adopted the
methods of the Salvation Army and a uni
form somewhat like that of the Salvation
ists.
Both organizations pave a Christmas
dinner to the poor yesterday, the Salva
tionists at the corner of New Montgomery
and Howard streets, and the Gospel Army
at tbeir headquarters, the basement of
27}Â£ Third street. It is about this last
mentioaed dinner that the latest chafing
has arisen.
Brigadier Keppel, Major Mclntyre, Ad
jutant Reid and Sergeant Day, on the
way from the turKey feast at the corner of
New Montgomery and Howard streets,
drooped into the Gospel Army basement
to make a friendly Christian call. What
happened there was told to a Call re
porter by the brigadier, as follows:
"I stepped down into the basement and
I asked a boy whom I saw standing thore,
â¢Can't you get a dinner?' He said, 'No,
it costs 15 cents to get in here.' There
were some men there, and there was a
general grumble of complaint that the
dinner was charged for, when money was
collected for the purpose of giving the
meal free to the poor. There were about
seventy-five people in the room, and not
more than a dozen at the tables, which
could seat twenty-four persons at a time.
We did not stay more than live minutes
altogether."
The brigadier proceeded to say that his
organization had been at considerable ex
pense in gettine up a neat card to accom
pany the collection-boxes held by mem
bers of the army for the reception of do
nat.ons of money for a free Christmas din
ner for the poor. Tins card, the brigadier
said, had been copied by the other organi
zation and read as follows:
GOSPEL ARMY.
Â£. McKinstry, Commander; Headquarters 27%
Third street.
Please assist us in getting up a free Christ
mas dinner for the poor of the City.
God loves a cheerful giver.
Help wanted
For Men's Food ana Shelter Home, Woman's
Rescue Home. Children's
Christmas free.
The brigadier added that the similarity
of uniforms on both men and women and
the similarity in the style of the cards
were calculated to, and did, deceive many
people who donated money, etc., under
the impression that they were giving to
the Salvation Array. Merchants had told
his collectors that they had given provis
ions and goods to Gospel Army collectors
under the belief thai liiey were Salvation
ists.
The Gospel people bad no rescue homes
or children's homes, he said, and yet they
made tnat statement on their cards.
While the brigadier and his companions
were in the basement one of General Mc-
Kinstry's lieutenants explained that those
who had bought tickets got the preference
at the first tables and tbat whatever was
leit was given away to the rest of the
crowd. He explained further that theie
were some free meals at the first table.
"The people of San Francisco have in
trusted our organization with so much
money," continued Brigadier Keppel,
"that we feel it to be our duty to protect
the public from any such burlesque as the
Gospel Army. Oi course we do not as
sume to be a monopoly. The field for do
ing good is open to every one, but money
should not be extracted from the public
by false pretenses."
General McKinstry had just finished a
fervent prayer in the basement of 27^
Third street prior to going on a sortie in
the street with his band. Several officers
is new uniforms and a bewitching, black
eyed lassie were on the platform with
him. The officers displayed on the front
of their caps in gold embroidered letters
an inch tall the words, "Gospel Army."
The general did not appear to be at all
flurried when asked whether he had sold
tickets or had charged anyone 15 cents
or any other sum for admission to the
dinner.
"Ask any of those people here," he
said, waving his hand over the congrega
tion, "whether they had to pay a cent.
We adver ised the dinner to beein at 3
p. m. and end at 6p. M., but we started it
at 2:30 p. m. and Kept it up till 7. Nobody
was allowed to go away hungry."
The general had to sally forth at that
moment, and he turned the reporter over
to Captain J. W. Powers, editor of the
Warrior, the official organ of the Gospel
Army. The captain possesses a brogue,
rich, rare and redolent of the Blarney
stone, and he heaved a sad sigh when told
of the charges made against his organiza
tion.
("There's a great deal of un-Cbristian
jealousy," he said, "among little organi
zations that are working for the (rood of
mankind, -and it is strange bow they try
to pull one :'- another apart, us like * bull
dogs. â  We have nothing to conceal in the
matter. Here are the tickets we collected.
; ; ; "They were sold by us to merchants and
other business men who gave .them away
to poor people of their acquaintance or to
poor men who accosted them: on - the
street and asked for alms. This story of
our .charging t for the : Christmas dinner
was gotten up by the same people no
hire men to attend our meetings for the
purpose ot raising disturbances in them.
In every falsehood there must be a grain
of truth, ami the grain of truth; in the
falsehood about these ticsets is that tbe
general told me it would be no more tban
proper courtesy to the business men who
bad bought and distributed â¢â  those tickets
to reserve the first table for ticket holders,
in order that no man with a ticket might
be disappointed. 'â â .'. ..' â¢ â â¢ > â¢ -
"After Â«,hat every man was admitted to
the tables without asking him for a cent,
bless God. We kept the tables going till
7 o'clock and every one was fed thai came.
There were 269 at the tables, =of which
only 32 bad tickets and of the 269 that
; were fed 182 were men. 23 women, 25 chil
dren and 7 families. Tnat makes 237 ex
clusive of the ticket-holders. < After each
repast there was a song and praise service
to allow, them an opportunity of digesting

General McKinstry, Commissioner J. D.

McKinstry, Mr. and Mrs. Louthan and
other*. â '-â¢,â¢: â¢â .':..-.:-::.â  v 'â ; â ;â - - â 
"Alas!" added the captain, heaving an
other sigh, "its deplorable that the Salva
tion I Army should attack 'us -in this un-
Christian manner, but that's the way
with all fanatics, and the worst of all are
religious fanatics. Just thins of the du
plicity of -some people! Major Mclntyre
of the Salvation Army came in hereto
day and complimented me on the progress
we were making with so little help. And
then they say such things about us!" /

ticket which caused all the misunder
standing. ,

IT PITCHES BASEBALL.
A Novel Piece of Ordnance Lately In
vented.
A Princeton professor, Mr. Hinton, has
invented and patented a gun which
pitches a baseball which curves in its
flight according to the intentions of the
marksman. Mr. Hinton is an English
man, a graduate of Oxford, -who came to
Princeton from Yokohama, where be had
a boys' school. He wan a constant crick
eter in England and long before he came
to this country had developed an interest
in the American practice of pitching base
balls in curves. When he got to Prince
ton he learned how to doit himself. Then
he determined that the Princeton bats
men needed much more practice than the
pitchers they had could give them, for
pitching curved balls is very hard work
and uses men up. So be set to work to
make a machine that would pitch, and
after a great deal of study and experiment
he seems to have succeeded.
His machine is a gun, the power is pow
der, and it is said to work well, so that it
promises to be as useful to the Princeton
nine as the tackling machine which is
kept in the Princeton gymnasium has
been to the eleven. Thus again ha < intel
lect dispatched a Frankenstein to compete
with human thews and perhaps cheapen
labor. To have invented a pitcher is
great, though the human element in pitch
ers is interesting, and it is likely to be
some time before the machine wholiy
supersedes the man. The spot where the
human element might be eliminated to
advantage is the umpire's place. If, while
his mind is still on sport, Mr. Hinton can
invent an umpire who shall prove accurate
and reliable, and adapted to baseball, foot
ball and prize-fights, he will not only do a
great service to the cause of sport, but
make his own fortune in the process. All
that is wanted of an umpire is accuracy
and prompt action. One with a dial face
and "works" in him, incapable of preju
dice or error, would be ideal. â Harper's

"CHRIST THE KING
AND SAVIOR"
Christmas Service at the
Church of the Ad
vent.
A Pleasing Musical Programme
Rendered by a Powerful
â¢ Choir.
Bishop N chols Preaches From the
Text, "And of His Kingdom
There Is No End."
The Christmas festival service yesterday
morning at the Church of the Advent, on
Eleventh street, was conducted by the
rector, Rev. J. A. Emery, assisted by
Revs. H. B. Monges and Hobart Chet
wood. The Right Rev. William Ford
Nichols, Bishop of the Diocese of Cali
fornia, preached the sermon of the day,
The Beautifully Wreathed aud Garlanded Chancel of St. Luke's Episcopal Church.
and subsequently presided over holy com
munion. The chancel ol" the church was
suitably decorated with ferns, palms and
berries, and pulpit and reading-desk were
similarly adorned with tokens of the sea
son.
The lessons of the day were Isaiah ix
and St. Luke ii, in which the advent of
tbe Savior is respectively prophesied and
narrated. The musical programme was
of the most sumptuous description and
ably rendered by the choir, under the di
rection of Henry KirKe White Jr., George
R. King being tbe organist. Mendelssohn's
processional "Hark! the Herald Angels
Sing" and Avison's beautiful and inspir
ing hymn, "'Shout tbe G.ad Tidings," are
almost too familiar and popular to call for
additional comment. The interpretation
of Soa'per's jubilate, the selection :rom
Redhead and Turk's "Gloria Patri" did
lull justice to the devotional themes of all
these compositions and pave ; atisiactory
evidence of much careful reh-arsal.
The Bishop chose the text ol bis dis
course irom St. Luke, i:33, "And of His
kingdom there is no end." The speaker
said : "Tancred, the very perfect and gen
tle knight, almost 800 years atro, on tbe
eve of the capture of Jerusalem, during
the first crusade, made a night journey
to Bethlehem in order tbat he might plant
tbe standard of tbe Cross near the spot
where Christ was born, witb the tnougbt,
no doubt, that the kingdom which they
were about to establish should have its
birtnday on eronnds made famous by the
birth of the King. I have no doubt that
in the minds of those peop;e there was a
conviction that they were engaged in a
great worn â the founding of an eartnly
kingdom â and it would not be stranjje ii
in their enthusiasm and under such aus
l>i-Â«Â»s, in tbe midst of that vast surging
multitude which swept over the continent
Â«, Lurope, insnired by the shrill cry of
'It God wills it!' tuere wa* a feeling that
tiiis kingiloru wonld be a kingdom lor at
least an time. How sicniheant the ill
fated result! Jerusalem was captured;
tbe Christian stood in the place of the
Turk; the standard of Christ auain floated
over the scenes of Biblical history. But
in less than 100 years that kingdom, owing
to internal di.sensions and outside attach,
had numbered itself amonir the tnines of
the past. It is a striking comment, dear
friend?, on the way in which the world is
wont to misinterpret tnat prophecy which
forms my text." The speaker character
ized as a mistaken ideal tae belief which
endured for centuries, that Christ's king
dom is to find Us fulfillment in the uplift
ing of some really standard pageantry and
royalty. "Let us ask, then," he con
tinued, "what that prophecy m-ant.m -ant. We
turn from tha announcement of the anaei
to the shepherds to that conveyed by Ga
briel to the mother of our Lord. There i?
something of a contrast between the mes
sage carried to those watching ones with
their fl<Â«cks and that carried to the heart
of the Virgin. In each message there
runs the joyous accents of the prophecy
of a Savior and a kingdom. But in the
former tUe Savior wa3 placed first.
"It would appeal more naturally to
those who were themselves in an illustra
tive way saviors of their flocks. In the
message to tbe Virgin, on the contrary,
the sovereign seems to be uppermost. To
the snepberds the emphasis of tbe
Saviour; to the mother the emphasis of
the King. Again, the wise men who ap

proached the manger asked of the King:
'Where is he that is born King of the
Jews? 1 "
There is an implied allegory in this nar
rative. The wise men seek intellectually ;
the sbeouerds are urged by a sense oi
duty, while Mary ia actuated by the love
of humanity in its highest form of ma
ternal love. If then we are to grasp the
eternity of Christ's kingdom, and look be
yond the mists of earthly splendor, we
must go not to the wise men, nor to the
shepherds, but to Mary âto the love
of Christ in the first place and
above all else. We must read
first the message of the kingdom,
before that other blessed revelation of tbe
Savior. But while thus emphasizing the
importance of this point of view, the
speaker warned bis bearers not to ignore
the intellectual and philosophical attitude
typified by tbe wise men of the East. He
showed in this connection tbat tbe out
come of investigation, as exemplified in
tbe famous Oxford movement, could only
be a reactionary movement toward greater
faitb. Tbe highest faculty we know that
tends to the proper appreciation of Christ
is tbe faculty of love, and tbe highest
point to which love can attain is to love
not morally the prophet; not morally tbe
priest, butto love the king.
In practically applying some of these
deductions the Bishop said: "We might
take as illustrations many great move
ments of the present day. There seems
to be a feeling that tbe Christian powers
ought to be very different from what they
are. Where is there to-day the most gun
metal, the greatest magazines of ex
plosives, the most men wearing the uni
form of war? Among Christian nations.
What is the great question of the day?
To make an eastern power treat Chris
tians with ordinary humanity. Here is
one weak and tottering sovereign, as we
are told, who is able to defy the diplomats
and the armies of the world, while per
sisting in his dominion of blood. There
is an element of reason and plausibility in
the question, why cannot Christian na
tions make more Christian history? But
there is no prophecy that Christ's church,
bis religion and his sacraments will ever
be so identified. This was the mistake
thatTancred made of old. The kingdom of
Christ is not an earthly one. There is not
ahintofsucti in Gabriel's message. We
must rather look for it in those evidences
of the Christlike love of some American
martyr who has to choo-e between dis
avowing his religion and a fierce and
brutal death ; in the manner in which you
and I are keeping this festival, true to our
ideals, that our lives may have more love
and life regenerate of that Son of God.
Wars there must be and armies t:>ere must
be; -we cannot see any promise that they
ever will be done away with, but they
have their place in the progress of human
history, and behind it ail there must be
the ideal that it is in tbe world, but not of
the world to mark the onward march of
the kingdom of Christ, of which It is Slid:
'It is not meat and drink, but righteous
ness and peace and joy in the whole
heavens.'"
AT ST. PAUL'S CHURCH.
The New Building Is Tastefully
Adorned for the Christmas
Season.
St. Paul's Church on California street,
near Fillmore, is a handsome new build
ing of red stone, which was designed by
Samuel Newsom, the architect, to ta&e the
place of the old structure.
The beautifully finished nave and chan
cel lend themselves admirably to the arts
of the decorator, and tbe latter has evi
dently taken advantage of his opportuni
ties. Garlands of smilax and evergreens
have been largely used in tbe decoration
of tbe chancel rails, the walls, altar and
the solid stone arches which span the
aisles on either side of tbe church.
Tne new buiiding has been used for its
consecrated purpose no more than three
Sundays prior to yesterday, when the
morning festival was attended by an ex
ceptionally large congiegation. Tbe rec
tor. Rev. VV. M. R"illy, preached a suita
ble sermon from Isaiah ix:6: '"For unto
us a child is born, unto as a son is given :
and tbe government shall be upon his
shoulder, the rod of his oppressor as in
the day of Midian." The music, specially
selected, was rendered by a vested choir of
thirty voices and included Gounod's"Sanc
tus" and Mozart's "Gloria in Excelsis," as
also numbers by Buck, Paxton and Men
delssonn. The ordinary choir was aug
mented by a quartet composed of Miss
Mabel Love, Mrs. Chapelle Henley,
J. H. Desmond aud A. Melvin. The same
programme will be repeated to-morrow
morning, and in the evening a special
service of carols and anthems will take
place.
ST. LUKE'S CHURCH.
The Decorations Here Are of the
Most Artistic Description.
The pretty little Church of St. Luke,
situated on the corner of Clay street and
Van Ness avenue, is among the most taste
fully decorated in the City.
A wealth of floral devices has been lav
ished upon both tbe chancel and the body
of the church. The altar is framed in
evergreens, berries, poinsettias and chrys
anthemums, a large white cross composed
of tbe la-t-named flowers marking its cen
ter. The doors and windows of tbe
church, the christening font, the pulpit
and reading desk had been adorned in
like manner. Tbe candelabra on either
side qi the altar bad been almost, hidden
under the foliage of palms and fernss
wuile tha piliar,s of the cnancel and the
*ide aisles of the church were gracefully
adorned with similar material, festoons

I chancel and were caught up at intervals
alone the walls. The effect of the whole
is eminently becoming and was the sub
ject of admiring comment yesterday-
An elaborate and appropriate musical
programme was attractively rendered at
| the morning service. The "Christus" of
j Mendelssohn, sung by W. H. Smith, W.
T. Andrews and William Neilson, con
stituted one of its most noteworthy fea
tures.
AT ST. JOHN'S CHURCH.
A Programme Presented In Which
Gounod Largely Figures.
The spacious chancel of the Episcopal
Church of St. John the Evangelist, corner
of Fifteenth and Valencia streets, pre
sented a seasonable appearance yesterday
with the assisiance of those floral features
universally called into requisition at
Christmas.
Much taste and artistic skill were shown
in the arrangement and bestowal of par
ticular desi-rns, the altar, pulpit and
reading-aesk having received the lion's
snare of attention. Palms, chrysanthe
mums, ferns, smilax, holly and berries
were displayed in a variety of forms and
in conspicuous positions.
The service yesterday morning was con
ducted by the Rev. Dr. Edward B. Spald
ing, nssisted by Rev. W. A. M. T*reck,
Rev. E. B. Chnrch and tbe Key. Mr. Mead.
The sermon and lessons for the day were
specially selected with a view to the
nature of tne occasion, and were atten
tively followed by a larga congregation.
Gounod was unusually well represented
in a programme of carefully chosen devo
tional music, his popular "Sanciu3,' :
"Benodictus" and "Agnus Dei" being
among its best appreciated numbers. Fol-
lowing are the remaining selections to

TRINITY EPISCOPAL.
Art and Nature Conspire to Make
the Church Attractive.
Nature has been prodigally employed to
add to the charm of the elegant and lux
urioub interior of this popular church at
the corner of Gough and bush streets.
Yellow chrysanthemums, berries, lerng,
palms and branches of pine are conspicu
ous among the decorative features of the
chancel. Wreaths of holly cover the mar
ble pulpit, the christening font and the
reading desk. The handsome marble altar
also supports a framework of green foliage
and chrysanthemums, and the choir stalls
are hun < with festoons of everirreen.
The rector, Rev. George E. Wain, deliv
ered a seaHOMable discourse Defore a large
congregation yesterday morning and tbe
musical exerriges were ably directed by
the organist, Prof. H. J. Stewart. The ef
fective manner in which the various se
lections from Handel's "Messiah" were
interpreted deserve special mention.
Tbe balance of the programme, as already
published, included numbers from Stainer,
Gounod ("Noel") and Mr. Stewart's ov;n
"Te Deum" and "Jubilate" in B flat.
THE CONQUEROR'S TITLE.
Some of tbe Fables That Are Taught
in iÂ£ng;iÃU Schools-
William the Conqueror does not owe his
title of the "Conqueror" to bis victory
(1C66). He was, in fact, not transformed
into a "conqueror" till some years later
not at least till all hopes of Engiish free
dom had at last died in tbe surrender of
Ely in 107 L Further, he was not even then
a conqueror in the ordinary sense, for bo
came only to assert his rights bequeathed
to him, as was the custom in those days,
by Edward the Confessor.
The dreadful chastisement following the
Northern English resistance to the Nor
mans in 1069, and repeated in every school
book, "With fire and sword he (the Con
queror) took a revenge so terrible that
from the Humber to the Tyne there
stretched for almost a century a vast des
olate waste unbroken by the plow" â if we
prefer Professor Freeman's authority,
turns out to be illusive.
Tbe conqueror's son, Rufusâ the greedy,
the merciless, tbe irreligious, the hated
oppressor of all classes â was not acci
dentally shot by an arrow from the bow
of Walter Tyrrell. He was assassinated.
His body bore the marks of three or four
sword thrusts. Almost all tbe authorities
of his time called Tyrrel the "murderer," '
and the fact that he immediately fled
across sea is alone strong presumptive
evidence. Some authorities are actually
of opinion tbat bis younger brother,
Henry, who was in tne New Forest at tne
time, was the instigator of the crime.
The probable motives rest upon the
combination of tbese facts: William
Rufus had desDoiled Henry; the church
and barons were suffering from bis violent
extortions and longing for speedy relief;
tbe eldest brother, Kobert, the rightlul
heir, was opportunely away in the Cru
sades, and the baste with which Herity,
on hearing tbe news, reacied Winchester
to seize ihe treasure, nnd put forward the
lavish promises which alone secured him
the crown (1200), certainly . are inferen
tialiy serviceable to such an opinion. â

MATHIESOH IS
NEXT IN LINE
Came Here to Look After
an Appointment as
Pilot.
Stepson of the Man Whom
He Wishes to Succeed
Next Month.
Sad Predicament of the Army Officers
on the McDowell Christ
mas Eve.
Captain Matthieson ot the barkentine
Catherine Sudden was made happy last
week. He is almost- certain of receiving
the appointment of pilot to fill the place
made vacant by the resignation of his
siepfather, Captain Jones. So sure is he
of receiving the position that be came to
Fan Francisco on the Corona from San
Diego yesterdaj' and his vessel is now on
her way to Grays Harbor in charge of
Captain Anderson, the chief officer.
Nearly three months at-o Captain Jones
disappeared. The pilots and Pilot Com
missioners searched high and low for him,
but no trace of him could be found. His
stepson was notified aud be made a dili
gent search, but failed. Finally word
came from Livermore that Captain Jones
bad wandered past there in a condition
bordering on insanity. His friends took
him in hand and finally got him back to
this City. Next day ne decided to give
up the sea, and consequently there was a
vacancy in the Board of Pilots.
Half a dozen captains were anxious to
secure the position, but during the last
week or so the contest narrowed down to
a fight between Captain Mathieson and
Captain Hall, late of the Corona. The
former was first in tbe field and had se
cured the backing of all the pilots before
Hall entered the contest. A great lactor
in the making of the appointment is the
fact that Mathieson has promised tbe
Pilot Commissioners that he will pay Mrs.
Jonss (bis mother) a percentage of his
salary every month. He is one of the
b tit-known skippers tbat comes into this
port.
"Bob" Spear, tbe boatman, was in trou
ble again yesterday. He and Joe Keating
took a consignment of Christmas goods
out to the Monadnock. Bob stood up to
wave his greetings to the men on the war
ship, and'then came his Waterloo. The
Southern Pacific's freight steamer Transit
was passing at the time, and the wash
from her wheels raised sucn a disturbance
that Spear's boat nearly capsized and he
was thrown overboard while in the pro
cess of saying "A merry Christmas."
Spear was washed under the counter of
the Monadnock, and had it not been for
the presence of mind of Keating, who
pulled him out in the nick of time, he
would not now be awaiting tbe coming of
"a happy new year."
The quartermaster's ateamer General
McDowell was again in trouble last Thurs
day night. Leading Alcatraz Islsnd the
mooring line caught in the propeller and
for half an hour the vessel drifted around
in a helpless condition. Finally tne cap
tain decided to anchor and then signaled
the island. Word was telephoned to the
City and the tug Sea Queen was sent over
to help out the McDowell. It being Christ
mas eve there was a big crowd on the
McDowell and the consequence was that
all were hours late in getting home to
ttieir Christmas trees. The Sea Q.ieen
first of all took the passengers to Angel
Island, Black Point and the Presidio, and
tnen went back to the McDowell and
towed her to Clay-street wharf. During;
the night tbe rope was cut out of tbe
steamers wheel and yesterday she was
running as usual.
Tbe American ships in port made a poor
showing on the front yesterday. Tbe
Oceanic, Pacific Coast and Pacific Mail
Steamship companies had all the vessels
owned by them decked with flags and
evergreens, but the otber American ves
sels in port in many instances did not
even fly the stars and stripes. The Tropic
Bird was a notable instance to the con
trary. Th;i entire crew had been given
shore liberty, but nevertheless Captain
Jackson went to work and hung out all
the ship's bunting blmsalf. The Aus
tralia, Mariposa and Zealandia, at Pacific
street wnarf, made a splendid appearance
and Captain Howard saw to it tnat every
man in his employ had a merry
Christmas.
Model Cities.
It has been pointed out that New York
m:giu advantageously study the condi
tions of Glasgow, Manchester, and other
British and Continental cities to which
scientific methods of administration have
Deen applied, with the result tbat the
franchises pay all running expenses, witb
a surplus over. They own and run their
own tramways, gas works, and partly
(Glasgow entirely) their water works and
electric plants, with the result that fares
are reduced in some cases as low as two
cents, gas and water bills cut in two, the
city lights the streets, squares and public
buildines free, leaving a surpiu,s revenue
from these sources, while the tax rate is
reduced to a fraction of what it was.
A like result would follow in New York
if it could only recover control of its own
legitimate business, thrown away by the
ignorance and knavery of those who used
to rule it. â Pearson's Weekly.

IF MARRIED
Miss Rust Wedded an Old
Man for His
Property.
He Got Well and Repaid Her
Sympathy With All Manner
of Meanness.
Finally He Died and His Half-Million
Dollar Estate Cannot Be
Located.
Oaxlakd Office Ban Fbajcchoo Call,}
908 Broadway, Dec. 25. f
A well-known and respected resident of
this city for many years past took her de
parture to-day to another city to forget
troubles that have made her life one of
sadness for a period of nearly two years.
Like tbe cynic who asked "Is marriage
a failure?" she has reasons to believe that
some marriages are not made in heaven,
as her own proved. Her story reads more
like fiction than fact.
Among the first-class seamstresses of
L>akland for many years was a neat-
Jbpearing lady of perhaps 35 yeara of age
named Miss Rust who earned a comfort
able living by sewing for wealthy Oakland
families. Her home consisted of two
cheap but cozy rooms in a Sixth-street
lodging- nouse.
She was not a selfish person and almost
every evening was spent in Marshall's
Undenominational Mission on Eighth
street, trying to help with the good work.
Her sorrows date back to one unfortun
ate night when listening to the street ser
vices of the Salvation Army, in company
with a friend aud some children. These
children were attracted by the attentions
of an old gentleman disposed to be very
friendly to them, until he got into conver
sation casually with Miss Bust and her
f-iend.
The old man resembled the pictures of
Santa Claus and was evidently nearly
seventy years of age. Nothing was
thought of the meeting until the aged
man became a regular attendant at the
mission and always tried to be very court
eous to Miss Rust.
The old gentleman was named Wright,
and he was a widower. He gave Mis-
Rust to understand that he was rich and
lonely.
From escorting her home he began to
call. Finally came a proposal of mar
riage and a decided refusal, but this only
made the aged lover more determined.
He dogged her footsteps and begged that
she would marry him, telling her that if
would only consent he would make
her a deed of gift to all his Oakland, San
Francisco and San Diego property, claim
ing that it amounted in value to $500,
-000.
Then he fell very ill, the doctor said he
was sick unto death, and his last wish was
that Miss Rust would become his wife, to
inherit his wealth, in proof of his great af
fection for her.
Like a cautious woman she repudiated
the offer, and some of her best friends
thought it unwise, as poor old Mr. Wrieht
was dying and he would leave her a young
widow, well fixed for the remainder of her
life. She went to his bedside at his
i urgent request and with a feeble voice ne
ppromised if she would only grant his wish
he would die contented.
He promised to faithfully to die Imme
diately that sympathy got tbe better of
her judgment and a minister from tde
Thirty-fourth-street Metuodist Church,
where she was a member, came in and
made them man and wife.
Being conscientious, the young bride
set about to nurse her supposed dying
husband. But instead of taking his de
parture to the better world he daily gained
in strength and health until he was as
well as ever. Instead of a devoted saint
he became a tyrannical husband, requir
ing his wife to wait on him, allowing her
no freedom or money, and the woman
suffered k enly. She bore it for two
years, when the old man took the grip
and one night died, and Mrs. WrL-nt,
with no pretense of sorrow, laid him away
in Mountain View, paying for everything
from her own savings before marriage.
Then came the search for a will, deeds
or property, but none were found, only
pension papers entitling Wright to $10 a
month.
Records were next looked into, but his
name was not found on tbe books; then
the tax office was visited, but nothing was
there to show that Wright had ever owned
a piece of Oakland property. San Diego
end ban Francisco offices were communi
cated with and the results wÂ«re the same,
and Mrs. Wright soon discovered she had
been duped.
She does not intend to return to Oak
land. _ ________^____
A FALLEN BASON.
He Is Even Deprived of His Title of
Constable.
OAKLAND. Cal., Dec. 25.â Constable
yon Kapff of Alameda has revoked the
appointment of "Baron" Baroteau as a
deputy. He discovered that if he allowed
the "baron" to continue wearing a star
he might juÃt as well throw up his office
and quit. According to Yon Kapff, Baro
teau wanted to run the affairs not only of
the Alameda constables but of those who
hold forth in Oakland as well.
He ignored his principal entirely and
undertook to handle all of the civil busi
ness that was lying around loose. He waÃ
serving papers in all of the surrounding
towns and when the other constables ran
across him they began to raise a howl.
Baroteau was appointed for the purpose
of acting as keeper on a ranch near Dublin.

DANISH WEST INDIES.
Three Islands Which This Country
Might Purchase if It Would.
The result of the Presidential election
in the United States ha* been eagerly
looked for by tne population of the
Danish islands in the West Indies since
the Republican convention in St. Louis
last summer, which made the purchase
from Denmark of these islands a para
graph in its platform. The population is
not discontented with the present Govern
ment, which is as free as possible, but it
is a known fact that Denmark would not
object to sell the islands, which, on ac
count of the. distance from thÂ« mother
country and the difference in climate,
have no such value for the Danish crown
that their maintenance is of any import
ance.
The time has passed when Denmark was
one of the greatest naval powers, and it is
not nece-sary now, considering the neu
tral position of Denmark in the European
concert, to maintain any especially Dan
ish naval station in the West Indian
waters. Once in a while the people of the
islands have been alaimed by rumors that
Denmark was about to sell the islands to
Germany, a trans-action that would cause
general dissatisfaction, and they therefore
will bail the day when they can change
"Old Dannebrog" for "Old Glory," know
ing that the question of ownership will
then be settled forever and the islands be
long to that country to which they natu
rally ought to belong.
The islands have been under the Danish
crown since 1655. but have now their own
government, consisting of a Governor (ap
pointed by the King of Denmark) and
two Colonial Councils (one for St. Croix
and one for St. Thomas and St. Juan),
whose members for tne greater part are
elected by the people. The slave trade
was prohibited by the King .of Denmark
in 1803 and slavery was abolished in 1856.
Of this population 5000 are white â mostly
Danes and English â whiie the balance are
colored. The language is English and the
religion Lutheran, Catholic, Methodist
and a few Jews. Tne islands have their
own Court ot Appeals, but cases for the
Supreme Court are decided before the
Danish Supreme Court in Copenhagen.
Nearly thirty-six years ago Denmark
agreed to sell the islands to the United
States for $8,000,000, but the Senate at
Washington failed to approve the treaty,
which accordingly became void. â New

FOUND, A LOST LOBSTER
A Remnant of the Crustacea
That Were Planted in
Monterey Bay.
How Tbe Scientist Sought tor Him.
Tales tbe Men of the Sea
Have Told.
One of the lost tribe of Eastern lobsters
that was planted in Monterey Bay about
twenty years ago lias been found and the
epicures may rejoice thereat. When the
luscious Crustacea were dumped overboard
by the United States Fish Commissioner
and told to multiply till every inlet on the
Pacific Coast would teem with its increase,
the oyster opened his shell and laughed
in glee, the clam bade good by to the
chowder-pot and tne crab clapped his
double bank of claws for joy of it.
That lobsterâ the ward of the scientist,
tbe emigrant turned loose in California
waters â would take their places in the
market-stalls and they would wicgle
through the marine deeps in peace. Their
names woutd never again appear on the
free-lunch menu.
But that lobster was not to be caught
napping, nor in any other somnolent con
dition. He had been trapped once lar
away in his Atlantic bed and consequently
he made good use of his newly found
freedom.
He burrowed deep down in the loam of
the ocean and became only a dim and
Jast-lading memory. Wild story-tellers
of the stormy sea came ashore and said
that they had seen him. During their
shipwrecks when they were sin Wing be
neath the billows they had interviewed
the lost lobster. He was cruising in com
pan-v with the mystical serpent, and out
of the depths they arose to tell the tale.
One weird old man of the ocean said
that when he was once banqueting with
a crew of mermen a thousand fathoms
below the waves he had eaten salad made
from the wily crustacean, and that sailor
man hitched up his trousers in a convinc
ing sailor-like way.
Many people believed the yarn and the
scientists boarded their boats and dragged
their deep-sea nets over the alleged
haunts of that lobster in the hope of
gathering him from his submarine seclu
sion, and the menu of the mermen.
Others not so wise in tbe curious things of
the ocean wagged their skeptical heads
and remarked in their whiskers that
those narrators had evidently been flound.
ering in grog instead of brine, and the
wild shipwrecking gales they had encoun
tered blew only along the terra firma of
the water front, and also that the rare
salad of the mermen was only a dream
dreamed in the lockup after a roaring
cruise along the stormy Barbary Coast.
Albeit, the lost lobster has been found.
He didn't travel with the sea serpent, he
didn't turn to cold salad for the menu of
the mermen and he didn't go glimmering
through a dream of things that were. He
went to Oakland.
Many mystical things go to Oaklandâ at
least they are found there, as was the lost
lobster yesterday, by a clam digger.
The scientists might never think of
i looking for anything remarkable in Oak
land, so he escaped their drag-nets for
twenty year? and slept like Rip Van Win
kle in peace, while his brothers, tue crab
and the shrimp, went one by one to the
bill-of-fare.
E. L. Rushmer, a lad of this city, was
shoveling in a clam bed in the creek near
I the Peralta slip for the piece de resistance
I of a Christmas bake whpn be turned up
one of the transplanted Eastern lobsters.
It was about three inches long and is
undoubtedly one of the lobsters dumped
into Monterey Bay years ago by the
United States Fish Commission. They
disappeared and it was thought that the
plant was a failure, that either the water
of the Pacific was unsuitable for the
Atlantic-bred crustaceans or that they
had been destroyed by their voracious
enemies in the ocean.
This one got into Oakland Creek and
evidently was safe from foes within and
without the sea. Even the scientist of the
Athens of the Pacific never dreamed of his
presence there. If he na>l gotten down to
Palo Alto, now, David Â£tarr Jordan would
have caught him. That lobster was wise
in his generation.
A BARBEL PIDDLE.
Peculiar Magical Instrument Made by
a Massachusetts Man.
H. H. Hustis Jr., assistant station agent
at Prospect Hill, East Somerville, on the
southern division of the Boston and Maine
Railroad, is something of a genius in the
musical line, says the Boston Globe.
When bis soul yearned fora fiddle he set
about and made one out of a half barrel.
Surprising as it may . seem at â :: first
thought, the fiddle has a vory good tone,
it is especially strong on the baas. 'Cello
strings are used. |
Mr. Hustis is a violinist of some merit,
and when he takes his violin to the station
he and G. K. Walcott, the station agent,
make music that is highly entertaining to
those who hear them.: Mr. Walcott plays
the barrel bull fiddle very ; well, consider
ing that he is' left-handed, and the rotund
instrument is strung right-handed.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 26, 1896.
THEY STUDIED
THE VERB "AMARE"
Love and Latin at the
University of Cali
fornia.
Fred W. Koch, 96', and Miss
Amanda Krenz, '96, Will
Soon Be Wedded.
The Prospective Groom a Track
Athlete cf Unusually Wide
Reputation.
BERKELEY, Cal., Dec. 25.â The most
notable engagement in university circles
which has taken place in many months is
that of Fred W. Koch, '96, one of the best
known track athletes west of the Rocky
Mountains, and Miss Amanda Krenz, a
FRED W. KOCH AND MISS AMANDA KRENZ,
Both Recent Graduates of the State University, Whose Engagement
Has Been Announced*
recent graduate of widespread popularity.
Miss Krenz lives in Napa, while Mr.
Koch, whose home is at Escondido, 3an
Diego County, is teaching science at tbe
Merced High School.
Every effort was made to keep the be
trothal a secret until the prospective bride
and groom were prepared to announce it
in the regular manner, but despite their
desire for secrecy it crept out and soon
spread like wildfire throughout the com
munity.
What adds special interest to the en
gagement is the fact that the groom to be,
while in college, carried off more student
hjpnors than any one for many years, be
sides being a prominent member of the Phi
Delta Theta fraternity, whiie the pros
pective bride, being affiliated with the
Kappa Alpha Theta Sorority, completed
the classical course in three and a half
years. Koch also completed his course In
three and a half years, having taken the
degree B.S. last January, while Miss
Krenz received the degree A. B. only last
Tuesday.
What gives Koch a special place among
the graduates of the institution is his won
deriul athletic record, having won during
his course t irty-uine gold and silver
medals, besides being captain of the Cali
fornia team which went East in May, 1895.
During their trip he carried off more bon
ois than any other two men on the team.
In his freshman year he was elected
"Bourdon president," which is considered
the highest class honor at the university
save the editorship of the Blue and tiuld,
and successfully conducted the obsequies
attending the burial of Bourdon and
Minto in one of the hardest-fought class
battles < ver carried on at Berkeley.
Throughout bis course he was identified
with nearly every movement of interest to
the student body.
Having won fame as a student and an
athlete, when it came to the selection of a
man to lead tbe Berkeley team against the
Eastern cracks Koch won the place
handily. The remarkable feature of bis
athletic ability was his fitness for so many
different events. In ordinary fie;d days
he would cuter thÂ»i quartet-miie, the half
mile, the high jump, the shot-put and the
broad jump. For a time he held the Uni
versity records in all of these events.
His records of 50 3-5 seconds for the
quarter-mile and 2 minutes 1 1-5 seconds
for the half-mile remain unbroken on the
coast to-day.
After graduating from the university he
spent several months of special study in
the department of botany, when he re
ceived the appointment to tbe position he
now holds.
No date has been definitely announced
for the wedding, but It is understood that
it will take place either in the spring or
early summer.
Will Plead Guilty.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Dec. 25.â H. J. Cro
nin, wanted on four charges of embezzle
ment preferred by his former employer,
A. T. Newih, was arrested in a saloon on
the county road last night and locked up
in the city prison. Ho drove a milk
wagon and collected money from his cus
tomers, but failed to turn the money over
to the owner. When detected he was dis
charged, and later warrants were sworn
out for his arrest.
When questioned by a Call representa
tive ibis afternoon Cronin was not at ail
cheerfully inclined. "I have nothing to
say," said he when questioned. "I will
plead guilty and be done with it. There
is no use in denying the charges, for I bad
no excuse for acting as I did. I'll take
my medicine."
They Will Build.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Dec. 25.â 0n January
1, ClarK & Sons will put on a full force of
men in their terra cotta work- and begin
the erection of a three-story addition to
their present works. The building will be
84x120 feet. The firm are now at work on
the manufacturing of fire brick for the new
ferry depot in San Francisco.
Death to the Doga.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Dec. 25.â Not con
tent with stealing the most valuable
canine pets of this place, some one has be
gun poisoning them. To-day the police
were notified that a valuable dog belong
ing to a resident on Railroad avenue had
been poisoned last night. The police de
ciare that the thieves who have been
operating in this city are residents of tiie
place, and know where to fine* the ani
mals that are of the most value. They
would not be surprised to learn that the
parties who poisoned the dog are the
same that have been at work here.
New High School.
ALAMEDA, Cal,, pec. 25.â One of the
pressing needs of tnis city is a new high
scnool building. Witn the present gram
mar schools the lower grades are well
cared for, but the scholars preparing for
the university are sadly crowded for room.
Superintendent Sullivan is outspoken on
tbe subject, and declares that some step
must be taken to care for the coming
classes, which are growing larger each
year. Witn the best of all the accredited
schools in the State, it is considered that
room for them must be provided.
CHINESE SCHOOLBOY.
Hard Regime of the Youngs ten in the
Flowery Kingdom.}
The Chinese school children have in
stilled into them at an early age habits
of hara, steady study, says the London
Mail. At the age of 5 a boy begins his
schooling. At daylight he rises, and, after
dressing as quickly as possible, he starts
breakfastless to school. He is given a
task and after it is completed he ia allowed
an hour for breakfast. Again, later, he
has an hour for luncheon, but he is at his
study nearly twelve hours a day seven
days in the week.
All the time that be is not Baying his
lessons he is learning alond at the top of
his voice. He is taught rudimentary as
tronomy, physics and natural history, but
greater stress is put upon writing and his
literary studies than upon any other
branch.
"A Thousand Letters," a poem, is the
study that forms the backbone of his lit
erary education. In it are taught tbe
duties of children to parents and all such
matters. Whatever ti>e study may be^ â
history, classics or scienceâ every lesson is
learned and repeated word for word.

CHRISTMAS BELLS
ACROSS THE BAY
How the Great Festival
Was Celebrated in
Oakland.
Convicted Murderers and Thieves
Hold Service in the County
Jail.
Innocent Little Children Sang Carols
Before tbe Christmas Sun
Arose.
Oakland Office San Fbancibco Call,}
908 Broadway, Dec. 25. |
Christmas was observed v^ry generally
in Oakland. Charitable institutions,
churches, jails and missions all observed
the day.
Perhaps one of the most unusual gath
erings was at the County Jail, where the
birth of the author ol Christianity was
celebrated with fervor and earnestness.
Sheriff White, although an agnostic, per
sonally places every courtesy at the dis
posal of those Christian workers wno care
fully observe the rules of the jail.
Under his shrievalty the various mis
sions have done much good work, but tbe
largest number of converts have been
made by the Salvation Army.
At the service held this morning, C. R.
Bennett, wbo was one secretary of the So
ciety for the Suppression of Vice and who
i3in jaii for snooting at George Gray,
knelt by the side of Ben Hill, who shot
his wiie; John Martin, a burglar, and
William Morriss, W. Taylor, M. Connolly
and John Taylor, also burglars, were
praying with Louis Muhlner, who killed
Jennie Lewis, and all these men claim to
be sincere Christians. They are certainly
among the very best behaved of the pris
oners, and Sheriff White would be only
too glad to see them all converted. When
Louis Muhlner goes to San Quentin he
will find a convict Salvation Army corps
there, so he will not be lonely.
The Sheriff furnished a good dinner for
his guests, and at the City Prison the in
mates were likewise well attended to.
At the West Oakland Home ninety-six
little children woke up early this morning
and rushed to their stockings, to find
them well filled. Thirty other little tots,
who do not know stockings from night
caps, were also remembered in a manner
suitable to their years.
The inmates of the Home for Adult
Blind were specially treated by Colonel
Jack Hays, the superintendent.
The festival of Christmas will be cele
brated at most of the churches next Sun
day.
The little carolers from Etnemere, the
residence of the Hushes at Fruitvale, car
ried out their programme before sunrise
as outlined in Wednesday's Call. They
came to Oakland on a special car and sang
beneath the windows of resiliences on
Jackson street, and their efforts were
greatly enjoyed.
A LUCKY PENNSYLVANIAN.
Salt of Butternut Colored Clothe*
Helped Him Oat of Libby Prison.
''There was an odd fellow, a Pennsyl
vanian, on our floor in Libby prison,"
said Colonel Richardson. "He was tail,
angular, stoop-shouldered and had the
regular North Carolina dialect. Nearly
everybody liked him and all talked with
him. He had been a prisoner some time;
his suit of blue had become a bunch of
rags. By some means ho managed to get
a new suit of butternut-colored clothes,
and after that we called him 'Old North
Carolina. 1 One of tne prisdners asked him
when he was going to join his 'tar-heel'
regiment.
" 'You jest wait and watch.'
"In those days it was a common thing
for citizens to accompany Major Dicfc
Turner, who had charge of Libby prison,
on visits to the prisoners. One afternoon
half a dozen citizens of Richmond wern
with him and when they marched out our
'tar-heel' soldier fell in and went with
them. He was standing by the door in
Major Turner's room when that officer,
noticing him, asked: 'Well, sir, what do
yon want here?'
" 'Oh, nothin' in particular; Jest thought
I'd Jook around tne prison a little.'
" 'Well, you can't look around the
prison a little, and you had better move
on.'
"But Cupps â that was his name â stood
there looking as innocent as a boy on his
first visit to town, when Turner lost his
patience and said: 'Coma, move on 1 Get
out of here!' and gave him a push into the
street.
'â¢As Cupps passed out into the road
where we could see him from our windows
he took off his hat, made a low bow and
started on a gentle shamble out of town.
He made his escape. After that there was
a great demand for butternut suits, but no
more could be smuggled into the prison."

There Always Have Been Lubbers.
This word is in "Ralph Roister Doister,"
circa 1550, 111., 3:
And where he is louted and laughed to scorn,
For the veriest dolt that ever was bora;
And the veriest lubber, sloven and beast,
Living in the world from the west to the east.
Tusser uses the word in "Five Hundred
Pointesof Good Husbandrie," 1580, page
131 (E. D. S.):
For tempests and showers deceiveth a meule,
And lingering lubbers loose many a penle.
The wo^i "lubbers" was in constant use
in the sixteenth century, and occurs at
least twice in Udai's translation of Eras
mus' "Apophthegmes." Almost 200 years
before this Langland told of the "Grete
iubres and longe" who were, too idle to
work. â Notes and Queries.

HOSPITAL BURNED
MAR LIVERMORE
All the Inmates Were
Removed Without
Injury.
No Water-Main Was Available,
So a Bucket Brigade Did
Good Work.
Destruction cf the Sanitarium Owned
by Dr. Robertson, County
Expert on Insanity.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Dec. 25. J
The large residence that formed part of
Dr. Robertson's sanitarium at Livermore
was destroyed by fire to-day, and although
there were some narrow escapes of the in
valids no one was hurt.
fire was first observed about 8 o'clock
issuing from the roof and an alarm was at
once given. Owing to the unfortunate
condition cf many of the inmates some
heroic work was needed.
As soon as it became known that the
sanitarium was on firm all the able-bodied
people in tbe town went to the rescue and
accomplished good work. Tue hurning
residence was that portion of the institu
tion in which the nervous convalescents
were housed, and they were soon out of
danger and some of them helped after
ward to fight the flames. Ouly one or two
required help to take them to a place of
safety.
The flames worked rapidly down from
the roof, and the Fire Department turned
out, but when they got to the scene they
found that they could do nothing with
their apparatus, as there was no water.
The city's mains do not extend so far out
as the sanitarium, and so the firemen
could only help the bucket brigade.
The citizens, witn the aid of buckets
and .ladders, did good work, but for a
couple of hours the fire gained on them.
The roof was rapidly destroyed and tbe
larger part of the upper story was burned
before the workers could control the
flames, but after they got the upper hand
the fire was soon subdued.
The wrecked building was erected for
the Livermore College and after some
years of service as a scholastic institution
it passed into the hands of Dr. Robertson,
wbo is the county expert on insanity.
Tbe loss is great, as in addition to the
upper part of the building all the fami
ture is spoiled.
Making the Desert Blossom.
In Eastern Australia a hundred million
sheep and great herds of cattle and dorses
now feed upon pastures covering flat
ground which thirty years ago was a
desert of soft sand, so "rotten that the
feet sank ut every step. This once worth
less ground has been beaten into compact
soil by tne feet of the sheep and cattle,
and it is believed that other great desert
expanses in Australia may be turned
into productive pasture ; and in a similar
manner.

AQUINAS FIRST
IN THE STAKE
Took the Palo Alto Handi
cap From Candelaria,
Driving.
Bellicoso Picked Up 140 Pounds
and Won the Gculet
Handicap.
Joo Web r Brought Ezekiel In an Easy
Winnerâ Sly Upset a Good Thing
in tbe Eaidwm Filly Celoso.
It was banner day at Oakland race track
yesterday. The big holiday throng, which
must have numbered fully 6000 people,
filled tbe grand stand and other points of
vantage, and ingress and egress to the
betting ring, where the layers of odds
held sway, were made under difficulties.
Everybody seemed to have money to bet
and the pencillers very accommodatingly
took all that came their way, and as but
one favorite pol&d its nose past the wire
first they retained a very large portion of
the coin thus wagered. Carefully summed
up, these gentry had a very large day of
it and were evidently sorry that Christ
mas happens but once a year.
The weather was muggy and close, with
just a suspicion of rain in the air. The
track was in good condition, though the
time made by the different winners was
only ordinary.
The Palo Alto handicap for two-year
olds at six furlongs was tbe principal fea
ture of me card, and Barney Schreiber has
the $950 that went to the first borse to his
credit. Aauinas, carrying the 8u Louis
turfman's colois, captured the dash in a
mild drive with Candelaria. Aquinas
opened favorite at 8 to 5 and was allowed
to drift back in the betting to sto 2. Can
delaria, the second choice, Tempestuous,
Arrezzo, Horatio and Dunboy were all
weli supported.
After some little delay at the post and
one recall with the flag the barrier flew up
in the sir with the bunch off well in mo
tion. Thorpe on Candelaria almost im
mediately showed in the lead, and stnk
inp the stretch two lengths before Aquinas
looked to have tbe race in hand. The lat
ter came away though under Slaughter's
riding and passed the stand half a length
beiore the Burns & Waterhouse entry.
Estaca, the Baldwin representative, was a
good thing.
The other event on the programme that
carried more value attached to it than tbe
ordinary purse affairs was the George
Goulet Champagne handicap for all nges
over six fnrlongs. Of the original entrn-s
all declined the handicapp!>r's allotments
witu the exception of six. Bellicoso, with
140 pounds up, opened favorite at 6 to 5,
later receding to 11 to 5. The Cambridge
stable's p:ur, Applause, ridden by Sam
Doggett and carrying 125 pounds, and Rey
uel Tierra, witn 108 in the saddle, had first
call at Bto 5 around post time. Sloan on
Bellicoso was sent away flying when the
barrier was raised, and always holdine the
other* safe, won easily by two lengths
from Good Times. Potentate was lapped
on the place horse.
The opening nve-furlong scramble for
maiden two-year-olds was looked upon as
a sort of good thing for .Defender, which
youngster was fiammerea down in the
betting from 7to 5 to evens. Ezekiel, an
8 to 1 chance, ridden by little Joe Weber,
disposed of the biack colt like breaking
sticks at the finish, winnin â¢ by a couple
ot open lengths. Sister Beatrice was
third.
Gene Leisb came very close to lfmding
the miie selling affair with his old horse
Woodcnopper. Played from sixes to
lours, he made all the running and was
only collared and beaten the last jump or
two by that uncertain quantity, Red
Glen, against which 5 to 1 was laid.
Arnette, the 11 to 5 favorite, ran a very
slouehy race.
Tne mile and a half hurdle handicap ap
peared to about fit Hnymarket, and Stan
ford's mount waÂ« backed in the betting
from 7t05 to 4 to 5. He was leading at

SOMETHING ABOUT FARTRIDGES.
Queer Habit* in Nesting, Feeding and
.Binding the Enemy.
Among the habits of the partridge one
is that when a covey is roosting on the
ground, with tails bunched togeiner in a
cirle, the bunch is surmounted by aline
of watchful heads, like sentinels on duty,
says the Baltimore Sun. Another is that
they run the instant the ground is touched
after a "flush," the dogs often trailing
them in rabbit-hunting fashion. Their
sense of smell is evidently very acute, for
during the nesting season, if the eggs,
which number from ten to twenty, are dis
turbed in any way or a hand even inserted
in the nest, it will be immediately deserted
and a new one built.
A short time previous to the nesting the
males are often involved in desperate
combats for the choice of mates, which
stand by and quietly watch the encounter,
seeming not to care which one becomes
the victor. The incubation is formed en
tirely by the female, the male, when not
feeding, often being perched on some
slight elevation, encouraging her by his
mellow-toned call of. "bob white." Two
and sometimes three broods of young are
reared during a season, the nesting begin
ning as early as May 1. Later in the fall
the broods of young occasionally join
forces, but whether from a want of com
pany or ;or protection is not known.
When feeding the birds are sometimes
scattered several yards apart, but at the
first sign of dan an alarm is given and
they immediately "bunch," with their
heads placed close together, as if in con
sultation. The first shot into a covey will
often came them to break and fly in all
directions, and if not disturbed again for
several minutes "scatter calls" will be
heard on every side. These are made to
collect the remaining birds, which again
bunco. Many of the market gunners seem
to have no qualms of conscience and very
often kill without hesitation an entire
covey, when at least one or two pairs of
birds should be left for breeders.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 26, 1896.
OLYMPIC FELL
BEFORE BUTTE
The Montana Team Play:d
Fast and Furious
Football.
A Big Christmas Crowd Wa f ched
and Admired the Fierce
Contest
Quick Piays on Tackles Netted Re
peated Gains â Some Caustic
Criticisms.
| {The Butte football team defeated the
Olympic eleven at Central Pars yesterday
afternoon in a hard-fought and surpris
ingly brilliant match that ended with the
score 18 to oin favor of the men from the
Montana mining town.
There was a big holiday crowd in at
tendance; the weather was perfect and the
field in good condition.
Butte played a fierce, crashing came,
and played it so fast and furious that the
local representatives, as a team, were cvi-
AS THE BALL MOVED AND BY WHOM.
.'he opening play Is Indicated at tbe top of the diagram, and Is a kick-off from the center line of
tbe gridiron fit-Id. After a touchdown ha> been made the ball is again kicked off from tbe centern ter of
tbe field.
Tne object of each team is to reach the other's goal line and carry the ball over for a touchdown.
A team may retain i o -session of the ball as long as it gains five yards on throe successive attempts or
does not lose it to the other side by dropi In? It cr by violating some role of the same. As soon as the
opposing sid â  secures the ball by one of these means, or by catching it on a kiCK, that team tries to
carry tbe ball back In the opposite direction. The learns change goals each half.
lently outclassed almost from the first
icrim mages.
Spectators were surprised at the quality
of football put up by the Montana team.
The men played fast, and massed their
strength upon tbe Olympic tackles re
peatedly. During the gnme no less than
fifty-one gains were made by this means,
while the Olympic center trio were bucked
through for eight gains, and the ends
were successfully rounded seven times by
the Butte backs.
Olympic, on the other hand, seemed nn
abie to do with her backs what the repu
tation of the men led the spectators to ex
pect. T ongh twenty-two cains were
made throu. h Butte tackles many of them
were hardly more than gains. Four suc
cessful ru>h;s were made through Butte's
center and guards, together with the same
number of gains round ihe ends.
At times Seayight, the- Stanford Varsity
halfback, did well, butceneraliy his work
waa very lar from the form he showed in
the Thanksgiving m:;tch. He repeatedly
lost ground when given the ball, partly
because the Butte men came piling
throug â ! and downed him behind tbe line
and partly because in at empting to circle
the ends he ran back to try to avoid bting
tackled and was caught by some one of the
Butte men who seldom missed a tackle.
Nolan, the \Ve?t Point star, did not play,
but his place was taken by McLaine, a
sub-end on this season's Stanford team.
McCormick, Olympic's other end, played
probabiy the best end on t;e field, al
though be was several times bowled over
by the speedy GilJis, who uses the straight
arm witu telling effect upon a would-be
tackier.
Sheehy played the best game for Olym
pic. He got in the plays weli, stole the
ball three times, and was a conspicuous
figure in the line.
McMillan was ruled off in tbe hrst half
for slugging, and Gillis. who took his
place, had, because of an injury, to give
way 10 little Harrington auriai; the sec*
ond half.
Following is a summary of the game:
Pointsâ Butte 18 on 3 ton'chdowns, 1 in first half

was kicked by Kul bac* .iaswell, and :in second

STICKNEY ON BUTTE'S GAME
The Harvard Veteran Says It Is That
of Any Ignorant Team.
The result of our game with Butte was
what I expected. That Olympic team as
a whole had never lined up toeetber be
fore it faced Buite. There were two new
men who did not know the signals. Sea
right especially did not know the signal?.
The play of Olympic was, to use an appro
priate phrase, on the bum. We did not
have a particle of interference. Of course
the end rushes were not in good shape for
getting down the field on kicks, and I
kicked a good deal.
Our men would not get down low in the
line, but Ivould stand up and be carried
back. To get low in the line is the only
way to stop mass plays.
If we had had interference we could
have run the Butte ends. McCorroack
without any assistance ran the ends sev
eral tiroes.
Butte plays a massy game, a game that
a heavy, ignorant team would naturally
play. Let nve or six men get into a play
and they could gain ground against any
team in the world if they get the start.
There i* no trickery about it.
Ido not think the Butte team is in it
with either of the varsity teams.
H. O. Stickney,
Fullback Olympic Team.
DIFFERENT IN MONTANA.
Benson, Berkeley's Old Captain, De
clares Butte People Would
Not Hiss.
Our game with the Olympic was the
hardest we have played this season. I
think that the Butte team of this year if
given varsity trainine could beat any
team that I ever played on while in Cali
fornia. In fact lam sure of it.
We do not make any pretenses at hard
training and strict dieting. Our regular
training, obtained after the men are
through their daily employment, consists
in signal practice by electric light, often
in enow, and a run back to town after
ward, the level ground being some dis
tance from the city, which is built upon
hillsides.
Before this game we had just three
nights' signal practice at home. Then we
were cooped up in a car for seventy-five
hours in coming to this City. We have
had but one real good practice rince we
have been here. Our condition, therefore,
is not up to its usual standard.
W<i did, not call time for wind but twice
in the whole game. Every other time
there was a real injury and it was really
necessary to suspend play.
I ought to have retired Jones from the
field when he was first severely injured,
but we had no other man for the place. 1
asked him to stay with it, and he did, and
p.aycd a good game though nearly laid
out after many of the rushes.
I must say I was a little ashamed of the
California crowd tbe way it hissed on sev
eral occasions when Junes lay prostrate,
aud I am a California!) myself. If tbe
same game had been played in Butte,
with the places of the teams reversed, the
Butte people would have cheered the jrood
piays of the visitors as well as those of
tbe home team and would have cheered a
player plucky enoush to Keep on after he
was badly hurt. Butte does not make
great pretenses to culture and higher edu
cation, but her goori, plain working peo
ple are fair and sportsmanlike.
We were handicapped greatly by the
loss of McMillan from the game, and by
the absence of the regular captain,
James Hooper, who not only by his
playing, but by his courage and de
termination, inspirea the boys to do their
best.
Our best play against Olympic was a
straight buck outside or inside her right
tactcle.
The officials were very fair indeed, and
I was satisfied with every decision they
gave. H. P. Benson,
Quarterback and acting captain of the
Butte team.
WILL PLAY A PICKED TEAM
Butte's Manager WUMnRThat Olym
pic Add Best Players In
State.
Editor San Francisco Callâ Sin: If Olym
pic thinks it can strengthen its team
by adding outside men and would bewili
liilc to do so I am willing that it should
add the best players it can gather in
California to oppose the Butte team in
our second match already arranged for
New Year's day.
1 should like Butte to have an oppor
tunity to meet a picked eleven from this
btate. The Ail-California team recently
named by The Call might possibly be got
together for a game wich us.
This Christmas game with the Olympics
I think is the best that has ever been
played on this coast. The officials were
the most competent I ever saw in a game.

A MILD PROTEST.
Anxious to Oblige, but Resented Un
reasonable Expectations.
The 'Washington Btar reporter hap
pened to be in the florist's shop when the
sentimental girl made her appearance.
She is Ã¼biquitous and she seems to take an
inordinate pride in the delicacy of her sen
sibilities. She didn't know exactly what
she wanted.
"The chrysanthemums are very nice
and Jarge to-day, miss," remarked the
young man who is learning the business.
"No," she said, "1 don't care forcurys
anthemums. They are so coarse and os
tentatious. They seem to be flaunting
their charms in your face so persistently
that they lose that suggestion of gentle re
finement which to me is one of the sweet
est attributes of a flower."
"Mebbe you'd like some nice fresh
orchids?" said the younp man. He had
once worked in a dry-goods store and was
bent on conveying the impression tnat it
was no trouble to show goods. "We have
some very pretty designs in orchids."
'Orchids? They are too uncanny. I
never care much lor orchids, except for a
little while. A momentary glimpse is fas
cinating, but there is notning sympathetic
abont them."
"We have a lovely article in pinks."
"Ah, no. The perfume is oppressive.
They remind me, with their elaborately
formed petals, oi nothing save the vanity
of life."
''How would you like some roses? We
make a specialty of roses, and they're on
the uargain counter for this week only."
"I don't care for roses, either. While
pinks suggest pridf, roses are to me sym
bolical of a disdainful hauteur that ia no
less unworthy." '
"If you want something retiring and
quiet â neat but not gaudy, so to apeak â
let me show you our line of violets. Now
there is something fine in tne way of a
violet."
"What memories these fl jwers revive,"
she sighed. "They take me back to other
days. "How touched I was by the fra
grance of some violets that were given to
me by â by a very dear friend. I cher
ished the little blossoms; but, alasl I
found that they faded."
â¢'Well, miss," the young man rejoined
in the tone of one wnose patience has
been sorely tried, "flowers Is flowers.
â W'.' can guarantee that you're getting as
good as there is on the market when you
come to us; full nize and everything ex
actly as represented. But we can't war
rant'em not to- fade."

WILL NOT SIGN
THE CONTRACT
Construction of the New
Hall of Justice May
Be Delayed.
Mayor Sutro Preparing a Veto
Message to Be Submitted
Next Week.
Claims to Have Discovered Numerous
Legal Defects in the In*
strument.
Mayor Sutro has decided to refuse to
sign the contract awarded to Board man ft
Boardman, contractors, for the construc
tion of the Hall of Justice on the site of
the old City Hall, at a cost of $300,000.
Ha was seen at his home yesterday, and
owing to the fact that he had none of the
documents refer; ing to the matter at hand
at first declined to say anything on the
subject for publication. He finally con
sented to do so, qualifying his statement,
however, by saying that it would be more
in detail and more specific if he could have
had access to the records.
"After a most careful examination of
tbe papers relating to this contract," said
the Mayor, "my attorneys found several
legal defects in them, and for this reason
1 feel constrained to refuse to attach my
signature to the contract. I shall send a
communication to the Board of Super
visors in connection therewith early next
week. In this all my reasons will be set
forth in detail.
''In the first place the orignal ordinance
which I signed is defective. These defects
have only been discovered lately. The
law declares that in order to make an ap
propriation for a building of that sort it
must first be declared that the building is
a necessity. This was eituer not done at
all or not done in a regular manner. Ido
not recollect which is the case.
"Secondly, the law declares that no
alterations shall be made in the building
after th^ contract is given out while the
contract itself permits alterations.
"Furthermore the ordinance requires
that this money should be expended upon
the lot described as formerly occupied by
the old City Hall, while the contract calls
for a building to be erected outside of this
lot for use as a moreue. This is all clearly
irregular. There are other things that I
cannot fully recall.
"I would also state that this contract
would be a very dangerous thing for the
contractors, for if they undertook the
work under it they would run the risk of
losing many thousand dollars, as their
right to reimbursement under the contract
could be questioned at any time. I have
had several interviews with Boardman <fe
Boardman, the contractors, at which both
sides were represented by lawyers, and
the situation was fully explained, but
they seemed to want to take their chance,
but I felt duty bound to refuse to sign the
contract.
"The only recourse the contractors have
under the circumstances is to apply to the
courts for a mandamus compelling me to
sign the contract, and this, 1 understand,
is what they intend to do. My idea would
be to let the whole matter go over for tbe
new Board of Supervisors. They should
pass a proper resolution and then dra.w up
a contract in accordance therewith and
with law making the appropriation."
ME. GRIFFIN'S CHRISTMAS.
Broken Furniture and Baked Turkey
Figaro in a Family
Quarrel.
There were hilarious times last evening
when the family of Pat Griffin of 20 Birch
avenue eathered around the table. There
was Pat himself, his wife, her mother, and
a number of sisters and sisters-in-law and
brothers and brothers-in-law. Tbe head
of the house was not in the best of humur,
and he made this fact apparent by kicking
over the table before the first course was
served.
His wife remonstrated, whereupon Grif
fin seized the baked fowl by the legs and
started to hurl it at his wife's head ; but
the turkey was well done and it parted
company with the leg<3.
The bird proper struck the mother-in
law in the face and carromed off, continu
ing its flight through the street window
and fell upon the sidewalk at the feet of
Officer Brownlie.
The officer was naturally surprised to
find it rainine turkey, gravey and stuffing
and he waited for a repetition of the phe
nomena. Then his attention was at
tracted to tbe storm overhead, and it was
a storm. The rattle of broken crockery
mingled with an assortment of female
shrieks and male curses. It seems that
the mother-in-law resented the affront
and she whacked Griffin on the head with
tbe leg of the broken table.
In the melee the stove was overturned.
The police office quieted things down by
arresting Griffin for being drunk. Griffin
had to have five stitches taken in his sculp
at tbe hospital to close up the evidence of
his mother-in-law's rebuke.
A WHITE REDWOOD.
It Grows Near Cacadero and Contributed
Waxen Sprays to Christinas
Evergreen Wreaths.
One of the greatest novelties, perhaps
the oddest natural curiosity of the Christ
mas season, was a wagon-load of white
redwood from Sonoma County. Mr. Orr,
who is interested in that part of Califor
nia, sent large quantities of redwood sap
lings to town for Christmas-trees, and by
Way of variety included some "ever-
Whites." This new-fashioned wood is
positively necessary to meet the exigen
cies of the occasion, for in reality these

leaves are white eternally, almost, even as
the evergreens of ihe Siquoia semper
virens are aiways grreen.
The white redwood had all the appear
ance of waxen imitations of the natural
tree. The bark and wood are not differ
ent from the common redwood, but one
distinct dissimilarity marking the freak
ish tree. Wherever there is ereen in the
redwood there is white in this one â that
is to say, the young shoots and the leavee
are white, with something of a waxen hue
perceptible. The odd sprays were torn
apart into small pieces and mixed spar
ingly with evergreen wreaths and red
berries in the Claus Spreckels market on
Market street, opposite Grant avenue.
'There is only one white redwood to be
found in all the* forests up the coast," ex
plained Mr. Orr, Christmas eve, "aud that
grows on the Rule ranch, near Cazadero.
There used to be another white redwood,
but the forest fires came along and killed
it, leaving this one on the Rule ranch."
''Does it grow in a dark place, hidden
by larger trees?"
"Not at all. It has the sunlight all
around and through its branches. There
is not a speck of green about it from top
to bottom. Nobody seems to know why it
is white, but it grows right along like any
other redwood tree."
Dr. Gustav Eisen of the Academy of
Sciences, was deeply interested in this tree
when told about it.
"All trees of the pine species," said he,
"occnsionally have a white one. There is
no pigment in the green of the redwood
it-af. The color is caused by an insect and
for some reason the insect cannot live in
the&e white trees."
SUICIDE OF A HOSTLER.
Christopher Nelson Hangs Himself to a
Kafter While Despondent.
Christopher Nelson, a hostler, about 40
years of age, committed suicide yesterday
afternoon by hanging himself to a rafter
in the rear of the stables in which he was
employed, 1532 Polk street. The body was
discovered aDout an hour after death had
taken place and was removed to the
morgue.
The cause which prompted Nelson to
commit suicide is unknown. He had been
despondent for some time and, as bis act
would indicate, became mentally unbal
anced and took his own life.
COLLEGES ON THE WATER
Berkeley and Stanford Might
Meet in Annual Row
ing Matches.
Prospects That Opportunities May Tet
Favor a Consummation
of tbe Idea.
Lovers of aquatic sports hereabouts are
looking forward to the time when the two
big California universities shall meet upon
the water as do the great rival colleges of
the East and of England.
In the inauguration of an annual inter
collegiate rowing match between Califor
nia and Stanford they anticipate great en
couragement to the graceiul sport, and
with the many nundreds of partisans back
of and intensely interested in each col
lege they believe rowing would be estab
lished as one of the most generally popu
lar of all amateur athletic contests. Inter
collegiate rivalry has proved the very Jife
of football on this coast. It has developed
track athletics until California's university
men have nothing to fear from any other
State in the Union. And it has main
tained baseball when interest in the game
had almost died out.
What then are the possibilities of the
two universities coming together, and
what has prevented their meeiing up to
this time? The fault is not with the Uni
versity of California. Berkeley has had a
boating association, and has maintained a
crew for tbe last three years encouraged
by the hope of some day meeting a crew
from Stanford. This year the Berkeley
crew made a very creditable showing
against more experienced Sau Francisco
oarsmen.
Nor is the fault intentionally with the
Stanford men. It i- due principally to
present existing natural obstacles to the
practice and development of a crew. The
nearest point of the bay is four miles from
Stanford University and accessible only
by way of an indifferent and little fre
quented road over a long stretch ol marsh
land.
At low tide, owing to the comparative
shallowness of the water, a broad mud flat
marks the western shore line of the sÂ«outu
ern arm of San Francisco Bay. Nothing
short of a long pier to permanently deep
water would overcome this particular ob
stacle, for the students, busy a& they are
all the torenoon and early in the afternoon
in lecture.rooms, could not regulate
their practice to the varying tides, but
would have to train as do the football,
baseball and track pen during the late
<iaily recreation hours immediately pre
ceding supper time.
For the past two years there have seemed
to be prospects of the establishment of an
electric-car line from Pain Alto, a mile
from the university, to the bay, three
miles beyond. Those students particu
larly desirous of seeing a crew developed
have looked expectantly forward to the
accomplishment of this enterprise as a
partial solution of the problem of ways
and means, for it cannot be deni<d that
eight miles reeular travel by private con
veyance would be expensive and covered
afoot or awheei would consume so much
time that very littie would be left .-or row
ing. Then, too, there is the expense of
building a properly equipped boathouse,
which under present condii ions would be
during a great part of the day and night
unwatched and far from the nearest habi
tation. That this is not an imaginary
danger has often been proven in the treat
ment accorded private hunting boats
moored in the marshes.
On the other hand Stanford has some
present opportunities for boating in a
small way on Lagunita, a little artificial
lake, beautifully situated only a quarter
of a mile back from the quadrangle build
ings :md covering an area of about twenty
five acres. On the edge of this willow
skirted pleasure lake is a boathouse built
three years ago by a then existing Stan
ford Boat Ciub that after a great and
successful struggle of over a year paid its
debts and became a thing of the past,
while the boathouse occupied in part by
several private small rowboats and sail
boats continued to be used early each
summer as a dressing-room for several
hundred students who regularly each
warm afternoon disport themselves in the
waters of the placid little lake.
Part of the boathouse has for the past
two years been occupied by several self
supporting students, who by special per
mission live there in curiously fitted up
rooms, heated by a fireplace supplied with
a rou b. home-made chimney built
against the side of the light, frame build
ing.
Ail Stanford's athletic and musical
organizations are supported by the student
body, which in turn derives its principal
revenue from football games, the expenses
over the general receipts for baseball,
track athletics, tennis, debates and per
haps musical and other organizations be
ing made good out of the annual football
surplus, which up to the present time has
not yet been quite sufficient to pay off old
standinu bills and put the student body
completely out of debt. Under these con
ditions the student body is nut in a posi
tion to incur the expense necessary to tbe
establishment of such an equipment as
would be necessary for the maintenance
of a crew.
Over three years ago, at the time when
there were immediate prospects of send
ing a Stanford crew to the World's Fair at
Chicago, Senator and Mrs. Fair donated
$800 for tbe purchase of a barge. Tbe
barge was not bought, though the money
is probably accessible whenever the stu
dents are ready to use it for the specific
purpose for which it was offered.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 26, 1896.
HIS FOOT CAUGHT
IN THE TRANSOM
John Cornish, a Colored
Man, Found Suspended,
Head Down.
Released From His Peculiar
Fosition, He Fails to Ex
plain His Sad Plight
An Investigation Revealed the Pres
ence of Turkeys on the Other
Side of the Door,
John Cornish, a colored man residing at
414 Jackson street, and who claims to be
an assistant janitor of the building 508
California street, was found last night at
9 o'clock by Sergeant Helms and Officer
The Embarrassing Position of John Cornish When Found by the
Police in the Building at 508 California Street Last Night.
The Police Also Found Some Prime Turkeys on the Other
Side of the Door.
Hackett suspended by his right leg from
the transom over room 27 on the third
floor.
The manner in which Cornish got him
self into such a peculiar position may or
may not be explained by the circumstance
developed by an investigation made by
Sergeant Holms.
In this building is located the office of
Henry J. Crocker, executor of the Mc-
Laugblin estate. Frank Schilling, an at
torney-at-law, has bis office also in the
building but two floors higher than that
on which Mr. Crocker's office is located.
Mr. Schilling bad visited his office last
night about 8 o'clock and after transact
ing some business locked his door and was
about to take his departure when he heard
what he thought was the moaning of
some person apparently in pain or dis
tress. As soon as he reached tbe side
walk he sent a messenger to the Califor
nia-street Police Station, when Sergeant
Helms responded. In the meantime Offi
cer Hackett had come upon the scene and
with a Call representative an entrance
to the building was gained by the ser
geant opening the front door. The offi
cers at once proceeded to make an inves
tigation.
On the second floor, which was dark,
the moans which attracted the attention
of Mr. Schilling were distinctly heard and
by lighting the hall gas jet the cause was
found.
The officers observed the body of a col
ored man banging by one leg from the
transom over tbe door. Alongside of him,
but beyond his reach, was a short bamboo
step-ladder, such as is used by window
cleaners. It required only a few minutes
to liberate the suspended man by freeing
his foot from the leverage of the tran
som frame, that held bis foot like the grip
of a vise.
When taken down he was completely
exhausted and foaming at tbe mouth, as
if suffering from strangulation.
An examination of the room, which had
been previously occupied by the Misses
Shepherd as typewriters', revealed tbe
presence of some turkeys hanging against
the wajl.
Cornish, on regaining strength, gave his
name and residence, and claimed to be an
assistant janitor to Robert Wilson, whose
residence he gave at 921 Sacramento
street, but declined to give any explana
tion of bow he came to try to enter
room 27.
An examination of room 5, which is the
one occupied by the janitor, threw some
light on the mystery, as a case was found
there with the following address :
The HcLaughUn estate, four turkeys.
San Francisco,
Cai.
Paid. Value f9O.
Cornish was taken to the California
street station, pending an investigation as
to his statement regarding his being one
of the help in tbe building. He was sub
sequently charged with burglary.
DEAD IN HER ROOM.
Mrs. K. IWorral de Brevans' Lifeless
Body Discovered by Her Son.
Mrs. K. Moreal de Brevans, an aged lady
of 79 years, died, it is presumed from
heart disease, in her rooms, 1513 Powell
street, either yesterday morning or Christ.
mas eve. The old lady was of a quiet
disposition and seldom left her â  room,
consequently when no sound of life came
from her apartments nothing was thought
of it.
Christmas morning came, and H. 1%
Moreal, son of the deceased, left his home
in Alameda and came to this City for the
purpose of enjoyin â  the holiday with his
mother. He knocked at her door, but
there was no answer. Knowing that his
mother trad made arrangements -for his
visit, Moreal immediately suspected that
ometbing unusual had occurred.
He procured a pass key, entered the
room, and discovered that his mother was
dead. The body was on the floor, fully
attired, showing that death bad come
without warning. The young man was
almost prostrated with grief. After an
investigation the Coroner decided that
death was due to natural causes. Tbe
body will be removed to Alameda for in
terment to-day.

WILL BE A BIG MEETING
Plans of the Panhandle and
Ashbury Heights Improve*
ment Club.
Resolutions to Be Prepared for Ac
tion at the Session This
Evening.
A special meeting of the Panhandle
and Ashbnry Heights Improvement Club
is called for to-night for the purpose of
remonstrating against the location of the
Pestbouse on the Almshouse tract. It
promises to be the very largest meeting
of all the large meetings held by the
club.
A resolution condemning the railroad
tracks, platforms and fence maintained
by the Park and Ocean Railroad Com
pany on the sidewalk of Stanyan street,
between Haight and Waller, without
warrant from any authority whatsoever,
and petitioning the Board of Supervisors
to remove the same, will be introduced;
also, a resolution remonstrating against
the condition of the Treadwell estate,
which is the cause of much damage to
property, the drifting sand filling up
areas, breaking down fences, filling up
sewers and causing them to burst; and
also a resolution empowering tbe presi
dent of the club to appoint a committee
of five property-owners, members of the
club, to canvass the district for a pure
artesian water supply and reservoir sites
to distribute the same.
The club thinks that shouid the Pest
house be located on the Almshouse tract,
in proximity to Lake Honda, the water
would not be improved, but that on ac
count of the infectious diseases necessarily
to be treated in the Pestbouse it would
surely be contaminated.
A resolution criticising the so-called
vapor light, lately tried in the park, and
disapproving light produced by the vapor
izing of coal oil or gasoline, "will be pre
pared.
The Park Commissioners will again be
petitioned by tbe club to light the park
and avtnue with electric arc lights of the
very latest and most modern type, and in
sufficient numbers.
A general review of the work so far ac
complished by the club, and a looking
after street work in course of construction
and projectea, or to be projected. A re
port from tbe committee for the extension
and opening of H street, from Stanyan
street to First avenue, will be made.
TWO WERE NEARLY
BURNED TO DEATH
A Very Narrow Escape for
John Young and His
Wife.
A Coal Oil Can Exploded in
Their House on R ten
Street.
They Are Now in the Hospital Suf
fering From Burns All Over
Their Bodies.
There came near being a shocking fatal
ity in John D. Young's little three-room
cottage at 338>Â£ Ritch street
afternoon. As it was Young and his wife
were frightfully burned about the limbs
and body and they are now in the Re
ceiving Hospital.
It was all caused by carelessness in
handling a coal oil lamp.
Young is a carpenter well advanced in
years. His wife also has passed the noon
day of life. He was out during the after
noon, and about 3 o'clock he returned to
his home and said be was ready for his
Christmas dinner. His wife at tbe time
was dusv preparing the meal, so she told
her husband to fill the lamp, as she did
not have the time. Youn^ took the lamp
and a candle to the place where the five
gallon can of kerosene was kept. A min
ute later there was an explosion that shook
the little dwelling.
Mrs. Young ran into the room to see if
her husband was hurt, and as she did so
the burning fluid set her clothes on fire.
The lamp and the can of coal oil must
have exploded. Young dashed past his
wife and ran into tbe street, for his gar
ments, too, were in flames.
The unfortunate woman ran shrieking
to the front door and a crowd quickly
gathered. By this time Mrs. Young's
skirts and waist were almost burnt
through. Kindly hands seized her and a
bystander threw an overcoat around her,
smothering the flames, while others went
to the rescue of the man.
In tbe meantime the fire in the house
was making rapid headway, so a bucket
brigade was started. Officers Videau and
Stevens were among the early arrivals,
and while one sent the sufferers to the
hospital in the patrol wagon the other
called out engine 10 on a still alarm. The
firemen finished extinguishing the flames.
The building was damaged to the extent
of about $100.
At the Receiving Hospital the patients
presented a pitiiul appearance. Young
was badly burned about the leet and legs.
His wife fared much worse. She waa
burned from her face to her feet, and she
suffered terribly.
Alter her wounds were dressed Mrs.
Young stated that she bad $50 in the
pockt of her dress, and added that it was
about all the money she had in the world.
When the dress was torn off the money
must have been lost in the rubbish of
burned rags.
THE ALMSHOUSE DINNER.
The City Wards' Chriatmaa Dinner of
Koast Beef.
Captain E. Redly, superintendent of
the Almshouse, treated his boarders to a
square meal of prime roast beef yesterday.
The City's wards number 934, the great
est number yet registered on tbe Aims
house books, and to give tnese unfortu
nates an extra good Christmas dinner
there were 700 pounds of first-class beef
cooked, together with several poumis of
shanks, ribs and other soup- producing
material, with which each inmate was
plentifully supplied.
Captain Reddy, in order to give the in
mates a choice, had a vote taken a few
days before Christmas as to whether they
would have turkey or roast beef and soup.
The choice was almost unanimous in
favor of beef.
Mince pie followed as desert and was
much relished by those who in their old
tine are unfortunately thrown upon the
charity of a generous municipality.

THREE SUSPECTS
CRUELLY THRASHED
Taken From an American
Ship and Beaten in
Corinto.
Captain of the San Juan Blamed
for Surrendering His
Employes.
E. E. Stoddard Says Central Ameri
can Consuls Lore Jobn Barley
corn and Procrastination.
â¢'You may take them off and kill them
for all I care," said the captain.
This is what E. E. Stoddard, a Pacific
Coast agent and traveling salesman for a
Buffalo bicycle manufacturer, said tbe
captain of the Pacific Mail steamship
San Juan said in the port of Corinto,
Nicaragua, November 10 last, while the
ship was lying tuere. Mr. Stoddard was
then making a business trip through Mex
ico and Central American States. A Span
ish traveling man had dropped his grip
containing Â£150 of English gold at bis
stateroom door and carelessly left it. It
was stolen, and three of the ship's erew â
two waiters of the dining-rcom and a her
culean Chilean, a coal passer â were
charged with the theft. The Spaniard
went ashore and complained to the Com
andante oi the port, a gentleman of fe
rocious appearance, over six feet tall, said
Mr. Stoddard. Taking up the story at
this point he continued:
"The comandante, who is th* chief
officer of the port, came off to the San
Juan and told the captain he wanted to
take tbe accused men ashore for punish
ment. Tiie captain said he did not care if
the comanaante took the men off and
killed them. So the men were taken
ashore and they were. nearly killed, too.
The saptain had no right to let the men
be taken ashore. He should have brought
the men on into United States waters and
given them a regular trial. There was a
great deal of complaint among the passen
gers about it.
"I followed the men ashore. They were
mercilessly flogged. Strips of cane were
used. The men were bent over a chair and
their backs bared. They were flogged
with the idea of forcing them to confess
and return the money. Their backs were
lacerated and bleeding. It was awful.
The big Chilean was given 160 lashes. He
then said he thought he could tind the
gold. He did find part of it Then they
gave him forty lashes more. One of the
others, a small man, was given 140. He
feebly denied that be had stolen the gold,
but said he thought he knew where it was.
He could not find it, and they thrashed
him till the physician bade them to stop if
they did not want to kid him. When he
returned to consciousness they refused to
give him water.
"I never want to see a sight like that
again. Tdo not remember the name of
the captain of the San Juan, but the pas
sengers were unanimous in tbe opinion
that the men should have had a trial and
been brought into an American port."
"What did you hear down on the isth
mus concerning the Nicaragua canal?"
"The people down there, so far as I
heard, are skeptical about it. They doubt
that it will ever be constructed. I met an
American engineer, a young man who has
been at work on tbe scheme. He doubted
that the plan is practicable. His opinion
is that the canal will nil up with the over
flow from the rivers and cannot be kept
open unless dredged all the time. The
canal looks well on paper, but it's a
miehty big job.
"They talfc about those Central Ameri
can States affording eood openings for
young men. That is not true. I know of
capable and clever young fellows down
there working for $25 a month.
"The American Hag is not respected
down there as the English flag is, or as it
should be. Our Consuls do not stand on
their dignity as they ought to. If an
American be arrested or gets into tronble
our Consuls put the matter off, shrug their
shoulders and procrastinate. Some of the
American Consuls are not yery busy.
They sit around the hotel and drink
whisky. Some of them gave me the Im
pression of being political hacks sent off
there to get them out of the way. Their
chief representative capacity is "exercised
in sitting around the hotel and drinking
whisky, as I said before."
"What is the future of the American
bicycle down there?"
"In Mexico it is all right, but in the
other countries not very promising. In
Guatemala Ido not believe there are 400
wheels. Outside of Mexico there are no
roads to speak of. The dealers in Guate
mala City are loaded up with English,
French and German wheels which they
can't sell at any price. All the stores are
carrying wheels and the business is over
done there as it is here in this country.
In Guatemala City a couple of CaJifornia
boys run a bicycle and repair shop and are
uoins: well. They are Mr. Hunt, who for
merly lived in Sacramento, and Mr. Au
ment, formerly of Mayfield."
Mr. Stoddard brought back two large
boa constrictor skins and other trophies,
which now decorate his rooms in the Bay
City Wheelmen's Club.
