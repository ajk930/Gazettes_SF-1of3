the Shrine of Prosperity.
CANTON, Ohio, Oct. 12.â Major Mc-
Kinley to-day expressed himself as being
in the very best of health and spirits and
in every way well prepared for another
week of hard work incident upon the re
ception of many visiting" delegations, of
which thirty are expected during the
week.and they will come from a dozen
different States. There are two delega
tions scheduled for to-day. Both were
from Pennsylvania, and represented the
miners of the Monongahela Valley and
the workinginen of Roscoe, Pa. During
the morning Major McKinley was ad
vised that these deleeations iiad been
consolidated and would not arrive in
Canton until the afternoon.
Major McKinley is in receipt of many
congratulations upon his address to the
ex-Confederate veterans on Friday last.
The following telegram was received this
morning:
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 12.â Hon. Major
McKinley, Canton: The members of the Union
Veterans' Patriotic League iv all parts of the
country enthusiastically approve your ad
dress to the Confederate veterans of the Shen
andoah Valley. L. Edwin Dudley,
National Secretary U. V. P. L.
The Pennsylvania visitors, to the num
ber of 600, arrived on a special train at 1
o'clocK. They came from the following
towns in the "Fourth Pool," Monongahela
Valley: Charleroi, Belle Vernon, Fayette
City, Roscoe, Coal Center, California and
Brownsville. Many ladies accompanied
the excursionists. The rain, which had
been falling more or less heavily at inter
vals during the morning, came down very
hard just as the Pennsylvanians arrived.
All outdoor demonstrations were there
fore abandoned, and the visitors were
escorted to the Tabernacle. A colored
ciub had just begun to sing some cam
paign selections when Major McKinley
entered the hall. Instantly every man in
ihe audience was on his feet and cheeriae
at tfre top of his voice.
Major McKinley had never been greeted
with a more emphatic welcome than that
of the miners ana others of the Mononga
hela Valley. George V. Lawrence, who
has represented the district whence
came this enthusiastic delegation for sev
eral years in Congress, acted as spokes
man. Mr. Lawrence is over 80 years oid,
and is a personal friend of Major McKin
ley. In his remarks he said the delega
tion represented the miners, mcci anics,
laborers and men of all classes in the
counties of Washington, Westmoreland
and Fayette.
When the speaker referred to Major Mc-
Kinley as the next President of the United
States there was a great outburst of ap
plause. "The laboring men in particular
in our district are your best friends," said
Mr. Lawrence. "ThÂ«Â»y have seen the
splendid prosperity which you strug
gled so long and hard to build up only to

I trade principles of the Democratic party.
The laboring classes have hopes in you
and believe that your election will restore
that prosperity to them."
The ex-Congressman then presented
Major McKinley with a cold-mounted
| can â¢ made from the wood of a door of the
house in which James G. Blame wa< born.
Trie cane was the rift of the Republican
Club of Fayette City. Another cane,
made of glass, the gift of the glass
workers of Belle Vernon, was also pre
sented to the candidate. In responding
to the address of Mr. Lawrence, Major
McKinley said:
It gives me sincere pleasure to meet at my
home citizens of Fayette, Washington and
Westmoreland counties, Pennsylvania, and
make acknowledgment of their friendly visit.
It has been a source of peculiar pleasure to me
to meet mv old friend and colleague in the
National House of Representatives, your ven
erable spokesman, Mr. Lawrence. I always
found him voting for right things and for the
supremacy of the Republican principles and
their embodiment into public law. Western
Pennsylvania is filled with many proud and
historic memories. It registers the birthplace
of that splendid parliamentarian and (rifted

statesmsr and great Secretary of State, James
G. Blalne. [Great cheering.]
It is very gratifying to me to receive at the
hanrta of the Fayetle Club this beautiful cane,
made from the wood of Mr Blame's home in
which he was born, in Brownsville, and I as
sure you that it shall always be preserved and
kept in my family as a precious souvenir.
[Cheers.] You are fortunate, too, in having at
one time among your citizens of Fayette
County that illustrious financier, Albert Gal
latin, who became the first Secretary of the
Treasury nnder Thomas Jefferson in 1801, and
who filled that great office for twelve years,
and is known in the history of our country as
one of the greatest Secretaries we ever had,
ranking with Hamilton. [Great applause.]
He was a member ot your Legislature
from Fayette County, a member of the
National House of Representatives from
Western Pennsylvania, ior a brief period in
the Senate of the United States and then elect
ed to fill the office of Secretary of the
Treasury. It is said that the first resolution
he introduced as Congressman in the National
House was a resolution inquiring about the
condition of the treasuryâ a resolution that is
not needed now. [Great laughter and ap
plause.] He was distinguished for having al
ways insisted that the revenues of the Gov
ernment should be equal at all times to the
public expenditures; and one of the greatest
monuments he left Is that during his admin
istration as Secretary of the Treasury he re
duced the National debt from $86,000,000 in
1802 to about $45,000,000 in 1812. It was
his proud boast, when he made bis report to
Congress, that this wonderful reduction of
the National debt had go no on without resort
ing to internal taxation, either direct or indi
rect. But this vast sum of money was pro
vided for by duties upon imports. [Cheering.]
After speaking at some length on the
tariff Major MeKinley continued:
There is just as much money in this country
to-day as there -was from 1870 to 1890 and
more. But what is the trouble? [Cries of "No
worK, no work."] Yes, no work. It is work
that puts money into circulation. Money does i
not want to be idle any more than labor wants
to be idle. The man who has money wants
that money to be earning something and the
only reason he does not put it out now is
because he Is afraid he will never get it back,
or get it back in a depreciated currency. And
when he does not put It out and it does not
circu: ate then there is no work. [Applause.]
When you have idle men and idle money dis
tress and suffering prevail.
Now I do not know what yon think about
it, but I think you cannot have money too
good. [Applause.] Wnen a miner has per
formed a week's workâ l do not know how long
it has bpeu since he has performed a full
week's workâ when the miner in the mines
and the glassblower in the glass works and the
worklngman In any occupation has performed
his week's work and has his week's pay, that
week's pay represents the value of his labor
for six days, does it not? Well, don't he want
the money he receives to be the best in the
world? Does he not want that money to have
as much purchasing power as any money any
where? Answer when you have received dol
lars worth 100 cents in purchasing power you
want to know that they will not lose, but keep
that 100 cents' worth of purchasing power.
[Tremendous cheering.] That is the kind of
money we have now, and that is the kind of
money we propose to continue to have.
I believe, my fellow-citizens, that with this
returning confidenceâ and confidence is half
the capital of the worldâ money will come out
from its hiding place, be Invested in enter
prises all over the country and put all Idle
men to work [applause], and so believing, I
stand for that policy which will most surely
restore confidence. Now, having said that
much, I desire to thank the glassworkers for
their gift, which I highly valueâ for anything
that comes from the hands of labor is always
cherished by me. [Tremendous applause.]
There is nothing, in all this contest, that has
given me so much satisfaction and encourage
ment as to feel that I have the worklngmen
standing for the cause I represent. I thank
you all for this call and wish you a pleasant
visit here in Canton and a safe return to your
homes. [Great applause.]

Directors to Submit Three
Names to the Propa
ganda at Rome.
Father Yorke Is Mentioned as
a Probable Successor to
Bishop Keane.
LEO ACTED INDEPENDENTLY.
Bat Before Making a Change at the
Catholic University He Heard
From Satolli.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Oct. 12.â The
meeting of the board of directors of the
Catholic University of America to select
three names from which t >c Propaganda
at Rome will choose a rector to succeed
Bishop Keane as head of the university
will not bd held until Wednesday of next
week, but rumor is already busy with
various names. From Europe comes the
announcement that Bishop Spalding of
Peoria, 111., is to succeed Bishop Keane,
while from San Francisco, where Bishop
Keane arrived last night, is telegraphed
the suggestion of the Rev. Peter C. Yorke.
It is said that the directors may leave the
whole matter to the action of the Arch
bishops who will meet here at the same
time. In either caae, however, the an
nouncement of the name of a rector prior
to this meetinc would be premature.
REV. PETER C YORKE of San Francisco, Who May Succeed Bishop
Keane as Rector of the Catholic University at Washington.
r In deposing Bishop Keane the Pope ap.
! peara to have acted independently. It is
probable that none of the directors, not
even Cardinal Gibbons, knew of his pur
pose before the arrival of his letter in
this country. The tone of his communi
cation is proof that it was not his purpose
to humiliate the late rector, and the un
fortunate publicity which brought about
that result is believed to have been the
work of some enemy of Bishop Keane,
wno risked injury to the church to gratify
his personal feelings.
The usuai procedure for deciding such
questions as the election of the rector of a
Catholic university is well established.
The Pope appoints a committee of his ad
visors, cardinals and others. It is known
as a congregation. To this committee the
matter is referred. They take up the con
sideration of it, bold lengthy, meetings if
necessary and decide points of difference
by vote. The whole proceeding is put on
record by the secretary of the committee.
A brief of the discussions, together with
the results, is made. Upon an appointed
day tins is submitted to the Pope by the
secretary. After the consideration, as be
considers proper, the Pope briefly ap
proves or rejects the conclusion of the
committee. This was practically the
course taken at the establishment of the
constitution ot the university and the elec
tion of Bishop Keane as rector. The con
gregation was then made up wholly of
cardinals. The action of the directors at
that time was to name Bishop Keane as
the man whom they wished to have placed
at the head and to send him with a letter
to the Pope ex pi easing their views.
That Pope Leo intends to give full con
sideration to the wishes of the directors
and that they will discuss the rectorship
iuily is shown by the following authorized
statement from Cardinal Gibbons:
"Far from there beinc; any disagree
ment or antagonism or want of harmony
among the members of the board of direc
tors of the university, there is a full and
perfect unanamity of sentiment and pur
pose in all that regards the direction and
government, the development and progress
of the institution. In their next meeting
there will be only one object and aim,
and that will be to select a worthy suc
cessor to Bishop Keane, who will labor to
secure the best interests of the univer
sity."
-A prominent Washington Catholic said
to The Call correspondent to-day:
"I don't think either Bishop Keane's
position in the school question or any
race rivalry was responsible for the Pope's
action. It was solely due to Cardinal
Satolli's influence."
"Do you think it was any part of the
Cardinal's supposed effort to have him
self succeed Pope Leo?"
"Oh.no; not at all. But he made up
bis mind some time ago that Bishop
Keane was not a fit man for the place.
What he based his opinions on I do not
know. lam sure it was not a matter of
personal feeling. But I was told nearly a
year ago that the Cardinal had said to my
informant that Bishop Keane should not
remain at the head of the school. The
Cardinal's close personal relations with
the Pope would make his opinion suf
ficient to decide the matter. It is proba
ble, however, that the matter has been
discussed at Rome several times in the
past year, and there has been considerable
correspondence between Cardinal Satolli
and the Pope in regard to it.
"The purpose undoubf dly was to effect
the change quietly and for Bishop Keane
to make a change of duty entirely to his
liking. I know personally that he is in
poor health, and he said publicly several
months ago that he desired to retire and
have a rest. The suggestion that Mgr.
Schroeder had any part in bringing about
the change is without foundation. The
Pope would no more listen to him on that
subject than he would listen to me."

increased in fury and that much damage
is being done. At 2:30 this morning a
monster wave struck Seidl's concert hall
at Brighton and tore away two-thirds of
the struciure. There is little hope that
the remainder can be saved.
The Brighton racetrack stables are
flooded and the horses have been removed.
Rough estimates place the financial loss
along the Coney Island beach at $200,000.
A large number of temuorary structures
along the water front were destroyed. The

The Ocean Hotel, west of the Brighton
Beach Hotel, was surrounded by water
and the portico inundated. The founda

"WE EXONERATE
CHARLES ABIGER"
Coroner's Jury Decides Yon
Ballestrem's Death Was
Accidental.
Its Belief Not Shaken by the Con
flicting Statements of the
Artist.
STRANGE CAREER OF THE COUNT
Once Prospered in San Francisco as a
Bootblack and House White
washer.
MONTEREY, Cal., Oct. 12.â The kill,
ing of Count Wolfgang yon Ballestrem by
Charles Abiger brings forcibly to mind an
article in The Call only a week ago re
garding the superstitious belief of the
old Indian families in the neighborhood
of Point Lobos Park that any one who
ventures near the point during the "hoo
doo" period will meet with some mis
chance. This is the "hoodoo" season acÂ«
cording to the prophets of the tribe, and
already two men have been killed at Point
Lobos â one accidentally shot while hunt
ing and the other killed by his boon com
panion.
The mystery surrounding the death of
Count yon Ballestrem was not entirely
cleared by the Coroner's inquest to-day.
While the jury exonerated Charles Abiger
of design in killing his friend the testi*
mony given by Abiger and others is so
conflicting â especially the statements
made by Abiger yesterday in jail and that
given by him to-day before the Coroner â I
that the case may not end with this jury's j
verdict. On the stand Abiger said in sub*
stance:
"I have known Count Ballestrem about
four or five years. We met accidentally
in San Francisco. He went back to the ,
old country during that time, but when
he -returned to the United States we met

again and have been warm friends ever i
since, living together all the time for the
last two years.
"I don't know the time the shooting oc
curred, but it was about dark. L,said I
was going bunting. He said I must not.
I got rcy gun and started. Now I was in
the front room, which he used for a
studio, while he wa3 in the rear room or
kitchen. There is a step between the two
apartments. "Wben he said I should not
go he came forward, and seizing the gun
by the barrel tried to take it away from
me. We were having a friendly little
tussle over it wben he slipped on the step,
letting go of the gun quickly. That threw
me off my balance and the rest I don't
know. The trigger got caught on some
thing and as he was catching his balance
after slipping off the step tbe gun was dis
charged. He staggered and I caught Him
in my arms as he fell. I laid him on tbe
floor and went at once for aid."
" Abiger said he did not know the pun
was loaded. Tbe hammer was not cocked.
He had the gun first and Baliestrem tried
to get it from him. He said that they had
never had a cross word and had always
been the very best of friends. He was not
drunk, neither was the Count. Both were
in their shirt sleeves during the scuffle.
The gun was discharged just as Bailestrem
slipped, and he was probably nine feet
away when the charee struck him.
In the statement made by Abicer while
in jail yesterday Abiger declared that the
scdffle began in the inner apartment.
W T hen a Call correspondent made an ex
amination of the hut yesterday a slip of
paper bearing the words, "B. died at 11:3)
p. m," was found pinned upon the wall
just above a large pool of blood on the
floor. The sentence, although written in
English, was unmistakably inscribed by
one who was accustomed to writing Ger
man ehnracters. He used a blue pencil.
Abiger stated to-day when the paper was
shown to him that he knew nothing what
ever about it, that he was not the writer
ana ho bad no idea who was. "Me Portu
guese fishermen who were tlÂ» first to
enter the house after the affair found tbe
bo('y huddled in a heap beside the door.
Justice Michaeliu, v?ho wa3 summoned
from Monterey, fouud when he arrived
late at night that the body lay in aheap
in the corner, about three feet away. The
Portuguese declare they did not touch it.
Joan Freitas, the Carmelito saloon
keeper, who was the second man to whom
Abiger went for aid, said that it was be
tween 8 and 9 o'clock tl at he heard the
shot that killed Count Ballestrem fired.
About rive minutes before Abiger came to
his house. Abiger seemed /nuch excited,
but not as though he had been drinking
at all. He knew Abiper sometimes drank
wine, but had never seen him intoxicated
as long as the artists uad been there.
"I went to Bdllestrem's house soon
after Abiger came over to my saloon,"
said Freiia*. 'I found the Count's body
on the kitchen floor near the table. I
a^ked Abii.er how it all happened, but he
was so excited that he would tell me
hardly anything. 1 was scared, so I did
not go inside the house, but I could see
just how the body lay on the floor. I
then went home, and it was a long while
before Judge Michaelis arrived. We went
over together a&jain."
To a question by one of the jurors as to
when he last saw Ballestrem alive, Freitas
said he was passing the house about 4
o'clock .that afternoon when he saw the
Count painting inside. His wife had told
him that tho Count was at the saloon
about 6 o'clock in the afternoon. On tbe
night of the shooting he bad very little
conversation with Abiger. All Abiger
would say was that he shot his partner.
John Veriera stated to the jury that he
heard the shot between 7 and 8 o'clock.
About three minutes later Abiger knocked
at his door and told him that be had shot
nis partner. Veriera told his friend Manuel
to go and report the affair. He then went
over to the Count's house with Abiger.
"I was scared," he said, "but went over
nnyway. Abiger had the shotgun then
with him, but gave it to me; then i was
not so scared. When I reached the house
1 placed the gun on, the outside against
the wall and went in. I saw 1 could not
help tbe dead man, so went back home.
1 always knew the men to be on tbe best
of terms and never heard a word between
them."
Justice Micnaalis of this place, when
called to the stand, said, in substance :"I re
ceived word about 10 o'c ock by telephone
from the Hatton ranch in Carmel Valley,
but it was about 11:45 before Constable
Hernandez and I reached the hut. Abiger
was walking outside and holding a lantern,
but wben we approached tbe place he
went into the house. I called to him
twice, but received no answer. Getting
out of the buggy, I went to a window and
could see him in a rear room. He had no
gun with him then, and bad nothing in
his band, so 1 went around to the side
door and entered. 'What, in heaven's
name, have you done?' I a kfd All he re
plied was: 'There he is, and he is dead.
We had a friendly tuzzle with the gun
and it was loaded and went, off' "
"Judt'e Michaelis," said Coroner Gor
don, "Will you please state to the jury
just where you found the deceased? "
"I fuund Count Ballestrem all huddled
up in one corner of the room, with a coat
over bis head- I asked Abiger where the
gun was, but he said he did not know. I
looked around the rooms for it, but did
not succeed in finding it. Then I went
outside and found it lyin^ on the ground
near the building, and at tbe fiont of tbe
house. I brought it inside, and upon ex
amining it found there were no cartridges
in the gun. I also noticed ringer marks
on both the barrel and the stock of the
gun. There was clay on the hands of the
dead Count, too, showing that he must
have had hold of the gun. I found on the
floor the remnants of the clay moid
which the Count was making that after
noon, i
"I made a thorough search of the house
to find any evidence of wilful murder, but
could not. I found a lot of letters and
papers belonging to the Count. Most of
the letters were from his sister, and there
was one from his mother, all, of course,
written in German. On the table in the
kitchen I round twenty-three empty car
tridges and three loaded ones. The demi
john of claret was also on the table, but it
was about half empty.
"1 first knew the Count about three
years ago, when he wa* on his first visit
to Monterey, and have known him very
intimately ever since lie has been at Point
Lobos. I have slept there often and never
heard an an cry word pass between the
two men. He did not have any money,
but I knew him to be expecting a remlt
ance of about 2000 marks from his sister
this week. I know Abiger was very ex
cited when I entered the house, but I can
not|say that he was intoxicated."
The jury was out about ten minutes and
brousht in a verdict that Count yon
Ballestrem came to his death from "a
gunshot wound inflicted by Cnarles
Abiger, accidentally, and we do hereby
exonerate Charles Abiger."
WAS ONCE A BOOTBLACK.
Count ron Ballestrem't Strange Career
in ISnn Francisco.
Count Wolfgang yon Baliestrem was
quite well-known in the Mission district,
where, at the corner of Sixteenth street, he
prospered as a popular bootblack and
house whitewashes
Eight months ago Yon Ballestrem joined
the Mission Turn Verein, just prior to his
departure for the south. With him he
tooK a demit card entitling him to join
another Turn Verein wherever he might
choose to locate.
The question of Yon Ballestrem's death
was the topic of conversation at tbe hail of
the Mission Turn Verein last night. No
one knew tbe man intimately, but every
body knew him in a general way.
He was known as a free and Jbig-hearted
fellow who received periodical remittances
from bis family in Europe, which money
he promptly proceeded to squander in
drink.
He did a little scenic painting for the
Tivoli, and when his unreliable and fret
ful spirit caused him to lose his position
there, he wandered over to San Pablo.
There he became acquainted with a
Spanish woman of some means, married
her, and after squandering her money he
left her with their three little children.
At one time during his early career in
this country Count yon Ballrstrem served
as a private soldier in the United States
army, having enlisted at the Presidio.
A German paper publishes a statement
to the effect that the Count was once a
lieutenant in tbe German army. Certain
swindling operations caused him to leave
his home about fifteen years ago and come
to this country.
SECRECY IS STAMPED OUT
Delegates to ihe Typographical
Coovention Sworn to Sup
press the Wahnetas.
It Is Now B3lieved That Nothing
Further Will Be Heard of the
Objectionable Ordsr.
COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., Oct. 12.â
Tbe forty-third session of the Typograph
ical Union convened in biennial session
in this city this morning. There is an
attendance of 200 delegates, representing
every section of the country. President
Prescott presided, and selected minor offi
cials from among Colorado Springs print
ers. Committees were appointed on va
riouÃ lines of business.
Delegate Eugene F. O'Rourke of New
York arose at the opening and declared
that he had positive proof that there is in
existence in the union a secret body known
as the Wahnetas, and which is the old
Brotherhood revived. This Brotherhood
was started many years ago, and had as
its object tbe controlling of work in the
various cities, discriminating against those
not members. It was thought to have
been stamped out many years ago.
Delegate O'Rourke presented a resolu
tion requiring that every officer and dele
gste in the body be required to take an
ironclad oath that from that time forth he
would not belong to any body which
sought to control the legislation of the
union and that he would use all his
power to break up any such league.
Every delegate took tbe oath and then
the ex-delegates present took it. Many of
those who took it are known to have been
active workers in the secret order. It is
believed by the delegates that it is now
fully stamped out. A resolution calling
for n committee to report on a shorter
hour system was introduced. A Half day
was spent in business and the afternoon
was taken up in a drive to the Garden of
the Gods, Manitou Springs and other
scenic points.

bassador Bayard, dated London, Septem
ber 30. Mr. Bayard repudiates the Chicago
platform and nominees and supports
Palmer and Buckner. The letter in part
says:
It 6eems scarcely posslDle that any one
could be in doubt in relation to my personal
opinion upon the very serious issues now
placed before our countrymen by the ma
chinery of the several political organizations.
When a citizeu professing himself to be a
Democrat is called upon by many or by few
to yield his convictions and assent to the doc
trine that Congress has the power and rignt
fully exercises It by its legislative fiat to
create values, and regardless of their
intrinsic or commercial value to invest
one or other of the earth's metals with
'an arbitrary power as money and over
ride and alter at legislative will or caprice the
ratio of exchangeability of such metal, re
gardless of the impairment of obligations, his
answer shoull be that such a claim of power
is not consistent with a government of limited
powers, as defined by our constitution, but
contains the quintessence of tyranny, dis
honesty Bnd absolutism, and is destructive of
that morality which Is essential to the peace
and stability of civilized society. It is,
la plain words, a proposition to de
stroy the institution of property and
break down every legal defense for
us maintenance. This one question, and It is
answered sufficiently, justifies the prompt and
absolute refusal of a constitutional Democrat
to support in any degree the nominees of the
Chicago convention, Messrs. Bryan and Se
wail, and the preposterous claims of legislation
contained in their platform under which the
credit of the Nation and the peace and order
of society would inevitably perish.
On the other hand, we have the Republican
organization, whose measures and whose lead
ers have steadily combated such a ticket and
such propositions as were presented at Chi
cago. While compelled to recoil from the
policy of compulsory purchase and coinage of
sliver as an unlimited legal tender, yet it is
Insistently proposed to employ and inten
sify the prolound powers of pub
lic taxation to prohibit commerce
with other countries. and thereby
prevent money from coming into the public
treasury, to levy taxes which shall prevent
the payment and collection of other taxes
necessary for the support of the Governmmt,
whose powers are exerted directly and per
sonally upon each individual citizen and over
every part of the land or water within its
National boundaries.
Every constitutional Democrat can truly
reply to such propositions that ihey are
fraught with such gross inequality between
man and man as is inconsistent with public
safety because it employs the most far
reaching and sovereign power known to the
Government to impoverish the working and
poorer members of society (who form the great
majority) and aggrandize those financially
stronger. Every Democrat taithful to the
principles of his party can properly refuse to
aid the selection of candidates avowing prin
ciples and policies that have so plainly led to
our present dangers and which are manifestly
fatal to the welfare of our country. But, hap
pily, there remains a citadel and
an asylum for the conscience of
any man honestly convinced thnt
the path of duty leads him to keep steadily in
view the great purposes for which our fathers
ordained the constitution of the United
Statesâ the formation of a more perfect Union,
the establishment of justice, the insurance of
domestic tranquility, promotion of the wel
fare and the security of liberty to ourselves
and our posterity.
Happily candidates are presented upon a
clour and unambiguous placform that assures
safety to the financial honor of our country â
to the honest business transactions of all its
citizens without discrimination of age, sex or
color. The personamputatlon of the candidates
of the National Democracy, Palmer and Buck
ner, is unsullied and guarantees their fidelity
to their pledges, and their election would go
far to re-establish the moral health of our
country. I hope and u*uÃt that in every State
of the Union an electoral and Congressional
ticket will be put before ihe people that every
citizen may record his vote according to his
conscientious belief and in support of those
principles essential to the maintenance of the
Government of our best and dearest hopes.

BRYAN TALKS
AT MINNEAPOLIS
Great Crowds Turn Out to
Hear the Orator of
the Platte.
Four Speeches Made, One of
Which Is Exclusively for
tin Women.
NO TIME TO DWELL ON TAKIFF
Toiges Ex-Senator Washburn's De
m md and Continues to Plead
for Cheap Money.
MINNEAPOLIS, Mi>*n., Oct. 12.âPer
fect Indian summer weather, neither too
cool nor too warm, aided the Minneapolis
supporters of W. J. Bryan to-night to
outdo in their efforts their brethren of 3t.
Paul in givine a rousing welcome to the
silver Democratic standard bearer. St.
Paul had been unfortunate in a murky,
chilly day, and there could not have
been a greater contrast than that
between the atmospheric conditions
of the two evenings. And the Minneapo
lis silver people rose to the occasion. Like
their political friends of their sister city,
they had arranged for no less than four
speeches by Mr. Bryan, and fortune was
with them again in this, for the Chicago
nominee felt strong of voice and body
after his two days of rest and was able to
speak with his old-time vigor.
Minnesota women do not have the right
of suffrage except in school elections, but
a special meeting for the benefit of as
many of them as could crowd into the
Lyceum Theater was addressed by Mr.
Bryan. That was tbe unique feature of
the Minneapolis demonstration. No men
Were to be admittedâ not one of them, ex
cept the young Nebraska candidateâ but a
few of tie sterner sex managed to obtain
entrance to hear what Mr. Bryan would
say to a honse full of ladies. The prin
cipal address of the nominee, however,
was delivered at the Exposition build ing*
and the others in the open air. The hot
fight being waged for free coinage in tms
Slate served to intensify the interest in
Bryan's coming, and the ardent silver
men of Minneapolis did their utmost to
make themselves felt and heard from the
time he entered the city until he went to
bed on the speciai car in which he will
travel to Duluth to-morrow to give aid to
Congressman C. A, Towne, silver man
and protection Republican, who is making
a fight for re-election with the indorse
ment of the Democrats and Populists.
Mr. and Mrs. Bryan reached the West
Hotel in Minneapolis, accompanied by
Congressman Town**, John W. Tomlinson
of Alabama and others prominent in the
silver cause, at 4 o'clock. They made the
trip from St. Paul, where the day was
spent, in a special trolley car. A big
crowd gathered in front of the West Hotel
and Mr. Bryan was cheered to the echo.
He apd. Mrs. Bryan went almost imme
diately to the home of State Senator S. B.
Howard, editor of the Penny Press, and
had dinner there wiih a small company.
Then they returned to the West Hotel to
prepare* for the efforts of the evening.
Crowds began to gather about the Expo
sition buildine a c urde of hours before
tbe hour set for Mr. Bryan's appearance
thereâ 7:3o o'clockâ and every seat in the
body of the Auditorium was soon filled.
No overcrowding was allowed, and soon
after the 8300 seats in tne hall were filled
the doors were closed, not quickly enoueh,
however, to keep out about 100 of those
who were willing to stand. Two hun
dred old soldiers of the Veterans'
Bryan Club of Minneapolis formed
the escort of the candidate, from the West
Hotel to the Auditorium. When they ar
rived at the entrance to the building with
their charge an exciting scene was taking
place. Thosa who had been unable to
obtain admittance had become a strug
gling, excited mob. The crowd could
move neither out nor in. It was only by
the combined efforts of the police and
those with them that Mr. Bryan wa3
forced through the crowded masses of
humanity and enabled to enter the build
ine.
The entrance of the old soldiers was the
cue to those within that Bryan was near,
and the veterans were cheering with vigor.
Then came the candidate, fresh and
smiling, accompanied by Congressman
Towne, ex-Congressman Williams of
Illinois, State Senator Howard and others.
Floor and gallery rose, and flags, hand
kerchiefs and hats* were waved to the ac
companiment of the wildest cheering,
which lasted five minutes. When the
enthusiasm had ceased ex-Mayor P. B.
Winston called the meeting to order and
introduced E. C. Marchard, who presented
to the candidate an inkstand, sixteen parts
silver and one gold, on behalf of the labor
ing men of Minneapolis.
When Mr. Bryan roue to reply another
demonstration "occurred, and throughout
his speech there were frequent outbursts
of applause. It was supposed that he
would have something to Bay about Arch
bishop Ireland's letter against the Chicago
ticket and platform, but he made no refer
ence to it. He did, however, talk about
another distinguished Minnesotan, Hon.
W. D. Washburn, on the basis of a letter
received from the ex-Senator. Groans and
cheers were frequent during his reply to
the wealthy miller. The emotional, ex
cited throng outside the Exposition
building had become tired of pushing,
shoving and elbowing, and had drifted off
in segments to the adjacent bridge square
to join the great crowd already gathered
there. It was to these that Mr. Bryan de
livered his second address from a balcony
of the Exposition building. His audience
was estimated atls,oGo.
The ladies' meeting at the Lyceum came
next. Nine o'clock was the hour set for
Mr. Bryan's appearance, but he was more
than an hour late. Mrs. Bryan was there.
The meeting was presided over by Mrs.
C. A. Schaefer, whose husband's father
was the law partner for twenty-one years
of Bryan's father at Salem, 111. When she
presented the candidate the ladies
shrieked and waved an enthusiastic wel
come.
The last address was at Yale place,
where another bi_' crowd had gathered.
The speech of the evening was delivered
at the Auditorium. There was little new
in it except tbe answer to Senator Wash
burn. After returning thanks for the
kind reception extended him, Mr. Bryan
saia he advocated bimetallism because he
believed it was a good thing for the labor
ing man of the country, and continued as
follows:
I have received a letter dated October 12
and signed by W. D. Washburn, who is, 1 un
derstand, an ex -Senator from this State.
[Hisses and groans.] In this letter be asks
me Certain questions about my vote and
action in the House of Representatives on the
tariff bill, for which I refer him to the Con
gressional Record, But when he asks me to
enter into a discussion of the tariff
question I tell him that there is a ques
t.c.i before the American people which
is far more important than the tariff
question. There is a question which
can be settled now ; the tariff question can be
settled any time. If he wants me to discuss
tariff, I tell him to join with me in a pro
hibitory duty on foreign financial policies
and then I will discuss the rest of the schedule.
[Great cheering.] Or, if he is not willing to
discriminate against that foreign product by a
prohibitory duty, 1 will ask him to wait until
he has settled the money question by Inter
national agreement and then submit the tariff
question to International agreement.
LaDoring men, I waut to ask you why It is
that every goldbug says that you are selfish
and that you are influenced by selfish consid
erations, while every goldbpg pretends to be a
phi.anthropist who simply loves honest money
because it will help other people? [Laughter
and cheers.] I want lo kuow why it is that
these goldbu&rs aro so sorry that everybody
else wili be influenced by personal interests
and so positive that personal interests cannot
affect them. [Apy ause.] Why is it? I will
tell you why: If a man believes a thing is
good fr>r himself and also good for others, he
will admit tbat it is good for himself. If he
thinks a thing good ior himself, but bad for
others he will never admit that it is good for
himself. [Cheers.] Tnat is the rule 1 lay
down and you can examine it and apply it to
every. day life. You will find that ni*n never
deny that a thing is good for them if they also
believe it is good for others. It is only when
they believe that they prosper by others' ad
versities that you hear them standing up and
denying that they have any pecuniary beue
fit. [Applause.]
Mr. Bryan then spoke of the reasons
which laboring men, farmers and business
men gave lor wanting bimetallism, com
paring their reasons with those of the ad
vocates of the gola standard.
The rest of Mr. Bryan's speech was a
reiteration of his former arguments on the
money question.
PALMER AND RUCKNER.
They Make Tiaorou* IJenuneiations of
the Chicago Pint form.
DETROIT, Mich., Oct. 12. â Generals
Palmer and Buckner delivered addresses
before an audience of 2500 persons at the
Auditorium here this afternoon. Both
speakers were warmly welcomed. General
Buckner being received with great enthu
siasm. Each candidate spoke for about
an hour and was frequently interrupted
by applause. General Palmer was the first
speaker. He said in opening that he had
been used to attacking Presidential can
didates, but lie was now compelled to ba
decorous and decent. He said that he and
his partner represented in some degree
a restored union, and that the prin
ciples they represented were those for
restored nationality and patriotism. He
said* that whatever the result of the
impending election, from this time
forth National ambition will be open to
men of the North, the South, tbe East and
the West, and that nereaiter the young
men will have a chance in National poli
tics. His party was the representative of
pure Democratic opinions. The conven
tion at Chicago which called itself Demo
cratic had no other claim than that it
claimed to be Democratic. It had been
controlled by influences entirely strange
to the Democratic party, he- said, and he
charged that there had been a distinct
understanding among the leaders of the
Chicago conventiou that the Populist ana
Free Silver parties would nominate Mr.
Bryan. The mention of Mr. Bryan's
name brought forth applause and cheers
from the free silver contingent in the
audience.
General Palmer then discussed the
money question. He declared that the
whole theory upon which free coinage
rests is an experiment. He himself did
not know whether the free coinage of sil
ver would raise the commercial value of
the bullion in a dollar to 60. 70, 80, 90 or
100 cents â neither did Mr. Bryan and his
followers; and he assertea that free coin
age would be a ruthless experiment upon
the business of the country. He did
know, however, that the silver dollar
could wot be made worth tbe present gold
dollar. He declared that there was no
want of money in this country, and at the
present time money was the cheapest he
had ever known it to be. Business men
were not buying it, however, as they
cannot invest it profitably, and lenders
cannot afford to take a risk under existing
political conditions.
In closing he said the Chicago conven
tion had no right to declare that to be
Democratic which is not Democratic, and
said he would prefer a sensible monarchy
to the rule of the framers of the Chicago
platform.
When General Buckner was introduced
many in the audience rose to their feet
and cheered. Ha discussed the principles
of the different parties, and declared that
the principles of Jefferson are the
principles the National Democracy is ad
vocating, and these principles cannot be
changed without the fall of this Govern
ment. He defended the right of the Gov
ernment to enforce its laws, and said it
was because the Government did not en
force the laws relating to the Southern
States that the latter seceded.
He charged the Republican party with
issuing the fiat paper money which, be
claimed, is the cause of ail the present
trouble. He declared that tbe delegates
to the Chicago convention had been in
structed to adopt a Democratic platform,
but they had trampled down the princi
ples of Democracy and left not a plank,
and in lieu of such they had adopted a
set of Ponulistic principles which the
Democratic party have been combating
for 100 years. He attacked the Federal
interference and Government injunction
planks and applauded the courts for en
joining Debs and his followers, and Presi
dent Cleveland for sending troops into
Chicago. He then went into- a discussion
of the money question, followed closely on
tbe line of argument used by General
Palmer.
Not more than 1000 persons were pres
ent at the close of the meeting.
ALIGELD WILL SPEAK
Beady to Deliver an Address at Madi
son-Square Garden.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 12.â Governor
Altgeld will deliver a political speech in
New York City next Saturday night. This
wiil be the last speech he will make dur
ing the campaign outside of Illinois. This
speech will be given at the earnest wisji of
prominent Eastern Democratic leaders.
The Governor will speaK at Madison
square Garden. German-Americans, labor
ing men and Tammany Hail members will
be specially invited to hear him.
Chairman Campau of the Democratic
campaign committee left Chicago to-night
for Duluth, where he will join Mr. Bryan,
ana he will remain w.ltn the nominee
during the tour through Wisconsin and
Michigan.
Mr. Walsh of the Democratic National
Committee declared to-day, in refutation
of the Republican claim that lowa will
give McKinley a majority, that he had in
liia possession a complete poll of the State,
finished during the last week, showing
that Bryan will carry lowa by not less
37,000 majority. The poll is said to show
a Republican defection toward Bryan in
every county, running from 50 to 1200 to a
county. Tne poll shows 42,000 Republicans
for Bryan, the Republican poll conceding
20,000 silver Republicans.
Chairman Campau has received a letter
from General William Birney, the Aboli
tionist and Republican, whose father was
twice the candidate of the Abolition party
for President. He declares he cannot
stand on the financial plank of the Repub
lican platform and denounces the gold
standard as the commercial curse of the
country.
VICTORY IS NOT ASSURED.
Leaders bay That McKinlty and Bohart
Cannot tie Beaten.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 12.-The fol
lowing statement was given out at Na
tional Republican Headquarters to-day
after a conference of the entire National
executive committee:
"The election of AicKinley and Hobart
is an accomplished and assured fact. They
will receive 270 electoral votes. Bryan
will receive 110, and there are six States
having sixty-seven electoral votes which
are doubtful, but the probabilities all
point to the fact that these sixty
seven votes will go into the Repub
lican column and be added to the 270
now assured for McKinley and Hobart
This is the status to-day. We have the
election, and will hold it. Our effort in
the West is to this end only. The opposi
tion has abandoned the East,"
NOT SATISFIED
WITH HUNTINGTON
English Stockholders of the
Central Pacific Heard
From.
Displeased With the Arrange
ments Made for the Payment
of Dividends.
ARE OUT WITH A CIRCULAE.
Facts Come to Light Which Imperil
the Interests of British Se
ennty Ho:dirs.
NKWYORK, N.Y.,0ct.12.â The Times
to-morrow morning will say:
Some of the English stockholders of the
Central Pacific Railroad have joined in a
public manifestation of dissatisfaction
with the existing condition of affairs.
They are displeased with C. P. Hunting
ton's management and particularly dis
pleased with the arrangement that he
made with representatives of the British
interest two years ago for the payment of
dividenas. This dividend agreement was
put in tne form of a contract, and it pro
vides that a dividend of one-half of 1 per
cent on tbe Central Pacific stock shall be
paid in January and July until a satisfac
toiy adjustment of the company's debt to
tho United States Government is reached.
After such adjustment the dividend rate
is to be increased to 2 per cent per annum
for a guaranteed period of two years.
A circular, signed by W. Morehead ol
London and F. G. Longton of Liverpool,
has reached this city, In which the dissat
isfied stockholders say: "This dividend
is only half of tbat which was found suffi
cient to quell the English agitation in
1883. So matters rest for the present,
but facts have recently come to light in
connection with the inner history of the
company during tbe past two years, which,
in our judgment, seriously affect and im
peril the interests of the English share
holders. A meetiug'will shortly be con
vened in London, when a statement of
facts will be presented to the holders who,
like ourselves, are dissatisfied with the
present directors and committee of stock
holders."
ABRA IGNED BY COCKRAN.
Arguments of Bryxn and Altgeld Are
Torn to Shreds.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 12.â Between 6000
and 7000 people to-night heard Bourke
Cockran at the Coliseum, when he replied
to the speech recently delivered by Gov
ernor Altgeld in which the Illinois execu
tive answered the arguments advanced by
Carl Schurz and Mr. Cockran.
The speaker was in excellent voice and'
was heartiiy cheered when he stepped on
the platform. After the audience had
sung "America" the New York orator
said:
I am at the outset confronted with the diffi
culty which always besets me when I study a
Populistic production. lam always at a loss
to Know just what tbe Populist means and of
the injuries from which he is supposed to be
suffering. The difference between a Populist
and a Democrat is this, a^d I might add bc
tweeirt, a Populist and a sensible man: A
sensible man first makes sure of his facts and
then proceeds to talk on them. The Populist
begins to talk, continues to talk, and never
takes any pains to ascertain the facts about
which he is talking.
If there can be any reason for this Popu
listic propaganda whatever which is now
sweeping across the country, championed by
Bryan and Altgeld, it must be that somebody
is to be benefited at the expense of somebody
else.
While at Wheeling Jast Thursday, the
same day that Mr. Bryan was there, he
said he left behind him a question which
would test the valae of his theories. It
was this: "How can you propose to raise
the price of commoditi-s and benefit the
workingmen if you don't make provision
to increase his wages?" Mr. Bryan's
answer, said Mr. Cockran, was: "Those
who are propounding these questions are
the agents of trusts and syndicates and
generally disreputable persons."
In speaking on the distress and financial
condition now existing, he said: "I say
the paralysis in this country as it exists
does not come from the gold standard,
but from attempts to overthrow it."

DEFEATS MURPHY
Makes More Points in the
Fight for the Bantam
Championship.
The Englishman Declared the
Victor at the Close of the
Twentieth Round.
JOHNNY CLEARLY OUTCLASSED
But the Yankee Lad Struggled Bravely
and Won Some Applause From
the Britons-
LONDON, Eno., Oct. 12.â The fight be
tween Peddlar Palmer of England and
Johnny Murphy of Boston for the bantam
championship of the world took place to
night at the National Sporting Club and
vras won by Palmer. Both men were in
excellent condition and each weighed
114J4 pouuds. Pal#ner was a good favorite
in the betting at odds of 9 to 4 on him.
The Englishman forced the fighting
from the start. He was much the quicker
in his deliveries and hustled Murphy
around the ring in lively style. In the
first two rounds Murphy failed to land a
single good blow. Nevertheless he stood
up bravely and took punishment plucfcily
as Palmer rained blows upon him with his
right and left. The plucky Yankee boy
was heartily applauded.
In the third round Murphy landed once
or twice, but did no apparent damage to
his opponent. Murphy started in the
fourth round with more advantage, but he
was terribly slow. Round after round
Palmer rushed Murphy about the ring,
bur. the American did not show that he
had been punished much until the end of
the twelfth round. Then he went to his
corner very tired.
Before time was called, however, he
pulled himself to?ether and made a splen
did fight in the thirteenth round. Despite
his pluck he was too terribly battered to re
cover permanently, and Palmer had the
battle in hand to the finish.
At the end of the twentieth round
Palmer was declared the winner on points.
Murphy was not knocked out. Palmer's
seconds were Baxter and FiizpatricK,
while Craig and Solly Smith acted in a
similar capacity for Murphy.
WOLCOTS WHIPS "SCALDE."
Q-.iinn Receives Hurt-re Punishment From
the Colored Pug.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 12.â 1n the
Woicott-"Scaldy Biil" fight at Maspeth
to-night Wolcott was given the decision
in the seventeenth round.
Two good bouts were provided by the
management. The opening was a ian
round go between Dick O'Brien of Boston :
and Dick Moore of St. Paul. The main
attraction was a twenty-round contest be
tween Joe Wolcott, the colored welier
weigJit champion, and William Quinn,
better known as "Scaldy Bill," of the
Pennsylvania coal regions, a colored
prodigy.
O'Brien seemed to have Moore at his
mercy in the first round, but Moore came
to in the second round and puncned his
man pretty hard. O'Brien came up prelty
fresh in the third round and they mixed
things up in great style. Moore was tired
when the bell rang. O'Brien had the best
of the fourth round. Both men indulged
in hard lighting in the fiftn round, until
O'Brien sent in a right cro3.s on the jaw,
which sent Moore to grass, and the reieree
counted him out.
Wolcott was tne first to appear in the
main bout. He was seconded by howie
Hodginc, Tommy Connelly and Tim Col
lins. "Scaldy Bill" was looked after by
Charley White, Sam Bolen and Jim John
son. They were scheduled to go twenty
rounds at 148 pounds. "Scaldy" was
nearly a head taller than his antagonist.
Wolcott punched nis man and forced the
fighting from the start. It was a terrific
"go." Joe rushed at his man and landed
hard let swings on the body, bringing the
right round on the head. "Scaldy" never
winced and sent in a couple ol wild swings
on Joe's budy.
"Scaldy' : was very nearly gone when
the bell rang in the seebnd. It was a
grand tight. Wolcott was after his man
iike a demon in the third and twice sent
him staggering against the ropes. Bill
landed two terrific swings that staggered
Wolcott and the ciowd howled.
In the fourth, filth and sixth Wolcott
had tae best of it, but "Scaldy" took liis
punishment without flinchin^.wiiiie both
carried on an animated dialogue.
â  Id tLe seventh the terrific punishment
seemed to be having its effect on Bill, al
, though lie iandec! two rippers that nearly
sent Wolcott oft hit; feet. The eighth was
much the same.
Wolcott came up smiling in the ninth,
and they mixed things up witn terrific
swings. "Snaidy" was getting groggy
when the bell rang. Wolcott in tne
tenth punched his man all over the
ring. "Scaldy" was game to the
core and took nis punishment like a glut
ton. It seemed as if no man could stand
the uppercuts and punches on the jaw and
body that Wolcott rained in the eleventh.
Again the bell only just saved "Scaidy"
in the twelfth. Three times in the thir
teenth Wolcott sent hiu man down, but
Bill managed to stay out the time.
"Scaldy" was groggy in the fourteenth
and fifteenth and took punishment in an
extraordinary way. Woicott Knocked his
man down again in tne sixteenth, but
could not put him out.
"Scaldy" was completely dazed In the
seventeenth, and after Joe had sent him
down three times the referee stopped the
brutal exhibition and gave Wolcott the
decision.
REPLY TO HOWARD GOULD.
English Xachtumen Kay They Did Sot
Intend Any Discourtesy.
LONDON, Enq., Cct. 12.â A meeting
of the Yacht j Racing Association was held
this evening at which was drafted the fol
lowing reply addressed to the council â , by
Howard Gould, owner of the yacht
Niagara, protesting against the action of
the committee of the association in board
ing and examining the Niagara in May
last in the absence of Mr. Gould and with
out giving him previous notice of their in
tention, â  : . .
Sir: lam directed by the council of the
Yacht Racing Association to acknowledge re
ceipt of a letter from you dated September 20.
I am to reply that the visit ol their committee
was made in the usual course solely in conse
quence of the official measurer having in May,
1896, in the execution of his duty reported to
the council that the yacht's water tanks were
constructed together in f such a manner that
ihey might be used in shifting ballast,
i Notice of , such vlaks Is never given. The
â committee expected to find you on board, but
flaring irom the captain that you baa gone to
"London a few minutes previously, they re
quested permission to inspect the water tanks,
â : which was given. Their observation confirmed
the report of the measurer, and they recom
mended to you in writing . that the tanks
should be disconnected, at the same time ex
pressly disclaiming any imputation that the
tanks were actually pat to other use. The
council fail to see that any discourtesy was
displayed toward you; certainly none was in
tended. It is not necessary to enter into dis
cusiion of the other points in your letter. As
you have thought tit to mate your grievance
public, it is proposed that this rep'y pass
through the same channel. Diion Kemp.

STAFFORD'S TRAINING TABLE.
Taraity Football Men Will Confine Them
selves to Plain Fare.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Oct.
12. â Stanford's recent game with the
Olympics was as satisfactory to Coach
Cross as to Captain Fickert. The former
remarked before the game that if the San
Francisco eleven could play the game
they were said to be capable of his own
team would be beaten. He was gratified,
therefore, that the Stanford piayers were
able to hold their opponents to a tie.
"Some of our boys played better ball
than I had expected, and possibly, on ihe
whole, the team showed up a trifle
stronger than I believed they would in the
match; but, altogether, the play was
pretty close on the plane I had mapped
out."
Cross was well satisfied with the work of
the Stanford backs, but says that they do
not work well together yet in interfering
for the runner, nor do they all start on
the instant and hit the line in a bunch
when the signal is given for a bnck by one
of their number. This he will give special
attention to, and he will also endeavor to
impress on the ends the responsibility
resting on them and the danger of being
drawn in by an opposing runner.
The training table will be started next
Monday, with from fifteen to eighteen
players on, and the number will gradually
be increased as individual men show their
ability and the time of the big game
draws near. Last year there were thirty
men at the table when the season ended.
Cross says that in Yale the table starts
with the opening of regular practice and
the old Varsity players are the first men
put down. Then the number is augmented
throughout the season, the same as is
dove here.
Racing at Petaluma.
PETALUMA. Cal., Oct. 12.â The un
finished races of the San Rafael Hunt
Club meeting, postponed from last Satur
day, were decided here to-day. In the
match trotting race between H. E. Wise's*
bay mare Madera and J. J. Crooks' black
horse Bay Enra, Madera won the finishing
heat. She was driven by Holbrook. Dick
Harvey drove Bay Rum. Time, 2:18%.
H. E. Wise's Billy Patsy won the decidi. g
heat of the pacing match with Rudolph
Spreckels' Marguerite.
FUNERAL OF A BANK ROBBER.
The Grave Was Not Filled In and the
Coffin Frequently Opened for the
Purpose of Identification.
SHERBURNE, Minn., Oct. 12.â Sunday
was a day of funerals in Sherburne, as
Wc-ll as affording an opportunity for the
residents of the surrounding towns to look
at the scene of Wednesday's robbery and
the body of the dead robber. Several hun
dred from adjoining counties came in
during the day and gazed curiously at the
bank where the tragedy occurred. The
robber was buried at 11 o'clock this morn
ing. At least, the remains were taken to
the cemetery at the south side of town
and interred in the potter's field. The
grave was not filled in, however, and the
coffin was frequently opened during the
day for the purpose of identification.
When the coffin had been lowered in its
rough pine box Rev. G. J. Lutz, the local
Methodist pastor, spoke briefly on the
recent crime and its 3peedy vengeance.
Services for the dead cashier, George
Thorburn, were held at the Congrega
tional church this afternoon. The re
mains will be shipped to-morrow to Mon
treal.
FAIRMOUNT, Minn., Oct. 12. â The
second SherbuÂ»ne bank robber, who was
arrested at Lake Mills, lowa, arrived here
to-night and was placed in jail. The
militia will guard the jail all night. The
Marshal of Sherburne and a big delegation
of citizens are here, but there are no men
acing appearances. Fair mount jail now
has two murderers, one being Craft, who
killed his wife in a fit of jealousy about
nino months ago. The second is the Lake
Mills captive. No lear is entertained for
Craft, but mutterings have been heard in
the streets of Fairmount and Sherburne
to-day, and it is feared that indignant
citizens of Bancroft, lowa, may attempt to
avenge the death of Marshal Gallien.
Love and a Tragedy.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Oct. 12.â At 12:30
o'clock this morning Philip Zimmer, a
blacksmith, fatally shot Celia Veitz, his
sweetheart, at her home, and then shot
his sister, when he committed suicide
by shooting himself through the heart.
Zimmer and his sister called on the dead
girl and a quarrel over another young man
led to the tragedy.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 13, 1896.
LONDON'S LATEST
CASE OF SCANDAL
Lady Tina Scott Held for
the Libel of Earl
Russell.
Caused to Be Circulated Among
the English Aristocrats
a Pamphlet.
HER SON-IN-LAW OBJECTED.
But His Lordship Came Near Being
Accused of Serious Misconduct
in Winchester.
LONDON, Eno., Oct. 12.â Lady Tina
Scott; the mother of Countess Russell,
who was arrested on Friday and arraigned
on Saturday at the instance of her son-in
law, Earl Russell, who charged her with
criminal libel, was again arraigned in ?he
Bow-street Police Court to-day.
The courtroom wae crov;ded with spec
tators, many of whom moved in the high
est circles. A bookseller named Carrez
was called to the witness-stand and testi
fied that a Mrs. Franklin, who was con
ducting a massage establishment in the
rooms above his shop in Cranbourne
street, summoned him upstairs in August
last and introduced him to Lady Scott as
her (Mrs. Franklin's) sister. Lady Scott
paid him a sum of money to arrange
for the printing and distribution among
the members of the House of Lords, House
of Commons, the London newspapers,
clubs, etc., of a pamphlet containing libel
ous matter, which was signed by Cocker
ton and Kast, who were also arrested, ar
raigned and remanded in connection with
the case on Saturday, and also by one
Aylott, who is now a fugitive, having fled
to Algiers to escape arrest.
Charles Matthews, counsel for the prose
cution, said that Kast had endeavored to
I bring an action against Earl Russell in
the Winchester Court on Friday, intend
ing to accuse his lordship of having been
guilty of serious misconduct in Winches
ter in 1839, Dut at the last moment he
slunk away, allowing the case to be with
drawn upon technical grounds. Two
hours later, Mr. Matthews said, warrants
for the arrest of Lady Scott and Kast and
his accomplice, Cockerton, were obtained.
Lady Scott and the other defendants â
Frederick Kast, a groom, and John Cock
erton, a marine engineer â were committed
for trial in the Criminal Court â Old
Baileyâ under the same bonus as were im
posed upon them on Saturday â Â£2000 for
Lady Scott and Â£500 each for Kast and
Cockerton.
ARRIVES SAFE AT HALIFAX.
There Is No Longer Any Doubt Concerning
the Safety of the British Cruiser
Talbot.
HALIFAX, N. S., Oct. 12!â The British
cruiser Taibot, concerning the safety of
which startling rumors have been current
in London to-day, sailed into Halifax har
bor at 5 o'clock this afternoon.
She saluted the flag of Vice-Admlral
Erskine as she moved to her anchorage.
The Talbot sailed from Portsmouth Oc
tober 3, having been commissioned for
British North America and West India
station. She is one of Great Britain's
newest ships of war, and this is the tirst
time she has been in American waters.
The news from London that she was
reported to have foundered at sea created
intense excitement in naval circles here,
and also among the military. Three
hours after the sensational report was re
ceived from London the ship was sighted
off this port.
AM ENCOUNTER WITH RE RELS.
Spanish Troop* Mot Having All Their
Own Way in Cuba.
HAVANA, CrBA, Oct. 12. â General
Echave reports that on October 8 his com
mand hr.d a serious encounter with the
rebel forces, who held strong positions on
the heights of Guayabitos.
Alter a fight lasting three hours the
rebels were finally dislodged, despite their
tenacious defense, under the raking fire of
the Spanish artillery and a brilliant bay
onet charge by the Spaniards. Mateo, be
fore retreating to Camato ana Caiguanabo,
bnmed his own camp and fired five
cannon shots at the Spainards without
effect. The loss of the rebels is unknown.
The Spanish loss was fifteen men killed
and two lieutenant-colonels, four lieuten
ants and ninety-three men wounded by
bullets and machetes and five men badly
bruised. General Echague had his
wounded conveyed to Santiago de Cuba.
REPARATION DEMANDED,
Italy Addresses a Peremptory
Note to the Porte About a
Subject's Slaughter.
England and Russia Also Preparing
for an Emergency in the Turk
ish Question.
ROME, Italy, Oct. 12.â The Italian Gov
ernment has addressed a peremptory note
to the Porte with reference to a youns
Italian subject murdered in the recent
massacres in Constantinople. The note
says that the young man was beaten on
the head and felled to the ground by a
man in a Turkish uniform, who continued
to cudgel his prostrate victim until he Had
Killed him. The note concludes by de
manding the punishment of the guilty
persons and the payment of indemnity for
the murder of the Italian subjects.
LONDON, ENG.,Oct. 12.â An anti-Sultan
demonstration was held in Hyde Park yes
terday by the workingmen of London. The
weather was very cod and dull, but a
large number of persons took part in the
procession that formed on the Thames
embankment and marched thence to Hyde
Park, the line being fifty minutes passing.
Twelve platforms had been erected, and
among those who made addresses were
Henry Broadnurst, M. P.; John Burns,
the Socialist member of the Commons;
Edward H. Pickersgill, M. P.; James
Stuart, M. P. ; James H. Yoxall, M. P.,
and the Rev. Hugh Price Hughes.
They all denounced the Sultan for the
horrors of the massacre of his Christian
subjects. Resolutions were adopted call
ing upon the British Government to bring
increased pressure to bear upon the great
Powers to secure united action to prevent
the Sultan from continuing the "carnival
of blood."
The Daily Graphic will to-morrow pub
lish a dispatch from Sebastopol saying
that Russia is continuing her preparations
for an emergency. The local military
and naval forces at Sebastopol, Odessa
and Batoum have been mobilized. Gene
ral Bobrikoff, chief of the War Office
staff, recently arrived at Sebastopol, and
has held important conferences with the
local commanders. He has inspected the
garrison and arsenal and lias mapped out
a company of submarine engineers, who
have been ordered to hold themselves in
readiness to immediately embark upon a
gunboat. This gunboat is already loaded
with mines, shells and torpedoes. The
interior garrisons in Poland, Laurida and
Caucasus have received orders to be in
readiness at a moment's notice to board
special trains for ports on the Euxme.
BERLIN, Germany, Oct. 12.â The Lokai
Anzeiger has a dispatch from Constanti
nople saying that the anti-Sultan move
ment among the Softas (theological stu
dents) is growing. They have circulated
another revolutionary proclamation.
The dispatch adds that Nehmet Pasha,
an imperial aid, was shot yesterday at
the Yiidiz palace on suspicion that he
was implicated in the Young Turkey agi
tation.
Persistent stories are in circulation to
the effect that carts loaded with corpses
emerge at nit^ht from the Central Prison
and hurry off in the direction of the Bos
phorus. These victims are supposed to be
young Turks. French divers are refusing
to work in the Bosphoru3, owing to the
horrible collection of corpses that they
meet while pursuing their labors under
water.
CARELESS, TO SAY THE LEAST.
Arrest of County Clerk Knopf for Issuing
Registration Certificates at
Wholesale.
CHICAGO, 111.. Oct. 12,â County Clerk
Knopf was arrested this morning and
taken before Judge Payne on a charge of
indorsing fraudulent registration. The
specific charge against Knopf is
the issuance of over 2000 registra
tion certificates to minors without
direct older from court or any recognized
authority. The arrest caused excitement
in political circles. Knopf was placed un
der $1000 bonds to appear before Judge
Payne to-morrow morning and answer to'
a charge of malfeasance. His arrest was
made on affidavit of Morris Cohen, who is
in charge of naturalization manors of
the Democratic Central Committee.
Fully 2000 final certificates of naturaliza
tion in blank, but bearing the clerk's sig
nature and the official county court, are
in the possession of the committee. The
charge is made that the papers have been
misused, but the opportunity for making
citizens without the usual formal court
proceedings is apparent.
The certificates were found lying on a
desk in the County Commissioners' office,
where Judge Woods had been holding a
court of naturalization. Knopf admits
having signed and sealed the papers, but
simply for convenience, and says that
sucli action is common practice. Knopf
has been prominent in Republican politics
lor many years.
IN THE SUPREME COURT.
All the Justices Attend the
Opening and Call Upon
the President.
One of the Most Important Decisions
to Be Rendered Is in the Wright
Irrigation Case.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Oct. 12.â The
Supreme Court of the United States met
to-day at noon and opened the term of
1896-97. All the Justices were present. No
business was transacted to-day save to re
ceive motions for admissions to the bar.
When these were disposed of the court
adjourned and called at the White House
and paid their respects to President Cleve
land.
Tne distinguished Justices were accom
panied to the executive mansion by Attor
ney-General Harmon ana Solicitor-Gen
eral Conrad. Their greeting by the Presi
dent was cordial, but beyond interchange
of vacation reminiscences and personal
good wishes nothina of public interest
occurred at tne reception.
On the succeeding days of the week the
calendar will be cleared, but it is not ex
pected that any arguments will be heard
until next week when the cases that have
advanced for hearing will come up. There
are fifty-four of these already assigned for
place and the list will doubtless be in-
I creased upon motions to be made in the
coming week.
One of the first announcements from
the bench will be a derision in the Cali
fornia irrigation case, which was argued
and submitted last March. In this case it
will be remembered ex-President Harri
son appeared as counsel, and received
$10,000 for his share in the case.
The case involves the constitutionality
of what is known as the Wright irriga
tion act of the California Legislature.
On this act bonds were issued by vari
ous corporations and syndicates engaged
in irrigating immense tracts of land,
amounting to over $6,000,000 in the ag
gregate. As far as actual money is con
cerned it is the most important case which
has been before the court for many years.
The lower United States Court held that
the irrigation bonds were unconstitutional.
The stockbrokers ol New York, Chicago
and San Francisco, on information from
Washington, have been making a number
of deals in the bonds recently. Fortunes
will be made and lost on the deciaion.
SPEAKS TO WORKINGMEN
Ingtrtoll'a Season for Objecting to Free
Coinage of Silver.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 12.â Hon. Robert
G. Ingersoll spoke to 12,000 workingmen
in the stockyards district to-night.
The speaker objected to the free coinage
of silver because Englishmen could bring
their silver bullion to this country and
have it coined into American dollars free
of charge. He said the mine-owners would
not be benefited by free coinage, because
if the mints are opened to the world the
bullion value of silver will not be raised
one-tenth of 1 per cent.
The only semblance of disorder was the
prolonged hissing which greeted the
speaker's reference sarcastically to Gov
ernor Altgeld as Attorney-General in Bry
an's Cabinet.
WILL WATSON RETIRET
It la Smd Hit Roaignativn la Already
In Butler* Hands.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 12.â A morning
paper says: It is confidently predicted
among politicians thar Tom Watson, the
nominee of the Populists for Vice-Preai
dent. will resign.
It is believed that hi 3 resignation is now
in the hands of Chairman Butler and that
it will be presented at the meeting of the
National executive committee which has
been called for this morning at 10:30.
The members of the committee vfill not
talk on the subiect ol the meeting.
i
COLONEL EDDY
AT SANTA ROSA
Two Thousand People Hear
His Appeal for Honest
Currency.
Hon. F. A. Cutler's Democratic
Arguments Are Logically
Answered.
PARIY PLATFOBMS COMPARED.
Senators Stewart and Jones as Accom
plices in the "Crime of
1873"
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Oct. 12.â One of
the largest audiences faced by a campaign
speaker in California this year greeted
Colonel T. V. Eddy in the Atheneum
here to-night. As it had been extensively
advertised that Colonel Eddy would an
swer some of the statements of F. A. Cut
ler on Saturday night, the audience was
largely composed of the people who had
listened to the speech of Mr. Cutler and
the comparisons drawn by the speaker
were readily understood and loudly ap
plauded.
The meeting was called to order by
Major O. Fountain, chairman of the Mc-
Kinley and Hobart Club of Santa Rosa,
who introduced O. O. Weber as presiding
officer. Mr. Weber made a short and ap
propriate opening speech, and amid loud
and prolong cheering introduced Colonel
Eddy. The speaker said that the
magnificent audience before him
was a type of the audiences
that were gathering all over the
land, and that there must be some
profound reason for such gatherings; the
people must be apprehensive of some great
evil that might come upon the land. He
then pointed out the evil that might
come. He compared the two great party
platforms, showing the grave dangers that
could arise from an assault upon the
highest tribunal of the land; how the
avowed policy or the Democrats was to
reconstruct the Supreme Court, to pass a
law already declared unconstitutional bf
the highest court in the land. He ex
ploded the well-worn arguments of the
silverites that silver was the money of the
constitution by reading the passage in
that instrument upon the subject.
Eulogizing Senator Jbhn Sherman, Colo
nel Eddy read a list of those who voted in
Congress to stop the coinage of silver dol
lars and proved that John Sherman voted
against the bill, while Senators Stewart
and Jones not only voted in favor of the
aliened "crime of" 1873," but in 1874 both
made speeches in favor of the gold stan
dard.
Colonel Eddy spoke for nearly three
hours, the interest and enthusiasm grow
ing more intense as he proceeded, and
when he finally pointed to the draped pic
ture of William McKinley it needed no
words from the speaker to start the 2000
people present into a wild demonstration
of delight.
Several times during the early part of
the meeting the speaker was interrupted
by remarks from the audience, but he
turned the laugh upon the interrupter
each time with quick-witted answers that
created unbounded amusement in the au
dience and completely discomfited the
seeker after knowledge.
At the close of this unusual meeting a
patriotic woman in the audience arose to
her fact, waving the American flag in her
hand, and proposed three cheers for the
Republican party, which were given with
a will.
LOS ANGELES FUSION.
Detnoerata and Popnlista Complete Their
City Ticket.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Oct. 12.â The city
Democrats and Populists completed their
work to-day on a fusion basis, after much
wrangling and disorder and many expres
sions of distrust in both* conventions.
There was but one exception to the agree
ment on all the city offices. That was in
the Eighth Ward, its Democratic delegates

six cars filled with enthusiastic Popocrats.

sionists and with the Visalia band sup
plied plenty of music.
D. M. Adams, president of the Visalia
Bryon Club, called the meeting to order
and introduced Judge N. O. Bradley as
chairman. The Judge delivered a short
introductory speech and read a list of
seventy-five vice-presidents who had
been previously informed of their selection
and already occupied seats on the plat
form.
Senator White was in good voice and for
nearly two hours he discussed the issues
of the campaign, devoting himself prin
cipally to the silver question. At the con
clusion of the speech the meeting was ad
journed with three cheers for Bryan.
Senator White was entertained at the
Palace Hotel after the speaking. There a

twenty gentlemen were invited. The

CUTLER AT HEALDSBURG.
Touch** Lightly on the T.iriff in Hit
Political Address.
HEALDSBURG, Cal., Oct. 12.â Twelve
hundred Healdsburgers crowded into
Trtritts' Opera-house to-ni^ht to listen to
Fletcher A. Cutler, Democratic and Popu
list candidate for Congress in the First
District, discuss the political issues of the
day .
The ball bad been tastefully decorated
and the iusionists spared nothing to make
this the big demonstration of the cam
paign. The meeting was called to order
by J. J. Livernash and H. H. Pyne pre
sided.
Mr. Cutler devoted himself almost en
tirely to a discussion of the financial ques
tion, and said that free coinage of silver at
16 to 1 would- be a panacea for
all our ills. He touched lightly on
the tariff, handling this subject with
gloves, and said it was not an issue in the
campaign. He declared himself against
any and all funding bills, and said he was
in favor of the Nicaragua canal. The
work of the campaign is telling on him
and he appeared to disadvantage to-night.
BAKERSFIELD'S CAMPAIGN
Congressman Schoonmaker Speaha at a
Republican Meeting.
BAKERSFIELD, Cal., Oct. 12.â Local
Republicans held a large meeting here
this evening, at which Congressman
Schoonmaker of New Jersey was the prin
cipal speaker.
Chairman Scott of the County Com
mittee opened the meeting with a
short speech, in which he paid his
respects to Senator White, who spoke here
Saturday night. S. JS. Reed, who pre
sided over the assemblage, followed with
a short speech Â»nd then introduced Mr.
Schoonmaker, who spoke for an hour and
was frequently interrupted by applause.
He took the ground that the tariff was
the leading question of the campaign, and
that free silver waÂ« not the remedy for
the troubles which afflicted the country.
It was a plain, straightforward business
talK on business lines, and met the fiearty
approval of the laree throng.

MONTEREY, Cal., Oct. 12.â David

Slandera Archbishop Ireland.
SEATTLE, Wash., Oct, 12.â Editorially
discussing Archbishop Ireland's letter
advocating McKiniey's election, the Even
ing Times, published by Colonel A. J.
Blethen, formerly of Minneapolis, says:
It is charitable to this great preacher to
say that most unfortunate speculations
in real estate in what is known as the
interurban district, or seven miles of
territory lying between Minneapolis and
St. Paul, during the boom have placed
Archbishop Ireland completely in the
hands of the money power. What he has
written has undoubtedly been caused by
the demands of those who have been com
pelled to aid the Archbishop in his finan
cial distress.

COYOTE SCALP
BOUNTY FRAUDS
State Equalizers Order an
Investigation of All
Claims.
Possess Proof That Thousands
of Scalps Were Shipped
to California.
PERJURERS TO BE PROSECUTED
Tons of Wolf-Hide Presented to
County Clerks Within Three
Months.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Oct. 12. â The
State Board of Examiners met this morn
ing to decide upon some line of action to
be pursued in regard to the large mass of
coyote claims, which have been held in
abeyance for several months, and the fol
lowing resolution was adopted:
Whereas, A large number of coyote-scalD
claims, approved by Boards of Supervisors of
the various counties of this State, have been
filed â with the State Board of Examiners for
consideration and transmission to the Legis
lature with the board's recommendation;
and whereas, it has been charged that coyote
scalps have been imported- Into some oi the
counties from otner States and Territories, and
that grave .frauds have been committed In
procuring the approval of some of these claims;
therefore be it
Resolved, By the State Board of Examiners,
that on Monday, November 9. 1896, It proceed
to examine and consider said claims by quar
ters, in order of presentation and by counties
in their alphabetical order; and that claim
ants need not go to the expense of appearing
before the Board of Examiners at said hear
ing, unless notified by publication or other
wise. Bfi&
More than three times as many claims
were presented during the last quarter as
during any other quarter. The number
ran from 3000 to 5000 scalps per quarter
until the last quarter, when it jumped to
over 17,000. There will be little investiga
tion of the early claim?, but those which
came in with such a rush will be closely
looked into. The majority of the sus
pected claims come from Kings, Fresno
and Alameda counties. In speaking of
the last quarter's claims Governor Budd
said:
"Of the entire $80,000 worth of claims, at
least $50,000 worth are fraudulent, and this
will necessitate the tracing out of every
ciass presented during that quarter, and
all persons who have presented fraudu
lent claims wili be prosecuted for per
jury."
It is claimed that the board has in its
possession overwhelming evidence that
thousands of prairie wolves' scalps were
snipped into the State and presented to
County Clerks as coyote scalps. This evi
dence is in the shape of the original boxes
in which scalps were shipped, together
with the shipping rece.pts. The board
will recommend that moneys be appropri
ated to pay all legitimate and doubtful
claims, the latter to be fully investigated
before any settlement is made.
SAN FRANCISCO ASSESSMENT.
State Equalisers T)ecidÂ« to Conduct an
Inquiry in lhiÂ» City.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Oct. 12.â The res
olution passed by the Merchants' Associa
tion of San Francisco condemning the
action taken by the equalizers in raising
San Francisco's assessment was read
before the equalizers to-day. It was re
solved to hold a meeting at San Francisco
at an early date and summon a number of
taxpayers before the board to inquire into
values, although sucn action was contested
by some of tne members on the ground
that it was now too late to do any good.

SACRAMENTO, Cal., Oct. 12â The Gov

MONTEREY'S CATHOLIC MISSION.
Paufist Fathers Institute a Religious Re
n'rtU in the Historic San Carlos
Church.
MONTEREY, Cal., Oct. 12.â The his
toric San Carlos Mission Church, built by
Indians in 1789 under ttie personal super
vision of Padre Junipero Serra, is at pres
ent the center of considerable interest in
Monterey. This old church s ands well
within the older Spanish portion of the
town, and while presenting outwardly the
nme appearance it did 100 ypars ago its
interior has been restored by deft hands,
so that now it is pretty and modern, with
out having the original ideas of the found
ers destroyed.
The Pauhst Fathers Arthur M. Clark
and Francis B. Doherty, from the Calilor
nia-street Roman Catholic Church of San
Francisco, at the 10 o'clock service yester
day morning opened a mission to religious
revival in the church, and they, toeetner
with Rev. Father R. M. Mestres. the pas
tor of San Carlos parish, have charee of it.
The object of this mission is to instruct
Roman Catholics in the doctrines and
observances of their church and to render
them more faithtul in their adherence.
Father Clark formally opened the mis
sion with a sermon on the object and aim
of the worn. His address was forceful
and to the point. In the evening, after
the Bhort instruction hour, Father
Doherty preached upon the subject,
â¢'Value of the Immortal Soul." The
principal point brought out by him was
the v timate destiny of the soul and the
relation religious training had to this
destiny.
The mission will continue through the
week, and there will be two daily ser
mons, or lectures, one at early mass and
the second in the evening, besides the
evening instruction hour. Heretofore .he
missions in Monterey have been conducted
in the Spanish language, because a major
ity of the local Catholics spoke that
language almost entirely. This is the first
in w ich English is used. The change
was made necessary by the increase of
Americans and English-speaking people
who have come into Monterey.

WOODLAND JAIL-BREAK.
Three Prisoners Cut Through a Prison
Lock by Means of a Pair of
Sheep-Shears.
WOODLAND, Cal., Oct. 12.â Three des
perate criminals^ â Joe Sprout, Fred Bray
and Frank Desmondâ who have served
time in most of the jails in Northern Cali
fornia, the former two having been in the

escaped from the County Jail to-day.
Sprout and Bray were sentenced this
morning by Judge Grant to five-year
terms in San Quentin for robbing freight
cars at Davisville. The two burglars, to
gether with Desmond, were taken from
their cells at the noon hour and allowed
their usual time in the corridor of the jail
for exercise. Tney effected their escnpe
oy the use of a pair of sheep-shears, which
they utilized as a chisel, cutting through
the fiimsy l<>ck in a short time. Sheriff

INQUEST AT SAN JOSE,
Coroner's Jury Unable to Fix
the Blame for the Palo
Alto Wreck.
Finds That Unknown Persons Threw
the Brakes of the Sidetracked
Cars.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Oct. 12.â An inquest
upon the remain* of Henry\Haggerty, the
engineer who was killed in t:.e railroad
collision at Palo Alto early Friday morn
ing, was held by Coroner Secord tc*day.
The testimony before the Coroner's jury
related principally to the cause of the col
lision.
The men upon train 31, which preceded
the train that was wrecked, testified
that they arrived at Palo Alto about 1:30
o'clock on the morning of the aocident
and detached one car for Palo Alto and
attached two which were waiting at that
place to be hauled to San Francisco. They
said there were five empty freight cars upon
the side track ai that time, and these they
left unmolested when they drew out from
the town about 1:40 o'clock. Thes â  five
cars, after the departure of train 31,
through some unknown cause ran down
the grade of the side track across the
spring switch to the mam track and col
lided with the train which was wrecked at
about 2 o'clock. No one saw the cars
moving or knew the main track was
blocked until the cra-h came.
Coroner Becord endeavored to ascertain
from the men on train No. 31 it they
| struck the empty cars w*ien switching
upon the sidetrack, probably starting
them to move. The train men firmly
maintained that they did not toucn the
empty cars.
The jury was unable to fix the blame for
the accident upon any person and ren
dered a verdict that Engineer Haggerty
came to his death as the result of a rail
road collision, due to the carelessness of
unknown parties in r> moving the brake
from cars ieft upon a portion of the rail
road track.

Events.
LOS ANGELEB, Cal., Oct. 12.âThe
races of the Sixth District Agricultural
Association were begun to-day and will
continue for the balance of the week.
Tuere was a small crowd present, but
some good contests were witnessed. Favor
ites captured two out of the four events,
the second choices winning the others.
Betting was quite spirited and the books
were hit several hard licks on ti.e heats of
both the trottina; and pacing events.
First on the card was the Los Angeles
Derby, a sweepstakes for three-year-olds,
at a mile. Grady opened as favorite at 1
to 2. The start was a poor one, the gate
being used. Don Pio Pico made the run
ning, Grady being kept well up until the
stretch, when he forged ahead and won
easily 'by two lengths. Rebellion, 2to 1,
got second place and Don Pio Pico, 10 to 1,
third. Prince Hooker, Emma R and
Alessandro also ran.
In the maiden plate, six furlongs for
two-year-oids, seven horses started. Cor
dova at 3 to JL cut the pace at the latter
part of the race and led into the stretch,
winning by a length and a half. Sharon
Lass, at 6 to 1, was second, and Valdos,
Bto 1, third. The other starters were El
Venado, the favorite, Billy Bryan, Clatawa
and Minta Owen.
The 2:20-ciass pace for a purse of $800
proved a walk-over for C. A. Durfee's

sequence Mamie Griffin was made a short
odds favorite, 1 to 2 being the be t laid
against her. The talent was thrown down,
however, for the mare made a poor show
ing because of a bad leg. the best her
driver could do being to secure third place.
Jasper Ayers, a 5 to 1 shot, proved the

SAN DIEGO, Cal., â¢ Oct. 12.â The
largest crowd ihnt ever gathered on the
plaza greeted Hon. William J. Hunsaker
of Los Angeles to-night. j; J: \ \ , â¢
; Mr. : : Hunsaker was formerly Mayor of
San* Diego, and ; he ;is : to-day one of the
most prominent Democrats in Southern
Ca if ornia. 'â ;â¢ What i he i bÂ«d >; to â¢' Â»ay. there

"L?t ;us, look at ; this . thine,"., he said, 1
'and \ see whether I ; have >i left the D mo
cratic \ party or whether the \ Democratic
party. has let its traditions of a century." ;
PHe then read I the D-mocratic platform
of 1892. which declared that it was opposed
totue free coinage of silver without inter
national agreement.'fgpgip^jgg^lg?- :- ./
- ' "That," said the. speaker, "is where the
Republican party stands to-day."/.
Then he read the Populist platform of
1892, and it wns clearly shown to be the
parent of the Democratic i>latform of 1896.
Mr. Uunsaker was vigorously applauded
for his masterly arraignment of his party
for its i osition relating to the Supreme
Court, the uÂ«e of Federal troops and other
questions.
"It U no imneachment of my Dem
ocracy," said Mr. Hunoaker, "that I
choose rather to follow the leadership of a
pure man, a statesman, a brave soldier,
than Bryan and hi< compatriotsâ Pitch
fork Ti.lman and Marion Butler. In 1S&1
I should have voted for Lincoln, because
it meant, the lile of the country.
"In 1896 I shall vo c lor McKinley, be
cause it means the integrity of the coun
try, and one should be as dear as the
other. When I received a teleeram
statins that I had been " ar>
pointed a Presidential elector on the
Palmer-Buckner ticket," continued Mr.
Hunsaker, "I imme liately sent back the
reply that I appreciated the honor, but I
believed it was the duty of every true
Democrat, every patri otic lover of his
country to vote for William McKinley."
Mr. Hunsaker's entire speech was full of
knockdown truths from a man who is
known to be fearless.
SHOTB BY WRONGED HUSBAND.
Cwynn R. Tompkins Seriously Wounded
by John W. Collins at Wash
ington.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Oct 12.-Gwynn
R. Tompkins of Washington, whose di
vorced wife, Elizabeth A. Tompkins, lives
in San Francisco and is known as "Helen
Dare," was shot and seriously wounded
this afternoon by John W. Collins.
The latter alleged that Tompkins had
been intimate with his wife. Collins is a
young man, who had been employed in
the District of Columbia building for over
three years. He was married eight years
ago to Mina Sparklin.
Several years ago the wife left her hus
band without any cause whatever, so the
latter says, and she had some acquain
tance with Tompkins. Since last Septem
ber Collins and his wlfo have been living
together. He had no suspicion of his
wife's infidelity until a few days ago,
wiien he found a note in her room from
Torupkins asking ncr to meet him at "the
same old place."
THE SUISUN MYSTERY,
O.ficials Seeking Farmer Wil
son's Slayer Still Work
in the Dark.
SUISUN, Cal., Oct. 12.â Tn- excite
ment caused by the murder of Daniel H.
Wilson, in Suisun Valley last Friday,
grows more intense. When the Coroner's
jury met at the Courthouse to-day the
room was crowded to the doors. Deputy
Coroner Maynard opened the proceedings
by calling Mn. Lucy Owens, the house
keeper who was at Wilson's residence
wheii the murder occurred, to the s:and.
The witness kept remarkably cool, and
told practically the same story as that
given out on theday following the tragedy.
The cro-<s-examination by District Attor
ney Devlin brought out further facts.
Mrs. Owens said her time as house
keeper for Wilson was to have expired
last Sunaar, and a former housekeeper,
Birdie O'Brien, was to have taken her
place.
Wilson told her that If Mras O'Brien
came back and stayed with him he would
die i her the home place. He said the
witness could stay at his house until she
found something to do.
Mrs. Owens said Wilson had contem
plated marrying a Mi*s Alice Knowles of
San Francisco, but the enga ement fell
through owing to the lady's indisposition
and deiicate state of health.
Mrs. Addie Wilson, who was legally
separated trom Wilson about, three years
ago, denied having any bitter feelings
toward her husband, and stated that she
never discusse 1 the question of the dis
tribution o his estate among the chil
dren after his death.
The inquest was then continued to
Tuesday morning.
In compliance with Sheriff Rush's re
quest Governor Budd has offered a reward
of $600 for such information as will lead to
the arrest and conviction of the assassin.
WiNon's son has not yet returned.
The remains of the murdered mau were
to-day in erred in F;iirfield Cemetery, the
services being held under the auspices of
the G. A. K.

NEW TO-DAT
Fall Suits.
The Suits we offer this Fall are better
than usualâ s2s and $30 kinds â or rather
the kind that men get when they pay that
for a suit at their tailors.
We will not sell them at that price â
because it's too high.
Our price is $9, $10, $12.50, $15 and
$18. The best for $18.
Some of these suits are from cloths by
Martin, Sykes, Clay, Laverton and Ballen-
tine. These are the best English makers.
Others are of cloth of American manu-
facture, which is now in some cases better
than the English.
This store has always sold a big lot of
overcoats every Fall. This Fall we're going
to sell just as many suits as overcoats. The
suits we are offering are especially attrac-
tive as to style, value and price. That's
the plan â that's the way.
Every suit will be perfectly satisfactory
to every purchaser. If not, he must bring
it back. We'll refund or exchange, as de-
desired.

PREPARING FOR IHYASION.
Thousands of Hunters Expected at
the Seat of Trouble on
Thursday.
BUIBUN, Cal., Oct. 12.â 8100 d may flow
on the Suisun marshes when the duck
hunting season opens on Thursday. Sports
men from far and near will gather to test
the power of the Cordelia and Teal cluos
to keep the hunters of Solano County off
the land leased by these two bands of rich
men.
It is expected that several thousand
men will be on the marshes, gun in hand,
and it is altogether improbable that this
force will allow spike bill or canvas
back to rest in security within the pre
scribed limits.
The Teal and Cordelia ciubs are going
to considerable expense In barricading the
sloughs, and they will have a large num
ber of gamekeepers on hand to keep out
outsiders. With public feeling at its pres
ent Ditch, a blow or a shot from one of
these guardsmen of the preserves would
be the signal for a battle.
vVord had been passed from mouth to
mouth, and as if by common impulse
every sportsman within a radius of many
miles will journey forth to the
marshes. When they arrive they will
find all of the best hunting ground
fenced in, while within the inclosure
a party of hunters, the most of whom hail
from San Francisco, will be banging
away at the name fowls attracted to their
baited ponds. What the army oi out
siders will do under these circumstances
will be recorded in Thursday night's dis
patches.
The petitions recently circulated asking
the Solano Connty Supervisors to close
the shooting season within two weeks
after it is opened as one means of defent
ing the Oun Ciubs' monopoly is meeting
with some opposition, although signed by
hundreds of sportsmen in Vallejo, Benicia
and Sui-un.
Those who oppose this move do so be
cause they believe they can prove in court
that the privileged clubs are obstructing
navigation, and thus compel them to re
move the barriers tbÂ«y have erected. If
notâ well, there are whispered rumors
which augur ill for the barriers and those
who would defend t em.
Alpine J iiver n in Ifnnner.
PABADENA, Cal.. Oct. 8. â Notwith
standing that tire-liirhters have all re
turned from the Sierra Madre, reporting
the first fire extinguished, a conflagration
is now raging on the front range, within
a milo nnd a half of the Alpine Tavern
and the Mount Lowe Railway, and work
ing toward Mount Lowe property. It is in
Saucer Can yon, a branch ot Hiilards
Canyon, and close to where ten men
fougnt the tire two days ago. They re
turned on Saturday, reporting the fire
extinguished. Twenty-five men returned
from tn<* other side.
At 11 a. m. fourteen were sent out tofl?ht
this new outbreak. Unless they check it
before it reaches the main canyon it is
likely to destroy the Alpine Tavern and
the bridges on the Mount Low* Railway,
thnii'.-h the Echo Mountain Hotel would
probably be all right, because of a con
siderable cleared space around it.

OPERA-HOUSE
Success of Hartman's Ex
travaganza at the
Tivoli.
The Comedian's Work Contains
Bright Music and New
Jokes.
AN OLD PLAY AT THE GRAND
Beatrice Lieb and Her Lily Langtry
Fall at the Alcazar Last
Evening.
Ferris Hartman's friends packed the
Tivoli Opera-house last night to welcome
him in his new capacity as a composer of
musical extravaganza, and flowers, ap
plause and encores were rained upon the
fortunate comedian with reckless pro
fusion.
"The Babe 3in the Wood" is Hartman's
first attempt in the line of composition,
and in the inevitable speech for wiiich he
was called he described it as a "very silly,
siilv little thing." Indeed, he has never
spoken of it save with apologies for its
shortcomings, which shows the wisdom of
not unduly raising people's hopes before
hand, for "The Babes in the Wood" scored
an emphatic success last night.
The new musical comedy is almost
innocent of plot, but that is a peculiarity
of most works of its kind, and on the
other hand the music is bright, sparkling
and almost ail new to San Francisco
hearers; the "turns" of which the comedy
largely consists are clever and diversified,
the jokes are new and up to date, and the
management has contributed its share
toward the success of "The Baoes in the
Wood" by providing a good company and
pretty and approprate costumes.
It is sai I taut the music consists chiefly
of new songs irom New York and London.
If so, a number of very attractive songs
must be in vogue now, and it is no exag
geration to say that Hartman has shown
great taste and skill in adapting them to
his own purposes. Among the most ap
plauded pieces were the pretty duet,
"1 Wonder Why"; the song and chorus,
"Ha, Ha." which Kaffael sings wilh
his lollowers as Sir Rowland Macassar;
the graceful ballad "In Dreamland," sung
by Khys Thonias; the song which Mau
rice Darcy sang so well, "Sne Has No
Popper Now"; the "Spider and Fly"
duet between the babes, and â but to
enumerate the pretty melodies would be
to name them nearly ail.
As to the joKes, most of them- were
either political or local. Here are a few
oi them: Says Weary Willie â 16 to 1 is
not haif so good as 12 to 1. Dusty Rhodes
âHow's that? Weary Willieâ l2 to 1â
free lunch.
Two conspirators are ta'.king, and Dr.
Deadstone asks of Lady Macassar, "Has
all been kept secret?" "Yed," replies
Ludy Macassar; "we advertised che fact
in all the Oakland papers, so now no one
can hear about it."
Ferris Hartmaa played the part of
Weary Willie, and W. H. West was
Trusty Rhodes, his companion in abduct
ing tue babes. The two worthies quarrel
in the forest, as their predecessors in the
fairy tale did, but, unlike those gentle
men, they fight it out in a burlesque prize
tight, which was one of the moat amusing
turns in the extravaganza. Miss Lilly
Post, the pnma donna, who made
her reappearance last night, was
in good voice, and sang sweetly as
Miss C. Raven, the fascinating school
teacher. Elvira Crox Seabrooke threw her
self with plenty of spirit into the role of
the female babe, ami Maurice Darcy sang
and acted cleveriy as her brotner. Miss
Bernice Hclmes was good as the "new
woman,'' and her band of bicycle girls
won a good deal of applause in the cos
tumes of local clubs. John J. Raffael and
William H. Tookeralso did good work.
Last night a number of encores were de
manded and given, and, as the second act
was long in itself, the clocks had just
struck 10:30 before the curtain went down
on the second act, and it was well toward
midnight before the audience reached
their homes. It is stated that to-night the
extravaganza will be pruned down, so that
people can be sent on their wav rejoicing
by 10:30.
The Baldwin.
The drawing qualities of the "Prisoner of
Zenda" were illustrated by the presence of an
unusually large audience on the opening of
the second week of the production. The de
cree of the management in regard to high
headgear was widely observed by the fair con
stituency of the Baldwin.
The large audience manifested the deepest
interest in the romantic story of Anthony
Hope's creation, and expressed the admira
tion lor excellence in three times recalling
Mr. Hackett and Isabel Irving. The "Prisoner
of ' Zenda" holds position at the Baldwin
throughout the week.
Grand Opera-House.
"Uncle Tom's Cabin" was revived at the
Graud Opera-house last night, with L. R.
Stock well in his famous part of Marks, the
lawyer. The performance was greeted by an
immense audience, which enjoyed the funny
side oi the play more than the sentimental,
except where Eva was in the scene.
Frank Hatch as Phineas Fletcher, the
Quuker, elicited a round of applause every
ume he stood on his toes and said, "Yea,
verily." Harry Benrimo as George Harris, tue
runaway slave, looked the tine, handsome
mulatto to perfection, but he was too haudy
with bia pistol lor a man wishing to escape
observation. Miss Julia Blanc bad a congenial
part in Mist Ophelia, and Miss Williams played
the part of Topsy in a spirited and clever
manner.
The star of the evening was little Mildred, as
Eva, She looked quite ethereal, and her sweet
little sympathetic voice was very touching.
Many people were observed surreptitiously
wiping their eyes in the scene with her
father and at the death scene.
At the Alcazar.
Beatrice Lieb, in "The Wife's Peril" last
evening at the Alcazar, gave the audience the
Langtry fall and roll off the sofa to perfection.
Theater-goers will remember how the Jersey
Lily took her emotional tumble in this play
when she first bloomed to the public on tnis
side of the pondâ a swoon, a drop on to the
sofa, then down to the carpet. "The Wife's
Peril" is one of the best pieces given by the
Alcazar Company, and John T. Sullivan as Mr.
Wiuthrop and J. B. Polk as Dr. Blair were ex
ceptionally good in their roles.
There was, however, too. much of Francis
Powers' suffering, so much of it that he made
one wonder why he did not take to his bed at
once. Carl Smith, as Major Doolittle, and
Mrs. Bates, as Mrs. Prendergast, were perfect
"friends," and did much toward making
their host wretched. There was hardly
enough of Fry Clayton, as Theodore Doolittle,
and pretty May Buckley, as Amy Winthrop.
The piece will be piayed all this week.
At the Orphenm.
Several new turns are given at the Orpheum
this week, and hold-overs appear, for the most
part, in new acts. The two Lucifers do some
clever athletic work, which they diversify
with comic dialogue. The male Lucifer has
an almost Sandow development of muscle, and
throws a stalwart young stage hand about as
if he were a plaything. He also accomplishes
some remarkably high kicking.
| {Ando, Omne and Alright are a trio of ac
complished Japanese jugglers, who were here
some two years ago. Little Alright's contor
tions have evidently agreed with him, for the
child who wag puay-lookiug at that lime has
developed in bone and muscle. Omne does
some clever juggling with the flags of all na
tions, and Ando does excellent balancing
tricks. The Hengler sisters, direct from the
Aihambra, London, scarcely lived last nigut
up to the European reputation which pre
ceded them. They are two rather pretty but
excessively thin young women, who dress
strikingly," kick high and chirp duets in twit
tering voices-, like little sparrows.
Pitrot has added b number oi local celebri
ties to his delineations. He is also givii'K >nn
txtions of noted composers. Muster Walter
Leon is appearing in new mimicries, and
Gertie Cochran, the memory child, has added
some new statistics to her already large store
of knowledge. Unthan, the carpo brothers
and Riley and Hughes repeat their pertorm
ances of last week, and the Hawaiian band
continues to please the hearers with selec
tions, though they are seldom those placed on
the programme.
Columbia Theater.
"Trilby" continues to fill the Columbia
Theater. There was scarcely a vacant seat in
tho house last night and the play was greeted
with more applause than on the opening
night
Hinrichs-Beel Concert.
The first Hinrichs-Beel concert will take
place at the Baldwin Theater on Friday after
noon next. __________^__

as follows:
From 9:30 until 10:30 o'clock all votes
cast will be entered upon the blackboard
placed on the front of the platform, full

An excursion party, consisting of 300

Fresno Business Men's Club. The excur
sionists v/ill come through to San Fran

on a steamer from Stockton.
California fruit-shippers who have cus
tomers in Seattle, Tacoma or other points
in the State of Washington must now take
special care to against tbe consign
ment of wormy fruit to that region.
Tbe following circular from the freight
department of the Southern Pacific Com
pany will be issued to-day:
FRUIT QUARANTINE IN WASHINGTON.
To Agtnts : The tltate Board of Horticulture
of the State ot Washington has announced
that it will quarantine against all fruit when
invested with worms.
If upon inspection by the agent or repre
sentative of the State Board ol Horticulture
the iruit is found to be wormy it will be de
stroyed or returned to shipper at shipper's ex
pense.
On shipment of fruit consigned to Washing
ton charges must be fully prepaid or guaran
teed from point of shipment to destination.
At same time full explanation ot the above
should be read to shipper. c. F. Smurr,
General Freight Agent.
It is not obvious that the State authori
ties of Washington are aiming at Calitor
nia shippers. It may be that wormy fruit
from Oregon has caused the action of the
State Board of Horticulture.
The shipments this season of deciduous
fruits from this State to points east of the
Rocky Mountains show a faljing off in
quantity as compared with last year's
traffic. Up to September 30, 1895, the
quantity sent East amounted to 4086 car-
Joads. The shipments up to September 30
of this year were 3627 carloads. Each car
contains twelve tons, and the failing off,
therefore, amounts to 5446 tons. The cost
of transportation was not increased, but
in some respects slightly diminished.
The inquiry into the causes of the recent
smash-up on the rail near May field has
not been finished, but is still in progress.

THE FORESTERS' CHIEF.
Dr. Oronhyatekha of the Inde
pendent Order in This
City.
Tend; red a Reception by Court San
Franciscoâ H gh Conrt of Caiifor
n a to Meet in Sin Jose.
Dr. Oronnyatekha, supreme chief ranger,
or head of the Independent Order of For
esters, arrived at the Occidental Hotel
yesterday afternoon from his borne in To
ronto, Canada. He has come here to at
tend an important meeting of the order
to be held to-day and to-morrow in San
Jose.
Oronhyatekha, for he has but that one
name, is a full-blooded Indian, a man of
great size, of striking, intellectual appear
ance ana commanding and pleasing pres
ence. Considerably over six feet in height
and of powerful physique he weighs 240
pounds.
In addition to holding the highest office
among the Foresters, he is a thirty-third
degree Royal Arch Aason. is Most Wor
shipful Grand Master Mason of the
Dominion of Royal and Oriental Masonry,
for thirty-nine years has been a member
of that body known as Good Templars,
and a few years ago at a session of its
supreme lodge, held at Edinburgh, Scot
land, he was elected to the highett office
belonging to the organization.
He was born at the Six Nations Reserva
tion, near Brantford, Ontario, in 184 L His
education was begun at home in the in
dustrial school established for the training
of younc Indians. Later he entered Wes
leyan Arademy at Wilbraham, Mass., and
attended daring several school terms be
lore goins: to Kenyon College, Ohio. There
he remained two years. Tben he spent
one year in Toronto University. All this
time he bad been earning his own way.
Wliile lie was a student at Kenyon Col
leee the Prince of Wales made his mem
orable visit to Canada. The chiefs of the
six nations deputized young Oronhyatekba
to deliver their address to the son of the
"Great Mother," as they called Queen Vic
toria. So favorable was the impression
maiie upon the Prince and his party by
that speech and by its graceful delivery
ttiat Oronhyatekha was invited to con
tinue ins studies at Oxford University in
England under the care of Sir Henry
Acland, regius professor of medicine.
He went to England and subsequently
received the degree of doctor oi medicine.
Returning to Canada he began the prac
tice of medicine in London, Ontario, and
met with marked success. He gave up his
profession, however, to devote bis wholÂ«
energies to the Independent Order of
Foresters, which, under his management,
has been brought up from a member
ship of a few hundred to almost 100,000.
The High Court will convene in San
Jose this forenoon for its twenty-third
session.
Tnis order differs from the Ancient or
American order in so far as it is known as
the "insurance order," with one supreme
court, wiiich m located at Toronto, Canada,
thirty-two high courts and 2600 subordi
uate courts and a membership of 98,000
scattered over the United States aud
Great Britain.
From tiie report of the supreme secre
tary it appears that the order nas a sur
plus of $1,848,000 on hand, notwithstand
ing ttiai $3,800,000 has been paid out in
benefits.
The order in California is under the
jurisdiction of G. A. McEUresh, tue State
hign chief ranger, who will preside at ses
sions of this convention. He will be as
sisted by Charles S. Peery, the high coun
selor ot tue order, for this State with
other High Court officers.
Since the organization of the order in
New York in 1874 the officers and mem
bers claim that the Independent Foresters
have kept pace with any similar beneficial
order in the Uniied States.
Tne session at San Jose wili continue
for the next two days at the Yendome
Hotel.
POPULISTS WILL RATIFY.
The Meeting: Scheduled for To-Morrow
Night at the Populist Tent.
A thousand invitations to tbe ratifica
tion meeting of the municipal ticket of the
Populists were struck off yesterday and
will be scattered broadcast over tbe City
to-day. The meeting will be held to
morrow evening at the People's party
tent, corner of Market and Larkin streets,
and at Scottish Hall, 105 Larkin street.
Buckley, it seems, has not been con
sulted in the matter of ratification, for
Buckley is not in quite so much favor as
he was during tbe late municipal conven
tion. He is accused of breaking some of
his agreements, rud ere long it is expected
that the wily Christopher will be in con
siderable disfavor.

HEW TO- DAT.
Saw the l'oi-it Finally.
A man said: "When I was s young
chap I could use coffee and tobacco with-
out their troubling me, but as I get along
in years they both distress me. I quit
tobacco, but only got a little better; liver,
stomach and bowels kepi all out of gear,
until finally my old doctor told me that
coffee had the same poisonous alkaloids as
tobacco, but not quite so many, and ad-
vised me to leave it off and give nature a
chance to build up. I didn't take much
stock in the old man's advice, but found
out by trying it that he was just right.
Still I missed my hot drink at breakfast
and supper â tried chocolate, but that
lacks the taste I like, and tea don't go ex-
actly to the spot. Lately I have bee.i
drinking Postum Cereal Coffee and like it
better than the oli coffee. It has that
pungent taste that fits my notion of a hot
drink, and it agrees with me well enough
that I have put on ten pounds in a month.
It is made of grains wholly and brews a
deep rich color, like the finest Mocha.
Wife buys it at the grocery and says it
cos a us about one-third what coffee used
to." It comes from Battle Creek. Mich.

* OK FKESIDENT-
WILLIAM McKINLEY, or Ohio
rOK VICF-PRESIDENTâ
GARRET A. HOBART, of New Jersey
Election November 3, J896.
Cator may not be an issue, but he thinks
he is.
Republicans can be confident of victory
provided they base their confidence on
unity of effort.
McKinley stands for protection and so
do the people; he is the leader and they
will support him.
Bryar. may dodge the tariff issue in this
campaign, but he cannot dodge bis record
on the Wilson bill.
What does it profit the Democracy to
put ud a game on the Populists and then
let Cator hold the stakes?
The home market is the best market for
the farmer so long as he has sense enough
to protect it from foreign competition.
The old Democratic warhoraes may have
sore heads, but there is nothing the mat
ter with the kicking power of the feet of
them.
Don't forget that Republican harmony
depends largely on yourself. Get into
line and set the wranglers a good ex
ample.
It is the duty of every citizen to do
something for good government. It i<*
his duty to work for the election of Colonel
Taylor. _____
If .Buckley and Rainey can succeed in
dividing the Republican party the revenue
of San Francisco will be the spoil of the
winner.
The Populists will never know what
Buckley did to them in their convention
until after the votes are counted on elec
tion day.
How can any man say protection to
American industry is not an issue when
there are so many unemploysd men in the
country?
It is hard for the Democratic spell-binders
to keep silent, but most of them are doing
it. Bryanism has proven to be a very
effective gag.
Bimetallism is a much broader platform
â¦ ban silver monometallism and, accord
ingly, the majority of the American peo
ple are standing on it.
The fact that the Democracy has not
even a. candidate for the Senate may be
taken as conclusive evidence the party is
suffering from collapsus kernluncus.
As the silver* wave subsides the tide of
genuine bimetallism rises and helps to
swell the Repubiican flood that will bear
the country on to & permanent prosperity.
The shadow of Buckley and Rainey is on
both the Phelan and the Dimond ticket,
and if either of them should be elected
that double shadow would be on the
whole city.
Why should America import sugar?
Why not produce it at home? Why not
build up the Industry in California? You
will have to answer these questions when
yon vote on election day.
A taiiff on foreign imports yielding
enough revenue to pay the expenses of the
Government will maintain the gold re
serve and go a long way toward settling
the whole money question.
Archbishop Ireland has joined the
goodly company of the wise who warn the
people against the dangers of Bryanism.
The boy orator is a firebrand the Ameri
can people must extinguish at once.
The campaign will soon be over, next
we'll see the end of Grover and then we
will safely live in cloverâ not the free
trade kind that grows but thinly, but a
good, rich crop under Bill McKinley.
ftom the drift of the municipal cam
paign it seems clear the Phelan move
ment was started to draw votes from the
Republican ticket in order to enable the
bosses to restore the Buckley regime to
power.
One of the notable features of the cam
paign in California haa been the effective
work done by the Republican League
clubs. They have made the canvass for
good business in a businesslike way, and
will have a large part of the glory of the
coming victory.
A Democratic contemporary declares
"the Bryan Republicans of Alameda
County are to be organized in a club by
themselves." They ought to be. If there
be such things as "Bryan Republicans"
they should be sequestered and quaran
tined. After the Alameda managers have
completed their menagerie of "Bryan Re
publicans" they will probably attempt to
add to their show an aviary of white
blackbirds.
ARCHEISHOP IRELAND'S. AD
DRESS.
The solemn and weighty words of warn
j ing against the dangers of what in the
language of the day may be called "Bry
anism" which Archbishop Ireland has
addressed to the people of the United
States hardly need comment to impress
their truth upon reflecting minds. The
words of the venerable ArchbisbOD are so
clear, so strong, and all his sentences are
so infused with the living light of wise
patriotism that they shine with such
luminous power that he who runs may
read.
The Archbishop says :
America heretofore has been free from so
cialistic hatred and warfare; it has been a 1
country of opportunities for all men, and it
has given to the laborer a livelihood higher
and better tnan is afforded him in any other
country in the world. Is this all to be changed?
Is social chaos, gloating over ruins, to be a
method of the social elevation of the masses?
There may be room in some things lor peace- |
ful amelioration through well-informed pub- j
lie opinion and orderly legislation, but class
hatred end angry passion never led' to any
i thing but general misery and suffering.
The truth of these words is not affected
by the fact ibat many sincere and honest
minded citizens are not aware of the ten
dency involved in the Bryanite campaign.
As the Archbishop himself says: "Many
adherents of the movement do not per
ceive its full meaning, but let them be
ware. They will light torches which,
borne in the hands of reckless men, may
light up in this country the lurid fires of a
commune."
America has been free from the class
hatreds and strifes which have so dis
turbed the governments and peoples of
Europe. So abundant are the opportuni
ties for industry to advance itself in this
country that it has been very justly as
well as very strikingly said, "America is
opportunity." By tne exercise of their
energies and their talents, the young men
of America have been able to secure
themselves all the comforts of a happy
life, and where gifted with more than J
| ordinary talent have been easily enabled
by industry to advance themselves to the
highest offices in the State. From the
beginning of our history it has been so,
and it is so to-day. At this very moment
neither of the men who is aspiring to the
Presidency with the support of his fellow
citizens was born to wealth or to any
artificial advantages. Thane opportunities
may be destroyed by rashness and reck
lessness, and it is certainty the duty of
every citizen to guard, protect and defend
them wherever they are threatened by the
discontented, envious and malignant.
The words of the Archbishop on the
subject of free coinage of silver are hardly
less weighty than those on the subject of
anarchy and defiance of law. As he points
out, the issue involved in the free coinage
of silver as advocated by the Bryanites is
really an issue of morality, rather than of
finance. In genuine bimetallism there
would be a benefit to tne country and the
preservation of National honor, individual
i integrity and justice to all; but the Bryan
policy threatens every creditor and en
dangers every trade and every industry.
The words of Archbishop Ireland are none
too strong in characterizing the folly of
this movement. Dangerous in itself, it is
made doubly so by the character of the
men who advocate it and the nature ol
their harangues to the people in support
of it.
If there is a State in the Union that has
been peculiarly blessed by the adoption
and maintenance of that policy of which
William McKinley is the chosen chain- j
pion, that State ia California, and I have
not met within your borders a man,
woman or child or an Indian not taxed
who has pretended for one moment that
j the striking down of that policy to the
extent to which it was stricken down by
the Wilson bill haÂ« not injured every
industry within your border*. So to me
it is unaccountable that it should be
necessary to add any testimony. Every
field, every orchard, every vineyard,
every pasture, every herd and every
flock constantly, daily, weekly, month
i lv, perennially, declares to this people
I that the striking down of the protec
tive tariff was unwise for California.â

M'KINLEY AND THE TARIFF.
Among the notable contributions to the
tariff controversy, and one which is cer
tain to outlive the campaign tffld become
a permanent part of our political litera
ture, is the treatise by William McKinley
on "The Tariff in the Days of Henry Clay
and Since." It has just been published,
and reviews our tariff legislation down to
the time of the last bond issue of the
Cleveland administration.
Mr. McKinley states that in writing the
book it has been his aim, as completely as
possible, to review all tariff legislation
since the close of the Civil War to the
present time end to give a summary of
all proposed legislation on the subject, the
object being to enable the student to
easily acquaint himself with the trend of
political parties and the aims and intents
of political leaders in this respect.
In order that the subject may fully be
understood Mr. McKinley has not hesi
tated to introduce subjects which, at first
sight, appear foreign to the tariff, but
which, as he goes on to show, must be
understood by the student in order that
he may have a more adequate comprehen
sion of the tariff legislation proposed by
the political parties of the country.
It is hardly necessary to say that this
work demonstrates in a masterly manner
the importance of the tariff issue to the
welfare and prosperity of the American
people. That much goes without saying,
since Mr. McKinley is well Known as the
ablest master of the Mibjoct now living,
and his ability to treat it cannot be ques
tion. He has not written, however, as a
partisan. He apDeara in this treatise
rather as a historian than a political
leader. The book is a just, fair and im
partial summary of the tariff legislation
of the country, and as such can be read
and studied with profit by all who wish to
make themselves familiar with the sub
ject.
After giving an account of the sales of
bonds by the Cleveland administration,
and pointing out that they were cansed in
a large measure by the deficiency in the
revenue, Mr. McKinley deals at some
length with the last bond sale, which is
generally known aa the popular loan, and
which drew the money directly from the
people instead of by a losing bargain with
a financial syndicate. Of this Mr. McKin-
Uy very justly says: "The sale proves
conclusively that the financial strength
and stability of the United States Govern
ment is without parallel throughout the
world. It also demonstrates that the peo
ple are not deceived by deficiencies m the
revenue to meet the expenditures of the
Government. Granted a competent tariff

tion the accuracy of the conclusions. A
tariff is assuredly necessary for the wel
fare of the American people, and as Mr.
McKinlev says: "Ascertaining the truth,
and dismissing from our minds all preju
dice or preconceived opinions, let us have
the wisdom and courage to be guided by
it."
I do not believe there are many men in
this country, no matter what they have
thought in the past, who will not now
say that free trade or so-called tariff re
form has proven by the experience of
the past four years to be a signal and
disastrous failure. It has failed, utterly
failed, in every prophecy, promise Â»nd
expectation, it haa not secured a single
thing that its advocates said would fol

not served a single American interest.
It has served the interest of other na

benefit to the American people.â McKin-
REAL BIMETALLISM.
The attempt of the Examiner on Sunday
to show an inconsistency between the
present position of General Butterworth,
as a supporter of McKinley, and his well
known championship of bimetallism is
but another illustration of the desire
of the free silverites to confuse the real
issue before the people. The Bryanites
would have the people believe that
the choice is between the free coinage
of silver and the single gold stan
dard. They seek by every means in
their power to divert attention from the
fact that the Republican party has never
declared for tne single gold standard, but
has been always and is now firm in its
support of genuine bimetallism.
The Republican platform declares: "We
are opposed to the, free coinage of silver,
except by international agreement with
the leading commercial nations of the
world, which we pledge ourselves to pro
mote." It is on this platform that Major
I McKinley seeks the suffrages of the people,
and it is on this that General Butterworth
and all other true friends of bimetallism
support him and urge his election by the
people.
The platform of the Republican party is
in strict accord with the established law of
the land. The act of Congress of Novem
ber, 1893, say 3:
And It is hereby declared to be the policy of
the United States to continue the use of both
gold and silver as standard money, and coin
both gold and silver into money of equal in
trinsic and exchangeable value, suc%.equality
to be secured through international agree
| ment, or by such safe course of legislation as
will insure the maintenance of the parity in
value of the coins of the two metals, and the
equal power of every dollar at all times in the
markets aud in the payment of debts; and it is
hereby further declared that the efforts of the
Government should be steadily directed to the
establishment of a safe system of bimetallism
that will maintain at all times the equal power
of every dollar coined or issued by the United
Slates in the markets and in the payment of
debts.
That is not a plank of a party platform,
it is a law of the United States. The Re
publican party is pledged to the mainte
nance of that law. It does not favor a
depreciated currency. It does not favor
silver monometallism. It does favor and
pledge the incoming administration to
maintain the largest use of silver possi
ble at a parity with gold. Under such a
policy, both silver and gold will circulate
concurrently among the people. The
money used in wages paid to the working
man will have a purchasing povrer equal
to the money used in settling the balances
between the wealthiest bankers and the
country. Any other system would be a
fraud upon labor, aud more disastrous
even than free trade.
The Republican party, ever the true
champion of American labor, will neither
advocate nor accept any currency save that
which the law of the United States guar
antees, and which, under Republican ad
ministrations, has never failed to be ade
quate to the needs of the Government and
the prosperity of the people.
With the passage of free coinage we
shall have a currency rejected at its
nominal value in the commercial mar
kets of the world, unstable and fluctu
ating in real value. Business cannot
prosper with such a currency. The
first condition of life of business Is sta
bility of currency. No one will invest
money of a certain value to-day in
commerce and industry if by the time
the raw material has been turned into
marketable wurei the currency is likely
to have changed in value.â Archbishop
Ireland.
FUSION WILL NOT AVAIL.
Populistic politicians appear to be laugh
ing in tbeir sleeves over the humiliating
predicament in which they have cast the
Democratic party of California. They have
cause for merriment, since it turna out
that they are in supreme control of the
Democratic organization through the
State.
The fact is clearly demonstrated in the
nominations for the State Legislature out
side of San Francisco, and in all other im
portant nominations it is acknowledged
that the Populists had to be consulted be
fore the ticket could be made up.
That the Democrats feel this grievous
invasion of their autonomy, which they
regard as a virtual capture and monopo
lization of their party organization,
may be readily understood. When
ever two independent Democrats may
be heard comparing opinions, curses
deep and loud are directed against
the cunningly devised fusion schemes
engineered by Hon. Thomas V. Cator
and the Bimetallic League, and suc
cessfully carried through only because the
members who constitute the bone and
sinew of the Democratic party have allowed
themselves to be hoodwinked by political
tricksters.
It is south of Tehachapi that the Popu
lists appear to have obtained their most
powerful foothold; and if Senator Stephen
M. White has not winked at the inroads
upon his party organization in a section
that is considered to be under bis protec
torate, then it must be acknowledged that
he is no longer the astute political man
ager that his admirers consider him. The
crumbs of comfort thrown to Mr. White
by the Populists are too insignificant for
serious consideration. Of all the hold
over Democratic Senatorial nominees con
ceded in the southern part of the State to
Mr. White for possible use two years from
now only one has a righting opportunity
for success. In Republican Assembly dis
tricts in Los Angeles the Populists gener
ously withdrew in favor of the Democrats,
and then "fused" op the remainder of the
ticket with their own men where they
thought they had a ghost of a chance
to win out.
Democrats of the old school, who feel
the indignity and the insult that has been
cast upon them, are not inclin ed to speak
their minds fully, and if they did some of
their remarks might not be relished by
ears polite. The general consensus of
opinion and feeling, however, may be
summed up in the growl of a veteran Dem
ocrat, who said : "Mr. Cator has bunkoed
the Demccraiic purly iv many of the inte
rior counties and has got a number of his
men on the legislative ticket, if he elects
them it will be without the help of the
real Democrats of California. I wonder
if he can do it."
AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
"Forty years ago I emigrated from Ireland to
Australia, and 1 have just returned from my
first visit in all those years to the land of my
birth, the country I left as a youne man,"
said J. SI. Dargaville of Auckland, N. Z.. as he
lay yesterday in his apartment at the Palace
Hotel, pale and still suffering from the effects
of a severe illness contracted while passing
through the Suez Canal on his pilgrimage to
the Emerald Isle. He had come to be a pros
perous banker and business man in Australia
before he moved to Auckland and became
prominent in public life. For years past he
has been a member of Parliament in New
Zealand, being repeatedly returned to his seat
in the chief legislative body of that colony.
"At the time I left Ireland there were pov
erty, starvation and death on all sides among
the peasantry. It was during the dreadful
potato famine. It was vividly impressed upon
my mind. Deaths were so numerous that cof
fins could not be made fast enough and false
bottoms were used, so that the coflin could be
lowered into the grave and then pulled out
afterward for service elsewhere. 1 wai amazed
and delighted to gee the improvement in the
Irish peasantry. They are well-to-do and pros
perous. All arpund they are far better oS than
the peasantry of England and Scotland. The
great change is mainly owing to the conces
sions made to them in legislation. I am
pleased at tne disposition of the English peo
ple to do the fair and right thing by the Irish
in redressing all possible grievances. I say
this, too, believing that I am just as mu^ of
an Irishmanâ just as loyal a native as can be
found anywhere. Credit is due the Irish for
having persistently fought for their rights and
the English Parliament for having felt that
there were real grievances to be redressed.
â¢'As far as I have traveled 1 have become
convinced, though, that there is no country
on earth to be compared with New Zealand
in climate, soil, natural resources and charac
ter of population."

Letters From the People.
ARE POPULISTS DISHONEST
Are Opponents Honest in Charging Them
With ltishonealy?
To the Editor of the San Francisco Calfâ Sib:
Lincoln won his way from ODSCurity to the
highest place oi honor among meu and became
the typical American and statesman of our
century with simple, rugged honesty as his
rule of life. His deep sincerity impressed It
self upon all who met him on his way up step
by step until he at last stood in the pride of a
noble manhood on tne mount of fame and
glory as en honest man. "Honest Old Abe"
won the hearts of the people and they made
him President, and then they trusted him as
still honest all through that terrible ordeal
when the Nation itself was in peril. It was he
who said, relying upon the good sense and in
tegrity oi his countrymen, when demagogues
sought to turn them jiom him : "You can fool
all ot the people some of the time, some of the
people all the time, but not all of the people
all of tne time."
In 1857 I met "Abe" Lincoln, as we then
called him, one evening in the "barroom" of a
"tavern" in Bloomington, 111., surrounded by
a group of eager listeners. I joined the group
as they stood about that plain, simple-hearted
man. He was talking on human rights and
deiendfng the rights of the negro as a man. I
was born of pro-slavery parentage and bred to
hate abolitionists, but tne pleading sincerity
of those eyes, the. tenderness oi that earnest
voice, the beaming honesty of that' homely
face, the reasonableness of every urgent word
he said, ere I was aware of it had disarmed
my deep-seated prejudice, and in the half-hour
beiore he said, in his off-band way, "Well,
boys, I must go to bed," I was awed as never
beiore with the majesty of rugged honesty,
with a deep sense of fair play, with a ruling
purpose to seek the truth regardless of results
to myself, and in good time I became a "Lin
coln" man and an abolitionist myself.
It seems to me that I miss in the present
campaign the Lincoln element of rugged hon
esty, ofmanly fair play, of simple sincerity,
of a ruling desire to get at the truth and state
it fairly and kindly so as to satisfy the heart,
convince the mind and enlist the whole man
to do battle for the right solely as the right,
and because the right should prevail for the
good of all. both for those whose personal in
terests lead them to oppose it and for those
who defend it. I read The Call every morn-
Ing and try in fairness to weigh the argu
ments put forth in favor of the election of Mc-
Kinley and by McKinley himself, aud I desire
to say a word to iair-mindedmen, it being use
less to address mere blind partisans, as to why
I think Ihe Call itselt and the whole oi the
Republican orators are not doing the fair
thing by the Populist* in charging them with
being repudiators and in favor of a dishonest
settlement of the National debt. We are all
American citizens and have a common inter
est in the welfare of our country whjether we
have political sense enough to see It or have
so much party sense as not to see it.
In the first place, if the free coinage of silver
would result in repudiation and disnonesty,
as the Republicans say it would, and say hard
things about us for advocating it, what have
they to say about the concurrent resolution
introduced by Senator Matthews, afterward
Justice Matthews, which passed in the Senate
by 48 ayes to 16 noes and in the House of Rep
resentatives by 189 ayes to 79 noes, being
more than cwo-thirds in both houses, Major
McKiulev, the Republican candidate for tne
Presidency, being one of the 189 who voted
for it? If Populists arerepudiators, as Repub
licans charge every day, what can they say of
the Republican Congress and Major McKinley
Himself when they passed tne Matthews con
current resolution? Have the Republicans of
189t> forgotten this action of their party?
Let me remind tnein of it by quoting it here
for their consideration: "Be It resolved by
the Senate (the House of Representatives con
curring therein), that all the bonds issued or
authorized to be issued under the acts of Con
gress (hcis to strengthen the public credit, of
March 18, 1869, act to authorize the refunding
ol the National debt, of July 14, 1870, act for
the resumption of specie payments, of Janu
ary 14, 1875) are payable, principal and in
terest, at the option of the Government of the
United States, in silver dollars of the United
States containing 412^ grains each of stand
ard silver; and that to restore to its coinage
said silver coins as a legal tender in payment
of said bonds, principal and interest, is not in
violation of the public faith, nor in derogation
of the rights of the public creditor."
You will observe that there is no proviso of
any kind requiring such restoration to be "by
international agreement of the leading com
mercial nations of the earth," but it is a purely
Populistic independent National coinage act,
and stated iv more vigorous and explicit
words than in the Populist platform. Mark
these words: "And that to restore to its coin
age said silver coins as a legal tender in pay
ment of said bonds, principal and interest/is
not in violatiou of the DUblic faith, nor in
derogation of the rights of tne public creditor."
This is the law to-day, and the law is just
and fair; as the Republican Congress said,
"it is uot in violation of the public faith, nor
in derogation of the rights of the public cred
itor," or bondholder. In the light of this law
it seems to me that the charge of repudiation
made by Republicans against the Populists
and Mr. Bryan, their candidate for the Presi
dency, is not honest, certainly not as Lincoln
understood honesty.
In the second piece, I fail to see how the
restoration of silver to its coinage by inter
national agreemeut, if that were possible when
the nations necessary to the agreement are stub
bornly opposed to it.could change tne character
of the act except to make it include all the lead
ing commercial nations of the earth, and thus
make "repudiation," if it be any &udu thing,
practically universal instead of confining It to
the United States. In this also it seems to me
that the Republican party is not consistent,
fair and honest in charging' Populists with
dishonesty and repudiation.
As a young Republican, In 1860, Itemember
that the wealth and "conservatism" of the
country were against Lincoln, as they are
against Bryan iv 1890, but the hearts of the
plain people turned to him as they seem now
to turn to Bryan, who goes among them and
speaks their thoughts in the plain tongne they
understand, just as Lincoln aid in 1860. There
is a gloomy outlook for the Republic if the
people wno look to Bryan as a second Lincoln
are indeed repudiators and given over to dis
honesty, for they are mostly native-born
Americans, and include about half the popu
lation of our country. If a war came the
country would be lost if the supporters of
Bryan are repudiators and dishonest, for tne
millionaires and corporations who oppose
Bryan are not noted for patriotism and a
readiness to enter the ranks as soldiers in de
fense of their country.

Connecticut District contains the following:
"You can say, if you please, to your friends
that they will have to stand four years of Mc-
Kinley whether they like It or not. It will be
the most notable victory in the history of the
Republican party, with the possible exception
of the Grant campaign of 1872. We have no use

making faces at them from his safe position
in the howdah on the elephant's back.
"You have heard from the Green Mountain
boys and from Maine, and the vote of the
other Northern States will be equal in fact,
and McKinley's popular majority will be
measured by the hundreds of thousands; not
less than a quarter of a million for New York

The San Francisco Call recently sent circu
lars to a large number of commercial travelers
asking for whom they intend to vote. In
response about 200 answers nave been re

largely increase in consequence. The Bryan

Now that the Valley road is ; ready for the
work of general transportation, it becomes the
duty of fverv producer to give all the business
'in his control to this truly competitive enter
prise, even if he shoula thereby Incur a little
extra trouble. .
All money paid to the Valley road goes to the
enterprising men of this State, and will re
main among us. It helps to enrich the StatÂ«,
and indirectly benefits all residents of the
State. On the other hand, the bulk of the
money paid to the Southern Pacific is sent
abroad to support foreign bond-holding^ para
sites. This means a dimimshment of the basis
of our National and commercial credits, and
the consequent impoverishment to that ex
tent of the entire Nation.
The sooner bonded railroad concerns go
into the bands of receivers the better for the
mass of producers who now support an army
of luxuriating lordllngs, squandering in
gilded indulgence the wealth produced in
this country. . . ,

channel, about one mile southwest from the
Skagit River post iight.

The catch of the whaling bark Northern
Li-:ht was yesterday given as four whales.
Captain Mason of the Jeanie, after looking

was six whales, and Captain Mc.Kenzie's
friends are correspondingly jubilant.
An unusually large fleet of deep-water
sh;ps got in yesterday. They were from
all parts of the world, and many of them
are seeking charters, while others are
"chartered prior to arrival." Judging
from the present condition of the wheat
market those "seeking charters" will have
the best of the bargain. Among tne ves
sels that got in were: The British ships
Albyn, 77 days from Newcastle, N. 8. W. ;
Prankistan, 144 days from Liverpool; Bay
of Bengal, 49 days from Valparaiso, and
the bark Merom from a fiphing cruise and
the schooner Bonanza from Fox Island.
All the arrivals report light winds and
fogs off the coast.
Captain Williams of the A?byn was anx
ious to reach port, so he prepared to fire a
mortar in order to attract the attention of
a tupboat. Two of the sailors were ram
ming home the powder when suddenly it
went off. The ramrod was driven through
the ship's bulwarks, making quite a hole,
while the two sailors are carrying their
arras in slings. The men are not badly
injured, and will be quite well before the
Albyn is ready to sail. The Bonanza had
a fairly successful passage. She brought
down a couple of cannery managers, who
were anxious to reach San Francisco.
Tbe battle-ship Oregon will start on her
first cruise in a few days. A three days'
run out to sea is to be made, and during
that time target practice will^e in order,
and a thorough test of the battle-ship's
Die guns will be made. On her return she
will tie up at Sausalito and await instruc
tions from tbe Secretaiy of the Navy.
The Aiert and Monadnock went to Mare
Island yesterday. The former will receive
a thorough overhauling, and will then go
to Honolulu to relieve the cruiser now sta
tioned there. The Bennington will re
main on the sound for a few weeks to test
the coal from the various mines, and the
flagship Philadelphia will probably ar
rive here in the course of a week or ten
days.
Captain Morgan of the British ship An
drosa has a curious story to tell about the
manner of loading a ship with nitrate at
Caleta Buena. "One man did the job,"
said he yesterday. "Each sack of nitrate
averaged 250 pounds, and that fellow
used to put into our hold about 300 tons a
day. He was a customs official, and had
to handle evVry thing that went into tne
vessel. Each sack as it came from the
waeon was placed on his shoulders, and
he would then run along the plank and
drop it on the deck. After that the crew
had to handle it. That man carried aboard
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 13, 1896.
my ship over 3000 tons of freight in ten
days, and then seemed anxious for more
work. Of course the distance he had to
carry the nitrate was not great, but then
figure out the number of trips he made,
and imagine how you would like the job.
Just imagine a United States customs of
ficer carrying 3000 tons of wheat aboard
my ship in order to keep tally of what
went into the hold."
The steamer Alvira, which struck a
snag in Steamboat Slough and sank, has
been raised and is now on the California
Transportation Company's drydock at
Wood Island on the Sacramento River.
The damage was considerable, but in a
few weeÃs the vessel will be running
again. She will receive a thorough over
hauling, and will be sheathed with hard
wood in order to prevent another disas
ter of a similar character.
Work on the rebuilding of Folsom-street
wharf is being rushed. Yesterday the first
of the cylinders to cover the piles was
driven, and by Friday the work of filling
in the concrete will begin. The new pier
is to surpass Pacific street in beauty and
strength, and is to be the finest structure
of its kind on the water front.
The Oceanic Company's Australia went
from the sugar rennery to the drydock
yesterday. She will receive a thorough
overhauling prior to her departure for
Honolulu on her next trip.
Captain Dan Haskell, ex-master of the
Fearless and now pilot, has been assigned
to the Boriita, the smartest pilot-boat on
the Pacific Coast. Captain Dan will begin
his first cruise on the 15th inst.
The tug Sea Queen while on her way to
sea yesterday struck a floating pile and
broke two of the blades of her propeller.
She managed to reach her dock, but will
be laid up for a couple of weeks in conse
quence of the break.
The Vallejo ferry steamer Monticello has
been laid up in order to get new boilers
put in. She will be thoroughly over
hauled and will then make three trips a
day between Vnilejo, Mare Island and San
Francisco.
A small crutch and a lunch-banket were
found on Howard-street wharf yesterday
and everybody is wondering whether a
little cripple boy lost his life or not. Tbe
lunch was partly eaten by tbe rats, but
enough remained to show that the lad was
well supplied with food. A short time
I before the crutch and basket were found
Henry Peterson, the oarsman, saw a man
lurking among the lumber, but whether or
â  not be knows anything about the matter
remains to be seen. The harbor police are
making a thorough investigation of the
matter. ____^_^__^^
FIRED AT BY HER LOVER
Minnie Drossel, Variety Actress,
Wounded in the Hand
and Cheek.
The Police Are Looking for a Sailor
Named Hermann, Who Used
the Revo ver.
Minnie Drossel is an actress in the
People's Variety Theater on the Barbary
Coast and has a lover in the person of a
sailor named Hermann. Minnie has not
reciprocated the sailor's passion, and this
nearly led to her death early yesterday
morning.
Minnie lives at 706 Battery street, and
in the early mornings Hermann would
follow her from the theater to her home
making violent protestations of love on
the way. Minnie made her first appear
ance at the theater three weeks ago, and
from that time Hermann has been press
ing his suit.
She spoke to some of her friends about
Hermann and begged them to nse their
influence with him that he might cease
annoying her. They went to him, but he
only laughed at them and told them he
would do what he pleased.
Saturday night he insulted her before
the audience and made things generally
disagreeable for her. When she left the
theater for her home, about 4 o'clock yes
day morning, he went up to her and paid
he would see her home. She warned him
not to follow her, otherwise ?he would
notify the police ; but he was obdurate.
||She returned to the theater and slipped
out of a side door. She ran to her home
and just as she bent down to insert ihe
key 4n the locK of the front door Her
mann came up behind her and fired a shot
at her. The bullet grazed her left ear and
cheek. She raised her left hand and Her
mann fired again, the bullet passing
through her hand. She shrieked with
pain and Hermann disappeared.
The wounded woman was taken to the
Receiving Hospital in the patrol wagon,
where her wounds were dressed by Dr.
Stice. Hermann has not yet been ar
rested, but the police expect to have him
at any moment.
AN ATTORNEY IN JAIL.
John Hogan Get* Six Month* for
swindling Painters.
John Hogan, an attorney, was sent to
the County Jail for six months by Judge
Campbell yesterday for obtaining money
by false pretenses.
The complaining witness was George T.
Ireland. Ireland testified that through
an advertisement he went to Hogan; who
represented that he was attorney for B.
M. Jennings, a large property-owner in
Oakland. Jennings wanted a number of
residences in Oakland painted, and Hogan
contracted with Ireland to do the work,
Ireland paying him $6 for drawing up tbe
contract. An investigation showed that
Jennings was a myth and Ireland and sev
eral other painters had been swindled out
of their money.

RESOLVED TO
DIE TOGETHER
Louis Edwards and His
Wife Nellie Tired
of Life.
While Staying for the Night in
a Friend's House He Turns
on the Gas.
ONE DEAD, THE OTHER ALIVE.
The Wife Says That Excessive Indu â 
gence in L quor Was the Cause
of the Rash Act.
A husband and wife driven to thoughts
of suicide ti -ough an unconquerable ap
petite for strong drink resolved to die
together yesterday morning. His body is
in the Morgue and she is in a fair way to
recovery at the Receiving Hospital.
Louis Edwards and his wife Nellie lived
at 328 Third street. lie had charge of the
lunch counter in the Chicago Saloon,
Tbfrd and Everett streets. Their only
child, a boy about 3 years of age, lives
with his aunt, Mrs. Freel, 704 Fulton
street, where he has a good home.
Sunday night Mrs. Edwards paid a visit
to her iriend, Mrs. Mabal Andrews, 403
Minna street. Edwards joined her there
after the saloon was closed for the night.
Liquor was plentiful and after several
hours Edwards and his wife were induced
to stay all nipht instead of going to their
own home. What time they retired is not
known.
About i o'clock yesterday afternoon
Mrs. Aadrews was attracted to the bed
room occupied by Edwards and his wife
by a strong smell of gas. She opened the
door and was almost suffocated by the
gas that poured out of the room. The jet
was turned on, and after turning it off she
gave the alarm.
The couple were in bed. A hasty exam
ination showed that Edwards was beyond
human aid, but his wife was alive, al
though unconscious. The Coroner was
notified and at tbe same time tbe ambu
lance was summoned from the Receiving
Hospital.
Edwards' body was taken to the Morgue
and Mrs. Edwards was driven to the hos
pital, where Dr. Bunnell applied the usual
remedies, and in a short time sne partially
recovered consciousness and was able to
make a statement.
"Drink has done this," she said. "My
hnsbiind and I have been drinking heav
ily. I went to Mrs. Andrews' last night
and he came there after the saloon was
closed. We wore all drinking and 1 have
no recollection of goins to bed.
"I remember we woke up and the sun
was shining. My husband said, 'Nellie,
let's die together.' I didn't say anything,
as I felt too sick. He got out of bed and I
suppose turned on the gas, as I Boon fell
asleep again and remembered nothing

THE ELMORE ESTATE
Decision by the Supreme Court Revers
ing an Earlier Decision Con
cerning 96500.
The Supreme Court has given a decision
in the case of Susan B. Elmore, as admin
istratrix of the estate of Sarah F. Elmore,
deceased, against James G. Elmore. The
court below rendered an ordinary money
judgment in favor of the plaintiff for
$6500, with costs. The Supreme Court re
verses this judgment and orders a new
trial, because neither the complaint nor
the findings sustain the judgment ren
dered, and "the cause of action, if any, es
tablished by the findings is wholly differ
ent from the one averred in the <tom
plainl."
The deceased, Sarah t. Elmore, was the
wife of tbe appellant. The complaint set
up that during her lifetime and during
her married life she received certain prop
erty from the estates of her deceasad par
ents, which wa3 nioHy in the form of
money; that she furnished this money to
tne appellant, as l*Â»r agent and trustee, to
purchase lands and personal property ;
that he purchased lands, taking the con
veyances in his own name, and that he, to
some extent, mingled the money of tbe
wife with the community property, so
that it became difficult to state exactly
what was her interest in the land so pur
chased, but the plaintiff believed that at
least one-half the lands and one-half of
certain personal property was bought by
the appellant and is held by him as trus
tee for the deceased wife. The amount
which the lower court awarded, &JSOO, whs
the exact amount which Sarah V. Elmore
inherited from the estate of her parents.
THREATENS THEIR
CHRISTIAN WORK
Â£ree Silver Means the
Recall of Half the
Missionaries.
Views of Dr. Homer Eaton,
National Methodist
Treasurer.
WARNS SINCERE CHURCHMEN.
Explains How Free Si ver Would
Strike Death to the Cc.use in
Foreign Fields.
Dr. Homer Eaton, treasurer of the Mis
sionary Society of the Methodist Episco
pal church and a member of the firm of
Eaton & Main of the trreat Methodist
book concern of New York, now on a visit
at the Occidental, declares that the free
coinage of silver would mean death to the
foreign missionary work of the Methodist
church.
"Our society," said he yesterday, "dis
bursed last year |1,237,845 62. Of that
amount $624,977 99 went into foreign mis
sions. Under a silver basis half of that
would have been utterly lost to us.
"We will have to call in half of our men
if the Chicago platform wins. The effect
of free coinage cannot be anything but a
disaster. Those people at the Chicago
convention haire gone wild over this idea.
There sre many good Methodists and sin
cere Christians among them, and I have
no doubt of their sincerity in their delu
sion. When an Eastern banker or mer
chant talks to them they look on what he
says with suspicion. His motives appar
ently are all mercenary. I do not speak
as a banker, as a politician or 3i> Eastern
man, and I say that the free coinage of
silver means ruin for the foreicn mission
ary work of the Methodist Episcopal
church.
"Our society is run on a regular bank
ing principle. Our missionary board
makes appropriations. The money is
under my control. Drafts on myself as
treasurer of the society are sent out to pay
the appropriations to our foreign mission
ary worn, and these drafts are cashed by
banks all over the world, and they are al
ways honored when presented at my office
for payment. Tne commercial world,
civilized and heathen, is practically on a
gold basis. We have reason to know that.
*'or instance, China is a silvar country
and is running nominally on a silver
basis. But it is a most notable comment
on the currency question that there is not
a single bank in all China that will touch
one of our drafts or give it a moment's
consideration unless the word 'gold' is
stamped across tne face of it. We cannot
get money from any of those banks unless
we promise to pay them back in gold. We
have no choice in the matter. It is 'no
gold, no advance on the drafts.' We can't
get along without those drafts, and so,
finally and conclusively, we must have
gold.
"As it is in China, so it is everywhereâ
in Asia, Africa and Europe, wherever our
missionaries are stationed. We are not
like v the big commercial housos; our deal
ings are not confined to particular parts
of the world specifically adapted to one or
another branch of trade. We don't care
at all whether the people of the countries
into which we go have things to buy or to
sell. Ihe teaching of Christianity is not
following any such restricted plan of
operation; it goes literally everywhere.
Now, under the present gold standard of
the United States we have no difficulty in
meeting these demands for gold payment.
We can give them all the gold they want
and as fast as they want it. Tbe money
in our treasury is every bit of it as good
as '.old. Practically speaking it is gold,
for we can turn it into gold whenever we
wish. That being the case, everything is
plain sailing. We get the full utility of
every cent that is subscribed to our mis
sionary fund. There is no loss for ex
change.
"With a silver standard in this country
we would be terribly crippled. We would
have to buy gold to meet our drafts, and
gold could only be secured by paying a
high premium. We would have to spend
needed money to pay these premiums on
gold, money that is now being used in
legitimate church work. It would cut us
way down. At least half of our foreign
workers would have to be called in on the
day the people of this country declared for
fifty-three-cent dollars. Every dollar that
is given to the cause of Christian work
abroad would be worth just its commercial
value as silver. They do not care in China
whetner it is worth a dollar's worth of
goods in the United States or not; if it

GEOLOGISTS FROM YUKON
Unshaven Scientists Bring Government
Information on Gold Fields.
Three queer-looking men, closely resem
bling each other in general appearance,
arrived at tbe Grand Hotel yesterday
evening. They are T. C. Schrader, J. E.
Spurr and H. B. Goodrich of the United
States Geological Survey. Six months ago
the}' were sent to Alaska by the Govern
ment to make an official examination of
the gold fields of the great Yukon, and
twenty days ago having completed their
investigations they started from the mouth
of the Yukon in the steamer Bertha for
this port. For over three months they
had been tramping alone over the gold
district adjacent to the Yuson River.
The Government particularly desired to
know the prospects for bedrock mining
along the Yukon. These scientists have
a ravorable report to submit.
One of them said last night:
"We examined ail the gold-bearing
gulches of the Yukon River down to Si.
Michael's on the coast. Only placer min
ing bas thus far been attempted in that
region, and a good deal of cold is being
taken out. The product is sure to increase
year by year for some time. I do not
know of any larger placer mining district
in the country than that. A mineral belt
similar to the so-called mother lede of
California runs across that whole country
in a northwest direction and along it there
are deposits in distinct and different for
mations. The indications are that bed
rock mining will be developed there in the
future and it will pay, but, of course,

WHY THEY CHOKED
AT THE CHARTER
It Is Denounced in Speeches
and Strong Reso
lutions.
Mass-Meeting at the Metropolitan
Temple Elicits Decided
Opinions.
MAYOR'S PROPOSED POWERS.
Provisions Concerning Tint Official
Give Rise to a Great Share of
the Free Criticism.
An anti-charter meeting was held last
evening at the Metropolitan Temple. The
audience was very large, crowding the
auditorium to its full capacity. J. Leg
gett presided an i called the meeting to
order. The proceedings were opened with
an organ prelude, "America" and other
patriotic melodies.
Mr. Leggett made a few preliminary re
marks. He began by saying that only in
V^. McArthur, James H. Barry and J. M. Reynolds, Three of the Speakers at the Big Auditorium
Meeting Last Night.
this country are such gatherings possible.
The purpose of the meeting was to con
sider whether the proposed new charter,
which had been advocated by some, would
if adopted be beneficial to the City. That
question should be carefully considered.
San Francisco needs a charter. The City
was given the right to adopt a charter un
der the new constitution. At present
there is confusion and much misunder
standing.
He at first held back from opposition to
the charter proposed; but he had reached
the conclusion that he was unab:e, as a
good citizen, to vote for the new charter.
He had tried to swallow it; be choKed,
and could not get it down. His first ob
jection is that the charter is undemocratic,
and that is sufficient to comdemn the
whole instrument There are people
standing higb who doubt still the ability
of the people to covem themselves. He
did not have any such doubt.
Democratic government has not ful
filled its mission in all respects. Thomas
Jefferson, could he be cognizant of the
events of the past twenty-five years, would
have found much that he couid not ap
prove; but it would be unjust to suppose
that Jefferson would therefore conclude
that a democratic form of government is
a failure. The trouble has been that the
Government has not been democratic
enough, f and too little faith has been
placed In the people. The dangerous time
ia when the people go to and the
politicians and so-called statesmen have
time and opportunity to do their nefarious
work. The hopeful time is when the
people are roused to defend their rights.
The proposed charter took away, he con
tinued, from the people the power to elect
their own officers. It took the power from
the people and gave it to an autocratic
Mayor. He would never vote lor any in
strument which would take from* the
people the power to name their own of
ficers. He tnought that one of the worst
features of the charter was its narrow and
un-American provision concerning the
School Department. He did not believe
that it was true that only those who have
been educated in the ban Francisco public
schools are able to instruct. Ii an educa
tional Chinese wall was erected around
San Francisco it would not be long before
all reason for priiie in the San Francisco
public school system wou d disappear.
There were unconstitutional measures
proposed in the charter. That ought to
condemn it. The 900 intelligent school
teachers in the public schools were in
themselves a sufficient reason for op
posing the new charter. They were almost
as a unit opposed to it. He wanted every
thing done thai, could bo done to bury the
charter out of si,ht. He introduced
James H. Barry as "the brave, eloquent
and disinterested friend of the people."
Mr. Barry was greeted with cheery and
applau-e which lasted some time. He
said that he, at first, wauie-l to support
the new charter and labored day and
night to fin t good features. He found
that there might be a way to get rid of
the eternal and rotten Police Commission
and that would be good, but when he had
found ono good leaiure he had found
others which made him say that it were
better to bear the ills we have than fly to
tho.-e we know not of. The City has
needed a new charter for eighteen "years,
but it would be better to wait eighteen
years more thau to adopt the charter now
proposed. He dd not want to surrender
his constitutional rights. He styled the
Mayor, as provided for in the new char
ter, a Czar.
It is said that the Mayor would have
only the same power as the President of
the United States. That was enough rea
son to oppose the measure. For vow we
have a man as President who acts not
as it he was our President, but as if be
was a being who could do no wrong. He
cent troops into Illinois and Colorado
when no overt acts had been committed.
He practicably told the Supreme Court
that the anti-Chinese law waÂ« unconsti
tutonal, and exercised his influence in a
way not contemplated by th- constitution.
It would not do to make the Mayor
autocratic. It behoov-d voters to vote
for the best candidates so that '"if that
infamous instrument shall, by chance, be
a lopted. we sbatl be as well represented
as jiossible." Ti,e new charter would be
hard to change if it sb uid not be satis
actory. An amendment coulil not be
made. The corpoiations have controlled
seven or nine Supervisors. Huw much
easier it wou.d be to control three Super
visors than to control nine. It would take
three-fifths of the Supervisors and three
tiftb* of the Dcoi'le and ihen a majority
of the two houses oi the Legislature to
amend the charter. Under it the people
surrender their rights.
A voice â It is ridiculous.
Barryâ lt is worse than ridiculous; it
is infamous.
"Th In mis of the charter," Mr. Barry
said, "averred that tlie Supreme Court
would decide in a certain way. How do
do they know? 1 know about the Supreme
Court. It once sent me to jail for con
tempt and I have not had the greatest re
spect for it ever since. The Supreme
Court can reverse itseli from one
day to another. The Supreme Court de
cisions in New York are sold as a joke
book. The proper thing to do is to knock
out the charter and not wait for the deci
sion of the Supreme Court concerning it."
Mr. Barry spoke of Dr. Taylor, who
helped to prepare the new charter, and
said Taylor had told him (Barry) that no
respectable man would vote against it. A
respectable man. Dr. Taylor probably
thought, is one who does not work ior a
living. But there were respectable men
who would go into the booths and vote
against the new charter, but they were not
highly respectable. Dr. Tavlor said in
sunstance that if the freeholders have not
prepared a charter, the Supreme Court
will make one. Taylor admitted that
tnere were no provisions for the election of
a Mayor. The Governor would appoint
the Mayor, and the Mayor would appoint
a long list of officers.
Mr. Barry said that under the new
charter any man who should be arreateil
and convicted of crime can be either im
prisoned or put to work in the chain gang
at the option of the Boar I of Supervisor*.
"Think of the Solid Seven and then think
of that! How shall I put it? Suppose
we put it that the S >lid Seven are put in
the cnain yane and that the criminals are
put in the Board of Supervisors. There
ar- no worse criminals, and I speak ad
visedly, than there are now in the Board
of Supervisors making laws for San
Francisco."
In two years, Mr. Barry said, pro
portional representation would be
adopted. It was worth while to wait
two years for that before adopting a
charter. It was impossible for any man
to vote all right. There were 580 nomina
tions, and these nominations were made
by the bosses. The people wc-e not to
blame, out the system on which prima
ries were conducted was to blame. Under
the provision for the using of convicts in
the chain gang they will be brought into
competition with free labor. Who will
have the use of the convicts? The corpo
rations will have them. Mr. Barry closed
with a quotation from James Russell
Lowell and advice to "vote against this :
iniamous instrument." Mr. Barry spoke
in behalf of the American Women's Lib
eral League.
W. McArthur spoke on behalf of the
San Francisco Labor Council. Before he
began his speech he offered resolutions
for adoption which had a long preamble.
T:ie resolutions and preamble were as
follows:
Whereas, Freeholders were elected by the
citizens of San Francisco in November, 1804.
for the purpose -i drafting a new charter
which should remedy existing defects in the
City government ; and whereas, the freehold- j
ers have failed to carry out this purpose aud
on t tie contrary have submitted a charter
which not only does not remedy existing de
fects in the laws of the City, but aggravates j
them by the addition of other evils; aud i
wnereas. the following Rre among the most I
objec.ionable features of tfc-e proposed charter:
Firstâ The great power vested m the Mayor
practically amounting to the disfranchise
ment oi the citizens.
Secondâ Provisions preventing municipal |
ownership of streetcars, water, gas and elec
tric plants.

Whereas, The campaign now being made
in favor of the proposed charter is based upon
a false theory of responsibility on the part of
tne Mnyor and the admission that several of
its most objectionable features are unconsti
tutional and will therefore be stricken out by
the Supreme Court, accompanied by the reser
vation that, with all its laults, the proposed
charter is no worse than the present consoli
dation act, and should, thereiore, be adopted
for the mere sake of a change, now therefore
be it
Resolved, That we, the citizens of San Fran
cisco, in mass-meeting assembled, do express
our unqualified disapproval of the proposed
charter, and pledge ourselves to work and
vote agains; it at the coming election; and be
it further
Resolved, That we will work for a charter
which shall be new in fact as well as in name,
a charter which shall permit of the govern
ment ot our city upon progressive lines and
which sha.l operate to the extension of popu
lar government and the progress and prosper
ity of the commonwealth.
Mr. McArtbur spoke strongly against
the new charter amplifying the points
contained in the preamble and resolu
tions offered by him. Ue said that ne
wished that the resolutions might be put
to a vote at the close of the nieeung.
J. M. Reynolds ppoke for the Municipal
Reform League. He said that he would
not dwell on the new charter much. There
were present representatives of the L quor
d 'filers' Association, which has appointed
a small committee to do its thinking and
which will be so.d out. There are here
representatives of the A. P. A. who have
already been sold out. They have ap
pointed a small c <mmittee to do their
thinking and they will be Â«old out apain.
What has this to do with the new chart rY
.Mere.y that tne corporations will get with
the committees and the Liquor-dealers'
Association and the A. P. A.'s and the
wheelmen will all be found working for
the corporations. Do not let this happen.
Mr. Reynolds offered for consideration
a draft of a new charter proposed by him
self, which be called a bill of rights.
The resolutions proposed by Mr. Me-
Arthur were adopted and the meeting
was then adjourned.
OFFICIALS FAIL OUT,
Coolness Between the District
Attorney's and the Mar
shal's Oifice.
Alleged Failure to Promptly Srve
Subpenas Said to B One of
th Causes.
For some weeks past the relations be
tween tne United States Marshal's office
and the department presided over by
District Attorney Foote have been de-
Cidedly strained. One side has com
plained of too much assumption of
power, while the other has contended
that justice was otten thwarted through a
sheer dereliction of duty.
Tli's lrinidity between the two arms of
the law increased last week, when Dis
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 13, 1896.
trict Attorney Foote, in language more
forcible than elegant, ordered Chief
Deputy Marshal Farish out of his office,
even going so far as to attempt a physical
ejectment. The trouble culminated yes
terday, when Judge Morrow was forced to
adjourn court owing to the failure of
the principal witnesses in the first case
called to put in an appearance.
It appears that some days ago the action
of the Government a ainst Edward Pettit
of Santa Rosa, charged with raising a $1
bill to the denomination oi $20, was placed
on ti.e trial calendar, to be taken up
yesterday. When the case was called it
developed that the two principal witnesses
for the Government were not on hand. In
fact they bad not been served, though
Marshal Baldwin declared t"at every ef
fort hat been made to secure service.
Judge Morrow was somewhat exasperated
at having to carry the case over and
sought to attach the blame to the District
Attorney's office. The court, however,
was soon convinced that the fault rested
with the Marshal's department. Assistant
Disrrict Attorney Schlessinger had caused
the subpenas to be issued last Tuesday,
and hence his office could not in any way
be held responsible .or errors committed
by Mr. Baldwin or his chief deputy, Mr.
Farrish.
It is stated that the Pettit case is only
one of many. The District Attorney's
office complain that they encountered the
same trouble in a more aggravated form
during the famous Williams trial.
The case of Otto Schmidt of Oakland,
charged with impersonating a treasury
officer, was also down for trial, but the de
fendant failed to appear. Hij bond of
$100 was declared forfeited and a bench
warrant issued Tor his arrest. Schmidt's
attorney said his client would have been
in court but anticipated that the Pettit
case would consume the morning session
and nis presence would not be desired un
til lat?r in the day. The calendar for the
day being exhausted, Judge Morrow was
forced to dismiss the jurors until Friday.

FATALLY STABBED.
A Chinese Junk Dealer Murderously
Attacked by Three High
binders.
Chang Luck Duck, a junk dealer living
at 613 Jackson street, was stabbed several
times last night, and the wounds will in
all probability prove fatal.

received it on Ijis left wrist. The murder
ous Chinese made two more slashes at
him, one cutting his lei t arm above the
elbow and the other his right hand. The
ti.ree then disappeared.
The wounded Chinese was taken to the
Receiving Hospital in the patrol wagon.
Dr. Bunnell lound that the wound in the
back was probably fatal, the knife having
penetrated to the left lung.
Three Chinese, Lee Yen Lum Ah Fong
and Go Ah Chung, are accused of the as
sault. They are said to be members of a
highbinder society and the wounded man
is a member of a rival society.

STOCKHOLDERS ARE GLAD.
Those Who I>eposltocl Money in the
Pacific Bank May Recover a Portion.
Judge Seawell yesterday filed an opin
ion wliich may materially alter future liti
gation in the Pacific Bank cases. It has
nitherto been the practice of the receivers
of the bank in paying dividends to the de-
positors of the defunct institution to pay
nothing to those depositors who were also
stockholders.
S. G. Murphy sued the bank for 30 per
cent of the deposit of J. M. McDonald, one
of the stockholders of the institution, -who
transferred his claim to Murphy. The de
fense was set up by the bank that accord
ing to the articles of incorporatio l tiled
under the law of 1862 McDonald as a stock
holder could not recover. His Honor,
however, sustained a demurrer to the an
swer, holding that the character of the
business done by the bank must be taken
into consideration in the matter. He says
he thinks that it would be an injustice to
the stockholders to assess them their per
centage of the debts of the bank and not
allow them payment for the debts the
bank owes them.
SELF-DEFENSE HIS PLEA
James Kelly Tells How He
Killed Joseph E. Quinn
and Why.
Claims the Dead Man Wou'd Have
Slain Him if He Could Have
Done So.
The prosecution having closed its case
evidence for the defense was yesterday in
troduced at the trial of James Kelly for
the murder of Soldier Joseph E. Quinn.
Kelly himself was upon the stand and
swore that he did not know he had killed
Quinn until he had been taken to the
guardhouse some time after the occur
rence. He also claimed that he struck in
self-defense, and believed that in doing
so he was using a last effort to save his
life.: ' â â¢' '"â  .-'"-.;*: -. ';--,-"â  :' .":â¢â -â ; :â â 
"If I hadn't used the razor I would now
likely be where Quinn is," .said, Kelly, in
answer to a question put by Prosecuting
I Attorney Hmkle.
The prisoner, whose looks are much Im-
I proved since he donned his uniform, was
j being cross-examined as to the particulars
of the fatal tight. He told how Quinn had
threatened 10 whip him and how, knife in
hand, he danced about him, , seeking an
opportunity to attack him. Kelly said he
took his razor from his pocket and opened
it, ready for action in case he should be
attacked, but that he had no idea of using
it if Quinn forbore his expressed inten
tion.
A number of Kelly's comrades testified
as to bis good character, his quietness and
general inoff ensiveness, while Quinn was
pictured the post bally, a man always
ready for a fight and physically â¢ the
superior of any other-man in the com- 1
mand. One of them swore that the open
pocket-knife found on the parade ground
, after the affray was the property of Quinn
and â¢ that he recognized it from the fact
{bat the dead man was wont to look upon
it as his mascot, he having a habit of plac
ing it upon the table before him whenever
he was gambling.
â  The 'attorneys for the defense are jubi
lant over the fact that so far no testimony
has been introduced which shows : that
their client had any malice against Quinn.
The trial will be continued to-day.

DEMOCRATS SHIVER
OVER THE BUNKO
Hon. Thomas V. Cator's
Schemes Make Them
Very Unhappy.
Populistic Legislative Nominees
Crowd Out Bourbon
Aspirants.
COULD NOT STEM THE CUBBENT
Even Senator Stephen M. White Ap
peared to Be Powerless South
of Tehachapi.
Thoughtful Democrats of California are
beginning to realize the extent of the
bunko game played on their party by
Thomas V. Cator and his coadjutors, and
in consequence Democratic cheeks flush
with shame whenever toe subject is
broached in their presence.
The leaders of the Democratic party are
aware of the shameful predicament of
their organization, brought about by the
fusion dickerings that have taken place in
regard to members of the Legislature, and
while they are fully alive to the degrada
tion of the "bargain and sale" that has
besmirched tbe fair fame of their party,
few who hold responsible positions in the
party are willing to express their inner
thoughts on the situation.
As a matter of fact the southern part of
the State, all that section south oi Teha
chapi, over which Senator Stephen M.
White is supposed to keep watch and
ward for the Democrats, has been de
livered, body and soul, to the Cator fac
tion of the Populist party.
In San Diego County tbe Democrats
conceded both Assembly nominations to
the Cator Populists, and in San Bernardino
and Orange, iv each of which one Assem
blyman is to be chosen, a similar plan was
followed.
Riverside County kicked out of the
traces to a certain extent and nominated a
Non-Partisan. Nobody pretended to
gauge his probable action on the Sena
torial question. He may resolve to sup
port what he considers the best man and
vote for himself.
In the joint Senatorial district of
Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside
counties it bad been agreed that the Dem
ocrats should have the nomination, and
they intended to put up an anti-corpora
tion Democrat who would not under any
circumstances vote for Cator; but the rail
road influence, which dominates San
Bernardino County Democratic politics,
came in and broke down the arrange
ment, so a Cator Populist was nominated.
There is a touch of grim humor in the
way things are manipulated by Cator and
his adherents in Los Angeles County,
where tbe Populists allowed the Demo
crats to nominate the State Senator in
deference to United States Senator White,
whereas it is positively known that under
no circumstances could any one except a
Republican be elected in that district.
The Populists also permitted the Demo
crats to take three Assembly nominations
Our great October Sale is proving a never-ending source of wonderment
and delight to the thousands who daily attend it â wonderment at the RIDIC-
ULOUSLY LOW FIGURES PREVAILING as the result of the PRODIGIOUS

in districts where there are practically
only Republican votes. The remainder
of the nominations in which there was a
ghost of a show for success they took to
themselves on the fusion basis.
Santa Barbara Democrats supinely
yielded the Assembly nomination to the
Populist aspirant, so Cator scored another
victory.
It was all fixed up in the usual smooth
manner that a Populist should be placed
on the Assembly ticket in Ventura County,
but a handful of old-line Democrats got
in and made such a clamorous protest
tnat the scheme had to be abandoned, and
a Democrat was nominated, thus illus
trating the fact that a little firmness on
the part of the genuine Democratic party
would have delivered that organization
from the humiliating subjection into
which it has been led. Inr the Senatorial
district of which Ventura is a part, out of
respect for Senator White the Democratic
Senator was not opposed by the Populists.
He has a chance to win, and if be iives
may be called on to vote for Mr. White
two years hence.
Cator fairly bulldozed the Democrats
into a fusion in San Luis Obispo County
and as the outcome a Populist was nomi
nated.
Kern County is known as a Democratic
stronghold, where a Democratic nomina
tion is equivalent to an ejection, yet
Btrange to relate, after a Democrat had
been nominated Cator and his cohorts
came along and dragged down the Demo
cratic choice and put up a Populist in
stead. This seems like carrying things
with a high hand, but it illustrates tne
flaccid condition of the Democratic will
throughout the State.
In the Assembly district composed of
Tulare and Kings counties a Populist was
Dominated without a protest. One of
Fresno's Assemblymen was apportioned
to the Populist party just as a courtesy to
Mr. Cator. No opposition.
In Stockton both the Assemblymen
were given to the Cator Ponulists, the rail
road interest favoring that plan with
might and main.
Other counties have been yielded to the
Populists by the Democrats, as follows:
Placer County, 1; Mono and Inyo (jointly),
1; butter and Yuba, the same; Tehama
aud Trinity, the same. '
The Populists also got two of their men
on the Assembly ticket in Humboldt
County, and also took Sonoma into camp,
as well as Contra Costa, Solano, Napa and
Santa Cruz, these latter having one nomi
nee each.
Alameda contributed three Populistio
nominees to Mr. Cator's possible quota
and Santa Clara gives two. In these
places, however, the election is what is
troubling the fusionist3 more than they
care to confess.
The Populists grew so emboldened by
their uninterrupted series of victories that
they decided that they could afford to
break faith with the Democrats in regard
to the senatorship for the district em
braced in Monterey and San Benito coun
ties. After they had tricked the Demo
crats into fusing on their candidate for
State Senator they declined to pull down
their Populist nominee, so there are now
three aspirants in the field â Republican,
Democrat and Populistâ -with the chances
in favor of the Republican obtaining a
good majority. o
In addition to these fusion arrange
ments, Populists aro running for the
Legislature on straight-out Populist
tickets in Shasta, Mann and Nevada
counties.
The situation in the City and County of
San Francisco is somewhat mixed. The
Democrats have generally refuse to co
alesce with the Populists, but in several
cases the Populists hav?j indorsed Demo
cratic nominees in order to carry out the
idea that they have been able to accom
plish the general fusion programme
throughout the State.
The bunko game has worked all right,
so far as the nominations are concerned,
but it remains to be seen whether the
Democratic voters will permit themselves
to be used in this shameful manner by a
few tricksters who have only their per
sonal aims and selfish purposes to ad
vance.

TO FIGHT FOR
CHEAP LUMBER
Oregon Lumbermen Will
Try to Break Down
the Trust.
Their Plan Will Bring Car
goes Direct to Local
Consumers.
COMPLAINTS OF THE TRUST.
Northern Lumbermen Say Their On!y
Chance Is to Fight the Com
binet on.
News reached a number of local lumber
dealers of San Francisco a few days ago
that an attempt will be made by a num
ber of Oregon and Washington lumber
dealers at an early date to break the trust
or combine said to control the local mar
ket.
"For the purpose of reaching this ob
ject," said Pembroke Anson of Salem, Or.,
yesterday, "an effort has been set on foot
to corral enough local dealers here to buy
a few million feet of lumber each year.
"Large mills are running at a loss at
Corvallis and other towns in Oregon
simply because their owners cannot get
into the combination and they are about
tired of the close corporation plans that
virtually give the entire business into
the hands of a few people. They have,
therefore, decided to try to break the
power of the trust, if possible, either by
starting large lumber-yards here or by ob
taining contracts with carpenters or con
tractors to take cargoes as they may
arrive at this port. This * would
cause a great deal of excitement
on steamer days. The plan would be to
organize a corps of anti-trust lumbermen,
who would always be ready to take a
given quantity on the arrival of the ves
sels, and without delay. The chief ob
jection to having lumber come to deal
ers in this way is that those who deal
outside of the trust are tabooed and
cannot buy lumber of the regular dealers.
Those trying to break the trust are seeking
to overcome this difficulty by arranging to
have all kinds of lumber on the ships that
arc free from the trust"
News of the intended scheme to break
the trust will no doubt create a stir among
builders and contractors, who have long
been seeking some method of relief. It is
not believed, however, that any ordinary
combination can greatly modify existing
rates, for lumber-dealers complain that
rates are already at bedrock.
Absconded With Jewelry.
J. Pope, tfifth and Bryant streets, swore to a
complaint in Judge Campbell's court yester
day charging C. C. Drake with misdemeanor
embezzlement. Drake was employed by Pope,
and on Saturday he was given an order on H.
Hoffman, h jeweler, for a Dair of diamond ear
rings and a breastpin. Drake got the jewelry
and has not been seen since.

NEW YORK MARKETS.
Financial. - â¢
NSW YORK. N. V., Oct. 12.â The stock market
was unsettled and irregular throughout, closing
weak in tone. At the opening the tendency was
downward on sales for both accounts. The promi
nent issues scored losses of Vi to I*4 per* cent, sugar
leading wi.h sales as low as lOSi/i. The general
market was adversely influenced by the advance
in discount abroad and a belief that the Bank of
England directors on Thursday will also put up
the rate. This, it was argued, will check the move
ment of go.'d this way unless the California bank
<rs offer additional inducements. ' Go.d here to
day commanded a commission of 1/g to % per
cent. Calls sold for I*4 to IV2 percent.
Notwithstanding the Higher discounts abroad
and the firmness of demand for sterling $50 0,000
of the metal was engaged in London for shipment
to this country. Money in the local market worked
close to the rating at 6@7 per cent until a late hour,
when unemployed balances were offered at 4 per
cent. .The comparative bareness of money led to
1 quidarions in certain quarters, especially as some
commission.bouses are not inclined to encourage
new ventures pending. After the drain referred
to tobacco advanced from 63 Vss to 70% and this
strengthened the general market for a lime.
The rise in Tobac-o was attributed to manipula
tion and covering of short accounts. In the late
afternoon trading the selling was renewed la the
Industrials. Learner and Ruuber were heavy,
selling to 55 Vi and 651/4. respectively. Sugar,
the Grangers, Manhattan and General Electric all
lacked support in the late trading. Speculation
closed weak. Net changes show losses of 14 to
li/Si except for Rubber preferred, whkh dropped
3 per cent. ' Northwestern and Tobacco gained
Vii to -1 per cent. Sugar, which was the most
active stock, figured lor 30.500 snares.
Bond, closed weak, with total sales of $870,000.

' CHICAGO MARKETS. . .
CHICAGO, lv.. Oct. 12.â Liverpool cables on
wheat this morning . did not colnciJe with onr
strength of Saturday nor with the sanguine belief
of the bulls that prices were yet too low. That in
cident and the estimate that the world's shipment
for last week would- approximate 10,250.000
bushels were the prime factor* at. the opening' of
the market here to-day. They were permitted ', to
govern the tone only temporarily, however, ad
vices troin San Francisco 10 the effect that the
demand for w!iea: from India and Australia still
existing started! the Crowd to buy. There was an
increase in the amount on ocean passage of
2,750,100 bushels and in the visible supply of
318.000 bushels. _ .

CORNâ The receipts of corn were 1609 cars, or
609 more than estimated. With this increase in

cline. When the fiver train rallied, however,
corn firmed up a little and prices recovered the
i loss. Withdrawals from store were 16.. 00 bush
i els. Liverpool cables were firm. - The amount on

DEATH OF "UNCLE JIM"
He Was an Old Naval Veteran,
Who Lived Eighty Three
Years.
Served Through the M xican War
and R.bellion and Had Many
N rrow Escapes.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Oct. 12. j
James Ryan, who has just died in Liver
more, was one of oldest veterans in this
county. He was born in Ireland 83 years
ago, and when pneumonia attacked him,
a few weeks ago, he fell an easy victim.
Uncle Jim, as he was known to hosts of
friends, was an old sea-fighter. He
fought for the United States throughout
the Mexican war and Rebellion upon the
high seas. He came to this country in
1830. In 1846 he was serving on an Ameri
can man-oi-war that anchored in Mon
terey Bay. During a fierce naval battle
of the Rebellion a shell carried away and
swept off the deck a gun and gunner who
stood by his side. Ryan was also in the
usual campaigns around Charleston and
up the Mississippi River.
Ryan had traveled all over the civilized
world and was lull of hair-breadth escape
stories and adventures. He left the ser
vice after the war and resided for several
years in Boston, where bis two sisteis still
reside. Jeremiah Rvan is his only surviv
ing brother, two other brothers having
died from exposures and hardships of the
same active life in the navy that "Uncle
Jim" endured.
The deceased has resided in this county
for the last lilteon years. Father Powers
officiated at the funeral of the old veteran
and M. Collier, M. Dooley, P. Callaghan,

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 13, 1896.
WITH HER CHILD
Oakland's Bloomer Divorcee
Marries at an Hour's
Notice.
A Gallant Bartender- Comes to
Her Relief in Open
Court.
MARRIED AT SACRAMENTO-
When She Became Mrs McLaughiin
the Judge Awarded Her tha
Littb Girl.
Oakland Office Ran Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Oct, 12. j
Mrs. Lulu Laro, who gained considerable
notoriety about a year ago by donning
bloomers and using a horsewhip on her
husband on Broadway, when she found
she had not a monopoly of his affections,
is married again. Only by wedding the
man to whom she said she was engaged
could she obtain possession of her little
child, which had been placed by the
father with a Mrs. Dreschler, in accord
ance with the decree of divorce.
Mrs. Laro after her divorce figured as
a leading attraction at a bloomer restau
rant that lived but a short time on Eighth
street. She then left Oakland and went to
Oregon, and later to bacramento, where
she became Mrs. McLaughiin, under very
romantic circumstances.
The case was called before Judge Hink
son, and Attorney Aram of Oakland repre
sented the father of th- little girl in the
dispute. Mrs. Laro floated into court
dressed in the height of fashion. She wore
a towerinir bonnet, a green silk waist,
balloon style, and a dainty little ki i belt.
When she took the stand Judge Hinkson
recalled to her mind some evidence re
arding her visits to the rear door of a cer
tain saloon.
Mrs. Laro assumed one of her naive
blushes that so captivated the lobby in the
Oakland courts and snid very modestly :
'â¢I am engaged to marry Mr. McLaughiin,
who is the bartender there, and I thougut
it was not wronir."
The Judge agreed with her, but Attor
ney Arau said that the marriage and con
sequent home for the little girl were but
pro pects, while Laro offered a tangible
home.
Judge Hinkson was about to return the
child to its mother's care for a few weeks
on probation, when a young mar. with a
coloied vest and a large pink rose in his
lapel approached her a.torney and whis
pered a few words.
"Your Honor," said Attorney Hart, "if
all that is warned is a mere home lor the
child, we'll attend to that. I will have
Mrs. Laro brought in here, and she and
Mr. McLaughiin will ask to be married by
your Honor."
Mrs. Lnro was so surprised at the sud
den and legal proposal to wed her sweet
heart instanter that she burst into sob?,
and the Judge adjourned the proceedings
for two hours so that Bhe might recover
her composure. The divorced bnsband
did not appreciate the situation, and fear
ing that he might be subjected to the
moriibcation of seeing his ex-wife mar*
ried to another as the only means of de
priving him of hn little child, he left.
After lunch the bride and groom ap
peared before the Judge and the ceremony
was performed. Mrs. Liro's age was
given as 23 and her husband's a3 32.
Before her marriage to Laro Mrs. Mc-
Laughiin was a Miss Lulu Turner. Her
comi>anion in the short-lived bloomer
restaurant. Miss Diana Pacheco, was
found dead in a room on Eighth street
some months ago. She and her lover,
who was not acceptable to her parents,
died from pis ol wounds.

uea.M of expense â rent, food and clothing.
More than halt of the whole number
helped to sup; ort the lamilies. After
quoting these figures he said:
"I. was necessity and not choice that
led these women to enter the workshop
and toil. The fact that only 701 of these
were free from paying a bo?.rrt bill shows
the small per cent that work for the priv
ilege of having extra spending money,
while the great number who help support
their families goes to prove the necessity
of work.
"Now, you want to know how we can
change this state of aff irs? I say only
by g ving them the bal.ot. When we ap
ply to the Legislature to enact laws for
the suppression of the sweatshop and
other evils' the politician looks at the in
fluence of the man's ballot and declares
he is powerless. When women can crush
him with the ballot he will be only too
glad to defend her. Whenever women
get the ballot iha politician will recognize
her ri^ht. Give them the ballot if you
would benefit their condition."

CLEVER WORK OF
A BOY INVENTOR
Produces a Library Indexer
That Is Said to Be
Perfect.
Many Practical Mechanics Had
Essayed the Task and Had
Given It Up.
WILL BE SENT TO STOCKTON.
Librarian Har bourne Had tbe Theory
and the Lad Soon Put It
Into Practice,
ALAMEDA, Cal., Oct. 12.â Librarian
Harbourne will attend the meeting of the
Librarians' Association of Central Cali
fornia at Stockton, and his most pleasant
task will be to explain the principle of
an Alameda boy's invention.
For a long time Mr. Harbourne has had
an idea of what would constitute a perfect
index for large libraries. Experience has
taught him just what is necessary, but he
has not till quite recently been able to
find any one who could take bis ideas and
pat them into practical shape. He placed
the matter before several experienced me
chanics, but with no succesa.
Finally Mr. Harbourne spoke to Charles
R. Weymouth, a lad but 19 years of age,
CHARLES R. WEYMOUTH, "Who Invented an Indexer That Had
Been for Years the Dream of Librarian Harbourne of Alameda.
of his idea. Weymouth, who is a student
in the mechanical department at the
Berkeley university, went to worK and ex
perimented for a long time with the
librarian's ideas. He worked early and
late and met with many failures, but
finally h? was successful and he produced
mechanically what Mr. Harbourne had
devised in theory.
The indexer was explained to the trust
ees of the library at their last meeting,
and they exprep-ied themselves as thor
oughly satisfied that young Weymouth
had produced a perfect indexer and or
dered a supply.
"I was never more surprised in my life,"
sai'i Librarian Harbourne, "to find how
completely the lad had carried out my
ideas. Several librarians have been over
here to see it and all are of the same opin
ion. I am going to explain it to the
librarians of Central California at their
annual meet'ng this week, and I must say
I am proud to show the handiwork of an
Alaroeda boy."
In outward appearance the new indexer
is an oak box, 28 mc es deep, 25 inches
broad and stands I feet high. In front is
a leaf the height of an ordinary writing
table.
From this np the face slants back and is
set with glass, exposing the names of the
books upon two continuous rolls of linen.
These are turned by a crank with the left
hand, leaving the right hand free to copy
off names and numbers of books wanted.
Thn interior mechanism consists of two
large spools on which 100 yards of linen
cardholder is wound. They are placed on
each of two parallel shafts, those belong
ing to the same cardholder being opposite
each other. These two shafts are rotated
by means of bevel gearwheels, placed on a
shaft perpendicular to the two parallel
shafts, which is itself connected to the
crank. There is a double worm which
automatically disengages one pair of gear
wheels and engages another pair whenever
the crank is reversed, thus causing the
cardholder to move either up or down.
An automatic brake arrests the motion of
the spools when the crank stops.
The operator by moving a lever in front
causes a clutch to move on the shafts,
making either cardholder move inde
pendently at will.

Friday night has been fixed at $40,000,
and the fire was the most disastrous con
flagration that has been in that city for
many years. The farmers' warehouse and
4500 tons of hay were totally destroyed.
The Fire Department did good work in
saving surrounding property, but could do
nothing with the blazing mass of hay in
the large corrugated iron warehouse.
Much dissatisfaction is expressed amone
the stockholders on the management of
the business regarding the insurance. The
Warehouse Company is a corporation, and
each share represents a stall in the build
ing of a capacity of eighty-five tons. Some
of the stockholders were insured and some
were not, and those whose stalls were not
covered are now expressing dissatisfac-
Hon. The warehouse was stored to its
full capacity of above 4500 tons w hen the
tire broke oat, and at $7 a ton its contents
were worth $31,500. The buihiine is
worth $*500, making the total loss $40,000.

Acrimonious Resolutions Regarding
Two Recent College
Articles.
BERKELEY, Cal., Oct. : 12.â An ex
traordinarily exciting meeting of the As
sociated Students at the State University
was he'd this afternoon. â '; The assemblage
gathered for the ~\ purpose, as stated by
President Elston, of appointing a man to
lead the yelling at the football games, but
before they got through they discussed
co-eds, politics, affiliated colleges, praised
The Call, passed a set of lengthy resolu
tions acrimoniously condemning the San
Francisco Examiner for "putting the uni
versity in a false light before the public."
A. H. Allen '98 spoke at some length,
in which he quoted the headlines of two
articles which have appeared ; in recent
issues of the Examiner relating to the ex
pulsion of the Bryan men from the Asso
ciated Students for condemning Yalt. and
the purported unfavorable attitude of the
college men toward the co-eds. He then
introduced - the 'â  resolutions, , which were
passed by a heavy vote.
J. W. Legg tt of the Bryan Clnb at the
university demanded i that the j; student
bo f iy condemn] the five juniors 'who, had
circulated the report that his club would
be expelled from the Associated Students
because they : . sent â a ; communication to
Bryan frowning on the recent action of the
Yale I men. i Cornwall '98 ; said i that the
"expulsion", 1 question was : all I a "josh."

waters. ;; _ â  â  â  â :. â¢'.*;.. * -"

SCHULLER SENTENCED.
The Stockbroker Goes to San Quentln
fur Five Years.
In expiation of nis crimes Norman
SchuUer, the whilom king of the cocktail
route, will spend , five years in the peni
tentiary at San Quentia. Judge Wallace
yesterday imposed that sentence on him,
he having pleaded guilty of forgery.
Schuller is the son of a respectable
couple, who reside in Oakland. He was
engaged in business as a stockbroker, but
became enamored of hard liquor and set
the pace that kills. In order to obtain
funds with which to continue his orgies,
having spent all, his own money, he re
sorted to tne scheme, of signing other
men's names to c mmercial paper which
he negotiated. In this manner he swin
dled a number of his friends out of several
thousand dollars.
, Yesterday, Schuller was very penitent.
His attorney first addressed the court and
told of now sorry his client is that it all
happened and of his determination to
lead a better life if riven a chance to re
deem himself." He closed by asking that
a light sentence be imposed. , '.â .::
In his own behalf Scbuller said that be
is not a criminal, but simply a vicuna of
the liquor habit, and that he is deter
mined to repay those' whom he swindled
when he is again a free man.
"I did not know what I was doing," said
he, "and â¢I ' deeply regret â â¢ my folly. I
promise that if I am given a ci.anco to do
so I will devote the remainder of my life
to the alleviation of the sorrows of those
to whom I have Drought disgrace."
After imposing sentence Judge Wallace
granted a stay of execution for four days.
The Moonlight In Port.
After an unsuccessful cruise of several
months along the coast of Mexico in search
of a lost guano island the schooner Moon
light abandoned her project and turned to
this port. She arrived last ev<. ing at S
o'clock in ballast and anchored in the stream.
It bas been calculated that on a steamer
like the Campania or E.ruria more than
3000 articles ot glass and China are broken
on cv ry voyage.

MONSTER PETITION
FOR S. D. WORDEN
Mighty Effort to Secure a
Commutation of His
Sentence.
Labor Unions of the State Secure
Over io,oco Names in a
Week.
ALL WORDEN'S JURORS SIGNED
Attorney Bush Dec'ares That the
Condemned Man Is Being "Rail*
roaded" to Death.
"Worden is innocent and he must not
bang." This is the verdict rendered by
the Labor Council of San Francisco, which
seems, to be seconded by all the labor
nnions throughout the State.
For just one week a petition to Governor
Budd asking that the executive clemency
be granted to the extent of commuting
the death penalty to life imprisonment
has been in circulation throughout the
State . from the snow-capped . Shasta
Mountain to the Mohave Desert. Yet
even now the list of signers has swelled to
10,000 names, and more petition blanks
are to be struck off at once. The first
number was 2500.
Tne matter was first taken up the 7th
of last August, when a special committee
was appointed to see what steps should be
taken for a commutation of Worden's sen
tence in the persons of W. Macarthur, T.
F. Burns. C. E. Hawkes, W. C. Ackerman,
Edward Rosenberg.
Decisive steps were not taken by the La
bor Council till the arrival of Worden's
brother, W. D. Worde:i, a missionary to
Japan. The latter has now been here
about a month. Attorney E. R. Bush of
'Woodland was then consulted and advised
that steps to the end in view be taken as
soon as practicable. Since the sending
out of the petitions orders for more blanks
have been pouring in upon the Labor
Council at a rapid rate, which makes it
necessary now to strike off many more.
The wording of the petition is very terse
and simple, and reads as follows:
In the matter of the application for com
mutation of sentence of S. D. Worden
from capital punishment to life imprison
ment.
To his Excellency, Hon. J. H. Budd,
Governor of the State of California:
We, the undersigned, respectfully peti
tion that the sentence of death now pro
nounced against 8. D. Worden be com
muted to imprisonment for life.
Conjointly with the sending out of the
petition blanks to the various labor unions
of the State the following letter of ex
planation was also forwarded:
San Francisco Labor Council, i
1159 Mission Street, S
. San Francisco, October 7, 1896. >
Fellov>-workcrt, Greeting: The SaD Francisco
Labor Council asks your co-operation in the
circulation of the petition to Governor Budd
for commutation of the sentence upon S. D.
Worden from capital punishment to life im
prisonment. The Labor Council during toe
last three months has carefully examinedthe
records of the Worden case, has conferred with '
men who took an active part in the A. R. U.
â trike at Sacramento and Has consulted several
leading attorneys.
We find that S. D. Worden, charged jointly
with five other railroad men with the murder
of S. A. Clark, engineer of the train wrecked
near Sacramento on July 11, 1894, had not
received a fair trial. Affidavits prove that
WorJen during his trial was mentally de
ranged and that his attorney pleaded for more
time, which, however, was denied him, as also
were the petitions for a new trial after sen
tence of death had been passed. Had Worden
been in a normal mental state he could not
hf.ve been convicted, for his co-defendants,
Applemau and Hatch, afterward tried on the
same charge, easily proved their innocence
and were duly acquitted.
Worden will be executed on December 18
unless the Governor grants a commutation of
sentence.
Believing, as we do, that Worden is inno
cent and should be liberated, but also know
ing the influences at work to prevent full
justice being done, the Labor Council is con
fining its efforts at present to securing a com
mutation of the sentence. , .
Every lover of justice and humanity, no mat
ter what bis station in life, should < sign this
petition and prevent a foul stain upon the
people of the State.
We have mailed you under separate cover a
number of petitions which we urge you to dis
tribute among the members of your union,
with the request to have them filled out by
their friends and acquaintances. When filled
out the petitions, signed -In your locality,
should bo returned to you. Should you re
quire additional petition blanks I will upon
notification forward same to you.
The petitions are intended to close on the
15th of November, upon which date you will
please return them to me.
Earnest and diligent effort is necessary to
save Worden, and the San Francisco Labor
Council urges you to give your assistance in
this grave matter, for should Worden be
executed corporate wealth will have estab
lished a precedent which it will only too
readily use against the workingman whenever
its nefarious ends can therefore be served.
Trusting in'your co-operation, I am,' yours for
justice and humanity, Ed Rosenberg,
Recording and Corresponding Secretary.
: Attorney Bush is now drawing up a full
legal petition to be presented :o the Gov
ernor at the same time the monster peti
tion of the labor unions is presented.
Among the points it will contain are the
following:
First, a full statement is made of the
murder and the trial of Worden for the
same, the decision of the Superior Court
of Yolo County, the appeal to the Supreme
Court and its decision upholding- that of
the lower court, and the fact that Worden
has been in solitary confinement sines
that time. .
Secondly, that nearly all the evidence
against Worden implicated also the other
defendants to the same extent, showing
that he could not have been the sole
perpetrator.
Thirdly, that none of the other de
fendants' trials were had until final sen
tence was passed on Worden and he was
relegated to solitary confinement, leaving
no opportunity for counsel to make use of
the testimony introduced at the others'
trials.
Fourthly, that the evidence introduced
mew TO-OAT.
Tace raw
AND
BLEEDING
My little boy was afflicted with Eczema la
acute form -for a year, during which we tried
without success every known remedy. The dis-
order appeared on the right cheek and was of a
blistery and bloody form. His pillow, mornings,
would bear the bloody imprint of the side of his
face, while it was impossible to prevent him
from scratching his face owing to the itching.
Advised to try Cutocuiu, I bought a box. The
first application was made at night, and It is a
fact, that the appearance of the affected part*
â¢ho wed a noticeable improvement the next morn-
ing, and, continuing the treatment, as a result,
my child has as fair and smooth skin as can be
found anywhere.

against Hatch and Appleman was practi
cally the same as that used against Wor
den and yet they were found not guilty.
Fifthly, that at the lime of his trial
Wonien was suffering both serious mental
and bodily derangement to such extent
that he could not suitably advi3e his at
torneys as regards the selection of proper
witnesses. In fact he is stated to have
been so nearly insane that a* fast as ev>
dence in his favor was adduced he would
give it to the prosecution without the
knowledge of his legal advisers.
Sixthly, that new and important evi
dence tending to clear Worden 'will be
given the Governor in due time and that
the appended pc ition will show that the
vast majority of intelligent men in this
State believe that Worden is being rail
roaded to his death in two senses of the
word.
Ed Rosenberg, the secretary of the San
Francisco Labor Council, stated yesterday
that every juror who had served at Wor
den's trial had already signed the petition,
and that the name of nearly every in
habitant of Woodland was also to be
found on the list
If the labor councils succeed in getting
Governor Budd to commute Worden's
sentence it is probable that they will then
engage actively in an endeavor to free
him.
FILED THEIR PETITIONS.
The Anti-Charter Democrat and Clti
iens' Independent Parties Want
a Place on the Ticket.
Two political parties that were obliged
by the laws governing the making up of
the official ballots to circulate petitions
asking that they be allowed a place on the
ballot filed their tickets with the neces
sary signatures yesterday.
The Buckley Democrats, who have
dubbed their faction of the party the
Anti-Charter Democrat party, sent in to
the Registrar a bundle of bulky petitions
containing 5435 names and asked that
they be received officially. Mr. Hinton
declined to take this course without an in
vestigation into the genuineness of the
signatures, and bis decision in the matter
will be withheld for a day.
The Citizens' Independent party also
filed their petition containing 2892 names
and promised to add another thousand
before to-morrow nieht, when all peti
tions must be in the Registrar's hands.
P. A. DOLAN'S TICKET, TOD.
Still Another Company of Local
Candidates for the Great
Regiment.
Dolan Bolts o'Donnell and Gets Up
His Own Little Political
Party as Usual.
P. A. Dolan's municipal ticket is about
to be dumped into the mess of woes in
flicted on the San Francisco voters this
year. Mr. Dolan is adding another com-
P. A. DOLAN, the Political Freak Who Always Plumps a Little
Ticket Into the Campaign.
pany to the great regiment of municipal
candidates.
Dolan is a political character who, like
O'Donneli, is always in the field. He is
an illustration of how easy it is to get up
a little political party, endow it with a
name, write a platform to fit, charge for
seats on the ticket and make a little more
trouble in the political pool.
Dolan has bolted O'Donneli this year
for the first time, and he and his associ
ates are now gradually building the "Free

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 13, 1896.
LIQUOR INTERESTS
NOW IN POLITICS
Seven Powerful Associa
tions Are in the
Campaign.
They Will Hold a Municipal
Convention a Week From
Thursday.
TO INDORSE THEIR TICKET.
Only Candidates Known to Be Liberal
Toward the Trade Will Be
Ctosen.
The liquor interests|are not to be neg
lected in the coming election in San
Francisco. On the contrary, it is intended
that they shall cut a very important figure
in the struggle, for there will be a ticket â
selected, of course, from the various tick
ets now in the field â as representative of
those interests. The men in charge of the
liquor-dealers' campaign have so far kept
their work secret, so much so, indeed, that
people interested in politics have quite
forgotten that one very influential factor
was in existence.
Subsequent developments since the cam
paign actually opened have proved that it
is a mistake to forget the liquor men.
The truth is the various trade associations
connected with this business have been
doing very efficient work among them
selves tor weeks past in a political way.
They have held secret meetings and ap
pointed committees from their respective
bodies and these committees in turn have
come together to consider the situation.
Every other day private gatherings in
central places have been held, usually in
the afternoons, but so well was the work
kept dark it never leaked out that a pow
erful body was making careful prepara
tions for its own campaign.
There were some differences at the out
set, particularly was there one between
the wholesalers and retailers regarding
the advisability of mixing San Francisco
municipal affairs with those ot other cities
in California, but this was quickly settled
by all parties agreeing to go into the local
fight without incumbrances resulting fr. m
outside influences. A lead in _' member of
one of the associations said yesterday that
this evidence of harmony is sufficient in
itself to show that nothing can be let
stand |in the way of accomplishing de
sired ends.
At the last meeting of the committees
representing the allied societies it was
unanimously agreed that a municipal con
vention be held a week from next Thurs
day at a hall to be selected in a day or
two.
The committees aid much more busi
ness at the same session. They arranged
for the appointment or election of dele
gates from seven trade associations to
this convention, and the result is there
will be an important gathering of the
California State Protective Association,
which is composed of the wholesale liquor
dealers; the Retail Liquor-dealers' Asso
ciation, made up of the best element of
saloon men in town; the League of Free
dom, representing the wine-dealers; the
Retail Grocers' Protective Association;
the Brewers' Protective Association, com
posed of brewery proprietors; the Ger
man Grocers' Association and the Gro
cers' Union.
Already committees from these bodies
have been appointed for the purpose of
investigating the legislative, judicial and
municipal nominees, and they are quietly
though effectually going over the ground
assigned to each one.
It is their purpose to select satisfactory
candidates witti a view to indorsement at
the convention. Their names, however,
are not to be known outside the commit
tee-room, and consequently anybody look
ing for support or favor for any particular
candidate may not look for satisfaction
through "doing politics." This means
that, "the push" must stand aside, and
that the selections will be influenced solely
by the judgment of the committees, or
the convention, as far as it is guided by
the conviction upon the nominees' weli
known attitude toward the interests in
volved.
"We shall name good broad-minded
people," explained an officer ot the Pro
tective Association, "men who will not
jeopardize our interests. But not tem
perance men, or those who might op
pose us.
"The whole matter rests with the Board
of Supervisors, so far as we are directly
concerned in this fight The Supervisors
make the laws, wiiicti we must abide by,
so we look to them more than to any other
men on the ticket. To be sure we cannot
neglect the legislative ticket, for much de
pends on those nominees. It is simply
this: Onr associations do not want to have
people that would make things disagree
able for us. Our interests are very laree,
and we have legal rights, which we pro
pose to see reÂ«pected."
Sued for an accounting.
Will E. Fisher & c o . to Render a State
ment to the Fair Estate.
The special administrator of the will of
James G. Fair yesterday filed a suit
against Will E. Fisher and Henry A.
Smith, members of the firm of Will E.
Fisher & Company, asking that the Su
perior Court order the defendants to ac
count to them for the sales of the Cort
land avenue and Mission-street property,
belonging to the Fair estate, which was in
1893 placed in their hands for disposal.
It is claimed by the executors that, al
though the agreement under which the
real estate firm was given charge cf the
property provides that they shall make an
accounting on the sth and 20th of each
month, Senator Fair, in his lifetime,
found it extremely difficult to procure a
statement once in several months, and
that since his death they have been ren
dered even more irregularly than before.
This particular matter was in the hands
of Administrator Bresse, who died several
.months ago, since which time, it is al
leged, no accounting at all has been made.
Henry A. Smith is no longer a partner
in the firm of Will E. Fisher & Co., and he
some time ago filed a petition in insol
vency.
ROBBED A SALOON.
George O'Connor, One of a Trio, Placed
Under Arrest.
George O'Connor, 19 years of age and a
molder by trade, was booked at the City
Prison last night on the charge of grand
larceny by Policemen Ryan and O'Dea.
Last Saturday afternoon two young men
entered Daly's saloon, 545 Mission street,
while Daly was in a room in the rear for a
few minutes, and stole a gold watch and
chain, some whisky and cigars. O'Connor
stood outside and the other two passed
the stolen articles to him.
Daly observed them and O'Connor ran.
Daly gave chase and O'Connor dropped
the watch and chain, but stuck to the
whisky and cigars. He was arrested on
EcKer street last night by Ryan and
O'Dea.
ASCENDED THE YUKON,
Louis Sloss Jr. Returns From
a Trip to the Far
North
Alaska Is Destined to Become
a Famous Mining
Region.
Louis Sloss Jr., who went to Alaska last
April on a tour of inspection for the
Alaska Commercial Company, returned
yesterday, arriving on tlie Bertha nine
days from TJnga. He was accompanied
by Rudolph Neuman and Charles L. Hall.
Mr. Sloss made an extensive trip, visit
ing all the important stations of the com
pany. He ascended the Yukon River on
one of the company's large steamers last
August. The highest point he reached
was Forty Mile Camp on Canadian soil.
Circle City, an important point on Ameri
can territory, is 240 miles below Forty
Mile. The Yukon is annually replenisnea
by melting snows and the season of high
water on the lower river is midsummer.
The navigation to Forty Mile, a point
1800 miles from the nioutii of the river, is
not at all difficult. The current in some
places is swift, but there are no rapids or
falls to obstruct boats. Steamers go far
above Forty Mile.
Mr. Sioss is of the opinion that Alaska
is destined to be a great mining country.
Intact, it is already an important mining
region. The prospectors are constantly
reporting new discoveries. The mines ad
jacent to Circle City and Forty Mile are
not overcrowded with miners and no dis
tress is reported from these localities. It
is thought that too many miners went to
Cooks Inlet.
Placer mining in the region of Circle
City is now profitably conducted and some
discoveries of rich quartz have been re
ported.
Seal catching in Alaskan waters is said
to be conducted under the regulations for
the protection of the industry.
At Sitka Mr. Sloss met United States
Commissioner Robert C. Rogers, who is
well known in San Francis -o.
Charles L. Hall, who came from St.
Michaels on the Bertha, has been in Alas
ka for two and a half years. He is a
brother of George Hall, the Turkish Con
sul in San Francisco. Mr. Hall went to
Alaska a short time before his mother
came to this City. He saw her yesterday
lor the first time in eleven years. She was
not apprised of his coming, so the de
light of meeting her son was unexpected.
NO RECORDS WERE MADE
A Clerical Error Changed the
Times of Sunday's Road
Race.
Lind, Williamson, Ben Noonan and
Shearman Won the Time
Prizes.
Chairman Stratton of the road-racing
board of the associated cycling clubs yes
terday discovered a glaring discrepancy in
the time-table of the big ten-mile race
held on the San Leandro road Sunday,
whereby the time of the men who rode
from the scratch-mark was made a minute
and ten seconds faster than it should have
been. It was clearly an error in computa
tion, but the corrected figures give the
credit for the best time performances to
four entirely different men, and the
scratch men are minus their glory and
their prizes in cousequence.
The mistake made was a peculiar one.
The scratch men started at 11 :10 a. m. and
finished a few seconds apart at 11:35:30.
In making the deduction the clerks, in
their hurry and excitement, subtracted
11:10 from 35:30, making the fastest time
24:20. They should have taken the figures
11:10:00 from 11:35:30. making Squires'
time 25:30 and the other scratch men,
Kenna, Noonan, Yeoman and Kraft, ac
cordingly.
When these corrections were made in
the record table it was found that the men
who rode froÂ»n the 1 mm. and 45 sec.
marks had made the best time and were
entitled to the time prizes, as follows: I.
R. Lin. l, Imperial, 24:58; J. C. William
son, Santa Rosa. '.'4:58 4-5; Ben Noonan,
Santa Rosa, 24:59; R. R. Shearman, Gar
den City, 25.
These facts were presented to the various
officials of tht- race yesterday and they all
reai.ily recognized the mistake made and
signed the corrected table, and the prizes
will be distributed accordingly.
The changes do not affect the award of
the Olympic trophy, the Acme Club win
ning it with ten points, Imperials five,
San Francisco Road Club five and Santa
Rosas four.
Under the new table, however, the coast
record for ten miles was not lowered in
Sunday's race, as 24:58 was the best time
made, and the record stands at 24:27.
J. C. Near of Santa Ro3a dio not break
his leg in the race, as stated in a morning
paper. He only suffered a slight abrasion
on the left le^ and hip, and was Strolling
about the City yester.lay very much un
concerned for a man who was said to have
broken a limb.
TWO OLD BANKS
IN LIQUIDATION
Affairs of Masonic Savings
and Loan Association
Wound Up.
Depositors Have Lost Only Three
and Sixty-Nine-One-Hun
dredths Per Cent
THE ODD FELLOWS' BAKE.
Directors Notified to Wind Up the
Business in .Eight Months.
Big Deficit.
The affairs of the Masonic Bank, which
had been in liquidation for a number of
years, have been wound up, the depositors
have been paid 96 31 per cent, and now
nothing remains for the directors to do
but to disincorporate.
This bank was incorporated as a com
mercial and savings bank on the 14th of
November, 1869, and commenced business
on the 9th of February following, and the
following-named, all members of the
Masonic fraternity, composed the board of
directors: L. E. Pratt, M. R. Roberts, C.
S. Hobbs, C. H. Wetherbee, Hiram Rose
krans, George Robins, Frank Smith, W.
H. Culver, J. F. Snow; Hiram T. Graves,
J. Kittridge, W. T. Garratt and Frank
Eastman, of which L. E. Pratt was presi
dent. George Robins was the cashier.
The amount of capital stock was $150,000,
which was fully paid up.
The bank was doing considerable busi
ness and was supposed to be on the high
road to prosperity, when suddenly on the
20th of August, 1878, the first Board of
Bank Commissioners that had been in
vestigating its affairs gave notice that it
must cease doing business, assigning as a
reason that the bank had been making
loans on security that aid not represent
the amount of the loans. The directors
asked for time, asserting that they would
in a very short time be able to meet the
deficiency. The reply of the commission
ers was that the bank might remain open,
but that it must not receive any more de
posits. The commissioners, on the day
they received notice, decided to go into
liquidation, and the doors were closed.
This occasioned considerable excitement
at that time. Since then the directors
realized on the assets to meet the obliga
tions amounting to $1,084,000 due deposit
ors, with the result that the loss they sus
tained is but 3.69 per cent.
Of the original directors Pratt, Hobbs,
Wetherbee, Rosekrans, Kittridge, Gar
ratt and E'-istman are dead.
"The directors of the Odd Fellows' Sav
ings Bank have to close up their affairs in
eight months," said C. H. Dunsmore,
secretary of the State Bank Commission.
Trat bank, of which H. B. Brooks was
president and James Benson secretary,
commenced business on the Ist of Decem
ber, 1866, originally as a mutual bank, but
on the 24ih of June it was reorganized
under the provisions of section 300 of the
Civil Code, with a capital stock of $250,
--000. On account of trouble about loans
the bank went into liquidation February
5, 1879, owing depositors, including the
amount due other banks, $2,117,120 71.
Since then sixteen dividends, amounting
in the aggregate to $1,829,801 92, or 87>Â£
per cent, have been declared. Of this
amount the sum of $22,678 70 in dividends
h ad not been called for on the 31st of last
July.
Tnere is now due depositors $264,640,
and other liabilities amount to $2943 59,
making $267,583 59. To this must be added
the capital paid in coin, $128,975, and
the $22,678 70 unpaid dividends, which
make the total liabilities $419,237 38.
The resources are: Real estate in San
Francisco, valued at $7002 70; real estate
in Sutter County (under water), valued at
$48,636 70; money on hand, $338 38; due
from banks and bankers, $46, 202 01; fur
niture estimated at $540 75, and other
assets, $18 47; total $102,739 01, with which
to meet a deticit of $316,498 37. The assets,
it is thought, will not realize the amount
stated, for the reason the land in Sutter
will not bring the sum named. The next
dividend will be a very small one.
EMBEZZLEMENT CHARGED.
Case Against Adolph Broiling Dis
missed, but He Was Again Arrested.
Adolph Bruning appeared before Judge
Campbell yesterday to answer a charge of
misdemeanor embezzlement preferred by
A. F. Busse, bookkeeper for A. Repsold &
Co., liquor merchants, 517 California
street. After bearing the evidence the
case was dismissed.
Busse immediately swore to another
complaint and last night Bruning, who
lives in Oakland, was arrested and brought
to the City Prison, where he was booked.
Bruning said last night that his arrest
again looked like persecution. He was at
one time collector for Repsold & Co., and
in February last a deficiency in his ac
counts was discovered amounting to about
$500. He agreed to pay the amount and
gave them $100 cash and notes for the
balance. It was understood that if any
other amount should crop up they were to
notify him and he would arrange to
settle it
Nominees Withdraw.
The managers of the Populist party notified
the Registrar yesterday that C. D. Cleveland,
the Populist nominee for Supervisor in the
Eighth Ward, had withdrawn in favor of
FratiK Mailoy, the Democratic nominee, and
that Terrence O'Brien, the Supervisorial nomi
nee lrom the Ninth Ward, had withdrawn in
favor of H. B. Goecken.

KINNEY'S DEATH.
i
1 The Police Have Come to the Conclu
sion That Hi* Drowning Was
Accidental.
The investigation by Detectives Cody
and Crockett into the drowning of A. J.
Kinney, the hackman, was finished yester
day morning, and they have reported to
Captain .bees that all the facts lead to the
conclusion that it was accidental.
It was shown that Kinney was consider
ably under the influence of liquor Satur
day night. Frank Corbett says that he
was "greatly under the influence," so
much so that when leaving his undertak
ing parlors be carried away the curtain of
the tront door.
J. M. Ferris, who was the last person
that saw Kinney alive, says he -was "full
up to the neck.'"' After he and Kinney left
Corbett's parlors they walked down Mar
ket street to Eighth, down Eighth to
Natoma, where Kinney left him and went
into No. 716, occupied by Mrs. Lynch.
Kinney stayed there about ten minutes.
After he came out he and Ferris walked to
Third and Howard street?, where they
parted. This was about 11:30 p. H.
Detective Cody says he learned that Kin
ney wanted to go back to Mrs. Lynch, who
is divorced from her husband, and while
carrying out that intention he got turned
around and waited east, instead of west,
until he got to the wharf.
Sent to Preston.
George Green and Thomas Kelly, two Los
Angeles lads, aged respectively 17 and 16,
were yesterday committed to the Preston In
dustrial School at lone by Judge Wallace.
The boys from the citrus belt pleaded guilty
of burglary in the first degree. They were
caught in the attempt to rob a house on Bush
street, but a crook, whom they allege induced
them to commU the crime, escaped. On a
statement of the facts by the prisoners' attor
ney, supplemented by the request of Assistant
District Attorney Biack, his Honor decided
not to send the boys to the penitentiary, and
so sentenced them to Preston until they have
attained their majority.
CORBETT MUST FIGHT,
National Club Will Make One
More Offer to the Alleged
Champion.
Sharkey Says He Will Slap Jim's
Pretty Face Wherever He
Meets Him.
Manager Groom of the National Athletic
Club drew down yesterday the $5000 he
had on deposit for a ten-round contest
between Tom Sharkey and James Corbett.
He said that the letter which Corbett
wrote, iii answer to a dispatch he received
after the money was deposited, was suffi
cient to establish in his mind the fact that
James J. does not intend to fight Sharkey.
"I do not propose, however," said
Groom, "to let this matter rest, because,
in all justice to Sharkey, who has com
plied with the conditions that have been
exacted by the National Club, the
championship of the world must be wrested
from the man who now wrongfully lays
claim to it. Corbett must either fight or
acknowledge to the sporting world that he
is no longer physically able to defend the
title.
"After Sharkey gave him an unlooked
for surprise in the Pavilion he imme
diately challenged the sailor to a finish
fight and artic.es of agreement to that
effect were drawn up and signed by the
pugilists. When Sharkey and Corbett
met in New York in the office of a sport
ing paper Corbett said in the presence of
several witnesses that he was booked to
fight Sbarkey to a finish within six months
from the time of signing articles before
the club that would give the best financial
inducements.
"Well, I now propose to test Mr. Cor
bett's sincerity and will deposit a sub
stantial forfeit in the keeping of any re
sponsible person or firm as a guarantee on
the part of the National Club to carry out
the conditions of the articles of agreement,
which were signed by him in this City
prior to his departure lor the East. The
National Club will guarantee Mr. Corbett
a suitable place, where be can decide with
Mr. Sharkey in a contest to a finish which
of the two pugilists is entitled to the belt
and the heavy-weight championship."
Dan Lynch, the manager and backer of
Sharkey, said that he was not at all sur
prised when he read Corbett's answer.
"I knew that the coward and blowbard
was afraid of Tom, and he now takes on
Fitzsimmons for another wilduoose chase
through Mexico and Arizona. Coroett
has no idea of fighting Fitzsimmons or
any other man. His cards are played and
his constitution has been completely
wrecked. He knows that he is a dead dog
in the pit, and why don't he come out like
a man and say so?
"Fitzsimmons knows as well as I do
that Corbett is physically disabled and
can no longer do any fighting. The pair
may keep on shooting paper-wads at each
other for some months, but the sporting
people of the East will soon grow tired of
chin music and compel the two bluffers to
get in and fight or get off the earth.
"Sharkey is the only man among them
who means business, and if Mr. Corbett
will reluse to meet him in a finish fight an
offer will be made to Fitzsimmons. It is
nearly time that the public stopped
patronizing those hippodrome figbters
whose best work is on the stage, where
they meet in friendly tapping bouts; but
I think Corbett could beat Sharltey at this
game. Anyhow, I will not challenge him
to such a contest, as I am afraid that he
would cover my money too quickly."
Sharkey is wild at Corbett and threatens
to leave here on Saturday with the avowed
object of slapping Corbett's pretty face at
first meeting.
