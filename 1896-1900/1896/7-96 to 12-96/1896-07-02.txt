Chicago, 111., July 1.)
Governor Johann Proudhon Altgeld
has mounted the Democracy, and is jab
bing his brass spurs into the quivering
sides of the superannuated steed. Thus
far he is the boss of the National Democ
racy. He and Governor Stone of MU
muri were log-rolling for Bland to-day.
The tarriff will not be an issue â with
the Democracy at this campaign. It
trill be dropped and the fight will be
made on silver as the only and all im
portant plank. Senator â  Cockrell of
Missouri told me to-day that he did not
know whether a tariff-for-revenue-only
plank would be put into the platform at
all, but he thought that the Democracy
might shed a few tears through the
cracks In the platform for the poor
Cubans. He added that the tariff ques
tion had been settled for the next four
years, by which he meant that the De
mocracy -would win on free coinage, and
that the 'Wilson bill would remain in
operation for that period. X.eai.ing
Democrats decline to discuss the tariff
proposition, and when tapped a' stream
of silver issues from their lips.

It looks now as though nothing: would
beat Bland for the nomination. He goes
into Chicago as McKlnley went into St.

Vice-President Stevenson arrived to
day, and admitted that he was a candi

IGNORING THE TARIFF.
Democrats Build Their Hope of
Success Upon the White
Metal Issue.
CHICAGO. 111., July I.â Johann Proud
hon Altgeid, booted and with spurs of
brass, has mounted the steed of Democracy,
and the crack of his whip can now be
heard in every State in the Union, as he
jabs the brass points into the quivering
flesh of his tired and superannuated steed.
As he ran the State Convention to suit
himself, so he is running the National
Democratic Convention, and no one thus
far among the leaders of the party has had
the courage to say him nay. He has been
jobbing around all day with Governor
Stone of Missouri, rounding up a delegate
here, lassoing another delegate there, and
driving other delegates into the corner of
the corral in order that the redhot brand
ing-iron of Altgeld shall ornament their
hides. He is making a tight in the inter
est of Dick Bland for President, and has
thereby gained the confidence and sup
port of the Missouri delegation and of the
HOW THE DEMOCRATIC DELEGATES LEF/ CAKLAND FOR CHICAGO YESTERDAY.
The San Francisco Call
Governor of that Btate for the furtherance
of his own ambitious designs.
No one has yet come to the front to dis
pute the supremacy in Democratic coun
cils of this colleague of Herr Most, this
pardoner of bomb-throwing anarchists.
When one looks deeper into the matter he
will see that under present conditions
there is no reason why any good Demo
crat should dispute the claims of Johann
Proudhon Altgeld to act as the drum
major for this brass band of Democratic
office-seefcers. Altgeld is satisfactory be
cause he can do the business, the aforesaid
business being the capture of the Federal
offices by the Democratic office brlpade,
and that,is sufficient. That is the Lake of
Como which delights them in their politi
cal dreams, and they cannot see that it is
beneatli the dignity of the Governor of the
State of Missouri and the Justice of a State
Supreme Court to logroll in the interests
of certain candidates when the Governor
of the great State of Illinois, which gave
to the Nation an Abraham Lincoln, is do
ing the same thing.
For about the first time in its history,
the National Democratic party stands
without a principle. The tariff for revenue
only was the corner post of all of its plat
forms, but now that important issue is to
be consigned to the political junk shop.
and the battle for office is to be made upon
the silver issue, whic^, until now, had not
been recognized as a principle of the Demo
cratic party. That principle has been
taken up simply for the purpose of obtain
ing the votes of the silver States and of
the adherents of silver coinage throughout
the rest of the Union. The tariff issue, i
which has been the prominent battle cry
of the Democracy, and which has oeen the
watchword of the Republican party
I through all the campaigns in the past, will
| not be heard from the ranks of the Democ
! racy thi3 year.
The Republicans will discuss this ques
i tion during the campaign, and will to the
: end uphold the banner of protection to
American industries, whether victorious
!or defeated. A principle which cannot
survive defeat in one or two or a dozen
i campaigns and a party which will aban
i Jon principle merely because of defeat, are
both unworthy of the respect of all good
citizens. The Democratic party to-day
stands in this attitude. It has made an
alliance with the silver men of the West
and South simply for the sake of getting
into power, and has abandoned all ttie old
principles with which its silver-tongued
colonels were wont to make the welkin
ring.
Such of the leaders as are here to-day
make no denial of the fact tnat the battle
will be made on the silver plank, and that
the tariff proposition whicli so vitally af
fects the welfare of the laboring men and
women of this Nation must wait for an
other four years. You cannot get a Dem
ocrat here to talic with you on tne tariff.
If you ask him for his opinion upon any
political subject a stream of silver forth
with issues from his lips and will not be
dammed unless you spell it with an "n."
Senator Cockrell of Missouri, who is j
one of the big guns of the convention here,
to-day gave me the keynote to the tune
which the Democracy is goinc to sing in |
the fall. The Senator iÂ« an elderly per- ;
sonage of large frame, witn a massive
head, a benevolent, fatherly face, a gray
chin whisker and a suit of sober black. He
might be mistaken for a farmer who had
waxed wealthy in the production of corn
and potatoes, or he might pass for a coun
try judge learned in the law. When I
asked him to-day for an interview he be
gan to squirm. Ue was awfully busy talk
ing politics with Tom, Dick and Harry,
and had on the day before talked a whole
river of silver into the ear of a reporter j
for one of the New York papers. A look
of anguish passed over his features when
I informed him that it was not my pur
pose to question him concerning his opin
ions upon the silver issue, because that |
matter and the complexion of the conven- I
tion with regard to it had been already {
exploited, and that there was no more of
news to be had on that subject. Then I
asked him whether the Democracy was to
have a strong plank in the platform re
affirming the devotion of the party to the
time-honored principle of a tariff for reve
nue only. The Senator answered as i had
expected he would.
"There is only one issue before the peo
ple," he said, "and that is the free coinage
of silver. The tariff question has been
practically settled for the next four years."
SAN FRANCISCO, THURSDAY MORNING, JULY 2, 1896.
THE NEW BOSS OF THE DEMOCRACY READY TO ROUND UP DELEGATES.
He proceeded to lay bow tl* people of \
;I â â â  iJaÂ£f we;e Tor silver and Low the gold
men of the East were quaking in their
boots at the prospect of Democratic suc
cess. So far as the chances of the candi
dates for the Presidency were concerned
he was of the opinion that Mr. Bland was
in the lead, but with a conservatism most
remarkable in a Missouri Democrat he
added that he could not be sure of that
fact, because all the delegates had not yet
arrived and had not been canvassed with
reference to their preferences for the Presi
dency.
With reference to the platform to be
adopted by the convention the Senator
gave his opinior. mat it would be short
and sweet. He did not think that there
would be much in it concerning the issue
of the tariff. He was rather of the opin
ion that what there would be of the plat
| form would be streaked with silver and
that almost every plank in the important
manifesto would bear or carrom upon the
free-coinage proposition. The Senator
was more pleased when 1 asked whether
i there would be a plank expressing sympa
thy for tne Cuban revolutionists, and he
replied that, in his judgment, the plat
form might have something in it about
the Cuban and other things. "But," he
added, "it will all be directed toward the
silver issue." He did not know whether
the tariff would be mentioned at all.
That is all the Senator will say on the
political situation, outside of silver. He
would talk all day and late into the next
morning on that pleasant theme, which
sounds so mellifluonsly in Democratic
ears iust at this time; but on the matter
which concerns the vital interests of the
\ wool, Sti wine and Ufruii ryo- i
ducers of California .wi'l Â« :her States, lie 1
was as dumb as a boiled oyster. That's
the case witn all of them now â not the
oysters, but the Democratic leaders here.
They are like the policeman with the sil
ver dollar over his eye; they can't see any
thing else but the silver.
I could not help thinking how very
Democratic the Senator was when he ex
pressed his approval of a plank sympa
thizing with the revolutionists in Cuba,
while at the same time he had not a tear to
spare or a word of sympathy to bestow
upon the starving men, women and chil
dren in the great cities of the United
Statqp who are unable to buy bread be
cause the Democratic system of tariff, as
exemplified in the Wilson bill, has pre
vented them from obtaining employment
for any wages at all ; whereas, under the
beneficent workings of the Republican sys
tem of protection, there would be plenty
of work for them at fair wages.
But a Democratic National Convention
is not the place to speak of starving peo
ple. There is too much else that needs
attention. There are candidates to be
nominated; there are combinations to be
made whereby the party may be enabled
to take possession of the offices of the
country, and with them to reward her
faithful sons. How can we Democrats
here pay any attention to ruined wool and
fruit raisers when we are going. to have
here next. Monday 6000 or 6000 uniformed
Biand Leaguers, with a dozen or two brass
bands playing "Dixie," the "Star-span
gled Banner," "America" and "McGinty"?
How can we pay any attention to thu
barefooted and barelegged boys and girls
and women in mhny of our large cities,
when on next Sunday between fifteen
and twenty special trains filled with men
wearing Bland 's uniform will leave Mis
souri, shouting, singing and cheering all
the way to Chicago, to give us an object
lesson on the fact that Bland and silver
ere the only issues worthy of considera
tion by the Democratic National Conven
tion ? How can we find time to think
about depression in business, of the falling
off in the money received for exports, of
the tens of thousands of men and women
tramping the inhospitable sidewalks of
the big cities or skulking along the hedges
on the county roads when the Flambeau
Club from Topeka, Kans., armed with coal
oil torches, is coming herein three special
trains to set the streets on fire for "Silver
DicK"?
O. W. Powers, a delegate from Utah, is
another silver enthusiast. He told me
to-day that Colonel Isaac Trumbo made a
serious mistaKa when he neglected the
opportunity of walking out of the Repub
lican National Convention in St. Louis
when Teller, Cannon and the rest bolted
the Republican party.
"Ah ! that was a serious mistake," added
Mr. Powers, very regretfully. "If he had
done it his people would have stood by
him to the last, but his action in remain
ing a member of the Republican party has
cast distrust and suspicion upon his mo
tives. He is a splendid rustler and we had
always thought him to be sincere in his
work, but â " and here Delegate Powers
shook his head in a very melancholy
manner.
The first sign of animation in things
political observable to-day was the still
hunt from hotel to hotel and from room to
room by Governor Altgeld of Illinois and
Governor Stone of Missouri. The second
was a conference between two representa
tives of the two opposing factions, and tne
third was the formation of n crowd of men
in the lobby of the Palmer House, listen
ing to a heated and unmannerly discussion
on the subject of finance by two men, who
appeared to know as much about the sub
ject as the little, pinch-faced, stunted 10
-year-old girls wlio are wearing their lives
away in the big department stores of Chi
cago.
"Suppose," said one, "you had $2500 in
the bank in gold?"
"Well," interrupted the other, with a
gratified smile, "we'll suppose it. of
course."
The crowd laughed derisively and the
first speaker continued: "Suppose you
went to draw that money out and sup
pose they wanted to pay you in sil â "
"And the bank busted," remarked the
man who was supposed to have but $2500
in the bank. The crowd laughed again,
while the first speaker, very angry and
very much in earnest, resumed the suppo
sition and the crowd grew so big that the
pale-faced, sweltering women passing by
the hotel entrance, stopped to look in.
They thought it was a murder. That was
the last I heard of the discussion.

EXIT THE GOLD MEN.
Several Members of the National
Committee Scheduled for
a Knifing.
CHICAGO, 111., July I.â There was an
attendance of thirty-five representative
silver delegations at the adjourned meet
ing at the Sherman House to-night of the
National Bimetallic Committee. Senator
Jones of Arkansas, on behalf of the com
mittee delegated to wait on the members
of the National Committee, reported the
result of the conference. The Senator said
they had been received courteously and
had been informed that as the body they
appeared before was only a part of the
executive committee none of the questions
presented as to .temporary organization
and contesting delegations could be passed
on. The committee was requested to wait
upon the full committee.
After numerous speeches, moderate in
tone but bristling with a quiet determina
tion to have their own way in spite of a
National Committee of opposite monetary
faith and purpose, the committee decided
to continue the existence of the conference
committee, with Senator Jones as chair
man.
Several of the leaders spoke in favor of
enlarging the scope and usefulness of the
whole committee by making it a perma
nent convention organization, with the
title of caucus, to which all silver dele
gates will be eligible to come. This propo
sition met with unanimous favor, and
Senator Harris of Tennessee was chosen
chairman of the committee. The meeting
adjourned to Friday night or earlier at the
call of the chairman.
Among the newly arrived silver dele
gates who attended the meeting were ex-
Senator Patrick Walsh of Augusta and
Evan P. Howell of Atlanta, both of whom
are delegates at large from their State.
The Boies and Bland representatives from
lowa and Missouri, who are delegates, also
attended.
Governor Altgeld, who has been a tire
less and conspicuous worker in the silver
cause since the delegates began to arrive,
felt physically unequal to the task of keep
ing up the work, with next week's pro
gramme in prospect, and left for his offi
cial home in Springfield to-night. He will
return Sunday to renew the battle.
Immediately after the meeting Senator
CocKrell of Missouri was brought to his
room and introduced by Senator Jones.
The Governor appeared glad to meet the
Missouri Senator and the three went into
conference behind double-locked doors.
The Bland campaign managers, who were
waiting in the rotunda for something/
talked a3 though it was a certainty that
the forty-eight Illinois votes would be
case for Mr. Bland on the tirst ballot.
They accepted the conference with Sena
tor Cockrell as a favorable sign. There
has been no sign o! a Boies representa
tive being closeted with Governor Altgeld
in his private room.
Among the gold members of the Na
tional Committee who are being talked
about in a way which indicates their re
tirement in favor of the ruling element
are Messrs. Cable of Illinois, Sheerin of
Indiana, Prather of Missouri and Richard
son of lowa.
Senator Benjamin F. Tillman of South
Carolina, who is a delegate at large, ar
rived this evening with D. H. Tompkins
of the same State and registered at the
Sherman House. The fighting statesman
announced his intention of entering into
the thick of the tight to smother the gold
men in the convention at every stage, but
did not commit himself as to the candi
date of his choice.
Boles Is Reticent.
WATERLOO, lowa, July I.â Governor
Boies' attention was called this evening to
HARRIET BEECHER STOWE, AUTHOR OF "UNCLE TOM'S
CABIN," WHO DIED YESTERDAY.
the report that Governor Altgeld and Gov
ernor Stone had been in consultation
relative to casting the Illinois vote in the
National Convention for Bland. He ex
pressed some surprise at the report, but
said he knew nothing about it. It might
be true, but he had received no informa
tion on the subject. He did not care to
talk about the situation and did not say
what, in his opinion, would be the effect
of such combination.
Governor Boies says he is in receipt of
letters from every State in the Union in
dorsing his position on the silver question.
The letters from the Eastern States refer
principally to silver, while those from the
South and West nearly all contain refer
ence to his candidacy.

Taubeneck Says They'll Meet

no Farther.
UTTEES A TIMELY WARNING
TO DELEGATES.
The Chicago Nominee Must Be a Man
on Whom Silver Forces Can
Unite.
BT. LOUIS, Mo., July Lâ Chairman
Taubeneck of the People's Party National
Committee, when seen this morning re
garding a published statement that Mr.
Bland would be acceptable to the Populists
if the Democrats nominated him for Presi
dent at Chicago, said to a United Press
representative:
"I made no such statement, nor will the
People's party indorse Mr. Bland if he is
nominated at the Chicago Convention.
The People's party has more voters who
will stand up and be counted for free
silver than any other party in existence.
The People's party is the only party which
has honestly contended for the remonetiz
ation of silver at 16 to 1, and it is the only
party in existence whose members are
united for this demand. The People's
party, for the sake of a union of all the
silver forces at the polls in the coming
campaign, will meet other .silver elements
half way, but no farther will we surrender
our organization or individuality.
"If the Democrats cannot meet us half
way on a man like Senator Teller, then
that party is responsible for a division of
the silver forces in the coming campaign."

CHICAGO,ILL.,JuIy Lâ Dr. H. S. Taylor,
the Populist leader of Chicago and the
Illinois National Comiuitteeman, made the
declaration to-day that the National Con*
vention of his party in St. Louis would
under no consideration indorse Biand,
Boies, or any other Democrat for President.
"We will keep in th 6 middle of the road
in naming our candidate," he said. "Any
man the Democrats may name, who has
always belonged to tnat party, will not be
supported by us. Teller is the only man
we will indorse. In the Western States
there is no Democratic party now."
Clough for Governor.
ST. PAUL, Minx., July I.â The friends
of David M. Clough had everything their
own way in to-day's Republican State
Convention. The platform indorses that
adopted at St. Louis, recognizes the rights
of the laboring man, expresses itself in
favor of good roads and favors the taxa
tion of unused railroad lands.
David M. Clough was nominated for
Governor; John L. Gibbs, Lieutenant-
Governor, and Albert Berg, Secretary of
State; Andrew T. Koerner, Treasurer, and

WHITE AND FOOTE ALARMED.
Engaged in a Mighty Struggle to
Keep Their Following ia
Line.
SACRAMENTO, Cal.. July I.â The
California delegation to the Chicago Con
vention reached Sacramento with a big
split in its silver-unit rule, and with
Hon. W. W. Foote Takes a Pleasant
View ot the Sitnation
Various cracks and flaws radiating in dif
ferent directions.
Harry E. Wise, secretary of th*Â» delega
tion and one of the delegates from the
Fifth District, boldly jumped the silver
traces before the lights of Suisnn had been
left behind. He declared to The Call
representative thtt he was not going to
Cnicaeo to follow any political fantasies
nor to support any platform plank that
carried any suggestion of Populism or
anarchism.
Up to 10 o'clock to-night none other of
the poldbugs in tne delegation had inti
mated that they were ready to repudiate
the action of the State Convention as not
binding on them, bat cold men are there,
and the air about the California delegation
has in it a vague premonition that there is
â omething the matter with the silver unit
rule.
Foote, White, Maguire and other silver
men are plainly alarmed at the prospect
that California may not cast eighteen
Totes solidly for the 16-to-l and no consent
plank, and they are already watching,
talking and urging in a rnignty effort to
keep California Democracy in the silver
column. Whether or not they will suc
ceed promises to remain doubtful until
the vote on toe platform in the conven
tion.
Harry "Wise is evidently the member of
the delezation most inclined to help save
the Nation from disaster, and he will lead
any bolt to sound money that may occur.
Harry's father, as collector of the port,
brings administration influence very
closely and safely to Harry's mind, and
the presence of strong influences of thÂ«
administration is evidenced on the train
that speeds to Chicago.
Everybody has heard about lots of tele
grama from Whitney and others in the
East to members of the delegation who
are known to be personally sound money
men, but nobody displays any of the said
telegrams or confesses to the receipt of
any. The talking of Harry Wise on the
money question and on his conscience
may interest in view of this sitnation.
Harry is a gay boy and a jolly good fel
low, but be talks politics well.
"My position is like this," he explained,
with one foot on the opposite cushion.
"I believe in supporting principles con
ducive to the best interests ft the coun
try. I stand for the highest interests of
the country rather than for any political
opportunity of the party. I will not vote
for any piank in the platform which, in
my opinion, antagonize 8 the Dusiness in
terests of the country. I am a merchant
with large business interests and I go to
Chicago to vote, not as a politician, but as
a business man with nothing to seek po
litically. Tne solid men of my district
have sent me to Chicago to use my judg
ment and not to follow political fantasies.
I am a bimetallism but not a silver crank.
I am a Democrat and not an opportunist.
"There are many in the delegation Who
don't believe in silver who will vote for
silver because that was the dictum of the
State convention, but this delegation is
cot pledged to any candidate and the con
servative men in this delegation will not
give their votÂ«s to any man who would in
any way injure the Dusiness interests of
the country. lam for Whitney first ana
for Stevenson if Whitney is not presented.
I have known Mr. Whitney personally for
t-everal years. H.s wife's cousin was a
roommate and classmate of mine. I ad
mire Mr. Whitney and I have served no
tice on the delegation that 1 am for him."
Harry Wi?e, by the way, is one of the
Democrats we can bump upapainst almost
.any hour who are out for protection.
Harry has had considerable woolly experi
ence and he declared for protection for
wool.
"I am going to insist at Chicago that
the party declare for a revenue tariff, in
view of the deficiency in the revenues,"
he sai 1. in further elucidation of bis Chi
cago programme. "I want to see a tariff
on all raw and manufactured wool. Wool
has suffered from the depression more
than any other raw material, l was for
free wool for many years, but I've got
sick of it."
All around, Harry Wise is a very im
portant and promising member of the
California delegation. Mr. Wise has ap
parently not talked with quite as much
frankness to W. W. Foote, who is one of
the several who are claiming that John H.
Wise gave his son into their especial care,
i As to the rest of the delegation, they ap
pear to realize only the danger and not
the promise of what Harry declared to
The Call.
"I think that this thing of district dele
gates not being bound by the unit rule on
the silver question is just talk." said Mr.
Foote. "They can't break away and will
not be permitted to do it. If any of them
try itâ"
Focte stopped without declaring what
would happen or how it would be done,
but he looked very severe and ready to
swear.
"How about this, White?" he called, as
the Senator came along.
"I certainly regard the whoie delegation
as bound to support a straight free-silver
plank, in accordance with the resolution
of the State convention, and 1 assume
that nobody will do anything else," said
the Senator.
"Whitney is not going to come around
asking people to break pledges," said
Foote.
"The California delegation will certainly
be bound by the unit rule on the silver
plank," declared Judge Maguire. "The
district conventions were constituent parts
of the State convention and none of them
disavowed the action of the general body.
A delegate who should now repudiate the
State platform would probably be obliged
to spend the rest of his public life explain
ing bis action."
The stalwarts will whip Harry Wise
into the traces if they can.
This delegation, as it speeds to one of
the most important political conventions
of American history, is contrasted by the
smallness of the crowd wit Ji the ones that
whooped their way to Chicago in 1892 and
to St. Louis in 1588, wli^n there was nearer
a hundred Californians along instead of
twenty-five or thirty all told. It keeps up
the regulation amount of California bospi
.tality, however, and what is left of 400
cases when Chicago is reached will be
dispensed at the tine headquarters at the
Great Northern. The Auditorium people
had the Californians four years ago at
$100 a day for neadquarters. Harry Wise
telegrapned for the same rooms this year
and the price quoted was "two hundred."
There may be nothing personal about that,
though.
By" the irony of railroad chances the
silver delegation travels in the car "El
Oro" and by the irony of something else
the banner on its inside reads, "Democ
racy and Prosperity."
"We've had fouryears of that," observed
a long-whiskered fellow at the Oakland
mole.
In the dining car at 7 p. m. there sat at
two adjoining tabier. Messrs. Foote. White,
Maguire and Coleman, and this recalled
the fact that four years ago Foote, White,
and Coleman were also delegates-at-lar>;e,
the fourth being A. B. Butler of Fresno.
"As far as Mr. Foote and I are con
cerned the delegation compares very
favorably with that of four years ago," re
marked Steve White, who has already be
come the chief story teller of the crowd.
And speaking of that dinner by the way :
there sat opposite to Mr. Foote at his
table another one of those ordinary busi
ness men and life-long Democrats, who let
it be known that he was going to vote for
protection and sound money this year.
Ex-Congressman A. Caminetti is on the
train, and at 7:30 p.m. he was elected a
delegate from the Second District, neither

i National platform. Caminetti was chair

to urge Caminetti to go along.

The delegates and alternates not already
mentioned who are on the train are:
James V. Coleman. Robert Fitzgerald, J.
j J. Dwyer. Louis Metiger, Dr. D. r, Ratran,
George E. Church, Oscar A. Irippert, W.
;B. Wilsuire, T. F. Darmody. Very few
have taken members of their families
along.
"Billy" Rice, the Union Pacific hustler,
and Al Murpny of the Examiner are
among the few outside of the delegation
who are with the party.
Five other delegations will be picked up
jen route. One of the contesting Nevada
| delegations will get on to-morrow and at
Ogden and Denver the Caiifornian3 will
j see the delegations from Oregon, Montana,
: Utah and Colorado.
The delegation expects to caucus to
j morrow and it may possibly elect a chair
| man then. There is naturally not yet
much of a general consensus of 'opinion as
to the result of a getting together. Presi
dential candidates are all open questions.
It does not seem likely that the California
vote can be thrown in a bunch for any
body, but an effort wijl be made to work
up an agreement to establish ttie unit rule
and make the California vote effective.
"The individual preferences of tue dele
gates." said Maguire to-night, "seem to be
pretty evenly divided among the leading
candidates. lam inclined to favor Bland,
though I strongly favor Stevenson. I

ences, and, in fact, like everybody else, is
at sea regarding the convention.
"Personally I don't think I will favor
abolishing the unit rule," he said in the
course o. a talk. "I don't think it will be
necessary to take drastic steps like that.
The silver men will rule, and nobody can
guess who will be nominated."
~ J. J. Dwyer thinks that Whitney 'will
come pretty near running things at Chi
cago. "1 think that t c platform will de
clare for silver,'' said Dwyer, "and that
the one man w o will have most to say
about the nomination will be Whitney. 1
anticipate that tbe gold votes will be put
into his hands, and that at a critical time
he will throw them to the least objection
able of the silver or compromise candi
dates. Pennsylvania, New York and
Massachusetts are close together on the
rollcall, and be could easily throw those
votes at a critical time and create a
stampede.
"Bland is the most talked about here,
but he is a one-idea man and I don't think
he is a winner. The California delegation
will undoubtedly stand by its instructions
and vote solidly for silver at 16 to 1 to the
last ditch. That will be my course."
When the train reached Sacramento, at
10:30 o'clock, the Sacramento Iroquois
Club, several hundred citizens, a brass
band and much hurrah greeted the dele
gates. The big guns ot the delegation
oegan their two-minute speechmaking
from the car steps, and did quite we'l.
The crowd howled for White and White
told an eloquent silver story in a few
words. "As we co along we will convince
Mr. Hanna and his friends that the silver
question is something of an issue after
all." said the Senator.
Foote announced with vigor of lung that
the delegation was on its way to name the
next President of the United States. He
tried to commit Harry Wise to silver, too.
"I want you to watch this California
delegation,' 1 he said, "and you will see
that every pledge we are bound by is ful
filled to the letter. I believe that you will
see eighteen solid rotes for everything
that we were pledged to two weeks ago."
Magnire talked silver and the Demo
cratic chance for a grand victory, and his
belief that the National Convention would
not adopt any straddle planks intended to
fool people.
James V. Coleman told his fellow-
Democrats that the silver agitation was
not a Populnt or anarchistic move, and
wnen his share of the cheering was done
Church of Fresno had bis say.
Then the California delegation rolled
on in the night toward the sagebrush,
with its path as dark and uncertain as the
one across the river on tbe boundary of
Yolo County. J. O. Denny.
AT OAKLAND MOLE.
Loyal Democrats Speed Delegates
on Their Way With Cheers
and Good Wishes.
Iroquois braves, a hundred strong, made
the old Piedmont shake on her 5:30 trip
last evening with the Democratic hilarity
and jubilation she carried. From the time
the boat left the slip to the time it tied up
at the Mole a continuous round of cheer 9
for the delegates to Chicago was kept uo.
James V. Coleman and Louis Metzger, the
idols of the Iroquois, and also Congress
man Maguire, came in for a generous share
of the plaudits.
During the half hour before the train
pulled out general jubilation was held at
the pier. Bob Allen and his band impreg
nated the zephyrs with tbe sweet strains
of "The Bully," '"Mah Angeline" and
"He's a Jolly Good Fellow." Fred Raabe,
irrepressibiy hilarious, acted as drum
major and manipulated his cane as a baton
with an agility that would make a pro
fessional envious. Now and again in his
enthusiasm he would commence to dance,
executing wonderful serpentine gyrations
with bewildering rapidity. In his tcrpsi
chorean efforts he was ably seconded by
S. V. Merle and Max Popper.
The 6 o'clock boat took another large
crowd of Democrats across the bay. Sen
ator White, ex-Congiessman Caminetti,
Registrar Hinton and ex-Sheriff McDade
were conspicuous among the throng. Long
John Wilkins was down at the ferry, not
to go with the delegation as he haa so
often gone of yore, but merely to see his
old friends off. "Going?" he demanded,
"well I guess not. I'm a Republican, sir.
I was a Democrat before you were born,
but John Wilkins votes the Republican
ticket this year. I'm tired of being a lick
spittle for the Democratic party, and
that's the reason why."
On the other side the crowd pressed
about the delegates to shak<j hands and
say good-by. The cheers and music kept
up a continuous din. The delegates, with
neat badges of purple and gold, over which
hung the S:ate seal in silver and a silver
bear, stood on the platforms of the cars or
uttered their adieus from their windows.
Louis Metzser was led up and down the
depot arm in arm with Fred Raabe fol
lowed by the band. Then all adjourned
to the car where a generous supply of Cali
fornia wine had been stored to help the
delegates across the desert, and healths
were drunk profusely.
As the long train finally pulled out the
band struck up "The Girl I Left Behind
Me," and many a loyal Iroquois brave
turned his face homeward and sighed a
disappointed sigh that he was not one of
the jolly party already speeding eastward.

Chicago, 111., July 1.)
The first day of midsummer is savagely
hot in Chicago. You could almost boil an
egg in the lake. The effect of the heat on
the delegates from the Rocky Mountain
and Pacific States is especially distressing,
Yet there is great activity in Democratic
circles and interest in the coming conven
tion increases with each passing day.
About the hotel corridors, at the head
quarters of the different candidates and
the clubrooms of different party organiza
tions great nwarms of excited men are
seen.
The campaign for the Democratic Presi
dential nomination before the convention
of 1596 is indeed in full blast. There was,
however, no particular change in the situ
ation to-day. The silver men are busy
counting up their majority. They are
well organized and fully equipped to meet
the enemy, and believe they will bare lit
tle difficulty in gaining the victory. The
gold forces, on the other hand, are equally
determined, and when Whitney gets here
to-morrow the fur will begin to fly in sev
eral directions.
Bland seems to be still in the lead for
the Presidential nomination, with Boies a
close second. Matthews will control his
o.vn delegation, but is not likely to gain
much strength outside of Indiana. Black
burn is spoken of quite frequently, and
White of California seems to be considered
with some favor, especially for second
place on the ticket. With a Southern man
at the head of the ticket the second place
will probably go to the far East or the far
West. Tbe South and West, however, now
that they realize their absolute power, are
not unwilling to accept the whole bakery.
Bland's boom received an impetus to
day when it was discovered that Governor
Stone of Missouri was making love to Gov
ernor Altgeld of Illinois, and that old
time invitation that tbe Governor of North
Carolina extended to the Governor of
South Carolina-frequently passed between
tbi chief exeÂ«uÂ«vÂ«s who are struggling so
hard to control the destinies of the ap
proaching convention and through It the
National Democracy.
While these two leaders of the "un
washed Democracy" are hobnobbing to
gether, drinking mint juleps aud flirting
with the unsophisticated delegate from
the interior, another little Presidential
boom flew in that they nothing about
until late in the day. It bad
wings, but they seemed to be clipped.
It was centered about the person of Vice-
President Adlai E. Stevenson, who arrived
from Blooraington, 111., to-day and en
gaged a room at the Palmer House. Mr.
Stevenson has thus far taken no p*|t in
tbe silver controversy, and is looked upon
as a dark nor-e. He is in training for the
race and awaits the tap of the bell. It is
known that Stevenson bas a Jarge follow
ing in the South, and should tbe Illinois
delegation support him he would make a
formidable candidate against the free sil
ver philosophers who are now so enthusi
astically mentioned in connection with tbe
presidential nomination.
The Vice-Presideat received me cor
dially, and so nicely did he refuse to dis
cuss the great principles of last year's
Democracy that I did not press him forau
opinion.
The arrival of Chairman Harrity of the
National Committee did not create a rip
ple of interest. The silver men believe
that they could get along just as well
without him, and as far as they are con
cerned he might as well remain at home.
Harrity is a persona non grata to the sil
ver wing of the National Democracy, and
should he insist on forcing upon them a
gold man for temporary chairman they
will probably take the affairs of th-3 con
vention into their own hands.
The National Reform party, which was
organized a year ago by Professor William
J. Seelye of Wooster University, Ohio, has
opened up headquarters here, and will
make a fight to have its platform indorsed
by the Chicago convention. Among other
things, the preamble declares for the equal
coinage of silver and gold at 16 to 1; the
abolition of the liquor traffic; restriction
of immigration; equal suffrage regardless
of sex, with a reasonable educational
qualification ; an adequate protective tariii ;
settlement of international disputes by
arbitration; suppression of all organized
trusts; postal savings banks, and election
of United States Senators by direct vote of
the people. All these provisions and more
of a like character the managers of the new
party are anxious to shoulder on the old
line Democrats of the country.

IN CHICAGO LOBBIES.
Expressions From Delegates on the
Issues Before the Democratic
Convention.
CHICAGO, 111., July Lâ W. H. Wnite
of Seattle, a delegate from the State
of Washington to the National Dem
ocratic Convention, arrived at the
Sherman House this morning. He puts
a different complexion on the Washing
ton delegation as regards the financial
question tnat has been painted by Hugh
Wallace. It will be remembered that Mr.
Wallace gave out a statement a few days
ago declaring that the Washington dele
gation was solid for gold; in fact he baa
ail along been making a hard fight for the
yellow metal. After his conference with
Mr. Whitney at New York last week be
came directly to Chicago, opened up head
quarters at the Auditorium and began
skirmishing for votes to elect himself tem
porary chairman of the National Con
vention.
"It would be a crime to make Wallace
temporary chairman," said Mr. White to
me to-ciay, "because he is a violent and
unreasonable enemy oi silver, and to his
own delegation would be the most objec
tionable of any man who has been men
tioned for the place. Wallace has not
been in the State of Washington for sev
erai months and we have very little use for
him out there since be has spent his time
traveling about the East crying down the
chief interests of the State. If the silver
men control tbe National Convention, and
lam told that ttiey have at least two
thirds majority already, Wallace will never
go back into the National Committee. He
is a Cleveland man, and as such is entitled
to no consideration. The iact is Wallace
is nere as a delegate through the courtesy
of the Democrats of Washington, and
mark me the delegation will certainly
turn him down. We are not particular
who is made temporary chairman of the
National Committee, but we want to see a
statesman there, and not an inexperienced
man like Wallace.
"Wal'ace has been misrepresenting the
sentiment of the Democracy of Washing
ton. He has stated that the eight dele
gates from that State were for gold, while
the fact is that we adopted a silver plat
form at our convention, and five of the
delegates are out-and-out silver men, and
we have hopes of winning over to our side
one of the other three gold men. I be
lieve that I am safe in saying that S5 per
cent of Washington people are for silver,
and with the right man and a silver plat
form we can carry the State by 10,000 ma
jority. Yet, in contradiction of these
facts, Wallace tells the people of the East
that we are all gold bugs.
"Wallace would never iiave been sent to
Chicago if it had not been to prevent a
fight A few Federal officials got into the
State convention, and rather than have a
fight burden the party with personal
hatred and factional bitterness we agreed
to let him come on to the convention as a
delegate at large."
Mr. White is a strong Bland man, and
broke bread with the Missouri delegation
at its headquarters to-day.
Major Towles of Missouri, secretary of
the Democratic Bimetallic Committee,
gave me an audience to-day. He is one of
the most interesting and striking person
alities in the silver Democracy. Though
somewhat advanced in years he is very
active, and takes the keenest interest in
the campaign now before the country. He
is a student of men and measures, and is
acquainted with all the public men who
have figured before the country for the
last quarter of a century. He has been
chief cierk of the House of Representatives
since 1875, and therefore had a good op
portunity to measure tbe worth of the
country's National legislators. He was
secretary of the Democratic National
Campaign Committee of 1890 ana 1891,
which made such a hard fight on the Reed l
Congress, and with great pride he telis the
story of the 149 majority the Democrats
had in the Fifty-second Congress.
"If I were to write the Democratic plat
form of 1896," said Major Towles to me, in
discussing the situation here, "I would in
corporate a silver plank providing for the
free coinage of silver at 16 to 1 and attach
Jefferson's inaugural address as a pream
ble to the document, that it might inspire
the Democracy of the Nation. Will we
carry the convention? There is no ques- |
tion about it, my boy; we can alreacy
mark 630 delegates to our credit. That is
more than a two-thirds majority.
"We will treat the gold men respect
fully. Wa will make any reasonable con
cessions to them in the matter of selecting
a temporary chairman; but we are deter
mined that no individualities, personali
ties or sectional differences snail thwart
the will of the people in this great gather- {
ing. The silver Democrats are clearly in I
confc-01. We will dictate the platform,
and after that is accomplished we will
look about for a fellow to stand on it.
"Personally, lam for Bland. I regard j
him as the logical candidate. He can j
carry the South and the West without â 
difficulty, and will make a big haul for the
East. And we will make a big hele in
Major McKinley's majority in the East.
In case we cannot have Bland, I f.m wiil
ing to stand by any other candidate the j
convention may agree upon, whether he
come from Maine, from any other Eastern j
State, from the Mississippi Valley or from I
California."
"California will present the name of
Stephen M. White," I remarked.
"We could not decide upon a better
man," replied Major Towlts, with great

CANTON, Ohio, July I.â This has been
one of Major McKinley's busiest days. In
addition to the work of meeting delega
tions and receiving callers this morning
he had a long talk with Mr. Hobart. This
afternoon 500 glass-workers came from
Massilion. Many of them were Demo
crats, but announced that they would vole
for McKinley. In response to a speech
by their spokesruan Major McKinley made
a short address on the subject of the tariff
and its advantages, one of which was that
we had secured the first rank in the manu
facture of glass in this country.
The picturesque and unique event of the
campaign was the visit of 3000 delegates to
the State convention of Christian Endeav
orers, now in session. Bhortly after 4
o'clock, this army of men and women
marched to the McKinley residence in two
great battalions. As many as could find
standing room in the spacious grounds
crowded in and formed a dense mass.
Those iv tbe rear filled the street on
the sides for the distance of a block in
either direction. It was an impressive
scene.
Wh en Major McKinley appeared he was
greeted with cheers and the Chautauqua
salute. He spoke in part as follows :
Free Governments hare uniformly recog
nized their dependence upon a higher power,
and have taken steps to the promotion of
morality and the diffusion of knowledge
among their citizens. In the United States
this has been steadily the aim of our local and
State governments, and in the advancement
of this great work of good, the people without
respect to their denominational connection
have had an active and useful oarr. In every
charitable, broad and generous effort, I bid
you, ladies and gentlemen, godspeed, and
commend to your observation and for your ex
ample that noble policy, that true, that patri
otic devotion to morality and uplifting of
mankind which so conspicuously distinguished
the founders of this mighty country. Let us
cherish the institutions of civil and religious
liberty which they planted in the wilderness,
and continue them in all their vigor and
strength for the generations yet to come.
The Christian Endeavor hosts had not
departed before carriages drove up con
taining Hon. Richard C. Kerens and a
party of Br. Louis gentlemen and promi
nent men in political and business circles.
The St. Louis delegation left shortly be

attaches to its visit, because it was the first

employers of labor to call on Major Mc-
Kinley.
NEBRASKA REPUBLICANS.
Mac Coll of Dawson Nominated for
Governor on the) Fifth
Ballot.
LINCOLN, Nebb., July I.â The virtue
of perseverance was manifested to-day In
the Republican State Convention, when J.
H. Mac Coll of Dawson County, three
times a candidate for the gubernatorial
nomination, triumphed over a very strong
field, receiving the nomination on the fifth
ballot by a practically unanimous vote.
His strongest opponents were: Congress
man George D. Meiklejohn, M. L. Hay
ward, Euzene Moore, C. M. Adams and
Elijah Filley. Aside from soirited con
tests for the treasurership and auditorship,
the convention waa not exciting. The
platform on National issues is a vittual re
iteration of the St. Louis declarationsâ for
sound money, protection and reciprocity.
It was adopted without dissent.
It was 10:30 when Chairman Mallalieu
of the State Central Committee called the
convention to order. He announced the
selection of General George W. Collins of
Pawnee City as temporary chairman. The
selection of secretaries and the appoint
ment of committees followed.
The temporary organization was made
permanent. A ballot for the Governor
was ordered. The first ballot gave the
real strength. Mac Coll leading with 260,
Meiklejohn 206, Moora 157, Adams 154,
Hayward 116, Filley 126. the balance scat
tering. Up to the sixth ballot there was
little change. Then Filley threw his en
tire vote to Mac Coll; Douglass County
followed with its solid vote, together with
Lancaster and Nehama, other smaller
counties joining in the stampede, running
the total vote up to 612. Mac Coll was
escorted to the platform and made a brief
address.
Orlando Tefft was nominated for Lieu
tenant-Goveruor on tbe first ballot, and J.
A. Piper for Secretary of State by ac
clamation. The contest for State Auditor
was warm, ending in the selection of P. O.
Hedlund. The ticket was completed as
follows: Treasurer, E. E. Casey of Pawnee
City; Attorney-General, A. S. Churchill
of Omaha; Commissioner of Public Lands
and Buildings, H. C. Russell of Schuyler;
Superintendent of Public Instruction, H.

â  â HARRIET BEECHER
STOWE IS DEAD,
The Talented Authoress
Passes Peacefully
Away.
HER DEATH PAINLESS
Literary Works That Gained
for Her a World-Wide
Reputation.
STORY OF AN EVENTFUL LIFE.
"Uncle Tom's Cabin" Did a Great
Deal to Further the Emancipa
tion of Slaves.
HARTFORD, Conn., Joly L-Mrs. Har
riet Beecher Stowe, the gifted authoress of
"Uncle Tom's Cabin," "Dred," and other
works of world-wide reputation, died at
â  her home, 73 Forest street, at neon to-day
without regaining consciousness. She
passed peacefully away as though in a
deep sleep. By her bedside at the time
vrere her son. her two daughters, her mar
ried sister, her husband, Dr. Edward
Hooker, her nephew, who was also her
medical attendant, and other relatives.
Her illness was the culmination of a
mental derangement from which Mrs.
Etowe has suffered for years, tenderly
cared for by her two daughters. It is a
.long time since she has been able to do
literary work, and for the past two years
her condition has been such that the
worst might be expected at any time. Of
this however, the public has not been
generally aware.
A trained nurse has been in constant
attendance upon Mrs. Stowe. She walked
about in company with her patient
through the garden grounds every
morning.
Mrs. Stowe exhibited considerable vigor
for her years, physically, and always had
a smile for her friends. She repeated one
of her poems recently, and there have
been moments when her intellect was
still unclouded, and it was only of late
that her power of speech was affected.
She was able to guide a pjn with the as
sistance of one of her daughters not long
ago.
All in all, sha has been a physiological
marvel, as she lived in a house filled with
mementos of days when she moved
nations and people from every quarter of
the elobe paid tribute to her greatness
with souvenirs of the most precious kind.
Saturday, June 13. she was 85 years of
age. Last Friday morning her attendant,
Mrs. Arms, when she went to call her,
found that she was in a semi-conscious
condition. Her nephew, Dr. Edward B.
Hooker, and his sister, Mrs. Isabella
Beecher-Hooker, were called, and the mat
.â¢.r *\u? kept a secret till last night to avoid
the annoyance of inquiries that were sure
to come from all parts of the country.
The cause of Mrs. Stowe's illness was con
gestion of the brain with partial paralysis.
Harriet Beecher Stowe was born in
Litchfield, Conn., June 14, 1812. Her
father was the Rev. Dr. Lyman Beecher.
At the death of her mother Mrs. Stowe
was placed under the care of her grand
mother at Guilford, Conn.
Here, when quite a young girl, she
snowed a great interest in the ballads of
Walter Scott and the poems of Robert
Burns. The Arabian Nights also fascinated
her. When a schoolgirl of 12, she wrote a
logical essay on the theme, "Can the im
mortality of the soul be proved from the
light of nature?" Many of her father's
sermons were on the sin of slavery, and
from her earliest youth Mrs. Stowe was
taught to abhor human bondaee.
In January, 1836. she married Calvin
Ellis Stowe, a Massachusetts clergyman.
She frequently visited the Southern States,
and was thoroughly acquainted with the
slave methods in vogue there. Her book
entitled "Uncle Tom's Cabin; or. Life
Among the Lowly," created a big sensa
tion. It opened the eyes of the Northern
people and did much toward the eman
cipation of the slaves. Her best literary
effort wascalled "The Minister's Wooing.' 1
James Russell Lowell praised it very much.
Mrs. Stowe also wrote a number of other
works which have been higi.ly commended.
HO BODIES YET FOUND,
Discouraging Task of Rescuers
at the Twin Shaft
Mine.
In Constant Peril Themselves and Si
Hundred Feet From the En
tombed Men.
WILKESBARRE, Pa.-, July 1. - The
situation at the Twin shaft to-day is not
so hopeful as it was yesterday, when con
siderable progress was made down the
elope. No bodies have yet been recovered,
there have been no indications that the
bodies are near, and it is doubtful if any
will be found for days to come.
When the shift of rescuers came out this
afternoon they reported that only ten feet
had been dut; into the cave up to 3 o'clock.
This alow work is due to the fact that tae
men encountered another fall of coal this
morning.
Mine Inspector McDonald said this after
noon that the rescuers were at least 600
feet from the entombed men, and if there
was much rocK and heavy falls ahead of
them it would take a long time before they
would come on the bodies. The bore hole
which had been started through the bar
rier that separated the Clear Spring mine
from the Twin ; haft on the other side of
tl c cave was completed to-day. The hole
is only an inch or two in diameter, and
was put through the 100 feet of coal to find
whether there was water or gas in the
mine.
As soon as the drill was drawn no water
came through, and there is very little gas
from the mine.
A consultation was held by the officials
today, and it was decided not to tunnel
from the Clear Spring mine, for the reason
that it is at least 2500 feet from the pillar
at which the men are supposed to be, and
it is onlv6oo feet from where the rescuers
arp now at work on the other side of the
fall. The work of rescue will be prose
cuted through the slope.

earnestness. "His name was on my lips.
I regard him as one of the ablest of our
National lawmakers, and along with James
G. Maguire, California is ably represented
in the Congressional nails of the Nation.
Either of these men would be acceptable
to me, and I think the convention would ;
make no mistake in nominating either of !
them.
"I believe I am competent to 'size up'
a really big man when I see him in the
House or Senate at Washington, and let
me tell you, young man, it takes a big
man to make an impression in Congress.
A lightweight may come there, make a
speech, be listened to with some attention
and the next day be forgotten, but the
man of brains who is there for a purpose,
who sympathizes- w>t:~i the people, who
works and votes in tneir interests-*a man
of knowledge, character and conviction â
compels the American parliament to listen
to him and to be influenced by his
counsel."
Captain Evan?, chairman of the lowa
delegation, is confident that Boies will be
nominated. He adds that in case the
Governor becomes the candidate he will
carry lowa by 25,000 majority despite the
fact that the State has long been a Repub
lican stronghold. He does not think that
the action of the trades unions in prepar
ing a labor petition in opposition to
the candidacy of Boies will influence
the convention one way or the other.
Governor Altceld's anarchistic following,
however, believes otherwise. It is be
lieved that ttlis movement is one of Alt
geld's to beat the lowa statesman out of
the nomination. The enmity of the former
toward Boies is attributed to the fact that
the lowan made a speech in which he up
held the position of President Cleveland
in sending Federal troops to Chicago dur
ing the great railroad strike. Altgeld is
making all he possibly can out of this in
cident.
"I do not think," said Captain Evans,
"that Governor Altgeld will op<:nly fight
Governor Boies for the Presidential nomi- !
nation. They have always been good
friends, and I do not see why they should
not continue to be. Governor Boies has
always been friendly to labor, and that
that element should want to defeat
him for the nomination seems to be
very unreasonable. The delegates irom
lowa feel that Governor Boies will
be nominated, but in case he is not
chosen by the convention the ticket will
be loyally supported In our State, regard
less of the man who is at its head. We
are feeling very hopeful, but are doing no
loud shouting for our candidate just yet.
The thousands who will pour into the city
irom lowa on Monday and Tuesday will
do all the 'rooting,' as they say here in
Chicago, that will be required. The South
will be solid for the ticket."
"With the possible exception of Mary
land," suggested a delegate from Missouri.
"Yes, and Delaware is a little doubtful,"
observed a second.
"And there are some doubts about West
Virginia, don't you think, Captain?" in
quired a tall southerner.
Captain Evans admitted that these
States were probably a little shaky from a
Democratic standpoint. In fact, he made
a number of concessions to the Republi
cans, and as 1 arose to leave the room a

Kentucky Colonel observed that it was
just possible William McKinley might be
come the next President of the United
States.
J. D. Showalterof Lexington, Mo., and
a delegate from that State to the Chicago
convention, assured me to-day that there
was nothing in the story that Governor
Stone of Missouri had entered the field
as a candidate for the Presidential nomi
nation. Said he:
'â¢The enemies of Bland are giving cur
rency to the yarn about Stone being a
candidate. Why, Governor Stone has al
ways been a consistent Bland man. They
would like to see him oppose Bland, how
ever, as such a conflict would be a means
!to the end which tiiey seek. These same
| men are trying to create the impression
that Bland is a Southern man. His
brother served in the Union army, and all
the members of the Bland family are
loyal to the Union. 'Silver Dick* himself
was in California during the war, and
theretore took no part in it. Stone, of
course, is a Southern man; thus the in
consistency of these Bland men in tryng
to force Stone into the field to the detri
ment of Bland. Bland will be nominated
to spite their efforts. He above all others
typifies the platform on which the Demo
crats will go before the country. He is a
platform in himself. He is a Democrat,
and a Democrat of one ideaâ that all men
are created equal." Frank McGuirk.
SCHEMING FOR CONTROL.
Plans of Sliver Men to Cain the
Necessary Two-Thirds
Majority.
CHICAGO, 111., July I.â The recon
noiter to-day of the skirmish guard of the
silver forces upon the outposts of the
National Democratic committee, as
planned by its sub-committee, was vari
ously viewed by the participants after the
former had retired to its own camp. Ac
cording to Chairman Harrity. the visiting
delegation, composed of Senators Turpie,
Daniels, Jones and Governors Stone and
j Altgeld, simply "fenced for points." And,
according to Governor AJtgeld and Sena
tor Daniels, the fencing was entirely satis
factory to the silver side. At least one of
their colleagues, however, was inclined to
regard the outcome as a draw, with the
indications favorable to the silver men
getting tne worst of it when final conclu
sions were tried with the National com
! mittee next Monday.
The action of the Illinois delegation in
determining to lead the attack for the
abrogation of the two-thirds rule was a
fruitful topic of discussion, and during the
day it developed that Governor A ltgeld's
scheme was in danger from an unexpected
source and that Michigan rather than Illi
nois might become the pivotal State and
wield the balance of power in the conven
tion. The two delegates from the Fifth
District of that State, William F. Mc-
Knight and George P. Hummer, both
active free silverites, were among the vis
itors at headquarters and conferred at
length witb the members of the executive
committee.
The situation in the Wolverine State is
that while fourteen out of the twenty-six
delegates are silverites, the delegation is
instructed for gold and bound to that
standard by the unit rule. It is proposed,
however, to precipitate a fight
on the reform of that rule in
j advance of any action on the two
[ thirds issue. In the event of the unit rule
being declared invalid, there will be no
necessity for the substitution of a majority
vote for the two-thirds vote, for the silver
votes of the Wolverine State would give
that side the necessary nominating major
ity and one or two to epare. This was the

GREETING TO TELLER.
Coloradans Give Noisy Approval
of His Course In Standing:
by Silver.
DENVER, Col., July 1.-Senator Henry
M. Teller could have aroused the West to
no greater demonstrations of approval
had be been a sovereign of an empire or
a President of a republic. All last night
his progress west from Omaha along the
line of the Union Pacific was marked by
noisy demonstrations at every stopping
point in NebrasKa. Bands met him with
energetic martial and patriotic airs,
I crowds cheered and demanded a speech,
j and at many places the Senator was fairly
i dragged from the train and mounted upon
j boxes, where he could be seen as he
thanked the people for their good feelings
toward him and the cause he has been
championing. It was long after midnight
before his party or any other passengers
on the train could take any comfort or
rest
At an early hour this morning the Sen
ator and his wife stepped from the train
at Greeley, where Lieutenant-Governor
Jud Brusn met him and drove the guests
to his comfortable ranch home, wbere a
quiet day was passed.
At 2:30 p. m. Receiver Trumbull's special
car, attached to a special excursion train,
left the Union depot bearing tne reception
committee, which reached Greeley at an
early hour. There Senator Teller was met
and taken under their escort. Governor
Mclntire, Mayor McMurray, I. N. Stevens,
C. S. Thomas. Irving Howbert, Alva
Adams, T. M. Patterson, J. B. Grant and
other prominent citiz<ns of all political
parties were included in this committee.
The explosion of a bomb at the Union
depot at 7:45 o'clock announced the ar
rival of the Greeley train; a second bomb
gave notice that Senator Teller was in the
carriage, and a third bomb at 8 o'clock
was the signal for the parade to move.
Ttie streets at that hour along the line of
marcb were densely crowded with enthu
siastic voters of both sexes, and Se-.iator
Teller's progress at the head of the parade
was easily marked by the roars of cheers
that rapidly rolled up Seventeenth street
and thence along a devious line of march,
formally passing in review before the
grand stand erected in front of the Brown
Palace Hotel.
Tne parade was a great affair. Many
bands were in tlie procession. Gilpin
County citizens were given the place of
honor, just behind Senator Teller's car
riage. The Colorado National Guards, the
several cadet companies and tne artillery
made up the military part of the parade.
Old pioneers came next, women marching
with men; then a great line of civic,
social, political, benevolent and trades
societies followed.
During the progress of the paraae fire
works were touched off all over the city,
and the streets resounded with the noise
of cheering and of explosives.
Arriving at the hotel, Senator Teller met
the entire delegation from St. Louis, which
had so manfully stood by his side, and ac
companied by the ladies of the party and
the reception committee, he proceeded to
the reviewing stand. His appearance
there was the signal for one mighty and
prolonged shout of welcome from a great
crusti of people who filled Broadway,
Court place and Seventeenth street for a
distance of a block in five directions from
the reviewing stand. There Governor Mc
lntire made a brief address of welcome on
behalf of the people of the Btate, and Sena
tor Teller replied. Neither address was a
set speech, but was the result of the in
spiration of the occasion.

STRIKERS MEET DEATH.
Fatal Encounter Between Deputy
Sheriffs and Riotous
Workmen.
Ohio Militiamen Called Out to Assist
in Preserving the Peace at
Berea.
CLEVELAND, 0., July I.â The strike
at the quarries of the Cleveland Stone
Company to-day resulted in the death of
Vinton Macliurski and the fatal wounding
of John Melosky. Joseph Wanosky and
Antoine Totak sustained flesh wounds
which are not serious.
A battle between Sheriff LeeK, with
forty deputies and 200 strikers took place
at West View, three miles from Berea.
The mob had driven out the workmen.
When the Sheriff arrived he ordered the
mob to disperse. They refused and a shot
was fired at Deputy Carman. The Sheriff
then ordered his men to fire and nbout
sixty shots were exchanged, half of the
mob tied.
While the Sheriffs were fighting their
battle strikers assailed another party of
depnties at the of yesterday's riot
and put them to flight. The Sheriff early
In the afternoon asked for troops and Com
pany F of Cleveland and Company D of
Berea were called out. C. Smith, the dep
i uty whom Machurski in his ante-mortem
statement accused of tiring the fatal shot,
was arrested and brought to the Cleveland
! jail. The streets are .guarded to-night by
j deputy sheriffs and the militia. The Poles
! are wild with rage and it is feared serious
) trouble will occur to-morrow.

The Leander crew rowed over the first

RED CROSS SOCIETY MEETING
Burial of Lieutenant Thurston of the
United States Cruiser
Detroit
VANCOUVER, 8.C., July 1.-The fol
lowing Oriental advices were received here
by the steamer Empress of China, which
arrived this morning:
The Nippon Yusen Kaisha, the latest
steamship company of Japan, recently de
cided to increase its capital from eight
million to ten million yen. It is proposed
to extend the existing lines and to open
new ones. Among the latter the first will
probably be across the Pacific to Puget
Sound. Mr. lwanaga was delegated by
the company to close the pending contract
with the Great Northern Railway for
Seattle to be the American terminus of the
new Trans-Pacific line. Mr. lwanaga
came over on the China, and, after trans
acting his business at Seattle, will visit
New York and the cotton districts of the
South.
Professor Schaeberle of the Lick Ob
servatory, Professor Campbell of Stanford
University and Professor Burckhalter of
Oakland, with two lay scientists, have ar
rived in Japan and are on their way
north to make arrangements for observing
the solar eclipse in August. The Japan
ese Government very courteously allowed
all their telescopes and appliances to be
landed without inspection. The Imperial
Observatory of Tokio has offered to send
one of its staff with the American party.
The Hongkong Telegraph has published
the startling telegram that Russia has in
timated to Japan that she must withdraw
from Formosa. Whether this be true or
not, it is a remarkable fact that Russia has
massed at Vladivostock a strong fleet,
100,000 men and vast stores of war ma
terial. England is recalling her inferior
war vessels from the Orient and replacing
them rith stronger ones, but nevertheless
is now spoken of as the third naval power
in the Far East, Russia being the first and
the second being left unnamed. Russia's
course is alluded to sarcastically in the
Japanese press as a splendid policy of ag
gression.
The Eastern World says Russia has
practically turned Japan out of Korea,
and publishes a long article under the
heading, "It Is Political Hypnotism, " de
claring that anything short of hypnotism
of the most powerful order absolutely fails
to explain wny all the world stands with
folded hands, and in helpless apathy
watches the development of the gigantic
plans of Russia for the dominion of the
East.
The guard of sailors at the Russian lega
tion in Korea has just been relieved by a
detachment of eighty Russian infantry.
Twenty cavalry and artillery officers en
tered the town with the infantry. It is
reported that Russia has built a fort on
Getsu-Fito Island, and that a gun is
mounted upon the Russian legation
pointed toward the Japanese consulate.
This makes the ignorant Koreans afraid
of Russia and contemptuous of Japan.
In Tokio recently the chief of the peace
preservation bureau summoned represen
tatives of the entire press to his office and
informed them that if they commented
adversely on the sale of the imperial
mine?, thereby reflecting on the imperial
household, they would be subjected to the
penalties of the press law and proceeded
against under the criminal law also.
The eighth annual meeting of the Red
Cross Society of Japan was held on Mon
day last, there being more than 10,000
visitors present. Her Majesty, the Em
press, was present with a number of court
ladies and the lord steward of her Majes
ty's household. The Empress was re
ceived by the superintendent of the so
ciety. Her Majesty expressed her great
pleasure at the distinguished part taken
by the society during the late Chino-
Japanese war. The Empress bestowed
medals on fifty-one persons before leaving
the hall.
Lieutenant Thurston of the United States
cruiser Detroit died of typhoid fever at
the American Naval Hospital at Yoko
hama, and was buried there with full
naval honors on June 10. A large party of
American bluejackets, the band of the flag
ship Oiympia and a firing squad of marines
were landed to attend the burial. The
French admiral sent his chief of staff and
a number of officers to attend the cere
mony. The American admiral, United
States Consul-General, Vice-Consul and
private citizens were also present. A larpe
number of floral tributes were sent by ship
mates and friends of the deceased. Mr.
Thurston was only 33 years of age.
J. Butler, one of the coal-passers on the
Detroit, died at the American Naval Hos
pital on June 11 and was buried with full
naval honors. His shipmates sent a
number of floral tributes to his grave.
A large number of leading Chinese mer
chants having business at Foochow have
asked the authorities for a gunboat to be
stationed on the Foochow-Formosa
route, which is infested with pirates.
Over thirty trading vessels have been
plundered and their crews murdered and
maltreated. The trouble has assumed a
serious aspect and its immediate suppres
sion is absolutely necessary.
A fresh outbreak of Mohammedans is
reported from Lanchou, the capital of
Kansu. It was believed that the Moham
medan revolt of last year had been com
pletely stamped out, but the rebels are
again under arms and have completely
routed the Government troops sent against
them, nearly 4000 of the latter, out of a
total of 6000, having been killed. The
Viceroys Liv and Chang have been or
dered to send strong re-enforcements.
SUICIDE OF A NAPA BUTCHER.
William K. Craadock Enda Hia Life
With a Itull't.
NAPA, Cal., July I.â William R. Crad
dock, aged 47 years, an honored citizen of
Napa, committed suicide this morning at
the Palace Hotel by shooting himself.
He entered bis room about 7 o'clock this
morning, and nothing more was heard of
him until this noon, when Sherwood Bird,
the proprietor of the hotel, went to the
room to arouse him.
Not receiving any response, ho went to
the porch and looked through the win
dow. To his astonishment, Craddock was
seen lying on the bed dead. The door wa s
immediately opened. It was found that
the man had been dead some time.
He had killed himself by firing a bullet
through his brain, the bullet entering the
right side of his head, just above the ear.
The County Coroner, R. M. Keyser, was
notified and a jury summoned, of which
jury S. M. Pickett was foreman. A ver
dict in accordance with the above facts
was rendered.
When Craddock was found he held a
picture of his mother in one hand and a
pistol in the other. A letter was also found
directed to Herbert W. Shaw, in which
were directions for the disposal of his
property. In reference to the motive for
committing suicide he says in the letter:
I do this on account of melancholy, having
lostali my friends (and for what reason I dou't
know). I have tried to treat everybody well,
but they don't appreciate it.
For the past ten years Mr. Craddock
has been the employ of Zollner & Even,
butchers of Nana. "He was highly re
spected and had many friends, who are
grieved at his sad death.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JULY 2, 1896.
RAILWAY CHANGE
AT LOS ANGELES,
Creditors Assume Control
of the Mount Lowe
Road.
SURPRISE TO CITIZENS.
The Picturesque Mountain Re
sort Line is Temporarily
Embarrassei
TRUSTEES ARE APPOINTED.
They Will Reduce Expenses and Put
a Good Railroad Man in
Charge.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., July I.â People
here were greatly surprised to-day to learn
that the creditors of the Mount Lowe Rail
way Company had taken control of that
picturesque and famous mountain resort
road. The company has a floating debt of
176,000. Of this, $3500 is due employes.
An amicable arrangement has been en
tered into which will secure creditors with
out interrupting the operation of the road
or imvolving the company in expensive
litigation. T. S. C. Lowe, originator of the
Mount Lowe railway, and the man who*e
untiring energy carried the great under
taking to completion, will continue as
president of the company.
The semi-annual interest on the bonds
tell due to-day and the company had no
money .with which to pay. The trustees
expect, however, to provide for this within
ninety days.
A meeting of creditors to the amount of
$38,000 was held yesterday. After hearing
the committee's report Mr. Baker of the
iron works, Mr. Johnson and I. B. New
ton, treasurer of Harper- Reynolds Com
pany, were chosen as trustees for all the
creditors, with power to act.
The trustees then drew up a contract
between the Mount Lowe Railway and the
trustees, whereby it was agreed that as
soon as the trustees should obtain consent
and authority of 90 per cent of the credi
tors, the company would cause three of its
directors to resign and trustees should be
elected in their stead. As there are five
directors in the board this arrangement
will give to the trustees the controlling
vote. The contract was signed yesterday
by the Mount Lowe Railway Company
and creditors to the amount of $28,000 have
ratified it. No oi position to the plan has
developed and every creditor thus far seen
by Mr. Baker has signed the agreement.
The trustees will operate the property, re
ducing expenses and putting some good
railway man in charge.

AN EDITORIAL OUTING.
Southern California Journalist,, Wilt
Viait Santn Catalina liland,
LOS ANGELES, Cal., July I.â The
executive committee of the Boutheru Cali
fornia Editorial Association has just per
fected plans for the summer's session and
onting, which will take place at Santa
Catalina Island July 25 to 27 inclu>ive.
The arrangements for tins three days'
outing and session will include a yachting
trip around the island, boating, fishing
hunting and tally-ho rides among the
mountains.
The membership of the association is
now about 100, nearly all of them success
ful country editors. These, with -their
wives, sweethearts and invited guests, will
comprise one of,the merriest parties which
ever went on an outing in Southern Cali
fornia. The committee has hit upon one
of the most delightful spots in the State
for toe meeting.
This association of bright and clever
newspaper men and wemen have two
meetings every winter and snmnier.
The summer meetings, owing to the su
perb climate, have always been largely at
tended and most successful. It is really
time for the annual meeting, when new offi
cers are elected for the coming year.
Leading members of the association will
read several papers during the meeting,
some of which will point out many of the
absurdities of California laws regarding
the rights and privileges of newspaper
publishers, and will doubtless form a basis
for some important committee work hav
ing in view much-neede i legislation at the
next session of the California General As
sembly. The question of a uniform rate
lor leeal advertising, now very much de
moralize!, will receive attention. The
discussion which the several papers will
precipitat is expected to be animated and
surchar-ed with considerable spice, since
it is known that several able members have
widely different views on several impor
tant subjects.

SAN DIEGO'S CARNIVAL
The Que^n Has Appointed Her
Maids of Honor and
Attendants.
Aquatic Exercises to Be Held oa the
Anniversary of the Nation's
Birth.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., July 1.-The queen
of San Diego's water carnival, Miss Caro
line Polhamus, has named her suite, as
follows: Maids of honor â Mrs. Lewis
Works, Mrs, Walter S. Young, MiÂ»s Vyne
Bowers, Miss Grace Luce, Mits Coxhead,
Miss Gertrude Gilbert, Miss Pansy Parke
and Miss Ethel Gephart. The attendants
will be: Lewis R. Works, Walter S.
Young, A. C. Barlow, H. E. Parke,
Lieutenant R. H. Noble, Wheeler B liley
and Fred Barber. In addition the queen
will have two flower-girls and two pages,
but they have not yet been selected.
Miss Polhamus is not yet 18, but in de
portment and bearing is a typical Ameri
can queen. She is a beautiful blonde, tall
and rounded, with a glow of health in her
cheeks. With her sisters, all athletic girls,
Miss Polhamus organized the Zlac Rowing
Club, the first girls' club in this portion of
the State. The success of thecluband the
notice given to the young maids who com
posed it, led to the organization of six
other clubs of young women, all of which
are prospering.
The barge which will be occupied by the
queen and her attendants has been
specially constructed for the occasion. The
plans contemplate a double deck, with
stairs leading to the throne on the upper
one. In the center of the seats provided
for her attendants is being constructed a
large raised chair, which will serve the
purpose of a throne, and on the deck
below will be stationed the City Guard
band of thirty piece!*.
The barge "will be elaborately decorated
with bunting, and several flagstaffs wili
fly the stars and stripes. Several hundred
colored electric lights will illuminate it,
and in addition there will be a free use of
calcium lights, making the spectacle one
of dazzling brilliancy. The electric lights
will be manufactured on the barge. The
queen will be attired in a white satin full
couit dress, and will wear jewels and a
crown of dazzling splendor.
Â£One of the most interesting events on the
proeramme of aquatic sports next Satur
day will be a trial of skill between Judge
A. D. Jordan and Louis Almgren. Alni
gren will impersonate a fish, and will pre
tend to be hooked and try to get away.
Jordan is allowed 300 feet of line, and
must bring Almgren to the float in twenty
minutes' time, after allowing him to reel
out 100 feet of the line.
Almgren weighs about 150 pounds and
will no doubt give Jordan some hard
work. The line is attached to a ring
sewed in a harness worn by the swimmer
and the swimmer is allowed to swim under
the steamship wharf, if he can get that
faraway, and use any expedient he may
desire to break the line. He cannot, how
ever, use either hands or feet to catch or
hold on to any object. The experiment is
designed to show the skill and strength of
an expert angler. The following is the
official programme of the Fourth of July
celebration:
July 3â Evening. Illuminated bicycle
parade, 800 wheels in line.
July 4â Forenoon. Sunrise salnte of
forty-six guns by Naval Battalion on

FORGERY IS HINTED AT.
A Receipt Only the Signature to
Which Is Declared to Be
Genuine.
THE PAYMASTER'S DEFENSE.
Claims That He Accepted the Money
From Clerk Tobin Simply
as a Loan.
VALLEJO, Cal., July I.â ln the court
martial of Paymaster Webster, charged
with having exacted a cash bond of $2500
from W. J. Tobin before giving him em
ployment as a clerk, and afterward failing
to return the money, much time was spent
this m ming listening to a brilliant argu
ment by Judge Advocate Laucheimer as
to the advisability of listening to testi
mony the prosecution desired to be intro
duced by Medical Inspector George W.
Woods, and which had been ruled out yes
terday afternoon as being inadmissible on
account of it being o~!y hearsay evidence.
The court was cleared for consultation,
and on opening the doors the president
announced that it had been decided to hear
the testimony.
Medical Inspector Woods was called to
the stand and detailed an interview held
with Mrs. Tobin prior to her death, in
which he (Dr. Woods) had informed
her that it was not within the prov
ince of an officer in the navy to re
quire a bond from a clerk under him, and
if such a one had been given it was con
trary to law. It is claimed by the pay
master that the money received was not
exacted as a bond. The receipt given to
her reads:
Vallejoâ Received of Mrg. Katharine Tobin
the sum of $2500 on account of deposit for W.
J. Tobin. E. B. Webster.
The defense will claim that tho money
received was simply as a loan, to be re
turned when called for; that no demand
had been made upon the paymaster for
the return of the full amount of the
money; that while the gunboat Yorktown
was lying in Shanghai Tobin gayÂ« him a
receipt for $583 54, and to substantiate
this evidence the receipt for the money
was produced in court at the session this
afternoon by the attorney for the defense.
The receipt reads:
Shanghai, China, August 10, 1895.
Received from E. B. Webster the sum of five
hundred and eighty-three dollars and fifty,
four cents ($583 54), U. 8. gold coin, on ac
count of loan. w. J. Tobin.
The receipt was not allowed to be intro
duced at the court of inquiry, but the
higher court in session admitted the same
1 and Assistant Paymaster Philip V. Mohun
of the Bennington testified to its being in
the handwriting of Tobin, who has con
tended all along that he had never received
any money back from Paymaster Web- |
ster.
On the evidence of this receipt Paymas

receipt was not in the handwriting of
Tobin.
This turn of affairs was entirely un
looked for by Paymaster W bster and his
attorneys, who immediately arose and
asked for a continuance until 10 o'clock
to-morrow morning to gain additional evi
dence regarding the handwriting of Mr.
Tobin, as they assert most positively that
the entire document was written by Mr.
Tobin himself.
The court was cleared for deliberation
on the question of continuance until 10
o'clock to-morrow morning to allow other
expert testimony on the handwriting of
Tobin to be introduced. After some little
time the doors were thrown open and the
jud :e advocate having nrÂ» objections the
court was adjourned until 10 o'clock to

of witnesses wili be cal!ed to identify the
writing on the receipt.

genuine throughout.
Had not the witness Levy testified as he
did the defense would have closed their

then the case would have been closed. It
is possible that the court will have com

PARKER JURY DISAGREES
Stood F even to Five in Favor oi
Upholding the Contested
Will.
Judge Reyno'ds Expresses Regret at
the Situationâ The Case Will
Be Retried.
SAN JOSE, Cal., July I.â The trial of
the contest of the will of George H. Parker
which occupied seven weeks was con
cluded to-day. The argument to the jury
was finished in the forenoon, Judge Rey
nolds instructed the jury, and gave the
case to them for deliberation upon a
verdict at 12:15 o'clock. They remained
out till nearly 6 o'clock when Judge
Reynolds called them into the courtroom.
At that time the foreman of the jury,
William Ross, stated that no agreement
had yet been reached. After a meal the
jury retired again.
At 8:30 o'clock they came into the court
room and asked for instructions as to a
codicil. It was desired to know what
would be the effect if one of the codicils
was annulled. The court stated that no
instructions could be eiven on this point,
and the jury again retired.
At 11 o'clock to-night the jury again
came into the court-room and the foreman
announced that it was impossible to agree.
They stood seven to five to uphold the will.
Judge Reynolds then discharged the
jury, at the same time expressing much
regret at the situation. Reference was
made by the court to the very long and
expensive trial,, but as the jurois seemed
to coincide in the opinion that they could
not agree there appeared to be nothing
for it to do but discharee them.
The side of the contestant, who de
manded the jury, had to pay $624 jury
fees. The case will be retried. Attorneys
V. R. Paterson, J. Cooganand N. Bowden
represented the contestant, and D. M.
Delraas, F. E. Spencer and D. W. Burchard
were attorneys for the respondents.

PERALTA-REAVIS
FOUND GUILTY.
Convicted of Perjury in the
Famous Land Grant
Case.
SENTENCE WITHHELD.
It a New Trial Is Refused the
Matter Will Be Ap
pealed.
FORGED DEEDS WEEE FILED.
Witnesses Who Swore They Had
Previously Lied in the Defend
ant's Behalf.
SANTA FE, N. M., July 1.-Tbe case oi
the United States vs. J. A. Peralta-Reavis,
on indictments charging conspiracy to de
fraud the United States out of 12,000,000
acres of land, was given to the jury last
evening. A verdict of "guilty as charge I"
was returned at 9 o'clock this morning.
Judge Laughlin withheld sentence until
the 18th inst. A motion for a new trial
and an arrest of judgment will be made,
and , if refused, an appeal will be taken.
The features of the trial were the con
fessions of A. E. Sherwood, Jose Ramon
Valencia and Andreas Sandoval of Call*
fornia, that the evidence they had for
merly given in support of the pretended
"Peralta" grant was false. Valencia con
fessed on the witness-stand that he was
induced by promises of money to testify
as he did regarding the parentage and
youth of Mrs. Reavis; that ho knew
nothing about the facts. The testimony
of Joseph Sherwood, brother of A. E.
Sherwood, brought out the fact that John
A. Treadway, alleged to have brought up
Mrs. Reavis, died in 1861, before Mr*.
Reavis is supposed to have been born.
The perjuries spoken of are alleged to
have been committed in the examination
before United Btates Commissioner Hough
ton, in this city, in October, 1890. A dozen
witnesses testified in favor of tho fraudu
lent claimants to some 13,000,000 acres of
land in this State.
The history of the litigation and the at
tending conspiracy is an interesting one.
In October, 1892, James Addison Peralta-
Reavis and Loreto Micaria de Peralta-
Reavis, his wife, sued in the Court of Pri
vate Land Claims for confirmation of a
grant alleged to have been made by Spain
in 1758 to ona Miguel Peralta, baron of
Arizona, knight of the Colorados and
grandee of Spain, covering 12,740,000 acres
of land in Arizona and New Mexico. This
claim included the sites on which the city
of Phoenix and other large places in Ari
| zona now stand. The title to the land had
j been investigated by eminent counsel and
I pronounced genuine. As a result many
persons and a few corporations acquired
interests in the Territory claimed as pur
chasers from the plaintiffs.
It was alleged that the original grant
j had been recommended by Phillip V of
i Spain in 1744 and by Ferdinand VI |n
J 1748; that it had been actually allowed by
| the Viceroy of New Spain in 1748 and rati
fied some time later; but the Federal
authorities made a thorough investigation
of the claim, and the result was the un
earthing of a great mass of fraud. From a
search of the archives of Spain and Mexico
it was found that the instruments of which
the copies were correct and duly authenti
cated were cleverly forced on genuine
ancient parchments, from which other
writings had been skilltully erased and
placed among tho records attending tne
administration of Government affairs in
California and adjacent territory during
the period of Spanish dominion.MANY THOUSANDS

full particulars reach Tokio of the cruel
disaster that has overtaken the people
living along the coast of Rikuzen and
Rikuchu. At intervals, happily long,
Japan is visited by earthquake waves
which devastate her shores and sometimes
bury whole villages permanently under
the sea. Traveling by boat from Kanazawa
to Kamakura, for example, one passes
over a spot once crowded with habitations,
of which no trace whatever can be seen
tnrough the clear water.
Between 8 and 8:20 p. m. on June 15 a
violent seismic disturbance stirred the
ocean which bathes the northeastern
coast of the main island. Accounts
thuÃ far received place the center of dis
turbance in the vicinity of the celebrated
island of Kinkwa-Zan, but that idea re
quires verification.
Between Kinkwa-Zan on the south and
Hachinoye on the north, a distance of
about 170 miles, practically the whole
coast was swept by the wave, and as at the
times of tne disasters occurring at Minato
on the extreme north of devastated Lit
toral and Kinkwa-Zan on the south, differ
by only 30 minutes at moat, it is scarcely
conceivable that the genesis of the dis
turbance can have been in the neighbor
hood of the latter place. Such velocity ia
out of question. Another fact militating
against the supposition that Kinkwa-Zan '
was the center of the seismic energy is
that the shock was barely felt at Sendai,
â¢which is only thirty-three miles from
Kinkwa-Zan.
What seems more probable is that the
sesmic force bad its origin a good deal
further north than the Kinkwa-Zan coast,
and the direction of the force being north
ward, only the convex of Littoral, be
tween Kinkwa-Zan and Hachino-Ye, was
struck by the waves. Following the coast
line northward from Kinkwa-Zan we find
these reports from various places on the
beach :
Onogawa, Futahamaâ Lives lost, ani
mals destroyed and houses inundated, but
no definite number stated.
Washigamiâ Forty houses destroyed;
several deaths.
Okatsu â Fifty persons killed ; thirty
houses washed away; prison doors thrown
open, but several prisoners supposed lost
as well as some of the warders; a quantity
of mail matter swept away.
Motoyoshi (or Shizukawa) â Eighty
houses swept away; seventy-two corpses
recovered up to 1 p. m. on the 16th.
Kamaishiâ Over half the town awept
away; many persons and animals killed;
telegraph office washed away.
Miyako â Much injury to life and prop
erty. Kuji â Ditto.
Hachinoye-Minato â Eleven persons
killed, two missing; school-building de
stroyed; bridges swept away.
Hashikami Mura â Bulidines swept
away, 300; deaths, 400; wounded, 100.
Quani Mura, Motoyashi district â Ninety
buildings swept away; deaths, 400.
Koidz.umi-Murad â Deaths, 1450.
Utatsu-Mura, Motoyoshi district â Build
ings swept away, 600, there being abso
lutely nothing left; deaths, 600; wounded,
250.
Okachihama, Momo district-Buildings
swept away, 40; deaths, 31; wounded 5.
Among those who lost their Jives at Oka
chihama were 8 jailers and 7 prisoners.
Neinuro â Feeble shocks of earthquake
continued all day; inhabitants very anx
ious, anticipating another disaster.
Sendaiâ ln the three districts of Motoyo
shi, Ojika and Momo. in Miyagi prelec
ture, the most disastrous damage done by
the tidal wave was during the night of the
15th inst. According to the report of tiie
authorities of the district of Motoyoshi
alone the deaths were 1030 and the build
ings washed away 560.
Morioka, June 17.â During the night
of the 15th inst. there were repeated earth
quases. The eastern coast of Iwate Ken
was washed by a tidal wave. The damage
done was sad beyond description. The
worst was experienced in the three towns
of Kamaishi, Miyaho and Sakari.
Aonioriâ All employes of the telegraph
office at Kohiro-Hama were drowned by
the tidal wave. The office at Yamada was
swept away.
From the Governor of Iwateken, June
17. â By the tidal wave of the night of the
15tn the number of persons who either
lost their lives or were injured is 2000 at
Sakarimachi, Kesen district. Excepting
the bluff of Kamaishi, the whole town was
completely swept away.
Sapporo, June 17. â The tidal wave the
! night of the 15th swept along the whole
i coast of Sapporo. Along the road from
Sapporo to Surumura eight deaths oc
i curred and eight buildings were destroyed.
I Four sampans are missing and three are
I wrecked.
Sendai, June 16.â The whole eastern
coast of this prefecture (Miyagi Ken) was
was washed by the tidal wave at 8 p. m. of
the 15th. A number of houses were swept
away and a heavy deathroll in antici
pated.
Mivadzueawa Motoyoshi district â More
than seventy houses were carried away,
involving the death of over seventy peo
ple. The Governor and police inspectors
are now making diligent investigations.
Sendai â The tidal wave devastated the
districts of Ojika and Motoyoshi this
morning. About 500 houses were washed
away and 1000 people drowned. The Gov
ernor, police inspectors and other officials
have hurried to the spot.
Aomonâ The tidal wave swept Shiro
gane, in the JUinato-Mura Sannobe dis
trict, at 8 o'clock last night. Many build
ings, including one school, were washed
away and three persons drowned and two
are missing. Many boats and fishing im
plements were destroyed. Two neavy
earthquake shocks were felt last night and
this morning. There were thirty feebl*
earthquakes.
Akitad, June 16. â Repeated earth
quakes felt here during the night.
Seoul, June 16. â An insurrection has
broken out in Chung-Chong-Do. One regi
ment of royal guards, with Russian
officers, was dispatched to that district
to-day.
Kobe, June 15. â The steamer Kawa
noura Maru collided with and sank the
Hozui Maru oft Hiroshima, 178 lives being
lost.
Some accounts speak vaguely of thou
sands of lives lost and 500 houses swept
away on the coast of Ojika and Motoyoshi
alone, but that seems to be an exaggera
tion. There does not appear to have been
an earthquake of injurious force. One
statement is to the effect that thirteen
ihocke were felt in the neighborhood of
Ishimaki, but they must have been com
paratively slieht. 'Undoubtedly there has
been lamentable loss of life and property,
ana doubtless large tracts of rice fields
have been inundated and destroyed.
The latest dispatches in regard to the
earthquake in the northern part of Japan
give the loss of life at 30,000, thus multi
plying the first returns by thirty. There
is but little room to doubt that the true
number far exceeds fhe last estimate, and
that it will in all probability double if not
treble it.
The news is as yet very meager, tele

tated district being cut off for most part.

lation live on the lowlands along the sea
coast, and so were involved in the rush of
the tidal wave which followed the land
disturbance and sweot Doth sides of the
islands of NiDhon and Yezo for more than
150 mile north and south of the Tsagam
Straits.
This pari. of Japan, according to Profes
sor John Milne, who has been a resident
of that country for years and has given
much time and attention to the study of
seismic disturbances, is more subject to
earthquakes than the southern part of the
islands. There is an average of over
three per day during some years, and in
1880 there were as many as 1200 distinct
shocks reported and recorded.
The tidal wave, which in this instance
seems to have caused the most destruc
tion, doe? not always accompany the land
disturbance to a degree that brings it to
notice either in Japan or elsewhere. Out
of 15,000 earthquakes observed on coast
lines only 124 were accompanied by large
waves, and of 1098 recorded on the west
coast of South America only 19 are said to
have been accompanied by movements of
the sea. Until late years no accurate in
formation bus been gathered in regard to
earthquakes in Japan, but many instances
pretty well authenticated lead to the con
clusion that destructive tidal waves have
j been more or less frequent in the region
just visited.
On the occasion of the great earthquake
of 1737, whose effects ranged from Yezo to
the northern part of Kamtchatka, the
tidal wave, according to Fuchs, broke
over the coast at Cape Lopatka to a height
of 210 feet. That the sea disturbance was
very intense in this instance is shown by
the fact that the tidal wave came all the
way across the Pacific, more than 6000
miles, to the harbor of Acapulco, though
no indications of it were noted in this
harbor.
Tbis tidal wave and the later accounts
of the disaster indicate that the focus of
the commotion was on the Pacific side of
the islands, instead of the other, as at
first thought, and this is in accord with
previous observations by Professor Milne
and others, who have shown that by far
' the greater number of shocks originate
on the eastern side of the islands or the
adjoining ocean. The exception is for a
shock to come from the west side.
The accompanying map, which shows
the elevated position shaded and the low
land in white, will give some idea of the
extent of country subjected to the worst
effects of the land disturbance as well as
the overwhelming of the sea waves.
Tne town of Kamaishi on the north
western coast of Nippon, reported as
utterly destroyed in this instance, has
been the center of destruction on former
occasions, and there is every reason to be
lieve that the whole low country along the
coast, from there to Kumashiri in the
northern part of the Island of Yezo, has
been swept by the inrush of the sea, and
that both sides of Tsugaru Straits and the
west coast of the islands north and south
have been also subjected to the violent
and destructve effect!* of the disturbed
waters. These low parts along the coast
are lined with towns and villages which
are for the most part entirely cut off from
any means of quicK communication.
The town of Aomori, on tne bay of the
same name, opening into Tsugaru Straits,
is the northern terminus of railroad com
munication with Tokio. It has cable con
nection with Hakodate, in the Hakkaido
mininz region of Yezo, but only by an oc
casional vessel with other towns along the
coast.
It is more than probable that the full
extent of the loss of life will not be known
for some time yet and that it will be ap
palling.

THE TAX LEVY
AND THE CHARTER
Discussed by the Asso
ciated Improvement
Clubs.
HOW TO CUT EXPENSES.
A Special Committee Make a
Thorough Study of the
Matter.
SUPERVISOR TAYLOR EXPLAINS
Says Vicious Legislation and Not
Men Is the Cause of the
Trouble.
The Associated Improvement Clubs met
last night in full delegation and discussed
with much animation and force the ques
tion of the tax levy and the proposed
new charter. An elaborate report of the
former subject, prepared by the commit
tee especially appointed, was read, aud,
on invitation, a reply was made to this by
Supervisor Taylor, chairman of the Fi
nance Committee.
The Committee on Parks and Streets
recommended the purchasing of the old
Jewish Cemetery property for a park, pro
viding the price be not too exorbitant;
also the placing of a sustaining wall along
the western side of Buena Vista Park.
The Committee on Public Utilities advo
cated the placing of arc lights in Golden
Gate Park, the expense to be liquidated
by special appropriation, and the light to
be furnished by a plant to be placed in the
park.
The committee on the tax levy re
ported that it had made a thorough study
of a printed list of expenses furnished it by
the Finance Committee of the Supervisors
and cited to the meeting how a saving of
$350,000 in total might be effected. Salaries
they believed should be greatly reduced,
as well as the expense of cleaning the City
Hall. The committee further advocated
abolishing the offices of Fish and Game
Warden.
At the conclusion of this report Presi
dent Phelan asked of Mr. T aylor, "How
do these figures strike you?"
"I have been parnlyzed," replied Mr.
Taylor, "by figures for some days." He
then said that, although there were many
valuable points mentioned in the report,
there were others that were overlooked.
"Vicious legislation, 7 ' said he, "is the
cause of all' our trouble. The Supreme
Court has saM that salaries must be paid,
and the men who bid for contracts for
supplies will be the losers.
"If the Supervisors are not permitted to
allow the paying of salaries it will cause
the depletion pi the general fund."
Dr. Rottanzi, as chairman of the Public
buildings and works committee, advocated
the placing of the Pesthouse on some site
rem ote from any community.
The high school committee recom
mended that a high school class be placed
in some already established school build
ing in the Mission.
There followed 'a heated discussion re
garding the passage of the "rattler test"
ordinance for street-paving rock.
A special committee, consisting of Ellis,
Hubbs and Van Duzer, was appointed to
wait upon the Supervisors on tnis proposi
tion, including aÂ» it does the merits of red
rock and blue rock for paving purposes.
President Dohrmann of the Mercfiants'
Association then addressed the club on
the new charter. He recounted the his
tory of the instrument, and said that above
all things it appealed to the people as
something clean and honeat.
Secretary Freud of the Merchants' Asso
ciation then followed us follows:
1. Legislative Tyranny v?. Home Rale.âUn
der the consolidation act San Francisco has
been and is largely governed by the Legisla
ture Â«nd Governor of the .State. Under the
new charter there will result municipal sover
eignty, independence end home rule.
The new charter will restore self-government
to San Francisco in the following notable in
stances:
(o) The Police Commissioners will no longer
be appointed by the Governor or hold office for
life. The Mayor will appoint four Police Com
missioners. Tneir term will be limited to four
yearb, one retiring each year. No; more than
two CommiHsioners cun be of the same politi
cal party. All policemen who are in the Police
Department when the charter goes into effect
will be retained.
(6) The Fire Commissioners will no longer be
partly appointed by the Governor. The Mayor
will appoint four Fire Commissioners for four
years, one retiring each year. Not more than
two of the same political party. The Fire l>e
partment will be fully paid and equipped.
(c) Election Commissioners.â The present
defective system of creating the Elec
tion Commissioners and the Registrar of
Voters, all ol whom may belong to
the same party, will be abolished.
Four Election Commissioners, not more than
two of the same political party, will be ap
pointed by the Mayor for four years, one re
tiring each year. They will appoint the Regis
trar. Tborougn provisions are made to secure
proper registration of electors and safe and
prompt count of tne votes polled.
(d) Board of Health.â The present partisan
method of appointing four members of the
Board of Health for five years will be abolished.
Three regular physiciane, eight years residents
of the City, will be appointed by the May6r
for two-year terms as the Board of Health.
2. Official Chaos vs. Fixed Authority.â Under
the present consolidation act officials shirk
and shift their responsibility. The municipal
government is therefore uncertain and cha
otic. The new charter places accountable au
thority and fixed responsibility in every
municipal department.
(a) The Mayor.â Year by year the powers of
the Mayor have been usurped by the Legisla
ture and the Supervisors under the consolida
tion act. He has therefore become a mere
figurehead and cipher in the City government.
Under the new charter, however, he will be
vested with executive power and official re
sponsibility. He will be accountable for the
conduct of the City government, as weli as its
officials. The objection most frequently raised
against the charter is the claim that it confers
exorbitant powers upon the Mayor. Let us see
exactly what are the j)owers of the Mayor
under the new charter. He will appoint the
City Attorney, Public Administrator, Board of
Public Works, Park Commissioners, Library
Trustees, Police Commistioners, Fire Commis
sioners, Board of Health, Election Commis
sioners and Civil Service Commissioners. All
other officials of the City will remain
elective under the constitution and gen
eral laws of the State. Until such
time aa the constitution shall have been
changed by the people all other officials will
therefore be elected by the people as hereto
fore, with the exception of the Superintendent
of Streets and Surveyor, who are abolished
under the churter. Examining, theretore, the
list of appointees of the Mayor, it will readily
appear that the Mayor under the charter will
appoint but two officials who are at present
elected by the poople. These two officials are
tho City Attorney aud the Public Administra
tor. All the other Commissioners and trus
tees appointed by the Mayor are now either
appointed by the Governor or hold office for
life or are newly created. Therefore, the peo
ple are not deprived of their privilege of elect
ing officials, as at present, except in the case of
the City Attorney and Public Administrator.
While the Mayor who is in office when the
charter goes into effect will appoint all these
Commissioners, subsequent Mayors will ap
point but two of them, as they go out of office
in rotation and the term of the Mayor is lim
ited to two years.
3. Political Patronage vs. Civil Service.â The
consolidation act is the boon of political
patronage and unscrupulous political' bosses.
The new charter will eradicate political
patronage and annihilate political bosses.
(a) Civil Service. â Under the consolidation
act political patronage rules every depart
ment oi the City government. It create* and
breeds political bosses, the bane of municipal
progress and prosperity. It produces incom
petency, dishonesty and corruption. With
the new charter, however, will come a thor
ough system of civil service. All clerks, em
ployes and laborers in the service of the City
will be governed by civil service rules and
regulations.
(6) Examinations.â Free, public, competitive
examinations of a practical nature must be
taken by all applicants, who must be citizeus
of the United States. Examinations must in
clude physical test** and manual skill wherever
necessary. No question shall relate to politics
or religion.
(c) Appointments, Dismissals and Promo
tions.âOut of the three highest in the civil
service list the appointee must be selected.
The appointment will therefore depend upon
ability and merit, and never upon politics.
No dismissal can be made for any reason ex
cept dishonesty, inefficiency, insubordination
or habitual discourtesy, proven after a fair
and impartial trial before the Commissioners.
Promotions will depend upon faithfulness and
length of service.
(d) Salaries â Salaries will be no higher than
are paid for similar services in business
houses, and the City Hall hours will be from
8 :3O a. m. to 5 P. Jf.
(c) Corruption.â Any officer or employe of the
City under the new dinner who promises or
pays anything for his nomination, election or
appointment forfeits his position and is per
manently disqualified from hoMing any
municipal office.
4. Extravagance vs. Economy.â The loose,
jumbled and defective methods of ihe consoli
dation act invite and encourage extravagance
and corruption. The rigid system oi nuance
and revenue in the new charter will necessi
tate honesty and economy.
(a) Tax Levy.â Under the present consolida
tion act the limit of $1 on the $100 of assessa
ble property is completely destroyed. The
result has been exorbitant" rates of taxation.
The tax levy for the fiscal year just closed re
quired a tax rate for City and County
purposes of $ 1 56 on the $100 taxable prop
erty, involving an expenditure of $0,400,000.
The new charter will restore tne tax rate to
within $1 on the $100 and make the limit
$1 07 for City and County purposes. This will
be possible under the provisions of the new
charter.
(b) Finance and Revenue.â The general fund
will be abolished. Twenty-four specific funds
will be provided under the charter. All rev
enue will have to be kept in separate funds
and cannot be tranferred as at present. This
system is a vast improvement upon the pres
ent loose method of raising and spending the
people's money. At present one fund draws
upon another, and when exhausted they all
draw upon the general fund. Appropriations
are therefore made for one purpose and spent
for an entirely different purpose. For exam
ple, $150,000 was appropriated for the past
fiscal year for sweeping and sprinkling the
public streets. As the streets were not sprin
fcled at all by the City, and the sweeping was
curtailed, there was in reality a surplus of
some $30,000 in this fund at the expiration of
the fiscal year. This surplus has been diverted
to other funds and purposes.
(c) Liabilities.â There will be restrictions
upon the liabilities of the City government
under the new charter. Liabilities can never
be incurred in any fiscal year exceeding the
revenue of that year, nor in any mouth exceed
ing one-tweifth of the revenue of the year.
Each expenditure will have to be provided for
in its proper specific fund. No fund can be
exhausted, because the liabilities cannot ex
ceed the appropriations of each specific fund.
5. Decay and Dryrot vs. Progress and Pros
perity.âThe consolidation act has enabled
corporations to enthrall the people, and re
trogression and decay have overtaken the
City. Great public improvements in the
streets, roads, sewers and pavements will re
sult from the new charter.
(a) Public Franchise!-.â The new charter will
allow no exclusive privilege or monopoly in
any franchise for water, gas, electric light,
telegraph, telephone or steam power. Wiihin
one year after the charter takes effect, every
public franchise not in actual use will be iof
?eited to the City. Every public franchisÂ«
hereafter granted must be in operation within
six months from its creation. One year will
be the limit upon any City contract tor gas or
electric light, and the price shall never exceed
the lowest charge to any consumer.
(6) Railway Franchises.â Street-railway fran
chises will be sold to the highest biader, and
at least 2 per cent of the gross receipts will go
to the City. Upon the expiration of street
railway franchises, their roadtntcks and road
beds revert to the City. The new charter em
powers the Board of Supervisors to "tix. estab
lish and reduce the rates of fare upon ail street
railroads in the Ctiy an<i County." All trans
continental or other railroad companies mean
ing business will have free entry into San
Francisco.
(c) Public Improvements.â The charter will
abolish the City Hall Commission and the
offices of Superintendent of Streets and Sur
veyor. Three Commissioners of Public Works
will be appointed for a term of four years, who
will manage and conduct all public* works, re
pairs and improvements. Any contract in
which any person in the Department of Public
Works is interested shall be void. It will no'
be possible to levy assessments upon any prop
erty aggregating over 50 per cent ol its as
sessed valuation. No streets will be allowed
to be torn up by private parties. A thorough
and systematic system of drainage will be
adopted. The public streets will be uniformly
swept, cleaned and sprinkled by the City, giv
ing preference to hand labor and to perma
nent residents. Bonding of the City for neces
sary permanent public improvements will be
valid, safe and certain.
(d) Municipal Ownership.â The charter pro
vides for the permanent acquisition and
municipal ownership by purchase, condemna
tion or construction of water works, pas works,
electric-light works, steam, water or electric,
power works, telephone lines and street rail
roads.
Ninety days before each election the Board
of Public Works must estimate the true value
of street railroads and water works, telephone,
gas and electric-light plants and all public
franchises. These exact estimates will be sub
mitted to the people at the ensuing election by
resolution of nine Supervisors.
Municipal ownership of any public utility
will be acquired by a two-thirds vote of the
people at the estimate established by the
Board of Public Works. Public utilities thus
acquired by the City will be managed and
operated by the Board of Public Works for the
benefit of the entire public.
It was decided to appoint two delegates
from eacb of the individual clubs and five
from the associated body, to attend the
charter convention on August 5.
The meeting was adjourned until two
weeks from last night, when the discus
sion on the charter will be resumed.
READY FOR THE FOURTH.
Socialist Bodies Will Tarn Oat and
Parade in Full Force.
The committee of arrangements of the
Socialist Labor party met last night at
the Turk-street Temple and completed
arrangements for Saturday's demonstra

charge of Grand Marshal Hermann Sah
lender. The column will be headed by a

where it will be reviewed and dismissed
by the grand marshal to afford an oppor
tunity to those participating to attend the
mass-meeting and exercises with which
the socialist party intend to conclude the
day's celebration.
Sierra County's Celebration.
Louis F. Byinzton, a grand officer of the
Native Sons and a memoer of Niantic
Parlor, leaves this morning for Downie
ville, and will be away for about a week.
For years the residents of Sierra County
have been in the habit of celebrating the
National holiday in the towns in their
immediate vicinity, but this year the
people of the different parts of the county,
wishing to surpass all previous events,
have combined to hold a grand general
celebration at Downieville, the county
seat. From the preparations that have
been going on for the last week or two
and the elaborate programme, got up
under the auspices of the three Nati-e Sons
parlors of Sierra County, there is no doubt
that the celebration will be a success. Mr.
Byington, who is a native of Sierra County,
las consented to deliver the oration.
Hew Mining Company.
La Sucrte Gold Mining Company was yester
day incorporated by M. A. Laveaga, Rudolph
Herold Jr., Frederick Hess, L. S. Rose and Alex

of which $5000 has been paid in.

Altgeld is the boss.
New York Democracy is no longer in the

the thing arbitrated. - - â¢ .:
Bland and Boies had better pool their
issues and toss up for first place.

Â»
Populists will not walk into the parlor
of the Democratic spider. They are too
fly.
Country people will find that tbe City
has spread herself for their benefit on the
Fourth. . -
Start the wheels of prosperity moving
and competing roads will flourish all over
California. "Â£" *'
After the Chicago convention is over St.
Louis will have another inning, and it will
be a big one.
Nobody can fool the people this year.
They are going to vote for prosperity all
over the Union.
If Democracy needs any more roasting
Chicago can be relied on to fnrnish the
weather to do it.
In preferring the leadership of Altgeld
to that of Whitney, Democracy shows
what it is made of.
Illinois will determine the fight at Chi
cago and then cast her electoral vote for
the PL Louis ticket.
Chicago will be tne best place in the
Union to skip next week and Monterey
the best place to visit.
The Cleveland administration hurt the
country but did not ruin it. The Glorious
Fourth is still with us.
If David Bennett Hill expects to raise
his head above the crowd at Chicago he
will have to climb a pole.
The only way for Populists to fuse with
Democrats is to leave the middle of the
road and take to the woods.
II the Chicago convention should result
in anarchy. Governor Alteeld can be
counted on to pardon it out.
According to the estimate of The Cail
correspondent who interviewed him, Alt
geld is cunning but not preat.
"A cause worth fighting for is worth
fighting for to the end," is Cleveland's
latest sonorous phrase, but he hasn't ex
plained to what end he is fighting.
The Southern Pacific Company swore it
couldn't, it shouldn't and it wouldn't re
duce freight rates in the Pan Joaquin, but
it did.
What grinds California Democracy is
the increasing evidence that the Illinois
boss is a bigger man than their own
Daggett.
The Democratic promise of a free-trade
boom was a free-trade bust, and their
promise of a free-silver bDora will end the
same way.
The announcement that Reea is to take
the stump for McKinley will surprise
nobody. The stalwarts are always to be
counted on.
Among yoor preparations for the Fourth
of July don't forget to clean up your back
yard and make yourself safe against the
uncertain firecracker.
The heads of the administrative depart
ments at Washington are hastening to
Chicago and Cleveland keeps on saying
nothing about offensive partisanship.
The experience of the past three years
Ehows the industries of this country can
never prosper without protection and,
therefore, the people will vote for protec
tion.
Now that the Southern Pacific has re
duced rates in competition with the Valley
road, the Railroad Commission should see
to it that the rates are made uniform
throughout the State.
The record of McKiniey, like the record
of the Republican party, ia one of true
Americanism, and that is the reason why
the party and the peoplo accept his leader
ship with enthusiasm.
It will be interesting to *atch the Demo
crats straddle tbe tariff issue and dodge
Lthe administration record, while trying to
make a race in a campaign where these!
things will be more talked of than any
thing else.
A DISCREDITED PARTY.
However the Democrats may shout for
free silver and bimetallism at Chicago,
there is little danger that the American
people will trust to their incompetent
hands the great cause of the restoration
of silver to its rightful place as- one of the
money metals of the world. That party
under its present leadership, at any rate,
cannot he trusted on any platform. The
measures which it advocates are not more
discredited than the men who advocate
them. The people will not trust a party
bossed by Altgeld and composed of men
â who will submit to such a boss. What
the country needs now is not only a policy
of good measures, but an administration
of men capable of right government.
It is fortunate for the country at this
juncture that the character of Democracy
and of its favorite leaders is so well under
stood. Without the experience of the last
three years many sincere supporters of
bimetallism would have been tempted to
vote for the Chicago ticket if it declares
for free silver. We have had that experi
ence, however, and no class of people have
forgotten it. It is known that the Demo
cratic party is an unorganizable mass of
discordant factions. It is incapable of
carryine out any policy. It is not only
unfit to govern, but cannot even administer
with success the routine business of Na
tional affairs.
Under these circumstances even the
mo9t ardent silver men will trust the Re
publican pledge to promote bimetallism
by international agreement rather than
Democracy no matter what it promises.
The Republican party can be counted on
to five the country a successful adminis
tration of public business. It will abolish
the deficit tariff. It will provide ample
revenues for the Government. It will re
sume the patriotic task of decreasing the
bonded debt which Democracy has in
, creased. It will protect American indus
try, revive trade and assure to every
workingman employment at good wages.
These things it will do without fail and
when it has done them it will go forward
to the great task of establishing a true
bimetallism without injury to any interest
of the country.
In the great work of statecraft men are
not less important than measures. The
most prosperous commonwealth can be
reduced to bad conditions if the Govern
ment is in the hands of incompetent men
who can do no more than meddle and
muddle. Great men are needed for great
tasks, and in party novernnient there must
be uarmony, organization and discipline
in the ranks and among the leaders, of the
party entrusted with the task of govern
ing. The people have had enough of
Democratic confusion under this adminis
tration, and will not repeat the experi
ment. They will not raise to office on any
platform tne party of such, discordant
elements as Brice and Bland, Whitney
and Altgeld, Gorman and Tilraan. They
will restore to power the party that knows
how to govern and govern rightly, the
party represented by the soldier candidate
McKinley â the party of patriotism, pro
tection and prosperity.
"UNCLE TOM'S CABIN.'
At the ripe old age of So Harriet Beecher
Stowe passed away yesterday. She stood in
the front rank of America's most distin
guished women. But she won her distinc
tion in the cause of human liberty, which
she labored for with subliae heroism. The
great heart of the woman went out in sad
ness yet with determination when she
saw for herself the withered fruits of
slavery, and all its fruits were withered,
she believed. Hence as a humanitarian
Harriet Beecher Stowe will live in bis-
Tory, and what greater legacy could she
have left those who shall follow her foot
steps in the work of righting human
wrongs and ia leading the worid upward
than a life spent in doing good?
There was just such inspiration as is
born of the eternai fitness of things that
prompted Mrs. Stowe to write "Uncle
Tom's Cabin." It was not a work of high
literary merit, and the authoress took the
greatest liberty with what is called the
Doet's and the novel writer's license to
draw upon the wildest imagination to
further intensify situations and environ
ment which surrounds characters pictured
by the brain. According to all the rules
of novel-makine. Mrs. Stowe was justified
in picturing smvery as she did in "Uncle
Tom's Cabin.'
But it so haprened that she had ma
terial facts enough for a true and substan
tial background. It may be said that she
took a picture already finished, but fin
ished in colors that were dark and dull,
and gave it warmth and glow and zeal.
And fortune favored her by laying in her
hands every thread of the social and po
litical fabric wnich destiny had commis
sioned her to unravel, separate and ex
pose. Public opinion was hesitating,
doubting and restless, and a picture of
that which was then in the fullness of ih>
might and strength was needed in colors
that should reveal in lignts and shadows
its inmost soul. Harriet Beecher Stowe un
dertook the work, and "Uncle Tom's
Cabin" was the finished product of her
effort.
MEXICO UNDER DIAZ.
Mexico wili have a Presidential election
next November, but there will not be a
very exciting campaign, for there is but
one candidate, Porfirio Diaz. Diaz was
made President in 1^77 after the manner
of makins Presidents in Mexico in those
dars, and at the expiration of his term in
1830 he visited the United States and
spent some time in studying our political
and economic ways and methods. He
came in a semi-official capacity, being
president of the Judicial Council, which
aided him very much in entering official
circles in this country. In ISM he was
again elected President of the republic,
again in 18S3 and again in 1892. If he
lives to complete his next terra he will
have served as President five terms, fonr
of them being continuous. At his own
suggestion the constitution was amended
during his first term, making it ineligible
for a President to succeed himself, but
after the lapse of one term he would be
eligible. But after Diaz was elected in
1884 h;s administration of the affairs of
the republic being so satisfactory to the
people, the constitution was again
amended so that he might serve two
terms, and just prior to the election in
1892 by a little twisting of the constitution
it was made to mean that President Dial
could serve several more terms.
It would not be fair to say that Porfirio
Diax is the only man in Mexico capable of
being President of the republic, but the
country ha 3 forged ahead so rapidly and
upon such substantial lines under his ad
ministration that there is no disposition
to make a change, and as he is perfectly
willing to stay right on at the head of the
iGoverament. and as he is not quite 66
years old, the chances are that he will
round out hia official life in 1900. No
doubt Mexico would have gone ahead
without the resolute determination of
Diaz to make the country a republic in
fact as well as in name, but it would have
been a slow process interwoven with revo
lutions. When Diaz became President in
1884' Mexico was bat little better than a
THE SAN FRAXCISCQ CALL, THURSDAY, JULY 2, 1896.
great camp of the soldiers of men who had
political ambition, but by degrees they
were quieted down, and meanwhile Diaz
worked hard and succeeded in interesting
foreign capital in mining, railway and
other enterprises, which diverted the at
tention of the people from the thick-flying
pronunciamentoa oi faction leaders.
And now at the end of twelve years of
Continuous rule of President Diaz. Mexico
presents an orderly and industrious front,
with industrial and commercial enter
prises growing in every direction. How
well Europe and the United States know
this to be true is told in the constantly in
creasing output of Mexican home-made
goods and wares and the corresponding
decrease of merchandise imports. All
these years President Diaz has been work
ing Mexico up to where her home indus
tries would furnish a market for the prod
ucts of field and farm. That is to say,
President Diaz adopted the policy in 1884
of turning Mexico into a manufacturine
country, so that only such articles as
could not be made at home would be im
ported. The immense increase in manu
facture, mining, railwa}', commercial and
other wealth-buiiding agencies shows how
well his plans have worked. It is not sur
prising, in view of what has been done to
develop Mexico's resources in the past
dozen years, that the people want to keep
the man who has accomplished so much
at the head of the Nation.
THE ETHICS OF PROTECTION.
It is conceded by every one that it is the
duty of the Government to prevent the in
vasion of the country by objectionable
persons and diseases from other countries.
We object to such intrusion because it
would be hurtful to us. There is nothing
in common between the purpose of our po
litical and social establishments and
whatever is at war with their object.
Therefore whatever measures may be re
quired to protect them against their ene
mies the Government is bound to adopt,
because the Government is the expression
of the wiil of the people collectively.
That is to say, the Government is the
power and the will of the people central
ized, and its authority may be diminished
or increased at the pleasure of the people.
The purpose of the Declaration of Inde
pendence of July 4, 177t3, was to enable the
people to better protect themselves against
invaders of what they conceived to be
their natural rights, and a Government
was formed that there might be a union ot
effort under well-delined regulations.
If it is the duty of a people to Devise
ways and means to prevsnt the invasion
of their homes by men whose presence
would be harmful to the moral sense, and
the invasion of their homes by diseases
that would be harmful in a physical sense,
how is it that some will say that the right
to exclude those thing* which undermine
the home and destroy the product of labor
does not obtain in tue law of self-preserva
tion, which permits the erection of barriers
against moral and physical disease? If
the right obtains in the first instance, it
surely does in the second. All know what
protection against vicious characters and
diseases is for, but it appears there are
some who canuot see tSit there is an inti
mate relation between the consequence
attending the intrusion of hurtful social
and physical enemies and those intrusions
which despoil the product of labor.
The expanding productiveness of the
people of the Orient is reaching this way.
When the sons of China and Japan began
to pour into thiÂ« country we thought little
of it. We now know to our sorrow what a
mistake we made in allowing this invasion
in such droves. But we are being con
fronted by an invasion of all our indus
trial markets by the product of the labor
of a people who are ju>t emerging from
primitive ways, but whose cunning
is quick to see tne advantage to
them which lies in our improved
machinery wnen combined with their
theory that 5 to '20 cents fora day of
twelve hours' work is munificent compen
sation. Already China and Japan are
counting upon a market in foreign lands
that shall make them the industrial
nations of the world, because no nation
whose operatives are not satisfied with a
cup of rice a dty for food and a few cents
a day for wages could compete with them
in an open market. Then ie; us close
our markets.
The people of the United States should
not lose sight of the ethical side of the
â iv.enion of the invasion of our country by
these antagonistic trade and social in
fluences. Protection to our mills and
factories and farms and labor is not all
there is of protection. If our industries
have to yield to the attacks of foreign
industrial enterprises and be placed on a
parity with them we may be sure that our
magnificent free-school Bystem, our church
facilities and our social and home life will
have to yield also that we may conform ia
all things to a power that we have per
mitted to dominate us. There is no com
parison between the standard of living
among the working people of the United
States and the cheap labor countries of the
world. A cup of ricn and 5 to 20 cents a
day is not our way of living, but if we
have to compete with people who do live
that way shall we not have to conform to
their ways and method:-?
BOBS ALTGELD.
The Democratic party has reached the
bottom of the shaft of degradation.
Altgeld has forced the party to decorate
him with the eraulets of supreme boss.
Tee people have been fervently praying
for a long lime for the downfall of the
Democracy, but they did not wiÂ«h to see it
Altgelded to death. Were he such a man
as Hill or Whitney or Cleveland it would
be different, but to be driven like jo many
cattle by a man of Altgeld's dimensions is
lamentably tongh, as bad and wicked as
the party is. Bat it is just r>ossible that
the little l>oss is laying on the party whip
with too much viciousnessand thathemay
work up a revolt. He appears to hare no
respect for persons or principles. He orders
the old-time leaders about as a clown
would his trained animals. So to sj>eak,
he gives delegates to understand that
before they can expect to be recognized
they must call upon him and hare collars
titled to their necks.
There is some excuse, however, for the
way Aitgeld is treating Whitney and his
New York following. Last year Altgeld
asked the leader of the gold win* to attend
his silver convention, which waÂ» to be held
at Springfield, intimating that possibly all
differences could be adjusted and harmony
restored; but Whitney gave Altgeld to
understand that he regarded it an insult
to invite a "sound Democrat" to a gather
ing of silver freak?, wild asses and cross
eyed imbeciles. Of course, Whitney was
not far wrong in his measurement of the
Springneld gathering, but it was not good
politics to express himself so freely.
But anyw.y, Altgeld is running the
party for two purposes. Toe first and
foremost is to elect himself Governor of
Illinois. The second is to humiliat* Cleve
land and his friends end then drive them
out of the party. It appears that Altgeld
rather favors Bland for the nomination,
and it may be true, for the Missourian has
a very large following in Southern Illinois,
or Egrpt, as that part oi Urn Â£tate U
called, and influence and votes in Illinois
are what the little boss wants for his
State ticket. Douglas is fortunate in not
having lived to see the degeneracy of his
party.

MUSIC &
MUSICIANS
The Brazilian papers contain news ot the
death of Carlos Gomes, the only composer from
the New World whose operas have ever held
their own on the Italian stage. 'II Guarany,"
his greatest work, is highly popular in Italy,
aud though the opera is unknown here, its
grand aria, "Ci era una volta un principe,"is
frequently sung by aspiring sopranos. A
Brazilian by birth and origin, Gomes was born
in Campinos in 1839. After studying in his
native land, the Emperor sent him to finish
his musical education in Italy. He went to
Milan and worked assiduously tvith Lauro
Rossi, who was then director oi the Conserva
tory. Gomes made his debut as a composer in
a little scene written on a libretto in the
Milanese dialect "Se sa minga" (one does not
know). A little song in this work about a gun
(it was early in 1967, after the campaign of Sa
dowa) was soon in every one's mouth and the
name of Gomes at once became popular.
In 1870 Gomes gave his first great work,
"II Gunrany," at the Scala, and the opera haa
held its own ever since. Hia second opera,
"Fosca," produced in 1573 at the Scala, made
a colossal fiasco, although Mme. Krauss, Mau
rel and Maini took the principal roles. He
wou success again with "Balvator Rosa" in
1874 and with "Mary Tudor," played at the
Scala in 1879. Although he possessed sterling
talent as a composer Gomes has been re
proached with imitating Verdi, Meyerbeer and
Gounod. The Brazilians were profoundly
proud of their compatriot, who had been the
only composer from this side to win fame in
tbe leading European lyric theaters.
On the request of the Emperor he made a
patriotic hymn, "11 Salnto del Brazil," (Brazil's
Greeting) tor the centenary fetes in Philadel
phia in 187 C, aud the work was pertormed in
that town with considerable success. Last year
Gomes refused to become director of the Musi
cal Conservatory of Pesaro, a position which
has B ince been accepted by Mascagni. He ac
cepted the position of director of the con
servatory of Para, which was offered him at
tbe same time. He was already failing in
he&ltn, however, and when he set out from
Italy to Braxil was obliged to delay bis jour
ney at Lisbon. At last he embarked, in spite
of the doctors' advice, but hardly had he ar
rived at Para than hia malady, which Lad
made rapid strides durinz the voyage, carried
him off in a few days.
The town of Arras, in Franco, has decided to
erect a monument to one vf its most famous
citizens, whose memory is lecoming obscured
In the mists of time. In his day he was &
famous troubadour, poet and musician, and is
still considered as one of the fathers
of the French theater and as the in
ventor of opera-comiqiie. This is A<Jam de la
Halle, known to history aa "The Hunchback of
Arras," although he was a well-formed man.
Adam was the author of a great number of
songs, rounds, motets and pastorals which
were full of grace, and lor which he wrote the
verses as well as the music. One of his little
scenic poems. 'Le Jeu d'Adam" (The Play of
Adam), is considered to be tne oldest French
comedy in existence, while another, "The Play
of Robin and of Marion," is the primitive and
rudimentary tyue of modern opera-comique,
although it takes us back a distance of GOO
years, to the end of the thirteenth century,
since Adam de la Halle died in l'_-
Jfaples, ivhither he had followed the fortunes
of Charles of Anjou. A committee has been
formed in Paris for the purpose of raising
funds for the monument, and on the 21st of
June a grand performance was given in the
theater of Arras, at which the existing works
of Adam were performed by artistes from the
Opera Comique, the Ccmedie Francaise, etc.,
and by this means a large sum was raised to
ward the monument fund.

for classical mutic in Athens. Samara intend!
I to have a grand symphony orchestra oi a hun

ready recruiting in Italy and France. He will
take up bis abode in Athens next December,
with the intention of directing his orchestra
and devoting the rest of his life to advancing
the musical interests of his native land. Early
next year he hopes to augment his orchestra
with a grand chorus.
"It appears," says Le Menestre'., "that the
instruction is not always extremely brilliant
in the Classes at the Conservatory in the City
of Mexico. At present they are citing the case
of a young singer, who alter having obtained
| the first prize as the result of seven years'
| study, was sent to Italy for a few finishing les
sons, and was obliged to recommence her mu
sical education entirely. On account of such
things aa this, the music-lovers of the Mexican
capital are about to establish a rival conserva
tory to the official one, where musical education
will be gratuitous and where the results will
be more appreciable than in the case of the ex
isting institution. At present there exist in
the City oi Mexico three quartet societies,
whose concerts form the delight cf amateurs.
There are the Conservatory Quartet, the Saloma
Quartet and that of the Philharmonic Society,
which is said to be the best."
The barytone, La*seUe. has bidden adieu to
the stage to devote himself to commerce, and
now it appears that the tenor Tamagno is
about to abandon the scene of his triumphs to
spend the rest oi his days in farming. At least
a Montevideo newspaper, L'ltalia a Piata,
gives that news in the following terms: "Ac
cording to statements gathered from Tam
agno s owa mouth, this great tenor liasde
cided to purchase an estate in the Argentina
in order to devote himself to agriculture and
establish himself permanently in the country
that has showered so many honors upon him.
In fact, he is filled with enthusiasm for the
Argentine Republic and for its rulers, among
whom he counts many sincere friends."
Mme. Norman Neruda (Lady Halle), the
violinist, has just celebrated the fiftieth
anuiversarv of her first public appearance and
[the twenty-fifth of her English debut. A conp
mittee. with the Prince of Wales as president,
was formed to offer her a j obilee present, and
so large were the subscriptions that the com
mittee was able to purchase a castle and Its
dependencies near Trevise and to furnish it.
The title deeds of the estate were presented to
Lfldy Halle in a superb case, which con
tained also a little check for Â£500, the
residue of the snm realized by the committee.
I Tne popular artist has not yet laid down her
bow, and if sbe goes on it will be interesting
to see what will be presented to her in another
ten rears.
A young composer of great promise, Miss
Antoinette Untersteiner, has just died at
Milan. She was born at Constantinople, of an
Italian family, in spite of the German form of
her name, and received her musical educa
tion at tbe Milan Conservatory. She waa a
distinguished pianiste, but gave herself up
with ardor to composition. Among other
works she wrote a dramatic scene, "Sul Bal
tico," and a symphonic poem entitled "God
and Satan." At the time of her death she was
working on an opera. Tbe young lady's pre
mature end is deeply regretted, as sne was
considered one of the most promising of the
new female composers.
Rosario Termini, a popular Italian tenor,
has been assassinated in Palermo. As he was
driving home at night from the tneater, and
hod reached the end of Liberty street, near
the Villa Cuccia, four pistol shots were heard
out of the darkness. The tenor fell, struck to
the heart, and died a few minutes after. Up to
the present no trace of the murderer has been
discovered, and the police are ignorant of the
cause ot the crime, though it is believed to
have been an act of personal vengeance.
Henri Cain, Mme. Calves fiance, continues
to distinguish himself, both as painter and
librettist. Massenet's "Cinderella," for which
be has written the book, is about to be put into
rehearsal at the Opera Oomique, Paris, and he
has just been awarded a medal at the Salon
for his painting, "St. George and the Dragon."

A TRAVELING COSTUME.
Tailor effects are always to the front for
traveling costumes, and the Norfolk jacket is
a favorite model. Cheviots, tweeds, serges
and the novelty wools are used for these ser
viceable gowns that are appropriate for general
wear as well as for traveling.
The waist shown here ha* a fitted lining, the
goods being fitted by the pleats. The sleeves
are of the leg-o'-mutton shape, of generous
proportions. The skirt, cut with a circular
front and two gores in the back, which are laid
in box-pleats. The only stiffening used now is
a band from fire to ten inches deep all around
the Dottom. Haircloth wears best, but canvas,
wireine and many other substances are used.
Mixed woolen goods are much liked, and the
top of each pleat may be decked with tiny gilt
or smoked-pearl buttons. The favorite leather
belt looks extremely well on such a gown.
A blue serge gown had each pleat stitched
along the edges with white thread and was
worn with a white belt.
A tan mixture had each pleat bound with
light-brown leather, and was worn with an
inch-wide belt of the same leather.
This style of waist is much used for bicycle
costumes, and the leather trimmings just de
scribed are especially pretty on these, the skirt
being bound with the same leather.
The skirt shown in this Illustration is the
favorite of the newest shapes, and is used for
separate skirts as well as tor costumes of one
fabric.
The waist pattern is No. 7833 and Is cut in
six sizes for 30 to 42 inches bust measure. A
medium size require* 3JÂ£ yards of 42-inch
goods.
The skirt pattern is No. 7637, and is cut in

There will be a grand reunion of the
parishioners of St. Francis parish at Plitts

tickets has been placed at a minimum
50 cents for adults and 25 cents for chil
dren.

AFTER A TWO YEARS' SOJOURN IN FOREIGN WATERS THE UNITED STATES CRUISER CHARLESTON HAS ONCE MORE REACHED HER BIRTH
PLACE. SHE PRESENTED A VERY PRETTY APPEARANCE IN THE BAY YESTERDAY MORNING WITH HER LONG HOME PENNANT FLYING.
THE CHARLESTON
IS HOME AGAIN,
After Two Years' Absence
She Once More
Reaches Port
HAD SEVERAL MISHAPS.
Built by the Scotts, She Is
the Pride of the Union
Iron Works.
JAPANESE INVASION PROBABLE
Chinese Are Driving Them Out of
Hawaii and They Are Coming
to California.
"Home again from a foreign shore," was
the refrain that every sailor on the United
States cruiser Charleston was singing
as the "pride of the Union Iron
Works" steamed in through the Golaen
Gate yesterday. Without being pressed,
she has made the run from Yokohama, via
Honolulu, in nineteen days and six hours,
and Captain Coffin is more than satisfied.
Frem Yokohama to Honolulu the run was
made in eleven days and three hours, and
from Honolulu to San Francisco in eight
days and three hours, and then the vessel
was only under half steam.
The officers of the cruiser are:
Captain, George W. Coffin; lieutenant-com
mander. W. H. Reeder; lieutenants, G. A. Cal
houn, Alex Sharp Jr., G. H. Stafford, W. P.
White; lieutenants junior grade, W. S Simms,
J. D. McDonald, C. S. Williams; ensigns, E. G.
Witherspoon, H. E. Smith; surueon, C. W,
Gravatt; assistant surgeon, R. G. Brodrick ;
paymaster, C. W. LittlefieM ; chief engineer, C.
J. MacConnell; passed assistant engineers, B.
H. Leomirrl. C. H. Mathews; assistant engineer,
A. T. Holmes; first lieutenant of marines. B. >.
Neumann ; pay officer's clerk, W. Rea Pattison ;
gunner, George Cross; carpenter, George H.
Warford.
She carries a crew of 260 ail told.
The Charleston has been away from
American waters for nearly two years, so
it is no wonder the men were glad to get
home. As she moved up to her anchor
age her enormous homeward-bound pen
nant floated away astern, and the men
evidently took great pride in it.
When on duty in Japanese waters the
Charleston disabled one of her cylinders.
She was tied up nnd a new one ordered
from San Francisco. When it arrived
and a test was made it also proved defec
tive, so another order had to be sent on.
The second cylinder proved to be all right,
but the Navy Department would take no
chances, so the vessel was ordered home.
She will probably go on the Mare Isiand
drydock lor a thorough overhauling.
The crew of the cruder were spectators
at the navul battle between the Japanese
and Chinese fleets at Wei Hai Wei, but
they have nothing new to tell about the
encounter. The Charleston is anchored
off Folsom-street wharf, just abreast of
the Comanche.
The whalebacfc City of Everett met with
a mishap as she was docking at Mission 2
yesterday. A strone flood tide was run
ntnir, out Captain Buckruan thought he
could make his landing without any
trouble. His breast lines were out, and
all went well until the tide caught the
vessel and swung her stern around under
Howard-street wharf. The dolphin and
many of the piles carried away and the
wharf was otherwise damaged, but the
whaleback was uninjured and was berthed
without any further trouble.
The Pacitic Mail Company's steamship
San Jose sailed for Central American
ports yesterday. She will go as far as La
Libertad, and "will clear up all the delayed
freight along the line. She carried no
passengers. Captain Russell, formerly of
the Rio de Janeiro nnd Acapulco, went out
aa master.
The California Navigation and Improve
ment Company started running two
steamers betw- en here and Stockton ves
ter.lay. When the T. C. Walker and Mary
Garreti are leaving San Francisco the J.
D. Pe_3rs and Leader will be leaving
Stockton. The Walker and Peters will
make almost direct runs, but the Garrett
and Leader will stop at ah the landings in
oider to pick up freight. Heavy ship
ments of fruit are expected thio month,
and the company is setting ready to
handle the business.
Harbor Commissioner Cole was around
tiie water front again yesterday. He only
got back from St. Louis last Tuesday

nicht. but he lost no time in getting into
harness again. ''Uncle Dan" is an ardent
MeKinley man and says the man from
Ohio is a sure winner.
In spite of last Monday's disaster the
raisers of the Blairmore have not lost
heart. Yesterday they were hard at work
again and by Sunday everything will be
ready for another trial. Extra precau
tions are being taken and a success is
again expected. The vessel's position has
been considerably changed during the
pnst week and she is now almost opposite
Butcbertown.
Double shifts are belnp worked on the
steamer Gaelic in order to get ber away
on time this afternoon. She was three
days late in getting in, owing to stopping
at Honolulu to land Chinese. In future
two out of every three mail steamers on
the Chinese route will stop at Honolulu
for the same purpose. The Hawaiian
Government does not wish the Japanese
to have the franchise and in consequence
thousands of them will have to seek fresh
fields and pastures new.
The planters are gradually supplying
their places with Chinese labor and incon
sequence every steamer that leaves Hong
kong has at lean 500 Chinese coolies
aboard for the Paradise of the Pacific. The
worst of it is, howover, that the Japs who
cannot get employment any more in
Hawaii are coming to California, so the
orchartlists and vineyardists will have no
lack of cheap labor this season.
Will E. Beach, the popular ticket clerk
at the Southern Pacific ferry depot, was
reinstated yesterday. Some months ago
he was accused of "standing in" with the
scalpers and was suspended. The accuÂ«a
tion was shown to be unfounded and Will
is back at his old post again.

IN THE MORTAR BEDS,
The Civil Engineers Take an
Outing and Visit the Pre
sidio Fortifications.
Closed the Day's Doings With a Lunch
at the Cl ff House and a
Drive Home.
Those members of the American Society
of Civil Engineers who cared to entrust
their safety and pleasure to Local Man
ager Curtis of the Southern Pacific Com
pany visited the Presidio yesterday at
noon.
The time for the meeting bad been set
for 9 o'clock in the morning, but the Cur
tis end of the caravan being three houro
late two distinct parties were in the Held.
General W. M. Graham, in charge of the
Government troops on this coast, was most
gracious. He placed his officers and men
at the disposal of his guests, and every
thing worth scientific inspection on the
grounds and underneath, for that matter,
was seen.
The "mortar beds," situated in sub
terranean passages near Black Point, were
of most interest to the visitors; also the
dynamite guns, one of which was charged
with an air-pressure of 200 pounds from
the 2000-pound chamber and tired. No
missile, however, was placeJ in the mon
ster's jaw. The air-pressure being re
lieved by pulling a string gushed out with
force enough to deafen those people near
est tne cannon and gave a fair idea of the
terrific explosion wnich would ensue with
a 2000-pound pressure and a few hundreds
of pounds of dynamite.
Tne party drove through the Presidio
grounds and Golden Gate ParK, and
lunched at the Cliff House, after having
visited the Olympic Club Ba!t Water
Works on the beach.
After a short visit to Mayor Sutro's
beautiful home the run home was made

HURRICANES AND
THUNDER STORMS,
The Big British Ship Was
dale Reaches Port
at Last.
CONSIDERABLY OVERDUE
Over Twenty Per Cent Reinsur
ance Was Paid on Her
Last Week.
SHE HAD A TERRIBLE TIME.
Boats Were Smashed, Cargo Shifted
and Nearly all the Railing
Carried Away.
After bucking head winds and cross seas
for 151 days, the British ship Wasdale
finally reached port last evening. She is
; from Newcastle, En*., and for over a week
â  has been classed among the "overdnes."
\ From 20 to 25 per cent reinsurance has
! been paid on her, so the gamblers are
pleased.
The story of the Wasdale's trip is a most
interesting one, and Captain Fisher tells
it in a graphic manner. It is as follows:
"We left the Tyne at 4 p. m., January 31,
â¢ and had moderate variable winds down
the channel, which continued to 33 deg.
north 24 <leg. 9 mm. west, then northeast
winds very light to the equator, which we
crossed in 27 deg. west, thirty-'ix dnvs out.
Here we got the southeast trades, which
were very light throughout and were lost
in 18 deg. 8 mm. sout. 1 and 3(3 (leg. west, and
from there to Staten Island we had lisrut
variable winds and remarkably tine
weather, with smooth sea.
"Si^htel Staten Island April 12, seventy
two days out, from which we had a suc
cession of heavy gales from west to west
north-west and very nigh, dangerous sea.
"On April 21, at 10:30 p.m., our yard
arms and mastheads were lit up with balls
of tire, and at 11 :30 p. m. we were struck by
a furious hurricane, which continued for
twenty hours, and which kept the lee side
buried, damaged all our running gear,
smashed both side lights and starboard
poop rail, broke in side ports and deluged
half deck.
"At noon on the 22d had to cut away the
lower foretopsail to relieve the ship." At
thi3 time the sea was breaking frightfully,
causing the ship to lurch very heavily,
and settling the cargo of coke to leeward
slightly. After 6p. m. the gale began to
moderate. The lowest reading of the
barometer and aneroid were both 27.56.
"Hud a continuance of very heavy gales
until May 4, latitude 48.07 south, longitude
80.04 west, then more moderate and vari
able to May 12, latitude 33.40 south, lon
gitude 97 west, when we liad a furious
gale and terrific cross sea, which com
menced suddenly from a light breeze and
heavy rain at east-northeast, but shifting
rapidly to north and northwest, having
to keep dead before it to reduce sail, hove
to with ship's head to the eastward under
goose-winged fore and mizzen topsails,
when it quickly moderated and had ihen
beautiful tine weather and light winds to
the equator, which was crossed on June 2
in 120 west longitude, 123 days out.
"Tuesday, April 21, at noon, with the
aneroid and barometer at 29.04, had a
strong breeze and rain, with high westerly
seas. Ship under reefed topsails and
foresail. Wind about north and hauling,
at 4p. m, to north-northeast, and glass
falling slowly. Weather dark and rainy.
At 7:15 p. m. the glass was 28.66, and at
Bp. m. 28.58, and beginning to fall very
rapidly. Called all bands and put
the ship under two lower topsails
and foretopmast staysail, after which
the weather cleared away con
siderably and looked much" better,
but at 10:30 p. m. the glass was 27.17 and a
squall making np in the northwest, the
mastheads and upper yard arms were all
lit up, the squall coming with terrific vio
lence and striking the ship partly aback
with the helm hard up. but doing no dam
age. At midnicht ttot the foretopmast stay
sail down and made fast; glass 28.11. Gave
orders to take in fore lower topsail if we
had a lull, but dare not attempt to start
it. At 4a. m. weather still the same and
glass 27.59.
"At 5 a. m. the ship was struck in the
starboard mizzen rigging by a terrific sea,
smashing two side ports in entirely in the
half deck and flooding it and cracking sev
eral other ports in the cabin. In one port
in the half deck the worm of screw-bolt
was stripped. We got spare plugs in and
secured. At davlipht found about twenty
feet of starboard poop rail and coverin^-
Doard started, and both sidelight screws
smashed up, the ironwork completely torn
away from the wooa and port forward life
boat cover all torn and blown away, and
all our running gear on port side chafed
and cut, being completely under water.
Had great difficulty in getting it clear.
"At noon the glass had risen to 28.03,
but the wind was blowing with terrilic
force, the sea was breaking in every direc
tion and the ship was completely buried,
so I was compelled to cut away the lower
foretopsail to ease the ship, as it was im
possible to attempt to take it in. Tnis
eased the vessel wonderfully, as it caused
her io drift directly away from the broken
water and to lift the lee side occasionally.
At 4 p. m. the glass was 28.03 and at 6 p. m.
28.72, and the weather then graaually
moderated. From that to port we had
moderate but gloomy weather."
The Wasdale does not show many signs
of her rough experience, but nevertheless
everj- man Jack aboard is glad the vessel
is safe in port.

CAV. SERRA IS SATISFIED,
The Italian Consul-General Ex
presses Pleasure at Being
Here.
Yesterday His O.fice Was Open to All
Who Chose to Visit
Him.
The new Italian Consul-General, Cay.
Carlo Philip Serra. is a pleasant, genial
man, who gives every promise of becom
ing immensely popular witu the colony.
Yesterday he began to initiate himself
into the duties of his new office, and did it
in a way which showed him to be what
the Italians call "democratico," and which
means, without any frills or haughty at
tempt at superiority. No bureaucratic
red-tapism held visitors back from seeing
Cay. Serra; the doors of the Consulate
were open to all visitors, and people who
wanted to see him coul<i walk into the
inner office and visit the Consul-General.
Cay. Serra expressed himself as being de
lighted with his present appointment.
"San Francisco is considered one of the
best Italian consular positions in the
United Btates," he said. "The people
are pleasant and harmonious, the climate
is delightful. What can a man want
more? and the Consul-General laughed
with satisfaction at the smiling future
before him.
Cay. Serra says that he is fond of Ameri
cans. He has given proof of the fact by
marrying an American lady and in all the
consular positions that he has held in the
United States he has been popular in
American society. In 1885 he went to New
Orleans, remaining there two and a half
years. He has also held consular positions
in Philadelphia, Boston and Baltimore,
so his acquaintance with the United States
is quite extensive.
For two years he was in Chile. Those
were war years and exciting times, but he
never met with any personally exciting
incidents, or if he did, he modestly
conceals the fact. Just as peace was de
clared in Valparaiso he was recalled
Although a native of Genoa, he makes
his headquarters in Rome, when in Italy,
partly because it is the seat of Govern
ment and also because he has a strong
personal liking for the Eternal City. He
has just come from there and when* ques
tioned yesterday about the war feeling in
Italy replied that though every one had
deeply deplored the losses in Abyssinia
feeling was quite calm on the matter.
As for the suffering condition of the
peasants in the interior of the country the
Consul-General said that though there
was considerable poverty things were not
quite so bad as some of the report^ had
represented them to be.
There does not seem to be any intention
on Cay. Serra's part to make sweeping
changes at the consulate.
"Things seem to be in a very satisfac
tory condition and I see no reason for not
letting them go on in the same way," he
said cheerfully.
For the next fey/ weeks the new Consul-
General and his wife will live at the Occi
dental Hotel, but he intends shortly to
take a country villa, probably at San Ma
teo, and only spend office hours in the
City.

MONEY DISTURBED
BY SILVER TALK,
A New Question Arises
to Paralyze Busi
ness.
BANKERS ARE PUZZLED.
After Getting Rid of Taxes They
Are Confronted With More
Trouble.
SUMMER DIVIDENDS MADE.
The Hibernia Bank Reduces the Inter
est on Deposits â Future Is
in Doubt.
A: the close of the first six months of
IS9G the local savings banks rind finances
dull, money in a rather limited supply and
interest almost as low as it could possibly
sink. Tbe bankers were in hopes that on
July 1 their troubles over interest due to
the San Francisco tax rate of 2.25 per
centum would be at an end, and that the
next six months would be more favorable
to depositors. Everything pointed to a
largely reduced rate of taxation, and with
such a prospect it was inferred that inter
est vrould advance in proportion.
Now, however, at the turning of the tide
bankers are confronted with altogether a
different condition, which makes a mate
rial change in tueir calculations. In fact,
as managers of the savings banks put it,
tbe cry for free silver has completely
thwarted all plans, and the financiers are
asking themselves, like Cleveland, "Where
are we at?"
The Hibernia Savings and Loan Society
announced yesterday that the interest
paid by that'institution had been reduced
frorp 4to '&% per centum. The Columbus
Savings and Loan Society, the Savings and
Security Savings Bank, the Humboldt
Savings and Loan Society and the San
Francisco Savings Union declared divi
dend? of 4.32 per centum on term deposits
and 3.60 on ordinary deposits. The German
Savings and Loan Society paid 4.26 and
3.55 per centum, the Mutual Savings Bank
4 and 3.33Â» 3 . The Columbian Banking
Company declared a dividend of 6 per cen
tum on its paid up capital.
Lovell White, cashier of the San Fran
cisco Savings Union, said that conditions
as he founa them in the savings banks
signified no distress. '-Money is not In
plethoric supply," he said. "There is
enough for the needs of the people, but it
does not press on the loan market. Inter
est rates are the same practically as in
last January. There is no cheap'money,
as ther<* is employment for ail 'available
coin. To-day is dividend day, and the de
mand for dividends and maturing notices
is less than usual."
"What does this signify ? '
"That there is no monetary distress;
also that tlie people are loth to employ
money or take returns. If business was
active we wouid be loaning out more
money.
â¢ 'The tax question and the silver question
are the bugbears of this country to-day.
They are checking enterprise, and until
the tax rate is settled and the silver ques
tion disposed of, at least in the minus of
the people, there cannot be much revival
of business. People are living from hand
to mouth, and banks are affected the same
way â band to mouth. There is nothing
that denotes a boom or a healthy condi
tion of society. The banks will "suffer in
common with the community on the
silver question.
"Bankers see great disaster, not to
themselves alone but to the community,
in the free coinaee of silver. Banks and
capitalists will suffer less, but they de
plore it ali tne same in the interest o"f the
public. It would be a clean-cut fight be
tween common-sense and madness if the
Democrats should dissolve in favor of the
free coinage of silver."
The president of the German Savings
Bank said that bankers generally were
waiting to see what the political parties
were going to do with regard to gold and
silver. â¢â¢This silver agitation upsets se
curities," he added. "With it before you
you cannot teil anything of tbe future. If
the money question is settled favorably to
the gold standard, even by tbe Democrats
in their National Convention, it will help
t nings a great deal."
ROSE COGHLAN ROBBED.
She Arrives Bewailing the Los* of a
Silver Set Lost From the
Train.
Rose Coghlan, the actress, who arrived
here last night from the East, says she
was robbed on tha train of her contracts
with several theatrical companies and of
her daintily engraved silver toilet articles.
The thief entered tne palace-car pre
sumably at Winnemucca ISev., and made
off with the actress' satchel, which she
had carefully placed under her berth be
fore retiring for tne night.
Th* porter informed her that the agent
at "Winnemucca had telegraphed that a
satchel supposed to belon* to her had been
found near the station. Miss Coghlan was
a little mortified and amused when, in
reply to an inqniry, the answer came:
"Nothing in bag but papers, gentleman's
boot and child's soiled blouse.*
Miss Coghlan says the articles taken
comprised a silver-backed hand-mirror,
giyen her last Christmas by Sadie Marti
not; a silver soapdish, a silver shoehorn,
a silver button-hook, and soch thingsâ all
engraved with the initials "R. C." Then
tnere was a large gold-stoppered scent
bottle and a pair of pins set with large
paste diamonds, a parting gift from her
little adopted daughter.
"Apart from this experience," said Miss
Coghlau, "I had a delightful trip across
the continent. I open here with 'Car
men,' but I rope to do 'Madame' during
my three weeks' engagement. 'Madame'
was written by my brother, Charles Cogh
ian, and proved a great success in Nsw
York. From here I may go directly to
London to see 'MaxO'Rell' staged before
1 play it in Chicago."
OLYMPIC CLUB DOINGS.
Instructor Clarke Will Be Reinstated.
A Purse for Maher and Ihornski.
The Olympic Club directors held a rery
lengthy meeting last evening. A petition
from Professor Harry Clarke, the swim
ming instructor, and signed by several
hundred members was presented for his
reinstatement.
As there was other business of more im
portance to be transacted the petition was
laid on the table to t>e acted on at the next
meeting. Director Short was instructed
to inform Clarke that he could go to work
again until such time as the club will
take final action in his case.
It was decided that the interior of the
bui'ding be renovated. Painters and deco
rators will be put to work in a few days
embellishing the departments that require
overhauling.
Peter Maber has sent an offer to box Joe
Cbovnski in theciub.but no reply has been
received as yeu Maher was offered a
purse of $4000, but it is now thought that
he will meet Choynaki in New York.
The handball tournament of tbe club
wih be held at tne Occidental ball court,
commencing on July 16. It will last for
three days.
POOLMEN ARRESTED.
A Limb of the Law in the Person of
Marshal Creed Swoops Down on
Two at SausaHto.
The Sausalito minnions of the law have
determined that the poolmen shall not
haTe things all their own way during the
absence of the Town Trustees. Yesterday
City Attorney Silya swore out warrants
for the arrest of P. Berrieros, who rents
rooms to Harry Corbett <fe Co., and E.
Westerson, from whom Harrison & Co.
rent rooms.
Marshal Creed made the arrests, and,
upon the prisoners' demand for a jury
trial, the cases were set for July 11 and 12
respectively. Both Corbett and Harrison
have licenses for commission houses
which do not expire until July 15, so a
nice legal point may arise at the" trial as to
whether the Town Attorney had a rieht to
arrest them when doing business under a
license.
A SEAMAN'S PLAINT.
SayÂ« He WaÂ« Unjustly Treated at the
Sailors' Home.
Dennis Noonan is an American seaman.
He was discharged from the bark Meirose,
and left the hospital in Honolulu and
came to this City on a pass given him by
the American Consul.
Upon his arrival, being sick and desti
tute, he applied for admission into tbe
Sailors' Home, which was once the United
States Marine Hospital. With him were a
Scotchman and a Swede, who also wished
to be taken into the home. Superin
tendent Staples, after asking the men
Sergeant Linville and His Squad as They Are Billed to Appear on the Roof of the Mechanics'
Pavilion To-Night.
-heir nationality, so Noonan alleges, said
to him, "I've got no uss for you." but
admitted the Scotch sailor ami the Swede
stowaway.
"It was a gross injustice," said NoonÂ«n,
"and I suppose I was denied admittance
because I was an American. Until I met
John Curtm, who keeps a place on Main
street and kindly took me in and is caring
for me, I went hungry and had a rough
time of it."
ARE LOOKING FOB BLOOD.
Chinese Highbinders Out in Force
Ready and Eager for
War.
Shooting Affray Prevented by the
Prompt Action of Two Special
Policemen.
â¢ A highbinder war, which threatens to
assume an unusually serious c baracter, is
brewing in Chinatown. At any moment
the police patrolling the Mongolian
quarter may be startled by a fusillade in
some one of the dark alleys. They expect
it and are confident that betore the See
Yup-Sam Yup controversy is concluded,
many a fighting Chines* will have passed
into his celestial home.
Yesterday afternoon, at 1 o'clock, Wonjr
j Sing Long, president of;tbe Wong Society,
and a number of bis followers held a
i meeting for the purpose of discussing the
; warlike situation in a small room on the
j third floor of a brick building on the cot-
I ncr of Clay street and Brenhaxn place.
j They were chatting peacefully on the See
Yup complication when in stalked fire
highbinders, memoersof their own family,
society and company.
The intruders were strongly in favor of
declaring the boycott off the Sam Yup
Company, and believing that Wonu Sing;
Long and his col.eagues had determined to '
stand the boycotting combination con- I
eluded to resort to force of arms. Imme- '.
diately upon entering the council room
the fighting men drew their revolvers, j
Pandemonium then reigned supreme. \
Jabbering Chinese fell over one another in
the little room in their endeavors to es
cape.
This move was so unexpected that the
high binders bad no opportunity to use
their revolvers for fear of killing one of
their number. The noise of the conflict
finally reached the ears of two special
policemen, James Belyeaand William Mc-
Cottery, and before the Chinese, who were
bra tea murder, had a chance to single an ;
enemy out of the croup, the officers were â¢
in the room. They seizeti tne nearest
Chinese and after ?natcbirrg a nuge pistol i
from his grasp placed him under arrest.
The other highbinders escaped.
Sergeants Helms, Wollweber and Ear- I
per, the latter having the Chinatown squad j
under his command, are anxious that no
killine shall be done and are using every :
means in their power to prevent it.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JULY 2, 1896.
DEADHEADS ARE
FEELING SORRY,
They Have No Way of Get
ting in to See the
Fight To-Night.
P. D. LINVILLE'S SGUAD.
Two Score Patrolmen Who Walk
a Roof Like So Many
Cats.
AND THEY USE THEIR CLUBS.
A New Scheme of Corbett's to Protect
His Interests in the Sharkey
Contest.
Among other evils, the recent pugi
listic events have given birth to a new
kind of "squad."
This is the view taken by the small and
irrepressible boy, the impecunious picnic
tough, and the "dead hard tongh 1 ' who
never has paid his way into any show and
" oMldn't enjoy the same if he did.
The Chinatown squad with Harry Hook
in it is bad enough, and the porch
climbe*rs, bamboo- tootors and their kind
know enough to keep away from it, but
this new squadâ The Roof Squadâ is some
thing out of the ordinary and "de gang
feels bad."
Told in a few words the thing is simply â 
this: When the different athletic duos in
this City began giving pugilistic exhibi
tions at the Pavilion the place was always
crowded. But the box receipts failed to I
show that the attendance was full paid.
Then the Mechanics' Institute began send
ing in bills of from $300 to $500 for dam- :
ages, breakage of windows and other un
satisfactory mishaps.
This gave the managers the first cue to !
the situation and the police were called in ;
to stop up the holes through which the !
deadheads crawled.
They only succeedec in a partial way.
When Jim Corbett, wish his business
education at the hands of Billy Brady, was
to get 50 per cent in the four-round go with |
Sharkey, he made sure he would not get j
much the worst of the deadheads.
He appealed to Chief Crowley for a i
special set of officers. They were not I
chosen from the regular force, but among !
stout and active men in other lines of '
business or professions. P. D. Linville, a
former officer on the force, was placed in
charge of them and his ''roof squad" is
now a thing of permanency.
Instead of parading up and down the
street in front of the Pavilion, the new j
squad, like so many cats, patrol the roof. !
This is no easy matter where the slant is '
at an angle of more than 20 degrees. But |
the men wear spikes in their shoes, and, j
club in hand, they march up and down '
protecting the cupola windows, tbrougd i
which, heretofore, more deadheads came '
than through the front door.
During the progress of the Corbett-
Sbarkey fight a thousand men and boys
were clubbed off the roof. They were not
hurt much, but tapped just enough to
make them understand it was not as easy i
as it nsed to be to beat the box-office.
Similar arrangements have been made â 
for the tights to be held to-night and the i
porch or roof climbers are comparatively I
unhappy. â 
NEW BOXING RULES.
James Fleming; Carroll Han Bevised
the QaeÂ«nÃberry Bulea and Believe*
He Has Improved Them.
Jimmy Carroll, the ex-chanipion light
weight pugilist of the world, has for some
weeks past been studying out and figuring
i upon new rules to govern boxing contests.
Carroll says that the Marquis of Queens
berry rules are good, but that they do not
; cover enough territory. The ex-champion
I lightweight . has just completed a set of
I rules which cover every point o.' the game
I and make the task of , the referee light and
; pleasant. The ; following is a copy of Car
roll's new rules, which wiil be known as â 
"Fair Play Rules," and it goes without
saying that every boxing club will adopt
them as an improvement on the old Mar
quis of Queensberry rules:
Sax Francwco, June 12, 1896
Editor Call: As there has been Â« great deal '
of trouble about the rules of boxing, and tnere '
beinc no professional rules, I, James Fleming !
Carroll, ao submit the following for profes- i

the rereree or speak to him daring the one minute
I allowed for the rest.
Fifth articleâ lf either mÂ»n falls through weak
ness or otherwise he will be allowed ten seconds to |
get upon his leet without help or coaching by his i

his opponent, it shall be the power of the referee
to stop the contest and give the reward to the
other man. Should a limited round contest be j
. stopper by an unavoidable interference, the judges I
and referee shall decide in favor of the man taav

i Also In a finish contest the referee shall decide In

The lepers at the Pesthonse looked yes

They were eager to try the zreat anti

I pointed.
Owing to an unexpected bitch â¢in the

hands.; But no vehicle stopped . at the
Pest-house entrance and no draymen

Lively Proceedings in the
Thornton-Auzerais
Case.
CURIOUS POINT OF LAW.
Can a Divorcee Legally Marry
Within a Year After the
Separation?
WHO DAMAGED THE FURNITUEE
A Witness Who Gnashed Her Teeth
Before Answering Irritating
Questions.
Mrs. Lucy W. Auzerais-Hoyte has a
temper of her own. So has Attorney Crit
tenden Thornton. When they clashed in
Judge Trourt's court yesterday, the crowd
of aliens in the back row waiting to be
naturalized trembled with fear and several
of them glanced longingly towara the
door.
Attorney Thornton's wife is suing the
actress for $2000 claimed to be due for dam
ages inflicted by the latter upon the goods
of a furnished house which Mrs. Thornton
rented to Mrs. Hoyte. Mr. Thornton is
conducting the case on behalf of his
spouse, and consequently his zeal in the
matter is somewhat warmer than molten
metal. When Mrs. Hoyte testified he
asked her questions, some of which she
seemed unable to answer before she had
relieved her feelings by grinding her teeth.
The nerve-racking sound of their gnashing
had haraly time to die away before the
echoes were again awakened, so fast did
the belligerent lawyer fire objectionable
queries at the lady of the resonant jaw.
The facts in the case, as set forth in the
complaint, which was filed in September,
f 1895, are that Mrs. Hoyte, who was then
Mrs. Louis Auzerais, rented a furnished
house on Pacific avenue, near Pierce
street, from the Thorntons, for waich it
was agreed to pay $160 per monti. rent.
On September 13 the attorney was in
formed by telephone that his tenants
would vacate next day. After their depar
ture Thornton inspected the bouse and in
the language of the complaint fouid it
"foully Tilt y and having the appearance
of not being cleaned or swept for months."
Much of the furniture, it was claimed,
was also broken, burned or stained.
The case has been postponed and hung
fire on one pretext or another and did not
come up for trial until yesterday. Even
then further delay was sought. The at
torney for the defense tried to introduce a
! supplemental answer wherein tne name
i of Hereward Hoyte, the present husband
of the defendant, was inclu ied. The mo
tion was argued at length ana brought to
light a legal point that will be of interest
to many people.
Mrs. Lucy W. Auzerais-Hoyte was
divorced from .Louis A. Auzerais bn Marc a
18, 1896. and married to Hereward Hovte on
Marcn 2i, 1896. It was claimed that Hoyte
could not be included as a defendant* in
the suit as the husband of Mrs. Auzerais
because she bad not been divorced from
her former husband for a year.
The statutes provide that during the
j twelve months following the decision of
the Superior Court in such a case the de
feated contestant may appeal to the Su
. prerae Court. Therefore a person who
marries a divorcee withia that period
takes a chance that such a proceeding be
â¢ brought and the divorce set aside. Hoyte,
it was argued, will not be legally the hus
band of Mrs. Auzerais until the year has
expired. Judge Troutt lent some signifi
> cance to the argument by denying the 1
â  motion to enter tbe amended complaint.
Mrs. Auzerais-Hoyte was the first wit
i ness called, and the strained relations be
: tween her and Mr. Thornton were at once
; apparent. The attorney neglected no op- !
: portunity of referring to the unclean con- \
' dition in which he says be found his prop- j
erty, and the witness overlooked no !
; chance to refer to the poor quality and !
i general dilapidation of the goods when :
she first took possession of them.
"Did you have the globes on the gas fix
! tures cleaned while you occupied the |
place?" queried the lawyer.
"Several times, but they were so cov
ered with fly specks that "we found it im
possible to get them clean," replied the
witness.
"You couldn't get fly specks off by look-
I ing at them," sneered Thornton.
"And there were so macv there when I
moved in that you couldn't remove them
with acid," said Mrs. Hoyte.
"What was the condition of tbe curtains
in the front room when yon took posses
j sion? ' resumed the attorney.
The witness smiled wickedly. "Rotten "
I she replied.
Little personal allusions were plentiful
{ before the witness stepped down, but it
I waa developed that a little son of the de
! fendant had removed a pendulum from a
1 parlor clock, and had bestowed sundry
kicks and knocks upon the different pieces
; of furniture. Thornton claims to have
i counted 146 indentations made by the toes
! of shoes on one door and titty-four on an
! other. Mrs. Hoyte acknowledges that
there may be four or five in all.
Mr. Thornton was on the stand detail
ing his troubles when court closed for the
day.

TIE FORGERS.
Says He and Creegan
Planned the Nevada
Bank Forgery.
BECKER'S FINE WORK.
Alleged to Have Been Done
for Creegan in Oak
land.
CREEGAN'S EASTERN RECORD.
He and Dean Were Together in the
Maryland Penitentiary Over
Two Years.
A vast amount of evidence was intro
duced yesterday in the trial of Creegan
nnd Becker for forgery. The morning
session was taken up with the testimony
of the officials of the various banks that
handled the forged draft.
The testimony of Frank L. Seaver, or
A. H. Dean as he is better known, was the
feature of the afternoon session. He told
in the most maiter-01-fact way of the con
spiracy into which he and Creegan had
entered, how they selected this City as the
best field to make a little money and how
tnev arranged every detail of the scheme.
He recounted every step of the operation
in such a delibera;e and pleasant manner
that even Judge Wallace acknowledged at
the close of the day's session that it was
the most interesting story he had ever
listened to.
The spectators, who filled the courtroom
and galiery, were a motley throng, con
sisting of all sorts and conditions of men
from bank presidents to seedy denizens of
the slums.
C. F. Thomas, the cashier of the Bank
of Woodland, testified that about 3 o'clock
in the afternoon of December 9, 1895, a
stranger had come into the bank and
asked for a check on the San Francisco
bank for $12 and Cashier Thomas had sold
him the check. Attorney Black here sub
mitted the check, which was in a frame
and under glass. As it reads now the
check is dated December 13 instead of
December 9, as originally, and is for
$22,000 instead of $12. The stabbook cor
responding to the check wa3 identified by
the witness and submitted in evidence.
When asked by Attorney Black whether
he would recognize the man Dean, or
Scott, as he gave his name in Woodland,
Cashier Thomas declared that he would.
Dean was brought into the courtroom and
identified as the man to whom he had
soifi the check.
William H. Crocker, the president of the
Crocker- Woolworth National Bank, was
called by the prosecution. He testified
that the Crocker- Wool worth Bank had
done business with the Bank of Woodland
since 1?83. He identified the raised check
in question, which he had first
seen in January, 1896, after it had
passed through the Clearing-house
and had been paid by the Nevada
Bank. The check had be'en returned to
the Crocker Bank by the Bank of Wood
land.
O. B. Fogle, paying teller of theCrocker-
Woolworth Bank, identified the check,
whicn had come into his hands in Decem
ber, 1895. It had come in an envelope
through the Clearing- house from the
Nevada Bank. The Crocker Bank had
paid the check to the Nevada Bank
through the ciearing-house. After ex
plaining to the jury what the Clearing
house was and how it was conducred Tell
er Fogle was excused.
J. F. Kavanagh, a clerk in the Nevada
Bank, who sometimes relieved the receiv
ing teller and did the clearing-house
work, testified that he had received the
check from Dean and had had the book
keeper enter the check to Dean's credit.
He had also entered the amount in Dean's
passbook. He identified both the check
and the passbook. The passbook was sub
mitted in evidence by the District Attor
ney. The deposit tag which Dean pre
sented along with the check was also iden
tified and offered in evidence. No other
person in the bank had seen the check be
fore it went out of the bank to tne Clear
ing-house.
George Grant, assistant cashier and pay
ing teller of the Nevada Bank, was shown
the check, which he hfd first seen in the
hands of Captain Lees. Cashier Grant
gave an account of the various transac
tions of Dean with the bank, consisting of
the following items:
December 4 A. H. Dean deposited $2500 in
greenbacks; December 7, drew $400 in coin;
December V 2, drew $700 in coin; December
13, deposiu-'l .*.200 in currency; December 13,
deposited check on the Anglo-California Bank
lor December 13, deposited $7U5 in cur
rency and checks; December 17, deposited
$22,000 in a check on the Crocker-Woolworth
Hank; December 17, drew $ 2200 in coin; De
cember 18, drew $20,000 in gold coin.
Teller Grant had paid the $20,000 to
Dean in four bags of $5000 each, which had
come from the ban Francisco sub-treasury,
and which Grant had not opened. The
witness was requested to produce at the
afternoon session the daily balance for
December 17, 1895.
On cross-examination Grant said that
when Dean came into the office there was
another man with him â a short man.
Dean asked for greenbacks, but Grant told
him he could only give him greenbacks of
small denominations, which would make
a bulky package. Dean's companion sug
gested that he take gold coin. Grant told
Dean he could give him four sacks of
$5000 each. The other man then told Dean
he had better take the sacks. Grant then
went to the vault, got the sacks and re
turned to the counter. Dean put the four
t-acks into a satchel and with his com
panion left the bank. Both Becker and
Creegan were pointed out to ' ant, but he
could not identify either as 11. companion
of Dean.
Attorney Dunn questioned the witness
closely as to the resemblance between Mc-
Closkey and the companion of Dean.
Orant admitted that there was quite a
similarity between the two men, but not a
very great similarity. Dean and his com
i anion were in the bank about five min
utes. The witness thought it was no more
than this, although it might have been
ten minutes. The court then adjourned
until 2 o'clock.
Before the court convened in the after
noon the bainff opened the gallery to ac
commodate the crowd of spectators. The
cloud of dust started up by threescore
handkerchiefs sweeping the benches
threatened to stifle everybody in the
< >urtroom. When the door downstairs
was unlocked the crowd came in with a
rush in spite of the efforts of Bailiff Curtis
to stem it.
Edgar L. Rourke, the youthful-looking
l ouKkeeper of the Nevada Bank, was the
hr.-t witness called m the afternoon. He
i'ientitied the entry oi Dean's account in
the current account ledger of the bank as
having been made in his own hand
writing. The corresponding entries in
the cashbooK were also severally ex
amined, as well as the balance-sheet for
December, which showed a balance in
Dean'a favor of $21,995 on the 17th and
$1995 on the 18th.
Cashier Grant was put on the stand
merely to answer several formal questions
a* *o the identity of ihe papers which
Bookkeeper Rourke had testified to. â¢
Cashier Thomas was also recalled to state ;
that he had not given anybody authority j
to raise the $12 check.
F. L. Seaver, better known as A. H.
Dean, was called and sworn. In answer
to Attorney Wilson's questions the wit
ness said he was 36 years of age, was a
native of Massachusetts and had first seen
Creegan in the Baltimore County Jail,
where he (Seaver) was held on a charge of
forgery. He had been in Creegan's com
pany only two or three days at that time.
He again met him in the Maryland peni
tentiary, where they were associated for
two years and a half.
The next meeting between Seaver and
Creeean, after their release from the Mary
land penitentiary, was on Broadway, near
Thirtieth street, New York, in April, 1893.
He had first met Becker at theSheepshead
Racetrack, near Coney Island, in company
with Creegan. He had seen him also with
Creegan in London, England.
Seaver had come to California in the
latter part of November, 1895. Before
coming to California tie had met Creegan
on several occasions in the East, and had
conversations with him relative to certain
transactions to be carried out in California.
The first of these conversations was held
at the Hotel Savoy, at New York, late in
October or early in November, 1895.
The conversation was in regard to select
ing some place to make a little money.
Creegan suggested that San Francisco was
a good place to work, because large drafts
were readily accepted. Creegan further
suggested that Seaver should open an ac
count in San Francisco, and later they
should raise a draft. Seaver said that
neither he nor Creegan could raise a
draft, but that Becker could.
Creegan and Seaver had several meet
ings at the letter's house and elsewhere in
New York in regard to the proposed Cali
fornia operations. They had discussed
the best means of making money, and had
concluded that it would not be a good
plan to forge an indorsement, as an oper
ation of that kind had been discovered in
California shortly before.
Seaver arrived here in the latter part of
November, 1!<95, and registered at a hotel
as A. D. Howe. He shortly afterward took
a trip to the country, going to Red Bluff,
Woodland and other towns. He had
bought a draft for $95 at Red Bluff and
two drafts at Woodland â one for $12 on
the Woodland Bunk and another for $11
from the Yoio Bank. All these he gave
to Creeuan on the ferry-boat when he re
turned to the City. The understanding
was for Creegan to submit these three
drafts to Becker, and for him to select the
one most suitable for raising.
Before leaving New York Seaver had
made an appointment with Creegan to
meet him In front of the Lick House on
the evening of November 28. They did
not meet until about December, when they
accidentally came together in the Palace
grillroom. * The two talked the matter
over and agreed upon Seaver's subsequent
course in opening an office in the Chroni
cle building and opening an account with
the Nevada Bank. Creegan at the time
told Seaver that Becker, although not in
this City, was near by and was ready to
do any "artistic work."
The witness recounted the various de
posits he had made in the bank. He had
conversations with Creegan as to what
would be the best amount to start in with
to impress the bank people of bis financial
standing. Creegan had told Seaver that
he was stopping at the Grand Hotel under
the name of J. P. Holland.
Upon bis return from Woodland Seaver
met Creepan on the boat. Creegan got
the drafts from Seaver and took the next
boat back to Oakland, telling him that he
would take them back to Becker to decide
which was the beat to raise. The drafts
were placed between ihe leaves of a Bank
ers' Almanac in order to keep them Hat
and without creases. When he gave them
to Creegan Seaver gave his opinion taat
the Woodland draft would be the best to
raise on account of the high standing of
the Woodland bank.
On the following evening Creegan and
Seaver met at lJush street and Grant
avenue in this City. Creegan returned the
$u~> Red Bluff draft because it had on it a
printed statement that it was good only
for sums less than $1000. Crcegan agreed
with beaver that the Woodland check
would be the best to raise, and declared
that, although t- . draft was on National
safety draft paper, which is of particularly
sensitive color and easily disfigured when
acid is used upon it, nevertheless Becker
could raise it without a great deal of
trouble.
On December 16 Creegan and Seaver
met and went together to Oakland to get
the draft from Becker. Seaver waited at
a saloon on Broadway while Creegan went
to s c Becker. Creegan reported, how
ever, that the acid had run all over the
check and that it would take considerable
work with the camel's hair brush to fix it.
On the next day Creegan got the draft
and, meeting Seaver by appointment, gave
him the draft, at the same time asking
him if "that was not a pretty piece of
work."
On the following day Seaver deposited
the check and withdrew most of his cash
balance at the same time.
The witness recounted the steps he had
taken to make an impression of his busi
ness standing. He had rented an office in
the Chronicle building and employed an
office-boy merely in order to have some
body to drive Ins buggy when he should
draw the $20,000. On the night before the
money was drawn Seaver met Creegan
and arranged to meet him and McCloskey
the next morning at the corner of Third
and Mission streets. Seaver was to draw
the money and drive away, and Creegan
and McCloskey were to follow him to see
that no harm came to Seaver.
On the morning when the money was
drawn Seaver bought a sack which he
thought would hold the money, and with
his office-boy engaged a buggy and gave \
the boy such instructions as to keep him
long enough to permit Creegan and Mc-
Closkey to follow. Seaver and the boy
drove slowly downtown, stopped awhile
before the "Occidental Hotel and then
drove to the bank.
Seaver went into the bank alone, he
thought. A man came in later, however
â one of the bank's customers, he thought. |
He was positive that the stranger was j
neither Creegan nor McCloskey. After j
some discussion as to what kind of money I
he should take he finally took four bass of \
$5000 each, and drove out to the Mission |
and stopped in front of a house. Then he
dismissed the boy with the buggy and
took a Valencia-street car downtown. He
carried the money to the Lexington House,
212 Eddy street, where he had rooms.
Here he met McCloskey, and the two put
the money into four woolen stockings and
burned the original sacks. Then McCloskey
took two of the stockings downstairs to
Creegan, who was waiting at the door.
Tne court here adjourned until this
morning at 10 o'clock, when the direct ex
amination of Witness Seaver will be re
sumed. Probably Attorney Wilson will
consume about an hour more in his direct
examination, and then Attorney Dunn
will attempt to break down Seavor's testi
mony on cross-examination.
LEZINSKY LOSES.
Judge Seawell Decides That He Has
No Claim Against the School
Board.
Judge Seawell yesterday banded down
his decision in the case of Isidor Lezinsky,
who sued the Board of Education for bacK
salary, claiming to have been employed as
a teacher in the Business Evening School.
The claim Â«:rew out of the merging of
the Commercial Evening School into its
successor. LezinsKy was employed as a
teacher of bookkeeping in the former, and
claimed to have been transferred to the
latter.
Judge Seawell, however, decided that
Lezlnsky had, at no time since August 30,
1893, been in the employ of the Board of
Education, and was consequently entitled
to no remuneration. Judgment for costs
was given for the defendant.
The Hale & Norcrogi Suit. â
Arguments for a new trial in the famous

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JULY 2, 1896.
THE THIRTY-FOURTH
HAS ORGANIZED,
From One Hundred and
Fifty to Six Hundred
and Seventy.
IN A FEW MONTHS.
A Formidable Portion of the
Eleventh Ward Getting
in Trim.
INDORSING THE LEADERS.
Prominent Business Men Assist Their
Young Friends in C:ub For
mation.
That little section of the great munici
pality fii San Francisco known as the
Thirty-fourth Assembly District, which
takes in bat a email portion of the
Officers of the Thirty-Fourth Assembly District Republican Club, 1896.
Eleventh Ward, bounded by Eleventh,
Guerrero, Twenty-first and Harrison
i streets, contains some of the best Repub
licans in this City, as has time and again
been proven when their Democratic friends
threw down the gauntlet of party battle.
Who elÂ«e could have defeated the
selected Democratic champions put forth
to do battle for the office of Sheriff twice
in succession but a stalwart like C. S. Lau
meiater, who resides in this district? To
him and such as ex-Supervisor Micah
Doane and other popular and well-known
Republicans of the district do those young
men look for advice and counsel when a
hotly contested campaign is about to be
encountered. On Buch men experienced
to guide the party to victory do the young
men of this district rely for political in
struction when counsel becomes necessary.
To the young men not only of the
Th irty-fourth District but throughout the
State and Nation does the Republican
party turn for a perpetuation of the suc
cess of the party. The old men with fixed
political ideas are unchangeable. There
j are men in the Democratic party to-day
I who honestly believe they are voting for
Andy Jackson and Sam Tilden every time
they go to the ballot-box. But year after
year those honest old men are dropping
out and joining the leaders of their party
on the other side ol the big river, where
there are no Koldbugs or repeating at the
ballot-box. In their stead the young
native-born, educated man votes the
ticket that will put that party in power
| which will elevate the great masses of the
people, and be knows full well that that
party is the Republican party.
Of this class of thinking men are the
members of the Thirty-fourth District
Club composed. This club was organized
about six months ago under the auspices
of the Republican Executive Council of
California, with a membership of 150,
wnich has steadily grown to its present
membership of G7O. For this prosperous
condition credit must be given to P. J.
Hurst, president; E. W. Eustice, secre
tary, R. B. Bartlett, treasurer, and Charles
H. Mayers, chairman of the executive
committee.
With those officers the following well
known residents of the district, who com
pose the executive committee, rendered
able assistance in bringing the club up to
its exalted position : 5. M. Williams, Cord
H. Wetjen, W. W. Whan, William Cash
man, O. E. Fairfieid, J. B. Elkington,
Joseph Becsey. George W. Elder, Con
Hilderbrandt, F. J. Hurst, J. H. Harney
George Dieterle. E. B. Smith, James
Smiley, E. W. Eustice, C. C. Butt, S. L.
Lent and H. G. Krasky.
To co-operate with those is one vice
president for each precinct, divided as
follows: Vice-presidentsâ Dr. E. L. Mul
ligan, chairman; C. W. Baker, secretary
Louis Cella, J. A. Pries, G. T. Barber
George Burkhardt, J. Hanson, W. J. K.rk
wood, W. H. Ussher, Fred Grimes, F. M.
Zeising, D. J. Kelley, William Cairns, Wil
liam Munson, Harry Beasley, Neil Henr"
Joseph Lavaff, J. R. Kirby, G. B. Craw
ford, and A. R. Paul, sergeant-at-arms.
In addition to the above-named active
workers who have labored to bring the
club up to its present standing in the
party there are in the district and among
the members of the club the following
well-known Republicans and prominent
business men: Supervisor Hobbs, ex-
Sheriff C. S. Laumeister, Superintendent
of Schools Madison Babcock, School Di
rector H. C. Henderson. John Center
Percy Beamish, John L. Boone and sev
eral others equally as prominent and well
known in the ranks of the party.
Having succeeded in establishing a first
class club the officers and members are
desirous of having an ornamental wing in
tne shape of a drill corps. To accomplish
this a committee consisting of E. B
Smith. Cord H. Wetlin and F. W. Zeising
is making the necessary arrangements for
a first-class battalion, which will have a
regalia befitting the occasion, with ban
ners, etc., that when the club turns out in
procession its members will be observed
in the line of march with their associates.
Permanent headquarters will be estab
lished within the next eight days. To ac
complish this desirable object a commit
tee of five, composed of E. W. Eustice. J.
H. Harney, Joseph Becsey, George W.
Elder and D. J. Kelley, was appointed.
At a recent meeting of the club the fol
lowing resolutions were offered and car
ried unanimously:
Whereas, The Republican County Commit
tee has, In its wisdom, deemed it for the best
interem of our party to increase the usefulness
of its body by the addition of one more member
from each Assembly district; end whereas,
the harmony of our party will be materially
advanced by selecting as the addditional
County Committeeman one who is closely in
touch with his constituents, and in whom the
people of the district he represents have the
utmost confidence; therefore be it
Resolved, By the executive committee and
board of vice-presidents of the Thirty-fourth
Assembly District Central Republican Club
(acting for the club), that Charles H. Mayer be
and is hereby Indorsed as our choice for
County Committeeman to represent the lower
half of the Thirty-fourth Assembly District.
The Thirty-fourth District will leave no
stone unturned to give the Republican
nominees a handsome majority at the
coming election. They are organized for
battle and recognize in the present leaders
of the party men who are thoroughly im
bued with the principles of clean politics
and good government for the whole
people and not for those who live upon
political patronage alone.
A Partnership Quarrel.
James Eva and Samuel J. Eva have asked the
Superior Court to appoint a receiver for the
Fresno Fruit-Packing Company, alleging that
the corporation was hopelessly insolvent.
They further prayed that an injunction be
Issued restraining James Madison, A. F. Ten
ney and B. 11. Madison from borrowing money
with which to continue the business. All the
parties named are stockholders and directors
in the concern.

THE BOARD OF
HEALTH DEFIANT,
It Will Not Give Up Its
Inspection of
Vessels.
THE NEW BEGULATIONS
A Pointed Letter Sent to the
Marine Hospital
Service.
THE COMPONENTS OF A JEILY
What Mr. Wenzell Found in the
Few Samples Which He
Examined.
It looks very much as if the Board of
Health has thrown down the gantlet to
the Federal quarantine authorities, and
that it is the beginning of quite a con
tention.
There was read at a meeting of the board
yesterday a letter drawn up in answer to
a communication from the supervising
surgeon of the Marine Hospital Service,
informing the board that the local service
would hereafter do the quarantine inspec
tion instead of the City oliicers. The com
munication which will be sent in answer
is as follows:
San Francisco, July 1, 1896.
Walter Wyman, M.D., Supervising Surgeon-
General, if. H. S., Washington, Â£>. Câ Dear Sib:
We acknowledge receipt of your letter of the
20th lnst. to the president of this board,where
in you inform us ''beretoiore the boarding and
inspection of vessels arriving at San Francisco
from foreign ports has beeu permitted to be
continued by the local quarantine officer be
cause of the necessary delay in the construc
tion of the steamer, arid later because of the
lack of sufficient appropriation," and further
say that "the last Congress made appropria
tions sufficient to enable the service to per
form the entire quarantine function at the
port of San Francisco, "' and that "with the ap
proval of the Secretary of the Treasury you
are directed on July 1 or as soon thereafter as
practicable to begin the boarding and inspec
tion of all vessels requiring inspection."
In reply thereto we call your attention to
the plain language of the laws of the State of
California, under which this board was ap
pointed to carry out through its quarantine
officer the functions of boarding and inspect
ing vessels requiring such inspection.
These laws, section 3015, Caliiornia Politi
cal Code, require that "no person shall leave
or communicate with any vessel subject to
quarantine or examination by the Quarantine
Officer until the Quarantine Officer has
boarded her and given the necessary orders
and directions."
We are unable to find any warrant in any
provision of the United States statutes of April
29, 1878, August 1, 1888, or February 15,
1893, for the statement In your letter that this
inspection by the local Quarantine Officer
"has been permitted to be continued," or that
Congress appropriated moneys "to perform
the entire quarantine function at the port of
San Francisco."
On the contrary, the United States statute of
April 29, 1878. provides specially "that there
shall be no interference in any manner with
any quarantine laws or regulations as they
exist or may hereafter be adopted under State
laws."
We both believe and hope that our respective
duties may be carried out without friction,
and possibly to the greater efficiency of the
quarantine service, until the exclusive and
tremendous responsibility of safeguarding the
Nation's health fiom infectious diseases shall
have been finally fixed and determined.
Until we shall be absolved from our plain
duty under the laws of this State, a duty our
oath of office compels us to perform, we shall
do that duly so far as lies in our power.
You state you are acting under the instruc
tions of the honorable Secretary of the United
States Treasury ; we are acting under the com
manding laws of a sovereign State, and as her
officers sworn to maintain those laws we shall
attempt to enforce them so long as we are
charged with that duty.
In submitting the document Dr. Morse
said the law on the subject nad been thor
oughly looked up, and it was only after a
careful investigation of the subject that
the reply had been framed. The commu
nication was adopted by the board.
A communication was received from Mr.
Wenzell regarding certain analyses of
jeliies which he had made. His report
was interesting. Of eight samples which
he bad examined all were made from bad
fruit, and three had been colored with ani
line dyes. The currant jellies, of which
there were several samples, all showed the
presence of apples and aniline, and one
sample of strawberry jelly was shown to
be made from apples and turnip pulp.
The matter was placed in the hands of
Inspector iien Davis, and he was ordered
to arrest the sellers of the samples for vio
lation of ihe pure-food laws.
The charge against James McDonough,
of having fed the cows of his dairy on the
marshes off the San Bruno road was con
sidered.
Inspector Dockery testified that last
week he found a number of cows on the
marsh and ordered the Poundman to take
them. McDonough claimed some of the
cows- and a number of young men took
the cows from the Poundman. "Who nad
taken the cows he did not know or he
would have had them arrested. He had
had trouble over McDonougn's cows once
before. Market Inspector Davis corrobo
rated him.
Further hearing of the case was post
poned until next week.
Dr. H. Morrow was appointed an interne
at the City ana County Hospital in place
of Dr. N. M. McGilligan.
It was ordered that the Supervisors be
requested to appropriate $1500 for the pur
chase of instruments and fixings for the
Receiving Hospital.
The communication submitted to the
Grand Jury suggesting certain increases
in the force and expenses of the office was
read and approved.
There have been 5966 deaths during the
year, as against 6059 the year before. The
births as recorded were 5020, against 3755
of the preceding year. The casualties
numbered 183, the suicides 173, and homi
cides 27. Consumption claimed 1003, 77
less than the year before. Thirty of these
were under 15 years of age, and of this
thirty fourteen were under 3 years. These
are considered to be due to the impure
milk the board has been making such a
fight about. The increase in the death
rate is the first noticed in seven years.
The report of the plumbing inspector
took the form of a set of plumbing regu
lations such as are in use in Eastern cities.
They will add to the City's revenue a lit
tle, for under one of the regulations the
City is allowed to charge a fee for plumb
ing permits.
CLASH OF AUTHORITY.
Dr. Chalmers Determined to Act as
Quarantine Officer Until Re
moved by State Authority.
Dr. Chalmers, backed by the Board of
Health, is determined to oppose the action
of Surveyor-General Wyman of the Marine
Hospital service at Washington in ap
pointing Dr. Rosenau to act as Quarantine
Officer of the port.
Yesterday when the steamer City of
Everett arrived Dr. Chalmers promptly
boarded the vessel and got her Dill of
health.
The Everett then had to wait some time
for Dr. Rosenau's boat, the George M.
Sternberg, to come alongside. Dr. Rose
nau. of course, failed to get the ship's bill
of health, which was already in possession
of Dr. Chalmers.
Just what steps Dr. Rosenau will take to
establish his authority as Quarantine Of
ficer is a matter of conjecture.

PROTECTION THE GREAT
ISSUE IN CALIFORNIA,
Democrats and Republi
cans Say It's the
State's Salvation.
A CONVINCING ARGUMENT
FROM JAMES SPIERS.
Thomas Denigan, a Prominent Democratic
Wool Merchant, Gives Reasons for
Voting for Protection.
Tariff for protection is the battle-cry of
the Republican party ln California. The
question of financeâ silver and gold and bi
metallism â is subsidiary to the prosperity
of our industries, say ( the thinkers or both
parties.
The Call's plea for protection has been
taken up in every department of com
merce and industry, and KepuDlicans and
Democrats have piven it the support of
their sound political judgment. Many
Democrats who have never wavered in
their allegiance to the party have con
fessed themselves converted to the doc
trine of protection, and they are not afraid
to stand by their convictions, as may be
seen by a careful reading of The Call's
interviews.
Importers, manufacturers, wholesale
merchants and leading representatives of
the several departments of tra ;eand com
merce indorse tne policy of The Call and
say that the party which wins success in
California must make tariff and protec
tion the issue.
Thomas Denigan & Son.
"The Call certainly has hit the nail on
the head this time," quoth the head of
this large wool firm yesterday. "The
issue in California is most assuredly the

tariff and protection. The camp aign can
not be conducted on a money platform in
this State. We will have little need of
money it our wool -growers and manufac
turers are not able to do business at a
profit.
"I am a Democrat and have been a Dem
ocrat all my life, but 1 am bound to pro
tect my own interests, and all those inter
ests depend on a protective tariff. There
is no State in the Union that needs it more
than does California.
"I do not see how either ol the parties
can carry on a successful campaign in this
State on any other issue. To the most
superficial mind it must be obvious that a
difference in the price of wool of 26 and 13
cents and 12 and 4% cents isjof great mo
ment to the sheep- raisers. That is a "tart
ling drop in each case. Ohio XX sold for
26 cents before the passage of the Wilson
bill, and now it is on the market for 13.
California wools Dave gone down on the
same ratio. I sold hundreds of tons this
sprine for 4% cents. That is the Wilson
tariff. The farmers and sheep - raisers
throughout the United States know it.
They would be blind if they did not. We
all can see it, irrespective of partisan bias.
"Of course, there is a difference between
the Eastern and Western wool-growers.
The California wool - grower, generally
speaking, has 5000 head of sheep, or 10,000
acres of land. He makes it his sole and
exclusive business. In the Middle and
Eastern States, the farmers have 100 head
of sheep, and look upon their raising as a
side issue. Here sheep-raising is the only
source of revenue to those engaged in the
industry. It can readily be understood
that the tariff is of much greater import
ance to the California wooJ-grower than to
the farmers in the East, wno look on their
sheep as a source of pin-money. There
had been a downward trend in the price of
wool for some time prior to the passage of
the Wilson bill, but when that tariff law
took effect, it hastened the inevitable.
W T ool can be grown at a profit, it is said,
for 8. 10 or 12 cents, but the Wilson bill
leaves the grower a margin on the wrong
side of the profit line.
"But returning to California, I should
think any fair and sound minded man
could see that the tariff is vital to our in
terests. It might be saU that in many j
respects we occupy a position not dissimi
lar to that of tiie United States to the
foreign countries. We are cut off from
the East by distance and from a Western
market by a broad expanse of water. The
lack of railway competition hampers us
still further."
Francis Smith & Co.
Tbis firm is one of the most extensive
manufacturers of iron pipe on the Pacific
Coast and Mr. Smith is as stanch a Re
publican ana as strong a protectionist as
can be found in any State of the Union.
"Let it go with a hurrah," he said, when
asked concerning his views as to the issue
in California. "Protection by all means.
What do we care for the money question
unless we have some use for the money in
carrying on our manufacturing industries?
The Call has taken the only true Repub
lican position. To California there can be
i no other vital issue at the present time ex
cept protection. I can give you an instance
illustrative of our great need for a protec
tive tariff. Last year I had occasion to
figure on a big contract in Mexico. It
amounted up to the thousands.
"I sent a man down to figure on the con
i tract and it was all but within our grasp
i when an English firm heard of the job and
underbid us. We cannot possibly compete
with the manufacturers of other countries
unless we have a tariff to protect us and
equalize the disparity existing between
i the wages of this country and those of
I Europe. The foreign countries can under
sell us in any market of the world unless
there is something done to give us a fight
ing chance with the cheap-labor countries.
Of course, the issue in California is the
tariff and protection, but the laboring men
do not appreciate the fact. They are easily
won over by the catchword of free silver,
1 and think their pockets will be lined with
the white metal if bimetallism prevails.
"Before the last election l called all my
men together and gave them a strong
talk. 1 explained the manufacturers'
position and endeavored to show them
that unless the manufacturer was able to

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JULY 2, 1896.
VIEWS OF A PROMINENT CITIZEN ON THE LEADING ISSUES OF THE DAY.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL :
DEAR SIR: The good book says, "There is a time for all things," and I think now is the best time for our citizens to
express their views in regard to matters of vital importance to the welfare and prosperity of our country, so that those to
whom we confide our interests in governing our affairs during the next four years will know our wants and what in our
varied experience we think is best for ourselves.
For the last few years there has been a great stagnation in business, due, 1 believe, to the working on a high plane */f
cost while competing, and in a large measure unprotected, with the low-priced labor of Europe, parsimony on the part of our
Government in its expenditure for public works and uncertainty.
This country possesses practically everything to meet ail the wants of Its own people. No other country is so favored,
either as regards food products, material and resources for manufacture, brain power or education. With such conditions we
require practically nothing from other countries, more especially their manufactures produced by cheap labor, and from which it is
very important to our interests that we be protected. Free trade simply means low wages to the wage-earner, the draining of our
gold from the country to pay for cheap-labor goods, the wage-earner buying cheap clothing, goods, underwear, etc., and our own
woolen-mills, boot and shoe makers, tailors, etc., going idle or submitting to foreign pauper wages, our shipping going out of
existence, and its workmen submitting to the same fate. Qur coastwise trade would pass into the hands of Europeans, English
vessels manned by European and Asiatic crews and engineers taking charge of the little freight we might have (which under these
conditions would be very little), and nearly all the freight money and wages would be sent abroad. Even now some of the
patriotic Americans are using English vessels where they can put them into foreign trade, to the loss of our American builders.
Protection in regard to shipping for this coast particularly, as well as the Atlantic, means employment to the wage
earner and manufacturer. It means labor in our forests, cutting down the trees, hauling and the manufacturing of the same
into lumber at our sawmills, the building of our sailing vessels and steamers that trade on the coast, carrying the lumber and
other products to our markets. Without protection, these vessels would be consigned to the "boneyard," and we would be "kill
ing the goose that lays the golden egg."
California and the Pacific States require protection much more than the Atlantic States ; in fact, they need protection from
the Atlantic, just as the whole country does from the cheaper labor of other countries, because of the higher cost of material and
labor paid here. If a tariff could be put on everything crossing the country, our condition would be improved. This, however, is
now slowly equalizing, and when it is nearly so, our prosperity will begin.
In regard to public works our Government has been very parsimonious and exceedingly considerate(P) of the taxes of our
poor people. Were the Creator to stop evaporation from taking up and the clouds from releasing the water that refreshes the
earth for the reason that it would be too much of a tax on the sun he would be just as consistent as is the policy of our present
Government. Good circulation is necessary for health. Our navy and our fortifications ought to be largely and intelligently in
creased. With such the country will command respect everywhere. Our harbors and navigation should be generously and in
telligently increased. Improvements in the way of public buildings should be made to take the place of our old moldy oi!ts, and
all these things should be done, more particularly while times are dull, so as to give employment to labor and at the same time
stimulate other enterprises. By doing so the tax on the poor man, about which the present Government is so solicitous, will be
returned to him by constant instead of occasional labor, and the dollars which our presenCGovemment seems to think will be
wasted in such use will still exist in a circulating and healthy way through the pockets of the workingman and manufacturerâ
not getting rusty, but doing good as they passed along, like the rains of heaven falling upon the earth, refreshing it as they pass
into our rivers. What we want is circulation, not stagnation.
In regard to Trusts taking advantage of protection, and that fact used as an argument against protection, I will say that
the trouble is not in protection, but in the trusts ; if against the public good, make trusts illegal ; if not, put them under such
conditions that protection will not be abused.
Our Government ought to have a steady policy; changes, as a rule, should be made gradually; uncertainty destroys
confidence, and lack of confidence demoralizes' trade. I give the sugar bounty as an illustration of uncertainty.
Now, Mr. Editor, 1 very earnestly advocate proper protection for our products and our manufactures, an increase of our
navy and fortifications, as well as of our public works generally, and no uncertain, but a wise and steady policy of our Govern
ment, so as to secure confidence. I am, yours very respectfully, JAMES SPIERS.
cvi table, and our poorer classes will be out
in the cold."
Stewart A Co.
"The Call is right so far as the Califor
nia issue is concerned," remarked Mr.
Watkins. "The protection of our home in
dustries is far more important to the vot
ers of the State than the money question.
Yes, there has been a perceptible differ
ence under the two tariffs, but I cannot
recall any startling instance that rould
serve as an illustration. The State cer
tainly needs protection first, though I be
lieve the finance issue is of great im
portance."
Minaker A Wells.
This firm 13 extens ely engaeed in
handline fruits affected by the tariff, such
as prunes, raisins, etc. Mr. Minaker said:
"By all means is the tariff the leading
issue in California. No one can consider
the great depression in prices during the
last two years in our staple dried fruits
and not admit that the tariff certainly has
something to do with our market. This
spring and early summer I sold several
tons of peaches for 2% cpnts that cost the
producer 3 cfnts. That is but one of the
hundred incidents that the handlers and
raisers of fruit could give you.
"It is the same with raisins and prunes.
There has got to be a change, and 1 think
McKinley can bring what we want. The
whole country has felt the effect of the
depression, and while the Eastern and
Middle States may quibble over the
money question, California's political in
terest lies wholly in a tariff for protection
to her people engaged in fruit-raisine,
wine-making and the various manufactur
ing industries. But I almost despair of
ever enlightening the masses on these
two very grave questions of tariff and
money. They do not understand them.
A catchword like free silver has a power
ful influence over the average voter. Some
of them even go so far as to say if there is
free silver there will be dollars in every
poor man's pocket.
"Others seem to think the dimes, quar
ters and half-dollars will be found in the
gutter streams. Since this last silver cry
arose I had a man whom I was desirous of
helping, and whose family had suffered
because of his having been out of work
for several weeks, leave his job with me
because the wage was only $2 s day. I
put him on when I did not need him and
it was an easy shift, but at the end of the
week, when < I paid him off at the rate of
$2 a day, he became very indignant and
| said he could not work for $2 a dayâ there
i was going vto be free silver. When such
1 ignorance prevails can you wonder that so
many of the laboring classes ' are suffer
ing? If they could appreciate the grave
importance of the tariff issue in Califor
nia they would work and have honest
money in their pockets instead of waiting
for silver coins to go rolling down the
pavements." .

WILL SMITH AND
GALLAGHER BOX?
Civic Federation Not Certain
Legal Action Can Be
Taken.
I. J. TRUMAN'S THOUGHTS
Advance Sale of Seats Continues
Rapidly Up to the
Present.
" YOUNG " MITCHELL CONFIDENT
Skillful Hand of the National Club
Believed to Be Behind the
Agitation.
The question of all-absorbing interest in
the sporting world at present is, "Can the
Civic Federation stop the Smith-Gallagher
mill?" The question was widely discussed
yesterday, both in the various sporting re
sorts and on the street.
All those who are friendly toward the
| contest booked for to-nigiit, and they seem
' by far in the majority, are strong in their
; belief that the Civic Federation has no
authority in the matter. Their arguments
in favor of this view are many and varied.
In the first place, they say, the contest
is not a prize tight, but a scientific boxing
match of a limited number of rounds, and
as such does not come within the pale of
tne law. Both men, they assert, are scien
tific fighters and pretty evenly matched.
This fact in itself is taken as a pretty good
argument that a knockout, or even any
brutality, in ten rounds is very improb
able.
Then, again, the authority of the Federa
tion to put a quietuse tvs on the event is
thought to amount to nothing, as evinced
by their inability to stop the Sharkey-
Corbettbout. It is claimed that a ma
jority of the members present on this oc
casion returned a favorable report, but
that the minority report was adopted.
I. J. Truman of the Civic Federation
talked freely upon the statns of the case.
'"Stewart Menzies and I were appointed
1 a committee to see what could be done in
the matter," he said, "but so far both of
us have been too busily engrossed with our
business affairs to give the subject the time
and attention its importance demands.
To-morrow, however, we are going to see
what we can do."
"Do you think yon can atop the fight?"
"Well," replied Truman, "we think wÂ«
can. Our attorneys are also of that opin
ion. Ol course we do not know for cer
tain."
"Wherin do you think the infraction of
law exists?"
"In the fact that it is nothing more nor
less than a prize fight. In such engage
ments a man may knock his opponent
out in one round. Aeain.it might^atce
many rounds before this would happen."
Young Mitchell was also seen and asked
for his opinion of the outcome.
"You may tell the public that this con
test is Eoing to take place as scheduled,"
he replied. "We have our license for the
event, and there is no legal action that
can in any way interfere with us.
"We have seen the best legal talent in
the City on the merits of the case, and in
each instance have been advised that we
are in no wise infracting the law, ana can
not be hindered in our course.
"The advance sale of seats for the ex
| hibition has been very large, and continues
so up to the present time. Some of the
Best citizens in the community have pur
chased tickets already, and we have orders
from many more. Nothing will occur that
can shock the sensibilities of the most fas
| tidious, as the men are scientific fighters '
i and are going to box for a limited number
of rounds only.
"As I said before, we have every assur
ance from those wbo are in a position to
know that we will not be interfered with.
Anyway, there can be no reason for any
interference.' 1
Another member of the Civic Federa
tion said yesterday that the National Club
had assured the organization that the
BÂ»iarkey-Corbett fight would be purely j
scientific, but had counted with ut their
Sharkey, who fought like an engraged
animal, threw his opponent and

the referee flat, and even tried
to down the police when they inter
fered. Whether this would occur in the
coming battle, he was necessarily unable
to prognosticate.
Many are of the opinion that the Na
tional Club is at the back of the present
agitation and that the intention is to de
stroy the advance sale of seats so' as
to damage the New Occidental Club finan
cially. This the members of that organi
zation naturally deny with vigor.
The idea is also advanced that it would
be unjust to have permitted the National
Club to draw off their events and then to
interfere with the younger leacue. It
would be in consonance with equity and
right, it is argued, to give one club the
same right as the other.
As the matter stands, the Civic Federa
tion does not feel sura that tne contest
can be prevented, while the New Occi
dental Club, acting upon competent legal
advice, feels sure thst there are no obsta
cles in its path. The license for the con
test is in its possession and the sale of
seats rapidly continues.
CONSIDERED THE RULES.
Preparing for thÂ« Meeting of the
Board of Education
To-Day.
The committee on rules of the Board of
Education held a lengthy meeting last
evening in order to prepare recommenda
tions which will be submitted to the board
meeting to be held to-day.
Thomas Knox, chairman of the commit
tee, presided, but there was more than the
committee members present for him to
preside over. In fact, all but two of the
members of the board were present. The
entire session was devoted to discussing
revising and extending the rules already
in force, and the result of the meeting will
be told in the committee's report made to
day.
HE OFTEN SENT FOR HER
Baldwin Was Unwell and
Wanted Lillian Ashley to
Nurse Him.
The Testimony of Wood and O'Keefe
Deniedâ The Term "Double
Dealing" Allowed.
The last session of the Ashley-Baldwin
trial will come to a close this mornine, and
thaourtain will go down on the drama.
TneMefendant has fought the girl-plaintiff
to the last. Out in the anteroom his peo
ple sat late last night and waited for an
opportunity to testify.
O'Keefe, the horse-jockey, messenger
boy and general factotum of somebody in
Boston, was waiting to tell more regarding
the plaintiff's past, for $8 a week.
The morning session began with An
drew Anderson on the witness stand, and
the defendant's counsel noted the fact
that all allusion to the "cottage" incident,
where the witness testified that he saw
Baldwin and Miss Ashley together, did
not appear in the memorandum-book.
Attorney Crittenden made an effort to
bring^ out the fact of Baldwin's having en
tertained Mrs. Richards, or Reilly, and
her daughter Bessie at Santa Anita, and
also that Mrs. Richards and her daughter
had brought about a settlement with
Baldwin on the basis of $35,000. The
question was objected to and the objection
sustained.
Anderson was also asked about a "little
girl" who was alleged to have been chape
roned by E. J. Baldwin at the St. Louis
races, but he was not permitted to answer
the question.
Miss Emma Ashley, sister of the plain
tiff, on the stand told of Lillian's accident
by a fall from a sleigh and her illness
from that cause lasting for several months.
E. Porter Ashley, brother of the plaint
iff, testified that whiie he and his sister
were at the Santa Anita rancn Baldwin
wanted the A.shleys to come over and live
at the adobe house, and Lillian had re
fused, saying that Baldwin had two dis
reputable women there and she would not
associate with them. He also stated that
Baldwin bad said, "Oh, never mind them
come anyhow."
Ashley was asked regarding the "Falvey
joke" and the alleg d efforts made by
Baldwin to "put Lillian's baby on him "
He also explained how Baldwin's daugh
ter Clara had insinuated that Falvev and
Miss Ashley were engaged. He stated
that his sister had often addressed Bald
win as "papa," and he had answered in
"a loving manner." Baldwin often sent
for her to come to his room as be was un
well and he had seen the defendant go to
her room many times.
He went to the hotel in this City because
Baldwin had promised him a position
there, but had not kept that promise
The witness testified that 'while at the
hotel he received the following telegram
which was from Baldwin to his sister Lil
lian, relating to their remaining in the |
hotel:
Fresno Depot, May 17, 1893.
ToMits Lillian Ashley, care Conductor No. 19:
Stay there until you get ready to fro, and if
either one of them trouble you they will get
out. E. J. Baldwin.
The plaintiff was put on the stand to
testify regarding her interviews with
Wood and O'Keefe; also regarding the
testimony they i;ave concerning her ill
ness subsequent to her accident.
She denied specifically the allegations of '
those two witnesses, and told in detail
how Wood, while in the employ of Bald
win, and after he haa betrayed Miss Ash
ley's case, had cotne to her with advice to
compromise. Mr. <JrittÂ«nden, in speak
ing of the action of Wood, used
the term "double-dealing," ana it
was objected to by fne defense on the
ground that it was insulting to that per
son. Judge Slack overruled the objection
and the term "double dealing" was allowed.
The case will be submitted this morning.

It is an alarming fact that three-fourths

result in physical wreck. These poor vic-

humiliation, silently suffer on, going from
bad to worse, until death closes the sad
scene. Muscular strength and manly
power are both based upon the one condi-

health all the essential organs of the body
are capable of performing their functions

Distressing Thonghts.
It is a distressing thought to learn from
medical statistics that seven-tenths of the
women of this vast country are suffering
from some chronic ailment, and in most
cases that ailment is peculiar to her sex.
With that fortitude which only the true
woman possesses, she uncomplainingly
suffers on day after day, ye*, year after
year, with the false hope that nature will
some time remedy her trouble and restore
her health. With the great love for beauty
which every woman desires. >he, with
paints, powders and lotions, tries in vuin
to cover up the lines and defects which the
cruel work of disease has wrought in her
once beautiful face. There is but one foun-
dation for beauty, and that is heath.
Health produces a mind teeming with wit,
the bright, sparkling eye. the rosy ch^ek
and the plump and well-rounded form.
With health the whole world is a world of
sunshine. With disease it is a dark-
gloomy, prison-like abode.

A Daily Italian News
paper With a Large
Circulation.
TO LABOR FAITHFULLY.
Considers the Movement "A
Manifestation of Human
Progress."
G. ALMAGIA TELLS HIS VIEWS.
Aa Ardent Manifesto That Praises
the Foresight of the Repub
lican Parly.
L'ltalia, a daily San Francisco news
paper, with a large circulation both in
this City and throughout the State, will '
G. Almagia. the Italian Editor Who Has Declared for Woman Suffrage.
this afternoon declare itself to be an advo
cate of woman's suffrage.
L'ltalia, as its name implies, is pub
lished in the Italian tongue. It is astancn
Ptepublican organ, and considers it the
duty of a Republican newspaper to uphold
the plank which was adopted at the Sac
ramento convention. In addition to this,
its editors are also personally in sympathy
with the .suffrage movement. Something
of the paper's influence may be gathered
from ihe fact that it recently started a
subscription for the widows and orphans
of soldier-) who had fallen in Abyssinia.
Most of the subscribers were laboring men
who sent their mite, often small as lOcents,
but the money poured in from all parts of
the State, and the Minister of War has
already acknowledged the receipt from
L'ltalias fund of $3000.
Most of those contributors are voters,
and there is little doubt but that many of
them will be swayed to vote for the amend
ment by L'lialia's action.
The following is a translation of the
manifesto which L'ltalia will publish this
afternoon on the suffrage question:
"In the programme of tne great Repub
lican party, accepted at the convention of
St. Louis, a prominent part is devoted to
the rights of women.
"After tne progressive movement which
in these latter years has been manifested iv
the feminine ranks, and especially after
the Chicago Exposition, it had become im
possible, or at least impolitic, not to keep
calculation of the movement, and there
fore, according to us, the Republican
party did well to externl the hand to the
feminine committee that was marvelousiy
organized to obtain those rights, civil
and political, that have hitherto been de
nied to women. In the above-mentioned
programme it is said : 'We favor the ad
mission of women into the vaster spheres
of utility and well-being, and appreciate
their co-operation in liberating the coun
try from tbe bad government of the Dem
ocrats and Populists.'
"Without entering into the merits of the
somewhat partisan considerations of this
paragraph â to use women to liberate the
country from the bad government of the
Democrats and Populists â because it reads
like a rhetorical Dhrase, and nothing more,
we entirely accept the idea that woman,
she has the right to vote and be
elected to cflice,can become a most piecious
element in tne municipal administration,
in charitable work, and in time also in the
legislative balls of both State and Nation.
"One can understand that in old Europe,
where the higher studies are almost ex
clusively conducted by men.it is a very
difficult problem to give suffrage to
woman; but here in tbe United States,
where doctors, lawyer? :ind professors of
the feminine sex abound; here in this
country where woman has known how to
acquire offices ami employments before
held exclusive;}' by men, it is becoming
an absolute necessity to keep count of
feminine demands.
"The Bt. Louis convention well under
stood this, und from tho support of the
feminine societies much force is already
being acquired towurd the definite, ulti
mate victory of the party, even though
that support is at present only indirect.
"To delude one's* self with tiie belief that
the feminine movement can be arrested
is a blind idea, because the movement
prows each day, and woman (it is impossi
ble to deny it) is endowed with a tenacity
and a fore* of will stronger than that of
man.
"The sacrifices of which sÂ»he is capable
as mother, sister and wife, her attachment
to home, the domestic economy of which
she i 3 master, are facts that cannot be de
nied and that give safe assurance that also
in a wider field, such as public adminis
tration, she would be ot incalculable
benefit.
"Corruption, the fretting moth of every
form of government, would find a restraint
in her because woman is more moral than
man.
"Socialism is much under discussion to
day and ao many high intellects are con
verted to the new faith that it becomes
iale to dispute whether one should con
cede the right of voting to women. He
who does not fear the greater should not
fear the less. He who does not recoil at
the idea o! the abolition of the marriage
contract should not frown upon the Idea
of seeing a feminine deputation at the
Senate. Thus the Republican party, which
is, above all others, conservative, has un
derstood that feminine suffrage would
form a barrier against the subversion of
the existing order of things and that
woman by her special aptitudes of heart
would, more than man. interest herself in
the well-being of the masses and would
know how to do it in a way that all would
come within the limits of the consti
tution.
"We declare ourselves knights of suffrage
without, however, rushing into exaggera
te salute with sympathy the move
ment and will assist faithfully toward
this new manifestation of human prog
ress.''
When asked yesterday to express his
views on the subject tiie editor. G. Alma
gia, said:
"For many reasons I am in favor of
women in America being granted the fran
chise. I make ihe distinction 'in Amer
ica' because in some of the southern Euro
pean countries woman has been enslaved
for so Jong that she is not quite ready for
franchise, though in Italy, and especially
in Northern Italy, our women are making
gigantic strides forward.
"Matilda Serao is one of the most bril
liant journalists in. Italy. In partnership
with her husband she is Droprietor of the
newspaper 11 Mattino, and helps most suc
cessfully to direct its policy. One of the
brightest attorneys-at-law in Turin is Miss
Poet, and I might give many other in
stances of Italian women who are showing
their intellectual equality with men.
"In the far south women, although per
mitted to toil in the fields and labor like
men, have been enslaved for so long that
they have not yet begun to thinic for them
selves. This enslavement I attribute to
the centuries of Spanish dominion to
which Southern Italy was subjected,
and the Spanish learned from the bar
barous Moors to regard women as infe
riors. One of the arguments used against
lettinp women have a voice in the conduct
of affairs is that they would soon be usurp
ing the work done by men. People who
reason in this way seem to forget that it
: is always among barbarous nations that
' women perform most of the labor that in
| civilized lands is done by men. The Arab
feels no shame at sitting at his ease while
the women toil.
"I believe as women are naturally more
J conservative than men. women would form
i in public life a sort of barrier against tho
! modern tendency to overthrow existing
institutions. They are also more religious
than men, more attached to the home and
are more interested than men in maintain
ing everything that supports and upholds
it. Women arc also more economical
than men, and 1 believe that they would
carry into the administration of municipal
affairs the same prudence and economy
that they show in managing their own
domestic affair?.
â¢'lt is absurd to talk as if giving women
the franchise would cause the whole
female population of the country to attend
to nothing but politics. A few might be
I chosen to be put forward prominently,
I but they would form a small minority.
If my wife were given the right to vote I
ehouid not expect to see her scut at once
to the Senate or to Congress.
"Women rind time to go to balls, con
certs, theaters and other amusements;
they even find time to co away on a sum
mer vacation, and no one laments that the
home is being neglected. Burely they
could spare an hour to register a vote, and
a little time devoted to the study of cur
rent events would not be any more time
taken from the home than if they were
reading novels or attending reception-.
"There is so much prejudice in these
things," continued the editor of L'ltalia.
"A few centuries ago it would have been
considered an unwomanly thing for a
I female to appear upon the stage. She is
not considered now to lose her womanly
dignity by doing so. Even titty years ago
a female lawyer or doctor would have been
looked upon with horror. She is taken aa
j a matter ot course now."
Mr. Almagia said that it was far from
him to desire to see women apiug men in
dress and trifling externals of manner; he
believed that the most truly feminine
woman, who seriously and philanthropic
aliy devoted herself to public affairs, would
have the most influence. He also said
that he would like to see tne noble, self
devoted women, who in Italy and else
where shut themselves up in convents,
turning their consecrated lives instead to
entire devotion to public affairs.
"If women had had a voice, Europe
would have acted more nobly on the Ar
menian question. It is my belief that the
day in which woman enters into her ahare
of the Government the abolition of war
will no longer be a dream, but will be
possible ai. a reality."
E. Patrizi, joint editor of L'ltalia, has
always been an ardent suffragist, and in
Milan was prominently connected witn
the movement.
L'ltalia publishes a weekly supplement,
La Vita, and in that paper a series of
special articles will appear on ti.e suffrage
movement, both here and in Europe. The
suffragists are enthusiastic over the action
of L'ltalia, and at headquarters it is in
tended to follow it up by the organization
of a North Beach Woman's Suffrage Club.

MANHOOD!
The Most Precious Ele-
ment of Our Physical
Being. You Do Not
Know How to Appre-
ciate It.
When a man is broken
down in his vital powers as
a rule he is not the only one
who suffers. Others, family, j
friends, those who enjoy his
company and protection, no-
tice the depression in his
spirits, the lack of ambition, I
dogged disposition, nagging,
irritable temperament. It
makes all who come in con-
tact with him unhappy.
Let the reader understand !
that all this misery comes !
from the loss of nerve foree â !
that, element which is the j
well spring of all joy, of all
mental and physical pleas- ;
ure. It is the loss of this !
nerve force that leaves the \
mind and body weak, and L
causes the sufferer to feel
that the best of his life has
been spent.
J To replace the force and j
strength of the nerves we
must use Electricity â not ;
drugs â as Electricity forms
the basis of all animal life .
It is the nerve force, the life
of the nerves, and the life of
all nervous and vital organs
increases when Electricity is
applied in mild, soothing
currents, as it is from Dr.
Sanden's Electric Belt.
It is hard to convince some
people of the value of this
great Electric Belt, for every
sufferer knows too well the
great amount of fraud and
deception which is practiced
by makers of a cheap grade j
of belts, and how these char- j
latans impose them on the
public with the announce-
ment that they are "as good"
as Dr. Sanden's.
The following are ex- 1
tracts from letters recently I
received :
"I suppose you will be glad to hear that
lam cured of ray emissions. I haven't
been bothered any for the past month,
and am feeling extremely well. I can't
say too much for you in your attention to
your patients. I leel that my losses have
entirely ceased. Thanking yon for the
good you have done me, I am, yours truly,
Lesley Crawford, Largo, Cal." ;. ;. â¢
"Having suffered for a period of three
years from muscular rheumatism and
having tried all kinds of known remedies
to no avail, a friend of mine advised me to ;
get an Electric Belt, so 1 bought one of
your No. 6 strong power belts, and after
wearing it for about three months the'
rheumatism bus entirely left me. I will
cheerfully recommend your Belt to all
sufferers from rheumatism." Michael
Maloney, Keswick. Shasta County, Cal. .
"On receipt of your Belt I was requested
to report in thirty days, and, I therefore i
let yon know how I am getting along. 1 1
must pay that the results are away beyond
my expectations, and 1 now believe in the
wonderful power of the Belt. I notice an
improvement all over my body, and es-
pecially the varicocele, which before I wore
the belt were . iarqc , swollen veins, are
almost entirely and completely disap-
peared, and the seminal weakness which
I have suffered from for a long time has
entirely disappeared. . I am now as strong |
in.that particular as I wish to be. I wish
you to publish this letter that other suf-
ferers may profit by my experience." N.
Damato, Penryn, Cat. 'â¢ . '
Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt
will positively cure all weak-
ness arising from early
habits or later excesses. If
you are weak you owe it to
yourself, to your family and
friends and those who will
look to you for a heritage of
health, to cure yourself now.

Belt to-day.

THE FRUIT EXCHANGE.
The San Francisco Fruit Exchange has Issued
the following circular to members:
â As the exchange is on the eve of its election for
officers and annual meeting it has been thought
best before that time arrivesâ 14 for the elec
tion and July 15 for the meeting'â to call a general
meeting of members to hear expressions as to the
manner of procedure to be adopted for the coming
s?<ison and to confer as to the welfare of the ex
change in a general way. There is no manner of
doubtastothe usefulness of the exchange If the
members themselves will come to some tacit and
binding understanding to protect their own inter
ests and that of fruit-dealers generally throughout
the State. The Influence of the exchange abroad
ban been greater than it has been given credit tor
at home, and 11 only remains to form a compact
body, to work under rules already adopted par
ticularly that part of them relating to grades in
spections and contracts, to overcome the reckless
and diversified systems In vogue, by which no sin
gle individual or firm, shipper, grower or packer
can obtain his proper and just share of profit.
We want your individual and concerted advice
at Â» meeting to be held on Thursday. July 2, 1896

M.W YORK MARKETS.
Financial.
NFV/ YORK. N. V.. July I.â Stocks to-day
.were lower. At the opening the market lacked
the foreign support which has been such a con
spcuous feature of late and professional traders
bearishly inclined put out additional short lines.
Local bull operators who are apparently discour
aged by the strength of the free silver men at
Chicago and the reports that the Altgeld contin
gent will not only write the platform for the De
mocracy, but name the Presidential candidate as
well, discourage and did little or nothing to stem
the downward movement. Several clever manip
ulators forced the pace and a firm credited with
acting for politicians of national repute also sold
liberal amounts of the standard railway Issues
and the industrials. A report that two or three
millions of cold would be forwarded to Eurooe
Saturday could not be verified. "Â»Â«f^

CHICAGO MAKKKTS.
CHICAGO, Ir.i~ July I.â ln recollection of yes
terday's firmness in wheat there was some buying
of that grain this morning, and a want of confi
dence on the part of the bears. The conditions
rendered the tone rather st ady for a time, and
prices rose about %c from the opening or ss4c
above the final quotations of yesterday. Gradually,
however, the feeling became more disposed to
weakness, and offerings met with a less ready* re
sponse. Values shrank away, and later In the
morning the entire appreciation before mention*
disappeared. The Orange-Judd Farmer issued its
monthly report giving the condition of wheat at
79.7 and of spring at 92.0. This was interpreted
as favorable to the crop, although showing some
deterioration for the month. Receipts in the
Northwest were heavy at 410 cars against 371
last Wednesday and 163 a year Chicago re
ceived 18 cars and inspected out 45,733 bushels.
Liverpool cables were firm and a^d higher. De
liveries on July contracts to day were very light.
Weakness in New York stocks was aconsliera
tlon in the grain markets, aggravating the depres
sion to a. great extent Closing Berlin cable 3 were
blgner, and other continental markets were un
changed. Export clearances aggregated 211,175
bushels. September wheat opened from 67c
to 6714 c, sold between 67%cand 66c, closing at
the Inside. *Â£<: under yesterday. Estimated re
ceipts for to-morrow 12 cars.
CORNâ Trading did not assume any particular
prominence or Importance. The action was Iden
tical with that of its more influential neighbor,
wneat, but as the volume of trade waÂ» lighter the
range of prices as naturally narrower. Receipts
were 430 cars, and 177,Â»88 oushels were taKen
from store. The Orange- Judd Farmer gave the
condition of the Corn crop as 92 per cent, and the
acreage at 81.702,000. Export clearances
amounted to 196,J87 bushels. September Corn
opened at 28c, sold between -'Hy 8 and 27&/uc

HIS STANDING NOW IN DOUBT
Dppcaeuts Say That He Has Rebelled
Against the Church and Is

908 Broadway, July 1. )
It is not unlikely that Rev. A. C. Bane
may return to Oakland aud be offered an
ReT. a. C. Bane, Who Is in Conflict With the M. E. Church South Conference.
evangelical church. Among his numerous
friends the idea is general that he is not
v, anted in the Methodist Chu:ch South,
and that all the changes to which he has
Deen subjected are but part of a plan to
bring about his severance from that organ
isation.
About three years ago Rev. Mr. Bane
was pastor of the M. E. Church South in
Oakland. He was very popular, and there
was a great deal of dissatisfaction shown
when he was removed. A trustee of the
Asbury Church South made the following
explanation of affairs to-day :
"Mr. Bane has undoubtedly come under
the ban of those rrembers who dominate
the conference," he said, "and everybody
here is interested in the outcome. Few
ministers that have been in Oakland have
had more friends. He was a Mason, an
Elk, a Workman, an Odd Fellow, and was,
besides, a powerful preacher. From Oak
land he was transferred to tne lar^e Trin
ity Church at Los Angeles. There he
worked as hard as ever, and created so
much interest that, we believe, some of his
brethren in this conference rather envied
him, and decided that it would be a good
thing to dampen his ardor somewhat.
Bane became aware oi this, and he applied
to the conference for permission to become
a local preacher without a definite assign
ment. This was denied him, as he wanted
to be an evangelist, and the If. E. Church
South is not friendly to evangelists.
"After this he was sent to a little church,
where he receive*! about $400 a year, at
San Diego. His friends here believe he
was sent there in the hope that he would
rebel and so take himself out of the
church. At San Diego he soon built up
such a large congregation that he was
iorced to hire a large hall, as his church
was inadequate to the membership. He
chafed under restraint, however, and
said that if the conference would not let
him go, he would be forced to go. This
was just what was wanted, but Mr. Bane
did not oblige his opponents so readily.
and now there is some doubt as to his
standing. He seems to have left his
church, but his friendÃ say that he lifts
gone on a vacation eranted by the congre
gation, while his opponents declare that
he has rebelLed against the government of
the church, and has done what his enemies
In the conference wanted him to do. We ex
pect him in Oakland shortly, and be would
have no difficulty in quickly organizing
an independent church."
A YEAR ON A DOLLAR,
Mayor Davie Congratulates Him
self on the Result of the
Experiment
More Work Has Baen Done During
the Year Than During Any
Previous Year.
Oakland Office San Fbancipco Call,}
908 Broadway, July 1. j
Mayor Davie was poring over figures to
day. The first fiscal year that has been
conducted with a dollar tax levy closed
last night and the Mayor is like the
farmers at raintimeâ jubilant.
"Of all pieces of monumental stupidity,"
said the Mayor, "the estimate of Chief
Fair of $127,000 for his department is the
most absurd. The city is in a good condi
tion and the little gallery playing of the
School Board ana the Library Trustees
will hurt nobody.
"I am more than satisfied with the re
sults of la6t year's work. Tne experi
ment has gone tbrouph and clearly dem
onstrated that the city can be conducted
and well conducted, on a dollar limit, if
the money is judiciously expended.
Frcm the start the head of every
department, cave the Health Office
and George Carlton of tne Electric
Department, has lough t the measure and
done everything to make it unpopular, i
If they bad at first settled down to the
fact that we had so much money to
spend, and worked with me to make
every cent count, more things could have
been done. Remember, the city had Deen
run on an extravagant basis for the four
months before the tax levy was fixed, and
still if the $23,000 had not been taken from
the street-light fund â a thing which
legally could not have been done â we
would have had that money left as a sur
plus or exnended it repairing streets and
keeping open the Hikfh School and read
ing-rooms. The Board of Education got
more money t.ian it needed, as is demon
strated by its having enough left to equip
a Manuai Training School. More work
has, I believe, been done during the past
year than the year previous. Nearly
every cftice in the building has been beau
tifully relitted, the engine hou-es have
been repaired, sewers extended, streets
kept up, the garbage removed, and it is all
humbug to Bay that it was not well done.
Another thine. When I came into office,
which was three months beiore the ending
of the year 1894-95 we had had a nigh tax
rate and yet one of the first things I
learned was that a deficit of $15,000 was ex
pected. We did absolutely nothing those
three months to save money enough to
come out even. This year we have worked
right up to the last. _We have money
enough to pay our bills."

9:40 o'clock this morning a passenger, sup
posed to be A.Chamberlain of Bishop, Inyo
County, fell from the steps of the Los Ang

Mojave.
K. If. F. Felton was the only eye-witness
to the accident. He said: "I was stand
ing at the front door of the third car and
noticed deceased acting strangely in the
rear end of the second car. He came out
upon the platform and stood with one foot
on the bottom 3tep and the other one step
up. He let go with one hand and was just
in the act of waving when he lurched for
ward and fell, striking the ground face
down."

l has been comfortably quartered at Fabiola
I Hospital until arrangements can be com
! pleted to place her permanently in one of
the homes for Indigent army nurses like
I that supported in Santa Clara County by
the Women's Relief Corps. Mrs. Sarah

Mrs. Butler was born in Tennessee and
; married a West Point graduate named
Haward Morton. He was wounded at Fort
! Donelson and died shortly alter. Mrs.
Morton went on the field as nurse, serving
at White House Landing, Point of Rocks,
j and then at other places until wounded at
i Cold Harbor. It was a bullet in one limb,
; but she recovered so that she could resume
operations as nurse, making her headquar

j troops in the field she was followed and
assisted in all her work of mercy by four
colored servants, who in earlier days had
been her slaves in Tennessee. Tnese col
ored men heartily seconded her efforts in
the field and remained with her until the
close of the war. She came West, married
a man named Butler, and lived at Benicla
until her husband died several years ago.
She was g.ven a pension of $12 a month

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JULY 2, 1896.
LIVERMORE HIGH
SCHOOL GRADUATES,
Class of '96 Receives Diplo
mas From President
Teeter.
A YEAR'S GOOD WORK.
First Union High School Organ
ised Under the New
Law.
BUILDING FULLY IQUIPPED.
The Class Is Composed of Three Young
Ladies and Three Young
Gentlemen.
Oakland Office Ban Fkancibco Call,)
908 Broadway, July L |
Three bright young ladies and an equal
number of young men form the tirat
graduating class from the new Livermore
Union High School.
Great interest was shown in the exer
cises, and the building was crowded.
Principal W. J. Connell in a little speech
expressed his gratification at the progress
made during the year, and the graduates
were enthusiastically received.
The class of '96 consists of: Laura Brad
shaw, Lena Lotz, Minoie Rathbone, Otto
Rathke, John Aylward and John C. Cal
laghan.
The Union High School of Livermore
was the first of its kind in the State, and,
following its example, many other union
high school* were organized. The Union
High School District No. 1 embraces
Highland, Green, Vista, Mocho, Inman,
Townsend, May, Harris and Livermorei
districts, and each district is represented
in the board by one trustee.
The school was conducted in one of the
rooms of the Livermore Public School
building, but the demand for ttie higher
education increased so fast that a separate
building soon became a necessity. The
contract was let in December, 1892, and
the school was ready for use in August,
1893. The class that nas just graduated is
the first class that has pas.-cd entirely
through the new school.
The High School has been ereatly im
proved during the past year, and is as
completely equipped as any in the State
with chemical and physical apparatus,
and its scholastic work is at present fully
up to the standard set by the Stale Uni
versity. The idea of organizing Union
High schools is essentially a Livermore
idea. The law establishing such itchoola
was first proposed by some of its citizens,
and after its enactment they xvere the first
to take advantage of its provisions.
The Union High School is one of the best
educational institutions in the State. The
faculty consists of VV. J. Connell, princi
pal; Miss Adriana Moore, vice-principal;
Miss Helen Tbayer, assistant principal,
and Miss Cora Â£. Hogg, teacher ninth
grade. Since the ruling of the county
board that the eighth grade completed
the grammar course in this county, the
ninth grade has been transferred to the
High School. i
SHERMAN'S ULTIMATUM.
Whlttemore Having Keen Invited to
Bead the Proclamation at Monterey
Will Be Allowed to Do So.
OAKLAND, Cal., July I.â The pub
lished statements regarding J. Bayard
Whittemore Jr. of San Francisco, the
great-grandson of Commodore Sloat, has
brought Mayor Sherman out with a ring
ing declaration that leaves no doubt as to
where he stands regarding the matter and
what he thinks of the manner in which it
has been bandied. He says:
Sib: An article which appears in The Call
of thU date concerning the Sloat family casts
reflection upon my actions as the chairman of
the committee on arrangements of the Asso
ciated Veterans of the Mexican War for the
celebration at Monterey in not selecting a
young gentleman claiming to be the great
grandson of Commodore Sloat to be placed on
the programme. Ido tr >" n 'end to i>e drawn
into any controversy concerning this matter,
and the least said the )â¢ i
John Drake Sloat Jr., the crandson of Com
modore Stoat, residing at 2822 Franklin ave
nue, St. Louis, Mo., was invited to read the
proclamation of his Rrandfather at the coming
celebration at Monterey on July 7. This invita
tion he wm compelled to decline, and earnestly
requested that his cousin, Lieutenant James
Bayard Whittemore of San Francisco, the Com
modore's oldest grandson, be invited to read it,
as, he did at that place ten years ago, and he has
been invited and has accepted the invitation
to perform that duty and will do so. Inm dis
posed always to do justice to everybody and
to all parties, and a discriminating" public, if
in possession of the knowledge given to me,
could not but approve my action in keeping
our celebration entirely free from matters
which have no business to be intruded upon
it. It is National history to be portrayed and
commented upon, and not a court to decide
upon matters totally foreign to it. Lieutenant
James B. Wnittemore is beyond a doubt the
Oldest grandson of Commodore Sloat, and for
that reason, being the nearest male relative,
has been selected to read the proclamation. I
trust that tor the benefit of the public and all
parties concerned silence will prevail, at least
until after the celebration is over. lam not
in the laundry business. I am, respectfully
yours, Enw in a. Sherman,

Oakland Improvement Ciub has secured
the money necessary to pay the expense
of fillin â¢ the marsh at the head of Pine

to have the work under way within a week
or ten days. At their meeting last night,
H. C. Cavellier, who has just returned
from New Orleans with General Manager
Kruttschnitt of the Southern Pacific Com

of that section of the city. Messrs. Dur

and said they would be pleased to co-oper

Cohen May Be Released.
OAKLAND, Cal., July I.â There is some
doubt as to whether Meyer Cohen, the
newspaper man heid at Salem, Or., will be
brought back to answer to the charge of
forgery made by Pawnbroker Green berg of
San Jose. The latter has so far refused to
put up the funds necessary, and Cohen's
family say he will never prosecute the
charge or they will press the prospective
father-in-law on a charge of opening
Cohen's mail. Unless something is done
at once instructions will be wired to re
lease Cohen.

TRUSTEES ARE JUSTIFIED
Judge Frick Approves the City's
Action in Enlarging Its
Light Works.
The Report of the Library Trustees
Shows a Phenomenal Increase
of Readers.
ALAMEDA, Cal., July I.â The injunc"
tion case of Fleming against the City
Trustees was resumed this morning. Ail
the City Trustees and city officials were
present as well as School Director Lank
tree, Brainard C. Brown, secretary of the
Municipal League, I. P. Allen of the
Library Trustees and T. G. Daniells.
After Trustees Forderer, Fietter and
Clark had been examined on behalf of the
city Judge Frick said he wanted to hear no
further evidence. In his opinion the City
Trustees were justified in incurring the
expenditures for the power at the electric
light works. AH he wished now was to
have the arguments of counsel on the
point of the city having power to sell light
to the citizens. Five days' time was
granted counsel to file their briefs on the
question.
Library Trustees' Report.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Jnly I.â The Board of
I Library Trustees has filed its annual
1 report with tue City Clerk, together with
| the report of the librarian, as provided for
! under section XI of the act of 1880.
The receipts for the year are given as
! $10,298 38 and the disbursements $7359 19,
â  leaving a balance of $2939 19.
Particular stress is laid on the pbenom
; enal increase in the circulation of books
j for home use, "which haÂ« rapidly and
i steadily increased from 51,132 volumes for
| 1892-93 to 115.126 volumes for the year just
' ended. Few libraries of double our num
ber of volumes can show such figures."
Further on the trustees with pardonable
pride claim "that our expenditure on
salaries and working expenses Is remark
ably less than that of any other library of
similar size or circulation in the United
States."
According to the report extensive pur
chases have been made for the reference
department, and the library has been
made a part of tiie public sctiooi system
by affording every facility for furthering
the work laid out in the new course of
study.
The librarian's report shows that there
are 20,416 volumes on the shelves, of which
14,726 are in general circulation. The
daily issue of books averages 378 volumes,
and only twenty-one are said to be miss
ing. The number oi books circulated
during the year reaches 115,126, and
the average cost to circulate them is
2.1 mills per volume. Before free access
to the shelves was given, with half the
circulation, the cost was over 4 mills per
volume. Readers have bad free access to
the book shelves during the past three
years.

FRANK HADSELL'S
RED WAGON HOUSE,
Socialism to Be Spread by
a Party of Able
Lecturers.
WILL TOUR THE STATE.
Addresses to Be Made From the
Steps ot the Queer
Vehicle.
READING MATTER GIVEN AWAY
Towns All Along the Coast Will Be
Visited This Summerâ A Suc
cess in the East.
The socialists of this City have accepted
a proposition whereby they will be able to
spread socialistic doctrines and literature
all over the State. The means is new on
this -ide of the Rocky Mountains, but it
has worked successfully in the East. The
| plan is to send out a wagon with literature
j and speakers, who stop wherever night
j overtakes them and discuss matters of
I political economy with any and all who
i are interested in the subject in any of its
j various branches.
Next week Frank Hadsell and two other
socialists will leave this City for the
northern counties on such a mission. The
| vehicle they will travel in is different in
many respects from any ever sÂ»en here
before. The idea originated with Mr..
Hadsell, who is an earnest member of the
Socialist Labor party. He stated yester
day that for years he had not been in good
health and he determined to live out of
doors as much as possible.
A year ago he began to put his plan
into operation. He built a wagon that
will answer his purposes. Mounted upon
a heavy running-gear is a little house ten
feet eight inches in length by six feet wide
and six feet high. In the sides are six
windows for light and air. The interior is
neatly and compactly fitted up. It con
tains two cupboards and several little
cubbyholes for storing away necessary ar
ticles. The bed is a woven wire mattress
in an iron frame, which in the day time is
hoisted and fastened to the ceiling, and at
night it is let down and rests on tne boxes
over the wheels.
In the front end is the cook stove, of the
camp order, and under the driver's seat
all the necessary provisions will be car
| ried. A tin box, the width of the wagon.
| is placed under the footrest, and this will
. serve as a wardrobe for the traveler's extra
I clothing. The entire wagon is painted
! red. In the East ths socialists' red nag is
displayed from the top of this class of
vehicles, but no flag will be carried on Mr.
Hadsell's bouse on wheels. Mr. Hadsell
will be provided with shotguns and fish
ing tackle to provide hiriself with amuse
ment and his larder with food. A pair of
stout horses will be attac hed to the rie.
Mr. Hadsell stated that it is strictly a
private venture, but that he gave the so
j cialists an opportunity to carry on their
i propaganda work throughout the State.
i Who his companions will be is not yet
I stated. They will start first into Sonoma
j County, thence to Mendocino, Lake, Yolo
| and other counties still further to the
I north. Wherever they can sectvo audi
ences, either in towns or in thickly in
nabited districts, they will deliver ad-
I dresses. If halls can be obtained cheap,
!so much the better. If not, the speakers
I will deliver their addresses from the steps
of the strauge red wagon.
The local branches and the San Fran-
I Cisco section will furnish the party with
i plenty of literature for sale and free dis
| tribution to all interested. This is right
I In the line of the local socialists' efforts.
I The State executive committee recently
! decided to send the State organizer into
! the interior to form branches wherever
possib'e. It has been suggested that State
Organizer E. T. Kingsley will form one of
the trio, but if he does not, he will no |

State Teaching 'iheir Doctrines.
doubt, a little later, visit many of the
towns along the route taken by the wagon
party.
After touring the northern part of the
State Mr. Hadsell and bis companions
will turn their horses' heads toward the
citrus belt, where the same line of work
will be carried on.
As stated, in the East these wagon par
ties have accomplished much in t!>e way
of making converts to socialistic doc- !
trines. Tiiere are many places where the j
inhabitants are ripe for a change in mat
ters political, but beinÂ« distant from the
great centers of civilization where social
ism has its stronghold* they are not
familiar with the principles of the doc- i
trines. in many instances they rate i
socialism and anarchy in the same class, j
In such districts the Eastern lecturers â 
find the ground ripe for the seed, and the j
success of their teachings is plainly mani- I
lest by the increase in the Presidential I
vote for the socialists' candidate. The so- {
cialists of Chicago, St. Louis, New York
and several other large cities have these
lecturers out in the country all of the time
and pay all of their expenses. In several j
instances the wagons have never returned
to the places from which they started.
It may be so in this instance, for Mr.
Hadsell has no idea when he will return,
and it may be that he will never come
back.

SOME MIXED TROTTING.
The Talent Stayed With Athena,
but Humboldt Maid Had
More Speed.
LADIES WERE OUT IN PROFUSION
Solo, Clay S and Addison All Demon
strated Their Ability to Win
Oats and Purses.
A beautiful day for racing purposes and
a free gate for the ladies drew a much
larger crowd to witness tne trotting events
at Ingleside than was present on the day
preceding. The card was one that the
veterans found hard to enthuse over and
Auctioneer Al Leach nearly threw a splint
in an endeavor to brace the betting up,
which had a tendency toward sJuggisb
ness. However, his persuasive tongue
was not without its effect, and before the
day was over the weather-worn wallets
from "up country" were unstrapped and
the wagering brightened up somewhat.
Tie decision of the judges in the case of
Driver Albertson, who was suspended for
alleged crooked handling of the horse
Strathmont on Tuesday, will undoubtedly
stand, as Secretary F. W. Kelley stated
yesterday that Judge Cohen had settled
the entrance money due the National
Trotting As sociation with the local Â»sso
ciation on Saturday last. It is said the
ruling will shortly have a rehearing at a
special meeting.
Nothing of a sensational character
marked the day's sport. Starter McNair
was in his usual good form and sent the
fields, which were, small, in almost perfect
alignment. .: . 'f
. The opening event, the 2:35 trot for a
$460 purse, was trotted under the new
regime, making every heat a race. Five
came out for the word, with Clay 8 hold
ing sway in the pooling at $11, Addison
bringing $10, and the field, consisting of
Eliert, Solo and Sonatine, going for $8.
Ellert drew the pole and showed, promi
nently in the lead to the half. Clay S and
Addison both went in toe air turning
down the backstretch, the former almost j
stopping to a walk. Nelson quickly picked
Addison up and overhauling Ellert at the j
far turn sent him to a break. Addison i
then took the heat cleverly in 2:27%, with
Eliert barely heading Solo out for second
money.
For the second chunk to be sliced out of
the purse Ad'tison on his good showing 'â 
was now in brisk demand, bringing $10 â 
against $7 for Clay S and $6 for the held.
The favorite broke at the first turn and
Sanders behind Solo gained the rail posi
tion. The mare held the lead until after
passing the half pole, when Clay S over- I
took her, and, going to the front, cap- i
lured the heat in a jog, with Solo second, j
a couple of lengths before Adaison. Time, <
2:25}*. . .â 
For the remaining heat Clay S again !
held sway, fetching $10, Addison $6 and
the field $4. The tirst choice was un
steady, leaving his feet at the first turn
and again at the halt. Addison turned
into the homestretch a length ahead of
Ellert, with Solo a close third. Below the
furlong pole Ellert bioke, and finishing
gamely, Solo gradually drew up on Addi
son, and in an exciting finish beat him
out half a length in 2:25%.
The 2:24 trot for a purse of $1000 was
second on the card and brought out a
field of six starters. Athena, the Palo
Alto stock farm entry, with a two-year-old !
record of 2:2b\i, a half-sister to Aria |
(2:16%), the sensational two-year-old of
1894, was made favorite, and after flatter
ing her backers by taking the tirs't heat
from Hum bold t Maid very cleverly 'in 2:18
was beaten in the following three. Tiie
Maid made a disastrous break just before
turning into the stretch or the result
might have been different in the opening !
heat. The betting, which had been Athena I
$10, the field $1, was now Athena $10 and
the field going begeing at $4. The game
iittle Humboldt Maid was steady as clock
work when next she came out, and placed
three straight heats to her credit in 2:17,
2:23,2:20. Driver HogODoom was accord
ed an ovation, which he acknowledged by
doffing his velvet cap. Athena was second
in each of the deciding heats, with the ex
ception of the third, when she was beaten
out for the place by Galette.

NOTES,
Addison headed Solo out in the third
heat of the opening event, but was placed
second for running un^.er the wire.
Los Angeles, driven by Walter Maben,
was accorded no little backing to win the
2:24 trot, but broke repeatedly in the
different heats, proving a disappointment
all around.
After Humboldt Maid had taken the
second heat of her race, the betting
switched and she sold even up against the
field. Before the deciding heat the bet
ting was stagnant, the Maid bringing $20
against $7 for all the others.

ARRESTED FOR
THREATS TO KILL,
Dr. Arthur Martin Ac
cused by Miss Alma
Josslyn.
SAYS SHE IS HIS WIFE.
The Physician Declares That
His Plight Is Caused by
Designing Enemies.
VALUABLE PAPERS INVOLVED.
A Curious Case, Comprising Heirs to
a Large Estate and Parties Ito a
Breach of Promise Suit
In the arrest of Dr. Arthur Martin last
evening a curious condition of affairs in
volving the physician and some of the
Josslyn heirs has been brought to light.
Dr. Martin was arrested by Officer Mc-
Murray of the Society for the Suppression
of Vice, the charge being threats to kill.
The bonds were fixed at $2000.
Although the complaint was sworn to
yesterday afternoon before Judge Campbell
by Mrs. E. A. Basford, the complaining
witness on tbe register of the City Prison
is Alma Josslyn.
Dr. Martin was seen in the prison, but
he was somewhat reserved in giving any
information. He talked enigmatically,
but after considerable trouble he came
down to the question of his arrest.
"My arrest," he said, "nas been insti
gated b> r Davis Louderback, the attorney.
It would take too long to explain the
reason why. Alma Josslyn is one of tbe
Josslyn heirs, and I have befriended her
during all the legal battles in the courts.
Louderback has been acting for the
opposing side, and my arrest is
simply a ruse to force me to
explain my exact relationship to Alma
Josslyn for purposes best known to him
self and to endeavor to get the custody of
important papers wh.ich are in my posses
sion and which would throw considerable
light upon the reaL object of my arrest.
"Miss Josslyn, I know, is no party to my
arrest. She is sick and unable to leave her
bed, and could not have sworn to the war
rant. Why, if she were able to come here,
she would throw her arms around my
neck and kiss me, just as v wife would be
naturally supposed to conduct herself if
her husband were in the position I now
am. I feel sure she does not know of my
arrest and will be very indignant and
troubled when she hears of it.
"The charge that I threatened to kill her
is false. Is she my wife? Well, this is
neither the proper time nor place for me
to say whether she is or not."
Inquiry at 1322 Mission street elicited
the information tbat no such person as
Alma Josslyu was known there. It seems,
however, from information furnished by
Dr. Martin at a late hour last night that
she bad entered the place above named as
Mrs. Earnest.
"I had not intended to speak about it,"
said Dr. Martin, "but it seems that her,
or rather our, enemies have been at work
to bring about our downfall, so 1 see no
particular reason why tbe true facts
should not be known.
"I am the husband of Alma Josslyn.
We were married three years ago and have
two children at;ed 18 and 3 months. Dr.
Logan attended my wife during her last
illness and he knows the affectionate re
lations existing between us>. I have not
seen her for over a week, but I am sure if
sbe knew I was iv prison it would kill her.
That, I suppose, is just what her enemies
are working for. Ido not care to give all
the facts of the case at present, but at the
proper time I will tell the public some
thing which will interest them."
Later last night Attorney Davis Louder
back said that he knew nothing about the
arrest It was news to him. He stated
that the onl y relation he had in any cir
cumstance in which Miss Josslyn was in
terested was as attorney for George Staacke
in the case in which she sues him for $50,
-000 damages for breach of promise. That
suit is still hanging tire because Miss
Josslyn is not 21 years of age, and it will
be opened up again.
Judge Louderback received visitors
cheerfully last night, but to all he had
nothing to say, except that he had noth
ing to do with the case.
Mjss Josslyn is a handsome young
woman, who, having passed the tutorship
of courts, is now branching out into inde
pendent suits on her own account.
She first sued Dr. George Staacke for be
trayal, and now she appears with a suit
for threats to kill against Dr. Martin, who
had been her guardian and her pillar of
support in the Staacke suits.
BOOMING THE CARNIVAL
Public Bodies Give Assurance of Their

The committee, consisting of F. A.

the executive committee of tbe Carnival
of the Golden Gate, succeeded yesterday
afternoon in enlisting the hearty support
and co-operation of the Merchants' Asso

man of the Merchants' Association, Hugh
Craig of the Chamber of Commerce and A.
A. Watkins of the Board of Trade, each of
whom said he appreciated tne advantages
that San Francisco would derive from the
carnival and promised to bring the matter
before his body, with a view of making
the proposed mass-meeting a grand suc
cess.
kater in the afternoon the committee
called upon President Warfield, who sent
the following letter to the presidents of
the three organizations:
Dear Sir: The committee appointed to wait
upon you with reference to the approach Ing
carnival, consisting of Messrs. F. A. Haber,
1. L. Rosen thai and Colonel George Stone,
have reported this afternoon the hearty wel
come and cordial reception which was ac
corded them by yourself, v the representative
of your association, and oh behalf of the mem
bers of the executive committee I desire to
personally extend ibeir thnnks 10 you for the
manner in which you received them and for
the earnost interest you take la the mutter
which I believe is of such vital interest not
only to our City, but our State.
In view of the lact that tne presidents of
those organizations have agreed upon the date
I woula suggest that the meetiug of the com
bined associations be held at the Chamber of
Commerce, on Thursday, July 9, at 2 :30 p. M.
Gustav Walters, manager of the
Orpheum, has placed his house for one
evening at the disposal of the committee
when he will present the gross receipts as
his contribution to the carnival. The
management of the Chutes on Haight
street will, as soon as their contemplated
improvements are completed, do the same.
There has been a general response from
the leading dry-goods houses and others,
who have been notified to make a display
of the colors of the carnival, blue, gold
and cardinal, commencing Saturday morn
ing, July 11.

MIDWEEK THEATER ROTES
Miss Shannon Shines as a
Modern Becky Sharpe in
"Sweet Violets,"
The Vitascope Wi 1 Soon Laave the
Orpheumâ The Tivoh's Coming
Grand Operas.
Large houses at the California Theater
are tne deserved reward of the Stock
well Company's clever presentation of "A
Bunch of Violets" this week. The play is
above the average, especially in one or two
powerful scenes, which are strong without
encroaching on the domain of the melo
dramatic.
Ab Mrs. Murgatroyd Miss Effie Shannon
especially shines. The role is that of an
adventuress, a sort of Becky Sharpe char
acter, and in the scenes where Mrs. Murga
troyd deals round honeyed words that
stab, in spite of their apparent sweetness,
Miss Shannon's purring manner and guile
less Ingenuousness are simply fascinating.
Stockwell is thoroughly effective as
Mark Murgatroyd, the rough, shrewd old
Yurkshireman, and the rest of the cast is
good.
"Americans Abroad" will be produced
at the California on Monday.
"His Wife's Father" continues to arouse
laughter and applause at the Columbia
Theater. The play is new here, so that
odious comparisons cannot be made be
tween the present performance and others
that have preceded it. To tell the truth,
however, "His Wife's Father" is one of
tbe best things that the Frawley Com
pany has done during its present 'engage
ment and well deserves the large houses
tbat it is attracting.
Tbe drama at the Grand this week, "One
of the Bravest," has the full amount of
stirring incidents and scenic features.
Emmet Sheridan is proving a good star
attraction, and thanks to Gilbert and Gol
die's efforts the comedy element is well
looked after.
The last days of the vitascope are adver
tised at the Orpheum, and as the Edison
invention nas steadily grown in popu
larity numbers of people are going to see
the last of the May lrwin kiss and the
Cissy Fitzgerald wink. The rest of the
bill, however, is well worthy of attention,
particularly the Fredericks troupe and
the M iagets, who have gained popularity
owing to the recent boom given to prize
fighting.
"A Trip to the Moon," will run for the rest
of tbe week at the Tivoli. There has been
a large sale of seats for the grand or)era
season which opens on Monday. "Lucia"
will be the first performance and on
Wednesday Gounod's ''Romeo and Juliet"
will be produced for the first time in this
City.
Large audiences are still the order of the
day, or rather of the night, at the Park
Theater where "The Rambler from Clare"
is being produced by a clever company,
which includes some good specialty artists.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JULY 2, jB9:.
TO COLLECT
BIG WAR DEBT.
Bank President K. Sonoda's
Distinguished Mis
sion.
CHINA NOW PAYING UP.
America's Greatly Improved
Commercial Relations With
Japan.
MORE BATTLE-SHIPS NEEDED.
A Facific Line of Steamships May
Soon Be Establishedâ lmproving
Commerce.
The payment of the war indemnity by
China to Japan, the commercial relations
between the United States and Japan, etc.,
were the topics very intelligently and
pleasantly discussed yesterday by Kokichi
Sonoda, the president of the Yokohama
j Specie Bank. He is now making a tour
I of the several agencies of the bank in
America, Europe and Asia. Within a
week or ten days he will leave this City
! for New York and go thence to London,
where he will make the requisite arrange
ments for the receipt of the next install
ment of the big war debt, which China is
resignedly liquidating and Japan is cheer
fully receiving.
"The total indemnity," said Mr. So-
noda,*' "is 200,000,000 taels, or about Â£30,
-000.000 sterling. Of this sum, two install
ments, amounting to 100,000,000 taels, have
already been received by Japan. All of
this money has to be handled by our
bank, which shows that we possess tbe
confidence of the Bank of Japan, for
which corporation we act as agent. For
surrendering possession of the peninsula
of Liau-Tong our Government also gets
: 30,000,000 taels, and China pays us 500.000
taels yearly while troops are stationed
at Wai Hai Wai. When money is re
ceived in payment of the indemnity it is
at first deposited in the Bank of England
and used subsequently as may be required.
"The ports of China are easier of access
since the close of the late war. Various
manufacturing industries are now rapidly
springine up in that country and foreign
capital will be required for their develop
ment. Already there are a half dozen cot
ton factories in Shanghai, and the result
will be a brisk commercial competition
between China and Japan. The more we
produce and the more we sell the more
we must buy, and our importations of cot
ton from your country will naturally in
crease. Trade in Japan has received a
great stimulus and the United Statea is
sure to get its ghare, but we wish to go as
steadily as possible and not too fast, for
fear we may fall down.
"I am satisfied that a new steamship
line will be established before long be
tween Japan and the United States. To im
prove the commerce between these coun
tries freight rates must be reduced, insur
ance cheapened ana better banking facili
ties provided. We, as bankers, are doing
the best we can to extend our trade with
your Nation. At all times our relations
with America have been of the most
friendly nature, but with England we feel
that circumstances might make of her
either a friend or a foe. There is no
weather-cock to tell us in which direction
! the wind is blowing.
"It is very probable that Japan may
give the Union Iron Works of your City a
battle-ship contract. It is mainly a con
sideration of business as to whether our
ships will be built in the United States or
England. The shorter distance from
Japan is in favor of your country, and
then in the event of war in Europe it
would also be preferable for us to get our
ships from you.
"The Yokohama Specie Bank was in
corporated under a special charter sixteen
years ago. Its chief aim is to give all pos
sible facilities to our foreign trade and
commerce. It is the only corporation of
its class now in existence in Japan.
"We do a very heavy exchange business
and have agancies in New York, London.
San Francisco, Honolulu, Lyons, Bombay
and Shanghai. We also have correspon
dents in the principal commercial cities of
America, Europe and Asia. A new agency
wiil soon be established in Hongkong.
In March last our capital was increased
from 6,000,000 to 12,000.000 yen and this
year our reserve fund will exceed 5,000,000
yen.
Mr. Sonoda has an excellent English
education. He haa been in the diploma
tic service, and from 1882 to 1889 was the
ci nsul of Japan at London. >, During his
long residence in London he made a
special study of the industries .- of the
country and the methods :of L finance,
and banking, as exemplified by the Bank
of England.. ; -
In 1890 he accepted * the .presidency of
the Yokohama Specie Bank and conducted
it _ successfully through â¢ a -troublesome
crisis arising out of the currency actions
taken by the United States and India. Mr.
Sonoda was decorated with the fourth
class order of the Rising Sun and also re
warded with a grant of money for the ser
vices of his bank to the Government dur
ing the late war. ~&MÃ&Bt&gMggÃgÃ
He is accompanid by ' his private secre
tary, K. J. linanisbi, who was a resident
of this City eipht or ten years ago. He
has traveled : extensively since then and
speaks and writes English with as much
fluency and idiomatic accuracy as a native
American.
BALDWIN IN TROUBLE.
The United States Marshal Suddenly
Finds Himself Without Any
Deputies.
United States Marshal Barry Baldwin
was practically forced to suspend opera
tions yesterday. There were five or six
duly appointed deputies hanging around,
but the misfortune consisted in their not
being properly sworn in.
What is generally known a? the fee bill
went into effect yesterday. It became
necessary for Baldwin to name new depu
ties or reappoint his old ones prior to the
new fiscal year. As the men under him
had seen years of service he wisely con
cluded to name them for the positions.
As Judge Morrow was absent it was im
possible to legally install them in office,
and in consequence business was at a
standstill. Judge Morrow is expected to
return to-day, when the deputies will be
formally sworn in.
RATTLING THE OLD BONES
Winnifred Barron's Change From
Plaintiff to De
fendant.
She Grasps at a Fortune But Cannot
Pay an Insignificant I
Rent.
Winnifred Barron, or Winnifred Mor
ton, and her son, Edward Andrew Barron,
are being sued for the rent of a little room
on Harrison street by G. W. Fink. The
rent due is $48, the accumulation of an $8
rent since January, and, although the de
fendants claim relationship to Edward
Barron, the millionaire, they cannot pay
that small sum.
Winnifred Barron is the colored woman
who claims to have once been tbe mistress
of Edward Barron, and Edward Andrew
Barron, she says, is their son. She has
appeared in the Justices' Courts before,
three times before, when she commenced
as many different suits against Barion for
the maintenance of the boy. On each oc
casion she made a desperate effort to se
cure a judgment for $275 a month, but she
failed, and now, while clutching at the
millions, she cannot pay a rent of $8 a
month.
The first suit was commenced in 1882,
but it was not carried very far, for, as in
a later complaint, a consideration from
Barron. She says that B. 3, Newman was
then her attorney, but she was promised
a house in Louisville, Ky., if she would
dismiss Newman and hire two other at
torneys named This she agreed
to do. and Â±\ J. Sullivan, Barron's man
ager, turned over to her a cottage worth
$3250. Soon after that her attorneys dis
missed the suit.
In 1890 anotber suit was brought, but
upon promise of payment it was dismissed.
As the payment did not follow a third
suit was started. In this complaint it was
alleged that Edward Andrew Barron was
THE LATE W. CULLEN.
the son of Edward Barron and that be was
in need of the common necessaries of life.
Ho was then about 9 years old. It was
alleged that Edward Barron had paid $35
a month for the support of the boy, but
that was not sufficient, and beside* the
money was not paid regularly. The only
income she and her son had, the plaintiff
alleged, was $25 a month, which she pot as
rent from the cottage in Louisville. She
thought $275 more would about support
the boy and so she sued for it.
An answer was filed denying all the alle
gations, and then in a few days this suit,
too. was dismissed without prejudice.
Then Barron tiled an affidavit demanding
that the case be put again upon the cal
endar for trial.
He denied that the plaintiffs were re
lated to him in any way. and that he had
ever paid $35 a month or any other sum
for the maintenance of the child. He said
the suit was brought for the purpose of ex
torting money from him, and he wanted
the charges brought into court. But the
case was never taken up again.
The suits were suppresssd in some way,
but yesterday's filings have recalled them
and the peculiar story they told. The
complaints in the old suits are indorsed
with this brief caption: "Complaint for
maintenance and support by a poor son
against a ricn father.'*
Struck a Woman.
Mrs. Amelia Wuest, 524 Alabama street,
swore to a complaint yesterday charging Otto
Grainest, proprietor o( a restaurant at 26

PROPERTY CLERK
W. CULLEN DEAD,
Expired Yesterday After
noon After a Brief
Illness.
SKETCH OF HIS LIFE.
He Was One of the First Set
tlers in Washington
Territory.
PIONEER PRODUCE MERCHANT
Joined the Force Thirty Years Ago
and Two Years Later Was Made
Property-Clerk.
William Cullen, the veteran property
clerk of the Police Department, died at bis
residence, 59 South Park, about half-past
3 o'clock yesterday afternoon.
He had been in failing health for several
months and about two months ago was
forced to leave his desk. He was able to
go around till two or three weeks ago,
when he took to bis bed and died yes
terday afternoon.
The deceased was born at Barrettstown
Castle, County Wicklow, Ireland, on
February 17, 1822, and was, therefore, in
the 75th year of his age.
He came to San Francisco in 1852, but
only remained a few months. Then he
went up north and was one of the first
settlers in the then Washington Territory.
He was a member of the first Board of
County Commissioners of Whatcom
Connty and at the same time held the
position of Justice of the Peace.
The Hudson Bay Company at that time
had possession of Sin Juan Island, which
was claimed as part of the United States.
By consent of Governor Stevens Mr. Cul
len levied an attachment for taxes upon
sheep belonging to the company, and with
the aid of tbe sheriff and several of his
men, successfully carried off thirty-nine
rams.
This action of Mr. Cullen led to the
United States obtaining possession of that
island and other islands in tbe Straits of
Georgia, a iact which he always took great
pride in referring to.
The deceased left Whatcom County
shortly afterward and was for some years
engaged in mining and farming in this
State. He was the pioneer produce mer
chant in this City, and was engaged in
that business when appointed to the
police force on November 20, 1866. Less
than two years afterward, on September 1.
1868, he was appointed oroperty"clerk. He
held that position for nearly twenty-eight
years ana had the rank ana pay of cap
tain.
The late property clerk was highly
esteemed and respected by members of the
department and all who came in contact
with him. He was lasting in his friend
ships, and many found in him a kind
friend and adviser. The system he inau
gurated in the management of his branch
of the department was incomparable and
was the a (miration of visitors from police
aepartments in other cities. He was care
ful, methodical and correct in every little
detail, and a hard and untiring worker.
His wife died several years ago, but he
leaves a crown-up family to mourn his loss.
It is probable that Sergeant Moran, who
has been connected with the property
clerk's department for several years and is
thoroughly conversant with all the details,
will be appointed to fill the vacancy.
The Police Commissioners met last
night and immediately adjourned out of
respect to the memory of the deceased.
NO COIN IN SIGHT.
The June Salary of Federal Employes
Is Probably Postponed Until
December Next.
Consternation reigns among the Custom
house officials. The salary warrants for
June should have reached here some six
or seven days ago. Up to the present time,
however, not one word has been received
from the department at Washington, and
in consequence there is no little uneasi
ness. Tbe men, of course, understand that
they will ultimately receive their salary,
but snch knowledge does not pay the bills
of to-day.
"This thing has happened beforeâ once
or twice, I think," said Special Deputy
Jerome yesterday, "and there is certainly
no occasion for alarm. If the appropri
ation has run short, then it simply means
that the next Congress will pass a de
ficiency bill. I cannot believe, however,
that the fund is exhausted. If it was we
would have received some notice, either
by telegram or letter. "
In spite of Mr. Jerome's confident as
sertion that the requisition would be forth
coming in a day or so, the impression pre
vails in customs circles that June salaries
will not be paid until December, or when
the next general deficiency bill is passed.
Years ago, in Japan, there was a coin
called the monseng, which was worth
only about 1-224 of a penny. It was an
iron piece.
