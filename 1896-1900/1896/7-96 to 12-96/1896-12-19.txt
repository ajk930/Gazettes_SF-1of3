VOLUME LXXXI.-NO. 19.
MAY RECOGNIZE
THE PATRIOTS
Freedom of the Cubans to
Be Recommended to
the Senate.
Belligerency of the Insurgents
Kecogniz?d by the Foreign
Relations Committee.
But the Measure Will Be Opposed in
the House and Vetoed by
Cleveland if Passed.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 18.â The
Cuban situation took an unexpected turn
t-.his morning when the Senate Committee
on Foreign Relations decided without any
â¢erious opposition to report Senator Cam
eron's joint resolution recognizing the in
dependence of the republic of Cuba.
This report will be made to the Senate
Monday, but there is no prospect of deci
sive action in either house of Congress
before the holidays. Meanwhile the situ
ation in Cuba, as it develops during the
holidays, will undoubtedly affect the
formal action of Congress on the resolu
tions. Only two adverse suggestions were
made in the committee on the Camerou
resolution. Both of these counseled de
lay until after the holidays. These sug
gestions came, it is understood, from Sen
ators Hale and Sherman.
The action of the Foreign Relations
Committee created great surprise. Tbe
House was in sessson and the Cuban sym
pathizers crowded to the front. The par
liamentary programme for the Cameron
resolution is to pass the Senate and the
Houseâ not until after the holidays, how
ever â and then go the President, where it
is thoucht a veto awaits it. In the Com
mittee on Foreign Relations the senti
ment was quite general that the President
would veto the resolution.
It is believed the Senate and House will
both pass it, if the Cuban discussion could
receive a setback during the holidays.
But it is expected that a long debate will
be held on the resolution in both House
and Senate, and tbe date when the reso
lution will reach the President for his
action is several weefcs ahead.
An amendment was made in tbe text of
the resolution, and as finally agreed to it
reads as follows:
Retolved, That the independence of the
Republic of Cuba be and the same is hereby
acknowledged by the United States of America.
Section 2. That the United States -nill use
its friendly offices with tins Government of
Spain to bring to a close the war oetween
Spain and Cuba.
Secretary Olney, who had been re
.cd to appear before the committee
sby Senator Sherman, was present for one
hour, and laid before the committee all of
ihe information in tbe possession of the
State Department. He stated to the com-
mittee very fully the policj' of the Admin-
iMration and the reasons that actuated it
in its present attitnde toward the insur-
rection in Cuba. No member of the com
mittee is willing to make any statement
as to what Mr. Olney said, each one look
ing upon his statement as a confidential
matter between the Secretary and the
committee. Sufficient is known, however,
to show that Mr. Olney laid before the
committee the information received from
Consul-General Lee and other sources that
has been steadfastly kept from the general
public.
Mr. Olney's argument did not appear
to have much weight with the committee,
if it was against the passage of the reso
lution, for immediately upon his with
drawal the resolution was laid before the
committee for action. There was no aye
and no vote, but the resolution was
agreed to without a dissenting voice. The
only point of difference was as to whether
the action of the committee should be
made public to-day or withheld until
Monday.
One Senator thoucht action of any sort
should be postponed until after the holi
days, but the will of the majority pre
vailed and there was practical unanimity
in the vote. Senators Gray and Daniel
were both absent, but it is said that neither
of them is favorable to the action taken
by the committee.
Senator Cameron was instructed to pre
pare the report that will be submitied to
the Senate Monday. As a matter of fact,
the report was written and was Â«Ã¼bmitted
to tlie committee this morning. It is
looked upon as an exceedingly strong
document and eoes into the diplomatic
history of the United States very fully to
show our policy in the matter of recog
nzingnew States. Some few additional
alterations were suggested by other mem
bers of the committee, but the report as
drawn by the Senator is practically com
plete.
OPPOSITION IN THE HOUSE.
RrpretentotireM in ->o Hurry to Go to
War With Spain.
WASHINGTON, D. C. Dec 18.â The
House heard with surprise of the action of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
in recognizing the independence of Cuba,
and if the opinion of the members of the
Foreign Affairs Committee and some of
the leaders in the House is to be taken as
a criterion, the popular branch of the Gov
ernment will not sustain the position
taken by the Senate Committee.
Hitt of Illinois, the chairman of the
HouÂ«e Committee, is out of the cUy and is
not expected to return until after tne holi
day recess. Several other members of the
committee were not in their seats to-day
and nave presumably left town. Of those
who remainâ and of this number a United
Associaied Presses reporter talked with five
-the entire quintet strongly opposed any
action at this time. The Republicans ob
jected to any steps which would, in their
Opinion, bring about a war with Spain on
Jie eroiind that the McKinley administra
tion ought not to be met at the very mo
ment oi coming into power by so serious
an international problem.
A member of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee said that the time for action
had parsed ; that the island was bankrupt;
that American interests in Cuba are de
stroyed; that our commerce with the
The San Francisco Call
island has practically disappeared and
that recognition now would be a mere
sentiment without a practical considera
tion behind it. "If," said he, "we want a
war with Spain for a sentiment we are at
liberty to have it, but not with my con
sent."
Another member of the committee ex
pressed the belief that me United States
had better attend to its own business and
not go dancing through the congress of
nations with a chip on its shoulder spoil
ing for a fight.
A prominent member, a Republican of
the House, pointed out that a promise of
better times was made to the American
people if Mr. McKinley should be elected
to the Presidency. Mr. McKinley, he
added, had been elected and now it was
purposed by the Senate to take a step
which would involve us in complications
with Spain and retard a return to pros
perity for several year?. He expressed
the belief that all the RepubliCiin leaders
as well as the influential Democrats In the
House would eet their laces strongly
against the adoption of any Cuban resolu
tion which might properly be regarded by
Spain as an unfriendly act.
Members of the Foreign Affairs Com
mittee expressed their surprise at the
change of sentiment amons; their col
leagues. The prediction was freely made
that, notwithstanding the unanimity with
which the resolution was reported by tbe
Senate Committee, it was doubtful if the
Senate would adopt it, or at least not
without a very considerable delay. Not a
single member of the House, out of a
score or more of leaders, could be found
who believed that tbe Senate resolution
con Id pass the House.
The opinion was freely expressed that
the Senate, from being a conservative
branch of the Government, has changed
places with the House, and that the latter
is to-day by Jong odds the conservative
branch of Congres?.
The member of tho Foreign Affairs
Committee who did not hesitate to ex
press his views publicly was Quigg, h. New
York Republican. He said: "I don't
think the Senate resolution can pass the
House at this session of Conpress. Ido
not know a member of the House Com
mittee on Foreign Affairs who is in favor
of it, nor do 1 think it possible to obtain
from the House Committee a resolution of
any sort this session. The disposition of
the House Committee is to leave the mat
ter to the incoming administration. Per
sonally, while I entertain the liveliest
sympathy with Cuba, I am opposed to the
conduct of foreign affairs by Congress."
Pearson of North Carolina, another Ke
publican member of the committee, had
no criticism or comment to make on the
action of the Senate comruiitee. The Re
publican party, he said, had promised the
country prosperity, and the question pre
sents itself, "Will war or rumors of war or
apprehensions of war lead to the promised
result?"
Shafroth, the silver merab3r from Colo
rado, expiessed surprise at the action of
the Senate committee. "Before the elec
tion," he said, "when the candidates had
yet to appeal to the people, the Cuban
revolution was a live subject, but now it
will be found that the business interests
of New York must be protected. You will
find that the New York press to-morrow
will denounce the action as threatening
the relations between Spain and the Uni
ted States, and dangerous to the trade be
tween New York and Cuba, Wall street
will not permit the passage of the resolu
tion through the House. It may pass the
Senate, but that will end the matter."
READY FOR EMERGIENCIES.
Hear Admiral Bunce Hold* the Atlantic
Hquadron for Action.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 18.â A Herald
special from Washington says: Under
orders sent Wednesday by Secretary Her
bert, Rear Admiral Bunce came to Wash
ington yesterday ana had a conference
with the officials in regard to the vessels
of his squadron and the future of its move
ments. The fact that H. C. Taylor, presi
dent of the war college, under whose in
struction a clais during iast summer pre
pared a plan of defense from naval attack
for the gull coast, is also in Washington
gave rise to war rumors around the de
partment, none of which could beverifiod.
It it undoubtedly a fact that Admiral
Bunce discussed with the officials the
plans of the department with regard to the
movements of his fleet, but it is stated
positively that this discussion has not
made any change in the department's in
tention of holding the fleet at Hampton
Road.-, when all the vessels are assem
bled there.
The department declines to state what
decision was reached during the course at
the naval war college as to the best plan
for the defense of thccoast, but tie same
is on file at the naval intelligence office
ready to ba used in case of emergency.
None of the officials will permit them
selves to be quoted as to the object of
Admiral Bunce's visit, but they say there
was nothing unusual in his call.
TO AI D THE CUBANS.
Secret Sleeting of the Chicago Local Jte
lief Committee.
CHICAGO, 111.. Dec. 18.â A secret
meeting of the local Cuban relief commit
tee of 100 was held this evening at the
Union L?ague Club house. The at
tendance was small, but those present
made vigorous speeches in favor of Con
gress immediately recognizing the inde
pendence of Cuba over any President's
veto. Senator Cullora was congratu
lated for his recent pro-Cuban spsech in
Congress.
A resolution was adopted urging the
raising of funds for the purchase of sup
plies for the Cuban armies, anu the press
of the country was requested to receive
and forward contributions.
A committee of five was appointed to
take charge of the money-raising work.
Chairman Cragin read a letter he had re
ceived from President Palma of the Cuban
Junta stating: "I am sorry to sny that we
do not see our way clear to send Dhysi
ciana there, but should circumstances
change we shall be glad to avail ourselves
of the services of American trained nurses
and physicians. The best way to help ns
in our struggle aeainst Spain is to furnish
money to purchase war materials to send
to our armies in Cuba,"
The chairman also reported that Presi
dent Palma^bad told him during his last
conversation that they had besides an
urniy of 40,000 men from 6000 to 8000 men
who have no arm?, but vho are fighting
for home, life and family. These men
can live on sugarcane and other products
of the island and stay in the swamps
without detriment to their health, but
Americana were apt to find it necessary to
go to the hospital.- The Cubans cannot

island, death beine the penalty for those
who supply the insurgents with medical
store?.
The money raised ber*Â» will be sent to
New York with the specification that it is
intended for the purchase of hospital sup
plies, because that kind of aid is allowed
by law, but if the Cuban Junta uses the
money for other purposes there will be no
disposition here to investigate or criticize.

Comment of the Daily Xetrs on the Com-
mitte't Action.
LONDON, Eng., Dec. 18.â Commenting
to-morrow on the action of the Foreign
Relations Committee of the American
Senate in agreeing to report favorably
Senator Cameron's resolution recognizing
the independence of Cuba, the Daily NÂ«ws
will say it is oi the opinion that the com
mittee's action will not tend to any imme
diate result. It remarks that the con
dition of Cuba is a serious matter, and is
naturally irritating to the free neighbor
ing Republic. The strength of the sup
porters of the resolution lies in the fact
that Spain is unable to subdue Cuba or let
tbe island alone.

LOS ANGELES, Cal., Dec. 18.â A rous
ing meeting was held in Music Hall to

trance. Captain F. J. Cressy was chair

Colonel Messmer, Mrs. KateTupper Gal
pin, L. C. Young and J. R. Ruih. Strong

new organization of this city, under com
mand of Captain Henry Steere, sent a
letter to Chairman Cressy expressing a
wish that Cuban libre would soon become

BOUND TO BEAT THE REFUNDING BILL.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 18.â The Committee on Koles of the House cf Representatives met this morning, and among
other thin s considered the resolution introduced by Representative Powers of Vermont, chairman of the Committee on Pacific
Railroads, setting aside a time for the consideration of the Pacific roads refunding bill. The Powers resolution set January 5
for calling up the measure, general debate to continue three days, with speeches under the five- minute rule on the fourth day.
The Rules Committee practically azreed to report this resolution a week a.o, as stated exclusively in The Call, but at to-day's
session it was thought best to defer the bill's consideration for two days. Accordingly a resolution was reported to-day to
consider th 2 bill in the House on January 7, 8 and 9, the vote to be taken immediately after the meeting of the House on Monday,
January 11.
Judee Maguire appeared before the committee this morning and protested earnestly and vigorously against consideration
of the Powers bill or any other refunding scheme. He was ably supported In this protest by Representative Ben ton McMillin
of Tennessee, the only member o' the Rules Committee who seems to be opjiosad to Mr. Huntington's measure. McMillin is
regarded as one of tlie ablest debaters in the House, and since tiie death of ex-Speaker. Crisp of Georgia is looked upon as
the leader of the Democratic side. Judge Maguire is very much pleased with the earnestness shown by McMillin and believes
that his aggressive opposition to the refunding bill will very greatly assist the Calitornia delegation in their right against the
bill. During the session of the Committee on Rules this morning Read, who, by virtue of his position as Speaker of the House
it chairman of the Rules Committee, asked Judge Maguire if he would use filibustering methods if the rule reported by the
committee of the consideration of the Powers bill omitted a provision entitling the supporters of the bill to demand the previous,
question at the end of the debate. Judge Maguire replica that he would me every means at his command to prevent * vote
being taken on the bill, and would filibuster to the end of the session if necessary to defeat tlio bill.
Genera! Maceo, the Cuban patriot, is dead,
and as every evidence conclusively points
to his having been murdered under a flag
of truce by Spanish hirelings, now, there
fore, the liberty-loving descendants of our
revolutionary fathers are requested to
meet on Saturday evening next, at the
Lindell Hotei, for the purpose of organ
izing a Cuban club and making plans for
holding a rousing patriotic meeting in the
near future."

Platt did not say anything in his de
fense when charged with the crime of
murder, but rather admitted that the
charge was true. He appeared perfectly
cool. Mr. Hobson, representing the
United States embassy, was present, as
was also an officer from Lexington, Ky.,
who came to England to take the prisoner
back to America, when the order for his

PRETTY ROMANCE
IN REAL LIFE
Love Finds the Way to
Outwit an Objecting
Parent.
Governor Drake's Daughter Be
comes the Bride of George
Wood Sturdivant.
Followed to Colortdo by the Girl's
Father, Who Forgives and Blesses
the Couple.
DENVER. Colo., Dec. 18.â A pretty ro
mance in real life was disclosed in society
circles of this city this afternoon when the
facts concerning a quiet wedding cere
mony recently performed by the pastor of
a promine ntchurch here was for the first
time given publicity. The contracting
parties are none other thnn Miss Mary
Lord Drake, only daughter of lowa's Gov
ernor, General Drake, and George Wood
Sturdivant, a prominent young business
man of Centerville, lowa.
Miss Drake will be remembered as the
young lady who christened the battle-ship
lowa when that magnificent vessel was
launched at Philadelphia late last sum
mer. A ter her social triumphs in New
York and the EiÂ«st following the christen
ing ceremony of the lowa Miss Drake, ac
companied by Miss Carpenter, h,er firm
friend and companion and a cousin of the
groom, came to Colorado, and after spend
ing several weeks at the prominent moun
tain resorts the young iadies concluded
their tour of the mountains with a visit
to Colorado Springs, where at the Antlers
I hey were joined by Mr. Sturdivant, who
came to the State partly on business, but
principally to visit the sweetheart whom
he nad grown up with from childhood.
Inasmuch as there was some opposition
on the part of the bride's father, it was
decided that there was never a more op
portune time for a wedding ceremony.
The three young people came to Denver
and quietly registered at a prominent
hotel on the morning of October 28. On
the afternoon of that day a license was
procured, and Rev. C. M. Col burn of
Trinity Church pronounced the happy
couple man and wife.
On account of the ambitions entertained
by the war veteran and Governor for the
future of his daughter, it was determined
not to acquaint him with the fact of hi 3
daughter's marriage, but to wait until the
return of the party to their native State
and then tell him, trusting to his personal
clemency to forgive the impulsive act of
the two young people. This programme
would have been carried out, but a few
days after the marriage Mrs. Sturdivant
was taken suddenly ill with pneumonia,
from which she has fully recovered after
a short illness.
Governor Drake arrived in town last
week on a pleasure trip, and was told of
the marriage. The Governor at first re
fused to believe it, but the young couple
produced their marriage certificate, and
the grizzled veteran gracefully acknowl
edged that he had been outgeneraled.
General Drake and his son-in-law left
for the East on Tuesday, and were fol
lowed to-day by the bride and her com
panion, Miss Carpenter.
Mr. Sturdivant will shortly engage in
the banking business in Louisville, where
hi? mother resides. Mr. Sturdivant is
about 24, and is not wealthy, but, it is
said, will be backed in his ban King enter
prise by his fatber-in-law.

PRIOE^TVE CENTS.
VENGEANCE OF A
KENTUCKY MOB
Bloodthirsty Men Enter a
Jail and Kill Three
Prisoners.
Arch Proctor and His Father
Hanged to a Tree Just
Outside of Town.
Bill Proctor Defies the Lynchers to
Take Him Alive and Is Shot
Down in His Cell.
RUSSELLVILLE. Ky., Dec. 18. â A
bloodthirsty armed mob of men from Lo
gan County, half of whom came from
Adairville, reached this town after mid
night this morning and killed three
prisoners who were in jail waiting for trial
on charges of murder and conspiracy.
Arch Proctor, who mnrdere I Aaron and
"Doc" Crafton at Adairville, October 4,
was taken from the jail with his father,
"Dink" Proctor," charged with conspiracy
in the Crafton case, and both men were
hanged to the same tree just outside of the
town.
"Bill" Proctor, a half-brother of "DinK,"
and classed as being a real desperado, who
had terrified the Adairville district for a
number of years, was riddled with bullets
in his cell, defying the mob to take him
out alive and cursing them with his last
breath.
The man-hunters were pitiless and were
well oreanized. They refused lo allow
Arch Proctor to see his mother, who was
sleeping in a neighboring hotel, before
being deprived of life. The jailer pleaded
with the mob not to lynch the men and
then made a special plea for "Dink"
Proctor, who had always been a quiet
citizen, the Crafton murder 3 being the
first trouble he had been mixed up in.
But the only answer of the leaders was,
'â¢Dead men tell no tales."
The Adairville mob came into town
about 100 strong and attacked the jaii at
1:30 o'clock. The door of the main en
trance soon gave way before the onslaught
of sledgehammers. The keeper of the
jail was forced, on the peril of his life
being taken also, to deliver the key of the
Proctor cells to the mob's leaders. The
victims had been apprised of the coming
of the lynchers and their intentions, none
of the three being in bed at the time their
cell doors were opened. They faced an
excited, cursing mass of armed men.
Bill Proctor, who was a powerful man,
showed his desperate character when
brought to bay. He swore no one should
take him from his cell alive, and no one
cared to engage him in a test of physical
streneth to get him out alive. One of the
mob cave the signal for the murderer to
he killed where he stood by shooting him.
A charge of buckshot entered the desper
ado's tody tlie next second and he fell.
As he lav on the floor writhing in pain, a
volley of bullets was fired at him. When
he was apparently dead, a man entered
the cell and placing a piatol barrel at
Proctor's head, pulled the trigger to make
sure that the most feared and murderous
man of Logan County was dead.
Then the mob turned toward the cells of
"Dink" Proctor and his son Arch. They
were taken ffom their cells without resist
ance, the jailer's pleas were unheeded, and
the hands of the victims bound. By this
time there wera fully 200 men in the mob,
and no attempt was made to interfere with
their lynch-law plans. The prisoners were
taken to a three-limbed cedar tree on the
Nashville road. The empty limb was in
tended for Bill Proctor, and on the other
two limbs were strung father and son,
without giving either any time for
speeches, coniessions or prayers.
Mrs. Proctor, the wife and mother, who
had come to attend the examining trial
to-day, was sleeping in a hotel unconscious
of the tragedy which was being enacted
close at hand, and by order of the loaders
the procession to the improvised gallows
was not allowed to stop at the hotel to
grant the last pitiful plea of Arch to see
and say good-by to his mother.
The bodies, swinging side by side, were
cut down this morning, and big crowds
same to the jail to see the three bodies
laid out there for the Coroner's inquest.
The mob on its way to Adairville cue all
tbe telegraph wires ieading from that
place in order to prevent notice of their
coming being given.
The law-abiding citizens of Adairville
congratulated each other that "Bill" and
his nephew had been put away, but the
people of the county generally say that
"Dink" was not deserving of death. The
brothers were acquitted of the charge of
killing Aaron Crafton, and Arch was held
for trial in $2000 bonds. Tbe trial of all
three was set for to-day in the other mur
der case. "Bill" killed several men and has
been on trial four times for his life.

Tuirty-seven private pension bills pre
\ iously reported by tbe committee of the
whole were passed and the rest of the
afternoon was occupied in discussing five
war claim bills, one of which, for the re
lief of Thomas B. Reed, a Pennsylvania
soldier, was passed.
The report of the conference was agreed

to continue beyond the present, session.
Lacey (R.) of lowa offered an amend
ment that the lifieen employes should be
selected from States not now represented
on the doorkeeper's roil, and it was
adopted.
Stone (R.) of Pennsylvania stated tnat
the adoption of the amendment would
make it impossible to appoint a single
folder. The resolution was then disagreed
to, 45 to 292. A demand for the regular
order cut off the remainder of the resolu

for the use of free alcohol and manufac
tures, to report to Congress, limiting the
time to ten days after the beginning of
the next session, and it was agreed to.
This being private bill day under the
rules, Bingham (R.)of Pennsylvania, in
charge of the legislative, executive and
judicial appropriation bill, asked unani
mous consent to proceed with its consid
eration, but objection was made by Malion
(R.) of Pennsylvania, chairman of the
committee on war claims. The bills on
the calendar reported from tbe committee
of the whole was disposed of, thirty-seven
being passed.
A bill to pay $5000 to Flora A. Darling,
widow or a Confederate general, for
money alleced to have been taken from
ncr at the time of her arrest on a steamer
at Ne-v Orleans, while traveling on a safe
permit grantad by General Banks, was
laid on tue table despite t c favorable
recommendation of tbe committee.
These being disposed of, the House
went into committee of the whole to con
sider bills for private relief.
The first bill read raised a laugh, being
"for the relief of Thomas B. Reed." Tne
proposed beneficiary, it turned out, was a
semeant in the Fifth Pennsylvania In
fantry and the bill authorized the Court of
Claims to pass upon his claim for pay as
such sergeant, lie having bet-n carried on
the roll as a private. The bill was passed.
A bill for the relief of James Bigler, a
resident of New York, who owned some
property in Virginia, destroyed during
the war, was laid aside to permit an in
vestigation into the question as to whether
or not it was destroyed iv military opera
tions.
Dingley (R.) of Maine suggested that if
this was the case the biil opened up a
dangerous field, one which Congress had
never before enteredâ that of paying for
property destr yed in military operations.
Should that policy be now adopted, he
baid, Congress would have to provide
revenue to the extent of four or five hun
dred millions instead of rifty or seventy
live millions.
Three or four other war-claim bills were
considered, meeting witu the usual objec
tion. Upon a measure to repay $300 sur>
sntute money taken from a Swede who
was drafted whiie not a citizen of the
United States came up, and Dingley
pleaded that the statute of repose should
be allowed to obtain and that these
claims arising thirty years after the war
had closed be settled and stay settled.
Manon(R.)of Pennsylvania replied to
this, vieoroubly protesting against tho
Government pleadint, the statute of lim
itations after years of denied justice to
claimants. In this case Updegraff (R.)
of lowa, of whom tbe claimant is a con
stituent, denounced the action of the Gov
ernment as that of a highway robber, seiz
ing the money like him by its strong arm
and retainiuc it because of its power to do
bo. 3y a vote of 65 io 55 the committee
recommended favorable action on the bill
and it then rose.
The House passed the bill for the relief
of Thomas B. Reed amidst much amuse
ment and some embarrassment of the
Bpeaâer.
"WELL, WE CAN PASS IT."
Speaker Reed Favor* Action on the AÂ«u>
Tariff Bill.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 18.â
Speaker Reed is referred to as" favoring
action on the new tariff bill that the Ways
and Means Committee will prepare and
report about the middle of January. He
was yesterday asked if he expected to see
such a course pursued, and replied :
"Well, we can pass it. It is about time
that the Congress did something to allow
business to go on and take care of itself.
Why should we not pass it?"
The Republicans who adopt the view of
the Sneaker say that if the tariff bill can
be passed by this Congress and sent to the
Senate, the refusal of the Senate to sup
port the action of the House will be useful
as an illustration of the perversity of tue
Silver Republicans. With the votes of
the Silver Republicans the chances of the
bill would be improved and Democrats
who liave been insisting that the revenues
are insufficient might be induced to aid
in its passage. But the Republicans are
unwilling to base any hopes of success
upon the uncertain action of their poli
tical opponents in this Congress or the
next.
Wednesday's debate in the Senate was
a severe blow to the members of the
Home Market Club, who had come here
from Boston unwilling to believe that
there were tbe insuperable obstacles to
the passaee of the Dinglev bill that
Senators Berry and Lodge bad informed
their constituents there were. Strangely
the Manufacturers' Club of Philadelphia
has entertained the idea that it would be
possible to so arrange matters that oppo
sition could be overcome, possibly with
the aid of the Gold Democrats. These gen
tlemen, however, evidently overlooked
the fact that the number of Gold Dem
ocrats is less than the number of Senators
required to make a quorum.
BAD NEWS FOR SOME VETERANS.
Congressmen Discover That Local Medical
Examining Pension Boards Have Been
Put Under Civil Service.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 18.âCon
eressman Oversireet of Indiana to-day
discovered tbe fact that the local medical
examining pension boards have been put
under tbe civil service. This is informa
tion to the California Congressmen, all of
whom have on file many applications for
appointments on local boards. Commis
sioner of Pensions Murphy himself says
he was not, until very recently, aware of
this chance. He was apprised of it after
the opening of the present session of Con
gress.
This extension is of importance to
thousands of prospective pensioners in
California, who are anxiously awaiting
tbe appointment of new and more friendly
boards. In many instances applicants
have ielt that adverse rulings in their
cases resulted partially from an anxiety
on the part of the examining boards to find
reasons why pensions should not be
granted, and many pension claims have
been held back awaiting the appointment
of Republican boards under trie new ad-
ministration. Many Congressmen express
indignation at tnis latest deve'opment of
civil service txtension. It iÂ«? outrageous,
they say, that a President should be per
mitted to perpetuate in office petty offi
cials originally appointed largely on tbe
recommendation of their partisanship.
In such cases "civil service reform" is
merely the spoils system rendered more
offensive by conferring upon tne benefi
ciary a life interest in the spoils thus
bestowed. In this instance, unless
prevented by Congressional action it will
work injury to thousands of veterans now
kept from that which is justly clue them
by the Opposition of an unfriendly ad
ministration, which will be allowed to
keep its tentacles fastened upon the coun
try after its head has been cut off by the
people.
LONG AND SHORT HAUL.

WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 18.â The
Interstate Commerce Commission to-day
began the hearing on the application of

THEFTS OF A DISBURSING CLERK.
How Kieckhoefer Manipulated Trust
Fund* of tlir- State Department.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 18.â Tfce
Grand Jury has taken action in the case of
Francis J. Kieckhoefer, formerly disburs
ing clerk of the State Department, who is
charged on three counts with embezzle
ment of $17,000, of funds intrusted to bis
care while in the Government service.
The money is alleged to have been taken
by Kieckhcefer from the trust funds of
the State Department over which he had
control. It is part of the $139,000 shortage
discovered by an expert accountant in tue
accounts kept by Kieckhoefer.
Mr. Kieckhoefer was arrested some
months ago, but released on $15,000 bail.
He had previously resigned by direction
of Secretary Olney. Just what the action
of the Grand Jury was has not yet de
veloped, but a return of their finding is
expected in a day or two, and it is under
stood that it. is perfectly satisfactory to
the District Attorney. The matter has
hung fire for over a month.
China Accepts the Regulations.

A GRAND ANSWER TO A VENOMOUS LIE.
Citizens of San Jose Express Their Opinion of Mr. Hearst's " Examiner"
arid Its Methods.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 19, 1896.
OF INTEREST TO
THE PACIFIC COAST
No Appropriation Can Yet
Be Secured for Goat
Island.
Meanwhile Additional Boys Are
Being Enlisted in the Navy
for the Training School.
Preservation of Forests in the Cali
fornia Government Reservations
Is Being Urged.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 18.â The
commission to set apart land, on Goat
Island for the naval training station has
not yet made its selection, and in conse
quence nothing can be done at present to
secure an appropriation for its establish
ment. In the meanwhile, however, Ad
miral Riimsey, at the solicitation of Sen
ator Perkins, has made arrangements for
an increase in the enlistment of boys.
The admiral states that it is the intention
of the department to transfer the boys
now on the Independence, 100 in number,
to the Adam?, which is now on her way
from Honolulu, and use that vessel as a
cruising and training ship. This will eive
an opportunity for 100 more boys. When
this change can be accomplished, orders
will be iÃSued to Mare Island to continue
enlistments until they have 100 more boys.
Increased interest is being manifested ih
California as to the preservation of for
ests in Government reservations. The
Engineers' and Architects' Associa
tion of Southern California and the Sierra
Club have brought the matter to the atten
tion of Senator Perkins, whose aid has
been solicited. He realizes the importance
of the question and will endtavor to
secure legislation that will remedy some
of the evils now complained of. The con
nection between forest preservation and
irrigation in California is fully realized by
the California delegation.
The Agricultural Department has
placed at the disposal of Senators a large
number of packages of flower, vegetable
and field seed, which will be sent out soon
after the first of the coming year.
The Chief of Engineers has submitted to
Congress a report ol the Major Davis corps
of engineers on the preliminary examina
tion of Suisun Creek, California. Major
I Davis reports that an examination of the
I creek shows a tolerably wide and deep
I xlough with several shoal places, generally
jat tne bends. Tiie river is navigated by
j small fiat-bottomed sailing-vessels oi
about eighty tons, carrying only freight
and drawing abou: five feet of water, which
depth can carry them all the way to the
dock into town at high tide. In front of
the town's docks the flats are bare at low
tide. The naphtha launch was unable to
land on the return trip of Major Davis.
At some points there are sharp turns, he
says, and sailing vessels under headway
are in danger of running aground by get
ting out of the channel, particularly
where the latter is narrow, and may have
to wait twelve hours for a rising tide.
Thcne interested in the improvement of
the stream would be satisfied with a prac
ticable navigable depth of eight feet,
which could be secured at slight cost by
drodging a few places, cutting off one
point and making a cut-off through the
bend, 'i he town has issued bonds in tae
sum of $42,000 for the construction of
water works, and a contract has been let
for the work. It is claimed that a beet
sugar factory will be started when the
works have been completed.
A further examination of the creek will
be necessary to determine the cost of
improving it. Major Davis, while not
committing himself vositively in an opin
ion that the creek is worthy of improve
ment, thinks it seems to warrant further
examination and recommends a survey at
a cost of $600.
Colonel Suter, the division engineer, and
Chief of Engineers Craiehill indorse the
recommendation of Major Davis.
Representative McLachlan of California

CHICAGO, 111., Dec. 18.â A special
meeting of the California lines in the

meeting that the charges could not be
substantiated.
FORGER BENECKE DIES IN JAIL
And Now One of the Most Daring Gangs
That Ever Operated in the Coun
try is B re ken Up.
ALBANY, N. V., Dec. 18.â The most no
torious gang of forgers that ever operated
in tbe United States is now broken up.
No longer will the mention of the names
of Benecke, Beecker and Cregan cause
terror to the banking world. Benecke
died on Tuesday, and his associates,
Beecker and Cregan, are serving life terms
in a California penitentiary. Joe Me-
Cluskey and A. H.Dan, both members
of the Beecker-Beneckegang, were acquit
ted. It was through Dean's information
that Beecker and Cregan were arrested in
New York and sentenced.
Benecke was known as "the king of the
forgers," and he died on Tuesday morning
in the Albany County Jail. Until yester
day Chief of Police Willard did not know
that Benecke was dead. For some un
known reason Deputy Sheriff Trayer kept
the matter quiet. He had been confined
here since April 6 of the present year,
awaiting trial on an indictment cnarginz
him with forgery found against him by
the Grand Jury in April, 1893. The spe
cific charge against him was that on No
vomber 4, 1894, I.c had raised a draft on
the National Commercial Bank of this
city from $16 to $1600. H â  was arrested in
New York City just before leaving that
city for Europe, and brought to Albany.
Benecke was variously known as Wi
liam Walworth, David Johnson, Frank
Telferd, David Bolsen, Daniel Benecko
and Big Dan. He was 33 years old. The
disease of which he died was contracted
in prison in Tennessee, where he was con
j fined prior to his incarceration in this city.
' The Tennessee authorities disregarded the
claim of New York's Governor to the cus
tody of the forger.
Detective Nolan was dispatched to New
York to hunt him up. He found him on
Monday, April 6, as he was standing on
the dock of the Cunard steamship line
and placed him under arrest. Benecke
was buried Wednesday at Sandy Hill,
N, V., where his mother resides.
VICTIMS BY THE SCORE.
Detectires Oatherina In Members of a
Oattff of Mining Swindler*.
CHICAGO, 111., Dec. 18.â A morning
paper says: William H. McNutr, alias
George H. Linn, was to-day placed under
arrest at (be instance of a local detective
agency, which charges him with being a
member of an alleged eang of mining
stock swindlers. A. V. Cornell, with sev
eral aliases, has already been placed under
bonds and extradition papers are being
prepared for one B. C. Evans from Butte,
Mont.
Under various guises as ore brokers,
mining experts, gold mining stock owners
| and corporation officials Linn and his
partners have carried on, it is said, suc
cessful trading in fraudulent paper, mak
ing from $1000 to $2000 with comparatively
slight effort.
Investigation thus far tends to show
that A. S. Lie;, a real estate dealer, was
defrauded of $1000 last night. Mrs. Har
riet J. Warren, it is said, found herself a
victim to th â  extent of a dishonored draft
calling for $520 thrown out of a Butte
City bank.
It is believed by the victims, detectives
and reputable mining officials at Butte
City that the cane has made victims by
the score all over tbe country.
HEADING OFF REFORMERS.
Chicago Saloonmen Talk About Closing
for Four Month*.
CHICAGO. 111, Dec. 18.â A morning
paper publishes a story to the effect that
it is proposed by the saloonmen of Chi
cago to shut their shops for a period of
four months and thereby deprive the city
of revenue aggregating $1,000,000. This
policy was vigorously discussed yesterday
by the Cook County Liquor-dealers' As
sociation.
It was stated that the Civic Federation
and its allies were laying plans for prohib
itory legislation at the coming legi-lativa
session. The prospect of another Raines
law in operation in Chicaeo was anything
but plea-ing to the minds of the saloon
men. It was stated lhat the common en
emy should be taught a Jesson in political
economy if it persi-tsd in its attempts to
encroach upon the rights and privileges
o: the saloonmen. By a unanimous vote
the association agreed that this lesson
could best be conveyed by the voluntary
closing of all the saloons in Chicago for
four months.
This novel procedure, it ia claimed, will
deprive the city of so much money that
the "reform" element would quickly
understand that it had been playing a
losing g*me and would come to time.
Xo Swindling About It.
CHICAGO, 111.. DÂ«c. 18.â W. J. Chal
mers of Frazer & Chalmers, who supplied
the machinery for the Montana mine in
which Quigley & Mullen of Wilmington,
Del., were interested, said in reference to the
mining company: "There is no swindle
about the Delaware company's dealings.
The mines of the Golden Scepter Gold
Mining Company at Quigley, near Bonita,
Mont., are sure to be productive, as we
satisfied ourselves before entering into any
transactions with the company."
GOMPERS LEADS
THE ORGANIZATION
Re- Elected President of the
American Federation
of Labor.
All Oificers Retained Except the
Secretary, Who Gives Way
icr Morison.
First Vice â¢ President McGuire Not
Permitted to Dccl ne to Further
Serve.
CINCINNATI, Ohio, Dec. 18.â At this
morning's session o! tue convention of the
Federation of Labor a resolution was in
troduced by Delegate Ashe of Boston de
manding amendments to ;he constitution
of the United States preventing the re
viewing and setting aside of laws duly
enacted by the representatives of the
people.
The resolution elicited much discussion,
and was defeated by a vote of 44 to 21.
Delegate Lennon of the Journeymen
Tailors offered a substitute resolution
reaffirming the stand taken at the past
three conventions favoring the unlimited
coinage of silver at 16 to 1. Lennon's sub
stitute was carried by a vote of 1935;
against, 302.
A resolution that the American Federa
tion of Labor extend us moral and finan
cial support to the Colorado miners was
approved.
Delegate Weisemann offered a resolu
tion that the former action of the federa
tion favoring free coinage of silver at 16
to 1 be reconsidered, aad that as the work
ing men had become divided on silver the
best interests of tne federation would be
served by refusing to give it consideration.
Delegate Varnell offered a substitme, re
affirming the former action on the silver
question.
At the afternoon session the special
order for tfce annual election was deferred
to hear the report of the committee on
the president's report. It indorsed all the
recommendations of President Gompers
in every instance and was indorsed by a
unanimous vote of the convention. The
following officers were then elected, in
every case the secretary being instructed to
cast the unanimous vote of the convention
for the nominee:
President, Samuel Gompers cf New
York; rtrst vice-president, P. J. McGuire
of Pniladelphia; second vice-president,
James Duncan of Baltimore; third vice
president, James O'Connell of Chicago;
fourth vice* president, M. M. Garland oi
Pittsburg, Pa. ; secretary, Frank Morison
of Blouiningion, Hi. ; treasurer, John D.
Lennon of New York.
The only change in the list of officers
from those chosen at the last convention
was in the secretaryship.
In response to an enthusiastic call from
the delegates, President Gompers made a
Bhort address to the convention, thanking
it for its testimonial of confidence and
stating that in v;ew of recent circum
stances, hs practically unanimous re
election was one oi the greatest, if not the
greatest, satisfaction of his life.
Mr. McGuire, the first vice-president,
declined to be a candidate, stating that
after ten years of Service, in which time
he had seen the organization develop to a
point where he knew it was out of all
danger, and in view of the fact that his
own organization demanded all of the
time be had to give to it, he must with
draw in favor of younger men who could
probably serve the federation better than
he could. The delegates refused to enter
tain his declination and unanimously re
elected him, and when they called on him
for a speech, he simply rose to his feet
and said, "I am not satisfied."
Martin Fox and George E. McNeil were
elected fraternal delegates to the British
Trades Ljnion Cong! ess which is to assem
ble at Birmingham, England, on the firs*
Monday in September, 1897, and John B.
Lennon and Horace M. Eaton chosen as
alternates. The selection of a place for
holding the next annual convention being
in order, Nashvule, Term., Kansas City,
Sait Lake City and St. Louis were nomi
nated. On rollcall the vote resulted:
Nas iville 1618, Kansas City 338, Salt Lake
City 262, St. Louis 250.
The committee on the eight-hour move
ment handed in their report which in
structed the executive council to do every
thing in its power to attain tue end aimed
at, that the entire constituency of the A.
F. of L. strive for the accomplishment of
a universal eight-hour work day and that
aid would be furnished in sustaining the
contest in this'respect now on in the State
of Utah. The report was ordered printed
and will come up for action later.
The special committee report on
the Kansas City Armour Packing Com
pany, including the Armour Company in
Chicago, as they were satisfied the two
concerns were under one head and work
ing together in the fitfht against organized
labor, will come before the convention at
a future time, with all of the committee's
recommendations.
It was moved that when the convention
adjourn it be to reconvene at 7:30 o'clock.
Delegate Phillies of New York protested
that such action would be a bad example
for an organization righting for an eight
hour workday to set, and his protest met
with such an unanimous outburst of
approval that the motion was withdrawn.
The convention adjourned, to meet to
morrow morning at 9:30 o'clock.
SECRETARY ROOSE V ELT ARRIVES
Returns From England to Benefit His
Health and A'ot on Business.
NEW YORK. N. V., Dec. 18.-James R.
Roosevelt, secretary of the United States
Embassy in England, who suffered an at
tack of nervous prostration recently, ar
rived here to-day from England on the
Germanic. To a reporter he said: "While
I contemplate making an occasional trip
to Washington, the object of my return is
solely for the betterment of my health. I
shall remain here about three weeks. I
am not here on official business."
Regarding tbe contemplated gift to
Embassador Bayard by the British people
Secreiary Roosevelt said: "Erabassador
Bayard was in the north of England at
the time the matter was published and
knew nothing of it until his return to
London. He then lost no time in dis
claiming the gift, and certainly knew
nothing of criticism about it before tak
ing action. His prompt action endeu the
matter."
Concerning the feeling in England
toward Cuba Mr. Roosevelt said: "Cuban
affairs do not seem to greatly interest the
English. In fact, I do not recollect hav
in â¢ heard the subject discussed at all.
The election of Mr. McKinley was, how
ever, generally discussed, and great satis
faction was felt over his election, as it
caused a feeling among the people of Eng
land that Americans could be depended
upon to keep all obligations."
Profestor Herrmann's Remains.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 18.â The body
of Alexander Herrmann, the famous ma
gician, whose death occurred suddenly

moval to the Masonic Temple in tuis city.
Professor Herrmann was a Mason of high
degree, and it is probable that the funeral
will take place from the temple on San
day afternoon. The burial will probably
be la Wooiilawn cemetery.

the Report of Engineer*.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 18.â Judge
Maguire visited the supervising architect's
office to-day and had a talk with the chief
executive officer, Kemper, about the de
lay in beginning the construction of the
San Francisco postoffice building. Kemper
?nid the delay was dne to the fact the
War Department engineers had not sub
mitted their report on the foundation.
Three thousand dollars was appropriated
to ascertain what weight could be sup
| ported by such foundation as that at
j Seventh and Mission streets. Pending
receipt of tnis information the archi
tect's office can do nothing. When the
report of the engineers is received it will
be submitted for the approval of the
Secretary of the Treasury. This last re
port, it must be understood, has no refer
ence to tho borings which were made over
a year ago.

BERLIN, Germany, Dec 18. â The
Berlin Post publishes a report of there

"UP WITH YOUR PAWS."
A Peculiar Hold-Up That
Saved a Man's
Life.
AN UNDER - SHERIFF'S SENSE
Utter Disgust of a Train-Robber at
the Nervousness of a
Victim.
A small knot of men were telling stories
in the office of one of the most prominent
hotels on Montgomery street the other
day and they had got round to noted
stage-robberies, when a gentleman called
Morton, who is we^l known on the Corn
stock now, chipped in with one of the
queerest of all the tales of Dandits that
oas yet been heard.
He said: "Now, this happened less than*
a year ago, and I was acting Deputy!
Sheriff at the time. It was the same oftl-w
fashioned order to 'Come out of that, 1 for'
1 was riding on the inside, keeping cases
on a young fellow whose friends had
shipped him down to the city, for what
reason you'll see later on. There was no
chance for me to pull my gun or do a
blamed thing, and so I made up my mind
to watch developments mighty close, in
the hope that there might be some chance
of locating the 'beauties,' and so I did not
show right. I was out, and my hands
went up at word of command, but the
fellow that 1 was looking out for only
shook and shivered like a dog eating
razors and his hands never budged.
"Well, it didn't take a minute for the
robber to approach within half a foot of
him and poke his shooter right into his
nose. 'Up with those paws,' he howled,
'unless you want â ' and then 1 saw him
pause in astonishment. Why, the poor
young chap was so scared he couldn't
raise a hand. I bad pretty near to iaueh
myself, but I didn't. He went through
him with hands down, and after cursing
him for what he supposed to be and what
he called the 'lack of sand' he tried to hit
him with the butt end of his gun to show
his niter disgust, and as he drew back his
arm he said, 'You ought to be dead, any
way,' and with that down dropped the
fellow out of sheer fright. And. by
thunder, I thought he had died from fear.
Well, I got not a single show at his 'nibs'
and had to give up everything, gun and
all.
"As soon as they had cleared out I
went over to the chap lying on the
ground and found him still breathing
and, with the driver put him back in the
stage and we cot down here without any
more to do. But that's the only time I
ever heard of any one being gone throueli
with their 'paws' down, I thought he'd
shoot sure."
"What became cf the youngsterT"
asked a listener.
"Oh ! he got all rignt," said Mr. Morton.
"He wa> awful sick; been playing the
fool; got run down and diseased, and the
outcome was that he got that nervous be
couldn't cross the street. His folks told
me that he wasa 'goner,' but they wanted
to have him come down here lo see',
whether the doctors of ths Hudson Mcdi- k
cal Institute could do anything in the â¢
world for him, and as none of them
could come with him, why I came â
that's all there was to that. Well,
I just took him up there to the
Institute, at the corner of Market, Ellis
and Stockton streets, but by the Lord
harry, I had to pack him into the place.
'Ob, yes, he's sickâ very sick,' said one o<
the doctors, 'but he'll pull through.'
Well, they gave him one or two baths, I
think, and then I don't think that they
give him any more than one kind of
medicine. 'Hudyan' I thinfc they call it,
and in about two weeks he came back
home. He was all well again in IÂ«n than
three months. But I thought he was
dead when he fell down before that
bandit though. That was a hard one," he
concluded.
"How came he to hear of the Hudson
Ins uute?" a 'ked the former questioner.
"They send circulars about this great
remedy of theirs by mail to any one who
writes for them, I believe," said Mr. Mor
ton, "and his folks wrote to the doctors,
and when they saw all the testimonials
from the people that had been cured by
this 'Hudyan' they wanted him to come
down and try it. Oh, yes, he'd go stage
riding again now, for he ain't nervous like
that any more. He could hoid up his
hands now. That trip saved his life
though."

Major McKinley Receives
a Great Ovation at
Evanston.
College Boys Compel the Visitor
to Appear on the Porch, but
He Does Not Speak.
Neighbors of the Dawes Unite in
Entertaining the Distinguished
Statesman.
CHICAGO, 111., Dec. 18.â Major Me-
Kinley was the central figure in a front
porch episode to-night. The familiar
. scene was changed from his own front
porch to that of the residence of Charles
G. Dawes, in the classic suburbs of Evan
ston. The President-elect was drawn out
into the chilly air by the combined lune
power of half a thousand enthusiastic
students of the Northwestern University.
The distinguished visitor's presence in
their midst was well known to all Evan
stonians, and the college boys quickly or
panized in parade order. They marched
m an orderly, quiet body to the Dawes
i house, surrounded it and lustily cheered
.^for the next President of their country.
Major McKinley, accompanied by Mr.
. Dawes, satisfied their clamor by appear
ing in his campaign role, but this time he
declined to make a speech. He merely
bowed his appreciation of the compliment
and returned to his cozy quarters.
v Major McKinley had an excellent
night's rest and said this morning that he
already felt some benefit from the charge
and rest. Mr. and Mrs. McKinlev went
for an early morning drive in the bracing
.'*! 'ir> The rest of the day was spent indoors
.at the Mac Williams residence until it was
time to drive to the Northwestern Depot
to take the 3 o'clock regular train for
/.Evanston.. The Major was accompanied
â by Mr. Dawes and Captain H. O. Heis
land. United States army, who was also a
guest at Mr. Dawes' home to-night. They
arrived at 3:30 and soon after the three
men, accompanied by Mr. Dawes, went
â¢for a drive through the town. Thin even
ing, in an informal, social manner, numer
ous neighbors and fri' nds of the Dawes
lamily called to pay their respects to their
chief guest and help to mane the evening
pass pleasantly.
General William R. Day of Canton will
arrive in Evanston to-morrow morning
and have a conference with Major Mc-
Kinley at Mr. Dawes' house.
Mrs. McKinley is in better health than
she has been for two months, and it is
likely that she will go to New York City
early in the y*Â»ar to do some shopping.
Major McKinley will accompany her, ana
if they go it is suggested tbat they &pend a
fortnight at Atlantic City. The major
now talks of returning to Canton Monday
night. His chief political caller to-day
..'was Governor Upham of Wisconsin, who
â  urged the appointment of Henry C. Payne
to the Cabinet.

I SPRINGFIELD, 111., Dec. 18.â With
-the near approach oi the convening of the

contest fora Senator to succeed General
John M. Palmer will hs one of the most
bitter on record in this country. The fact
is due not bo much to political divisions,
for the Republicans have an overwhelming
..majority on joint ballot, but rather to the

â .worn by Lyman Trumbull, Stephen A.

â  City Council the Fourth Ward ot the city,
which includes in its area a portion of the
â¢notorious levee and a big slice of the

ONLY THE REGULAR RATES.
Washington Hotels Will Aot Overcharge
Jturing the Inaugural.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 18.â Reports
having been circulated in Philadelphia and
other cities to the effect that Washington
hotels had entered into a combination to
Charge exorbitant rates during the inaug
ration week, Chairman Bell of the inaugu
ration committee authorizes an explicit
denial of the report. Chairman Bell said:
"I have caused a ailigent inquiry to be
made of the different hotels, and I find
the story to be absolutely untrue. So far
as I can find no hotel proposes to charge
more than the usual rates at such times."
Ad indications point to the largest
crowd ever seen in Wathington at any in
auguration and preparations are well un
der way for the entertainment and care of
the visitors upon that occasion, and with
the well-known ability of Washington to
properly handle large crowds no fears
need be entertained of extortion or lack o
accommodations for alt who may come.
JiJBIAS DEFINES DEMOCRACY.
The Chicago Platform Good Enough for

RICHMOND, Va., Dec. 18.â The State
of this evening prints a letter from Hon.
Messrs. W. J. Bryan, R. P. Bland, W. J.
Stone, George Fred Williams and John T.
Morgan in reply to a query sent out from
that paper as to what, in the view "of those
gentlemen, constituted Democracy. Mr.
Bryan's letter read:
I Lincoln. Nebr., Dec. 10, 1896.
A To the Editor of the State : 1 have not time to
answer your questions at length. In a broad
tense a democracy is a government which the
people run, and a Democrat is one who be
-1 ieves in such a government. In a party sense,
Democracy is defined by the Chicago platform.
and the person who supports the party and its
platform can call himself a Democrat. The
platform Is entirely satisfactory. to me. In my
, judgment it applied Democratic principles to
present condition* , If a minority has a right
to give a party definition of Democracy, then
there may be as many different definitions of
Democracy as there are persons who desire to
Wear the name. Yours truly.

MADE TO WED
ONE SHE HATED
Miss Jose's Disappearance
From a Fresno Ranch
Explained.
Was Abducted by a Suitor and
Forced to Become His
Bride.
Escaped From Her Husband and Now
Brings Suit to Annul the
Marriage.
FRESNO, Cal., Dec. 18.â Henrietta Jose
did not elope with Joseph Nestor from the
home of her brother-in-law, George Car
lisle, near Jameson in the western portion
of the county last Saturday night, as was
supposed. She arrived in Fresno to-day
with Carlisle and her father, and stated
that Nestor had kidnaped her. He forced
her to accompany him to Hanford, where
they were married against her will. As
soon as an opportunity presented itself she
left him and returned to her relatives.
She came to Fresno to-day to place the
case in the hands of the District Attorney
to prosecute Nestor, and also to bring an
action to have the marriage annulled.
The suit was filed with the County Clerk
this afternoon.
Mrs. Nestor was interviewed by a Call
correspondent this evening. She said that
Nestor, who was working on the Carlisle
ranch, had been paying her attentions,
but on all occasions she had rejected
them. She was already betrothed to Ed
ward Weir, who lives at Berenda. Mrs.
Nestor is 19 years of age and pretty, and
she told her story frankly.
"Last week," she said. "I flatly told
Nestor that his suit was hopeless and that
I would not become his bride. He did not
receive my reply with very pood grace and
I feared he meditated harm, consequently
I determined to see him Saturday evening
and reason with him. I wns at the time
the guest of my sister, Mrs. George Car
lisle, and cave him permission to call
upon me at her home.
"I met him Saturday evening outside
the house. Until long after midnight he
pleaded with me to marry him, but I
steadfastly refused. He would not let me
leave him and go into the house, nor
would he depart. Finally, seeing I was
not to be coaxed into an engagement, he
told me that if I did not immediately ac- j
cept him he would do hia utmo3t to
blacken my character.
" 'I'll slander you before 10 o'clock to
morrow,' were the words he used.
"Although he could not truthfully
accuse me of any wrong I feared he might
tell a lot of stories that would grieve my
relatives and friends and I became bauly |
frightened. Finally he seized me and
dragged me toward his buggy, which was
standing near us. I resisted, but he said
if I refused to come or if I made any out
cry he would do his worst. Then he
dragged me to the buggy, forced me to get
in and drove off.
"He first took me to the home of George
Miller and then to Hanford, where we
were married on Tuesday. Before we
were married I told him I would not
under any circumstances become his bride,
but he said only one course was left open
to me. I knew no one in Hanford and had
no means of informing my parents of my
plight. He continued to threaten me,
saying I should never marry Fred Weir of
Berenda, to whom I was engaged. Finally
we were married and then he drove back
to the Miller home. When my mother
heard Pwas there she came after me and I
returned with her to my own home.
"1 never would have married Nestor if I
had not been frightened into it and I will
not live with him as his wife."

tained. The decision is hailed with much
joy by all those interested in the welfare
of debating in general. Heretofore no
special attention has been given the de
baters, such as has been accorded the par
ticipants in other intercollegiate contests.

society a month ago the members agreed
to discontinue such practice. Thisarou^ed
the ire of several societies, and a move
ment was started in the Sons of St. George

Suicide "t Santa Crux.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal, Dec. 18.â Robert
Fulion Ford, one of the oldest residents of
Santa Cruz County, committed suicide by
taking laudanum in the willows above the
upper bridge near Blame street to-day.
About twenty years ago ho conducted the
old Cottage saloon, a well-known resort
for the rounders, who gave him the sobri
quet "Sweet Cider." He later resided at
Watsonville and Soqnel. The cause of
the suicide was the service of a citation
upon him to appear in court to give an
accounting of his estate, which has been
for some time in litigation. Grief over the
loss of his wife also had much to do with
the tragedy. He was 74 years old.
Santa Crux Hotel Reopened.

SPENCER'S HEIRS
STRIVE IN COURT
Children of the Capitalist
Accuse the Widow of
Fraud.
Allege That She Married Him
to Gain Possession of His
Property.
Sensational Charges Made in a Suit
Brought to Reccvar the
Estate.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Dec. 18.â The
hearing of the remarkable suit of Isabel
Spencer against Mrs. Anna P. Spencer to
set aside deeds to a large amount of real
estate in this county was begun here to
day. The defendant is the relict of Am
brose H. Spencer, whose peculiar and
tragic death occurred about eighteen
months ago. The old gentleman was
found dead in bis bed one morning and it
was believed that he had been murdered,
but it was at last decided that he had
taken an overdose of morphine, probably
with suicidal intent. He had large prop
erty intere.-ts, and it developed that ail
the estate, consisting of real and personal
property, had been deeded to Mrs. Spencer
during the lifetime of her aged husband.
Spencer was survived by two children by
a former wife, Eva J. Spencer and James
G. Spencer. They were not satisfied with
the disposition of the $100,000 worth of
property and assigned their interests to
the plaintiff in the pending action, Isabel
Spencer, who began the suit which is now
up for trial.
The allegations are of a sensational na
ture. It is claimed by the plaintiff that
the widow Spencer, prior to her marriage
with Dr. Spencer, conceived a plan to de
prive him of his property, and being a
woman of great strength of mind and de
termination she carried her plan into exe
cution. It is further alleged that he was
of a timid disposition and was as wax in
the hands of his wife. It i 3 averred that
she encouraged him in the use of mor
phine until lie became addicted to the
habit, aud finally was completely subject
to her control, and that while thus in
capable of independent volition he was
induced by her to execute deeds to his
holdings and turn over to her all his per
sonal property.
Reference is made in the complaints to
the tragic death of Ambrose Spencer and
to Mrs. Spencer's connection with the di
vorce suit between Mr. and Mrs. D. E.
I Newton, in which she was accused of
j having been the cause of their troubles.
This portion of the pleadings has hereto
fore been stricken out by the court.
The allegations are all denied by the
defendant, who claims that the property
was acquired by her late husband through
the use of her own means, and that its
being deeded to her was the strictest jus
tice- Allegations are made that the de
| ceased had given his children large sum>
of money at various times. She denies
that sne encouraged Mr. Spencer in the
use of morphine and states that bhe re
monstrated with him at times regarding
the habit. Ail charges of undue influence
are also denied.
OPEN TO BOTANISTS.
Students Seed Pay -\o Toll* on the Santa
Jtionicti Forestry Station.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Dec 18.â The
City Council is in receipt of an official
communication, setting forth that at a
meetine of the regents of the State Uni
versity, held on December 8, resolutions
were adopted which insist that the for
estry station at Santa Monica has always
been open and always will be for any re
sponsible botanists to pursue their studies
without paying tolls. The Democratic
County Convention in October adopted a
resolution for an open station, which was
passed without any apparent knowledge
of the facts. Tho Chamber of Commerce
in August last also adopted a similar reso
lution. The university resents deny em
phatically the imputations made against
the management ot the station, and appear
to blame Abbott Kinney of this city for
the trouble which has been raised in the
matter. The regents say in their com
munication that any specific charges of in
sincerity or other dereliction by any of
the employes of the station should be re
ferred to them for official ratification.

RURALES BALKED
GARD'S VENTURE
Dunham Search Abandoned
Because of Mexican
Opposition.
The Posse Certain of Arrest if
the Boundary Was
Crossed.
Steps Taken to Secure Co-operation
for an Expedition 6e!ow
the Line.
SAN DIEGO. Cal., Dec. 18.âConsider
able information regarding the search
made by Sheriff Lyndon of San Jose and
ex-Marshal Gard of Los Angeles for Mur
derer James E. Dunham leaked out to
day. It was learned on the best authority
that the officers had secured what they
believed to be an authentic "tip" leading
them toward the Mexican border, and
even below the line. They intended, when
they left here, to penetrate into Mexico,
even though they knew it was against
tne law for armed posses to enter a neigh
boring country. They hoped to keep
their mission and destination so secret
that the Mexican authorities would not
suspect anything, and then, after Dun
ham's capture, they hoped either to hurry
him across the line without any nonsense
about requisition papers or else to appeal
to Mexico's President and chief officers
in order to secure the co operation of the
Lower California officials.
Through the loquacity of a local mem- i
her of the party the scheme fell Hat. The |
errand of Sneriff Lyndon was known be- I
fore his arrival here and friends of Dun
ham, if they had been so minded, could
easily have posted him on the Sheriffs ,
mission and tne probable destination of
the part}*. The Mexican officials knew to
a certainty- that the American posse was
headed for the Mexican line and would
probably enter Mexico without warrant of
law or special permission. It was on tbis
account that Governor Sangines was
hastily notified and orders sent by him
for the gathering of a posse of twelve
rurales at Tia Juana to co-operate with
another posse at Niji to head off the
Americans and warn them out of the
eountiy. If they refused to go the co
mandante of the Mexican party was under
orders to arrest the whole party and con
vey it to Ensenada, the Americans to be
treated as prisoners charged with being
filibusters entering a foreign state with
which the United States is at peace.
Just how Marshal Gard and Sheriff Lyn
don learned of the hasty but effective ac
tion of the Mexicans is not known, but it
is presumed that on account of the im
portance of its mission the posse had se
cured the assistance of Mexican residents
of Ensenada or Tia Juana to keep them
posted regarding the movements of Mexi
can efficers. Gard is well acquainted be
low the line and could eaÃily secure such
help.
With plans made for the departure and
no signs of suspicion on the part of the
Mexicans Gard and Lyndon started out.
They had hardly left for Dulznra, how- '
ever, before the Mexicans notified Gov- !
ernor Ban sines, who in turn lost no time |
in ordering out the rurales. The red- j
shirted guardians of the peace below the |
line wanted nothing better than to give â 
chase to a lot of gringoes, especially men
who might be charged with serious crimes
afier captured, and they burnished their j
carbines, loosed to their sabers and in
spected the cinches on their wiry mus
tangs while awaiting orders at Tia Juana
to give chase.
Wtile Gard, Lyndon and the two San
Diego Hawk-*haws were running about in
the hills of Duizura and looking longingly
across the Mexican line tiie rurales were
making for the spot post haste, armed and
ready to give battle to the Americans if
they entered Mexican territory. Gard
evidently learned of this, as he never al
lowed his party to cros3 the border except
when the coast was ci<ar, and then only
for a mile or so. He was too shrewd to be
caught napping by the Mexicans.
There was a good deal of ground to be
covered on this side of the line, inasmuch
as the posse did not know the exact loca
tion of the "Robbers' Roost' spoken of by j
Murderer Dunham in his famous letter to I
his wife. Gard prevailed upon his party j
to forego the pleasures of a chase after
Dunham over the Mexican line, where
they were quite sure he would be found,
and a thorough exploration was made of
the rough and unsettled country sur
rounding Dunham's bee ranch at Duizura.
Of course nothing was found.
So the posse returned to San Diego.
Gard and Lyndon, chagrined by the fail
ure of their mission, told a cock-and-bull
story of pursuing another man entirely,
and both solemnly denied that they were
not after Dunham. But Gard was not de
spondent over the matter. It is known
that he hardly returned to civilization be
fore he set a movement on foot to secure
the proper papers authorizing him to en
ter Mexico and enlisting the Mexican offi
cials in his behalf. If he is successful in
his application to the authorities at the
City of Mexico a new expedition will start
out within a few days, headed direct for
the Cocopah Mountains below the line,
where Gard and Lyndon believe Dnnham
is located.
Sheriff Lyndon returned north to-day,
presumably for his home at San Jose.
Marshal Gard went to Los AnÂ«ele3.

CAUGHT NEAR BURUKA.
Two Men Wanted for an Alleged Crime
at Reno.
EUREKA, Cal., Dec. 18.â C. D. Taggart
and William McGlotchin are held in jail
here awaiting the arrival of an officer with
extradition papers for their return to
Reno, Nevada, where they are wanted
upon charges of obtaining money under
ialse pretenses. The men refuse to talk,
and nothing can be learned regarding the
alleged crime. All that is known is that
the two Jeft Reno in a cart about three
months ago and were traced to this county
by the movements of the wife of Tapgart,
who is McGlotchin's sister. Mrs. Taggart
was registered at the Russ House in San
Francisco about the time the men left
Reno, and shortly afterward she left on a
steamer lor this city. By watching her,
the men were located near Ferndale,
where they were engaged in chopping
wood.
Taggart is about 40 years old and Me-
Glotchin about 30. Both have the appear
ance of laboring men. Tagjjart's wife is

OREGON CITY ROBBERY.
Expert Cracksmen Open a Posioffice Safe
and Carry Away Its Entire
Contents.
PORTLAND, Or., Dec. 18.â A telegram
was received this morning in the United
States District Attorney's office from Post
master S. R. Green of Oregon City, stating
that the postoffice had been entered last
night by burglars. The safe was robbed
and about $2000 iii money, registered let
ters and stamps taken. The burglars were
not only experts at their business but
were evidently members of a well organ
ized gang that has recently arrived in
Oregon from California. Their work on
the Oregon City safe waa identical with
that of the burglars who on Wednesday
night last blew open the safe of the Hub
bard postoffice. After that job they went
to Oregon City, and they no doubt are in
Portland now.
The postoffice in Oregon City occupies
the rear of a large store on the main street,
the front ot the room being occupied as a
stationery and cigar store. Tiie burglars
effected an entrance by prying open a rear
door with a 'â¢jimmy." They must have
first gone to the cigar-stand, which was
mulcted of its choicest cigars and a few
tents in change left in the money drawer.
They then went at the safe of Postmaster
Green, opening it and taking every possi
ble thing of value it contained. Even the
private papers of Mr. Green, which could
be of no value to them, and trie pennies
in the stamp drawer, were confiscated.
Secret Service Inspector Gordon, who
has been at Hubbar.i investigating the
burglary there, was intercepted while re
turning this, afternoon, and is now in
Oregon City.
Two mem bers of the gang, it is believed,
are in custody at Newberg. Their names
are given as Howard Graton and Sam
Bowman. Graton confessed to tiaving
pilfered a Lafayette dry-soods house.
Both men had a preliminary examination
at Newberg to-day and were held to the
Grand Jury. Bowman is said to kuow
something about the $000 burglary of
Bord's store at Dayton.
AUBURN STAGE HOLD-UP.
Bandits Loot the Georgetown Coach for
the Second Time Within Twenty-
Four Hours.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Dec. 18.â Felix
Tracy, agent and assistant superintendent
of Wells, Fargo Â«fc Co., to-night received a
dispatch stating that the Auburn and
Georgetown stage was held up again this
evening at about the same hour (5 o'clock)
and place of the hold-up yesterday. As
on yesterday tho express-box was taken
from the stage and broken open, but again
the bandits were disappointed, for it con
tained no treasure.
The probability is that the highwaymen
have had reason to believe that there was
to be a shipment of money about this time
to some point in the mines of El Dorado,
and having missed ii yesterday they ex
pected to get it to-day.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 19, 1896.
SEAMEN IN LINE
FOR SAN PEDRO
Favor the People's Harbor
Because There Is No
Undertow.
Compare Santa Monica's Inlet
to the Dangerous One at
Callao.
Published Interviews in "The Call"
Disastrous to Huutington's
Scheme.
LOS ANGELES, Cal, Dec. 18.â The
friends of the free harbor at San Pedro
read with great interest and undisguised
elation the interviews with a large num
ber of seafaring officials printed in The
Call of yesterday respecting the constant
and dangerous undertow at Santa Monica.
For some inexplicable reason tliis had not
received the attention from the San Pedro
advocates which its importance deserved.
As was well said by one of the sea cap
tains, who spoke of this matter:
"A strong and treacherous undertow
cannot be circumvented by any break
water ever devised."
The interminable annoyance to ship
ping and frequent losses at Callao, to
which the seamen compare Santa Monica,
seem to emphasize the folly of construct
ing a breakwater over these dangerous
undeÂ»currents. While the existence of the
undertow has long been known to marine
officers, little or nothing has been said
about it by the people who are engaged in
the harbor fight.
Taking its cue from The Call's article,
the Free Harbor League has opened this
important branch of the inquiry and will
nuw see to it that a generous amount of
information on the subject is supplied to
the commission, which will begin holding
regular sessions with a view of hearing
just such lacts and arguments next Mon
day.
The commission visited San Pedro to
day, going down over the Terminal rail
way, General Manager Hynes acting as
conductor. On reaching the port Mr.
Hynes got teams and the visitors were
driven out to the lighthouse on the bluff
overlooking what it is hoped will be the
outer harbor for Los Angeles. A steam
launch was boarded and a trip was made
from Dead Man's Island by the break
water of the inner harbor to Terminal
Island and then the visitors came back to
their hotel here.
The board wishes it understood that
these vi;its are not for the purooso of
making a detailed study of the two places,
but solely to familiarize the Commission
ers with the topography, so that at the
public meetings, which will commence on
Monday, they will have a thorough under
standing of the points described by the
speakers. The Commissioners are con
stantly the center of a throne of visitors,
both of the interested localities having
their representatives constantly on duty,
while the Free Harbor League keeps well
informed of the progress made and is well
prepared for the contest.
' To-morrow the commission wili make
the trip from San Pedro to Santa Monica
by water, taking the coast survey steamer
Gedney at the former port and sailing to
the latter. This will complete its inves
tigations preliminary to the public hear
ings. Alter these are concluded the board
will conduct its own investigations and
studies and come to a conclusion.

Alter dinner the Commissioners received
a great number of callers, the majority of

in no case was the conversation permitted

into an expression ot opinion one way or

EXCESSIVE DIVIDENDS PAID.
Stockholder Hendricks Makes Serious
Charges Against Directors of the
Manhattan Railway.
ALBANY, N. V., Dec. 18.â A sensa
tional case was beeun before the Attorney-
General of the State of New York to-day.
Mortimer Hendricks of New York City, a
bondholder of the Manhattan Railway
Company, who owns and operates the
elevated railway system of New York
City, made application to Attorney-
General Hancock, asking him to bring
final action against the directors
of the Manhattan Company for judgment,
compelling it to pay back to the rail
road company most of the money paid to
the stockholders in dividends in excess of
the sui plus profits and removing ihe di
rectors from office and restraining them
and their successors in office from declar
ing any payine dividends in excess of the
profits of the corporation.
Mr. Hendricks was directed to serve no
tice of his application upon the directors
of the company and a hearing was set be
fore the Attorney - General for next
Wednesday. Mr. Hendricks asserts that
during the year ending June 30, 1895, the
company paid $1,800,000 dividends, which
was $277,951 in excess of their surplus
profiis, anrt that during the year ending
June 30, 189G, the company paid the same
amount of dividends, which was $681,902
in excess of the surplue profits of the com
pany. He says that since June 30, 1896,
the directors declared a quarterly dividend
amounting to $450,000, although the net
income was only $147,000.
He claims that the earnings of the cor
poration have not been sufficient during
the last two year 3to pay the expenses of
operating the road, its fixed charges and
the dividends on stock by about $1,020,000.
and he charges the fact to be that the ex
cess of dividends over the profits have not
been paid out of the surplus, but out of
loans made by the corporation, and that
thus a debt was created to pay excess
dividends amounting to over $1 000,000
The directors who Hendricks desires
the court to remove from office are George
J. Gould, Edwin Gould, Howard Gould,
Russell Sage, Thomas T. Eckerl, gamuel
Sloan, Robert M. Galloway, Donald Alac
kay, Joseph Eastman, A. L. Hopkins, Gi
P. Morosini, Warren B. Smith and John
J. Terry.
The officers of the company are: Presi
dent, George J. Gould; secretary and
treasurer, D. W. McWilliams, and the
general manager, \\ . J. Franzioli.

WILD SCENE IN THE CHAM BER.
Italian Statesmen Get Excited Over the
Allowance of a Prince.
ROME, Italy, Dec. 13.â A sensational
scene occurred in the Chamber of Depu
ties to-day over the allowance for the
Prince of Naples. In the course of the de
bate Signor Costa, Socialist, declared that
the monarchy was not only a useless but
a dangerous institution. The President
or the Chamber forbade him to speak fur
ther. A frightful uproar ensued. Depu
ties flew at one another's throats. Some
exchanged knockdown blows. The tumult
continued fora long time. Finally tne
bill granting the annual allowance of
1,000,000 francs was carried amid great con
fusion.
Just where the most blame lies for the
shocking scene it is hard to say. All the
Deputies were greatly excited and many
did not realize what they were doing. The
whole city is stirred up over the affair.
CORBETT CALLS THE BET.
Anxious to Fight Hiztitnmons for All
Be Can Put Up.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 18.â "He
wants to rj^ht for 120,000, do?s he?" said
James J. Corbett yesterday, alter he read
what Fitzsimmons had to say about the
proposed right. "Well, I'll tight him for
$20,000, or $25,000, or $50,000, or any sum
he may name.
"If he means business let him send a
check to the stakeholder for the amonnt
he wants to fight me for. I will put up
any amount he may name in the hands of
the stakeholder to-morrow.
"Or let him name the amount he wants
to light for and agree to forfeit the $2500
already up if he does not put up the whole
sum. I'll sign articles agreeing to forfeit
the $2500 I have up if 1 do not put up the
side het agreed. I want to fight and am
Willing to tight now or on March 17, or for
any such bat as Fitzsimmous may care
to name."
Corbett was very earnest in his talk, and
evidently sincere. He wants to fight and
is willing that the battle shall be for a
large stake.

CHILDREN'S DAY
AT FRESNO'S FAIR
Hundreds of Little Tots
Admitted to the Big
Pavilion.
Gaza in Awe at the Display and
Sample the Fruit on
Exhibition.
Dimeless Youngsters Allowed to Eater
While the Doorkeeper Is
Not Looking
FRESNO, Cal., Dec. 18. â This wp
school-children's day at the San joaquin
Valley Citrus Fair. " The public schools
and the parochial schools closed at noon,
and before 1 o'clock children were flocking
from every direction toward the pavilion.
Some of the little ones could not stay long
enough at home to eat their luncn.* They
came to the main entrance eating bread
and butter, with the butter side down,
chewing gingerbread and biting apples,
just like the most aged exhibitor at the
lair used to do long years ago.
A double force of ticket sellers was on
duty. The children planked down their
dimes and riled in in open-eyed wonder at
what they saw beyond the entrance. There
were quite a number of sad little boys and
girls outside who had no dime. Papa was
out of work or sick, or there was no fire in
the bouse.
It is not very cold in the San Joaquin
Valley in the winter, but a little lire takes
trie chill out of the atmosphere and mafies
a home more comfortable, and if during
the afternoon there was any picture that
the sight of the happy children inside and
the unhappy ones outside brought to the
minds of "ye older folks," it was the pic
ture of John Howard Payne's "Home,
Sweet Home," in all its color of recollec
tion and melody of domesticity :
Backward, turn backward, O Time in your flight;
Make me a child again, just for to-night,
Quoted a fond father as he gazed at his
two happy and well-dressed little daugh
ters.
One of tne San Joaqum's greatest attrac
tions is its homes â happy, prosperous and
decked with flowers. "Be it ever so
humble" there are few homes in this
beautiful valley that have not at least
their flower.*, even at Christmastide. Fre
quently in the speeches made during the
fair the valley has been referred to as the
long-lost garden of Eden, now found. If
it is not quite Paradise it is a city of
homes.
The dimeless children outside did not
stand long in the shadow of disappoint
ment. Doorkeepers Kite and Ewing
turned their backs and were deeply and
deftly engaged in conversation. The dime
less children disappeared magically. In a
few moments not one was to be seen. One
of the management, it is said, had beck
oned and pointed the way to the door. A
Dlack-robed sister of charity who stood by
wiped away a tear and smiled.
There were not less than 2000 present
They simply took the fair by storm. They
captured the oand and the bandstand and
the management and everything else
almost. The unrelenting exhibitor with
his conspicuous sign, "Do not handle the
exhibit?," melted before the children.
Many an orange and appie and almond
and walnut and raisin and prune, which
money could not tempt from its place of
exhibition before,, went as a gift into the
chubby-fist of j'oung America or between
the clinging lingers of little Miss Colum
bia. Not a single thing was vulgarly
"swiped."
After they became tired of sightseeing,
the children played hide and sees among
the beautiiul piles of oranges and lemons
and flowers. The band played several
selections pleasing to little ones.
The children of the Park-street School
sang "America" and "The Battle Hymn
of the Republic," and the children of the
K-sireet School sang "Jingle Balls" and
"Columbia, Gem ot the Ocean." There is
measles in the Orphan School so the little
orphans could not come. A jollier crowd
never attended the fair. Like Brownies
the children swarmed everywhere. Ex
actly 2991 persons attended the fair to
day.
It has been decided to continue the fair
into next week. This is to give the pec
ple of San Francisco and the whole State
a longer opportunity in which to see the
citrus wonders. The fair will be continued
through Monday and will close on Mon
day night. The Pavilion will be open on
Sunday. Excursions are coming on Sun
day Irom Stockton, Porterville and other
towns of the valley. A very large num
ver oi visitors is expected on that day.
The San Francisco excursionists arrived
to-nisiht. They will be formally received
in the morning and to-morrow evening
there will be a public reception and
speeches at the pavilion. In the after
noon the visitors will be taken for a drive
over the city. A. R. Biggs will deliver
the welcoming address an<t Hugh Craig of
San Francisco will respond.
Saturday is formers day and also Por
terville day. The fruit-grower and farmer
from every place under the surrounding
horizon is expected to drive in to-morrow
with his family and team.
The Stockton excursion train returned
to the Mill City this afternoon. Quite a
number of Stocktonians remained over to
see the fair through.
Colonel Shew has added to the San
Joaquin County exhibit a Stockton scene,
showing water ana railroads, ships, loco
motives and cars â "where the rails meet
the sails."
The exhibitors are puzzled. Not one
amonglthem has been informed of the name
of a single judge. This has been kept
secret oy the management. The exhibitor
feels himself lost. When a man who
appears to know trim when he sees it
pauses before his exhibit he does not know
wnether to sruil , look pleasant and give
him the "glad hand" under the suspicion
that he is a judge, or to assume the "glassy
eye" a3 he wouid before an ordinary
spectator.
Late to-night it leaked out among a very
few that the judges on the quality of fruit
are Mr. Woods of Whittier, Supervisor
Sayre of Fresno and Mr. Hobb* of the
Hobos-Parsons Company. Considerable
dissatisfaction is likely to arise over the
selection of these judges, as two of them
have fruit on exhibit
Among those who are nursing a griev
ance in regard to the method of awarding
prizes is "Uncle Dan" Thomas, the
"widows' friend" of Visaiia. How "Uncle
Dan" acquired the affixed title is a legend
of this section of the valley. Some years
ago he had in his nursery a lot of fruit
trees which he could neither sell nor keep
until the following year, as they would
then be too large. He haa it circulated
throughout the valley that be would
give 135 trees, embracing â which word
the narrators of the story say is a very
good one to use in connection
with it â embracing every variety of
fruit, to all the widows in the valley
who would apply for them. The result
was that "Uncle Dan' 1 gave away 7290
fruit trees to fifty-four San Joaquin
widowa; hence the name "widows' friend. "
Subsequent events showed that Daniel
was long-headed. The next se.nson he
sold over $3000 worth of nursery stoclc to
the widows in recognition of th 6 previous
season's generosity.
There is considerable talk among com
mitteemen of the Midwinter Citrus Fair
and leading growers of the valley in favor
of making a protracted exhibit of San
Joaquin Valley citrus fruits nt Chicago
next winter, and calling it .the San
Joaqain California's Citrus Fair. II this
is doneâ and it is quite probable that it
will beâ an exhibit will be got together
which will excel the present fair and open
the eyes of the Chicaeoese. The valley
will also be represented at the Hamburg
(Germany) Horticultural Exposition,
which will be opened next May.
The town of Lindsay's exhibit is very
unique, it represents a fort. Oranges
piled in regulation style represent can
non-balls and gleaming on the muzzles ot
several miniature mortars are orange
shells. From the flagstaff flies the name
"Lindsay."
Sagendnrf Pleads Gutlty.
FRESNO, Cal., Dec. 18. â Franlc C.
Sagondorf, whose wife died in this city a
few days ago of a broken heart because of
his heartless treatment of her, was brought
bark from Riverside by Deputy Constable
Crutcher this morning. He was imme
diately taken beiore Justice St. John,
where he pleaded guilt> to a charge of
petty larceny â the theft of a pair of
trousers from a friend. The officers are
working on more serious charges against
him.
DO NOT DESIRE THE CUT
Richmond Residents Say the
Sutter-Street Extension Is
Unnecessary.
An Improvement Association Scored
by a Citizens' Meetingâ Vote
of Thanks.
The residents of Richmond district, who
oppose the extension of Sutler street
through Odd Fellows' Cemetery, are elated
at the action of the' Board of Supervisors
in postponing action in the matter for
sixty days. A meeting of the citizens and
taxpayers, who have opposed the project,
was held in Crossthwaite's Hall, at the
corner of Fifth and Point Lobos avenues,
last evenin?. The meeting was somewhat
in the nature of a ratification meeting, and
incidentally the Richmond Improvement
Association, which presented the petition
asking for the extension, and more par
ticularly C. H. Hubbs, president of the
association, came in for considerable
severe criticism.
Mr. Fletcher made quite a lengthy state
ment of the reasons which prompted
property-holders to oppose the extension.
"In the opening of Sutter street," he said,
"Mr. Hubbs states that this district will
not be assessed. Under the laws of the
State of California the Board of Supervis
ors is powerless to make a special appro
propriation for such a purpose without
the consent of the Legislature. Then it
will have to wait until the next fiscal year.
That appropriation is only for purchasing
the land. It is not for making the road.
"To make a 6 percent grade they will
have to cut it down nearly sixty ffet in
solid rock. Who is going to pay for it?
[A voice, 'Richmond.'] Certainly, we
will have to pungle down in our pockets
for the coin. I for one am going to ob
ject."
James Bowban made a Keenly sarcastic
speech, in which he impugned the mo
tives oi those who have been urging the
Supervisors to have the cut made. Hubbs,
he declared, was in the employ of the
Cypress Lawn Cemetery Association.
Edward Ginsey moved that a vote of
thanks be extended to the Board of Su
pervisors for posiponing action for sixty
days. The motion carried unanimously.

any relief. Dr. W. K. Vance, at the State
Electro-Medical Institute, made a careful
examination of my case and pronounced
it one of Bronchial Asthma. He placed
me under a course of electrical treatment
with medicines combined, and I at once
besan to pick up, and am now wonder-
fully improved in health and spirits. As
this is the first and only relief thaw I have
obtained from my distressing complaint I

Norman Jarmao, Novelist and
Speculator, Remembers He
Has a Son.
TLe Millionaire Writes From England
Asking His Son to J)in
Him.
Ira James Jarman, better known as Ira
James Hail, has received good news from
England.
This good news, which is rich enough
to rill a Christmas plum puddinc, is noth
ing more nc-r leas than a letter from a
long-silent parent who at last finds time
and inclination to write his son to come
and visit him in i:is English home and
help him spend $:6,t00,000. .
Twenty-six millions, all well invested,
(sixteen millions in property comprising
nearly a!l tne business portion of Salt

A Mates in old England.
* Twenty-odd years aeo Norman William
1 Jarman, a young Englishman of an ad
venturous spbit, joined a band of coloniz
ers that established themselves in Salt
Lake City.
Shortly after his arrival in the land of
the great prophet young Jarman joined
The Mormon ciiurch and incidentally in
vested in mints and santi lots. He mar
ried a comply young woman, and thÂ«> fruit
of this union is young Jarman, familiarly
known as Ira Hall.
Jarmau's marriage was not a nappy
one, and when little Ira was but 3 years
bid Mrs. Jarnjan was granted a divorce on
the ground 01 cruelty.
After his divorce Jarman took up the
cudcels against the established Mormon
churcn and began a lecturing tour, in
which he bitterly assaiied the creed of the
Ltitter-day Saint?.
Then for nineteen years nothing was
heard of the dissenter. Mrs. Jarman mar
neci again, to a man named Hali, and her
little son was reared and educated by the
devoted mother.
Youug Jaruian's life has not fallen in
particularly bright places. At ihe age of
11 he began to labor to assist support his
mother, and since then his life has been
one of unremitting, ceaseless toil. For
several years the young man was a fire
man on the Southern Pacific trains, and
later â what he considered a step in ad
vance â porter with W. P. Fuller & Co.
This position he occupied for three years,
and then came seven months of enforced
idleness. Young Jarman is now a packer
in the mail-order department of the Em
porium.
When the young man was seen yester
day alternoon by a Call representative he
confirmed the report of a father with
hiany millions, who offers him a home.
"I had not heard directly from my
father for nineteen years," said the young
man. "I knew he was prosperous and in
England ; that he had written several
novuls, among them being one entitled
â¢A Night in Hell.' But I never read any
of them. >iever had the time. I'v.i
worked since I was 11 years old, and am
>\v. Twenty-six million is a great
deal of money, and I suppose I am going
A io tind life easy now.
"Father is coming out here in January
and I am to return with him to England.
Of course 1 want my mends to know of
my good lortune, but I haven't any ready
cash yet and I owe quite a bit of money.
I was seven months out of work, and I ani
afraid my creditors will trouble me. I
have not decided what I shall do when I
iiei ;ome of that money. All I know is
I shall help mother."
And young Jarman Hal!, with the pros
pects 01 inheriting $26,000,000, is working
steadily from 8 a. m. to 10 p. m. "until
father comes."
JOHN SWETT TEAM WON.
Crockers Defeated at , Football for
Grammar School Championship.
Over a thousand feverishly excited spec
tators of the grammar school age were
gathered about the Central Park gridiron
field yesterday afternoon screeching, ges
ticulating and yelling as they watched a
closely : matched and prettily contested
game of football played for charity by the
elevens o. two of the largest grammar
schools in the Cityâ the John Swett and
'the Crocker. The Jobn Swett eleven won
after a hard struggle by a score of 10 to 6.
From the first kick-off until the linaJ
whistle it was an ci cuing exhibition of
football and showed a remarkable improve
ment i over the form and play of juve
nile teams of former years. In the se. ond
half particularly the playing was of no
mean or*der considering the age and size
of the participants and their opportuni
ties lor Earning a game of science and
skill as opposed to one of strength and
speed.
â¢ The first half closed with the Crocker
team 6 to 4 ahead, and every wearer of the
red and white demonstrative and jubilant,
even to the representation of proud moth
ers scattered among about 400 ribbon-be
decked -and unusually pretty little girls,
who formed one solid, picturesque section
in the grand stand.
In ;h'e second half the contest assumed
Â»the dash and determination of a varsity
match, and the John Swett team surged
ahead. "â¢ â  â  ;
The cool and accurate punting of Full
back Lee of the Crocker team, and his
running were admirable features of the
game, while the catcbin?, running and
line-bucking of Right Half bacs Brown of
the John Swett team were excellent. In
fact, every one played well.
As a side-line feature among the dimin
utive Brownie-like mass of eager juvenile
spectators, Vice-Principal W. D. Kines
bury of John Swett School and Police Ser
geant Michael Joseph Coboy, the guardian
angel 01 the gridiron, engaged in a vigor
011*, animated and threatening discussion
of the special privileges of school princi
pals on lootoall- fields. .
Following are the summaries of the
game and the line-up of the teams:
Points-John Swett Grammar School 10, on one

The Late "Abe Warner" and His Famous Cobweb Saloon.
[Fi-om mgatives in the fosscssioii of Nathan Joseph, 641 Clay street.}
NOW THE WEB HAS
ALL BEEN SPUN
Death of the Founder of a
Famous North Beach
Resort.
Abe Warnsr, One Tme Proprie
tor of th? "Cobwsb ialoon,"
Passes Away.
It Was Once Famous All Over the
Coast and At racted Visitors
by Thousands,
Abe Warner, one time proprietor of the
North Beach resort known as the Cobweb
saloon, died Thursday night in his cot
tage on Francisco street.
Warner was a pioneer and a prominent !
individuality of the car.ier days. He
established at Meiggs wharf in connection
with his saloon a miniature "Zjo," col
lected about him as the years went by a
quantity of old things deemed curious
from all parts of the world, allowed the
birds and monkeys to breed and the
spiders to weave their webs undisturbed, j
and all the time the fame of his shanty I
saloon grew and grew. He kept the best
of liquors and the air of age about the
place was said to add a flavor of its own.
j The clam chowder and fisb dishes to be
! had in the back room of the saloon added |
' fame to the establishment and the cobweb j
saloon became "the place to go." On
Sundays the crowds often were numbered
I by thousands, and Abe was compelled to
engage a corps of waiters and money
poured easily into the till.
But Abe was a philanthropist among
other things. At his table all who had
the slightest claim upon him weie wel
come, whether or not they coul'J pay. As
a -result the boarJ at meal times was
always full, even though the strangers and
visitors were few. 80 the money that came
to Abe in the flood of his lortune did not
remain with him. At one time he owned
considerable properly, but his holdings
dwindled away witn the turn of the tide,
lor when he ceased to make money in large
sums he did not cease to be a philan
thropist. For several years past he has I
lived upon a small stipend :-ent to him j
monthly by a daughter in the East.
The Cobweb saloon passed with the
later development of San Francisco, the ;
shifting of the centers of attraction and
the turning of the channels of trade in
other directions, albeit large and hand
some buildings stand on its site. The old
shanty was torn down several years ago,
but previous thereto the place was in
vaded by tradespeople ami thÂ»- ipidera
were roused from their winter slepp by the
Joud voice of an auctioneer. The Jast
crowd that ever gathered in the place
went to buy from tne collection of woild
gatnered oddities. One curio-dealer went
so far as to take a number of photographs
of the place just previous to its destruc
tion.
Ola Abe then moved into a shanty on
Francisco street, a block or so away from
the scene of his personal triumphs, anil
there with a few of his most beloved
birds and animals he has quietly lived and
waned for the coming of Thursday night
last and its message. Poor, he has by no
means been without friends. He has
relatives here as well as in New York, who
looked alter him and stood ready to pro
vide a better habitation for him than he
chose to occupy, but he would not move.
His daughter in the East wanted him to
come there, but he refused. He wanted to j

live among the old scenes, where, too, be
could enjoy ihe company of hi 3 pets. A
fr.voritc cockatoo died of old age a few
diys ago and Abe lelt the loss very
deeply.
Henry S. Lubbock of Oakland, formerly
boiler insppctor of this City, is a brother
in-law of Warner's ami has looked after
him considerably. He visited him on
Thursday afternoon and found him in
apparent Rood health and uromised to
come hack and talc to him further about
some of his affair* the following flay.
Shortly after Lubbock's departure, H. L.
Coy, an oi^-time friend, came in and
found the old man had just breathed his
lasi. The deceased waÂ« 82 years ol age.
Warner was born in New York ar.ct was
a bu:cher by trade. When he came to
San Francisco in 184J be started a butcher
shop on Sansome street, butshortiy closed
it out to found tiie North B-nch rpsort.
Warner left a family in New York that
never followed him. Two of bis sisters
did so, with their husbands. They are
Mrs. Lubbock and Mrs. George Coffey.
The body is at Gray's undertaking es
tablishment, from where the funeral will
proceed on Sunday at 1 o'clock to the Odd
Fellows' Cemetery.
FRIDAY NIGHT LECTURES
Rabbis Nieto and Levy Deliver
Interesting Di: courses at
Their Synagogues.
Th 3 Former Spake of Treatment of
Personal Enemies and the Latter
of J ws in Fic'ion.
Rabbi Jacob Nieto spoke on "Treatment
of Personal Enemies as Advised in the
Talmud" at the Tuylor-street Synasjague
iast night. In the course of irs lecture
he said:
"To bid a man love his enemies i 3 to rotn
tnand him to do that which he may affect
to do, Dtit which in reality it is not pos3i
ble for him to accomplish.
"The Talmud, that venerable library of
ethics and philosophy, had a full concep
tion of the manifest absurdity of layins
down principles at variance with the na
ture of man.
"The first rule of conduct toward per
sonal enemies was forbearance. The
sagos admonished their followers not to
be easily angered. To bear no maiice was
the second step, while the third was not
to seek revenge.
"According to the teachinps of the Tal
muii, the accepted basis of all Jewish
ethical ideals, it is a sin to rejoice at the
downfall of an enemy. Hebrew tradition
records that the .Egyptians were drowned
on the seventh day 01 the Easter festival,
and on that account tne Talmud enacted
th:it no songi of rejoicing should be sung
on that day, and to this day Israel never
sings a joyiul lUne on the traditional an
niversary of ihe defeat of E ypt."
Rev. M. S. Levy last night concluded
the series of lectures he began some time
ago at tiie Geary-street Temple on "The
Jew in Fiction." The subject of his dis
course was George Eliot's "Daniel Deron
da." He spoke of ttie title character as
being a hero and of Mordecai, the enthu
siast on the restoration of the kingdom of
Israel, as a high ideal.
He paid a hieh tribute to the genius of
the author, and declared that her por
trayals of the Jew and Jewess were the
only true and faithful ones, so far as race
ana religious attributes are concerned.
George Eliot neither exaggerated the vices
nor unduly extolied tUe virtues of the
Jew. Rabbi L?vy further declared that
only by a resilience amonsr the Jews and
by actually living in a Jewish family could
she have become famiiiar with tho details
of domestic life that she so graphically
and sympathetically delineated. In con
clusion he recommended ali who had not
read this last nnd greatest product of this
woman's genius to do so at the earliest
opportunity.
The manufacture of silk began in Eng
land in the year IGO3.
REGULAR TRAINS
MAY SOON RUN
Passengers to Be Carried
Over the Valley Road
to Fresno.
A Mora Convenient Service Pos
sible Than Over the Old
Monopoly.
Rates of the Pf ople's Rend Wil Make
a Saving of 37 Per
Cent.
Regular passenger service between this
City and Fresno via the Valley road and
the boats of the California Navigation and
Improvement Company may be inau
gurated next week.
So satisfactory to the two transporta
tion companies named have been the re
sults of the excursions now being con
ducted over their lines in connection with
the Fresno Citrus Fair, that the matter of
continuing tne present service as a per
manent feature is being discussed, and
there is every indication that the South
ern Pacific will shortiy have a sturdy com
petitor for the passenger business of the
San Joaquin Valley to all points as far
south as Fresno.
The experience of the past few days has
demonstrated that the roadbed is in ex
cellent condition, and the connection ar
rangements at Stockton work in a most
satisfactory manner. Should it be decided
to run regular passenger' trains, the time
schedule between Stockton and Fresno
will be the same as that now in use in
operating tho excursion trains. It is as

At tins end passengers will take the boat
at 6 r. M. and arrive at Stockton in the
morning, after a good night's rest on the
well-equipped and comfortably furnished
boats of the California Navigation and
Improvement Company. Fresno will be
readied about noon. On the trip north
war.l the train will leave Fresno shortly
after the lunch hour and arrive at Stockton
in the evening, so as to make a close con
nection with the steamer for San Fran
cisco, which leaves at 6 o'clock and arrives
I in San Francisco early the next morning.
Thus passengers will lose but halt a day
in mating the journey either way. On
the Souti.ern Pacitic the trains aie now
run so as to necessitate either the loss of
an entire day, or the uncomfortable ex
perience of arriving at or departing from
Fresno in the small hours of the morning.
But in the matter of rates the Valley
road will offer inducements that are sure
to attract traffic. As against the present
rate of $5 90 etiarged by the Soutnern Pa
cific, the Valley road will put in a rate of
$3 75, a reduction of about 37 per cent.
Meanwhile the excursion rate to Fresno
' and return has been made $3 50, tickets
j good to return until Wednesday, Decem
ber 23.
BUSIED IN A GRAY FOG.
San Francisco's Peopled Hills
Were Out of Sight as the
Sun Went Down.
Ships Hoisted Additional Lights and
Whistles and Fog Horns Played
Melancholy Music.
The first fog of the season settled down
upon San Francisco last evening as the
sun was sliding down the golden stairs
into the placid blue of the Pacific.
IÂ«. flowed in lazily, a ghostly avalanche
of gray, through the Golden Gate, envel
oping the big rifled cannon on Lime
Point, the fifteen-inch dynamite guns, the
twelve-inch riile3 and the wide-mouthed
mortars at the Presidio, Until the long
black tube? loomed ud like the stacks and
masts of wiecked steamships.
Thefog climbed Mount Olympus, steal-
I ing through the shady walks of the cypress
and eucalyptus groves on the west of the
T win Peaks. Then it rolled up past the
I Almshouse ana over the top of the Peaks,
I from wnose summits the peopled hills of
I fair San Francisco could be seen in the
twilight of the mist with smoke from
many chimneys spiraliug lazily toward
the zanith.
A few minutes later the white and gray
and veilow and red mansions of wood and
stone and brick, wiih the bay beyond
them, trie Contra Costa hills and the big
whale of brown rock th?y call Goat Inland,
were hidden in the voluminous veiling of
the fog, and there was nothiug left but a
dead sea of clouds.
Out of the smoke and mist and out of
the silence that came in with the fog there
rose at measured intervals the bellowing
of tne foghorn, the mournful mooing of a
cow for her lost calf.
Arc lights struggled hazily to be seen,
and little prismatic haloes mocked them.
The dirty yellow easjets lost whatever of
title they might " i.aye had as lights and
waned into a sickly smudge.
The usual quality of magnifying objects
was not absent. Streetcars and horses
and wagons seemed to rise out of the
ground not more than twenty feet from
the pedestrian, and each vehicle when it
first burst into view looked as big as a
two-story house.
Shipping men were unusually careful
with tueir craft, for the fog was so dense
that it was impossible to see more than a
boat's length ahead. The ferry steamers
were obliged to slacken iheir speed and to
crawl through the vapor, for fear of col
lisions. Wh sties, were repeatedly blown
and bells were rung all alons the city
front to warn traveling craft of the ob
stacles in their way.
But there were x\p grave accidents.
Neither was there ant discomfort, for ths
fog was warm and corn pan. onable and had
the glow of the Cnristmastiile upon it.
HOMES FOR BABIES.
Bazaar by Ladle* to Carry on the Work
of Mercy.
The Children's Home-finding Society's
bazaar at 420 Butter street will close to
night. Last evening, in spite ol the dis
agreeable fog, there was a good attend
ance, and the lauies in charge of the
various tables were well pleased with their
success so far.
A large vacant store near the Temple
Emanu-El was taken for the occasion and
handsomely decorated with red p.nd white
bunting and some evergreens. The ladies
of the society soon transformed the big
interior into an attractive bazaar. The
result is that the tables are covered with
all kinds of pretty articles suitable for
Christmas presents. There is also a col
lection of water-color sketches and pic
tures of different kinds for sale.
In all there are nine booths, as follows:
Domestic booth, Mrs. Young; fancy
booth, Miss Hoffman, Miss Kelly; doll
booth, Miss Fossy and assistants; art
booth, Mrs. Benton, Mrs. Sandehl; art
gallery, Miss Rumsey; table of fortune,
Miss Batler; grabbag. Miss Benton; re
freshments. Airs. Lloyd, Mrs. Badiey, Mrs.
Grimm, Mrs. Canwrigat ; palmistry, Pro
fespor Rekaf.
The feature of this afternoon will be an
exhibition of the modern ark. This is
merely a 10-cent market basket, but it will
contain one of the helpless infants for
Whom the Children's Home-tinJing Soc
ety rinds homes. The etiild will be on ex
hibition on its way to its new home, and
will hold its reception from '2 to 5 p. m.
Children will be admitted free of charce,
but are asked not to forget ?ome donation.
The bazaar will be open all day and
evening. In addition to the little one
that is to leave on the 5 p. m. train for its
home 150 miles away, a stui later home
less infant will entertain the visitors after
ward. It is but 14 day 8 old, and so far
sorrow and tears have been it-j portion,
and the ladies wish to know who will help
it with some of the good things of life to
make the little stranger happy.

JUGGLED WITH
TITLE ABSTRACTS
Farmer Robinson Told the
Grand Jury How H3
Was Beguiled.
Came Out Fifteen Hundred Dol
lars Short in a Land Trans
action.
An Unexpected Trust Deed Held by
the San Francisco Savings Union
to S cure $2000
G. \V. Robinson told the Grand Jury
yesterday that be was swindled out of
$1500 in cash. The jury was deeply im
pressed by tha narrative, as many of the
facts were corroborated by J. F. Cuuning
ham, wholesale grocer, 14 Clay street, San
Francisco.
According to the story told to the Grand
Jury Mr. Kobinson in Octobar last met
G. W. Donaldson, residing on Sanchez
street, in this City. Donaldson presented
the advantages and described the location
of a 200-acre tract ql land near P.eyto,
Monterey County. Mr. Robinson . went
down and saw the land and the prospect
pleased him. Then Donaldson went up
to Mendocino County and saw the little
farm at Elk. An exchange was soon agreed
upon. A valuation of $2000 was placed on
the Mendocino land, house, barn and hay.
The Monterey land was held to De worth
$3500, and Robinson was to pay tho dif
ference, $1500.
When abstracts of title were examined
Mr. Cunningham advised his friend, Rob
inson, that a lawyer should be engaged to
examine the titie, but the confiding Men
docino County farmer had so much faith
in George W. Donaldson of this City ana
W. C. and John Donaldson of Monterey
County that he concluded not to spend
money for examination of papers. Mr. Cun
ningham himself examined the abstract
carefully, and it seeuied to him clear and
straight.
The transactions of exchange were duly
executed October 10, before Notary En
quist, in the Milis building, and Mr. Rob
iuson paid over his $1500 to G. W. Donald
son In due time the Mendocino farmer
went to Monterey and took possession of
his farm, for which he had paid the sum
of his worldly lortune.
He explained to the Grand Jury how
rudely he was shaken when the knowl
edge came to him that the San Francisco
Savings Union held a deed of trust on the
land to secure the payment of $2000, which
G. W. Donald; on hati borrowed from tne
bank in December, 1880. Mr. Robinson
told the jury that he was assured there
was nothing due on the land but the taxes
for the current year. He stated that the
abstract which ue examined and showed
to Cunningham contained no mention of
the trust deed. In this respect his testi
mony was corroborated by the wholesale
grocer, J. F. Cunningham, who said he
carefully read the abstract.

In a recent interview Senator Quay said:

tent and application of this remark, you
have only to apply to John Wanamaker.
A CONVICTED FALSIFIER, FRAUD AND FAKER.
The Examiner has been evidently hard hit by the comments of the press of Califor
nia upon it and by the expressed contempt in which it is held by decent people. Like
an indicted mountebank it is endeavoring to escape the consequences of
its arrest and arraignment by means of the most transparent falsehoods and
fakes. In addition to its already overworked every-day liar it has called its affidavit
malcer to the aid of its "Long Green" manager with an alleged statement of tne
Examiner's "distribution." The last time this useful member of the Examiner's
"Fake and Fiction" department came to its rescue ho speedily retired from the
scene of conflict a badly battered person and with very little left of his affidavit besides
the notary's seal.
The "Long Green" manager of the Examiner is displaying some present discretion
in seeking to hide himself behind the person of his affidavit-maker, but his thought
ful cowardice comes too late. The affidavit-maker is no longer of either offensive or
defensive utility, for the simple reason that the Examiner has become entirely too
offensive to be defended. Tbe best evidence of this is to be found in the
fact that even its literary gun-fighter and the bodyguard of its "Long Green" manager
has deemed it due to the shreds and patches which remain of his reputation to
deny in open court and under oath that be is an employe of the Examiner, or that
he has recently allowed his literary gems to sparkle, among the rubbish and refuse
with which its columns are filled. It is a matter of some argument about
town as to which Mr. Earp considers most disreputable, to be the bodyguard ot a
blackguard or the sp cia. writer of the newspaper of which that sort of person has
been appropriately made manager. Apparently the bad man from Arizona has con
cluded that it is less dishonorable to bunko a prize-tight than to bo either, and that
having cleaned up an income from his latest venture he may escape the greater disre
pute of his earlier employment by getting out of town.
The "Lone Green" manager of the Examiner must be credited with a marked
degree of versatility in the methods which he has recently adopted to convince the
public of the Examiner's utter unreliability and disrepute. Beginning with an attempt
to reproduce in the Examiner the vigorous English in which the decent newspapers
of tbe Pacific Coast expressed their estimate of its indecency and unworth,
he soon found that a continuance of such publication would not only occupy the entire
issue but would call for a very large extra edition daily. He therefore turned his versatile
mind to other means of showing and increasing the Examiner's ill repute. He has
adopted the comparative method and makes a daily display of the efforts of his three
principal assistants, making the reading public discredit whatever the Examiner says
or does.
These three able and congenial aids to "Long Green" are the plain, ordinary,
every-day faker, who is a member of the regular staxf, the special writer of follies and
falsehoods who dees space, and last, but by no means least, the affidavit maker. It
has not be n the usual thing for the Examiner to employ all of these talented assistants
at tbe same time, or cublish their output upon the same day; but of late they have
all three been occupied to the point of overwork. In consequence thereof the Exam
iner's effort to prove itself entirely unworthy of all confidence is
reining on famously. The serious question at present agitating the
public mind is whether its "Long Green" manager will succeed in
mnking the Examiner thoroughly disreputable- before Mr. Hearst awakens
to a realization of the fact that there are better ways of making it a popular news
paper than those which the license he has given "Long Green" to run it has enabled
him to emnioy. Whenever such awakening comes a blackguard and his bodyguard
will probably be united in some other region where there is no ordinance against
carrying concealed weapons, and where the methods of both are better suited to the
society of that romantic frontier.
SAN FRANCISCO AND PRESTO.
The excursion of San Francisco mer
chants to Fresno is to be something more
than a pleasure trip, though the pleasure
which they will derive from the hospitality
of Fresno and from the delights of the
citrus fair will be great. It will be an
evidence of the interest which the pro
gressive men of San Francisco take in the
work of progressive men in other parts of
tbe State, and will tend not only to a
better feeling between the City and the
interior, but to the development of busi
ness relations.
Tbe council of associated industries in
adopting resolutions accepting the invi
tation to visdt the fair expressed the gen
eral sentiment in declaring "We believe
that all opportunities should be improved
to stimulate and encourage tbe better
feeling and more cordial relations between
the people of the interior and those of the
metropolis and that a closer intermingling
;s calculated to. promote this result. 1 '
The fair at Fresno is in every respect an
important accomplishment tor the whole
State as well as for the San Joaquin. It
ha- made evident the iact that Fresno is
something more than the center of a
raisin producing country. It has shown
:o the world that the great San Joaquin
Valley is a region of the most diversified
resources and produces in abundance a
iarge variety of the rinest fruits, grains,
wines, vegetables and woods known to
San Francisco, as the metropolis of
California, is charged with the responsi
bility of making these products known
abroad, and her merchants work for her
own interests as well as for the interests
of Fre.sno and the interior when they
take step 1 ? to acquaint themselves with
the productions of the San Joaquin in or
der that they may more effectually find
markets for them in the East and in Eu
rope,
The business men of Fresno have
worked hard to make the fair a notable
success and have achieved a triumph they
may well be proud of. All reports show
that the extent and the variety of the ex
hibits has been a surprise to many people
in Fresno its'lf. Certainly there aie
thou-ancls of Caiifornians in other por
tions of the State who did not know how
great is the wealth-rroducing capability
of the San Joaquiu. They have now had
an object-lesson which convinces even the
most skeptical of the vast resources of our
great interior valley and its surrounding
foothills. It is gratifying to know that
the merchants of San Francisco will be
among tho3e who Bee this object-lesson
and study it with care. The trip to Fresno
is a holiday full of business possibilities,
and there can be little doubt that many of
these will be realized in the near future.
THE IMMIGRATION BILL.
The irn migration bill passed by the Sen
ate, while not as stringent as was desired
by a considerable cJass of people, is yet in
its main lines in accordance with the pre
vailing sentiment on the subject. It has
been the general desire that in imposing
further restrictions upon immigration to
this country, the fundamental principle
should be thai of excluding the ignora.n
by requiring of every immigrant an edu
cational test and this is the main object of
the bill.
The proposed law provides that in addi
tion to all persons excluded under the re
strictions of the existing act there shall
be barred irom admission to the United
Stales all persons over 16 years of age who
cannot read and write the language of
their native country or seme other lan
guage. It is permissible, however, for an
admissible immigrant over 16 to bring
with him or send for his wife, parents or
children, notwithstanding their inability
to read and write. A further provision of
the act exempts from its operation all per
sons arriving in the" United States from
Cuba during the continuance of the dis
orders there, provided such persons have
been inhabitants of the island.
Tba demand for an educational test for
the admission of immigrants to tne United
States is well founded. For a long time
the bulk of foreign immigration to this
country came from Great Britain, France,
Germany and Scandinavia, and the ma
jority of persons included in that immi
gration were fairly well educated and well
fatted for American citizenship. In recent
year?, however, there has been a great
change in this respect. The bulk of our
immigration of late has been from South
ern and Eastern Europe and has been
largely compo-ed of persons too ignorant
Jo understand our system of government
or to become good citizens.
During the fiscal year ending last June
the number of immigrants from Great
Britain, France, Germany and Scandina
via amounted to about 132,000. while that
from Southern and Eastern Europe was
179,000. Among the Italians over 14 years
of age 55 per cent were illiterate, among
the llu-sums 41 per cent, and among
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 19, 1896.
those from Austro-Hungary 39 per cent.
It is also to be noted that comparatively
few among those from the south and east
of Europe had any skill in any kind of
:rade.
The results of this immigration of
ignorant and unskilled labor is to
be found in the slums of our great
cities. According to a report of the
Commissioner of Labor, made in 1894,
in Baltimore 77 per cent of the total
population in the slums was of foreign
birth or parentage; in Chicago, 90 per
cent; in Philadelphia, 91 per cent, and in
New York 95 per cent. In Baltimore, out
of every 100 aliens in the slums 40 were
illiterate; in Chicago, 47; in New York,
59, and in Philadelphia, 51; and out of
every 100 of these illiterate aliens 67
were of voting age in Baltimore,*77 in
Chicago, 78 in New York and 85 in Phila
delphia.
The prompt passage of the new restric
tion act is the more important because
the tide of immigration to t is country,
which had railen off during the years of
depression, has begun to flow in upon us
ai;ain with something like its old force.
With the revival of indu-ary and the com
ing of better times, there will be a large
increase in immigration if it were not in
some measure excluded. This will be
(ione by the educational test pro
posed by the act. When we shut
out all who cannot read aud write we will
bar a larpe majority of those who come to
us from countries where labor has been
degraded to a condition that renders their
people unfitted for American citizenship
and unfair competitors with American
workingmen.
"THE SUNDAY CALL."
To-morrow's issue of The Call will fully
sustain the splendid reputat on it pos
si s'es as a valuable and entertaining
iriend of the family and a welcome Sun
day visitor.
"The Foundation Stone of San Fran
cisco's Greatness" is an article that will
command wide attention ami deep inter
est among all who are concerned in the
advancement, and prosperity of the metrop
olis of the Pacific Coast. This is to be the
colossal entrepot of the Occidental trade.
"The shin ng rails of steel may come
and kiss the dancing waves of the golden
ocean," says the writer. "But there the
poetry ends and the very plain prose be
gins. Between the rails and the waves
there must be a big strong bridge, over
which the commerce of the rails and
waves will have to pass, and that bridge
is what is called a commercial seaport.
"That San Francisco will become the
greatest seanort of the world is a problem
that can only be delayed of affirmative
solution by the exercise of the blindest
disregard of business principles, a con
dition which is not now nor very likely
to be found in the city which eraces the
finest harbor in the world, having oppo
site to its mouth three-fifths of ail the
world's commerce."
The commercial, mercantile and other
representative interests should pay heed
to the timely suggestions in this able ar
ticle, which will benefit San Francisco far
and near.
'The Strangest of Latter-day Ciusades"
will be somewhat of a revelation to our
preachers and to peopie of all our
churches; for it gives risÂ« to the query,
"Is a revolution in religions a probability
in the near future?"
A number of capital Christmas sketches
make features that will amuse and delight.
A pleasant little story of how a local
operetta came to be born will afford good
reaHing. It contains a few snatches of
verse that have a bearing which will be
generally appreciated.
An account of a Southern California
man's adventures with an aerial veloci
pede makes an excellent story.
There are dozens of fine features in ad
dition, and besides all these the various
departments are stocked with good things.
The children's page will be hailed witn
by the little folks, as it will be
radiant with Christmas gems. The whole
paper will be one of rich interest, and one
that should be in every home.
PRESIDENTS SONS.
Moses P. Handy in Chicago Times-Herald.
Within the week I have seen six sons of as
manj ex- Presidentsâ Kobert Lincoln, Colonel
Fred Grant, James A. Garfield Jr., Chester
Allan Arthur Jr. and Russell Harrison. Young
Gurfteld I heard speak at the Hanna bunquet
At Cleveland, and I doubt whether his father,
gifted orator as he was, could have made a
beiter speech at the same age. It was not
simply that his phrasing was good and his de
livery agreeable, but that he expressed good
ideas cast in the niola of his own mind. He is
a young man with an assured political future.
Colonel Grant has been at Canton and Cleve
land a good deal lately, but his friendship
with the McKinleys is not a uew thing, and lie
never goes through Cleveland without spend
ing a night at the hospitable home of Sylvester
T. Everett, who is an old friend of his as well
as of Major McKinley. These visits have
naught to do with colonel Grant's frankly ex
pressed amtiition ;o bo Secretary of War. To
hold that place has been his ambition for
years, and it is an ambition within the lines of
his tastes and capacity. A soldier Dy birth
ana education, trained at the feet of the great
est general ot the day, he is eminently quali
fied for the Dosition. Like all the Grants, and
especially like his father, whom he resembles
more every day, he has matured slowly but
surely. While he wns Minister to Austria I
had occasion to see how modestly and abiy he
discharged his<lutie3. There may be political
reason* why he should not be Secretary of
War, but there are none other.

THE CALL'S COURSE APPROVED.
Sisson llirror. ,
The San Francesco Call has recently departed from its established course oJ seeK
ing to exemplify the merits of decent journalism without disapproving attacks^upon
the degrading tenuenciss of some contemporaries. Naturally enough t.ie depar lure
takes the form of a severe rebuke to an opposition daily, tne Examiner, inee
of the Mirror have watched Brother Sliortri-lge's success with The Call from tne : urn

dulled by indications of jealousy, but instead have been apparently the performance
of unwelcome duty as a redeemer of journalistic virtue. i.j..v-,Â«Hn*
It needs no argument by its contemporary to prove the unreliable, b ackma limr,
degrading character of the "Examiner, but it may be this b!ot upon We t 9tern . Jo"'^?,.J o "'^?,.
ism may be effaced or stained over through the efforts of The Call to echo public
opinion'against the sensational vilifying press. The venturÂ» is fraught \vitn many
unpleasant obstructions, chief among which is voiced in the o,d saying, me more
the carrion is disturbed the greater the stench," and Mr. Shortndge need not oe
surprised if he discovers that the Examiner's capacity for meanness has never yei
been fully measured. x . . ' . â__
If the crusade of The Call is pursued with vigor and courage the interior â press
of California, including the Mirror, will earnestly approve its course, and it is nopea
the good taste of the thousands of patrons of San Francisco dailies in California w m
mold a public opinion upon which it will be safe for The Call to rely, bucu a r p suu
would certainly reclaim much of tbe civic prestige lost by California and gain ior
Charles M. Shortridpe the distinctive recognition which we believe he deserves as a
reputable and conscientious managing editor of a morning daily in the vuckea
city of the West."
DOING THE WORK IN A MASTERLY MANNER.
Nevada City Transcript.
The Call is now engaged in the pleasing pastime of excoriating the Examiner, and
it is doing the work in a masterly manner. The poor idiotic Examiner imagined that
it could vilify any one it saw fit, and there would be no back talk. It was mistaken
for once, at least, and The Call is giving it some of its own medicine, and public sen
timent is with The Call. The Call is telling ihe truth on the dirty Examiner, whose
circulation will soon only De equal to tbe number of bawdy houses on the coast, ihe
Call should keep up the good work, with a view of driving the pusillanimous Examiner
out of the field of journalism.
SHOULD BE CONDEMNED BY HONEST READERS.
Palo Alto Times.
The Examiner's attack upon The Call and the Shortridges should be condemned
by every honest newspaper reader. To so far forget its professional dignity as to put
forth such depraved personalities) as the Examiner has been doing; tne past few weeks
cannot but tend to shake the confidence of the public in thatself-styled "Monarch.
AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
Joseph Craig, who used to practice law in
Yolo County, but who for iour years past has
been proprietor of the hotel at Highland
Springs, Lake County, has been in town for
the last day or two and is at the Grand.
Mr. Craig says there have been a great many
tourists at the springs this year. The main
hotel was enlarged by a tront of an additional
150 feet, but that is not enough. It is the pur
pose to add forty or fifty rooms for next season.
"I do not suppose there is another country
in the world or a place of equal size that hag
such a wonderful number ot springs," said Mr.
Craig, >- as Lake County. Everything that can
be thou?ht of is there. Then a great many of
these springs are giving off gas all the time, so
that the air is about as good as the water for
health.
"Take it at Highland Springs, there are
thirty different springs there . with water
from 82 down. Almost any kind of water
JOSEPH CRAIG. One of the Many Hotel
Men of Lake County.
[Sketched from lijc by a " Call " artist.]
that can be thought of is to be had In the
county. There are boiling springs â these of
arsenic, iron, soda, sulphur and everything
conceivable.
"If you take the stage fiom Pieta, on the
railroad, you have but a twelve-mile ride be
fore the Highland Springs ure reached. There
you have mountains on one side and a valley
on the other. Eight miles away is Lnkeport,
on Clear Lake, one of the most beautiful
bodies of water to be found anywhere.
"One reason though that many people like
Lake County is that they get away from rail
roads and off where they can enjoy nature un
trammeltd by the restrictions which steam
and electricity would brine.
"We had a rush of tourists this year, and I
expect many more during the coming season."
Mr. Craig is here on a business trip, and will
soon return.
SUITS FOR BOYS
The jackets of this season have a feature
which will recommend itself to any woman
attempting to make boys' jackets, and that is
the patch pockets, which are made of the ma
terial and fastened with button flap. The but
ton can be either of bone or made of the cloth
of jacket covered over a moid. The four-but-
ton sack coat is the best accepted style for
general wear. The mixed cheviots, cassimere
and homespuns make up well, and for best
suits the same style is followed, though the
fabric is usually a smooth-faced cloth or a dark
diagonal.
The coat buttons moderately high, and
the sleeves should be finished with two or
three buttons at the cuff. Boys' coats are
easier to make than many mothers imagine,
if the cloth is not too heavy. The pressing
and neatly stitched finish are the most diffi
cult points for the home dressmaker.
Whole suits oi the same goods are the best
style, and it is advisable to make or purchase
an extra pair of trousers to every suit, espe
cially for the youngest boy.

Letters From the People*
EQUAL SUFFRAGE IN FACT.
How the Women of Henver Exercised
Their Xetely Acquired JCiylit
to Vote.
To the Editor of the Call â Sir: Will you
kindly present to your readers the inclosed
extract from an article by Mrs. Clara B. Colby,
editor Woman's Tribune. Washington, D. C,
who went to Denver last mouth on purpose to
observe the voting of women.
Ida A. Harper.
The extract referred to in the above com
munication is as follows:
The voting of our party over, we hurried
back, and then an opportunity was provided
lor the domestics to tuke their turn. My
iriend has' always personally managed every
detail ior the comfort of her large household,
and felt she had enough to do without taking
part in politics. Now, however, she votes,
because she considers it her duty, and she
does it with the same cousciencious zeal tnat
cuamcterizes all her actions, aud withal she
seemed to enjoy it.
After the wiieeis of household affairs were
set going for the day we went to various poll
ing places; not to all, tor there were over 100
iv the cuy, but certainly to more than half
that number. At almost all there were women
to be seen inside and going and coming. In
one a neighbor held a baby while its mother
voted. There was occasionally a woman judge
or inspector. At an appointed time my friend
gave up her carriage to the use oi a sick lady,
who was determined to get up from her bed to
go' to the polls, and, helped by three of her
triends, she made the effort without being
injured. Other instances of women prizing
their vote came to my notice afterward. On
the train leaving Denver, aiter the election, I
heard women talking about having delayed
tneir departure in order to vote.
One snid her husband was then employed in
Minnesota. He hud sent her a ticket to join
him which would compel hur to leave Denver
Monday night beiore election. But she went
to the agent and told him he must telegraph
and get the time extended, for she would for
feit her ticket rather than lo.se her chance to
vote. In District D, one of the most aristo
cratic of Capitoi Hill, 571 women registered
and 570 voted, and iv the proportion of two
women to one man. I met a great many
women during the day and evei.ing, and I
only found one who had notvoiei); and she
deeply regretted her failure to register aud j
consequt-m Ineligibility.
1 saw no disorder or disturbance of any |
kind, although we were ct.reful to drive i
through the worst parts ot the city. The
polling-places in these parts were as quiet and j
respectable looking as any other.
The city was much quieter than on ordin
ary business day*, as nuaiy of the firms closed
part of the day, and tneir employes went to j
their suburban homes to vole. Country ti attic I
ami thiTrailroad travel were very light. Every- i
body staved in his own place to vote, aud
Denver, the bustling metropolis of the Rockies,
wore almost k Sunday espect. It wou.d re
quire the magic of Aladdin's iamp to conjure
up anything disagreeable or injurious as lie
compiiuyi'.ig or arising Irom the voting of
women in Colorado, and me testimony of I
thoso who hMve been able to compare elections
before and since proves that much of the pres
ent good order is the result of their voting,
aud of the good regulations which have been
made in view oi iheir presence at the po. ls.
So much, at least, there has been of diiect gain
to the community. Then there has been an
immense gain to women theime.ves.
Their leading women nave ceased to be pre
eminently society women, and have become
conscious of their citizenship, with all its obli
ptttioiis. The Woman's Club numbers over
GOO, and its conduct is systematic, par.iamen
tary, considers. c and diguifjed. The mem
bers are becoming strong and self-poised.
They look on life with a broader outlook.
The legal department of the club spent the
whole of last sea-on in studying three bills
which they wished presented to the Legisla
ture, and the manner in which they made
themselves masters of the provisions of tne*
bills a,nd their possible outcome led ihe Cham
ber of Commerce to request .hern to take up
a proposed new city charter for consideration.
Not only this, but a cnarter prepared in the
'University ol Denver for the students has
Lieen scut to tne club ior study.
Surely a condition which stimulates women
to take an interest in all matters pertaining
to good government, ana which wins for tnem
the rt-spectful attention of the best men as
valued coadjutors, must be for the benefit of
any community.
ALASKA'S BOUNDARY LINE.
New York Tribune.
After the Venezuelan boundary is carefully
riveted down so that it will stay in one place,
it will be time to mark out the Alaskan line so
that the British official can see it without spec
tacles. At present he comes across it wnere
there are any valuable mineral deposits, and
levies a tax upon our miners before h- will
allow them to pick up the gold which tiea
around on their own territory. It is obvious
enough thrt the frontier, in spots, aÂ». Im.st,
requires a more visible and precise definition
tlmu the Boundary Commission hai given it.
We have as yet Â«<> occasion to join the wolfs
long howl on Oonalaska's shore In resentmsat
of anything which our neighbors have dma,
anu probably will not have, but the line ousjht W
to be bl'zei anew wlitn it runs through" 1 or *

The British Bark Dalrymple and the American Bark S. C Alien Both Made the Bar Last Sunday. The Former "Was in Tow,
but the Hawser Parted, and the Captain Put to Sea Again. The Allen Was Flying Light, but by Pouring Oil
From the Main Rigging Captain Thompson Managed to Bring His Vessel In Without Shipping an Ounce of
Water. The Dalrymple Got In Yesterday in Tow of the Reliance.
POURING OIL ON
TROUBLED WATERS
The Experience of Captain
Thompson on a Break
ing Bar.
The Bark S. C. Allen Came in
S" afely While the Dalrymp'e
Put to Sea.
Oil Poured From the Main R gging of
the Bark Prevented the Waves
From Breaking Aboard.
There was oil poured on the troubled
waters last Sunday and in consequence
the bar off the Golden Gate when breaking
wa3 robbed of its terror for one ship at
least. One vessel struck on a reef in the
north channel. The second parted the
hawser she had attached to a tug and had
to make sail and stand out to sea, but the
thir i used oil on the breakers and sailed
in unaided.
The British ship Gentesima, in tow of
the Reliance, was the vessel that came in
through the north channel, and the bark
Dalrymple was in tow. of the Sea Witch.
The hawser could not stand the strain,
and when it parted the Dalrymple was
headed out for sea again. Last Thursday
the Reliance picked her up and towed her
into por. The S. C. Allen was coming in
from Honolulu, and when Captain Thomp
son saw the state of the bar he at once or
dered two men witn oiloags into the main
rigging. All around the bark the waves
were rolling mountain high and every one
was a breaker. When the oil was poured
in a continuous stream overboard the
waves riat'eued down in a great measure
and the break disappeared. Over twenty
gallons of oil was poured over the sides of
the vessel and in consequence the Allen
came in with dry decks. The Centesima
and Dalrymple were under water half the
time and both of the captains say they
never saw a worse bar. The Allen was
flying light, and yet with the aid of oil
she sailed in and made good time.
Captain Thompson will not go out on
the Allen again and his pUce has been
taken by Captain Johnson, late chief offi
cer of the vessel, 'ihe former will take
the steamer Scray, now being built for tue
Inter-Island bteam Navigation Company,
to Honolulu, and on his arrival there will
as-ume command of the fine iron bark R.
P. Rithet.
The little ferry steamer El Capitan is
back again on the iiarrow-gauge route
and the Encinal Ik once more laid
up for repairs. Thursday last the big boat
was caught by the wind and tide and
thrown so hard against the slip that her
breast beam broke. It will take nearly
a week to put in a new one and in the
meantime pas engera to and from Ala
meda will have to put up with the crowd
ing that occurs at certain hours of tlie day
on the smaller boat.
The captains and pilots of San Fran
cisco have a grievance. Thry complain
that men without licens s are allowed to
bring vessels in from sea and take them
up tho r.ver. Further they assert that
many well-known skippers and first offi
cers are either color blind or sdortsich ed,
and then point to the fact that while in
the East every master mariner has to sub
mit to an eyesight test, here nothing is
done in that line. "Color-blindness and
short sight have been responsible for a
great many wrecks that bave occurred re
cently," said one of the captains yester
day. "In one instance I know positively
t: at the mate was nearsighted, and prob
ably the loss of the vessel will be placed
on him. It is time the insurance com
panies made some move in the matter, as
they are the parties most interested."
The election of McKinley and the con
sequent protection tc American indus
tries has begun to maice itself lelt already.
Wool will almost certainly be taxed, and
merchants in the East are hastening to
get all of the article they can from Aus
tralia before Cleveland stens down and
out. The steamer Manposa brought a
very large consignment, all for Boston,
and every steamer that leaves Sydney
during the next three months will bring
big shipments. By bringing the wool in
now the merchants will save whatever tax
may be placed on it later on.
AH the steam whalers in Oakland Creek
are being got ready for next season's
cruise. Several changes among the cap

go out next March as master of the Kar
luk. Captain Sherman, the father of the
only white child ever born off the mouth
of the McKenzie River, will go out on the
Orca, and the chauces are that Captain
Williams will take the Beluga. Just what
will be done with the Baelena remains to
be seen. If she is laid up for the season,
however, nobody will be surprised.
Captain Fred Nelson will bring the
Rattler over from Oakland Creek in a
few days and will fit her out for a sealing
cruise on the coast, after which he will
make for Japan. Nelson is one of the
most expert hunters in California and he
almost invariably brings back a good
catch.
Captain Gus Schlehan left last night for
Tacoma to join the Chilean bark Lake
Leman as first officer. The vessel is ready
to sail for Chile and only awaits the
arrival of Schlehan in order to start on
the voyage. The captain has been
specially engaged and will receive a better
salary than any chief officer on the Pacific
Coast.
No attempt will be made to get the
steam schooner Bessie X off the south
spit in Coquilie River this winter. She is
in a sale piare and no damage can come
to her. After the storms are over she will
be hauled off and once more put in com
mission. The crew will be brought to San
Francisco and paid off, and in future the
Bessie X will be in charge of a watchman.
Kentneld it Co. have latterly been
dumping rubbish into an open space on

retaining wall to keep the rubbish from
drifting into the bay and they assert that
the Commissioners in consequence have
no jurisdiction.
The steam schooner Point Arena from

also behind time, but she probably has
been delayed from the same cause. The

The British ship captains are preparing
for a great celebration at Sausalito to-day.
There will be a regatta and a sociai on

A Victory for the Sailura.
District Judge Morrow rendered an inter
esting decision yesterday in the case of Wil
liam Hogau and others against the bark J. D.
Peters and her master. Captain J. M. J!aÂ»kcl:.
The libelnnts were sailors who fh.ppea at
Port Towusend for a trip to Alaska and back to
San Francisco. Tne sailors claimed that aside
from the goods furnished by the ship out of
tue slop chest tnoy wore entitled to wages
aggregating $783 20, notwithstanding their
allotment of .f25 per man. which their utior
ney said was illegal under the act of 1895
known as the Macuire act.
Judge Morrow holds differently and that
allotments are different from advancements,
which are illegal. He decided that the nine
sailors were entitled to a lump sum of $558 20
besides their allotments already secured.
Judge Morrow rttled that the sailors had been
overcharged by the captain for their allot
ment^, goods taken from the slop chest, and
said that in many instances the captain over
charged from 300 to 400 per cent His de
cision was virtually a victory for the sailors.

GRAND JURY GETS
TOO MUCH JOHNSON
Two of That Name Cause
a Complication in Its
Warrants.
Apprised of the Facts by the
Judiciary Committee of the
Supervisors.
Hints Dropped That Bogus Assign*
ments by the Job Lot H ive Been
Made to Brokers.
William Johnson of the Mission roared.
The roar was caused by the discovery that
another William Johnson had signed his
name to a warrant of $54 for jury fees.
What made the roar ioud and prolonged
was tne further discovery that payment of
the sum called for in the warrant had
been assigned to M. M. G. Harding. The
roar made a sensation at the City Hall late
yesterday afternoon and so frigntened the'
Judiciary Committee Of Supervisors that
the signing of warrants was suspended,
iti looking over his accounts John A.
Russell, clerk of the board, found that
$21,000 had been disbursed since last
August in payment of jury fees.
The Judiciary Committee and the clerk
of the board deemed it wise to apprise
the Grand Jury of the irregularity, inas
much as Johnson had made the statement
that his case was only one of a dozen of a
similar nature.
Frederick K. Hobbs of the Grand Jury
detailed William L. Ashe, Rob rt Haight,
E. P. Farnswortli and Harry W. Goodail
to visit the Judiciary Committee. The
jurors returned and alter consultation a
message was sent to Chief Crowley asking
that a detective be sent to the Grand Jury.
Detective Eagan was advised to report to
Messrs. Goodail and Farnsworth.
After receiving instructions from the
jurors the detective went to John A. Rus
sell and obtained the facts concerning the
warrant irregularity. He also obtained
the warrant in favor of William Johnson,
giving a receipt to the clerk thereior.
The Grand Jury to-day will heai Detective
Eaeran's report.
Mr. Russell was not alarmed by the
statements made by Johnson, and neither
is he convinced that wholesale frauds
have been committed in the signing of
naroes, transferring warrants to brokers
for collection. Yet he deemed it wise to
suspend operations for the present. John
son s assertion that his own experience
was that of a dozen others was somewhat
surprising and suggested an investiga
tion. The warrants :or jury services come
from the County Clerk's office and are re
turned to that office when approved by
the Board of Supervisors.
Harry Piper, chief deputy in the County
Clerk's office, was interviewed for The
Cail after the matter had been placed in
the hands of Defective Eagan. He said
the Supreme Court decision ot last August
upholding the fee bill of 1895 caused a
swarm of brokers to come forth. Men

| who had served on the jury as far back as
I last March were traced out from the court
records. For examDle, a juror who had
served twenty days would be offered $20
tor his claim." To many tnis offer was like
finding so much money, as they did not
know that any amount was due them.
An assignment in the presence of a notary
was readily male and the broker collected
the money. The amount allowed for
twenty days is $40.
Mr. Piper explained that the system
which had been established in the County
Clerk's office was a sure check against
double payment and against payment to
any person who had not performed jury
service. "This case," said Mr. Piper,
"which is now being investigated by the
Judiciary Committee and the Grand Jury,
is easily explained. There are two William
Johnsons. One lives at the Mission and
the other is in business down on Market
street. Thr Johnson on Market street got
the warrant which belongs to Johnson of
the Mission, and assigned payment to M.
M. G. Harding. I have made a memoran
dum to hold the warrant, and have sent
for Harding and both of the Johnsons.
"You would be surprised," said Mr.
Piper, "at the number oi brokers engaeed
in this business. In the $21,000 disbursed
I do not think any of the money has been
paid out to persons who were not entitled
to receive it." ,
Mr. .Piper went with the reporter to one
of the courtrooms to explain the system
followed by the courtroom clerks. For
example, if a juror in June bad served
twenty clays in the court of which Oscar
Tolle is clerk that juror goes to Mr. Tolle
and asks for his time. Mr. Tolle gives
him a slip of paper on which is written
the number ol days of jury service per
formed, and designates each day of'the
month in which jury duty was performed
by the applicant.
This slip of paper is taken to the
chief clerk, who enters the record in the |
warrant-bock. The warrants are then
made out and approved by the County
Clerk and sent to the Board of Super
visors. The warrant stub also shows the
amount, the name and the number. When
approved by the Supervisors the warrants
come back to the County Clerk. When
the warrant is finally delivered a receipt
is taken from the person in who>e favor it
is drawn or from the broker to whom it is
assigned.
Before this system was established
brokers had blank warrants printed and
assignments executed before a notary. The
Grand Jury may be able to improve the
system of certifying the number of days
which the juror served. The time certi
ficate should be signed by the Judge on
the bench as well 83 by'the clerk of the
court.
AFTER THE NEW MAP.
Members of the Grand Jury tailed
Upon the SuperviÂ«ors in Kegard
to the Matter.
The Judiciary Committee of the Board
of Supervisors received a call yesterday
from M^ssrs.Haieht and Farnswortli of the
Grand Jury in reference io the new City
map, which the jury recommended that
the board refuse to accept. The jurymen
were inquisitive about certain streets that
had been expunged from the map and
other particulars about which they had
found fault.
City and County Attorney Creswell was
present to explain any legal points that
might not be clear to MesÃrs. Farnsworth
and Haight and after a couple of hours'
talk they left apparently satisfied with
the explanations given.
A Maniac's Leap
Lee Ching, an insnne Chinaman, took off his
clothe- an 4 jumped irom the upper window

He w: s taken to the Receiving Hospital, where
he was found to be suffering so severly from
concussion ot the brain and spine that he can
not live.
FELL SIXTY FEET
TO HIS DEATH
A. F. Braun, a Carpenter,
Knocked From the
Ferry Depot.
He Was Struck by the Swing
ing of a Large Derrick
Bcom.
Scarcely a Bone in His Body Was
Who!e After Striking the Rock
Foundation.
Alonzo F. Braun, foreman of the car
penters employed on the new ferry build
ing at the foot of Market street, met
with a shocking deatli yesterday morn
ing. He fell from a high girder a distance
of sixty feet from the foundation, and
when ha struck his skull was burst open.
In his fall the unfortunate man hit the
iron girders and floor beams of two floors,
and scarcely a bone in his body escaped
whole. He died before reaching the Re
ceiving Hospital, and the wonder is that
he lived as long as he did.
On the north wing of the depot the iron
frame work has been completed for several
days, and a number of carpenters were set
to work to build a tramway for cars to
carry material to the masons. On the
end of this a large derrick was erected to
hoist the stone to the roof.
Here it was that Braun, familiarly
known as Brown, was standing. He was
fastening the guyrope of a swinging boom
to the derrick.
In some manner that no one seemed to
be able to explain the rope slipped and the
boom swung around, striking the man a
heavy blow. He was knocked from the
girder upon wnich he was standing and a
few seconds later his body struck heavily
upon the artificial stone foundation sixty
feet below. In his downward flight the
man's body struck several heavy iron
beams. Braun struck upon the back of
bis head bursting open his skull.
A telephone message summoned the
ambulance irom the Receiving Hospital,
but it was fully half an hour before the
vehicle arrived. The man was still alive,
but unconscious. He died soon after
reaching the hospital and his body was
sent to the Morgue.
Braun was a 6inÂ«le man, about 55 years
of age and he lived at 515>^ Bush street.

Tiie Olympic Clnb will give a first-class
boxinn entertainment on Monday evening.
The superintendent lias arranged for five
special matches between the most expert
Lexers of the various athletic ciubs.
The wheelmen expect to witness ?ome
iirst-class racing on the Velodrome track
i his afternoon if the weather permits.
Football-players are deeply interested
in tbe great j:ame which will be decided
on Christmas day at Central Park between
the Olympic and Butte City teams. The
Olympic boys are in splendid condition,
and their friends will back them heavily
to defeat their stalwart opponents from
the north.
There is comparatively nothing doinjr in
aquatic circles. The oarsmen are resting
on their oars until the spring days, when
the shells will again be seen cleaving the
waters of the bay.
There is quite a stir in amateur baseball.
Several games are on the tapis which
should attract considerable attention.
Sportsmen are having good duck-shoot
ing in the lower country.
THE WHEELMEN.
Champion Zlegrler Issues a Sweep

Walter B. Fawcett went to Fresno on
Thursday in advance Â«f the coterie of rac
ing men who intended going down to take
part in to-day's meet to see if the
weather, track and all arrangements were
in proper form, lie telegraphed back yes
terday: "Weather line; track good;
notify al! concerned to come." The re
sult was that a large party went down
yesterday afternoon and wlli remain for
several days. There were seventeen pro
fessional racers, includine all who have
been performing at the Velodrome. If
the track be good the Fresno people will
see some excellent racing, as the men
have all been in constant training here
and are in fine shape.
The Garden City Cyclers' minstrel en
tertainment next Monday evening prom
ises to be very entertaining. A number of
the clubs have various little social fea
tures planned for the holiday weeks, all
of which will serve to keep up the club
spirit and interest.
President-elect Swain of tbe California
Associated Cycling Clubs states that he
\|ill announce his committee appoint

will be awaited with considerable in

Rear-Admiral Gherardi, senior admiral
of the ifnited States navy, has joined the
League of American Wheelmen. There
is nothing like being in good company,
and now is a good time to send in your
application or to send to the cycling edi
tor of Tint Call for blanks and pamphlets
telling of the advantages of a ieague
membership.
Tbe membership committee of the
North California division, LÂ°ague of
American Wheelmen, offers two caih
prizes of $25 and $10 for the persons who
will send in the lirst and second largest
number of applicants for membprship to
tue league from December 1, 1896, to De
cember 1, 1897.
The programme for the meet to be held
at the Velodrome on Christmas day is the
best of any offered at tlie fleets held thus
far. It includes a one-tmra of a miJe
scratch and a mile handicap, professional ;
half a mile scratch and a mile handicap,
amateur; also a matcn race between W.
E. Becker (Minneapolis) and C. E. DoÂ»v
(Seattle) for the Velodrome shield, at one
mile, unpaced, and several exhibition
rides and record trials. Otto Ziegle.- Jr.
will not ride. He seems to be a "little
demon" for changing his mind at least,
for only a short fortnight ago he an
nounced that he was going into active
training for the Velodrome Christmas day
meet. There will De plenty of talent with
out him, however.

The Imperial Cycling Club is complet
ing the erection of its gymnasium in the
rear of the cluorooms on Van Ness ave
nue. There will be a members' meeting
next Monday evening. The club will
hold its fourth party Tuesday evening,
January 19, at Native Sons' Hall.
The following letter has been received
from John W. Dermoody of the Garden
City Cyclers. San Jose, the trainer of
Hardy Downing, and it explains itself:
Cycling Editor of The. Cal', San Francisco: I
would like to sta'ie through the columns of
your paper that we have not made arrtinge
ments with any one as yet in regard to joining
a racing tenni with Allan Jones as the star. As
Mr. Downing has defented Mr. Jones more
times this season than Jones has defeated
him, I do not deem it advisaCle for him to join
a team With Mr. Jones as star until he lias
proven himself hs Â«uch. I still have charge of
Mr. Downing and will continue in charge
until he sees tit to make a change.
I would also like to state lor Otto Ziegler Jr.
that he will ride any man on the coast at the
first meet given on the Snn Jose track for r
purse or any part of $1000. Very truly
yours, J. W. Dermoody,
for If. Downing and Otto Zk-gier Jr.
Ziegler's sweeping challenge will no
doubt attract a great deal of attention,
and the only regret i? that he specifies tbe
San Jose track, as it seems improbable
that there will be a meet heid on it in the
near future; at least, the Garden City
Cyclers have given no intimation that
they intend holding one. Let Ziegler
agree to race on the Velodrome track,
which is, if anything, faster, and he
would have a number of challenges on his
hands, and no doubt the Velodrome |
'people would put up a good purse for the j
contest. A match between Ziegler and
Arthur Gardiner, who is now in Denver,
would be a great drawing card, and Gardi
ner would doubtless come here if he saw
chances of its being arranged. He has
offered to come lor his expenses here and
br'.ck to Chicago. Or a match between
Ziegler and Foster would be another at
traction worth witnessing. It will be a

This will be a move in the right direction
and the triumvirate will make one power

Wiih Isaac B. Potter out of the fieht
even Sterling Elliott's chances for the
presidency of the League of American
Wheelmen are not very rosy, as there is a
decided boom in favor of the present first
vice-president, Charles F. Cossum of New
York, whom the leading Eastern cycling
journals are all supporting and who
would probably make an excellent officer.
ii. H. Laverty, the popular editor of the
Pacific Field, has been elected secretary

doubtless till the position very accepta

Olympic Club Entertainment Mon
day Eveningâ Will the Big Battle

to the members on Monday evening.
The matches are all special, and, as
the contestants slated to appear are all

well up in the art of self-defense, some
very clever boxing is sure to result.
Huyes and Eapan will box at 135 pounds.
Carter and Koster will box at 145 pounds.
Mulligan and Biown will meet at 125
pounds, Reay and Lynch will box at 125
pounds, I^awlerand Schuler at 120 pounds,
and Curley and Lewis at 147 pounds. The
boxers will meet under the colors of the
Olympic, Manhattan, Acme, San Fran
cisco and Sacramento Athletic clubs.
Leader Taylor states that members only
wili be allowed to witness tbe bouts, and
that no special invitations will be issued
under any circumstances. It is the in
tention of the leader and his assistants to
finish the sport on Monday evening, and
with that object in view the first bout will
be called promptly at 8 o'clock.
It is to oe hoped that nothing in the
way of a barrier will spring up to cause an
indefinite postponement of a long
pending meeting between the two great
champions of the ring, viz. : Corbett and
Fitzsimmons, who, according to latest
accounts, will meet on March 17 to settle
the long-pending question of supremacy
in a contest to a finish.
Dan Stuart, the renowned sporting man
who is engineering the affair, must have
some good assurance from the authorities
of tbe place where he proposes to pitch
tbe stakes that there will not be any in
terference to the scheme he has in con
templation.
Corbett has time and again stated that
unless Stuart will positively guarantee
him freedom from po'ice interference he
would not sign articles to meet Fitzsim
mons in a battle to a finish. The fact
that he so readily consented to Stuart's
terms in a recent conference which was
held in New York is pretty good evidence
that Corbett is pleased with the terms of
the great promoter of finish battles.
Fitzsimmons appears to be delighted
with the outlook.. He says that it was an
asrreeable surprise to him to learn that
Corbett had agreed to Stuart's terms.
Julian cannot understand why Stuart
named March 17 as the day on which the
heavy-weight championship is to be de
cided.
"This is a great Irish day, you know,"
said Julian smiiing, "and as I have not
tiie remotest idea of the place where
Stuart intends pulling off the m-fitch, I
am inclir.ed to think that my friend Dan
has had a private conference with some of
the Irish kings, and that the battle may
possibly take place on the spot where
Donnelly Â»nd Cooper fought several years
a?o for the championship of the United
Kingdom."
The pugilists will have three months to
train for this great event, Â«nd if they are
reported to bÂ« in good trim for a finish
argument tbe betting will certainly be
great, as Fitz and Corbett have supporters
who will wager large sums of money on
their respective chances of success.
It is now too early to venture an opinion,
but it c<n be safely said, however, that if
Corbett can prove to the sportinu worid
thnt he will be lit and \teil to engage in a
finish battle a few weeks before the day
selected for a pa*Â«age-at-arms the betting
will be strongly in his favor, as be is un
questionably the superior of Fitzsimmons,
that is, scientifically speaking.
The Comisiiman, although"not so shifty
nor as clever as the champion, is never
theless a most dangerous opponent, who
may turn the tide of battle in his favor at
any point in the game. Whoever wins
the championship, the contest will be
well worth going many miles to witness.
GUN AND CARTRIDGE.
Result of the Supreme Court De
cisionâLast Hunters' Train.
The lovers of duck-shooting who have
enjoyed many pieasant days' sport bag
ging game on lands that were posted with
notices warning trespassers to keep off the
premises have at last concluded that they
must either do as others have done, viz :
lease shooting-grouDds, or else refrain
from indulging in the pleasures of the
chase.
The Sportmen's Protective Association,
! which was organized in this City some
j years ago for the purpose of defeatine if
possible the aims "of the clubs that, were
leasing large tracts of unreclaimed marsh
lands, made a gallant fight in the interest
of the men who could not afford the ex
penditure of large suras of money annu
ally for the pleasure that accrued from
duck-shooting expedition?.
The association scored several victories
In the lower courls, but when the "Pre
berve Clubs" carried the war into
the higher tribunals, the association
met with a severe defeat. In fact, the
j opinion which was rendered by the
I Supreme Court recently on the preserve
j question has finally "settled all argu
ment.
Even Superior Judge Buckles of Solano
County, who decided against the Cordelia
and Teal clubs last year in a suit to re
strain joaciiers from trespassing upon the
lauds which the club 3 had leased,
acknowledged, by granting injunctions a
few weeks ago to the Cordelia Club, that
j the judgment of the Supreme Court is
inviolable.
As matters now stand it is thought that
the Sportsmen's Protective Association at
its next meeting will wisely conclude
that future contests in the courts will end
i unfavorably to its members, and in view
i of that lact reorganization will be ueces-
I sary.
Although the association cannot afford
to have a pres -rye as splendidly arranged
as\the Cordelia, Teal, Ibis ana o'her clubs
of a similar kind, it can nevertheless lease
considerable property in Aiameda and So
noma counties at a small annual rental,
on which good shooting may be had if the
birds are protected during the breeding
seasons. Ponds can b- fed at a nominal
figure, and the birds will be sure to visit
such places as will afford them good pick
ing under cover of the darkness.
Had not the Supreme Court decided
figainst the association the battle would
have gone merrily on, but as it would
prove a most idiotic idea on the part of an
association to attempt to overrule the
rinding-* of a Supreme bench it is pre
sumed that a move in the right direction
under the present conditions will be taken
at the next meeting of the sportsmen,
which will be on Saturday, January 2
1897. ' '
Harry Corbett, Captain KitVen. "Bogie"
O'Donnell ana Jimmy Kvan are on a duck
hunting expedition to Suisun. Latest ac
counts from the "seat of war" stale that
Corbett baeged twenty-three mudhens in
Shelldrako Slough with the first discharge
of his gun and that lie had the pleasure
of sampling tiie mud in the bottom of the
slough in the attempt ai retrieving a
wounded widgeon.
"Bogie" McDonald was placed out as a
decoy for white geese and proved a most
successful lure, as Captain Kitsen killed
twenty of the birds over him.
Richard Brooks and Henry Venker left
this City yesterday for Antioch, where
they wifl be joined this evening by Jack
Lemmer and a friend. The sportsmen ex
pect to return with a large number of
birds.
Billy McÃae returned yesterday from
Delano. He reports that the market
hunters are slaughtering mallard ducks
by the hundreds. They use four-bore
guns, which are placed on the backs of
trained oxen. The animals are driven up
to within twenty yards of the flocks and
then the hunters blaze away, killing Ire
quentlv sa many as fiity birda at one sin
gle discharge of the Dig fowline-pieces.
The use of guns larger than ten-bora is
unlawful, but there appears to be no one
who will take sufficient interest in the
protection ot game to cause the arrest of
the transgressors.
The Fish and Game Commissioners pay
no attention to the reports that have been
mailed to them. They contend that they
have enough to do to look after the
fisheries department.
Frank Dolliver, Al Newman and Colonel
Cracknell of New York shot on the
marÃhes of Point Reyes last Sunday, but,
as the day was exceptionally fine, the
sportsmen had very poor success.
Some good bags of ducks were made
during the past week on the Alviso
marshes.
The extra Saturday night service for
hunters on the San Francisco and North
Pacific Railroad, which was inaugurated
on October 17, to Ignacio, Black Point,
Reclamation, Sears Point, McGill, Bchell
ville, Novato and Burdell, will discontinue
with this evening. In future the boat
which leaves for Tiburon every Saturday
night at 11:30 o'clock will make connec
tion with the train which runs only as far
aR San Rafael.
E. J. Beil states that good hunting can
be hai in the marshes of Suisun, near
Espinosa station. Last week the number
of birds killed in Shelldra&e Slough by
the sportsmen who visited his ark was
359. which included mallard, teal, widgeon
and sprig ducks. Bell further states that
the hunting-grounds are outside of the
lands leaseel by the gun clubs and that
scuilinc will be lirst class from now until
the close of the season.
CORBETT'S BIG WAGER.
He Wants Fitzsimmons to Cover a
Side Bet of 550.000.
When Bob Fitzsimmons was shown a
dispatch that was received from Jim Cor
bett last evening he smiled blandly and
remarked that "the professor was either
blurting or drawing a very long financial
bow."
Corbett's dispatch read that if FitzÂ«im
mons will wire the stakeholder how much
he wants to fight for he (Corbett)
will put up coin to the amount of $50,000
in the stakeholder's hands to-day, and
that tho Cormshman can mail his check.
"Now you see how this fellow Corbett is
acting already," said Fitzsimmons when
he glanced at the figures contained in the
dispatch. "Just think of it. He must
have caught a good thing somewhere. I
notice that he has grown very wealthy of
late.
"When we met in New York previous to
my departure for the West tbe fellow
could not raise $10,000, and to please him
I reduced the aide bet to half that sum,
juÂ«t to accommodate the champioi., who
said, in the presence of many witnesses,
that he was financially strapped.
"He is evidently of the opinion, now
that I am broke, and wants to corner me.
but I will fool him. I cannot say how
much I can rai^e, bui you can quote me
as saying that I will be able to meet any
siae bet of Corbett's up fo $25,000.
"I am positive that Corbett is bluffing,
as usual, and may try to crawl out of a
finish fight on the strength of bis bluffs.
"Al Smith, who is the stakeholder, is
satisfactory to me. 1 will leave for New
York in a few days, just as soon as I can
complete so trie little business transactions I
have here, and then I will talk business
to Corbett's face, i don't believe in 'the
professor's' method of transacting affairs
pugilistic over the wires. I will have
money to wager all right, and if Corbett
is as anxious to fight as 1 am, the enam
pidnsiitp battle will be decided on March
17, according to Stuart's agreement."

BASEBALL.
The Aiameda Alerts Play the San
Francisco Athletic Club Team
To- Morrow.
The San Francisco Athletic Club and
the Aiameda Alerts will cross bats at Cen
tral Park to-morrow. It is thought that
the Alerts have met their match at last.
The Athletic blub has shown whataDility
it possessed by defeating the crack ama
teur teams of this City and winning the
handsome banner offered by Will & Fiuck.
As both teams have a great many ad
mirers Central Park will have a large and
enthusiastic crowd to-morrow.
The Conway and Baumel Baseball Club
has an open challenge to any amateur
team on the coast, and are anxious to play
the Alameaa Alerts, All challenges should
be sent to William Hart. 5 Sixth street.
The Call Baseball Club has reorgan
ized for the season of '96-97 and are
anxious to hear from any amateur team
in ihe State. The Calls refuse to allow
the San Francisco Athletic Club to claim
the amateur championship of the City, as
they never defeated the Calls and have
beeh defeated by the Examiner team.
The Calls have played a tie series with
the Examiners and would like to hear
from the San Francisco Athletic Club
team or any amateur team in the State.
Address challenges to James E. Powers,
manager Call Baseball Club, 327 Bryant
street.
THE RIFLE.
The Third Great American Bundes
Shooting Festival.
On Sunday there will be several of the
rifle shooting clubs represented at
Schuetzen and Shell Mound Park ranges.
The Norddeutscher Schuetzen Club, the
San Francisco Schuetzen Verein and the
Germania Schuetzen Club will hold
monthly shooting contests at Shell Mound
Park. The following is an extract from
the Hebrew, Philo Jacoby editor:
We have published in a former issue that
Comrade Ehrenplort, in answer to his tele
graphic invitation to the Independent New
York. Schuetzen to have tbem visit San Fran
cisco in r body next year, has received an an
swer thnt they were already pledged to attend
the German Bundes Snooting Festival in
Nuernberg. William V. Weber, the captain of
the above-named association, wnres to Com
rade Khrenpfort that it is the genernl desire of
the Eastern marktmen to hold the third great
American Bundes Shooting Festival in Sau
Francisco. The Independent New York
Scfiuetzen besides attending the Bundes shoot
ins festival in Nuernberg will visit Munich,
Salzburg, Vienna, Tyroi, Switzerland, Neu
mdt, A. H.. and Bingen, and trave; bvsteamer
up the Rhine. November 2G there were al
ready eighty marksmen pledged to be of tbe
party. Captain Weber sends his best wishes to
all California mark>men, especially to those
who composed the California delegation last
year at the Bundes Snooting Festival in New
York and won greut honors and prizes there.
THE ANGLER.
Steelhead Fishing Will Be Good
When the Rivers Run Clear.
Latest intelligence from the angling re
sorts is to the effect that the rivers will
not bo in condition for steelhead fishing
until after a week, at least.of fine weather.
It is said that a number ot large fish are
now far above the tide waters, and that
the spearmen are sharpening their instru
ments of torture in expectation of, having
"some great sport" when the rivers are
running clear.
John' Butler and some companions will
leave for Duncans Mills to-day. A dis
patch from Mr. Morgan states that the
Russian River is clearing rapidly and that
good sport should result on Sunday.
At Point Reyes a large gathering of
fishermen "roed" for trout last Sunday,
but as tne stream was very muddy vefy
little sport was had. Dr. James Whatt
hooked a projecting limb of a tree in
making a long-distance cast and succeeded
in landing a Scotch thistle, much to tne
amusement of Chaplain Terry, who in
formed the venerable disciple of bait fish
ing lhat a less muscular effort would have
stamped him as being a polished angler.
Tne doctor is a nnn believer in mus
cular effort, and he has been known to
land a 15-pound steelhead with one mighty
yank of his powerful right arm.
* Frank Marcus Jr. lost a large fish by
emulating the tactics of the doctor. A
few small tish were taken during the day.
Should the weather remain fine Ponu
Reyes Creek will be in goou condition in
a week or SO.
Some nice fish were cauzht in bonoma
Creek near Khellville last Sunday.
THE OARSMEN.
Doings of the Boating Clubs Along
the Bay Shore.
A committee has been appointed by the
Carnival of tbe Golden Gate and that com
mittee has set aside a aay for a regatta.
It would be a gooo. idea if the committee
aDpointed a prominent amateur oarsman
to take charge of the affair. Rowing on
this coast has reached such a magnitude
that a regatta conducted properly would
attract great attention.
If it is the intention of the carnival com
mittee to hold a recatta it should notify
tbe Pacific Amateur Association at once,
that a sanction may be granted.
Adam Schuppcrt, the old-time oarsman,
is coaching the members of the Dolphin
Club, and every Sunday be has a crew out
for practice. Under h& instruction they
are making rapid progress. To-morrow
â¢toe will take out C. If. Farrell, T. R. Kee
Â»i>n and W. O. Patch for a practice spin.
Charles Farrell defeated Pete yon
Hadeln in an exciting canoe race last Sun-
T* J. Sullivan was out in Keenan's
wherry, and was doing well until he lost a
wlied'off his sLding-seat.
William Schumacher and Thomas Hop
kins are doing stea'iy work in the skift3,
with intentions of entering the next re
gatta.
The British ship captains have arranged
a series of races to be held at Sausalito to
day at 3p. m. Nearly every vessel flying
the British flag has entered a boat, aud
some exciting contests are expected.
Handball.
The handball games which will take
place to-morrow at the San Francisco
court are:
P. Barrett and J. O'Lenry v?. Hugh Moffit
and J. Brannock, M. McClura and S. Cuney
vs. M. Edwaras and W. Stansbury. P. Ryan and

Sacramento Sporting: News.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Dec. 18.â The cloud of
gloom and sadness which has hung over many
members ot the Sacramento Athletic Club
since the defeat of their champion by Theo
dore Vau Buskirk and the disappearance of
many a hard-earned shekel is gradually pass
ing, but there are many will be sore for time
immemorial.
Johnson's science as displayed in the first
two rounds, when Van Buskirk "found it was
as hard to find_him" as the Irishman's flea,
has simply impressed many witn tbe idea that
had Johnson only continued the same tactics
he would eventually have won out, and they
are sore, "so sore," but the majority are satis
fied that it was a simple impossibility for
Johnson to stop or avoid the. big one's mad
rushes. It is said that an endeavor will be
made to arrange a match between Vau Bus
kirk and Stenzler, who is again anxious to
meet the former during the coming mouth.
(.'oursins still continues to boom here and
the park is an unqualified success in every
particular. There was a twenty-six dog puppy
stake last Sunday, in which S. A. Cummiugs'
Litt.e Deligtu captured first prize. J. Stout's
Lord Lonsdale took second prize. Nethercott's
Cantain Nemo third and Hall's Electricity
fourth. Next Sunday there will bt, an opan
all-aged stake, in which there will be at least
lorty-four entries. H. H. Devine, who is act
ing as judge, is rendering decisions which are
claimed by all to be fair and impartial, giving
universal satisfaction. S. A. Cummmgs is
slipper. On Sunday next there will also be a
ruateii race for if 100 a side, best three out of
five courses, between J. Mangan's puppy Prin
cess Ailene (Gare-Lady 11. Glendyne) and J.
Stout's puppy Kitty Lonsdale (Gile-Lily of the
West), and lots of outside money will change
hands. On New Year's day the park will close
to allow the Sacramento men to attend the big
meet at Ingleside.
There is not much enthusiasm among the
duck-hunters of late, there belns: more work
than sport in getting a bag, as the iate storm
has driven tlie ducks inio the open water, and
they are consequently hard to approach. Out
in ihe great Yoxo basin there Â«re millions of
the birds. That old veteran, Willinra Gerber,
went to Teal Lake Sunday and killed twelve
mall&rds, but then Billy "is always next to him
self in the fieid and marsn. Smith and
Brown got eighty-three birds, thirty-seven
being mallards. Thia is the largest bag made
iv two weeks, and the rest of the sports are
trying to find out where the killing was done.
The most provoking of all things which has
happened in years to disturb the serenity of
miud of the local sportsmen is the appearance
of the jjck snipe ia the marshes lying within
the city limits, and the sportsmen do not care
to shoot them as the police are vigilant and
shooting within the city limits is expensive.
The birds are here iv hundreds and within a
block of the streetcar lines. A sportsman who
wÂ«8 up with the early bird made a sneak on
the authorities yesterday morning and bagged
twenty-two before the police got on to him; he
escaped capture but will not try it again.
Preparations are on the tapis for the open
ing of the trap season and several Christmas
shoots will be held in the adjoining vicinities,
notably at the Union House Club grounds.
The Capital City Wheelmen are making
preparations for their first run of the season
which will be to Stockton and return starting
Irom this ciiy at midnight on the last day oi
the year. Last New Year day Hubert made
the round trip twice without stopping, a dis
tance of two hundred miles in all. He may
attempt the same feat again. Consul Frank
Dwyer has been in the city during the past
weeK oa league matters. Rutherford.

Cotillon.
They Form Five Pretty Figures
Amid Brilliant Sur
roundings.
Characters Famous in History and
Fiction Gayly Trip the Light
Fantastic.
Buds and belles and stately matrons,
with powdered hair and fetching patches,
resplendent as stately ladies of the court,
characters famous in fact and fiction, or
attired in the picturesque habiliment of
the peasant, met and danced at Odd
Fellows' Hall last evening, and helped to
make the Christmas cotillon of the Friday
Nifrht Club a brilliant success.
The greatest diversity prevailed &% to
costuming, and the result was more than
beautiful. Stately Romola walked with
merry Beatrice, and a dainty Columbine
linked arms with Lady Teazle.
The gentlemen, with their usual
modesty, refrained from displaying their
symmetrical calves ana well molded limbs
in the many picturesque costumes they
might have worn with such becoming
advantages. Even tho Burlineame men
thrust aside their "pink coats," and as far
as dress went, the gentlemen of the
cotillon were all "flat, stale and unprofit
able.'
Never did Odd Fellows' Hall look as
handsome as last evenine. The skillful
decorators fairly outdid their happy
.effects at the initial cotillon, a no easy
task.
The hall was all draped In red, deep
rich red, that made the pavillion glow with
warmth and brilliant color. On the stage
were potted palms and ferns and brakes,
and in the midst of all the wealth of
greenery, three majestic poinÂ«ettia thrust
their flaming. blossoms to the front.
Lamps shed a soft radiance over the
scene, lamps all shaded in red.
The straight, hard outline of the gallery
was hid by the many potted palms that
found place there. Had these .palms been
removed they would have disclosed a small
army of "juniors, to whom we look for our
belles and beaux of the future. At the i
Christmas cotillon little sisters and broth
ers are allowed to come and from the gal
leiy watch the more fortunate members
of their family as they move through the
intricate figures of the german.
Miss Alice Hager led the cotillon with
the assistance of Miss Van Ness, Miss Sal
lie Maynard and Miss Laura Bates.
In the first set were Miss Daisy Van
Ness and Dana Kilburn, Miss Sallie* May
nard and S. G. Boardman, Miss Laura
Bates and Lieutenant Rodgers, Miss Mary
Bel! Gwin and R. M. Eyre, Miss Alice
Hoffman and Latham McMuilin, Miss

Miss Romie Wallace and A. D. Keys, Miss
Bertha Smith ana Thomas Breeze, Miss

Miss Haper introduced five figures:
First, the old but ever popular grand right
and left; second, the debutante's march;
third, the figure eight; fourth, fourcircles,
and filth, the sleigh bells and hoop.
In the four circles the sets danced round
a gorgeous Christmas tree and' the effect
\\a< most beautiful.
The easy manner in which Miss Hager
led won for her many encomiums.
At 11:30 the following elaborate supper

The Christmas festival of St. Mary's

STUDYING THE
WINE INTERESTS
Special Envoy G. Rossati
Arrives Here From
Italy.
Our While Wines and Light
Reds, He Says, Are Really
Excellent.
Difference Between the Eastern and
California Grapes â Italy's Expert
Stations Over the World.
Signor G. Rossati, special envoy of the
Italian Government to study the wine
industry in the United States, and make
an elaborate report thereon, is at the Cali
fornia.
Italy for some years past has had what
it calls expert stations in the great cities
of the world, where the best Italian wine
is kept for advertising purposes, and where
expert wine men lire in charge. It is the
duty of the experts to detect all adultera-
SPECIAL ENVOY GUIDO ROSSATI of Italy, Who Is Here to
Report on the California Wine Interests.
[Sketched from life by a "Call" artUU
tiona, or attempted adulterations of Ital
ian wines, and thus keep the standard of
Italian wines high. Stations of this kind
are maintained in London, Switzerland,
New York and other cities.
Signor Rossati has had charge of the ex
pert station in Switzerland two years, of
the one in London s x years and of the
station in New York for about a year. He
was a thorough wine man in the Degin
mnÂ£. having been born to the business,
besides attending a wine-school for eight
y ears.
He has for some time past, in accord
ance with the duties as special envoy to
which he has recently been appointed,
been visiting New York, Ohio aud Mis
souri and studying the grape and wine
interests there.
Now he has come to California. He
has already spent several days in the out
lying vineyards, and has been examining
and testing the wines. He intends travel
ing all over the State, and will spend at
least a month here.
"Italy is desirous of extending the sale
of her wines," said Mr. Rossati, "but be
sides ibis she wants to learn all she can
ol the grape and wine industry, as carried
on in other parts of the world. Special
representatives have been sent by Italy
recently to all parts of the globe to get
this information.
"Wine-making is a mighty industry
with ns, and we want to keep in the front
in tne industry, and also create new mar
kets and extend old ones.
" The grape and wine industry in the
States East is entirely different from what
it is in Calitorma. Here it is almo3t ex
actly what it is in Italy. You grow the
sume grapes, have the same soil and
enmate and handle the business simi
larly, but on a great scale, as becomes a
great country like this.
"I have been surprised to find your
wines so good, especially tho white wines
and the light red, or Zmfaudels, with
which I am really charmed.
"All the grapes of the East consist of
the Lauruscas, or the Concords, Cataw
bas, Deiawares and similar varieties.
They are more a table grape than suitable
for wine. These grape* are indigenous to
the East, with one other kind mat I aaw
thÂ«re, tne Riparia, or wild grape, which
is found along tho Mississippi. They
tried to gra.t .hat grape, out did not sue
ceed with it. T..e grapes in these States
are subject to phylloxera, and there is no
good remedy ior that there. Besides,
they have the mildew. It is not really a
country for wines.
''This, on the contrary, is a natural
'wine country. You have the viniferous
varieties here as we have in Italy. 1 shall
stay here for a month and go allovcrthe
State."
Signor Rossati was unfortunate in fall
ing a day or two ago on his left hand and
fracturing his left wrist. In consequence
he has it in plaster of naris and yesteiday
was in bed all day to rest. He expects to
be fully recovered by Monday.
A EUREEA ROMANCE
Miss Evans to Travel 5000 Miles to
Wed Luuis Putnam.
Among the passengers arriving on the
steamer Pomona from Eureka yesterday
was Miss Annie Evans, who contemplates
a voyage of 5000 miles across the broad Pa
cific, to terminate in a happy weddin:-.
Miss Evans is an accomplished young
society belle of Eureka. She is the third
daua liter of Manager Da via Evans of the
Excelsior Kedwood Company, one of the
best-known redwood millmen on the coast,
and is a native of Eureka, where she was
i orn twenty-two years ago.
The happy man is Louis Putnam, 25
yearn of age, who occupies a responsible
position with the branch of toe American
Trading Company at Kobe. He is the
only son of the veteran hotel man, A. J.
Putnam of Eureka, and while not a native
of that place, crew to manhood there. In
fact, the attachment of the young couple
dates back to their school days in Eureka.
Mis 3 Evans, after spend ing a few days in
San Francisco, will continue her journey
by rail to Tacoma, where a married sister
resides, thence to Vancouver, B. C, to
take the steamer to Yokohama.
NO MORE BANANA PEELS.
The Supervisors Will Probably Pnss an
Ordinance Â»t Monday's Meeting
Abating the Nuisance.
The Health and Police Committee of
the Board of Supervisors decided yester
day to recommend for passage the or
dinance presented by the Bonrd of Health
prohibiting the throwing of banana peels
and other rubbish on the floors of public
buildings and streetcars and on the side
walks of public streets.
Tne committee also decided to return to
the board without recommendation the
ordinance prohibiting; expectoration in
ttie places named in the otlier measure.
LIBEL TO BE REHEARD.
Wlllinm K. Hearst Secure* a New Trial
in the tuit With Lotta's
Lawyer.
Technicalities have saved William R.
Hearst, for the present at least, from the
consequences of a libel of which he was
found guilty in the Superior Court, upon
John W. Turner. The Supreme Court
yesterday ordered a retrial.
The story which caused the trouble for
Mr. Hearst was printed in the Examiner
December 7, 1893. The central point was
an allegation that Lotta Crabtree, the
actress, bad caused Turner's arrest upon
criniinul charges and that the case was
compromised by notes given by a Plumas
County lawyer to the acress.
The Supreme Court rinds that Turner
was Lotta's lawyer and t at it was an
other man with whom she had trouble.
The story got into the Examiner by the
act of a reporter who. in rewriting an item
from the Evening Post about the case,
mixed up the names. Hearst escaped for
the time being because Judge Dainger
rieid instructed the jury that it was the
duty of the Examiner to apologize to
Turner; and also because Judse SlacK,
who sat one day during the trial of the
libel, in the absence of Judge Dauigerrield,
failed to pass on the bill of exceptions
taken while he presided.
FATHER YORKE DISMISSED.
Judge Campbell Held the Complaint to
lie Fatally Defective.
Tho preliminary examination of Father
P. C. Yorke for criminal libel alleged to
have been committed in an article pub
lished in the Monitor reflecting on George
Thistleton was yesterday briefly disposed
of. A large crowd, chiefly the friends of
the defendant, was in attendance and it
was found necessary to remove from Judge
Campbell's courtroom to the more
spa-ious quarters of Judi?e Joachiir.yen.
Even then only a small portion ot those
in waiting could be admitted.
After reading the complaint W. W.
Foote made a technical objection to the
complaint. In the discubsion Judge
Campbell raised the point that the alleged
libelous statement to the effect that "the
rea hand of Rome had landed him in San
Quentin" was not sufficiently specific.
Foote urged the point, declaring It was
necessary in a criminal complaint to con
strue a complaint strictly. K. M. Smith,
Thiatleton's attorney, argued that the
words should be taken in their comrcon
acceptation in the State in whicti they
are used. Judge Campbell, however, held
that the statement that a man had been
landed at San Quentin did not necessarily
imply he had keen there as a convict and
accordingly dismissed the case.
Smith says a new complaint will be
filed.

Waldteufel Statuary.
The United States Grand Jury was engaged
yesterday in looking into the Waldteufel stat
uary case. It will be remembered that several
mouths ago Treasury Agent Major Moore
called the attention of Collector Wise to the
fact that there were exposed for sale in A.
Waldteufel & Co.'s store on Market street three
statues intended lor church purposes, upon
which duties l:ad not been paid, und which
had been imported into the country with an
order of similar goods for Rev. Father Hahn
of Banning. This work was evidently done by
falsifying tho invoice. The goods at the Mar
ket-street store were seized and now the
Grand Jury is encienvorlng i o find who is the
guilty party who got the goods landed under
the circumstances stated. The priest irom
Banning wns among the witnesses before the
jury yesterday.
Garcia GoeÂ« to State Prison.
"This man seems to think he has a rlsrht to
take human life whenever he is provoked and
I cannot see that it is a case of leniency," said
Judge Wallace yesterday when Joseph Garcia,

up for sentence. His Honor thought thm
kind of a man dangerous while nt large and
retired him to San Quentin at hard labor for
ten years.
Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria.
TWICE ONE'S TWO,
SAYS THE COURT
Mathematics Applied to
Turlock Irrigation
Bonds.
Lands Were Advertised for Sale
to Pay Interest Money
Claimed Due.
Stockholders Now Have Secure! an
Order for the Renewal of
tn Irjunction.
The sale of realty belonging to stock
holders of the Turlock irrigation district
for failure to pay an assessment to raise
interest payments on the bonds of the
district wilt be stayed. This was decided
practically by the Supreme Court yester
day in the case of Hughson et al. vs. Crane.
The last named, Crane, was the collector
of the Turlock irrigation district, and
advertised the property of several of the
stockholders for sale because they were
delinquent in their assessment?. They
secured a temporary injunction against
Crane. He demurred to the proceedings
in some particular. Now the Supreme
Court has instructed the Superior Court
to overrule the demurrer, which the Supe
rior Court previously sustained, and also
has reversed the order by which the in
junction acainst Crane was dissolved.
The Supreme Court finds, as the result
of a little figuring, that the stockholders
were justified in not paving the assess
ment levied to provide the interest on tne
bonds. This figuring is as follows:
Deducting from $524,000, which is alleged
to be tne amount ot bunds in question in the
case, the sum of $150,000, the amount of
bonds "whicn arc specifically shown to have
been Illegally delivered to Gorrill," and there
remains only $374,000 in bonds for which an
assessment coulu be levied. The total amount
of the assessment was over $40,000. The in
terest on $374,000, at the rate of 6 percent
per annum, would amount to $23,200, and
when the assessment was laid there was
nearly $10,000 in tho treasury applicable to
pay the assessment.
The wording of the opinion, which was
written by Justice Harrison, was clear
concerning tho liability of the stockhold
ers for this particular assessment, being
as follows: "It" the facts set forth in the
complaint are true they sufficiently justi
lied the refusal of the plaintiffs to pay the
assessment, and call upon tne defendant
fit ncr to deny their existence or re-estab
lish other facts that will give Dim the
rieht to collect the assessment by the sale
of the plaintiffs' lands."
The validity ot the bonds was not
brought into question in this suit and the
Supreme Court called attention to the
fact. The joining of Gorrill or HicKman
in the suit it was also said I. y the court
was not necessary. L. M. Hickman was
the man who in 18'JJ bought $550,000
bonds ol tue oricinai issue of $000,000,
at the rate of 90 per cent ot their full
value, with the tigreement that he was to
pay the district for all that he received
above 00 per cent after deducting the cost
of selling them. He did not pay for any
bonds. Gorrill was the contractor who
built the dam for the irrigation system
and took $150,000 in bonds in payment for
his work. Hickman was merely the agent
of the board of directors for the sale of
the bonds. The decision in this case will
prove interesting throughout the San
Joaqmn Valley and to all persons con
nected with California irrigation districts,
either as stockholders or holders of the
bonds. .
"CHRIST BEFORE PILATE"
The Rrplica, by Nelson A.
Primus of Boston, Is
Exhibited.
It Will Be Shown Every Night Next
Week to Audiences of the ,
Co umbia Iheater.
A private view of a copy of the famous
painting, "Christ Before Pilate," was
given yesterday afternoon at the Colum
bia Theater. All who saw the picture
were invited by Messrs. Friedlander,
Goitlob & Co. and presented with a full
description of it, so that an intelligent
idea of what it represented could be had.
During the afternoon a stream of people
passed through the theater doors to see
the painting.
After leaving the sunlight the change
was so great that a first impression of the
picture was not satisfaclory. The electric
light shining down upon a large canvas
was disturbing. The colors appeared to
be largely dominated by browns.
This feeling soon wore away, however,
on becoming accustomed to the darK
theater and the lighted picture, stretching
full across the stage. Then the life-size
figures came out strongly, and by degrees
matters of detail in drapery and features
began to show themselves, and the effect
was quite pleasing.
The picture was painted by Nelson A.
Primus in Boston and has been exhibited
in several cities. It will be shown every
night next week to Columbia audiences as
a compliment to patrons of the theater.
The following description of the paint
ing was given yesterday to those who
viewed it:
Shows the interior of the Praetorium, a
large, square apurtment, lighted through an
opening in the roof, with Christ standing in
the loreground facing l'ilate, before whom
Caiaphas is making a violeutspeech of accusa
tion. Groups of judges and curious spectators
on the right andamobcomposingthe worstele
ments of the population tii.lng the background
on the left. Only three personages can be defi
nitely ioentifled byname, Christ, Pilaieand Caia
phas. The hign priest, Caiaphas, stands erect
at the right of i'ilate; on a seat which extends
along a projection of the lower stair of the
judgment seat is a typical Pharisee, rich and
insolent. A figure whicii occupies a promi
nent position is the tcriDe, perched high on a
seat against the wall ; at the right of the Gov
ernor sit two judges; beniud Caiaphas and
Pharisee appear three priests, who are dis
cussing "the case"; to the leit of the judg
ment seat sit two other priests.
One-third oi the Praetorinm at the left, and
the vestibule, which opens on a suuny, Ori
ental lumiscape, are tilled with the surging
and raging multitude. They threaten to
crowd into the judgment hall, bnt a Roman
soldier checks them with hi^ extended spear.
To the left of Christ an impudent, knavish
goffer bends on one side and leans over tho
railing to sneer in the face of the Savior. On
tne left of the soldier a rude feilow lifts both
arms in the air ami cries out with wide open
mouth, "Crucify him !" T.ius giving the pass
word to the turbulent mob in tne background.
In the midst of the narrow-minded, fanatical
multitude stands a young mother holding a
child iv her urni.-, looking compassionately,
almost believing ou Christ. This is the only
iemale figure in the composition and hers Is
the only face expressing pity for the accused.
Thus it aeti as a foil, intensifying by compari
son the hatred and malignity in the laces by
which it is surrounded.

evils tears down the strongest constitution
and completely wrecks the mental and physi-
cal man. Thousands of young and middle-
aged men through this scourge of humanity
have found homes in insane asylums or filled
suicide's v graves. It has broken up mora
homes, caused more desertions and separ-
ations than all other evils combined. If you

"Lows" us' ally first appeal on the Washington

but when th* "low" I* Inclosed with Isobars of

one of the most eventful at the Stock Exchange
for a long lime past. Af.er a moderate decline the
usual rally ensued. Later, when news came from
Washington that the Senate Committee of Foreign
Relations decided to report - favorably the
Cameron resolution to recognize the Independence
of Cuba It did not take lung for the street to reach
a conclusion as to the Importance of this action,
and th-< dullness was a. most Immediately sup
planted by active and steady drillings at steadily

by leadhiK shares. The execution of stop orders
accelerated tin- downward movement, which was

tiiude to ' r..n\ .he market, but < ach recovery was
int't with a flooo of offering and toe suit whs at
tin' close many stock were at the lowest point of
the day.
The only marked rally was In Sugar, Beading,

DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK. N. V., Dec. 18.-R. o. Dun A Co.
will say to-morrow In their weekly review of trade:
Cuban reports, unusual closeness of money in
Germany and the decision that there will be no
action on the lar.ff at this session, have not really
changed the situation, hut have been talked about
a* If they might change It. The holiday trade Is
generally <rce, though at some points more con
fined to cheap goods 1 1' an usual, and the influence '
of an iix renscj,, the working torn? 1* f .It I 1 other i
ways. I'nt un n the new year the only material \
< nances expect^ are (acb as prepare for a large
business next year In the lion and seel lnJuatry
those appear of the utmost Importance.
. Mtni Â« even is for some month* to come will turn
largely on the state of foreign trade It Is cheering
thÂ»t produce exports In November were 9109,
-091.9 Â«7 In value, amounting for three months to
9307.749,687, more than double the value of Im
ports, which wire 9161,331,351. 'I he enormous
excess which has brouÂ«hi hliber In UtlCÂ« mouths
net Imports of gold amounting to 968.640.143, be
sides rstab.lshlng credits of many mil. lons in Lon
don which virtually pay In advance for future Im
port*, has not prevented, It is believed, a special
shipment of cold to Uerroany next week, for
wnlch the Germany bank pays a premium to
meet demands January 1. supposed to be on ltus
slan account. i<|Â»iÂ«i|ji>nilMHlÂ»iWÃ|iMlMUN*llU
London affects the shipment by borrowing more
million* here, so that the amount of xuch sterling |
advances is now reckoned . at 935,000.000. More
of such borrowing may cause advance in the rate
of Interes:, realizing on exchange draft*, of : which
many become due before or shortly at er January
1. and asharier demand on London than 1* con

CHURCH BAZAARS
Editor Whitaker to Settle
the Question With His
Own Congregation.
Can He Do in Oakland as Bishop
Riordan Once Did in
Chicago ?
Will Continue His 0 ficial Warfare
Against Fairs in Baptist
Churches.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
90S Broadway, Dec. 18. f
Can a church be maintained and kept
out of debt by legitimate offerings without
having recourse tq fairs and tut?
This question ia goiiu; to bo practical ly
decided next Wednesday at tho Twenty
third Avenue Baptist Church. At that
time the members will vote on the matter
and their choice will decide tho futuro
policy of the congregation in this regard.
Rev. Robert Whitakej is of the
church and has a very pronounced aver
sion to church fairs and b.-tÂ»ts;us. At dif
ferent times he has referr^vl to them as
"vensual an devilish," â â¢â liKely to con
vert â  person as is a horserace" ' and "of
do good except to raise none] "
Rev. Mr. Whitaker is one of the editors
Bof8 of tue organ of the Baptist Association of
this coast, known as tne Pacific Baptist.
About two months ago he published an
article, part of which was reproduced in
The Call, and attracted the attention of
churchmen all over the country. He re
ferred to the fact that when Archbishop
Kiordan was pastor of a Chicago church
his pastorate was most successful, spirit
ually and financially, and that the" future
prelate would not permit a fair or bazaar
in connection with his church. Mr. Whit
aker hmds that what Bishop Riordon
could do as pastor of a church in Chicago
Rev. Robert Whitaker can do as pastor of
a church in East Oakland.
Afier seeing in various newspapers in
terviews from leading ministers all over
the coast, some of whom arc opposed to
and others in favor of church fairs and
ITS, Mr. Whitaker has decided to
place the matter. before his congregation
and let the decision rest with them. This
B bus Deen taken partly because of
the oft-repeated statement that the con
gregation and not tne minister rule the
social side of the church work, and that
ninny pastors who are known to be op
posed to church fairs and lotteries are
alraid to speak* their minds because of the
opposition they wouid immediately arouse.
The congregation of the Twenty-third
Avenue Baptist Church, it is understood,
is in harmony with the ideas of tueir ptis
tor. It is stated that the work and ex
} ense contingent upon a successful bazaar
are far greater than the result justifies,
and that in nearly every instance :hose
who contribute labor, time and money
to a little bazaar would f.:r rather give a
decent amount of money outright and be
free fmm the worry and annoyance that
such affairs create.
The outcome of the vote at Mr. Whita
ker's church will be watched with much
interest, as the question na- fairly aroused
all the miniit- rs on the coast.

principal heirs. Property worth about
$1,000,000 was thus distributed.
H. D. Bacon died about three years ago,
leaving his property to be divided share
and share alike to his children: Frank
Page Bacon, Ella Etta Soule, Carrie Jen
nie B:icon, wit i the exception that if hi
wife, Julia Ann, survived him, she was to
have ail the community property. In the
distribution she is given the family
dwelling with tha. half block of land on
Fallon street on which it stands, with its
.furniture, library and works of art. There
i 3 only one exception to this distribution
of personal property: a service of silver
given to the deceased by the employes of
the Ohio and Mississippi Railroad, which
the deceased left to Frank P. Bacon.
Of the childrpn, Carrie Jennie has not
married. Ella Etta, who is the wife of
Professor Frank Soule, is now suing for a
divorce from her husband, and Prank P.
Bacon ia also being sued by his wife for a
separation.
Last August the widow and children
and the legatees, for a valuable considera
tion, conveyed to the Bacon .Land and
Loan Company all their intere-t in the
estate of the late Henry D. Bacon. They
then requested the court to order the dis
tribution of the estate to the incorporation,
and this wasdone to-day.
The liÂ«t of properties occupies many
pages of matter and shows ihe careful na
ture of the pioneer investor. It also dis
closes the cenero-ity with which the de
ceased viewed inventive i:eniu-, for there
are several items which show that he had
an interest in many patents. He was in
terested in a current-reversing key, in a
patent for induction apparatus for teleg
raphy and in over a dozen patents which
were pranted in all the countries of Eu
rope, India, Brazil and Canada.

WAS BERTHA KIDNAPED?
Superintendent Smiley of the
Boys' and Girls' Aid
Society Angry.
Says That He Will Apply to the
Supreme Court for a Writ to
Recover His Charge.
Superintendent Smiley of the Boys' and
Girls' Aid Society is angry. He will
probably sue out a writ of habeas corpus
in the Supreme Court to secure the person
cf Bertha Drews, a young girl, who was,
so Mr. Smiley says, yesterday kidnaped
from the institution of which he has
control.
Bertha Drews came to this City about
two months ago from the East. The So
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children became interested in her. She
was sheltered by the Boys' and Girls' Aid
Society. She has a sister in Brooklyn,
N. Y. Recently her sister, havme learned
ot her, raised money to take Bertha Dack
East. She was to have departed yester
day. Ihe Swedish Consul, she being a
Swede, was interested in her.
The Society for the Prevention of Cru
elty to Children ngrepd to conduct her to
the Swedish Consul, who bad the money
to pay for her fare. Accordingly Frank
Holbrook, an officer of the society, went
out yesterday afternoon to get her. When
he arrived tho girl was gone.
Superintendent Smiley told the story
last night. Yesterday afternoon Mr. Wil
liamson and his wile of Baden, Mrs. Wil
liatason being Bertha's sister, called at
the Boys' and Girls' Aid Society office
and asked to see Bertha. The request
was granted by the matron in the absence
of Mr. Smiley. The matron was com
peiled to go out of ihe room for a few
minutes, and when she returned Bertna
and her sister and her sister's hi.sband
wer6 pone. Supposedly they were on
their way to Baden, where the William
sons live.
As a result Bertha Drews did not start
yesterday on her overland journey. As
she is out of this county, it will be neces
sary to apply to the Supreme Court for
the desired writ of habeas corpus.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 19, 1896.
DINED AND STOLE
AND GAVE THANKS
Was Found by Tramps
Who Had Good Ap
petites.
While Farmer Martin and His
Wife Prayed Their House
Was Robbed.
The Thieves Leit a Note of Thanks
and Referred to Their Future
Movements-
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
SOB Broadway, Dec. 18. f
Thanks, we found the $60 ana will eat our nexc
dinner at the Palace Hotel, where we can be
foundâ Dit.
The above little note with no signature
was found by a farmer and his wife last
night on their return home.
Mr. and Mrs. Martin, who reside at a
ranch house between Decoto and Mission
San Jose, had a novel experience with two
or more unknown tramps last night. It is
thought that they are the victims of about
four road agents, as when they returned
from church the dinner-table looked as if
two relays of visitors had sat down and
eaten a hearty meal.
Last evening the occupants of the ranch
left their home to attend the prayer-meet
ing at the little church recently dedicated
at Decoto. They closed their doors,but with
the confidence that is usually felt in rural
districts they did not take the precaution
of locking doors or fastening windows.
When they had gone some tramps ap
proached the house and finding a ready
entrance and no one at home they at once
proceeded to rnako themselves comforta
ble. Judging by the complete prepara
tions made they must have depended on
the long absence of the family. The
tramps set table for two and ransacked
the larder for what they could find. It
looked 38 if two men had eaten and then
given place to two more, jÂ»s only two
cbairs were pulled up to the table, while
there were four plates with remnants on
them.
After eating the tramps looked around
for anything that was of value but not of
sufficient weight toproveanincumbrance.
Carefully hidden away under a sugar
bowl on a shelf was $60 in gold. This was
taken and appears to have satisfied the
tramps, as nothing else was missed.
Before leaving one of the robbers penned
the little note already referred to and
placed it on a conspicuous part of the
table.
When Mr. and Mrs. Martin returned
they found the note and at once rushed to
the place occupied by the sugar-bowl.
Their worst fears were realized. As they
could not iniorm the constable last night
the robber-tramps had a big start and
have not yet be n caught.
A NEW MOTOR CYCLE.
At Work Upon a New Invention â AI
bert Kynoch's Feculiar Predicament,
Making Other Children Happy.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Dec. 18.â The inven
tive genius of the Alameda Cyclers, Fred
WhiiÂ«", will soon begin work again upon
his motor cycle. Last spring Mr. White
made some rough drawings of an intended
invention, but when he undertook to
secure funds to carry out the plan* he
found that with ihe uncertainty of election
coming on and the lack of confidence
among business men it would be impos
sible to secure tie financial backing, so he
gave up work. Now, however, the uncer
tainty has changed and confidence has
Deen restored. Mr. White will begin
work afresh with tne new year. Already
the wheels and frame work are shaped
sufficiently to be put together.
"I have some ideas entirely different
from any motor now in use," said Mr.
White, "and I am satisfied that by the
time the spring rains are over I will have
one of the best moior cycles in the United
States in operation. The pneumatic tires
of the bicycle will be retained, which will
make tl.e machine noiseless. With such
jtroets as we have in this City I can make
good speed and have perfect control of
the cycle. It will have four wheels and
an iron frame, which will make it very
strong and durable."
A Finauclal Success.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Dpc. 18.â The ladies

Brigade. Some more will yet be added to
this amount, which will increase it to
$425. The ladies are very grateful to all
who assisted to make the affair a success.
They were particularly pleased with the
complete reports published in The Call
of each day's proceedings. "The power
of the press was fully illustrated, said
Miss W. H. Pollard, chairman of the com
mittee, "and we are very grateful to The
Call fur its good offices."

the man's condition. Mr. Kynoch has not
been sick, and his face gives no sign of
disease, it being very smooth and of its
natural color.

NO CLASH PROBABLE.
County Clerk Curry and Judge Belcher
Agree iv Regard to Trial Exhibits.
County Clerk Curry called on Judge
Belcher of the Superior Court yesterday
for the purpose of discussing an order re
cently issued by the Judge that exhibits
in criminal cases should hereafter be de
livered to the property clerk of the Police
Department at the conclusion of the trial.
Mr. Curry said he believed that he would
be neglectful of his duty if he should con
sent to the delivery of tho exhibits to the
.Police Department. H^ held that tha ex
hib ts properly belong in his custody, and
could not ses his way clear to surrender
ing ihem to any other officer.
An act of the Legislature approved Feb
ruary 2, 1872, iv retard to the duties of the
clerk of the City and County of San Fran
cisco provides as follows:
No Judge or other officer of any court shall
make any order for the delivery by the Couii ty
Cleric of t-aid. City and County o! San Francisco
of any paper, files or records in his custody.
Touching this mater Judge Belcher
subsequently remarked that he had no de
sire to invade the prerogatives of the
County Clerk, his only idea being to draw
attention to the fact that some mistakes
had occurred in regard to exhibits in
criminal ensrs, and ho hoped to guard
Hgainsta recurrence of such errors; that
he does not care who keeps the exhibits
so they are kept safely and may be pro
duced promptly when wanted.
It is not clear that the statute of Feb
ruary 2, 1872, is conclusive of the matter,
the Judge said, aa the code, w ich was en
acted subsequently, may supersede the
earlier enactment.
Mr. Curry declares that hereafter papers
and exhibits will De allowed to^no out of
his possession only on order of the court,
and that the person receiving such articles
will be required to receipt for same. â¢
Wants to Change His Name.
Wenzell Adami, a native of the town of
Nleder Weisel, in the county of Hesaen Darm
stadt, Germany, has appiied to the Superior
Court for permission to change his name to
WcnzeU Adams. His reason for this request
ia that he wishes to conform to the Amer
ican stylo of nomenclature. He holds prop
erty under the name of Adiims, was nÂ«tural
lz.-d under that name ana is generally known
among his acquaintances as Adams.
ABOUT THE DIVINE
PERSONALITY
Dr. William T. Harris'
Lecture in Berkeley
Last Evening.
The Existence of a Personal
God a Certainty of Pailo
sophic Thought.
Objected to ths Theory That Nature
Is an Accident in the Divine
Purpose.
BERKELEY, Cal., Dec. 18.â The audi
torium of Siiles Hall was not large
enough to accommodate all who desired
to hear Dr. William T. Harris to-night on
"The Nature of the Divine Personality,"
and many were unable to gain a place in
the audience.
The visiting philosopher was introduced
by Professor Howison, president of the
Philosophical Union, who made a few re
marks on the subject of his address.
"Many persons in the East who are in
terested iv philosophy are looking to Cali
fornia ior a new revival of philosophic
thought," said Dr. Harris before entering
upon the discussion of his subject. "1
have the highest regard for Professor
Howison, in whose thinking I take more
interest than in that of any other living
philosopher."
The noted visitor began his lecture by
reference to the importance of concepts of
a first cause, which was declared to be the
basis of all religion, all philosophy and all
ethics. 'If the evidence of senses
alone ia to be trusted there can
be no certainty oi immortality."
said Dr. Harris, "bnt man has aa inner
consciousness which sees more. Thi3
inner consciousness, presenting to us feel
ings, ideas, acts of will, leads us to widely
different, thoughts from those reached by
views only of the external mind. We can
not afford to look at the world only from
the objective point of view, but must in
cluue in our evidence the phenomena and
the characteristics and necessities of
mind.'*
After reviewing ancient doctrines of
theism Dr. Harris proceeded to explain
the Christian theism of the Hebrews.
'â¢The substance of their early faith is
found in the Psalms and in the early
prophets," said he. "It dealt with a god
external to nature, having infinite right
eousness and goodness and worshiped not
by forms and ceremonies, but by
human manifestations of righteousness
and goodness. In this idea ail exist
through the Almighty grace or kindness
in conferring life. It is loving kindness
rather than justice. Justice ia for the ma
ture being, loving kindness is for the im
mature. The Greek philosopher was the
source of the roots of Christian piety of in
tellect, which, as opposed to piety of heart
or faith or piety of will or right actions, is
denned as comprehension of God."
Dr. Harris declared that Plato was the
first philosopher to trace the ontological
proof cf God, establishing the necessity
for the existence of an independent being
by ihe fact of the existence of the de
pendent being.
"The modern doctrine of the correlation
of forces presupposes the existence of in
finite personality," continued he, "just as
the doctrine of a totality of dependent be
ings leads to the idea of an independent
being. If Spencer had had a mind like
Plato's he would have reached this con
clusion rather than arrive at the unknow
able that is the basis of his universe."
The lecturer reviewed Aristotle's addi
tions to the system of Piato, and closed
his remarks upon the Greek philosophers
with the assertion that "'Nothing needs to
be withdrawn from their conclusions,
more may be discovered, but all only
makes more certain the fundamentals ot
the philosophy of Plato and Aristotle."
Dr. Harris then proceeded to compare
the Greek and Hindoo conceptions of the
infinite, and to expound the Christian
doctrines of the holy trinity and of the
atonement. The doctrine of Father, Son
and Holy Ghost was elaborated philo
sophically and declared to contain a full
explanation of creation ana of tho world
or dependent beings.
'Individuality," said Dr. Harris in
speating of evolution, "begins to appear
in specific gravity in matter. It is found
all through creation, organic and in
organic, until in man it reaches the
height of moral action."
Dr. Harris affirmed the existence of a
personal God is a certainty of philosophi
cal thought. He objected to the con
ception of nature as identical with God
and also to the teachings of" some theo
logians that nature is but an accident in
the divine purposes.
"There arÂ« two orders of knowing
event?," said he. "The first is the sen
sual knowledge of externals. The second
is the knowledge of God, the most certain
of all our ideas, the light in all our sin."

THORPE PUT UP
A GRAND FINISH
Landed Old Strathmeath
Winner a Head Before
Little Cripple.
Doyle Was Neglected at 15 to 1
and Headed Out Some
Sprinters.
Three Favorites and an Assortment of
Second Choices Beatenâ Aquins
Won Easily.
There was some mixed racing at Oak
land yesterday, with jnst a small taste of
fog. The view of the first race was ob
scured by a thick mist notwithstanding
tbe fact that the course over the bay was
guaranteed proof from this annoying little
grievance to racetracks on this side, which
allows naughty jockeys to get their mounts
away from the post poorly and finish to j
their own liking. Three favorites and a j
varied assortment of second choices got
anchored tight and fast in the sticky go
ing, and the bookmakers' Christmas fund
for the benefit of aged and irrational indi
viduals no longer able to Dick a winner
was added to considerably.
The attendance was about up to the
average, Mr. Ferguson's starting was good
and the crowd arrived on this siie in time
to eat a 6 o'clock dinner.
For the first time since his arrival here j
Charlie Thorpe, tbe, crack rider,
gave a sample of what he is really capa- j
ble of doing in the saddlÂ°. In the last i
race of tbe day, over a mile, Charley had |
the mount on Greea B. Morris' old war
horse Strathmeath, whicn was & 7 to 5
favorite. When sent away, Woodchop- j
per sifted away in front, and by the way |
he climbed along it looked all over. In !
the stretch Strathmeath, Little Cripple
and Hermanita overhauled him, and a
most exciting finish ensued between the
trio named. By superb riding Thorpe
got the favorite over ihe line first a head
before Little Cripple, which horse was but
a snoot in front of "Dagjjie" Smith's
mare. Woodchopper was lapped on the
show horse, making it one of the best fin
ishes of the season.
Little could be seen of the fourteen
starters in the opening dash at five and a
half furlongs on account o' the fog. Arte
mus, the 11 to 5 choice, finished third.
Seaside, with 11. Isom up and a 5 to 1
charce in the betting, won easily at the
end from Banjo.
Twelve maiden two-year-olds lined up
in a six-*urlons sprint that followed.
Atticus, carrying tlie colors of Matt Storn,
was played from 11 to 5 down 10 8 to 5,
but swerving badly in the stretch was
headed out by boih Manzunillo and Vevo.
The winner, Manzaniilo, was quoted at 4
to 1 in the books.
Barney Schreiber's Aquina?, a prohibi
tive 1 to 6 favorite, had but to raise a
pallop to take the seven-furlong run from
Horatio. Ezell's Personne was third.
One-eyed, iil-ternpered Nelson let the
talent down with a perceptible jar over
the result of the fourth event at five ana a
half furlongs. He was backed from threes
dowr to 8 to 5, but could never snake his
company off nor get to the front, and he
failed to finish among the first three.
Bringing Doyie, a 15 to 1 shot, along on
the outside the last s-ixteenth, Slaughter
took the race by a length and a half from
Hueneme, another outsider. Walter J,
away from the post very badly, made a
grand run, capturing the show.
Notes.
The Follansbee handicap will be the j
feature of the card to-day.
There was considerable adverse criticism â¢
on J. Gardner's handling of Woodchopper <
through the stretch. The old horse is â¢
either a quitter or else Gardner is not a
jockey of the persuasive sort.
During tbe balance of tbe racing season j
at Oakland Track, by an order of the di- j
rectors, Starter Ferguson will use a recall
flag. Several horses heavily played have
been left at tbe post on sundry occasions, |
and there has been much grumbling. The i
order also says if a horse shows no disposi- |
tion to break a nay the judges will ring the j
bell and he will be left. Jockeys who de- |
velop a tendency to eet their mounts off '
barllv will be heavily fined.

THE- SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 19, 1896.
THAT MONUMENT
TO ROBBIE BURNS
Great Interest Being Mani
fested by American
Scots.
The Opposition Once Manifestsd
Is Turned to Indorse
ment
A List of Men Who, Forming a Com
mittee, Would Be Certain to Make
the Movement a Success.
The Burns monument, discussed at the
Burns banquet of ihe Caledonian Club
Thursday night, will certainly become a
speedy reality â speedy as such things go â
,if the prevailing enthusiasm of San Fran
cisco's American-Scots is sustained. The
American-Scotch blood in this. City is ex-
cellent stuff, and a list of the Scottisn
names to be found in the directory might,
transcribed and printed, serve for a list of
prominent citizens. Not one among
them, so far as learned, but is ready to do
what he can to help the monument
scheme along.
' Already very substantial offers of sub
scriptions have been made. D. McLen
nan,, contractor of the very beautiful
bridge in the park and owner of a granite
quarry, stands ready, he says, to furnish
$300 worth of granite for the base, and
certain liberal subscriptions made to the
fund when a similar movement was
started a few years ago are, it is confi
dently believed, still to be depended upon
and collectable.
The proposition to build a suitably
noble monument to the memory of Burns
was mooted in Scottish circles a few years
ago and immediately enlisted then as now
the warm support of not oniy all good
Scotchmen, but many others. It had the
misfortune, however, to meet the out
spoken opposition of certain newspapers,
who declared that the building of monu
ments in Golden Gate Park was not a
thing to b3 encouraged, as Golden Gate
Park ought not to be "turned into a ceme
tery" in this way. Besides, they said, if
monuments wore to be placed there they
should not be erected to the memory of
"foreigners."
This very naturally had the effect of
coolinjj the araor of those who stood
ready to subscribe their money tor wiiat
they deemed to be a work for the general
good. The iaeaof Burns being considered
a "foreigner" to any land or any people
was sutbuiently repugnant to the Scotch
men to place a decided check on their
plans. However, that opposition i 3 not
to be feared in this instance, as the news
papers referred to have already spoken
out in favor of tbe proposed movement.
The idea of ttie monument originates
â with the Caledonian Club, and that or
ganization declares a faith in its ability to
carry tne business through. The most
important step, it is held, is that of ap
pointing a committee of thoroughly sub
stantial and capable business men, mak
ing that committee permanent, chareed
with the responsibility of building the
monument. Tuat being done, iha Cale
donian Club will get behind the commit
tee and the work will go steadily for
ward, jusuad does the private enterprises
of any of the members.
That committee? Well, such men be
long to the club to be drawn upon lor
sucii service as John M. Duncan, Andrew
Wilkie, D. A. McDonald, Colin M. Boyd.
Angus McLoud, J. D. McGilvraj, John
McLaren, John Reed, James McNab,
James S. Webster, Dr. McLean, Dr. Mc-
Donald, Coionel C. W. Taylor, Hugh
Fraser, D. McFee, George Davidson, Y. C.
Lawson and a Jong list of others.
Members of the Caledonians say that a
commit tee composed of these men would
be a practical guarantee of the building of
the monument, and that the monument,
when built, would be an everlasting credit
to the City and joy to the people.
The Caledonians are in fine form to un
dertuke the enterprise, having nothing
cisc pressing upon them. When the plan
was under consideration before W. T.
Garrett & Co.. brass founders, made a for
mal offer of the bronze necessary for the
figure, and although Mr. Garrett has since
died it is thought the promise is still
good.
Colin M. Boyd at that time said he
would give $1000, and Colonel Harney,
who is also since dead, $250.
Tue committee will collect pictures of
Burns monuments in this and the old
country, and suggestions will be called for
from the best scuiptors of the country. It
is expected that the monument will cost
aboui $25,000.

chances of making headway with his ad
ministration prompted those in favor of
annexation to act quickiy. Minister
Cooper, while desiring to avoid expressing
himself too definiteis\ let it be under
stood that annexation was desirable and
that there was no doubt tnat many of the
leading people of Hawaii favored it. As
to ex-Queen Liliuokalam and her visit, as
sne now had no connection in any way
with the Government, it could take no
note of it.
The ex-Queen is expected to leave to
day for the ; East. She will ;go direct to
Boston, so it is given out, and not to Can
ton or Washington. In â¢ Boston - she .will
visit the relatives of her late husband.
Then where she will go is unknown, but
it. is stated ; that -it : will: probably be to
Washington and later likely to England.
There has been a mighty rivalry ; among
the ! railroads to get < the ex-Queen â > to go
over the different lines. The Southern
Pacific thought it had her, secured lor its
Sunset / li.rn.ted train, - but : the ex-Queen
finally thought she would like to no by
way 'oftOgcien.l'ben there was strife be
tween Snedecker of the ? Rio Grande and
Hitchcock rof " ; the ; Union Pac lie. > Hors
burgh of the Southern Pacific lias been do
ing nothing for a coii pit of days bat try
ing to Vet the dusky Queen-; to accept the
Southern Pacific route. The lady is a good
advertisement and they all want her. ' ;

REMEMBERED EARLY DAYS.
Death of Mugdalena Flores, Who Was
Burn Here in 1840.
With the rising of yesterday's eun passed
away Mag lalena Flores, who was born in
this City in 1840, long before ihe gold ex
citement broke out iv California and the
eyes of the world were turned on this
State.
She was the daughter of a man promi
nent in the days when the Spanish rule
was dominant in San Francisco, and her
family was wealthy and influential. With
tl)6 advent of the Americans the family
fonunes waned, and for years she had
been ijn far from affluent circumstances.
She died at '2B HincKley alley, where she
has for several years past resided with
relatives. Her death was caused by pneu
monia. Her husband died ten years ago.
Mrs. Flores remembered distinctly the
coming of the first bands of gold-seekers
into San Francisco Bay, and often told of
the exciting scenes of those days.
Her father's residence at that time Was
jusi north of the present site of tho pro
posed Hall of Justice.
FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS.

The garnishments which kept the purse
in chancery amount to not more than
$3000. This will leave $7000. According
to the testimony of Trainer Billy Smitti
Earp is to receive $2500. Then it is to be
presumed that General Barnes' fee will
not be less than $1000 for his eloquent de
fense of public morals and his scathing
denunciation of that brutal exhibition
known as a prize-light. He succeeded in
convincing the court that his client,
tharkey, had committed a felony, and
that he himself by attending the fight as
a spectator, was a law-breaker. But he
appeared at the fight as a private indi
vidual, whereas, in court he was in the
role of a lawyer, supporting and urging
the enforcement of the iaw. That was
easily worth $1000. It was reported that
Manager Lynch was to get $3000. That
would leave $500 to compensate Sharkey
ior receiving ttie cauliflower ear and the
poKe in the stomach, and to pay Drs. Lee
and Racan for their services.
If Earp gets $2500 he should cive Long
Green Lawrence at least $1000 foninduc
jng Gibbs and Groom to appoint nim
referee.
Civic Federation talk: has evidently had
very little effect on the principals of the
Jate gladiatorial liasco, for rxuh Fitz and
bbarkey, their managers and seconds are
fctill iv town. Sharkey still holds forth in
ail that splendor of blue suit and brass
buttons at the Windsor, and Bob at the
Baldwin attired in clerical carl).
Julian s-aid yesterday that he is yet un
determined about when the party will go
East. He doesn't intend to be "bluffed"
out of the City, anyway.
In regard to' the kinetoscope proposition
he didn't care to say much. If CorDett
was satisfied he and Fitzsimmons were
also. Nothing on their part should inter
fere with the contest.
Julian feel 3 pretty sore over the manner
in which the Cornishman was robbed. He
admits as much, but tiie fact that Sharkey
will get so little of the purse acts as a
scouring lotion to his indignation.
Several gentlemen interested in the
manly art have apuroached Julian with a
proposition to give Fitzsiinmons a com
plimentary benefit before he leaves for the
East. The pugilist and his manager say
iliat they are not in need find do not caro
to accept a complimentary benefit, but
when it was represented that the affair
was intended as a testimonial of ad
miration for the prowess of Mr. Fitzsim
mons Julian consented to take the matter
under advisement until this afternoon. If
the benefit takes place at all it will be held
in Woodward's Pavilion. Fitzsimmons
will give an exhibition of boxing and
there will be many other interesting feat
ures.
It has been suggest n d that the following
programme would insure a packed house:
Living pictures â Colonel Kowalfcky en
joying an esthetic snore.
Long Green Lawrence balancing a $10,000
sack of gold on hi* chin.
Wyatt Earp illustrating the method of
getting the drop on a prize-tiehter.
General Barnes convincing the court
that his client, Sharkey, had committed a
felony.
Dr. Lee's exposition of the value of io
dine in prize-ring surzery.
Manager Lynch explaining why he
worked for Sharkey for nothing.
Willie Hearst explaining why tbe Jour
nal blows hot and tne Examiner blows
cold on the fight.
Jake Raver lecturing on the necessity
ol having strong strings to a purse.
Other equally interesting features could
be introduced. But even the few attrac
tions suggested here would be sufficient to
pack tbe pavilion.
The Civic Federation will meet next
Monday, but it is not expected that any
steps will be taken to secure indictments
by the Grand Jury. ThÂ« federation al
lowed the Corbett and other prize-fights
to go on without protest, and it is not
likely that it will prove inconsistent with
its course by creating trouble now, after
the death-warrant of boxing-matches in
this City has been read.
Charles Wesley Reed, formerly the legal
adviser of the federation, resigned aoout
three months ago, when the federation j
declaied its intention of puttine a ticket
of itÂ« own in tbe field to be voted for at
the Xovemoer election. He saw in the
proposition a fatal blow at the usefulness
of tne federation.
He said yesterday that he had been one
of a committee appointed by the federa
tion to commit a misdemeanor by attend
ing the Corbett fighc for the purpose oi
acquiring the knowledge necessary for a
report upon the wickedness of pugiiism.
Mr. Reed enjoyed the bout immensely,
and the committee reported that it was a
most interesting spectacle and altogether
humane, neither of the pugilists having
been maimed for life or killed. The fed
eration dropped the matter then and
there and has allowed several prize
lights to be held here since that time.

Examiner, is a wonderful individual. His
remarkable career is being told and retold
throughout every hamlet, village and city
of these united States, and the exchanges
reaching this City bring new recitals daily
of his man-killing deeds.
Alfred H. Lewis, who writes for W. K.
Hearst's other scandalous paper, the New
York Journal, and whom the Examiner
recently published as "a man amont men
who knew men,'' has written much of
Wyatt Earp since the robbery of Fitzsini
mons. Tuls knowledge of Earp is irom
personal contact witli and study of thj
oully. Here are a lew extracts of Mr.
Lewis' opinion of "Long Green" Law
rence's associate and protector:
In the early eighties I was a neighbor of the
Earp family. Tiiey abode at Tombstone, Ariz.,
and did much toward making tnat hamlet a
thrilling place of residence-.
Wyatt Earp is one of four brothers, two of
whom, Julian and Warren Earp, are happily
dead and out. 'itie lour Earp brothers were
iibuudant about Tombstone in ISBI, 1882 and
1883. The community in 1883 assumed a
positive altitude toward ihe Eurps, ana pre
bcuted a front to tl'at .'lousehoid, liit.de up in
tne main of Winchesters and Colt six-shooters.
The Earps cui.struect this into a lack of con
liaence on the part of tne Tombstone public.
They resented it by shaking the dust of Tomb
stou-3 from their feet forever. They migrated
to the (Junnisou country. They were subse
quently run out of Gunuisou, and Wyatt and
Virgil Earu went to California, wnere Wyatt
tne otner 'night refereed the Fitzsimmous-
Snarkey light.
The lour Earps were named respectively
Virgii, Wyatt, Warren and Julian. 1 hey had
a sister, Jes>ie, who was with them in Tomb
stone. Of her, as novelists say, anon.
Virgil whs the oldest Earp. Wyatt the
wi>e<t, Warren the most foolhardy, Julian the
bravest and Jessie ihe most loving. As a re
suit Wvatt and Virgil lived to get out of
Tombstone, and the Utinnison in advance of
public opinion and the bullets that expiessed
it; while Warren was killed in Tombstone and
Julian in the Gunnison by Ike Clan ton, who
married his sister Jessie, and whom Wyatt
nnd Virgil subsequently killed at Socorroâ and
Jessie, the lovhik one, wedded Ike Clan ton,
witn w'>om her iour brothers had a blood leva
at tlie time.
Wyatt Earp, and, fer thut matter, all the
Eaijis, were gun-fighters and men oi prompt
and bitter courage. Wyatt Earp himself is
credited with ten men; one his own brother
in-law, Clamon. Every one of the Earps had
killed his menâ noi manâ and whs famed in
Tombstone and the Cochi-e country round
about as qualified to pull and make a. center
shot in less than ono-ienth oi a second. They
had all filed the sights irom their Kix-snooiers
when 1 knew them in '81 and 'S2; and,
eschewing the intervention of a trigger, were
prone to that prowess known ns "lanning"
their pistols in a tight, whereby a Coil's six
shooter becomes for the nonce a miniature
(Jailing.
Mr. Lewis has an interesting anecdote
to tell of Earp and his friends and a like
cias3 of ruffians who were their enemies.
He publisaes it thus:
It was a gala occasion in the Bird Cage
Opera-house in Tombstone. Sheriff Jiuimy
liehan, Ike (. lunton, Ringo and others ot the
cow-tnieves had boxes on one side, 'ihe
Earj.s, Curly Bill, Doc Holliday, Nixon and
others of the stage-robbers had boxes opposite.
When o;ie aide caeered a performer the others
hissud, aud as whisky flowed the spirits of
both gausts mounted.
AtUsi Ike Clanton took umbrage because
Nixon opposite reposed his boot on the rail of
his box. ClaatOD was too far nway for con
versation, so in testimony oi his condemna
tion of Nixon's tciion, he pulled his gun and
put a buliet through Nixon's one us ive foot.
It came off the box rail.
.Much good aud enthusiastic shooting en
sued. Twelve men were killed and wounded;
none oi the Earps, however. Williams, ihe*
confederate of Virgil and Wyatt Ettrp in
stage robbing, was badly shot up. He
expected to dl<; aud confessed. At this Wyatt
Earp and his three brothers, with others of the
gang, fortified themselves in an old 'doby
house on the edge of Tombstone. Behan and
tne' cow-thieves put in what lime they could
spare from laro bank and theft in besieging
them. The siege was a stand-off. At last War
ren Earpâ the loolhardy oneâ heeled himself
and came down from the 'doby fortress to play
laro bank. lie had just set a stack of blues on
the king open when a cow-thief listlessly put
a bullet through his head.
Thus died the first of the Earps. There was
no more fighting then, and at last the Earps
were driven out of Tombstone aud Into the
(Junnison. Their sister Jessie went with them.
Ike Clnnton, one of the Democrats ai d cow
thieves, followed them to Colorado and eloped
with Jessie. This was too much for the .Re
publican stage-robbing blood of Wyatt Earp
and his brotners. They pursued. They ran
Clanton and his bride into a mine tunnel.
The miners interfered. There must be fair
play. Ike Clanton offered to tight Virgil, Wyatt
or Julian Earp for their s-ster. Julian took it
up. The two shot it out with pistols and Julian
wss killed.
Tnus died the second Earp. Ike Clanton and
Jessie (nee Earp), lived iv peace two years.
Then Wyati Earp, Virgil Earp and Curly Bill
crossed up with Clanton. and there was an
other feast of the guns. Clanion was Killed
and took with him Curly Hill to the happy
hunting grounds. Wyatt Earp, when the
smoke blew away, wasalsofull of well-made
bullet-holes, but he got well.
It was then that Wyattand Virgil Earn lined
out for the slope. Just be;ore theyleit Tomb
stone the Earps killed the two McLiwries, hilly
Clantou and Frank Snllwell. It was these
killings rather than the Wells-Kargo hold-ups
that caused the puollc to lay lor them. Wyatt
Earp was prominentâ with his gunâ in the
Cochise couuty-seiit war between Tombstone
and Charleston of long ago.
His last public appearance in a gun play
was in the middle eighties, when Mayor Kelly
ran Luke Short out of Dodge City, and the
fugitive Luke summoned Wyatt Earp, Doc
Holliday, Charley Bassett, Bat Musterson and
Shotgun Collins to aid him in the recovery of
)ils own. They reinstated Luke and he and
Kelly divided Dodge City between them.
Is it a wonder, then, that Wyatt Earp
was selected as the most daring ana brazen
rascal to do the bidding of Sharkey and
the other shaiks of his entourage? A man
of nerve was required to boldly face an
audience of 10,000 people or more and
calmly decide contrary to all rules of right,
and actually rob a man of $10,000.
But this man is not through yet with
such a flagrant steal. Hib very boldness
and effron.erv have rushed him into a po
sition where he may have to face a charge
of perjury based upon his testimony given
before Judge Sanderson on Tuesday last.
He was undergoing crosÃ-examination
by Attorney Kowalsky, and in regard to
matters thut transpired in the ring within
view of the thousands of spectators who
shouted tliem*elves hoarse in calling his
attention to them he denied seeing any
fouling by Sharkey, or even of hearing
Martin Julian address the house saying
that he objected to Earp as a referee be
cause he was reported "fixed' 1 to give the
fight to Sharkey.
Here is the testimony as taken down by
a stenographer:
Q.â Did you see Sharkey on several occa
sions, when they clinched, grab Fitzsiinmons
by the leg.
A.â No, sir; never. If Mr. Sharkey had
caught Mr. Fitzsimmons *by the legs and
wanted to throw him he could have thrown
nim plumb off the stage, and anybody knows
that.
Q.â At the time when we claim that Sharkey
not once, but half a dozen times, caught Fitz
simmons around tne Jegs and tried to throw
him, did you not hear the audience holler,
"Shame! Foul!"
A. â No, I did not. Sharkey never caught
Fitzsirnmons around the legs "at all. Neither
did he foul Flizrtmmons in any way during
the contest. Fitzsimmons was fouling Sharkey
all the time.
Qâ You were in the ring, were you not,
wliei; Mr. Julian went to the ropes accompa
nied by Jordan, and w ho quieted the audience,
and when Julian made home talk to the peo
ple there?
A. â I think so; yes, sir.
Q.â Did you hear him say that they under
stood that the referee was crooked aud that
they did not expect a fair decision, and that
they could not proceed with the contest un
less they nad a lair referee, or auy similar
statement?
A.â No, sir; I did not. I did not hear him
open his mouth on that plntform.
Q.â Did you see him walk first to the east or
Lark in-street end of ihe ring, accompanied by
Mr, Jordan, who held his hand up for silence,
alter which Mr. Julian addressed the audience?
A.â No, fir; I did not. I heard Mr. Jordan
made ail this statement, but not Mr. aulian.
Mr. Jordan was master of ceremonies, and he
was the man that made this declaration to that
eflect.
It is not likely that "Long Green" Law
rence's bodyguard will be able to dodge a
Grand Jury indictment in the premises as
he dodges bullets in Arizona.
Governor Budd'a Denial.
Governor Budd has emphatically denied
that he intends making any changes in the
personnel of the Board of Health, as has been
stated. He expresses himself as satisfied with
the present administration of the department,
the members ot the board being his anpointees.
All of the physicians deny having received any
intimation thtt they are to be remove!.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 19, 1896.
MEN WHO TRAVEL
OVER THE STATE
They Propose to Care for
Their Aged and
Indigent.
Commercial Tourists Who Have
a Noble Purpose in
View.
Under Their Auspices a Grand Fair
Will Be Held in the Pavilion
Next Year.
There are four orders of traveling sales
men on this coast, and an effort is being
made by the Pacific Coast Commercial
Travelers' Association to have them com
bine early next year for the purpose of
charity to themselves and theirs.
Tne idea is to nold a fair in this City
sometime in April or May, 1897, say, at
the Mechanics' Pavilion, after the pattern
cut out by the Eastern association, whose
fair at Madison Garden, New York, was
held up to two weeks aeo. That social
assembly was to raise $150,000 to build a
home for the aged and indigent commer
cial travelers, and the business world
turned out to assist in the affair. It was
an overwhelming success.
OFFICERS OF THE ASSOCIATION.
The local affair has no such high aims
as the Eastern travelers had, still the
coast travelers want to raise sufficient
money to endow beds in every hospital on
the Pacific Coast, so that the unfortunate
or improvident commercial man may be
sure of proper care should he be taken ill
at any place away from his home.
This Is a beautiful sentiment which the
association wishes to put into practice.
Ben Schloss, one of the directors of the
Pacific Coast Commercial Travelers' Asso
ciation, has been traveling through the
East to strengthen himself in the details
of the fair held there, so as to inculcate its
best elements into the one to be held here.
At the annual meeting to be held Decem
ber 31 in the Columbia Theater, Mr.
SchlosÃ will tel! all he learnea, and one of
the first requirements of the candidates
for election as directors will be to work
out the "hospital endowment" proposi
tion. Committees will be appointed to go
ahead with the affair, and their reports
will bo made on the last Saturday of Jan
uary at the Grand Hotel.
There is probably no institution wider
in scope in this State than is the conglom
eration of travelers' associations. The
Pacific Coast Travelers' Association (in
corporated) organized fourteen years ago.
It disorganized after six years and a new
organization was incorporated July 15,
1891. The latter is the largest ever formed
on this coast and numbers nearly 1000
members.
The United Commercial Travelers' A
ssociation in Columbus, Ohio, has several
strong organizations in this State.
There are also the two branches of the
Travelers' Protective Association, whose
members are rapidly increasing. This is
purely a business institution, the mem
bers carrying $10,000 insurance policies
each and are entitled to siclc benefits.
Four months ago the San Francisco trav
elers organized as a distinct institution.
All these concerns, singly and col
lectively, are made Dp of tne cleverest and
brainiest men in social and business cir
cles. Wherever they go they carry sun
shine and prosperity, for no place ever
prospered or was happy where the com
mercial man has not opened his sample
cases.
They propose now to do something for
their sick and indigent workers who have
fallen by the wayside while toiling, that
they may be cared for comfortably in
their old age. There is no doubting that
the fair to be held here will be encourag d
by liberal patronage when the time coiues
for it to be held.
DEATH FROM A HEADACHE.
Mrs. Christopher JMed Under Peculiar
Circumstances After a Day's Illness.
Mrs. Christopher, who resided at 501
Geary street, died last evening at 6o'cloct,
under peculiar circumstances. The de
ceased, who was taken ill yesterday morn
ing with a severe headache, took several
remedies, but being unable to find relief,
summoned Drs. Hubbell and Hughes.
The physicians administered drugs and
the patient seemed to be improving. In
the evening, however, she collapsed and
died.
The Coroner was notified and an autopsy
will cc held.
The attending doctors are of the opin
ion that, in her anxiety to relieve her
sufferings, Mrs. Christopher took some
powerful drug that affected the action of
the heart, and finally caused death.
A "PRISONER ALARM."
Architect Miea'n New Device for
Doing Away With Jail-Brnaklng.
Frank T. Shea, architect of the munici
pal building, has a device which he pro
poses to place in that edifice. It is an in
genious system acting as does a burglar
alarm and is attached to the bars of the
cells in the prison :n the building. Should
a prisoner succeed in cutting one of those
bars or in any manner tamper with the
fastening of the cell in which be is con
fined the fact is immediately known to
the turnkey.
So perfect is the system said to be that
the slightest movement of the prisoner
toward surreptitiously vacating his apart
ment is instantly registered in the office
of his keeper. Mr. Shea believes that he
has solved the question ot successfully
holding folks of lawless tendencies where
they may be found when wanted tfy the
trial courts.
JACK DAVIS' BENEPIT.
The Antics or Two Inexperienced
Youths the Only Amusing
Feature.
From a financial standpoint the benefit
to Jack Davis at the Grove-street Theater
last night was not a success, as there were
barely a hundred persons in the house.
The entertainment consisted of a tour
round bout between Abe Roberts and Jack
King, one of four rounds between Patsy
McCabe and Alex Pantazes, a friendly
sparring match of three rounds by Charles
Rochette and "Yank" Savage and a final
cuffing match of three rounds Dy Jack
Davis and Denny Mailer. None of the
bunts were worth description.
The audience was kept in a good humor,
however, at the expense of a fractional
witted youth named Kemp, who was in
duced "to box without wearing his shoes
and to rack his throat in a proud en
deavor to render some of the latest pop
ular airs.
Lon Agnew acted as timekeeper and
master of ceremonies, being assisted by
Tom Sharkey' s bulldog. The bulldog
came without Tom.
Another diversion was created by some
joker coaching McCabe, who is an inex
perienced youth just arrived from trie
Emerald Isie, to step to the front of the
stage and very teriously challenge the
world at his own weight.
FOUR NEW STARS.
A Quartet of Club-AVielders Added to
the Police Force.
The Police Commissionejs last evening
made appointments to the force as fol
lows: Bernard Judge, a native of San
Francisco, a carpenter, aged 29 years;
William Isaac?, native of San Francisco,
a molder, aged 30; George F. Scott, native
of Ireland, a carpenter, aged 35; John
Jordan, native of Canada, carpenter,
aged 31.
LABOR COUNCIL MEETING.
Reports Were Received From Various
Branches of Trades.
The San Francisco Labor Council met
last evening at 1159 Mission street, J. Hill
presiding and Ed Rosenberg secretary.
There was comparatively little business of j
importance on hand. Reports were re- j
ceived from trades from the printers, sail- â 
ors, pattern-makers, theatrical employes
and horseshoers, all of whom reported
business dull.
A report of the execntive committee
concerning the lnbor directory was
adopted, and the directory will soon be
out â in about a week. A pamphlet was
received from the California Labor Con
vention, showing amendments to and
substitutes for labor bills. The provi
sions of various bills were considered and
discussed.
BOVEE HAS ARRIVED.

George Bovee, the champion profes
sional cyclist of s Texas, arrived here late
last night from El Paso, and expects to re

local cracks will be watched with a good
deal of interest. H9 has been expected
for some time.
Will Knippenberg of Los Angeles came

tained by the Bay City Wheelmen last
evening. .

POPULIST POINTS
FOR A CHARTER
Three Boards to ' Look
After the City's In
terests.
Civil Service to Dominate All
Subordinate Appointive
Oificers.
A Supervisor by Lot for Each As
stmbly Districtâ Ordinances to
Be Referred to the Pople.
Taylor Roerers (chairman), J, Asbury
Johnson, Urban A. Lewis, George D. Gil
lespie and J. A. Anthony, a committee
representing the People's party of San
Franoisco, have prepared the fundament
als for the proposed new charter of San
Francisco.
Their report, among other new matters,
provides that the Mayor shall have the
right to suspend an elective officer pend-
I ing investigation, and on conviction of a
I felony in the Sujerior Court shall abso-
I lutely remove him from office. The
Board of Supervisors shall consist of as
many members as there are Assembly
districts within the City, and each mem
ber shall be assigned by lot to an Assem
bly district as the special representative of
its interests before the board. It may act
as a court of impeachment for charges
against any elective officer.
No ordinance shall bo in force until
sixty days after its passage, and if within
that time 20 per cent of the taxpayers on
j ilie taxroll shall in writing petition the
I board therefor, such ordinance shall be
I suspended and shall thereafter at the next
1 municipal election be submitted to a pop
nlar vote for approval or rejection. If a
majority of the voters shall be in favor
the ordinance s-hnll go in force within ten
days after the declaration of the official
count thereon. Otherwise it shall be null.
All public work shall be done under the
superintendence of a Board of Â±*Ã¼blic
| Works.consisting of seven Commissioners.
I All work must be done by tne day and not
| by contract, and all material shall be
i bought in the open market.
Before any work, the estimated cost of
which as a whole exceeds $10,000,
shall be finally ordered, a brief state
ment of the work, the material proposed
and the estimated cost shail be published
in the official paper for a period of thirty
days.
Any ten taxpayers within that period
shall be entitled to file written objections
to such work and shall have the right to
appear before such board at a time named
for the consideration of the objections 10
offered. If, in the board's opinion, such
objections are untenable, the worn: may
tht-reupon be prosecuted to completion.
Meetings must be held three days in each
week, and each Commissioner shall devote
the whole of his tima exclusively to the
business of the municipality.
The executive aepartment shall consist
of the following twelve divisions:
Finance, Health, School, Police, Firo,
Street, Law, Election, Treasury, Civil Ser
vice, I'arks, Public Utilities, over which
of each division there shall be an elected
Superintendent, who shall appoint all
subordinate officers from candidates certi
fied as having passed the examination re
quired for the service. Each Superintend
ent be an expert in the matters per
taining to his division; thus the Superin
tendent of Streets must be a civil engi
neer, the Superintendent of Schools a
practical teacher, and so on.
The duties of the Superintendent of
Civil Service shall be to classify the'
various employes of the City, conduct ail
examinations of applicants, issue certifi
cates therefor and, on the requisition of
any division, certify successful candidates.
He shall in the often market purchase alt
supplies (for current use and not used for
repairs or construction of public build
ings) for each and every department of
! the City government and certify to the
bills therelor.
The Superintendent of Public Utilities
shall have charge of all electrical and
telephone and other appliances belonging
to the City and superintend all gas or
water sold or owned by the City and
supervise any and all private companies
engaged in Belling light or water to the
public. He collect all City taxes.
These Superintendents and the Mayor
shall constitute a Boa:d of Administra

THE WASP IN GOLD LETTERS.
Its Christmas Number a Complete Al
bum of San l'rauoisco in Winter
Aspect.
The Christmas Wasp, of which we have
before us an advance copy, is an artistic
piece of work, perhaps the best holiday
number ever issued by it.
The title page contains the following
words in gold letters: "An album of San
Francisco, her people, pleasures, magnifi
cent bay and beautiful park in winter
aspect."
To the left of this inscription is a clev
erly executed representation of the paper's
emblem holding the pencil in an appro
priate position.
San Francisco is famous the world over
for its weeklies, especially the W r asp,
which recently celebrated its twentieth
year. It is the oldest colored cartoon
paper in the United States, and the good
work performed by it during the iecent
campaign was not only recognized at
home, but throughout the Eastern States.
In the November Review of Reviews ap
peared the Wasp's famous campaign car
toon depicting the price of labor in free
silver countries. The great magazine
speaks of it as the most convincing picto
rial argument of the political controversy.
In the number which appears this
morning is succint information by well
known writers concerning our people, ac
companied by beautiful illustrations. It
is just the thing to send East or abroad to
friends, as showing the grandeur of our
city, Day, etc., in winter.
In connection with the issuance of the
Christmas Wasp the enterprising proprie
tor has decided to present energetic news
boys with watches. New subscribers will
also be made the recipients or first-class
watches during 1897.

There is considerable talfc amone
the members of tne committee of
fifty of having Mayor-elect James

standing in the community will give i
weight to the opposition of the committee i
to the bill.
Mr. Phelan i 3 understood to be willing (
to go if the duties of his office can be so i
arranged as to allow him to be absent for i
the necessary length of time. I
