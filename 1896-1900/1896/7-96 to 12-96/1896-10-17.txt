DOCTRINE OF TRUE PATRIOTISM
Visitors to Canton To d How the Coun
try Will Prosper With Sound
Currency and Settled Tariff.
CANTON. Ohio. Oct. 16.â The first dele
cation to call on Major McKiniey this
morning was a party of business men,
farmers and miners from Pennsylvania.
They repiesented Bradford, Easton, Car
bon, Northampton, Luzerne, Lehigh and
Wyoming. Congressman J. H. Cording
otTonawanda acted as spokesman.
in responding Major McKiniey spoke at
some length upon the advantages to
miners of a settled tariff policy backed up
by a sound and stable currency. These con
ditions, together with the return of confi
dence to the business world, he said,
would restore the prosperity to the coun
try that had been destroyed by the enact
ment of the Wilson tariff bill. Continu
ing, he said:
The way to restore confidence Is to have a
settled tariff policy that will enaDle the man
ufacturers of this country to know just what
their competition will be abroad and then
prepare for it. Then, more than that, we
want to have a currency in this country that
is unchangeable in value and equal to the
b st money in the world. We want everybody
in and out of this country to know that we are
not a nation of repudiators [applause], and
that we do not mean either to cheat ourselves
by a short dollar or anybody else. [Great ap
plause.]
Our dollars hereafter, as now, as ever since
1879, shall continue to be worth 100 cents
each in gold, and not only at home but
wherever trade goes. What you want is the
dollar you have now, and the only trouble
that you are not getting enough of them is
because you have not work enough. Now.
whatever will put our people to work is the
true, patriotic and American policy, and the
one by which your votes on the third day of
November you can determine upon, :or no
body determines anything for the American
people but the American people themselves.
West Virginia sent a fine delegation of
100 voters to Canton. They came frow
the oil-producing town of Sisterville and
the counties of Welset and Tyler. The
Elkins Invincibles, a marching club,'4OO
strong, wearing old gold .hats and coaxs.
w*re with the delegation and formed an
important part of it. R. L. Moore and P.
A. Shanor made short, spirited addresses
to Major McKiniey. In replying to their
remarks, Major McKiniey made one of tbe
most exhaustive speeches to Southern
voters that he has delivered this campaign.
1 1 was received with marked demonstra
tions of approval. He said:
The policy of protection to American farms,
industry, enterprise and labor, is a broad N*
tional policy. It has not & tinge of sectional
ism in it; it is sound in truth and wholesome
In practice. It is not narrow and provincial, but
wide in its blessings and its benefits, always
promoting industrial growth, serving National
ends, rewarding individual efforts and ad
vancing the just aspirations and hopes of the
American people. It is the doctrine of true
patriotism; the welfare of our country and
countrymen first; our homes and our families
firstâ an ardent, sincere and genuine American
ism that loves our flag better than any other
and would rather subserve our own interests
than the interests of any other people or of
any other nation. It is not the plea of one
State against another, or one group or section
of States against another; tut it it, lor the
benefit of allâ a policy that injures no Ameri
can interest, but promotes tnem all.
"It is only perfect when universal," and it
is only under this principle that the Republi
can party advocates its restoration. The wny
some of your orators used to talk to you was as
if the tariff was a good thing for the Ohio
farmer and laborer, but a post ive detriment
to the West Virginia farmer and laborer; as if
it could benefit the miner of Pennsylvania,
but injure the miner of West Virginia; as if
the wheat and grain grower in Kansas or the
beet-producer of Nebraska would grow rich by
its operations and the cotton and sugar plant
ers of Texas Hnd Louisiana become Impover
ished under it. Time and again you have
heard them declare that while protection
might be a good tbing for New England, it
â¢was a cmse to the West and the South. You
know better now, after having had three years
and a half experience under partial free trade.
[Applause.]
In vain did Repub;ican speakers and papers
remonstrate against this madness, but of no
avail; and so the people gave it a trial. With
what result? Is it not true that partial fr<e
trade has injured us, one and all? Is it rot
true that partial free trade has injured every
interest and every industry in West Virginia?
Have not the people and the Government
grown steadily poorer under its destructive
operations? Have not both producer ana oon-
Burner been Injured? The Southern, in com
mon with all the other States, steadily ad
vanced under the protective system. If there
was a difference between them and the North
ern States, it was in their favor steadily every
year from 1870 to 1890, simply because their
resources were greater and their development
more general and rapid.
Saturday promises to be the liveliest day
of this campaign in Canton. Thirty
delegations are scheduled to arrive
here to-morrow and the visitors will begin
to come as early as 5 o'clock in the morning.
The indications are that more than 25,000
people will come to Canton to-morrow
and that Major McKiniey will have to
make no fewer than twenty-five speeches.
ARE OPENING VOTES DAYLY.
But the Republican Leader* Will Not
Take Any . Chance*,
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. : 16.â A delegation
of Indiana Republicans from Crawfords
ville, Logansport, Veedersburg, Delphi,
ITerre Haute, Brazil and Rockville, came
to Republican National * headquarters ; to- ;
day to see Committeeman Durbin with a
view to Retting ex-President Harrison to
visit that section of Indiana during bis
stumping tour of Indiana. Mr. Durbin
could do nothing for them because he haa
received General Harrison's ultimatum
that his tour must be confined to four
days, and the route decided is considered
The San Francisco Call
by the National Committee to be the one
where tbe mest good can be done for the
ticK^t. The delegation brought the news
that a thirty days' private poll shows a
net gain of 21,000 in fifty- four counties
over the vote of 1892. The gains in the
remaining thirty-eiubt counties are esti
mated at 15,000, making a total of 36.000 to
offset the 7000 Democratic majority of
four years ago. To* last poll by the State
Committee showed larger gains than this.
Hon. Robert T. Lincoln will speak in
Duluth October 21, Minneapolis October
2S and St. Paul October 24. Hon. John
W. Keifer of Ohio, ex-Speaker of the
House of Representatives, has been as
signed to Illinois for three meetings tne
last week of the campaign. Half a hun
dred other speakers of lesser note were as
signed to-day for the wind-up rallies
throughout the West.
General William Osborne, secretary of
the Eastern headquarters, was a visitor at
headquarters for the first time to-day. He
said the campaign work in the Eastern
States was in such shape that he could
afford to leave it for a short time and ex
amine the operations of the Western head
cfuarters. He was confident the East
would vote solid for McKiniey.
Committeeman Payne said: "We are
working lor and will not be satisfied until
we secure 300 electoral votes for McKin
iey."
The last two weeks of the National cam
paign will be devoted by the National
Committee and its army of workers to car
rying out Mr. Payne's predictions. The
efforts of the party will be directed now
toward getting the full vote to the polls
and having them ca-t and counted. Spe
cial meetings will be held in every district
all over the country, the object being to
infuse general enthusiasm and a working
spirit to the last day. The shipping de
partment of the literary bureau will be
practically closed to-morrow night.
FACTIONS ABE HARMONIZED.
Republican* â of Louisiana Unite, but
I Key Meet With Obstacle*. \ .
NEW ORLEANS, ; La., i Oct. ? 16â After
everybody had given up the idea that they
would ever harmonize the regulars and
sugar-planter Republicans finally settled
their differences to-day and chartered a
train, upon which a delegation went to
tlie State capital to inform ' the Secretary
of State, in order that the proper changes
might be made' in printing the ballots.
The time to make changes expired at 5
o'clock this afternoon. On | arriving ', at
Baton Rouge the -reconciled .Republican
factions were confronted by an unlooked
for obstacle to their i wishes. . The Secre
tary of State refused to permit the with
drawal of any of the tickets on the ground
that the time for such action had expired.
The delegation, therefors, could do ! noth
ing. This will leave the two full tickets
in the field and lead to inextricable con
fusion. ,"'. - - l . '
Captain Donnelly, chairman of the
sugar - planters' campaign Â«. committee,
says:. -The action of the Secretary of
State will help rather than retard the
polling of a big joint Republican vote, for
the people will now see that the Foster
State government wants to steal votes." '
â  The . courts will be resorted to .in the
morning, so both factions say. ' ,

Veteran'- legion.
Washington, d. c; Oct. i6.â At this
morning's session of the Union Veteran
Legion resolutions were passed advocating
the election of McKiniey ani Hobari.
While the utmost reticence about dis
cussing the matter is exhibited by the
delegate* to the encampment it is sa d
that there was little debate on the subject
and tbat the resolutions were adopted
practically without opposition. It is un
derstood, also, that the pension p licy of
the present administration is condemned.

MONTREAL'S GREAT DISASTER
During a Corflagration in a Large
Stone Struc are Explosions In
crease the Horrors.
MONTREAL, Quebec, Oct. 16.â The
most disastrous fire in this city fora long
time occurred this afternoon, having its
beginning in the buil ling at 31 St. Peter
street, occupied by Gilmore & Co., im
porters of chemicals. As a result three
firemen are dead and a dozen more or less
seriously injured.
, The dead ire: Harry King of Station 1,
Carpenter of Station 7 and La Porte of
Station 16
The injured are: Captain Guturie and
Fireman Charpentier of Station 1, Cap
tain Morin of No. 3, Firemen Benoit and
Reynolds of No. 3, Gordon of No. 5,
Mirault and Carest of No. 11, Brancbeau
and Bennett oi No. 15.
' It is not yet possible to verify the report
that sixteen men were in the loft that
went down, and possibly another day will
be reached before the missing are defi
nitely accounted for. ThÂ«Â» fire is attributed
to the combustible nature of the stock
handled in the building, and once under
way the blaze spread with amazing ra
pidity.
Before the first apparatus bad reached
the scene and the hose could be laid the
flames from the fourth story of the build
ing were reaching far out into the center
of the street.
The building is a four-story stone struc
ture and was completely enveloped in fire
before the department began effective
work. The chemicals on the top floor
burned with the fury of a furnace, and
even after several streams had been
brought into play continued to blaze with
unabated fierceness. Clouds of dense
black smoke followed the flames as the
streams began to take effect, and the men
on the extension ladder were for a large
part of the time enveloped in huge clouds
of smoke.
The flames spread to Goldstein's cigar
factory and the smoke was seen coming
out of the windows of Kearney Bros.' tea
warehouse and the building occupied by
Johnston's Fluid Beef Extract Company.
The arrival of the water-tower was greeted
with an outburst of cheers by the enor
mous crowd of on-lookers and no time was
lost in getting it to work.
The fire then burst from a window im
mediately under a ladder upon which half
a dozen firemen were standing, thrusting
tne hose nozzles here and there. They did
not flinch, however, and another great
cheer went up as they dropped a step on
the ladder, placing themselves almost in
the flames with the hose still in hand.
Meanwhile another detachment was
busily engaged inside with axes breaking
out windows to let out smoke. No sooner
did the flames appear to be under control
in one place than they would break out
with redoubled fury in another. The n c
was got under control at 4 o'clock, but was
not subdued.
At 2:30 the floor of the upper loft in the
Gilmour buildine nave away without
warning and fell with a great crash. Six
teen men in all are said to have been in
the place at the time and as the smoke
cleared for a moment shrieks could be
heard.
At first the firemen were unable to get
inside, but finally the rescuers made head
way find the first victim reached was
Gordon of No. 5 station. He was wedged
down and apparently dead, but when
taken to the open air he revived somewhat
and was quickly placed in an ambulance
and taken to a hospital. Next came Fire
man Benoit of No. 3 station, who was not
resusticated before being taken away in
the patrol-wagon. Charpentier was the
third rescued and he was suffering in
ternally.
Captain Guthrie of No. 1 station was
also found in an unconscious condition.
He was taken to a hospital. A fireman
named Mirault of engine 11 was rescued,
but bis face was so badly crushed that at
first his identity could not be established.
Edmund La Porte was taken to the General
Hospital unconscious. David Bennett of
No. 15 and Saul Carest of No. 11 were re
moved to Notre Dame Hospital badly
hurt. Captain Morin was rescued badly
hurt. George Reynolds of No. 1 was also
taken to Notre Dame Hospital.
The bodies of Firemen King and Car
penter were recovered shortly after 10
o'clock to-night. T<.e men were buried
beneath many tons of debris and it took
several hours to get at them. Both men
bad evidently been killed instantly.
The most seriously hurt was Fireman
David Bennet of No. 15, badly injured in
ternally. At the General Hospital to
night tie wa's reported resting easily. All
the other men, who were only slightly
hurt, were released from the hospital and
sent to their homes.
All of the killed were married men with
families. La Porte, who was regarded as
one of the best men in tbe brigade, repre
sented Montreal at the international tour
nament in London last summer.
For the first twenty minutes of the fire
explosion after explosion occurred, caused
by the chemicals in the Gilmour building.
The loss will reach $150,000. The build
ings were all insured.
BURNED BY I\NCENDIARES.
Enemies of Bummer Cauie the Deatruc-
tion of Hi* Furniture Factory.
HOLLAND, Mich., Oct. 16.â The West
Michigan Furniture Company's factory,
owned by George P. Hummer, Democrat-
Union Silver candidate for Congress in
the Fifth District, was burned to the
ground to-night and is a total loss. The
fire is a clear case of incendiarism, and it
is supposed that it was started by one of
Mr. Hummer's political enemies. Tbe
loss, which is total, will amount to about
$125,000, with $100,000 insurance. The fac
tory was one of the largest in Western
Michigan and employed 400 men. Mr.
Hummer, the ow^.er of the factory, is
touring the State with Mr. Bryan.

PLOTTED TO WRECK A TRAIN.
One of the Men Interested in Cashing a
Life Insurance Policy Confessed in
the Mick of Time.
YORK, Nebr., Oct. 16.â Intense excite
ment prevailed here last night and to-day
over the statement made by Frank Mess
play tbat he and W. L. Lee, a well-known
business man, had plotted to wreck last
night's Burlington passenger train some
where east of town. The train readies
here at 11:40 in the night and Messplay
made the statement an hour before the
time for the arrival of the train. A crew
was immediately dispatched to inspect
the track, but found no obstructions. The
supposition is that they wera secretly re
moved. Messplay and Lee were arrested
and lodged in jail for the night. This
morning Messplay made the sensational
statement that Lee held an accident in
surance policy on A. Bissell, a passenger
on the train, and bad deliberately planned
to ditch the train with the hope that Mr.
Bissell would be killed in the wreck. Lee
denies the story. He has been bound
over for trial. All are prominent and tbe
affair has caused a great sensation.
JUSTICE IN MARYLAND.
Rapid Trial, Conviction and Sentence o/
the Murderer of a Defenseless
Woman.
BALTIMORE, Md., Oct. 16.â One of the
quickest murder trials on record took
place yesterday at Upper Marlboro, in
Prince George County. James Smith was
arraigned, demanded jury trial, was
granted it, and was promptly convicted
and sentenced to death before the court
adjourned.
The prisoner greatly facilitated matters
by pleading guilty. He was charged with
murdering Miss Margaret Drowns at Seal
Pleasant, a small place near Bennings
station. When arraigned and ordered to
plead Smith said in a firm and steady
voice, "Guilty of murder, but not of the
assault as charged."
His counsel asked for a jury trial, and it
was quickly under way. Four witnesses
for the State were examined.
The prisoner was put on the stand and
in answer to a question said :
"On the evening of July 28 Miss
Drowns and me had a quarrel. I knocked
her down, choked Her, went downstairs,
got a knife, returned, took the knife and
cut her throat. That's all there was to it."
The jury remained out about fifteen
minutes and returned a verdict of guilty
of murder in the first degree.
The Judge then pronounced the death
sentence.
TO BID ADIEU TO SATOLLI
Distinguished Catholic Prelates
Gather at the Fifth- Avenue
Hotel.
Their Meeting May Also Have Some
Bearing on Selecting Bishop
Keane's Successor.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 16.âArch
bishop Ireland of St. Paul and Bishop Me-
Goldrick of Duluth arrived at tne Fifth
avenue Hotel this morning, swelling the
number of distinguished Catholic prelates
who have come to bid adieu to Cardinal
Satolli, who sails for Rome to-morrow
morning.
Though the visit was timed on account
of the Cardinal's departure, the assemblage
of church dignitaries is also on account of
the meeting of the directors of the Wash
ington Universiiy. It has been thought
in certain quarters that there would be a
"caucus" regarding Bishop Keane's suc
cessor at the university, but so far as can
be learned no such caucus has been held,
though the matter has been discussed in
an informal way. This atternoon to a re
porter of the United Associated Presses
Bishop McGoldrick said:
"It is folly to predict what will be the
outcome of the meeting of the Archbishops
of the United States and of tne directors
of the Catholic University, which is to be
held in Washington. All talk of a pro
gramme is merely conjecture and guess
work. As to Bishop Keane's successor it
is idle to make predictions."
Archbishop Ireland laughingly said:
"Oh, don't put my name in the papers at
all. I cannot be induced at present to talk
on any topic for publication, not even on
the weather. Really, I must beg to be ex
cused."
This evening all the distinguished pre
lates attended the final reception in Car
dinal Satolli's honor in Brooklyn.

Fearful Fxperience of the
Battleship Indiana in
Hampton Roads.
Big Guns Break Loose and
Charge Furiously Over the
Deck During a Gale.
HAWSERS SNAP LIKE THREAD.
Awful Batt'e With the Cannon While
the Waves Swept Over
the Vessel.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 16,â The
battle-ship Indiana, which is with the
North Atlantic squadron off Tompkins
vilie, will go to the navy-yard in Brooklyn
as scon as orders come irom Washington.
New gearings will be put on the turrets in
"place of that which was broken on the
recent trip from Hampton Roads.
The Indiana encountered a fierce gale
between here and Hampton Roads last
March and the gearing was found to be
not strong enough for an emergency.
The department was notified and new
gearing was provided. This has been
lying in the navy-yard for several months
because the Indiana has been so busy with
drilling, that she has not had time to stop
and have it fitted.
A reporter saw Captain Evans, com
mander of the Indiana, aboard his ship.
Captain Evans explained in detail the
trouble the Indiana has just bad. He said :
"Soon after we left Hampton Roads,
Monday, all four of the 8-inch turrets
broke loose at once from their gearing.
The sea was very rough and the great roll
of the ship made the clamps inadequate
to stand the strain. That was about 2
o'clock in the afternoon. We went to
work with five-inch hawsers to tie the guns
up. About 2 o'clock the next morning the
forward guns snapped their hawsers and
got loose again. The storm was then very
severe and tne ship was rolling at an angle
of 36 deg. The decks were flooded with
water and this, with the pitching of the
ship, made working on deck very danger
ous. It was black as ink and we could not
see how to get about in order to head the
sea. We could only guess.
"To make matters woTse the forward
13-inch gun turret got loose aad the enor
mous guns began thrashing about in full
command of the deck. The 13-inch gun
knocked great dents in the scupper pipe,
broke stanchions and threatened to tear
away the entire superstructure.
"It was very dangerous to work in that
storm. I was afraid of losing two or three
dozen men and if I had not the best crew
in the world I don't know how we would
have come out. We fastened a five-inch
hawser on the 13 - inch gun and it
snapped like a cotton string. Then we
secured a five-inch wire cable. The sea
took it and 100 fathoms went overboard.
"Then I was afraid the cable would tool
the propeller, so we had to stop every
thing and recover it. The ship was then
proceeding at about five knots. We got
it after a while and finally caught the big.
guns with an eight-inch hawser and tied
them securely to the superstructure. It
was an awful job, thouerb, and we were in
danger of being washed overboard every
minute. All during the work the deck
was completely flooded.
"It was 6 o'clock in the morning when
we got through. The whole crew had been
at work all night. The rest of the fleet
had gone ahead, but it put about and re
gained our position."
It will take about three weeks, Captain
Evans said, to have the new gearing
put in.

the Madison-square notification meeting.
in New York, he Bpoke twenty-seven
times. To-day he added twenty-five
speeches to his list. They were delivered
at MusKegon, Holland, Fennville, Bangor,
Hartford, Watervliet, Ann Arbor, Niles,
Dowagiac, Decatur, Lawton, Kalamazoo,
Battle Creek, Marshall, Albion, Jackson
(two). Rives Junction, Leslie, Mason and
Lansing (three).
Most of these speeches were longer than
any of those he gave while making the
trip to the notification meeting. At nearly
every place where Mr. Bryan's special
train stopped there were bie crowds. Ex- j
cursionists came by train to all the larger
towns. Farming people drove into the
speaking places in all manner of vehicles.
Many people brought flowers to present to
the nominee and his wife, an.l they were
fairly overwhelmed with roses, chrysan
themums and other varieties.
At several points in the vicinity of
Kalamazoo gigantic bunches of celery,
surrounded by fragrant hothouse blooms,
were sent to them. McKinley badges
were not nearly so numerous among Mr.
Bryan's audiences as they were yesterday.
In fact, they were conspicuous only at a
few of the stops. The enthusiasm, too,
was heartier tnan then. At some places
the people made the wildest effort to get !
near the candidate in the hope of shaking I
hands with him, and many suffered in the
crushes. Fortunately, the day passed
without serious accident.
Once only did the candidate have a nar
row escape from physical injury. This
â was at Albion vhen the platform from
which he was speaking gave way with a
crash sending the forty or fifty people on
it to the ground. Mr. Bryan lighted on
his feet and resumed his remarks from a
baggage truck. Mr. Bryan began thed.\y
at Muskegon in splendid voice, but it be
came husky before he reached Lansing.
His speeches, as a rule, contained nothing
not said by him before, except that he
criticised William D. Bynum and threw
a dart at Chairman Laiuerbach of the
New York County Republican Commit
tee.
So dense were the people packed in the
public square and Liberty square in Jack
son t is evening that Mr. Bryan was un
able to reach the stand from which he was
expected to speak. It was just growing
dark when his train reached tne Michigan
Central depot. The streets were crowded
with Jaeksomtes and excursionists, and
the four white horses that drew the car
riages in which Mr. and Mrs. Bryan were
seated were made to go turnugn the jam
only with the greatest difficulty. The
solid mass of humanity at the public
square was impregnable against the sallies
of the police. No entrance could be ob
tained for the candidate's carriage.
Finally the attempts to make a pa&sape
way to the stand were abandoned ana Mr.
Bryan stood up in the vehicle and made a
short speecti. Estimates of the size oj the
audience differ widely, but it was certainly
larger than any addressed previously dur
inz the day by Mr. Bryan. It comprised
Hi any worJttngmen just from their shops.
Going to Liberty square the four wnites
brought up against another bulwark of
human beings, and again it was impos
sible for the candidate to reach the speak
er's stand, and he was accordingly obliged
to deliver i is second speech from the car
riage, Leaving Jackson at 5:40 o'clock,
Mr. Bryan addressed a fair-sized crowd at
Leslie and a bigger one at Mason, and
reached Lansing at 7 o'clock. Excursion
ists from Grand Rapids, Detroit, Battle
Creek, Jactcson, Ann Arbor, Hilisdaie and
many other places came to Lansing to-day
to hear Mr. Bryan, and the capital city
was full of visitors when he arrived at 7
o'clock. Flambeau clubs, on horses and
afoot, escorted him from the train to
Mead's Hall, where he addressed a meet
ing exclusively for women.
The streets were crowded, and intense
enthusiasm was displayed as Mr. and Mrs.
Bryan, escorted by three ex-Mayors of
Lansing, Messrs. Buck, Warner and John
son, proceeded to the ball. The second
speech was delivered from a canopied
platform in Capitol square. Ten thousand
people were there when he came, but his
husky voice could not reach very far and
large numbers went away before he con
cluded to get places of vantage in front el
the Downey House, from the brilliantly
lighted balcony of which he addressed an
audience equal in numbers to that on the
Capitol grounds. Farmers, who came on
wagons and horseback, and excursionists
brought by trains composed a large part
of boih gatherings. Mr. Bryan's voice
Bounded clearer from his commanding
position on the Downey baicony and his
remarks were punctured by great cheering.
Then ha went to the armory, a spacious
building, and spoke to those packed within
its walls, and concluded the evening at a
big tent, which was also crowded. There
-was little if anything new in Mr. Bryan's
Lansing speeches. At the Downey House
he urged his bearers who were in favor of
free silver not to stay away from the polls
on election day, because tne result might
depend on the electoral Tote of one State.
Shortly after 10 o'clock Mr/Bryan's spe
cial train pulled out for St. Johns, where
he wiii begin his speech-making to-mor
row.

Treasury Building.
They Are Told in Plain Words
Why Free Silver Coinage
Is Not Desired.
WILL ALL VOTE FOR M'KINLEY
Cautioned Not to Be Ensnared by the
Vaporings of a Reckless
Agitator.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Oct. 16,-The
Wage-earners' Patriotic League of Mary
land to the number of 200 called on Sec
retary Carlisle at the treasury to invite
him to address them in Baltimore at his
convenience. The Secretary received the
delegation on the south steps of the treas
ury, where H. K. L. Johnson, the leader
of the delegation, made an address, in
which he said they wfcre Cleveland and
Carlisle Democrats who proposed to vote
for McKinley as the representative of
honest money. Postmaster WarfioU? of
Baltimore accompanied tba delegation.
Mr. Carlisle mounted a chair, and as he
did so some one called out, "Tell the
truth!" Ho promptly answered, "I will
try to." Then he said:
Gentlemen, I am very much obliged to you
for this visit, and very 60rry that it is not in
my power to comply with the request which
you have come here to make. The reasons why
lam not able to do so I think are tolerably
well understood by the public. Mv ousiness
has been so arranged as to permit me to miike
a few speeches In my own State, but under the
circumstances it would not be possible to go
elsewhere.
I cannot therefore accept your invitation to
go to Baltimore, but one or two things have
been suggested by the address just made about
which I would like to say a very few words to
you while you are here. If there ia a laboring
man in the United States who really believes
that the money he is new receiving tor his
wages is too good for him, that it is buying
too much food, too much clothing for hmis.-li
and his family, or that is paying rent fora
better house than he and his family ought to
live in, it is his duty to vote for toe free and
unlimited coinage of silver at the ratio of 1(3
to 1. [Cheers] If there is any laboring man
in the United States who has saved money out
of his earnings and deposited it in a savings
bank or building association or paid it on a
policy of insurance for the benefit of his fam
ily and who desire* to have it paid back to
him in a currency worth about half as much
as the money he paid out, he also ought to
vote for the free and unlimited coinage of sil
ver, for that will give him exactly what he
wants.'
On the other hand every man In the United
States, whether he works lor wages or not, who
wants to preserve the value of what he has
already accumulated and to insure the value
of what he may hereafter receive, ought to
vote against the free and unlimited coinage of
silver and for the maintenance of a sound and
stable currency in this country. [Applause.]
While every man who works lor wages or
gets A fixed compensation for his services must
be interested In the result of tbe pending con*
test, those who work for railroad companies
and other transportation companies, many of
whom reside in your city and some of whom
are perhaps here, have a special Interest in
tne quesiiou involved, because their em
ployers are confronted by a situation which
makes it impoesib:e to so increase wages as to
compensate lor the diminished purchasing
power of the moDey in which wages must be
paia if the policy of free coinage ot silver at 16
to 1 is adopted.
These companies cannot increase wages un
less they can increase the receipts from tin ir
business; they cannot increase the receipts
from their business unless they can increase
the charges for carrying freight aud passen
gers, at a if they should attempt to advance
the charges for carrying freight and passen
gers it Is safe to say that the very men, the
very people who Â«re now so clamorous for the
free coinage of silver would be the first to pro
test against it and to demand legislation to
prohibit it in all cases where such legislation
is not already existing. The man, therefore,
who works for a transportation company
would find himself the helpless victim of a
policy which diminished the purchasing
power of his wages about one-halt and com
pelled him to work on and on for the same
number of dollars he received before, thus de
stroying all hope of improvement of his con
dition.
But, gentlemen, the laboring men have their
fate in their own hands. They have the power
to protect wages against depreciation and to
protect their country against financial dis
turbances and ruin, and if they are as intelli
gent, as patriotic, as I believe them to be, they
will so exercise their power that no reckless
agitator will hereafter dare to approach them
in behalf of his wild and revolutionary scheme
of finance and civii government. [Applause.]
Now, gentlemen, I thank you again ior tnis
visit, end I tender to each and every one of
you my best wishes for his piosperity in what
ever calling he may hereafter be engaged.
Then the Secretary retired, amid ap
plause. ________________

TWO MURDEROUS BANDITS.
They Shoot a Saloon-Keeper at Galena,
Rcb the Cash- Drawer and Taka
to the Woods.
GALENA, 111., Oct. 16.â Bandits who
entered Bauer's taloon last evening, shoot
ing the proprietor and robbing the money
drawer, are still at large, notwithstanding
that,searching parties have been at work
since the perpetration of the dee.!. It was
about 5 o'clock last evening when two
men entered the saloon and at once com
menced ridding the place of its customers
by flourishing revolvers. A few shot 3
were fired into the air and the men left
immediately.
Approaching Mr. Bauer they command
ed him to throw up his hands, one bandit
striking him on the head, while the
other shot a bullet into his side near the
heart. The money-drawer was then
opened and the money taken. The shoot
ing attracted the attention of some of ths
neighbors, but co quick were the move
ments of the robbers that before any one
reached the saloon they had started out
through a rear door. Early this morning
a large party startea out armed with
rifles. Farmers have joined the posse, and
nearly 300 have spent the day searching
the woods, but without result. If they
are caught, they will undoubtedly be
lynched.
JOHN IMBODEN'S CRIMES
Kills His Invalid Brother, Sister
and an Aged Man on a
Missouri Farm.
Infuriated by Blood the Fiendish
Youth Tries to Slay the
Who'e Family.
PIEDMONT, Mo., Oct. 16.â News has
been received here of one of the most
atrocious crimes ever committed in this
part of the State. John Imboden, a young
man of 23 years of age, killed his sister,
his brother and an old man who made his
home with the ImDodens.
The Imbodens lived on Logans' Creek in
Reynolds County, near the town of Elling
ton, which was formerly known as Barnes
ville. Young Imboden was a man of
violent nature and was greatly feared and
disliked in the neighborhood. Last May
his wife and his two little daughters died
suddenly. It was suspected at the time
that they had been poisoned, but nothing
was ever done in the matter. Since his
recent crime it is believed now that there
can be no doubt that the three were mur
dered.
â¢ On Wednesday afternoon Imboden
quarreled with his 15-year-old sister,
and in a fit of uncontrollable anger
brained her with an ax he was using at
the time. Jacob Wihelm, an old man liv
ing with the Imbodens, saw the crime
committed and tried to save tbe girl,' but
only shared her fate, for the infuriated
man turned on him and crushed his head
with the weapon he had just used on the
defenseless girl. '
Then, frenzied by his bloody work,
youdg Imboden rushed into the house
seeKing more victims. He found his
20-year-old brother sick in bed, and
without hesitation murdered him. He
struck him on the head with the ax, and
then in fiendish glee hacked his body into
fragments.
He then attacked his two younger sis
ters, but the terrified girls fled from the
house and ran to where their father was
at work in a cornfield 300 yards away
from the house. He at once spread the
news among the neighbors and asked for
help to secure his son.
A constable quickly gathered a posse
and started to search for the murderer.
He had made no attempt to escape and
was found in the yard. He refused to sur
render when called on, and it was only
whin the constable had him covered with
a revolver and threatened to shoot that he
finally yielded. The feeling against the
murderer is so intense that lynching is
very probable.
ARESTED IN A POOLROOM.
Seventeen Women Gathered in During a
Kaid by the Police.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 16.â Yesterday aft
ernoon seventeen women and two men
were arrested by detectives from the Cen
tral police station in room 6 of the Ricar
do Hotel at ICB Clark street, and locked
up on a charge of being frequenters of a
poolroom. Unlike the women arrested
weeks ago on the southside, the prisoners
were not fashionable women, but were
from the middle class, apparently the
wives of small shopkeepers and artisans.
The arrest came about through the re
fusal of tie manager of tbe place to allow
a mulatto woman to patronize the place
alter she bad played once. She deter
mined to retaliate and swore out a war
rant lor the arrest of Ralph Doe on a
charge of keeping a gambling-room.
The warrant was Berved yesterday after
noon, when the place was almost full of
women. The officers secured possession
of the single ticker in the room, which
was connected with tbe wire, which ran
from the room through a window into the
alley, where it ran up a telegraph pole.
Four of the women walked to" the police
station. One of these was an old woman
with white hair, who asked the officers not
to compel her to ride in the patrol wagon.
At the station the women gave in most
cases what the police say are fictitious
names. Most of them took the matter of
thnir arrest philosophically, and made
efforts to secure bondsmen, but many
spent the time in crying and wonderinsr
what would become of them. Two of tne
women ate said to be the wives of police
officers.
BOTH BECAME INSANE.
Bad Affliction Befalls a Minister and His
Wife.
INDIANAPOLIS. Ind , Oct. 16â One of
the strangest cases in the history of this
city has just come to light. Rev. John W.
Milam, wno until within a few days has
been pastor of the Madison-avenue Metho
dist Episcopal Chnrch, and his wife have
both been declared insane. Mn. Milam is
an invalid, aud in the hope that he mip.ht
benefit her the pastor took up the study
of medicine. He was devoted to his wife
and his worry over her condition, com
bined with his intense study of medicine,
which be carried on without interrupting
his ministerial duties, proved too much
for his mind, which gave way under the
strain.
The first knowledge of his condition was
obtained when friends discovered him and
his wife shooting at imaginary figures,
which they claimed were annoying them.
This led to an investigation, which dis
closed that both were mentally impaired
and the necessary steps were made yester
day placing them under restraint. Mr.
and MrÂ«. Milam are middle-aged and the
parents of two children. Mr. Miiam has
served in the ministry for years and his
record is among the best.
VICTIMIZED BY
THE DETECTIVES
Kearney and Haines State
That Their Arrest Was
a Plot.
Had No Connection With Irish
Dynamiters and Were on a
Peaceful Mission.
ROUGH EXPERIENCE IN PRISON
Policemen Who Tried to Make Them
Break Down by Stories of Confes
sions by Informers.
NEW YORK, N. V.. Oct. 16.-John F.
Kearney and Thomas Haines, the two al
leged Irish dynamiters who were arrested
in Rotterdam September 13, arrived at
Hoboken this morning on the steamship
Werkendam. Besides a few personal
friends there was no one on the pier to re
ceive them. Kearney's wife did not re
ceive telegraphic notice of the vessel until
8 o'clock, and she was not present. Kear
ney, however, waited for her, and at 10
o'clock he greeted his wif* and nine-year
old daughter. The meeting was an affect
ing one. Ten minutes later Kearney, bis
wife and child and Thomas Haines were
on their way to Kearney's home at 927
Washington averine.
Both men tell remarkable stories and
both vigorously deny that they bad ever
been engaged in any dynamite plot. Th*y
insist that their arrrest was due to a plot
on the part of the English detectives.
Kearney also believes that his own
brother-in-law ws one of the prime
movers in itâ that John Gort, the name
the brother-in-law goes by â is in the pay
of the English Government and actually
laid the wires which brought Kearney to
Rotterdam, knowing that the English
Government wanted him for an alleged
dynamite offense said to have been com
mited in Glasgow many years ago.
Kearney, as well as Haines, seemed
amazed when informed of tbe stories pub
lished concerning him, particularly that
which said that Â£2000 of English money
bad been found in his possession in Rot
terdam when arrested.
"The fact of the matter Is, 1 ' said he,
"that I left New York with less than $150,
and at the time of my arrest I had only
$95 40. I have brought back with me
exactly $1 25. As to the story that I was
engaged in the manufacture of bombs or
destructive affairs I want to say right here
that there is not a word of truth in the
story.
"I started for Europe on Aususti, my
brother-in-law purchasing the passage
tickets with money which I gave him,
ana it was not until I was many days out
that I found my name had been changed
from Kearney to Wittpes. My wife is a
German, and there is a little property com
ing to her over there.
"This brother-in-law suggested that it
would be a good thing to take a trip over
and have the estate settled. As I did not
inten I starting my paper, the Irish Na
tionalist, until September. I readily con
sented to go. I had a pretty good time in
both Antwerp and Rotteriam, living in
the most economical manner until two
days before my arrest.
"While in a saloon one day I met Mr.
Haine?. I recognized him as an Ameri
can, as he did me. I learned from him
that he was in Europe on a vacation. He
asked me if I could tell him a good
hotel to stop at, and I invited him to mine.
When we got to the hotel we found that
there was not a vacant room, so 1 offered
to him, as I would to any other American,
a share of my bed.
"Well, Haines and myself looted about
for the first day, then be became very ill
and I had to nur.se him. He was lying in
bed on the morning of Saptember 13. It
was about 6 o'clock, if I remember rightly,
when there was a knock at the door. I
opened it and found six policemen and an
Englishman, whose name I do not know,
standing on the side. Each carried a
small arsenal and tnen I was told that we
were under arrest.
"The room was never searched in four
presence. Indeed, we were bandied out
side and taken to the statk>nÂ»house. In
our absence they claimed to nave searched
the room and found a number of infernal
machine- under the bed upon which I was
ly inn. Then I was taken to a cell.
"Every day for twelve solid hoars two
policemen sat in tbe cell with me and I was
not allowed to lie down. They kept tell
ing me all the time that I had better save
myself as one of my 'pals' bad confessed.
They spoke to me of Tynan and Bell. I
met Tynan once or twicn in New York,
but never knew him. I did not know Bell
at all.
"Yet they kept harping about confes
sions and informers until I got sick of
listening and refused to talk at all, except
to demand my release, I was never
brought into a police court, but always
before the Police Commissioners, who
kept harping always on the name theme.
They told me that my only hope was to
save myself by confessing. The food I got
was vile. Once I became so exhausted
that I almost lost my mind. I was weak
from lack of food and sleep. I never want
another such experience. I shall never
forget it. Only the Portland Prison con
victs could be treated worse.
"Finally the detectives got tired. They
would not let me see any newspapers,
except those published in foreign lan
guages. I was not allowed to communi
cate with any of my friends.
"Then the time came when we bad to be
released. The Chief of Police tried to
make us sail home by way of England, but
I resolutely refused, for I knew what that
would mean."
JUMPED WHILE DREAMING
Lexcia Vrtailtr Toofc a Fatal Leap From
a Train.
TRENTON. N. J., Oct. 16.â Lewis"
Dressier, a merchant of Jersey City, died
yesterday at St. Francis Hospital of in
juries received by leaping from a train at
Ogder, avenue, a mile beyond the Trenton
depot of the Pennsylvania road. Dressier
was on his way to Pittsburg and hud
fallen aleep, and when the brakemp.n
called Trenton he mistook the call and
rushed to the door and jumped from the
train.
The passengers are of the opinion that
he was asleep at the time and that his
fatal plunge was the result of a night
mare. The train was going at the rate of
forty miles an hour, and he fell on the
tracks and broke the bones of both ioks
and several ribs and was internally in
jured. The trainmen did not know that
he had left the train until they reached
the Trenton station. The station agent at
once sent back a locomotive to find
Dressier, but the search was nnsuccessful,
for he had crawled up the embankment to
the street level, and along the street for
several blocks until a store was reached,
wnere he applied for assistance. He said
he had jumped off the train while dream
ing and was conscious enough, to give
other facts about himself . lie then col
lapsed and was taken to St. Francis Hos
pital, where he continued to sink until he
linalJy died.

HAVANA, Cuba, Oct. 16.â The police
authorities here detained the New York
and Cuba mail steamship Vigilancia,
which was to have mailed hence at 11
o'clock last nijrht for Vera Cruz, on ac
count of the refusal of her masier, Captain
Mclntosh, to deliver to the police an al
leged Spaniard who came from New
York on board of the steamer en route to
Mexico. Consul-General Lee was iniormed
of the facts and he approved of Captain
Mclntosh's refusal to surrender his pas
senger. The affair was finally settled an d
the Vigilancia sailed to-day with the pas
senger on board.
Colonel Augerilia reports that his cav
alry command of 111 men had an engage
ment with 350 rebels, commanded by Def
gado and Pitierre, at Cangre, near Ma
drupa. The rebels were entrenched be
hind stone fences, but they were dislodged
and pursued to the Economica .estate,
where the Spaniards made a furious
charge and completely routed them. Tne
insurgents, according to Colonel Augerilia,
left forty dead on the field, ana despite
the report that they were completely
routed they carried many wounded with
them.
General Molins reports that while on his
way on the gunboat Contramsestre, in
response to a request for assistance by the
Spanish troops on account of the recent
engagement with the rebels at Rio Honda,
near Trinidad, he discovered a number of
groups of insurgents ort shore. He landed
with a party of marines and dispersed the
rebels, capturing 500 rifles, a quantity of
ammunition, a pun-carriage, stores of med
icines, etc., together with two ship's boats
bearing the name "Dauntless."
CONGRESS OF SOCIALISTS.
Women With the Men in Opposing the
Aristocratic Capitalists.
GOTH A. Gkem awt, Oct. 16. âAt to
day's sitting of the Socialist Congress at
Sieblichen, Frau Zeetkin, the women's
rights delegate to the congress deliv
ered a speech in which she declared that
the women of the country were not
against the men, but were heart and soul
with them in opposing the aristocratic
and middle-class capitalists. The work of
first importance, she said, was to organize
the workingwomen, because in Germany
the women were forbidden to join
men's unions, and she proposed the estab
lishment of a propaganda by means of
leaflets and not through papers published
for circulation among women.
Miss Loewenhurz, another of the female
delegates, offered the suggestion that tbe
socialist women join hands with those of
the bourgeois class in their movements,
but the proposition was met with almost
universal opposition on the part of other
female delegates.

VERY GROGGY AT THE FINISH.
But the Referee Does Not See It That
Way and Decides the Contest
a Draw.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 16 -"Spike"
Sullivan of Boston fought a fifteen-round
draw with Danny McÃride of New York
at the Broadway Athletic Club to-night.
It was Sullivan's first appearance as a star
in this city and he put up a game battle.
For the first t*-n rounds "Spike's" style
was oot prepossessing and he was wild and
awkward. McÃride punished him badly,
cutting open his right eye and punching
him Lin! on the face and jaw. At the end
of the eleventh round "Spike" began to
find his way to the body and sent in a
series of terrific swings that weakened his
opponent.
Sullivan rushed at McÃride like a wild
man in tbe thirteenth and landed a series
of swings on body and jaw that quickly
dazed McÃride and the bell saved him.
The local man was better handled than
the Bostonian and came up fairly fresh for
the last round, but Spike quickly took tbe
starch out of him and he was groggy at the
end. Both studied for all they were worth
in the opening of the fifteenth round, but
"Spike" had all the Dest of the rally and
McÃride was all but out. The referee de
clared the bout a draw.
In the preliminary bouts Jack McKeck
defeated Al Allen and Casper Leon fought
a draw with Jimmy Rose, the ex-amateur
bantam champion. In the opinion of the
audience Leon should have had the de
cision.

STANFORD AGAINST OAKLAND.
luirersity J>rrÂ»hmen Will Meet the High
Srhnol football Team.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal.. Oct.
16â The freshmen were somewhat in
clined to default their game with the Oak
land High School, which has been sched
uled to tafce place here, to-morrow, when
it was found that but seven or eight of the
men constituting th- regular team were
able to play, but by skirmishing around
the eleven has been got together, and if it
had an> time for reeuiar team practice it
might make a good showing. The team
will be made up as follows, when play
is called: Center, Buntin; right guard,
Blanchard; left guard, Burnett; right
tackle. Balentine; left tackle, Rusk; right
end. McLaine; left end, Chandler; right
haif, Daly; Jeft half, Diggles; quarterback,
Clemens; fullback, Lanagan.
Thus far the freshman team has proved
weak more because of lack of practice as a
team than because individual men are
lacking in ability. It must be admitted
however, that the 'earn is very light, and
Unless there is more of n tendency to net
the men ah out at regular signal practice,
it is a foregone conclusion that the team s
record will not be a brilliant one.

EUREKA DAMAGE SUITS,
Heirs of a Mad River Bridge
Disaster V.ctim Bring
Action.
Second Case Resulting From tbe
South Jetty Accident Is Also
Commenced.
EUREKA, Cal., Oct. 16.â The first suit
growing out of the wreck on the Arcata
and Mad River railroad resulting from the
collapse of the Mad River bridge on the
evening of September 13 was commenced
here to-day against the railroad company
by Henry C. and John C. Burke and Mary
J. Hopkins, brothers and sister respec
tively of George W. Burke, the engiueer
who lost his life in the wreck. The plain
tiffs are the sole heirs of the deceased.
They demand $25,000 damages, alleging
that the faulty construction *bf the bridge
and the neglect to maintain it in repair
were responsible for the disaster. The de
fendant corporation is composed entirely
of the Korbel brothers and their family of
San Francisco.
A second suit against John C. Bull, as
contractor for the Government work now
being done on Humboldt bar, was also
commenced here to-day. This grows out
ol the accident on the south jetty on the
night of July 17. when Edward Inman
and Angus McDonald were carried over
board with two falling rockcars and
drowned.
A sister of Inman, in the name of his
child, has already commenced suit for
$50,000 damages, alleging faulty construc
t'.o.i of the cars, and now come John and
Catherine McDonald of Prince Edward
Island, who demand a like amount on the
same allegations for the loss of their son,
Angus McDonald. The San Francisco
Improvement Company is heavily in
terested in the contract, but it is said
the company is secured against lo><s in
damage suits by insurance. A third suit,
probably for the same amount, may be
commenced soon by relatives of Kenneth
Ferguson, who was injured in the same
accident* and died two days later from
blood poisoning.

this condition culminated yesterday in a
fight, the ultimate result of which will
probably be that one or the other of the
contestants will be called upon to resign.
It is also claimed that the bone of con
tention was a matter of policy in tbe
administration of certain wards of the
institution. At all events Dr. A. M. Gard
ner and Assiatant Resident Physician G.
R. Bowles had a hand-to-hand conflict, in
which Dr. Gardner received a severe blow
from a manzanita club in the hands of
Bowles and the latter a severe pummel
ing from the fists of Dr. Gardner. The
local attendants were obliged to interfere
and separate the infuriated combatants.
Dr. Gardner's story of the battle is as
follows: "As I stepped into Dr. Bowles'
department, just previous to the trouble,
1 picked up a small feather duster and
began to brush the dust from my shoes.
While doing so Dr. Bowles said :
" 'See here, Gardner, you might as well
understand one thing at this time as well
as at any other time, and that is thru you
can't come into my department and
brush the dirt off of your shoes. If you
want to do that, get out.'
"For a moment I was thunderstruck,
and then I replied:
" 'Why, doctor, I haye always been
accustomed to do this.'
"As soon as I said that, Dr. Bowles
reached under his desk and caught up a
manzanita club, some three feet in length,
and started toward me. Seeing the use
lessness of trying to avoid him, I ran at
him, throwing up my arm to defend my
head. The main for^e of the blow, which
was delivered with all the strength that
the doctor could muster, landed on my
arm, nearly breaking the bone, and I was
also struck acro>s the side of the head,
and aa you can see my eye is greatly dis
colored. I consider that I saved my life
by throwing up my arm. Had the blow
landed fully on my head it would have
killed me.
"I then closed with Bowles and struck
him several blows with my fist, and at
this moment the attendant ran in and
separated us, disarming my opponent. I
really cannot conceive why this attack
was made upon me in this entirely un
called-for manner as our personal rela
tions have always been friendly, although
at times we have differed in policy. 1 can
only account lor tbe attack on the grounds
that by constant contact with insane
patients Dr. Bowles has become mentally
incapacitated."
This morning Dr. Gardner left this city
for Sacramento, where he will lay the
matter before Governor Budd and demand
an investigation.
Dr. Bowles was seen to-night in refer
ence to the encounter between himself
and Dr. GÂ«rdner. He said: "I am sorry
that the affair occurred, but can say posi
tively that nothing was done on my part
that I thought unbecoming a gentieman.
I cannot say less and at present I will not
say more."
BURNED TO DEATH AT LYNDEN.
Fate of a Man Who Was About to Be
Arrested for the Tacoma Ballot-
Box Thefts in June.
TACOMA, Wash., Oct. 16. â Frank
Boyce, who was severely burned in the
bouse of J. F. Miller, near Lynden, What
com County, on Wednesday night, died
to-day just in time to escape arrest on the
charge of stealing the ballots from the
city hall in Tacoma in June last.
Detectives had evidence proving his
guilt, and M. P. Bulger, ex-chairman of
the State Populist Committee and a mem
ber of the City Council, was on the way to
secure his arrest.
The ballots were those cast in the city
election. The theft was discovered during
the progress of the contest case of Orr
against Fawcett, who had been declared
elected. The crime created intense ex
citement at time and a large purse was
offered for the arrest of the perpetrators.
Orr was recently seated by the Supreme
Court. Boyce, it is alleged, left Tacoma,
fearing discovery, and went to the Miller
place, Miller being a relative. During the
absence of Miller and his wife at a Popu
list meeting at Lynden, their house caught
fire, and Boyce was badly burned in a
fruitless attempt to save Miller's three
children, who were burned to death.
PORTLANO STREET MELEE.
Silver Enthusiasts , Attempt to Cheek a
Fraternal Society Parade.
PORTLAND, Or., Oct.. 16.â An incipient
riot occurred on Sixth street to-night,
which for a short time threatened such
serious results that a detachment of police
was called for. The fraternal orders were
parading the streets en route to the Ex
position building.
Grand Marshal Sear attempted to pass a
large crowd of silver people who were hold
ing an open-air mass-meeting. The thor
oughfare was completely blocked and the
silver enthusiasts refused to move. The
marshal's horse was seized and they re
fused to give way. In the short melee
which followed several heads were cracked
and the police arrived just in time to
check a free-for-all fight. Two arrests
were made.

John Casarino, a laborer who disappeared
a week ago from Mmghetti's dairy at
Wildflower, seventeen miles east of this
city, was found floating in a water tank

loss of $300 while on a recent visit to
San Francisco, and it is believed that this
led him to commit suicide. Casarino was
a native of Switzerland and 24' years of
age.

LOS ANGELES JUSTICE.
Sentence Suspended in the Case
of a Sell-Con essed
ThieÂ£
Had Stolen to Provide Food for His
Starving Wife and
Children.
Los angkleB office of the call, \
328 South Broadway, >
Los Angeles, CaL, Oct. 18.)
"My wife was ill and my children starv
ing. I could not stand the sight of their
suffering and took the tools. I sold them
to buy food. Yes, lam guilty. In giving
me sentence I pray that the court will
bear in mind the circumstances which
caused my default."
That was the way Don B. Abbot
pleaded guilty this afternoon to having
taken $2 worth of tools from H. Buhrege,
who lives at 211 Temple street. He told
more. He told bow he had watched his
wife sinking hour by hour for the bare
necessities of life; how his children bad
come to bis knee and asked for bread.
"Only a little bread, papa; that's all we
want." He had heard them say that and
feeling in his pockets found them empty;
money gone, credit gone, position gone.
The usual question was asked:
"Have you anything to say why the
judgment of court should not be pro
nounced upon you?"
"Not hi n ' more than I have said."
"Then I sha 1 sentence yon to i>ay a fine
of $50 and suspend sentence during good
behavior," and Don Abbot with 'a smile
upon his determined face hurried out of
doors, for his wife wa^ ill and when he
left the bread his crime had purchased
wan nearly gone.
SHOT AT A RIVAL.
Murder Attempted by a Wife Who Be~
lieved Herself Wronged.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Oct. 16.â The
wife of William G. Taylor, a newspaper
man of this city, who, it is said, has been
smarting under the attentions accorded
her husband by Miss Beatrice di Luna for
about two years, fired two shots from a re
volver at her rival in a Third-street res
caurant this afternoon. Miss di Luna was
for a time a society reporter under Taylor.
She and the editor were often seen in each
other's company and when they were sub
sequently discharged from one paper the
scandal-mongers wagged their tongues
with much glee.
Mrs. Taylor this afternoon saw Miss di
Luni with her husband. The irate wife
bad a pistol under her cloak. She followed
the pair into Jerry lllich's restaurant, en
tering the place immediately behind
them.
The editor saw trouble brewing and tried
to dissuade his enragea wife from com
mitting any overt act, but all to no pur
pose. She pushed her way past her hus
band and bang! bangl went her pistol at
the cowering form of her rival a lew feet
away. The wife's marksmanship was poor
and no damage resulted except that Miss
di Luna was put into a fit of hysteria. She
fell as if killed by the shot, but soon re
vived.
After the shooting Mrs. Taylor accom
panied her husband to the police station,
where she was locked in a cell in a state
of great mental excitement. Miss di Luna
is a member of an old, highly respected
and formerly wealthy family of this city.

made through malice.
Santa Barbara Burglary.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Oct. 16.â A
burglary possessing some curious features
was committed here last night. The house
of Dr. W. B. Cunnane, on Garden street,
was entered and ransacked, 'the thieves
escaping with $50 in pold and a few dol
lars in silver. Burni matches were scat
tered everywhere and the confusion in
bureau drawers and clothes closets told
that th* thieves had prosecuted their
search for valuables in a very deliberate
way. Mrs. Cunnane's gold watch, which
was among their plunder, was to-day
found hanging by its chain from a tree
near the house on the front lawn.

FiRST COACH

Regular Passenger Service
Begun on the Valley
Railway.
Residents of the San Joaquin
Eager to Patronize the

GROWING FREIGHT BUSINESS.
Long Trains, Laden With Produce
or Merchandise, Arrive
and Depart
FRESNO, Cal., Oct. 16.â The San Fran
cisco and San Joaquin Valley Railway
Company commenced regular passenger
service to-day over its road between this
city and Stockton. A coach is attached to
the freight trains, which have been run
ning regularly for the past three weeks,
for the accommodation of passengers.
The first freight with the coach left
Fresno this morning at 6 o'clock. There
were a number of passengers, but not as
many as there would have been had the
fact that tbe road was commencing gen
eral passenger service been more widely
known. The train which arrived from
Stockton thib evening brought a coach
full of passengers. Many Fresaoans, who
were in Sen Francisco had beard of tbe
coach being put on, and took advantage
of the opportunity for a ride over the new
road.
Every one is eager for the first ride.
The people of Fresno are desirous of
patronizing the competing road and show
ing their appreciation of what Clans
Spreculs and the other San Francisco
capitals s have done for them. It is
doubtful if one coach will be sufficient to
accommodate the immediate travel.
There is also an eagerness among business
men to elve their business to the com
pany. The long trains which leave and
arrive are conclusiv proof of this.
FRESNO TO HOLD A FAIR.
San Joaquin Valley Growers Will Place
Citrus Fruits on Exhibition in
Winter.
FRESNO, Cal., Oct. 16.â At a meeting
of the Chamber of Commerce this evening
it was decided to proceed immediately to
prepare for a district citrus fair, open to
exhibitors from all parts of tne San
Joaquin Valley, to be held in this city
some time during the winter. President
Arthur R. Briggs was empowered to ap
point a committee of six to act in conjunc
tion witn a similar committee from the
Hundred Thousand Club in arranging a
programme for the fair and take such in
itial steps as are necessary. The members
of the chamber were unanimously and en
thusiastically for the fair. Several speeches
were made, and every one asserted him
self as thoroughly in favor of a midwinter
exhibition of citrus fruits, raisins, dried
fruits and other products.
The fair will be general as to exhibits,
but a display of the citrus fruits of the
valley will be made a special feature. The
business men o; the city are thoroughly
in accord with the movement started by
the Chamber of Commerce. It was
proved at the fair held last winter that
Fresno County could make a very credit
able display of citrus fruits. This year it
is the intention to bring in the other
counties of the valley, and with their aid
an elaborate display should be made.
Every packer in the city will display raisins
and dried fruits.
The fair will probably be kept open for
a week, and it is expected that many
visitors will attend from all parts of the
State.
Fresno Hal sins in Demand.
FRESNO, Cal., Oct. 16.â There has
been considerable excitement in the local
raisin market for the past few days.
Prices i.aye been steadily advancing and
3or 4 cents a pound are being offered for
raisins in sweat boxes. Packers are
anxious to buy. They are selling f. o. b.
NEW TO-DAY.
COMMON PLAIN FOOD
It Is Best for Children or Adults.
Natural grains, meat and fruit will make
good blood if the d gestive machinery of
the body is not interfered with.
The blood when first made goes into the
arteries and is of a bright red color. After
it has been used some in supplying the
body it is carried into the vein- and is
there a dark red or purple color. Blood
contains the elements to nourish and build
up tbe body, such as iron, soda, lime, al-
bumen, etc., etc.
When the powers of the stomach and the
bowels are reduced by lack of vitality or
by put tine: coffee and tea into the stomach
the proces es wnich nature goes through
with to change the food into rich, red
blood are seriously interfered with.
if a man could see what a "wet blanket"
he put over his hard-working friend, the
stomach, by putting in coffee, whisky or
tobacco, when it was honestly toliing
away to doits work well, he would never
repeat the outrage and injustice. It is like
striking your friend a visions blow when
he is delving away for you with roigh t and
main. Don't do it. One feels more re-
spect for himself whpn he acts the man
and permits no form of abuse to strangle
and spoil the beautiiul work being done
for him in the human body. No sort of
fun on earth is equal to the fun of being
thoroughly well.
If one wants a pungent piquant, hot
drink for breakfast, lunch or dinner, Ii
can be bad in Postum, the health coffee.
It is made wholly of erains by the Postnm
Cereal Company (Limited) of Battle
Creek, Mich. It can be truly said, "It
makes red blood." It brews the deep seal-
brown color of Mocha; it creams to the
rich -golden brown of Java, and has an
aroma and taste that maKe a man thank-
ful that some one has at last made a com-
bination of the grains that gives such a
delicious hot drink that one can readily
leave off the coffee which" has been hurting
more than one likes to think of.
Medicines are poor crutches. The only
safety is to use food and drink that the
Creator intended for man, and when this
is done the diseases and sick spells gradu-
ally disappear.
Common-sense is quite uncommon ex-
cept with those who give themselves a
shaking now and then, and look plainly
at what they are doing. If a person
knows coffee don't hurt him, let him stick
to it until it does, then such people thor-
oughly appreciate Poslum. Grocers and
druggists testify to larue sales, and the
steady use of those who once try it is evi-
dence of its taking ways.
â¢â¢Just as eood" as Postum Cereal are
words used to defraud the public.

prinonment Without Vamim.
FRESNO, Cal., Oct. 16.â The trial of
tbe suit of Charles Daily against Ander

Bain Threatens trrsno Growers.
FRESNO, Cal., Oct. 16.â The weather
has been threatening to-day, and about 3
o'clock this afternoon a light shower fell.
The skies are overcast to-nighi and there
is fear of a heavy rainfall. The vineyard
ists had ample time to-day to stack their
raisins md prevent any heavy damage.
The drying season has been excellent so
far, but a r ain would delay it considera
bly. T:ie atmosphere in the foothills is
heavily charged with electricity and the
lights of the electric company, which has

city burning very unsteadily to-night.
SAN MATEO CASUALTY.
Young Hunter Killed by the Accidental
Discharge of a Gun in His
Cart.
SAN MATEO, Cal., Oct. 36.â Dave Nel
son, a popular youth, 17 years of age, was
accidentally shot near this city this morn
ing while on the way to the Spring Valley
lakes to hunt ducks, in company with
Linton Keating. Nelson and Keating left
here in a cart to hunt near the Spring
Valley lakes. They had not gone far
when young Nelson dropped tbe reins and
began fo load his gun despite Keating's
protest. Having loaded the weapon he
stood it in the cart, butt end down, and
they continued on their way.
They had gone but a few yards when
they heard the report of a gun, and they
called to a teamster who was passing, ask
ing who was trying to shoot them. The
teamster replied that the gun in their cart
had been discharged. So sudden was the
sbocK that Nelson did not realize that he
had been shot until he saw the blood on
his clothes. Keating took the reins and
immediately drove back to the San Mateo
Hospital, where bis companion was given
all the relief possible, but in vain. The
charge was tound to have entered his left
lung and death came to end his suffering
two hours later.

COLUSA, Cal., Oct. 16.â The Repub
licans had Colusa all to themselves to
night. Bonfires wvre blazing, anvila
booming ami brass bands playing. The
occasion was a political gathering ad
dressed by Judtre Swinnerton of Stockton,
conveyed hither on a special engine to
take the place of Colonel Eddy, who was
to have spoken, but became suddenly ill
tfcis morning.
An audience of about 500 people, induct*
ing the Maxwell McKiniey Club, accom
panied by its band, filled Armory Hall,
when T. C. Barrel!, secretary of the Re
publican County Central Committee, an
nonuced that Hon. J. C. Campbell of

WILL VOTE FOR McKINLEY.
The *â¢ Father of San Diego" Turns His
Back Upon the Camp of Bryan
and Attgefd.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Oct. 16.â A. E. Hor
ton, the "father of San Diego," who
founded the city and was its leading viri
z*n for years, and who still stands in the
front rank, has returned to McKinley af.er
deserting him for a short time durinr this
campaign. Mr. Horton has been a life
long Republican, but he is a free-silver
man, and was therefore persuaded to join
the renegade Republican Silver Club,
which demands that its members shall
vote for Bryan. But Mr. Horton saw the
error of his ways, and he made public a
letter stating frankly just where he stands.
His letter will be a bombsaeliin the silver
camp. He says:
I have tried honestly to support Bryan, be
cause I believe him to be aa honest man and
because I believe most ardently in free silver,
but as the day approaches when I am to cast
ray vote to help determine which party shall
have the power the next four years I find I
cannot give it for the party which has given
us eight years of Grover Cleveland with his
infamous record, with the party that claims that
if Bryan is elected then will jo tip all through
the South "that old, wild, sweet rebel yell."
The issues of the War of the Rebellion are dead,
bat the memories of the people who lived
through those bitter days are still alive, and
it is not best to arouse the old spirit and re
mind us of the principles for which the Demo
cratic party stood then. Neither can 1 give my
vote against the protective tariff.
I have made free silver my rallying cry, as
have the Democrats and Populists. I believe
It is the policy of Americans without regard to
other countries.. We threw off a foreign yoke
once before whea we were a poor straggling
handful of patriots. Now that we are a rich
and powerful Nation it is cowardly to submit
to dictation as to our financial policy.
But I am convinced that we stand on a
broader platform, and one issue alone cannot
determine my vote. I cannot go back: on a life
record of Republicanism for one plank, how
ever important it may be.
Mr. Horton closes his letter by strongly
advocating the return of W. W. Bowers to
Congress from this district.
MISS ANTHONY CONFIDENT.
Believes That California Vste^s Will Sire
the Equal Suffrage Amendment
a Majority.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Oct. 16.â
Among the passengers vrho came in on
last night's steamer from the north was
the grand old woman, Susan B. Anthony,
who had just been campaigning through
San Luis Ooispo and Northern Santa Bar
bara County, and arrived in Santa Bar
bara covered with dust, but as bright end
as full of enthusiasm and determination
as a girl in her teens. Miss Anthony is
the guest of Dr. Ida V. Stambach.
"Splendid work is being done every
where in Northern California," she said
to-day, -and I have stiong dopes that we
shall carry the State, although it is im
possible to predict the results of an elec
tion, for the reason that one's friends are

always in hiding. We can only measure
the s reneth of the opposition on the 3d
of November. You may have observed
that whisky is just beginning to oranie
its forces against us, not openly and
frankly, but by an appeal to voters to take
pains to ascertain the sentiment of candi
dates on the temperance issues. We
know what this means and at what it is
directed."

CARIBOO'S RICH CACHE.
1 Death Overtakes a Miserly Miner After I
He Had Hidden His Fortune in
Banknotes.
VANCOUVER, 8.C.. Oct. 1&â It may
; fail to the lot of some fortunate pros
â  pector in the nreuntain wastes of Cariboo
to come across in his lonely wanderings a
I mine of ready-made money in the form of
banknotes to the value of $25,000. Larry
| Kenny died in tne Old Men's Home at
! Kamloops a few days ago, and tnereby
bangs a tale. Kenny, it is well known, {
was a great hoarder of wealth, and in the \
'â  golden days of Cariboo he was one of the j
few who "s'ruck it rich," and one of the !
still fewer number of those who took care
j of his hardly won wealth.
Larry was in the habit of carrying his j
' money upon him in the form ot bills, but j
| one day having the misfortune to either
| be caught in a drenching rainstorm or to
| pet soused in a creek, his bankbitis had to |
! be submitted to a crying process in the
sun, and wbi!e he was engaged in the
' task of restoring them to their original
condition he was surprised by the sudden
I appearance of a brother miner. With the
inbred fear of the miser, Larry concluded
it would no longer be safe, his secret being
thus discovered, to carry so large an
, amount upon his person, and proceeded
to hide the bills in a place where tue
: chance of discovery would be reduced to a
! minimum. Whether, having found a place
' snitable for the purpose and cached hi*
wealth he was afterward unabie to find
i the spot again, or whether be purposely
I allowed the money to remain in its secret
i hiding-place until with the lapse of time
and failing memory he forgot where it
i wa? hidden, will now never be known, but
somewhere in those mountains of wealth
. the misers treasure still lie* concealed.
I It may be that, finding himself unable as '
; he grew older to make the arduous trip to â 
j his strange bank, the old man could not
I bring himself to impart the secret of h"is
' life to others and so run the risk, so pain
! fui to the miser, of his money enriching !
anybody else.

PHCENIX, Abiz., Oct. 16.â The greatest

the Republicans of Maricopa County.
The city was crowd ea with people from I
the surrounding country, the streets were |
illuminated by bonrires and colored lights j
and the shouts of the enthusiastic mulri- :
tude were deafening. A special train from \
Prescoti brought 150 men, accompanied by !
a brass band, and another train from j
Mera and Tenipe brought 400 more to join
the procession. There were fully 1000
torches in line, and the procession was the
longest that ever threaded the streets of
â¢n Ariz >na town.
Addresses were delivered by A. J. Doran,
candidate for Congress, and Colonel
Thomas Fitch, who had just returned
from the East. They spoke to an im
mense audience in the open air. Both \
speakers are bimetallists, but they heartily ;

SAN JOSE, Cal., Oct. 16.â The little
coneregation of the African Methodist
Church at the corner of Fourth and San

attempted deposine of the pastor, Rev. E.
S. Wiiite, and tha trustees have closed the
church until the retr.rn of Rev. Tillman
Brown of Oakland, the presiding elder of
the district, from the East.
The Rev. llr. White came here from the
East about a year ago. He is a young
man, and fora time his metropolitan airs
made him a general favorite with his
tlock. He paid more attention u> come
members than to others, and this soon led
to a general row in the church. Of the
five trustees only one was in favor of re
taining the pastor, and, as they had no
authority to discharge Mr. White, they
decided to dose the church until the pre
siding elder's return.
This decision was reached nearly a
month ago, but the Rev. White refused to
be ousted. He showed up with clock-like
regularity every Sunday, and after re
maining his allotted time on the church
steps went home. About a week aeo he
presented to the trustees a bill for $ISO for
salary. They refused to honor it and Eev.
Mr. White attached the church for his
salary, and ' Constable Haley now has
charge of the edifice.

of dynamite which had been buried a few
I inches underground by some one and for
j gotten. The line of defense -passed under
â¢ a live-oak tree, under which lay an empty
j box and a bucksaw. i As there is no bouse
I in the vicinity this was remarked upon by
! the men as strange. â¢
Suddenly Banbury heard a noise, as of a
dynamite fuse burning, near the box. and
shouted for the men to run. Ail did so,
i but as no explosion followed five of them,
I including the leader, returned to the tree
and Ban bury began shoveling the fire and
cinders away from the place where the
fuse was supposed to be. Ju-t then an ex
plosion occurred, throwing Banbury back
, ward and stunning him. Boyd, who was
i near, was also injured. Both men were
I cut and bruised by/the shower of rocks
1 caused by the explosion; and were burned
about the head and hands. They were
brought to Pasadena this morning and
their injuries attended to.

SHARK AGAINST WHALE.
I Terrific Battle Between Ocean Monsters
Witnessed by Passengers on a
Steamsh p.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Oct. 16.âPassen
gers on the steamer Comox, which re
turned from its usual trip among the
i islands of the Gulf of Georgia last week,
| report haying witnessed a terrific battle in
j northern waters between a whale and a
; f ox shark or thresher. While the vessel
i was proceeding on the homeward journey
three whales were sighted some distance
away, and while the passengers were
watching the gambols of the leviathans a
sudden disturbance in the water attracted
their attention. It was then that a
[ thresher had made its appearance within
j a few yards of the whales and was offering
battle to the smaller of the trio. Glasses
! were called into requisition, and with
their aid the progress of the battle was fol
' lowed with absorbing interest.
The thresher, pursuing bis usual plan
I of campaign, made every effort to Uoiate
, his victim from its companions, which
i took no part in the battle. Having by re
peated attacks in the water driven the
small whale some distance away from
them, the assailant was seen to repeatedly
jump clear out of the water, descending
each time with terrific force upon its vic
tim, inflicting on each descent a cruel
gash in the while's body with the sword
like weapon -which the upper lobe of the
tail forms. So actiye ia his movemen s
| was the shark that its victim seemed po.w
-j erless to evade the repeated onslaughts,
â¢ and the blood, which dyed the water
crimson for a considerable distance, bore
evidence of the fact that it was rapidly
I losing strength. After the battle bad con
i tinued for about an hour the gathering
[ darkness prevented close observation of
the strun-le, but the joam into which the
i water was churned as the brutes continued
i their deadly com.ba; was noticeabe tor
some time. Finally the body of the
i dying whale was seen floating on the
water as ihe ooat proceeded on its
course.
All who witnessed the conflict describe
it as one of the most excitin* sights they
have ever seen, the frantic effort* of the
wfaaie to shake off it* enemy, the wonder
ful activity of the thre^aer. the wild
churning of the waters into foam, all af
fording a spectacle none were likely to
forget.

The . Most Remarkable Marine
Exploit on Record.
Farther Details of the Trip cf Harbo
and Samu lscn, Who Rcwed Across
the Atlantic in an Open Boat.
â¢ For the first time in history men have
succeeded in crossing the Atlantic under
impulse of oars alone. Many craft of
small tbn'haae have sailed across, bat row-
ing is quite a different matter.
On Saturday, June 6, George Harbo and
Frank Samuelson, young Norwegian fish-
ermen, residents of 5 Atlantic j Highlands,
N. J.. started on a long journey to Havre,
France, from the Battery, in New York.
Their boat, the ' fox, about 17 feet long,
was built under Harbo's supervision es-
pecially for this risky trip. It was ar-
ranged and equipped to meet every con-
tingency which could be foreseen.
THE FOX IS CAPSIZED.
i The little craft was provisioned for the
entire trip (estimated at sixty days), and
carried no sail whatever. The men wore
safety belts around their waists to attach
them firmly to the; boat, to be especially
used, of course, in rough westher. The
boat had no shelter other than a canvas to
sleep under. A more perfectly frank way
of challenging the sea to do its worst can-
not be imagined. ' According to the law of
chances they shonid have gone to the
bottom. ; ;
â¢ Nevertheless, they arrived at the Scilly
Islands August 1 and at Havre three days
later. That they. were prepared for emer-
gencies is shown by the following cable-
gram: â  'â â â â  'â -:'.- â  â ;-. -- -
- "SCILLY ISLANDS, Aug. 1, 1896.
"To the Brunswick Fnarmacal Company,
~ ; 92 William street, New York:
"Arrived. Boat upset in storm July 10.
Yino-Kolafra greatest help. Perhaps
saved us.. 1 HARBO."
â¢The fact that Harbo was provided with
the African sustaining tonic was due to a
suggestion made by Mr. J. H. Mayo, re-
siding at Atlantic Highlands, - where he
personally knew , Harbo and became
lamihar with his scheme.
. Mr. Mayo took a great interest in Harbo's
enterprise, and having read of the sustain-
ing powers of Viuo-Kolafra when unusual
exertion and endurance 'â  are called for,
suggested that Harbo take a supply as
part of the stores of his craft. The idea
striking him favorably, Harbo obtained a
quantity from the Brunswick Pharmacal
Company, agreeing on his arrival to cable
the results of its use. .* "
Harbo's reference to the value* of Vino-
j Kolafra in his dispatch, and in fuller ac-
counts since received, recalls the fact that
the Yale track athletes used it with marked
success in their contests with the { Cam-
bridge athletes last season. And it is a
fair, inference that Bob" Cook's 'omission
to employ it in the Henley races, contrary
to the example of the Leander crew, had
something to do with the latter's victory
over the Yale boys. .. vv â *
Before leaving New York Harho stated
to friends that what be feared most was
that in very high, combing seas the boat
might be, upset either by roiling over
beamwise or by being | tossed end over end
by- â¢an unusually . high and â¢', precipitous
wave. Against the results of such an ac-
cident he had provided by life lines, al-
ready referred to, which prevented the
men being washed a way from the boat-
Si ach an overset actually occurred on July
10, as reported by the , Norwegian bark
| Cito, Captain ; Clausen, which arrived at
: Pembroke, England, on July 24 from
Quebec, nav.ng spoken the Fox on the
15th in latitude 47 degrees north and longi-
tude 31 degrees ; west. They succeeded,
after a terrible straggle, in righting the
boat and proceeding on their way. The
power of Vino-Kolafra in stimulating and
heartening the men after such a fight for
life (as well as during the whole passage)
they heartily acknowledge. It cave them
the strength, courage and fortitude needed
in an adventure which * called for the
highest qualities of manhood.' . , - r

SHORTENED SAIL
The French Warship Du
guay Trouin Has
Arrived.
She Used Both Sail and Steam
While Gaining an En
trance.
HADE A PRETTY PICTURE.
Trouble Is Brewing in South Amer
ica and Several Vessels Are
Ordered There.
The French warship Duguay Trouin
will not remain in port after to-day. She
was to have gone to Mare 'lsland for a
thorough overhauling, but the Venezue
lan question seems to be no nearer a set
tlement than ever, and warships are in
demand in South America. The Trouin
was to have remained here a month, and
after docking at the Mare Island yard a
thorough overhauling was to have been
given her. Now, however, all this has
been changed, and the vessel will sail for
Guayaquil this afternoon. None of the
men have been given shore liberty, and
tne sailors are angry in consequence.
Every man aboard is on waiting orders,
and tbe chances are that the gunboat may
trip her anchor and sail at a moment's
notice.
The Duguay Trouin made a very pretty
picture as she entered port a few days ago.
The engines were under a slow bell, and
Captain Bavle was making all the use
possible of his sails. The departure of
the Trouin without allowing the men
shore liberty will spread consternation
among the French colony.
The United States cruiser Philadelphia
got into port yesterday. Her destination
is also uncertain. She came here from
Puget Sound, but whether she will go to
The French Warship Duguay Trouin as She Appeared Making Port a Few Days Ago. Captain Bayle Brought
All the Sails Possible Into Requisition.
Mare Island or South America remains to
be seen. In tbe mean time she swings to
an anchor in Mission Bay, and keeps the
Duguay Trouin company. "Is tnere any
trouble down Eouth?" is the general ques
tion asked along the from just now.
The Kilbrannon may not come to San
Francisco after all. The purchase price
has not been paid, and the Fearless may
come back to this port light, The big tug
sailed yesterday with the lighter in tow,
and on her arrival at Port Townsend
Captain Randall will make all the neces
sary arrangements. If the owners of the
Kilbrannon do not want a tow, then tbe
tug will come back light. If they do then
the ship will be towed to San Francisco
for repairs.
The steamer Umatilla was floated yes
terday, and the chances are tbat she will
be in San Francisco inside of a month.
Captain C. Miner Goodall has been a
thorough success as a "wrecker," and the
company is more than pleased.
The British tramp Flintshire got in
from Yokohama yesterday. She was in
ballast, but took twenty-six days to make
tbe run. She will load wheat for Europe.
The steam schooner National City put
in here yesterday in order to unload some
machinery from Eureka. Some repairs
have to be made to C. A. Hooper's mills
at Eureka, and in consequence the
machinery had to come to San Francisco.
To accommodate the mili-owners the
steamer took the stuff and put in here to
deliver it. ___________
PONIARD IN EACH POUND,
Dr. Vcorsanger Declares That
Death Lurks in Bad
Food.
Scientific Sanitation of Greater Local
Value Than tbe Maintenance
of Forts
Dr. Voorsanger delivered a Friday
evening lecture at tne Temple Emanu-Ei
last night, taking for his subject "The
Health of the City and the Duty of the
Citizens Toward It."
Dr. Voorsanger said that the subject
was suggested by an agitation last sum
mer. The Board of Health asked the
.Board of Supervisors to increase its ap-
Jpropriation, making a figure which was
â  then considered preposterous. Good
Vvork was done, and the appropriation
>as brought up to $57,000 for the present
year, and this enabled the Board of
Health to organize the sanitary work on a
scientific basis. For this the Supervisors
deserve thanks.
The health of the community was of
first importance. More than gold or sil
ver or tbe choice of an executive of the
Nation was the question of the life or
death of the community. To live as long
as possible is a duty. He who neglects to
do this commits suicide. There was a
hygienic law of self-defense. Nations
erect fortifications and teach children
self-defense. Only recently bad it been
realized that there was as much need to
teach the mind as to steel the arm;
there was as much necessity for guarding
the lives against noxious gases as for
providing fortifications and heavy guns
for defense against hostile nations.
People did not take care of themselves
nor of the public health. The individual
should care for his health because the in
dividual is the cornerstone of the public
health. More people die from a careless
treatment of natural diseases than from
the vicissitudes of the battlefield. In a
hundred fashions people commit suicide;
by gorging, by alcoholic stimulants, by
highway robbery of rest, turning night
into day, by poison, by the inhalation of
poison. The law of God bade men to live
long in the land. Tbe vanity of men
taught them to let to-morrow take care of
itself.
The first duty of a well ordered com
munity was to provide the means by
which the lives of the public can be pro
longed. In Queen Elizabeth's time the
mortality in London was 40 and a fraction
in the 1000. Now the death rate in Lon
don was only 19 to the 1000. That makes
London the "healthiest city in the world.
That was strange, for in London and the
suburbs are at least 5,000,000 people. The
city is so crowded that tne authorities
have to allot the cubic space. There are
thousands who are homeless, without
medical attendance, driven to excesses.
Chicago and New YorK were the health
iest cities in the United States, in spite of
so much vice, hunger and poverty. The
explanation was sanitation and the lib
eral expenditure of money to preserve the
people's health.
Since 1878 there have not been more
than a few sporadic cases of yellow fever
in Southern cities. Formerly there was
an annual epidemic. Sanitation was the
explanation, with cleanliness, flooding
of streets and medical skill. A careless
community makes a careless government.
If the people of San Francisco were not so
indifferent concerning the important mat
ter of the health of the children no Board
of Supervisors would ever permit any
board of competent physicians to come
before them as beggars.
The competent inspection of milk in
New York had reduced tbe mortality of
children in that city Dy at least 18 per
cent. The food of the people of San Fran
cisco needed to be inspected. Pounds of
fish, meat and vegetables were being
smuggled into San Francisco, and in every
pound was a poniard to stab some poor
sufferer to death because of its taint. No
armed fleet, shooting the City to pieces,
could effect sucn ruin as may enter
through the Golden Gate in the shape of
a plague.
Competent quarantine regulations were
necessary. No body of men or immigrants
bad the ri?ht, by their own unsanitary
condition, to threaten the public health.
The filth of Chinatown deserved attention.
Professor Macewen had said at Cooper
College that San Francisco had a great
dangerâ not the Chinaman, but China
town â and that in his travels all over the
world he had never viewed elsewhere such
unsanitary conditions as existed in China
town.
Every man had a duty in connection
with sanitation. Every man should up
hold a competent Board of Health, that
tbe standard of sanitation of San Francisco
might be as high as that of any other
community, and that the people might
live long in the land that the Lord their
God hath given them.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 17, 1896.
MAY YET OBTAIN
AN OBSERVATORY
New Trial Ordered Con
cerning the Spence
Trust.
A Partial Victory Scored for the
University of Southern
California.
STORY OF A TELESCOPE.
It Was to Be the Largest on Bartfc,
but tbe Lenses Were Sold
to Chicago.
In a decision banded down in the Su
preme Court yesterday the judgment of
the Superior Court in the case of Anna M.
fepence, executrix of the last will of E. F.
Spence, against the trustees of a trust for
the benefit of the University of Southern
California, was set aside ard the case was
remanded for a new trial. This has more
than a passing interest.
E. F. Spence, during his life, conveyed
to M. M. Bovard, H. Sinsabaugh, J. P.
Wianey, P. M. Green, R. M. Widney and
himself, as trustees of an express trust,
certain lots of land in Los Angeles Co anty.
His purpose was to provide means for the
purchase and establishment of a great
astronomical observatory, which should
be an adjunct of great value to tbe Uni
versity of Southern California. This was
to be known as the Spence Observatory.
The scheme was a laree one. A feature of
it was the ambition which Mr. Spence en
tertained to have the observatory equipped
with the largest telescope in existence,
in fact that it should have a Jorty-inch
lens. The observatory was to be abso
lutely the property of the University of
Southern California, to be managed by the
trustees of that institution. The trust
was accepted. The conveyance bore date
of January 22, 1889. When the news was
first made public that Mr. Spence had
provided for the biggest telescope in the
world for Southern California the an-
nouncement caused a great stir in scien
tific and educational circles.
One of the nrst acts of the six trustees
was to authorize Alvan Clark & Sons of
Boston to contract with M. Mantois of
Paris for the purchase of a forty-inch
telescope at the cost of 80,000 francs. The
agreement was that the trustees would
pay 20,000 franos when the first lens was
delivered, 20,000 francs upon the delivery
of the second lens, and the balance of the
contract price, 40,000 francs, one year after
the second payment should have been
made. When the fir-t lens was done tbe
trustees borrowed $5500 with which to
maice the first payment.
That was the only payment for which
the trustees made provision. The money
for tbe first lens was borrowed from the
State Loan and Trust Company of Los
Angeles, to which the trustees gave their
note and also a mortgage on the land
donated by Spence. The first 20,000 francs
went to Paris and M. Mantois worked on
the second lens and in time delivered it to
Alvan Clark & Sonsl But when the second
lens arrived there was no money on hand
to be used in paying for it.
The trustees had a great deal 0! serious
talk about the situation. J. P. Widney
was the president of the University of
Southern California at that time. He
conferred with Mr. Snence, and the two
agreed that the best thing that could be
done under the circumstance was to sell
the two lenses and to begin all over. Mr.
Spence died soon after this, on September
19, 1892. The two lenses were sold to the
University of Chicago and a part of the
money was devoted to taking up the
mortgage on the Spence lots. The evi
dence .which has been taken during the
litigation developed that the lenses were
sold at a profit over the original cost price.
While Messrs. Bovard and Spence lived
ijuvard managea tne business 01 tue tru&t.
When Spence died the surviving trustees
continued in possession of and cared for
the trust property. September 7, 1893,
Mrs. Anna M. Spence began an action
and the Superior Court canceled and set
aside the conveyance of the property from
Spence to the trustees, and also denied a
new trial. Then the case came on appeal
to the Supreme Court, from which a de
cision issued yesterday.
The Supreme Court found that the trus
tees intended to go ahead with the per
formance of the terms of the trust, and
that the University of Southern California
has never consented to the abandonment
of the trust. Justice McFarland dissented.
He saw no reason to dispute the judgment
of the lower court. The conditions can
never be fulfilled, for the trust provided
that Spence should approve of the choice
of the site for the observatory, but Spence
was dead. Again the trust provided that
four trustees should concur in the per
formance of certain essential matters, but
this was impossible, as three of the six
were dead, the number including Bovard,
to whom special powers were entrusted.
No conservatory, such as was contem
plated in the trust, could be erected, and
no selection of site could be made in the
manner specified.
NO MORE A REFUGE.
The Old French Hospital Rented to
Lumber- Dealers.
The old French Hospital on Bryant
street, between Fifth and Sixth, will no
more be tbe refuge of the afflicted. It has
been rented for $200 a month to Harris &
Jones, dealers in lumber. The company
will use the grounds to relieve its over
crowded yards, and it is understood will
fit the building up with machinery for
manufacturing dressed lumber.
The building was erected in 1852, and
was used continuously up to eighteen
months ago by the French Mutual Bene
fit Society as a hospital. Then it was oc
cupied by the Salvation Army at a rental
which was little more than nominal.
The present arrangement is considered
one of advantage to the society, although
the rent is not high for the extensive
premises. It is understood that the ar
rangement now entered into with Harris
& Jones will result eventually in a sale.
The society values the property at $60,000.
Day's i-ecord of the Morgue.
J. C. Moore, a clerk, aged 40, committed sui
cide yesterday morning by asphyxiating him
self with gas In the closet of his room at 20
Ninth street. The suicide bored a hole in the
closet and then attached a rubber hose to the
gasjet and thence to the hole In the door. The
deceased was found crouched on the floor in a
corner of the closet. Moore has been out of
work for some time and committed the rash
act as the result of despondency. Three other
cases, all natural causes, were reported at the
Morgue yesterday, as follows: John Titns,
plumber, 230^ Third street; Frank Holland
ot Fresno, found dead on section 1 of the sea
wall; H. Hendrickson, died at the California
street Police Station. Holland was an expert
pool player and was known In sporting circles
as "Mulnolland."
TO TRY FOR FREEDOM.
Habeas Corpus Proceedings in
Behalf of Louis Green
wa d.
His Attorney Claims That His Term
of Imprisonment Is More
Than Up.
Application has been filed with Judge
Ross of the United Statea Circuit Court
for leave to file a petition for a hearing,
under writ; of habeas corpus, of the case of
Louis Greenwald, now serving a si years'
term in San Quentin for smuggling
opium. The application has been filed by
Crandall & Buli, who have been engaged
for the purpose. It will be heard in open
court on Monday, the United States At
torney having been notified. This io a re
vival of the famous Emerald smugghnz
case.
Greenwald, together with George Wick
ham and George Thomas, were sentenced
on the 15th of June, 1894, under a convic
tion of a "conspiracy to smuggle opium,"
to undergo an imprisonment of two years
on each of three counts and to pay a tine
of $2000 on each of the same, the second
term not to begin until the expiration of
the first term and the payment of the fine.
The attorneys will plead for the imme
diate release of Greenwald on the ground
that there is no authority in Jaw for such
a sentence, the effect of which would be.
if the prisoner were unable to pay the fine
or were too poor to employ a lawyer, to
keep him confined for life. "In the first
place," said Mr. Bull, speaking of the
matter yesterday, "there is no such crime
known to the law as 'conspiracy to smug
gle opium.' The crime witn which these
people should have been charged in the
indictment is 'conspiracy to defraud the
United States Government.' The maxi
mum punishment upon conviction of such
crime is two years and a fino of $10,000.
"But there is no provision that the im
prisonment shall continue until such fine
is paid. Here Greenwald and the others
were sentenced to six years and fines, the
fines to be collected at intervals of two
years and the imprisonment to continue
until the money be paid. The fact is," he
continued, "Greenwald's ierm is more
than up. With credits for good behavior
and the limit of imprisonment being two
years for his offense, he should have been
released in February last. The matter
will be fully heard in court on Monday."

TO MARCH FOR
REPUBLICANISM
The National League Pre
paring for a Monster
Demonstration.
Committees Appointed to Work
Out the Details Quickly
and WelL
LOCAL POLITICS BABBED.
The Transparencies to Be Restricted
to tbe Advocacy of McKinley
and Hobart
The parade committee of the National
Republican League is not idling away its
time. It is very busy and the results of
its labor promise to appear on Saturday
evening, tbe 31st of this month, in the
largest and most Inspiring political dem
onstration ever seen on this coast.
Colonel George A. Stone, grand mar
shal, promises 15,000 men in line and 20,
-000 visitors to the City to witness it.
Every member of the committee is en
thusiastic and fully alive to the import
ance of not only making the procession
long but representative of the big issues in
politics this year, representative of Re
publicanism, dignified, intelligent, in
structive and honest.
A meeting of the parade committee was
held last evening at the National League
headquarters, Colonel Frank W. Sumner,
chairman of the committe, presiding.
The fact of the parade was first deter
mined upon, and all organizations in
sympathy were invited to participate.
That being done the men who must
gather the funds aud look out for the
thousand and one details were to be
chosen. It was determined to split up the
committee into smaller committees on
finance, on music, transportation, etc.,
and it was done by Colonel Sumner, as
follows:
Finance â I. J. Truman, Frank Johnson,
William Cluff, John F. Sheehan, Andy Branch,
T. B. Morton, Frank I). Worth.
jL'uaicâ Hugo Keil, B. W. Spear, V. T. North
rup.
Fireworksâ Oscar Lewia, George H. Fair
child, James Kipp.
On suggestion of Colonel Stone, the
chairman of the general committee,
Colonel Sumner was added to the com
mittee on finance.
The question of transparencies and the
legends they should bear was calied up by
Thomas Bannerman. His suggestion for
excluding objectionable signs was ap
proved and the matter turned over to the
grand marshal, who will call for reports
from all clubs as to numbers, equipment
and tbe banners to be carried.
It was suggested tbat a committee could
do good work by originating terse legends
for inocription upon banners which could
be made to tell the whole story of the
campaign, or rather to explain the Repub
lican view of the issues involved. The
committee named by Colonel Stone for
this purpose included, besides himself,
Thomas R. Bannerman and Frank W.
Sumner.
It was determined that no transparen
cies be permitted in the line in the interest
of any candidates but McKinley and Ho
bart and the Republican nominees for
Congress. This was formally decided npon
by resolution.
As to the industrial features of the pa
rade Colonel Stone said all tbe different
industries hoping to be benefited by the
success of Republican principles and the
election of McKinley would oe invited to
join in the demonstration and make a big
and interesting showing.
The committee will meet again Tuesday
evening, and the finance committee will
meet this morning.
While this was going on the Ladies'
Annex was holding a busy meeting,
directed along tbe same lines, in an ad
joining room, Mrs. Georgie Spencer pre
siding. Mrs. N. J. Vidaver was elected
permanent secretary of the annex, and
Mrs. J- E. Harvey, treasurer.
The following committee was appointed
on parade: Mrs. H. Noble, Mrs. Nellie
Holbrook-Blinn, Mrs. iiester Harland,
Miss Maud Jamison, Mrs. Vidaver.
Add. asses were made by Mrs. J. Murray
Bailey, by Mrs. Ballou and Mrs. Hester
Harland.
An entertainment and dance will be
given by the ladies of the annex for the
benefit of the parade fund in Pioneer
building on the evening of the 26. h.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL,
Patriotism, Protection

FOR PRESIDENT-
WILLIAM McKINLEY, of Ohio
FOB TICK-PRESIDENTâ
GARRET A. HOBART, of New Jersey
Election November 3, J896.
Tnings have begun to boom.
The people know McKinley is coming.
Business brightens as Bryanism fades.
Restore the protective system ana busi
ness will be all right.
If you vote for the welfare of your own
industry you will vote right.
Election day will be labor's opportunity
to redeem itself from the free-trade blight.
Modifying pledges is a very common
Democratic trick. Don't trust any of the
gang. f
We cannot develop the resources of
California unless we protect the industries
of the people.
Foreign goods are always dear goods
when their importation leaves American
labor unemployed.
The business sense of the country is
against Bryan and after all that is the
Bense of the people.
Bryan appeals to classes while McKin
iey speaks for the whole people. Can the
classes outvote the people?
This is the day to leave orders for Thk
Etjhd&Y Call if you wish good reading lor
to-morrow. Don't forget it.
Keep your eye on the fight for the sena
torship. Tho Senate will hold the key of
legislation for the next four years.
We may now expect to hear some Popo
crat orator challenge Tom Reed to a de
bate. Impudence is equal to almost any
thing.
The Popocrats are hardly to be blamed
for abandoning argument and taking to
vituperation. It is certainly time for
them to swear.
The be9t instruction given in the cam
paign of education has been based on the
lessons taught by experience during the
last three years.
There is still a chance for David Bennett
Hill to talk, but what he is looking for is
a chance of re-election to the Senate and
he cannot find it.
Tom Watson's throat is said to be so
ulcerated he can't talk. The poor fellow
Beems to have got it in the neck even
worse thai was supposed.
Wear a McKinley button and declare
3'ourself vigorously for sound money and
protection. That is the way to help bring
about a return to prosperity.
It is the home market that sustains the
producer and the workingman and who
ever votes against protection votes against
thÂ« rery means by which he lives.
The way in which Bryan misrepresents
those from whom he quotes is a fair illus
tration of the way in which he would
misrepresent those from whom he solicits
votes.
The Democrats who have modified their
rledges to the Non- Partisans will modify
their pledges to the people if they are
elected. The oniy safe course is to vote
for Republicans and straight politics.
The retirement of Tillman from the
campaign is a sure sign that while his
pitchfork may have been useful enough in
turning over the muck of a South Carolina
barnyard it has not been found agreeable
to the workers in the open field of politics.
The Bryanites will try by every means
in their power to defeat the election of
Republicans to Congress and a Republi
can United States Senator. To accom
plish these results they have made trades
and dickers of all kinds. It depends on
the people to turn fusion into confusion
and guard the industries of California
against the free-traders
Bince the Democrats have cited Bis
marck as a guide in this campaign it may
be just as well to remind them that in the
prime of bis intellect be said: "It is my
deliberate judgment that the prosperity of
America is mainly due to its system of
protective laws." On this ground Bis
marck urged Germany to adopt the pro
tective system. It will be noted that he
bas not urged Germany to try free silver
independent of other commercial nations.
Those Democratic candidates for the
Legislature who after having made pledges
to the Non- Partisans to get their nomina
tions have now seen fit to modify their
pledges in order to get the support of the
Democratic bosses are very good people
for the voters to leave at home on election
day. They need some time to meditate on
their conduct and see what fools they
have made of themselves in trying to be
too smart.
HOW BUSINESS MEN WILL VOTE.
As the campaign has proceeded it has
become a matter of increa-ung certainty
to the minds of impartial observers that
the business men and business interests of
California are with the Republican Na
tional ticket. The phrase "businessmen
and business interests" does not embrace
alone bankers and manufacturers or
members of large corporations. It in
cludes also the merchants and the trades
men of the cities and towns of the State.
A canvass of every section shows that a
very large proportion of those who com
pose this class of voters will cast their bal
lots for the Republican electors on the
3d day of November.
The reason for this is plain. No
body of men understand better the needs
of business and the conditions under
which alone it can thrive than do the
merchants, tho tradesmen and the shop
keepers of a community. Ihese men are
the intermediaries between the producer
and the consumer. They buy of the
former and sell to the latter all kinds of
goods. The certainty of profit and the
exact calculation of its amount is essen
tial to their continuance in trade. They
buy and sell goods upon credit to a con
siderable extent, and as a rule the term of
the credit upon which they sell exceeds
that upon which they buy. This is true
particularly as applied to the retail mer
chants of the interior towns, who must
carry their customers from season to
season and from the time the crops are
planted until they are harvested and
sold.
These being the conditions under which
merchants must conduct their business, it
is clear that the money of the country,
which is the medium of their trade, must
have stability of value, in order that they
may correctly estimate their prices and
profits. They must know, for example,
when they buy goods upon credit, that the
value of those goods will not materially
rise or fall by reason of a difference in the
purchasing power of the money which
they have agreed to pay. On the other
hand, when they sell the same goods,
they must be equally assured that the
money which they will receive for
the articles at the end of the term of
credit which they have extended, will
have the same value which it possessed
wnen they bought Che goods. Whenever,
therefore, in a political campaign, the is
sue is presented to them as to which
party promises to maintain stability in
our country's currency, its merchants will
be found arrayed beneath the banner of
the party which gives to them that
pledge.
There can be no question as to which
party in the present contest is assuring
stability of value in our country's cur
rency. It is the Republican party which
gives that assurance. It is the Democratic
and Populist parties wnich expressly re
fused to do so, and unite in the declaration
that they propose to destroy it. It is for
this reason that the merchants and trades
men of California are outspoken in their
allegiance to the Republican party, and
from the wholesale dealer in the largest
cities to the retail storekeeper in its small
est village comes the assurance that this
year all are for McKinley. From such assur
ance springs the cheerful and well
founded prediction that California will go
Republican by one of the largest major
ities cast for a candidate and a party dur
ine its history as a State.
I am one of those who believe that it
Is the business of this country to make
laws for the benefit of thU country. I
believe the business of this free Gov
ernment is to preserve the American
market to the American producer,
whether in the factory or the farm,
and to preserve the American mines
and the factories of the American
workmen. "We want enough tariff In
this country put upon foreign goods
that compete with ours to make up the
difference between the wages paid to
labor in Europe and the wages paid to
labor in the United States.â McKinley.
ERYAN THE GARBLER.
One of the worst characteristics of Mr.
Bryan's nature is exposed by his persist
ent misrepresentation of the sentiments of
his opponents. He has carried the prac
tice of garbling the speeches of noted men
to an extent which no one would ever
have believed a candidate for the Presi
dency could be guilty of. There has been
no limit to these misstatements, and not
infrequently they have gone to tne verge
of what seems to be intentional falsehood.
Scarcely any man of note in the country
has escaped Mr. Bryan's misrepresenta
tion. Every speech made in favor of bi
metallism in former years has been dis
torted by him to imply a support of silver
monometallism, while speeches of a self
same tenor by the same men this year
have been distorted to mean gold mono
metallism. Democrats like Mr. Carlisle,
and Republicans ia great number have
been in this way accused of inconsistency
and held up to the public as vioiators of
their pledges and false to their convictions
of right.
We have frequently called attention to
these misstatements and have done all
that can be done to head off what, for
fault of a better term, may be justifiably
called "campaign lies." as fast, however,
as one misstatement is refuted another
appears. The latest victim of this system
of misrepresentation i 3 Colonel Robert
lngersoll, who, because he spoke for the
remonetization of silver in the past and is
now opposing the election of Mr. Bryan,
has been charged by that boy orator with
inconsistency and a violation of his
record.
Mr. lngersoll himself has not been slow
to answer the statements of Mr. Bryan.
He calls attention to the fact that
the charge of inconsistency is sus
tained only by quoting portions
of his former speech, and not the
whole of it. Like every other Repub
lican, he favored bimetallism and the
largest possible use of silver as money. He
never at any time advocated a silver
dollar that could not be maintained at a
parity with gold. In a speech at Chicago
be quoted from the speech of former years,
to which Mr. Bryan has alluded, and
showed that his position then is clearly
consistent with his position now. He has
been inconsistent no more than the whole
Republican party has been inconsistent.
The crand old party never favored silver
monometallism and does not favor gold
monometallism. It stands pledged to re
store the free coinage of silver by inter
national agreement, and on that pledge
has the support of the majority of the
American people.
The question of personal inconsistency
is not one of great public importance. A
man who increases in learning from year
to year, who grows in wisdom by ex
perience, or who has sense enough to
change his views with the change of cir-
cumstances must of necessity appear at
times inconsistent in his course. No wise
man condemns one who adopts a policy
suited to the day, instead of sticking to a
policy which was suited to yesterday.
What, however, shall we say of a candi
date for the Presidency who, in an effort
to fasten the silly charge of inconsistency
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 17, 1896.
against his opponent, resorts to the com
mon trick of garbling speeches and the
lowest form of misrepresentation?
The Republican party does not con
ceal its purposes ; they are an open
book. Everything that the Kepnbli
cun party believed in when it ha* been
in power it has written in public law.
It has no aim but the public good; it
hag ever stood on the side of the coun
try and the flag. Its great central idea
has been the welfare of the people and
all the people, and every principle that
it hag ever advocated has embraced
the highest good for the greatest num
ber of American citizens. â McKinley.
THE WAY TO PROSPERITY.
The address of Major McKinley on
Thursday to the workingmen of Canton
contains a complete statement of the
whole issue before the people of the
United States in this campaign, so far as
that issue is confined to economic ques
tions. The address should be read by
every workingman, for it concerns the in
terests and the welfare of them all.
Mr. McKinley reviewed the campaign
of 1892, and called attention to tne con
trast between the statements of Kepub
lican and of Democratic orators at that
time. The Democrats declared that if the
McKinley tariff were overthrown and
steps taken in the direction of free trade,
tne prosperity of the country would be
largely increased, while the Republican
speakers, and particularly McKiniey him
self, warned the people that any weaken
ing of the protective system would resuit
in a decrease in American wages and the
loss of employment by thousands of
American workingmen.
In answer to the Democratic argument
that if we had free trade we can buy things
more cheaply than under the protective
system, Mr. McKiuley said that this claim
was true enough, but that it told only half
the story. Free trade would enable the
foreigner to overthrow American competi
tion, and he would then be able to fix the
price to suit himself. A few years of free
trade would be sure to result in high prices
paid for foreign goods instead of low prices
for home products. We have seen half of
this prophecy fulfilled. The American
mills have been closed. Another three
years of the Gorman tariff would fulfill
the rest. The prices of European" goods
are already rising.
Tee cost of goods, however, is but half
of the problem. The more important
point is the effect which free trade has
upon the condition of the American peo
ple. As Mr. McKinley said: "Free trade
cheapens the article by cheapening the
artisan ; protection reduces the price of a
product by giving the artisan just reward
for his labor and receiving its reward on
higher skilled industry. Vree trade cheap
ens the product by cheapening the pro
ducer; protection cheapens the product
through the skilled genius and industry
of the producer."
In answer to the free-trade maxim,
"Buy where you can buy the cheapest,"
McKiniey gave to the people of Canton
the better maxim, "Buy where you can
pay the easiest." It is under a Bystem
of protection that affords employment to
labor that the American workingman can
most easily pay for the articles which he
needs to sustain his life. Labor receives
its highest rewards in America, and when
the American market is duly protected
labor can here most easily pay for the
comforts of life. We have had now three
years' experience with the Gormaiv. tariff,
and every workingman knows what the
tfiect has been upon him. The light of
that experience illumines the way for him
to walk in future, and there can certainly
be no doubt as to which way he will vote
if he is duly sensible of the lessons which
have been taught him by the hard times
of the Democratic depression.
It is a historical fact that when the
Republican administration went oat we
were in a time of great prosperity ; the
country was prosperous to an extent that
never before had been attained. It la
historically true that since the Demo
cratic policy has been brought into legis
lation the country had gone step by atep
from this pinnacle of prosperity to the
very depth of business depression and
distress.â Benjamin Harrison.

What puzzles the Nugget is this. The Popu

fusion that he arranged for his own benefit,
and that will, in the event oi the success of the
election of Populist or Democratic legislators,
result as he had planned. In one breath they
denounce the octopus and in the next instant

BLESSINGS.
Could the covetous heart of each mortal obtain
Its desires with naught of repayment ia fain
Or of grieving;
Were we quit, of perennial fault and forgiving,
We would surely find life was unworthy of living
or of leaving.
Nona but deep In theheart something bitter must
share
And it crosses.
Yet perhaps we may rind at the end of the road
That the chief ot the blessings by fortune be
stowed
Were our losses.
Fbank Putnam, in Chicago-Times Herald.
CAMPAIGN ECHOES
They say Mr. Bryan has an overwhelming
personal vanity. What's he vain about, any
how ?â Philadelphia Telegraph.
Mr. Bryan continues to inspect the rope* on
the parachute and talk of what will happen
in case he is tlefea ted.â Washington Post.
Bryan says: "It is not a time to listen to
personal ambition," Dick Bland on his farm
will kick the cat out of the way when he reads
this and sneers.â Wichita Eagle.
If we understand Mr. Bryan what the strug
gling masses need is a good 50-cent dollar that
will be interchangeable at par with Wall
street's 200-cent dollar.â Kansas City Journal.
Mr. Bryan has an idea that a composite pho

son and Abraham Lincoln would be an ac
curate likeness of William Jennings Bryan.â

"Come," said he, "let us reason together."

"Well, It Is; the puzzle is to find the free

"Two grave complaints are made againit the
Popocratic candidates," remarked the snake
editor to the horse editor.
"What are they?"
"Se wall won't put up and Bryan won't shut
up."â Pittsburg Chronicle-Telegraph.
We speak entirely without prejudice when
we say that Mr. Bryan'* canvass has done
himself irreparable injury. All the Republi
can and sound-money Democratic orators in
the country could not have harmed hira so
much as he has harmed himself. â Phila
delphia Times.
It is not a question of patriotism whether we
shall have a gold or a silver standard of money
in this country. Gold is as patriotic as silver.
The question is, Shall we keep abreast with
modern civilization or shall we tall back into
the ranks with Mexico and the South Ameri
cans ?â Chicago Times-Herald.
Mr. Bryan seems to consider that money
shall bo made of little or douotfol value in
order that people will be anxious to get rid cf
it, on the same principle that* dishonest man
who becomes the possessor of a counterfeit
bill Is anxious to pass It on his neighbor in
exchange for something valuable. â Nashville
Banner.
No American citizen who understands the
needs of his country advocates free trade.
Every man knows tnat to be impracticable.
Free silver, which means silver monometal
lism, is no lees objectionable. Bryanism
means both, and it is therefore hostile to
American interests and especially to American
labor.â Omaha Bee. _
As the phosphorescent glow of Mr. Bryan's
oratory continues to flicker around the land it
Is becoming more and more oDvious that the
issue of free silver plays but a small part in
the campaign, and that the only real danger
to be apprehended from tne efforts of the can
didates consists in their tendency to make the
poor bitterly hostile to the rich and begin a
warfare of classes among the American peo
ple.âBoston Herald.
OUR DOLLAR IS NOT "TOO GOOD."
Chicago Times-Herald.
It is incredible that the intelligent laboring
men of this country can be persuaded by Mr.
Bryan Into believing that the dollar we now
have is "too good." It is incredible that a
sane man should base his appeal to wage
workers to vote to change our currency on
the contention that the dollar now paid to
labor "buys too much."
And yet the "dear dollar" is the burden of
Mr. Bryan's complaint in all bis speeches. Are
there any wage-earners In Chicago who are
complaining because of the Increased pur
chasing power of a dollar? Does any laborer
lie awake nights worrying over the nervous
apprehension that when he gets up in the
morning his dollar may buy more loaves of
br.'ad than it did before the "crime of '73"?
Mr. Bryan belongs to the free-trade party
that has persistently and piteously howled
about the protective tariff, claiming that it
had a tendency to increase the prices of com
modities to the consumer. Witn lurid calum
niation and dolorous lamentation the lree
trade orators of Mr. Bryan's class have led
great gatherings, of labor into an uproar of
frenzied indignation over tho "tax" which the
"robber tariff barons" proposed to put on the
workinpman's dinner pail.
But Mr. Bryan is now exhorting laborers to
indorse a -'lax" that is a tax. He declares
that the prices of commodities are too low.
They must be raised by the free coinage of
silver jvi 16 to 1. He is now engaged in pic
lurins; to wage-earners the beauties of a new
kind of "crown of thorns," which says that the
contents of the workingman's dinner pail cost
too little. Does labor see the point ?
Letters From the People.
BISMARCK A BEVETALLIST.
The Efforts Made, to Misconstrue thÂ« Ger
â  â â  man Statesman's Jttecent Letter.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ
Several times the Examiner ; has published a
letter of Prince Bismarck, partly wrong in its
translation to suit '.their; cause best. And of
this letter the Examiner and Mr. Bryan him
self in several of his speeches , were boasting
and trying to mislead the people, by no means
an honorable * act. Bismarck at; the close of
the Franco-German war bad established the
gold standard with so great success known to
every one In the civilized world except I Mr.
Bryan.; Is any one believing that a man like
Bismarck, the ' greatest statesman of this cen
tury, would ; contradict himself so strongly T
It is absurd. In his : letter not one syllable
DointB to independent free coinage of silver;
in favoring bimetallism it says expressly by
mutual agreement, and at the close of the
letter it says again distinctly bimetallism by
International agreement. Consequently Bis
marck's views are in complete accordance with
the platform of the Republican party, in com
plete harmony with . William McKlnley, who
is advocating the very same : thing, bimetal- :
lism by international agreement. - : â 
Later on the Examiner produced the same
letter in the original German language and
here follows a correct translation :
â  ' -' Fbibdrichsbche, Aug. 24, 1896. .
; Honored Sir: Your esteemed of . July 1 has
been received. I always have : been in favor of
bimetallism, but while 1 was in office . would; not
consider myself Infallible in opposition to experts.
I believe to tuis day that it would be recommend
able to bring about between the nations chiefly en
gaged in the wond's commerce, a mutual agree
ment that has tne tendency to obtain Dime tall ism.
The United btates are â¢ freer by far In their
movements as any single nation on the European
continent and if North America should find It
would agree will with their Interests to take a
self-dependent step In the direction of bimetallism
I believe that such a step would exert a beneficial
influence upon (he establishment by International
agreement aud the joining with European States.
Assuring you of my highest respect I am your
most obedient servant, , V. Bismarck.
, Exactly as Bismarck has been misrepresent
ed the very same has been done with Dr.
Ahrendt. The Examiner from time to time
represented Dr. Ahrendt of Germany, who Is
a strong advocate of bimetallism (like Bis
marck), as an authority in favor of free Silver,
whereas it is well known Dr. Ahrendt is op
posed to free r silver and he has declared in
print that independent free coinage j of silver
will be : disastrous. ?.; Other prominent advo
cates of bimetallismâ Seyd, Schoenhoff, Pro
fessor Edward, Suess of Vienna, , Gibbs ana
Helm of England, Lavelleye of - Belgium, H.
Cermuschi of Italy, M. Paul Lerov-Beaulleu of
France, Professor : John' B. , Clark, Professor
' Andrews and Professor '. Francis A. : Walker â
have all declared that the unrestricted tree
' coinage of silver by any one Government now
maintaining a .: gold standard could not be
otherwise than disastrous. In fact, they de
clare in print that it would be calamitous.

WHEAT AND SILVER.
A. fopuliKt Argument Which Does Xot
Stand the 'Jest of Facts.
Ban Francisco, October 16, 1896.
Editor Morning Call â Sir: Free siiverites
claim that the price of silver has fallen only
when measured by goldâ that it has not fallen
when measured by farm products.
This claim has obtained currency on mere
assertion ; no proof of if has ever been offered.
The Call demonstrated its falsity recently
by citing the sharp advance in wheat,
amounting in Chicago to nearly 30 per cent
in two months, while silver was steadily
falling.
The last issue of the American Agricultur
ist contains an investigation of this subject
extending over a period of forty-live years â
since 1851â and shows that the purchasing
power of silver, when measured In wheat,
has declined 41 per cent during that time,
while gold, measured by wheat, bas remained
nearly stationary.
The Agriculturist 1^ absolutely free from po
litical bias and its discussion of the subject
deserves a wide circulation. Respectfully,
T. J. Daniels, 1777 Green street.
TWO AUTUMN SLEEVES
Smaller sleeves are no longer a mere rumor;
they have materialized In the fall gowns, and
though they are stylish, pretty and becoming,
they will not completely rout the larger shape,
for the full sleeve is too comfortable to be dis
carded entirely. But the woman who wishes
to keep abreast, or abend, rather, of the fash
ions will have at least one pair in her best
gown, probably.
The close-fitted sleeve, with full but short
draped puff, is the finest modei. It is made of
one or two fabrics. One seen was of green and
blue Dresden silk, with the puff of blue can
vas-cloth matching the waist and skirt.
Another vras entirely of the bilk of which the
gown was made.
The fitted sleeve is suitable for all fabrics. A
combination of materials may be employed in
making It. One was of Dresden silk, with the
puff or dark thin canvas-cloth of which the
wafst was made, having a bolero front, with a
blouse vest of the silk. The back of the waist
was smooth over a fitted lining, with a coat
basque laid in pleats and reaehlue only to the
under-arm seams.
A green mohair gown had the puffs of mo
hair, the lawn sleeves and a round yoke on the
waist being of embroidered batiste over a
Violet 3ilk lining.

LOS ANGELES SUFFRAGISTS
The Woman's Movement Advancing and
Prospering. . . Â
Los Aneeles bounty holds a unique position
in the suffrage army.
Although there was not in the beginning a
positive plan to stand alone, work independ
ently of all other suffragist organizations and
pay all her own bills, such.has come to be the
case, and a grand work of local organization
has been accomplished which will tell visibly
on election day. In thorough organization, as
in the petition work done in April and May,
this county has been acknowledged "the
banner county." Being the only one which
had started on the plan of precinct organiza
tion before the regular campaign commenced,
having held the first county convention ever
held in the Btate, it naturally took the lead in
this direction and was soon able to set the ex
ample toother counties.
The harmonious and co-operative response
to a call from county headquarters from
women in all the precincts made a wise finan
cial plan a possibility, and it is with just
pride that our suffragists declare that tney
have, without assistance from State or National
lund, defrayed all their expenses, paying good
salaries to the county president, county
speakers, county organizer and county corre
sponding secretary. During the series of con
ventions held throughout the State last
spring Los Augeles not only paid all the ex
penses of her convention, but contributed $67
in collections and subscriptions called for by
Miss Hay to the State fund.
Now, with the 3d of November almost upon
them, a busier set of women are not to be
found in all the State. Their commodious
headquarters, consisting of four large, airy
rooms in the Muskegon block on Broadway,
presents a busy, animated scene.
Every day from 9 a. m. to 5 P. M. Mrs. Lula
Pile Little, the energetic and efficient cor
responding secretary, is at her post, writing
letters, placing speakers in the field and other
wise discharging official duties. Mrs. Alraedia
B. Gray, the careiul, painstaking financial
secretary, is also in constant service at head
quarters. This lady is a. so vice-president of
the county campaign committee, and gives
her work gratuitously, besides paying a
monthly installment for the couuty fund.
Our president, Mrs. Lizzie H. Meserve, is well
known, not only here but in San "Francisco, as
a woman of fine executive ability, and under
her wise supervision the work goes smoothly
on in every detail.
The precincts of the county are now thor
oughly organized, each having its campaign
committee systematically working to educate
voters and collect the sinews of warâcam
paign lunds. Thousands of suffrage leaflets
have been distributed; city precinct meetings
have been held throughout the summer, aver
aging five to seven per dayâ the highest num
ber in one day in the city of Los Angeles being
nine â while a proportionate number are being
held in the country districts.
Wheu it is remembered that nil this work is
done by "home talent"â by the busy house
wives of the countyâ it Is not to be wondered
at that Los Angeles County men expect to vote
for the sixth amendment.
The Republican County Convention passed
a resolution indorsing the suffrage plank in
the state platform. These men know that it
is their own wives and mothers, sisters and
sweethearts who are asking for the ballot, and
in the spirit of true Caliioruian chivalry they
Intend to comply with the wishes of their own
women.
These women are modest and retiring as a
rule, and instead of "taking to the political
platform" themselves they have secured their
most eloquent brothers of all parties to plead
their cause at the various political meetings.
Their committee on public meetings, composed
of ladies and gentlemen from each party, bas
arranged for the presentatiou of the sixth
amandment at all political meetings in the
county from now till election.
At the meeting last Saturday evening when
Senator Perkins spoke to an immense throng
in Hazzard's Pavilion, the largest auditorium
in our city, he made a magnificent appeal to
the voters to remember the women and the
sixth amendment. The executive officers and
many members of the county campaign com
mittee were seated on the platform, having
been especially invited there by the Business
Men's Sound-Money Club, under whose
auspices this meeting wus held, and it goes
without saying that their hearts were cheered
by the loyal words of the Senator.
Many other kindly straws are coming our
way. We are all invited to seats on the plat
form next Wednesday night when we are to
listen to Hon. Ben Butterworth, who, we hear,
is a notable friend of our movement.
The Populists and Prohibitionists are also
our friends as of old, and the Democratsâ
though they did not give us a whole plank,
only a resolutionâ have granted us many
favors and we have every reason to hope that
our county will poll a large vote in favor of
the woman's amendment from all the parties.
Out of the seventy-four precincts organized
In this city it is impossible to find a man who
will join iii a debate against us, although three
men in the county have written against us
serai-occasionally.
The newspapers throughout the county are
very generous, many espousing our cause
editorially, ail of them giving space to contri
butions pro ana con on the subject.
It would bs a pleasure to mention the papers
that are for us and the men who are so nobly
aiding us by voice and pen, but it would
double the length of this letter.
When the dust and smoke of this battle has
cleared away we will "make a note on't" and
have something to say about our friends tried
and true. We are keeping a faithful record in
our hearts while our hands and brains are
busy, and they shall not be forgotten who
stood by us in the burden and heat of the day
of our struggle fur woman's political equality.
Alice Moore McComas,
Chairman L. A. (Jo. Press Committee.
THE GREATEST OF TRUSTS
Insatiable Greed of the Silver Mine
Oicners.
The owners of silver mines expect to profit
by paying their workmen in cheap dollarsâ
that Is, by reducing the wages of miners. As
a matter of fact, the free silver movement is a
conspiracy against the wages of all kinds of
ia borers. âSt. Louis Globe-Democrat.
The silver trust would at once take control
of the finances of the United States if Bryan
were elected. It would prove to be the most
gigantic trust or syndicate ever organized In
any corner of the world. The mine-owners
would be absolutely in control. They could
dictate to the United States Government while
they rolled up untold millions In private for
tunes. On a silver basis this trust would be
able to manipulate ana control legislation
everywhere. Not all of the so-called trusts
that now exist in this country put together
would be half so powerful as a silver trust
And yet this is what Bryan, Sewall, Watson,
Stewart and the others who demand free coin
age of silver are actually driving at. They
want to control the money of the Nation.
They would get rich through compulsory dis
honesty.âNew York Mail and Express.
Since silver was "struck down by the crime
of 1873" the mines of the United States alone
have produced 939,576,000 ounces. The
commercial value of this enormous yield,
reckoned at tne average price for each year,
was $943,083,000. The coinage value of the
total product, at the existing ratio, was
$1,214,751,000. So that if permitted to enjoy
the free coinage the mine-owners would have
made an "additional profit," as the circular
of their "finance committee" truly put it, of
$271,668,000. They would have made an ad
ditional profit" of $33,000,000 on the yield of
1894, and of $36,000,000 on the yield of 1895.
No wonder Mr. Morrill thought they "could
not afford not to give" the "additional profit
they would receive for their own silver
product for one month" to help elect a free
coinage Presidentâ New York World.
From 1873 to 1893 the mine-owners were in
the saddle. Tney passed the act of 1878, which
enabled them to coin $36,000,000 of their
silver on private account. What were left of
these coins were afterward redeemed by the
Government in money as good as gold, all at
the expense of the taxpayers. Afterward the
United States passed laws to furnish them a
market for $600,000,000 of their bullion, and
this has been depreciating in the hands of the
people and the Government, entailing a loss
of many millions. The "fat" of these men bas
come from the substance of the people. They
have obtained it as the result of lawb which
their attorneys have passed, but they are not
yet satisfied. They wish to continue the same
system on a larger scale, and to this end they
are asked to supply a fund to corrupt the bal
lot.âCourier-Journal.

Citizens' Non-Partisan Nominees Try to Modify
Their Pledges on the Charter.
Last Wednesday the Democratic nominees for the Legislature aent the followins:
communication to the Non-Partisans' campaign committee:
To the Chairman and Members of the Citizen? Non-Partisan Committee; The undersigned, after
a conference had for that purpose, beg leave, in fairness to themselves and to you, to submit
the following:
At the time of our nominations for Senators and Assemblymen in the respective Senatorial
and Assembly districts set out after our individual names, we were requested to sign a pledge
that we would vote for the new charter in the Legislature, if the same was carried by the vote
of San Francisco. After mature consideration we are all of the opinion that the pledge as
signed was inadvisedly taken, and should be modified to the extent that Assemblymen and
Senators, as to their votes in the Legislature, should be guided entirely by the vote of their
constituents on the charter in their respective Senatorial and Assembly districts.
The pledge as so modified is satisfactory to us. Without the modification we most respect
fully notify you that we cannot indorse it.
Hoping that you may see the fairness and justness of our modification and that you may
see your way clear to limit the original pledge in that regard, we have the honor to be, respect
fully, yours truly, SAMUEL BRACXHART, Seventeenth Senatorial District.
HUGO K. ASHER, Twenty-first Senatorial District.
EUGENE F. LACY, Twenty-eighth Assembly District.
JOHN ALLEN. Twenty-ninth Assembly District
EUGENE J. riANNON, Thirtieth Assembly District.
JAMES P. BRADY, Thirty-first Assembly District
JOHN POWER, Thirty-second Assembly District.
GEORGE B. GODFREY, Thirty-third Assembly District.
WILLIAM N. GATELY, Forty- fifth Assembly District.
This led to a spirited discussion in political circles on the point as to whether a
man or any number of men had a right to modify such a pledge without the consent
of the person holding the pledge, and the public has evinced a desire to know just
how the pledge was worded. Here is the document as it appears of record in the office
of the secretary of the Non-Partisan campaign committee :
LEGISLATIVE PLEDGE.
i
I hereby promise that if I am elected to
the Legislature I will, by my vote and in
fluence s endeavor to secure the adoption of
the new charter in its entirety and without
amendment by the Legislature.
And I do also promise that I will, by my
vote and influence, prevent the passage of
any legislative enactment that shall in any
manner impair the usefulness or destroy the
efficiency of the present Australian ballot
law or the so-called purity of election law.
And I further pledge myself not to vote
for any candidate for the United States Sen
ate who will not pledge himself to vote
against any bill in the United States Senate
having for its purpose the refunding of the
indebtedness of the Pacific railways.

Among Non-Partbans this effort of the Democratic legislative nominees to crawl
out of a pledge given in exchange for an indorsement was the subject of heated dis
cussion yesterday.
George K. Fitch, chairman of the Non- Partisan campaign committee, was one of
the few members of the organization who did not seem to be perturbed on account of
the unfortunate outcome of the committee's attempt to bind the Democratic nominees
to a support of the charter.
"We as an organization have nothing further to offer in regard to the matter,"
said Mr. Fitch. "We accepted the pledges in good faith and the incident was closed
so far as we were concerned."
The philosophic view entertained by Mr. Fitch is not shared by many of his asso
ciates on the committee, however. According to the theory of the committee, as
evinced by declining to consider the communication from fciamuel Braunhart and his
associates, the pledge still remains in force as against these gentlemen, notwithstand
ing their attempt to sneak out of it. But this theory is merely nominal, and is not
seriously accepted even by a majority of the members of tte campaign committee.
By the rank and file of the Non-Partisan organization it is rejected and repudiated
altogether, and as Mr. Braunhart and his associates in this thing have disgraced
themselves the Non-Parlisan voters will, of course, find it impossible to lend sup
port to such persons.
Certain .Republican nominees for the Legislature who were indorsed by the Non-
Partisan party made application to be re-enforced by a supplemental indorsement or
commendation, thinking that they were entitled to something of the kind in order to
distinguish them from the persons who tried to go back on their words.
In reply to this suggestion the Republicans were told: "You don't need that.
You are all right. You haven't made any mistake. The other fellows are the ones
who ought to be hustling for additional indorsements."
Members of the Non-Partisan party point out that there wera three important
subjects covered by the pledge signed by the legislative nominees who secured their
indorsement. It is held that the charter clause is of no greater importance than the
clauses in regard to the Australian ballot law and the refunding of the railroad debt.
If those Democratic nominees have grown so tender about pledging themselves on
the charter question (after having secured an indorsement that they greatly coveted)
it is asked why they did not seek similar freedom for themselves in regard to the
refunding bill and the ballot law.
Gentlemen woo have good memories for political affairs say that this is but
another dodge on the part of men who represent the old Nullification idea; such men
as do not repard the binding quality of a promise; but who deem that their troth
may be loosely or "inadvisedly" given. Such persons, not being confined to the
strait and narrow path whicn gentlemen of honor pursue, think they may be per
mitted to play fast and loose with tnose who accept their pledges. Such persons
assume that they have the privilege to "modify" at will their solemn promises, and
yet hope to go unscathed and unpunished, though they know full well that they
deserve the contempt of all who despise low-down cunning and double-dealing in
pnbhc affairs.

REPUBLICANISM
IN THE SOUTH
Senator Flint Believes Mc-
Kinley Will Carry
California.
How He Regards the Situation
in Three Important
Counties.
OF IMPORTANCE TO FARMERS
The Reinstatement of the Former
Tariff Will Be of Great Value
to the State.
Among the arrivals at the Grand Hotel
yesterday was Senator Thomas Flint of
San Juan. The Senator has lately been
about a good deal in Monterey, Santa
Cruz and San Benito counties. Having
been renominated for State Senator, he
has had occasion to go over his district
SENATOR THOMAS FLINT of San Joan, Who Tells of the
Campaign Where He Has Been.
{Sketched from life by a "Call" artist.]
and also to visit some other parts of the
State.
Senator Flint believes that the outlook
for Republican success this year in Cali
fornia is very good indeed. He thinks
that the sober second thought of the voters
has returned, if, in fact, the voters ever
seriously thought of renouncing a party
which has accomplished so much for the
good of the people. He says, too, that as
the campaign advances, so far as he has
been able to judge, the enthusiasm for
Major McKinley has grown constantly.
The majority of tne people believe, as he
thinks, that with McKinley and his prin
ciples will come safety and solidity of
business. The faijt that the people are
seeing more and more that protection is
invaluable to the interests of the State
has caused the number of McKinley men
to increase.
"I have not had much occasion to go
over the Stale," said Senator Flint yester
day, "and I havo made no speeches out
side of my district, but I have been in
Santa Croz, Monterey and throuehout
San Benito considerably. Ido not think
there will be much cDange in these coun
ties: the combined vote will be about
the same. In my own county I antici
pate that the vote will be about the same
as when Mr. Budd was elected two years
ago.
"It has been a pretty quiet campaign,
generally speaking. There liave been no
county officers to elect, and that makes a
great deal of difference in the local inter
est. Yet, as the campaien advances it is
plain to see that the interest and enthu
siasm are growing steadily.
"In my section of the State trie people
are emphatically in favor of protection,
because we are larre producers of sugar
beets. We produce these in portions of
Santa Cruz, Monterey and San Benito
counties, and they are a very important
crop. Protection means a good deal to
the farmers and everybody else* in these
counties. If you can show a man that
protection means an additional price of
fifty cents a ton for beets, it is an argu
ment that reaches him; *U has its effect,
and he will be in favor of the protection
that protects him in the industry of beet*
raising.
"The former price for beets under the
tariff and bounty was $4 50to$5aton,
and beetu are now worth at, tbe factory $4
a ton. If a duty should be imposed
equivalent to 2 cent 3 a pound on sugar, it
is expected that the price for beets will be
restored. It is safe to say that my section
of the country haÃ by repeal of the McKin
ley bill lost at least $200,000. That is a
very important sum, and if it had been
distributed among our people it would
have greatly aided in making times easy
and money plentiful. The people down
â¢ here are seeing this and they want the
McKinley tariff restored. They say that
n will do a great deal ior that part of the
State.
"Mr. Spreckels will crush, I suppose, in
that section 125,000 tons of beets this year.
If a factory be put in at Salinas, our peo
ple will raise as many more, so that the
effect of a tariff, as voiced by Major Me-
Kinley, would mean greatly increased
prosperity down our way.
"1 do not see that anything could well
be more important to us than this. It
certainly applies directly to' the counts 1
have mentioned. And in a general way, I
must say I think protection to the other
interests* of the State, as comprehended
in the McKinley bill, is of the tirst im
portance to all the people of the State.
"Now, as to the majority McKinley
ought to get, I will say that I place it at
no less than about 5000. He ought to get
that from the way things now Jook. I
estimate this on the basis of the vote cast
two years ago, and if things continue for
the next two weeks as they ure now go
ing."
Senator Flint is only making a brief
slay here. ____^_________
WILL GET THEIR PAY.
Auditor Broderick Will Sign the War
rants of Many Municipal Km
plo.yes To-Day.
There were many happy hearts in the
new City Hall yesterday when it became
known that Auditor Broderick would
sign the warrants of the clerks in the
offices that were affected by the tenure of
om'ce decision of the Supreme Court.
Mr. Broderick's reason for signing the
warrants is that the Supreme Court in its
decision in the suit recently brought by
the Election Commissioners ignored the
question of salaries entirely, leaving the
matter of signing the warrants in the
hands of the Auditor.
This move is expected to remove much
of the opposition that the Auditor's previ
ous course had created.
Slass-Meeting for Young Men.
To-morrow afternoon at 3 o'clock there will
be a general mass-meeting in the Young Men's
Christian Association building, Mason and
Ellis streets. Addresses will be made by C. 0.
Michener of New York City, John L. Speares
and other delegates. Tho service will be tree
to all young men. Kpecial service and an ex
ceedingly interesting service maybe expected.
Attendance will be limited to men between
16 and 45 years of age.
Town Tnlk's Popularity.
Town Talk, San Francisco's up-to-date
Weekly, is deservedly popular, because it con
tains exactly what the best class of readers
want â the topics of the current week handled
in a reliable, forcible, crisp manner, inter
spersed with handsome illustrations. Town
Talk is thoroughly independent and its edi
torial opinion is always expressed in the most
fearless manner. In this week's issue the
clergy of all denominations who take politics
into the pulpit are handled without gloves.
The front cover is embellished with a half-tone
portrait of Miss Elizabeth Carroll, a society
belle, from a photograph taken for Town Talk.
"Editorial Aftermath" discusses in no uncer
tain terms the decision of the Supreme Court
in upholding tho recent action of the Repub
lican Secretary of State. The society, dramatic
and musical departments are replete with
bright criticisms and the latest news.

WAR ON JUDGE HEBBARD
People's Home Eank Depositors
Begin a Bitter Fight
Against Him.
E even Thousand of Them Will Re-
taliate for His Appointment of
G neral Sbeeban.
The depositors of the People's Home
Savings Bank have determined to make
an organized fight against Judge Hebbard,
the Non-Paitisan nominee for Superior
Judge. They have been workine toward
this end for some time past, and are now
fully decided on the course of action to be
pursued in their campaign against the
Judge, which is to be opened at once all
over the City and wherever a nucleus of
the unfortunate depositors exists.
This tight is first of all to assume
definite shape in the nature of an appeal
to the voters of San Francisco setting
forth the misfortunes of the People's
Bank depositors and their attitude toward
the institution. The appeal has already
been written and is now in the- printer's
bands. So within a few days it may be
expected that it will be spread broadcast
throughout San Francisco.
The executive committee of the de
positors has charge of the work of pub
lishing and distributing the appeal in cir
cular form. As there are about 11,000 de
positors in all, and each one will be given
an opportunity to constitute himself a
committee of one to further distribute the
appeal, it is believed by the executive
committee that this battle will assume
immense proportions.
Judge Hebbard appointed General
Sheehan receiver of the bank about May
1, 1894. The appointment was made in
an action brought by the people of Cali
fornia upon the relation of Attorney-
General Hart against the bank, but it was
subsequently held by the Supreme Court
that the appointment was in excess of the
jurisdiction of the court and was void.
Shortly after the appointment wa^ made
another suit was begun, that of Nathan
Goldtree versus the directors and stock
holders of the bank. This suit was based
on averments of fraudulent conduct on
the part of the former directors, and Gen
eral Sheehan was appointed receiver by
Hebbard in this suit also.
Sheehan continued to act as receiver
under those appointments until January,
1895, when the receivership proceedings
were nullified by the Supreme Court. So
there was never any valid or legal re
ceivership of the bank. What has most of
all aroused the indignation of the deposit
ors is that they believe between $12,000 and
143,000 was sanandered by the manage
ment during the term of receivership.
The executive committee maintains that
the appointment of Sheehan was essen
tially a political one, because he knew
nothing of banks and banking and still
less of handling bonds, securities and the
finances of a banking institution. Acting
under this conviction they have prepared
to wage a vigorous war against Judge
Hebbard.

A WEEK OF SPORTS.
Notes of the Gun, the Rod, the Wheel, the
Oar and the Ring*
The sportsmen will take advantage to
morrow of the first Sunday of the season
for shooting ducks and quail. They do
not anticipate good shooting, however, as
the weather is altogether too warm.
Oarsmen are now training hard for the
regatta, and the local scullers expect to
turn the tables on the Stockton boys when
they will meet on the waters of this bay.
According to the number of clubs that
now bold permits to give boxing enter
tainments fisticuffs will be very lively this
winter.
The \oung Men's Christian Association
will hold its annual field day this after
noon on the Presidio athletic grounds.
GUN AND GAME.
Fine Weather and Poor Duck-
ShootlnÃâ A Good Storm Wanted.
Although Thursday was the opening
day of the season for the shooting of quail
and duck very little sport was enjoyed by
those who looked forward to bagging
large numbers of game.
It is not because of the decrease in the
game supply that poor shooting resulted
in the marshes which are frequented by
wild fowls. Mallard, sprig and teal are
more numerous than ever in the Suisun
marshes, but the birds quickly left their
nocturnal haunts when the early morn
ing fusillade commenced, and this was
owing to a most beautiful morning and
the absence of rain and wind.
As every sportsman is aware, wild ducks
will not remain inland wlien the weather
is calm, but the first good storm will cer
tainly bring about some grand sport, and
the sportsmen who will be in the Suisun
marshes during the blow may count upon
scoring large bags of game.
The present weather is altogether too
fine for duck-shooting, and local hunters
need not expect much shooting until the
arrival of the first good storm.
What scheme the lessees of preserve
lands about Suisun contemplate during
the next month with a view of keeping
trespassers off the mudflats is decidedly
hardly to guess. Some of the leaders of
the clubs who have been fighting the out
side hunters for some years past say that
they will continue the battle to the end
regardless of expense. But the member?
of the clubs who are much less hostile
than the leaders have become disgusted
and threaten to resign.
The hunters who are fighting the pre
serve men do not hesitate to say that tuey
will remain by their guns and contest
every inch of ground, as they bÂ« lieve that
no man has any particular righc to the
migratory game which frequents march
lands,
The hunters further contend that if they
are enjoined from shooting on the Sui
sun marshes a local ordinance will be
passed closing the duck-shooting season
in Solano County for a period of five
years. As matters now stand time alone
will determine the outcome of the present
war which is existing between the hunters
and the lessees of wild duck-preserves.
The San Francisco and North Pacific
Coast Railroad has done more Jooking to
the pleasure of sportsmen and anglers
than the other companies combined. Tuis
season the Ban Francisco and North Pa
cific Company will run a special hunters'
train to the duck-shooting marshes of So
noma. Their card says that commencing
on October 17, and each Saturday there
after, a hunters' train will connect at
Tiburon with the Tiburon ferry-boat,
which will leave this City at 11:30 p. m.,
and a special run will be made to Ign.icio,
Black Point, Reclamation, Sears Point,
McGills, Rchellville, Novato and Burdells.
Cars will be sidetracked at Black Point,
Reclamation, McGills, Schellviiie and
Burdells, in which the hunters can re
main until the early morning. This grand
inducement on the part of a liberal rail
road company should certainly receive tbe
support and appreciation of the sports
men of this City and County.
After the first good storm the duck
shooting on the Sonoma marshes will be
good.
Some very eood baes of quail were
made on Thursday by members of the
Country and Tamalpais Gun clubs. Six
sportsmen who shot over the quail
grounds near Point Reyes bagged 259 birds
on the opening day of the season.
The following lettÂ«r to Secretary Fitz
siamons of the State Sportsmen's Pro
tective Association is self-explanatory :
Charlts Fitzsimmons, Esq., Secretary State
Sportsmen's Protective AssoeiationâDE&u Sir:
I nave the honor to acknowledge the receipt of
your communication of October 8 recommend
ing John H. Sammi lor the position oi State
Fish and Game Commissioner and the same
has been filed for Governor Budd's considera
tion when he is prepared to make appoint
ments on the board. Yours truly,
J. M. Todman, Executive Secretary.
THE WHEELMEN.
Two Trials Against the World's Flve-
Mlle Record To-Morrow.
There ha 3 been so much talk about incor
rect timing and scoring in connection with
the associated clubs' big ten-mile road
race last Sunday that the road-racing and
records' committee has called a meeting
of all officials for next Monday evening at
8 o'clock, at the rooms of the Olympic
Club Wheelmen, to complete the score and
hear protests. All officials are requested
to bring any memoranda and evidence
they can get in regard to those riders who
finished between the sixteenth and thir
tieth positions.
But after all there is little blame resting
on the officials, and certainly nothing but
credit lor the road-racing committee.
When the matter is simmered down it
will be found that the timers made a cleri
cal mistake of one minute and ten sec
onds in figuring the scratch men's time,
which was easily corrected ; that the scor
ers missed recording two or three men
who finished, and as they finished aiter
sixteenth place and there were only
twenty place prizes, it made little differ
ence; in fact, the scorers had the record
of two men who finished minus tueU dis
tinguishing numbers, and it was no fault
of theirs that these men were left out of
the table.
The officials of the race feel that they
did their best, and that best was as well as
the work could have been possibly done;
and naturally they are considerably hurt
over an article which appeared in an
evening paper dwelling on their gross in
competency and the fast that they were
appointed because of their "pull" with the
racing board. Timers Wetmore, Bailey,
Burris, Hadenfeldt, Sharpe or Fawcett
were appointed for their ability in that
line; Judge* Kerrigan, Coffrotb, Pixley
and the others for their honesty and im
partiality, and as for the scorers, Scovern,
Hyde, the Hall brothers and myself, we
feel that we did our best and did it well,
and that we could give lessons to the man
who wrote the article referred to.
The excellent condition oi the San Le
andro-Haywards course this week has in
duced S. B. Vincent to try for the record
to-morrow. He will be paced by the
quadruplet manned by G. E. Dixon, C. A.
Kraft, T. A. Griffiths and John L. David
son, and also three Bay City tandem
teamsâ Languetin and Kanzee, the Men
dell brothers and King Rhys and "Happy
Jack" Lorentz. The general opinion is
that Vincent will not break the record.
C. M. Smith of the Olympic Cyclers will
also probably make a trial for the record
over the new Olympic-Garden City course
starting near Mi, pitas. Smith is a speedy
rider, and as the course is a fast one he
should make excellent time.
The ban Francisco Road Club and Cali
fornia Cycling Club abandoned their relay
race at the Chutes, after riding several
evenings and then finding that the dials
on the training machines varied consider
ably. Altogether it was rather an unsatis
factory contest.
Chief Consul Kerripan of the North
California Division, League of American
Wheelmen, desires an owner for a valuabie
pocketknife which had been undoubtedly
dropped by a wheelman and was found by
one recently and turned over to the chief
consul. The knife, while not valuable
enough perhaps to justify advertising its
loss, is yet one whicu was probably greatly
esteemed by its owner.
The California Associated Cycling
Clubs will hold its annual theater party
next Wednesday evening at the Tivoli.
Almost every seat in the house has been
sold to wheelmen and their lady friends,
and the prominent clubs have engaged
blocks of seats. The prizes won in Jast
[Sunday's road race will be distributed after
the performance.
Bicycle collisions are a species of acci
dent that it is wise to avoid, not only on
account of the danger to life and limb,
but because a bicycle, though built to
withstand rough use, is not bound to be
accident proof against the force of a col
lision. Stop and think for a moment of
the damage that may ensue from the col
liding of two b:cycle-riders in rapid mo
tion. A man weighing ISO pounds and
moving at the rate of twelve feet a second
(which is but a trifle over eight miles an
hour) has a momentum of 1800 pounds,
and this leaves out of account altogether
the weight of the wheeL This is sufficient
to upset any pedestrian with terrific force.
A collisionbelween two wheeis, each car
rying a 180-pound rider, running along at
the moderate speed of eight miles an hour,
would result in a smashup with a force of
nearly 4000 pounds.
The California Cycling Club will give an
entertainment and dance this evening at
Mission Parlor Hall, Seventeenth street,
near Valencia.
The Imperial Cycling Club will meet at
the cluDrooms Monday night and en
deavor to christen the punchbowl won by
the members in the recent wheelmen's
I parade. On Sunday, the 25th, there will
be a ten-mile road race over the Haywards
course, and Friday evening, the 30th, a
party at Odd Fellows' Hall.
The annual election oi the North Cali
ornia division of the League of American
Wheelmen is now in progress, the voting
being by mail ballot Irom the 15th to the
25th inst. The regular ticket is as follows,
there being but one contest, that for the
office of secretary-treasurer: For chief
consul, Frank H. Kerrigan of San Fran
cisco; for vice-consul, Henry F. Wynne of
Ban Francisco; for secretarj'-treasurcr,
! Lew s C. Hunter of San Francisco and
j Stanley G. Scovern of San Francisco; for
representatives at large (eight) â James
W. Coffrotb of San Francisco, Francis T.
Dwyer of Sacramento, John S. Egan of
San Francisco, Frank K. Lippitt of Peta
luma, W. I. Pixley of San Franci&co,
George H. Strong of Oakland, George H.
Stratton of San Francisco and A. P. Swain
of Oakland.
Hunter and Scovern, each of whom
wants the secretary - treasurership, are
both Olympic Club Wheelmen, and have
for a long time past been actively con
nected with the sport. Mr. Hunter has
been secretary of the Olympic Club Wheel
men for several successive terms and also
secretary- treasurer of the California Asso
ciated Cycling Clubs. He has been prom
inent in many ways in cycling, ha 9 con
tributed considerably to cycling literature
f and nas a strong following. Mr. Scovern
has been captain of the old San Francisco
Bicycle Club, captain of the Olympic Club
Wheelmen, cycling editor of the Chron
icle and a correspondent for the Pacific
Cyclist, Cycling West, the Olympic,
Cycling, Field Sports and other class pub
lications, and is the. incumbent of the
office he now seeks for another term. It
is generally conceded that the present
administration of the league's affairs in
this State has been the most prosperous in
the history of the division, with not a
little credit accruing to Secretary-Treas
urer Scovern for the good work he has
done.
Captain Day led the Bay City Wheel
men on a moonlight run to Sutro's last
evening. Next Wednesday night the club
will attend the associated clubs' theater
party at the Tivoli, having reserved a
large block of seats.
F. A. Wickersnam and F. K. Lippitt of
the Petaluma Wheelmen have been in the
City during the past week.
The Garden City Cyclers of San Jose
will hold a race meet on their three-lap
â  cement track Saturday afternoon, October
31. Wells and McFarland, the Californians
who have been following the Eastern cir
cuit, will have returned by that time and
â  will probably compete. H. E. McCrea of
| Lcs Angeles has returned from his Alas
, kan trip and is in training now for this
meet and those to be held at the Velo
drome.
Otto Ziegler Jr. and his trainer, R. P.
Aylward, are expected back from the East
next Week. Ziegler broke his arm a fort
night ago in a race and will not be able to
ride for a couple of months.
The Century Road Club of America
makes no distinction between paced, un
paced or competitive performances on the
road, or whether a course be straightway or
not, but it is expected a provision will
shortly be made for such differences, in
which event H. A. Goddard's ride of 12:13
unpaced will stand as the coast record.
This is the gist of a letter just received
from Will L. Krietenstein, chairman ot
the road records committee. He also
states that the only California records on
the road are Hamlin's five miles, 11:11 2-5,
Byrne's ten miles, 24:27, and Wells'
twenty-five miles, 1:10 :30 2-5. There is no
coast record for 15, 20, 50, 100 or 200 miles.
It would seem that there is an oversight
on the part of somebody, as Kraft's
twenty-mile record and Sorensen's 100 and
200 mile rides should have been registered
long ago.
The following letter speaks for itself:
At a joint meeting of the Phoenix and Waver
ley Cycling clubs it was unanimously resolved
to merge the two clubs into one, adopting the
name and style of Waverley Cycling Club and
the emblem of the Phoenix Club. The regular
meeting of the Waverley Cycling Club then
took place and the following officers were
elected for one year : P. Allen Joy, 322 Second
avenue, president; P. Schonig, 1713 Scott
street, vice-president; S. W. Elston, 26 McAl
lister street, secretary and treasurer; W. Jur
gensen, 811 York street, captain; H. Heinze,
412 McAllister street, sergeant-at-arms; execu
tive committeeâ Frank Lowe, 214 Golden Gate
avenue; H. A. Evens, 1015 Post street: A. Ehr
hanlt, 707 Market street; P. A. Joy, S. VV.
Elston, W. Jurgenseu.
The above amalgamation gives the Waverley
Club a large and influential membership
Clubrooms are at 438 Golden Gate avenue.
S. W. Elston, Secretary.
Louis M. Getz, Albert Getz and George
M. Leavitt of the Barker Cycling Club
Frank W. Tiddy of the Pacific Cyclin<*
Club, E. L. Cutting and A. L. Young of
this City, joined the League of American
Wheelmen this week. The total member
ship of the league is now 67,464, of which
California numbers 2027.
AMATEUR ATHLETICS.
Good Sport at the Young Men's
Christian Association Field Day.
The programme as arranged by Howard
Taylor, the leader at the Olympic Club for
winter pastimes, is an evidence that the
club means to afford its members several
evenings of good sport from now until the
close of the year. The first event on the
programme is a swimming tournament,
which will be held on the evening of the
30th inst., and as there are several good
swimmers in the club some exciting con
tests will assuredly be witnessed. Owing
to the very little interest that ia maai
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 17. 1896.
fested by the members in outdoor ath
letics, the club will give but little atten
tion to this branch of sport until such
time as the boys will commence to train
in earnest for some event of consequence.
The following letter from George D.
Baird, the ex-champion walker, is self
explanatory:
San Francisco. Oct. 14, 1896.
Editor Morning Callâ Dear Sir: I have re
ceived a communication from the editor of the
New York Clipper stating that the record for
hammer-throwing made by Tnomas Carroll at
Fruitvale, Cal., on July 10 has been accepted.
Mr. Carroll's performance was 153 feet, ac
complished with a 16-pound hammer in a
7-foot circle. It is not often that I take an
interest in the performances of professionals,
but Mr. Carroll is of the Caledonian type; and
he has so far impressed me with his honesty
of purpose that i was glad to help him in his
endeavor by sending the affidavit to the editor
of the Spirit of the Times, who turned it over
to the editor of the Clipper. The friends of
this athlete can congratulate him on being
recognized by the Eastern sporting journals
as the foremost hammer-thrower of all the
world. George D. Baird.
San Francisco, Oct. 16, 1896.
Sporting Editor San Francisco Call, ( ityâ Dear
Sir: As the State athletic field day takes place
on Saturday, October 17, on which occasion
the main California associations of the You-ng
Men's Christian Association will compete, and
knowing that the inclosed will interest your
readers. I kindly ask you to insert the same in
to-niorrow's columns. Thanking you in an
ticipation I remain, yours truly,
H. L. Dietz, M. D., Physical Director.
A number oi new systems for gymnastic and
athletic contests have recently been arranged,
one of which the most interesting has been
adopted by the Young Men's Christian Asso
ciation of North America. It is called the
pentathlon, or fivefold athletic contest. As
all gymnastics or athletics should have for
their prime object the healthy- development
and education of the body it has become neces
sary to work out such rules and events that
would tend to further this object. The pen
tathlon contest of the Young Men's Christian
Association is the outcome of persistent studies
of modern and ancient physical education.
It is the obj.'et of that system to produce the
all-round athlete in preference to the "special
ist." Any mnn who desires to win the laurels
of this peuthalon has to excel in a number of
events that cal for a superiority of training,
development and action.. The contestant is
obliged to enter the five following events: 100
-yard dash, running high jump, throwing 12
-pound hammer, pole vault, mile run.
The athlete who is successful in this mani
fold contest proves that he has carefully and
normally trained himself and has accom
plished tiie object of the penthalon, namely,
the all-round healthy development and educa
tion of his body. You can readily see that the
first event brings into play principally the
muscle? of the leg, momentous control of same
and the immense amount of energy and agil
ity required for sprinting the distance in the
qr.ickest possible time. The running high
jump brings into play the leg, back and ab
dominal muscles particularly. Trie third
event, throwing the 12-pound hammer, under
these rules is different from the usual hammer
throw, as it must be thrown without a turn.
This event requires concerted action oi the
back, shoulders and arms, and is the strength
test of the penihalon.
A good pole-vaulter must use good judg
ment, be skillful, and be able to bring into use
his mental and muscular activity. The chief
element of success in the rni.e run is endur
ance supported by good lungs and muscular
power. The contestant can score in each
event 100 points. GolU medals are awarded
each contes'.Rnt scoring over 400 points, silver
medals to those scoring 300 and over, and
bronze medals to those scoring 200 points.
The medals are furnished by the international
athletic committee of the Young Men's Cnris
tian Association of America. The first Y. M.
C. A. State meet was held at Los Angeles, Oc
tober, 1895, and the San Francisco team won
the tropny, which was a handsome silk ban
ner, presented by the J. J. Pfister Knitting
Company.
In these contests each individual association
is allowed to enter a team of eight men, the
three best of these constituting the team
record in competition for championship
honors. The following was the official score:
San Francitco 1009 points, Los Angeles 928
points, Oakland 788 points.
THE OARSMEN.
Pacific Athletic Association Sanc
tioned the Hoidln&r cf a Regatta.
The Pacific Athletic Association at its
recent meeting sanctioned the big regatta
which is to be held ou Oakland Creek on
Thanksgiving day, and S. J. Pembroke,
the commissioner of rowing and chairman
of the iegatta committee, has completed
all arrangements for the affair.
The regatta will be held under the aus
pices of the Pacific Athletic Association,
and the list of events will be somewhat
different to the usual regatta programme.
Instead of having all amateur races there
will be an old-time oarsmen's race and a
cutter race between crews from the Naval
Reserve and warships which may be in
the harbor at the time.
A handsome trophy will be put up for
this event and as the Naval Reserve boys
have been anxious to try conclusions with
some of tiie United States navy oarsmen
they will be given a chance in the coming
regatta to settle the question of supremacy.
Tee race will be rowed n the six-oared
cutters, with a cockswain, and will be over
the regulation mile and a half course with
a turn. As the United States battle-ship
Oregon and the monitor Monadnock are
in port at present an invitation will be ex
tended them to get a crew in training for
the event.
Dr. Cecil Dennis, a champion rower of
the Alameda Boat Club, but now a mem
ber of the South End Club and lieu
tenant of the Naval Reserve, is doing all
in his power to, engender an interest in
rowing races among the battalion mem
bers, and an effort will be made to have
cutter races between crews from the dif
ferent companies of the reserve a semi
annual occurrence.
Another feature of the great regatta
will be the outrigger skiff race between
old-time oarsmen.
With such men as Henry Peterson, the
champion sculler; Jack Dunphy, John T.
Sullivan, Dan Leahy, Charles Long, Wil
liam Growney, Dan Dougherty, William
Thomas and other old-time cracks
matched to row a race the public will be
treated to a contest as exciting as they
used to enjoy in the heyday of rowing,
when these men were in their prime.
A junior outrigger skiff race has been
added to the regatta programme, and the
lift of events to be rowed will be as fol
lows: Senior single scull, senior and
junior outrigger skiff, senior barge, inter
mediate bartre, cutter race, old-timers'
outrigger skiff race, and probably a race
between a crew from the Columbia and
University Boat clubs.
The Pioneer Rowing Club celebrated its
thirty-second anniversary last Sunday at
the boathouse on Long Bridge. The day
was spent at boat-racing, singing, dancing
and other pastimes.
In the boatraces the following crews of
the club contested:
Junior erew â C. Darragh, bow; Tom
Faulkner, forwardwaist; Dick Callopy,
afterwaist; William St. John, stroke, and
Jim Brennan, coxswain.
Temperance Social Club erew â M. Cala
nan, bow; J. Klunder, forwardwaist; W.
Espy, afterwaist; R. J. Espy, stroke, and
Tommy Sands, cockswain.
The race was won by the latter crew,
but as there was some mistake in turning
the stakeboats the referee, Joe Brennan,
ordered the race rerowed to-morrow at 12
o'clock.
The next race was won by the old men's
crew, composed of John T. Sullivan, Jim
Brennan, Joe Brennan and W. Espy.
They defeated the young men's crew of
the following personnel: Joe Foley, Ed
Pannaugb, Fred Paunaupb, W. Cook and
D. Callopy, cockswain.
Judge Campbell with his whiskers
officiated as referee.
.': The Pioneers 5. have given an order for
two outri ger skiffs to J. Kennerson, a
local boatbuilder, i and will enter some
very fast men in these events in the com

CRICKET CHIRPS.
The Defeat of California by the
Australians.
Now that the Australians have come,
conquered and departed, a few reflections
on the local cricket event of the decade
may be in order. That our eighteen-strong
team should have suffered defeat at the
hands of such consummate masters of the
game as Trott and his star combination
was almost inevitable. But our Eastern
brothers will surely comment on the fact
that after disposing of so strong a batting
aggregation for 193 runs we made so
miserable a showing with the bat. The
visitors themselves were surprised at this,
for the bowling of Robertson and Cookson
aud the fielding of Butt, Hogue, Robert
son, Hood and others Lad led them to
expect greater opposition when they took
the field. How was their anticipation
realized?
With the exception of Keeling of Lake
County, who, in both innings, made the
top score, playing over after over of the
deadly bowling with confidence and accu
racy; of Bowhiil, Simmonds (who shaped
well) and Hogue, what account did all our
reputed haisrnen giveof themselves? They
fell like tenpins before the hurricane balls
of Jones and the crafty breakers of Don
nar and McKibbin.
The result of the big match seems to
point a very obvious moral, viz., that the
Batting practice hitherto indulged in has
been wholly ineffective. It is no practice
at all to stand at the nets and slog full
pitches and lobs about the field. But how
often have men the chance, on a Thursday
or Saturday afternoon, of getting anything
better? It could surely be arranged so
that at least one of our best bowlers should
be on hand on these occasions and do a
litt.e amateur coaching.
Some day we may run to a professional
ground bowierand systematized coaching,
but in the meanwhile an effort should be
made to better the existing order of
things.
The Penryn team will arrive in this
City on Friday and play Saturday and
Sunday the Pacifies and Alamedas.
Which club they will meet first has yet to
b<> arranged.
To-morrow the Pacifies and Californias
will have their final bout of the season at
Alameda. Umpire.
THE BOXERS.
Jack McAuMffe Is Expected Here
Sundayâ San Francisco Club.
At a meeting of the Health and Police
Committee of the Board of Supervisors
yesterday the following clubs were
granted permits to give boxing entertain
ments: St. George Club for November
instead of September, the California Club
for November and December, the Golden
West Club for November and December.
Tom Tracey, the Australian pugilist,
deposited $250 as a forfeit for a match
with George Green at 145 pounds. Tracey
acknowledged that he made a mistake
when he agreed to fight Green at caich
weight.
Jack McAoliffe is due in this City on
Sunnay, and when his ship comes in a
large gathering of the champion's friends
will be at the wharf to give him a royal
welcome. McAuliffe is matched to fight
Jimmy Carroll in November under the
auspices of the St. George Club.
Tom Sharkey has an idea of leaving this
City on Sunday for New York for the pur
pose of telling Jim Corbett that he was
never cut out for a prize fighter aud could
only whip sick men.
Next Wednesday evening the San Fran
cisco Athletic Club will give an athletic
exhibition at its clubrooms, 431 Sixth
street.
An interesting and varied programme
consisting of boxing, wrestling, etc., has
been arranged. The event of the evening
will be a four-round "go" between Charles
Dixon and Jack King. Both men have a
number of victories to their credit. They
are very scientific and are hard hitters.
They will enter the ring at 125 pounds.
An exciting bout is looked for.

Teams Preparing to Compete for
Football Honors.
PORTLAND, OK., Oct. 16.â The free match
game between the Multnomah Club and the
High School to-morrow arternoon will inau
gurate the winter season for football in Port
land. A week from to-morrow the boys of
Battery A will play the Multnomahs. A good
deal of interest centers in to-morrow's game on
boih aides. It is claimed that the school
eleven has had better opportunities for prac
tice and they expect to mace the Multnomahs
work hard for victory. Both teams were at
work on the field yesterday and showed up
well in practice. William B. Goodwin, who is
referred to as the father of the gridiron game
on the Sound, afforded both teams the benefit
of some good coaching advice as he watched
them at preliminary practice yesterday after
noon.
Vlsalla Sportlnir News.
Visama, Cal., Oct. 14, 1896.
Editor Call: According to reliable reports re
ceived here, large game is plentiful in the
mountains. Only a short distance from the
Mineral King store several fine bears have
been killed. Reports from Portervllle state
that bears and other large game are coming
out in the opening somewhat earlier this sea
son than usual. As Porterville has some very
good shots, we may expect to hear of favorable
results. Several parties will go out Sunday,
and it is to be hoped that ail promises that
have been made during the past week will be
paid. There is no reason why they should not
be, for quail are plentiful even here in the
valley.
Sunday sports of late have been devoted
mostly to baseball between local nines, con
sisting of professional and business men. Last
Sunday the business men of Main street created
a lot of f iyi for their patrons and friends. The
upper or east-endera won by a score of 11 to 6.
Now comes the "Darktown" club with a chal
lenge to any local club, bar none.
The regular team intended to play Bakers
field on the 18th, but owing to the inability of
the pitcher in going with them the game has
been declared off.
The high school eleven are hard at it, and
daily after school hours they can be seen at
work. They realize that to defeat Selma it
will take many weeks' practice. Cabeoll.
Lund Beg Ins Another Salt.
John Simpson, the Danish Consul, is having
no end of trouble with E. T. J. Lund over a
matter of $360. The latter yesterday filed In
the United States District Court a suit for the
amount named against the Consul, the action
being based on an old claim which Lund holds
against his sister's estate. It appears that
some thirty year* ago Miss Lund died in
Sweden, leaving an estate valued at $40,000
and also an unpaid board bill to her brother
for 1440 kroners, or $360. This claim was
some time ago placed in the hands of Mr.
Simpson for collection, but that gentleman
could do nothing in the premises,.because the
claim had been outlawed. Lund, however,
contended that if the Consul had filed certain
papers as instructed he would have experi
enced no trouble in collecting the amount
alleged to De due. Because of Simpson's fail
ure to do this suit was beeun against him for
the $360. Last week the action was dismissed
with prejudice, it being understood that a
compromise had been effected. It seems now
that these negotiations were not fruitful of
good results, for a second suit, as already told,
was instituted yesterday.
TO RULE MASONS
FOR NEXT YEAR
W. T. Lucas of Santa Maria
Elected to the Grand
Master's Chair.
Other Grand Officers Advanced

Rank.
C. I. PATTON JUNIOR WARDEN.
Installation Will Take Place This
Afternoon, When the Lodge
Will Close.
The afternoon session of the Most Wor
shipful Grand Lodge of Master Masons
yesterday was occupied in the election of
grand officers for the ensuing Masonic
year.
For the high office of Most Worshipful
Grand Master there was no opposition to
William T. Lucas of Santa Maria. He
having filled the office of deputy grand
master during tbe past hear his elevation
The Most Worshipful Grand Master, W* T. Lucas, arid the Officers
"Who Will Govern the Grand Lodge of Masons for the
State of California for the Ensuing Masonic Year.
to the Oriental chair was a foregone con
clusion. To succeed him in the deputy
grand master's position Hon. Thomas
Flint Jr. of San Juan was advanced from
the senior grand warden's station to a seat
in the East.
Judge Frank M. Angellotti of San
Rafael was advanced from the South to
the West, taking the station made vacant
by the promotion of Thomas Flint Jr.
The contest for the position of junior
grand warden was the only one that
brought out the voting strength of the
members, and in this Charles L. Patton,
an attorncy-at-law in San Francisco, who
holds the position of president of tbe
board of trustees of the Widows' and Or
phans' Home, the cornerstone of which
was laid on last Wednesday, was elected
by a handsome majority.
George Johnson, the popular grand sec
retary, and Edward Coleman, treasurer,
were re-elected by acclamation.
The question that at one time seemed to
bring about a good deal of discussion was
the management of tbe Masonic cemetery,
but the Grand Lodge settled that matter
in quick order by simply saying it was not
a matter that came within its jurisdiction,
and any irregularity that may be in its
management must be settled by the San
Francisco lodges within whose jurisdic
tion is the cemetery question. Although it
is not charged that any serious trouble ex
ists in the management of the cemetery,
some of the shareholders had an impres
sion that it could be more economically
conducted.
The installation of the new officers will
be held this afternoon, after which the
lodge will close.
ARMORY CLUB BOXING,
Sbannon and Lewis Fought a
Draw and Anthony Whipped
Carkeek.
Herget, Owing to His Poor Condition,
Was Defeated by Agnew in
the Fifth Round.
The Armory Club had a tolerably good
attendance at a boxing exhibition given
under its auspices last evening in Wood
ward's pavilion.
The first event of the evening was an
eight-round contest between Billy Lewis
of Sacramento and Billy Shannon of San
Francisco. Tom Sharkey was selected to
reteree the contest. Billy Jordan intro
duced him as the coming champion, but
Tom thinks that he has earned the title of
champion because of Corbett's refusal to
fight him.
It was 9:15 o'clock when the gong
sounded for the first round. Lewis was
first to lead a right on Shannon's ribs.
Shannon got home several good, stiff left
hand punches, and toward the end of the
round he brought Lewis to his knees by a
right-band swine on the jaw.
Shannon was first to land in the second
round, after which give-and-take punches
followed. Lewis now fought a bit foul,
but Shannon did not protest. Neither
man seemed to have gained any advan
tage at the end. Lewis went to his corner
with a bleeding nose.
In the third round LewiÂ« led with hia
left and attempted to push Shannon over
the ropes. Shannon landed several lefts,
but Lewis was dangerous, as he swing his
right several times close to Shannon's jaw.
In the fourth Shannon tot a bloody
nose, but he landed the most blows.
Lewis was swinging his right in a wild
manner.
The fifth was baa for Lewis. In the first
rally he got a bad cut in the left ear,
which roused his temper and he smashed
wildly at Shannon. This was Shannon's
round.
Although Lewis received the most pun
ishment in the sixth round, he gave onan
non some wicked uppercnts, which weak
ened the receiver. Near the end of the
round he cut a deep gash over Shannon's
right eye, which bled freely.
At the end of tiie seventh round Lewis'
face was painted a bright red from the
blood which streamed from his nose.
Shannon scored a good lead in thi3 round,
but Lewis fought game, however.
In the eight and last round Lewis fought
like a demon, and Shannon was very tired
when the gong sounded the end of the
contest.
Sharkey declared the contest a draw.
It was understood that Jimmy Anthony
of Australia was to fight two men, but
Cooney failed to meet his aereement and
instead of weighing in at 115 pounds he
scaled 123 pounds. His second opponent,
Billy Carkeek, scaled 113^ pounds and
was accepted. The contest between Oar
keek and Anthony was ten rounds. Car
keek fought very gamely, but he was out
classed from the start, and in the third
round he led for Anthony's face and re
ceived a short right stab in the stomach
which put him to sleep in his own cor
ner*
The event of the evening came at 10:50
o'clock. It was a ten-round contest be
tween Gus Herget and Lon Agnew. The
contestants wrangled over a referee for
half an hour, when they finally selected
Tom Sharkey, who came up Â»o the scratch
smiling. He said: "If these two men are
on their feet at the end of ten rounds they
agree to make the match a draw."
The first round was uninteresting. Only
light blows were landed.
In the second round the fighters warmed
up, and Herget took quite a lead. He
punched Agnew some good rights and
lefts on the face, and avoided Aenew's
right swings by clever ducking. He was
the weaker man. though, at the call of
time.
In the third round Agnew kept Herget
going, and at the end Gus was as weak as
a cat. Condition told on him.
In the fourth round Agnew had Herget
in a bad way and just before the gong
sounded Herget was knocked down by a
punch in the stomach. He took his nine
seconds and then stepped feebly to his
corner.
Herget was saved by the timely sound
of the gong in the fifth round. He made
a game stand and punched Agnew several
times in the nose, but being out of condi-
tion Agnew dropped him as tbe round
closed. Herget's seconds then threw up
the sponge.
THE GREENWOOD ESTATE
Froperty of the Pioneer Valued
at One Hundred Thou
sand Dollars.
Nearly All of It Bequeathed to the
Three Sons and Daughter
of Deceased.
Monroe Greenwood's will was yesterday
filed for probate. He left an estate of over
$fOO,OOO, most of which was bequeathed to
his three sons and his daughter.
The document was written entirely by
the pioneer merchant, and recites that the
man who has been blessed by an abund
ance of earthly wealth owes it to the bal
ance of humanity to disburse a portion in
charity. He therefore establishes a trust
fund of $20,000, of which his four children
are named as trustees, and provides that
it be invested in telephone stock and the
proceeds distributed among the charities
of the Presbyterian church until the
bonds become due. Then the principal is
to be disDosed of as the trustees see fit.
It is set forth that all the property the tes
tator possessed was community property,
and therefore no provision is made for
Mrs. Greenwood, except that the furniture
is eiven to her.
One thousand dollars each is willed to
each of testator's grandchildren, and an
identical sura to his niece. May Green
wood. To Ada Sherling $500 is left
The balance of the estate is bequeathed
share and share alike to Frank M., Jennie
8., George L>. and Fred A. Greenwood.
The three sons are named as executors
without bonds.

THE WORK AMONG STUDENTS.
C. C Michener, International College
Agent, Explains the Department
Which He Represents.
The sixteenth annual State convention
of the Young Men's Christian Association,
which commenced its regular session yes
terday morning, is proving one of the
most interesting meetings of tbe kind yet
held.
The convention got to work early, and
Â»ofganizat!on was effected as follows:
President, Mi S. Woodhams of San Fran
cisco; vice-presiiients, D. Edward Collins
of Oakland. Frank Babb oF San Jose, C. M.
Campbell of Sacramento; secretaries, Roy
M. Day of Los Angeles aud Fenham A.
Bop. ham oi Reno, Nev.
The following committees were ap
pointed: Business â J. G. Daub of San
Francisco; Howard Mclntyre, Sacra-
mento; R. Lee Sineey, Woodland. De
votional â Grove T. Ekin, Sacramento; F.
A. Jackson, San FraDCisco; I. C. Crook,
Baa Francisco. Press â Moar Hestiih,
Woodland; F. A. Jackson, JSan Francisco.
Besolutions â Rudolph Homer, San Fran
cisco; J. J. Pfister, San Francisco. State
committee reportâ Noel H., JacKs, Oak
land; Frank Heath. Santa Cruz; C. A.
Maydweil, San Francisco.
Papers were read Dy Grove T. Ekin on
"The Association Membership Privileges
and Their Limitation" and r>y Noel H.
Jacks upon "Xde Financial Relationship
and Extension." Both papers elicited
interesting and profitable discussion.
In the afternoon A. G. Brock, physical
director of the Oakland Association, read
a paper on "Association Gymnasium and
Athleticsâ to What Extent Should We
Encourage Prizes and Rewards?" The
argnment involved was that the great
majority of amateur athletes are not seek
ing to deveiop the body primarily bnt the
attainment of personal glory. This, it
was claimed, is greatly increased by the
unwise distribution of valuable prizes, un
til the athle'.e becomes a mere medal*
hunter. The substantial inducements
offered by clubs, the speaker said, too fre
quently lured young men from the asso
ciation. Especially was this the case with
those who had attained such proficiency
in certain lines as to Tattract attention.
Mr. Brock stated that this was one of the
most perplexing problem^ which had faced
the physical director, and he suggested as
a partial remedy that the development of
the body for the sake of health, not
strength, be kept primarily before the
gymnasium stndents.
RÂ«v. C. G. Baldwin, president of Po
mona College of Mono County, spoke on
the necessity of havincr Christian young
men as directors of the Y. M. C. A.
gymnasiums. He declared that the gym
nasium work is the grandest work ttiere
is. "I have studied this work for years,"
*âº he said. "If we are to get the manly,
strong-men we will meet them there. Tht
directors will meet youne men that gen
eral secretaries will never hare a chance
to meet"
Noel H. Jacks also spoke of the im
portance and the opportunities of the
f;ymnasium work.
Mr. Daub, C. C. Michener, H. L. Dietz,
G. F. Ekin and others also spoke of the
advantages of a skillful and thoroughly
Christian physical director.
Dr. Thompson of the American BiDle
Society made a brief address in bahalf of
the work of the organization which he
represented.
D. Edward Collirjs of Oakland, chairman
of the State Committee, stated that the
hard times had affected all the associa
tions, but everything looked forward to
better times.
John L. tjpsar of San Francisco, secre
tary of t c State Committee, read his re
port. It showed that the debts of various
associations had been materially reduced.
Only one association has closed* its doors,
that at Ventura, but it has not abandoned
its organization. New associations have
been formed at Monterey, lleno (Nev.),
Santa Baroara and Eureka.
"The work over the State to-day," said
Mr. Spear, "has been more successfully
prosecuted than I have ever known it be
fore. There has been a very marked ad
vance in the association work on account
of the faithfulness of the men engaged in
the work."
A general discussion of how to more
effectually prosecute State work concluded
the afternoon's session.
In the evening the exercises were con
ducted by the College Association repre
sentatives, under the leadership of C. C.
Â»>lichpner, the international college aeent.
Mr- Michener introduced the subject ot
the evening. "Tho popular idea of the
college men," snid he, "is erroneous,
uhere is an idea that college men are in
terested in athletics, social life or some,
thing above everything else, which is not
Christian. The fallacy of this impression
is shown by the fact that there are more
men in the College Young Men's Chris
tian Association than in any other inter
collegiate organization." Tne speaker
dwelt upon the necessity of reaching the
young men who are destined to become
leaders in the various phases of life which
they will enter.
John C. Spear, State secretary, read the
report of Gale M. Fisher, president of the
Caliiornia College Associations. It showed
thirteen college associations in tho State,
all of which were prosperous and promis
ing. It was announced that Mr. Fisbei
had been called to tlie general secretary
ship of the student movement in Boston,
a remunerative office of nigh importance.
F. R. Fairchild. president of the associ
ation of the State University, was called
upon to Bpeak of the work among new
students. He gave an account of the
methods which his society had taken to
attract freshmen and staled that the asso
ciation at Berkeley haci this year twice the
number of members it had last year.
Roy W. Day, president of the Occidental
Cohege Association and representative of
the college associations of Southern Cali
fornia, spoke of missionary work among
college societies.
W. W. Bristol of the University of Cali
fornia described the work done at Caza
dero and tbe effect which the services had
upon the young men.
W. P. Giflord. president of the associa
tion at Stanford and chairman of the
student work committee of Northern Cali
fornia, spoke of tbe influence of the Caza
dero conference on his institution. Mr.
Gifford told of the manner in which the
university had raised $500 last year to sup
port missionary work in India.
F. A. Barham of the recently organized
association in the State University of Ne
vada told of the conditions prevalent in
that institution and the hopes which he
and his fellows entertained for the moral
and spiritual advancement of their col
lege.
In conclusion Mr. Michener made brief
remarks upon college work. The conven
tion will meet at 9 cPc'ock this morning.

IT IS GAME AND GRAPES NOW.
All who desire to be abreast of the times
must now eat game, for the season is on.
That is, it is on for the sportsman, but not
the inarketman.
H'lho State law gives
â hunters the privilege
IÂ°' killing quail and
Bwild duck after Octo-
Hber 15, but the ' City
Mordinance forbids the
Kale of these birds
Mbefore November 15.
HSo, if you want game
Byou must either kill it
â yourself or drop a hint
Hto some male friend
Hwho belongs to a game
Hclub to remember you.
Mime, there is a blood
: whisper pa
ing about that most of the marketmen
have been secretly selling quail and duck
for a month past, and that all the
first-class restaurants keep them to your
order, out as no on^^^^^^^H
in San Francisco, es-H
pecially the marketH
man and the restauH
rateur, could be hirecM
to break an ordinanc<M
passed by the BoarcM
of Supervisors, tbi^H
whisper is doubtles;M
a base libel. 80 yoiM
can't get game unleatM
you kill it yourself, 01H
'some friend gives lfl
to you. '
The quail anil thcH
duck are at their besH
now. They are falH
and tender, which ifl
more than they wilH
be later on. Eat theruH
now while they arcH
in style. By and byBBBBIHBHH
they will be common and everybody will
have them. Then you won't want them.
A lost opportunity is never regained.
A shadow is looming up over the hori
zon. It is the thanksgiving turkey. He
will be due here in somewhat over a month.
â H|^^HTlie pre-Thanksgiv
ling turkey is already
I getting scarce in an-
I tics pa ion of t his

I not buy him for 10
I cents a pound, as you
I coula a fortnight ago.
I Twenty cents comes
I nearer the quotation
â  now. This is rather
â  expensive eating for
â  common everyday
â  folks.
Grapes continue
the piece de resis
tance of the fruit market. The plums and
peaches are almost gone and it gives one
the cold shivers to even think of water,
melons these cool ; autumn days, so
grapes head the list at present. They
are I cool enough, gracious knows, for the

and all that sort ofH

THE HICKS CASE
STILL A MYSTERY
Police Are as Yet Unable
to Find Any New
Theories.
Captain Lees Issues Orders That
the Dead Man's Wife
See the Corpse.
PROBABLY SHOT AT HIS DESK.
The Defense Gives Out a Statement
That the Shot Was in Self.
Defense.
The efforts of the police in the case of
the killing of E. T. Hicks by Joseph A.
Mitchell have not thrown very much lieht
on the motive of the shooting. Captain
Lees said, late last night: "The only
human being we know of who has the
real story is the man who did the shoot
ing, and he refuses to speak. I cannot
understand why the newspapers should
defend the defendant when he positively
refuses to defend himself."
Captain Lees was not altogether correct,
however, for the defense has been put
forth at some length by Attorney P. B.
Nagle, who represents the defendant. At
torney Nagle yesterday gave forth the
following for publication concerning the
case:
We will bave two affirmative defenses when
tbe case comes to trial. In the first place, we
will be able to satisfy a jury that Mitcbell
killed Hicks in self-defense. As to our other
defense, we are nut prepared to make a state
ment at this. time. The facts in the case are
these. Wednesday afternoon a woman client
called to nee Mitchell, who chanced to be out
of tbe office. Hicks took occasion to tell the
client that Mitchell was a fraud.
The woman went away, and, meeting Mitch
ell on the street, told him what Hicks bad
said. This is ail there is in the story of a
woman in the case. Yesterday morning Mitch
ell objected to Hicks' interference in his busi
ness and Hicks jumped him, giving him a ter
rific beating with a uair of brass knuckles.
I think Hicks would have killed Mitchell at
that time had not a tenant on the same floor
come to the rescue. I cannot give the name
of the tenant at this time.
Mitchell tbeu went away and got the pistol
to protect himseli. When be came back in the
afternoon Hicks leaped to his feet and started
in to repeat tbe beating of the morning. It
was then that Mitchell, seeing that escape was
impossible, drew bis pistal and killed Hicks.
The case has been almost exclusively
in the charge of Detective Harry B. Reyn
olds, who made several reports on the
evidence last night. The most important
feature is that which shows almost con
clusively that the dead man waa shot
while sitting at his desk, the range of the*
bullet being downward through the dead
man's necktie, the bullet coming out of
tbe back.
Another interesting development in the
case was that the dead man's wife lives at
39 Locust avenue and that she was forc
ibly thrown out of the undertaking
rooms where her husband's body
lay oy William Morendez Gregory,
brother -in - law of deceased, yester
day and the day before. Captain
Lees gave positive orders to Detective
Reynolds last night that Mrs. Hicks be
allowed to see her husband to-day.
"I heard Hicks say this woman was his
wife," eaid Captain Lees, "and I know
nothing about tbe claims that there is an
other wife at 220 Eddy street."
Mrs. Hicks said last night: "I do not
want Gregory to get access to my hus
band's trunk. It would not be right. Mrs.
Gregory is bis sister, but they did not
speak, and he forbade me to associate
with her."
An interesting sidelight of the tragedy
comes from Thomas Sands, ni^-bt watch
man of the building where the tragedy oc
curred. Speaking of it to Detective Rey
nolds, he said :
"Hicks told me Mitchell would have to
get out of his office, as it was hard to get
rent out of him. A few days before the
killing Hicks caught Mitchell in his office
and told me to watch Mitchell and not let
him ho into his office with the woman."
The report does not say what woman,
nor does it throw further light on the
killing.
The most important report of the day
was thatof Reynolds, which ran as follows:
"I found on the left lapel of the vest a
hole where the bullet went through his
neckÂ»carf, a white four-in-hand, the hole
being in the lower left corner; also I
found powder marks on it, also on his
shirt I found a bullet hole and powder
marks."
A. W. Scott of room 514 in the same
building made a statement that be heard
tbe shots and screams, saw Mitchell com
ing downstairs and afterward heard him
say, "I did a ââ.good job of it in self
defense."
The statement of A. S. Grant of 3281
Twenty-fourth street is important, because
hÂ« heard the fight and heard Hicks say:
â¢'You have got me by the throat."
Another interesting bit of evidence is
that of Dr. G. L. Fitch who beard the
shots and screams, then the breaking glass.
He showed that tbe patient lived several
minutes after tbe shot struck him, and
that there was not from the first the slight -
est chance for restoring life.
Mrs. X tan ton of 220 Eddy street states
that she was never engaged to the late
Eaward J. Hicks. She accounts for bis
possessing her rinc by tbe fact that it was
too large for her. linger and that he offered
to have it made smaller. She therefore
gave it into bis keeping, where it was
found at the time of bis death. She does
not claim any money from him.
The fun ral of E. J. Hicks will take
place Sunday, at 1:30 P. M.. from Memorial
Hall, Odd Fellow-' building, he having
been a member of the Rebekans. Mrs.
Stan ton wa-< a past noble grand of Chrys
anthemum Lodge of the Rebekahs.

CHARTER WILL BE FIRST.
Registrar Hinton Will Place It at the
- Head of the Official Ballot.
The question of placing the space for tbe
Tote on the charter ar the top or bottom
of the ballot at the coming election was
left to the discretion of the Registrar at
yesterday's meeting of tbe Election CornÂ»
missioners. Registrar Hinton called the
attention of the hoard to th' fact that the
first candidates on the ticket, as shown by
tbe last election, received on an average
about twice as many votes as those wUo
were at the bottom of the ballot.
He claimed that the charter was too im
portant a matter to be allowed to pass in
this manner.
The Commissioners agreed with him,
and left it in his hands, and, as Mr. Himoii
is in favor of the charter, it will probably
head the ticket.
The following election officers were ap
pointed oy the Commissioners yesterday :

Another Holladay Title^Suit.
S. W. Holladay yesterday brought suit against
the City and County of San Francisco to quiet
title to the property bounded by Washington,
Octaviaand Gough streets and extending
northward half way to Clay street, and Known
as Lafayette Park.
The dispute as to the title to this property
has been in the courts a number of tirties and
has been litigated before the Supreme Court of
the United State, s of California and different
State and county courts.
Suffered From Clioofl.
THE \UB OF MISERY WAS WAVZD
OVER THE DEAD OF MRS. ROSE
PARGETER AT Aff EARLY AGE.
From the Statesman, Salem, Or.
No victory in life bears so potent and so
grateful a sense as the achievement over dis
ease, the complete restoration to normal, phys
ical Â«nd nerve conditions.
A case In point developed in Salem, Or.,
lately, and the particulars of the story as re
ported to the Statesman were of a character to
warrant an Investigation as a matter of news.
The beneficiary in this matter proved to bo
Mrs. R^se Pargeter. the wife of the proprietor
of big Boise dairy nlant, and a lady of marked
Intel l ijrence, one who would be conscientiously
reluctant to make anything approaching an
exaggerated stÃtement.
Mrs. Pargeter said to the reporter that her
childhood, girlhood and early womanhood had
been made unhappy by her susceptibility to
nervous disorders which found expression in
almost constant sick headaches, neuralgia
and kindred evils that all but wrecked an
otherwise hnppy and useful life.
Her parents, well-to-do and inspired by af
fectionate anxiety for their daughter's future,
employed the best physicians, but invariably
without : success. Almost every known medi
cine that seemed applicable to their dnueh
ter's case was tried in cease ese succession, but
the trouble seemed irreradicableand Irrepress
ible, and even after her marriage to Mr. Parge
ter the same indomitable search for relief was
kept up and still the afflictions would not
abate, until at last Mrs. Parceter's health was
deemed irretrievably lost, and the future held
but little charm for the youne people.
Mrs. Pareeter finally became so exhausted
by repeated and enervating attacks of nerv
ousness, by the dendly intermMtteuce of sick
headache and the frequent agonies of neural
gia that it was almost impossible for her to get
about at all.
The story of how she came to take Pink Pills
is a lonK one and need not be told here. Suf
fice to say i>he did begin them and with the
following result:
The first box did not bring the coveted re
lief, but Mrs. Pargeter is a just woman and a
thorough one. She did not disparage- the rem
edy because of the failure at the first point
The second box was taken with careful ad
herence to printed Instructions, and 10l the
dawn of her deliverance burst upon her. She
proceeded with the treatment until the ninth
box had been disposed of, and to-day Mrs
Rose Pargeter is the active manager of one of
the largest dairies in this couniy and the
head of one of the happiest homes in the
world, and proud of the vicory accomplished
with this splendid remedy. 6he will not suffer
the possible interposition of any other agency
than the Pink Pills, ascribing the triumph to
them alone, and her gratitude for their extra
ordinary success is only equaled by tiiat suc
cess itself.

TRADE GETTING trVEI/T.
Trade !s livelier than for four years. A glance
down the market report will show almost every
staple stiff, active and advancing. ThÂ°re is a reg
ular boom in Wheat and other cereals and in
Raisins. Klour coos up 25 cents a barrel every
day or two. Dried Frnlt Is rising steadily linger a
first rate demand. Provisions, too, are selMu*
we I. The air Is full of returned prosperity, and it
looks as if the hard times of the past three years
were really over at last.
Explanation.
The arrow flies with tbe wind. The top figures '
at sjation indicate maximum temperature for the j
days; those underneath it. if any. the amount of â¢
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and bundredtbs, |
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect poln s of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
wonl â¢â hieh" means high barometric pressure and
is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
nfers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
anil accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" us ally first appear on the Washington
coasl. When the pressure is high in the Interior
nnd low along the coas:, and the Isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "lnw" Is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coa.'. warmer j
weather may be expected ;n summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result.

DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK. N. V., Oct. 16â R. G. Dun * Co.
wli: say to-morrow in their weekly review of trade:
Gold command, a small premium. The most
p nvoriul force ln business at present is a conserva
tive timiillt-, and the foreign cankers, who have
been offering for a small percentage to insure peo
ple against a premium on gold until December,
have made an easy and sure profit out of
prevalen apprehensions. From Kansas, Ne
braska and other States where the silver agita
tion is said to hi? strong it was ordered by many
bankers and business men to get them gold at a
sma 1 premium and there has been a small de
mand for boarding from individuals in other
States who are afraid even of their own best judg
ment.
One commercial change which more than
any other insures belter busint-ss in tbe near fu
ture is the excess of merchandise exports over Im
portn. In two weeks f October the sxp>r;s from
New York have Increased 30.6 per cent against
31.2 In eptember, whi c impor-s havedecre sed
24 per cent, against 34. 2 in September, contin
ued shii men'is of gold from Europe, not including
94.0-Â»0, iOO trom Aus'raia, now amount to
9i>f\250,000 since the" movement began, of wblch
9&i ,250,000 has already arrived and have rot
bern arrÂ»%ted by measures taken by the great tu
roi can banks.
'1 Lie h- avy movement of grain is the corner
stone. After an increase of S5 9-5,625 ln exports
of oreaus nflfe In .-epternber there have been
snipped the last week from Atlantic ports alone
2,134,774 bushels, fl .or included, and 4,203.845 in
two weeks of octob r. against 3.610,271 last year.
A more important fa- 1 is that all available grain
frelgti s havÂ«j been encased for montns ahead
here and on tbe Pacific Coast. The Minister of
Agricul ure in India sta ed In council on Thurs
day that distress was ex nee ed in a large part of
India as tbe result of droughts.
A hign official of Rus-ia now in this conntry
confirms accounts of shortness in the Rus-Un
yield, liius es.imatei that turope will fal 100,-
OjO.ooo bushels short of list year In supply ot
wheaii are strongly supported, and while d part
men: estimate* of the 1 ield in this country are not
credited, there is every reason to expect a'remark
able toreign demand. Wheat has advanced 4V^c
for the week;. Boot and shoe makers got very
narrow orders at tbe old prices, or at an advance
of less 1 h nn 1 percent.
Difficulties threaten the iron manufacture, for
pig Is hi her, Bessemer at 911 60 and gray forge
at 5 9 75 Ht I'ittsbur , Â»hi c pla es and beams ure
weaker, and various coojbinat.ons hold prices only
by leaving outs de comp utors to ta^e the market
as lar as they can. bteel bars are .argely sold at

that outsders can produ>e are so. d at less than
the association asks; bi leis ar- sttll sold for less
than the pool prices, aod its s liptnents in SÂ») tem
ber agitre^ated oniy 36.000 tons, mainly on sheet
and tinplnte bar*, and the demand for rails is
growing small.
Wool is stronger wlh continued speculative
buying, aod sa cs at Eastern markets have been
14,55^,300 pounds for two w eks against 21,209.
-700 last y ar and 16 702.80U in 1892, but con
signed wool has been withdrawn until after the
election. No gain is a: present possible in goods,
ana though th- number of mills s>arti:ig for the
week is fifteen against seven s'opplng much of the
work done is tn anticipation of a better demand
than now exials. Tbe cot.on manufacture has

NEW YORK, N. . V., Oct. 16.â Business at the
Stock ' Exchange was extremely licht, the | sales
amounting to only 105,000 shares, of which '.'8, 70')
were sugar. At the opening the tendency was
downward, suear falling a poln to lOHI4 on the
reported combination of outside refineries. A de
nial of the story ltd to a recovery to 107%. but
near the close the price drooped back to 107. The
early weakness in the general list soon gave way to
strength, but the advance failed to stimulate
trading. The most ' favorable development <>f ' the
day as the engagement of over $3,000.1/00 told
in London for shipment to New. York. â¢ '1 lie ar

CHICAGO. MARKETS. ,
CHICAGO, 111. .Oct. 16â Wheat attained the
highest point on the present bulge to day, Decem
ber selling at 7 2 Vie. 'Most of the advance was an
overnight one. prices at the opening being from
Ito IVic higher than at the close yesterday. The
motive for this gain was the Liverpool advices,
from Id 10 2d advance.' The 'crowd was inclined
to favor the bull side, and the foreign news af
forded the required excuse for aggressive buying.
Gold imports by New York bankers were also
viewed as of an encouraging na.ure. One of the
leading Kelps to improvement is ' the constant
playing for a break, which is indulged in by nu
merous operators, and who, achieving no success
are compel ed .0 cover at a decided disadvantage.

FOOTBALL TEAMS
Berkeley Has Sixty-Two
Players on the Suit
List.
Fourteen More Candidates Than
Came Out at Any Time
Last Year.
A 275-FOTJND CENTER-BUSH,
The Team Taken as a Whole Is Much
Lighter This Year Than
Last.
BERKELEY, Cal., Oct. 16.â Sixty-two
Berkeley football menâ almost six com
plete teamsâ have taken out playing suits
this season, thus signifying their inten
tion of trying for the Varsity eleven.
Over fifty of these men come out daily for
practice. This remarkable showing far
exceeds anything of the kind in all the
history of football at the University of
California. Last year forty-eight suits in
<â  sll were given out by the management.
Three years ago only half as many men
came out as are on the Berkeley gridiron
every afternoon this season.
Most notable among the previously un
initiated is A. J. Molera '99, who is prob
ably the heaviest candidate for football
honors that ever stepped on a Pacific
Coast gridiron, weighing 275 pounds
etripped. Last evening he did his first
work, having lined up as center on the
second eleven.
He is strong about the arms and shoul
ders, bÂ«ing able to "chin himself" twelve
times successively on the Horizontal bar.
Though somewhat weak in the ankles he
Hopper '98 (End), Berkeley's
Smallest Football Player.
is able to aprir.tin better style than most
men of his weight and build. He says he
intends training rigtit along through the
season,
Tne next lighter man on the team is
Birdsall, another candidate for center, who
weighs 207 pounds, a difference of sixty
eignt pounds.
The lightest player of the entire sixty
two is Jimmie Hopper '98, who tips the
beam at 137%, just half the* weight of
Molera, the big cemer.
The other sixty candidates range all the
way from 140 to 200 pounds, most of wnom
weigh about 165. Taking tne players as a
whole they are about ten pounds lighter
than those of last year, though Butter
worth says that what they lack in weight
he proposes to have them make up in grit
and endurance.
Butterworth gave the boys a lecture^the
other day in the gymnasium, in which he
said that they had too much ceremony
about their playing; that they were afraid !
of ineult'ng one another by not apolo
gizing for a hard knock administered, and
that if they continued such tactics a
â¢ "scrub" team from any of the Eastern
colleges could come out here and "do thorn
up" easily.
i Since his lecture to them they have been
~A putting more snap into their plays, and
A -ye thus been aole to make longer ad
vances with the ball and to offer better in
terference. A great deal of attention is
being paid to the training of the center
and guards, as these places, as well as the
tackles, one end and a halfback, will have
to be filled with new men. Stanford has
both guards and the center of last year back
again. Cornish, one of the most promis
ing candidates for tackle up to a few days
ago, cannot play any more this season be
cause of objections made on the part
of his family.
Selfridge, last year's center, w also laid
off permanently for the same reason. Mc-
Dermott and Birdsall ere the only two re
maining candidates besides Molera for
center. Ludlow and Greisberg have both
been playing as guard on the first eleven
during the week. Simpson and Castle
hun are still first choice for tackles,
Hutchinson is holding down one end,
â  while McNutt, Hopper and Craig are
after the other. Back of the line on the
Varsity eleven are Kansome at full, Ken
nedy at quarter and Hall and Snerman at
halves. Butterworth has been centering
much of his attention for the past week
on Hall and Sherman, both of whom seem
to be getting into good form.
Tne Berkeley team will play their sec
ond game of the season to-morrow after
noon at 3 o'clock with the Reliance Club
team at Contral Park. Following will be
the lineup: Center, Birdsall; guards,
Ludlow and Greisberg; tackles. Simpson
and Castlehun; ends, Hutcbinson and
McNutt; quarter, Kennedy; halves, Hall
and Sherman; full, Captain Ransome.

Met. After Many Tears.
BERKELEY, Cal., Oct. 16.â Frank and
William Cooper, two brothers who had
not seen each other for seventeen years,
met in Berkeley yesterday. They lost
track of each other in Montana in the lat
ter seventies and have been estranged
ever since. William had been living in
Sonoma for some time, and hearing, by
mere accident, of his brother's where
abouts came to the university town yes
terday to greet him.

vent have purchased a plat in St. Mary's

SOCIETY SENSATION.
Three Members of the "Skull and
Keys" Society Offer Their
Resignations.
BERKELEY, Cal., Oct. 16.â The society
sensation of the season at the State Univer
sity took place to-nieht, when Fletcher Mc-
Nutt, Lawrence Havens and Dudley Dean,
all of the class of '96, offered their resigna
tions to the '"Skull and Keys" fraternity.
Trouble in the brotherhood has been
brewing for some time over the way its
business affairs should be conducted,
especially with reference to the acquisition
of new members, and the culmination of
the difficulty resulted in a split.
The society numbers about twenty-five
and is made up wholly of the members of
the several Greek-letter Iraternities at the
university. They have long been looked
upon as the swell set ot Berueley, and
their annual dramatic functions are largely
attended by members of the elite from
both sides of the bay. The organization
is a local society and was formed about
five years ago. It is to Berkeley what the
"Skull and Bones" is to Yale and the
"Hasty Pudding" to Harvard.
Only juniors and seniors are eligible to
membership in the exclusive order, and
consequently only two or three members,
at most, are taken from the various Greek
letter orders. The resignation of the
three mentioned members is said to be
only a beginning of the trouble and that
the end to the difficulty in thÂ» brotherhood
is afar off.
CROSS TOWN SYSTEM.
F. M. Smith Slakes a Deal to Secure the
Highland Park Electiic Road.
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. 16â The fore
closure suit of the California Safe De
posit and Trust Company on a $200,000
mortgage against the Highland Park and
Fruitvale Railway Company was up be
fore Judge Ogden to-day and continued
until the 23d inst. on motion of the trust
company's attorney, who stated that it
was expected F. M. Smith would acquire
the road before that date.
Mr. Smith is the heaviest stockholder
in the Oakland Consolidated or Grove
street line to Berkeley and tha lines to
i West Oakland on Sixteenth and Eighth
: streets, and it is Delieved he also controls
i the Twelfth-street line to the west end.
At present the system has no feeder to
East Oakland, but if he secures the High
i land Park road it would give him an out
! let to East Oakland over the Eleventh
| street bridpe with the Alameda electric
i line. The Eighth-street or Vandercook
line is in the hands of a receiver, and it is
said he has been negotiating for it also.
This would give him command of Eighth
and Twelfth streets to Broadway.
Swallowed Liniment.
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct.. 16â Victor W.
| Ferguson died this evening from the ef
j fects of poison that he drank last night.
Ferguson lived at Golden Gate with his
mother and brother, and has been a harm
less lunatic for twenty-one years. List
night he went to bed as usual and this
morning he was very sick. He would not
say wha: was the matter with him, but a
doctor was satisfied he had been poisoned
and treated him accordingly, but with no
good result, and this evening he died. A
bottle of laudanum liniment that bis
mother had been using for rheumatism
was found in his room and one-half of it
had been taken.- There is no doubt that
he insane man had swallowed it
Silver vs. Gold. - -

and Republican ' clubs, Thomas Scott and

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 17, 1896.
WROTE HIS WILL
ON A BILLHEAD
Casslear Hartnett Held Off
for Eighty-Two
Years.
Purposely Avoided Making Any
Reference to His Only
Son and Heir.
MAY BE TWO DOCUMENTS.
The Widow Expected to Find Some
Clauses That Were Not in
the Filed Will.
Oakland Officb San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Oct. 16. f
The will of the oldest member of tho
New York Fire Department, Casslear Hart
nett, who died in this city a week ago, has
been filed for probate. For a man of wealth
it is the most unpretentious document
that has been filed with the County Clerk
ior a long time.
The document is written on one sheet of
paper, which bears Dr. Curtis' letter-head,
and was only made in June of last year,
although Mr. Hartnett was then 82 years
of age. The deceased was opposed to mak
ing his will, and could not be prevailed
upon to make it at an earlier date. He
deeded all his property, real and personal,
to his wife, Mrs. Henrietta Hartnett, and
says that he purposely makes no mention
of his only son, who is with the Contra
Costa Water Company of this city.
There is a possibility that the old fire
man may have made a later will, as his
widow referred yesterday to a will that
contained many references to details that
are not mentioned in the document filed
for probate. The witnesses to the filed
will are Alexander Hoenisch, F. O. Stokes
and David Newberry.
Casslear Harriett's property is all lo
cated iv New York State and provides a
comfortab.e income. He was oue of (he
members of the old Engine Company 15
of Nrw York and made a record for
bravery half a century ago.

SELLING A ROAD.
Huntington Findg No Profit In Running
the Ciuatemnla Central-
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. 16.â There has
recently returned from Central America
A. W. Burrell, president of the California I
Bridge Company, where he has been exe
cuting a number of contracts for his com
pany. He was in Salvador, Guatemala,
and other States, in all of which he saw
many evidences of substantial progress.
There was a "revolution" in Nicaragua j
while he was in Salvador, and rumors of .
disturbances in other countries, but these j
things are highly exaggerated. "The \
wurd revolution," he says, "conveys a !
much different idea to our minds from |
what it g'ves a native ofjCentral America, j
and it is hardly proper to apply it to tne j
disturbances they have down there.
"A revolution is usually only an upris- i
ing by which unpopular administrations j
are expelled from power, and it differs i
from an election here principally by being '
more summary in its methods. It is not j
much more forcible, and commonly there j
is no more powder burned or blood shed, j
These so-called revolutions are sometimes j
precipitated by a fear that some person or j
famiiy intends to perpetuate nimself or !
itself in power in violation of law.
"It may be news that C. P. Huntington
il in process of selling out his railroad j
down there â the Guatemala Central. It
is a short line of seventy-five miles, but
built over heavy grades and leading from
the Pacific Ocean to the city of Guatemala.
Up to this time the road" has paid very
well, but the Government is now finishing
a railroad of about 225 miles from the city
of Guatemala to the eastern or gulf coast.
But tne two railroads together â the Guate
mala Central and the Guatemala North
ern â will constitute an important trans
continental line, one that will have a
greater influence, 1 believe, on the course
of business than the new Teh nan tepee
route in Mexico."

The Dnlcirh*' Case.
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. 16.â Mrs. Kate
Grogan Dulcich is believed to have com
promised her case, as she has abandoned
the efforts to secure a new trial in the case
in which she sued Luigi Dulcich to estab
lish her right as his wife. The couple
have lived together for years, reared a
large family and accumulated much prop
erty, but Dulcich recently declared the
marriage void, as her husband was alive
at the time, although she supposed he was
dead. Tne courts upheld his contention
and much litigation followed regardine
property interests in East Oakland, where
he tried to evict the mother ot his children.
Pay* His Fine.
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. 16.â William C.
Clift, the capitalist who was convicted by
a jury for assaulting Attorney C. F.
Jonns, a cripple, was fined $30 to-day by
Judge Wood in the Police Court, which ho
paid. The trouble arose over statements
by Johns reflecting on Justice Frederick
C. Cliffs manner of conducting business,
which his father took up and resented by
striking Johns in the face when he refused
to discuss the matter.
Angry Contractor.
OAKLAND. Cal., Oct. 16.â John Cava
naugh, a sewer contractor, wanted to whip
City Auditor R. W. Snow this morning,
but Chief Lloyd advised him not to and he
desisted. The trouble was over work done
at the First Congregational Church, for
which the contractor was paid in stock
bearing 8 per cent interest, issued l>y the
company^ but which will not be taken up
for three years. He attempted to dispose
of it at the banks and they would not take
it unless he indorsed it; hence his anger.
Investigating Candidates.
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. 16â Ti:e Ameri
can Protective Association will hold a
county convention in Odd Fellows' Hall
to-morrow evening, when the 219 dele
gates selected by the twenty-six councils
of the order in Alameda County, repre
senting 3000 members, will consider the
nominees of the various parties, as well as
the independent candidates.
No Retraction Filed.
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. 16.â The retrac
tion of the libelous articles published by
Gavin .Dhu High on William J. Dinpee
has not yet been filed in court as promised
by his attorney. A statement was sub
mitted to Judge Wood, but he has not ap
proved it and it is surmised that the state
ment is not satisfactory to the court, that
the retraction is not sufficiently explicit.
MAY FINNEY IN TROUBLE.
Runs Away From Home With a Man,,
Who Deserts Her.
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. 16.â Mr. aad Mrs.
T. Gibbons and C. M. Butts of Healdsburg
are in the city endeavoring to secure the
return of Miss May Finney to her home
and parents in Healdsburg. May is only
17 years of age, and up to four weeks ago
was considered an innocent, rosy-cneeked
country lass, who was a great favorite
among a host of friends. Then she took
it into her head to run away from home
and be married. It is said that she left
home with Charlie Gibbons and came to
Sau Francisco, where she says they were
married, but she has no certificate of the
event.
The following day the groom disap
peared, and is now se.id to be in St. Louis.
She was found two weeus later, hungry
and penniless, but refused to go home.
She knew "Charlie" would return for her.
Mrs. Gibbons was seen to-day, and said in
regard to her half-sister:
"I am nearly worried to death by the
girl's action-. I have fed, clotftea and
housed her, but sue does not show the
least gratitude. She accompanied two
other girls to a notorious resort on Sixth
street. She says- she went innocently, but
her actions have been very indiscreet
since. We are willing to help the airl get
a position or take her back to Healdsburg,
or do anything else that would save her
from ruin."
FOUND A QUEUE.
It Had Been Cat From Its Owner's
Head by a Thoughtless Hunter.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Oct. 16.â A long,
black object, curled up with every appear
ance of a snake, frightened Manuel, the
carcleaner at the narrow-gauge mole,
nearly out of bis wits this morning. While
sweeping out a car attached to last night's
Santa Cruz train he suddenly ran upon
the thing under a car seat. After he re
covered from nis first surprise he cau
tiously approached the supposed snake
and dealt it a stinging blow with his
broomhandle on the part he supposed to
be the head. As it did not move he rolled
it over and was surprised to find a China
mnn's queue.
Tae queue had the appearance of having
been cut off close to the owner's head. It
is thought to have been the work of some
bunters who came in on that train.
ALMOST A PARRICIDE.
Thomas Connelly Fires Three
Shots at His Father in
the Mission.
Upon Interfering, Officer M. J Henph
ley Set Upon by Father, Mother
and Son.
Young; Thomas Connelly, aged 19, nar-
I rowly escaped being a parricide when he
| tired three shots at his father, Tnomas
Connelly Sr., at their home on the corner
of Twenty-fourth and Sanchez streets
yesterday about 1:30 p. H.
Officer M. J. Heaphley ran up the steps
to the hous?.
As he was climbing the stairway he
heard two shots and accelerated his speed.
Once in the house he perceived youn.tr
Connelly standing witn a smoking revol
ver in his hand. His father was huddled
up in bed, holding the blanket between
himself and son.
Just as Heaphley entered the room the
old man exclaimed: 'â¢Tom, don't shoot
again !"
Ripping out a yile epithet the boy ex
claimed: "Didn't you feel that last bul
let? I'll give you one that you will feel."
At this juncture the officer grabbed the
revolver and the boy at the same time and
a herce struggle began, when Connelly's
wife, who was standing to one side sob
bing, came to her son's assistance with
the exclamation, "You shan't take a boy
of mine out of here."
Then Connelly himself jumped out of
bed to help in overcoming the officer.
During the melee young Connelly's shirt
was torn off and he at once ran into a side
room and cut by a window onto a small
porch, whence ho jumped to the ground
and ran up Twenty-fourth street
After Heaphley had released himself
from the grip of the parents he went home
and cnanged his uniform for citizen's
clothes, and then returned in search of
the would-be murderer. He finally cap
tured the boy, who said he had been "try
ing his pistol."
WENT TO THE COUNCIL
The Labor Unions Sympathize
Witi the News
boys.
The Strike Still Being Prosecuted
With Unabated
Vigor.
The City evening papers came out yesterday
afternoon as usual and their wagons went up
and down the streets but not a newsboy took a
copy. The small curbstone dealer* collected
around and good-naturedly guyed the drivers
but aid not buy.
Occasionally a customer would brave the
wrath of the strikers and pay his nickel for a
copy, but the cry of "Scab, scab," would drive
the reckless purchaser around the corner.
Two delivery wagons, one driven by News
boy E. Dougherty and the other by Newsboy
Tap Williams, went around town with loads
of Oakland papers with which they supplied
the youngsters, checking back the unaold
copies.
"If the evening papers came out like the
morning papers, we would take our copies say
about half-past 3 or 4 o'clock, and take our
chances in selling them, because then we
would have several hours to get them off."
said one of the boys. "But our customers
always want the last edition aud we have to
get ltas it comes out, so there you are."
Tap Williams stated last night that a com
mittee of boys had visited the large clothing
houses, requesting themfl to withdraw their
advertisements from the Post, Bulletin and
Report, and they had received much encour
agement from the merchants.
The Hub and Raphaels readily promised to
do so, and the latter firm would do as they did
during the newsboys' strike of 1892â hire a
band for (he boys' parade and provide them
with torches, banners and transparencieg.
A committee of newsboys presented them
selves before the Labor Council last evening
and stated their grievances. They denied that
the newsboys were in the habit of picking up
abandoned papers in restaurants and offices
late at night and checking them in next
morning. They said that an offer had been
made to let the newsboys have four papers for
a nickel without the privilege of checking
bacfc . This, they said, would ba satisfactory.
The answer of the Labor Council was given
in the following resolution:
Rr solved, Tlmt the newsboys have the sympathy
of the Ban Francisco Labor Council in ihelr
struggle to better their condition.

SCORES OF RIFLES
GUARD THE FLAG
See Yups' Sacred Emblem
Watched by Armed
Highbinders.
They Will Shoot Down the Man
Who Attempts to De
stroy It.
FUNERAL OF GIN LUM CHEE.
Private Detective Cullundan Arrested
and Charged With Malicious
Mischief.
A hundred rifles in the hands of grim
visaged highbinders, men who will com
mit warder and gloat over the deed, guard
the Chinese flag which floats over the See
Yup Headquarters on Clay street and
Waveriy place. The fignting men who
guard the sacred bit of bunting are hidden
away on the roofs of adjoining buildings,
behind chimneys and firewalls.
They seldom show themselves, but
watch the actions of an expected intruder
with jealous eyes.
Every wave of the flag is a slap of de
fiance at tne Chinese Consul, and every
eye that watches it his secret enemy. Not
withstanding the fact that imperial de
cree has ordered ti;e See Yup Company
to lay down the hatchet, the man who
would attempt to lower that flag would
be riddled with flying bullets.
Sergeants Price and Henderson, having
charge of the Chinatown squad, were in
formed yesterday afternoon that the rifle
men had taien their position to defend
the flag and to defy the officers. The ser
geantt immediately sought the roofs of
buildingÃ adjoining the Lee Yup head
quarters in search of the would-be mur
derers.
As they hurried over the roofs a Chinese
head would bob up occasionally through a
skylight or air well ard then disappear.
Search for the pagan guards was useless
and the chase was abandoned.
Gin Lum Chee, who was shot in China
town by Ah Wah on the evenine of the
4t. r . iiist. and died a few days later, was
buried in the Chinese cemetery yesterday
morning. His funeral was a large one,
and was attended by most elaborate cere
monies.
Private Detective F. H. Callundan was
arrested yesterday and cnarged with ma
licious mischief at the instance of Lee
Hem, a member of the See Yiips. It was
he and his aesistants who, at the instiga
tion of the Chinese Consul, did the smash
ing of bric-a-brac in the apartments of the
See Yups at 820 Clay street.
LOUIE QUONG DISMISSED
Dick Williams' Side Partner
No Longer in the
Service.
Secretary Curtis Tells How the Mongol
Lost His Official Head Three
Months Ago.
Louie Quong, for many months Chinese
interpreter under Collector Wise, and who
first came into prominence through his
close relationship with ex-Customs In
spector Dick Williams, has been dis
missed from the service. Collector Wise
said on Tuesday last:
"Louie Quong has not been dismissed
from the service, though, of course, his
appointment, like that of any other inter
preter, is only by the day."
"In the event he is acquitted of the
pharge now resting against him, will he
be given his old position?" asked the re
porter.
"That is a matter I cannot answer,"
said theJCollector. "If he is acquitted I
will submit the matter to the department
and be guided largely by any suggestion
it might make. At the present time, how
ever, I can see no reason why Quong
should not again net as interpreter, pre
suming, of course, that he comes out of
the present trouble all right."
On the heels of tins very positive state
ment from Collector Wise comes the fol
lowing from The Call's Washington cor
respondent:
WASHINGTON, D. C, Oct. 16.â The Call
correspondent to-day made inquiry at the
Treasury Department concerning the report
that Louie Quong, Chinese interpreter in tho
Immigration Bureau at Ban Francisco, had
been dismissed from the service. Assistant
Secretary Curtis, under whose supervision are
conducted all matters of immigration, said:
"Yes, it is true that Louie Quong, the inter
preter, was dismissed trom the service, and Col
lector Wise was advised of the fact on
July 15."
Another official was more communicative
and said :
"Quong's dismissal wan due to his com
plicity with Inspector K. S. Williams in ad
mitting Chinese who had no right to enter
United States ports. Inspector Williams was
dismissed, and has since been convicted and
sentenced for taking bribes from Chinese
immigrants and Chinese Immigration com
panies.
"The secret service division of the Treasury
Department suspected that the interpreter,
Louia Quong, was an accomplice. He was
suspended April 16 last by order of this de
partment, pending an investigation, and when
It was ascertained to our satisfaction that he
was a confederate the Secretary, July 15, no
tified Collector Wise that he was dismissed,
his dismissal to take effect on the date of his
suspension.
"I cannot understand why his dismissal has
not already been made public In San Fran
cisco, but li is known here that Collector Wise
firmly believed in the innocence of Inspector
Williams and presumably he has been equally
reluctant to believe in the guilt of the inter
preter."
Louie; Quong, it will be remembered,
was recently indicted by the Federal
Grand Jury for perjury in a criminal case
which came before Commissioner Heacock
some months ago. The interpreter was
suspended within a few days of the time
Dick Williams was shelved, and he was
indicted in August last. This phase of
the case, however, did not come until
some time after the dismissal of the Chi
nese from the Government service. All
these tacts taken collectively give a most
peculiar complexion to the attitude as
sumed by Mr. Wise.
Quong enjoys a unique position in cus
toms circles. He is regarded as a tricky,
shifty sort of fellow, with the faculty of
gaining complete mastery over those with
wliom he comes in close touch.
It is said that some months ago he
loaned a prominent Federal officer $2000,
and that he still holds the gentleman's
"promise to pay." There are some, there
fore, who admire Quong immensely and
there are others who hold to the opinion
that the Grand Jury dealt lightly with the
Chinese when they returned only one per
jury charge against him.
Quong's trial has been set for October 26.
Those who keep track of such things will
watch the with interest, enhanced
somewhat by the statement of Collector
Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria.

HE MADE A GUN PLAY,
Dr. Campbell's Rash Act in a
Court of Jus
tice.
The Plaintiff Took the Hint and
Left the Courtroom Hur
riedly.
J. fi. Campbell, a physician, whose resi
dence is at Twenty-fourth and Valencia
streets, created a sensation in Justice
Groezinger's court yesterday by a gun
play in pantomime, and the excitement
was further heightened by the sudden and
precipitate exit of the defendant in the
case at whom the play was directed.
Dr. Campbell and his wife separated
some time ago and Andrew Todd, who
acted as a kind of mutual talebearer be
tween the two, was employed by the
doctor to remove Mrs. Campbell's goods
and chattels to her new abode, his com
pensation being fixed at $12 50. From the
testimony it appeared that Todd collected
from both ends and that Mrs. Campbell
gave up $12 50 as well as the doctor.
Somehow it Decame known to the doc
tor that his wife had also paid the mover's
fee, and he sued Todd for the return of
the money.
In his answer Todd averred that the
physician was indebted to him to the ex
tent of several hundred dollars, but
waived all except enough to offset the
doctor's claim and costs.
While a witness for the plaintiff was
being examined yesterday Dr. Campbell,
who was sitting near Todd, suddenly
dove his right hand into his hip pocket
and shook the index linger of bis disen
gaged hand first in Todd's face and then
toward the door.
Todd evidently took the hint, for be
fore any one else had comcre bended the
meaning of tlie dumb show he bolted out
of the door, and the doctor settled back in
his chair with a satisfied smile.
As tuere was really no overt act com
mitted the Justice could take no official
cognizance of tlie matter. Later Todd
admitted his liability, and judgment was
given for the plaintiff with costs.
BLAINE REPUBLICANS.
Nominees Address the Meeting In
K. R. B. Hall and Are Applauded.
The Blame Republican Club met last
night in K. R. B. Hall, Mason and O'Far
reli streets, aud heard addresses by some
of the leading candidates on the Republi
can ticket, Ex-Sheriff Thomas Desmond
presided, and with few exceptions all
present were citizens.
John J. Suliivan delivered a speech on
the issues of the campaign. He told his
audience that four years ago the Demo
cratic party in its platform denounced pro
tection as a fraud, a snare and unconstitu
tional. The effect of these doctrines is
that men have been walking the streets
and begging bread to sustain life. His
tory has proved that whenever the coun
try resorted to free trade stagnation in all
branches of industry followed. He de
clared that protection is the best thing for
the farmer, lor it caused the products of
the farm to be consumed at home, and the
home market is the best for America.
"It is better for California that warships
are made at the Union Iron Works," said
the speaker, presenting this decidedly ef
fective view of protection to home manu
factures.
"The ships are made here and the
money for ttieir construction goes to the
grocer, the baker, the butcher and trades
men of all descriptions. If the same
money were spent elsewhere then Califor
nia would be so much the poorer and tho
tradesmen and workingmen so much
worse off. It is exactly the same with pro
tection in its fullest sense."
The speaker was loudly applauded.
After this there was some music, and the
nominees, including Colonel Taylor,
Thomas B. O'BrieD, William Deane,
George Elder, Dr. William T. Kippler, Dr.
Soper and Thomas Ward, addressed the
meeting.

NO DIVISION
IN THE SYNOD
The Presbyterian Ministers
Postpone It for Another
Year.
A Favorable Report Was Made
on the Occidental College
Endowment.
SCHEDULED SUNDAY SERMONS.
Election of Officers of the Woman's
Synodical Society of Home
Missions.
Moderator Rev. George Giflord of the
Stockton Presbyterian church presided
over the second day's business of the an
nual session of the synod of California.
The morning session was opened with
devotional services by Rev. T. F. Burn
ham or Vallejo, and was taken up with
the reading of the treasurer's report,
which was accepted, and other routine
matters. The committee on overtures
and bills reported progress and retired for
further consultation. Arrangements were
made for a visit to the Theological Semin
ary, the San Rafael Presbyterian church,
the Presbyterian Orphanage and the
Mount Tamalpais Academy on Monday
next. It was explained that these excur
sions were of the utmost importance.
Most encouraging reports were received i
from Rev. S. S. Palmer of the committee j
on Theological Seminary examinations.
He said the missionary meeting of the j
students was almost all that could be de- I
sired, and far better than was expected.
He witnessed the examination of Dr. Mac
kenzie's class and of the classes in Greek
and Hebrew. "On the whole," he con
cluded, "it seems to be that our profes
sors are bringing our San Anselmo Sem
inary on a level with our Eastern sem
inaries"
R. M. Stevenson reported for the com
mittee on Pacific Coast synods.that owing
to the financial depression a joint meeting
of the synods would be impracticable.
Some of the delegates thought a joint
synod meeting in this City could be ar
ranged for the Christian Endeavor meet
ing of next year. A motion to that effect
was made and the committee was instruct
ed to consider it.
In order to allay the unrest in regard to
the theological seminaries of the State Dr.
Fraser made a motion to withdraw the
resolutions made last year requiring that
the elections be subject to the veto of the
general assembly, and that the directors
annually make a report in writing to the
general assembly. Dr. Graham raised
some objection to the motion, which, after
discussion, was found to be technical, and
the resolution was withdrawn.
There was some discussion over the ex
pulsion of the First Church of Los An
geles, due to the misunderstanding among
its members over a distribution of the j
property. A motion was made to recon- !
sider the expulsion, and after some dis
cussion it was referred to the judiciary
committee.
The question of aiding the Occidental j
College was brought up. The college was
burned over a year aero and since then
the institution has been greatly dependent
upon the Los Angeles people. It was ex
plained that a site of seven acres,
between Los Angeles and Pasadena, has
. been offered to the college, providing a
$10,000 building is erected thereon. It was
also announced that the Presbyterian
Board of Aids in Chicago has added a do
nation of $5000 toward the endowment of
the college if the Presbyterians on this
side of the country will donate the
$10,000 for the building.
Dr. Dinsmore announced that the seven
acres offered would be deeded over imme
diately in trust, in escrow, for a reason
able time within which the Presbyterian
churches might cure the $10,000.
The synod acted favorably upon the re
quest of the Occidental College to grant it
$1500 for this coming year.
Rev. Dr. Stephens stirred up consider
able debate on his motion to bring up in
the morning an overture ; for the division
of the synod. This was resisted and ulti
mately defeated, the entire matter being
laid over to the meeting of the synod next
year. ,
Dr. James Curry of Temescal presented
the report of thÂ»Â» committee on ministerial
relief. He showed how over $89,000 bad j
been spent in the last year, relieving 306
families. Among them were thirty-seven
ministers and their families of the synod,
at a cost of $8465. As against this the re
port showed that only $1567 had been con
tributed by the churches.
However, Dr. Curry was pleased to state
that within the last year the contributions
from the churches had increased from
$1476 to $1567. This, the speaker said,
was a great showing, seeing that there are
but eighty- four contributing churches, as
against 143 non-contributing institutions.
General Cadwallader of San Jose,,for
merly of General Grant's staff, spoke to
the subject of ministerial relief and en
couraged the elders of the various
churches to take off the hands of the pas
tors the duty of collecting money for the
relief fund.
Dr. Hays presented a report on church
erection. Dr. H. P. McDonald's report
was on aid of colleges. Dr. Arthur Crosley
read a paper on the American Bible So
ciety.
The committee of arrangements pre
sented the following. schedule :of pulpit
supplies for to-morrow's services at the
various churches in this City and sur
rounding towns:

Suit Affaiugl^Diiuond's Kxecntors.
The Perm Mutual Life Insurance Company
yesterday filed a peculiar suit in the Tjnited
States Circuit Court against the Union Trust
Company and Edwin R. Dimond, executors of
the estate of \V. H. Dimond. It appears that
some years before his decease Genernl Dimond
insured his life for $10,000. In 1893 he as
signed the policy, or it is so alleged, to Theresa
Abell, who demanded payment of the com
pany. At the same time the executors also
i laid claim to the $10,000, with the result that
the insurance company was placed in a some
what embarrassing position. In order to be
on the safe side of the legal fence the Perm
Mutual Company seeks to have the executors
establish their claims to the money.
Pettit Is Acquitted.
George E. Pettit of Santa Rosa, who was in
dicted by the United States Grand Jury on a
charge of raising a $1 note to the denomina
tion of $20, was yesterday acquitted by a jury
in Judge Morrow's court. As Pet.it was with
out money a subscription was taken up among
the court officers sufficiently large to pay his
passage back home.
THE STOCK MARKET.
The bottom dropped out of Thursday afternoon's
boom yesterday and prices went down about as
fast as they bad gone up, as will be seen by the list
of sales. The drop was caused by less favorable
news from the front. At first It was reported that
three feet of ore had been oat in the bottom of in
cline shaft 1 In Norcross ground on the Brunswick
lode lying on the footwall, which the incline is
scalping along in its downward progress, and that
this ore gave an average assay of $38 per ton.
The shaft Is down about 650 feet on the slant, and
the point where the ore was found is about 50 feet
vertically below the 400 level, which is being
opened by north and south drifts from the shaft
station. Yesterday's news was that the assays
were much smaller than at first thongbt, hence
the break.
Superintendent Gorham makes the following
r*port of work don In the Savage-Brunswick
ground during the past week: Brunswick lode-
Shaft IâNo.1 â No. 1 shaft is down 64 feel on the s ope,
16 feet having been added during the week; the
footwa 1 is exposed ia [he bottom, on which lies a
streak of low grade quartz 2 feet wide.
On the 200 level Hie joint Savage-Norcross-
Chollar-Potosl vertical upraise has been advanced
7 feet and is now up 65 feet; top in hard rock. On
the 300 level the west crosscut, started 100 fee.
north of the south line, has been driven 18 feet
through porphyry and clay, at which point the
mum footwall was encountered. An eas crosscut
has been started opposite it and extended 38 feef
through porpuyry and clay, face being now in that
material. On the 4UO level -he joint Savage-Nor
cross north drift, under the supervision of the
Norcross company, has been extended 40 feet;
total length 175 feet: face in porphyry and clay,
which is good working gronnd.
At the recent annual meeting of the Comstock
Tunnel Company in .New York the fol owing di
rectors were elected: Franklin Leonard, R. nobart
Smith, Gordon M D maid, Alaurice M. Muhlmau,
Ambrose Leonard, H. H. Truman nnd E. B.
Gresby. FranUlin Leonard was re-elected presi

WAS ALMOST A
STREET RIOT
Two Streetcar Specials
Roughly Handled by
a Crowd.
The Gift of a Passenger's Trans
fer the Cause of the
Trouble.
TEIED TO RESCUE A PRISONEK
The Arrival of the Regular Police
Saved the Spatters From Being
. Overpowered.
There was a small riot on the corner of
Powell and MarKet streets iate yesterday
afternoon, caused by the attempt of two
spotters for the Market-street Cable Com
pany to arrest two young men for violat
ing the transfer ordinance. Had it not
been for the appearance of the police the
railroad employes would have been
roughly handled. As it was they were
beaten, kicked and cursed by the crowd, jt
Since the passage of the municipal law
known as ordinance 2993 forbidding the
traffic in streetcar transfers the companies
have had spotters or special officers around
the principal transfer points, and since
then the newsboys have been compelled
to deal in the s&\e of papers almost exclu
sively, where formerly they did a large
business in streetcar transfers.
Last evening Julius Forrnel, a young
electrician, took a transfer from the con
ductor of a Powell-street car, but instead
of boarding a Market-street car he Landed
the slip of cardboard to another person.
This act was observed by three peopleâ
Heriry Lefooitz, a newsboy, and the com-
Dany's special officers, A. Pratt and L.
Krouse. The young newspaper-peddler
saw Formel's danger and ran to him, ex
claiming "Cheese it, the spotter is on to
you I"
At that moment Krouse seized Formel,
whom he placed under arrest, and Pratt
seized Lefoojtz. The latter broke away
and ran to escape, out the snecial was too
swift for him, and the newsie was in his
clutches again. As Pratt seized tne lad the
secon.i time the two fell in a heap in the
gutter, the boy crying lustily.
By this time the public was taking an
interest in the case, and as the specials
â were marching away with their strug
gling prisoners men, women and small
boys were excited, and threatening mis
siles began to fly, ana Pratt and the boy
became separated from the others. He
made a break lor the building, dragging
the lad with him, and on the way he was
struck several times by men in the crowd.
One man. a peddler, went so far as to
whack the special with a club, smashing
his hat, and another pulled the captor's
whiskers vigorously.
At last he reached the building and
placed his back against the wall. Women
were active factors in the angry gather
ing by this time and their remarks were
not pleasant to hear. A number of men
drew aside and w-re about to make an
onslaught upon Pratt and rescue the
newsboy, but belore they could act half a
dozen policemen, attracted by the crowd,
put in an appearance and rescued the spe
cial from bis unhappy position.
Krouse, with his prisoner, had not fared
so ill, as be kept on the outskirts of tLe
crowd. His prisoner, being much larger
than the newsboy, did not create so much
sympathy, but even the special's position
was anything but pleasant, for he received
a vigorous tongue lashing from men,
women and boys alike.
The patrol-wagon was called, and the
specials with their prisoners were hurried
away to the central police station amid a
volley of abuse from the crowd. Formel
was charged with violating the transfer
ordinance and he was released on bail.
The newsboy was accused of having com
mitted a battery upon the company's ser
vant. The boy says that he didnot hit
Pratt, but that it was the peddler who
struck the blow.

The Four Principal Characters in the Fairy Operetta of "The Rival Queens/ to Be Given at the California Theater
This Afternoon.
FAIRYLAND AT
THE CALIFORNIA
The Operetta of " The Rival
Queens" This After
noon.
A Veritable Midsummer Night's
Dream Under the Electric
Lamps.
EIFINS, GOBLINS AND FAIRIES.
To Be G.ven lor the Benefit of th?
Children's Hosp tal by Ninety-
Six Performers.
This afternoon "Fairyland" will come
to the stage of tie California Theater and
under the mellow lieht the scene will be
a veritable "Midsummer Night's Dream."
Two rival queens will wave their wands
and contend for the sovereignty over tne
! elfin people forever. Among fairies there
I are sometimes little disagreements, which
happily soon end, and the sun, or rather
the moon, for fairies have no existence in
; the garish day, shines again.
Moreover, as the little sprites will come
j in the name of charity the common ob-
I ject of their appearance will banish the
I spirit of anything like "horrid war."
For several days the ladies and gentle
men interested in the cause of the Chil
dren's Hospital have been transforming
the California into a bower of woodland
beauty. The stage will be a forest where
the tiny mortals dwell. Real flowers and
| garlands will cover the painted scenes
and Queen Rose will rule her rural king
dom from a throne as blooming as her lit
tle majesty's title. And the elf guards,
the butterfly pages and the goblin attend
ants will be as real as ever trooped through
the courts of Mab.
The dainty operetta, "The Rival
Queens. 1 ' which was first given by its
ninety-six child performers in Alameda
with such success, was written by Miss
Camilla E. Lies and set to music by
Charles H. McCurrie. The piece this
afternoon is to be umier the direction of
the following ladies: Music, Mrs. Charles
Smith; dancing, Miss C. Gamble; stage
and elocution, Miss Beile McCurrie;
stage decoration, Miss Clara Fisher. Miss
Gamble will be assisted by Professor
Chapman, and the orchestral melodies
will be given by the pupils of the S lcred
Heart College of this Ci'y under the
leadership of Professor Shernstein.
The principal characters are: Rose,
queen of the fairies, Marjorie Moore,
aranddaughter of Captain Roberts of this
City; Nightshade, queen of goblins, Hazel
Thane of Niles. This young lady is the
bad little queen of the play, and disputes
with Rose the very throne of fairy land.
She even tries to captivate a "mortal,
Prince Leon, who has somehow Ptrayed
into the fay dominions, but, like all
villains, is foiled. The Prince is .Una
Fatrweather, daughter of Henri Fair
weather, the musician. Taifa, the elf
page to Rose, is Eileen McCurrie, and the
maids of honor, Lily and Violet, are
Marjorie Arnold and Marion Hovey re
spectively.
There is one lone masculine in all that
fairy realm of girls; but as he is Cupid be
Holds his own, as usual, in that fair com
pany. He is Edward yon Schmidt Jr., a
four-year-old, with golden baby-curls,
dove wmj^s and all the accessories of the
god of love. The rest of the cast is as
follows:
Butterfly pages that draw the chariot of
Queen Roseâ Hazel Royer, Alma Hoilenbeek,

CAVORTING ON TO DOOM
The Noa-Partisan Party Is Do
ing This, Says Mrs. Susan
Theall.
She Believes That BoJy Knows of the
Loss of the Woman's Liberal
League Sign
The Non-Partisan party of this City and
County is floundering onward to certain
doom. The abyss yawns just before, but
the fated company led by George K. Fitch,
ex-Mayor Ellert, Secretary Millikan and
others is cavorting straight ahead to the
eternal jump-off.
Tiiis is true, because the Woman's
Liberal League and anti-charter advocates
have said it, and this information, coming
from such a reliable source, goes.
The culminating sin of the doomed
party is u.e making away of the league's
sign. True, George K. Fitch, Ellert. Milli
ken, et al., deny the soft impeachment,
but Mrs. Susan Theall is satisfied in her
| own mind that these gentlemen â she says
j gentlemen with a heaven-save-the-mark
intonation â know a great deal more about
the loss of the league's sign than they
would have her know they know.
The Non-Partisans and Woman's Lib
eral League occupy the Nucleus building
together, but they don't dwell together in
sweet accord. The latter put out their $8
sign on the side of the big house facing
Market street, on a line with and between
the two signs of the political party. It
was of the same style of lettering and
painted in the same colors as was the
other, and the passers on the pavement
were enabled to read this legend:
NON-PARTISAN. ANTI - CHARTER
LITERATURE.
As that party is anything but anti-char
ter tbeie came on trouble. Secretary Mii
liken appealed to Agent Clark of the
Hearst estate, who tried to have the league
legend removed, but Mrs. Tneall, who has
charge of the literature bureau, stuck to
her colors and swore an in-hoc-signo
vinces oath that she would appeal to the
police if they molested the league litera
ture on the side o> the building. *
The next morning the sign was gone â
had folded its tent like the Arab, etc.
Mrs. Theali bearded Mr. Miihken in his
lair, and it is written in the minutes of
the meeting that she spoke her mind.
There were threats of invoking the police
power from both sides, and the Jady de
parted filled with the hope that she would
live to behold the downfall of her political
enemies. When she was interviewed last
evening she had not forgiven nor for
gotten.
"A party," said she "that would steal a
sign belonging to another party is not fit
to win at the polls, and neither shall they
do so. The league is liberal in all things,
but not in signs. We have offered a re
ward of $10 lor the names of those persons
who went up on the top of that building
last Sunday night and took away our
property.
"If Deacon Fitch or 'Mayor Ellert or
Secretary â but I won't say any more. It
was an outrage â a miserable Non- Partisan,
new charter, A. P. A. outrage, and I hope
you won't say anything about it, at least
until we unearth the wretches."
So the Non-Partisan party madly
cavorts onward to its doom.
Eight experienced divers are carried on

ROBBERY OF THE
HISTORY PLATES
The Grand Jury Is Seeking
to Penetrate the
Mystery.
Charles 0. Richards, Manager
for Bancroft, Heard As
a Witness.
AN INDICTMENT FOB LIBEL.
Spurious Signatures to Petitions Ask
ing for Recognition on the
0 ficial Ballot
The Bancroft History robbery was the
subject of Grand Jury investigation yes
terday afternoon. Unusual precautions
were taken to render the inquiry secret.
It does not appear that the police are tak
ing any steps in the affairs of investiga
tion.
Some incidents connected with the re
ported attempt at robbery are peculiar, If
not remarkable. The load of plates which
an employe, or ex-employe, of the History
Company was seeking to remove from the
area under the sidewalk somehow ob
tained a valuation of $10000.
Among the plates winch, it is charged,
the attache of the History Company at
tempted to purloin, were some which
belonged to the history factory. The cul
prit, it is saia, occupied, or did occupy,
the position of porter.
It is possbie that the Grand Jury in
vestigation will disclose a conspiracy on
the part of persons now unknown to ob
tain possession of the History plates.
The chief witness yesterday was Charles
O. Richards, president of the History
Company. His testimony showed that
the iilates were not taken from t lie area
under the sidewalk and piaced on the ele
vator for delivery to ti e express wagon by
any one acting in Mr. Bancroft's behalf.
Mr. Weir testihed m the same case.
The testimony disclosed the fact sureiy
that an attempt to purloin history plates
was discovered and frustrated. The mys
tery involved is bow the plates can be
worth more than their weight in old
metal to persons other than those pos
sessed of history secrets.
The Grand Jury took the matter under
consideration. It can be definitely assert
ed that no indictment was found yester
day, although the subject was discussed
at length.
The Grand Jury yesterday filed into
Judge Slack's court and presented an in
dictment tor misdam anor libel against
Jerome Mnlard. The accused was
released on a bail bond of $1000,
with Joseph A. Kelly and Frank Lavvior
as sureties. Miilard is the man who pro
cured the lettering and public display of a
banner bearing an inscription reflecting
upon Police Judge C. A. Low.
Garret McEnerney and Deputy Regis
trar Welch presented to the Grand Jury
on behalf of Registrar Hinton a petition
from the Citizens' Independent party, an
other from the Free Si.ver Protection
party and two from candidates) all ad
dressed to the Registrar. An examination
and comparison of the petitions led the
Registrar to believe that many of the
names thereon are fictitious and fraudu
lent signatures.
The handwriting of many of the names
is obviously that of the same person.
Some of the names written are obscene
and others represent "tomfoolery."
Paul A. Ayhens makes the affidavit at
tached to the petition of the Citizens' In
dependent party that cbe signatures are
genuine and each was signed by trie per
son whose signature it is purported to be.
P. A. Dolan signs a similar affidavit at
tached to the petition of the Free Silver
and Protection party. Registrar Hinton
declined to recognize- the Dolan ticket and
the latter has applied for a writ of man
date to compel that recognition. The Cit
izens' Independent party lias been recog
nized and its candidates will have a place
on the official, ballot.
The penalty for attaching spurious sig
natures to a petition of this character is
very severe. The Political Code provides
that a person convicted of the offense may
be imprisoned for five years.
Garret McEnerney, representing Regis
trar Hinton, has pla<ed all the facts in the
possession of the District Attorney, and
the case is bound to receive the closest at
tention of the Grand Jury. The attention
of the Registrar 'has been particularly
directed to P. A. Dolan, who is said to be
quite active as an organizer of'new parties
for special occasions.
The Grand Jury yesterday listened to
the testimony of Oscar Lewis, Deputy
County Clerk, and several other witness, s
in a case growing out of the arrest of Ag
gie Abbott on a charge of stealing jewelry.
It seems that a man named Rooels made
an affidavit before Depuiy Lewis that he
(Robels) had taken the jewelry which the
woman was accused of stealing. The man
whose property was stolen made a state
ment to the jury.

SOCIETY AT A SYMPHONY.
Auspicious Opening of the Hin
richs â¢ Beel Con
certs.
The Baldwin Is Crcwded With an
Audience Chi fly Composed
of Ladies.
Both professionals, musicians and
society amateurs turned out in force to the
opening concert of the Hinrichs - Beei
series, which took place yesterday after
noon in the Baldwin Theater. Scarcely
a seat was unoccupied and though
the audience was largely composed of
ladies, which accounted for the applause
not being noisy or vociferous, the appro
bation expressed was both warm and in
telligent.
The personnel of the orchestra included
some of the best-known local players. Mr.
Hinrichs had shown considerable judg
ment in balancing his instruments. Two
seasons ago Echeel made local audiences
familiar with the ctiief orchestral num
ber of yesterday's programmeâ the Dvo
rak symphony, the "Leonore" overture,
No. 3, and the Vorspiel from the "Meister
singer" â but without entering into com
parisons between the two renderings the
difference in the balance of instruments
was at once apparent yesterday. Gifted
conductor as he was Scheel always seemed
to have a rooted oojection to making his
strings quite strong enough.
If Dvorak's sojourn in New York, with
all its neglect and heartburnings, had re
sulted in nothing but the beautiful sym
phony "From the New World," the end
would be well worth the time the Bohe
mian composer spent in America. It is
telling an oft-told tale to say that Dvorak
made his themes characteristic of planta
tion melodies. The rendering given to the
Symphony yesterday afternoon was
smooth, flowing and thoroughly sympa
thetic; the shading was delicate in the
extreme and the climaxes were dramatic.
The plaintive, slow movement, known as
"Hiawatha's WoDintr," appealed most to
the audience, to judge from the applause
awarded it, but all the movements were
excellently played. The scherzo was as
easy and jocund as a jest and the allegros
were full of brilliancy.
Beethoven's No. 2, "Leonore" overture,
had probably not been quite so thoroughly
rehearsed as ths symphony, for lhere
were one or two ragged passages, but they
were too few and far between to mar the
general excellence of the performance.
Tscbaikowsky's ballet 'Dornrceschen,"
from the "Sleeping Beauty," has such a
strongly marked time and swinging
rhythm that the audience refused to take
the great Russian composer's ballet music
quite seriously and gave it less appiau.se
than any other part of the programme.
A good vocalist generally carries off the
palm in the way of applause, however
serious the tastes of the audience, and the
r ception given Maurice de Vries was no
exception to this rule. His aria from
"The Flying Dutchman," which he sang
in French, was so dramatically rendered
that the drops of perspiration bad to be
mopped from his manly brow. In re
sponse to a vociferous demand for an en
core. M. de Vries obliged with the prologue
to "I Pagliacci," in Italian, and the en
thusiusm of the audience could scarcely
be restrained till he had finished his
spiendid rendering of the best bit of vocal
work in Leoncavallo's opera.
The next symphony concert will take
place on the 30th inst.
