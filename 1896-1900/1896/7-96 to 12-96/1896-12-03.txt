FITZSIMMONS WAS ROBBED.
FITZSIMMOIISjmS
Knocked Out Tom Sharkey
but Lost on an Al
leged Foul.
REFEREE EARP GAVE A
S RAW DECISION.
The Cornishman Was Warned
f Against Accepting the Ex Faro
. Dealing Sharp.
ONLY ONE MAN IN THE FIGHT
FROM START TO FINISH.
Lon Agnew Won From Muller After Six Hard
RoundsâAn Immense Crowd Filled the
PavilionâCrowd Yelled Fake.
The alleged gun-fighter, Wyatt Earp,
.who "is best known as the bodyguard of
Long Green Lawrence, of the Examiner,
robbed Bob Pitzsimmons of a well-earned
victory over Tom Sharkey in the mo3t
barefaced manner last night.
The sailor, who' fought foul all through
the eight rduids of the battle, went down
from a hook on the chin and a terrific left
diive in the pit of the stomach, and the
crowd got up to go with the impression
. that Bob had won.
But men the slouchy would-be referee
gave the decision'to the sailor on a foul,
and the house howled iv derision and
would not believe it until Fitz.-inimons
himself confirmed the story by protesting
against tbe outrage.
It was the most bald-faced steal that has
"â¢vjer been seen in the San Fnanci9co prize
ring and will do much to hurt boxine on
this coast if, indeed, it does not kill it
eniirely. '
Earp did not wait to see what effect the
decision would have on the crowd, but
sneaked from the ring while Fitz' friends
wei^e crowding about the big Cornishman
to congratulate him and was far away
when the crowd understood aud began to
yell "Fake," "Steal" and other expressions
of that character.
It is safe to say that his fake reputation
as a bad man from Arizona would not
have saved his bide bad the ciowd been
able to get hands on him.
He showed the "yellow dog" in him by
going into the ring with a Colt's navy re
volver in his pocket, indicating that he
feared trouble over the decision that he
knew he would give if opportunity offered.
When Captain Wittman saw it pushing
out hiscoattails he demanded tbegun.and
it was only after repeated orders from the
big police officer that Earp gave up the
weapon on which he depends for a living.
The Fitzsimmond people knew when
they entered the ring something was
wrong, and when -the c/ub management
announced that Fakir Earp was its
choice â tbe managers of the men having
failed to agree on a man â they protested
aeainst him.
Julian, who talked for Fitz, said to the
throng that they had originally been satis
lied with the alleged gun-tighter, but that
just before the fight they had heard that
Earp was fixed for Sharkey.
"We are satisfied with any other nan in
the house," he said, "but we don't want
this man," pointing to Earp. "We don't
want to be kickers, but we want at least a
fair show. Let them choose any other
man and we will be ready."
Earp hung his head during the speech.
The wrangle grew too Jong for Fitz and he
finally sprang from his chair and said:
â¢â¢I* have given in to everything in this
matter and I will give in to this. Let's
get at it."
That slip of judgment cost Jfitz $10,000,
but not a whit of his reputation, for not a
fair-minded man in the audience saw
more than one man in the fight, and that
man was Bob Fitzsimmons.
He simply smothered the sailor and
won the good will of the crowd, which
was at first with Bnarkey, by the great
fairness with which he fought. When he
Professor Watson, "Tfje Call's" Authority on Boxing.
Professor Walter Watson, boxing instructor at the Olympic Club, was secured
by The Call to write a technical report of the big contest by rounds. Such a re-
port is of especial value, because Professor Watson has proba-
I bly seen more boxing contests than any other man in Califor-
I nia, having been connected with the sport as a participant,
I in structor and referee since he was 18 years of age. He knows all
I the points of the game and has brought out a score of ama-
I teur and professional champions, including James J. Corbett.
Professor Watson was born in London in 1854. He com-
I menced boxing when but 18 years old, weighing at that time
I 140 pounds, bis first experience being gained at old Nat Lang-
I ham's, a place then known to all London. He won several
I tournaments with gloves and bare knuckles, being the cbam-
I pion fn his class. At 20 he commenced giving instructions in
I boxing, being engaged at different times by all the prominent
I boxing clubs of London. He brought out eleven different
I champions, at various weight?.
In the summer of 1883 Mr. Watson came to New York
I teachine boxing at Wood's Gymnasium, and a( the New York
I Amietic Club. He was engaged by the Olympic Club of this
I City in 1385 as boxing instructor, and has retained that poni
| tion ever since, with the exception of snort intervals when he
was employed in a similar capacity by the Acme and Reliance Clubs of Oakland
when those clubs first started.
As a teacher of the manly art Professor Watson has few equals. During his
stay on the coast ne has brought out such champions as Corbett, Jack Kitchen, Billy
Gallagher, Stewart Carter, Joe Reay, T. Van Buskirk, Milton Hayes and dozens
of others. *.

helped Sharkey through the ropes after
knocking him in that position he bad the
crowd to a man.
Sharkey's persistent attempts to throw
Bob by catching him by the legs, and his
striking in a cinch after agreeing in the
ring not to do so, showed very unfavor
ably against the Cornishman's fair break
aways.
The rawness of Fakir Earps' decision
was emphasized by the action of the
sailor's friends after he had been carried
to his dressing-room.
When they were asked about his condi
tion they said he was badly hurt and that
a physician was with him.
No one but bis backer and the manage
ment of the club were allowed inside, and
even the latter were not let in until he
had been dressed.
Two or three reputable physicians who
came to the door were told that Dr. Lustig j
was inside and were turned away.
Later, when an interview was requested
with Dr. Lustig, the information was
given that he was not there and bad not
been there.
It was seen when Sharkey was carried
out and into the carriage that no physi
cian was in the room.
As a matter of fact no doctor was al
lowed to see Sharkey and ud to the time
he left his room all the proof that he
had been fouled was the say so of his
trainers and the backer. His trunks
FITZ SAYS HE WAS ROBBED.
To Dan A. Stuart Esq., Dallas, Tex.
We were robbed to-night, but this outrageous decision
will not make any difference in our plans. Fitz will meet
both Sharkey and Corbett in the same ring any time you are
ready to arrange the match. MARTIN JULIAN.

were not even removed to see whether he
was hurt.'
Later when a Dr. Lee had examined
Sbarkey and pronounced him injured, an
effort was made to ascertain something
about the doctor, but as his name does
not appear in the register of regular
physicians issued in January, 1896, ' it was
in vain.
Dr. Wadsworth, secretary of the Board
of Examiners of the regular public
schools, said last night that be bad never
heard of Dr. Lee. and could not give any
information on the subject.
On the streets after the fight nothing
but the manner in which Fitzsimmons
was robbed was heard and if Faker Earp's
ears did not tingle it was because they
were hardened by long experience in this
line.
HOW THE BATTLE
WAS FOUGHT.
The first man to enter the ring was
Fitzsimmons, wbo stepped through th
ropes at 10:09 p. m. and was cheered
loudly. He was covered by a light-col
ored bathrobe, and was followed by his
seconds, Manager Julian, Dan Hicky and
Jack Stelzner. He immediately crossed
to the west side of the ring, reached down
and shook hands with Major Frank Mc-
Laughlin. Master of Ceremonies Billy
Jordan undid the parcel holding two pairs
of gloves and handed them to Captain of
Police Wittman, who examined them,
looked satisfied and tossed them on the
floor in the center of the ring. Fitzslm
mcns went back to his corner after his
short chaji with Major McLaughlin, and
sat down, rubbing his feet in the rosin
before him. Tiien hÂ« arose and walked
back to where Major McLaughlin was sit
ting and they had anotn-r short conversa
tion.
Four minutes later Sharkey came i'rom
his dressing-room and climbed through
the ropes into the rine, accompanied by
his manager, Danny Lynch, and his train
ers, Danny Needham, Austrailian Billy
Smith and George Allen. He was re
ceived with great applause, receiving a
much better reception 4han did Fitzsim
mons. He had on a light robe, similar to
his opponent's.
Fitzsimmons then rose from his seat,
walked over to Bharkey's corner, which
was the southwest corner of the ring, and
shook hands with him. He walked back
to his corner, turned around and epoke to
one of hia seconds, laughing at the same
time. Fitzsimmons weighed in at 173U
pounds and Sharkey at 182.
Fitzsimmon*|sat in his corner with a
very confident air, leaning his arms on his
legs.which were spread far apart. ?' arkey
sat perfectly still and erect, listening to
something Billy Jordan was saying to
him. Martin Julian and Danny Need
ham were engaged in an animated cbn
versation,Â£vidently about a referee, along
side. The men remained this way for
several minutes, while the crowd talked
and yelled, and yelled and cheered alter
nately. SharKey rinsed out his mouth
with a little water and Fitzsimmons
rubbed some resin on his hands and then
leaned forward on his legs again, twid
dlinz his fingers and looking very uncon
cerned.
Manager Gibbs then climbed through
the ropes and talked with Martin Julian.
There was evidently trouble about the
referee. They both crossed the ring and
talked with Major McLaugulin.
At 10:16 o'clock Sharkey threw aside
his robe and stepped to the center of the
ring, when Billy Jordan introduced him
to the crowd as "Thomas Sharkey, the
pride of the American navy and* the
cnampion of the Pacific Coast." He was
received with great cheering. Sharkev
was clad in green tights, with the Ameri
can flag draped as a belt. He looked in
splendid condition, though perhaps a lit
tle finely drawn.
Sharkey walked back to his chair and
then Mr. Jordan introduced "Robert
Fitzsimmons, thechampion of the world."
He was cheered heartily, though not so
loudly as was Sbarkey. Fitz walked back
to his corner and then another delay
ensued. Fitz watched Sharkey closely,
'sizing him up.' 1 Ha also looked about
tbe house, bowing here and there, and
looked very happy and unconcerned.
Billy .lonian then went to the ropes and
called" for "Wyatt Earp," repeating the
name several times. Mr. Earp came for
ward and climbed turough the ropes.
Captain Wittman talked with him a few
moment*.
"Gentlemen," said Billy Jordan, evi
dently unmindful of the half a hundred
ladies present, ''Mr. Wyatt Earp has been
selected as referee." The crowd cheered
ana some few hissed. "But owing to re
marks that are going around that there is
something crooked about Earp,'' contin
ued Jordan, "which Mr. Julian has heard,
he refuses to accept Mr. Earp as referee."
The crowd yelled and hissed long and
loudly. Fitzsimmons rubbed his hands
with more resin and smiled.
Captain Wittman went to the ringside
and called to Danny Lynch, SharKey's
manager, who climbed into the ring.
Martin Julian, Fitzsimmons' manager,
then went to the ropes and addressed the
crowd, saying: "I want to announce that
Mr. Sharkey's manager, the club officials
and myself met and tried to select a
referee. I named half a dozen, among
whom was Hiram Cook, and several
others. Mr. Lynch objected to all of them.
The club then selected Mr. Earp. ['A
good man,' yelled somebody in the gal
lery ; some cheered this sally, others hissed
it.] When we first heard that Mr. Earp
had been selected be was satisfactory to
us," continued Air. Julian, "but since 6:30
o'clock this evening several sporting men
belonging to San Francisco have come
and told us that the referee is fixed."
["Name them," cried the man in the gal
lery again, and the crowd cheered.]
Then Mr. Lynch tooK the platform. He I
said: "Gentlemen, Mr. Fitzsimmons' rep
sentative and myself, in conjunction with
l be officers of the club, met. Mr. Sharkey
has lived up to every article he agreed to,
and is here ready" and willing to ficht,
with the referee selected by the club."
The yells that followed this announcement
were deafen ine. The noise lasted for a
couple of minutes.
Then Danny Needham went to the cen
ter of the ring, selected a pair of gloves
and brought them over and put them on
Sharkey.
Mr. Jordan then announced: "Mr.
Julian is willing to select any referee in
house." ["Wvatt Earp!" yelled a hun
dred voices.] Manager Gibbs then climbed
through the ropes, making eleven persons
within the inclosure.
Jordan crossed to the west sida and
said: "Mr. Julian is willing to select
Hiram Cook, or any other good referee."
T c crowd at the west end cheered and
called for "Hiram Cook." Jordan went
to different sides, calling for Mr. Cook,
but be did not appear. Somebody yelled :
"Get Judge Campbell," and the crowd
laughed.
Then Fitzsimmons stood up and raised
his hand for silence, and the house
quieted. He said: "I have given in in all
my fights, and I will give in in this one."
The crowd cheered. He continued : "There
is one thing he will have to do, thoueh â
trke the bandages off bis hands. I have
noae on mine." The crowd cheered and
cried: "Take them off. Sbarkey.'' Billy
Jordan announced: "Mr. Fitzsimmons ac
cepts Mr. Earp for referee."
With this Fitzsimmons pulled on his
gloves, assisted by his seconds. Shar
key's seconds took the bandages off his
wrists. Hickey, one of Fitzsimmons' sec
onds, walked over and fell of Sharkey's
gloves. Referee Earp took off his coat
and prepared for business, while Bharkey
took another gargle of water and Fitz
rubbed bis shoes in the rosin-box.
Billy Jordan then announced: "This
will be a ten-round contest, and the con
ditions are that at the end of the ten
rounds the man having the best of the
contest will be awarded the decision. The
certified cbeck for $10,000 is now in the
referee'd hands."
Fitzsimmons; stood up and so did
Sharkey. Their seconds left the ring.
They stepped to the center and shook
hands. Fitz did not look much taller
than his opponent. Fitz put his hands on
Sharkpy's shoulder, evidently illustrating
a break-away. Both shook again after the I
referee spoke to them and Fitz said, "May
the best man win."
Billy Jordan then announced: "The j
men have agreed in a clinch to break away .
fair and square and not do any fighting, j
Here is the check for $10,000," waving |
aloft a check-shaped piece of white paper. |

Fitzsimmons' timekeeper, Hereford, did
not get his watch set right with the gong
and another delay ensued. Sharkey's sec
onds pusned a chair through the ropes to
him and he sat down. "Sit down, Fitz,"
yelled the man in the gallery, but he
shooic his head and laughed, leaning on
the ropes and looking around.
At 10:46 the gong sounded for the first
rcund:

NEAR PACIFIC GROVE.
Two Fishermen Say They Saw the.-"'
Airship on the Ocean Beach..*).
PACIFIC GROVE, Cal., Dec. 2.â ThW
the problem of navigating* the *air has at
last been successfully solved theft no*,
longer remains a doubt.
At an early hour this morning, some
fifteen miles from this city, two Itafiari
fishermen, Giuseppe Valinzianpand Luigi
Valdivia, while engaged in their vocation,
were complete! y terrorized by seeing 'an
object descending from the heavens,
which to their terror-stricken imagina
tions seemed to be falling directly upon
their boat. When the object had fallen
within some few hundred yards of the
water it floated easily and at a moderate
speed until it landed on the sandy beach.
The airship, for sucu it proved to! "be,
seemed to be under the perfect control of '
its occupants, three in number.
Immediately on landing they alighted
and picking up their ship, carried it back
from the beach and into the woods. As
boon as the two fishermen had recove/ed
from their astonishment they drew in
their nets and attempted to make a land
ing, and after several unsuccessful â¢at
tempts to get through the surf, which was
very rough, a landing was made.
During this time the persons who had
bo strangely appeared upon the scone "
were watching the actions of the fisher
men, and upon the first signs of a success
ful landing one of the party advanced to â¢
meet them and warned them away from
the spot where the ship was concealed.
But Valinziano, who is a man of consider
able intelligence, was not to be got rid of
so easily, and engaged the aeronaut in
conversation with the intention of learn- .
ing as much as possible concerning the
strange visitor. At first the man who, had
met them at the water's edge refused to
answer any questions or allow the two
fishermen to proceed further toward the
spot where the ship was located, threaten
ing to use force if necessary to prevent
their doing so, but finally seeing that
Valinziano and his companion were de
termined not to leave withont obtaining
at least a glimpse of the aerial traveler
milder counsels prevailed.
Telling them to remain where they were
until he could consult with his com
panions the aeronaut left them and disap
peared in the woods, remaining away
some fifteen minutes, and on his reap
pearance beckoned Valinzano and his
companion to advance.
Upon their arrival at the edge of the
woods they were met by the entire party.
One who appeared to be the leader cour
teously bade them 'Good morning" and
said: "I suppose your curiosity has been .
aroused by our rather unusual mode of
travelins. lam not yet ready to make
my discovery known to the public, but
hope to be able to do so as soon as some
slight changes are made in its construc
tion. Until such time I must refuse to
allow any one to make a close inspection.
You are welcome to get such view of the,
ship as you can from a distance, but any
attempt at closer inspection will meet
with forcible resistance."
The man who had done nearly all the
talking for the party was addressed by his
companions simply as "captain." He
declined to give any information as to
where the ship was constructed or whera
he intended going, saying it was simply
an experimentaln tal trip.

the ropes and carry him to his dressine
room. Fitz tries again to speak but can
not be beard. Leaves the ring, jumping
lightly through the ropes, accompanied by
bis seconds. Walter Watson.
FITZ SAYS FAIRLY
HE WON THE FIGHT.
It was not until after Sharkey had been
carried out of the ring tnat the decision of
the referee was made known to the great
number of people, for Wyatt Earp re
mained only long enough to annoucne his
decision to tnose in and immediately
about the ring. He then with the utmost
speed made his way off the raised plat
form which constituted the ring, out of
the building and beyond the reach of the
crowd.
For a few seconds Fitzsimmons walked
hither and thither like a caged wild beast.
Then he raised his hands above his head
thus indicating that he wished to be
heard.
"The referee ha 3 given the fight to
Sharkey on afoul. It's nothing but a rob
bery," he shouted.
The amazement of that part of the audi
dience close enough to hear him was so
great that for a few seconds there
was silence, then came ahouts of investi
gation.
President J. J. Groom sprang upon the
platform and Julian, the manager of Fitz
simmons, at once protested to him against
tne check being handed over to Sharkey.
Groom explained that the matter was out
of his hands and that the check had un
doubtedly been already paid over to
Sbarkey.
Meanwhile the greater part of the vast
audience were yet unaware that Fitzsim
mons had been declared a vanquished
man. Captain Wittman at this juncture
took it upon himseif to call for o.der, and
tnen for the first time the thousands of
impatient spectators were made aware of
what was the decision of the referee.
Again a howl of indignation, now gen
eral, and much louder went up.
While this was at, its height the lanfc
Cornishman siepped over the ropes and
started to force a passage through the
crowd to his dressing-room in one of the
rooms lacing Larkin street in the upper
floor of the pavilion. He was followed by
hi 3 manager, trainer and seconds. His
progress through the dense mass of peo
ple, jostling one another in their eager
ness to get a view of him, was marked by
shouts of praise and encouragement.
At the door of hiw room the angry pugi
list was met by his wife. Without a word
she pursed up her mouth, and after giving
her husband a hearty kiss she gave vent
to her feelings. "Why, Bob, they are
simply trying to rob you. I saw you
knock him out. Both Mrs. Groom and
myself saw the blow that did it, and it
was no foui," she burst forth. "They
made up their minds to rob you, and they
are trying to do so."
"If I don't get that purse," he an-
swered, "1 will never fight again. It was
a clean knockout." Then turning to
Julian and several other friends who had
followed him to bis room, he continued as
follows:
"Why, they talk about a foul. He
fouled me every time in the breakaway
and several times tried to throw me by
wrpstiing. Oti'-e he tried to throw me over
In* head. I never fought fairer in my lii'e.
If I don't get the pars*) there w;il nÂ»ver be
a fight in San Francisco again. I know
what lam taking about. Tiiis will kill
clove contests. I never struck a cleaner
knockout blow in all my life."
Then taking a posture as if in the ring
he illustrated the manner in which he
had punched his opponent out, explain
ing as he went along. "You â¢cc," he said,
"I feinted with my right for his jaw, then
twang my body toward the left and with
a ieft-hand shift landed square on ins
stomach and lie went down. 1 noticed
ihat when he leil he instinctively placed
hi-, hands over bia stomach, then'quxkly
shifted them to the groin.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 3, 1896.
"Why, I could have knocked him out
long before, but I was afraid to try it un
til I could do it clean. I was not afraid of
him, but of a crooked decision. I pur
posely waited my chance so as to put liim
out good and hard and with a clean blow,
and I I did it. Why, I was
only fooling with him. There wasn't the
slightest need of my fouling him. Iw 11
fight him again right now if they want.
Why, they're simpiy trying to rob us.
The whole plan was fixed up in advance,
and Sharkey was coached just how to act,
in case he got knocked out, so as to eive
the referee an excuse to give him the light
on a foul.
"How could the referee tell in the few
seconds that elapsed between the time
hiiarkey was knocked out Ami the time he
gave his decision that Sharkey was in
jured in the groin? He simply carried
out a prearranged plan to rob us of the
fight. Ho had it fixed to make that state
ment beforehand."
While Fitzsimmons was perspiring free
ly and was flushed he showed no other
traces of the hot eight rounds he had been
through. When he reached his dressing
room he was not even breathing hÂ«rd and
was as fresh, apparently, as when he
stepped over the ropes before. the fight
began. Though Sharkey had lauded on
him repeatedly tnere was not a tell-tale
mark of any kind to be seen on any part
of his body.
SHARKEY STICKS TO
THE FOULING STORY.
Tom Sharkey was conveyed from his
room in the Pavilion to the Windsor Ho
tel on Fifth and Market streets, w; ere he
was soon surrounded by a number of
friends with congratulations, etc.
Doctor B. B. Lee of 400 Geary street fol
lowed Sharkey, his manager, Danny
Needham, and . Billy Smith into a room
fronting on Fifth street, and when the
press representatives asked for admission
they were refused by Lynch, who said
that no one, no matter who it was, could
see Sharkey until the doctor haa exam
ined him.
The newspaper men had to wait until
i Mr. Lynch was ready to accord them an
I invitation.
When the doctor made his escape with
others who left the room the reporters
were allowed to enter the apartment.
Mr. Lynch said that the doctor would
j return in a few minutes, but in the mean
time they could see Sharkey, who was
resting on a bed, apparently suffering.
Sharkey did not have much to say con
cerning the contest. He said that he wa9
struck by Fltzsimmons with a left-hand
hook in the groin, and that be never suf
i fered so much in his life.
"AW lam sorry for," said Sharkey, "is
that the foul blow was delivered in that
round, because I bad Fitzsimmons going
and would surely have whipped him in
the next round. He foaled me frequently
and I thought that the referee would give
the fight against Fitz before the eighth
round."
Sharkey's left eye is cut open half an
inch, and be said tuat that was caused by
a foui blow. A lump the size of a ben's
egg was raised on his cheek bone. His
lips are swollen and cut. In fact his face
resembles that of an old-time fighter who
had just come out of a Londop prize-ring
battle.
His body does not show any signs that
would indicate severe punishment.
While chatting with Sharkey and
Lynch Dr. Lee arrived and the reporters
and others had to vacate the room until
the physician had made an examination of
the figater's injuries. During the ex
amination Sharkey shouted as if in severe
pain. However that may have been,
when the doctor had finished the
examination the reporters were admitted
to see for themselves.
The fighter wjÂ»s bandeged up in the
region of the piace he was .supposed
to have been injured by the alleged foul
blow.
The doctor said that he could not state
positively what the extent ot the pugi
list's injuries are until to-morrow. He
said: "He is unquestionably suffering
from epididemitis, and possibly he may
be in a bad state by morning. He has a
| b:id eyo and I must sew that up immedi-
I atelv."
REFEREE EARP
EXPLAINS HIS RULING.
Referee Earp put in an appearance os
tensibly to see how Siiarkey was. When
asked how the aueged foul blow was de
livered, he said :
"When Sharkey ducked to avoid a
right-hand cross Fitzsirumons stooped
down as low as he could and hooke i him
with the left in the groin. Tom reeled
over, ami I immediately gave tiie fijrht
against Fitzsimmoii3, as I considered it a
Bto*t palpable foul.
"Now, I don't know this man Sharkey.
I have not seen him until ihis evening.
I was introduced to Fnzsimruons a few
years asro by a most particular friend of
mme â Bat Masterson of Denver â and I
am sure Masterson lost considerable
money on the result, but I cannot help
that.
,'l had to decide the contest to the best
of my ability, and to tell you the truth, I
came very near disqualifying Fitzsim
mons when he cut open Sharkey's eye by
having first missed him with the lelt and
then drawinc back his arm quickly. By
[ this means he drove the point of his elbow
across Sharkey's eye, cutting a deep gash
on his eyebrow."
When Mr. Earp was asked what he
thought of the tactics of Sharkey when
be frequently grabbed Fitzsimmons by the
legs and attempted to throw him on his
back, he said that those fouls were not
ntentional and that Sharkey did not
mean anything wrong by them.
"I do not notice any unintentional fouls,"
said Earp, "but of the two men Fitzsim
mons certainly committed the most palp
able fouls and that is why I decided in
favor of Sharkey. Any person with halt
an eye can see that Sharkey is a sick man
and that he was struck foul."
JULIAN SPEAKS
HIS MIND FREELY.
Julian was in a fierce beat of rage and
exhibited even more feeling over the de
cis on of the referee th^n his principal.
"If we don't get that purse," he exclaimed
after he had entered Fitzsimmons' room.
"I will lick every man in the club. I
won't be robbed like this." Then address-
Martin JuliaivFitzsimmons' Second
ing himself to the representative of The'
Call he said :
"I will just tell you the whole thing.
We were not to win this fight. That is all
there is to it. We came here determined
to sifcn the articles of agreement without
making any unnecessary objections and
to avoid anythiiig like a disturbance, so
we agreed to every point.
"The question came up in making out
the articles of agreement in reference to a
referee and it was agreed that if we could
not decide upon one between ourselves the
club would select one. We were unable to
agree and so the matter was left to the
club. Eight nnmes were submitted, any
of which would have suited us, but the
other si.le objected to all of them, not*
withstanding the fact that among them
was 'he name of Hiram Cook, the man
Sharkey insisted on having as referee in
his tight with Corbett.
"Such men as Mose Gimst, Tom James
ani Eddie Greaney and a half dozen
others came to us before the fight and to^d
us positively that the match was fixed,
that tlieyretereeivas bought and that Fitz
siinmolfs could not win under any circum
stances."
At ihis point J. J. Groom, president of
the National Athletic Club, entered the
room and Julian at once turned to aim and
thus adressed him:
'â Mr. Groom, as president of the Na
tional Athletic Club, I warn you not to
pay Mr. SSiarkey thai purse, because \l is
a robbery and a bilk and I won' t
Btami it. I tell" you to-night that this
reteree was b â¢ught. 1 '
To this Mi. Groom nodded in the
affirmative. _
Juiian then continued: "Mr. Groom
himself had to yell to Earp half a dozen
times to c;ill his attention to fouls. Ain't
that o, Mr. Groom?"
And again the latter answered by an
affirmative nod.
Juiian then applied an epithet not fit
for publication to Earp ani continued:
"1 knew it before I went into the fight,
but I was forced into accepting him as the
referee. lam told by responsible people
that he was fixed by racetrack
people. They call him Bloody
Earp and say he is a dangerous man, but
I will tell him to his face what 1 think of
him and punch the stomach out of him.
I ought to have knocked the stuffing out
of him right there in the ring. I don't
know why I didn't.".
HOW THINGS
WERE ARRANGED.
The National Club came in for a good
share of praise last evenint; because of the
very excellent preparations it had made
for tbe comfort of the thousands of people
wiio assembled in the Mechanics' Pavilion
to witness the great heavy-weight battle.
The ring was the regulation size â twen
ty-four feet â and was situated exactly in
the center of the'big hall. It was raised to
an elevation of three feet from tbe floor,
and as a precaution against snv possible
injury to the contestants the floor was
padded and the ring posts were also
padded.
Box seats to the number of 150, each
containing eight chairs, surrounded the
ring. On the outside Of the boxes the $5
chairs, to the number of several hundred,
were situated in such a manner on raised
platforms that the occupants could easily
see every point in the content.
Then the regular bench seats on each
side of the pavilion were occupied; in fact,
men were sandwiched in together like
sardines in a box.
Besides the thousands of people who
gathered in the gallery, which was not re
served for anybody, the rule being first
come first served, there were special seats
which were sold at $3 each to people, who
pladly availed of an opportunity of seeing
the mill from an elevated point immedi
ately over the ring.
A huge streamer bearing the National
colors was streeched V-shape over the
tattle ground.
The pugilistic time clock, which has
done much service in ticking off the sec
onds in the old California Athletic Club's
apartment on New Montgomery street
when finish contests' were tolerated,
looked down upon the roped square from
a point on the northwest side of the hall
immediately fronting the reporters' de
partment. ,
Around the clock was a box, in which
sat the time-keepers for the club and tbe
contestants. The old chronometer re
minded many members of the old
California Club of the good old
fighting days of tbe pant. It was the in
strument that ticked oft the seconds and
minutes of that memorable battle between
James J. Cornctt and Pefer Jacttson.
On the south end of the Pavilion was a
compartment specially set apart for a
band of thirty pieces. The music pleaded
tbe boys because it was made np of the
very latest catchy airs, such Â»s 'Sweet
Rosie O'Grady," "I Want Yer, Ma
Honey," "Tom Sharkey's March From
the Philadelphia," etc.
With the exception of the $10 reserved
seats, ali other parts of the liouse were
crowded as crowded could be. When the
big fight came on the hiph-toned boxes
were all occupied.
THEY STRUGGLED
FOR ENTRANCE.
Scarcely had darkness begun to settle
when eacrer men began to struggle about
the entrance to the Pavilion for tbe pur
pose of securing advantageous seats.
When tbe ticket-offices and doors were
flu ally thrown open the men were lined
up two abreast from the main entrance,
both toward Grove street and toward
Hayes street, and a corps of at least two
score police officers, were kept, hustling to
keep them in order.
Within fifteen minutes after the sale of
tickets began at tbe box-office the an
nouncement was made thai all the $2
seats were sold, and that only $5 and $10
tickets were to be had.
Tbe galleries were the first to fill. TheÂ«e
were soon well crowded, while thb box
[ seats on the main floor were not occupied
to any great extent until shortly before
the big event came off.
Quite a number of daring spectators,
who were unprovided with reserved seats,
clambered upon the rafters of the roof,
but were counseled to descend from their
perch by the commands of the police.
THERE WERE BIG
CROWDS OUTSIDE.
The handling of the crowd on the out
side of the Pavilion under the immediate
supervision of Chief Crowley and Captain
Wittman was as perfect as it was possible
to have it.
Those holding tickets were formed into
line on the north side of the main en
trance while those wno came to purchase
their pasteboards were lormed on tbe
south side, thus dividing those who
wished to enter into two separate lines
In this way there was no confusion and
the tremendous crowd entered with dis
patch.
One hundred police officers in citizen's
clothes with their star* pinned on the
lapels of their coats were under the com
mand of Sergeants Blank and Cook, who
with four mounted officers keep the oide
walK and street in front of the entrance
clear.
.When the greater portion of those hold
ing tickets had entered Chief Crowley re
tired to his office and donned citizen's
clothes and escorted Police Commissioner
Tobin.into the building.
At no time during the evening from 7 :30
o'clock until the result of the f>eht was
announced were there less than 5000 per
sons on Larkin street in front of the en
trance.
THE PURSE MAY
BE WITHHELD.
In an interview with President Groom
he stated the club would do all in its
power to do justice to every one. He said
that the check was certified and it would
be difficult to stop the payment of it.
"We will take medical advice as to
Sharkey's injuries, and also legal advice
as to what can be done to withhold the
payment of t c check by the bank. If
we can keep the bank from payintr it we
will investigate the wnole matter and try
to do what is right and just."
i There is to be a meeting between Presi
dent Groom and Manager Julian in refer
ence to the mntter this morning.
President Groom stated that so far as
be could see and judge Sharkey wast fairly
knocked out.

m "" v)iHÂ» CO., 22800, Eighth St., F-IUcU., fa,in my life. Sharkey did all the fouling
that was done. The Cornishman is the
one who deserved the decision. It was a
clean, fair knockout and shows that Bob
can hit harder than any man that has ever
faced Sharkey. â â *â¢â¢*
Coroner Hawkinsâ Fitzsimraons cer
tainly deserved the decision. He knocked
Sharkey out as fairly as any man was ever
yet knocked out. Earp is deserving not
only of severe censure, but of the detesta
tion of every man believing in honest
sport.
Jimmy Carrollâ Don't ask me about the
decision. I don't care to speak of it. I
will say, however, that the referee should
not have made bis decision t>ll he had
called for a surgical examination of
Sharkey. Though I believe Fitz the
greatest fighter in the rine;, I won a bar
rel of money on the fight.
Young Mitchellâ lt was tbe rankest
'decision I ever heard of in my life. It
was the biggest steal on earth. I cannot
find words strong enough to express my
indignation. Fitz simply gave Sharkey
ajeft hook in the pit of the stomach that
doubled him up, and then followed it
witti a left hook in the jaw that finished
â¢him. J3ob Jd the greatest fighter in the
world.
Sharkey is nowhere alongside him.
This decision will kill legitimate boxing
in this City. The referee should be driven
off the face. of the earth. He ought to
.hide his face from all decent men.
Billy Daly â Sbarkey's position was such
that to foul him by hitting him where it
was claimed he was cannot be considered
at all. This decision, following in the
wake of Maher's coming here and failing
. to get a contest, will kill boxing in San
Francisco. It was the clearest case of rob
bery on earth.
Tom Jamesâ l am giad lam leaving San
Francisco shortly. This is the best I can
â¢say for a city that would permit a man to
be robbed of his money as Bob Fitzsim
mons was.
SOMETHING ABOUT
THE TWO MEN.
Sext to the excitement that attended the
late Presidential election nothing has
transpired in this great land of the Golden
:-V/est: -V/est which has attracted wider attention
than the prizefight that took place last
evening in- Mechanics' Pavilion under the
auspices of the National Athletic Club of
California. â 
The principals are well known to sport
ing -people of. this country.
Bob Fitzsimmons, the one-time "crack
ajack" blacKsniith of New Zealand, out
now the acknowledged heavy and middle
weieht champion pugilist of the world,
met in a passage-at-arms the doughty and
husky sailor lad, Thomas Sharkey, who
holds the- undisputed title of champion
. pugilist of the American navy.
Little it was thought a year or so ago
that the sailor lad who polished off in easy
fashion such men as Billy Smith, Alex
Greggains, big Miller of the San Francisco
Athletic Club, Tom Wiliams of Salt Lake
and Tom Johnson would within twelve
months face such famous fistic gladiators
as Jim Corbett, Joe Choynski and Bob
Fitzsimmons.
But the sailor was ambitious, and he
consequently forsed to the front in a sur
prisingly fast manner. In fact, Sharkey
â nas been continually "on the train ever
since the time he bid larewell to his brother
tars of the cruiser Philadelphia, and it was j
no wonder then that the thousands of
iM>ort-ioveri who gathered in the Pavilion
last evening looked at Thomas in amaze
ment and pronounced him to be "as tine
as a fiddle and as hard as nails."
In fact, Sharkey looked iike a man who
had overdone the thing.
&In the language of the trainers of ath
letes, "the sailor was down too fine and
wore the appearance of an overtrained
athlete."
But Sharkey thought differently, and
â 
Danny NeedhanifSharkey's Second
his, handlers avowed that a man of
grander lorm and more perfect condition
. never entered a prize ring to do battle.
Fitzsimmotts, the loose-joinied and pow
erful-backed hero of many hard fistic
arguments, looked just right for a spank
ing mill of eight or ten rounds duration.
He. did not carry any weight in flesh that
would in the least bit hamper his chances
of victory, yet he could have conveniently
taken off ten or twelve pounds of the
weight he carried into the ring last even
ing and felt like a fighting cock for a
long- distance race.
Fitzsimmons, when asked at his train
ing quarters at Sausalito, if he ever in
tended to fight in the middle-weight class
again and M he could eet within the limit
weight if the opportunity offered, an
swered in the "affirmative without a sec
ond's hesitation. Fitz entered the rine
last night weighing 172 pounds, and ac
cording to Bharkey's trainees, the tailor
scaled 175 pounds. The following are iheir
latest measurements:
Fiizsimmonsâ Height, 5 feet UJjJ Inches
weight, 172 pounds; nerk, 17% inchÂ«t>; chest,
44 Inches; biceps, 14}^ inches; . forenrm, 12
inches; wrist, 8^ ineiies; waist, 33 inches
thigh, 23 inches; calf, 14 inches; ankle, Bli
inches.
Stiarkeyâ Height, 5 feet %y 2 inches; weieht,
172, pounds; neck, 18 incnes; chPRt, 45 in
ches; biceps, 15 inches; forearm, 13}Â£ inches
waist, 32 inches; thieh, 22 inches ; calf, 17V
inches; ankle, 9 inches; wrist, 7?Â£ inches. I
It will be seen, therefore, that Fitzsim
mons had creat advantage over bis stocky
opponent in height and reach of arms,
and it was the latter that stood him well,
as he frequently reached h;s opponent at
a distance that not only surprised the
Bailor, but his crafty attendants.
According. to Fitzsimmons' record, the
battles he has fought were short in com
parison to the battles in which Peter Jack
son, Jim Corbett and other noted heavy- I
weights figured. The Cornishman, strange
to say, invariably won his battles by "the
skin of his teeth." In other words, Fitz,
when apparently done up, would recoyer
just in time to give a surprise, not only to
his opponent, but to those who looked for
his deieat momentarily. Whether Robert
was scheming hard to gain a point or was
pjsse^sed of extraordinary recuperative
power*, history does not state. At any
rate the bg Cornishman would suddenly
reccyer at a most opportune moment and
turn the tables on his opponent by plant
ing >ibii right "duke" on tbatvulner
al ointâ the jawâ which landed him a
k wi
1 1 ;Â«08e interested in pugilistic affair* are
aware of the many meetings Fitzsimmons
and Corbett have had with the object of
cn tf aging in a contest to a finish. In fact
tliey are at it yet and, according to the
pre-ent outlook, the big guns in pugilism
are as far away now from- the Consumma
tion of a match as they were a year ago
when Fitzsimmons challenged Corbett to
Record ot Tom Sharkey.
Tom Sharkey was born in Dim Dolk, Ireland, 1572; height, 5 feet 9% inches. His first
fight was with Nick Burley, whom he defeated in eight rounds, at Honolulu; defeated Joe
Langley in iour rounds at Honolulu; defeated K. Thompson in two rounds in 1893; de
feated J. Picket in four rounds at Honolulu in 1893; defeated M. Mulverhill in nine
rounds at Vallejo in 1894; defeated in three rounds J. Gardner, who was champion of the
English navy, and held it four years. (Gardner boxed a ten-round draw with Ted Prichard
before the National Athletic Club. The latter was then the champion middle-weight of
England.) Defeated Billy Smith in seveu rounds; defeated John Miller in nine rounds;
defeated Dunn in Vallejo in one and a half rounds; draw with Alex Grcggalns; stayed
. eight rounds with Joe Choynski; four-round draw with James J. Corbett.
meet him in a contest to a finisn for the
championship of the world. The only
possible chance of a settlement now rests
in the hands of Dan Stuart, who has re
cently announced that if both of the men
are really anxious to fight he will guaran
tee them a good purse and a meeting that
will not be interfered with by the authori
ties. Fitzsimmons agreed to Stuart's
proposition and it Corbett will give his
consent the great battle will be decided on
Texas soil some time in February next.
The betting on last night's fight was
very lively. Of course. Fitzsimmons was
purchased by thousands of people at odds
of 2 to 1 that be would get the decision.
Several wagers were also laid on the
rounds. Several thousand dollars went
into tbe poolboxes at even money that
| Fiizsimmons would whip Sharkey in six
\ rounds or less. Some bets were made that
the light would not last two rounds. It
was said that in Corbett's poolrooms over
$100,000 changed hands on the result.
Â«,
OFFICIAL PROTEST
TO BE FILED.
When Fitzsimmons returned to the
hotel the crowd awaiting him was so
great that all but guests were kept out by
the police. Bob and Julian forced their
way to the elevator, where, before ascend
ing to their rooms, Julian addressed the
crowd and said:
"Gentlemen, you see Hob here. He
doesn't look like a man that needed to
foul Sharkey to win, does he?"
Here the crowd set up an uproarious
cheering for FitzsimmonÂ«, with cries of,
"You're the greatest tighter on earth,
Bob," and "Sharkey wasn't in it."
After the two men reached their rooms
they were joined by Attorney Henry
Kowalsky, Major "McLaughlin, oharle3
Paxton and several others. An active dis
cussion was then had with regard to
stopping the payment of the check to
Sharkey.
It was finally decided to make a protest
to the club at once. Fitzsimmons then
went downstairs to the lobby, where he
was simply overwhelmed with congratu
lations. Earp and his decision were uni
versally execrated.
LON AGNEW
DEFEATS MULLER.
At 9:30 p. m. Fred Muller of the San
Francisco Athletic Ciub and Lon Agnew
of Chicago â light weights at 135 pounds
entered the ring with their respective
attendants for a ten-round contest.
The betting was in favor of Aenew.
The referee selected was Frank Allen.
First roundâ Muller was first to lead with a
left on Agnew's nose. He fought fast and had
all the best of it up to near the finish, when
Agnew got in one or two hard punches on
stomach and face. Muller looked a bit tired.
Second roundâ Agnew was boilnc: very coolly
and apparently waiting for Muller to tire him
self out. Muller kept punching his man with
rights and lefts and Agnew either feigned grog
giness or was too tired to hit. Mv ler scored a
strong lead just before the bell sounded.
Referee Wyatt Earp.
Third roundâ Agnew came up fresh, bat
stopped some heavy rights with his chin. Ag
new missed several left swings. The contest
was at this juncture spirited. Agnew relied
entirely on hooki and swings to knock his
man out, but Muller was administering the
most punishment and putting up a great fieht.
Both men were tired.
Fourth roundâ Agnew was the aggressor.
He kept constantly after Muller, a:id took
blows that knocked his heed back, out tney
did not seem to have force. It was a good
jflve and tÂ«ke round, with Muller scoriDg the
most blows.
Fifth roundâ Muller dashed at Agnew and
hit him with a right in the nose and Agnew
retaliated by landing on Muller's ribs
Agupw now fought wickedly and landed a
right on Muller's chin which brought
the receiver to his knees. Muller
was up inside of the ten seconds
and fought gamely, but was sent down ag.iin.
Four times Muller was knocked down, but he
got up gamely and met his man, oniy to receive
greater punishment. He was knocked down
and was on nis back when the gong sounded
the end of the round.
Sixth roundâ Muller toed the scratch in a
groggy slate and dashed at Agnew, who
Miopped the blow neatly. Then Lon dashed at
his quarry und gave the game Muller
a fearful thumping for a few sec
onde, when Muller was scut sprawling
against the ropes and gradually his legs gave
way until his oody dropped limp on the rt-
Miied floor in the northwest corner of the ring.
He remained down until counted out, but all

THEY CHOSE
WYATT EARP.
It was exactly as The Call published
| yesterday. Martin Julian and Danny
| Lynch met to discuss as to the referee for
thejfight and they disagreed.
Julian presented a list of seven men, any
one of whom would be acceptable. They
I were Hiram Cook, Lem Fulda, both ex
presidents of the old California Athletic
Club; Eddie Graney, who has been Jos
| Choynski's friend and backer since the
| Mission lad first quit his candy manufac
j turing bench for the ring; Bob McArthur,
the Olympic Club athlete; Al Herford
and finally Billy Jordan, tho old reliable
mnster of ceremonies.
The Sharkey faction would hava noth
ing to do with any of these men.
Danny Lynch, representing the sailor
I lad, had few names to present. Lynch,
who is a horseman when he is not man
aging tights, naturally picked out a turf
man as his first choice for referee. Danny
Miller, the game little plunger whose
name stands ace high among sporting
j men, was offered a* referee. Miller is now
i the holder of the $5000 forfeit money put
Gentlemen, please fif rain from
smoking," said Mr. Jordan,
Master of Ceremonies*
up by Corbett and Sharkey for their pros
pective fight to a finish.
The other names furnished by Lynch
were those of John and James Quinn,
neither of whom is known very much in
the sporting world.
Lynch was just as contrary as was
Julian when they met at 11 o clock yes
terday morning to decide upon a choice.
Neither man could give a truly valid rea
son for rej-cting the choice of the other;
still, the simple proposition that Julian
proposed any one or that Lynch preferred
another was sufficient for a disagreement
on either side.
Manager Gibbs came to the front at thi*
juncture, backed by the article of agree
ment signed by the principals. These
allowed the National Athletic Club to aot
as arbitrator in the event of a disagree
ment.
Gibbs presented tho name of \\ yatt
Earp as referee, and he was immediately
accepted as a good middle-of-the-road
candidate.
Little needs to be said about Wyatt
Earp's ability to referee any kind of a
light.
He is essentially the man for an engage
ment in which a man like Sharkey is a
principal. His career as an officer of the
law and a fugitive irom lawless cowboys
with whom he and his brothers fought
hand-to-hand for the benefit ot order, has
proved him to be a man of unquestioned
nerve, and one who cannot be made to
back water. Two of his brothers have
been shot to death, and he has also been
punctured by bullets.
During the past few years Earp has
divided his time between dealing faro
bank in San Diego and an interest in run
ning or trotting horses on different tracks
of this State. He is now an employe of
the Examiner, for which paper he has
written several clever articles about fron
tier lite. He is the bete noir of Dave
Neagle, who killed the late Judge Terry,
and about whom that paper published
many caustic articles.
Atone time it was understood that Earp
ordered Neagle te leave town, Tucson or
San Francisco, whenever he (Earp) was
around, and the supposition arises that
Neagle will hesitate to go around a news
paper office where Wyatt Earp is.
Such a man was considered not one to
bo intimidated by either fighter nor by
public clamor. As a consequence his
choice by the National Athletic Club met
with general approval.

SUICIDE OF AN ACTOR.
Harry Thompson Shuffles Off
the Mortal Coil While
Despondent.
H) Takes a Dose of Poison at Duan's
Vila on the o:can Beach and
Makes His Exit.
Harry Thompson, actor and playwright,
committed suicide yesterday, and all that
is known of his motive is told in a post
scriptum of a letter he left behind: "I
didn't mean it, sir; indeed I didn't."
Those who know him best believe he
was despondent, and that he gave way un
der reverses of fortune. He had a wife,
who, if we may judge from his letters,
loved him dearly and struggled hard in
Philadelphia to support herself by teach
ing mu-sic, but with poor success, She
was beginning only, and looked to her
husband for assistance, which he could
not give.
Thompson came here from the East
with the "In Darkest Russia" company,
which played at the California, but he did
not make a success in San Frantisco. His
manager, Sidney R. Ellis, left him a
note advising him to see Dr. Henry
H. Hart, physician of the Actors'
Fund, and telling him he conld
not loan more money. On Novem
ber 13 Thompson received a letter from his
wife from Philadelphia, in which she ex
pressed sincere borrow on hearing of his
illness, and also a wish that the note would
find him in good spirits and health.
She told him she was teaching music
and had progressed so far as to be able to
earn $2 a week, but had hopes of better
times.
Illness and failure had their effect upon
the actor, who came to the conclusion
it was not "better in the mind to suffer,"
etc. He took two drinks and ended the
"siugs and arrows." And he left this
letter behind to tell his story.
Thk Baldwin,
San Francisco, Cai., Monday, 189 .
When a man is on the eve of eternity he
thinks through many funny strawsâ my case;
but to be brlei. The sun has ret, and as she
or it sinks 1 look at it in wonder and amaze
ment and think how beautiful you were at the
rise, how dismal and black at the setting;
however, go down, dear sun, and rise to smile
upon my ruin, still some ruins are grand and
neautiful to look upon, nothing nore. Some
kind soul will look upon my ruin, and to use
the language of "a iriemi," will start at be
holding me, thinking me dead, little dreaming
that "tiie moaning aud groaning, tne sighing
and sobblog are quieted now."
Some don't think f have not had a good time
in this rough old world of ours, for IJiave, I
die a true bobemiau, I have burnt the "can
dle" at both ends and wish to go to sleep, that
is all, so please, Mr. Coroner don't cut mo
deep one last favor, in my fob-pocket will be
found a quarter please buy a "white rose." I
would lite my dear friend Charley Brooks to
do this andj>ut it with me in my cozy little
room before you lock the door. lam afraid
this horrible heart-throbbing will interfere,
but I hope to reach the spot, of course these
things are too bad but they will occur, to the
"boys" who come to look upon me all I ask is
speak of me as you found me.
Harry Thompson.
I didn't meau it sir indeed I didn't.
Monday ni<*ht Thompson asked for a
room at the Rusb House. He appeared to
the manager as a respectable fellow and
was given accommodation, and that night
he wrote his farewell. Next evening he
went to Dunn's Villa at the Ocean beach.
He engaged a room and paid for it, and
after takinc two drinks at the bar, made
the casual remark, "I'm- tired, and I'm
going to ted."
Yesterday evening, Gus Raetz, an em
ploye of the villa, found Thompson dead
in bed. Thompson was taken to the
Morgue, where an autopsy will be held to
ascertain the cause of death, which is sup
posed to be poison.
Thompson was an author of mediocre
plays, one of which is a "Mystery of
Venice," but he never reached any emi
nence on the stage.

POOLROOM MEN
GET A SETBACK
Judge Joachimsen Decides
to Uphold the Ordi
nance.
The Contention of Prosecuting
Attorney Dare Sus
tained.
Selling of a Pool Ticket Held to Be
Sufficient Evidence of a Viola
tion of tbe Law.
Judge Joachimsen has differed from the
three other Police Judges in their inter
pretation of the pooiselling ordinance and
yesterday gave a decision which will put a
stop to the persistent violations of the law
by the proprietors of poolrooms.
When the case of George T. Tuttle, 20
Leidesdorff street, who was arrested for
violating the ordinance, came on for hear
idg before the Judge some days ago, Pros
ecuting Attorney Dare contended that it
did not matter whether or not the pool
sellers sent the money to the race track to
be wagered. All that they had to consider
was whether or not the defendant sold a
pool ticket to Policeman Francis, the
complaining witness, and they had the
officer's testimony and the ticket itself as
evidence of that fact.
He quoted in support of his contention
subdivision 2 of section 1 of the ordinance,
which reads as follows:
No person upon any trial or contest of skill,
speed or power of endurance between horses,
except within the inclosure of a racetrack
where such trial or contest is to take place,
shall sell, issue or dispose of any ticket, cer

Counsel for the defendant argued that
the defendant was simply acting as a com
mission agent and by sending the money
to the track the meaning and intent of
the ordinance was not violated.
The Judge referred to the fact that three
other Judges had dismissed pll the cases
that came before them on the ground, he
supposed, that the poolsellers were com
mission men, but he said he would take
time to consider the matter.
Monday the Judge convicted Tuttle and
ordered him to appear for sentence yester
day. In passing sentence the Judge said:
In the absence of your attorney, Mr. Tuttle,
I will consider a motion for a new trial as hav
ing been made on nil statutory grounds and
such other grounds as he sees fit to make; that
such motion is submitted and denied and ex
ception taken.
Also I will consider that he has made a
motion in arrest of judgment upon such
grounds as he may see fit to name; that such
motion is submitted and denied and exception
taken.
In Imposing sentence in this case the diffi

â â¢.-.."â¢CHIBPEWA FALLS, Wis., Dec. 2.-
This has" been "moving day" in Chippewa
.Falls and along the Chippewa 'Valley
d.own to tne Mississippi. The lower streets
Vof the cijy are alive and noisy with mov
" :f: f jng wagon's of all descriptions, of drays,
,Â«awdusfbarts, farm wagons aud delivery
outfits. Everything that can be drafted
into service has been set at work and the
merchants of Spring street are rapidly
getting back to places of safety.
At midnight the water forced back from
the Chippewa ice-gorge was creeping up
the streets toward the Wisconsin Central
station. This morning at 8 o'clock the
water wae three feet above the tracks. An
hour later the tracks were abandoned.
-The water has been steadily rising all day.
For several blocks further back hoteis
and business houses were chilly, the water
havinc extinguished all rires.
For ten miles below the Chippewa the
river is tilled with ice, gorged well to the
bottom, obstructing the flow. Below the
gorge to Eau Claire the water is receding
wtiiie reports from above the dam indicate
that the water on the upper Chippewa,
Flambeau and other streams will soon go
down.
There is a complete cessation of business
here and hundreds have been to great in-
convenience and loss â that is all as yet.
But the shadow of a great calamity lies
over Chippewa Valley. It is of record that
fifty years ago an ice gorge formed near
here and that when it went out in the
spring it swept the vally clean to the Mis
sissippi. There were no houses then, but
great trees were cut off, the banks swept
clean and devastation followed.
Eau Claire might be swept out of ex
istence by such a flood and the loss would
be incalculable and terrible. All this is
possible, perhaps probable. If the weather
should moiterate now or should the force
of the backwater become so ereat as to
break- the jam of ice and logs, packed
almost inextricably between this city and
Eau Claire, the calamity would come
now. With the mercury at zero the suf
fering from the flood would be beyond the
power of imagination. Vast quantities of
water flow over the dam at the upper end
Of the city, bringing down ice in large
quantities. Below the rapids at the dam
this water flows under the ice pack for
miles, shoving against bridges and back
ing into the town.
The'water is tWenty-five feet above the
low mark. In 1884 it was twenty-eight
feet above, but that was a summer flood
without obstruction. The wagon bridge [
across the river to the south 'of the towns
seems almost imperceptibly in motion and
may be. moved dangerously soon. Even
now its south approach is trembling. Be
low it is the Wisconsin Central bridge, as
yet Safe. The entire pack above the solid
gor^e has moved 1000 feet in the last
twenty-four hours and attempts are being
made to open a passage through it with
dynamite. Owing to the fact that no high
gorge is apparent, the river being packed
for miles, the project can scarcely be suc
cessful.
It may be said there is no danger to life
here, nor will there be. The city is in
darkness to-night, the gas plant having
long ago been abandoned.
The Wisconsin Central roped in its de
pot buildings to hold them. Late reports
from Little Falls, where the Weyerhausers
have tne biggest dam on the Chippewa,
are that the dam there is likely to hold.
If it should be opened, probably great de
struction would result there.
DURAND, Wis., Dec. 2.â The situation
on the bottoms remains unabated. The
terrible water and ice flood extend over
raites in area in the low country and the
damage to livestock und hay and grain
aggregate thousands of dollars. One or
two men refused rescue and no word has
since been heard from them. About thirty
people who were brought here are being
taken care of in the county building. At
this place the water is in every street and
basements and people are moving out.
The railway track is damaged aud washed
out for several miles between here and
Wabash.
Should the dam above Eau Claire break
there is no telling the danger and damage
that will ensue to Durand and vicinity.
It is impossible for trains to move more
than, six miles below here. Stages west to
Arkansas aud Eau Falls are abandoned
and the wire 3to these points are down.
Business is practically at a standstill.
People residing on the west shore are liv
in second stories.
CHICAGO, 111., Dec. 2.â Passengers
who came to Chicago to-day from Chip
pewa Valley stations assured all anxious
enquirers that though there was still the
gravest danger of Chippewa Falls being
destroyed by the flood there was no longer
any fear for Eau Claire. The flood suf
ferers along the Chippewa River are pray
ing for warmer weather as much as for a
subsiding of the waters. The thermome
ter at the Wisconsin Central station at
Chippewa Falls at midnight registered ten
degrees below zero.
A rise in the temperaiure would allevi
ate the sufferings of the homeless as well
as melt the ice and allow ttie river to sub
side to its ordinary channel in the terri
tory between the fall? and Irvine station.
The Northwestern, St. Paul and Wiscon
sin railways have resumed the running of
trains toChippewa and the postoffice has
been moved from the business portion of
the town seven blocks away on the hill.
When the limited on the Wisconsin Cen
tral arrived hera to-day half an hour late
on account of time lost between Chippewa
and Eau Claire there were many people at
the depot to learn of the conditions pre
vailing in the stricken region from the
trainmen and passengers. The train was
at Chippewa at 11 p. m. and the water was
then over the platform of the depot. The
people ware filled with fear that the worst
would tfgfall the town, business was sus
pended and there was a general exodus to
the hills north ol the town. â¢
Purely Commercial Enterprise
NEW YORK, K. V., Dec.i-Tha Pacific
THAT FUNDING BILL WILL NOT DOWN.
NEW YORK N. Y. Dec. 2. A Tribune special from Washington says: Despite
the bitter opposition to thePacitic Railroad funding hill, especially on the part of
the Western and Southern men in Congress, a strong effort will be made to pass
the measure at the coming session of that body. At the last session large majori
ties ol both the Senate and House committees agreed upon the substantial provis
ions of a bill to refund the indebtedness to the Government.
The subject has been before Congress in one form or another for about thirty
years. In 1878 the bill prepared by Senator Thurman passed and became a law.
At that time it was generally believed that the law would yield sufficient revenue 1
for the sinking fund to extinguish the debt at the end of the prescribed period.
This belief has been disappointing. Within the last two years the United States,
in addition to the millions it has been compelled to pay as interest on the first
mortgage bonds (which, under a decision of the Supreme Court, are a second lien
on the properties of the companies), Has paid about $16,000,000 on the principal.
Next year the Government will have to pay about $30,000,000 of principal, if Con
gress does not pass any refunding bill before January 30, 1897.
Company, with a capital of $20,000,000,
owned â¢by some of the most substantial
men and financiers of this city, has been
formed for the purpose of bringing the
Latin- American countries into closer busi
ness relation wiLh the United States. The
undertaking is a purely commercial enter
prise, the new company planning to do a
shipping and general mercantile business
on the Pacihc Coast, and develop mines
and other property in tbe Southern Hem
ispnere. The officers are: Henry Keene,
president; R. W. Hawkswortii, secretary;
Jacob Bertschinann, treasurer. None of
the company's stock is for sale.
FOUR CHILDREN SMOTHERED.
Their Mother Had Them Locked in the
House and They Perished Before
Assistance Arrived.
CHICAGO, 111., Dec. 2.â Four children
locked in a house at 1716 Thirty-third ave
nue were smothered to death during a fire
in a.pile of clothing in a room where they
were playing. Mrs. Mary Barth left the
house at 10:30 o'clock to fco to the Chicago,
Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway yards to
pick coal, locking the door behind her.
The childrenâ Joseph, six years; Rosie,
four years; Jotin, two years, and Louis,
one year of age â were playing in thediniug
room. During the absence of the mother
they secured v box of matches, and it is
supposed ignited the clothing in their
play. The curtains over the only window
in the rooai were burned and the case
ments wore scorched.
The distracted mother returned two
hours later to find the house filled with
smoke. The heap of burned clothing was
still smoldering, and the bodies of the
little ones were lyinc on the floor. An
empty bucket was near by, indicating that
an attempt had been made to extinguish
the blaze. Unable to open doors or win
dows, and having exhausted tne supply
of water in the house, the four children
were overcome in the dense smoke that
filled the whole house and were dead be
fore assistance came. John Bartb, the
father, is a teamster, and had left homo
to attend his work early this morning.
ALCOHOL IN THE ARTS.
Many Reasons Why the Duty Should Be
Removed on Spirits Used in Manu
factures.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 2.â The
joint .Congressional committee to-day re
sumed the taking of testimony of those
interested in the proposed measure to
abolish the internal revenue tax on alco
hol used in the arts and manufactures.
E. N. Stevens of the Manhattan Spirit
Company, Buffalo, the first witness, disa
greed with the testimony of Dr. Weild
ing given yesteiday that wood and grain
alcohol could not be demethylated. He
clared that by a simple process a mixture
of arrain and wood alcohol could be de
rnetiiylated. He then stated that the
handling and manufacture of wood alco
hol were injurious to workmen. Mr.
Stevens argued that to remove the tax on
grain alcohol would be to ruin the wood
alcohol business.
C. E. Merritt, a large hat manufacturer
otDanfcury, Conn., followed Mr. Stevens.
He said that the experience of the hatters
had been tLat wood alcohol injured the
eyes and health of the employes. There
could be no doubt, Mr. Merritt said, but
that grain alcohol was much better for
their purposes than wood alconol.ibut its
tax made its use out of the question.
Dr. Oley of Danbury said he had
treated the hatters of that city, and was
an occnlist of ability, told of the injuries
resulting from wood alcohol to the eyes
and other organs. Similar testimony was
given by others.
George D. Bauer, representing the firm
of J. C.Ayer & Co. ol Lowell, Mass., read
j a lengthypaper in favor of the abolish
ment of the tax. His firm, ne said, manu
factured five proprietary medicines. They
were able to furnish these medicines to
European and Scuth American druggists
cheaper than to American dealers.
This, Mr. Bauer explained, was accom
plished by purchasing alcohol made in
Germany from potatoes. This was brought
in under bond and made up in the pro
prietary medicines for export only. The
law on alcohol in this country prevented
the medicines irom being sold cheap and
within the reach of the poor. Mr. Bauer
thought the Government could easily be
protected irom all fraud by a rebate sys
tem.
A. Strindison of Detroit, Mich., repre
senting the various Michigan manufac
turers, the next witness, opposed the re
moval of the tax. To do so, he said,
would injure the various Michigan roanu
lacturers. The witness asserted that it
would kill the oil varnish industry in the
United States. Frank S. Clark of Wil
mington, N. C, next tcok the stand. He
declared that if the tax on the grain prod
uct were removed it would simply ruin all
the wood alcohol manufacturers in the
conutry.
GRACE KIMBALL MISQUOTED.
Site Did Xnt Say That the American Hag
is Aot Jiespected in Turkey.
NEW YORK, N. V.. Dec. 2.â A special
from Poughkeepsie, N. V., says: In an
interview to-day with Dr. Grace N. Kim
ball, recently a missionary physician at
Van, Armenia, and who is now at Vassar
College, her attention was directed to the
report in a New York newspaper of Sat
urday last from Constantinople and to
the dispatches from Washington in the
Sunday papers, wherein Secretary Olney
declares certain statements alleged to
have been made by her at Chickering
Hall, New York, to be unfounded. Dr.
Kimball states that she did not say at
Chickering Hall, or ut any other place,
either that the English flag is the only one
respected in Turkey, or tdat the American
flau r is not respected. If she was so re
ported, she said, the reporters misunder
stood her. She declares that what she
did say in substance, and now repeats, is
that in the interior where most of the
missionaries work and where the massa
cres have taken place, the British flag is
the one to which they look for protection.

WAS A BEAUTIFUL ACTRESS.
Death of Miss Leila Farrell Who Wanted
to Be Mrs. Nat Goodwin
No. 2.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 2.â Miss Leila
Farrell, who was one of the most beauti
ful women on the American stage, died
suddenly of grastritis yesterday at the
Park Avenue Hotel. She was about 28
years old. She first appeared on the
stage in this city as one of the actors In
"Adonis" at the Bijou Theater in 1887 and
her pretty face and dainty figure quickly
won for her a position. She made quite a
sensation in a new dance, and was credited
with being the first woman on the stage
to use black underwear, the rage for two
or three seasons.
There is no doubt that Leila fully ex
pected to become Mrs. Goodwin No. 2, but
she was doomed to disappointment, as the
actor was married in October, 1583, to
Miss Nellie Baker of Buffalo, against
whom he recently began divorce proceed
ings in California. Before thi3 marriaee
Miss Farrell found that he would not
make her his wife. She then carried a
big bundle of love letters to a lawyer's
office in tnis city and had a suit begun to
recover $10,000 for breach of promise.
Goodwin decided to compromise. On the
announcement of ins second marriage
Miss Farrell said she had known all abont
it in advance and given her consent.
She appeared for a while in "The Mas
cot" and then she fell ill and went to
Southern California. On her return to
New York she became a leading figure in
the eayest life of the metropolis. Then
she went to Europe, flitting f rom London
to Paris and Rome. She then decided to
return to the stage, but death cut short
her plans.
TROTTING REVIEW BOARD.
Some Cases of Long Standing Are Pre
sented, Argued and Taken Under
Advisement.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 2.â The board
of review of the National Trotting Asso
ciation resumed its session at the Murray
Hill Hotel to-day. The members present
were P. P. Johnston of Lexington, Ky.,
president; David Bonnerof this city, vice
president; Frank Brown, Charles Dana
Pa!mer, Lowell, Mas 3 .; U. C. Blake, Cedar
Rapids, lowa, and Colonel William Ed
wards of Cleveland. The meeting was
attended by many men well known in
local club life.
The sensational case of the pacing geld
ing, Charley P. which, although the board
ha 9 abundant business of a routine nature
to act upon, is the important ieature of
the annual meeting, was the first question
to be taken up to-day.
Mr. Meed, a lawyer from Boston, ap
peared for Morley and Fitzgerald. Fitz
gerald himself was the first witness. He
said he knew Clark. He had talked about
the horses at Morris Park. Medford and
Clark had said he was the owner of the
animal. He (Clark) bought the horse
without knowing his previous record, and
had trotted honestly. The well-known
driver, John M. Ramsey.was the nÂ°xt wit
ness, and said he trained and drove
Charley P in 1896 for Fitzeerald.
Lawyer Rees followed with an appeal
for Fitzgerald, in which he demanded mat
Fitzgerald be restored to the privileges of
the trotting turf. He also demanded that
punishment be meted out to the guilty
parties in the case. The reinstatement of
the horse was also asked for on the ground
that it had not been used as an instru
ment of fraud intentionally. The case
was laid over until the next seision.
The board next took up a case of ten
years' standing. In 1884 a race was trotted
at Dover, Ohio, which was given to a mare
named Belle Sargent. There was some
fouling in the race, and after Belle Sar
gent had won two heats and a horse called
Roger D one heat, after which Mercedes
won the heat, and consequently the race,
the judges decided it "no neat," and after
ward awarded the race to Bell? Sargent
on a walkover. The board In 1886 decided
that the judges erred, but Hicks has never
paid the money, and declared to-day that
he never would, although it is in the
hands of the association as custodian.
This case also went over.
Mr*. Jteecher Injured.
BROOKLYN, N. V., Dec. 2âWord has
been received in this city of on accident
which happened recently to Mrs. Henry
Ward Beecher, who is at the home of her
daughter, Mrs. Samuel Scoville, at Stam
ford, Conn. Mrs. Beecher went to Stam
ford for a Thanksgiving visit and felt well
and strong considering ier 84 years.
A few days ago In getting out of bed she
slipped and fell, striking her yead on the
floor. The fall rendered her unconscious
and she was found by her daughter some
time later. Mrs. Beecher is not able to
leave her room yet, but is improving and
expects soon to return to Brooklyn.
Farming of Prison Labor.
MILWAUKEE, Wis., Dec 2.âManu
facturers from all parts of the State met
here in mass meeting to=day for the pur
pose of initiating an agitation against
convict labor. Illinois and other adjoin
ing States are also represented. It is pro
posed to start an agitation for a constitu
tional amendment, urohibiting the farm
ing out of prison labor, and providing
that convicts shall be soley employed in
the nianulacture of articles needed in the
various State institutions or used by the
State for the building of public uighways,

Sale of a Large Sc'iooner.
GLOUCESTER, Mass., Dec. 2.â The
schooner Louise J. Kenny, owned by
Gardner Parsons of this city, the largest
fishing vessel belonging to this port, has
been sold to the Seattle Hardware Com
pany of Seattle. The new owners of the
vessel propose to fii her for the Pacific
cod fishery, and she will soon start on her
long journey via Cape Horn under com
mand of Captain Sidier, On reaching her
destination it is probable that she will be
fitted with auxiliary steam power. The
vessel is 155 tons, and was built in Essex
in 1888.

OMAHA, Nebr., Dec. 2.â Burglars broke
into the safe of the Nebraska Loan Office
last night and looted its safe of $5000
worth of watches, diamonds and jewelry.
Precautions taKen by the burglars to
avoid detection were as novel as ingenius.
Adjoining the pawnshop on the east is a
vacant store building. The frontdoor waa
opened with a skeleton key, although
there are iadications that a chisel may
have been used. From the store the
bur glars worked their way into the pawn
shop by tearing off the piaster between
the studdings and making a hole large
enough to crawl through. A small hole
was bored through the wall between the
vacant store and the pawnshop, in the
vicinity of the safe. A string about fifty
feet long was passed through the hole,
one end of which was held by a guard at
the front, while the other was so arranged
as to communicate with the Durglars at
work upon the safe.
The guard could peer through the
frozen plate-glass windows upon Douglass
street, watch the movements of the police
and passing pedestrians who might inter
fere with the robbery, and warn his pals
in time to escape through the rear door.
The safe-door knob was knocked off, and
a hole drilled through the lock controlling
the big bolt which manipulated the
tumblers. A punch displaced the lock,
and the big safe doors opened without the
use of explosives or creating any noise.
The inside doors were operated similarly,
with the result that the contents of the
safe, representing about $5000, were at the
disposal of the robbers.
Eleven trays of watches, diamonds and
jewelry were emptied, and the robbers
disappeared without leaving any clew.
DOMINION TARIFF COMMISSION.
Representatives of All Industries Ask \
for Additional Protection.
HAMILTON, Oxt., Dec 2â The Do
minion Government Tariff Commission
opened its investigation here yesterday,
taking evidence in the various industries
The Iruit-growera wanted an ad valorem
duty on plums and pears changed to a
specific duty of 1 cent per pound, and the
duty of 2 cents per pound on dried
peaches. The nurserymen, clothiers, hat
manufacturers and glass manufacturers
requested that the tariff be changed in
regard to the articles tney produced.
The manufacturers of cash registers
wanted the duty increased to 33 per cent
for better protection. The coffin manu
facturers askad that the duty be reduced
on raw materials which they have to im
port, and stated that even if the duty was
taken off coffins they could hold their own.
The spice manufacturers want at least a
16}Â£ per cent ad valorem duty and a 2
cent a pound specific duty on spices and
coffee.
The sewer pipe industry asks for a specific
duty of $5 per ton on sewer pipe. The
builders wanted the dnty on slate reduced
to 20 per cent. The Grocers' Guild sug
gested that the duty on rice be reduced
and rearranged; also the duty on syrup,
which was now almost prohibitive.
The fonndrymen desired the duty on
iron to remain as at present, but wanted
some minor alterations in the tariff re
garding emery wheels and other materials
used in their business. Some members of
the deputation said they would be quite
willing to have tbe tariff taken off alto
gether if the Americans also took down
tbpir tariff wall.
The manufacturers of tinners' tools and
carriage findings requested that the duty
be not altered. The fire brick -makers asked
that a duty be placed on fire brick, which
is at present free.

â  iftSW YORK, N. V., Dec. 2.â The Ward
'\\vn steamer Yumuri recently from
â¢/ifavaria brought news of the revolution
" >vhicn has grea.tlyencouraged the Cubans

In letter to a" Cuban in New York

statement tuat a number of Havana bank

revolution have sent word to Gomez and
Maceo that* they would Jet him have

WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 2.â The
Evening Star says: A Star reporter re
ceived an intimation from an unquestion
ably high and conservative source to-day
to the effect that the administration has
taken a much firmer stand on the Cuban
question thau the'public is led to believe.
The intimation is that early in November
Secretary Olney, at the instigation of the
President, gave the Spanish authorities to
understand that the United States had
waited patiently for the rebellion to be
crushed; that no progress appeared to be
making to that end, and that this Govern
ment would take positive steps within
three months if Spain had not succeeded
in putting an end to t!ie war or practi
cally ending it. This was conveyed to
Spain in a courteous way, but amounted
to an ultimatum. The time fixed will ex
pire in February, probably in the early
part, and nothing is expected to be done
until that time.
The above is given for what it is worth.
The Star prints it as a sensation on its
first page, but notwithstanding the Star's
reputation as a conservative and reliable
newspaper cot much credence is given its
report that the administration has taken
â uch a pronounced stand.

SAN DIEGANS ON IRRIGATION.
A Meeting of Prominent Citizens Con
dudes That the Wright Law
Should Be Repealed.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Dec. 2.â About 150
fruit-growers, farmers, lawyers, bond
holders and others interested in irrigation
and California's prosperity assembled in
the Chamber o? Commerce Auditorium
this evening to discuss with San Diego's
legislative representatives the Wright irri
gation law and the subject of its repeal or
amendment at the coming session of the
Legislature. Senator Withington and As
semblymen Guy and Dryden were pres
ent. Mr. Cravath of Escondido said he
was thoroughly in favor of the Wright law
as a whole, although he is not at all nar
row-minded regarding necessary amend
ments.
Mr. Kew was in favor of giving the law
a trial without making any amendments
at present. Mr. Kow owns land in the
Linda Vista district. D. Cave, who owns
400 acres in Jamaica district, concurred.
Judge Gibson also said the law was all
right when properly applied. He sug
gested some amendments, especially as to
the levying and collecting of taxes. If
Judge Ross' recent decision stood in its
wider application the Wright law was the
only salv.ation for the country, as private
corporations would be loth to invest in
water system?.
The meeting closed with a resolution
â¢submitted by Judge L. L. Boone to toe
effect that the Wright law should be up
held and that the matter of amendments
should be. left to the good judgment of
the Legislature at Sacramento, and San
Diego's representatives were thjia in
structed.

workmen on the Cotati ranch, near this
city, engaged in a quarrel yesterday after
noon, resulting in Frederick Donahue re
ceiving a deep knife wonr.d in the left
lung, from which he will probably die.

who escaped in the direction of Petal uma
and has not been captured. Donahue
claimed that Wood owed him $7, and
when payday arrived he demanded in
stant payment. Wood refused to settle,
aud claimed to owe nothing. This an
gered Donahue to frenzy, and seizing a
club he struck Wood a swinging blow over
the head. Wood partly warded the blow
off with his left arm, and drawing a keen
knife drove it through his assailant's left
sboulderblade into the lung. As Wood
acted in self-defense there has been no ef
fort to capture him as yet.

THE SAN FKATS CISCO CALL., THCESDAY, DECEMBER 3, 1896.
COUNCIL OF THE
AMERICAN HEBREWS
Agitation Demanded for the
Rights of the
Race.
It Is the Duty of Governments to
Prevent Persecution Because
of Religion.
Strong Recommendation That the Af
fairs of Church and State Ba
Kept Separate.
LOUISVILLE, Ky-, Dec. 2.â The fif
teenth Council of the Union American
Hebrew Congregations closed this after
noon with one of the most important ses
sions in the order's history.
There was a long discussion on the re
port of the committee on civil and relig
ious bigots, which ended in the report be
ing adopted. It is a very strong docu
ment, and calls for agitation through the
public press toward securing the rights of
Jews, it holding that this win be more
efficient than working through the State
Department. It is held, however, to be
the duty of civilized Governments to pro
test against the persecution of any peo
ple on account of religious belief, and
where protest is useless interference by
such methods as may secure the sacred
rights of human beings.
The report opposes any change in the
constitution of the United States toward
recognizing any form of religion, and it is
recommended that the board of delegates
inaugurate and maintain strenuous agita
tation to bring about the omission from
all executive proclamations of phrases
recognizing particular religious doctrine.
It is insisted that such official docu
ments and acts.be limited to the accom
plishment of governmental duties, and
that the expression of a rel igious idea ema
nating from executive sources is subver
sive of the fundamental idea of our Gov
ernment that church and state should for
ever remain separate and distinct. The
report concludes as follows:
"While we recognize that often allu
sions in executive proclamations to par
ticular religious dogmas aro used as fig
ures of speech, we protest against expres
sions as giving color to the oft-repeated
assertions that our Government recognizes
a religion."
STANFORD'S TRACK TEAM.
Ordered to Appear In Working Harness
Three Evenings in the Week
From Now On.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Dec.
2.â Captain Charles S. Dole of ihe Stan
ford track team has issued a call to all
candidates for the team to meet on the
track three evenings each week from now
on in their track suits. This was the first
day after the call, but sir men appeared
for work, and many more have promised
to be on hand hereafter. Mondays,
Wednesdays and Fridays are the days
selected for track work, and Dole intends
to keen the men busy from now on.
Oi Stanford's prospects Captain Dole
thinks it a little early to speculate, but
with the loss of several of the last year's
stars through graduation, and the proba
ble departure of Brunton '99 at tbe end of
tbe present semester, the outlook is rather

Will Accept the Portfolio of
Secretary cf the Navy.

in Congress with Major McKinley, dis
cussed judge Waymire in a friendly way.

he said: "I have known Judge Waymire
for a long time. He is a sound-money
man, a clean, clever politician and a good
man of affairs. His standing and his char
acter are of the highest. His appoint
ment to a Cabinet position wonhi give
great satisfaction and encouragement to
Republicans on the Pacific Coast. Judge
Waymire was one of Major McKinley's
most efficient friends in California."
J. W. Babcock, chairman of the Repub
lican Congressional Committee, talked for
a long time with Major McKinley and Mr.
Hanna lata this afternoon. He discussed
the wisdom of establishing permanent
headquarters and said if a campaign of
education was carried on in the two Da

for two or three years those States could
be brought into the Republican column.

son of the G. A. R. and his staff; Hon.
Henry White of Pennsylvania, who served
in Congress with Major McKinley. Sena

entirely cured me of nervous debility and kidney trouble. I feel better now than I
ever did before in mv life, as it has made a new man of me. I will gladly recommend
your belt as it surely does all you claim for it. Yours, gratefully, </: : ' â¢ -

. // Every sick person, no matter how light his complaint, wants
to feel sure of getting relief when he trusts his health to any
form of treatment. It can truly be said for Dr. Sanden's Electric
Belt that no remedy ever offered such absolute proof of its cura-
| tive powers as this \ wonderful ] Belt does. The proof comes < fresh
from different places every day, and from > people you can see
and talk to.
; Arid it is not strange that Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt should
cure after all other remedies fail, for it is the most humane, 1
natural remedy. It gives the constant, life-inspiring electricity
into your system while you sleep at night. This restores health.
It is convenient to use, as you put it on as you go to bed, and
wear it all night. If you wish the current stronger or milder at
any ! time, it has a regulator which controls its power, and you
feel it all the time. Â :

FEDERATED STATE ALUMNI

A movement is on foot among represen

the University of California "to unite all
the graduates of the various branches into
one great federation of alumni, indepen
dent of the several associations maintained
for years past by graduates of each of . the
affiliated colleges and \by , those of the
academic department at Berkeley. , The
idea is to have a closer common bond of
sympathy among all the graduates ,to
gether, with an ann vial almuni day during
commencement week at Berkeley, on
\ which occasion each alumnus may swell
his chest in pride say, "Governor
Budd and I are graduates of the Univer

Berkeley, were present as follows: From
the academic â¢ colleges at Berkeley, 1 Pro
fessor W. A. Ritter '86, ; Dr. A. A. d'An

Berkeley and of the medical college also.
A form of constitution previously drafted
was submitted by. a committee appointed
a month before and consisting of Dr.
Ritter, Mr. Bartiett, Dr. Seager and Dr.
Terry. The constitution provides for a
Federated "Alumni. Association of the
University of California.; It will be sub
mitted after some minor alterations to. all
the alumni associations lor their approval
at the next meeting of each. It is believed
that the federation will : be !an accom
plished * fact long . before commencement
week at Berkeley next May, as all those
interested are enthusiastic and anticipate
little opposition.

that ' the federation would ' brace over

college 350, of the law college 350, of the
dental college 250, of tne college of phar

I view at first with its benefits to the univer
sity, some of the promoters of the Idea are
looking forward to the possibilities in the
future of a numerous organization capable

THE FRUIT-GROWERS.
The annual convention oi the State
Fruit-growers' Association has given an
otHer illustration of the sanguine and
hopeful spirit which now animates the
people of California. While it was ad
mitted that the past few years have not
been prosperous ones to the growers of
fruit, there were evident in the addresses
made and in all the proceedings of the
body an assurance of better times to come
and a determination to make the best use
of them.
In his opening address, President El
wood Cooper pointed out that one of the
immediate duties before the fruit-growers
of the State was that of providing means
for taking a fuller advantage of the Ameri
can market. After referring to the de
pression in the industry in years, he
said: "To remedy any and all these con
ditions we have just one thine to do, and
Xhat is to nnite and sell no fruit that does
not give a fair profit to the producer. If
we increase the production we must in
crease the distribution. There are a great
many places that would take quantities of
fruit if an effort was made to reach tnern.
Each grower has been increasing his
product and selling it as he could or ship
ping it and trusting to luck until r.ll are
well nigh ruined. Shall this mode be
continued?"
Whether it is possible to bring about
that complete co-operation which Mr.
Cooper favors is questionable. The fruit
industry is very large, and it will be diffi
cult to get so many men to combine and
work harmoniously together. There is
one point of his plan, however, which is
certainly feasible. Mr. Cooper pointed
out that even if we had combination
among the home growers it would be im
possible to prevent competition with
fruits imported from foreign countries.
"Therefore, " he said, "we should insist
upon a higher tariff duty, so as to prevent
the market from being flooded with such
importations." To lhat extent at any
rate it would seem that combination is
easy, and an earnest effort should be be
gun at once by ihe fruit men to obtain
thi3 needed protection for their industry.
The address of General Chipman was
even more encouraging than that of
President Cooper. He showed by statis
tics that the amount of fruit produced in
Calilornia is so far below the limit of con
sumption in this country that up to the
present time the peopie of the United
States can hardly be said to have tasted
it. A striking illustration of how far we
fall short oi reachinsr the market that is
open for us was Kiven in the statement
that while there are many Cities and con
siderable towns, in the United States in
which California fruit is not to be had,
there is not a village in the Union too small
to be supplied with beer.
Taken as a whole, the proceedings of the
convention were decidedly encouraging
to the lruit industry. Whatever draw
backs exist lit present cau be removed by
energy and sagacity on the part of the
growers. Wo are still on the safe side of
the danger line of overproduction. Cali
fornia can go forward with ttie assurance
that in this as in all other of her indus
tries there is room yei for a large and
profitable development.
A PACIFIC CABLE.
According to reports from Washington,
it is expected an effort will be made at the
coming session of Congress to procura the
passage of tlie Hawaiian cab.c bill, which
was tavorabiy reported by the Commutee
on Commerce of both the Senate and of
the House of Representatives at ..he last
session.
The bill is entitled "An act to facilitate
the construction ana maintenance of tele
graphic communication batweeu the
United States, the Hawaiian Islands,
Japan and China, and to promote com
merce." Much interest was shown in the
project during the last session of Con
tress, but it came up too late for any ac
tion tv be taken on it at that time.
By the provisions oi the bill reported
to the House of Representatives the Post
master-Uenerai is authorize.i to enter into
a contract with the Pacific Cab.c Company
for the payment thereto of $100,000 a year
for twenty years, for tae construction ana
operation of an electric submarine cubl
from tiau Francisco to Honolulu, and such
places on the coasts of China and Japan
as the company with his approval may
select.
These provisions are subject, of course,
to conditions which will t,uard the Gov
ernment irom loss in case the company
should Sail to fultill any part of its con
tract. It is probable that either this or a
bill of a similar nature will be taken up as
soon as Congress meets and pushed for
ward as rapidly as possible. Public inter
est in the subject ha; grown steadily ever
since the proposal to annex the islands to
the United S.ates was first brought for
ward. It has been increased of late by
the growing desire for an expansion of
American commerce, and has, therefore, a
stronger support than ever before.
In its report in favor of the passage of
the bill the House committee cailed at
tention to the fact that within the last few
years the United States Government has
been at great expense in maintaining men
of war for purposes of communication be
tween California and the Hawaiian
Islands owing to the lack of means of ca
ble communication, ana went on to say:
"As far as Japan, China and other por
tions of the Asiatic continent are con
cerned, the present rates charged for mes
sages between the United States and those
countries are so high as to be practically
prohibitive except where matters of the
highest importance are involved."
These considerations have lost none of
their weight since the time they were first
submitted, and will have no little effect in
determining Congress to take some action
this winter. The cable, it is needless to
say, will be of great advantage to San
Francisco, and will have a tendency to
promote our commerce with the islands
and the Orient. We can therefore regard
with satisfaction the prospects of an im
mediate passage of the bill and give it
cordial support when it comes up before
Congress. ______^________
THE PUBLIC DEBT.
The official statement for the month
just issued by the Treasury Department
shows the public debt, less casti in the
treasury, now amounts to $995,769,159, be
ing an increase for the month of Novem
ber of $8,270,283. Thus another largo
amount is added to the increasing deficit,
and the situation of the treasury is as
gloomy as it has been at any time during
the Cleveland administration.
These monthly statements, showing a
steady increase in the public debt, consti
tute a strong argument in favor of some
kind of tariff legislation during the com
ing winter. Many members of Congress
believe that it is the tfrst duty to provide
the Government with a revenue adequate
to its expenditure, leaving the Droader
subject of a thorough restoration of the
protective system to the next Congress.
That there are good reasons for this po
sition is beyond question. It is to some
extent disgraceful that a Nation so rich
as ours should be running further into
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 3, 1896.
debt every month in a time of profound
peace and under circumstances when there
is seemingly required only the exercise of
common sense on the part of the admin
istration and Congress io provide the Gov
ernment with an income not only suffi
cient to pay current expenses but to leave
a handsome surplus for the steady reduc
tion of Xational indebtedness.
These reasons in favor of tariff legisla
tion during the winter are met, however,
by reasons of great force in opposition to
such action. Nothing can be done at the
coming session except the passage of some
form of compromise measure. Any tariff
duties adopted this winter, therefore,
would be very short lived, for it is certain
the McKinley administration will call an
extra session for the purpose of re-estab
lishing a thorough system of protection
for the promotion of the industries of the
country as^ speedily as possible. It seems
clear, therefore, that the country might
well wait for a few months rather than to
disturb business by altering the tariff now,
when it is foreseen that other alterations
will be made within months.
Dispatches from Washington yesterday
state that the administration will en
deavor to procure the passage of a tax on
beer for the purpose of providing addi.
tional revenue. This and other measures
of the kind will probably be brought for
ward as soon as Congress meet 3. It is
doubtful, however, whether even such
measures as these will find any strong
support in either House. The determina
tion of the policy to be pursued will be for
the Republican caucus to decide as soon
a-- Congress meets, and fortunately for the
country this time the subject is in the
hands of practical statesmen, and not in
those of the free- trade theorists and polit
ical bunglers who have brought the de
ficits upon us.
A GALA NIGHT.
The progressive merchants of Sixth
street, between Market and Folsoni. are
making arrangements to give the City a
festival next Saturday night in celebration
of the work which they have accomplished
in the way of improving that thorough
fare. It is to be hoped that the occasion
will be successful in every respect, for the
improvement is one of which the promo
ters may be justly proud, and in which
they may rightly rejoice.
The celebration very appropriately will,
be one of illumination. It ought to serve
to throw light not only upon the improve
ments of that street, but upon the whole
subj ct of street improvements. It should
be bright enough to attract the attention
of merchants and property-owners in
every district of the City and awake in
them a spirit of earnest emulation.
Street improvern nts of all kinds are
needed in San Francisco. We need bet
ter paving, better sweeping, better light
ing and better sewers. It matters not in
which of these features of our streets the
improvement takes place, it will be
worthy of a celebration Whenever it is ac
complished. It is in the highest degree
satisfactory that at this lime merchants
and property-owners in so many sections
of the City are working with energy for
nearly all forms of these improvements,
lor their work gives a reasonable hope
that it will not be long before great re
sults will be attained.
The men of Sixth street will have plenty
of commendations to inspire them to a
tru- rejoicing when they hold their gala
night on Saturday. They will be the re
cipients of coneratulations from all sides,
and will no doubt have a large concourse
of people from all other sections of the
City to help them make the festival com
mensurate with the occasion and worthy of
the bard work and genuine public spirit
which were involved in the task they
have accomplished.
AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
Frank Ross of Tacoma is in the City direct
from New York, in company with other cap
italists, negotiating for the construction of an
electric railway line from Tacoma to Seattle.
Mr. Ross is one of the most progressive men
in tiie Northwest. During the nctive times in
the Puget Sound country, from 1887 to 1892,
he was a leader in enterprise. He built and
equipped the Tacoma and Olympia Railroad
and subsequently sold it to the Union Pacific
Railroad Company. Hencquired a remarkable
influence among the Puyallup tribe of ludUns,
wnose reservation touches the eastern line of
the city of Tacoma and extends along the
eastern shore of Commencement Bay, on I'l'tet
Soundâ the western shore being the water
front of Tacoma.
Some years ago Mr. Ross, with the consent
and the aid, as laborers, of the Indians, begun
the building of a railroad through the reserva
tion toward Seattle. He was ordered by the
War Department to cease, but continued riirht
along, claiming that the Indians themselves
were building the road through their own
ervation, and that they had a right to do so.
A company of infantry was ordered from
Vancouver to the piace, and for a tima things
looked warlike. The matter went into the
court, and Ross, if not defeating the Govern
ment itself, still maintained his footiiold, and
has now a clenr right of way, and with the
signs of returning prosperity, is about to un
dertake the building of the ro.-id again.
Ross has been traveling in the South and
East for some months, and is accompanied
here by several Chicago and New York men
who are interested in. his enterprise.
TO MEASURE DISTANCES.
Avery ingenious instrument for measuring
distances has recently beea patented.
Upon a handle placed as to about balance
the two ends of the instrument is an arm three
feet long, extended at right angles to a tele
scope, the end of the arm nearest the telescope
having a graduation scale for either angles or
distances. Rigidly mounted on the arm, coin-
The Telemeter.
cident with the lower half of the field of the
telescope, is a horizon glass, whicti is shown
as a right-angle prism, and pivoted to the
outer end of the arm is ft lever which extends
under the horizon glass, and has an adjustable
vernier coactin? with the adjacent graduation
on the arm. An index glass, shown ia the
illustration as a right-angle prism, is rigidly
connected to the pivoted end of the lever, its
reflecting surface being at an anule of 45 de
gress to ihe axis of the lever.
On looking through the telescope and hori
zon glass at an object whose distance is to be
measured the lever Is moved to cause the in
dex glass to receive the image and reflect it to
the noriz.m glass at a point coincident with
the line oi collimatlon. The angie will be de
term:ned by the vernier, and the base line be
ing known the distance of the object may be
readily computed or ascertained from pre
pared tables. If desired the scale may be
marked empirically for certain distances,
which can then be read at once.
The condition of the celebrated Hungarian
painter Munkacsy, whose health had been

MUSIC AND MUSICIANS,
For the last four years Hugo R. Herold, son oi
the pioneer California musician, the late Ru
dolph Herold, has been one of the most pop
ular drawing-room vocalists In the smart set
in London. Not that his efforts have been
limited to the dra wing-room, for he has sung
frequently before large audiences in concert,
notably at the People's Palace, m a series of
concerts, but on the whole he is quoted as one
of the few Western artists whom it has become
the "fad," so to speak, for swell hostesses to
secure for their guens' delectation, and draw
ing-room singing in the Old World is a dis
tinctly profitable as well as a pleasurable oc
cupation. Mr. Herold has won distinction in
Brussels, too, both as a teacher and a vocalist.
One of the best known Belgian dilettanti,
HUGO R. HEROLD, the California Barytone Who Has "Won
Distinction in London.
Count dcV , recently studied the role of
Lohengrin with him, en amateur. Having
covered himself with distinction abroad, the
California barytone is on his way to pay a
brief visit to his mother and brothers in this
City. He went away nine years ago and has
never come home since. His first studies
abroad were in Paris, mainly under Warot, of
the Conservatoire, and while in the French
capital he was present at a number of re
markable musical events, notably the five
hundredth performance of "Faust' 1 at the
Grand Opera, where Charles Gounod con
ducted. After acquainting himself well with
the works of the French school the young
Californiun went to Italy, where hestudled un
der jhe maestro Francesco Lamperti. Now that
he has acquired a solid po.sition for himself in
London Mr. Herold feels that he can give him
self the long promised treat Of a Chrisiniars In
San Francisco, and his many friends here are
prepariug to give him a welcome.
The distinguished barytone, Victor Maurel,
has the reputation of being of a fault-finding
and cantankerous disposition, a peculiarity to
which his non-apj earance with the Metro
politan Opera Company this season is largely
due. Quite recently Mozart's "Don Juan" was
revived at the Paris Grand Opera, and Maurel
took occasion to pick a quarrel with the di
rector, M. Gailhard, on the subject, because he
declared that the dimensions oi the stage were
far too vast for Mozart's cbet u'ceuvre. Seeing
that the papers were airing Maurei's criticism
pretty extensively, M. Bertrand, the manager
ol the Grand Opera, } ad himself interviewed
on the subject and remarked, "I do not know
whether the stage of ihe Opera is too vast for
'Don Juan', but what 1 do know is that the
auditorium of the Opera is too small for all the
people who come to upplaud Mozart's opera,
for we are turning people away at every per
formance."
"What is your answer to that, Mauiel?" asks
Le Figaro.
DlscusMng the late William Steinway, Man
ager y. Friealander, who knew him well, re
marked yesterday: "Neither Abbey nor any
other impresario backed so many great artists
as SteinwHy did. Christine Xilsson, Patt:, Sem
brich, Scalchi, Joseph Hoffman, Frieda Simon
son and a host of others were helped on con
cert tours by Wililum Sieiuway, indeed, J may
say that there are numbers of.great artists
who would never have been heard in this
country if Steinway had not brought them
over. He was one of the most charming men
to meet personally, and his love for music and
efforts to popularize a taste for good music
were constant and unremitting."
A great success has been obtained at the
Mercadante Theater of Naples by a new opera
in three acts entitled "La Collana di Pasqua."
The libretto is by Luigi Illica and the music by
G. Luporina. The work is said to be very
touching and dramatic, and the music pro
duced the most profound impression. The
composer was called nineteen times before the
curtain. "La Collana di Pasqua" is about to
be played in Milan at the Dal Verme, and will
probably receive an almost immediate produc
tion in other Italian towns.
Van Dyck, the principal tenor of the Paris
Grand Opera and at the Vienna Opera-house,
bus been engaged by Grau for a couple of
seasons at Covent Garden, beginning next
spring. It is not stated whether the contract
includes a winter season in America, but
probably it does not, as Vienna will claim him
for part of each winter.
A grand concert will be given on December
19 in Golden Gate Hall, for the purpose of
raising $400 to pay the rent of the French
Reformed Church. Efforts are being made to
secure a distinguished California vocalist
from the East as the star attraction for the
occasion, but till negotiations are finally com
pleted the name of the singer will not be
divulged.
Ignace Brull, the well-known Viennese com
poser, has just celebrated his fiftieth birthday,
and received on the occasion the felicitations
oi his confreres, Brahms, Goldmark and
Johann Strauss. The Viennese papers give
long paragraphs to praising him, for Brull
has never advnnced himself by way of in
trigue, and has always placed his great talent
as a pianist at the disposition of his friends
and oi charity.
Frau Adelheid Wette, the sister of Humper
dinck, who wrote his libretto for "Hansel and
Gretal," is just about to have an opera of the
same kind played at the Municipal Theater of
Cologne. She has written both the words and
the libretto of the new work, which is called
"The King ol the Frogs."'
It would not be Mapleson if he did not quar
rel with his artists on the subject of "making
the ghost walk," as they say in theatrical par
lance. Two of the distinguished impresario's
company have already left for Europe in high
dudgeon because their salaries were not forth
coming.
The European musical papers announce that
Mascagni bas renounced, the idea of an im
mediate tour in America to conduct his own
works, as he is too much occupied in writing
his new opera "Iride," which will not be ter
minated till next year.
Letters from Milan state that the perform
ances of "Manon'* at the Lyric Theater con
tinue to be veritable triumphs for Miss Sibyl
Sanderson and for the tenor, Pandofini. The
California prima donna is soon to sing
"Phryne" in Milan.
Egypt must be becoming indeed civilized,
fjr the first number has just been issued of a
musical and dramatic paper in Alexandria
devoted to the interests of Egyptian lyric and
dramatic art. It is called the Egyptian
Stage.
And now Cad Wilson is s tarring at the Tro-
cadero in New York as "The Yvette Guilbert
of the West."
Some of the French papers bring Bryan
home to their readers by saying "if 'La Car
magnole' had been American the boy orator
would have sung it."

HORSES FOR McKINLEY
Washington Post-
President-elect McKiniev will probably have
two of the handsomest horses ever seen in
Washington. The late General Joseph T.Tor
rence of Chicago possessed as fine a stable of
horses as was owned in the Windy City. It
was the general's intention before his death
that two magnificent brown horses, the best
matched pair in ri-> stable", should be pre
sented to Mr. McKinley to ride behind to the
Capitol on Inauguration day, in the event of
his electfon. The General left no writien will
to this effect, but it is said that his daughter
Mrs. Magouu, who has come luto possession of
tho estate, will probably carry out her father's
wiatti and present the horses to the President
elect, and that they will take their place in
the White House stables on the Ith of March.

HOW MR. WATT TOOK MONEY
OUT OF THE PEOPLE'S BANK
New Developments in the Trial of the Williams-
Hebbard Libel Case Before Judge Daingerfield
Yesterday.
Manipulation by Which the Jen
ningson Stock Was Voted
for the Watt Directors.
3ENIAL THAT COIN WAS PAID.
Judge Hebbard Swore That His Prom
ise Mjde to the Depositors Was
Qual fiei.
The salient features of the trial of J. S.
Williams Jr. for publishing an alleged li
dp! on Judge Hebbard, as they were de
veloped yesterday, consisted in the estab
lishment of the fact that James Alva Watt
had drawn $3200 from the bank on ac
count of his attorney's fees and expenses
before the board of directors had allowed
him a dollar.
It was also developed that 3440 shares of
the bank stock had been given to William
Jenningson for his note for and
that after Jenningson's wife had, as his
proxy, voted these shares for the WWa t-
Sheehan directors, 3100 of the shares were
canceled and the note wiped off the books.
The attorneys for the defense inquired as
to whether Mr. Watt had paid Mrs. Jen
niueson for the service she had rendered
him by voting for his directors, but Mr.
Watt, under oath, denied thai he had
paid her anything.
It was admitted by the prosecution that
tiie bank depositors at their meeting bad
said disDara^ing things concerning Mr.
Watt and his reputation.
Judge Hebbard testified that his promise
to the depositors' committee that he
would allow the directors to resign and
elect a new board was qualified with the
proviso that ail the. parties in interest
snould agree as to the personnel of the
new directors. The parties in interest
having failed to agree on this point, the
order of injunction remained in force.
General Sheehan resumed the stand yes
terday morning, having brought with him
certain books of the bank. Hi 3 attention
was directed by Mr. Thornton to the pro
ceedings of the stccknolders' meeting of
July 5, 1894. After the record had been
identified Mr. Thornton offered it in evi
dence for the purpose of showing that at
that meeting Messrs. Watt and Sheehan
secured control of the management of tie
bank, having previously agreed as to the
method by which that control should be
secured.
Mr. Thornton read the record aloud. It
set forth the fact that the stockholders
had met on the date mentioned .'or the
purpose of removing the directors and ap
pointing others in their stead. The call
for the meeting was issueti by Dr. Bouchey.
â¢ The meeting was called to order by Dr.
Boucliey. It was found that 8962 shares of
the capital stock were represented. After
rollcall Samuel M. Shortridge demanded
that ttie books should be produced in
oruer to ascertain whether the list of the
stockholders was a correct one, but the
books were in the custody of General
Sneehan and he would not allow them to
go out of his hands. The matter was
finally settled by tbe secretary offering to
certify to the correctness of the roll.
Tuen the existing board of directors
were ousted by a majority vote, and on
motion of James Alva Watt the following
named directors were elected: George
Stone. Rolla V. Watt, S. A. McDonnell,
S. P. Young, I. L. Merrell, S. K. Thornton
and John K. Hillman. Tne meeting then
adjourned.
Mr. Thornton asked the witness, Gen
eral Sheehan, whether the record to the
effect that he had refused to produce tbe
books was correct, and the witness replied
that he believed it was. He was asked
whether at the time he knew as a fact that
upon the election of these directors he
would be appointed secretary and manager
of the bank. He replied that he expected
some such action was to be taken, and he
admitted that, he helped to secure the
e.ection of the directors named, with all
of whom he was acquainted.
Tbe witness was asked whether it was
true that William Jenningson owned up
ward of 3440 shares as set down in the
minutes of the ballot for the directors,
and he replied that he believed such to be
the fuct. In response to another question
General Sheehan sail that he could not
say that at that time he was aware that
two injunctions were about to be served
forbidding tne voting of those 3440 shares
of stock. He left all law questions to nis
attorney.
Mr. Thornton inquired as to whether
the 3440 shares had been issued and paid
for. Tne witness replied f. hat the stocfc
was sold by the McDonald board of direc
tors to William Jenningson for something
over $lUO,COO, taking his note for that
amount. I'ne note and the whole tran
saction were subsequently wiped off thÂ«
buoks and the 310U shares of the stock
were canceled something over a year ago.
Presuming that that stocK had not
been represented at that meeting there
would have been a presentation of
5476 votes, less than two-thirds of the
totai stock. The witness believed that the
3440 shares were voted for the successful
directors. There was only one opposiiion
candidate, Charles Montgomery.
The witnesÃ uenied that he had asked
Mrs. Jenningson to vote for the board of
directors, or that he had paid her any
money for doing so. She held her hus
band's proxy.
"Do you know whether James Alva
Watt paid her any money for her vote?'
asked Mr. Thornton.
"1 do not," was the reply. "I don't
think I ever conversed with Mr. Watt on
that subject."
The witness went on to state that S. K.
Thornton held some proxies â that of E.
H. Knight and Georce Stone â at that
meeting, and that Mr. Thornton was a
personal friend of his and that the stock
holders had the highest confidence in him.
Mr. Foote objected to this line of exam
ination, and Mr. Thornton explained tnat
he proposed to establish the truth of the
assertion in the circular to the effect that
James Alva Watt procured the election of
the directors for the purpose of obtaining
control of the management of the affairs
of the bank.
The objection was sustained, and Mr.
Thornton passed on to another line of in
quiry. He asked the general to identify
the report filed by him in court in Janu
ary, 1895. as receiver of the bank. The
witness did not know whether he had
made any other reports, but he believed
that he had previously made a general re
port of affaits to Judge Hebbard.
"General Sheehan, how much money in
cash, assets in cash, were turned in to you
as receiver between May 19, 1894, and Jan
uary 9, 1895?" ask d Mr. Thornton.
The witness could not state without
consulting the books, but he received for
the bank more than $100,000. He dis
bursed during the same period $42,993.
H- believed that there were vouchers for
all sums paid out.
"Did you June 25, 1894, pay $200 to
James Alva Watt?" was asked.
The witness could not remember with
out an inspection of the books.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 3, 1896.
"Have you any vouchers for that pay
ment?'
Mr. Foote objected to the question as
irrelevant. The witness had already testi
fied that he had expended ?42,995, and
that statement should cover the whole
subject.
"Did James Alva Watt receive on June
5, 1894, $300?"
A like objection was made.
"How much did James Alva Watt re
ceive from you as receiver for his services
during the period named?"
Mr. Foote objected again, and the wit
ness replied that he knew what was the
sum total allowed by the directors. Mr.
Foote proposed to admit that Mr. Watt
received for his services $500 per month
during the ppriod from May 19, 1894, to
January 9, 1895.
Mr. Thornton said that he proposed to
show that Watt had drawn $3250 out of
the bank before any allowance had been
Mr. Foote Objecting to Searching Questions Put by Attorney Baker for the Defense. General Sheehan

From the Bank Without Authority. Attorney Thornton Asking About the Jenningson Stock.
made to him by the board of directors.
He asked the witness whether Watt, on
June 5. 1894, had received $300. Tne wit
ness consulted the cashbook, and replied
that such was the fact. He also found au
entry of $200 paid to Watt on June 25, and
a day or two afterwarn $500. There was
another payment of $800 as legal expenses,
and on July 25 $500 for attorney's fees.
Various other entries were read, the whole
amounting to $3200, as Mr. Thornton de
clared, before the directors had made Watt
any allowance whatever.
These revelations were listened to with
great interest by the depositors, who
crowded the courtroom.
General Sheehan was asked whether he
was an intimate friend of Judge Heb
bard, and he replied that he was and had
known him for about six years. They
were Doth members of the Union League
Club and the San Francisco Press Club.
Daniel T. Cole and Colonel D. M. Burns
were the bondsmen of the witness as re
ceiver of tbe bank and also as secretary
and manager.
"Did you ever attend a political conven
tion at Sacramento for the purpose of
furthering the political aspirations of
Judge Hebbard?" asked Mr. Thornton.
"I did. That was one of my objects in
attending that convention," replied the
general. He added that James Alva Watt
was there as delegate and both were look
ing after the official aspirations of Judge
Hebbard. He did not remember whether
Judge .Hebbard's name was placed in
nomiuation at the convention in 1894 or
not.
On the cross-examination Mr. Foote
asked the witness whether be had baa
anything to do with the sale of 3440 shares
of stock to William Jenningson or the ac
ceptance of tbe note in payment thereof,
and the witness rep.ied that he bad not.
Abraham D. Frace, a clerk out ofem
nloyment and a depositor in the People's
Home Savings Bank, was called to the
stand and was asked as to his knowledge
of the reputation of James Afiva Wan.
He said that he had beard Mr. Watt's
character discussed in public meetings of
the depositors. The criticisms on Mr.
Watt by the depositors at meetings in
B'nai B'rith Hall and elsewhere were of a
very uncomplimentary and disparaging
character. These meetings were held after
the failure of the bank and before October
16, the date of the pub ication of the al
leged hbelous circular. He had also seen
condemnatory publications in tbe news
papers concerning Watt and his conduct
iv the management of tbe Dank.
Mr. Fuote announced that he would ad
mit that the remaining witnesses, Messrs.
Foster, Pascoe, iiobst and Morcum, would
testify with regard to the meetings of the
depositors and to their speeches condem
natory ot James Alvi Watt in the same
manner as Mr. McCarthy and Mr. Frace.
He would consider that those two facts
had been established.
Assemblyman George W. Dixou was
called after the noon recess and narrated
how he had been asked by Dr. Frederick
W. Harris to serve as a director oi the
banu. The witness was asked by George
W. Batter of counsel for the defense
whether James Alva Watt had requested
him to serve as a director. Mr. Foote
promptly objected, and Mr. Baker an
nounced that he desired to prove that.
Watt bad so manipulated matters as to
get his friends on tbe board of directors of
tne bank so that he could be the attorney
for the bank, as charged in the alleged
libelous publication.
Julius Kahn of counsel for the prosecu
tion replied to Mr. Baker, and remarked
that the court had ruled several times on
the subject of the relevancy of the testi
mony offered.
Mr. Baker argued that the circular did
not charge that Judge HeDbardhad knowl
ertce of the character and acts of Mr.
Watt, and be had a right to prove the
iruth of tbe alleged libel. The circum
stances of this case presumed. that Judge
Hebbard bad fall knowledge of what was
done. H- considered that tbe allegation
that Judge Hebbard was an unfair Judge
was entirely predicated on the truth of
what followed, and it was for the jury to
say whether or not they had proved the
allegations on which the first allegation
was predicated.
Mr. Foote argned that any fcction of Mr.
Wutt, without tlie knowledge of Judge
Hebbard, would not bind or be a reflection
upon the J udge. He therefore objected to
the testimony.
Mr. Baker claimed the right to prove
every portion of the circular alleged to be
defamatory.
Mr. Henley argued that there was no
charge that Judge Hebbard had knowledge
of the acts or character of Watt and Bhee
nan, but that the implication was that
Judge Hebbard carelessly, negligently and
inadvertently allowed these things to be
done, and that a Judge should not be care
less, negligent or inadvertent. The de
fense proposed to prove Dy the witness
that Watt did scheme to have a board of
directors elected in his interest.
The court ruled that if the matter had
been brought to the attention of Judge
Hebbard and was within bis knowledge
he, the court, would admit the evidence.
Otherwise not.
Mr. Henley Baid that he could prove it
by other witnesses, and Mr. Dixon was ac
cordingly withdrawn.
Attorney Bartnett was recalled for the
purpose of relating what happened at a
meeting of the board of directors on Janu
ary 14, 1595. when a blanket resolution ap
proving of the acts of the receiver was
passed.
Mr. Foote objected and Mr. Henley pro
posed to prove that Mr. Watt had ap
peared at a meeting of stockholders and
had jretoorted to them certain expendi
tures, while he withheld from them infor
mation as to other expenditures. This
was a circumstance tending to prove the
truth of one of the allegations of the cir
cular that the money of the bank had
been squandered and otherwise improperly
used.
The court sustained the objection.
Mr. Thornton asked the witness whether
he had had any knowledge of an injunc
tion about to be served on the board of
directors prohibiting the voting of the
3440 shares held by Jennincson.
There was another objection and the
court sustained it. While Mr. Henley was
commenting on the ruling, Mr. Foote in
terrupted him by remarking that the court
had passed upon the matter, and that Mr.
Hetuev was simply wasting time.
Mr. Henley replied that he was follow
ing the example of Mr. Fcote, and that
gentleman retorted by saying that Mr.
Henley was niasing a statement devoid of
truth. This, Mr. Henley denied, and Mr.
foote remarked that Mr. Henley had made
a -tatement which he knew not to be true.
Mr. Henley was retorting in Kind, when
the court called both gentlemen to order
in time to prevent the passing of the lie
direct.
James Alva Watt was called to the wit
ness stand by the defense, and in reply to
questions by Mr. Thornton sÃ)d that he
had been acquainted with Judge Hebbard
for about sixteen years. The witness at
tended a convention in Sacramento and
did all he could to further Judge Heb
bard's nomination, but his name was not
placed before the convention. General
Sheeban was in Sacramento at the time,
but he was not a delegate to the conven
tion.
On the 6th of July, 1894, the witness was
appointed attorney for the bank. He was
made the attorney for the receiver on tbe
same day on which General Sheehan was
appointed receiver. The witness was
present at the meeting when the new di
rectors were elected and appeared as a
representative of the parties named in the
books.
"Did you or did you not control the
casting of the vote of 3440 shares held in
the name of William Jenningson?" asked
Mr. Thornton.
"I did not," replied Mr. Watt; "1 had
no control over them whatever. They
were cast by Mrs. Jenningson, the wife of
tbe owner of the shares, who acted as his
proxy."
He had never seen Mrs. Jenningson be
fore the day on which she appeared at the
meeting.
Mr. Henley called Louis Jacobs to the
stand and offered in evidence a record in
the divorce suit against George E. White,
the Mendocino cattle king. He said that
it was charged in the circular that Hab
bard was an unfair and unfit person to be
a Judge, and he (Henley) wanted a ruling
as to whether or not tbe defense was lim
ited to the matters incorporated in the
circular. The paper offered in evidence
was an affidavit by an attorney in the
White case, who complained that the
Judge had been guilty of unfair conduct.
Mr. Foote, in a very angry manner,
sprang to his feet and said that the paper
had been got up by a disgruntled attor
ney in the White case. "It is not fair; it
is not decent, to offer that record," he
addf-d.
"Oh, pshaw 1" exclaimed Mr. Henley, in
a tone of contempt; "I don't care what
you say."
"I don't care, either," retorted Mr.
Foote, hotly.
Both men were flushed and angry.
Judge Hebbard looked annoyed, and there
is no knowing what might have happened
had not the court interrupted the gentle
men with a call to order.
The court would not allow the paper in
evidence, and the defense announced that
their case was closed.
The prosecution placed Judge Hebbard
on the stand in reoutial. The Judge be
gan by saying, "I wish to say that I aid
everything that I could â " when he was
interrupted by Mr. Henley with the objec
tion that tne Judge's testimony should De
eived by way of question and answer.
The witness proceeded tc say that At
torney-General Hart called upon him with
a complaint in a suit on behalf of the
People of the State of California, on the re
lation or the Attorney-General against the
People's Home Savings Bank, asking that
the bank be declared unsafo for further
continuance in business, and requested a
decree of the court to put it into liquida
tion under the banking act.
The Attorney-General on that occasion
advised Judge Hebbard that he had no
doubt that the appointment of a receiver
was proper, and that-it was a case of great
urgency.
Objection was raised to this conversa
tion by the defense.
The witness then narrated how he took
the papers from the Attorney-General,
and how tbe Attorney-General named a
certain man as receiver who is not con
nected with this case. Then Judge Heb
bard informed General Hart that he had
never mude a mistake since he had been
on the bench in the appointment of offi
cers of the court, and that he proposed to
appoint as receiver, not the person named
by" General Hart, but General John F.
Sheehan, a gentleman with whom he, the
witness, was well acquainted, and in
whose capability and integrity the wit
ness had unbounded confidence. He had
appointed General Sheehan, be said, as a
commissioner in the case of Emeric vs.
Alvarado. a case that bad been pending
for twenty-seven years, and in two years
General b'heehan and his fellow-commis
sioners wound up the case.
The witness did not recommend James
Alva Watta3 General Sheehan's attorney,
but he Jiad approved of tne appointment
afterward. He told General Sheehan that
the court might never be in a position to
mafee him any allowance for his services
as receiver. The general said that that
was all right, and that he would like to
appoint Mr. Watt Â»s his attorney. The
witness agreed, and that night General
Sheehan broken into the bank and took
possession of it.
At that time Delmas & Shortridge were
attorneys for tue bank, and the next day
S. M. Shortridee visited the witness in his
chambers and said: "Judge, I wish you
would discharge this receiver and vacate
that injunction. I don't think you have a
right to do this under the law."
The witness refused to do as Mr. Short
ridge had suggested, and the next day Mr.
Delnias came into court and asked Judge
Hebbard orally to do the same thing that
Mr. Shortridge had asked. The witness
said :
"Mr. Delmas, I refused Mr. Shortridge
already doing this, exparte, but if you
will file a paper I will tive you an order
to show cause. Mr. Delmas said, a little
testily, 'I don't want your order.'
"Some days afterward there was an
order to show cause in this matter," con
tinued the witness. "Before that was
heard, Mr. McCarthy and Mr. Hutton, I
believe, did come into my chambers; I
don't know whether any one else was
present or not. We had a general talk
about getting a new board of directors that
would be satisfactory to everybody. After
ward Mr. Dfllraas came in, and we had a
good deal of discussion about it, and I did
promise that I would modify tbe injunc
tion so t. at the old directors might resign
and a new board might be appointed, if
all the parties would agree.
"There was an attempt on the part of.
everybody to get a new board of directors
of that bank. Mr. Hightcn represented
three directors and vtockholders, Mr.
Watt re resented some other stockholders,
and McCarthy and Hutton represented
some depositors. Between the Bth and
11th of June we were trying to decide
upon a new board of directors, but the
parties there in court never could agree
upon a board of seven directors. The
seven directors of tbe old board were rep
resented in court. J. H. Durst represented
Dr. Bouchey; Mr. Hishton represented
Graves, Jenkins and Montgomery; and
Delmas & Shortruffee repreÂ«entod Mc-
Donald and others. V Imas & Shortridge
had a number of new men for this direc
tory, and when their names were pro
posed Mr. Durst objected to the personnel,
and Mr. Highton also in a way objected.
Then Mr. Durst had nome names tc pro
pose, and Delmas & Shortridge objected.
Then Mr. Highton asked that the matter
go over until the morning, when ho would
present the nameÂ« of 250 reputable men in
this community, and would read them to
the court and would have all parties agree
that the Judge should mix them up in a
jury-box and draw out seven names, one
by one. who should be declared and
agreed upon as the new board.
"Mr. Highton brought the list the next
day, but nobody would agree to his plan.
Mr. Shortndge and nis clients objected to
it. One day Delmas enme into court and
charged me with having promised un
qualifiedly that I would allow those
directors to resign, and I denied his state
ment and challenged proof."
Mr. Foote, in reply to an objection by
the defense, expressed the opinion that
Judge Hebbard should have fined and im
prisoned Mr. Delmas for contempt, for
telling the court that he had violated his
promises.
"That is sapping the very foundations
of justice," added Mr. Foote, apparently
working himself up into a great passion.
Judge Daingerfield did not appear to be
very much impressed by the remark;
neither did the crowd of depositors in
court, who were thinking of the money
they had put into the People's Home Sav
ings Bank, and who did not appear to be
fretting about the foundations of justice,
sapped or otherwise.
Then the court adjourned until 10
o'clock this rnornine.

Dr. Taylor Advocated a New Charter

The Association of Improvement Clubs
last evening elected officers and then pro
ceeded to consider suggestions regarding
legislation which might oe procured
affecting directly the interests of San
Francisco. Mayor-elect Phelan, president
of the association, declined to be consid
ered a candidate for re-election and the
election resulted as follows:
President. George R. Fktcher; first vice
president, John H. Gray; second vice
president, C. D. Salfield; recording secre
tary, P. Schwartz; corresponding secre
tary, J. G. Maloney ; treasurer. F. W. M.

incumbent. William Metzner and W. L.
Williamson were elected members of the
credentials and finance committees re
spectively, Messrs. McEwen and Maguire
having refused. The other members of
the committees remained.
Prior to the election of officers the Polk
street Improvement Club was admitted to
membership. Several matters were con
sidered. The secretary was instructed to
send a communication to the Board of
Health in reference to the open sewer in
Sanchez and Liberty streets, which is not
far from public schools which have been
closed on account of diphtheria. The law
committee was authorized to recommend
an ordinance to the Supervisors to pro
hibit objectionable trades and occupations
within certain limits. This was brought
about by a discussion concerning greders'
camps.
The special order of the evening was the
discussion of possible legislative measures.
Sena^r Dwyer spoke about the Pest
house location, and it was voted that it
should be located outside of San Fran
cisco.
The committee on laws was instructed
to communicate with Judge Hunt pre-
Earatory to drawing a bill in reference to

Senator rjraunhart made a little speech
favoring the restoration of the veto power
of the Mayor; favoring also a law to pre
vert collusion in making assessments for
taxation collusiveiy to favor tax shirkers;
also condemning the multiplication of
offices, expressing the opinion that four
Police Judges were too many and that an

! â¢ '-SACRAMENTO, Cm*. Dec. 2.â The soul
: .- 6f the fruit-grower was eleyated by music
;. â¢ ifi-night and his heart warmed with the
â¢ : amenities of a social reception tendered
7 : him and his wife and daughters and son 3
By'the hpspitable people of Sacramento,
â¢ â¢who are adding each year to the State
â¢.capital's reputation for extending the
' gJad .hand to all comers. The reception
:' was in the Senate chamber and in charge
" -of a.reception committee of the Chamber
â  o( Commerce, comprising R. D. Stephens,
. J; O. Coleman and J. A. Woodson. Hon.
â E. D. McCabe officiated as high chief and
: .'Bs M. Lelong did all the hard work as
â  â¢ deputy marshal, the chief marshal3nip
. honors going to Russ Stephens. Part of
the hard campaign waged during the
evening by Deputy Field Marshal Lelong
was to lift up Frank A. Kimball in the
rear of the hall and carry him bodily to
the front to maKe a speech.
The speechmaking part â of the pro
' gramme was very informal and humorous.
Among those who made short speeches
wereex-SenatorWilliam Johnson, Richard
lryine, Major Berry, President Elwood
Cooper, Rev. A. C. Herriok, pastor of the
Baptist church of Sacramento, and J. A.
' Filcher of San Francisco. Dancing was
â¢indulged in and light refreshments were
served. Souvenirs, consisting of pictures
of all the State capitol buildings of the
State, were distributed. Many State offi
cers and ladies and gentlemen of Sacra
mento were present.
The second day's session of the fruit
growers' convention came to order at 10
o'clock this morning with President El
wood Cooper in the chair. The business
opened with the reading of an entertain
ing and valuable paper by Manager and
Secretary J. A. Filcher of the State Board
of Trade at San Francisco on the "Distri
bution of fruits and the opening of new
markets." He said California has one
million acres of land suitable for the cul
tivation of high grade tobacco. He advo
cated keeping up the standard of the
brands of California fruit. California
can produce the fruit luxuries. He did
not approve of the abolition of middle
men provided there were not too many ot
them, and he did not think it practicable
for the fruit-growers to establish stores in
large cities, and neglect their orchards to
give attention to a business they know
nothing about. He heartily indorsed toe
â¢ proposition to send out traveling agents.
"Send them into all the markets of the
world; send them out over the earth hy
the hundreds." He advocated sending
out the best recipes for preparing Califor- 1
ma dried fruits.
California fruit ousht to be exhibited at
the Hamburg (Germany horticultural Ex
position, which begins next May and con
tinues rive months, and he proposed that
the State make an appropriation. "Mid
dlemen fixing prices will continue till the
â fruit-growers combine to stop it. One
firm in Chicago practically controls the
walnut trade of California. The devil
must be fought with fire,'' he concluded.
Leonard Coates of Napa followed with a
paper on the eeneral subject of disposing
of fruit and reaching English markets.
He said W. H. Miils had pointed out the
benefit and advantage of open free mar
kets. He said he thought there had been
tnore haste in pushing quantity rather
than quality, and in trying to get the first
car of fruit to Chicago. He inquired what
had been the benefit of experimental and
spasmodic shipments to foreign markets,
and then answered by saying the result
was very low prices, owing to the lack of
doing business on business principles.
In London a demand for new articles
must be created before the merchants will
handle them. He proposes getting Cali
fornia fruits into the army and navy and
the great civil service stores. To ship
poor grades of fruit to London would be
to condemn California fruit for all fime.
He advocated the establishment of general
agents, who should be reputable business
tpen of financial standing in London,
i ' Vice-President William Johnston advo
cated the support of a pure-food bill, as
California products were being counter
feited, and he said he did not know but
tii.it some Californians were lending as
sistance to the nefariou* business.
Mr. Gordon of San J#se stated that he
knew of a packing, firm in San Franciscj
which imported a poor quality of Turkisn
prunes and sent them put as California
prunes.
Mr. Filcher srjoke in favor of organiza
tion of fruit-growers in all fruit-growing
sections. This would reverse the situation
and bring a profit. He moved that it be
the sense of this convention for the fruit
growers in all sections to organize and
stand together for the good of one and all.
E. K. Alsip of Sacramento seconded the
motion and spoke in favor of organization.
He said that the commission men are
getting rich and the fruit-growers poorer.
Professor C. H. Allen of San Jose said
he thought organization would be a good
thing and he believed in pushing it along,
ijut doubted that it could be accom
plished, basing his conclusion on the ex
' perience of fruit-growers in the vicinity of
Kan f Jose.
Discussion and the reading of papers
were discontinued at tcis time, and the
report of the committee appointed yester
day to prepare a memorial to Congress on
the necessity of increasing the tariff on
fruit, nuts, olives, etc., was received. It
was read by the committee's chairman,
, General N. P. Chipmau of Re.d Bluff.
The memorial asks for a tariff of 20
cents per gallon on olives green or pre
pared; olive oil, not lesÂ» than $1 ppr gal
lon; raisins, including currants and other
seedless raisins, 2y z cents per pound; al
monds, 6 cents )er pound for unsholled
and 10 cents for shelled; English walnuts,
3. cenls per pound tor unshelled and (j
cents for shelled; prunes and plums, 2^
cents per pound ; figs, 3 cents per pound ;
comfits, sweetmeats, preserved iruits, etc.,
40 per cent; oranges, lemons and Jimes, 20
cents per cubic loot and when in bulk not
less than $2 50 per tnousand ; citric acid.
10 cents per pound; essential oils ot
oranges and lemons, 50 cents per pound.
Some difference of opinion was ex
pressed as to asking for a 2% cent or a 3
cent duty on raisins, but it was decided by
an ample majority on a vote that 2% cents
lsenougn to ask for.
The report or memorial was adopted by
the convention mid resolutions were
adopted directins the printing of the me
morial, its distribution to each member of
the present and the new Congress, and
requesting the co-operation of California
members in Congress at all times.
At the afternoon meeting the conven
tion first listened to a report of the com
mittee on "co-operation 1 ' by Chairman
Russ Stephens. He reported a manifest
indisposition on the part of some fruit
growers to act together and the inability
of others to do so, owing to low prices of
products through the system of consign
ing, and having; become financially em
barrassed to the extent of mortgaging
their real estate and crops to commission
men, yrho demand and arrogate to them
selves the control of disposing of products.
The commission men have used the fruit
thus controlled to glut and demoralize the
market.
In consideration of these facts the com
mittee lelfthat any attempt at present to
form a perfect and compact central or
State organization, that would reflect the
sentiments of the great mass of the fruit
growers, would prove a failure. Local co
operation was recommended by the com
mittee, to sell their products through
their own agents. As an illustration of
tne success of this plan, the local fruit
growers' organization of.Santa Clara Val
ley was cited. Action on this report was
deferred till later in the day.
E. F. Adams of Wrights energetically
read a paper on r 'The Feasibility of Estab
lishing a Free Market in San Francisco."
This, he said, would give the growers of
the entire State the benefits now enjoyed
by the river shippers. He said the mar
ket would be of most benefit to the small
grower.
It must be expected that the river
steamer lines, having the advantage at
present, would attempt to defeat a free
market, but the railroad lines would favor
it. Every opportunity should be afforded
for competition between steamers and
railroads. It would be necessary, he
thought, for the State Harbor Commission
to have more power in order to provide
more shedroum on the water front. The
Southern Pacific favors a free market.
Stalls should be rented and the market
conducted fairly to all. He recommended
getting the California Fruit Exchange,
the San Francisco Fruit Exchange and
other commercial organizations of San
Francisco together on the subject. Legis
lation was recommended.
F. M. Righter of Campbells gave a talk
on "Markets and Marketing of Dried
Fruits." He was antagonistic to com
mission men. He said the growers do
everything to increase the supply without
doing anything to increase the demand,
he told all the market troubles of the
fruit-erower, but offered no solution.
P. N. Motheral said that not a pound of
fruit had gone out of Kings County this
year not sold, and the commission men
wno formerly had the business are not
happy.
"Advertising Fruit Products in Foreign
Markets" was tne subject of a talk by H.
P. Stabler of Yuba City. He said he
thought handling fruit through exchanges
is not feasible nor practicable and is a fail
ure. He thought the best plan is to let
the middlemen alone entirely, and organ
ize a corporation to dispose of fruit prod
ucts and deal directly with the business
men. He proposed a board of directors
composed of four fruit-growers and three
dealers who should be business men. He
proposed advertising in fairs, food shows
and expositions all over the country, and
the placing of traveling men on the road.
He stated that he had been unable to
get dried prunes in a leading restaurant
in San Jose for breakfast; they didn't
have them at all. "Think of it," he said.
"Could not get prunes in a San Jose res
taurant. Now, if we can't get them at
home, how can we expect to get them
abroad?" He said it was time that the
growers did something along this line;
they had met year after year and done
nothing. He proposed the organization
of a company with a capital stock of
$240,000.
"Transportation and Freight Rates on
Green and Dried Fruits" was the subject
of the paper of W. B. Gester of Newcastle.
In some figures which he presented it was
shown that the railroads "take 51 per cent
and other charges enough more to leave
the fruit-producer only 24 per cent of the
price.
He thought that ultimate relief would
come in the line of legislation that would
reorganize railroads and prevent them
Iron; taking the major part of the money
from the producer. He did not think it
was of any use to argne longer with the
railroads; make the best of it, and deal
with a new set of men altogether.
Edward Barham of Montereyltalked on
"Transportation." The main idea oi his
talk was that the construction of tne
Panama canal would be a great thing not
only for the fruit-growers of California by
bringing them thousands of miles nearer
the great markets of this and the Old
world, but to every interest on the Pacific
Coast. It would in many ways soivo the
problem of transportation for California.
He exhibited maps showing the canal and
the mileage it would save.
Further discussion was favorable to the
Nicaragua canal, and the convention ad
journeu when it was too late to see by day
light, making the question oj effecting a
permanent organization of fruitgrowers
the special order for to-morrow atternoon
at 2 o'clock.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 3, 1896.
GIRL KIDNAPED
FROM STOCKTON
Chinatown Is Thrown Into
Spasms of Excite
ment.
Mrs, Culbertson of San Francisco
Performs a Mission of
Humanity.
Rescues a Celestial Maiden From the
Grasp of a Doctor, Who
Sought to Wed Her.
STOCKTON, Cal., Dec. 2.â Local China
town was thrown into a wild fever of ex
citement this afternoon by tne supposed
kidnaping of a Chinese girl by Miss Cul
bertson of the Chinese Mission in San
Francisco, in which she was aided by the
police. The Chinese residents on El Do
rado street, near Washington, were sur
prised to see a hack drive rapidly up to
the drugstore of Dr. Ma Tosa Ting and a
well-dressed woman alight. A young girl
came but from the store and had a hurried
conversation with tbe lady, then disap
peared in the place, coming out a few
minutes later and entered the hack, which
was rapidly driven away. The proceed
ings were so sudden that Dr. Ting at first
could not comprehend them and he left
the store to gather his friends and prevent
the Wight of the girl. When he returned
with his clan, however, the prize had
flown.
Ting sought the aid of Lee Yuen, a court
interpreter, and they reported the matter
to the police, who knew of the details of
the flight beforehand.
The back containing Mrs. Culbertson
and-* the girl was driven to the Sacra
mento-street depot, but soon a throng of
Chinamen, headed by Dr. Ma Tosa Ting,
appeared on the scene, and the two fled,
taking another back, in which they were
driven to French Camp, about five miles
south of here, and caught the San Fran
cisco train, there eluding their pursuers.
The girl who was taken away is the
daughter of a woman who used to live
with Dr. Ma Tosa Ting, but died some
time ago. The girl came here about three
months ago at the solicitation of Ting,
who soon set about to gain her hand ia
marriage. The girl was well known to
the Chinese Mission in San Francisco,
and when she saw Ting's designs wrote to
Mrs. Culbertson. The lady arrived here
yesterday, and upon inquiring of Chief of
Police Kingsbury found her whereabouts.
The girl was perfectly willing to go, al
though Ting maintains that she was kid
naped. He telephoned to friends in San
Francisco to shadow the lady on her ar
rival there, and left himself to-night for
the metropolis.
ADJUSTING STOCKTON CLAIMS.
Valley Road Managers Keep ' the Prom-
ises Made to Property-
Owners.
STOCKTON, Cal., Dec. 2. â Several
months ago the property-owners on Tay
lor street, along which the Valley road
runs, entered a protest against the high
embankment raised by the road in the
middle of the street which impeded other
traffic and greatly deteriorated the value
of their land. Ihey were assured by Vice-
President Watt and Solicitor-General Pres
ton, at a meeting held in the rooms of tbe
Commercial Association, that equitable
settlements for damages "would be made
with all the claimants. Some of the more
hot-headed among them were bent on
forcing matters and were anxious to bring
suits for heavy damages.
C. S. Young, the right-of-way agent of
the Valley road, has arrived here for the
purpose of settling all these claims ami
demonstrating that the managers of the
road intend to keep all the promises made
by them to the people of Stockton. Some
of the most violent against the road now
regret that they were bent on hasty ac
tion. All claims will now be satisfied, and
the people of Stockton will have more
faith in the Valley road than ever.

FALLER ROSE HUMOUS.
Morton Special Delivery to Handle Its
liagrjage nnd Expreaa Jiusineaa.
STOCKTON, Cal., Dec. 2.â lt is reported
in transportation circles here that the sup
posed agreement between the River Ex
press Company and the Valley road for
the handling of baggage and express busi
ness on the new line has been declared off
altogether and that a new rival has found
favor in the Morton Special Delivery Com
pany of San Francisco. Until a few days
ago it was conceded that tbe River Ex
press Company, whose head offices are
located here, would have the contract,
and that Wells, Fargo & Co. would not be
considered. It is now learned that Traffic
Manager Moss, while here a few days ago,
stated that the River Express Company
was out of the Question, and hinted that
the Morton Special Delivery Company
would get the valley road's business, and
it is understood that arrangements to that
elfect have been proferred to the Calif ronia
Navigation and Improvement Company,
which is handling all the road's freight
between here and San Francisco.

pealed damage suit of Thomas Lyngren o(.
San Francisco against the California Nav
igation and Improvement Company for
alleged unwarranted ejection from one of
their boats on July 4, 1894, was to-day de
cided by Judge Budd in favor of the de
fendant corporation. The question upon
which the trial hinged was that of Lyn
green's sobriety at the time of his alleged
ejectment, several witnesses testifying
that the plaintiff was intoxicated. The

plaintiff was in that condition and that a
company had a right to refuse an objec
tionable person transportation. Lyngreen

MEXICAN TOWNS
IN A HURRICANE
Pochutla, Huatulco and
Their Surroundings
in Ruins.
Four Lives Lost by Flying
Wreckage and Raging
Streams.
Devastation of Ccff;e Plantations Com*
p'.ete, the Loss Being Estimated
at $500,000.
SAN DIEGO. Cal., Dec. 2.â The towns
of Pochutla and Huatulco, in the State of
Oaxsica, Mexico, were visited by a tre
mendous hurricane on the night of No
vember 11, and serious damage was done
in the towns and on the coffee plantations
surrounding them.
So far as known, only four Jives were
lost. Enrique Leon and nis brother Fede
rico, owners of a fine finca four leagues
from Huatuico, were killed by the falling
walls of their adobe house, and their fore
man, Gregorio Machado, was killed in the
patio, where he had run to escape, by
holding on to tbe roots of an orange tree.
Near Pochutla a woman was drowned in
the San Andreas River while attempting to
cross to her children, who were huddled
on the opposite bank in tbe ruins of their
home.
The settlements around Pochutla and
Huatulco include thritty German and
Scotch colonies, and immense sums have
been expended in setting out coffee plan
tations.
The storm wrought fearful havoc among
the tender orchards, on some tineas com
pletely destroying the labor of the past
three years, and leaving the land barren
of crops as well as houses. In the neigh
borhood of Pochutia alone nearly 500,000
trees were set out. Guido Richter leading
on the Alemania finca with 125,000 trees,
and Leo yon Brandenstein being next
with 110,000. On the former plantation
ten houses were blown down and 50,000
trees destroyed. On the latter place all
the houses of the Mozos were swept away
and they were left homeless in the storm.
On the finca El Yschil, owned by A. C. M.
Machair, tbe ranchhouse was blown down,
the warehouse destroyed and most of the
crops deluged with water and sand, which
was a rivsr during the storm, and left a
bed of sand in the middle of the formerly
fertile land.
All the houses occupied by the Mozos
were blown down, except two, and trees
of all kinds flew through the air. On
some ranches where the trees were not de
stroyed great loss resulted from tbe shak
ing down of berries. Samuel Lederer's
finca Camila suffered severely in this
manner, and the finca Carmen, owned by
D. L. Crawford of Edinburgh, suffered in
the loss of coffee berries and in the de
struction of crops already harvested.
Smeaton Bros., owners of tne San Andreas
ranch, lost heavily in trees blowing down,
houses demolished and covering of coffee
lands by sand.
Tbe country after the storm looked
desolate in the extreme, roads having
been destroyed, houses disappeared, trees
torn up and the face o( the country seamed
with great gullies. The loss to the
growers can only be estimated wildly, but
it is thought that it will reach $503,000.
SEATTLE RAILWAY SALE.
The Consolidated System Bought at Auc-
tion by a Representative of the
Bondholders.
SEATTLE. Wash., Dec. 2.â By virtue of
first mortgage bondholders proceedings
the Seattle Consolidated Street Railway,
consisting of about thirty-five miles of
electric street railway in this city, was
sold to-day to Judge Thomas Burke, rep
resenting the bondholders, for $139,601.
There was a total indebted ness-of about
$600,000 against tho property.
The affair results in the financial col
lapse of D. T. Denny, who prior to 1893
was estimated to be worth $3,000,000. Tn
that year he sought to get control of tne
entire street railway system of Seattle â
about seventy miles all told. He would
probably have succeeded but for the great
panic, which found him in debt more than
$2,000,000. In order to prevent his broth
er's business ruin an effort was made to gel
A. A. Denny, the founder of Seattle, to go
to D. T.Â« assistance, but he declined to
do so.
The sale of this great property was
conducted by Master-in-Chancery Eben
Smith, under the direction of the Federal
court. It was put up several times, but
the purchasers were not on hand. Judge
Hanford decided that the property should
bring no less than $120,000, an amount
sufficient to pay $80,000 of receiver's cer
tificates and other outstanding claims, in
cluding a judgment for $16,000 in favor of
Annie M. Sears for personal injuries sus
tained five years ago. This action was
carried twice to the Supreme Court of the
â¢State and once to the Circuit Court of
Appeals.
Judge Burke represented more partic
ularly Henry S. Boutelie, N. W. Harris,
Albert Chester, H. W. Bartol and Allen
Forbes, Eastern capitalists, constituting
the reorganization committee of first
morteage bondholders. Lawyer Will H.
Thompson, representing W. H. Vincent,
a Spokane capitalist, bid $120,000 for the
property. But for ihe insistence of Judge
Hanford that the Sears judgment should
be protected it is said that the property
would have been bought in for a nominal
figure, as all the receiver's certificates are
reported to be held by ths stockholders of
the road.
CLEAR LAKE ELECTRIC ROAD.
Meeting Held at Vallejo and a Working
Committee Appointed.
VALLEJO, Cal., Dec. 2â The meeting
at the Cit^ Hall last evening to listen to
the promoters of the Clear Lake Electric
Road, from Clear Lake with a terminal at
Vallejo, filled the council chamber with
representative citizens. The meeting was
presided over by City Trustee J. A.
Browne.
Colonel O. E. Moore, promoter of the
enterprise, was introduced and in a clear
manner presented the idea and pros
pectus of the project. He was followed
by Mr. Elder of the Westinghouse Elec
tric Company, who presented data, con
vincing in regard to the success of the
electrical energy and transmission of
sufficient electrical motor-power for all
purposes for future demands of the city.
Rev. Mr. Wylie of Napa City stated
that all assurances for the finances re
quested as a subsidy from Lake and Napa
counties were secure. Citizens of Vallejo
spoke in an assuring manner of further
ing the project in every wav on behalf of
the city. Considerable interest was
aroused and a committee of eleven citi
zens was appointed to further the project
and consult with the projectors.
I The committee appointed was J. A, Mc

STOCKTON-SIERRA LINE.
Belief That the Proposed Railway
Will Soon Be Built.
STOCKTON, Cal., Dec. 2.â There seems
to be no doubt in the minds of the people
here that the Sierra Pacific road will be
pushed tp an early completion. One of
the passengers who arrived by boat from
San Francisco this morning was Mr. Bul
lock, the representative of the New York
Development Company, which is back of
the scheme to run a railroad from this
city into the mining region on the western
slope of the Sierras. The line for the pro
posed roaa has been run as far as Bellota,
in this county, going by way of "Waterloo,
bnt the people of Linden are anxious for
the route to be changed so as to touch
their town, or at any rate come much
nearer it than is now contemplated.
Shortly after his arrival Mr. Bullock and
P. A. Biiell, vice-president of the road,
left by carriage for a trip along the route,
and also to visit Linden and ascertain
what progress, if ;my, Is being made by
the people there toward securing rights
of way to that town.

D. C. Shaw'a Sudden Demiae.
HEALDSBURG, Cal., Dec. 2. â The
residents of Healdsburg were deeply
shocked to-day by the sudden death oi
Mrs. A. D. C. Shaw, one of the mo3t prom
inent and highly respected women in the
community. The lady W3s making a so
cial call oh a friend and in the midst of

M. E. church for over forty years. Mrs.
Shaw was also an active and prominent
member of the W. C. T. IL, had held the
office of president and was treasurer of the
local branch of that organization at the
time of her demise. In her passing away
this community has lost a truly worthy,
noble woman.
ILI-ECILLEWARK EXPLOSION.
Two Minera Torn to Pieces by a Dia-
charge of Dynamite.
PORTLAND, Or., Dec. 2.â H. L. Lover
ing of Hood River received the following
brief letter from Illecillewart, B. C, to
day:
"We have had a terrible accident here,
in which one of your old citizens, Charles
Berger, met a swift and awful death. Mr.
Berger and Chris Miller went out about
nine miles from here to do some work in a
mine which is being opened up. They
were last seen on Monday, November 19.
There were ten three- pound boxes of dy
namite in the cabin. A heavy shot was
heard that evening at dusk. On Wednes
day the cabin was found blown to atoms.
Parties have been out almost all the time
since, and have succeeded in finding parts
of the body of Milier. but nothing has
been found that can be identified as part
of Mr. Berger. The family is with us
here, and they are bearing up bravely in
their terrible trouble."
FISALIA ELECTION CONTENT.
An Illegal Tote Affecting the Result for
Supervisor.
VISALIA, Cal., Dec. 2.â Much interest
was aroused here to-day in the election
contest case of M. W. Smith v?. J. W.
Thomas, the former contesting the elec
tion of the latter for Supervisor. Lycur
gus D. Whitt, an illegal voter, was called
as a witness for the contestant, he having
told a number of his friends that he had
voted for Thomas, and as Thomas came
out of the canvass of ballots only one vote
ahead of Smith, Whitt's evidence wan
important. On the stand Whitt refused
to answer the question, "For whom did
yon vote for Supervisor ?'' Judge Gray
ordered him to answer and he still refused.
\Vhitt was then ordered confined in the
County Jail till he would answer. Whitt
vows lie will never g'vein. He has a wife
and several small children in the mount
tains.
SHOOTING AT HANDSRERG.
.JoJm -F. Davit Stortalltf Wounded in a
Crap Oame Jiotc.
BAKERSFIELD, Cal., Dec. 2.â Last
night Frank Stevens shot and mortally
wounded John F. Davis at Randsburg.
Davis' relatives are reported to live in
Sacramento. It seems that Davis and
another party had some tronble in the
new building erected fora theater over a
crap game. Davis went out after his gun
and came back, when Frank Stevens, son
of Y. R. Stevens, formerly of San BÂ»rnar
dino, interfered and a scuffle ensued during
which Stevens shot Davis through the
body. Davis was not dead at last report,
but was expected to die at any time.
Deputy Sheriff Crawford took charge of
Stevens and disarmed him. He then
started for Kramer to catch a train and
take his prisoner to jail at Bakersfield.

SPOKANE, Wash., Dec. 2.â Al Phelps,
a gambler, well known in the West as the
former owner of the racehorse Rollie Pol
lie, committed suicide yesterday at the
Grand Hotel by taking morphine. Phelps
has been in town about two weeks. He
met a number of friends here, and though
he was without money he asked them for
nothing and would not tell them of his
trotibles. Monday night he played cards
with several men about town until an
early hour of the morning, when he re
turned to the hotel. Not having been
seen next day, his room was entered and
he was found dead. His relatives are not
known.

IMITATION COFFEE.
The Name Not Fancied by Postum
Cereal Company,
;.-'. Coffee drinkers may be interested to
know the opinion of some competent phy-
sicians in regard to the use of Postum, the
grain drink, in place of coffee. Let it be
nnderstood that the manufacturers do not
decry the use of coffee by healthy persons,
but there is a _ great army of intelligent
men and women of the present day who
cannot stand the steady, daily poison of
coffee, tobacco and whisky without feeling
the effect in some serious bodily derange-
ment.
Dr. F. P. Cassady, editor of the Medical
Argus, Minneapolis,* Minn., writes, inclos-
ing tbe money for a third case, and is kind
enough to add: "I fully coincide with'
your views in regard to the use of Coffee
and tobacco by neurasthenics (nervous
patients). I am using Postum every day-
ami am greatly pleased with it."
- A great many people who are not keenly
sensitive in their coffee, tastes state that
Po3tura ' tastes so much Like coffee that
they uo not notice tne difference when it
is served at their breakfast.
The makers do not claim, however, that
it has* exactly the same taste as the finest
coffee. . . ' "
:: It nas exactly tbe same color and is
just as piquant and pungent in its taste as
the finest Mocha coffee, but the taste is â¢
distinct and belongs to Postum alone. /' â¢
It is made by the Postum Cereal Com-'
pany, limited, of Battle Creek, Mich., and
is not an imitation of any drink, but
stands on its own footing as a wonderfully .
palatable and delicious table drink, thor-
oughly healthful and nourishing, and is
made strictly of the grains. It is impossi-
ble for any one to judge of the perfection
of the product without a careful personal
test of it. *
There are thousands of people using
Postum, the health coffee, in place of cof-
fee, and who have been benefited in their
health to an extent that commands their
esteem and warm friendship lor Postum.
Wily grocers sometimes work in cheap
imitations of Postum Cereal coffee if the
customer will stand it. , .. . â¢

engaged in working about the ship, which
â¢the captain admitted was in need of re
: pairs before they could continue on their
..â jour-iey.
The parly of aeronauts were well sup
plied with provisions, aud soon after land
ing 'began preparations for a meal and
; cordially invited the two fishermen to
join them, which invitation was accepted.
Shortly . afterward Valinziano and his
companions began making preparations
to return to this city, but were urged by
the captain to remain, that repairs would
.soon. bo made and they could see the air-
shij> launched. The captain was very ur
'. gÂ«nt' in his request for them to remain,
. aind-finally prevailed upon them to do so,
but later .in the afternoon he informed
. them that it would be impossible to cora

cension that night.

the aeronauts was to detain him until it

covery before the airship had resumed its
flight. One of the party, an elderly man
and slightly de#f, who seemed to be the
machinist of the ship's crew, was ad
dres&ed by bis companions as Stewart.
Vajinziano is able to give but a slight de
scription of the ship, as he was not allowed
to approach closer than fifty feet, but says
it appeared to be easily sixty feet in length
and cigar-shaped, with a steering appa
Â«ratu.--, the latter being the part on which
repairs were being made.
The ship was constructed of some lighl
colored material, and from the vagnc de
scription ot the machinery, most of which
is concealed, the motive power is thought
to be electricity..
Large wings, of which there are a great
many, were closely folded against the side
of the ship. The two fishermen got
starter: on their homeward trip about 4
p. m., and, having contrary tides to con
tend with, did not reach this city until 10
P. m.
Ax first his fellow-fishermen were in
clined to make light of bis story, and
thought him a victim of hallucination, but
Valinziano is anything but visionary, and
is well known as a moat reliable and in
telligent man, and there is no doubt but
that he is stating facts.
iÂ«K Call correspondent has arranged
to leave here at daylight in company with
VaJinziano as guide, and visit the spot
where the aeronauts made their camp.
Wnile it is probable they have long since
taken flieht, they mast have left some in

Colonel Chase of the Nadeau denied

THEY- SAW AN AIRSHIP.
Flve Men Near Tulare Lake Wit
nessed Its Remarkable
Flight.
A-ccording to the written statement of
five men of Watertown, Fresno County,
tbe airship passed over that part of the
State in its flight to the northward. Gen
eral Hart ol this City, the attorney for the
inventor, a wees or so aeo stated that the
aeronaut proposed to take his airship into
the higher and lighter atmosphere of the
southern part of the State.
Since then hundreds of people in Los
Angeles and along the route have seen
lights tiiat convinced them that they bad
seen the illuminated evidence of a ship of
the sky.
From the later accounts the vessel must
nave started upon its return trip about
the last day of November, as shown by
the following letter sent from Watertown:
Watertown, Fresno County. Cal.. I

Editor Morning Call, San Francisco, Catâ
Dear Sib: An airship of greiu magnitude
passed over our town this evening at 8:45.
The light first appeared about ten miles
south of here in the vicinity of Tulare Lake,
and passed directly over the postoffice build
ing, which is located near the southwest cor
ner of section 11â19â19. M. D. M., and disap
peared to the northward, in the direction of
Mendcta. The elevation at this point seemed
to De about 400 feet, although at times it ap
proached much nearer the earth. The light
was intensely brilliant as it approached. Af
ter passing, the form of the ship and the pro
pelling apparatus was plainly discernible
against the clear sky. Human forms could be
distinctly seen, but no intelligible utterance
could be heard.
We would not hazard an opinion as to the
rate of speed, but would say not less than fif
teen miles an hour.

SACRAMENTO, Cal., Dec 1. â Since
the publication of the airship items from
various portions of the State in The Call
it has leaked out that some of the most
responsible people in this city saw a
strange object in the clouds on the after
noon preceding the first public sight of
the mysterious searchlight in this city.
They claim that this object was at such
an enormous height that they were una
ble to plainly distinguish its form, but
also say that when it turned they caught
the glint or shine as of a metallic object,
and that frequently sheets of paper would
slowly flutter earthward as though the
occupants were castine them out for the
purpose of ascertaining whether their
vehicle was approaching or receding from
the earth. i
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 3, 1896,
CLUB MEN ARE
NOT UNANIMOUS
Vigorous Protest by Pacific-
Union Members Against
Moving.
The Progressive Faction Will
Stand Firm for the Van
Ness Avenue Site.
Houss and Surroundings in Keeping
With the Wealth and Taste of
the Institution Desired.
The Pacific- Union Club decided at
a meeting of members held last Tuesday
evening to buy the land on the northeast
corner of Bush street and Van Ness
avenue and erect thereon a spacious builds
ing for the exclusive use of the club. Four
per cent twenty-year bonds to the amount
of $25'J,000 have been taken by members
of the club. The lot, 120 feet on the ave
nue and 127 ieet on Bush street, will cost
$38,000. The estimated cost of the build
ing is $150 000. President Hopkins has
been autuorized by resolution of the mem
bers to appoint a building committee to
consult architects and secure plans for
the proposed edifice.
While the proposition to move the club
from its present home on Union square
has been discussed for months very many
of the active memoers who p-id not favor
the plan fancied that the money required
would not be raised by bond subscriptions.
To them the action of the meeting in de
ciding in favor of the move was a sur
prise, although a decisive majority of the
120 members attending supported the en
terprise.
In the club there is a strong progressive
element composed of young men who
have mcxiern notions of club advancement.
Thtsy are re-enforced by capitalists and
others of advanced years and experience
who hold firmly to the opinion that the
club should Le something more ihan a
downtown lounging and dining establish
ment. They maintain that the Pacific-
Union, representing so much wealth and
embracing within its membership so many
of the influential merchants, bankers and
professional men of the City, should get
in line with the advanced clubs of Lon
don, New York and Boston and build a
house of its own. They do not regard it
as good form or good policy to live longer
in a rented bouse dowmown, but assert
that the true line of club development in
a style worthy of San Francisco demands
the ciub ownership and occupancy of a
fine building on Van Ness avenue. The
decision in favor of buying the land on
the avenue is therefore regarded as a great
triumph tor the up-to-date element of the
institution.
There is another element in the club
which was very active yesterday. Its
representatives held frequent conferences
during the day with members who did
not attend the meeting Tuesday evening,
The leaders of the non-progressive faction
assert that the location of the clubhouse
on the avenue will disrupt the organiza
tion. They contend that the voice of the
majority has uot been expressed and that
should the proposed plan of departure be
executed naif of the members would re
main and occupy the house on Union
square.
One member, who is firmly opposed to
moving, said yesterday: "You can be
sure that a most vigorous protest against
the move will be tiled and every effort
will be exerted to cause the ciub to reverse
its action."
In other clubs the new departure of the
Pacific-Union is regarded as a proper step.
It is thought to be only a question of time
when the Bohemian Ciub will be com
pelled to abandon its quarters on Grunt
avenue and Post street tor a home farther
west, near the fine residence quarter. A
clubman who has made a study of the
subject in other cities said: "Clubs are
now divided into two classes â the social
club and the lunch club. The lunch club
will always be near the business center of
the city, easily accessible to its members.
The social dub, with some pretensions to
permanency and with ideas of accumulat
ing books, pictures, art treasures and club
property generally, cannot thrive in a
purely commercial atmosphere. A club
desiring to attain a certain degree of
grandeur and exclusivenessmust be some
thing more than an eating-house. Club
development in all the great cities proves
the correctness of this proposition. The
Pacific-Union has wealth, aud can afford
grand surroundings. When it goes to
Van Ness avenue and occupies a beautiful
mansion of its own, men of letters, posi
tion and of wealth will give it substantial
support. In the first instance the Cosmos
and Bohemian clubs may gain some new
members from the Pacific-Union, but the
new membership will add nothing but
revenue to the restaurant."
SAW WHITE WATER AHEAD.
Important Testimony Relative to the
Wreck of the San Beaito.
The investigation into the loss of the
steamer San Benito was resumed yester
day before the United States Local In
spectors of Steam Vessels. I. W. Wood,
chief engineer of the wrecked vessel, testi
fied that on the day of the disaster the
steamer was running down the coast from
5 to 12 p. m. at the rate of fifty revolutions.
After 12 o'clock the revolutions were in
creased to fifty-seven, or fnil speed. At
about that time he was awakened by the
shock, and upon arising he found that the
ship was backing. Shortly after the vessel
broke in two. It broke between the en
gine and fire rooms, in the coal bunkers.
Ole Simens, a seaman who was on the
lookout, testified that he was on duty at
midnight. The weather was very thick.
Half an hour after he saw white foam
ahead and took it to be a tide rip, but he
did not say anything, as the fir&t officer
was also looking at it. The first officer
ordered the man at the wheel to put the
wheel to the starboard. The white water
was dead ahead and a short time after
observing it the vessel struck. The Bwell
and the breakers were heavy and the
weather was thick, with some wind.
The sailor saw the Point Arena light
about ten minutes after the steamer
struck. He said that he did not see any
breakers before the vessel hit on the rocks.
In his judgment the engines were going
ahead at mil speed at the time of the
disaster.
P. Doran, master of the steamer Po
mona, described his run up the coast on
that day, and stated that for all he kept
well off the coast while passing Point
Arena and Point Reyes the current set his
vessel several miles toward the shore.
Thomas L. Foster, the quartermaster of
the San Benito, testified that he took the
wheel at 12 o'clock, midnight, at which
time the weather was hazy. After do
scribing the vessel'! course he told of the
officer's command, on seeing the white
foam, to put the wheel to starboard, and
he set it off two points. He did not hear
the breakers before she struck.
The case wili be resumed to-day.

* There is no change in the situation of
the content for the presidency of the Cali
fornia Associated Cycling Clubs as told in
The Call yesterday. The three candi
dates, E, B. Jerome, A. P. Swain and A.
W. Wehe, are doing their best to secure a
plurality of the votes of the sixty odd del
egates, which seem to be about equally
divided thus far. The president-elect will
have the appointment of the chairman of
the road racing board, a plum which
many of the clubs would like to nave.
F. A. McFariand, O. L. Stevens and W.
F. Knapp are expected from the East to
day and will appear at the Velodrome
Saturday.
R. C. Lennie will assist in presenting
the game of royal cycling, a new Eastern
fad of great popularity, at the Velodrome
as soon as necessary preparations can be
made.
CONFERENCE DEFERED.
But the Attorneys for tho Itailroad Com
missioners Will Meet To-Day.
The conference which was to have taken
place yesterday between attorneys for the
Board of Kailroad Commissioners and the
members of the board, iv reference to the
next steps to be taken in the contest with
the Southern Pacific Company, failtd to
occur for several reasons. Of the Railroad
j Commissioners only one went out to the
Attorney-General's office, namely: Com
missioner La Rue. Dr. Stanion was sick
and Commissioner Ciark was in Stockton.
Attorney-General Fitzgerald and Robert
Y. Hayne ol counsel for the Railroad Com
missioners met in the Attorney-General's
office, but the Attorney-General was ill,
and consequently W. W. Foote was called
up.
Attorney-General litzgerald said last
night that it was probable that at least
the three attorneys of the Railroad Com
missioners would come together to-day at
his office. Nothing occurred yesterday to
chanse conditions at all. No steps will
be taken until tbe several points ot attack
have been thoroughly considered in con
sultation.
Robert Y. Hayne said yesterday that
naturally Attorney-General Fitzeerald
will take the leading part in the proceed
ings to ensue. He could not indicate any
new points.
The fact is, althoueh neither of the at
torneys for the Raiiroad Commissioners
wiil talk about jt, that points advanced by
the Attorney-Ueneral in his argument
before Judge McKenna, and which were
not considered by tbe court iv its decision,
will be strongly urged again in the pro
ceedings to ensun.

REBATES CAUSE TROUBLE.
The Treasurer Will Confer With
the City and County
Attorney.
There is prospect of a spirited fight be
tween City Treasurer Widber and Delin
quent Taz Collector Willett over the hold
ing back of the rebate on taxes, for which
property-holders have been clamoring for
weeks past.
At the time Auditor Broderick turned
tbe tax rolls over to Tax Collector Block,
Mr. Willett, who was employed by the
Finance Committee of the Board of Super
visors to collect delinquent taxes, re
quested that body to delay the payment
of the rebates until he could make a list
of the delinquents of former years who
had rebates coming to them this year.
He declared that the board bad the
right to hold out the amount delinquent
from the rebate and on this showing pay
ment was delayed until yesterday. Mr.
Willett admitted that there was only
about $10,000 that was owing to the City
from tho^e entitled to rebates, and yet the
whole amount that is owing tax-payers â
nearly $175,000â was tied up in the
treasury.
While this delay, which amounted to
several weeks, was in progress numerous
brokers about town saw a chance to make
money and began to send out postals to
the property-owners warning them of
prospective trouble in collecting their
duesand offering to buy their claims.
A majority ot these communications
were exceedingly misleading, giving the
rebaters the impression that they might
never get their dups. As a re>ult one
broker has bought $90,000 worth of claims,
others less amounts, and it is probable
that very few receipts will be presented
outfide of those held by the brokers.
When the tax uooks were in his office
Auditor Broderick went to the trouble and
pains of making up a second set of rebate
books containing computations of the
amount due each rebater and with a place
for his or her signature in case the Treas
urer, cared to make use of them. Thes6
books were not demanded by the law, but
were made by the Auditor at his own
volition to help out the City government.
These books were entirely comprehensive
and so arranged that four clerks could
work on them at the same time and pay
off the rebates in a very short time.
But the order of the Board of Super
visors stood in the way, and still stands,
having been extended to December 16.
Now, Treasurer Widber says that lie is
tired of having his office thronged with
anxious taxpayers, that he does not think
that the Board of Supervisors has any
right to hold the rebates ia the treasury
on this or any other ground, and that he
thinks that Mr. Willett erred in advising
the board that it could do so.
"I have been looking up the authorities
ou this matter," said Mr. Widber yester
day, "and 1 cannot see where the board
gets%ny power to interfere with the pay
ment of the rebate. The law says that I
must pay these demands on demand, and
unless some legal obstacle h placed in my
way I shall delay no longer, the Board of
Supervisors to the contrary notwithstand
ing.
"I shall have a conference with the City
and County Attorney to-morrow to make
aure of my position, and if he say-t I am
ritfbt I shall go ahead, unless Mr. Willett
has me enjoined by the courts."
Auditor Broderick is wiih Mr. Widber
in his belief that Mr. Willett's advice to
the board was erroneous, and stands ready
to turn over the rebate books whenever
they are asked for.

The arrow flies with the wind. The top figure!

rainfall, of melted snow in Inches and hundredth*. :
â¢ during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid i
lines, connect poln s of equal air pressure; iso- I
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The !
p-ora "hii!h" means high barometric pressure and
Is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains. :
.."Lows" usually first appear on the Washington j
â¢coast. When the pressure is high in the Interior j
. and low along the coast, and the Isobars extend I
, north and south along the coast, rain is probable; :
. but when the "low" is Inclosed with Isobars of j
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is lmprob
=â¢ able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idabo, and :
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer |
weather may be expected in summer and colder

Will .produce an opposite result.

Not a Good Sailor.
A lady who live 3in an inland town in
New England went to the last conven
tion of the Christian Endeavor societies
at Washington and traveled from Boston
to Baltimore by steamer. She had never
been on the sea before.
After her first night on the steamer a
friend observed, wuen sue made her ap
pearance on deck in the morning, that
she looked very much fatigued.
"Why," said the friend, "I am afraid
travel by water does not agree with you.
Didn't you sleep well? The sea has been
perfectly calm."
"Sleep!" exclaimed the lady. "I didn't
sleep a wink. lam tired all out, and I
shall never travel by water again."
"What bas tired you out?"
''Why, trying to sleep in that thing. I
read the card in tbe stateroom about now
to put on the life preserver, and I thought
I understood it all right, but I suppose I
didn't, for I couldn't eet a wink of sleep
witn the thing on." â Youth's Companion.

shoes. Some weeks ago a co-operative
shoe repairing factory opened on Tele
grapb avenue, purchased a fancy cart, did
considerable poster advertising, and cut
rates for soling and heeling to about one
third the usual "price.
i his raised a-war with the regular cob
blers, and a few mornings after opening,
ttie new store which had been gaudily
painted was .found to be plastered and
smeared all over with daubs of black
paint. and signs were blotted
out, and the disfi_'urenitnt caused some
sympathy lor the unlucky cobblers.
That sympathy, however, "has dis
appeared with the company. Several
people- who had entrusted their_ worn-out
shoes to the cobblers called at the store a
couple of days aao to receive them. They
were surprised to see a sipn in the window
â which was all that remained of the once
â flourishing cut-rate cobblery. The sign
read, "Parties who have not called for
their shoes can recover them by sending
to San Jose."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 3, 1/896.
Father Brennan's Improvised Schoolhouse in the Rear of St. Francis Church Into Which the Priest
Wished to Lead His Pupils,
WILL SUE FOR
AN INJUNCTION
The School and Health Con
flict to go Into the
Courts.
INSPECTORS ON GUARD.
Rev. Father Brennan Again At
tempts to Open St Francis
School.
HE TEARS DOWN MORE NOTICES
New Cases of Diphtheria Reporte 1.
Trial Continued Till Next
Saturday.
The war between the health and edu
cational departments of the City smol
dered yesterday, except along the line
occupied by Father Brennan and St.
Francis School. There the flames of the
conflict blazed up when the clergyman
found a troop of medical inspectors and a
diphtheria placard at bis schoolhouse
door.
He at first resisted the interference of
the health officials when he attempted to
take his pupils into the building, but
finally concluded to await the outcome of
the action of the Board of Education
against the Board of Health.
The inspectora early took their stations
yesterday morning at the doors of all the
condemned schools, with orders to resist
any attempt to enter the buildings or re
move the notices from the walls. At
about 8:30 a. m. the teachers acting under
orders from Superintendent Babcock be
gan to arrrive at their respective posts of
duty.
in general each teacher was accompany
ing a Devy of her little girl pupils, but the
boys were absent, for the offer of a vaca
tion, even out of season, was not to be re
fused.
The teachers and their charges were po
litely informed that there would be no
school that day, and without a word they
all returned home. At the Everett School,
on Sanchez street near Seventeenth, a
gant; of camenters are laying a yard-floor.
Chloride of lime was first sprinKled
thickly on the ground between the s.x
inch redwood sleepers and the inch and a
half pine planking put down. Almost
30,000 feet of lumber will be used in floor
ing the entire yard. No work is being
done around the shabby looking sheds
known as the Marshall Primary School,
on Mission street,; and the Health Office
seals on the doors are unbroken.
When the case of Father Thomas Bren
nan was called in Judge Campbell's court
yesterday morning Attorney Matt Sulli
van asked for a continuance pending the
injunction proceedings to be instituted
by the Board of Health against the School
Directors. Father Brennan had been
served with a warrant Tuesday morning
and cbareed with removing a diphtheria
placard which the health authorities bad
posted at, the entrance of St. Francis
parochial school, at Sixteenth and. Dolores
streets.
In reply to Attorney Sullivan's request
Judge Campbell said he felt the case
should be tried and the question settled
without delay, as the Schools should be
opened if the Officer was in the
wrong and the action of tnat official up
held by the law if the lives of the pupils
were endangered by attendance at the
condemned schools.
After some discussion a continuance
was granted by consent of the prosecution
till next Saturday morning.
The cases of School Director H. C. Hen
derson and Thomas Lowney, the Re
corder's clerk, charged with the same
offense, were also continued till Saturday
by the same court.
Ten inspectors were Bent by Health
Officer Lovelace to guard the St. Francis
School yesterday morning, and though
they displayed great watchfulness Father
Brennan managed to steal anot er march
on them. It happened this way: Nine o
the deputies were stationed at the Do
lores-street entrance of the school, believ
ing that the cleraryman would endeavor to
march the children in through that gate.
One lone deputy was sent to guard the
entrance to the old Mission Church on
Sixteenth street ButFat'ier Brennan en
tered the church from the rear and opened
the doors and the children, who had in
the mean time gathered on the sidewalk,
quietly filed into the old edifice and -at
there patiently awaiting the signal lor the
next move from their pastor.
Soon word reached the inspectors that
they had been outwitted, and after a brief
consultation as to what was the best
method to pursue a trio of them ap
proached Father Brennan, L. F. Long act
ing as spokesman. He advised the clergy
man that any attempt on his part to
match the children through the rear yard
and la that way reach the school would
be met with resistance and much un
pleasantness from the officers, and that it
would be best for all partios concerned to
send the children home and let the matter
be placed in the courts. But Father
Brennan insisted that the Board of Health
was acting wrongly and without authoiity;
that they had no more rieht to enter'and
take possession of his school and grounds
thau they nad to enter and take possession
of his private residence.
When some one offered the suggestion
that an injunction had better be taken out
to prevent the deputies causing further
trouble Father Brennan stated that he
had no patience with injunctions; they
were too slow lor him. lie felt that he
was right in the way he was acting,
and would not be dictated to by a score of
deputies who bad no ousiness in his private
grounds.
The inspectors then retired to the rear
yard, as they thought the clergyman
would attempt to bring the children into
a little house immediately back of the
St. Francis School, a building that had
not be n occupied for a few years past.
Taey surrounded the little schoolhouse,
and as many as could stood on the steps
and awaited the coming of the pupils,
headed by Father Brennan. They had
not lonsi to wait, for the clergyman soon
appeared with his scholars.
There was a dead silence as the clergy
man crossed the yard, but as he ascended
the steps of the schoolhouse Market In
spector Ben Davis said:
"Father Brennan, you and the children
will not be allowed to enter this school
house." "I will enter," said tne clergy
man. He had been followed by his sta
bleman, who had tried to force the door,
but was unceremoniously ejected by a
stalwart deputy.
"Then I will be compelled to arrest you,"
88id Davis. "I will send for the patrol
and have you driven down to the City
Pri-on."
"Go ahead, arrest me," answered the
clergyman, and then he tore down a no
tice that had been tacked on the school
house, threw it to the ground and said:
'â¢How dare any man tack a notice of this
kind on my private property? There is
no case of diphtheria on these premises."
Inspector Davis then informed him that
his duty to the board would compel him
to replace the notice. "Go ahead and re
place it and I will paste a blazing placard
under saying the above is a lie."
The deputies then decided to allow
Father Brennan to enter the building, but
warned him that there would be serious
trouble if he attempted to bring in the
children.
He stepped about two feet irto the
schoolhouse and then turned and said, "1
will go for a policeman and with his aid
take my children into this schoolhouse. I
would like you to tell me if it is America
or Russia we are living in? Are we under
the autocratic rule of the Czar or are we
in a country where every man is entitied
to protect his own property?"
By tnis time Father Brennan was very
much wrought up &nd> his indignation
was plainly visible. After instructing^the
teachers to return with the children into
the church he retired to his residence.
Father Brennan is not a man to be easily
downed, and in an interview yesterday he
remarked that he would win yet. He
takes great exception to the notices posted
conspicuously Rb >ut his property warning
people that diphtheria is raging about the
premises. One of the deputies remarked
incidentally he thought the board should
have notices to the effect that, owing to
the prevalence of diphtheria in that sec
tion of the City, it was considered advisa
ble to close the schools and do away with
tho diphtheria warning.
Father Brennan had been notified some
weeks ago by the Board of Health that
the closets in the yard of the St. Francis
School were not the kind specified by the
law, and that patent closets should replace
immediately the stone vaults now in use.
Hn promised that during the two weeks'
vacation at Christmas time he would at
tend to the matter, but the board consid
ered that tc delay meant much sickness
and probably death caused from diphthe
ria germs emanating from the stone
vaults.
The Judiciary Committee of the Board
of Education met yesterday forenoon and
decided to enjoin the Board of Health
from further interference in the school
affairs. The law firm of Sullivan & Sulli
van havinn been retained in the cases of
Director Henderson, Father Brennan and
Thomas Lowney, it was decided to employ
the same firm.
Ex-Judge Sullivan stated yesterday that
the Board of Health was clearly in the
wrong in arbitrarily declaring a empty
schoolhouse to be infected with a conta
gious disenso and posting guards at its
doors to prevent entrance.
"Acting under this presumption," said
he, "what is to prevent them from posting
their prohibiting nouces on any public or
private building in this City and clearing
such building of its inmates? What pro
tection has any man in his own house if
L the Board of Health may enter and turn
him out of it ? The board bases its autho
rity on section 3028 of the health and quar
antine laws, where it reads that it is vested
with power to define, determine and ad
judge whatshall constitute a nuisance and
a menace to public health; but is either
one of those s^chooiuonses a public nni
sance? It the School Directors are guilty
of maintaining a nuisance then they may
be proceeded against in the manner pro
vided for, not by locking achnoihouse
Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria.
doors and turning the pupils loose on the
streets.
"Now section 30 of order IGOI says in
effect that placards or notices may be
placed on the doorway of any house in
fected by contagious disease, and that it
is a misdemeanor to remove them. Has
the Board of Health proven that the Mis
sion school buildings are infested with
diphtheria when not a single pupil is
known to be ill, or to have been exposed
to the disease? II the posting of those
notices was illegal, then the removal of
them was not, and neither Director
Henderson nor Father Brennan was
guilty of a misdemeanor.
"This is not the first time the courts
have checked the arbitrary vvork of the
Board of Health. I have here in. these
New York reports several cases where
they have been called down hard, and I
believe the Superior Court of tbia State
will rule along the same line in this case.
The Board of Health is an excellent and
a necessary body, but it must respect
the rights of the citizens. Moreover, the
Board of Health must not infringe on the
rights of the Board of Education under
the mere presumption that the latter is
maintaining a public nuisance, simply be
cause a schoolhouse stands in a district
wnere sickness abound-."
Attorney Matt Sullivan was more out
spoken in his strictures upon the- action
of the health authorities.
â¢ "It was a hieh-handed proceeding," said
he, "to place those warning notices on the
doors, and those inspectors on the steps of
those buildings.
"But we will restrain the Board of
Health from proceeding further in this
matter and we will have its trespassing
guards removed. The board is interfering
with the rights of the public and with the
duties of the teachers and the Board of
Education. We will file our papers to
morrow."
"This is the first Board of Health that
ever went directly to work," said a mem
ber of that body yesterday. "Conse
quently a large number of people in the
City who have received the attentions of
the health inspectors are sore. The health
ordinances of San Francisco are the most
lenient of any large city in the United
States. We have here copies of those
sanitary laws and have carefully com
pared them with ours. The peojlewill
learn soon that the Board of Health is a
body that cannot be trifled with.
"Those who have some doubt as to its
power should notice the fol. owing para

by the Healt.i Officer that any building or part

ObjÂ«ct tv a Crematory.
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. 2.â The West
OaKiand Improvement Club at last night's
mepting passed a resolution disapproving
)fc he garbage crematory on Peralta
stitct. In a resolution which was unani
mously passed, the club referred to the
fact that at the present time negotiations
are pending for the establishment of a
public park in West Oakland, and that it
is absurd to have a garbage crematory and
a public park anywhere near each other.
Colonel John P. Irish is one of ttie most
energetic members of Ihe league, and for
many years he has worked hard to sup
press the marsh nuisance. Messrs. Kee
nig, Henneberry and Irish were appointed
a committee to look into the matter.
Stole Diamonds in Daylight.
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. 2.â A daylight
robbery of diamonds took place yesterday
from a San Bablo-avenue store. While
the proprietor, W. B. Greenebaum, was at
lunch the store was iv charge of E. R.
King, a watchmaker. A colored man
about 30 years of age entered and asked
to be shown some diamond rings. He
had been there several days previously
and talked about the diamonds and
said his name was Watson. He called
again yesterday and after he had left a
large solitaire and a cluster ring were
missing. The matter was reported to the
police and it is believed that the thief
was a professional operator from San
Francisco.

WILL BRIDGE THE
CREEK TOGETHER
Alameda Supervisors and
the Railway Company-
Join Hands.
They Will Erect a Handsome
Steel Structure for General
Uses.
The Estuary Bridg Must Be Completed
Next August and th O.d Ones
R-moved.
It was practically settled yesterday that
a magnificent steel bridge to accommo
date tho traffic between Oakland and Ala
nieda and both broad and narrow gauge
trains of the Southern Pacific Company
will be built across the estuary forming
Oakland harbor. The bridee must be
constructed, no matter what its character
may be, before next August, for the War
Department has settled that detail. Now
the only cause for delay is a study of the
law as it affects the power of Supervisors
of Alameda County to join with the rail
way company in building a bridge for
county and railway uses conjointly.
There was a conference yesterday after
noon between the supervisors of Alameda
County and General Manager Kruttschfiitt
anil W. G. Curti-*, engineer of the main
tenance of way department of the South
ern Pacific Company. The Supeivisors
cam e to this City and met the railway of
ficials in their offices at Montgomery and
Market streets. The company declared
itself in favor of meeting the Alameda
company representatives half way. That
is, it would build the proposed steel bridge
in conjunction with the Supervisors, each
paying a share of the cost.
As a. result of the meeting the Alameda
Supervisors went home well pleased with
their day's work, for the reason if the law
presents no obstacles their plan to join
the railway company in this wori will
save considerable money to the county.
But one master still remains to be de
terminedâthat is the exact location of the
bridge, wtich would suit the parties di
rectly interested and the public as well.
Mr. Curtis explained the various points
involved in the whole matter yesterday.
He said :
"There is a bridge at Webster street
used by the county as a thoroughfare and
by the narrow-gaune road, and another at
Alice street used exclusively by the broad
gauge line to Alamtda.
"Several months ago the Secretary of
War notified the owners of both bridges
that they were obstructing navigation,
and that" the bridges should be rebuilt,
each with a drawbridge having a span of
at least 150 feet.
"A meeting of the officials of Alamftla
County and of the Southern Pacific Cum*
pany was held in the office of Colonel
Suter, at which a formal protest was
made against the span order. The rail
way company said it would obey any or
der of the Secretary of War, but when it
built a bridge replacing the one at Alice
street, it would make it large enough to
carry both the narrow and broad gauge
trains. The result was the Secretary of
War ordered that both bridges should be
built before August 20, 1897.
"The railroad company has informed the
Secretary of War of their intention to
comply with his order, and at the same
time asked for his approval of outline
plans of the proposed bridge submitted.
"This morning the Supervisors of Aia
meda County called on Mr. Kruttschnitt
and myself. They stated that they would
be willing to join with the railroad com
pany in making one bridge serve all pur
poses in place of the existing bridges.
"The railroad company was agreeable to
thia proposition, and the county officials
are to ascertain what can be done under
the law to lawfully join in the const me- !
tion of a bridge for the common usa of the
pubiicand the railway company.
"Other conferences will be he!d when
the Alame'la Supervisors desire to hold
them looking to the adju tment of the
matter. Of course this puts our other
plan in the air. Anyhow, I can say that j
the propose 1 oridge will be of steel, about ]
375 feet long, with a draw of 150 feet.
"The mot.ye power for the draw will be |
furnished by steam, hydraulic or electric- !
ity, but this is a detail to be determined
later. The bridge wili be very large and
rest on niascnrv riers."

THE FAVORITES
WERE SLAUGHTERED
Bookmakers Kept Most of
the Coin on "Ladies'
Day."
Griffin's Horse, The Dragoo,
Was a Surprise in the
Handicap.
Al Stanfcrd Landed the Hurdle Event
With Cap:am Rces â Libertine
Bjaten Out by Howard S.
Ladies' day apparently grows in popu
larity Â»t Ingleslde track. Yesterday the
grand stand was fairly jammed with the
fair sex, many with field glass swung over
the shoulder and a well posted up "dope
book." The sport vas devoid of accident,
bar a nasty tunable received by little Claw
son, who had the mount oa the favorite
Red Glenn in the last event. .Passing the
stand the horse was pocketed, and stumb
ling threw.the boy hard. The hard-headed
youngster escaped with a few alight
bruises.
The books bad a great day of it, as but
one lightly played even-money choice
sauntered in ahead of his field. Eddie
Jones ingratiated himself with the ladies
by landing three winneis. Horatio, a 30 to
1 shot, started the ball rollinc by captur
ing the first race, and from that time on
the guessing was difficult.
Even with but four starters in the mile
handicap the crowd put their checks down
wrong. Nebuchadnezzir carried most of
me money bet at the short odds of 9 to 10,
but Tommy Griffin's black horse, The
Dragon, happened to be feelinc welJ, and
showing the way to 'Nebby' from the
jump Ueat him a length in 1:42^. Lin
coln II was thir.l.
'The result of the mile and a fnrlong
hurdle affair truly shocked the informa
tion-seekers. Cajilain Rees, the Corrigan
entry, a 12 10 1 shot, excellently ridden by
Al Stanford, raced away in the lead with
the favorite Burniah, and coming away at
the finish won ridden out by a length.
Governor Budd, a 40 to 1 shot, came fast
tne last furlong and downed the first
choice a neck for the place.
Galen Brown's Dig bay horse Libertine,
with 115 poulids in the saddle, looked
about the most likely of the seven starters
in the six-fur!ong purse event, and was
heavily played at 0 to 5. Down the stretch
it looked very rosy for the favorite, when
below the paddock the 7 to 1 outsider,
â Howaid S, with 97 pounds up, came skim
ming along and won galloping. Mackiin
on Libertine wÂ«:s forced to a drive to get
the place from McLight.
Twelve two-year-olds lined up at the
barrier in the opening five-furlong scram
ble. Shaw, astride of the 30 to 1 shot
Horatio, got his mount away in iront and
was never headed, leading Osric 11. wno.
with Good Times, ruled equal in the bet
ting, out a length and a half at the wire.
The fifth race, over the s^ven-furlong
route, did not draw out a very high-class
lot. With Johnny McHale scratched
Gratify was a hot even-money choice and
won irom Branimetta, wiih pounds to
snare. Miss Cunningham was third.
For the fin.nl mile and a sixteenth run
six started and lied Glenn opened an even
money chancf. He receded to Bto 5 and
whether he would have won or not will
forever remain a mystery owing to the ac
feident. As the race was run Paloma'.-iui
headed/Trappean in the stretch and finished
nearly two lengths 'in advance of Theliua
at the wire. Little Cripple was a close
third.
Notes.
Had Osric II not been cut off he would
undoubtedly have beaten Horatio out in
tlie'opening race.
Gallant has been turned over 1o Andy
Slakeley and will receive a courss of
schooling over the sicks.

SEEKING NEW FIELDS.
Jockey Chevalier Ruled off Local Bace-
trucks, Departs fur Guatemala.
Chevalier, the clever jockey who made
such an unenviable record with "Little
Pete" at the Bay District track.and who has
. been ruled off in consequence, is about to
I seek new fields in which to piy his trade.
Saturday he drove to the Mail dock in
j haste and clamored for a berth on the
I Costa Rica, about to sail for Guatemala.
j There was none for him, every inch of the
vessel's capacity being already taken up.
The game little man offered all kinds of
money in exchange for accommodation,
but the passengers, who had all been
transferred from the City of Sydney, were
! determined, not to part with their privi
lege at any price. ""/'.,.
Tuesday morning, however. Chevalier.
! steamed away aboard the City of Sydney,
! which has been turned into a freight ship
i and is to make a run to La Libertad and
back. The Sydney is not supposed to
carry passenger", but Chevalier has man
aced to offer sufficient and convincing ar
guments to be accepted on board for the
trip.. â  â _. .' .â  .; '}. ;: â  ' I
Chevalier's anxiety to get away has two
Bides. In the first place, his work op.
local tracks has caused him to be ruled off
and has shut off bis mode of livelihood,
In the second place, he has found a brand
i new field in Guatemala. :
Emil Schuman, the only horseman down
j there, cabled here for a clever, jockey to
ride durine the Christmas races. He
wanted an intelligent boy, capable of rid
in? according to instructions, and he got
him in Chevalier. The deal was made
through W. Miller of the gas company,
| and when the jockey reaches Guatemala
| the natives will be treated to a trick or
! two of which they ; have as yet no knowl
j edge.

ANOTHER SURPRISE
Deep Disappointment of
Lawyers in the Fair
Litigation.
Craven Ejectment Suits Dis
missed as to the Daughters
of Fair.
The Fight Now CoDfineJ to the
Executorsâ The Suit to Quiet
Title Set for Trial.
<Â«Oh!d ! Go to heaven !" exclaimed
George A. Knight in Judge Slack's court
room yesterday afternoon. The word
used was not quite as good as "heaven,"
but quite otherwise.
"Mr. Knieht, you must be more careful
of your language In this court, " said Judge
Slack, speaking quietly and with that de
liberation which marks the manner ol a
man in earnest.
Mr. Knight with flushed face hastened
Among the Fleet That Went to Sea on the Ebb Tide Yesterday "Was the Big American Clipper Ship
Shenandoah. Out of Half a Dozen Vessels She "Was the First to Cast Adrift From the Tu*
and Get Under "Way on Her Long Ron to Europe.
to explain that he was speaking to Attor- I
ney Reuoen H. Lloyd and that the words
had been wrung from him by his impa
tience over the sudden and unexpected
turn of affairs in the matter then under
consideration, namely, the application to
examine the deeds given by the late James
G. Fair to Nettie R. Craven for property
worth about $1,500,000.
MY. Knight wanted to see the docu
ments and was disappointed when he
found himself and his associates iti inter
est, for'the attorneys of all the child ren
of Mr. Fair join in opposing Mrs. Craven,
thwarted by a masterly stroke on the part
ot Delmas & Shortridge, attorneys for M rs.
Craven.
The chagrin of Mr. Kniglit over his de
feat, joined with some suggestions whis
pered by Mr. Lloyed, caused the outburst
of temper oa Mr. Knight's part, lor which
he made the amend honorable not only in
. court, but afterward in a personal expla
nation to Judge Slack in his Honor's
chambers.
It was evident that Mr. Knight also
wished to set himself right before the
community, for he explained to the re
porters who remained after the adjo urn
nien't of court that it was a case of undue
exasperation whorj even the famous Uncle
Toby, so ereatly extolled by Laurence
Sflerne in "Tristram Shandy," would have
blurted out an oath eauil to any heard
in the army in Flanders.
"Lloyd nas been makine me tired for
the last six months or â  a year," said Mr.
Knight, "by his constant suggestions.
My client, Charles Fair, and myself, should
take the brunt of all the battle. When
has he got in a cross-complaint or an
answer all along the line? What has he
done to bring any of the cases to an issue?
What did he do in regard to the trust
provisionof the will? Lookatus. We've
got in our fighting papers all along the
line, and he comes in under our proceed
ings because our clients happened to be
named as co-defendants and demands an
inspection of these deed. If he had left it
to ua'to make tHe application we would
have been all right and no bowling out of
court such as we have here to-day could
have happened.
"After Judpe Slack's ruling that he had
nothing more to do with the matter then
on hearing, Lloyd began to tell me again
what I'd better do to help him out, so I
let siip an exclamation of impatience. I
couldn't help it. But my client is all
right. His cross-complaint is on file, and
when we get ready we will ask in our own
way for an inspection o f the papers."
It was before Mr. Knight's outbreak
that the really important event of the day
happened, when D. M. Delmas, by a
wholly unexpected move, ou: flanked and
disappointed the army of lawyers engaged
in the Fair estate litigation.
Judge Slack's courtroom was crowded
with them at 2 o'clock, all eager to handle
and inspect the two deeds under which

Nettie R. Craven lays claim to property of
the late Senator's valued at $1,500,000. A
special order of the court had been secured
by the counsel of Mrs. Oelrichs and Vir
ginia Fair requiring that the deeds be pro
duced in court where, under the auspices
of Judge Slack himself, they might be
inspected.
But not only the attorneys for the Fair
daughters, but the counsel for Charles
Fair and all the other counsel, together
with a small army of experts, were gath
ered there with microscopes and such
other paraphernalia as might aid in dis
secting the handwriting of the deeds.
The army with their instruments waited
patiently, confident in themselves, for the
moment when the court should order the
custodians of the deeds to hand them
over. There had been some preliminary
talk about the litigation and Judge Slack
in response to a motion had set for trial on
the 2d of February the case of Angus vs.
Cravenâ the suit to quiet title.
When Judge Slack called the case of
Craven against Fair and others and Cra
ven against Oelrichs and ethers Mr. Del
mas arose and handed two neatly type
written documents to the clerk.
Judge Slack remarked that the exam
ination of the deeds to the property io
question would be in order, whereupon
Mr. Delmas arose and said:
"The case of Angus vs. Craven having
been set for trial and is now at issue, and
that case having the double advantage of
including both pieces of property covered
by the deeds in question, it is deemed by
us unnecessary to prosecute any further
the suits of Craven vs. Fair and Craven
vs. Oelrichs as to certain defendants. I
have hied dismissals ot those cases."
This was the unexpected that happened,
and that, when he realized what it meant,
made George Knight say "dâ n."
The dismissal of the suits under which
the application for the inspection of the
deeds was made and the order granted of
course dismissed the order with it, and
the whole matter ended there.
Mr. Delmas' remark explained the situa
tion. When the deeds were brought for
ward Mrs. Crayon began two separate
suits in ejectment, one against Charles L.
Fair and others for the Mission-street
property, and tne other against Teresa F.
Oelrichs and others for the Sansome
street property.
The executors of the trust willâ then
the special administrators â began suit
against Mrs. Craven to quiet the titie to
both pieces. This suit is Known as Angus
V 3. Craven. It involved the same princi
ple exactly as Mrs. Craven's suits â the
title and ownership of the property.
In the quit of Craven vs. Charles L.
Fair, Mr. Fair brought a cross suit in
which he sets up that Mrs. Craven's deeds
are not genuine. To this cross complaint
Delmas & Shortridge have demurred,
holding that such cross complaint cannot
be made in a suit in ejectment. The
tiling of the Cross complaint, however,
made it impossible for the plaintiff's at
torneys to dismiss the cause with regard
to this defendant. No cross complaint
had been filed by the daughters, and, on
the other hand, no application to insuect
the deeds had been filed by Charles Fair,
so that when the cases were dismissed as
to the daughters the order of examination
fell.
The court examined the papers filed and
remarked, "Thi.< disposes of the present
matter. The cases, except as tv Mr. Fair,
will go off the calendar."
Mr. Wheeler asked to see the papers and
Mr. Lloyd and Mr. Knieht gathered about
and examined them with ereat care.
Mr Lloyd whispered something in Mr.
Knight's ear which extorted that gentle
man's "exclamation of impatience, as he
so happily termed it.
"There seems to be nothing more to be
done," said Judge Slack.
Mr. Wheeler asked the court to order a
judgment of dismissal entered as to Mrs.
Oeirichs and Miss Fair, and it was so
ordered.
Mr. Delmas then quietly took his de
parture, and the opposing attorneys
watched his receding form far down the
corridor before they appeared to realize
the manner in which their fondest hopes
had been foiled and blasted by a single
turn of the wrist, so to speak â a legal sur
prise that for the nonce took away their
breaths.
Speaking about the matter last evening
Mr. Brittain, speaking for Delmas &
Shortridge, said : "This move was made
to simplify matters and to prevent at the
same time every Tom, Dick and Harry
pawing over those deeds. It is not at
tempted to prevent anybody seeing the
deeds who has a right to do so. The ex
perts of the executors, Messrs. Carvalho
and Ames, have been given every oppor
tunity to see the deeds. Some seventeen
enlarged photographs have been taken
for them and which they now have. The
one suit of Angus vs. Craven, to quiet
title, will cover the same ground in a more
ample way than would our two suits in
ejectment. Therefore, as that suit has
been set for trial, Mrs. Craven finds it un
necessary to go to the trouble and ex
pense of pushing her suits, and so we dis
missed them. That is all there is to it."
CALIFORNIA WINES ARE BOOMING
Several Important and Largo Shipment*
Recently Made.
The enthusiasm demonstrated in the
meeting of the wine-makers held a short
time ago appears to be warranted by the
healthy condition of the wine market in
dicated by activity and larger transactions
along the entire line. The shipping busi
ness to Eastern trade centers is getting
into more satisfactory channels again.
Among the more formidable deals we
notice the transfer of 300,000 gallons of
Sonoma County wines of tue vintage of
1895 to the Gnndlach-Bundschu Wine
Company of this City. These wines are
the products of the late Hon. I. de Turk
of banta Rosa, and were made a few
months prior to his death under his special
care and supervision. The sale was
effected under satisfactory conditions and
prices by William H. Lumsden i^so... ex
ecutor of the De Turk estate, and received
the affirmation of the Probate Court.
Prior to the election no satisfactory bid
could be obtained for this choice lot of
wines, while after the result of the elec
tion was established a lively competition
for their purchase was inaugurated with
the above result.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 3, 1896.
DEMANDING MORE
CALIFORNIA WHEAT
Three Vessels Loaded for
Europe Got Away
Yesterday.
The Shenandoah Was the First
to Cast Adrift and Get
Under Way.
Wheat Was Burned in the Furnaces
cf a Big Norwegian Tramp That
Broke Down.
Wheat is in demand in Europe, and in
consequence the golden grain is pouring
out of California. Yesterday three ships
got away with full loads and half a dozen
others are ready to sail. A big fleet went out
on the ebb tide, among them being the big
American ship 9 Shenandoah and Cyrus
Wakeheld, the British bark Cambusdoon,
the brig W. G. Irwin and the British ship
Blairgowrip.
The Shenandoah made a pretty picture
when the tug Vigilant cast her off. The
wind was from the northeast, and there
fore favorable for ships going to sea. Off
Alcatraz Captain Murphy ordered the
staysails set and off Fort Point the top
sails were run up. Passing Point Bonita
almost all the sails were in place, and as
soon as the tug cast her adrift the Shenan
doah was speeding on her way to Eng
land.
The Cambusdoon was towed out by the
Monarch and the Blairgowrie by the
Alert. All three vessels are bound for
Europe, and considerable interest is taken
in the outcome of the race. Captain
Murphy is confident that his ship will
make the run in 100 days or less, and if
she does the Britishers will not be in it.
The tug Reliance took out the Cyrus
Wakefield, bound for New York, and the
W. G. Irwin for Hawaii. In spite of her
double burden she raced the Monarch
from off Alcatraz to the bar and beat her
easily. Captain Brockaw of the Reliance
says the result Is due to the new corru
gated wheel, which was put in place a few
weeks ago.
All the vessels that went to sea wore
fully loaded and their cargoes alone are
valued at $1,000,000. The ShÃnandoah
took general merchandise and wheat and
her consignments amount to over $190,000.
The Norwegian tramp steamer Herman
Wedel Jarlsberg was in greater trouble
than the first cables told of. She was re
ported as haying v>ut into Yokohama with
Her shaft disabled, but later advices re
ceive! by the Merchants' Exchange yes
terday state that the Jarlsberg came near
sharing the fate of the Linlithgow. In any
event she was almost in the same predica
ment as the R.o de Janeiro when she ran
short of coal. She ran into a heavy gale,
and some sails that were set to steady the
steamer were blown away and two boats
were washed out of the davits. Coal ran
short and the gaffs and booms and twenty
tons of wheat were burnt up in order to
get the vessel into Yokohama. It will be
several weeks before the Jarlsberg is ready
for sea again, and in the meantime her
destination may be changed. The Jaris
berg was bound for Calcutta.
The ferry steamer Encmal was put on
the narrow-gauge route again yesterday.
The work of overhauling and putting her
in good shape for the winter has been
rushed, as the traveling public was
grumblinz over the accommodations af
forded by the El Capitan. The latter boat
was too small for the business, but to
piease the people the Encinal has been
put back on the run a weelc or ton days
before she was ready. Now everybody is
growling because the paint and varnish is
not perfectly dry.
The Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
Walla Walla got in about noon yesterday,
about twenty-four hours behind time.
Captain Wallace reports unusually h^avy
weather between Cape Flattery and the
Golden Gate, and owing to the heavy head
winds the vessel was hove- to several
times.
Captain Thompson of the 8. C. Allen is
to tafce command of the R. P. Rithet. The
lormer is now in Honolulu harbor loading
for San Francisco and the Rithet is on her
I way from Newcastle, Australia, to Hono
lulu with a load of coal. The mate of the
Allen will bring the vessel to this port.
Vallejo took as great an interest in the
Fitzsimmons-Sharkey contest as San
i Francisco. Yesterday a band of enthu
siastic sports came down on the Sunol
and some of them went home sadder but
wiser men. A big contingent came from
the Navy Yard and every one of them was
an enthusiastic Sharkey man. Henry
Stahl, who with James Coakley owns and
publishes the Vallejo Morning News, also
came down. He proposed attending the
fight in order that the people of Vallejo
and Mare Island might get the contest
round by round, as soon as the readers of

SCHOOL DIRECTORS
EXAMINE PLANS
Designs for the Mission
High School Under
Discussion.
Searching Questions Asked by
Members of the Board of
Education.
Eleven Architects Explain Their
Plansâ No Dscision Arrived
at as Yet
The Board of Education in special
session wrestled manfully with the prob
lem of selecting a design for the new
M ission High School yesterday.
All day they were entertained by archi
tects who desire that their plans ba ac
cepted, and when the session was over the
members had listened to eleven gentle
men, each of whom was sure that his
design was the best. Those who addressed
the board were: McDougal Brothers,
Laist& Schwerdt, William Moore & Son,
W. A. de Prosse, Smith & Freeman,
Thomas P. RoÂ«s, Powell & Wilson, W. 0.
BankÂ», Cahiil & Condon, W. Jones Cuth
bertson and Charles I. Havens.
The design of W. O. Banks caused favor
able comment, the drawings showing a
massive substantial looking structure.
The interior was also carefully arranged
with a view to the health and comfort of
the scholars.
The questions asKed the architects were
practically the same, the Directors inquir
ing into the ventilation, floor space per
pupil, situation of toilets, the lighting and
other arrangements of the basements, the
number and character of the stairways,
whether the same would be fireproof or
not, the character of the roofing and floor
ing, the appliances for escape in case of
rite and other matters.
The Directors wera particularly anxious
to know whether the buildings designed
could be built within the appropriation
for the purpos e.
No decision was arrived at, the Directors
desiring a full board present before arriv
ing at a conclusion. The matter will be
taken up at another special meeting.
