THOUSANDS ASSEMBLE TO CELEBRATE
THEIR DELIVERANCE.
Noisy Greeting to President Claus Spreckels
and the Company's Directorsâ Parade,
Oratory and a Free
Barbecue.
FRESNO, Cal., Oct. s.â Tbis was a
great day for Fresno and the San Joaquin
Valley. It was the day of its liberation
from a bondage of high railroad tariffs.
Just as the slave snaps his shackles and
steps forth a free man, so Fresno broke
the chains that have for many years linked
her to tne Southern Pacific Railroad Com
pany and cast them to the four winds.
Even nature was glad. The day was a
glorious one. The warm sun, high in
"the bending blue," looked down on a
rich and smiling valley, a prosperous,
happy, enthusiastic, exultant and free
people.
The feeling ol approaching freedom has
long been pent up. To-day the popula
tion of the valley for many miles around
assembled here and gave vent to it in tne
form of a celebration. So large a crowd
was never seen in Fresno before. Ten
thousand throats cheered the day. Busi
ness men who have not decorated their
stores before in years hung out flags aud
festoons; phlegmatic people became ex
cited; the small boy turned out with
wooden guns; sedate men pulled on red
shirts over their heads and stepped into
line. Large and luscions melons were
pierced by long poles and carried high in
the procession by ranchers as proudly as
any Csesar ever carried the head of an en
emy into Rome.
These were only a few of the striking
features of a parade over a mile long of
natural and manufactured products. It
all marched under a triumphal arch com
posed of two telegraph poles and a banner
bearing the words, "The Valley Road
Greets You." And it was this also that
the people greetedâ the San Francisco and
San Joaquin Valley Railroad.
The formal celebration began with the
arrival of the excursion train from Stock
ton at 1:30 o'clock this afternoon. People
from San Francisco went to Stockton by
train and boat the evening before to catch
this train. Among them were the direct
ors and President Claus Spreckels, whose
individual subscription of $500,000 after
the project lad several times failed made
the Valley road not only a possibility but
the welcome reality that it is to-day, open
and ready for business.
The first train and the celebration here
'.o-day have plainly given a big impetus
to the San Francisco and San Joaquin
Valley Railroad. In leading hotels to
night many business men and ranchers,
were heard to say that they would make
their next shipments of raisins, wheat,

lumber or fruit over the Valley Railroad.
The first through passenger train over
the Valley road left Stockton a few min
utes after 8 o'clock this morning. The
train consisted of six handsomely painted
and finely furnished coaches and two
combination baggage and passenger cars.
The passenger rolling stock is painted
yellow, much in the same shade as the
old yellow Chicago, Burlington & Quincy
cars back East. The lettering is in silver,
with a narrow border of black. It was a
handsome train, pulled by a brand new
fifty-five ton locomotive just out of the
Baldwin shops.
A large crowd of Stocktonians saw the
train leave, notwithstanding the early
hour. Stockton has been and will con
tinue 10 be, greatly benefited by the Val
ley road. As the train began to move
the crowd cheered for the Valley road
and at the last glimp-e had of it from the
rear platform handkerchiefs snd hats
were still waving in air.
And such was the reception all along the
125 miles of the line between Fresno and
Stockton. Every few miles was a group of
people assembled to see the train goby.
All cheered it a hearty welcome.
Even the jack rabbits in the brown stubble
fields raised up on their haunches and
pricked up their ears at the unusual clatter.
Tnere was not farmhouse from which a
handkerchief was not waved or a plowman
in the lield who did not swing his hat. If
a wagon road ran along the track any dis
tance the occupants of vehicles pulled up
their horse* and cheered. At almost
every siding and crossroad was a cluster
of glad people.
Engine 50, with Engineer Jonn Arm
strong at the throttle and Master Mechanic
Rutherford in the cab much of the time,
did herseif proud, notwithstanding the
fact that this was the first time she had
been really tested with a heavy train. No.
50 was gvaly decorated with ropes of flow
ers and the brass railings along her boiler
were entwined with red, white, blue and
yellow streamers, which fluttered gayly in
the breeze she made by her own swift
pace.
The other day No. 50 was taken out and
warmed up in a trial spin with two
coaches behind her. She ran more than
twenty-one miles, from Escalon to Stock
ton, in twent}'-one minutes, which is an
example of the kind of rolling stock the
whole Valley road is equipped with.
A fine new station, costing $3000, is
now being built at Escalon. The directors
and the officials of the road got off the
train and inspected this and other im
provements along the line, completed or
in progress of construction. The party
included: President Claus Spreckel?

While inspecting the fine new bridge at
Berneyville Ferry, James D. Phelan tore
a considerable rent in a pair of new
trousers while crawling through a barbed
wire fence. Diiector Phelan lamented
the fact that he was interested in the rail
road and could not sue it to recover dam
ages.
Nearly every person aboard, when the
train left Stockton, wore the fluttering
yellow badge of the Stockton Commercial
Association. The badge bore these words:
'â¢Stockton rejoices with Fresno." The

The following people from Modesto
drove seven miles and boarded the train
at Clauston : County Assessor J. F. Camp
bell, Supervisor George Toombs, County
Clerk A. 8. Dingley, Sheriff R. B. Purvis
and wife, and Deputy Sheriff Weill Dallas
and wife of Stanislaus County. Conductor
Peter Farrell was in charge of. the train.
The train stopped at nearly every bridge
and embankment of considerable size to
givathe directors and the excursionists nn
opportunity to inspect them. The track
is just as good as the rolling-stock.
Firm tie-plates â the first in California â
are under the rails to prevent them from
cutting into the ties. The roadbed is re
markably smooth for a new road; even
the engine rides the rails smoothly. Next
year the road will be ballasted with
gravel. It will then oe the best roadbed
in the State. The road is not yet open for
regular passenger traffic owing to a lack of
depot facilities, but it will be in a few
weeks.
The principal stations on the 125 miles
of road number fifteen and are as follows:
Stockton, Burnbam, F-caion, Clauston,
Hugbson, Elmwood. Merced, Geneva, La
Grande, Marguerite, Sharon, Miller,
Lankershim, Patterson and Fresno.
Claustou is named after Claus) Bpreckels.
It was and still is the original intention
to extend the road from San Francisco to
Bakersfield. A freight-shed now under

construction at Fresno will cost $5000.
There is a plat of five acres for depot
grounds near the center of the city. A
passenger station will be constructed
later.
WhÂ«n the train slowly entered Fresno
only twenty minutes late, notwithstand
ing the many stopsâ there was cheering
from the people from the city limits to
the depot grounds. The crowd there was
so dense and the cheering so enthusiastic
that the train had to make its way along
the rails almost inch by inch. It seemed
as though the entire Han Joaquin Valley
had turned out on foot, a-horseback and
on all descriptions of vehicles to receive
it. Some of the more enthusiastic onas
went wild and acted as though they had
never seen a train before.
FEATURES OF THE PARADE.
Story of the San Joaquin Valley's
Emancipation Told in Banner
and Float.
FRESNO, Cal., Oct. s.â The grand pa
rade was awaiting the arrival of the excur
sion train from Stockton. "It's coming to
a stop," was the signal for the parade to
start. The procession was nearly a mile
and a half long and possessed some unique
and beautiful features. There was load
after load of wool, wagons piled high with
fresh fruit or boxes of raisins, mountains
of melons on wheels, little girls in white,
representing the States, chiefs, digni
taries, State officials and prominent citi
zens, vats of wine, cargoes of lumber,
moving pyramids of wheat in sacks,
drawn by teams of twelve mules or horses,
and from one end of the procession to the
other were almost numberless banners ex
pressing the joy that the valley people
feel at their freedom from the thraldom
of excessive and oppressive freight rates.
Many of the banners read like this:
"Our first carload for the Valley road,"
"A royal welcome from the little ones,"
"A royal welcome from the young ladies,"
who rode on horseback and looked very
1 chic in their white dresses and balloon
sleeves. The boys with their wooden guns
fired at imaginary enemies and yelled
t; eir delight at being free to yell to their
hearts' content. "Ready to ship on the
Valley road" was the banner of several
vineyards. A fife and drum corps in a
Yosemite stage shrieked its welcome. The
display made by Clovis Cole, a big wheat
grower of this vicinity, was nearly a quar
ter of a mile long. The parade moved in
the following order:

The procession arrived at the depot
grounds on schedule time and rested on
Tulare street, just before reaching the rail
road crossing. The ciowds that accompa
nied the parade took up positions under
neighboring shade trees and along the
track for several blocks. There was an
eager cranin-r of necks to catch some sign
of the approach of t;.e train, but nothing
could be seen until the majestic front of
the big locomotive made the turn from
Diana street into Q street. A wild cry of
"There she comes !" went up, and was fol
lowed by cheering.
OVATION TO MR. SPRECKELS
"This Is the People's Railroad," He
Declares to the Applauding
Thousands.
FRESNO, Cal, Oct. s.â As soon as the
parade had been reviewed the excursion

PRICE FIVE CENTS.
president of the local celebration comrait
tee, presided over the assemblage. He inÂ«
troduced Arthur Briggs, president of the
Chamber of Commerce, who delivered the
address of welcome. The Valley road
officials occupied seats on the platform,
and to them in particular and the crowd
in general Mr. Briggs addressed his re
marks, speaking in behalf of the people of
Fresno. Said he :
Whhn I look at the earnest faces of this
great number ot people congregated here for a
single purpose â men and women of mature
years; young men and young women in the
prime of life ; yes, even the childrenâ l cannot
uoubt that this occasion is one of more than
ordinary importance to the city and to the
central part of the State.
That the occasion is not local in Its in te test
or significanceâ in the sense of Fresno County
alone â is shown by the large number who are
here from other towns and from the adjoining
counties to narticipate in this demonstration
and to rejoice with us in the good fortune ol
this city. This is substantial indication that
good fellowship obtains in this part of the
State, and that the fact is recognized tnat
whatever affects Fresno County and promote*
its welfare, by reason of close relation com
mercially find industrially, affects also the
people of the whole valley.
And what is more appropriate than that on
this holiday, dignified by the name of Labor
day, tbis gathering of the people should be
had? In this extreme portion of the conti
nent we are all laborers, and therefore have a
direct and personal interest in upholding the
dignity and supremacy of labor, which is the
recognized basis of ali development, of all
wealth and all happiness.
The thought of encouraging and sustaining
labor is near to the heart of every loyal Ameri
can, whether native or foreign born; so that
anything that widens the opportunity for
profitable employment, or which tends to de
velop, increase and multiply our industries,
or gives better facilities for handling and get*
to market the products of labor, whether in
the department of agriculture or manufac
tures, is vitally interesting to us, as it excites
he hope of improved industrial conditions.
The speaker pointed oat the opportunity
for the growth of the San Joaquin Valley.
He believed that the construction of the
â  Valley road was but the beginning of what
was to come. "Instead of one line con
trolling the freight and passenger traffic
hereafter," said, "two roads will vie with
each other in the carrying trade." Con
tinuing, Mr. Briggs said:
To you, gentlemen of the San Francisco and
San Joaquin Va'ley Railway Company, our
hearts are open to-day. The voice of welcome
resounds from one end 01 this valley to the
otner, ana bears to you evidence of good fel
lowship and appreciation of your work.
"With charity to all and malice toward
none," we are here to express to you a wel
come as genuine as it is spontaneous. \V#
bring to your door as evidence of our appre
ciation samples of the products which have
waited your coming. Memorable to us is the

meeting held In the Chamber of Cftmmerco in
San Francisco, when the giant of commerce,
Hon. Claus Spreckels, spoke in tones that
Bounded the length and breadth of the State,
and when that master of finance, Thomas
Brown of the Bank of California, gave to Mr.
Spreckels and to the project his support. It
was then we realized that the Keynote hud
been struck, nnd the belief vras established
that the Valley road would be built. Mr.
Spreckels has never put his hand to the plow
and turned back, nor has he ever been known
to speak until he is ready to Act.
And be It understood that we do not under
value the ability and influence of the other
gentlemen immediately connected with this
enterprise. >*o equal combination of men has,
perhaps, ever been associated in a single en
terprise in this State. All are well and widely
known. In the commercial history of Cali
fornia the names of Spreckels, Watt, Stetson,
Whittier, Hooper, Payson, Sloss, Hayward and
Upham are as household words. Through a
period of many years of close identification
with the important industries of the State
they have been conspicuous, and their names
are a synonym of business capacity, foresight
and commercial integrity.
Tbe speaker prophesied the formation
of a new State, with the present terminus
of the Valley road as its capital. Mr
Briggs concluded as follows:
When the eternal reservoir whjch the Crea
tor placed at the summit of the snow-clad
mountains, through nature's arteries supplied
its waters to all this great valley; when the
electric forces that have run riot through
canyon and forest and over mountain peaks
in the wilderness for ages have been chained,
as they soon will be, and made to do the bid
dine of our mills, worksnops, factories and
homes, and thus contribute to the comfort,
wealth arid happiness of those fortunate
enough to live in so favored a land; when the
population of the valley shall have increased
tenfold and we have seenred ten ii-.stead of
two railroads into Fresno, then, it is to be
hoped, this community will still hold in en
duriug rememberance the day and occasion
we are here to commemorate.
Ciaus Spreckels was next introduced by
Chairman Reichman. As the energetic
president of the railroad stepped forward
the people broke forth into long continued
cheers. One round did not suffice and
another was given. When the huzzahing
had subsided Mr. Spreckels spoke as fol
lows:
I thank you very much for the reception you
have given us. When I tee the people come
out so earnestly to receive this new enterprise
I feel more strongly than ever that this is the
people's railroad. It cannot be otherwise.
Where you have 1,500,000 people in this
valley to-day you ought to have 5,000,000.
The valley ought to have them. You have the
whole thing in your hands â whether this road
shall be a success or go down. If we make *>
per cent interest on 6ur investments we will
be satisfied. If our income amounts to more
we will cut rates further, so that the rate of
interest realized will be kept to the 6 per cent
limit.
For the present we cannot go further with
the construction of the road, but alter the
election we hope to issue bonds and extend
the railroad. Let us not be afraid of each
other; let us stand back to back and fight the
common cause together; let there be no petty
jealousies end let the people be a unit, and
then we shall have 5,000,000 people in this
glorious valley.
As Mr. Spreckels retired, Governor
Budd, who occupied a seat on tbe plat
form, arose and proposed three cheers for
the president of the Valley road. They
were given with a will. General Attorney
E. F. Preston was the next speaker. In
behalf of the directors of the road he
thanked tbe people of Fresno for the re
ception tendered them.
"The progress of the great valley has
been hampered," he said, "by a barrier
between it and tidewater, but now that
has been raised. The road wÂ«3 built for
the people, and if Ihey stand together, a3
they should do, the San Joaquin Valley
will be the greatest section in the world."
A MERRY FEAST.
Products of the San Jcaquln Val
ley Served to the City's
Guests.
FRESNO, Cal., Oct. s.â When the
speechmaking stopped at 3:30 o'clock
Chairman Reichman invited all to par
ticipate in tne barbecue, A second invita
tion to "pitch into" the succulent viands
was not needed. An acre of white tables
piled high with bread and spread with
glistening disnes was close to the plat
form. The crowd seemed to be made
hungry for San Joaquin Valley products
by long waiting. In about a minute not
a vacant seat was to be seen, and in about
thirty minutes the barbecue, the largest
ever held in the valley, was a sweet morsel
of recollection.
Men, women and children banqueted at
the feast. Tbe savory odor of cooking
meat had been detected in that vicinity
for forty-eight hours previously. It <vas
literally the feeding of a multitude. The
variety and amount consumed consisted
of 4000 pounds of meat, including beef,
pork and mutton, 2500 loaves of bread, 200
pounds or about 4000 cups of coffee, 200
pounds of sugar, several tons of such
crapes as only grow in the unparalleled
fertility of the San Joaquin. All disap
peared as miraculously as the Biblical
feast of the loaves and fishes. "Jim Smith"
was chef, assisted by a half dozen cooks.
Fifty men waited on the tables.
Here is a little incident which shows
how tbe Valley road is appreciated and
regarded as the forerunner of better times.
Carpenters Hiram Ford, A. Gale and A.
W. Deial gave their services to the bar
becue committee. They made ail the
tables ay.d trestles and erected the
speakers' stand.
After the barbecue there was a brief in
terval in tne general entertainment, but
at 5:30 o'clock a military parade, inspec
tion and review by Governor Budd and
staff came off according to programme.
This took place in front of the Hughes
Hotel on I street. Four companies of
State troops participated â C, Captain
George Duucan, and F, Captain G. W.
Jones, of Fresno; E, Captain F.
W. Ward, of Visalia, and H, Captain
Graham, of Merced. Each company had
about fifty men in line. The troops made
a splendid appearance. At the commands
of the officers intricate maneuvers were
executed with the regularity and precision
of clockwork. Governor Budd and staff
revieweu the troops from the sidewalk
and immediately after inspected them on
horseback on the Southern Pacific Rail
road Company's reservation.
The members of the Governor's staff
present were: General A. W. Barrett of
Sacramento, Colonel Peeler of Sacra
mento, Colonel Hansen of Pasadena, Colo
nel Young of San Francisco and Colonel
R. L. Dunn of San Francisco. The Third
Brigade staff present were: General Mul
ler, Colonel Hay and Major Nichols.
Others present and participating were
Major Colin Chisholm and Lieutenant-
Colonel S. S. Wright of Fresno.
An immense crowd witnessed the in
spection of the troops.
OFFICIALS BANQUETED.
Toasts Drunk to the Health of the
San Joaquln Valley Promoters. .
FRESNO, Cal., Oct. s.â lt was ? impossi
ble to disguise the fact throughout to-day's
celebration that Claus Spreckels was re
garded as the hero of the day and ; hour.
To-night ; there , was a . vast Â« concourse of
people in front the Hughes Hotel, at which
Governor .j Budd, Mr. Spreckels â  and " the
directors of tJaÂ» Valley road axe stof s in*, j
It had been announced on the street that
the Governor would make a speech.
When he appeared on the balcony with a
number of otr.ers his reception was en
thusiastic. That of Mr. Spreckels was
more so. The Governor eaid:
"I did not expect to make a speech
when I came here to-day. lam glad to
see the construction of the Valley road â
that which the people of Fresno and the
San Joaquin Valley have prayed for so
longâ accomplished. Tbe prosperity and
development of the valley has been de
layed by the tax placed upon its products."
The Governor said that ClauÃ Spreckels
should be held in the greatest veneration
by the people of the valley. [Applause.]
He referred to Mr. Spreckels having
"with one stroke of his r en subscribed
$500,000 to the railroad project, and his
two sons $200,000 more, making $700,000,"
putting the project on its feet.
"It depends on the people of the valley
whether they deserve the benefits of com
petition," he continued. "I understand
one farmer has saved $8000 in reduced
freight rates this year on account of the
Valley road."
The Governor predicted that in ten
years, with its cheap electricity for light
and power, there would not be a grander
or a more prosperous city in California
than Fresno.
"People are now livine," he said, "who
will uee t= . is valley teeming with the mil
lions of people it is capable of supporting.
This is Fresno's greatest day. It is a day
which it should celebrate year in and year
out, and have in a few years in fact what
it has in name in a club, a population of
100,000." [Cheers.]
Then Claus Spreckels was loudly called
for. He finally appeared, climbing
through a window. "Three cheers for
Spreckels" was the shout and the crowd
responded with a vim.
"I can't make any speeches," said Mr.
Spreckels, "but I can help you out.
[ Cberrs.J I am not a native of California,
but there is no other place for me than
California. [Cheers.] I have tried to do
in my old age as much for you and Cali
fornia as I can. The younger people here
will live to see 10,000,000 people in this
valley â live to see California the greatest
State in the Union."
Governor Budd Â«arose to his feet and,
swinging his hat, called for 'Three
cheers for Bpreckels and the directors of
the Valley Railway." They were given
with great enthusiasm. There were other
speeches Dy attorney E. F. Preston,
Levinsky, Miles Wallace and others. The
speeches of the evening boomed the Val
ley road even more than those of tbe
afternoon.
The banquet at the Hughes Hotel in the
evening was the culmination of the day's
festivities. It was the most elegant and
eloquent affair of its kind that
has ever taken place in the raisin cen
ter. It was given by the members
of the Hundred Thousand Club and the
Chamber of Commerce in honor of the dis
tinguished guests of the city â the Valley
road officials and Governor Budd and tbe
other visitors from San Francisco and
Stockton. About 350 Bat at tbe tables.
John Reichman, president of the Cham
ber of Commerce, apted as master of cere
monies.
The following were the toasts: "The
State of California," by Governor Bndd;
"The San Francisco and San Joaquin Val
ley Railway Company," James D. Phelan;
"Committee of Ten," A. J. Pediar; "Com
mittee of Three," George L. War
low; "San Joaquin EUctric Company,"

WHEELMEN IN LINE.
Riders Mounted on Decorated
Bicycles Parade the Streets
at Night.
FRESNO, Cal., Oct. 5 âTo-night there
was a granu illuminated bicycle parade
through the principal streets. Over 250
wheels were in line, many of the sur
rounding colonies being represented.
Emory Donahoe was grand 'marshal. The
prizes for the best decorated wheels were
awarded as follows: First prize, a
gold watch, to L. O. Stevens, a brilliantly
illuminated fan of unique design ; second,
two bicycle suits, a tandem ridden by
Frank Kiefker and Charles Reid, illum
inated boat; third, a bicycle suit, State
Senator A. J. Pedlar, illuminated bower of
pampas grass.
The streets were so jammed with people
that there was scarcely room for the parade
to move. The decorations were frequently
cheered. The city was brilliantly illu
minated by several hundred extra electric
lights by the San Joaquin Electric Com
pajy. The excursion train left for Stock
ton at 7 o'clock to-night. Many of the
the excursionists remained in the city over
night.
HISTORY OF THE ROAD.
Hasty Glance at Striking Events
Along the Pathway of Its
Progress.
The history of the Valley Railroad really
began upon the day when Claus Spreckels,
John D. Spreckels and Adolph Spreckels
subscribed sufficient suras to make it pos
sible to rally other support to the enter
prise, and to afford a guarantee that the
line, long desired and much discussed,
would be actually constructed. Had they
not upon that occasion led the way tbe
Valley Railroad would, in all probability,
have been far from in existence still. In
fact, it was generally recognized when a
meeting was called by tbe Traffic Associa
tion of California on January 17, 1895, to
be held January 22, tbat unless decisive
action was taken at tbat time the long
struggle for the establishment of a com
peting rail line must be abandoned indefi
nitely.
Isaac Upham, then the president of tbe
Traffic Association, in hit call for the
meeting of January 22, 1896, wrote as fol
lows:
"Some of our friends feel quite discour
aged, but I for one do not feel like giving
up the fight yet. 'We should continue the
work for at least thirty days longer. We
should submit this matter to real estate
owners, merchants and every one who is
interested in the prosperity of this City,
and if they say 'no, we will not sub
scribe,' tbe failure is not our fault and toe
blame must rest on those who refuse."
Tbe situation was indeed desperate, and
other extracts from Mr. Upbam'e call for
tbe meeting show that clearly. "We are
completely at the mercy of one corpora
tion, and I cannot believe that tbe people
of this City will allow this golden oppor
tunity to pass by without taking advan
tage of it. Tbe people of the San Joaquin
Valley are watching our movements very
closely. They cannot understand why it
takes au long to raise the small amount of
$350,000, when this amount should have
been raised in three days.
"We are fast losing ground, and unless
something is done quickly the trade of the
, Saa JoaQUin Yalle/ will be lost to San
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 6, 1896.
.Francisco. Goods from here have even
been shipped there via Los Angeles."
Tbe programme was, as had been enun
ciated by Mr. Upham, to try for perhaps
thirty days more to raise subscriptions
amounting to $350,000 as the basis of incor
porating a railroad between Stockton and
Fresno. Should the proper Bupport fail
to be afforded the efforts of ihe Traffic
Association to build a railroad would
cease at that time. The Tratfic Associa
tion of California performed splendid serv
ice for the State in the line ol instituting
competition with the Southern Pacific
Company in the carrying trade.
To that association was due the
formation and maintenance of the
"North American Navigation Company,
and in its rooms members of the
Traffic Association also formed the
Merchants' Shipping Association, which
put on a competing clipper ship line via
Cape Horn between San Francisco and
New York. With the Traffic Association
also originated the attempt to raise money
to build the San Francisco and Great Salt
Lake Railway, and the association, ad
vised by Joseph S. Leeds, its traffic man
ager, tried on two separate occasions to get
funds with which to build a road through
the San Jonquin Valley. Both of these
attempts failed of any degree of realisa
tion. The first dropped out of sight when,
the time having elapsed in which sub
scriptions were binding, all pledges were
canceled.
The second attempt reached the stage of
securing only a part of the $350,000 pledged
that was nececsary to incorporate a rail
road to be 350 miles long, at the rate of
$1000 per mile. The Traffic Association,
through its president Isaac Upham, issued
the call which resulted in the memorable
meeting of January 22, 1895, in the hall of
the Chamber of Commerce.
Nearly all the members or the Traffic
Association were present. Isaac Upliam
called that meeting to order and told what
had been done and what the Traffic Asso
ciation thought was necessary to be done.
The construction of a road from Stockton
to Bakersfield. he said, wouldcost $3,500,
--000. Only $350,000 would be necessary to
begin operation.
The remarks that followed were made
by E. B. Pond, Traffic Manager Joseph S.
Leeds, Thomas Magee, M. W. Belshaw,
Daniel Meyer, S. N. Grifhth, A. P. Wil
iiams. E. F. Preston, John T. Doyle and
Robert Watt. The time arrived for action
and the action taken was radical.
Claus Spreckels spoke briefly, but with
effect. He did not believe that raising
$305,000 would be ample. "Make it $3,000,
--000," he said, "and 1 will put my name
down for $500,000."
His plan was adopted. The work of the
Traffic Association of California as an as
sociatipn in the direction of building a
road stopped then and there. Around
Claus Bpreckels rallied,. however, all those
who had been prominent as movers in the
Traffic Association. They were overjoyed
at the success which had attended their
move. Before the meeting was adjourned
a committee of twelve was named to se
cure subscriptions for the stock of the
competing line. The members of that
committee were as follows: Claus
Spreckels, James D. Phelan, O.D.Bald
win, Daniel Meyer, W. F. Whittier, Al
bert Miller, John T. Doyle, E. F. Preston,
Charles Holbrook, Thomas Magee. James
I* Flood and Alexander Boyd. The com
mittee was increased later and included,
in addition to those already named: J. P.
Martin, Levi Strauss, Adam Grant, Isaac
Upham, A. B. MsCreery, J. B. Stetson,
John D. Spreckels, Lewis Gerstle, Antoine
Borel and C. de Guigne. /
From the time of the first meeting at
the Chamber of Commerce Hall on the
offices of Claus Spreckeis were for some
weeks the scene of continued enthusiasm.
There were almost daily meetings there
of the committee to get subscriptions,
andthe money came in very encouraging
ly. Claus Spreckels presided over many
of these meetings. The 29th day of Jan
uary, 1895, will long be remembered by
those who were striving to build a com
petitive railroad for the purpose of in
creasing the prosperity of the State. At
that time the following was made public
which described the purpose in view and
briefly recapitulated what had been ac
complished:
A meeting of citizens interested in proper
ties and other values in San Francisco was
called by the Traffic Association of California
to meet at the Chamber of Commerce on the
22d day of January, 1895, to consider what
ways and means might be devised for the con
strue ion of a railroad between the bay of
SanFranctsco and the southern extremity of
the San Joaquln Valley, to the end that the
people of the State of California might receive
the benefit of a competitive railway line
through this large and fertile country.
At this meeting a committee was appointed
to take charge of the matter, and such com
mittee met and organized on the 24th day of
January by the election of Claus tipreckels as
Chairman.
Conferences have been held from doy to day
since tbat lime and gentlemen were from time
to time invited to co-operate and were added
to that committee.
Having matured a plan, the committee now
presents the same to the people of the State of
California for their consideration. You are
asked to subscribe to this enterprise the sum
of $2,000,000 before the incorporation of the
company, which it is proposed to capitalize at
$6,000,000, the estimated cost of the proposed
construction. With this sum in hand the con
struction of the road is assured and you are
called upon as citizens and Californians to
respond to the call and aid in completing this
subscription at the earliest practicable mo
ment. The cooperation of every man is de
sired and is necessary.
The committee who presents this proposition,
to you is neither promoters, contractors, build
ers nor owners of railroads. The entire scheme
and project is as novel to them as to you, and
the moving impulse with them, as it must be
with you. has been the good, the advancement,
the future and the prosperity of the State of
California. The proposition is to make it a
people's road, owned by the people and oper
ated in the interests of the people, and it is to
you as % part of the people that we turn for
assistance.
The subscription list for stock in the
Valley road was formally opened at this
meeting. Claus Spreckels signed for $500,
--000, John D. Spreckels for $100,000, A. B.
Spreckels for $100,000, John D. Spreckels
(as* attorney) for $100,000, Aivinza Hay
ward and W. F. Whittier for $50,000 each.
There were many other subscriptions of
good size, and the total subscriptions for
the first day amounted to $1,025,000.
Among large subscriptions received were
tbe following: Hobart Estate Company,
$50,000; HibÂ»rnia Bank, $50,000; Abbey
M. Parrott, $50,000; San Francisco and
Fresno Land Company (Bank of Caliior
nia), $25,000; San Francisco Savings
Union, $50,000; James D. Phelan, $25,000;
James L. Flood, $25,000; Joseph A. Dono
hoe, $25,000; Daniel Meyer, $25,000; Levi
Strausa, $25,000; Adam Grant, $25,000;
Antoine Borel, $25,000; A. B. McCreery,
$30,000; Charles Holbrook, $20,000; the
Hearst estate, $25,000.
When the first eeneral meeting of the
stockholders of the Valley road was held
in the Chamber of Commerce Hall,
Charles Holbrook presiding,E. F. Preston,
secretary, announced that the subscrip
tions amounted to $2,248,000. This meet
ing tooK place February 20, less than one
month from the meeting which the Traffic
Association had brought about to de
termine what course should be pursued in
reference to the railroad.
The following were named as incorpora
tirs of the road: Clans Spreckels, W. F.
Whittier, Charles Holbrook, John T.
D.iyle and E. F. Preston. The following
were elected on the first board of direct
ors: Claus Spreckels, president; W. F.
Wjiittier, first vice-president; Robert
Watt, second vice-president; John D.
Spreckels, J. B. Stetson, Charles Hol
brooK, Leon Sloss, Aivinza Hayward. Isaac
Upham, A. H. Paysou, Thomas Magee,
E. F. Preston, attorney. The articles of
incorporation were filed February 25, 1895,
and the projectors of the road were ready
to begin to consider what was to be done
and to do it. Alexander Mackie was
elected the first secretary and W. B.
Storey Jr. was named as engineer.
How the road secured the China Basin
for terminal purposes in San Francisco is
wall known. It had been wisely deter
mined by the board of directors not to
build until the terminal facilities had been
made sure. Claus Spreckels said that
unless the terminal could be had the build
ing of tbe road might as well be abandoned.
The Legislature passed the bill for the
lease of the water-front property, the vote
in the Senate being quite close,' 20 to 16.
When the case came before the Board of
Harbor Commissioners, Governor Budd
and Mayor Sutro sat (ex-officio) as mem
bers of tbe board and took an active part
in the proceedings. After full explana
tions and able presentation of the facts,
the Harbor Commissioners granted the
lease.
Toward the end of March an agreement
was reached under which the road wa3
pledced to be operated competitively for a
period of years. Under this agreement a
board of trustees was appointed, consti
tuted as follows: Adolph B. Spreckels,
Daniel Meyer, James D. Phelah, Lovell
White, James Cross, Thomas Brown, F.
W. Van Sicklen, Christian de Guigne and
O. D. Baldwin.
Events progressed rapidly. A contract
for construction engines was placed as
early as May 22, 1395. The action of interior
communities can hardly be detaired in the
space allotted to this article. Stockton
subscribed for stock amounting to $100,
--000 and donated money, land and rierhts
of way. The lease of the China Basin was
signed July 8, 1895. The first cargo of rails
arrived at San Francisco on the day pre
ceding tbe signing of the lease, and on the
day following contracts were let for grad- I
ing the road through the city of Stockton
and for all bridges to the Stanislaus River.
On the same day condemnation suits for
rights of way to the river were begun.
Wherever it has been possible all contracts
for materials, etc., have been awarded to
Californians, thus carrying ont to the
fullest extent the idea of benefiting Cali
fornia as much as possible in the con
struction as well as in the operation of the
road.
The proeress of the road from the break
ing of ground at Stockton to the extension
of tbe line southward to Fresno has been
so well recorded from time to time that it
is not necessary to recapitulate, all this
being of common knowledge. Pursuant
to the plan of capitalization tbe directors
have voted bonds sufficient to extend the
line from Fresno to Bakersfield and from
Stockton to San Francisco. When this is
done the Pacific Coast metropolis will be
in direct communication with the richest
valley of California throuehout its entire
extent. What the policy of the road will
be and what this policy will mean to pro
ducers and shippers to San Francisco and
to all points affected, in the increase of
business and in the development of the
State and of this City are apparent. The
reduced rates made by the Valley road
will effect an annual saying of many
thousands of dollars and will invite immi
gration and make development not only
possible but certain.
RAISINS ARRIVE.
Dawn of a New Era for the Fresno
Growersâ En Route for Aus
tralia.
A significant shipment arrived in San
Francisco yesterday.
It was no less than the first carload of
raisins shipped from Fresno over the Val
ley road. They were consigned to
F. B. Peterson & Co., some of
which are to be transhipped for Aus
tralia, and the boxes, containing prime
"London layers" and other grades of
Fresno's prize fruit, were piled on Pacific
street wharf. There were 1500 boxes in
all and yesterday, being a holiday, they
were left undisturbed. To-day, however,
the stevedores will make up for lost time
in putting them aboard the Mariposa for
the Antipodes.
The shipment was regarded by mer
chants as marking a notable epoch in the
raisin industry. Hitherto there has not
been much effort made, in view of the
heavy freight charged by the Southern
Pacific, to extend tbe export trade of
raisins. As one of California's staples,
the dried fruit of the State, and especially
raisins, have been found able to compete
with the product of any other section
of the globe. Fruitmen say that now
the Valley road having forced transpor
tation rates to a reasonable figure, the
dried-fruit industry will be largely stimu
lated and a beneficial result will be felt all
over the State.
MANY BISHOPS PRESENT
Semi â¢ Annual Meeting of the
Woman's Auxiliary Well
Attended^
Encouraging Reports of All tbe
Pacific Coast Dioceses and the
New Hospital-
The semi-annual conference of the Cali
fornia State Branch of the Woman's
Auxiliary of the Episcopal Church was
held in Trinity Episcopal Church yester
day afternoon. Prior to the meeting the
executive board held a private session and
outlined the work for the succeeding year.
Bishop Nichols presided at the meeting.
Delegates were present from the various
parishes of San Francisco, Oakland, Ala
meda and Berkeley. In his opening ad
dress Bishop Nichols reviewed in general
the work of the last year, and stated tbat
he thought it advisable for the Bishops'
auxiliary fund to receive $50 a month till
next year. It is probable that this will be
granted.
Bishop Barter of tbe Olympian diocese
of Washington gave a brief address on the
institutions and work there. He was fol
lowed by Bishop Johnson of Los Angeles,
who spoke encouragingly of tbe progress
made along the Santa Fe route from Mo
jave to Needles regarding church work.
Bishop Leonard of the Nevada and
Utah diocese explained in a very inter
esting manner how the work of the aux
iliary was carried on there. He also made
mention of the new $50,000 hospital
located at Salt Lake City.
Bishop Kendrick of the Arizona and
New Mexico diocese stated tbat he had
heard much in regard to the progress
made in matters religious in this State,
but was agreeably surprised to find that it
exceeded bis greatest expectations.
Mrs. James Newlands, the State presi
dent, told of what had been done and the
aims of the organization for tbe future.
The meeting was closed with prayer by
Bishop Nichols.

FREE SILVER YET THE SONG.
But Hs Says Hj Would Retire if the
Interests of the Party Should
Demand It.
MEMPHIS, Tens., Oct. s.â William J.
Bryan reached Memphis at 7:10 o'clock
this rqorning from St. Louis, accompanied
by the members of tbe Memphis reception
committee and Senator-elect H. D. Money
of Mississippi, Representative John Allen
of Mississippi and Benton McMillan of
Tennessee. All through the night crowds
of people had gathered about the train at
its stopping places and cheered for the
candidate, who did not appear. Several
hundred people cheered Mr. Bryan at the
Poplar-street station here this morning,
and he was also greeted with enthusiasm
along the streets on his way to the Pea
body Hotel, where he had breakfast.
The visit of Mr. Bryan was made the
occasion of a general holiday. Business
houses closed their doore and even the
bants suspended for the day. At 10:20
o'clock Mr. Bryan under escort of the
Neely Zouaves reached Overton Tract, a
big open field, where be found a crowd
estimated at 15,000. As he mounted the
covered platform erected in the center of
tbe field the old rebel yell was heard on
all sides. Senator Harris presented Mr.
Bryan, who said in part:
In Memphis it wasâ something more than a
year ago â that this fight whicn is being waged
now was begun; that is, it was In this city
that those in favor of the gold standard met
to begin the work of capturing the two great
political parties, and it was here, a few days
afterward, that the silver forceps gathered to
begin the organization of their campaign.
[Cheers.] Therefore, at this time, when the
campaign has progressed so far tbat we are
able to form some estimate ol the result, lam
glad to tome again to the city which has been
known in history because of the silver cam
paign which was commenced here.
Various plans were suggested, and we met
in Chicago and decided to attempt, first, to
carry all the political parties to free coinage,
and if we failed in that, then to find some way
to consolidate the vote of those in iavor of
free Silver. [Cheers.]
I remember that 1 was in doubt as to the
means that might be found, and I explained
my doubt as to the means, and yet my confi
dence as to the result I expressed by quoting
from one of the Sunday-school congresses, '"It
may not be my way; it may not be thy way;
but in his way the Lord will provide." [Great
cheering.] .
Mr. Bryan then spoke eulogistically of
the services to bimetallism contributed by
E. W. Carmack, candidate for Congress
against Josiah Patterson, the incumbent,
wno is a gold Democrat, but supported
the Chicago ticket, and continued:
I am grateful to those who have been ear
nestly in conviction, earnest enough in their
desire to restore the standard coinage of the
constitution. While I appreciaie the honor
which has been conferred upon me, not only
In the nomination by my own party, but by the
additional nomination of two other parties, I
say to you here, my friends, that my interest
in the cause of bimetallism is so deep that I
would without a moment's hesitation resign
in favor of any person in the United States
who can better carry this cause to victory.
[Cheers.]
It is not a time to listen to personal ambi
tions. It is not a time when we are to con
sider the temporary effect of this election upon
party organization. It is. a time when we are
to consider tue effect of the gold standard if
perpetuated on party organizations; not on
this country alone, but on all mankind.
[Cneers.]
My friends, I want to impress upon your
minds another thing. It is not only necessary
tbat we shall elect a President and Vice-Presi
dent in iavor ot free coinage, but It is neces
sary that there shall be a Congress in favor of
Iree coinage. [Cheers.] If you are in earnest
in your desire lor bimetallism, you must show
that earnestness by doing anything necessary
to be done to elect Congress, Senate and
President.
If we are right in the position we have taKen ;
if the Democratic. party is right in its platform,
then the man who does not stand upon that
platform, no matter how good a Democrat he
may have been before, is no Democrat now.
[Applause.] And no man can claim to be a
friend of mine who says he wants to elect me
because I am a regular nominee and then go
down there and tie my hands and mate me
powerless. [Applause.] And therefore my
candidacy appeals to every American citizen
who believes in the right of the people of this
country to govern themselves regardless of
the aid or consent of any other nation on
earth. lam not appealing to any sentiments
hostile to foreigners, but I say to you, my
friends, that that nation does not deserve to
be called a nation which accepts a financial
policy "ready made^from other countries.
Our opponents say that the tariff question is
the important issue of this campaign. I tell
them that until tneyputa prohibitive tariff
on foreign financiers I won't talk tariff with
them. [Applause]. But until we have vindi
cated the right of this people to legislate for
themselves on every issue they cannot drive
tariff into this people with a pileariver.
Mr. Bryan then spoke on the lines of
his well -known argument beginning,
"The Republican platform does not say
the gold standard ia a good thing." He
talk d about a rising dollar and a falling
dollar and about a dollar being too good,
following familiar lines. On the conclu
sion of his speech Mr. Bryan was con
veyed to the Louisville and Nashville
station, accompanied by a great crowd,
and at 12:20 p. m. left for' Nashville.
NASHVILLE, Tens., Oct. 5. â Three
speeches wera the ta3k Mr. Bryan found
before him when he reached Nashville at
8:35 o'clock to-night. Tiie railroad station
and the streets in its vicinity were
thronged when his train rolled in from
Memphis and all along the route to the
Haymarket, where the first speech was
made, deep lines of people cheered him.
An artillery salute was fired and twenty
six clubs from places in Middle Tennessee
were in line, on foot and on horseback.
About 300 students from the university
also turned out. Excursion trains had
been bringing in big crowds all day and
thousands of strangers augmented the
crowds of Nashville people on the streets.
The Haymarket is a spacious enclosure
and the figures given of the audience to
night range from 25,000 to 40,000. The
gathering was wildly enthusiastic. Sen-,
ator Bate presented Mr. Bryan woo spoke
as follows :
It war my good fortune to visit Nashville
more than a year ago, when we were beginning
the fight which resulted in securing the con
trol of the Democratic National Convention.
I remember with pleasure my visit then,
and it gratifies me much on returning to
find that the sentiment in favor of the im
mediate restoration of the free and unlim
ited coinage of both gold and silver at the
present legal ratio of 16 to 1, without waiting
for the aid or consent of any nation on earth,
expanded, until to-day a vast majority of the
people of Tennessee are" arrayed undei a
doubre-standard banner. I beg to thank the
young men who have opened this meeting
with our campaign song â our battle hymn, it
might be calledâ for in this fight for the de
fense of the hornet of thousands, the humble
as well as the palatial home, we well might
tace as our battle hymn that most beautiful of
all songs, "Home, Sweet Home."
Our warfare ia in one sense aggressive; In
another sense it is defensive. It is aggressive
in the sense that we are aaJting for remedial
legislation. It is aggressive in the sense that
we are insisting that something shall be done,
and it ia defensive in the sense that we are fight
ing for our homes and our people against an in
vasion of a iorrtgn tinancial policy. [Cheers.l
As I passed throueh the streets to-night and
listened to the exclamations of the people I
could easily believe that I was in a city so near
to that sacred spot, the Hermitage. [Cheers.]
I can understand, why the people of this
State should feel so deep an interest in
the cause which is represented by the
Chicago platform, because'we are fighting to
day the battle that Andrew Jackson fought
when he was in office. [Great cheers.] we
find arrayed against us tbe same combina
tions, the same aggregation of wealth, the
same abuse aeainst him ; we suffer from the
same abuse that he suffered from. Every
name Is applied to the advocates of free coin
age that -was applied to old Hickory when he
fought for the American people. [Great
cheers.] In declaring in favor of bimetal
lism we stand upon ancient ground. The |
free coinage, of silver is no experiment. It
is indorsed by the history of the humau |
race, it has the sanction of all the great
statesmen of this Nation from the beginning
of our history do.\ n to 1873. No person will
assert that America abandoned bimetallism
after a full discussion. If you rend the records
of the time you will find thai the newspapers, ;
which are so quick to grasp upon any item oi I
news, so ready to spread it before the pnb.lc, â 
did not understand that the law of 1873 de
monetizÂ«d silver, closed the mints to the .
coinage of the white metal and left us with |
gold only as our standard money. Ever since
that day we have been seeking to undo what
was done in the dark.
My friends: We have lost some Democrats
in this light, but I am mighty glad that most
of those whom we lost were generals. v\e
have not lost many privates iv the army. [Ap- |
piause 1 We might have kept all the Dem
ocrats who are gone if we had been willing to
pay the price they asked. If we had been
willing to make the Democratic party the
agent to fasten plutocracy upon the American
people we could have kept every man who has
left us. But we have to choose between ihrow
lng overboard those who have been millstones
about the neck of Democracy and throwing
over the D rcocracy itself, and we prefer to
save Democracy and let the aristocrats go.
[Great cheering.]
My friends, we have not lost it. It has been
our gain. It is also true that those who dare
to do right are rewarded in the long run, and
the Democratic party is receiving its reward
not even waiting for the long runâ it is re
ceiving its reward right now for daring to do
ripht at Chicago. [Cheers.]
We are drawing iv our ranks those who are
in the Republican party for bimetallism.
They have come to us because they nee now
that the hope of international bimetallism ia
a delusion and that it is used only as a cover,
while the leading Republicans are attempttng
to fasten the gold standard permanently upon
the people.
Mr. Bryan also spoke of the Populist ap
proval of the cause. Mr. Bryan talked for
an hour and was then taken to the Ath
letic Park. He fonnd an immense throng
there, and almost as big as that at the
Haymarket. His speech at Athletic Park
waa very brief.
The third address was a Populist meet
ing in the public square. At midnight
Mr. Bryan left for Indianapolis. Great
crowds greeted Mr. Bryan in his eight
hours' journey through Tennessee to-day.
People thronged at every stÃtion where
stops were made. Arlington was the
first stop after leaving Memphis, and
several hundred people there pressed
around the platform of the candidate s
car to shake hands with him. Browns
ville turned out a large crowd. At Hum
boidt Mr. Bryan spoke to a crowd number
ing 6000 or 7000. A pathway for the can
didate from the train to the stand was
lined with young girls wearing Bryan
and Sewall caps, blue blouses and white
skirts, who waved Hags and shouted a
shrill welcome.
Three thousand demonstrative people
were at Milan, and they, too, heard a little
speech. Mackenzie had even a larger
crowd. Mr. Bryan spoke from the rear
platform pf the" train to quite a large au
dience at Huntington. Camden heard a
minute speech from the candidate. It
was just beginning to grow dark and bon
nres lighted up the landscape. "Waverly
and Dickson also turned out fair-sized
crowds of cheerers. \

Austin of the Order of Railway Tel
egraphers has received dispatches from
point! on the Canadian Pacific rodd which,
he asserts, show that the tie-op is prac

quantities of time goods, as well as perish
able property, are lying on different di

GREAT FRIENDSHIP DISPLAYED
President Faure and the Leading Dip
lomats of the Nation Receive
the Royal Visitors.
CHERBOURG, Fbanck, Oct. sâ Tbe
Czar and Czarina arrived here from Ports
mouth, England, at 2 o'clock this afternoon
and were given a frantic ovation by the
immense crowds that had assembled near
the Bassin dv Commerce, the Avant Porte
and the quays in that vicinity.
The weather was stormy throughout the
- night and early this morning and rain was
falling heavily. This bad a bad effect on
the many beautiful decorations but did
not dampen the enthusiasm of the multi
tude," wnich, armed with umbrellas, -early
sought points of vantage from which they
could not be driven by the weather.
Along the route from the Quay de l'An
cien Arsenal, which fronts the eastern side
of the Avant Porte, to tne railway station
were numberless Venetian marts which
presented a handsome sight last night, but
. which looked bedraggled after hav
ing been exposed to the storm: Many of
them were blown down by a heavy squall
during the night and a Jarge force of
workmen were put at work early to replace
them as far as possible.
All night long thousands of persons of
all ages and conditions flocked into the
town from all parts of the interior, and
tne trains that arrived this morning
brought thousands more. The streets were
literally packed, but the crowds were
orderly and good natured. Every one ap
peared to be anxious to show friendship
for the great ally of France, and as the
hour approached that had been fixed for
the Czar's arrival feverish excitemept pre
vailed among the thousands close to the
water front.
The eastern and western jetties and tbe
places at the entrance to the Avant Port
were black with humanity. None bat
favored individuals, however, were allowed I
on these places, for from them the first
and best views of the approaching naval
procession could be seen, and the yacht
Polar Star, bearing the Czar and Czarina
and their suites, passed ud to the Quai de
L'Ancien Arsenal through the two jetties.
Large numbers of gendarmes were every
where, but they had no difficulty in keep
ing order, as the crowds were very tract
able.
A stiff gale was blowing outside the
harbor all morning and a rery high sea
wus running, which made the crossing of
the channel a most unpleasant experience
for those not used to sea voyages.
It is recalled that the Czar was a very
good sailor, he having made a voyage al
most around the world while he was Csar
ewitch, but much sympathy was expressed
for the Czarina, who, in addition to being
in delicate health, is unused to sea voy
ages. A storm signal was flying on the
breakwater and altogether the weather
conditions were most inauspicious.
At 8 o'clock the French northern
squadron left the roadstead and headed
across the channel for the purpose of
meeting the Russian yachts and British
varships accompanying them. The
squadron was re-enforced by warships from
Rochefort and Brest. They all proceeded
to about the middle of the channel, where
they drew up and awaited the coming of
the Ctar.
At about noon signals on the breakwater
announced that the Polar Star had been
sighted and the enthusiasm of the crowd
broke forth in a mighty cheer. Prior to
this, however, the crowd knew the yacht
was approaching, for there had been
faindy beard the deep booming of the
guns from the French and British war
ships as they met off shore.
As the vessels approached the break
water tbe Polar Star was seen to be mak
ing heavy weather of it, sometimes pitch
ing almost bows under. Despite this, as
the yacht passed into the harbor past the
breakwater tbe Czar was seen standing on
the bridge wrapped in a storm-proof
cloak.
As the Polar Star passed in the forts on
the breakwater thurfdered forth an im
perial salute and the crowds ashore broke
forth in wild cheering. The warships
passed ahead of the yacht in the haroor
and ranged themselves in two lines,
through which the Polar Star steamed
slowly to the Quai de l'Ancien Arsenal,
followed by the Standart. As the Polar
Star pa3Â«ed the bands on the French war
ebips played the Russian national antnem.
The Piussian standard was at the heads of
their foremasts and aÂ« it was broken out
an imperial palute was fired.
On the quay awaiting the coming of
their Majesties were President Faure, at
tired in evening dress, with the ribbon of
the Legion of Honor. There were also
present M. Challemel-Lacour, President of
the Senate; M. Bnsson, President of the
Chamoer of Depnties; M. Meline, Presi
dent of the Council of Ministers and Min
ister of Agriculture; M. Hanotaux, Mm.
. ister of Foreign Affairs, and a large num
ber of high naval and military officers.
M. Meline wore the green decoration of
the Merite Agricole. M. Hanotaux was
attirei in diplomatic uniform with the red
decoration of the Russian order of St.
Andrew.
Baron de Mohrenheim, Russian Embas
sador to France, and Count Lannes de
Montebeilo, French Kmbassador to Rus
sia, Admiral Besnard, Minister of Marine,
with his newly obtained star of the Legion
of Honor, and the staff appointed to at
tend the Czar and Czarina while they
ate in France, were also present.
Owinc to the high wind and rough water
great difficulty was experienced in getting
the Polar Star alongside the quay. During
the maneuvering to get her in position for
the landing of her august passengers the
i vast multitude in the vicinity were very
I quiet, but when the gangway was finally
in position and the Czarina stepped onto
the quay, followed almost immediately by
the Czar, shouts of "Long live the Czar,"
"Long live Russia, 1 ' rent the air, and were
repeated again and again, and the crowd
shouted itself hoarse in the enthusiasm of
its welcome to the great friend of France.
As the Czarina stepped ashow President
Faure presented her with a beautiful floral
offering and uttered a few cordial words of
welcome, after bowing to and kissing the
hand of her Majesty.
The Czar was attired in the uniform of
a naval officer and wore on his breast the
grand Cross of the Legion of Honor. As
he landed on the quay President Faure
stepped forward and greeted him. The
Czar extended his hand, and after a hearty
handshake the President in a few happily
chosen words welcomed him to France.
The Czar replied briefly, after which Mr.
Faure gave his arm to the Czarina and
walked to the reception-room in the arse
nal, where the distinguished personages
present were introduced. The rooms in
the arsenal were handsomely decorated.
The first salon was furnished in crimson
satin and decorated with naval trophies.
The second or diplomatic salon, was fur
nianed in yellow satin, with flowers and
magnificent mirrors, leading into two spa
cious cabinets de toilette. The dining
room was furnished in pale green satin,
artillery trophies and models of torpedo
and naval machinery. In tnis room there
was a table of honor in the Louis XIV
style to seat only about fifteen, together
with two other tables seating sixty more.
Shortly after the imperial couple had
landed the sun broke through the clouds,
and this was taken as a happy augury.
The Czar and Czarina had a short rest be
fore 6 o'clock, at which hour a magnifi
cent banquet was spread in the dining
hall. It was the original intention that
the imperial party should traverse the
streets of the city, but the unpleasant state
of the weather forbade this, arid at 8
o'clock the Czar and Czarina and their
suites boarded the special train that was
awaiting them, a track naviug been
specially laid there to the railway station,
and started for Paris. President Faure,
the Ministers and other high officials pro
ceeded for Paris on the train on whioh
they traveled to Cherbourg last night.
TaKen alto^etUer, the reception to the
imperial visitors here was one long to be
remembered, and must have impressed
the Czar with the great friendship enter
tained for him by the French, not alone
the official class, but by all the people.
GREAT ORDON IN PARIS.
Lively Times Ahead for the Police Dur
ing the Parade.
PARIS, France, Oct. s.â The boule
vards this evening presented a remarkable
sight It had been stormy in the early
part of the day ana this caused the
greatest discomfort to the thousands of
visitors who had been unable to secure
lodgings in tbe city or vicinity. Toward
evening the weather that had given
promise of clearing in the early afternoou
became fine and then the principal streets
became fairly jammed with people. Ail
the cafes on the boulevards were uncom
fortably crawded and a steady stream of
people flowed along the sidewaiks and
frequently overflowed into the roadways.
Gay crowds gathered abont the places
where workmen were hurriedly engaged
in finishing the decorations ana jokes and
jests were freely indulged in.
Throughout the night hawkers traveled
tbe streets sellinsr portraits of the Czar
and Czarina, for which there was a great
demand. It is estimated that there are
fully 1,000,000 strangers in the city. The
crowds are very orderly. To-morrow will
be a general holiday in honor of the Czar.
Every precaution has been taken for the
safety of the nation's guest. The route
of the procession through tne city will be
lined with troops who will keep the line
within the strictest discipline. Behind
the troops will be stationed policemen who
will face tbe crowd, thus bein â¢ in a posi
tion to seize any seditious shouter or of
fender against the majesty of the Czar.
BABY FARMING AT CHICAGO
Bodies of Three Infants Found in
the River Near Harrison-
Street Bridge.
While the Stream Is Being Dragged
Detectives Are Locking for
the Murd rers.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. s.â Three dead
babies have been taken from the Chicago
River near Harrison-3treet br.dge since
last Thursday, and men are at work drag
ging the stream to ascertain whether more
bodies lie on the muddy bottom. The po
lice believe that the search will be success
ful. Then search will be made at the
other bridges.
The bodies that were found were in a
fair state of preservation. They had been
in the water for some time, but not long
enough to prevent an autopsy being made.
When tbe doctors examined the little
bodies they found that in each case the
child had been alive when thrown into
the river and that death had been caused
by drowning.
Tbe authorities are fully convinced that
the dead babies are the victims of one of
the horrible baby farms which from time
to time are discovered. It is believed that
the baby farms exist somewhere in the
lower part of the city and that babies are
taken from it at night, carried to one of
the bridges over the river and quietly
dropped into the water. It is this belief
that has caused tbe police to have the
river dragged both at Harrison-street
bridge and at the other bridges, and it is
this belief that causes the authorities to
think that other bodies will be found.
On none of the babies was there anything
to lead to the identification of the victims.
Still the police are not without hope of
being able to trace the crime. Some of
the best detectives on the force are at
work on It. It is generally understood in
police circles that they have found a clew,
and it is hinted that before many hours
have passed some sensational accusations
will be made. In the meantime the offi
cers refuse to tell what progress they are
making in tneir search for tbe establish
ment where helpless babies were mur
dered by wholesale.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 6, 1896.
HARRISON SPEAKS
AT OLD RICHMOND
Five Thousand Virginians
Hear the Distinguished
Ex-President .
Federal Intervention to Suppress
Riots and Enforce Law
Justfied.
CAMPAIGN ISSUES REVIEWED.
Reasons Why the Voters Should Join
in Upholding the Integrity of
the Nation.^
RICHMOND, Va., Oct. s.â Ex- President
Benjamin Harrison addressed about 5000
people here to-night at the Auditorium
building. Of the number named about
half were colored people. The distin
guished speaker was met at Hanover
Junction by a committee of well-known
Republicans, and on his arrival here was
driven to the Jefferson Hotel.
After dinnar he was driven to the
Auditorium. General Harrison was
cordially received by the crowd. Judge
Lewis, who presided over the meeting,
presented the speaker of the occasion.
There were in the stand a number of lead
ing Republicans and Sound-money Dem
ocrats, and there were many Bryan men
in the audience.
About 9 o'clock the electric lights sud
denly went out as they did when Mr. Bryan
spoke in the same place recently. For
about five minuses the hall was in dark
ness. During this time Mr. Harrison re
marked that our party does not need so
much light as that of our opponents. An
old colored man soon brought in a torch,
which he passed up to the speaker. The
lights were turned on soon afterward.
Mr. Harrison then spoke as follows:
I have upon my return to my home in the
West been requested by some Virginia friends
to speak to you lor a little while upon some of
the great issues that are now agitating in an
extraordinary way all the people of all sec
tionn of this great country. Virginia is not the
enemy's country to me.
It is my ancestral home and its citizens are
my fellow-citizens. There was a time when
the North and South were arrayed against
each other. That time la to us now only a
memory; we are again one united, loyal
people. If it should ever be the sad fate of this
country to be again Involved in war; if
any foreign power trample upon that
flag or invades our shores, Ineiana and Vir
ginia will charge together against the enemy,
and then what shall stay that onslaught? The
memory of Gettysburg and Appomattox will
make it impossible for a regiment of English
to get on this side of the breastworks.
The speaker then said that they were
citizens of a Union established by our fore
fathers and would claim those rights
which were left to the States when the
Federal constitution was organized. The
wisdom of our forefathers devised a sys
tem by wnich they committed to the Na
tional Government all National concerns
and reserved to the State Governments all
local concerns. Continuing he said:
I regret to notice that in this campaign an
issue is made on what I believe to be the just
powers of the National Government The in
cident *>ut of which this grows is what has
come to be well known as the great Chicago
riot. There, in defiance of law, both State and
National, great organized bodies, or acting in
dividually upon a mad impulse, went through
the streets of Chicago with fire and sword, de-
Btroying property, interrupting all railroad
communication and stopping tne passage of
the United States mail.
This hal its origin in a railroad strike, but I
believe these acts of violence were largely the
acts of irresponsible and desperate men, who
marched under the red flag of anarchy. Tne
President, Mr. Cleveland, a Democrat, felt it
to be his duty under the constitution to use
the forces of the United States to open a way
lor the public mails and for interstate com
merce.
It was as plainly his duty to doso as any
duty that ever devolved upon a public of
ficial. Does Virginia consent, does she mean
to express her consent this fall thai tne mails
may be stopped by a mob in any city of our
States and their delivery interrupted? Does
Virginia mean to say this fall at tbe election
that she is content that the products of her
State on the way to another State may be
stopped by an irresponsible mob In any city
in tbe land?
The President of the United States is sworn
to execute tbe laws and Is made commander
in-chief of the army and navy of the United
States, that he may have suitable instruments
to execute them. Without unnecessary vio
lence, with a restraint that was remarkable,
the troops of tne United States were simply
used to push out of the way of those rioters
who obstructed tha progress of the mails and
of interstate commerce.
The courts of the United States were ap
pealed to. That right is familiar to every
lawyer and every intelligent, citizen, the right
of injunction by which the courts restrain
lawless conspiracies to oppose the law, and it
was used by the Circuit Courts of the United
States.
It is essential to the life of the judiciary that
it should have power to punish those who in
sult or disobey it. These couru proceeded
with the most strict conformity to law. They
proceeded upon lines familiar to the profes
sion and yet the President who executed the
law by using the forces of the United States,
and the courts that used their powers to an
ticipate and prevent violation of the law, are
both denounced in the Chicago platform.
Continuing, the speaker said that our
communities everywhere rested upon the
law and its enforcement for their secur
ity, and that of all sections the South
should be more jealous to see that the
power of the law was preserved, and Vir
ginia especially, tbe State that gave to
the "United States the great Chief Justice
Marshall.
The speaker then declared that Senator
Daniel had introduced and passed a reso
lution in the Senate indorsing the action
of President Cleveiand, and yet he had
presided over the convention which de
nounced that very act. Continuing on
this subject Mr. Harrison said:
Have we ever heard anything from the can
didate of the Chicago convention? Has he
ever said in any speech he has made that if he
should be chosen President that he would exe
cute the law as Mr. Cleveland executed it*
has not said it, but he has accepted every word
of the Chicago convention, and there
fore is pledged that if he Is elected
President, and that in New York, Chicago
cr in any other great center of population a
mob should lift the red flag of anarchy and
stay the progress of your mails, he would not
Interfere until the Governor of the State asked
him to. Whatever may have been your party
affiliations, are you prepared for that?
The remaiuder or Mr. Harrison's speech
was devoted to the discussion of the finan
cial question in its various phases.
Mr. Harrison left the city to-night on
the private car of Mr. In calls, president of
the Chesapeake and Ohio road.
INFLUENCED AT FUSION.
Major William Walton Withdraws From
the Populist Ticket.
AUSTIN, Tex., Oct. s.â Major William
Walton, candidate for State Attorney on
the Populist ticket, withdrew to-day. In
his card he says the Chicago platform in
its financial and other important planks is
purely Populist and he urges all Populists
to stand by it and prevent the electoral
vote of Texas going to McKinley. Ihe
free-silver Democrats are jubilant, but
Marion Williams, editor of a Populist
paper, and other leaders in the Populist
party say Walton's withdrawal will i:s no
way affect the campaign. Dr. E. P.
Wilmot, chairman of the Republican
executive committee of this district, said
he thought it would have no influence one
way or the other. It is reported that there
is a possibility of Judge Rufus Hardy,
chairman of the sound-money Democratic
committee, taking Walton's place.
DALLAS, Tex., Oct. s.â The announce
ment that Hon. M. W. Walton of Austin,
Populist nominee for Attorney-General,
had withdrawn from the Populist ticket,
created general surprise among the Popu
list leaders of this city. It is believed that
the Republican-Populist fusion scheme
has influenced him in his course.
WHAT DAVE HILL WILL DO.
Danforth Thinks //Â«â¢ Will Support the
liryaii Ticket.
UTICA, N. V., Oct. s.â Hon. Elliott
Danforth, chairman of the Democratic
State Committee, was here to-day, where
he had some business before the Surrogate
Circuit Court. A rsporter asked him con
cerning his visit to Senator Hill at Albany
and as to what stand Senator Hill would
take in this campaign. He received the
following reply: "I beiieve Senator Hill will
support the Democratic ticket and is anx
ious for its success. At the proper time
and in his own way I believe that he will
so declare."
Chairman Danforth appearea in tne
best of spirits and those who talked with
him were of the impression that he re
ceived assurances from Hill in Albany
that gave him considerable confidence in
the Campaign.
Formal Protests Filed.
LINCOLN. Nebr., Oct. s.â Formal pro
tests were to-day tiled with the Secretary
of State by attorneys representing the
State Central Committee. The petition
objects to the nominees of the administra
tion wing of the Democratic party appear
ing on the official ballot as Democrats.
The protest sets forth that this element
does not stand for the principles incorpor
ated in tho platform of the National plat
form, and therefore can only appear as by
petition.
FRAUD IS NOW ALLEGED,
Stockholders Ask a Receiver lor
the Harrison Telephone
Company.
Millions of Dollars Said to Have Been

CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 5.â A bill for a re
ceiver was filed t*-day in the United States
Court here by S. A. Williams and D. J.
Young of Smith, Ark., two stockholders,
praying that some one be appointed to
take charge of the affairs of the Harrison
international Telephone Company. An
order was made restraining P. E. Ingalls
from disposing of any property, and the
motion for the appointment of a receiver
will be heard at a later date. The bill as
serts that the franchises and patents of
the International Telephone Company
have been given to the International Tele
pbooe Construction Company, of which
President Ingalls is the practical owner.
The bill charges that the telephone
company was organized by Inventor Har
rison with a capital of $80,000,000, reserv
ing to himself $50,000,000. It is abo al
leged that later $2,000,000 was donated to
United States Senator Stephen B. Elkins
and ex-Secretary of the Treasury Charles
Foster, R. E. Kerns, G. R. Peck, Congress
man William Warner and others.
It is charged also that the proceeds of
the stock which was really sold was
thrown away in exorbitant commission
and foreclosure of franchises. It is
claimed that fraud was used in tbe trans
fer of the property of the telephone com
pany to the construction company, as the
minutes of the telephone company were
changed without authority to make such
action seem regular. Therefore owners of
tbe stock of the telephone company find
themselves with nothing but worthless
paper representing their holdings in the
telephone company.
The complainants assert that President
Ingalls has fraudulently obtained posses
sion of all interests, and a receiver is
prayed for to take charge of the property
of both the companies and that the court
set aside the alleged fraudulent transfers
and that the receiver be authorized to
wind up the affairs of both companies,
which are said to be insolvent.
ATTEMPT TO BURN A MINE.
Peculiar Incendiary Work at the Seneca
That Cannot Be Attributed to
Union Men.
LEADVILLE, Colo., Oct. s.â lt trans
pires to-night that an attempt was made
last night to burn the Sentca mine. It
was learned to-day that some one cut the
cable and sent tbe bucket crashing to the
bottom of the shaft, but as the Seneca is
employing union men at union wages it
was the supposition at first that a lot of
boys did the job.
Investigation, however, shows that men
did the woik. They ruined some of the
machinery and sent the bucket down the
shaft, breaking some timbers. Then they
saturated a lot of paper and rags with oil,
and tried to set the shaft-house on fire,
but tbe dames went out.
Tbe Seneca is located on Carbonate Hill
and is a big lead producer. The damage
sustained amounts to only $600. As the
Seneca is not breaking any of the laws of
the union the destruction of its property
is unaccounted for, unless done as spite
work. The Seneca is under lease to Dan
McNivin.
William Venable, a member of Com
pany X, C. N. G.,of this city, was accident
ally snot in the left arm while at target
practice this morning and it was found
necessary to amputate the injured mem
ber this evening.
Imports of Gold.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. s.â The steam
ship La Bourgogne, which arrived yester
day, brought $600,000 gold consigned to
Lazard Freres. It was announced from
Boston that Kidder, Peabody & Co. have
received $950,000 gold by the steamer Ser
v:h- Total imports thus far have been
$44,319,590.
Valuable Ore Stolen.
VICTOR. Cole, Oct. s.â On Sunday
night the orehouse of the May Bell mine
was robbed of sixty-five sacks of ore
which is estimated to run $65,000 to the
ton. The ore was awaiting shipment and
was thought to be securely locked.
McKINLEY GREETED
BY YOUNG VOTERS
With Bands and Torches
They Call on the Repub
lican Candidate.
Some Good Advice That All
Americans Would Do Well
to Follow.
MANY DELEGATIONS ARE GOING
Canton Continues to Bj the Mecca for
Those Who Favor Protection
and Prosperity.
CANTON, Ohio, Oct. s.â Major McKin
ley had an unexpected call this evening
from several hundred of the first voters of
Canton. They came with torches and
bands at half-past 8 o'clock. T. F. Tur
ner made some pleasant remarks for the
first voters, to which Major McKinley re
sponded as follows:
I am glad, young men of Canton, to meet
you at my home to-night, and I congratulate
you upon having enrolled yourselves on the
side of the Republican party. JN'o party ever
had a grander history ; no party ever did more
for American kind, for liberty, for equality
and for the pTogress and glory of the country
than the party in whose cause you have en
listed. No party appeals more to the intelli
gence and pride and the patriotism of young
men than ours. I appreciate this calL The
young men are always au inspiration to me.
They represent the community, the State and
the Nation. [Applause.] In a little while
will fall upon them the duties and responsi
bilities which are now borne by those who are
older. 1 love to have the young men about
me; and I can do no better than to say to you
to-dayâ those of you who have your careers
ye to make and your fortunes yet to build,
and your places to findâ l can do no better
than to say to you that there is nothing in
this world that will serve you so well as good
character, clean in morals and in life.
I do not care what you may conclude to do â
whether you engage in business or a pro
fession; what you may choose as your occupa
tionâthere is nothing that will count so
much, or mean so much, or wear so well, as
good habits and a spotless name. [Applause.]
You have done well iv this first voting to en
list under the banner of the Republican party,
which, In my judgment, represents the best
hopes and aspirations of the American people,
and embraces within its doctrines and pur
poses the honor of the country and the great
est prosperity of all the people. [Great ap
plause.]
Major McKinley had a qniet time to
day, so far as the calls of visitors and dele
gates were concerned. The one delega
tion scheduled for to-day failed to come,
and there were few callers. Major Mc-
Kinley was grateful for the respite, for it
gave him an opportunity for uninter
rupted work on tbe speeches which ho is
to make Tuesday and later in the week. .
Four delegations are expected to-mor
row â one from Syracuse, one from Buf
falo, one from Michigan and one from In
diana.
Judge A. W. Tenny of Brooklyn was
one of Major McKinley's callers to-day.
He has bee.i making speeches in Virginia
and West Virginia and firmly believeu the
Republicans will carry both States. He is
confident that the plurality for the Re
publican ticket in West Virginia will ex
ceed 10,000. He is of the opinion that a
large number of Democrats of Virginia
will support Palmer and Buckner and tne
vote of the State be so split that the Re
publicans can elect their electoral ticket.
A dispatch from Virginia to-night says
that the excursion of ex-Confederates
from the Shenandoah Valley will arrive
in Canton Friday morning at 8:30. The
delegation of ex-Confederates will come
on four special trains of ten coaches each.
Major McKinley recei^d by express to
day a fine live eagle from State Senator
E. S. Denison of California. The letter
which came with the eagle said: "I send
you a live American eagle captured in the
hills of Berkeley as a worthy and em
blematic mascot in this patriotic cam
paign for protection and sound money.
He bears encouraging news from Califor
nia, and fairly illustrates the watchful
eye, strength of purpose and unconquer
able will and spirit that animates the Re
publican party j.i this distant State."
ENTHUSIASM AT ST. JOSEPH.
Veteran Republican Orators Given a

ST. JOSEPH, Mo., Oct s.â The party
composed of Generals O. O. Howard, Rus
sell A. Alger, Daniel E. Sickels, Thomas
J. Stewart, George A. Marsden, Corporal
Tanner, Major J. W. Burst, Colonel
George H. Hopkins and oiher distin
guished sound money, orators reached
here to-night by special train and were
met at the station by all of tbe Republi
can clubs of the city ana 5000 spectators
were formed in a procession and, headed
by the veteran McKinley Club and the
Blame Flambeau Club, marched through
the streets of the city. It is estimated
that 7500 people were in line and enthusi
asm ran hieh.
The visitors were escorted to the opera
house, where they spoke on the political
questions of the day. The halls were
insufficient to take care of one-tenth of
the crowd and overflowing meetings were
held, people standing in the rain to hear
tbe orators. The pars^ was most cor
dially treated here and left by special at 11
p. m. for Ottumwa, lowa.
GAIN FIFTEEN TOWNS.
Republican* Secure Victoria* in the Con-
necticut Election.
HARTFORD, Conn., Oct. 5. â Town
elections were held in all the 169 towns in
the State, wit the exception of Hartford,
New Haven, Bridgeport, Ansonia, Derby
and Nauagutuck. Returns show that the
Republicans have made large gains over a
year ago, having nearly doubled their
number of towns from 1893. In Hartford
County in 1895 the towns stood: Republi
can 17, Democratic 14, divided 7. Returns
show that the Republicans have gained
three towns and the Democrats have lost
one, five being divided. Middlesex
County, complete, shows twelve Republi
can towns. In two towns "National
Democratic" tickets were voted for. It is
probable tbat the complete returns will
show that the Republicans have gained
at least fifteen towns.
CAMPAIGN LINE ARE SAILED.
Hobart Not JntereiÂ»ted in Coal Trusts,
.hi'/ Hanna In Hopeful.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. s.â Wheu Vice-
Presidential Candidate Hobart's attention
was called to-day to a dispatch that has
been recently circulated in the West that
he is president of the coal trust, which, it
is alleged, has advanced the price of coal,
Mr. Hobart said: "Last December the
trunk line railroads east of the Mississippi
were called upon, under an agreement
known as the Joint Traffic Association, to
select three arbitrators to arbitrate the dif
ferences which might arise between the
railroads. Only trunk lines were included
in this arbitration. The coal roads were
not included, and the matters submitted
to arbitration had nothing to do with the
coal production, coal tonnage or the price
of coal in any /nanner, form or shape
whatever, either directly or indirectly."
Mr. Hobart also said he has no connec
tion with any such coal trust and does
not know of the existence of any such
trust, except as he has seen statements in
the newspapers.
Mr. Hanna, when asked this afternoon
wnat truth there was in the report that
he had written a letter to an intimate
friend in which he "conceded the election
of Bryan because Republicans were unable
to control the labor vote," said that the
report was absurd on the face of it. "I
have not written such a letter," he said,
"nor have I at any time said anything
capable of such construction. I have
never conceded the election of Mr. Bryan,
and I certainly cannot concede it now
when the tide is flowing so strongly and
unmistakably in the direction of Republi
can success."
CANNOT ELECT BRIAN.
Republican Manager* Issue a Statement
Which Democrats Deny.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 5.â A bulletin
issued by the Republican National man
agers declares that from now on the
Democratic National Committee will in
effect abandon the attempt to elect Bryan
and "devote the rest of the campaign to
the election of Legislatures in States
where United States Senators are to be
chosen. Their plan is to try to retain
the free silver control in the Senate by
electing enough silver Senators to hold
the balance of power and prevent the
passage of a tariff bill unless a bill is also
passed for at least the free coinage of the
product of American silver mines."
The bulletin declares further that "the
Republican committee is fully aware of
the plans of the Democratic committee in
regard to the legislative fights in certain
quarters and is alreaqy prepared to defeat
them in this regard, as has been done in
the campaign to elect Mr. Bryan."
Abner McKinley, brother of the Repub
lican Presidential candidate, spent the
day in Chicago. General Grosvenor of
Ohio arrived in the city to-day and to
night spoke at a big tent-meeting on the
south side. General Grosvenor is just
back from lowa and is so confident of
success in that State that he offered to
wager $1000 to $100 with a gentleman from
Democratic headquarters, who, however,
declined to accept the offer.
Regarding the report given out from
Republican headquarters that the Demo
crats had abandoned the attempt to elect
Bryan, and were only striving to control
State Legislatures in order to secure the re
turn of silver.Senators, Chairman Jones of
the Democratic National Committee said:
"There is not a syllable of trutb in the
assertion that we have abandoned Bryan
or that we intend doing so. Mr. Bryan is
already elected ; from now on it is only a
question of majority. We not only intend
to elect Mr. Bryan, but we are sure to
carry enough Legislatures to increase the
free silver majority in the United States
Senate. In this connection I desire to
warn the public against any statements
appearing from this time from the gold
bug press concerning this campaign."
TACTICS OF SILVARITEN.
An Attempt to Shut Out McKinley and
Hobart Electors in Colorado.
DENVER, Colo., Oct. s.â Cuaiiman
Broad of the Silver Republican party to
day filed with the Secretary of State a
protest against granting the Eagle emblem
to the McKinley organization or recogniz
ing that political ticket as the Republican
party nominees. The purpose of tnisis to
prevent the McKinley-Hobart electors
from appearing on the official ballots in
this State. Under the law any political
party may apply for admission upon the
official ballot by petition, but the time for
1 such action expired last night, and should
the protest of Broad be sustained tbe
McKinley ticket cannot appear on the
ballots. The fi.'ht will be based upon a
construction of the courts upon the action
of the Republican State Committee last
August, when the split occurred.
We can make the prices ! We are wholesale manufac-
turers â we make the cloth and we make the clothing.

WHY MR, BRYAN
MUST BE BEATEN
Ringing Addresses Issued
by German- American
Republicans.
Certain Elements Are Bent on
Undermining the Nation's
Credit and Honor.
GREED OF SILVER PRODUCERS.
Citizens Who LovÂ« Their Country
Called Upon to Vote for Me*
Kinley and Hobart.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. s.â The advi
sory committee of the German- Americans
attached to the Republican National Com
mittee issued an address this afternoon.
The address is as follows:
"When our country was in danger of
being torn asunder by secession a large
majority of the citizens, and particularly
the German- Americans, stood ready at the
initant to sacrifice their lives and all they
had for the maintenance of the Union.
"To-day certain elements are bent on
undermining the honor and credit of our
country and in destroying its property;
they are aiming to depreciate our stand
ard money, guaranteed by our constitu
tion. To overcome this danger and to
remove this disgrace now threatening our
country all patriotic citizens are again
binding themselves together. This dan
ger has been caused by the selfishness of
owners of silver mines, who are aiming to
find a more extended market for their
vastly increased production and to secure
for themselves unusual profits.
"The distressed condition of buaineis
affairs during the past years, which was
partly brought about by a change in the
tariff, furnished them with a welcome
opportunity for influencing public opinion
by continued agitation. To champion
their cause they succeeded in getting a
number of demagogues who, with the aid
of the Populistic and socialistic strikers,
made themselves masters of the conven
tion and one of the two great political
parties.
"Through its standard-bearers the party
now appeals to thousands who are dis
satisfied with tne present condition of
life and the opportunities for matins a
living. It calls upon those who possess
nothing to engage in conflict with those
who own property. It keeps up an agita
tion in favor of changing the present
standard into free and unlimited coinage
of silver in order to surrender the govern
ment of the country into the bands of
such an element as threaten to subvert
the very foundations on wnich rest all
the interests of the wage-earners and of
commerce and agriculture. Furthermore,
it threatens, aided by Populistic-anarchis
tic elements, the very foundation of our
constitution, public order and the exist
ence of our Supreme Court.
"No American citizen who loves his
country can remain indifferent aud in
active in this campaign, for aside from all
ethical considerations there is at stake
the interests of the entire country. In
view of the importance of these questions
and also of the conceded general intelli
gence of the German-American citizens of
this country, we believe that, as at the
time when our Union was in danger, so
they will now rush to the rescue of our
Nation's honor and do all in their power
to put an end with one decisive blow to
all 'the dangers now threatening our coun
try. This can be done by voting for tho
standard-bearers of that party which just
came out for the gold standard. By elect
ing McKinley and Hobart the honor of
our Nation and the credit of our country
will be maintained and all our National
institutions permanently secured. By
electing these candidates we will not only
show to our country but to all the world
that we are an honest people and propose
to remain so."

AN ENTENTE WITH
RUSSIA'S RULER
It May Soon Lead to the
Deposition of Turkey's
Sultan.
Lord Salisbury and the Czar
Reached an Agreement
at Balmoral.
SIX WILLIAM'S FIRM VIEWS.
Harcourt Rejoiced at the Anti-Sultan
Outburst Throughout Great
Britain.
LONDON, Eva., Oct. s.â ln its issue
to-morrow : the v- Chronicle will claim to
have high authority for the . statement,
although the paper does not vouch for its
correctness, that Lord Salisbury, during
bis recent visit to Balmoral, arrived at
an entente with the Czar that will
lead to the deposition- of the Sul
tan of Turkey. I-ord Salisbury
the statement adds, found the Czar highly
sympathetic, but ha feared that decisive
action wonld provoke a massacre of the
Christians in Constantinople. Lord Salis
bury removed the Czar's fears and his
Majesty now concurs in the desire to in
tervene. The deposition ,of the Sultan
would not be necessary immediately, but
it would be the linal outcome of the diplo
matic preliminaries. ..
Sir William Veruon Harcourt, the leader
of the opposition in the House of Com
mons, to-night attended an anti-Sultan
meeting at; Ebbvale, Monmouthshire. â¢ A
resolution was submitted and adopted
calling upon the Government to do every
thing possible to protect the Armenians.
In supporting, the resolution Sir Wil
liam said be rejoiced at the anti-Sultan
outburst in England. Experience, he
added, had proved that the policy of Great
Britain in defending the integrity of
Turkey and preventing the interven
tion of Russia had % failed. Great
Britain ought in the future to co-operate
with Russia in the East, treating her as an
Asiatic neighbor. The first step in this
direction ought to be a formal renuncia
tion of the Cyprus convention, by which
in return for support of the Turks the
latter ceded the Island of Cyprus to Eng
land.
Sir William declared that he was pro
foundly convinced that it was utterly im
possible for Great Britain to effectually
operate alone against Turkey, He did
not admire Great Britain's splendid isola
tion, which resulted in humiliating im
potence. He preferred to cultivate the
friendship of other powers.
Sir William concluded by saying that he
did not want Great Britain to enter into
formal treaties of alliance with the other
great powers, but did desire that she have
an entente cordiale with all of them.

THREE GAMES STRAIGHT.
Jialtimore Having So Trouble in Cap
turing the Temple Cup.
BALTIMORE, Md., Oct. s.â The chances
for the Temple cup resting in Baltimore
this winter are very bright. To-day the
third game of the series with the Cleve
land team, the last one to be played in
Baltimore, went to the home team by the
score of 6to 2. The champions need but
one more game to capture the flagon.
Unless Clevelands put up better ball on
their home grounds than they have played
here the.Baltimores are likely to make it
four straight. The Eastern boys are at
their best and the series has beea ably
played.
Young and Cuppy have both been out
of condition. The teams will continue the
series in Cleveland on Wednesday, Friday
and Saturday, provided the BalUmores do
not win and thus end the contest. Should
a seventh game be necessary, it will most
likely be played in Pittsburg. Captain
Tebeau has not recovered from the wrench
he gave his back during Friday's game,
but he is improving and was on the bench
to-day. The prices of admission to-day
were reduced to the figures obtained dur
ing the cham*pionship season, and 4134
persons paid entrance fees.
This afternoon's contest was remarkable
for the number pi brilliant catches in the
outfield and the small number of errors.
There were but two Baltimore men leU on
bases. Score: Baltimores, 6, 8, 2; Cleve
lands, 2, Id, 2. Batteriesâ Hofler and Rob

Spirited Mace* at the "Bind Up of the
national Circuit.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Oct. 5,-The
National circuit bicycle meet at Inter
national Athletic Park to-day was the
final wind up of the National circuit lor
the season. The track, which is one-third
of a mile, was in perfect condition. The
weather was cloudy and attendance large.
Additional interest was lent by the fact
that to-day's events will probably deter
mine the standing for the season of 1890
of the three leading professionalsâ Bald,
Cooper and Gardnerâ it being possible for
either of the trio to win the coveted
honor.
Bald captured the first plsces, and on
third scoring 7 points and winning the
championship with a score of GG points.
Cooper came in first in one race and second
in another, making his total 65, while
Gardiner scored twice, bringing his total
up to til. This rivalry had much to do
with the last riding and exciting finishes
in the professional eventsâ the last, a
two-mile handicap, with handicaps rang
ing up to 275 yards, being marked by a
very close finish* between the scratch men
and was won almost at the tape by Cooper.
One mile, novice, won by H. W. Haendster.
Time, 2:414-5. .
One mile, open, professional, final neat won
by Bald. Gardiuer second, Cooper third. Time,

PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL.
Various Wrangle* Before the Xational
Hoard of Association*.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. s.â The meet
ing of the National Board of Professional
Baseball Associations, which commenced
this morning, was adjourned at 7:45
o'clock this evening until noon to-mor
row. The board, which consists of N. E.
Young (chairman), J. T. Brash of Cincin
nati, A. H. Soden of Boston and C. H.
Byrne of Brooklyn, spent almost the
whole day considering grievances of the
Western League.
President Young said that no decision
had been arrived at, as the time of the
board had been taiten up with the hearing
of evidence and discussions. President
*'Ban" Johnson of the Western League
and J. T. Killilea, owner of the Milwaukee
Club, were before the board. Colonel
Rogers of Philadelphia was also a witness.
The members of the board would give no
particulars, but it was understood that an
effort was being made to force the West
ern League to resign from the protection
of the National League at the instigation
of the Minneapolis and Indianapolis
clubs, the latter of which is owned by J.
T. Brush. President Young also said that
the matter is one which required consid
eration as to how far the power of the
National board extended, and what were
its rights in the matter. A decision will
probably be arrived at to-morrow and
other minor league matters will be
taken up.

SACRAMENTO, Cal., Oct. s.â Never in
the history of any local campaign has
there been such a thorough and complete
organization perfected in the ranks of the
Republican party as at the present time
within the limits of Sacramento County

established with so iittle noise that not
half of the outside world knows of its ex

Over in the shops of the railroad com
pany the brawny sons of toil have formed
a series of clubs and are devoting them
selves during their spare hours to drilling.
During the coming month none who will
march in the various parades will do more
honor to the party than these workmen.
They have decided after mature delibera
tion that the tariff is the issue and that the
monetary question is of minor importance
to men who work for their daily bread.

up the game preserves to the i public. - :
"; Judge i Buckles * said that, while his de
cision regarding the opening of theSolano
marshes to all hunters had been reversed,
it.w as the first time, and he believed the
people of the county would uphold him in
it, although he bowed to the law of his
superiors.
Mr. Me'Kinlay spoke on the present
issues from the standpoint of a mechanic,
and plainly showed to the mechanics and
laborers, of which his audience was prin

sound money paved the highway to pros

FAVORS AS HONEST DOLLAR.
The Santa, Clara County Sound-Money
League Organised.
SAN JOSE, Cal.. Oct. s.â The Sound
money League of Santa Clara County,
auxiliary to the California Sound-money
League, effected a permanent organization
to-night and adopted a constitution and
by-laws. An executive committee of eleven
to begin and carry out the active work of
the campaign of sound-money education
in Santa Clara County, will be appointed
by Chairman "VV. E. Crossman next
Wednesday.
The executive committee appointed will
meet immediately for organization. It
will determine that, although the cam
paign must necessarily be a short one, it
would be just as effective by being warm
and aggressive. Every one who can possi
bly be reached by literature and other
wise will be shown the fallacy of the free
silver doctrine.
There were a number of signatures to
the roll of membership, including many
old-time Democrats who favor a sound
financial policy in the Nation. Efforts
will be made to have Bourke Cock ran and
Thomas B. Reed come to San Jose if they
are brought to this State under the au
spices of the California Sound Money
League.
STANISLAUN COUNTY MUDDLE.
Democrat* Xeglect to File Certificate* of
Sofnination*.
MODESTO, Cal., Oct. s.â Local Demo
crats were nonplused to-day when a ru
mor that necessary certificates of nomina
tiou had not been filed with the county
clerk was found to be true. Invest igation
showed that the legal time lor filing cer
tificates of nomination of the regular
parties expired on Saturday and the Dem
ocratic county central committee failed to
file them, thus leaving the nominees
for Superior Judge, William O. Minor, and
Supervisors, W. M. Muncy, Alfred Davis
and J. P. Barnes, without place on the
ticket. To-morrow the committee will at
tempt to file certificates and if necessary
mandamus the County Clerk to file them.
Then thÂ«y will carry the case to the Su
preme Court as a test case. Petitions may
have to be circulated to get signatures of
3 per cent of the voters of the county, ask
ing that the names be put on the ticket,
but this will place the Democrat candi
dates on an independent ticket.

AT SAN JOSE
Awarded the Target Asso
ciation Championship
Trophy,
Los Angeles Marksmen Beaten
in the Contest Because
of a Balk.
JOLCHER CUP GOES TO NORTON.
Haas cf Stockton First in the In*
dividual Match-Close of the
Tournament.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Oct. s.â The San Jose
meet of the California Inanimate Target
Association closed this afternoon after
two days of excitmg individual and team
contests. The crowd of spectators upon
the shooting grounds was not as large as
that of Sunday, but the interest in the
contests was much greater.
The team shoot for the Association
championship medal was the principal
event of the day, and the result of this
contest aroused much feeling among the
marksmen. In the regular team shoot
the Olympic Gun Club of San Francisco
scored 99 bird* out of a possible 110. This
score was not equaled until the Los
Angeles Gun CluD came before the traps.
This club from the start did some fine
steady shooting, and it was predicted be
fore more than one-half of the 120 birds
had been fired at that it would equal the
Olympic score.
When Leighton leveled his gun at his
thirteenth bird, another biid from an ad
joining trap crossed his target. This
happened as he was about to pull his trig
ger, and owing to momentary confusion
he shot wild. He claimed a balk and the
judges allowed it and gave him another
bird, which he broke.
No protest was entered against this
until after all the shots had been fired,
when it was found that the Los Angeles
team had broken 100 bluerocks and se
cured the highest score. The members of
the Olympic team then entered a protest
and asked an opinion from the tourna
ment committee.
This committee decided that the balk
should not have been allowed and de
clared the Los Angeles team score to be
99, or a tie with the Olympic Club.
Against this decision the Los Angeles
men rebelled, claiming that the decision
of the judges was final unless the
Olympic team had protested against
allowing the balk at the time It
was claimed to have been made and then
taken an appeal to the committee if the
decision was objected to. The Los An
geles team positively refused to accept the
score as a tie and to accede to the order
to shoot again for the association cham
pionship trophy, which was accordingly
awarded to the Olympic team.
The latter team went before the traps
and shot at twenty birds each, registering
a score of 106, or the highest of the day.
The Los Angeles team was awarded the
second money prize.
The contest for the Golcber cup nar
rowed down to eight men, who tied each
other with a score of 19 each in the sec
ond event. Those contesting in the shoot
off were F. A. Norton, C. Haas, Swain,
Nanman, F. Vernon, Balkwill, Ditz,
Chappell and Pedler. Norton made 20
straight breaks and won the trophy.
The contest for the association indi
vidual championship medal in the third
event resulted in a tie between G. W.
Hinkle of Visalia and C. J. Haas of the
Stockton Athletic Association, who made
clean scores of 20 each. In the shoot-off
Haas broke 19 birds and Hinkle 17. Haas
was awarded the medal.
The following made clean scores in the
20-bird events: C. Merrill, C. J. Haas (2),
Andrus, G. W. Hinkle, G. Ditz, &. Coy-
Kendall, P. B. Norton.
In the 1 Vbird contests clean scores were
made by G. Hinkle, C. C. Nauman, C. A.
Haight, Dr. W. S. George, W. H. Varien,
C. Carr, J. Ross, C. Leighton, J. Jeffrey

At the Vendome Hotel this evening the

were beautifully decorated and lighted
with candles placed in cartridge-shells set
in bluerock holders. The menu for the
banquet contained many courses of the
season's delicacies, worded in strictly gun
language.
FLAMES NEARING SWITZERS.
Entire Timber Area of Southern California
Threatened by the Sierra Madre
Conflagration.
PASADENA, Cal., Oct. s.â To-nigtit
great tongues of flame are to be seen on
the top of the front range of the Sierra
Madre, on which the Mount Lowe Railway
and the Echo Mountain Hotel are located,
and all day huge volumes of smoke have
roiled up to the north ol Pasadena. E.
H. Royce has just returned from the camp
of fire-fighters and reports the main point
of attack is near Strawberry Peak, north
of the east forK of the Arroyo and two
miles from Switzers. Between there and
the huge fire in Tejunga, a distance of
eight miles, practically the whole country
is in ashes, so no danger to the front
range is likely from the Tejunga fire.
The San Gabriel Canyon fire is now with
in six miles of Switzers, and is working
northwest at a rapid rate. Should it meet
and join with the Tejunga fire nothing j
could stop the destruction of practically
the whole timber area of Southern Cali
fornia, Mr. Royce says, and the fire-fight
ers agree with him. Nothing is being
done to check the San Gabriel Canyon|fire
at present.
John McCutoheon, who came in this
afternoon, says the flames are fifty feet
high on the mountainsides.
Mongols Sail From Taeoma.
TACOMA, Wash., Oct. s.â Between 150
and 200 Chinese have arrived here from
San Francisco during the past week to
take passage on the Northern Pa
cific steamer Breamar, which sails
on Wednesday for Hong Konp.
The emigrants include many mer
chants who are going over to remain
during the holidays; others go to purchase
poods for holiday trade in this country.
They secure passage from Tacoma for
$37 50, as against $51 from San Francisco,
which explains why they come north 800
miles to take steamers instead of patroniz
ing San Francisco lines.
Suicide at San Diego.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Oct. s.â John Hayes,
a native of Finland, 50 years old, com
mitted suicide this afternoon by shooting
himself in the head. He came to San
Diego a few weeks ago from San Fran
cisco, where he was a member of the Sea
men's Union.

FROM MT. LOWE
The Astronomical Wizard
Soon to Leave for
the East.
Will Take With Him the Great
Telescope and All of the
Paraphernalia.
HE QV9ISS THE AFPABATTJS.
The Famed Observatory oa the South
ern Peak to Be Stripped of
Its Trappings.
ECHO MOUNTAIN, Cal., Oct. s.âPro
fessor Lewis Swift, the astronomical wiz
ard of Mount Lowe, leaves for the East in
a few days and it is quite probable that he
will not return to the observatory which
clings like a swallow's nest to the heights
of Echo Mountain. There, for two and a
â¢ half years, the professor has watched the
stars and discovered comets from the mass
of uebuise in the heavens. Since the
.Mount Lowe property has gone into the
hands of receivers, affairs at the observa
tory, financially considered, have come to
a standstill, and Professor Swift intends to
remove the big telescope and all the as
tronomical paraphernalia, which is valued
at thousands of dollars, to some point
where astronomical research is rated at a
â¦higher value in dollars and cents. All the
. apparatus belongs to him, the bare ob
â¢ strvatory only being the property of the
ilount Lowe Company.
Since Professor Swift came to Echo
Mountain he has discovered four comets,
the last about a week ago, a double comet.
"How many comets have I ever dis
covered?" said the professor to-day in
answer to a query from The Call corre
spondent. "Well, I bave discovered six
teen and lost half as muny. You see
sometimes I discover a comet which is so
dim I can scarcely distinguish it from
nebula and whan I look for it again it is
gone. Five of my comets are periodic 3,
with tbe following periods: five andahalf
years; seven and a half ; seven years, 186
days; 121 years and 28,000 years."

ers to Ply Between Puget Sound
and South America.
TACOMA, Wash., Oct. s.â The growing
trade between Paget Sound and Central
America has caused the establishment of
a second line of steamers between this
city and the southern continent. The
first line was started a year ago when the
steamer Transit was put on by a local com
pany. It has been doing good business
both ways and was recently rechartered
for another year.
Now comes the announcement that the
British steamer Amarapoora is en route
from Hongkong to load a general cargo
for La Libertad and other Central Ameri
can ports, sailing October 25. Saunders,

Oklahoma Jail.
SOUTH END, O. T., Oct. s.â Frank
Royce, convicted of embezzlement, sawed
through the bars of the cage of the jail
last night while the jailer was at supper
and escaped. No trace of him has yet
been found. Royce once practiced law at
Atchison, Kans., but at the opening of the
Cherokee strip he went to Pond Creek,
and then came here and became cashier of
the County bank. The bank failed in
July, 1894, and Royce was Indicted for
embezzlement. While he was out on bail
he became president of a small private
bank in Jamaica, lowa, and from there is
sued bogus drafts upon various banks in
Chicago and elsewhere. These were nego
tiated by George Elwood, Frank Olive and
James Logan, all of Grant County, and
many banks in Colorado, Texas, Kansas
and Indian Territory were defrauded.
About last December the conspiracy was
discovered. Olive and Long are now serv
ing sentences, while Elwood is still at
large.

the Rio Puerco Train
Robbers.
Albuquerque Officials Await the
News of an Expected
Battle.
AVENUES OF ESCAPE GUARDED
The Posse Lies in Ambush on the
Trail Chosen by the Fugi
tive Band.
ALBUQUERQUE, N. Mkx., Oct. 5. -The
posse under the command of the Sheriff
of this county, which took the trail of the
train robbers at Rio Puerco the morning
after the attempted holdup, returned to
day without having come up with the
bandits. In giving an account of the
trip the Sheriff says:
"We followed the trail from the station
about five miles down the Puerco River
and then to a gap in the mountains on the
west side of the river. It then led to a
box canyon, nearly to the head of it, where
we found the remains of a camphre and
half a sheep. The men evidently camped
there the night before. The trail then
led back out of the canyon toward the
southeast. After leaving the canyon we
followed the trail for about forty miles,
without water, until it was almost obliter
ated, when we started to the river for
water, reaching the Rio Grande a few
miles below Sabinal."
Dispatches received this evening from
United States Marsnal Loomis report that
his posse is hot on tJie trail. The day it
left here it reached Magdalena about 10
o'clock, and the same day rode to a ranch
sixty miles southwest on the San Augus
tin plain, where the pursuers camped for
the night. The robbers parsed there going
south the same night, taking fresh horses
from a corral not half a mile distant and
leaving their worn-out animals. They
evidently had confederates in that part of
the country. The posse rode back to Mag
dalena and was taken by special train the
same night to Silver City and thence rode
seventy miles to a ranch at the base of the
Magollon Mountains, at a point where the
robbers will have to pass to get out of the
country.
The messenger who brought this in
formation left camp before daylight this
morning. He brought a dispatch from
Marshal Loomis, saying:
"We are abead of the bandits and are
camped at a point which they will have to
pass in getting south. We nave our own
guards this time and there will be no more
horse-trading."
It is the opinion of the railway officials
that there will be a collision between
Loomis and the robbers to-night.

TOM WATSON ACCEPTS.
Dictates a Tetter 80 Saying to Chairman
Butter.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 6. â An At
lanta (Ga.) special says: Thomas E. Wat
son last night dictated a letter accepting
the Populist nomination for Vice-Presi
dent of the United States. It is addressed
to Chairman Butler, and is a vigorous,
Incisive document. Mr. Watson will re
vise the letter and make it public probably
on Wednesday.
In his letter of acceptance the Populist
leader calls attention to the almost for
gotten fact that during the St. Louis con
vention a caucus of "ruiiidle-of-the-road"
delegates representing twenty -one States
was held. At this caucus the delegates
agreed to nominate Norton of Illinois for
President, and Birkett of Mississippi for
Vice-President.
That ticket would have made Bryan's
defeat absolutely certain, but when Wat
son telegraphed a message saying that he
was willing to accept'second place on the
ticket with Bryan the "middle-of-the
road" men, believing tnat the Democratic
managers would support the arrangement
in good faith, withdrew their opposition
to Bryan.
Mr. Watson's letter is practically de
voted to a demonstration along the line
that the Populist candidate for Vice-
President deserves the support of all who
favor Bryan's election.
SUFFERS ON THE STORM.
Urgent Need to Prevent Many from
Starving in Florida.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Oct. s.â Every
report in reeard to the storm increases the
deatn list and the estimation of the prop
erty lost. The condition of the people in
the storm district is appalling and there
is urgent need of aid to prevent starva
tion.
While the suffering- in Baker County is
gieat from the effects of the storm, the
damage is also very great. It is estimated
that the total loss aggregates $250,000. The
people are in destitute circumstances,
without shelter, without food, and a great
many are without change of clothing.

Union was largely occupied to-day in the
discussion of proposed amendments to the
constitution. The committee on strikes
reported in favor of more conservative
action in inaugurating strikes. The
delegates further placed themselves on
record in the matter of politics by adopt
ing a resolution introduced by Samu-1
Gompers declaring that "the introduction
of party politics of whatsoever kind into
the Cigar-makers : International Union is
contrary to the best interests of our craft,
our organization and our cause, and
should be discountenanced."

A BADLY INJURED WOMAN.
Aa a Result of the Car Accident Mrs.
I). Chisholm Is Cnable to See

Mrs. Donald Chisholm. the old lady

fecting nearly every part of her anatomy.
She was too ill yesterday to be seen by any
one but her husband, who is acting as her
nurse, and her physician. AsidÂ« lrom her
physical injuries, the shock to her system
makes her case more serious.
After the accident the three injured
people remained in W. W. Campbell's
drugstore for an hour anil a half, when a
representative of the road arrived and
offered to compromise the case by paying

NEW PLAYS SEEN
AT THE THEATERS
The Baldwin Season Starts
With "The Prisoner
of Zenda."
Anthony Hope's Novel Proves
a Success in Its Dra
matic Form.
"TRILBY" AND ANEW SVENQALI
"The Great Bonanza" Opens Auspi
ciously at the Grand Opera*
House.
The winter season at the Baldwin
Theater opened last night with "The
Prisoner of Zenda," and a crowded house
assembled to hear the reach- talked-of
tilay.
Most people have read Anthony Hope's
novel, and so much praise has been given
in the East to Edward Rose's dramatiza
tion that "The Prisoner of Zenda"
bad a high reputation to live up to, and
many of the auditors were almost
expecting the disappointments that too
often come when a popular novel is put on
the stage. However, Hope's novel has
had the good fortune to escape injury at
the hands of the dramatist. As a play it
is interesting, romantic and full of action.
At times the action hovers dangerously
near the confines of melodrama, but it
only crosses the border line once or twice
and then but for a brief period. As a rule
the action is too romantic to smack of
melodrama.
The action of the novel in crystallized
into a prologue and four acts. The pro
logue occurs early in the last century,
and has the quaint picturesqueness of
"The School for Scandal" in its settings.
With rapid action the audience is shown
how the Countess of Rassendyll, a young
English woman married to a man who
is much older than herself, has
forgotten her marriage vows for
love of the heir apparent to the throne of
Ruritania. The husband returns home
unexpectedly, and, his eyes opened by the
Prince's cousin and rival in the succession
to the throne, he lays a trap for his wife,
catches the words of love on the Prince's
lips and figuts a duel in which Prince Ru
dolph falls.
This prologue accounts for the startling
likeness which Rudolph Rassendyll, a
young English tourist traveling in Ruri
tanialso years later, bears to Prince Ru
aolph who is on the eve of his coronation as
Rudolph the Fifth. The English tourist
is the great-grandson of the Countess of
Rassendyll.
The leading incidents of the novel have
been cleverly woven by the dramatist into
the play which follows; the Prince is too
drunk to be crowned and his two faithful
officers persuade the Enerlish .tourist to
impersonate royalty for a day. Then fol
j lows the coronation, the love of the
Princess Flavia for the impostor, the
plots and the love complications, ending
in the rescue of the real Prince and the
parting of the lovers for the sake of honor
and duty.
in tne triple role of Prince Rudolph,
Rudolph Filth and the English tourist,
James K. Hackett bore himself very weli.
His part demanded quick transitions and
he gave them with jjreat aptness. The
change from the languid tourist to the
drunken prince was a long step, but
his touch was lightest and surest when
he was supposed to be impersonating
the King at the coronation. The im
postor was as dignified and majestic as a
real Prince, but ever and anon he forgot
his role, spoke with brusqueness and
familiarity or winked with schoolboy fun
at his fellow conspirators, and then pull
ing himself together again became every
inch a King.
At the end of the tnird act the audi
ence demanded a speeeb, to which Hackett
responded with a few jocose remarks on
the silver question and the financial state
secret of Ruritania.
Isabel Irving looked very Dretty in her
red wig as the Princess Flavia.
Her role consisted chitfly of, love
making, which she executed gracefully
and naturally. Maude Odell had to labor
too hard to express the melodramatic
emotions of the unhappy Antoinette de
Mauban, but she seemed to have a eood
conception of her role, though she was
physically not robust enough to render it
comfortably.
Most of the other characters were well
acted. Cnarles Walcot and Howard Gould
were both practical and natural as the
two conspirators who incited the impostor
to impersonate the Prince. Arthur Elliott
was intense and wicked as the treacherous
Black Elphburg, and all the minor char
acters, particularly in the coronation
scene, were clever studies.
"Tne Prisonor of Zenda" gives oppor
tunities for picturesque staging which have
not been neglected.
At tho Grand Opora-Honae.
"The Big Bonanza" at Morosco's kept a large
audience laughing for nearly three hours. It
is one of Daly's best comedies and the intro
duction of the poor old college professor into
the mysteries of the stocit exchange was done
in a way that appealed most forcibly to an au
dience Â«of San Franciscans. L. R. Stockweli as
the professor was even iunnier than usual.
Miss Bateman was very happily cast as Eu
genia, the daugh ter of the rich banker, brother
of the professor, and Lottie Williams as the
professor's daughter also received much ap
plause. Howard Kyie was given an oppor
tunity to do some very effective acting and
took advantage of it. Frank Hatch was the
rich banker who bas retired from business.
His part was well played as was the role of the
dudish Alphonsus de Hass by Edward Herou.
Julia Blanc and Fanny Warner carried the re
maining two chief parts satisfactorily. The
rest of the cast was thoroughly satisfactory,
Mortimer Snow and Harry iJenrimo doing
some very clever work.
Columbia Theater.
"Trilby," on its return from Australia,
opened for a season at the Columbia Theater
last night There was a large house present,
and each familiar character was greeted with
applause oa first appearing; but "Trilby," as
it progressed, did not arouse the enthusiasm
that it was wont to arouse in the days when
Dv Maurier's heroine was the fad of the
hour.
The company was partly the same as that
which first initiated San Francisco to Trilby
ism, and was partly a new and reiincd version
of Palmer's company. Charles Keftt, who
played Svengal;, hnd imitated Beerbohm
Tree more than Wilton Lackaye in Ms
make-up, - and owing to the fart that
he has not Lackaye's dominating
personality, the change was for the better.
His luce did not look as if it had been rubbed
in a flour-barrel, as Lackaye's did, and he had
not Lackaye's red, bee.'y hands. There was a
more Hebraic cast to his countenance and hia
make-up stood the test of the opera-glass bet
ter. .
As for his portrayal of the hypnotist it was
lighter and less intense than Lackaye's and
he affected bis accent; indeed, at times be
forgot his accent altogether and spoke the
unadulterated English of the United States.
The Zou Zou of George H. Trader was not np
to the standard set by Martinelli. Miss Crane
was as handsome as ever as Trilby, and Jennie
KeiU'arth was the same genial Mme. Hiiiard.
Comedy at the Alcazar.
Last evening the entertaining Alcazar com
pany gave Burkstone's old but not worn
comedy "Married Life" to an appreciative au
dience. It 1b a farce of tne most screaming
variety, and as handled by this band of players
loat none of its sparkling humor. The cast
comprised: Samuel Coddle, Frank Doane;
Lionel LyDX, John T. Sullivan; Frederick
Younghusband, F. B. Clayton; Henry Dismal,
Carl Smith; Henry Dove, J. B. Polk; Mrs.
Samuel Coddle, Mrs. F. M. Bates; Mrs. Lionel
Lynx, Amy Lee; Mrs. Frederick Younghus
band, May Buckley; Mrs. Diamal, Hattie
Foley; Mrs. Henry Dove, Mrs. Henry Vandeu
hoff.
As a curtain-raiser the little comedy "In
Honor Bound" was given by John T. Sullivan
as John Carlyon, Gordon Foster as Philip
Graham, Rossella la Faille as Lady Carlyon
and May Buckley as Rose Ualrympie. It was
Miss la Faille's first appearance and the young
lady's work was quite satisfactory. The same
bill will continue aH-the week.
At the Orpheum.
The additions to the Orpheum's bill this
week consist of two freaksâ one a six- year-old
little girl with a phenomenal memory and the
other an armless gentleman, whose feet per
form all the functions of hands.
Little Gertie Cochran, the memory wonder,
shows a positively startling knowledge of his
tory, geography and general statistics. There
is probably not a schoolmaster in the State
who could have responded without stumbling
to all the Questions asked her, but the little
creature never hesitated and was very wide
awake to catch questions which some would-be
smart members oi the audience put to her.
Unthan, the armless wonder, played the vio
lin and cornet with his feet. He also played
cards and generally used his pedal extremities
as dextrously as hands. He went one better
than William Tell by shooting the end off a
gentleman's cigar with a gun handled with
his feet.
Pitrot, the character delineator, is back again,
with a strong flavor of chestnuts clinging to
his performance. The only new character
added to his repertory is Dr. O'Donneli, but
his impersonations of the Congressional can
didates still has power to arouse a great deal
of noise. The Hawaiian band continues to be
popular, but the Audience would probably be
better pleased if the selections were curtailed
in length. The National airs given ty the
plee club arouse great enthusiasm. Master
Walter Leon is deservedly as great a favorite
as ever. Riley and Hughes continue to show
their agility as plantation dancers.
"Satanella" at the Tivoll.
"Satanella" was produced before a large
audience last night and met with a cordial
reception. The principal event of interest was
the first appearance of Ella Crox Seabrooke,
who more than fulfilled what had been prom
ised for her. She is the possessor of a sweet
and youtuful soprano voice of considerable
volume and register and presented a very at
tractive appearance, especially in her doublet
and hose. She was several times called before
the curtain, and received a double encore for
her rendition of "The Power of Love." The
management has a valuable acquisition in
this youni? lady. Rhys Thomas was excellent
as Count Rupert and was loudly applauded for
his singing of "The Sparkling Vintage of
Champagne." Signor Abramhoff sang splen
did as Arimanes and was exceedingly effective
in appearance. Maurice Darcy created a fa
vorable impression as Karl. He has a pleasant
barytone voice. Tho rest ot the cast was sat
lsiactory. "Satanella" will go all the week.
At the Chutes.
Mons. F. A. Maginel, saxophone soloist, who
has been playing with Gilmore and Liberati,
is a new feature of the open-air concerts, while
the cornet solos of the Mullin Sisters are as
popular as ever. To make matters more ex
citing than usual Antonio Pirri now rides
over the cleats down the chutes while the
water is running.
Falrmount Improvement Club.
At a meeting of the Falrmount Improvement

The following commtmicatio i has been
received :
Editor Call : In your notice of my speech lost
Saturday nigut I am made to say that I v anted
to see the Chicago convention "a wild bmÂ»t of
radicalism." This Is a mistake. Isaid in toti c
particular* it was n^t radical enough; that it
should have abolished the two-thirds rule
which isundemocrfttic and wrecked the party
when Douglass and Breckinridge were nomi
nated, and also have recommended the aboli
tion of the Electoral Colleue, giving a direct
vote for President and avoiding complications
such as followed the election of Tilden and
are now met with in the nomination for Vice-
President. The Call has been so uniformly
fair and manly in its treatment of political
opponents that I feel warranted in asking this
correction. Respectfully, Robert Ferral.

FOB PRESIDENT-
WILLIAM McKINLEY, of Ohio
FOR VTCF-PRESIDENTâ
GARRET A. HOBART, of New Jersey
Election November 3, J896.
Stick to straight politics.
Republican unity will win.
Get out and work for Colonel Taylor.
Let Republicans unite and victory is cer
tain.
To divide Republicanism is to multiply
BucKleyism.
Republican loyalty is appealed to and
will respond.
W^io can have confidence in a Non-Par
tisan pledge?
If Mr. Phelan is a Non- Partisan what is
he doing on the Rainey ticket?
Four more weeks of waiting and then
we will put an end to Bryanism.
The campaign music good citizens are
calling for is Republican harmony.
The people are still waiting for some one
to explain what is meant by a Nou-Parti
san legislator.
The movement to bring Bryan to Cali
fornia is a pood one. We ought to have
our share of hippodrome.
A united und aeeressive Republican
party in San Francisco will make Califor
nia a sure thing for McKinkev.
Buckley the Populist, Kainey the Non-
Partisan and Willie Hearst the reformer
are too many fakers for one town.
The only way to save San Francisco from
the Democratic tricksters is for all Repub
licans to unite and work together.
From this time on the campaign will be
redhot, but the heat will vanish pleasantly
in the blaze of Republican bonfires.
If there were a rich man in this town
whose leg cculd be pulled you would see
the Examiner gang licking his boctÃ.
Tom Watson has most conclusively re
futed the report that he was simmering
down by getting up and boiling over again.
Tbe monopoly has lost its hold on tbe
San Joaquin and before long San Fran
cisco will be abie to shake tne shackles off.
Loyal Republicans should unite to si
lence the wranpJers in the ranks. Let us
have no dissensions in the face of the foe.
The end of the campaign will not bring
Mr. Bewail an office, but it will take Tom
Watson of! his back, and that is some
thing.
Czar Nicholas is saying nothing during
his tour of Europe, and so instead of
stumping the country he has stumped the
diplomatists.
Study the municipal situation and you
will see that the only straight ticket is
that headed by Colonel Taylor. All others
are blind leads.
Just before the hurricane Bryan advised
Tillman to go to Florida and take the
stump and is now probably very sorry he
did not insist on it.
Comptroller Eckels makes a good show
ing of money in the banks, but under a
Republican administraticn there would
be more of it in circulation.
Free trade depreciates American indus
try and free silver would depreciate the
American dollar and thus both work and
wages would suffer by the election of
Bryan.
The efforts of the Buckley, Rainey and
Willie Hearst thugs to weaken the influ
ence of John D. Spreckels shows how
much he is doing for good government in
this City.
Fresno was right in making a notable
celebration of the arrival of the first train
of the Valley Railroad. Bhe has now the
competition that will enable her trade to
live and flourish.
When Tom Reed arrives in California
he should find the Republican party as
united In this City as in his own State of
Maine, and receive assurances the State
will vote for protection and prosperity.
As Tom Watson says, "My idea of the
campaign was to be perfectly honest and
make the issue a sectional one," it is easy
to see why ie was dropped. The fusion
ists were willing to make the issue sec
tional, but they do not wish to be honest
about it. _â¢
There may be a Democratic ticket
marked on the official ballot, but there is
no Democratic party in this City. There
is a Populist fusion, a Non- Partisan fusion
and a general confusion in which Democ
racy has been lost to sight like a schooner
ir a fog bank.
THE PEESNO CELEBRATION.
The people of Fresno have rightly made
the opening of the line of the Valley Rail
road to their city the occasion oi a forma!
ceremony of public rejoicing. It is an
event which marks the beginning of a
new epoch in the history of their city and
of the great valley in which it is situated.
Competition is never more truly the life
of trade than whan it causes a reduction
in transportation rates, and in this in
stance it is doubly beneficial, inasmuch as
it has broken down one of the most crush
ing monopolies tnat ever held an Amer
ican community within its grasp.
In her celebration Fresno has the sym
pathy and congratulations of all Califor
nia. Every portion of the State has suf
fered more or less from the blight of the
Southern Pacific domination and monop
oly, and all see in the emancipation of the
San Joaquin an augury and promise of a
coming emancipation for themselves.
Certainly San Francisco can look with
eager expectation for release from the
bonds which have bound her energies and
hampered her trade. The rapid advance
which took place in Los Angeles after the
completion of a competing line which
gave better transportation rates to her
merchants and to the producers in the
region round about her will be repeated
here when like advantages are obtained.
These facts are recognized everywhere,
and as a consequence the celebration at
Fresno is regarded not merely as a gratifi
cation over things accomplished, but as a
rejoicing in the prospect of greater things
to come.
While much of credit and praise is due
to many men for the successful accom
plishment of the line which carries pros
perity to all theregion^of country between
Stockton and Fresno, the people of Cali
fornia will not forget that the success is
mainly due to one manâ Clau3 Spreckels.
At the time when the long projected plan
to construct a competing line down the
San Joaquin was about to be abandoned
he came forward to save it. His very
name gave confidence to the public and
his personal influence was an inspiration to
enterprise. He did not content himself
with that. His wealth, his time, his en
ergy and his sagacity were given to the
work freely and Without stint He made
the prompt beginning and swift construc
tion of the road possible, and it is not too
much to say that it stands to-day an evi
dence of his public spirited industry and
his regard for the welfare of the State.
The road was designed, constructed and
will be operated as a business proposi
tion. Like all the great industries con
ducted or promoted in this State by Mr.
Spreckels, its aim is the increase of wealth
and the advancement of the material
prosperity of California. It has already
effected a vast gain for the people of tbe
San Joaquin. It has carried a profit to
every shipper in the valley, and will con
tinue to yield profits to them, as well as
to the stockholders. Lower freight rates
means more money for farm crops and
cheaper prices lor all goods brought into
the valley. This implies an aDility to
employ more labor and pay more wages.
There will De more comforts in the homes,
as well as more prosperity in the stores,
shops and factories ot- Fresno, and the
people there have a thousand reasons for
rejoicing that California has such a pro
moter of enterprise as Mr. Spreckels
among her citizens.
There is no property in this country that
does not represent the concentrated labor of
the American people. Any policy which
seeks to depreciate the value of labor destroys
in the same degree the value of property,
and every po'icy which seeks to depreciate
the value of property de.tt oys in the same
degree the value of labor. Property and
labor arc children of one flesh and blood. A
policy that diminishes the consuming power
destroys values. All laws should be made
with a view of harmonising their differences
and equalizing their values, and when em
ployment is given to everg idle hand there
will be no surplus of farm products. Con
suming power is increased in the proportion
that men are employed and receive liberal
compensation for their labor. â Mayor Pin
gree oj Detroit.
REPUBLICAN OPPORTUNITY.
Party loyalty, which is at all times de
sirable in the Republican ranks, was never
more important both to the party and to
the people of San Franciaao than at this
time. The Buckley faction of the Demo
cratic party having captured the Populist
municipal convention, and the Rainey
faction haying secured the indorsement of
its candidates for Mayor and for several
other offices by the Non-Partisan conven
tion, it is clear that if the Republican
party should be divided the administra
tion of the City will almost surely pass
into the hands of either Buckley or
Rainey.
While there are these important reasons
for Republican unity, there is no reason
at all for party dissensions. All contro
versies which existed between Republi
cans in this City have been appealed to
the Republican State Central Committee
and have been by that committee decided.
No one questions the impartiality of the
committee; no one questions that it de
cided according to law, precedent and the
universal practice of political parties in
this State and throughout the Union. It
upheld the regularly organized party, as
it was bound to do. Therefore all loyal
Republicans are in honor bound by that
decision. There can be no party disci
pline if there should be any widespread
revolt against the decision of the State
Central Committee. Only by obedience
to such decision is party organization pos
sible. Only by such obedience can the
party be a self-governing body. Only by
submission to the authority of State
Central Committees can there be any such
a thing as party suece-s.
It should not be necessary to appeal to
the loyalty of Republicans to support the
decision of the committee. That loyalty
ought to respond of itself, and without
appeal, in a case where party unity is so
important as now. What can any Repub
lican expect to gain by dividing the party
in San Francisco in the face of such oppo
sition as is arrayed against it? Would it
profit any Republican or any citizen to
defeat Colonel Taylor and elect the candi
date nominated by either Buckley or
Rainey?
As was pointed out by Mr. Sonntag in
his letter declining to be a candidate for
Mayor, when such candidacy meant the
division of the Republican party, if the new
charter should be carried, the next Mayor
of this City will have extraordinary powers
in the municipal government. Can any
Republican or any good citizen afford to
take the risks of defeating Colonel Tavior
under such circumstances? The issues
involved in the contest are too great to be
set aside on account of p^tty differences of
opinion or minor questions of party or
ganization. The time calls for Republi
can loyalty. There should be no slightest
attempt made to carry the past unfortu
nate dissensions in the party any further.
Let us one and all give cordial support to
the State Central Committee and to the
ticket which it has declared to be regular,
rightful and just. Let us work from this
time on to carry San Francisco by such a
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 6, 1896.
Republican majority as will not only elect
Colonel Taylor and his ticket but make
California safe for McKinley and Hobart.
The Republican platform adopted at St.
Louis pledges the party to the time-honored
principle of protection. No other platform
does. This has always been a fundamental
Republican principle. To abandon it would
be to comviit this Nation to the present policy
of the Democratic parly, which policy, I be
lieve, has been largely instrumental in bring
ing us to oar present condition. Can we con
sent to such an abandonment? las a business
man cannot. â Mayor Pingree of Detroit.
SILVER AND WHEAT.
The silver men have all along claimed
that the price of wheat follows the price of
silver, and tbat so long as silver falls in
the market, there will be falling prices for
agricultural products. They have claimed
therefore that the remonetization of
silver is essential to the improve
ment of the farming interests of the
world. By these reasons they have ral
lied to their support many farmers, and
no doubt a large portion of their strength
elsewhere has been due to the persistency
with which they insist on this relation be
tween the price of silver and that of
wheat.
Events now occurring effectually dis
prove all the arguments based upon this
assumption. Wheat is at this time rising
in the market, and has already advanced
something like 20 per cent. Meantime,
the price of silver continues nearly sta
tionary, and with a downward tendency.
It is clear, in tbe face of existing condi
tions that the relation between silver and
wheat assumed by the silver men and be
lieved in by the farmers is false. Wheat
and silver stand each upon its own basis.
The price of the one does not affect the
other.
With the present rise in wheat, farmers
may safely vote for the maintenance of
the existing gold standard, until such a
time as international bimetallism may be
brought about. They can see for them
selves that the price of wheat does not de
pend upon the price of silver. Let them
vote for protection and sound money and
they may count upon a return of pros
perity at once.
The greatest creditors of this country to-day
are the workingmen. Aside from what is due
them upon investments and savings, their cur
rent wages make them the largest creditor
class in the United States. The employers of
this countrg owe their employees every thirty
days, in good times, more than the bonded
debt of the United States. Nearly $500,000,000
is paid annually to the railroad employes
alone. Dues the railroad employe propose to
aid any party to enact legislation which will
cut his payroll from 25 to 50 per cent in the
name of a cheap dollar f â McKinley.
TOM WATSON'S TIGHT.
The report that Tom Watson, despond
ent and despairing, was ready to abandon
the fi^ht for recognition as a candidate for
Vice-President on the Bryan ticket has
b?en refuted by Watson himself in the
most effectual way. He bhs made upon
bewail and the fusionists an attack more
vehement and more bitter than ever. He
has given notice to friend and foe alike
that he is still in the fight and proposes to
make it as disagreeable for the other fel
low as possible.
When Tom Reed called Watson "the
colt of a wild ass" he gave a picturesque
prominence to one of the salient charac
teristics of the man, but he did injustice
to another. Watson's voice ia something
more than braying. He is a fighter, this
fellow, and evidently honest It cannot
be doubted he could make good terms with
the Fopocrat manaeers to retire or be
silent, and that he has done neither is
pretty sure proof that beneath bis wild
ness of language and his lack of personal
dignity there is some really manly stuff
in him.
It would tax the decorum of the most
self-contained of men to maintain a posi
tion like that of Watson without being
ridiculous, and the half-tutored, vocifer
ous Georgian is not wholly responsible for
the fortune that nas made him the laugh
ing stock of the campaign. His harangues
have been foolish in manner only. The
substance of them has shown more
courage, honesty and consistency than
have those of the very dignified leaders of
the fusion who have betrayed him.
There is none of the trickster, trader or
political faker in Tom Watson. If the
Populist party is swallowed up by Democ
racy it will be through no fault of his.
On the contrary, he is doing much to
force the fusion tricksters to show their
hands. He will have none of their kind
of politics. "If those wno have been false
to the mandate of the Populist conven
tion," said he on Sunday, "really desire
to kill the party they picked out the
wrong man when they named me. I will
make no compromises." On that ground
he stands, and whatever fun may be
made of him the people have more respect
for him than for any of the Populists who
nave betrayed their party to the Demo
cratic bosses for the sake of getting an
office ior themselves.
Ido not believe that the mere question of a
change in our standard of value is irivo'ved.
Behind the forces advocating the free andun
i limited coinage of silver at the ratio of 16
lo 1 and the reorganization of the ,United
States Supreme Court are arrayed repudiation,
defiant contempt of established authority and
the exponents of expediency, rather than of
principle, whose radicalism is a threat to the
stability of our institutions. â Son. James A.
Donnelly of New York.
A FORLORN HOPE,
The proposal of the silver men to bring
Mr. Bryan to California may be taken as
an evidence of the complete desperation
of the silver party. Their attempt to
achieve success by a fusion of Democrats
and Populist 3 seems to have been a com
plete failure. Neither party to the fusion
has been content with the other, and if
they are to be held together in this State
it can be done only by a personal appeal
from the man who has chosen to be the
standard-bearer of both in the Presiden
tial race.
Never was the futility of political fusion
more clearly shown than in this case.
Wh n the campaign began tnere was
every prospect that Democrats, Populists
and Republican free-silver men might be
brought together to support a candidate
on the single issue of the remonetization
of silver. As time has passed, however, it
has become more and more evident that
the attempt under such leadership as
that which i as tried to organize the pres
ent fusion is impossible. No lead r of
National fame has taken the field to assist
Mr. Bryan. He has been left to make the
fight alone, and everywhere in the ranks
there is apparent nothing but discord,
confusion, wrangling and demoralization.
Where are the Democratic silver lead
ers? Where are Bland and Boies, and
Senators Morgan, Vest, Voorhees and
Daniel ? Where are the Populist lead
ers â Butler, Peffer, Allen and Simpson?
Where are thfc fret-silver Republicans â
Teller, Dubois and others ? Where are
the Democratic leaders in this State â
Budd, Foote and English? Why is it that
in California none is left to fight the bat
tie for silver except Mr. Cator and such
Democrats as are willing to make trades
with him for the spoils of office ?
Surely it ia time to bring Mr. Bryan to
California and see if he can do anything
to rally the demoralized forces. It is not
certain that even his presence could bring
harmony out of so much discord, or recon
cile stanch Democrats to the election of
Cator to the Senate, or stanch Populists
to the betrayal of their party by Cator
for Democratic votes. Nevertheless, the
thing is worth trying. It is a forl >m
hope, but without that there is no hope
at all.
How wtll free silver stop the importation of
foreign woolt How can free silver chec k the
appalling importations of woolen goods from
the Old World? How can free silver preserve
the home market to the wool producer and the
woolen manufacturer? | Renewed cries of "It
can't do it!"] How can free silver increase
the demand for American labor and Ameri
can products? Answer me that.â McKinley.
BEWALL'S GOLD BASIS.
Candidate Sewall admits that he requires
those who charter his tbips to stipu
late in the contract that payment shall
be made in gold. He cays he would
be perfectly willing to take silver or cur
rency in payment "if custom permitted."
As Mr. Sewall's ships are in international
trade he refers to an international custom
which does not sanction the payment of
freight charges in anything but gold. But
why does such a custom prevail? That is
the question. Mr. Sewall knows, but to
answer the question would be to flatly
contradict the platform upon which he
thinks ne ia running for the Vice-Presi
dency of tbe United States.
In the first place Mr. Sewall inserts the
gold-payment clause in charter contracts
to prevent the possibility of tenders of
silver in payment, and in the second place
he prefers gold to silver. It follows, there
fore, that Mr. Sewall is a "goldbug" when
transacting business for Mr. Sewall, and a
siiverite when playing politics. Mr.
Sewall says he is well satisfied that the
Bryan and Sewall ticket will be elected,
but he admits by demanding gold for the
use of his ships that Bryan's election
would not give silver any better standing
than it now has in international com-
merce. Then why does he advocate the
opening of the mints to the free coinage of
silver?
It must be that Mr. Sewall believes with
our own T. V. Cator that American silver
dollars would be no good in international
trade under free coinage independent of
other countries. If so, it is easy enough
to see what Mr. Sewail is after. Accord
ing to Cator independent free coinage by
this country would not advance the bul
lion price of silver abroad, and foreign
owners of silver bullion would have to
spend the American dollars they had it
converted into in this country. Now let us
see how such Bryanism would work for Mr.
Bewail. He could have his ships return
to America from foreign ports with bullion
silver at a cost of about 65 cents an ounce.
Then he could have the bullion run
through an American mint, where it would
be legal tender for $1 29 per ounce. With
his legal-tender silver he could buy Ameri
can farm products, paying for them in
silver at the rate of $1 29 an ounce, but
which cost him only 65 cents an ounce.
Evidently Mr. Sewall knows what
he is about when he puts his ships
on a gold basis, but what do Ameri
can farmers think of his scheme? It is
highly important to American producers
that they should look into this matter,
and as Mr. Sewall is so far away perhaps
Mr. Cator would be kind enough to ex
plain to California farmers the mysteries
of Sewail's free-silver gold-basis propo
sition.
THE SAD, SAD SEA.
"What makes the sea so sad, mother?"
Whispered a little child.
"Why do the billows sigh and break,
And why ar* the waves so wild?"
'â The rivers run down to the sea
With all their grief, m â¢ lad,
And flood the sea with their misery,
And that's why the sea Is sad."
â â¢The Hudson pcs with Gotham's woes,
And Parts chokes the Seine:
The Dauu be bl v- and the dark Thames, too,
All hurry to tbe main:
Losing the sons of tbe running rill,
But keeping all that's bid;
They flood the nea with their misery,
And that's why the uea is sad."
Cy Wabican in New York Sun.
LADY'S JACKET WITH REEFER
FRONT.
Jackets this season are short, extending only
eight to twelve inches below the waist. Jacket
sleeves will necessarily remain large, but will
be closer fitting on the forearm. French
ree'er fronts are much lilted and are faced
with the cloth, so they may be turned back
and worn tpen. Some of the most stylish
show only one row of buttons, though two
rows are Btill used.
The jacket shown here is made with the
usual forms in the back; the fronts are seam
less.
Very fine whipcords in tan are much liked
for young ladles, and are made quite dressy
by the use of white cloth for revers and collar,
white pearl buttons are shown on these jack
ets. Light brown covert cloth makes a useful
garment for wearing with other colors.
The model is an excellent one for making
suits of serge or tweed. The skirt should be
plain and stiffened only ten inches all around
the bottom. Braid as well as velveteen is
used for finishing the foot of such skirts,
which are usually about four and a half yards
wide.
Blue serge holds its own for such suits, and
is as serviceable for traveling and general wear
as any to be found.
Mixed cheviots are much used for skirts and
jackets, but there is a preference lor plain
cloth jackets, with skirts of mixtures or
checks.
DO WORKMEN FEAR HIGH WAGES?
sm Diego Tribune.
Who ever before heard of workmen striking
against too high wages? That is precisely
what they are going to do if they vote for
Bryan. He says the gold which they now re
ceive for their labor has too large a purchasing
power, and he offers th^m a silver dollar
which will be a sure remedy for the complaint
aeainst the gold doliar. It will buy just half
as much. Every wageworker who thinks his
earnings too high may consistently vote for
Bryan.
Gadzooksâ Did the play go last night?
Zoundsâ Well, hardly; but you ought to
have seen the audience.â New York Tribune.
AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
General William Ward fiuffield, superintend
ent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, has left
for Washington, having been called thither by
a telegram cutting short his stay in this City,
where he was the recipient of many courtesies.
He has been recently engaged in an inspection
of the Coast Survey parties in Alaska, and
more especially interested In connection with
the location of the boundaries between that
Territory and British Columbia.
Many of tbe citizens of California are un
aware of the fact that the general is a pioneer
of the Pacific Coast, having, while in the
military service of the Federal Government,
made a trip across the plains in 1849. Start
ing from Fort Laramie in May of that eventful
year he commanded a cavalry escort of twenty
five picked men to convey Paymaster Major
Leonard a:id treasure with which to pay off
troops at the several stations en route. In the
train were four wagon-loads of specie, three
containing silver and one gold. Hostile In
dians were encountered, and in one "scrap"
Dufneld, then a young officer of 25 years, had
his arm pierced by an arrow. OnÂ« of three
friendly Delaware Indians in tue party,
named Black Beaver, played tha part of
â¢'medicine man" with such success as to ex
tract tho weapon from the wound, which
speedily healed after suppuration.
The cavalcade marched trom Fort Laramie to
Fort Pedance, thence to Fort Independence, to
Walla Walla on the Columbia River, to Asioria
and finally down the coast to Pan Francisco.
In October, 1849, Dufliela returned overland
to Washington.
His subsequent career as a brave, gallant
and honorable officer culminated in his ap
pointment to the onerous and responsible
position conferred upon him by the General
Government in 1894.
The Society of California Pioneers hope ere
long to have the pleasure of electing him to
life membership in their fraternity.
Richard P. Miner, the attorney and ex-mem
ber of the Legislature of Mono County, is
among the arrivals here. Mr. Miner has lived
there for many years. He went to Bodie when
it wasa booming mining camp in the seventies.
"There are several new things under way up
there," said Mr. Miner last evening. "One of
the very important things is a new sixty-stamp
mill in the town of Bodie. That mill is des
tined to do a whole lot for the place. Then,
besides that, the Goleta, Sterling and Montecito
mining companies, superintended by Steve
Roberts, is going to build a forty-stamp mill.
These claims are between Lundy and Bodie, at
Copper Mountain.
"In addition to this the Dunderberg mine,
twelve miles from Bridgeport, is building a
twenty-stamp mill. You can guess that all
these things help us out a good deal.
"By the way, they are going to nominate me
for County Judge up there in about a week.
Is there any opposition? No, none at all, they
are going to give it to me unanimously;
they've all got together and agreed to do this.
Yes, I will take it, I told them I would, if they
would do this. I have no doubt that I will be
elected."

CALIFORNIA FARMERS NOT BLIND.
Santa Bosa Republican.
Every fruit tree in California will be more
valuable if McKinley is elected than if Bryan
wins and yet there are people who claim that
California farmers will vote against their own
interests. We will chance the good sense of
the fruit-growers and general farmers of So
noma county on this proposition.

C. A. Danaâ l. shall vote for McKinley be

and saving this country from ruin.
Bourke Cockranâ l shall continue to main
tain an uncompromising opposition to Till
manism and Bryanisra until tbe end of the

the party to whose success I have contributed

W. J. BRYAN'S LONELY CAMPAIGN
Brains of the Democracy Abe Against Him.
New York Post.
The Nashville American complains that
"the big guns of the Democratic party" are
not stumping for Bryan, and suggests that ''it
"it is about time tliey were entering the cam
paign, getting to work making speeches, and
in other ways helping to encourage the people
in the support they are giving to the Chicago
nominees and platform."
This disinclination on the part of the big
guns is remarkable. It is unprecedented.
The repudiation campaign now rests almost
solely on the feeble shoulders of Bryan alone.
Nowhere do we hear of any leading Demo
crats who are making themselves prominent
in it. Even if they accept the Chicago plat
form with actual or assumed belief in silver
ism, or support it and its candidate <>n the
plea of ''regularity," they are wholly silent,
or the words of encouragement asked for from
them by the Nashville Bryanite paper are few
and cold. We see no reports of great speeches
made by any of them in his behalf.
Aitgeld and Tthman seem to have monopo
lized the oratorical campaigning, with the
single exception of Bryan bimtelf. The can
didate is left to bear the chief burden of the
canvass alone, and it is putting a cruel strain
on him. Bryan is working too hard, but how
can he do else when there seems to be no one
oi his many professed followers willing to
lend him assistance in the stumping, at least
no one of consequence enough to command
public attention. On the other side the ar
tillery of "big guns" is of greater power than
ever before in our political history, including,
as it does, the largest guns of botn Democracy
ami .Republicanism.
It is a very remarkable situation, but the
reason for it is plain. As Sam Small remarked
a few weeks ago, the brains of the country are
aeainst Bryan, and there is nothing leu for
him but weak intellects, pretentious igno
ramuses, self-advertising humbugs, social in
cendiaries like Altgeld and Tillman and po
litical hypocrites who are ashamed to show
themselves before the people as advocates of
doctrines in which they make a rretense of
believing, but which really are abhorrent to
their convictions and intuiting to their intel
ligence. __^___________

visors, some by the County Clerk and others
by the heads of departments. The Janitors of
the School Department are appointed by the
Board of School Directors. Tneir salaries
amount in the aggregate to about $50,000 a
year.
French War Debtâ W. R., Santa Rosa, Cal.
The iudemnity which France had to pay after
the close of the Franco-Prussian war in 1871
was five milliards of francs, equal to one bil
lion of our dollars. One milliard was paid
in 1871 and the remainder was paid by the
end of September in 1873. The indemnity
was met altogether in bills of exchange drawn
against exported merchandise. These bills of
exchange, in their turn, represented the sub
scriptions to the extraordinary loan author
ized by the French Government and taken by
the French people to liquidate the debt.
Etestoneâ A. T. v., City. The eyestone Is
taken from a certain species of small seashell
found principally on the South American
coast. It is the mouthpiece, or Iront door, so
to speak, of the shell and is shaped with a
convex surface on one side, while the other is
flat, and the larjrest specimens are not more
than one-third of an inch in diameter. Hum
boldt, the great traveler, found this stone
used by the South Americans to remove for
eign substances from the eye, hence the name.
When put under the lid oi the eye the stone
is moved by the motion of the eyeball and lit
tle particles which it touches adhere to it and
may be removed with it There is a belief
that these stones are alive, because when
placed in any weak acid, as limo juice or
vinegar, they will move about This is owing
to the evolution of carbonic acid gas by the
dissolving of some of the carbonates of lime in
the shell by contact with the acitf , and the lit
tle bubbles of gas move the stone back and
forth in the fluid.
The Centuryâ N. D., City. This corre
spondent like many people is troubled as to
the century. He asks it this is the ninety
sixth or ninety-seventh year of this century,"
and adds that "a friend claims that the twen
tieth century will commence on the Ist of
1 January, 1900, and that another claims that
it will not commence until January 1, 1901."
The following from a recent editorial in the
Boston Herald is a very full and clear answer
to the question :
Already the discussion ha* taken shape, and
arguments have been put forth on cither side of
the question at Issue, which is: Will the nine
teenth century end with the closing of the year
1899, or muÂ»t â¢ we wait, until December 31, 1900,
has passed before we can we come In the to be
wonderful twentieth - century? There are dis
tinctly two sides to this question, and each side is
in a position to bring forward quite a number cl
arguments In support of its own method of con
struction. ' Under the ordinary conditions of
numeration a full hundred is not complete !, or,
rather, a new hundred Is not begun, until me full
tale has been counted. . :"-;.
If A agreed to take the first hundred apples
from a trre and B the second uundre'l. B mud .
hardly demand the right to begin bis count when J
A had droppel his ninety-ninth app.e into the
barrel. The new hundred, or the new teutury,
would, under such construction, begin not witn
an,o. bat with a 1. Ihe 0 wou d represent the
win Ing up and closing of the ol . century, and tee
1 the beginning or opening up of a new century.
On this basis or calculation the twentieth century
would not begin until after midnight on the 31st
of December, .900. Or, to state the same mutter
n other words, the twentieth century would begin
on January 1, 1901. .
This seems to be a reasonaole setting forth of
the proposition until we come to consider the
other side of the case, which Is that our system of
calculating time In based upon the blrtn of Christ.
We ak of the present year as A. D. 1896; Id
other words, assuming this basis of calculation,
we are now in the 1897 th year of our Lord, Just
as, in speaking of a chl.d who has passed Its
twelfth birthday, we say that be Is now In his
teens: that la to say, he has completed his twelfth
year and Is in his thirteenth. . If a child Is 1 year
ana eighth month* oul we say he is In his second
year. These calculations are based on the reason
able ground that. In concrete reckonings of time
and space, we do not begin with 1. but with 0,
and there is a space between 0 and 1, as there Is
between 1 and 2, -
In a word, the difference Is found In the use of a
cardinal In contradistinction to an ordinal num
ber. If a man can be said to be In bis fiftieth
rear after he has passed forty-nine, so the century
may be said to be be twentieth century after the
clock has rung oat midnight on the 31 it of De
cember, 189Â». But, us this led to warm discus
si' n a century ago, it is not Improbable that It
will be equally a subject of dispute during the
next three years. It Is not, it is true, a matter of
weighty Importance, having much less practical
bearing upon the welfare of mankind than the
settlement of the silver contention, but it merely
indicates how persons may arrive at different con
clusions from a statement of the same set of facts.

Another vessel that is among the miss
| ing is the Chilean bark Lake Leman. She
! was in collision with the Italian bark
Lazzero on September 16, and has not
since been heard from. The authorities
at Victoria, B. C, have sent the light
house boat Quadra out to look for the
missing vessel at the request of the
Chilean Consul at Port Townsend. The
i Lazzero reached port a couple of weeks
ago.
The California Transportation Com
pany's chartered Bteamer Alvira is
[ sunk in Steamboat Slough. She was
'â  making her way . down to the
j main channel when a snag was
struck and in a few minutes the vessel
sank in shallow water. The engine-room
and hold were flooded, but the cargo of
produce on the upper deck did not suffer.
It will be unloaded into another of the
company's boats and will reach San Fran
cisco to-day. Captain Nelson, one of the
managers of the company, went up last
niizht to the scene of , the wreck and took
one of Whitelaw's pumps along with him.
It is his intention to build a box around
the hole and then pump tlie vessel out.
Should this prove a success the Alyira
will ba towed to San Francisco for repairs.
I The Alvira will be remembered as the
j steamer which Mayor Duvie employed in
.his fiuht against the Southern Pacific fora
5-ceut fare to Oakland.
The crew of the sealing schooner Luisa
D are jubilant over the showing raadt by
their vessel. She beat the entire fleetf rom
Yokohama to the Bering Sea, and on nor
way here passed the Alton, Carlotta G.
Cox, Rattler, Otto and other smart sailers
in Oonamak Pass. The Luisa Dis safe in
pore, but the other vessels have not yet
reported.
The hunters on the Luisa D are com
plaining over ths way things were han
dled in Bering Sea by the patrol fleet.
They say American vessels were com
pelled to hunt with spears while the Brit
ishers used guns. "On several occasions
when we were out we could see the guns
of the other boats going," said Harry Ker
lie yesterday, "but we bad to depend on
spears. It was generally rough and blow
ing hard, bo you can imagine what a time
we had in getting any seals. Occasionally
we ran across a seal that bad been shot
and we secured him, but all around the
catch was poor. Many an English boat
was seized by the American cutters and
turned over to the British gunboats, but
as soon as that ceremony was over the
Britishers released the sealers. Borne cf
them went to Victoria', B. C, and gave
themselves up, but many others did not.
"We are all wondering about the
schooner Edward A. Webster. On April
23 she and the Herman were in company.
It was blowing a heavy gale from the
northwest at the time, but tne Herman
weathered it and reached port. The Web- .
ster has not been heard from since. Per
haps some of the incoming fleet will bring
news of her."
All the hunters on the smart little
schooner are satisfied to make another
venture next season. They did remark
ably well considering the time they were
out, but, nevertheless, did not pay ex
penses. Still they think skins will be dear
on account of the poor catch of the entire
fleet, and that will mean more money for
the hunters.
A. C. Johnson, the boatman, picked up
a yawl about sixteen feet long yesterday.
It is painted blue on the bottom, and has
the appearance of a pleasure boat. It has
probably got. ad rift from some yacht.
Johnson can be found at 107 Jackson street.
Purser Thomas Smith of the steamer
Mariposa was discussing the matter of
losing a day and gaining a day in going to
and coming from Australia. That is one
of tbe questions he has to answer every
time the vessel crosses the 180 th meridian.
In order to be ready at a moment's notice
he has prepared the following and now
knows it by heart:
"The common day, often called the civil
day, lasts from midnight to midnight. â 
"In order that tne civil day may have
the same number or date the world around
the leading nations have agreed to use the
date of the days as they begin at the 180 th
meridian."
For instance, a purser traveling west
ward from Greenwich would have to put
back his time four minutes for every de
gree of longitude he traveled, and by the
time he reached the 180 th degree of longi
tude this would amount o twelve hours,
which his time would be behind that of
Greenwich. If he continued right on by
the time he reached Greenwich again he
would be exactly twenty-four hours (or
one da\ T ) behind Greenwich time.
"To adjust this difference it is the custom
to drop one day entirely on crossing the
180 th meridian. Thus if you cross that
line on nay April 1, which we will pre
sume is Monday, the next day will be
Wednesday. April 3, Tuesday the 2d being
omitted entirely. This places the traveler
twelve hours, or half a day, ahead of
Greenwich time and as he still continues
to put nis time back four minutes for each
degree he travels westward by the time he
again reaches Greenwich |he will find his
time exactly correct, the twelve hours he
was ahead after crossing the 180 th merid

ian having been thn smadeup by putting
his time back four minutes for every de
gree he traveled.
"Reversely a passenger traveling east
ward puts his time forward four minutes
for every degree traveled and thus will on
reaching the 180 th meridian be twelve
hours ahead of Greenwich time. Instead
of dropping a day he adds a day to the
calendar, and presuming he crosses the
180 th meridian on Monday, Aprii 1, the
following day will again be Monday, April
1, this case being exactly the reverse of
the former."
Uncle Sam has promulgated a new list
of punishments for use in tbe navy. The
circular arrived here last week. Murder
is the only crime which carries the death
penalty. An officer using profane lan
guage may be sentenced to lose two num
bersâthat is he must remain in his present
position until two juniors have been
passed over his head. A sailor gets thirty
days in irons on bread and water.
An officer who lies can be dismissed, a
sailor d<shonorably discharged.
An officer of the deck found drnnk
loses ten numbers, while a sailor gets
six months; an officer using abusive
language will be publicly reprimanded,
while a sailor will get six months' impris
onment.
Any enlisted man who at rollcall shall
answer fora shipmate may get six months.
Any officer guilty of maltreating his men
will be dismissed. Smuggling liquor is
punishable with a six months' imprison
ment and dishonorable discharge, while
an officer found gambling will be dis
missed and Jack will get six months and
be dishonorably discharged.
Going to sleep on the lookout means a
year's imprisonment and discharge, while
â¢' irreverant or unbecoming belieavior dur
ing divine service" means the loss of
three numbers for an officer and three
months for Jack. Mutiny means ten
years, and dueling means dismissal to an
officer and a year's imprisonment for a
sailor. Thus it goes on through every de
linquency for which a ?ai lor can be pun
ished, and every one of the punishments
are jusi as heavy as those quoted.
SHE WAS JEALOUS.
Annie Conroy Quarrel* With Her Lover
and Swallows a Dose
of Poison.
Annie Conroy, 23 years of age, swal
lowed a dose of poison yesterday after
noon, and in all probability it will prove
fatal.
The girl and her sister Jennie lived with
Mrs. Ferral, 532 Jessie street. All the par
ties interested are reticent as to the rea
son of tbe girl's action. Her friends say
she did it as a "josh," but it is suspected
that jealousy was the real cause.
She had been using a mixture of chloral
and camphor as a face wash and it was
this mixture tnat she swallowed. She was
tick in bed yesterday and about 2 o'clock
in tbe afternoon J. C. St. John, ass stant
general manager of the Medical and Den
tal Protective Association, and her sister
were in the room. Sbe asked for the mix
ture and a wine glass and filled the glass
about full. Before St. John and her sister
could realize what she was to do she
laughingly said, "I am going to take this,"
and swallowed it. Sbe soon became un
conscious and Dr. Fitch was summoned.
He advised that sbe should be taken to
the Receiving Hospital and the ambu
lance was sent for. Her chances of recov
ery are doubtful.
St. John said be was a friend of tho
family and took an interest in the girls, as
be knew their father as a miner in Redding.
He finally admitted that the girl had
taken the poison through jenlousy after
sbe had quarreled with her lover.
The girl did not. regain consciousness
and died about 8 o'clock last night. Her
body was taken to an undertaking estab
lishment by consent of the Coroner, but
an inquest will be held.

GUSTAV WALTEK'S MOVE.
Sufficient Options Secured and Enough
Capital in Sight to Insure
Success.
Gustav Walter, proprietor of the Or
pheum, is approaching the culmination
of a grand scheme which he has had in
view and in preparation for some time.
This is nothing less than the establish
ment of a chain of theaters under one
management from New York to the Pa
cific Coast, this theatrical chain being part
of a system of which the two ends will be,
respectively, in England and Australia.
Mr. Walter has put in much time making
tbe arrangements and carrying on the ne
gotiations necessary and preliminary to
perfecting this extensive and somewhat
Napoleonic move.
Tbe information is given out at the Or
pheum that Mr. Walter has negotiations
pending for one of two theaters In New
York, that he has options upon places of
amusement in Chicago, Cincinnati and St.
Louis, and that he has entered into pre
liminaiy negotiations for a theater in
Denver. The alliance necessary to the
success of an English-Australian circuit
has already been perfected upon the basis
of an exchange of stock of the Orpheum
circuit with the general company, the
name of which is not furnished, at the
head of the English part of the deal. Mr.
W alter has made a deal at Los Angeles
for control.
Tbe real advantage of this, as it is ex
plained, is that a company can be booked
for the English circuit, the American cir
cuit and the Australian circuit and make
an uninterrupted progress from one end of
the line to the other, without long skips
and without being compelled to make
long stands at any one place to recoup for
the large expenses en route which would
have been incurred under the old and
more diffuse system. This measure of
economy and long engagements will en
able the management to give a rotation of
first-class companies and to put on suc
ceeding attractions every week.
Mr. Walter will not finally close deals in
the East until he can go "there and per
sonally attend to the matter. The option
that he has secured leaves no doubt in his
mind that the arrangements can be olosed
up with very little delay. ThiÃ will be the
largest circuit upon earth when it is finally
pieced together, and is the largest that ha
ever been attempted.
DETERMINED TO DIE.
Odilon Lefebvre, s Lovelorn Youth,
Make* Two Attempts by Gas
Asphyxiation.
Odilon Lefebvre, a collector for the Im
perial Tea Company, living with his
mother at 978 Howard street, twice at
tempted within twenty-four hours to end
his life by gas asphyxiation. The cause
was disappointment in love.
Sunday night he was discovered in his
room in an unconscious condition with
the gas turned on. A physician was sum
moned, and after worfcing ou him for
some time he was brought back to con
sciousness. Yesterday afternoon he was
again found in his room in a similar con
dition. This time the ambulance was sum
moned and be was taken to the Receiving
Hospital, where he soon drew out of
danger.
Odilon is 23 years of age. Some months
ago he mat and fell in love with May
Kelly, a pretty eirl 16 years of age. May
was for a time flattered by his attentions,
but his mother forbade him keeping com-
Eany with her as she was too young, and
c had not sufficient income to keep a
wife.
He planned a scheme to hire a tug and
be married at sea, but tbe scheme fell
through, and recently May refused to keep
company with him any longer. Life was
not worth the living without May, so
when his mother went to the country on
Saturday for a few days he determined to
seek consolation in death. He has not yet
succeeded.
THEY TORE UP FENCES,
A Gang of Tough Young Hood
lums Returning From
Harbor View.
An Old-Time Sunday Picnic Crowd
of Roughs Break the Union-
Street Car Windows.
The residents alone the line of Union
street, near Steiner, are cherishing a fond
hope that the picnic season will come to
an early close. There is not a Sunday
that has passed in the last two months
that they have not been made the victims
of vandal hoodlums returning from Har
bor View Park or the Germ an ia Gardens,
the men filled with whisky and a desire to
make themselves particularly obnoxious.
Sunday night, hoars after the better
element had returned home from tho
Austrian picnic, a crowd of roughs, about
twelve in number, boarded the cars in
ward-bound and, in their usual insulting
way, intimidated and browbeat the other
passengers and refused to pay their fares.
This necessitated the joint action of the
eripman and conductor armed with an
iron hook and a crowbar to e]ect the
rowdies.
They were not put off, however, without
breaking the car windows and the gang
would then adjourn to celebrate at the
nearest saloon. Quarrels among them
selves as they became drunker were more
frequent, but these fisticuffs were forgot
ten'as soon as the next car hove in sight,
when a recurrence of the "fun" was in
order. Without paying a cent for trans
portation the crowd, in this manner,
reached Seiner and Union streets and
began drinking again.
By this time they had become tired of
being put off the cars and decided to arm
themselves against the carmen. One van
dal, worse than the others, led them to the
picket fence surrounding the Pixley lot
and in short order each tough bad secured
a sharpened board, leaving wide gaps in
the fence. Not content with this, they
ripped up a seven-step stairway and
landed it on the car-tracks.
In the meantime the first two cars that
had been visited by the ruffians bad tele
phoned for police assistance, which was
promptly furnished. As the club-wield
ers came in sight there was a general
scampering of hoodlums, who dropped
their pickets and mixed in the crowd
homeward bound, annoying them ouiy
with their profanity.

CRASHED INTO
A BEER WAGON
Five Persons Injured by a
Street Juggernaut on
Broadway.
An Electric Car and Brewery
Cart Demolished in
Collision.
ACCOUNT OF AN EYE-WITNESS.
F, Meeks Accuses the Motorman of
Gross Carelessness in Exceeding
the Proper Sp:ed.
At 8:20 A. x. yesterday a Kearny-street
electric-car crashed into a St. Louis
Brewery wagon on Broadway, between
Dupont street and Montgomery avenue,
with terrific force, resulting in severe in
jury to five persons.
The names of the injured are: Herman
fiehlman, driver for theSt Louis Brewery,
badly sprained back and lacerated wound
on the forehead; Ferdinand Duranthal,
employe of the St. Louis Brewery, severe
contusions and trifling wound on leg;
Mrs. Helvogt, 1602 Stockton street, badly
wrenched shoulder and suffering from
hysteria; Mary, Mrs. Helvogt's daughter,
aged 11, several insignificant bruises;
Joseph Dominique, 605 Broadway, badly
bruised about body and head.
Dominique was the most badly injured
of all, but will recover unless internal in
juries deveiop. He is now at the French
Hospital and late last night was reported
to be doing well.
Taking the manner of the accident into
consideration it seems miraculous that
every person on the car was not killed out
right. From the statement of Federico
Meeks, a merchant located at 213 Front
street, an eye-witness, it appears that the
electric-car, in charge of motorman 907
and conductor 944, was running along
Broadway on a downgrade at a high rate
of speed. Directly in front was a St. Louis
Brewery wagon proceeding in the same
direction, with Behlman, the driver, and
Doranthal upon the seat.
As the car gained rapidly upon the
wa^on it suddenly seemed to occur to the
motorman that he must stop immediately
to escape a collision. Accordingly he
broke the circuit and applied tbe brake
with all his power, at tne same time
sounding the bell once. Before he couid
sound it again the shock came.
With an awful crash the car struck the
rear of the wagon and in a twinkling both
were completely wrecked. With such
force did the car strike the wagon that the
latter was carried fifty feet, throwing the
horses down and passing over them,
while wagon, beer barrels and broken
harness formed a mass of confusion.
The front platform of the car was
smashed to splinters. Glass flew in every
direction. Even the running gear was
damaged to a considerable extent. Tne
two front seats were also badly Knocked
out of shape.
When the collision came the motorman
was thrown heavily against the lever of
his braKe, but escaped without injury.
The conductor was standing between the
two seats on the rear platform, and was
forcibly propelled between the doorposts.
He also escaped injury.
Mrs. Helvogt made clear that she was
sitting on one of the back seats of the car
and was hurled against the rail when the
car struck the wagon. Her little daughter
escaped injury by being thrown against
the mother. Of tbe other passengers tbe
majority remained in the vicinity of the
accident for only a few minutes. There
were probably ten persons on the car.
Behlman and Duranthal claim to hare
heard only once the clang of the bell.
They remembered nothing after that but
a confused and indescribable sense of
being hauled through the air until they
recovered consciousness in the drugstore
of Dr. Artigues, situated on the corner,
where they were carried.
Immediately after the casualty the
wrecked wagon was cleared away and an
other car was coupled to the broken one,
which was taken to the carhouse for re
pairs.
Meeks says that he was the only eye
witness of the affair, and that no police
men appeared on the scene until one of
the bystanders blew a whistle. Officer
Hy man, it is understood, claims to have
seen tbe collision.
Meeks further states that when the offi
cers appeared he demanded that trie
motorman be arrested for violating the
law relating to the speed of streetcars,
but that no action was taken by these offi
cials. He stated, with much indignation,
last night that the motorman had been
transferred to car 1110 by the company,
and that so far as he knew there had been
no investigation of his conduct. He
threatens to swear out a warrant for the
motorman's arrest.

Speakers Assigned.
The Republican State Central Commit
tee has mapped out a vigorous plan of ac
tion for the remaining weeks of the cam
paign.
Next Thursday night at the Auditorium,
corner of Jones and Eddy streets, there
will be a mass-meeting under the manage
ment of the McKinley Invincibles, at
which Judge W. B. Heyburn of Idaho
and Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt will de
liver addresses. At this meeting a novel
feature of entertainment will be intro
duced. A quartet and chorus in full cos
tume will sing "The Tinker's Chorus"
from "Robin Hood." The singing at
these Auditorium meetings has become
quite an attraction, but on this occasion it
will surpass all others. Miss Ella Miller
spencer will sing campaign songs and
there will be several numbers by the favor
ite quartet.
Judge Heybnrn has been an occupant of
the Idaho bench for several years, and has
an enviable reputation as a speaker and

NOT SILVER BITTEN.
Socialists Expect No Relief From
Free Coinage.
Socialists have not been smitten with
the silver craze. They believe that un
limited silver in the treasury of Senator
Jones is not going to give labor to the un
employed nor wealth to the poverty
stricken.
Theodore Lynch, secretary of Liberty
Branch, Socialist Labor party, said to a
Call reporter yesterday :
"Socialists do not believe that the free
coinage of silver is the sine qua non of re
form, or that it will better the condition
of the wage-worker. The Socialist Labor
party is on this account different from
other political parties like the Populist,
which strives for and beiieves in a tem
porary palliative or in a modification of
the present system. Socialists stand not
only for the full demands of their plat
form, but for the overthrow of the present
industrial and economic wage system.
''We believe that the state should own
and control all the tools of production
and exchange; that there should be only
one monopoly, one trust, one syndicate,
and that should be the state.
"The free-coinage issue is a delusion,
because no workingman it poing to get
even silver without working for it. We
believe that the present competitive oys
tem must be altered and the co-operative
system substituted for it, and that it is
only by the adoption of the co-operative
commonwealth that the present social in
equalities can be removed."
YUBA ALL RIGHT.
A Live Business Man Tells Why
Protection Is Favored.
D. E. Knight of the Marysville Woolen
mills was in town yesterday and gave a
good account of political affairs in Yuba
County. Mr. Knight is an ardent protec
tionist. He would rather pay a duty on
foreign wool than to get foreign wool free
of duty and have to compete in a demor
alized market with the products of the
pauper labor of Europe.
Protection, by stimulating industry, en
ables the consumer to buy more and ex
tends the market. This means more of an
output by Mr. Knight's mills. He is wil
ling to have the mints go on aa they are
doing now, as long as his mills are pro
tected and kept running merrily all the
year round.
Mr. Knight said yesterday that he was
confident that Yuba County would give a
good majority for protection. 'Yuba is an
extensive fruit producing district, and
much of the product is dried and canned.
Hence the farmers of that section of
country want a high tariff on dried fruits.
They are willing also that other industries
should be protected in like manner and
are willing to pay a little more for a home
made cultivator or a pruning knife, if nec
Â«iÂ»ary, for when the home factories are
kept going the workmen will be able to
boy fruit from California.

POPULISTS KICKING HARD
Movement on Foot to Repudiate
the Legislative Fusion
Candidates.
Honest Populists Realizing That They
Have Been Sold to Democratic
Bosses.
Honest Populists are doing the high
kicking act, and their bosses are laughing
in their sleeves at them.
Cator, Buckley and Rainey have put
the party into their pockets, and have but
toned up their coats so that it can't es
cape.
C. P. Huntington is very much pleased
with the work of his lieutenants, who
have succeeded in bottling the anti
railroad sentiment for another four years.
The other corporations opposed to the
(jrovernmental ownership and control of
public utilities are equally as well satisfied
with the success of lusion brought about
by Cator and h>s Democratic allies, for it
has left them two enemies less to fight.
The honest Populists, the sturdy mid
dle-of-the-road men, are pleased also,
though for an opposite reason. What they
bad predicted when the silver czars cap
tured the People's Party Convention in*
St. Louis and frittered away the honest
Omaha platform, has come to pass, and
they are proclaimed true prophets. Fu
sion has placed Populism in the hands of
its enemies ana its destruction has been
wrought as surely as though it were a liv
ing being and the butcher's knife were at
its throat.
Populism had clean arguments till now.
Its leaders were believed to be honest and
its ranks were pure in heart, but the greed
in the breast of a political jobber for a pos
siole United States Senatorship, and the
hope in the bosom of another man, not
cunning enough to be a jobber, for an ex
pected collectorship of the port, have done
in California what the greed and treachery
of the Sockless Simpsons, the Sockful Al
iens and the Cyclone Davises have accom
plished in the Nation.
These honest Populists who had stood
aloof, bewildered and amazed, when the
garment of their principles was divided
among Buckley, Rainey, Huntington and
Cator; the farmer with sunburned cheeks
and freckled, calloused hands wondering
why he was always poor and why toe City
man who sold his produce could afford to
smoke fine cigars and drink the world's
best wines; the mechanic working on
half time or not working at all while the
roof over his head was growing a crop of
rent for the landlord, increasing day by
day â all these are begining to awake. The
spell of Svengali Stewart is broken. The
silver sheen on the desert has been reached
at last and found to be a path of white
alkali blazing in the sun and blistering
the hope of the thirsty traveler.
A revolution is impending, and Buckley
and Rainey and Cator and Huntington
will soon that the first trick in
euchre does not make the game.
The first movement of the revolt will be
the bolting of the Cator-Buckley-Rainey
legislative ticket in this City. Populists
are quietly talking among themselves and
are preparing to repudiate the whole legis
lative ticket from this City, with the ex
ception of P. L. Archibald and Calvin Ew
ing, candidates for State Senators, both of
whom are Populists.
They will also throw overboard the
municipal ticket, composed of Buckley
lambs, and will support only the few
Populists who were thrown into the
Buckley dough as People's party leaven,
but who were not sufficiently potent to
leaven the whole Buckley lump, the
aforesaid lump being composed of more
than ordinarily tough stuff.
At the bead and front of it all stands
Thomas V. Cator, who is a Cator man
first, last and all the time. With an un
scrupulousness worthy of a fat Caesar.
Cator has wrecked bis party in order tiiat
he may step upon its ruins into the beat
of a United States Senator.
Cator is modest, that is with a certain
kind of modesty. For instance:
i For United States Senator,
THOMAS V. CATOR,
: People's Party and Democratic :
Nominee.
The foregoing is his card in "The Pop
ulist" of this City. The announcement
that he is the nominee of the Democratic
party will be news to Democrats.
Populists of the First Congressional
District will not vote for young Fletcher
Cutler, the Democratic fusion candidate,
for whom Anti-Railroad Monteith was
thrown down by Mr. Huntington's orders.
Mr. Cutltr has met with a blacK frost
wherever he has appeared in the district.
At Sausalito and San Rafael recently he
had only .half a hall full of people, 'and
some of them guyed him.
Fletcher is a real cute speaker. He has
one speech, and it does not say anything
about the tariff or anything much about
the financial fad, but there is a whole lot
in it about the snow-clad peaks of the
grand old Sierras and the parched deserts
of Mojave. It happens that there are no
parched deserts in his district, so he has
to borrow a few from Mr. Bowers every
time he makes a speech.
His oratory is said to be burning â of the
"Boy Stood on the Burning Deck" style
There is also in it a pathetic strain of "the
"Woodman, Spare That Tree" order which
is considered very fetching indeed. That
is, it is fetching for everything except
votes.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 6, 1896.
FATHER YORKE'S
FINAL LECTURE
Concluding Address of the
Series Delivered Last
Night.
Review of the Local Political
Situation as Seen by the
Speaker.
MARSHALL'S DAMAGED MOUTH
Arguments of Dr. Case and Dr. Dille
Are Replied To by the
Chancellor.
Metropolitan Temple was last night
filled by a demonstrative audience that
gathered to hear Father Yorke deliver the
last of the series of lectures given under
the auspices of the American Women's
Liberal League. Julius Kahn presided
and prefaced the remarks of the speaker
of the evening by an address in which he
made a plea for freedom from religious
persecution and vigorously attacked the
A. P. A.
Father Yorke in his opening sentence
said that he felt that the effort of the
American Protective Association to secure
political control of the situation bad failed
and that the power of that organisation
was on the wane. He then proceeded to
answer the argument advanced a lew days
ago by the Rev. Dr. Case.
"Dr. Case," said the speaker, "declared
that Father Yorke is a smart man. I am
sorry I cannot return the compliment, for
it is a terrible thing to have to deal with
an adversary with the manners of a bear
and the intellect of a gander. In his
discussion of Catholic doctrines he
says he does not believe in purga
tory. He may go farther and fare
worse. What the doctor says about the
Y. M. I. being in politics is an old, worn
out gag. It is claimed that the existence
of the A. P. A. is due to the existence of
the Y. M. I. lam a member of the latter
organization, and if 1 thought that it
was mixed up in any kind of politics 1
would not stay in it for a minute. Where
there is no Y. M. I. is where the
A. P. A. flourishes. It is an association
of enthusiasts whose members are brave
when having to fight only women and
children. I tell you, no matter what Dr.
Case may say, the solution of this ques
tion is not the disbandment of any organ
ization, but it is to send forth to the peo
ple of this State the fact that there is a
God of justice, who executes his decrees
upon this earth, and that men of principle
are his ministers."
Father Yorke then turned his attention
to Dr. Dille. He referred sarcastically to
that gentleman's expressed surprise that
'the speaker should have mentioned a
number of persons as members of the A.
P. A. in connection with the political sit
uation. He said that Bishop Newman
bad issued an order for all his subordinates
to vote a certain ticket and said if asking
his hearers to vote for no man who has vio
lated the constitution was "being in
politics" he was in politics up to his neck.
"A secret society in politics is bound to
be corrupt," went on the speaker. "If it
was established by angels and run by
saints it might do some good, but being
carried on by men it cannot help turning
out a piece club and finally being sold out.
The idea of tbe A. P. A. is to hold tbe
balance of power by being able to
throw a large number of votes any
way it wants and so control all
partiej. To do this the voters must give
up their individuality and do as they are
told. The primary principle of the so
ciety is therefore boss rule. The draw
back to the whole thing, however, is the
liability to be sold out."
The attempt of H. N. F. Marshall to
blackmail John D. Spreckels was rehearsed
by Father Yorke, be claiming despite that
gentleman's denial that Mr. Spreckels
made a combination with the A. P. *A.
The Sacramento convention and the
local political fight also occupied a great
deal of the speaker's attention. He scored
tbe Civic Federation and wonnd up by an
appeal to those present to vote as he de
sired.
FATHER COYLE'S HOME,
He Sets the Pace in Enterprise
by Beautifying Rich
mond.
A General Atmosphere of Progress
add Prosperity Pervades the
Valley by the Sea..
Richmond, the ideal valley by the sea,
is a center of activity and progress.
The Rev. Father J. P. Coyle, pastor of
New Pastor's Residence for the Rev. Father Coyle in the Richmond
District.
the Roman Catholic church Star of the
Sea, has set the pace for future improve
ments in the lovely valley beyond the
cemeteries by starting the erection of a
handsome residence on Eighth avenue
adjoining his church.
The contract for the building has been
let to Contractor P. Mahoney of Oakland
for $6000.
The plans were drawn some time ago by
Architects Shea & Shea, and the brick
foundation has been laid by Matthew
Brady upon a substantial basis, sufficiently
strong to sustain a much larger building
than the twelve rooms now about to be
erected. But as Father Coyle said :
"We are not building this house for a
day or a year, but for at least a half of a
century, as by that time the Richmond
District will extend out to the ocean."
Evidently this prospective view is in his
mind, as he has recently bought two large
lots on Ninth avenue back of the church,
upon which he will erect a scboolhouse at
no distant day. Within the past three
years the population has increased three
fold.
This building, however, is not the only
one that is being erected in the Rich
mond district.
A. H. Forst is putting up a $4000 house
on Twentieth avenue, between Point
Lobos avenue and Clement street, upon a
55x120 foot lot.
' Francis Bracq is erecting a $3500 cottage
of six rooms on California street, between
Twelfth and Thirteenth avenues.
Mrs. Minnie Armstrong is expending
$3000 on the erection of a seven-room cot
tage on Twelfth avenue, between Clement
and California streets.
Samuel L. Thornton is about to build a
three-story house on Fourth avenue, be
tween Point Lobos avenue and A street,
at a cost of $3000.
Mrs. Anna F. Dixon will have a five
room cottage on Eleventh avenue, be
tween Lake and California streets, on
which she will spend $2500.
Robert Allen will invest $3000 in the
erection of a two-story house on fifteenth
avenue, between Clement and California
streets.
T. H. Parker, a real-estate agent in the
Richmond district, has had an offer for a
fifty-vara lot alongside the Maria Kip Or
phanage at an advance far above the price
heretofore asked for similar property in
the district, but the owner declined, al
leging that the lot will be worth twice as
much within a few years.
The Southern Pacific has at last awak
ened to the numerous protests made by tlae
people whose property fronts on Point
Lobos avenue, and has set a gang of men
to work removing the old unused street
railroad tract from that thoroughfare.
Fifth avenue, between Lake and Cali
fornia streets, has been graded and mac
adamized by Greely & Kenny.
A sewer has been put down on Twelfth
avenue, between Point Lobos avenue and
A street, by the same contractors.
A street, between Sixth and Seventh
avenues, has been graded, sewered and
macadamized by Contractors Sharon &
Mc,Hugh. This is the section adjacent to
where the blind sewer is permitted to.
stand in consequence of the obstinacy of
the directors of the French Hospital, who
alone hold out against the improvement
and the necessity of continuing the sewer
alongside of their property from A street
to Point Lobos avenue on Sixth avenue.
The heirs of the Hamilton estate have
come into the line pf progress and signed
their consent to permit Felix McHugh to
put the sewer in, but the French Hospital
property remains impassive to the re
quests of the other property-owners and
the management declines to sign the con
tract by which the sanitary condition of
the hospital would be improved . Twenty
first avenue, between Clement and Cali
fornia, has been graded and sewered. In
addition to all this notable improvement
the old Bay District racecourse has been
tilled in and is now one plateau of white
sand. The only landmark by which the
old familiar aite can be recognized is the
grand-stand building.
REVISION OF LABOR LAWS
Convention to Consider the
Matter Called for Next
Sunday.
Delegates Invited From Ail the Trade
and Labor Organizations of
the City.
Great interest is being manifested by
the various labor organizations in tbe con
vention called for next Sunday to take ac
tion regarding labor laws to be amended
or introduced during the coming session
of the Legislature. The call for the con
vention was issued by the District Council
of the Carpenters and Joiners of Ameiica,
and was sent out on Saturday by Secretary
R. B. Ingle. It reads as follows:
1 1 At a regular meeting of the District Council
of Carpenters and Joiners of America, held :
Wednesday evening, September 30, I was in
structed to issue an Invitation to hII trade and
labor organizations of the City and County of
Han Francisco to participate in a labor con
vention to be held for the purpose of propos
ing and amending: labor laws, such as eijtht
hour laws, lien laws, life and limb laws, etc.;
also 10 take up the labor laws proposed by the
State Labor Commissioner and make "such
recommendation or amendments to the same
aa will be beneficial to the working classes.
The convention will be held Sunday, October
11, at 10 o'clock a. it.; at the halls of the
Labor Bureau Association, 915% Market
street. We ask your organization to appoint
three delegates to be furnished with the
proper credentials. Don't fail to respond, as
this is a matter of vital importance to all con
cerned.
In accordance with this invitation Car
penters' Union No. 483 last night at its
session at thÂ« Labor Bureau Association
rooms appointed the following three
delegates to the convention: C.Buckley,
G. Lathrop and J. McCartney.
THE ASSISTANTS
OF SAM RAINEY
Citizens Generally So Re
gard the Little Non-
Partisan Crowd.
The Ticket Would Give the
Local Government Wholly to
the Democracy.
HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW PHELAN.
Alleged Non-Partisans Dipped Into
Partisan Politics on the Leg
islative Tick ' t.
The Non-Partisan ticket is now a thing
of three campaigns in San Francisco.
The movement started out well some
years ago, deserving of the respect of
all good citizens. Then it fell into
the hands of Dan Burns when he
"had reason to war on other bosses, then it
petered out to an "indorsement" of par
tisan candidates, and this year
it has become a little, boss
ridden movement controlled by
three or four or more men with friends,
ideas and some force, and backed by fifty
complaisant citizens of good intentions,
considerable innocence, much faith and
little political wisdom. '
A consensus of the impressions and
the decided opinions of the best
citizens representing all parties
is easily obtained by any observant
man interested in the welfare of the com
munity who converses much with people
on the streetcars, on the sidewalks and in
the haunts of business.
It is easily discovered about town that
the Non- Partisan ticket of this campaign
is an ignoble thing, which is drawing
small respect and support to its side.
A small handful of men representing no
constituency but their political friends
and their prejudices met in formal con
vention for several nights and ratified the
judgments of three or four men whose
leadership seemed to be conceded, as lead
ership is always conceded when men come
together.
Now intelligent citizens are sizing up
the work of the Non- Partisan "conven
tion," the "convention" being a small
self-appointed body created hastily amid
the wreck of the Non-Partisan campaign
of two years a^o.
It is being privately said by the real
Non-Partisans of the City, including many
of the sincere men who went heartily into
the movement a few years ago, when it
seemed to promise something good, that the
Non-Partisan convention of this year ap
pears to have been a small handful of
pretty good people who were used as tools
by unscrupulous politicians wherever the
leaders of the movement had no friends
or policies of their own to stand by.
It is oeing universally observed that the
Non-Partisan ticket, if successful, would,
in the event of the success of the new
charter, throw the entire City govern
ment, with its patronage and election ma
chinery, into the hands of the Demo
crats.
While Georg6 K. Fitch acted as chair
man of the formal meetings, it is well
known that the powers which controlled
tbe action of the convention were mainly
Frank J. Sullivan, Jeremiah Lynch and
L. R. Ellert.
The main thing to be gained was the
City government, for the Non-Partisan
convention supported the charter and
gambled on its success. It was Frank
J. Sullivan's first care to capture the
nomination for Mayor for his brother-in
law James D. Phelan. If Mr. Phelan were
Mayor under the new charter an immense
amount of patronage would be at his dis
posal.
Democratic bosses pulled the strings of
the convention so successfully that the
Democracy captured everything worth
having in the municipal indorsements,
which are seen to be as follows :
Mayor, James D. Phelan; Auditor, William
Broderick Tax Collector, W. N. Block; Re
corder, T; J. Glynn; City and County Attor
ney, H.. T. Creswell;' Administrator, A. C.
FreÂ«se; Stieritt', R. L Whelan; County Clerk
M. C. Haley.
It was a clean sweep of the municipal
offices the Democratic wire-pullers effected
in that Non- Partisan convention.
It is the action of the Non-Partisan
Convention in nominating a complete
legislative ticket that has best displayed
the spirit of tbe combination and most
disgusted the voters who look for what in
politics has the qualities of cleanness and
good sense.
Citizens who might have gained confi
dence in the "Non-Partisan" judgment of
party candidates are unable to see why a
Non-Parli.-an body should thrust itself into
National politics if it wishea to be true to
its avowed purposes and principles. The
legislative campaign of this year in
California involves the election of
a United States Senator and in
other ways than this the ballots cast this
year for Assemblymen and Senators rn
volve the wishes of the voters on the
highest National issues that are presented
to them.
This effort of the little Non-Partisan
bosses to take a hand in the vital is
sues of party politics has especially dis
gusted a majority of the voters to
whom the Non-Partisans expect to
appeal. Many members of the Non-Parti
san Convention repudiated this action and
are not backward about denouncing it
now.
One of them is Julius Kahn, who is In
tensely disgusted, but who talks very con
servatively for publication.
"I was opposed to the convention tak
ing any hand in the legislative fight,"
said Mr. Kahn last night, "and I
am opposed to it now. The election
of a United States Senator is one
of the things involved in the legislative
issues, and as that is properly a held for
party politics Ido not think that a Non-
Partisan convention should go out of its
municipal field to enter it."
But the political pulls which controlled
the Non-Partisan Convention were too
strong to stop with a plan for the capture
of the municipal eovernment. Some
chances to exercise pulls in the coming
Legislature were wanted as well.

as positive cures without avail, have come
to the â  conclusion that there is no cure
for this- most distressing disease, and
these, same persons will De the more in
doubt and f . skeptical when they learn
through the columns of the press that Dr.
Rudolph Schiffmann, the recognized- au-
thority who has : treated 'i more cases of
these diseases than any living doctor, has
achieved success iby perfectine a remedy
which not only gives immediate ;â¢ relief : in
the worst cases, but has - positively cured
thousands of sufferers â â  who were consid-
ered incurable. These were just as skep-
tical as some of our readers now are.
Dr. Schiffmann's remedy no doubt pos-
sesses the merit which is claimed for it or
he would not authorize this paper to an-
nounce that he is not only willing to give
free to each person suffering from asthma,
hay fever ; or ; bronchitis in this city one
liberal ; "free trial box" of his Cure, but ur-
gently requests all sufferers to call at Will-
iam J. Bryan's drugstore, under Grand Ho-
tel, from 8 a. m. till 6 p. m. Thursday, Oct.
Bth, and receive a package absolutely free
of charge, knowing f that , in making the
claim he does for his Cure a strong doubt
may arise in the minds of many, ai:ci that
a personal test, as ' he offers to ali;?wiJl be
more convincing/ and prove ' its met.'ts,
than the publishing of thousands of testi-
monials from persons who huTC'been per-
manently cured by the use of : his Asthma
Cure. , "Dr. Schiffmann's Asthma Cure,"
as it is called, has-been sold by druggists
of this City ever since it was first intro-
duced, although many persons may never
have heard of, it, and ft is with a view to
reaching these that he makes this offer.
This is certainly a most generous and fair
offer, and all who are suffering from any
of the above complaints should remember
the date and : place where the distribution
will be made and avail themselves of the
same. Persons "living out of ' this City

AT THE PRESIDIO
Nuptials of Miss Jennie
Catherwood and Dr.
Grinnell.
Assembly Hall Adorned With
Pennants and Snowy
Blossoms.
THE PEESIDIO BAND PLAYS.
Most Elaborate Affair Ever Witnessed
at the Postâ Gorgeous Wed
ding Presents.
Miss Jennie Catherwood (daughter of \
Mrs. Major DarJing) and Dr. Morton
Grinnell, a prominent society and clnb
man of New York, were married yesterday
morning at half-past 10 in the Assembly
Hail at the Presidio.
If there is any truth in the old adage,
"Happy is the bride the sun-shines on,"
sureJy Dr. Grinnell's fair young bride has
before her a future of unalloyed happi
ness.
Oid Sol pourea forth his warmest and
brightest rays and his genial Bmile was
reflected by the many guests assem
bled to do the young couple honor.
Nothing that might add to the imposing
and magnificent effect of the affair had
been omitted. Assembly Hall by the aid
of pennants and snowy blossoms was
transformed into a veritable bower of
beauty. No bizarre effects had been aimed
at in the adornment of the ball. Cordons
of smilax fell in graceful loops from chan
deiier to chandelier and draped the walls,
caught up at intervals with bunches of
long-stemmed white crysanthemums.
There were flags everywhere. They
formed the background of the improvised
altar and a glorious arched canopy over
head the entire length of the hall. The
ensemble formed a stirring picture, as ef
fective as it was beautiful.
At 10:30 o'clock, to the strains of the
Presidio band playing the Norwegian wed
ding march, the bridal party entered the
ball and proceeded down the center aisle
to the improvised altar. First came the
Uihers. Walter Dean, Callaghan Byrne,
Harry Pringle, George Lough borough, Mr.
Frazier and Seranus Hastings.
Following the ushers walked the brides
maids, Miss BÂ»e Hooper, Miss Marjnrie
Young, Miss Alice Rutherford, Miss Mary
Kip and Miss Emma Spreckels.
Preceding the bride, who entered on the
arm of Thomas Madden, an old friend of
the family, came the maid of honor, Miss
Azalea Keyes. Little Ethel Hastings and
Master Hoyt Hastings closed the bridal
procession.
The groom and his best man, William
Milm Grinnell, met the bride at the altar,
where Father Prelato, the white-haired
priest of the Presidio, read the solemn
words that made the couple man and wife.
During the ceremony the Presidio band j
vlayed softly Major Darling's beautiful
composition, "Blessed Dreams."
After the ceremony the newly wedded
couple took up their station in a dainty
and artistically decorated alcove of the
hail, wnere their friends gathered round
them and offered their congratulations.
Later a wedding breakfast was served
and the following excellent menu prepared
by a caterer was discussed:
California Oysters, half-shell, on ice.
Consomme en tasse. Tim bai of Chicken.
Artichoke Forids with Sweetbreads,
Sauce Bernais.
Terrapin cla Maryland. Cremme de Mentne Punch
tqnabs on Toast, fresh Mushroom Sauce.

DESSEHT.
Marron Icecream In cases.
Assorted Cakes. Sorris Cakes. Marron Glace.
.Strawberry Glace.
Almonds. Pecans. Fancy Candies.
Weeding Cake In boxes. Bridal Cake.
Cafe.
The bride's table was handsomely
decorated with chryanthemums and vio
lets. In the center of the table was a
bank of snowy white chrysanthemums,
while scattered in artistic oonfusion about
the board were Bride's roses and Russian
violets. Seated at the bride's table were
the members of the bridal party, and at
the second large table the following most
intimate friends of the bride:
Miss Bessie Zanc, Miss Clementine Kip,
Mies Ethel Hooper, Miss Lillian Young, Miss
Grace Geiselmau, Miss Lizzie Carroll, Miss
Jennie Blair, Miss Morris; Lieutenant Hahn,
U.S.A.; Lieutenant Winston, U. 8. A.; Lieu
tenant Gateley, U. 8. A.; Lieutenant Burgess,
U.S. A.; Dr. Edee, U. fc. A., and Lieutenant
White, U.S. A.
The rest of the guests were seated at
tete-a-tete tables.
The gowns of the bridal party, which
were most beautiful and elaborate, have
already been minutely described in these
columns.
Dr. Grinnell and bis best man were
attired in what must be the latest and
most approved of New York fashion.
They wore the usual frock and gray
trousers with a shirt of a delicate pink
hue and white collar and white tie. In
their buttonhole was a huge white
chrysanthemum.
At 3 o'clocK Mrs. Grinnell changed her
-. elaborate bridal outfit for a natty tan
* tailor gown, and amid a shower of rice
Dr. Grincell and bis young bride were
whirled away. The honeymoon is to be
spent at Madrone Villa, Napa County.
The bridal presents were unusually
numerous and gorgeous in the extreme.
There was crystal galore,Â«exquisite silver
and gold ornaments studded with
precious stones.
Mrs. Huntington sent a magnificent
diamond sunburst, the stones of unusual
size and purity.
Mrs. Stanford's gift to her namesake
was a set of seven exquisite pieces of
silver, a fruitdish, two cake plates and
four bonbonieres. The pieces were of un
usually handsome design of silver lace
work, now so fashionable.
Mrs. Alice Rutherford presented the
bride with a gold mesh purse, on the
square gold lid of "which was set an
immense amethyst.
Mr. Fred Webster sent a crystal decan
ter with gold rim, studded with ame
thysts.
Mrs. S. M. Wilson's gift was a ruby glass
and silver vase.
Mrs. Henry Crocker's present was an
exquisite vase of Tiffany glass.
Mrs. Irvine and Callaghan Byrne sent
a pair of elegant bronzes.
Miss Alice Boggs' gift was a Sevres vase.
Mrs. Peter Donahue and Mrs. Martin
sent a crystal and silver salad set.
Mrs. Clans Spreckeis presented the bride
with some exquisite silver.
A un.que present was the gift of Miss
Lillian Young. It was a belt made of the
ekin of a rattlesnake thai had been killed
by Colonel Young.
Mrs. Colonel J. D. Fry sent a historical
; point-lace handkerchief.
\ Thomas Maddens gift was a butterfly
trooch of diamonds, sapphires and rubies.
Mrs. La Montague, sister of the bride,
sent a sapphire and diamond heart.
Major Darling presented his step-daugh
ter with an elegant piece of bronze.
There were many other gifts all equally
beautiful and costly.

INCIDENT FOR GOSSIP.
Policemen Detailed for the Wedding
Ordered Away From the Reser
vation by General Graham,
One incident occurred which did not
mar the wedding, but excited some gossip
at the military post. Shortly after the
guests began to assemble Captain Elbridge
R. Hills, officer of the day, observed Po
lice Sergeant Martin, a3 hack inspector,
and three policemen performing duty on
the reservation. He reported the facts to
General Graham, commanding the post,
and inquired if the police were there by
his direction. General Graham replied
that he bad not made a request for poiice-
I men, and therefore directed the officer of
the day to inform the police officers that
their services were not required and re
quest them to leave tlie reservation. Cap-
I tain Hills was admonished to convey tne
\ request gently by simply informing the
] police that it was not proper for them to !
\be there. This course was deemed advi=a- 1
ble, as the relations between the police de- j
partment ana the military authorities j
have always been pleasant. On receipt of â 
the order Sergeant Martin withdrew his '
men.
Immediately after the police were re
lieved from duty. General Graham ad
dressed a written communication to Major
i John A. Darling, Fifth Artillery, inquiring j
if the major bad requested the detail of ,
police, for duty on the premises. Major ;
' Darling replied, stating that the request i
} for policemen had not been m-ade by Him,
; but by somebody else. This closed the
! police incident at" the Presidio.
Among civilians the opinion was ex-
I pressed that General Graham went fur
, tner than the circumstances warranted, in
thus requesting tue policemen to with
draw. It was held that their presence to
keep hackmen in order and prevent con
fusion in the carriage line constituted no
reflection on the ability of soldiers to pre
serve order.
Military men, however, regard the detail
of police for duty at an army post as
wholly unnecessary, and hold that the
post commander was right in sending
away the policemen.
HIS CHECKS WORTHLESS.
N. B. Chevallier Is Wanted by
Several Confiding Busi
ness Men.
A Mythical Bank Account That
Nevertheless Brought a Drum
mer Funds.
The police and quite a number of con
fiding business men would like very much
to know the present whereabouts of N. JbS.
Cbevallier, who lor some time past has
followed the occupation of a druraiaer for
liquor-houses in the City.
Some of the acquaintances he made
while acting in this capacity are exhibit
ing checks on which they advanced him
coin in various amounts and which turned
out to be utterly useless.
On September 30 Cbevallier called on
Kutchmeister & Hoffman of Stockton
street and asked a member of the firm to
advance him $6 50 on a cbecK for $10.
promising to return the next day and get
the balance of the money, when the check
should ba cashed by the Tallant Banking
Company, on which it was drawn. As
Cbevallier had been known to the firm for
some time the money was advanced with
out qu( stion.
When payment was demanded at the
bank it was found that Chevallier or the
firm whose name was signed to the check
bad no funds there, and it also developed
that no less than four similar checks had
been presented for payment.
The name of M. Augenblick, a Market
street liquor-dealer, is signed to most of
tue checks, which are mainly for small
amounts.
Chevallier formerly worked for Hall,
Meyer & Co. It is believed that be has
left the City.
After the Fire.
A new mud bath building has arisen in place
of the one recently burned at Paso Robles. The
new building is more modern and more con
venient, and the mud is much easier of access.
Reduced rates for winter, $10, $12 and $15,
now prevail. The mild, even winter climate
of this resort is much sought after by invalids*

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 6, 1896.
BEAUTY WEDS
WITH WEALTH
Marriage of William L.
Gerstle and Miss Sadie
Hecht.
A Ceremony That Is Character
iz d by the Utmost
Simplicity.
NO BRIDAL ATTENDANTS.
The Happy Ycuug Couple Evade a
Shower of Rice and Board a
Car for the Ferry.
Miss Sadie Hecht and William L.
Geratle were married yesterday afternoon
at balf^past 2 o'clock at the. residence of
the bride's parents; Colonel and Mrs. M.
H. Hecht, on Washington street.
Rev. Dr. Voorsanger performed thecere
monv, which was characterized by the
utmost simplicity.
The bride is a handsome and highly ac
complished young lady, and most popular
in the exclusive set of which she is a shin
ing light.
Mr. Gerstle is the son of Lewis Gerstle,
the millionaire merchant, and is prom
inently associated with his father and
*uncle, Louis Sloss, in the management of
I the Alaska Commercial Company.
Only the immediate relatives of the con-
I tracting parties were present at the cere-
I mony, but at the reception which followed
about seventy-five of the most intimate
friends offered their congratulations to the
young couple.
Hop blossoms and autumn leaves helped
I to give a festive appearance to the elegant
! interior ot the Hecht residence. In the
drawing-room, where the ceremony was
performed, wreaths of pink chrysanthe
mums were used with artistic effect
The bride was attired in a beautiful
toilette of white satin and tulle. The
bridal veil was confined to the coiffure by
a diamond sunburst, the gift of the
groom.
Mrs. Hecht, the mother of the bride,
wore an elaborate gown of lavender
brocade.
Mrs. Marcus Gerstle, the bride's sister,
was attired in a costume ot white moire
and velvet. The jupe was of silk, and
with it was worn an open front black
velvet jacket and a jabot of. white point.
Miss Grace Hecht looked charming in a
dainty gowi> of white satin and chiffon,
and Miss Rosebud Hecht was attired in
pink satin and chiffon.
At the reception an elaborate menu was
served Rt tete-a-tete tables. To Miss Belle
O'Connor fell the ring concealed in the
bridal cake.
As the hour for the young couple's de
parture drew near their young friends
prepared to shower them with rice and
decorate their carriage with wedding
favors.
But, in the parlance of the day, the
young people got left.
Mr. and Mrs. Gerstle came smilingly
and serenely out by a side door, and hop
ping aboard a passing cable-car, rodeaown
to the ferry.
They left last evening for a three
months' bridal tour throughout the East
ern States.
IT WAS ALCOHOLISM.
Result of the Autopsy on the Body of
Mi'H. Alary Anderson.
Dr. Morgan yesterday performed an
autopsy on the body of Mrs. Mary Ander
son, 419 Harriet street, who died at the
City Prison Sunday night under circum
stances so peculiar as to warrant the sus
picion that death resulted from poison.
It was found, however, that ahe died from
excessive drink, though the stomach will
be subjected to chemical analysis.
When Chief Crowley was notified of the '
result of the autopsy he gave orders that
the woman's husband, Andrew Anderson,
ahould be released from custody. Ander
son was arrested by Policemen Ryan and
ODea, as some of the neighbors had been
talking about the woman being poisoned
and an empty box marked "Rough
on Rats" had been found in the yard.
The result of the autopsy also bears out
the diagnosis of the case made by Dr.
Fitzgibbons when the woman was taken
to the Receivine Hospital. The doctor
came to the conclusion that she was suf
fering from nothing but alcoholism out
side of the wound in her face made by the
glass thrown at her by her husband.
"The publication of the statements,"
said Dr. Fitzgibbon yesterday, "that Po
liceman Eslrew told me the woman had
taken poison and that I di'l not examine
her for traces of poison has placed me in
an embarrassing position.
"Policeman Eskewdid not tell me that
the woman had taken poison, but merely
said she hnd taken 'something.' That
'something' I concluded was nothing but
jiquor. I asked the woman if she had
tauen poison and she positively denied it,
so after dressing her wound 1 sent her to
the City Prison. "
SUICIDE OF AN OLD MAN.
C. Roed Takes Hig Life by Inhaling
Illuminating GaÂ«>
C. Reed, 70 years cf age, whose occupa
tion is unknown, committed suicide in his
room, 715 Howard street, by inhaling il
luminating gas yesterday afternoon.
The old man rented the room in which
he took his life last Friday evening. He
appeared to have but little money, but
nevertheless he seldom spoke to those
with whom he came in contact regaraing
his misfortunes.
He returned to his room early yesterday
morning and it was thought he retired.
As C. Boesmarfn, proprietor of the house,
was passing Reed's room late in the after
noon he detected tbe odor of gas evidently
coming from his lodger's room. He
knocked at the door, but on receiving no
response burst in the door and found that
the old man was dead. The body was on
the bed and a rubber tube attached to a
easjet, from which a full stream of gas
was flowing, was near at hand, showing
that death had resulted from intentional
asphyxiation. The body was removed to
the Morgue.

DIVINE HEALER
HAS LEFT TOWN
The People Read * The Call"
and Lost Faith iD
Him.
He Read " The Call" and Took
an Early Train South*
ward.
BUT SAYS HE WILL KETURN.
Heard of Schlatter's Success and at
Once Bought Himself a Crucifix
and a Black Robe.
The alleged "Divine Healer" Schrader
left by the early morning train yesterday
for San Jose. His departure was so sud
den that bis manager was left in this
City.
As to the cause of the sudden departure
no one about the International Hotel,
where he had beeu stopping, professed to
know anything. There were very few in
quiries at the hotel concerning him con
sidering the great numbers who had beea
waiting upon him for a blessin?. It is al
together likely that Thb Call's exposure
of the man was responsible for both of
these circumstances â the turning away of
the public and the departure from the
City of the biack-robed mystic.
Schrader was prepared to go to any
length that the simplicity and credulity of
the people of this City would permit.
And certainly the throngs who waited
upon him, begged his blessing, even kneel
ing before him, seemed to warrant him in
attempting any extreme.
For instance, as one. of the properties
of his show he carried a photograph of a
stout old lady, a very comfortable looking
housewife, whom he claimed was his
mother.
'â¢Wherever I show this photograph," he
said in an interview with a Call man Sat
urday evenine, "the most intelligent peo
ple immediately proclaim it to be the pic
ture of another Virgin Mary" â this with
out a smile.
"My methods like those of Schlatter?"
he went on in answer to the inquiry. "Oh,
no. Schlatter would consume half an
hour in treating one person. If I only
touch the flesh it is as good as though I
spent half an hour over it. Schlatter
couldn't treat more than forty persons a
day, and ttien he would be very busy,
while I have handled 7000 people. Be
sides, Sclilatter would take the handker
chief in one hand to bless it, while I take
it with both hands, you notice.
This is the sort of talk with which the
"divine healer" entertains those who see
him in private. He laughs, too, over the
people who come to see him for a blessing.
"Of course there are many who come to
see me out of mere curiosity just to say

The following is from a Congregational
minister of Riverside, who claims^oknow
Schrader and to know the "divine healer."
Dear Editor: Your issue of October 1 con
tains a portrait of August Scrader, "divine
healer," and a brief account of him. I can
supply a few particulars. Mr. Shrader made
his appearance in<Northern Illinois two years
ago. He claimed to be pastor of a small Ger
man Congregational church in Wisconsin and
said that his church and home had been
burned up in the fires that raged there through
the summer. He lost his sick sister in the
flames and only saved himself by standing up
to his neck in a small lake. He carried a let
ter in support of his claims, â¢with the name of
Rev. Thomas Grassie, superintendent of Con
gregational Missions for Wisconsin, attached
to it. He gained through that letter the sym
pathy and help of many ministers in Illinois.
He was introduced to churches, graphically
described his experiences in the great flres
and received liberal donations, which ho said
ho intended to spend in securing an educa
tion. I hold his receipt for $15, paid to him
by the congregation in Illinois of which I was
at that time pastor.
It was soon discovered that his letter bear
ing the name of Mr. Grassie was a forgery, and
that he, though but a young man, was an old
impostor. Soon after this he got into some
difficulty with the police in the most dis
reputable part of Chicago. He then was lost

sight of for a time. Last winter the public
interest that attached to the work of Schlatte r
of Denver called out a number of would-be
"Divine heaiers." August Shrader appeared
in that role in Southern Illinois. HÂ« made
extravagant pretensions, wore a robe, trimmed
his hair and whiskers as much as possible like
the Chrlsi as represented in art, and had a
manager. He operated in Lincoln, Spring
field and other places in Illinois. Soon his
former victims wero on his track and his
record was furnished to the police and tbe
press. Then he went to Ohio and the last I
heard of him before I came to the coast he was
in Cincinnati.
A week ago he was in Los Angelee, but one
of the papers of that city made it so not for
him that he hastily left. 1 put you in posses
sion of these facts that you may not allow a
suffering public to be imposed upon. Cor-
Qlally, yours, â  Edward F. Goff.

SAN JOSE, Cal., Oct. s.â Schrader, the
"divine healer," arrived in this city this
morning. He stated that his visit was for
the purpose of blessing a Mr. Miller, who
is afflicted with spinal trouble. He at

along the street in his long black gown
and regalia. Quite a nnmber visited him

MISS DALY'S BENEFIT
A Local Favorite Who Will Be
Launched by Friends on
Thursday.
Miss Anna Daly, the fair and favorite
local actress, will be tendered a farewell
testimonial on Thursday evening at Na
tive Sons' Hall, 414 Mason street. Miss
Daly has already won many laurels on
the stage, having played with the Rose
Coghlan Company in "Carmen," when
she sustained the role of Mercedes with
great credit. She is well and favorably
known in social and dramatic circles in
this City. She hopes to join the Rose
Coghian Company on November 1 in New
York, whence they will tour through the
Soutri. Miss Daly's many friends antici
pate a large attendance on Thursday
evening perhaps the last opportunity for
some time .for hearing this talented per
former. This young lady will on this oc
casion appear in a sparkling one-act
drama in a role which is peculiarly
adapted to her clever style of acting.
TO IMPROVE POLK STREET
The Executive Committee of the
Club to Increase
Trade.
Merchants Who Want the Street
Open From Market to North
Point Street.
L. H. Kobn, president of the Polk
street Improvement Club, has named the
following as the executive committee of
the club:
Nathan Bibo of California and Polk
streets, John E. Quinn of Pine and Polk
streets, E. Bernheim of 1151 Polk street,
J. A. O'Day of 1526 Polk street, Martin
Hink of Vallejo and Polk streets, A. Far
ran of 1755 Polk street and Valentine
Schmidt of Jackson and Polk streets. Mr.
Bibo is the chairman of the committee.
"It is the purpose of our club," said
.President Kohn, "to make Polk street the
business street of the district. We intend,
as we decided at the meeting last Tuesday,
to illuminate the street with arc lights
from Sutter to Pacific avenue, and thia will
be done probably about the end of this
month. That matter is now in the hands
of Messrs. Quinn and Schmidt. Then we
propose to induce all the merchants on the
street tomake their places of business as
attractive as possible; that is, we will re
quest that they do and that they keep open
until a stated hour every weekday night.
Then we shall seek to have the street put
in first-class condition, and we will use
our best endeavors to have the street cut
through from Greenwich to Lombard,
which is now obstructed by a high em
bankment.
"If we succeed in having that removed
we will have an open thoroughfare from
Market to North Point street, the northern
terminus of which will be one block from
Fort Mason at Point San Jose.
"We propose to make oar places of busi
ness attractive and offer inducements, so
that we may compete with downtown
stores and retain the trade which naturally
belongs to tbia district. In brief, our aim
is to put life into the street.
"We have in contemplation a number
of things of which it would not be politic
to speak now, but they are such as will be
of benefit to the people of this section.
"Our club now numbers 150 members,
all, except twenty-three who are property
owners, being merchants and store
keepers. Our executive committee has
had ono session, at which a number of
matters were discussed, and it will report
at the meeting to be held next Tuesday
evening."

PORTUGUESE IN
FRIENDLY RIVALRY
Preparing for Their Union
Grand Council at
Pleasanton.
The Progressive Town Is in Gala
Attire and Astir With
Hospitality.
CANDIDATES FOR THE OFFICES
It Is Thought Probable That This Will
Be the Liveliest Session in the
Order's History.
PLEASANTON. Cal., Oct. s.â This little
town is bustling with excitement to-night.
The tenth session of the Grand Council of
the Portuguese Union will be called to
order to-morrow at 10 a. m. Most of the
delegates arrived to-night and were re
ceived by J. P. Rosa, F. Caetano and, J.
V. Pereira at the depot and assigned to
headquarters. Druids' Hall is elaborately
decorated and citizens are vicing with
each other to hospitably entertain the
Officers of the Portuguese Union Grand Council.
delegates. Besides the session of the
union, the time to-morrow will be de
voted to the reception of delegates, and
in the evening to social festivities in Rose
Hall. The details of the programme are
well in hand and a busy week is contem
plated. Tbe houses and stores, in a spirit
of iriendly rivalry, have unique decora
tions md each is striving to outdo its
neighbor.
The annual report of the grand secre
tary, Louis Martin, will show the union
in a flourishing condition. A synopsis of
his report follows:
Balance on haud July 31, 1895. $9,746 81
Received from all sources since October
1. 1895 32,601 65
Total disbursements, 1896 35,734 30
Number ot member* in 1895 1,489
Initialed since 2b6 !
Beadmiued 12 j
Number of deaths during year 14 ]
Number suspended 86
Number expelled 1 I
Withdrawn 1 I
Totai loss during year 10- |
Present membership 1,685 I
Total gain during past year. 196 !
The committee anpointed at (he last
Grand Council, held at Sacramento, to re
vis? the constitution will have many
amenaments for the union to take action
on, and it is probable that the session will
last three lull days, with evening meet
ings. The union has paid for deaths of
its members and their wives, since its or
ganization in 1880, a total of $153,882. At
the present session an effort will be made
to increase the salary of the grand secre
tary from $350 to $600. A beautiful badge,
emblematic oi the order and cos tine; $75,
will be presented to John Mattos, the re
tiring grand president.
The principal proposed amendment to
the constitution will be the creating of
three policies of $1400, $700 and $350, re
spectively. Tne assessments shall hence
forth be monthly and fixed at $2, $1 and
50 cents, respectively. The object is to
give everybody a chance to join the
society. The initiation fee shall be con
siderably reduced. The number of direct
ors shall be raised to seven. The duties
â¢f secretary, heretofore performed by one
officer, will hereaiter be periormed by two,
called, respectively, financial aud record
ing secretary. The _rand officers shall be,
therefore, grand president, grand vice
president, granu recording secretary, grand
financial secretary, grand treasurer, seven
grand directors and a grand medical ex
aminer. The following offices that were
heretofore elective snail hereafter be ap
pointed by the grand preaident: Inside
guard, masterof ceremonies and marshal.
Wednesday wiil be devoted to the ses
sion in the morning and a drive through
the surrounding country in the afternoon.
At night a banquet will be served at Rose
Hotel.
There is a spirit of friendly rivalry for
the grand offices. Frank I. Lemos, the
well-known attorney at Haywards, and
who has great executive abi.ity, will un
doubtedly be promoted to president,
but he nas three formidable opponents in
Messrs. Cunha and Fonte of Oakland,
and probably the incumbent, John G.
Mattos of Centerville; for vice-Dresident,
M. T. Freitas of Hollister and A. A. Sar
mento of East Oakland; for grand finan
cial secretary, L. J. Martin of San Lean
dro; for grand recording secretary, M. B.
de (Jamara of San Francisco, whose abil
ity for the secretaryship is acknowledged
by all delegates at the session and who de
serves recognition for the work he has
done in ihe past for the organization, will
undoubtedly be elected; for treasurer, A.
Lucio, and for grand medical examiner,
LÂ»rs. A. J. Dean, the incumbent, J. G. Bet
tencourt of San Francisco and Alvures
Cabral of Oakland will seek th* honor,
with chances in favor of Dr. A. J. Dean.
Many other candidates for grand officers
will announce themselves to-morrow., and
it is probable that this will be the liveliest
session in tbe history oi tbe order.

CHURCH AND CHICKENS.
How an Episcopalian Mission at Ocean
View Was Started.
St. Luke's Episcopal Church on Van
Ness avenue has adopted the Episcopalian
mibsion at Ocean View as its own. For
some time past a lay reader from tee
Divinity School at San Mateo held
services at Ocean View in a little hall,
wnich was jocularly alluded to as the
chiefcen-house, as it is stated that the
building was once used for that purpose.
In spite of its not being in a fine location,
nowever, the mission has crown, and now
nulnbersover twenty communicants and
has forty children in its Sunday-school.
Services are conducted at present by
Rev. William C. Shaw, curate of St.
Luke's, in the little hall which was once
used as a chicken- house. Lay readers
from San Mateo also assist. This home
of the mission will soon become a thing of
the past, however, as a fine lot in the
center of Ocean View has been donated.
It is intended soon to erect a $700 church,
and $300 has already been collected
toward the buildine fund. Rev. Mr.
Moreland, rector of St. Luke's, stated yes
terday that the building would probably
be commenced in two or three months.
WOMAN'S NEW FRIEND.
The Jewish Time* and ObserTer to
Favor Kqual Suffrage.
Among yesterday's visitors at the
Woman Suffrage Bureau were the Rev.
Dr. M. 8. Levy and William Saalburg,
editors of the Jewisb Times and Observer.
Their object in calling was to place their
paper, the pioneer in Hebrew journalism
on this coast, at the disposal of the friends
of political equality. In its issue of last
week the Times paved the way, so to
speak, for coming out in favor of suffrage
by publishing a magnificent article on
"The New Woman in Israel"; and this
week's edition is to complete the good
work by boldly proclaiming the gospel of
equal political rights.
â  It is understood that many prominpnt
Hebrew society people are taking a deep
interest in the suffrage movement.
The young ladies' concert at Metropoli
tan Temple this evening promises to be
one of the social events ol the season. In
addition tot the debut of Miss Avid and
the reappearance of Miss Mann, the
Knickerbocker Quartet has promised a
selection. The other numbers on the pro
gramme are also of a high order.

AN ADMIRAL WHO IS SEASICK.
Naval < lflcers Not Always Exempt From
tbe Discomforts of the Ocean
"The belief that naval men and sailors
generally are never seasick," said an
officer on one of the big warships anchored
off Stapleton, "iÂ« a mistake. There are
men high ranK in our navy to-day, one of
whom by the way, is an admiral, who are
invariably seasick on their first cruise
after shore duty. One such officer is al
waj"B laid up for two or three days on his
cruise, and he is too ill to attend to his
duties.
"Every one in the navy knows this weak
ness of the officer to whom I refer, and I
saw only the other day that after a long
period of shore duty he was expecting to
go to sea again to serve a short time before
he was retired. He has tried various pre
ventives of seasickness, and experience
has taught him that they do him no good.
He 2a,ve them up long ago, and in recent
years he has begun his cruises with tbe
certainty tbat for two or three days he
would be deathly sick, and in no case has
he been disappointed. I have seen old
sailors so seasick that they couldn't work,
and I have come to thn couclusion that
there are many men who never can con
auer their weakness in this direction, no
matter bow much time they pass aboard
ship." â New York Sud.

Explanation.
Toe arrow flies with the wind. The top figures
at stauon indlcare maximum temperature for the
days; thoie underneath it, if any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and huudredths,
during the past twelve houra. Isobars, or solid
linÂ»s, conm*ct poln s of equal air pressure; Ib'j
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hleh" means high tarometrlc pressure and
is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by clou'iy weather and rains.
"Lows" us ally first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure Is high In the interior
and low along the coast, and the Isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" Is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. WHh a "high" in :hc virinit}* of Idaho, and
the pressure falllnit to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder

NHW* YORK- MARKETS.
Financial.
; , NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 6.-Stocks in the early
dealings were weak and loner, the act ye issues
showing a reaction of i/i@l Vie in the half hour.
The weakness of : the market was due in agreat
measure ito â¢ the ; further decline of J/ife %c per
pound in refined sugar, 'although the lower cables
from London were not without influence in certain
quarters. Sugar, Manhattan, the grangers and
leather preferred were particularly weak spots at
this time. "i The downward teilienc/ was checked
b efore midday by more I sudden though not | unex
pected weakening in the sterling exchanges.
Posted rates were reduced to $4 82 x /aÂ©4 8 4 14. Tne
break was the result of the complication of the
remittances for October ln.ere.st and an increase
in the supuly of grain and other speculation. The
weakness of the sterling exchange, according, to
the bulls, will more than offset these developments
and ' they, furthermore, 'â :â  were predicted ; by a to
newal of gold exDorts. . Manhattan led the rise in

ILECTRIC RCAD TO LIVERMORE
All Work Will Be Abandoned Shoula
Financial Confidence Not Be
Restored.
Oakland Office San Fbancisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Oct. 5. J
In every portion of Alameda County
many lar^e undertakings are being held
in abeyance pendine the result of the gen
eral election. These enterprises mean the
putting into circulation of not less than
three or four millions of dollars, most of
which will be paid for labor. But not one
of these undertakings will be started till
the settlement of the financial question
has restored confidence.
The development of the great scheme of
M. Smith, the borax multi-millionaire, to
settle Emeryville and open his new ferry
service to San Francisco, has been delayed
two years because of the prevailing un
rest. Mr. Smith has frequently outlined
his plans, bui he is patiently waiting to
see what November 4* produces.
At the immense mines and railroad en
terprises at Corral. Hollow things are not
rushing just now. R. W. Ellis, proprietor
of the Livermore Herald, who keeps a
close and jealous watch over that part of
the county, says tnat Mr. Treadwell is
waiting for tue financial cloud to lift.
"When confidence is restored to the busit
ness world," said Editor Ellis to-day,
"Mr. Treadwell will make the dirt fly over
the hill. He is in no sense a politician.
He ii as strictly business as they make
them. Personally he doesn't care a rap
about McKinley and Bryan; he is inter
ested in the campaign only as a capitalist
who has put $1 000,000 iuto a great minine
project and wants to work and develop
the property and give employment to
thousands of men. He knows that Bry
an's election would mean turmoil and
confusion in the financial and industrial
world for years to come, and tÂ£Â»at it
would mean war in Congress over the
money system of the country which
would paralyse the National finances and
plunge* the people into depths of distress
heretofore unknown."
Nearly a year ago a franchise for an
electric railroad from Oakland to Liver
more was awarded by the Supervisors to
E. P. Vandercook. There is a splendid
prospect for the road, which would skirt
the foothills, and there is capital available
to build it, but the uncertainty of the fu
ture nas effectively snut out the possibil
ity of floating either stocks or bonds and
nothing has yet been done.
Nearly all the riehts of way have been
secured and the route surveyed, but the
surveyor's stakes will be all tliat will be
seen ol the road if November 4 does not
restore National confidence.
Eugene Brown oi the tirm of Brown &
Macdouald, who have erected some of the
largest buildings in the city, stated tbat
he had seen the plans of four large build
ings, not one of which would be erected
if McKinley should not win out.
These are but a few of the incidents that
go to explain the interest felt in the cam
paign in this county.
THEY FEAR DIVISION.
Resident! of Teme<Â«cal Want to Incor
porate Before Oakland aad Berke
ley Take the Territory.
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. s.â The residents
of the Temescal territory are in a state or
absolute terror lest their district be taken
up partially by Oakland and partially by
Berkeley and they are hard at work circu
lating a petition which shall give them a
corporate life of their own, and it is being
signed by nearlj every one to whom it is
presented. The boundary lines of the new
municipality, as set forth in the petition,
are:
Beginning at the northern limits of the city
ol Oakland at a point 150 feet east of the east
erly line of Broadway and running thence
northerly to the souttieny line of the property
of Mrs. Â£. B. Crocker, ihence northwesterly
along that une, dividing a parcel of the prop
erty of Edson Adams almost in two equal parts
and continuing to the southeasterly corner of
Berkeley, and ihenc" following me southerly
line of Berkeley out into the waters of the bay.
This parcel of land is divided nearly in
hall by Temescal Creek and those resid
ing nearest Oakland desire to come into
tiie city, and should their idea prevail the
dividing line would be the creek. This
would leave the northern half to go into
Berkeley or to remain outside as it is now.
The matter is being agitated freely, and
if something is not done at once to save
the division it will come. Said a promi
nent merchant of Temesral : "Here 1 have
built up a good busines-s, and if thi3 part
is taken into Oakland I must pay $100 a
quarter license to do business across the
creek, where many of my patrons reside.
I favored the move to take this all into
the city, but we were defeated, and all
thai remains for us to do now is to incor
porate or go down as a divided territory.
If we incorporate we can stand out until
we can go into either Oakland, Berkeley
or the city and county of Oakland. This
way we are no one, and no one has any
thought for our welfare."
Associated Charities.
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. s.â The board of
directors of the Associated (Jbaritie have
re-elected the Rev. E. S. Chapman, D.D.,
as president; the Rev. H. M. Knigtit,

treasurer; Mrs. Helen Kelly, re-elected
secretary ana superintendent. When it
came to the selection of the last-named
officer Mrs. Kelly refuse i positively to again
accept the position as it wtÂ»s one of great
responsibility and very trying at tte best,
and some opposition had been manifested
to her in certain directions. The matter
was gone over thoroughly by the direc
tors. It was found that tue whole
trouble arose from the jealousy of one
wno haa noCHU.se. The members of the
board gave their unqualified in iorsement
to the secretary's work, and in isted on
her remaining in the office, to which she
finally consented.

masters under the civil-service rule. Two
counties reported operations already along
this line. This league has only been or
ganized for three months, but has within

masters. They hold monthly meetings,
going from one locality to another in order
that no one place will have the benefit
by reason of less expense in attending.

PROVED THE TEST.
The Tuberculin Treatment Finds Four
Cows Oat of Forty to Be
Afflicted.
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. 5.â A local dairy
has just been put through a thorough
test with the tuberculin treatment, and of
forty weil-led and healthy-looking cows
four were found to be afflicted with tuber
culosis. The work was done by City
"Veterinarian Pierce, assisted by Dr.
Archibald. The owner consented to the
killing of the afflicted animals and they
were found to have well-developed cases
of tuberculosis.
pDr. Pierce was highly gratified at the
outcome of the test and said that this was
another proof of the efficiency of the test.
Three of the cows wen* as fat as any
butcher would ask for. Without this test
the disease would never have oeen di cov
ered until the animals had wasted away,
and iben there would be no end to the
darnajre done.
Dr. Archibald said he was firmly con
vinced of the genuineness ol the test, and
continuing .said: "These cows were so
fat that any butcher would have read:iy
purchased them. If out of forty cows we
imd four diseased it is quite reasonable to
suppose that other dairies are no better
off. The particular; dairy from which
these cows came is in belter shape and
cleaner than ibe ordinary run of dairies. "
Parisian restauant-keepers mix a little
honey with their butter. This gives it an
agreeable taste and flavor, and makes the
inferior butter more palatable.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TDESDAY, OCTOBER 6, 1896.
WAS PARDONED
BY VICTORIA
Spackman Once Eloped
With a Salvation
Army Lassie.
Friends Say He Is Not the Kind
of a Man That Commits
Suicide.
ABSENT NEARLY ORE WEEK.
Wbiie an Unpardoned Deserter He
Said He Was Shadowed bj
Detectives.
Oakland Office San Fbancisco Call,i
908 Broadway, Oct. 6. f
Nearly a week has passed since Samuel
Spackman cot up in the middle of the
night and left bis wife and babies and
nothing has been heard or seen of him.
The theory, however, that he has com
mitted suicide does not meet with favor
from those who have known him for sev
eral years.
Spackman Is an Englishman, with a
history of the kind that does not generally
belong to a man that fears the future suffi
ciently to anticipate it by a violent death.
The missing man was a deserter from
the British army, and for a long time after
he came to Oakland he was always In fear
of being found by a detective. Wben in
company he would frequently point out a
man and declare that he was shadowing
him. Spackman did this so often that he
created the impression that desertion was
not the only cause -for which he left Eng
laud.
After a time Spackman entered the Sal
vation Army and was a very devout wor
shiper for a time. While an ardent re
ligionist be met Miss Christine Christen
son, who wore a hallelujah bonnet and
sang very sweetly Spackman and Miss
Cnristenson became very friendh>and one
day they were both missing. They went
north and lived a few months, and then
Spackman came back to Oakland. Miss
Christenson has since married.
After his return to Oakland Spackman
received a pardon from Queen Victoria for
deserting her army, and he exhibited it
with much satisfaction. He soon entered
into another engagement and then became
a labor orator and Keilyite. His next
move was to marry bis present wife and
open a small fruitstore on Franklin street.
The store was not a paying venture, and
one night it was seriously damaged by
fire. T c insurance companies wer- not
quite certain of the fire's origin and found
no difficulty in effecting a compromise lor
a much smaller figure than the policy'
cailed for. Spackman has been living fn
West Oakland for some lime and worked
at the racetrack. Since his marriage,
about four years ago, he has always look -d
after the interests of his family. Very
little faith is placed in tho letter he wrote
to bis sister in England mentioning
suicide, and it is thought he is in some
other part of the State.
A BUSY TOMATO PLANT.
It Is Climbing Skyward at a
Record- Breaking
Pace.
Berkeley's Prize Vegetable That
Grows Up to Second-Story
Wind ws.
BERKELEY, Cal., Oct. 5.â J. H. Jef
fress, who lives on Delaware street, is the
possessor of a tomato vine 17% feet in
height and 12 feet In breadth, which he
has trained up the side of his house. The
vine is just seventeen months old, and
from it already there have been picked
1000 pounds of fine, large, marketable to
matoes. The prospects are favorable for
the yielding of as much more.
The vine withstood remarkably the
cold weather of last winter, and only
ceased to bear during the months of De
cember, January and February. During
the winter it shed its leaves after the man
ner of an apple tree, but in t c early
spring new shoots And new foliage were
sent out.
Tc-day the vine has growing on it ripe
tomatoes, green tomatoes, flowers and
tiny buds.
T"he vine is the pride of tlw community,
and scores of people from miles around
have come to gaze on this prolific speci
men of vegetable life. It is to Berkeley
what the famous spreading grapevine in
the Carpenteria Valley is to Santa Bar
bara.
A tomato vine seventeen feet in height
and five years o.d was reported from San
D-ieno County some time aso, but the one
in Berkeley is taller by half a foot, and is
less than one-third as old.
"The vine i- of the 'Excelsior' variety,"
said Mr. Jeffress to-day, "and when we
planted it little did we think that it would
reach such proportions. Its development
was so rapid tbat our special attention
was directed to it. We traiued it up the
side of the house and have given it much
care. The most remarkable thing of all
to me is the fact that the vine is growing
on the west sde of the house, and gets
only the afternoon sun. While this con
dition is a disadvantage in summer, it is
an advantage in winter. The vine will
probably reach the thirty- foot mark be
fore it stops growing. We may nave to
erect a f rameworK to Keep the vine from
breaking down with its own burden."

attacks the Board of Tiustees in an open
letter fcr their reported cutting of the
estimates for the new free library. He
says in part:
In endeavoring to reduce expenditures the
Trustees have struck a blow at the Free Li

the City Trustees only allowed $5800. The
estimate for the Reneral school fund was re
duced 6.39 per cent; of tne High School, 5.32
per cent; of the street, 6.57 per cent; of the
Health Department, 25 per cent, and the
allowance aske-i for the Free Library was le

Tue fixed expens s of the libraryâ salaries,
rent, gas, f'sei, printing, insurance, etc. â for
the year ending May 31, 1896, were $4051 76.
The rebinding of books cost $1016 19, news
papers and periodicals, the subscription for
wnich must be continued, cost $293 50, inaK
inp $5361 45. If the West End branch is con
tinued the cost will be $531 90, making a
total cost of $3393 35. And ior this the Trus

$5800.
He asks that 3 or 4 mills be added to the

ONE SPEECH IN HER LIFE
Mrs. Ross Remembers Well
Hearing Abraham Lincoln
Forty Years .Ago.
He Spoke From the Courthouse Steps
at Lewiston When Running for
United States Senator.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Oct. 5. \
Mrs. H. L. Ross has been married fifty
seven years and the only political meeting
she ever attended was one addressed by
Abraham Lincoln in 1858 when ha was
running for United States Senator.
Mr. and Mrs. Ross reside on Twenty
sixth street, and although both are far
advanced in years they still remember
clearly the only political meeting they
ever attended togetner.
"I remember the circumstances con
nected with Mr. Lincoln's speech in Lew
istown in August, 1858," said Mr. Ross to
day, "when he was running for United
States Senator against Stephen A. Doug
las. We were then living at Vermont,
twenty miles from Lewiston, and I drove to
the latter town with my wife. She had
often heard me speak oi Mr. Lincoln and
of his kindness to me when I was a lad
carrying the mail, and she wanted to see
him and hear him speak. I may say right
here that we have been married for fifty
seven years, and that is the only political
meeting she ever had the disposition to
MRS. H. L. ROSS, "Who Has Been Married Fifty-Seven Years and
Has Attended Only One Political Meeting. It Was Addressed
by Abraham Lincoln.
attend. I met Mr. Lincoln at my broth
er's and told him my wife had driven
twenty miles to hear him spenk.
"The first time I met Mr. Lincoln was
in 1833, between Canton and Levriston. I
was carrying the mail then. I overtook
him, and as we rede along he told me he
had been attending court in Knox and War
ren counties, and was on his way to
Springfield.
"1 directed him to Truman Phelps'
tavern and he stayed there over night. I
remember he had a large pair of port
manteaus on his saddle, which appeared
to be pretty well filled. I suppose he had
his lawbooks and some clothing in them,
for at that time lawyers who traveled
around the circuit carried their lawbooks
with them. He was dressed in a suit of
Kentucky jeans, over which was a heavy
overcoat having four capes and fastened
with a hook and clasp. He also wore a
pair of green baize leggings, wrapped two
or three times around the legs and pinned
at the top and bottom. He looked very
much like a farmer.
"There was a debate at the Lyceum that
night, and Richard Johnson took part.
Lincoln wou the debate, and bis opponent,
who was familiarly known as 'Dick'
Johnson, came to California in 1850, and
was elected Attorney-General of the
State, and held several other important
offices. He came to see me after I came
to California, and in talking over old times
told me he never thought that the man
who had defeated him in debate would be
come President or the defeat would not
have felt so keen."
POLITICS AND MINISTERS
The Municipal Union Will Re
port Next Week on Pool-
Selling.
Rev. Dr. Di le Says a Primary Is
Often More Important Than a
Prayer-Meeting.
Oakland Office San Francisco C*ll,)
908 Broadway, Oct. 5. J
Tho Methodist Ministerial Union, com
prising all ministers of that church about
the bay, met in the parlor of the First
Church here to-day as a change from the
regular meeting in San Francfcco. There
was a larÂ«e attendance, many bringing
their wives. There was a dinner at the
Galindo Hotel afterward, ana then the
balance of the day was devoted to visit
ine and sight seeing.
The paper of the session was by the
Rev. E. R. Dilie, D. D., of the Central
Methodist Church, San Francisco, and a
former pastor in this city. His subject
was, "Our Responsibilities for the Pre-ent
Conference Year." In the course of his
remarks he took occasion to reler to the
political situation and said:
"Jefcus taught us hs ministers to carry
religion into politics by himself taking a
practical interest in the social and politi
cal questions of his time. Discharge your
civic obligations, do your duty as a citi
zen. I acknowledge that politics is not a
minister's busines ; neither i> it a mer
chant's, nor a doctor's nor a lawyer's. Poli
tics ousht to be the business of nobody.
That is, there ought to be none who mike
a trade or occupation of politics. The
professional politician's occupation would
be gone if the better class of citizens, the
religious, the educated class, did their
duty.
"There are 4,000,000 voters in this coon
try who are church members and. 3, 000,000
more who are in sympathy wi.h our
views, who, should they join forces, could
change existing conditions as regards any
evil. We must attend the primaries even
to the neglect of our prayer meeting, if
necessary. Be willine to go to the saloon
or any other piuce where caucuses are to
be held, and in this way defeat the
schemes of the bosses and professional
politicians. This has been tried and al
ways with success.
"But surely it cannot be said that poli
tics, the art of government, is not the con
cern of the minister. If practical politics,
so-called, brings incompetent or corrupt
officials into office, he is a taxpayer and
has to iielp to foot the b'lls and replenish
the looted treasury. If politics brings dis
grace upon the city, be is a citizen and
must bear li is share of the odium. If politics
undermines the morals of tue community
he has children to whom he must hand
down the impaired inheritance."
Following the reading of the paper
there was a general discussion, during
which W. H. Bone, a layman of Berke
ley, gave a condensed account of the
new Oakland Trotting Park, the improve
ments, costs, etc., and how the manage
ment had secured the passage of an ordi
nance by the Board of Supervisors under
a suspension of the rules on the day in
troduced, granting them the privilege of
selling pools on the grounds. He believed
this was a place where some word of pro
test should be made by the ministers, as a
body. The matter was referred to a com
mittee consisting of Revs. Bentlcy and
Buchanan of Berkeley, Revs. Kummer
and Carroll of Oaklandand Rev. Bovard of
Alameaa, who are to prepare and submit a
protest at next Monday's meeting in San
Francisco.

BishoD G. Butterrield and H. John
Jones, the two footpads anested Friday
night by Policeman Fleming for robbing
Thomas Ctiristian, a carpenter, on Her

men about ten days ago on the corner of

SABBATH OF STAGNATION
The Rev. Mr. Ford and His
Flock Do Not Believe
in It.
Though Down on Sunday Picnics, He
Wou d Favor Religious Outings
on the Lord's Day.
"I don't believe in a Sabbath of stagna
tion," said the Rev. Francis S. Ford yes
terday, "and the Christian church, of
which I am a minister, in order to avoid
any term savoring of the severe Mosaic
Sabbath, calls the weekly day of rest,
recreation and religious â¢ worship by its
civil name, Sunday, or by the New Testa
ment designation, 'the Lord's day.' "
Last Sundaj evening Mr. Ford preached
a sermon in his church on Twelfth street,
taking for his subject "Modern Pharisa
ism," in which he expressed some views
which appear to be somewhat at variance
with the notions of the more straight
laced among the "evangelical" clergy. â¢
"I am willing to stand by what I said in
that sermon," continued the young and
popular preacher. "Of course I do not
wish to be misunderstood or misrepre
sented. The Sunday picnic with its scenes
of rioting and impropriety I consider an
abomination. The Lord's day passed
amid the toil and turmoil of the office,
shop or workroom is as bad if not worse.
What I long for is a reasonable Chris
tain manner of observing the day set apart
by the early church as one of worship and
de'ight. -
"The Apostles left us a pure and simple
Christianity, devoid of Jewish or pagan
forms, and" free from the stiff ceremon
ialism pf the Pharisee. What we s. ould
do is to essay the restoration of this early
purity and : smpiicity. Regarding this
one point of Sunday observance, Trajan's
letter, an ancient document of undoubted
authenticity, states that the early Chris
tians were in the habit of meeting and
partaking of the Eucharist at an early
hour on the first day of the week in order
that the remainder of the day might be
left free. ,
: "What ; I would sugeest for working
people would be either early church ser
vices, such as the Catholics have, leaving
the remainder of the Sunday free; for any
innocent . recreation, or else a sort of
sanctified, Christianized excursion, the
pastor and his flock going forth together
to listen to the word of God, to pray and
sing hymns under tue trees, and then to
enjoy the beauties of the same God's
handiwork in nature."
When asked how soon he intended car
rying the last suggestion into effect, Mr.
Ford answered:
"Ah, that is rather hard to say. At the
same time, such a thing may come to
â pass. Meanwhile, I hope my flock will
say when each recurring Sunday dawns:
'Tnis is the day the Lord hath made; let
us rejoice and be glad therein.' "

he has been unable to do much work.
She felt despondent and tired of life and
made up her mind that the only rest for
her was in the grave.

the meeting of the Congregational Mon
day Club, of which Dr. French is also a
member. In the portion of the meeting
devoted to reports from churches Dr.
French astonished the brethren by getting
up and saying:
"Before knowing the nature of the doc
trine that would be taught at the 'People's
Church' I allowed my name to go upon
the announcements, but having heard Dr.
Birch at tiie Temple Sunday evening, Oc
tober 4, I found his discourse a glittering
negation so far as presenting any spiritual
truth. He spoke of the need of backbone
in man, but his discourse was a shivering,
shimmering, gelatinous mass, with no
semblance of a spinal column; declared
tbat a man could net be lost, ana left his
audience to infer that tne Holy Spirit in
habited them all. He wove a mantle of
morality ample to cover 'the world, the
flesn and the devil.'
"His text was in part from John 111.
I wish he had quoted the thirty-sixth
verse, which say.Â«: 'He that believethon the
Son hath everlasting life; and he that be
lieveth not the Son shall cot see life, but
the wrath of God abideth oil him.' I
believe in God and in bis son Jesus
Christ, and that salvation is predicated
alone on faith in the atoning Christ
"I denounce these jellyfish doctrines
and disown any sympathy with a move
ment based upon such preaching."
Pastor Birch listened in silence to this
denunciation of his doctrines and did not
attempt a reply. When questioned on the
subject after the meeting he stated that
the attack was entirely unexpected, but
tbat it would not deter him from continu
ing his work. "These peopie professed
faith on Sunday," he said. "I preached
on the Prodigal Son, and there is no par
ticular chance in that to bring in the doc
trine of the atonement."
Dr. French when seen after the meeting
said tbat Pastor Birch had come to him
and asked him to be one of the sub
treasurers of the People's Church.
"I knew that some of the local churches
had indorsed the pastor, and I had not
the least fear of his doctrines," he said.
"Last night's meeting was the first I at
tended. I sat in the audience, and could !
hardly hold through to the end. As a j
man I have the kindest feelings toward j
Dr. Birch, but I cannot tolerate his sooth- ;
ing-syrup doctrines. I consider that he is j
belittling the judgment of God by attack- j
ing the validity of our common version of |
the Scriptures. He never once hinted at
the necessity of the new birth, as laid
down in our Lord's interview with Nico
dernus. He has a kind of a system of
religion, but it has not salvation in it.
Those worldly people say it is tine because
it sooths them to sleep."
Dr. Birch, not being a member of the
Congregational Monday Club, no action
was taken by that body respecting tue at
tack on his doctrines. Rev. J.jC. Holbrook
read a paper on ''The Notable Conversion
of the Eminent Scientist, George J. Ro
manes." Professor Baldwin of Pomona
was appointed to read a paper next Mon
day on "The General Congregational Con
ference of California," which will occur in
Sacramento this week. Most of the local
Congregational pastors will leave for the |
Capital City this morning.
Rev. J. Lyman Hood reported that a
permanent headquarters would not be
settled on for a month or two. Tili the
headquarters are secured the Congrega
tional Monday Club will meet in the
California Hotel.
Presbyterian Pastors.
Yesterday was quiz day at the Presby
terian Ministerial Union, the questions
discussed being: "Shall the Synod of
California Be Made a Representative
Body?" and, "Shall the Use of the Re
vised Version of the New Testament Be
Encouraged in Our Churches?"
In discussing whether the Synod should
be made a representative body, Rev.
Theodore Burnham of Vallejo made a
clea in the affirmative on the ground
that the Synod, if representative, would
equally represent the wnole State, instead
ol being lopsided, as he considered it to
be at present Rev. Dr. Bevier said that
difficulties in the way of every one attend
ing the Synod had made him in favor of
seeing it a representative body. "Tne
time is coming very soon when we shall
have to have a division," he said. "The
Methodist Episcopal Church has a north
ern and a southern conference, and we
shall soon have to follow auit with two
synods."
"Dr. Fraser believed that adopting the
principle of representation would avert
the need of dividing the Synod.
Rev. F. R. Farrand, who introduced the
question respecting the use of the revised
version of the New Testament, said he
was not in favor of seeing it used in pul
pits, unless it was adopted universally.
Tbe following new officers of the Minis
terial Union were elected: President, Rev.
F. E. Farrana; vice-president, Rev. R. W.
Reynolds; secretary and treasurer, Rev.
James Woodworth.
Occidental Board.
The regular monthly meeting of the
Woman's Occidental Board was addressed
yesterday by Mrs. S. S. Palmer, who gave
an account of missionary work in China.
Mrs. Dr. de Siiva spoke about Chinese
women, and Mrs. I. Condit and Mrs. J.
Kelly described how the home rescues
girls. On Friday, the 16th inst., the
Woman's Synodical Society for home mis
sions will nold an all-day session in Cal
vary Presbyterian Church, and on Satur
day the Woman's Occidental Board for
Foreign Missions will hold an all-day ses
sion in the same church.
HOPE OF HUMANITY.
Dr. J. A. Anderson Arguel That It
Dwells in Reincarnation.
Dr. J. A.Anderson lectured before the
Theosophical Societ> at Academy of
Soiences Hall Sunday evening. Histopic
was "Reincarnation, the Hope of Human
ity." The hall was crowded.
After paying his respects to materialistic
scientists and to spiritualists, Dr. Ander
son said:
"Reincarnation means tne procurement
of new ideals. If we know that as we
leave this earth so we will find it when we
return will we not seek for better things?
If we know that we live again and again
our horizon expands almost infinitely.
Reincarnation is that scope of human life
that is infinite.
"We come back, each of us, with just
that character which we have evolved.
This is the truth, the beauty of tbeosophy,
that we can make ourselves what we
choose. That which makes every man
different from every other man is simply
a conservation of the consciousness of the
past. Reincarnation is the very process
of evolution. Unless consciousness were
concerned it would be impossible for any
one to become greater than he was in the
past. This is the goal which theosophv
holds out to mankind. Is it not a noble
one? Let us then endeavor to live up to
something of our divine character."
SUITS THAT CAME NOT.
Sam Hirsch Charged With Swin
dling People by a Cloth
ing Scheme.
H9 Led Detective Cody an Exciting
Chase Before He Was
F nally Captured.
Sam Hirsch was arrested by Detective
Cody last night after an exciting chase
and was booked at the City Prison on
four charges of obtaining money by false
pretenses.
Hirsch, who is a chemist by profession,
has been for some time galling upon
people representing himself as agent for
S. Tonner & Co., clothiers, 217-219 Pin
street, and for Pursch, Kaskel, Weil &
Co., 22 Sansome street. He carried with
him samples of cloth and offered to sup
ply a suit at a cheap figure. He was al
ways well dressed and spoke fluently and
pleasantly and seldom failed in getting a
customer who would select a sample for a
suit.
Hirsch would obtain a deposit of from
$1 to $4 and would instruct the customer
to call at the store with the sample and
get his measurement taken and pay the
balance when the suit was made. When
thÂ£ customer would call at either of the
two stores he was told that Hirsch had no
authority from them to solicit custom.
The victims â nearly 100 altogether â
sent in complaints to police headquarters,
and on Saturday Chief Crowlev detailed
Detective Cody on the case. He got an
accurate description of Hirsch irono some,
of the victims and last night about 6
! o'clock he saw his man on MoAUJster
J street, near Gough. Hirsch ran into 673
i McAllister, shut the door almost in Codv's
! face and ran through tne kitchen in the
j rear and out into the yard. He climbed
I over the fence into an alley and ran to
j Gough street, alone Gough to Fulton,
down Fulton to FranKlin, along Franklin
to McAllister, up McAllister to Gough and
disappeared in Joost's hay barn.
Cody was close behind him all the time,
and as he is considered a sprinter Hirsch
must be no novice himself in tbat line.
Hirsch passed through the hay barn into
the livery stable, where Cody overtook
him.
D. R. Watkins, 1946 Fillmore street,
who is out $3, F. Clifford and William
Kandle. 2116 Fillmore, each out $1, and
G. W. Rick.y, 2122 Fillmore, out |3 60,
identified Hirsch in prison last night, and
these were the charges he was booked
upon.
About four months ago Hirsch played
the same game by representing himself as
I agent for tea firms, but he got out of the
I City in time. He has done The same work
in San Jose, StocKton, Sacramento, Fresno
and Oakland.
BIG ELECTRICAL PLANT.
Power for the Coulter ville Mines
to Come From the Tuol
umna
J. A. Coram, the Copp r King, on
the Efforts of the Merced Com
pany to G?t Oat God.
Among the arrivals at tbe Palace last
night was J. A. Coram of Lowell, Mass.,
director and one of the largest stockhold
ers in the Bntte and Boston and Boston
and Montana mining companies, Butte,
Mont., and in the smelters and railroads
at Great Falls, Mont. Mr. Coram is also
a heavy owner in great copper properties
in the Lake Superior region. He is ac
companied by C. N. Palmer, manager of
the Butte and Boston Company.
Mr. Coram and his friends are tbe own
ers of the mines of the Merced Gold Min
ing Company of Coulterville. which they
acquired over a year ago and have since
been developing extensively. They have
just come down from the mines.
The gentlemen intend putting in a large
electrical plant there and working the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 6, 1896.
mines 00 a greater scale than at present.
"I cannot givo all the details of the con
dition of the mine at present," said Mr.
Coram, "as I have not yet made up my
report. But I found the property in bet
ter shape considerably than I had ex
pected. We have been doing development
work, and it was not to be expected that
we would show up large ore bodies. How
ever, 1 am more than satisfied with the
way things look.
"We have expended in all, up to the
present time, about $500,000. I don't
know how many men we are employing,
but the payroll amounts 10 about $13,000
monthly.
"It is onr intention now to put in an
electrical plant, and we will get our power
from the Tuolumne River, bringing it by
pipe for a distance of eleven "\iles. There
is a fall in the river of 1740 feet, and we
have a ditch that carries during the lowest
period 1320 inches of water.
"The falls will give us something like
8000 or 10,000 horsepower for running the
machinery and carrying on the work of
the mines."
Mr. Coram says that though the ma
chinery at the mine is heavy and the
workings deep neither can conirjare with
that of. the copper mines in which he is
interested in the Lake Superior district.
There is a shaft there which is down 6500
feet, or considerably over a mile, and from
this there is an incline in the vein reach
ing a great distance. The machinery
necessary for hoisting is of enormous
power. Mr. Coram and Mr. Palmer will
be here only a day or two longer.
THE KING STILL LIVES,
Frank McManus, Monarch of
the Potrero, Is Con
valescent.
He Has Been Operated Upon by Dr'
Morseâ Reduction in His Splen
did Proportions.
Frank McManus, "King of the Po
trero" â up to the time Jack Welch
thrashed him for the third time and
wrested from him his scepter â is still
among the living.
The Kingâ for the title has clung to
him regardless of his many discomfitures â
lias just pulled out of the hardest battle
he ever had, a battle with dropsy and
death. For the past six months he has
been very ill, and Dr. Morse of the Board
of Health almost despaired of his life.
Recently a successful operation called
"tapping" was performed.
Last night during the bicycle parade the
King was around renewing acquaintances
and gathering in his stray subjects.
But he is such a puny King now. From
the majestic weiglit of 235 pounds he has
been reduced to barely 160.
ON THE CHARTER.
More Questions Regarding That Inter
esting Document.
J. Richard Freud continues his "quiz"
on the charter as follows:
What has been proved by the foregoing
questions and answers?
That the proposed new charter is a model
organic law and is infinitely superior to the
existing government of San Francisco.
W hat bearing have the constitutional amend
ments to be voted upon November 3 upon city
charters?
Constitutional amendments 4, and 5 are
really essential to the safe -and complete exe
cution of city charters.
Explain briefly the effect of these two consti
tutional amendments.
No. 4 takes away the power of the Legisla
ture to interfere in purely municipal affairs.
No. 5 will restore to cities the power of govern
ing their own officials.
Will these two constitutional amendments
deprive the Legislature of any necessary or
just power?
No; the adoption of these two amendments
will merely give cities local self-government
and the right to conduct and manage their
own affairs.
Did San FranciÃCo ever try to get anew char
ter?
Yes; three charters have been lost; one in
1830, another in 1883, and the last in 1887.
Why will the peopie of San Francisco ratify
this new charter on -November 3?
Because the citizens of San Francisco at last
fully realize the serious consequences of
trilling any further with the wretched con
glomeration that is absolutely wrecking and
ruining the city government.

CYCLERS RIDE
IN GUY ATTIRE
A Big Night Parade in
Favor of Good Pave
ments.
Gayly Decorated Floats, Some o'
Which Bore Suggestive
Mottoes.
BED FIRE AND PYBOTECHUICS
The Review by the Judges on Van
Ness Avenueâ Decision
To-Day.
Amid red fire, bombs, rockets and
music, the cyclers of San Francisco had
their display last evening in favor of good
roads. Ther| was a good number of
FANCY AND FREAKISH DESIGNS SHOWN IN THE BIG BICYCLE PARADE.
those who love to ride on pneumatic tires,
and the parade was witnessed by thou
sands, who lined the streets through
which the procession passed.
The cyclers were enthusiastic, and on
many points along the line they were
loudly cheered, and in response to the
cheers came the cry of the various clubs,
which often drowned the sounds of the
music in the band waeon. As an earnest
of a desire for good roads the parade, in
which there were more than a thousand
participants, was a success.
By the time darkness spread over the
City the hail of the Olympic Club on Post
street was a scene of great activity. There
was a rushing to and fro of those mem
bers of the organization who belong to the
cycling s ction, getting ready for the
event. There was the dressing of wheels,
the fixing of lanterns of various hues,
flags and colored bunting, flowers and rib
bons to make silent steeds candy ana at
tractive. And every now and then there
came from tne inner rooms participants in
riding attire, some plain, some gorgeous,
some comic and many grotesque. Some
of the young men appeared as ti;e new
woman and as the bloomer girl, while
others, who seemed to carry out the char
acter to life, appeared as clowns.
While this rush and excitement was
going on in the big building there was an
unusual commotion on Post street, from
Taylor down to Grant avenue. There was
a gathering of people on the walks anxious
to see t lie start, and collections of cyclers
on the cross streets, singly, in pairs and
by duos, nding to the various points
assigned them by the marsh il of the
ni?ht. Then camp the band wattons and
the floats and the fireworks wagons. Then
in a short time there was a lighting up of
lanterns and the burning of red and white
fire, which illuminated the scene and pre
sented to the onlookers a cay and festive
picture that resembled some grand carni
val. The gayly trimmed bicycles and the
vari-colored uniforms of the" riders were
brought out in tuli effect by these strong
lights.
Sharply at half-past 8 o'clock Marshal
Edwin Mohrig gave the order to fall in
and follow the band wagon, and to the air
of Sousa's "Liberty March" the procession
moved on. After the mounted police
Came the Alpha (ladies) Cycling Club, the
Olympic Cyclers, visitors on wheels irom
San Rafael", San Jose, Oakland, Alameda
and Berkeley, the Reliance Athletic Club,
Acme Club, "Camera Club Cyclers, Waver
leys, Pathfinders, Liberty Club, Golden
Gate Cyclists, Yellow Fellow Club, Yosem
ite and Eintracht Ciub, Imperial Club,
Union Iron Works Wheelers, Ramblers,
Columbias, Bay C ty Wheelmen, Barker
Cyclers and many independent wheelmen.
There were a number of attractive fea
tures in line, the most prominent of whicn
was a large float prepared by the Olym
pics. It was a representation of a Roman
gladiator (George Miehlins) extending the
hand of fellowship to the modern cycler
(Allen Jones).
The Pathfinders had in line an imita
tion prairie schooner such as was used to
cross the plains in early days, and labeled
the "John C. Fremont pathfinder of '46."
The purpose of this was to find a good
path for cyclers in the City.
The Olympics carried a transparency
bearing the words, "A clean sweep at the
polis means a clean sweep for our wheels."
Charles H. Northrop, made up as Rip
Van Winkie, an independent cycler, at
tired in a paper suit, carried a banner
with this strange device, "Journalism up
to date."
The Golden Gate Club had a float on a
double quad representing a golden gate,
festooned with flowers and hung with
many lanterns. The Yosemite and Ein
tracnt clubs were all attired as red devils,
with fierce painted faces. The Imperial
Club turned out an immense elephant,
mounted on a doubie quad, and on this

. Â«r "How to Curt Blood and Skin Humon," Xwt, r;
was a placard wi:h the words: "Don't
Tease the Animalsâ S. P. C. A." F. Mur
phy, also of the Imperials, represented
Uncle Sam riding a bicycle with many Me-
Kin ley emblems. The Ramblers had a
triplet riddon by three pretty children,
Eva. Maude and Walter Varney. This
club also had out a gayly decorated
sextUDlet, made up of three tandems
fastened siUe by side. "His Whiskers"
was out on a bike, snd there were bets of
even money that it was Judge Campbeil.
It was left for the judges to decide.
J. R. Rogers of the Imperials rode a
bike to which he I ad hitched two bull
pups that dragged him along at a lively
rate. The last float in line was that of the
San Francisco Road Club, representing the
Pony Express, a pretty arrangement.
There were several children in continental
costumes, two pages in full silver suits,
Indians, colored and Chinese cyclers, mon
keys on wheels and many rid rs in fan
tastic Karb. There was in line a number
of cycles fitted up as Doats with full sail.
One of these was marked "C. P. Hunting
ton." Another was labeled . "Opposition
ferry." Still another, in imitation of a
flatcar, had a streamer on which wa*
painted "This train carries bicycles free."
Still another design on wheels on which
there was a coffin bore these word", "Killed
by riding a wheel over the Market-street
pavement."
The mounted police had a great deal of
difficulty on Market street in keeping the
crowd back far enough to enable the
paraders to proceed. As soon as the offi
cers drove back one section of people and
rode on the crowd pressed forward and in
that way interfered with the paraders.
On the line of march a number of the
wheels broke down and had to be with
drawn, but none of the riders were in
jured. At several points along the line
there were displays of red fire and from
several points fireworks were set off.
Along the line of march on Golden Gate
avenue, from Market street as f ar out as
Van Ness avenue, the sidewalks were
crowded with spectators and every house
was alight, with windows open, so that
1 hose inside could see the interesting
spectacle. The steps leadine to every
door were tiers of people. Beyond Van
Ness avenue tne crowds extended on both
sides of Golden Gate avenue as far as Web
ster street, nor was it any thinner along
Fulton street, the line of return marcn.
On Van Ness avenue, between Golden
Gate avenue and Hayes street, there was
an immense throne, which kept the po
licemen busy confining it within the
proper limits, which were ail too small.
The various bicycle club houses were
decorated with Japanese lanterns, flags
and bunting, and some private dwellings
on Golden Gate avenue were similarly
illuminated in {sympathy with the wheel
men and their movement. The clubs con
tributed liberally of red fire and rocke s
and Roman candles to brighten the wheel
men's way, and, as it were, to express
their enthusiasm over the grand display.
It was a long, expectant wait that the
spectators had out in the limited district
of good roads where the two avenues
cross, but when the first rocket burst high
above them in the night a chorus of ap
proving exclamations made it plain that
everybody was happy and pleased with a
rest in tne cool evening air. And then in
a very short time, it seemed, another mur
mur and a stir followed. " Here they
cornel" was upon every one's lips.
They came, the fantastic, glittering
phalanx of wheelmen in carnival array,
with music ana red fire. Tliey came, ami
they passed like colors and forms in the
kaleidoscope, leaving an impression of
something beautiful and altogether odd.
Out on the smooth pavement the bicyclists
couid preserve good lines, and for tnat
reason the pageant was more to be ad
mired on Golden Gate avenue than when
the wheelmen struggled painfully uphill
and down grade along the rough pavement
on Maruet street. The last of the proces
sion nad barely gone out of sight when its
head turned from Fulton street into the
grand, broad avenue, there to be reviewed
by the judges: Mrs. A. L. C. Barnes, Mrs.
N. A. Robinson, F. H. Bushnell. W. R.
Wheeler, Cnarles G. Sparrowe, George H.
Davis, James 8. Devlin, John Scott, John
H. Dawson. C. O. Perry, J. H. Brunings
and R. C. Lennie.
There was considerable confusion at the
judges' stand, caused by the paraders
themselves breaking ranks immediately
afier passing and then blocking the way.
With the aid of several policemen Dr. Rot
tanzi succeeded in opening a passage and
the procession again moved through in
poor order with nearly every cyclist afoot
and elbowing for room.
It was generally conceded that the most
tastefully decorated and most artistic
wheel was the tandem of Mr. and Mrs.
G. B. Ludlow (No. 31), a really beautiful
effect in colors, flowers and rich oriental
lanterns. Miss Aiice Guthrie (No. 1), a
pretty little tot in white under a floral
Canopy, was noticed favorably. Miss
Minnie Huff (No. 15), as a page from the
Huguenots, attracted considerable at
tention for her original and grace
ful decoration. Mrss Lotta Crenshaw
(No. 55) as the "Examiner" in white satin
and silver appjared conspicuous for her
beauiifut costume. Miss Lottie Britton
(No. 16) was unique as Amelia Bloomer on
a child's velocipede. No. 35, Little Red
Riding Hood, ia ihe person of Miss Lau
rine Devany, won applause and probaLly
a prize. The yacht-rider (No. 11) was
Joseph Clunan. C. F*. Harrison (No. 70)
as the "Tough Girl" received favorable
notice. The Gate" tandem (No.
82), George Hale and Al Lewis, was one
of the most picturesque ideas well carried
out, and the Chinese laundry (No. 67), pre
sented by N. Conn, was taken as an odd
conceit. The two Mohrig children (No. 64)
on a tandem made a very good snowing.
The Olympics may expect to hear from
tneir double tandem float with the little
daughter of William Kennedy enthroned
on it.
There was so much to consider, so much
in variety, novelty, originality and taste
that the judges were compelled to reserve
their decisions until to-day.
More than seventy nails in Paris are
devoted to fencing, each presided over by
a fencing master more or less famous.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 6, 1896.
TWO MURDERED BY
PAGAN ASSASSINS
A Double Tragedy Enacted
in the Streets of
Chinatown.
Lee Ah M?e and Ah Chung
Murdered by Desperate
Highbinders.
THE BESTJLT OF A FEUD.
The Bo On Ton? and the Bo Leong
Tong Societies Are Supposed to
Be Implicated.
The highbinders seem to have broken
out again, and once more the deadly re
volver has been brought into use. Two
Chinese were killed last night â one at
840 Washington, and within a few minutes
liter a second one was fatally wounded on
Pacific street and. Bartlett alley. Both
men died within a short time.
Lee Ah Nee, aged 40. a waiter in the Yet
Ting How restaurant, 810 Clay street, was
shot to,death by an unknown assassin at
11:20 o'clock last night in the narrow
hallway of a Chinese lodging-house, 840
Washington street.
If there was a witness to the ghastly
deed, save the murderer, he holds his se
cret, and the murderer made his escape.
Wing Ong Tong, agent and rent collec
tor for the building where Lee Ah Nee met
his death, was in room 3, not ten feet from
the scene oi the tragedy when it
occurred, a-nd ho at once notified
the police. They came and found
the dead man in a pool of
blood, the bullet having taken an up
ward course in the neck, severing the
jugular. Around him were a nflm
ber of Chinese dishes, seeming to show
that he had just served a meal at room
95, one flight higher, as was tiis custom.
From the course of the bullet the unfor
tunate Chinese must have been descend
ing the stairway when the assassin sprang
out in the lower nallway.
The dead man was a member of the Bo
On Tong society, and his murderer is sup
posed to be a member of the rival society
known as the Bo Leong Tong.
Policemen Coughran and Dougherty
hastened to the scene when notified by the
rent collector, but neither they nor the
Chinese police cot any clews to the crime.
The dead man had been married tor
some years and his wife is now in China.
The murder was the culmination of a
lone-standing enmity between the Bo
One and Bo Leong Tongs, and is be
lieved by the police to be a move on the
part of the Bo Leongs to
avenge the death of Lee Ti, a
Chinese clam and fish dealer, and
a member of the Bo Long Tong, who was
shot to death on the iÃth of July in a hall
way leading to a gambling den at 25
Waverly place.
The police may be mistaken in their
theory, but it is certain that the murderer
and his victim were members of rival
highbinder tongs.
Shortly after midnieht,as Officers Nor
man Cavanaugh and Kaskall were busily
engaged searching for the murderer of Lee
Ah Nee, another Chinese, Ah Chung, was
shot down 'n cold blood.
The officers were passing through
Bartlett alley when they heard the report
of a revolver. Thoy hurried to Pacific
street, and found a wounded and rapidly
dying Chinaman lying on the pavement.
Walkinc rapidly up Pacific street was
another Chinaman, who, when he saw the
policemen, threw a weapon away.
He attempted to escape, but was over
taKen by Special Officer Downey and
brought back to where the dying man iay,
and was identified by him as the assassin.
The arrested man was taken to the Cali
fornia-street police station, and wnen
searched a large revolver was found on his
person.
He gave his name as Lee Loui, and de
nied having even witnessed the shooting.
Ah Chung was remo-ed to the Receiv
ing Hospital, where it was found that the
bullet had entered at the small of the
back and lad emerged through the
abdominal walls.
He was unconscious when taken to the
hospital and died in a few moments.
At 1 o'clock Officers Coughran and
Dougherty arrested How Fook and How
Turn and detained them at the California
street Police station on suspicion of being
implicated in the murder of Lee Ah Nee.
How Fook went to the restaurant in
which the dead man was employed and
ordered a meal for How Turn.
It is known that Tom was in his room at
the time of the killing, but Fook was seen
leaving the neighborhood of the crime in
a hurry shortly after the deed was com
muted.
A Uhinesp who called at the Receiving
Hospital to see Ah Chung shook his head
when he heard that his friend was dead,
and sa d: l4 Lots more be killed to-morrow,
big fight now."
MAY BE A BRIDE TO-DAY.
I ydia Allen, a Girl of 16, Arrested for
No Crime.
Lydia Allen, 16 years of age, and her
stepsister, Jennie Hubanks, 9 years of
age, were arrested on Saturday ni ht and
booked at the City Prison for some public
institution.
The two girls had been living in a room
at 137 Third street. Their mother is in
the City and County Hospital recovering
from the effects of an operation and their
stepfather is a waiter in the Hotel Rafael.
The family came heie on March 23 from
Oregon.
Lydia is engaged to be married to Henry
Kramer, a grocer, who used to call upon
the girls and helped them with a little
money.
Judge Campbell yesterday heard her
story and He sent lor Kramer. Kramer
said he was willing to niarrv her any day
and was quite able to support her. The
girl's mother has given her consent to tne
marriage, and her stepfather will come

AUGUSTE SCHMIDT DEAD.
The Prominent Merchant Saccombi to
an Attack of Heart DiÂ«ease.
Auguste Schmidt, senior member of the
firm of J. Pinet & Co., shipping and com
mission merchants, 504 Jackson street,
died suddenly from heart disease in Wal
ler's drugstore, Grant avenue and Geary
street, at 8 o'clock last evening.
Mr. Schmidt, accompanied by his wife,
was dining in a Geary-street restaurant.
He suddenly took a sinking spell and was
removed to the drugstore. A physician
was summoned, but the suffering man
was past medical aid and died in a few
minutes. The case was reported to the
Morgue, but Deputy Coroner O'Brien,
after an investigation, decided that death
was due to natural causes, and allowed the
body to be removed to an undertaking
establishment.
The deceased had been ailing from con
sumption and an affection of the heart for
the past year, and was under the care of
Dr. de Mai vi He.
ALL AT DAGGERS' POINTS
Photographers Allege That Mar
ceau Has Infringed a
Patent.
Attorney Miller Says Marceau Makes
Bas- Relief Photos, Violating
Taber's Rights.
Greek has met Greek and a battle royal
was the result Now photographer meets
photographer and the end is not yet.
Taber, the well-known photographer,
has filed suit against Theodore Marceau,
his equally prominent brother of the
camera, alleging that the latter has in
fringed a patent of his and praying for
his restraint from further infringement
and suitable damages for the injury done
him already.
It seems, according to the acoount given
by Attorney John H. Miller, Taber's coun
sel, that sometime in last March his client
was granted a patent for what is termed a
bas-relief photograph.
By this process an ordinary photograph
is taken and the prominent features are
made to stand forth boldly in a manner
somewhat statuesque.
"Now," said Attorney Miller, "this was
a great advance in photography, and much
credit is due Mr. Tabor for its invention.
He at once began to use it here.
'Mr. Marceau, however, discovered a
process producing similar results, the use
of which, he thought, would not be an in
fringement on Mr. Taber's patent. He
had a large collection of photographs
illustrating this process on exhibition at
the Mechanics' Fair.
"He has also used the process in his
business. Taber's patent, however, pro
vided for the broad iaea of transferring
tnese photographs in bas-relief in any
manner whatsoever. Marceau's variation
of one or two unimportant details gave
him no right at all to use the process.
"In law his act constitutes an infringe
ment on Taber's patent. Marceau has
been repeatedly notified of this fact, but
has paid no attention to it.
"Here lately it is understood that his
inten ion U to go East and start a com
pany with himself at the head for the ex
clusive manufacture of bas-relief photo
graphs, anrt to represent himself as the
originator of the method. To prevent his
doing so suit has been brought on the
grounds I have mentioned."
Suit was iiled Saturday to restrain Mar
cÂ«hu from infringing on what Taber
claims as his patent, to obtain an account
ing of the profits he has heretofore
made, if any, and for the damage Taber
believes he has suffered because of the
alleged infringement. It is understood
that the papers in the case will be served
to-day.
