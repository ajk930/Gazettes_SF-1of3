Bland is still on top. Interest Is now
beginning to develop on the Vice-Presi
dency. Ex-Governor Peunoyer of Ore
gon and United States Senator Stephen
M. White of California are prominently
mentioned, White having preference be
cause of his sound conservatism, good
business sense and uncompromising De
mocracy. If a nominee for Vice-Presi
dent should be selected from the Pacific
Coast Senator White will undoubtedly
be the man.
Democrats who have fought,, suffered
and bled for their party are disgusted
with the dime museum now being ex
hibited as the Democratic National Con
vention. They say that, composed as it
is of an advisory board of Populists, Re
publicans, socialists and anarchists, It
cannot appeal to the loyalty of the
Democrats or the at ion with the voice
of authority.
Congressman Bynum of Indiana told,
me to-day that if the Democrat;, adopt ;
a free silver platform and nominate
silver men for President and Vice-
President that will be as far an the so
called Democracy of the present con
vention will get. He meant that the
ticket would be defeated. The ignoring
of the tariff is sum in the present dis
cussion, Mr. B.vnum declared, to be a
fatal political error.
Senator Hill of New York arrived to

CHICAGO, 111., July 3.â The menagerie
of Populists, Republican bolters and dis
gruntled reformers from, the Democratic
ranks was in full cry to-day, and made the
air in the lobby of the Palmer House as
hot and muggy as that of a steam bath.
The paid spielers were out in the full force
of their chins, each the center of a per
spiring crowd, each very hot, very angry
and with a very menacing attitude, em
phasized by the brandishing of a clenched
fist in front of the nose of the person ad
dressed.
The name of Jackson or Jefferson is not
mentioned once. The spectators on the
balcony in the entresol catch occasionally
arising from the hubbub the names of Tel
ler, Bland, Matthews and Hill, but the
word "tariff" is not on the Democratic
campaign list this year. It is simply a
silver-plated sheet of brass full of sound
and shining which signifieth nothing.
So conspicuous, indeed, is the spurious
and miscegenated complexion of this con
vention and its hungry camp followers
that it has become a common subject of
remark not only on the part of outsiders,
but of that of the delegates themselves.
James H. Eckels, United States Comp
troller of Currency, who is here in the in
terest of the sound money men, says: "If
Democracy is to be given over to Populism.
Socialism and Farmer Alliance doctrine it
ought to be run decently and in oider, and
not in a. manner which makes the outrage
doubly shameful and unprecedented."
Mr. Eckels also deplores tne action of the
Illinoi- delegation In bowing down before
the dictation of Governor Altgeld and
agreeing to rescind the two-thirds rule, and
he predicts that the dictatorial spirit of the
Illinois deleeation and of Governor
Altgeld will be resented by a majority of
the convention. He deplores the fact, also,
that more attention is now being paid to
the advice and wishes of undemocratic
organizations and individuals who never
have been Democrats than to oreaniza
tioas and individuals who are now and
always have been loyal to the party. He
reasons correctly when he says that this
introduction of a mongrel element into the
Democratic convention will be repudiated
by ah good Democrats at the polls.
Mr. Eckels is not alone in his opinion of
the present gathering and it s methods.
By almost universal consent the affair
which is advertised to take place in the
Coliseum next Tuesday is being called
the hayseed convention. This appellation
is accepted by the friends of the Senator
from Colorado, himself a disgruntled Re
publican; by Senator Stewart of Nevada
a Republican, and Senators Lee .Mantle
and Dubois, both of whom were Republi
cans up to the nomination of Major Mc-
Kinley and the adoption of the protection
plank, and who left the party for the
party's good. Otherwise they would never
have bad the audacity to intrude their
suggestion into the Democratic party,
m uch less to ask that a Democratic National
Convention should nominate a Republican
as its Presidential candidate. But that is
what they are doing, and nobody seems
to be offended because of this cold-blooded
proposition.
It seems to be looked upon as a matter
of course that anybody on the outside,
whether Republican, Populist, socialist or
ana'2bist, may walk into the Democratic
circus like a little man after paying his
money at the door. Hence Mr. Teller's
friends have pitched their headquarters
â  '<-r the center of the Democratic rin^,

"i the face ol the Democracy just aa
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL
though it were the proper thing, and not
even a whisper of protest is heard save
from such lifelong sturdy and self-sacri
ficing Democrats as Congressman W. D.
Bynum of Indiana and others of tlie same
character who never bolted their party,
and in earnest voices, though feyÂ», are de
manding the reafhrmation of the oldtime
Democratic principles and the return to
time-honored and respectable methods.
Congressman Bynum spent the greater
part of to-day in the headquarters of the
Indiana sound-money delegation in the
Palmer House. Of thÂ» thirty delegates
from that State twenty-six favor free
coinage and four are for the present gold
standard. But these four claim to rep
resent the true Democratic sentiment of
their State. They have accordinely flung
their banner to the breeze, having en
gaged the finest parlors in that aristocratic
hostelry, and have gathered around them
a handful of representatives of the old
party â men whose words must be listened
u> with respect if not with aasent.
Among the leading gentlemen is Con
gressman Bynum. I had a talk with him
to-day and found him to be very outspok
en as to his opinion of the nondescript
character of the present convention. He
is a big man physically as well as mental
ly, and stands high in the regard of the
people of his State as well as his fellow
members in Congress. He is sucli a man
whose words woula have great weight in a
Democratic convention, but in the present
revolutionary committee it is not likely
that ht will be given a hearing at all. He
was especially severe on the element
which controlled the Indiana State Con
vention by which tha present silver dele
gates were chosen. He said that the State
Convention was made up of Populists,
cranks and disgruntled Democrats, who
dominated the convention all through,
while they turned down every honest, self
saftri firing Democrat of any prominence of
the State.
"The men who are here in the sound
money cause," said Bynum, "are the men
who have carried on the battles of De
mocracy and who have helped it to suc
cess in the State of Indiana. They were
not given a voice in th 3 convention to
show how they disregarded all their party
obligations. I will say that tliey ousted
the chairman of our State committee and
will not allow him to be a member of the
National deleeation from Indiana to this
convention. We are here to represent the
solid Democrats of our State, for it seems
to me that Republicans and Populists are
the leading spirits here. They seem to
| have a greater voice in the affairs of the
National Democracy than men higher up
in the party who were born Democrats.
I You know whom I mean â Dubois, Petti
! grew, Stewart of Nevada, Congressman
i Schaffner of Colorado ana others of the
! same political complexionâ all of them
! Republicans. They have set up their
headquarters herein the Democratic camp
and are booming a disgruntled Republican
for the Presidency on the Democratic
ticket. What ought to appear stranger
still is the fact that their advice, io*teaii
of being repudiated and ignored, is on
many points of procedure and policy ac
cepted with thanks."
"There is another organization here, not
a Democratic one, but a hodge-podge of
Republicans, Populists and other people
of the same fry, called the Bimettalic
League, an organization lormed in the in
terest of the silver miners. It has also set
up its tent in the doorway of the Demo
cratic council-chamber and is assisting the
nondescript politicians of this peculiar
convention in ignoring all the time-hon
ored and sound tenets of the Democracy.
There seems to be no disposition to re
form the very undemocratic manners of the
political dictators. Tne same men who
were here four years ago shouting for
sound money and Cleveland are shouting
against him now and in favor of the free
coinage of silver. The reason for their
change ol tune is that most of them have
Deen disappointed in their political ambi
tions, and they have now started on a cam
paign of rule or ruin."
"What will be the upshot of it all*" I
asked.
"They will adopt a 16 to 1 free coinage
platform," responded the Congressman,
"and they will nominate their candidates
for President and Vice-President." The
sneaker paused here.
"Well?"
Mr. B.vnum reflected for a few seconds
and then said: "That is as far as they
will get."
The speaker added that the substantial
men of the Democratic party were not
ready yet for the free coinage of silver.
"It is a departure from Democratic
principles and the platform. The tariff is a
7ery important issue at this time with the
working people of the United States.
Many new and thickly settled manufac
turing centers have been recently devel
oped in the gas belt, and the tariff will be
an issue of considerable importance to
them. If there was not a deficiency in the
revenue of the Nation that issue would
not cut any figure at all, but because of
the deficiency the tariff pioposition has
forced itself to the front."
"Do you think that the people of the
United States have been and are satisfied
with the operations of the Wilson bill?"
was my next question.
Bynum replied: "Somp manufacturers
are satisfied with the Wilson bill ana some
are not. Woolen manufacturers are com
plaining more than any others. The
whole woolen industry is complaining
more than any other I know of. T:,e iron
men don't seem to complain any, nor do
the ulass men.
"Our object in coming here and estab
lishing headquarters is to raise our voice
in protest against the threatened disrup
tion and destruction of the Democratic
party by the Populists, Republicans and
anarchists, who seem to be in control of
its organization. We have united our
forces in order to effect a concerted action
in the crisis with which the Democracy is
now confronted."
From what 1 have heard and observed
around the different Democratic camps
since I have been in Chicago I am of the
opinion that the voices of such steadfast,
determined and respectable Democrats as
Congressman Bynum and his associates
will not be heard, and that the gag will be
applied by the silver men in accordance
with the programme prepared by Gover
nor Altgeld.
Major Towles of the Biraetaliic League,
one of the nicest old gentlemen connected
with that organization, told me half an
hour later that from all he had been able
SAN FRANCISCO, SATURDAY~MQRNiyG, JULY 4, 1896.
to learn he did not believe that anybody
but pronounced silver men would be al
lowed to serve upon any committee or in
any capacity whatever in the convention.
He qualified this statement Â»vith great par
ticularity by saying that he did not speak
ex cathedra, but that was his impression.
It was his impression also, not derived
from any particular delegation or person,
but absorbed from the environment, that
if the National Committee should appoint
a temporary chairman who was not a pro
nounced silver man, he and the committee
would be turned down by the big silver
majority in the convention, and another
man of the convention's own choice seated
in his place.
New York's gold headquarters were
opened this morning in parlor S of the
Paimer House, with a Drave display of
flags and buntine, interspersed with por
traits of Hill, Whitney and other promi
nent leaders of the Democracy of that
State. At present it is their intention to
offer Hill as a vicarious atonement upon
the altar of gold as the temporary chair
man of the convention. This will be done
for New York by the gold majority of the
National Committee, and they expect that
the convention will crown Mr. Hill's bald
forehead with a garland of roses and seat
him on the throne in the big Coiisseum,
that grows like a thing of beauty out of
the gray sands of the shores of Lake
Michigan; but the presentation of his
name will give the friends of sound money
an opportunity of discussing the proposi
tion upon the floor of the convention and |
of warning the Democracy of the Nation
of the .peril in which it stands by its repu
diation ot sound money.
But notwithstanding this carefully pre
pared plan I do nov think that the advo
cates of sound money will be given a hear
ing at all. The Altgeld gag wiil beanplied
to them. The chairman of the convention
and the manipulators cf the silver linhton
the floor wiil so arrange matters as to j
choke off debate upon every proposition, j
and tney will do this ;n parliamentary man- ,
ncr as well. For instance, should a gold !
man ofTar an ait.. ro tb<* platforui |
some silver iesJer immediately after the \
question has been stated by the chair will !
move to lay the amendment of the gentle : |
man from New York on the table. A mo- I
tion to lay on the table not being debat
able, the question wiil be put, the {notion
will be carried with a whoop, and the
gentleman from New York will taks his
seat with a very red face and a bewildered
air. In any other case the previous ques
tion will be called for and debate will thus
be cut off.
By such tactics as these very carefully
prepared Governor Altgeld and his col
leagues expect to rush the business
through within two days. The Governor
does not believe in a grand-stand finish.
He prefers the Napoleonic tactics of mass- i
ing all his forces upon the enemy's weak- !
est point and crushing him at one charge.
This programme will be carried out to the ;
letter, notwithstanding the protest and re- '
monstrances of the advocates of sound j
money. There can be only one result.
Thf.v 1-time conscientious Democrats who
will y^ â  thus dragooned and trampled un

vei. "^ . advisers in St. Louis) will go home

graphed by the newspaper correspondents
to the journals represented by them, the
number of words sent in such special iet
ters running away up into the millions.
They add that from present indications
the Chicago convention will beat even
this record, and I have no doubt that the
San Francisco Call will be an important
factor in this race, so far as the Pacific
Coast is concerned.
The political cartoonists are still en
gaged in having fun with this most re
markable gathering. Tne Inter Ocean por
trays Boss Alteeld with an old-style re
volver in his belt labeiea "Ambition"
tying a bunch of enormous free-silver and
bossism firecrackers to the tail of the
weary Democratic mule. Back of him is a
barrel with Debs' face drawn upon it
filled with firecrackers. The subhead is
"Democracy's enfant terrible; he doesn't
care whether he brings up in the hospital
or not if he can only sky that neighbor
hood." The jocose grin on the face of the
Governor is in striking contrast to the
weary, sleepy expression ol the disgusted
mule.
The Tribune has a strip running across
the page representing incidents in the
career of "Pitchfork" Ben Tillman of
South Carolina. In one place he is repre
sented with bis pitchfork trying to pry up
the silver dollars cemented to the floor of
a fashionable saloon. In another place he
is seen wi;h the same instrument fishing
for the cherry in the bottom of his cock
tail glass.
Delegates arriving from the Eastern sea
coast and high altitudes and from the
balmy West are suffering very much from
the heat and many cases of prostration
have been reported at the hotels. Yester
day ci>;ht well-seasoned residents of Chi
cago were sunstruck on the streets. One
of them died instantly and the others
were taken to the hospitals, and yet the
mercury did not rise above 87 degrees
Fahrenheit. This would be counted
very cool weather in many parts of the
San Joaquin Valley in California, where
men and women pick grapes all day with
the mercury standing between 102 and 110
in the sbade during the whole season and
where sunstroke is unknown. The Call's
staff of correspondents are feeling very
well and keeping as cool as possible.

GARLAND HAS BACKERS.
The Ex-Attorney-General's Name
Added to the List of Silver Can
didates for the Presidency.
CHICAGO, 111., July 3.â The name of
A. H. Garland, Attorney-General under
Mr. Cleveland's nrst administration, has
been added to the list of candidates for
the Democratic silver Presidential nomi
nation. The Garland boom is not of the
instructed sort, but in tne Arkansas dele
gation, which is instructed for Bland, the
Kentucky delegation, which is instructed
for Blackburn, in the Tennessee delegation
and other delegations, it is claimed that
he has personal friends who are putting in
quiet Out effective work in his behalf. His
supporters only intend to name him as a
candidate in the event that the leading
men become so deadlocked that it may be
deemed the part of wisdom to cast them
all aside and take up some new man with
no antagonisms and adverse record to
contend against. They claim that ex-
Senator Garland was an original silver
man with a clear record on that subject in
the United States Senate and that he
gained a wide acquaintance with public
men and affairs during his service in
Washington, which fully qualified him
for the nomination.
THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE

CHICAGO, 111., July 3. â Chairman
Harrity has called a meeting of the Na

which the matter of the temporary organi
zation will be settled.
B. B. Smalley of Vermont, replying to
the question. "What will the committee
do?" said: "Why, do as they have always
done. The members can do nothing else.
1 am going to support the nominee of this
convention, but I don't propose to be told
by anybody how I shall discharge my
duties as a member of the National Com
mittee. I have no responsibility after
that is done. I recognize the fact that I
am but one of a small and powerless mi
nority, which can only wait and see what
the triumphant majority will do."

WATERLOO, lowa, July 3.â Governor
Boies left for Chicago to-night at 7:30
o'clock unescorted. AÂ« usual, hÂ« had
nothing to say, but his countenance
beamed with a smile that betokened con
fidence in the result of the convention.
Mr. Boies has spent the past week hand
line and answering the great volume of
mail matter that is arriving from all sec
tions of the country. It is understood that
he will not enter the convention as a dele
gate at large, having delegated t' at duty
to Judge Van Wagenen of Grand Rapids.
BLACKBURN'S AMBITION
Would Probably Be Satisfied With

LOUISVILLE, Ky., July aâ While it

name will be presented for first place on
the ticket, the Kentuckians will keep an
eye out for combinations by which they
may receive second honor. It is known
the Senator would be content with this
recognition, and not only that, but would
be glad to have it. It may be expected
that the oulk of effort by his friends in
Chicago will be directed to this end.

Chicago, 111., July 3.)
The vigor with which the Teller men
are urging hia candidacy for the Demo
cratic Presidential nomination by the Na-
I tional Democratic Convention is causing
j much speculation among the other forces.
j It is not believed possible, however, that
j the Colorado silver statesman can secure
! the coveted prize. Tbere are too many
! wiiite-metal candidates in the field for the
: Democracy to ser.rch outside for a chief
| torchbearer. Still the matchless energy
; of the Teller people must be admired; even
if they do not succeed in having him nom
inated for President by the convention
they will have considered that they have
I won a great victory, and will doubtless
! gracefully retire and go before the country
!on an independent silver platform. It
| was lately thought that the Teller boom
had been punctured, but when Senator
Stewart of Nevada got into town ha
plugged up the boles, filled the balloon up
full of fresh air and started Teller up
afresh.
Senator Stewart was asked if he would
have the Democracy boom the silver party
I of the country and he replied :
;'lt; 'lt was a silver party under Jefferson
i and Jackson. If you mean by a silver
' party a party which is in favor of the frse
i and unlimited coinage of both gold and
silver at a ratio of 16 to 1, without asking
peimission of the mother country, then
this would not prevent the Democratic
party from returning to the usages and
j customs of the better days of the Repub
| lie by repudiating the usurpations of
i Cleveland, whicn are consolidating the
powers of the Government in the execu
tive, nor would it interfere with the re
turn to an economical and honest admin
j istration of the Government. All these
things would be done by the true Democ
racy, which would return to the money of
the constitution and follow the teachings of
I Jefferson. This ougnt to be done willing-
Ily Dy every Democrat in the land unless
j he can discover something in Cleveland's
administration which would have been
approved by Jefferson. In short, if Dem
ocracy is instrumental in rescuing the
I United States from the government of an
! alien gold syndicate through the instru
j mentality of banks, money-changers,
stock-jobbers and gold gamblers it must
repudiate not only the administration of
I the man from Buffalo, but also that of his
predecessors for the last twenty years, and
become a Jeffersonian party by observing
the principles which he inculcated and
repudiating the alien rascality and imbe
cility of the servants which the money of
aliens has been putting in the White
House for the last two decades."
"Do you find much sentiment here in
favor of Senator Teller's nomination?"
"Nearly every man I met here was for
Teller if the other fellow was, but he did
J not know what his neighbors thought
I about it, and he did not want to say until
! somebody else had said before him. This
j is the language of the multitude, but later
| in the day I saw a goodly number of men
I who seemed anxious to have it known that
they were in tavor of Teller and succes3
i and opposed to taking any chances of de
j feat. I think when the delegates get to
j gather and talk it over they will come out
all right and nominate a candidate who
will make Hanna think his candidate has
the habit of the crawfish, which crawls
backward."
The Bland men are not very much
alarmed over the turn the boom has taken.
They still believe that their candidate,
who is now in the lead, will have no
trouble in winning out. Consequently
; they look with indifference upon the as
pirations of other candidates.
'"We are not worrying over the senti
ment which is being developed in favor of
j Teller," says Senator Farns, the Bland
1 boomer of Missouri. "Now, he is a great
man, and should he ever become President
of the United States, the bimetallic sys
tem of money adopted by the Democratic
fathers in harmony with the constitution
! would be restored as early as possible.
The election of Mr. Teller would be a great
victory of the masses over the classes, and
no man would rejoice more over the
triumph than Mr. Bland. If the free-silver
delegates to the convention think that he
(Teller) is right on the financial question,
| and ti at he would poll the largest vote,
Mr. Bland's personal interest will not
stand in the way of success. But the
friends of Mr. Bland believe that he is the
strongest roan before the country to-day
and feel that he can be elected."
W. A. Clark, the Montana millionaire
and chairman of the delegation from that
State, arrived at the Auditorium Annex
to-day and engaged an expensive flat on
the parlor floor of that magnificent hotel.
Mr. Clark is mentioned as a Vice-Presi
dential possibility. When I saw him to
day, however, he casually observed that
Montana had no candidate. The mem
bers of the Montana delegation, however,
would be very glad to have Mr. Clarlc
nominated for the second place on the
ticket. He is a liberal spender and would
not be averse to going down into his sack
to help the Democratic cause, especially
because of the party stand upon the finan
cial question. There are six delegates
f roru Montana and they come unpledged.2
to the convention. Of course they are
out-and-out silver men and not; ing less
than a free and untrammeled declaration
for free coinage of the white metal on a
-reasonable ratio will satisfy them.
"We are not in favor of any particular
candidate," said Mr. Clark, "but will
accept any man who is for the free coinage
of gold and silver with the ratio of 16 to 1.
We will accept no overtures from the gold
men. We have the convention in our
grasp and propose to hold it. How about
David B. Hill as temporary chairman of
the convention? We don't want him, we
will nominate a silver man for that place.
Why should we concede anything to the
gold people? Why should we concede
anything to the enemy? There is no ne
cessity for it. We are in the majority.
Besides, they will make no concessions to
us. Montana has declared absolutely and
unequivocally for silver. All the delegates
will be here next Sunday morning in ad
dition to 200 members of different bi
metallic clubs of the State, headed
by the Montana band. I want to say
to you that this is one of the best bands in
the country. It will give several concerts
here, and the people will be able to judge
of its merit. Montana proposes to do
everything it can to swell the rising tide
for gold and currency, and the people of
that State believe that a silver platform
with a silver candidate will result in a
silver victory."
Mr. Clark is a keen, active little man
and wears a bunch of whiskers on his
chin.
Dr. Mullinix of Oregon is making an en
ergetic canvass in the interest of ex-Gov
ernor Pennoyer of that State. The doctor
says he will present the name of the Web
foot statesman to the convention in the
most eloquent speech of his life, and it
may be said right here that the doctor
is a good silver talker. He is not averse
to Stephen M. White of California for sec
ond place on the ticket, but says that Pen
noyer will accept no compromise. In a
preamble which Dr. Muilinix hands out
to the delegates to the convention he pre
sents the history and virtues of the ex-
Governor of Oregon in the following lan
guage;
"Pennoyer of Oregon â a Democrat of the
Jeffersonian school â born in the State
of New York in 1831, graduated at the
Law School, Harvard, in 1854, came to
Oregon in 1855. eventually engaging in the
lumber business. Elected Democratic Gov
ernor in 1886 by 2500 plurality ; re- elected
in IS9O by over 5000 plurality; elected as
the regular Democratic and Populist can
didate for Mayor of Portland June 1, 1896,
by a plurality of over 2000. After
being elected Mayor without previous
pledge or promise, he voluntarily reduced
his own salary one-half to meet tne fall in
prices and values resulting from the sin
gle gold basis. He refused to call out
the militia during a threatened railroad
riot, insisting that if the company would
pay its men ptace would be preserved.
â¢Pay your men,' he said, and the men
were paid. He has always favored equality
in the coinage and use of standard money
of both the money metals of the constitu
tion and an equality of protection to the
waee-earner as welt as the manufacturer
and producer in the adjustment of revenue
taxation, rie defended the clearly re-
Berved riphts of trie Siates against at
tempted Federal executive domination in
his celebrated dispatch, 'I will attend to
my business; let the President attend to
his.'
The scene about the hotel corridors to
night is one of great excitement. The sil
ver''rooters" are making the night hid
eous. They hold absolute sway and the
gold men are not in it for a minute. It is
quite evident that the sentiment of the
majority of the people who are gathered
in Chicago for the great National Demo
cratic pow-wow next week is with the sil
verites. The gold men are making a poor
showing and there is no question but that
eventually they will be obliged to take to
the woods. Frank McGcire.
CANNOT AFFECT SILVER.
Cold Advocates to Bs Governed by
Men Who Have Championed
the Yellow Metal.
CHICAGO, 111., July 3.â The arrival of
the New York delegation to-night had no
noticeable effect upon the situation, it
was thought in some quarters that the
â¢ New Yorkers might create some change,
but the fact is few people took notice of
their arrival, despite the fact that tney
came into town on a special train.
Senator David B. Hill, who is being put
forward by the gold people for temporary
chairman, has a parJor at the Palmer
House, while William C. Whitney went to
roost at the Auditorium. Neither had
anything new to say.and both early retired
to rest. They feel, however, that they
have been vanquished and that the gold
men will be an ignominous quantity in the
convention next week.
The indications are that the meeting of
the gold men at the Auditorium to-morrow
will in no way affect the silver interests. It
will be governed by the men who have
long since been shouting for the yellow
metal. Bland is still in the lead, with
Boies a close second. Matthews and Mc-
Lean have been placed in the icechest in
order to cool their enthusiasm. The siiver
men are strenuously opposing the appoint
ment of David B. Hill as temporary chair
man of the convention. The name of
Governor Altgeld has just been sprung as
the permanent chairman of the organiza
tion.
The pictures of Stephen M. "White of
California and Sylvester Pennoyer of Ore
gon will adorn the walls of the hotel cor
ridors on Sunday. Both are prominently
mentioned for second place on the ticket.
Either would not be acceptable to the Na
tional Democracy. Frank McGcibb.
FOR SILVER AND TELLER,
Colorado Fl&hters and Democratic
Delegates Depart for the
National Convention.
DENVER, Colo., JulyS.â This evening
the final contingent of Colorado silver
fighters departed for Chicago, accompany
ing the Democratic delegates to the con
vention. Many prominent Republicans
nre In the crowd and they go to urge silver
first and Teller second.
Otto Mears, a very skillful State manager
of the Republican party politics, said to
day: "I shall go to work for silver and
Teller, but I am prepared to support any
Democrat who is square on silver. The
State is for a financial policy independent
of any other nation and wiil support the
ticket which declares for that. No Mc-
Kinley crowd can fool Colorado voters
now. It is too late."
A singular feature developed to-day in
the story of a rope which was used in
dragging Senator Teller's carriage through
the streets on the night on his great ova
tion. The six white horses were taken
from the carriage, though the parade
managers strenuously objected, and the
vehicle was drawn along the line of march
by shouting men and boys. The rope dis
appeared and a search was Instituted for
it, and only ]ate to-day it was discovered,
securely held by a member of the delega
tion which left for Chicago to-night. The
rope will be in evidence there next week.
Senator Teller repeats that he has never
believed very strongly in this effort to
place bis name before the Democratic
Convention. He, of course, would accept
the tender because he believes it is an evi
dence of the union of the common people
against the money power, but ho also be
lieves that if a silver Democrat is named
the silver men must support that nominee
regardless of party.
To Colorado people this growing Teller
boom is a great surprise and while they
would unitedly rejoice in hi 3 nomination
few expect it Even the Colorado dele
pates do not believe Teller will be nomi
nater nor are they persistently asking it,
bnt they will cheerfully accept him if the
National Convention chooses to indorse
him. The main question of the silver
issue being above candidates has not been
lost sight of for a moment. Colorado has
been dead in earnest on the financial
question for some time and party candi
dates are not discussed.
Senator Teller is resting at the home of
his brother and requests that he be per
mitted to rest. To-morrow night he has
consented to deliver the dedicatory ad
dress of the Eisteddford Auditorium at
Arlington Park and he will there address
the people on the issues of the day. Later
in the campaign, if he is not nominated in
Chicago, he will make a tour of the States
of lowa, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, speak
ing for a silver platform and a silver can
didate.
POSITION OF TELLER.
Views As to His Possible Nomina
tion by the Democrats Defined
in a Letter to Dubois.
CHICAGO, 111., July 3.â Senator Teller's
position, as regards his possible nomination
by the National Democratic Convention is
clearly defined in the following letter which
was given to the press by Senator Dubois
to-day :
Mobrisov, 111., June 24.
Hon. Fred Dubois, Springfield, lll.â Deab Sir:
I reached this place yesterday and will remain
until the last of the week, when I will leave
for Denver. I notice the gold -standard Dem
ocrats have declared their intention to control
the Chicago convention. Ido not think they
can do it. If our silver friends control
the convention and give us a good silver man,
as I think they will, I think he would have the
active support of all who believe the money
question is the great question before the
American people.
We must, for this campaign at least, overlook
all minor differences and put the country on %
sound financial system that recognizes that
gold and sliver are the moneys of the constitu
tion. I believe this can be dove, and to that
end we will bend all our energies. A little
more patriotism and little less partisanship is
what our country needs at this time. The
friends of silver made no mistake at Bt Louis
and we must not make a mistake as to our
future allegiance with otber advocutes of
silver. The cause is of too much importance to
admit of carping or criticism. We must all get
together and act together until the battle is
won. It will be a royal battle with justice on
our side. We must win. Let me hear from
you soon. Yours truly, H. M. Teller.
GOLD FORCES CONFER.
It Only Results In a Decision to
Appoint Sub-Ccmmltt6es for
Missionary Work.
CHICAGO, 111.. July 3.â After all the
talk about the sensational happening that
might be expected from the conference of
the gold forces, led by William C. Whit
ney, the meeting to-night of Mr. Whitney
and those who are with him in bis en
deavor to secure some concessions from
the triumphant silver men resulted in
nothing more than a decision to appoint
sub-committees to do missionary work
with the incoming delegates.
For three hours Mr. Whitney and the
gold men discussed the situation, and al
though frequent applause drifted out
into the corridors from the parlors where
they held their secret session, there was
practically little developed to give hope
that the situation had undergone any
change, or that anything might be ex
pected from the silver forces.
It was 8:30 o'clock when Mr. Whitney's
cohorts assembled in a parlor of the Audi
torium and it was three hours later before
the doors were opened at the adjournment
of the meeting. Whatever of hope they
had at the beginnine did not progress one
iota during the time the conference lasted.
About 150 gold men were there and the
largeness of their number gave them some
encouragement at the outset.
Mr. Whitney called them to order in a
short speech. He explained that the
meeting was the result of invitations
issued by him and said the purpose was
to have a preliminary talk and secure re
ports from the various States, with a view
to getting at the general situation. At
his suggestion, Senator Gray of Delaware
was made permanent chairman of th<Â»
conference and Ben T. Cable of Illinois
and John A. Read of Pennsylvania were
elected secretaries.
The conference proceeded to its business
at once. The States were called alphabet
ically and somebody responded from
nearly every State. The jiold men frankly
admitted after the conference that not all
the responses were from regularly elected
delegates to the convention, but all the
men who did respond were representative
of the sections for which they spoke.
Those who told of the local situations
were listened to attentively, and some of
the remarks were applauded.
There was no lack of oratory, for Hon.
John E. Fellows of New York, one of the
most brilliant speakers iv the country, ad
dressed the meeting at length. In a beauti
ful word-picture he painted the disaster
that was sure to follow if the Democratic
Convention insisted in pursuing â  the
course the majority of its membership had
marked out. He spoke of the loyalty of
the New York Democracy and its grand
record of the past, but warned those pres
ent from other parts of the country that
the sturdy allegiance of the party in that
State would be sorely tried if it was com
pelled to support a ticket that represented
all that New York thought was unsafe and
unsound.
There was a natural indisposition among
those present to tell what was said by the
various speakers, for the reason that the
gathering was called to enable the gold
men to get 'acquainted with each otber
and with the sentiment that prevailed in
the various sections of the country. In
accomplishing this plain language was
used, and men were urged to give the un
varnished truth regarding the situation in
their States. During this interchange of
views it was apparent from the tone of the
men from the South that there was a
strong fear that if a free-silver candidate
on a free-silver platform was nominated
the Democracy would lose several of those
States. Especially was this claimed to be
true of some of the border States of Mary
land, West Virginia and Kentucky. Ten
nessee was also represented to be in the
greatest danger.
A number of the men from the South
ern States and not an inconsiderable num
ber from the East were in favor of bolting
the ticket, but this subject was not re
ferred to by such men as Mr. Whitney,
Mr, Harrity and Mr. Dickinson. Ex-Gov
ernor Flower was a little more outspoten.
He declared that he did not propose to be
bound |a hi 3 political conduct by the doc
trines of the Populist party, and if the
Democratic party saw fit to adopt a plat
form and name a candidate who was ,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JULY 4, 1896.
pledged to the cardinal principles of that
party, he, for one, did not propose to sup -
port it.
This outspoken statement from so prom -
inent a Democrat was seized at once by
others less known in the party's counsels
as a declaration of a bolt, and some one
asked Senator Hill what he bad to say on
the subject. The Senator took the edge
off the remarlc of his distinguished col
league by simply saying it has always
been his plan in political campaigns not
to borrow trouble and never to cross a
bridge until he reached it. This rather
non-committal answer was taken as an
intimation that the Senator not pre
pared to say that he would. bolt.
From other sections came the positive
declaration that the integrity of the party
and the honor of its representatives de
manded that the minority of the conven
tion give the people an opportunity to ex
press their sentiments at the polls by vot
ing a Democratic ticket that was in conso
nance with the traditions of the party
which had always stood for the best money
that the Government could provide.
Tuere is no denying the fact that the
outcropping of a desire to Bee a bolt was
manifest, but to what extent it may de
velop is to-night a matter for conjecture
only.
The leaders will not admit that a possi
ble bolt exists, even in embryo, but they
do state that the gold men are intensely in
earnest and have by no means given up
the fight. One of the most prominent
men at this conference, after it was over,
stated that the anti-silver men bad not un
derestimated the strength of the silver ele
ment, but hoped they would siill listen to
reason and the arguments that the gold
standard men would advance.
But those wordy proceedings finally
came to an end and the conferees before
adjournment did some matters that may
develop important results, although they
are of a routine character. It was arranged
that what is known as the "clubroom" of
the Palmer House should be maintained
as a permanent headquarters for the gold
people to meet delegates and others who
might desire to call. It was also agreed
that those who attended the conference
should assemble every night at the Audi
torium at 8 p. m. for secret sessions to de
termine future procedure.
An exception to this rule will be made
to-morrow on account of the gold mass
meeting to be held in the Auditorium
Theater, and to-morrow's conference will
be held at 11 a. m.
As soon as all the gold delegates arrive
a caucus will be again held â a sort of
erand rallyâ at which the plans of Mr.
Whitney and bis supporters will be
matured.
To-nigUt's conference did not get down
to any figures; it was more in the form of
a preliminary talk. All those present to
night say this, but will not make any pre
dictions.
The most prominent Democratic leaders
present were:
New Yorkâ Senator Hill, ex-Governor
Flower, ex-Lieutenant Governor W. F.
Sheehan, Hon. John R. Fe.lows, ex-Mayor
Hugh Grant, William C. Whitney, Wil-

ONE LITTLE PROGRAMME.
It Proposes to Give the Gold Stan-
dard Men an Exceedingly
Short Shrift.
CHICAGO, 111., July 3.â A brief, snappy
convention, debate cut off by the previous
question â "short shrift" and a speedy de
parture to the happy hunting grounds for
the gold standard men â is the programme
mapped out and openly promulgated by
those who assume to have in ti.eir hands
the control of the approaching National
Democratic Convention. And they
prophesy this with the utmost confidence
feur days before the meeting of the con
vention anc with barely one-tbird of the
delegates present in the convention city.
This is the talk wherever the silver men
congregate, and they claim they can have
everything their own way. That is when
they secure a two-thirds majority in the
convention.
Just now they fall a few votes short of
the requisite number to give them undis
turbed control and Michigan seems to be
the pivotal point. If the four gold dele
gate at large and the two contested gold
votes from one of the districts could be
disposed of the silver men could enforce
the uuit rule in the Michigan delegation
and thus could control the convention and
nominate any man they agreed upon in
caucus. The difficulty lies in the fact that
the regularity of the election of the Michi
gan gold men is conceded by even the
most rampant silverites. They frankly
confess that Don M. Dickinson outwitted
them and captured the convention, al
though they assert that the delegates in
structed for gold are personally in favor
of silver and would so vote if uninstructed.
The silver leaders admit an unwilling
ness to imperil the popular wave which
they claim is sweeping over the West and
South in their favor by resorting to any
qnestionable tactics for the unseating of
delegates known to be fairly chosen, and
they are looking around for means by
which to capture the necessary two-thirds
in some other way.
The strange fact remains that, according
to all accepted gossip around headquarters
and with New York not heard from, it is
assumed tnat the action of the Chicago
convention has been settled in advance
with as much certainty as was that of the
Republican convention at St. Louis.
The latest slate passed around is: For
President, Henry M. Teller of Colorado;
for Vice-President, John B. McLean of
Ohio; for temporary secretary and perma
nent chairman of the convention, Senator
"Joe" Blackburn of Kentucky.
Borne of Senator Blackburn's friends do
not limit his aspirations by acceding him
the chairmanship of the convention. Phil
Thompson says lie will be pushed for the
Presidency ami that ex-Congre-sman John
S. Reaof Owensboro, Ky., will place him
in nomination.

HIADQCARTKBS UNITED PRESS, )
Herald Building, V
Chicago. 111., July 8.)
It looks as though the Chicago Demo
cratic Convention would be quite as lop
sided as the recent Republican gathering
at St. Louis. There has been no break to
day in the monotony ot the signs and
tokens of what is to happen. It is to be a
free silver convention. Moreover, with
surprising unanimity the controlling men
of Eastern and Southern delegations have
declared their preference for Teller.
Nearly all his associates or former asso
ciates in the Senate who believe in free
coinage are giving him their support.
The list includes Turpie of Indiana, Jones
of Arkansas, Harris ot Tennessee, Walsh
of Georgia, Chilton of Texas and Cockrell
of Missouri.
When the Eastern delegates and friends
of the gold standard reach Chicago they
will find the silver men have absolute con
trol of the situation.
Conferences have been frequent daring
the day. Out of all this consultation but
one concrete fact seems to have been
evolved. The platform will be concise,
short and clear cut, without so much as
an ambiguous word that can be miscon
strued into meaning anything other than
an out and out declaration for the free and
unlimited coinage of silver at a ratio of 16
tol.
Senators Jones of Arkansas, Bate and
Harris of Tennessee, Blackburn of Ken
tucky, Tillman of South Carolina and
Cockrell of Missouri, Senator-elect Money
of Mississippi, Representative Richardson
of Tennessee and Hon. John R. McLean
have been in conference during the day,
and all are agreed that the financial plank
shall be given that prominence which its
importance demands, and that its text
shall be so short and its meaning so fixed
and determined that he who runs can
read it understandingly.
"Platitudes will tte eschewed by this
convention," said Senator Jones of Arkan
sas to-day. "The silver men represent
the plain people of the country, the think
ing masses, and our declaration will be
such that no man can jugg!e with its
meaning or seek to represent it as some
thing that it is not This convention is
to be run by the silver men ; we are in
control and everything that is done will
be by the consent of the majority only.
This situation might as well be accepted
by the minority at once. The minority
will be accorded all its rights and will be
part and parcel of the Democratic con
vention, but the voice of the majority is
the voice of the party in the convention."
When asked if he had any fear of the
delegates being weaned from their allegi
ance to silver, Mr. Jones replied with a
negative that was emphatic and con
vincing as to the sincerity of his own
views.
"If the gold men are hoping to be suc
cessful in proselyting among the silver
men," he continued, "it is high time they
understood the character of the timber of
which this convention will be constructed.
The delegates to the convention are men
who can neither be bought nor bulldozed.
They are rirm in the faith and nothing can
shake their loyalty to the cause which they
put above all other political questions.
Long months ago when we first organized
the silver movement in Washington we
took care to provide against such influ
ences, and wrote our people in every dis
trict to see that strong men were selected
as delegates."
While there seems to be no concentra
tion upon any one for temporary chair
man, the general opinion is that either
Senator Harris or Representative Richard
son, both of Tennessee, may be made
permanent chairman and that Senator
Blackburn of Kentucky may be tempo
rary chairman. All these gentlemen
are good parliamentarians, Mr. Harris
having been president pro tempore of the
Senate, Mr. Kichardson a frequent and ex
perienced occupant of the Speaker's chair
during the two terms of Speaker Crisp, and
Mr. Blackburn having frequently presided
over the Senate.
Concerning the report that the National
Committee intended to attempt to force a
gold standard man upon the convention
for temporary chairman Mr. Richardson
said to-day:
"Nothing of the kind will be done. Of
course, we recognize the fact that the
committee, as at present constituted, is
against silver, but the committee will be
very apt to remember, also, that the con
vention is largely the other way. If it de
cides by a majority vote to recommend to
the convention a gold man the minority
of the committee will offer a substitute
naming a eilver man. When the commit
tee makes its report to the convention this,
substitute will be offered, and a substitute
is always voted on first. The substitute
will be adopted, and if there is to be a
brush about this question it will be short
and quick and result in a sweeping vic
tory for the silver men."
Governor Altgeid's idea that the con
vention can complete its work in one day
is scouted by experienced politicians.
One of them said this afternoon that while
he was in favor of reasonable haste, he
recognized the fact that It required time to
carefully transact the business of a Na
tional Convention. The platform would
cause some debate, depending entirely
upon the pleasure of the convention, exer
cised through the gavel of the chairman.
It is not improbable that some prominent
person representing the gold side of the
question will be selected to antagonize tie
report of the committee on resolutions,
and with that single speech discussion
will end. This will be accomplished by a
motion from the floor demanding the
previous question, which will be promptly
put and carried.
While all reasonable expedition is de
sired by those having control, no one of
gooa judgment predicts less than a three
days' session.
GOLD AND SILVER MEN.
Chieftains of the Rival Factions
Lining Up In Chicago for the
Battle R jyal.
CHICAGO, 111., July 3.â The most at
tractive event of the day and the most
important from the standpoint of the
anti-free-silver members of the party as
sembled in the convention city was the
arrival of the advance quant from the
Eastern States, principally New York,
representing the nold-standari minority.
Their leader, towering in stature and in
fluence, was William C. Whitney. The
distinguished party arrived at the Audi
torium annex Hotel at the same time that
several other influential gold and silver
delegates and on-lookers were unloaded at
the Auditorium proper, and the scene in
the rotundas of both hotels was an ani
mated one until the guests scattered to
their rooms. At 5 o'clock the 'busload of
the Whitney party drew up in front of
the hotel, where the former Secretary of
the Navy has engaged almost the whole of
the parlor floor â Line bedrooms and six
parlors â for the cause of "sound money"
and the Democracy. In less than half an
hour Mr. Whitney reappeared in the ro
tunda. When asked if he had any state
ment to make to the press Mr. Whitney
said:
"I shall have nothing to say to-day in
the way of an interview. The fact is I
have not anything to add to what I said
for publication in New York on the issue
and the crisis before the party. I don't
know anything new to talk about because
I have been on a train for twenty-four
hours and have just got in to look over
the ground."
Then came Mr. Harrity, the National
Committee chairman, who greeted the
New York gentleman and said he was
Klad to see him in Chicago. Close behind
the Pennsylvania man walked the Presi
dential candidate from Kentucky, Senator
Blackburn, who added his welcoming
words. All tne members of the Whitney
party could not be accommodated at the
annex bo they were quartered at the main
hotel. These were James K. Martin and
ex-Mayor Hugh Grant of New York City.
Ex-Governor Flower, who came with the
party, went to the Palmer House. While
Mr. Whitney was at the elevator waiting to
go into conference witn Mr. Harrity and
others, he was greeted by Colonel S. W.
Fordyce, president of the Cotton Belt
Railroad, who forms one of the gold
standard contingent from Missouri. He
evidently came to the convention at the
request of Mr. Whitney, as he called to the
New Yorker while the car was being
started: "You sent for me and I came.
You see, I always come when you call me,
and I like to oblige my friends."
Senator Hill and ex-Governor Flower
went to the Palmar House, where the State
delegation as a body has a large parlor
reserved for its use as headquarters. Gov
ernor Flower discoursed at some length
upon the financial condition of the
country. He said that free silver was not
the cure for existing evils, but that re
striction of production by farmer and
manufacturer alike was necessary.
"The farmer," he asserted, <; needs above
all things else a short crop to enable him
to sell what he has at good prices. He
has had two or three crops now so bounti
ful that he could not well dispose of them
at remunerative rates. He is the last of
the row of bricks to be knocked down as
the result of the panic of 1893, and who
ever shall be elected President this year
there will be pood times, I believe, in 1897.
But not upon a free silver basis. Diluting
the currency will not restore the condi
tions of good and profitable business.
Credit is the stability and soundness of all
our money and must be maintained."
Governor Flower expressed the opinion
that if the Democratic Convention nomi
nated a candidate upon the free-silver
platform the Republican ticket would
carry New York by 250,000 majority.
"My own county of Jefferson," he said,
"which never, even in Fremont's days,
cave to exceed 3500 majority, will give
5000 to that ticket, I believe, and that is a
rural county, too."
The Governor's interesting talk was in
terrupted by a messenger who whispered
something in his ear which had the effect
of taking him out of the room with much
celerity and he was next heard from in
Senator Hill's room. A card sent to the
Senator wes returned with the statement
on its reverse side, "Just arrived; nothing
to say at the moment."
This afternoon a party of silver advo
cates consisting of Senator Stewart of Ne
vada, Representative Newlands of Nevada
and Hon. George C. Gorham, formerly Sec
retary of the United Btates Senate, called
upon Senators Jones and Cockrell at the
Sherman House to urge the nomination of
Senator Teller as the one man who could
solidify the forces of silver and make the
victory of that metal absolutely certain at
the coming election. So far as the expres
sions of the gentleman visited were con
cerned it is said the visit was not very sat
isfactory. Senators Dubois of Idaho, Petti
grew of North Dakota and Mantle of
Montana and Representative Hartman of
Montana, the bolting delegates from .the
St. Louis convention, have headquarters
at the Great Northern Hotel, whence they
are directing a very active canvass in be
half of Senator Teller. Senator Carter of
Montana is expected to arrive to-morrow.
"The report that Senator Teller had is
sued a letter to the effect that he would
not accept the nomination if it were ten
dered him was denied at the headquarters
during the afternoon, and is conclusively
disproved by the letter from the Senator
published by the United Press.
Mr. Newlands, the silvente Representa
tive from Nevada, is exhibiting to his sil
ver Democratic friends a tabulation as fol
lows: Democratic vote in 1892, 5,600,000;
Democratic vote in the hopelessly cold
States of New York, New England, New
Jersey and Pennsylvania, 1,600,000; Demo
cratic vote in Populist States of the West,
250,000. This leaves a to al of 3,750,000.
Deduct for the Democratic gold vote 20
per cent (750,000) and toe aggregate Demo
cratic tilver vote pledged to tne silver
ticket to be nominated at Chicago amounts
to but 3,000,000. If the silver Democrats
will accept the com burnt ion now offered
by the Teller boomers Newlands pledges
them the following votes: Populist and
silverit* vote on the basis of the vote of
1894, 2,000,000; free-silver Republican vote,
1,000,000; independent vote of organized
labor, 500,000; total for the Teller candi
dacy, 3,500,000; grand total for the ticket
if Teller is namei, 6,500,000.
Ex-Senator Walsh of Georgia has been
in the city tat some days, he bMng one of
the delegates at large from his State to the
Democratic National Convention. A re
porter of the United Press called upon
him to-day at bis hotel in order to obtain,
if possible, his views upon the political
situation. At first he was disinclined to
say anything for publication, but he finally
consented to give his views, and dictated
the following statement:
"It is pretty well understood," he said,
â¢'that the si'ver forces are determined to
organize the convention. This means
that the temporary and permanent organi
zation will be in the hands of the silver
men. As to the Presidential nomination,
it is not well defined. Mr. Bland seems to
be well in the lead, starting off with the
States of Missouri, Arkansas and Texas
commitied to him. The boom for Gov
ernor Boies does not so far seem to be
effective in securing any decided acces
sions for his candidacy.
"There is a strong undercurrent for Sen
ator Teller as the logical candidate of the
situation. His name is being favorably
presented by prominent Southern Demo
crats. It is urged agai ist him that he is
not a Democrat, and this fact mitigates
against his availability. On the other
band, it is claimed he is the embodiment
of the free-silver clause and that he repre
sents in the most forceful degree the vital
principle of home rule, or local self-gov
ernment. In retiring from the Republi
can convention he exhibited the courage
of his convictions and gave the highest
evidence of devotion a cause to the
triumph of which he believes to be of para
mount interest to the welfare of the peo
ple. His advocates assert that the present
13 an abnormal period in the history of
American politics and that it pre
sents an opportunity for the Demo
catic party to gather within
its fold the Populists and the
free-silver Republicans. They claim his
nomination will bridge the way into the
Democratic fold, and that if he is made
the nominee of the party his election will
be a certainty. The South can furnish 142
electoral votes. Eighty votes more are
necessary to secure the Presidential elec
tion for the candidate of this convention.
Teller's friends affirm in the most positive
manner that if nominated he will carry
every State west of the Missouri and in
addition the States of Indiana, Illinois,
lowa and Michigan. But they are not
confident that these four States can be car
ried for a Democrat. While the leaders in
the Northwest will advocate the nomina
tion and election of a free-silver Democrat
for President, tney doubt their ability to
carry with them the rank and file of the
free-silver Republicans and of the Popu
lists. They assert, however, that with
Teller as the nominee all obstacles would
be removed and all Populists and free
silver Republicans would unite most cor
dially with the Democrats in securing his
election. With Teller aB a leader and a
standard-bearer these men would find no
difficulty in passing over to thÂ« Demo
cratic camp.
"The prominent Southern Democrats
who have been on the grounds for weeks are
carefully considering the situation. The
arguments in favor of Senator Teller's
nomination are listened to with respectful
attention and are given earnest considera
tion. If there was any certainty tt.at a
Democrat could be elected President, Sen
ator Teller would not be seriously consid
ered. The convention cannot afford to
nominate a man who will be defeated.
"Democratic leaders are deeply im
pressed by the presentation made in be
half of Senator Teller and they are giving
the most serious consideration to the
availability of his candidacy in the event
of their becoming satisfied that a Demo
crat cannot be elected. His nomination
will mean that he and his free-silver sup
porters have quit the Republican party
forever. It is confidently asserted that
the amalgamation of the free-silver Re
publicans and the Populists with the
Democrats would cement the union be
tween the great producing sections of the
South and West and would result in
Democratic control of the Federal Govern
ment for a long period of time."
The Missouri delegation of anti-free
silver Democrats, led by ex-Governor
David R. Francis, arrived in town during
the day about a score strong, most of them
being residents of St. Louis. Among them
are Judge Thayer, Justice T. Blair, J. G.
James. A. Siddon, F. W. Lehman and
Colonel S. W. Fordyce. Frank K. Ryan
came with the party, but he is a 16 to 1
advocate, ana wiil be on the floor of the
convention voting for silver and Bland.
Francis, who has been the particular
object of attack by the Missouri free-silver
majority, said to a United Press reporter
after he and his colleagues from that State
bad called to pay their respects to the
Whitney party: "I am a Democrat and
expect to remain one, but as I am against
the 16 to 1 idea I am in Chicago only as an
onlooker. If 1 can be of any service to the
sound-money workers I am here to render
It. Ido not believe m this bolting idea,
and don't believe there is going to be any.
It looks as though the silver men were set
upon running the convention to suit them
selves regardless of party precedent, pre
rogative or principles."
Senator Vest, accompanied by a 'bus
load of fellow-Missourians, arrived at the
Auditorium in the afternoon. He was met
by Colonel Prather, the National Commit
teeman from his State. Just prior to Sen
ator Vest's arrival President Cleveland's
former Postmaster-General, the Hon. Don
M. Dickinson, the leader of the Michigan
gold forces, inscribed his name on the
Auditorium register. Other prominent
arrivals were United States Senator Walt
hall of Mississippi, who said his State and
others soutn of the line were for free silver
and any good man for President who was
for silver; National Committeeman James
A. Wood of South Dakota, Frederick B.
Holman of Oreeon, who holds the proxy
of National Committeeman E. B. McKee
of that State, and eight members of the
Alabama delegation, the latter going to
the Auditorium.

SILVER MEN CONFER.
Delegates Representing Many
Spates Meet and Discutss a Plan
of Procedure.
CHICAGO, 111., July 3.â A conference
of silver delegates, numbering seventy
five and representing nearly every State
that sends silver delegates to the National
Convention, was held at the Sherman
House to-night. The meeting was called
to order by Senator Harris of Tennessee
at 8:15 o'clock and adjourned at 10:45.
T. O. Towles, the secretary of the Bi
metallic League, as secretary of the con
ference, on motion of L. L. Haines of
Idaho, called the roll by States and a
number of States not represented at the
former conference held earlier in the week
responded.
Senator Jones of Arkansas', chairman of
the steering committee of five appointed
at tne first conference, reported the result
of their interview with the ezecntive com
mittee of the National Democratic Com
mittee. This interview, he stated, had
not been entirely satisfactory and the
committee would have a further confer
ence with the National Committee.
Senator Jones stated that, in his opin
ion, it was important that all silver dele
gates and their city addresses should be
known, so that if at any time it was
thought necessary to call them together
this could be readily done. The suggestion
was well received and on the roll being
called the following responded: Alabama,
John W. Tomiinson; Arkansas, J. T. Gil
lar; California, W. B. Burke; Colorado,
Thomas O'Donnell; Georgia, Patrick
Walsh; Idaho, L. L. Haines; lowa, C. A.
Walsh; Kansas, David Overmeyer; Ken
tucky, J. C. S. Blackburn; Michigan, G. P.
Hunimei; Mississippi, H. D. Money;
Missouri, A. E. de Armond; Montana, W.
A. Clark; Nebraska, C. J. Smith; North
Carolina, T. J. Jarvis; Oregon, Dr. Mulli
neux, South Carolina, B. R. Tili
rnan; Tennessee, Joseph O. Richard
son; Virginia. P. J. Otey; Washing
ton, W. H. White; Wyoming, J.
Jfi. Osborne; Arizona, Wylie Jones;
Oklahoma, E. S. Mitchell; Utah, O. W.
Powers; Indian Territory, R. L. Olen;
District of Columbia, John Boyle.
Mr. O'Donnell of Colorado, in the course
of a speech urging the importance of the
silver men securing the temorary organi
zation, suggested the name of C. S. Thomas
of his State as temporary chairman. He
created great enthusiasm by saying that
he and the Western silver men wanted a
silver man nominated by silver votes and
not by the votes of the gold bug delegates.
He had an intimation, he eaid, that the
gold men might throw their votes in a
body for some silver man, and, no matter
how good a silver man be might be, nomi
nated by such votes, he would be "queered"
with silver voters. He wanted the silver
men to get together and agree on a candi
date, and then go into the convention and
nominate him by a solid silver vote. This
idea was taken up, and gave rise to quite a
discussion as to how the end suggested
could be accomplished.
The small room in which the conference
met was crowded to suffocation. Con
gressman Swanson of Virginia advocated
a general conference of all silver delegates
unless the committee of which Senator
Jones was chairman could come to some
agreement with the National Committee
as to the temporary chairmanship. He
said it was not certain as yet but that the
silver men would have a majority in the
National Convention and could name the
chairman. But if this were not the case
then the silver minority of the National
Committee could make a minority report
naming a silver man, and this man should
be selected by a general conference of the
silver delegates, and there was not space
enough in the present room to seat them.
A delegate stated with treat emphasis
that a hall large enough to accommodate
all silver delegates had been secured.
When asked to name the hall he evaded
reply.
Senator Tillman of South Carolina said
it was essential to success to have a thor
ough organization, and this organization
could only be had by a conference of all
the delegates who believed in the silver
cause, and he wanted to have the present
conference adjourn to such a hall, After
further discussion it was decided that all
the members of delegations named, with
such others as were in the city at the time,
should call at the Sherman House on
Monday at 2 p. m.
At that hour the committee of which
Senator Jones is chairman would know
the result of the action of the National
Committee, which meets at 10 a. m. Mon
day. If this action should not be satis
factory, then Senator Jones' advice as to
whether a general conference of all silver
men should be called or only a conference
of the chairman of each silver delegation
to select a temporary chairman to be
named in opposition to the National Com
mittee's choice, will be announced.
Senator Jonas read a telegram from P.
B. Winston of Minnesota, amid great ap^
plause, which stated tnat on Monday the
Minnesota delegation would arrive and in
it would be found steven silver menALL DEMOCRATIC

SENTIMENT FOR BLAND.
Congressman Maguire Tells Why
the Missouri Statesman
Is Favcred.
WAS A CALIFORNIA PIONEER.
During the Ear y Days "Silver Dick"
Sought Gold Up in Amador
County.
GREEN RIVER, Wto., July 3.â The
Utah and Idano delegation joined us a
Ogden. This is now a thoroughly Demo
cratic train in everything but its luxurious
appointments.
All who speak are for silver, and there is
a growing sentiment in favor of Bland fi>r
President. Caminetti and I have been for
him from the beginning. Rawlins of
Utah, who served with us in tbe Fifty
third Congress, announced himself for
Bland also. He is the logical candidate.
For twenty years he has been the foremost
Democratic leader of the silver fight. The
record of his work in Congress is in a large
part the history of the free coinage move
ment. Why should not the issue and the
man whose name has become synonymous
with it be presented together?
It is urged that he is not sufficiently
aristocratic in his appearance and habits.
1 admit that he would not cut as striking
a figure on dress parade or at a gathering
of New York's 490 as some of his critics
would, but he is a grand, honest, rugged,
broad-minded, large-hearted man of the
people. He is a typical Democrat in the
truest sense of the term.
In addition to all this he was a Cali
fornia pioneer and has a warm place in
his heart for our State and her people.
M. Caminetti says:
"Bland is my tirst choice, and I will
support him in the delegation, but I will
vote for any silver Democrat that the
delegation may agree upon. It seems to
me that Bland is the ideal candidate at
this time. He is a man of the highest
personal character, and tne whole coun
try knows his devotion to the silver cause.
Like yourself I am strongly influenced to
support Biand by my personal friendship
for him; but independently of that I
think nim not only one of the best, but
also as the very strongest of the candi
dates before the people. The fact that
Bland lived at Volcano in my county
(Amador) and was a pioneer miner there
is not to be forgotten. Boies is my second
choice, and his silver record is undoubt
edly satisfactory to the whole country.
His came would also be a silver plat
form."
Most of the other delegates are strong
ior silver and will vote for it, but, as to
candidates they are non-committal. They
cannot, however, conceal the growing
feeling that Bland is the man of the
hour
Harry Wise says: "I am in favor of
nominating a strong, conservative man.
Of course I want him to be a man who can
be relied upon to faithfully execute tbe
pledges of the platform. My present choice
among the prominent and available candi
dates is Stevenson."
W. W. Foote will probably be elected
chairman of tbe delegation. An informal
understanding to that effect was reached
this morning. James G. Maguire.
SILVER REPUBLICANS.
Clubs to Be Organized In Kansas
to Champion the White Metal
In the Campaign.
TOPEKA, Kaxs., July 3.â A movement
his been organized here to establish free
silver Republican clubs in all parts of
Kansas, to be known as the "Republican
Silver League." Two hundred Republi
cans of this city have subscribed to tne
tution of the league, which requires
applicants for membership to be former
Republicans, Populists and Democrats not
being admitted. The constitution de
clares that "We are in favor.of the free
coinage of both gold and silver at tne rate
is of 16 to 1", and without asking the permis
sion of any other nation on the face of the
globe."
Organizers are to be put in the field at
once. In Topeka a hail is to be secured
as a permanent home for the league,
where the silver question will be discussed
at regular intervals during the campaign,
and where free silver literature is to be
provided for distribution.
WITH PATRIOTIC WORDS.
Major McKinley Addresses a Dele-
gation of Wage-Earners Who
Call at Canton.
CANTON, Ohio, July 3.â lt was an inter
esting delegation of wage-earners from
Tuscarawas County, numbering about
1000, that called on Major McKinley this
afternoon. They came with flags flying,
dr.ims rolling and bands playing.
In the midst of the procession was borne
aloft a huge sheet ol American bright tin
plate manufactured by one of the mills at
Cantledover. It is the largest sheet of tin
plate ever made in the United States,
its dimensions being 30x144 inches.
Major McKinley was greeted with pro
longed cheering, and in addressing the
crowd said:
"This assemblage is fairly typical ol our
American communities, and it fitly repre
!-ents the varied occupations of the Ameri
can people. You are here not for curiosity
nor from any considerations at all ner
sonal, but you are here because in your
hearts you believe in the great funda
mental doctrines of the Republican
party. [Loud applause.] You believe
that these principles are best for
you when put into practical legislation
and administration. You believe these
principles will secure to all the people the
largest measure of good times, and you
believe that because you recall that for
more than a third of a century those
great Republican principles designated
legislation and administration in this
country, and that during all that period
you have enjoyed exceptional prosperity.
"Here in this country we aie all de
pendent upon each other, no matter what
our occupations may be. All of us want
good times, good wages, good prices, good
markets, and then we want good money
always. When we give a good day's work to
our employer we want to be paid in good
sound dollars, worth 100 cents and no less.
Now whatever policy will bring us back to
these good times is the one that the great
majority of the American people are in
favor of and will so register their votes at
the coming election, and you seem to have
made up your minds what that policy is.
"What I want to see in this country is a
return to that prosperity which we en
joyed for so many years. [Loud and
continued applause.] What 1 want is
to see idle men at work and
at American wages [loud applause], and
the more men you put at work at good
American wages the better markets will
the farmers have and the better prices
will they get for their products."
A delegation of 100 colored men from
Massillon and Stark County called on the
major at 10 o'clock to-night, and were ad
dressed by him. His "address was an
eulogy of Lincoln and his work for the
colored race. He concluded by raying:
"I know you love the great cardinal
principles of the Republican party [a voice,
'You bet your life'], and I am very sure
you will be found at all times standing for
the best things in the Governmentâ that
which will secure the greatest good to the
greatest number." [Applause.]

BROWN WORKS CLOSED,

at Cleveland Without
Bloodshed.
Eugene Debs Is Asked to Deliver an
Oration Over the Grave of
a Striker.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, July 3.â The; sit
uation at the Brown Hoist Works had an
ominous look this morning. Men gathered
on the corners discussing the killing of
William Rettger. A sin le shot would very
likely have precipitated a bloody riot at
any moment. Tne police were keenly
alive to the gravity of the situation. As
the non-union men got off the cars at the
works they were greeted with cries of
"Scab!" "Scab!" but no violence was of
fered. By actual count seventy -five men
entered the works and forty-five police
men were on guard. Company F and
Company B of the Fifth Regiment
were quartered downtown under "ru-h"
orders, every man having twenty rounds
of ammunition.
As was anticipated by the strikers at
noon the Brown Hoisting Company paid
off the seventy-two men employed by them
and closed the works, saying they would
open Monday wiih 250 men. This, the
strikers say, means that they will not re
open at all.
The funeral of William Rettger, who
was killed yesterday, will be held to-mor
row. Eugene V. Debs has been asked to
deliver the funeral oration.
Albert G. Sauuders, who shot Rettger, is
in a critical condition. He was released
on $10,000 bail. His nose is broken, and
his jaw and body are terribly bruised. One
ear was torn nearly off. The doctors are
doubtful of his recovery.

ANTI-SILVER MEN
WILL NOT BOLT,
Scenes at St. Louis Will
Not Find a Counter
part at Chicago.
GOLD MEN TO PROTEST.
But They Do Not Intend to
Withdraw From the Na
tional Convention.
KEEPING THE PARTY INTACT.
First S?rious Break in the Ranks of
White-Metal Champions Started
by Indiana.
CHICAGO, 111., July 3.â lt is positively
stated that the anti-silver men will not
imitate the example of the silver men in
St. Louis and bolt (be convention when
their wishes with regard to the platform
are disregarded, as they are sure to be.
The so-called sound-money men, the
"wise men of the East," as the silver men
have jocularly named them, believe in the
efficacy of the machine in politics and the
necessity of keeping the organization in
tact for the coming campaign. While it
is understood that no bolt will be counten
anced, this is not tantamount to a declara
tion that the gold men will permit the con
vention to go for free silver without objec
tion. A dignified and emphatic protest
will be made against the course the ma
jority are bent upon taking, but after they
have carried the day the gold leaders who
diaaKree with them, it is said, will accept
the ticket and the platform, and the
scenes at St. Louis will find no counter
part at Chicago.
It is also given out to-night from a free
silver source of prominence that the gold
delegation from Michigan will be un
seated, earlier counsels to the contrary
notwithstanding. There has likewise been
developed a concentration of sentiment in
a number of the delegation favorable to
the selection of W. J. Bryan, editor of the
Omaha World-Herald, for temporary chair
man.
The first serious break in the ranks of
the silver men occurred to-night at a
meeting of the Indiana delegation. They
voted not to go into the caucus on Mon
day. Some of Mr. Bland's friends visited
Indiana headquarters this afternoon and
urged the Hooaier delegates to attend the
caucus.
After they had gone, at the request of
several members of the delegation Senator
Turpie, the chairman, issued a call for the
meeting. John Lamb of Terre Haute who,
as alternate-at-large, will occupy the seat
of Senator Voorhees, detained at home by
illness, introduced the following resolu
tion:
Resolved, That the delegation from Indiana
believe that the nominee of this convention
ought to be named by the convention, and we
decline to attend or be bound by the action of
any caucus or conference called lor that pur
pose.
This precipitated the liveliest kind of a
debate, lasting over an hour. The pass
age of this resolution was urged by T.
Lamb, W. E. English, of the Inuianapolis
delegation, and Judge McCabe of the Wil
liamsport District. They took the ground
that the proposed action was in violation
of all precedent and so un- Democratic that
not even the abnormal conditions under
whicb the convention would meet justified
such a radical departure.
Although the Indiana delegation num
bers twenty-six silver men to four gold
men the arguments in favor of the resolu
tion caused many of the twenty-six to look
favorably upon it, and when Senator Tur
pie, the head of the delegation and an
ardent silver man, advocated its passage
the scales turned in its favor, and it was
passed by a small majority. The exact
figures wore not given, for afterward the
opponents of the proposition withdrew
their opposition and the vote was made
unanimous.
THE HENLEY REGATTA.
Yale's Crew Develop a Rapid
Stroke in Their Practice
on the Thames.
Many Mascots Sent 1h m, Including
the Left Hind Foot of a Grave
yard Rabbit
HENLEY, Eng., July 3.â The Yale crew
were out on the Thames at 11:45 o'clock
this forenoon and rowed down the river,
making several short stretches at a stroke
of from 38 to 40. The men were in their
old boat, as the new one was undergoing
alterations in rigging. The crew were not
timed in their work this morning.
Crowds are gathering rapidly, and the
number of houseboats and launches along
the course is increasing very fast.
The Yale men to-day received a message
conveying the best wishes of the Harvard
crew of '86 for their success in the race for
the grand challenge cup. The crew has
aiso received a large number of luck
tokens, the four-leaf clover predominat
ing. Among the many offerings of this
character is the left hind toot of a grave
yard rabbit, which has been carried by the
Yale coxswain in the Yale-Harvard races
for the last four years.
AN EXPERT'S CRITICISM.
Row Well, Except That They lilt the
.;*â ; Water in Feathering.
LONDON, Eng., July 3.â Mr. Ellington,
the rowing expert of the Field, telegraphs
to the United Press from Henley as
follows:
"The Yale crew were out this morning
in their new boat. They rowed well, ex
cept that they hit the water in feathering.
They showed marked improvement, but
they have only rowed a fast stroke for two
days."
The Cains College four, while at practice
this morning, ran into the boat of Dr.
McDowell of Chicago, who was on the
wrong side of Temple Island. The dam
age is not so serious but that it can be re
paired in time for the doctor to take part
IB the event for which He is enteredâ the
race for the diamond scullsâ and he wiil
be one of the contestants. Dr. McDowell
was out for practice this afternoon, rowing
in a boat which be had, borrowed and
which he will use while his own is under
going repairs.

STOCKTON, Cal.. July 3.â Athletes are
beginning to gather here. Robert Edgren
arrived from Sacramento to-day, and
Keeler of the Academic League appeared
upon the scene early, to make arrance
ment3 for his team, wnich is coming by
boat in the morning. The grounds are in
perfect condition for the field day. The
bicycle races will be run first, so the track
will not be cut up by the spikes of the
sprinters.
There will be two bicycle events, one a
mile scratch race, in which Ed Fisher,
S. R. C. ; F. H. Tretheway, T. C. W. ; J. S.
Seybold, 8. R. C; T. K. McCuen, S. R. CL;

odds are in Maxwell's favor. Of course
everybody wants to see Sharkey spar, and

banks with several thousands of specta
tors. Great disappointment is manifested
here at the failure of the South End crew
to enter against the Giants of Stockton.
They promised to send a crew, but instead
entered a crew in the intermediate class,
and every one here feels that they are
afraid of the six-footers from Stockton.
There will be a parade herein the. morn

RIVERS INLET STRIKE.
Authorities Fear That the Disgruntled
Salmon-Catchers Are Plotting
Mischief.
VICTORIA, B. C, July 3.â The fisher
men's strike at Rivers Inlet, 200 miles
south of Skeena River, where five of the
largest canneries in British Columbia are
bituated, promises to seriously interfere
with the season's salmon pack, and threat *
ens. much trouble for police authorities
here. The steamer Chieftain is nuw on
the Sound seeking men to take the place
of the strikers, as fish are running well at
Rivers Inlet, and every day lost means
great expense to tl c cannery men.
Last year the cannera at the inlet paid 7
cents per fish to the Skeena fishermen
and this they were paying this year, but
7 cents a fish has been unsatisfactory to
the fisherman since the big strike on the
Skeena declared a month or so ago and
they now demand a 10-cent rate. There
are 1500 strikers, of whom two-thirds are
Indians, tne others being a mixed class of
whites. They went on a strike two weeks
ago and since then fishing operations
have been suspended.
Tne strike is supposed to have been
brought about at the instigation of some
of the Columbia River or Skeena River
agitators.
After it was declared a number of Nor
wegian colonists at Bella Colla were en
gaged, but no sooner bad they begun to
fish than they received a threatening noti
fication from" an Indian cnief to desist,
which they complied with.
The Indians packed their effects last
Monday, and manning tneir canoes left
port in a fleet of over 100 sails. No one
knows exactly where they are destined,
but those familiar with their ways believe
this move is but a "bluff."
They are likely to be gathered in some
secluded bay or inlet, considering a plan
of action, and trouble is expected.
A posse of special constables was sent
north on the Danube on Wednesday even
ing. To-day, upon the return of the Do
minion Government steamer Quadra from
the west coast, orders were given for it to
go northward immediately. Although it
is announced in official circles that the
Quadra is not to take a hand in the strike,
it is not denied that it is bound for Rivers
Inlet.

Dunn, father of little Eva and Walter
Dunn, aguin.st the president and trustees

to be a model of its class. The order re
cites that the management shall produce
Dunn's children in court and show cause
why they should not be returned to their
father.
The complaint states that tbe children
are.held in duress and tnat the father has

cruel and inbuman in their treatment
of the children.
SOCIAL LIONS CLASH.
Street FUjht Between Two of the Angel
Citij'H Four Hundred.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., July 3.â An ex
citing fiHio encounter took place on Spring
' street at noon to-day between young men
:of the local Four Hundred. The combat
ants were O. W. Childs Jr., an neir to the
| great Childs estate on South Main street,
I and W. L. Hastings, a stockbroker and
one of the ultra-fashionable young men
of the town.
Bad blood has existed between the pair
for some time, and generally they did not
deign to speak as they passed by. They
| met to-day in front of the Hollenbeck
j Hotel. An insulting remark was uttered
by Hastings, and in two seconds they were
at it hammer and tongs. Childs was the
aggressor, and he soon proved to bis ad
versary that he had not neglected the
manly art in his system of physical cul,
j ture.
The street was thronged by pedestrians
at the time and a great, crowd soon gath
ered and took much delight in witnessing
| tne give-and-take contest.
The second blow from Hastings brought
claret from Childs' lower lip. Childs tben
planted his right over Hastings' left eye,
and but for a friendly barber-pole wonkl
have sent the man of stocks to grass.
Friends stopped the scrimmage.
A misunderstanding about the sale of
some stocks was the immediate cause of
the trouble.
PURE MILK CRUSADE.
Fifty-seven Dealers Arrested for Violat
ing City Ordinances.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., July 3.â The
Dockery of Los Angeles, Milk Inspector
Blackinton, is aroused at last. He swears
by the Pleiades "milky whey" and the
planet Jupiter that henceforth the milk
men of this city and vicinity must obey
all the ordinances regulating their busi
ness.
A new ordinance provides that milkmen
shall register at the Health Office and ob
tain a permit, besides the regular license,
before commencing business. This is to
enable the Health Department to find the
milkmen and keep them under the regu
lations.
The milkmen have evaded the duty, and
a fine of $2 recently imposed on one of
them by Justice Morrison has been too
small to serve as an example. To-day
day Inspector Blackinton swore out com
plaints against fifty-seven milkmen for
non-compliance with the order. He says
it will cost them more than $2 this time.

that bank and Detective Francis H. Steele,
claiming $50,000 damages for false arrest
and imprisonment.
KILLED ON A MOISE FARM.
An Employe Impaled on aline of a
Large Fork.
BOISE. Idaho, July 3.â William Kern,
employed on the ranch of H. G. Wiison,
three miles from here, was to-day im
paled on a tine of a forty-pound fork used
by means of a derrick to hoist hay from
wagons to the top of stacks. The tine en
tered just back of the lei't shoulder blade,
near the heart. Kern lived about ten
minutes.
The accident was caused by the break
ing of a pulley attached to a beam over
the stack. The heavy fork dropped about
four feet before it struck Kern, who was
stooping over. The force of the blow
brought him to his knees. The men be
low saw he was hurt, and hastily ascended
the stack to his assistance. "Hurry up,"
said Kern, as they approached.
When the tine, which had penetrated
the body almost a foot without protrua
ine, was pulled out, the internal flow of
blood could be distinctly heard by those
standing near. The gurgling sound
lasted a few seconds when Kern, in re
sponse to a suggestion that he be removed
from the stack, said: "Let me rest a
minute." He sank, and in a lew moments
was dead.
A FREE COINAGE
BANK PRESIDENT.
William P. St. John Has
Been Compelled to
Resign.
HIS OUTSPOKEN VIEWS.
Only Prominent Financier in the
East Openly Fighting for
Silver.
QUOTED ALL OVER THE WEST.
Suggested as an Acceptable Candidate
for President of the United
States.
NEW YORK, N. V., July 3.â The fol
lowing statement was given out at tbe
Mercantile National Bank this afternoon:
William P. St. John has resigned the presi
dency of the Mercantile National Bank. For
several years Mr. St. John has outspoklngly
advocated the free coinage of silver. Recently
the feeling In banking circles against a bank
president advocating free silver has been mani
fest. The matter was brought to an issue this
morning at a meeting of the board by his
reading a letter from one of the directors, of
which the following is an extract:
"Dear Mr. St. John: I have just heard that yon
intend to take part in the Silver Convention at
Chicago. You are under obligations not to do
so, is my belief. â¢ â¢ â¢ I admit that the posi
tion you hold gives you power before a conven
tion, but you ought not to go when you know
your board is against your views, as well as all
money-centers. lam y oar friend."
Mr. St. John was recently requested by reso
lution at a mass-meeting held in this city to
attend the National Democratic Convention
and urge the incorporation of certain pream
bles and demands into the platform of the Na
tional Democracy. The first of these demands
is independent and unlimited free coinage of
silver at 16 to 1.
Mr. St. John resigned his office of president
of the Mercantile National Bank because a
majority of his directors thought his com
pliance with that request would be harmful to
the bank. The board accepted his resignation
with a unanimous expression of regret.
The Mercantile National Bank is at 191
Broadway, and is one of the best known banks
in the city. Mr. St. John has been especially
noted as practically the only financier of
prominence in the East who openly favored
the free coinage of silver at the ratio of 16 to 1.
He was the only free silver New York City
bank and as such his sayings and
writings have been quoted all over the West.
A few months ago a Denver newspaper sug
gested him as an acceptable free silver can
didate for President of the United States.
HAIL! SAN DIEGO'S QUEEN
Caroline the Fair Will Rule
in State on the Bay
Tc-Night.
A Par&de of Thousands of Cyclists
Opens the Midsummer
Carnival.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., July 3.â Crowds are
coming into the city to attend the water
carnival. For the first time in San Diego's
history a real, live queen will rule, and
she is a pretty one, too. Caroline Pol
hamus is her name on common occasions,
but during tfie carnival she wiil be called
her Majesty, and she will wear robes to
morrow ni'.iht worthy of her station. Her
barge will appear as of beaten gold, and it
will be illumined on the water by hun
dreds of colored electric lights, manu
factured on board.
The young Queen will be attended by a
score of maids and youths, attired in the
court costume of old Versailles., and a
young page will wield a big peacock-plume
fan to waft the plebeian firecracker smoke
from the face of the ruler.
The procession of pleasure craft, all
brilliantly lighted and decorated, will be
over two miles long. It will wind upon
the glassy waters of the bay in spirals of
beautiful colors.
To-night the illumination bicycle lan
tern parade drew thousands out of doors.
Like all nights under San Diego skies, it
was balmy and full of the romance that
hangs over the land. Thousands of
wheels, adorned by Japanese lanterns,
flowers and nags, moved in procession
through the streets, preceded by galloping
policemen and the Guard band of thirty
pieces, playing such patriotic airs as "The
Star - Spangled Banner," "Dixie" and
"Yankee Doodle."
Girls as well as boys participated in the
parade. They were clad in red, white and
blue gowns, and they pedaled upon won
derful machines, appearing to be moving
bouquets and electric lights. All this was
accompanied by the bluster of bombs, the
swishing of rockets hurling toward tbe
empyrean, and the wail of the small boy
I making his tirst, acquaintance with the mi
i flammatory cracker.
All the streets are garbed as on a fete
day in Southern France. The doors, win
dows and facades are draped with colors
and hung with lanterns.

BUSTLING WITH LIFE.

VISITOES BEGIN TO ARRIVE.

Grounds of Sloat.
MONTEREY, Cal., July 3.â ln every
body's mouth, even in the strangers',
whose presence seems an obtrusion upon
the dreary life of Monterey, is the Spanish
word, "manana." It is a word of peculiar
significance to the Spanish people, this
"manana," and, indeed, to the Americans
who understand it, for it means "to-mor
row."
And this is the eve of a celebration
which for absolute uniqueness stands
alone, out and above all the festivities of
the year in California; for to-morrow
marks tbe beginning of the wonderful
commemoration of California's jubileeâ
her golden jubilee of that day
fifty years ago when she came under
the protection of the United States of
America, and the stars and stripes was
first her flag. The celebration is to last
for three days. Perhaps this is after
the good old Spanish custom of
making merry at fiestas for days
and nights at a time; anyhow, the
calendar itself has conspired toward this
end, for July 4 comes opportunely after
fifty years to open festivities that will run
without intermission until the night of
the 7th.
That nothing may be left undone this
evening in the way of preparation there
are on all sides evidences of activity â a
strange and disturbing bustle, be it said,
for this town of manana, and the old people
look on in something akin to astonish
ment at the hurry of decorators, painters,
carpenters, street-repairers and the ladies
themselves, who are busy over a hundred j
and one things.
The spirit of Sloat and his patriotic band
who hoisted the Stars and Stripes half a
century ago where the flag of Spain used
to float possesses the people to-day, and
the result is a remarkable change in the
appearance of Monterey.
Bunting and wreaths and flowers sprang i
up like magic. The principal streets are I
bedecked in tri-color streamers and green
garlands so profusely that they give the
idea of a riot of colors, a fluttering mass
of brilliant hues.
Among the chief features of to-day's
additional decorations were two arches
now in course of construction. One of
these will span Alvarado street at Pearl,
and another will stand at the corner of
Franklin and Scott streets.
Each consists of two stately pillars about
twenty feet high, supporting a cross-beam
that is elegantly draped and festooned.
Flags surmount each column and an
abundance of wreaths complete the effect
iveness of the whole.
Colton Hall, in which was held the first
Legislature of California, was decorated
very appropriately with the National
colors, which gave it a stately grandeur
in its old age.
Several of the historic adobe buildings
have been clad in colors that perhaps they
never saw before, and the odd stones on
Alvarado street, that had not before been
dressed in honor of the jubilee, were gayiy
decorated.
It may be Baid that now, from the old
Mexican jail at the plaza to the Mexican
Castom-houae on the bay, Monterey is lit
erally red, white and blue, with a back
ground of darK adobe and gray dust.
The town began to receive visitors to
day in generous numbers. They roamed
over its streets and plazas and among the
quaint adobe buildings.
Many visited Pacific Grove during the
day. All found amusement and instruc
tion here, for to whomisthi." historic spot,
made famous by Sloat, not of interest?
SAN JOSE DAMAGE SUIT,
Corwin C. Ingels Brings Action
for $75,000 Against the
Southern Pacific.
Sustained Injuries in the Santa Clara
Wreck Which Made Him an
Invalid for Life.
SAN JOSE, Cal., July 3.â Corwin C.
Ingels, a farmer near Gilroy, began a suit
in the Superior Court to-day against the
Southern Pacific Railroad Company for
$75,000 damages for injuries received in the
collision between the broad and narrow
gauge passenger trains at Santa Clara on
January 25 last.
Ingels was a passenger on the broad
gauge train running between San Fran
cisco and this city. He alleges that in the
collision he received such injuries to his
spinal column as to wholly incapacitate
him from attending to his business.
He alleges he will suffer great physical
and mental pain the balance of his life,
and lose ail the pleasure and enjoyment
of living.
Ingels was confined to his bed for
twenty-one weeks and incurred an indebt
edness of $280 for medical and surgical
treatment, restitution fcr which he also
asks, mating a total of $75,280. The col
lision is attributed to negligence on the
part of the management of the two roads.
FAT HOLDS THE SEAT.
J.'rmainn in thm City Council Pending the
lie mlt of an Appeal.
SAN JOSE, Cal., July 3.â Judge Lorigan
this morning retused to make an order
allowing Homer Prindle to hold his seat in
the Common Council pending an appeal
to the Supreme Court on the decision in
the election contest case giving J. P. Fay
the seat in the Council from the Second
Ward.
Judge Lorinan refused to rule in the
matter, saying that the recount showed
that Prindle had never been elected and
therefore had no title to the seat. The
court said that no statement would be
made as to what action would be taKen by
tbe court should Prindle disregard tbe
order giving Fay the seat in the Council,
but if contempt of court was committed
the court would deal with it. Fay will
hold the seat in the Council pending the
appeal unless the Supreme Court makes
an order restraining him.

the expressman who was arrested a few
days ago on a charge of insanity preferred
by his wife, was released from the County
Jail this morning. An investigation
showed Nash to be perfectly sane. Nash's

DUNHAM OR HIS SHADOW
Photographs of a North Dakota
Captive Sent to San
Jose Officers.
Detective Bellis Confident That He
Has Caught the Campbells
Batcher.
SAN JOSS, Cal., July 3.â Sheriff Lyn
don to-day received from George Bellis,
a detective of Fargo, N. D., two pictures
of a man giving the name of George Dai
! ton, whom Bellis arrested about a week
j ago on suspicion of being James C. Dun
ham, the Campbells murderer. About a
week ago Sheriff Lyndon received a tele
gram from Bellis saying that he had Dun
bam and asking that a man be sent to
Fart; o to identify him. Bellis is sure he
has Dunham, as the man's appearance
tallies exactly with the printed descrip
tions of the murderer sent out. Word
was sent to Bellis to forward two pictures
of the suspect.
The pictures arrived to-day, but there is
considerable doubt as to whether the right
man has been captured. The face and
figure bear a strong resemblance to Dun
ham but not enough to warrant a belief
that it is him. A number of people who
were well acquainted with the murderer
are inclined to mink that the suspect is
Dunham, despite the changed appearance.
The picture was shown to Major Hin
man, who is an acknowledged authority
on criminology. He remarked at once that
the resemblance to Dunham was striking
and believed that it would be advisable to
send a man to Fargo to ascertain if the
fugitive murderer is in custody at that
place. In his opinion a man personally
acquainted with Dunham should be sent
on that errand.
The general opinion of those who have
seen the picture, however, is that the case
is one of mistaken identity, and that the
Fargo man is not the Campbells butcher.
Th>Â« officials have not decided what course
i they will pursue in the matter.
j Before his arrest Dalton stopped at the
j Elliott House in Farco, where his queer
actions attracted attention. After staying
several days he rented a wheel to go to
Moorhead, where he was subsequently
arrested and taken back to Fargo. â¢

TRACK-LAYERS AT LA GRANGE
Working Away From the San Joaquin
at the Rate of a Mile and
a Half a Day.
FRESNO, Cal., July 3â J. T. Williams
arrived in this city this evening with im
portant news regarding the progress of
work on the San Joaquin Valley Railway.
Grading from the north to the San Juan
River has been nearly completed, and a
camp of fifty teams crossed the river to
day. Track-laying will be completed to
the river by July 25, when the bridge will
have been finished.
The contract for grading from the river
to this city has been let to Grant Brothers
and J. D. McDougald, and they will place
150 teams at work next wees, in addition
to the fifty teams which were moved across
the river to-day.
Dirt will soon be flying, and the graders
will reach this city by August J. The
track-layers will follow closely, and the
rails will undoubtedly all be laid by Au
gust 15, tbe date for tbe completion of the
line, as promised Fresnoans by the direct
ors.
Williams reports everything going
smoothly to tbe city limits of Fresno.
The work is progressing fully as well as
could be expected. The bridge over the
San Joaquin has been going up without a
hitch. I rack-laying is proceeding at the
rate of a mile and a half a day, the force
beine now at La Grange, in Merced
County. It is not the intention to con
tinue grading along Diana and Q streets
through this city until the trouble with
the property-owners along those streets is
settled. The railroad company desires to
have all strife ended before proceeding
with the work. It is hoped that the dif
ferences will have been arranged by the
middle of August, so that work may not
be delayed.

SAM JOAQUIN VALLEY PEST.
Millions of Army Worms Toiling Patiently
Toward the Southern Grain
Fields.
STOCKTON, Cal., July 3.â Army worms
have invaded the San Joaquin Valley.
This is the startling news brought to
Stockton to-day by Rancher W. H. Cady,
who lives twenty miles east of here, and
his brother, A. Cady of L indon.
The Cady brothers were driving to the
city early this morning. On the way they
saw millions of small worms along the
roadside. They first noticed the invaders
about two and a half miles this side of
Linden, near Assessor Ortman's place, and
for a mile and a half the road appeared as
though it had been swept with a brush,
where the many wiggling worms had
worked themselves across it.
They were on the south side of the rode
as the Cadys drove along, having during
the night crawled from tbn pasture land
on the oorth side of the highway. This
morning they were going for the grain
fields of the south. The worms were so
numerous that they constituted squirm
ing masses at some points. They were
undoubtedly army worms, such as visited
this county several years ago, when they
destroyed apricots and all small fruic in
their path.
It is fortunate that the grain all over the
country is so near the sack; otherwise the
visitation of the army worms would have
resulted in the Joss "of thousands of dol
lars. As it is, they can do little damage
before the grain is harvested. The army
worm could do considerable damage to the
vineyards now. So far as known, bow
ever, they have not made their appearance
except in the locality stated.

STEAMSHIP LINE TO JAPAN.
Tacoma, Seattle or San Francisco Will
Be the Terminus of a New
System.
TACOMA, Wash.. July 3.â Tacoma,
Seattle or San Francisco will be the ter
minus of a line of steamers to tbe United
States, to be started in a few months by
the Nippon Yusen Kalsha.
8. Iwanga, manager of the steamship
line, Lawyer Mann Jina, its chief counsel,
and Mr. Kafuka, their private secretary,
arrived this afternoon and after viewing
harbor facilities here departed to-night for
Portland.
They are accompanied by Vice-Presi
dent Finley of the Great Northern Rail
way, which will work hard to have the
steamship line connect with that road at
Bellingham Bay or Seattle. From Port
land the gentlemen go 10 St. Paul to con
fer with President J. J. Hill, and later
they expect to visit San Francisco.
There is a possibility that the line will
go to California, though it seems probable
Puget Sound will be selected as the ter
minus. As nearly as can be learned the
Northern Pacific people have as yet had
no negotiations with the steamship com
pany.
Ine latter has stated that freight is what
it wants, and that the terminus will go to
the city that can furnish the most busi
ness. They expect to start the line with
one steamship per month before the year
endÃ, and to increase the number of boats
as fast as the business will warrant.
Power to Light Santa Cruz.
BANTA CRUZ, Cal., July 3. -The Big
Creek Power Company has contracted

strating its capacity for furnishing au ex
traordinary light by illuminating the Odd

MODERN NAVIES.
Interesting Furtt Gathered From a
Recent Publication.
The first full and exhaustive collection
of facts and figures relating to the modern
navies of all nations has been piepared by
W. Laird Clowes, the data being complete
to February of this year. 'The Naval
PocKet-Book" is a volume of nearly one
thousand pages, printed in fine, clear type
on onion-skin paper,, containing a com
plete description of every vessel owned
by any Government, whether battle-ship
or steam launch, revenue cutter or hulk,
and telling where it was February l!
Whenever needed, for vessels of new types,
plans are added, making the booK indis
pensable to all persons interested in tbe
question of naval armament. On page
700 the author presents a comparative
summary of the fleets of the worid, divid
ing i is vessels according to their strength
to resist and power to attack. Those "for
liueof battle' are divided into five classes:
IA-'I A - '

These are the real fignting vessels, in
cluding three classes of battle-ships (A, B
and (.'), sea-going coast-defense ironclads
(Dj and armored cruisers (F) that could
right against battle-ships. Only its ar
mored cruisers put the United States
ahead of Turkey, to which it is inferior in
battle-ships. The summary includes not
only all vessels built or building, but all
projected to February 1, since which time
the British Government has ordered an
addition of eleven to its present fleet of
seventy-five.
For the protection or destruction of com
merce, "scouting and looking out," which
will be the chief work of the cruisers, the
United States is not so badly off. There
are six classes, according to size and
weight of guns, of which G, H and J are
protected by some armor, X partially pro

This puts the United States as fourth,

NEW YORK TREE TO HIM.
The Doctor Who Served Sheridan Re
membered.
A prominent citizen of Philadelphia re
lates that a few days after the publication
of the letter of the eminent physician, Dr.
William Pepper, in which the latter
gracefully and generously declined to ac
cept any compensation for the valu
able professional services he had ren
dered to the heroic Sheridan in his last
illness, he was driving across New York
on his way home, via Jersey City, when
he was stopped at Broadway by one of the
great street pajreants of tbelate campaign.
Being anxious to eaten the next train, he j
appealed to a policeman to permit the |
procession to be broken for tbe passage of
his hackney coach.
The otticer was polite but firm in refusal, ;
stating that his orders were not to break
the line except at stated intervals for the '
passage of streetcars. It having been rep
resented that the gentleman's business
was very urgent, he answered that in
five minutes, vrhen tbe cars would be
permitted to pass, he would be given
leave to fail in behind them if he would
give the officer his name and address for
use in the event of his superior demand
ing an explanation. The name and ad
dress were no sooner furnished â the for
mer being almost identical with that of
tne celebrated physician and provost of
the university â then the line was halted
and broken, and the carriage immediately
allowed to pass.
The officer touched his bat to the sur
prised Philadelphian, who bad not then
heard of Dr. Pepper's letter, and said:
"The man who served Sheridan and re
fused to take a fee for his services can pass
anywhere, and at any time through New
York."
W AGER WAR IN
SEATTLE HOMES.
Mrs. Dawson Says General
Carr Is a Society
Meddler.
VERSED IN INTRIGUE.
She Declares That He Induced
Her Husband to Sue for
a Divorce.
STOEY TOLD BY THE WIFE.
Recital of a Plot to Compel Her to
Quietly Submit to a Legal
Separation.
SEATTLE, Wash., July 3.â The most
interesting witness in the Dawson divorce
case to-day was the fair defendant. She
commenced her story at last night's ses
j sion in Judge Hume's court, resumed it
j this morning and finished late this after
noon. Mrs. Dawson created a sensation
by vehemently declaring that General
Carr, at the head of tbe State Guards, was
at the bottom of the trouble between her
self and husband. She charged that the
militia leader invaded her home to bring
discord, and that it was because of his
counsels that her husband instituted the
present action.
Mrs. Dawson testified that not since
their married life had Dr. Dawson been so
kind to her as since filing the present suit.
It was formerly his custom to come home
but once a day, and that usually late at
night. Since he commenced this suit,
however, he had never failed to call on
her at least once, and sometimes two or
three times daily. She said he brought
her icecream and other dainties and at
night came into her boudoir and con
versed with her. He admitted, she said,
that he never intended that the papers in
this case should become a matter of
record, but simply had been prepared in
tbe hope of forcing her not to contest tne
divorce.

VENTURA, Cal., July 3.â The third
day of tbe Grand Army encampment has
been passed in completing preparations
for to-rcorrow's parade, which will be the
greatest in the history of the association.
Arrivals continue to swell the ranks; tent
room is being engaged by wire, and each

MAYOR SUTR O IN TOWN
Increased Allowance Requested
by the Board of
Health.
Colin M. Boyd Asks for Proper Main
tenance of the Free
Library.
Mayor Sutro returned to the City from
his Calistoga ranch yesterday morning.
For a brief season the contractors and
others who were awaiting his Honor's ap
proval of certain demands and resolutions
were happy. This joy was transient, for
when tbe Mayor was ready to sign the
documents it was ascertained that his sec
retary had sent them by mail to Napa
County. The Mayor had not been ex
pected, so it was decided to send the papers
to him. This, of course, deepened the
gloom. It is possible that the Mayor may
go up to Calistoga, sign the resolutions
and lettirn them before Monday. Another
plan is for the Mayor to stay in town aud
await the papers by return mail.
Colonel Taylor, chairman of the Finance
Committee, regarded it as a remarkable
transaction that the official orders await
ing Â»he Mayor's approval should go out of
the City Hal!. It was still more remark
able that they should be sent to Napa
County.
The Finance Committee of the Board of
Supervisorsâ Messrs. Taylor, Benjamin
and Hobb's â met yesterday afternoon. Es
timates for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1897, were not taken up in regular oriierj
but the committee heard Conn M. Bavd
on behalf of the Free Public Library, J. B
Heinstein for the Board of Health and J
A. Filcher for the State Board of Trade.
Mr. Boyti, as one of the trustees of the
library, desired the allowance for that in
stitution to be fixed at $58,000. The sum
of $50,000 which tire committee had pro
posed was inadequate, as a new branch of
the library bad been established at Third
and Harrison streets and trie new elevator
in the main library must be provided for.
Mr. Boyd mentioned the increasing use
fulness and popularity of the library and
made an eloquent appeal for its proper
maintenance.
The chairman promised to give the sub
ject full anil lair consideration.
J. B. Keinstein, who was re-enforced by
Dr. Loveiace, Health Officer, presented a
document to the committee, which he said
was signed by taxpayers who paid taxes
on five hundred million dollars' worth of
property. When he was informed that
the valuatiou of all the taxable property
in the City did not exceed $350,000,000, he
was prepared to modify the original state
ment. The document which Mr. Rein
stein desired the committee to consider
reads:
Revolved, That it is the sense of the committee
appointed at the meetiup held in the Chamber
0 C on ?raerce, May 24, 1896, to discuss the
public health of the City and County of San
Francisco, thfct the Board of Supervisors of said
City should appropriate at least $34,800 over
and above the amounts aud sums appropriated
in tne year 1895. for the Health Department
for sneb additional Inspectors and expense* as
to the Hoard of Healtn shall seem expedient
and necessary for the better preservation of
the public health in this City.

J. A. Filcher from the State Board of
Trade addressed the committee, askinc an
appropriation under the Jaw authorizing
counties to appropriate money to promote
immigration. He read from the county
government act the authorization for
counties of the first-class to allow $2500 a
year for immigration purposes. Mr.
Filcher seid as an additional reason why
San Francisco should join other counties
in the work of bringing new settlers 10
the State was the fact that the Board of
Trade was located in this City. He said:
"We propose to get a small amount from
every county in the State. We should
like to make an exhibit at Boston and
Omaha similar to the display we made at
Atlanta. We won seventy-nve medals for
our Sia'.e exhibit at Atlanta."
Mr. Filcher said that twenty-seven
counties now contriDuting to the
fund. He did not ask for the full amount
which the law authorized the board to
appropriate, but did suegest that $50 a
month should be voted by San Francisco
to help sustain the Board ot Trade.
The application will receive further con
sideration before the estimates are adopted.
A SWISS MOUNTAIN STORM.
A Tourist Passed Through It on His
Way to Lucerne Cathedral.
From Interlachen we went over the
Brunig Pass together to Lucerne. WniJe
crossing Lake Lucerne we were favored
with a mountain storm. It carve up sud
denly. The sun was shining brightly when
the storm burst upon us, the thun
der crashing terrifically, the rain pour
ing down in torrents, the wind blowirg
furiously, the setting sun tinging the
clouds with red, the rain looKing like
blood. I never saw anything more terri
bly beautiful. The storm passed over in a
few minutes, the wind bundling ud one
great cloud and rolling it along the face
of the Righi like a bmge ball.
Icanspeak of only one thing in Lucerne â
the great organ in the cathedral. The sun
was shining brightly wnen we went in.
After waiting a iew minutes the organist
began. I do not know the name of the
selection. I was not at first particularly
impressed. I only just enjoyed the
music. Very soon, however, the music
changed. It was evidently representing
a storm. We could hear the first sighing
of the wind, then it would die away, and
there was a pattering of raindrops; then
the wind rising and low murmurs of
thunder. All at once a crash of thunder,
the wind seemed to be driving everything
before it, the rain poured down in torrents.
1 looked out of the door to see whether or
not a sudii<-n storm had come up. The
sun was shining brightly. Suddenly it
seemed to me that a voice stiid, "Peace, be
â till." The storm died away ; it seemed as
though I couid see the clouds breaking
a^ay, the sun coming out. A beautiful
hymn of praise was swee ly cuanted. I
looked to see where the choir was. There
was no choir; it was all the organ. It
tilled us all with a feeling of awe, and
when the organ stopped we stole out
quietly; aud even after we were in the open
air we felt as though we hardly ouj;nt to
speak aloud.â Treasure Trove.

"Larry" Godkin on Gentlemen.
To say with emphasis tliat a man is a
gentleman in our language is proverbially,
so far as tliis workl toes, tbe hiiiijost en
comium that he can receive. No epitnet
add anything to it; on the contrary, it is
reduced by epithets, because it implies in
our usage all the highest qualities that a
man can have among men. A trutlilul
gentleman, a brave gentleman, a reliable
gentleman are pleonastic and even vulgar
expression â pleonastic because tbe word
gentleman implies all these other quali
ties, ruigar because no one who is a gentle
man wonld be capable of failing to recog
nize this fact.
As the Roman vir had by the term it
self the qualities which virtus implied, so
our gentleman has all the qualities which
in medieval theory or fancy went with
"tentle" blood. This can be seen by the
qualities left out, as well as by those in
cluded. Virtues peculiar to women are
not "connoted" ; it has been justly sairi
that a woman cannot by any possibility
have the feelings of a gentleman.â New

IS GAINING THE DAY
California a Dumping Ground for
the English Manu
facturers*
CONVINCING ARGUMENTS BY FAIR
THINKERS.
Our Wholesale Houses Little Better Than Peddlin
Auction Establishments Without a Sound
Protective Policy.
The political ballâ protection for Cali- |
fornia industries as against the money is
sue â which The Call started a-rolling,
is gaining new impetus daily. Each I
day brings fresh and convincing evi
dence of the strong sentiment in
favor of a protective tariff as the issue
in this State rather than silver and
gold. Democrats who voted for the
low-tariff administration are outspoken in
their views and are as ready in the multi
plying of illustrations bearing on the
comparative effects of the McKinley and
Wilson bills as are the members of the
protection party.
"If we can make the laboring classes
understand that the manufacturing in
dustries must be protected to insure them
steady employment at good wages," say
the representative manufacturers, "we
can re-establish the protective policy. That
is where the hard work has got to be
done."
"Educate the idea that free silver means
pockets lined with money out of tbe heads
of the working classes," say the whole
salers and importers, "and they will give
us protection and live better themselves â
the more profitable is business generally
the easier lot will De that of the laborer."
And so it goes. Example after example
is furnished by tbe several branches of
trade and industrial departments showing
California's extreme need for protection.
The most indifferent political reasoner is
compelled to admit that the industries of
the State have suffered under the tariff
policy of the Democratic administration.
As one political thinker expressed it Cali
fornia is made to suffer that the East may
prosper, in many instances oy the
Eutopean manufacturers using the State
for a dumping-ground when the Eastern
markets have an extra surplus. Tariff is
the only remedy.
A. I). Spearman.
"If the present condition of business on
the Pacific Coast is not enough to convince
the voter of average intelligence that tariff
is the prime issue in California," said Mr.
Spearman when hia attention was called
to the rosition taken by The Call, "then
there is little hope for relief from the bal
lot-box."
Mr. Spearman is at the head of one of
the leading woolen-mill agencies on the
Pacific Coast.
"California is in greater need of protec
tion, perhaps, than any other part of the
United States. Our manufacturing in
dustries are at tbe mercy of the Eastern as
well as the European manufacturer. This
may seem strange until one takes into con
sideration that California is a dumping
ground. It may not be generally under
stood, but it is the indisputable fact just
the same, that the manufacturers of Europe
protect the import rs of the East and the
principal wholesalers in the big trade
centers the other side of the Rocky Moun
tains at the expense of the West.
"When there is a threatening surplus on
hand it is dumped in here. Our so-called
wholesale houses, under these circum
stances, become nothing but peddling
auction-houses. The money question is of
great importance to us in one way â we
want distributing centers. But not as a
political is^ue is it of importance to this
coast. We want manufacturing plants
that will put several thousand dollars in
circulation monthly. That cannot be
done, though, unless we can establish and
operate such plants under favorable tariff
auspices. Protection for California is
vital. How any man of sound judgment
and good reasoning rowers can fail to see
it is beyond my comprehension. I be
lieve protection will be really the issue in
the East.
"Mr. Knight of the Marysvije Woolen
mills, who was a delegate to tbe St. Louis
convention, dropped in to see me the other
dny, and during the course of our friendly
confab on politics he gave it as his belief
that protection would be the real issue in
the East and not silver. 'There has been
a great hue and cry raised about silver,"
he said, 'but we will find that the mam
issue is the tariff after all,' and I am pre
pared to Deiieve that he is about right. At
all events our people cannot close their
eyes to the grave need of the local indus
tries for protection."
Joieph Wagner.
The Joseph Wagner Manufacturing
Company of 101-3 Mission Btreet is one of
tbe largest machinery manufactories in
San Francisco. In fact it is practically
the only firm that manufactures flour
mills.
"I am a firm believer in protection,"
said Mr. Wagner, "and believe that is the
only principle on which the Republican
party should stand firm. There is no
doubt that the salvation of our industries
depends largely upon the relief we get
from tbe protective tariff.
"Protection is the California gospel, and
it should be vigorously advocated by its
apostles. The sooner we obtain relief the
better. If anything I can do or say will
tend toward the Republican party's
triumph in the coming earn paign you may
rest assured that The Call has my hearty
and sincere co-operation.
â 'The general depression resultant from
tbe inaction of the Wilson bill has been
felt in our business as well as the rest.
Prior to that time we manufactured flour
mills exclusively, but have since found it
expedient to branch out and include many
other kinds of machinery.
"Though I am not what would be called
entirely conversant with the provisions of
the McKinley bill, my knowledge is suffi
cient to warrant me in saying that I do
not believe many articles were placed
under as high a duty as they should have
been. In a high tariff lies our only hope.
With it will come a revival of business
and consequent prosperity."
Italian-Swiss Colony.
Among the largest vineyards and wine
cellers in the State is that of the Italian-
Swiss Colony, near CJoverdale, Sonoma
County. The company ships wine to the
large cities of the United Slates and Eu
rope, and has agencies in some of the
principal distributing centers of Europe.
While there are several members of the
company who do not|ezubrace llepublican
ism as their politics, the following ex
pression in favor of protection was given
out by the company yesterday: "The
wine industry is certainly one of those
which need protection in California. The
tariff is the leading issue by all means, not
only on this coast but in the United
States. The finance question need trouble
our voters but little. If we can compete
profitably with the manufacturers and
producers of Europe, and even the Eastern
States, the money wilt come to us all
right. Yes, we do sell wine in European
countries under the present tariff, and we
also come in direct competition with the
imported wines in the Eastern States.
But that is due to merit.
"If we did not make a good quality of
wines we could not nope to do much
against oar foreign competitors. Under
the low tariff the winemakers of Europe
get in a lot of wines of various qualities
and we have got to meet their prices or go
out of the business. It is that condition
of affairs which keeps the smaller growers
and manufacturers down. They are not
in a position to hold their wines and the
commission merchants, being compelled
to meet the wines from across the water
in the Eastern markets, cannot afford to
pay the grower a profitable price for his
cellar. It might make some difference if
the growers could hold their wines and
force a market, but not much. The great
need is a tariff. It is by lone odds the
great issue in this State and The Call's
educational campaign should be encour
aged and heartily supported irrespective
of party. The successful party must make
that the issue."
E. Gamier & Co.
This firm deals extensively in native
wines, and also dots some importing.
"The wine industry is a part of California
life," said Mr. Gamier, "and its develop
ment and prosperity depend on our
ability to place our wines on sale in the
Eastern markets in competition with the
imported goods from France, Germany
and Italy. The growers are the ones
chiefly interested in a protective tariff.
The middlemen who handle the product
of the vineyards and wine-presses are not
so vitally affected. Of course there would
be more money in their business if the
industry was prosperous along all lines,
but the grower and wine-maker have no
way in which to save themselves.
""If the merchants can't handle the wine
at a profit they cannot afford to pay the
grower and maker what the product is
| worth. We are all at the mercy of the
foreign competitor, so long as the tariff
laws are such that he can lay his goods in
the Eastern market at a price less than we
can afford to grow the grapes for. There
i are not a few vineyards in the State that
have been dug up within the last two
years. Our land and labor are too valu
able for a man to do anything but lose
money in raising grapes at $6 or $7 a. ton.
If the farmers do not appreciate the bear
ing which the logic of such cold facts has
on the tariff question and its importance
as an issue to California, nothing else can
possibly convince them. Protection means
the very life of our industries and the
prosperity of our people."
Leege & Mills.
This is the leading chickory manufac
tory on the coast and tbe firm is exten
sively engaged in' the importation of teas,
coffees, etc. Thomas Haskins, the junior
member of the firm, said yesterday: "It
is most obvious that California's vital in
terests are centered in her industries.
That means protection. The tariff is the
issue in this State ahead of all others, end
the voters will see it before the campaign
is half over. As a forcible illustration,
take the article of chickory. With a pro
tective tariff it might become one of the
leading products of the country. Hun
dreds of thousands of dollars would be in
vested in the growing and preparation of
the weed and the money that is sent out
of the country, annually would be kept at
home. There was some. chickory grown
in New. Jersey, but the importation of the
dried weed ready for grinding, at a low
price, made it impossible for the growers
to continue the production.
"The climate and soil of California are
adapted to ' the luxurious growth of the
weed, and if there was tariff protection it
would be one of the most profitable de
partments of agriculture in the State.
While I am willing to concede that the
tariff is the prime, issue in California, and
has a vital connection. with our industrial
prosperity, I still believe we are interested
in the finance question. To make my
meaning clear, I need but refer to the sil
ver mines; on our east. When they were
in full operation the cities and towns were
well populated. Buildings were in con
stant course of construction, and the
lively business of the times gave us a mar
ket for all our natural products and manu
factures. Those markets are closed to us
now because the mines are closed. This is
a strong reason why we should be inter
ested in silver on account of the States en
gaged in its production, though the tariff
and protection of , our local industries
come 1 lirst and are naturally the prime
issue." ' â '. '-' 'â ..' "
A Valuable Opinion.
Here Is an indorsement of The Call's
position . that slfould carry much weight
on account of the manner in which it was
expressed. ...
The local manager of one of the largest
manufacturing establishments in tne
United States, with agencies all over the
world, who is . well and popularly known
in. business, club and social circles, said
yesterday:
."I am a protectionist. It is the only
issue in California,. but when I explain
my position : you will, ' I feel t sure, ap
preciate my reasons for wishing to keep
my name out of print. Our firm deals
with many of the largest establishments
in the United >. States and Europe. Our
business amounts up into the millions an
nually. - ,
"Our customers are widespread and have
diversified political interests, and it is not
wise for the company to offend the opin
ions of ; its patrons by figuring promi
nently in politics. The incautious utter
ances of ? one of 'our ! managers in a large
Eastern city caused the firm to lose one of
its wealthiest customers. That is my only
excuse for giving my opinion in this way.

this fall condertins the country to another
period of depression. Every trade, com
mercial interest and industry demands
protection."
California Italian Taste Company.
Editor Call: In rerjly to your query as to
which of tbe two, the tariff or the money
question, is considered by the manufacturers
of Italian pastes in this country to be of more
importance, we will slate that the money
question has never been considered a factor in
ihe increase or decrease^ of our business.
What effect a change of standard may have
in the future we are not prepared to discuss.
We do know, however, that since the Wilson
tariff became a law the number of factories
in our line in the United States has decreased,
the number of men employed in the remain
ing: factories has decreased and the output
hÂ«s decreased at least one-third, while the
amount of imports has increased more than
30 per cent.
This article of food is one of the cheapest of
farlntceous foods, so palatable ana oi such
health-producinp properties that it is no longer
considered a luxury, but a stwple, and can be
found on the table of the poor as well us the
rich. We cannot therefore attribute the de
pression in our business to hard times. There
{â¢â¢ only one enemy we can point the linger to
and that is the tariff. Previous to the Wilson
law we enjoy, d n protective duty of 2 cents
P'>r pound. 'This was suflicieut to offset the
difference in the cost of labor between this
country and Europe. The Wilson bill took off
this specific duty and substituted an ad
valorem of 20 per cent. Whether this ad va
lorem duty means \\ cent or J^ cent per pound
depends entirely on the elacticity of conscience
of the European merchant who makes oath
before the American Consul as to the original
cost of his merchandise. The importance and
extent of this industry throughout the United
States is probably little known. There are
about 300 manufactories of Italian paste in
this country, giving employment to about
4000 men, mostly heads of families, who re
ceive on an average $!Â£ 25 per day.
The raw material is manufactured out of
whe&t raised in this country, it is wrapped in
paper made in this country and packed in
boxes of home manufacture." You can there
fore see how any legislation affecting us affects
as well tne farmer, the paper manufacturer,
the box-maker -and the lumber-dealer. That
we need protection badly can be easily under
stood when we assert that the labor for which
we pay $2 25 per day in this country can be
easily obtained in Europe for 40 cents. As al
ready stated about 4000 families or 20,000 peo
ple are dependent on this industry in the
United States, to say nothing of the capital
invested. Whether this should be a matter of
concern to our '.ariff-makers the future will
tell. Yours respectfully.

IS A SINGER BY NATURE,
The Back Patti Tells How Her
Voice Was First Dis
covered.
She Has Appeared With Success Both
in America and in
Europe.
"I can never remember the time when I
did not sing," said Sissieretta Jones, the
"Biack Patti," when questioned yesterday
in her looms at the Russ House about her
first steps in the art of song.
"I used to sing to myself as a cbild be
cause I loved music, but it was after sing
ing a little solo at a Sunday-school con
cert at Providence that some peorile said
to my mother, 'The child took a high C;
you should let her learn music' That
was how I came to study."
Mrs. Jones is a very unassuming
young woman, who modestly disclaims
being a Patti, even a black Patti. It is a
name that a New York paper in an out
burst of enthusiasm gave her, and her
agents have gone on using it be
cause it is novel and attractive. To toll
the truth, the young singer is not black;
she is just the dark copper tinge that a
prima donna should be to p!ay "Aida" or
"L' Africaine," and one can ima me her
playing either role with majesty and
pathos.
She is tall and well-built, with a good
carriage, and last night the ease of her
movements was accentuated by a loose
flowing black silk robe, which by contrast
showed how brown her skin was. Round
her neck was some tawny-colored lace,
fastened with a diamond star, one of the
many Aits received from people who have
been charmed by her singing.
Up to the present the "Black Patti" has
MSMERETTA JONES, THE COLORED PRIMA DONNA.
only sung in concert, although a laree
part of her repertory consists of operatic
anas. When asked whether she had not
aspirations to appear in opera, she con
fessed that the lyric stage was one of her
dreams, but added that there were many
difficulties in the way: "I am traveling
most of the time, and it would be difficult
to study the roles; so much study is
necessary to do them well." And then
she hesitated and added, half timidly
that she feared there was another draw
backâshe was not of the color of most
prima donnas, and some people might be
prejudiced against her on that account.
When it was suggested that make-up
and wigs can effect marvelous transforma
tions on the stage, the "Black Patti"
shrank back with a deprecating gesture.
'Try to hide my lace and deny my own
people? Oh. I would never do that," she
exclaimed; and with a ring almost of ex
ultation in her softly modulated voice she
added: "I am proud of belonging to them
aud would not hide what I am even for an
evening."
In reply to the reminder that while
prima donnas who play Suleikaand Aida
assume an African nationality which they
do not possess, Sissieretta Jones replied:
"Yes, but that is different. With me, if I
made Â»myself white, prejudiced people
would say I was ashamed of being
colored."
It is only about five months since the
Black Patti returned from an almost
triumphal tour of Europe. She was feted
everywhere, especially in Paris. In criti
cal Naples Â»ne sang with great success,
and in Rome, a city she only passed
through, crowds went to the depot to see
the colored singer and beg her to let
them hear her voice. She was a nine
days' wonder there, for colored people are
a great rarity, and colored singers are
quite unknown.
At Monte Carlo the Black Patti ap
peared at rive successful concerts in the
Casino, and in London the Prince of
Wales and his brother, the DuKe of Cam
bridge, Doth went to hear her sing.
"I enjoyed being in Europe, but im
portant business compelled us lo come
home," said Mrs. Sissieretta Jones. And
her husband added laughingly, ''And the
important business was that she insisted
on coming bacK to America to see her
mother."

Seen from without there is a certain pic
j turcsqueness about a Svanetian village,

inconceivably filthy. They are filled with
rags, vermin and dirt of every description.

In these hou-es men and women and
children are huddled together; durine the
long winter months they are shut in days
at a time, the cattle often sharing their
quarters. Every aperture has to be closed
on account of the cold. This long impris
onment is, perhaps, tbe cause of the
degradation of the people. Horrible dis
eases result from it, which are aggravated
by an abnormal consumption of arrack.
the strong distilled drink of the Asiatics.
Besides being the dirtiest, they are prob
ably the laziest people on earth. It is an
invariable rule to make four days a week
holidays, with saints' days us extras.
Since they have adopted the holidays of
every other country with which have come
in contact, it is not surprising that tbe
men find little time for work.
Farming, bee-cuiture and cattle-breed
ing are the only industries of these lazy
people; throughout their territory there
is not a single manufactured article. Their
children marry while very young, they at
tend no school and lastly they have no
money.â Hartford Times.*

CHILD AND BRIDE
OF JULY FOURTH,
Miss Drinkall to Become
an Actress on Her
Birthday.
PATRIOTIC AND LUCKY.
Born on Independence Day She
Favors It for All Great
Events.
WISHES TO DIE ON THAT DAY.
But She Hopes That All Fireworks
Will Cease on the Day of
Her Funeral.
Miss Lou E. Drinkall, who was born
on tbe Fourth of July, initiated into tbe
dramatic art on the 4th, and who is to
make her theatrical debut on the 4th, says
| she wishes to die on an Independence
day.
Aside from that, however, she aspires to
tbe highest refined comedy fame.
Miss Drinkall has already obtained
recognition by her paintings, which were
exhibited at the World's Fair, and has
dipped into literature to such an extent
that her writingsâ short stories and
poemsâ have been accepted by the leading
magazines of this country.
On the 3d day of last July she came
to Fred Belasco and stated her intention
of becoming an actress. She desired to
be^inatonce. He told her it would be
impossible to give her an initial lesson
until the sth day of that month.
But tne will that sometimes accom
panies talent was too strong for Mr.
Belasco's scruples. The consequence was
that on the Fourth of July Miss Drinkall
took her first lesson in her chosen profes
sion.
So for a year she has been studying dili
gently. There are black-and-blue spots, so
her sister says, on various parts of ber
body as a result of the zeal she has exhib
ited in her stage falls.
Twelve months of severe training has
Drought her to that trying period in the
lives of all actresses â the debut. Again
the will before mentioned has carried the
day, and Miss Drinkall will make he first
appearance, "just for luck's sake," as she
says, before her numerous friends on her
favorite dayâ the Fourth of July.
The stage will be draped with red. white
and blue buntings, and Old Glory will be
conspicuously displayed.
Yesterday as she discussed her debut
she sat amid a congregation of fireworks â
her birthday presents. In tact, her friends
dare not proffer her any other birthday gift
than a bunch of firecrackers or a bundle of
skyrockets.
One friend gave her a bunch of "can
non" and swears he will set fire to the en
tire pack on the rising of the first curtain.
It was even whispered among her near
acquaintances that she has purchased
bunting herself to decorate the stage on
the event of her managers not meeting
her patriotic demand.
Miss Drinkall is a Native Daughter and
comes of a family prominent in Califor
nia. Her father is one of the well-known
politicians of this State. It was her fam
;iy that directed her genius in the chan
nel of art, but nature will out, and on the
Fourth of July of her majority she
dropped pallet and maulstick for the
staL-e.
"It has always been my ambition," said
she, yesterday* "to be an actress. When a
little girl I would arrange an impromptu
stage in the nursery ana perform for the
edification of my audience of dolls."
"Are you married?" the interviewer
timidly asked.
"Yes, married to Fourth of July and the
stage, " answered she, without hesitation.
"I was born on that day, and some timeâ a
long, long number of years henceâ l hope
to die on that day."
It has been generally acknowledged that
the face and figure of Miss Drinkall closely
resemble those of the famous Ada Rehan.
Ada Rehan has complete mastery of
facial expression. In this Miss Drinkall
comes into keen competition. Her won-
I derful knowledgeqf this arthas astonished
j her professional friends.
Christening a Ship.
Some English shipbuilders propose to
abandon the wine-christening ceremonies
a i- future launching of vessels, but will
substitute for it another idea Hereafter,
instead of breaking tbe bottle of cham
pagne on the vessel's nose the lady will
let loose a cageful of swift birds, which
will fly in all directions as the ship begins
to move, typifying the diverse nature of
commerce. The idea, which is borrowed
from the Japanese, teaches liberty and
economy.
On Crusoe's Island.
On Robinson Crusoe's Island, Juan Fer
nandez, there are only nine species of
land birds, two of them humminc birds
and four birds of prey. The humming
birds do not love the sunshine, but stay
in tbe shade. There are two kinds of sea
gulls about the island, the Fardela del dia,
a diver, and the Fardela de la noche,
which flies about ia tiocka at sunset.

There is no land like ours and this is tbe
time to remember it.
Celebrate to-day, rest to-morrow and
then give Monterey a call.
There may be queens of beauty else
where, but none are like ours.
There will be lots of noise in town to
day, but it will be a good noise.
Silver and gold will be merged to-day in
the glory of the red, white and blue.
Spread the eagle as much as you can.
There is no danger of busting the bird.
Critics may call it jingoism, but the peo
ple know that wnat they feel is American
ism.
If the fireman had his way he would fire
all the crackers into the wet ocean at one
swoop.
Get out with the crowd, mingle with the
people, catcb the enthusiasm of the oc
casion.
Tbe heat at Chicago to-day will come
dangerously near the point of spontaneous^
combustion.
Don't miss the parade, don't miss the
jeechesâ take in tbe whole celebration
and rejoice in it.
We can remember to-day that even
Cleveland has a redeeming qualityâ he Ls
an American citizen.
"Yankee Doodle" is a good tune to
march to and every American knows bow
to keep the quickstep.
There may be in the woria some better
things than firecrackers, but none of them
go off with so much snap.
The play at Chicago is "Much Ado
About Nothing," but you will find the San
Francisco drama "As You Like It."
To make sure of good reading to-mor
row and full reports of the celebration,
leave orders to-day for The Bcsday Call.
Americans in all parts of the world will
unite to celebrate the day and Old Glory
will be honored and toasted ail round the
globe.
The parades and the pageants of the
celebration will be good practice for what
we are going to do when the carnival
comes.
The Democrats are welcome to whatever
Bland feeling tney may cherish at present.
It won't last long after the campaign gets
started.
We shall soon be divided into three
political camps, but to-day we are all one
people, with one country, one flag and one
aspiration.
There will not be much gambling on the
result of this election, as almost every
body has too mucti virtue to bet against
McKinley. _______
See to it that neither jour bouse, your
barn nor your woodshed gets mixed up
with the celebration and tries to make a
bonfire of itself.
The demand in this country for oratory
was always great, but it never yet equaled
the supply. Even to-day there will be
more in reserve than there is on tap.
American patriotism regards the Fourth
of July as something more than a holiday
for a* frolic, and every citizen should take
some thought of its meaning and its in
spiration, as well as of its pageants and its
firework?.
In the enthusiasm of to-day men of all
parties will unite with Republicans in re
sponding to Senator Tburston's pled re of
"a deathless loyalty to all that is truly
American and a patriotism as eternal as
tbe stars."
The Bulletin appeared ytsterday with a
new style make-up for its editorial page,
which in an attractive way distinguished
that from other pages of thÂ« paper. This
is only one of the many instances in which
our contemporary has shown a progres
sive spirit and a willingness to change old
ways for better ones, so that it now rightly
takes rank among tbe more enterprising
Journals of the country.
INDEPENDENCE DAY.
One hundred and twenty years ago tÂ©
day thirteen of the American colonies an
nounced their separation from tne king
dom of Great Britain by a formal declara
tion of independence. Then, as rapidly
as possible, the machinery necessary to
put the new Government in operation was
constructed on lines of personal liberty
and the sovereignty of the individual.
To-day we celebrate the anniversary of
that bold and daring deed, and it is not
only right that we should, but the people
of all nations could consistently join
with us.
Juiy 4, 1776, marked the beginning of a
new cycle in the political and social evolu
tion of the race, nor have the people of
any nation escaped the beneficent influ
ence of the music of liberty's bell, whose
echo still inspires men everywhere to
strive for truer and loftier planes of exist
ence. The American Declaration of Inde
pendence is now recognized the world
over as the ethical basis of true patriotism,
and as fast as the people of other lands
come to comprehend and appreciate the
deep and broad meaning of "a Govern
ment of tte people, by the people and for
the people" they grow restless for a wider
range of personal freedom, which is in
turn reflected as a mighty influence upon
the powers that be, and thus does the
spirit,, which inspired the American Dec
laration of Independence move upon the
hearts of all people.
But some of us misapprehend the inner
meaning of the Declaration of Independ
ence. It stands for the sovereignty of the
citizen and for personal liberty, but it no
where stands for license unconstrained. It
stands for liberty under law, but not lib
erty without law, for that would be an
archy. Our Declaration of Independence
is a principle or a theory, while our gov
ernment is a policy practically applied in
harmony with that principle or theory.
In conferring sovereignty upon the indi
vidual our system of government also en
courages education and individual wealth
accumulation, but, on the other hand, it
requires more of the intelligent and the
property-owner. It places greater ooliga
tiona upon such, because the same quality
of mind which enables one to acquire
knowledge from the deeper things of wis
dom and to gather material things in
quantities is required to formulate social
and political standards from time to time
that the onward and upward march of the
people as a whole may not be hindered by
their clinging to those things which served
their purpose yesterday, but which would
be inadequate to tbe requirements of to
day. "For unto whomsoever much is
given, of him shall be much required."
As an annual jubilee, the Fourth of
July should be bailed with rejoicing and
festivity by old and young alike, for it
comes as a benediction from the Over Soul
of humanity. There cannot be too many
loud huzzas, nor can expression of grati
tude to the Giver of every good and perfect
gift be too demonstrative. There is an in
timate relation and a close bond of union
between the effort of all in attempt to do
honor to the mightiness of the spirit of
the day we celebrate. The voice of liberty
sounds as musical to the ear of Freedom
in the outburst of the firecracker as in the
well-rounded and polished sentence of the
orator. Therefore let the firecracter be
unrestrained, and let "joy be unconfined"
everywhere. On this day Liberty stands
for confusion, for excitement, for bun
combe, for bombast, for self-glorification,
for unreasonable boasting and for the
boiling-over of patriotism, but in the
silence that reigns beneath it all the heart
singeth:
I do love
Mr country's pood, with a respect more tender,
More holy, and profound, than mine own life.
WHITNEY'S OPINION.
Mr. Whitney thinks he sees something
iv the troubles of the Democracy this year
which remind him of the predicament it
got itself into In ISGO. Whether he sees it
or not it is ttert, and, moreover, if he will
examine tbe cause and tbe effect of his
party's stupidity in 18G0 he will be able to
see that the people are getting ready to
again bury it for a long term of years.
For twenty-four year 9 tbe people kept the
Democratic party in limbo. Then they
permitted it to elect one of its members
President, and eight years later the entire
affairs of the Government were given into
Us bands. Mr. Whitney knows very well
what the consequences were of that foolish
act of tbe people, and if he would lay aside
his partisan judgment and analyze the
situation with bis practical, common busi
ness sense, no doubt be would quicKly
agree with tbe people that tbe business
interests of the country demand the re
burial of bis party for good and all.
It is true, notwithstanding the incom
petency of the Cleveland administration,
that the Democracy counts some of the
best men in the country among its dis
ciples, and were they in charge of the
party's affairs a very different showing
would be made. Mr. Whitney himself re
gards the present tariff law as an inex
cusable party blunder. In fact, he op
posed it on the ground that it left interests
at the mercy ot low-wage competition
which should have protection, and upon
other issues he has not been in harmony
with bis party for some years. But there
are thousands of other Democrats who
are not in sympathy with the Altgeld-
Bland-Tillman kind of Democracy, and
after they have battled to the last in the
Chicago convention for the Democracy of
Jefferson and Jackson they will cast their
political associations with Republicans.
There would be nothing strange in that,
for the Republican party was founded by
Whigs and Democrats, and there have been
many notable accessions from the ranks
of tbe Democracy. Grant, Stanton, Sheri
dan and Logan were Democrats until they
saw that the policy of the Republican
party was better suited to unfold and de
velop the wealth sources of the country.
Mr. Whitney will be quite welcome when
he concludes to come where he properly
belongs.
M'LEAN'S FEARS.
John R. McLean, the Ohio Democ
racy's favorite son and whom it will
boom for the nomination at Chicago, ex
presses fears that the goldbug!) will buy
up enough silver delegates to give them
control of the conveution. If Mr. Mc-
Lean's fears are well founded a most in
teresting state of affairs will be presented.
Will the payments be made in "sound"
dollars or in "50-cent" dollars? Accord
ing to the views hitherto expressed by the
silverites who will sell their votes silver
should have the largest possible field of
circulation and gold should not be re*
garded with so much distinction as Wall
street has given to it. On the other hand,
the goldbugs would not atoop to transact
business with silver. A middleman, it
would appear, would be needed to con
vert the goldbugs' yellow metal into white
metal before tbe transaction could be con
summated. This gold-silver complication
comes at a bad time for the good of peace
and harmony.
But is not Mr. McLean a little rash in
announcing âor the equivalent of an
nouncingâthat the silver delegates are for
sale? That kind of announcement in his t
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JULY 4, 1896.
newspaper as a full-paid advertisement
would be all right, but it could hardly be
called good politics for a candidate to
notify his competitor that his delegates
were for sale. However, it is an affair be
tween Democrats, and Mr. McLean should
know better than we how many delegates
are on the market as commercial commodi
ties, but John R. McLean is himself a
very rich man in both gold and silver.
OBJECT LESSONS IN POLITICS.
Charles A. Dana, who was Assistant
Secretary of War during the Rebellion,
has been delivering; throughout tbe East a
lecture on Lincoln, which is at the same
time extremely interesting for its reminis
cences and accurate as to its facts. Among
the incidents of Lincoln's administration
upon which Mr. Dana dwells with the
most of detail are those which attended
the passage through Congress and the
adoption by the States of the constitu
tional amendment abolishing slavery.
The abilities of Abraham Lincoln as a
practical politician find ample illustration
in these incidents. As Mr. Dana relates
them, it appears that the conviction had
grown in the President's mind that the
passage of the amendment would be
worth in moral effect to the Nation an
army of a million men. It was found,
however, tha; two difficulties confronted
those who hoped and labored for the suc
cess of the measure.
The first of these was the lack of one
favorable State to make the requisite
three-fourths for its adoption. To obviate
this difficulty Mr. Lincoln suggested and
procured the admission of Nevada into the
Union in order that her vote might insure
the result. To the critics of a later day
who are inclined to sneer at Nevada as a
petty and superfluous State, Mr. Dana
cites the saying of Lincoln that "It is
easier to admit Nevada than to raise an
other million of soldiers."
The second obstacle which lay in the
way of the amendment was the perilous
closeness of the vote in the House. As
Mr. Lincoln viewed the situation it was
necessary to secure the favor of three
additional members in order to pass the
measure. He sent for Dana and made him
his authorized agent to procure these
votes.
Dana went to two Representatives from
New York and one from New Jersey to
solicit their favor for the amendment.
They each made demands for patronage
in return for their support, and
to each of them Mr. Dana gave
the assurance of the appointments
sought. The amendment passed by the
aid of these Congressmen, and in the cases
of two of them Mr. Lincoln promptly
made good the promise of his emissary.
In the case of the third the appointment
could not be made immediately for want
of a vacancy. Before the expected vacancy
occurred Mr. Lincoln was assassinated
and Andrew Johnson had become Presi
dent,
When Mr. Dana went to Andrew John
sen and stated to him the facts affecting
tbe appointment and reminded him of
Mr. Lincoln's solemn promise that it
should be made, and of the reason and re
sult of that promise, Johnson refused to
make good the martyred President's word,
upon the ground that "in the course of
his experience he had observed that such
bargains tend to immorality."
It may not be amiss to note that after
thirty-two years of reflection Mr. Dana
states it as his profound conviction
that this political incident "was
one of the most judicious, humane
and wise pieces of executive authority
that I ever assisted in or witnessed." The
question which it presents is one which
the political theorists and moral
ists of the present should ponder
deeply upon; which, was right, Abra
ham Lincoln or Andrew Johnson
in their judgment of the wisdom
and morality of the means by which slav
ery was abolished throughout our Nation
as revealed by this object lesson in the
practical politics of the time ?
THE SUNDAY CALL.
The particular feature of to-morrow's
issue of TnK Call will be the thrilling and
fascinating story of the raising of tbe
stars and stripes at Monterey just fifty
years ago next Tuesday. In this latter
day the narrative of that critical event in
tbe history of California reads more like, a
romance than the mere recital of histori
cal data. Three of the men who were
present at that memorable event, and they
are among the very few living eye-wit
nesses, tell the story in their own lan
guage. It is a story full of living, human
Interest, and one that no person will care
to miss reading. The narrative has been
faithfully and handsomely illustrated.
Aside from this there will be the usual
and many new and novel features in The
Call to-morrow. It will be, as ever, dis
tinctively a California newspaper, in fact
THE Bunday newspaper of the State.
ALTGELD'S BED FLAG.
It is to be heped that Altgeld will fail of
his purpose to begin and conclude the
business of the Chicago convention in one
day by gagging niÃ opponents. No politi
cal party furnishes a precedent for Biich
action. The people of this country abhor
the "gag," and their contempt for those
who would use it is boundless. Political
and Teligious differences are laid aside
when an attempt is made to apply the
'â¢gag" and as one man the people rise in
protest against it. The gag is the weapon
of the coward and the assassin, and only
he who ia conspiring to deprive others of
their rights ever attempts to use it. The
right of free speech and a fair hearing is a
fundamental principle of this Government,
and Americans everywhere are to-day cel
ebrating the one hundred and twentieth
anniversary of the rooting and grounding
of that right in the hearts of the people,
and without reference to party affiliation
tbe demand comes tbat there shall be fair
play In the Chicago convention.
Governor Altgeld is the leader in the
move to gag ail who are opposed to certain
party declarations, and his methods are
the methods of tbe anarchist. As Gov
ernor of Illinois he may pardon the ene
mies of law and order when they are con
victed. That is a matter between himself
and the people of hi* State, but when he
undertakes to gag representatives from
every State who are in Chicago at the
bidding of their constituents, he should
know that he is under the condemnation
of every liberty-loving man, woman and
child in all this broad land. Mr. Altgeid
should know that the people of the United
States are not ready to substitute anarch
ism for republicanism; that they are not
ready to remove George Washington from
their hearts to make room for Herr Most,
and that they are not ready to furl the
stars and stripes and unfurl the red flag of
arson, murder and plunder.
It is not now a question of "silver crank"
or "goldbug" supremacy in the Chicago
convention, so far as the general public is
concerned, but it is a question of right
and justice. The people have not forgotten
that the men for whom Altgeid opened the
doors of the penitentiary that they might
resume their warfare upon society repre
sented in the Haymarket riots tbe same
principles of government that Aitgeld is
tryine to force reputable citizens of every
State in the Union to accept. But surely
there is enough true American manhood
in the Chicago gathering of Democrats to
overwhelm the audacious representatives
of red fiagism. If there is not, let the
word Democrat, stand hereafter for every
thing that is at war with law, order and
good government.
There are at least ten chances to one
that the best oration on this Fourth of
July will be delivered by some obscure
young orator in a country town and will
never be reported. To famous orators
such occasions are productive mainly of
mere perfunctory speeches, but to youth
they are full of inspirations and not in
frequently prompt genuine eloquence.
While we are exalting in the greatness
of our country let us not forget the illus
trious men who founded it nor the heroes
who defended it and preserved it for the
perpetuation of our independence and
prosperity.
Our patriotism will be as warm as that
in the East, but our weather will be cooler,
and there is comfort in that.
The monument to Jefferson Davis may
be a fine piece of work, but it will never be
anything more than a tombstone.

at present, because the crater has not done
business at the old stand for eighteen months,
excepting an early and brief spring opening it
beld in January. The volcano is the great at
traction for tourists, and the first question that
is asked a stranger in Honolulu is, "Have you
seen the volcano?" The lake of fire was the
pride of the Kanaka's heart, but to-day, like
the Democratic party, its fire is out, and only a

blackness as a sort of bluff at activity. Mr.
Jones says that the Japanese are very much in

THE NATION'S BIRTH.
Upon Olympian heights in solemn state.
Three censors stood, whose eyes were all aglow,
And tnese were History and Time and Fate,
Watching tbe nations en the plain below.
There flowed the stream of ages, and it ran
O'er silent sands with wrecks of empire strewn:
Where ruin marked the handiwork of man,
And cities crumbled in the dust alone.
Upon the left a mist hung in the airâ
"Canst tell," asked Time, "what rests beneath
the haze â¢"
And History shook 4ier head ; ' 'I do not dare
To solve the secrets of creation's days."
There rose thp pyramids from out the plains
To tell of Egypt's glory and decay;
Where the dumb Sphinx with eye of cold disdain
Faced forty centuries of Time's delay.
And in the glare of the remorseless sun
There bleached the bones of long forgotten hosts,
On fields where hate and pride the conquest won,
To make a nation's tyrannies their boast.
Where the rude sword was master of the law,
Holding Its right in undisputed lease;
Where victors, glutted with the spoils of war,
Disdained to use tae perfect glfto of Peace.
Thus mighty kingdoms tottered to their fall;
The work of ages shattered in a day,
Because the blinded builders of tbe wall
Discarded marble to make room for clay.
Beholding this. Time's bosom swelled with pride:
"Where lives the nation that survives with me â¢"
And at his side the voice of Fate replied,
"'Twaa born to-day: the Nation of the Free."
And at its birth a flag unknown before
Unfurlea its flashing colors to the sun,
Till power to crush it was proclaimed no more,
And right to bear it was forever won.
And those who fell beneath its tattered folds,
Fire-scathed and battle-scarred, are with us now;
For with the flight of those unshackled souls,
A touch immortal pressed the martyr's brow.
Then ceased the clash of conflict, and the chain
That bound the limbs of valor was undone;
Men reared to Liberty a lasting fane,
A nd Peace looked down upon a conquest won.
Then the broad land knew plenty and content;
The swift loom hummed, the cheery anvil rung;
In other climes the ear of Hope waa bent
To catch Hie stirring strains which Freedom sung.
To-day a smile illumes tbe face of Fate,
The pen of History records us free,
And Time looks on this glorified estate,
But the beginning of a realm to be.
Then reign, O King! in thy accepted might.
While Peace shall live, and War no longer frown;
Thy scepter, naught but heritage of right,
The halo of eternal years thy crown.
Sak Davis.
AT YERBA BUENA FIFTY-SEVEN
YEARS AGO.
The first celebration of the Fourth of July at
Yerby Bueirawas in 1839, the families of all
the prominent residents being invited to the
festivities, which were under the management
of tbe Americans attached to the three or four
American vessels lying in the harbor.
The celebration was held at the residence of
Jacob P. Luse, situated at a point which is now
on Dupont street, between Washington and
Clay. The invitations extended to the persons
living about the bay were very generally ac
cepted.
Among the most notable persons present
were Don Joaquin Estudillo, with his beauti
ful wife and lovely daughter; Don Ignacio Mar
tinez, with his four handsome daughters; Cap
lain William Richardson of Sausalito, his wife
and daughter, who was one of the belles of the
country; Don Victor Castro aud his amiable
wife; the Sub-Prefect Don Francisco Guerrero
and his pretty wife; Alcalde Don Francisco de
Haro, with his charming daughters.
Salutes were fired from the vessels at noon
of the 4th. A grand dinner took place during
the evening, iollowed by a ball which was
kept up till dawn of the next day.
LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
FATE OF DEMOCRACY.
Galvanic Suow of Life Onlyâ A Doomfdx
Prophecy.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sib: It
does seem to me past belief that men of sense
can be led as they are led all the time by
shams which mere boys uot yet in their teens
should see through at once in times like those
in which we now live. As I write to-night
(July 2) tbe air throbs with threats from Dem
ocratic throats that gold shall not rule the
party. Grant that those wbo shout so loud and
vex the air with threats so dire mean to down
the gold power. It is just here that these men
play the fool: The gold forces go there for
the sole purpose of being put down â to blind
the fool people. No man who thinks can fail
to see that two goid candidates would divide
the gold vote, and gold men have no party â
they are for goid just as railroad men are lor
their own schemes.
Let us look at the fight now on at Chicago in
alight as broad and clear as that of high noon.
To divide silver men aud keep them apart is
the one task now tn hand by gold men. In
fact it is the sole hope left them. But as a part
of their nly scheme they must keep up a sham
fight for gold to fool the people, and, sad to
aay, the people are fooled â far more of them at
least than a man of sound sense would think
could be made fools of by such a trick. "Di
vide and conquer." It is an old rule. It works
well in tht! present game of politics.
But my aim at this time is just to say a word
on this point and pass on to quite another
thing ; I mean tbe fate of the Democratic party.
What I write here shall be the truth as near aa
I can see It and state it I trust the time is
now past when men who claim to be fair wilt
think it worth while to try to make the false
aeem to be the true. This is a time which does
in fact try men's uouis, aud they want the
trutb.
As I turn to the East in my thought to-night
I can see no hope for a silver Democratic can
didate for the Presidency in New York, New
Jersey or Connecticut, and of course not in
any other of tbe gold ruled States of the North
east. That means, if we take a full sense of
the change of political feeling now sweeping
over the land, that Democracy in all those
States at least will go to sleep this fall beside
its old-time foes, the Whigs, and be as dead ai
they are.
Silver will not save them in the South. It is
too late. Texas is gone. Men who know the
facts and will tell the trutb will say at once
that the gold Democrats of Texas have split
the party in twain where it was already safe
for tbe Populists. It is much the same in
Georgia, Alabama acd North Carolina. I
think these five great Southern States are lost
to Democracy. Populists in all the Btates will
unite with silver men on the terms proposedâ
the whole money question, but not silver
alone â at St. Louis July 22. They cannot and
will not unite with Democrats as a party on
any terms; they do not think of such a thing.
Nor will silver Republicans joiu them. Silver
Democrats of good sound sense can in fact
have no hope that they will win. Infatuation
now seems to possess them at the assembling
convention. But infatuation is a breath, soon
lost in thin air.
There will be a real unjon of silver forces at
St. Louis by the Populists and true silver men
from both old parties on joint candidates with
separate but uot antagonistic platforms. Good
Democrats will vote the Republican ticket.
Only infatuated partisan Democrats who think
they are silver men will vote the Democratic
ticket. Democracy will be third in the race
and will break its neck. It will disappear as a
National party next November.
I close with adoomful forecast of the fate of
Democracy, made in March, 1593, soon after
Mr. Cleveland was inaugurated, by Julius
Erickson, and a copy of it was filed with the
librarian at Washington at the time, and an
other copr was sent to the Arena Magazine
published in Boston. 1 can only give extracts
from it, for it tills three pages of the Arena, vol
10, No. 4, for September, 1894. It is entitled
"An Astrological Forecast of the Administra
tion of President Cleveland."
While I am not much addicted to astro
logical or any other kind of prophecy, bibli
cal or Chaldaic, 1 confess that this forecast
made a profound impression on my mind when
It was published in September, 1894, the more
so that at the time it was made, just after Mr.
Cleveland was inaugurated, it was the general
belief that he would have a prosperous career
and a successful administration of our National
affairs.
My first quotation is made from the third
paragraph, p. 537 : "The President's judgment
in many cases will be decidedly at variance
with the policy which the public will expect
to emanate from the bead of the Democratic
party," â¢ â¢ "and he will have a far more
troublesome, annoying and anxiously vexa
tious time than any President has had aince
Lincoln."
On p. 538, at the close of tbe eighth para
graph, it is said: "But the most disastrous
time of the whole will eventuate in 1896, and
the close of his term will witness the most
â¢tartllng changes in the political history of the
United State*. "
Room must be made for the whole of the
next (tae ninth) paragraph: "The indications
point to an entirely new party, the formations
of nev principles, new men and new ideae,
which will lead to the relegation of the Demo
cratic party to tne black forest of oblivion.
The Cleveland administration enters with the
blare oJ trumpets and a blaze of glory; but
will depart under a cloud of s mis ter conditions,
and at that eventful time the following pre
diction will be verified: The Democratic party
will fail to elect its candidate in 1896 if it
places one in the field."
It has seemed to me that this remarkable
forecast would prove to be very interesting
reading just as the Democratio National Con
vention is assembling in so much confusion at
Chicago. Joseph Asbuky Johnson.

AN EVERY-DAY DRESS FOR LIT
TLE GIRLS.
A simple little gown with a baby waist but
toned in the back is shown here. The sim
plicity of the design, in combination with its]
pieturesqueness, recommends it. The collar
may be made detachable, which is a feature
always appreciated, as two collars may be
used, making variety, and if one is washable
the usefulness of the gown is doubled.
A brown and white wool dress had one col
lar of brown satin, with a band of heavy
creamy lace laid an inch from the edge. The
other collar was of sheer white lawn, trimmed
with Valenciennes lace.
A plain myrtle green cashmere, with one
color of plaid silk and another of white lawn,
is very effective.
Wasn dresses of gingham are shown with
collars of the same trimmed with embroidery.
Blue cambric with collar of white piquet is a
pretty combination, and white piquet with
collar of blue or pink cambric is always
dainty.

We are glad to notice that the San Francisco

to run the Republican National candidates at

a class of journalism, especially In the larger

this frank old expression of political prefer

sidered nominally Republican, or nominally
Democratic. We remember, just slightly, the
times and conditions of New York during the
so-called "Albany regency." While the Cros

Thurlow Weed was conducting the Albany

Ice-water is as dangerous as strychnine dur.

poison. The death of General John McComb
Is directly traceable to immoderate drinking
of that beverage. He was in poor health, and
the shock produced by drinking copious
drafts of ice-water brought his disease to a
climax from which he had not the strength to
rally. Ice-cold water Is only safe when drunk
in moderation and slowly, so as not to shock
or chill the stomach.

UNRUH AND

Judge Joachimsen, After Hearing Evi
d nee, Reduces the Bail to
$5000.
The aftermath of the shooting and dis
play of revolvers in Judge Slack's court
room Thursday morning was fines of $100
and $250 imposed, respectively, upon At
torney James L. Crittenden and Henry A.
I'nruh yesterday. Unruh submitted to
the decision, but Crittenden gave notice
that he would appeal to the Supreme
Court.
When the contempt case of the two per
sons was called a large crowd was present,
drawn there by the association of the al
most tragic affair of the day before, when
Emma Ashley made a frenzie J attempt to
kill E. J. Baldwin and avenge the alleged
wrongs of her sister Lillian.
Crittenden asked the Judge what the
charge against him was. He was told tha
the specific charge was coming into t c
court armed with a loaded pistol, and thai
he threatened to use it.
"I utterly disclaim having made any
threat of the kind, your Honor," he an
swered. "As to my carrying a pistol, I
claim that I have that right when travel
ing as a resilient outside of the City limits.
I have done so for years.
"Now, I claim that there can be no con
tempt because tnere was no intention to
commit contempt. The right to carry
firearms is guaranteed to every citizen by
the constitution of this country and never
has been disputed except as to concealed
weapons. And that right exists in my
favor wherever I may be. The only ques
tion is as to whether or not an attorney
should, on entering a courtroom, disarm
himself when he has no intention whatever
aguinst the dignity of the court.
11 1 also deny that I threatened any one.
My own life was threatened when I en
deavored to prevent an assault. I saw an
unseemly scuffle going on between a man
and a woman. I separated them and the
man had a pistol. He stood with it in his
hand and endeavored to cock it. Seeing
that and also seeing that the weapon was
leveled directly at me 1 put my band be
hind me, and only to protect myself. It
was impossible for me to determine
whether Mr. Unruh intended to use the
weapon or not; I only saw him with it.
"I would like to ask. Is an attorney to
be at the mercy of others by being unable
to protect himself? I have been shot sev
eral times, an I my arms are almost use
less as a means of defense, so I have
to protect myself in some other way. For
thirty years and during the war I have
carried a pistol, and I have only had occa
sion to draw it once. On that occasion I
did not kill the person, although all per
sons present said I ought to have done so.
"Had this young woman killed Mr.
Baldwin â and I want to say right here I
am glad she did not â the plaintiff would
have lost all her rights in this case and
all litigation would have boen ended. So
there was certainly no motive for a con
spiracy on the part of the lady, her sister
or any one else to kill Mr. Baldwin. â¢
"And, had I intended to use my weapon
upon Mr. Unruh, I could have done so
fatally without any difficulty. Those who
know me know tbat I can use a pistol.
But I did not so intend, but merely to pro
tect myself. My life has been threatened
in court and Judges have known of my
taking means to protect myself and have
not obj- cted. Once, in the United States
court, this occurred and Judge Hoffman
knew of my being armed. It is the same
for me to carry a pistol as it is for other
men to carry a penknife, and I have a
pocket mad" for it in my pantaloons.
Without my pistol I am at the mercy of a
stronger man."
Henry Unruh on being asked what he
had to say, replied that while he was
wrenching the revolver from Emma Ash
ley he heard a voice behind him saying,
"Let that woman alone." He feared an
attack in the rear, and jerking the
weapon from the woman he turned around
and saw Crittenden facing him and pre
paring to draw his weapon. He had no
intention of firing.
"But did you not stand with ihe pistol
pointing at Mr. Crittenden ?" asked Judge
Slack.
"I was so disturbed I did not exactly
know what I did. I only saw Mr. Crit
tenden's movements and thought 'If he
draws on me I am done for.' I neld the
pistol up asid did not point it at Crit
tenden.
"Your Honor," said the attorney, "saw
Mr. Unrun point the weapon at me. I
prefer to have your statement."
"As I held the pistol pointing up in the
air," said Unruh, "I was wondering what
kind of a gun it was, and if it would be
useful in case I should be obliged to use
it."
"I saw Mr. Unruh standing on the floor
with the pistol pointed at Mr. Critten
den," observed Judge Slack. "He prob
ably in his excitement did not know that
he was doing so, bat he was cenainly ;n
that position. It is necessary for me to
preserve the dignity of this court and to
inflict punishment for what occurred here
yesterday. I have no feeling other than
as an officer of justice."
"The greatest fault of Mr. Crittenden lay
in bringing a loaded pistol into court. No
attorney, nor any other person, shall
bring a weapon here with my knowledge.
The court is perfectly able to protest, its
officers from harm, if its attention is called
to any threats made against any
one. Mr. Crittenden, as an officer of this
court, should know this. By threats in
this instance I refer to the attempt of Mr.
Crittenden to draw a weapon. At. to Mr.
Unruh, I saw him point the pistol at the
attorney, and I cannot be mistaken. His
arm was extended and the weapon was on
a level with his eye. The action was un
mistakably threatening.
"1 shall therefore impose a fine of $100
on Mr. Unruh and one of $250 on Mr.
Crittenden, or imprisonment in the Coun
ty Jail at the rate of one day for every $1
of the tines. "
Unruh stated through his attorney that
he would submit to the decision, but Crit
tenden informed the court that he de
clined to pay the line and would appeal to
the Supreme Court Upon this Judge
Slack ordered him into the custody of the
Sheriff.
"Does your Honor wish to humiliate
me?" asked Crittenden. "I have a little
money myself and 1 can furnish ample
security for my appearance here. I am
not going to run away."
"I have no such desire, Mr. Crittenden,"
answered the court. "1 will slay execu
tion until Monday next so as to give you
time to prepare."
This ended the contempt proceedings for
the day, and the parties, with their friends,
filed out of the courtroom. Attorney Crit

would test the constitutionality of the

HELD FOR TRIAL.
Judge Joachimsen Fixes Ball In
Emma Ashley's Case at
35000.
The story of Emma A. Ashley's attempt
upon the life of "Lucky" Baldwin was re
peated over and over by a dozen witnesses
before Police Judge Joachimsen yesterday
afternoon.
Emma A. Ashley sat before the court a
speechless and seemingly distraugt lis
tener. Lilian Ashley sat with her, an
alert and an xious sister and friend. She
took the stand, also, in her defense. Bald
win also was called to the stand by the de
fense and testified that he not only had
never given Emma Ashley any provoca
tion for tier attack upon him, but that he
had never spoken to her in his life previous
to the sbootiner.
Baldwin sat "to the left of the Judge's
bench in one of the first rows of jury
chairs. He wore a long, gray overcoat and
dandled bis shining silk hat upon his
knee, placid, calm and at ease. Lilian
Ashley when she took the stand brushed \
his clothes with hers.
The impression made upon tte mind
of every man and woman present in the
courtroom by Emma A. Ashley as she sat
through the long afternoon gazing with
absent eyes upon the ceiling, weeping at
intervals, was that of a woman whose
mind had given va/. She was dressed in
black with a somewhat worn white straw
hat. Lilian was dressed in her accus
tomed black, black hat and black veil.
After hearing all the evidence Judge
Joachimsen fixed the bail at $5000.
The Scene in Judge Joachimsen's Court When Emma Ashley Was Arraigned for Trying to Kill
Lucky Baldwin.
The defense was conducted by General
Robert A. Frederick an' l Mr. Van Wyck
of Crittenden <fe Van Wyck.
Mr. Crittenden, who represents Lilian in
ncr suit for damages, could not appear,
being under the ban for contempt of
court. â¢
The first witness was Attorney A. G.
Barnett He was in tbe courtroom at the
time of the shooting and before. He no
ticed Miss Ashley sitting outside the rail
near Mr. Baldwin. She was looking in
her lap, and was smiling. He described
the bearing of the attorneys in the trial
toward each other as being notably pleas
ant.
They were questioning the witness, Lil
ian Ashley, about the photographs with
the curled nair, ana there was some pleas
ant repartee. Suddenly MiBS Ashley arose
with her two hands clasped about the re
volver and. still smiling, fired. He de
scribed the scene of confusion that fol
lowed. Miss Ashley, as Mr. Unruh grasped
her hands, began to cry with something
like terror.
Henry A. Highton, Mr. Baldwin's attor
ney, was the next witness. He was ques
tioned particularly as to Miss Ashley
havinc taken a seat awsiv from her sister
and near Mr. Baldwin during the last two
or three days of the trial. He hnd spoken
about it to Mr. Crittenden. He also no
ticed that she was reading a book, which
he tools to be the Bible, and he considered
her doing so as being a mere pose.
(J. A. Lee, a reporter on the Report, was
the most important witness for the prose
cution. He interviewed Miss Ashley almost
immediately upon her being booked in
the City Prison. She said to him, as he
testified, 'I tried to do a Christian act, I
tried to kill a seducer; I tried to kill the
man who ruined my sister. I failed. It
was God's will."
Mr. Lee was asked as to whether Miss
Ashley appeared to be in a state of mental
distiess or excitement at the time. He
said that that was a matter of opinion,
but to him she appeared to be one of the
coolest persons he had ever seen under
such circumstances.
James R. McElroy, clerk in Judge
Slack's court, told the story of the shoot
ing again. While Unruh was wrestling
with the woman for possession of the re
volver he sprang to him and demanded
the weapon. When Unruh secured it he
handed it over to the witness. It con
tained four loaded cartridges and one
empty shell. The white-handled revolver
was shown him and he identified it.
To Mr. McElroy Miss Ashley seemed a
quiet and rather innocent young woman.
He had remarked, after hearing her tes
tify in her sister's behalf, that she was
"rather light." By that he did not mean
that she was mentally unbalanced, but
only that s c had not much force.
H. A. Unruh, E. J. Baldwin's business
agent, told the story aeain.
He had been suspicious of Miss Ashley
since she took the seat near and to the
back of his chief. He was lacing the
Judge when the shot was tired, and spring
ing up he saw the woman with a smoking
revolver held with boil 'Kinds within two
or three feet of "Luck." Baldwin's head.
He sprang forward, grasped the weapon,
turned its muzzle toward the ceiling, and
tried to looaen her grip upon it. She re
sisted. He heard some one behind him
crying, "Let that woman alone! Let that
woman alone I" This nerve.i him to a
greater effort and he wrested the weapon
from the woman's Lands.
The witness described how Miss Ashley
sat with the handbag in her lap, In which
she carried her Bible and her revolver to
gether. He said he had long had a sus
picion of the contents of that bag.
Judge Slack told the story again. In
the confusion that followed the shooting
there were other actors, he said, who took
his attention from the principals (referring
to Mr. Crittenden and iiis revolver).
Judge Slack testified tbat while Emma
Ashley was on the stand as a witness in
the case before him he had noticed a
queer look in her eye. He could not say
that it was an unnatural look.
She attracted his attention again when
she changed her seat in the courtroom,
chiefly from the fact of her eating candy
Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria.
during the court proceedings. Again his
attention was attracted by her reading the
Bible on the evening before the shooting.
Her actions during tbe excitement imme
diately following the shooting led him to
the conclusion that she was mentally un
balanced.
A police officer dug the ball out of the
plaster in the wall. He testified that it
was lodged but three or four feet from the
floor on a line from where Emma Ashley
was standing and directly over where
Lucky Baldwin had been seated.
The ball was offered in evidence and as
it was held up in the attorney's fingers
Emma Ashley's eyes turned toward it
with the first look of interest they had
shown since the hearing began. Lucky
Baldwin also looked at the little missive
curiously. This ended the case for the
people.
Mrs. Gilmore, matron at the City Prison,
was called for t c defense. Her testimony
was given in such guarded fashion that it
placed a labor upon the attorneys to gain
from her the information they desired or
that she had to give. She told about how
the defendant had walked the floor sing
ing "Nearer, My God, to Thee," and vet
she said her conduct did not denote any
extraordinary nervousness or excitement.
She insistsd tbat Miss Ashley's conduct
was in no wise remarkable, taking the cir
cumstances into consideration.
Under direct questioning by the attor
neys for the defense, however, she ad
mitted that when the defendant was first
brought to ncr she had said that this
(meaning the pri^n) was not the place
for her; that she should be taken to the
Receiving Hospital as an insane patient.
Deputy Sheriff Finn accompanied Miss
Ashley from the courtroom to the City
Prison. He testified that she wept and
complained bitterly. "He has treated me
cruelly," she said. "I have had charge of
his sick child for a longtime. Last night
I thought it was going to die." She asked
lepeatedly for her Bible, was crying and
very excited.
E. J. Baldwin, mnch to bis astonish
ment, was now called to the stand. He
was asked if he had ever given Emma A.
Ashley provocation in any way for the at
tack she had made upon him. Mr. Bald
win, drumming with his lingers upon the
arms of the witness-chair, declared that
he had not; that he did not know her;
that he knew of no reason why she should
have assaulted dim.
Lillian A. Ashley took the stand. What
ever she may have been she was here a
very subdued, weary, anxious and sad
hearted young woman. Baldwin, in the
front row of the jury chairs, sat within a
few feet of her. Frequently during her
recital she looked toward him. Without
apparently attempting to escape her direct
glance he looked steadfastly, but rather
indifferently than otherwise, away from
her.
This, in answer to her attorney's ques
tions, was Lill'an Ashley's story: "My
sister lives with me at 819 Larkin street.
Hhe has been the constant attendant of
my little fatherless child since she came
to me over two years ago. Especially has
she been devoted to the child during her
two weeks of illness.
"The child is now seriously sick with a
fever. For two nights preceding this affair
my sister did not, I am sure, have more
than two hours' sleep. We were both up
at nights with her. My sister has taken
very iittle nourishment; almost none.
We lived meagerly at all times, as we have
no means. Our bill of fare consists chiefly
of bread and butter and tea, of which, as 1
say, my sister during the past few days
has scarcely partaken at all.
"As I look back at it now I can see how
really ill she was, for she has acted very
strangely. I thought at the time that it
was because of her distress over the child's
illness. She has cried a great deal, has
quoted Scripture and spent much time in
prayer. Before we left for the courtroom
<>n Thursday morning she knelt on the
floor and offered a long prayer.
"Then she went to the baby in her bed,
1 kissed her passionately, saying. 'Good-by,
little darling, I do hopi' I may see you
again.' She had also knelt in prayer
upon rising in the morning. Yes, my sis
ter has always Deen of a very religious
turn and is given to quoting SciiDture,
but this was different. Before her reli
gious expressions had a time and a place
in keeping â chiefly of a Sunday.
"Her conduct was so peculiar that it
worr ied me, and I said to her, 'Sister, you
are ill and you should stay here. I am
sure you are ill.' But 3he would not do
so. She said, "I want to be with you.'
"We went to the courtroom together
and -he took a seat outside the railing. I
went on the witnesâ stand and I did not
notice her again until Mr. Baldwin was
struggling with her. lam sore my sister
was madly insane when she fired that
shot. When I went to her in the matron's
room in the City Prison, she came to me,
placed her hands upon my shoulders and
said, 'God is love, God is supreme love.'
Miss Ashley was subjected to a long
cross-examination. The Bible that has
figured in the case was shown her. On
the flyleaf a half-tone picture is pasted,
pur.ly covering the name A. L. Ashley.
The witness testified thai the Bible was
her own when il was purchased in 1891,
and that she had written :he name on the
flyleaf, but that the booK now belonged to
her sister through ngtii of possession, she
having used it so much.
She, Emma, had pasted the picture there.
It was the picture of her pastor back in
the Massachusetts village home. The wit
ness explained that a though her name
was L. A. Ashley, g sometimes
wrote it "A. L.' S; c declared that
although she shared a small
room with her sister and that they
slept in the same bed she had never seen
the revolver her sister carried, nor did she
know that she had brought her Bible to
court in the reticule until she saw her read
it there. When they left their room that
morning Emma hud turned back in the
hallway lor something she said she had
forgotten.
Prosecuting Attorney Dare then went
into the subject of the fare at the Ashley
table, and when the witness repeated the
sta ement that her sister did not have
sufficient nourishment he asked the court
to take judicial notice of the defendant's
physical condition, and there rested.
"We ask the same of the court," said
Mr. Van Wyck. "We will ask me defend
ant to rise."
The woman stood up and swung herself
"lowly around that the court might m
form itself fully. She was a most un
happy looking young woman, and cer
tainly there were lines in her big round
face that might indicate both sleepless
nights and scanty fare. Her face that baa
been white as paper at the beginning of the
bearing was now red with silent weep
ing. '
Dr. William Burch was the unexpected
witness. He is a recent comer and is fill
ing the pulpit at Calvary Presbyterian
Church during the absence of Dr. Hemp
hill. Both the Ashley girls have attended
the church, but he aid not know them by
name. Hf chanced into the courtroom
yesterday afternoon and was surprised
to discover one of his flotk on trial on
the serious charge of attempted murderâ
the principal in the latest sensation of the
day. He asked the right to speak to her
and subsequently became her most im
portant witness. He -aid that the young
woman at tne bar had twice spoken in
meeting at the church, and that she gave
him the impression at ihe time that she
was suffering from religious mania. Her
talk was wild and Hysterical. He had
mentioned the circumstance to members
of the church.
Sidney Van Wyck, her counsel, took the
stand and told of how he met the youne
woman in the corridor of the City Hall
just after the shooting and when she was
on the way to the City Prison. She was
very much excited and talking almost in
coherently. He was sure she did not
know what she was doing. He stopped
I her, and looking in her eyes asked her if
she did not Know him. She replied that
she did. He asked her to tell him his
name. She said she iould not recall it.
He went with her to the City Prison
and there himself heard Matron Gilmore
say that she did not belong there; that
she should be taken as an insane patinte
to the Receiving Hospital.
That completed the testimony. It was
6 o'clock, and the speech-making was
made short.
Prosecuting Attorney Dare said the evi
dence was direct and sufficient upon which
to hold the defendant for trial. There was
plenty of evidence of premeditation. Had
her bullet caused death as she intended
she would unquestionably be Jield for
murder.
General Priedrich for the defense held
that the woman should be released and
held under a proceeding in insanity.
There was no premeditation, as tbe de
fendant was not a responsible person. No
jury could be found on earth tbat would
convict her. E. J. Baldwin had himself
declared there could be no motive.
Judje Joachimsen said that he could
not allow sentiment to enter into his
judgment; he must hold the defendant for
a trial by jury in the Superior Court and
he must fix bail in such sum as would in
sure protection against a repetition of such
dangerous use of firearms by the defend
ant. He named a sum at $10,000, but be
fore the judgment was written cut it to
$5000.
Miss Ashley was taken bacfc to prison,
weeping as she went. The sisters kissed
each other affectionately in the court
room, as Lillian lingered behind a few mo
ments to talk with her counsel about the
possibility of securine bail.

r To the Editor of the San Frandtco Callâ Sir:
There were two objects in view in sending out
the postal-cards reierred to in your paper this
morning. The first was, as stated in the card
itself, that the defendants in default could not
come into court and plead excusable neglect
as a reason why default should be set aside;
tne second was inspired through positive pity
for some of the defendants in the case who had
been led to believe by the false statements of
scheming, avaricious pettifoggers who repre
sent (hie) certain alleged defense unions, com
prised partly of occupants of our ranch, but
chiefly of those who have not any property
anywhere, that this suit would te defeated in
an hour after they had set their "windmills"

MONEY AND FRANCHISES
__________
The Roll May Present an In
crease of Twenty-Five
Million Dollars.
THE VALUATION IS $352,000,000.
The Board of Equalization Will Re
ceive Many R- qu<s>s for
Redaction.
Next Monday at 11 a. m. Assessor Siebe
will turn over to the Board of Supervisors
fifty-four real estate and seventeen per
sonal property volumes, constituting the
assessment-roll of this year.
Last year the valuation of the real estate
and personal property of San Francisco
was $327,000,000. The Assessor was not
prepared yesterday to say what valuation
would be shown in the roll now com
pleted, so far as assessments are concerned,
but w.ich are not computed.
There may be an increase that will
cause surprise in the community. For
severol months the Grand Jury has been
urging the Assessor to use all diligence in
assessing personal property, such as fran
chises and ether securities, which have
hitherto escaped taxation.
Assurances received by the jury were
that a great effort would be made in this
direction. The Assessor's attention was
directed time and again to the discrepancy
which existed in the statements filed by
tbe banks with the Bank Commissioners
and the returns ma<fe to the Assessor. It
is known now that a very large increase
has been made in the bank assessments.
The Grand Jury at Us session last Thurs
day evening was informed that a large in
crease would be reported, but the Assessor
ccmid only approximate figures, as the
computation had not been made.
Information secured by The Call yes
terday from various sources leads to the
belief that the valuation of the real and
personal property will reach the figure of
$352,000,000.
Complaint of overvaluation will surely
be made to the Board of Supervisors. It
s unde-stood that the banks will appeal to
the Supervisors for relief from what they
consider extraordinary assessments. The
Supervisors sitting as a Board of Equali
zation will have plenty of work to per
form.
Next Monday a resolution will be
adopted authorizing the employment of
six clerks to receive applications for reduc
tion.
In the Assessor's office clerks will be
busy all day to-day and to-morrow ni^hi
footing up the roll. Apart from the figures
of valuation there will be statistics re
garding the amount of capital and the
number of men employed in the manufac
turing industries of San Francisco.

Day.
There was a patriotic gathering last
night at Metropolitan Temple. It was
under the auspices of the Young Men's
Catholic Union.
REV. JOSEPH F. BYRNE, WHO DELIVERED THE ORATION.
The absurd idea of the existence of any
hostility upon the part of Ir:-sh Catholics
toward the Government of the United
States was indignantly refuted by ex-
Judge J. F. bullivan in his introductory
address.
"I bid yon all welcome to this entertain
ment," he said. "You know the purposes
of the union 'o be of a fraternal character.
It has no political connections, but believes
in the moral, social and intellectual eleva
tion of Catholic young men, with the idea
of making them good citizens of this great
Republic.
"Catholics in their relations to the
American Kepublic are OK. It is true
that the cburcli has placed the people
under many obligations. We render a
willing relicious alJegeance to the Pope of
Rome, but we have been among the first
to sacrifice blood and treasure in the de
fense of our civil and religious liberty.
".Let us, then, be tolerant in our treat
ment of our neighbors."
After the introductory address came a
contralto solo by Miss Nellie Gallagher;
the reading of the Declaration of Indepen
dence, by Ben L. McKinley; a tenor solo
by David Manlloyd, and "the following
original poem by Charies D. South:
THE FATHERS.
Swells loud the pa-an of a gretefa] nation
To Him who raised from out a world of sea
A world whereon He planned the matchless
structure
Of fair Columbia's home of liberty! â¢. <
From sands where Maine first, halls day's radiant
pilgrim
To seas that wash our day's last glided crag.
Praise be to Him and praise be to the fathers
Whose souls still sentinel our stainless flag!
To-day our great Republic's heart rejoices:
Nor turns the mill, nor speeds the loom to-day!
A day with skies writ o'er in glowing history
Of those who struck the tyrant's chains away;
Who dared defend the cause of downtrod justice:
- Who dared demand the God-given rights of
men:
Who flung defiance to the raging lion
â¢ And lashed him. crippled, bleeding to his den.
To-day, o'er all the land in town and hamlet.
The starry banner waves in ecstacy!
To-day the cannons' mighty thund'rine voices
- Roll to the clouds the Joy-notes of the free.
To-day we gather once again the myriads : -''â¢ "â â 
An l to the same high cause allegiance swear
Thai blazed upon the banners of the fathers
And shines in souls of freemen where.
Be, then, the lessons of those patriot fathers
Our ceaseless guide while flows the lde or years,
And lightning swift the doom that shall be meted
When aught that savors tyranny appears.
For no; aloi.e from high upon the ramparts
shall eyes discern and mark our country's foes
'Tis not the king we fear, with hosts in armor,
Come, trumpeted, to wage in deadly blows.
It Is the monster hydra of corruption,
With sting as fell as a word -stroke of the foe;
Ours to keep bn: the iron of our power - â  â¢
And sear where justice strikes the telling blow
And when acenrs'd monopoly's black fingers
The people's rights would rend and tear a way,
Be his us dire a (ate as ioul oppression
' Sank under la our brave forefathers' day.
And, long as time exists and cod-like actions
Fire men to emulate In need's dark nlgtu;
As lonÂ« as on some Cuba's ha?k the tyrant
Wltn bladf of hate his red decree shall write;
AS ions: as despot hand shall wield a scepter,
l'ervertlnit scripture on the rights of Kings;
As long as men shall groan beneath man's thrall
dom
And drink forced gull from evil's bitter springs.
So long shall our brave fathers' names be omens :
Their deeds be aye our boast, their fame our
pride;
They shall be auDg until their chorused praises
Be far -extending as the world Is wide.
And in the m?es of the Future's promise.
Whilst fair Columbia, coldess of the land.
Still guards our soil where smiling Peace and
Plenty
Their joys aud bounties pour from strand to
strand;
Whilst she is Joyed, feared, honored and respected,
.North, sou li. east, west, on land aud oti the sea.
Her blrthiiay skt.-s shall seem aglow w.tn lessons
1 o Â«ons how wrought their sires to make them
free.
Forever still expand our Nation's glory,
And never shadow dim one starry ray.
Till melt theae stars of union In the dawning
When Time is lost la Uod'a eternal day.
Ckaelks i>'. Sooth.
After a soprano solo, "The Star-spangled
Banner," by Miss Kathenne M. Black, the
Rev. Jo-eph F. Byrne delivered the follow
ing oration :
Mr. President, Rev, Fathers and fellow-citi
zens: We i.Hve assembled here this evening,
not for the purpose of using harsh words, not
for the purpose of giving veat to bitter feeling
against any one. but we have assembled here
as Catholics, Roman Catholics, American Ro
mnn catholics, to celebrate Jn a befiting man*
ncr the birthday of our National independ
ence.
John Adams, writing to a friend the day
after signing the Declaration, said the event
ought to be celebrated as the day of our deliv
erance by solemn acts of devotion to God Al
mighty. * It ought to be celebra'ed with pomp
and i> tirade, with shows, games, bells, bonfires
and illumination from one end of the Conti
nent to the other from this day forward and
forevermore.
Wo sat at the same table with John Adams
and signed the scroll that made us free. We
fought side by side with our fellow-citizens
and sealed with our blood the declaration of
the rights of freemen, and for over one hun
dred Tears we have joined with our fellow
fit'.zens in celebrating the great event which;
â¢n the cause of lifting nations out of I
ihralldom and of bringing down the blessings !
ol God Almighty upon us.
We are sad to-night to ttiink that herein
our own City, whoso streets have borne the
burden of the commerce of the world; that
here in our own City, who<e streets our fath
ers made, as conscientious, free-born Ameri
can citizens, on principle, we cannot join, as j
lias been our wont, in the solemn celebration |
of this day side by side with those who pro- j
[en patriotism, wtiile their sentiments toward I
our country are as far removed from its con
stitution and its free institutions as the stars
of the firmament whose light barely reaches
our orb. Therefore, we gather this evening on
our own behalf as Americans to sing the
glories of our Nation, to profess our fidelity to
the constitution, to renew our allegiance to
the flag that protects us and with one voice
and loud ace. aim to cry out with the upright
people of the land. "Long live the republic!"
A child must love its parents, and moreover
is bound to make manifest its love toward
those who brousrht ii into the world. By the
same law of God the citizen U bound not only
to love his country, but to manifest that love,
both by won! and by deed. Tnis love of coun
try is patriotism. '1 he deeds of daring done at
the risk of life and limb, the noble acts of self
sacrifice which illumine the historic page of i
every country, and w hich have been voiced in I
the sours of every nation, have been called
forth by the love of country, by virtue of j
patriotism.
The love of country is not checked by the
love of (jod, it is purificl and strengthened by
it. Patriotism does not die by the side of re
ligion, for these two virtues go hand in hand,
since they take their rise from the same virtue ;

Declaration of Independence at the Celebration in Metropolitan Temple.
of justice. The true patriot's battle-cry; in
every land has ever been, "'For God and my
country's Cause."
The fumily is the unit of society. Children
are born into the world, and the parents rule
over and govern them by a divine right. The
mother must nourish and train the little ones.
The father, according to the natural law, must
provide for them. The necessities of the hu
man family are so. many and so varied that
men must exchange with one another the
fruits of their toil that their wants may be
supplied. To accomplish this, rights mint be
preserved, order must be maintained, and j
dangers must be warded off. From this arises j
the social condition which is the natural con- !
dition of man. Families unite into a whole,
and delegate to others the power which they
themselves alone cannot exercise. Hence we
have the State which takes it's authority from
the same source as that of the familyâ Godâ
for all authority is from God. Therefore God
directs States, and, as individuals, States play
their part in carrying out the pans of the
providence of God. Therefore, the man who
loveÂ« his God loves his country well, and the
man who loves his country to the end hut
performs his duty to his God. Therefore the
mottoâ "God and Our Fatherland." Therefore,
the adherence of man to the teachings of him
doctrine litbe foundation of our modern
civilizationâ "Render to God the things that
are God's, and to Caesar the things that are
VIV-.HT's."
The State is composed of families", which
have been brought together in order thutall
may share In the prosperity and protection
which union brines. What marks the conrtnes
of a country and unites its people In a har
monious whole? Sometimes it is a mighty
river. Sometimes it is a mountain chain.
Sometimes it is great body of water. Some
times it is the persuasive power of powdfr.
What uni'ed the thirteen Colonies? What
unites and keeps uuited our many States and
Territories a id blends them all into one grand
country, despite the mighty rivers that flow
through their midst; dc>pite the great moun
tain chain, which on another continent would
mark the limits of petty kingdoms; despite
the angry conflict, which once threatened to
dismember them ? Freedom. Civil and re
'.iL'i 'tis freedomâ this is the magic spell which
holds together the sovereign Stated and blends
them all into one grand and mighty Nation.
1 need not rehearse for you the scenes of the
early history of our country. You are familiar
with them from childhood. I need not tell
you that the colonists who hrst came to our I
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATUBDAY, JULY 4, 1896.
snores, both Catholic and Protestant, came
because they had no civil liberty at borne and
because they could not worship God according
to their conscience. I may say, however, that
when their strong hands had torn down the
mights forests and when in the sweat of their
brow they bad tilled the soil, and when in
peace and contentment they were worshiping
God according to their own hearts the mother
country stretched forth her iron hand to rob
them of their civil rights, and they at once felt
thai their religious freedom was soon to follow.
Then did they arise in their mirht and cut off
the hand that would smite them. Civil and
religious liberty form the foundation upon
which rests our free institutions, and when
civil ana religious liberty cease to be then
shall our Nation cease.
I shnll not picture for you the scene that
presented itself when those noble men, the
fathers of our country, sat with drawn faces
and wlUi eyes weary with watching for some
ray of light through the dark clouds that hung
over them; that is beyond my power. But
what joy must have possessed each nianiy
heart when the vote was taken, and each felt
that It could beat in freedom; that the chains
of bondage were broken. Then did another
nation spring into lifeâ not a weakling, but
full of power; not unarmed, but prepared for
war. As Minerva did, full panoplied and with
the protecting JEgis forth from the brain of
Jupiter spring, so did our Nation from the
bruin of Britain, with the JEgiÂ» of liberty
about her.
In 1812 the young Nation was again forced
to exert herself, and cause her flag to be re
s pecied upon the seas.
Later on, in 1823, during the administration
of President Monroe, the allied powers met at
Verona and declared that the Cortes of Spain
seta bad example in government to the na
tions of Europe. They resolved that foreign
interference should bo used to reinstate Ferdi
nand and again place him upon his throne.
This was accomplished by France. Then came
the grand protest of President Monroe to the
allied powers, in which he declared:
Still later and in our own aay our ancient
enemy made the endeavor to encroach slightly
upou American soil. It fills every American
heart with joy, for it strengthens'hope in the
future of our country, to think that the Chief
Executive in this land, upheld by all the peo
ple, irrespective of politiciil creed'or party, de
clared that a such a movement on the part of
England could be looked upon by this Govern
ment only as an unfriendly act. * By a nia.-ter
stroke of diplomacy, Graver Cleveland caused
the Premier of England to affirm, what he be
fore denied, thai the Monroe doctrine Is a part
of international law.
We thank God tnat our country, though
young, is vigorous, and that she can bid the
terror of nations, the white-clad specter of tne
seas, remain within the confines of Albion's
Islet,
We are a great Nation, and with God's aid
we shall be greater still. In order that we
may be great we must preserve our free insti
tutions, we must preserve our civil and relig
ous liberty. We must protect the purity of
the ballot. We must see to it that those who
vote are sufficiently educated to know how to
use the franchise, and not to be dupes of un
principled men. We must see to it that those
who vote have hearts trained as well as minds,
so that they understand thai the man who sells
his vote sells his country; that the man who
uses office for his own aggrandizement, or for
the benefit of, or the enriching of his friends,
commits a crime against his country and a
sin against his God. Nor must we lose sight
of our traditions. Our doors have ever been
open to the oppressed oi all nations. If the
oppressed of the nations are fitted for citizen
ship, if they come here to work and to stay,
we Did them enter and remain. We desire no
parasites that would feed upon our prosperity.
We should be more solicitous about driving
from our midst those who have lived long
among us, I may say, who have lived long upon
us, without becoming citizens, than we should
be about closing our doors to those who come
in search of freedom. The day that we cease
to be the home of the free, that day shall we
cease to be the home of the brave, for it is our
freedom that has made us brave.
An American citizen! what a wealth of
meaning in the term! It stands for liberty.
It stands for freedom, it is respected abroad.
It is a power at home. It means that every
man in the land is a king, with the ballot for
his scepter. It means that every woman in the
land is a queen, and that the home adorned
with the jewels of free-born sons and daugh
ters is the throne, whereon both sit in power
and majesty. The Apostle Paul was proud oi
his title. "I am a Roman citizen," he ex
claimed, nor dared the Jew or Roman lay un
hallowed hands upon him. But if the Apostle
Paul thought it well to be a Roman citizen,
how proud should be every man who is able
to claim American citizenship? How proud
should be every apostle who preaches "The
freedom wherewith Christ hath made us free,"
when able to exclaim, "I am an American citi
zen!"
Long may America live. Long may she con
tinue to do the work that God has appointed
for her. Long may Columbia stand in the
midst of the nations, even as stands the great
Bartholdi statue, the gift of our sister repub
lic across the seas, holding aloft the torch of
liberty, which, like a blazing sun, pours over
the world the lijrnt and the heat and the
strength ot ireedom.

beaten the fastest vessels in the Bngar
fleet. During the last week or ten days
quite a number of sugar vessels have got
in, but all made remarkably long passages.
Some were out as many as thirty-five days,
while others were twenty-eight and thirty
days. The Spreckels is now out seven
days from Mahukona, and the betting is
that the brig will make the run inside of a
fortnight. She sails like a witch in all
kinds of weather, and no one knows better
than Captain Â£. M. Christiansen how to
get the last ounce out of her.
The Spreckels in one of the prettiest
brigs afloat and her master is justly proud
of her. Several trips ago he determined
lo get a snap shot of his vessel under sail.
Christiansen is an amateur photographer
and loses no chance to get a good picture.
He accordingly ordered a boat lowered,
and, with his camera under his arm, got
into it. He then dropped aptern, and after
many an attempt, finally secured a good
negative. Ihe brig was taken from astern
and it makes a very pretty picture.
There was a general exodus along the
water front yesterday. The ferry steam
ers were crowded on every trip during the
afternoon, and there was not a yacht but
was in commission. Commodore Bruce
went to Vallejo in the Rover, while Harry
Goodall ami a party of friends went up the
Sacramento in the Ripple. The City of
Puebla sailed for Puget Sound with the
members of the Golden Gate Commandery
aboard and a large number ol other pas
sengers. Among the latter was Colonel
J. G. Tobin, deputy collector of the port,
who is making an annual tonr of inspec
tion. He was accompanied by his wife.
The members of the commandery are going
to Alaska, and Captain Carroll of the
Queen will do his best to show them all
the sights.
The monitor Comanche was in gala
attire yesterday. Nearly all the members
of the Naval Battalion went out to her,
and for the next few days she will be their
home. There will be general practice drill
every day. and toward the end of the
week the vessel may go for a cruise around
the bay. The Charleston will he open for
inspection to-day and the launch Amy
will carry visitors to and from both her
and the Comanche.
The exodus from the City will continue
tonight. The members of the Third Bat
talion, First Infantry, N. G. C, will leave
for Stockton on the steamer T. C. Walker.
They are going 300 strong and expect to
make a fine showing in the capital city of
San Joaquin County.
The Hull (Eng.) News prints the follow.-
Ing marvelous story :
A Japanese diver, who fell overboard at
Thursday Island, had a marvelous escape. He
states that after swimming for two days and
two nights he reached a small island, and lived
there until he was rescued by a passing boat,
after four <-Â»ays' semi-starvation. A turtle came
ashore to l*y eggs and he captured her. He
lived on tne flesh until it became putrid, and
then he subsisted on the eggs.
The condition of the eggs most have

on passing the vessel, and Dr. Blue, as the

The Alleged Child-Beater Allowed to
Go Free by Judge Wallace.
John Bfc Clair, who was convicted in
the Police Court on a charge of crueity to
his child and sentenced to six months in
jail, was before Judge Wallace yesterday
on an appeal.
Assistant District Attorney Black ap
peared and said that he thought the pun
ishment fixed by the lower court was
excessive and that he would be satisfied
with the infliction of a fine. He thought
$60 was about the amount St. Clair should
pay.
Judge Wallace looked the papers in the
case through carefully and said that if a
fine was all that the prisoner deserved, a
nominal one would do, and so fixed the
amount at $1, which St. Clair paid.

brothers, Henry B. Crandali of West Oakland
and Bloom field P. Crandali of Enterprise, Buite
County, California. She leaves a host of friends,
who mourn her loss. She was a native of
Maryland. Her last hours were peaceful. She
was a sufferer Irom asthma for thirty-five
years.
A WELL-CONTESTED RACE
Jeffe Captured the 2:40 Trot at
Ingleside After a Stub*
born Battle.
A PROMISING TWC-YEAR-OLD.
Owybee Had a Gift of His Race.
Ruby M Was a Co
nundrum.
The elements have certainly been most
unkind in their dealings with the Pacific
Coast Trotting-horse Breeders' Associa
tion, for with one exception the weather
at Ingleside track has been more suitable
for snowballing than for light harness
horse sport. Yesterday huge fos banks
rolled in from the ocean, part of the time
obscuring a view of the hones, the wind
was chilling and the drivers looked as
t bough buffalo coats would be preferable
to their many colored silKen jackets. But
these serious setbacks were in a great way
offset by the character of the sport, which
was about the best of the meeting. Better
racing than that seen in the 2:40 trot
would be hard to find, five heats being
necessary to decide it. In the fourth heat
Jeffe and Faro Bank passed the wire in
such perfect alignment that the judges
were unable to separate them and decided
it a dead beat, although it looked as though
the former earned the decision.
Two bookmakers and an auction-pool
stand handled the coin. The wagering on
the "_':4o trot was especially heavy.
The hrst event of the day called was the
trotting stake for two-year-olds, best two
in three heats. It brought out in Owyhee,
a slaihing big Day by Charles Derby, a
most promising colt. In the first pools
sold he brought $10 against $6 for the field,
and the long-striding youngster placed
two straight heats to his credit without
even being extended in 2:34%â 2:33. High
land Lad, another very growthy colt from
the southern country, was second in each
of the beats trotted.
The s*ven starters in the 2:40 class for
trotters were next called. Before the first
heat the field sold favorite at $15, Jeffe,
who was strongly tipped, bringing $12,
and Athovis $7. Silver Queen drew 0.6
pole and led Jeffe until well on toward
the wire when she broke, and the Heat
went to Jeffe by a length in 2:2o}s. The
betting was now Jeffe $10. the held $5.
The favorite went out in the next heat
and looked to have it at her mercy, when
fifty yards from Â»he wire ehe went in the
air, and Clay 6 who was at his sulky took
the heat easily in 2:21%. After this things
were slightly mixed. Clay S sold choice
at $10. with Jeffe going for $6 and the field
$5. When McNair sent them away to a
pretty start for the third heat, Ciay S
showed the way to the baokstretch, where
he broke, losiuz several lengths. Faro
Bank, who was unsteady in the first heat,
now gained the pole and flattered his
friends by leading to the homestretch,
where he found some egg shells. Jeffe
now had firs*, position Â»nd in a very ex
citing finish Lafferty landed his horse
winner of the heat, a head before Ciay S
in 2:23%.
Jeffe again sold favorite after this im
pressive win at $10. with Clay S goiug for
?7 and the field $3. This next heat, the
fourth, resulted in a dead heat between
Jeffe and Faro Bunk, which two had been
the contending: horses throughout. Time,
2:23. Faro Bank now sold even up against
the field, but Jeffe simply paraded a^vay
with the field, passing the stand two
lengths in advance of Clay S in 2:25. Faro
'Bans broke just after turning the bend for
home.
Tlie trotters out of the way, the special
2:11' pace, with Javelin, Plunkett and
Ruby M, was next considered. Each heat
in this event was considered a race.
Javelin was favorite at 4 to 2 in the books
for the first heat, but Ruby M, driven by
"Jimmy" Sullivan, made a show of him,
winning in a jog in 2:l6}Â£. Receding from
favoritism in the books, Ruby did not
have any too much speed in the heat fol
lowing and hniÃhed a poor third. Javelin,
the favorite, passed the wire three lengths
in advance of Plunkett in 9:2o}^. Javelin
was unsteady in the third heat, and Ruby
M, who was eqtial favorite in the books
with him, won with something to spare
from Plunkett in 2:21.

SUICIDES OF THE YEAR.
One Hundred and Forty-Six Cases
Recorded at the Morgue in
This City.
Seven Hundnd and Forty-Five Deaths
Reported to the Coroner
During the Year.
Coroner Hawkins has had a busy twelve
months. The fiscal year ending June 30
shows 745 deaths reported at the Morgue,
or 109 more than the previous yeai.
Of the 745 deaths coming under the eye
of the Coroner 146 committed self murder.
Housewives head the list with ten, car
penters and laborers combined footing up
the same. The occupations of the unfor
tunate 146 are as follows:
Agents 2, architects 1, artists 2. bar
tenders 1, barbers 2, bed-makers 1, brew
ers 1. bricklayers 1. blacksmiths 1, butch

tailors 4, teamsters 3, upholsterers 1, un
dertakers 1. waiters 4, window-cleaners 1,
wrapping clerks 1, winegrowers 2.
The people who committed suicide dur
ing the twelve months just ended hail
from all parts of the globe. Continental
Europe furnished the biggest percentage,
Germany leading the list with thirty-three.
The nativity of the suicides is as follows:
Alsace and Lorraine 1. Austria 2, Canada
5, China 2, Denmark 5, England 7, France
t>, Finland 1, Germany 33, Holland 1. Ire
land 6, Italy 4, Japan 1, Mauritius Island 1,
Norway 4, Poland 1, Russia 1, Sweden 5,
Switzerland 1, United States 51, unascer
tained 8. Total 146.
Inability to Huh; successfully the battle
for bread caused 108 despondent mortals
to seek rest in the grave. Eleven com
mitted suicide because they did not Know
any better, while two found home life too
great a burden to bear. The complete list
of "causes" reads:
Domestic troubles 2, despondency 108,
intemperance 2, insanity 11, jealousy 5,
sickness t>, unknown 12: total 146.
Condition, color, religion and sex cut
quite a figure in the suicides of the past
year. Sixty-four married people found
life burdensome, the number of single per
sons seeking surcease from sorrow being
seven less than this. Tne complete record
is as follows:
Raceâ White, 142; yellow, 3; black, L
Sexâ Male, 125; Female, 21.
Condition â Married. 64; single, 57;
widows, 4; widowers, 11; unknown, 10.
Religionâ Christian, 138; Jewish, 5; Pa
gan, 3.
No report has yet been made of the
murders. The bloody record of the past
six months, however, leads Coroner
Hawkins to believe that the number will
far exceed that of any previous year.
IROQUOIS IN WAR PAINT
Will F.'ght the Proposed Extension
of the Geary - Street
Franchise.
At the meeting of the Iroquois Club last
night the action of the Supervisors in de
claring their intention togrint the Geary
street Railway an extension of its fran
chise was denounced and a committee ap
pointed to prevent the consummation of
the proposed action. In line with the dis
cussion on the subject the following reso
lution was adopted:
Whereas, The Boara of Supervisor at Its
last mv.-ting declared its intention of grant
ing a lranchise for a railway on Geary street
for a term of fifty years ; and whereas, the
present franchise does not empire for seven
years, be it therefore
R(,kq vol, That thei Iroquois Club call upon
the Democratic members of the board to op
pose and vote against the contemplated out
rage, and be it further
Retolved, That a committee of four be ap
pointed by the club to represent |it at the next
meeting of the board.
E. P. E. Troy, Max Popper, ex-Judge
Ferrai and Judge A. D. Lemon were ap
pointed on this committee.
In the course of an argument on the
registration law as now being enforced, it
was the general opinion that precinct reg
istration would not be legal and a commit
tee consisting of George Francoeur, George
H. Cabanis, ex-Judge Ferrai and Judge
Craig, was appointed to arrange for a test
caÂ«e with the Election Commissioners.
A committee on ratification of the nomi
nations made by the Chicago convention
was appointed with M. J. Zemantky as
chairman.

AT THE PESTHOUSE
The Anti-Leprosy Medicine
Opened and Exam
ined.
IT IS IN THREE FORMS.
But Appetite for a Holiday
Dinner May Delay Treat
ment
LEPERS IN FOUR CLASSES.
Much Interest and Curiosity Displayed
by the Lepers at the
Unpacking.
Five dig boxes ornamented outside and |
ins.de with mystic Japanese characters I
were dumped at the Pesthouse door yester- j
day morning.
They mutely announced the Jong- I
delayed arrival of the Dr. Goto anti- j
leprosy specific for which the fourteen
lepers there have been patiently waiting
for so many days. The course of treat
ment will now soon begin.
City Physician A. P. O'Brien arrived
soon after the medicine did. He and
Superintendent J. P. Keating of the Pest
house, when the boxes had found a final
place of storage in the nurses' room in the
smallpox ward, opened one of the boxes.
Curious and odorless little brown pills
by the bucketful, bushels of small chips of
what seems to be bark of a faint aud pecu
liar odor, and bushels of hail" crushed and
powdered yellow barK, were exposed to I
light for the first time since they left the i
land of the Mikado. The small chips first !
described are to make tea with, and the â¢
other so-called chips are to go into the
baths with the lepers. The Chinese
woman, "Annie," one of the worst cases!
of leprosy In tbe Pesthouse, watched the i
opening of the Lex and inspected the i
three preparations of the cure with great j
interest.
The packages are put up in the neat
Japanese manner. Each package con
tains instructions in Japanese and Eng
lish.
Dr. O'Brien prepared a schedule of doses
to direct the nurses and posted it on the ;
wail. The lepers are all designated by I
name, and the quantity of pills and tea i
and the numberof baths is about the same I
in each. The schedule looks something
like this:
Frank Bindt, 1

tSee O, I fnl. One teaspoou-
I.lm Now, I ful after each meal
Ah I.cc, I three times a day.
Ah Koofc, I
Ab Kow, I
Ah Kin,
Yee Foo. J
There are from 90 to 100 pills in a tea
spoonful. The pills have a tendency to |
nauseate in many cases. Superintendent j
Keating, who sampled one, said they are j
almost tasteless, but he drew the line at |
drinking the tea and taking a bath in the
stuff.
There are about three heaping table
spoonsful of the tea in each package. It
is put into about a pintot water and boiled
down one-third before using.
The package containing tne bath prep
aration is about the size of a bunch 01 fire*
crackers. The bark is put into a linen
bag and soaked in the water. Dr. Goto's
instructions are that pure running water
is best for the bath and well water next
best. The Pesthouse has neither.
The whites and the Chinese will bathe
in separate tubs, and they will use one
water. Owing to the limited accommoda
tions at the lest Louse probably only one
bath a day will be taken.
The Bindt boys, as mentioned in The
Call several days ago, have taken the
treatment before. It did them a great
deal of good. They were broken out, and
their faces and hands were as badly
swollen and as scaly as the worst case in
the Pesthouse. Now their complexions
are clear, though pale, and their flesh is
smooth. They will keep up the treatment.
Pedro Penida, the Mexican, has been tak
ing the pills alone about two months. He
said yesterday that they had done him
some s;ood. When the pills nauseate the
instructions of Dr. Goto are to stop using
them for a day or two, and to nevei take
them on an empty stomach. Further in
structions from Dr. Goto are to the effect
that for every five days of bathing there
must be one day of rest, and that if con
gestion or fatigue follow, the number of
baths must be decreased. The member of
the Board of Health of Honolulu who was
here some weeks ago said that tbe baths,
though the most inconvenient to take,
seemed to do the lepers more good than
any other part of tbe treatment. The
water must cover the shoulders of the
bather.
It was intended to celebrate the glorious
Fourth at the Pesthouse by beginning the
treatment this morning, but the leper
appetite may interfere with this pro
gramme. The leper appetite is quite vig
orous. The fourteen unfortunates heard
yesterday afternoon that Superintendent
Keating is going to give them a special
spread to-day in honor of the Declaration
of Independence. Among ocuer good
things to eat each leper, as be passes be
fore the cook's window bearing a platter
for the regular "hand-out," will be given a
piece of succulent roast pig and some
pastry.
Now, the lepers know that the Dills have
a tendency to make them sick at tbe stom
ach, so some have declared themselves to
the effect that they prefer to postpone the
beginning of the treatment one day to run
ning the ri3k of losing roast pig and pas
try after it is comfortably located under
their waistbands, and this may be done.
Superintendent Keating was inclined to
postpone the treatment till all couKi be
gin it together.
Dr. O'Brien said last evening that if the
roast pig and pastry appetite of the pa
tients did not shrink in size the treatment
might not begin to-day. "They are going
to have a little beer, too, I believe," he
said.
"I have divided the patients into four
(lasses," he continued, "from thoee who
have leprosy in its incipient stages up to
those who have it in its worst form.
There i.Â« only one case of Asiatic leprosy
out thereâ the scaly kind. He is that tall,
tine-looking Chinaman. Each of the four
classes will bathe in the same water. Ido
not want to put those who have the dis
ease in its early stage into tne same water
with the ulcerated patients. I do not
think I shall go out there again until
Monday morning."
"When ought the effect of the treatment
to become visible?" he was asked.
"It ought to be visible in tbe skin of tbe
patients in two or three days," the doctor
replied.
THE VETTER ESTATE.
< oinplieation* Over the Property of n
Mother Who Gave All to Her Son.
There seems to be some friction among
the surviving relatives of Caroline Vetter,
who died last month, leaving a will which
bequeathed her property to her son, Fred
erick J. Vetter. The will was made in
1893, but in 1896, four months before she
died, Mrs. Vetter executed a deed of gift,
conveying what property she had to her
sod. The property consisted of real estate
on Market street, near Sixth, and of a
residence on Fell street.
Since Mrs. Vetter's death Rosine Grant,
a sister of trie deceased, has filed a petition
askine that N, Jacobs be appointed ad
ministrator of tbe estate in question.
Yesterday F. J. Vetter tiled a paper pro
testing against Jacobs' appointment and
declaring that Rosine Grant has no rights
in the matter which need protection.
SIEBE'S BANK SUITS.
L,a Societe Francaise Obtains a Writ of
Certlorarl ia the Matter.
The last bank suit against Assessor
Siebe to prevent him assessing the corpo
ration's personal holdings on the basis of
the Bank Commissioners' report, was filed
yesterday. La Societe Francaise d'Eparg
nes et de Prevoyance Mutuelle is plaintiff
in the case.
The French Bank claims that on April
10 it paid the Assessor the taxes on its
property as valued by that corporation,
and received a receipt in full therefor, but
that since then the Assessor has assessed
other property of the bank, which is not
assessable under the law, amounting in
all to $348,727. The additional tax would
be $7846 36.
Mr. Siebe notified the bank that unless
this amount was paid before noon yester
day he would seize its personal property
to satisfy bis claim. The bank, therefore,
prayed that a writ of certiorari be issued,
in order that the action of the Assessor
micht be reviewed and that Siebe be en
joined from further proceedings in the
matter until after the case had been de
cided.
Judge Troutt granted the restraining
order, and the hearing will be had next
week. >
TO FLY A MILE IN THE AIR
Forecast 0 ficial Will Launch
Kites Under Auspices
of "The Call."
Mr. Hammon Proposes to S?nd Up
Scientific Missionaries From the
Roof of the Mills Building.
In addition to the many attractions
offered the people of San Francisco to-day
will be a novel feature from the roof of the
Mills building occupied by tne Govern
ment Weather Bureau. From this coign
of vantage P'orecast Official W T . H. Ham
mon will make an experiment with several
new modeled kites just received from
Washington, D. C.
These kites have been made expressly
for San Francisco by Mr. Pottor of the
Weather Bureau Department. The model
! upon which they are formed required ad
j ditional strength in consequence of the
I high wind in this City.
Mr. Hammond and his associate, Alex
ander G. McAdie, will send the first kite
into the air from the roof at 9 o'clock this
morning and will continue running the
wire with his experiments until 12 o'clock,
thereby giving the thousands of spectators
who will be out of doors an opportunity
of viewing Mr. Pottor's model at a height
of a mile in an easterly direction from the
top of a ten-story building.
It will be the ambition of Mr. Hammon
this forenoon to surpass anything hereto
fore recorded in the kite-flying line. The
highest elevation made by any Kite is that
recently reported to have been made in
Washington within the past fsw weeks,
j where it is said the 6000 feet limit had
j been passed, but those figures are not
taken as official by the authorities in this
I City. The verified record, however, of
j 4700 feet, as made in New Jersey, is cred
! ited, and to pass this, as also the reported
j Washington figures, will be one of Mr.
I Hamrnon's ambitions to-day.
In breaking this kite-flying record the
experiment will be under tbe auspices of
the San Francisco Call.
An experiment was made yesterday
I afternoon at 4:30 o'clock, when the kite
I was sent out for a half mile, with a wind
â  force of thirty miles an hour. Everything
worked most satisfactorily and the
Weather Bureau officials are confident that
they will achieve the honor of send
l ing a kite higher in the air than has ever
â¢ been done heretofore. At all events the
I trial will be made, and should a success
follow Mr. Hammon will be pleased and
I the people oi San Francisco will be grati
; fied to learn that the attempt has been
i made to penetrate the heavens with m
j struments that will inform them of tbe
! kind of climate that the fellows up there
I have to live in.
C. P. WELCH IS CHOSEN,
An Efficient Man to Be Suc
cessor to the Late General
McComb.
Elected Out of Thirteen Candi
datesâAn Ex-Naval
Officer.
It has been announced by President
Sonntag of the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children that C. P. Welch,
out of thirteen candidates, haa been
chosen the successor of General McComb
as secretary of the society. He was in
dorsed by thirty naval officers, several of
ficers of the regular army, besides by
many of the leading merchants of the
City. Altogether 142 signatures attested
to this gentleman's ability and worth.
Mr. Welch is a naval officer on the re
tired list, being a graduate of the Annapo
lis class of 1868. Among his classmates
are numbered Executive Officer Ingersoll
of the Philadelphia and Executive Officer
Wadams of the Monterey.
Mr. Welch was born in Charlestown,
1 Mass., in 1847, but has lived in California
twenty-two years and has been a resident
of San Francisco for thirteen years.
His friends say that he is particularly
adapted to this position, requiring as It
does executive ability, tact and firmness
in emergencies, as in all these qualifica
tions Mr. Welch is attested to be favored.
The future secretary is a man of gre. t
popularity among his comrades, and has
been an officer in the George H. Thomas
Post. G. A. R., for eight years.
Mr. Welch expressed himself last night
as hiehly gratified at the honor and con
fidence conferred upon him by his friends.
'â¢Wliat is particularly gratifying to me,"
said he, "is that no place where I went
was I refused indorsement. I believe that
1 have a taste for this kind of work, and
shall certainiy exert every effort to up
hold all the principles and requirements of
ihe office."
In 1876 the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children was organized in this
City and so great has its sphere of useful
ness become that it attends regularly to
750 cases each month. The present presi
dent.is Charles Sonntag.

The Way in Which They
Purpose to Dispose
of It.
AN INCREASED REVENUE
Several New Sources Which
Have Been Created Since
the War.
A TOBACCO LEAF MONOPOLY.
Secretary Hayakawa Talks of His
Country's Great Strides This
Coming Year.
S. Hayakawa, private secretary of the
Minister of Finance of Japan and Govern
ment Inspector cf the Bank of Japan, is
among the distinguished foreign guests
S. Hayakawa. Private Secretary of the Minister of Finance of Japan.
now staying at the Palace. Next month
he will be in London directing the dis
bursement of the $100,000,000 now on de
posit in the BanK of England by China to
the credit of Japan. He intends to remain
there a year and will then return to his
financial departmental duties of state in
Tokio. The $75,000,000 balance of the war
indemnity due from China to Japan is
payable in six installments in the month
of May of the next succeeding years, but
in addition to this sum there are the inter
est upon the principal, the annual 500,000
taels for the expenses of the Japanese
troops while they remain at Wai-hai-wei
and the 30,000,000 taels allowed for the
surrender of the peninsula of Liau-Tong,
the payments of which have to be seen to
by the accredited representatives of the
two Governments.
"The national debt of Japan," said ths
Secretary, "is now about 370,000,000 yen,
bearing interest, generally, at 5 per cent
per annum. The expenses of the late war
with China were some 210,000,000 yen and j
the result will bs an enormous increase in
the expenditures of the state. Before the
war our finances were conducted on a very
uniform scale, but now, since its cessation, |
all is changed, and Viscount Watanabe is
compelled to adopt a new and broader pol
icy to meet the requirements of existing
conditions.
"The damage to our army and navy
must be repaired immediately, and a vast
sum of money must also be appropriated j
to the encouragement of our home indus- I
tries and manufactures and to foreign trade I
and commerce. To carry out these ideas i
successfully the first step" necessary was to
devise ways and means for increasing our
national revenue. For the accomplish
ment of this purpose we have taken the
following measures:
"1. A monopoly has been declared upon
tobacco leaves.
'â¢2. The tax upon Bake has been in
creased 30 per cent.
"3. A stamp tax has been levied upon the
record of all sales and transfers of real
estate, etc.
"4 A uniform license tax is exacted from
leading business and professional men.
"All tobacco- planters have to send their
leaves to the Government warehouses,
whence the raw material ia supplied to
manufacturers, sake, or rice wine, is in
common use in our country, and the reve
nue derived from this source is corre
spondingly large. The tax on real estate
transactions, etc., is regulated according
to values, and in the business and pro
fessional licenses it is only the wealthier
people who are taxed. With these new I
sources the Government secures a net in- i
crease of 28,000,000 yen a year over that of '
preceding years.
"For all this money, not to mention the
war indemnity, Japan has many uses.
The interest on Government bonds must
be met, also the increased pension claims, j
The army and navy must be put in a \
condition which will insure the safety of
the nation, railroads, telegraph and tele- I
phone lines must be constructed, embank- j
ments must be built along our rivers to
prevent inundation^ iron factories must
be erected, a new banking system must be
established to loan money on real estate,
subsidies must be granted to navigation
companies, harbors must be constructed,
our civil and military system of education
must be improved, the lately acquired
island of Formosa must be settled, etc.
"In our estimated expenses for the
present fiscal year we allow 400,000,000 yen
for the construction of railroads; for the
principal and interest on Government
bonds, 30,000,000 yen ; foi the army. 42,000,
-000 yen; for the navy, 24,000,000 yen; for
pensions, 3,000,000 yen ; for telegraph and
telephone lines, 3,000,000 yen ; for naviga
tion subsidies, ships, etc., 700,000 yen; for
the establishment of iron factories, 600,000
yen ; for public education, 500,000 yen."

Nobles of the Ancient Arabic Order of
the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine, with
their wives and daughters, got away at
6:30 o'clock last evening on their excur
sion to Alaska. They will leave the oasis
of California for about twenty-six days,
a weefc or ten days of which will be spent

flowers of the far north. There is much
night and many glaciers in Alaska, but
the climate on the coast is mild.
The party took the train forTacoma and
will board the steamer Queen at that
point. Captain Carroll of the Queen is an
old San Francisco boy, and members of
the party have in store for him a thing or
two in the nature of surprises.
The Queen's cabins will be decorated
with emblems of the Mystic Shrine. There
will be a sine excursion to Juneau after
the party reaches Sitka. Colonel V. R.
Duboce, secretary of the Shrine, who has
assisted materially in the preparations,

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
Captain- Douglassâ M. 8., City. William Y.
Douglass, retired captain of police, is a native
of the city of New York.
The Swokd of Bunker Hillâ S. E. C. City.
The words of "The Sword of Bunker Hill" were
published in The Call October 7, 1894.
Naturalizationâ A. G., City. Any of ths
departments of the Superior Court of this City
and County, when in session, will receive ap
plications for naturalization. No special days
have been set for the departments for that
purpose.
McKim-ey's Religionâ Lady Subscriber, City.
William McKinley, the Republican candidate
for President of the United States, is a member
of the Mi-thcKlist church. On the first page of
Thk Call, issue of Monday. June 22, you will
find an account of Major McKiuley at worship.
February 29â T. H. H., City. An individual
born on the 29th of February will not be able
to celebrate the anniversary of his birth on
thm day in 1900, for the reason that that year
will not be a leap year, and It is only in leap
years that the 29th of February occurs.
Bonn to Oneâ J. P. J. and others. City.
An answer to a mimber of correspondents
given in the issue of Monday, June 29, under
the head of "The Silver question" in Answers
to Correspondents gives an explanation of the
matter referred to in your communication.
Cesar and Ciceroâ a. C. R., Burlingame.
Cal. There is considerable difference of opin
ion*as to how these two words should be pro
nounced In Latin. The pronunciation as
taught in the schools or San Francisco at this
time is, as if Caspar whs written keesar, and
Cicero was written kickero.
Cuban Revoltjttonâ j. w., East Oakland, Cal.
It is no easy matter to communicate by letter
with the revolutionists in Cuba. Probably the
most successful way to accomplish that would
be to write to tne Cuban Junta, New York
City, inclosing the communication which it is
desired should be transmitted.
Answersâ M. 8., City. No charge is made
for ansv-ers in this department. All questions
to which it is possible to obtain an answer
will receive attention and recognition; but
there are questions asked sometimes that it is
impossible to answer, and this department
does not feel called on to give a reason in each
cs?e why no answer is given.
For the Presidencyâ J. w., Usal, Mendocino
County, Cal. The constitution of the United
States says: "No person except a natural
born citizen, or a citizen of the United States
at the time of the adoption of thit constitu
tion, shall be eligible to the office of President;
neither shull any person bo eligible to that
oflice who shall not have attained the ace of
35 years and been fourteen years a resident
within the United States."
Electing a Popeâ A. C. R.. Burlingame, Cal.
The election of a Pope was definitely placed in
the hands of the Cardinals by Pope Nicholas
11. in 1059, and, with some modifications, this
is the present method of election. The Cardi
nals meet on the eleventh day after the de
cease of the Pope in n series of double cells
(conclave) one for each Cardinal, his secretary
and chamberlain, and on the lollowing day
the election begins. They are not bound to
elect a Cardinalâ only heretics and simoniacal
persons are excludedâ arid the closing act of
the election takes place in a chapel specially
reserved for that purpose.
The Pony Expressâ J. O'D., City. The Pony
Express was established in April, 1860, and
was part of the mail service between San Fran
cisco and New York, by way of Sacramento
and St. Joseph, Mo. The distance between the
points named was traversed by horsemen who
each had 10 cover a stretch of sixty miles and !
who were pttid high wages. The packages
they curried did not exceed ten pounds, and
the charge for transportation was !Â£5 gold per
quarter 011 uce. The delivery from Now York
to San Francisco was made in fourteen days.
The express continued in operation two years,
and was withdrawn when the telegraph across
he continent was completed
Homesteadâ X., Vacaville, CaL A person
may declare a homestead on his dwelling and
the land on which it stands, and the limit of
the homestead at the time of declaration must
not exceed $5000. The amount of land does
not affect the declaration. The market value
is generally considered the test of the value of
the homestead.
The Bet Was Offâ Sport, City. In the Cor*
bett-Sharkey match the decision of the referee
declaring bets off affects all bets, those made
outside as well as those made inside of the
poolroom, for the reason that the proposition
that Sharkey was to stay four rounds with cor
bett was not determined. Before the termina
tion of the fourth round the police stepped in
and put an end to the show, consequently
Sharkey did not demonstrate that he could
stay four rounds with his opponent. Bets
made on that proposition are off
Corbett and Choynskiâ a. S., City. The
record shows that in 1884 Jim Corbett met
Choynski and defeated him in one round.
They met again May 30, 1889, at Fairtax and
fought four rounds, wlien the police put a
stop to the fight. On the sth of June follow
ing they again met, that time at Benicia,
when they fought twenty-seven rounds and
Choynski was the loser, he being knocked out.
On the 15th ot July, same year, they met once
more, that time inVan Kran<isco, and Choyn
ski was defeated in four rounds.
Swimmingâ J. W. C, City. The best way to
learn to swim is to place yourself under the
care of a swimming teacher, but if you do not
care to do that the following is said by a pro
fessor of natation to be the best method for one
who wishes to learn. "Wade out until breast
deep in the water, tnrn toward the shore,
throw a white pebble or other object easily
discernible a short distance before you and
pluuge after It. The resistance offered by the
water to this effort will buoy you up and the
moment you have acquired sufficient confi
dence and command of your limbs to strike
out regularly you will have learned to swim."
To Obtain a Patentâ T. McD., City. In order
to obtain a patent it is always safest to con
sult a reputable attorney who makes a spe
cialty of such business. You might on your
own account make application for a patent at
the Patent Office in Washington, but you
might make a mistake that would involve con
siderable loss to you. The fees, exclusive of
that charged by the attorney for his service,
are to be paid in advance aud are as follows:
On Sling each original application for a patent,
$15 : on issuing each original patent, $20. In
design cases â For three years and six months,
$10; for seven years, $15; for fourteen years,
$30. On filing each caveat, $10; on every ap
plication for the reissue of a patent, $30; on
filing each disclaimer, $10; for certified copies
of patents and other uapers in manuscript, 10
cents per 100 words; for certified copies of
printed patent 3, 85 cents; for uncertified
copies of printed patents, 10 cents; for record
ing every assignment, agreement, power of at
torney or other paper of 300 words or under,
$1; of over 300 and under 1000 words, $2;
oi over 1000 words. $3 ; for copies of drawings,
the reasonable cost of making them.
Etiquetteâ D. J., City. If A and B, strangers
to each other, call upon Mrs. C. and after the
evening has advanced A finds It is time to re
tire he should do so quietly, express his regrets
to the hostess and to B that he is forced to
"leave such pleasant company," etc., and as
he leaves B should rise and either extend his
hand or bow and express regret that A must
take bis leave. If a hostess has a servant she
should call that individual to aceomuany a
parting guest to the door, it there arc other
guests in the parlor, as it is improper to allow
a parting guest to make his or her way out the
best way possible. If the hostess has no ser
vant she can excuse herself to those remaining
and herself accompany the parting guest. If
you are invited by a friend to dive at one of
the large hotels the friend will order the din
ner, but as a rule if the diunerisa la carte the
friend will consult your tasies as to the partic
ular dishes you may desire to have brought to
you, ana such should only be ordered as each
course comes in order. It would be very im
polite on accepting a friend's invitation lo
dine to examine the bill of fare aud tneu say,
"I guess I'll have ciiieken soup, crab salad,
oyster patties, fricandeau and peas some roast
Chicken, asparagus and French salad, char
lotte rut-so, ictcream and small cakes, aud then
a small cup of coffee." No, it will nev;-r do
under the circumstances "to order all the
courses at the same time." If a lady is seated
in a parlor and a stranger enters and is in
troduced the lady, unless an invalid or of ad
vanced age, should rise while acknowledging
the introduction.
Jury Dutyâ "Wellington," City. The law of
this State says that every citizen of 21 years of
age who has been a resident of the one
year and of the county or city and county
ninety days, who has the possession of all bis
faculties, has ordinary intelligence and is not

MALARIA AND RHEUMATISM
From the Journal, Wilmington, Ohio.
On one of the fertile farms of the rich Ohio
Valley, seven miles from Wilmington, the
county scut of Clinton County, Ohio, and but a
short distance from the small town of Melvin,
their postoffice, in a cozy little country home,
resides John Arrasmith and his wile, Minnie.
A few days since a representative of the
Journal drove out to Melvin to see them. In
the course of the conversation, Mrs. A. detailed
the facts of her cure:
"Last July," said she, "from undue exposure
in mv work about the farm, I contracted ma
larial fever and rheumatism and suffered from
the illness greatly. I could not throw it off,
and although constantly attended by local
physicians continued to grow worse. In Sep
tember I caught a severe cold, which greatly
increased my other troubles, and taking to my
bed there I lay for months. The rheumatism
grew more aggravated, and for eight long weeks
prior to last Christmas I was perfectly help
less, my limbs below the hips being as if para
lyzed and I having no use of them whatever.
I could not help myself in any way, and was
not able even to turn over in bed unless my
husband or some one else came and turned
me. Medicines which the physicians lcf k ,
did no good and nothing I could take
afforded any relief. I was discouraged ana
feared that never again would I be up and
about the house. It was anything out a
bright prospect, for I was but '20 years old, had
beÂ«sn married only two years and my life was
before me and to go through it a helpless
cripple, a burden to my f. ends, was a fearJul
fute to think of.
"I had read in the Wilmington Journal from
time to lime articles telling of the wonderful
cures which had been effected by Dr. Williams'
Pink Pills, and had become impressed with
the CRses where they had caused persons to
walk and recover who had been us helpless as I
was. Consulting my husband, we determined
to give them a trial. So he drove into
Wilmington, and going to the drug store
of George W. Brown bought three boxes
of the pill?. I began taking them
immediately on his return. That was
about the first of the present year. Before the
first box was gone I began to realize that I was
getting better, and by the time I finished the
second box the pain with which I had been
suffering for nearly six months and the dis
ease which had made me helpless for eight
weeks disappeared entirely aud I got up. I
took the third box of the pills and have never
felt a twinge of rheumatism since, and I am
doing my daily work and feeling as well as
anybody."
To confirm the story Mrs. Arrasmith made
the following affidavit :
Sworn to before me and subscribed in my
presence, at Wilmington, Ohio, this 29th day
of June, 18!). i.
C. Q. Hildebrant, Clerk of Court.
Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People are
now given to the public as an unfailing blood
builder and nerve restorer, curing all iorrns of
weakness arising from a watery condition of
the blood or shattered nerves. The pills are
sold by all dealer*, or will be sent post paid on
receipt of price (50 cents a box, or six boxes
for $2 50â they are never sold in hulk or by
the 100) by addressing Dr. Williams' Medicine
Company, Schenoctady, N. Y.

THE FIELD OF SPORT.
What the Oarsmen, Athletes and
Cyclists Are Doing.
In wheeling the great event of the sea
son will be brought off to-day at Peta
iuma. As will be seen by reference to the
cycling columns thousands of people are
expected to be present to witness the
great racing events, and, as *Â»n exceedinK
ly warm day is promised, all lovers of
lemonade will bfc in tho swim.
The pastimes of to-day consist of base
ball at the Presidio and Folsom-street
grounds, coursing at Ocean View, Pacific
Inanimate Target Association shooting
contests at Alameda Point, cricket at Ala
meda, lawn tennis tournament at San
Rafael, handball in the professional Dall
courts and yachting on the bay.
THE WHEELMEN.
Annual Division Meet of the League
at Petaiuma To- Day.
The annual meet of the North Califor
nia Division of the League of American
Wheelmen will be held to-day and to
morrow at Petaiuma, and wheelmen from
all over the State have assembled at that
point to join ih the celebration. A ball,
parade, races, country run and barbecue
are some of the features of the meet, to
all of which league members are given
free admission. Of these features proba
bly the most interest attaches to the races,
which will be held on the Petaiuma
Wheelmen's new four-lap track, which
has already earned a reputation lor speed
and safety. The best riders in the State
are entered in the different events, and
the contests should be close and exciting.
The handicapping has been done by Rob
ert Assheton Smyth, official handicapper
of the league, in his usual impartial
manner.
All tbe big local clubs will attend the
meet. A great many of the men went up
last night on the 5:10 o'clock Tiburon boat
and train. The big party was that ar
ranged oy the Bay City Wheelmen and
managed by Acting Captain George E.
Dixon. They chartered the steamer Gol i,.
which left Jackson-street wharf at 5:30
o'clock, laden down with Bay Wheelmen,
San Francisco Road Club members,
Olympic Cyclers, bicycles, music and
lunch, and they were having a most jolly
time as they left the wharf. The steamer
makes the run in about five or six hours.
They will remain until Sunday and return
tlir.t afternoon by v:heel.
Those wl<o did not iro to Petaiuma yes
terday will have to take the early boat this
mo' nine, wh icli lenves the Tiburon slip at
7:30 o'clock, to reach there in time for all
the festivities. To accomodate those who
desire to return to this City to-night a spe
cial train will leave Potaiuma at 9p. m.,
reaching here in about two hours.
The r'etaluma wheelmen have com
pleted ail arrangements ior the big meet,
and it promises to be the best affair of the
Kind ev<r held on the coast. Tbe support
tliey have received irom the city clubs has
given them confidence right along, for
they knew that if ail the San Francisco
clubs attended the meet, that alone would
make it a success, and Petaiuma itself,
always loyal to the home cluo, will turn
out all her citizens to help crowd the
grounds and cheer the winners of the
races.
The cycling writers of the San Francisco
papers are curious to see the Petaiuma
track's press stand, and they will have the
opportunity to-day. One of the riders
who is there training writes me to De
sure and come up Saturday, and closes his
letter in the following slangy but expres
sive way, "You we ntn t be a thins but glad
when you see the press stand here; it's a
peach."
The league meet over, the wheelmen's
attention will next be directed to the
twenty-mile road race of the California
Associated Cycling Clubs, which takes
place Sunday, July 12, over the San Lean
dro triangle. The entries close next Tues
day night. There are to be teams of five
men from *>ach club. The Garden Citj
Cyclers and Bay City Wheelmen will not
enter the race, and it will probably be won
by the Acme Club Wheelmen of Oakland,
as the rules of the race provide that the
riders must be pure amateurs, not even
class B men of last year whom the league
has restored to amateurism, and the Acme
Club has the most and best men on the
coast, when the line is drawn so fine.
The Imperial Cycling Club go^s to Peta
iuma this morning by the 7:30 boat, to
take part in the big cycle parade there.
The club also has a number of good riders
entered in the races. In the postal notice
to members the secretary adds the follow
ing:
This is the annual L. A. W. meet and L. A.
W. members will be admitted to the races free
on presentation of membership ticKet. At
Petaiuma we will dine at tbe L. A. W. hotel,
and your membership card will entitle you to
a reduction. It is to your interest and also to
that of the club to join the L. A. W. ; the an
nual election is near at band and our club
should be represent'--! on the new board. The
initiation free is $1 and the annual dues $l,
whici) is a very trivial expense considering
the many advantages derived.
The regular m-eting of the Imperials
will be held next Monday evening. The
initiation Jee to the club is now ?5. An
Imperial club paper called the Announcer
has been started by Edwards <fe Macary,
members of the club. The first number
will appear July 15. It will be devoted
largely to Imperial Club items in addition
to general cycling news.
Colonel Albert A. Pope, president, and
A. E. Pattison, secretary of the Pope
Manufacturing Company, sailed for En
rope July 1, and will be absent several
months.
The Pacific Cycling Club will have a run
to Boulder Creek during the Fourth of
July holidays. The start will be made
this morning at 4 o'clock and they will
stop to-night at Congress Springs. To
morrow they will ride to Boulder Creek
and return by train in the afternoon.
There are two Masonic cycling clubs in
the United States; one is the Orion Cycle
Clnb of Brooklyn, N. V. ; the other is the
Lv Lv Wheelmen of Philadelphia, com
posed of the Mystic Shrine, which was or
ganized in August, 1891, and for a long
time had tlie honor of being the only
league club in the city.
Charles A. Eliiot, one of the charter
members of the Bay City Wheelmen, was
married recently u> Miss Smith of Stock
ton and is now receiving tbe congratula
tions of his friends and fellow members.
In those good old cycling days when a
rider (we all rode ordinaries then) knew
peisonally every other rider in the City
and the make of his wheel (there were
only two or three different styles), Elliot
was one of the most enthusiastic riders
ami took many lone country trips in com- ]
l>any with Steve Knapp, Billy Meeker. I
Ralph Thompson, Billy McClure, Fred
Allan, Porter Libby, Robert M. Welch,
Frank Jnme*, the writer and others, some i
of whose names you seldom hear of in I
cycling affairs nowadays.
The California Cycling Club is going to
bid for the prizes offered in the parade at
Petaiuma to-day; and Lieutenant Reid, in
the absence of Captain Mayo, will take up
a large number of the members on the
early train. At the regular meeting next
Monday night the prizes won in the club's i
recent road race will be distributed.
There is almost as much rivalry between ,
Ziegler and Cooper upon the National I
circuit as between Cooper and Bald. At!
New Orleans on June 13 Ziegler broke the j
world's record for a lialf mile in competi- ;
tion, winning the race in 1:00 4-5. Nothing â¢
would do but Cooper must have that
record, and he saved his best efforts for
half-mile event*. He did not ! aye to wait
long, for at Utica, N. V., on the 17th he '
found a fast track and speedy competitors,
and to win the race he had to ride it in
record time, :59 3-6. Its Ziegler's turn
now.
Edwin E. Stoddard of the Bay City
Wheelmen will start in a few days on a
business trip to Mexico, and will be gone
about three months. Ho will take his
wheel with him. and may do some riding.

The annual picnic run of the California
Associated Cycling clubs will be held on
Sunday, July 19, at Coyote Point Beach,
: near San Mateo. The . run will start
| from Twenty-second and Folsom streets
iat 9 o'clock a. m. Lunch is to be furnished
by each of the clubs attending, and will be
carted to the grounds free by the associa
tion. There is a fine grove of trees on the
picnic grounds, and an elegant bathhouse
near by, and the prospects of a salt water
swim after the ride will tempt many on
the rnn. A large crowd is expected.
Santord Plummer, official referee for
this district, has been ill for a week past
and may not be well enousrh to officiate at
the races at Petaiuma to-day. If not Mr.
Welch of the racing board will take charge.
There is no choice between the two gentle
men as referees; both are equally good.
Ray Macdonaid, who came here with
the Columbia team early in 18M5 as a team
mate ot E.idie Bald, but could not ride
owing to ill health, made many warm
friends during his visit to this coast. It
will be a great surprise to them to learn
that Macdonaid was married on February
5 last to Miss Marion E. Nichols of New
York. The wedding has just been an
nounced in New York and has surprised
his friends there mightily. The news was
conveyed to me in a personal letter to a
friend. Macdonaid has been on the Conti
nent during the past two months, racing
with the foreign professionals, and has
been remarkably successful. He is now on
his wav home, and will compete during
the rest of the season on the National cir
cuit.
The members of the. Golden Gate Cy
cling Club enjoyed a splenaid run to Mair
field iast Sunday. Tuesday evening the
officers tendered the members an informal
reception and banquet after the usual
weekiy business meeting. The clnb is
adding to its roll every week. George
Haie and H. Sadke were admitted at tue
last meeting. The five-mile road race of
the club will be held in a few weeks, and
tbe men are now training for the event.
Thus far Captain J. Black has shown the
most speed, and bids fair to become a very
fast rider with proper training. There
will be about twenty-five entrants in the
road race.
Riders possessing a due regard for the
rights and privileges of pedestrians never
clang their bells unnecessarily. It is suf
ficient for the careful, observing cyclist to
give timely warning only, not to ring his
alarm after the occasion has passed, or in
a hysterical manner when it is too late.
The wheeling critics of the larger cities
can best i omprehend t'.is statement.
Take New York for instance. Green cy
clist run down pedestrians almost daily
there, and in nine cases out of ten it de
velops that the rider rang too late, forgot
to do it, or did it when too far away for
his victim to note the warning. Common
sense will dictate when to ling and when
not to ring.
Coasting on bicycles promises to grow in
popularity everywhere as a means oi diver
sion. Club contests are now all the rage
in the Empire State, prizes beine offered
as in a race. The fat man has~a chance
with his lean friend in this sort ot a con
teat, which accounts in part for its measure
of success. It is often the case that a
coasting competition forms the feature of
a club run. A long hiil is chosen, the
straighter the better, and the entrant that
goes the furthest witnout removing his
feet from the coasters or sculling (moving
the forward wheel to the right and left) '
wins first prize. Probably the biggest
coasting event ever held will be that now
being promoted by the Metropolitan As
sociation of Cycling Clubs of New York
City. It will take place August 15 on one
of the hills on the Irvington-Milburn
course in Jersey, made lamoua by the
great handicap held there annually on
Decoration day.
When the associated tlubs* gave their
ten-mile road race last October, and there
were ninety-six entrants from the twenty
three different clubs belonging to the asso
ciation, every one remarked about the big
entry list; and it was big, and considerable
difficulty was found in correctly placing
the men and computing the times at the
finish. Under these circumstances the
news that the South Side Cycling Club of j
Chicago is to hold an open road-race to
day for which there are over 500 entries is
rather astonishing. And the clubs and
papers don't seem to think much of it
either. The race is to be held over the
famous course to Pullman. I wonder how
Mr. Wetmore or Captain Strong would
like to take the times of snch a race as
that, and how Charley Adams or Judge
Kerrigan would enjoy officiating as judges.
It must require about a hundred scorers.
A number of members of the San Fran
cisco Road Club went to Petaiuma last
night, and tho balance will follow this
morning, taking tbe 7:30 Tiburon boat.
The San Franciscos will stand a good
chance of winning a prize in the cycle
parade there.

THE ANCLER.
Sportsmen Who Have LwftThls City
for the Trout Streams.
Carey Friedlander. Alexander Hamil
ton, president of the Country Club, and a
a party of sportsmen left this City last
evening for Boca. The expert flycasters
will whip the Truckee River to-day and
to-morrow, and as they are well supplied
with Henry Skinner's best killing trout
flies, it is presumed that they will land in
this City Monday morning with baskets
well filled with beautiful rainbows.
John H. Grindley and wife are rusticat
ing at Independence Lake. Mr. Grindley
is, without auestion, one of the most ex
pert lake fishermen on earth, and as Jack
Sarami has "posted" him on the ways and
means of catching cut-throat trout, the ex
press company wili doubtless nave its
bands full delivering packages of fish in
this City to many friends of the "flowery"
Grindley.
Alexander McCord. John Lemmer, John
Berires and a friend who pretends to be a
fly-caster, visited San Andreas Lake last
Thursday. Fishing was first class and the
anglers had very little difficulty in filling
Uieir baskets with steelheads. Mr. Mc-
Cord, who got enthusiastic over the sport
of fly-castinp, has left an order with a
prominent rod-maker fora first-class rod
for fly-casting. Sufficient to say that Mr
McCord "with his black gnat flies" dis
counted a gentleman of the party who
boasted of being the only member who
could cast a fly properly.
W. P. Fuller. Fran* Fuller, George
Stratton and Jack McGlynn left last even

The party will camp at Gravely Valley,
which is a good game and fishing section,
near the south fork of ibe Eel River, in
Mendocino County.
Dr McKenzie and family and Mrs.
Timothy Hopkins left this City last
Wednesday for Soda Springs, where good
trout fishing is now to be had.
H. Battu and a friend had a very excel
lent day's trout fishing on Alameda Creek
near the confluence of the Calaveras
Creek iast Sunday. Mr. Battu had two
fish among those caught that scaled one
and one and a half pounds respectively.
Captain Goorge dimming recently left
this City for s ime black bass fishing in the
Russian River near Duncan's Mills. The
Captain will leave this City for Lake In
dependence when he returns from the bass
waters. Charley Green will visit the Rus
sian River to-day.
Ed Bosqui has jnst returned from
Eureka, Humboldt County. He states
that the net fishermen are now catching
laree quantities of young steelbeads near
the mouth of Eel River.
Edward Kolb, the all-round sportsman
and athlete, left here last Wednesday with
General Dickinson for an outing north of
Ckiah. The sportsmen will camp in the
vicinity of John Day's resort, at the head

thority for the statement that wild Bheep
with antlers are very plentiful in the
vicinity oi the camping ground.
L. Miller ana Edward Siiadd basketed a
very nice let of trout last Sunday. They
fished the Lagunitas Creek at night and
report that the large nsh cannot be taken
after sunrise.
The Fly-casting Club will hold its next
meeting at Stow* Lake on t!he afternoon
of the 11th inst.
Last Sunday the following anglers en
joyed a most successful outing on San
Andreas Lake: P. Quinlan and party, W.
Whelan. Al Smith, H. P. Terry, Bob Tay
lor. J. Butler, C. Prerht, J. Mevers and E.
J. Bate*. It is thought that there will be
at least fifty rods on the lake to-morrow.
In a'few weeks tbe trout will grow wise
and wary and will not act as foolish as they
do now. Experience teaches even trout.
The following interesting article on
salmon and salmon-fishing was published
in an Eastern exchange. The writer says:
The question of the fish taking the fly as
food does not (as it sterns to me to be correct)
enter into the problem. In trying to learn
whether the salmon partakes of food after
It enters fresh water I have examined the
digestive organs of about filty salmon
without finding anything whatever in
them. Two views have been well set forth
by Mr. Hallock in his Salmon Fisher, and
by J. Parker Whitney, and a short recital
may not be amiss. Mr. Hallock says:
"The sole purpose of me 'spring run' of the
salmon in entering the rivers is for the object
of feeding. Barb fishing was the primitive
method of killing salmon." About the use of
the fly Mr. Hallock regardÃ it as an affectation
which had its origin among gentlemen sports
men who deemci it as more consistent with
higher ideas of sport than baited hooks. The
first anglers on this side for salmon were
British officers who affected only high art in
killing the salmon. As the salmon is alleged
to have the power to disgorge food from the
stomach Mr. Halloct thinks this is the reas n
why no food is found after the first has been
killed.
Mr. Whitr.ey says that the salmon upon en
tering fresh writer ceases to partake of food,
and the gullet, stomach and digestive organs
shrink or diminish so that it is evident they
are not employed to discharge their normal
functions; in the intervals between its en
trance into fresh water and return to salt
water the saimon is sustained by the enormous
amouut of fat which is stored in its body.
These views, so briefly summarized, are There
suit of much patient labor and investigation.
Yet, a gentleman on the Newfoundland const
told me that he had seen a mouse which must
have been swallowed while swimming taken
out of a salmon's stomnch, and the story was
credibly verified, and theÂ«e instances can be
multiplied. I believe, however, that the in
stances omy exist where the fish has swallowed
the food in saltwater. It is certain tl.at the
salmon will take the fly on tne ;entn or fif
teenth cast, sometimes more, and how can this
be reconciled with the food theory?
1 have seen the salmon lie in the pools, and
have failed to rise them after untiring exer
tions and almost endless patience. I iiave
noted where the salmon were lying, cast five
or six times, changed the uy, repeated my cast
ing, waited a quarter or naif on hour, i ast" Â» gain, j
changed to tne first fly, and finally got that
salmon after three hours' work. It is fairly
Rgre^d that if the salmon rises, and misses the
fly or is not stabbed by the fisherman, it is im
possible to get that fish to rise without a
change of flies. And. again, anglers are united
in saying that after you rise the salmon you
should at once stop casting, reel ln your line,
and a. low the fish at least the time it takes to
smoke your pipe, freshly filled and deliber
ately smoked, or a Havana cigftr, or If, like
me â unfortunate oneâ you have never learned
to appreciate tobacco, then let at least ten
minutes pass into nothingness before you
make another caÂ«t.
AMATEUR ATHLETICS.
What Captain GUI Has to Say Con
cerning the Olympics at Portland.
Leonard Gill, the captain of the Olym
pic Club team, which recently returned
from Poitland, Or., has addressed the fol
lowing letter to ThÂ» Call, giving a de
scriptive account of the races, together
with some oertinent statements as to the
treatment his team received from the offi
cers of the Multnoirah Athletic Club.
Gill speaks the truth when he states
that the Olympic Club should give clooer
attention to outdoor athleiics and better
encouragement to its athletes. Some few
years ago the Olympic colors were always
in the lead at field day meetings. The
Stanford and Berkeley University ath
letes were then satisfied to play a eood
second fiddle to the athletes of the famous
Western athletic club. But time has
wrought many changes in the aihlet'c
way, and now the Olympic Club must be
satisfied to play third fiddle to Stanford
j and Berkeley.
The question now propounded by the
loveis of athletic sport is when will the
Olympic Club awake from its slumbers
and make itself felt, athletically, among
the great clubs that are springing up,
mushroom-like, ail over the land?
Gills' letter:
The trip of the Olympic Club athletes to
Portland, Or., demonstrated one thing, and
that is tne Pacific Northwest is further ad
vanced in out-door athletics than it has been
given credit for.
The Olympics met the Multnomah athlete*
on trar-K and field on Saturday, June 27 in
thirteen events, and were defeated by the
score of 57 to 44, five points going to a firft
and three points to a second.
A great deal has been said in regard to the
treatment of the Olympians, and a few words
at the present time pubiisded in The Call's
sporting department would not be amiss.
The grounds of the Muitonamahs are situated
within ten minutes' walk from the business
heart of the city oi Portland, and are some
what lerger tiian the Olympic Club grounds,
and are much better situated for athletic
sports than the home grounds. The
track is five and a half laps to the mile
with ft 100-yard straight-away along the Â«ide.
The grandstand accommodates about 1500
people, which was flliert to overflowing on the
date of the Olyrnpic-Muitomah games, and it
was the most enthusiastic one the writer ever
saw. The day was everthing that could have
been di-sired, warm and pleasant, with not a
breath of air stirring. The first event on the
programme was called at promptly 3 p. m., the
time advertised, and it found Kerrigan, the
Northwest crackerjack, and Patterson, the
pride of the Olympic club, pitted against each
other. The jumping place was directly in
front of the grandstand, with no fence in* be
tween, which gave the spectators an unob
structed view of the field sports. Owing to
the importance of the different events, but one
was put on at a time.
The bar was speedily raised to the 6-foot
mark, which both men cleared without a fault
âwonderful jumplnc. When the bRr wag
placed *t6 foot 2 inches, Patterson leadine i>ff
knocked it down with his shoulder the crowd
in the stand showing its approval of the same
by lond cheering. Kerrigan then tried it, with
the same result. This made honors even
Patterson attain led off,, with the same result
In justice to Patterson, it must be said, that
two days before the games he re-injured his
jumping foot, which et this stage of tne u<une
was causing him considerable troub.e. Kerri
gan walked about rifteen yards from the bar
ran nimbly at it and cleared it in the most
graceful manner, though he had nothing to
6 pa re.
The audience about this time was very jubi
lant, as Patterson had but one more trial, and
in his last two attempts had not jumped up to
his form.
When the Olympic lad walked back to make
his final attempt the cat-calls that he was
greeted with must have made the better ele
ment feel sorry for some of their representa
tives; but Patterson was more than t'qual to
the occasion and with a mighty bound he
cleared the bar at 6 feet 2 inches, thus tying
Kerrigan.
They both failed at six foot three, and Pat
terson, owing to his ankle getting worse, re
fused to jump the tie-off, with the result that
OFFICERS OF THE PETALUMA WHEELMEN.
Kerrigan was awarded first honors, after clear
ing six ieet. and Patterson second place. Both
of these men are wonders, but Kerrigan has a
better knowledge of jumping than Patterson,
and in the estimation of several critics who
were on Hand Patterson had the better chance
to improve, as hi* style is altogether faulty in
many respects. Kerrigan seems to tie a more
persistent man than Patterson, and as it is his
ambition to set a new world's mark some day,
It is quiie probable that he will soon beuer his
recent performance. Kerrigan is about five
feet five inches in height, and weighs about
I'JO pounds stripped. He is a quiet, gentle
manly fellow, not ti yen to boasting, and as he
is but 18 years old, he will bear close watching.
The next event was the 100-yards dash, and
it found Fuller and Rosenberg of the Mult
nomahs and Butz and Giil of tne Olympic Club
lined up against each other.
The starter, Mr. Rah y, kept the men twice
on the mark for an unnecessary length of time,
with the result thnt Butz and Gill, who were
not used to that sort of starting, became some
what rattled. The third time the men were
put on the mark the starter shot the sprinters
off before the Olympic men had time to think,
with the result that at fifty yards Fuller and
Rosenberg were some yards in the lead, and
the former won out, with Butz second and
Gill third. Ido not wish it understood, mark
you, that Mr. Raley intentionally gave Butz
and Gill the worst of the send-ofl", but the fact
remains patent that they both got the worst of
the pistol.
Butz has always had the reputation of being
an exceptionally fast man in getting away
from the mark, but both of his opponents beat
him handily, because of the starter's style of
starting, which was foreign to them.
Very little can be saia about the broad jump,
Kerrigan winning the same with a jump of 20
feet 11 inches, Brunton coming next with a
jump of 20 feet 51,'5 I ,' inches.
The pole vault the Olympics let go by de
fault, the Multnomahs thus gaining first and
second places without any competition. The
mile run brought out Dave Brown, the best
miler ever seen in these parts, and Tallaut the
best man at that distance ever seen in the
Northwest. This man Tallant is a wonder, and
could, if properly trained, give any man in the
world a pumping race.
Originally TallÂ»nt was a 100-yard man, hav
ing a record for that distance of :10)^. Brown
ran the race of his life against Tailant; he
showed good headwork, plenty of stamina and
courage, but he met, on ihis occasion, his mas
ter. They ran even for the entire distance to j
within about a hundred yartis from the finish, I
when Tailant let out that 100-yard sprint of
his, and simply ran away trom Dave, finishing
the mile in 4:31 1-5, Brown's time being about
one second sluwer. These two moc met in the
half-mile afterward and it was but a repetition !
oi the first race. Dave staid with Tallaut to
within seventy or eighty yards of the finish,
when Tailant again spurted and finished an
easy winner in 2:04.
Tailant is a man 28 years of age, about six
feet tall and weighed 180 pound* when ne met
Dave.
He is married and the father of a family. !
Up to two years ago he never had a running- j
shoe on and did not know anything of ath
letics.
The22o-yÂ»rd race was the best one of the
day. It found Fuller, the winner of the 100- j
yard dash, and Rosenberg, from the Muhuo- I
mahs and Brunton and Gill, from the Olym
pics, competing. When the men lined up' for !
the positions, Brunton had the inside, near- j
est the pole, Fuller was next, tnen Gill aud !
K<i*enberg on the outside.
Brunton started off at a furious pace, deter
mined to keep the lead; Fuller ran even with
him to the curve, when, owing to Brunton's :
superior position, he dropped buck a trifle; >
â¢ iili was directly benind Fuller and Rosenberg )
alougsde of Gill. Wuen about three-quarters
Of the curve had been covered Fuller swayed
out sufficiently to give Giil, who had been i
hugging the rail, a chance to get the inside, j
with the result that as he was tbe stronger of
tiie two he ou. finished Fuller and ran a close ;
second to Brunton in the fast time of 23 1-5
second*, breaking their track record two- j
fifths of a second.
ln the 440-yard event Brunton and Wand
were entered, but owing to an injury which |
WÂ«nd received he was unable to start.
It was promised by the management that if
Wand was unable to compete the Olym
pics could substitute any one of their team in
hiii place, and, although not denying this I
promise, they positively refused tiie Olympics
this privilege at the last moment, with the re- j
suit that Brunton ran against two Multnomah
men, and they fouled him all around the I
track, beating him out eventually in the slow â 
time of 55 seconds.
The Olympics also received unfair treatment i
in the 220-yard hurdle race. They placed the
hurdles in this race directly parallel with
each other, with the result that an Olympic
hurdler who drew an outside position would !
be compelled to run at least eight or ten j
yards further than an athlete who had the in- !
side position.
A protest against the placing of the sticts
was made to the referee, a Mr. Glisanâ who, by
the way, is the president of the Multnomah
Athletic Clubâ but the protest was Ignored. !
Thin matter will be brought before the proper !
authorities, and it will be ascertained whether >
Mr. Glisan had the right to ignore a protest ol
this kind.
Morgan, the Multnomah hurdler, is an ex
ceptionally good man, whom great things mny |
be expected of in the future. His time :a the ,
120 hurdles, of 10 2-5 seconds without being
pressed, was a fine performance, and he cov
ered the 220 hurdles in :2Â« 3-&, another good
performance.
R. W. Edgren easily carried off the honors in
the three weights, und he made many friends
in that part of the world by his gentlemanly
conduct. The mistake the Olympic Cluo
made was ln not sending more men to com
pete, for on the day of the gnmes It had but
six men, and they were pitted against ten
first-class athletes. But, all things considered,
the Olympic Club men made a fine showing.
The Multnomah people expended $6000 on
outdoor athletics last year, and besides having
a care-taker at their grounds they employ a
trainer, a man by the name of King, who has
a thorough perception of all the finer pointsof
track and field athletics, and to him belongs
the credit of the Multnomah Athletic Club |
placing such a strong team in the field. His
men were all in fine condition and they cer
tainly did themselves and Mr. King proud.
What the Olympic Clnb should do is to place
iUelf in correspondence with the Multnomahs
and negotiate for another meet of this kind for
the same time aud place for next year, and in
stead of sending six men to compete send ten,
and the chances are they will come back win
ners.
The Oregonian treated the visitors with a
great deal of consideration, and so did the peo
ple of Portland. One thing is certain, a meet
of this kind is beneficial to outdoor sport, as it
gives the outdoor men something to work for,
and it should be encouraged by tho Olympic
Club. The Olympic Club is an athletic Insti
tution which has gained its prestige in the I
world at larste through Us athletic standing, i
and as its foundation was laid on the same we I
may hope to see track and field athletics prop- I
erly encouraged in the iuture.
Leonard Gill,
Captain of Olympic Club.
The Manhattan Athletic Club will give
an excellent athletic entertainment at its
club rooms, 1749 Mission street, Monday
evening, July 27. The committee is, at
ti'is early hour, arranging a pro ramme
which will consist of ali kinds of indoor
athletics.
According to the sporting article from

appears in this department. Kerrigan, tbe
great jumper, is lying seriously sick at his
home.
THE OARSMEN.
Crews That Left Here Yesterday
for Stocktonâ The Regatta.
The much-talked-of Stockton regatta
takes place to-day on the Stockton Chan
nel. The oarsmen entered in the different
events are in the pink of condition, hav
ing trained faithfully for the contests since
the El Campo regatta on May 30 last, and
if nothing unforeseen happens to dampen
the ardor of the scullers some very spir
ited contests will be witnessed.
To offset the action of the local senior
barge crews the Stockton rowing clubs
have induced the Pacific Coast Amateur
Athletic Association to arrange &** inter
mediate baige race to take the place of the
senior four-oared event.
An intermediate class is something new
ln rowing contests and should meet with
popular favor among oarsmen. When a
man wins a junior race he is eligible to
row an intermediate race before going into
the senior class, and in this way a rower,
after leaving the lower ranks, is given a
better chance to distinguish himseif be
fore meeting the cracKajacks of the senior
class.
If the South End junior crew succeed in
defeating the Stockton junior crew in to
day's event they will row in the interme
diate race against the Stockton giants,
wiio won the junior race at the El Campo
regatta from them by only four feet.
In all five events will be" pulled off at the
regatta, as follows: Junior four-oared
baree, intermediate class; four-oared
barge, senior; single scull, senior outrig
ger skiff and junior single scull events.
The rowing fraternity Jeft in a body last
evening for the scene of the regatta. They
tried to make arrangements for a special
steamer to leave the City at 8 p. m., but
failed in their purpose, and in consequence
there are many people who had intended
to witness the regatta in Stockton will now
remain at home, not caring to make the
triD in the overcrowded regular steamers.
BASEBALL.
Plenty of the National Game to Be
Seen on the National Holiday.
July 4 will see a lively time at the
Presidio grounds. Commencing at 1
o'clock two games of baseball will be
played for one admission. From all re
ports tbe players are on their mettle and
will cut out a lively pace.
The new team admitted into the City
League from Oakland will have a number
j of players that the Oakland people will
| take pride in watching. Among them are
. "Tip" O'Neill, Lou Hardy, Donovan,
Arlett and others. This team is wholly
composed of Oakland players, and will
represent that city not only in name but
with home material.
The Pacifies are the leaders in the race
i so far, with the Imperials right upon their
| heels. Mr. Muller and his Catifornias will
have to "ginger" up or they will find trou
ble landing anywhere near the top. The
young bloods are playing the better game
at present, and that is why the Californias
j are not strong â too many old timers.
I With the admission of the Oakland team
a new schedule will have to be made, and
lovers of the National game may look for
good baseball.

THE BOXERS.
Choynski Signed Articles to Meet
Slavln â Ryan and Green
Matched.
Manager Gibbs of the National Athletic
Club does not like the manner in which
his partner, Groom. <ransacts business.
Groom, it appears, has learned a thing
or two from Gibbs about clubs and how
they should be managed, and as a result
he now has about concluded to play a lone
hand in the game.
Gibbs is ticking in the traces, and says
that Groom cannot pull the wool over his
eyes.
"If Groom wants to rnn a club singly,"
said Gibbs, "let bim go ahead, but he
mast find some other name than that of
the National Club."
It appears that Groom offered a purse
of $6000 for a contest between Choynski
and Maher before he had consulted with
his partner, Gibbs. and, naturally, the lat
ter felt a wee bit huffy on being slighted
thusly.
The break between tne managers is but
very slight, however, and will certainly
amount to nothing, although there are
some people living "who delieht in trying
to make mountains out of mole hills.
Joe Choynski signed articles of agree
ment yesterday to box Peter Maher a ten
round contest before the National Club.
Eddie Graney signed for Maher. The
purse offered by Groom Is $6000.
George Green also signed an agreement
to box Tommy Ryan a ten>round bout, to
take place at the National Club the month
following the Maher- Choynski mil).
Malier has taken his departure from New
York for this city.
Young Mitchell says that neither Smith
nor Gallagher will get a cent of the purse
which the club offered them for a squarely
fought content. He says that it was one of
theÂ»foulest fights he "had ever seen, and
that the pugilists were instructed before
hand that if they fought like dogs and cats
they would not get a cent. He is willing,
however, to allow them their training ex
penses, which is pretty good, considering.
Jim Corbett is at the springs, and he will
need to remain there for fully six months
to tone his exhausted forces.
CRICKET CHIRPS.
Scores on Eastern Fieldsâ To- Day's
and To-Morrow's Games.
Higii scoring seems to be the vogue in
the East as well as in Europe. Playing
for the Philadelphia Club against the
Belford on the 20th ult. H. L. Clark car
ried his bat for 137 without, it is said, giv
ing a single chance.
The Yorkville team defeated the second
eleven of the St. George's Athletic Club at
Central Park, New York, two weeks back.
The Germantown and Merion clubs met
in a championship contest on the former's
ground at Philadelphia at the end of last
month. Effective bowling Dy G. S. Pat
terson and E. W. Clark retired the Merion
team for 67. After losing one wicket. G. S.
Patterson and W. W. Noble made a splen
did stand in partnership for the German
town eleven, bringing the total up to 211
by the call of time. Patterson made GO
without giving the semblance of a chance,
while Noble was credited with 127, not
out, marred only by a difficult chance to
long on when he had made 79.
The New Jersey Athletic and Manhat
tan clubs of the Metropolitan District
League p!ayed a championship game June
20 at Prospect Park, Brooklyn. N. V., the
former scoring 94 for the loss of three
wickets, after retiring the Manhattan
eleven for a total of 90. J. Adam made 34
and H. S. Tattersall 16, not out, for the
Manhattan team, while A. S. Webster, late
of the Bohemian Club of the Cali;ornia
Association, with 30, and W. D. Hickie,
with 20, were the highest scorers for the
New Jersey team.
The cricket correspondents of New York
and Philadelphia announce that a match
between the Australians and an associ
ated team of Californians has been
definitely arranged. I am anxiously
awaiting the publication in one or ot ier
of the Eastern journals of the selected
California team and other particulars.
Up to a late hour yesterday it was
feared that the Ground vs. Ground match,
I projected for to-day, could not be ar
j ranged. AJI hitches have, however, been
j overcome and the game will commence
punctually at noon. Whether the contest
shall last one or two days will be arranged
on the field to-day.
To-morrow the Pacific eleven play the
San Jose team on the Garden City grounds.

BAY FISHING.
Where Anglers Can Enjoy a Good
Day's Sport on Salt Water.
Boy fishing has improved considerably
on the north shore of the bay during the
past week, the fish caught averaging a
larger size than those caught earlier in the
season. Large strings of rockcod, smelt
and perch have been brought over on the
SausaSito and Tiburon ferries during the
last few days.
On Sunday last Frank Denny and a
friend causht about sixty pounds of red
and blue rockcod near Point Cavallo, the
largest a red rockcod weighing three and
a half pounds.
On Monday James Thomsen, the well
known anpler, and companion, caught
fifty-six pounds of red rockcod at Yellow
Bluff and Point Cavallo, the largest weigh
ing two and three-quarter pounds.
Several striped bass have been caught
lately in Sausalito Bay by professional
fishermen using nets. Last Monday one
was caught at the tide-gauge wharf weigh
ing nineteen pounds.
THE GUN.
Inaugural Shoot of the Pacific Tar

One of the most interesting events of the
season, that is so far as trap shooting is
concerned, will take place this afternoon
at Alameda Point. The Pacific Inanimate
Target Association will gather in stron ;
force before the traps and it can be safely
said that some extraordinary scores
will be recorded at the end of the
day's contests, as among the contestants
will flgure several of the be-t inanimate
target shooters of the State. The pro
gramme, which was published in last Sat
urday's Call, is one of excellent selection
and the prizes are of such good value as to
guarantee a large field of entries. The
popular sportsman, Clarence Haight is
authority lor the statement that all visit
ing sportsmen will receive a welcome re
ception and enjoy a general good time. A
hr^t-class luncheon will be served at the
grounds during intermission.

LONG AGO WHEN THE INDIANA
BICYCLE CO. (the largest factory on
earth) declared that they would produce
and guarantee a strictly high grade bicy-
cle for
$75 ssss?â SBs sÂ»5?
That they have fully succeeded is demon-
strated by the fact that more Waverleys
have been built and sold, and won more
friends dnring the past two years than any
other high grade bicycle in the world.
The recent conduct of certain manufac-
turers and agents in connection with their

is a positive admission that they have
either practiced extortion in the past or
are not giving value received in the pres-
ent.

Dr. Wood took a flying trip to the McCloud
River during the past week and bagged
twenty-five large trout in a few hours' fishing.
He states that he had to stop, as his creel was
so full that he Could not carry any more. He
also states that the fish are taking the fly well
and that large catches are being made. James
White captured, a seven-pound striped bass
while fishing in the river this week. The fish
was hooked with a common hook baited with
beet and White played and landed it with a
twelve-foot line on a bamboo pole. Striped
seem to bo quite plentiful in the river
and sloughs this season and it is thought that
they feed on the young of the carp, which
breed in the tules. ,
Intense interest is being displayed in the

Two of Them Caught While in thi
Act of Breaking Op.n the
Cash Register.
Fred f-mith, a bartender at 637 Clay
srreet, wai terribly beaten yesterday after
nuon by a crowd of thu^s, vrho entered the
place with the avowed intention of rob
bing it.
Among them were Thomas Scott and
Ihomas Carroll, who have been arrested
on a charge of robbery, and Charles Carey
nd Edward Himes, who are held on
simple charges of vagrancy, pending fur
ther investigation as to their connection
with the affair.
Smith was performing his duties as usual,
there being already a number of such
hard cases in the place as sometimes make
street, from Montgomery to Kearny,
impassible to timid people.
The men who are now in jail, says Smith,
)ick?d a quarrel with them, and in the
melee that followed bottles and beerglaÃses
were broken, principally on Smith's dead.
While he lay on the floor back of the
bar. half unconscious from his injuries,
Scott and C*rroll took the cash register
and carried it to the rear room of the
saloon.
About ttat time W. P. Hermann, who is
supposed to be proprietor of the place,
happened in. He learned of what had
taken place and interfered with the two
robbers be found in the act of opening the
register. They ran away and Hermann
followed, reaching the California-street
station with his tale of woe.
Policemen Norman and Peters succeeded
in capturing a. couple of the men in the sa
ioon, another on the water front and the
fourth one begging on Market street.
The injured man was taken for repairs
to the Receiving Hospital.

lowing resolution was then introduced by
E. Kendall and adopted by the club:
â \Yherejls. The administration of National af
fairs by the Democrat it party and the bills of
the Wilson-Gorman tariff (or revenue only plan
have resulted in the utter ruin and the de
moralization of the industries of America;
and whereas, the principle of protection to
American industries is now and has ever been
one of the base and fundamental principles of
the Republican party ; therefore, be it
Eesoived, That the Lincoln Republican Club
reallziug the fact that a return to prosperity
can only be secured by providing ways And
means for the employment of American labor,
hereby solicits and earnestly requests the
laboring clauses of the Forty-fourth Assembly
District of the City and County of Ban Fran.
i-JM-o to affiliate in a campaign which shall
have for its fundamental object the protection
of American labor.
The club then adjourned with cheers for
McKinley and protection.

pleted their labors, which will be consum
mated to-da)'.
For the past two months they have la
bored incessantly, and they feel that they
have provided for the patrons of the club
a celebration that will be second to none
ever before attempted by any like organ
ization on the coast.
The programme of games is a most in
teresting one, special care having been
taken to avoid all likelihood ol dragging
or lack of interest. There will be present
at Shell Mound Park a large delegation
from Sacramento, Stockton md neighbor
ing towns and also from each and all of
the bay citieÃ. There will be present also
from the Portland, Los Angeles, San Ber

clubs and St. Andrew's societies, as well
as the Order of Scottish Clans, representa
tive athletes who will contest in the vari
ous games.
Communications are constantly pouring
in to Recorder George W. Pater=on ac
knowledging receipt of invitations ex
tended and assuring the club that in
response thereto representatives will at
tend the gathering of the clans. A large
list of entries has already been received for
the mile bicycle and other races, vaulting,
etc., and a good, lively contest is promised
in each event.
The competition in the Irish and reel
dancing will be particularly interesting,
many of the crack dancers of the coast
having signified their intention of enter
ing. The following comprise the officers
and committees who will officiate at the
coming celebration:

To get up an affair of such magnitude
entails no end of work and to bring it to a
successful issue requires a great deal of
enthusiasm, all of which has been dis
played by the members of the games com

Dr. Arthur F. Marten, charged by Alma
Josslyn with threats to kill, is again in
the toils and is not likely to get out for

Now that I'm arrested again be wants to
charge me $20 for $2000 bail. I've got no

Labor Alliance Denounce) Interference
With Socialist Speaker*.
The Central Trade and Labor Alliance
met lapt night at 102 O'Farrell street, Vice-
President J. H. Jorgensen of tiie Amalga
mated Woodworkers in the chair. A full
attendance of delegates was present from
the various unions.
The Alliance proceeded to a discussion
of the alleged interference with th 6 open
air meetings of the socialists and the ar
rest of one of the speakers while expound
ing his views npon the economic and kin
dred labor questions. The delegates pres-
ent expressed themselves quite forcibly in
condemning the interference of the po'ice
as an outrage, and all were agreed that <he
arrest and interference were of vital im
portance to tbe interests of organized as
well as the mass of unorganized labor.
The following resolution, dealing with the
question, was submitted and unanimously
adopted :
Whereas, There has been an attempt at in
terrupting an orderly public meeting called
for the discussion of economic and Kindred
grievances of the working people under the
auspices of the Socialist Labor party; and,
whereas, the socialists contribute a very im
portant part of their entire leisure time to ob
tain for the worker tbe full reward for his
labor.
Resolved, That we condemn the action of the
police as an unjust and unlawful interference
with the constitutional rights of all citizensâ
the right of free speechâ and assert our tirm
determination to uphold and support the So
cialist Labor party in its laudable and praise
worthy efforts to maintain this, the greatest
prerogative of a free people.
The alliance decided to engage larger
headquarters for its meetings, and it was
j decided to move its offices and headquar
j ters to the Turk-street Temple, where the
j next meeting will be held on Friday even

FIRE ON O'FARRELL ST.
The Damage to Four Buildings Is
~ About 92500â
Fires.
The incendiary 3d of July firecracker
and the 3d of July small boy had their
fun with the Fire Department before their
cousin crackers of this the glorious
Fourth.
The double alarm from box 42, at Geary
and Mason streets, about 10:15 last night,
was for a tire at 217 O'Farrcll street and in
the rear on Carlos place. All were old
frame buildings close to a tali lodging
house on one side, and at first the fire had
a threatening look.
No. 217 O'Farrell street was an unoccu
pied two-story frame dwelling. It was
gutted. The damage is about $1500, and
nobody could be found in the neighbor
hood who knew the name of the owner.
' No. 3 Carlos place was an. old two-story
frame building occupied by Japanese. It
is a wreck. The Japanese got out most of
their effects. On the corner of Carlos
place and O'F.irrell street is a Chinese
laundry. The only damage here was a bad
fright for the Chinamen. These two
buildings .belong to the owner of 217.
Loss about $600.
No. 5 Carlos place is owned by Mrs.
I Nelle," formerly Mrs. Nellie Back. It was
occupied by Sylvester Sullivan. It was
\ burned a little in the rear and the damage
â¢by fire and water is about $300. A small
shanty was also destroyed.
The" building at 215 O'Farrell street is
owned by Mrs. Proff, who occupies It as a
lodging-house in the two upper stories.
The damage to the building and contents
by tire and water is about $200. A restau
rant on â  tne street - floor, kept by Bello &
Origlia, was damaged about $50 by water.
The total loss will not exceed $2500. The
cause of the tire is ascribed to firecrackers.
Fire broke . out . from some : unknown
cause *in a three-story . frame ' dwelling,
957J^ Folsom street, occupied by C. Gold
enstein as a dwelling, at 10:30 o'clock last
evening. Chemical Engine Company 6
was notified and extinguished the blaze.
The damage amounted to about $150.

RACQUET AND NET
AT SAN RAFAEL
Tennis Players Battling for

SOME CLOSE CONTESTS.
Two New Players Put Up Hard
Games Against Vet

EXCITING FINALS EXPECTED.
Driscoll, Hardy and the Two Whit
neys to Struggle for the
Trophy.
The ninth annual lawn tennis tourna
ment for the championship of the Pacific
States is on at San Rafael. The prelimi
nary contests were played yesterday after
noon at the Hotel Rafael courts, the scene
of all championship tournaments since
the organization of the Pacific States Lawn
Tennis Association in 1890.
There was not the concourse of fashion
and tennis enthusiasm present yesterday
which is attendant upon the deciding
games. That will come to-day when the
spectators' area will be crowded with
ardent admirers of the game, and perhaps
more ardent admirers of the players.
Hotel Rafael is already well filled with
parties who have made tbe tournament an
excuse for spending tbe Fourth at San
Rafael, and the management is making
arrangements for an immense crowd to
day.
The first pair of contestants drawn yes
terday was Walter Magee and George Mc-
Chesney. The latter, however, was defeated.
The next draw was George Whitney and
Paul Selby. This was conceded by the
knowing ones to be a gift for Whitney.
They, however, had reckoned without
their Selby, for that young man, although
comparatively new at the game, put up a
rattling contest against the veteran, and
though Whitney won by a score of 6â4,6 â 4,
6âl,6 â 1, he had no opportunities to nap.
The lots were unkind to Mr. Eckart.
He was elected to go up against T. A.
Driscoll, one-time-champion of the coast.
Driscoll bad no difficulty in defeating
Eckart, score 6â3, 6â2.
J. O. Tobin defaulted to Mr. Thatcher
and H. Parker defaulted to A. E. Kaeser.
R. N. Whitney defeated Stone by a score
of 6âl. 6â4. Joseph 8. Tobin defaulted to
Sam Hardy and Dr. George Roth^anger
failed to enter the court against H. Weihe.
The winners of tbe first two prelimin
fr-ies, Magee and George Whitney, were
then pitted against each other. Whitney,
who appeared to be ia fine fettle, started
in at a killing pace and soon had a good
lead on his opponent. Magee, however,

gathered himself together and started to ]
regain lost ground. He was playing a j
remarkably line game and had succeeded j
in bringing the score to live all, or tie,
when some trivial accident caused him to
stop for a moment. The interruption
proved fatal. His stroke seemed to have
lost its effectiveness and Whitney won the
bout. Bcore, 6â3. 7â5.
Driscoll and Thatcher were next up.
Driscoll when in form is one of the tor
notch men of the coast. In 1893 he held
the coast championship and in tourna
ments since he has made the champions
play tennis very industriously. At pres
ent" he is not at his best. He lias recently
returned from college and the examina
tions attendant upon the class of the term
have given him little opportunity for
practice. Thatcher put up a good game,
but Driscoll's skill and experience were
too much for him and he succumbed by a
score of 6â2, 6â2.
Kaiser and K. W. Whitney had an in
teresting contest. The match was scarcely
equal, yet it was nearer so than the spec
tators bad anticipated. Kaeser's game
was much stronger than had been ex
pected, but he was beaten, 6âl, 6â2.
Sam Hardy, one of the best-Known
players on the coast, and W. Weihe of the
California Club, a new man in the tourna
ment, were the last pair on the programme.
Weihe sliou'rt. nccordme to precedent,
have been ne;v us and rattled in this his
first game fu; vie championship, but Weihe
snubbed pr- cede tit atrociously in this re
gard. He played all the tennis he knew
how. and though he suffered defeat he
was the recipient of much congratulation.
The score was 6â2,6 â 2, 6â2.6 â 2.
This morning George Wftitney and
Driscoll and R. N. Whitney and Sam
Hardy will play and the two winners
will play in the final in the after
noon. Sumner Hardy, the coast cham
pion, is at present in Alaska, and as he
will not be on hand to defend the cham
pionship the winner of this afternoon's
contest becomes the champion for the en
suing year.
From yesterday's play it is prophesied
that the Whitney brothers will be called
upon to play tne finals against each other
for the championship.
CAPTAIN JAMES MORAN.
The Police Commissioners Appoint the
Successor of the Late Prop
erty Clerk Cullen.
The vacancy in the department made by
the deatli of Property Clerk Cullen was
filled last evening at the regular meeting
of the Boaid of Police Commissioners,
Sergeant James Moran being promoted to
the clerkship and the title of captain.
Corporal John Green was promoted to
sergeant and Patrolman Henry Sills pro
moted to corporal.
Officer W. H. Jennings was fined ?50 for
being off his beat.
The charge of unofficerlike conduct
against Officers Robert Lean and Patrick
Walsh was dismissed in the case of the
former and the latter was fined $100.
THEY GET NO PURSE.
For Foul Fighting the New Occidental
Club Will Only I'ay Smith and
Gallagher's Expense*.
The board of directors of the New Occi
dental Club met last night to consider the
question of allowing Smith and Gal
lagher, the contestants of Thursday
night's fight at the Pavilion, the purse
for which they fought.
After a short consultation it was unani
mously decided that the only sura allowed
them would be the amount of their ex
penses. The reasons given for this de
cision were that the lighters had violated
their articles of agreement by fouling each
other from the start, and by failing to
give a satisfactory exhibition to the au
dience, while the referea nimself had re
versed his own decision in writing and
declared the bout no contest.
The directors would seem to be sup
ported in this course by the whole sport
ing fraternity, man y of whom openly de
clare that neither Smith nor Gallagher
should be given a cent.
"If we had decided that the men were
entitled to a purse," said Mitchell, "it
would give a black eye to the goddess of
athletics in this City and would have
drawn down severe censure upon the club-
Others would be encouraced to use foul
tactics in the ring, and the organization
would acquire a bad reputation."
CHANGES IN GRAM RATES
They Have Eeen Advanced From
Recent Reductions in the
San Joaquin.
The Southern Pacific Found That It
Was Not Charging All the
Traffic Would Bear.
What are alleged to be clerical errors in
the reduced grain tariff issued by the
Southern Pacific Company last Saturday
has induced that company to put out a re
vised tariff.
Shippers claim that this revision is not
due to errors on the part of clerks, but to
an error of judgment on the part of the
trallic manager as to what the traffic will
bear.
In the revised schedule not only hive
the recently reduced rates been advanced
from a number of points, but reduced
rates are now quoted from thirty-nine
points, as against the nineteen points that
i were originally considered in the field of
' competition entered by the valley road.
In the table that follows are given the
j latest rates ana the figures showing tbe
changes made in the schedule of a week
ago. The rate is given In cents per ton of
2000 pounds in carloads of cot less than
2-1,000 pounds:
These rates are immediately operative.
A peculiar phase of this latest action of
the Southern Pacific Company is the right
it arrogates to itself of violating the plain
reading of the constitution of the State,
which says:
And whenever a railroad corporation shall,
for the purpose of competing with any other
common currier, lower its rates for transporta
tion of passengers or freight from one point to
another, such reduced rates shall not be Â«gain
raised or increased from such standard with
out the consent of the governmental author
ity in which shall be vested the power to regu
late fares and freights.
It is surmised from this that the com
pany has not only determined to ignore the
existence of the Railroad Commission, but
to defy the power of the State to control it
in any way or by any method.
UNWELCOME CALLERS.
They Used a Lead Pipe and a Knife on
an Old Defenseless French
man.
W. Harris and C. Edwards, arrested
early yesterday morning on charges of
disturbing the peace, were booked again
last nig'.t on a charge of assault with a
deadly weapon.
The two prisoners are accused of having
called on an old Frenchman at his home,
1300 Stockton street, at 5 o'clock in the
morning, and when he opened his door to
their appeal for admission they struck him
with a lead pipe and essayed to cut him
with a knife. The man's screams, however,
frightened his assailants, who ran away,
onTy to be arre3ted later by Policemen P.
A. Peshon and J. Duane.
Robbery, if not murder, is believed to be
the incentive to the crime.
A Grateful Dog.
One who recently paid a visit to Guy's
Hospital tells that when in the colonnade
ot the institution, and about to leave, he
became the object of demonstrative atten
tion on the part of a small dog, Prince by
name, as he afterward ascertained. It
seems teat last winter Prince sustained a
fracture of a hind leg. and, entirely on his
own initiative, dragged himself into the
hospital precincts and applied for surgical
relief. It was granted ungrudgingly ; the
leg was put in plaster and the dog was
given nursing ana aliment suitable to bis
kind. In the fullness of time he was made
a whole, if slightly tame, dog, and it was
intimated to him that be might return to
NEW TO-DAY.

Never failing in its invigorating powers it has made thousands of

get it at once. It is free on application, and will point out a
course by which you can become a healthy and happy man.
Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt has a regulator, and the electric
power can be turned on mild or strong at will. No other belt
made has it.
Act to-day. In a matter of this kind â a matter which con-
cerns the happiness not only of yourself, but of your family and
friends, of your future generationsâ you should not delay.

PRESS OENSORSHIP.
One Journal in Raasia That Is Espe
cially Favored.
There is only one exception, one news
paper in St. Petersburg, which has the
privilege of free speech and is permitted
to criticize the Government with a free
dom that is almost inconceivable, when
one considers the severity of the treatment
to which other less favored journals are
subjected. The journal in question ia the
Grajdanin, or Citizen, and the immunity
which it enjoys may be attributed
to the fact that its editor and pro
prietor, Prince Metcherski, the Mus
covite counterpart of the English
Henry Labonshere, is the younger brother
of that lovely Princess Metcherski to
whom the late .Emperor Alexander 111
was affianced before he was compelled by
his father, much against his will and
solely on dynastic grounds, to marry the
betrothed of his dead brother, the
Princess Dagmar of Denmark. Alexander
111, although he subsequently became
much devoted to his charming Czarina,
never altogether forgot his first love, who
had been forced by Alexander II to wed
Paul Demidoff during the absence of her
imperial lover in the Caucasus.
Throughout his life he manifested an
affection that can only be. described as
paternal for her two children, and invari
ably permitted her brother to have free
rein, the Prince being probably the only
man in the whole of the great Russian
i empire to eujoy that privilege. As the

Prince is likewise a great friend df young
Emperor Nicholas, who much admires his
brilliancy, it is unlikely that tbe im
munity untiJ now accorded to him will be
in any way curtailed aurine the present
reign.
Foreign newspapers that enter Russia
are invariably subjected to examination
by the postal authorities before being de
livered to the person to whom they are ad
dressed, and if the censor finds anything
therein that is objectionable either to tbe
imperial family or to the Government he
passes a roller of printer's ink over the
portion of the paper to which exception is
taken, the journal frequently at the end of
the process presenting an aspect similar
to that of a chessboard. Sometimes the
pos'al authorities take the trouble to send
a paper thus treated on to its destination,
bnt in the majority of cases it is merely
pitched aside and is never heard of again.
It is the same in Ruumania, a country
from which almost every -New York news
paper wa3 rigorously barred at the time of
the Helen Vacaresco scandal, in conse
quence of unfavorable comments upon
the conduct of Crown Prince Ferdinand
and of Queen Carmen Sylva in tbe affair.
In a number of instances the Govern
ment, in addition to barring out the ob
jectionable foreign newspaper, likewise
denies it the privilege of maintaining a
correspondent within its dominions, the
most notable instance that occurs at tne
present moment being that of the London
Telegraph, which is forbidden to hare any
correspondent in Russia, the letters which
it receives from that country being sent at
the peril of the writer, who incurs the
danger not alone of expulsion, but of im
prisonment, and if he happens to be a
Muscovite, of deportation to Siberia. â

transacted in product, which was surprising in
view of the dullness prevailing In other parts of
the floor. A higher hog market imbued shorts

DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK. N. V., July 3.-R. G. Dun A Co.
will say to-morrow In their weekly review of trade:
Complete failure returns for the second quarter of
1896, April 1-June 30. inclusive, cover 2995 in the
United Mates, against 2885 in the same quarter of
last year. Failures for the week have been 267
in the United States, aeainst 250 last year and â¢'?
in Canada against 24 JaÃt ye*r.
Current movements have been so largely of
temporary character, or else purely speculative on
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JULY 4, 1896.
theday by day . plan, that they are â¢ not highly In
structive. Thus, an extensive shut-down of cot
ton-mil'.s Is solely in the hope that half production
in July and August may clear a largely over
stocked market. Stock fluctuations are still more
ephemeral. ; ; '
Extended reviews of the half-year's operations
In leading branches of manufactures go far to ex
plain numerous stoppages. Mills are waiting for
orders, the sales of woo! having been not a third of
last year's for the tame week. Prices are de
pressed, but still depend on foreign possibilities.
In cotton goods the closing of many miils, both
North and South, for half of July and August is in
effect a recognition of the fact that heavy stocks
of goods, manufactured from cotton costing be
tween 7%@8%c, could not be expected to show
profits if the mills go on manufacturing until a
new and probably heavy crop of cotton Is ready.
The reduction of prices has brought out a large
demand in many cases, but not enough to meet
the output of the mills. A further decline in print
cloths to 2%c is significant when such a decrease
in production is assured.
Having begun by reducing prices to the lowest
ever known boot and shoe producers are doing a
shade bettor iv prices, with leather a little cheaper.
The output of iron has largely decreased and
there is a quite general stoppage of works for re
pairs, but the annual controversies about wages
have in most cases been settled and it is believed
will be settled in all without strikes. Wheat de
clined %c and recovered Vie, but Western re
ceipts continue remarkably large. The stocks in
sight lire greater than a year ago, and though win
ter Wheat yields less, spring Wheat seems likely
with fair ueatber, to yield more than last year.
Corn 1 romises remarkably well, and also Oats.
Cotton srea:ly needs rain in parts of Texas, but
better reports come from most of the other sections
and a large Increase In acreage is generally re
ported.

COALâHarrison s circular says: -During the
week there have been six arrivals from the north
ern collieries with 13.162 tons of Coal, and tbr^e
from Australia with 62!1i) tons. The labor disturb
ances at Newcastle. N. S. W., have not yet oeeu
compromised, hence no cargoes are being shipped
from that section. During the week we have bad
two arrivals of Newcastle Coal, which leaves at
present only two now afloat, and these are all that
can poMtibly arrive oelore September next. Some
of the cargoes arriving recently have changed
hands two or three times, each time at a protit, as
our market is about entirely bare of the lietier
grades of ( ulonial Coals. It is merely a matter of
surmise when the strike will be ended, as no one
in ; he trade here supposed it could possibly be pro
longed as ll has been, and recently received cables
do not promise an early settlement. Meanwhile
an Increased demand has sprung up for our Coast
Droducs and tor Swansea Anthracite to u.k<> the
pla eof Wallsend for steam uses. Some of our in
terior gus companies will shortly be in the market
to replenish their stocks at prices considerably
higher than their last purchases, as their ( onsumo
tlon consists principally of Gretu and Wallseud."

lAndlns, Uiaaiea 1. Piwa*REVENGE FOR HIS
LOST WHISKERS,
Attorney Langan Alleged
to Have Bared Adam
May's Chin.
HE DENIES THE CHARGE
The Affair Happened Under Con
ditions Not Favorable to
Friendship.
THE SUFFERER'S GREAT WRATH
Lively Times at Haywards While
a "Celebration" Was in
Progress.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, July 3. f
Justice Pimental of Haywards called a
case this morning that is being watched
with great interest by the whole neighbor
hood.
The cases belli is a handful of whiskers,
Adam May, One of Haywards' Respected Citizens, Who Charges Attorney
Langan With Removing His Missing Whiskers.
and when the trial comes off they will
figure as "exhibit A. plaintiff." Some
weeks ago they adorned- the chin of Aaam
May, one of Hiy wards' most prominent
and respected merchants.
George S. Langan, one of the most re
spected and prominent attorneys in the
county, figures as the defendant in the
suit, and he is charged by the people of
the State of California with disturbing
tneir peace and dignity by detaching the
said whiskers from the lower portion of
Mr. May's face.
There is a remarkable feature to the
case. Mr. May and Mr. Langan are firm
iriends under certain conditions. They
Lave lived in Haywards and have re
soected each other for many years. Nei
ther would harm one hair of the other's
head, and the present unpleasant affair
would never have occurred had the "cer
tain conditions" referred to prevailed on
the unlucky day when the whiskers left
Mr. May's face.
On the day in question there was a cele
bration at Haywards, and con equently it
was an "off" day, and several prominent
citizens were like the day. Whether the
principals in the suit that is now interest
ing all Haywards were of that number or
not will be developed at the trial.
Another peculiar feature of the case is
that Mr. Lankan does not remember the
whisker-pullinjr, and consequently "on in
formation and belief" he denies that he is
responsible for the bare place on Mr. May's
ci.in. He is certain that "under certain
conditions" he would never have put a
hand on his friend May, much less on bis
whiskers.
â¢ Attorney Langan has, it is said, an in
terest- in a place of business at Hay wards
at present run by Messrs. McCall &
Some time ago there was an opportunity
for Mr. Langan to make a deal with the
place, but just before it was consummated
Mr. May stepped in, and the deal had to
be declared off.
"Recognizing that all is fair in love and
real estate deals Mr. Langan does not ap
pear to remember how he was treated
By his friend May, except under cer
tain conditions." These conditions pre
vailed when the whisker episode occurred,
and the memories of both men were sud
denly refresned. Then something hap
pened, but nobody seems to know just
wnat or how.
All that is known is that Mr. May lost
tome whiskers and swore to a complaint
charging Mr. Langan with transplanting
them. Mr. Langan has been called the
"Billy Foote of Haywards" on account of
his aggressive persistency in the court
room, and he frequen-tly arouses marked
interest daring the progress of a casein
which he is an attorney. Now that he is
both attorney and defendant something
special is expected. The case was con
tinued this morning and will probably be
tried next week.
WERE AFTER DRINKS.
Two WelJ-Known Young Men Who Were
Caught Kobbinc a Saloon.
OAKLAND; Cal., July 3â Officer Jaco-
I)ii9 captured two well-known young men
last night as they were going through a
saloon in East Oakland about midnight,
and took them to the City Prison, where
they were charged with burglary.
One of the offenders la William J. Goo
by, a promising young boxer, who has ap
peared in the contests ol the local clubs,
whiie the other is George Lamb, a cousin
of Thomas Lamb, the younj; fellow re
cently killed by Police Officer Lee Andrews
while trying to escape from custody. Lamb
was captured as he came out of the saloon
with several bottles of "wet goods" in his
arms, and Gooby was found a little later
under the back steps, where he had hidden
when he saw his partner captured.
FOR BETTER STREETS.
Mercantile Bodies to Work in Harmony
With tli.- Good Koadi Asso
ciation.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 3.â An open j
j meeting of the Board of Trade was held
; last night to consider the problem of im
, proving the streets. M. K. Miller, City
| Street Superintendent, read an elaborate
paper, and after a discussion the following
resolutions were unanimously passed:
Wherkas, Firstâ lt has been shown to our
satisfaction that streets rank first among fac- j
| tors affecting ihe growth, commerce and pros- |
[ perity of the city.
Secondâ That at the present time many of
1 our streets are badly worn and out of repair.
Thirdâ That this is particularly the case
with East Twelfth and East Four
teenth streets and Telegraph avenue,
the streets which we recognize as the main
thoroughiares of the city, an.i which, on
account of the excessive travel thereon, should
in justice to the abutting property-owners be
reconstructed in part at the expense of the
city.
Fourthâ That fund' must be raised to per
mit ol the execution of these necessary im
provements, and that n tux-rate which com
pares favorably with the rates fixed by all the
leading cities in the State will provide more
than sufficient money for the proposed work;
therefore, be it
Sesoiicd, Firstâ That it is the sense of the
Oakland Board of Trade, Merchants' Exchange
I and Good Roads' Association that the imme
diate improvement of our streets generally is
uecessary to suDserve the best interests of our
ci tv*
Secondâ That the City Council should im
mediately require the property-owners to re
macadaniize ihe worn-out streets.
; Thirdâ That, on account of their great com
mercial importance to the city, the main
I thoroughfares should be immediately recon
structed on modern and permanent lines.
Fourthâ That the adoption by the city of a
definite policy for future repairs and main
; tenance is now absolutely necessary to pre
serve existing improvements, and to eucour
i age property-owners to remacadamize worn-out
! streets.
j Fifthâ That we favor and recommend to the
City Council a tax rate for this fiscal year
which will be sufficient to provide for the
execution of all ordinary repairs on all streets,
and half the cost of the reconstruction of the
main thoroughfares through East Oakland, in
addition to the usual expanse of the city gov
ernment, and that a special fund for that pur
pose be established.
The following committee was appointed
i to present the resolutions to the City Coun
! oil. John A. Britton and S*th Mann of
the Good Road 9 Association. President W.
V. Witcher and George Roeth of the
Merchants' Exchange and President J. P.
Taylor and M. J. Keller of the Board of
Trade.

OAKLAND, Cal., July 3.â The Oakland
! Water Company is not anxious for a repe
j tltion of the "demonstration" made on
| their main pipe at Alvarado last Fourth of
: Juiy. On that occasion, a section of pipe
was blown up at Alvarado, where it crossed
| the marsh, and the salt water got into the
| main and caused much trouble and un
i pleasantness. To-day President Dargie
employed twenty men to patrol along the
line of the trestle to protect against a simi
lar piece of vandalism.
Reads Like a Conundrum.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 3.â The San Le
j andro Standard to-day contains the fol
lowing:
A Chinese merchant of San Lorenzo recently
{ had a two-story building erected, to be used as
: a store and, presumably, opium "joint." The
i building was located on a prominent street,
â  and was near the church and public hall.
Much dissatisfaction whs felt over the matter
; by the white residents of San I<orenzo, and
j when, on Wednesday night, it burned to the
I ground not much surprise was manifested.
I The Chinese merchant will probably select a
new site the next time he builds.
Was Not Insane.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 3.â L. Casemino,
the Italian who it was alleged in an in
sane moment attempted to tire Pieasan
ton, was acquitted of the charge of in
sanity by Judge Frick and Drs. J. H.
Dunn and B. A. Rabe. No witness ap
peared against him.

THE SAX FKAXCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JULY 4, 1896.
A HOMEOPATH
GETS THE PLUM,
Dr. Mayon Deposed as
Health Officer of
Oakland.
DR. BRADLEY SUCCEEDS.
The Agony of the Other Officials
Prolonged Till Next
Meeting.
MAT BE A COMPLETE CHANGE.
The Ex-Officer Thinks He Might Have
Been Allowed to Finish
His Term.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,) I
908 Broadway, July 3. j
A homeopathic physician was elected by
ihe Board of Health to-night. It was the
first time that a member of the new school
has been installed in that position. The
meeting of the board was held just one
minute and a half, but it was a very inter
esting one and marked the partial culmi
nation of a plan to work a complete change
in the department.
A year ago Mayor Davie appointed two
homeopaths on the board, but Dr. Sarah
Shuey declined to vote for the Mayor's
candidate for secretary, and as none of the
holdover members would change, nothing
could be done till a week ago, when two
additional homeopaths were appointed.
The new members were Drs. Chamberlain
and Small, and, with Dr. Larkey, they
controlled the board.
To-day notices were sent out for a spe
cial meeting for the purpose of electing
officers. Dr. Shuey, the president of the
board, is out of the City, and Dr. Beck
with, the lone allopath, proposed that Dr.
Small be made temporary chairman.
It was very evident that the three
homeopaths had caucussed and prepared
a programme, for everything went like
clockwork. Dr. Chamberlain moved that
the office of Health Officer, at present held
by Dr. Mayon, be declared vacant. Dr.
Larkey seconded. Dr. Small put the
question, he merely asking for the "ayes,"
and declared tne vote. Dr. .Larkey re
minded him that there were others. "Oh,
I meant no slur," said Dr. Snail address
ing l>r. Beckwith. "I thought, perhaps,
you intended to spare my feelings," said
the allopath.
"I wish to propose for the office of
Health Officer a man known to us allâ Dr.
E. W. Bradley," said Dr. Larkey. Dr.
Chamberlain seconded the nomination,
and by the three homeopathic votes Dr.
Bradley of that school was made Health
Officer.
There were several communications on
the table irom applicants who wished to
succeed Paul Schaffer, secretary, who has
filled the office for six years. Dr. Cham
berlain moved that having removed the
Chief officer enough had been done lor one
night, and that the communications be
j laid on the table. Tnis prevailed. The
; board then adjourned.
It is very evident that the board intends
; to make further changes as one of the ap
\ plications is from C. O. Alexander, tx
j Harbor Commissioner of San Francisco,
who is known to be Mayor Davie's candi
! date. Ed Finch and R." O. Whitehead are
! also anxious to succeed Scbaffer. Thp other
, places in the gift of the board are the in
; spector of nuisances and bis two assist-
I ants. Dr. Mayon'a retirement is not be-
Dr. E. W. Bradley, the Firsf Homeopathic Health Officer of Oakland.
cause of inefficiency, for his regime has
met with the most favorable criticism and
many wonder why he was not given an
opportunity to resign. The triumvirate,
however, decided otherwise.
Dr. Bradley is a homeopath, and since
1881 has practiced in Oakland. He first
opened an office at Thirteenth and Broad
way with his father, Dr. H. L. Bradley
but a year later moved to East Oakland. '
I Last year he was appointed by tho
I Mayor as a member of the Board of
! Health. His seat was contested, and
j through the opinion of the Attorney-Gen
i eral the case was never taken into court.
Dr. Bradley is a brother of Attorney Tom
; Bradley, and, with his wife and four
I children, lives at 618 East Fourteenth
street.
Health Officer Mayon, when spoken to
in regard to his removal, said he had no
criticism to make farther than that he
felt he ought to have been allowed to fin
ish out his term of two years. He did not
think it just right to remove him without
cause.

PROPERTY OF THE STATE
Steam and Electric Roads and
Part of the Long
Wharf
Are Sold Owing to Delicquency in
the Payment of State and
County Taxes.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,!
COS Broadway, July 3. )
The County Tax Collector to-day at 11
o'clock officially declared, in conformity
with the law, all property upon which
State and County taxes remain unpaid
sold to the State. Tms act takes the place
of the former delinquent tax sale, where
property upon which taxes had not been
paid was sold to tax scarps, who would
cinch the property-owner upon redemp
tion. The total amount of the delinquent
tax upon property sold nas not yet been
Loured ud, but it is quite large.
The property of the Consolidated Pied
mont Cable Company was among that
which passed to the State. The Piedmont
and Mountain View Railway, which has
succeeded to the ownership oi the plant of
the former road, was one of the corpora
tions which cont sted the assessment of
Danon'sand tendered the tax as named
by the Supervisors sittiug as a County
Board of Equalization. This action was
declared invalid later by the Superior
Court, and an appeal is now pending.
A suit was filed yesterday and a tempo
rary restraining order issued against the
Tux Collector contingent upon the tiling
of a bond, but at the hour of the sale no
bond bad been filed.
The assessment of the California and
Nevada narrow-gauge road from Emery
ville into Contra Costa County was allowed
to become delinquent. Five and a half
miles of the road, valued at $22,000 by the
State Board of Equalization, was sold, be
ing a gain of $7 14 tor each |school dis
trict. The entire length of the road is
twenty-three miles, assessed at $92,000.
The road at present is in the hands of a
receiver during a cor. test between the va
rious bondholders. One o. these suits will
come up next week in San Francisco.when
it may be decided who is the proper party
to pay the taxess.
Tne State secured certain property from
the Southern Pacific Company, upon
which it is claimed there is a double as
sessment, one by the County Assessor and
the otuer by the State Board of Equaliza
tion. Among this was 8000 feet of Long
wharf. The tax on this was $3319 25. Also
iorty miles of side tracks and switches,
which it is claimed were not assessed by
the State Board of Equalization, the
Seventh-street franchise and track and
other personal property. The Mount
Eden Cnion Church, with a quarter of an
acie of land on the county road, near the
I lands of Mobr, Whisbye & Penke, were
sold to the State for %7 53.
There were 3270 acres of oyster-beds
taken by the State, which it is believed
will furnish the officials with all the
i bivalves they need.
The Piedmont and Mountain View
i Railroad Company paid $2401 89 taxes to
City Treasurer Giipin after the sale of de
| linquent property began under protest and
I thus saved it being sold. The protest was
| against the valuation placed on the road
| and franchise.
The sale of the Southern Pacific Rail
road for delinquencies footing up to
! $736*3 75 was withdrawn on the written
i order of Auditor Snow, who believes the
| city would suffer by such a sale. It covers
; their tax on the Seventh-street local, the
tracks at Long wharf and the railroad
yards, which the company claims were
assessed twice.
Tbe Tax Case.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 3.~The matter
of tho assessment of the Pacific Postal
Telegraph-Cable Company and tbe right
of the Assessor to seize the personal prop
erty of the company to satisfy a lien was
raised to-day upon the discussion of the
demurrers to the complaint of the Postal
Company to compel the restoration of the
property seized, and to restrain the As
sessor from selling it.
The attorneys for the Assessor contended
that the allegation of an inequitable as
sessment was yet to be established, and
that the company bad its remedy in pay
ing the tax under protest and then appeal
ing to the County Board of Equalization.
In case the protest was sustained the over
charge would be rebated.
BAROTEAU WILL
LEAVE OAKLAND.
The Baron to Negotiate
His Title for an
Heiress.
EVERYTHING HAS GONE.
His Only Hope Is in a Matri
monial Alliance for
Revenue.
ACCEPTS HIS FOELORN STATE.
All His Schemes Have Enriched
Others, but Have Left Him
Alone and Poor.
Oakland Office Ran Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, July 3. j
Bereft of his wife by the action of a di
vorce court; without a vestige of his
former fortune; unremembered in the
Fourth Ward, where he once posed as a
Republican leader; forsaken by men who
are now profiting by his schemes, Baron
Alfred Baroteau has been forced to look
elsewhere for solace and comfort and inci
dentally coin.
At his age and with his record, which
contains much that is unenviable, but
more that is enviable, the lord of Chateau
Baroteau feels that it is indeed hard to be
financially embarrassed.
The Baron has brains â too many of
them. Had he but one-half and had he
used them for his own exclusive benefit
he would to-day be a rich man. But he
has used his gray matter to benefit others,
who now do not even call him a philan
thropist, but something else.
A few months ago the Baron organized
a scheme to go down and occupy a large
portion of Lower California. He com
menced to fit out an old bark and drew
down on himself the wrath of the Secre
tary of War, who instructed the Collector
of the Port to keep a sharp eye on the
Baron. The project was feasible, the deeds
to the land were good, but the Baron was
too loquacious and killed his own goose on
the eve of its laying a golden egg. It was
pitiable, too, for the Baron has need of all
the eggs he oan get now, and especially
golden ones.
"But I am not downed, "said the baron to
night. "I am overso, but I am still a good
looking fellow, and although many people
take me fora fool, I am not one. I have
a new scheme, and the only objection to it
is that it will take me out of Oakland and
that will disappoint my friends, who have
been eating my suDpers, drinuing my
wine and listening to my stories for so
many years.
"Of coure I am dead socially, politically
and financially, but I still own my mind
and it is safe from attachment. Now, I
have placed myself in communication
with a matrimonial bureau in Chicago. I
am informed that there are scores of
stupid old rich papas who would put up
anything to see their girls marry some
one with a title. No one can dispute my
claim to my title. It is recognized every
where but in France. The old Cnateau
Barsteau stands on a hill overlooking Mar
seilles Harbor, and it was there that my
ancesteors lived for many years.
"I have nothing to be ashamed of. I
have done the best I could and should
France again become a monarchy I should
recover my estate and Baron "Baroteau
would once more be a nobleman. What
American heiress would not be t>roud to
live at Chateau Baroteau? It is of course
hard to leave Oakland, but there is noth
ing more for me here and I must catch
somebody before I am too old."
The Baron is very determined and is in
earnest. For a time he was the Talbot
Clifton of Oakland, but his title, although
it gained him a wife with property, from
whom he has juÂ«t been divorced, has no
morn commercial value in Alameda
County.
A STARTLING STATEMENT
Leydecker Unfolds a Scheme
to Obtain Influence for
Delanoy.
F. N. Delanoy Denies the Whole
Thing â a Peculiar Sentence
Passed by Judge Swasey.
ALAMEDA, Cal., July 3.â After Trus
tee Clark had given his evidence last
Wednesday afternoon in the Fleming in
junction case against the City Trustees
Judge Frick announced that he wished no
further evidence tendered, as it would
only be cumulative. Trustee Leydecker,
who was in attendance, was therefore not
called to the witness-stand.
By Trustee Leydecker's statements it
would appear that F. N. Delanoy is the
party who is charged with offering contin
gent political preferment.
Trustee Leydecker does not mince mat
ters. He says Delanoy came to his place
of business in Sun Francisco before he,
Delanoy, had taken the stand. While
there he asked Leydecker to stand in with
them. When asked who the "them" was
Leydecker says he replied: ''Come in
with us on this electric-light proposition.
Now I will tell you. We have $150,000 to
$200,000 at the back of us. Your political
ambition is to be a Supervisor of Alameda
County. 1 can get it for you. I, me
(tapping his own breast). I have the
political influence in Oakland to get it for
you. We want your support. I have
seen Hammond and Fletter and they are
all right. Now all we want is you and it

Mr. Leydecker saw Trustees Hammond
and Flitter that evening and they denied
ever seeing Delanoy on the matter.
Delanoy was seen this evening and he
emphatically denies all Mr. Leydecker
says.
"I have no wish to enter into any con
troversy. I was down East street one day,
and as I was thirsty I entered the tirst

DEATH CAME SUDDENLY,
L. E. White's Demise a Sur
prise to His Many
Friends.
A Man Universally Esteemed by a
Large Circle of Acquaint
ances.
BERKELEY, Cal., July 3.â The death
of L. E. White, the "Mendocino lumber
king," who expired at Cazadero on .a&t
Wednesday, has come as a gre;it shock not
only to the men with whom he was
directly associated for so many years, bnt
also to the business circles of the State at
large. He was one of those broad-minded
men whose influence upon his associates
was inspiring in the extreme, and whose
business integrity brought admiration
even from his enemies.
Both at the fireside and in the activity
of a bustling business life he possessed a
meekness and equanimity of nature which
engendered the highest respect of every
one. While he was a man of much wealth
and influence and moved in the highest
circles of society he did not forget those
who were at the bottom of the ladder
when he was there, but who had not been
so fortunate in its ascent and in the
accumulation of this world's goods.
He came to California from Massachu
setts in June, 1849, crossing the plains in a
canvas-covered wagon.
Immediately upon reaching here he
went into the mining business, and subse
quently into the lumber trade, which left
him at his death a millionaire.
He was perhaps as well known to the
lumber-dealers of the State as any other
I man, and by his uprightness and business
integrity seems to have well earned for
himself the name of the "Lumber King."
For the iast years of his life he had been
a constant sufferer from a varied compli
cation of diseases, and had been continu
ously under the care of a physician. He
went to Cazadero with his wife a few
weeks ago in the hope of improving, but
he gradually grew worse until he finally
succumbed."
He leaves a widow, Celia A. White, be
sides two children by his former wife â
Mrs. N. E. Stewart and William E. White.
He was also the brother of Mrs. J. 8.
Kirn ball of Seminary Pane and of Carl A.
White of Highland Park, East Oakland.
His son William has been largely conduct
ing his father's business for the past four
years. The estate of the "Lumber King"
is estimated at something like $1,000,000,
most of which is invested in lumber for
ests in Mendocino County. He also owned
considerable real estate in San Francisco
and Berkeley, as well as small properties
in various other sections of the State.
He had been a resident of Berkeley six
years immediately prior to his death. He
left his entire estate to his wife and chil
dren.
The funeral will take place next Sunday
afternoon at 2 o'clock from his late resi
dence on Ward and Ellsworth streets.
The ceremony will be performed by Rev.
George E. Swan of the Berkeley Episco
pal Church. The interment will be pri
vate.
The Hegcue Car.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 3.â The gospel
car "Florence Crittenton," which is the
property of Charles N. Crittenton of res
cue fame and millionaire evangelist, is in
Oakland, and will remain here while he
holds a revival in Dr. Dille's church in San
Francisco. The party that occupies this
home on wheels is composed of Mr. Crit
tenton, C. 8- Morton, Joseph Carpenter,
Frank Wallace and C. Green.
Verdict of Murder.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 3.â Dr. Porter,
who held an autopsy upon the remains of
the infant found in the cave out on the
Cluremont road, at the inquest testi
fied that it had been alive after birth and
died from strangulation. The jury re
turned a verdictof murder by an unknown
person.
From Rubber Overshoes.
Don't throw away your worn-out rub
bers. A strip cut from one of them and
wound around a penholder will relievo
writer's cramp.
Narrow strips nailed on the door casing
will prevent many a nerve-wrecking slam
or they will do as weather strips.
Sharp ends of rockers do no harm with
a tip of dark rubber, and heavy picture
frames do not mar the walls with a fold of
the same rubber shoe tacked on the edge
which touches the wall.
Neat waterproof mats on which to set
flower vases are made with pinked edges.
Knee protectors for the small boy may
be made from an old pair of rubbers, and
serviceable sponge- holders for the bath
room are also made from these discarded
shoes.
When cold weather makes iron danger
ous to touch the iron pump-handle may
have a rubber holder attached, and the
Kitchen cook-book may have corners for
the binding made from the same rubber.
It is said that all the burglars' "jim
mies" in London are made by one man,
who is well known to the police, but can
not be arrested, as his work is not con
trary to law. Besides, it is very conven
ient to be able to trace his customers.

The structure will be a three-story brick,
with an elevation of fifty-nine feet above
the level of the street. The front of the !
first story will be constructed entirely of j
plate glass and iron, and in the second !
and third stories the windows will also be i
of plate gla-s. The entire front of buff
Roman brick, with cream terra cotta trim

the idea of a better location, a long lease
and an improved business.

RAUER'S MESSAGE.
How It Was Transmitted by the West

The Western Union Telegraph Com

TO JAIL WITH KUHLMAN,
The Effect of Judge Beatty's
Decision in His
Case.
The Ten Days Judge Wallace Gave
Him Must B> Served in
Prison.
Dr. Charles G. Kuhlman must remain
for ten days in jail to pay for the brief
privilege of refusing to be sworn as a wit
ness at the Coroner's inquest over the body
of Jens Sonderup.
The inquest was called on June 22, and
Dr. Kuhhuan was called to testify as to
the ailments of Sonderup previous to his
death, and relying on the decision of the
coort by which he was before set freeâ that
the Coroner's jury had been improperly
organized â be refused to be sworn at all.
Coroner Hawkins cited him for contempt,
and Judge Wallace sentenced him to ten
days' imprisonment. He appealed to the
Supreme Court on habeas corpus, and the
cause was set belore Chief Justice Beaity
in chambers.
The case came before the Chief Justice
yesterday, and after short arguments, the
Chief Justice wrote the following across
the back of the application for the writ:
On return to the writ issued herein, and
after hearing of the parties, my conclusion is
that the imprisonment of the petitioner is not
unlawful. It is, thgrerore, ordered that he be

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JULY 4, 1896.
BIG MATCH RACE TO-DAY
I
The Crack Pacers W. Wood and
Waldo J Will Once More
Try Conclusions.
INGLESIDE'S GREAT EVENT
General Interest Manifested in the
ResUitâ An Immense Crowd Will
Witness the Contest.
This is the closing day of the trotting
and pacing meet at Ingleside, and the big
match for $2500 a side between W. Wood,
2:07, -the Oakwood stock farm's great geld
ing, and Waldo J., 2:08, the gray ghost
from Santa Paula, is the attraction, and
the affair is attracting widespread atten
tion among lovers of harness horses
throughout the State. Both horses are in
superb condition, and a barrel of coin will
be wagered on the result. In the East
great crowds flock to see the pacing
wonders, Joe Patchen and John R. Gentry,
and with propitious racing weather the
management expects to see the grand
stand and betting ring at Ingleside
crowded with lovers of the noble animal.
As on the preceding days of the week,
laaies will be admitted to the course with
out charge. Seldom are two horses so
evenly matched brought together on
the Pacific Slope, and an equine battle
should result that will go down in the
annals as one of the memorable contests
of the California turf.
James Mack, thu owner of Waldo J,
stated yesterday that the gray ghost is
not eligible to the 2:10 class, and tnat this
will probably be his only appearance in
this part of the State during the year. The
race will be te.Â«t two in threu heats.
As the programme is composed of four
well-filled events, the starters in the first
race will be calied out by Starting Judge
McNear at 1:30 o'clock.
Second only to tfie big match race is the
2:19 trot for a purse of $1000, with a field
of ten starters. Prince ira, 2:19^, the
crack Chico mare, Mamie Griffin, and <>il
patrick, the last Salinas horse, are among
the starters.
In the 2:35 pace, Sindwood, said to be
the most promising son of the Orange
County idol, bilk wood, will appear along
with other last ones.
The Butcher's race, best two-in-three
heats, will hardly prove a less greater at
traction than the professional trials of
speed. All the gentlemen entering horses
in the race are members of the Butchers'
Board of Trade, an' 1 that body, it is said,
will be out in full force.
The board ol appcais met yesterday, and
after hearing all of ihe testimony, exoner
ated J. R. Albertson from all blame in
connection wit the peculiar s>nowing oi
the horse iStrathmont some days ago, and
removed his two years' sentence of suts
pension. It was shown that Mr. Albert
son, who is not an experienced knight of
the sulky, was ill on me day ol the race,
and that the owners had demurred about
letting him drive. James Dustin also let
the owner of the green pacer off with a
$100 fee for his services in the sulky, in
stead of accepting halt ot his net win
nings.

THE HOUR OF MIDNIGHT
And the Music in the Dives
Will Not Be
Hushed.
St. George's Club Denied the Privi
lege so Box in
Public.
Two weeks ago the Grand Jury fancied
that the moral atmosphere of San Fran
cisco would be purified if the dives were
closed at midnight. In order to effect the
closing an ordinance was recommended
directing that music should cease at mid
night in all dancehalls, saloons and other
establishments where liquor, was sold.
The ordinance was drawn with particular
care by the experts in District Attorney
Barnes' office, and was warranted to shut
off at midnight the music in the most
lascivious dives on the Barbary Coast. In
due time the order was transmitted to
the Board or Supervisors, introduced there
in proper form and referred to the Health
and Police Committee, Mr. Benjamin
chairman. :
Yesterday Supervisor Benjamin re
ceived a communication from the mana
gers of the Orpbeum, in which it was
shown that the ordinance might reach
high classes of evening amusement, and
its adoption would interfere with the Or
pheum and other places which highly re
spectable people patronize. The members
of the committee, after due reflection, de
cided to recommend the indefinite post
ponement of the order.
This ordinance was the particular pet
measure of E. E. Cheever, a Grand Army
man of the Grand Jury, and the fact that
it receives its death blow from Supervisor
Benjamin, a Grand Army man in the
Board of Supervisors, tends to excite ap
prehension of another war equal in inten
sity to the Lyon Post struggle.
The Health and Police Committee yes
terday decided to deny the request of the
St. George Club to hold an athletic and
boxing tournament at the Pavilion on or
about July 27. It is possible that the Si.
George promoters of boxing may get a
chance to show at a later date than that
mentioned, but now the committee re
gards it best to allow the National and
New Occidental clubs to have an inning.

HEROES AND OLD GLORY
Many Attractive Combinations
in Flags and Bunt
ing.
THE TOWN'S METAMORPHOSIS.
Leading Firms Assist Nobly in Deck
ing the City in Holiday
Attire.
The decorations on the store fronts of
the leading mercantile firms on Thursday
were but an earnest of what would be
done in that line on the National holiday.
The few buntings and flags that yesterday
morning flapped in the wind have been
multiplied infinitely, and now Market and
Kearny streets present an appearance of
tri-colored finery seldom excelled.
Raphaels have spared no effort in mak
ing the front of their building aB attract
ive in a patriotic sense as the ingenuity of
their decorative artists conld devise. The
three flag-poles on the top of the building
are laden with square and triangular "Old
Glories." Across the facade of the build
ine red, white and blue bunting is
stretched, and on this are placed pictures
of Revolutionary heroes. Pendants over
the entrance nang and form three flags,
while streamers flutter from all parts of
the front.
Sloane has arranged the carpets in his
windows so that the red, white and blue
appear first to the eye, and has decorated
the doorway with bunting, Burmounted
by the National shield.
The Call business office has, by the
abundance of its decorations, given the
keynote to the patriotic principles of the
paper whose commercial department it
represents. The scaffoldine that did such
c-fiicient servico during the recent Repub
lican Convention was left standing that it
mieht be further honored in assisting to
celebrate the natal day of the Nation.
The screen that bore the first news of the
future President's nomination n"W bears
on a tricolor background the Declaration
of Independence, the document that made
the Presidential candidates of this coun
try possible.
Davis Brothers have concentrated their
decorations to the entrance of their store.
A large circle inclosing a star in which
is a portrait of Washington is above the
door, while on either side the tricolor
bunting is draped.
The City of Paris has combined the
colors of France and America artistically.
Above the Geary-street entrance is a
shield bearing the motto, "Liberte, Eqnal
ite, Fraieruite"' 1
Noiaa Brothers have placed velvet
slippers in their windows of the three
colors and have arranged streamers with
pretty effect.
Summerfield has confined himself to the
Btars and stripes and Sanborn <fe Vail
have decorated a window with beautiful
effect containing the famous pictures that
bear on the warlike scenes that have made
the history of this country.
J. J. O'Brien & Co. s large store is re
6t>lendant with flag-bunting and the pic
tures of America's martial heroes. New
man & Levison and Roos Bros, have used
bunting with good effect and the Wonder
millinery store has charmingly fixed up
its windows with patriotically dressed
forms and tastefully arranged tricolor
ribbons. The Chicago Clothing Co. has
covered its store with flags and bunting.
In readjusting the formation last even
ing an addition was made to the advance
division asiollows:
Battalion from United States ship
Charleston, Lieutenant White, TJ. S. N.,
commanding; Adjutant Lieutenant Wil
liams, U. S. N. ; first company marines,
Lieutenant Newman commanding; sec
ond company, Lieutenant Slmms com
manding; third company, Lieutenant
McDonald commanding.
Walter H. Woods was added to the list
of chief aids and L. G. Schroeder to grand
marshal's aids.
To the fifth division the Supervisors in
carriages were assigned a place.
To the ninth division was added a float â
wire cable from California Wire Works,
drawn by fifty horses.
A POSTHUMOUS HONOR.
The Late A. Page Brown Awarded Em-
inence for His Work.
Official advices have just been received
here that among Californians who received
awards at the World's Fair in 1893 was the
late A. Page Brown of this City, the archi
tect who designed the California State
building and who supervised its construc
tion at Chicago. At the* time this building
was generally regarded as the most unique
and attractive of any of the State build
ings, and this fact is now emphasized by
the receipt of a medal and diploma

Enlisted.
UP -TO - DATE DESIGNS.
Five Thousand Copies Sent On
to Washington to Do
Missionary Work.
OTHER LITERATURE IS SENT.
The Big Convention Will Be Held on
the Bthâ California's Strong
Claim.
As handsome a bit of poster- work as has
ever been produced in the United States,
and one replete with artistic merit, poetic
imagery and historic significance, is that
designed as campaign literature at Wash
ington, D. C, to aid in the work of secur
ing the Christian Endeavor C onvention of
1897 for Ban Francisco.
It is entirely the work of local talent
and enterprise, not the least remarkable
feature of its production being the fact
that it was first thought of a week ago.
Within this brief time the design was con
cqjved, the drawings made, the plntes
etched, the printing, which comprised
three-color runs through the press, was
completed, and while the ink was still wet
the 5000 copies were carefully packed and
shipped.
This expedition was necessary in order
to have them arrive in time to be properly
distributed . They were shipped yesterday
evening and the session of the "Christian
Endeavor Convention will open at Wash
ington on the Bth instant.
With these were also shipped 50,000
handsomely-printed pamphlets of thirty
two pages each, containing interesting in
formation relative to the attractions of the
Golden State.
The folders, pamphlets and about thirty
five cases of other literature depicting
California's manifold charms were the
contributions of the Southern Pacific Com
pany to the local Christian Endeavor com
mittee which has in charge the work of
securing the 1897 convention for this City.
Three tents, with an aggregate seating
capacity of 46,000 people, will De occupied
by the convention delegates and these ele
gant poster* will be hung in the tents, in
1 hotels, churches and places where dele
gates are apt to gather.
The 50,000 paniphiels will be distributed
to the delegates when they are handed the
official programme, so that no field will lie
left uncultivated that may contribute to
victory for San Francisco.
In the poster is shown the first sys
tematic Christian Endeavor on the Pacific
Coast, viz.: the Carmel Mission, then Cal
ifornia is represented by a bear, the Cali
fornia poppy in its natural hue, and the
setting sun. The coloring is bold and
brilliant, and is a combination of but three
hues, red, blue and yellow.
The drawing is the work of Artist Bull
of the Sunset Puoto and Engraving Com
pany.
Attention is called by a few quoted lines
to the historic fact that the cross was s-een
in Monterey nearly a ?cort- of years before
the landing of the Pilgrim "Fathers on
Plymouth Rock. It w;Â»s carred by the
Spanish soldiers, wijo had invaded Alta

SCATHING WORDS
FOR HARMON.
The Attorney -General Is j
Charged With Inter
ested Supineness.
STONE AND HIS PASS.
Attention Again Pointedly Called
to the Failure to Prose
cute Huntington.
SOME NEW EVIDENCE OUTLINED
District Attorney Foote and the
President A!so C me Under the
Lash of Invective.
Oae of the boldest and most scathing
communications ever addressed to a
Cabinet onicer of the United States is that
forwarded by George W. Monteith yester
day to Attorney-General Judsou Harmon.
It not only takes to task the official
addressed, but his local representative,
United States District Attorney H. S.
Foote, C. P. Huntington and the Presi
dent of the United States. The letter fol
lows in full and explains itself:
Ban Francisco, Cal., July 3, 1896.
Hon. Jxidson Harmon, Attorney-General of
United States, Washington, V. Câ MY Dear Sir:
Some six months have now intervened since I
addressed you upon the subject of the case of
ColtiÃ P. Huntington, charged with the com
mission of a crime against the laws of the
United States. My letter at that lime was
written for the purpose of urging you to em
ploy special counsel 10 take charge of the case
because the United States District Attorney
here would not do his duty in the premises.
This appeal was made to you upon the theory
that you would, as an honorable man and an
efficient onicer of the Government, exercise
your authority toward securing an honest
prosecution of a criminal whose crime was so .
strongiy apparent.
Under recent action of Congress your office
controls the prosecuting arm of the Govern
ment, and you are, therefore, responsible ner
sonally in matters of this kind when it is
once cal'ed to your attention.
The utter failure of the Government of the
United States to prosecute this man, who has
for years openly and contemptuously disre
garded the law, is as scandalous as it is dis
graceful and it is certainly high time some
thing was done. The irreimgible evidence of
this man's guilt is in the possession of your
department. He has boldly stated in the pub
lic press that he "did not care a tuppence"
about the case, and it begins to look as though
his confidence in the determination of the
Government not to prosecute the case is well
founded.
You must bear in mind, sir, that the main
evidence in this case was all sworn testimony,
produced in a court of justice in the actual
trial of a case at a time when your department
was moving heaven and earth to convict two
poor strikers under a law Intended to reach
trusts and monopolies, and there is, therefore,
no excuse for this miscarriage of justice.
The Judge of the United States District
Court, himself brought this matter to the at
tention of the Grand Jury, and his good work
in that direction has been nullified by the
nolle prosequi of your representative in this '
City. It is true that the United States court in
New York has held the indictment defective
in failing to show any use of the pass, but it is
also true that the actual use of the pass on au
interstate trip way actually shown in evidence
in the strikers' case, which has made it the
duty of your department to frame a new in
dictment; and, more than that, we have se
cured evidence of two other actual uses of the
pass, which was stated to you in my former
letter.
In reply to my former letter you answered
me with the suggestion that I was rather
hasty in speaking as I did to one who was a
stranger to me personally. You will please
bear in mind that my correspondence with
you is wholly impersonal, and that I am treat
ing you simply in your official and not in your
private capacity, that I urn simply endeavor
ing to see that justice may be done. If you are
derelict in the performance of your duties 1
shall not hesitate to siiy so, because 1 have the
right of a citizen to insist upon your doing
your duty, and that I certainly do and shall
continue to do a* far as the circumstances of
the case render it essential.
I am one of those who believe that the Gov
ernment should deal fairly and justly without
regard to the condition of the man's pocket
book. The present administration has shown
itself only too willing to prosecute poor men
upon partisan, ex parte and unverified state
ments of interested parties, and it seems to me ;
that it ought to be equally prompt to act in
the plain case of tnis mnu Huntin&rton, particu
larly when it involves the commission of one
of the least of the crimes with which he has
been publicly cnarged.
On the other hand the administration con
sumo five months and spends .$30, 000 in try
ing to show that a simple disngreement be
tween workingmen and their employer was
the kind ot conspiracy that Congress meant to
punish when the trust and monopoly act of
181)0 was passed, and yet when the interstate
commerce laws are boldly, even contemptu
ously, violated by a wealthy rogue who has
.systematically and persistently robbed the
people and the Government out of millions
upon millions, you will not even go to the
small expense of employingspecial counsel to
prosecute him in the case where your own
representatives%viU not act; and. indeed, you
go still further and will not permit any other
counsel, even without expense to the Gov
ernment, in the way of compensation, t 0
prosecute a man for the commission of the
crime, the evidence of which has been given
in open court, and has, by the Judge of that
court, been judicially declared sufficient to
warrant indictment and prosecution.
There is no escape from the logic of the
situation. There is no excuse that can be of
feredeven in mitigation of the measure of just
censure that should be visited upon the heaa
of the man who is responsible" for such dis
graceful unwillingness and inactivity. Were
Congress to do its duty, the officers who thus
stand between this criminal and his just
desserts would be promptly impeached.
In your answer to my former letter you told
me you would write the District Attorney and
have the matter attended to. And what has
I been the result? I have waited for six months
and yet not only has nothing been done, but
the Federal authorities of this part of the
world seem to regard the whole matter as a
piece of ancient history, wholly unnecessary
to further consider.
Your efforts with the District Attorney here
have certainly borne but little fruit, and it
may be well for me to call your attention to
whnt lias been done.
After the District Attorney received your in
structions, whatever they were, lie made no
effort to see me or to get hola of the evidence
concerning the two other uses of the ps.ss that
yourattention was drawn to; he simply sought
out Mr. Stone and, as 1 was informe<t,"sceured
from him a statement to the effect that Stone
had not used the pass in question the two trips
referred to but had securea trip pÂ«Â«ses from the
late A. X. Towne, who, being now deceased,
could not be prosecutedâ this, too, in view of
the fact mat Mr. Stone swore in open court
that he had received these annum passe* regu
larly and continuously for ten years as the per
sonal favor of C. P. Huntington. He also testi
fied befoie the Grand Jury that he received
this pass about the 10th of January. All of
this testimony he gave, by the way, at the time
when Mr. Towne was inconveniently alive and
subject to prosecution. In addition to this,
you must reeollec' that the conductors' rec
ords show conclusively that the pass was an
annual pass that was issued by C. P. Hunting
ton. Your department you will see, with all
these facts plainly before it, accepted these un
unveriflcd statements of Stone as against his
former sworn testimony and the other evi
dence of the case to which I referred you to.
But even assuming that Stone's last state
ment swore true, it would not relieve Mr.
Huntington from liability. As you are well
aware, not only would Mr. Towne. if he gave
the pass, be personally liable, but his act in
that case would be the net of his corporation,
the Southern Pacific Company of Kentucky,
which would then be criminally responsible,
and under the decisions of the "United States
courts the directors are the persons upon
whom the punishment is visited, when the
corpo ratio;, is the criminal. So that if Mr.
Stone's Jast statement be true, you would not
only be able to bag Mr. Huntin'gton, but you
would also be able to reach the other eight
Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria.
directors, as well as impose a heavy fine upon
the corporation, all 01 which you have neg
lected to do.
In your redy to my letter, in speaking of
Mr. Foote's action in intervening in the Rail
road Commission case, you stated that it has
been done without authority, and that you
1 would look into it. But I notice your looking
i into lid ia not stop District Attorney Foole's
strange proceedings, which accrue only to
1 the benefit of the railroad company, and was
I in no wise in tne interest of either the people
: or the Government. The asserted theory of
the intervention was that the Government se
! curity would be jeopardized by the grain
I rates being cut down so that the larmers could
j make a little more upon their wheat; and
does it not seem strauge that the Department
01 Justice has only recently waked up to
the fact that the Government had a security
in that quarter ihat was susceptible of injury?
During the thirty years the Southern Pacific
has existed in its various forms the Govern
ment has been apparently wholly indifferent
to what was going on, and its officers have un
hesitatingly alioued the railroad highbinders
j to despoil the Central Pacific of almo>t every
thing it had of any value, or which womb
accrue to tiie Government by way 01 security.
Indeed, the sworn officers of the Government
have sat by supinely ana never before made
even the slightest effort to protect the secur
ity of the Government.
Indeed this gives much color to Mr. Hunt
ington's statement that he '"did not care a tup
pence," for he has learned by long experience
to have so little iear of the Federal Go^rn
ment or its laws thai the very idea of nnj ' .<e
having the audacity to seek to have nim
punished for a crime was so maniiestiy absurd
that he had no reason to "care a tuppence."
But I am not disposed to charge your depart
ment with being wholly idle, or being subject
to perennial ennui. A matter came up last
winter which shows that your department is
not wholly deficient in finding means to pro
secute people when there is sufficient incen
tive. I only wish to draw your attention to
the "hot sto\ - e" incident, which grew out of
the splendid fight the Honorable Mayor of San
Francisco has been making to prevent these
railroad bandits from retaining the plunder
that they have wrongfully obtained. In the
course of that fight I believe Mayor Sutro
mailed to the different members of the House
an innocent little cartoon labeled '-C. P.
Huntin>iton would not 6teal a red-hot stove."
This was too much. The vials of Govern
ment wrath at once opened and the tnuuders
of official indignation were aroused until a
veritable cyolone was created. You took the
matter up, I am informed," and gravely de
cided that the laws of the United States hud
been violated, just as your predecessor did
when a couple of overgÂ»own boys let the steam
out of a locomotive and declared it a con
spiracy. The matter was held to be clearly
libelous, and because libelous unmailable,
and having been mailed was a violation of the
statute. The District Attorney uere did not
hesitate to declare that Mayor Sutro should be
punished; that the fact thnt he was wealthy
made no difference; that he proposed to do his
duty in the premises, "Fiat justicia mat
cselum," and the Government building was
shaken to its very foundation. Such a flagrant
violation of the laws must be punished. The
very idea that any man could so libel the lar
cenous instincts or abilities of Collis P. Hunt
ington or even intimate that he would leave a
stove, and a red-hot one at that, unscathed, was
too much.
It was the last straw that broke the camel's
back. To think that the Mayor of San Fran
cisco had the audacity to intimate that he
would stop at a stove, and a red-hot one at
i that, was not to be tolerated for a moment.
The man should be prosecuted! he should
be punished! he ought to be hanged for treason!
He had openly proclaimed thai Mr. Hunting
ton had bribed Congressmen and nothing was
said; but when he intimated that this old
reprobate was so losing his faculties that he
wouid stop at red-hot stoves, aa insult had
been inflicted that required all the avenging
powers of the American Department of Justice
to resent 1
Thus we have the great record of your de
partment in this behali. A couple of strikers,
without injury to the locomotive, let off the
steam and drew the fire, and they were charged
with conspiracy under the laws that had been
intended, Dut which proved ineffectual, to
reach the trusts and monopolies, and are made
to stand five months' trial at heavy expense.
The Mayor of San Francisco is threatened
with prosecution for simply intimating that
this man Huntington had not enough larcen
ous Inclination or ability to enable him to ab
stract a red-hot stove.
On the other hand the great monopoly that
has wrecked and ruined the Jhappiness and
prosperity of a whole State with 1,250,000
inhabitants is allowed \o obtain the active as
sistance of your department, and when the
people of that commonwealth are endeavoring
to secure some relief from the exactions of
their corporate oppressor in the reduction of
their freights, your department comes in just
at the moment most calculated to aid the
monopoly and to injure the people. You have
one kind of law for the rich and another for
the poor. When the corporation claims that
its rights are infringed, your department
comes promptly to its rescue. When the peo
ple cry out that the same monopoly have
robbed the Government, you sit still and do
nothing. When the great corporation tries to
grind its workingmen and they refuse to sub
mit, you come to the former's assistance with
injunctions and prosecutions. You call out
the regular army Rnd shoot men down. You
aid their oppressors to prosecute them. You
convict them long before you have beard the
evidence.
But when the "interests" of the great cor
poration are involved somehow your depart
ment is never able to find any way to either
determine their guilt or secure their punish
ment. Therefore what is the use of telling you
to do your duty ; you have not done it and do
not intend to do 1:. The only thing left to do
is to secure your impeachment, and that, no
matter how plain the case might be, would
with this Congress be a futile effort. The
f>resent Congress and administration all float
n the same boat. Whether your master, the
great American Belshazzar, as he now sits at
his last feast, has or has not read the hand
writing <>n the wall, 1 know not. But it is
there, and you all ha ire boon weighed and been
found wanting, and if I mistake not when
come the i<les of November the great American
people will voice their terrible indignation at
the scandals of the last four years in a manner
that will leave no uncertainty, even in the
minds of those whose thick hiaes seem most
impervious to the cry of misery that results
from the most damnable misrule that ever dis-
I graced civilization. Respectfully yoms,
GEORCiK \V. MoNIEITH.
CELEBRATE THEIR RELEASE
Two Vagrant Women Badly Cut
an Inoffensive Vegetable-
Peddler.
They Were Joined in Their Orgie of
Blood and Beer by James
Smith.
Mary Rowe and Mary Morgan, two
women who were sent to the County Jail for
vagrancy thirty days ago, were liberated
yesterday morning and started in to cele
brate the event. They were joined in their
spree by James Smith, an ex-guard at the
prison.
As they marched down San Jose road
they encountered an Italian vegetable ven
dor driving his wagon and assaulted him
j with rocks.
The Rowe woman climbed up on the
front wheel and tried to drag the driveroff
his seat. When he resisted she drew a
knife and slashed his left arm.
The frightened peddler jumped off ant
ran for his life.
He reported the case to Captain Gillen
at the Seventeenth-street station and Offi
cers Fitzgerald, Biackman and Edner were
sent out.
In the meantime, before the trio could
be reached, Mary Rowe plunged her knife
several times into one of the horses at
tached, to the wagon.
Subsequently, Smith and the two women
tried to take charge of the New York
Dairy, where they met their match. The
workmen there beat Smith quite severely
and gave Mary Rowe a whipping likewise.
The policemen took the three hilarious
beings into custody and, charged Mary
Rowe with assault witti a deadly weapon.
Mary Morgan and James Smith were
charged with drunkenness and disturbing
the peace.

with the broad and significant assertion
that Flint & Co. were large sbip-owners,
had plenty of vessels at present at their
immediate disposal and would put on as
many vessels as the demands of the busi
ness mieht require.
That this new enterprise should be es
tablished at this time has occasioned much
comment and speculation. Never before
in the history of the transportation world
have rates between the Pacific and Atlan
tic seaboards been so low, and shipments
at this season of the year are always at
their minimum.
From a gentleman well informed on the
local as well as the general shipping situa
tion a palpable reason for the entry of the
Flint line at the present time was ob
tained. The rate on keroseue oil to Japan
has recently advanced from 12 to 18 cents
per case, and this increase of 50 per cent
on the freight of this kind of cargo has
drawn many vessels into that trailic that
had formerly kept cut of it. Another fact
that bad diminished the available tonnago
between New York and San Francisco 13
the chartering of about fifteen vessels by
J. D. Spreckels & Co. for moving tne sugar
crop from the Hawaiian Islands.
This unusual tax on the ordinary sail
mc tonnage has opened the route around
the Horn for the newcomers, it is argued,
with a chance ior them to get a large
share of business â much more than they
would have been able to secure under
normal circumstances.
It is admitted that there is not much
money, if any, in carrying freight around
the Southern American contineut for 30
cents per 100 pounds or $6 per ton, as is
now done by the sailing vessels, and even
on the Panama ronte for Eust-bound
freight, but on the other hand it is argued
that Flint & Co. see a more promising
future ahead, and are simply utilizing the
present opportunity to get a grip on the
situation.
Every transportation influence is now at
work seeking io bring about an advance in
rates, and the indications, among railroad
men and shippers, are said to point to a
near consummation of this object. With
it will naturally come better remuneration
also for the Cape Horn carriers, even
though they should not enjoy the advan
tage of a subsidy from the rail lines, as
will be the case with the Pacific Mail*
Panama combination.
But whatever the cause and whatever
the motive, the advent of the Flint line is
viewed as a good thing. If it shouid serve
no other purpose than to keep transconti
nental rates within a reasonable limit,
the merchants deem it to be entitled to
their support.
