OAKLAND, Cal., Sept. I.â This after
noon grief was hurled into four happy
families at Pinole. James McNulty, W.
W. Crater, Manuel Garcia Mor'irzo and
John Freitas went to their work in the
early morning and in the afternoon their
disfigured bodi- s lay side by side in the
acid-bouse that for many successive years
has done duty at the California Powder
Works as a morgue.
In another part of the big charnel-house,
in small boxes, were the remains of eight
Chinamen. Around them a small group
of their countrymen were chattering,
though whether their excitement was due
to grief or congratulation over their own
fate no white man can judge.
A tongue of dame had shot into the air
about an hour after noon. Bright as was
the sun it was not bright enough to
eclipse the view of toe curling fixe from
being seen for miles around.
A few seconds after the flash there was
a long, low rumbling sound that shook the
earth, and again, after the lapse of a few
seconds, there was another flash and an
other sound like distant thunder. Under
ordinary circumstances it would be
thought that a summer slorm was pass
ing over the Berkeley hills. But the
wives and mothers who live near Pinole
Point know by sad experience just what
such artificial lightning and thunder mean.
They rush at once to the gate and uown
the dusty road to learn who is left father
less and what homes are bereft of the
bread-winner.
A dozen men were at work in the nitro
glycerine house. They had just returned
from their mia-day meal and were going
about their dangerous duties, though
with no thought of danger to themselves.
With a confidence, the result of being ac
customed to handle deadly material, they
passed ttjeir jokes and carried on their
conversation wiih as much apparent care
lessness as though they were at a picnic.
Suddenly there was a shout.
One of the most experienced men
thought he saw something unnatural
hovering over a bucket of the deadly acid.
He looked again and experience told him
instantly that he and his fellow workmen
were on the verge of eternity. He did not
let a moment pass, but rushing to the
doors he yelled, "Follow me boys, she's
going."
Men in powder factories do not cry
"Wolf" when there is no wild beast in
sight, and the companions of Gus Shreider,
who made the discovery, did not hesitate
or "reason why." They flew, and as they
flew they shouted.
They had gone about a thousand feet
when there was a flash of lightning, in
stantly followed by a deafening crashing
louder than any thunder. The ground
trembled beneath them, and those who
were not thrown down quickly sought a
prostrate position as the safest way to
avoid the flying missies.
Any one observing them would have
thought that they were killed, as not one
moved. Not so, however. There was a
method in their act. They knew that
their late workshop was connected with
another deadly placeâ the m;xine-house
with a pipe through which the ignited
acid would surely travel at fearful speed.
When the flames should reach the mix
ing-house, then â
But before they had time to think their
fear was realized, another flash came;
which they did not see, as their faces were
on the ground. They heard the harrow
ing explosion and crash that followed, and
then they arose, and a little later were
working hard with others in subduing the
fires kmd.ed by the two explosions.
Although the men in the nitro-glycerine
house escaped uninjured, far different was
the fate of the poor f Hows who were in
the mixing-house. Eight Chinamen, who
wer<. at work in the house. James Mc-
Nulty, the foreman of the glycerine-house,
and W. W. Crater, who was in the fatal
territory, were sacrificed instantly. Very
hard was the fate of McNulty. His work
was with the men who escaped, and bad
he not just made a call at the mixing
house he would in all human probability
have still been alive.
Manuel Garc a Mortirzo and John
Freitas were working in a car that was on
a railroad track on the bank above the
mxin^-iiouse. Whether or not they tried
to save tiiemseives aiter the first explosion
Will never be known, but their dead bodies
were picked up about twenty feet from the
track in such condition that nobody but
their intimate acquaintances would know
thf-m.
Wien the fact was realized that there
was no danger ol any further explosions

YESTERDAY AFTERNOON.
confidence returned, and the more fortu
nate employes under Superintendent Pol
lock commenced to subdue the flames.
The explosion set fire to the ruins of the
mixing-house and over a hundred acres
of tall grass was soon ablaze.
The men seemed to have a task in hand
greater than they could accomplish. The
burning building was soon subdued, but
blazing grass around a powder factory is
ominous, and while some men worked
with hoses and sacks others searched for
the missing bodies.
Considerable doubt and as much anxiety
existed fora time as to who had fa len
victims and who were left. There was a
rollcall of the living and then a search for
the missing.
As soon as the battle against the flames
had fairly commenced help came from an
unexpected source. The United States
vessel Gedney is lying at anchor off
Pinoie Point, and while the powder-works
employes were wishing for assistance a
boat was landed at the pier from the war
ship and fifty of Uncle Sam's sailors
rushed to the relief of the hard-working
fire- fighters.
The increased force soon bad the flames
under control and before 5 o'clock they
returned to .heir floating home after
having accomplished some heroic work.
When the flames were put out everybody
searched for the missing bodies.
The first one foand was that of James
McNulty, who had been thrown a short
distance down the bank. He had evi
dently been killed instantly and on his
body were enough marks of violence to
have caused death many times. McNulty
was for seven years a deputy in the County
Clerk's office in San Diego. He was a
single man, about 40 years old.
Near the bulkhead which formed one
side of the mixing-house the remains of
W. W. Crater were found. He was fore
man of the packing-house, which was also
totally wrecked. He resided in Oakland
and was a bright young fellow, about 30
years of age.
Crater's death brings gloom to two
households. In a short time it is believed
that he was to have led a very worthy
young woman to the altar, but now pros
pective joy has been blasted by cruel
mourning. Some distance above the little
railroad track on which nitre is trans
ported from its storehouse to tbe mixing
room were found the bodies of M. Garcia
Mortirzo and John Freitas. Garcia was
an assistant engineer and single, but
Freitas was several years older and is the
father of eight children.
While the white employes were engaged
in the task of finding their dead, the
Chinese were hunting for their country
men. The remains in many instances
were so charred and blackened that it was
impossible to determine whether they
were white or Chinese.
When they were gathered in the dark, \
damp niter-bouse, which is sunk into the
side of a hill, tbe Chinese did not follow
their usual custom of setting up a paper
joss and of lighting a number of punks. I
They explained this by saying that they
were not certain that some of the remains
were not those of white men, and under no i
circumstances would they invoke the joss
when such doubt existed.
A walk over the smoking ruins gayÂ«
ample evidence of the awful and unreli
able results of a nitro-glycerine explosion.
The small group of eucalyptus trees
growing to the west of the mixing-house,
which have just had time to grow green
since the explosion of last year, were
stripped of every leaf ano small twig, but
not a single trunk was either broken or
laid low, while fences 200 yards away were
transformed into tiny splinters.
The force that blew up tons of earth at
the foot of a big log spared it and a little
insulator fastened to it with a small screw
was also left unharmed. Two of the men,
Freitas and Mortirzo, were working on a
small car just above the mixing-house and
both men and the horse used for pulling
it were blown partly up the bank and torn
to pieces. The car is still on the track but
is burned and does not appear to have
felt in the smallest degree the awful force
of the explosion. To the west of the mix
ing-house where all the lives were lost is
the packing-house, which is a total wreck,
the blast seeming to have fairly gone
through the center of it.
In the grove of trees referred to among
the wee bits of leaves was a generous cov
ering of splintered wo .d and small parti
cles of glass glistening like diamonds
which had come many yards from the
frames where a few minutes previously
they had done duty as windows.
It was in this forlorn-looking place that
a Chinaman was seen with a small box
under one arm and a stick in his rif;ht
hand, intently searching for something.
"What are you looking for, John?" he was
asked. In a sullen tone he replied
"Pieces," and in his box v.ere black, iroryj
unrecognizable remains of human bodies.
Emerging from the trees a man was mot
with a human foot in his hand walking

along with no unpleasant expression on
his face, but rather a proud look that he
had such keen sicht.
Hers was a mass covered with blood.
"Was H apiece?" No; only clay which
marked tbe spot where tbe body of a man
had just been found.
The carpenter-shop was an untidy sight
An old carpenter would have turned sick
to see the ruthless way in which the tools
bad been scattered about. T c walls
leaned in different directions ana parts of
the machinery of the planing-mill, which
is in the same building, hung helplessly
from the battered ceiling.
The chemist sat in the laboratory with
bis chair tilted back a* a comfortable
angle with his head leaning against the
window pane â suddenly the glass formed
itself to the shape of his head in quick
style while there was a glittering shower
all about him.
With a terrible expression of fright in
his eyes he rushed out for assistance,
thinking he was badly cut, but upon in
spection was found to be without a
scratch. When he told of his experience
to a reporter be said that he fully expected
to find his head resembling a church
window. On the east side of the mixing
house was a strong bulkhead which acted
as the wall for that side. It is still stand
ing there almost as firm as it was before
the explosion, while buildings a hundred
yards from it were completely shattered.
The former site of the mixing-house
presented a desolate appearance. The
ground was torn up, and mixed with it
were splinters, chemicals, pieces of human
bodies, sacks, and occasionally pieceÃ of
Chinamen's clothing. Above and to both
sides are tall bare limbs of trees, between
whicli can be seen the wrecks of buildings
near by.
And all this desolation was brought
about in the brief period of a few seconds.
The damage caused by the explosion
while naturally great is decidedly small
when compared with the fearlul catastro
phes that are periodically experienced in
tbe various powiier works along the shore
at FlemmingÃ Point and Pinole.
Scene at the California Powder Works as Viewed From the Deck of the Spreckels Tug Fearless. At
the Moment of the Explosion Chief Engineer Lennis Was Looking Oat of the Engine-Room,
and the Accompanying Picture Is From a Sketch Made by Kirn.
It has long been noticed thatjtbe effect
of nitro-glycerine when exploded is ter
ribly disastrous in the immediate locality
of the explosion, but that its force is not
far-reaching. The accident ot to-day is no
exception.
The nitro-glycerine house, the packing
house, the mixing-house, the carpenter
shop and planinc-mill were badly wrecked,
but several buildings that were in what
might be called the track of the explosion
escaped without injury.
The packing-house presents a peculiar
sight. It looks as though a cyclone had
passed clean through the middle of it.
The roof in quite close to the founda
tion, but the middle is gutted and torn
asunder m a manner that clearly indicates
the force of the explosion.
Beveral buildings are only shaken, and,
although no one can tell exactly what is
the total damage, one of the old employes
said that $10,000 would go a long way
toward enabling the works to start up.
The California Powder Works employ
about 110 men, of whom eighty are
whites. The value of tbe buildings alone
is stated by the officials of the company
to be about $6000.
There, was no need to look for wounded,
for experience has taught the men only
too well that if there is no answer to the
rollcall no hope need be entertained of
finding any of their comrades wounded in
the debris. A cut finger and bruised spot
or two usually constitute the only
"wounds."
A workman looking for pieces of his fel
low workmen was asked what they did
with the wounded. "Wounded I" said he,
looking up surprised, "we don't have any
wounded."
Th s afternoon as the clear stars and
stripes floated out against the smoky back
ground a man walked briskly past, but he
did not fail to notice it. He looked aloft
and then quickened his steps toward
home. He walked at such a lively gait
that he was able to keep up with the
somewhat tired horses that were return
ing after taking a party to the scene of the
explosion.
As be approached a little red cottage on
the left-hand side of the road a pleasant
looking young woman rushed to the gate
to meet him, followed by a pretty little
tot about 2 years old.
His face was blackened and so were his
clothes and bands, but happiness and
thankfulness pierce deeper tnan the sur
face, and the earnestness of the embrace
needed no interpretation.
It called to my mind the remark made
by one of the men who was helping to
find the bodies in the ruins. "Well,
John," he said, "it may be our turn next."
And it is this feartul uncertainty that is
daily borne by the wives and mothers at
Pinole.
The following complete account of the
four white men who lost their lives was col
lected:
Winneld S. Crater, foreman of the packing
house, 32 years of age, single, a native of New
Jersey, and one of the most experienced pow
der-makers in the country, having served in
various branches of the business Irom boy
hood. His parents live at Succasunna, near
Lake Hopatcong, N. J. A brother is employed
In the Union Iron Works in this City. Crater
was considered an invaluable man at the
works and was very popular.
John McNulty, foreman of the mixing-house,
37 yecrs of age, single, a native of Massachu
setts, and an employe oi the works since the
last explosion fourteen months ago. He was
formerly a resident of San Diego, where he
was a man of some prominence in a political
way. At one time he \va3 Deputy County
Surveyor and at another Deputy County Clerk
at San Diego. He was also journal clerk in the
State Senate during one or two sessions.
John Freitas, carman, 47 years of ace, mar
ried and the father of several children, a Por
tugue-e-Americau, resident of Pinole, and an
employe of the works for the last eight or ten
years. One of his sons is also employed in the
works.
Manuel Garcia Mortirzo, carman, 55 years of
age, married and the father of severa. children,
native of Portugal ana an employe at the
works for the last five years. He lives in
Pinole with his family and one of his sons had
employment with his father.
Superintendent Alexander Pollock,
speaking of the probable loss, said:
It is impossible even to estimate the finan
cial loss. Say $25,000 and you will not be far
off. The damage inciudes <he value of the
buildings destroyed, all the minor damages to
Qutlying buildings, the value of the expen
sive apparatus In the buildings and the loss in
business trorn the delay.
However, I think we shall be running again
in two weeks. The buildings cost about $4000.
The nitro-glyceiine house was a new plant
erected since the last explosion.
Probably $1000 worth of stuff was on hand
in the mixing-house when it was torn to bits
and two wnite men and eight Chinamen killed
in it, while Garcia and Freitas, the carmen,
were killed just outside, along with the horse â
best one on the ranch â that was drawing the
car. In the nitro-glycerine house there were
3600 pounds of nitro-glycerine, worth about
$850.
Over 1000 acres of grass was burned, and
even more would have gone ana greater dam
age boeu done had it not been for the skillful
back-firing of Mumsey. As ii was the fire ex
tended way tip as far as Rodeo, and it took
over 100 raea to subdue it.
The men at the Mare Island Nary-yard were
particularly courteous in comine to our assist
ance and in offering medical aid to any that
might be wounded. The survey-boat Gedney
was lying cm in the bay, and she landed part
of her crew in charge of naval lieutenants.
They volunteered at once to help fight fire in
the tlelds.
Then the Thetis came down from the yard â
about five or six miles from here â and her
men landed at 4 o'clock and two launches ar
rived with other volunteers. The yard sur
geon, Heber I think his name is, came with his
assistant, carrying his field chest of medi
cines and oil and bandages, and offered any
assistance possible.
A few of the men had slight injuries from
flying debris and broken glass, but nothing
serious.
Captain John Bermingham, president of
the California Powder Works, which in
cludes the dynamite plant near Pinole,
and the black powder plant near Santa
Cruz, arrived upon the scene early in the
afternoon by special train from the Oak
laud mole. He was accompanied by Jack
Wallace of the main office. Atter viewing
the damage and seeing that everything
had been arranged for the unfortunates,
he returned to this City.

SAN DIEGO, Cal., Sept. I.â The largest
political gathering ever seen in San Diego
was the McKinley audience addressed in
the plaza to-night by Hon. S. M. Short
ridge. There were fully 5000 people pres
ent, large numbers standing in the streets
and lining the pavements in all directions
for fully 1000 feet
The meeting was preceded by a band
concert. The McKinley Club of 800 men
marched with banners and flaes
amid a blaze of fireworks and Grecian
lights. The following vice-presidents oc
cupied the platform, a raised stage beneath
fully an acre of canvas: Simon Levi, S. L.
Ward, Captain James Keith, L. A.
Blochman, Samuel Pine, Chester Gunn,
W. M. Herbert, George Hazzard,
R. E. Chapman, Judge D. L. Murdock, Dr.

Kie, D. L. Withington, George Foster,
Henry G. Crocker.
The meeting was called to order by
Chairman A. G. Nason of the Republican
Central Committee, who introduced Con
gressman W. W. Bowers as president of
the evening. Back of the president sat
Rev. Anna Shaw and Mrs. Anna B. Sloan,
guests of the evening. Congressman
Bowers introduced Mr. Shortridge in a
graceful speech, saying:
"TLis grand rally reminds one of old
times â of the times of Lincoln. I am
glad to preside at such a gathering and to
introduce the distinguished orator of the
evening,"
The speaker dwelt for some time on the
failure of the Cleveland administration,
and said ti.e people were about to banian
the incompetont Democrats from power
forever. At the conclusion of the speech,
Mr. Shortridge arose and said:
"Ladies and gentlemen: l have been
grossly deceived. When I was up among
the fogs of San Francisco bay, 1 was told
that the Republicans south of the Te
bachapi were apathetic If so, I wish
there were more of such apathy through
out the State. This audience indicates in
language more eloquent than can fall
from my lips that you of San Diego are
resolved to do all you can to elect every
man on the ticket, from the lowest candi
date up to the matchless and incompara
ble statesman, William McKinley."
The mention of McKinley's name was
the signal for such applause as has seldom
been heard at a political meeting here.
Continuing, the speaker said:
"I come here in the spirit of the old
Roman, who held to the maxim that
every man ought to write on his brow his
thoughts concerning the republic. I
want to speak for the welfare of the coun
try and to address you in the spirit of
fairness and of truth, whether you be
Democrats, Populists or Republicans.
"I do not believe there has ever been a
time when the Republican party needed
the allegiance of its members more than
now, and I beg you to remember that we
are marching under the glorious banner
of Lincoln and of Grant, of Gartield and
of Blame. [Applause.] The banner of that
great party which has made the country
free.
â¢â¢And it is this banner which Major Mc-
Kinley is carrying on to victory to-day.
It is under that flag that Congressman
Bowers [cheers] is marching, and you
know he will stand bravely and help Wil
liam McKinley restore a genuine Ameri
can tariff." [Great applause.!
The speaker pleaded for a judgment on
the Republican party by reason of its
record.
"Judge it," he said, "as you would
judge a man. Its record is gtoiious, and
you are all anxious to see it in power
again. The night of Democratic disaster
is almost over and the glorious morning
of Republicanism is about to dawn again.
We are all anxious to see business re
vived. The past is dead.
"All of its experiences have gone, and its
only value can be to teach us how to gov
ern the future. Judging by the recent
i.ast, I ask you: Where is the man who
wou ! d not rather h .ive the administration
of Harrison than that of Cleveland ? It

there are Democrats who are proud of tbe
past four years I have not seen them."
The speaker then laid down what he
conceived to be the principles of the Re
publican party. "It favcrs free speech
and free I'ande," he said, "and above all is
for a tariff that will revive the slumbering
industries of the country. [Applause.]
The Republican party is to-day the genu
ine party of bimetallism; it favors
gold and* siiver and such legislation
as will Keep them at par, so that
a silver dollar will be wortn 100 cents in
every land where comm'ree is known. At
believes in preserving all forms of the cur
rency of this country at par, so that the
workingmen's silver dollar shall be worth
as much as the banker's gold in the vault.
There is more money in this couutry to
day than there has ever been before, and
the money question is not the cause of our
troubles."
Here some one in the audience in
quired, "Where is all this money ?,'
"I will tell you where it is," replied the
speaker with spirit and amid cheers.
"When the Democrats struct down the
industries of the country by passing the
Wilson bill, they closed the factories,
drove capital out of business, made work
men idle and brought universal bank
ruptcy and despair."
At this point there was prolonged ap
plaase and great cheering. The speaker
then explained how the Democrats, hav
ing failed to conduct the affairs of the
Government on the tariff theory, recently
cast about for a new battle-cry and chose
the silver issue.
"But the people have memories," hÂ«
said, "and I do not believe they will
try the Democratic panacea again.
The people want domestic and foreign
commerce; they want a revival of indus
tries, and, above all, protection against
the cheap laborof foreign lands. [Cheers.]
In California particularly we need a de
velopment of one great industry â the pro
duction of sugar beets â a business that
would in time pive employment to thou
sands and enable this State to furnish
bugar for the entire Union. [Applause.]
"We want such a policy as will open the
factories of the country, and until the in
dustries of workshops and field are revived
It will not help any one to Increase, tbe
money of the country even to billions of
dollars." [Cheers.]
The speaker explained that it was the
stamp of tbe Government that made all
American money i Uerchangeable at par,
and that lie, with his party, believed in
maintaining gold and silver at par. In
this country there were no classes, and
there should" be no sections.
"The Democrats are trying to create
doubt and confusion in the minds of the
people by appealing to tbe envy in our
hearts. This thought I want you to bear
in mind; the thought that we need pro
tection. Bear in mind that the Demo
crats have reaffirmed their free-trade no
tions in their Cnicago platform â tbe same
old party trying to sneak back to power
under a new and false issue. [Applanse.]
"If you are dissatisfied with these laws,
if you are tired of seeing this Nation bor
row money to pay running expenses in
times of profound peace, vote the Demo
cratic party out of power and put bacK tbe
Republicans, who will restore confidence
and bring prosperity to the land aaain."
Throughout the delivery of the speech
there was the greatest imaginable enthu
siasm, and Mr. Shortridge's concluding
remarks moved the audience to prolonged
cheering. In substance he saia:
"Fellow-citizens, you cannot tear down
one section of the country without injur
ing the other; yoii cannot put out the
fires of the furnaces without affecting the
farmer. We must preserve this great
'ountry for our own people. We must
devise ways and means to give employ
ment to our own people, and it is
infinitely better, wiser, it is more patri
otic, to make it a matter of aentimenti to
give employment to the men of New Eng
land and the South and West, and to
California, than it is to start the factories
of England going or open tae mills of
Germany.
"Now, fellow-citizens, I beg to appeal to
the Republicans of this city and county,
and I ask you to remember that the Re
publican party is- worthy of your confi
dence and support now as it has been
in tbe past. [Applause.] I ask you, men
and women, under the banner of ti.e early
lathers, tbe great leaders of the party, to
ftand Crm in this campaign.
"I ask the young men of the Republican
party to remember that they have a brave
and a serious duty to perform, and that
the party of their fathers is worthy of their
allegiance. I ask the thoughtful Demo
crats who are here, who love their State,
who believe in tbe constitution, men
wbo believe in tbfl supremacy of the
law, men who believe in the fa.th
and in the honor of the Na ion,
to stand under the Republican banner. I
ask you to consider the position of the Re
publican party and what it has done; to
consiaer that it is the friend of silver; that
it is the friend of all the currency we have,
and to remember that all of this currency
is at par because of the laws which the
Republican party enacted.
"With our boundless prairies it is a sad
and pathetic thing to know that men are
begging for the poor privilege of toiling
for their daily bread. If a statesman
wants to earn the credit of his country
men he will give honest men a
chance to toil, and William Me-
Kinley is a man to give the people
of this country, under his leadership,
under the principles which he espouses, a
chance to work, and a chance to earn an
honest living. [Applause.] Republicans,
let me ask you to organize; and, if there
be any lack of harmony, to harmonize.
Let me ask you to march shoulder to
shoulder, and march confidently, and lift
the banner high and proudly, because it
is the banner of protection, the banner of
bimetallism, the banner of prosperity, and
the banner which, in the bands of Me-
Kinley, will be lifted higher than all the
banners of the earth, so that if the other
great powers of the world do not love it,
they will learn to respect and to fear it.
[Applause.]
"So, ladies and gentlemen, the case, so
far as lam concerned, is submitted. You
are the jury; you will consider these
things. Others will address you, you will
read, you wi;l think, you will consider,
judge these questions calmly in theliiibt
of experience, and if you do, I have no
doubt that the Republican parly will not
only sweep this county, that you will not
only aid in returning your Congressma \,
Mr. Bowers, and carry your legislative
ticket, bat you will assist us of the north
en rolling up a splendid majority for our
champion, your champion, the Nation's
sharupion, the spotless and incomparable
itatesnian, William McKmley."
At the conclusion of the oration of the
evening, Rev. Anna Shaw made a pleasing
address on woman suffrage. She was
cheered with enthusiasm.
Pythian Knights and Suicides.
CLEVELAND. Ohio, Sept. I.â To-day's
Session of the Supreme Lodge, Knights
of Pythias, was the warmest of
the convention. The report of the
board of control, Uniform Rank,
recommending that suicides be debarred
from all death benefits if death occur
within a period of rive years after joining
the order, aroused a strong opposition. A
compromise was effected whereby the
heirs of suicides will be settled with on the
graduation system of life expectation as
used by the American Board of Under
writers.

BRYAN ATTRACTS
VERY BiG CROWDS,
Fifty Thousand People Turn
Out to Hear Him at
Columbus.
AN OPEN PARK FILLED.
So Vast Is the Throng That the
Candidate Divides a Speech
Into Four Sections.
REPEATS THE USUAL SONG.
S3ys There Is Only One Issue in the
Campaign, and That Is
Cbeap Money.
COLUMBUS,* Ohio, Sept. I.â ln all his
career, wonderful as it has been, and filled
during the past week witn remarkable
demonstrations in his honor, William J.
Bryan never addressed an audience bo
large and so enthusiastic as that gathered
in the State House grounds to-night.
Under the shadow of the big structure
where the Ohio Legislature holds its ses
sions, the Democratic nominee saw before
him a concourse of Major McKinley's fel
low State's people that cannot be com
pared to any political assemblage in the
country, except to the thousands of peo
ple who gather in front of the capitol at
Washington once every four years to hear
a new chief magistrate make his salutatory.
Fancy an open park of ten acres and
nearly every foot of that great space, with
the exception of narrow strips on the
very outskirts, choked with human beings,
each pressed so closely to his fellows that
movement was impossible. The steps of
the Capitol building presented one slant
ing mass of perspiring but patient human
ity, who stood in relief against the
packed and jammed thousands of their fel
lows on the grassy lawn and cemeDted
pathways.
People who have witnessed the inaugu
ration of the Ohio Governors in recent
years say that the crowds on those occa
sions never numbered more than 30,000.
But to-niglit everybody was saying that
the inaugural assemblies did not compare
in point of numbers with the magnificent
congregation that came to hear the young
Democratic candidate on the issues of the
campaign.
As Mr. Bryan himself said, "It filled all
outdoors," and so far beyond the reach of
his voice did the solid human mass ex
tend that Mr. Bryan was obliged to divide
his speech into four segments, one deliv
ered from each side of the canopied stand
that had been erected for the occasion.
Fifty thousand is a conservative estimate
of those who were present. People had
been pouring into Columbus all day from
the surrounding country.
This is the second day of the State Fair,
and that with the additional attraction of
.Bryan's presence filled the city with
strangers. Then a number of political
organizations, to whom tbe fair had no
interest, but whose sote object was to do
honor to the Democratic standard-bearer,
helped swell the crowds in the streets and
to lead in the enthusiasm which was
everywhere prevalent. Two thousand
miners came from the Hocking Valley.
The Newark silver organizations, num
bering 1500, put in an appearance. Two
thousand more, composing silver clubs,
came from Mount Vernon, and places to
the west of Columbus furnished 700. The
railroid companies gave unusually low
rates and thousands of people took advan
tage of them.
Mr. ard Mrs. Bryan reached Columbus
over the Big Four at 3 :30 o'clock this after
noon in a special car chartered by the
members of the Columbus reception com
mittee, who accompanied them from
Cleveland.
The candidate was chetred by thou
sands at the railway station and by thou
sands more along the mile or more of
streets through which he was taken, es
corted by the Franklin County Silver
League, tne Jackson Club and other local
and visiting Bryan and Swall organiza
tions. There was a tremendous jam at
the Chittenden Hotel, where apartments
had been secured lor Bryan and his wife,
but a way was forced through the wildly
excited enthusiasts gathered there in the
hope of getting a look at the Democratic
standard-bearer, and tbe rest of the pro
cession passed on.
Prior to to-night's great demonstration
in front of the State House there was an
other parade, in which of course Mr.
Bryan was the central figure, seated in a
carriage drawn by four white horses. The
local silver clubs and those from other
places in the State, many of them with
bands of music at their heads, marched
behind tbe carriage along streets thronged
with interested and cheering spectators.
A number of buildings were decorated,
the illuminations of the permanent arches
maintained by Columbus business men
here were handsome and the display of
fireworks were extreme fine. By good
police arrangements far better than that
of any city visited by the candidate, a
way was kept clear from the outskirts of
the park to the atand in front of the capi
tol building, and throuen this. Mr. and
Mrs. Bryan and those accompanying them
were enabled to reach the assigned posi
tions with difficulty.
Just before they arrived the stand,
hitherto darkened, burst into a flood of
light, givtn from scores of electric globes
which studded the ribs supporting the
canvas ceiling. The stand was spacious
and accommodated not only a number of
prominent Democrats and their wives, but
tie members of a brass band and the
Democratic Glee Club.
Nearly every person in that stupendous
audience, packed over ten acres of ground,
could see the Democratic candidate as he
mounted the steps of the rostrum and
stood before them. And then the cheer
ing bepan. The initial shouts came from
those who were the first to see tne young
Nebraskan, and then they spread through
the crowd until it seemed that every man
and woman there was testing the capacity
of his or her pulmonary organs. "Bryan,
Bryan, Bryan!" waÂ« the cry, and" the
cheering rose in volume until it reached
the finai limit of enthusiastic potency.
James Ross, chairman of the Franklin
County Democratic Committee, attempted
to call tbe assemblage to order in his ca
pacity as temporary chairman. But the
buzz of voices was so great in volume that
it drowned his words, and nobody knew
what he was saying, until Allen W. Thur
man, the son of the "Oid Roman," stepped
forward and acknowledged bis introduc
tion by Mr. Rop*. Mr. Thurraan did not
waste words. He knew what the people
wanted, and in a few brief sentences pre
sented Mr. Bryan.
The cheering was more intense than it
had been at Mr. Bryan's appearance, and
it was several minutes before it ceased.
So great was the confusion caused by
those who could not hear that the first
words of the orator were lost to all but
those near hire, and he was obliged to
s*op until quiet was secured. But this
was not accomplished until Mr. Bryan aa
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 2, 1896.
nounced that he would speak upon all
sides of the platform. The assembled
thousands cave a shout of gratification at
this and tried to keep as quiet as their en
thusiasm would allow for the rest of the
speech.
Mr. Bryan's argument for silver coinage
covered no new points. It was begun as
follows:
This is the largest audience to whom I ever
tried to speak. 1 bave had occasions to speak
wuare tbe audience filled the house, but I
never had occasion to talk where tbe audience
fiile4 all outdoors. [Laughter.] If you all
vote as you are now shouting (voices, "We
will!"] 1 do not see how there cÂ«n be any
question about the triumph of free silver in
this State. We have entered on a campaign
which means much to the American people.
If our opponents speak truly when they de
scribe what will in their judgment be the
effect of free coinage, then the success of the
Chicfigo ticket will surely be a calamity to the
country, v. on the other hand, we speak the
truth when we describe to you the effects of a
gold standard then the maintenance of a gold
standard until foreign nations come to our re
lief is an evil which cannot be contemplated
by those who love their country. We have
begun an uncea&ing warfare against the gold
Standard.
The Republican party, without declaring
that the gold standard is a good thing, has de
clared that the gold standard must be main
tained. I call your attention to tne fact that
no party In trie history of this country has
ever in National convention commended the
goid standard. Its effects are so bad thai no
party has dared to uphold it.
At this point Mr. Bryan, who had been
facing west as he spoke, now turned to the
south front of the platform and said he
would speak for a while to the people on
that side. He continued:
The enemy whom we are fighting in this
campaign is an enemy who has never gone
into an open battle. The advocates of a gold
standard have never dared to submit tbe gold
standard to the arbitrament of a ballot.
[Cheers.] Every step that has been taken has
been taken by "stealth and without the ap
proval of the American people. [Applause.]
When silver was demonetized In 1873 the
people Lad not discussed it; and persons who
were members of (.'onfiress and who voted on
the measure testified thoy did not understand
that the bill demonetized silver. When the
crime wrs di- covered and the American peo
ple attempted to restore silver to its
ancient place by the side of gold,
the opponents of free coinage forced
the Bland act upon Congress as a
compromise, and as soon as the Bland act went
into force, tne enemies of free silver sought to
repeal the Bland act and leave nothing in Its
plfÂ»ce. But the silver sentiment grew until
1890, and in that year the opponents of free
coinage, being afraid of the passage of a free
coinage Dili, secured another compromise
which was known as the Sherman law.
DEMOCRATIC UEADQVAKTBRB.
I jion Bryan's Arrival in Chicago a Con-
ference Hill Be H<ld.
CHICAGO. 111., Sept. I.â J. W. Wilson,
United States District Attorney for Ari
zona, was among the visitors at the Illi
nois Democratic headquarters this after
noon. He is very enthusiastic over the
prospects for Bfyan's success in all the
States west of the Missouri, declaring that
California is well in line, and that the only
doubtful State west of the Mississippi is
lowa.
On Saturday an important conference
will take place at the Democratic Na
tional headquarters. Mr. Bryan will ar
ri,vo here on Friday evening, and a num
ber of the leaders have been asked to meet
him at Chairman Jones' rooms the follow
ing morning. The conference is to decide
matters in relation to the future conduct
of the campaign, and at the same meeting
the three vacancies on the National Execu
tive Committee and three on the National
Advisory Committee will be filled.
Among those to be present are Senator
Tetter of Colorado, Governor Alt<:eid of Il
linois, Governor Sone of Missouri, Com
mitteemen Campan of Michigan, Johnson
of Kansas, Gahan of Illinois and McConn
ville of Ohio, and Secretary Walsh. Mr.
Howell of Georgia will not be able to be
present. Copies of correspondence between
Treasurer St. John and a department em
ploye at Washington have been received
here. The employe desired to contribute
to the campaign fund, and asked if the
names of such contributors would be kept
quiet, in order to guard against possible
disfavor with the present administration.
Treasurer St. John replied that under no
circumstances would they be made public,
unless Mr. Bryan were elected, in which
event they might be published as a roll of
honor.
George B. Keeney, National organizer of
the silver party, and president of the as
sociation of National silver clubs* to-day
established headquarters at the Oliftoo
House, and will remain here until after
the National convention of that organi
zation, whi' h occurs on the 23d inst.
CLOSING AT WEAVERVILLE
Taking of Evidence Completed
in the Trial of Jce
Gregory.
James Simonin Says George White
Off.-red Him a Horse to Ride to
tbe Lynching.
WEAVERVILLE. Cal., Sept I.â The
counsel for the defense, Oregon Sander 3
and Robert R. Fowler, in the trial of Joe
Gregory, accused of complicity in the
murder of "Jack" Littlefield near Round
Valley on Septemoer 27, 1895, rested its
case at 2:20 o'clock this afternoon and a
recess until to-morrow morning was
granted to enable counsel to prepare argu
ments. T roughout the trial Gregory
has displayed an intense interest in the
proceedings, ana he has grown thin aud
nervous in the past week.
Richard Lightfoot, cousin of Joe Greg
ory, testified this morning that the mule
ridden by Radcliffe on the 27th bud been
shod on the 24th of September. When
asked what impressed the fact on his
memory he said that a short time after
Littlefield had been killed, and before the
preliminary examination of the accused,
he heard that somebody who was track
ing (looking for tracks?) about the scene of
the murder, had said something about
finding the tracks of a barefooted mule,
when Mrs. Williamson (Gregory's mother)
remarked: "Our mule was shod."
In rebuttal W. F. Whitney, Justice of
the Peace at Covolo, testified ti at Trapper
Fancher's reputation for truth, honesty
and integrity was bad. Sylvester Palmer
swore that the distance from the break of
Jesus Creek to the Wilburn crosbing of
Eel River was about live or six miles, and
that it woutd take a man on horseback at
least two hours to travel v. Sheriff Berpin
testified that it took him one hour and
forty-six minutes to ride from the place of
L ttU'lield's arrest to the scene of the
hanging.
James Simonin said that he had -met Joe
LU'htfoot in the middle of the afternoon
of September 26, and that Lightfoot had
invited him to join a par'y to nang Little
htld and some halfbreeds. Witness said
he had no horse, and so they went up to
GeorsÂ« W r hite's place and White tol i them
to go and pet the horse of Tuttle, his head
vaquero, and say nothing about it. In the
evening the witness backed out of the ex
pedition.

CLERGYMEN VISIT
LI HUNG CHANG.
Members of Missionary
Boards Warmly Greet
the Viceroy.
THANKS FOR HIS AID.
Foreign Work Assisted in the
Past by the Policy of the
Diplomat
HUNTINGTON MAKES A CALL.
The Railroad Magnate Accepts an In.
vitaticn to Invest Some of His
Wealth in China.
NEW YORK, N. V., Sept. I.â Li Hung
Chang received a deputation of clergymen
representing the various American boards
of foreign missions engaged in missionary
work in China. Rev. Dr. Eilenwood, sec
retary of fhe Presbyterian board of mis
sious, read an address thanking the Viceroy
for tne protection afforded American mis
sionaries in China, and for the many kind
expressions uttered by Li Hung Chang
and others of the appreciation with which
the educational work, the services of the
missionaries, both men and women, in
the hospitals and the self-denying efforts
put forth by the missionaries in the dis
tribution of relief in the tune of famine
were regarded. The clergymen were pre
sented by Hon. John \V. Foster, who said
they represented the best element in the
United States.
The special Embassador made both a
verbal and written reply. Through his
interpreter he said he appreciated the dis
interested motives which prompted the
missionaries to engage in missionary work
in China. He was especially gratified at
the good work accomplished by the medi
cal colleges. Christianity and Confucian
ism have points in common. Both taught
iueal truths, the one being positive, the
other negative. He had not words to ex
press' his appreciation of the efforts of
Americans to improve the souls, the minus
and the physique of bis countrymen.
In conclusion he observed that the
opium trade and its use was tbe great
curse of the Chinese people. He lully
appreciated tbe efforts made Dy American
missionaries to modify the traffic and
pointed with pride to the fact that no con
verts were accepted until they had aban
doned the opium-smoking baDit. He also
fully appreciated the prayers offered up
by Americans during the illness following
h:s shooting by the Japanese.
The Viceroy's written address was a for
mal acknowledgment of his grateml wel
come, in which in tne name of tbe Em
peror of China he tendered bis best thanks
lor the approval and appreciation of the
protection afforded to American mission
aries.
Then Mr. Foster presented the various
clergymen, with whom Li shook hands
cordially, in nearly every instance hÂ«Â»
a.-ktd their aues.
C. P. Huntingion wasarnon r the callers
on Li Hung Chang to-day. He came to
offer Li a private car for his journey west
ward. jLji asked the usual questions as to
age and wealth. He told Mr. Huntington
that he knew that he was a very rich man
and that he knew that h.e owned raiirojds
and steamboat lines and other Dig proper
ties. He invited Mr. Huntington to go to
China and invest some of his money
there, telling him that he wonid undoubt
edly profit by so doing. His Excellency
assured Mr. Huntington that ha would
accord him all encouragement for the in
vestment of capital in the development of
enterprises in China.
Mr. Huntington told the Viceroy that he
would go to China and look about him to
determine whether to invest money there.
This seemed to delight Li Hung Chang,
and he shook hands very cordially with
Mr. Huntington in bidding him good-by.
The Merchants' Club gave a reception to
Li Hung Chang this afternoon.
This evening, at Delmonico's, was given
a banquet in Li's honor by the Chinese
merchants of the city, the guests includ
ing also the Chinese Minister, the Con
suls-General at New York and Havana,
Govprnor Morton, General Ruger and
Mayor Strong*.
The Viceroy was not present because
while leaving the Metchants' Club alter
iunc . one of his lineers was jammed acci
dentally in the door of his carriage. In
spite of the pain Li went through the re
maiuder of the programme of the after
noon.
To-night the injured finger was suffi
ciently painful and swollen so that be re
mained in his appartments at the hotel,
his physicians devoting themselves to car
ing for the injury. He was represented at
the dinner by his son, Lord Li, and mern^
bers of his suite.
After tbe dinner Hon. John W.Foster,
in behalf o: Consul Sze, the chairman,
said that according to Chinese cus
toms there would be no toasts.
Secretary Chunc?, of the Chinese lega
tion at Washington, however, pro
posed the health of their hosts, the Chi
nese merchants, and Governor Morton, in
brief words of regret at the Viceroy's en
forced absence, asked all present to drink
to the t'mbassador's health. This closed
the function.

Town of Uskup.
Foreign Diplomats S:-nd a Second Note
to the Porle Regarding th;
Awfu C image.
BELGRADE, Servia, Sept. I.â An up
rising has occurred among the Moslems of
the town of Uskup, European Turkey,
and the Christians are being massacred
and their homes pillaged by the mob.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Turrets, Sept. I.â
The foreign diplomats have sent a second
note to the Porte calline; attention to the
conclusive evidence obtained that tbe
Moslem mob which massacred the Arme
nians was organize 1 with the connivance
of certain officials. It is known, also, that
hundreds of ruffians were brought from
the Asiatic side of the Bosporus to take
part in the work of murder and rapine,
and were sent back to their homes after
the bloody work had been finished.
The number of persons killed in Sun
day's rioting at Hasskein is estimated at
200. The owners of the houses looted are
now returning. Over 1000 persons were
massacred in the Psamatra district.
Three hundred Armenians have been
dragged out of houses and murdered.
Tlie city is perfectly quiet to-day. The
shops are open and business generally is
resumed.
The number of persons killed In Sun
day's riot at Hasskein is estimated at 200.
Over 1000 persons were massacred in the
Paamatra district, 300 Armenians having
been dragged out of their houses and mur
dered by Kalin alone.
Baron de Calice, the Austrian Embassa
dor, has had several interviews wah the
Sultan, who repeats his assurance that
ample measures have been taken to insure
quiet.
WASHINGTON, D. C. Sept. I.â The
cruiser Cincinnati has been ordered to
Turkey. This does not affect the cruise of
the Bancroft, that vessel being destined
exclusively for duty as guar.iship to tne
American legation at Constantinople,
while the Cincinnati and other vessels of
the squadron are to remain In Turkish
waters outside the Dardanelles unless
c rcumstances arise to call lor re-enforce
ments and a display of naval force.
It is explained ihat the order 3to the
Cincinnati have been in contemplation
for some time, and there is no particular
significance in their publication at the
present juncture. It is also said that it is
the intention of the department to bring
the Marblehead home as soon as she can
be spared from the Mediterranean, as t;;e
time of a great many men on the station
has expired, and it is hoped to gather
them all on the Marblehead for the home
ward cruise. So it is argued no real in
crease in the force in Turkish waters is
designed unless affairs appear to war
rant it.

ST. PAUL, Minn., Sept. I.â There isa
surplus of American patriotism in St.
Paul to-night. The Grand Army of the
Republic is in town 30,000 strong, accord
ing to tbe conservative estimates sent by
State departments to National head
quarters, and that number is expected to
march in the grand parade to-morrow. St.
Paul is congested witb a host of strangers.
Fifty thousand is the average estimate of
the number of visitors from all parts of
the Union.
The bright array of day decorations on
every street in the business district was
enhanced to-night by brilliant electric
illuminations. The flag for which the vet
erans foucht is omnipresent.
Martial music from many bands and the
marching of Grand Army posts would
give tbe city the appearance of a home
coming from the war were it not for the
absence of those weapons with which the
boys in blue once fought.
There are four openl3 r talkr.-d of candi

City; John C. Linehan of Concord, junior
vice-commander of the New Hampshire
Department, and Major T. S. Clarkson of
Nebraska. Tne strengtli of tha quartet
has not been sufficiently crystallized to ad
nni of a prediction as to the successful
candidate. By general consent, however,
this seems to be the East's year for the
coveted honors of commander and next
encampm-ni city.
The dusty road of six miles from the
city to Fort Sneliing was thronged from
early in the afternoon until late cX night
with tlie tray-haired men in blue and
other visitors More than 5000 people
went out to join in the reunion of the
Minnesota veterans, who were sent to the
front from the historic fort, and to witness
tLe parade of the regular soldiers sta
tioned there. Tiie Minnesota men made
the State Cupitol their rendezvous and
went out in streetcars to the army post.
At the western end of the bridge- vrhich
spans the Mississippi 11 ver the survivors
of the war irom Minnesota marched under
an ;trch of welcome.
They parsed the frowning bluffs which
fringe the low stone builuings and round
tower erected in 1820. Over the garrison
common they marched and came to a
magnificent arch of hewn logs, which
marks the entrance to the parade grounds
and quarters of the army pp3t.
"Welcome from Garrison No. 57"
greeted the visit' ng thousands lrora one
side of this unique arch. On the revere
were tne word-, "Our Country anu Our
Flag." An immense eagle between flags
ornamented the center on each side, and
on the summit of the arch were stationed
together an anchor aud a gun with fcar
riage.
Colonel J. H. Page, commandant of the
post, his staff and the ladies of tbe gar
rison held a reception at the colonel's
quarters for the officers â¢ and men of the
Minnesota department and Commander
in-Chief Walker. General Mason was also
present.
Columbia Post No. 706 of Chicago, Com
mander H. G. Purinton, seventy-rive
strong, was especially invited by the
colonel. There was a general happy re
union of Minnesota veterans on tr,e
spacious grounds. The Third United
States Infantry, which is the only body of
soldiers stationed at the fort now, paraded
at sundown.
There was a brilliant social function in
the evening at Summit Park and in the
Kittson residence on Summit avenue,
when Commander Walker was received
with hundreds of other veterans by a
ladies' committee of St. Paul.
C. F. Sheriff of Pittsburg was elected

INDIANAPOLIS INVADED
BY DELEGATES.
-Sound Money Democrats Will in
All Probability Nominate
Bragg and Buckner.
LEADERS IN MANY STATES SAY
M'KINLEY WILL WIN.
Peculiar Spectacle of Prominent Bour
bons RcjoiciDg in the Probable
Success of a Republican.
Headquarters of the )
Ukited Associated Presses, >
Indianapolis, Ind., Sept. 1.)
It is authoritatively stated to-night
by a personal friend of President
Cleveland that he would not accept the
nomination of the sound-money conven
tion under any circumstances, and should
his name be presented he will probably be
heard from. It is intimated that a promi
nent member of the New York delegation
has a letter to be read should the occasion
arise. It is not to be presumed, however,
that Mr. Cleveland is lacking in interest
in the work of the convention. The gen
tleman above referred to stated that while
he was not authorized to speak for Mr.
Cleveland he would venture the prediction
that if the proper kind of a platform should
be adopted the President would probably
make known his approval.
As to the opening of the convention it
can be said that crowded hotels, enthusi
astic workers and brass bands â three ac
companiments of a National convention â
which were not visible in the Indianapolis
round-money gathering till to-day, were
all supplied this afternoon. The rush of
deiegates was so great as to fairly swamp
the leading hotels, which, though admir
ably managed, are not capacious.
McKinley demonstrations and free-sil
ver shouters aided to block the streets in
numbers almost as great as those of the
sound-mor.ey men.
Every fresh arrival seemed to bring
news which added to the enthusiasm of
the opponents of the Chicago ticket. Sen
ator Vilas be.^an it by stating that Wis
consin would be carried for McKinley.
Senator Caffery followed, declaring that
many old-time Democrats in Louisiana
had gone so far in the McKinley direction
that it was impossible to call them back.
Governor Stockley of Delaware asserted
that ii tbe Republicans of that State would
unite they could carry it for McKinley.
Governor Jones of Alabama did not hesi
tate to express his belief that Bryan could
be defeated in his State, and Judge Euclid
Martin of Nebraska said that the nominee
of the Chicago convention would fail to
carry even his own State. From Tennes
see and Oregon and other States came
similar assurances.
The spectacle thus presented of t>romi
nent I)emocrats rejoicing over the prob
able success of a Republican candidate
forms one of the most remarkable anoma
lies of the situation.
Another unusual feature is the entire
absence of any agtrressive competition for
the nomination. Tbe trend of sentiment
favors Bragg and Buckner, but there is a
strong undercurrent for Vilas.
The conferences held by the several
delegations to-day have strengthened a
movement to put up Bound-money .Demo
cratic State tickets in all the Central States
that are considered fighting ground. Illi
nois, Michigan and Missouri have led the
way. Wisconsin and Minnesota are sure
to follow, and there is a feeling that In
diana should do likewise and make the
fight all along the line.
ARRIVAL OF DELEGATIONS.
Prominent Leaders Tell of the
Steady Growth of the Sound-
Money Sentiment.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Sept. I.â The
early morning trains brought many dele
gates to the National Democratic Conven
tion. General Bragg and Senator Vilas of
Wisconsin were amon^ the first arrivals.
John P. Irish, formerly of the Bureau of
Engraving and Printing at the National
capital, now a resident of California, came
on as an avant courier of the California
delegation. He reported that members
from tne southern part of the State were
shut off by the waÃhout and would not be
able to reach Indianapolis in time.
The California delegates, Mr. Irish ex
plained, had held no meeting since their
appointment, and therefore it was im
possible to say whom they favored to head
the ticket. The delegates were, however,
for a platform, a ticket and a red-hot fight.
Mr. Irish added that Oregon and Wash
ington will be represented in the conven
tion.
"We have been emolling voters," said
Mr. Irish, "in the sound-money move
ment in California for the last month, and
we now nave 25,000 Democrats with us.
The Bryan Populists propose resorting to
the courts to prevent us getting a Demo
cratic electoral ticket printed on the offi
cial ballot. If they get the matter into
the courts at this late day the delay of a
decision may keep us off the official bal
lot, owing io the peculiar election law of
California. If the Populists resort to this
technicality to prevent an expression of
our opinion, we will express our opinion
in a way that will leave them with a very
admonitory memory.
Senator Vilas told a representative of
the United Associated Presses that the in
dications were that McKinley would carry
Wisconsin, and that al least 20 or 25 per
cent of the Democrats of the State would
fall in line for the nominees of the Indian
apolis convention.
The Senator was informed that there
was considerable talk of making him the
nominee of the convention, but he de
clined to discuss the matter.
.Ferry Beimont of New York said to-day:
â¢'i hope to vote for an electoral ticket to
be nominated here, presenting as the
Democratic candidate for President a man
in whose loyalty to Democratic principles
implicit confidence can be staked. The
'â¢reservation of Democratic principles in
their entirety will be of incalculable value
to the country in the future.
"The fact is," Mr. Beimont continued,
"the root of our financial troubles lies in
the continuance of Government paper
money which needs constant redemption.
The sounder our currency the better will
be our credit, the greater our financial in
dependence, and the less need there will
be of borrowing or resorting to the unde
sirable aid of bond syndicates. No one
can be more desirous of avoiding this ne
cessity than I am. Threats of repudia
tion, advocacy of unsound and depre
ciated currency, render doubly difficult
the protection of the public credit. Those
who talk about a dearer and scarcer dollar
themselves create what they consider to
be a contraction in the volume of the cur
rency, which is in reality the withdrawal
of confidence and capital from our indus
tries pro uced by agitators of financial
heresies, who would wreck prosperity alto
gether in an attempt to uphold their tneo
ries of coinage and currency."
A delegation of eighteen all the way
from Florida arrived at noon and were
escorted to their quarters by a brass band.
The delegation displayed a gilded alliga
tor labeled "Florida gold bug," and each
man carried a large waving palm leaf.
The Florida delegation came in occupying
a coach, on the siile of which was a streamer
running its full length inscribed "Florida's
sound money Democracy." At their head,
following the banner, constructed here by
their order, was a picture of President
Grover Cleveland, surrounded by the
words: "Our candidate for President."
Following the Florida delegation came
the Louisiana delegation in a special car
over the Big Four line from Cincinnati,
headed by Senator Caffery. Their car
carried a streamer similar to that on tne
car of the Florida delegation. Senator
Caffery, who is to oe the permanent chair
man of the convention, said to a reporter
ior the United Associated Presses that his
delegation had not agreed to support any
particular candidate, but were for the
ticket which the convention might decide
to be the strongest.
"No man conversant with the condition
of affairs in the South," said Senator Caf
fery, "can deny that there is a very pro
nounced feeling in favor of sound money,
and that the men who advocate that sen
timent wiil vote their convictions. This
is the case not only in my State of Louisi
ana, but in other parts of the South. The
fact is that a ereat many old-time Demo
crats immediately after the Chicago con
vention renounced the ticket and the
platform and declared themselves for Mc-
Kinley as the lesser of the two evils.
While they did not agree with the Repub
lican candidate on the tariff question and
other tenets of the Republican faith for
which he stands thoy did approve of his
financial views. These men have, many
of them, gone so far that it is now impos
sible to get them back, even for the third
ticket which we will here nominate."
Several Tennessee delegates came in
with the Florida delegation. One of them,
Theodore Coole of Nashville, said: "Peo
ple down our way think Bragg and Buck
ner the logical candidates of the conven
tion. There is, however, a strong sentiment
for Grover Cleveland."
Joseph Bryan, the head of the sound
money movement in Virginia, reached In
dianapolis to-day at the head of a delega
tion of fifteen men. "I am more than
pleased with the outlooK," said Mr.
Bryan to a representative of the United
Associated Presses. "It has long been
considered treason in Virginia for a Demo
crat to say a word in condemnation of the
ticket named by the party, but I wish to
say that this year the woods of the old
commonwealth, if that be treason, are full
of traitors."
The New York State delegation, seventy
two strong, arrived here on a special train
at 2:30 this afternoon with ex-Governor
Flower at their head. DeWitt Warner
told a representative of the United Asso
ciated Presses that the delegates had no
choice for first or second place on the
ticket. ' â¢
The Pennsylvania delegation reached
Indianapolis late this evening over the
Pennsylvania Railroad. There were
seventy men in the party. The delegates
discussed the situation on the train and de
cided not to advocate the candidacy of
any one individual, but to vote for the
best man, snowing the strongest follow
ing, when the proper time arrives.
The Indiana delegation met at State
headquarters this morning and elected
delegates. The delegates did not discuss
preferences for the Presidential nomina
tion. What expressions were given by
members of the delegation point toward a
vote for Bragg and Buckner.
Governor Stockley of Delaware said his
State had no intention of presenting the
name of Senator Gray to the convention.
"We realize," said he, "that this sound
money movement requires a Western
man to lead it. The West is our battle
ground.
According to the sound-money delegates
from Nebraska who arrived this after
noon the nomination of a strong tic&et
here will draw from 18 000 to 20,000 votes
from Bryan in his own State and assure
the electoral vote for McKinley. Judge
Euclid Martin, the chairman of the dele
gation, .-aid that Nebraska has had a
sound-money Democratic organization for
four years and that every district in the
State is represented here. He did not
care to make predictions which would not
be substantiated later, and preferred to
underestimate rather than exaggerate the
chances for the defeat of Bryan in his
own State, but that while the result will
be close he believed that McKinley would
win. Other members of the delegation
were more positive in their claims.
All doubt about Arkansas being repre
sented in the convention was dissipated at
3 p. m., when twenty substantial lookine
citizens arrived. They were headed by
Colonel Fordyce, the chairman of the dele
gation. They brought no boom ior candi
dates with them, but were enthusiastic in
the demand for the nomination of a strong
ticket and lor a permanent organization of
the sound-money Democracy.
The Oregon delegation arrived this after
noon. They say the silver sentiment in
their State is dying out. Judge McCarthy,
one of the leading members of the delega
tion, declared that McKinley will certainly
carry Oregon.
The Massachusetts delegation said:
"Let the West and South settle it. All we
ask is that good sound- money Democrats
be named. We have no candidates to
present."
Although the committee on resolutions
has not yet been appointed the proposed
financial plank of the platform has been
discussed during the day by the leaders.
There will be no scaicity of planks from
which to make a choice. They differ in
language, but there is a unanimous de
mand for an unequivocal and severe
arraignment of the free coinage of silver
The following plank has been under care
ful consideration, and many of the most
prominent men in the party have ex
pressed their entire satislaction with its
text:
We adhere with unwavering faith to the
teachings and to the warnings of Jefferson,
Jackson, Benton, Tilden and Cleveland, and
therefore we demand the best, the most stable
and the most honest of money for the people
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 2, 1896.
for this greatest of nations; which money, by
the wisdom, experience and usage of this and
other enlightened countries, must under ex
isting circumstances, be bimetallic, but must
be measured by the existing standard of gold
and should consist of gold, with a bank cur
rency well secured and redeemable in gold,
and with the use of silver and other metals
within the reasonable limits prescribed by
convenience and safety, aud to be kept at a
par with gold.
We believe it is undemocratic and unwise
for the Government to debase our money or to
issue paper currency, or by adopting the silver
standard to set this Nation Dack from its
financial place among enlightened peoples, to
a monetary fellowship with the silver mono
metallists of Asia.
We deem it folly and rashness on the part of
this country jo discard the long existing gold
standard of the United States, of England, of
Germany, of Austria, of Denmark, of Norway,
of Sweden, of Greece, of Holland, of Spain, of
Italy, of Brazil, of Chile, of Belgium, of France
and the other enlightened nations of the
world and to adopt tbe outgrown and discred
ited silver standard of Mexico, of Peru, China
aud of the other half-civilized and pauper
nations. We believe the unlimited free coin
age of silver at the ratio of 16 to 1, when in
the markets of the %vond its ratio is only 32 to
1, would bring disaster upon our people and
threaten the stability of our institutions.
While it is the intention to incorporate
a tariff plank in the platform, relatively
little attention has thus far been given to
that subject. It appears to be the desire
to make this plank short and thoroughly
Democratic. Of several such planks sub
mitted to-day, the one which meets with
most favor reads as follows:
We adhere to the Democratic doctrines of
the tariff reform and for a tariff for revenue
only, under which the taxes exacted and the
burdens imposed shall not be increased to
give special emoluments to the few, but shall
be limited to the necessities of the Government
economically administered.
Tne Wisconsin delegation met this after
noon und organized by electing General E.
S. Bragg chairman, and George W. Dyer
secretary. It was decided that ex-Repre
sentative Jones of Madison present the
name of General Bragg as candidate for
the Presidential nomination. Members
of the delegation stated that assurances of
support for General Bragg had been made
by delegates from Southern and Eastern
States, and that the West was practically
solid for him.
A large contingent of sound-money men
arrived from Alabama and Georgia at 6
o'clock this evening, accompanied by a
brass band. About 300 men comprised the
party. They were met at the depot by
delegates from lowa and New York, who
escorted tiiem to their headquarters. The
men formed in line at the depot and
marched through the principal streets,
and were enthusiastically received. Gov
ernor Jones expressed himself as being
proud of the fine showing made by the
Alabama delegation.
"We have in our State," said the Gov
ernor, "the opportunity of a lifetime, and
we intend to profit by it. I believe that
we can deliver the electoral vote of that
State to the nominee of this convention.
1 say this in all seriousness, because I
know the temper of the people. Of course,
there is a division in the old Democratic
parly, but there are sufficient sound
money Democrats in the State, added to
the straight Republican votÂ«, to throw tbe
State to McKinley if we can do notiiing
else. The Populists are making claims
that cannot be worked out."
LEADERS IN CONFERENCE
Agree Upon a Plan of Procedure
In the Convention and Tem
porary Organization.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Sept. I.â A con
ference was held to-night in the room of
Senator Vilas, attended by the Senator,
Chairman Bynum of the executive com
mittee, Cnairman Palmer of the National
Committee, Hugh Wallace and other lead
ers. It was the intention to formally talk
over the platform, but there were so many
interruptions that the conference confined
itself to arranging a programme for to
morrow's convention. The following ar
rangement was agreed upon:
The convention will be called to order
by General Palmer at 12 o'clock. General
Palmer wiil make a brief speech and in
troduce the temporary chairman, ex-
Governor Flower. Secretary Wilson of
the National Committee will be made
temporary secretary of the convention.
After the address of Governor Flower a
resolution will be prepared providing for
tbe committees. The roll of States will
then be called in order that the members
cf these committees may be reported to
the convention. A resolution will be
offered referring all resolutions to the
committee until read and an adjournment
wiil be taken until 4 o'clock.
Upon reconvening the permanent or
ganization, with Senator Caffery in the
chair, will be installed, and the conven
tion will listen to Senator Caffery's speech,
Thus all the preliminaries will be gotten
out of the way to-morrow, and when the
convention meets again at 11 o'clock on
Thursday the platform can be taken up at
once and the nominations made immedi
ately thereafter.
The Oregon delegation organized to-day
and adopted the following resolutions,
which it is their purpose to offer in the
convention:
Resolved, That it Is the sense of the conven
tion that permanent organization of the party
in convention now assembled isuiecessary and
desirable; that a National conftiHtee be se
lected Agreeable to the usages of the Demo
cratic party, whose duty shÃll be to call future
conventions of the party from time to time,
apportion delegates thereto and provide the
time and place for the holding thereof and
perform the duties which usually devolve
upon the committee of a political party. Com
plete organization throughout the States Is
earnestly recommended. We favor the us* of
gold and silver as money, but insist upon the
maintenance of the present gold standard and
that silver shall only be used so far as it safely
may be and consistently with such gold
standard. We oppose the use of fiat money in
any form, and believe that the retirement of
all such money as recommended by the pres
ent administration is necessary to preserve a
sound and stable currency.
MRS. HENDRICKS OBJECTS.
Protests Against the Display of a
Picture of Her Deceased
Husband.
INDIANAPOLIS, In, Sept. I.â The
convention will be held in Tomlinson Hall,
which has a seating capacity about equal
to the Mechanics' Pavilion in San Fran
cisco, but it is not anticipated that it will
be more than comfortably filled.
A picture of Thomas A. Hendricks
adorns one of the walls, and the widow of
the deceased statesman was much in
censed to-night when she discovered it.
She visited the committee of arrange
ments and declared excitedly that while
her deceased husband may have been a
believer in good money be "never bolted"
a Democratic ticket in his life.
Politics is being discussed by men,
women and children in Indiana, on the
streets and hotel lobbies of the cities and
the corner groceries of small hoosier
towns are scenes of animated debates
which frequently terminate in fisticuffs.
On a Pennsylvania railroad train from
Washington .Uiis morning a free-for-all
light took place over a discussion of the
money question and two participants were
Beriously injured. The financial problem
is the all-absorbing topic, and even the
teachers in the public schools of Indian
apolis are undertaking to enlighten the
young idea on the subject.

APPARENT INDIFFERENCE.
Politicians at Washington Head-
quarters Pretend Not to Be
Interested In the Convention.
WASHINGTON, D. C. Sept. I.â A won
derful amount of apparent indifference is
manifested around political headquarters
here as to the convention of National
Democrats which assembles at Indianapo
lis to-morrow. If anything the Repub
licans are watching the movements of the
gold Democrats with more real interest
than the allied silver forces, a block be
low on the same street. The leaders of the
silver forces claim to have discounted the
defection of the gold Democrats long ago.
They say that when the Chicago conven
tion declared for silver and nominated
Bryan they Knew there would be a bolt.
They took all that into consideration
when they acted. They allege that move
ment has not been any larger or of any
more importance or power than they an
ticipated. It matters little to them, they
assert, what is done. No action that is
taken will affect their confidence in the
result of the election. t
The position of the Republicans is that
they cannot oe hurt by the convention,
and they do not know whether they can
be helped to any great extentâ that is,
its beneficial results will not be general.
The hope of the Republicans is that some
man will be nominated who will be ac
ceptable to the large element of Southern
Democrats believed to be backing up the
movement.
There is a feeling among Republican
leaders that the right kind of ticket at In
dianapolis might play havoc with the
Democratic party in a number of Southern
States. In Louisiana there is a wealthy
and influential faction of the Democratic
party who will support a strong nominee.
In Florida there is almost the same kind
of an element. If gold Democratic electors
could be put out in these States and in
dorsed by Republicans and other anti
silver elements, it is expected the result
might be changed.
There are floating hints that in several
States where gold Democrats have made a
good showing Chairman Hanna would be
willing to advise the Republicans to with
draw and support gold Democratic elec
tors or fuse with them. It is hinted that
he might do this in two States named, as
well as in Texas, and probably in Ala
bama. Chairman Hanna is well aware
that conditions are such that those States
woul<l not permit Republican electors to
be elected. Lookinc at it this way, he
might agree to let gold Democrats run the
whole thing, hoping that they would suc
ceed. If such a plan could be put into
operation and should be successful it
would be in line with the belief of some of
the silver leaders that the hope of the gold
Democrats is to hold the balance of power
in the electoral college. The silver men
look upon this as a remote possibility.
STOLEN FROM HER HOME
After Thirteen Years of Mystery
a Strange Story Comes
to Light.
The Central Figure a Washington Gin
Who Has Been Raised in
San Francisco.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Sept. I.â A gen
uine Charley Ross story came to light here
a few days agoâ only the stolen one was
discovered, but not until after an absence
of thirteen years. In this case Lillie Zeno
bia Daley, a good-looking colored girl, is
the central figure. She is now eighteen
years old, and was taken from here by a
colored woman named Emma Cooper, or
Butler, who has since died. When the
woman died in San Francisco not long ago
the girl made anxious inquiry aDout her rel
atives, and succeeded in interesting A.
Lucas, head of a private detective agency,
in her case, and he made inquiries about
her.
Mr. Lucas sent to Washington detectives
a letter written by the girl in which she
claimed that she was barn in Washington,
her mother having been a white woman,
while her father was a mulatto. One day
a neighbor named Mrs. Butler took her to
the railroad-cars and then suddenly
boarded the train, takinc the girl along
with her. When they reached Chicago
her abductor told her that she must say
she was Mrs. Butler's daughter. One day
the girl found in Mrs. Butler's trunk a
letter, from which she learned that her
own mother was paying her Doard. When
Mr-. Butler died, one of her relatives told
the girl that "Walter Butler, who works
as a clerk in the Liverpool and London
and Globe Insurance Company's otliee at
422 California stn-et, San Francisco, would
tell her something when she reached her
majority." When she became of age she
called on Mr. Butler, but there being a
coolness between them he did not divulge
anything he may have known.
The Washington police made inquiries
and have succeeded in finding the girl's
relatives. It developed that the girl,
Zenobia Daley, was actually stolen from
here by the woman, Emma Cooper or
Butler. Mrs. Cooper it seems had formed
an attachment (or Lillie and had expressed
a desire to adopt her, but she could not do
so, for the child's parents were prosperous
and even on the death of her father the
mother got along well. One day, however,
Mrs. Cooper said she was going to the
train to see her husband off and took the
child along for company, and that was the
last Been of her.
Mrs. Daley, almost heart-broken, made
every effort to discover the whereabouts
of her child. Local authorities succeeded
in accomplishing nothing, and then she
asked the assistance of pastors in many
States. She traveled considerably in her
efforts to locate the child, but in vain, for
she never succeeded in finding the slight
est clew to her whereabouts and died with
out seeing her again. The girl's grand
mother, Mrs. Rachael Moore, and her two
sisters live here. The news of the where
abouts of the missing one caused joy in
the lamily. and the sisters as well ;ts~ the
grandmother are hoping that they will be
again united.
Mrs. Moore is financially unable to
render assistance to her grandchild be
cause of the expensive railroad trip, but it
is possible thai she may receive the aid of
sone charitable people.

AN HONEST DOLLAR THAT CAN
CHEAT NOBODY.
"Let Us Have Neither Free Trade
Nor Free Silver," Says the
Great Protectionist.
CANTON, Ohio, Sept. I.â The advent of
autumn was notable in Canton by the ar
rival of a delegation of the Republican
editors of West Virginia, 95 per cent of the
Republican newspapers of the State being
represented by iheir editors or owners in
the delegation, and every man as well as
woman and child -.vho accompanied came
to see Major McKinley.
The editors alter dinner marched to the
McKinley residence. The appearance of
the major was the signal for an outburst
of applause. He was introduced by Hon.
P. W. Morris, editor of the Ritchie Ga
zette and president of the Republican
Press Association of West Virginia.
Major McKinley was heartily and re
peatedly cheered by the men when he
stepped forth to make answer to the ad
dress of Mr. Morris, The ladies waved
their handkerchiefs and clapped their
hands. Major McKinley said:
The *ause In which you are engaged this
year is one commanding Doth conscience and
interest. The Republican cause was never
more just and righteous than this year, and
the triumph of its principles was never more
essential to the general welfare of the Ameri
can people than now. We have had great po
litical contests in the past, but I doubt if any
was ever waged which involved higher inter
ests to the people and to the country at large
than those presented in this campaign. [Ap
plause and cries of "That's rignt."] Nothing
is more vital to the standing and progress of a
country than tbe preservn tioi^ of its credit
and financial honor. [Applause and cries of
"That's right, too."] Nothing is more indis
pensible to business and prosperity than that
the currency of the country shall be so hones i.
that it can cheat nobody. [Great cheering.]
Nothing is of greater moment to the welfare
of the country than the adoption of a policy
which will give to labor and capital constant
employment with fair returns. [Applause and
cries of "Good."] But, gentlemen, lying be
neath all these, and more important than all
tiiese, is the preservation of law and order
the reign of domestic quiet. [Cheers.] All
these are embraced in the contention which is
upon us this year.
In connection with the questions as editors
and publishers you have the gravest responsi
bilities. You help to make publio sentiment
and a right public sentiment is what is most
needed at this juncture of our National affairs.
Never was the press of the country more
aroused to these issues than now. Never dia
i he Republican cause hove such mighty sup
port from the newspapers of the United States
as it has to-day. This help is not confined to
the Republican press alone, but includes many
ol the greatest newspapers which have hither
to advocated the Democratic cause. [Applause.]
All this is an evidence that the people appre
ciate that a great cri3is is upon them and that
the way to avoid that crisis is lor patriotic
men of every section of the country to unite
and act together in the common cause of coun
try. [Great applause.] It is no selfish con
cern, therefore, that prompts me to express
the hope that West Virginia may be
come permanently a Republscrn State
[Cheers aud cries of "It will go
Republican this fall all right"], and that what
she gr.ined so gloriously in 1894 will not be
lost in 1896. [Great applause.] The Repub
lican party aims higher than that. It is not
mereiy the success of individuals or party, but
the good of the country it seeks, anr. it is in
that spirit, animated only by patriotic senti
ment, that I wish always to constantly speak
and act. [Applause.]
The major then made a rapid review of
the natural resources of West Virginia,
her manufactures, mines, agriculture,
wool-raising, etc., and continued:
Hovr much these several industries have suf
fered in the last three years you know better
than I could tell you. How much the wooi
growers havo lost, those who have sheep and
raise wool know accurately. They know what
the experience of the last three years has cost
them to the very cent. All these interests are
directly affected; all are directly benefited or
injured by our industrial legislation. You
know, and the people know, that every one of
them were advanced by Republican legisla
tion [applause] and that all of them have been
more or le6S injured by Democratic legislation.
[Applause and cries of '-You are right!"] With
such almost inexhaustible wealth in your
midst, with such possibilities of development
and growth; with so excellent a foundation
for increased business and greater general
prosperity, 1 bid you newspapermen to lose no
opportunity to arouse your people to the real
ization ot the true interests and to the im
mense importance to them of the issues of the
present campaign, as they affect their mate
rial welfare in every business calling or occu
pation that can be named. Your interests as
a people no longer run on sectional lines.
[Cheers.] Thank God, the last lingering es
trangements between the North and the South
are being forever effaced. [Great applause.]
And the appeal for the restoration of the
American system of protection and the cod
tinuance of a sounl system of finance is
Infinitely more important to West Virginia
than any other political question that could
engage their attention. [Applause.] Patriot
ism is paramount, and the people's welfare and
their country's honoi are the supreme and
overmastering issues commanding the atten
tion of both North and South. [Great ap
plause.] It you continue to advance in the
next twenty years as you advanced from 1870
to 1890, you can only hope to do it under a
system which encourages home industry and
give 6 steady employment to willing hands at
remunerative wages. [Tremendous cheering
aud cries of "Hurrah ior McKinley!"] Strive
for a fuller development of your industries;
build up a greater and more profitable home
market for the products of your farms;
advance a ways that prosperity which enables
the employer to pay the highest scale
of wages to the workingmen of Americaâ not
the lowest. [Cheers.] Exalt the character of
your labor. Never degrade it. Promote that
comfort and contentment at home which con
duces to good citizenship, good morals and
good order. Btand up for America and
America will stand up for you. [Great ap
plause and cries of "Hurrah for McKinley!"]
Restore the principle in our constitution
which gave us prosperity. [Cries of "That's
right."] Keep the credit of the Government
untarnished above all else. [Applause.] Keep
the currency up to the highest standard of.
civilired nations. (Renewed applause.] No
nation of the world must have better money
than we have, and no nation of the world has
better money than we have. [Great cheering.]
And it is no reflection either upon our honor
or indepencence that we refuse to adopt the
financial policy of China or Mexico. [Re
newed cheering.] Let us have neither free
trade nor free silver. [Cries of "We won't."]
Work and wages have been cut in two, and we
spurn the same experiment on the money in
which they are paid. [Loud applause and
cries of "Hurrah for McKinley !"J
We want the same good money in the future
that we have had since Jannary 1, 1879, and
that we intend to have. [Cries of "That's
right!"] We want honest dollars, and intend,
like honest people, to pay our honest debts
with them â Government and people. [Cheers.]
Our great neÂ«d now is a chance to earn these
honest dollars by honest work at home, and
let us do our work in the United States. [Re
newed apolause.] And then there will not be
an idle man beneath our flag. [Continued ap
plause and cries of "Hurrah for McKinley!"]
fcuch is the policy, newspaper men and friends,
that I bid you most zealously urge for the great
good of the people of West Virginia and the ul
timate good of all the people. [Cheers. ]
Major McKinley was charmed with the
visit and was most cordial in his personal
meetings with his West Virginia guests.
â¢'Major McKinley's speech," said Hon.
A. B. White, secretary of the Republican
committee of West Virginia, "will be of
untold service to the Republicans in our
State. It is a message freighted with in
formation and wisdom. It will add to our
strength in every community. It shows
our people how great is their interest in
protection and makes clear to them that
their material prosperity depends upon
the success of the Republican party. We
are gaining ground every day in West
Virginia and we are working and lighting
hard every day."
The editors returned to Wheeling this
evening, there to separate and go to their
respective homes. Some of them traveled
nearly 400 miles to call on Maior McKinley
to-day.
CHAIRMAX J/.i.VAj COMING.

CHICAGO, 111., Sept. I.â Chairman
Hanna is expected to arrive in Chicago
on Friaay and a general rounding-up is

XEBK^sKa JtAXKS FAIL.
The Collapse of One Causes the Closing
of Another.
BEATRICE, Nebb., Sept. I.â The First
National Bank, the oldest institution of
the kind in the city and supposedly one of
the strongest in the State, voluntarily
closed its doors this afternoon immedi
ately following a meeting of the board of
directors. Its closing caused much sur
prise. The capital stock of the bank is
$100,000 and surplus and undivided profits
159,000. It is officered by J. E. Smith as
president and S. C. Smith as cashier, and
thesn gentlemen own over $65,000 of the
stock. The liability of the Uant is $110,
-000 and the assets are placed at $250,000.
The closing of the bank carries with it the
Beatrice Savings Bank, a State institu
tion, with a paid up capital of $25,000 and
a surplus of $10,000. Its deposits amount
to $290,000. The failure is due to a variety
of causes, largely the result of the prevail
ing financial stringency and three succes
sive crop failures. The Smith brothers
stand high as business men and an at
tempt will be made to reorganize. Thus
far the other banks have not been affected.

This Election Considered an Indication
of How the Country Will Go
in November.
WHITE RIVER JUNCTION, Vt.. Bept.
L â The State election in Vermont to-day
was favored with excellent weather, and
as a result the total vote was largely in
excess of that cast four years ago, and the
Republican majority is increased beyond
the hopes of the most sangnina claims of
that party, being figured on a percentage
basis as something like 37,000 against 17,
-956 in 1892.
The latest returns show increased gains
in the Legislature, although the returns
are not yet complete. The indications
are that in a total of 244 members of the
lower House not more than a dozen will
be Democrats. The Senate will be com
posed entirely of Republicans.
Returns from 150 towns give Grout (R.)
36.833; Jackson (D.), 10,214; Battell(Pop.),
498; Whittemore<Pro.), 462. Grout's plu
rality, 26.66 D; majority over all, 25,709.
The same towns in 1892 gave Fuller (R.)
26.964, Smalley (D.) 13,623; all others, 1123.
The Republican gain in these towns is
9919 or 33 per cent, whereas the Demo
cratic vote shows a loss of 3049 or 25 per
cent.
The combined Populist, Prohibition and
scattering vote is less than in 1892.
ST. ALBANS, Vt., Sept. I.â Chairman
Morrill of the Republican State Commit
tee has issued a final bulletin for 230 out
of 245 towns, claiming a Republican ma
jority of 37,824.
The remaining towns in 1894 gave a Re
publican majority of 1101, and with this
majority added Mr. Morrill figures a
majority of 39,000 for the head of the
ticket.

OPENING DAY AT
THE STATE FAIR,
Crowds Visit the Pavilion
to View an Array
. of Exhibits.
FRUIT, COLOR AND ART.
The Displays More Numerous
and Extensive Than
Ever Before.
GROUPED IN UNIQUE DESIGNS.
Exposition Hall Clothed in Gay Decor
ations and Brilliantly
Il'uminated.
BACRAMENTO, Cal., Sept. I.â The
J>tate Fair opened to-day. This afternoon
ell the talk yras horse, and nearly all the
street cars in the capitol city ran to the
Jrace track. To-night all the street cars
xan to the pavilion, and all the talk was
of exhibits. The racetrack and pavilion
are now the common destination of the
crowds that are daily growing larger.
Everybody who went anywhere in par
ticular to-night wended his way to the
exposition building, which is another
name for the pavilion. In the vast space
of this building every inch of room is
taken. There never was anything like it
before in the history of the State Agri
cultural Society. The space is not all
quite covered yet, neither is the sound of
the hammer and the hoarse rasp of the
tip-saw entirely hushed, but before an
other day or two are passed all exhibits
â will be standine forth complete in the
beauty of their design.
Coming down to figures, the finishing
touches have been put on fully 95 per cent
of the exhibits. Long curtains still sur
round some of the exhibits, awaiting the
last artistic ornaments. These served to
increase tae attention and curiosity of
spectators to-night. Groups of people
â tood before blank walls of red and white,
heard the murmur of voices behind them
and wondered with more than ordinary
curiosity what was inside. A glimpse
now and then indicated that when the
curtains do drop the spectacle will be
â¢worth coming again to see.
Visitors are coming in by every train.
The fair will remain open nearly three
â weeks, instead of two weeks, as in former
years. Exhibitors are proverbially slow
in getting ready for the opening day, ow
ing to the fact that a large crowd is, as a
rule, not in attendance on that day, but
this year the pavilion is further along on
opening day than it has ever been before.
This morning the art gallery was chaos,
paved with scattered pictures and rough
boxes. To-night the works of art were
hanging in beautiful array and order on
the walls, under the rays of aceteline gas,
the powerful new illuminator whose Dirth
place was the brain of a Boston genius. In
all there are about 500 pictures, embracing
all descriptions of art on canvas, from
fruit and landscapes and studies in what
Trilby would call "the altogether" down
to many admirable pen sketches by news
paper artists. The newspaper artists'
sketches excite curiosity more than a
study in oil and water colors, and there is
always a crowd before this rennaissance of
the pen applied to current events.
The art gallery is one of the principal
features of the fair. One may step from
the inspection of livestock and blooded
horses to a contemplation of the works of
the old masters. There are not very many
large canvases, but there is not a picture
in the entire collection that has ever been
on the walls before. It is a compliment to
Ban Francisco art and artists to say that
most of the loans are from that City and
irom artists both at home and abroad. A
novelty introduced this year is sketches
ircm the studios of well-known artists
â¢which were made from nature, and from
which larger and more ambitious works
â¢were produced. This collection includes
clever fragments from Jouillin, Stanton,
Robinson, Pages, Peixotto, Martinez and
others. There are also new Yosemite pic
tures from the brush of Thomas Hill.
Among the other clever ones whose
â work adorns the walls are Jules Tavernier,
Eva Withrow, Alice Chittenden, Henry
Roschen, C. D. Robinson, Joe D. Strong
and Miss May Hinkson. A large Egyp
tian scene, with a vista of a ruined palace,
pyramids, sphinxes and obelisks, serves
as a sort of background for the array of
pictures.
The scene from the main entrance of
the; pavilion is one of spectacular beauty.
The galleries are draped in green and the
other predominating colors are blue, red
and yellow, with here and there a strip or
an expanse of white. The flags and ban
ners, together with the main colors of all
States of the Union and all nations and
principalities of the Old World, hang
from the lofty roof or adorn the walls.
Great draperies of color also hang from
the rafters, and the pinnacles of some of
the taller exhiDits are lost in the clouds of
flags and festoons. Much in evidence are
the bear flag and "Old Glory." C ,er the
entire main floor there is a sky of varia
gated colors.
The first thing that confronts the spec
tator on entering the pavilion is the
shapely figures of horses, harnessed to
carriages or standing alone. They seem
to have come down from the racetrack
and to stand as the head of a procession of
immovable displays. Directly in front is
an obelisk of light, a tower of electricity
â¢which extends upward into the canopy of
color. Surmounting it in brieht yellow
bulbs are the letters "8. E. G. and Ry.
Co." â Sactamento Electric, Gas and Rail
way Company.
This tower tops a beautiful pagoda
which has been erected by the company in
the center-of the main floor, in which are
displayed cooking utensils and other ap
pliances illustrating the practical or do
mestic uses to which electricity may be
put. The company furnishes the entire
electric power for Sacramento, and the
people here give it credit for inaugurating
a new era in the history of the capital
city â an era of comparatively cheap man
ufacturing. On one side of the tali black
column are the words in glowing electric
letters: "Let there be light," and on the
opposite side the names, ''Edison, Teslar,
Thompson and Franklin."
To the left is Machinery Hall, with its
ratue and whirr, and off to the right the
first thing that catches the eye is a bril
liantly illuminated arch of fruit.
The semi-circle is composed of hand
some glass jars of preserved fruit, and
across the top of the. arch is an electric
flap, the red, white and blue portrayed in
incandescent electric bulbs, even to the
forty-five white stars on a field of blue.
This arch spans the entrance to the great
wing of the main building, in which is
located the department of horticulture
and viticulture. This is one of the most
beautiful departments of the fair. It is
also deliciously romantic.
In order to offset the difficulty of keep
ing perishable and delicate fruits during
the entire fair, there will be a special ex
hibit of peaches, nectarines, plums, prunes
and figs during the second week of the fair.
Down a wide center aisle and at the far
The Interior of the Exposition Pavilion at Sacramento, With Its Crowds of Sightseers, on the Opening
Night of .the State Fair.
ther end of the .main view, Cassasa's Band
occupies a beautiful white band-stand.
There was a crowd around the band-stand
all evening, and from the galleries many
faces looked down upon it.
To the ri<iht oi the main aisle is a sylvan
retreat, with many pretty nooks, con
structed by a florist. In the center is a
j large fountain and a pond. The main
, floor is stacked with all manner of hand
-1 some booths and exhibits, and in the gal
! leries, which extend around the entire
i building, are as many more.
Some idea of the extent of the exhibits
of the fair may be had from the following
classification; First department â live
stock; second department â machinery,
implements, etc.; third department â tex
tile fabrics (mill and domestic products),
and juvenile exhibit; fourth depart
ment â mechanical products and California
inventions, designs, etc.* hfth depart
ment â dairy products and dairy utensils:
sixth department â horticultural products;
seventh department â viticulture; eighth
department â agricultural products; ninth
departmentâ fine arts, etc.

evening, through the error of a brake
man, a life was sacrificed and two human
beings seriously injured. Train 9 had
orders to meet tram 8 at Summit, and No.
9 being eastbound and what is termed in
railroad parlance, an inferior train, had
to take a siding. The switch was thrown
by a brakeman, but the fatal error was
made by replacing the switch before all
the train had cleared the main line. Two
box cars and a caboose still remained,
and both cars and caboose left the track,
the cars being thrown crosswise, blocking
the main line.
Wrecking crews were summoned from
Truckee, and the Summit section crew
was ushered into service. Train 4, car
rying European mail, would soon reach
Summit, and tne brakemen labored hero
cly to clear the wreck so as to cause her
little or no damage.
Thomas Casey, a laborer, was working
near one of the large posts which support
the snowsheds when, without a moment's
warning, the huge piece of timber,
loosened by the derailed cars, fell upon
his head, breaking his Bkull and laying
part of the brain bare. Another end of
the post struck two others, an Italian
named Pasquala and an American named
James Haegerty. Both are seriously in
jured, and even should they recover, they
will be disfigured for life. A special train
was dispatched with the unfortunate men
to the railroad hospital at Sacramento.
A telegram received to-day says Casey
died without retraining consciousness.
Pasquuia's wife reached Summit from
her homo In Italy a few hours alter the
accident occurred. She had not seen her
husband for nearly three years, and when
she was apprised of the accident and
realized that he was maimed and scarred
for life she went into hysterics. Attempts
to parity her were of no avail, and she was
6ent to Sacramento on the next train.
The accident did not daunt the workers
who had escaped it. The track was rapidly
cleared and the European mail passed
through on schedule time.
LOS ANGELES MjEX IDLE.
Railway Employes Retired in the Interest
of Economy.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Sept. LâConsid
erable feeling has been aroused here over
the numerous retirements made yesterday
in departments of local railroad circles.
The only explanation vouchsafed so far
for this widespread and unexpected cut
off of employes is that of retrenchment.
The Terminal road has cut its operating
expenses nearly half. The Southern Cali
fornia and the Southern Pacific are em
ploying barely enough men to ieep their
roids in order and their rolling-stock
moving. The shops are thorthanded.
A prominent railroad man said this
morning: "None of the roads have been
making money this summer. In fact, I
believe if the truth were known the rail
roads in Southern California have been

losing money. There is not much likeli
hood of a better condition of things until
after the election, and the roads are forced
to retrenchment. I know that a number
of employes got vacations without salary
rather than be laid off. 1 should not be
surprised if there was another cut at the
end of this month."

INTRENCHED IN SKELETON PASS
Arizona Bandits Are Gathering in Num-
bers Preparatory to Making Another
Bold Raid.
NOGALES, Ariz., Sept. I.â The Nogales
bank raiders have separated since the day
they killed Customs Inspector Frank
Robson in Skeleton Canyon, August 12.
Three went back to Mexico and two re
mained at Skeleton Canyon and vicinity,
where they were joined by more of the
Bang, which is known to consist of fourteen
persons, though but five were concerned
in the attempted banK robbery at Noeales.
United States Marshal Hall of New Mexico
and a posse with two companies of United
States troops are after those robbers who
remained in Skeleton Canyon, and ex-
Sheriff John Slaughter has a posse of ten
picked men after the three who returned
to Mexico. Customs Inspector Sam King,
who returned to Bisbee for ammunition
tor the posse, writes to Collector Webb
from that port as follows:
Bisbkb, A. T., Aug. 81. 1896.
SamC. Webb, Collector of Cuttomsâ Sib: The
robbers, headed by Tom Anderson, are again
In the United States, In Swisshelm Mountains
and are going toward Skeleton Canyon, where
they expect to Join other members of the
gang. Anderson told a friend of mine yester
day that wneii they join the others there will
be ten jnen in the gang, and they expect to
make a haul 6oon, as all are practically
broke. I will meet the posse to-night at San
Bernardino ranch, sixty-five miles from here
and we will take up the trail again to-morrow
morning. The route taken by the robbers is
so rough and rocky and there has been no
much rain that trailing is very difficult. The
robbers gave it out that they are not to be
taken alive. Respectfully, sax King
A well-known mining man arrived late
last night from the Arispe Mining District,
near the Ojo Mountains, He says the
robbers pursued by Slaughter and posse
gave a dance at the Mexicana mine, sixty
five miles from Nogales, last Friday night.
They announced that the dance wa3 given
to celebrate the killing of Robson, one of
the pursuers. All the Mexicans were at the
mine, but one sent word to Slaughter,who
was then ten miles away, but by the time
he reached there the robbers had left for
the United States. If Slaughter overtakes
the gang there will be a lively fight, for
his posse consists of ten of the best gun
fighters in this country.
LORDSBURG, N. Mex., Sept. 1. â The
Deputy United State* Marshals, who have
been leading the troops in the chase after
the postoffice robbers in the Skeleton Can
yon country, came in this evening. They
report that General Wheaton ordered the
troops back to Fort Bayard. Deputy Mar
shal Loomis picked up a couple of cattle
smugglers and brought them in. He in
tends to go back after the outlaws. There
is quite a difference between the action of
the authorities at Washington in iÃ94and in
1896. Two years ago the troops were fairly
forced upon the New Mexico Marshal to
help him guard the railroad property from
the strikers. Now th,ey are grudgingly
allowed to take the field to help arrest
desperate men, and are withdrawn at the
first opportunity.
RESJOXATIOXS AT WHITTIKB.
All of the Old Corps of Attache* Bare
Aou> Withdrawn.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Sept. I.â The
latest report from the State Reform School
atWhittier is that three more resignations
have been tendered to the Board of Trus
tees. One is that of Miss Minnie King,
the bead housekeeper of the institu
tion. Miss King was one of the oldest
officers in line of service in the school,
and will be greatly missed. She is now
tilling the position made vacant by the
retirement of Miss Olmstead as principal,
but will quit the institution. The other
resignations are those of Miss Anna
O'Hara, the tailoress of the school; Miss
Clara Venable, dressmaker, and John
Longfellow, the painter. These, with
former retirements and resignations,
leave the institution minus all of the old
officers.

Will Wage a Vigorous
Campaign.
STANFORD UN IVERSITY, Cal., Sept.
i 1. â The students and professors have al
most all returned from their summer vaca
tion for the university work, which begins
on Friday. There will be about 500 men
in tne freshman clasr this year, and it is
expected that the total enrollment will
reach 1200. Dr. Jordan has not yet re
turned from Alaska, and will not be on
the campus until the 4th of October. He
will immediately leave for the* East to
make the report of the Bering Sea Com
mission, of which he is chairman. Dr.
Stillman will be acting president of the
university in his absence.
Professor Price of the zoology depart
ment and Professor McFarland of the
physiology department have returned from
Europe, where they have been studying
for the past year, and will take the places
of Professors Green and Heath, who go to
Cornell for a year's work. The law de
partment has been strengthened by the
addition of Professor 9. J. Polley, and sev
eral other minor changes have been made
in the faculty.
There is a great deal of excitement
among the students over the coming elec
tion and the political cauldron is boiling
right merrily. Both the McKinley club
and tbe Democratic club are strong in
numbers ana well organized. The Repub
lican organization numbers over 800 mem
bers, with John Marion Switzer president
and William H. Irwin, editor of the Daily
Palo Alto, vice-president. The club is
very active and boasts of a marching corps
of over a hundred members. When Wil
liam J. Bryan spoke to the students la?t
spring he made" many friends and he is
now receiving enthusiastic support. The
campaign at the university will doubtless
be a hot one.
A proposition has been made to the
student body to make one of the days of
the county fair at San Jose, to be held the
latter part of the month, a Stanford day,
as was done at the rose carnival last
spring. The proposition will doubtless be
accepted.
STAFFORD'S MEW COACH.
Cross' Record at Football on Eastern
Gridirons,
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Sept.
I.â Captain Charles M. > Fickert of the
varsity arrived on the campus last night
and is looking over the field to-day to see
what material there is to be developed in
the freshmen and meeting the old men,
almost all of whom are back. The old
players who were seen on the campus to
day are Fickert, Dole, Carl, Cotton, Jeffs,
Thomas, Mclntosh, Freeman, Wilbur and
Soper. The latter two men have been in
training here during the entire summer.
Soper will make a hard try for fullback.
Freeman, the tennis r champion, baseball
man and all-round athlete, will also try
for this position. When Walter Camp
saw Freeman play here last year he pre
â  dieted a football future for him, but it re
mains to be seen whether he will justify
tbe great coach's compliment.
Captain Fickert has not yet got things
into such shape that he can define the
line-up or tell just what material he has
on hand. Talking with a Call corre
spondent to-day he said: "The work of
| tbe men will begin in about three weeks.
I I intend to put the men into the gymna
sium ana take them on long runs for
several days before the practice begins.
So far as I can see now, I think there will
be more men trying for football honors
this year than ever before, and there were
about sixty men last year. I may move
out to tackle this year to make room for
some of the many heavy men who are
candidates for puard.
"Yes, Cross of Yale will be our coach.
He comes recommended by onr old favor
ite, Mr. Camp, and will doubtless be a
good man to put fire into the boys. Mr.
Camp mentioned Cross for a coacn when
we were at Woodside last year, and most
of tne men knew who was to be the coach.
Cross made his reputation as a player
against Stillman, the great Yale center,
and is the only man who ever held Heffle
finger. He will undoubtedly give good
satisfaction as a coach.
"I cannot yet place the men. It has
been suggested oy one of the city papers
that Cotton would play quarter. He likes
this old position at end and will probably
play there. Mclntosh is heavier than
last year, and ought to make a hard fight
for quarter. These are, however, but
speculations; it is too soon to make any
definite statements aa to the positions.
We cannot tell what will develop in the
freshmen or elsewhere. Merit will win on
the varsity, and I shall insist upon a rigid
observance of practice and training rules."

Los Angeles, Cal., Sept. 1. )
At a meeting of the State Executive
Committee of the American Bimetallic
party of California, at 202 North Main
street, this afternoon, the following pre
amble and resolutions were adopted and
ordered mailed to the several bimetallic
and other free silver organizations
throughout California.
Whereas, The true silver Republicans of
California are loyally supporting William J.
Bryan for President of the United States, and
are justly entitled to recognition by every
sincere silver man; therefore, De it
Resolved, That it is the sense of this com
mittee that in the several Senatorial districts
of California, the State Senators to be elected
by the silver electors thereof, should be
pledged, if elected, to use all honorable means
to secure the election of one Democrat and one
Republican to succeed the present members
from California in the Senate of the United
States, and tnat the Senators io elected shall
favor the free and unlimited coinage of full
legal tender silver and gold at the ratio of 16
parts of silver to 1 of gold, without waiting
f Si, or depending upon, the action of any other
natirn.
Whereas, Widespread dissatisfaction exists
against the Democratic nominee for Congress
in the Sixth District, and whereas the Popu
list nominee in said district, Doing in 1892
elected by Democratic voles for Assemblyman,
aided one Thomas V. Cator in a scandal in
volving the election of a Democrat to the
United States Senate; and, whereas, no sin
cere Democrat can vote for Charles A. Barlow
nor true Populist support H. W. Patton, who
Is the protege of the Federal office holders
that in said district desperately sustained the
financial policy of the present Federal ad
ministration until it was repudiated by the
Democracy of the country; therefore, he it
Resolved, That it is the sense of this com
mittee that indignation meetings bÂ© held In
the several counties of said district to protest
against the nomination of said candidates and
emphasize the determination of true silver
electors not to aid the election of a gold
standard Congressman by acceding to the
hasty and ill-advised nomination of said can
didates; and be it farther
Resolved, That the silver Republicans, Demo
crats and Populists of said district, in mass
meeting assembled, should nominate a candi
date for Congress who will command the
faithful support of the free-silver voters of said
district; and be it further
Resolved, That the proper State and Congres
sional district committees of the Democrats
and Populists in said district are hereby re
quested to suspend final action on said nomi
nations until said mass-meeting has been held;
and be it further
Retained, That copies of these resolutions be
mailed to the several silver Republican
leagues and silver organizations of Populists
and Democrat! in said district, and their co
operation is hereby respectfully solicited.

and Hobart Club.
MENLO PARK, Cal., Sept. I.â Never
before in the history of the Republican
party of this place was so much enthusi
asm shown as was manifested at a meeting

signed tho roll are many of the wealthy
residents here, who have promised finan
cial assistance to the organization.- Sev
eral members addressed the club and
raised enthusiasm -to a high pitch. The
meeting to-night assures a big vote fo
McKinley in November.

SEATTLE, Wash., Sept. 1. â United
States Senator Thomas H. Carter of Mon
tana, ex-chairman of the National Repub
lican Committee, arrived in Seattle this
afternoon, being a guest of W. A. Under
wood, general counsel for ex- Receiver Bui- â¢
leigh of the North crn Pacific Railway.
The Montana Senator said his mission here
is one of a private business nature. He
appeared disinclined to talk politics,
though he stated that the chances for
Bryan carrying Montana were "undenia
bly good, as there are counties in the
State, it is claimed, that will hardly give
McKinley a vote."
Though an ardent believer in free
coinage of silver Senator Carter said he
would remain within the Republican
party and support McKinley. He leaves
for his home to-morrow. As to the result
of the National eiectioa Senator Carter
declined to express an opinion.
AS JOSE'S DEMOCRATIC JFEVI>
A Second Club Organized Untter the
Mam* of the Party Leaders.
BAN JOSE, Cal., Sept. l.âA meeting
of the club that was instituted in response
to a call that was issued by the Demo
cratic Central Committee was held this
evening.
A report was received from the com
mittee on permanent organization and the
following permanent officers were elected â¢
President, T. A. Carroll; secretary, A. L."
Veuve; assistant secretary, Thomas Min
ahan; treasurer, R. j. Langford ;
sergeant -at - arms, Dennis McCartv
executive committee, C. M. Hatcher'
Alexander J Hart, G. Peirano, James
Tborpe, S. N. Rucker. Vice-presidents
were appointed to represent the various
townships, and arrangements were made
tor a similar club organization throughout
the county.
The committee on organization sug
gested that the club be called the Demo
cratic County Central Club. W. H.
Dwyer opposed this name, because of the
fact, as he stated, that another clnb had
been organized in Saa Jose and had ap- '
propriated that name. The club referred
to was that of which Leo B. Archer was
president and J. E. O'Conner secretary.
It was suggested by W. H. Dwyer that
the club should be named the Bryan and
Sewall Club of Santa Clara County. T. C.
Hogan strongly favored this. He said he
was opposed to the adoption of any name
that would in any manner cause the
club to be associated in the public mind
with the opposition organization.
"That so-called Democratic Club," said
Hogan, "is composed of men who are no
more Democrats than they are Prohibi
tionists. This club sbould not affiliate
with them in any way. They are men
who ro around every campaign with
long knives in their boots, ready to
use them upon any candidate who
refuses to give them promises of
fat positions, or who, after election, fail to
keep alleged promises to them. They are
always prepared to knife every man upon
the ticket, :tt any time, upon any pretext.
As I said before, we should not adopt any
name that would be liable to associate us
in any way in the public mind with that
organization. lam in favor of adopting
the name of the Bryan and Sewall Club of
Sarta Clara County."
This name was then adopted,, by a unan
imous vote. The following committee
was appointed to arrange for a meeting to
ratify the National ticket: S. IJ. Rucker,
Martin Murphy, T. C. Hogan, W. H.
Dwyer and T. A. Carroll. Â°The committee
was instructed to secure, if possible, D. M.
Delmas as a speaker.

morning, and Senator Dubois and party,
including members of the State Demo
cratic Advisory Board and J. G. Johnson,
of the Democratic committee, departed for
Boise City, to confer with the Populist
Central Committee.
Notning whatever was accomplished
here, the Democratic committee having
decided to see what action the Populists
would take at the meeting here. It wag
the desire to unite the silver forcea, irre
spective of party, but unless the Populists
would consent to undo the work of the
Boise convention the Democrats were pow
erless.
It is the desire of the Dubois faction to
have regular Democratic- Popuiist nomi
nees. Quarles of Lemhi County for Su
rreme Justice, and Storer of Bineham
County for Treasurer, withdrew, and Ed
ward Wilson and Tim Regan, irom the
ranks of silver Republicans, were placed in
their stead, but this would- not be listened
by the other parties. It is not likely that
any plan of fusion will be agreed upon.

in the 2:25 pace, and Twilight carried off
the laurels in the 2:40 trot.
The defeat of Pa lita, crack daughter of
the dead warrior Palo Alto, was the sensa
tion of the day. Tbe filly, which, was en
tered by the PÂ»'o Alto stock farm, gained
a record of 2:16 as a two-year-old, and the
big breeding establishment's superintend
ent, Frank Covey, confidently expected
to trot down near 2:10 to-day, which opin
ion wap shared by Drivers Dustin and
Phippen. A prohibitive favorite in the
pools, selling for $20 with the other two
starters, Don Roberto and Sweet Rose,
bringing but $7. she took the first two
heats from Don Roberto in 2:25^â2:26^.
She captured the second heat with lit
tle to spare and the following heat
could dD no better than finish third.
In each of these heats the ribbons
had been held by Jo n Phippen, but in
the fourth beat James Dustin sat in the
bike, her apparent distressed condition
being inexplicable to Manager Covey. In
the fourth tieat she Â»gain finished third in
slow time, and in the succeeding heat was
eased up over a fnrlong irora the wire and
logged in. The filly was then allowed to
be drawn by the judges, and upon exami
nation by two veterinary sur.eons the
daughter of Palo Alto was pronounced to
be suffering from a rupture of the envelope
of tbe heart, and it was simply miracu
lous that she did not fall dead on the
track.
It is an ill wind, though, that blows no
body good. The last three heats were
taken off the reel in 2:30, 2:28^ and 2:34VÂ£
by Sweet Rose, owned and driven by the
veteran driver, "Tom" Smith. Smith is
not overburdened with this world's goods,
and the victory ot his filly was a very pop
ular one, the gray-haired horseman beinpr
the recipient of quite an ovation. Walter
Maben made a bold bid for the rich stake
with Don Roberto, but the Sidney colt's
recent illness prevented him from making
a very strong argument.
Driver Tommy Keating continued his
all-conquering career with Billy G in the
2:25 pace. A field of seven "side-wind
ers" lined up, with the Keating & Win
phi p representative bringing $10, Nellie B
$9 and the field $3. In the first heat Keat
ing ;ook the pole from Palatine with the
favorite after passing thÂ« half, and, never
pressed, won the heat with ease in 2:16.
Dictatus was second and Beach wood third.
The first choice experienced no difficulty
in taking the next two teatsand race in
2:l6}^ and 2:20. Nellie B was not on her
besÂ» behavior, breaking quite often, to her
backers' disgust.
The win of Twilight in the 2:40 trot was
another popular one. There were eight
ptaners, with the field celling favorite at
$10, Twilight going for $6 and the field $4.
Dennis Gannon held the reins over his
mare and placed the race to his credit in
straight heat?, the time for each heat be
ing 2:20& In the first heat Goldy wa*
the contending horse, and in the following
two the sturdy little Peter Jackson gave
the winner a bard rub.

Â«om2aitieÂ« $Â©-<3ay Received -ft l>iÂ£ts? i
from H. Pembroke of San Francisco, |
in which Pembroke assured Grunsky that I
great interest was being taken in the re- ]
gatta, and that the South End crew had
lengthened its stroke and was pulling in |
better form than ever. The Pioneers,
according to him, have decided to row the
race of their lives and even up old sore
with the South Ends.
The Ariel crew is in training, and Pem
broke advises the Giants of Stockton to
train faithfully if they expect to put the
nose of their barge across the line first in
the senior barge event.
In the senior outrigger skiff event there
will be six entries, and the veteran Pem
broke says it will be the last race he will
ever row in. William Coe of the Uni
versity of California will be one of the
participants in the junior race for outrig
ger skiffs.
There has been some difficulty between
the committee here and that in San Fran
cisco over the placing in tne programme
of tne senior barge race. The committee
here want it to be the last event on the
programme, as otherwise it will draw
largely from the bicycle races at Goodwater
Grove.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^H
The committee in San Francisco placed
it third on tbe list of events, but it is be
lieved that it will accede to the request of
the committee here when it learns lo what
extent this arrangement would interfere
with the receipts at the bicycle meet.

plucky young Portlanders.

VISITED THE LEPERS.
Father Conradi of the Sandwich Islands
Makes a Tour or Inspection of
the Pesthouse.
Father Conradi, whose devotion to the
welfare of the lepers in the Hawaiian Is
lands has made him beloved there and
well known the worid over, paid a visit to
the pesthouse yesterday to look over the
institution and examine into the condition
of the patients confined there.
He was particularly interested in the
white men at the institution, and be
asked them many questions as to their
treatment and also as to the effect of tbe
Goto cure for leprosy, which all are taking
at the present time.
AN INCORRIG IBLE BOY.
Willie Smith, Who Was Studying to Be
a Desperado, Is Arrested.
Willie Smith is 16 years of age, but he
looks more like 10. His mother lives at
211 State street, and she had him arrested
for vagrancy. He appeared beiore Judge
Campbell yesterday mornine, and his
mother ?aid she wanted him sent to the
Whittier Reform School, as he was a bad
boy. who ran away from home and refused
to bo to school. She was a widow, and had
no means of making him behave himself.
He spent his time reading dime novis,
and when arrested, three lurid publica
tions, a revolver and package of cigarettes
were found in his pockets.
Judge Campbell said he was sorry he
could not send Willie to tne Reform School
on a charge of vagrancy, and Mrs. Smitn
remembered that Willie, while she was
correcting him with a piece of wood in the
yard, seized a hatchet and tried to strike
her with it. The Judge advised her to
swear to a complaint charging Willie with
assault with a deadly weapon, and then he
would send him to the school. The com
plaint was sworn to, and Willie was booked
on the charge.

retary Haskins not later than September 21. It
was first intended to hold this examination
in March, 1897, but the limited number of
aval able men has caused an entire change of
programme.

BIDS FOR THE ROOF.
New Tenders Opened by the Board of
New City Hall Commissioners
Yesterday.
The Board of New City Hall Commis
sioners opened bids yesterday for the con
struction of the City Hall roof under the
modified plans prepared by the architect.
The original bids were altogether too
high for the means at the command of the
commission, and wer*> rejected. They ran
irom $224,000 down to $178,000. Under the
modified plans it was expected the bids
would range from $30,000 to $60,000 lower,
and this belief was justified by the result,
the highest bid being $178,000 and the low
est, that of John J. O'Brien, about $129,
-000.
The bids will be acted on at tbe next
regular meeting.
SUED FOE MAINTENANCE.
Kenjamln F. Hurlclsnn Asked to Sup
port a Woman He Is Said to Have
Deserted.
Benjamin F. Hudelson has been sued
for maintenance by Millie Hudelson.
The complaint alleges that the parties

i.i in receipt of an income of over $250 per
month, wherefore is asked $125 per month
for the permanent support and mainten
ance of the plaintiff, and $500 for counsel
fe-s.
Reel B. Terry, who is counsel for the
plaintiff, says that his client was tbe
keeper of a notorious resort at the time
she married the defendant and went
under the name of Cora Webster. He says
that the marriage was one made by verbal

rOB PBESIDENT
WILLIAM McKINLEY, of Ohio
FOB TICK-PRESIDENTâ
GARRET A. HOBART, of New Jersey
ELKCTION NOVEMBER 3. 1896.
Everything is now open.
The State Fair is drawing crowds.
There is music in the air all over the
country.
Vermont has led the way and the Union
will follow.
Teller called it a defense, but it sounded
like an apology.
The Mechanics' Institute makes a home
show to be proud of.
Tbe campaign has begun to show the
rise of the tidal wave.
The Indianapolis convention claims at
tention for a little while.
He who would keep up with the pro
cession now must be lively.
If you expect any profit from home in
dustry why not vote for home industry?
California needs protection and the
cause of protection needs the vote of Cali
fornia.
Everything is open but the mills, and
they will open up with the election of
McKinley.
Bryan is beginning to wish his friends
had not thrown the stalwarts down so hard
at Chicago.
Go to the Mechanics' Pavilion and see
what California industry can do if it has a
living showing.
The campaign of education is wide open
now and all may enter it whose minds are
open to conviction.
All that is needed for victory in Cali
fornia is harmony in the rants and the
silencing of the kickers.
To the mind of an extremist the two
most incomprehensible things are com
mon-sense and international bimetallism.
In reading Senator Teller's defense all
genuine bimetallists will regret he ever
got himself in a position where defense is
needed.
The more the Democrats dodge the tariff
the more the people study it, and that is
where the joke comes in that makes the
situation amusing.
The Indianapolis convention can hardly
hoDe to do much, for it will have to in
dorse Cleveland, and that in itself will be
a sufficient hoodoo to kill the ticket.
The Republican party aims to give every
American an opportunity to labor and in
tends that every laborer shall have good
wages paid for in ihe best money in the
world.
A few free-trade Democrats may vote
for the ticket to be put up at Indianapolis,
but most conservative men of the party
will take no chances and give an honest
vote for McKinley and Hobart.
Altgeld has been charged by ex-Con
gressman Forman with corrupt practices
in the management of State funds, and as
a consequence he is not feeling so aggres
sive as he did a little while ago.
The stalwart Democrats who meet at
Indianapolis to-day do not know whether
they are saving their political lives or
committing suicide, but they do know
that anything is better than Bryanism.
Had he remained in the Republican
party Senator Teller could have been
largely instrumental in aiding McKinley
to promote the free coinage of silver by
international agreement; but as it is he
will hardly count for more than an ex
ploded cartridge.
Each succeeding year sees some im
provement in the State fair, and this will
be no exception to the rule, but the years
should not be alone in seeing the improve
ment; the people also should see them,
particularly San Franciscans, who ought
to keep posted on what the rural indus
tries of the State produce.
Thomas J. Elderkin. secretary of the
Seamen's Union, is reported to have said
in a recent speech in Chicago that nowhere
were seamen so poorly paid as on the
vessels owned by Sewali, tne man who is
now beine supported for the Vice-Presi
dency by demagogues who profess to be
the devoted and self-sacrificing friends of
workingmen.
In addressing at Ashtabula an audience
â¢aid to consist of 8000 persons Bryan asked
all Republicans who intended to vote for
him to nold up their bands, and it is re
ported that some thirty persons did so.
This is the extentof Republican defection,
thirty in a crowd of 8000, while Democratic
defection among conservative men would
show in an equal crowd fully 16,000 hands.
VERMONT AND VICTORY.
The news from Vermont this morning
will send a thrill of cheer through all Re
publican hearts in the Union. Her vote
shows that the tidal wave for protection,
patriotism and prosperity is mounting to
even a higher level than was reached in
1894, when the free-trade Congress was
swept from power ana the party that sup
ported it was overwhelmed throughout
the country.
Political experts have noted that when
the Republican majority in the State
election in Vermont preceding a Presi
dential election exceeds 25,000 the Repub
licans carry the Union and elect their
President. When it has fallen below that
amount the Democrats have won. The
State election is therefore always noted
with interest because the vote affords a
good basis for calculating the vote to be
cast in November. This year but little
calculation will be needed. Vermont has
gone almost solid for protection and
sound money and led the way to victory.
In the East all is over but the shouting.
On this coast harmony and organization
are all that are needed to bring about the
same assurance of Republican success.
That harmony certainly will not be
lacking from this time on. The vote of
Vermont, while it cheers the hearts of the
loyal, is also a challenge to California
Republicans to rise to tha occasion
and sweep the fusion ticket into
utter confusion. In every section of
California there Bhould be a com
plete union of all the friends of
sound finance in opposition to the com
binations that have been made against it.
Vermont has led the way; Maine *?ill
follow before the month closes, and in
November California will stand with them
for McKinley and prosperity.
The best plan that suggests itself to my
mind is that ue should go back to the teach
ings of our fathers, and that we should restore
tlie old {incriminating duties; that we should
impose a tax of 10 per cent ad valorem in ad
dition to whatever tax is imposed by law on
all goods, wares and merchandise imported
into the United States in vessels not of the
United States. It seems to me that this would
settle the question upon the best possible basis
and in time revive and restore our shipping. â
Hon. Stephen B. Elkins, United States Sena
tor of West Virginia.
"DISTURBING BUSINESS."
,
We renew and emphasize our allegiance to
the policy of protection as the bulwark of
American industrial independence and the
foundation of American development and
prosperity. We denounce the present Demo
cratic tariff as sectional, injurious to the pub
lic credit and destructive to business enter
prise.âRepublican Rational Platform.
"We denounce as disturbing to business
the Republican threat to restore the Mc-
Kinley bill."â Bryan's platform.
Let us see which of these two declara
tions history justifies. During the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1891. we exported
agricultural products amounting to $642 -
751,344, and $799,328,232 during the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1892. "McKinley
ism" prevailed in those two years.
During the fiscal year ending June 30,
1895, we exported ngricultural products
amounting to $553,210,026, and $559,841,714
in the year ending June 30, 1896. Tne
Wilson-Gorman act was in operation dur
ing these years, and the decrease, which
the agriculturists of this country sus
tained, amounted to $319,028,367. The
McKinley bill did not "disturb" farmers
very much, did it? Unless it disturbed
them to get nearly $320,000,000 more for
their produce in two years under the Mc-
Kinley "robber tariff" than they got in
two years under Bryanism.
But farmers are not the only persons
who were "disturbed" by tlie McKinley
bill. No one escaped its "disturbing"
influence. For instance, during the first
twenty-three months of the operation of
the McKinley act the bank clearings aggre
gated $111,979,642,300.
During the same number of months un
der Bryanism the bank clearings amounted
to $98,702,777,786, or f13,186.5G4.604 less
than during the months when the Mc-
Kinley bill was disturbing business.
Thirteen billion dollars is a good deal of
money, and that is the sum of the reople's
loss on business represented in bank clear
ing-house transactions which cover less
than 50 per cent of tlie country's total
volume of business. There has been an
average decrease of more than half a
billion dollars a month since the repeal
of McKinley's "disturbing" law.
Those who are well acquainted with the
character of American business men would
not hesitate to say that they rather like
to be "dipturbed" just the way the Mc-
Kinley act disturbed them, and it is
equally safe to say that they are getting
impatient for November to come so they
may put public concerns in shape to be
disturbed agair> after the fashion of the
McKinley way of "disturbing" business.
But perhaps the Bryans, the Altgekls aud
the Tillmans believe that the poorer the
people are the easier they will be to han
dle, and hence they advocate free trade
and cheap money.
To the 75,000,000 people which male up the
great Republic tlie opportunity to labor
means more than to all the world besides. It
means the development of resources great
beyond the comprehension of any mortal and
the diffusion among all of riches to which the
glories of the " Arabian Nig hU" arc but the

sheen of all the jewels of this earth are but
the gleam of the glowworm in the pallor of

CIVIL LIBERTY ATTACKED.
"In my opinion," said ex-President Har
rison in his New York speech last week,
"there is no issue presented by the Chica-o
convention more important or vital than
the question they have raised of prostitut
ing tbe power and duty of the National
courts and National executive. The de
fense of the constitution, of the Supreme
Court of the United States and of the Presi
dent's power and duty to enforce all of tlie
laws of the United States without await
ing the call or consent of the Governor of
any State is an important and living issue
in this campaign."
It would matter very little to the people
of this country whether they have free
trade or protection, bimetallism or mono
metallism, paper money or metallic
money, if the courts were made subser
vient to the schemes of professional poli
ticians and economic experimentalists.
The soul of the power that maintains
civil liberty in the United States is
in the court of final appeal, and in pro
portion as that court is prostituted for po
litical or social advantage is its power to
protect the individual in the enjoyment
of his liberty weakened. If the personnel
of a court may be changed at the will
and pleasure of party or clan, either
by increasing its numbers or by legis
lation to strengthen the bold of that

party upon the machinery of govern"
ment, the court may also be required to
render decisions that are in harmony
with the purpose of the powers that be
without reference to the constitution or
legislative enactments. Can one conceive
how the liberty of tbe people could be put
in greater jeopardy than such a system of
jurisprudence would place it?
The wording of the Jiryan declaration,
or Chicago platform, on the question of
tampering with the functions and per
sonnel of the Supreme Court of the Na
tion is adroit and weir calculated to de
ceive the casual reader, but the under
lying purpose is to revamp and reorganize
the highest judicial authority in the land
so that decisions may be secured whicn
will comport with such theories of govern
ment as are advocated by Altgeld, who, as
the Governor of Illinois, released from the
penitentiary the Haymarket bomb
throwers and officially censured the trial
court for inflicting punishment upon
them; with such theories of government
as are held by Bryan, who preaches the
doctrine of blood, of war, of brother
against brother and section against sec
tion, and witn such theories of govern
ment as are held by Tillman of South
Carolina, who rejoices when fear and
calamity come upon the North because it
refused to acquiesce in South Carolina's
treasonable purpose in 1861.
The revolutionists who controlled the
Chicago convention know that so long as
the courts stand between their purpose
and the liberty of the people their efforts
to overthrow the Government will avail
them nothing, and bence it is that they
propose to have courts that will aid and
abet them. The silver question wiih them
is an issue to agitate the people and at the
same time draw public attention from
their ulterior object, and when they say
the free coinage of silver independent of
those whom we have trade relations with
would be followed by "good times" they
err and they know it, but the end with
such men justifies the means, and the end
is disorganized society and a government
conducted on lines that are in harmony
with Altgeld's denunciation of tbe courts
for punishing crime. With tbe courts
under the thumb of the Bryans, the Ait
gelds and tbe Tillmans, the law would be
made to accommodate itself to the wishes
of these revolutionisst. Then civil liberty
would wear Bryan's crown of thorns, and
finally it would be crucified upon his cross
of sectionalism an d class hatred.
Whatever dollars we have in this country
must be good dollars, as good in tlie hands of
the poor as the rich ; equal dollars; equal in
inherent merit, equal in purchasing power,
whether they be pa per dollars or gold dollars
or silver dollars or treasury notes; each con
vertible into the other and each exchangeable
for the other, because each is based upon
equal value and has behind it equal security;
good, not by the fiat of law alone, but good
because the whole commercial world recog
nizes their inherent and inextinguishable
value. â McKin ley .
A DEMOCRAT'S ADVICE.
Hon. Edward J. Phelps of Vermont,
who was Minister to England during
President Cleveland's first administration,
is out in a ringing letter in support of
Major McKinley's candidacy. Mr. Phelps
does not wish to bo understood as having
abandoned the principles and traditions
of his party, but he regards, as he says,
"thÂ£ pending Presidential election as pre
seiwing the most dangerous crisis that
this country has ever encountered. It
does not, in my judgment, involve any
political controversy nor any question of
the supremacy of party, for such consid
erations are lost sicht of in the far greater
gravity of the situation."
Mr. Phelps believes it the duty of all
patriotic men to lay aside party pride and
join as one man in the work of saving tbe
country from the clutches of Bryanism.
He does not see that there can be any
middle ground between a friend and a foe
of the country for a patriotic man to stand
upon. He believes the attack of tbe
Bryans "is not upon the policy but upon
the life of the Nation." Referring to the
attempt of Bryan to set the masses against
the "rich," Mr. Phelps says those "who
are independently rich are very few in
proportion to the 70,000,000 of American
people, the vast majority of whom gain
their living by-some form or otner of use
ful employment. Even the rich are de
pendent upon the business of the country,
for their wealth chiefly consists in invest
ments in its various industries, and must
speedily perish when they are extin
guished. That there should be prosperity
in some of these employments and not in
others, or among one class of people and
not among others, is impossible, for they
all rest upon a common foundation and
are affected by the same considerations."
Mr. Phelps sees much danger to the
peopie in Bryan's candidacyâ not because
it is William Jennings Bryan, but because
he is advocating principles of government
so antagonistic to the spirit of our institu
tions that were they to prevail the Nation
would very soon reach political, social and
commercial chaos, and therefore he ear
nestly pleads with his fellow-Democrats to
forget party and party organization for
the moment and join with those in whose
hands the rights and liberties of the peo
ple would be safe, notwithstanding they
differ widely with Democrats on certain
economic theories and governmental prac
tices. No doubt Mr. Phelps' letter will
exert a great influence throughout the
Kasf, and it will be felt in the West and
South as well.
You might just as well understand now
that you cannot add value to anything by
diminishing the measure of the value with
which the thing is sold or exchanged. If you
can increase the value by lowering the measure
of value, and you want to benefit the farmer,
free coinage isn't the way to do ft. The way
to do that is to make the bushel smaller, the
pound lighter and declare a legal dozen lest
than twelve.â William McKinley.
TURKISH BRUTALITY.
Great Britain appears to be getting
ready to do what she thould have done
fifty years ago. The Mediterranean squad
rons, which is composed of a dozen or
more warships., have been ordered :o the
Levant, presumably to apply the heroic
remedy to the "sicfc man of Europe." The
massacre of 4000 Armenians in the city of
Constantinople in two days is arousing a
feeling of so much bitterness against the
Sultan all over the Christian world that it
does not appear bow tbe powers can
longer tolerate tbe Turkish empire to
exist.
The evidence is pretty clear that the
Porte has been secretly urging the slaugh
ter of Christians for a year or more,
although he has appeared to deplore the
existence of trouble among hia subjects.
No doubt be is tbe champion villain of tbe
nineteenth century, and unless England
leads in the good work of dismembering
his empire, she will forfeit the respect of
all civilized people. But sending a large
fleet to Turkish waters looks very much
as if the London Government had at
last concluded to make war upon the
Sultan, if need be. to put a stop to his
atrocious treatment of the subjects of his
country.
For half a century the Sultans of Tur
key have felt secure to butcher Christians
at their pleasure because the powers could
not afford to dismember the empire, or
rather because the powers could not agree
upon a division of the territory belonging
to Turkey. Of course tne powers are mor
ally responsible for the slaughter of the
thousands of Christians by Turkish sol
diers, and, no doubt, too, had the Sultan
been a little more moderate and caused
fewer murders last week, a British fleet of
warships would not now be sailing to
Turkish waters; but perhaps just such a
brutal and wholesale killing as has been
witnessed in the laÂ«t few days was neces
sary to drive the powers into war with the
fcfcissulman brutes. Think of 4000 buman
beings butchered in the streets of a Eu
ropean city in the year 1896, simply to Bat
isfy the cravings of a brutal Turk for
Christian blood !

LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
INTERNATIONAL BIMETALLISM.
A Review or J. Asburt Johnson's Recent
Letter on thb Subject.
Mr. J. Asbury Johnson, Populist, seems to be
somewhat confused, or wants to confuse
others, in regard to the construction of inter
national bimetallism by the Republican party.
There is no doubt about the simple b -ing able
to confound the wise when it comes to asking
questions. I don't expect to satisfy the gen
tleman, but to say something for the benefit of
the honest and well-meaning voter.
It seems to be the principal argument of
gold and silver monometallists to charge the
advocates of bimetallism by international
agreement with sinister motives. Monometal
lic ts are opposed to bimetallism. The gold
men do not disguise tne fact.
Able advocates of free silver coinage at the
ratio of 16 to 1 admit that the country may go
to a s'lver basis if their theory prevails. Ko it
is reasonable to infer that both of these theo
rists believe that an international agreement
or even bimetallism is an "iridescent dream."
Your correspondent maybe of that number.
He even states that all the European govern
ments stand committed against it. That is
true; but there is a strong sentiment in Ger
many, France and England in favor of it and
this sentiment is growing.
Now there is one point that the two wings of
monometallists agree upon, and that is not to
depart one hair's breadth from their particu
lar theories.
The gold men say that the commercial ratio
between the metals cannot be departed from
while the silver contingent will not agree to
any other ratio except 16 to 1. Bimeiallista
on the other hand contend that if some inter
mediate point between 16 aud 30 could be
agreed upon, and that ratio maintained
awhile, then 16 to 1 could be reached and sus
tained. If a man cannot lift 150 pounds it is
evident he cannot lift 200 pounds. What
seems to worry Mr. Johnson is whether Major
McKinley is in favor of 16 to 1 or some other
ratio. He does not state, and it is not neces
sary. He is willing to leave that to tbe judg
ment and wisdom of the members comprising
a conference appointed to agree upon a ratio.
Mr Johnson seems to think that if a ratio of
20 to 1 should be agreed upon it would make
but little difference to the pensioner or
laborer. I think it would make considerable
difference â a difference that the laborer could
certainly see and a probability that the ratio
could finally be established at 16 to 1 when
the loss would be nothing. A. J. Dill.

A Right to Voteâ R. E. H., atockton, Cal. If
"in the early days a teamster who went
through the country could vote for Presi
dential Electors wherever he hapnened to be
on election day by presenting a certificate
showing that he was registered in some place
in the State," no teamster can do so now. _ A
voter can vote only in the precinct in which
he is legally registered.
A Guardianâ Miss Benicia X., City. The
matter of appointing a guardian for a person
who is said to be incompetent is one that rests
in, the discretion of the court before whom the
application is made, after a hearing of the

valid objection presented, is undoubtedly the
proper person to appoint.

which you purchased for 54 cents. The price
of Mexican dollars in this market is regulated
by the price of silver and ranges at this time
from 51 to 54 cents.

terday When the California Powder Works Blew Up. The

Over as Though in a Heavy Gale.
Point the California Powder Works blew
np. For an instant the powerful towboat
quivered and almost came to a standstill
while the big ship heeled over from the
force of the concuasion. Shortly after
ward there was a second explosion and
then a number of slighter detonations fol
lowed.
"I newer saw anything like it in all my
life," said Captain Dan Haskell of the tug
Fearless. "The explosion was terrific in
its force and the flame shot a hundred feet
into the air. Then the smoke and vapor
spread out until it looked like a gigantic
umbrella, the handle being the thin col
umn of smoke that connected the earth
with the covering. ThÂ« second explosion
was not as bad as the first, and it seemed
to spread right from the ground. Imme
diately afterward there was a third, and
then we heard several light ones as we
steamed along. By the aid of glasses I
saw a number of houses in ruins, and I
guessed from that that the loss of life
would be considerable."
The John Ena is one of the handsomest
ships in port to-day. She is named after
a well-known Hawaiian planter and is
owned principally in Honolulu and San
Francisco. The shares were placed at $90
each and in consequence there are more
people interested in the vessel than in any
other that comes to this port. She will
dock at the seawall to-day and will take
in stiffening for Puget Sound. At Tacoma
she will load lumber for Port Piri, in Aus
tralia.
The bark Theobald sails to-day for Coal
Bay, Alaska. She will take up twenty
miners to reinforce the gang already there
and the vessel will bring back about 2000
tons of the black diamonds. This will be
the second trip of the bark to the mines. On
the last occasion she brought down 800
tons of coal and it proved of such quality
and sold so readily that the owners have
determined to develop the property. Over
120,000 tons of coal will be sold in Alaska
this year. All ihe canneries and Govern
ment vessels, the Treadwell mines and the
mines of the Alaska Commercial Com
pany will be supplied and bitka and
Juneau will be reeular customers. Captain
Swan of the Theobald, who is well in
formed about Coal Bay and its vicinity,
says the mine is one of the most promis
ing 'in Alaska.
The steamer Jennie got back from Cooks
Inlet yesterday. Captain Esser says that
there are over 3000 mii:ers on the beach
and that nearly all are destitute. The only
vessel to return from the Inlet before win
ter is the Dora and she has only accommo
dations for 150. If help is not sent before
winter sets in Captain Esser says the suf
ferings of the miners will be awful and
the deaths many. All the salmon fleet
had got away when the Jennie left. The
last to get away was the Prussia and she
had 35.000 cases aboard.
The Occidental and Oriental Company's
Gaelic, that went ashore on the coast of

The Harbor Commissioners decided yes
terday to light the clock in the new post
office at the foot of Market street. Chief
Engineer Holmes told the board that as
soon as it was ascertained what the post
oilice officials wanted in the shape of light

A light in the clock tower will be a great
boon to people who have to catch the late

tension of ninety days on its contract for
the ironwork on the depot. It was pointed
out that the company was delayed owing
to a clerical error in the plans, but tbe
Commissioners decided the delay would
not reach ninety days and laid the matter
over for consideration.
Oscar Lewis and Mahoney Bros., bonds
men for the late A. Paiee Brown, asked
tnat the matter of rectifying the error in
the plans go over until to-morrow. They
wanted to make tbe best possible term's
with the Risdon Iron Works in order to
protect Mrs. Brown. "If we can't get the
work done at a reasonable figure," said
Mr. Mahoney, "we will doit ourselves."
The matter was laid over as desired.
The contract for supplying lumber to

was let to the Slade Lumber Company at
$13 a thousand. The price paid for the
last six months was $11 a thousand.
Architect Swain's specifications for tbe

the depot was not accepted. The Com
missioners thought the figures too high
and returned them to the architect for re
vision.

then attached to it and at the other end of
the rope was a buoy. This was done in
order to locate the sack in the event of the
launch capsizing.

The board of directors of the Manufac

Fred H. Dingle was discussed and the ex
pert accountant reported that the total
amount stolen was $899 45. Dingle's
mother asked the directors not to press
the charge against her son, whose case
comes up In the Police Court for examina
tion to-day.
After she bad retired the directors de
cided not to interfere with the course of
justice, but let the officers of the law pros
ecute Dingle the same as any other crim
inal. At present there are two charges
against Dingle.felonoiusand misdemeanor
embezzlement.
The directors further decided that they
will make good the shortage pro rata in

money will all be made up.

The Cafe Zlnkand Will Celebrate Its
First Anniversary.
It is just a year ago to-day that the Cafe
Zinkand first threw its doors open to the
public. The career of the establishment
since that date has been one of continued
success, and it is the intention of the pro
prietor to make to-day a remarkable oc
casion to the patrons of the house. To
this end a most elaborate bill of fare
has been prepared, and those who are
fortunate enough to visit the house to-day
will find a menu to choose from that in
variety cannot be excelled anywhere in
the land.
During the year that thÂ« houÂ»Â« has been
catenni; to the people of San Francisco it
has enjoyed a patronage seldom accorded
to any establishment of the kind. Its
patrons have been served well, the bill of
fare always includes every delicacy in the
market, while in the matter of wines no
restaurant, even in the great cities of
Europe, can offer a greater variety of the
choicest vintages known in the worla.
Tc-day's menu, while elaborate will
only go to si)ow the ability of the pro
prietor to furnish a meal fit for an im
perial household, and it will serve to in
spire on the part of the visitors to the
house to-day a desire to become perma
nent patrons of a cafe where the most
tempting and toothsome viands can ever
be had, cooked aud served in regal style.

AN INSTITUTE
OF HYPNOTISM,
School Where Doctors Are
Taught to Put Patients
to Sleep.
MANY EAGER TO LEARN
The Mystery of Mental Sugges
tion Applied to Thera
peutics.
JOURNEYS IN THE MIND.
A Boy in Stockton "Who Saw a Woman
in Jo'iet Writing a
Letter.
"The Hypnotic and Mesmeric Institute"
is the latest thing in San Francisco educa
tional circles. It is conducted by J. B.
Earley and E. J. Pause, professors of the
hypnotic art, and has Deen open for the
reception of pupils less ttian two weeks.
That the interest in the mystery of mes
merism and hypnotism is very general is
manifested by the great number who daily
knock at the doors of the institute.
Professor Earley is a pupil of Professor
Bernheim, acknowledged to be the head
and front of scientific hypnotism. With
Mr. Pause, he has traveled over a large
part of this country to finally locate per
manently in this City.
"The purpose of the institute," said Mr.
Pause yesterday, "is to teach hypnotism
on scientific lines for scientific uses. Our
pupils everywhere have come from the
ranks of physicians, dentists and minis
ters, for it is to that class alone that our
methods appeal.
"Ministers? Oh, yes; the better the
hypnotist the more successful the preacher.
Successful preachinK*is hypnotism. The
Salvation Army works through the agency
of hypnotism, though its soldiers may not
know or realize it. Over at Beulah Park
we have recent reports of how men and
women were actually thrown into the
cataleptic state, standing with arms ex
tended for hours, just as is done with the
subjects of exhibition hypnotists on the
stage. The successful salesman is a hyp
notist in a small way. You ask him for a
piece of blue cloth, and, having no blue,
he makes you believe you want brown.
You get home, away from bis influence,
and you wonder how you were persuaded.
"It is not fashionable any more not to
beleive in hypnotism. Its wonders are of
too common knowledge. Men of science
recognize its uses and employ it more
and more. I do not believe that men
should be permitted to practice hypno
tism indiscriminately â on the stige for in
stance. It should be limited to thera
peutic purposes.
"Do I know what hypnotism is? No
body knows that. know how it is
produced and something of its effects; we
do not know what it is any more than Mr.
Edison knows what electricity is.
"There are a good many false notions
abroad concerning hypnotism, 1 ' continue d
Mr. Pause. "In the first place it is an
error to suppose that to be hppnotized is a
sign of weakness mentally. The contrary
is true. To be sure, a man of strong will
can successfully resist the influence if he
desires. In fact, persons cannot be hyp
notized against their will. They must at
least be negative to the influence if they
do not assent. But, on the other hand,
an insane or even a feeble-minded person
is most difficult to influence. It is neces
sary to gain the attention of the subject
for the best and quickest results.
"At Stockton recently we experimented
considerably in the insane asylum. Many
of the attempts upon the insane were
fruitless. One young girl, a victim of epi
lepsy, was brought under the influence
only with great difficulty, but after sev
eral treatments her trouble was much re
lieved. She had had an average of ten
fits a day. When we left there she had
but one a day. No, a healthy person lends
himself to the influence more readily than
a sick one; an intelligent mind more read
ily than a weak one. Professor Wilson at
Santa Cruz submitted himself to a test
and fell under the influence instantly.
"Ihe different stages or states of hypno
tism? Well, there is first merely the
lethargic state in which the brain is more
or less conscious. Then there is the cata
leptic, where the muscles of the subject
become rigid. Then there is the active
somnambulistic state in which mental
suggestion is followed. It is in this state
that the surgeon may do his work with no
pain to the subject. The practitioner says
to the subject, for instance, 'You are now
enjoying the luxury of a Turkish bath.'
He may then cut the subject's leg off
while he, the subject, is feeling the pleas
ure of his Dath. Then there is the clair
voyant state in which the mind does won
derful and mysterious feats. You may be
a skeptic in the matter of ciairvoyancy.
So once was I. I have a letter just now
from a physician in Stockton, a pupil of
ours, who tells that through the clairvoy
ant power he has learned things of great
value to him.
"An incident of his instruction will
illustrate the power. We threw a little
newsboy into the clairvoyant state in our
rooms in this doctor's presence and told
him to make a test. He said to the boy,
'I want you to go with me to my old home
in Joliet, 111.' 'Very well,' said the boy;
'I'm there.' The doctor asked him to de
scribe the place, and he did perfectly.
Then the doctor said: 'Let us go into the
house. What do you see there?' The
boy described his family and said, 'Your
sister is sitting at a table writing a letter
to you.' 'Can you see wnat she is writ
ing ?' The boy read the letter so far as it
was written. Five days afterward the let
ter came to hand with the message as the
boy had read it. Such evidences of this
strange power is quite common to practi
tioners.
"We had a small boy in the clairvoyant
state here in the office the other eve nine.
He led us, according to suggestion, to
many places. Finally we landed himâ by
suggestion of courseâ on Market street, at
the corner of Third. I told him to look
up at the clock in the Chronicle building
and tell us what time it was. 'It is 28
minutes of 9,' he said. We looked from
our window and saw that he had seen cor
rectly. No, as I Have said, I cannot un
dertake to explain it? 1 know nothing of
the cause of the phenomenon â I do not
know. I only know the results that we
gained, not how they were gained. Em
ployed for good, hypnotism is a great
boon in many ways, especially in surgery
and dentistry. The persons coming out
of a hpnotic sleep find themselves re
freshed more than from the natural
sleep. During that sleep they may nave
had their teeth plugged or their legs
sawed off." _

DOCKERY USED HIS GUN
A Refractory Milk- Wagon Driver
Is Halted by a
Bullet.
Twenty-Tbree Cans of Impure Milk
Dumped in the Gutter by the
Inspector.
For the second time since he received
his appointment Milk Inspector Dockery
had to use his pistol on a refractory milk
man yesterday morning and send a sing
ing bullet after a wagon that would not
halt. During the small hours of the
morning Dockery took his stand at Eiebt
eenth and Mission streets and held up a
number of wagons that were on their way
to the City to deliver the early morning
milk.
He was assisted by Market Inspector
Ben Davis and Inspectors Hanlon and
Harrigan, and within a short time a
balf dozen drivers were standing about
with anxious faces while Dockery applied
the tests that would either condemn the
fluid to being dumped into the street or
prove it sufficiently pure to be served to
customers. While the process was going
on Julius Buhm, who drives for Mrs. T.
Bauer, came by with his load and was
hailed by the Milk Inspector and told to
cet into line.
Instead of complying he whipped up his
horses and started down the street at a
rattling pace. Again and again he was
called upon to halt, but he paid no atten
tion, and then Dockery made a gun play.
A bullet went uncomfortably close to
Buhm's head and his pace slackened, but
he had gone a block before overtaken by
the inspector and compelled so return.
When an inspection of the milk in his
wagon jvas made the reason for his haste
was apparent. Not one of tne twenty-three
cans contained milk that would stand the
test, and he was driven to the City Prison
and locked up on a charge of bringing into
the City impure milk.
Later his milk was dumped into the
street to help flush the sewers. The milk
in all the other wagons examined was
found to be pure enough to stand the test.
KEPT THE SHOES.
D. C. James Draw* a Bevolver on a
Storekeeper and Gets Arrested.
D. C. James, a picture-peddler, was ar
rested last evening by Officers T. L.
Ryan and E. O'Day and detained at the
Southern police station on a double charge
of robbery ana carrying a concealed
weapon.
James entered Mark (Cohen's shoe
store, corner of Third and Howard streets,
at 6 p. m. for the purpose of getting a pair
of shoes he had left the day before to be
repaired.
He was banded tbe shoes and was about
to leave the place when Cohen informed
him that he had neglected to pay for th*
repairing. James refused tofcpay, and
when Cohen and his assistant procceeded
to recover the shoes James Dulled a re
yolver, ana covering tbe storeKeeper,
backed out of the building and walked
away.
Officers Ryan and O'Day were notified,
and after a short search located James
and placed him under arrest.

Temporary Transfer Privileges.
Pending the renewal of operations on the
various lines of the Sacramento, Clay and
Powell street system, temporary transfer ar
rangements have been made with the Geary

All cars of the Market-street Railway Com
pany runing along Market street will issue

Kearney-street cars and the Gillmore-street

To Terminate a Trust.
George W. Prescott has applied to the Su
perior Court for permission to terminate two
trusts of $ 25.000 each, created by Charles H.
Simpkins for the benefit of Henry R. Simpkina,
his son, and Alice Simpkins, his daughter.
Prescott and Joslah W. Knowles were named
as trustees of the $50,000 and continued to
manage the fund up to the time of Knowles'
death, three months ago. The beneficiaries
are of legal age, and the remaining trustee
therefore prays for permission to give the
money into their hands to be invested as they
may see fit.

CAMPBELL IN COURT.

POINTS OF THE PEOBECTJTION.
Religion of the Talesmen Inquired
Into by the Atorneys tor
the Defense.
Contrary to expectations, the jury whlcn
will try Oliver A. Wintnrop on the charge
of robbing James O. Campbell, the Ha
waiian millionaire, was secured yesterday
and with little difficulty. The taking 01
testimony will begin this morning.
For some unexplained reason the crowd
of sensation-lovers that usually frequents
prominent criminal trials was absent from
Judge Wallace's courtroom. Another
thing whicn surprised the court officials
was the lack of feeling against the ac
cused evidenced by the talesmen. Al
though column after column has been
published concerning tbe remarkable ad
ventures of Mr. Campbell, few of the citi
zens called for jury duty acknowledged
having formed a fixed opinion as to the
guilt of Winthrop.
When court opened District Attorney
Barnes, aided by Assistant A. P. Biack,
appeared for the prosecution. Captain
LÂ«es and several of his Hawkshaws were
interested spectators, as also was the
prosecuting witness. For the defense At
torney Frank Bell appeared. Mrs. Win
throp, neatly attired in a well-fitting suit
of black, with a pretty bonnet and new
red gloves, nestled consolingly close to her
husband's side. The prisoner himself
seemed cheerful and at ease. He nodded
smilingly to several acquaintances, and

throughout the labor of securing the jury
paid close attention to the proceeding s.
The defense was very careful in the se
lection of jurymen and went into the mat
ter of the relipious views of the talesmen
before it would pas* any one. District At
torney Barnes objected to this, but Bell
sprang a Supreme Court decision on him,
and Judge Wallace overruled the objec
tion. Winthrop's connection with the
American Protective Association is the
cause of the anxiety of the defense on re
ligious matters.
District Attorney Barnes opened pro
ceedings by presenting a statement of the
alleged robbery of Campbell and the at
tempt to extort from him an order on his
wife for a large sum of money. After that
the work of securing the jury lasted until

WILLIAMS CASE
IS NOW CLOSED,
Collector Wise Was on the
Witness-Stand To-
Day.
HOW CHINESE CAME IN
The Assistant District Attorney
on Wong Sam's Char
acter.
ARGUMENT OF COUNSEL BEGUN
Defendant Accused of Having Depos
ited $4500 in Bank Within
Three Months.
The testimony in the Williams case was
concluded yeÃterday and the argument of
counsel was begun.
The day's proceedings opened with In
spector Ben Harrison on the stand. The
witness swore that the only exception to
tbe rule requiring written reports ou all
Chinese cases investigated were in those
instances when Williams had charge.
Harrison further said that defendant's
reputation for truth, honesty and veracity
was bad. It was also developed that the
landing certificate of Chin Shee Hung had
been made out by Tobin, and that "Wil
liams had examined the: Chinese on board
the steamer.
The prosecution then called United
States Commissioner Heacock, Rev. Fred
erick Masters, pastor of the Chinese Mis
sion, Rev. Ira Condit, a Chinese mission
ary, and Deputy Collector Tobin, all testi
fying that the general reputation of
Williams was bad. On cross-examination
Mr. Condit said the character of Wong
Sam was also bad.
Collector Wise was then recalled for the
defense. He said that in 1893 one hun
dred and twenty-seven females arrived, in
which there were only eight written
reports. He said also that Wil
liams, during tLe period namfd, had
no connection witii the "women cases."
Continuing be said tbat the records
show that in 1894 110 female Chinese
arrived and five reported in writing. In
1895 seventy-one women arrived, on which
fcixteen reports were written by tbe in
spectors and twenty-four by various other
officials.
"When did you examine the records?"
questioned Mr. Henley.
â¢LAst night," was the reply, "because
in my office Major Moore â "
"Never mind what Major Moore said,"
interrupted Mr. Henley.
"Weil," continued tbe Collector, "the
statement was made that Williams had
charge of tho&e cases and 1 . waut to
show â "
At this point Judge Morrow interrupted
the Collector and asked him to answer
only the questions put to him.
At the conclusion of Mr. Wise's testimony
the defense and prosecution announced
that no further evidence was at hand and
the case lor and against was announced as
closed.
Assistant United States District At^rney
Scnlessinger addressed the jury. Hvpaid
particular attention to the attempt of the
defense to 6how the bad character of
Wong Sam. Among other things he said:
This case is in a meaure dependent upon
Chinese testimony. The crimes charged upon
the defendant conbist of transactions with the
memb.Ts of that race. The defendant's busi
ness associates were Chinese. They had to be
brought here ah wituesses, and are entitled to
the same credit hs other witnesses; but an
effort has been made to impeach the repu
tmion of one of the principal witnesses for the
Government, Wong Sam. The Government
assert? that he has not been impeached; that
bis testimony is corroborated by the uncontra
dicted circumstances oi the case, and his evi
dence should therefore be considered; how
ever, if Wong bam stands beiore this jury in
an unfavorable light, our answer # is, that he
was the business associate of this defendant.
He does not deny his share in the transactions.
The Government does not contend that Wong
bam stands in this community lor high moral
integrity, but he is exactly the person you
could expect to tind as the partner in crime oi
this defendant. Williams selected him, and it
is with bad grace that he now attempts to
blacken his reputation.
Williams contends that he had money be
fore his appointment as a Chinese Inspector.
Do you believe it? If he had had money
money would he in his conversation with Van
Pelt have made the remark, "This business
Will be a. godsend?"
Mr. Schiessinger then reviewed at length
the testimony offered by tba defense, as
compared with that of tiie prosecution.
In conclusion he said:
I reiterate, gentlemen, that the Chinese tes
timony for tue Government im this case is
corroborated by circumstances unexplainable,
the delay in the landings, the absence of the
reports and another circumstance, perhaps the
most conclusive of all, to which 1 will now ad
vert. During the period of time set out in this
indictment, a period of three months, the de
fendant's deposits in banks of this City
amounted to nearly $4500. The mathema
tician does not live who can account for the
possession of so much money on the basis of
the salary received by the defendant; and if
he was the honest, active and fearless officer it
is claimed, he cou.d not have made it in ont-
Fi<le business. Can you reconcile your con
sciences with the facts concerning this
money? Are you not convitced that during
the peiiod set out in this indictment Williams
â¢wAs extorting and extorting extensively?
The Government, with modesty, has put his
extortions at an amount far below the true
Bum, as shown by these deposits.
Attorney Coogan, for the defense, then
began his argument. He contended that
no case had been made out against Wil
liams, and that he was a persecuted in
stead of a prosecuted man.
Mowry followed in a similar strain, and
when 4 o'clock came he was still speaking.
He will conclude this morning, and then
Mr. Henley will close for the prosecution.
It is expected that a verdict will be
reached some time to-uay.

SAVED FROM SLAVERY.
Chief Crowley Protects Katshu Tano,
a Japanese Girl, From Her
Persecutors.
Katshu Yano, a Japanese girl, was
brought from Fresno yesterday morning
by Detective Siivey on a warrant charging
her with petty larceny. The case was
called in Judge Joachimsen's court in the
afternoon and was dismissed.
The complaining witness was M. Ishii,
118 Prospect place, and he alleged that the
girl, with whom he had been living for
four years, had stolen a $20 gold piece
from him and some letters.
Chief Crowley investigated the case and
decided to protect the Kirl. Her story was
that Ishii had been living off her earn
ings, when she learned about six weeks
ago that be was negotiating with some
Chinese to sell her for $700. Sue fled to
Fresno, leaving all her clothing except
what she wore. In Fresno she made a liv
ing by teaching pupils to play on the sam
sin and other Japanese instruments, and
wanted to be a good girl.
The Chief was satisfied that Ishii had
trumped up the charge against the girl to
regain possession of her, and she will be
detained in the matron's quarters in the
City Prison till she can, find a home.
FERNANDEZ IS GRATEFUL.
The Deckhand Addresses the
Officers of the Children's
Society.
Suitable Testimonial of Regard to the
Memory of General John
McComb.
"I am proud of my medal and most
grateful for having the right to wear it.
Though I know nothing of speechmaking,
I am sure you gentlemen will understand
me. During life I shall wear my medal
whenever I want to look my best, and
after my death I hope it will be buried
with my body."
Thus did Gus Fernandez address the
directors of the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children at their meeting
yesterday afternoon. Though his lan
guage sounded strange to English ears,
his meaning was plain, and the directors
responded to his expression of gratitude
by pressing his hand.
"I am sure," remarked President Sonn
tag, "that the first presentation of the so
ciety's medal has been made to a brave
man who well deserved it. His courage
ous forgetfulness of self in the prompt
rescue of Mrs. Mitchell and her son when
they were in imminent peril of drowning
clearly merited some special recognition
from this society. I hope this event in
his life may inspire him to the repetition
of similar deeds of bravery and" mercy
and serve as an example to others."
Fernandez, his face aglow with satisfac
tion, albeit somewhat confused at the
praises showered upon him, took his de
parture amid a burst of applause, and the
business of the meeting was resumed.
It was decided that a medal be awarded
to James Fulton Shepard of Alameda, the
young man who saved a boy of 12 years
named Willie Durant from drowning.
The circumstances of tbe rescue were
fully detailed in The Call of the follow
ing morning.
The special committee appointed to
draft resolutions of respect to the memory
of the late General McComb, former secre
tary of the society, presented the follow
ing, which was unanimously adopted:
Whereas. The late General John McComb
brought to the discharge of his duties a
tary of this society all the advantages acquired
by long and varied experience; and whereas,
his familiarity with the care of public wards,
his long connection with the public press and
with courts of law ail contributed in making
up his special fitness for the position. As an
evidence of appreciation by this board it is
Resolved, That in the death of its late secre
tary, John McComb, tne Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Children sustains a direct
and a great loss, and that it is no reflection
upon the capacity of his successor that this
board regarded the loss as almost irreparable.
Resolved, That this memorial and these reso
lutions be spread upon the minutes of the
board and a copy thereof be furnished to the
lamily of the deceased, and that a copy be
offered to the press of this City.

WATCHMEN NOT WATCHED
No Track of Their Engagements
Kept in the Sheriffs
Oifice.
Peculiar State of Affnrs Disclosed by
an Order in the Howard
Black Case.
A peculiar state of affairs which prevails
in the Sheriff's office came to light in
Judge Slack's court yesterday. An order
to show cause why Sheriff Whelan should
not pay to the creditors of Howard Black
money realized from a sale of certain as
sets was before the court. The Sheriff
claimed that he was entitled to $12 for four
days' keeper's fees under attachment, $45
for fifteen days' watchman's fe?s in in
solvency, ?20 attorney's fees, and re
ceiver's fees at a certain percentaee on the
amount collected.
Under the new fee bill the Sheriff is en
titled to but $2 a day for watchmen's and
keepers' fees, which he acknowledges.
The attorney for the creditors, Leon
Bamuels, objected, however, to payment
of the watchman's fees at all, alleging that
the place was locked up all the time and
no watchman was needed or on hand.
Deputy Simon oi tbe Sheriff's office
claimed the watchman was there, but
when asked who he was and on what
dates could not tell, and it was developed
that no timebook is kept on tbe doings of
the various watchmen and keepers em
ployed in attachment and insolvency
cases. Judge Slack was surprised, anil
advised Simon to keep such a boox.
The aigument as to why attorney's fees
should be paid was very weak, and in all
probability that item will be disallowed
when the case comes up this morning.
Threat* to Kill.
E. Vcntuona, saloon-keeper, 500 Francisco
street, swore to a complaint in Judge Joachim
sen's court yesterday charging John Hall
with threats to kill. He said that Hall and
some others raised a disturbance in his saloon
on Friday evening and he swore out com
plaints tor their arrest for malicious mischief.
Monday night Hall went to the saloon and
pulling a revolver out of his pocket threatened
to kill Ventuona if he pushed the case r gainst
him for malicious mischief.
Fire in a Dwelling.
An alarm was sounded from box 126 yester

Legislative ticket, were pretty largely at
tended and with the additional and usual
resource of voting ballots in bunches
several thousand votes were rolled up.
What rows occurred were little ones
and due mainly to steam beer. As with
but few exceptions the tickets had been
properly decided on with the aid of
i Ãuckley's advice beforehand, there were
contests in but few districts. The princi
pal one was in the Seventeenth Senatorial
District, where Police Court Clerk Law
rence Buckley of the Twenty-eighth As
sembly District and Thomas F. Egan of
the Street Department and the Twenty
ninth District were hot rivals for the
Senatorial nomination.
Egan had his district solid for him, and
"Larry" Buckley was just as solid across
Third street Both sides voted every bal
lot that could be rustled up, if not more,
and though the vote was really large,
especially in the Twenty-eighth, the con
test depended mainly on the supply of
ballots. Up in the Twenty-ninth, at
Irish-American Hall, the inspector would
open and inspect any large bunches of
ballots offered by a voter he was not quite
sure of, and down at First and Howard
streets Mr. Buckley's interests were
looked after just as faithfully. Each side
sent watchers and challengers to the
other's district, and in each district the
enemy was thrown out and chased away
from the polls.
The Egan election officers in the Twen
ty-ninth counted 975 ballots, threw out 8
and credited Egan with 952. In the Twen
ty-eighth 961 ballots were taken from the
box, and at midnight no votes for Egan
bad been found. It was thought last night
that Buckley would have the most votes,
and that Egan would contest the election.
There were no other contests for Senator
ial nominations, and there were contests
for tuo Assembly nomination in but three
districts. The Senatorial ticket is as fol
lows:
Seventeenth Districtâ La wrenco Buckley.
Nineteenth â W. J. Bell.
Twenty-first â James D. Powers.
Twenty-thirdâ 1). J. McCarthy.
Twenty-fifthâ George F. Callaghan.
The nominations for the Assembly are
as follows:
Twenty-eighth Districtâ Lawrence J. Conlon.
Twenty-ninthâ James J. Meagher.
Tiiirty-firstâ T. E Treaccy.
Thirty-secondâ John A. Townley.
Thirty-thirdâ E. J. Crane.
Thirty-fourthâ John McConvil'.e.
Thirty-fifthâ R J. Carr.
Thirty-sixthâ Henry AlcGrath.
Thirty-seventhâ Harry J. Mulcrevy.
Thirty-eight nâ Percy lioldstone.
Thirty-ninthâ Lee liarnert.

Forty-fiistâ Henry M. Owens.
Forty-secondâ E. J. Reynolds.
Forty-thirdâ A. H. Armstrong.
Forty- fourth â Gabriel Nathan,
Forty-fifthâ Felix Mulgrew.
The following are the statesmen who
will assemble in B'nai B'ritn Hall to-mor
row night to begin the work of nominat
ing a ticket for Chris Buckley, there being
a representation of twenty-rive fr.m each
district, making a convention of 450:

STANTON FOR MAYOR.
Buckley Will Run Him on a
Dollar - Limit Plat
form.
Dr. James I. Stan ton, the Railroad Com
missioner, is looked upon by the Buck
leyitesas their angel, because they think
he is the only man in their faction who,
as head of their ticket, would make even
a bluff at carrying Chris Buckley through
the local campaign.
The Buckleyites insist on him taking
the nomination for Mayor, and yesterday,
after some weeks of hesitation, he spoke
favorably to his friends of accepting the
nomination, and promised to give a posi
tive answer to day.
The buckleyites propose, if they get a
chance to run a ticket at all, to play the
dollar limit and lower gas and water rates
as the chief features of their platform. All
the nominees for Supervisors will be
pledged to the dollar limit. This pledge
applies only to public municipal taxation,
â ni r V.Â° the slate is already made up.
Fleet F. Strother is to be the candidate for
Auditor, Thomas J. Glynn will be renomi
nated for Recorder and M. C. Haley will
be named for County Clerk. '

SOUND-MONEY DEMOCRATS
Chairman Pond Appoints the
Working Campaign Com
mlttess.
The executive committee of the Sound-
Money Democratic League cleared its
decks for campaign work at a meeting in
the assembly room of the Mills building
yesterday. There was a large attendance
of the members of the committee, who
number twenty-live. Chairman E. BPond
presided and announced the following
working committees:
Financeâ Henry Fortmann, Christian Rei*.
John Rosenfeld, A. A. Waulns, E. B. Pond. J.
b. Tooin, Murcus Rosenthal, George M. Pack
ard. T. li. Berry.
Literatureâ William Thome*, J. E. Runde,
W. P. Johnson.
Pistrtt.ution-Peter F. Dunne. Emll Pohli, J.
P. Irish.
Publication-C. P. Eels, Jeremiah Lynch, N.
McLaren.
Heudijuartersâ T.S.Williams Jr.. Robert Y.
Hayne, Colin M. Smith.
Secretary Elliott McAllister ieported
constant accessions to the membership of
the league. The discussions showed that
the leaders of the sound-money cause in
the State are thoroughly in earnest and
disposed to take hold of the campaign for
principle with vigor and â¢ resolution. It
was the consensus of opinion that dis
tributing agencies for the dissemination
of campaign literature should be secured
in the form of clubs or single volunteers.
An immense amount of literature will be
distributed through the mails and in the
ordinary ways. Permanent headquarters
will De secured at once and systematic
work will quickly follow the Indianhpol'.s
convention. It was remarked that the
purpose of the movement was not to elect
anybody, but to defeat Bryan and the
anarchistic purposes of those who have
gained control of the party.
"We don't care whether our friends vote
for McKinley or go fishing," said Attorney
William Thomas.
The committee will be called together
again within a week.

SENATORIAL CONVENTION.
Democratic Delegates From Marin
and Contra Costa Counties
Met Monday.
The joint Senatorial convention of Contra
Costa and Marin counties was held in
Assembly Hall of the California Hotel at
2 o'clock p. m. Monday. M. F. Cochrane
of Marin was chosen chairman and S. Far
jeon of Contra Costa was chosen secretary.
C. F. Montgomery of Contra Costa was
the unanimous choice for joint Senator,
and was nominated for joint Senator. Mr.
Montgomery is well known throughout
the State as a popular and representative
citizen. The delegates present were: From
Contra Costaâ S. L. Sullivan, C. A.
Sweeney, F. Williams, J. M. Simpson, S.
Farjeon, J. McCJoskey, J. T. Wheelahan.
From Marinâ J. H. Wilkins, J. W. Coch
rane, J. T. Burke, M. F. Cochrane, J. E.

GRAND JURY IN SESSION
An Adjournment Was Taken
Until the 18th of Sep
tember.
Waiting to See the Accusation
Against the Solid Seven
Tested.
The Grand Jury held a session yester
day afternoon but did not consider new
business. It was expected yesterday that
definite announcement would be made of
the time for final adjournment, but a de
cision was reached to adjourn until
September 18.
It seems tbat Judge Slack is not anxious
to impanel another Grand Jury at the
present time, and so has not manifested a
desire for the present jury to adjourn
sine die. Again, the case pending in
Judge Seawell's court against the seven
accused Supervisors is regarded as highly
important. It has been deemed wise by
members of the jury to prolong the ses
sions until some questions of law relating
to the accusation are settled. It is possi
ble that further action may be taken by
the Grand Jury.
Petei McGlade, Chief Deputy in the
Registrar's ofiice, and William Harring
ton of the registration department were
called as witnesses yesterday, but the sub
ject on which they were called went over
until the next meeting. The Grand Jury
is not advised of any fraudulent registra
tion beyond the listing of a few stuffers
whose names have been canceled.
O f i Third street, two blocks south of
Market, Mr. Harrington reported twenty
six stuffers. When citations were sent
out only eieht responded. He farcies
that tramps begging in that locality and
getting enough money for a night's lodg
ing availed themselves of the opportunity
of precinct registration in that neighbor
hood. Perhaps the next day they regis
tered in some lodging-house precinct north
of Market street.
The books of the Edison Light and
Power Company were opened to the ex
pert of the Grand Jury. So far as can be
ascertained no entries were iound indi
cating cash disbursements to procure fa
vors from the seven Supervisors. The
cash transactions of the corporation rep
resent a vast volume of business.
WANTED HIM IN PRISON,
Strange Testimony Given in a
Justice's Court Liti
gation.
S R. Mount Makes a Startling Charge
Against Dr. Edward M.
Patterson.
The suit of S. R. Mount, a saloon
keeper of this City, against Dr. E. M.
Patterson of Oakland, which was tried be
fore Justice of the Peace Carroll yester
day, brought out some startling testimony
regarding the means by which a young
man now confined at San Quentin was
sent there.
When Dr. Almon Lull died at Berkeley
in 1894 he left an estate of $75,000, of which
$7000 was left in trust to a son, James
Lull, who was to receive the interest. The
executors were Mrs. Lull, thÂ«* physician's
wife, and Dr. Patterson, and tbe bulk of
the estate was left to two daughters, Mrs.
Maria A. PJatt and Mrs. Susan N. Nye.
Later Mrs. Lull died, cutting her son off
with a dollar.
>*ot being nble to get the money left
him by his father young Liull, who ap
pears to have been wild, forged the name
of Dr. Patterson to a checfc on the Central
Bank of Oakland for $45 and induced
Mount to cash it. Tbe forgery was dis
covered ana Lull was arrested. At tbe
trial of the suit yesterday Mount testified
that after Lull's arrest Dr. Patterson came
to him and said that the young man was
worthless and that his bisters wanted him
safely locked up in San QnenVn, and tbat
he, Dr. Patterson, was also anxious for
tbat.
According to Mount, Dr. Patterson
agreed to return him the $45 obtained by
Lull if he would use every endeavoi to see
the yountflnan landed in prison.
After Lull was safely in prison on a
three years' sentence Mount says that Dr.
Patterson refused to make good bis prom
ise of payment and the suit was the result.
The defense put in no testimony, relying
on technical grounds to knock out the
complaint, and the Justice took the mat
ter under advisement.
A STOCK TRANSACTION.
Stephen Ot!Â«, the Broker, Charged
With Felony Embezzlement.
Stephen OtiÂ«, the stockbroker, surren
dered himself at the City Prison yester
day afternoon as there was a warrant out
for his arrest on the charg* of felony em
bezzlement. He gave $1000 cash bail and
was released.
The complaining witness is Mra. Annie
McManus, a widow living at 1128}^ Har
rison street. She swore to the complaint
in Judge Campbell's court last Friday and
alleged that the defendant embezzled
$2400 worth of her stock.
Mr. O.is says that Mrs. McManus did
not put up the necessary margin on tbe
stock and he was forced to sell it. It was
purely a business transaction as would be
shown when the case came on for hearing. (
TO WORK FOR PROGRESS
The Panhandle and Ashbury
Heights Clubs Organized
Last Evening.
Over 500 Persons Present at the First
Meetingâ Bnsiness of the
Future.
The Panhandle and Ashbury Heights
Improvement Club was formally organ
ized e.t 1970 Page street last evening, with
Dr. C. D. Salfield as president. It is com
posed of the old Stanyan street and Ash
bury Heights Improvement clubs, which
have accomplished so much good for their
districts in the past, and the new organi
zation of about 300 members begins its ex
istence and its work under the most favor
able auspices.
The complete roll of officers is as fol
lows: President, C. D. Salfield; vice-presi
dent, D. J. o'L.eary ; secretary, E. L. Head ;
treasurer, R. D. Cranston. The executive
committee are: Judge J. R. Aitken, A. J.
McFarland and Â£. R. Knight.
The fact that 500 persons, residents of
the vicinity, were present demonstrates
the interest taken in the new club. Its
jurisdiction extends over the territory
lying between Baker street and First
avenue and from Fulton street south of
the panhandle to Eighteenth.
Among the business taken up at the
first meeting of the ciub was the follow
ing resolutions, strongly disproving of the
proposed removal of the Pesthouse to the
Almshouse tract:
Whkreas, On several occasions an attempt
has been made to remove the Pesthouse iroin
its present unfit location to tne Almshouse
Tract; and whereas, it has come to our notice
that a strong combination is at present active
ly at work to induce the Board of Supervisors
to remove said Pesthouse to the Almshouse
Tract; and whereas, the Almshouse Tract
being almost the geographical center of this
City and County; and whereas, Lake
Honda, from which half of this City re
ceives its water supply, is located in the closest
possible proximity to said Almshouse Tract;
and whereas, the thickly populated districts
known as Ashbury Heights, Snnset Heights,
Btanyan street Heights and the Panhandle
districts are immediately east of said Aims
house Tract and in the track of the trade
winds from said site; and whereas, Golden Gate
Park and*the avenue, the pleasure grounds of
the pgople, are also in close proximity ; and
whereas, iaid Almshouse Tract can only be
reached by the frequented avenues which lead
to said Golden Gate Park; therefore,
Resolved, That we, the members of the Pan
handle and Ashbury Heights Improvement
Club, in meeting assembled, strenuously pro
test against the removal of the Pesihouse to
said Almshouse Tract, and that we look upon
this threatened or contemplated removal as
not only extremely unwise, but criminally
vicious, and that we will discountenance and
resist the same by all means in our sower, and
further
Resolved, That the president of this club ap
point a committee of twenty members to wait
upon the" Health and Police Committee ot the
Honorable the Board of Supervisors and upon
every Individual member of said board, and
also upon the Honorable the Board of Health
to enter verbal protest against such move ; and
further
Resolved, That a copy of this preamble and of
these resolutions be addressed to the Honor
able the Board of Health and to the Honorable
the Board of Supervisors of this City and

MANHOOD
SLIPPING
AWAY.
Look at that man, if he may be called |
such.
He is nervous, fretful, irritable. He is
bilious, melancholy, liver torpid, circula-
tion sluggish, digestion bad and appetite
poor. He feels run down, is easily made
tired, and has frequent headaches.
That is what he talks about.
And he has troubles of a different na-
ture. He has loss of pleasure in the per-
formance of certain natural functions;
loss of vitality and manly vigor; loss of
desire, feeble power, premature discharge
and so forth.
That is what he does not talk
about, not even to his family physician.
He goes to him with the first set of symp-
toms and gets temporary relief. But the
latter set, from which the former often

arise, he keeps to himself. He suffers in
secret silence, brooding over bis unmanly
condition. In the meantime he can't con-
trol his actions. His feeble power gives
wÂ»y to unnatural lust. His wanton crav-
ings increase as his ability to gratify de-

.865 MARKET STREET, Opposite Baldwin Hotel,
jRI SAN FRANCISCO. CAL.
County, and to his Honor the Mayor'and to
every individual member of said boards.
A resolution was adopted appointing a
committee of five to petition the Board of
Supervisors and Paric Commissioners re
garding the lighting of Golden Gate Park
and the adjoining streets and Tlrives with
electric lamps of 2COO candJepower, en
poles not over 400 feet apart.
It was also resolved that the owners of
the Beard estate be compelled to improve
that property. It consists 01 eleven blocks
of land between Central avenue and Qola
street, and between Waller and Page.
Part of the tract is almost a howling
wilderness, and none of the improvement
clubs of the locality have been so far able
to overcome the protests of the owners
thereof against reclaiming the tract from
its state of mature.
A resolution was also adopted calling
Postmaster McCoppin's attention to the
fact that the district was sadly in need of
a branch postoffice, or at least a better de
livery and collection of the mails, espe
cially tbe night collection.
On motion of Mr. Clement it was or
dered that the matter of having the streets
of the district marked for identification
with names on the street lamps or on cor
nersof buildings be attended to.

night. While off Cape St. John in the Atlantic
Phe experienced a fourteen days tale and
heavy cross sea, rolling her sails under water

Man ahoy ! The rapids are below you!
The whirlpool vortex is in sight! Your
manhood is slipping away from you! You
are drifting to wreck and ruin !
But there is yet help for you, and a per-
fect cure, too, if you will promptly secure
the services of the learned specialist, Doc-
tor Cook, who can tell you more about
your exact condition at one consultation
than an ordinary physician can after
many weeks of fruitless treatment. He
will make out of you a man, with a man's
pride, a man's power, a man's privileges.
Doctor Cook not only restores Lost
Manhood and removes every symptom of
it from young, middle-aged and old men,
but he cures Gonorrhcca, Gleet, Stricture,
Syphilis, Varicoccle, Hydrocele and all
other signs of sexual debility, deformity
or decay. Careful attention he gives to
every form of female complaint, and to
nilments of the Hean, Lunes, Liver,
Stomach. Kidneys, Bladder and Urinary
Organs of both sexes. Piles, Fistula,. Rup-
iure and Chronic Catarrh come within his
specialty.
Doctor Cook particularly desires chronic,
obstinate, deep-seated diseases that have
baffled the skill of other physicians and
resisted their treatment. His thoughts
are continuously with stubborn cases and
their remedies.
Doctor Cook has developed a system of
home treatment by correspondence that
is absolutely perfect and always satisfac-
tory. Therefore, if you live out of the
city and cannot come to the doctor's office
write him. Describe your troubles freely
and without reserve, in your own way,
and be assured that your letter will be
carefully concealed from curious eyes.

lumbia Theater.
It was in every way a highly successful
event. The orchestral music, under the
leadership of Gnstav Hinrichs, was excel- !
lent, the addresses of President E. A.
Denicke of the Mechanics' Institute and
James D. Phelan were timely and -true- j
tive,and-the songs and recitations were
rao3t enjoyable.
After an overture by the orchestra, from j
the "Queen of Sheta," President E. A.
Denicke delivered his introductory ad- â 
dress. He said:
Ladie* end Gentltiai: I bid yon a sacst
hearty welcome to thetwenty-aiEth fair otthe ;

is dedicated to home products entirely. In
doing so it is but fictisg that I choaid explain
to you why we have this year departed from '
the time-honored custom ot holding a general i
exhibition, aad why this year fair is held '
undir the combined auspices of the 3lanuiac-
tarers' and Producers' Association "and the
Mechanic*' Institute. While fat many preced- '
ing years home industries have been a very:
conspicuous feature of cur fairs, aad .ass
year's exposition consisted almost entirely ci i
articles of home production, this year every
thing imported is strictly excluded- The ob- ;
ject of this is thoroughly to advertise home
product! and educate our citizens in the many
and various industries of thÂ« state. Ii goes
without laying that we did not do this in any
spirit cf enmity toward Eastern or foreign
manufacturers, but because of the urgent need
of an enlarged horn* market for our prod ecu.
You will all agree with me that the hard
times we are experieaciaz at present can oaly I
be relieved by aad through ourselves. It v
no use for as. to kneel in the mud and cry to

Instead â -: enriehiag our m people all
moneys so made will disapoes#into the pock-.
c -, of manufacturers elsewhere and into the
treasuries of transportation companies.
It is a well-known fact that any country
whlcn does not possess manufactories must
u'imately become poor. That we do possess j
manufactures of which we have every reason
to be proud is proved beyond doubt by this
exposition. The vital question is. therefore,
why not patronize them J thereby keeping for j
home circulation money nowj shipped- fcass,
the exodus of which Is throwing thousands
of our ciHsen* out of employment, thereby
r-eat'y impoverishing the State. Although
we are in the middle cf harvest large numbers
of unemployed JM2 throng the thoroughfares
of the City, and it is -.'.mated that there are
la San Francisco over five thousand vacant
tenements, stores and shops. A situation like
thUcertalni-r demands that every inhabitant
should exert himself to the utmost to find the
proper means of relief. Among them, one of
the most direct tad efficacious is to stop the
influx of manufactured goods which are In
competition with home productions. In other
-iords, by patronizing the industries of tae
State insure employment for its citizens.
We are ail more or less the slaves of habit
and when we nave accustomed ourselves to
certain brands of imported goods we are apt j
to imagine that we cannot do without then, j
Now.we purpose to show you at this exposition
that you can at least do without many of them,
that you can find at this large and fine exhibit [
of home production articles ta Â«TÂ«-ry respect
worthy to Sake their pUce. - It is for these rea
sons that the Mechanics' Institute aad the
Manufacturers' asd - Producers" Association
have - ned hands. Now, it is for you to come

100.000 American tourists carry to Europe
? 125,000,000 ineood American gold coinâ that
sound money or which so much is heard at
present; to Â«ay nothing of the millions which
are sent abroad every year for clothing, fnmi
tare, jewelry and many other things which
': could be obtained as srood or better En this
country. Again, out of every 100 Americans '
who visit Europe it would be safe to say that
not re of them have -raited the natural
wonders of their own country.

: patronize the Yellowstone Park, the Alaskan
! Glaciers or the Yosemite Valley as liberally m
â¢ they do th* Alpine heights of Switzerland, the
| roads aad accommodations would soon be im- !
t proved to meet the increased demands. As to !
the art standard, if only half the money which
' now goes Into the haad3 of European picture
dealers was expended with local artists, it
would soon be raised as high as that of any
nation on earth. Let thU be done and the
supply would soon meet the demand- State
art schools should be 'oan4ed as we now have
: State universities. WÂ« thould have State and
city art galleries receiving regular appropria
tions, and our artists would hold up their
; heads proudly.
Sow, the majority who patronize art scad
all their money to Europe for pictures; hence
the comparatively low standard of American
j art. Ifourricn men spent their leisure time
j at home the theatrical profession would be
r preatiy teueSted, and to insure the highest
dram atii art every ore of the larger cities ia
the Union should subsidize one or more thea

No exposition under the auspices of the in
stitute would be properly introduced to your
notice without a word or two about oar library
! on Post street, for the rapport and develop
ment of which ties* Mechanics' Fain are
partly giTea. This, then, is a proper occasion
to call yemr attention to the fact that the li
brary now contains 75,000 volumes of care
roily selected works, and that for works of
mechanical reference it ranks among the best
la the world. The three upper floors of the
building on Post street contain spacious and
comfortably furnished reading and chess
room*; the lower floor is fitted up a class
room, where mechanical and free-hand draw
leg, electricity and mathematics are taught.
In fact, it ia one of the moot complete and
I Sour.- institutes of the kind in tnese

: grand library and its convenient adjuncts is
only 50 cents per month, and I hope that the

In the slough of self-depreciation and shoula :
arouse ourselves to the dignity of our citizea- |
ship, and core particularly to the duties oi j
tae hour. Nature ha.^ endowed ocr City â It is j
lor the people to administer the trust. j
The past has been a black pare when we
measure rest! by opportunities. Commerce
has been crippled and diverted; the City has
fallen prey to a transportation conspiracy;
American "goo<is have even &eea shipped to
Ecrope and resaipjwd to Saa Fraacisco ia or
der to save the prohibitory rates imposed for
direct shipcieat; narbor rates and pilot
charges hare despoiled the weary merchant

made New Orleans the real port of California 'â 
In fact oar peerless position a* an entrepot !
has been turned against ourselves to satisf/
private interests, and the people have not yet
effectually established the self-evident prin- !
ciple that quasi-put l:c corporations have their
charter from the State to serve it. not to op- j
press it; to develop its resources, not to
crash them; to nse its natural advantages and
not to lock them up. Independent rail ways
from San Francisco into the interior will re
, store oar City as a port ana give the country
the advantages of the sea; the passing of
the Central and Unioa Pacific system into the.
l control of the Government or of rival corpora
i tions and the traction of an isthmian
canal will stimulate intercourse with distant
points and insure competitive rates, and thos
the future may in some measure atone for the
sins of tbe past.
Who shall say that spirit Is wanting in the
; people of san Francisco to-day? Has there i
not been a metamorphosis? Bo not the Traffic
Association, the North American Navigation
Company, the Valley Road, tae Slerchants'
Shipping Association, tae .Mechanics' Insti
tute, the Manufacturers' and Producers' As
sociation, the Merchants* Association and the
Improvement clubs speas for something?
; Have they not awakened the citizens to a
realization ci the fact that here are their nre
sides?
Of course, before everything else, the chief
element in a city's prosperity rues; be the profi
table employment of hÂ°r inhabitants, xrhien
' means a raartet for their productions at home
or abroad. So a municipality has more to do
than to keep its nouse clean, bealtby and beau
tiful â it must keep its worishop busy. TraÂ«Â£e
and commerce consist ia excaans*. One mast
exchanse vrhat he makes or has for what he
doesn't make but wanu. Prices remaining
the same, one naturally wants the best, the
most durable, the most artistic, the moat pala- I
table, the most wholeicme, as the case may 1
hi. Tne demand of tae ccnsTiner is the :
standard oi the workman.
It is true oi the past tbat not only the ques- :
tion oi fasnion, but the question ci qaaliiy as
j welL, determined tie choice of goods and
j gave the preierenc** in 00 many cases to the â 
iortign product. Now, Trty do goods "ms.de â 
In France," or "made in Germany." force their
â  way into our reluctant markeu? That is a
question for a well organized Eiuniclpaiity to
solve. The fault is largely with ocr educa
tion.. Ar oae time in Europe there trere craft
gciida organized to maintain the several [
i craits, to â i them, to prevent fracda
j lea; -ircrkmans btp and to transmit Jtnovnedse
j and skill. These have passed away aad Ia
j tceir place a better system has sprung no,
namely, municipal trades and technical
tchcois, which may be found in Berlin, Paris.
Lille, Hanover, Mi.aa and other cities, where
taa young are trained not in languages and
music alone, which our higa schools aSect,
bat -.:. tae useful arts, and especially in tnose
craits for which the locality is particularly
favored. They alÂ«o qualify men far civil ser
vic3 employment.
This is the secret of the better quality ot cer
tain foreign products and tares â and
also of souaci municipal administration â the
: superior technical skill in these concerns of
the French and German people. Therefore, to
I succeed *c must remodel and add to our
scacoi-aystem. James Lick, J. C .â :r<iing,
Charles Lex and Dr. Cogswell of thU City have
had right ideas ia endowing the trades schools
j aad their plans should be taken up by the City
j itself for the preservation and development of
. its craiu and manufactures.
There must be a mcaicinal policy in these
â  respects. We elect School Directors by acci-
I dent and they follow ia the old groove, show-
I ing the greatest activity when there . i a va
â  canry to be filled or a place to be created. Yoa
cannot get men fit to reorganize the schools
oa practical liaes under the present system of
election. School Directors ifaouid be appointed
oa the ground of fitness a'one. They may be
pled?- . In platforms, tat the platform in
variably slips Iroai ucder their feet as they
: ascend to office. If, however, tne executive of
i the government were charged with a duty the
{ power ot appointment aad removal would
I give him the means of carryicg cat the peo
ple's will.
The holding of this great fair annually helps
to inspire confidence asd seli-help. by giving
us an introspective glance at our own re
sources and our own needs. It helps in other
directionsâ it draws from all sections viaiiors
, who may come to laugh bnt whs will remain
to it; who come for pleasure, and who will
I remain as a permaaem additioa to oar popu
! iatioa. There are European cities teat Gertve
immeasereveaues from tourists and travelers,
and it ha* been statea that the French expo
sition in I:S3 saved that country frosi baak
ruptcy which otherwise would have been pre
cipitated by the failure of the copiwr trust aad
the Panama canal. Every visitor adds to the
voltime and flow of the circulating medium,
and thus adds to the general prosperity, stim

nations." San Francisco coui-i thus be made

devote their efforts to its realization Ixomyear

Tha citizens of San Francises know better
than they can be told of the inadequacy of
their present government, of its corruption
and c : its disgrace. There must be first. local
autonomy; secondly, executive independence
and systematic organization under a wise civtl
service, and. thirÂ«l. there most be legislative
independence. The. legislative bcdy should
not both appropriate money and expend it,
nor should it usurp the exsentive functions.

WHY THE WORKER WANTS McKINLEY FOR PRESIDENT.
Citizens of all classes, as may be noticed by the subjoined interviews which took
place yesterday, concur that the real issue before the voters at the pending Presiden
tial election is the protection of American industries, and that protection cannot be had
in any way other than the election of William McKinley for President of the United
States. Industrious attempts to befog the minds of voters, which are being made by
Democratic stump speakers and struggles to evade responsibility for falling wages
and hard times generally, have not fooled "the common people" any of the time.
They are fully awake to their own interest.
BEATS THEORIES.
J. BATTEATTE is a coffee-packer employed by the Washington
Manufacturing Company on First street,
Hnear Market. Mr. Batteatte has been em-
H ployed by the same company many years
Hand is well known all along First street.
IHe has a handsome home at Elmhurst,
I which he has earned by industry, economy
Hand the exercise of native shrewdness.
HHg said at once, when the subject of his
H political intentions was broached: "I am
Hgoing to vote for Mckinley, for I can see
Hclearly that my interest lies in that way.
HThe interest of all others similarly situ-
Hated â that is, men who depend on regular
Hemployment and a fair rate of pay for
Hwork performed â is the same as 1 find
Hmine to be. The more we import from
HEurope or from any cheap-labor country,
Hthe worse off we shall be. Of what ad-
Hvantape can it be to any workingman if
Hhome products are cheapened by the in-
Htroduction of foreign products if he has
Hno work and consequently no money
Hwitti which to purchase anything?
Hrrices have fallen some on various
Hproducts in the past few years, but no one
Hcan say that the condition of the working
men has been improved. The contrary is the fact, and this is too well
known to need any discussion. While times have been getting worse for
the laborer and the wage-earner because the tariff tinkering has let in a
flood of foreign-made goods to take the place of our own products, we
have also, during the same Democratic administration, had an example of Democratic
financiering. The Government, in a time of peace, has so handled matters that it has
been driven to borrowiug $262,000,000, and still we are not happy nor prosperous.
The reason for voting for McJvinley for President is that he is the great protectionist,
and I have no douptthat if he is elected he will carry out that policy to the best of
his ability if he has the RepuDlican majority in Congress to back him. I do not
understand the financial question. I do not believe that silver is a cure for all hard
times. The best cure for idleness and scarcity of money is business and the ability of
people to buy what is manutactured."
DEMOCRATS MADE TIMES HARD.
THOMAS D. PHILLIPS is the foreman of the bookbindery of Payot, Upham &
Co., stationers, at the corner of Battery^^^^^^^^^^^^^H^^^^^^^^^^^^H
and Pine streets. Mr. Phillips has beenH
engaged in the bookbindery business four-H
teen years and has worked in Boston andH
Chicago. He has been with- Payot, Uo-H
bam & Co. daring a Jong term of years.M
The bookbinding trade cannot be thor-H
oughly acquired in less than seven years\M
Mr. Phillips says, and competition whichM
threatens to destroy the industry of localM
bookbinders is a serious matter. Mr.H
Phillips spoke positively and with anH
abundance of practical information whenH
he said: "I am a McKinley man on theH
protection issue. Protection has the ten-H
dency to keep up wages and AmericanÃ
free trade tends to bring American wagesÃ
down to the European level. ProtectionÃ
will do more than anything else can B
hold American wages up. Ido not believeÃ
either in free trade or in a low tariff which B
leaves out any part of the measure of pro-H
tection which labor needs to make it wellÃ
paid. Wages have fallen largely since theÃ
inauguration of President Cleveland, and I
the tendency is still downward. I have^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^H
no figures to demonstrate what effect the Democratic policy has had on labor!
but it is a matter of common knowledge that these are hard times and that all the
years since the Democratic party came into power have been bad years for men work
ing either at skilled or unskilled labor. There are not needed figures to prove that to
be so. Yes, free trade brings into competition with this business tne products of
Europe in bindings, stationery and so Â§n." It is a hardship when a man has spent
from five to seven years to learn this business that he should be compelled, through
the laws made by Congress, to compete with the cheaper labor of Europe. I have notl
considered the money question fully. I consider that the real issue is protection."BÃ
FREE TRADE IS A MENACE.
S. W. LATZ is an all-round mechanic, who has lived in San Francisco since 1854.
resides at 1911 Geary street. "1 shall
â certainly vote for William McKinley and
â the policy of protection to American
â labor." said Mr. Latz. "I have observed
â enoueh of the course of affairs to know
â that free trade is not a good thin? for the
â man who is compelled to labor for wages.
â How can it be? The 'foreign manufac
â turers hire their workmen at a price away
â  below the American scale, and if the goods
â made abroad are brought in competition
â witn the goods manufactured in the
Hl'nited States that amounts to bringing
â the foreign laborer face to face with the
â  American laborer as a competitor. Only
â a certain amount of wares and mamifac
â  tures will be needed in any event. 80, if
â a part of the supply comes from abroad
â  and that portion is produced at lower
â  than American wages, two things will
â  happen. The first is that the demand for
â  less goods of home make will drive the
â  American workman to idleness or else
â  force him into other lines of work which
lower wages, or when the ranks of the unemployed are overfull and supply an over
stock of labor. 1 prefer that the rate of American wages shall be kept up as high as
possible. The election of Bryan for President could not supply laborers with protec
tion, for the Democratic party i 9 pledged against the protective principle. If the out
sider wants to compete with tiie home manufacturer in the market of the United
States he ought to be made to pay for that privilege. Every one is complaining about
the low wages which have b%en paid since President Cleveland was placed in power by
the Democrats. The silver question seems to be urged by the capitalists who own
silver, and who expect to profit by getting a high price for their silver after it has Deen
coined into dollars. Ido not see how any one except the capitalists who own silver
mines wili make any money out of the free coinage of silver. lam not able to discuss
the money question fully, of course, but I am satisfied that the free coinage of silver
which the Democrats propose is only an experiment, and we have experimented
enough already. San Francisco is full of idle men who cannot find work as every one
knows who looks about. Protection is a good thing, I know, for men who work for
wages, and that is why I shall vote for McKinley, who represents protection."
EUROPEAN COMPETITION BAD.
WILLIAM H. CROSBY is a skilled copper-plate printer and engraver, who has|
been employed by about all the large pub-^^^^^^^^^H^H^^^^^H^^^^^H
lishing-houses in San Francisco. HisÃ
labor is of the sort which is coinpara-B
lively little affected by European com-H
petition, but Mr. Crosby expresses hisÃ
understanding of the effects of a protcc-l
tive tariff, and also the evil effects of freeÃ
trade, and his sympathy is with the Re-B
publican desire to keep up wages, withÃ
clearness and with force. "DemocraticÃ
tariff tinkering," said Mr. Crosby, "hasH
sent wages down, and free silver will causeÃ
them to fall stil 1 more. For myself I doB
not want any 50-cent dollars, nor do I be-B
lieve that any workman ' does. I haveÃ
been in Mexico, and I am acquainted withÃ
Mexican money and with the conditionsH
in Mexico, and I can say, without reserva-B
tion, that I do not want any Mexican ex-B
perience for myself, in an industrial way.B
Free trade, which is advocated by the!
Democrats, must affect nearly every ex-H
istine branch of industry when it is putH
into operation, and there must necessarilyÃ
be a fall in the wages paid to artisans allÃ
along the line. There are more unem-^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^l
ployed people in San Francisco now than there were one year ago, and this bad condi
tion labor is growing worse and worse, with nothing in the policy, aims or accom
plishment of the Democratic party to promise any betterment so lon* as that political
organization is retained in power. While Bryan's election will benefit only the silver
mine owners and silver miners, the election of McKinley would hold forth an assur
ance of higher wages and more labor. The printing business has been affected by
foreign competition. I would be ashamed of myself had I voted for Cleveland and
the free-trade doctrine of tbe Democrats. I never have been fooled into votin^ that
way. I have been working in this line of business about seven years. I have oppor
tunities, of course, like every one else, to know, in a general way, when there are many
men unemployed. Thist is the worst time, in that respect, that I have ever seen.''

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 2, 1896,
ARLES CREWE is a porter in the steel and iron department of Holbrook,
Merrill & Stetson. Mr. Crewe resides in
â  West Berkeley. He has a wife and five
â children and says that they are all natur
â ally for protection. "1 shall vote for Me
â  Kinley, certainly," Mr. Grewe said.
â  "There are enough reasons why I should
â vote for him and none why I should rote
â for Bryan. In tbe first place McKinley is
â known. He has a public record which is
â  before the public, and he is more promi
â nently identified with tbe great issue of
â protection to American industries than
â any other man at this time. Why this
â should be so it is easy to answer. He has
â  been a firm and consistent and able advo
â cate of protection. The bill which was

are liable to have their incomes affected by competition from abroad. It entitled him
anew to the confidence of the people which he already possessed in such great measure.
Four years more of Democratic rule would be the ruination of this country, if we can
judge the future by the immediate past. You will notice that the Democrats still
want free trade. At least they do not advooate a tariff for protection, and they are
pursuing another new issue, which is an experiment only."

Bush, "we find that nearly every one of
those who trade with us is in favor of

nation.
"The argument generally adduced is I
the protective issue. Wool merchants, I
find, have discovered by their experience
under the Wilson bill that only in protec
tion lies the best interests of those engaged
in that business. The general complaint
is, that under the Wilson bill the price
obtained for wool was much less than
under the MrKinley bill.i^^^^M^^^^BjM
"As it is with wool men, bo it is with
nearly all other men engaged in industries
of a like character.
"The tendency, I believe, is to subordi

When everybody had work there was no

no necessity for it.

parison of countries run on a gold standard with free silver countries, such as China,
Japan, India and Mexico. If laborers there receive only twenty or thirty cents a dayâ
perhapi that estimate is a rather high averageâ why, they must be warranted in believ
ing we are better off as it is. After all, it seems that protection is the living issue."

he says that as he believes so does the!

VAGARIES OF SILVERITES.
"The vagaries of the silverites are bringing American finance into disrepute," said
Walter Hirschfeld of Radam's Microbe
Killer Company, 1340 Market street, "and I
are doing worse â they are embarrassing I
their own Government. Their aim, which I
seems to be the debasement of money, has I
already impaired the general credit of the I
United States, and in the markets of I
Eu rope American securities have already I
suffered a general decline.
"For three years in succession the ex- I
penditure of the Government has ex- I
ceeded the income. This condition of I
affairs is a serious embarrassment to the I
Government and operates toward the re- I
striction of trade by virtue of the unfav- I
orable opinion it creates. Till the Presi- I
dential election is over and the political I
excitement abates there is no hope of im- I
proveinent in the industries and trade of I
the States.
"The public is always a very uncertain I
quamity, and it is this uncertainty which I
tends to restrict legitimate trsde opera- I
tions.
"If the majority of the merchants and I
bankers could look to the election of Me- I
Kmley and the Republican party they
could act accordingly and would be inclined to push business and branch into new
ventures. Of course tariff is an important question. Many industries of this country
need much more protection than they at present enjoy.
"1 believe that free coinage of silver would so depreciate the purchasing power of
our currency that it would be of no advantage to the working classes, even Supposing
that they earned a few dollars more weekly. What gopd could it do if all they wished
to purchase would cost double what it costs to-day? Wa^es would not increase to
any appreciable extent, but the price of all commodities would rise. For instance, if
New Orleans can sell cotton to Europe to-day for 8 centÃ gold the American manu
facturer would have to pay 16 cents silver for it and the result would be that the price
of clothing would be doubled. The same would apply to all the produce of the
country for which there is a market abroad."
NO TIME FOR EXPERIMENTS.
anch as proposed by free silver would mean the readjustment
if every financial condition in the coun-
Htry,'' said Herbert Â£. Law of the Viavi
Icompany. "A spasmodic radical change
Mwould mean destruction to 90 per cent of
Ithe businesses, for the reason that it would
Himmediately destroy confidence â that
Hiarge element on which the great majority
|of business is transacted. As a, compara-
Htively new country we have spread out to
Hphenomenal extent. We have been able
Hto do this because our credit is good, be-
HcauÂ«e wp have always kent our promises
Bgood. If it were possible to operate sue-
Bcessfuliy on free silver, granting that it
Hwas all that its friends claim for it, it
Mwould necessitate the withdrawal of all
Hmoney loaned on a gold basis. In a word,
flit would mean that every merchant could
Mcarry just as much stock as he was able to
Bpay for in hard cash at the time he placed
Shin order.
"The affairs of the world hinge upon
I confidence. That confidence must be
Hinaintair.ed. We must have a leader who
Hwill insure a conservative policy; a leader
will command the ieÂ«pect, confidence
and trust not only of our own country, but of Europe, from whom we borrow so
largely and with whose gold we have been able to extend our enterprises and indus
tries fully 100 years beyond what would have been possible had we been limited to
our own capital. Wmle it is entirely possible to live within ourselves â independent
of the world at large â It is not possible to do so with any degree of prosperity. We
need our credit, protection of our industries, development of our harbors, increase of
manufacture in our city, and that stimulus and impetus to trade which can and will
come only under the leadership of the Republican nominee."

CHARLES HELLWIG'S WIEVVS.
"I want to see McKinley elected," said Charles Hellwig. cashier of toe Palace
Hardware Company, on Market street,
"I want to see him in because he is the I
head of the party in whose principles 1 1
believe f ally. Why should I not believe I
in the Republican party? It is the party I
of accomplishment. It always has a I
definite policy, and that policy, when fol- 1
lowed, is better tor the general good than I
what is offered for oar practical consider- 1
ation by the Democrats. I will admit mat I
my natural tendency bas always been in I
the direction of Republicanism. There I
are more reasons for electing McKinley I
now than I care to enumerate. The prin-H
cipal one is that we need better times, I
settled conditions, active business, public I
confidence, protection for home indus-H
tries, an American policy of
for the benefit of Americans, and that I
McKinley promises all these in his person I
and in his past performances in public. I
I think that manufacturing will be stirau-B
lated by putting the Republican party in I
charge of the Government. I do not be- 1
lieve that the issue is between silver and I
gold, but Ido believe that protection orÃ
free trade is the vital question. There cannot be any question thai; it is wiser to
encourage home yidustry than to build up foreign industry at our own expense.
That is all that I care to say."FUSION ENDING

DEFIED THE COMMITTEE
McGlashan Gives Reasons Why
He Would Be Stronger
Than De Vries.
MONTEITH TAKES THE TEAP.
Vann and Castle Will Be Turned
Down in the Third and Sixth
for the Democrats.
The joint Democratic-Popnlist-Silverite
fusion conference committee went into
Bession at 2 o'clock Monday afternoon
and did not adjourn until 6:25 p. m.
The serious obstacle which they met
was tne refusal of Messrs. Monteith and
McGlashan, Populist nominees for Con
gress, and of Kelly and Maddux, Demo
cratic nominees, to withdraw so as to
leave the field clear for fusion.
McGlashan, Maddux and Kelly did not
appear before tbe committee. Theywera
evidently in a state of defiance, and they,
like Monteitn, had no doubt receiyed a
hunch that if they should withdraw their
â withdrawals would be received by the
committee with indecent alacrity, to be
followed by the assumed regret ot the
committee when making the announce
ment tnat somebody else had been put
into their places for the best good of the
Democratic party.
C. D. Lane, millionaire and mine
owner, presided at the conference. There
were present: Eugene N. Deuprey, H. P.
Andrews, "NVoodson Ganard, M. C. Has
eett and Joseph Leggett, Democrats; J.W.
Keegan, L. M. Landsborough, J. M. Moore,
A. B. Kinne, E. M. Wurdail and Jonn S.
Dore, Populists, and Charle3 D. Lane, W.
P. Lawior and James R. Edoff, silverites.
Ex-Congressman Cami.uetti, the only ab
sentee, was confined to his bed by sick
ness. He "had stated to several members
that he wished to resign from the confer
ence committee because of remarks by Mr.
McGlashan coucerning the purity of his
motives.
By courtesy of the committee W. fl.
Alford, chairman of the Democratic State
Central Committee, was ailowed to remain
during tne session, which was strictly
executive. A resolution was passed pledg
ing tbe members to secrecy, and so faitn
fully was this pledge kept that when John
S. Dore was asked by a Call reporter after
the adjournment the name of the cresid
ing officer he refused to fiive eveu tnat im
material bit of information.
The first real business of the meeting
was the announcement by E. M. WardaJJ,
chairman of the People's party State
Central Committee, that he had in his
pocket the withdrawal of A. W. Vann,
People's party nominee for Congress from
the Third District. The committee heaved
a sish of relief at this announcement and
the names of Cutler, Rogers, Patton,
Barlow, Maguire. Castle and De Vries were
rtad off as having tendered their with
drawals.
Section 8 of the plan invited the can
didates to appear before the committee,
ostensibly to Dlace before them all the
facts in connection with their candidacy,
but in reality for the purpose of commit
ting the candidates to an acknowledgment
that the corumiuee nad jurisdiction over
them. Tnen, if the action of the com
mittee hereafter should not suit them,
they would not have any case in court,
having by their presence assented to what
ever the Democracy and the Southern Par
cilic Company might see fit to do with
them.
George W. Monteith, People's party
candidate for Congress from the First
Congressional Districtâ who is to be sup
planted by Mr. Cutler, a Democrat from
Humboldt who is acceptaole to the South
ern Pacific Company â made a lengthy
s-tatement of the reasons why he should
not be removed.
Mr. Monteith felt a cold chill run down
his spine when he appeared before the
committee and he appeared to regard
them with much suspicion. He was cour
teous in his manner and at no time did he
say that he would not tender his with
drawal. He spoke of a secret vote (pre
sumably that of the members of the Amer
ican Railway Union) having been pledged
to him and asked for further time in
order to consult them as to their wishes
in the matter. He said that he would be
willing to lay his case privately before
Joseph Liggett, Democrat, and J. W.
Keegan, Populist, and he would be almost
willing to abide by their decision. He
added that he and his family were in the
most straitened circumstances and that
he really could not afford to make the
campaign, but, notwithstanding that fact,
las wife had urged him to stand by his
honor at all nazards and not to sacrifice it
by withdrawing. % >
"It was suggested that W. P. Lawlor
should be made the third member of the
committee, because in case the two mem
bers should not agree there should be a
third, there being luck in odd numbers
such as 31 to 1 and not in even numbers
such as 16 to 1.
It was agreed that Mr. Monteith should
hand to the committee a written com
munication Tuesday. This was done, no
ciouDt, to entrap him into an acknowl
edgment that the conference committee
had jurisdiction over his candidacy.
Cutler of Humboldt appeared before the
committee and declared himself to be
sound on free coinage. If the committee
should select some one else in his place he
would accept the verdict with resignation,
but as he is on the slate this kind of resig
nation will not give him any mental
panes. He said further that he was not
in sympathy with ex-Congressman Geary's
onslaught on Monteith.
C A. Barlow declared that he could
carry his district by Â» majority of 8000
votes on a fusion ticket, as he was
popular with the laboring classes and
had been defeated for the legislature by a
majority of 18 by the Southern Pacific
Company.
â  Harry Patton expressed confidence in
his ability to carry the Seventh District.
Jud_-c Maguire said that he would with
draw and abide by the action of the com
mittee. - â  ' - â¢
The committee then adjourned until
2:30 P. M. yesterday. '
Mr. Monteith said to a Call reporter
that his position was that the State com
mittees of the parties talcing part in the
fusion did not represent the people in the
Congressional districts directly. He bad
received many letters from his district op
posing his retirement, and be had received
one telegram from the leaders of Humboldt
County Populists requesting him to with
draw. ' All the letters had earnestly re
questing him to remain. He had answered
those letters by declaring; that he would
remain in the fight to the end regardless
of consequences.
Mr. Montieth added: "In all these at
tempts at fusion I don't think that the
railroad question is receiving the consid
eration to which it is entitled, and that
with me is of primary importance, IJ
know that it is the railroad influence that
is seeking to procure my withdrawal, and I
know that but for its influence I should
have received the Democratic indorsement.
I don't see how it is possible for this com
mittee to come to an agreement. The
committee has made me a proposition
whicli it has neither power nor authority
to carry out.
"I fully realize the nature and the power
of the influence arrayed against me, and
as long as I feel satisfied that mv candi
dacy is necessary in the interest of tuose
opposed to railroad monopoly I shall re
main in the field firmly and deter
minedly."
Josepn Kelly was dressed as though for
a walk down the Strand in London. He
cocked up kis chin defiantly as he sur
veyed the committee and sniffed tne air
scornfnlly.
"What did I tell 'em?" said Joe to a
Oall reporter after tie came out, with a
cold, cruel smile on his lip. "I told them
that I wouldn't withdraw because two
years ago I was misrepresented by a
blackmailing sheet, the Examiner,
and I was taicen uown. I now propose to
stay in th.- fight for my own vindication,
and I don't propose to be downed by a
blackmailing sheet.
"McGlashan told me last night that he
wouldn't be turned down, because he had
enough A. P. A. friends on the committee
to keep Marion de Vries from being in
dorsed, and that he told De Vries not to
send in his resignation. I told the com
mittee awhile ago, 'Do you think I am
going to hand in my resignation to an
A. P. A. committee?' *
"You ought to have seen them jump
and howl at that. Landsborough and
Wardall and the rest of the committee
jumped to their feet to deny that they
were A. P. As.
"The last question they asked me was:
â¢Do you think it would subserve the in
terest of silver to have you and Rogers
both remain in the field?' and 1 answered
that I thought it would."
McGlashan was the next to appear be
fore the committee. The burden of his
sorifrwas that he was supported by 8000
A. F. A. votes that De Vries couid not get
because De Vries had a Catholic wife. He
said also that if De Vries remained in the
field Grove L. Johnson would be elected.
Referring to the report that had gone
abroad to the effect that his candidacy was
in the interest of Johnson, Mr. McGlashan
said that the report was not true, for he,
McGlashan, several years ago had suc
ceeded in driving but ot Truckee the
Chinamen who were working for the
Southern Pacific Company.
At 6:20 p. m. tbe committee took a re
cess until 7:30 p. M. for dinner.
The evening session lasted two hours
and was taken ap with hearing the claims
of Castle and Maddux of the Sixth District.
An adjournment was had until 11 o'clock
this morning, when the committee will
proceed to deliberate.
The case of the Third Congrp.sÂ«ional
District was postponed until tne Demo
crats shall have made their nominations
there, which will be next Friday. M. F.
Tarpey, National Committeeman, and
Warren English will seek the nomination
at the hands of the Democratic conven
tion. Mr. Vann has already been nomi
nated by the Populists, but he will be
turned down to make way for Tarpey or
Boclisb.
The fusion slate as it looks now, reads:
First Districtâ Cutler, a Democrat.
Second Districtâ DeVries. a Democrat.
Third Districtâ Tarpey or English, a Demo
crat.
Fourth District â Maguire, a Democrat.
Fifth Districtâ Rogers, a Populist.
Sixth Dinrietâ Madrtox, a Democrat.
Seventh Districtâ Barlow, a Populist.
But the slate will he disturbed by the
intrusion thereon of Monteith in the First,
if his backbone holds out, which is doubt
ful; by McGiashan in the Second and by
Kelly in the Fifth, so that the fusion has
simpiy ended in confusion, the two Popu
lists on the slate being put into districts
where neither they nor the Democrats
would have the remotest chance of defeat
ing the Republican candidates.
PROCEEDINGS YESTERDAY
Kelly, McGlashan and Maddux
Defy the Committee
At the appointed hour yesterday after
noon the committee resumed its session.
It was as executive and as profoundly
secret as usual. The first candidate who
appeared was DeVries, of the Second Dis
trict. He was a favorite with ti.e Demo
cratic six and the silver three, he being
acceptable to the Southern Pacific Com
pany, and the committee beamed upon
him their sunniest smiles. He told them
why lie thought himself to be the strongest
candidate in the field, and when he bowed
himself out he was succeeded by George
W. Monteith.
Mr. Monteith is the People's party
nominee for Congress from the First Dis
trict, but the Democrats and the Southern
Pacific Company do not want him. Hence
his appearance was similar to that of the
liiiuD being introduced to the butcher, to
bleat a mild protest against having his
political brains knocked out with a South
ern Pacific coupling-pin.
Mr. Monteith fell into the trap so cun
ningly laid for him by the committee. He
acknowledged their authority to dispose
of his political claims by placing before
them a typewritten statement. In that
document he agreed to make a confiden
tial statement of his political condition
before Joseph Leggett and J. W. Keegan,
in which ho would confide to them tiie
reasons why he had refused to file his res
ignation, and if they should be satisfied
from the evidence presented before them
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALJL, WEIXNJSSDAi:, SEPTEMBER 2, 1896.
that his reasons were impersonal and un
selfish and sufficient to justify his refusal
they should then report their conclusions
to the joint committee, who, in that event,
would agree to give him the fusion nomi
nation and their support. On the other
hand, if he should fail to furnish those two
gentlemen with sufficient reasons to jus
tify his refusal to withdraw, a vote by mail
should be taken of the delegates to the
late Populist Congressional Convention of
the First District upon the question of his
retirement.
If the majority should vote to have him
withdraw lie would then hand in his
resignation in due form. But if the ma
jority should fail to so vote, then the com
mittee should decide against fusion in the
First District and leave the present nom
inations undisturbed. Before this ar
rangement should be entered Into, bow
ever, the committee should secure full
authority from the respective State Cen
tral committees of the three parties con
stituting the same before anything could
be confirmed.
The foregoing is tbe cist of Mr. Mon
teith's plan. It is a very easy way for
him to withdraw without violating his
pledge, for the plan was doubtless sug
gested to him by an enemy in the mask of
a friend to accomplish his undoing. There
can be no doubt that the Southern Pacific
Company can succeed in elongating the
legs of a majority of the Congressional
convention through Democrats and Pop
ulists of influence who are friendly to the
railroad committee and unfriendly to
Monteith and men of his kind.
Mr. Monteith spoke rather cruelly to
the committee, and insinuated that it
was influenced by the Southern Pacific
Company. The committee was indignant,
and glowered witn ill-concealed hate upon
tbe unconscious back of the strikers' at
torney as he was going out of the door.

AN EX-CONVICT ARRESTED
Trying to Dispose of Some
Jewelry Believed to Have
Been Stolen.
When Searched, a B ack Kask and
Burglars' Tools Were Found
in His Pockets.
Stanislaus Vcniadousky, au ex-convict,
was arrested yesterday afternoon by Ber
jreant Mooney and detained in the "tanks"
at the City Prison pending an investiga
tion.
Voniadousky met H. Livinski yesterday
morning on Clay and Montpomery streets.
They had known each other before Vonia
dousky was sent to Ban Quentin on Feb
ruary 3, 1894, for three years lor burelary,
and when Voniadousky showed Livinski
some turquoise rings and screw diamonds
and offered to sell them Cheap, Livinski
jumped to. the conclusion that Vonia
dousky had been at his old tricks again.
Livinski looked in all directions lor a
policeman, but none was in sight, so he
asked Voniadousky into a saloon and or
dered a bottle of wine, in the hope that an
officer would pass the place. They re
mained there for some time till finally
Livinski asked the ex-convict to go with
him to his store near Ninth and Howard
and de would see about purchasing the
jewelry.
When they got there Livinski telephoned
to the Seventeenth-street station and Ser
geant Mooney, who happened to be in the
station, answered the call. Voniadousky
had become suspicious, and when he saw
the sergeant he mad? a bolt, but was
quickly overtaken and marched to the
City Prison. When searched a black mask,
a pair of nippers, some skeleton keys and
other burglar's tools were found in bis
pockets, besides the jewelry.
When asked where he came from he re
plied in a surly tone, "From the country."
Being pressed to be more explicit he said,
"From San Quentin, as I suppose you will
make it your business to find out."
He was released from San Quentin on
June 14, and the police suspect that some
of tbe recent burglaries have been com
mitted by him. They want an owner for
the turquoise rings and screw diamonds.
Mm. Kllcline May Krcover.
Joseph Kilcllne, the ex-stoker, wHb shot hi*
wife four limes Monday afternoon, appeared
before Judge Conlan yesterday. He was in
structed and arraigned and asked for time to
procure the services of an attorney. The ca^e
was continued for a week. Mrs. Kilcline was
resting comfortably in the Receiving Hospital
yesterday, and Dr. Weil has hopes thai she
may riu 1 throngh, as he does nut think the
bulleia touched any vital spot.
BOXING MATCHES
THIS EVENING,
The Colma Club Has Ar
ranged for Two Good
Entertainments.
TEN - ROUND CONTESTS.
Stelzner Will Handicap Peppers
Fifteen Pounds in
Weight
THE AKERS AND AGNEW BOUT
Young Mitchell Is Negotiating for a
Contest Between Dan Tracey
and George Green.
This evening the Colma Athletic Club
will give a fistic entertainment at the
Grove-streeL Theater, and, although the
match between the erratic Billy Gal-
lagher of Los Angeles and George Green
of the Olympic Club of this City has been
declared off because of Gallagher's im
paired condition, an excellent match has
been substituted.
Jack Stelzner, the pugilist who made
such a very good showing against Van
Buskirk at the National Athletic Club en
tertainment, will try conclusions with
Henry Peppers, who by the way is one of
the most shifty and dangerous fighters of
th' pro:ession. Stelzner will have an ad
vantage of ahout fifteen pounds in weight,
but thfl "hot-stuff" man from the south
says that he never pays any attention to
size or weight, because the larger the man
is the heavier he will fall when hit on the
bullseye, and of course the bullseye,
wt.en a reference is made to prize tight
ing, means the point of the chin, which
vulnerable spot is closely protected by
pugilists who are well drilled in tbe art of
self-defense.
Stelzner is in far better condition now
than when he fought the big Olympic
Club heavy-weight, and his friends, who
are many, are very sanguine that he will
whip Perpers. The latter has very littie
to say, but judging from his past record it
can be safely predicted that he will
astonish Stelzner just as soon as a mix
ture of "fistic punches" will take place.
At any rate the contest should prove very
interesting, as the men have reputations
for pluck~and cleverness, which should
guarantee a bout that will please the
most fastidious seekers of fistic spoit
Another contest which is certain to give
the best of satisfaction is the match be.
tween Lou Agnew and Billy Akers. The
last named pugilist retired about hve
years ago from the ring, and his return
will be welcomed by a host of followers
who have the utmost confidence in Akers'
ability to whip any man of his weight in
America. Billy is unquestionably clever,
and his cool and graceful system of right
ing has always been admired by the fol
lowers of the prize-ring. Agnew is not
very well known to the fraternity, but it
can be said of him that he is as game a
lad as ever stepped between ropes and
should give Chunkey Akers a rattling
good argument in the race for golden
honors.
Young Mitchell received a telegram yes
terday from Hopkins, a theatrical mana
ger of Chicago, which stated that Dan
Tracey, the clever lightweight pugilist,
had consented to fight George Green in
this City, under the auspices of the Occi
dental Club. Green is only too anxious to
meet anybody in a contest of ten rounds,
and as Tracey is a remarkably clever ex
ponent of boxing, a bout between him and
Green would be well worth going many
miles to witness. This will bÂ« one of the
star attractions booked by the Occidentals
for their next entertainment.
Harry Corbett left for New York last
evening with his wife and daughter.
While sojourning in the East Harry will
visit his brother in Asbury Park, where
he will remain for several weeks.
An Egg-Eating Challenge.
The following challenge in egg-eating
has been received and, of course, speaks
for itself:
Pan Fbancisoo, Auk. 26, 1896
Editor Call : Will you kindly stare through
The Call that I will buck John Hurey, the
champion egg-eater of the San Francisco Dis
trict Telegraph Company, against Ernest
Miller, the so-called champion of the Pacific
Const, in an eee->-fttine contest for $25 h side

vour nix dozen at one sitting. I can be found
at 912 Market street, also the raon. y.

WITH CLOSED DOORS.
Preliminary Exam I nation of Frank
Darragh for Grand Larceny
Commenced.
The preliminary examination of Frant
Darragh on the charge of grand larceny
was commence! before Judge Conlan yes
terday morning.
Darragh waa an employe of Lachman &
Jacob, in their wine vaults on Second and
Bryant streets, and is accused of tteuling
a sack containing $985 %hich had been
placed in a bureau drawer in the superin
tendent's office to pay the men's wages.
Carroil Cook appeared for the defendant
and surprised the Judge by asking that
the courtroom should be cleared of every
body except the officers of the court dur
ing the hearing of the case. The Judge
make the order.
The case was not concluded when the
court adjourned.
FORCED INTO INSOLVENCY.
J. J. O'Farrell Made to Assign by
Several Minor Creditors.
Five of the minor creditors of J. J. O'Far
rell yesterday filed a creditors' petition in
involuntary insolvency and so forced Ihe
real estate dealer to assign. The credi
tors signing the petition, with the amounts
dUG them are as follows: Annie Donahue,
$1015; James Regan, $140; Eleanor Martin,
$20; Belle Donahue Bprague, $742 62; and
K. J. Techau, $37 15.
Nearly all the money due the creditors
named is for money collected for rents and
not turned over to them.
The act of insolvency complained of is
that O'Farrell permitted bis property to
remain under attachment for four days.
Transferred to Washington.
Michael A. Heverin, night doorneeper at the
Custom-house, has been transferred to Wash
ington, where he assumes the title and posi
tion of captain of the KU&r4 ot the trea&ury
building. The change is due to the illness oi
the present captain of the guard at tiie treas
ury building. Some weeks ago he applied to
Secretary Carlisle for removal to San Francisco,
whereupon Collector Wi:-e was asked to make a
position for him it possible. He looted about,
and finally settled upon Heverin as the most
available man. The later was more than will
ing to make the change, lor it brings him in
creased honor and a much larger salary. Mr.
Heverin is au old newspaper man, but was
forced to retire from his chosen profession on
account of 111 health. He will leave for his
new post of duty to-night.

some time, and iv consequence was very des
pondent. Further than this therf was no ap

NEW TO-DAY.
Danger to
Young Men,
The chances of total loss of manly power
are so great in men who find slight indi-
cations of a waste in the system that it is
vitally important tnat such indications be
attended to at ance. They should be
checked while such a thing is possible, for
if they are permitted to continue, instead
of stopping naturally, they will become
greater from day to day, and will, in a few
years, completely disrupt the whole nerv-
ous and vital organism.
Young men who notice what they con-
sider light symptoms of weakness do not
realize the danger :hat lurks in their path.
They do not understand the serious conse-
quences, the destruction of nerve tissue,
waste, of vital force and power of brain,
loss of flesh, loss of memory and total
impotency. These are the consequences
that follow in the trail of slight evidences
of weakness.
CORE IT NOW.
To protect your future manhood, to
guard against total loss of vitality, regain
your health now. Wi ile youth is at band
to bring happiness Â»nd joy, such as comes
to the strong, drive away the cause of de-
pression, bring back confidence, bright
eyes and happy disposition. Bring them
back naturally by removing the weakness.
You can do this with

Or. A. T. Sandenâ Dear Sir: The Belt which

Dr. A. T. Sandenâ Dear Sir: When I got your

I got your Belt and had only worn it a month
when I got my strength back so that I could
work hard all day wi then getting tired, and
have been well and strong ever since. It is
the best thing I ever used, and I will always
recommend it. Yours very truly,

NEW YORK MARKETS.

NEW YORK, N. V., Sept I.â The stock market
after scoring fractional declines at the opening in
consequence of the receipts of lower quotations
from London soon developed strencth on the news
that certain linns here imd ordered over $2,000,
-dUO additional gold from nlircal. making the
total engagements up to date over $20,000,000.
The shorts lo^i no time In reducing their con
tracts and an advance of 14 to 1 per cent ensued.
While spec v atiou showed a good deal of strength
it lacked the force which characterized the deai
iuga for several (lavs ims:, and the changed condi
tions were reflected in a sharp decline later on.

14 to 1 per cent. Louisville and Nashville was !
unfavorably affected by the heavy falling off in '
the net earnings 01 the company for the month of ;
July, and Baltimore and Ohio yielded on rumors j
that when the reorganization plan Is made public ;
it would be found that the committee having the I
matter In char c hart decided to levy a he.ivy as- !
sessment on the stockholder*.
Speculat on continued feverish until near the '
close, when It again developed firmness on the de- i
cline of call money ra es from 8 to 3 per cent and
more particular. on the rumors prevalent in the !
exchange thai the Vt-rmon election would give a I
heavy republican majority. Of course the latter
was mere conjecture, but nevertheless ii was made
to do service In the st ck market. Among the
specialties Illinois Central Jumped 2% to 88 and

CHICAGO, IliÂ». Sept. I.â Hardly one minute of
steadiness prevailed in wheat at the opening this
morning, the crowd concluding that sales were
more likely to be profitable than buying in view
of the very heavy receipts reported in the North
west, 1396 cars, as against 2161 for two days last
year and 654 last Tuesday. Business was not of
particular importance, few ou side orders being
received. The deliveries on September contracts
did not prove to be unusually heavy, and the talk
of enormous quantities changing hands, which has
been heard for some time, was not confirmed.
Opening Liverpool cables were quiet and %d
higher. Receipts at Chicago were 306 cars, and
18.150 bushels were taken from store.
Thoman's crop report was out to-day. It esti
mated the yield of winter and spring wheat at
420,000.000 busheK The Oranee Judd Farmer
estimated it a. 480,000,000 bushels. Liverpool
closing %d lower. Pari* was unchanged and Ant
werp lower. Berlin was %@1 mark higher. Ex
port clearances amounted to J59, 175 bushels The

clining moderately, but trade remain. inactive
and devoid of attractiveness. The ;it was for the
most part neglected, the few orders executed
being for small lots and for local account. Re
ceipts were 752 cars and 454.112 bushels were
withdrawn from s ore. Liverpool cables were
weak and V4d lower. Export, clearances amounted
to 877,711 bushels. May corn opened at 25Vg@

' feeling in the market than in either corn or wheat.

ALAMEDA COUNTY WAR.

ALL THE PEOXLES EEFTJSED.
A State Slate Pat Through Without
Opposition When Defeat Is
Realized.
Oakland Ojticx Sas Fraxcisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Sept. 1. j
The generalship and tactics displayed at
the annual meeting of the Alameda
County Politic** Equality Society
afternoon would have done credit to the
oldest and most experienced wire-pulling
lan. The officers and delegates
EDeru four solid hours scheming and talk
ing for the purpose of getting control of
the county organization.
The local society was organized ia July,
1595, with Mrs. Alice Stocker of Sunol as
president, and a full quota of subordinate
officers, all intent on helping in the effort
to secure the ballot for women. Matters
went along nicely, but when the Eastern
contingent of National officers, lecturers
and organizers came to the coast they
brought with them the methods of work
used in their home States and proceeded
to abolish all local plans and substitute
their own.
When they came to Alameda County
there was a conflict of authority and it all
ended by the county society refusing to
have anything whatever to do with the
convention held in the Exposition baild
ing in this city. Further, they refused
therÂ»aiter tc acknowledze any authority
of the State and National organizations,
but wen; so far as to name an executive
committee, which they said was to be the
court of last appeal in county matters.
Tnere were those, however, who felt it
was not exactly right to ignore those who
nad spent a lifetime in the work. This
g^ve rise to two factions, which were
termed the "State" and "county" parties,
cesignatmg those who stood by the old
line workers and those who believed that
there should be no interference in local
work, respectively.
As the time for the annual meeting drew
near there was considerable interest" as to
what should be done regarding the selec
tion of officers. The "county" party waa
entirely satisfied with Mrs.^Stacker's ad
oration, and desired to have all the
officers re-elected. The opposition had
grown strong in this City, however, where
there were many clubs", and they could
not be counted upon as supporters of Mrs.
Stocker, although it Is claimed by her
friends that they never hinted they would
defeat her.
The "county" party went to work with
a will, and have organized or strength
ened the following cluds until they were
entitled to fifteen delegates at to-day's
gathering: N'iies, Snnoi, Pieasanton, Liy
ermore and Centervilie.
Not to be outdone, the -'State" party
brought into the convention clubs from
the Third and Seventh wards, with five
delegates each.
Mrs. Stocker called the meeting to
order at 2 o'clock to-day and named as a
committee Mrs. S. C. Borland, Mrs. L.
Ju :dand Mrs. T. J. Walker.
The first skirmish occurred on the ac
ceptance of this report of the credentials
committee. It favored allowing to all
proxies presented a vote, but it was op
posed by the "jtate" party.
The reason of the opposition can be seen
when it is said that of the fifteen delegates
from the interior of the county only one
â was present in person, all the others hav
ing sent proxies to Mrs. Stocker's per
Eonal friends and backers. After much
-Img and discussion they were re
fused recognition by a vote of 16 to 21.
More time was lost in trying to get this
vote overthrown, but all to no avail.
An informal ballot was next proposed
by the "county" people, and it showed
that the delegation stood 14 to 26 for the
two parties. Every ruse known to profes
sional politicians was exerted to save the
â¢'county'" elate from defeat, but to no avail
as the firs: baLot showed that the "State"
ticket had captured the works by a vote of
29 to 20. Tue full ticket as elected is as
follows:
President, Mrt. Lloyd Baldwfn; first vice
president, Mrs. Maurice Woodhams; second
vice-presiden:, Mrs. Emma Bh after Howard
Oakland; third vice-president, Mrs. LX. Chatv
r.a::. Alameda: fourth vice-president, Mrs
Heury Vrooman, Oakland ; fif tii vice-president!
Mrs. A. A. Moore, East Oakland; recording sec
retary, Maurice Woodhams; correspondiDg sec
retary, Miss Mary E. Keene; treasurer, Mrs. E
G.judd; auditors, Mrs. Judge Wavmire and
Mr*. Archibald Borland.
The retiring officers and the ones which
comprised the "county" ticket were:
President, Mrs. Alice Stocker; first vice
president, Mrs. Emma Shafter Howard ; second
vice-president, Dr. Kelloeg-Lane, Oakland
third vice-president, Mrs. Mary Height, Berke
ley; fourth vice-president, Colonel P. T. Dick
inson, Alameda; fifth vice-president, Colonel
George Babcock, Alameda; recording secre
tary, Maurice VNcodhams; corresponding sec
retary. Mrs. A. E. B. Bangs; treasurer, Sirs.
E. G. Jadd; auditors, Mrs. John Heath and
Hr>. Lloyd Baldwin.
The selection of the county delegation
to the next Ftate convention was left to
the new executive committee.
Miss Susan B. Anthony, president of
the National Political Equality Society;
Mrs. A. A. Sargent, president of the State
society, and Mrs. Ida A. Harper, superin
tendent of tr.e State press work, were
present, and the first two were presented
to the delegates assembled and invited to
seats on the platform with tie president.

politeness â an ounce of respect for a City
Trustee and a pound for an army or navy
officer. The City Clerk, being* a Native
Son of the Golden West, holds all men are
equal in the sight of God and himself, and
addresses them accordingly.
This marked difference in the phraseo
logy employed in couching letters ad
dressed to the president and his sub
ordinates was brought out at a private
sitting of the Board of Trustees after its
I regular meeting last night. The meeting
was for the specific purpose of trying to
find out on what premises Colonel Suter
had arrived at the conclusion that the
completion of the tidal canal was un
necessary and its conception based on
: wrong information.
During the present controversy the zeal
ous City Clerk had written twenty-six let
ters to Federal officers, including the
President, and had only received one an
swer, viz., from the President. He felt as
tonished at this want of courtesy, and the
doctor took it upon himself last night to
point out that his youthful confrere's un
warranted interference in writing these
and addressing them as if they
were private citizens of Alameda instead
of as army and navy officers had done the
cause more aarm tnan good. The City
Cierk was out of the room at the time and
the Trustees sat stnl ana meditated. Not
so t- c City Attorney. He flew to his com
rade's assistance and po:ntei cut that in
writing the letters the City Clerk had only
carried out tbe instructions of the City
Trustee*. Besides, he had at the cost of
52 cents postage obtained more informa
i tion than the doctor had with nine
months' sojourn in Washington at a cost
I of |200 to the city alone. Tne doctor para
j phrased Kipling's expression of that be
ing another story and the committee got
down to work.
Being unable to ascertain the date on
which Colonel Suter based his opinion it
was decided that the doctor should ascer
tain from D. S. Lamont, Secretary of War,
if possible the explicit reasons the colonel
has given why the work should not be
completed. Until the replies come and
are answered it is also requested that all
work on the tiarbor project be suspended.

THE LATE DR. NOBLE MARTIN.
Sketched from life by a "Call" artist during the last session of the.
California Legislature.
son-in-law, Samuel C. Partridge, on Haste
street, comes as a great shock to tne many
friends of the veteran phyncian and legis
! lator. Dr. Martin had served in both of
! the State executive bodies for the greater
i part of the last twenty-five years, and at
; the last session of the Senate, though
nearly 76 years of age, he made one of the
strongest fignts for the rights of his con
stituents during his entire public career.
He came to California in 1352, landing
|at San Diego cm July 4of that year. The
I Senator spent a fe*r years in mining at
| Little York and Red Dog, but not meeting
with tne greatest success at it turned his
attention to the study of medicine.
For the last twenty-five years he prac
ticed at Dutch Flat, and was known
throughout the northern part of Cali
fornia. His practice extended over a dis
trict in radius about twenty miles, and he
kept up his active work until about a year
ago, when he was stricken with heart
failure, from which malady he finally
expired.
Dr. Martin was a warm friend of Senator
George C. Perkins, and when the latter
ran for the United States Senate for the
hrst time, Dr. Martin, though a Democrat
for over half a century, turned from the
paths of Democracy and supported Sen
ator Perkins. belieVing that lie was the
only candidate suited for the position at
that time.
Dr. Martin was visiting his daughters
Mrs. Sam O. Partridge and Mrs. John A.
McLure, in Berkeley when his death oc
curred. He came down from Dutch Flat
Placer County, about a week ago to cele
brate his birthday in Berkeley, as had
been his custom for several years past
He was 76 last Friday. Dr. Martin was
born in New York, August 28, 1320.

Colonel Burton, One of the

in Town.
FAMOUS IN MANY LINES
An Expert Gunner and Discoverer
in Geology and Astron
omy.
HAS BEEN VISITING COOLGARDIE
Says the Gold Mines There Are Very
Rich, bat the Cost of Mining
Is Great.
.Oolonel A. Burton-Brown, a distirr
guished retired officer of the English army
and member of the Royal Geographical
and Royal Astronomical societies, is at
the Occidental.
Colonel Burton- Brown, the Discoverer and Descendant of Marlborongh'i
Leading General.
: Sketched from life by a "CaU" artist.]
The colonel was for some years sta
tioned in Burmah, and at the time KinÂ»
Thebaw was preparing for an onslaught
of tbe British from his strongholds in
Mandelay he made a trip up the Irawaddy
to Mandelay and examined the forts on
the river and defenses of the city. It was
an extremely dangerous trip, and had he
been caught he would undoubtedly have
been tortured to death.
Difficult as the trip was he made it suc
cessfully, and collected a vast amount of
information of much value to the British
forces.
Coionel Burton-Brown has made many
useful inventions in gunnery, to which he
has given much attention. His maternal
ancestor was Sir John Burton, one of
Marlborou.h'3 best-known generals. For
some time in recent year 3he was in com
mand of the Royal Artillery in the Straits
settlements in order to complete the re
armament of Singapore.
The colonel was elected to the Royal
Geographical Society for his cavern ex
plorations on the raised beaches at Gib
raltar, and was made a fellow of the Royal
Astronomical Society for his sun and
nebalr.r observations.
He has just arrived from an inspection
of the gold fields of Coolgardie and Kal
godie. - He had intended joining the
astronomical party in Japan to take ob
servations of the recent eclipse. He was
unable to get there in time, however, so
he recount*, and had to content himself i
with taking some observations from
islands north of Samoa.
For a few days recently he has been at
Mount Hamilton looking through the
preat Lick telescope.
"I was much impressed with the gold i
resources of Coolgardie and Kalgodie," I
said Coionel Burton Brown; "they are
seeminzly inexnaustible, but the country
is surrounded by a desert so great as to !
make mining in every way costly. For i
this reaÂ«on the product must be very j
materially lessened. If there was an i
abundance of water there the gold output !
would be enormous.
"I visited many of the outlying dis- !
tricts, and examined the deposits carefully [
from a geological standpoint. There is ;
almost no limit to to the gold. The only
impediment 12 the great cost of getting it j
out.
"In tiroes past I have hunted s good j
deal in different countries for big game. It
was my intention to remain bere for a
time and hunt some of the game here, and >

FOR PURE REPUBLICANISM.
S. W. MeCall Speaks to a
Large Audience on
Finance.
THE COINAGE QUESTION
EXPLAINED.
Bursts of Applause Make the
Auditorium Ring From Pit
to Dome.
GEORGE A. KNIGHT BERATES
FICKLE VOTERS.
Magnificent Expression of Popular Sentiment in
Favor of the Upholding of an Honest
Financial Standard All Over the
United States.
A large and appreciative audience filled
every available corner in the Auditorium
last night to listen to the eloquence of
Congressman S. W. MeCall and George A.
Knight. The meeting took place under
the auspices of the Republican State Cen
tral Committee and was characterized
throughout Dy a certain high-toned dig
nity and moderation which detracted
nothing from the enthusiasm of the im
mense audience, while it imparted to the
great assemblage a seriousness and pro
priety well worthy of emulation in other
quarters.
L. B. Apsley, whose oratory has made
him a favorite even among those outside
of his party in all sections of the Union,
â was also to have addressed the meeting,
but owing to indisposition was prevented
from so doing. It is hoped, however, that
he will soon become acclimated and en
thuse yet more the already buoyant
minded Republicans with his logic and
eloquence.
Tbe interior of the commodious meet
ing-place presented a sea of faces, male
and female. Stage, orchestra, dress circle,
balcony and galleries were filled with a
throng of refined and deeply interested
auditors. Among them were noticed many
of the foremost society people now in
town, many ladies forming part of the im
mense gathering.
The interior of the building was mag
nificently decorated and brilliantly illu
minated by electricity.
Over the center of the stage hung a life
size portrait of Mr. McKinley, framed in
festoons of red, white and biue silk, span
gled with golden stars. The gallery rail
ings were adorned with graceful hangings
of cheesecloth in the National colors, in
terspersed with shields, banners and like
nesses of the Republican nominees.
From the center of the roof hune a gaily
decorated lantern, from which depended
streamers of red, white and blue bunting,
caught up at symmetrical intervals along
the walls. Aoiati's band of forty pieces
furuished the music of the evening, the
opening selection, the overture to "Semi
ramide," by Rossini, being particularly
deserving of notice by reason of the artis
tic and spirited style in which it was
rendered.
Mr. Knight, chairman of the evening,
opened the meeting by calling upon the
Knickerbocker Quartet for a selection. This
organization has now achieved quite a
name for itself in musical circles, and last
night's work merely affirmed the general
verdict of critics who have heard it.
The quartet comprises the following well
known vocalists: First tenor, D. M. Law
rence; second tenor, Charles Elliott; first
bass, D. B. Crane: second bass, L. A.
Larsen. They sang a comic political Bong
entitled "The Democratic Boat," which
took so well that it had to be repeated.
When the quartet had finished Mr.
Knight said:
The! Republican party to-night is not con
fined to California. We have with us one who
has not only done good work in behalf of Re
publicanism, but who has furnished the key
note and sounded the onslaught for the fray
which made William J. Bryan the nominee of
the Democratic party of this Nation.
However much Democracy may admire its
Btandard-bearer, however much consolation
they may derive from the fact that he is
termed one of the greatest orators of the ago
and though it may rank him with the
Webslers, the Clays and the Calhouns of the
past, the Republican party of this Nation was
the organization that furnished Mr. Brvan
with the metaphor, "Thou shalt not press
down the crown of thorns upon the brow of
labor" [laughter], and '-You shall not crucify
mankind upon a cross of gold."
A pretty conception, a pretty thought when
used aright, and when you take into con
sideration the fact- that all the good, all the
pure rhetoric, all the great statesmanship, has
emanated from the organization of which we
are proud to be members, then it is not sur
prising, it does not strike us as anything oofu f
of the ordinary, that they should filch from
the history and the brains of the Republican
party those things which, when properly used,
should make anybody popular. [Applause.]
The present fight, continued the chair

man, was in effect that of Democracy
against the progressive spirit of the age.
The same old pa?ty was again before the
Nation asking for re - pectful consideration.
Similarly the Republican party as in the
past was eager for the preservation of
right and for the true freedom of the race;
they were devoted to the great principle
which had formerly claimed the earnest
attention of the people of this Republic
He remembered when Lincoln was run
ning for the Presidency some were for the
abolition of slavery, while others wished
to retain it, but every man < who drew an
inspiration from the Star-spangled Ban
ner believed that Abraham Lincoln and
the cause of freedom were one. [Ap
plause.] And now those Republicans who
to-night perhaps did not feel exactly in
accord with the financial platform of his
party and were standing at the street cor
ner discussing silver and considering
whether the gold standard as the Demo
crats put it, was tne proper thing or not,
should stop and think whether the party
that proclaimed, "Praise ye the Lord,"
was really the party to be trusted. The
speaker pointed out the gross absurdity of
a position that could lead a President of the
United States to the conclusion that there
was too much money in the treasury and
induce him to propose that means should
be devised to get rid of it.
Such was exactly the position of Grover
Cleveland. After dealing generally with
several other issues of the campaign, em
phasizing in particular the attitude of the
I Republican party a3 contrasted with that
of its opponents, he introduced Congress
man MeCall in the following terms:
It is my pleasure and it is yours to be present
at a meeting where one who has been honored
by the people of Massachusetts in Congress
one who has done good work foi the Na
-1 tion in the halls of Congress, is to
address you upon the political issues of the
day and to talk to you with the earnestness of
purpose and the diction of a scholar, always a
characteristic of the men from that State
which has done so much for the Nation from
a State which has unified the hearts of mil
lions of people, and has produced the wisest
statesmen, the most cultured gentlemen and
Republicans in this broad land, of which we
are so proud.
I have the honor of introducing to-night the
Hon. S. W. MeCall of Massachusetts who
represents what is known as the "Back Bay"
j district of Massachusettsâ from Bostonâ who
haÂ» delivered addresses throughout the United
States, and he can tell you that California al
though 3000 miles away from the head cen
ters, is in touch with that sentiment which
has made it possible for us to be a progressive
an enlightened people, and has entitled us to
the respectful consideration of other nations
of the world. [Applause].
Hon. S. W. McCall, who was received
with a prolonged round of applause, said :
Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: I am
deeplytouched by the warm and Kind reception
which you have given me this evening. it is
quite in line with what I have been receiving
for the last two or three days. I think it will
require at least six months for me to make ud
my mind as to what 1 think of San Francisco
I have had so many experiences crowded
into the last two or three days that it is im
possible for me to get my bearings correctly or
to know exactly where I stand. I thank you
Mr. Chairman, for your kind introduction'
although the effect thereof Is somewhat
marred by the fact that you hold me up as in
some degree responsible for what the Demo
cratic convention did at Chicago. That is an
honor which I do not aspire to enjoy
[Laughter.] '
I am very glad to address the people of this
great metropolis this eveningâ a great City
not so much on account of what you are, as on
account of what you promise to be [Ap
plausej Not simply great because of your
magnificent environment, nor because of your
harbor, upon which the navies of the whole
world can easily and safely rideâ although
that is glory enough for one city, but because
of your position here upon this sea
coast, the portal through which the commerce
of the great Nation and of the 3000 miles of
splendid territory from here to the Atlantic
Ocean must pour forth, in order to reach the
Eastern and the Southern world. And not
merely that, but If I mistake not, and
Xi we ol > tftil Â» again the prosperity
which we enjoyed under thirty years of Re
public m administration, your achievements
will not be limited to this great ocean upon
which this City so proudly sits, but we will
open to you also the Atlantic, so by that you
may transport through the Nicaraguan canal
Urns"/ 8 of your industry. [Tremendous ap
plause.] v
And let me add that the Democratic ad
ministration has already cost the people of
this country almost twice as much money as it
work* 1 require to complete that great public
I reooenize that with difference of locality
there may be different views of great public
questions, but I think that in the campaign
upon which we are now entering the interests
oi the people of California and of the people of
Massachusetts are identical. You are not
merely benefited as the rest of the country^
benefited, but irom the fact of your position
here-your isolation and relation to
the entire countryâ l believe that thÂ«Â»
is no city or State in the Union which will be
so signally benefited as you will be by the
restoration of a Republican policy. And so
in addressing myself to you to-night I shall
attempt to point out not merely the narrow
gain which ay accrue to you-the bene
nt which this or that particular i nt c,
est will derive.. but I will rather add res s my
remarks to the great benefit that will accrue
! to the whole country and to the enhanced
prosperity that the latter will receive from the
triumph of those principles and that policy
which are represented by William Medley!
[Prolonged applause.] â Â»Â»Â»â¢
Four years ago. after it was shown that the
Democrats had elected their President, the
Senate and a majority of the House of Repre
sentatives we awaited with expectancy the
â¢ realization of the promises of thirty-two years
But the Democratic party had always" been
an opposition party. It had no recordâ at
least, if we do allude to its record we must go
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 2, 1896.
back to the days of James Buchanan, and we
are told that those clays savor of ancient his
tory. The Democrats then came before the
people with promises; we had to fight
promises.
Unfortunately we were prosperous, and
sometimes when people are prosperous they
want to be better off. You have beard of the old
saw about the fool who was well, but wanted,
to be better. He took physic and he died.
[Laughter.] That was our condition then. In
an evil hour the people turned a willing ear
to the fairy tales of the Democratic party.
After four year 3 of maladministration they
do not point with pride to anything they have
done. They do not seem to wish us to con
sider the past. They want the veil of secrecy
drawn over it. They have fallen so much into
the babit of being an opposition party that
they have cut loose from themselves, so to
speak, and denounce themselves, and now
they come before the people with a brand-new
assortment of rainbows and tiak for our sup
port. [Applause.j
I think it would, be a. proper proceeding for
us to look at what they nave done instead of
considering their new remedy, which they
propose for the mischief they themselves have
wrought.
The question of what our policy should be is
one upon which all men should unite and
agree, as our fathers did when they established
the mint, and as they did down to the War of
the Rebellion.
I can recognize and sympathize with the
class which is perfectly sincere in doubting a
line of policy, but I have no sympathy with
those who put forth the Democratic platform
at Chicago and proposed the free coinage of
silver as a measure cf repudiation and of
National disnonor. Mr. Bryan says and
makes an appeal to National pride thereby:
"Is not the country great enough to have bi
metallism at 16 to 1 without waiting for the
consent of other nations?"
That sounds well and may influence a vote,
bat I have simply to say that this great coun
try, however great It may be, is yet not great
enough to suspend a law of gravitation or any
of those great natural laws which no Congress
enacted and which no Congress can repeal.
We are great enough to establish silver
monometallism, If we will, but we cannot
have bimetallism and the free and unlimited
coinage and the use of two metals at a legal
ratio, which materially differs from their
relative bullion value. [Applause.]
I will endeavor to show that Mr. Bryan is
really an advocate of silver monometallism.
The mint was established at the recommenda
tion of that great statesman who aided George
Washington in founding the RepublicâAlex
ander Hamilton. He was a bimetallist and es
tablished the first coinage ratio. But he went
to work like a statesman and not like a Popu
list. [Laughter and applause.] He worked
with his head instead of working exclusively
with his mouth.
If you will read his report on the mint you
will find therein precisely in what way be es
tablished the ratio, not, of 16 to Iâone1 â one would
think that ttie Almighty had ordained that
those should forever be the relative bullion
values of those metalsâ but of 15 to 1. He
made a study of the markets of the world and
discovered that fifteen pounds of silver would
then buy exactly one pound of gold and that
these two quantities were exact equivalents.
This ratio obtained for from fifteen to twenty
years.
It was found, however, in the course of lime
that one pound of gold was worth a little more
than fifteen pounds of silver and as a natural
result thtit gold was being expelled from our
currency and either hoarded or exported. No
man would pay his debts with a gold dollar
when he could get a silver dollar with less
trouble. So we arrivea at a silver basis and
we had no gold.
In 183/t the matter came before Congress and
was caruiully considered by a committee of that
body, which found after another study of the
market* that the ratio was now 15 6-10 to 1.
Consequently a Mil establishing that ratio was
introduced. But somebody â whether a I'opu
list or not I do not knowâ warned an even
number and moved to amend the bill by
making the ratio 16 to 1. That motion car
ried.
So now, while one pound of gold was worth
15 6-10 pounds of silver it was not worth in
the markets of the world quite 16 pounds, and
the result was that silver began to be ex
ported and gold imported. We arrived at a
gold basis. Even that slight difference of
four-tenths of one point was sufficient to ex
pel our silver and to make us a gold mono
metallic people. And from 1834 to 1873, when
the "great crime" was committed, a silver
dollar was only a curiosity.
Here the speaker made a digression in
order to sbow that France, Germany and
the countries of the Latin union had passed
thioueh a similar financial experience.
Continuing he said:
This demonstrates that h the present ratio
were IS or 17 to 1 the Sat of the Government
making :t lti to 1 would put us upon a silver
basis. And it is, therefore, utterly preposter
ous, when the ratio is 32 to 1, to
have the two metals associated side by
side upon equal terms. If Mr. Bryan
is honest he will talk no longer In this cam
paign about being a blmetallisu He will say
frankly: "I am iv lavor of silver monometal
lism and of having this great Nation seceile
irom civilization, from the (treat commercial
nations of the world, from the great countries
of Europe, and rank ourselves by the side of
China and other half-civilized and
heathen nations." [Applause.] But Mr. Bryan
comes to the rescue again with an appeal to
our National pride, or rather to our National
hatred.
The speaker severely criticized Mr. Bry
an's contention that the Republican party
is trying to foist upon the country a Eu
ropean system of finance, and observed
that, though he would personally prefer
an American system of finance, yet he
would Belect a European system rather
than that of an alien and heathen race
like China.
He pointed out that the Republican
party is actually the true bimetallic party,
though it proposes to maintain the ex
isting financial standard until a change
can be effected by international agree
ment. Mr. Bryan's system would lead to
the expulsion of our gold which now did
the work of money. On the other hand
the Republican policy would retain $600,
-000,000 of gold side by side with the same
quantity of silver.
The speaker cited many other conclu
sive arguments to prove the logic of the
Republican political standpoint and to
further emphasize the fact that Mr. Bryan
is really a silver monometallism He
showed how the free and unlimited coin
age of silver would injure nearly every
class in the community â the farmer, the
artisan, the laborer and the policy-holder,
and incidentally knocked the bottom out
of the contention that the Mexican work
man enjoys a greater degree cf prosperity
than the American. The Mexican dollar
possessed only half the purchasing power
of the American dollar.
Mr. MeCall was interrupted by tbe
chairman when half-way through his
speech, and at the latter's request quoted
from a dispatch just received which stated
that the reult of the vote in Vermont
showed largely increased Repuolican
gains. [Loud applause.] After a partial
consideration of the tariff question, so
scrupulously ignored by Mr. Bryan, Mr.
MeCall concluded his magnificent effort as
follows:
If we must have a boy anything give us not
the boy orator but the boy soldier. [Applause.]
Give us the man to-day in the splendid ma
turity of his powers, who when a boy was
willing to bare his young breast to the smoke
and shot of battle in defense of his country â a
statesman of many years of ripened experi
ence; give us the great leader, the great pro
tectionist, the man who holds the honor of his
country as sacred as his ownâ give us as our
next President William McKinley. [Tremend
ous applause.]
At the close of Mr. McCall's magnificent
oration the powerful speaker was cheered
to the echo, being obliged to come to the
front no less than three times and bow his
acknowledgments to the applauding mul
titude. The quartet sang a stirring four
part song, the refrain to which consisted
of tunetul repetitions of the prophecy,
â¢'Protection is bound to win the day."
The band gave an inspiring rendition of
"The Union Forever," after which Mr.
Knight made excuses for Mr. Apsley, and
in bidding good-night to the audience
took occasion to remind all present that
the future weal or woe of the Nation would
be the result of the people's votes.
"Tbe evils that have come near ruining
our country in the near past," he said,
"are all traceable to the misuse of the
ballot. Had the people voted rieht the
country would have been governed right.
They made a mistake and the Nation fell
into a slough of despond and disaster.
"Among those who thus wrongly voted
were some Republicans. Now is the time
for these backsliders and turncoats to re
trace their steps and atone for their folly.
Go home and think about it. Good night."
Mr. Knight is always ' original, but
this novel way of dismissing a
large and cultured assemblage struck
the audience as ludicrously unique, even
for him, and amid mucn laughter and
cheering the gifted orator had to come to
tbe front and make his bow before any
one would go.
"Three cheers for McKinley and
Hobart," cried a stentorian voice from the
orchestra.
Three mighty cheers with a "tiger "
rent the air, and tbe great gathering dis
persed to the inspiring sound of an original
fantasia of American National airs rendered
by the band, many of the patriotic songs
being cau.ht up and sung by tbe people as
tney passed out of the edifice.
BIG RALLY AT INGLESIDE.
Ocean View Joins With the Race-
course Republicans for McKin
ley and the Party.
The Ingleside Republican Club held a
rousing meeting last night. In the ab
sence of J. W. Cook, president of the club,
V ice-President Robert Lee presided.
There were fully 400 persons present.
Robert Ash was the first speaker. He
dwelt at considerable length upon the

Monterey, who ha* already addressed large
meetings at Petaluma and Healdsburg,
was the next speaker. He held his au
dience in close attention while he re
viewed the speeches of W. J. Bryan, and
from an array of facts and figures showed
where the Democratic leader is either
wofully ignorant or willfully false in some
of his statements.
Hon. J. K. Hobbs, Judge Schell, John
Daly and others made short addresses,
after which the Ingleside Glee Club
amused the gathering with some of its
patriotic campaign songs.

Hj Will Dive From Brooklyn

A young all-round athlete at the Lurline
Baths is treading in tta- footsteps of Steve
Brodie â who will soon arrive here â or
rather is diving through the air in the
track of the groat Brooklyn bridge jump
er. His name is Alexander Coblyn, a na
tive of France, 28 years of age. He first
began his career as a diver from the arches
of the Pont Neuf into the Seine when he
was a little Parisian lad, and has kept up
his amphibious plunges ever since.
Coblyn does not drop feet foremost into
deep water, like Biodie and other high
jumpers, but comes down head on, turn
ing at will in the air, and piercing the
surface like a duck. As his hands reach
the water he curves again, which prevents
his body from sinking more than three or
four feet.
At the Lurline Baths yesterday he
mounted to a frail platform close to the
skylight, ninety-nine fett above the great
tank. Theie was only eight feet of water
under him, and it seemed that from that
lofty dive he would be dashed to pieces.
When all was ready he took in a long
breath and ligntiy sprang into the space
before him. His body shot down about
twenty feet, then began to turn. It was a
graceful curve, and before half of the
distance was reached he was completely
reversed, his body vertical, and with
hands stretrhed out and meeting below
his head he struck tne water exactly 3 1-5
i seconds from the instant he left the pint
form. By a fair calculation it can be said
that ii Is 177-pouna body would fall at the
rate of 100 feet in three seconds, descend
j mc sixteen feet the first second, the speed
increasing the remaining two seconds!
As he struck the water he turned into a
horizontal position, sinking only four feet,
and immediately appeared uninjured and
swimming swiftly toward the landing
place.
The diver then climbed to a 75-foot plat
form and gave a number of exhibition
falls. He stood on his hands at the ed^e
of his lofty perch and letting his legs
swing outward over his head whirled in a
complete turn, striking the water head
first. He threw a summersault id the air,
maKing two turns, entering the water
always with a graceful header.
"It is much safer and causes less ill
effects to dive than jump," said he, "if
you can get your bead pointed straight
downward as you strike, because in a iong
descent the blood and t^e body organs
that are more or less movable will iift up
toward the feet and you come down feel
ing all right. A person can think pretty
fast even during the few instances he is
cutting through the air, and whenever I
lind my body getting out of the vertical I
twist myself back into a safe position
again. I have such control over my mus
j cles that I can dive as safely 200 feet as I
i can 100. Dropping from a" great height
! 1 would have plenty of time to get myself
! into shape for the strike. It is easy if one
i has a little neve and knows how to
â  handle himself.
"I am eoinc: East soon to take the 120
-foot dive from Brooklyn bridge. Brodie

jumped it, I believe, but I will dive it, and
if I can get a hUher elevation I will beat
him. I will try any feat in this line where
I have plenty of air to turn in and water
to land in."
Francis Geddes, a lad 16 years old and a
pupil of Coblyn, made a number of grace
ful dives from tMe 75-foot platform under
the direction of his master. He wanted to
attempt the 99-foot drop, but the teacher
vetoed the act.
The two divers went to Stockton last
night, where they will duck into the
slough for the edification of the Admis
sion day celebrators.
