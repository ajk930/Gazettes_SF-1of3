DEMOCRATIC ANXIETY.
Bryan's Vote to Be Weakened
by the Bourbon Sound
Money Ticket
MANY TO FOLLOW VERMONT.
Several States That Were Regarded
Doubtful Will Give McKinley
a Majority.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Sept. 7.âMem
bers of the Republican campaign commit
tee regard as unusually favorable reports
received from Texas, Alabama and
Louisiana, and declare that the sound
money ticket will serve in each of these
States to reduce the Democratic vote.
Nor are the reports from the West dis
couraging, and Minnesota, Wisconsin,
Michigan and Nebraska are considered
safely Republican. These States were
regarded as doubtful at .the beginning of
the campaign.
Senator Gorman was at Democratic
headquarters to-day. Exactly what part
the Senator proposes to take in the cam
paign has been for some time a matter of
speculation. The fact lhat he spent
nearly an hour in earnest consultation
with Senator Faulkner lent substance to a
rumor that he will give the campaign
managers the benefit of his advice. Sen
ator Faulkner was not willing to make
known the subject of their discussion.
The anxiety of Democratic leaders in
creases. They fear that the Maine elec
tion will emphasize the lack of interest in
the silver movement throughout the New
England States. Maine's majority for the
Republican ticket will be, it is appre
hended, proportionately as large as that
of Vermont, and anticipating this some of
the managers are bewailing the mistake
made by the Chicago convention in select
ing as a candidate for the Vice-Presidency
a man who cannot strengthen the ticket
either in hia own or any other State.
Chairman JBabcock of the Republican
Committee said to The Call correspond
ent:
"The Maine election will be a pointer
upon the general situation and prospects
throughout the country. If Maine gives
30,000 Republican majority or better it
will be pretty good evidence of the trend
of public opinion. After all it is the natu
ral trend of aflairs that forms the best ba
sis of estimate. It is like a woodsman
dropping a piece of bark in a sluggish
stream to observe the direction of the cur
rent. The general trend of affairs before
an election, when it becomes known, has
a powerful effect upon public opinion.
You let it become apparent that the tide
is setting a certain way and it swells in
volume by accessions until nothing can
stop it.
"The effect of the Republican victory in
Vermont shows more than anything else
tne truth of this. It has stimulated pub
lic confidence to such an extent that
values in the stock market have appre
ciated more than $100,000,000 in a week.
People are encouiagod to look for sound
money victories in November, business is
stimulated, capital takes new hope to it
self, and there is relief through a Republi
can victory in even one State.
The calm judgment of those, who as
spectators, attended the National Conven
tion of sound-money Democrats at Indian
apolis, is that it was one of the most im
portant political gatherings ever assembled
in this country. There are good and sub
stantial reasons for believing that it will
insure the election of a sound-money Pre
sident. The Republican victory in Ver
mont was unquestionably of significance
as showing how solid the East is for a
sound financial system. But Vermont's
elections do not always influence voters in
the West and South, which will be the
real battlefields of the momentous struggle
for the preservation of the gold, standard.
It was, therefore, necessary to organize in
to an effective protest the sentiment
which exists in these sections against the
proposed debasement of the currency, and
the Indianapolis convention did this more
successfully than it could have been done
through any otner agency.
If it be asked what this convention has
d one the reply is that in every important
State of the West and South it has pro
vided for vigorous and aggressive opposi
tion to theuti-D.'mocratic principles enun
ciated by the Chicago convention. In
Illinois. lowa, Indiana, Missouri, Kansas,
Nebraska. Ohio and California; in the
Northwest, Minnesota, Michigan and Wis
consin, and in the South, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Alabama, Florida and Texas, it
has put the party of silver monometallism
on the defensive, and will weaken it im
measurably oy diverting thousands of
votes from Bryan. This is denied, of
course, by those who are championing the
cause of the Chicago nominees, but despite
their sneers they recognize the handwrit
ing on the wall, for they know that this
convention has deprived him of all
chance of winning some important States
which they had counted upon.
There is an element in the Democratic
party that could not under any circum
stances be induced to vote for a Republi
can, although they woul<i be fully justified
in resenting tne proposed abandonment of
its time-bonored princ pies. To this ele
ment the Indianapolis convention will
address itself with every assurance of
fruitful results. And when the fight has
been made and won the masses who get
their living by hard and relentless toil will
realize that they have been saved from
approving a movement that if successful
would have brought them only suffering.
It is for the purpose of convincing this
class of voters, whose loyalty to party is so
great that they wouia vote almost for tneir

was held.
GOOD NEWS FOR McKINLEY.
Cheering Telegrams Continue to Pour
Into Canton.
CANTON, Ohio, Sept. 7.â Major McKin
ley had something of a holiday to-day.
He read letters and newspapers most of the
morning and viewed t c Labor-day bicy
cle parade from his porch. He was cheered
by those in the parade and so was the
handsome new flag wtjich was unfurled in
honor of the occasion. At noon about
twenty newspaper correspondents called
on Major McKinley to shake han<ls with
him and congratulate him on the manner
in which he is sustaining the continuous
hard work of the campaign. In the after
noon Mr. McKinley took a long drive into
the country.
This evening a number of friends came
in and he and Mrs. McKinley spent the
time in chatting with them and listening
to some vocal and instrumental music.
Several delegations have asked for dates
to-day. Among those expecting to come
to Canton soon is a large delegation of
women from Cleveland.
Major McKinley had a number of callers
this evening. Among them were: J. G.
Johnston of Montana, Representative S.
Harris of Ohio, Colonel Fisher of Denver,
Colonel Wilbur Wakeman of New York,
Colonel R. B. Brown of Zanesville and
Hon. J. M. Ickes of Newark, Ohio.
Among the dispatches received late this
evening were the following:

END OF THE RELAY RACE
The Transcontinental Trip Is
Made in 13 Days 29 Minutes
41-5 Seconds.
Scenes of Great Enthusiasm as the
Pouch Arrives at Its Desti
nation.
NEW YORK, N. V., Sept. 7.â The Jour
nal-Examiner bicycle relay race which
began in San Francisco at noon on August
25 ended in front of the Journal office on
Park Row in this city at 3:29:04 1-5 this
afternoon. The actual time for the race
was 13 days 29 minutes 4 1-5 seconds.
The pouch which has come across the
country contains two letters, one addressed
to Postmaster Dayton from the Postoffice
Department in San Francisco, the other
from Colonel Scnaefer, addressed to the
major-general in command of the Depart
ment of the East at Governors Island.
E. F. Boffinger received the pouch at
Yonkers at 2:23 p. m., and immediately
started for Kingsbridge, accomoanied by
several local riders. At Kinssbridge
Fred J. Titus of the Riverside Wheelmen,
who holds the ten-mile record, received
the pouch, and together with O. S. Brandt
of the same club, they started the last re
lay of the race
Coming throngh Kingsbridge they were
accompanied by 100 cyclists, while Messrs,
Muller and Saunderson, on a tandem
geared to 123, started to pace the riders.
They had not gone far, however, when
the two relay riders left them in the
rear.
At Washington bridge Brandt's wheel
broke down and he was compelled to bor
row one from a member of tue party.
The route through the city was from
Washington bridge down St. Nicholas
avenue to the boulevard, to Seventy-sec
nd street, down Broadway to City Hall
Park and over to the Journal office.
All along the line crowds of wheelmen
were waiting for the riders to pass and
joined in the party that followed, but
they were soon distanced, and when the
two riders reached their destination there
were only seven followers.
On the stand erected in front of the
Journal office were Postmaster Dayton,
A R. Grant, who had charge of the race
ana started the first rider at San Fran
cisco, and W. R. Hearst, proprietor of the
San Francisco Examiner and New York
Journal.
The pouch was opened by Postmaster
Dayton, while the crowd in front ot the
office shouted and cheered. The letter
addressed to him was .found in a
linen envelope, which was covered
with si natures and postmarks of
the Postmasters of the cities throu h
which the pouch was carried. The Poat
master opened the letter and found that it
contained a formal announcement of the
rider leaving Saa Francisco for the pur
pose of establishing a record.
The letter which is to go to Governors
Island wi;l be delivered to-morrow morn
ing at 8 o'clock.

DULY OBSERVED
An Address by President
Debs of the A. R. U.
a Feature.
EMANCIPATION TO COME
Says the Workingman Will Win
the Great Battle for
Freedom.
INDUSTRIAL SYSTEMS DOOMED
Many Celebrations in Which Parades
and Orations Are the Regular
Order.
TERRE HAUTE, Ind., Sept. 7.â The
Labor day celebration here was the largest
both in the parade and the attendance at
the fair grounds on record. President
Debs of the American Railway Union
presided at the meeting and spoke briefly.
After asking what is to be the theme of
Labor day, and saying that if it is low wages
it would require "a Webster, a Clay or a
Bryan to do it justice," Mr. Debs pro
ceeded as follows:
Is it wage-slavery? We behold the managers
of our great railways, trusts and monopolies in
every form engaged In intimidating their em
ployes, giving them to understand that they
muÂ»t vote for their own degradation or suffer
the blacklist ostracism, worse than the Si
berian curse If that is the topic for Labor
day orators it is continental in its sweep. Let
us oelebrate the eternal truth that in America
a toiler is a sovereign citizen; that he holds
the ballot, and if he has the, courage to wield
it as becomes a free man, then, in that event,
Labor day cxpnnds to colossal grandeur and
becomes a iecond Fourth of July. The battle
for industrial freedom has begun.
How fiercely it may wage, or whether it
shall be peaceful or violent, it beyond the ken
of mortal man; but that the hosts of labor will
be finally triumphant is as inevitable as the
ebb and flow of the tides. And yet there are
those wtio refuge to believe that there Is any
conflict, any great wrong to be righted, and
with a zeal and intensity worthy of a better
cause, they uphold the existing order of things
and constantly pour their wrath, upon the
brave and noble few who would rescue op
pressed and suffering humanity from condi
tions which make earth a bell and lite a con
tinuous torture. '
In the bweep of the present industrial sys
tem humanity bag been divided into three
classesâ the capitalistic class, the middle class
and the working class. The capitalistic class
represent* 9 per cent of the population and has
71 per cent of the wealth ; the middle class rep
resents 34 per cent of the population and has
24 percent of the wealth, while the working
cia-s, representing 52 per cent of the popula
tion, nas 5 per cent of the wealth. Not only
this, but the workingman of to-day lives by
permission. If he dare protest his master
doomi his wife and chi dren to starvation.

OTHER CELEBRATIONS.
Imrtje. Parades Throughout r the State*
.." . and Canada. ,
> CINCINNATI. Ohio, Sept. 7. -Labor
day was celebrated here in the usual man
ner. About 3000 men took part in the pa
rade this morning, representing the differ
ent, trade unions. The afternoon and
evening were spent at the different re
sorts.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Sept 7.â Labor
day was universally observed. All the
â¢shops and factories were closed. The
weather was delightful. The parade of
the labor unions in the Jmorning was the
grandest in the history of Cleveland.
Twelve thousand men were in line.
DETROIT, Mich., Sept. Labor day
in this city was more generally observed
to-day than ever before. There was a
parade of labor unions in the morning in
which more than 10,000 working people
participated. After the parade the labor
unions went to Belle Isle Park, where a
lon programme of games was run off in
the afternoon. . ;. '
BOSTON, Mass., Sept. 7.â Labor day was
celebrated' to-day somewhat more exten
sively than usual. The weather was clear
and cool and the procession was the
largest ever, Been here on a similar occa
sion. The day was observed iv various
other ways, chiefly outdoor sports, pic
nics, etc. .
f NEW YORK, N. V., Sept. 7. -Labor day
was generally observed ,in thin State. All
the .exchanges, and banks were closed,
while business was more generally sus
pended than on any occurrence of the day
in preceding years. The weather was cool
and clear and well adapted to the many
outdoor games scheduled among the day's
amusements. -
The attendance at the parade last year
was so small that it was decided by the
committee having the matter in charge to
abandon it this year. The architectural
ironworkers was the only organization
that paraded to-day.
In Brooklyn the day was observed in a
manner similar to that in this city. .
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Sept. 7.â Labor day
was observed in the usual manner. The
Allied Trades associations held a joint
parade at noon and marched to Concordia
Park .to listen to speeches and witness
athletic games.
OMAHA, Nebb., Sept. 7.â Labor day
was observed in this city generally but
was devoid of demonstration,; barring a
picnic at Syndicate Park :at which ad
dresses were made by Governor Holcomb,
Mayor Broatch and Edward Roaewater of
Omaha and 8. G. Kent of Lincoln. The
mention of Mr. Bryan's name was cheered

GLARING FRAUDS
ARE COMMITTED
Democrats Run Things as
They Please Down
in Arkansas.
RULE' OF THEIR JUDGES
Election Returns Tampered With
in Twenty Counties of
the State.
JONES IS ELECTED GOVERNOR.
Several Clashes Occur in Doubtful
Sections Between Bourbons
and Populists.
LITTLE ROCK, Abk., Sept. 7.âRe
turns at midnight from the election in
this State are as yet very incomplete on
account of the length of the ticket. The
count is progressing slowiy.
Telegrams received from the interior np
to this hour indicate an increase in the
vote of two years ago and an increase in
the Republican vote of lrom 40 to 50 per
cent over the vote of two years ago. The
Republican State Committee issues the
following statement:
In at least twenty counties of the State
the Democracy have used the election
machinery In a most fraudulent manner.
The law prohibiting the selection from
one political party of more than two out
of three judges of election in each voting
precinct has been openly violated.
In some of the counties the Election
Commissioners have appointed none but
Democratic judges. In the counties
where tnese judges are in absolute control
of the election machinery the mo>t glaring
frauds are reported to-night. From mea
ger returns received from counties in
which Republicans had representation on
election boards, Remmell, R publican
candidate for Governor, received a largely
increased vote over bis vote of two years
ago.
Owing to the large number of counties
beyond the reach of telegraph and tele- j
phone facilities the returns from to-day's j
election are slow in reaching headquar
ters. Semi-official returns received from
fourteen of the principal counties of the
State give Daniel W. Jones (D.), free sil
ver candidate for Governor, a plurality of
18,000. The Populists scratched Files,
their candidate for Governor, and voted
almost solidly for Jones, as did many of
the sound-money Democrats, wno voted
at all. The prohibition vote throughout
the State shows a marked decrease.
The count an to 10 o'clock to-night
gives the license people 650 majority and
it is now believed that the total vote of
the county will increase this to 1800.
Several clashes occurred in the doubtful
counties between tee Democrats and
Populists. Notably was this the case at
Clinton, Van Buren County, the place
where Congressman Dinsmore was assault
ed last week. Clinton is twenty-five miles
from the nearest telegraph office and it
is impossible to learn full particulars, but
it is thought here that no serious results
came of the riot. White County, the
birthplace of the Populists, has gone
Democratic, while Newton, Searcy and
Madison have rolled up their usual Re
publican majorities for legislative and
county offices. This county, the largest in
the State, polled 6000 votes, and the Demo
cratic majority will reach 3500. The Re
publicans had no ticket in the county, the
opposition being an independent ticket
composed of men a majority of whom are
but little known.
Official returns received from the fol
lowing counties late to-night gave Jones'
majorities as follows: Miller (Texarkana),
600; Phillips (Helena), 1100; Woodruff,
1900 out of a total vote of 2500; Franklin,
800; Lafayette, 500; Sharp, 1700. If these
majorities are kept up throughout the
S:a - e Jones and the entire Democratic
ticket will receive 60.000 majority.
PLOT TO BREAK JAIL
Timely Search Â»f Their Cells Prevents
the Escape of Pearl Bryan's
Murderers.
CINCINNATI, Ohio, Sept. 7.â A negro
prisoner named Walker was searched last
night by a turnkey in the Covingtou jail
and a 38-caliber revolver was found in his
pocket
Walker occupied a cell adjoining the
ones occupied by Jackson and Walling.
The jailer suspected a plot to break jail
ard ordered the cells searched. In Wai
ling's cell half a dozen saws were found.
Both Walling and Jackson protest their
innocence, but the jail officials think the
plot was to have been carried out at 6
o'clock this morning, when only two men
would be on guard.
A search of Jackson's cell this afternoon
disclosed two fine steel saws hidden be
tween the sole and lining of an extra pair
of tan shoes which belonged to the i ris
oner. The revolver found in Walker's
pocket has been positively identified as
one owned by Walling before his arrest.
A rigid investigation will be made as to
how it got into Walker's possession.

The Bimetallic Party Secretary Urges
Sixth District Voters to
Defeat Him.
Los Angeles Office of The Call,)
328 South Broadway, >
Los Angeles, Cal., Sept 7. J
The following open letter by Alva
Udell, secretary of the American Bimetal
lic party in California, will form the basis
for a protest against the candidacy of C.
A. Barlow for Congress in this district,
which, it is expected, will be numerously
signed by Democratic, Populist and Bi
metallic voters prior to the meeting of the
Democratic County convention.:
To the Members of the Democratic Congressional
District Committees of the Sixth Congressional
District and to the Delegates to the Democratic
County Convention of Los Angeles County, Cal.~
Sirs: In the thirtieth Legislature of Califor
nia the Democracy had 59 members, the Re
publicans 52 members, the Populists 8 memÂ«
bers and the Non-Partisans 1 member.
The membership of the joint assembly being
full, it required sixty-ons voles to elect a
United States Senator for the term beginning
March 4, 1893. It appears that among the
Populists in said Legislature were Aaron Bretz,
elected from Alameda County, and Charles A.
Barlow from San Luis Obispo county, both of
whom, to secure their election, hid given the
Democrats of their respective counties certain
specific pledges, made orally or in writing, and
of which the following is substantially a copy:
Aukeda, CaL, 10-27-92.
To the executive committee of the Democratic del*
gation of the Forty-seventh. Assembly District of
Alameda County, CaLâ Messrs. : I hereby pledge
myself to your delegation that I will, if elected to
the Assembly from this district, support the Dem
ocratic caucus nominee for the United States Sen
ate, in case it is not possible to elect the People's
party nominee.
This pledge is made and delivered with the un
derstanding that it shall be made public in no casÂ»,
except that I fail to keep it. It Is also understood
and agreed by both parties that It shall remain in'
the possession of the Alameda Democratic Club, '
and if 1 am not elected It is to be returned to ma
immediately after the election, and if I am.
elected It is to be returned to me as soon as I have
voted for the Democratic nominee. A. Bbktz.
I am credibly inrormed, and stand ready to
prove by my informants, that Charles A. Bar
low made substantially the same pledge as
above to the Democrats of San Luis Obispo
County during the election campaign in the
year 1892. It further appears that said
Charles A. Barlow, after being eiected
to said Legislature, but before the same had
convened, and with intention to act and vote
in violation of his pledge above mentioned,
did sign, together with all the People'a party
representatives, an agreement to vote upon
all political matters as a unit, uDon the agree
ment of a majority, in the words and figures
following:
December 31, 1892.â We, the undersigned mem
bers of the Legislature, In People's party caucus
assembled, do hereby pledge onrse yes to each
other that during the thirtieth session of the
Legislature we will, in all matters wherein the
principles of the People's party are Involved, act
together as a unit and be governed in each action
by the will of a majority of the caucus, expressed
by a majority vote therefor.

A. Bretz.
M. Thohab Jr.
W. A. VAMM.
T. J. Kkrns.
C. F. Bennett,
P. K. Adams.
H. J. T. Jacobsev.
It also appears that on January 12, 1893, the
members of the People'a party caucus above
mentioned nominated one Thomas V. Cator
for the United States Senate, to be voted for by
said joint assembly, in which, the Populists
having but eight votes, it does not appear how
they could expect to elect their candi
dates, unless they secured for him the
united strengtn of the forty-two Republicans,
whose votes could not be obtained without the
consent of the Southern Pacific Company of
Kentucky. Under such circumstances it
clearly meant a sale of the People's party
candidate to that corporation to secure his
election to the Senate, and it is
idle to assume that the Democrats, with,
only two votes to obtain, would have
broken away from their candidate, when
they held the specific pledges of more than
enough Populists to elect him. Iv view of
these facts Mr. Kerns, on the 18th of January,
1893, gave his vote to the Democratic candU
date and elected him to the Senate of the
United States. Neither Barlow norÃretzcver
voted for the Democratic nominee, but the
action of Mr. Kerns in so voting caused Mr.
Bretz to charge the corrupt use of money to
secure the election of said Democratic Unitud
Slates Senator.
, It also appears that by an almost unanimous
vote the Assembly of said Legislature on Janu
ary 19, 1893, adopted the following::
Resolved, That a select committee of seven be ap
pointed by the Speaker of the Assembly to fully
investigate tbÂ« charge and words us<"d b.- Assem
blyman Bretz In the joint assembly for the
elec lon of United States Senator on January
18. 1893, wherein Mr. Brcntz used the woraa
in joint assembly as follows, to wit: "We believe
tnisciiange was brought about by the corrupt use
of money, and we believe that Marion 'Jannon waa
the negotiator"; and that said committee Is fully
empowered to investigate aaid charge; to send for
persons and papers and is required to report to the
Assembly the results of its investigation.
It also appears that on January 30, 1893,
said Assembly, by a vole of 60 to 16, took ap
propriate action providing for the censure of
Mr. Bretz, and suspended him from participa
tion in their deliberations for a period of
one week. This sentence was imposed
in pursuance of the unanimous finding
by said committee that the charge made by
Aaron Bretz "was false and untrue in every
respect" and "that not the slightest taint of
corruption or wrongdoing in any respect at
taches to either Hon. Marion Cannon or Hon.
T. J. Kerns in the matter of said election of
said United States Senator."
These findings were concurred in by the
Populist member of said select committee, and.
all the Democratic and Republican members
thereof recommended that Mr. Bretz be ex
pelled from the Assembly and his seat therein
declared vacant.
It also appears that in making the un
warranted and infamous accusation that2
a Democrat had been elected by
the corrupt use of money Aaron
Bretz was seconded and support*! by
Charles A. Barlow; for, on the evening of the
same day on which the false accusa
tion in the ioint assembly was made
Mr. Barlow was the first Populist to
sign, out of alphabetical order, cer
tain unwarranted resolutions denouncing the
means by which said Democrat was elected to
the United States Senate as" "false and treason
able and an outrage, humiliating and dis
graceful, and an infamous wrong to over a
-mUlion voters of the Nation now struggling to
enact measures which alone can save the
Nation from terrible evils.'
It further appears that on August 15, 1896,
said Charles A. Barlow was nominated as the
candidate of the People's party in the Sixth
Congressional district, and tUat a certain
joint committee in Han Francisco, claiming to
reprt-ssnt t!ie Democracy of said district, have
indorsed or nominated said Charles A. Baflow
as the Democratic candidate for Congress in
said Congressional district.
Wherefore,' and in view of the facts herein
set forth, I respectfully submit that said
Charles A. Barlow has not only forfeited the
confidence of the Democratic electors of said
district, but he has proved himself unworthy
the support of any citizen, be he Democrat,
Republican or Populist, and I hereby protest
against his nomination and election.

A Leading German Editor Denounces
the Bryan Democracy
i SAN DIEGO, Cal., Sept. 7.â The Hon-
C. H. Lienau, editor and proprietor of the
Yolks Zeiturig, at St. Paui, the greatest
German daily of the Northwest, is in. the
city. For thirteen years Mr. Lienau was
in the Minnesota Legislature, as Repre
sentative and Senator, and he has, per
haps, the greatest influence of any Ger
â¢ man in Minnesota. At present he is re
siding at Rediands, in this State, leaving
the management of the paper to his son.
"I have been a Democrat all my life,"
; paid Mr. Lienau to-day. "I was a Presi
dential elector for Fremont, in 1856, and
have been a Democrat ever since. But I
am not for Bryan. My paper will never
support any man who advocates a repudi
ation of the National debt or anything
that hints of National dishonorin finances
or in anything else. lam an out-and-out
McKinley man, and my paper is an out
and-out McKinley paper. ,< Naturally it
has- considerable influence as the only
i German daily in Minnesota.
"Minnesota," continued Mr. Lienau, "is
safe for McKinley. That State has a
large proportion of naturalized citizens
in it and they perceive more clearly some
how than the native Americans what
great need there is for a Inch protective
tariff and sound money in this country.
Men who were born and raised in the Old
World know what low wages mean, and
. they know a good thing in the United
j States when they see it. They are op
posed to anything that will reduce wages
' to the standard they know so weil in Eu
rope, They are in favor of a dollar that is
a dollar, and when they work hard for
their money they want it to be worth
something. That is the reason why Min
nesota is safe for McKinley."
"What is your opinion of California?"
"Well," replied Mr. Lienau, "when I
first came out to the coast i perceived a
rabid silver sentiment. Everybody
seemed to be inoculated. But the in
formation that has come during the cam
â¢ paign has taught voters more about the
. money question, and the more they study
it the iess they are for silver. ' I see a
rapid reduction in the number of silver
. ites and a decided abatement in the ultra
' views of those who still espouse that cause.
If the campaign would only continue six
months you would not find as many sil
verites as there are prohibitionists now.
1 The campaign of education is bringing
them around to McKinley and sound
' money. They are seeing plainer every
' day that prosperity cannot be attained by
â¢ 'monkeying' with the stability of the
money of the country. They were crazy
J lor a change, and when silver was sprung
I they went lor it open-mouthed; but now
f they are seeing their error. By Novem
â¢ ber I expect to see an immense falling off
in the adherents of the silver craze and the
defeat of those who still cling to that
fallacy."
NEUNRE'S REPUBLICAN RALLY.
Auspicious Opening of the Campaign in
the Alatif-da County Village.
NEWARK, Cal., Sept. 7.â The Repub
lican campaign opened here with the or
ganization of a McKinley and Hobart
Club, seventy-five strong, and a rousing
meeting at Watkins Hall, which was
crowded to suffocation. Old-line Demo
crats figured conspicuously in the audi
dience.
County Central Committeeman C. M. C.
Peters of Niles called the meeting to or
der. After stating its object to be the or
ganization of a McKinley and Hobart
Club, and that a similar club would be
organized at Niles on Saturday evening,
when Hon. J. T. Dare and Hon. Louis
Titus, of San Francisco, would address the
citizens of Niles and vicinity, he intro
duced the chairman of the evening, J. B.
Terrill.
Chairman Terriil Â»j.med the following
vice-preÂ«idents: John Dugan, F. C. Jar
vis. W. F. Pike, James W. Clark, W. H.
Ford, Senator J. L. Beard, James Black,

Short addresses were delivered by Sena
tor J. L. Beard and F. E. Smith. Hon. S.
J. Duckworth of Monterey spoke for an
hour and a hall devoting his attention to
the money and tariff issues.
His address was a masterpiece and won
much applause- Every reference to Mc-
Kinley and protection wa9 loudly cheered.
To-night's meeting marks the inaugura
tion of an aggressive campaign in this part
of Alameda County, from which great re
sults are expected.
MAQUIRE MEETS A FROST.
Addresses Aot Over a Score of People at
the State Fair.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Sept. 7.â lf the
reception accorded to Congressman James
G. Maguire at the Agricultural Pavilion
this morning, when he appeared to advo
cate free coinage, is to be taken as a cri
terion of the interest displayed in that
subject by the people of Sacramento city
and county, then Bryan, the champion
of that theory, will have to look to other
portions of the State for the alarming ma
jority which the Democrats are boasting
he will obtain. Maguire : s reception was
frosty In tbe extreme. There were scarcely
more than a score of people present, and
these seemingly preferred to stroll around
among the exhibits and admire the agri
cultural products, the glittering array of
stone and tin ware, or the floral beauty of
the conservatories to sitting and absorb
ing ihe utterances of this polished master
of the Saxon language, as he explained to
them the dire necessity of extending for
another four years the rule of the party
of closed factories and products unsalable.
The respect which Maguire has inspired
even among his political enemies in this
city is too well known to permit the belief
that the luck of interest and the paucity
of audience could be attributed to the
speaker's unpopularity. It was tbe policy
be advocated that induced the frost. His
failure to obtain the audience of the people
of Sacramento County but proves that the
people of this section are flocking to the
standard of McKinley and protection.

than General Grant obtained over Greeley.
"Why, nobody knows better than Chair
man Jones that Bryan can't be elected,"
Apsley observed.
Of the situation in California McCall
said : "The people of that BtatÂ« appear to

OAKLAND'S NEW MINISTER
Rev. C. R. Brown of Charlestown,
Mass., Accepts a Congre
gational Call.
Will Marry One of His Flock Before
Leaving for His New Field
of Labor.
BOSTON, Mass., September 5. â Rev.
Charles R. Brown, for the last four years
pastor of the Winthrop Congregational
Church of Cbarlestown, surprised his con
gregation to-day by resigning the pastor
ate and announcing that he had accepted
a call to the First Congregational Church
of Oakland, Cal. He will marry a Charles
town lady just before he leaves. The fol
lowing is Mr. Brown's letter in part:
I now desire to tell you that I have recently
been called to the pastorate of the First Con
gregational Church of Oakland, Cal. This
offer has come to me entirely unsought. I
have never even visited the field or met a
single member of that church. It stands
among the larger churches of our denomina
tion in a position of wide influence on the Pa
cific Coast and affords the greatest oppor
tunities for active service.
It is my feeling and the feeling of my friends
who are acquainted with tbe facts that I
ought to enter this opening. For many weeks
I have made the question a subject ot prayer,
and I am now firmly persuaded that my pres
ent duty lies in this Meld in the far \VeÂ«t.
I therefore hereby resign my office as pastor
of the Winthrop Church, to take effect Septem
ber 22, 1896. I ask you to consider this
resignation at an early date, and to join with
me in calling an ecclesiastical council for my
dismissal. I trust no effort will be made look
ing toward any reconsideration of this step,
for no further aciioji on your part could add
to the deep appreciation I already have of the
generosity and kindness you are so ready to
show your minister.
Mr. Brown came to Charlestown from
Cincinnati and this is his second pastor
ale. He is a graduate of the university of
lowa and Boston University. Mr. Brown
will close his connection with the Win
throp Church September 22, and go direct
to Oakland, beginning his work there Oc
tober 1. Before he leaves Cbarlestown he
is to be married to Miss Alice Tufts, 21
Oat street, the daughter of George F.
Tufts, treasurer of the Warren Institute
of Savings. He is to labor in his new
field through the fall and winter, and the
middle of February will start upon bis
wedding journey, visiting Egypt, Pales
tine and Europe.

BILL'S JAW WORKS
ON LABOR DAY
Workingmen of Chicago
Turn Out to Hear
Bryan Talk.
BIG CRUSH IN A PARK.
Thousands Jourcey to the Wooded
Pleasure Resort to Listen
to a Speech.
TAFFY FOR WAGF.-EARNEES.
Will ie," "Billy. Old Boy," and "Hon.
orable Bill" Are Terms Applied
to Bryan by the Crowd.
CHICAGO, 111., Sept. 7.â The celebra
tion of Labor day by Chicago workingmen
centered mainly in the meeting addressed
by William J. Bryan at Sharpshooters
Park, a wooded pleasure ground situated
at an inconvenient distance from the city.
The street railway service was not of the
best, and many people were unable to
reach the park. Every car that ran to the
grounds was packed from noon until after
2 o'clock, and those who went by that
means suffered much discomfort. The
day was all that could be desired in point
of weather, a little too warm for tne close
contact of human beings, but practically
perfect for outdoor assembly.
Mr. Bryan spoke from a permanent plat
form, with a shell-shnped canopy, and
long before the meeting began this was
crowded by prominent labor unionists,
many with their families. The crowd began
to gather about noon, and those who came
early sought positions close to the front of
the stand. Many men and boys climbed
trees overlooking the platform and were
able to see and hear the better from iheir
exalted positions. Occasionally the limb
of a tree broke and added to the fun and
excitement of the occarion. Other men
climbed to the roof of the stand, and
lying nation their stomachs peered over
the edge on those below like so many
human squirrels.
The crowd was not as great as had been
expected. Before Mr. Bryan entered the
park about 6000 people were clustered
around the central point of interest, but
after the appearance of the nominee 3000
or 4000 more entered ihe grounds and
waited to catch a glimpae of the Demo
cratic nominee or stood on the outskirts
0 f the audience endeavoring to hear what
he said. The charge of 25 cents for ad
mission unjustly served to decrease the
attendance.
The ceiebration at the park was the
annual picnic of the Building Trades
Council, a representative organization of '
men employed in building trades. The
crowd which gathered was essentially one
of workingmen and their families. They
enjoyed the address of tbe nominee with
unconstrained freedom ana made frequent
comments of an amusing character that
several times had the effect of making Mr.
Bryan break into a laugh which spoiled a
rounded period. The crowd was exceed
ingly disorderly in a good-natured way.
Frequent appeals were necessary to ob
tainquiet. Two or three times tbe jam
nÂ«*ar the stand became ?o great that sev
eral women fainted and were trodden
before being rescued and revived. Mr.
Bryan once appealed to the people to
stop crushing and stopped another time
to band a glass of water to be passed to a
fainting woman.
Mr. Bryan was received with long-con
tinued applause, and throughout his ad
dress of an hour's duration he was treated
with the utmost good-natured familiarity.
The crowd called him "Willie," "Billy,
old boy," and "Honorable Bill," and told
him to "Hit 'em again" and^to "Give
them another" whenever he caught the
fancy olhis audience.
It was a few minutes after 2 o'clock
when Mr. Bryan's carriage reached the
park, followed by several otbers carrying
labor leaders and their wives. Seated
with Mr. Bryan were Edward P. Carroll,
president of the Building Trades Council,
J. D. McKinley, presideut of the Carpen
ters' District Council, and J. J. Ryan, a
local labor leader. In another carriage
was Dr. Theodore Barth of Berlin, a mem
ber of the Qerman Reichstag, who ar
rived in this country four days ago to
study the politics of a Presidential cam
paign. He met Mr. Bryan at the Audi
torium Hotel, and was invited by him to
axtend the meeting.
Mr. Bryan's carriage was followed from
the roadway through the grounds to the
platform by a cheering running crowd of
men and boys. There were no police offi
cers to restrain them and they almost
felled Mr. Bryan in their eagerness to
grasp his hand and say something com
plimentary. By dint of muscular work
Mr. Bryan was able to reach the platform
and smiled his thanks when the thousands
cheered him lustily.
At the conclusion of Mr. Bryan's speech,
which was the only one made, there was a
repetition of the unrestrained crush on a
larger scale in the rear of the platform,
where the speaker tried to get away in his
carriage. Hundreds pushed on in front of
him and grasped his hand whether he
liked it or not, and there was a delay of
fifteen minutes before a passageway could
be cleared. Hundreds rushed on the plat
form in their mad eagerness to get near
the nominee, and there was imminent
danger of a collapse. The police finally
got around and into Mr. Bryan's carriage
and drove oft tbe people who clung to the
vehicle until the road was reached.
President Carroll, who acted as chair
man, quickiy saw the crowd was in no
mood to hear a speech from him and
merely presented Mr. Bryan, who said:
Ladies and Gentlemen: I desire to thank the
Building and Trades Council for this oppor
tunity which they have extended me of speak
ing to the people assembled on Labor day.
Labor day has become a fixed event among our
institutions, and it is well that it is so, be
cause on this day ail over this Nation those
who are engaged in the production of wealth
meet in order that they may commune with
each other, discuss those questions in which
they are especially interested and emphasize
before the world that there is nothing dishonor
able in the fact that one earns his bread In
the sweat of his face.
I am glad to stand on this day In the pres
ence of those to whom this Nation is so largely
indebted for all that it has had, for all that it
has now and for all that it can hope to have.
1 am not indulging in idie flattery when I say
to you that no part of the people of the world
are no important to the welfare of mankind as
those whose labor and brains convert the nat
ural resources of the world into material
wealth. I might quote to you what Mr. Car
lisle said to those people in 1678, when he de
scribed them as the struggling masses who
produced the wealth and who paid the taxes
of ihe country. He did not praise them too
highly. The struggling masses not only pro
duce the wealth and pay the taxes In time of
peace, but the struggling masses have ever
been and must ever be the Nation's surest pro
tection In time of peril.
The speaker then took from his pocket
the copy of an address by Abraham Lin
coln, delivered in Congress, from which
he quoted certain paragraphs, one of
which called attention to an effort made
to plaoe capital on an equality with if not
above labor in the structure of Govern
ment, and following with the assertion
that capital is only the fruit of labor and
could have never existed without it. "La
bor," said Lincoln, "is superior to capital
and deserves much higher consideration."
Mr. Bryan followed with a quotation from
Solomon and continued:
Solomon favored neither poverty nor riches.
He regarded that condition best which is not
at either extreme, but lies between the ex
tremes. Neither great riches nor abject pov
erty furnish us the soil in which grows the oest
civilization. Those who are pressed by pov
erty lose the ambition, the inspiration, the
lofty purpose that are necessary to lead one on
to the 'greatest achievements, and those who
possess 100 great wealth lose the necessity for
laborâ mat labor which is absolutely essential
to the development oi that which is best in
human nature.
Solomon was right therefore when he
praised this intermediate condition, for the
great middle classes are the bulwark of society,
and from the middle classes have come almost
all the good that has come to bless the human
rnce. Let me call your attention to the fact
that when the meekand lowly Nazarene came
among men aud preached peace on earth and
Goodwill toward men he was not welcomed by
those who are described as people who devour
widows' houses and under pretenses made
long prayers; but when he gave that great
commandment. "Love thy neighbor as thy
self," who listened to him? The Scripture tells
us it was the common people who listened to
his commandments and who welcomed him.
It is the createst compliment ever paid to the
Master. Tne Scriptures say the common people
heard him gladlyâ and the common people are
the only people who have ever heard gladly
any man who preached humanity and equal
rights. [Prolonged oheers.J
I don't mean to say that lhere are no excep
tions to the general rule. There have always
been found among the richer classes those
who are filled with the spirit of philanthropy.
There have always oeeu found among them
those who were willing to spend their lives in
the uplifting of their fellows, but I am speak
ing of the rule that reforms do not come which
are not supported by those who consider them
selves lifted above the common people. Nor
do 1 mean that you have never found among the
commou people those who would betray their
fellows. You have found everywhere in every
stage of society the character of Judas. Yet
still in spite of this the common people have
been the greut and telling force that has lifted
civilization to a higher ground. There are
three forms ot Government best known among
men. There is the monarchy, where the king
rules by right divine; there is the aristocracy,
where a few control, and there is the democ
racy which means the rule of the people them
selves.
yWby is it that the strength of democracyâ l
don't use the term in a party sense, but In the
broader senseâ why is it that the strength of
democracy has always been found among the
common people? It is simple enough. If a
man has high position or great wealth he may
be able to stand and keep on the good side o*f
the king; if be has great influence he muy be
one of tne ruling classes in the aristocracy.
But you are not willing to leave any form of
government to your children except a de
mocracy in which each citizen is protected in
the enjoyment of life and the pursuits of hap
piness. ThÂ«; great common people believe in
a democratic form of government because it is
only in the democratic form of government
that they are able to protect their rights and
defend their interests so far as government
can defend a man's interest. Let me dv?ell lor
a moment upoii the object of government in
this land.
Our Government derives its powers from the
consent of the governed. What kind of gov
ernment will the people consent to? Only
that kind of government that protects all and
which knows no favoritismâ a government in
which every citizen stands on the plaue with
out regard to position in society and without
regari to wealth. [Cheers.] A government
which knows equal rights to all and confers
special privileges on noneâ that is the kind ot
government that appeals to the affections of
the common people.
Tuere are two things to be considered in
government. The first is that in the enact
ment of legislation you should bÂ« Careful to
give no advantage to one person over another
person if that advantage can be prevented. It
is the duty of the Government to protect all if
possible, without injustice to any one. Again,
government must restrain men from injuring
one another; that is one of the important
duties of governmentâ to prevent men from
injuring one anotherâ and the government
that fails to restrain the strongest from injur
ing the weakest is a government which fails to
do its whole duty.
I was passing through lowa some months
ago and I got an idea from some hogs.
[Laughter] An idea is the most important
thing that a person can get into his head aud
we eather ideas from every source. Riding
aiong in the cars I noticed a number of hogs
â¢ rooting In a fi*ld and tearing up the ground.
The first thought that came to me was that
they were destroying a good deal of property,
and that carried me back to the time when I
lived on the farm and I remembered that we
had rings in the noses of our hogs. And why ?v
Not to keep tht> hugs from getting fat, for we
were more Interested in ttielr getting fatter
than they were. [Laughter.! The sooner
they got fat the sooner we killed them and the
longer they were In getting fat the longer ibty
lived. But why were rings put in Ihe noÂ»es of
these hogs? So that while they were getting
fat they would not destroy more property than
they were worth. And wheu I thought of that
this thought came to me â that one of the
duties of the Government, one of the important
duties of the Government, is to put rings in
the noses of hogs. Now, my friends, don't
consider this a reflection on your neighbor.
It is possible under our form of government
to have justice and to goitern aa the people
deserve. Ours is the best form of government,
but it Is possible for the people to make it so,
built on the best Intelligence, the highest
virtue and patriotism of all the people. But
let me warn you against confusing govern
ment with the abuses of government. Andrew
Jackson said that there were no necessary evils
in government; that evils existed only In its
abuses, lie was right, my friends. [Cheers.]
There are no necessary evils in government
and no man who understands the advantages
of government will raise his voice against it.
It is the abuses of government of which we have
a right to complain. There are those who
would denounce one critic seeing such abuses
and call him a disturber. A disturber is one
who breeds discontent. I want to say to you
that discontent lies at the foundation of all
progress. 'So long as you are satisfied you
never go forward, It is only when you are dis
satisfied with your conditions that you try to
improve them.
There is this difference between our form of
Government and the monarchical form. If
you are discontented under a monarchy you
can petition for relief, but your petition may
be disregarded. Discontent under a monarch
may end in despair or it may end in revolu
tion. Discontent under our form of govern
ment ends in reformation through the peace
ful means of the ballot.
I am not going to violate the proprieties of
this occasion by entering into the discussion
of partisan questions; but I desire to call your
attention to certain broad questions which
cannot be confined by party lines. The ballot
is the means by which the people of this
country must right every wrong- And if the
people have not the independence, if they
have not the intelligence to right their wrongs
at tne ballot-box they have not the courage to
secure their rights in any other way. [Cheers. J
But, my friends, conditions arose in this
country which made it impossible for the peo
ple to use the ballot which they had. Through
certain things so strong, so powerful, men
were afraid tv exercise freely and upon their
own conscience the political rights given them
under our institutions. What did they do? 1
honor the laboring man of this country and
organized labor standing at the head of the
laboring man because they secured for the
people of this country an Australian ballot.
[Great applause and cries of "You're all right,
Willie."] That ballot did not come down to
you from above ; that ballot is a result of your
own demand. It is the result of your own in
fluence. The laboring man of to-day enjoys
the advantage of the Australian ballot be
cause the laboring men of this country com
pelled the adoption of the Australian ballot.
[Cheers.]
Now, my friends, among all the agencies
winch for the past lew years have been at
work improving the condition and protecting
the rights of this country, I believe that labor
organizations stand first. They hare brought
the laboring men together where they could
compare their views, where they could unite
strength, where they could combine their in
fluences as au organization, and we have the
laboring organizations to thank for many
blessings they have secured for you. [Prolonged
applause.] Now, my frieuds, some have crit
icised labor organizations. There are some
who believe that bauks should join an associa
tion, that railroads should join associations,
that all wealthy corporations should join
associations, but not the laborlug men.
Yet the laboring man's association has
been the means by which he has
protected himself in his warfare against
these other associations. The laboring organ
ization has done as much good for society as
any of the other organizations have done or
will do. [Applause.]
I want to speak here of the principle of
arbitration of difficulties between employers
and their employes. That principle nas Deen
forced upon the attention of American people
and I believe in it. Arbitration is simply an
extension ot the idea of the court of justice.
It is an impartial institution; an impartial
tribunal before which men may come to settle
their differences instead of resorting to vio
lence to settle them. Now, my friends, when
you come to use the ballot, I want ~ou to re
member that that ballot Was not given to you
by any man who employs you. [Loud cheer
ing and cries of "We'll 'give it to you, though;
that's no dream."] That ballot was given to
you by law ; you nail it before he employed
you. It will be yours after your employment
ceases. You don't tell him that if he does not
vote according to your opinion you will quit
working for him. [Cheer* and laughter.] But
you have a right, as much right to tell him
that as he has to tell you that you will have to
quit working lor him If you don't vote as he
wantÃ you to. When I say t bis lam agt alraid
of offending anybody, because if there is an
employer in this couutrv who believes that he
has a right by paying wages to control the vote
to whom the wages go, he is a man who can
not bo offended.
I have known men who thought that because
they loaned a man money therefore as
long as they heid his note he must vote
as they wanted Him to or risk foreclosure. I
am not afraid of offending any man who has
that opinion, because a man who will use a
loan to Intimidate a citizen has not learned
the genius of the institutions uuder which we
live. I cannot Impress upon you any more im
portant truth than this: That your ballot is
your own, to do with it what you please, and
that there is nobody that must be sutistied
with your vote except your judgment and your
conscience. [Cries of "You'll be satisfied with
it, Bryan."]
At this point the limb of a tree upon
wnich a listener was sitting fell with its
human burden to the ground. Mr. Bryan
said :
At least the man who fell did not make the
mistake that some men are making; he did
not saw off ihe limb he gat on like some men
who are trying to destroy the production of
labor. [Great applause.] It is said vigilance
is the price of liberty, yes, not only for the
Nation, but for the individual. Vigilance is
the price of individual liberty. A citizen who
is indifferent is a citizeu who is apt to be mis
ruled. The citizen who is watchful has the
best chance of living underwood laws and
wise ani beneficent iustitutiom
Let me leave with you this one parting
word: Let me urge you whatever may be
your views on political questions, whatever
may be your ideas as to policy proposed from
time to time by various parties, make it your
highest ambition to prove yourself worthy of
that greatest of all names"â an American citi
zen. [Great cheering.]
BRYAN H EADED WESTWARD.
Curious Crowds Anaemble to See the
Nebraska Elocutionist.
BURLINGTON, lowa, Sept. 7. â Mr.
Bryan, who drove quickly to the Burling
ton station from Sharpshooters' Park by
way of the Auditorium Annex, leit Chi
cago by the 5:30 local train.
It was his intention to leave by the 5:50
night express, but he learned at the sta
tion that arrangements had been made to
give him a reception at Aurora, and for
that reason decided to go by the earlier
train and remain there until the 5:50 train
came in.
There were no demonstrations along the
line of Mr. Bryan's drive from Sharp
shooters' Park to the Auditorium Annex,
although he was escorted the entire dis
tance by a corps of bicyclists. The drive
from the annex to the Burlington station
wag equally without incident.
At the station Mr. Bryan became the
center of a Jarge crowd, which escorted
him to the train. Mr. Bryan was accom
panied from Chicago to Aurora by delega
tions of the Hickory Club and the Aurora
Republican Free Silver Club. S. N.
Hover, candidate for Congress on the
Democratic and Free Silver Republican
ticket, was with the Aurora contingent.
Aurora was reached at 6:30 and Mr.
Bryan, under escort of the Hickory and
ltepublican clubs' delegations, walked to
â¢ stand erected near the station, where a
large crowd was gathered. Mr. Bryan was
cheered as he ascended the stand and
made a short speech.
Although the crowd that greeted Mr.
Bryan at Earlville during the brief stop of
his train there numbered 500 only it was
very enthusiastic. Mr. Bryan spent the
time snaking hands with those who suc
ceeded in reaching the rear platform.
A brass band was playing when the
train reached Mendota and the throng
that crowded the station platform cheered
with vigor. In response to demands for a
speech Mr. Bryan said there were two
questions sometimes asked by his op
ponents: First, If we had more money
how could we get it unless we had some
thing to sell. Continuing he said :
The answer is that no matter how much
money there is you cannot get any of it unless
you have romething to sell. But every person
has something to sell, and the price will de
pend on the amount of money you have to buy
the goods. The only way to restore prosperity
is to restore the power of the people to buy
and consume what people have to sell.
Another question is how are you going to
get this money into circulation? When gold
Is taken to the mint and coined it becomes
the property of the man who brought it there,
and he uses it and it becomes part of the
money of the country. So it is with silver.
When converted into money it will be used
in buying the things which are for sale, and if
the sum of money is replenished so the supply
is sufficient to keep pace with the demand
then the level of prices is maintained. [Ap
plause.]
The crowd at Princeton was absolutely
fierce in its endeavors to shake hands
with the Democratic candidate. Men
fought wildly to reach him, s^outine all
the time. Another short speech was made
by Mr. Bryad there.
Through the fact that Mr. Bryan's car
stopped at a point saveral hundred feet
distant from where the crowd had gath
ered at Kewanee station the 2000 people
there became a howling mob as they
rushed down the tracks to reach tbe vicin
ity of the Democratic candidate.
Men, women and boys engaged in a dis
orderly race to be first on the spot. Greek
tire was burned, nnd, as it lighted up the
darkness of the night and brought into
relief the mass of humanity sprinting
from front to rear of the train, the scene
presented was widely picturesque. An
other address was made by the nominee,
which he concluded as the train drew out.
Galesbure's reception to Mr. Bryan was
exceedingly enthusiastic. The crowd was
large and had some good shouters. Mr.
Bryan was conveyed to aflatcar beside the
train, and after being Introduced by L. M.
Thompson, president of the Trades Assem
bly, he made a short speech.
Galesburg furnished the biggest crowd
that gathered to see Mr. Bryan during his
night's journey, fully 6000 people being
present It was only after a severe atrug
gle that the candidate succeeded in reach
ing the truck, and even a greater effort
was required to get back again.
Monmouth, reached at 10:45 o'clock,
was the last place where Mr. Bryan spoke
to-night. The crowd was large and
cheered without stint. It was 11:40 when
the train reached Burlington, but the
throng there was large and gave the
nominee a cordial greeting,
NECEO DEMOCRATS CALL.
Members of the National League Assure
Bryan of Support.
CHICAOG, 111., Bept. 7.â A delegation
representing the National Negro Demo
cratic League called on William J. Bryan
at the Auditorium annex this morning.
W. T. Scott, president of the league,
headed the delegation and addressing
Mr. Bryan assured him of the colored
man's support and his sympathy with a
revenue tariff and free silver. Mr. Bryan
responded briefly, remarking that it was a
healthy sign to see the negro breaking
away from his old-time relations with the
Republicans and acting independently.
Governor Altgeld spent a couple of
hours at National Democratic headquar
ters conferring with Senator Jones and
Mr. Bryan and members of the National
Committee.
A. M. Hereford, secretary of the Illinois
Democratic Editorial Association, wrote
to headquarters saying he had received
letters from all the newspaper editors of
the State, and without exception they
stated the cause of silver was in the best
condition and recruits were coming rapid
ly from the Republican ranks.
WATSON LAMPUUNT SERALL.
Declares That Him Maine Rival is a
Goldbug,
DALLAS, Tex., Sept. 7.â Hon. Thomas
E. Watson of Georgia, Populist candidate
for Vice-President, to-day addressed about
4000 persons at the State Fair grounds.
The occasion was a Labor-uay celebra
tion, but Mr. Watson seemed to have for
gotten this, as he said nothing concerning
labor, but devoted his speech to Populist
political doctrines almost exclusively.
Mr. Watson was especially severe in his
denunciation of the Democratic party, but
said practically nothing against the Re
publicans. He lampooned the Hon.
Arthur Sewall, Democratic nominee for
Vice-President, characterizing him as the
incarnation of all that is venal in politics
audj, as the prominent Republican repre
sentative of monopolies and tne money
power.
He declared that Sewall went to the
Chicago convention not only as a national
ban ker but as a gold bug at heart, and was
at that time personally supporting a gold
standard Democrat for the governorship
of Maine.
Mr. Watson declared that he was in this
lii-'ht to a finish and that he will not retire
irom the race for Vice-President in Mr.
Sewall's favor; that if Bryan is defeated
Sewall will be to blame, and that if Bryan
wins it must be because Watson wins also.
"So long as Tom Watson lives the Peo
ple's party shall not die," was one of Mr.
Watson's emphatic declarations. The
speaker reviewed the course of political
events since the Democratic party came
into National power and could discover
nothing good in the record. He lashed
the railroads for attempting to coerce em
ployes into joining sound-money clubs.
lie spoke in complimentary terms of
Mr. Bryan, saying that no railroads or
other monopoly or corporal ion had ever
controlled or can control him, and that
the same could be said of Tom Watson.
Before the imeting a parade of labor or
ganizations was held throughout the city.
Stevenson May Talk.
CHICAGO, 111., Sept. 7.â Vice-Pres
ident Stevenson arrived in the city to-day
from Mackinac, with his family. He
called at Democratic National headquar
ters and spent more than two hours in
conference with Chairman Jones. He also
conferred with Charles S. Thomas,
National C ommitteeman from Colorado.
It was officially stated that it is thought
Mr. Stevenson will make several speecues
for Bryan in Illinois and other States.
The Vice-Fresident made many inquiries
regarding the situation in Illinois, In
diana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio and the
Pacific States, and was pleased to hear
good reports from all of them. He said
he would remain in Chicago several days.
Bynum Ready for Business.
CHICAGO, 111., Sept. 7.-S. W. D. By
num, chairman of the National Demo
cratic Committee, arrived in Chicago to
night from Indianapolis and registered
at the Palmer House. The special pur
pose of his visit is to select headquarters
for the campaign committee which has
the Palmer and' Buckner ticket in charge.
He said he had been detained at Indi
anapolis, arranging for the dual notifica
tion meeting to be held in .Loui&ville next
Saturday. Headquarters will be chosen
in a day or two, and the Palmer House
will probably be the place.
DARING MARINERS WRECKED.
The Twenty- Foot Craft of the Char/sen
Brothers Is Seen Bottom Up Off
the Irish Coast.
NEW YORK, N. V., Sept. 7.â Two
more venturesome sailors have come to
grief in an effort to beat the record on a
hazardous sailing across the Atlantic.
Their boat, a twenty-foot craft with a leg
o-mutton sail aud two small jibs, was
sighted about two weeks ago rocking in
the waves, bottom up, about 350 miles off
the Irish coast, and it is simply a guees as
to what became of the two sailors who
were aboard her.
The daring sailors were Captain Frank
Charisen, formerly a mate on John Jacob
Astor's yacht, the Nourmabal, and his
brother John. They were Norwegians by
birth, but became American citizens about
a year ago. They hailed from Nyack,
whence they sailed away in the little
craft that few men would cross the
sound in.
Their boat was just 20 feet over all, with
6 feet 8 inches beum and drew 28 inches of
water. She was double-jointed and sup
plied with an air-chamber at each end,
supposed to make her unsinkable. She
had a heavy lead keel to keep her right
side up in any kind of weather, and for
propelling power she had two pairs of oars
and carried a small mainsail, jib and fly
ing-jib.
The Charlsens left this port in their lit
tle craft Sunday, June 21, announcing
that they would make Queenstown as the
first port, and that then tbe course would
be tne Isle of Wight, Southampton.
London, Hamburg, Bremen, Copenhagen,
Stockholm, Bergen, Hull, Leith, by canal
to Edinburgh, tben Glasgow, Newport in
Wales, Cork. Belfast, Londonderry and
back to New York, where they expected to
arrive and be greeted as heroes* in the
summer of 1897.
EAST RIVER WALL COLLAPSES.
Caves In With a Crash That Startles
People for Blocks Around and
Causes a Panic.
NEW YORK, N. V., Sept. 7.â The un
dermining of the rear wall at the East
River end of Fifty-second street caused
about twenty feet of the street and about
1000 cubic feet of the wall to cave in and
to topple over into the river, with a crash
that startled the neighborhood for several
blocks around, last evening at 7:15 o'clock.
At the vary edge of the enormous pit made
by the cave-in stands the towering wall oi
a cigarette factory.
The roar of the landslide brought hun
dreds of peopie to the scene, and it was
with great difficulty that the police kept
the crowd from blindly rushing in upon
dangerous ground to view the wreckage.
Excitement was intensified by the rumor
that some persons were buried beneath
the mass of earth and stone. In the crowd
were over 100 girls who work in the cigar
ette factory and had rushed to the scene,
believing that the factory building bad
fallen down.
STbe wall which broke away was about
50 feet from the river brink to the level of
the street. Its entire face, with the ex
ception of a narrow strip near the south
sidewalk was washed away, and what did
not slip into tbe river was piled in a con
fused mass at the river edge.
Tons of earth and cobblestones fell upon
a boathouse and two skiffs belonging to a
boatman, crushing them like eggshells.
The cave-in on the north side of the street
extended clear up to the walls of the
cigarette factory and almost its entire
length. Nothing but the stout walls and
massive masonry of the foundation saved
An investigation showed that the rains
of yesterday and the day before had
soaked and bulged out thÂ« old wall, which
had been insecure for several years Sev
eral persons had just stepped away from
the seawall and were but 200 feet away
when the crash came.

in the Single-Scull
Race.
ENDS IN A PROCESSION.
The World's Championship and a
Stake of $2500 Captured
by the Canadian.
STANBTJRY'S SPEEDY SPURTS'
Takes the Lead at One Stage, but
Lacks the Staying Qualities of
His Opponent.
LONDON. Esq., Sept. 7.â The single
acull race for the world's championship
and a stake of Â£500 between Jacob
Gaudaur, the Canadian oarsman, and
James St anbury of Victoria, Australia,
who -won tbe championship by defeating
Charles R. ("Wag") Harding of Putney
on July 13 last, was rowed to-day and re
sulted in a victory for the Canadian, who
won with the greatest ease.
The race was rowed over the old
champion course of four miles and 300 !
yards, from Putney to Mortlake, and was
witnessed by large crowds of people, who
lined the river banks.
The start was made at 1:45 p. H. Gaudaur
was fi>st to catch the water, and soon had
a good lead, which he gradually increased
until passing Hammersmith bridge, when
he was nearly teu lengths ahead and quite
that distance in the lead at the finish.
Gaudaur was the first to get away, bnt
600 yards from the start Stanbury, who
was palling steadily, crept up and grad
ually passed Gaudaur, leading the Cana
dian by a quarter of a length at Clasper's
boat yards. When Stanbury passed Gau
daur the crowds along the river bank be
came greatly excited and cheered them
selves hoarse. Gaudaur rowed desperately
and stuck to his opponent closely. Both
men at this stage of the race were pulling
gradually.
At Beverly Brook Gaudaur had pulled
away from his opponent, so that he led by
a quarter of a length, and was the same ;
distance in the lead at the Cravensteps. j
Both men had by this time dropped their |
stroke to 30 to the minute, but Gaudaur .
was rowing with more power in his strokes
and was a clear length in advance at Crab
tree.
Continuing to row very fast, the Cana
dian increased his lead and got away from
the Australian so rapidly that at Harrod'a
wharf he led by a length and a half.
At this point Gaudaur took Stanbury's i
water, whereupon the Australian spurted |
vigorously, obviously trying for a foul.
This move caused Gaudaur to go back to
iiis own side, loosing somewhat thereby,
for when he reached his own water he was
leading by rather less than a length, j
When they shot by Hammersmith bridge, j
which they reached . in 8 minutes and 50 j
seconus, Gaudaur again went over toward
Stanbury's water and the Australian re
peated his attempt to foul his opponent, i
thi9 time with more success than before.
Stanbury put on a furious spurt and man
aged to foul the Canadian just off the
leadmills, but after this he was never in
the race.
Seeming to be satisfied that he was
beaten, he held up from the moment he
fouled his opponent and did not appear at
any time thereafter to exert himself much.
Gaudaur kept on with his powerful
strokes, going away from Stanbury easily
and increasing his lead every moment.
Indeed, from the leadmills to the finish it
was a procession, Gaudaur reaching the
winning-post about 200 yards ahead of the
Australian champion. Gaudaur's time
was 23:01 and Stanbury's 23:46.
Upon crossing the finish line Stanbury
protested against Gaudaur being awarded
the race, alleging that the latter had
fouled. His claim was not allowed.

WONDERFUL WETKEN.
Sets the World's Record for 300 lards
at 31 Seconds.
BERGEN POINT. N. J., Sept. 7.â The
feature of the Labor day games of the
New Jersey Athletic Club was the break
ing of the world's record for 300 yards by
Bernard J. Wafers, toe Georgetown Col
leee and New York Athletic Club crack,
who ran the distance in 31 seconds.
Wefers held the previous record of 31 1-5
seconds, which he made at the New York
Athletic Club fall games at Travers Island
last year. In order that he might have
an opportunity oi doing better time a spe
cial invitation scratch race for 300 yards
was put on the proÃramme. The starters
were Wefers, "Hen" Lyons and F. P.
Garvan of the New York Athletic Club
and Frank W. Jaryis of Pittsburg. We
fers left his mark like a flash and quickly
led the field. Coming down the back
stretch he was six yards ahead of Lyons
and Garvan. Jarvis kicked himself and
retired. Wefers put on a tremendous
amount of speed up the stretch and
breasted the tape twelve yards in front of
Lyons. Two of the timekeepers clocked
31 seconds, while a third made the time
30 4-5 seconds. The majority of the
judges, of course, decided the time, which
agreed with two or three outside watches.
About 3500 people witnessed tbe games.
The track was in good condition. The
rest of the sport was only average.

BRESLAU FETES THE CZAR

Dine Together and Visit
a Theater.
Yon Hobenlohe Has a Pleasant Con
ference With Nicholas on the
Eastern Question.
BRESLAU, Germany, Sept. 7.â The fes
tivities in connection with the visit of the
Czar and Czarina were continued yesterday
but it being Sunday the popular enthusi
asm was not as demonstrative as it was
yesterday.
Emperor William and Empress Augusta
Victoria attended a luncheon given Sunday
by their Imperial Majesties of Russia.
Twenty covers were laid. The lunch
eon was given in the grand reception-room
of the new house of the. Silesia Landtag.
After the luncheon the Czar and Chancel
lor yon Hohenlohe were closeted together
for an hour. It is not positively known
what matters were discussed, but there is
strong belief that the action to De taken
by Russia and Germany in connection
with the Turkish question was considered
at length.
In the evening a gala performance was
given at the Stadt Theater. Tne play
given. was the second part of the "Militaer
Fromm," and it was very amusing. Em
peror William shook with laughter and
even the Czar smiled at the absurdities of
some of the positions.
This evening a reporter of the United
Associated Presses had a conversation
with one of Chancellor yon Hohenlohe's
aids, who said the Chancellor was ex
ceedingly well pleased with the result of
his audience with the Czar. He added
that an absolute entente cordiale had been
effected, and that this would soon; bÂ»>
shown by the action that will be taken by
Russia and Germany on the Eastern ques
tion. As further evidence of the good un
derstanding that has been established be
tween the Czar and Emperor William it is
stated that the former , has promised that
when he returns from Darmstadt he will
visit Emperor William at Potsdam. â¢
BERLIN, Germany, Sept. 7.â The Czar
and Czarina, Emperor and Empress ar
rived at Goerlitz before noon. The Czar
wore the uniform of the Nicholas II Hus
sars and the Kaiser was attired in the uni
form of the Cuirassiers. Their Majesties
drove directly from the , station to
the parade ground. Though the ground
was in very bad condition in con
sequence of . the heavy rains of
yesterday and the sky overcast, the pro
gramme was carried out, but the move
ments; of the troops were necessarily un
satisfactory. The Czar and the Kaiser
rode back to the city at the head of the
color companies and the Czarina and Em
press were driven back. in a carriage. The
two Imperial couples took dinner together
it the Standehaus, no others being present
except the members of their respective
:ourts. B^B^B^B^B^B^B^B^B^B^B^B^B^B^B^BH

The city was liehted again to-night to
see now the electrical decorations worked.
One of the most beautiful streets is El
Dorado, where the greater number of
handsome residences are. The owners
have spared neither time nor means to
beautify them, and there was never a
street in any western city that presented
such an attractive appearance as did El
Dorado to-night.
Nearly all the fine residences are hand
somely decorated. One in particular has
hundreds of multi-colored electric lights
in the big evergreen trees about it, and
tne effect is strikingly beautiful.

1 and appointed aoout thirty special officers
to look out for the crowd that will be here
j day after to-morrow.

YOLO BANDITS AT LARGE
Outlaw Morgan's Confederates
Elude the Searcn of
Officers.
Conflicting Stories Concerning the
Antecedents of the Dead
Robber.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., SeDt. 7.â No trace
of the two confederates of Outlaw Morgan
has been found. Although good descrip
tions of the pair have been obtained and
an exhaustive search conducted they
have so far eluded the police in the city
and the posses that have not been idle in
the country.
The outlaw killed by Engineer Ingles
aboard the cab of his engine has had a
varied experience and lived In many
places at one time, if the stones of some
of those who gazed upon his features to
day can be believed.
One person positively identified him as
F. J. Morgan of Grand Island, Nebr., and
stated that he was one of a family of eight
children and the traditional black sheep.
He has been identified by a resident of
Woodland as his boon companion of
years â a man whom he slept with, ate
with and labored with day after
day; a companion so close that
time after time he confided to the
Woodland man his intention to follow in
the footsteps of Bandit Brady and rob this
identical train, but had been turned from
his expressed indentions by the entreaties
of this gentleman. He has been identified
as one of a family of three brot :ers, who
resided in Stanislaus County :ind who was
wanted for tbe robbery of the Milton train.
Soon ad infinitum and in every case the
identification has been positive.
The most plausible theory is that Mor
gan was the leading member of a band of
three that made a regular business of rob
bery in outside towns, making their head
quarters in San Francisco. Taking ad
vantage of the influx of visitors to the
State t'air'to escape observation they came
to this city and located Â«t a downtown
hotel, making a quiet saloon near the
water front their headquarters.
After robbing the powder magazine of
Shaw, Ingram & Batcher of the dynamite
with which they intended to force an en
trance iuto the express-car, they surveyed
the railroad between this city and Davis
ville and formulated their plans.
it is supposed that the dead man was a
railroad hreman at one time and so chose
tbe honor of boarding the train at Davis
ville, capturing the engineer and lireman
and forcing them to go to the spot se
lected for the robbery.

ASTORIA. Or., SeDt. 7.â Frank and
Enos Walker of Olympia, their cousin,
Henry Walker, a rancher living near Oak
Point, and Eben Hoffman of Astoria bad
a scrimmage with two large cinnamon
bears while hunting last Friday that they
are not likely to forget during the rest of
their lives. For miles back of Oak Point
the country is densely timbered,
with a somewhat heavy undergrowth.
That section abounds in deer and deer
were what the four sportsmen were look
ing for. In the forenoon they had been
fortunate enough to bring a buck to grass.
After continuing the hunt for a couple of
hours Henry Walker remarked that some
one better look after tbe slain animal.
Enos Walker and Hoffman volunteered to
bring it in.
When tney arrived at the spot where
the buck had been slain they found that
the carcass had disappeared. They insti
tuted a search in the underbrush and not
far distant from the natural clearing
where they left it they soon found their
venison in the possession of two cinnamon
cubs, which were 'easting upon It. Enos
Walker killed one of the cubs with a rifle
ball. No sooner had the echo of the shot
reverberated than two huge cinnamon
bears rushed upon the men. Hoffman,
who^e back was turned to the brutes, was
knocked down with one stroke of a paw,
which landed on his right side and frac
tured four of his ribs. Strangely enough,
the brute turned from the prostrate man,
who was rendered unconscious from the
shock, and both bears centered their at
tention upon Enos Walker.
Then began a struggle for life. Walker
was armed with a magazine rifle, and this
he fired as rapidly as he could. Each bear
was wounded in several places, but not
fatally. The magazine was fast being
emptied, and Walker be^an to retreat
backward, firing when the bears got too
close. This was no easy task, as his path
way was obstructed by the undergrowth
and the tall timber.
Walker's rapid firing attracted the at
tention of his brother and his cousin, who
were not a great way off. They reached
Enos not a moment too soon. The bears
had ignored unconscious Hoffman, stead
ily advancing upon Enos. A< the instant
that Frank and Henry hove into sight the
female bear had caueht up with Enos,
who had fired the last charge in his rifle,
and rising upon her haunches, she threw
her full weight upon him. He fell, and
the brute, weak from loss of blood, went
down with him. A second later she was
on the fallen man, chewing away at the
clolhing covering his right shoulder.
While Frank was keeping the male bear
at bay, Henry sent two rifle balls through
tbe head of the brute covering his cousin,
just in time to save his life. Enos had
suffered a broken collar bone and the loss
of the tip of his nose, which greatly dis
figures him.
Fiank Miller was not less unfortunate.
The bear with which he was lighiing
knocked him down with a powerful blow,
which broke his left arm and crusbed the
left side of his face. At this stage of the
encounter bruin was frightened away by
two voliey3 from Henry's rifle, anri he was
lost sight of in the brush. The hunters
were glad of it. They had had a surfeit of
bear hunting for one day.

Phillips, an Erstwhile
Friend.
Shoots His Victim Twice, Despite Pleat
for Mercy â Crime Caused
by Liquor.
COLUSA, Cal.. Sept. 7.â At Arbnckle
yesterday afternoon J. Price Vaughn shot
and killed A. M. Phillips. Both men
were .well known in the community and
each had many friends. There was only
one witness to the affair, A. B. Jackson, a
grain buyer for a San Francisco firm.
The shooting occurred at an opening in
a fence rear a tankhouse in the yard back
of the office occupied by Jackson. Phil
lips was just outside the yard in an alley
way opposite the opening or gateway busy
unloading a camping outfit, which had
been used by Vaughn, Creighton Howeil
and himself, the four having just returned
from a camping trip in the mountains.
There was some dispute about the division
of the things in the wagon. Vaughn dre w
his pistol and fired at Phillips through
t he opening in the fence at a distance of
about twelve feet. Phillips had some
cooking utensils and articles of tinware in
his arms.
ihe first shot did not take effect, and
Vaughn advanced toward Phillips, who
tv rned to avoid him and held up his right
hand, exclaiming:
'â¢My God. Price, don't, don't 1"
Vaughn fired the second shot, which
struck Phillips' left arm near the elbow,
entered the body and pierced the lunÂ£,
producing a fatal wound. Vaughn still
advanced as Phillips was retreating and
fired again. This ball entered Phillips'
back at the lower end of tbe shoulder
blade, passed the right other lung and
into the liver. Phillips then walked or
ran down the alley to" the street and fell
on the sidewalk at the corner of the Din
widdie House, expiring in a few seconds.
Vaughn had been drinking, but Phillipa
was sober. As far as can be learned the
men had been warm friends previous to
this trouble. A Coroner's jury returned a
verdict charging Vauphn with willful
murder. He was arrested and is now con
fined in the County Jail.

PORTLAND, Or., Bept. 7.â On June 26
the decomposed body of a man was found
floating in the Willamette River near this
I city. An inquest was held; nobody was
' able to identify the deceased and the re
| mains were intered in the pauper*' field.
A few pencil notes in a memorandum
book established the fact that he was a

and reported the circumstances to the Im
perial Government.
The Consul has just received a letter an
nouncing that the unknown dead was a
brother of the Corpeilos, the great bankers

BILLS OWING
BY THE STATE
Examiners Investigate a
Varied Collection of
Claims.
UNION DEPOT FUNDS
No Action to Be Taken Until
All Contracts Are Filed
at the Capitol.
BRAVE OFFICERS REWARDED.
Will B) Recompensed for Removing
Desperadoes â The Coyote
Scalp Inquiry.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Sept. 7. â The
State Board of Examiners met to-day pur
suant to-law to investigate the merits of
all claims against the State for which
there was no existing appropriation.
Such as in its judgment possessed-merit
were recommended to the attention of the
coming session of the Legislature, while
others were rejected in tota.
The first subject called to the attention
of the board was the matters ot claims for
the erection of the Union depot in San
Francisco, and it was agreed that the
Board of Harbor Commissioners should be
notified that until all awarded contracts
had been tiled with the Board of Exam
iners no claims would be allowed.
The complaints against the YountviHe
Veterans' Home were referred to Secre
tary of State Brown for investigation.
The subject of employes of the Legis
lature cropped up. Secretary of State
Brown said the Legislature took the con
trol of the capitol out of bis hands. Il
even laid off his elevator man and em
ployed one of its own. It had engaged
six porters in addition to his full force,
and he would jump at the chance to con
tract to run the building for one-quarter
what it cost during the former Bession.
The matter of contingtnt expenses was
gone into, and it was found that in 1880,
for a 100-day session, the amount expended
was $16,000; in 1881, $19,000, while the
later sessions hal run the amount up to
from $45,000 to $60,000.
The Secretary of State desired to be in
formed as to how the State reports could
be limited, as in the past thousands of
books had been printed and never used.
It was decided to refer the matter for an
opinion to the Attorney-General, and Si
[retary Markley was instructed to get a list
of the number of volumes of reports pub
lished each year for the past five years,
and if possible ascertain how many were
used.
The claim of the estate of A. J. Bogard, |
who killed Bandit Browning and was in i
turn k lied by "Jack" Brady in the Wheat- j
land hold-up, was recommended, as was
also the claim of Earl Daggett, who killed
Dan McCall at the hold-up at Goshen, and
W. N. ilend ricks, who killed John Keener
while he was attempting to rob a stage
coach at Foils station, Calaveras County.
Each of these claims was for $300. They
will have to go before the Legislature.
All the military claims for the 1894
strike period were recommended.
The coyote-scalp investigation was post
poned for two weeks, at which time a
number of witnesses will be subpenaed i
and sworn and efforts made to arrive at !
the bottom of the fraudulent claims, as j
charged by the Kern County Grand Jury.
The old-time claim of Jose Ramon Picos I.
for organizing the First California Na
lional Cavalry during tlie war came up.
The claim was for $8111 15. It was re
ferred to Secretary Brown, who will look
into the facts of tbe case.
Prison Director Robert Devlin, on tho
part of the commission, requested to be
allowed a monthly deficiency for San
Quentin for three months, until the
supar-bag appropriation became available.
The Attorney-General favored the propo
sition and the matter will probably re
ceive favorable consideration.
The subject of the salary of R. I. I
Thomas, commonly dubbed â¢â¢Dick," sec
retary of the Dobris Commission, in the
sum of $250, provoked a spirited argu
ment, Devlin contending that it was not
the purpose of the Legislature to give
debris people any salary until a con
tingency arose.
"Is the act used for promoting private
interest* or for protecting public water
ways?" Inquired Fitzgerald.
"Both may betaken intoconsideration,"
replied Devlin. "These dams do the val
ley people no good, and if they fail they
create a great deal of danger."
The board decided that Thomas was en
titled to his salary since the passage of
tbe United States appropriation.
The expenses of the funeral of Lieuten
ant-Governor Millard and General Di
mond received recommendations, and the
claim of Dennis Jordan for building the
Folsom State Prison was taken up. Fitz
gerald said:
"This claim was passed upon by the
board. 1 see no use in considering it
again. I don't know that we have a right
to cut down the claim, thus rescinding tho
action of the former board. The claim
was allowed for $79,000 by the Legislature.
Governor Budd vetoed it because it was
too much. 1 decline to consider the mat
ter, because it has been adjudicated."
Attorney Spelling said that Jor.ian had
fought the claims through five Legisla
tures. The claim has been passed upon
favorably by each, but there was some
flaw in each case to defeat it. Tbe Dill
never has been vetoed, but always pock
eted.
In view of the fact that the Legislature
had passed bills for as high as $79,000 the
board should give at least $63,000, the
amount computed by Secretary Markley.
Jordan was a man of moderate fortune
and lost every cent he had in the venture.
Jordan claimed that animosity on the i
part of certain architects had ruined him. j
Among the requisitions served on him was j
one for 1,000,000 bricks when there were
not 10,000 bricks used in the whole build
ing.
Fitzeerald said he was not informed on
both sides of the question and was not in
a position to act. Budd and Brown de
cided they would recommend the appro
priation for $63,000.
Secretary Brown asked for a deficiency
of $5000 for repairs and improvements to
the Capitol building, to consist of furniture
for some of the offices. It was allowed.
Joseph Steffens appeared asking for per
mission to build a house for the resident
physician at Stockton, to cost $7000.
Brown and Budd refused to give a de
cision and said they would consider the
matter a week from to-day. Both were
opposed to tbe scheme. The board of
trustees had already let the contract.
Budd, upon hearing it, asked Steffens if
he wanted to pay for the building him
self. As a result Steffens appeared before 1
the board for the necessary permit.
Santa Crux's Bond Litigation.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Sept. 7.â There
was filed to-day in the United States Cir
cuit Court the answer of the city of Santa
Cruz in the case of the refunding water
bond suit. The amount sued for is nearly
$360,000. The city's attorneys have tiled
six separate defenses, the answer being
most exhaustive. Tne main point is that
no special notice of the election authoriz
ing the issuance of the bonds was pub
lished, although the ordinance for the
election was printed.
DISASTER NEAR TULARE.
Thomas Salter's Mistake in Discharging a
Gun Near Giant Powder Causes
His Death.
TULARE, Cal., Sept. 7. â Thomas
Salter. an Enelishman 40 years of age. was
instantly killed last night on the Stanage
ranch, fourteen miles southeast of Tul&re.
The ranch is the property of the'Farm
ers'Union Milling Company and was in
charge of John F. Alien. Allen, who is a
miner as well as rancher, had seventy-five
pounds of giant powder stored in the
cellar. Allen had gone to the White
River mines, leaving Salter in charge of
the ranch. Ke returned last night at 9
o'clock and found his ho.ise, a commo
dious six-room cottage, almost completely
wrecked. Turning to the cellar, a dug
out twenty feet from the house, he stum
bled over the body of Salter. The cellar
and contents were demolisued and wreck
age was strewn about in all directions.
Salter had declared to neighbors that he
was "going to kill that skunk that was
making trouble for tue old hen that was
sitting in the cellar near the boxes of
giant powdpr." It is the accepted theory
that he took his gun and either went into
the cellar or uj>on the steps and. fired at
the skunk, the concussion causing the ex
plosion. The gun, a muzzle-loader, was
found to-day with the stocÂ£ broken off
and but one barrel loaded.
PASSED AWAY AT BELLEVUE.
Death of Nelson Wescoatt, Mining Expert,
Law - Maker and Philan
thropist.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Sept. 7.â Nelson
Wescoatt, the well-known mining expert,
died this morning at the residence of fiis
son, John Wescoatt, near Bellevue.
Wescoatt was a native of Ohio, aged 75
years, and came to this State in 1853. In
1862 he went to Virginia City, where he
made and lost several fortunes. He was
at one time a State Senator in Nevada, and
was the author of some of the mining
laws now on the statute-books of that
State. He was considered an authority
on mining topics, and bis advice was
often sought by the most prominent min
ing men of the West. Of a warm-hearted
and generous nature, he assisted his
friends whenever asked, and he gave away
more money than it falls to the lot of the
average man to possess in a lifetime. He
possessed valuable mining property in
Candelaria, Nev., at the time of his death.
He leaves surviving three brothers and a
son.
SAN RAFAEL INNOVATION,
The Paper Chase to Give Way
to a Hunt for a R?al
Kangaroo.
From Australia Was Imported the
Quarry That Society Will
Pursue.
SAN RAFAEL, Cal., Sept 7.â England
has her fox hunts, Southern California
her coyote hunts, and San Rafael hitherto
her paper chases, but hereafter she will
lead the world with nothing more or less
than a kangaroo hunt. A young kangaroo
has been secured by the Hotel Rafael man
agement from Australia. This will be ex
hibited in a few days at the California
Hotel, in San Francisco, and later will be
placed in a small corral pending the excit
ing events to transpire on its liberation.
All of the experienced riders who have
participated in the paper chases will take
stations near the Hotel Rafael, the kan
garoo will be turned loose and will be pur
sued across country until recaptured. A
pack of twenty-five English bounds is be
ing trained for the hunt, which will occur
some time during the latter part of
September.
The kangaroo is noted for its fleetness
and its high jumping. The chances are
that there will be but few riders in at the
brush. The fact that kangaroos are not a
drug on tae market will make tbe windup
a difficult affair, as care must be taken not
to harm the animal. It has been sug
gested that each rider be equipped with a
lariat, and It is stated that many have al
ready acted on this suggestion and have
provided themselves with tbe light yet
exceedingly strong hair woven ropes.
The same rules gov^rninu the fox hunts
in England will obtain, and the first lady
in at the "brush" will receive â not the
brush, because kangaroos unfortunately
do not possess snch an ornament â some
suitable prize as a souvenir of her skill.
MOURNING AT STANFORD.
News of the Death of Adam H. Jack Sadly
Received by the University
Students.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Sept.
7. â Stanford students, and Stanford ath
letes especially, are shocked to learn that
the Adam A. Jack, who fell dead on a
street in San Francisco lately, was the
promising mile walker of this university.
Jack entered Stanford with tbe class of
'99 and took up the study of physiology as
his major, in pursuance of his intention
to become a physician. He had received
a thorough preparatory training in a pri
vate school of Truro, Nova Scotia, of which
city he was â  resident before matriculat
ing here. He was a conscientious worker
with his studies and a favorite with his
professors and classmates.
When the athletic enthusiasm wa3 on
last spring Jack wont into regular train
ing with a vigor seldom seen in a first-year
man. He tried for the mile walk and de
veloped both speed and endurance. So
great was the faith of the Stanford track
captain in his ability that he was made a
member of the Varsity trcck team, and it
was confidently predicted that Mervin
alone of the Berkeley representatives in
his event would beat him. Such proved to
be the case in tbe intercollegiate match
when Mervin had hard work to beat him.
The Berkeley walker complimented JacK
very highJy and Coffin, the great coaÂ«t
walker and athletic authority at that time,
said Jack was destined to become one of
the fastest men in the country. He was
but 23 years old at his deatli and a very
large, strongly built fellow. The class of
'99 wili adopt'rasolutions of regret.

LENA N WINS
AT SACRAMENTO
Northrup's Mare Proves the
Best Novice of the
Season.
HER GAIT IS PERFECT.
Without Eflbrt She Steps Off the
First Heat in a Pacing
Race in 2:13
AUDITOR TAKES A PUKSE.
Blue Bel's Enriches Her Backers by
Securing a Place at Long
Odds.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Sept. 7âWhile
the programme at the track to-day did
not call out any of the top-notchers of the
light-harness brigade, the large crowd in
attendance saw some splendid sport, in
cluding several close and exciting finishes.
In the 2:27 pace the best "green one" of
the year was uncovered. Lena N, a strap
ping big daughter of Sidney (2:19^), un
incumbered by hobbles or other racing
paraphernalia, with a Â»;ait that was sim
ply perfection, stepped off the first heat in
2:13 with no apparent effortâ a wonderful
performance. The mare, which is owned
by C. F. Northrup, a prominent merchant
of Petaluma, is by Sydney from Helen
Ben ton, by General Beaton. Her gran
dam, Nettie George, said to be the dam of
Arab (2:15), was a thoroughbred racer
years ago by Wesley George, as were all
of her maternal ancestors back to the
fourteenth dam. Wilfred Page purchased
the pacer from her breeder, Josiah White
of Lakeviile, for $380, and in turn sold
her to Mr. Nortbrup for the sum of $80.
Her present owner offered her for sale for
$400 previous to the first heat, and it is
rumored that she will shortly become a
member of Winship & Heating's string.
Outside of this brilliant performance
the racing was marked by nothing of the
sensational order. A cooling breeze sprang
up during the day and was hailed with I
delight by all. Five books in the big ring
and two field books enjoyed liberal pat
ronage.
Auditor captured the 2:30 trot in straight
: heats, making a mark of 2:19},, and Ellert,
a handsome bay gelding, by Stamboul,
and owned by Millionaire Alvinza Hay
ward, won two of the dashes in the 2:35
trot and took a record of 2:19. About the i
best thing of the day was Blue Bells, which
finished second in one, heat to Lena N.
with odds of 20 to 1 about her for the place
and quietly played by a few knowing ones.
Eight responded to the tap of the bell
for the 2:30 trot. In the pools the field,
consisting of Peter Jackson, Millie L,
Billups, Leader, Goldy and Silver Ring,
sold for $10. with Auditor bringing $3 and
Fannie 0 $3." Goldy and Fannie C were
leading the others at the half, with Au
ditor back in the rear. Goldy broke
; shortly after, and Peter Jackson was the '<
first into the homestretch. Coming on
from fourth position, Auditor gamely
strode to the front and took the heat by
nearly two lengths from Fanny C in 2 :20%.
There was no material change In the bet- I
ting before the second heat. It proved
easy came for Auditor, who won it and
the beat following off the reel. Fanny C
was second and I'eter Jackson third in
each of the miles trotted.
There were six starters in the 2:35 trot,
decided under the new system of heat
dashes, each neat being considered a race.
Wow, driven by Ed Lafferty, the popular
La Siesta farm reinsman, was backed down
by her party from 2's to 3to 5 favoritism
to pull off the first heat. Casey, behind
Ellert. managed to get the pole from Cap
tain Harris turning down the back stretch,
being shortly joined by Wow. The pair
had a hot duel to the wire, but the Stam- j
boul horse possessed the most speed and
headed Wow out three lengths, in 2:19.
Ellert, now a hot 3 to 5 chance, took the
second heat easily, although Alia, driven
by James Dustin. came with a big rush at
the end, on the strength- of which she was
; well played to down Ellert in the heat fol
lowing. This she did. A break after pass
ing the half pole in the third heat cost El
len a length or so, but he caught quickly
and hit the stretch for home on equal
terms with Alia. In a hard-fought contest
to the stand, Dustin managed to nip the j
heat at the tape by a neck with the Palo |
Alto stock farm mare. According to the
rules, there being but two horses eligible
to start in the fourth beat, which requires '
three or more, that heat was declared off,
and the society was ahead just $200.
There certainly was no immediate
danger of any of the pencilers having a
"Dutch" on the last event, the 2:27 pace,
also heat dashes, for the odds were boiled
down to the marrow. Bastina and Mnllie
Nurse held first honors in the betting,
each being quoted at twos. Lena N, driven
by P. Hoi brook, wiggled around in 2:13
with 3 to 1 against her, and the other
drivers knew they had struck a snag. She
also waltzed off the other two heats in
pleasing fashion in 2:16^ and 2:20 and
under the rules was not allowed to com
pete in the fourth, or consolation heat.
Andy McDowell mode his first appear
ance at the meeting behind Blue Bells.
The consolation heat was the hottest
contested affair of the day. A furlong
from the wire the five starters were on
nearly equal terms, all driving furiously.
Butcher Boy, driven by Dan Misner. had
the most speed and passed the finishing j
post a length before Bastinn. In the third
heat Clark, behind Mollie Nurse, did some
bad piloting at the first turn, colliding
with Butcher Boy's bike. - Misner, driver
of the latter horse, lodged a protest with
the judges and Mollie was ruled out.

SPIRITUALISTS' REUNION
Final Meeting of the State As
sociation in Golden Gate
Hall.
What It Is Claimed That Organiza
tion Has Done for the Order.
A Funeral.
The State Spiritualists' Association met
in Golden Gate Hall Sunday morning
in informal session. A large audience
was present. President Thomas G. New
man presided, and on the platform were
Rev. H. P. Haworth, Mrs. Hen dee-Ropers,
Hattie D. Wrenn, Mrs. F. A. Logan, Mrs.
Maxwell-Colby, Mrs. Fannie Place and
Mrs. G. W. Shriner. v
The exercises began with a fine violin
solo by Professor R. D. Young, accom
panied by Mme. E. Young, which was fol
lowed by a poetic invocation by Mrs. Hen
dee-Rogers.
State President Newman introduced
Hon. Harrison D. Barrett, of Washington,
D. C, president of the National Associa
tion of spiritualists. He said that formerly
there had seemed to be no place in the
world for Spiritualism, but that now, since
organization, all that was changed and
spiritualism has a place and an influence
in the world â a recognized factor in the
preat moral work of civilization. He held
that the God of Spiritualism was that all
pervading power which creates, evolves
and moves all things.
â¢ Th. mas G. Newman followed and
likened spiritualism in California and the
Nation, previous to organization, to Sher
idan's army, and President 'Barrett's trip
through the States to Sheridan's famous
ride, the result in both cases being the
same â confusion and disorder were
changed to order and system.
Rev. H. P. Haworth's address was full
of good points and evoked considerable
enthusiasm among his listeners.
At the afternoon session Mrs. Chandler
led the audience in singing "Nearer My 1
God to Thee," after which N. F. Ravlin j
spoke on "The Evolution of Esoteric
Spiritualism," and said that by exoteric
systems one might turn out all sorts of
thinkers, professors, etc., without once
touching: the spiritual nature. He, was
vehement in his defense of woman.
Mrs. Emma Sherwood of Chicago sang
"The Poor Man's Sheaf."
Professor W. J. Colville, a speaker well
known to San Francisco spiritualists,
spoke upon the same subject as did Mr.
Ravlin. : . â¢ .
A violin solo was then given by Pro
fessor E. A. Whitelaw of Boston, accom
panied by Mrs. Geraldme Morris.
' The evening session of the association
was attended* by a crowd that filled Golden
Gate Hall. The meeting was opened by !
the playing of the President Barrett !
march by Young's Orchestra. Mr. Bar
rett recited "The Song of the Mystic," by
Father Ryan, the poet priest of the South,
and proceeded with his address.
"Spiritualism," he said, "comes with a
message of iove and an outstretched hand
to all classes, from the lowest pariah of
society to the highest in the land â shuns
none, but is ready to help all up to a
higher manhood or ; womanhoodâ ready
to help all who have lost the raiment of j
pnrity to win new garments and the crown
of duty well performed." .
An address was given by Mrs. Eliza
beth Watson, who for a long time prior to
1889 was lecturer for the Progressive Spir
itualists' Society. Mis. Watson's address
was short but full of poetic feeling, and
was frequently interrupted with applause.
After some pleasing musical, numbers
had been given Edward K. Earle, the test
medium, gave a series .tests. At the
close of Mr. Earle's tests the meeting ad
journed. â  .__
Funeral of 31. B. Dodge.
The funeral services of M. B. Dodge
were held by the United Spiritualist So
cieties of the City Suuday afternoon at
Golden Gate Hall. The exercises began
by a vocal solo, "Angels, Ever Bright and
Fair," rendered by Mrs. G.R. Tuttle.
Mrs. ' Elizabeth Lowe " Watson then
offered an invocation and j spoke of
the life of the deceased as a part of that
better life toward' which the world is
moving. She spoke of him asoue who in
spirit would ever be present to counsel
and advise in deeper, greater love than
earth can have.
Mrs. G. R. Tuttle and Mrs. Frances-
Rogers then sang the duet, "The Old
Man's Dream," a favorite of the late Mr.
Dodge.. . ,'â 
Professor J. J. Morse of England, de
livered the funeral oration.
The pall bearers were William M. Rider,
resident of the Progressive Spiritualists
Society; W. H. Yeaw, vice-president- F.
B. Small, J. H. Moore, John Koch, L. A
ugh lu A D. Hall and George H. awes!
The coffin was beautifully decorated with
flowers and sheaves of ripened grain The
interment was in Odd Fellows' Cemetery.

Three Thousand Voungater* Madly
struggle for Admission to the Circus.
Last night was newsboys' night at the
circus, and every enterprising youngster
in town put in an appearance,' with t:,e
hope of being carried in with the 350 that
the company had contracted to admit
free. The result was a jam of nearly 3000
small boys at the Market-street entrance
to Central Park, and some of them must
have been slightiy hurt.
Tue horde became so threatening in size
that the management found it necessary
to close the doors and clear the approach
after admitting about 400. Then did a
strange, medleyed howi go up from the
future voters that had been disappointed
in a (treat juvenile expectation, and the
wild beasts inside the tented city did pace
their cages in awful apprehension ; but
their fears were not realized. Youne
America lingered only a little while near
tbe scene of his discomfiture, then he went
away, vowing vengeance in the days when
he shall have a say in fixing the munici
pal tax on circuses.
Next Friday afternoon the management
will admit free the poor children of tba
Pixley Kindergarten.

The report omitted to state tbat poor
Patton of the Sixth District, the most
ruthless sacrifice of the deal, had ap
peared aad withdrawn, and Patton's
friend, John W. Mitchell, called attention
to it, whereupon Mr. Deuprey verbally
amended the report.
After reading the report Mr. Deuprey
gracefully threw a wad of balm at Patton
by saying that the Democratic party was
ceeply indebted to the gentleman for his
patriotic self-denial in sacrificing himself
against the will of his friends and against
the judgment of many members of bis
party. Deuprey's motion that a committee
of three be appointed to draft and have en
irrossed resolutions of thanks to be pre
sented;to Mr. Patton instead of a seat in
Congress was passed. There were ooother
Democratic candidates to thank. Bat the
ghosts of Banquos Maddux and Kelly
grinnei sardonically.
Wuile Mr. Patton was being eulogizeo.
and getting thanks voted him Maddux of
the Seventh, who would not resign, sat in
a front seat and looked meditatively into
an iron cuspidor.
Then Patton shouldered his cross and
came to the front to describe his cheerful
ness. He told of placing his withdrawal
in the hands of the committee two weeks
ago, and he said : "Notwithstanding none
of the .Democratic members of the com
mittee lived south of San Francisco I had
confidence in their integrity, and trust
fully rested my case in their hands."
Then he got to that fateful last Saturday
night.
"At a late hour," he said, "I received a
telephone message at my rooms and I
went at once to tLe committee's head
quarters, where I saw Mr. Lane, who pri
vately told me that the Populists were
bound to iJarlow and that unless I with
drew the whole plan would fail. lat once
went before the committte and withdrew.
I feit when I did so that I was giving up a
seat in Congress, for I felt that I might
win in a thre-=-cornered fight."
The devoted stand of his own Demo
cratic friends, he said, would ever be a
proud memory.
"I received no votes from the Populists
and I owe nothing to that party,' 1 he
added.
Patton moved the adoption of the re
port.
Deuprey read the pledge which all the
fusion candidates must sign in triplicate
promising the three parties to vote in
Congress, if elected, forthe fr<Â»e and un
limited coinage of silver at 16 to 1 without
consent, against all funding schemes and
for the speedy building of the Nicaragua '
canal by the Government.
Samuel Kohlman of San Francisco !
moved to take up the report by districts, '
and Gavin McNab made the point of
order that the report must be consitierei
as a whole, for if the report should not be
approved as to one district the entire re
port would fail.
E. P. Mogan moved to postpone consid
eration until a later special meeting to be
held next Saturday, and Deuprey urged
that it was absolutely necessary for the
report to be accepted or rejected then.
John W. Mitchell of Los Angeies, who
made a lung and loyal tigut for the de- i
feated Patton, stood up eloquently for the
report, saying tbat if objection were raised
it ought to come from Southern California.
"Il is true," said Mitchell, "that a mis
take has been made by reason oi the em- j
pire county of Los Angeles being cnt out i
of the possibility of having a representa- :
tive in tne next Congress, but we are will- \
ing to bow our neads to the inevitable as â 
Democratic patriots rather tban as fusion !
politicians." â¢
While M. F. Tarpey talked for the re
port, urging that the electoral fusion as
well was in the balance, Mitchell did in- :
effective camp-meeting work in the rear:
with Kohlman, Mogan and other friends
of Joseph P. Kelly. Josenh P. Hayes
made a speech in behali of "a square
deal.'" and Mogan explained that he !
wanted a postponement, because the re
port was not finished until 1 a. m. that I
day, and it should receive careful consid- |
eration.
Mogan's amendment was lost by a vote :
oi ft to 74. the affirmative voters being E. I
P. Mosan, Samuel Kohlman, Joseph P.
Hayes, C. W. Wittbeck, J. J. Byrne, J. J.
Lvtich, Thomas E. Scully and J. A. |
Mc-ulieuh of San Francisco and M. F.
Swift of San Mateo.
Tbe deal was finished so far as the Dem- I
ocrats were concerned, but there was no
applause.
CAMPAIGN FUNDS.
Provision Made for Greasing: the ;
Wheels of Democracy.
W. J. Brobecfe at ence inquired about I
campaign fnnds with which to help ilect
ti.c.-e candidates, and that started an in- i
teresting discussion of the financial ques- '
tion.
Mr. Brobeck made some of the boys at j
the rear turn pale by moving that each
member of the State Central Committee
bÂ«> assessed $30, which he was at liberty to
nay himself or rustle up in any way.
if. J. Laymance was w'lling to stand
$30, out he wanted to know what had be
come of that popular appeal for funds
that was ordered two weeks ago and what
the unreDorting finance committee was
doing.
Then Chairman Alford broke down and
made a confession.
"I have met with the finance committee
at all its meeting?," he said. "I have
witnessed its active efforts to obtain
money and I have witnessed its absolute
failure. The committee could report
nothing but faiinre. It has received but
$600 or $700, and that wouldn't pay even
the pre en: printing bills. The popular
appeai has been delayed by the fusion ne
gotiations. 1 believe the finance commit
tee recommended this proposed $30 assess
ment. It is impossible now to pay the
expense bills of speakers."
Max Popper, ex-chairman of the State
Central Committee, who has had much ex
perience in raising campaign funds ana in
raying bills himself, made a vigorous
roar.
'It is a rule in many other States," he
said, "that every member of ihe State Cen
tral Committee mu-t pay an :'.s~essment of
$100 ;or the honor before he takes his seat.
In Tammany not a member can take his
eat un:ii he has paid his assessment of
$100. This committee made a $100 assess
ment once and just rive paid it. A $30 as
sessment ought to raise about $3000 â not
sufficient, but enough to send out a good
many speakers."
Mr. Popner grew indknant with his
progress and turned on the hard-shell of
fice-holders.
"We have men in this committee," be
declared, "who hold public positions but
who will not c< ntribute a nickel. Why,
the other day a Government official who is
drawing a $4500 salary was asked to con
tribute fora ratification meetinc and he
sent the magnificent sum of $5. This
thing ought to be stopped."
J. A. Filcher of the finance committee
gave the candid warnin â¢ ttiat he had pre
pared a list of every Democratic public
official, great and small, and of every
prominent Democrat, and they would be
called on. Mr. Filcher also sent warning
to Jim Budd and all his merry crew.
"I am gome up to-morrow evening," he
said, "to call on the Governer and those
about him, and I expect to get $1000 up
there."
J. Marion Brooks resolutely moved to
amend Brobeck's resolution by making
the $30 assessment absolute and nersonal,
and tnough D. AÂ» Ostrom of Yuba re
called thai it cost the country members
"S2O" every trp to attend a meeting of
the committee Brooks' amendment car
rieu and the assessment was declared as a
starter.
With this exhibition of ways and no
means the committee adjourned until
Saturday, the 26th inst
JUNTA POSTPONEMENT.
Campaign Committee Troubles
Put Over to Thurs
day.
The Junta campaign committee held a
meeting last night at which little was
accomplished. It was decided to postpone
the naming of the 140 deiegates-at-large to
the municipal convention until next
Thursday evenin-r. Tne Popper-McXab
fighters of Rainey were unabie to get the
votes necessary for their plan of rescind
ing the present order and appointing out
right a small convention, and the coup
was regretfully abandoned. The post
ponement, they hope, will afford a chance
to do something to save the convention
from Rainey's grasp.
The ten extra delegates at large, whicn
were to be named by the whole campaign
committee of twenty members, presented
a problem in distribution which was
solved by a gamble. The names of the
twenty members of the committee were
put into a hat and M. C. Hassett drew
therefrom ten names, each of which is to
narue one of the extra delegates. Tne
lucky members were Chairman Sullivan,
Secretary McGovern, M. Xierney, Samuel
Braup.hart, R. L. Mann, James Butler, A.
A. Watkins, M. C. Hassett, J. N. Meuli,
Dr. J. W. Gavigan.
DIVORCE PROCEEDINGS.
Two Decrees Granted â Other Cases on
Trial.
Divorces were granted yesterday morn
ing to Fanny Blondeau from her husband,
Frederick Blondeau, on tne grounds of
cruelty and failure to provide, and to Cath
erine Cavey from her husband, John T.
Cavey, on the grounds of desertion and

granted in default of the appearance of the
defendant.
Lizzie S. Beals was granted a divorce
from Jtdward C. Beals. The plaintiff was
granted the custody of the children.
The Woodward divorce suit was reopened
before Judge Seawell yesterday. The case
was heard some time ago. but the court
deemed tbe evidence insufficient and the
relief asked for was denied for the time be
ing. Mrs. Woodward asked leave to offer
further evidence of her husband's cruelty
and she was permitted to do so.
Tne case of Lizzie Stirippel against
Carpey Sirippel, for divorce, was on trial
ail day before Judge Hunt. The com
plaint is for cruelty.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 8, 1896.
PLAYS OF THE
PRESENT WEEK
Steve Brodie and "The
Bowery " at the
California.
HORSES AT THE GRAND.
"All the Comforts ot a Home"
by the Alcazar Stock
Company.
"MME. SANS GENE" CONTINUED.
The Frawley People Give "The Wife"
at the Columbiaâ At the
Orpheum.
This City has had several opportunities
of making observations of pugilists, so
ciety women and professional beauties
who have taken to the stage as stars en
the strength of their reputations. Last
night another freak actor, in the person of
Steve Brodie, the famous bridge-jumper,
made his San Francisco debut at the Cali
fornia Theater in a lurid melodrama writ
ten especially for him called "On the
Bowery."
Mr. Brodie did a good deal better than
most of his predecessors who have cone
on the stage to give an admiring public
the chance of beholding them. His act
ing was engagingly unaffected and
natural. Once or twice he seemed
to feel stage fright, and then he
laughed, which made tne audience laugh
back again and placed every hing on a
pleasant ana friendly footing, for Brodie
was always strictly "onto himself," as
they say in the Bowery, and the eallery
boys realized that his laugh was not a
laugh to be despised. Once, when a num
ber of floral tributes had been handed
over the footlights, Brodie burst into ex
temporaneous speech.
"I appreciateâ" he began.
"Louder," cried the gallery.
"If yez don't hear me, all right," re
plied the king of the Bowery, with a
touch of hauteur in his voice. "1 appre
ciate this reception, because it's cost me
$5000 to open here. 1 didn't want to tell it
to tbe newspapers, but it's a fact that my
scenery was all destroyed by the Southern
Pacific. I would not disappoint you.
though, so I had new scenery painted. I
hope you'll like my company; they-' re
rough and tough, but they're the right
sort."
Brodie was right in characterizing his
actors as "rough and tough," but as the
scenes occurred in the classic precincts of
the Bowery, they were only acting up to
the requirements of their roles. The play
was evidently written with a view to let
ting Brodie evolve in the sphere in which
he was fitted to shine. The virtuous
hero, a newspaperman who had once given
Brodie a "write-up," is accused of "rob
bing" a safe, which, of coarse, was really
robbed by the villain. Brodie, mindful of the
write-up, harbors the virtuous hero in his
saloon on the Bowery, and stands off the
"cops" when they come to arrest him.
The only witness to the robbery is a young
woman, whom the villain has betrayed. He
causes her through his accomplices to be
thrown from Brooklyn bridge, but Brodie, who
has overheard the plot, dives in ana rescues
her. He also saves the same young woman
from a fire and finally succeeds in foiling the
villain and entirely clearing the character of
the newspaperman.
This plot is eked out with a number of
Bowery specialties. There is a "sidewalk"
merchant, Isidore Michelowsky, a gentleman
of Hebraic extraction, who gives some most
amusing monologues, though they are tinged
here and there with that disregard for con
ventionalities which is characteristic of the
Bowery.
Isidore was well played by Gns Yorke.
There was a trifle too much of Dismal
Delaney, the "bum" tough, William Mitchell
acted the role amusingly. Abner Higgins, a
countryman, was another ! feature of the
Bowery scenes, and a fierce fight, with gloves,
between a dude and a tough helped to keep
things going in :he saloon scene.
It was in the saloon scene that Steve Brodie
had his .happiest moments. He administered
I justice and beer with an autocratic hand. The
unruly and the "bums" were thrown out, the
bullies were snubbed and the dead broke were
reiused drinks, and Brodie kept on good terms
with them all in a way which proclaimed him
to be at once the king and the idol oi the
Bowery.
The staging of the play was good and the
acting, apart from the specialties, was of the
usual melodramatic school. The audience
was large, but it was only by the gallery that
"On the Bowery" was received with any mani
festations of delight.
The Baldwin.
Bardou's comedy, "Madame Sans Gene," dis
plays a fine drawing quality nt the Baldwin.
The second week was begun last evening aDd a
large and delighted audience attested appre
ciation of the excellent performance.
Kathryn Kidder as Madame Sans Gene, Au
gustus Cook as Napoleon and James Cooper as
De Neipperg were recalled several times at the
close of the act where the spirited scene occurs
in which the Austrian is seeking an interview
with the Empress.
The Na;ol-onic make-up of Augustus Cook
is remarkable. The actor's interpretation of
the impatience of the Emperor over the con
duct of his own family is true to history as
taught in the memoirs of Bourrienue and
Mine. Remusat. The comedy possesses action,
fiber and keen dramatic interest, and in the
Hands of the capable people at the Baldwin is
registering success of the first order.
At the Columbia.
The Frawley company played Belasco and
De Milte's well-known four-act drama, "The
Wife.' with Blanche Bates in the title role.
This strong emotional piece has been given
here a number of times, but not better than It
was rendered by the excellent company now
play ins at the Columbia. The Frawleys have
tried all the emotions and seem p ret tv much
at home in all of them. Miss Bates' work in
"The Wife" is a melody in a plaintive chord;
in fact, her natural appearance is suggestive
of a Puritan girl or a nun, as #adcess and
tears and sobs come readily to her. Wilton
Lackaye as John Rutherford filled that
noble role with quiet dignity. Hiss
Lansing Rowan as Lucille Terrant
and Daniel Frawley as Robert Gray were
fully up to the standard, while Tyrone" Power
as silas Truman of the Produce 'Change
and Harry Corson Clarke as Major Homer G.
Putnam, were two old gentlemen who were
faithful to each other, peppery and delightful.
"The Wife" will be given the rest of the week
to bo followed in the next by the comedy "A
Matrimonial Maze."
â¢ââ¢ â â¦ â -
At the Tivoli.
Last night began the ninth and last week of
the present grand opera season. "Lucia di
Lammermoor" was the opera. It will be
remembered that this was the lyric work with
which the season began.
Mme. Ida Valerga, in the title role was most
enthusiastically received. After the mad
scene she was called and recalled. Mme.
Valerga has become identified with this City
and her success here is always assured.
It is, not surprising that the others of the
cast showed to more advantage ihan on the
night when they were first seen here in
"Lucia." Most of them, particularly De Vrie.s
Mlchelena and Abramoff have become popular
favorites. De Vrles was particularly fine last
night in the role of Henry Ashton, and his solo
in the first act aroused a veritable enthusiasm.
Michelena as Edgar and Abramoff as Ray
mond were deserving of the highest prime.
All the others did well. To-night "Romeo and
Juliet" will be the opera.
The Alcatar.
That popular screaming farce, "All the Com
forts of Home," was presented at the Alcazar
last evening to a fairly good-sized audience.
It was offered with an innovation, and that
was the substitution of a female for a male
serrant at the Pettibones. The presentation !
of Katy, the maid, by Hattie Foley was fully as \
pleasing and laughable as when one of the '
sterner sex appeared as the good-natured but |
somewhat erratic servant, and her rendition i
of the part excited the risibilities of the audi- i
ence. The fun was fast and furious, and it '
served to keep all in good humor from begin- I
ning to end.
Those who went there to enjoy a lauzh had j
in the many comic situations plenty to laugh i
at. Violet Aubrey appeared for the first time !
with the Alcazar Company in the character of !
Emily Pettibone. filling the part in an accept
able manner. Harold Vizard as August Mc-
Snath and W. A. Belasco as the shoeuaker also
made their debut with this company. The
other members of this company did their part
to keep up the interest in the performance.
Tne tarce will be kept on the boards during
the week-
Grand Opera-Honae.
"The Great Brooklyn Handicap," a race
comedy-drama, was given at the Grand Opera
house last nignt with a number of striking
tableaux and some gooa realistic stage effects, i
The greatest scene was the one showing the
handicap race, in which there are a number of
real horses ridden by jockeys.
Another scene ihat won much applause was
the one in which the heavy villain drove on
the stage a pair of spirited horses and was in- |
terrupted in endeavoring to reach the ferry to j
make his escape. A fine effect in this scene ;
was produced by tne approach of two cable-cars,
actual size, with gripmea in regular â¢
uniform, at the moment of the arrest. This
M pleased the audience that the curtain had
to be raised three times. There is a good deal '
of action in the play and a good opportunity j
is given to Edwarl J. Herron, the comedian, I
and Lottie Williams, the soubrette, to display
their versatility and specialties. Julia Blanc i
assumed the character of Viola Hertz, the j
ward of Banker Ciews, one outside of her
usual line, and by her capital rendition of it
astonished those who have been in the habit
of seeing her in old woman's parts. Mortimer
Snow as a New York clubman was exceedingly
sad, wnile Fred J. Butler as a chevalier a'in
dustrie was up to his usual standard.
At the Orpheum.
The new features at the Orpheum this week
have come just in the nick of time, for the old
bill was beginning to grow monotonous.
Marguerite, the contortion dancer, is the
most remarkable of the new turns, though tne
Irish comedy of Fergnson and Mack won more
demonstrative signs of approval from the
audience. Marguerite is a chic, graceful young
person who twiiU her flexible little body into I
every imaginable and unimaginable shape and !
who dances prettily. Contortions ore gener- |
ally painful things to behold, but Marguerite I
ties herself into knots with the cheerful care- |
lessness of a chid at play, and-ao evidently
enjoys the performance that contortions are j
for once divested of their usual horrors.
Ferguson an<i Mack's performance would not !
commend itse'.f to the esthetic mind, but there ;
was plenty oi frolic in their knockabout j
comedy and some ot their jokes were new and ;
pointed. Bellman and Moore did an excellent ]
turn, which took the form of two sane people
meeting in a lunatic asylum, each believing j
the other to oe crazy. The comedy is not a
new one, but their embellishments in the
I shape of songs and fiances won them well
deserved applause. Miss Moore's good looks'
helped to make her clever dancing more effec
tive, and Beliman's fine voice obtained him
several encores.
The Vassar quartet grave a sort of drawing- |
room operetta, in which they showed that j
they could sing, as well as act. J: mes A. i
Sturges, the male member of the quartet, is ;
possessed of a particularly fine voice. Terry j
and Elmer did aii eccentric comedy and danc
ing turn, which had nothing particular to
commend it.
The hold-overs include Lvdia Yeamans-
Titus. in new songs ; R chard Pitrot. with im
personations, more or less true to life, of Mayor '
Sutro and other local celebrities; Filson and
Erroll, in their comedy, "Men vs. Women";
Miss Nellie Maguire and Albini, the card-trick
man.
At the Chutes.
The bill in the Casino at the Cbutes is filled J
with clever acts and specialties this week, and
among the most notable features are the funny j
little Japanese acrobats, who almost turn in- '
side out, the Masons, horizontal-bar per
formers, and Jules Korto, equilibrist.
The mile bicycle race on the stage between
two young ladies is very exciting, and last
evening resulted in a tie. Antonio Pirri I
dashes down tt.e chutes on a Dicycle and j
Isada in the lake uninjured at 10 o'clock !
every evening, and his performance is folly
equai to that of Conn Fredericks, the "Demon
Cvciist." There will be a special programme
to-morrow afternoon in honor of Admission
day, and at 4:30 Pirri will coast the chutes.
BICYCLISTS' FAVORITES.
Friction at Last Night's Meeting
of the Municipal
League.
The Report of the N minating Com
mitte? Is at LrDg.h Ordered
R j?cted.
The Wheelmen's Municipal League held
a special meetine at 441 Golden Gate ave
nue yesterday evening. Judge Kerrigan
explained that the calling of the meeting
was due to the fact that the regular meet
ing on the third Wednesday in the month
would be too late to do anything with the
different* municipal leaders. There was
considerable discussion over the manner
in which the work was to be carried on.
Some ol the wheelmen counseled delay,
while others insisted on pushing the mat
ter to an issue. Those who favored an ag
gressive campaign finally carried the day.
The executive committee made its re
port and in it asked that the matter o:
going into the next campaign be laid over
until the Supreme Court had decided
upon the tenure of office of the incum
bents of municipal offices. R. C. Lennie
was the first to object. "Now is the time
to act," said he. "It we keep on dilly
dallying Wi will be too late. We ought to
pledge ourselves at once."
C. JVlicbener pointed out that the com
mittee had not turned in a report, but the
minutes of its meeting would furnish all
information* The matter went over until
a report could be written. â¢'."â¢â 
The following questions, to be asked
candidates for office, were unanimously
adopted:
1. Are you a wheelman ? â  V ;
- 2. How long have you been a wheelman ?
3. To what, if any, organization do you be
long? " - , :i^
4. If elected to the Legislature will you vote
in favor of a bill declaring the bicycle bag
gage ?
5. If elected to the Legislature will you vote
in favor of the passage of a bill extending the
power, scope ami facilities of the Bureau of
Highways of this State?
6. If elected, will you vote in favor of the pas
sage of a bill amending the count}' govern
meut act in such a manner as to provide for
uniformity in bicycle ordinances passed by
county Boards of Supervisors?
7. li elected, ill >ou vote for a bill amend
ing the county government act in Mich a
manner as to provide for the passage by
Boards of Supervisors or. ordinances embody
ing provisions tot 'he erection of guide-boards
and mile-stones?
Charles A. Adams, on behalf of the law
and legislation committee, said it had
been decided to have a bill framed to be
known as "the wheelmen's bili." It would
cover the baggage question and others
equally interesting to wheelmen. He pro
posed that a committee of live from the
Municipal League be appointed to meet
with a siruiiar committee from the Lea-ue
of American Wheelmen to frame the bill.
Jud^e Kerrican thought tne committee
should b<Â» appointed at once, so that it
could go before the conventions and get a
plank favorable to wheelmen put in.
"Some decisive move should be made this
week," said lie. "Tnis is an immense un
dertaking, and we should get to work to
night."
The motion was carried and the follow
ing committees were appointed:
Municipal League â Charles A. Adams, A. G
Macfariand. T. B. McGinnis, J. W. Maeuire
and P. J. Hyde. 8
League of American Wheelmenâ R. M
Weicn, G. W. Strong, C. Michener, F h'
Duuny, J. W. Cuffroth.
These gentlemen will act with the rights
and piivi'pges comiuittee of the League of
American Wheelm-n.
A resolution thanking the press and
offering its representatives every facility
to get the news was carried unanimously.

Lennie started another discussion by
asking who had the power to form a
municipal .-'late. He moved that a com
mittee of three be appointed to name â 
ticket.
Motuig thoucht that when a slate was
named it should only contain the names
of a I'<>nnocratic Supervisor, a Republican
Supervisor and the Superintendent of
Streets.
Adams threw cold water on the scene
and saul it they ask d for one office tbe
wheelmen might as well ask for all. He
pointed out that the office of Superin
tendent >f Streets was the most important
one In municipal government and they
could not expect to get it. He counseled
deiay ami said the bagnage bill and the
repaVinu of Market street were enough for
one year.
The report of the executive committee
on ;he matter was called for. It recom
mended that power be conferred on it to
make nominations and confer with the
leaders o; sne different parties. This was
finally agreed to and a rec ss was taken to
allow' toe committee a chance to name
it- men.
After considerable deliberation the com
mittee reported that it was in favor of J.
S. Con well and R. M. Welch for Super
visors and ueo:ge W. Eider for Superin
tendent oi Streets.
Maeuire made a minority report in
which ne said the action was ill-timed and
would do harm. He thought the men
sought to be indorsed should first be con
sulted. Tne action taken was not in good
taste, and was more the action of school
boys than oi men.
Adams said he thought Maguire had
changed his mind on tne subject and the
latter indignantly denied tbe charge. He
thought the matter should not be rushed,
and whiie he favored the indorsing of a
Superintendent of Streets and two Super
visors still h- objected to the men being
named ai tbat time.
Adams moved that tbe report be laid on
the table, and Micbener moved that tne
report be recommitted. The matter was
disease I pro and con., and finally Adams
dropped his moron and made another re
jecting .:ie report altogether. This was
carried by a vote of 16 to 8, and tbe meet
ing adjourned.
OLYMPIC ELECTION.
Members Who Will Role the Club
I urinjj the Next Twelve
Months.
The annual election of officers of the
Olympic Club took place last evening and
w\s a very quiet affair.
There being no opposition to the regu
lar ticket, the members paid little atten
tion to the election, and a3 a result only
17<i votes were cast.
F. W. Eaton, the retiring president, re
ceived twelve votes, which were cast by
members who supported Eaton because of
hi> valuable services to t c club and the
frenerotu manner in which he treated the
wheelmen of the club who happened to
visit his place of residence in San Mateo
when on road runs and pleasure trips.
The following is a result of the election:
President, George A. N'ewhall, 164 votes;
vice-president, Henry J. Crocker, 176; sec
retary, Milton S. L:i"tharn, 174; treasurer,
Henry B. Russ, 176; leader. Howard P.
Taylor Jr., 175; Captain, C. Percy Morse,
174; diroctorsâ Frank P. McLennan, 175;
J. 08. Gunn. 175; Joseph P. Kelly, 170;
Alex. C. Forsyth, 168; Frank A. Vail, 172.
Tue judges of the (-lection were: W. P.
Humphrey*, F. V. Kineton F. W. Gra
ham, Steve Casady and Leo Pockwitz.
The installation of the newly elected
officers will take place on Monday evening
next.
The newly elected leader, Howard P.
Taylor, states that the club will have the
greatest football team this year that has
ever organized this side o"f the Rocky
Mountains, a:.d that football will be the
feature of outdoor sports.
ONCE M ORRIS BENEDICT.
Senator Biggy Again Takes Unto Him-
â  elf â  Wife.
Senator William J. Biggy entered the
matrimonial estate very quietly yesterday
morning for the second irre. the bride of
his choice being Miss Lucy McDonough,
the bosom friend and confidant of bis de
ceased wile. The ceremony, by specia
dispensation, took place at 10 o'clock, m
Holy Cross Church, to which the groom's
family is attached by tbe tenderest ties.
It was solemnized by Rev. Father Mc-
Ginty, their ii:e-long pastor, assisted by
the Rev. Father McQuade. The groom
was supported by Mr. Arthur McGinty,
brother of the officiating priest, as best
man, and the bride was attended by her
cousin, Miss Maria McDonough, as brides
maid. Only a few immediate relatives
were in the bridal train.
At the close of tbe religious rites the
little party was driven to the residence of
Thomas McDonough, the bride's father,
where the wedding breakfast was served.
The happy couple left on the afternoon
train for Monterey.
A CELESTIAL ORATOR.
Mrs. De Silva Astonishes the Woman's
Occidental Board.
A clever address on the women of Asia
was given yesterday at the Chinese Mis
sion Home, 920 Sacramento street, by Mrs.
de Silva, a Chinese lady who has passed
all her examinations as a physician in
New York. Mrs. de Siiva, who wears
American dress, speaks fluently in ele
gant English. She was accompanied by
her husband, a tall, handsome Spaniard,
who seemed very proud of his accom
plished wife.
Mrs. de Silva began her address by de
scribing what famous women had accom
plished in the past in Chinese and Japan
ese history. She also described the intel
ligence of the dowager Empress of China
aud alluded to what she has done for the
Flowery Kingdom. Speaking oi Asiatic
women in general Mrs. de Silva said that
they are beginning to have many educa
tional advantages, in fact as many as they
are equal to in their present state of de
velopment.
The ladies of the Occidental Board were
so pleased with the Chinese lady's address
that they at once secured her services for
tLeir synodical meeting, which will occur
on the 17th of next month.
At the death of Queen Elizabeth 3004
dresses were in her wardrobe, of which
two only were of silk.

GARRET A. HOBART, of New Jersey
rrKCTION NOVEMBER 3. 1896.
All aboard for Stockton.- ' i
-. â¢ I
.Don't fail to celebrate Admission day. .
California patriotism can never be de
veloped too much. %
Bryan is a free-trader, and though he
dodges his record he cannot hide it from
a reading people.
The Populist who says he is satisfied
with the kind of fusion he is getting would
say most anything.
The visit of the Native Sons will not
surprise Stockton, but it is 16 â¢to 1 that
Stockton will surprise them.
Day by day the demand for protection
increases and by election day it will be the
universal voice of the people.
It is a courteous thing to speak of it as a
I'onocrat fusion, though as a matter of
fact it is more like a fizzle than a pop. I
It is clearly the aim of Democratic fn
siouists to put up Populists to lead forlorn
hopes, while the Democrats gather in the
spoils.
The, Native Sons will lay aside party |
politics for a time and unite on the broad
platform of love for California and pride
in its greatness.
.
Straight Democrats and middle-of-the- !
road Populists can sympathize with one
another, for both have been betrayed by
the fusion gang.
The disclosure of the whisky scandal in
South Carolina affords Tillman an oppor
tunity to co home and show that his pitch
fork is of some use in a muck pile.
Eastern people will continue to wrangle
and quarrel over politics this week, but
the Californians will get together, Hold a
love feast and give the Democrats a pass- i
ing chance to enjoy themselves a little.
Until you have seen the home industries
exhibited at the Mechanics' Fair you do
not know what possibilities of develop
ment there are in California if we only
promote them by a proper system of pro
tection.
What will it profit a Populist to vote for |
a Democrat who, as soon as he gets into
office, will vote against protection to the
industry of Populists and denounce the
Populists themselves as cranks and so
cialists?
The protest against an increased assess
ment of San Francisco should not be left
to newspapers altogether. Every asso
ciation .of citizens should speak and the
proposed wrong should be condemned and
denounced by the voice of all.
To obtain protection for the industries
of California we must concede protection
for the industries of other States, we must
support the party that advocates National
protection and will establish it for the wel
fare of all sections of the Union.
The contemplation of what would in
evitably result from free coinage and free
trade has caused Democratic enthusiasm
to be sicklied o'er with a pale cast of
thought, and as a consequence the . boys
are not shouting as much as they did.
Two street Arabs, a Democrat and a
Populist, found a cigar. i: Let us form a
fusion," said the Democrat. "I'll smoke
the cigar and you do the spitting." "I'll
do it," said the Populist, and straightway
he spat upon the cigar. Then there was a
ruction.
From all parts of the State we learn that
[Republicans who thought of voting the
free silver ticket are coming back to the
ranks and will vote with the party of in
ternational bimetallism. They cannot
take free silver when joined with free trade
and Bryan ism.
From the results obtained it seems the
Southern Pacific Company has had more
to do with fixing up fusion on Congress*
men than either the Democrats or the
Populists, and of course the people under
stand the big corporation is not fusing
things for nothing.
Â»
Almost any kind of a much advertised
stump orator can draw an idle crowd as
Bryan does, but when people go hundreds
of miles to hear an orator, as they are now
doing to bear McKinley, we may be sure
the speaker is one whom the people trust,
and whom they will be plad to follow.
Every one of McKinley's speeches is ap
propriate to the occasion and to the audi
ence, and thus no two are alike, while
Bryan goes around repeating the same
thoughts in almost the same words from
place to place, and thus it comes about
that people continue to fihd McKinley's
speeches fresh and interesting, while those
of Bryan bare become stale, fiat and
wearisome. ....
TWO MONETARY SYSTEMS.
We are "unalterably otposed lo every
measure calculated to debate our currency or
impair the credit of our country. We are,
j therefore, ojjposrd to tlie free coinage of silver,
except by international agreement uith the
hading commercial nations of the world,
which we pledge ourselves to proviote, and,
until such agreement can be obtained the ex
isting gold standard must be preserved. All
our silver ayd paper currency must be main
tained at a parity with gold, and we favor
â  all measures designed to maintain inviolably
the obligations of the United States and all
our vioney, whether in coin or paper, at the
urescnt standard, the standard of the most
enlightened nations oftfie earth.â Republican
j National Platform.
The declaration of the Republican party
| on the money question means that all
forms of our money, paper and metallic,
must be maintained at parâ that no dol
lar shall be at a discount. The Republi
can party is composed of wage-earners
and business men, and the party's stand
upon the money question is in accordance
with their experience in practical busi
ness life. It is not reasonable to suppose
that they would declare for a monetary
i system that was likely to injure values of
existing property accumulations, nor is it
to be supposed that they would undertake
j to retard prospective trade expansion by
j adopting forms of money of different
j standards of purchasing power. Kow
, ever partisan a man may be he draws the
' line at self-interest, and any sensible man
; would abandon his party if it undertook
j to disturb his business operations.
The position of the Republican party
1 may be considered, therefore, as the out
come of the experience of labor and capi
tal. After working together for years to
their mutual advantage they ure satisfied
that the basis of their successful and har
monious co-operation has been dollars
that were without variableness in their
i relation to one another as measures of
I values. If thea the declarations of the
| party on the question of money are the
! result of wide and varied experience in the
activities of sctual trade, industry and
commerce, it stands to reason that they
should be trusted before the declarations
of theorists and experimentalists, espe
cially when it is known that the theories
of these theorists are diametrically op
posed to what practical experience has
demonstrated to be true.
To show the difference between the posi
i tion of the Republican party and the
Bryanites upon the money question we
quote the money plank of that party. It
is as follows:
"We.demand the free and unlimited coinage
of both gold and silver at the present legal
ratio of 16 to 1 without waiting for the aid or
consent of any other natron. We demand
that Mm standard silver dollar shall be full
legal tender, equally with gold, for all debts,
public and private, and ice favor such legis
lation as will prevent for the future the de
monetization of any kind of legal-lender
vioney by private contract."
It will be observed that the purpose of
the Bryanites is to ignore our commercial j
relations with all foreign customers of
American farm and other products and
| make the continuance of such relations
contingent upon their accepting without
question a monetary system they do not I
think is a safe one. This brings up the
question, would foreign buyers conform to
a system they believe to be ruinous to
them? The presumption is they would
rattier sever all business relations with us
than do business upon a system of forms
of money of different purchasing power.
If we elected to continue to do business
with thftm the consequence would be that
we should have gold monometallism for
i our foreign trade and silver monometallism
I tor our domestic trade. Moreover, our
! silver dollars would stand in the same re
lation to outside trade and commerce that
Mexican silver dollars now stand in trade
| operations with us, which is on the basis
of about 50 cents of our money for a Mex
ican silver coin of the denomination of $1.
The experience of commerce in all na
tions and in all ages is that tbe declara
tion of the Republican party on the money
question is in harmony with the unwrit
ten laws of trade interchange, and it is
also the experience of commerce that the j
theories of the Bryanites have always
worked ruin to trade and traffic when put i
in practical operation. The money ques
tion is not, therefore, a political but a 'â 
commercial question, and if the testimony
which the experience of commerce gives
it be taken the Bryan monetary system
should be rejected without argument.
EvUt exist; poverty exists: wool men, mul
titudes of them between the Atlantic and
the Pacific, are heart-broken over the loss of
their flocks; farmers have debts and cannot
get their products to market; many good men
are out of employment, and holders of cupi
tal, ahrays cautious, do not use it; manufac
tories are empty and silent. Yes, this it all
true. But, citizens, let us reverse the wheels.
Give our best men the reins of Government
and you will soon see a change in the. tid*.
Good tariff, generous reciprocity, lionest
money in able and unselfish hands will make
a marvelous change.â General 0. 0. Howard.
BUSINESS AND POLITICS.
Clubs and delegations from all parts of
the country are journeying to Canton to
pay their respects to Major McKinley. It
is noticeable, too, that for the most part
they are composed of workingmen and
farmers, which shows very clearly that
the "common people," as Bryan calls
them, know which side of their bread is
buttered, ?o to Â«peak. It is the common
people, if farmers and wage-earners are
"common people," who are sorely in need
of better times, and they know that pros
perity will not come to them unless they
stand by the man who is pledged to a
policy that guarantees better times. Poli
ticians are not "running" McKiniey's
campaign. It is in the hands of tbe great
army of men who are in enforced idleness
and who want work, and they are man
aging it to win. They are terribly in
earnest, because they know that there will
be no prosperous days for them unless
they defeat and rout the free- trade enemy
of American industry.
But one of the most striking demonstra
tions for McKinley and prosperity is fur
nished Dy Chicago. It is an organization
calling itself tbe "Commercial Men's Dem
ocratic McKinley Club." One thousand
of the club's members have arranged to
call upon Major McKinley at his home
next Saturday to assure him of their sup
port and influence. There never was just
such another political organization. No
member of it has ever voted a ticket other
than the Democratic. They are still Dem
ocrats, they claim, but they believe that
not only their own but all the business
interests of the country are being threat
ened, and that so far as they are concerned
it is their duty to rally to the aupport of
the only candidate who stands for souna
business principles, even though they do
not like certain of his declarations con
cerning the tariff. What they want is
security to their business enterprises and
encouragement to expand their volume of
trade, and they know they will set neither
if Bryan is elected.
It is not surprising, however, that
thoughtful Democratic business men and
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 8, 1896.
workingmen should not hesitate to sever
the ties which bind them to their old
party and declare for McKinley. In the
first place their own party's machinery
has been captured and turned against
every tradition and principle of the party,
and in the second place they are driven to
choose between a'government policy that
will give the country a season of peace
and prosperity or a season of business agi
tation and uncertainty. Naturally, a man
who has money invested in a business en
terprise would not want his investment
forced to sustain a loss, nor would the
workingman who wants opportunity to
earn wages like to be obliged to remain in
idleness, hence it is quite natural that
business men and wage men should be
found working for the election of the one
who can be trusted to protect their inter
ests. It is not politics that is leading so
many Democrats to the support of Mc-
Kinley. It is to their own business inter
ests to do bo.
My views are substantially that there is but
one issue to be presented to the people of the
United States. The Democratic Convention
at Chicago made a distinct declaration of war
upon the constitution of the United States.
The issue, therefwe, is not financial nor
economic, but tt concerns tlie perpetuity of
republican institutions. In the presence of
this issue all otlicr questions sink into insig
nificance, just as they did when civil war
threatened the existence of the Government. â
Hon. Ahram S. Hewitt.
FUSION AND FIZZLE.
It is the unexpected that happens.
When a few oflice-seeking Democrats and
Populists undertook through their inter
ested friends to arr ange for a fusion of the
voting strength of both parties in order
that these office-seekers might attain the
desired spoils, it was everywhere pre
dicted that the result would be confusion.
The prediction has not been fulfilled.
Fusion has not brought forth confusion as
yet, nor is it likeiy to do so. It has been
simply a fizzle.
The difficulties inherent in the fusion
plan have been found to be inseparable.
Each party has candidates for office, and
the candidates of neither party who think
they have any chance of success have
cured to surrender that chance to the
candidate of the other party. The Dem
ocratic managers endeavored to avoid this
difficulty by getting the Populists to yield
the nominations in districts where there
is & prospect of success, and accepting
nominations where there is little better
than a forlorn hope. Thus Maguire, a
rank free-trade Democrat, was to have the
Fourth District, where he may possibly
win, while to a Populist would be given
the nomination in the Fifth, where there
is no more chance of his election than
there is of Bryan carrying the United
States.
The scheme of the Democrats, how
ever, has not worked. It has not even
done enough to produce confusion. The
Democratic candidates for office have re
fnsed to come down even in districts where
they have no chance of election. Some of
them intend to stay in the field for vindi
cation, some for the free advertising there
is in the race, and some for the principle
of the thing. Several Populists show an
equal fondness for principle, free adver
tising and vindication. Thus the clever
scheme goes awry and instead cf confusion
we have only the fizzle.
If there were no more in the campaign
than the election of Congressmen and
Presidential electors the failure cf the
fusion scheme would be complete. It hap
pens, however, that legislative and county
tickets are to be elected, and in all the
counties and legislative districts the cun
ning Democratic; managers are trying to
arrange for fusion that will give them the
spoils of office and leave to the Populists
only the Darren nominations in hopeless
districts. The exposure of the scheme of
central fusion has been complete enough
to open the eyes of many Populists to the
trick that is to be played on them if they
don't looK out, and most of them will cer
tainly refuse to be fooled in that way. It
remains to be seen how many the Demo
crats can fool. These are not likely to be
many. The watchful middle-of-the-road
Populists understand the situation about
as well as anybody, and they can bo relied
on to save their political friends from the
folly of fusion which means turkey for
Democrats but always crow for Populists.
In ISC*?, when free trade was the battle-cry
of our opponents, it was said that the farmers
v iinid follow this hentfi but it was not so. Jt
iias the cities which followed the free trade
heresy in the country. The country voted for
protection. So this year the fanners will vote
against free trade and free silver. They will
vote for a home market and for a dollar as
good as gold in every market in the world. â
McKinley.
THE SITUATION IN CALIFORNIA.
The political situation in California is
this: The Democrat* and Populists in
every county are fighting each other for
supremacy, ana the Republicans are
united and present a solid front. Rather
than be absorbed by the Populists very
many Democrats would rather see both
parties defeated. Not a few Populists
would rather see the Republican candidate
win than see a Democrat elected at the
expense of the Populist party. The fact
remains, however, that thus far the Popu
lists have been made tails to Democratic
dogs. That is to say, the Democrats have
generated the Populists out of what
was their due if fusion was intended. It
may be said, in fact, that thus far the
Democrats have exercised a kind of an
ownership over the Populists, giving them
justenougn crumbs to keep life in their
body. Against that sort of thing the self
respecting leaders of the Populist party
are rebelling most vieorously, and unless
they are unworthy of leadership they will
make the Democracy very sorry in Novem
ber that it tried to be wholly and entirely
a hoe.
The Republican party is, as we have
said, thoroughly united and of one ac
cord in every county. Unless every
sign is at fault McKinley and the
State tickets will be elected by splen
did majorities. The lenders of the
Democracy know that the majority of
the voters of California are against them,
but they hope to manage to have enough
Republicans stay at home to defeat their
ticket. For this reason it is all the more
important that there should be a club or
other organization wherever there are a
dozen Republicans. It will not do to
trust to luck when dealing with the Demo
cratic party. Besides, the Republican
ticket should have such a majority as will
make Democrats feel hereafter that it
would not be worth their while to try to
win.
The fight between the Democrats and
Populists ought to stimulate Republicans
all over the State to work all the harder.
They never had a better opportunity to
administer a crushing defeat to the
Democracy, and that is the kind of a de
feat every Republican should take a per
sonal interest in having administered.
To-day the Republican party presents a
soiid front, but there is room here and
there for more perfect organization, and
there are Republicans here and there who
are not yet members of working clubs.
Now, it never was more the duty of Re
publicans to do battle than now. Califor
nia needs*as a business proposition, the
application of the economic principles ot
the Republican party. She needs a pro
tective tariff, a merchant marine and true
bimetallism, but none of them will be se
cured unless the Republican ticket is
elected. Think on these things, and work
accordingly for Republican success, which
means California's best good.
There is only one rule by which we can live
usefully at a Nation or peacefully as citizens.
It is the rule of the laws constitutionally en
acted and finally interpreted by the judicial
tribunal appointed by the constitution. When
it becomes the rule that violence carries its
end we have anarchy â a condition as destruc
tive to honest labor and its rewards as death
it to the tissues of the human body.â Ex-
President Harrison.
WAGES AND FREE TRADE,
A brief study of industrial conditions,
presented in the local columns of The
Call to-day, shows that wages have been
I lowered and that business has been greatly
depressed under tbe Wilson bill. An
extract irom a recent article in the New
York Sun shows that wages abroad are
only a fraction of what they are in
America, and that England is in a better
condition than most European countries.
A glance at the wage table of England,
however, is discouraging to the American
artisan.
As workingmen look more closely into
the question they begin to see that the
conditions pictured by the great John
Bright threaten to come upon them here
under free trade. They see also that the
Democrats are dodging the real issue by
making so much noise about silver. Men
of all shades of political belief now under
stand that much of the lowering of wages
has been due to the Wilson bill, and that
a great part of the general business de
pression is due to the same slight experi
ence with Democratic ideas.
The lesson to bo learned from all this is
that the policy of William Jennings Bryan,
which is one of rank free trade, would
plunge the country into general ruin. A
man who predicted that free trade would
make good times is not the man to guide
the destinies of this country. Bryan is a
free trader.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
G. P. Althenour, a gold miner, at the Inter

says that he Is entirely satisfied to remain in

He says it is simply a case of the far-away
bird having fine feathers. When a man gets
to Alaska, and not till then, does the full force
of the Alaska situation break in upon him. No
single adjunct of instigation is at hand. The
traveler might, for most practical purposes, as
well be in the heart of Central Africa, with the
disadvantage of the intense cold and snow for
most of the year, against which he must de
fend himself as best he can.

he be stocked with bacon, beans and flour he
may call himself one of the elect.
The comfortable fortunes alleged to have
been made by different Alaska miners who
have arrived here are greatly discounted by
Mr. Althenour.
"I found on reaching Alaska and talking to
the partners and others who haa known some
of these men intimately," said Mr. Althenour,
"that for every $1000 alleged to have been
made on arrival in California or any of the
coast States the correct amount was apt to be
about $100. So that for every miner alleged
to have made $15,000 say, when I got at the
facts through their friends there it would be
aDOut $1500. These men knew all about what
dust and nujgets haa Deen got out. They had
seen the stuff weighed.
"The average story is simply a gross exag
geration. Nobody knows that better than the
men who are in Alaska digging for gold."
A VOTE WINNER.
San Bernardino Sun.
The Republican mass-meeting at the pavilion
last night was one of the most enthusiastic
political gatherings ever assembled in this
county. The general opinion, irrespective of
party affiliations, was that Hon. Samuel M.
Shortridge made one of the ablest speeches
ever heard in San Bernardino.
The address is published quite fully in to
day's Sun, and it is in every way worthy of
close study. The orator caught the salient
points of the campaign and put them forth in
a clear and logical manner.
Mr. Sliortridge showed how the Democrats
have failed to carry out their promises; ex
plained that free trade and ruin were syn
onyms; and yet he refused to admit that the
money question is the sole issue, though he
did not dodge it.
Coming to the money problem he showed
beyond question that the Republican party
nan always been the friend of silver andoi
sound money, a dollar worth 100 cents iv
every land on earth.
The strong point of the speech was its fair
ness and good humor, fiobody lelt the audi
ence in anger and hundreds went away to
ponder over the lessons learned.
We need more men like Mr. Shortridge in
California, men who will sacrifice tnelr pri
vate affairs for the good of ttie party, and who
gladly spend days and nights in teaching the
doctrines of good government in the hour of
their country's peril.

Who dropped the ring on that happy aay.
When Sausalito was wed to the Bay ?
The ocean rolled the wedding march,
And the pair were joined 'neath a cloudless arch.
The voice of the Bay. In deep, strong tone,
Made response in the serviceâ the two are one.
Joined forever by chanceless band,
The forceful Bay to the dinging land.

LADY'S WAIST WITH JACKET
FRONT.
A novel sleeve is shown here which will be
appreciated by the woman who wishes to keep
in advance of the styles. It is closely fitted,
with a circular cape-like top. The jacket
front is also much liked, allowing variety in
the shape of vest and blouse effects. The sim
plicity of the shape is a relief from the revers
and large collars.
A dress of plain black mohair had a vest of
yellow crepe with rows oi black insertion put
on lengthwiue. A frill of lace to match was
set on the edge oi the jacket front.
Three buttons of emeralds with a setting of
rhinestone were set on either side of the
jacket above the bust. A frill of creamy
guipure lace hung from the edge of the jacket,
oeing tapered toward the bottom, where it
ended at the darts.
A waist of black satin to be worn with a
skirt of black and white check, had a vest of
white chiffon gathered very full. At the side,
apparently set under the jacket, were frills of
white lace. A folded collar of brilliant green
ribbon was worn instead of the flaring collar

THE STEAMER WAS LOST

San Francisco Rescued
All on Board.
DEATH OF CAPTAIN F. MILLER
An Attack of Pneumonia Carried Off
the Well-Known Shipmaster
Suddenly.
The "Shire" line owns some of the hand
somest sailing vessels in the world, and of
the many that have come to San Francisco
the Ross-shire easily takes the palm. She
is a handsome four-masted bark, and Cap
tain Baxter, her commander, is one of the
most popular men in port. He has been a
regular trader here for years in the Dum
bartonshire, Kircudbrightshire, Clack
mannanshire and last of all the Ross
shire. The last is blest with a short name,
which is another ih ing in her favor. From
Glasgow to San Francisco the Ross-shire
established the record of 105 days, and on
her last trip she made the run here from
in 63 days, the smartest trip of the aeason.
Last year the Ross-shire went from San
Francisco to Sydney, N. S. W.. with a load
of wheat. While in the latter port the
cargo caught fire and considerable dam
age was done. A couple of week;, later
Captain Baxter's wife and children arrived
from Scotland, and that in a measure
compensated for the worry the captain
had Deen put to by the tire.
Captain Baxter is an artist of no mean
merit, and a handsome oil painting of the
Ross-shire made by him graces the cabin.
He is also a good musician and an enthu
siast over bicycling. The vessel only got
in a couple of days a_o, but the anchor
had not been dropped an hour before the
i captain had his "bike" ashore, and was on
â  his way to the consignees.
Tne British ship Lord Cairns, which ar
i rived from Swansea yesterday, made an
j unusually long run for her. "Just fancy,"
! said Captain Davies, "I was 161 days get
: ting here, and out of eighteen voyages I
have made to San Francisco before I was
never more than 130 days. Why, off the
Horn there were twenty-one days that we
never made a mile. It snowed, and it
hailed, and it blew, but it always blew in
the wrone direction. Then when we got
around into the Pacific, we had a succes
j sion of dead calms that lasted twenty-one
i days more, until at last I began to despair
of ever reaching port. 1 never had such a
time of it in all my life before, and don't
want a second similar experience." Cap
tain Davies has probably made more con
secutive runs to San Francisco than any
other master in port.
The flags along the water front yester
day were all at half mast out of respect to
the memory of Captain Frank J. Miller of
the brig Lurline. He was taken ill with
pneumonia last week and diea quite sud
denly. Captain Miller was one of the
most highly esteemed masters on the
wator front, and his death cast a gloom
; over shipping circles. This was to have
been his last voyage. In fact he wanted
to retire last month, but the owners of the
j Lurline persuaded him to make one more
trip. Years ago he was master of tbe
bark Annie Johnson, then he had the
schooner Hera and for years was on the
, brigantine Courtney Ford. He had been
I a master for twenty-live years, and his
! last illness was the only one that confined
him to the house for any length of time.
The steerage passengers iroin Canada on
the steamer Umatilla had good cause to
growl at the immigration officers yester
day. The vessel got in from Fuget Sound
ports at 10 a. m. and three hours later the
steerage immigrants were still aboard
waiting for some one to pass on their
cases.
On June 17 last the British ship Dun
donald, from San Francisco for Hull, was
run down by the British steamer Santar
euse in latitude 15 degrees north, longi
tude 33 degrees west. The Dundonald
reached Hull with nearly all her cargo of
wheat. A short cable to the Merchants'
Exchange gave the news, but full particu
lars did not reach this City until yester
day. In a private letter the writer says:
"You have no doubt heard of the collision.
It was an awful affair, and tbe only thing
that saved us was the water-tight bulk
head. Had it given way all would have
gone to Davy Jones' locker. Our whole
bows were stove in, bowsprit all knocked
over to port, foretopmast gone a little
above the cap, main topgallant royal and
skysail mast and the crane of the fore
lower topsail yard carried away.
"I can tell you it was a complete wreck.
All our jibs and foretopmast staysails were
dragging alongside for days. After we
were struck our forepeak filled and we all
thought she was going down. Captain
Girvin ordered the starboard lifeboat
cleared away as the port side up to the
masts was in the water. We were in the
northeast trades, close hauled on the star
board tack and making not more than
four knots. The steamer was going twelve
and a half knots, so you can imagine what
kind of a crack she gave us. Tne captain
cf the steamer signaled that his vessel
was sinking, so we took off ail the women
and children and afterward the crew. She
had forty-seven passengers and fifty-one
of a crew, and as the Dundonald carried
thirty men all told, you can imagine what
our decks looked like. Luckily a bark
bound for Para, whither the steamer was
going, hove in sight and took all the pas
sengers off our hands. We also sent the
chief cook, steward and third mate. A
few provisions were got out of the steamer
by the bark and we got a few tons of coal.
Then we all stood on deck and watched
her go down. After that we got under
way with our forepeak full of water and
masts and sails hanging ovur the side and
made fair progress.
"We had seventy-seven hands aboard,
and the provisions soon began to give out.
The last fortnight oi the voyage we had to
burn wheat for fuel, and ali we had to eat
was porridge made from wheat we ground
up. It was lucky for us we had a load of
your California product, or else we would
have fared badly. When we arrived in
Liverpool the Santareuse's crew landed and
our ship was towed to Hull, where we are
waiting for a court of inquiry."
Since the above was written a telegram
has been received bere stating that the
captain of the Dundonald was exonerated
from all blame and tne captain of the
steamer was censured.
The Naval Reserve is going to Stockton
in a body. The Camanche's launch will
tow up the captain's gig. and the boats
Mayflower and Boston will be towed up
by the Millie. A great many excursion
ists went up on the J. D. Peters and Mary
Uarratt last night, but the center of at
traction was W. H. Thornley and his
Alaskan bear. It is to be presented to San
Francisco Parlor and will march at the
head of that bo iy in the para>ie.

LETTER-CARRIERS' CASH,
It Has Accrued for Extra Work
and Must Now Be Paid
in Full.
Commissioner Lorenz Is Here to
Settle the Claims of Three
Hundred Persons.
Henry L. Lorenz of Washineton. D. C,
Commissioner of the United States Court
of Claims, is at the Ramona. He has
come here to settle the claims of nearly
300 letter-carriers for overtime work. This
work has been done in past years, dating
in some instances, as far back as 1888.
In that year Sunset Cox succeeded in
passing a bill through Congress, paying
all carriers for work done over the regula
tion eight hours. Some of the carriers had
been put by the postmasters at clerical
work and others at sorting mail. Their
I pay has ramred usually from $Â»>OO to $1000
a year, and by Mr. Cox's bill they are to
be allowed proportionate pay for the extra
work.
Mr. Lorenz has been adjusting such
claims for about three years, and has paid
out about $2,000,000. He has traveled in
California, Oregon, Washington, Colorado,
Utah, Kansas, Nebraska, lowa and other
States. On this visit he is accompanied
by Clark McKercher, an attorney of Wash
ington, D. C, who represents a legal firm
having the cases of about 250 of the claim
ants.
Of the 300 claimants in San Francisco
for overtime work 260 have already filed
their claims with Commissioner Lorenz.
The Commissioner's home was formerly
in Toledo, Ohio, where for several years
he was a Judge. Inspector J. W. Erwin of
the Postoffice Department is an old-time
friend of Mr. Lorenz.
Mr. Lorenz will be here probably for
several days.
T * m
SPORT FOR THE CARNIVAL.
Wrestling Matches on the Night of the
Columbia Club Benefit.
Vincent White, instructor of the Colum
bia Athletic Club, has issued a challenge
to Al Lean, instructor of the Reliance
Athletic Club, for a wrestling watch, best
three out of five, to take place on the
night of the benefit given by the Columbia
Athletic Club.
Up to Sunday night it was supposed
that the match had been definitely ar
ranged, bnt yesterday word was received
from A I Lean that he could not wrestle.
_ White is now out with a defi to wrestle
Lean any style chosen, for a trophy or
a purse, as Lean might elect, and the same
to be. pulled off on the night of the Co
lumbia benefit for the Golden Gate carni
val.
In addition to the wrestling match,
which will probably be arranged in the
meanwhile, an interesting six or eight
round go between two noted amateurs is on
the tapis.
Colonel John O' Byrne is preparing a list
of collectors to visit the business houses
immediately. It was thought at first to
defer any attempt to collect money until
after the election, but Colonel O'Byrne
has decided to start at once in order that
there may be no excuse on behalf of ; the
merchants for not subscribing liberally, as
they know, that the affair will be brought
off according to agreement on April 19.

"THE ANNOUNCEMENT TO THE SHEPHERDS."
streets is to have a beautiful pictorial
window in the southern transept, where
one of the temporary plain windows is to
be replaced by the "Announcement to the
Shepherds." And this artistic contribu
tion to the handsome Norman church is
only the first of many of its kind. So
that in a very short time the whole
interior aspect of Trinity will iiave been
changed by the introduction of stained
glass windows, the gift of various mem
bers of the congregation.
The grand window for the transept is
now ready to be set in place, and will be
erected immediately. It is the gift of Mr.
8. lams, an old member of Trinity
Chuich, who has intended it as a
memorial window in remi-mbrance of his
wife, Mrs. Carolina L.. Tarns, who died De
cember 20, 1891. Mrs. Tarns was one of the
best known ladies of San Francisco, and
the tirst American woman born in Cali
fornia. The many friends 3heleft behind,
particularly those in Trinity congregation,
are deeply interested in the memorial.
Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria.
Rev. Mr. Walk, pastor of the church, is
infatuated with it, and many ot his flock,
who have seen the window, are proud of
it as a work of art in Trinity Church.
The window â every incu of it â is of
home manufacture, both in the artists'
work aud the mechanical department,
having been designed and made by Thomas
C. Butterworth of this City. In dimen
sions it is five feet wide and twenty feet
six inches high. The glass is exclusively
of high-grade, antique quality and appa
rently handled with great care. Its gen
eral ensemble is, to say the least, striking,
and this includes the grouping, details,
drawing and color scheme, all of which
are highly spoken of by connoisseurs.
The window represents a scene framed
in pure Gothic lines of a golden hue. In
the foreground are the shepherds in an
attitude that shows they have just been
disturbed from their quiet avocation. One
shades his eyes from the brilliancy of an
approaching angel, while another leans on
his staff and listens to the wonderful
words of peace and good will. Their faces
are full of reverence, mixed with awe. All
about them are their flocks grazing peace
fully.
The angel appears as a beautiful woman,
soaring amid cherubs on the clouds and
pointing toward Bethlehem, which is seen
in shadows far off in the distance. And
there shines the star over the stable,
brighter and larger than those in the
spangled firmament. In the architectural
framing, among the exquisite tapering
finials nigher up, are two angelic figures
in Dostures of adoration.
The whole is pitched in a subdued key
of color, as the scene represents night, but
the herald angel is radiant with light and
loveliness, and this same light is reflected
upon the shepherds' faces.
Malicious Mischief.
John Buttler, a butcher at 233 Haight street,

into the meat hanging in front of his store.
Rickoft" is a respectable citizen and was very
indignant over his arrest. He denied the
charge. He gave cash bail and was released.

Collarbone Broken.

was leaning against the wall, fell and struck
him, breaking his right collarbone and bruis

Possible Reduction of Streetcar

IS THE BICYCLE BAGGAGE?
The Board Ignored by Other Com
panies and Will Appeal to the
Attorney-General.
Secretary Willcutt of the Market-street
Railway Company did not bring the cor
psration's books with him as requested
when he punctually appeared before the
Board of Railroad Commissioners yester
day afternoon, but he brought the com
pany's legal light, who very deliberately
told the Commissioners that he did not
think they had the jurisdiction to regu
late or reduce streetcar rates, and there
fore he would refuse on the part of the
secretary to produce any of the records of
what the car companies are making from
the 5-cent fares.
Then Attorney Walker dutifully took
Secretary Willcutt by the hand, and the
couple trotted as demurely and silently
from the ioom as two little Sunday-school
boys mindful of mamma's admonition to
deliver the message and come right back
home.
The Commissioners silently looked at
one another until Dr. Btanton broke the
threatening spell by declaring: "I regard
this refusal as contempt, and we should
punish it. We must take some action
in this matter; either begin the investiga
tion or punish Secretary Willcutt-" But
Chairman La Rue poured oil udoii the
troubled waters by suggesting that the
Attorney-General be asked for an opinion
on the matter of jurisdiction.
The proposition of a reduction in raies
originated with a request filed with the
board by the Ashbury Heights Improve
ment Club, w ich asked lor an investi
gation of the earnings of the Market-street
Railway Company and a 2% or 3 cent fare
if conditions should warrant.
During the meeting two other matters
were brought up for an opinion by the
Attorney-General. It seems that a ridicu
lously small percentage of the transporta
tion companies other than the steam rail
roads has complied with the Commis
sioners' request for reports. Then the
board would like to know if it has the
power to declare bicycles to be baggage.
The Attorney-General must settle these
questions.
The Commissioners instructed their sec
retary to request the Southern Pacific
Railroad Company to submit a report of
all the changes in the schedule of rates

"GIVE US WORK; MONEY WILL COME" SAYS LABOR.
It appears fortunate for some voters that time intervenes between the nomination
and election of a President. Otherwise some citizens might have been carried away
by a false current started by self-seeking politicians toward the shoals of ruinous free
trade. But time has been called "the friend of truth." Gradually the earnest voter
has crown to aistinguish between the siren-voice of treacherous Bryanism and the
calm, businesslike warning of great Republican leaders. All through the City men
are thinking, and the more they think the more they want protection. "Let us have
plenty of work," is the cry, "and the money question will regulate itself." There is a
widespread conviction that while Democratic success means new and untried experi
ments, the policy of the Republican party and the fidelity to party promises made by
the grand old organization insure thai with the election of William McKinley the
party will move onward to renewed prosperity and will retrieve the disasters incident
to Democratic misrule. The interviews published below are inspiriting because they
show that the people are sound and wide awake and cannot be misled by plausible
sophistries. Some of those who will vote for McKiuley followed the Cleveland ban
ner, but they have seen their error and express regret that they were mistaken. One
of the speakers has been a life-long Democrat, who finds that Republicanism has al
ways meant prosperity and that Democratic rule means disaster. All see that tht
real issue of the campaign is protectioa to American industries.
PROSPERITY VERSUS DISASTER.
AUGUSTUS L. DE MARS, blacksmith, whose residence is at 81 Natoraa street,
said:
is no doubt in my mind that,
â  under the administration of McKinley
Htbe affairs of this country will be more
Biirosf.erous than they could be if Bryan
Hshould be in tbe Presidential chair. I
Hhave been a Democrat nearly all my days,
Hbut I have come to a full realization of the
I fact that when the Democrats have control
|of the National administration we nave
I Lad times. This iias been so from tbe
Hadmini^tration of Buchanan to the rule of
Hcieveland. The Republican party and the
Hpolicy of the Republican party are safer
Hfor this country. I approve heartily and
Hall the time of the policy of protection,
Hbut do not think well of the free trade idea
Hany of the time, free trade is surely not
Hcoocl for the wage-earners of the United
Hstates, and we have experimented far
Heiuv.iirh along that line to arrive at a
which every one can see.
Hi have voted for Democratic Presidential
Hcandidates. I voted for Oi rover Cleveland,
Hand I have realized that 1 made a mistake.
sir, speaking as a blacksmith and
after the fashion of a blacksmith, I may truly say that I burned a hole in my shirt
when I voted for Cleveland. I think that the Democratic party and the Democratic
policy have brought the hard times upon us through which we are passing. As the
Democrats propose to follow out the policy of free trade, letting in foreign made
goods to compete with our home products, there is no reason why times will be any
better than they are now with Bryan as President. Republican administrations have
brought prosperity. I have worked at a mechanical trade thiity-three years, thirty
three years as a blacksmith in fact. I have served as a soldier in the army in the Civil
War. A reasonably large acquaintance with workingmen qualifies me, more or less,
to speak with knowledge of the condition of labor. You know, and every one knows
that work is scarce, that wages have fallen and that they are still falling, and that
what we need is work, not theories of any sort. 1 said before that the Republican
policy is safer than the Democratic policy, and every workingman ought to see that
to be the fact."

been less work. Mills and factories have been shut down all over the country, for the
effect of encouraging foreign competition against our own industries is necessarily
and naturally widespread. Times are bad in California, but they are as bad and
probably worse in other sections ot the country." Mr. Dennis has worked many
years as a machinist in this City. He lives at 1622 Polk street.
who has been a machinist thirty-five years and who was foreman
for the Southern Pacific Company for
â  twelve years, is engaged in mechanical
â  business on Main street. He lives at
â  3282 Seventeenth street "I will vote for
â  McKinley for President," he said. "There
â  are many reasons why I should vote for
â  him, and I would find it very difficult to
Blind a reason why I should vote against
â  him. Ido not see how any workman can
â  reasonably vote against McKinley. In
â  the first place, I can nee that better times
â  will come as the result of Republican sue
â  cess. My experience has taught me that
â  is so, and future experience will not prove
â anything different. We are all interested
l in the welfare of the country and in the
Hcondi'ion of the people at large. I have
â  been one of the fortunate ones in the mat
â  tiT of having steady work, but I have seen
â  many as good workmen as myself out of
â employment during the Cleveland ad*
â  ministration. When i was foreman for
â  the Southern Pacific Company out at
â  sixteenth street there was hardly a day
â  passed without some good mechanic ap
â  plied for work. I have seen the time in
when it was necessary to take
I the train and come down to San Francisco to hire mechanics, and then they could
|not be hired. Iso such thing has happened since the Democrats have secured con
trol of the National administration. This also occurs to me. There are questions
about the result of Democratic experiments, but the mechanics have no fear of the
Republican party. I have been in a position to become acquainted with and to
thoroughly understand many mechanics, and 1 Know how they feel concerning the
protective tariff. They are well read, as they have to be to keep up, and they under
stand the political situation aboui as well as any one can explain it to them. If the
Democrats have any money to spend for political use I would advise them not to
spend it trying to convince the mechanics to vote against McKinley, for that means
throwing both time and money away. It will not j?o."
HENRY A. McINTIRE, who has been a machinist twenty-two years, came at one*
to the point when he was asked why hcp^p^p^p^p^p^p^p^p^p^p^p^p^p^p^p^p^p^p^p^p^p^pj
is going to vote for McKinley. "Last timel
I voted the Democratic ticket for Presi-H
dent. I had an idea that the Democrats!
could give us a better share of prosperity ;l
more work by building up the foreignM
markets for American manufactures; bet-H
ter wages resulting from a greater demandM
for labor. I cannot see how the policy orH
the application of the policy of the Derao-H
crats has helped us. We are worse off in-l
stead of having our condition improved, I
and in this 1 and many thousands of I
others have undoubtedly been disap-H
pointed in our expectations. No one has|
been helped who works for wages. No|
one who works for wages is going to be|
helped by Democratic success. It is en- 1
tirely fair to reason that way in view of I
that which has, we know, already hap- 1
pened and is now happening?. I think I
that we want protection. That is the I
first and real issue of this campaign, the I
main thing, in fact. No workingrnan can I
successfully dispute the statement that I
protection ought to and must benefit him. I
Where will he look for protection ? Will he find protection taught by the Democratic
party, either the silver or the gold wing of the Democracy, or by Bryan himself? Not
much. The only party that advances protection as its political cardinal doctrine is
the Republican party. To abandon protection for the 16 to 1 doctrine, which could
not, at the best, lead to more than two or three years of increased activity in mining
and an increased demand for mining machinery for perhaps less time, would prove to
be a serious mistake. There is no doubt about that. If workmen are paid in 50-cent
silver dollars on the Pacific Coast that would offset any increased demand for labor in
the mines and lor the work of machinists in the making of mining machinerv during
the very short period which I have indicated. Let every workingman and every
mechanic vote for his own best good, which is for protection for his labor "
LOOKING FOR BETTER TIMES.
W. I. STONE is a well-known macfaini a t in this City. He resides at 1531 Chestnut
street, Alameda. He said yesterday : 'I
I am going to vote for McKinley. His elec-
I tion will mean that workingrnen will see
I better times. I have worked as a machin-
I ist twenty years. lam fully satisfied that
I protection is better than free trade for me
I in every way. There can never be higher
I wages by reason of free trade. To put it in
I a nutshell, the fact can be briefly and
I truly stated in this way: No protection,
I no higher wages. Wages cannot be raised
I by introducing foreign competition with
I our laborers and mechanics. Yet, that is
I precisely what free trade does. If we
I have protection, then the money question
I will regulate itself. Money will be suf-
I ficiently plenty for all the demands of
H trade and business whenever proper meas-
I ures are taken to provide more work.
I There is a radical difference between pro-
I viding more work and providing to ft
I along with less work. First of all, we
I want to get work, and with enough de-
I mand for labor, skilled and unskilled,
I wages will rise, and every worker can see
I that this is ttie essential thing. The Re-
for labor and better wages. The last
four years furnish a melancholy example of what we may expect from the Democratic
party. The iron trade has eons down in four years. Wages have fallen. I have been
working in the Iron business continually for twenty-three years. What I have seen
of one Democratic Administration an da Dart of another has been enough for me. The
object lesson ought to be enough to convince every wage-earner which way his inter
est lies politically. If he cannot take a lesson from the conditions as th*y now exist,
and as they have been since the Democrats came into power, I can not imagine what
could be brouzht forward that could convince. It hss been a lesson that should appeal
in the most powerful way possible, because it is an appeal to the self-interest of every
roter who wants to do as well as possible. If there is any one who wants lower wages
or lees work, I have not found him."
"Why am I going to vote for Me Kinley?" inquired C. R. Ny, employed as ma
chinist at the California Saw ' Works.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^H^^^^^^^^H
"Well, for a good many reasons, and il

â quite youthful in appearance, and is of
â tbo opinion that the planing-roill industry
â  has been stunted by the policy of the

"It was about three years ago, only a
â short time after the Democrats took the

conditions are lack of protection and the lack of confidence in the Democratic
administration, "^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^h

"What men need is work," said Chris Krumbeck, a teamster for Miller & Ham*

"I am a Republican and have been one
for thirty years. I have found it the party
of prosperity â the poor man's friend.
Democracy may be all right for the rich
man, but for the laborer it is a good party
to avoid affiliation with.
"Now, this question of finance is made
only to hide the real issue â protection â
for with protection comes prosperity. The
Democrats have had their President for
four years. They lauded him when he
went in, they praised his methods of
handling the different questions that arose
for a time and then came an ominous
silence. It was the lull before the storm.
Since then they have been execrating him
and yet he has only followed out hia
party's policy.

"The root of the money stringency and all the rest of the crying evils of the day
is lack of confidence. The Democracy is responsible for all this. Serenity and work
for laboring men will come only under a Republican President. We must have him."
FREE SILVER PREMATURE.
"All this free-silver talk Is nothing but rubbish." Thus briefly did John Ham mar,
a coppersmith employed by Sanders & Co.,^H^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^H
express his views of the question given sol
much prominence by the silver wing ofl
the Democracy.
"Who eve- heard of any talk of freeH

''The Democrats, however, secure the

masses is in favor of McKinley. Not because it is McKinley, but because he is re

PROSPEROUS UNDER PROTECTION.
WILLIAM GIMBELL, who is well known, said: "Yes, sir, I have been in thq
1^ of Dodge, Sveeney & Co. for six
â  teen years. I have read and thought a
â j:reat deal over this silver question and
â  protection and have come to this dcci
â  sion, that should this country have free
â  silver my employers could not increase my
â  wages ana I would have to pay much more
â  for the necessities of my family. That
â  settles that. Now, I am satisfied that
â  America was always prosperous under her
â  protective system, so I shall vote for Me-
BKinley, who believes m protection. Say,

H 'corker' for protection, and the more you
I publish it the more votes you will make.

the tariff system the United States." â¢" -
ment."
"Why am I in favor of McKinleyâbe
cause I am a firm believer in protection,"
he said. "The Socialists are in all proba
bility going to fail in putting up a ticket
in California this year, and as between
the Democratic and Republican parties I
am very much in favor of the latter.
"The Democrats have never given us
anything in the way of good government.
Take all the notable reforms and you can
trace them back to a RetraDiican adminis
tration.
"Protection is what we need. Only
protection can bring business back to its
former condition of prosperity. Free
trade is the most ruinous policy ever
tried. They say we have never had free
trade. It is true â we never have. .But
the nearest we have come to it has been
under a Democratic administration, and
the nearest we ever approached bank
ruptcy was under the same regime.NOW PREPARED
FOR PASSENGERS
Coaches of the Valley-
Road Have Arrived
at Stockton.
WAITING FOR FRESNO.
Passenger Traffic to Be Deferred
Till the Trouble There
Is Settled.
NEW CLASS RATES ISSUED.
The Southern Pacific Company Puts
. Out Its Latest R duced
Tariff.
Everything i 3 now in readiness to begin
passenger traffic on the Valley road, but
this branch of railroading will not be in
augurated, so it is stated by one of the
prominent officials of the road, until en
trance is secured on reasonable conditions
to the terminal property of the company
in the town of Fresno.
otiaiions to this end have been in
progress lor several weeks and at one time
promised to be concluded in short order.
The prospects are now not so good, owing
to a few obdurate property-holders along
the line of the railroad' 9 right of way on
Diana and Q streets. Tbe3e are making
exorbitant claims for alleged damage that
would result to their holdings by reason
of the railroad passing by them.
The rolling-stock for the accommoda
tion of travelers has arrive I at Stockton,
end also cabooses for freight trains. There
are six na^senger coaches, two combina
tion baggage and smoking cars and eight
cabooses in the consignment. The pas
senger coaches are painted a bright yellow
anÂ«l their trimmings are of aluminum.
Although theSoutnern Pacific Company
has been quoting rates in the San Joaquin
Valley ever since the first ot September to
meet the class rates put in Ly the San
Francisco and San Joaquin Valley Rail
road Company, its schedules of the re
ouced rates were not ready for distribu
tion until yesterday. Those for points
north of Minturn have already been pub
lished, and herewith are tiven those for
Minium and points south as far as Fresno.
Both old and new rates are presented for
the purpose of showing clearly the reduc

These rates are about the same at those
put in by the Valley road, care having been
tfken by the Southern Pacific to make
those at competitive points of the Valley
road the same as are quoted by the latter.
An exception to this course, however, was
taken by the Southern Pacific Company
in quoting second, third and fourth class
rates. In each of these the Southern
Pacific rates are 2 cents per 100 pounds
higher.
Reductions it will be seen from the
foregoing tables have been made by the
Southern Pacific as far as Fresno, though
tue Valley road is operating, so far as
general traffic is concerned, only as far as
Lankership, the station that is in compe
tition with Madera, on the Southern
Pacific. This course was forced upon the
old corporation in order to have a proper
scale of rates between Madera and Fresno,
in view of the great reduction made at
Madera to meet the Valley road schedule.
As soon as the Valley road enters
Fresno, there will be an additional cut m
freight rates to tnat point.
MINISTERS TAKE A REST,
The Congregational Parsons Go
Into Retreat at the Sem
inary.
Presbyterians Discuss the Pros and
Cons for Baptizing All
Children.
There was a great dearth of the usual
ministerial meetings in this City yester
day, owing to various causes. The Con
gregational brethren were in retreat all
day at the Pacific Theological Seminary
in Oakland; several of the Methodist pas
tors assembled, but finding that the ma
jority of their brethren were already on
the wing for conference at Pacific Grove,
tiiey decided to hold no meeting, and the
Christian pastors met yesterday at Stiles
Hall, Berkeley, instead of in the office of
the Pacific Christian, their meeting place
hitherto.
The Presbyterian ministers devote the
f.rst Monday in the month to "quizzing,"
and yesterday four quiz questions were
propounded by Rev. F. A. Doane, who had
been appointed to set the questions going.
The greatest amount of discussion was
given to considering whether the rite of
baptism should or should not be given to
infants, when neither parent is a church
member nor a professing Christian.
Rev. Dr. Stewart, who Jed the discus
sion, was strongly in favor of giving the
rite of baptism, when asked for, to the
children of non-church members; he paid
the Script nres were rather ambiguous on
thÂ» Duint, though, in his belief, tl.ey gave
authority for a liberal featilng on the mat
ter. Rev. Dr. McÃr de took the opposite
stand. He said that according to the
Presbyterian confession of faith, only
children of members could be baptized.
Pastor Birch made a plea for giving chil
dren their rights. "In these days even
the law is beginning to recognize that
children have a standing of their own, and
have rights, whether the parents are will
ing to grant them their right or not.
Baptism is a privilege to wnich every
child has a right," and the pastor went on
to state that one of the chief reasons for
his having left the Baptist church and
joined the Presbyterian was on this very
point of infant baptism. He believpd the
Almighty to be the father of every child.
Rev. Dr. Mi n ton repudiated any idea of
personal option in the matter. "The
Vresbyterian churcli teaches that a child
must be born of church members in order
to be baptized. Baptism stands for some
thing which is inherited and I do not be
lieve in cheapening it."
The other quiz questions dealt with the
problem of whether individual cups or
common cups should be used for the
Lord's supper and whether the use of wine
or tobacco by tha minister lessens his in
fluence for good. The prevailing opinion
was that ministers should not smoke or
drink.

INFLUENCE OF WYOMING
The Way It Affected the
Suffrage Movement in
Colorado.
Address by Mrs. C. Chapman Catts, the
National Organizer â Grand Rally
Next Thursday Night.
At the meeting of the California Suffrage
Association, held yesterday afternoon in
Golden Gate Hall, there was a large at
tendance of ladies who had assembled to
listen to Mrs. Chapman Catts of New
York, the National organizer of the
Woman's Suffrage Association.
Mrs. Catts' address yesterday was on the
work done in Colorado and how it had
been influenced by the action of Wyoming
on t: c woman suffrage question. She
spoke of the early efforts of the woman
suffragists in Wyoming in 1870, and then
told of what was done twenty years later
and of the final triumph of the cause fol
lowed by the influence that triumph had
in the effort to obtain the enfranchisement
of women in Colorado. She then told of
the efforts of the English brewery syndi
cate of Denver, Colo., to defeat the move
| raent for woman suffrage, and when that
I became known it brought an unusual
number of friends to the woman's cause.
SLe declared that she felt that California
and Idaho would grant the right of fran
chise to women this fall, and that it hav
ing been granted, in 1902 every State and
Territory would place woman on the plane
I on which she is by right destined to stand.
Tnat accomplished, the women she said
would then be in a position to uplift hu
manity and make a better world. The
movement which is now going on in the
United States, she declared, would not
only benefit American women, but would
eventually benefit all the women of the
j world. She urj;ed upon all present to do
what they can lor the cause and they will
be rewarded by obtaining the right to vote
as fully as the men.
It was announced that Mrs. Catts will
speak on Thursday niehc in Metropolitan
Hall, when she will be introduced to a
lar_-e audience. She will also speak in
various parts of the State between now
I and November.
The Rev. Anna Shaw made a few re
marks eulogizing Mrs. Catts in her work,
and declared that when Miss Anthony
heard of Mrs. Catts' arrival she exclaimed :
"Ten thousand tons have been lifted off
my shoulders." The speaker spoke en
couragingly of the prospects for carrying
the amendment in this State and said that
advices from San Diego and Ukiah are all
right for woman suffrage in November.
Miss Sarah M. Severance made a few re
marKÃ, after which Mrs. Hay called upon
all to volunteer to talk to every man who
nas a vote to convert him to the woman
suffrage cause.
The meeting closed with a brief address
by Mrs. A. A. Sargent.

Holbrook-Blinn, yesterday, '-to beat any
thing . that the men have yet been able to
do in the way of a meeting; and we have
taken effective measures to make our open
me rally come up to our expectations."
: The Mission Suffrage Club will hold its

something like $1000 will have been ex
pended to make the celebration a aeclded
success.
The uniform adopted by the parlor will
be a light Fedora hat, light uegligee shirt,
blue necktie, yellow belt, dark trousers
and a parasol to keep off the hot sun.
Pacific Parlor will be very much in evi
dence at Stockton. The tiery cross has
been sent out, and there will be a mighty
gathering of the clansmen at new Pioneer
Hall, the headquarters of the parlor at
Stockton. To surve as a foil to the beauty
of the individual members of the parlor
Oro Fino Parior No. 9, N. D. G. W., will
accompany them. The young ladles of
that parlor, with rare taste, have arranged
to garb themselves in snowy white, which
is intended to be emblematical of the im
maculate purity and innocence of the
members of Pacific.
The parlor has arranged some floats that
will be a feature of the procession, and
that will not fail to attract attention.
Judge Groezinger will appear as the star
eyed Goddess ot Justice in a tableau in
which, with the traditional scales, he will
do his grand balancing act. C. Juridious
Haggerty and Marcellus Aurelius Dorn
will assist at holding the scales aloft. J.
Ancient Steinbach, who prides himself
upon being the first white child born in
captivity, and is looked up to as the oldest
Native Son. has consented to appear in the
float, "California as it was in the fall of '49
and spring of '50."
A. Aristophanes Borlini. the mascot of
Pacific Parlor, will be a feature of the pro
cesÃion. In the float "Cleopatra" he will
represent Egypt's ill-starred Queen. The
scene will be one of Oriental splendor and
grandeur.
W. Hyacinthe Hazell, F. Ãbiquitous
Neville, J. Exquisite Manning, H. Fas
tidious Dederky and J. Objector Kropp,
by special request of Oro Fino Parlor,
N. D. G. W., have been assigned to them
for duty.
J. Tarantula Greany and J. Kathode
Hawkins, by unanimous consent, have
been delegated to attend to the parlors'
canteen.
A committee of twenty-five has been ap
pointed to see that they do not overdo
their duties.
Judge B, Vernacular Costello, the Ches
terfield of the parlor, will be on hand with
his smile, but minus his whiskers. The
Judge is a great favorite wiih the ladies,
and at every 9th ol September celebration
makes numerous conquests. This year he
will have a lively opponent in the person
of F. Walkover bmith, whose consum
mate skill in the act oi doing the agreeable
is of more than local repute. To the hand
somest man of the parlor has been dele
gated the honor of leading Oro Fino and
Pacific in the parade, and the prouii and
manly bearing of Erasuxs Lycurgus Fos
ter, when waving aloft his gayly colored
baton, will be the most stricinc; feature in
the second division.
Next in importance and in the hearts of
Oro Pino Parlor is Daniel-in-the-llon'a-den
Fitzgerald, whose nora de guerre of
"Papa is one to conjure with, and whose
fatherly care of the girls is a noted char
acteristic. . - â¢
And there is Judge John A. Carroll,
whose pet name of "Marie" is reminiscent
of many a moonlight 'walk and visit to
the old fandango at San Luis Obispo.
John J. Dunn Jr., manager of the chorus
in "Sinhad the Sailor," otherwise known
as the "Boy Orator of the Flat," is to act
as assistant to the worthy marshal at the
banquet to be held at the Pacific's head
quarters on the evening of the Bth. The
'boy orator" is to respond to the toast of
the "Spellbinders."
"Carmencita" Cunningham, Pacific's
worthy president, has volunteered to pilot
the members in Stockton to "Shrine 106."
On the whole, Pacific has made extensive
arrangements to entertain ail its friends
and guests at its headquarters.
The following official order has been
issued:
The line of march will be down Mason street
to Market and along Market street to the ferry.

Grizzly Parlor No. 1, Junior N. S. G.
W., has decided to parade in Stockton on
the 9th. At tne meeting last evening the
following uniform was adopted: AV bite
golf caps with large yellow button, dark
coat, white duck trousers, tan shoes and
leather belt. This is the first attempt to
raise a junior parlor, and it has a large
number of members. It is the baby par
lor, as it has only been organized three
weeks. _______________

The Occupants, Mr. and Mrs.

Called for Police.
LIVELY CHASE AND CAPTURE.
The Burglar Is a Sailor Who Arrived
Here Last June ia the Ship
Doon.
The fire-escape climber has apparently
taken the place of the porch-climber, as
several burglaries have recently been com
mitted in hotels, the mode of entrance to
the rooms being by the fire-escape.
F. Thurgur, a sailor, between 3 and 4
o'clock yesterday morning, while passing
the Bella Vista Hotel, Taylor and Pine
streets, saw a window open on the second
story on the Taylor-street side, next the
fire-escape. The temptation was too
strong to be resisted and Thureur climbed
up the water-pipe to the first story and I
got on to the fire-escape. He soon reached
the open window and was entering the
room when the occupants, Mr. and Mrs.
John Gillig, awoke.
Mrs. Gillig screamed and Mr. Gillig
jumped out of bed and shouted for the j
police. Thurgur did not show tight, but |
got out of the window as quickly as possi- j
ble, slid down the fire-escape and dropped j
to the sidewalk. Mr. Gillig followed him j
as far as the bottom of the fire-escape, but
did not care to take the jump in his bare
leet. and as the night air was cold he re
treated to his room.
Policeman Eueene R. Wall happened to
be walking along Pine street near Taylor
and heard Gillig's cries for the police. He
*:ot to the corner in time to see Thurgur
drop to the sidewalk from the fire-escape.
Wall called upon Thurgur to stop, but the
sailor paid no attention to him and ran
toward Bush street. Wall pursued him ]
and fired two shots at the ground as he ran !
to intimidate Thurgur, but they only
made him increase his speed.
As Thurgur turned the corner of Bush
street Wall took aim at him but missed
him. Thurgur began to think it was get
ting too uncomfortable for him and he
jumped over the gate leading to the Den
man Grammar School aad crouched
among the trees. Wall climbed over the j
sate after him and soon caught him in his
hiding place. Thurgur offered no resist
ance.
Wall took him to the City Prison and
booked him on the charge of burglary. !
When searched a silver dollar and two j
nickels were the only things found in his
pockew. -
Thurgur came here last June on the
ship Doon, from the Clyde, Scotland. "I
left the ship," he said, "on her arrival,
"and since then have been trying to get
work along the water front, but was not
very successful.
4 I am a native of Edinburgh, 31 years
of age, and have been fourteen years at
sea, the first ten in the British navy. A
sailor's life on a merchantman is not a
pleasant one, and I got tired of it. lam
a married man and have a wife and fam
ily in Edinburgh.
"When I saw the open window I could
not resist the temptation to climb into the
room, as I was hard up in a strange town
without friends or any chance of getting
employment. I had no pistol with me
i ami no burglars' tools. As soon as the
man jumped out of bed I made my escape
through tne window, as I did not want to
â¢be caught. I will plead guiitv and throw
I myself upon the mercy of the court.
"No, I have not committed any other
burglaries by climbing the lire-escape or
any other way. This was my first at
tempt and I have been caught. As soon
as I get out I will go back to sea."
The police know nothing about Thurgur
and the probability is that he is telling
the truth.

Four Parlors to Participate In the
Great Demonstration at
Stockton.
OAKLAND, Cal,, Sept. 7.â This city is

tion at Stockton Wednesday by four uni

ROGERS MADE A
STRIDENT ROAR
Taxed Chairman Wardall
With Having Done
Him Up.
UNWILLING TO RESIGN.
Cator Engineered the Fusion and
Held the Whip Over the
Populists.
WAKDALL'S POLITICAL GRAFT.
He May Be Collector of the Port at
Wilmington â Dore for Post
master of Fresno.
J. Taylor Rogers, clerk of Mayor Sutro,
and nnbeloved of the octopus, was white
hot last Sunday night when he learned
that Chairman Wardall had announced
to the fusion conference committee that
he, Rogers, was witling to have his with
drawal acted upon if A. B. Kinne should
be made the nominee for Congress from
the Fifth District m his stead.
Mr. Rogers had sat in the anteroom of I
the silver headquarters all Sunday even
ing very disconsolate, awaiting the action
of the committee. According to the deal
that was made he Bhould have been ac- j
cepted as the fusion candidate, and would I
have been had lie not been betrayed by
those who should have been his political j
friends. But the octopus does many cruel 1
things, and this was not the first time that
friends have been made to cut the political \
throats of friends to serve the interests of j
that implacable corporation.
It was not until John W. Mitchell of '
Los Angeles emerged from the inner room j
and announced that A. B. Kinne, a mem- !
ber of the conference committee, had been
chosen in place of Mr. Rogers that the
victim realized the treachery that had un
done him.
When he inquired about it he learned |
that Chairman Wardall had made the j
announcement already mentioned. When
the People's party State Committee as
sembled in secret session at 4 o'clock yes- j
terday afternoon, Mr. Rogers was there j
with a very stern look on his face. When
the doors were closed and the transom was
shut down, so that the reporters who were
cooling their heels in the corridor could
not hear any of the acrimonious and dis
cordant strains issuing from within, Mr.
Rogers taxed Chairman Wardall with
having uttered the thing that was not.
"I never told you that I would wilh

draw in favor of Mr. Kinne," said Mr.
Rogers. "I never told you anything of tne
kind."
"Didn't you?" inquired the chairman,
with a bewildered air.
"No, I didn't," said Mr. Rogers.
'â¢Well, somebody told me bo," was the
chairman's explanation.
Then George W. Monteith, the regularly
nominated People's party candidate for
Congress from the First District, ad
dressed the committee, and offered to j
withdraw absolutely from the contest if
the committee would replace Mr. Rogers
on the ticket as the Populist candidate
from the Fifth District.
To Doth his and Mr. Rogers' surprise
the offer was rejected with but scant cour
tesy. Mr. Cator did not think favorably
of me proposition, and as the committee, â 
and in fact the whole party, have been in j
the habit of sitting at Mr. Cator's feet |
drinking in the words of wisdom that fell 1
from his lips, what Mr. Cator thought was I
a go and what Mr. Cator didn't think was I
no go. As Mr. Cator didn't think that it 1
would be expedient to reopen the whole
fusitm matter of course it didn't go.
Cator is reported to have been in charge
oi the People's party programme at ttie
State Convention in Sacramento, at the
National Convention in St. Louis where
he ably assisted the Democrats in whoop
ing up the Populists for Bryan, and dur
ing all the proceedings which terminated
last Sunday night in discord and no fu
sion.
Another prominent member of the com
mittee is John S. Dore, who is said to be
the most popular People's party man in
the San Joaquin Valley and whose word
is law to the Populists of Fresno County.
His friends declare that virtue snail have
us reward, and that he must be the next
postmaster of the city of Fresno.
Chairman Wardall's friends are demand
ing for him the anpointiai'Dt as Collector
of the Port"at;Wilmington. Not just now, j
01 course, becaustj Mr. Wardall is in no
borrr, but if Willuun J. Bryan Le elected,
which, after all, may be a ve*v long wait !
even for a man as patieDt as is Mr. War
dall.
After these little matters had been die- '
posed of the committee discussed the fu
sion report. It was evident that every
thing was harmonious and satisfactory,
for the discussion occupied only two hours
and a half.
The report was adopted by a majority
vote, after which some one moved that the
vote should be made unanimous, which
was done.
Then they walked forth into the night
with joy and harmony and that peace
which passeth all understanding rankling
in their bosoms.
Mr. Monteith declares that he will re
main in the field. He has been nominated
regularly by a regular party convention,
and his place has never become vacant. For
that reason the Secretary of State will be
obliged to put his name on the ticket.
Mr. Monteith said to a Call reporier last
nisrht that the scheme for Congressional
fusion was a crafty plan of the octopus.
"The so-called fusion has enabled the
Southern Pacific Company to win five out
of seven Congressional districts," he
added, "if that scheme can succeed. As
between the Republican candidate. Mr.
Barham, and myself, the octopus had no
choice, for it cannot dictate to either of us,
and iv that district it became necessary to
find S' me one upon whom they could cen
ter their forces. They dared not put up a
pronounced railroad man, and so tney
adopted the pian of taking up a man
whose position upon that matter was not
known to the public.
"In the Second District the octopus was
interested in defeating the force arrayed
against Grove L. Johnson in order that he
might be returned to Congress. In the
Third District it was necessary to find
someone to defeat Hilborn, one who could
be depended upon to give that company
what they call 'fair treatment.' Vann was
a man of too much strength of character
to taKe any chances on. In the Fifth Dis
trict the advent of Taylor Rogers awak
ened the railroad's keenest apprehensions
and he was removed for some one less ob
jectionable.
"Having fixed *these districts to their
liking, they were enabled to devote all
their attention to the Fourth, where they
expect to defeat Judge Maguire at the
polls. The Populists on the committee
were very deftly made the catspaws of the
octopus in the fulfillment of its desires.
"Thus in the Fifth District they beat
Rogers on the ground that he was an
A. P. A. Then they beat Barry on the
ground that he was opposed to tne A. P. A.,
and then capped the climax by nomina
ting an A. P. A. in Rogers' place. This
showed conclusively that that question
cut no figure in the calculations at all.
Mr. Rogers is not an A. P. A., for he with
drew from that order some time ago. On
top of that the railroad people knew that
the election of Rogers, in view of the fact
that be was Mayor Sutro's clerk, would be
a hard thing to explain when they should
try to pass the funding bill next winter.
"I still stood by the proposition that I
made, and that is if they replace Mr.
Rogers on the ticket they can have my
resignation in five minutes.
"The fact of the matter is that the Poo
ulists have gotten the skim milk and the
railroad, as usual, has taken all the cream,
and l am not sure that they won't get a
good share of theskini milk too."
Some unkind criticisms have been made
against George W. Baker of the Bimetallic
League because he sat in the inner room
within earshot of the delegations of the
fusion conference committee last Saturday
nifjht. As a fitting and dignined rebuke
to those wicked criticisms Mr. Baker sat
out in the ante-room with Bob McKilli
can. Marshal Barry Baldwin and the rest
of the boys on Sunday night and did not
allow his presence to give rise to any sus
picion tnat he desired to influence or in
timidate the committee in any way.
Fell and Broke Her Noae.
Mrs. Mary Doyle, a stout old woman living at
327 Brannan street, paid a visit to some
fr ends at 2 Federal street last night. While
leaving aoout 9 o'ciock she missed her footing
at the top of the front steps, about fifteen in
number, ana fell to the bottom, striking unon
her face. Her nose was smashed into pulp
and was flattened on her face, while her fore
head was lacerated. She was taken to the Re
ceiving Hospital and l)r. Fitzgibboa attended
to her injuries.

Throngs Visit the Scene of Demolition
and Gaze on the Site of
House 9999.
Dr. Lovelace and Secretary Godchaux of
the Board of Health spent Sunday in the
malodorous atmosphere of Chinatown,
viewing the wreckage of the buildines
they had caused to be torn down, and in
cidentally taking observations with a view
to having other pestilential hovels con
demned.
It was intended that all the rookeries on
Dupont street, adjoining the old Globe
Hotel, should be razed yesterday morn
ing, but injunctions were served upon
j Secretary Godchaux, prohibiting the work
lof demolition on the houses numbered
1009, 1011 and 1013, owned by P. Marsi
cana. The injunction proceedings will be
i heard before Judge Murphy on the 14th
inst In the meantime, next Monday, the
injunction suits brought by Frank J. Sul
livan will be heard in the United States
courts, where it is probable the disagree
ment between landlords and the Board of
Health will be adjusted.
The different shanties torn down yester
day were previously photographed by R.
J. Waters, under instructions from Dr.
Lovelace, who wishes the camera's evi
dence as to how the places looked should
damage suits incur. These pictures, no
matter how perfect, will never carry to a
jury a correct understanding or apprecia
tion of the nuisances that are bein â¢â¢
abated, for that pungent, putrid ana pes
tiferous stench everywhere surrounding
the dirty dens, although thickÂ«enough as
it were to be cut with a knife, can hardly
be photographed.
The earJy morning's work was in Brook
lyn alley, where some shanties were torn
down last Saturday. The fire laddies, who
are sworn in as Deputy Health Inspectors,
oent their backs and their energies as well
as plied their axes to demolishing the den
owned by B. Brignoli. The place looked
like a woodyard, in the center of which
house 10 was located. It almost, seemed a
Pity to tear the thing down. Surely it
looked as if the old ramshackle affair
would fall by itself if left alone.
The house was u?ed as a lodging for
Chinese fishermen, scores of them finding
bunkroom in a space hardly ample for
only two. But, the building "being razed
i the underground labyrinths were uncov
ered, showing where, in dirty, dingy
passageways, reeking with filth, and with
absolutely no sewerage, bunks for forty
individuals were provided.
About 11 o'clock yesterday morning
Sergeant Holmes was notified that there
was something in the nature of a riot go
ing on iii Chinatown. He sent his men to
the scene, and found five score or more
little urchins demolishing the houses
numbered 708 to 714 inclusive, on Pacific
street. The little fellows were after fire
wood, and the Board of Health sign being
on the premises they believed themselves
at liberty to tear the places down at their
leisure. These condemned pieces be
longed to one Wilson, who is away, and he
has not yet been served legally with a
notification to vacate. But his tenants
were so notified. Still Wilson's agent here
threatens lawsuits galore.
While the work of destruction was
going on the health inspectors dropped
into the basement at 705 Pacific street. It
is a second-hand shop and junkstore in
which a half-dozen Chinese urchins work.
There is an onen sewer running through
this cellar, capable of diffusing every
known species of disease. This foul reser
voir is the receptacle for much of the filth
of the entire block. The inspectors will
recommend the condemnation of the
place.
The old landmark where stood the house
numbered "9999," near Stockton street on
Pacific, was visited by hundreds of people
and curiosity-seekers yesterday and Sun
day. There is nothing left now of that
historical building but a few broken
boards.
Milk Inspector J. P. Dockery and Ben
Davis, who have been two of the hardest
workers during these Chinatown raids,
ceased their labors yesterday afternoon to
join the Native Sons in their trip to
Stockton.
LOST HIS FURNITURE.
Why Henry Berkemer Suei the Pacific
Coast Steamship Company in the
Justices' Court.
Those who lost their goods and chattels
by the wrecking of the Pacific Coast
Steamship Company's vessel St. Paul at
Monterey on August 6 are beginning to
take legal measures against the company.
The first suit for goods lost in the wreck
was filed in the Justices' Court yesterday
by Henry Berkemer, who alleges that he
shipped his household furniture from
Port Harford via the St. Paul for San
Francisco, and that by the carelessness
and negligence of the servants of the com
pany he was deprived of it to ois damage
in;the extent of $299.
A BABY AS A PLEDGE,
Florie Royce, a Vaudeville Ac

Her Little G rl Is Held by a Board

Bill.
Mrs. Sam Snapper, known in the ranks
of the vaudeville as Florie Royce, went be
fore Judge Hebbard yesterday with her
attorney, Carroll Cook, to secure a writ of
alternative mandamus to compel Clorindo
Valento to give up the possession of her
(Mrs. Snapper's) child.
The trouble is all over a board bill
which Mrs. Valento claims to be due her
on behalf of the child, and she is holding
the child as security for its payment, very
much to the disgust of Mrs. Snapper.
Florie Royce is a high kicker by profei
sion. She placed her little daughter witn
Mrs. Valento, who resides on Rausch
street, to be properly cared for. Some
days ago the mother called with the inten
tion of taking the child away. She was
presented with a board bill for $24, which
she declared was much more than she
owed under her agreement and refused to
pay it.
Mrs. Valento sa ; .d she could not have
the child without paying the bill. The
mother went away to see legal counsel
and the result was the petition, wnich was
issued by Judge Hebbard. The parties
waited in court for some time for the ap
pearance of the defendant and finally an
attachment was issued.
DR. EASTO N'S RETURN.
Principally Dae to a Desire to Visit
His Son.
Dr. Chalmers Easton, the eloquent di
vine who was the friend and the
moral support of Sydney Bell dur
ing the two years he stood trial
and imprisonment for the murder of
young Jacobson, is again a resident of
this City, and Sunday assumed charge
of the pulpit of the Trinity Presbyterian
Church at Capp and Twenty-third streets.
"I hnve not come here in the interests
of Sydney Bell," stated the reverend gen
tleman last evening, "althougn I am still
convinced the young man was hastily
judged and condemned. My return to
this City is principally due to the fact that
my son is here, a pupil of the University
of California, and 1 desired to spend a few
weeks with him. An opportunity pre
sented itself when Dr. Smith desired to go
East, and we simply changed from one
end of the continent to the other. He has
taken up my duties in the East, I have
taken up his in the West."

The relative merits and efficiency of
Paine's celery compound in making peo-
ple well is clearly shown in the character
of the people who to-day rely on it to cure
insomnia, nervous debility, persistent
headaches and a rundown condition.
It is the power of rapid repair of the tis-
sues that makes Paine's celery compound
the great saver of life that it is. It brings
just the needed nutriment to the distracted
nerve tissues all over the body and in-
creases the volume of healthy blood so
that a breaking down of some vital part is
averted. While taking Paine's celery com-
pound these is a general building up of the
deep-lying tissues all over the body, and a
throwing off of unsound elements that
clog and interfere with its healthy activity.
The story of the discovery and unpar"
alleled success of Paine's celery compound
is the story of a high purpose steadfastly
followed; the reward for the life-long
study of the nervous system in health and
disease. Prof. Edward E. Phelps' discov-
ery In the laboratory of the Dartmouth
Medical School proved a monumental
work in the art of dealing successfully with
many diseases that were up to that time
held to be obstinate of cure. To-day
rheumatism and neuralgia, heart palpita*
tion and nervous dyspepsia are taken in
hand Dy Paine's celery compound with the
absolute assurance ol freeing the system
of them entirely.
In this greatest of all remedies there ia
hope for every person distressed by symp-
toms of dyspepsia, impure blood, failing
vigor or low nervous condition.

It is now generally understood nruong J
the masses that the free-coinage question j
â¢was formulated by the Democrats as a j
false issue. By throwing dust in tte eyes
of the people and holding up the counter
feit presentment they hope to gain votes,
for they know full well that they would
not have received many on the record of
President Cleveland as expressed in the
Wilson bill.
Not only do tbe Democrats of the entire
country feel ashamed of the record of their
party on the tariff issue, but all classes
know that their policy of ruin has com
pletely prostrated the manifold industries
of the country.
The New York Sun, generally conceded
to be the ablest Democratic paper in the
United States, recently put the case of
protection as against free trade quite
plainly as it applies to the workingmen.
It said:
"There is only one country in Europe in
which the wages of labor are within a half
of what they are in this countrj'. That is i
Great Britain. Wages in Germany,
France, Belgium and Switzerland are not
one-third of what they are here. Those of
Italy are not one-quarter. Last year cheap
foreign labor was imported into the United
States in the shape of manufactured
goods to the value of $692,319,768. Tiis
was a great wrong to American labor. In
the immense amount of imports permitted
by our insufficient and detective tariff the
labor of women employed in the Manches
ter < England) cotton-mills, v.hooe wages
Jo not average $tX) a year, came into com
petition wltb tho higher priced labor of
our Southern ana Northern cotton-spin
ners.

Orsrap. ized iabor, in its magnificent I
strength, held sway last evening in Metro
politan Temple. Men, hardy men, arti
sans, their wives, sisters and sweethearts,
crowded the vast edifice and listened to
the words of ra^n and women who learned
of what they spoke in the workshops of this I
country.
Stretched across the stage, high above
the speakers, the American flag hung be
tween thÂ»- pennants oVmany labor organi
zations. In the center, between the de
vices of the respective unions, was a
plainer banner, silently extending to all a |
hearty ''Welcome by San Francisco Labor
Council on Labor Day, 1856." The I
medallion in the center of the banner read,
"Labor is King."
The silken banners most prominent on j
the stage ana over it were those of the j
Ironmolden, the Typographical, the |
Coopers', the Ci^armaters' and the Joui- <
iu-ymen Bakers' unions. Besides these !
emblems of this grand country and of the
most powerful and honorable associations
within it, little attempt was made at dec
oration. On the stage front a half score of
beautiful floral pieces awaited the ladies
who with song and recitation helped to
make the moments pass more pleasantly j
between the telling utterances of the j
speakers.
On the stage were: President, T. F. i
Burns; vice-president, J. Hill; secretaries,
Ed Rosenberg and Joseph Waiters; treas
urer, W. C. Ackerman; C. Shuppert, Miss
Anna Shaw, W. Mac Arthur and Thomas
Hurd.
Mr. Barns said it was his pleasant duty
to introduce the speakers and also to 1
briefly outline the objects of labor
unionism.
"Trades unionism," be continued, "is
organized to suppress vice and competi
tion among themselves. It is hard to con
vince the middleman that competition is
the life of trade when he comes into con
tact with the great, mammoth concerns â
combines that have for their object the
concentration of wealth and to crush out
all smaller rivals. No more can you tell
a workingman that competition Is the
best thing for him. The labor movement, j
in my opinion, represents the vanguard of j
the industrial democracy."
The chairman was warmly applauded, j
He introduced Mane Dobrin, who read a
poem, "The Judgment of Laboi," written
by Mies Gabriel M. C. Furlong, a member
of San Francisco Typographical Union
No. 21. The poem was dedicated to the
San .Francisco Labor Council. Its climax â
And in naming all thy glories, the dearest that we
bless.
The greatest, and the grandest, Is America's Free
Press-
Met the hearty approval of the house, and
the poem received an ovation.
Mrs. J. Morrissey contributed to the
pleasure of, the evening by singing ''Good
by, Summer." for which she was en
thusiastically applauded. In reply for an
encore she sang "My Little Sweetheart.
May."
J. J. Galvin, ex-president of San Fran
cisco Typographical Union No. 21, deliv
ered an address on "Children of the
Trade Unions." He said:
Mr. President, fellow trade unionists, la
dies and gentlemen: My appearance here this
evening I accept as a compliment to the trade

Trade for the man of business affairs, the Bar
Association for the reputable attorney, the
medical society for the pnysician who is not
too closely related to the undertaker and the
trade union for the mechanic and for the arti
san who are capable and who are self-respect
ing.
All of the organizations named are identical
as far as ethical obligations are 'concerned;
they differ only in that the trade-unionist is a
wage earner.
The underlying principles of trade unionism
are a fair day's wages for a lair day's work,
and the greatest good to the greatest number.
These . principles require no elaboration;
they arc. eternal as the billowy ocean, and
their fairness and justness are self-evident.
All capital conies from labor, and all labor
is performed by man. Hence, capital, labor
and man are a trinity which should work to
gether in harmony. As health is man's in
heritance from God, so is bis labor the only
means of preserving that health by enabling
him to make a livelihood.

last year! That which came from Bel*

"Italian labor, in Italian merchandise

â when the question is asked, "Who are the
trade-unionists, and what of their achieve
ments?" the answer comes:
From the shop and the factory and the
office; from the forge and the bench and the
railroad train; from the foundries and the
ironworks, and from that huge fortress of pro
tection and engine of destruction known as the
battle-ship.
From pillar and column and nave; from

answer come: "We are thy handiwork, O
children of the trade unions."

grauder, more enduring or more useful? And
their builders are the honest sons of toil who
protect the dignity of their callings through
their membership in the trade unions.
But there are others to be heard from. What
of tne stout-hearted seamen? Over the realm
of the storm-tossed sea, where tiod is still
supreme, but where the elements are raging
in tneir anger, from the disabled vessel comes
the cry of the sailor man, "We will stand by
our good ship till the last precious life is saved
â till the last precious life is saved."
And the musicians 1 What maybe said of
sweet music? It can only tell its own story.
It is melody; it is harmony. It is of earth,
yet is belonging to heaven. The prelude
of the orchestra; the chimes of the ves

band; the mazy waltz; the serenade
of the moonlight; the reveille of the
soldier; the ballad; the grand opera: the
sacred oratorio, and "Home, Sweet Home."

who follow the trade of the great Benjamin
Franklin, the revered Horace Greeley and of
our own brave townsman, James H.Barry;
and among whom are to be found many of the
brightest journalists living under our starry
flag? Those earnest men and women, who
toll through the weary hours of the night that
the world may be enlightened when the sun
light greets the mornâ what of them? From
the East and the West, and the North and the
South, centering round about New York, and
there, from the office of the New York Journal
to its sister, the Examiner, flashes the message:
"The members of the International Typo
graphical Union of North America, on this,
our Labor day, send you fraternal greetings to
the number of 40,000."
And we of the trades unions have brothers

You all remember the strike at Homestead,
where thousands of poor men were thrown out
of employment because they asked for a rate
of wages "whereby they could keep body and
soul together. You all remember the relentless
tyranny of that rich man who held the for

remember how, during the labor troubles, he

Pinkerton detectives, to shoot down free Amer

their heaven-born right of protecting their
labor and providing for their wives and chil
dren â hired these Pinkerton detectives, beside
whom the myrmidons of old who followed
Achilles against the walls of Troy were gentle
menâaye, they were patricians.

favored in worldly goods that he was able to
employ thousands of his fellow-creatures to
work lor him, aud picture the pitiable spec
tacle of this man hiring unscrupulous wretches
to protect him from the imaginary onulaughts
of bis own workmenâ when he could have
been loved by them, when he should have
been their counselor and their friend.

The more carefully workingmen investi
gate the problem here in California, as
elsewhere, the more thoroughly are they
convinced tnat their inability to get em
ployment is due to the brief reign of free
trade that has already afflicted them.
It was recently shown in The Calt., in a
series of interviews with typical working
men, just how they realize ihat free trade
hurts them. In a simple, manly way the
sons of toil told why they favor protection
as the forerunner of prosperity.
"Statistics gathered from every State in
the Union within the past eighteen
months," said George L. Nolan, a promi
nent Eastern manufacturer's asent, a few
days ago, "show that one cut of wages
has followed another with great regulai
ity under the Wilson bill, and iÂ»ost of the
factories that are now running are en
abled to do so by reason of reduced forces
and lower wages."
children of the same God, and that he is no
respector of persons. True, his kingdom has
been placed above the skies, yet we pray, "Thy
kingdom come on earth." We have been told
thatour bodies~are the temples of the living
God, until the laÂ«h, if not abolished, has be
come disreputable, and the selling of that
temple by others Is practically abolished, yet,
by their control of the means of living, we are
forced to sell ourselves.
Men have felt and reasoned that when there
is equality before God any inequality before
man must be wrong, And so. as I said, we
have at least a pretense of equality before the
law and in the State, and organizationâpoliti
cal organization â bas given us so much thereof
as we have, and as we have been able to keep,
in spite of registration laws, educational and
property qualifications.
Now, friends, as religious organization based
upon religious discontent gave us religious
liberty in spite of the stake, as political organi
zation gave us such political equality as we
have in spite of the scaffold and the prl'son, so
will industrial democracy come through in
dustrial organization, hostile employers, hos
tile legislation, apostate churches, cowardly
and selfish workmen notwithstanding.
It is therefor we organize into trade unions
and why we brand the unaniliated workmun
as a scab. This is why we strike against reduc
tion in the standard of living or to improve it;
this is why we hear with joy of progress made
during the past year. And, friends, there has
been progress, both in this and other countries.
The trade-union movement is growing in num
bers, in knowledge and in consciousness of its
mission, and it is proud of the indorsement of
such men as Engels, Mark, Tnorald Rogers,
Ruskin, Carlyle and Ely and can afford to
listen in kindness to the criticism of some of
the socialist*, whose fundamental principles
are the motive power of the practical move
ment, though we disagree with them in some
things, and especially in methods.
The trade-union movement can look wtth
pity upon such movements as the Employers'
Association, organized in 1892 to crusn labor
and then to stimulate "home industry." The
unions suffered and thereby were purified and
had their horizon enlarged, but what of home
industry? Eastern shoes, Eastern cigars, East
ern castings, Eastern almost everything, until
our manufacturers are but the agents of East
ern firms selling Eastern goods, while Califor
nia machinery is rusting. Molding shops are
idle, while such eminent and loyal members
of the Home Manufacturers' Association as
Holbrook, Merrill & Stetson are selling Oregon
prison- made stoves. Shoe factories idle, while
Eastern prison goods fill the market ! And
yet they cannot see that their methods are
destructive. True, labor also suffers, but then
labor Is used to that, and besides, men may
move while buildings stay, and while the
Half-Million Club is talking work workers go
Eadt in Coxey's armies or otherwise, and the
half-million comes not to the city divided
against itself.
But we cannot afford to think lightly of the
efforts made through the press now and then
to have laws enacted to punish what it pleases
them to call "conspiracies in restraint of
trade," while under the name of arbitration
they offer us laws to forbid organization, and
even men who think themselves friends call
out from the very housetop* tliat "trade-union
ism is a failure and the strike a weariness of the
flesh," To tnlK of the equality of Huntington,
employing 75,000 men, and his section-hand
is well enough as a sedative, but we must be
awake to the danger ahead. Employing 75,000
men, having the power to say what our earn
ings shall be, what hours we shall work, to de
termine our standard of life, to say when we
shall see our families, what the children's
educatiou shall be, a power to regulate the
daily life of some 300,000 men, women and
children, and to bring this power home to us
unceasingly, every hour of the day, when the
overseer looks at our work or nt us when we
straighten our backs, at every evening, when
we may be told, -'You are not wanted here any
more"; every morning at the factory gate
waiting for that sign which to the worker
means so much that around it centers almost
every thought, and this daily need, this daily
dependence, is sent along with us even to the
ballot-box.. In the history of the Saxon or
Gotho-Germanic races was ever such poorer
given to individual man?
The struggle, therefore, to-day is between
religious and political equality seelfing to ex
tend and complete itself by occupying the
industrial field and industrial aDsolutism
seeking to stop the progress of the ages and
turn the march backward. This danger is
real, and it expresses itself by gradually chang
ing our very Government from one ot specific
delegated powers to one in which the powers
are to be inherent.
That is the picture of the ruin thus far
wrought, yet it is mild, indeed, compared
with whaf the plans of Bryan would do,
were he allowed to open the free-trade
throttle to the extent he desires.
Another picture of the rnin that pre
vails in free-trade countries is that made
by the eminent John Bright, who por
trayed the condition of Glasgow; but, hor
rible as the condition there was, it is that
which free trade would speedily bring
here. He said :
'â In the city of Glasgow alone 41,000 out
of every 100,000 live in homes having only
one room, and, further, nearly one-third
of the whole people dwell in homes of only
one room, and more than two-thirds of the
people of Scotland dwell in homes of not
more than two rooms.
"We find poverty and misery. What
does it mean, when all these families are
living in homes of one room, to us who
have several rooms and all the comforts
of life? It means more than I can de
scribe and more than I will attempt to
enter into; and as need besets need, so
poverty and misery beget poverty and
misery. And so in all our great towns,
and not a little in our small tow^s, there
is misery and helplessness, much as I
have described. In fact, looking at the
past, to me it is a melancholy thing to
look at; there is much of it which excites
in me not astonishment only, but horror.
The fact is, there passes before my eyes a
vision of millions of families â not indi
viduals, but families â fathers, mothers,
children â passing, ghastly, sorrow
stricken, in never-ending procession liom
their cradles to their graves."
The workingmen of America have had a
slight foretaste of what John Bright
meant, for they know that the country is
now on the way to desolation under the
free-trade policy of which the Wilson bill
is a mild forerunner. They begin to sea
that there was wisdom in the policy of
Clay and Blame, a protective plan to pre
serve American industries and American
liberties.
That "wealth is king" we have recognized
for some time, and any who doubts may ask
the blacklisted trade-unionists, who, under
changed names, are seeking the means of life
away from, their homes. We have, therefore,
conspired to dethrone this kinz, nonce they
give to our organizations the names of con
spiracies in restraint of trade, and under the
guise of "good of society" they would now, as
in the times of Caesar, issue edicts to destroy
this growing industrial democrat! before it
shall become numerous and strong enough to
form an Industrial republic or to effectually
curtail the power or Industrial despotism.
That the hope of the future lie-; in organized
labor has been recognized by all students of
the social question.
In closing, let me therefore again urge upon
you the necessity of organization. If you be
opposed to absolutism join your trades union,
or if your occupation be such that you neither
have nor can have one, then give to this move
ment your moral support. If you would lnv
prove the moral condition of the workers and
put some restraint on, this "king," then sup
port this trades-union movement. If you be a
Christian and hope for the coming of the
kingdom for which you , pray, then sup
port organization. If you be a workman,
hoping . for better times to come in
the immediate future, then organize. Organ
ize into trade unions; into trade unions be
cause you who work at the same trade under
stand each other best, and mutual grievances
give mutual sympathy. Let us organize to
gether that we may bear each other's burdens,
but above all let us organize that we may study
jointly, study that we may jointly know, and
know that we may act jointly in the interest
of peace and progress in the times dangerous
and doubtful, which, according to all students
of sociology, are coming, times in which It may
be decided for ages to come whether wealth
should rule man or man be ''a man for a*
that."
A song, "Rally," was given by the com
poser and writer, Professor Henri Fair
weather; who was accompanied by his
wife on the piano. v . -".
The Rev. Anna 11. Shaw was introduced.
She was received with wild applause from
all parts of the house, and indeed, her
address on "Woman's Freedom," was
none the less warmly greeted, lor the
audience was with the distinguished
speaker.
Miss Shaw addressed the union men as
"fellow workmen," and told the audience
that there is no place in this world for a
man who is not serving the race, or seek
ing to serve it. There is no use either in
this universe for a woman who is not
nervine her race, or seeking to serve it.
She said that inventions, machines, bad
taken the work of the household into the
workshops, and women followed them to
the factories. Women going outside of
the houses to toil merely followed their
vocations where changed conditions sent
them.
It is a mistaken idea, Miss Shaw de
clared, that women are toiling selfishly.
It is the misfortune of men that they have
been incapacitated for toil, and in 'New
York the r e are 20,000 women supporting
husbands who have been laid aside by
sickness or accident. All over the coun
try women are toiling for their bread, and
it has been their greatest misfortune that
heretofore they Lave worked alone. By
organization only can they meet and
overcome the conditions against which
men and women alike are struggling. She
said to the women of San Francisco, Or
ganize! â¢
"It takes men a long time to learn that
what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the
gander," she continued.
"It has taken men wno have been sing
ing 'The Land of the Free and the Home
of the Brave' for 100 years just 100 years
to realize that it is as important for them
that woman should have the same free
dom and power by which she can attain
to her highest development. What is
wealth? Some man has said 'wealth is
King.' He was right. What is the wealth
of the world? Is it the gold stored up?
Labor is wealth ; labor is King. You have
your right hand of labor free, but the left
hand of labor is tied. Untie this hand
then, so that the women laborers of Cali
fornia may go with you to the ballot-box.
Yon laborers are under the greatest disad
vantages to-day because women are dis
franchised.
"As the men toilers of the State need the
ballot-box to protect themselves, so/too,
the women toilers need the ballot-box to
protect them. If men need the ballot
and organization to protect their integ
rity, their manhood, how much more does
woman need it to protect her virtue, her
integrity, her womanhood?"
In the name of the women organiza
tions of the country she thanked the labor
unions for what good they have done for
omen.
The orchestra broke in upon the ap
plause following Miss Shaw's closing
words with "Home Sweet Home" and the

Kxpianation.
The arrow files with '.he wind. The top figures
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
days; those underneath It, if any, the amount of j
rainfall, of melted snow In Inches and hundredths, â¢
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect pom s of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hit'h" means high barometric pressure and
Is usably accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high In the interior
and low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable;
bat when the "low" Is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "hiith" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmei
weather may be expected in summer and colder
' weather in winter. The reverse of these condition*
kill produce an opposite result.

KOVEL SUIT FOR DAMAGES.
A Young Man Who Thinks He Might
Have Settled When H s Anger
Had Cuoied Off
. Oakland Office San Franci&co Call,)
908 Broadway, Sept. 7. - S
A very novel suit has been filed against
George Sterling In the Justices' Court.
Sterling is sued for $25. being the value of
a lady's dress "spoiled and rendered unfit
lor use because ot the negligence of the
defendant."
The plaintiff i 3 Mrs. Petersen of Jiast
Oakland, and the suit has caused a good
deal of small talk because of the socia!
standing of the defendant, who is a San
Francisco insarance man, and very popular
on this side ot the bay.
About two weeks ago Mr. Sterling was
making a visit from his home in East
Oakland to a sick iriend in Berkeley. As
a little gift, he placed a bottle of claret in
his overcoat pocket, which he carried on
his arm, as the evening was warm. He
hailed a Hay wards car at East Seventeenth
etreet and Ninth avenue and sat in the
front seat on the outside, carelessly throw
ing his overcoat on the seat beside him.
At the rear end of the same seat Mrs.
Petersen sat. The car had not gone far
when it met the grade on the west side of
the Twelfth-street dam. This is a steep
grade, and Mr. Sterling was about one foot
higher from sea level than the lady at the
lower end. So was his overcoat and the
bottle of claret.
He was encagea in deep thought, when
he was suddenly aroused from his evening
dream by the lady exclaiming, "Sir, what
have you done!"
Quick as lightning Mr. Sterling looked
around and saw that the cork was out of
the claret bottle and that the greater por
tion of the contents had coursed along the
seat. The lady wore a beautiful sum
mer gown of pale blue.
An apology was at once made, but the
lady declared that the gentleman should
pay for the dress. Sterling glanced at his
own ruined overcoat and thought that
loss enough for one evening, especially as
he was on an errand of mercy. He ex
pressed no desire to .recompense the lady,
but got off the car and looked at his over
coat and talked about the dam till he
boarded a returning car.
"I suppose it was my carelessness that
spoilt the lady's dress," said Sterling, "but
Ido not like to be sued for it. If "I had
been aÂ«ked to settle when I had cooled off
a little I would have done it. I have an
idea that the railroad track is not in good
condition and that the jolting of the car
removed the cork, and if I can only prove
that why then the railroad company is
the guilty party. It is just possible, how
ever, that I may compromise."
RECTOR LANE RESIGNS.
He Opposed the Vestry's Action
in Taking the Matter Before
the Church.
Mason and French's Claim of Victory
Did Not Meet With His
Approval.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Sept. 7.â Rev. W. M.
Lane, rector of Christ's Episcopal Church,
presented his resignation to the vestry of
that organization ai a meating held to
night, with a request that it be accepted at
once, a* lie was done with the ministry.
He will practice law in this city, and
Â«mong his first cases will be one agaiu<t
those who have slandered him while in
the church, so he says.
This is the result of a war waged against
him by P. E. Mason and F. M. French,
two members ol the church who were the
means of him b^ing called to this place.
The story is best told in his own wonls as
he related them to a Call representative,
rie said :
"The trouble began with the resignation
of Rev. Mr. Perkins, one of the best min
isters our church ever* uad. He resigned
in April of last year after serving the
church for fourteen years. There were a
few troublesome old women In the church
who made their boasts thut they would
make it hot for his successor, whoever he
might be. Those are the conditions I
found when I came here, a stranger, un
biased, knowing not a soul fa the congre
caiion. I callod upon tne various mem
bers and told them I hoicd that they
would not- connect me with any former
trouble. a:s I knew nothing oi it. I have
heard since that some of those very women
5-aid, afttr inviting me to their homes:
â¢Just think: 1 asked him here and lie
didn't tell me anything about his life. 1
"Did the}' expect me to tel! every old
woman all of my sorrows and grief*? i
never nave. Of course I have many thines
to grieve me. Is it any of their affairs if I
made a mistake at 18 and married and am
r.n harpy. I am mar. enougli to adotit
that I made a great mistake when a boy
of 18 I married, and I tola them I was
married, but my wife would not be here
with me. 1 defy any one lo point a finger
to a day or act anywhere in these fourteen
years and say it has even the appearance
of evil.
".Mason and French are responsible for
me being here. It was they that insisted
that the vestry lim^t call me, as I was a
After a. while rumors were cir
culated about my dress, my talking onl
the streets to other gentlemen and goinsi !
over io San Francisco and taking dinner j
v.itn H. K. Field. Mow 1 don't
wear a long, sanctimonious face. I
don't believe in it. I have the umc right
to wear a business ?uit as you or any other
man. Mason believes in candles and all
olthe rites of the ritualistic church, bat I
do not. He asked me to use candles and
I re/used, telling him the members would
not permit it.
"When I left to go on my vacation
Ma^o'.i vi-itud all the steamboat and rail
road bflieea trying to find where I hud
fone. lie said that I had gone to
Honolulu. On my resuru I excommuni
cnted Mason and French and called a
meeting of the vestry for the first Monday
night in August. 'At that time I told
them what I had done and for them to
t:*ke ihe matter in hand. They met in
Mr. Field's office in San Francisco, and
Mr. Mason and Mr. French appeared.
The result of that meeting was this letter:
The Vettry of Christ Church, .-UaroerfaâGentle
men: Having had an opportunity of meet
ing you and discu^siug with you the sub
ject of the rumors which lor some ,
time have been current In Alameda, re
flecting on the character of your rector,
Rev. w. M. Lane, we take occasion to say thai
we personally have not made any charees
against Mr. Lane; that we have no personal
knowledge of anything detrimental to his
character as a clergyman; that we have no
feeling against him*, and we desire to assure
Mr. Lane, through you, of our sympathy with
him in the position in which he h*s been
placed by reason of the attacks upon his char
acter. Yours respectfully, Frkd E MAfIOX.
r. M. Fkench.
"This I refused to accept at first, but the
vestry pressed me. on the ground that it
would hurt the church if I did not, and it
was better to take their denial than a con
fession, for those whom they had talked
to would catch them in the lie any way. At
last I consented and wrote them the fol
lowing:
Dear Sir: The vestry having submitted to
me your communication of the 6tn inst. I

"Tins they took around exclaiming, 'I
told you so,' 'See, he backs down,' and j
such expressions, without ever showing
their letter of denial or referring to it.
Then the vestry submitted to me a letter
i they intended presenting ;o the member
! ship of the church yesterday. It referred
; to the rumors in general terms without
| mentioning any of them, and then says:
To such an extent has this been carried that
! the rector at tast. though very reluctantly,
' feit himself obliged to suspend two members
i of the congregation from all rights of com
j munion. Those members are F. K. Mason and
I F. M. French.
Thereupon, and at the request ot those gen
j tlemen, the vestry took the matter in hand,
! desiring not only to remove any aspersions
I upon the rector, if found unjust or unwar-
I ranted, but to restore the gentleman named to
the rifcht of communion.
As the result of our investigation we can find
i no facts, nor any person who can substantiate
! any facts, detrimental to trie moral character
i of the rector, and we can come to no other con-
I elusion than that he has been most unwar
rantably aspersed and maligned.
"I objected to this, but they insisted, and
I toid them that if they did my resignation
I went with it, and it will to-night. I will
live right here and practice law, and will
j see that I have redress for these slanders.
The resignation was accepted and a vote I
; of confidence in the honor and integrity of
Rev. Mr. Lane was passed. Mr. Mason
j and Mr. French have left the church and
' will hereafter worship somewhere else.

The Trustees.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Sept. 7.â The Board
of Trustees met to-night and passed a
large batch of bills, many of which will
i not be paid at present, owing to the lack

meeting, was remedied by an order which
j provides for the policeman on duty at the
: City Hall to notify the engineer at the
water wotks at Fitchburg whenever an
alarm of fire is sounded. Each morning
he must make a report to the chief. This
| order was brought about by the lack of

weeks ago.

haven of rest. The veteran yachtsman
coiled up his ropes and cleared his decks
Saturday night and just as the sunset flag
was dipping be made his final port.
No yachtsman is better known on the
coast, and especially aroui^d the bay. Cap
tain Moody has lived from his early boy
hood, which was passed in his native State
of Massachusetts on the water. His salt
tanned features were those of a typical old
time Boston skipper who held sway on the
Atlantic seaboard before the inartistic
smokestack with its following of brass-be
dizened officers wrecked the legitimate pro
fession of a ?ailor.
Captain Moody was an artist in every
sense of the word. His very sailing of a
yacht was a picture. He would paint deli
cate water-color marine views and was a
lover of Byron and other poets, whose
verses he would quote at length to suit all
occasions. He held a pilot's certificate
and for many years performed pilotage
duty on the coast and on the bay.
Many years ago he was yacht-master for
: old Cornelius Vanderbilt and made many
; short voyages with his wealthy master,
i He came to the Pacific Coast in 1851 and
; was yacht-master for a time for Dr. Sam
| Merritt. For many years he has sailed
yachts on tee bay and every yachtsman
! was his friend. His last appointment was
witli City Engineer Wilsoii, who owns the

captain was an honorary member, was de
signed by him, and at the time of his
death he was engaged upon a design for
an ensign lor the newly projected Inter-
Club Yacht Association.
The old sailor was very particular, and
one or the little things in life that always
annoyed him was to see a picture of an
anchor in which the stock and flukes are
not placed at right angles, as they should
be. He frequently said when talking
lightly that if any one sent a floral anchor
to his funeral that was not correctly made
he believed he would turn over in his
casket. His friends did send a beautiful
floral anchor to his funeral this morning,
but. being yachtsmen.the emblem of Hope
was correctly built.
In his room he Jhad several paint
ings and artistic pieces of work, and his
friends considered it a pleasure to visit
him in his quarters and listen to his rem
iniscences. He was always affable, pleas
ant and congenial and as much of a gen
tleman on the quarter-deck as in the
drawing-room.
Captain Moody was 81 years of age and
leaves two daughters. One is married and
the other was with him when the final
watch closed. Unlike most sailors Cap
tain Moody was a total abstainer and a
cup of tea was the strongest beverage in
which he was known to indulge.
AN ERRONEOUS REPORT.
St. Mary'ft College Baseball Flayers
Object to Misrepresentation.
OAKLAND, Cal., Sept. 7.â The follow
ing letter has been handed in for publica
tion:
In the report of the ball game between the
St. Ignatius College and the Pacifies at the Pre
sidio on Sunday, the whole matter was said to
bf a gram! mistake because the team irom St.
Mary's College dm not put in an apperance.
One baseball enthusiast of the college, It is
true, sent a challenge to the St. Ignatius team,
but it was without the authority of the student
body, and Its acceptance was rejected for the
reason that football is now occupying the
abilities of the college athletes.
A committee from St. Ignatius Coll were
so informed last Tuesdny and again last Thurs
day, so we see no reason why we disappointed
the lovers of the National game at the Presidio
last Sunday and* why we should lose a game
by default. V.v have held the college baseball
championship for the lust three years and are
the possessors of the championship cup pre
sented by the Midwinter Fair and have always
been ready to defend the title at the proper
time, and when the baseball season of all
recognized colleges opens we will be in the
field to defend our title.

Again.
CO-EDS IN EVIDENCE.

TENTS FOR CLASSROOMS.
Canvas May Be Brought Into Use to
Meet the Demand for More
Room.
BERKELEY, Cal., Sept 7.â The fresh
men and sophomores at the State Uni
versity had another violent rush at mid
day to-day, which resulted, after an hour
and a half of fighting, in a signal victory for
the freshmen. The co-eds played a lead
ing band in the affair, having taken unto
themselves the duty of cutting their class
men loose with jackknives, and of run
ning the hospital and ambulance corps.
Co-ed Florence Nightingales were on
hand by the score. A number of serious
accidents occurred during the course of
the fight. James Ely, the big sophomore
halfback, was kicked on the right temple
by a freshman and had to be conveyed
from the campus in a buggy, after having
been nursed by four co-eds for half an
hour on a bench under an evergreen tree.
Kuster "00" and Wolf "00" botfi got
laid out. Wolf received a severe injury of
the back, and Kuster was kicked in the
stomach.
Before the fight commenced some of the
co-eds who were in the cymasium handed
out through the windows football suits,
shoes, stockings and other rushing gar
ments to the participants in the battle for
class honors. They stayed with the boys
all through the melee, and after it was
over two loyal " '99" girls bought a dozen
watermelons and had them dumped near
the "gym" for the sophomores.
The rush began at about 12:30 and con
tinued until 2 o'clock. When the last
sophomore nad been tied it was found
that thirty-six of them were piled up near
the bsickstep. It took about fifty fresh
men, with the assistance of the juniors, to
do the work.
The midday "scrap" was precipitated
by the freshmen, who had painted a huge
"00" on the backstop in red and ereen
p;unt. Hart. McCleave, Ruttles, Masters,
vVoodsum, Hazeltine. Nyman, French,
Rainey and O'Toole did the work with the
paint brush and then dared the sopho
mores to deface.the number.
Tae soi'hs soon mustered their forces
and swooped down, twenty-rive strong,
upon the ten freshies. For a time the '99
men had things their own way, but soon
the freshmen were re-enforced and the tide
was turned. More sophomores came, and
the forces were aboutevenly divided. The
freshmen were slow to respond, but finally
t.ey turned out in sufficient numbers to
entirely overwhelm the '99 men. By the
time they had been at their "mill" for half
an hour a crowd of at least 300 other stu
dents had gathered on the scene. It being
broad daylight the rush waa pursued with
more violence than ordinarily attends a
night rush, on account oi the increased
opportunity for one marj to take advant
age of another.
The co-eds brought water in junior
plugs to the exhausted "rushers," fanned
and rubbed with camphor the foreheads of
the stunned and cut loose the baling-roDe
that bound the helpless arms and legs of
their friends.
About ten minutes before the end of the
battle had been reached George Wilcox, a
local photographer, appeared with hia
camera to take a few snapshots. He wa<
spied by some seniors and in less time
than it takes to tell the story his photo
graphic plates were smashed to atoms and
one leg of his tripod pnlled completely
out of its socket and cracked into splinters.
Pieces of the camera were distributed
amoncr the sophomores and seniors as
souvenirs.
When the affair was over and the vic
tory won a more bediaepled set of earth
scoured college men never walked off the
Berkeley campus in daylight. To have
racb a monster rush on the campus in the
daytime is a decidedly infrequent occur
rence. While the affair was in progress a
number of the facuity stood to one side
and gazed on the scene, bat no one raised
a hand against the progress of the time
honored college battle.

DEATH OE HUGH WILSON,
The Well-Known Society Man
Drowned While Eathing
Near Antioch.
He Was on His Way to Stockton for
the Native Sons' Annual
Celebration.
Oakxasd Office Fan Fbancibco Call,)
908 Broadway, Sept. 7. )
J. C. Wil son received & dispatch from
Stockton to-night stating that his son
Hugh had met death while bathing near
Antioch. Hugh Wilson, who is one of
the best known society and club men in
Oakland, was swimming with a party of
friends when he was attacked with cramp,
and before assistance could be rendered
he sank.
Last Saturday Wilson left this city with
a small party on board his father's yacht
Nathalie. Their intention was to sail to
Stockton for the Admission day exercises.
Hugh Wilson was in charge of the yacht,
as be is an expert sailor, and a fine run
was mads to Vallejo, where yesterday was
spent A start was made up the San
Joaquin, and the marsh between Antioch
and Stockton was reached. On reaching
a pleasant anchorage the young men pro
posed a swim, and the proposition was
carried out. Wilson was seized with
cramp and sank, and his body has not yet
be&n recovered.
A dispatch was sent to Oakland from
Stockton and was delivered to J. C. Wilson
Jr., Hugh's brother. Mayor Davie and
ex-Mayor Chapman carried the fearful
news to the fatner, and when it reached
the ears of Mrs. J. C. Wilson Jr. she
swooned and was unconscious for several
hours. The notice oi his death was posted
at the Athenian Club and created great
sorrow all over town.
No two men in Oakland are better
known than Huerb Wilson and his brother.
Huuh Wilson was only 24 years of age,
and was a clurt man and rising man of
business. Only lately his father, whose
places of business are in Oakland and San
Francisco, turned over the management oi

Prohibitionists to Nominate * County
Ticket "Wednesday.
OAKLAND, Cal., Sept. 7.â The Ala
meda County Prohibitionists will hold
their convention at Hamilton Hall
Wednesday next at 10 a. m. There wUI
be present State Chairman Coulter, who
will speak to-morrow evening before the
Younz Men's Prohibition Club in upper
Hamilton Hall at S o'clock. Professor S.
P. Meads, an old-time worker in the cause
here, in speaking of the situation, has this
to say :
In regard to the effect of the presence of the
Prohibition ticket In Nitional politics, opin
ions differ. The Democrat* hope that the re
jection of the '.ree-silver jilank by the Prohibi
tionists in their National Convention will lead
many of the silver Prohibitionists to bolt to
Brva'n.
In this, however, they are likely to be greatly
mistaken. In this State pronounced silver
Prohibitionists are standing by the Nationsl
ticket, Levering and Johnson, because they
esteem the Prohibition issue of iar greater im
portance than any other. The few exceptions
only prove the rule.
The "National" bolters are nearly ail return
ing to the Prohibition ranks. The probability
is that for the rirst time in the history of the
Prohibition party in National politics its
proence will help the â  Republican party.
Levering of Maryland, their candidate for
President, was formerly a Democrat, as was
also Johnson, their candidate for Viee-Presi
dent. Ger*.', their candidate for Governor of
Illinois, was until very recently one of the
leading Democratic attorneys in tho State.
Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of the Dem
ocrats in ice Stttesof Maryland, Kentucky and
Illinois, as well as in ottier doubtful States,
Will ior the first time vote the Prohibition
ticket. There is no doubt that in the States
mentioned, as well as in several others, the
presence of the Prohibition ticket will draw
more votes from the Democrats than from the
Republicans.

"WAGNER" AND SOCIETY
Thousands Listen to Splendid
Interpretations of the
Composer's Genius.
Attractive Programme Arranged for
Tc-Night and the Balance
of the Week.
Wagner night at the Mechanics' Expo
sition was a brilliant success, musically
and socially. For four hours last night
great throngÃ of people promenaded the
big Pavilion, listening to every note,
while along the balcony and around the
bandstand hundreds more gathered.
Whatever success Bcheel of not-unfor
gotten fame might have attained Hin
richs more than fills the vacancy created
by his absence. As a leader he is superb,
and as a musician he is the peer of many
who would place themselvea above him.
The concert last night opened with the
"Kniser March," followed by an overture
("Tannhauser"). In all, eight selections
were rendered, and each piece seemed to
be better than its predecessor. The entire
programme was as follows:
â¢'Kaiser March" : overture, "Tannhauser";
â¢election from "Flying Dutchman"; eupho
nium solo, -'Evening Star Song," from "Tann
hauser," W. H. Calverd; selection from
"Walkure"; entr'acte and bridal chorus,
"Lohengrin' 1 ; introduction, third act "Meis
tersinger"; grand march, "Tannhauser."
The American concert band is composed
of fifty pieces, and it is nor, assuming too
much to say that its superior has hardly
if ever been seen in this City. It is
understood that a movement is on foot to
give symphony concerts on Sunday. If
the scheme is carried through it will prob
ably prove attractive, as the machinery
will not be in operation, and consequently
there will be nothing to mar the harmony
of the occasion.
For this afternoon and evening a special
musical programme has been arranged.
This is Chinese night and it is expected
that the Celestials will attend in great
numbers. This afternoon children from
the Chinese school, Agassiz Primary,
Broadway Grammar and Clement Gram
mar will b9 in attendance. The musical
programme is as follows:
AFTERNOON.
March, "Front Section," Horst; festival
overture, Lindpaiuter; waltz, "Graefen
berger," Guugle; solo for cornet (selected),
William M&hood: "Grand Review of Aida,"
Verdi; overture, "Maritana," Wallace;
"Marche Heroiqus," Saint-Saens; "Forge in the
Forest," Michaeles; "Fantaiste Hungarese,"
Burgmein; polka, "Thunder and Lightning,"
Strauss.
EVENING.
March, "Naval Battalion." Roncovieri; over

Difficulties With a Furniture
Home.
On a claim of Joseph Fredericks <fc Co.,
which had been assigned to L. Jacobi, a
collector, the household furniture of Mrs.

tographer, was attached yesterday, the
Deputy Sheriff invading her residence at
733 Ashbury street for that purpose.
Mrs. Marceau says that she is too busy
settling her divorce suit with her hus

small matters, ami that when she is free
she will liquidate all her indebtedness.

THEY WILL PUT
UP THE TICKET
True-Blue Democrats Will
Nominate Presidential
Electors.
LOYAL TO THE CAUSE.
The Sound-Money League Merely
Awaits a State Expression
of Opinion.
CONFERENCE SATURDAY NIGHT.
The Real Democracy Awakens and
Practically Decides to Get Up
the Big Petition.
A Palmer and Buckner electoral ticket
rose definitely above the horizon of Cali
fornia politics yesterday.
The sound-money, true- blue Democrats,
who are loyal to Jeffersonian Democracy,
their party's honor and themselves, and
who regard their party's future, yesterday
took hold of the question seriously and
with a sort of careful enthusiasm. The
leading sound-money Democrats are
heartily in iavor of it, a few are doubtful
and none have opposed it.
As this wing of the party cannot use the
party name, it will require to rile with the
Secretary of State, withiu a short time, a
petition with about 8000 signatures, to get
the ticket on the general ballot.
At first this was not seriously consid
ered, it being the plan of the leading mem
bers of the Sound-money Democratic
League to simply distribute widely sound
money literature and to help defeat Bryan
by either voting for McKinley or staying
away from tne polls. Since the In
dianapolis convention heroically put
forth its platform and ticket the party in
California has become infused with a de
sire to be loyal to the cause in a way that
will count the most and mean the most.
There is pride in the platform, pride in
tlie ticket and pride in the spirit that rules
this hopeless cause â hopeless, that is, this
present campaign." There is a general de-
Bire to vote as American citizens lor that
for which sacrifice and labor is being
given. Many of ihe sound-money Demo
crats demand this with enthusiasm.
T:iis question was the principal one be
fore the executive committee of tne Sound
money Democratic League of California,
whicn met in executive session at head
quarters in the Milis building yesterday,
with Â£. B. Pond iu the chair. It was fa
variuly considered by all present, but
there was much about the law of the situ
tion â the process required, and so onâ
that was not clearly known, and then the
sentiment of tLe 3ound money Demo
crats ot the whole State was wanted. For
these reasons no definite action was taken
yesterday.
Dr. Ed'ward R. Taylor, president of the
league, vras present, and when it was deÂ»
cided that a meeting of the entire league |
should consider the project he at once
cailed a meeting of the league for that
purpose, to be held in the assembly-room
of the Mills building next Saturday even
ing.
In the meantime the Los Angeles, San
Diego and Santa Barbara leagues will be
consulted, along with representative
sound-money Democrats in other parts of
the State, and next Saturday evening defi
nite action will be taken.
It was pointed out yesterday that it
would not require very much time or
money to secure 8000 signatures. Eighty
petitions receiving 100 names each would
do it, for instance, and signatures could be
easily obtained everywhere by wholesale,
as it would not be necessary to look only
for â  money Democrats.
As the electoral nominations will be
purely honorary ones, a ticket would be
readily agreed upon to accompany the pe
tition. Letters which will elicit general
sentiment will be sent out by Secretary
Elliott McAllister to-day. There is but
alight doubt, however, that the ticket will
be filed.
There is a disposition to put California
in line with the rest of the States, for one
thing. There is also in the minds of those
favoring the effort the consideration that
four years after the defeat and burial of
the Bryan- .Populist Democracy the party
will recover its sanity and stand clothed
in its right mind and again be true to its
principles and traditions. At that time
the honor-bright Democracy of this year,
with its great proportion oi the party in
the East, and with so large a proportion
of the real party leaders, : will be the
nucleus of a reorganized and purified
party. The California organization will
count for something then, for it will be
legally a party with a party machinery.
There is also the consideration that a
great many Democrats not in sympathy
with Bryanism will vote, and vote the party
ticket rather than for McKinley if they
have no place else to go. These considera
tions and the sentiment that goes with
them promises a Palmer and Buckner
ticket to California with little doubt.
At the meeting yesterday the distribu
tion of campaign literature, which will go
actively on anyway, was discussed at
length. In a day or two ten campaign
documents, aggregating 500,000 copies,
will be received from the printer and they
will be systematically put before the
voters of the State.

AMERICAN PROTECTION AND BIMETALLISM.
M'KINLEY IN THE
NORTH COUNTRY
Senator J. M. Gleaves Gives
a Good Account of His
Section.
PROTECTION THE ISSUE.
The People Understanding That
It Is of More Importance
Than Finance.
OPPORTUNITY FOR ORATORY.
The Senator Says That McKinley Is
Continually Gaining and That the
Outlook Is Improving.
Hon. J. M. Gleaves, Senator from the
Second District of California, is at the
Grand Hotel.
"The political outlook in our section,"
said Senator G!eaves last evening, "is un
usually good, and it gets better every day.
While there is no part of California in
which politics are more badly mixed up,
the prospects for the Republicans to make
a good record is constantly improving.
There were more people crazy on the sil
ver issue earlier in tne campaign than
there are now. Protection is now con
sidered to be of much more importance,
with the incidental friendship of Major
McKintey to silver, and free-silver men
are finding that protection is really the
main issue.
"What we really need up in my district
now is a supply of good talkers. There is
a fine opportunity to educate the people.
Tne miners think deeply and bo do the
other wide-awake people up there, and
they want some enlightenment. Shasta
County is a great lumber county, the wool
interest is very large, and so is fruit. All
these industries need protection. Very
few Republicans have gone off after the
silver craze up that way. We have Demo
crats up there who have always voted the
Democratic ticket who say that they are
going to vove for McKinley this time,
once if no more.
"As a member and secretary of the
County Central Committee 1 travel about
a great deal and have a chance to ascer
tain what the peope are talking about
and how they feel. As a mining engineer
I come much in contact with miners,
visiting Â»ll over the county. I hear all
around the same story, which is that Mc-
Kinley is steadily gaining.
"The Populists are fighting among
themselves. There are middle-of-the-road
men, who are actuated solely by principle,
and these are opposed to all dickering or
fusion and are straight out all the time.
Then there are the fusion Populists, who
have the loaves and lishes in view, but
who have been pretty well knocsed out
by the Supreme Court decision on the
county government act. We will elect our
Superior Judge and Assemblyman. Bar
ham has as easy a walk-over as any Con
gressional candidate in this State. He
will canvass the district thoroughly and
will speak at Redding Saturday night.
The people like him and know him.
Neither of the other candidates is well
known.
"There are no local issues in the fight.
It will be a straight out fight of the Re
publicans against the field. I do not be
lieve that there will be many votes polled
up theie for the gold Democratic National
ticket. The people will vote for either
McKinley or Bryan, as no one but a

We have a McKinley club at Redding
with a members ip oi 150. Mr. Campbell,
of the firm of Campbell, Reddy & Metson,
addressed the club last Thursday night
and had a good meeting.
"Times are getting better in Shasta
and Siskiyou counties. Mining properties
are strong and there is a good demand.
The Iron Mountain mine owners are mak
ing a grand success of that property and
have the largest mine in California. We
are just about closing a deal for another
property which is about as lar^e as the
Iron Mountain mine. Electric power will
be used to run mills ail along the river,
and it comes in well because wood is grow
ing scarce.''

THE BEAR CLUB.
An Enthusiastic Gathering and an
Elecion of Officers.
The Bear Club uad a very large attend
ance at its weekly meeting at B'nai B'nth
Hall on Eddy street last night, the occa
sion being the annual election of officers.
This club has but lately changed from a
district club, being one of the Western
Addition clubs, to that of purely a Na
tional club, its prime object being to look
alter the head of the ticKet. To that end
the club has moved its quarters down
town. It has now a membership of up
ward of three hundred voters, including a
drill corps of one hundred and thirty men.
The corps expects to make an imposing
appearance in public parades, as it is
handsomely uniformed and equipp d.
There were twenty-turee new members
elected last night and there are a large
number of applications yet to be acted
upon.
The election of officers resulted as fol
lows: President, Tuomas W. Collins;
first vice-president, I. P. Kincaid ; second
vice-president, Charles Man waring; third
vice-president, Henry C. Dibble; record

and W. W. Wade.
After the election the club repaired to
the armory of the drill corps and listened
to speeches by President CoJins, William
H. Schooler, George Rohe and E. J. Casey.
A NEW ORDER OF THINGS
Some Pertinent Predictons by
the Founder of Koreshan
Unity.
Dr. C. W. Teed Says the Time Is
Coming When Mortals Will
Be Immortal.
Dr. Cyrus W. Teed, the founder of
Koreshan Unity, is now in San Francisco.
Dr. Teed visited this City some six years
ago. His home is in Chicago, where he
has resided for the last ten years.
Koreshan colonies are now established
and in successful operation in Chicago and
in Florida, and between them Dr. Teed
spends most of his time.
Estero, the home of the Koreshan Unity,
on the gulf coast of Florida, is in open
possession of water communication with
DR. CYRUS W. TEED, the Koreshan, Whose Strange Doctrines
and Practices Have Been the Talk of the Continent.
[Sketched from life by a " Call " artist.]
the entire world, and the facilities for the
development of industry and trade are
equal to any on the face of the earth. It
is the purpose of Â«.he Unity to construct a
great city and to relieve the masses. It
will be laid out to contain thirty-six
square miles, and its principal avenues
will be 400 feet broad, with parks of Iruit
and nut trees extending the entire length
of the streets. There will be free homes
for the multitude, but the principle of
celibacy will be strictly observed.
Dr. Teed lectured yesterday afternoon
to an appreciative audience upon "Tne
Coming Crisis." He said in brief:
We present a scientific basis for organic
unity. Old religions ami old governments are
passing away and are t eing succeeded by new.
The laws of retrogression and progression
move along together. Jesus Christ was the
product of involution, which operates har
moniously with evolution. We Koreshans are
not like the modern scientists, atheists or
ordinary Christians.
To-day this earth is inhabited by the identi
cal men and women who inhabited it in the
time of Christ, but they are not conscious oi
it. We are upon the y. rge of a new order of
things and a new kingdom is coming. The
S m of God came here to be planted in the
race, so that he might thus subsequently pro
duce the sons of God, greater than the angels.
We can benefit humanity by our works and
only by our w^rks.
If the products of labor were to be equally
distributed to-day there would bs; a sufficiency
for ail and a surplus besides. I say 10 you
again that the time is rapidly coming when
there will be no more conflicts* between labor
and capital, when mortals shah become im
mortal and when there shall be no more sin
and no more death.
The Koreshan Unity is composed of orders,
the highest of which is the Celibate and torn
munual. This is composed of various degree<
me second order is the supreme Marital Or
der. The first principle of th.s second order
regarding the marital law, is that no member'
of the ord<-r i-hall violate the true principle of
propacative law by prostituting the marital
act. Any other purpose Â«hÂ«n that of propaga
tion is a prostitution of the net and a violation
of the true natuml marriage. Our system ot
marriage in this second order is monogamic
and according to the laws of the state and Nal
tion.
The third and most secular order of the
Unity belongs to the co-operative relation, and
includes the common marita state. All per
sons whose morals are not objectionable may
unite with this order on the basis that In
dustry shall constitute the riitht to au equi
table 6hare in the production of the industrial
unity of the organization. The object of this
order is to provide for all no wi,-h employ
ment, education and :he resources of insinstrv
in eq<!iiabie thare, the wealth <,f the individual
being proportionat to (he massâ indus ry and
economy being the assurance oi abundance.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 8, 1896.
FROM A STATE
WHERE WOMEN VOTE
Wyoming's Governor Ex
pects a Big McKin
ley Victory.
HE GIVES HIS REASONS.
It Has No More Interest in Free
Silver Than Ohio or
Indiana.
FUSIOH WAS A FAIIUKE.
The Result in 1894 Was to Give Gov.
ernor Richards a Republican
Majority of 1000
Oaklakd Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Sept. 7. J
Hon. W. A. Richards, the Republican
Governor of Wyoming, is in this city, ac
companied by his wife. They are visiting
the Governor's brother, A. C. Richards,
Assessor Dalton's chief deputy.
Governor Richards fully believes that
Wyoming will elect three Republican
electors. As she only has about
votes she is only entitled to three Presi
dential electors.
"Wyoming Is surrounded by silver
States â Colorado, Utah, Idaho and Mon
tana â and it seems to be assumed that she
will go as they go," said Governor Rich
ards to-day, "But the situation is differ
ent. In the first place Wyoming hardly
produces a single ounce of silver, and
therefore has no more direct interest in
the metal than Ohio or Indiana. It is a
wool-growing and coal-mining State, and
both wool and coal are in need of protec
tion. I know of only one wool-grower
who is not for McKinley, and he is a Dem
ocratic candidate for Congress. My im
mediate reason for believing t'.at the
Democrats cannot carry Wyoming is that
the Populists have refused to fuse with
them. The two parties fused in 1892 and
the Democrats succeeded in getting some
State offices, but the Weaver electoral
ticket was beaten, in 1894 they fused
again, and I was elected on the Republi
can ticket by 1000 votes more than the
fusion nominee.
"We believe we can carry tne State for
McKinJey, and we will leave no stone un
turned to do it. It is true we are only a
small State and have but three electoral
votes, but things might so happen that
those three votes might be necessary, and
we want to put them in the McKinley
column.
"Wyoming is not the only State in
which the supporters of Bryan may re
ceive a surprise. In Colorado, although it
will go for Bryan, there is going to be a
much larger vote for McKinley than the
Denver newspapers would like to aiimit,
and I think the Republicans may choose
the State officers. Of course Senator Tel
ler has been told by the silver men that he
will be returned to the Senate, but there
are others who have betn scheming for
many years to capture the senatorship,
and it is within the bounds of possibility
that Teller will find himself * deceived.
The upshot oi it all will be that Senator
Wolcott will emerge from the confusion
as master of the situation."
Governor Richards said be did not want
to be drawn into the woman suffrage
question, but his experience in a State
wbere women vote is interesting. Wy
oming has had woman suffrage for more
than a quarter of a century and the move
ment is not a fad any longer. The
woman's vote is not more than 20 per cent
of the whole, and a few refuse to vote, but
the majority vn:e with about the same
regularity as the men.
Mrs. Molloy, wiie of a division super
intendent upon the Union Pacific, is one
of the three Republican candidates tor
Presidential electors, but it is not the rule
for women to run for office in Wyoming.
In fact the women there have noi been
very demonstrative in politics â less so
than in Colorado, where they have en
joyed the privilege of the ballot lor so much
snorte lime. Party conventions some
times meet with only men as delegates,
ana when there are women they are few in
number. In Cheyenne there is a Woman's
Republican Club, of which Mrs. Richards
is now president, but it holds only parlor
meetings. Mrs. Richards was elected a
delegate to a recent National convention
of the Republican League of Clubs, but
she did not attend, and was not expected
to when elected.
"There are some women," said Gover
nor Richards, "who would make them
selves disagreeably prominent in politics.
but they are held in check by the others,
who say: 'These women do not represent
us, and we will not help to elect them.' It
is very noticeable that the women voters
of Wyoming want to know something
about the private or family life of a candi
date for office, and wiil not cast their bal
lots for one who is reported to treat his
wife and children in other than a com
mendable way. I think that would be
one of the most pronounced results of
woman suffrage everywhere."
SPANISH-AMERICANS.
Ex-Governor R. Pacheco and A. D.
Spltvalo Speak at Cali
fornia Hall.
The Spanish - American Republican
League, of which R. R. Duckworth is
chairman and A. de la Torre Jr. the secre
tary, held a large and enthusiastic meet
ing last evening at California Hall. Nearly
500 people were present, ladies being rep
resented in large numbers. A very good
musical and literary programme was ren
dered.
Hon. Romnaldo Pacheoo, ex-Governor
of California, spoke at length on the issues
of the campaign. Next followed Hon.
A. D. Splivalo, who rendered an eloquent
address.
The following persons took part in the
evening's entertainment: Selection, Pro
fessor Luciano Mojica and orchestra; song,
Misa Lulu Flemming; recitation, James
Feeiey; piccolo solo, M. M. Nava; song,
T. Kelly.
The Phcenbr Republican Club, the Con
tinental Lea: ue and the Afro-American
Club were well represented at the meet
ing. During the evening an autograph
letter was received by the chairman from
William McKinley, thanking the Spanish-
American Republican League for its good
work for the party and wishing thÂ« organ
ization the greatest success.
In conclusion the meeting adjourned
with three cheers for McKinley and Ho
bart.
McKinley Rally.
OAKLAND, Cal., Sept. 7.â Ex-Mayor
W. R. Davis, who has spoken at Liver
more each campaign for the past ten
years, is greatly pleased with the openingi ng
of the campaign in that place Saturday
night. "Inevt-rsaw the equal." said he
to-day, "the laboring man, the farmer, the
merchant and the ladies turned out en
masse and gave the speakers a royal wel
come. The hall was crowded to the
utmost, and many remained standing
until the last word was spoken. That
shows genuine interest in the campaign."
The Drill Corps
ALAMEDA, Cal., Sept. 7.â The Ala
meda Republican Drill Corps has forty
one charter members at the present time,
some ot whom are Democrats who will
vote for McKinley and protection. The
ciub will have a meeting Saturday night.
It is expected that this organization will
attend rallies at Haywards, Sail Jose and
San Francisco during the campaign. It
will also assist in caring for the Republi
can County Convention, which meets here
on Monday, September 21.
ASTRAL PHOTOGRAPHY,
Dr. Jerome Anderson Gives a
Theosophic Explanation of
the Art.
Able and Lucid Presentation ot a Sub
ject Replete With Absorbing
in; Interest
"Theosophy has never doubted the fact
that an astral model may by thought
power be precipitated upon a semi-astral
surface, such as a sensitized film."
Thus did Dr. Jerome Anderson sum up
the theosophic view of mental photography
after reading the article, "The Picture of
a Thought," published in yesterday's
issue of The Call.
"Paracelsus says," went on the doctor,
"that the trained will is the beginning of
all magic This saying, for theosophists,
means a great deal, since it gives the key
to much that would otherwise be and re
main concealed from human knowledge.
The possessor of one of these 'trained
wills' we call an 'adept.' In modern
times Mme. Blavatsky was perhaps the
best-known representative of this privi
leged class among Western peoples.
"To delineate the theosophic mode of
dealing with the interesting subject of
Professor Jordan's paper, it will be neces
sary to recollect that matter has various
degrees. A stone or a chunk of meat is
physical, pure and simple; a film or a
nerve pulp is semi-astral, while a yet
higher type of matter imperceptible to
the ordinary human perceptions is that
known as the astral.
"This conception may perhaps be ren
dered a little clearer by an illustration.
If a pendulum be swung to and fro until
it reach a velocity of thirteen vibrations
to the second, the result will be a musical
note, low in pitch and weak in volume.
Increase the vibration and the note will
ascend in pitch and become louder. Wi en
a speed of several thousand vibrations per
second shall huve been reached, the pitch
will ascend beyond the reach of the sense
of hearing, and a seeming silence wiil
ensue.
"Increase the velocity of the vibrations
vastly more, and when a speed of several
trillions of vibrations per second shall
have been attained, light will appear,
first red and then the other colors of the
spectrum in their order as the velocity in
creases, until at last a colorless radiance
supervenes. Whatever other manifesta
tions may subsequently appear will be of
the astral order, and imperceptible to the
normal senses.
"That is, mutatis mutandis, the history
of matter. The lowest plane of astral
matter is that which lies just above the
sense of sight. Pure astral matter is so
much finer than the physical that it takes
form almost instantaneously at the bid
ding oi thought. These forms ot astral
matter are perfectly capable of being pho
tographed upon semi-astral substances,
Buch as the gelatine of a sensitized plate.
They are precipitated upon the plate by the
will of the operator in a manner exactly
simi ar to that in which Mme. Blavatsty
could by her superior will power, precipi
tate color upon ordinary physical matter,
for example, cardboard or paper.
"That Mme. Blavat-ky did produce
Eictures in this manner is undisputable.
ev^ial of these pictures are in existence
to-day and I hope one of these days to see
one. An adept can easily form a model
in astral matter by the power of thought,
and it would seem that the model almost
Instantly fills with physical atoms, which
flow into it as into a mold, thereby giv
ing it visible form. This is the art of
a>trai statuary, or, in plain English, the
whole secret of 'materialization' as prac
ticed by so-called spirit mediums.
"The whole subject is one of the most
absorbing interest, and I am glad to see
that it appears to awaken puoiic interest.
The truths of theosophy can all be worked
out by a thinking mind, and when once
learned furnish the clew to many mys
teries."
Spillane Away Ahead.
The contest for the most popular captain of
the police force has no lack of interest.
The votes counted yesterday afternoon at
6 o'clock shows Captain John Splllane of the
tobom-street station to be in the lead by a
handsome majority. The vote wa>: I. W.
Lees, 255; A. J. Dunlev ,417; John Spillane,

BRYAN IN THE SOUTH,
Governor Oates Says He Will
Lose Kentucky and the
Two Virginias.
Fusion of the Republicans and Gold
Democrats on Congressmen â The
Populist Vote.
Governor William C. Oates of Alabama
is at the Lick. For the past two or three
days he has been visiting his wife and
children at the residence o f his brother,
ex-District Attorney J. W. Oates, at Santa
Rosa.
Governor Oates is a lar?e man and has
his right sleeve empty. He has a heavy
gray mustache and gray hair. He served
fourteen years In Congress, was elected
Governor two years ago, and refused to
take the nomination again. His succes
sor, General Joseph F. Johnston, was
elected in August and will take the office
in December.
The Governor says he thinks the electo
ral ticket in Alabama will be for Bryan,
though in that State, as in others of the
South, the gold Democrats and Repub'.i
cans are fusing on Congressmen and Mc-
Kinley. On this account things are con
siderably chopped up. They are nominat
ing Congressmen in every district.
"I think McKinley will get Kentucky
and the two Virginias," said he. "Ken
tucky certainly, because General Buck
ner, who has been nominated for Vice-
President by the gold Democrats, is a very
popular man. He wiil eet votes enough
to split the ticket and give the State to
McKinley. That, of course, is- just what
the gold Democrats want to accomplish.
"As for me I will vote for Bryan, though
there are some things in hid platform 1
don't like, and some things he has done
himself 1 don't like. I think Bryan will
carry the South with the exceptions I have
named. He will get Louisiana, the matter
of sugar protection not being strong
enough to prevent it. The Populists of
the South will generally vote for Bryan I
think.
"Ordinarily I would say that McKinley
would win, taking the Nation over, as it
now appears, providing that the same
conditions exist as in former years. There
ought to be no doubt against it. But if
this opposition against money is general
and in the nature of a revolution then
Bryan will go in. It is pretty hard to tell
the way things now looK."
LEON DENN BY ATTACHED.
John Bi-rgez Brings Suit on Notes
Signed by the Kx-Politiclan=
Sheriff Whelan took possession of three
pieces of property belonging to Leon
Dennery yesterday in a peculiar suit that
was filed In the Superior Court by tne at
torneys of John Bergez, the restaurant
man. The friends of the ex-politician will
probably be surprised to know that the
complaint calls him Leon Dennery or
B. Alexander and that the complaining
witness tells a queer story regarding the
suit, which is to recover $350 67 claimed to
be due on two promissory notes.
The properties attached by the real
estate deputy of the Sheriff's office are on
Clay street, near Pierce, Eleventh, near
Clement, and Washington, near Brod
