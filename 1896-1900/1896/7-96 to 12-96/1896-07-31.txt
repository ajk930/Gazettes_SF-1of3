ATLANTIC CITY. N. J., July 30.â A
terrible railroad cat. rophe took place on
the Meadows, about two miles out of this
city, shortly after 6:30 r. m., resulting in
the death of forty-two people, so far as
can' now be learned, and the wounding of
eighty others. A train left here consisting
of seven cars over the West .Jersey Rail
road, bearing* a special excursion Â°of Red
Men and their friends of Bridgeton, N. J.,'
and Salem, and had reached the crossing
of the Reading Railroad when it was i
struck by the 5:40 down express from
Philadelphia, demciishing two cars and
telescoping the two following.
The engine of the Reading train became
a total wreck, killing the engineer and
fatally injuring the fireman and the car
behind it also was thrown from the tract
and many of its occupants killed or in
jured.
The list of the identified dead is:
Mb. and Mbs. Tbenchard, Bridgeton.
Edwarp Farb, engineer of the Reading
train, Atlantic City.
Samuel Thobn, baggageman, Atlantic
Citr.
P. S. Wprpht, MiliTille, N. J.

Johj^G reiner, Bridgeton.
Charles Ackler, Saiem. c
; Charles McGar, Bridgeton.
JFr'anklin J3ubois, Woodruff, N. J.
â¢Mrs J. Earnest, Bridgeton.
'â¢â¢jThi responsibility of the collision has
not yet been placed, but William Thurlow,
the operator at the block-tower situated
ax the crossing, has o been placed under
arrest by order of the Coroner. â¢
. Leaving this city the tracks of the West
Jersey road run parallel to those pf the
Camden and Atlantic until after they
cross tb!e drawbridge, whÂ°en they switch
off to the south, .crossing the Reading at
an obtuse angle.
John Grenier t the engineer of the^West
Jersey train, saw the Reading tr^ain ap
proaching the crossing at a swift speed,
.but asÂ° the Jignals were, open for him
to proceed on his wÂ°ay he cont inned t His
engine had barely cleared the track of the
Reading when the Idcomothe ol the lat
ter train, whicV left -Philadelphia at 5:40
F. M.^ struckothe first car full in the center,
throwing it far off the tract into a ditch
near by, in which it was completely sub
merged.
V The second car of the West Jersey train
was jOao carried into theoditch, the â¢ third
and fourth being telescoped. The engine
of the Reading train' was thrown to the
other side of the track, carrying mth it
the first coach.
A few minutes after the collision, to add
to the horror of the situation, the boiler
of the Reading locomotive exploded,
scalding several to death and casting its
boiling spray ovet many of the injured
passengers, as soon as the news reached
this city it spread broadcast and thous
ands of people flocked to the scene. o* Â°
Tberoad leading Â°to the place of the col
lision was a constant procession of hacks,
'busSs and bicycles and all kinds of vehi
cles, while thousands of pedestrians hur
ried along the path to render what assist
ance they could or to satisfy their curi
osity.
Darkness quickly fell, and the work of
rescuing the injured and recovering the
dead bodies was carried out under the
lurid clare of huge bonfires.
It was a gruesome sight presented to on
lookers as the mangled and burnt forms of
the dead were carried from the wreckage
which bound them and laid side by side
on the gravel bank near the track with no
other pall than the tew old newspapers
gathered from the passengers.
The wounded were quickly gathered to
gether and carried by train and wagon to
the Atlantic "City Hospital, where six of
them died shortly after their arrival. The
old excursion -house at the foot of Missis
sippi avenue was converted intoa morgue,
and thither the dead were taken.
At a late hour this evening there were
twenty-nine bodies laid out there, few
of which had teen identified.
This city was terribly excited over the
accident. ThÂ« streets in the vicinity of
The San Francisco Call.
the excursion-house and the City Hospital,
as well as the road leading to the scene of
â¢the accident, were packed with people
anxious to learn the last news.
â¢The Bridgeton and Salem excursionists
who escaped injury were brought back to
this cky and sent home on a special train
several hours later in the evening.
James" Hoy t, secretary of the Depart-'
ment of Public Safety, immediately upon
learning the extent of the catastrophe,
telegraphed for the j Philadelphia Emer
gency Corps, 150 of whom responded and
hurried to this city on a special train,
which left Philadelphia at 10:45. These
surgeons materially aided the volunteer
corps of this city, wnich embraced almost
every physician at present within its con
fines. _.. Many of the injured were taken to
hotels, as the City Hospital soon became
overcrowded. , About thirty of the wounded
had their injuries dressed and were able
to proceed on .their way. It is* expected
that fully a dozen. of those now lying in
the hospital will not survive their injuries.
Mrs. Edward Farr,* the wife of the Read
ing . engineer who met death while : per
forming, hi* duty' .tnd, --a* found with
one hand on the throttle arid the other on
the braxe, when informed of ' the accident
and her husband's tragic death, was una

SAN FRANCISCO, FRIDAY MORNING, JULY 31, 1896.
Charles C. Rynick of Bridgeton, who
was in the excursion party, was in one
of the chaircars. He escaped wit,h severe
bruises, and so far as his agitation would
permit, told the story of hte experience.
"When we saw that a collision was un
avoidable," be said, "the scene in our
car was terrific. Women f-i n ted, and men
rushed in a mad panic for the door; but
it came almost before we had time to
think.
"One car was cut right in two and the
lower portion of it lifted bodily from the
track arid tumbled over. Every car was
crowded and it is horrible to think of the
number who musr be lying under those
ruins*
â¢The roof of one of the cars fell in a mass
and everybody in that car was buried un
der it. It simply dropped on top of the
people. I know positively of two in our
car who were killed. They were Mr. and
Mrs. Frank Bell of Bridgeton.
"Their daughter was in another car fur
ther back and was not hurt. I don't
know who is to blame. When we were
about two miles from Atlantic City we
came to a stop out in the meadows and
stayed there for several minutes, but I
don't know why.
"I think there must have been fully
eighty killed. The only person with me
was my six-year-old son, and he was not
hurt, thank God."

ST. JOHNB, Newfocsdland, July 30.â
Sir Archibald G.ikie, director-general
of the British Geological Survey, states
in a letter to Joseph Chamberlain, .British
Colonial Secretary, that the Newfound
land coal and iron deposits are immensely
valuable. Bir Archibald advises the ap

upon the size and character of the de
posits, giving general particulars retard
ing them, with a view to tneir develop

British warships and every effort will be
made to induce British capitalists to in

HOUSES WASHED AWAY
Crops Destroyed and Farmers
Left on the Verge of
Starvation.
WIDESPREAD DESTRUCTION.
Cloudbursts Fo low Long Spells of
Rainy Weather and Swell
the Waterways.
NEW YORK, N. V., July 30.â A special j
to the Tribune from Parkersourg, W. Va.,
says:
The news of another cloudburst, and by
far the most destructive which has oc
curred in this State in the last month,
reached here yesterday. Tiiis time the
scene of destruction was In Calhoun
County, in the central part of the State, in
tne territory bordering on Steer, Yellow
and Straight creeks.
The elements broke loose with terrific
force, flooding the entire country with a
deluge oi water ten feet deep. The three
creeks swelled to enormous proportions,
and hardly a building of any kind remains
to mark the course of the streams.
Three fatalities a c reported. Mrs.
Woofter and her daughter and Sarah
Stephen*, in their efforts to save their
household â¢ffacta. wara carried away in
their own homes and drowned. Mrs.
Woofter and her daughter were awakened
from their sleep to hear the rush of the
waters, and upon finding their bed sur
rounded by water made an attempt to save
themselves from drowning by placing the
organ on top of the table and taking refuge
there, but the waters rapidly rose to their
position and they were drowned like rats.
The house was torn from its foundation
and carried a considerable distance away.
Sarah Stephens, an elderly woman and
alone in her room, met her fate in a simi
lar manner.
On Yellow Greek four houses and a saw
mill were carried the entire course of tne
stream. Several booms containing thou
sands of iogn were forced from their moor
ings. There is not even a fence to be seen
to mark off the division of the farm lands.
The scene of this disaster is in the
wilds of West Virginia, where there are
neither telegraphic communications nor
railroads. It is a poor class of people that
makes up the population and they are
without a single pose^sion. All the crops
were destroyed, leaving them without
food. Unless assistance can be sent to
them starvation will follow. A heavy
rain continues to flood the country, and
until this ceases it will be impossible to
transport anything to the scene of the
disaster. Farmers wno were in good cir
cumstances last week are penniless to
day. The State has never met witn suoh
a calamity before. To estimate the loss is
impossible.
â This is the fifth cloudburst occurring in
this State during the last month, each
one being worse than the former. Entire
reconstruction was necessary on the Balti
more and Ohio Railroad for a distance of
fifty miles. Traffic was resumed yesterday
afternoon after a suspension of four days.
The Ohio River at this point continues
to rise and a flood in Parkersburg is inevi
table. A stage of thirty-fire feet has been
reached and by to-morrow the lower part
of the city will be under water.
ATHENS, Ohio, July 30.â The most de
structive storm in the history of Sunday
Creek Valley swept down on Glouster, a
mining town twelve miles north of here,
last night, which resulted in the loss of
fifteen lives and the almost total destruc
tion of one of the principal streets of the
town, and doing damage in other places to
the amount of thousands of dollars. Build
ings were toppled over, trees torn from
their roots, and the town this morning is
a scene of desolation.
J. L. Daugnerty was struck by a section
of a plank walk and instantly killed. Four
others are reported dead and several
others seriously injured. The details are
meager yet.
A livery stable, with six horses and a
number of vehicles, was blown into the
creek and swept away. The streets are
covered with broken timbers and debris of
all kinds. To add to the horror Sunday
Creek is sweeping everything before it.
The list of dead will reach fifteen.
WHEELING, W. Va., July 30.-Heavy
rain this morning caused immense damage
to property in this vicinity. The small
creeks became raging torrents and bridges
were swept away. Farmhouses were
flooded and crops irreparably damaged.
SPRINGFIELD. Ohio, July 30.-The
worst storm that has visited this vicinity
in years occurred last evenine. The finan
cial loss will amount to $50,000. Sixteen
houses were unroofed and otherwise
damaged. Henry Dipple, night watch
man, was electrocuted by loose wire. At
Lawrencebnrg, Tremont, Paris and other
small places farmers report great damage
to fruit and grain crops.
BTEUBENVILLE, Ohio, July 10.â Two
hundred neople of this vicinity are home
less to-night as the result of a cloudburst,
which occurred this afternoon in the west
era part of this city. The people in th
lowlands, alarmed by the recent flood^
were prepared for disaster and fled to tht
hills, thus no lives were lost, although
many were- in imminent danger. Warn
ing waa also given by a party of men who
bad been on watch and ran down the
valley shouting that the flood was coming.
When the houses in the track of the
angry waters were reached they went
down as though built of card
board. Thirty or forty residences were
wrecked, the chief sufferers being Rebecca
Philabaum, William Risden, Robert
Ritchie, James Burdes, Andrew Albaueh,
Benjamin Wise, Grant Stroud, John Hart
and Henry Bowman. The latter was pro
prietor of a store, which, with all its stock,
is gone.
Two culverts of the Panhandle road were
carried away, and at Gould's there is
650 xeet of track washed out. No trains are
running, and it will take twenty-four
Hours to repair the damage.
PORTLAND, Ohio. July 30. â During
last night's storm 1.75 inches of rain fell
in 45 minutes. A high wind accompanied
the rain and did great damage to crops.
The oil fields also suffered greatly, many
derricks being prostrated.

President Cleveland Is Out
With a Rather Pointed
Proclamation.
SAJS NEUTRALITY LAWS
ARE VIOLATED.
Strict Enforcement Threatened
in Order to Check the Sym
pathy for Cuba.
SPAIN HAS A TRUSTED FRIEND
IN THE PRESIDENT.
Executive Officers - Called Upon to
Exert Vigilance in Punishing
Offenders.
WASHINGTON, D. C, July 30.â The
following proclamation was issued from
the State Department this afternoon:
BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES Of
AMERICAâ A PROCLAMATION.
Whereas, Br a proclamation dated the 12th
of June, A. D. 1895. attention was called to the
serious civil disturbances accompanied by
armed -esiitance to the established Govern
ment of Spain then prevailing in the island of
Cuba, and citizens of the United States and all
other persons were admonished to abstain
from taking part in such disturbance in con
travention of the neutrality laws of '.he United
States; and whereas, said civil disturbances
and armed resistance to tne authority of
Spain, with which the United States is on
terms of peace and amity, continue to preval
In said island of Cuba; and whereas, since the
date of said proclamation said neutrality laws
of the United States have been the subject of
authorized exposition by the judicial tribunal
of last resort, and it has thus been declared
that any combination of persons organized in
the United states for the purpose of proceed
ing to its making war upon a foreign country
with wnich the United States is at peace, and
provided with arms to De used for such pur
pose, constitutes a "military expedition or en
terprise," within the meaning of said neutral
ity lavs, and that the providing or preparing
oi the meanS for such "military expedition or
enterprise," which is expressly prohibited by
said laws, includes furnishing or aiding in
transportation tor such "military .expedition
or enterprise" ; and whereas, by express enact
ment, if two or more persons conspire to com
mit an offense against the United States, any
act of one conspirator to effect the necessary
object of such conspiracy renders all
the conspirators liable to fine and
imprisonment; and whereas, there is
reason to believe that citizens of
the United States and others within its
jurisdiction fail to apprehend the meaning
and operation of the neutrality laws of the
United States as authoritatively interpreted ai
aforesaid, and may be misled into participa
tion under the transactions which are viola
lions of said laws, and will render them liable
to the severe penalties provided for such viola
tions.
Now, therefore, that the laws above referred
to as judicially construed may be duly
executed; that the obligations of the
United States may be fully satisfied, and that
their citizens and all others within their juris
diction, being seasonably apprised of their
legal duty in the premises, may abstain from
disobedience to the laws of the United States,
and thereby escape the forfeitures and penal
ties legally consequent thereon, I, Grover
Cleveland, President of the United States, do
hereby solemnly warn a.ll citizens of the
United States and all others within their
jurisdiction against violations of said laws in
terpreted as hereinbefore explained, and give
notice that all such violations will be vigor
ously prosecuted. And I do hereby invoke
the co-nperstion of all good citizens in the
enforcement of said laws and in the detention
aud apprehension of any offenders against tha
same, and do hereby enjoin upon all the ex
ecutive officers to exert the utmost vigilance
in preventing, prosecuting and punishing any
infractions thereof.
In testimony whereof I have hereunto set
my hand and caused the seal of the United
States to be affixed.
Done at the city of Washington this 27th
day of July, in the year of our Lord one thou
sand eight hundred and ninety-six, and of tho
independence of the United States the one
hundred and twenty-first
Grover Cleveland.
By the President: Richard Olnky,
Secretary of State.
The President's warning proclamation
as to Cuban filibusters is understood to
be one of the results of Secretary Olney's
recent visit to Gray Gables and is thought
to be in some measure at least, the answer
of the administration to the petitions and
complaints against Spain's treatment of
Americana in Cuba, which continually
pour in on the State Department. Many
of these have contained pleas of ignorance
of the laws under which the suspects were
arrested and imprisoned, and it has ap
parently been deemed advisable to leave
1 American citizens no loneer in doubt as
! to the protection they may expect if tbev
Â£O so far in their pympatbies as to violate
United States statutes.
CONEPIRACS ON PLANS INLE.
Men Iteporttd From Cuba Formed a Plot
to Return.
HAVANA, Cttba, July 30.â The latest
details of the uprising among the political
prisoners on the Isle of Pines show that
250 people who had been deported from
Cuba were engaged in the conspiracy.
They had partially succeeded in their
plan of making away with Colonel Berrin,
the Governor of the island, having over
powered and bound him preparatory to
hanging him, when they were interrupted
in their work by a patrol which was pass
ing and which rescued the Governor from
tbeir hands.
The plotters intended to gain possession
of the capital of the island and to capture
the Spanish gunboat Fradeva, on board of
whicn they proposed to cross to Cuba,
about fifty miles away, and join the in
surgents.
When the revolters found that their
scheme had miscarried all who could get
away fled to the woods in the interior of
the island. The authorities express conn2
dence that all of those who took part in
the uprising will eventually be captured.
rnÂ«wrven<Â« Defeated.
HAVANA, Cuiu, July 20.â Colonel Per

ish loss was one killed and three lieuten
ants and fourteen privates wounded.
DESTRUCTION OF A WARSHIP.

plonion â¢/ HÂ«r Magazine.
ROME, Italy, July 30.â During a heavy
thunderstorm the coast - defense ship
Roma of the Italian navy was struck by
lightning. The most serious result of the
thunderbolt was that the warship was set
on fire.
The flames spread quickly despite the
utmost exertions of the crew. They stuck
to the ship, fighting every inch, until the
tire had nearly reached the powder maga
zine and it was realized tnat the vessel
was certainly doomed.

given out. As Mr. Dawes said: "It is
getting to be a matter of bu>iness now, and
we cannot disclose our plan of campaign
to the enemy."
Mr. Leland of Kansas will be the first
memberofrthe committee to leave Chicago,
having to return home in a day or two as
chairman of the State committee to attend
the Republican Sta.e Convention.
The committee called into conference
this afternoon Mr. Goldsmith of Milwau
kee, who has charge of the German educa
tional work, and the result is that this
branch of the committee will begin send
ing out literature in a few days.
The published story of the removal of
the headquarters from Chicago to Cleve
land, because of alleged factional fighting
between the machine men in Cook County
in Illinois and the original McKinley men
and the friction between the State and
National committees, was vigorously
and generally denied by the head
quarters officials as without founda
tion. Chief Haiin of the speakers'
department to-day made the following
assignments for Roswell G. Horr in Ne
braska: Lincoln, August 5; York, Au
gust 6; Hastings, August 7; Kearney,
August 8; Nqrfolk, August 10; Omaha,
August 11.
". Mr. Heath has now sent to press twenty
six campaign documents, nearly ail of
them bearing directly or indirectly on the
money question. Those on the tariff will
not he out for two weeks or more.
â¢ "The first leaflets on sound money were
received from the printers to-day and the
work of distribution begun. Mr. Heath
has signed orders for 9,000,000 copies of
anti-silver literature and five orders for

Senator Thurston was about the head
quarters most of the day priming himself
for the opening of the Western campaign
at Madison, Wis., to-morrow afternoon,
under the auspices of the Monona Assem
bly. He left at* 6:30 for the scene of his
first effort, saying that his, head was so
full of campaign ideas and arguments that
j he was worrying to know how he could

I logical shape. After he had made a dozen
speeches he would leel more at his ease
and could prepare them in advance.

DR. JAMESON'S CONVICTION.
I The Home Secretary Did Not Order That
the Raiders Be Treated as First
. â¢ m .class Misdemeanants.
LONDON, Eng., July 30.â The unofficial
'report circulated last evening to the effect
that Sir Matthew White Ridgley, the
Home Secretary, had ordered that Dr.
Jameson and; the ether prisoners, ;who
were sentenced to various terms of im
" prisonment for the part they took in the
i Transvaal raid, should be treated as first
class misdemeanants, turns out to have
been incorrect.
In the House of Commons to-day,
Patrick O'Brien, ParnelliU member for
the city of Kilkenny, asked for informa
tion on the subject, which was furnished
by tbe Home Secretary. Sir Matthew
said that the court alone had the power to
order tha prisoners to be treated as nrat
j class misdemeanants.
No such order has been issued by tbe
court, and hence tbe convicted men would
be treated aa ordinary prisoners. In re
sponse to a further question he said that
be was unable to state at present whether
the royal prerogative would be exercised
and ail order issued in the name of the
Queen for (he treatment of the prisoners
as first-class misdemeanants.
The preliminary step for an inquiry into
the administration of the British South
Africa Company was then taken up by the
Right Honorable Joseph Chamberlain,
Secretary of State for the Colonies, who
made a motion for the appointment of a

RELISING IN ARREST.
Capture of a, Minitt-r Whose Mania for
Gambling Led to frengy.
COUNCIL BLUFFS, lowa, July 30. -A
mau of clerical appearance and giving tbe
name of J. F. Bard was arrested to-night
in the Turf Exchange gambling-bouse, in
this city, on ihe charge of forgery com
mitted in Omaha. In his possession were
found testimonials to his character and
standing of a minister of the gospel in
San Francisco and Portland, Or. He
said he had been a minister of the
Christian church in Portland, where he
now has a wife. and crown children.
Some time ago he started on a trip
East and en route went to Cripple Creek.
He became interested in stock specula
tion and finally drifted into aÂ»pambling
house. where he became infatuated wiih
gambling and seemed unable to quit it.
He was finally penniless and thrown out.
IHe then made his way eastward, visiting
various towns and gambling wherever he
could. When he could get money no
other way he resorted to forging checks,
'which he cashed. He expressed relief at
his arrest and he hoped it would finally re
lease him from the mania for gambling
which had taken possession of him.

WILL PROTECT SETTLER
New Patents to Be Issued for
Lands Erroneously Sold
by Railroads.
The Union Pacific Company Agrees to
Pay the Cost of All Addi
tibnal Suits.
i j _____
â  WASHINGTON, D. C, July SO.â The
United States officials have taken im
portant action In regard to the Union
Pacific Railroad lands. The Secretary of
the Interior recommended to Attorney-
General Harmon the dismissal of a number
of suits now pending in the United States
courts of Nebraska, Wyoming, Colorado
and Utah against the Union Paciflo and
about 10,000 settlers along the line of the
road to recover title to lands said to have
been erroneously patented to the company.
These lands were supposed to be em â¢
braced within the limits of the grant
made by Congress to the company and
were patented to it some years- ago. The
settlers whose title homesteads have since
been, la litigation purchased their land
from the company and secured the neces
sary patents. But, the land.' office Â£ad,
after issuing .the patents, made . trie . tHS
cision that, they were worthless, a* Wj
company, as the land office claimed, was
not entitled to the lands deeded, and,
therefore, certification had been erroneous.
Then the Interior , Department began
suit to recover these lands. Under the law
in force prior to March 3, 1896. it wa3
necessary, in order that title could be re
covered, to include the settlers as defend
ants in these suits. The act passed on the
date above named, however, provides that
the Government might enter suit against
the railroad company for the value of the
lands found to have been erroneously cer
tified and that innocent purchasers from
the railway company might receive new
patents upon filing- proof that they were
innocent purchasers.
General Solicitor Kelly of the Union Pa
cific Company has been in Washington for
several days, and has agreed, on behalf of
the company, to pay the cost of the pres
ent suit ana thus relieve the settlers of all
expenses.
If the Attorney-General approves the
recommendation of the Interior Depart
ment (as it ib believed he will) the present
suits will be dismissed and new suits will
he brought against the company alone to
recover the value of land. Meantime, pat
ents will be issued to the settlers upon
their filing the proof required by the act
of March 3, 1896, "and they will thus be
quieted in their, title.

aged to-day :to put aside the disputes
which have characterized the former pro
ceedings and transact a little business,
the first of the session, aside from fight
ing over the question of the admission of
anarchists.
The session to-day was presided over by
Signor Ferreri, an Italian delegate. After

of M. Deiory, the Socialist mayor of Lille,
France, who was suspended from office
for having been concerned ,in the recent
rioting in city on the occasion of the
arrival there of German delegates to a So
cialist congress.
The writer of the paper contended that
it was the first duty of the Socialists to
organize the agrarian; proletariat and to
continue the efforts : for the amelioration
of their condition until the .land' should
be cultivated by society in a co-operative
capacity. * He J held "that it was left to
every nation to formulate the beat means
to attain this end. : A discussion ;oa the
paper followed.

PREPARING FOR
A THIRD TICKET,
Meeting of the Provisional
Sound-Money Committee
Called.
STATES ARE ORGANIZING
Representative Democrats of
Many Sections to Attend
the Convention.
THE CANDIDATES MENTIONED.
Assurances That the Public Will See
the Fallacy of the Free-Silver
Movimnt.
CHICAGO. 111., July 30.â Chairman
Bragg to-day called a meeting of tbe i>io
visional National executive committee of
the sound-money Democracy at the
Palmer House next Saturday to consider
the work done by the sub-committee on
State organization and selection of the
remaining National committeemen for
the Indianapolis meeting. Several more
States reported to-day by telegraph that
they had been partly organized for the new
movement.
George Wochs of Chattanooga tele
graphed: '.'Active steps for a third ticket
are now under way. Tennessee sound
money Democrats are in earnest and will
be at Indianapolis."
Hon. J. F. Provine, a prominent Demo
crat of Coffeyville, Miss., sent word: "The
third ticket will have some support here."
Ex-Btate Senator C. B. PendJeton of Key
West sent a message to say that Colonel
Shipley, a candidate for tbe United States
Senate, who had thrown cold water on the
movement in Florida, was mistaken, and
adding that gold Democrats were
numerous in tbat State.
William Everett of Quincy, Mass., wrote:
"I believe J. Sterling Morton is the man
for President. He is sound on gold; he is
sound on the tariff; he is a devoted civil
service reformer. He is for economy; he
knows every part of the country aud lie
represents the administration."
J. J. Hussler, United States Lmd Agent
at Enid, O. T., wrote to say that he would
go as a delegate from the Territory to the
convention, and believed the movement
was the only way to "kill the silver craze."
C. V. Holman of Rockiand, Me., who is
almost daily heard from, wired: "Re
ceiving enthusiastic responses from all
over Maine."
Hon. J. A- Faulkner has been designated
as the provisional member of the National
Committee from Alabama.
Hon. J. Van Alen of Newport. R. 1.,
who was ..ominated by President Cleve
land for the Italian Mission, wired tbat he
would do everything in his power with
other thiyi-ticKet Democrats of Rhode
Island.
Edward Atkinson, the Boston writer on
political economy, wrote to General Bragg,
offering his services as a speaker for the
third ticket. He said: "Although I am
nearly 70, I am strongly inclined to come
out West ia October to make a few
speeches."
The sound money Democrats of Mich
igan telegraphed that John S. Lawrence of
Grand Rapids had been named as the pro
visional committeeman.
Ex-Congressman William S. Forman of
East St. Louis, a member of the Illinois
executive committee, arrived to-day. He
said: "It seems to me the Democratic
sound money men should be given some
thing to cling to until this free silver
craze has had its run. Free silver will not
win. The American people will see
through tbat fallacy before election day.
Of course, this new ticket movement will
help McKinley, but it is in the Nation's
interest. I am for a Western man for
President, Senator Palmer and William R.
Morrison. '"
KANSAS CITY, Mo., July 30.â Two hun
dred or more sound-money Democrats met
at the Coates House to-night and perfected
the organization of the National Demo
cratic Club of Jackson County, with Judge
Black as president. Judge Krauthoff, who
represented Missouri at the Chicago con
ference, made a report. Cleveland's name
was wildly cheered. A township organiza
tion of Kansas City and the county will be
at once undertaken.
MARSHA LLTOWN, lowa, July 30.â A
conference of sound - money Democrats
haa been called to meet at Das Moines on
August 5 to seiect a State committeeman
to attend the conference in Indianapolis.
NOMINEE BRIAN PRESENT.
That the Only Interesting Feature of a
Democratic Committee Meeting.
LINCOLN, Nebb., July 30.â A meeting
at the Lincoln Hoiel to-night of the Dem
ocratic State Central Committee was made
interesting by the presence of Nominee
Bryan. Ostensibly the meeting was called
merely for the purpose of fixing tha date
for the State Convention of the party, but
the general understanding was that the
situation in the State was to be discussed
wiih a view of determining the strength
of the Bryan and SewaM forces, and also to
consider the question of fusion with the
Populists. Yesterday's county conven
tions of the Populists indicated the desire
of that party in Nebraska to support
Bryan and Bowall in exchange for the
Democratic indorsement of most of the
Populist candidates for State offices, and
it was the prevailing impression thai Mr.
Bryan was wanted to give his views on
that point. It should be said, however,
that Mr. Bryan had decided to attend the
meeting more than a week ago.
It was 8:30 o'clock before the committee
assembled. Mr. Bryan did not appear at
the Lincoln until that hour, ana out of
courtesy to him the committee was not
called to order prior to hi* arrival. He
was immediately surrounded by commit
teeman and had plenty of handshaking
for a few minutes.
This was a busy day at the candidate's
residence, for in addition to members of
the Democratic State Committee he bad
numerous other callers. At luncheon Mr.
and Mrs. Bryan had as their guest C. A.
Walsh of Ottumwa, lowa, the temporary
secretary of the Democratic National
Committee.
The committee spent an hour and a
half listening to repoits from its mem
bers as to the prospects for a Democratic
victory in their various districts. Quite a
rosy view was given by most of the
speakers In substauc* the testimony was
to the effect that the defection from the
ranks of the party in the State was too
small to be considered, while a number of
tbe conimitteemen told of Republicans
who had joined Bryan clubs or who had
otherwise declared for the Chicago ticket.
Many of those who made reports admit
ted that the German population of Ne
braska seemed unfavorable to free coinage.
It was claimed that this was due prin
cipally to the fact that nearly all the Ger
man newspapers are for gold, and sug
gestions were made t at German speak
ers and silver campaign literature in
German should be sent to the towns and
settlements having a large population
from the fatherland. Some reference was
made to the Bohemian vote, mostly favor
able to the Democratic ticket
Among those who addressed the com
mittee were Judge Ambrose and Judge
Duffy, formerly on the district bench of
thÂ« State. Judge Ambrose said he had
been a Republican all his life, but had
parted company with that political faith.
He had always been taught to believe that
the Republican party was for bimetallism,
he aaid, but he had found out his mistake
and placed himself in the hands of the
central committee to do its bidding on the
stump or in any other capacity. Judge
Duffy admitted that while a Republican
most of his life he had voted for Cleveland
and he was now ready to take off his coat
and work for the election of Bryanl
Mr. Bryan took no part in .this discus
sion, and when it was concluded he and
the other members of the committee, after
those who had attended the meeting by
courtesy had withdrawn, held an executive
session to talk over the executive work of
the campaign.
Mr. Bryan remained with the commit
tee a few minutes only. He made a few
remarks concerning tbe necessity forpartv
work and then withdrew and went home.
The committee talked incidentally over
the question of fusion with Populists, but
came to no conclusion. Omaha was se
lected as ihe place for holding the State
Convention. The date was left to the ex
ecutive committee for arrangements, aud
the sentiment expressed in debate exhib
ited a desire to have it after the Populist
and Congressional conventions had taken
place. It will probably occur during the
last wee* in August.
TOM WAT SON'S OPINION.
Sewall Must Retire or the Populists Will
Put Up Another Ticket.
ATLANTA, Ga., July 30.â Tom Watson,
the candidate of the Populists for Vice-
President, telegraphed to the Constitution
this morning as follows:
"In the event that Sewall does not
retire the Populists will put out a full
electoral ticket. There can be no fusion
unless Sewall withdraws. I give you thia
merely as myjopinion."
He sends a second telegram,.in which
he announces the executive committee
will determine all these questions, and
perhaps the State conventions will do it,
and declares that he stands by his letter
to the Augusta Chronicle, in which he
stated that unless Sewall retired there
would be two plans for action. One was
two distinct electoral tickets, and a second
electoral ticket, composed largely of Demo
crats and partly of Populists. He con
cludes his telegram to-day by the
statement: "My own judgment is tbat
we must run a full electoral ticket unless
Sewall retires."
THE NATIONAL PARTI.
riant Presented for an Artire and Tig-
orou* Campaign.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, July 30.â The Na
tional Executive Committee of the Na
tional party was in session here) to-day.
Plans were presented for an active and
vigorous campaign throughout the coun
try. Ex-Goyemor St. John will at once
begin a month's canvass of Ohio and Penn
sylvania. Mr. Bentley will speak up to
election. His first appointment will be in
Indiana. Mr. Thomas, Mr. Southtjate and
others will also begin campaign work im
mediately. Arrangements were made for
a wide distribution of literature.
The following resolution was adopted
without dissent:
Whereas, The statement Is being indus
triously circulated that the National party haa
been approached with propositions looking to
fusion upon platforms and candidates not un
compromisingly committed to the broad re
form principles lor which our party stands, it
i 8 hereby declared by the National Executive
Commitee that the National party will per
sistently and consistently pursue the purposes
for which it was organize'!, und holding itself
clear from all entangling aud compromising
alliances, will steadily support each and all of
the reforms for which its platform declares, its
candidates, Charles E. Bentloy for President
and James 11. Southgate for V ice-President.
SALFERITES ARE VERY SORE.
"Kick" Over the Indorsement of the Re
publican Candidate*.
DENVER, Colo., July 30.â Every daily
newspaper in the city condemns the con
duct of the majority of the Republican
State Committee for their action ol yester
day in indorsing McKinley and Hobart.
The fact has been shown that the D.-nver
men wno held proxies for remote counties
secured them* by misrepresentation and
their action will not be indorsed. Lauding
business men all deplore the effect tuis
action will produce, and they predict a
defeat of the Republican State ticket and
the return to power of the Populists.
When the country press and the mining
districts are heard from the protests will
be most pronounced. It is given out on
good authority that Senator Wolcott really
desires to secure the gubernatorial nomin
ation lor the purpose of vindicating him
self and to secure a proper recognition in
Colorado of the Republican National
ticket.
The chief canse for protest is because of
the misleading effect of this action in the
Eat t, the Silverites fearing that their cause
will thereby be jeopardized. The effort to
call the State committee together again at
an early date to repudiate the action of
yesterday will be stron ly pushed.
COLORADO SPRINGS, Cot... July 30.-
The general opinion of the majority of
Republicans in this city in regard to the
action of the State committee yesterday is
tbat the majority did right in declaring
for the National ticket. While they are
for union on a State Republican ticket,
they think the State organization should
be preserved in the hands of McKinley
Republicans. Democrat! now hope
strongly ior the election of a straight
Democratic ticket.

elected S. A. Wright of Springfield per
manent chairman; J. Welier Long of
Kansas City, vice-chairman ; M. V. Car
roll of Lamas, secretary, and Cyrus Pax
son of Kickock County, assistant secre
tary.
The convention decided to put a tull
State and electoral ticket in the field and
to clothe the State Central Committee
with extraordinary power by authorizing
it to form a fusion ticket if deemed neces
sary. On account of tue power invested
in the State Committee that committee
has been doubled.
Chairman Wright in his speech stated
that he believed that the Populiats could
elect Watson Vice-President, and that
they should have their man on the ticket
or lose the whole thing. The sentiment
or a large majority of the delegates is for
forcing such a fusion as will give them
the vote for Vice-President.
The platform favors the issuance of
greenbacks; opposes the issue of bonds;
declares that all mortgaged property
should be assesses to mortgagor and mort
gaged in equal proportions; demands tha
tenactment of laws to enable poor families
o seenre public lands and to prevent
aliens from owning lands in the United
States; also favors a law to put a stop to
pauper immigration. It declares in favor
of a constitutional amendment to revise
article V of the constitution.
The committee on resolutions has pre
pared an address, which will be read to
the convention to-morrow, to suggest
plans for fusion with the Democrats. The
committee adjourned at 10:20 o'clock to

earnestly nope that China's evident de

Under Commander Sigsbee, chief of the

repeated efforts have been made to

the matter has consequently lagged.
With the co-operation of all the Govern

â¢ "tary Herbert is seriously considering tne
/â¢'advisability of ordering a naval court
martial to try the officers of the United
States ship Charleston, which vessel re
cently arrived in San Francisco from
Honolulu. It is charged against Captain
:..' Coffin, his chief engineer and the pay-
master that, instead of coaling tbe Charles
ton from the Government coal pile at
Honolulu, the vessel's officers purchased
fuel from private contractors at $12 per
ton, the total cost being $6000. In justifi
cation of their conduct the Charleston*
officers say that they did not like tile Gov
ernment coal at Honolulu.
The Call correspondent learned at the
Navy Department to-day that a court
martial would probably soon be convened
at Mare Island.
Naval officers stationed in Washington
were much gratified to-day upon receipt of
news that Lieutenant J. C. Colwell, execu
tive officer of the Kutahdin, who was
court-martialed for assault, had been ac
quitted and restored to duty. Admiral
Bunce, who ordered tbe trial court, has
approved this verdict. Lieutenant Colwell
is well and favorably known at Mare
Island.
.Harry B. Jordan of Tacoma, Wash., has
been appointed cadet to West Point, and
Henry M. Boutelleof Olympia alternate.
The torpedo-boat Cushinp, which 'has
been lying at Washington navy-yard, for
seyeral months, left there this morning
for New York on her way to Newport,
where she will be stationed for the rest of
the summer for duty in connection with
torpedo practice.
She will make the entire journey by the
inland passage, and will stop at New York
for a few days to take on necessary stores.
The Cushing has already traversed this
route several times, and there 4s no longer
any doubt of its practicability for naval
vessels of light draught. The trip is made
by way of Chesapeake Bay, Delaware Bay

AGUIRRE TO BE PROTECTED.
Spaniards in Cuba Will Have- f Try
Him Fairly-
NEW YOKK, N. V.. July 30.â A special
to o the Herald from Washington says:
The Unitefl States has thrownÂ°its protect
ing arm around* George W.* Aguirre, the
American citizen under arrest in Havana,
Cuba. Acting under instructions cabled
by Actfng Secretary of State Rockhill Con
sul-General., Lee has demanded of tbe
Spanish authorities of Cuba that Asuirre
be released or that his case be turned over
to the civil courts fqr trial.
A*;uirre?s case in some respects resem
bles thoseof the Competitor prisoners, and
it may be that the Spanish authorities
will .pursue the policy of delay in the
Aguirre matter that they have forlowe4 in
the Competitor affair.
Aguirre was tried some days ago, ac
cordingto State Department information
from Cnba, by a marine court-martial.
But nis case being claimed by the military
service, he was remanded to it for trial by
a military tribunal.
Military officials say that the Spanish
authorities have an idea that Aguirre is a
spy, and intend to try him on this charge.
It is the department's intention to closely
follow his casse, however, and a strong pro
test will be filed and further action will
be taken hi case the "Havana authorities
should pass an unduly severe osentence0 sentence on
the prisoner.
GOLD EXP LORED TO BE CRECKED.
Xeui^ York Importers Hill llnndto Only
'â¢ a sterling Exchange. ' o <
â¢NEW YORK, NY., July 30.-In order
that the work assumed by the foreign ex- =
change syndicate of so controlling the
New York market for sterling exchanfee'
that there will be no exports of gold â¢for
the next three or four months may be
effective, measures o have been taken to se
cure the co-ojperation of the principal im
porters. It was learned yesterday that
several ,of the largest, importing houses
here had expressed their willingness to
work in harmony, with the syndicate's
plans in tbrf purchase of sterling ex
chanae.
, The New York importers bvfy an im
mense amount of â  foreign exchange in the
natural course of business, and should they
come to an understanding whereÂ°by most
of them will buy and handle sterling ex
change only within, the lines marked out
by the foreign exchange bankers' commit
tee, the snecess of that committee's task is
assured. It is understood that a large pro
portion of the importing firms have already
agreed to buy, only such exchange as their
business actually needs, and they will pay
for it such rates \ as may be agreed on as
being fair and reasonable under 0 the cir

CUTTING WESTERS RATES.
There Is a Prospect of n Lively Passen
per War at Chicago.
CHICAGO, 111., July 30.â There is still
a prospect of a lively passenger rate war
to the West. No agreement was reached
by the Western Passenger Association at
its meetings yesterday and to-day. In
speaking of the matter Chairman Cald
well said that everything would be all
right if the roads would only stick to the
$30 rate to Salt Lake, but that there was
every danger that a further cut would be
made.
"The original cut to the firÂ« chiefs'
meeting has not tended to soften the
Lard feelings already existing between the
.roads, but if we can keep the $30 rate to a
one-day limit I think everything will turn
out all rittbt," said. Caldwell. Should one
oi the roads make a further cut an utter
demoralization of rates is feared.
MISSING INSURANCE MAN.
Squandered Poor People' s Money and
Thru Ititappeared.
NEW YQRK, N. V., July 30.-A special
to the Recorder from Syracuse, N. V.,
says: Orrin N. Lumbert, president of the
Industrial Benefit Association of this city,
an assessment insurance company with a
large membership, has left town and his
whereabouts are unknown. Last week the
affairs of the association were placed in
the hands of a receiver, and about the
same, time Lumbert disappeared.
The receiver has been unable to locate
any cash assets of the concern, but it is
learned that sums of money aggregating
oetween $6000 and $10,000 have been drawu
from the banks where the association's
money, was deposited.
These. drafts were made upon checks
payable to Lumbert. The receiver of the
association is besieged by persons anxious
to know what, if anything, they are to
receive in return for money they have in
vesjed with the company. Many of these
people* are poor, aged and decrepit, and
the matter has assumed a very serious
aspect. Humbert spent money lavishly
and made considerable effort for social
recognition. The receiver cannot find the
books of the concern, which have dis
appeared also. It is believed that they
are in the hands of a New Jersey concern.
WAGES TO BE REDUCES.
Pennsylvania Ironworkers Will l.ote
One- Tenth Their Pay.
NORRISTOWN, Pa., July SO.â Notice
has been posted by R. Hecksher & Son, at
their blast-lurnace at Swedeland, that be
ginning August 1 reduction of wages will
go into' effect. Common labor will be re
duced 10 per cent and bosses and superin
tendents 20 per cent. About 2000 men
will be affected.
Notice of the reduction has created
great dissatisfaction among the man and
soÃie of them predict that unless the firm
agrees to pay every two weeks, instead of
monthly, as at present, ther*> will be a
strike. By way of equalizing matters, so
far as circumstances justify, tbe firm has
reduced the rent ,of its tenants $1 per
month. The reduction is attributed to a
depressed condition of the iron market,
due to overproduction and the free-silver
agitation.

The Unfortunate Victim's House
.\ Burned and Her Furniture
.". ' Demolished. * .'
BIIOOMINGTO^ Ind., JulySO.-Agrgss
outrage 0 was committed at Modesto, a
small town near here, a few nights ago,
the details of which leaked out to-day. A
strong effort was made by certain influen
tial people to keeD the matter quiet, but it
was Of such a fiendish and cruel character
that it could not be concealed. The
trouble occurred over certain rumors con
nected with the character of a Mrs. Nettie
Chrisman, who was living there.
Nothing definite against her was known,
except the fact that she had incurred tÂ£e
enmity of certain people.
Threats had been made of some action
to be taken in her case, but the woman
paid no attention to them and went ahead
attending to her business. A few nights
ago, whiie she was sleeping quietly at her
home, a loud knock at the aoor awakened
her. She looked out of the window and
saw a crowd of thirty men standing out
side in the moonlight. She recognized
them at once as whitecaps. Hastily bar
ring t&e door and oiling some furniture
against it she anxiously awaited develop
ments..
Alter the first knock the men patiently
waited .ten minutes and then several of
them hammered on the door quite
vigorously.
"If you don't open the door," shouted
one of them, "we will break it down."
Mrs. Chrisman kept perfectly quiet,
hoping the men would co away.
They bad no such intention, however.
In a very few minutes they battered the
door down and rushing into the house
seized the woman. She was only
partially dressed and she begged them
piteously not to harm her.
The brutes, however, paid no attention
to her entreaties, but dragged her out into
the open air. A rope was then produced
and after being fastened around her wrists
it waa passed over the limb of a tree and
tightened so that her whole body was
lilted clear of the ground.
The woman screamed with agony. The
cords cut into her wrists and blood trickled
down her arms. The men laughed at her
when she begged them to cut her down.
Not -content with that cruelty the wretches
determined on further brutality. Long
keen switches were produced, and several
men began, to beat the woman unmerci
fully. She finally became unconscious.
The crowd then took all of the furniture
out of the house and threw it into the road
way." Afterward they set fire to the house.
At last accounts the woman was in a
precarious condition. Great indignation
is" felt about the outrage.
RETTRATST AT A PARROT.
Officers Capture a Counterfeiter Who
Clung to His Pet.
JERSEY CITY, N. J., July 30.â The pre
liminary bearing in the case of William
Sands, alias Dr. Clark of Buffalo, who js
charged with extensive counterfeiting, is
in progress to-day before United States
Commissioner Romaine. bands is the
man whose devotion to a parrot resulted
in bis losing his liberty. He nas owned
tne bird â a magnificent creature with
green, red and yellow plumajre and re
markably endowed with the gift of gab,
not only in English, but in Spanish and
Frenchâ for -several years, and wherever
he went the parrot went with him. In
formation given by Sands' accomplices
put the detectives on his track, and by the
parrot he was traced through the Catskilla
and hall a dozen towns in the upper part
of the State and finally down tne New
York Central road and across the bay to
Jersey City, the entire search occupying
several , weeKs. The parrot is now in
charge of the United States officers who
made the arrest, but although it keeps on
repeating, "Too bad, too bad, master's in
troubleâ locked up," it does not know
enough to be used as a witness. Sands
has made a partial confession and is will
ing to "peach" on his associates.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JULY 31, 1896.
THE TREASURY
DEFICIT GROWING,
Extremely Bad Beginning
of the New Fiscal
Year.
THIS MONTH'S SHORTAGE
Thirteen Million Dollars Excess
of Expenditures Over
Receipts.
EXCUSES OF THE OFFICIALS.
Payment of the Sugar Bounties Will
Prevent Any Improvement
in August.
WASHINGTON, D. C, July 80.âTo
morrow is the last day of the first month
of this fiscal year. The deficit of the
treasury is to-day thirteen and a half
millions for the first month. It will be re
duced by methods so well known to treas
ury officials by about half a million to
morrow, so that the shortage for the first
month will be only thirteen millions.
It is statedat the treasury, in extenua
tion of this appalling. deficit, that the first
month of every fiscal year always shows
the heaviest expenditures of -the year.
There are the deficiency appropriations
coming over from the preceding fiscal year
to be met, and the expenses of all depart
ments are always of unusual amount.
Thus this month $13,000,000 was spent by
the Pension Bureau, $7,000,000 was paid
out in interest, more than $5,000,000 .was
required for the War Department, $4,000,
-000 for the Navy Department, and over
$12,000,000 in other departments not speci
fied in the above list.
The deficit for the month snould prop
erly be $18,000,000, inasmuch as Secretary
Carlisle promised the Louisiana and Call*
fornia sugar planters again and again that
the $5,000,000 for sugar bounty would be
paid out. this month. In view of the
â¢startling proportions which the deficit was
already acquiring early in the month, Mr.
Carlisle simply suspended the fulfillment
of such promises. He has given directions,
however, that the $5,000,000 shall be paid
next month, and first payments will be
made oo next Monday. With $5,000,000
suear bounty to be paid out of the treas
ury during tne month Â«i August, little
hope is entertained by the treasury officials
that the deficit for the second month of
the fiscal year will be much smaller than
that for the first.
The feeling among well-informed of
ficials as to the treasury's prospects for
this year is by no means sanguine. In
spite of all that is printed by free-trade
writers the customs receipts, under the
Wilson bill are not improving. On the
contrary, they are steadily falling off.
Internal revenue receipts, or at least that
portion derived from the whisky tax, snow
a growth. This is accounted for by the
fact that all the whisky which was hur
riedlytaken out of bond just before the
Wilson bill increasing the whisky tax
from 90 cents to $1 10 per gallon went into
effect has now been consumed.
It is not believed that the Presidential
campaign this year will have much effect
on importations. In the two preceding
Presidential elections, tariff being the
overwhelming issue, importers held back
all goods ordered until after tne ejections.
There is such a Btrong feeling, However,
among business men that there will be
no tariff legislation for years to come, no
matter now the election goes, chat there
will be no noticeable effect in the customs
receipts this summer and fall.
Treasury experts have, of coarse, no ex
pectation that the promise of a surplus of
$7,000,000 at the end of this year, made
by Secretary Carlisle? in his last annual
report, will be fulfilled. They expect the
usual deficit.

IDENTITY OF THE DEAD OUTLAW
The Man Killed by Sheriff Douglass of
Nevada County Had Many
Aliases.
.NEVADA CITY. Cal,, July SO.â lt
transpired to-day that a mistake had been
made in tbe name of the highwayman
killed near this city on Sunday afternoon
by Sheriff Douglass. The stranger worked
four days at Marsh's sawmill, six miles
from here, where he gave the name of W.
L. Davidson.Â° Soon after the body was
brouglit to town M. L. Marsh Identified it
as that of the men he, had hired and who
quit so soon Â«f terward. He said the dead
man's name was C. Meyers. An examina
tion of the books shows that he gave the
name of Davidson.' This difference in
name may be the means of learning his
real identity, although he doubtless had
many aliases. â¢
The information that the robber was the
stepson of Theodore Winters was sent
here from Marysville and was based upon
statements made to parties in. that place
by a man supposed to be thte fellow who
was killed by Sheriff Douglass.
Nothing new has developed in the
search for the other outlaw. The suspect
has succeeded in getting beyond the
reach of the officers. Some persons are
still of the opinion that the dead robber
and the Sheriff were the only participants
in tbe shooting. One theory upon which
this belief is founded is that Douglass
came upon the robber unawares and or
dered him to surrender, that the latter
reached for his rifle, when Douglass fired,
shooting him through the abdomen.
Seeing tUat the fellow was badly
wounded be ceased firing and approached
the prostrate man for the purpose of de
termining tbe extent of the wound and
placing him in a comfortable position,
and that he made a pillow of the robber's
coat and placed it beneath bis head.
Seeing tbat the coat made a very flimsy
bolster he took off his own coat or duster
and started to roll it up to add to the pil
low; that while folding the coat he laid
his pistol down, and the robber, having
still considerable vitality left, grabbed the
pistol and fired at Douglass, tbe bullet
striking him in the hand; that Douglas?,
finding himself unarmed and wounded,
turned to run, and was shot in the back,
receiving a mortal wound; that the rob
ber, realizing that he was himself fatally
wounded, placed the muzzle of the pistol
to his own breast and sent a bullet
through his heart.
The wound in the robber's side was
powder burned, indicating that it had been
received at close range. This theory wou!d
account for the four empty chambers in
Sheriff Douglass' pistol when it was found.
The Coroner's jury in the case of the
robber rendered a verdict last night, find
ing that deceased was about 35 years of
age, and that he came to his death from a
gun-shot wound inflicted by Sheriff Doug
lass.
To-day the inquest on the dead Sheriff
was continued. Numerous witnesses were
examined, but few new facts of any con
sequence were elicited. This afternoon
the jury were taken in a four-horse rig to
the scene of the killing, and to-night the
taking of testimony will be resumed.
D. F. Roddan of Wheatland, agent of
the Covenant Mutual Life Association of
Galesburg, 111., was in town to-day and
states that Sheriff Douglass had his life
insured for $5000 in his company. Mrs
Douglass is very sick and was taken to
San Francisco for medical treatment.
Saturday the Board of Supervisors will
appoint a successor to the late Sheriff.
The following have petitions in circula
tion : Norval Dougiass Sr., father of de
ceased ; J. H. Pascoe, present Under
Sheriff; D. McPbetres of Truckee. E.

Silver Advocates of All Parties Have

LOS ANGELES, Cal., . July 30.â A ma
jority of the *. Populist delegates to the
Congressional convention of that party,
which ,' will be held at San Luis Obispo,
August 11, held a secret conference in this
city this afternoon, the' result of which
will doubtless have an important bearing
on the Democratic Congressional conven
tion which meets at Ventura, August 4.
The' conclusion of the conference favors
an out-an-out Populist candidate, regard
less of the action of .the Democrats, so far
as avowed candidates for the nomination
are concerned. This means that neither
'George Patton, nor L.- J. Rose, one of
whom seems certain of nomination, as
matters now stand, can get the indorse
ment of the Populists.
The Populists argue that since they have
declared their willingness to support the
Democratic nominee for the Presidency,
the Congressional candidate should be
conceded to them, since, according to the
results of two years ago in this district,
they polled ..nearly as many votes as did
the Democrats. Tnis unexpected move
on the part of the Populists argues
strongly in favor of a very dark horse with
pronounced Populistic - tendencies win
ning at Ventura. _â

Chee, one of the n?ost noted Chinamen on

'Chee, you are feeling much better?' He
nodded bis head in the affirmative. His
pulse and temperature were good and his
wouuds were healing nicely."
At 11 o'clock a post mortem was held
when it was revealed that death was due
to a clot of blood found in the blood ves
sels of the brain caused by the bullet
wonnd.

RAILROAD ASSESSMENTS,
Interesting Proceedings Before
the Stats Board of
Equalization.
Elaborate Compilation of Statistics
Which Greatly Impressed
That Body.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., July 30.â The
Board of Equalization spent the morn
ing listening to the extended argument
of Thomas Mellersh, the secretary and
controller of the San Francisco and North
Pacific Coast Railroad, why the assess
ments on the railroad property gener
ally, and his road in particular, should
be reduced. Mellersh presented statis
tics purporting to show that the railroads
throughout the United States were as
sessed out of all proportion to other prop
erty. He showed that in 1892 fifty-two
roads went into the hands of receivers,
and iii the first half year of 1895 twenty
five roads were foreclosed. The average
rate per ton of freight moved was reduced
from 1.236 cents in 1894 to .851 cents in
1895, but the assessments had not been
lowered in conformity.
Â£The question of using the income of the
road as a criterion for valuation came up
at this point. Governor Budd advanced
the idea that the market value of the stock
would fix the value of the road.
Chairman Morehouse assed if the stock
could not be manipulated and run up or
down as the occasion suggested.
Speaking for his road, Mr. Mellersh
stated that it was assessed at the rate of
$11,400 per mile. Mellersh stated that the
operating expenses were greater than ordi
narily over a large portion of the road.
To the casual onlooker the proceedings
were dry and uninteresting, yet to the
members of the board they were replete
with interest and gave a better insight
into the workings and requirements of the
great railway systems of the world than
could be acquired in years of study, and
from the compilation of volumes of
statistics to-day the board fully realized
that they were addressed by men who had
given years of study to the question and.
were probably the best informed in this
line of any on the coast.
Another tning which materially aided
to insure them a hearty welcome was the
fact that they made no plea for any reduc
tion of their tax levy, and yet their argu
ments, in which they clearly demonstrated
that railroad property was assessed tqually
as well if not better than individual prop
erty, had great weight with the board and
the correctness of the schedules presented
were without cavil. Mr. Mellersh's chief
object was to impress upon the mind of
the board that railroads should be assessed
in accordance with their gross earnings.
Governor Budd spoke in favor of raising
rather than lowering values, claiming that
if values were doubled the tax rate would
be cut by one-half. He claimed that the
high tax rate obtained in California kept
capital from investing.
In his closing argument Mr. Mellersh
said: "If the State must have money to
pay outstanding and prospective debts the
board must assess property at such a rate
as will enable it to raise the money. It
is observable that private property is as
sessed moderately. The Btate needs more,
and instead of the needed being taken out
of property generally it is tacked on to the
railroads."
Six thousand eight hundred wheels
(bicycles) are on the assessment list in
San Francisco, and he estimated that
$5,000,000 bad gone out of the State in the
last eighteen months for "bikes." People
in Sonoma County, he said, are selling
their pianos and sewing-machines and
buying "bikes." All these are reasons
why railroading is uot as profitable as for
merly.

SAN BERNARDINO BUSSTER.
Horsewhipped a Mother and Her Chil
dren in a ll rut n I Manner.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal.. July 30.â
This morning a French woman : named
Jura, residing in this city, was terribly
whipped with a buggy whip by a man
whose name she does not know. She ap
peared at Justice Soule'a court with the
blood streaming from a wound in her
forehead and from one qn her arm. It
seems that her two boys, aged 5 and 7,
were herding the woman's cow on the
highway .when a man ordered â  them to
keep the animal off the road. The boys
neglected or refused , to obey the order and
the man proceeded to use the whip on
the youths. The mother came to toe boys'
rescue, when the man turned his attention
and blows to her. A little daughter of the
woman : also : received % the lash. A John
Doe warrant was sworn out and a con
stable is looking for the brute. A neigh
boring boy says be knows the man who
did the whipping, and it is ; believed that
he will soon be in custody.

"Ask Too Much.

consists of seven lots on the southeast cor
ner of 3 Q and Ventura streets, improved
by two cottages and . barns. Defendants
want 15600 for Jjie property, while the rail
road company considers $3000 as a high
figure^ but is willing to pay- it. An at
tempt was made to compromise the suit
last night, but it failed. . A large number
of witnesses haye 0 been subpenaed and the
case will probably not be concluded till
Saturday evening.

wind up all matters at issue between

site here. Everything else has been set
tled by arbitration or condemnation,
chiefly the "former.. Graders in the vicinity
of Belmunt, north of tbe city, are making

THE SAIST FRANCISCO CALL., FRIDAY, JULY 31, 1896.
GOODRICH DAM
WAS DYNAMITED,
Startling Discovery Since
the Recent Flood
Disaster.
PIECES OF FUSE FOUND.
Strong Evidence That the Das
tardly Deed Was Prompted
by Malice,
DETECTIVES HARD AT WORK,
Father, Mother and Five Children
Were Swept to Death by
the Torrent.
BAKER CITY, Ob.. July SO.â Sufficient
evidence ha 9 been discovered to snow that
the recent Goodrich Creek disaster, which
swept seven persons into eternity, was
caused by the blowing up of the dam with
dynamite by malicious persons seeking re*
venge. Suspicion points to two or three
persons and arrests may be made in a few
days. Several detectives from Portland's
private agencies are working up the case.
The Goodrich Creek disaster occurred
about two weeks ago. Early one morning
the dam of the reservoir, which covered
thirty acres, gave way. The waters left
the creek, swept over the country, struck
the house of the French family and car
ried it several miles. The bodies of the
father, mother and five children were
found in different places along the water
course.
The owner of the reservoir, S. B. Baisley,
has always refused to believe that the dam
gave way, and has repeatedly declared
that it was blown up by his enemies to
prevent use of the water by him in placer
mining. He was determined to discover
and punish the miscreants, and with that
object he employed several detectives, who
have been quietly at work in Baker County
for over a week.
Yesterday morning the detectives went
over the scene, and near the broken dam
they discovered pieces" of the fuses of two
or three dynamite cartridges. The fuses
were covered by brush and drift dirt.
Several persons, whose enmity to Mr.
Baisley has been of long standing, are
under surveillance. When sufficient evi
dence to warrant their arrest is obtained
they will be taken into custody.

place was tilthie6t of all, and that the
health of the .customers of the dairy has
been seriously endangered. The cows are
kept in a small pen and get no exercise.
Their water supply is very bad and the
animals become feverish.' rendering their

TACOMANS GOING
ON A WHALE HUNT
A King of the Deep Seen
Between Tacoma and
Olympia.
PLANS FOR HIS CAPTURE
Tug Expedition Formed With
Harpoons, Cannon, Ropes
and Buoys.
GREAT SPORT ANTICIPATED.
Steamers Are Being Chartered to
Carry People Out to Witness
the Chase.
TACOMA, Wash., July 30.â Three en
terprising whalers, who formerly sailed
from San Francisco, have organized a big
expedition to capture a good-sized whale
which has been sighted among the islands
between Tacoma and Olympia by steam
ers several times during the last two
weeks. The whalers are Edwin Clark,
Richard Pitt and Martin Phillips. Several
other seamen are interested with them.
Olof Ralston has been sent to Ander-
Bons Island to watch the whale's move
ment. If he remains in that locality ac
tive warfare will be commenced Saturday.
The hunters have wired to San Francisco
for six harpoons, which will arrive to
morrow. They have expended nearly
|300 for equipment, which includes ropes,
buoys, tackle of all sorts and a cannon,
brought from Portland, which is being
cleaned for use.
The tug Laurel was engaged to-day, and
it is the intention to shoot harpoons into
the monster from the stern of the tug. If
the attempt is not successful the hunters
will put out in small boats to harpoon
him. They count on securing forty-five
to sixty barrels of oil, worth at least $20
per barrel.
Pitt thinks the- whale seen belongs to
the gray California or bull-fin variety,
which is a prolific oil-yielder, bat whose
bone is worthless. He believes a number
of whales are sporting about in the upper
sound, as one rarely travels alone. In
that event the sport will last longer than
one day. Pitt said to-day :
"Tr.o harpoon will trail an airtight
barrel float. I believe an injured whale
will travel sixty miles an hour, and there
is little doubt that he will run ashore
while sweeping along the sinuous routes
of Puget Sound. There he will be help
less, aa the openings from the bay where
he now lies are so few that he is not likely
to get away."
Several steamers are being chartered to
carry people out to witness tbe chase.
Hundreds of others wiil view the sport
with field glasses from the beaches and
islands.

leaders of t the State will hold important

'State campaign shall be opened and out
line the work to be done. ' :
-. This afternoon the executive committee
â¢â¢will hold a meeting at Golden Gate Hall,
and to-morrow afternoon the State Central
Committee will meet at the sanie place.
. . "There is little to be said in advance of
the meetings," said Chairman Fraivk Mc-
Laughlin last night. "The work of ,tUe
literary committee in the preparation Â£>l
campaign literature, the selection pi
â¢ speakers, the raising of campaign funds
and some, such business matters will be
taken/up. â¢ I expect a large attendance and
that there -will result a general infusion, of
, till more Republican enthusiasm."
â¢ Jacob H. Neff of California was one of
a number ot committee members from the
interior who arrived yesterday.
H. Z. Os borne came up from Los Angeles
a day in advance of the other members
who will attend and he informally took
hold of the affairs of the executive com
mittee of which he is an important mem
ber. Osborne reported that the South
ern California auxiliary executive com
mittee, which is to be composed of the
members of Che executive committee from
south of Tehachaip, would soon be organ
ized and at work.
"The committee has not been formally
organized," said Mr. Osborne, "but it will
betc-morrpw, and we ill organize and get
' to work right away after the meeting of
the committee here. We have already
_ opened headquarters in the Westminster
.' in Los Angeles adjoining the headquarters
of the Sixth District Congressional Com
mittee and the Los Angeles County Com
mittee. The southern Democrats "organ
ized such an siuxilary committee two
years ago, and .1 think that ours will be
â quite an advantage to the Republican
cause. '
"It too early yet to talk very defin
itely about tie political situation in South
ern California, but our prospects are very
bright. It is noticeable that a great many
Republicans who got out and declared
themselves for free silver at the beginning
of the craze are now for McKinley. The
longer the Republicans talk the silver
question the fewer talk for iree silver, and
the more there are who realize what else
th^re is in this campaign beside,*." :
From all over the State come reports of
the multiplication ,of Republican clubs
; and -the early exhibition of campaign in
terest. Â° o
The indications are that Congressman
Eugene F. Loud 'will receive near unani
mously the Republican nomination for
Congress in the Fifth District at the con

SWANSERG ARRESTED.
He Will Be Brought From Chicago for
Trial.
A dispatch was received by Chief Crow
ley yeaterday morning from Chicago that
Charles O. Swanberg Had been arrested.
The necessary papers for his extradition
were immediately prepared, and Detective
Ross Whitaker wiil leave with them this
morning for Sacramento to get the Gov
ernor's signature to the warrant. He will
nt once proceed to Chicago to bring Swan
berg back.
Crittenden Thornton, the attorney for
the Corriveau estate, has deposited $500
with Chief Crowley to cover the expenses
of bringing Swanberg back from Chicago.
Captain Lees said last night that he had
received word from Chicago that Swan
berg wa's not so willing to return as H. W.
Westpnal would lead any one to suppose,
! and thAfche would likely apply for a writ
|, of habeas corpus. -The captain wired to
J tlie Chicago- Police Department that
I.Wbttaker. would leave at once with the
requisition' papers.
"I am inclined; to believe," said the
captain, "tdat there is something more
serious in the case than the mere change
of perjury, although when it iÂ« looked
into that is serious enough. When Swan
berg testified that he did not know Corri
veau, prior to August, 1893, it was done
for a purpose and will be iound very ma
terial.
"One fact is very plain, and that is some
j one has got away with the estate of Louis
Corriveau. Of the $75,000 in coin known
I to be in the possession of the old man
shortly before his death not a dol
lar has been found. The estate funds have
absolutely disappeared, and it is charged
that Swanberg knows something about the
disappearance.
"Thft allegation is made to us that Swan
i berg and Westphal got the money out of
the old man during his last "illness.
Whether that be true or not the case de
mands the fullest investigation."

salito News. Other towns, they con
tended, had got up successful carnivals,
and why not Sausalito. Her highlands
and her beautiful waters would be the
piace for an illuminated display. Colored
signal fires on the peaks would flash far
over the bay ana countless lights from the
houses and from the shipping would com
plete the wonderful scene.
Consequently a mass-meeting was or-
I dered. at which thÂ« oreliniinary steps
j would be taken toward carrying out tiie
j idea of an ideal Sausalito night carnival.
At 8:30 last evening a brass band took
its station at the door of the Town Hall
; and presently martial strains were floating
over the hill, the front and the bay. All
bau^alito gathered Uu.-re and the hall was
filled to the doors. The principal citizens
of the place and a number of ladies
occupied seats near the chairman's stand
If any one doubted the spirit that actu
ated that crowd, the number and enthu
tnatm apparent there surely cleared away
these doubts. Sausalito generally divides
herself In four partsâ the hill, the front
the north and ti:e southâ and on ordinary
matters she draws the lines between tho4
quarters, but last evening she was a com
mittee of the whole and working for the
"night."
The meeting was called to order by J H
Pryor. who proceeded without any delay
to call for the choice of a temporary chair
man. General Dickinson was unanimously
nominated.
The General took the stand and stated
that a "night in Sausalito" would be one
not eclipsed by a nijtht elsewhere. The
town is so situated that a carnival or any-
thing of tnat nature could not but be a
success.
"I am heartily in accord," said he,
"with the movement as planned by its
originators, Messrs. Bruce and Pryor. I
understand tuat the project has already
been encouraged by financial backing.
With this difficulty overcome we can now
KO ahead and puU together and make 'A
Night in Sausalito' one of the grandest oc
casions known in the festivities of the
State."
Upon the suggestion of General Dickin
son, Mr. Pryor was chosen temporary
secretary and afterward made the perma
nent secretary.
C. C- Bruce was elected temporary chair
man of tne meeting, and took his seat
amid great enthusiasm.
Upon the motion of General Dickinson
an executive committee, of eleven, from
] which a financial committee will be taken,
j was appointed.
It was moved as an amendment that the
committee be increased to twelve that
three could be chosen from the four divi
sions of Jthe place â the hill, the water
front, the new and the old town. This
was strongly opposed as there should be
no divisions in the work, but all should
labor in unity.
Attorney T. J. Crowley, upon being in
vited to speak, stated that although he
was a resident of San Rafael he was in
touch with the idea, as were many other
people of the county seat.
Other persons present spoke earnestly
in favor of the proposition, pledging their
hearty support, and all in the hall ex
pressed themselves heartily in support of
the project.
Chairman Bruce stated that he would,
within the next few days, appoint the dif
ferent committees and that all present
might know that the "night" was already
assured, he suggested that Saturday
evening, September 19, would be a fitting
time for the carnival, and it was unani
mously agreed to set that evening for tne
fete.
In fact so enthusiastic was everybody
j that none dissented to any proposal, and
| little time was lost in the real business of
the mass-meeting.
Upon motion the chairman adjourned
the meeting with the announcement that
the committees which he would appoint
would assemble at the hall next Tuesday
evening.
YOUTH'S DIRECTORY FAIR.
The Work Already Done Indi
cates a Successful Fes
tival.
Chcuncey Ocott Will Give a Ben fit
Performance for the
Directory.
The work of getting up a fair and festival
for the benefit of the Youth's Directory is
proceeding successfully. There is a cer
tainty that one theatrical benefit perform
ance will be given soon to aid the direc
tory, and there is a prospect of another.
The festival will be held in Armory Hall
for nine or ten days, beginning September
28 next.
A meeting was held last evening at
which there was some pleasant discussion
as to whether the ladles should be per
mitted to solicit patrons on the floor of
the fair for the sale of exhibits, and the
feeling of the meeting was that the ladies
could be left to use their own discretion
as to how far to go in this feature of the
work.
When tickets were offered to be taken
for sale for a blooded-horse and buggy and
a era nd upright piano, at $600, a
pretty girl floated forward, said she would
take fifty and see if she had that many
gentlemen friends. The blooded-horse
and buggy tickets were all gone in a few
minutes, but the piano tickets for the time
being remained.
The principal feature of the meeting was
the introduction of Chauncpy Oicott, who
is starring in the Irish play, "Mavonr
neen," acting Manager Eugene fcchutz
and M. J. Murphy of the company. They
offered to give a benefit perlormnnce for
the directory. The offer was accepted. A
committee was appointed to arrange a
date, and a resolution of thanks to Mr.
Oicott and bis partner, Mr. Pitou, was
unanimously passed.
It being understood that Manager
Alorosco of Morosco's might lend an ear
to a proposition for a benefit performance,
a committee wai appointed to see ninij
and the meeting adjourned for two
weeKs.
AN AGENT TO JAPAN.
Joint Meeting ot Commercial Bodies at
the Chamber of Commerce.
At a joint meeting yesterday of the
members of the Chamber ot Commerce,
the Board of Trade and the Manufacturers'
and Producers' Association John L. How
ard was in the chair. The object of the
meeting was to discuss the matter of send
ing a commercial commissioner to Japan.
It was decided to appoint a committee
of seven to take into consideration the se
lection of an agent, who will then inter
view the merchants of this City with the
purpose of enlisting their aid in this
effort to secure the Japanese trade for San
Francisco.
The chair was given time to appoint the
committee.
Bound for San Rafael.

ranged as a feature of the day.
CHARITABLE WORK
DONE BY GERMANS,
Quarterly Meeting of the
German Benevolent
Society.
MANY FAMILIES AIDED.
Excellent Condition of the Fi
nances of the Scciety
at Present
MEMBERSHIP MUCH INCREASED
A Grand Promenade Concert to Be
Given Some Time During the
Coming Fall.
The quarterly meeting of the German
General Benevolent Society was held last
night at Druids Hall on Sutter street,
above Stockton. The meeting was well
attended and considerable interest was
manifested in the proceedings.
The report of President Brcemmel for
the quarter ending June 30 showed that
the society was in a very satisfactory con
dition both in the number of members and
the finances. The receipts for tne quarter
amounted to $29,451 77 and the expendi
tures $22,273 37, leaving a balance of
$7178 40. The cash on hand on June 30
amounted to $11,340 88, as against $9787 39
at the end of the preceding quarter.
A vast amount of charitable work has
been carried on by the society during the
past three months. Relief has been given
to 273 men and 134 women, in addition to
190 families that have been aided. In 604
cases of charity $2375 35 has been ex
pended. In the drug-store managed by
the society 2107 prescriptions have been
furnished) and seven patients without
means treated at the hospital.
An encouraging increase in the mem
bership of the society has taken place
since the beginning of the quarter just
closed. One hundred and forty-eight
members Have been added to the roll, as
against 109 for the preceding quarter. The
total membership on June 30 was 3207, as
against 3097 at the end of March.
Several minor changes were made in
the constitution upon the suggestion
of the special committee appoint
ed at the last quarterly meeting for
the purpose. The changes related princi
pally to the admittance of new members
and admission fees. A motion was carried
to establish a permanent fund from the
payment of life-membership fees, to be
used only in cases of necessity for building
or some similar purpose.
It was also resolved to hold a festival or
promenade concert about the end of Octo
ber or the beginning of November in con
nection with the German Ladies' Benevo
lent Society. While the society hopes to
benefit financially by such a festival the
main object is to unite and interest the
members of the society and the Germans
of this City; __
CLARKE MUST NEED MONEY.
The Counselor Sues the Police Com-
missioners for S'J, OOO.OOO.
Attorney Alfred Clarke, better known
as "Nobby" Clarke, yesterday filed a suit
against the individual members of the
Board of Police Commissioners of 1894,
which, should it be decided in his favor,
would bankrupt every one of the defend
ants.
The suit is filed on behalf of Fred Frey,
to whom twenty-six policemen who were
discharged from the force on April 15,
1894, have assigned their claims against
the City. There are also twenty-four more
claims held in reserve. Forty thousand
dollars damage* is asked in each case, a
total of $2,000 000.
The grounds on which the suit is brought
are that the policemen were "dismissed
without any cause whatsoever, owing to tee
evil eyes, depraved minds and abandoned
hearts" oi the Commissioners. It is
claimed that the dismissals were made at

NOT A BRUTAL SPORT.
Admirers of Babbit-Conning Defend
Their Favorite Pastime.
Lovers of rabbit-coursing are resolved to
show the enemies of cruelty to animals
that their favorite pastime is neither
brutal nor unmanly. Wednesday a number
of well-known society men interested in
the sport got together for the purpose of
talsing over the feasibility of forming a
club.
As yet no definite steps have been taken,
but it is understood that a meeting for the
purpose of perfecting an organization will
be called at an early date.
"For my own part, I simply deny that
the sport is brutal," said William H.
Chenowith, one of the local connoisseurs
in the matter of fox terriers and rabbits
and their mutual antipathies. "I snow that
some members of the Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Animals, notably its
secretary, have characterized these pas
times as the very acme of barbaric ferocity.
We hope, however, in a very short time,
to show them that their ideas are warped
and mistaken.
"To begin with, the hares or rabbits will
be given every chance to escape. The dogs
used will not be cruel hounds, which rend
and mangle any animal they may catch,
but light, agile fox terriers. These does
kill their prey at the very instant of nab
bing it, and each brings his catch forth
with to his master's feet.
"I have a little beauty whose name is
'Fiver.' She once belonged to the Earl
of Essex, but while still a pup was pre
sented by him to Nat Goodwin. Once
Goodwin was playing cards and went
broKe. Seiziug the pup he placed her on
the table saying, 'Here goes for a fiver.'
He won heavily, and thus my bonnie girl
got her name. . She has two cups as bright
as herself. The idea of anybody saying
that such animals coi'ld be cruel!"
An exhibition of rabbit-coursing is in
prospect, which the officers of the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
will be invited to witness. If they see
Â«nything objectionable in the sport it will
be discontinued, otherwise the club will
be permanently organized and hold its
matches at frequent intervals.
Building Trades Council.
At a meeting of the Building Trades Council
last evening resolutions were passed denounc
ing the Board of Education tor letting the
work of renovating the schoolhouses to con
tractors who employ non-union workmen and
pay low wages. It was decided to continue
the matter of admitting delegates from the
International Bricklayers' Union until the dif
ferences with the local union are settled.
Vice-President H. F. Collins was elected presi
dent vice H. Myers resigned, and H. C. Hincken
was chosen to fill the vr.oancy.
NEW HOTEL PROJECT.
Only a Small Crowd nt the Mats- Meet-
ing far 11* JJineuiÃiou.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., July 30.â There
was a decidedly small crowd in the Los
Angeles Theater to-night to attend the
mass-meeting called in the interests of the
new hotel project. About $1000 was
pled?ed by those present, although the
subscription was not officialy started at
the meeting. Colonel H. G. Otis suggested
that a committee of three be appointed to
segregate the various businesses atid pro
fessions into classes and a thorough can
vass be made to raise the additional funds
necessary for purchasing the hotel site.
Colonel Otis, E. F. C. Klokke and E. A.
Miller were appointed as the committee in
addition to members of the committee.
Remarks were matte by Mr. Junna Neal,
who is at the head of the enterprise, J. S.
Slauson and Jefferson Chandler.
Eureka Itamatje Suit.
EUREKA, Cal., July 30.â Lillie M.
Martin na9 commenced suit in the Su
perior Court against the City Street Im
provement Company of San Francisco for
$50,000 damages. She is guardian ad litem
of the three minor children of Edward
lnma'n, one of three larborers who were
killed at the Government jetty works on
July 17, when a car overturned into the
ocean and buried the men under tons of
rock. The complaint alleges that the fa
tality was due to a defective car, owned by
the company, which has a contract to
build the north jetty.

We niujit organize victory if we are
going to have victory at all.
Every Republican is needed in the pro- |
cession, and all should be there.
Democracy is as incapable of giving us
Â° BOilnd money as sound business. â â  |
> Â«o Tom Reed has led the way in Maine,
and tfce whole East will soon be roused.
'Â» Every Republican of energy and influ
-1 ence is counted on to help in the canvass, i
â¢
The Solid Seven no longer sneer when i
they ask: AVliat are you going to do ;
about it?
Protection to industry means wages to !
labor, and that is the money question in I
California.
â¢
Free silver with no work and no wages
would bring no comfort to the homes of
the people.
o Democratic talk threatens a panic, and
if that party should win the talk will not
be in vain.
Bryan cannot carry Nebraska; Bewail'
Â° cannot carry Maine; Watson cannot carry ,
, Georgia, and there you have iv
The gold Democrats of Nebraska "will
not trust Mr. Bryan. They have had their
eyes on him a long time and know nirn
well. Â°
The tax-shirkers may have a mass-meet
ing to indorse the Solid Seven, but it will
. be in a back-room, and the people will be
â  excluded.
The Teller bolt was not big enough to
Bhut the door fast on Colorado, and she is
coming out strongly for McKinley and
protection.
With fifteen months in jail before him,
Jameson has a chance cto repent at leis
ure; but there is dunger tbe villain may
write a book.
It is worth noting that even the wildest
bolters- from the Republican party are
not bolting so far but what they can k eep
one loot on the protection plank.
As one result of the Chicago platform
gold boarding has begun, and thus has the
Democratic party once more inflicted an
injury upon the trade of the country.
A man must be a silly rather than an
intelligent advocate of free coinage of sil
ver who is willing to intrust it to the class
of men who control the Democratic party.
If the gold Democrats carry out the pro
posal to nominate J. Sterling Morton for
President the climax will t>e capped, and
Nebraska will immediately become a
storm center.
The absence of any sign or sound of a
free-trader in this campaign is one of the
cheering proofs that even a Bourbon
Democrat can learn a little sense if you let
him have bis fool way for a while.
Taking the taxes off rich corporations
and piling them on the homes of the
people, tts tbe Solid Seven haveUone, may
be a means of enriching somebody, but it
certainly won't enrich the community.
Republicans should make this cam
paign everywhere with the protection ban
ner fuil advanced to the front. It was
under that standard the people prospered,
and they will carry it 10 victory this year
all along the line.
There is no chance of Democratic suc
cess in this contest except the one chance
of overconfidence in the Uepubiican ranks,
and it seems by their factions and their
wranglings the Democrats Jre-tryine to
increase that chance by every means in
their power.
"For my part," said Tom Reed, in open
ing tbe canvass in Maine, "I want a pros
perity which by good wages to ail is
â bared by ail. We want broader life,
broadening erery day for all our people."
This is tbe true Republican aspiration and
the people share iv
The important question which includes
all other questions of tbe campaign is
that which Tom Reed asked of the people
of Maine on Wednesday: "It this Nation
has thrice at the poils condemned tbe
Democratic party when it was better, are
we now to place it in power when it has
become worse? If the Democrats blun
dered in business with their best men
present, are they going to be a success
with their best men absent?''
THE WAGE-BARNER'S FIGHT.
The wage-earners of tbe country are
more interested in the issue of this year's
campaign than in any former struggle for
political supremacy. To be Â»ure all classes
are vitally interested, but it so happens
that . the Democratic party's declaration
is a direct attack upon working people.
The inventors of that party's platform
did not seem to appreciate the strength
ana influence of the laboring men of the
country when they made what is the
equivalent of a declaration of war upon
them. The impetuous appeals of orators
to labor to join in the revolutionary
movement are better calculated to make
labor suspicious than submissive. In fact,
so antagonistic to the best interests of )a
bor are the purposes of the Democratic
and Populist core bine that the campaign
might be called the wage-earner's battle
for borne and opportunity to earn wages.
It is a mistake to suppose that capital,
that rich people would suffer most were
the economic vagaries of the Bryans
adopted for the rule and guide of the Na
tion's affairs. The rich can always adjust
their holdings to new conditions. In fact
they can retire altogether from the activ
ities of the business world, but not so with
wage-earners. When their hands are idle
ttieir income ceases, and if they have put
by a little money for use when the rainy
day comes it has to be drawn upon for cur
rent expenses. But that is not all the mis
fortune that would come to the wage
earner were the principles of the Bryans
practically ap'piied in the public concerns
of the country. He would have to deal
with an unsound and treacherous mone
tary system which would deprive his
wages of purchase power, stability and
certainty.
The wage-earners of tbe "United States
arc ihe principal supporters of building
associations. â  They have nrore than $500,
-000,000 invested in them, and every dollar
of it is worth 100 cents anywhere in the
world. Wagd-earners together with other
classes have over $13,000,000,000 placed in
life insurance companies, to ray nothing
oi tbe millions that are invested in fra
ternal life insurance associations. A great
deal of this money will be due and pay
able in the not very distant future, and it
is a matter of the greatest importance
that it retain its present purchase power,
for in proportion as it is paid in unsound
njoney will the insured be a loser.
The latest statistics show that there are
1017 savings banks and institutions in this
country with depositors aggre-.
gating nearly 5,000.000, with total de-'
posits reaching the enormous sum of, in
round numbers, $1,900,000,000. Ot course
these banks and institutions kecD the
money loaned for the most part on real
estate mortgage security, and it is payable
in money worth 100 cents to the dollar,
but how many cents to the dollar would
these savings of wage-earners be worth if
Bryan's wild, uncertain and fluctuating
hat dollars were to become the circulating
money medium of the country? These
are matters which wage-earners cannot
think about too seriously. Bryan says if
his plan should fail it would be an easy
matter to try another, and keep on try
ing, but are wage-earners ready to have
their wages made subject to experiment
at the hands qf theorists? Every dollar in
this country is as good as its face value in
gold, and it is Mr. McKinler's purpose to
maintain that parity. It is his purpose,
too, to make gold and silver interchange
able on their own merit, but by agreement
arid not by the hat of martial law.
REED'S POINTED QUESTION.
Speaker Reed has opened the campaign
for the party in Maine and bounded a new
keynote for the party in every State. Re
â¢ferring to the plight tbe Democrats had
thrust the country into he said: "If they
blundered in business with their best men
present, are they going to be a success on
finance with their best men absent?"
Here is a question that every voter in the
counfry should feel was put to him per
sonally. If such men as Cleveland, Hill,
Yilas, Vest, Yoorbees and Palmer proved
themselves unequal to the task of giving
tbe country a business administration,
what is to be expected from such men as
Bryan, Altgeld, Debs and Sovereign? To
answer that question correctly is to vote
correctly, or for McKinley, which is the
same thing.
Mr. Reed is quite right in holding Dem
ocratic incompetency as well as foolish
legislation responsible for the terrible
financial panic of the last three years.
Times were good and business active
until Democratic tinkering with tbe cus
toms revenue created the suspicion in
business circles that there was likely to be
a great deal of blundering, and after that
it did not take long for confidence to
withdraw from commercial circles. It
could not be otherwise than that a disas
trous panic should follow such conditions.
The administration forfeited tbe confi
dence of the public iv its ability to man
age the affairs cf the country on business
principles, and naturally enougn capital
and industry were driven into hiding.
Now, if the greatest men of tee party
failed to see what the needs of commerce
were, what would be the consequence of
Democrats of the smallest caliber getting
possession of the government? Cleve
land aud his advisers forget more every
day about tbe science of government than
Bryan would know in a lifetime, and yet
nothing but commercial and industrial
wreck and ruin is sure in their path. "If
this nation has thrice at the polls con
demned this party when it was better, are
we eoing now to place it in power when it
has got worse? If they blundered in
business with their best men present, are
they going to be a success on finance with
their best men absent?"
FREE TRADE AND BUIN.
Tbe student of practical politics will
find much to interest him in The Call's
third article on the wool industry in to
day's issue. The salient point brought out
by the historical sketch of wool under the
Bryan-Wilson policy is that William Jen
nings Bryan is hardly a kindergarten
graduate in the science of economics.
In his defense of the Wilson bill tbe
"Boy Orator of the Platte" predicted that
free trade would enable American manu
facturers of woolen goods to build up an
export trade that would call for more
workmen at higher wages. Let us see
what the cold facts say.
Iv every department of the wool in
dustry, from the sheen-grower to tbe girl
who attends the weaving-machine, there
is general paralysis. Sixty per cent of the
American mills are idle, and American
wools are to-day 33 per cent under tbe
London market, with a slow sale. Under
the McKinley bill they were 44 per cent
above the London market, and sales were
active.
The loss to American woojen-mill em
ployes and others engaged iv the wool
industries of the country amounts to a
third of a million dollars each day. At
Lawrence, Mass.. 30,000 employes are idle
and hungry. How do these facts comport
with William Jennings Bryan's prediction
that more people would be employed than
under protection and at increased wages?
The reports show tlm the Wilson-Bryan
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JULY 31. 1896.
policy has greatly helped the English
woolen industry; that English mills are
busy making $20,000,000 of cheap shoddies
every year for the American market, as
against $1,250,000 a year under the Mc-
Kinley biil. Under the benign effects cf
that law all the factories were busy, work
men were happy and a million llockinas
ters were prosperous. They dispensed
$24,000,000 annually in wages, but they
have now become mere producers of
mutton.
More startling still is the showing that
the entire saving for all this destruction is
but 88 cents on each snit of clothes of the
finest quality and less on t tie working
men's clothing. Â«
We commend the reading of the story of
the ruin wrought by free trade to all im
partial students of the signs of tbe times.
It is apparent that without protection
American industries must perish ana
American laborers go hungry.
"ORGANIZE" 18 THE ORDER,
A general meeting of the managers of
tbe Republican party has been held and
Dlans agreed upon. That this will be the
roost vigorous campaign tbe party has
ever waged there does not appear to be
any doubt It is understood that it is the
wish of Mr. McKinley that the best possi
ble educational work be done, for the
questions at issue mean so much that no
one should be left to do any guesswork.
The honor and prosperity of the nation
are attacked, and Mr. McKinley is anxious
that the people should know exactly what
the election of the Democratic-Populist
combine's candidate would mean to them,
and what tbe return of the Republican
party to power would mean.
Mr. McKinley is no doubt directing in a
general way hi 3 campaign. At all events
it looks tbat way. Mr. McKinley believes
the tariff and financial questions should
not be divorced, but at tbe same time the
fact should be paraded that the financial
depression of the country is due almost
wholly to Democratic tinkering with the
tariff. He believes that no substantial
prosperity can be counted upon until a
tariff is adopted that will insure enough
revenue to meet the expenses of the Gov
ernment. Let the fallacy of Democratic
monetary theories be shown up on every
occasion, but tbe tariff question should
not be minimized. Tbe tariff question
should be made the rallying point, but in
doing that the importance of giving the
country a sound and safe circulating money
medium t-hould not be overlooked.
But what was urged most at the general
meeting of the narty's lenders was the im
portance of local organizations. TLcre
should be a well-organized club in every
school district, even if there are not more
than a half-dozen voters. It is from the
neighborhood organization that the coun
ty. Congressional and State committees
get the ''forecast." It is to be hoped tnat
the Republicans of California will see the
importance of conforming to the wishes of
Mr. McKinley, and organize so perfectly
that every Republican voter in the State
will be an active member of some sort of a
campaign club.
TAX-PAYEES AND TAX-SHIRKERS
Tbe action taken by the Grand Jury to
bring about the prosecution of seven mem
bers of tbe Board of Supervisors, and the
mass-meeting held to denounce the con
ouct of those official*, have been beneficial
to the public inasmuch as they have
served to call attention to the great wrong
done to the taxpayers of tbe City by tbe
seven Supervisors in showing undue lavors
to tax-shirking corporations.
It is not the province of a newspaper to
prejudge cases that are to be tried in the
courts, and Ihe Call will not attempt to
do so in ibia case. Whether tbe indict
ment will stand or whether sufficient evi
dence legally admissible to convict is ob
tainable are questions we do not care to
enter upon. These are matters for the
courts. There is, however, a broader issue
than that which wil 1 be carried into court,
and one on wh ich there will be accepted
all evidence that carries a moral convic
tion to fair-minded mer. That issue it is
the proviuce of newspapers to present
over and over again and to press insist
ently upon the people. It is the issue of
the gross wrong done to honest tax-payers
when officials, whether from corruption or
from favor, allow dishonest tax-shirkers
to escape their share of the common tax
necessary to maintain the municipality.
That the favored tax-shirkers in this
case are rich and powerful corporations
well able to bear their due share of the
public burdens is an aggravation of the
offense, inasmuch as this favoritism to
those who are well able to pay compels a
heavier tax upon those who are less able
to do" so. That the reduction in assess
ments for taxation of those corporations
was made by officials who had themselves
fixed the valuations of the same property
at millions of dollars more when estab
lishing the rates of charges to be made
upon the public was also an aggravation,
inasmuch as it showed a shameless disre
gard for even a pretense at fair dealing.
These two aggravations ot a wrong origin
ally serious enough to fairly justify the
term robbery have raised it to a point
where tbe absence of public indignation
would imply the absence of a public con
science. To protest against such offenses
is the duty of every citizen and of every
journal that cares anything for the public
welfare or its own good repute.
All protests and resolutions should tend
to some action. The case of the accused
Supervisors can be left to the courts. The
issue of securing better officials in their
places must be carried to the polls. If we
are as a people to profit by the lesson
taught by this exhibition of oflicial favor
itism to tax-shirkers we mast begin to do
so at once. A municipal election is ap
proaching. Good citizens and honest tax
payers must unite to make sure of the
election of honest men. That is the broad
issue before us. Let us unite, work to
gether and win.
The men who have had to pay more
than their share of taxes because the
Solid Seven favored the big tax-shirkers
have a just right to kick, and if they do
not land the kick with vigor the shirkers
will cinch them again.

PROTECTION.
New York Press.
Those people who are beseeching Republi
cans to abandon the issue- of protection in the
present campaign in order to attract the bal
lots of free-trade Democrats who favor a gold
basis currency may spare their breath. The
Republican party neither casts aside its prin
ciples in the fear of losing voters nor subscribes
to false doctrines for the purpose of gain
ing votes. The Republican party in its plat
form adopted at the St. Louis convention de
clared for protection for the same reason that
it declared for sound money. In eachxaso the
declaration was one of principle and not for
the voters of any class nor the support of any
body of men does the Republican party repu
diate its principles.
The Republicans of this country will insist
upon their voters deciding the result of the
coining election oo the question of free trade,
Mri h a repudiation of the debts that free trade
brings to every man, or of protection with
work and trnde for everybody, and the pay
ment o( wages, debts aud all obligations in
an honest money that has a full value every
where. These are the living principles of the
Republican party. We stiould have declared
them if there bad been no Democratic party,
no Free Silver party, no Populist party, no
other party under the sun. aud to these prin
ciples we shall adhere as long as good faith
and honor prevail among men. If the Repub
lican party abandoned the principle of protec
tion it would cease to have a reason lor exist
ence. It demanded the restoration of pro
tective duties on the day that tne Wilson law
went into effect. Since the election of Grover
Clevelaud in 1892 the country has indorsed
this Republican demand at every State and
Congress district election.
The people have seen the debt of the Nation
increased by half a billion of dollars under a
free-trade adininistraiion. They have seen
our credit impaired until we are compelled to
send abroad millions of gold monthly to pty
for our purcnases of goods in foreign lands.
They have seen the home market shrink to
insignificance because the waxes that should
have gone to Americans, trade that should
have gone to Americans aud barter that should
have gone to Americans went to foreigners;
because all classes have earned less money
than in year* before.
It was protection that paid off the National
debt without iDterauÂ£iou until a free-trade
administration came to swell it enormously
for the first time since the war. It wrb protec
tion that crowded our mills with workmen,
rilled the shops with customers and supplied
countless buyers for farm products.
It was protection that gave us such an
abundance of evervttiing that we could send
thousands of shiploads of our bounties for sale
all over the world. Then there was no need to
maintain the treasury reserve with forced sup
port. Then we did not drain ourselves of the
standard currency of the world to pay our
obligations abroad, for, instead of sending our
money to foreigners, foreigners seat their
money to us.
Talk, then, of abandoning; protection when
ail this has been changed by free trade, when
lour more years of a policy of bankruptcy and
ruin would mnÂ«n inUerv and shame tenfold
â rreater ilmn thoÂ«e ot the tree trade era! We
say, rather â etnee Dcmocratn who profess to be
our allies appeal to uÂ» to ignore the tariff ques
tionâwe say, rather, null the colors of protec
tion as high on the mavt as we can place them!
Nail them there, and then, as lone as they
float, fight for the magnificent, the invincible
principle of protection 1
BRYAN'S KISS OF BETRAYAL.
New York bun.
We called attention yesterday to the appa
rent origin of Mr. Bryan's favorite figure of
speechâ that of the crown of thorns. The boy
orator was present in the House of Representa
tives ou January 26, 1894. when his Republi
can associate, Mr. .McCail of Massachusetts,
closed a speecn on protection with an eloquent
peroration containing this passage:
Do you regÃrd your bill with reference to laborT
Ready as you have ever been to betray It with a
kits, you ncourge it to tbe very quick, and press a
crown of thorns upon its brow.
This seems to have made a great impression
upon Mr. Bryan's mind. He appropriated the
crown ot thorns and has been pressing It upou
the brow of labor ever since. He waited, how
ever, for eleven months, or until December
12, 1894, before he used Mr. McCail's crown of
tborni in the House of Representatives.
Not so, however, with the kiss of betrayal.
Four days after Mr. McCall's speech of January
2*>, 1894, Mr. Bryan undertook to reply to the
Hun. Bourke Cockran on the subject of the in
come tax, aud he worked in the kiss of be
trayal thus:
Oh, sirs; is It not enough to betray the cause of
the pourâ must it be done with a kiss? [ Applause J.
We should say that when the applause
sounded, Mr. McCall was the proper person to
stand up and make the bow.
SCANLAN, THE ACTOR.
It Is Proposed to Pboionq His life bt Rs-
MOVI.NG HIS HBAIK.
Westminster Gazette.
We give the following story, without com
ment, just as it reaches us through Dalziel's
New York correspondent: "A remarkable ex
periment is now beintr made for the purpose of
bringing relief to William Scanlan, a famous
American comedian, who is now in an insane
asylum. A number of doctors who examined
Scanlan decided mat his brain was dead and
gradually decaying, with the result that death
would probably take place shortly, his case
being in this respect unlike the usual course
of paresis and idiocy. Professor Curtis of the
New York College of Physicians has been
making a number of experiments upon the
brains of dogs.
In one case in which he removed the brain of
a dog the animal lived a month; another
which was similarly experimented upon lived
three months, while another is still living,
notwithstanding that its brain was removed
fifteen months ago. It appears to be well so
far as its ordinary bodily health is concerned,
but it is quite devoid oi intelligence. It has
lost the senses of smell and hearing, but it ap
pears to retain that of taste. It is, too, per
fectly able to retain its balance, and when
lying down can recover its feet if it withes to
arise, its temper remains and it resents teas
ing. If the experiments are successful a trial
will, it is proposed, eventually be mcd* to re
move Scanlan's brain, in the belief that he
will thus be assured years of liKe, although
without intellect oi any kind."
A QUESTION OF RAISINS.
When the Wilson bill took $20 a ton off the
duty on raisins whom did In benefit?â Kern
County Echo.
Not the domestic grower, certainly; and if
the consumer got any benefit from it he got
the foreign goods below the cott of production
in this country, which is cheaper than any
American citizen has a moral right to get any
thing. That $20 a ton simply represents a
loss of badly needed revenue and a little
more advantage to the foreigner in retaining
his hold on the market. â Fresno Republican.

The Political Partiesâ P. P., Santa Crux,
Cal. The theories of the different political
parties are best expressed in the platform of
each. These have been published In full in
the columns of The Call, and if yon will r~ad
them you will be able to talk politics uulrr

Bones in the Bodyâ N. N., City. The num
ber of bones in the human body varies at
different periods of life. Many of them are in
two or more pieces in the child; ret, they after
ward grow together, forming but one bone in
the adult. The number of bones usually given
is 209, besides the 32 teeth. Of these SO are
in the head, 54 in tbe trunk, 64 iv the upper
limbs and 00 in the lower limbs.
Black Cockadeâ G. S., City. The black cock
ade was a badge worn by the American soldiers
during the Revolution, and later by the Fed
eralists during the hostility toward France
occasioned by the X. Y. Z. dispatches in 1797.
Its meaning was the fact that it had been part
of the Continental uniform, and it served as a
contrast to 'he tri-colored cockade of France,
which the Republicans had affected. "Black
Cockade Federalist*" was a term of reproach
applied to the members of the Federal party
in the days of its decline.
Bryan's Ageâ Dom, City. William Jennings
Bryan, the Democratic candidate for the office
of President, was bornjin Salem, Marion County,
111., March 19, 1860. A man is always M
years of age until be has attained his thirty
jeventh year, that is in the ordinary sense of
declaring that he is so many years old. A man
wishing to give his age at the time he desires
to be registered, for the purpoi-e of enabling
him to vote, if he were born on the Bth of Jan
uary, 1860. would declare his age to be 36
years.
Straits of Magellanâ G. C. L., Golden Gate,
Cal. The Straits of Magellan are three miles
long and vary in width lrom three-quarters of
a mile to fifteen miles. On account of the fogs,
precipitous snores, numerous hidden roefcs and
sudden squalls it has come to be avoided by
sailing vessels, which find the circuit of Cat>e
Horn far less perilous. Careful observations
made by the masters of steamers of many na
tions, in passage, have been recorded to an ex
tent that makes it at present comparatively
safe lor steamers. There are no tow boats in
the straits. ________________

A DAINTY FROCK.
Dresses of fancy wool mixtures for young
girls are very effectively trimmed by plain
cloth of one color. That shown above is of a
material in which numberless colors are mixed
haphazard in weaving, the trimming being of
sage green lady's cloth.
A mixture of bluet and dark green had a
dark green cloth trimming, edged with bluet
spangles.
A plain blue serge was made into a stylish
gown by the use of fancy Bilk for the trim
ming. - â¢
A dark green rough cloth had a top of printed
velveteen on which greens and pale blues
blended very harmoniously. :
A dainty little frock for dressy wear when
days are cooler was of a mixed goods in a me*,
dium light shade of blue, with the top of vel
vet of the same shade. From the top of th*
velvet collar stood a ruff of blue ribbon to

of heavy weir so it stood out and did not
hang over the collar. â  -' :-.-.,; ;\ .;.-â  :

CAPTAIN CARET HAPEY
Says He Has Discovered a New
Course and Will Follow

A HEAVY STORM ENCOUNTERED
It Confined Parser Bendall to His
Room for Nearly Twelve
Hoars.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's
Monawai redeemed Herself yesterday.
Since she has been on the run between
Sydney, N. 8. W., and San Francisco the
Ihc Meamer Monowai Was Caught in a. Gale Between Sydney and Auckland, and Purser Bendell
Was Confined to HLs Room for Twenty-four Hpurs on Account of the Waves That
Broke Aboard. Nevertheless She Made the Run on Schedule Time, and Captain
Carey and Chief Engineer McKaig Are Jubilant.
general result has been â twenty-four hours
late. On this occasiop, however, the
standard time, so religiously maintained
by the Alameda and Mariposa, was nearly
equaled, and Captain Carey and Chief En
gineer McKaig assert thatthey could have
broken the record had it not been for a
heavy northwest gale which the vessel
encountered between Sydney and Auck
land. â ' $
The ludicrous portion of that trip was
the fact that Purser Bendail was confined
to his room for twelve hours and nad not
a morsel to eat. owing to the fact that the
heavy weather kept the port hurricane- I
deck constantly under water. "Kendall
still weighs 220 pounds, however.
Among the many Australian skippers
who come to San Francisco Captain M.
Carey easily ranks as one of the most j
popular. He was born in Killarney, but
in 1835 he was sailinz out of New Bedford
in a whaler. He did not like the life, and
when the vessel put in at the Bay of j
Islands for water he managed to miss her j
when she acain put to sea. He then tried i
farm in<r, but could not make a success of !
it, and in 1859 he was third officer of one of |
the Intercolonial Royal Mail Company's !
steamers. A year latrr he hoi>ted the j
Union Steamssip Company's ring on the
steamer Wellington, and has stayed with i
that concern uutil it is now the biggest
arid most powerful corporation in the
southern seas.
Tint is one of the last trips the Monowai
will make to San Franci.-co. Chief En
gineer McKaig can g*>t more out of her en
gines than any man living, Dut, owing to
her poor model, no speed, except under
the most favorable circumstances, can be
got out of her. The company expects to j
put a new vessel on the line about the end J
of the year and if she cannot average I
seventeen knots an hour on a twenty-one
days' run she will not be accepted. She
will be 4500 tons burden and will, there

fore, be one of the largest vessels coming
to this Dort.
"The Union Steamship Company is
branching out," said Chief Engineer Mc-
Kaig yesterday. "It has bought a cargo
boat and has a new one on the stocks. A
twenty-knot boat is being built to run be
tween Onehemga and Wellington, to carry
our mails, and another fast boat is being
constructed to run between Auckland and
Sydney. Then there is the eighteen-knot
boat for the San Francisco trade, so, you
see, the concern is holding its own. The
Monowai is a splendid ship, but, unfor
tunately (with a sigh), we can't make time
with her."
Chief McKaig has been in the employ of
the company for a great many years.
When in latitude 11 51 south, longitude
170 50 west, the Monowai spoke the British
ship Monalta. The latter left here for Mel
bourne on June 7 with a load of lumber,
doors, iron, steel, nails, whale oil and gen
eral merchandise. She signaled her num
ber and then hoisted the flags C. Q. V. 8.
On reference to the register these letters
read: "Ship (or vessel indicated) is very
cranky." The Morialta was loaded here by
J. J. Moore <fe Co., and was considered safe
and sound when she left port. The chief
officer of the Monowai thinks there was a
mistake made in the signalling and that
the first flag should have been a red instead
of a white one.
Frank Burton, "the hustler", who is
makinc his way round the world on what
be can earn, is having a hard time of it in
Sydney. The newspaper boys here got
him a passage to Australia, but there was
no stlad hand for him in the colonies. He
attempted to get away to China on the
steamer Tai Yuan, but was put ashore and
had to await anot her chance. .Unless for
tune favors him he has no chance of get
ting back to Chicago on schedule time.

WORDEN HAS
ACTIVE FRIENDS,
Another Determined Effort
to Be Made to Save
His Life.
WILL ASK A REHEARING
Harry Knox the Moving Spirit
in the Cause of the Doomed
Man.
SERIOUS CHARGES IMPLIED.
The Convicted Man's Defense Said to
Have Been Virtually
Neglected.
8. D. Worden's life is not to be a forfeit
to the law without one more determined
effort on the part of his friends to save him
from the gallows. Already a movement is
on foot to secure hi-m a rehearing before the
Supreme Court with the ultimate object of
obtaining a new trial.
No one has taken a closer interest in the
whole matter than Harry Knox, who was
the president of the Sacramento Lodge of
the American Railway Union during the
big strike of 1894, and of which lodge Wor
den was a member at the time of the
wrecking of the train on which Engineer
Clark lost his life. He says be now feels
it a duty to Worden and to the order of
which he is still a member, to eventually
prove the innocence of Worden.
When seen at his home at 223 Ninth
avenue yesterday he spoke most feelingly
of the situation of the condemned man.
"While Worden was being tried at
Woodland," he said, "1 knew he was not
ably defended. He had a very poor attor
ney, one who, he told me, Carroll Cook,
one of bis prosecutors, had picked out for
him, after General Hart had withdrawn
from his case.
"To my personal knowledge the South
ern Pacific detectives furnished him
whisky all the time during the prelimin
ary examination and while he was in jail,
and thus virtually made a mad man of
him, for he was insane much of that
time.
"I believe that if the proper steps are
taken be can get a rehearing, and I am
sure he will be acquitted on a new trial, as
he was convicted more on the way he acted
during the trial at Woodland than on the
evidence against him. His abusive treat
ment of the Judge and hia whole peculiar
actious were due to the whisky supplied
hiic by the Southern Pacific detectives.
"I know'that young Sherburne's testi
mony was false, so far as he says that they
didn't net back to Sacramento tiil3o'c!ock,
as Worden was in the mediation commit
tee's room asleep on the bed about 1 :20 or
1:30 that afternoon, and I know it wouLl
be impossible for them to drive the dis-
tance and get back to Sacramento, as
yonnpr Sberbnrne says they did.
"I have been to see Attorney Monteith
in reference to trying to get a rehearing
before the Supreme Court, and it is my be
lief that if the facts are presented as they
should be the Supreme Court will grant a
rehearing. I feel confident that if we can
get a new trial Worden will be acquitted
simply by being properly defended, as the
others who were tried for the same offense
were acquitted on the same evidence that
resulted in the conviction of Worden.
Hatch and Appleman were acquitted be
cause they were defended in an able man
ner and \Vorden was not. In that cases of
these two men the fact? concerning their
alibis were brought out and everything
done that was possible to do to make a
fair defense. In Worden's case it was the
opposite.
"I had a good deal of valuable evidence
that 1 conveyed to his attorney, but the
latter refused "to use it.
"No effort will be spared to save Wor
den's life," concluded Kuox, with a deter
mined shake of the head.
Attorney George W. Monteith confirmed
the statements and charges made by Kuox
in a most emphatic manner.
"In regard to the decision of the Su
preme Court," he began, "I cannot give
an intelligent opinion upon i*. until I have
read the whole decision, but from what I
can gather from the newspapers the case
turns more upon the failure ot the defense
to take exception to certain evidence,
which, of course, amounts to nothing.
"I had occasion a few weeks ago to ex
amine the records in the case hastily on
the bnefs, and ii seemed to me as though
the case was not half presented. The Su
preme Court pimply acts upon what is pre
sented to it, and if counrel fai'a to prop
erly present the case they should not
blame the Supreme Court if they do not
succeed.
"From what I have seen I am satisfied
thai ll a prtfper application la made the
Supreme Court will grant a rehearinc. I
would have aup^arcd as amicus cunae and
presented a proposition that seemed to me
suflic.ent to secure a reversal, but when I
looked at the record it was too late to do
anything, as the case had been submitted.
"I have been requested to appear foa a
rehearing in the case and have tnat matter
now under consideration at the present
time. If tnere is any way to secure it it
will be secured.
"Aside from the case as it stands in the
Supreme Court, I am perfectly satisfied
personally tbat Worden is an* innocent
man. Ido not believe that he had any
thing to do with the wreckiag of that
train. We went all over the evidence in
the strikers' case, and I nave heard the
statements of witnesses under oath. In
deed, we developed some facts in that case,
in truth, a great many, that were not
brought out at all in the Worden trial.
"I have no hesitation in saying that I
do not believe that he received the fifth
part of a defense. The prosecution was
represented by a halt dozen able attorneys,
supplemented by a horde of Southern Pa
cific detectives and actively assisted by a
lot of Southern Pacific perjurers.
"In the Worden case one of the impor
tant facts was omitted from the evidence.
It would undoubtedly have made a vast
difference in the case. In the strikers'
case I elicited from the boy Sherburne the
startling admission that after the trip he
claimed to have made with Warden from
Sacramento to Woodland and return he
took another trip over exactly the same
ground with two Southern Pacific detect
ives. According to his story, told in
Woodland, they started at about 10 o'clock
in the forenoon with five or six men in
the wagon, drove to the trestle, did
the work and then drove almost to Wood
land a.nd back to Sacramento, arriving in
Sacramento about 3 o'clock. He then
stated on cross-examinaflon that he Took
that same tired team that had traveled
forty-four miles, and in company with
two Southern Pacific detectives that same
afternoon retraced the same trip. The
proposition was manifestly absurd, but
was important because it located the time
and circumstances under which the boy's
story could have been arranged.
'"Then, in the next place, the case
against Worden depended upon the rail
road's ability to prove that dynamite was
used to wreck the bridge. In the strikers'
case this theory was utterly destroyed.
The bent of the trest'e that was wrecked
simply showed cracks in the timbers run
ning their full length, caused undoubtedly
by the fa'l of the train upon them and tne
presence of the iron pins which acted as
wedges.
"Had dynamite been used the timbers
would not have been cracked but shat
tered.
"The alibi of Worden was proved by
three or lour credible witnesses. Besides
all this we have the written confession of
the man who did the work, substantiated
and corroborated.
"Had all these matters been shown in
the defense of Worden as they were shown
in the strikers' case he would have been
promptly acquitted. But it must be borne
in mind that these facts were not before
the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court
passes simply upon questions of law that
were the subject of aprjeal.
"I repeat that I firmly believe the man
to be innocent, and tbat he is deserving of
a strong effort in his behalf to save his lite.
We are trying to arrange now to see if
something cannot be done to help him."
RESCINDED THEIR ACTION
Supervisors Make Amends to
the Members of the Finance
Committee.
Municipal Appropriations Will Not
Be Consideied Except in the
Regular Way.
The majority in the Board of super
visors took the back track yesterday on
the question of fixing the municipal ap
propriation for the coming fiscal year and
made amends for the insult offered the
Finance Committee on Monday last.
At the request of a number of the mem
bers the Mayor called a special meeting
and eight representatives of the various
wards showed up when Mr. Sutro rapped
for order. The absentees were Messrs.
King, Uimond, Taylor and Hobbs.
When the meeting had been called
together Supervisor Hughes, who was not
present when Supervisor Wagner's insult
to the Finance Committee was indorsed
by a majority of the members, arose and
explained the reason for the meeting. He
stated that the previous action of the
board had evidently been taken under a
misapprehension, and that it was a
palpable insult to the Finance Committee
that should be apologized for and reme
died at the earliest opportunity.
He said that in former years resolutions
bad been passed calling meetings of the
committee of the whole to meet with the
Finance Committee to fix the appropri
ations, but that no effort had been made
to usurp the functions of the Finance Com
mittee, tne idea being to allow the vnrious
Supervisors to train an idea of the appro
priations so that they could act intelli
gently when ibe Finance Committee,
wuich had worked up. all of the necessary
fipures, reported.
In the present case the reading of the
resolution had been altogether mislead
ing and probably not what its author
really intended. He moved that the reso
lution be rescinded. When the matter
was put to a vote there were no dissenting
voices, and the matter stands as though
the committee of the whole had never been
called.

District Is Under
Fire.
EQUALIZERS DISAGREE.
The State Board Objects to the
Reduction of Thirty Per
- Cent
SIEEE STANDS TO HIS GUNS.
Changes In Valuations Declared to Be
Legal, and Broderick Has Not
Y-t Decided.
There is a prospect that the property
owners in the district south of the park
will be disappointed regarding the 30 per
cent horizontal reduction made in the
valuation of their holdings by the County
Board of Equalization.
While tLe ooard was in session about
150 protests were received, stating that
the Assessor had placed the valuations
altogether too high and asking the board
to reduce them.
Deputy Assessor Herzer appeared before
the board and stated that the Assessor had
discovered that he had made a mistake in
the valuation and that he would be per
fectly willing, in fact requested a reduc
tion of 30 per cent.
The property involved carries a valua
tion of nearly $500,000, so that the reduc
tion cuts quite a figure in the City's
revenue.
Auditor Broderick received the follow
ing communication regarding the reduc
tion from the State Board of Equalization
yesterday:
Han. William Broderick, Auditor, San Fran
cisco, Cal.â DeabÂ° Sir: The State Board of
Equalization respectiully calls your attention
to a recent action of the Board of Supervisors,
acting as a Board of Equalization tor the City
and county of 6an Francisco, in whica they
made a horizontal reduction of value of prop
erty In a certain district, and which they con
sider an illegal act 01 saia board uuder sections
3674 and 3075 of the Political Code.
The Supreme Court of this State nas decided,
aud we quote 01 Caliiomia, page 54, and 44
California, page 016, that the Auditor is to
disregard any illegal action of the county
board, and if you feel satisfied as to the ille
gality of sucn action it is the opinion of this
board that it is your duty 10 disregard said
changes on the assessment books. You might
consult with your City and County Attorney
in regard to the matter. Respectfully yours,
CHARLES M. COGLAN,
Clerk State Board of Equalization.
Owing to the strain of the work of the
Election Commission Mr. Broderick has
not yet been able to look into the matter
but will give it his attention at an early
date.
The Assessor's office will fight any
change in south of the park assessments.
Deputy Herzer said yesterday that the
reduction asked by Mr. Siebe'had only
been requested after careful investigation
and that the Assessor had acted clearly
within his legal right in askiug the re
duction.
Tue fact ihat 150 property-owners had
asked for an equalization made the con
sideration of the matter legal and gave
the board the right to equalize the entire
district.

HE WOULD BE A SAILOR.
The Son of A. M. Palmer of New York
ait A. B. on the Ship A. G.
Ropes.
The theatrical profession on tlie Ameri
can ship A. G. Ropes among the crew is
lenresented by K. M. Palmer Jr. of New
Yurie. He is the 20-year-old son of
the well-known theatrical manager. =Dar
ing the run from New York he did all the
work of an ordinary sailor. He is cer
tainly no shirker and can holystone decks,
reel a sail, splice a brace, grease a yard,
]>aint the gingerbread- work iCnd put a
"â hrtrk's fin on tbe flying jibboom with the
best man in the ship. He is rated as
"purser," but the only money he disburses
H what Captain Rivers advances him.
He is bronzed, but not weather-btaten,
and runs around the decks like a school
boy. His hands *how all the signs of hard
work, ami when he returns to New York
it will be six months before he will be
able to wear a decent-sized glove again.
"I am m a measure an old sailor," said
he yesterday. "I used to be a kind of
secretary to my father and made fourteen
voyages to Europe with him. My health
began to fail, bo I was shipped on this vov
ase around the Horn, and Captain Rivers
was told to make me "rough it, 1 ' Wiiile I
have been splendidly treated the 'old man'
nas not fnilad in carrying out his instruc
tions." Here the young sailor showed the
calluses on the palms of his hands.
"My father is going to open the Great
Northern Theater in Chicago next Septem
ber. He has secured tbe lease of it for
five years and will open with 'Trilby.' I
will return home in the A. G. Ropes and
then I will quit the life of a sailor."
THE COMING FAIR.
All the Space in tha Big Mechanics'
Pavilion Already Taken by
Exhibitors.
According to the reports received of the
preliminary work of the Mechanics' Insti
tute and Manufacturers' and Producers'
coming fair, it will be the greatest indus
trial exposition ever held on this coast.
All of the space on the lower floor has
been taken by exhibitors, and only by
close crowding and careful calculation
can any more space in the galleries be
disposed of. Those who will exhibit are
taking an active interest in the undertak
ing and a great rivalry exists as to who
will put in the most attractive displays.
As it will be a home-product fair in the
strict sense of the term, the management
has refused dozens of good bids for space
from agents and dealers who wished to
put Eastern goods before the public.
A local soap company is constructing a
large Grecian temple of its product that
will be twenty-three feet square. It will
be lighted by hundreds of small electric
lights. A firm of glass dealers will con
struct a temple of mirrors. .
The exhibit to be made by the Union
Iron Works will occupy 1500" square feet
of space. It will ba a miniature model of
the entire establishment at the Potrero,
including a part of the bay," drydocks,
etc. In the water will float models of all
the warships and on ihe ways will be the
latest production, the battfe-ship Oregon.
"What is known as the annex of the Pa
vilion will be converted into an electric
hall, and the entrance will be through a
huge grotto of rock salt. Opposite the en
trance for a stretch of fiilty feet will be
a display of every kino of electric
lamp known, all ablaze. Beside these
there will be exhibits of nearly every in
dustry in the State; the mining, agricul
tural, wool, wooden, leather, iron and
dairy interests will all be represented,
iv the latter display will be one by the
Dairymen's Association, a monster cheese
weighing five hundred pounds.
The exposition will open on September
I, but many of the exhibitors are begin
ning to brin? in their exhibits now. The
intention is to have everything in work
ing order on the opening day. The man

ORPHANS SING SWEETLY
i Little Girls Give Â» Concert at the Girls'
Directory Asylum Yesterday
Afternoon.
A"little concert" was fiven Wednesday
afternoon by the children o* the St. Fran
cis Girls' Directory Orphan Asylum, in
presence of an assemblage of admirers of
the institution. Among those present
were several Catholic ladies of prominence
who are distinguished by their charity and
their interest in Catholic charitable insti
tutions like tbe admirable orphan asylum
o of Bt. Fraucie, on Eueua Vista and Central
avenues.
The concert was given by the orphans
for the benefit of the c asylum, which has
been in need of financial assistance to
meet its necessarily heavy current ex
penses. Nearly 200 children are aÂ°t present
in the institmion, and thex *re supported,
cared for and educated by the sisters with
out the help of Jay people.
The average number of children in St.
Francis' Asylum is nearly 200. After some
time in the institution they are provided
with comfortable and proper homes. But
of late Sister Mines, the superioress of -St.
Francis, has felt the imperative demand
for ready money to continue the good
work in whichÂ°she is engaged, so the chil
dren totik it upon themselves to assist her.
The opening number was a song of wel
come by a chorus of little girls, and it was
followed by a recitation^ "St. Francis'
I Home." The remainder of the orogramme
! consisted of songs and recitations by the
I children, interspersed with vioiin and
I piano solos by Miss Marie Short and Miss
| W. Nevin.

CLAIMS AGAINST THE CITY.
! A Request That Old Debts Be Paid Out
of tbe Surplus.
The members' of the Merchants' Asso
ciation are taking up the cause of those un
fortunate creditors of the City who, sev
eral months a^o, furnished large quanti
ties of supplies to tbe various municipal
departments and who have not yet been
paid for tbeir" goods. The merchants
have started the movement by the
following letter to the Board of Supervi
sors:
Gentlemen: At the last regular meeting of
the board of directors of the Merchants' Asso
ciation it was unanimously resolved to -peti
tion your honorable board to use the surplus
nowÂ°remaining in the City treasury from the
pest fiscal year, if it can lpgaliy be done, to
liquidate the outstanding claims oi thoee cred
itors who have in good faith furnished aad de
livered goods and supplies to the munici
pality. .
This is not only a question of fair dealing
with tbe creditors of the City, but involves the
financial honor of San Francisco. Very re
spectfully yours,
Merchants' Association.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JULY 31, 1896.
ONLY A DOG THAT
WAS DESPERATE,
Suffering, He Deliberately
Turns to Relief in
Suicide.
HE SEES DEATH COMING.
Staggers From a Gutter's Agony
to Oblivion Under a
Streetcar.
RESCUED BY HUMAN FRIENDS,
He Was Carefully Dragged Back to
the Gutter Unconscious, Where
He Died.
A dog lay suffering on Montgomery
street Wednesday afternoon. Finally.with
a last, great rally of his lapsing energy, he
rose up and made a deliberate and deter
mined effort to commit suicide.
This dog was nobody's darling. He had
not been reared on cream and caramels.
His appearance plainly showed that his
place was not on Nob Hill.
However, he appeared to be a respect
able member of canine society. His hair
had been smooth and glossy before it be*
came ruliiea in the tilth of tbe street, lie
had on a common leather collar, but it
was new." But if there was anything in
which this dog was not mongrel it was in
the fortitude with which he faced death
and the heroism with which he calmly
saw it cruahine down upon him.
He lay in front of 619 Montgomery
street, near Clay. Part of the time his
bead was pillowed on the curbstone, and
his shivering, quivering body in the wet
gutter. At 4 o'clock it' was apparent that
be was dying in slow and increasing
agony.
This miserable animal of that race which
has proven the most true iriend of man
kind, raised bis eyes plaintively to the
stream of humanity that flowed by near
and whined. When he became too weak
to whine, still his eyes opened and looked
into' the multitude for one friend who
might bring him relief. Tne people passed
by with heedless glances. The dogs that
came that way paused and sniffed, and a
few Hcked him to show their sympathy
and affection, as dogs do. But they did
not tarry lone. They either had troubles
enough of their own or gave him up as a
.hopeless case and trotted on.
By 5 o'clock quite a crowd of curious or
idle or sympathetic spectators had
gathered around the prostrate body of the
moaning braje. A big policeman came by
and cleared the sidewalk, but he did not
offer to end the animal's misery. Poor
Towser feebly raised his head. He saw
the way clear. He also saw a Mont
gomery-street bobtail horsecar coming
from tbe south. He opened bis eyes
wider, as though by an increased mental
effort. He staggered to bis feet. He
reeled out into the street.
Poor Towser had made a desperate reso
lution to put himself out of his misery.
He could not kill hlmbelf with a revolver
because he had none. He was not able to
go to the drugstore and buy morphine, or
rough on rats, .or laudanum, or chloral, or
carbolic acid.
He couldn't cnt his throat. It was as
plainly impossible for him to stop up the
keyhole and turn on tbe gas. The bay
and the docks or the Oakland ferries were
as far from him as the Brooklyn bridge, so
what else was there for him to seek that
would bring death but the rail and the
cruel wheels.
Struggling to keep on hfsfeet till the
proper time, he suddenly collapsed when
he was almost under the horse's feet.
Quickly tlie streetcar stopped. The
driver had seen the aog; but there was
only two inches of space between tba dog
and the death he sought. Men jumped
from the streetcar and men ran from the
sidewalks and dragged poor Towser from
under the car. He was unconscious, and
perhaps for all poor Towser knew he was
killed by the car. Last evening at 7
o'clock he lay in the gutter dead.
GAINED MANY HONORS,
An Honorary Degree at Leipsic
Has a Very Flattering
Sequel.
Dr. Stratton 's Thesis Sought by a
Great Psychological Journal
of Europe.
The academical honors conferred in Eu
rope upon George M. Stratton are of an
exceptional sort. Borne mention has been
made of the fact that t!ie Leipsic Uni- !
versity, from which he has recently been !
graduated, conferred npon him the honor
of summa cum laude, which in itself, con
sidering all tbe circumstances, was a
mark of great distinction. The news has
just been received that Professor Wundt
has requested from Dr. Stratton bis thesis
tor publication in tbe Philosophisbe Stu
dien, which is the most important psycho
logical journal in Europe. Only authors
who are masters of their work are admit
ted to the columns of this publication, and
tbe honor of mention is eagerly coveted by â 
European students on account of tbe high
critical standard which is maintained by
its management "The fact that Dr.
Stratton'a paper has been requested," Pro
fessor Howison said yesterday, "is proof
that Dr. Btratton v considered an impor
tant person in science.^'
Professor Howiton is naturally much
pleased at tbe success abroad of Dr. Strat
ton, who was graduated in 1888 from the
department in the University of Califor
nia of which Professor Howison is the
head. Among the members of the fac
ulty of the State University who are in
Berkeley the feeling of elation is general,
because Dr. Stratton in his success also
reflected great creait abroad upon the
California institution through whicn he
pabsed. He was an industrious and bril
liant student at Berkeley, with sufficient
mental grasp ana acuteness to lead to an
ticipations of a brilliant career for him,
which anticipations he seems likely to
completely fulfill. He went to Europe
expressly to study experimental psychol
ogy, which is enpaging^ the attention of
the foremost philosophical minds of the
centers of learning in Europe and in the
United States. The shades of meaning in
philosophical discussion are so finely
drawn often that great discrimination is
necessary to make such selection as shall
convey the precise idea in the mind of the
author.
â  At Dr. Stratton was compelled, in order
to conform to the customs of the German
universities, to employ the ? German lan
guage in, the construction of his thesis, his
feat is considered doubly f* creditable. Op
nosed to him and in Competition with him
for scholastic honors were students â¢from;
all European countries, and particularly
the German students, who nave been
trained to philosophical thought and to
the most refined and accurate use of the
German language throughout their
academic career. Their advantage over
him was, therefore, very marked, but he
was fully able to uphold the credit of the
University of California, as the sequel has
amply proved.
The subject of Dr. Stratton's thesis ia
not known exactly, but it related to a
study of fundamental ratios. Coneratula
tions have been forwarded to Dr. Stratton
from this City, and also from members of
the faculty of the University of California.
Dr. Stratton ia a brother of Dr. R. T.
Stratton of Oakland and also of Attorney
r. 8. Stratton. He is making a tour
through Europe, and will soon start for
this City.
ALL FOR CHARITY.
Benevolent Institutions Whose Mana
gers Seem to Have an Kye to the
Main Chance.
In Jnly, 1889. Hiram A. Pearsons died,
leaving a holographic will, in which,
among other bequests, is a legacy "to the
different orphan asylums of the City aud
County of San Francisco, said asylums to
be designated by the Judge of the Probate
Court.' Unaer tbe provisions of the will
the court mr.de an order for the distribu
tion of $100,000 among the Roman Catholic
Orphan Asylum, the Protestant Orphan
Asylum, the Maria Kip Orphanage, tbe
St. Vincent Orphan Asylum and the Pa
cific Hebrew Orphan Asylum.
These five institutions only, out of thir
teen which applied for a share in the
legacy, were designated by the court; and
of thts remaining eight the San Francisco
Ladles' Protection and Relief Society, tbe
Armitage Orphanage, the Boys' and Girls'
Aid Society and tbe Girls' Directory ap
pealed. The first-named institution
Miss Verne Castro, Granddaughter of the Spanish General and Recent Devotee
of Ibespis.
claimed that the court Â»rred in holding
that it was not an orphan asylum and
also in holding that St. Vincent's Asylum
was a San Francisco institution. This
contention the Supreme Court seems to
regard with favor, applying it also to the
Armitane Asylum, and denies any right
on the part of the Boys'-and Girls' Aid
Society to be called an orphan asylum.
The Girls' Directory is not to bÂ« regarded
as an orphan asylum in the exact sense of
the word.
The cause was remanded, the Probate
Court being ordered to modify tne decree
in accordance with the Supreme Court's
decision.
TRADE WITH JAPAN.
Local Merchants*:, Taking I Active Steps
to .Revive Commerce.
The members of the Chanber of Com
merce and Board of Trade of San Fran
cisco, the Manufacturers' Association of
California and the Merchants' Association
are very desirous of getting bade some of
the trarie with Japan that has been grad
ually slipping out of their fingers. In
order to accomplish this a meeting has
been called at which plans will be made
for tending an active man to Japan with
a view of setting the tide of contmerce in
tbia direction again. In the call for this
meeting the committee sets forth the fol
lowing facts:
Sax Framctrco, July 15, 1896.
To the members of the chamber of Commerce and
Board of Trade of San FrancUco, the Manufac
turers' Association of California and the Ma
chants' Associationâ Gentlemen: At a confer
ence cf tb* trustees of the two organisations
first named, held this day, ii was decided, if
effective co-operation is assured, to send a
commercial commissioner to Japan ior oue
year or looser if deemed auvantageous.
We suggest that as many sub.-crioers as are
Interested subscribe to mtike up the necessary
amount, estimated nt!f4ooo,eÂ»ich contributing
a like amount, sty 100 subscribers $40 each,
or if more subscribers a less amount each.
A committee selected by them shall make the
appointment, fix compensation ami arrange
details. The primary results shall accrue to
subscribers only, they furnishing samples,
price lists and necessary Information to accom
pany them.
The establishment of a sample-room at a j
Japanese trade center will be considered.
Keports from the commissioner sent to the
committee to be accessible to all subscribers,
but he may address any subscriber as to his
particular line of business.
The committee of management will issue all
instructions to the commissioner as to his lo
cation, duties and the most approved methods
of attracting trade.
You are i nus invited to join In this effort to
extend and increase your trade in Japan, or to
open it If the field is new to you. The pian
commends itself from its economy and prac
ticability. It is suggested entirely iv your in
terest, although the subsequent results may j
inure to the general advantage of the ocean
commerce of our port.
You are respectfully requested to attend a
meeting oi the members of the organizations
herein named &t the Chamber of Commerce
HrU, Merchanu' Exchange, California street,

this effort to increase the commerce of San S
Francisco, we remain, your obedient servants, I

WILL SEEK FOR
HISTRIONIC FAME,
Granddaughter of a Spanish
General Will Go on
the Stage.
MISS CASTRO'S VENTURE.
She Will No Longer Be Known
by Her Foster Name
Allen.
ONE WEEK WEDDED TO THE AKT
She Is a Noted Society Belle of the
Three Cities Across the
Bay.
The prominent society belle of Oakland,
Berkeley and Alameda, Miss Verne Allen,
granddaughter of General Castro, will no
longer be Verne Allen, but Verne Csstro.
The reason that Miss Castro has decided
to take the honorable name of her ances
tors is because she has decided to go on
the stage. This determination will prove
a great surprise to the numerous friends
of Miss Castro, and yet from her own
affirmation she has been advised by her
friends to take this step ever since she
has been able to recite four consecutive
lines.
Her grandfather was one of the old
Spanish generals and was a Castiiian of
Castile, a representative of a nobility par
excellence. Moreover, her granduncle
was Alvarado, one of the first governors
of Spanish California.
Miss Castro has just graduated from
Mills College. She has much musical
talent and a voice that ia rich in tone and
feeling. She has been under Mr. Belasco
only a few weeks, yet recently rendered
before her friends Cora of "Article 47"
with such a power and knowledge of emo
tional expression that, it is said, had it
been in public it would have made her
famous.
Next month she will read "Camille" at

a reception given to David Bolasco on his
arrival in this City.
She is strongly emotional and aspires to
shine in society dramas and classic pieces.
"I love the excitement and exhilaration
of standing before an audience," said she
yesterday. "The turning point of my life,
or the moment that really decided me on
becoming an actress, was when I delivered
the Rhetorical at Mills College. I was not
in the least afraid, but when I had finished
I wanted to go back again upon the stage.
1 want people to know me hereafter by my
real nameâ Verne Castroâ not Allen. I
intend to add more fame to that narve if
possible."
Miss Castro's aunts bad the name of
being the most beautiful women in this
State, and it is very apparent that Miss
Castro inherits much of this trait herself.

RICHMOND MADE HAPPY,
Red Rock in Active Demand
With the People West of
the Cemeteries,
Real Estate Has Taken a Jump of
More Than Twice Its Value
in Ten Years.
Since the law allowing red-rock pave
ments went into effect the Richmond dis
trict has assumed a thorough business
like dash. Now Point Lobos avenue is
traversed by dozens of teams hauling red
rock from the quarry at tnÂ« Cliff all over
the district for sidewalks and other
needed improvements, whereas previous to
its passage not one load was hauled to
this section.
As an example of the sudden revival in
improvements the Odd Fellows' Cemetery
Association has given a contract for 3000
loads of red rock with which a concrete
wail is being put round that portion
of the cemetery where the sandhill stood
prior to its removal to fill up the hollow
on the inside of the old racetrack.
A contract has been let by the property
owners on Sixth avenue, from B to Point
Lobos, to Felix McHugh for the construc
tion of a sewer at ninety cents a foot,
which involves about $1500. But on this
undertaking McHugh ran across a snag;
bis bid was made upon the expectation
that he would find a sandy bottom through
which he would run his sewer, but instead
he found blue rock and hard clay "which
will leave him out of pocket quite a large
sum as the sewer must go according to
specifications.
By the way of a comparison on thÂ« in
creased value of real estate in Richmond
district during the past ten years, T. G.
Parker, a real estate agent in this
valley, sold a corner lot on Fourth avenue
and Clement street in 1886 for $1300.
The same lot was sold by the same agent
a few weeks ago to C. B. Ryer for $3750.
Upon this lot a $6000 building will be im
mediately erected. Nor is this an excep
tion." Lots that J. J. O'Brien sold for $100
a lot some few years ago are now beinjÂ»
sold for $1000 for inside and $1500 for cor
ner lots.
The sandeaters of "Warren & Malley are
getting away with tha mounds in that
vicinity. The two paddies at work remove
45,000 cubic yards of sand every day.
This is being hauled away upon railroad
flatcars propelled by horsepower and
dumped into the hollow which stood in
the center of the Bay View racetrack since
the days of Noah and his family.
When this tract of land is filled in and
the avenues and streets laid out, it will be
one of the choicest building sites in the
district.

DAVE NEAGLE'S GRIP.
A. J. Collins' Recital of His
Grievances Suddenly In
terrupted.
CtAIMS HE WAS ILL TREATED.
Seeks Redress for Having Baen Put
Off a Train in the Colorado
Desert.
. Â An exciting scene was witnessed yester
day in front of., the Union Trust building,
at Montgomery and Post streets, between
ex-De<puty United States Marshal David
Neagle, who is in the 1 employ of the
â¢ Southern Pacific Company, and Andrew
J. Collins, an ex-employe of the .company,
who has on various occasions called on
. several of the railroad officials to state his
-..grievances and to ask for redress."
According to Collins' story he jyas walk
,ing up and down on tie sidewalk in front
; ;joi the railroad building yesterday, trying
to sell a razor-sharpening preparation j
â to passers-by, when H. Â£. Huntington
. . and Ner.gle approached. Huntington
â" spoke to Collins, who has called several
.";times on the railroad magnate, but Col- |
iins. rankling under what he thought had '.
beeii .injustice on Huntington's, part, re- j
â¢ : fused to answer. Soon he changed hist
mind, however, and began to .speak to I
Huiitinpton in regard to his grievance j
against the company.
"I. was not making any threats at all," [
â¢ declared Collins yesterday evening. "In j
: fact; I bad closed my grip and was stand
;'ing with my arms folded in order that I
ijhere might be no appearance whatever of
violence on my part. 1 was just telling
Mr. Huntington that I had been a faithful
.employe of the company when this man
Neagle caught me by the throat with one
hand and by the wrist with the other and
forced me toward the edge of the sidewalk.
At the same time he threatened with an
oath to kill me if I came around bother
,ving the railroad people again.
"I thought at the time tbat the man was
an officer, sol submitted to the indignity.
If I had known then who he was 1 should
certainly not have allowed him to treat '
â¢me as he did. It was as flagrant a piece j
of unwarranted brutality as I ever saw in
my Hie."
H. E. Huntington, when seen shortly
after the occurrence yesterday afternoon, j
was inclined to make light of the matter.
"There were no threats nor any attempts
at violence," he said. "Yes, this is 'the
same man who created a similar scene '
several weefts ago. He imagines he has a j
grievance against the company and he |
conies around here seeking redress.
"I think the man is a little 'off. 1 I have j
heard that he stabbed his own mother, and j
naturally I don't care that he should try
the same thing on me."
J. A. Fillmore,- general manager of the
company, gave the history of Collins' con- j
section with the company. "Some five or j
six years ago." he said- 'â¢Collins was hurt,
through his own fault, at Los Angeles.
'â¢". . "After he recovered he came around after
.. work and we gave him a position in the
shops at Tucson. He got into so much
trouble and made such a disturbance
'.;â â .. among the employes that we finally had
. .to let him out. On his way back from
â ;â¢;. Tucson he claims ne was put off a train
â¢â â¢â  -and suffered greatly, and now demands
; . .some compensation. He wants money
â¢ ..without work. If he attempts to black
: ..mail us. however, he will find that he has
'"/Corner to the wrong building."
;;â¢ Collins denies that he was' discharged at j
â  .. -Tucson. "There were a number of us I
..; laid off." be said, "ostensibly for the pur
' '.pose of e^nomy. As a matter of fact,
â  however, while I was wording 'at Tucson
, 'everything possible was done to make
â¢â¢â¢â - "things disagreeable for me and to compel
. me to quit, bnt I worked on.
: â â -' â¢ "When I was Jaid eff I started back for
thp City. I was denied a pass or an em
ploye's* ticket, although the other em- ;
vloyes were given them. Whiie cro^sin
the Colorado Desert I was put off the train
and my sufferings there in the terrific
August heat were something fearful.
After I had finally reached this City I
wrote to Mr. Kruttschnitt, who was then
connected with the company, asking to be
compensated for the sufferings I had un
dergone. He answered me that inasmuch
as the matter had occurred before his ad
ministration he could do nothing in the
matter.
"Since then I have at various thneÃ tried i
to see H. E. Huntington. Not long ago I !
saw Mr. Worihinxton, Huntington's pri- !
vate secretary, who told me that Hunting
ton woald see that I should receive what
ever was just and fair, but I have been un
able to learn anything further, although I {
have tried several times to see Huntington. !
"When I taiked of suiDg the company
Worthlneton said I might as well knock
my head against a stone wall as to sue '
tiie company.
"They had me arrested for threatening
to kill, and although there was no evi
dence against me I was held over in Judge
Joachimsen's court, and after spending
over two months in the County Jail was
allowed to go free on bonds.
"I was thrown down by my attorney,
who promised ti see that I should be re
leased on habeas corpus. When finally I
gotoutof jail I was penniless and sick,
and since then I have been trying to make
a living selling things on the street.
"I was a.ways a good workman while in
the company's employ, and I have quite a !
number of recommendations from various
persons for whom I have worked. I was
not making any threats or using violence
this morning, but was merely asking for
what I thought just when Neagle brutally
interfered."
CONSIDERED A DISTURBER.
Brodowski's Charge Against Dr. MeAl-
J . lister. Found to Have No â 
Ground. .
The directors of the Veterans' Home
have investigated the recent charges of
cruelty made against Dr. W. F. McAllister
of the Veterans' Home at Yountville, and
have found them to be void and without
foundation.
The record of Brodowski shows that he
had been twice discharged from the home
for infractions of the rules, and the base
of the charges against the physician and
the directors, who are accused of shield
ing him, are traced to his animus. The
directors had refused to pay him an al
leged claim growing out of an assignment
lacking in legal formality, and, smarting
under this supposed grievance, be made a
general charge of mismanagement against
those in authority.

brought suit against L.S. J. Hunt to recover
$050 due on a promissory note, judgment for

Court in June, 1895. It is claimed that Hunt
is about to leave for China, with the inientloo
01 deirauding bis creditors, aud liis arrest hai,
therefore, been ordered.

plead for the school.
At the special session this afternoon ex- >
Judge J. F. Sullivan, ' who has been re
tained as counsel by Miss Manning, will i
appear and argue that to abolish the Web

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JULY Â»1, 1896.
a real estate job and of personal animus
against Mi.Â«s Manning, the principal, but
neither of these statements seems to rest
upon a truthful basis. An honest differ
ence of opinion is- most likely the casus
belli. It is claimed that the lot in the
rear of the Lincoln Grammar School. is not
a suitable site for a. school ; that the build
ings are old and dilapidated, and that the
real estate is so valuable that it could bo
leased at a profit to the department if
cleared of the old buildings which now
incumber it.
In answer to these arguments the friends
of the school say that it is centrally lo
cated, is attended by a greater number of
children than any other primary school
in the City and that the buildings are in
no worse condition than many others in
the department. All they need is a little
repairing. The value -of the school lots at
the corner of Fifth and Market streets is
admitted, but it, is that there
would be any financial profit in tearing
down the Webster Primary at this time.
As things are now the Board of Educa
tion has power to lease the lots at Market
and Fifth streets for only ten years, and
it Is argued that in consequence no great
profit could be expected from a lease.
The Lincoln Evening School, the largest
and most successful in the United States,
has thirty-six classes. Half of these find
accommodation in the Lincoln Grammar
and the other half in the Webster Primary.
Of course, the destruction of the Webster
would break up the elegant organization
of the Lincoln Evening School, and for
this reason, also, the contemplated clos
ing of the Webster is held to be unwise
and premature. â¢ -
A general feeling of uneasiness prevails
among the thirty-five teachers, many of
whom would be likely to serve for an in
definite term upon the substitute list,
despite the assurances of the Directors to
the contrary. Miss Manning has riled a
written protest with the Board of Educa
tion against the discontinuance of the
Webster Primary, in the course of which
she says:
I have been informed that yon intend to
adopt a resolution transferring me from the
principalship of the Webster Primary to the
principalship of the Jefl'orfon Primary or some
other school of the grade of the latter and
with less emolument than said Webster Pri
mary. Under the law governing sali Board of
Education and defining the rights of teachers
you have not any authority to deprive me of
my office of principal of a seventeen-clasa pri
mary school nor deprive me of the salary at
tached to such office. The Supremo Court hss
held that the rights of teachers must ba held
inviolate where they have not forfeited their
right to office on proper charges after a proper
trial.
I hereby protest that your threatened action
is wrongful and unlawful. It will amount to
an unlawful invasion of my rights, for which I
must hold you accountable in such manner
and to such extent as the law of the State
allows.
Concerning the rights of teachers Miss
Manning's allusions to the decision of the
Supreme Court of California in the case of
Kate Kennedy vs. The Board of Education,
January 9, 1880, is true, but in its decision
the court said: "It may be well to say
that cases may arise in which a teach-r
cannot compel the Board of Education to
continue his employment and enforce pay
ment of his salary. For example, when
the school in which he is teaching is abol
ished, or from any other reason the posi
tion has ceased to exist. But no auch
question is presented here."
There is no parallel between the ease of
Kate Kennedy and that of Miss Manning
and the only part of the Supreme Court
decision applicable in the case of the prin
cipal of the Webster is that above quoted.
THE CHARTER CONVENTION.
A Large Gathering of Delegates From
the Improvement Clubs.
The Merchants' Association has just re
ceived official notice of the appointment
of the following additional delegates to
the Charter Convention to be held on
August 12: The Van Ness Avenue Im
provement Club has appointed Herbert E.
Law and J. J. McGovern. The Pacific
Coast Commercial Travelers' Association
has appointed W. F. Peterson and A. C.
Boldemann. The Germania Club has ap
pointed F. Sachs and F. Rathjens. The
E. Van Hendel Lodge has appointed Val
entin Acker and Kicolaus Trost. The
Eureka Lodge of Hermann's Sons has ap-
Dointed C. Leidecker and Dr. G. Gutsch.
These delegates will represent their re
spective organizations at the Charter Con
vention. A number of other associations
bava announced their intention of sending
delegates. From all indications the Char
ter Convention will be one of the mo*t
representative assemblages of prominent
citizens that have ever been field in San

THE CEDARBANK
AGAIN ON FIRE,
About Three Years Ago
She Came Into Port
All Ablaze.
CREW WAS POWERLESS.
They Could Not Control the Con
flagration Until Help Was
Sent Them.
IT WAS A NABROW ESCAPE.
As It Is the Underwriters Will Have
to Pay Over Ten Thousand
Dollars.
The water front was thoroughly excited
fdr the first time in two months yesterday.
The British ship Cedarbank, at Howard
street wharf, was afire and a stiil alarm
drew all the Harbor Commissioners' fire
boats and the Spreckeis tugs to the rescue.
The Alert and Vigilant both made a rush
for the ship, but the State tngs were
nearest, and when the Alert arrived the
fire was under control.
Superintendent Hawley of the "Black
Stack" line was one of the first men on
the scene and he rendered valuable assist
ance in directing the men at work. The
damage will probably amount to $10,000
and the underwriters will have to stand
the loss.
The Cedarbank arrived here on the 22d
inst. with a general cargo from Antwerp.
In the forward hold was a laree quantity
of bottles cased in straw for the use of the
English syndicate breweries in this State.
Since "free trade" obtained these bottles
have been imported from Germany, and
every lager- beer bottle opened in San
Francisco is manufactured in Germany.
Thousands of those bottles were ruined in
yesterday's fire, and while the foreign un
derwriters may lose the local glatsblowers
may gain.
The forward hold of the Cedarbank is
fall of inflammable goods, while the after
part of the ship is fnll of cement.
Tom Mulvey of W. P. Fuller & Co. was
the first man to notice that the Cedarbank
was on fire. He did not waste any words,
but at onco ran and Informed Captain
Brown, Superintendent of the State's tugs.
Brown telephoned to the Governor Mark
ham, and in ten minutes Captain J. F.
Petzinger had her under way. In enter
ing the Howard-street slip Captain Petz
inger found that a breast line from the
coal barge Courser barred his way. He
did not hesitate an instant, but cut the line
away and a few minutes later bad a stream
playing into the Cedarbank's hold.
Captain Moody was anxious to save all
lie could and attempted to drown the fire
from the main hatch. He only succeeded
in a measure, and it was only when a
great quantity of cargo was removed and
the fore Hold flooded that the fire was got
under.
The cement in the after part of the ship
will be subjected to a general average. The
bulk of it is as good as ever, but a consid
erable portion has been injured by water,
and is therefore almost useless. Just how
the vessel caught fire is a mystery, but
the general impression is that some of the
longshoremen or apprentices were smok
ing in the hold during the lunch hour
and a spark fell into the straw and it
smoldered until the fire broke out into a
blazing mass.
This is the second time the Cedarbank
has been on fire in the bay of San Fran
cisco. About three years ago Captain
Moody was bringing her from Newcastle,
N. S. W., with a cargo of coal. When
thirty-two days from port the coal caught
fire and for a full month the crew fought
it. Time and again tha men were driven
forward, but when a lull came they went
back to the main deck and shoveled coal
out of the burning masÂ«.
When the Farallones were reached Cap
tain Moody ordered the hatches battened
down and at once accepted a tow. Once
at anchor he sent ashore for assistance.
The "bank" line seems to always meet
with misfortunes in San Francisco. The
Etmbankwason fire witb a cargo of mil
ptmr at Union-street wharf many years
ugo and the salvage claims are not yet
settled. The Gowanbank met with* a
number of misfortunes, and now comes
the Cedarbank for her second experience.
OR, KUHLMAN DID
NOT GO TO JAIL
The Physician Refused
to Testify at an
Inquest.
A LEGAL TECHNICALITY.
He Would Not Answer the
Questions Put by Coroner
Hawkins.
NO LIGHT ON SONDERUP'S CASE.
Autopsy Physic'an Barrett's Micro
scopical Â£zaminatioa of Sonde
rup's Spinal Cord.
Dr. Charles Kuhlman was in the Coro
ner's office yesterday when Coroner
Hawkins resumed the inauest into the
death of Jens W. Sonderup. But the doc
tor refused positively to teatify. TUe re
sult was the inquest had to be adjourned
indefinitely, and Dr. Kuhlman was com
mitted to the County Jail for thirty days
for contempt. He smiled as t\e went away
with a Deputy Sheriff to the City Hall.
When called by the Coroner to the wit
ness-chair Dr. Kulilman hesitated.
"I would like to make a statement be
fore I proceed any further," ne said. "I
wish to state that I have simply come
here as a matter of courtesy to the office,
and inasmuch as I am advised and do
thoroughly believe that these proceedings
are unlawful, and in as much as I could
give no information beyond what is sat
forth in my death certificate, filed accord
ing to law, but as to what would be in the
nature of professional confidences, I re
spectfully decline to be sworn and tes
tify."
"Dr. Kuhlman, this is an inquest to de
termine whether or not a crime has been
committed in the City and County of San
Francisco, and your testimony is neces
sary. Now, I want your testimony in this
case, and for tbat reason you will have to
be sworn. Do you refuse to be sworn and
testify in this case?" asked Coroner Haw
kins.
"Yes; for the reasons I have set forth I
respectfully decline to be sworn," replied
Kuhlman.
"Dr. Kuhlman, for your said refusal you
are adjudged cuilty of contempt," was tbe
Coroner's rejoinder, "and sentenced to the
County Jail for tbe term of thirty days."
Dr. Kuhlman requested the shorthand
reporter to read his notes of the state
ment, whereupon a Deputy Sheriff took
Kuhlman in custody, and the jury was er
cused until called again by the Coroner.
Jens W, Sonderup was attended by Dr.
Kuhlman, who in the death certificate
stated that Sonderup died of ''progressive
traumatic cerebro-spinal ataxia and
paralysis." Thia certificate was not ac
cepted by the Health Department when
presented for a burial persnit, and tbe
Coroner was instructed to hold'an inquest
and autopsy. Dr. Barrett, the autopsy
physician, who made the post-mortem ex
amination, testified that Sonderup had
died of consumption. Sonderup's widow
then claimed that her husband's death
had resulted from injuries sustained in a
street railway accident on Kearny street.
Dr. Kuhlmnn corroborated her assertion,
but refused to give any information to tbe
Coroner.
For this refusal he was judged guilty of
contempt and sentenced to ten days in
the County Jail. His attorney took the
case tn the Superior Court on an appeal,
but on the eighth day the sentence was
confirmed and Dr. Kuhlman spent one
day and a half in jail.
Yesterday's proceedings were held to
give the physician an opportunity to tes
tify, but as he again refused, the Coroner
once more committed him for contempt.
Dr. Barrett stated yesterday that he had
made a microscopial examination of
Sonderup's brain and spinal cord, both of
which ho had saved in their entirety. In
endeavoring to detect if there was any
degeneration such as would indicate in
jury, or what Dr. Kuhlman gave as the
cause of death, he was unsuccessful. On
the contrary in bis search he found the
bacilli of tuberculosis in the dura.
Dr. Kuhlman and his attorney pro
ceeded from the Morgue to Judge Dain
gerfieid's court, where the case was con
sidered by the Judge.
The arguments indulged in were long
and tiresome. It took nearly three hours
to hear all there was to be said. When
the matter was finally submitted his
Honor summed up the whole matter by
saying that the Coroner's contention was
that he had a right to commit a man for
contempt upon his order being counter
signed by a Judge of the Superior Court.
It was found, however, that under sec
tion 19 of the Political Code the Coroner
has power to subpena any person whom
he believes to have some knowledge of a
matter under inquisition. In this case
the order of arrest did not show tbat the
Coroner believed Dr. Kuhlman had "this
knowledge, hence the doctor was dis
charged. _________â_____
"UNCLE GEORGE" IS WELL
The Venerable Bohemian Given
an Ovation at His
Club.
Li Hung Chang and Henry Irving
Apprised of His First Sick
ness.
"Uncle" George T. Bromley was back
again in Bohemia yesterday. That is, he
gave his old companions a most agreeable
surprise by rising as it were from the oros
tration of colic, caused by indulging too
freely in homo cooking, and appearing
one* more in the Bohemian Club. Uncle
George is himself again, and thereby hangs
a tale.
The Call published a week ago the fact
that Mr. Brom well was seized in the middle
of the night at a friend's summer home in
Belvedere with violent pains in his
stomach. For nearly three days the attack
continued without abatement, and then
the symptoms were alarming, so much so
indeed that at one time grave doubts
were entertained as to his recovery. But
then Uncle ueorge had youth and strength
on bis side, and in an incredibly short
time he was well again. To be sure he is
now very close to his eightieth birthday,
and this was Uncle George's first sicknesa.
Hts most intimate friends in the Bohe
mian CJub who saw him during his illness
at Belvedere said it almost frightened him
to death, but being one of the boya he
threw it off anyhow.
'â¢It will be a long time again until I get
sick, he remarked yesterday in the club
dining-room, and he looked wistfully at
the familiar menu and vowed that noth
ing would tempt him to stray away to a
mixture of deviled crab and "sliced pine
apple.
The Bohemians crowded around the
venerable comradeâ the oldest and vet
youngest of them all. They (airly over
powered him with congratulations and
various ways of sxpressing delight at his
return. And Uncle George was never so
happy. He had a large pile of letters
written him by members of the Bohemian
Club while he was sick, and these he Uis
played with pride.
Incidentaly, as an illustration of how Mr.
Bromley is resarded all over the world, it
was remarked yesterday in the club that
conies of Tue Call containing an account
of his sudden illness were sent to all parts
of the civilized world. One copy was sent
to Li Hung Chang, the Chinese premier,
another to a distinguished official at Tien
tsin, China, and others to the Lamb
Club, New York, where Harry Gilly, Joe
Redding, Frank Unger, Ned Townsend and
other oju-time Bohemians patlier; also to
the Union League and the Lotus clubs of
New York; the Ritterhonae Club, Phila
delphia; the Union League and Calumet
Clubs, Chicago; tbe Boston Club, New Or
leans; Univer&ity Club, St. Louis; Butter
Olub, Sacramento, and the Jonathan Club
or Los Angeles. A marked copy went to
Henry Irving, Lyceum Theater, London,
and still more copiet to the antipodes,
to Japan, Honolulu, Paris, Liverpool and
Aylesbury, England; and one to South
Africa. In all these places are olub men
who have the warmest regard for Uncle
George.

HIS MOTHER COMPLAINED
James Crowley, Painter, Ar
rested on the Charge of
Insanity.
He Says It Is a Scheme to Get
Possession of His Prop
erty.
An extraordinary case of the alleged
persecution of a son by his mother was
brought to light Wednesday and the facts
will be related to the Insanity Commis
sioners this morning.
James Crowley, a painter living at 1008
Pacific avenue, was arrested on tha com*
plaint of his mother, who charged him
with being insane. He was booked at the
City Prison and then taken to the Receiv
ing Hospital, where he was placed In a
padded cell.
Drs. Thompson an* Stice talked with
Crowley on different subjects for some
time and they were convinced that Crow
ley was in full possession of his senses.
In explanation of his arrest, Crowley
said that bis mother had for some time
been annoying him to deed over to he*
his property at 1608 Pacific avenue, where
he and his lamily of eleven children lived.
rie had refused to grant her request, and
ne supposed she had taken this means to
get him out of tba way so she could gain
possession of the property.
Attorney Hull, a friend of Crowiey,
laid the facts before Judge Dainge,ro.dd,
who went with him to tie hospital, and
after conversing a few minutes with the
prisoner the Judge released him on his
own recognisance.
Crowley is a brother of Dan Crowley,
tha wharfinger, and one of the best-known
politicians in the City.
Directors Ousted.
The petition of. Mrs. Eleanor L. White to
oust the directors of the American Composi
tion Pipe and Pile Armor Company was heard
by Judge Hebbard yesterday and the petition
granted. A stay of execution for ten days was,
however, allowed.
This Is the suit filed several days ago in
which ii was claimed that at & meeting of thÂ«
stockholders ot the company sufficient shares
of stock were voted to unseat the present board
of directors, but that the president, by illegal
means, threw out enough vote* to retain him
self and fellow-directors in office.

A POPULIST ON
WATSON AND BRYAN
State Secretary Bush Speaks
for the "Middle of
the Road."
SAYS VOTE FOR WATSON
The Vital Issues of the Party
Mr. Bryan Refuses to
Discuss. . .
THE TIGER WILL BE SICE.
A Call to the Party to Stand by
Watson ana Save the Popu
list Cause.
There is a large majority in the Populist
party of California which is disgusted with
the action of the St. Louis convention and
which is not disposed to let the party be
wholly digested and assimilated by the
Democratic tiger.
They will stand by Watson for Vice-
President at least, as this is all that is left
to them. Most of the party leaders take
this stand. One of tnem is K. Â£. Bush,
secretary of the Populist State Central
Committee, who expresses his attitude in
the following manner:
If Watson, then Bryan. Let events come.
If Sewall should insist, and If Bryan should
continue to demand Sewall's indorsement, we, .
the Populists, may yet have a straight ticket.
Who knows but that the voters of tliis Nation
may- even elect and seat a Populist President
to succeed G (old) Cleveland?
The Great American Nation in the first cen
tury of its 'existence spoke four times; and
then spoke only in the thunder tones of war.
Must Americans always speak by bloodshed?
No, and in fact the votes of 1892 and 1894 are
merely the unsteady efforts of au aroused
people endeavoring to determine public poli
cies by displacing political administrations.
And the action of our National Convention in
naming Watson is an indication of a more di
rect control in the future by the people of
public policies through the initiative and
referendum.
There are those who prefer a straight ticket,
and for this reason a straight ticket was in
, our opinion the best preparation for an endur
ing public approval of the political demands
mentioned in our Omaha platform of 1896.
But our time as straight-gut Texans had not
come on July 25. Our time is now come,
fellow-Populists.
The fight is now on between greedy selfish
ness and hr.mau life. As individuals you and
I were lost in the great mass of citizens who
B waited the decision of that last convention.
But our party grows. Our duty ia upon us, a
burden, a responsibility greater than that
thrown at us by the Democrats of Chicago.
Remember you not their cry in public, "Here,
indorse our man, or you Populists by your re
fusal do endanger the cause ot silver?"" Now
wo Populists say â¢with the Southern delegates,
â¢â¢Vote lor Watson, or you Democrats by refus
ing are endangering the cause of American
liberty." Who now says that Populists alone
are responsible for the election dr defeat of
MoKiniey? Are we in a majority? Were we
ever responsible alone?
A political party, unless it Is dead, is ahead
of its platform. A candidate is usually up to
his party and always should be abreast of his
platform. Mr. Bryan is reported to have said
that he will not discuss some of the issues in
the People's party platform of 1896. What arÂ«
these issues?
If it is true that the Democratic tiger has
swallowed Populist silver ideas will not the
tiger be torn to pieces when the silver fulmin
ate explodes by the idea of Government own
ership and operation of public utilities ?
Of course, Populists know that persona and
private corporations do business for private
gain and that taxes cannot be levied for pri
vate purposes directly. You know that public
corporations, like towns and school districts,
do collect taxes and do make a private profit
for their citizens. The large number oi cor
porations that are in politics are of anothar
sort. They are quasi-public corporations,
These not only make profit*, but they do so by
means of the backing they have from the Gov
ernment, which other citizens and other cor
porations do not have.
A private citizen cannot coin money or con
demn and take private property for his use.
If the Federal tax of 10 per cent per annum on
the issues of State banks were removed by Con
gressâas desired by many Democrats in
1894-95â numerous State banks would issue
bank currency, as they did before 186 G. Na
tional banks to-day issue such currency, aud
because oi the scarcity of money issued Dy the
General Government," this currency is and
would be used by the people in their daily
trade. Mr. Bryan stands on his platform in
opposition to thii bank money; but the Bank
ers' Association for years has been clamoring
for the complete control of the issuance of
money by the banks instead of the Govern
ment. The bankers point to the Clearing
house statistics to show that 92 per cent of the
business of the country is now done by bank
discounts and bills of exchange, etc., ana argue
that the banks should be given full control ot
the issuance of the money. In a negative way
the banks, through the scarcity of money and
their endeavor to keep it scarce, are using the
power to coin money for the gain of their stock
holders. Therefore the discount cnarged by
the bank is virtually a tax for private purposes.
The issuance of National money is one of
the most important of public utilities. Taxes
are paid in money. There must be a sufficient
amount of money provided by the Government
for the use of its citizens in business, whereby
the citizen may labor without hindrance or
discount nnd from the results of his labor pay
his tax. See section 3 of the Populist plank
on finance. Will Mr. Bryau discuss this ques
tion ?
But the greater number of quasi-public cor
porations are engaged in providing the public
with gas, water, electricity, fares, freights
and telegrams and phones. All of these cor
porations are run for gain and all depend upon
their power to condemn their right of way
and their privilege of fixing their rates so as
to earn a good dividend. Tnese corporations
are in politics to protect their special privi
leges. As Benton said of the National bank of
his time, "You cannot bell that cat." And
like that old bank these corporations by vari
ous means escape taxation, tan these modern
corporations be controlled at all except by
ownership and operation by either city, county
State or Nation? Will Mr. Bryan discuss this
issue? His-very refusal to discuss the ques
tion of taxation for private gain will lead to a
full discussion thereof.
Populists know that "the power to tax is the
power to destroy," and the most hideous tax
Is an indirect tax. Populists know that the
Government can control only what it owns
not what owns it. Therefore be ye ready for a
straig-.t campaign on basic principles. If
Watson, ibeu Bryan.
Onr Populist Yke-President is not a nonen
tity. Watson stands for Populism, and Pop
ulism stands for the 12,003,4. " fr.miiies in the
Dnitod States whose yearly incomes are mirier
$3<KK> (see Arena, pege 6UO, March, 1896).
Wat*on announces that he drill not withdiaw.
Says he:
"if Mr. Bryan (and the Democracy) did not
want our support Senator Jones had no busi
ne- i.t St. Louis. If the Democrats (and Mr,
Re\Yall)are so unreasonabl" as to refuse us
Populists of the South (and elsewhere) any
recognition at all, tnat fact would show that
thÂ« real purpose of the apparent adoption of
our lirinciples is to kill our party and not to
enact those principles into the law "

A GIFT IN V IEW OF DEATH.
Judge Coffey's Decision as to What
31akeÂ« It Legal.
In passing on the case of the estate of
Patrick Curtis vs. Reddy, Judge Coffey
yesterday rendered a decision as to what
constitutes "donatio causa mortis" â a gift
in view of death.
His Honor said that in order for such a
giit to be valid, live conditions must ob
tain â first, the gift must be made with a
view to the donor's death; second, the
donor must die of the present ailment;
third, there must be an actual delivery to
the donee; fourt'-, there must bean ac
ceptance of the gift; iifth, all the elements
must concur or transpire during the iile
time of the <ionor.
Judge Coffey also said, however, that
the irobate Court had no jurisdiction or
power to decide a question of title to prop
erty in a proceeding of this kind.
The application of the plaintiff was
therefore denied and the citation dis
missed.
MAIL LIMIT REVISED.
Weight of Fourth- Class Matter In
Finally Fixed at Four
Pounds.
Postmaster McCoppin was yesterday no
tified by the department at Washington
that in future fourth-class mail matter
must not exceed four pounds in weight.
The ruling is retarded as an important
one for the reason that heretofore printed
or written official matter regardlem of
weight has been accepted at the various
offices. The circular of the Postmaster-
General reads as follows:
Section 320, Postal Laws and Regulations, is
hereby amended in accordance with the pro
visions of the act of Congress approved June
8, 1896, to read as follows:
lli at mailable mutter of the fourth class shall
embrtce all matter not embraced in the first, sec
ond or third class which Is not in its form or na
ture liable to destroy, deface or otherwise damage
the contents of the mail bag or harm the person of
any one engaged in the postal service, and Is not
above the weight provided by law, which is hereby
declared to iÂ«- no: exceeding four pounds for each
package thereof, except in case of single books
weighing in excess of tnat amount, and except for
books and documents punlisue or circulated by
ord>-r of Congress, or printed or written official
matter emanating from any of the departments of
the Government or from the Smithsonian Insti
tution, or which is not declared unmailable under
the provisions of section 3893 of the Uevlsed
Statutes as amended by the act of July 12, 187tf,
or matter appertaining to lotteries, gift concerts or
fraudulent schemes or devices.
Postmasters, except at the City of Washing
ton. D. C, are instructed to decline to accept
for mailing packages offered to them weighing
in excess of the limit provided by law, whethet
such packages are presented as free matter by
officers oi the Government, under the penalty
label, or prepaid as third or fourth class mat
ter.
The limit of weight does not apply to second
class matter mailed at the pound rate of post
age, or at the rate of one cent for eacfl four
ounces, nor will it be enforced at present
against matter fully prepaid with postage
stamps affixed at the first-class (letter) rate of
postage.
Special instructions will be Issued to the
postmaster at Washington, D. C.

A NEW TRANSFER POINT.
Western Addition and Kearny
Street Cars Exchange Pas
sengers.
The Change Will Take Effect on Satur
day and Many Will Be Bene
fited.
Over a year ago the officers and mem
bers of the Merchants' Association peti
tioned General Manager Vining of the
Market-street Railway Company to issue
transfers to its patrons on several of the
large street-car lines. Several committees
from the association called upon the man
ager, and in several instances they ob
tained con sessions at new transfer points.
Wednesday another concession was ob
tained from the general manager which
will be hailed with pleasure by large num
bers living in the Western Addition and
the Mission. The following letter from
Mr. Vining is self-explanatory:
San Fbancisco. July 28, 1896.
Merchants' Atsociatiun, Mills Building, City:
Gentlemenâ We wili, on August 1, commence
a trial of tne plan suggested by your associa
tion of giving transfers from eastbound Sacra
mento and Jackson-street cars to southbound
cars of the two electric lines running upon
Kearny street, aid also giving transfers from
nortnbound cars of said electric lines to west
bound Sacramento and Jackson-street cars;
subject, however, to the provision that passen
gers traveling on the Sacramento and Jackson-
Ftreet lines, upon transiers received from
northbound connecting cars, will not be given
transfers to southbound connecting cars.
This last mentioned provision seems to be
the only practicable means by which the mak
ing of round trips for a single fare can be pre
vented; and as Kearny and Powell street have
only two streets between them we believe that
it will be practicable for our conductors to en
force this provision without rf quiring, as it
is necessary to do upon our Filimore-stroet
line, that transfers shall be issued only at the
time when the fare is settled for.
As stated in previous correspondence, we
have been very anxious to comply with the
wishes of your association upon the subject.
It was unfortunately the case, when the
matter was first presented for consideration,
that the traffic in transfers then existing con
stituted so grave a difficulty as to make it im
possible for us at that time to comply with
your request.
Now that the attention of the public has
been called to this evil and it has been so
strongly condemned by public opinion as to
lead to the enactment of an ordinance making
the traffic in transfers illegal, we believe that
the situation hus been so grently improved
that we can cow adopt the above-mentioned
change with advantage to all concerned.
With pleasure that we are now able, as above
stated, to comply with'your request, 1 remain
as ever, yours sincerely,
E. P. Vncnra, Genpral Manager.
In acknowledging the favor the associa
tion's letter stated:
These additional transfer facilities will cer
tainly be of great benefit to and much ap
preciated by the merchants on Kearny street
as well as the residents of the Western Ad
dition, and. no doubt, by the public in general
and we hope the trial will prove so satisfactory
to all concerned that the service will be
permanent
In order that the traveling public may
not make a mistake one sentence in Mr.
Vining's letter requires explanation. Pas
sengers traveling on the Sacramento and
Jackson street lines on transfers issned on
the Mission or Third street electric cars on
Kearny street will not be given transfers
to the Powell-street cable-cars bound
south nor to the Fillmore electric line
bound to the Mission. This is to prevent
people from boarding a Mission-street car
and riding to Powell or Fillmore retrans
fering so as to reach Nf arket street or the
Mission on one fare, or, in other words
riding around the loop.
The Merchants' Association officers are
in hopes that before lon-: transfers will be
issued between the Market and Kearny
street lines.
A DOG THAT HOWLS.
Edwin Mohrig , Proprietor of a Cyclery,
Arrested for Maintaining a
Nniinnce.
Edwin Mohrig, proprietor of a cyolery
at 110 Golden GÂ»te avenue, was arrested
Wednesday afternoon on a warrant charg
ing him with maintaining a nuisance.
He at once cave $40 cash bail.
Mohrig owns a dog which he keeps in
the cyciery and numerous complaints
were received by the police from residents
on Jones street and the avenue near the
cyclery about the howling of the animal.
They declared they could not sleep at
night and when they complained to Mr.
Mohrig he told them he had a perfect
right to keep a dog if he felt so inclined,
and refused to take it away from the
cyclery.
Policeman Connolly was detailed to in
duce Mohrig to stop the howling nuisance,
but Mohrig told him he would stand on
his rights as a citizen and taxpayer to
keep a dog or a dozen dogs.
As the police could not compel Moh rig
to part with his dog M. Marcom, 117
Jones street, swore to a complaint in
Judge Conlan s court yesterday charging
him with maintaining a nuisance. Own
ers of dogs will watch the result with
interest.
Suit for I>araagÂ«i.
Pmkus Harris, father of Benjamin Harris,
the niessanger-boy who was kUed tome time
ago by failing down the elevator t-Liaft of a
building at the corner of Stockton street and
Btockton place, has sued William F. Wilson
and Charlei L. Taylor, owners of the building
whtire thu accident occurred, ior $50,000 dam
ages, alleging thnt it was because of careless
ness on the part of their employes that the boy
was killed.

The Olympic Club gymnasium will be

[Drawn from photographs.}
tests between pugilists of all sizes and !
weights.
Tic" ts have been selling so rapidly that |
Director Short is of the opinion that the
sale will have to be closed early this even
ing, as only those who can be accommo- |
dated with seats will be permitted to en- |
ter within the build in l-. Seats will not be I
reserved for any person, and as a conse
quence those first in will be first served.
The performance will commence promptly
at 8 o'clock with an eight-round contest
between Rochette and Butler.
Superintendent Kennedy and some of
the directors, with a physician, visited the
pugilists at their respective training quar
ters yesterday, and found them in splen
did condition. Davis has trained with a
view of winning this fight ; he has stated
positively that it will be his last. He is in
straitened circumstances, and realizes that
defeat will mean to him hard walking be
tween this City and Omaha.
Van Buskirk, his opponent, is so confi
dent of winning that he has been gambling
on himself. He thinks that a good blow
on the neck will send Davis to the happy
dreaming grounds, and as the Omaha man
is easily stunned from a jaw or neck blow.
Van Buskirk will enter the ring confident
of packing away the long end of the purse. !
If he proves successful he will be offend
good inducements to meet Jeffries, the
big Los Angeles pugilist, in a ten-round
bout.
Referee Corbett, who will be seated on
the outsile of the ring, says that he will
instruct the contestants before they enter
into a fistic argument that when he orders
them to break away they must do so im
mediately, and that the fighter who will
persist in holding on will be ordered out of
the ring and the fight declared against
him.
Corbett says further that as the contests
will be under Queensberry rules a pugilist {
can hold an opponent with one hand and |
hit with the other. This rule is not satis- I
factory to the directors of the club and in
all probability they will instruct Corbett
and the boxers this evening that clinch
ing of any description will net be tolerated
and that the contestants must "break"
when so oidered by the referee, or other
wise leave the ring.
Corbett has no favorites among the \
pugilists who are slated to appear inside
the rubber-roped square and according to
his own words, the contestants who will
put up the best fight will be awarded a
favorable decision.
McArthur and Green will certainly show
up well. This will be McArthur's first ap
pearance as a professional pugilist and his
many friends are anxious to see hew he
will acquit himself in front of the sturdy
young fellow whom Champion Corbett
predicted a few years ago would be a
champion of the class he represents.
Rochette and Butler will not dally on
the wayside as they are representatives of
a fraternity of fighters who believe in !
rushing things and getting through with |
their work us early as possible. Mahoney I
and Smith are so exceedingly clever that
it would not be safe for any judge of fight
ers to venture a prediction as to which of
the bantams will take the long end of the
creen. Smith is stronger than Mahoney
and having an advantage in being several
years younger than his opponent the bet
ting in the poolrooms favors the ex-ama
teur champion bantam.
Among the large gathering that will
witness the contests will be officers of the
army and navy and many prominent citi
zens who have already purchased tickets
for the entertainment.
CHECKING THE BOOKS.
The Acts of Ex-Superintendent Weaver
of the Alnishcuse Still Under*
i ;â  Investigation.
Though P. L. Weaver has not occupied
the position . of Superintendent of , the
Almshouse for some time, having been
removed by the Board of Health after a
long investigation, his acts while in power
are still under scrutiny, and for some time
past Superintendent Reddy and members
of the board have been engaged in check
ing up the books of the institution. "
This action - was * the outgrowth -of â¢ a
rumor that reached the board that just
prior to bis removal Mr. Weaver sold a
large amount of : junk that bad accumu
lated about the place and failed to turn in
the money received from the sale. â 
A junk-dealer at Twelth and Mission :
streets, who > had bought an old boiler for
$5 and a quantity of scrapiron and other
old metal for $18 more was unearthed, and
his books record the fact that he had pur
chased the stuff from the Almshouse.
It was said that other materials bad been
sold to various other dealers, but thus far
this statement has not been verified.
The amounts the junk man claims fo
have paid for t. c refuse metal have not yet
been lound entereit in the books, and the
ex-Superintendent will be asked to pro
duce some record or proof that he turned
the money over to the proper authority.
Jailed for Contempt.
R. P. Merillion, whom Judge Hebbard a few
days ago fined $100 and sentenced to two days
in jail for contempt of court, yesterday paid his
fine, having completed the service of the term
of imprisonment.
OUT FOR SOUND MONEY
Railroad Men Urged to Combine
in the Interests oi Commer
cial Prosperity.
Mine-Owners Said to Be at the Bottom
of the " Silyer M?dness " Rising in
the West and South.
Sound-money clubs are beine organized
among the railroad men <tt ti,is City. They
will be part of a central organization,
which will have branches in every town
where there are a sufficient number of
railroad men to form an auxiliary body.
The work of organization is now going
on simultaneously all over the United
States in response to the following appeal
sent to every railroad employe in the
country:
You have before you an opportunity such as
has rarely been given to any class of men in
historyâ the opportunity to be the controlling
influence in saving your country.
There is no State in the Union In which, if
you vote as a unit, you cannot turn the scale
in any ordinary election. In the present crisis
it resU with you to oppose a solid frontâ a bul
wark of reason and of patriotismâ to the flood
of free-silver madness which is rising in tne
Western and Southern States.
What interest have you in helping thoso
who, blinded and led astray as they are. pro
pose to raid tne treasury and bankrupt the
Nation only to make our mine-owners wealthy? !
Certain classes may not care what wreck
may come to the country's commerce if only
they can get cheap dollars for their crops.
The miner may be willing to see the United
btatessink to the rank of a third-class power,
bankrupt and dishonored, if only the output
of his mines be doubled in value uFhim.
But what is this to you? Your interests are
Dound up with the permanence of our com
mercial wosperity. For your honest work you
wantâ and have a right to getâ your pay in
honest dollars. What will you profit by a de
pression in wages and an increase in all that
your wages hav.e to buy ? Do you want to gei
your pay in dollars worth 50 cents apiece?
Therefore, organize! This Is no question of
Republican or Democrat, but of your own pro
tection as wage-earners. Orcanlze "for the
preservation of sound moneyâ in defense of
your own wagesâ in support of the country's
prosperity and the country's honor!
At every yhop and every division point on
every railway in the country there must bo a
Railway Men's Sound Money Club. If you,
who read this, are personally willing to take
hold of the work of organization in your local- !
ny and the work of educating your fellows for
ihelr and your own benefit, write to the Kail
way Age, Chicago. Until the central organiza
tion oft he Railway Men's Sound Money Clubs
is perfected, we will send you all the informa

LOOKS BAD FOR
PRIVATE KELLY,
His Preliminary Examina
tion for Murder Con
tinued.
DAMAGING TESTIMONY.
Several Witnesses Saw the
Defendant With a Razor
in His Hand.
SOME TELLTALE BLOODSTAINS
The Hearing Will Be Resumed This
Morning When C pain Vojdes
Will Be Examined.
The preliminary examination of Private
James Kelly of Battery E, Fifth Artillery,
charged with the murder of Private
Joseph E. Quinn at Fort Mason on Friday
night, July 10, was continued before
Judge Conlan yesterday afternoon.
Prosecuting Attorney Mogan conducted
the prosecution, and R. Porter Ashe and
Attorney Runcil, an ex-army officer, ap
peared for the defendant.
Private Harry Mills testified that he
was in company with both Kelly and
Quinn on the night of the murder. About
8 o'clock he had a tussle with Quinn on
the parade-ground. Several others were
there, but he did not know if Kelly was
one of them.
"I then went toward the canteen," con
tinued Mills, "and Quinn followed me and
wanted me to fight him. I declined and
went into the canteen. About a quarter
to 11 o'clock a lot of us were in the can
teen, Coleman, Sullivan, Quinn, Kelly,
Kampschmidt, Whalen and others.
Quinn was still in a fighting humor and
wanted to fight me some rounds for the
benefit of the canteen. I told him that I
would not fight within the fort, but if he
had some money to put up I would meet
him downtown.
"The canteen sergeant began putting
out the lights and we all left. I was the
first to leave and Quinn was alongside of
me. When we got about hhlf way between
the canteen and the squa<lroora Quinn
struck me on the chin.Jknocking me down,
and I remembered no more. When I
came to my senses I made for the guard
bouse to get protection, as I was afraid of
Quinn.
"I saw Kelly that night with a razor in
his hand. It had a dark handle. We
were in the canteen at the time, and Kelly
said that if any one followed him up and
bulldozed him he would be apt to use the
razor."
In cross-examination Mills said: "What
started the row between Quinn and myself
was this. We were playing craps and I
had won about $2 50. Quinn got angry at
losing and refused to give me $1 I had
won. When he struck me on the chin
and knocked me down he must have had
something in his hand."
Dr. (i. M. Wells, the post surgeon, was
an interesting witness. He had written
everything down to the minutest detail,
and he gave his evidence in the same
methodical manner.
"I first saw Kelly," said the doctor, "be
tween 11 and 11:30 in his bunk on the
night of the murder. The commanding
officer was with me. Kelly opened his
eyes, looked up at me, turned on his left
side toward the wall, shrugged his shoul
der, and pulled the cover over him. Noth
ing was said to him at that time. We saw
him later in the same bunk. We searched
the bedding for weapons, but found none.
I saw, however, bloodstains on both of
; Kelly's hands; one stain between the fin
i gers was about two inches long. I asked
him how the stains came there and he
said he did not know.
"The commanding officer then ordered
Kelly to be placed in confinement and he
suddenly changed his appearance and
acted as if he were stupid from drink."
The doctor then described the natu.p of
Quinn's wound and how he picked up the
razor, which he identified from blood
stains on both sides of the blade and on
the handle and from other marks. He
also identified Kelly's nat and cap, both
of which were stained with blood.
In cross-examination the doctor ad
mitted that none of the other occupants
of the bunks were examined, but a soldier
was examined in the guardhouse.
Corporal James Collins testified to see
ing Kelly in his bunk when Dr. Wells was
examining his hands. He saw the blood
stains and heard Kelly say he did not
know how they got there. Collins iden
tified the razor an one he had given Kelly
about a year ago in exchange for another. |
In cross-examination he said he would â 
not swear positively it was the razor, as \
he had made no marks upon it, but he was |
morally certain it was the same.
Sergeant Winfield Smith, who was in;
charge of the canteen, testified to seeing
Kolly in the canteen with a razor in his
hand talking to Mills, but he could not
identify the razor.
Private E. F. Merriman was in his bunk
and about 10 minutes to 11 he heard
a row outside. He jumped out of bed ana '
went on the porch. Just then Kelly '
came running np the steps without his
hat or coat and went into the sqnadroom. '<
"I went over," continued Merriman, I
"and saw Quinn iyingnear the lamp post. !
Wheeler was beside him and O'Donnell j
was holding his head. I beard Quinn say
that his jugular had been cat and he was a
goner. I ran to the guardhouse and noti
fied the officer that a fellow had been cut.
Then I went and put on my clothes and I
hurried to Dr. Wells."
Private Michael J. Coleman testified that
about a fraction of a minute after Quinn
was cut he saw Keily hurrying toward
the squad room. Privates Cornelius Sul
livan and Henry Kampschraidt gave un
important testimony and the hearing was
continued till this morning when Captain
Vogdes and two or three ottier witnesses I
will be examined.
It is understood that the defense will re
serve its testimony till the trial in the
Superior Court.
The Tribble Investigation Postponed. !
More testimony was heard yesterday in the
case of Captain Tribble, who is on trial before
the United States Inspector of Hulls and Boil
ers charged with negligence in handling the
ferry-boat San Rafael. On the Issue depends
Captain Tribble's license as a pilot. The de
fense produced a number of witnesses who
were of the opinion that the San Rafael kept a
straight course, and thought the captaiu of
the TiDuron ti blame for the narrowly averted
accident. No witnesses for the prosecution
were on hand, but Captain White of the Ti
buron promised to have a number on hand
next Monday, If the case was continued until
that time. Supervising Inspector Bermingham
then postponed further hearing until the day
named.
SPECIAL TAXPAYERS.
The Thirty Days' Once Allowed by
Collector Welburn Expires To-
Dayâ Many Delinquents.
The special taxpayers who have not vis
ited the office of the Internal Revenue
Collector during the oast thirty days will
find the doors closed to them after 3 o'clock
this afternoon. This means a fine of 50
per cent on the tax imposed.
There are 11,000 special taxpayers in Col
lector Welburn's district. Up to yester
day noon there still remained 1100 de
linquents, and it is not probable that more
than half that number will settle before
the conclusion of to-day's business. The
tax is really due July 1, but Collector
Welburn generally gives thirty days'
grace.
Chief Deputy Loupe says that, beginning
next Monday, special deputies will make
a house-to-house cauvass. There are al
ways a few, he says, who are willing to
risk a fine of 50 per cent, in the hope that
they can beat the Government out of ti e
principal. The number who â¢ultimately
escape, however, are very few.
SINGLE-TAX ERS ACTIVE.

Local Singie-taxers ' are arranging for a
series of "Delaware" meetings to be held
in various parts of the State. To-mor
row evening a meeting will be held in
Oakland at Hamilton Hall, at which Con
gressman Maguire, Ralph E. Hoyt and
others will speak. . A similar meeting will

FRED GARCIA'S TROUBLES
He Is Arrested in Contra Costa
County on a Bench
Warrant.
His First Wife Determined to Make
Him Support Her and Her
Five Children.
Fred Garcia, ex-depaty marshal of Sau
salito, was locked up in the City Prison
yesterday on a bench warrant issned by
Judge Campbell some time ago.
Garcia's matrimonial ventures have al
ready been published. Three or four years
ano Garcia eloped with the daughter of a
neighboring rancher in the northern part
of the State, deserting his wife and five
children. The deserted wife struggled
along for some time and then came to the
City with her children and worked hard
to support them.
She did not learn till last May of her
husband's whereabouts. She went to
Sausalito and found that he had married
the girl he had eloped with. She told him
she did not want to prosecute nim for
bigamy, but insisted that he should con- I
tribute $20 per month for the support of
his family. Garcia refused and she placed
the case in the "hands of the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.
He was arrested on the charge of cruelty
to children and was released on his own
recognizance on his promise that be
would pay his wife the $20 per month. He
paid the first installment and then dis
appeared.
A few days aeo a friend of Mrs. Garcia
notified her that her husband was living
with bis second wife at Lafayette, Contra
Costa County. She consulted the officers
of the society and the result was Judge
Campbell issued the bencn warrant for
Garcia's arrest.
Constable Thompson of Lafayette ar
rested him on Wednesday and yesterday
morning he was locked up in the City
Prison. The second Mrs. Garcia, with her
child, arrived in the City yesterday morn
ing and visited him in prison. She de
clared her intention of standing by him.
Garcia declined to discuss his troubles, |
but hinted that they would be of short
duration. _^______________
OUTSIDE IMPROVEMENTS
General Activity Noticeable in
Western and Southern
Sections.
Ridley Street Has Been Cut
Through Market-Street
Hill
-Outside of the commercial center of San
Francisco there is what may be termed a
revival in the line of steady improvements.
Several new dwellings have been erected
and others are about; to be erected in the
near future. . Besides those the street work
is going ahead in a quiet and steady man
ner, with a push that means that prop
erty-owners have not lost hope in the fu

has been let to A. B. Clute, and this work I
will be commenced at once and pushed to j
a finish. From an 'unsightly, uneven,

the wagon.
; The next movement to be made on this ;
line will be to have the street" lighted by '
electricity. * |
The executive committee of the Mission

"WELL, GOOD-BY, BOYS."
With This Parting Salute William
Wyman Sends a Ballet Through
His Brain.
William H. Wyman, a collector for the
Bell Telephone Company, . committed
suicide' yesterday afternoon by sending a
bullet through his brain. He had been
drinking heavily of late, but so far as
known was not pecuniarily embarrassed.
About 2 o'clock Wyman walked into the
grocery-store of J. H. C. Baden, Fell and
Devisadero streets, and after passing a
few pleasant words with the proprietor
and one or two others present passed into
a rear room. After a moment or so ha
came back to the door saying, "Well, good
h y. boys." A second later the fatal shot
was fired, followed by a heavy fall. When
Baden and bis companions reached the
room Wyman was dead.
The suicide was a brother-in-law of At
torney George A. Knight. Up to twelve
months ago he was a reporter on one of
the daily papers of this City, but since
then has served the telephone company
in the capacity of a collector. He was
well known about town and was generally
liked. Wyman's body was removed to
the Morgue, where an iuquest will be helil
to-day.
I"o thÂ« Asylum.
Judge Hebbard yesterday committed Adolph
Etseuschimel to the Ukiah asylum. The
prisoner is possessed of a suicidal mauia and is
afraid of being seen.

The Power
of Manhood.
WHEN YOU LOSE THAT
power you have lost all
the best , of life. T;iere is a
charm gone from your exist-
ence, and you miss it more than
anything else.' -^^ â 
But when you regain it after
years of incapacity your heart
will leap with joy â then the
bright spirit will shine forth in
your eye, and the happy smile
in your countenance will tell
your acquaintances that you
have found a new existence.
Then you meet your friends
with the strong clasp of the
hand and the look of confidence
which tell them that "here is
the new-born man."
: Your every action bespeaks
new manhood. You are then a
i better man physically and men-
tally -. than if you had never,
known weakness.
â  "You can say that I was
nearly a wreck in every way,
but I am now a better man than
I ever thought of being," says
L. L. Jaccard, the Jeweler, of
j San Leandro, Cal., after using
Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt.
Some men feel that they are
not weak, though they are : not
what they might be in manlyi
vigor had they not lightly trans-
gressed the laws of Nature.
These are just the ones who
most appreciate the value of Dr.
Sanden's Belt. In a few weeks
they learn that it can make them
twice as strong as they were.
'"Before I began using your
Belt I thought there was not
much the matter with me, but
'â after using it a month I have
found the value of good health,
I says Wm. Simpson, Goleta, Cal.'
Electricity is wonderful in its
etrengthening influence. Your
vitality seems to grow stronger
and more buoyant every day.
There seems no limit to your
Oergies. You can do twice the
amount of work you formerly]
could, and not get weary.
"I can do as much work as
any two men now," says L,
C. Minzard, Napa, Cal.
Words cannot tell of the
gratitude felt by the men
who have been restored to man-
hood by Dr. , Sanden's Electrio
Belt. Will.you become: one ot
its happy patients ? You can
learn how great has been, its
good work by reading the little
book, "Three Classes of : Men,"
which Dr. Sanden will send you
free, closely sealed, on request.

OUT FOR FUSION,
The Democratic State Leader
Will Wire Jones About
It To-Day.
WOULD DIVIDE ELECTORS
Mr. Alford Returns to Halt in
Naming the Advisory
Committee.
DETJPREY MAY BE CHAIKMAN.
The State Campaign Will Open as
Soon as That Vice-Presidential
Mess Is Settled.
W, H. Aiford, chairman of the Demo
cratic State Central Committee, returned
to the city yesterday from his home in Vi
salia prepared to remain during the cam
paign, and to start the Democratic State
machine.
He brought along tne roll of the advis
ory committee as the State campaign com
mittee is termed, but he did not make
public his appointments. The list as he I
had made it out with much meditation at
home, he showed to a few leading Demo
crats with tbe unavoidable result that he
became perplexed.
It is no floral carnival for any State
chairman when he has such a committee
to appoint and Mr. Alford will to-day suf
fer a continuation of the palls and good
advice which began yesterday. Gavin Mc-
Nab's political wisdom is especially at Mr.
Alford's disposal as is that of other Junta
leaders.
Gavin McXab is generally expected to
be the busiest and most influential boss
around the State machine during this
campaign, and he will endeavor to see
that improper persons are not given recog
nition, the improper perwns being any
body opposed to the local rule of the
Junta. Mr. McNab has the advantage of
being the author of Mr. Alford'a political
position as the State leader of the party.
It was AJcNab who "thought up" Mr.
Alford fbr the chairmanship, surprised
that gentleman with an offer of the place,
and then accomplished the easy job of
getting him elected. Hence McNab is
expected to receive consideration.
Chairman Alford was given power to
name a committee of any size be pleased
and to go outside of tbe State Central
Committee for some of his appointees.
He said last night that tbe committee
would number twenty-five and that about
fifteen would be members of the State
Central Committe.
"I will probably be ready to-morrow
night to annoance the advisory, legisla
tive and literary committees." said Mr.
Alford last night at the California, where
he stays. "I will probably appoint the
secretary a day or two later."
It was rumored last night that Eugene
N. Deuprey will b? named at chairman of
the advisory committee, and that there
will not be a gold man or a Huckleyite on
the list. The State headquarters in the
California Hotel are now open daily.
Chairman Alford is hot for fusion with
the Populists, and is willing to trade off
almost anything for a chance that the
Democrats may win something here and
there. He is going to telegraph to-day to
National Chairman Jones for advice and
for tips on how the Sewall-Wataon com
plication is likely to come out.
"I think that an arrangement with the
Station F, Which Will Be Built on the Northeast Corner of Fillmore and Sacra
mento Streets.
[From a drawing by W. W. Rednall, architect and builder.]
Populists can be effected, if it is necessary
to effect it," said Mr. Alford. "I will
telegraph to Senator Jones, our National
chairman, to-morrow and find if he hRs
any plan.
"I think that it is desirable that the
party nationally move in harmony. I
have talked with many Populists in tbe
Ban Joaquin Valley and they are very
willing to nave the matter harmonized on
reasonable terms. There seems to be a
universal demand among them that Mr.
Watson shall stay on tbe ticket.
'â¢If for any reason it should transpire
that the National committees of both
parties are unable to effect a satisfactory
compromise I shall be in favor of effecting
one in California anyway, and I have no
doubt that it can be done. In that event,
and if both Sewall and "Watson remain on
the tickets, I suppose the only basis
would be a division of the electors in pro
portion to tbe party vote at the last elec
tion. No, I think there would be little
trouble in inducing the nominees on both
tickets to resign.
"There Has been some talk of fusion in
some districts on Congressional and legis
lative candidates, and I think such
arrangements are not impossible iv some
places.
"We are going to make an aggressive
campaign, and it will be begun as soon as
t^he Vice-Presidential matter is nettled.
We will make silver the only campaign
issue, and the issue of protection will be
largely ignored."
M'KINLEY BKNYAKAR.
An EnthuÂ«la*Ue Republican Celebrates
an Important Kvent.
Isaac Benyakar, Mason, Mystic Shriner
and dealer in Egyptian gooils, is a very
proud man to-day. Last night his good
wife presented him with a bouncing boy.
Not that there is anything strange in this
lact, but he has maae it known to all that
be is a good Republican, and, notwith
standing the custom of his country, which
would name his son Benyakar Ben Isaac,
the infant wiil be known to posterity by
the happily combined and euphonious
names of McKinley Benyakar.
It was many months ago that Mr.
Benyakar Sr. so decided. His first born,
however, was a disappointment. It turned
out to be a girl. But Mr. Benyakar was
equal to the occasion. He was visiting
here at the time, and owned a concession
at the Midwinter Fair. Why not call tbe
youngster California? And California
Benyakar it was.
Then Mr. Benyakar bethought him of
becoming a citizen of tbe United States.
He conceived a violent admiration for the
Republican nominee for President. He
wrote to Major McKinley, receiving a
gracious response, and to-day Master Mc-
Kinley Benyakar is the recipient of that
honored name.
Dr. de Witt was the medical gentleman
who was the first to offer his congratula
tions. Closely following him was C. L. J.
W. Pierce, member of the State Central
Committee of the Forty-ninth Assembly
District of Alameda. Mr. Benyakar senior
celebrated the event by taking out his
second and final citizen's papers.
MORE MAIL FACILITIES.
The New Streetcar System
Will Be Inaugurated on
August 15.
A Handsome Office Will Be Built
on the Corner of Filimore and Sac
remento Streets.
Inspector-in-Charge Mnnro was form
ally notified Wednesday by tbe department
at Washington that the plans for tho new
Postoltice station on Sacramento and Fill
more streets, as designed by Architect
Kednall, were acceptable, the local build
ers being authorized to commence work at
once.
This means, presuming the contractors
who are building the new station at the
foot of Market street fulfill their prom
ises, that the proposed street railway mail
service will be in operation by August 15.
This will give ban Fiancisco'tbe best mail
service it has ever had, the system em
ployed being equal to any in the country.
The three mailcars which Mr. Vining
agreed to furnish have been completed,
and could be pressed into service at a
moment's notice. One car is fit;ed for the
electric roads, and will of itseli be abie to
reach nearly every branch office in the
City. A second car has been built for the
[ broad-gauge cable lines, while the tnird is
I intended to take in the Sacramento and
j Clay streets system.
In order to perfect the street-railway
mail system Postmaster McCoppin found
it necessary to change stations A and F. t
The tirst has been removed from Polk and
Sutter streets to Poik and Sacramento.
The second (F) will be changed from Post j
and Devisadero to Sacramento and Fili
more. The removal in this instance was
deemed advisable because of a desira to
have ail the stations on cross-town lines.
The Devisadero electric line stops at
Sacramento street. As now arranged it is
possible for station F to reach any portion i
of the City on an electric road. Station F j
will be a handsome two-story frame struc- j
ture with interior finishings complete in
every detail.
Incidentally it may be remarked that
befora the new system goes into effect !
every branch office in the City will be
overhauled. Inspector Thrall has charge
of this work, and be proposes to have
every convenience and contrivance which
will in any way facilitate tbe rapid transit
of mail. In the meantime he is also look
ing out for the comfort of the people who
patronize the branch offices.
Kveninjc Drawing Clasnes.
The San Francisco Art Association will inau
gurate evening ciasses of drawing from the
antique and life at the opening of the August
term of the school year. These classes will be
established for the benefit of all those follow

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JULY 31, 1896.
MAKES HIS HOME
IN THE WATER.
George Cavill Claims the
Championship of the
World.
SWIMS ALL DISTANCES.
Saved Lives From the Deep
When He Was Only Eleven
Years Old.
ALL COMERS ARE WELCOMED.
Cavill Is the Son of the Lrng.Dis.
tance Championship Swimmer
of the World.
The champion long-distance swimmer
of Australasia arrived on the steamer Mo
nowai yesterday, tie is a phenomenon in
the water, and during his career has saved
twenty -one lives.
George Cavill is the name of the young
George CavilL the Champion Swimmer of Australasia, Who Is Anxious to Try
Conclusions With the lust Swimmers in America.
: man, and when he was only 11 years old
be made his first rescue. It was in Botany
| Bay, and one of bis schoolmates had got
! beyond the breakers. It is a shelving
; beach, and one of the most treacherous
jon the coast of New South Wales. The
! child h&d no fear, however, and without a
] moment's hesitation sprang into the surf
and brought his schoolmate to lana
with the aid of a life-line thrown from the
shore.
Time and again young Cavill risked his
life to gave others, and his breast
is covered with medals, among which is
that of the Royal Humane Society.
He is thn son of Professor Caviil, cham
pion iong-distancn swimmer of the world.
"In a ten-mile race my father can beat
me, even now," said young Cavill on the
Monowai yesterday. "In a sprint I always
.have the best of it, but when it comes to a
question of swimming a long distance I
am not in it with my father. Judging,
however, from what I saw of the point as
we came in, I think it would be an easy
job to swim from a quiet spot in the
harbor around tbe point and tbe seal
rocks and land on tbe ocean beach. Ol
course, I don't know the tides and cur
rents, and if I attempted the swim some
I one in a boat would have to accompany
me."
Young Cavill is an athlete. He is al
ways in trainine, and when the Monowai
was in Apia and Honolulu he rivaled tbe
natives in their feats of diving and stay
ing under water.
Some years ago a steamer bound from
Melbourne for Sydney went ashore neur
Coogee, N. S. W. The waves were break
ing heavily, and no one could get within
hailing distance of the vessel. It was then
that young Cavill earned his spurs, fie
swam out through the breakers and took
a leading line with him. A hawser was
hauled ashore, and everybody aboard was
saved by means of the breeches buoy.
Cavill it built like an athlete but is as

MR. WHITNEY'S TROUBLE
Pursued by a Man Who He Says Wants
v to Steal His Wife From
Him.
Mrs. Annie L. Whitney has sued her
husband, Abbot L. vVhitney, a prominent
insurance agent, for divorce, allegiug ex
treme cruelty.
Mr. Whitney has been extremely unfor
tunate, if all that is said of him be true.
He has been married twice. His first wife
is said to have deserted him aud eloped
with a man named Blackwell, who was a
steward on a China steamer. At any rate,
Mr. Whitney got a divorce from Mrs.
Whitney on such grounds.
Two years ago, however, Mr. Whitney
married again, and recently he has seen
Blackwell, who, be says, has deserted his
parumour, hanging about his house on
Leavenworth street. The idea seized the
insurance man that the gay sailor wished
to deprive him of his second wife. He ac
cused Mrs. Whitney of encouraging Black
well's attentions, and finally, so it is said,
assaulted her during a fit of jealous rage.
Sbe thereupon promptly applied for a
divorce. It she gets it, Mr. Whitney will
probably wait until Blackwell dies before
he marries again.

EASTWOOD'S VINDICATION
He Lays the Blame on the
Wretchedly Paved Streets
and Roads.
The Dairyman Tells a Harrowing
Ta'.e of a Young Horse Dis
abled for Life.
Herbert Eastwood, the Ocean View
dairyman accused of starving and ill
treating his horses, has sent the following
communication to the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which
has been for some days past investigating
the charges against him;
Gentlemen: Yesterday, July 28, your society
sent out to my place one of your officers to in
quire into tiie condition of ivy two horses
pursuant to complaints forwarded to your
office. lam a poor man, 60 years old, having
astrff right shoulder and a bruised hip from
being thrown off my waeon three or four times
on account of the badly paved roads and
streets. Through these shameful streets of
San Francisco 1 must daily drive my horses in
order to (mm the pittance which is my only
means of livelihood. I have no lame or starved
hortes, but 1 have seen many so lame that they
can hardly move and far poorer in flesh than
ruine.
Now I wish to complain about the condition
of the streets of the City. Several of mv horse*
have been cut by stumbling, sprained "by slip
ping and wounded by falling. My last acci
dent was on Main street, near the Sailors'
Home and by reason of it a young horse was
entirely ruined. I had to bandage his knees
with rope and sacking and get to my home
without him. When his wounds were entirely
healt- d 1 sold him to a chicken ranch for Â«1 50
But the hilis aud dales, ruts and chuckholes
which spoiled my colt are there yet Ii is rot
such men as I that are to blame for the lame
and used-up hordes that we Â»cc going around.
Mr. Eastwood then goes on to mention
in detail some localities where walking
ana driving are most unsafe, and con
cludes by saying:
I speak as one having a right to speak, since
1 pay my share of the taxes. It is a shameful
piece of cruelty to oblige dumb animals to
travel over many of the streets of this opulent
City of San Francisco. F

TAILOR BUCHMAN
WAS NEAR ARREST,
Refused to Answer Deputy-
Labor Commissioner's
Questions.
ABOUT THE SWEATSHOPS
His Female Help Skipped Out
the Door When Green
Appeared.
YESTERDAY'S INVESTIGATION.
The Average Wages Found to Bs
Paidâ Some Very Dirty
Tailor Shops
The real "sweatshop," as it exists in
the East in general and New York in par
ticular, over which 20,000 tailors are now
out on a strike, does not exist in San
Francisco. There is no little foul-smell
ing room in which people eat, sleep, work
and eke out a miserable existence on a
pittance of pay month in and month out.
That is the real Eastern "sweatshop."
But there are dirty, dingy, malodorous
tailor-shops in this City where small
enough wages are paid. There is a sort of
a sweat system in prices in which the
proprietors of some tailor-shops make
the proprietors of other tailor-shops per
spire over the small figure at which they
must lake work. "That is the real abuse
in San Francisco, together with the fail
ure of the tailors themselves to unite and
stick together so far as long hours and
small wages and child labor in tailor
shops are concerned," said a tailor yester
day.
Deputy Labor Commissioner E. ML
Greene continued yesterday the investiga
tion instituted tne day before by Commis
sioner Fitzgerald on complaint of a com
mittee of the Garment- workers' Union.
This committee furnished the Labor Com
missioner a list of "sweatshops," and
promised to send a man or two around
yesterday to show where the places were
located. Nobody appeared for this duty,
bnt Di puty Greene started out anyhow.
Eight places were visited. The worst
shops are located south of Market. The
worst for ventilation and general ram
shackleness was tbe shop of K. Baago at
246 Jessie street. He employs eight
women and girls, one man and a boy, and
the proprietor himself was sweating at
hard labor over a pressing-board when the
Deputy Commissioner arrived.
The finishers in this shop can make
about $7 80, if they work a full week, but
they usually earn about |5, as business is
dull. The boy gets $1 75. He runs
errands. The operator on a machine that
is run by electric power cets $1 75 a day.
She said that she got that much, but Mr.
Baago said she was paid $2. The floor of
this room sagged; the ceiling was low and
threatening, the light comparatively poor,
all of which was reached by a stairway
that would take first prize in a contest be
tween dilapidated stairways. But the
snop was no dirtier than the average tailor
shop.
About the average wages paid among
the shops visited yesterday for appren
tices is $2 50 per week; for finishers, from
$6 to $9; for machine operators, $12 to $14;
pressers, $5 to $S. In piece-work shops a
competent girl can make almost as much
when there is plenty of work to do. But
now there is not plenty of work, and the
amount of wages must be scaled down
from 25 to 50 per cent.
The publication of the visits made
to the shops the day before. In which
the worst showing was made, evidently
had a precautionary effect on several shops
that were visited yesterday.
At a shop on Howard street there were
no girls at work. The only persons on the
premises were the proprietors. The pro
prietors of many of the shops objected to
tbe girls being questioned as to the
amount of wages received, number of
hours they worked, etc.
At the shop of M. Buchman, 291 Everett
street, near Fourth, there was a general
exodus of employes when the Deputy
Labor Commissioner and a Call reporter
entered. The six or seven girls sat for a
moment or two until they got an inklir.g
as to who the visitor* were; then they all
threw aside the ; .r sewing and made a dash
for the door. There was a clattering of
chairs, a scurrying of feet, a giggle and a
little scream or two, and the six or seven
flying skirts were out of sight. These
were robust girls.
Proprietor Buchman is a Pole. He
hardly noticed the stampede. In fact, he
appeared to have expected it and pre
arranged it. The explanation he gave was
that the girls went out feariug to get their
pictures in the newspapers.
Then he made matters worse, particu
larly for himself, by refusing to answer
the questions of Deputy Greene.
The deputy forthwith ordered him toar
pear at the Commissioner's office inside
of two hours to answer questions or he
would arrest him, and he made out a for
mal subpena.
The system of forcing reductions of
prices by shop proprietors, in use by seve
ral well-known tailors, is thus described by
Deputy Greene:

Union have told me that these well-known
tailors have a regular hour set at which
tailors who employ these girls must come
to get tbe cloth to sew. They will then
hold uj>, for instance, a bundle of trousers,
telling how many are in "the bundle, and
a<k for bids. These men are thus placed
in competition with each other, and the
lowest bid gets it. These men look out
for themselves, and the result is that
these employes must bear their proportion
in their wages of the lowness of the bid.
One of the auctioneers of work deducts 10
per cent from the pay of the successful
binder for the privilege of working for him.
and another has the reputation of paying
the lowest price and being the meanest
man in tbe business to work for. He will
pay on!y 60 cents, for instance, for mak
ing vests."
FIXED FOR TRIAL.
The Fair Will Caie to . Come Up for
- Hearing in Court Next .
Monday.
Stephen Roberts concluded the reading
of his deposition in the matter of the Fair
will in Pierson & Mitchell's office yester
day morning and affixed his signature.
Miss Margaret Craven called for tbe
type-written transcript of her testimony,
ana w?s allowed to take ii home where sue
will peruse it at her leisure.
The trial of the original case brought by
Charles M. Fair to break the trust in the
will of the 24th, is set for next Monday
morning before Judge Slack. If nothing
interferes the great battle will be begun",
and most of the points in the contest will
be met and fought out.
Another Railroad Suit.
Osmond G. Neilsen has sued the Market
â treet Railway Company for $ 10,550. Neilsen
is a milkman, and on July t> his wagon was
struck by a Howard-street car at the corner of
East street. Xeilsen's arm was broken, his
wagon smashed and one of his horses injured.
wherefore he wants to be awarded $10,550
damages. Carl F. Bjorn, who wns injured in
the same accident, has brought suit for $10,
-000 damages.
Wants His Allowance.
Samuel C. Meyer, a son of Charles Meyer,
who died March 14, 1893, hss caused a citation
to be issued to Chnrles L. Ackerman and Abra
ham Brown, acting executors of the will of
his father, commanding them to appear in
Judge Hebbard's court and explain why they
do not pay him $100 a montn, as provided in
the will. Itisclnimed that the iucome of the
estate is over $2000 a month, but that the
executors are $381 94 in arrears iv payments
to the plaintiff.

Explanation,
The avow files with the wind. The top figures
a' station indicate maximum temperature for the
rlays: :ho>f underneath it. if any, the amount of
m; tit All, of melted snow.in inches and hundredth*. ,
during Ihe past <welve hours. Isobars, or solid I
lints, connect, poln s of equal air pressure; ieu- i
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "high" means high barometric pressure and
is -usually accomDanied by fair weather: "low"
rifcra to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accoropnnled by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lo.vs" usually first appear on the Washington
cea-ft. When the pressure is high in the Interior
â  and . low a:ong the coast, and the isobars extend 1
north and south along the coast, rain Is probable;
b::t when the "low" is inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain couth of Dnfpm Is improb
able. With a "high" in Ihe vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather In winter. The reverse of these condition!
ill produce an opposite result.

CHICAGO, Iti., July Strength was im
parted to wheat this morning by the Cincinnati
Price Current summary which received a bullish
Interpretation. Likewise an advance of %d at
Liverpool was viewed with satisfaction by the
owners of wheat, but the pain in price proved
tempting to the bears and with promptness offer
ings became heavy, the natural consequence bring
a sharp declinr. Receipts were fair at 123 cats for
Chicago and 317 In the Northwest. The latter !
section had 216 lav Thursday and '.-01 a year aso. j
Local Inspections trom store were 12,500 bushels. i
'1 he ndlana report, estimating a yield of 24.-
OOO.UCO bushels, was used as an argument for
lower prices and was responsible for considerable
weakness Closing Paris iabeÂ» were 10(020 cen
times loner ior flour andlO@2S centimes lower
for wheat. Antwerp was unchanged to 12% cen
times higher. Berlin quoted i 14 ($2 marks advance.
Export clearances were fair ut -72.474, bushels.
September Wheat opened from 593 Â« to 59i/gc,
declined to r.S@5By 8 c closing at 58%a58VÂ»c %c
under yesterday. Estimated receipts" for to-mor
row, 135 cars.
CORNâ Opened barely steady, readily joining In
the declining course subsequently marked by
wheat. The proportions of the movement of this
grain grow daily, and it is confidently predicted by
receivers that next week will witness something
almost unprecedented in the volume of the re-,
i ceipts. . Liverpool quoted a slight recovery In price,
due to sympathy with yesterday's improvement
here. Receipts to-day were 902 cars, and 262,080
bushels were taken from store. The Cincinnati
Price Current reported continued good promise for
the crop. Export clearances amounted to 142,595
tushels. September corn opened at 24% c, de
clined ;o 24Vic closing at 24%@24%c, %c under
yesterday. Estimated receipts for to-morrow
1065 cars.
OATS- While declining slightly in response to
the weakness of the other markets were not gov
erned to any extent by the undertone of firmness
which has existed for some time past. Receipts
were 114 cars, and 259,062 bushels were taken I
from store. Export â  clearances amounted to
50,322 bushels. September oats closed VsdtVic

with reference to that of the hog market, which
was a little firmer. The close tor September pork

September ribs a shade higher.

Club.
AN AGGRESSIVE FIGHT.

Method of Choosing Olficers
for Primary.
MANY SILENT POLITICIANS.
Not Anxious to Commit Themselves
Till the Congressional Cat
Has Jumped.
Oakland Office Ban Fkawcisoo Call,)
908 Broadway, July 30. j
Not since the Seventh Ward has been a
strong Republican district has there been
such a wide split as exists at this time.
Tbe cause of the breach iÂ» the failure to
agree on a oandidate for Congress. The
Regular Seventh Ward Club is supposed to
be decidedly favorable to Hilborn, and it
was thought there would be but little op
position, and that not of an organized
character. But this calculation has been
entirely upset.
The Union League Club has Just been
organized and its growth is rapid. While
it has not declared itself openly on the
Congressional tight it is well known that
it ia favorable to Frick. Nearly 100 mem
bers sinned tbe roll, and in a few days it
wiil have twice that membership. Many
men who were the stroneest supporters of
Hilborn are in the new club. Robert
Leckie, ex-AsEessor, C. W. Wilkins, E.
.Nusnaumer, George Chase and William
ilcGrath are Union League men and each
one is an accomplished organizer.
President Dow of tbe Seventh Ward
Regular Club has called a meeting lor next
weeK, and both Congressional candidates
have been invited to be present.
The four men who have as much influ
ence in the Seventh Ward as anybody are
County Clerk Jordan, ex-Mayor Pardee,
Councilman Dow and Assemblyman
Dodge. Their positions on the predom
inating question of the hour it would be
bard to define. Dr. Paidee is certainly for
Hilborn; Dodge and Dow have not said
anything, and Frank Jordan is credited
with being in the Frick camp, though he
will not say so. Robert Leckie' s position
is not in doubt. He worked like a hero
for Hilborn at the last election, and now
he feels that Hilborn's friends have gone
back on him and he has jumped the
traces. Friends of Frick have already
held meetings at the houses of E. Nusbau
mer. R. Leckie and Charles Wilkins, bat
so far little has been heard of Hilborn's
campaign.
The situation in Alameda is notany less
interesting. Hilborn's speech at St. Louis
lavoring the anti-Denison delegates to
the National Convention was very much
against tbe position taken by E. K. Tay
lor, who controls the Republican machin
ery of the Encinal City, and it is expected
that Fries wili have an equal chance with
the delegates.
The County Committee has not yet
named the officers for the primaries and
neither is it decided how they shall be
elected. Chairman Mautalen has called a
meeting for next Saturday at which the
matter will be settled. The State Central
Committee advised that the County Com
mittee call the primary for August 16
and that the warring Congressional Com
mittees shall each name half of the elec
tion officers. Will Church, a County Com
nvtteeman and the leader of "the four"
Supervisors, says that the State Commit
tee merely made a recommendation re
garding the appointment of officers, and
is in favor of rejecting it and appointing
whom they please, irrespective of either
Congressional Committee. Such a high
handed proceeding is roundly condemned
by the friends of Frick. They say that
such a course would hurt him and that he
is too young a politician to advise or
countenance any such measure.
Every ward and township is interested
in the contest and all kinds of guesses are
beine made as to the result of the Con
gressional Convention, which will be held
at Vallejo on August 17.
A long letter has been sent to Mr. Hil
born by some prominent Republicans.
Tne concluding paragraph, winch is a
tummary of the whole, is as follows:
We, as Republicans, to the end that there
cau be no question as to where you stand, ask
you, will you if elected stand for and vote for
the financial policy adopted at St. Louis, which
is the policy to which our candidate lor Presi
dent and our party is committed? Or do yon
propose,, if elected, to ignore our financial pol
icy as outlined by our National Convention
and vote for the free and unlimited coinage of
fcilver, party or no party?
If you cannot give loyal support to tbe prin
ciples enunciated in the Republican platform,
have you any right to seek a nomination at
the hands cf that party? Is it not your mani
fest duty to withdraw and allow the Republi
cans to nominate some one who can and
will stand and if need be fall by the
principles, who can and will make his
Bucce-s depend upon the success of those
doctrines which McKinley represents, and
who will not be compelled to seek hie per
sonal advancement by the surrender of the
cause of Republicanism as announced in our
National platform? No excuse need be offered
for asking you for an answer to tnese questions.
They are political questions of the utmost

A Letter From tbe President of the
Woman's International Maybrick
Association.
Oakland Office Sas Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, July 30. f
A few weeks ago an article was pub
lished in the Oakland correspondence of
The Woman In WhÂ«.se Guilt or Innocence Half the World Is Interested.
From a picture forwarded to "The Call" from London by Dr. Helen Densmore, President
of the Woman's International Maybrick Association.]
The Call that quickly excited, mach in
terest in England. The article referred to
an association that was imposing on the
public by soliciting subscriptions for the
alleged purpose oi obtaining Mrs. May
br;ck'p release.
â¢ Dr. Helen Densmore, president of the
Women's International Maybnck Asso
ciation, read the article and states that it
possessed much interest for the associa
tion in two countries.
This morning the following letter was
received from Dr. Densmore:
bnMwom House, >
78 Elm Park Road. V
South Ksmnaian, London, July 15.)
Correspondent San Francisco Call, â  Oaklandâ
Dear Sir: I would like to reply as briefly as
possible to an article li.at appeared in The
Call of â¢ June 20 regarding the Maybrick case.
Quoting the words of Dr. O. L. Jones, you
Bay: '"So confident were the^public thnt a ver
dict of acquittal would be brought in that they
carried large white bouquets into couit ready
to present to her when me verdict should be
pronounce.l."
Allow me to remind you that this was a
confidence in which even the Judge himself
sharedâ bitterly prejudiced as he was against
the unfortunate womanâ for when the jury
retired at the close of his twelve hours'
harangue, calling the. clerk to him, he asked
what he supposed the verdict would be "My
lord," replied the clerk, "1 am not the jury
"Oh," said the Judge, "it is impossible for
them to find her guilty in face of the medical
evidence." This was also the opinion of the
prosecution; of the press, by whom it was so
firmly entertained that special editions of the
evening papers announcing a. verdict oi "not
guilty" were printed and sold in the streets of
Liverpool; and we are told by the Lord Chief
Justice of Englandâ then Sir Charles Russellâ
that the verdict came as a surprise upon the
trained minds of the bar of the Northern cir
cuit, and that to the very last moment (even
after the summing up) the leading counsel for
the prosecution, Mr. Addison, Q.0..M. P., per
sisted in saying that the jury could notâespe
cially in view of the medical evidenceâ a
verdict of "guilty."
Again you remark, using the words of Dr.
Jones, "1 he friends of Mrs. Maybrick have a
wrong conception of the facts. They a-e work
ing on the idea that Mr.-. Mavbrick was
thrown into prison and that the British Home
! Secretary, who is the active part of royalty m
such cases, is afraid to advise her pardon be
cause the popular, voice demands it." Now it
is because the popular voice does not demand
it, because the people of this countryâ not
being fully acquainted with the facts of the
caseâ have never yet demanded her release,
that the Women's International Mavbrick
Association was formed. Once let the popular
voice make.- Itself heard and even the Homo
Office must bow to its mandate, for in this
country, as in our own.it is the people Mho
hold the power and make and unmake Par
liaments and Premier?. Well might it be said
by Auberon Herbert, "The only conscience
English officialism knows Is public opinion
Once rouse that and English officialism will
soon net.
la the words of the manifesto issued by this
association at the time of its formationâ"The
Women s International Maybrick Association
has. determined to take this case to the peon.
of Englandâ to the only court open to â the
court of public opinion. Whatever may be
true of the Government the English people are
kind at heart, : justice-loving and believe in
fair play. When the facts oi this case are put
before them we confidently believe -hat Eng
land will sustain her reputation of I being pre
eminently a ju*>tice-lovinÂ« nation. We propose
to open a popular subscription of 1 shMini?
asking every woman in Great Britain and
America to give this amount. With- this
money wo proposo to begin a series of free lec
tures in tne principal cities and towns of
Grca. Britain. . We iirmly .believe that in this
Wtt ,?'^ til * P eo P ie become interested, and
will demand that the case be reviewed "
It is certainly unfortunate thatan unauthor
ized person should have collected funds for
this = association and have misappropriated
them, but the fact. that this woman washable
to raise so large a sum from i the kind-hearted
women of the States Is encouraeinjr.;- hi the
interests of Â»bo association when 1 returned to
America last year I conceived the idea of col
lecting the necssary. amount .' of ; money from
the Women's Federated Clubs, which number
about 500,000 members, 1 at â¢â¢ the f rate '- of -10
cents from each ? member,' which would have
given us a sufficient sum to liberate Mrs. Mav
brick on the lines .laid down In the mani
festo, and no one would - have been burdened.'
In this, however, I was grievously disappointed,
as I found it impossible to reach the women of
the States through these organizations, as the
rules do not permit of -co '.lections, or petitions
officially matte, and 1 was therefore compelled
reluctantly to abandon the idea.-. - : â¢ â¢
Quoting "the opinion of au Englishman liv
ing l,n San Francisco, you state that "Mrs.
Maybrick bad one of the iairest trials and per
haps the ablest criminal pleader In the world,
Sir Charles Russell, to defend her." Lord Rus
sell came to this trial from the long strain of
the Pigott-Tlmes trial, and was really unfit to
take the case, besides . bring badly Instructed
by the barrister for the defense. â  So that really
Mrs. Maybrick did not, have an able defense,
although Lord Russell has since done all In his
power to aid and benefit her.'
As regards the alleged fairness of the trial, it
may be well to hear the- opinion of another
Englishman, Mr. Stead, editor of the Review
of Reviews, who ".: writes: â¢â¢This American
woman was sentenced to be hanged by a Judge
on the verge of "dotage, rafter, the counsel for
the prosecution had remarked It was impos
sible to find a verdict oi guilty in the face of
the medical evidence.
"She was declared by the Jury to have been
clearly proved guilty of willfully poisoning a
man, whom the Home Secretary, sitting as
court of appeal, found was possibly not mnr
dered at all; and she is now serving a sentence
which was not pronounced by the Judge, for
an offense which was neither aliened against
her in -the indictment nor submitted to the
jury at the trial. No Englishman can feel
otherwise than ashamed of having to defend
the manner in which the hns , been dealt with
by our courts and our Government. We shall
not be able to escape ft gibbeting that is little
short of a national humiliation. â¢ A sorrier ex
hibition of nil that Is worst in the blundering,
wrong-headed, illogical side of John Bull has
seldom or never given occasion for his enemies
to exult and his friends to wince."
It is to be hoped that Congress, which has
taken this matter up for investigation, will
fine some way ot inducing the English Govern
ment, as an. act of international courtesy, to
release this long-suffering and unjustly ac
cused and imprisoned woman, who has already
endured seven years of the horrors of penal
servitude for a crime- that she never com
mitted.
Thanking you in advance, 1 am, very, truty
yours, Helen Dkssmore.
President of thfi Women's International May
brick Association. - ...

Frank J. Moffltt, Dr. Woolaey, G. W.
Baker and R. M. McKillican returned to

Ex-Senator Moffitt is ready foÂ»- cam
paign work and now sees much to ad
mire in Populism. The ardent Democrat
said to-night:
''The Populist convention was not a
beer garden filled witn would-be orators
and howling cranks, but as dignified and
deliberate a body as I ever saw. Most of
its members were ex-Governors, ex-Con
gressmen, United States Senators and
members of the present Congress. The
speeches were eloquent and the men were
all sincere. They were not long-bearded,
as the caricaturist makes out, but Popn
lists who were dressed just as neatly as
any other delegate of any other conven
tion.
"Jerry Simpson is not 'sodkless,' but is
a bright, genial gentleman who was edu
catco in a college and has a degree. He
is companionable and was particularly
agreeable to the California!)?.
'Cyclone Davis, of whom so much is
said, is a tall, well-educated gentleman
and an able talker. I do not know any
body in this town who can talk as sensi
bly or as well as he upon political events.
"Congressman Lafe Pence is nnothei
leading Populist whom we met. He now
liven in New York and is an attorney-at
law, but formerly represented Colorado,
rie is a neat-appearing and bright-looking
young gentleman, not over 35 years of
a^e, and as entertaining and companion
able a man as we ever met, and he spent a
great deal of his time with the delegates
from California and made many friends.
"I have changed my mind a good deal
on the Populistsâ so would anybody if
they saw their National Convention.
Tliey are not long-bearded, loud-moutheu
cranks, as many make them out to >;e, but
are cood, living, sensible, well-dressed, in
telligent, enrnest, honest men. Tnere was
no more honesty or dignity or intelligence
in either me Republican or Democratic
National Convention than there was in
the Populist gathering."

Porter Is Worse ThaD He In
Ths Respect.
ALAMEDA, Cal., July 30.â Editor Fred
R. Porter of the Oakland Echoed has a
grievance agninsl T. G. Daniells, editor
of the AJameda Argus. It is not known
when existing relations were otherwise.
Mr. Porter is president of the Second
Ward Republican Club in Oakland and is
quite a power in politics in that city. He
considers he has been libeled by Editor
Daniells, and his attorney, Colonel E. M.
Gibson, has demanded a retraction from
him or the aid of courts will be sought.
Colonel Gibson writes as follows:
Oakland, Cal., July 25, 1896.
T. O. DaniclU Esq.. Editor Daiiy Argus, Ala
medaâDear Sir: The issue ot your paper of
the 21st inst. contains an article in the edi
torial column thereof referring to F. R. Por
ter, manager of tne Oakland Echoes, which Is
considered grossly litelous. said article con
tains the following: '-CongresbmÃn Uilboru
has addressed the only political letter be tia*
put forth this season to >\ B. Porter. Birds oi
an odor. It is one o: the screaming jokes that
Porter is the president oi the Second Ward Ke
puDlican Clud, Oakland, without being on the
register or having a voie. There is a very
great reason why Porter's name does not ap
pear on the great register ana why he docs noc
vote."
It seems to me it is plainly your duty as the
editor of a public journal that you become
satisfied, as you can by a brief examination of
the official great register of this county, thai
tbe statement referred to Is untrue, and that
you do your victim the justice as lar as pos
sible by a full and immediate retraction.
I believe that H you make a full retraction
of .said libelous statement, showing that you
liave unwittingly or otnerwise done Mr.
Porter an injustice, the matter may be brought
to a conclusion without going to court.
Mr. Porter is unquestionably a legally quali
fied voter, slid I am afraid that bo:n you and
lie will vote the goldbug ticket.
I wili be pleased to have you Inform me im
mediately as to your intentions in regard to
this matter, as we shall be governed accord
ingly. Very respectfully, E. M. Gibson.
Mr. Daniells, in speaking of the matter
this evening, said: "No, I am not going
to retract. His name is not on the preat
regis'.er. I have looked â others have
looked â and his name does not appear
there. The nearest name iike his is one
printed Poster. The way I came to get
hold of it was in course of conversation
with Home gentlemen in Oakland. One
made the remark that Porter was presi
dent of the Second Ward Club, ana an
other said that was impossible, as he was
a criminal and his name could not be on
the great register. I have no fear of being
brought into court by him. He has
libeled me times without number and I
nave one case already in the stocks for
him now. I intend answering Colonel
Gibson's letter, but I shall retract noth
ing."

very warm friends, of the bride and had
sent an elegant present with the accept

BUSINESS RUIN FOLLOWS AFTER FREE TRAD
Woolen- Mills Are Idle and
American Workmen
Suffering.
REMEDY IN PROTECTION
English Shoddies Flood the Mar
ket and Destroy Home
Industries.
WILSOH'B BILL AIDS ESGLAHD.
How Democratic Laws Have Hurt
Labor and Destroyed Commerce
in Two Tears.
The ruin wronght by the Democratic
policy of free trade in the wool industry
of tbe United States in less than two years
bas been so widespread as to seriously af
fect almost every other industry by sym
pathy.
It has been shown in two previons arti
cles on tbe subject (in Thx Call of
Wednesday and Thursday) that the Ameri
can wool market bas succumbed to tbe in
jurious effects of the Wilson bill. Lest the
casual reader imagine that the business
i- a limited one it is well to take a general
survey of its extent, so that some idea
may be obtained of tbe area of industry
paralyzed by the policy formulated by
Wilson and championed by William Jen
nings Bryan- in Congress when he was
proud of tbe name, "Boy Orator of the
Platte."
The report of the Commissioner of
Agriculture for Jannary, 18& i. shows tnat
tbe wool business was hurt as early as
1898 by the threat of the Democrats, who
were anxious to put wool on the free list.
In 1893, fearing that the Wilson oill would
be passed, a number of growers had sev
erai millions of sheep slaughtered, and
that year tne value of American sheep fell
from $125,000,000 to $90,000,000, a dead loss
of over $35,000,000. Add to this tbe decline
in woo! and of farms and ranches hereto
fore devoted to sheep and wool raising,
which is not less than the loss of the
sheep, and tbe loss to farmers that year
was $70.000,(XJ0.
Under protection tbe sheep-raisine and
wool-growing industries of the United
States were established; under that sys
tem, tbe system of Clay and Blame, a mil
lion American fiockmasters have invested
$200,000,000, and they pay out $24,000,000
in wages every year. Under that system
the manufacturers of woolens have in
vested over $300,000,000 in 3000 factories,
and paid their employes $76,<j00,000 each
year.
Under two years of tbe Wilson bill nearly
every form of the wool industry bas gone
to the wall, fiockmasters are ruined, fac
tories are idle, and employes alone are
losing a third of a miilion dollars a day.
But what was tbe claim of Bryan when
he made bis famous speech in Congress in
defense of tne bill that has since laid low
the industries of the conntry? During the
first session of the Fifty-third Congress
Bryan said: "I believe -in putting raw
material on the free list, and I believe we
have left far more tariff (on manufactures)
than can be shown to be necessary to pro
vide for any difference, if there be any
difference, between tbe cost of manufac
tures h*re and abroad." Again this most
unreliable prophet said : "If we cheapen
tbe price oi woolen goods we shall not
only be able to export woolens, as we now
export manufactures of cotton, etc., but
we shall increase the consumption of such
goods among the people; and every in
crease in consumption increases tbe de
mand for labor, which results in more
constant employment and better wages."
Thus it will be seen that the "Boy Ora
tor of the Platte" was at once a promiser
and a prophet. He promised most of all,
and his tips were as roses. What are the
facts? The statistics issued by Demo
cratic officials sho v that 60 per cent of
American woolen-mills are idle, that more
than half the laborers are hungry, and
that cheap foreign shoddies are flooding
the American market. West of the Mis
souri River tc-day tbere are 50,000,000
pounds of wool that cannot be moved, be
cause the market is so dead tnat dealers
will neither take the staple on consign
ment nor advance money to growers.
UndÂ«r the McKinley bill, as any market
report will sbow, the prices of American
wool were 44 per cent higher than the
London markets, while now they are 33
per cent below them.
For the nine months ending March,
1895, we imported $27,000,000 ot foreign
woolen goods, but for the nine months
ending March, 1896, we imported $47,000,
-000. Tbe difference is a loss of $20,000,000
to American laborers and manufacturers.
Why? Because every pound of goods im
ported represents just so much less wool
bought in America and just so much less
pa:d to American wa.e-earners.
In tbe speech quoted from, the Demo
cratic candidate for tbe Presidency said :
"There is no probability that tbe sheep
industry will be more injuriously affected
by free wool than it has been by protec
tion."
How do Mr. Bryan's forecasts tally with
the facts from Democratic officials, above
quoted? How does bis picture of pros
perous labor agree with the facts? No one
can deny that 60 per cent of the American
woolen mills â mills that were busy in 1893
âare now siknt. Take Lawrence, Mass.,
as a fair illustration. There the three
large mills are closed. What is the result?
Thirty thousand men, women and chil
dren, wtiose bread was sure under the Mc-
Kinley bill, are absolutely idle, pleading
for employment and eager to hear again
the sound of spindles and looms.
Where now is Bryan's prophecy that
under free wool tbe American would
manufacture for a wider market? Under
tbe McKinley bill the importations of
cheap shoddy were $1,250,000 a year, but
under t c Wilson bill cheap shoddies are
coming in to tbe enormous extent of $20,
-500,000 a year. This has cheapened the
quality of gcods usfd, ruined American
manufactures and done harm to the
masses.
Mr. Holden of the Napa Woolen Mills
owns part of a mill in New Hampshire.
He says that his mill, under the Mo
Kinley bill, used Ohio fleece and Califor
nia and Oregon wools mixed for making
. clotn for buitgy-topo. Now, however, in
order to meet tbe foreign competition, bis
firm has to use 75 per cent shoddy, raized
with 25 per cent of long Australian wool.
Charles Hall, of Hall Bros., heavy
manufacturers at Norwich, Conn., was
f recently in San Francisco. While here
, he said :
"At Morley, England, I saw factories
running day and night to make goods for
the United States market. They were
made of cotton warps and seamed shoddy,
imported into this country as woolen
goods and sold in large quantities."
WLile at Moriey Mr. Hall succeeded,
after much trouble, in finding the prices
paid workmen tbere. It is interesting to
compare it, as a sample of free-trade
wages, with tbe prices paid at Hall Bros.'
mills in Connecticut. The wages in Eng
land were as follows:
Girls, running two weaving machines,
|2 88 a week; boys in card -room, (5 a
week; boss weavers, $1 44 a day; boss
spinners, $7 20 a week; mule spinners,
$2 16 a week ; ooss dyers, $1 92 a day.
The American wages for the same work
were as follows: Girls, running two weav
ing machines. $7 a week; boys in card
room, $9 a week; boss weavers, |3 a day;
boss spinners, $15 a week ; mule spinners,
$7 to |S a week ; boas dyers, $4 a day.
It will be seen at a glance why tbe Eng
lish mills compete and why the American
laborers are idle in the treat milling cen
ters. Where, then, has Mr. Bryan's policy
been heralded with joy? In England,
where the wool industry has been stimu
lated by the Bryan- Wilson policy of free
trade.
The following is a picture from an Eng
glisb view-point It is from an English
trade circular issued in London by Messrs.
Helmuth, Schwartz 4 Co., and it shows in
every sentence that tbe free-crade policy
of Mr. Bryan has helped the Englishmen,
as it cas depressed tbe American dealer:
The domia&nt factor in the past twelve
months has been the recovery and rapid de
ve.opment of the export trade ot wool and
woolens to the United States under the stimu
lating influence of free wool and reduced du
ties on goods. The improvement iinDatfently
expected from the American tariff reform has
thus at length been fuilj- realized. The statis
tical returns of the excort trade to the United
Siatea revealed every month * vast amount of
business, but though this kept on with undi
minishing force, the value of wool up to July
had hardly budged, and it was only tn July,
after six months ot most splendid business
with the United States, that this incubus was
removed and a lasting impression made upon
prices. The bad legacy of heavy stocks which
1894 bequeathed has been got rid of, and while
it may teem remarkable that one single year
should produce this fundamental change, vet
the American tariff reform and the consequent
American demand have undoubtedly accom
plished ii. Under iv influence the industry
is expanding, and mills are being built or en
larged in England and on the Continent. It is
to be hoped that fresh American tariff changes
in an adverse direction may not impair these
hopeful and healthy conditions.
That is what Bryanism accomplished
for England. In contrast with this tbe
reader ought to study the report of Thomas
Dolan, made at the National Association
of Manufacturers, held at Chicago on Janu
ary 2. Here is what he bad to say:
In 1860 the ralne of the manufactured
product of the United States was but $1,900,
-000,000. This represented the total gain from
toe foundation of the Government. Between
1860 and 1890 the gain was nearly $7,500,
-000,000, or in thirty years about 3UO per cent
more than the total gain in the seventy years
down to 1860, rising to the immense sum of
$9300,000,000. The period of this enormous
advance was trie period in which the policy of
just protection to American industry was ea* j
forced without interruption, ana I confidently
affirm tnat ii we are again to be permitted to
, make such headway, we must restore to Ameri
can manufacturers the measure oi protection
1 which will permit them to conduct their
operations without menace trom the foreigners
who have conditions different from ours, and
which give to our rivals advantages that
should be neutralized at our own ports.
And for this havoc with the American
sheep-grower, woolen manufacturer and
laborer, what have the Democrats given
the country? They promised cheaper
! goods and more prosperous times. No one
\ will for a moment ar'^ue that tbe times are
; prosperous. Tben what may be said about
: the saving to the people in tne way of
cheaper clotbinc? That, too, is a myth.
, Under the McKinley law tbe highest tariff

THE SOLID SEVEN ON THE VERGE OF DESPAIR
Startling Revelations of
Guilt May Be Made
To-Day.
GRAND JURY WITNESS.
A Subpena is Out for a Weil-
Known Corporation
Man.
C. I. TAYLOR'S ATTITUDE.
Apprehensive That the Promised
Witness Will Evade the Jury's
Summons.
The Grand Jury has determined to make
further inquiry into certain transactions
in the Board of Supervisors. The fore
man of the jury will not divulge informa
tion in detail. He simply says: "We are
eoing deeper."
It is certain that information has reached
the Grand Jury that a man prominently
connected with one of the leading corpo
rations, recently favored by the seven ac
cused Supervisors, left tbe City Wednes
day evening.
Mr. Maskey was asked yesterday if the
name of this individual could be given.
In reply he said : "You will know more
of this incident to-morrow. The Grand
Jury is not going to adjourn until the
matter with the Supervisors is settled.
We are going deeper."
It is said that the departure of this man,
whose name Mr. Maskey would not di-
Tulge, created some comment among
Supervisors. Rumor had it that he re
ceived a hint that a G^and Jury subpena
had been issued summoning him to attend
the session to-day.
This is the true story of the incidents
connected with the discovery of an im
portant witness who may go before the
Grand Jury to-day and tell something that
may lead up to the indictment of more
than one Supervisor: When the Grand
Jury adjourned one day last week Theo
dore Payne and Frank P. McLennan, tne
secretary, were met in a corridor of the
new City Hall by a well-known citizen,
who said he could give them the name of
an individual of high standing, who could
impart the information concerning certain
Supervisors which the jury was so anxious
to obtain.
The jurors were, of course, hishly grati
fied at the prospect of positive proof. The
name was given and an engagement'
formed to bring about an interview with
the prospective witness: The hour fixed
for the interview was 1 o'clock Saturday,
and the place Theodore Payne's office.
At tbe appointed hour on Saturday
Messrs. Payne and McLennan were on
hand to keep their part of the engage
ment. They waited for an hour, but no
one else came. They were disappointed,
but not discouraged. It was then agreed
that Mr. Payne should undertake to find
an 1 interview the man whose name had
been given as the possessor of important
information.
In due time Mr. Payne found the man,
talked with him and submitted the facts
of the interview to the foreman of the
Grand Jury. Yesterday a subpena was
issued for the man in question, but soon
the rumor spread that the expected wit
ness left the City Wednesday evening.
Last evening Mr. Payne was asked if he
could give tbe name of the witness who
was supposed to know something of the
peculiar transactions of the seven Super
visors. As the matter was not a Grand
Jury secret, he was willing to say that a
citizen of high standing and a man well
known in tne community had promised
or reluctantly consented to appear before
the Grand Jury to-morrow and tell what
he knew of transactions with certain Su
pervisors.
"Can you give the name of tbe gentle
man?"
"It is not prudent or proper to do so at
tbis time," replied Mr. Payne.
"Have you heard that he left the City
last night?"
"I heard so to-day," said Mr. Payne,
"but I do not credit the information that
be has gone from tbe City. He stands too
high in the community and is identified
with too many interests and corporations
to be away any great length of time. "
"He may have gone out of town for a
few days. I believe yet that he will appear
to-morrow in answer to the subpena and
truthfully tell us what he knows. Recol
lect, be did not seek to come before the
Grand Jury and does not desire to come,
but I take him to be a man who will not
shirk a duty even if it is a disagreeable
one."
"If it is not a Grand Jury secret, what

barm can come of letting his name be
known?
"This harm," said Mr. Pavne. "It is
possible that some business has called him
out of town. Should it appear in the news
papers that be hnd disappeared and the
Grand Jury be credited with the announce
ment that he had run away to avoid
service, be might feel justly indignant
and consider that tbc Grand Jury had
acted imprudently. He has nothing to
fear himself. What he has agreed to tell
under oath is in the interest of justice."
"Are there many witnesses called for
the meeting to-morrow ?' '
"I have heard of only two, but there
may be others."
"Is this expected important witness con
nected with the Spring Valley Water Com
pany, or v.ith the transportation or light
companies?"
"Well, you might guess if I should des
ignate the corporation, but I can say that
he is not identified with the water com
pany. If he does not respond to-morrow
1 think there will be some good explana
tion of his absence and notice given ween
he expects to return.
"The jury is not going to adjourn right
away. Should he be absent to-morrow
we can wait a reasonable time for his re
turn to tt.e City."
Frank P. McLennan, secretary of the
Grand Jury, was seen last evening. He
said he understood that important testi
mony regarding the action of certain
Supervisors would be submitted to the
Grand Jury to-day. "The little seed that
we planted the other day has been watered
and now promises to bear fruit," con
tinued Mr. McLennan.
"I do not know what this testimony
will be and would not tell if I did, but I
do not mind saying that we understand
that Mr. Payne, who was detailed to inter
view a well-known citizen, has been in
communication with an important wit
ness. I do not know the name of tnis
witness. No, Ido not know that this wit
ness left the City yesterday. I have not seen
Mr. Payne to-day, but talked with him
over the telephone a few minutes ago."
A member of the Grand Jury whose
name is at present withheld expressed the
opinion that direct bribery was not re
sorted to by the corporation in the matter
of lowering the assessments. He said:
"The action of the seven Supervisors in
the assessment reduction was part of the
general agreement formed shortly after
the board was organized, by which seven,
if not eight, of the members consented to
take care of the gas, water and street rail
way corporations in all municipal legisla
tion.
"It is a proposition, plain on its face,
that some agent or attorney of the inter
ested corporations gives out a hint occa
sionally to enlighten the ring Supervisors.
Some one Supervisor in the compact may
be trusted to signal or inform his asso
ciates as to what course should be pur
sued.' 1
Supervisor Taylor was very much molli
fied yesterday when he heard that the
board had rescinded its action in taking
tne matter of municipal department ap
propriations out of the hands of the
Finance Committee, of which he is the
head, and was in consultation with Super
visor Hughes, the author of the rescinding
motion, for several hours. In fact, he has
arranged for a vacation trip to Supervisor
Hughes' mines in Butte County when the
board tases its annual rest.
"I am not at all sorry that the Grand
Jury has taken up this matter of the
bribery of Supervisors," he said, "but I
fear that their efforts to probe the matter
will prove futile.
"The man who spoke to me of the cor
ruption among a certain clique in the
board has been subpenaed to appear before
the Grand Jury, but there is a serious
question in my mind whether he will
make his appearance at the time set,
owing to the publicity that has been given
this affair through the columns of The
Call.
"There is not the slightest doubt in my
mind that certain Supervisors have been
receiving money from the outside, that
they had no right to receive, to protect
the interests of certain corporations.
"How many of these officials have bene
fited by the deal I am not prepared to
say, but it will probably ail come out now
under the Bearchlight of the Grand Jury."
THOSE NEW STEAMERS.
Southern Pacific Officials Would tike
to See the Japanese Ship*
Coining Here.
The anticipated conference in con
nection with the prospective Japanese
steamship line to the Pacific Coast of the
United States did not take place yesterday.
The Japanese representatives who are in
this City for the purpose of making inves
tigations and obtaining information re
garding United States ports have stated
that they will invite a meeting with
Southern Pacific officials, the Traffic Asso
ciation and other public commercial
bodies. So far they have made no ad
vances in this direction.
General Traffic Manager Smnrr of the
Southern Pacific said yesterday : "We have
not yet had an interview with those gen
tlemen and as far as we know nothing has
been done so far in the interest of San
Francisco with regard to thiÃ enterprise."
"Your company would rather see San
Francisco chosen at the American port for
the new line than the Puget Sound ports
or San Diego?"
"Most certainly. Oar people have vast
interests here circling about San Francisco
and naturally would prefer to see the
steamers coming to San Francisco. I
shali be very glad to meet the gentlemen
â the Japanese representatives â and talk
with them. They will want to know what
inducements San Francisco can offer them.
So far as we are concerned we shall con
sider their propositions and meet them
half way."
The Traffic Association had taken no
steps in tLe matter, and Manager Curtis
was waiting to hear from the Japanese
who have the selection of a port for their
line in their power.

TRADE WITH AUSTRALIA.
United States Consul Bell Says
We Are Neglecting a
Chance.
A Wonderful Commercial Country,
but America Gets Little of Its
Business.
Colonel George W. Bell, United States
Consul at Sydney, arrived here yesterday
from Australia, and will address the Cham
ber of Commerce this afternoon at 3 o'clock
upon tne commercial prospects of the
different countries that have ports on the
Pacific Ocean. Tbis is a subject to which
he has given much attention, particularly
with regard to the possibilities of the
United States as a factor .in Australian
trade.
"Australia," said he last night at the
Occidental, "leads the world in commerce.
Its imports and exports are as great as
those of any other country with five times
the population. There is a large number
of rich people in Australia. The result is
Australia buys more and sells more than
any other country on the globe.
"We get about 6 per cent of the whole
Australian trade, and about 2}Â£ per cent of
the trade with Sydney. We ought to have
40 per cent of the trade. If we had a
strong steamer line from here to Australia,
a line such as is in operation between
England and Australia, we could secure
more of the trade. Then there might very
easily be shipments of fresh fruits both
ways in season, for when it is summer
here it is winter in Australia. Fresh fruits
are snipped to England, a distance of
12,000 miles, and I don't see why they
couldn't be shippedjto this country, only
half that distance.
"Australia has some fine fruit country,
but most of it is undeveloped. They are
not handling their fruit well or giving
proper attention to variety. NÂ«w South
Wales is a particularly good fruit country."
Colonel Bell is an old-time journalist,
lecturer and speculator, who has lived in
Washington State and lowa. He has been
Consul at Sydney for nearly three years.
Recently, upon invitation, he addressed
the Chambers of Commerce of Brisbane,
Sydney and Melbourne and like organiza
tions in the colonies. From here he will
go to Washington State, and thence to
Washington, D. C, returning here in a
month and a half on his way back to
Sydney. He will address the Chambers of
Commerce of Portland ahd Seattle and
probably of Chicago, by all of which he
has been invited to speak.

DOBBERTIN'S
"KISS OF DEATH."
His Latest Group Is Now
Standing Finished in
His Studio.
SKETCHED IN A NIGHT.
The Idea Came to Him at a
High Jinks of the Press
Club.
IS FULL OF DEEP MEANING.
Declared by All to Be a Most Beauti
ful and Artistic Crea
tion.
Ott3 Doboertin, sculptor, has created
bis masterpiece. It is called by him the
"Kiss of Death." A singular feature of
the affair is that the idea came to him
one night at a high jinks of the Press
Club.
He denies that the Press Club was
wholly responsible for the stimulus to his
imagination, but says the spirit was upon
him when he first attended those mys
terious festivities of a whole moon ago.
Then, he says, the desire for artistic crea
tion became so strong in him that
he left the esoteric rites about midnight
and betook himself to his studio, where he
labored feverishly on a shapeless mass of
wet clay until long after the sun had
arisen of ihe following day. When he
rested he saw before him the first sketch
of his masterpiece, the "Kiss of Death."
Since then he has labored fourteen days
in building up a half life-sized composi
tion of the idea thought out that night.
The composition work is done, and the
strong lines of the subject are beautifully
portrayed. Now remains the delicate
touches, the infinitesimal chips of the
chisel that briug out the complete con
ception.
The work shows a yonth closely clasped
in the embrace of a sphinx. His lips meet
hers in the act of kissing. A lyre in his
right hand seems on the point of falling
from his grasp, while laurel leaves that
before formed a wreath on his head now
lie scattered at his feet. The face of the
sphinx is that of a beautiful woman, but
sensual and passionate. Her body is that
of a lioness, and is crouched upon a rock.
The fore paws clasp the body of the youth.
The work is an epitome ot the history of
love. The ideal conquered by the mate
rial. The poet conquered in the moment
of his highest aspiration by the love of
tbis world.
The poet has looked toward the sphinx,
and the look has cost him his life. His
lips find hers, his lyre falls and he ex
periences the kiss that meant death to
those lofty serener thoughts of solitude.
"I sketched it in a single night," said
Mr. Dobbertin, "the thought came upon
me so ttrong. It is the conquest of art by
the animal love oi the world. Ahâ the
sohinx â her face expresses the whole mys
tery of it. The poet is making the last
effort for freedom, but he is caught and
drawn down when he leasts expect* it.
As my friend Sanchez says, 'Life without
art is life without heart.' Here is life and
art to the uttermost, but art lost in life.
It typifies a sacrifice on the altar of the
world."
BOTH WANTED THE DOG,
A Bitter Legal Fight Over a
Canine in Justice Barry's
Court.
The Anircal Went to Either of the
Litigants and the Court Was
Puzzled.
"Here, Sport! Here, Sport!"
"Come, Sandy ! Here, Sandy !"
"Gentlemenâ"
"Here, Sport. See that, Judge, how he
comes to me."
"Nice old Sandy; knows his master,
does he?"
"Your Honor, I objectâ"
"Bow, wow, wow."
These and other expressions, human
and canine, would hayÂ« formed a portion
of the record of Justice Barry's court yes
terday had a stenographer been an adjunct
to the tribunal, but as it was a very few of
them found their way into Judge Barry's
notebook.
Henry Payne was suing Stephen Case
nelli for tbe possession of a bright, intelii
gent-looking spaniel, both the parties
claiming to have raised the dog and to
know every spot on his wriggling body,
whue the canine complicated matters by
acknowledging both owners.
irooa the appearance of the courtroom
all of Ran Bruno was present to support
one side or the other. Michael Higgins
appeared with the dog, who was called
Sport by Payne and Sandy by Caaenelli,
and then the swearing began.
Both of the principals identified the dog
positively, and each was supported by a
dozen ot equally positive witnesses. In
an unguarded moment Judge Harry had
the custodian of tne beast lead him to the
front and commanded both litigants to
call him and see which he would answer.
He had reason to regret his action
within a moment, for the succession of
yells and shouts that arose from the op
posing factions drowned even the frantic
hammering of his gavel, and the dog, to
complicate matters, rushed first to one
and i.hen the other, showing equal affection
for both.
Under the circumstances the court took
the matter under advisement, bis remarks
leading to the belief that tbe defendant
would get the benefit of the doubt.
HAYWARDS WEDDINGS.
Rev. K. E. Wenk Explains tbe Manner
In Which They Took
Place.
Tbe following self-explanatory com
munication from Rev. R. E. WiÂ»nk of
Haywards in reference to certain mar
riages performed by him recently was
received yesterday :
I performed the marriage ceremony for Her
bert S. Bradley and Honors Brannan, both of
Oakland, and on Juiy 22 I did a like ser
vice for Oscar W. Seaton and Ida S. Paterson
of San Francisco. In both instances h license
properly issued Mas produced, all questions
were satisfactorily answered, and a suitable
number of reputable witnesses were present.
There was nothing secret or suspicious, nor
wns there any request that reporters be not
informed.
In each case I stated that I would have the
marriages properly recorded and published,
which I did the uext day. 1 have not been ap
plied to by any other parties from Oakland or
dan Francisco recently to perform the mar
riage ceremony. K. E. We>'K,
Pastor Metnodist Episcopal Church, Hay
wards, Cal.
EARLY HOURS DEMANDED
Dry-Goods Men Assign Reasons
for Six O'Cicck Closing
on Saturdays.
Call for a Mass-Meetingâ Aid Will Be
Asked of the Ladies' Benev
olent Societies.
The Dry-goods Men's Early Closing As
sociation held its second regular meeting
at K. R. B. Hall, corner Mason and O'Far
rell streets, last night. The room was
packed with members, and great enthusi
asm developed during the progress of the
meeting over the early closing movement.
At the last session of the organization a
committee was apnomted to wait on the
directors of the Emporium and request
them to close their dry-goods department
at 6 o'clock on Saturday evenings. This
committee reported that such had been
done, but, being unable to see the di
rectors, it had conferred with William D.
Harper, the general manager.
The latter was quoted aa being in favor
of the idea, but informed the committee
that they would be obliged to send in a
written communication to the directors,
stating their desire and the reasons there
for.
This they reported they had done, but
as yet had received no answer, whereupon
they were requested again to wait upon
the directors and if possible to obtain a
definite answer.
The communication sent to the Em
porium directors states that smaller firms
and corporations will follow their lead in
closing at 6 p. M. Saturdays, and states
that nothing will be lost by so doing, as
purchasers will make it a point to do all
their shopping prior to 6 o'clock if all
stores close at that hour.
Various members suggested different
ways of proceeding to effect a closing.
Among them was the idea of making an
appeal to the Native Daughters, Women's
Relief Corps, Daughters of the Revolution
and Kindred organizations to buy no goods
of dry-goods firms working their employees
till 10 o'clock Saturday evenincs. This
suggestion met with a noisy and unani
mous approval.
A committee on permanent organization
was appointed as follows:
P. Slattery. of the Maze; J. Clarkson, of
Hale Brothers; J. Roberts of Kohlberg,
Strauss & Frohman; D. 8. Costello, of J.
J. O'Brien's, and M. Cousins, employed in
the White House.
A resolution to make the temporary of
ficers permanent was defeated on the
ground that they were all employed by
the same establishment and the "officers
should be distributed among the various
firms.
It was resolved that after permanent or
ganization bad been established a mass
meeting should be held at which well
known citizens should be asked to speak
for and encourage them in the attainment
of their expectations.
The Dry-goods Men's Early Closing As
sociation is really a reorganization, the
first body having been organized about
four years ago. At that time tney real
ized their hopes in securing the consent
of all firms to close their doors early Sat
urday evenings.
Broke a Big Window.
At 11 o'clock Wednesday night two men en
gaged in a fight on Montgomery street and one
hurled a rock at the other. The rock missed
the mark and crashed through a large plate
gloss window in Hart Bros.' tailoring estab
lishment at 116 Montgomery street. The noise
caused considerable excitement for a time.
The two men escaped in the darkness after
being pursued for two blocks by Policeman
Holmes.
