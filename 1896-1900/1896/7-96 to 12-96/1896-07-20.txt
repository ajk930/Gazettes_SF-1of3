"The Call's" Headquarters, )
Lindell H.Â»tÂ«l, [
St. Loaii, Mo., July 19.)
A careful can vans made to-night shows
that the Solid South, with Wyoming,
Texas and California, is opposed to
fusion or to indorsing; Bryan or any
other man. The Straight Populists will
put up a straight ticket, no matter what
the convention may do.
â¢ "Who is he?" asked a friend this morn
ing as a small, slim man, dressed in sober
black with Prince Albert coat buttoned
loosely around his shrunken frame, stood
conversing with a man who looked like
Santa Clans in the lobby of the Lindell
Hotel. The slim man wore a brown beard,
which reached down to a level with his
stomach. He looked like a professor of
Hebrew roots. There was the schoolmaster
in every motion. His features were of the
Dutch cast, rendered more so by a tapering
crowned, black slouch hat which he wore.
His nose was long, thin and prominent,
with a high bridge, and his forehead im
mediately above the brows was well de
veloped. A pair of gold-rimmed spectacles
added to the professional air of the mild
mannered man, while the long whiskers
and a pair of gold-rimmed eye-glasses
with a tine gold chain attached to the right
Japei of his coat, made it apparent that he
â¢was a literary man or a student.
â  : This mild mannered man of the student
air was Senator Peffer of Kansas, whose
whiskers have formed the theme for many
a jibe on the part of Eastern newspaper
correspondents.. Funny writers, not of
the Populistic faith, have pictured Senator
Peffer as a man with wild oats in his
whiskers and cyclones blowing through
them at intervals. They have also , un
kindly and untruthfully represented him
as an uncouth, vulgar specimen oi Kansas
civilization. The short conversation which
I had with him to-day convinced me that
this man has been most unjustly treated
by the writers for the press. I found him
to be just what he looked like, a gentle
man of considerable refinement and educa
tion, well read in the current literature of
the day, and a student earnestly Peeking
after the truth in the line of political econ
omy. His voice is like his eye, soft and
gentle, his manners suave and unassuming.
The Senator said in answer to a question
lhat in all probability Bryan "would be in
dorsed By the Populist and Bilver conven
tions, but that much trouble would be ex
SENATOR MARION BUTLER OF NORTH CAROLINA,
One of the most prominent opponents of the indorsement of Bryan by the Populisis is Senator
Butler. He favors a coalition with the Republicans in his State/the terms of the proposition being
that Senator Pritchard should be returned to the United States Senate and the patronage of the
State should be equally^ divided between the Republicans and Populists, the Populists agreeing to
give their electoral ticket to the Republicans.
The San Francisco Call.
perienced from the Populists in that mat
ter. He declined to say what bis own
opinions were.
â¢'The Southern Populists and tne Demo
crats do not agree very well." said tne
Senator. "The great majority of the
Populists of the South were formerly
Democrats and they were so badly treated,
being abused and having their votes
stolen, that they feel very bitter toward
their old-time brothers of the Democracy.
We are trying to patch up these differ
ences by fusion on Presidential electors."
The Senator has done good service for
his country, not only with tongue and
pen, but with a rifle during the Civil War.
He was born in Cumberland County,
Pennsylvania, in 1831, of Dutch stock, and
has a constitution so \igorous, notwith
standing his spare appearance, that be
does not seem to be any more than 40. He
was reared on a farm and at the age of 15
began to teach school, and it was probably
the taking up of this profession at an age
so early that has imparted to him the air
of gravity which he now wears. Then he
went prospecting for mining lands during
several months and returned with 25 cents
in his pockeU In 1552 he married and in
1853 he and his wife went to St. Joseph
County, Ind., where he followed the busi
ness of farming. In 1859 they left Indiana
and took up their residence in South
western Missouri.
At the breaking out of the Civil War,
Senator Peffer, imbued with patriotism,
went through Illinois and joined the
Army 6t the Cumberland as a private,
and after having been out about eight
months was promoted to the position of
second lieutenant. He also tilled the po
sitions of quartermaster and judge advo
cate, and it was wLile acting as judge
advocate that be began the study of the
law.
He engaged in several battles, the most
notable of which were the attack on Fort
Donelson in February, 1862, and the Battle
of Nasuville in December, 1864. He re
mained in the army until the close of tbe
war and in 1870 removed to Kansas, where
he practiced law for a while, and finding
that it was not a money-making business
abandoned it for the humble occupation
of farming land and editing a newspaper.
He is at present editor of the Kansas
Farmer, and that is all the work he does
outside of his duties as a United States
Senator. The Senator was formerly a
Republican, but for the past ten years be
has been practically a Populist. He, How
ever, did not leave the Republican party
until 1889.
The Senator told a story of a mistake
made by Senator Ingalls. Inealls' term
was to expire in December, 1891. Just
prior to that time tbe Farmers' Alliance
Dad been started in Kansas and had made
considerable headway.
"We of that body were anxious to have
Senator Ingalls take up the Farmers' Al
liance and carry it through the cam
paign," said he. "If he had done so he
could have got whatever he wanted po
litically, for his talents were very much
admired by members of that organization.
But Ingalls laughed at us, and thought
that it would cot amount to anything at
all. At that time the Senatorfal term was
six years and his colleague waa senator
Plumb, and we did not feel like taking
any chances, so after waiting three months
for Ingalls we came to the conclusion that
we would have to select some other per
son. I stumped the State for eight weeks
that year, not having any set programme
and jumping from one part of the State to
another.
"The result of the election was a great
surprise. Forty-five thousand Republi
cans and 25-,000 Democrats went out of
their party, and 32,000 of the Union Labor
party affiliated with the People's party of
Kansas, and the victory was won."
Senator Peffer is quite a student. In
tbe midst of his onerous duties as Senator
and editor be finds time to stray away
into the shady paths of art and literature.
His favorite poets are Shelley, Burns,
Byron, Whittier and Longfellow. The
man with whom he was talking, and who
looked so like Santa Claus, with a bright,

CANTON, Ohio, July 19.â Repub
licans expect to conduct a very ; strong
speaking campaign. Major. McKinley's
managers, in looking over the list of avail
able speakers, find that they have more
than fifty men of wide acquaintance and
established reputation upon whom they,
can call. In addition to these well-known
"spell-binders" there are 150 men who
have reputations in their own and neigh

Several committees have been to see ex-

to go to the Pacific Slope and that General
Harrison will make a tour through some

BUTLER OPPOSES BRYAN.
The North Carolina Senator In the
Fight for an Independent
Ticket.
BT. LOUIS, Mo., July 19.â The late
trains this evening brought in quite a
number of delegates and party leaders.
Prominent among them was Senator
Butler of North Carolina. He said to a
reporter, speaking of the proposition to
indorse the Democratic candidates:
"The Democrats would never have de
clared for free silver bad it not been for
the agitation originated and maintained
by the Populists for years. Why should
we now surrender our organization to
them because they have adopted one of
the principles for which we have been
contending?"
Senator Jones of Arkansas, chairman 'of
the National Democratic Committee, ar
rived this evening. He, with Governor
Stone, Chairman Taubeneck of the Popu
lists and others, had a conference. The
session was executive, and when it broke
up there was silence on tbe part of the
participants. BenÂ»tor Jones would only
say that the outlook for harmonious action
by the Populist Convention was assured.
He would not say whether this meant tbe
indorsement of Bryan or a Ojrif'on at the
electoral ticket, but from his satisfied
manner it was assumed that matters had
progressed to a satisfactory understanding.
Governor Stone was more outspoken.
He stated the indorsement of Bryan was
assured, and that the Populists could and
would take that course without forfeiting
party identity or principle. The Governor
went so far as to say thai Bryan would not
stultify himself by accepting some of the
demands of the Populists platform not
touched upon by the Democrats. The
banking clause of the Democratic plat
form was, the Governer thought, the only
obstacle in the way of a perfect under
standing, and upon that both should make
concessions.
Georce F. Washburn of Massachusetts
is out in a statement to-night declaring
for the indorsement of Bryan, in which
he says:
"It is the firat opportunity the American
psople have bad to render a verd ct on the
money question. For a year we have ad
vocated a union of silver forces. I still
adhere to that plan, lo unite means rao
cess; to divide means defeat. Mr. Bryan
indorsed the Populists in Nebraska. It is
our duty to stand by him now. It is far
better for us to win on two or three prin
ciples than to suffer constant defeat on
them all."
Among the arrivals to-night was Mat
Ward of Nebraska, who comes to labor for
the indorsement of Bryan and Sewall by
both conventions this week. He said:
"I am a Nebraska Democrat. After Mr.
Bryan made his speech in tbe Chicago
convention I took his place in the delega
tion and interviewed every State delega
tion on the floor in his behalf. It was by
my personal efforts alone that Alabama
and Mississippi swung into line for him.
Mr. Brvan was nominated without a
pledge and be will be elected without a
pledge. He trusted the Populists and sil
ver men and tbey will have to trust him.
He will not make any arrangements or
enter into any negotiations whatever."
"Suppose Senator Jones, chairman of
the Democratic National Committee, de
sires to make an arrangemen lor the di
vision of Electors, would Mr. Bryan ob
ject to that?" was asked.
â¢â¢I do not believe he would take any
part in the matter," Ward replied. "The
Populists and silver men must trust him,
that's all. This is a contest on principle."
PLEDGE TO POPULISTS.
Bryan's Managers Said to Have
Made Satisractory Over
tures.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., July 19.â 0n the best
authority it can be stated that the late
meeting of certain of the the Populist
leaders with Senator Jones has definitely
fixed a basis for indorsement of Bryan.
Senator Jones was introduced to the meet
ing by Senator Stewart, There were sixty
leaders present, representing every section
of the country. Senator Peffer was chair
man. Hon. Tom Patterson of Colorado,
Le welling, Yonge, Daniels and Breiden
thai of Kansas, Freil Bailey of Oklahoma
and Cantwell were among the prominent
conferrees. Senator Jones stated ihat his
mission was to secure the support of the
Populists for Bryan. He spoke for ten
minutes, and at his conclusion ail were of
one mind. The telling points of his
appeal were these:
"Bryan will know no party distinctions
among those who support him, but will
recogiiize all as patriots working for a
common cause. The Populists will not be
consid red dependent stepchildren of the
Democratic party."
The applause and handshaking that fol
lowed was a sure indication that a bargain
was ratified, bat the actual terms are not
t made public.

ON BOARD STEAMSHIP COLOMBIA,
Ashore oft Pigeon Point (via PeÂ»cadero,
Cal.), July 19.â This was visiting day on
the luckless Colombia. From different
directions all kinds of vehicles, from stage
coaches to bicycles, began to arrive at the
cove early, and by 10 o'clock the beach
was crowded with visitors. Ex-Mayor
Ellert and a party of gentlemen from San
Francisco came on wheels, and Santa
Cruz sent a large delegation to the scene.
It was also visiting day in the lighthouse
and many embraced the opportnnuy to
mount the winding stairs of the tower to
the lamp at the top, 300 feet above the sea.
A large number of people boarded the
stranded steamer and were permitted to
wander through the empty saloons and
staterooms and gather mementoes at will.
| They looked down in the flooded holds,
| where broken cases and ruined merchan
| disc were washing about, and into the
! engine-room, where the great engines lie
drowned. Captain Clark at first objected
to having a crowd of visitors aboard of the
wreck, but not wishing to disappoint those
who came alongside kindly permitted
them to come aboard.
"If they can see anything of interest
around the poor Colombia let them come,"
he said wearily.
At 2 o'clock in the afternoon the Pacific
Coast steamship Corona arrived from San
Francisco, crowded with passengers and
gayly decorated with bunting, a startling
contrast to the other steamer helpless on
the rocks. It has been a beautiful calm,
with the sea smooth as glass, consequently
the entire round trip was like a bay outing
to the excursionists. Colombia Cove,
covered with small boats loaded with
people going to and from the wreck, did
not have the appearance of being the
graveyard of five good ships that have
gone to destruction on its reefs.
Aboard of the stranded vessel the crew
was engaged in sending down booms and
removing sucb parts of the machinery as
were above -the water, and otherwise
linishin the stripping of the steamer. A
portion of the 600 or 700 tons of the cargo
is probably uninjured in the afteriiold.
This will be taken out if the weather con
tinues favorable. After the Pacific Mail
Company has removed all articles pos
sible to get at, the hulk will be sold to the
hk'hest bidder.
The steamer is tightly wedged in the
rocks and hardly moves to the heave of
the sea, and so even is she on her keel
that she appears to be riding safely at
anchor. The forward portion of t lie bot
tom must be totally gone, for the swell
rises and tails in the hold as outside.
At 4 o'clock the Corona raided her
anchor, saluted the Colombia by dipping
her colors and departed for San Francisco.

ROCKFORD, 111., July 19. â James
French, a tailor, met his wife on the street
in the fashionable part of the city this
afternoon and fired eight shots into her
body, killing her. Albert Barker, a prom
inent citizen, was shot in the wrist while
grappling with French, who ran through
tbe streets eight blocks, pursued by an
angry mob of 300 people. He held the
mob at bay on tne river bank, where he
was cornered, but after tiring several shots
without effect he shot himself in the head
and then jumped into the river. French
was dragged out, resuscitated and taken
to the County Jail through the mob, which
made strong threats of lynching. His
wound is not fatal. Jealousy was the
cause of the murder.

Determined to Labor fox the Preser*

Helped to Create.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., July 19.â Writing
as a stalwart Populist, I have good news
for all who seek for genuine reformation
of National affairs on broad lines. All our
positive information gained as we proceed
on our way goes to show that the Bryan
craze is already on the decline. We have
read Teller's letter to Bryan and it did not
elicit a single expression of regret, but
more than one said :
"Good ; we are well rid of a demoralis
ing influence which has distracted some
Populists who have given Bryan as a can
didate of union forces."
Our delegation is in full agreement on
the plan of union set forth in our State
platform. We favor union of the reform
forces, without the surrender of our party
principles. We are unalterably opposed
to fusion. Our party integrity must be
preserved. On this matter we are inflex
ible. This is the attitude of our party in
the South. Taubeneck and others see tna
mistake they made in reference to Bryan.
They have abandoned Bryan and favor
straight Populist action. Nothing is mora
certainly indicative of the great change
among such Populists as have been favor
able to Bryan.
The bold attempt of the silver Democra
cy to supplant the People's party by
adopting tne silver issue and the attempt
of Teller to turn silver Republicans to
Bryan will render an honorable union
with Populists impossible as it now ap
pears, and upon the Bryan and Teller
eiements must rest the responsibility of
dividing the silver forces with all the con
sequences which are certain to follow.
Probably nothing could be done in the
present situation of our dountry which
would result in such decided advantage to
the People's party as a permanent Na
tional organization, though it comes as a
result following the rejection by the Bryan
and Teller element* of the overtures in
favor of union made by the Populists.
Our ride through Kansas to-day has
been thoroughly enjoyable, the weather
being comfortably cool and the sky cov
ered with thick clouds. It has not been a
strictly observed Sunday as church people
observe it, but it has been a decidedly de
votional day among our delegates â devo
tional to their country. This feeling has
found expression in a rallying cry perpe
trated by J. R. Welch of San Jose, which
is shouted at the people gathered at the
stations. It runs thus: "Rah, rah, rahl
We are thirty-nine, hewing to the linel
Gold, silver, paper, that's the true caoerl"
At Pueblo last evening Judf/e Daggettof
Visalia joined the delegation, he having
come ahead to Denver to attend to son>e
legal business. He is an uncompromising
Populist, and goes so far as to oppose any
alliance with any silver forces whatever.
If Teller carries the silver Republicans
over to Bryan, as ro doubt he will, the
genuine Populists will simply ignore these
silver conglomerates who, as old party
men, have much in common and little in
common with Populists, and there Judge
Daggett will have a party with which he
is in full sympathy.

The Call's Headquarters,)
Hotel Lindell, >
St. Loris, Mo., July 19. j
There are only two days intervening be
tween now and the day on which the Na
tional conventions of the Silver and Pop
ulist parties will assemble in this city.
They give promise of being notable and
historical gatherings. It will be the first
National convention of the Silver party.
It may be the last National convention of
the People's party. The issues which ce
ment the former seem to divide the latter.
The silverites are modestly jubilant over
the triumph of six months of party his
tory. The National organization was cre
ated less than half a year ago. They de
clare that they forced the Chicago con
vention to adopt the issue which they had
made before the country and incorporate
it as the chief plank in the platform on
which the Democrats now seek the suf
frage of the people. Now the People's
party are asked to take like action. If It
does not the silverites within its ranks
threaten dire vengeance. Should the Pop
ulists accept these overtures and indorse
the nomination of Bryan they say it prac
tically means the abolition of the party.
Another danger confronts the party in
that the silver wing, which forms an es
sentially strong element of the party, hav
ing declared for Bryan, will bolt tbe ticket
unless he is indorsed, so that the People's
party is threatened with dissolution on
every side, and it will require judicious
action to keep it from utter annihilation.
Interest to-day centered about the arÂ»
rival of Senator Jones, chairman of the
Democratic National Committee. The
Senator came in to-night and soon after
his arrival his rooms at the Planters'
Hotel were besieged by leaders of his own
and other parties. He held a conference
with Senator Stewart, Governor Stone,
Tom Patterson of Colorado and Commit
teeman Tom Alson of Alabama.
Senator Jones will endeavor to "jolly"
the middle-of-the-road Populists. He re
fused to say that he would accept or reject
the Taubeneck fusion plan relative to the
electoral vote. He declares tbat the in
dorsement of Bryan can be had without
making any concessions to the ultra wing
of the People's Party. Many prominent
Democrats, however, believe that he is
mistaken on this point and eventually
will be obliged to meet the anti-Bryan
people at least half way. Patterson re
ported tbat he had met Bryan at Lincoln,
Nebr., and discussed the situation with
him. He said that the Presidential candi
date told him that he would abide by
whatever bis friends did in St. Louis.
The different factions are holding con
ferences to-night and the hot, sultry air is
full of suppressed excitement. The silver
men are trying to sidetrack the Populists.
Should they succeed they will have ac
complished the purpose for which their
party was organized.
As the day approaches on which the two
conventions will be held the confidence of
the silverites in their ultimate triumph
noticeably increases. While the middle
of-the-road Populists were at church to
day the silver men put in their time ham
mering the little boomlets that had
sprung up in opposition to Bryan.
Senator Stewart stood in the lobby of
the Lindeli Hotel to-day and unmercifully
scored tbe anti-Bryan factions assembled
there. He was supported by General
Weaver. During the day Chairman
Taubeneck of the Populist National Com
mittee dropped in. He is especially an
tagonistic to the proposition of indorsing
Bryan. Senator Stewart, knowing his
position, lost no time in engaging him in
consultation. The Senator seemed irrita
ble at tbe attitude lately assumed by
Taubeneck, and he freely expressed his
contempt for him. Taubeneck, he said,
had all along been favorable to tbe in
dorsement of a silver man by the Popu
â  lists.
Stewart had conferred with Taubeneck
during the Chicago convention and some
people Bay there was an understanding
between them as to what course the two
National parties now assembling in St.
Louis should pursue. Those who are on
the inside say tbat Senator Stewart to-day
intimated to Taubeneck that he had prob
ably "seen the light." Jt was not neces
sarily the same light that St Paul had
seen, but nevertheless it came from the
east.
Taubeneck is fighting the. efforts of the
Bryan men to secure the latter's indorse
ment with might and main. He has been
very active all day marshaling the forces
of those who think and act with him, and
he feels especially .encouraged since tne ar
rival of Ignatius Donnelly of Minnesota
to-day. The Baconian theorist and author
is pretty much of the same mind as Mr.
Taubeneck regarding the indorsement of
Bryan, which seems to be the predomi
nating issue now before the Populists.
Donnelly is anxious to continue the exist
ence of the party, of which he claims to
be one of the sponsors. He realizes that a
fusion with tne Democrats would practi
cally mean their absorption by the party
of Jefferson. He is willing to accept the
Taubeneck plan of placing a straight
ticKet in tbe field, and in case the Demo
crats secure a majority to cast the Popu
list vote for Bryan in the Electoral College.
This arrangement seems to be making
considerable headway. Tbo silver men
are hopeful of checkmating it before final
action is taken. General Coxey of Ohio is
lending his aid to Taubeneck and Donnelly
to uphold the principles of the party, and
hold its dividing factions together. He,
too, has proposed a plan for the conven
tion to lollow: Said he:
"Let each State committee of the Demo
cratic, the Populist a&J the Prohibition
parties in the various States pro rata the
number of votes cast by each party at the
last election, then divide the electors, giv
ing to each party according to the votes
shown, all to go on the party's tickets hav
ing the highest number of votes cast in
the State. Alter the election these electors
shall meet in each State and reapportion
the votes of the electors according to
the votes cast for the head of the State
ticket in each State, they to cast their
votes for President as follows : In case the
Democrats have more than either the
People's or the Prohibitionists, they to get
the prey, and if the Populist party comes
in second, they to have Vice-Presidency,
and vice versa: then all of the votes of
Democrats, People's party men and Prohi
bitionists to be cast in tbe electoral college
as stated.
"Under this scheme every vote for silver
would count. Of course in many of the
States the electoral ticket would be prac
tically the Democratic ticket, while in
States already carried by the People's
party the electoral ticket would be prac
tically People's party. In the Western
States, according to last fail's election, the
Democrats had 443.000 votes, while the
Populists bad 551,000; in the South they
have about 1,600,000 to our 600,000. It can
be Been that under this plan we Populists
could in effect unite with all the silver
elements against the gold men and still
not sacrifice our party organization. This
is what we desire to do.
"Again, it is plain to be seen that at the
close of the campaign, with the silver
question settled, our reform press can at
once take up the Govei m nt ownership
and other issnes, including the non-inter
est bond, to educate the people and pre
pare them for greater achievements for
years hence as they have been educated
upon silver during the past few years. I
am hopeful that the delegates will see the
great advantage for after-election pur
poses alone of incorporating my bills in
the platform."
Governor Lewelling of Kansas arrived
here to-day. He is out for Bryan and says
that there is no question but that he will
be indorsed by the Populists.
"Some of our people favor the nomina
tion of Mr. Bryan, but I don't agree with
them. I think we can indorse him, how
ever. That will give general satisfaction
all around. The Kansas delegation is for
him. It will not necessarily disrupt our
party to indorse Mr. Bryan. He is highly
esteemed and will doubtless receive the
vast majority of Populist's votes in our
State." Fbakk McGuiee.
THREATEN A BOLT.
Leading Populists Prefer McKin
ley's Election to Political â¢
Oblivion.
ST, LOUIS, Mo., July 19.â The situation
to-night is Bryan and anti-Bryan. More
strictly speaking, it is Bryan as against
some members of the Populist party yet
to be named.
At the present writing not more than
300 of the 1300 delegates to the Populist
Convention have arrived, and these are
individual members who constitute the j
advance guard of a number of delegations
from the South and West. It is yet too
early to predict with reasonable certainty
what decision the convention may reach,
but from the surface indications to-day it
would appear that the sentiment for Bryan I
will be very strong if, indeed, his friends '
be not in a majority when the roll is
called.
The leaders, so far as they have arrived,
are divided in their preference. Some are
enthusiastic in his support. Among these j
is General J. B. Weaver of lowa, who
made the race for the Presidency on the
Populist ticket four yeais ago. The others,
and among them are Mr. Taubeneck, the
chairman of the National Committee, im
patiently repudiate the suggestion of
Bryan's name and assert that his nomina
tion would fall like a wet blanket upon
the party. Between these two extremes
stand the delegates less known â earnest,
thoughtful men, who are not ambitious of
leadership, desirous only of the good of
the party â who express no opinion but are
willing to accept the convention's wishes,
be they what they may.
There was taik to-day of a bolt if Bryan
be nominated. Bolting, or what is tanta
mount to bolting, has become tbe fÂ«hion
in this campaign, and the Populist lead
ers who oppose Bryan discuss its proba
bility with more indifference, perhaps,
for the object lesson presented to them by
the Republican and Democratic conven
tions. Whom they would select under
these circumstances they do not say.
They have not gone so far as to consider
the question, nor will they until one or
the other horn of the dilemma is presented
to them. They do not hesitate to say'
however, that a bolt would lose to the sil
verites the electoral votes of Kentucky,
Tennessee, Alabama and Florida, and cer
tainly result in the election of McKinley.
This is the threat that may be held over
the heads of their party brethren, but
with what success can only be conjectured.
There is bat one thing tbe anti-Bryan
men fearâ that is the possibility that some
one may make a ringing speech, full of
apt allusions to the coy orator of the
Platte and his long devotion to silver, tbat
may sweep the convention off its feet and
bring about bis nomination in a whirl
wind of enthusiasm* even as Bryan him
self succeeded in doing in Chicago less
than a fortnight ago. In such an event
the list of malcontents might be so re
duced as to make a bolt impossible, but
this is not expected. It is thought that if
Bryan is nominated or indorsed it will be
by sheer force of numbers and not through
any adventitious aids.
The opposition to Bryan springs from
two causes. Tbe first, and this isthe one
most generally advanced, is the complete
obliteration of the party wbich would
follow his nomination, and the second is
a distrust in some quarters that the
Democrats would not act fairly with them
in the division of the electoral vote. Those
who entertain this latter view are Southern
Populists, who claim to have been "counted
out' 1 by their Democratic opponents when
they have carried State and Congressional
elections and who fear that a repetition
of such methods would be practiced this
year if McKinley failed to secure a ma
jority of the Electoral College votes.
But these are in the minority and are
limited to the Southern delegates. The
Northern and Western men entertain no
such fear. Those from that part of the
country who oppose Bryan do so because
they believe that the party that they have
done so much to organize and develop
would be swallowed up in the greater
prestige and prominence of the Demo
cratic party, and that they and the princi
ples they hold would pass from off the
political stage.
Then there is another objection. They
do not like the impression to go out that
they have no men within their own ranks
of sufficient ability to carry their standard
to victory. They are very proud, are these
Populists, ot their political development.
They have seen the party grow from small
beginnings to its present strength, now
estimated to be something in excess of
3,000,000 voters. They have been reviled
and persecuted, they say, on all hands.
Yet they have prospered in spite of these
persecutions, and it is for these reason*
tbat they wish to perpetuate tbe party

name and incidentally oppose the selec
tion ot any nominee for the Presidency
except one of their own number. They ao
not object to Bryan on personal grounds.
They say he is "good enough Populist for
us, but we have equally acceptable men in
our ranks." Perhaps when Senator Jones
of Arkansas arrives he may be sufficiently
influential with the leaders to bring them
into line, but it is doubtful.
General Weaver of lowa believes the
nomination of Bryan the eminently
proper course for the convention to follow.
He believes it would unite the party to
give the voters something to work for, be
cause bis nomination by both parties
would make his election a certainty. He
would also include Sewall in the nomina
tion. He says there would be no incon
sistency in a Populist support of Sewall,
who has been a greenback Democrat
always. It is his belief that the Populists
will vote for Bryan, whether they nom
inate him or not. In his opinion Bryan
will not only be elscted, but he will carry
lowa by a handsome plurality.
The contention of Mr. Taubeneck, chair
man of the National Committee, that
Bryan should not be nominated, is in
dorsed by some of the ablest men in the
party, who feel that such a course would
be suicidal. These say that the nomina
tion of Bryan is dictated largely by selfish
considerations; by men who hope to se
cure local preferment through the success
of the National ticket. "General" J. S.
Coxey, of Commonwealer fame, is another
of the conspicuous Populists who cannot
be convinced that Bryan's nomination by
the party would be for the best interest.
Coxey has no candidate, but he does not
want Bryan to secure the nomination.
It is a curious fact that some of the
Southern Populists have been converted
from free traders to extreme protectionists
through their affiliations of late years with
the Republicans. While some of these
men place silver above the tariff as a Na
tional issue, ttere are others who are un
willing to give their support to a tariff
reformer, but say that as between the two
they would prefer McKinley. Generally
speaking, however, the delegates care
nothing for the tariff. With them the all
absorbing question is more moneyâ more
silver money. To secure this they will
make any sacrifice and go to any extreme
to defeat McKinley and his hated "gold
bug" friends,
The Sabbath brought in but few arrivals
of delegates to the convention, and fewer
of any note. Principal among them were
Reuben F. Koib, the Populist candidate
for Governor of Alabama; J. S. Coxey of
Massillon, Ohio, famous for his "army"
that marched to Washington ia 1894.
Senator Jones of Arkansas, chairman of
the National Democratic Committee, was
expected to spend the day here, en route
from Washington, and confer with Gov
ernor Stone, but he will not arrive until
to-morrow.
The published call for a meeting at tbe
Lrndell this afternoon in behalf of the
"middle of the road" policy drew quite a
crowd of people, but Chairman Taube
neck, by whose authority the announce
ment was supposed to have been made,
stated that it had never been tbe intention
to hold such a meeting, so far as be knew.
At the "middle of tbe road" headquarters
in the Laclede, however, a continuous
meeting went on all day and far into the
night. Here was afforded an opportunity
for many who wanted to talk to express
their views on the questions for which the
Populist party stands. It was an, open
game, and the speakers were often com
pelled to answer or "fence" questions
more or less disconcerting. The topics
discussed were the money question, direct
legislation, Government ownership of the
railroads, telegraphs and telephones; re
striction of the National banking methods
and the advocacy of the direct issue of
money to the people.
There are contests from but two
States to engage the attention of
the Populist National Committee and
Convention â Illinois and Colorado.
That from the first-named State involves
the seats of twenty-seven delegates from
Cook Countyâ Chicago. The leaders are
Dr. Howard Taylor and Seymour S. Stead
man, and the contest between them is
said to be very bitter. The Taylor delega
tion claims to be indorsed by the State
committee. One of the delegates is F.
B. Cantwell, leader in the Commonweal
Army, starting from Tacoma, Wash. At
one time, it is said, Cantwell had 3,000
men in his party. In making the trans
continental tour they captured fourteen
trains and several times were under ar
rest. Tbe Steadman faction has prepared
a series of questions, among which is one
asking by whose authority the National
committeeman has said the convention
would indorse Mr. Bryan or any other
man.
The Colorado contest promises to de
velop into something interesting on the
floor of the convention. R. A. South
worth, chairman of what is known as the
Waite delegation, says of the contest:
"I come irom a very large State and the
railway fares range from 4 cents to 6 cents,
with a maximum of 10 cents in tbe moun
tain districts. The only paper in Colo
rado claiming to be a Populist publica
tion is the Rocky Mountain News and it
was in this that the call for our State
Convention made its appearance, signed
by the chairman of the State Central Com
mittee. Many of our people did not see
the notice and many were too poor to pay
the exorbitant railway fares charged.
Those who did come to the packed con
vention came on passes. Governor Waite
announced that an appeal would be taken
from the decision to the St. Louis Conven
tion. He farther said that a mass-meet
ing of delegates would at once be held in
Plumbers' Hall. Seventeen counties fol
lowed Mr. Waite from tbe hall and a mass
convention was held and delegates were
chosen. Many of the delegates selected
were not present at the meeting and when
we notified them of their selection all but
one of the forty-five bade us godspeed in
our work. Waite was first chosen chair
man of the delegation, but he was re
moved last Monday and I was placed in
his place because he indorsed Bryan."
Thomas W. Patterson is at the head of
tbe other set of delegates from Colorado,
which Mr. Southworth says is composed
of Democrats and Populists.
W. H. Gilstrap of Visalia, Cal., tbe only
Populist delegate in the city from that
State, ia editor of the Tulare County News
and the Tulare Valley Citizen, both publi
cations beine pioneer champions of the
doctrines of Populism. He said: "Cali
fornia will be unanimous for a 'middle-of
the-road* policy. The watchword of the
party in our State is 'Not to become the
side show of the Democratic circus.' "
J. 8. Osborne and R. J. Sledge, Texas
delegates, declared if a straight Populist
ticket and platform are put out Bryan and
Sewail will not be able to carry Texas.

BT. LOUIS, Mo., July laâ Ever since

their demands that he become the Demo

Rev. Mr. Williams Prais>s the Purity
cf Life of the Young
Candidate*.
LINCOLN, Nebr., July 19.â The life of a
candidate for the Presidency did not have
so rosy a tinge to Mr, Bryan to-day. HÂ«
has a wonderful capacity for hard work,
but a man even of his strength would be
appalled at the piospectof wadine through
the thousands of letters and teleerams
whicto litter the oak desk in his library.
It was 6 o'clock this evening before Mr.
Bryan, with the assistance of Mrs. Bryan
and W. F. Schwind, who are acting as
secretaries to the nominee, had opened
and sorted yesterday's mail, and then
they sighed as they looked at the big
bundle of mail matter that came from the
postoffice to-day.
Mr. and Mrs. Bryan attended services at
the First Presbyterian Cnurch this morn
ing and listened to a sermon by a young
minister eulogistic of the Democratic
nominee. T'lis is the church in which
Mr. Bryan teaches a bible class, but he
omitted his duties in that connection to
day. There was no unusual number of
people present. After the services were
over Mr. Bryan shook hands with a num
ber of the congregation and was then
driven to his home and began work on
the accumulated mail matter. r
People of all sorts and conditions are
writine to Mr. Bryan. Casters of horo
scopes have sent him their occult calcula
tions as to his career, and a gentleman
calling himself the "Columbian Wizard"
has given a particularly rosy tinge to his
predictions, coupled with much sage ad
vice as to the best manner of offsetting
Republican effort in Illinois and other
States. A man in New York wrote on a
linen cuff, which a 2-cent stamp carried
through the mails. He said he was too
poor to buy writing paper. According tc
the story told by the correspondence, the
makers of Bryan cigars and Bryan whisky
are legion, and each and every one of
them is anxious for the candidate to try
his wares. It may be said in this connec
tion vhat Mr. Bryan neither drinks
spirituous liquors nor smokes tobacco in
any form.
Little present* from enterprising mer
chants are also being delivered at the
Bryan residence. Mr. Bryan authorizes
the statement that he dees not desire any
gifts, and in order to discourage the send
ing he has decided not to acknowledge
their receipt.
Manufacturers of campaign buttons are
showing an intense rivalry, each trying to
secure his sanction of a particular device,
but Mr. Bryan has refused to recommend
any particular style. New-found relatives
of the candidate are springing up all over
the country. One of these is his great
grandmother on the Bryan side, bat as
his father's mother died some sixty years
ago the claim of the aged lady to even
more ancient relationship is somewhat
doubtful.
The Bryan residence, No. 1625 D street,
is still decorated with the starred and
striped bunting placed there by neighbors
before the return of the nominee to Lin
coln. The gay coloring makes the home
of Mr. Bryan conspicuous and strangers
have no difficulty in locating it.
Ruth, William and Grace Bryan, the
children of the candidate, do not seem to
be much impressed with the important
position now occupied by their father and
conducted themselves to-day just as here
tofore. Miss Ruth spent most of the after
noon riding a new bicycle. She informed
a visitor to-day that she was sure her
father would carry D street and the Fifth
Ward of Lincoln, but as to the general re
sult she preferred to hold her opinion in
abeyance until after November 3. And
this from a youngster of 11 years!
Some neighbors and friends dropped in
on Mr. and Mrs. Bryan during the day,
but most of their acquaintances knew the
nominee and his wife were busy and kept
away.
The sermon at the First Presbyterian
Church this morning was preached by
Key. W. K. Williams, pastor of the Bethel
Methodist Episcopal Church. He was
very earnest in his remarks, and that part
of them relating directly to Mr. Bryan
were listened to attentively by the latter.
In the course of his sermon Mr. Williams
said:
We are told in the twenty -stxtn verse, twelfth
chapter of the First Corinthians that if one
member suffers, all the members suffer with
it, and that if one member is honored, all the
members rejoice.
One of your members has been highly hon
ored by the people â he has been honored by
God â and I rejoice that a iellow-cltizen and a
member In Christ has been thus highly hon
ored. I also rejoice In the purity of his life, in
the nobility of his thought, in the vigor of his
young manhood, in tha majesty and grandeur
of hit impassioned eloquence and in the fear
less manner with which he proclaims to the
world tne principles that lie deep within his
heart. I shall continue to pray that God will
keep him pure and make him a yet mightier
force for good in this Nation, and that Christ
shall be his leader always.
Looking upon his splendid abilities I am
constrained to ask the scriptural question,
"Who maketh thee to differ from another?"
and the answer comes from the word of God,
"Every good and perfect gift cometh down
from above."
This Nation was born in a straggle for lib
erty, and God is the author of liberty. It was
cradled in Independence and was nourished
upon the principle of equal rights lor aIL By
faith in God this Nation should go forth, con
quering and to conquer, until it shall break
down every form of tyrannical government
and until it shall destroy the power of monop
olies and lift the burdens from tbe backs of
the people.
It has been practically decided that
Democratic campaign headquarters shall
be estaoiished in Chicago. As previously
stated in these dispatches, Mr. Bryan will
have Kb personal headquarters here. To
morrow he will occupy the apartments re
served for his use at the Lincoln Hotel
and will receive visitors there.
Mr. Schwind, who is Mr. Bryan's pri
vate secretary, studied law in the nomi
nee's office. He is a Lincoln man and in
terested in politics.
BRYAN FORCES MEET.
Sixty Delegates Mustered at a Con
ference In the Nebraskan's
Behalf.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., July 19.â An impetus
was given to the Bryan boom to-night at a
meeting held at the Lindell Hotel. About
sixty delegates were present. The pur
pose of the meeting was to consolidate the
Bryan men in tbe different delegations.
Some speakers showed that the sentiment
for Bryan among their colleagues was een
erally favorable, while the delegates from
Kansas, Oklahoma, Maryland, Pennsyl
vania. Nevada and the District of Colum
bia asserted that their delegations would
vote as a unit for the Democratic candi
date. Another meeting will De held at 9
o'clock to-morrow morning, at which a
definite programme will be agreed upon.
To-night's meeting was presided over by
General Weaver of lowa. H. W. Yonge of
Kansas was secretary and the assistant
secretaries were Messrs. F. L. Bailey of
Oklahoma and Beaton Maret of Nebraska.
Senator Peffer and ex-Governor Lewelling
of Kansas were among those present. Mr. '
Bailey, who is an ardent Bryan man, in
formed the United Press reporter subse
quently that the reports made this even
ing indicated Bryan's nomination by the
convention beyond a peradventure.
BRYAN MEN LOSE HOPE,
Continued from JFtrsl rage.
pink face and snow-white whiskers and
eyebrows, was Senator Stewart of Nevada,
who is here superintending an army of
silver spieiers.
The latest accession to the ranks of the
trimmers is James B. Weaver of lowa,
who ran as a candidate for the Presidency
on the Greenback ticket and, afterward,
for the same position at the head of the
People's party ticket. He told me with
an almost ludicrous unconsciousness of
the inconsistency that he was in favor of
the indorsement of Bryan and Sewall. It
Is likely that before this convention is
ended General Weaver will be placed in
the middle of the road in a snowstorm by
the indignant Populists.
To-day being Sunday, many of the dele
gates were away from headquarters, rid
ing down the Mississippi <>n steamboats
or quaffing beer in the suburban gardens,
so that the silver spielers nad not very
much material upon which to wag their
jaws. There was a pretty large crowd at
the Laclede Hotel, at the headquarters of j
the middle-of-the-road Populists, and sev- !
eral unlucky spielers who had gone thither
under the impression that these people
had wheels in their heads found to their
chagrin, after a bard and disastrous bat- I
tie, that those particular kind of wheels 1
were made to turn only one way, and that j
they were not built with an eye to reverse
movement.
Southern chivalry declared itself to-day
in its usually picturesque manner. A
gentlemaD had escorted a woman reporter
and her companionâ an Oakland. Cal.,
girl of French parentageâ to the Lindell I
Hotel to introduce them to Senator Peffer !
and a few of the ex-Governors of the ;
Southern States now here in attendance I
on the Populist Convention. The French '
girl is a contralto singer in the operatic I
troupe playing in "Ãbrig's Cave," is 20 j
yearÃ of age and is as pretty as a Delaware '
peach, with ripe red lips, a complexion of i
pearl and large black eyes of the melting
kind. Four ex-Governors from Alabama,
Georgia, Mississippi and South Carolina
were introduced to the ladies and gal- 'â 
lantly invited them, should ever they hap- j
pen to be within a hundred miles of the j
ex-Governors' residences, to pay them a j
visit and partake of the generous and re
fined hospitality for which the people of
the South are distinguished.
After the ladies had boarded the street
car for home, the person who had escorted
them was surrounded by a delegation of i
gallant Southern gentlemen, wbo were
loud in their praise of the beauty of the
dark-eyed lady reporter. On being in
formed that the young lady was not a re
porter but an opera singer, the ex-Gov
ernors exhibited the greatest curiosity to
learn where she was singing. To-night
the audience at Uhrig'sCave was increased
by eighteen Populist delegates from the
sunny South, and among them were four
ex-Governors. When the young lady ap
peared upon the stage she was greeted
with four magnificent bouquets and an
outburst of applause so prolonged that the
managers instantly increased her salary
$10 a week.
Straight Populists are indignant over
the false reports sent from here by Demo
cratic newspapers and newspaper corre
spondents to the effect that Bryan will be
indorsed. The St. .Louis Republic, a Dem
ocratic paper, nas been saying every d*y
that Populist leaders have been declaring
for Bryan, while the fact has been that
they were opposed to him.
A careful canvass made to-night at the
middle-of-the-road headquarters by R. A.
Southworth, chairman of the middle-of
the-road delegation from Colorado, and by
J. H. Gilstrap of California, shows that
the entire South, together with California,
Texas and Wyoming, are solidly opposed
to indorsing Bryan or any other man. and
are in favor of putting up a straight Popu
list ticket
"It will not be heaithy for any Southern
delegate to vote for fusion and then go
home; he would better stay up North,"
remarked Mr. Southworth dryly.
The candidates mentioned for the Presi
dential nomination on the Populist ticket
are : President V*ndervoort of the Indus
trial Legion of Nebraska, Senator Peffer
of Kansas, and Daniel Page, the head of
the Farmers' Alliance of Virginia. Con
gressman Towne. a silver bolter from the
Republican National convention, ia also
mentioned, bat the straight Populists
think that there are enough able men in
the Darty to fill all places on tne ticket.
The fact that Senator Btewart is losing
his temper is looked upon as an indication
that bs is not making any headway. He
remarked to-night. "Middle-of-the-road
Popuftet â middle of ." When men
who look like Santa Claus begin swearing

MOVEMENTS OF THE KAISER.
Germany's Proposed Participation in
the Paris Exposition Causes Much
Comment.
BERLIN, Germany, July 19.â Prince
Hohenlohe, Chancellor of the German em
pire, who is spending his holiday at his
schloss in Alt-Aussee, Austria, lefc for
Ischl, for the purpose of paying a visit to
Emperor Francis Joseph of Austria. The
Chancellor and the Emperor had a pro
tracted interview, which was not shared
by any member of the Austrian Ministry.
After their exchange of views they dined
together, and Prince Hoher.loue returned
to Alt-Aussee on Wednesday. Since the
interview at Ischl ii has transpired that
communications have been exchanged be
tween the Governments at Vienna and
Rome in regard to a meeting between Em
peror Francis Joseph and King Humbert,
to take place in the autumn, after the
former receives Emperor William at
Goedoeloe.
Naturally the influence of the recent
chance) in the I:alian Ministry will be
associated with these interviews. The
French view of the situation â that the
Marquis Yisconti-Venosta, the new Italian
Minister of Foreign Affairs, is less favor
able to a continuance of the Dreibund
than was his predecessor in office, the
Duke of Sermoneta, and also that the
policy of Signor Luzzati, the new Italian
Minister of the Treasury, will include a
commercial treaty with Franceâ does not
coincide with the official opinion here,
which is based upon advices from Rome.
According to these advices instead of
tending to opposition to the triple alliance
the newly constructed ministry of the
Marquis de Rudini is stronger in favor of
the Dreibund than was the former min
istry. â¢
Although the Marquis Visconti-Venosta
quitted the office of Minister of Foreign
Affairs in 1877, prior to Italy's joining the
Dreibund, be was really the inspirer of the
Dreibund. It was under the influence of
his prompting that King Victor Emman
uel visited Berlin and Vienna in 1874,
when the Dreibund was discussed. King
Humbert has always held steadfast to bis
allies, and certainly would not now accept
a ministry whose views in regard to the
continuance of the alliance were doubtful.
The King saw Visconti-Venosta on Thurs
day ana afterward started for Monsta,
having received the assurance of the Min
ister that the foreign policy of Italy re
mained undisturbed.
In regard to the policy of Sienor Luz
zati, the German Government desires to
see the establishment of a commercial
rapprochement between Italy and France,
upon the ground that, the military pact
between Germany and Italy being secure,
whatever would assist the nrosperity of
Italy and strengthen an ally to bear her
military burdens would be eminently de
sirable to Germany.
Although Signor Luzzati takes office
pledged to provide a full military budget
there is a reason to state that communica
tions are proceeding between the Govern
ments at Rome, Vienna and Berlin in re
gard to the Italian military economics, in
which the Dreibund powers are interested,
and it is very probable that the projected
interviews between the monarchs will
have reference thereto. The Government
in Berlin is absolutely satisfied with the
new Rudini ministry.
The Emperor is spending most of his
time on a tour of the northern waters in
j the Bingin fiords. His Majesty has ex
j perienced much bad weather thus far on
I ii is trip, tuere having been unceasing
I downpours of rain for days at a time.
| Latterly the skies have become brighter.
While the imperial yacht Hohenzollern
lay wrapped in the rain mists the Kaiser
has been accustomed to take long walks
on shore, accompanied by Count Pnilip
Eulenberg, German Embassador to Aus
tria, and others of his suite, the Emperor
outpacing all the rest. The evenings on
board the yacht have been spent in the
performance of short comedy pieces, with
concerts and readings. The Emperor's
business has been chiefly conducted in the
morning hours. Wire connections with
tbo Continent have been maintained
throughout the cruise, and by this means
the Emperor was enabled to send con
gratulations to President Faure upon the
latter's escape from the bullet of an as
sassin a very short time after the shot was
fired on the Long Champs reviewing
ground.
It is now fixed that the Kaiser will re
turn to Wilhelmshaven on August 5, when
with the Empress he will start for Wesel
to unveil a statue of Emperor William I
at that place on August 6. From Wesel
the Kaiser and Kaiserin will visit Essen
as the guests of Krupp, the great German
gunmaker, for which visit great prepara
tions are being made by the Krupps and
the local authorities. After his entertain
ment at Essen the Emperor will join his
family at Wilhelmshoe, and on August 9
he will go to Baden to attend a grand
function upon the occasion of the seven
tieth birtuday of the Grand Duke of
Baden.
A report of doubtful authenticity has
been in circulation that the heads of the
federal states have given their assent to
the Emperor to ask the Grand Duke of
Baden to assume the title of king, with a
union of the Grand Duchy of Baden and
the fleici'Sland. When the question of
linkine the Grand Duchy of Baden with
the. Reichsland was seriously discussed
some years ago the beads of the federal
states were unanimous in declaring
against the proposal.
The seasons at most of the summer re
sorts are in full blast and some of the re
sorts are beginning to be crowded. Kis
singen, where the Duke of Saxe-Ct>bur<*
and several German state officials have
arrived, is not yet full, however, and the
season at Horn burg will not begin to open
until the middle of August, when the
Prince of Wales will arrive, which event
will bring with it a host of Americans.
Carlsbad is already crowded. Among the
sojourners there are the Princess Clemen
tine of Saxe-Coburg, mother of Prince Fer
dinand of Bulgaria; Prince Ferdinand of
Bulgaria, ex-king Milan of Servia, Duke
Siegfried of Bavaria, Prince Dolgourokoff
and Colonel William Jay and family of
Newport, and a large number of other
Americans.
The acceptance of Germany of Â»n invi
tation to be represented at the Paris exhi
bition in 1900 is variously commented on
by the Berlin and provincial German
press.
The Tagblatt, in its article upon the
subject, thinks that it indicates the surety
of peace for many years to come and a
prospect of the ultimate reconciliation of
Germany and France.
The Hamburg Correspondenz says that
although exhibitors are fatigued with ex
hibitions, particularly after their exoeri
ence at the World's Fair in Chicago, it is
an act of political courtesy and would tes
tify to the friendly disposition or Germany
toward France if Germany would take a
large part in the exhibition. #
The Hamburger Nachrichten, in an ar
ticle written in a thoroughly BismarcKian.
vein, refers to Germany's taking part in
the exhibition as necessary. Germans,
the paper says, should certainly do so un
less their own interests are to be neglected.
"Nobody," it adds, "can even remotely
foretell what may happen to France be
fore 1900. German people ought not to
show a disposition to cultivate the French.
It is a tentiment thrown away, is received
with scant courtesy and does not abate the
vehemence of their desire for revenge. It
is best to trust to impressing France by
the strength of our army and the growing
numoer and dominance of the German
people, wbo must keep in mind the fact
that France will not hesitate to spring at
their throats the moment she thinks she
has a chance to win."

OPPOSED TO POPULISM.
Bryan Not In Accord With tha
Principles of the Third
Party.
TOPE&A, Katjs., July 19.â E. G. Wilson
of this city, and a personal friend of Wil
liam J. Bryan, the Democratic nominee for
President, has in his possession a letter in
which Mr. Bryan declares that be cannot
approve some of the People's- party prin
ciples. The letter was written in reply to
one sent to Mr. Bryan by Mr. Wilson
shortly after Mr. Bryan delivered his
famous speech in Congress on free silver,
when he was thought to have left
the Democratic party. Mr. Wilson
congratulated him on his speech, but
advised him to be sure to keep out of the
People's party. To this Mr. Bryan re
plied as follows:
House or Representatives, 1
Washington, D. C, Oct. 26, 1893. J
E. O. Wilson, Topckaâl&Y Dear Wilson: I
thank you for the suggestions contained In
your letter. I have not left the Democratic
party,' bat am ready to do so as soon as I am
satisfied that it, as a party, is wedded to the
gold standard. Until that time it is not neces
sary to discuss the merits or demerits of the
Populists. There are some things in their
platform, however, which I do not and will
not favor, but the Populists at their worst are
not as dangerous to the Government as the
plutocratic wing of both old parties. The
Democratic party has always represented
those who believe in popular government and
in bringing that government as near as possi
ble to the people. If the Democratic party de
serts its principles the losses will go to the in
dependent party and moderate their ideas and
make them a power for good. Thanking you
for the friendly interest which you manifest, I
am very truly yours, W.J.Bryan.
Conference of Silver Bolters.
MANITOU, Col.. July 19.â The confer
ence of Western Senators and Representa

tion continued during the day, and at
evening the statement was given out that
the address to tbe public will not be issued
before to-morrow evening. Senator Petti
grew is out of the deal, as he has elected
to join the Populist party. It developed
that differences of opinion prevented an
early agreement on the form and language
of the address, and several drafts were
made only to be destroyed. Senator Can
non was not present, being detained in
Boston by illness of a relative. Senator
Mantle arrived to-day and joined tbe con
ference. The address will ba issued to the
press associations from Denver.

Gold Men Will "Unite Upon Ex- Governor
9 Me Or aw. '
PORTLAND, Ob., July 19.â Melvin G.
Winstock, a prominent Seattle lawyer
politician, said to-day:
"We intend to elect John H. McGraw,
a gold-standard man, to the Senate this
fall. This will, however, not be accom
plished without . the most momentous
struggle in our political history. ~ A num
ber of men who have always been more
devoted to the pursuit of office than to the
advocacy of principles calculated to pro
mote the country's best good have bolted,
the party. The worship of the 'silver calf
has turned many a head, but we depend
on the people's strong common sense and
native wit to win our victory. Each man
has resolved to do personal work in the
campaign, which is already on, and we
don't intend to be defeated.
"There is strong talk among Senator
Squire's friends that he will shortly arrive
in Seattle and will announce his union
with the ex-Republicans east of the moun
tains who have declared for Bryan and
silver. The McGraw men desire nothing
better than this. It will simplify the issue
in King County. The McGraw Senatorial
Club has now 1600 members, most of whom
reside in King County." .

BAYRETTH. Bavaria. July 19.â There
was a large assemblage, including many
Americans, present to-day at the Fest
spielhaus to witness the production of
'R'leingold" in the first cycle of Wagner's
tetralogy, "Der Ring dcs Nibehinren,"
given under the ausDices of Prince Regent
Luitpold of Bavaria. There was also a
large crowd on the hill on which the Fest
spielhauu is located. The cast was as
follows :
Wotanâ Carl Perron, Dresden.
Frickaâ Mrtdaine Mane Brema, London.
I'ryiiâ Frnuleiu Marioti Weed, Berlin.
Krdaâ Fran Heink-Schumann, Hamburg.
T.ogeâ Heinrich Vogel, Munich.
Prohâ -Alois BurKstaller, Bayreuth.
Donnerâ Hermann Baehmann, Number*.
Fasnerâ Johannes Eimblud, Breslau.

Alberichâ Friedrioh Fricdrk'hs, Bremen.
WcMguneâ Fraulein Katharina Rosin, Chem
nitz.
â \VÂ«>glinde â Frauiein Josephine yon Artner,
Hamburg.
Flosshildeâ Fraulein Olive Fremstad, Co
logne.
The parts of Loge, Fasolt, Erda, Frya
an.i Mime jvere presented in an excellent
manner. Perron as Wotan, Friedrichs as
Aiberich and Klrnblad as Fafner produced
only a moderately favorable impression,
whiie the representation of the Rhine
Daughters wa< bud. The work of the
orchestra under the direction of Dr. Hans
Kichter of Vienna was admirable. The
scenery was good, but it often did not ac
cord with the Wapner tradition.
When th curiain arose the audience be-
gan to discern in the dimness of the scene
the representation of the deep waters of
the Rnine moving slowly. The music,
with its deep, slumberous sound, wafted
the audience from the noise and turmoil
outside and a feeling of complete rest
came over the listeners.
By degrees ther* can be seen three
figures moving to and fro in the dimness
of the water. They are those of the
Khine daughter*, Wellgunde, FJosshilde
and "Woglince. They; swim around a rock
in the center of the Rhine stream.
Lower down can be seen a hideoas-look
inc dwarf who, creeping from a cavern in
the bottom of the Rhine, watches the play
of the maidens. This hideous, ugly dwarf
is Alberich, king of the Nibelungs. The
Nibelungs are beings who live in dark
caverns underground.
Alberich begins to court the Rhine
nja : dens and in the course of their con
ion it is learned that .the three
maidens are there to j:uard the Rhinegold,
a magnificent treasure with powerful
rnvstic nroperties.
Tins Riiinegold suddenly begins to shine
on Che top of the rock around which the
maidens are swimming and sinking the
ji raise of th â  mar~eious treasure. Alberich,
who has been fooled by the Rhine daugh
ters, and bis pleadings ior love having
been scuffed at by them asks the maidens
what the gold is good for.
They tell him the world's wealth is to
be won by him who from the Rhinegold
blfculd hammer a ring which would be
stow measureless might. AVoghnde tells
Alberich farther that none but he who
"from the delights or love withholds, who
for its inutn has heed no more," alone can
reach th?; wonder which rounds the gold
to a ring.
These guardians of the Rhinegold are
in no fear of Albericti, for he bes shown
them that he is an ardent courtier; there
fore he is no fit person to secure the gold.
But the experiences Alberich has made
With these i^u-hters of the Rhine have
worked a revolution within him.
no longer is in love; he becomes
greedy of the power that is connected with
the- possession of the gold. As he cannot
have love he decides to have power. And
be calculates, in possession of power and
gold: "And forced I not love, yet de-
L^hts, at least, I minht filch."
Therefore with extreme determination
he climb- up the rock from which the gold
sends its rays, calls the waters to witness
that he renounces and curses love, clutches
the cold to gain the ring and plunges
headlong with it into the depths, where he
swiftly disappears.
The Rhine daughters dart straight after
the thief, screaming for help. Complete
dariness sets in, the floods fall and
one hears from afar the yelling
laughter of Alberich. As the waves dis-
R| poar clouds arise, and finally one dis
covers through a thin mist a beautiful
piece of open country on mountain
heights.
The breaking day lightens with growing
brightness a castle with snining battle
ments standing upon a rock in tiie back
ground. Between ibis castle on the rock
and the foreground of the scene it is sup
posed lies a deep valley with the Rhine
flowing through it.
At the side, on flower-radiant ground,
reposes Wottw, the god cf gods, me
Fncka, his consort, beside him. Both are
a.-ieep. Wotan yearns to possess the
ureless miglit which would fail to
b m who hammers the Rhinegold to a
ring.
As he is an unfit person to achieve this
aim and end, because he will not forego
love, he strikes a bargain with the giants
Fasolt and Fafner to build him a castle on
a lofty height as a mark of his supreme
power.
f This castle Wotan calls Valhall. As
payment, Wotan was induced by the half
t?nd Loge to pledge to the giants the fair
Goddess Frya; but when the castle it com
pleted tie tries to withdraw from the bar
gained payment. Luge then tells him that
Alberich already has the tnyz, and the
giants demand that. As a pledge they
carry away the Goddess Frya.
Wotan and Loge then go to the under
ground realms, where by cunning they in
duce Alberich to exert the magic be has
acquired and turn himself into a toad.
This done, they seenre him and the ring
and carry both to the upper region. There
they set Alberich free, jvhen with intense
ratio he curses the ring, declaring that it
shall brintr death to any one wiio wears it,
until it comes back to bin:.
lie then disappears; the two giants fight
to i he (ieaih for the possession of the ring.
After returning Frya Fasolt is killed and
the other giant walks off with the ring
aud all the treasures.
The opera theu draws to a conclusion
with most beautiful music. Dormer, the
Thunderer, stretches a rainbow as a bridge
across the valley to the castle and all the
gods and goddesses step over it to Valhall.
The curtain falls while the mournful la
ment of the Rhine daughters is heard from
the river.
PANIC IN A. CRETAN TOWN.

NEW YORK, N. V., July 20.â A special

says: Dispatches received from Canea
state that a panic occurred there at 10
o'clock yesterday morning in the Plantza
quarter, owing to a fire, which was mis
taken as a signal for carnage. The houses
were forthwith barricaded. British Cap
tain Drury promptly landed boats, carry
ing armed sailors and the Austrian and
Russian ships also landed men in Canea

The Austrian Consul showed great
courage and ran to Abdullah Pasha, who
seemed inactive, and berated him severely.
Abdullah Pasha finally dispersed the
Turks. The shops were closed and no
body dared stay in the streets. The cor
respondent says that as he passed through
the town the dead and wounded were
lying about and the panic still continued.

SPOKANE FALLS. Wash.. July 19.â
The sun is hidden from view at this point,
caused by the fierce forest fires that are
raging in the mountains near here. The
smotce is getting heavier every day and
the sun looks like a red ball of fire. Re
ports coming in from outside places in the
mountains say that miners and prospec
tors are coming down into the valleys,
some of them having lost everything.
W. F. Kohlhauff and FrankChilds, just
returned from the north fork of the Sal
mon River in British Columbia, say that
the fires have gained great headway there.
They had been working at Arnold mine,
but the fire came down ao fast that they
barely escaped with their lives. The camp
with the shafthouse and tools was burned.
The fire has not yet penetrated the thick
underbrush along the creek, but has been
confined to the top of the mountains.
Reports from all mining camps to the
north are to the same effect. Around
Kaslo, Slocan and Sandan miners have
been compelled to flee for life, as the fire
comes on so rapidly. Around Rossland
it is still high on the mountains, but is
creeping down. The flames have gained
such headway that any attempt to stop
them are useless and fruitless. As there
is heavy timber around Rossland and the
trail has been all cut away there is little
danger of these towns being burned, but
several large mining plants near the
former place and a big smelter at the
latter are in danger. Large crews of men
have been put to work to prevent fire get
ting to them. Trains in that section have
great trouble in running on account of the
fires along the road and the falling of
burned trees across the track.
Calispell mountains, a ' short distance
from Spokane, are on fire. At night in
the neighborhood the light penetrates the
dense smoke and makes a beautiful pic
ture, while the roar of the fire and crack
ling of falling trees adds grandeur to the
scene. The fire on these mountains is
fast creeping down to the valley, and
ranchers are in alarm.
In the Coeur d'Alene mountains there is
some fire, but as this section has been
swept a number of times tl>e underbrush
has been. burned away and fires are not so
easily started there.
On the Colville reservation fires are said
to be raging terribly. Prospectors just in
from that section say that the damage to
timber will amount Wo millions of dollars.
A great many prospectors will lose all
they had. and those who are coming in
consider themselves lucky to get out with
their lives. The fires will not abate until
there is rain, while smoke increases in
density every day here. Loss to life and
property will be heavy.

SEATTLE, Wash., July 19.â Telegraph

is kept busy on each transcontinental
line, as well as the Seattle, Lake Shore and
Eastern, and the Great Northern coast
branches. Bicyclists traveling north on
the coast lines on Saturday say the tire
raged with such fury in proximity to the
tracks that the heat became almost un
bearable.
Owing to the unusual dryness, becaus â 
of a scarcity of rain this season, the fireti
are doing greater damage than heretofore,
SONOMA VALLEY'S UNION HIGH SCHOOL.
6OISOMA, Cal., July 19.â The board of trustees of the Sonoma Valley Union High
School has finally determined uoon the purchase of the old Cumberland College
building on Broadway. The building, though old, is one of the handsomest and most
imposing in the valley. It was built by the Cumberland Presbyterian Church, which
was at one time quite powerful in this Slate. Under the management of Rev. W. M.
Cunningham the institution for a long time enjoyed a very high reputation as one of
the most thorough educational institutions of California. The building has been un
occupied for some years, but is in a fair state of preservation. A few repairs will make
it a most desirable home for the high school.
and there is no probability that they will
soon be extinguished, save through the
intervention of showers.

now threatens to destroy the villages of
Niagara and Halstead. They say several
unused cabins and the Niagara logging
camp are burned. The fire has thus far
burned very little in the green timber and
the damage has not been great, but it
threatens to destroy much valuable tim

have begun unusually early this year and
there is no question about their spreading

LOS ANGELES' BENEFIT,
Equal Suffragists Extend Aid
to Miss Couzins in Her
Distress.
Leaders in the Eleventb-Amendment
Crusade Address a Large
Gathering.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., July 19.â The
benefit given in Unity Church to MiÂ«s
Phoebe Couzins, the woman suffragist and
lecturer, was well ' attended to-night. A
goodly sum was collected and will be ten
dered to her tomorrow.
Miss Couzins has been bedridden for
several months with rheumatism, and as
a result her exchequer became exhausted.
She applied to the Woman Suffrage Asso
ciation of Los Angeles County for assist
ance to reach her brother in Missouri. The
benefit to-night was the result.
Mrs. Mila Tupper Maynard, president of
the. Suffrage Association, presided and
read a letter of regret from Miss Couzins,
who was too ill to be present. After a se
lection by the Women's Orchestra Rev.
Anna Shaw was introduced.
She paid a high tribute to Miss Couzins,
I who had done so much for the cause and
j would doubtless have continued an earn
est worker had she retained her health.
Miss Shaw proceeded to discuss what it
|isto be a Christian. She referred to the
| fact that there was no doubt as to this be
i ing a Christian people, for the Supreme
I court bad been appealed to and had so de
cided. This bit of sarcasm caused a slight
ripple of lauphter.
â¢ The speaker referred to woman's long
iiuht for the right of conscience â to follow
the path of duty as dictated by her own
conscience. *
She denied that women were contented
to occupy a subordinate and inferior po
sition, and said that even if this was so it
was because woman had been robbed by
man of her love of liberty. . .
Rev. John A. B. Wilson of the First
Methodist Episcopal Church followed with

MRS. MITCHELLE'S RETORT.
An*u>ers Truntee Patterson's Erplana
tinn of thr Whittier School Trouble.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., July 19.â Public
interest in the affairs ot the Whittier Re
form School is being intensified day by
day. The publication in The Call of a
portion of the testimony taken recently
by Trustees Patterson and Mitchell, relat
ing to the punishment of inmates, has
called forth considerable comment from
leading citizens, much of which has been
anything but complimentary to the man
agement of the institution.
Trustee Patterson had a long explana
tion in the morning papers to-day, in
which he indorsed the alleged acts of
cruelty as necessary discipline. He at
tributed various and sinister motives to
"the Mitchells" for having instigated the
investigation. A correspondent saw
Trustee Adina Mitchell after she had read
Trustee Patterson's card to the public, and
asked her for a statement regarding it.
She said:
"And so Mr. Patterson has taken b col
umn and a half of valuable space for his
repeatedly threatened explanation, and
after all it is an explanation which does
not explain. By this onslaught upon 'the
Mitchells', the gentleman evidently be
lieves that he can draw me into a contro
versy with himself in order that the pub
lic mind may be distracted from Whittier.
Not at alll As I have before remarked, I
must decline to encage in a personal con
troversy with Trustee Patterson or any
one else, whereby the public mind may be
diverted from the cruelties practiced in
the State school at Whittier, which should
be in fact, as well as in name, a reform
school. That is all."
INVESTS IN THE
OREGON RAILWAY,
Huntington Believed to
Have Purchased an
Interest.
TARIFFS ARE RAISED.
The Southern Pacific Buys the
Power to End a War of
Rates.
NOBTHEBN COMPETITION ENDS.
Rumors That the California Corpora
tion Is Now in Control of the
Line.
PORTLAND, Or., July 19.â A rumor is
current here in railroad circles that Collis
P. Huntington and the Southern Pacific
people have a hand in the new govern
ment of the Oregon Railway and Naviga
tion Company, which will on August 1
be transferred from the jurisdiction of the
Federal courts, where it has been involved
in litigation so lonj:, the receiver dis
charged and the road pass into the hands
of the reorganized company. It is believed
that Huntington has, indirectly or other
wise, obtained a share in the controlling
power on the purchasing committee ap
pointed by the reorganization board at
New York to acquire the Oregon corpora
tion's property.
For a long time the Southern Pacific has
closely watched the trend of affairs under
keceiver McNeil's management, and when
it was mentioned that the Union Pacific
would probably regain control of the
Oregon Railway and Navigation line when
its affairs were in shape, rumors came
thick and fast from San Francisco that the
Southern Pacific interests were actively at
work to defeat the objects of its trans
continental rival. One reason for believ
ing that there is an alliance somewhere is
that simultaneously with the formal sale
of the Oregon Railway and Navigation
Company's property came the announce
ment of a cessation of the rate war be
tween the Southern Pacific and the Oregon
line, which had been in progress in freight
and passenger traffic between San Fran
cisco and Portland for months past. The
Southern Pacific had a losing fi^ht of it,
and, inasmuch as the company bad been
losing money steadily on the Shasta
special, it had good cause for welcoming a
restoration of the old rates. The Oregon
corporation is well able to continue the
fight witn its steamer service, and those
who are acquainted with the situation
assert that peace was declared between the
companies because the California corpora
tion had power to declare peace.
Then, again, a suspicious state of peace
exists on the Columbia river between the
competing companies- Instead of the
usual fight for seashore travel, the Colum
bia River and Puget Sound Railway and
Navigation Company, which is allied with
the Southern Pacific interests, has put
rates at top notch to the coast and Puget
Sound. There is an agreement with the
Oregon Railway ana Navigation people to
maintain rates, and both companies,
through the influence of Mr. Hunting
ton's corporation, have adopted an inter
changeable system of handling each other's
freight and passenger traffic that seems
curious to those who have hitherto seen
war to the knife between them.
CLAIMS HE IS A PORTCGUESE.
Convict Ah Sam Objects to a Deportation
to China.
PORTLAND, Or., July 19.â Judge Bel
linger has been called upon to decide
"Whether a man whose father is claimed
to have been a Portuguese and his mother
a Chinese woman is a Chinese within the
meaning of the registration act, or other
wise?" The case involves Ah Sam, alias
Sam Fcok, who was brought before the
court yesterday for an order that he be de
ported to China, because he is a felon.
Sam was serving a sentence in the
Oregon State penitentiary for larceny
at the time the law was passed
requiring Chinese to register. The Chi
nese registration law does not permit con
victs to take out certificates of registration,
and it provides that they shall be returned
to China. It is alleged by Sam that his
father was a native of Portugal, and con
sequently he is not a Chinese and is not
amenable to the registration law or sub
ject to deportation. The father is now
dead.
Sam came to Portland with his mother
when he was 6 years old. He remained
here for ten years and then went to Peking
witn" his mother. He subsequently re
turned to Portland and was convicted of
larceny. He speaks very little English,
and his appearance is that of a full-blooded
Chinese. The United States District At
torney contends that, as the accused has
adopted Chinese manners and customs
aud also a Chinese name and speass only
the Chinese language, to ail intents and
purposes he is a Chinese. Judge Bellineer
took the matter under advisement.

SLASHED BY AN EX-CONVICT.
Murderous Assault Over a Concrete-
Laying Dispute.
SAN JOSE. Cal., July 19.-John Nel
son, a Swedish laborer, had a narrow es
cape from death this evening at the hands
of Isador Salazar, an ex-convict. He was
slashed four times with a pocket-knife,
one of the blows laying the left side of his
neck open, the wound being eight inches
i> length. He was also gashed in the
back of the head, his nose was cut open,
and the fourth wound was across the
riuht hand. None of the arteries in the
neck were severed and Nelson will re
cover. The affair was the result of a dis
pute as to the respective merits of the
men in laying concrete. The assault was
unjustifiable, as Nelson was unarmed.
Salazar was released from San Quentin
about two months ago, after serving a
long term for garroting a man in this city.

Miss Ray.
HE FAILS TO EIBS THE BRIDE.
Nineteenth Century Progress Exem
plified in a Happy Ceremony
at Sunrise.
TULARE, Cal., July 19.â A unique and
romantic marriage took place in Tulare at
5 o'clock this morning; or, rather, it oc
curred in Tulare and Santa Cruz. The
wedding knot was tied through the me
dium of a telephone, the contracting par
ties in this city answering questions pro
pounded by a clergyman in Santa Cruz.
J. L. Lawler led Miss Ollie Ray to a point
some leagues distant from the altar over
which the pastor presided, hut nineteenth
century progress has set time and tide at
naught and the nuptial bond was fastened
as securely as though they were face to
face with him. But the parson cid not
kiss the bride.
The officiating clergyman was Rev. R.
H. Bateman of Santa Cruz. The bride
and groom repaired this morning to trie
Tulare office of the Sunset Telephone
Company and called up Rev. Mr. Bate
man. The reply came over the wires from
Santa Cruz that Rev. Mr. Bateman was in
readiness.
Then the ceremony began, Eli Manuel
receiving the inquires from the clergyman
and propounding them to the principals.
The groom responded over the wire, there
being two 'phones in the office. In this
way the rites were performed, and the
minister at Santa Cruz pronounced them
man and wife.
Tnose present were: B. Ray, father of
the bride; Mrs. T. J. Lawler, mother of
the groom ; Mr. and Mrs. W. A. Ray,
Misses Bessie, Meta and L*na Ray, Eli
Manuel and Sidney Lawler. After the
wedding the party repaired to the subur
ban residence of W. A. Ray, where they
partook of a wedding breakfast.
J. L. Lawler is manager of the Tulare
candy kitctien, which is owned by the
Lawler estate. He is also agent for the
Sunset Telephone Company, whose office
is in the rooms of the candy kitchen.
Everyone knows and likes "Jimmy." The
bnde is a handsome brunette. Botn have
lived in Tulare for many years, Mrs. Law
ler having come to this city from Warren
burg, Mo., while the groom is a native of
Illinois. Rev. R. H. Bateman was formerly
pastor of the First Christian Church oi Tu
iare, and Miss Ray was a member of his
church.

How Mr. I.a trier Arranged the Tketails
With Pastor JBttteman.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., July 19.â James
Lawler aud Miss Ollie Ray of Tulaxe had
some time ago decided that they -would,
become man and wife this morning and
that the ceremony should be perfinrmed
by the Rev. R. H. Bateman, pastor of the
Santa Cruz Christian Church, but Mr.
Bateman is busily engaged here preparing
for the annual meeting of the Christian
churches of Northern California, which
will begin at the tabernacle at G-arfield
Park on Tuesday, so it was impossible for
him to be in Tulare this morning.
When the minister informed his young
friends by telephone last night tnat he
was sorry he could not reach Tulare in
time to officiate at the wedding, Mi. Law* '
ler replied with a query,
' What's the matter with the telephone?"
"I don't know," said the clergyman.
"Don't you get me? I say I'm sorry I
couldn't be there "
"Oh, yes; I caught that all right ; but I
say what's the matter with marrying us
by telephone?"
Mr. Bateman was pleased with the nov
elty of the idea and asked when the cere
mony should be performed.
"At sunrise in the morning, " was the
reply; and so it waÂ« arranged, and at day
light this morning Mr. Bateman "met"
the couple by telephone, with 250 miles of
wire between them, and pronounced them
man and wife. His daughter, Miss May
Baieman, telephoned her congratulations.
The voices of the several persons were
easily recoenized.

THE HANDBALL COURTS.
Competition for the General J. G.
Wall MedaJs Com
menced.
A Number of Interesting and Closely
Contested Games Played
Yesterday.
The bandbajl conrtÃ were well patronized
yesterday and the games were more than
usually interesting. At the San Francisco
court great interest was* manifested in a
game between G, McDonald and M. Mc
.Neil and Phil Ryan, the proprietor of the
court, and L. Corraine for a French dinner
for ten. McDonald and McNeil won after
some clever play on both sides. Phil
Ryan attributed his defeat to tbe fact that
he indulged too freely in buttermilk, a
friend in Marin County having presented
him with a live-gallon keg on Saturday.
J. Riordan, the coast champion, and J.
Lawless played against P. T. Donnelly,
the amateur champion, and M. Dillon.
Each team won two games and the final
was postponed till next Sunday.
At the Union Court four soldiers from
the Presidio and Angel Island carried all
before them. They showed they could
handle a handball as deftly as a musket.
An exciting game was played between W.
McMar.us and J. McNamara and Tore
O'Brien and J. Kennedy, the two former
winning. The event ol the day *Â«â  be-
tweeu J. Wren and Terry McMannsand J.
Nelson and J. J. Feeney. It was closely
contested, the final being won by Nelson
and Feeney by four aces.
The Occidental Court was thrown open
to the public yesterday and a large crowd
saw the opening games for the General J.
O. Wall medals. The central some time
ago donated $100 and the money has been
(tlvideil into four medalsâ s4o, $30, $20 and
$10. The conditions are that each player
must meet every man in his class and tne
one having the'hichest percentage in each
class wins the medal. The games will bo
played only on Sundays.

JOE CHOYNsKI'S RIGHT DELIVERY BEFORE LANDING.
THE SAX FRAKCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JULY 20, 1896.
WILL THEY HER
COME TO BLOWS?
A Hard Conundrum to Solve
in the Prospective
Fight.
CHOYNSKI AND MAHER,
Queer Attitude of the Clubs
Wanting to Be in
Control.
SANGUINE YOUNG MITCHELL.
Judson Gibbs, James J Groom and
W. R. Vice Have a Mix-Up on
Railroad Fares.
There is a severe congestion in
pugilism and the City Fathers are the
doctors.
Whether the police will interfere or not
j Is a secondary proposition, but if they do
; the patient is sure to die.
The trouble is that there are too many
I clubs that want to handle the few star
; prize- fighters of note who come this way.
There is the National Athletic Club,
then comes the New Occidental Club and
finally the Olympic Athletic Club.
The two former institutions have more
money to spend or to offer than the latter,
for the reason that the Olympic Club does
not mix in the theatrical business and its
$4000 offer as a purse for the Peter Maher-
CboynsKi ei<;L? or ten-round sparring
match is only for the benefit of the fight
ers and tbe delectation of the club mem
bers.
The other two institutions, if such they
can be called, cannot be placed on tbe
same footing with the Olympic with its
thousand bona tide members ana its
thirty odd years' standing in tl.e com
munity.
The National Athletic Club, born six
ymonths ago, really came into prominence
with the Corbett Hharkey four-round fight
some weeks ago.
It does not claim a membership beyond
its officers â President J. Ross Jackson.
Treasurer Judson Gibbs and Secretary J,
J. Groom.
The New Occidental Club is even worse
off as to executives, as John Herget, better
known as "Young Mitchell," is the only
head and front. He claims, however, that
thousands of members are joining tha
club each week. This, however, is on the
baaiu that each man purchasing a ticket
to a fight given by the club entitles him
to membership.
This is the standing of the three clubs
in the field bidding for the Mahcr-Choyn
ski mill and tbe likelihood of either
gettintr the plum must be deducted from
tbe following:
The fighters state primarily that they
will not enter the ring for less than a^iOOO
purse.
This purse has been offered them by
J. J. Groom, also representing J. Ross
Jackr-on and Judson Gibbs, the National
1 Athletic Club. But the said club was
refused a permit to conduct tbe fight when
they applied for it a few days ago to the
Board of Supervisors. Hence Maher and
Choynski cannot mix up their punches
under the auspices of the triumvirate.
Then again Judaon Gihbs, an old-time
member of the pioneer California Athletic
Club, composed of the most influential
men in the State, is not in the best repute
with his old friends just now. Since the
California Club broke up and the direct
ors, who did so much to establish pugil
ism in this part of the country, retired
into privacy, Judson Gibbs has gone into
the business of bringing the pugs together
and has not recognized his old associates.
As a consequence he has made many ene
mies among them and they are fighting to
kill the National Athletic Club.
As to the New Occidental Club the Â»itua
tion ia simply this:
"I Will not go over $4000," said Young
Mitchell last evening. "1 think that is
enough for Maher and Choynski, and that
offer has been made to them by the Olym
pic Club.
"They can do their own business with
the Olympics or with the Nationals, and
when Ihey K et through I'll talk busineaÃ
with them, but they can't get more than
?4000 from me.
"As to the Nationals' offer of $6000 that's
all right, I guess, but they haven't got
their permit. I've got two permits and so
has the Olympics. I can have one light
next month and another whenever I want.
There is no iÂ»ariicu!ar date. Only I don't
want to conflict with any light the Olym
pic Club wants to give, because it would
do me no good nor would it help them. If
they get Maher and Chuynski they are
welcome to them. I can get some other
good fighters.
"Members are coming in fast in the New
Occidental Club, and we are going to hire
Armory Hall on Golden Gate avenue and
tit it up as a jrynmnsiurc."
While tbe three-cornered fight to engage
Maher and Choynski is going on the
Union I'aciftc Kailroad has got into the
field, giving the whole affair, and the Na
tional Athletic Club in particular, a stiff
upper-cut It seems that when Judson
Gibbs and J. J. Groom wanted to get Peter
Mtiher out here to fight Joe Ohoynski they
authorized \\'. R. Vice of the Union Pa
cific to wire Maher and his two compan
ions, Lowery ana Connolly, transportation
from Pittsburg to this City and back, in
volvinp an obligation of $219 50. This was
done, and the lighters lost no time in leav
ing the smoky city for the California
green fields.
When the National Athletic Club
i learned tbtre was no chance of getting a
I permit from the Supervisors to bring off
; the light theyâ Groom and Gibbs â rushed
' off to find Vice and countermand their or
der for transportation. It was too late,
j however. Maher and his suite were al
; ready on the way. The pugilists are here
now fll tliis transportation, and Vice is
i looking for his coin.
a > to Maher, he is enjoying the sights,
and yesterday be was about taking i:i the
Cliff House and other places best calcu
: lated to afford him comfortable training
quarters, in case he manages to get some
responsible club to hang up a suitable
purse for his go with Joe Choynski. The
latter is now in the East.
THE TWO STANDARDS.
Rev. Mr. William* Preached I,ast Night
on Morality and Secularism.
The Rev. Dr. Williams of the Plymouth
Congregational Cnurcu preached last even
ing on "The Two Standards."â the one a
moral and the other a secular standard.
He said that things were made for men,
not men for things. Man is greater than
anything on earth, he said, because he
bears the likeness of his Maker. Accord
ing to the secular standard wealth is the
criterion of a man's success. Tlie acquisi
tion of wealth is the one interest and aim
of the individual of to-day. Merit in Cali
forna is measured by money, but on the
plains of heaven by character. The three
elements of the moral standard are work,
prayer and love. By practicing these
three the soul will possess a peaceand
contentment that will last through eter
nity.
BULLSEYE AND
RING TARGETS,

Riflemen at Schuetzen
Park.

ter for a Champion Class
Medal.
MRS, J. UTSCHIG'S FINE SCORE.
A Reubold Took the Cadets' First
Prize-rGrutli Sharpshooters
Kept Busy.
There was a goodly gathering of marks
men yesterday at Schuetzen Park, and
good results were obtained on the targets.
The California Schuetzan Club was out in
full force for its monthly buliseye contest
for cash prizes. In a buliseye contest each
marjcsman was allowed twenty shots.
Not a few brought down from eight to
fourteen black discs. At the conclusion of
the shoot these discs, all of which are
numbered to correspond with the scorer's
record, were taken to tbe stand and the
bits measured by a delicate machine that
measures to a one-thousandth part of an
inch. J. C. Waller's best shot appeared to
be plumb in tha center, but tbe machine
showed that be was 113 points short. A.
Jungblut's best was just a little off the
center, and his record was 411 points. The
prize-winners and their scores are an
nexed in the order of their winning:
First, J. C.Waller, 113 points; 2d, A.Junjtblut,

The California Schuetzen Club Cadets
also had a buliseye shoot. A. Reubold
won the first prize, H. Kuhls the second
and J. Kullm&nn the third.
One of the prettiest contests on the
range was that between Mrs. John Utschig
and Miss Lizzie TJtschig, mother and
daughter. It occurred in the Ladies'
California Schuetzen Club's monthly
medal shoot. Both are in the champion
class and they shot at double rest at 200
yards, five shots to a score, German ring
target. Miss Utschijj's score was 23, 22,
19, 24. 22â110. The event was a tie on
points, but Mrs. Utschig won by Greed
moor ruling, making a 23 on her last
shot.
The lady winners were:
Championship classâ Mrs. John Utschie. 19.
24, 20, 24, 23â110 rings.
First classâ Mrs. H. L. Wise, 22. 25, 18, 20

19,18,24-94.
On August 23 the ladies' clnb will nold a
grand prize shoot, open to all comers, for
merchandize prizes. Thete are quite a
number of lady sharpshooters in this lo
cality, and the members of the club are
anxious for them to participate in the
event.
The monthly medal shoot of the San
Francisco Turner Schuetzen Club brought
out a fair representation, and the contests
in the several classes were decidedly
spirited. Each fired twenty shots on the
German ring target, and annexed are the
winners and their scores:
Champion classâ John Utsohig Sr., 19, 23,

A GREAT CRICKET SCORE
H. Richardson of the Pacifies
Breaks the Coast
Record.
Yesterday was a red-letter day for the
Pacific Club cricketers, â¢ and particularly
for H. Richardson, their star batsman. In
the cup contest against the California
team at Golden Gate the player in ques
tion put ud a total of 208 runs, thus beat
ing the coast record, held by Captain Rob
ertson of the Bohemians, by 2 runs. .
The Pacifies won the toss and sent their
opponents in. - After compiling 96, to
which score - Guild was the chief con
tributor, the Californias took the field and
held the wickets for the remainder of the
day. Their score of 343, two-thirds of
which was credited to the champion of
the day, needs little comment. It is only
fair to add, however, that the losing side
lacked three of its best players, a fact that
in great measure accounts for their defeat
by 247 runs. The score:

Electors.
ATTITUDE ON TRADES TJSIONS.
The Socialist Labor Party Has De
clared Itself for a State
Campaign.
The red flag floated with the stars and
stripes above the old Temple at 115 Turk
street yesterday, for inside the Socialist
Labor party was holding its State Con
vention.
Delegates from Oakland, San Jose and
San Francisco were present and though
their number was small there were sin
cerity and enthusiasm sufficient for a large
political convention. The meeting was
called to order at 10 a. m., with George
Aspden as temporary chairman. He in
troduced Miss Susan B. A.nthonv, who
was present to speak on behalf of woman's
suffrage.
Miss Anthony was received with ap
plause. She said: "I am, as you know, a
non-partisan in politics. I am as good a
Socialist this morning as I was a Republi
can at last night's meeting in Berkeley or
a Democrat at the Buckley ratification
meeting a week ago in the Metropolitan
Temple. I am not a stranger in your
labor conventions or the councils of labor's
representatives.
"Away back years ago I was a delegate
from a working-woman's club in a labor
congress held in my home city. Among
the most welcome and encouraging greet
ings extended to the woman's National
suffrage organization in its work for the
cause of equal rights, none has arrived
that could exceed in its sincerity tbe aid
and sympathy received from the socialist
democratic organizations throughout the
world.
'Your party has been the pioneer party
to reco.nize our claims and to embody a
female suffrage plank in your platform.
On my arrival in your City, it was my
pleasure and privilege to" address your
members before one of the socialist
branches. I hope to have the pleasure
of comim: before you again during the
next few weeks."
In conclusion, Miss Anthony related an
account of the work done by the woman
suffragists in the various State conven
tions.
The convention at once proceeded to the
election of permanent officers, with the
following results:
George Aspden. chairman; Edel Hecht,
secretary.
Commiittee on credentialsâ H. Sahlender,
A. J. Mervy and William Lewis.
Committee on platiorm and resolutions â
James Andrew, A. J. Mervy, G. B. Benham.
Almost immediately the committee
on credentials reported the following
named delegates present and entitled to
seats in tbe convention:
State executiveâ Emil Liess, Theodore Lynch,
Leo Grasser, Herman a Sahlender, G. B.
Benham, Gustave Po'tler, E. T. Kiugslev, Edel
Hecht.
San Francisco section, Jewish branchâ Wil.
Mam Lewis. H. Bernard. Liberty branchâ H.
â VVarnecKe Jr., Leo Grasser, G. W. Metzger, W.
If: Willey. German branchâ H. Warnecke, H.
Bahiender, H. Benhke, A. Miller, H. Franck, C.
Prossak. American branchâ George Aspden
G. B. Benham, E. T. Kiugsley, E. \V. Carpenter.
Oakland section â James Andrew, John H.
Jones.
San Jose sectionâ A. J. Mervy.
The report of the committee was re
ceived and the convenion adjourned until
afternoon, when the committee on plat
form would oe ready to submit a report.
At the opening of the afternoon session
Chairman Aspden called for the report of
the State executive. It was recommended
in this report that the convention confine
its work to the nomination of officers to
be voted for by the State- *hat is for Pres
idential Electors and a Lien tenant Gov
ernor â and leave the nomination of Con
gressman and Assemblyman to Congres
sional and Assembly districts.
The report stated that finances were at a
low ebb. But $10 hao been received by the
State committee from the sale of due
stamps. It had transpired.that secretaries
of sections and branches, instead of re
ceipting dues with those stamps on mem
bership cards, simply signed the papers.
Such cards were declared invalid and per
sons holding them were not members of
the party. The report also stated that
steps have been taken to organize a strong
section in Stockton.
The committee on platform and resolu
tions presented the following resolutions
which were discussed and adopted seria
tum:
RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.
Whereas, Attempts have been made In cer
tain quarters to rekindle religious feuds which
6houid have no part in the political or econ
omic discussions of civilized countries in these
times, be It
Rceohed, That we express our detestation ot
all organizations bused upon religious intol
erance* and regard them as mere devices to di
vide the workers, play into the hands of pos
sessing classes and to' perpetuate the present
exploiting system.
woman's suffrage.
Whereas, The platform of the Socialist La
bor party contains a plank declaring in favor
of woman's suffrage; and whereas, the pro
posed amendment to the constitution of the
State of California, known as the eleventh
amendment, is in accordance with said plank
in said platiorm, therefore, be it
Resolved, That the Socialist Labor party of
California, in convention assembled, indorse
the eleventh amendment and recommend
its members to voie therefor.
THE SILVER QUESTION.
Whkreas, We feel the sureness of no assist
ance coming to the producers by any mone
tary arrangement except by a circulating me
dium based upon average social labor per
formed; and whereas, we recognise in the
struggle for and against the free coinage of
silver, at the ratio of 16 to 1, merely a contest
of classes of capitalists as to a division of the
products of labor and a phase of the debt-rid
den middle-class struggle for existence; and
whereas, such free coinage would be benefi
cial, if at ali, to other than the producing
class, who are propertyless and debtiess, but
creditors in employment; be it
Resolved, That we disapprove of the free coin
age of silver, at a ratio of 16 to 1. by the
Tinted States, as being class legislation for the
debtor class, detrimental to the interests of
the wage-earners, tending to further despoil
ihe producer- by cheapening their labor and
reducing their purchasing p.>wer.
.NEW TRADF.S-VNIOM6M.
Whereas. The Socialist Labor party of the
United .States, sympathizing with the efforts of
organized labor in it! struggles to defend itself
against the aggressions of organized capital, is
now and always has been the friend and active
supporter of trades-unionism; wisely guiding
it on lines looking to the final emancipation
of the working class and guarding it against
designing individuals who seek to keep the
rank and file in ignorance of the means wiiere
by alone, freedom and the full products of
their labor can be secured to the workers, viz. :
collective ownership and control of land and
the tools of production; and, whereas, the en
franchised workers cannot make their ballots
effective while in ignorance of their clas-,
character and condition they continue to cast
their votes on election day lor the party ticket!
of those who own and control the means
whereby they (the worker*; are held iv bond
age, whatever rosy promises the political lead
ers aX candidates for office on capitalist party
tickets, may hold out to them ; therefere, be it
Resolved, By this convention of the State sec
tions of the Socialist Labor party in San Fran
cisco, Cal., assembled, that we unqualifiedly
Indorse the "new trades union" movement aÂ«
evidenced in the Socialist Trades and Labor
Alliance of the United States and Canada, and
that we approve the San Francisco Trade and
Labor Alliance's laudable efforts to wrest from
the unclean hands of aiiam labor leaders the
rank and file In the trades unions, who are
being unconsciously used to help to-called
"friends of labor" to political positions while
standing on party platforms designed and
drawn up by the avowed enemies of labor.
And be it further
Resolved, Tuat, believing in the worker re
ceiving tne full product of his labor, we cal 1
upon the rank and file in organized labor to
forever cast off the party yoke of its industrial
masters and work with and vote with the
Socinlist Labor partyâ the only party of the
people in the United States.
Tbe resolution condemning silver called
out some strong language. August Miller
declared: "The working classes of the
United States are crazy on the silver ques
tion. What good does it do the Socialist
Labor party to bring the question before
the public? Better to ignore it altogether.'
Edel Hecht, the secretary, replied that
it was a question Â«blch the Socialist Labor
party could not afford to ignore. "It is of
vital interest to the working people," he
â¢aid, "and, therefore, I am in favor of put
ting the party on record as declaring
against the fallacy of silver."
"If the people are crazy," exclaimed
James Andrew, "then it is the duty of
some one to cure them. Is it right, then,
to leave the people in their ignorance?"
Recommendations were made by the
committee tbat a party paper in English
be established on the Pacific Coast; and
also that a manifesto be issued to voters of
California calling attention to tbe en
croachments of machinery and the conse
quent distress; the waste and want engen
dered by merciless competitors and the
chaotic state of mind and society destroyed
by present chaotic and planless individual
production and distribution, and the utter
inadequacy and wor thlessness of the voter
sustaining" any political measure except
clear-cut propositions for a co-operative
commonwealth.
Nominations were then in order. The
chair announced that the party was not
>et a legal political party, but before the
coming elections it would obtain signa
tures of voters all over California and pre
sent to the State officials a petition of at
least 3 per centum of the voters for a place
on the ticket.
James Andrew of Berkeley was nomi
nated for Lieutenant-Governor.
Ktml Liess, editor of tne San Francisco
Tageblati, and L. Biddle of Los Angeles
were named for Presidential electors.
The Tageblatt was commended by vote
and declared to be the workinemen's
paper in the German language in Califor
nia.
Singing the Marseillaise, tbe convention
adjourned to the call of the chair.
POM OS A SCHOOL WAB.
Professor Molyneaux's Resignation De
manded, by the Trustee:
LOS ANGELES, Cal., July Profes
sor Molyneaux, principal of the public
schools at Pomona and one of the "solid
four" trustees of the State Normal School
in this city, is having a peck of trouble at
the home end of his double official labors.
At a meeting of the Pomona Board of
Education yesterday a resolution was pre
sented by F. K. Adams and unanimously
passed requesting Superintendent Moly
neaux to resign. This brought about an
angry discussion, : Professor Molvneaux
contending that the board bad neither the
moral nor the legal right to make this de
mand, upon the heels of his vindication of
the charges recently preferred against him.
The board took the ground that, in view of
his virtual promise to resign whenever
three members of the board should request
it, the time had arrived when it would be
best for the interests of the schools in
Pomona that he step out.
Finally another resolution was passed
demanding his resignation, declaring that
the board considered the office now vacant,
and requiring that on . or before Monday
next Professor Molyneaux inform the
board what he intended to do in tbe
matter. Professor Molyneaux said that be
would hold the members of the board
personally responsible for his salary.
NEWS OF MARE ISLAND.
Stores Sent to San Francisco to
Be Placed Aboard the
Oregon.
Secretary of the Navy Herbert Ex
pected to Visit the Station
Soon.
VALLEJO. Cal., July 19.â Hundreds of
boxes of. stores of all kinds are being
packed and sent to San Francisco on the
navy-yard tug for the battle-ship Oregon.
It is safe to say that the officers on the
big white leviathan have had a monkey
and a parrot time in unpacking and stor
ing the gear away, as much of the stuff
has never been used on board ship before,
and being new to some of them it is hard
to tell what it is for.
According to a letter Senator Perkins
sent to the Board of Trade of Vallejo there
was no particular reason why the Oregon
went into commission at San Francisco in
stead of Vallejo except that the contractors
bad completed her and it was in the dis
cretion of the Government to receive the
ship in the harbor of San Francisco or to
order her to Vallejo, and the admiral con
sented to receive her in San Francisco.
By so doing the contractors saved the cost
of taking the Oregon to Mare Island.
This statement explodes the story of
shallow water in the channel. . The Ore
gon, however,' is not likely to come up to
the navy-yard at present, but will go over
to Sausalito and remain for a time before
going northward.
Work of all kinds is beginning to be
rushed at the' yard. Over 1000 men are
now employed. The Bennington is about
ready for sea, and if . orders are not re
voked will go north to join the Philadel
phia. It was first presumed the Benning
ton ' would go to China; and relieve the
orktown, but such will not be the case.
The United States ship Alert will come
to the yard after the men have had liberty
at San Francisco. She will be placed out
of commission and hauled out into the
Row, to remain until a lull comes in other
and more important work. Â°It is not ex
pected it will be, like the Ranger, trans
formed into a boat. Workmen are
busy aboard the Ranger, and when they
finish the vessel will be far more comfort
able than the modern gunboats, without
masts, sails or spars. ' ' / â 
The Bureau of Equipment will send 160
homing pigeons to the yard, for use in
carrying messages from ships-of-war while
at sea to the navy-yard. A large and
handsome cote is to be erected on the hill,
near the steam engineering storehouse.
Passed; Assistant Surgeon Annan . Far
renholt arrived at the navy-yard this
morning on Ms way to the Navy hospital
from the monitor Monterey.
A branch of the steam engineering shop
is to be located in yards and docks build
ing, to expedite business on board ships
when lying at the quay wall undergoing
repairs. Men now nave to walk to the
shop at the upper eno of the island if they
wish a tool or piece of iron to work with.
v The Secretary of the * Navy ; is expected
to visit the yard in a short time. No par
ticular demonstration is looked for from
the citizens on his behalf. That his visit
will result to the benefit of the yard goes
without saying. .. , s:
The cruiser Charleston is being dis
mantled and will go out of commission
in a short ? time. The , Baltimore - has a
small > gang, working on the engines. It
will be six months -or ; more before the
cruiser will be ready for sea. - - â  -

A | Polo Game Yesterday and Svme of the Crackajack Swimmers of the lurline
FOR PHYSICAL CULTURE
The Bathing Establishments
Crowded With Pleased
Spectators.
Exhibition of High Div ng and Fancy
Swimming by Lurline
Experts.
The growing public interest in the sub
ject of physical culture was evidenced
yesterday by tbe unusually large crowds
of spectators assembled at the various
salt-water swimming and bathing estab
lishments of the City.
At the Lurline Baths, on Lark in street,
there was no end of fun and excitement.
The swimmers vied with one another in
tbe execution of fancy strokes, high dives,
double somersaults, etc., and their exhibi
tions of aquatic skill were heartily ap
plauded by the admiring spectators.
Every Friday evening at the Lurline
there are contests at polo â football in the
waterâ followed by a varied exhibition of
high and fancy diving and swimming.
The polo team, consisting of Captain J. A.
Geddes, forward; Ed Stolle, forward; W.
C. Pomin, center; E. Schanz, left-Back;
M. de Lvon, right-back, and R. B. Stolle.
goalkeeper, now holds the J. D. Spreckels
trophy â a magnificent silver cvp â and is
prepared to play any amateur team on the
Pacific Coast for the championship. Many
notable swimmers may be seen any Sun
day in the tank of the Lurline.
Dan Renear, 17 years of age and a native
of New Jersey, is the champion amateur
100-yard swimmer of the Pacific Coast
His time of 1 minute b\i seconds is a
United States record, and was made over
the official course of the Lurline last De
cember.
He has a peculiar over-band stroke of
much power. He is a fancy diver and an
all around springboard and trapeze per
former.
The champion quarter of a mile swim
mer is Ed Stolle, a native of San Fran
cisco, only 16 years of age. His record is
6 minutes 40 2-5 seconds. He is also the
champion 220-yard swimmer, at which
distance his best time is 2 minutes 45 sec
onds. He is assistant captain of the polo
team and one of its strongest players, in
his races l.c uses a powerful side stroke
to great advantage, lie is willing to meet
any amateur on the coast in a quarter-of
a-mile contest.
J. A. Gendes. the captain of the polo

THE MORM ON VIEW.
Henry s. Tanner Speak* of an Ancient
and Modem Christianity.
President Henry S. Tanner of the Cali
fornia Mormon mission addressed a gath
ering in Pythian Castle last night udou
the "Apostasy from Primitive Christian
ity." He said: "When we compare the
sects of modern Christendom with the
church of Jesus Christ as established by
Jesus we see a wide and remarkable de
parture from the faith once deliTered to
the saints. The existence of various op
posing religions is conclusive evidence that
men have been engaged in their invention,
for God's mind is one, men's minds are
various.
"The infant molds from the clay a rude
fieure which it calls a goat, but as the child
grows .n aptness we see ihe development
of its designs until we discern the perfect
model, instead of this evolution in re
ligion there has been a deterioration
whim reveals the device and cunning of
men. Paul said that the second advent of
Christ would not come until a 'falling
away' should occur, when men would not
endure sound doctrine. Ihe combined
powers of the world changed and de
ranged the beliefs and practices of the
church, until she was divested of her
purity, simplicity and unanimi ty and her
members driven from the earth by the
winds of oppression."

RAILROAD CONFERENCE.
Several Big Official* Have Arrived to
Discuss tbe Oriental Passenger
Question.
A consultation of railroad magnates is
to be held here during a large part of this
week, presumably to discuss the Oriental
passenger traffic to this port and to devise
means for successfully competing with the
Canadian Pacific and with the several
prospective Japanese steamship lines that
will have termini north and south of San
Francisco and will help to divert the pas
senger traffic both from tbis port and from
the Eastern railroad lines now catering to
the travel through this City.
Last night \V. B. K-niskeon, general
agent of the Cfiicago and Northwestern
Railroad, arrived at the Palace from Chi
cago and the membership of tbe confer
ence was then complete. In the forenoon
Thomas D. McKay, general passenger
agent at Yokaharna, of the Occidental and
Oriental Steani*hij) Company, of the Pa
cific Mail B(Â«UDtnip Company, of the
Union Pacific, and of the Chicago and
Northwestern Railway, arrived on the
China from Japan. Friday night E. L.
Lomax, general agent of the Union Pacific
Railroad, arrived from Omaha.
They are all here for this meeting, in
which representatives of the Southern
Pacific A'ill also have a voice.
When seen at the Palace last night Mr.
Kniskeon was not very communicative
uppn the exact nature of the conference.
"Just a little da.K-lantern talk we've
arranged, that's all," he said. "Tom Mc-
Kay has been out there eighteen months,
and we wanted to talk over the commerce
to this port. We feel no alarm on account
of the prospective Japanese line to Seattle.
There is bound to be a general increase in
travel from the Orient, and we'll never
notice the competition."
Mr. McKay with his inimitable cordial
ity was also uncommunicative upon the
business that will be transacted, but he
declared very empbatichliv tbat tiie meet
ing was not occasioned by any dissatisfac
tion with the manner in wuich he has
handled bis end of the line.
With Hig Little Hatchet.
Thomas AUcott, a laborer, with a hatchet in
his hand, was terrorizing people on Van Ness
avenue, near Hayes street, yesterday afternoon
when Policeman i- ujanr.n arrested him. He
waÂ« crazy with drink and drul.-tred that he
was George Wagnin^ion and never told a lie.
A charge of ''drunk" was booked against him.
THE GOLDEN WEST CLUB
Young Republicans Whose First
Vote Will Go for Me-
Kioley.
An Organ zation Rapidly Increasing
in Strength and Influence in
Local Politics.
Tbe fact that the young men of San
Francisco have taken a deep interest in
the political issues of the day is encour
aging, for it shows there is no apathy in
the ranks of the people regarding the
fundamental principles of self-govern
ment. Of such material are the members
of the Golden West Republican Club com
posed.
This club was first organized in March,
1892, of young men who at that time were
about to cast their first votes. In 1894 the
club assumed manhood proportions, and
by adding still more members, all young
men, it made its power felt at the last elec
tion. Now once more, with its originators
and with acquired knowledge in the sci
ence of government and still adding to its
roll, it has become one of the leading
young men's Republican clubs of the City.
Tbe officers and members of this club
are machanics and workmen in shops, aud
manufacturing institutions, where labor
is respected and idleness despised. In
politics they are Republican, not because
their fathers before them bad affiliated
with that party, but from their own ex
perience, learned by a careful study of tbe
principles of tbat party.
Tbe following are the officers elected on
the evening of last Friday at Federation
Hall, Howard street: President, William
B. Crane; vice-president, John Crowley;
recording secretary, James Carroll; treas
urer, Louis Sericano: corresponding sec
retary, Frank Wail; executive committee â
William P. Connors, J. J. Daugnney, T.
McDermott; sergeant-at-arms, Ed Bir
mingham.
After the election of officers speeches
were made by several, of the mernbeis.
The club unanimously indorsed the Re
publican platform as formulated at the St.
Louis convention and Hon. William Me
fcLinley, the nominee. Three rousing
cheers were also given for John D.
Spreckels.
SHOT DOWN
IN COLD BLOOD,
Lee Ti Murdered by an Un
known Assassin Last
Night.
A BULLET IN HIS HEAD.
The Killing Was the Outgrowth
of an Old Highbinders'
Feud.
THE VICTIM A CLAM-DEALEB.
He Was One of the Sam Yup Family
That Was Under a Boycott by
the Sse Tups.
Lee Ti, a Chinese clam and fish dealar,
was shot to death shortly after midnight
in the hallway at the foot of the stairs
leading to a gambling den at 25 Waverly
place. The murderer, who is still un
known, fired two shots at his victim. The
first bullet struck the wall, but the second
bit the Chinaman in the back of the head.
The assassin fled to Clay street and dis
appeared around the corner, but his victim
was dead almost before he could have gone
two blocks.
Ti had been in the gambling house and
went out to get a bottle of whisky. It was
on his return that he met his death.
A Japanese named H. Ito witnessed tbe
murder, and said that Ti was evidently
aware that his enemy was following him,
for the Jap noticed that a second man was
evidently iyiug in wait close to the hall
way for the clam-dealer's return.
Officer J. D. Long was standing on the
corner of Washington street, and although
he went on a run to the spot he did not
see the one who did the shooting, because
in the excitement a dozen or more Chinese
began to run in all directions.
The officer and Morgue officials are of
the opinion that after the first shot Ti
slipped and fell on bis face and that the
murderer placed the weapon against the
back of tne prostrate man's head and fired
the second shot.
The bullet went through the man's head
and made its exit at his note and then
went through the floor.
He had a wife, with whom he lived at
72bÂ° Commercial street.
Last night's murder was the culmina
tion of a long-standing emnity between
the See Yup and Sam Yup companies.
About, a year ago the See Yups declared a
boycott on the Sam Yup company.
This boycott has been oppressing China
town's poor for almost a year, and as its
effect has raised tbe price of all Chinese
commodities fully 20 per cent it is evident
that the poverty-stricken Celestials have
just cause for complaint.
This fact, however, is not considered as
being worthy of a second thought in the
minds of the agitators, and in consequence
Chinatown is bubbling over with excite
ment. .
A few weeks ago the strongest Chinese
faction in this City, known as the Wong
family, under the leadership of Chee
Tong, withdrew from the See Yup Com
pany, with the object of breaking the boy
cott on the Sam Yup Company.
Highbinders stalked through tbe streets
discussing the withdrawal oi the Wong
family and trouble was imminent. An
extra force of policemen was detailed to
Datrol the streets of the Mongolian quar
ter. They were instructed tbat in event
of a riot or trouble of any description they
were to use all the means in their power to
preserve the peace.
Up to a few weeks ago Chee Tong was
tbe secretary of the See Yup Company,
but he was discharged on some pretense
or other, and forthwith laid plans to equal
ize tbe score.
First be got the Wone family to with
draw from the See Yup Company in order
to break up this boycott.
Then he issued circulars stating tbat any
member might buy wherever and what
ever he pleased and at whatever place he
could get what he wanted the cheapest
He also stated that in case of any trouble
the Wong family would take a hand, and,
if necessary, resort to force of arms.
Upon heari ig this the See Yup Company
immediately posted circulars all over the
Chinese quarters. Groups were scattered
through the streets, deeply interested in
the lurid-colored posters.
Kong Chow, secretary of the See Yups
and a member of the Bo Ong Tong Society,
was the person who issued the circulars,
which are freely translated as follows:
Members of the See Yup Company do not
stir up any trouble. We made a contract last
July to boycott the Sam Yup Company, and as
the Wong family has withdrawn we must see
that they Â«re brought back Into the combina
tion. Act like gentlemen and make no trouble
on the street. Use discretion so aÂ» to uphold
the honor of the company, but be firm and
stand by the contract.
The See Yup has twelve societies and
made a contract to boycott the Sam Yup
Company over a year ago last July. This
bas caused .many murders and in all
probability will cause many more.
Riverside Murderer*.
Sheriff W. B. Johnston of Riverside and one
of his deputies arrived at the City Prison yes
terday afternoon from San Quentin with two
brothers, Caesar and John Cummings. The
Sheriff will leave with the two brothers for
Riverside this morning, where they will be
sentenced to be hanged for the murder of
Rnuch.er Narramore last August. They were
sentenced to be hanged about four months
ago, but their attorney mi.vcd for a new trial
which the Supreme Court has refused.
Fistaer Arrested.
Edward Fisher, who smashed a glass pitcher
over the head of R. C. Richardson on Saturday
night, was arrested at hin residence, s'2la
Natoma street. Fisher returned home for the
purpose of changing his clothing before elud
ing the officeis, but he was caught in the trap
set for him.

GARRET A. HOBART, of New Jersey
ELECTION NOVEMBER 3, 1896.
What will the Pops do?
Bryan is on the anxious seat.
This week will put the campaign in
shape.
The question of the day for you: Have
you registered yet ?
If the Populists wish to be in the fashion
some of them must bolt.
It ls observed already that Sewall's ship
pin? record is not helping hiÂ« party any.
Ten to one on McKinley is the way the
betting goes and the vote will be about the
same.
No intelligent silver Republican will be
willing to intrust free coinage to a free
trader.
If promises are worth anything Mr.
.Bryan is prepared to give the Populists all
they wish.
The country is beginning to discover
tbat after all Cleveland really is better
than his party.
Southern Populists will unite with
Southern Democrats in a wrestling match,
but not in a dance.
Give to capital the assurance of protec
tion and it will soon give work and wages
to every American.
There is one thing certain, Populists en
gaged in tbe wool industry will not fuse
with the free-traders.
The only reason the Democrats do not
make this a campaign of explanation is
tuat they cannot exolain.
Don't forget that Thi Call is tbe only
morning paper in this City that geta the
dispatches of The United Press.
The eagerness of Bland to get a re-elec
tion to Congress shows he hasn't much
faith in a promise of a Cabinet ofliee.
Now that the welfare of every industry
is at stake, all business men will vote
together and make sure of prosDerity.
It need surprise nobody if the Bryan bal
loon collapses before the campaign gets
well started. Gas is a very uncertain
thing.
We can establish international bimetal
lism during the next four years if we in
trust the work to statesmen instead of boy
orators.
Since Tom Reed is to open the Republi
can campaign we may be sure it will be
opened clear through to the bottom at the
first lick.
Every one who wishes to see San Fran
cisco a borne market for home industry
should form a Republican club and help to
make it so.
McKinley's heroic service during the
war shows tbe stuff be is made of, and the
people will vote for him because tn Â«J "Â»â¼Â«
confidence in him.
The 16 to 1 movement in this campaign
will show sixteen bolters from the free
trade party to protection for every one
tbat goes the other way.
The star of empire has now moved po
far westward tbat the Atlantic Coast is
thankful wnen it gets a chance to have a
candidate for the Vice-Presidency.
Every business man in San Francisco
should register and have bis employes do
tbe same. Let us make sure of a rousing
victory for protection and prosperity.
The Populist convention may not be as
orderly as that of the Republicans, but it
will hardly be anything like such a rough
and tumble affair as the Democrats put up.
Long before this campaign is over mod
erate Democrats will be so sick of Silver
Bill and bis platform that they will be
tempted to throw up the whole patry for
the sake of getting rid of them.
Philadelphia is called slow, but she doe*
not wait on Congress for her river im
provements. She has just voted $500,000
for clearing the channel of the Delaware
and is going right ahead with the work.
Tbe announcement that Bryan is a
young and inexperienced man does not
terrify some Democrats. They comfort
themselves in tbe remembrance that he is
older than Cleveland was when he was
elected Sheriff of Erie County.
Even if the gold Democrats should put
up a candidate of tbeir own it is not likely
he would receive many votes. Business
men are taking no risks this year and even
those among them who are Democrats will
vote for McKinley and make sure of pros
perity.
SEWALL'S THORNS.
It needed jnst such a man as Arthur
Pewall to give emphasis to the hypocrisy
of the CbicftCO convention's expressions of
solicitude for working people, and the
nomination of tue Maine millionaire also
throws some light upon Bryan's conven
tion talk about pressing the "brow of
labor" with a "crown of thorns. 1 ' Mr.
?>wall, according to aJI accounts, is the
kind of a man that was referred to some
two thousand years ago in connection
with the eye of a needle. It appears that
tne Maine man has been in the habit of
pressing down "crowns of thorns" upon
tlie "brow of labor" all his life, as did his
father before him.
And Mr. Sewall must be pretty well
known in the world of labor as a tyrant of
a taskmaster, for out here in San Fran
cisco the Coast Seamen's Union had a very
full account of his inhuman treatment of
his sailors long before he was thought
of as a Vice-Presidential possibility. The
Seamen's Union got its facts from seamen
in tbe employ of Mr. Sewall, and the In
formation was made a matter of record for
the information of sailor-* generally Uiat
they might steer clear of the tyrant's
ships. la the ligut of Mr. Sewail's repu
tation for treating laboring men as if they
were lower than brutes there is seen an
inner meaning to Bryan's cry, "You shall
not press down upon tue brow of labor
this crown of thorns." A lawyer, of the
Bryan stamp no doubt, told his client that
they could not put him in jail. "But I
am in jail." "Yes, I know, but they can't
do it." Bryan says his partner shall not
press a crown of thorns upon the brow of
seamen, bat tbe pressing goes right ahead.
Unless Bryan is the most arrant hypocrite
alive be will make baste to demand the
withdrawal of Sewall from tbe ticket, and
make his own candidacy as the nominee
of his party contingent upon the substitu
tion of another man for Maine's million
aire enemy of honest labor.
BIMETALLISM AND SCIENCE.

Eastern edition of the San Francisco Ex-
uj/inirr, aunuuuicj in a uouDie-coiumn
editorial that it will support Bryan, but
the burden of the article is an apology for
the platform upon which its man is sup
posed to be making the race for President,
and to whose declaration of principles his
honor is pledged. Why the Journal should
apologize for tne platform when Mr. Bryan
says every word and every sentiment of it
is an inspiration, is a political mystery,
unless it is the purpose of the Journal's
manager to handicap its candidate by
showing the enormity of the crime against
the country that would be committed by
the practical application of the principles
he advocates. There appears to be many
of the characteristics of the snake when
charming a bird in the Journal's declara
tion that it will support tbe Chicago nom
inee.
Referring to tbe silver plank in the Chi
cago platform, which Bryan wrote himself
for the Nebraska-Demo-Popnlist Conven
tion of 1884, the Journal says: "It does not
deserve the fanatic vituperation leveled
against it. If its authors were mistaken
in their methods their aim was to intro
duce bimetallism." The Journal should
read the platform it alludes to. Now it
so happens that tbe word "bimetallism"
is not used at all in the money plank of
the Chicago declaration. In plain Eng
lish the platform declares for free-silver
coinage "without waiting for the aid or
consent of any other nation." Moreover,
it is intitrated at least that the silver dol
lar should be made tbe monetary unit of
value and tbe gold dollar adjusted to it.
The Journal's plea that the framers of the
platform were honestly mistaken; that
they did not mean to say what tne plat
form says, but that they were "providing
for bimetallism gives emphasis to the
charge of incomyetency which has been
made against the inventors of the docu
ment. Nevertheless, "without waiting for
the aid or consent of any other nation" is
and has been Mr. Bryan's chief hobby for
several years.
The Journal continues its defense of tha
stupidity pf the inventor of the coinage
plank by observing that "bimetallism is a
scientific theory, with too much expert
authority on Its side to brand its advo
cates as lunatics and Incendiaries." Tbat
is it exactly, although such a high com
pliment to the Republican platform's
money plank was not intended. The Re
publican party has insisted ail along that
"bimetallism" is a "scientific" question,
and it proposes to settle it upon scientific
lines. But the Journal's candidate, Mr.
Bryan, says it is not a scientific question
in any sense. It is simply a question of
Issuing a proclamation declaring that ''the
mints *re now open for the free and un
limited coinage of silver at the ratio of 16
to 1." No other country is to be con
sulted. The first notice the people of
other countries with whom we do an an
nual commercial business aggregating
nearly $2,000,000,000 are to have that we
have changed our monetary system must
reach them through the news columns of
newspapers. That is Mr. Bryan's plan;
but will the Journal indorse it as a "scien
tific" way which has the sanction of "ex
pert authority"?
The fact is, tbe Journal, like a good
many other of Bryan's supporters, wants
Bryan elected if his hands can be tied by
an anti-Bryan Congre3S. This the Journal
has already admitted. Nothing could be
more annoying to the business sensa of
the Journal than Bryan's unscientific way
of settling a scientific question by procla
mation. Like Joshua of old, Bryan would
command the sun to stand still if he
wantea a few more hours of daylight, but
the Journal knows that there are certain
scientific reasons why the sun would re
fuse to obey, Just as it knows tbat there
are scientific reasons why the commercial
world would only smilt at Bryan's com
mand to open the mints to the free and
unlimited coinage of silver without con
sulting commerce; and it is because tbe
Journal knows the smile of the commerce
of the world under such circumstances
would mean a declaration of war upon
America's commerce by every other na
tion that it is so solicitous about having
Bryan's hands safely tied by a Congress
that would stand for the kind of bimetal
lism the Republican party is pledged to
secure.
ABSOLVED DEMOCRATS.
It has always been the custom of the
Democratic party when under the con
demnation of the people to console itself
by remembering its traditions and its un
swerving loyalty to the principles of Jef
ferson, and not a little was the comfort it
derived from it all. But how low it must
have fallen, even in its own estimation,
when an ultra- Populistic newspaper like
the Denver Newt is constrained to say :
"To-day Is a greater day for Populism
than it is for Democracy. Democracy
should indeed rejoice. Tne Democratic
platform this year, save perhaps tbe sub
treasury matter, is a well-defined declara
tion of Populist principles. It Is glorious.
And as for Bryan, save for name, he is as
honest a Populat as lives." Democrats
hereabouts who have stood by theif party
through thick and thin and who were
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JULY 20, 1896.
always ready to fight for its principles
may be able to pick up a few crumbs of
comfort from what the ifaM says, but it is
doubtful.
It must be very distressing to the Dem
ocrat who is sincerely attached to bin
party to see it dominated by aliens and
strangers; a platform adopted tbat is not
Democratic, aud a leader selected who is
not even a Democrat in spots. But tbat is
the position the party is in to-day, so the
Denver JWt/s says, and, moreover, the
Htm says the transformation gives the old
party a very much loftier character and
nobler aims, even if it is retrograded to
the menial work of hewing wood and
drawing water for a party whose leaders
are Peffers, Altgelds, Waites ana Till
mans. But old-time Democrats know that
the Chicago convention's platform ab
solves them from allegiance to the candi
dates and principles of the "new Democ
racy," and candidate Bryan will find out
later ou that they are training in quite
another field of politics.
"THE SILENCE OF JUDGMENT."
It is claimed by the new leaders of tbe
Democracy that a great display of emo
tionalism and impulsiveness was needed
at Chicago to shake off the old barnacles.
If that is true, there was more method in
the hot-headed speeches that were made
than was suspected at the time. There
were superb oratorical efforts, no doubt,
and great excitement followed, but emo
tion in a political convention signifies
nothing. It is not the convention that
elects the President, nor does the enthu
siasm of a convention often last many
hours after it adjourns. In his speech
presenting Senator Sherman for candidacy
in the convention of 1880, Mr. Garfield
said: "Not here in this brilliant circle,
where 15,000 men and women are assem
bled, is the destiny of the republic de
creedânot in Chicago in the heat of June,
but in the sober quiet that comes between
now and the melancholy days of Novem
ber; in the silence of deliberate judgment
will the great question be settled."
The Democratic party hopes to keep
alive the emotionalism and enthusiasm of
certain acts of the Chicago convention and
have them grow and spread as the cam
paign progresses, but the scheme will fail.
In the first place the managers have over
rated Bryan's oratorical powers. They
measured him by a short speech, which he
had probably rehearsed lifty times, and
had woven into it every possible "stage
setting." But his short talks en route
from Chicago to his home in Nebraska
have lacked in grace, rhetoric and elo
quence, and it is by those speeches â
speeches tbat he may deliver as he rushes
over the country â that the people will
judge him, and not only so, but Bryan's
assertions will not be accepted by think
ing people as facts unless they are well
fortified by reasonable data. In the
"silence of deliberate judgment" is where
his oratory will avail him notuintr, and it
is there where the people settle all politi
cal questions.
Unfortunately for Bryan and the Demo
cratic party, tbe people have been sitting
too long in tha silence of idleness enforced
by tbat party and the ailence of America's
industries are appealing with too much
eloquence to be saved from Bryanism for
the boy orator to overcome the demand of
the people for protection and prosperity.
The people are terribly in earnest in their
purpose to re-establish those agencies
which conspire for their good, and oratory
which does not deal in facts and figures
and which does not demonstrate beyond
dispute will find that it will be no more
persuasive than the whistling wind. "In
the silence of deliberate judgment" of the
people it will go hard with the Democracy.
HAVE YOU REGISTERED?
Every Republican voter should know
that ha owes a duty to the community
and bis party which can be discharged in
no way other than by registering, so that
he may be qualified to help sustain the
cause of protection and prosperity. Those
who believe the advocates of free trade,
unsound money and other fallacious eco
nomic theories will not make a strong fight
to capture the law-making machinery of
the Government are making a grave mis
take. Never was the party of repudiation
and political heresies more active and de
termined. The leaders know tbat the ma
jority of every line of business and indus
try is overwhelmingly against them, but
they are counting on enough apathetic and
indifferent Republicans to give them the
majority at the polls, and it may be said
that they will not be counting without
their host if Republican voters do not at
tend to their registration duty.
It should be remembered, too, that
every day increases tbe difficulty of reach
ing the Registrar's office. So many defer
this Important matter from time to time,
until the question of getting an opportu
nity to register becomes a serious one.
No one who is physically able to reach
the City Hail has a valid excuse for stay
ing away; and should the election go the
wrone way because Republicans failed to
do their duty, it may truthfully be said of
them tbat they betrayed their party.
There is no doubt at all that the majority
of the people realize what a calamity to
the material welfare of this community a
Democratic victory would be, ana realiz
ing it there can be no excuse for not pro
viding against it by registering first,
working for the party second, and third
by voting straight for the men wbo stand
for prosperity thronghout all channels of
trade and traffic. The Republican who
willfully neglects to register is not loyal to
his party. ___________^__

The Los Angeles 7n rector remarks that "one
of the featnres of the local oil field at present
is the increase in the supply of natural gas.
This gas appears to be accumulating all the
time and it looks as if some of tbe wells might
be utilized for gas after they shall have ceased
producing oil. Several of the plants in the
field are now operated almost exclusively by
natuial-gas fuel. Possibly before long there
may be another competing gas company In
town, drawing its supply from the oil wells."
Tha Invettor opines that California will soon
surpass Pennsylvania as an oil-producing
State. It looks very much as If the opinion
would toon be borne out by facts.

power will be sold and conveyed to the mines
in Jhat vicinity, Browns Valley and other

The Summerland Advance informs us that
operations on a large scale are soon to be com
menced in the Summerland oil district. A big
deal is now on, providing for the shipment to
San Francisco of 10,000 barrelsâ 42o,ooo gal
lonsâ of crude petroleum weekly. Another
"spouter" has been struck there, and the oil
shoots thirty feet above the casing. In regard
to this new well, the Advance says;
"A few mornings since the men engaged in
drilling for H. L. Williams, at a depth of 173
feet, struck oil in such quantities that it
spouted thirty feet in the air from the mouth
of the well. As soon as the gas pressure was
relieved It subsided, however. The well is at
this writing belne sand-pumped, and is mak
ing a showing that delights tne heart of Mr.
Williams. The oil is of a higher gravity than
any heretofore struck In this vicinity.
"This strike is of more real Importance than
it shows on vhe face of it. All the wells bored
along the beach show that as they go farther
to the northwest the oil stratum gets closer to
the surface. There is quite a strip of terri
tory between Mr. Williams' wells and the
Moore wells that has not been tested, but all
oil men agree that the stratum reached by Mr.
Williams at a depth of fifty to eighty feet is
the same one struck further down at a depth
of 150 to 300 feet. Mr. Williams, In drilling
this well, penetrated tbe upper stratum and
went beneath it, piercing another deposit that
has heretofore only been surmised. It prom
ises to be a great thing for the oil industry,
and development of this well will be awaited
with considerable anxiety. It is the opinion
that it will flow forty or fifty barrels daily."

lar work on Japan, compiled by the
Jaranese themselves. He engaged the
services of thirty or forty Japanese
literary persona to furnish the descrip
tive material and employed artists to
make paintings on silk, to do fine lacquer
work and superfine lace embroidery, all of
which will be used in the first edition of the
work, which is iutended to reflect Japan as it
is. He also made a contract for 500,000 colored
photographs, Bxlo Inches, 250 of which will
be used In Illustrating each set of the books,
which will be in ten volumes. Something of
the elaborateness of the work may be Imagined
from the fact that $5000 will be charged for
each set in the first edition of fifty. The sec
ond ana third editions will be $1000 and
$250, but will not be so elaborately embellished
with hand painting and artistic work
manship. Captain F. Brlnkley, editor of
the Japan Mail, the leading English
paper of Japan, will be supervising editor.
The book will be reedy for the market about
next February.
AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
W. B. Maddock of Cheshire, England, son of
John Maddock of John Maddock <Â£ Sons, the
manufacturers of the celebrated earthenware
of that name, says that 800 men are employed
in the pottery works, which are located at
Bursiem. in Staffordshire. Farther than that'
he knows little about the factory, except that
his father founded the business fifty years ago.
He has visited the works but once, as all the
processes of mixing the clays and producing
the beautiful colorings and tints are secret.
Mr. Maddock spends his time in traveling far
from the business that attracted his father for
so many years.
"I have traveled a good bit," said, as he
â ucked at a small pipe that had evidently been
his favorite companion long before he hap
pened to be sitting in a comfortable chair in
the court of the Palace Hotel, "but I have
never seen a place that could equal Chicago
for bunko men. The tirst day I was there a
middle-aged man came up to me on Madison
street and said: 'How do you do, Mr. Maddock?
It's a pleasure to see you again.'
" 'Well, you bave the advantage of me,' I re
plied.
â¢' 'What, don't you remember me? Clarke's
my name, firm of Lewis â¢<& Clarke, New York;
came over on the Campania with you on the
10th. Why, we wero often in the smoking
room together. You remember the New York
merchant? Anyway, I'm glad to see you here.'
"Then he hurried on. Later in the day I
met him agAin. He hailed me and said:
â¢Doing anything? 1 find I have won a lottery
prize. Just going to cash it right near here.
Don't you want to come along and we'll have
a small bottle afterward to celebrate; first
time I ever won at one of these games.'
"Well, when we got in this office the agent
suggested that he try his luck for the next
drawing, but he said he wouldn't be in New
York on the dale it occurred.
" 'That's all right; have it right here,' said
the agent, and he got out a cloth marked off In
squares with numbers at the top and at the
sides, and each square markftl with so much
money or a star.
"The old gentleman bought his chance,
drew five cards from a pack and countea the
number of spots on three. The agent counted
those on the two and then ran his finger down
the column to the square opposite the first
sum. It was only a star. Again my com
panion tried, but got nothing. Then he drew
three cards and asked me to draw the other
two. The two I drew brought the $25 square
and the agent at once handed out the money.
"â¢I'll bank on your luce,' said the New
Yorker. 'Draw again.' We counted. The
agent ran his linger across the squaresâ $4000!
The merchant embraced me.
"The agent took two packages of bills out of
the drawer and placed them on the desk. Each
was marked $2000.
" 'You own half of it,' said my jubilant
friend.
'â¢ 'Wait,' said the affect. 'Welask only tbat
our patrons say a good word for the company;
that is our best advertisement. I would like
to take your names in order to attest our reli
ability. What is your name?' he aajted of the
merchant.
" 'Clarke, J. B.Clarke.'
" 'And your business, sir?'

TWO NEW SLEEVES.
There is little doubt but that sleeves are to
be close-fitting to above the elbow, atove which
there will be retained an appearance of width
by long puffs or voluminous drapery. The

AN OHIO MAN FOR PRESIDENT.
.Eugene V. Smaller In Review ot Reviews.
General Garflold used to account for the
great prominence of Ohio men in public life in
his time by saying that on the soil of Ohio met
and mingled the two best strains of American
bloodâ the Virginia strain and the New Eng
land strain. All signs in the political sky now
point to the election of McKinley in Novem
ber, and we may well ask ourselves: "What
sort of a President is this fifth son of Ohio, in
the list of twenty-four occupants of the White
House, likely to make?" The question is not
an enigma. The man has been eighteen years
in National politics, and for much of the time
a conspicuous figure; his character is an open
book, and Hs convictions on public issues ara
on record and may be read by all men. We
may expect from him a conservative, pure ad
ministration. I believe thfft it will be sturdily
American in its policy, for McKinley comes
from our great mid-continental plain, and is
not, like many men who live upon the Atlan
tic rim of the country, largely influenced by
European thought and example. McKinley
will unquestionably use the influence of his
position to restore to our tariff statutes the
principle of ample, scientific and symmetric
! cal protective duties.
* â¢ *
He will not, I ara confident, aim to make a
oiif-man power of the administration. Having
appointed a strong Cabinet, made up of repre
sentative men of his party, he will distribute
the duties and responsibilities of government
among them, as contemplated by the constitu
tion, and hold each Minister accountable for
the work in his own department. He will be
accessible to all men who have legitimate busi
ness with the Chief Magistrate, and he will
carry to the highest station in the land the
courtesy and dignity which he has unlailingly
displayed as a Congressman and a Governor.
He wOl be a harmonizer for his party, for
he has noue of the domineering temper and
stubborn egotism that breed political strife
and create personal antagonisms. Among the
early Presidents his prototype will be Madison,
and he will most resemble Hayes among our
later Presidents. He comes from the great,
sturdy, independent, moral and earnest Amer
ican middle class that forms the solid basis of
our whole political and social fabric.
WHAT WILLIES GOIN' TO BE.
When I grow up to be a man,
I know what I will beâ
I won't write poetry, like pa;
No, none of that for me!
A nd I won't clerk into a store,
Ncr keep books lv a bank,
Ncr be a bruit eruun on the cars,
To turn a iron crank.
And I won't go in politics,
To be like TJucle James,
And let the papers pick at me
And call me ugly names.
Bat there's a job that just suits me;
It's Dice and easÂ», and
When I grow up as big as pa
I'm goin' to join a band.
Then I can ride around through town,
In a trolley-car all day,
With signs and flaxs upoa it, and
.Not do a thing but play.

iness.
ONE VESSEL IS LOADING
She Is the William H. Macy
and Will Bring General
Merchandise.
ANOTHER EECORD BROKEN.
The Steamer China Beats Her Own
Time From Honolulu by Over
Two Hours.
ThÂ« fine American clipper ship William
H. Macy is now loading at New York for
San Francisco and will be the first of a
new line that will carry general merchan
dise from the Atlantic to the Pacific. She
will be followed by the A. J. Fuller from
Philadelphia, and thereafter vessels will
be put on the berth as often ts the traffic
will justifiy.
The new venture is fathered by Flint Â«fc
Co. of New York and J. F. Chapman &
Co. of this City will be the local agents.
Charles F. Flint is one of the most enter
prising men in the shipping business in
the United States. He has succeeded in
building up an enormous trade with South
America, and now he has enteredjinto the
contest for the Pacific Coast business.
Captain J. F. Chapman is one of the best
selections the New York concern could
have made in the matter of local agents.
He is a splendid business man and stands
ace high with every merchant in the
City.
The William H. Macy was built at
Camden, M?., in 1883 and is 2092 tons net
burden. Sh.e is 254 feet 9 inches long, 43
feet 2 inches broad and 28 feet 3 inches
deep. She may be expected here as the
pioneer in the Pacific clipper line about
next November.
Another ocean record has been broken,
and the Pacific Maii Company's China has
again demonstrated her speed. Several
months ago she made the run from Hono
lulu to San Francisco in 5 days 13 hours
and 19 minutes, thus establishing a new
record. Yesterday morning she completed
the same journey in 5 days 11 hours and 11
minutes, thus beating her own record by 2
hours and 8 minutes. The steamer's per
formance was a pplendid one, as she aver
aged 15 knots an hour between Yokohama
and Honolulu and 16 knots an hour be
tween Honolulu and San Francisco.
The China left Honolulu on the 13th
lnst. at 6:22 p. m. Daring the succeeding
eighteen hours she covered 288 knots. The
next day she made 37(5 knots, the next 3GS,
the next 37G, the next 370, and at 8 :04 a. m.
yesterday she finished her course of '2<Mi
nautical miles. The steamer's time from
Yokohama was 15 days 15 hours and 29
minutes, which establishes another record
from that port, and from Hongkong 24
days 7 hours and 6 minutes.
On the 15th inst. the China passed a
steamer about 6 p. it. She was so far
away, however, that there were no means
of making her out. The general opinion
is that the steamer was the Peking. The
Peking left here on the 11th inst. and she
was spoken in latitude 28 18 and longitude
14G 22, or 1332 miles from San Francisco
and 760 miles from Honolulu. If it was
the Peking, therefore, she must have
averaged over 13 knots from the time she
left San Francisco. She will have to do
better than that, however, to beat the
Australia.
The cabin passengers of the China were:
Dr. W. F. Arnold, Lieutenant A. Boutakoff
E. H. Bramwell, J. B. Castle, A. Collins, Cheong
Shu Cheong, W. D. Van Eck, Miss H. E. Fraser
and maid, Dr. S. G. Hill, Captain M. V. Lan
caster, P. Londolt, E. Learned, Miss L. Lewis
S. Maass, T. D. McKay, W. R. Mattebou, Mr.

Reid, U. Reuthe, Mrs. G. H. Stafford, Mrs. A.
Sharp, Alexander Sharp, Mrs. H. Stone, Mrs.
Thornton, Miss Thornton, Lieutenant 8.
Telaeff.
Among the steerage passengers were
two hunters, named Birch and Roach,
from the sealing schooner Jane Gray.
They got lost in the fog, but succeeded in
making land. The schooner had only
done fairly well when they left her.
A new steam launch for th 6 San Fran
cisco laundry was christened at Beedle's
Doatyard yesterday and in a few days she
will be plyins among the shipping. The
old boat used to break down once a week
on an average, and then Henry Petersen
would have to Bend the Amy out to search
for her. The new boat, however, will be
able to hold her own with anything in the
bay.
Returning from the launch "Charley"
Hansen and "Jim" Hartman began jok
ing Henry Petersen about being out of
condition and saying he would stand no
chance in a race with Hanlan. Henry im
mediately asked "Are you fellows in good
condition?" and they answered "Yes."
They were then a mile from the depot and
Peterson offered to give them 250 yards
start and nTn them to the train. For the
first half mile it waa a close race, but after
that Petersen had it all his own way. He
finished almost as fresh as at the start,
while Hanson hau to be carried into the
car and given restoratives before he was
able to walk around. Henry says he can
can get into condition inside of six weeks
to row the race of his life.
There was considerable movement in
shipping yesterday. The tramp steamer
Linlithgow went to Port Costa to load
wneat. and two British ships were towed
to McNear's by the Spreckela tugs. Sev
eral vessels were moved by Shipowners'
and Merchants' Tow boat Company, and
two vessels, wheat- laden, came down from
South Valiejo and -Port Costa.
The Blairmore was the great center of
attraction on the bay yesterday. Thousands
of people visited her. and half the sail and
rowboats on the bay were alongside.
Relic-hunters were so numerous that Cap
tain Burns had to place watchmen on
the decks in order to put a stop to the pil
fering. The work of cleaning up the ves
sel will begin to-day.
QUARTERLY RALLY.
Company IT, League of the Cross
Cadets, Entertain Their Friends
at St. Brendan's Hall.
Company H of the League of the Cross
Cadets held its regular quarterly rally
yesterday afternoon at 2 o'clock at St.
Brendan's Hall, corner of Fremont and
Harrison streets. The hall, which has a
seating capacity of about 400, was scarcely
sufficient to accommodate the crowd of
cadets and their friends.
Company H, which is next to the largest
company of the league, consists at present
of eighty-seren members, and is ably com
manded by Captain J. E. Power, First
Lieutenant L. Healy and Second Lieuten
ant Joseph Reagan. The company is
nearly two years old, having been organ

PLAYS AND OPERA.
What I* to Be Offered to the Patrons of
the Play-Houaes by the Managers
To- Night.
"Carmen" created such a furor at the
California during the past week that it has
been decided to continue it to-night and
during the balance of the wees. Ko-e
Coghlan and Frederick Warde have proven
a strong team in this production.
At the Columbia Theater the manace
ment announces for this evening "The
Two Escutcheons," a fascinating play that
has the power of fixing the attention of
the audience during the time tuat it is on
the stage. This is the larcwell week of
Maxine Elliott.
The popular Irish comedian, Emmet
Sheridan, will make his reappearance at
the Grand Opera-house this evening in the
leading role of an Irish comedy-drama, en
titled "Irish Inspirations." This will be
put on with fine scenic effects.
That romantic opera by Thomas,
"Mignon," is on the bill at the Tivoli
Opera-house. The title role will be as
sumed by Nina Bertmi-Humphreys and
Mme. Natali will appear as Filini, tue
actress. Tne character of "Wilhelm Meis
terwill'be impersonated by Sig. Miche
lena.
There will be a great attraction at the
Orpheum Music Hall to-night in the per
son of the great Biondi, who has the pecu
liar faculty of being able to present a
whole opera, he impersonating all the
characters. A number of other new fea
tures will be presented.
CHOOSING A QUEEN,
Plans Now Under Consideration
by the Carnival Com
mittee.
A Director-General Will Be Selected
This Afternoonâ Miss Elliott
on the Block.
Several plans for the election of the fes
tive officers of the carnival, the kings and
queens, will be presented at the meeting
of the executive committee this afternoon"
As the lady representing California will
be drawn from among those elected or ap
pearing as candidates at the interior fiestas
an estimate has been made of those from
whom to choose and the smallest estimate
the committee was able to arrive at was at
least 250 ladies.
A request has been made by a number
of school children in the City, who are
ambitious to preside over the festivities,
to open the ballot for the school children's
queen on the first Monday in August
when the schools will reopen. They ask
that the ballota be fixed at 5 cents apiece,
that they may come within their limited
means. Their request will probably be
acceded to.
Miss Maxine Elliott, who will auction
the- seats for the carnival benefit at the
Merchants' Exchange on Tuesday after
noon, is going to surprise the veteran
auctioneers in the City with the methods
which she will introauce to lure the dol
lars from the pockets of those attending
the sale. "
Miss Elliott has in process of elaboration
a scheme which sue is carefully guard
ing as a secret, and which she is satisfied
will be a striking novelty on the auction
block. Her many admirers in this City
propose to make the matinee on Wednes
day afternoon at the Columbia Theater,
which is her last appearance, an occasion
for showing their appreciation of her
efforts, and at the same time assisting the
carnival fund.
The election for carnival directors will
be held this afternoon. There are several
applicants whose well-known energy will
enable them to pull the carnival throuch
in excellent style.
One important point that the parade
committee has discovered is that no float
exceeding twenty feet in height can be
paraded on the streets of San Francisco
crossed by electric trolley lines. This in
formation is very important, as many
organizations are already preparing de
signs for their floats, and considerable
damage would be done to them if they
should come in contact with the heavy
wires of the electric roads.

Japanese Colonization Company to
Buy 300,000 Acres in Mexico
for Cotton.
A special Commissioner from the Gov
ernment of Japan arrived here yesterday
to study the prospects for the extension
| of commerce by Japanese steamship lines
, to Mexican, Central American and South
American ports on the Pacific Coast, and
also to consider the advisability of secur
ing cotton from thÃ South, kerosene from
Pennsylvania and Eastern-made ma-
I chinery directly through San Diego for
\ transportation to Japan by one of the sev
| eral prospective steamship lines.
With the Government agent is a repre
sentative of the Japanese Colonization
Company, which purposes now, through
these two men, to consummate the pur
chase of 300,000 acres in the State of
Chiapas, in the southwestern part of
Mexico.
This tract of land is owned by the Mexi
can Government, and can be bought, the
Japanese Commissioner thinks, ior $1 an
acre, Mexican money. The idea is to di
vide it up into small sections of twenty
acres and assign a section to each Japan
ese family. Some coolies will be em
ployed, but the main purpose is to intro
duce family life and Encourage the colony
to cultivate coffee, cotton, tobacco and
sugar. Particular attention will be given
to raising cotton in this Tehuan tepee
colony, as the manufacture of cotton
goods has become one of Â£he greatest in
dnstries of Japan.
T. Kusakado, the agent of the coloniza
tion company, does not speak English
fluently, as this i 3 his nrst visit to
America, but his companion, Sho Nemoto,
the special Government Commissioner, is
a graduate of the University of Vermont
and has been in America several times
since he finished collejie, over fifteen years !
ago. Upon him the burden of the conver- |
sation fell when it came to explaining
their mission to this country.
"We get a great deal of cotton from ,
Bombay," said he, "but the fiber is not
firm enough, and from such cotton we can
not make the best goods. Our best cotton
has always come from the South in the j
United States. We cousider that the best
in tlie world.
"From this colony we hope to get !
cheaper cotton for our factories. At
present we import no cotton from Mexico,
only from the United States. Our own
people raise some, but not nearly enough
to supply the demand.
"This colonization company has existed
five years, but t>o far it hus only been in
vestigating. Three times it has examined
Mexican property, and now it is about
ready to buy. The payments would ex
tend over a period of fifteen years.
"No; there has been no tadk of buying
lana iv the United States. One reason is
it is too high, and another reason is your
laws prohibit contract labor.
"My business is the investigation of the
commercial industry in Mexico, Central
America, Peru and Cnilu. We want to
learn what the commercial prospects are
for Japan at the ports of those countries,
not only in shipping our goods but in im
porting for own markets. At the same
time I shall not neglect the United States,
which is the best friend we have. Here
we purchase all our kerosene, much ma
chinery and large quantities of cottou.
"While my investigations are not for the
steamship lines, the information Lhope to
obtain will guide in a measure the action
of luture Parliaments in subsidizing new
steamship companies. All the steamship
companies are private corporations.
"The act for the subsidizing of private
steamship lines passed our Parliament last
year.
"Already there is s subsidized line to
Antwerp with steamers running regularly
since May by *ay of the Suez Canal, the
Mediterranean and Liverpool. Then there
are to be other new lines to Singapore,
Australia, Seattle, Mexico and one to
New York by way of the Straka of
Magellen. The last, however, is not quite
decided upon.
"The Yusen Kaisi.a, the largest steam
ship company of Japan, will run to Seat
tle about one steamer a month, 1 believe,
although that is not definite. The line
will begin operations in six months.
"Another company will have charge of
the line to Tehuantepec. Just when that
line will be started 1 cannot say. Its
steamers will touch at San Diego and Aca
pulco, and possibly even further south to
other Central American ports. Later a
line may be started to South American
ports.
"We wish to stop at San Diego in order
to get cotton from the South, machinery
and kerosene from the East and products
from the West Indias by a more direct
route.
"There is no idea of competition nor
will rates be put down for that purpose.
Janan simply wants to handle her own
commerce in a cheaper way."
Mr. Xemoto and Mr. Jvusakado are at
the Occidental, where they will stay dur
ing their short visit here. After their in
vestigations are completed they will re
turn to this City.
CHRISTIAN ENDEAVOR.
Rev. William Rader Tells His Congre
gation of the Great Convention
in Washington.
Rev. William Rader, pastor of the Third
Congregational Church, who recently re
turned from Washington, D. C, where he
attended the fifteenth annual convention
of the Young People's Societies of Chris
tian Endeavor, spoke to his congregation
last evening of the great convention. He
spoke of the gathering of representatives
of every State in the Union and from the
provinces of Canada, and in glowing, elo
quent language described the scenes he
witnessed in the capital of the Nation, and
stated that the feeling on all sides was
strong for holding the Christian Endeavor
convention in San Francisco in the year
1897. The convention, he said, is an ex
pensive one, and the one held in Wash
ington had cost something like $25,000,
and added that that amount has already
been pledged for tnis City.
The pastor spoke of the effect the con
vention had on the people and how it
awakened them to a spiritual duty, sayins
tnat all of the twenty-two churches in
which services were held were crowded to
excess.
POISON IN A CAT'S BITE,
One of the Rare Cases Treated
at the Receiving Hos
pital.
Charles Huist, a Restaurant Keeper,
in a High Fever and His Hand
Bad'y Swollen.
It is not unusual for cases of dog bite to
be treated at the Receiving Hospital, but
cases of catbite are very rare indeed. The
first in several years was registered at the
hospital yesterday morning.
Charles Hurst, 15 John street, is part
owner of a restaurant at 39 Market street.
He had a nice cat in his house that was a
terror to rats and mice. The restaurant
was plagued with rodents, so Hurst de
cided Saturday night to give pussy a
cban c at them.
He dumped her into a sack and walked
with her through by-streets till he reached
the restaurant. The cat resented being
shut up in a sack and made her voice
beard all the way. She made ineffectual
efforts to get out of the sack, and when
Hurst got to bis restaurant the perspira
tion was pouring from every pore in his
body.
He laid the sack down on the floor of
the restaurant and happened to place his
left hand on the cat's head. Instantly
pussy's teeth were inserted deeply |n bis
hand through the sack and he yelled with
the pain. The cat dfshed out of the sack
and mode thines lively for a few minutes
till she got familiarized with her new sur
roundings.
Hurst tenderly nursed his wounded
hand, which soon began to swell. He
could Qot sleep a wink all night from the
pain and yesterday morning he went to
the hospital. Dr. Helms found the hand
very badly swollen and the inflammation
had extended up to his elbow. Hurst was
also in a hich fever, the poison from the
cat's teeth having got in its work.
Dr. Helms tnoruunhly cleaned out the
wound, painted it with iodine and dressed
it. He also gave Hurst a prescription to
cool his fever. No evil effects are ex
pected, but if Hurst had delayed much
longer in having the wound attended to
the consequences might have been seri
ous.
SMOKED CHICKEN.
A "Black" Fire in Chinatown Causes
Annoyance to the Department.
What is termed a "black" fire by the de
partment occurred at 7'do]4 Washington
street yesterday shortly after 1 o ciock.
When the engines arrived the men
found the place full of smoke, with an ex
ciied crowd of Mongolians running about
in confusion.
The place was occupied by Sun Lee Sara
as a poultry, risk and vegetable store. The
damage, which amounted to about $300,
was principally caus-d by smoke and
water. 8o dense was the volume of sti
fling smoke that several of the firemen
were partially overcome.
After one hour's hard work the fire was
extinguished, leaving in its path a quan
tity of smoked chickens, clams, dried
mackerel and seasoned cabbage leaves.
Nearly Lost ills Ear.
Julius Pulkmer, a roomer in the Overland
House, Sacramento street, nearly lost his left
ear early yesterday morning. He was stand
ing in the hailway opposite his bedroom tak
ing off bis shoes before retiring, and as he was
rat he r unsteady on his legs, he gave a lurch
and fell over the bannister to the floor below,
striking on his left ear. He was taken to the
Receiving Hospital in the ambulance and Dr.
Fltzgibbon had a delicate job in sewing on the
ear, which was hanging by a shred. It was all
saved except a small piece.

Papers for Woman's

Stand.
FROM OREGON TO SAN DIEGO.
A Tidal Wave of Praise and of Declar

When Susan B. Anthony said Saturday
night at the Republican ratification meet
ing that 200 newspapers of California
had followed, in tho wake of The Call's
movement toward the National recogni
tion of woman stiff age, she did not by any
means exaggerate the number. In fact,
as Mrs. A. A. Sargent said yesterday, there
are more than 200 papers that have
come out strong editorially complimenting
the advanced stand taken by The Call,
and declaring their own policy hereafter
to be favorable to the recognition of the
rights of women.
Mrs. Ada B. Harper, secretary of the
California Woman's Suffrage Association,
has made a point of recording the names
of the papers whose editorials have de
clared for woman's emancipation. Among
them are the following :

"The Call," said Mra. Harper yester
day, "may take to itself unlimited credit
for being the nrst to come so nobly to the
front. It has made a niche in history for
itself, and the reward will oe one of those
perennial rewards that are never quite
paid, bat always enjoyed. The Call
dropped a golden stone into the ocean of
popular opinion regarding this move

ton and the lateral streets have suffered tÂ«
a considerable extent at the bands of dex
trous petty thieves. So light-fingered
and clever were the thieves in their work
that they baffled detection in their steal
ings for some time. The discovery did
not come until several drugstores in cerÂ«
tain parts of the City were in great danget
of being buried beneath an avalanche ol
old hats, second and first hand books, ar
ticles of hardware and household utensils,
in fact, goods of all descriptions that did
not happen to be redhot and bolted to the
floor at the time the pale-faced piiferera
successfully accomplished their raids.
In most instances the druggists whose
stores were selected for temporary junJi
shops were asked to take goods several
hundred times the value in exchange foi
10 cents' worth of morphine. How many
trades of the kind were made it is difficull
to estimate, though certain it is that thÂ«
glassy eye and pin-head pupils have been
much in evidence in some localities for the
last few days. It is probable, however,
that only a small portion of the stolen
foods were disposed of in this manner,
he second-hand dealers were called into

tained money for other things besides theii

dollars would not cover theloss sustained

Grand Recorder D. S. Hlrshberg returned from

and In relation to classified assessments adopted
by the supreme body, be says:
"'I he legislation adopted at the Supreme Lodge
of the A. v. U. W., which closed its session on the
26th of June, was perhaps the most important in
the history of the order. .Many of the representa- j
tives came to the session with their minds folly
made up to vote against a change of plan, but
after the exhaustive and convincing report of the
beneficial commission was presented It became
plain that the recommendations of the committee '
wi-re based upon the actual experience of the \
or'.er. and that the proposed change would put the |
n in-prosperous jurisdictions upon a sound, perma
nent and enduring basis, and would also Inject
them with the element of competition which, in
view of their present assessments, did not exist.
"The table of rates has heretofore been publisned
in The (.'am. These rates range from 60 cents
to $1 78 for a $1000 certificate and 91 20 to $3 56
for a $2000 certificate, the rates to be applied to
members at their atta ned ages at the time they
are put into operation in each jurisdiction, a mem
ber to advance from a- lower o the next higher
group, groups being as follows: 18 to 24; 25 to
29; 30 to 34: 85 to 39; 40 to 44; 45 to 49; 60 to
54; 55 and over.
â¢ -The rates are known as classified and not as
they are frequently referred to. graded rates.
Graded rates contemplate a rate of assessment at
the age of entry which remains the same through
life A classified rate is a rate which advances
with advancing age and is based upon the mortu
ary ex perieuce of that age or class of uges. ~
i â¢â¢And in the plan adopted by the A. O U. W. the
advance Is made every rive years up to 55, when
it ceases and remains the same thereafter.
â¢â¢Under the new plan no juris lie lon will be en
titled to relief, whether operating under classified
assessments or not, until they levy a number of
. assessments equal to twelve assessments under
the classified plan."

The Degree of Honor. â¢'. -T/ ;
Superior Chief of Honor Ginevra Llnton Miller
has issued a circular, In which she explains the
object of the institution of the Superior Lodge.
She says:
, "The object of the Supreme Lodge, A. O. U. W.,
in instituting the superior Lodge, Degree of Honor,
was to place its mauasemfnt entirely under the
control of its own members (members of the de
â¢ gree), and as far as practicable put the affairs of
â¢ this branch of the order into the hands of the
ladies of Workman's homes, for whose benefit the
degree was designed."
' i Den she addÂ»: â¢â¢Social interest in subordinate
lodge meetings and In such informal occasions us
1 lodges may arrange for the benefit of themselves,
and their friends is of the highest value. The
lodge best .does it) work which best provides for
â  the entertainment of Its members at its meetings
and secures for itself the test standing as a social
factor and as a source of enjoyable social events In
tbe community. Tils kind of work I would earn
es Iv commend to every subordinate lodge, and
urge upon the grand officers that they stimulate it
to the fullest extent. Let there be an entertaining
programme for each meeting, and an earnest effort
to en. lst outside friends in the membership.
i "The beneficiary feature of the order must not be
overlooked In Its social pleasures. This is the rock

Mr. Palmer was then introduced.

said, "when ont from chaotic darkness

Tbe Son of God arose out of tbe East and

the reefs and shoals. The iron ship that
keeps well to sea can breast the waves at
any time, but woe to the ship that comes
shoreward.
"I want to tell you that because you
have seen an A. P. A. standing up for the

ments of Monsignor Saiolli wben he was
representing the Pope on this coast."
The speaker then read extracts from
Catholic writings which he bela were a
clear enunciation of the right of the
spiritual ruler to control temporal affairs
and the superiority of ecclesiastical of
ficers from the operation of civil law.
"This law," he continued, "maintains
that the temporal law is under the spirit
ual law. It is said in the canonical law
that if the temp oral law goes wrong it is
to be judged by tbe spiritual courts. By
this law when tne civil courts l-o wrong,
according to the ecclesiastical idea;*, the
decisions are to be reviewed and revised.
This law affects our most vital principles.
"Our country to-day is boiling like a
caldron, but amid all the confusion of
this bour the American people will still
have their eyes on the treachery of Rome,
â¢nd in the great spelling match of next
November will relegate ncr to the foot of
the class.
"I never attacked my fellowmen as
Catholics, but 1 am attacking the princi
ples of the hierarchy. 1 want to tell you
that the principles of tbe Roman Catholic
hierarchy are rotten to th"c core and they
can never be reconciled with the princi
ples of the American Republic. There
may be schisms in the A. P. A., but there
will never be^enougb schisms to divide us.
We may be broken again and again, but
we will come together again. I believe in
the A. P. A. because I believe the great
majority of the men in the organization
are clean men. I have faith in the A. P.
A. because Father Yorke or anyone else
can turn tne Roentgen ray upon the live 3
of nine-tenths of us and we will welcome
it and turn it back again.
"All over the country the Roman Catho
lics are trying to pnt tbe children in the
parochial schools, but they can't do it.
The great masses of Roman Catholics will
gaze upon the American statute of liberty
and, by the grace of God, they will
straighten themselves and stand erect.
This day let every man do his duty.
"Let business and reputation go to the
wind, but you do your duty, sir, and God
will put a crown ufton your brow. I be
lieve Jebovah has never forsaken this in
fant Nation, and I believe he will feed the
child until it shall stand a mighty man
among the nations."

Oakland Office Fan Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, July 19. |
It would pay the Alameda County Su
pervisors to offer a prise for the best soiu
tion of the value of a street- railroad fran
chise. The question has been raised at
each of the annual sessions of the Board
o! Equalization since Assessor Dalton was
elected, and is still ieopardizing the
chances of the present board to succeed
itself. During the past week tbe public
have been taught many iessons aud have
been regaled with many sidelights on the
vexed subject of equalization of railroad
property. Four distinct methods of j
assessing have been shown. There is Mr.
Morehouse's unique method, the details
of which are known only to himself, and j
which the Supervisors and Assessor do not '
yet comprehend, although they have it
"under advisement." The only man who
fully understands and agrees with Mr.
Morehouse is E. Black Ryaa of the South
ern Pacific. Mr. Morehouse thinks Mr.
Ryan's idea of the law as bearing on as
sessments is perfect; Mr. Ryan shows the
utmost respect for the San Leandro
banker, ana hints that he is a model
assessor.
Tben comes Mr. Dalton's method of
valuation. lie seems to have arrived at
the conclusion that the genuine value of
railroad property is about three times the
amount sent in by the corporation, and
acts accordingly.
The Supervisors have a method of their
own of arriving at values, but so far they
have not taken the public into their con
fidence.
Lastly, conies tbe method of fixing
values as presented by the corporations
themseves. One street railroad company j
asks that its franchise be assessed for the \
amount it paid for it, a mere bagatelle.
To this Mr. Dalton replied that the best
criterion of value was that put upon it by j
the company when it placed its bonds on i
the market. To an ordinary individual
this seems very reasonable, but to Super- i
visor TaJcott it was intolerable, and the
Assessor was not beard further. The peo- [
pie who did not vote for Mr. Talcott made
a note of his expression of protection for
the road that runs through his district,
and he will have a chance to answer when
he goes before tne electors again.
For a whole week the Board of Equaliza
tion has heard the views of the various
parties and to-morrow it must decide as
between Dalton and the figures furnished j
by corporations. It is not an easy task, I
nor one to be devoutly wished for. To re
duce the assessments will be to court tbe
denouncement of an "indignation" meet* j
ing; to sustain Dalton will lose them the ,
influence of the push. If the Supervisors ''
believe in the efficacy ot prayer, mighty â 
must be their efforts to seek superhuman
wisdom this fine Sabbath.
As the streetcar lines of Oakland are all
running at a loss it is only reasonable to ;
â uppose that they would be anxious to ;
avoid damage suits, which occasionally j
run into line figures. They are all losing
money, for their representatives before i
tbe Board of Equalization said so during
the past week. Tney continue to kill peo
ple through carelessness and to disobey
safety ordinances and to pay heavy judg
ments. This is a state of affairs vbat
would be ludicrous if it were not true.
The only reasonable assumption is that
the roads are not losing money and that it
is cheaper to kill a few people than to
obey the law.
A matter was being discussed on Broad
way yesterday that has a direct bearing
on a state of affairs not uncommon in this I
city. Two messenger boys were approach
ing their head offices, and, when on the
corner of the block, they rode their wheels
a few yards on the sidewalk so that they
oould alight at the door. An energetic
policeman saw them %md succeeded in
arresting one of the boys. When at the
police station he was "induced" to tell
who Ml companion was that had escaped.
A minute later police headquarters tele
phoned to tbe messenger office that if the
other boy did not come up and pay $2
fine the patrol wagon would be sent for
him. The poor boy went to the City Hall
and paid half his week's salary for a crime
that he was not even convicted of.
Within a blocK of the same office ordi
nances are broken a hundred times a day,
and not one arrest has ever been made.
Tbe ordinance relates to streetcars stop
ping on crosswalks and passing each
other within fifty feet of a crossing. The
latter ordinance was passed out of respect
to public opinion, after two little girls had
been cru illy mangled one evening through
carelessness. The penalty in either case
is $200, but not once has such an amount
gone into the city treasury.
One of tbe men who were discussing the
matter said, "Why should the employes
of street magnates iike If. M. Smith and
the Southern Pacific Company be pro
tected when a boy is promptly arrested
for a paltry little offense that hurts no
body?"
Why, indeed?
The subject has caused much discussion
and the public are at a loss to know why
the uniformed gentlemen who parade the
streets do not know their whole duty, and
if they know it why they do not perform
it. Nearly every day there is a serious
runaway in the center of the city. It is
nearly always caused by an unhitched
horse taking fright. Yet scores of loose
teams ure left on the street every day
although there is an ordinance prohibiting
it. His very commendable to arrest Ohi
nege gamblers and school children who
violate the sidewalk ordinance, but it is
also well not to ignore those measures
Which are of much greater imporUncoand 1 1
which were expressly designed to save
human life and limbs.
The sentiments expressed in this col
nmn last week seem to have had weight.
There was no meeting held at the Taber
nacle to "stiffen up" the Supervisors in
regard to assessments. When they have
acted the people who have voted them to
office have a perfect right to hold meet
ings and either commend or condemn
them. To do either prematurely would
be as indecent as for the citizens of San
Francisco to have held a mass meeting to
terrorize tbe Durrant jury into rendering
a verdict of guilty while the trial was in
progress. Messrs. Friend, Aldrich and
Aaron D. Bretz are to be congratulated on
changing their minds. Sober second
thoughts are often best for people who ex
pect to go before the voters at election
time. Stuart W. Booth.
A FATAL EXAMPLE.
Mollie Traynor Seeks Death by the
Same Method as Mrs.
.Levy.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 19.-The suicide
of Mollie Traynor, who ended her life
early this morning, was caused by the
suicide of Mrs. Levy. When the Traynor
girl heard of Mrs. Levy's suicide she said
to her companions, "That's the way I
shall go."
Within a weet Mollie had carried out
her threat. She was tbe same age as her
example; used tbe same drug and
purchased it at tbe same store.
Mollie Traynor had a most unenviable
record, having been in the County Jail or
the City Prison or the Receivine Hospital
for several years. In nearly all of her
troubles she hes appeared with a char
acter known asEdthe Marks, to whom it
is believed s-he was married. The Salva
tion Army took her in hand once and
Mollie behaved herself for a few months,
but outside influence was too strong and
Mollie went from bad to worse. She was
only 22 years of age.
Eddie Marks, who was the companion
of Mollie Traynor in all her trouble, is at
present serving a short term in tne County
Jail. When told of the girl's death to-day
be was greatly affected, as when the pair
were sober they showed much affection
for each other. Jailer Lane accompanied
Marks to tbe morgue and allowed him to
take a final look at tbe suicide. In her
room was found some correspondence be
| tween herself and Marks that plainly
i showed the girl intended committing sui
cide. She was of the very lowest class of
women and her career has been one of the
speediest to reach its end that tbe police
can recollect.
DR, JEFFERSON ARRIVES,
He Will Be President of the
New Berkeley Bible
Seminary.
He Is Much Pleased With the Outlook
for a Successful Opening of
the Term.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jnlv 19.â Dr. 8. M. j
Jefferson, who is to take charge of the j
! Berkeley Bible Seminary to be established
j by tbe Disciples or Christians of Cali
fornia in affiliated relation with the State
University, has arrived in Berkeley, and is
| preparing to complete the preparations ,'
I necessary lor the beginning of the work.
! He is stopping for tbe present with his
v. ife and three children at the home oi
y. rs. P.i rk nu rst on the corner of Chan ni ng
way and Dana street.
The seminary will open in August
simultaneously with the opening of the
State University. It will be in every sense
a strictly theological school when per
fected, and will be patterned largely after
the seminary at Bethany College from j
which Dr. Jefferson rome?.
"The details respecting the courses of
study to be offered.^ 1 said Dr. Jefferson to
day "will be made public within a short
j time. In the meanwhile it might be said
in general that a critical and complete
theological course, such as is usually of
| fered in theological seminaries. A more
I popular course will also be offered.
"For the present only temporary quarters
! for the convenience of students will be se
! cured, awaiting a more complete develop
ment of our plans.
"Tbe prospect of the work here is most
flattering. About $100,000 endowment has
already been secured and it is hoped tbat
i at no distant day we will be able to erect
j a theological hall near the university
; grounds and in the style of architecture in
| harmony with the university buildings.
"Our denomination is steadily growing in
{ California, and in accordance with the ra
pidity of growth here we will be able to
progress with our work.
"As a religious body the Disciples num
ber nearly a million in the United States.
According to the last census we are cred
ited with having over 900,000. Their rate
of increase during the last ten years has
been 82 per cent, or larger than any other
religious body in the United States. In
California, however, we have not more
than 20,000 adhersnts.
"Berkeley is an ideal site for such an in
stitution as our3is to be, because of its be
ing the site of the State University and
because of its proximity to tue large
| churches and libraries and lecture halls of
I San Francisco. We have come to stay
| and to me the prospects of success are
flattering in the extreme."
Dr. Jefferson is a graduate of tbe Indi
ana State University, having taken the
highest honors of bis class. He finished
his course iv 1874 with the degree A. B.
and subsequently received the degrees A.
M. and LL- D. from Bethany College, West
Virginia. He spent nearly twenty years
in the pastorate of the Christian Church.
During the iaÂ»t three years he has been
Professor of Biblical .Literature and Doc
trine in Bethany College, tbe oldest school
of the Disciples, which was founded by
Alexander Campbell. He gave up his
position in Bethany College to assume the
presidency of the Pacific Coast institution.
Slay Not Go Kagt.
BERKELEY, Cal., July 19.â Reports
have been current for tbe past three or
four days tbat Professor Bernard Moses,
head of the department of history at the
State University, would probably Boon
give up his position at Berkeley to accept
a simi'ar one at the University of Chicago.
Interviews with several of his most inti
mate friends at the University to-day
failed to establish any foundation for the
rumor, further th*n that be had been
aslcod to accept a position at Chicago. He
is now giving a course of lectures in his
specialty there, together with twenty or
thirty other professors from vaiaous uni
versities, in America and Europe. He
will return to Berkeley in time to take
up bis regular work iv August, from all
that can be learned.
Took Oil of Tansy.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 19.â Eddie Hinds
took enough oil of tansy to-night to fatally
poison two men. Eddie is a lad about 13
years c:dv and this evening* he and his
brother were discussing; the recent sui
cides by poison. The brother dared Eddie
to empty the bottle in which was about
half an ounce of the poison. ,He also bet
5 cents " on . bis brother's . failure . to do so.
Eddie drank the oil of tansy and was soon
in great pain. He was taken to the Re
ceiving Hospital and Dr. Hamlin worked
for two hours before the boy was out of
danger.

A THIRTEEN YEARS' WAR,
It Has Resulted in Many Vic
tories for the Salvation
Army.
Celebrating Their Anniversary at the
Trestle Glen Camp-
Meeting.
Oakland Office San Feancibco Call.)
908 Broadway, July 19. \
Tbe Salvationists are celebrating the
thirteenth anniversary of the inauguration
of their work on the Pacific Coast.
In the city of tents at Trestle Glen there
is fust one of the original members of the
day. He is Ensign "Father" Boyden,
who was the. hero of a true story in the
Sunday Call of threo weeks aeo, in which
be figured as the eater of 10,000 beefsteaks.
"In those times the fighting was hard,
said Father Boyden. "We had to fight
everybody and everything. The devil was
not even the worst of our enemies. We
had to fight the newspapers, the churches
and the police. Everybody thought we
were cranks and nobody had any con
fidence in us. We had no property, no
standing and nothing but grit.
"I remember the first time we changed
our headquarters. It did not take us lone
or give us much trouble. I carried our
transparency, somebody else carried the
drum, another the torches and another
the remnant of a can of coal oil. , During
our first year, though, we did some Rood
work and laid the foundation for the great
army on the coast to-day." .
Several references were made to-day to
the progress of the army in thirteen years.

THROUGH A SEWER
NOT A PICNIC,
Councilman Bassett's Log
of a Voyage Under
the City.
THE LAKE TO THE BAY.
Microbes and Side Sewers Add
to the Prevailing Dis
comfort.
A GREAT MANT DISCOVERIES.
" Old Pard â  Is Now Convinced That
tbe Slain Lake Sewer Needs
Cleaning.
â 
Oakland Office Saw Fbakcisco Caw,,)
908 Broadway, July 19. f
Councilman Bussett made the voyage of
his life yesterday. It was two miles in
length and through, the main lake sewer
that carries two-thirds of the sewage of
Oakland to th > bay.
Tbe venerable Councilman's trip was the
result of a bluff. City Engineer Wilson
sustained Street Superintendent Miller's
demand for |500 to clean the big sewer.
Mr. Bassett was opposed to it. He recom
mended that the Board of Works, of which
Wilson is a member, ro through the
sewer. Wilson said he would go if Bas
sett would join them. As Mr. Bassett is
exempt from paying poll tax Wilson
thought he was safe.
But Mr. Bassett called him down and
took him up.
The company was afterward increased
and the crew that started on the trip were
Councilman "Old Pard" Bar-sett, Ciiy j
Engineer Wilson, Veterinary Inspector
Tierce and Teddy Joost, nead of the sewer
Hushing gang.
Mr. Basset t took copious notes and com
piled the following log of the voyage:
We had some difficulty in getting our boat
below the ttouii gate, and only succeeded by
tilling tbe boat with water and pushing it
under the raised gate. We were pretty well
covered with oilciotb coats and hats and rub
ber boots. We took the disinfectant inter
nally. Our primary idea was that by letting
in a full head of \vatt-r we should move rap
idly along with the rushing current. The plan
wan not a success. Tbe flood so filled up the
sewer as to leave no room above for tbe boat
and passengers. We hailed the first man-hole
and ordered the flood gate closed. Soon the
water lowered and we moved slower but more
comfortably. The connecting .sewers from the
different streets threw in sufficient wat<T to
float our float. Some ofnhese side pipes enter
the main sewer so high as to make shower
baths of irequent occurrence to a boating
party.
Superintendent Miller, with several of his
men, haUed us as we passed the different man
holes. For a long distance this main sewer Is
from twenty to thirty-three feet below tbe
street grade. Under the pilotage of Teddy we
moved along at a r-perd of about a mile an
hour, and two noun and a quarter from the
time of starting we shot out into the bay at
West Oakland.
Tbe trip is easily made. There is no danger
attending it, except from asphyxiation or
being drowned like rats in a hole from the
possible clogging of the sewer. When we
started from Lake* Merritt the air was bad, so
bad that I doubted our being able to stand it,
| but as tbe dratigtt began to reach us from the
uncovered man-holes breathing became easier
and during the last half of the voyage there
was plenty of fresh air.
This main lake sewer is a splendid piece of
work. From Lake Merritt down to Adeline
street it is solid concrete, and though we saw
occasional small cracks in the wall it is upon
the whole a solid, substantial structure. It
has a fall of two feet in two miles. No more
fall can be had.
From Adeline street to the mouth this sewer
Is constructed of wood. The planking is uuite
rotten and in the near future the concrete
must be extended from Adeline street to the
bay. This is something that should be looked
after very soon. City Engineer Wilson says
this sewer now carries the sewage of two
thirds of the city.
From tbe head of the sewer down to Market
street there is lrom six inches to one foot of
obstruction. This is, for the most part, black
mud and fine sand which has formed against
the base of gravel, rock and pieces of cement
thrown into the main sewer from the connect
ing sewers. There are seven or eight of these
bars of heavy material. If they are taken out
1 think the flue sand and mud can easily be
removed by flushing from Lake Merritt. I
think Superintendent Miller cun make a i?ood
Job of It at a cost oj #300 to $400. This sewer
was last cleaned about six years ago. From
Market street to its mouth the sewer Is en
tirely free from mud or sand or gravel ob
struction.
REALTY MARKET REVIEW,
A Better Demand for Country
Lands Looked For This
Fall.
But Few Transactions Recorded Last
Weekâ Building and Other
Notes.
The market remains very dull in the matter
of actual transactions. Dealers report an im
proved inquiry, but it Is an Inquiry not easy
to satisfy, the demand being largely for invest
ments yielding 6 per cent or more per annum,
net. The tax question still cuta a figure in the
market and will until it is definitely settled.
Many dealers who make a specialty ot band
ling country property report a considerable in
crease in inquiry for country lands, and as
prices on this class of property have declined
materially during the past two or three years
it is thought that indications are favorable for
a considerable increase in tne sales this fall of
farm and fruit lauds.
REVIEW OF THJS RECORDS.
Tbe past week has been another light one In
the number and amounts of transactions re
corded. There were but seventy-four transfers
recorded during the week.
The number of mortgages recorded was sev
enty-five, aggregating $102,258. Only one
was for a rreater sum than $10,000. It was
for $12,000, end was given to Bertha Brittan
for five years at 10 per cent on property on the
northwest corner of Bluxome street, 275 feet
northeast of Sixth, nortneasi 137 :Â«5, northwest
125, southeast 112 :6,norihwest 125, eoutUwest
25 and southeast USU.
The number of releases granted was thirty
seven, aggregating $91,05*1. They were all for
small amounts.
There were sixteen contracts recorded dur
ing the week, pledging an outlay of $57,250.
The details were as usual published in The
Call at the time of tiling. Tbe principal con
tract of the number was given by the Spring
Valley Water Company to the Raymond Gran
ite Company for $24,000, it being for the gran
ite work upon the new building now being
erected at the corner of Stockton and Geary
streets by tbe water company.

find many opportunities for placing money
just now to good advantage.
Jacob Heyman has just placed upon the mar

division. It will be offered at very reasonable
prices, the minimum being $20 per acre.
The stone iront of the new Hobart building
on Post street near Stockton is all up and pre
sents a very handsome appearance. Stone Is
coming more into favor in this City for build
ing purposes each year and its use in the cou
struction of the facades of prominent build
ings is a vast attraction to the City's archi
tecture. Of other prominent buildings now
underway that are to be built of stone is the
building being erected on the site of the old
American Exchange hotel, the new ferry depot
and the new Call building. The latter is to
be faced on all four sides with stone so that the
structure will present the same appearance
from whichever side it is viewed. This will be
a novel injovation in San Francisco in the
construction of commercial buildings.

THE SHELLS WILL FLY,
Light Artillery Target Firing on
the Santa Cruz
Field.
First Infantry Testing the New Army
R fle at the Presidio
Range.
The summer practice of heavy artillery
at the Presidio is not completed. When
dummy projectiles are received General
Graham will resume practice at the dyna
mite battery. These projectiles should
correspond in weight and size to the reg
ular dynamite cartridges.
Practice with the twelve-inch rifles on
the bluff above Fort Point will take place
as soon as suitable powder can be pro
vided. Lieutenant Lissak recently tested
a lot of powder from the Santa Cruz
works.
The June practice with the heavy euns
at Alcatraz and the Presidio and the ex
periments in firing shells from the mortar
battery were highly gratifying.
The two light batteiies of the Fifth Ar
tillery, commanded respectively by Cap
tain Frank Thorp and Captain Charles
Morris, will practice at Santa Cruz this
week. Major Edward Field, Second Ar
tillery, who was recently appointed in
spector of artillery, staff of Brigadier-
General Forsyth, will superintend the an
nual practice of the light batteries. He
went to Monterey a few days ago in obedi
ence to orders from department headquar
ters. He was authorized to select the
Santa Cruz range if in his judgment it
should be found superior to the range at
Monterey. Advices have been received
saying that he found at the Santa Cruz
field superior advantages for long-range
practice* and also adaptability for quick
maneuvering to nre at short or intermedi
ate distances.
Explosive shells are to be used in the
target practice. Proper care will be ob
served to keep spectators outside of the
zone of dispersion. Major Field is a sym
pathetic man, as well as a gallant soldier,
and it would surely grieve him deeply if
the fragments of a shell should knock
over a summer girl at Santa Cruz. The
acceptable range at Santa Cruz is adjacent
to the ground occupied by the National
Guard in the summer encampment of 1893.
It is near the scene of the memorable en
gagement known as Tripe Hill.
The companies of the First U nited States
Infantry at Angel Island and Benicia have
very nearly finished annual target prac
tice with the new United States Army
rifle. Captain John J. O'Connell, Company
E, came over from Angel island last Mon
day. Last Saturday Captain Charles G.
Starr's Company Q went to the range.
There is quite a difference of opinion
among enlisted men as well as among
commissioned officers as to the shooting
qualities of the new rifle. Some of the
army veterans are not willing to admit
that the new gun is the equal of the old
Springfield rifle. For accuracy in firing the
old-style rifle is highly praised.
The experiments with the new rifle (the
Krag-Jorgensen), made under the direc
tion of ex-Surgeon-Generai Griffiths of the
Kansas National Guard at Fort Riley, are
attracting wide attention. The penetrat
ing power of the jacketed bullet fired from
this rifle is almost incredible. At ten
yards from the muzzle of the rifle the bul
let penetrated twenty-four inches of well
seasoned white oak. At 200 yards it went
through forty- five poplar planks, each one
inch thick and one inch apart. At 2000
yards it perforated a horse's body at the
shoulders, and at the same distance passed
through three human bodies. At 2800
yards it perforated four inches of deal
plank, and at two miles it retained suffi
cient velocity to penetrate the human
body.
There yet remains the important ques
tion whether the bullet possesses the
"stopping" power by which an army is
instantly disabled. What little experi
ence has been had with it would indicate
that as at present constructed the small
caliber jacketed bullet does not inflict the
temporary "knock-out" blow that follows
even the simple wound made by bullets of
larger diameter. A remedy for this defect
is now engaging the attention of ordnance
experts.
An officer of the Fifth Artillery who
participated in several of the great battles
of the Civil \Var holds that the facility for
rapid firing which the new rifle affords
will cause the soldiers in battle to fire a
prodigious quantity of ammunition. He
cites the fact that it was quite a task to
keep the engaged infantry supplied with
ammunition when the muzzle-loading
guns were used. Now when it is possible
for a soldier to fire away in twenty min
utes as much ammunition as be could
conveniently use with the muzzle-loader
in two hours the waste will be surprising.
Leave of absence for one month has
been granted to Major A. E. Bates, chief
paymaster of the department. Major
Bates left the City for the East last Satur
day. He will visit bis family on the
Massachusetts seashore.
Lieutenant-Coionel William Bindair,
Fifth Artillery, has gone to Yosemite
Valley on fourteen day? leave of absence.
Leave of absence for fifteen days has
been granted to First Lieutenant Albert
C. Blunt, Fifth Artillery.
Among the assignments of this year's

pigsKin a joyful flush overspread the feat
ures of these officials, hiding momentarily
from view the unrivaled collection of
freckels with which the managerial coun
tenance is adorned. The secretary of the
league shook hands with the owner of the
San Francisco Club, tne keeper of the grand
stand congratulated the club's manager
and the auditor of passes hugged the
maker of the schedule so vigorously as to
cause the startled reporters to wonder
what was the matter with Mr. Blake, for
Bake, like tne illustrious "Poobab," com
bines in his person these many officials
"all roiled into one." "Foobah" Biake
was happy. The joy of victory has not
oiten been vouchsafed him, and for his
Dets to down tne mighty Oaklands was an
unexpected pleasure.
Tne game was in itself a remarkable
one. Nine runs were scored, not one of
which was earned. Both pitchers were
wonderfully effective, and had either re
ceived good support would have shut out
his opponent. Russell was, however, a
bit uncertain and made three wild pitches.
Agnew, the Oakland catcher, was also
erratic, having four passed balls to his
credit. His slowness in recovering the
ball was responsible for the scoring of at
least one of San Francisco's tallies.
Tne visitors got two men around the
circuit in the second inning. Keating got
to first on Eber't eror, stoU second and
went to third on Agnew's hit. Agnew
also stole second, and in the effort to head
him off the ball was thrown wildly and
bot . Keating and Agnew crossed the plate.
That was all the runs the Oaklands got,
but tne local men managed to score several
times. In the third inning Eber tallied
on two errors and two stolen bases and in
the nfth Levy and Krug crossed the
rubber. Levy was hit by a pitched ball,
went to third in Krug's hit and both he
and Krug scored on Walters' error.
In tha seventh Sweeney and Murphy
got around on a base on" balls, O'Neill's
error, a passed ball and Iberg'a single.
The last runs of the game were registered
in the eighth by Levy and Smith on two
bases on balls, a will pitch and a single.
Of the Oaklands Agnow made the only
good showing at the bat, but his sleepy
work otherwise more than counter-bal
anced this.

PACIFICS THE WINNERS.
They Administer a Sound Drub
bing to the Erratic Call
fornias.
The Pacifies administered a sound drub
bing to the Californias at Presidio Athletic
Park yesterday. Except in one inning the
vanquished were unable to connect with
the ball to any extent. Then, three safe
hits and a couple of errors netted tire runs.
The features of the game were Mona
han's home fun in the opening inninj?,
and the general play of the Pacifies'
Pitcher McCarthy was very effective, while
Chase was rather wild.

SAN JOSE DEFEATED.
Both Sides Played Good Ball, but
the Local Men's Stick Work
Won.
STOCKTON, Cal., July 19.â There was
a large crowd at Goodwater Grove to-day
to witness the defeat of the San Jose ball
tossers at the hands of the Stockton nine.
Both sides played good ball at times, bat
the local men were too bandy with the
stick and made five runs in the first inn
ing, while the visitors retired with noth
ing to their credit. They evened matters
up somewhat in the second, and three
men came over the plate, while Stockton
was shutout. From this on the game was
all Stockton's. Lockhead, Pace and little
"Babe" White did some fine work at the
bat and "White played a great game at sec
ond.
De Costa was in better form than he was
last Sunday, and it was hard for the visi
tors to find him. Delmas of San Jose
managed to connect with the sphere in the
sixth inning and lined it oat for a home
run. Pace, Stockton's catcher and star
player, hit Doyle . for h three-bagger
amid the cheers of the crowd. McCarthy,
San Jose's center-fielder, did some good
base-stealiner, and altogether the game
was a good one. in spite of the large score.
The runs by innings were as follows:

The Emmettl Won.
The game of baseball between the Em
mets and Buttes at the Midwinter
grounds yesterday was lively as long as it
lasted. The fine pitching and batting of
Hubbert and Buyia won for them The ap
plause of the spectators. The Emmets
were declared the winners by a score of 7
to 5. An invitation from the winning
team to any of the teams of the First In
fantry Regiment will be cheerfully ac
cepted through William Hart ol Company

LEWIS EMANUEL
PASSES AWAY,
His Death Brought on by
Shock From a
Fire.
HIS STRANGE SEIZURE.
Was Senior Member of the
West Coast Furniture
Company.
A PIONEER MANUFACTURER.
He Left His Office Thursday Feeling
111 and Soon Alter Became
Unconscious.
Lewis Emanuel, senior member of the
West Coast Furniture Company, died at
his residence, 1916 Pacific avenue, last
Saturday after a brief illness, in which he
sank rapidly to the end. His death was a
shock to his numerous friends, for Mr.
Emanuel had to all appearances enjoyed
perfect health and was cut off almost sud
denly in bis prime. At his bedside he was
surrounded by his family, who saw death
approach, while he lay there unconscious
for days beyond the power of medical
skill t* even delay the last moment.
So far as the attending physicians know
his was a singular case. They agreed that
the direct cause of death was spinal men
ingitis, but this condition was brought
about by a severe mental shock and sub
sequent nervous strain.
On the night of July 8 a disastrous fire
swept the West Coast Furniture Com
pany's factory on Fourth street, and
destroyed half the building and its
contents. The following Thursday Mr.
Emanuel went to the factory and sadly
contemplated the ruin about him. He
carried little or no insurance, for the
reason that the risk was not Kindly re
garded by insurence men, and the rate
was excessive. And so the loss was almost
complete.
Several times before fire has visited his
furniture works and he suffered heavily
thereby. This one proved a crushing
blow, so it is said, and it completely over
came the senior member of the firm. That
Thursday in the afternoon he complained
of feeling ill and went home. He went to
bed at once and almost immediately be
came unconscious. One of his oldest
friends stated last night that the shock
caused by the tire affected him and it was
believed brought on the attack whi^h
proved fatal. This view was taken, as Mr.
Emanuel had always been hale and hearty
until then He never recovered enough to
regain consciousness, and in this state he
died Saturday.
The strain on his nervous system was so
intense and so sudden that it paralyzed his
brain and through the spinal cord caused
his death.
The deceased was the pioneer manu
facturer of furniture in San Francisco.
He was a native of London, England,
where he was born sixty-seven years ago.
Throughout his career in this City he was
favorably known in the mercantile and
manufacturing communities. Though suc
cessful in his business he was particularly
unfortunat â  through losses by fire at dif
ferent occasions.
No employer was more generally loved
by his men than Mr. Emanuel. It was
said of him yesterday that in all the labor
troubles and strikes which reached his
works an amicable settlement with the
men was invariably made. He harbored
no feeling of ill-will for workmen who left
his shop on strike, but took them back
again and treated with them on friendly

Those who knew him best say he was
kind-hearted and generous to a fault, a
true friend and a lovable father and hus
band. In private as well as in public
charities lie was always ready to respond
to calls for assistance. Outside of his own
family nobody regrets his death more
than the men employed in the West Coast
factory. They sent a beautiful floral piece
to grace his bier, as a token of their love
and esteem.

MAGUIRE RETURNS.
Talks of the National Situation and
the Single-Tax Campaign in
Delaware.
Congressman Maguire returned yester
day morning by way of the Northern Pa
citic route from Chicago, where he took a
very prominent part in the Democratic
Convention, especially in connection with
the anti-funding bill plank, which was
adopted largely through his efforts. While
at Chicago Judge Maguire corresponded
daily with The Call and his concise and
pithy summaries of the convention news
constituted a feature of the unexcelled
report mrnished to the paper's readers.
Although Maguire did not pet so far
East as Delaware he learned some inter
esting facts about the campaign the *ingle
taiers are carrying on in that State. "All
the leading Democrats of Delaware," he
declared, "with the exception of Senator
Gray, have expressed an earnest desire
that something should be speedily dene to
bring the singie-taxers in Delaware to the
support of tiie Democratic ticket."
Congressman Maguire is naturally con
fident of Democratic succiss in November
and believes that Bryan will be elected.
In the Congressman's opinion the silver
men and a majority of the Populists will
indorse the eloquent Nebraskan. In re
gard to the recent Democratic convention
he declared that although the majority
were very determined they were perfectly
orderly. "It was a great convention," he
concluded, "and it will compare very
favorably with the other conventions in
t.c political history of this country."
SLASHED BY A BRUTAL SON.
Mrs. Tracey Seriously Cat on the Face
Yesterday Afternoon.
Mrs. Tracey, who resides at 1186 Harri
son street, was seriously cat on the face by
her son, Edward F. Tracey, a bookbinder
by occupation, yesterday afternoon.
Tracey went to hit home early in the aft
ernoon under the influence of liquor. His
mother made some remark regarding his
condition, whereupon be dretv a knife and
slashed her across the nose and cheek.
Tracey then left the house.
Tne police were notified, and Officers
John Lyman and H. O'Day were detailed
on the case. They searched for Tracey for
several hours, finally learning that he had
returned to his home. They went to the
house and placed him und*-r arrest. He
was taken to the Southern Police Station
and detained on a charge of assault with
a deadly weapon.
WOMEN WHO GO BOATING
It Is the Fad to Row on Stow
Lake Around Strawberry
Hill.
Attractions at the Park and the Beach.
Scenic Railwaysâ A Big Dog That
Shoots the Chutes.
' There is one section of Golden Gate Park
that is frequented by a large number of
people who are fond of healthful exercise,
and that is Stow Lake, that beautiful arti
ficial sheet of water around Strawberry
Hill. It is remarkable that within the
past two months the majority of the vis
itors are of the gentler sex who wish to try
their skill as oarswomen.
Yesterday there were quite a number of
ladies in the beautiful boats, some feather
ing their oars with the skill of the
beEt boatmen. There were others who
labored hard at the oars, but they man
aged to get around all the same, reaching
the landing with a ruddy glow upon their
faces, showing that a pull around the
island was invieorating exercise.
"You would be astonished,'' said Louis
J. Ohnimus, who has charge of the boat
house and boats, "what interest the ladies
of this City are taking in boating. They
come in the forenoon when the weather is
clear and there is not much wind, and
they have a glorious time. The number
of visitors has been increased on week
days, now that the steamcars stop at
Strawberry Hill station going to and com
ing from the beach."
A gang of men is at work now clearing
away the weeds which grow in the bottom
of the lake, and by this means the water
is kept from obstructions which might in
terfere with the working of the oars.
The Zoo in the Park has had another
increase during the past week. This time
it is another buffalo, but like the one born
there a few weeks since, he was hidden in
the brush in the paddock and couid not
be seen by the thousands who made a
journey to the paddock.
John L. Bardwell has donated to the
museum a collection of President's
medals in bronze, each having on the
obverse a profile of one of the Presidents,
from Washington to Cleveland. These
are issued by the parent mint and this
series is the only one west of the Rocky
Mountains. He has also contributed some
rare bronzes from a Buddhist temple that
were cast in the sixteenth century.
Many people who were not in "the park
were at the ocean beach and around
"Sutroville by the Sea" with its many at
tractions. The new scenic railway was in
operation and the little cars were crowded
all day with people anxious to feel the
effects of a ride on an uneven track.
Sutrovilie is soon to have new attrac
tions, patterned after those at some of the
Eastern seasides. One will be a three
story merry-go-round and the other a
mechanical contrivance known as "the
wave motion." Persons seated in cars are
tossed about as if they were riding on suc
ceed mc waves.
In the baths Colonel Robinson offered
to the patrons a number of races in the
tank and a game of water polo, all of
which created a great deal of enthusiasm.
l In the long race there were twelve entries
j and the winner was George Hinkel. In
the rifty-yard race for boys, A. Hem won
the first prize. The California Swimming
I Club.which was recently reorganized, gave
some splendid exhiDitions of high diving.
At a meeting of the cluja yesterday Mayor
Sutro was made an honorary member."
An immense number of people, who had
done the park and the beach, went to the
Haight-street grounds to witness the an
nounced balloon ascension and take in
as well the scenic railway and other at
tractions there. The balloon went up, but
Robert Earlston, the aeronaut, did not.
| He had provided his own balloon, but it
was minus the usual hand-holds. When
the sphere was inflated and ready to be
I released, the men ahd boys holding it were
unable to hold on and it tore away from
them and at the same time tore out the
top at the place where the supporting rope
held it by a ring. The people were disap
pointed and Earlston was out the amount
I he wou:d have received for making the as-
I cension.
The performance in the Casino attracted
a ereat portion of the visitors.
Every Sunday for a month past a gen
tleman has visited the grounds, accom
panied by a large dog of the St. Bernard
species. This animal has developed a fond
ness for shooting the chutes. As soon as
he enters the grounds he rushes up the
steps leading to the platform from which
are started the cars that carry people to
the highest elevation, and he barks'until
his master comes and takes him through
the gate. He in time takes his place in
one of the boats and shoots the chutes,
and this he repeats from fifteen to twenty
times in an afternoon. â¢ A week ago yes
terday the animal was taken into the
haunted swing. That was too much for
him, and he became very sick.

ANNUAL OUTING
OF THE BUTCHERS,
Tenth Picnic of the Pacific
Coast Protective As
sociation.
HELD AT SHELL MOUND.
Racing, Bowling and Dancing
the Principal Events Used
to Kill Time.
WAB VOTED A GRAND SUCCESS.
The San Francisco Lodge is the Oldest
in the Order â Prominent
People Present
The journeymen butchers entertained
their friends in right royal style at Shell
Mound .Park yesterday, the occasion be
ing their tenth annual celebration. From
ThÂ« FÂ«t Men's Race as Seen by a "Call" Artist at Shell Mound Park Yesterday.
early morn till near the midnight hour the
beautiful pleasure resort was thronged
with merry-makers.
The day's programme included races of
such a varied character as to include
every one who thought kindly of his or
her tleetness of foot. There were races for
boys and girls of tender years, for married
men and mothers with young babes, for
bachelors and spinsters, fat men and
women, people with no superfluous flesh
to speak of, boss butchers and committee
men. For those who could not run races
bowling was provided, and for such as did
not care for either of these two sports the'
dancing pavilion was open. The little
children, and there were hundreds on
hand, found happiness in the swings or
merry-go-round with its melancholy
music.
Nearly everybody who is anybody
among the journeymen butchers at
tended the outing. Auditor Broderick,
wi.o in early days found the meat busi
ness profitable, came c arly and stayed
late. His Honor, Judge Campbell,
brought his whiskers and was the center
of an admiring throng as long as he
stayed. The Judge claims to have been
a butcher in Oregon, but it was whispered
yesterday that his knowledge of butcher
ing is of the "Deanut" order.
Several hundred people were gathered
in the grand stand, when the committee on
games, consisting of Morris Marx, Ben
Burnett, George Hanna of San i'ranci-co,
H. Audiffred, A. Hamilton and James
Stephens of Oakland, called for the first
raceâ an event for boys under 12. Then
came another for young girls and then the
married ladies were given a chance. In
all twelve races were run, affording in
tense amusement and excitement for the
spectators. The races and winners are as
follows:
Race for boyÂ« under 12â Lewis Hasaesilebach
first, Thurston Pierce second.
Race for girls under lii â Katy Logue first,
Katy Barry second.
Cash boys' raceâ Joe BuUivan first, William
Berble second.
Married ladiesâ Mrs. Conroy first. Mrs
Brown second.
Young men's raceâ Charlie Tye first, C
Ledgett second.
Single ladies' raceâ Annie Botch first, Katy
Goslund second.
For metobersâ Frank Barron first, J. R. Rich
ardson second.
For fat ladiesâ Mrs. Lynch first, Mrs. Kearny
second.
For fat men over 200 poundsâ Tom Nolan
first, R. C. Kelly second.
For girl* under 12â Emma Lohr first, Annie
McDonaugb second.
For married meuâ William Mitchell first, M.
Schweitzer second.
For boss butchersâ Monroe Schweitzer first,
A. Blum second.
The prizes were all valuable and suit
able to the particular event. For instance,
the first prize in the boys' race was a fine
straw hat, while the winner of the fat
men's event received a live gallon keg of
beer.
The picnic committee was as follows:
Charles Rusineer (chairman), Morris
Marx, R. C. Kelly, Henry T. Schwab
(secretary), George A.bhaoe.William Red
dick, G. T. Lohr, J. Rickford, Ben Bar
teis, T. Ford and Gus Roner.
The two dancing pavilions were crowded
to their utmost capacity throughout the
day. The following gentlemen were in
charge: Floor manager (for lower pavil
ion), Fred Kratt; assistant floor manager,
Ben Oswald; floor com mittee â A. yon Grig
linjier, E. Ansell, C. Ohrne, J. Stutt.
Foor manager (upper pavilion), Frank
Krauer; floor committee â Fred Getz
Ralph Asher, C. Weiaheimer, Fred Meyer.
It is estimated tuat 2000 people attended
the tenth annual picnic of the Journey
men Butcher's Protective and Benevolent
Association, and not one of this vast
throng but was willing to vote the occa
sion a splendid success. It was a quiet,
orderly affair except for the merry-mak
ing. To Ben Davis is due much of the
success of the picnic.
Pavers Are Indignant.
A meeting ot the I'avers' Union was held
last evening and resolutions were passed con
demning an article published in a morning
paper reflecting upon the work done by the
pavers. The criticism of George W . Elder, In
tne same article, caused great indignation on
the part of the members of the union, who
claim to be competent workmen and equal to
any that can be found.
A SUSPECTED LEPER.
Consternation Created by Henry Grimm
at the City and County Hospi
tal.
The attendants at the City and County
Hospital have been alarmed again over
the sudden appearance among them of
what seemed to be a leper.
Last Thursday Henry Grimm, laborer,
18 years of age, walked into the hospital,
sat down upon a bench and saiu he was
sick and wished to be treated. He did not
know what was the matter with him, but
had nodules upon tne back of his right
nand, resemb ling tubercular deposits. He
was also identified as the brother of Lena
Grimm, the young eirl who was sent from
the hospital to the Pestbouse lately for
leprosy.
The physicians, in view of these facts,
sent the man to an isolated room and, as
ne was epileptic and wandering in bis
mind, locked him in, so as to prevent his
escape and to guard against any possibility
of contagion should the case turn out to be
lept*>sy.
cv Â°^ Brien i the City physician. Dr.
btanle, Dr. Dudley and Dr. Martinez, who
have examined the patient, say that he
has not any symptoms of leprosy. The
akin elevations noon the back of the hand
and wrist have now almost wholly disap
peared, and are said to have resulted from
a rash.
Grimm, who is evidently half-witted.
Tel ' 8 many contradictory tales of himself
and his sickness. Last night he was much
better, and in a day or two. Dr. Dudley
the resident physician, thinks he will be
discharged.
CYCLERS ON A PICNIC,
Joint Annual Run of the Asso
ciated Clubs Held at
San Mateo.
A Large Attendance and a Good
Timeâ Bay City Wheelmen
Will Parade.
The annual picnic run of the California
Associated Cycling Clubs was held yester
day at Coyote Point Ueach, near San Mateo.
The start was made at a little after 9
o'clock from Twenty-second and Folsom
streets, the route followed being the bay
and Ban Bruno road. Arriving at the
beach about noon the riders found lunch
awaiting them in a grore of trees. Most
of the wheelme n took a dip in the bay be
fore lunch, which proved very refreshing
after the ride.
A large number of riders from the clubs
of this City, Oakland and San Jose at
tended the run. ,After lunch some started
at once to return, others visited the Crys
tal Springs dam, while a few continued on
to Palo Alto.
The run was voted a big success, and all
who attended had plenty to eat and drink
and a good time generally. The arrange
ments of the affair were in the hands of
the inter-club relations committee of the
association, composed of W. O. Johnson,
C. J. Leighton and H. W. Spalding.
What has become of the cycling clubs'
baseball league, about which so much was
written in a morning paper a while ago?
The dates given on the schedule for sev
eral games have long since passed, but
the games have not been played as yet.
Manager Ravi in should arrange a new
schedule and get the thing started again.
The Garden City Cyclers will hold a roof
garden party on top of their clubhouse
next Friday evening.
r. W. Fuller, George H. Stratton and
John F. McGlynn of the Olympic Club
Wheelmen returned Saturday from their
three weeks' outing in Lake County. They
had a splendid time, and came back well
tanned and high in spirits. McGlynn
grew a lull beard while away and is so
changed that his friends will hardly know
him.
The Bay City Wheelmen are so thor
oughly enthused over the big cycle parade
of next Saturday night that a special
meeting of members has been caHed for
this evening to arrange the details for
tiieir division. They will have their own
band of music, and floats and banners
galore, and expect to have nearly every
member of tne club in line.
lhe Eintracht Cyclers rode to Hay wards
yesterday under Captain Frank, and the

KELLY AND BARRY
HECK AND NECK,
The Contest for Congress
Is Very Hot and
Spirited.
BOTH SIDES CONFIDENT.
Result of a Caucus in the Mills
Building Last
Night
CLTTNIE'S FRIENDS SAW WOOD.
Democrats Discuss the Possibilities of
To-day's Fight in Redwood
City.
Friends of General Thomas J. Clunie
candidate for Congress in the Fifth dis
trict, are not saying much, but are ap
parently not a whit disturbed by the
"shouting" of opposing candidates.
A number of James H. Barry's friends
met last evening to confer in regard to his
candidacy. While the result of last night's
deliberations were not announced, Editor
Barry's friends all seem very confident as
to the outcome of to-day's session of the
Fifth district convention at Redwood
City.
Barry is stated not to have done any
thing himself toward securing the nomi
nation. But if the nomination is ten
dered him he says he will accept it as a
matter of duty and wiil conduct a vigor
ous campaign. Both in the convention
and, if nominated, in the campaign Barry
will doubtless encounter determined op
position.
It is claimed by his friends that if not
nominated on the first ballot Barry may
be named in the second, as many of the
delegates who are pledged to Clunie and
Kelly have expressed their determination
to break for Barry after the first ballot.
Among Barry's prominent supporters are
Senator White and Congressman Maguire.
"Of course I am for Barry," said the lat
ter last night. "I am for Barry as against
anybody. He has been my warm personal
friend ever since we were boys. lam sat
isfied that il nominated he will poll a
strong non-partisan vote and that he
would lose fewer Democratic votes than
either of his opponents. If he is the nom
inee of the convention he will undoubtedly
be elected."
Interest bordering on anxiety was mani
fested by "the push" over the proceedings
at the Barry caucus. Though held on the
eighth floor of the Mills building, the
meeting-place was an open secret early
last night, and some of" Buckley's spies
were in attendance â outside the keyhole.
At a time when loud talking inside caught
the ears of the watchful henchman in the
lobbies a shadow was observed through
the glass door. It was stooping very low
for a full grown man's outline, so the door
was opened quicKly, and thÂ» n Bob Coch
rane, brother of "Colonel Joseph" Coch
rane, was seen backing away from the
door.
"I'll go out and see who it is," said Max
Popper. "I know the push, pretty nearly
all of them," ami Max followed the re
treating fi. ure round a corner of the hall
way.
"Hello, Bob, what are you doing here?"
"Looking for the office of Joe Howard,
the collector."
"Why. he was hanged at Folsom last
week," Popper replied.
Healy Davis was met downstairs. Being
a recognized member of "the push"â the
Rainey-Buckley-Lanigan rank and file
he was given the glassy eye.
"We've got you." jeered one of the dele
gates with a wave of his hand, and Davis
made a remark.
Immediately after the caucus quite a
large number of interested Democrats met
at their headquarters in the Flood build
ing. Many of them were curious to know
what bad been done in favor of Barry and
all were eager for news that might afford
a forecast of to-day's strugglejat Redwood
City. There was but little difference of
opinion, but then it was apparent that
most of those present were Barry men.
Max Popper stated that Bfwry had
thirty votes in San Francisco and "every
thing depended on Santa Clara for victory.
However, he had received encouraging ad
vices from San Jose and deolared that
Barry's chances were excellent. Eugene
Deuprey will nominate Barry and Patrick
Reddy will second the nomination.
Kelly's friends were positive that they
held a plurality of the votes, and conse
quently did not fear either Clunie or
Barry. At the Democratic headquarters
it was stated that all delegates employed
in the United States Mint had been in
structbd to support Kelly.
In some quarters it was considered of
good augury for Ciunie that his name was
not ieverishly "shouted." His excellent
record and freedom from "strings." it was
held, made him especially the man for the
emergency. He was regarded as a strong
"dark horse" for first place. Mr. Clunie
will be placed in nomination by D. M.
Delmas.
Julius Kahn has declared that if Kelly
and Loud are nominated on the Demo
cratic and Republican tickets respectively
he will run as an independent candidate.
Mayor Sutro, when shown the list of
possible candidates for Representatives
Irom the Fifth District oi California,
shook his head and said, "None of them
very strong," and in answer to a question
said : "No, I shall not be a candidate for
Representative, nor would 1 be a candidate
for United States Senator even."
CHINATOWN EXCITED
Over the Arrival of the Recently
Elected President of the Ning
Yung Association.
A ripple of excitement has been in mo
tion, since last Friday, in the official and
business circles of Chinatown. Distin
guished strangers, dressed in long, .loose,
flowing silk robes have been walking
around th- principal streets, to the great
apparent delight of the admiring specta
tors.
It was learned upon inquiry that Wong
Chick, the recently elected president of
the Nintt Yung Associatien, had arrived
from China and formally assumed the
duties of his office. In company with Lee
Mon Hoy, the retiring president, and In
spector Tom Sing, he has* been making of
ficial visits to the Chinese Consul, the Six
Companies and the merchants of the Ning
Yung Association.
President Chick is a man of high rankâ
the second degreeâ and is both rich and
respectable. His visit to the Consul will
be formally returned to-day. A great part
of his time yesterday was "spent in calling
upon the numerous merchants of his asso
ciation and in being introduced to them
by bis predecessor. In their robes of
black and yellow silk and official hats the
Chinese dignitaries presented a pictur
esque and dignified appearance.
lhe Ning Yung Association has in this
City alone some 6000 members, of whom
about 150 are merchants. Lee Foo Gar,
who was lately chosen secretary of the as
sociation, is now on his way to this City
from China. J

MiLK TO BE QUARANTINED
Ban to Be Placed on Thirty-
Eight Cows of One
Herd To-Day.
Proprietors Appeal for a Second
Test Before Forty Cattle
Are Killed.
The Swiss Alpine Dairy is on the verge
of having thirty-eight cows and two bulls
infected with tuberculosis utterly annihi
lated. These cattle are worth $1600. This
dairy is out on the San Bruno road.
Preliminary to the killing of the cattle
Milk Inspector Dockery will go out to the
dairy this morning and quarantine the
milk from the thirty-eight cows. He will
not allow a drop of it to be brought to the
City, much less sold.
Following this the Milk Inspector, in
connection with the Board of Health, will
make a systematic inspection of all dairies
and a thorough test of all cows in this
county. He says that tuberculosis among
cows and other domestic animals is on the
increase in this country and the outlook is
that a large number of cows worth thou
sands of dollars will be destroyed. Should
a test among the cows of San Francisco
County show a wide prevalence of tuber
culosis or pneumonia or other contagious
disease tne inspection of cows all over the
State will doubtless follow.
There are about fifty-eight cows in the
Swi*s Alpine dairy. The owners, Messrs.
Baumann & Baumann, were instructed to
have a veterinary surgeon present at the
inspection. Thinking that they might
lose only three or four cows out of the
herd they did not employ a veterinary.
When the result of the test showed that
forty of the herd were infected and had
been ordered killed by the Board of Health
Messrs. Baumann & Baumann appealed
for another test of the cows. The Board
of Heaith and Milk Inspector Dockery
now has this under consideration.
CLASSES AND MASSES.
Evolution Into Heaven Barred by the
Statutc> of Wickedness.
The Rev. Dr. Dille does not believe that
evolution will take a bad man into the
kingdom of heaven, or that evolution will
cure the ills of a corrupt and wicked
nation.
"Slavery in the South was not cured by
evolution," said he last night. "It :>ad to
be cut out with the Nation's sharp sword.
Polygamy in Utah was not stopped by tne
process of evolution; enactments of law
had to be applied before the cancer was
eradicated from the body social.
"Time cures nothing, but on the con
trary it intensifies existing evils and makes
bad men s hearts harder and more evil as
years roll on. And as it was with our own
people in the United States so is it with
other people.
"The classes must be kept in check and
jprevented from crushing the masses. And
lutewise the masses must be cueciced from
paralyzing the industries of the Jsation.
Labor must be protected, and the laboring
men nave a right to organize against the
crushing power of capital ; but labor must
not say to a man, 'You shan't work until
1 tell you. jfivery man must be privileged
to work for whom he pleases, but all have
a right to protest against foreign pauper
immigration." â¢ 6 v F
