LONDON, Eng., Dec. 28.â The Rome
correspondent of the Chronicle telegraphs
that the Spanish Government recently
questioned Great Britain, France and
Italy regarding their attitude in the event
of war between Spain and tbe United
States.
The correspondent adds that Great
Britain refused to give a definite reply,
saying that everything depended on the
course of events and the subsequent rela
tions of the contending nations.
Italy offered to assist in bringing about
an amicable arrangement of the trouble,
without promising to support Spain. The
attitude of the^'atican is absolutely favor
able to Spain.

NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 28.â A Her
ald special from Washington says: It is
reported that an important dispatch has
been received at tbe Spanish legation from
Premier Canovas, in which certain proposi
tions are made looking to the mediation
of the Cuban difficulties. lam unable to
obtain a confirmation of the report, but 1
give it as it comes to me from a usually
reliable source.
According to the report Senor Canovas
accepts the good offices ot the United
States, and states the terms which Spain
will accord to the insurgents, upon condi
tions to be proposed by the United States.
NO MERCY FOR SAJ-GUILLI.
An American Citizen Sentenced to â  Life
Imprisonment.
HAVANA. Cuba, Dec: 28.â The tribunal
before which* Julio Sanguilly, the
naturalized American citizen, charged
witn conspiracy against the Spanish
Government, was tried and found guilty
last week, the proceedings ending on
Saturday, held a public sitting at 1 p. m.
to-day when the sentence imposed by the
court upon the prisoner was read. The
sentence of the court is that Sanguilly be
imprisoned for life, and not for "eight
years and a day," as was previously cabled
to the United States.
Counsel for the defense announced that
he would appeal from the judgment of the
tribunal to the Supreme Court at Madrid
upon the ground that the indictment
against Sanguilly was defective in form,
and that the court proceedings were
irregular, and therefore an infringement
of the law.

DETAINED AT KEY WEST.
Owing to n strike of the Crew the
. t'arnoo** I* Tied Up.
JACKSONVILLE. Fla.. Dec. 28.â The
steamer Three Friends left Key West this
morning at 5:30 for Jacksonville with a
special deputy collector in charge, ' Assist
ant Secretary of the Treasury Wike left
Tampa yesterday to gather Information
concerning the alleged piracy on the part
of the crew of the Three Friends. In
Jacksonville to-day the case of libel lor
forfeiture against the vessel, in which she
is charged with being fitted out and armed
for war against Spain, was argued in the
United States Court. The Three Friends
will probably reach Jacksonville to-mor
row.
Ibe steamer Vamoose is still in Key
West, tbe crew being on a strike.
LIBEL OF THE THREE FRIENDS.
Daring and Novel Vefenae Made by the
Filibunt'r' Â» Vwnera.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Dec. 28.â The
case of the United States against the
steamer Three Friends, a libel for forfeit
ure of the vessel to the Gov-rnment for
alleged violation of section 6283. Revised
Statutes of the United States, was argued
in the United States court to-day. The
libel is basti upon tbe trip of the vessel
from this port last May, when she was
escorted to the three-league limits by the
revenue cutter Boutwell.
The section the Three Friends is charged
with violating prohibits the fitting out in
the United States of a vessel to go in the
service of a foreign prince or state, or of
any colony, district or people, to cruise or
make war upon another foreign power,
state, colony or people.
Tbe owners of the Three Friends con
tend in their answer to tbe libel that sec
tion 5283 does not apply to tbe Cuban re
bellion, because tbe United States has not
"RECOGNIZE CUBA BY ALL MEANS."
CHICAGO, 111., Dec. 27.â Hon. John K. Kedmond, the Irish member of the
British Parliament, who is in Chicago to lecture to-morrow night, aatd, when
Hiked his opinion of the Cuban question: "The United States should by all
means recognize Cuba. This country is the sponsor for what exists on this side
of the ocean, and recognition Is the only road left for Uncle Sam. I do not
think European powers would interfere if the Cubans were recognized. Any
one who knows anything about thfe relations of nations knows that no other
country is looking to interfere in Spain's behalf. I do not think that Spain
would go so far as to declare war against the United States."
The San Francisco Call.
recognized either the independence or
belligerency of the Cuban*, and the
United States cannot take cognizance of
the war until either the President or Con
gress recognizes the existence of war, and
therefore it was impossible for the Three
Friends to be engaged in the service of
one political power against another politi
cal power with which the United States
was at peace, the insurgents not constitu
ting a poiitical power recognized Dy the
United States, and therefore they are not
a "foreign prince, state, colony, district of
people," as desicnated in the statutes.
The United States District Attorney re
lies upon the fact that there have been
heretofoie confiscations of vessels for the
violation of this section where no war had
been acknowledged to exist, Dut the de
fense contends that its point, now de
pended on, had never been raised in any
case of prosecution for violation of section
5283. The defense admits that the Uniied
States Supreme Court in the Weborg and
Horsa cases recently held that section
5286, part of the same act, can b.< violated
without the necessity of acknowledg
ment of belligerency, but maintains that
the Supreme Court in the sani<3 case held
that section 5283 applied only to the case
of two recognized political powers en
gaged in acknowledged warfare.
The case was submitted and taken un
der advisement by the court. If the de
fendants win this case they hold that it
will be oi very great impoitance to the
Cubans, as the Government will then
have to recognize the belligerency of the
Cubans, or at least stop prosecutions for
confiscation of vessels under this section.
ARE AFRAID OF SHERMAN.
Spanish Officials, ( Hvtcnrer, Are Satis-
V'.yZi fied With Cleveland. I
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 28.â The
Herald's correspondent at Madrid cables
as follows: Premier Canovas, as the
mouthpiece of the Ministry, says that no
proposition cor-;erning Cuba can be con-
J oidered until important victories are ob
tained. The military spirit must prevail
first.
The Liberals, on the other hand, believe
that the Cuban question can be settled
upon a commercial basis, and that tbe
first step in that direction would be a
treaty of reciprocity. This, he believes,
would renew friendly relations between
the two coun tries, and by bringing pros
perity to Cuba and millions of new busi
ness to the merchants oi the United States
would make peace with Cuba possible.
When asked whether the Competitor
prisoners were to receive a civii trial his
Excellency replied: "The prisoners will
be allowed the legal assistance oi advo
cates, as provided in the protocol. The
previous trial not having been under these
provisions, the Government has granted a
new hearing."
"Have you received any official report
of|Maceo's death?"
"We have the report and are satisfied he
was killed in battle. The story that Maceo
was poisoned has no truth in it."
"Do you ieel assured thai Mr. Cleveland
will maintain his attitude of friendliness
until the close of his term ol office?"
"Yes; we feal that Mr. Cleveland and
Mr. Olney are doing ail in their power to
help Spain and not hinder us. But, you
see, you are on the eve of a change of Gov
ernment."
"Mr. McKinley has practically said that
air. Cleveland has taken the right course."
I ventured to suggest.
"That may be true," replied Senor Can
ovas. "It is not the President-elect we
doubt, but matters would be complicated
with" Mr. Sherman as Secretary of State.
He has said some very hard things about
j Spain. You see, it is not a question of
, Mr. McKinley, but of Mr. Sherman."
"Are you satisfied that the present ad
ministration is doing all that can be done
to prevent the departure of filibustering
expeditions from the United States T '
"We are assured that the efforts to pre
veut these expeditions are all that we
could expect, and I am satisfied that Mr.
Cleveland and Mr. Olney are exerting
themselves in that direction."
In speaking further of the administra
! tion Senor Canovas said: "I have just
received the official translation of Mr.
Cleveland's message and am greatly
pleased with his attitude."
MADRID, Spain, Dec 28.â The Duke of
Tetuan, Minister of Foreign Affairs, who
has given much attention to the question
of the naturalization of Cubans by the
United States Government, yesterday
granted an interview on the subject of the
negotiations which, it is hoped, may be
carried out. Diplomatically avoiding any
criticism of American laws and customs,
the Duke said:
"It seems to mo that if Spain and the
United States could arrive at some under
standing concerning the naturalization
laws, like the agreement with England,
France and Germany, the result would be
of more advantage to both countries."
"What steps have been taken to bring
about such an understanding?" was
asked.
"Spain's Minister at Washington, Senor
Dupuy de Lome, has been given instruc
tions to carry the matter to a successful
.conclusion and an agreement if possible.
The result depends upon the good inten
tion of the United States."
STARVATION IN CUBA.

NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 28.â A Herald
special from Los Palacios, Cuba, says:
The poverty of the people is heartrending.
Lieutenant Miiano. the alcalde, does all

ARIZONA IS LOYAL.
Governor Franklin Arnuaea Â» Storm by
Hit Peculiar Declaration.
PHCENIX, Ariz., Dec. 28â Mayor J. D.
Monition td-uay at the request of citizens
issued a call for a mass-meeting on
Wednesday night for the purpose of af
fording the people of Maricopa County
an opportunity to express their senti
ments in respect to tbe Cuban question.
This meeting is called because of ihe false
position in which Arizona is placed by the
publication in the New York Journal in
terview with Governor Franklin, in which
he said: "In the event of war with a for
eign country Arizona would not furnisti a
single volunteer for the army or navy."
People here feel deeply tbe disgrace this
has brought. This evening the Governor
saiJ it all arose from a misunderstanding,
as he thought the question propounded
referred to the present state of affairs. "Of
course," said he, "if war is declared Ari
zonans will not be found lacking in loyalty
and patriotism. Arizona would furnish
her full share of volunteers. All this no
toriety is simply the result of not under
standing the question."

BITTER GRIEF OF
A BOLD MURDERER
Criminal Career of Albsrt
Hense Downen Nears
the End.
Sentenced by a Colorado Judge
to Pay the Death Penalty
Next Month.
Realizing That the Gallows Draw
Nigh, the Once Boastful
Assassin Weeps
DENVER, Colo, Dec. 28.â Unless the
Supreme Court of the State of Colorado
interferes, Albert Hense Downen, the self
confessed and recently convicted mur
derer of Joel W. Ashworth, the wholesale
meat salesman, shot down on the night of
June 27 last, will we executed at the State
penitentiary some time during the third
week of next January. The motion for a
new trial argued before Judge Butler ten
days ago was denied in the West Side
Court this morning for the reasons ap
pended, and the famous prisoner sen
tenced.
Judge Butler had scarce announced his
decision ere Albert E. Foote. counsel for
Downen, arose and announced his excep
tion to the court's decision, and expressed
his intention of taking an appeal to the
Supreme Court. Assistant District Attor
ney Hayes thereupon moved for the im
mediate sentence of the prisoner.
Downen, who appeared in court un
shaven and weary from a night of unrest,
listened intently as Judge Butler calmly
discussed the case prior to announcing his
decision. A noticeable change came over
the face of the convicted criminal when it
became apparent that there was not the
remotest possibility of bis obtaining a
| new trial. His face paled, nis jaw dropped
and an expression of unutterable dejection
possessed him. He arose like one in a
dream and slowly tottered from the pris
oners' box, with the apparent decrepitude
of a man of 80 when the court pronounced
his name and asked him to step forward.
With bowed head and downcast eyes
Downen humbly faced the court as he
was asked if he had anything to say why
sentence of death should not be pro
nounced.
After a few seconds hesitation he replied
in indistinct tones, while his frame shook
with suppressed excitement, "I have
nothing to say except that 1 am innocent
of this murder." Then, unable longer to
restrain his emotion, the boasted mur
derer of Joel W. Ashworth and the reck
less perpetrator of a dozen audacious
crimes, cried like a child. The handker
chief which the trembling bands pressed
to the dimmed eyes was moistened with
the tears which flowed unrestrainedly.
Deliberately the court proceeded with
tbe distressing task before him.
"The sentence of this court," announced
Judge Butler in tones which descended
upon all with startling distinctness, "is
that you be remanded to tbe Sheriff, who
is hereby ordered to convey you to the
penitentiary at Canon City within a period
of twenty-four hours, there to be given
in the custody of the warden and kept in
solitary confinement until the beginning
of the third week of \ next January, ' when ;
youa 'holi . be .take to Â the place of execu
tion ami ha need by the necir until you are
dead, and may ;â  God % have â " raarcy on your ,
soul," solemnly concluded the court as
the tears glistened in bis eyes. 1- *i;ts tit
>1 Still weeping, Downen, who Â» received
the death sentence without any ejacula
tion J of terror, hastily left the courtroom
in the custody of a deputy Sheriff. ; He
gradually â became' composed and after
lighting a dear was returned to his cell in
the County Jail. '><"-â =â  > ;/" vi "' â¢'
In addition to the crime for which he
was to-day sentenced to death Downen
has confessed having committed two mur
ders and a great many hold-ups. Dow
nen's criminal record, according to his
confessions, is not by any means limited
to thiÃ vicinity. He acknowledges hav
ing committed robberies in several West
ern States, and has served time in San
Q uen tin, Cal., and Walla Walla, Wash.
CHICAGO BANK TROUBLES.
Following the Close of the At/as National,
the Dime Savings Is Expected to
Shut Down.
CHICAGO, 111., Dec. 28.â The Atlas
National Bank was practically in charge
of the Chicago Clearing- bouse Association,
representing the financial institutions of
this city, when the doors were opened to
the public at 10 o'clock this morning. De
positors were informed that as soon as
their accounts were balanced checks on
Trustee Lombard, president of the Na
tional Bank of America and chairman of
the Clearing-house committee, for the full
amount of their claims will be sent.
The well-known connection between the
Atlas Bank and the Dime Savings Bank, a
small but old institution, caused a report
that it would also be forced to liquidation.
Its doors were open for business as usual
to-day, but there was little business. The
other banss of the city are doing business
under normal conditions.
The resources of the Atlas National
Bank are estimated at $2,750,000, with ob
ligations approximating the same amount.
Owing to inability to realize the actual
value of the assets on a declining market
it will be necessary for the banks which
are mambeis of the Clearing-house Asso
ciation to advance between $500,000 and
$600,000 prorated according to their capi
tal stock, in order to pay all approved
claims in lull at once. This is expected to
be done within a week. The amount of
money needed to complete the liquida
tion is about $100,000 more than was at
first expected by the Clearing-house com
mittee. After Chairman Lombard of the
Clearing-house commutes, who is acting
as trustee for the associated banks, had
held a conference to-day with Cashier S.
W. Stone, the acting manager of the bank,
and had gone over some of the accounts,
he expressed his confidence that the bank
had not only ample assets to cover its lia
bilities, bat that the stockholders would
not fare badly in tne division of the assets.
President Grannis is iepo- f ed to be seri
ously ill at his home, and vis physicians
will not allow him to do anything in con
nection with the liquidation of the bank.
j It is known to the inner financial circle
that the Atlas Bank had not bien doing
a profitable business for a year, and with
in six weeks the stock was offered freely
from 85 down to 60. Lately it has been a
struggle for the bank to keep open, and
the assistance to honorably discharge its
obligations in full was gladly accepted.
The directors of the Dime Savings Bank
did not take any decisive action at a meet
ing held to-day. The bank will be kept
open for the transaction of the usual busi
ness. An insignificant few made deposits
to-day, while several hundred depositors
called to get their mo ney and were pre
j sented with a ninety days' notice of with
j drawal to fill out inste ad. The inevitable
result of this one-sided savings bank
business, in the opinion of bankers, is
that the Dime Bank will soon way up its
$380,000 of savings deposits and quit. This
step is expected as soon as the Atlas
affairs are wound up. Director R. C.
Clowry of the Dime Savings Bank and
Atlas National said there was Â«no cause
for any concern about the Dime Bank's
depositors getting all that is due them be
fore the ninety days allowed by law ex
pired, as the bank was thoroughly sol
vent. This bank has a special constitu
tion and by-laws which make each direc
tor and stockholder personally liable for
tbe full amount of its liabilities.
FAILURE FOLLOWS FAILURE.
Bankers J. S. and W. M. Van Xortwlek
Are Forced to the Wall.
GENEVA, 111., Dec. 28.â John S. and.
W. M. Van Nortwiok, bankers at Batavia,
111., made an assignment in the Kane
County court here this evening. All their
property, both in the Batavia bank and
stock in the large corporations in which
they are interested, were turned over to
the Equitable Trust Company of Chicago.
There were three assessments in all.
John S. and William M. assigned all their
personal property and homes and then
assigned as a firm. Tbe failure it is
thought was due to the liquidation of the
Atlas National Bank of Chicago, in which
the Van Nortwick's were heavy stock
holders.
The Van Nortwicks were interested in
the Western Paper Company at Aurora,
tbe Appleton Manufacturing Company at
Aurora, paper mi 'Is at Wauwaukanee,
Menashee, Wis.., aud Neenah, Wis. ; the
stock manufacturing company at Apple
ton, Wis.; cotton mills at Aurora, 111.,
and tbe Memphis Woodenware Company
at Memphis, Term.
The Batavia Bank remained open all
day for business, and when it closed to
night tbe people did not know that the
bank had gone to the wall.
SAVINGS OF A LIFETIME STOLEN.
But John Hurth, a Montana Miner, Plays
in Luck, for the Police Recover
the Treasure.
CHICAGO, 111., Dec. 28 âRobbed of
the savings of a lifetime, John Hurth, a
Montana miner, rushed into the Harrison
street police station yesterday morning
and reported his loss. For three hours a
leather pouch, containing $7500 in German
money, a collection of rare coins, deeds to
mining property in Butte, Mont., and a
gold nugget valued at $200, was in the
bands of women thieves. The pouch was
stolen from its owner in a resort at 400
Clark street and afterward recovered by
the police with the contents intact. When
the pouch was returned to Hurth he was
so overcome with joy that he wept.
Notwithstanding tne fact that Hurth
has traveled across the American conti
nent several times and also over a large
portion of Europe and Africa, be was cot
acquainted with the methods of the Chi
c&go levee thieves and he fell an easy vic
tim to them. During all his travels Hurth
has kept his wealth in a small leather
pouch, which, as a safeguard again- 1
thieves and robbers, he wore under his
clothing securely strapped to his waist.
When Hurth first discovered t tbat his
treasure had been stolen from him he be
came almost insane from grief. He was
so excited that it was some time before
the police were able to comprehend what
misfortune had befallen the man when be
first made his complaint. Finally, after
three hours of suspense, the pouch was
found under a bed in the house at 400
Clark street by the police of the Harrison
street station and returned to the owner.
Several hours after the robbery Detec
tives Reed and Jones apprehended two
colored women in a vacant lot in Ply
mouth place. At the police station they
were recognized as inmates of the resort
where the small fortune was stolen.

DEMAND OF POWERS ON THE PORTE.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Turkey, Dec. 28.â M. Nelidoff, the Russian Embassador
to Turkey, acting as spokesman for the concert of European nations, has notified
the Sultan that the agreement of the powers upon the question of the enforce
ment of reforms in Turkey is perfect, and that they demand there shall be no
delay on his part in giving assent to the proposal. The financial scheme formu
lated by M. Neiidoff is understood to involve the revision of the entire Ottoman
debt under the guarantee of tbe European powers signing the agreement. The
plan also contemplates the full control of European powers over Turkish revenue,
with tbe allotment of a fixed sum for the maintenance of the army and navy and
for the purpose of the Sultan's private purse. It further provides that the Sultan's
appointment of his Ministers shall be subject to approval or veto of the repre
sentatives of the powers in Constantinople.

LANDSLIDE
IN IRELAND
Boy Hill, County Kerry,
Descends Into the
Valley.
CARRIES ALL BEFORE IT
WITH A ROAR.
Residence of Lord Kenmare's
Steward Demolished and
Nine Lives Lost
LEAVES A TBAIL OF RUIN A
MILE IN WIDTH.
Finally tbe Huge Mass of Earth
Lands in the River Flesk and
Dams the Stream
DUBLIN, Ireland, Dec. 28.â A land
slide has occurred near Rathmore, County
Kerry, doing great damage to property
and causing the loss of at least nine lives.
Heavy rains have fallen in that part of
Ireland lately, with the result that the
same places that are generally dry now
resemble vast morasses. Near Rathmore
there is an eminence about a thousand
feet high, known as Boy Hill, and it was
here that tbe landslide occurred.
The rains percolating through the
ground gradually loosened a huee mass of
earth, and on Sunday night, apparently
without the slightest warning, a large
part of the surface of the hiil began to
slide toward tbe valley. Gaining momen
tum as it moved, it swept downward with
a roaring sound, carrying rocks, trees and
everything before it for miles. In some
places the path of the landslide was a mile
wide, ana as it moved along it buried
everything, entirely changing the aspect
of the section over which it passed.
Tbe residence of Mr. Donnelly, steward
of Lord Kenmare, one of whose seats, Kil
larney House, is at Killarney, was engulfed
in the mass of earth and debris and all of
its occupants, Mrs. Donnelly, his wife,
and seven children, were killed. It is sup.
posed that the house was swept from its"
foundations by the crushing mass, over
turned and buried it to a great depth. As
tbe present locality is not known it is
hardly probable that the bodies will be re
covered.
All the cattle, pigs and horses on tie
place were also buried, and there is now a
scene of utter desolation where on Sunday
stood tbe neat dwelling and outbuildings
of Mr. Donnelly.
Tbe movement of the landslide was to
tbe southwest, in the direction of the river
Flesk, into which a large section of the
earth slipped, blocking it up. The cur
rent of the river was employed in running
dynamos, which furnished electric light
for the Kerry lunatic asylum and some
buildings in Kil arney. The blocking of
the river, of course, stopped the current
and rendered the dynamos temporarily
useless. All the buildings using the
light from this source were plunged into
darkness and it was som? time before
other lights could be obtained.
The part of the hill where the slide be
gan was a bog and much of the earth that
moved off was soft. Huge quantities
plunged into the river, and there is dan
ger of the backwater flooding the country
around about unless the current is able to
carry the debris down with it. If any one
was passing along the roads at the time
the slide passed over tbe highways they
would surely have been buried. There
have Deen no reports of anybody being
missing and on this is based the befief
that there was no loss of life oqtside the
Donnelly family.
The thatch which formed the roof of the
Donnelly house was found floating in tbe
river, and dome people surmise that the
bodies of some of the family may have
been carried that far as weli.
The bog is stiil moving this afternoon,
but no further damage can result unless
it be the more effective damming of the
river.
IRELAND'S EXCLUSIVE TAXES

DUBLIN, Ireland, Dec. 28.â A meeting

Bat the Defeated Candidate With One
Ilea Is Rather Premature in
His Criticism.
LINCOLN, Nebr., Dec. 28.â The large
dining-room of the Lincoln Hotel was
tastefully decorated to-night when tbe 175
invited guests of the Lincoln Traveling
Men's Bryan Club sat down to tbe ban
quet wbich was given in honor of W. J.
Bryan. A large portrait of Mr. Bryan,
draped in tne National col rs, occupied a
prominent place at the head of the room.
The columns and arches of tbe dining
room wt-re covered with smilax, while the
north windows were banked with flowers
and plants. Letters of legret were read
from Hon. R. P. Bland, Missouri; Hon.
Charles A. Towne, Minnesota; C. S.
Thomas, Colorado; Hon. D. O. Meyer,
* Kansas; Governor Stone, Missouri; Gov
ernor Altgeid, Illinois, and Congressman
elect W. L. Stark, Nebraska.
In addition to the address delivered by
Mr. Bryan Governor Holcomb, Senator
W. V. Allen and other prominent men of
the State spoke.
Introducing Mr. Bryan Toastmaster
Hitchcock said: "The cause of tbe people
is never beaten â the hero of tbe people is
. never vanquished. After tbe gloom at Val
ley Forge came the glory at Yorktown.
After tbe disappointment of 1896 will
come tbe joyful triumph of 1900. To-night
we entertain a guest whom many millions
love and whom all tho world respects.
Gentlemen, I propose a toast to the great
guest of the evening â our candidate that
â was, our leader tnat is, and our Presi
dent that is to be! â William Jennings
Bryan of the United btates."
In responding to the toast Mr. Bryan
said:
I am glad to have the traveling men inter
ested in bimetallism, because they are always
able to defend any posit. on taken and are
traveling missionaries in behalf of" any cause
â which toe? espouse. I expect them to be of
great service during the next four years in
presenting the merits o{ free coinage to the
bu-inesj men of this country.
The traveling men are in a position to
measure the promises made by the Republican
party with tne fulfillment of those promises.
In other wotds they are prepared to compare
the goods delivered since :he election with
tbe samples snown during the campaign. The
public was told that Republican success would
restore confidence, and that confldenc â  was
the only thiug lacking. In Dun's Review of
November 7 we find these words: "A great
revolution bas been effected this week in the
conditions which control business. It could
sot be in any fair degree reflected as yet in
transactions or in records, but there is ample
evidence already that a crushing weight has
been lifted and rolled away, and the business
world has begun to adjusi itself to a state of
freedom and security wnich it has not known
for years. Dread of immeasurable disaster no
â longer locks up resources and paralyzes in
dustry, and new contracts involving many
millions have become binding since the elec
tion."
Tne lollowing week the same Review says:
"No one now doubts that the brighter day is
dawning, and it is the common remark that
never before hat business shown so great a
change for the better within a single week.
On the following week the Review starts out
with the statement: "The gain in volume of
bu-iness continues entirely without prece
dent." By the fourth week disappointment
began to manifest itself and I find, according
to D^n's report, that five of the eight reports
since the election show an increase of weekly
failures over the corresponding weeks of last
year. For the eight weeks since the election
the reports show seventy -live business failures
more ihan lor the corresponding eight weeks
of 1895. I cail attention to these figures be
cause they show either that confidence has
â  not vet been restored, or that if confidence has
been restored it has not restored prosperity.
Every faUure among the wholesale houses
moans a loss of employment to traveling men,
und every failure among retail establishments
means tbe'loss of a customer.
Bimetalltsts liove contended that hard
times are due mainly to ttie rise in the pur
chasing Dower of money. They have contend
ed that prosperity must begin with tne
farmer and laborer, and afterward reach the
commercial classes. The Republicans have
promised to restore normal conditions with
out increasing the volume of currency. What
they may do hereafter remains to be seen, but
it is evident thai they have thus far (ailed to
bring relief to the peot.le. Dua's Review of
December 26 reports a failing off of 24 per
cent in taut exchanges in the lending cities
/or the five days ending December 24 from
the corresponding days nf last year, and a
falling off of 16 per cent from the correspond
ing days of 1892.
WOLCOTT VIN IN McKINLEY
And the Senator "l Uinki He Will Control
f.mlnrndo Fatronia-e.
CANTON. Ohio, Dec. 28.â Senator E. O.
Wolcott spent two hours with Major Mc-
Kinley to-day, and departed in a very
happy frame of mind.
"1 came to Canton," said he, "as chair
man of the committee of five appointed
by the Republican Senators in caucus to
draft a bill t" carry into effect that plank
of tbe St. Louis platform on tbe subject of
international bimetallism. The bill meets
the hearty approval of the President-elect.
It authorizes the President to appoint dele
gates to an international monetary confer
ence when such a meeting shall be called
either by himself or by proper authorities
on behalf of another convention. It also
makes provision for meeting tbe expenses
of tbe delegates of the commission. I
think there will be an international con
ference. Several European countries are
interested in the matter, and sentiment in
favor of further recognition of silver
through international agreement is
spreading abroad. There will be a confer
ence within a short time after Major Mc-
Kinley is inaugurated."
Senator Wolcott talked on a number of
other topics, and remarked that any pro
nounced anti-silverman with a seed of
opposition to bimetallism would probably
rot be looked upon in the West with
favor as Secretary of the Treasury. It is
understood that the Federal appointments
in Colorado will be in the main made upon
the recommendatiou of Senator Wolcott.
Politicians from Minnesota who were
here to-day declare tbat there is active
opposition to the appointment of ex-
Governor Merriam to the Cabinet and tbat
if be were appointed Senator Davis would
oppose his confirmation.
Frank S. Witberbee, an active factor in
Naw York politics, spent an hour with
Major McKinley this afternoon. He said
the Republicans of New York had united
in asking for the appointment of Mr. Bliss
to the Cabinet, and declared Mr. Platt
would be tbe next Senator from that
State.
Mrs. Maria S. Saxton, an aunt of Mrs.
McKinley's by marriage, bas been in
vited by Major and Mrs. McKinley to
make her home in the White House with
them. Mrs. Saxton has accepted tbe in
vitation. She is one of Mrs. McKinley's
warmest personal frienas and will be with
her during all her residence in Wash
ington. ______^______
SAYS SHARKEY IS A DUB.
Fi'.zsimmons Also Declares That Corbett
Was Mixed Up in the "Foul"
Deal He Recived Here.
OMAHA, Nebr.. Dec. 28.â 80b Fitz
slmmons arrived in the city this after
noon from Denver to give an exhibition
of his skill as a professional boxer. To a
representative of the United Ass >ciated
Presses he said, in speaking of his recent
fight with Sharkey at San Francisco:
"Yes, that was a pretty bad deal I got
out on tbe coast, and I am of the opinion
that it has put a quietus for all time on
that town as a sporting place. From cer
tain facts in my possession I am con
vinced that Jim Corbett was mixed up in
the deal."
"And so am I," interiected Julian.
"Sharkey," continued Fitzsimmons, "is
nothing but a big, strong dvb â that sums
him up. I told Julian in the fourth
round that be wanted to quit, for I could
see by bis actions tbat he was looking for
a soft place to fall upon, but he did not
dare to until the referee had given the
word, which in this case was 'Foul,' and
he gave it and Sharkey dropped. Every
-1 body interested knows the rest."
Speaking of his anticipated fight with
Corbett, Fitzsimmons said:
"We will be in New York New Year's
day, and we will then slsn the articles. I
will not believe that Corbett means busi
ness until I see him in front of me in the
ring. It's a funn^ thing, if you have
noticed it. As soon as the articles are
brought out, Corb-tt begins training. It
seems to me that about all he does is to
train. Why doesn't he fight?"
Fitzsimmons is in excellent spirits, and
says so far as be is concerned tbe articles
for himself and Corbett are perfectly sat
isfactory, and Julian also says that he can
find no fault with them. The Fitzsim
mons party consists of the eminent pugi
list, his wife, Robert Jr., Martin Julian
and Trainer Hickey.
Declared the Fight a Draw.
BUFFALO, N. V., Dec. 28.â Four hun
dred people saw Matt Matthews of New
York and John Laughlin of this city fight
fourteen rattling rounds to a draw at the
Conners Athletic Club to-night. Mat
thews was the a -gressor throuzhout. He
weighed in at 133 pounds and Laughlin at
138.
In the thirteenth round Matthews
nearly floored bis man with a rigbt fling
on the ear while in Lacghlin'x corner.
While trying to finish bis man, Matthews
claimed that one of Laughlin's seconds
struck him, but the referee ordered the
right to go on. Matthews landed at least
five times to bis opponent's once, but in
the fifteenth round the referee declared
the contest a draw.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 29, 1896.
VICTORY FOR THE
SANTA FE SYSTEM
Judge Myers Dismisses the
Action for a Receiver
in Kansas.
Decides That a Railroad Right
of Way Is Not Real Estate
in a Legal Sense.
Bat Attorneys Will Appeal tbe Cele
brated Case to tbe Supreme
Court of tbe State.
OSKALOOSA, Kans., Dec. 28.â The cele
brated suit for a receiver of tbe Santa Fe
property in Kansas was decided here this
afternoon by Judge Lewis A. Myers in
favor of the Santa Fe.
Court convened at 3 o'clock, and Judge
Myers at once handed down his decision.
The gist of the decision is that the act
known as the alien land law under which
this suit was brought ooes not apply to
railroads, and that tbe rigbt of way of a
railroad company is not real estate, in the
eyes of tbe law. The other questions of
law raised by the attorneys on both sides
were not passed upon by Juage Myers, as
he held this point alone was sufficient to
end the litigation.
The decision is a complete victory for
the Santa Fe. The attorneys for the plain
tiff will at once tÂ»ke steps to carry the
case to the Supreme Court on an appeal.
They will also make an effort to get the
case reopened in this court on a new point
suggested by Judge Myers' decision tbat
the right of way of the ban ta Fe is held
not be real estate. Every effort will be
made to get a speedy hearing in the Su
preme Court, and it is thought it will
come up at the February term.
The decision to-day is upon the hearing
recently had before Judge Myers at Leav
enworth. The opinion holds that the
provisions of chapter 3, session laws of
1891, relating to aliens, under which the
action was brought, are not applicable to
rai. roads. The Judge said:
"It is only necessary to express an opin
ion upon the question argued before this
court. That is the pivotal point in the
case. It is: Does chapter 3 of the session
laws of 1891 apply to property necessarily
used in the opera in? of a railroad?" Tbe
statute is then cittd und the opinion con
tinue- : "The great weight of judicial
authority in this country is that the prop
erty of a railroad company necessary for
tbe operation of its railroad cannot be
seized and fjoid in parcels under an execu
tion.
"The courts have so held invariably
when considering the words 'real estate'
THE PACIFIC SHORT LINE.
GIOUX CITY, lowa, Dec 28.â Donald McLean, the original organizer of the Pa
cific Short Line, arrived here to-day to arrange for a survey of the road from O'Neill,
Nebr., to San Francisco. The road was started six years ago, but only got from
Sioux City to O'Neill before the crash of local business enterprises in 1893 forced
its abandonment. As planned it will be 246 miles shorter than any other trans
continental line. Mr. McLean claims to be backed by $32,000,000 of English capi
tal and says the work will be rushed through.
and 'lands' that the same should not be
taken to mean roadbed or right of way of
a railroad company, or other property
necessary for it to use in the performance
of its chartered obligations. Tbe real
estate held or acquired by a public cor
poration, like thai held or owned by a
railroad company in the exercise of emi
nent domain and necessary for uses in
which, the public is concerned, is not
within the meaning of the law real
estate.''
Then follow citations in several cases,
and the opinion concludes as follows:
"Considering all of the provisions of the
statute of 1891, in view of the well-known
mischief intended to be remedied thereby,
and especially in view of the express
terms of the statute providing how r vi
estate forfeited must be divided into par
cels and sold, I am forced to conclude that
the term 'real estate' employed in section
2 and other sections of the statute was not
intended to embrace a railroad or essen
tial part thereof. The Legislature did not
intend to make tbe provisions of the
statute applicable to railroads. The re
sult follows that tbe plaintiff's petition in
this case does not state a cause of action.
The statute fails to provide for a forfeiture
of railroads on account of alien ownership
of capital stock in every corporation, and
no petition can be formulated under the
provision of this statute which should be
sufficient to forfeit and sell tbe property
of the defendant corporation, used in the
operation of its railroad. la my opinion,
neither tbe letter nor tfce spirit of tbe
statute includes railroads. The orders ap
pointing a receiver and granting injunc
tions in aid thereof, will be vacated and
set aside." _______________
CONTRACT LABOR ABOLISHED.
Strange as It May Seem the New Law
Does Not Please the Empire
State Prisoners.
ALBANY, N. V., Dec 28â The prison
ers in the various penal institutions of the
Empire State are finishing up the work on
hand with all possible dispatch, in view of
tbe fact that tbe law abolishing contract
labor goes into effect at midnight Thurs
day. In Sing Sing, Auburn and Danue
mora large numbers oi convicts are already
ide, the tasks upon which they have been
occupied having been finished and the au
thorities being unwilling to start them on
new jobs in the limited time remaining.
Over 10,000 prisoners are affected by the
new law, and the Slate is deprived of a
source of revenue which of late years has
exceeded a quarter of a million dollars an
nually.
Eventually a small proportion of tbe
prisoners can be employed in manufactur
ing supplies for institutions controlled by
the State, but to do this considerable ex
pensive machinery will be required, and
the convicts must" needs be trained in tbe
new wort. The outlook has given great
concern ff> the wardens and others in au
thority, from the fact that it is recognized
tbat confinement without employment is
a menace to the mental and physical
health of the convicts, and renders the
maintenance of discipline twice as diffi
cult.
Statistics have shown tbat inactivity
and solitude are potent factors in driving
convicts to insanity, and fears are enter
tained that the new law, while it may
benefit free labor, as it is intended to do,
will bring about an unenviable condition
of affairs inside the prisons, and more
especially in the cases of the long-term or
life convicts, who will be compelled to sit
k dajrÂ»fM*4--Â«--Miut Mll s brooding over 1
the past and with no outlook for the fa
tnra".
There have of late been numerous inter*
changes oi opinions between the chiefs of
the different institutions, and suggestions
beve been broached for instituting mili
tary drills and various other exercises in
the open as a partial means of relieving
the insanity-breeding monotony to which
the convicts will be subjected under the
new law. The convicts tnemselves dread
the new order of things as much as their
keepers, and the wardens of the principal
institutions have been deluged with oral
and writtt- n communications from convicts
appealing for employment in the kitchen
or anywhere else within the institution,
so that they might be kept physically
active.
The new law is the outcome of the con
stitutional convention of 1894, which com
pelled the passage by the Legislature of a
law forbidding, after Thursday of this
week, the farming out or contracting of
the labor oi prisoners.
WORST OF ALL LIVING FIENDS.
Kimball Township, Mich., Has a Brutal
Son Who Would Ornament the
Gallows.
DETROIT, Mich., Dec. 28.â A special to
tbe Journal from Port Huron says: Of all
tbe fiends that ever lived or have been
hanged Archie McCollom of Kimball
Township, near here, is the worst. Mc-
Collom, who is 40 years old, lives with
bis aged mother, who is 84 years old, on
the Hilliker Farm, in that township.
Saturday night he came home intoxicated
and started abusing bis mother. He
knocked her down, kicked her, bit a
big chunk of flesh out of her face and
threw it into the stove, and after pound
ing her into insensibility finished bis
dastardly work by committing a criminal
assault on her person. The arrival of a
farmhand prevented McCollom from
further abusing his mother. McCollom
has been arrested and will be locked up
in the County Jail here. Talk of lynch
ing is beard. Doctors have doubt? of
Mrs. McCollom's recovery, as she is ter
ribly injured.

SUICIDE WHILD DESPONDENT
Verdict of the Coroner' Â» Jury in the Case
of Hanker H aama-mdorff.
CHICAGO, 111., Dec. 28.â The Coroner's
inquest over the body of the banker, Otto
F. D. Wasmansdorff, who committed sui

tae family residence on Cleveland avenue.
The sad scene was brightened early by tbe
childish prattle of the suicide's only grand

to whom he addressed his last words. She
was searching for her grandfather, while
every other member of the family was

is still in a serious condition. Aiter hear
ing the testimony of the dead banter's
two sons as to the mental condition of
their father, and hearing the circum
stances of the tragedy, the jury returned
a verdict of suicuie while despondent.

This would mean tbat in the ordinary
way the elephants would soon become
Killed off, were not the largest part of the
importation taken from the stores which
have been laid up by nature, as if in an
ticipation of the requirements of modern
people.
These stores are practically the ceme
teries of the elephant world for centuries
and centuries, and the ivory is fetched
from them by the natives, and sold to the
traders, to be by them exported with com
paratively little trouble and without in
curring any risk to their lives.

INTO HISTORY
Venezuela Incident Closed
So Far as Uncle Sam
Is Concerned.
Further Negotiations Lie Wholly
Between Great Britain and
Venezuela.
Sen or Andrade Ready to Sign the
Treaty, bat Sir Ja ian Must First
Hear From London.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec 28.â Tbe
international incident of tbe Venezuelan
boundary dispute is considered closed, as
far as tbe United States is concerned, and
all further negotiations for its adjudica
tion lie wholly with the two parties to tbe
controversy, Venezuela and Great Britain.
This explanation comes from the State
Department, where it is further stated
that, with the acceptance of the Venezue
lan executive three weeks ago of the heads
for the proposed treaty of arbitration as
signed by Sir Julian Pauncefote and Mr.
Olney on November 12, tbe friendly inter
vention of the United States had been
completed and the only additional acts of
the United States in the matter will be
the publication of evidence and reports
collected by the Venezuelan High Com
mission and the eventual reference to the
United States Supreme Court of the con
current request of the two countries for
the appoiutment of two jurists as mem
bers of the tribunal as provided by the
treaty.
As the Venezuelan Congress, which
must pass upon this treaty, has been
called to meet in extra session on Feb
ruary 1, instead of waiting until its con
stitutional meeting day, February 20, it is
presumed that Mr. Andrade and the
British Embassador will complete the de
tails of the convention directly in order
that it may reach Caracas within a month.
Such negotiation is thought to be devoid
of any great importance as the beads of
the treaty have already been disposed of
and only certain well-defined formulas of
introduction are wanting.
At noon to-day Secretary Olney drove
to the British embassy and bad a long
conference with Sir Julian Pauncefote,
presumably with reference to the treaty.
Senor Andrade, the Venezuelan Min
ister, who arrived from Venezuela last
night, also met Sir Julian at tbe'Britisn
embassy this afternoon and discussed the
few remaining details relating to tbe
treaty. The Venezuelan Government is
very dosirous tbat a citizen of that coun
try should be placed on tbe board of arbi
tration, and it is well known tbat Senor
Andrade cherishes the hope tbat this may
be done, though his wishes are not likely
to be gratified. It was tbe belief in Car
acas that this consideration would not be
shown to Venezuela and this formed the
basis of some of the opposition to its ap
proval. .
The treaty itself simply .provides tbat
two jurists of the United States Supreme
Court and two members of the British Su
preme Court shall select the board and
t at in tbe event of their failure to agree
King Oscar of Sweden shall nominate the
fifth umpire. The time add place of
the meeting have been left blank in the
treaty, to be agreed upon by Sir Julian
and tenor Andrade. It may be stated
that these meetings will not be held
either in Venezuela, the United States or
in British territory. Neutral ground, sat
isfactory to both countries, will be select,
ed, and it is not improbable that for a
variety of reasons Paris or Brussels may
be chosen.
It may be ten or twelve days before tbe
protocol may be signed. The treaty pro
vides tbat Sir Julian and Senor Andrade
may sign for their respective Govern
ments, but Sir Julian cannot do this until
he receives formal instructions from Lon
don, and it is understood these have not
been mailed.
Senor Andrade, on tbe other band, is
said to have brought thii authority with
him to Washington, but he will defer ac
tion until Sir Julian can act conjointly
with him.
INGL O-AMERICAS TREATY.
It '- Will Soon BÂ» /signed and Beady for
' â¢ Action by Congrent. ' :
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec 28,-The
latest information respecting tbe Anglo-
American treaty, under tbe terms of which
future disputes between the United States
and Great Britain not involving the na
tional honor of the two Governments are
to be referred to an arbitration tribunal, is
that it will be signed by the British Em
bassador, Sir Julian Pauncefote, and by
Secretary Olney this week. The point of
difference between tbe two^gentlemen was
settled a few days ago and cabled to Lord
Salisbury for his approval.
State Department officials believe that
Lord Salisbury's reply, which is expected
to be favorable, will reach Washington not
later than Wednesday, in which event the
formal signing of the treaty will im
mediately follow. It is predicted to-day
tbat tbe treaty will be sent to the Senate
within a few days after the reassembling
of Congress next week.
BOXING UP A STEAMSHIP.
Portable Vessel* for Use in South Amer
ica a New Idea in Shipbuilding;.
The task of building a steamship, setting
it up and then shipping it to Soutn Amer
ica in boxes, such as was performed re
cently at Nixon's shipyard, in Elizabeth*
port, was novel in shipping experiences in
this country. Portable bouses have been
common for many years. Portable steam
ers have been not uncommon in this coun
try. They nave been set up on many
lakes, especially in tbe West, where there
has been no facility for building 3ucb craft.
Tbe two vessels tbat ply on Devils Lake,
In North Dakota/are instances of that, for
they were brought from the banks of the
Mississippi even in tbe days when the
hostile Sioux ranged through North Da
kota. Such vessels hare usually been
stowed away on monster trucks, They
have usually been of wood.
The one that Mr. Nixon tent to the
United Btates of Colombia, to ply on the
Magdalena River, had to be put in boxes,
big and little. Altogether there were
something like 200 of these boxen. They
filled three lighters, and were loaded from
the lighters to a tramp steamship. Tbe
name of tbe portable steamer was tbe
Maria Hanabergh. Of course it was a
small affair, but it was built with as much
care as a larger vessel. It was built on
ways, as if It were to be launched here.
Every plate and beam was pat in place,
all the -woodwork was fitted, the engine
and every part of the craft was made to fit
just as if the boat was to rly in these
waters. The rivets, however, were not put
in. The vessel was painted blue on one
side of the interior and white on the other
side of t c inter.or. This was to facilitate
the erection of the vessel on the Magda
lena River.
Every plate, bolt and frame was marked
to correspond with the plans, and then
the little craft was taken apart and this
and that part packed away in boxes. The
boilers, of course, needed no boxes, but
each piece of the machinery and each part
of the hull was stowed away without dif
ficulty.
Mr. Nixon will send one of his assist
ants to the destination of the vessel co su
perintend her erection. She will be put
together on ways and launched precisely
as she would have been launched had she
remained in this country. It is simply a
question of riveting the hull together, and
of fastening the parts of tbe engine to
gether, and then tbe vessel will be com
plete. It i 9 interesting to know that Mr.
Nixon had foreign competition in securing
the contract for the vessel. He underbid
three foreign shipyards as to price, and
also guaranteed to deliver the vessel
quicker than any other bidder. He built
the craft in almost exactly sixty days.â

TO BLOW UP VESSELS.
The Automatic Sentinel Invented by
Lieutenant Bradt.
An improvement in tbe method of pro
tecting a harbor with submarine torpe
does has recently been invented by Lieu
tenant Francis B. Bradt of the Siemens
Halske Company of America. Tnis he
terms an "electro-magnetic" sentinel.
The special object of Lieutenant Bradt's
invention is automatically to give warn
ing of tbe presence of a vessel in the
vicinity of a submarine mine and to pro
vide means for exploding it at such time.
The method of accomplishing this object
at tbe right moment in old systems is D'y
means of the electric range finder, but
this necessitates two stations and two ob
servers, and, moreover, is inoperative at
night or in foggy or stormy weather, when
vision is obstructed.
Lieutenant Bradt's invention, however,
is automatic in its action, trives warnings |
day or night and is absolutely sure in its ;
operation. Tbe device, as described in
t; c Electrical Review, consists of a huge
induction coil, located under water at the
place of the concealed mine, the core oi
wnich forms an open magnetic circuit
Tbe terminals of the wire coil forming the
induction coil are connected with a source
of rapidly alternating currents situated on
tbe shore. This induction coil is secured
to the mine or torpedo and is provided
with a fuse, which can be connected with
a source of powerful, diiect electric cur
rents through a switch operated by the
observer. The circuit of the fuse being
highly self-inductive, alternating currents
cannot pass of sufficient strengtn to oper
ate the iu-e, but which offers no great re
sistance to the passage of direct currents.
The action oi the device is as follows:
When an iron vessel passes over the ends
of tbe iron core of tne induction coil the
magnetic current is thereby made more
complete, increasing the self-induction of
the coil, and, consequently, decreasing
the strength of tbe alternating currents
passing through it, which currents are
supplied by the insulated wires connect
ing the apparatus with the source of cur
rent on the shore. In this circuit is placed
an instrument for indicating any varia
tion in tbe current strength, so that the
attendant knows by watching the index
of the instrument when to throw the
switch and explode tbe mine. Or, if de
sired, the instrument may be made auto
matic by providing a contact device, such
tbat when the current decreases to a cer
tain predetermined limit the exploding
circuit is completed and the explosion
occurs. â Philadelphia Record.

ON THE TARIFF
Merchants Before the Ways
and Means Committee
of the House.
Duties on Chemicals, Spirits
and Wines Receive First
Consideration.
Sao Franciscans Among Those Who
Ask More Protection for
Hcme Products.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 28.â The
first of twelve public hearings to be given
on the revision of tbe tariff was begun
this morning. Chairman Dingley pre
sided and there was a pretty full attend
ance. Though Dingley has requested that
the communications should be iv writing
as far as possible, it is anticipated that
tbe so-called "hearings" will be in large
part "readings." Nevertheless there were
a number of leading chemical manufac
turers present, the first day being devoted
to schedule A, chemicals, oils and paints,
and schedule H, spirits, wines and otner
beverages.
The first schedule only was under dis
cussion this morning. Among those pres
ent were representatives of Philadelphia
firms and other manufacturers from Chi
cago, Cincinnati and other large cities.
Their general views favored the restora
tion of specific duties. There were only
six members of the committee present,
the chairman (Dingley of Maine), Daizell
of Pennsylvania. Payne of New York,
Evans of Kentucky and Johnson ot North
Dakota, all Republicans, and McMUlin ol
Tennessee, Democrat. The two first gen
tlemen, who were beard on the chemicals.
paints and oils schedules, were Thomas
A. Harrison of Philadelphia and Henry
Krebbs Jr. of San Francisc.
Dr. Harrison, representing the Manu
facturing Chemists' Association, was the
first to address the committee. His asso
ciation desired rates to be specific instead
of ad valorem as at present. He said a
committee of five, aDcointed by nis asso
ciation, would submit later in writing the
rates desired on chemicals.
Henry M. Krebbs of San Francisco,
speaking of t tie chenr.cal schedule, said
that the tariff act of 1*94 did not meet the
expectation of the Government or tbe
manufacturers. He desired a change in
the classification of borate of lime and
borate of soda. Tne present law was de
fective ia its specifications and he desired
it changed so as to be more explicit. Un
der it the American miners and producers
had been deprived of one-half of the home
maiket, because under the name of crude
borate of lime a calcined concentrated and
artificially treated material containing a
very high percentage of boric acid was
imported.
James McGuire of New York desired a
change In the classification and wording
of the alumina schedule.
No change in the rate of duty was de
sired, but under the present law it was
neceisary to imoort 36 per cent of water to
get their product?
H. C. Stewart of Philadelphia asked for
a duty on ocher, ochery earths, senna and
oxide of iron. If these articles remained
on the free list two more years they could
not live.
E. L. Snyder of New York, representing
the National Wholesale Liquor-dealers"
Association, said the duties oc spirits
Ehoulc be so adjusted as to not bar out
foreign products. An increase should be
mane in the rate on foreign wines. Rates
should be fixed so as to yield revenue and
treat fairly both the. foreign and domestic
products. Ha advocated a penal law ior
counterfeiting foreign brands.
F. Jacobi of San Francisco did not agree
with Mr. Snyder in regard to wines. He
asked the restoration of the McKinley
rates on wine â 50 cents per gallonâ and
$2 50 per gallon on all other spirits. He
held that this duty would not increase the
price of the domestic wine. Domestic
manufacturers aimed to keep the price
low. They supplied the massesâ the
poorer classesâ and the advanced duty
would be detrimental to their interests.
He asked the committee not to extend
the reciprocity clause to foreign liquors.
Mr. Jacobi, in advocacy of an increased
duty oa wines, was supported by Edward
Frawenfeld of California and P. L. Crovat,
manager of the Leland Stanford estate.
The committee adjourned until 12 o'clock
to-morrow, when those interested in the
cotton schedule will De beard.

FAVORS A PACIFIC CABLE.
Representative Loud Explains Why He In-
traduced the Bill to Promote
Spaulding's Scheme.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec 28.â 1n ex
planatiou of his action in presenting
Colonel Spaulding's Pacific cable bill Rep
resentative Loud of California to-night
gave the following to the press:
"The reason that prompted me to intro
duce this bill was the fact that Mr. Spaul
ding holds the only concession to Â»land a
cable on the Hawaiian Islands, hence we
must conclude that no other company
could carry out its contract."
"Do you believe the proposition of the
Spaulding Company to build to Japan and
Australia a bona-tkie one?"
"I could not say as to that. Whether
that proposition was made in good faith
lam not able to say. In considering the
fact that Spaulding had the only conces
sion to Hawaii, we must assume that his
is the company prepared to buiid there."
"Do you believe that a cable to Hawaii
at the present time would be of such bene
fit to tbe Pacific Coast as would justify you
in advocating the Spa-aiding bill as against
a bill which intended Japan as tbe im
portant objective point and Hawaii a sec
ondary consideration.
"No, I could not advocate the Spauld
ing bill in antagonism to any other. I am
advocating it because of tbe fact that nc
other company has a concession, and
hence could not build to Hawaii. In view
of the fact that it is the prevailing senti
ment that when the Spaulding concession
expires some Engli-h company will secure
a renewal of it, I must urge the early
adoption of the Spaulding proposition,
which I believe to be the only bona-tide
one. I have heard from Hawaiian repre
sentatives that there would be a tendency
to turn this concession over to an Eng
lish company, and there has been talk
| about tendering the island to English mi
i fluence in some form. If we had a cable
there it would tend to bring us closer to
gether, and would be of special benefit to
the Pacific Coast, because we control, sub
stantially, the trade of the islands."

KANSAS CITY, ilo. Dec. 28. âThe
McCoy banking company of Independ
ence, Mo., went into voluntary liquida
tion to-day. The bank refused to receive
deposits this morning and began paying
its depositor"? in full. There wa3 no run
on the bank and the directors gave notice
in the Independence newspapers asking
depositors to como after their money.

ot business is that its president, William
McCoy, is too advanced in years to
j manage its affairs loneer. He is 85 years
i old. Tbe capital stock of the bank is
$50,000. On August 10, when the last re
por' was made, it owed to its depositors

SAN JOSE GREETS
A LEARNED HOST
Fifteen Hundred Teachers
Gather in Annual
Convention.
President Linscott Reviews
Year's Work and Hopes
for Progress.
Visitors Entertain d by tbe Normal
School Alumni Association at
Night.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Dec 28.â Teachers
have been arriving: all day to attend the
sessions of the thirtieth annual conven
tion of the California Teachers' Associa
tion, which convened in tbe Normal
School Hall this afternoon. Thi3 evening
there were not less than 1500 educator in
the city. The incoming trains were met
by the reception committee and the
teachers escorted to daces provided for
them. The leading hotels are tilled.
When the convention was called to or
der by President T. W. Linscott in Nor
mal Hall at 2 o'clock this afternoon, the
immense hall was filled to overflowing.
The place had been prettily deoorated
with flowers and vines. The other officers
of tbe association in attendance were:
vice-presidents, Frances A. Dean of San
Francisco and F. N. Miller ol San Dieeo;
secretary, Anna C. Murphy of Berkeley;
assistant secretary, W. F. Hall of Berke
ley ; railroad secretary, J. W. McCLymonds
of Oakland ; treasurer, Bessie G. Haslam
of Santa Cruz. After organization hai
been perfected, President Linscott read
his annual address, which was in part as
follows:
Another page of tbe world's history has been
recorded since we met at Oakland one year
ago. The thoughts, words and deeds of 1896
have become apart of the life of the race, anil
have left their indelible impress either for
good or evil. The successes and the failures
of each individual life have been wovan into
tlie fabric of human events. Let us trust that
the threads of the former are more numerous
than those of the latter.
Representing a very important phase of the
educational work of the State, we have as
sembled once more to discuss questions npper
taining to our vocation, to listen to words of
wisdom and experience and to consult with
each other as to plans lor renewed activity for
the coming year. Let us hope that a spirit o:
helpful ness and brotherhood may find place
in each heart, and that we may go forth from
this session stronger, better, nobler, because of
our sojourn together.
We nave with us this year one whom we de
light to honor, not only lor the high educa
tional position which he holds In our land,
but because of the place he has won as one of
the foremost educators of the age. His mas
terly grasp of educational endeavor from the
kindergarten to the university, his contribu
tions to our pedagogical literature and his
earnest sympathy with tbe common details of
school work have been potent factors In the
ad vai.ee movement oi education.
I think we may safely say that there has
been a forward movement educationally
throughout the State during the past year.
TUe bonds of union between the several de
partments of our common labor have been
more closely drawn than ever before aud au
earnest desire for more light is clearly notice
able.
Our great universities are fulfilling, in a
large measure, the prophecies and the prom
ise;, of the past. Thousands of young men and
women have possession of advantages which
their fathers and mothers knew not of. The
commonwealth should be, must be, stronger
because of the work done therein.
Our state University finds itself hampered
by lack of accommodation for the youth who
congregate at Berkeley. The recent report of
the Recorder shows a larger enrollment of
students than at any previous time in its
history. Surely some measures of relief must
be taken very soon. Poorly lighted and poorly
ventilated recitation-rooms, which wi uld not
be tolerated in an up-to-date school, are
crowded to overflowing with students.
Recent events indicate that in the near
future California philanthropy will augment
the provisions of the State to cuch a degree as
shall place tbe university upon as high a
plane in temporal things us that on which she
now stands in things intellectual. In the
meantime we trust that the State will relieve
tbe immediate pressing necessity, and to this
end every true lover of education and of Cali
foruia should work.
Our secondary schools, whose phenomenal
growth has been the wonder of the past few
years, have kept pace with the forward move
ment. They are better equipped wi th teachers
and the necessary appliances for work.
But I think one who has carefully noted the
educational movement of the State cannot
fail to have observed that the most hopeful
sign of better th.pgs comes from our ele
mentary schools. Never before has there been
such professional activity and such an ear
nest desire lor a broader, deeper conception of
whtt it is to be a teacher of children. It is
noticeable in the work of our teachers' insti
tutes, which in many cades have regular stand
ing committees which are studying and in
vestigating along different lines of school
work, thus binding the thought and the dis
cussions of one session to those of the next;
in the increase in the formation of profes
sional reading cice'res; in the caretul.'y pre
pared and thoughtful reports on the ques
tions proposed for discussion by the Council
of Education; in the increasing interest of
child-study, which, though it may not have
been scientifically pursued by the individutil
teacher, has caused many a modification of
methods in dealing with children, and in the
ingrowing thought among our teachers that a
course of study and the true method of using
it is not this growth of n day, but must be the
result of earnest, thoughtiul searching after
truth. May the .time sooa come when only
those who are willing to work, think and
grow shall be permitted to teach our children,
or De recognized as worthy oi the profession.
We owe much to the earnest, scholarly men
who during the past few years have traversed
the length and breadth of our State and have
met tbe teachers of our common schools in
their own localit.es; have inspired them with
new thougnts and nigher ideas of their voca
tions; above all, have sympathized with them
in the minute details of schoolroom life. The
helpful, inspiring words of Brown, Barnes,
Bailey, Griggs and others have cheered the
heart of many a country teacher. The influ
ence they have exerted upon the lives and
work of men and women in this common
we?lth cannot be estimated.
But after all that might be said of the favor
able conditions of our schools, after we have
prided ourselves, and justly too. on their ex
cellence es compared with other localities, is
there not much to be hoped for, much to be
worked for, ere we approximate the ideal in
education? There can be no question but that
in much of our present work the curriculum
rather than the child itself is made the impor
tant thinar.
Someone has said, "What a man has learned
is of importance, but what he is, what he can
do, what he will become, are more significant
things." Have we not la the past, are we not
to-day, givfng too much prominence to the
knowledge side of education and too little to
the character side.
I believe that our boys and girls average
well with those of other communities, yet one
cannot fall to observe a lack of sell-depend
ence, a lack, of reverence for the true and
noble, s lack of veneration for the wise and
good. The very life of our Nation depends
upon our ability to counteract those influ
ences which are constantly- Â«v work through
slanderous tongues, the printed page and
beastly cartoons, which tend in a large meas
ure to increase irreverence for authority and
for those institutions of government which are
the bulwarks of our liberties.
Bo educate our youth that in the coming
days politics shall not be considered a filthy
pool to be abhorred, but ratber an opportu
nity for service which should not be lightlr
esteemed and iv which all should be deeply
concerned.
If I mistake not the signs of tbe times we are
beginning to see that we must break away
from much of the formalism of the past, yea,
even of the present, and give more attention
to the development of human life and charac
ter. What the world needs in this day of won
derful activty 18 a manhood and a woman
hood loyal to duty, duty to self, duty to others.
Tne real purpose of the public schools is to
educate men for true citizenship In the high
est sense of tfce t rm; to develop characters
that shall "work for righteousness" in tbe
Nation; to instill into the youth the supreme
thought that life is worth livingâ that it is a
stage of action on which each must play his
part nobly if the true end of his being is to be
attained; to produce, as far as possible, men
and women who 6hall be strong pnysically,
intellectually and morally. If this is not tie
aim of our schoolwork, if the individual
teacher does not feel its importance over the
mere routine of preparation for examinations
and promotions, then it is surely time for a
radical change.
There can be no auestion that our
curricula and our methods of using the same
ere, in many respects, sadiy deficient in bring
ing about the best results. We have material
ly increased the number of subjects to be
taught without making adequate provision
for the place of the new material. We have
been giving at least one-third of tne time
allotted to school work to arithmetic during
the entire elementary course ot eight or nine
years, but the results have not been commen
surate with the expenditure of time and
energy. We have seen this for years, and yet
our course of study, as a rule, continues to
dictate that "All possible combinations of
numbers from 1 to 12," etc., shall be ground
over day after day of the child's first year of
school life; and thus the work is continued
from grade to grade in the tame old way with
the same poor results.
Our primary arithmetics are filled with mat
ter, the purpose of whicn seems to be to pro
vide so-called "busy work" for children, 'ihis
is supplemented by giving a mass of numerical
combinations, wnich may serve the purpose of
keeping the little ones busy and thus relieve
the overworked teacher, but tends to retard
true mental development- In many cases
young chilaren would be better busied in a
sand heap outride the school.
The thought that has been given to the
question oi an elementary course of study
during the past two years by many of the
teachers of the State is cause for gratification.
The belief that a carefully arranged selection
of material iv literature and history for all
grades as a means of developing character is a
growing one. The demand that our nature
study be adapted to the natural growth ol
child life is imperative. The interest mani
fested in manual training and the growing
conviction that this side of educational ac
tivity is a necessary Rdjunet from a pedagog
ical standpoint to any true system of educa
tion calls for careful consideration.
In conclusion, it seems eminently fitting
that we pause for a moment to pay a tribute oi
love and affection to the memory of one whose
loved voice we expected to hear at this meet
ing, but who has passed beyond the shadows
into the light of eternal day, giving her life a
sacrifice to her high sense of duly. In the
death of Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper California has
lost a noble woman, San Francisco an earnest
worker in evÂ«jry cause whose aim was the up
lifting of humanity, and every teacher a lov
ing triÂ«nd. She yet lives in the hearts of
thousands whose young lives her minis
trations have blessed. May her work, her
character, her life be an inspiration to us all.
The address was well delivered and at
its conclusion there was much applause.
After a short intermission the remainder
of the af tnrnoon was taken np with a dis
cussion under the auspices of the San
Francisco Teachers' Club. The question
under discussion was "Differentiation in
tbe Course of Study," two problems being
presented. The argument on the problem,
"Where Shall Differentiation Take Place
and How?" was led by Milton E.
Blanchard of the Lowell High School of
San Francisco. There was an able pres
entation of the matter, proposed changes
in tbe time allowed for tbe different
grades being presented. During the dis
cussion Silas White of San Francisco said:
"I should like to see tne call for cutting
the time of primary and grammar grades
come from teachers of those grades and
not from teachers of the high school. Any
haste in this direction, with the work we
must do, means bad results by and by."
To this Mr. Blanchard responded: "We
do not ask for hasty or imwrfect work in
the lower grades, but that the time wasted
in useless drudgery there be utilized and
the child sooner taught to use tbe time of
the lower grades in vocational work."
J. B. Hickman of Monterey asked:
"Would you bar pupils of grammar
grades from learning to collect and collate
work?"
"I mean only," replied Mr. Blanchard,
"to reduce the elementary work so tnat
the child will not consider that enough,
but will feel obliged to take the secondary
or truly educational work."
The consideration of the second prob
lem, "Manual Training Compared With
Vocational Training," was led by Frank
A. Gardner, principal at the San Francisco
Polytechnic High School. He paid a
glowing tribute to tbe value and practica
bility of the manual training system, and
tbe sentiments were much applauded.
In tbe discussion that followed County
Superintendent G. H. Stout of Butte said:
"i should like to see this body of teachers
express in a public way our de v ire that the
Legislature help us to establish manual
training-schools. The outlay would soon
be saved to the incalculable benefit to
young boys and girls by emptying our re
form schools."
"I should like to advocate a continua
tion of kindergarten work in our higher
schoolsâ work that all teachers can do,"
said Miss Kathrme Ball of San Fran
cisco.
C. H. Keyes of Berkeley called atten
tion to the fact that legislation has already
been attempted in California in the direc
tion of establishing manual training
schools. The measure referred to was
Senate bill 217, introduced in 1887 by Sena
tor Gesford. The speaker believed that
that the same bill would be presented in a
modified form at the coming session of the
Legislature.
Ex-State Superintendent John Swett
urged local effort in the direction of estab
lishing manual training work. "A coun
try school," he said, "could lay a sub
stantial foundation in this direction with
out much effort or expense. Local self
government and self-help would undoubt
edly be of great avail in this important
matter. With tbe great burden of State
taxes already heaped upon the people, it
may be impossible at present to secure
State aid for the establishment and main
tenance of manual training-schools."
Professor G. H. Howison ol the Univer
sity of California said the association
should not be hasty in giving an expres
sion in this direction. The plan, it was
urged, should be carefully matured before
it was presented with a view to securing
legislative action. Superintendent Stout
of Butte said it cost his county $4000 to
send one youne man to tbe State prison.
This would have been sufficient to main
tain a manual training school for some
time, and such a young man could no
doubt have been saved by such an institu
tion, idleness in this case bred discon
tent and criminality, as it did in the ma
jority of cases. P. M. Fisher, principal of
the Central School of Oakland, caused
much amusement at this point by saying
that the only two boys who were flogged
in his schooi this year were members of
the manual training class.
The session was closed by the president
with an earnest appeal for additional
membership in the association. After ad
journment many signed the roll and were
decorated with the yellow badges indicat
ing that they are members of the associa
tion. The total enrollment during the
day was nearly 600.
The reception this evening to the visit
ing teachers by the Slate Normal School
Alumni Association was a brilliant occa
sion. The Normal School throughout was
beautifully decorated, the work having
been done by the Santa Clara County
Floral Society. The great main hall to
ali available promenading space in the
building was taken advantage of by tne
throngs that attended. The exercises of
the evening were held in the main assem
bly hall of the school, and it was crowded.
James Carson, the president of the
Normal Alumni Association, presided at
the meeting. Professor C. H. Allen de
livered a:; address of welcome on behalf
of the city of San Jose. Professor A. H.
Randall, principal of tbe State Normal
School, welcomed the Teachers' Associa
tion on behalf of that institution. The
University of California was represented
among the speakers by Professor E. E.
Brown, and Professor Earl Barnes spoke
for Stanford University. The address of
welcome lrom the Alumni Association
was delivered by James Carson, the presi
dent, and was responded to on behnlf of
tne State Teachers' Association by Presi
dent J. W. Linscott of Santa Cruz.
The entertainment concluded with
dancing, and delicious refreshments were
served in three beautifully decorated
classrooms. All pronounced the occasion
one of the most enjoyable social events in
the history of the California Teachers'
Association.

tentions so' persistently upon Miss Maggie
Blake, a yoang dressmaker, that his ar

GOVERNOR BUDD'S MESSAGE.
Many Reforms Will Be Recommended to
the Coming Session of the Legis~
la tare.
STOCKTON, Cal., Dec. 28.â Governor
Butd has been here for the past few days
suffering from an attack of his old enemy,
rheumatism in his left arm, and he had
that member in a sling this morning. The
Governor has been very busy preparing
his message to the Legislature, which is to
convene next Monday. Tne document
will be lengthy and will recommend many
reforms. There is still a good deal of
work to be done on tbe message, but the
executive hopes to have it ready for the
State Printer on Friday and ready for sub
mission to the State's lawmakers ou Tues
day next at tbe latest. He manifested
considerable surprise when informed that
it had been reported that he contemplated
reorganizing the Harbor Commission o.
San Francisco, with a view to making it
non-partisan, though he would not deny
that such was his intention.
Governor Buud was asked what his pur
poses were with regard to Worden, the
Sacramento striker whom he respited a
short time ago that he might investigate
his case to determine whether or not it
would be well to commute his sentence
from hanging to life imprisonment. He
responded that be would not be able to
take the matter up until after the adjourn
ment of the Legislature, but that he would
recommend to the Legislature the enact
ment of a law the effect of which would
be that in the event of commuting Woi
den's sentence it could not be commuted
again, nor could the sentence of any other
criminal be commuted a second time un
less tbe petition should be signed by two
thirds of the members of the Supreme
Court.
The Governor will recommend a num
ber of reforms proposed by the Code Com
mission, among them the proposed law
making property under trust deeds re
deemable in the sunie manner as land sold
under foreclosure proceedings. . He will
also ask that a corporation tax be levied,
and will make some very startling recom
mendations with reference to the running
of State institutions.
The Governor left for Sacramento this
afternoon.
SALINAS' BEET FACTORY.

FINDS A TRUNK
FULL OF GOLD
Cached Coin Unearthed in
a Cemetery West of
Fresno.
Its Discoverer Believes He Has
Located Brigand Murietta's
Plunder.
Sheriff Timmins of the Opinion That
It Is the Product of a
Coiner's Mint.
FRESNO, Cal., Dec. 28.â Some man has
unearthed a trunk containing about
$150,000 in gold in the vicinity of the ceme
tery, a mile west of town. Who he is
cannot be learned, as only a few persons
know of the discovery and taey are main
taining the greatest secrecy. Tne lucky
finder and his friends believe they have
made a big sirike. There is no doubt that
their story is true, but there is a lurking
suspicion that they have found a quantity
of counterfeit coin.
J. G. Wofford, formerly a deputy con
stable in this city, is authority for the re
port of the discovery. To a Call corre
spondent to-day he exhibited a couple of
the bags in which the money was found
in the trunk. The imprint of the coins
could be seen plainly in the cloth, which
was ready to fall apart from ace. Mr.
Wofford stated that the money was all in
gold and amounted to about $150,000. He
stated that in his opinion the treasure had
been buried there years ago by Joaquin
Murietta, the noted outlaw of the early
days. The ex-officer believes that the
money is the plunder of some big robbery
by the daring brigand and that Vasquez
buried it on the plains for future use, or
probably because it impeded his flight.
According to Wofford's story, an old
Mexican who died recently told the per
son who afterward discovered the treasure
of its existence and the place where it
could be found. By a streak of fortune
the trunk was found in one of the first
diggings for it. Mr. Wofford refuses to
give any further particulars and will not
tell the name of the finders. The exact
point Ft which the trunk was found can
not be learned. Wofford gives the place
as being within a mile of the cemetery.
The ex-deputy Constable gives as his
reason for withholding further facts re
garding the find that it is not desired to
let the authorities know of it. The finder
and his friends had not secured legal ad
vice, and were under tne impression that
the State could confiscate half of the
treasure. This they desire to prevent by
not making the discovery known.
Of course there is a possibility that Wof
ford's friend has found a lortune, but
it is more probable that he discovered
counterfeit coin. Deputy Sheriff Timmins
statrd that a convict whom he had taken
to tbe State prison from this county had
told him while en route to the peniten
tiary that he knew where a trunk con
taining a large amount of counterfeit coin
was buried near this city. Tbe prisoner
said be would tell tne officer where it was
located when he should have served his
time. Timmins refused to divulge the
name of the convict. In all probability
this was the trunk that Wofford's friend
found.
FIRES AT HAT THIEVES.
Fresno Farmer Marks His Men and
1 hey Are Captured.
FRESNO, Cal., Dec. 28.â J. C. Garner,
who lives about eight miles west of town,
caught three men in the act of stealing
hay from his barn last night and "pep
pejed" them with bird shot. Mr. Garner
bad noticed for some time that the hay in
his loft was disappearing, and after some
investigation became convinced that
thieves were at work. He provided him
self with a shotgun, loaded it with small
shot and stood guard at night at the barn.
Last night his watchings were rewarded
by the appearance of three men in a
wagon. They backed the vehicle to the
door and were about to enter the barn to
throw the hay out when Garner fired.
He discharged both barrels at the tbree
men, who were standing in a bunch. The
men jumped from the wagon and ran for
life, clearing a barbed- wire fence in their
course with very athletic bounds. The
horses attached to the wagon took fright
and started to run away, but the lines
wound themselves around the wheels and
soon checked them.
Deputy Sheriff Timmins this morning
followed the tracks of the runaway men,
and they led to a place about a mile dis
tant. The three men were found there,
with their backs full of birdsbot, and the
officer arrested them as Garner's hay
thieves. They were taken before Justice
Austin this afternoon and gave $250 bail
each. None of the men are seriously in
jured. Their backs are riddled with shot,
which has just penetrated tbe skin.
GRAND JURORS IN SESSION.
Begin the Investigation of the Charge*
Against ' Sehtoeiztr.
FRESNO, Cal., Dec. 28.â The Fresno
County Grand Jury reconvened to-day
after an adjournment of two weeks. This
afternoon it began the investigation of the
case of Charles Schweizer, against whom
Deteciive Harrison and others are making
charges that he hired John Barker to
murder Solomon Lehmann last July. The
jury made little progress to-day. The
greater part of the afternoon was con
sumed in preparing subpenas for the wit
nesses. .
There have been no developments in
the case to-day. Lehmann has been ex
pected from Stockton, where he is en
gaged in carrying out a plowing contract,
but he has as yet failed to put in an ap
pearance.
SAN JOSE-FRESNO RAILWAY.
Syndicate Sails Its Bonds and Construction
of the Lne Will Soon Be
Commenced.
MONTEREY, Cal., Dec. 28.â Word was
received here yesterday from New York
that the bonds of the Monterey and Fresno
Railroad Company had been placed with
an Eastern syndicate. At the regular
annual meeting of the company to h&held
in January the name will be changed and
the whole project will be altered ma
terially from the first intention of the
present company. The board of directors,
however, will remain about the same.
The work of construction is to com
mence about Marcn 1, or just as soon as
the line can be permanently located from
San Jose to San Juan. The permanent
survey will be altered and will leave out
Monterey entirely. The syndicate pro
poses to ran the road from San Jose down
the Santa Clara Valley to San Juan, where
it will join the line to Hollister as at pres
ent located, thence running through the
Panoche Pass over the coast range to
Fresno City, nioKinp a distance of about
164 miles. Why such a great change
should occur could not be learned, but by
thosa best informed it is supposed to be
on account of anticipated trouble with a
company formed here lately to try to
undermine the present company and pro
cure its water-front franchise from the
city for other purposes.
Colonel Jones, the president of the rail
road company, has made twenty-three
trips across the continent in the past tour
years in tne interest of this road, and has
been in the East continuously for the past
eleven months trying to place the bonds
of the company. He has begun construc
tion tbree different times. At the last at
tetupt he succeeded in getting about eleven
miles of the road graded, but owing to the
failure of the construction company work
was abandoned in September a year ago.
SAM MAT EO`S AILING KINE
Two Veterinarians Accused of Inoculating
Tuberculous Cows to Deceive
Inspectors.
REDWOOD CITY, Cal.. Dec. 28.â Dr. I.
R. Goodspeed, the Board of Health In
spector of San Mateo County, appeared
before the Board of Sut>ervisors to
day in relation to the charges made some
time ago against his son, Edward Good
speed of San Mateo, and Dr. Kreeiey of
San Francisco. The two have been ac
cused of visiting the dairymen iv this
county ana for the sum of $1 per head in
oculating cows in such a manner that
when the inspector should make his offi
cial inspection the cows wouid fail to
show symptoms of tuberculosis. It is said
they would guarantee the resulting condi
tion to last for a period of six months.
Dr. Goodspeed denied any knowledge of
such a scnetue on the part of the persons
accused, or that he was in collusion with
them if there was. He appeared before
the board to answer any questions it
might desire to ask concerning the
charges which in a manner implicated
him, because hia son was one of tbe ac
cused parties.
On account of the imperfect legislation
relative to tbe health inspection laws, the
doctor stated, it was almost impossi
ble to do any effective work in the
line of inspecting the dairies, for the rea
son that they dare not kill the infected
cows after the test had been applied for
fear of criminal or civil prosecution after
ward. As there will probably be some
legislation on this subject at the coming
session of the Legislature, he and his
deputies, who had been receiving a regu
lar salary from the county, agreed to work
from now on until such legislation had
been passed without compensation.
NORDICA SNUBS TACOMA.
Cancels Her Engagement to Sing Solo
Parts in a Rendition of " The
Messiah. "
TACOMA, Wash., Dec. 28.âTheater
goers in Tacoma and other Northwestern
cities are very much provoked over Mme.
Nordica's cancellation of her engage
ments in the West, which is just an
nounced. Tacoma Fe&ttval Chorus has
been drilling for months for a rendition of
"The Messiah," with Nordica as soloist,
it being set for January 4. Professor Co
zine, who engaged Nordica on a $1250
guarantee, learned on Saturday that she
did not keep her engagement at Salt Lake,
where she was to sing in the Mormon
Tabernacle on Christmas night. The en
gagements at Seattle and Portland are also
canceled, and it is supposed here that her
Denver engagement h&3 been canceled.
The proceeds from the sale of seats in all
these cities aggregate about $15,000.
It is understood that Professor Cozine
proposes to bring a damage suit to recover
on tbe great expense he has bsen to in ad
vertising and preparing for Nordica's ap
pearance. It is supposed that Nordica's
action results from her recent change of
managers. Professor Cozine's arrange
ments were made with Ruben & Andrews
and Lee Wilson, her advance agent. Nor
dica has canceled her contracts with
these men, and is now being managed by
Klaw & Erlanger of New York, who to
day wired that Nordica had not the time
to come to the Northwest in response to
Mr. Cozine's offer of a guarantee for Ta
coma, Portland and Seattle.
Seattle Lumber Stills Closed.
SEATTLE, Wash., Dec. 28.â The otetson

number of biz lumber firms, caused the
shut-down. The concern has been en
gaged in sawing lumber since 1875.

SAN PEDRO'S PORT
IS ALWAYS SAFE
Thus Declares the Veteran
Master of the Bark
Theobald,
When Santa Monica Is Storm
swept, Ships Sail to the
Free Harbor.
Theories of tbe Hnntingtonians Dis
posed Of in a Sign:d State
ment.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Dec. 23.â During
the sitting of the Government Deep Har-
bor Commission on Saturday a statement
from C. F. Swan, master of the bark Theo-
bald, was submitted. Tnis communica
tion was not read in public, but it forms
part and parcel of the evidence which will
be considered by the commission. It is
one of the strongest arguments in favor
of San Peoro that has yet been submitted,
and as its author is an experienced sea
faring man, who has handled vessels on
Pacific Coast waters for the past thirty
years, the document will carry with it
great weight.
Captain Swan says that at times it is
impossible for vessels to land at Santa
Monica or Redondo. On these occasions
they proceed to San Pedro, where they
can always effect a landing. He disposes
of the Huntington contention that there
is no holding ground at San Pedro, and
sets at rest the fears expressed by the
tentacles of the octopus that shipping at
Ban Pedro was in constant danger from
sou'easters. Captain Swan'a full state
ment follows:
RAX Francisco, Dec. 21, 1896.
To ihe Honorable Boat d of Deep Sea Commis
sioners: Learning that your honorable com
mission is now investigating the harbors of
San Pedro and Santa Monica, I take the liberty
of writing you, giving & few personal observa
tions concerning them derived from a thirty
years' navigating experience oa the Pacific
Coast.
From the Straits of Fuca south to San Diego
there is not a harbor a ship can enter in bad
we&ther or when in distress, for they are bar
harbors, -with moving sands both outside and
inside of the bars. The greatest difficulty
met by engineers, and which has caused them
close study, has been to confine the channels
and tides in some narrow, straight direction,
so as to deepen the channel, which has cost
the Government large sums of money.
Some twenty years ago. it wasnotuncom-
bar- bound from four to
moo for a ship to be
mx weeks on the Columbia River; now, they
are seldom bar-bound longer than from eight
to ten days. During the time I have navigated
the Pacific Coast, I have known five different
channels at the month of the Columbia River;
one of these has in later years been converted
into an iÂ«iand. Along the entire coesi like
changes have proportionately taken place.
There are some fourteen or fifteen outside
landings between San Francisco Riid San Diego
that have wharves built â¢out, about the same
as that atÂ£edondo. At these wharves steam
ers and sailing vessels land and discharge, ex-
cept during heavy weather, when it is impos
sible for a vessel to make a landing at any of
the wharves along the coast. When steamers
and sailing vessels caunot land at Santa
Monica or Redondo, they proceed to San Pedro,
where they can make a landing.
Out of any of the fourteen outside laudiDgs
along the coast at not one of them has there
been so much trouble as at Santa Monica Bay
with the wharves. Not a winter passes but
more or less damage has been done to either the
wharf or vessels, and sometimes to both yes-
sels and wharf.
Two years ago the sands were washed away
from the inner end of the wharf, destroying
that part, but leaving at Redondo the outer
end standing, and had it not been for the
stanchness ;and great care which has been
taken of the Santa Monica wharf that would
have gone, too. If a wharf should be extended
out lrom any outside port ha.f the distance
that Santa Monica wharf is it would answer jus t
as well as that at the latterplace, for they would
be equally exposed to their greatest enemy,
the west and southwest sea on this coast.
It is not the southeast winds that do the
damage on the coast and make our bars and
landings rough; it Is after the wind changes
to the west and southwest that there are blows
of the greatest fury at times. If we should
get a southwest gale, such as vre nave fre
quently had on the coast, ships now at Santa
Monica would be scattered alone the beach
and neither pioperty nor lives be saved.
Southeast gales blow about two or three points
off shore at san Pedro and about six or beven
points at Santa Monica Bay, while in San la
Barbara Channel the regular southeast gale
blows a little off land. Experience teached
that nothing less than a properly buiit dock
will answer.
At Calao, Peru, 'a French company's first in
tention was to run a breakwater north and
couth, thinking that a vessel could lie iuside,
but it was found that the breakwater in
creased the undertow to such an extent that it
wat impossible to hold any vessel at ai!. So
they built a dock closed in all around, leaving
a narrow entrance to the north, and yet the
undertow is so great that at times it is impos
sible to hold a ship so as to discharge or load.
The dock company furnish all ships with las
tenings and hare at hand a crew of men for
the purpose of mooring and unmooring ships.
A breakwater run out in any direction where
the bottom is of a quicksand nature And
where there is no current running in any
straight direction to keep the harbor open
and in place, the whole would in time grow
into a peninsula. For an example, see the
east arm of San Pedro harbor, where a break
water was run out to Dead Mans Island for
about two miles and when completed had
blue water on both sides and now H is grow
ing sands to the east.
In no place on the coast has there been such
substantial work done by thÂ«< Government in
improving the harbor as has been done at
San Pedro. When they commenced to im
prove thiÂ« harbor there was about four feet of
water on the bur; now there Is eighteen feet,
ana it is deepening all the time. Pcint Fermin
runs out in a southerly direction, which
affords protection to the bur from westerly
swells and causes the course of the current to
be the same year in and year out. The rocky
reef extending out from Point Fermin offers
excellent foundation for a breakwater, and
with the same harbor regulations as to moor-
Ing ships San Pedro to-day would be a better
harbor than Valparaiso. One is open to the
north, the Pacific Ocean, and the other to the
south. San Pedro is sheltered from the worst
seas on the Pacific Coast.
I read in the newspapers a statement made
by C. P. Huntington, at Washington, D. C,
concerning the two places, in which he said
there was no holding ground at San Pedro,
whereas, the truth is the bottom Is just about
the same there as it is at Sant* Monica, being
a little more rocky, which the chart will show
It is very true that two or three ships have
gone ashore there, but that cannot be
attributed to bad holding ground. The ships
America and Kennebeck, which went ashore,
were deep water vessels, and on arriving at
San Pedro they discharged their crews, and at
that time that port had no pilot or harbor
master to acquaint strangers with the port or
order the proper mooring of vessels. When
the breeze sprung up, the mate of the America
lifted the compressor on the windlass, to give
the vessel chain, thinking the end was made
fait, and when the rattling of the chain
stopped he looked over the bow and discovered
that the anchor and chain had leUiuia. The
ship then swung around and beai her way in
over the bar with one anchor on the Dow. She
is running to-day.
The Kennebeck went ashore also -with one
anchor on the bow, but was afterward raised.
She is running also to-day. The masters of
both vessels were on shore at the time of the
accidents, while there was no crew on either
vessel. The ships swung to a land breeze In the
night and to the sea breeze ia the day, in this
way louling their anchors and cau&ing them
to drag. Respectfully submitted,
C. F. Swan, Master Bark Theobald.
During all of last week the Harbor
Board listened to disquisitions as to
every variety of sou'eastcrs ever designed
by tne combined imaeinations of several
Southern Pacific engineers for special
duty at San Pedro. Huntington's "re
tained" men started out with the as
sumption that a sou'easter at. San Pedro
was as much to be dreaded as a Kansas
cyclone. Whenever the occasion pre
sented itself they brought forward these
dreaded sou'easters â big and little, long
and short, with or without rain. Sou'
easters have been described and ex
patiated upon times without numbsr.
Small wonder, therefore, that when the
gentle patter of rain and the sighiugs of a
southeast gale were heard early this
morning the hearts of the Commissioners
were glad. With one acclaim they said,
"Now is our time to see the workings of a
real, live southeaster at San Pedro." In
stead, therefore, of resuming the hearings
.in the great harbor fight this forenoon,
as was the plan at adjournment hour last
Saturday, the board hied itself to the sea
shore in a blinding rainstorm.
When it was announced to the crowd
at the Chamber oi Commerce that tbe
commas. on had gone to San Pedro the
friends of tnat port were jubilant. "That's
eood," obstrvea J. F. Francis; "they will
have an object lesson." A Long Beach
man just in frcm the coast declared the
wind was blowing strongly from the south
east and the surface of the water was per
fectly smooth. This was encouraging to
the San Pedroites, and they smiled but
toned up their coats and prepared to face
tbe storm that had by this time increased
in violence. The Eanta Monica partisans
were quite as cheerful as their friends.
The reports from the long wharf were that
everything was lovely down there.
The commission was accompanied on
the trip by Engineers Hawgood and Moore
for San Pedro and Corthell and Hood of
the Southern Pacific Tbe commission
upon reaching San Pedro was greatly dis
appointed. The deadly sou'easter was
nowhere. The rain was pourinz down in
torrents, accompanied by only a gentle
hreeze. The citizens of San Pedro in
formed the board that at an earlier hour
there was almost a gale, but that later it
had calmed. The bay was almost as
placid as a lake on a summer's morning.
Hood's raging Dillows were nowhere in
sight.
The board returned partway and then
branched off to Santa Monica. Tne waters
about Uncle Collis' wharf showed little
agitation and the day was lost so far as
results were concerned. In the afternoon
the clouds broke away and Old Sol from
bis eminence seemed to smile upon the
discomfiture of tbe board.
The hearing wiil be resumed to-morrow
forenoon. *
TRAGEDY AT SPOKANE.
Kittie Edmunds, Late of the Variety
Stage, Ends Her Life With Car

SPOKANE, Wash., Doc. 28.â Kittie Ed

drauk tbe contents of a two-ounce bottle
of carbolic acid last night and died a half
hour later. The deed was committed in
her rooms, 20 and 21, Eagie block.
Somsthing of a mystery is connected
with the tragedy. At first it was reported
that she had taken the acid accidentally,
mistaking it for a tonic which she had
been using. This theory seems hardly
borne out by the facts. There are discrep
ancies in the various stories told, and there
is evidently a desire oa the part of the
people aware of the facts to keep them

Kittie Edmund.? has been a well-known
ficure in Spokane for the past three years.
She came here as a variety actress, but
had been off the stage for many months.
She bad been living quietly in tne Eagle
block. The prominence of her sUte.r, Mrs.
Gorkow, brought about by tbe sensational
developments in the celebrated Gorkow
wiil case, gave Miss Kittie some promi
nence also. She was a young woman, not
more than 25 years old. Her home was In
Oakland or Benicia, Cal. She had a
younger sister living here. Her true name
was Kittie McKenzie, and her father was
a policeman in San Francisco.
Her sister, Mrs. Gorkow, was first known
here with Kittie under the stage name of
the Edmunds Sisters. Later Helene mar
ried R. Garkow, a rich brewer. Kittie re
mained on the variety stage after this,
acting with Helen Addis, a sister of Lady
feholto Douglas. Helene Gorkow has come
into great . prominence by contesting the
Uorkow will. One lawyer has already
been killed, a Judge openly charged with
bribery, and a third man Â«ccu<Â«ed of per

SANTA ROSA. Cal., Dec. 28.â Frank
Colby, accused of having been tlje masked
robber who attempted to rob a store at
Bodega recently, has been held to answer
before the Superior Court by Justice Cun

ward, inflicting a serious but not danger
ous wound. The lantern in the room was
extinguished. Smith shot at Morales but
missed him, and he escaped with one shoe
on. It is believed he has gone to Mexico-
Morales is a bad man and declares he
will never be taken alive, He is wanted
for killing a man at Santa Anita last sum

CO TEST OF THE BELL WILL
Judge Clark Decide* That He Cannot
Adjudicate the JUapute.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Dec 28.â Judge
Clprk to-day rendered an opinion in the
suit contesting the will of the late John C
Bell. It appears that Bell was married to
his wife, Elizabeth, in 1852. In 1878 they
were divorcee, and on June 20, 1896, were
remarried. Before wedding Bell the sec
ond time Elizabeth had him deed to her
a lot in the Wolfskill Tract, and on June 1
he executed a will, staling that he was
about to remarry bis former wife,restoring
to her the riirhts of descendants and ap
pointing her executrix. On June 4 he
made another will, which gave her one
third of his property, but appointed
Jerome Austin and Sam B. Dewey ex
ecutors.
Judge Clark holds that it is not in the
province pf the Probate Court to decide
the matter, and must be settled in a court
of equity. He al?o holds that the marriage
would revoke the will unless there was
some special agreement in relation to the
matter in the marriage contract, wbich
was not the case in tbe present instance.

SAN DIEGO THE TERMINUS.
Transcontinental Railway May Be Built
to the Southern California
Port.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Dec. 28.â Philip
Morse, president of the Chamber of Com
merce, received a letter to-day from E. C.
Potter of Chicago, who has undertaken to
organize a company for the establishment
of a steamship line between San JJiego
and the Orient, in which Mr. Potter ex
presses gratification over ths efforts being
put forth by the citizens ot this city to
mfeke the proposed line a success.
"The broad and splendid spirit of your
city," writes Mr. Potter, "ha* made rue a
firm and devoted friend of ban Diego. Of
the lukewarmness of Los Angeles I have
little to say."
Mr. Potter, who is at present in Chicago,
states that he wiil leave within a few days
for the .East for consultation with the
capitalists who have signified a willing
ness to capitalize the steamship company.
'â¢The good will of San Diego," said Mr.
Potter, "will have great weight with
them." He says that the outlook for tbe
project Is brighter than ever and speaKs
of it as already an assured success. San
Die jo, in his opinion, will be required to
raise only a small amount in the way of
stock subscription.
The most interesting portion of Mr.
Potter's letter, however, relers to a move
ment that has been set on foot by Chicago
capitalists and associatas in New York to
build a transcontinental railroad to San
Diego, avoiding the Raton and other h:gh
passes of the Rocky Mountains. From
information received it is understood that
the line extending from Cnicaso soutn
we^terly and across tne Panhandle of
Texas, and at present having its terminus
in the eastern part of New Mexico, is to be
built on to this city via Phoenix.
At tbe latter city the entnusiasm over a
line straight through to S;in Diego is
more apparent than it has ever been be
fore. The road from Gaiveston, extend
ing in the direction of Deminer, N. Mex.,
and having its present terminus at San
Angelo, Tex., is also beaded directly lor
tan Diego. That this port has been de
cided upon as a terminus of a transconti
nental line is an open secret iti Cnicago,
and this fact more than anything else ia
responsible for the movement to establish
a line of Oriental steamships, vrith San
Diego as the American port.
HELD IN A MEXICAN PRISON.
American Citizen Soon to Be Released,
After a Period of Unwarranted
Captivity.
SAN iJIEGO, Cal., Dec 28.â Americans
throughout Mexico are watching with
great interest the movements of the
authorities in the case of Carlos A. Miller,
an American citizen and resident of
Cuajinicuilanan, State of Guerrero. He
is in Belim prison. City of Mexico,
charged with the murder of a Mexican
engineer named Eduaro Zepeda at Omete
pec on October 6.
Miller claimed from the first that the
local officers at Ometepcc and in bis own
town with the unpronounceable name
had conspired to bring a murder charge
against him and encompass his ruin and
death if possible. He claims he knows
the identity of the murderers, and offers,
if released under guard, to furnish evi
dence of a wholesale conspiracy in the
State of Guerrero not only to do away
with him, but to defraud the Government
out of a large amount.
Reputable people of the State have for
warded to the Government statements
setting forth that Miller is all right and
is the intended Victim of enemies in pub
lic places. Hon. Imiacia Mariscal, Secre
tary o! Foreign Affairs, has investigated
Miller's case somewhat, and is convinced
of bis innocence. He has noiified the
Atner.can legation to that effect. It is
probable, therefore, tha- Miller wiil soon
be released.
In ttie meantime, on orders from Presi
dent Diaz, a rigid investigation is going
on in the Sta;e of Guerrero, unearthing
scandals in public offices and running
down the murderer? of Engineer Zepeda.
UPRISING OF THE YAQUI.
Mexican Troops Unable to Make Head-
way Aga.nst the Mountain
Insurgents.
SAN DIEGO. Cal., Dec. 28.â The
steamer Pacheco, arriving lroni the south,
brings news of another expedition soon
to be sent out against the Yaquls, to re
enforce that already in the held under
General Laise Torres, commandant of the
First Military Zone. The gathering of
the hosMles near Nogales is only part of
another insurrection that promises to in
clude all the Yaquis along the Yaqui and
M:iyo rivers, ana. in ihe Siena de Baca
tete.
These Indians are now armed with mod
ern rifl-s and i.ava displayed a cunning in
mountain warfare exce linir that of the
Apache. The Mexican troops thus far
have been unable to get at any consider
able body of Indians, as they scatter and
seek the hills when approached by a large
force. In this respect they employ the
tactics so successfully used by the Cuban
insurgents.
When last heard from, General Torres
was in the wild country southeast of Ures,
penetrating still further towards the
V gui strongholds. He has displayed
belter sidll in fighting the Yaqui than any
commander yet sent against them.
LOPROTING MEXICAN HARBORS
Government to Expend Large Sum* on
I'aeiftc C> aft Port*.
SAN DIEGO. Cal., Dec. 28.â The Mexi
can Government recognizing the increas
ing importance of its west coast commerce
is determined to improve the harbors.
Arrangements have b>en made to raise a
considerable sum for thi-< important work,
in addition to the $5,000,000, for the im
provement of Coaizarnalcos and Saiina
Cruz, the Eastern and Western termini of
the Teh a mite pec roau.
The move to improve the harbors is al?o
caused, tt is said, by the rapidity of rail
road buildinir toward the Mexican Pacific
coast which will open up fertile country
and develop a large commerce through the
ports below Mazatlan.
In accordance with the Government's
plans an eminent engineer, Arthur F.
Wrotnowski, has been sent to the West
ern coast to inspect all of the harbors and
determine which shall be improved and
to what extent. Wrotnowski has been in
Mexico about thirty years, much of the
time in the employ of the Government on
large works.
SANTA BARBARA COUNTY OIL.
Another Strike Made at the Occidental
Company* Tunnel,
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Dec 28.â
Superintendent Fisher of the oil tunnel
eight mileÂ» from this city reported to-day
to the Occidental Company, which con
trols the tunnel, that another strike had
been made, increasing the flow to twenty
five barrels a day. A few days ago the
superintendent had some small experi
mental holes drilled to locale the vein.
From these oil almost in its purity spurted
forth in large quantity, doubting the
former flow. Tiie company intends fol
lowing up this vein, hoping to find an
artery equal to any that flows from the
heart of the Alleghanies.

TO PAY COYOTE
SCALP CLAIMS
State Examiners Dsclare
in Favor of a Large
Appropriation.
Recommend That N2arjy Three
Hundred Thousand Dollars
Be Granted.
Various Bil s Against the Common
wealth Are Passed Upon by
the Board.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Dec. 28.â The
State Board of Examiners, represented by
Secretary of State Brown and Secretary
Markley, met to-day and recommended
that $287,000 be appropriated for tbe pay
ment of the coyote scalp claims, and that
tbe Attorney-General be requested to
draw up a bill providing for such investi
gation into the legality of the claims pre
sented for payment as may be deemed
necessary.
It was decided to recommend Major
Ramon Pioo's claim to the Legislature in
tne .sum of $8111 15. This amount is
claimed to be due for tbe equipping of a
company during the Civil War.
W. W. Foote's claim of $1535 for attor
ney fees in defending tbe action brought
by John C. Lynch against Governor Budd
to determine the executive's right to ap
point Lieutenant-Governor Millard's suc
cessor was approved.
When tbe expense account for tbe
funeral of Dana Perkins, late State
Librarian, in the sum of $1102 08, was
brought up, it was deemed advisable to
lay the matter over until a full board was
present.
J. J. Slaten of Monterey County put in
a claim for $100 for the arrest and con
viction of E. W. Riley for keeping a
saloon open on election-day. Slaten
claims the reward uuder the proclama
tion of tbe Governor. Tbe provision in
the Penal Code relative to selling liquor
on eleotion-day was held by the board not
to have been included in tbe proclama
tion, and the claim was not allowed.
A communication was received from
tbe Bureau of Highways relative to
allowing a rebate ot $il3 to M. E. Kennan,
a Stockton street contractor. It appears
t.- at when Kennan applied to the bureau
for information as to the price of crushed
rock he was informed that it woul < be
furnished for 25 cents a ton. Afterward
the Prison Directors concluded to charge
$1 a car for switching, and as Kennan had
purchased 113 carloads of rock he lelt that,
having received no notification of switch
ing charges he should not be made to pay
them. This switching fund does not go
into the rock-crushing fund, bot into the
maintenance fund of the prison. The
members of the bureau say that as far as
ascertained there has been collected
during the past four months $1102, and
they claim that it has certainly not cost
that much to operat- the switch-engine,
leaving a profit to the State which they
claim shonld pass into tbe rock* crushing
fund.
LANDSBOROUGH'S SHORTAGE.
The Assemblyman-Elect Claims the
Amount Is Small and Refunds a
Stated Sum.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Dec 28.â 1t is
said that tbe Grand Jury, which bad ad
journed until tbe third Monday in Janu
ary, reconvened to-day to investigate thor
oughly tbe affairs of L. M. Landsborougb,
Deputy County Clerk, who has been at
tempting to increase his $75 per month
salary by raising the value of jurors' de
mands for fees against the county and
pocketing the difference. Landsborough
claims that tbe whole amount of bis de
falcation is but $143 50, and this sum he
has refunded to the County Cleric. His
friends claim that he never intended to
appropriate the money to his own use,
but tii'at it was siciply to be used until be
could uec bis $8 per day fees as Assembly
man and that he intended to return the
money to ttie county treasury.
If L. M. Landsborough should resign
his seat in the Legislature the vacancy
wuuld have to be filled, if at all, by a
special election, the Governor having no
power to appoint. Under the old law ttie
Governor could call a special election by
issuing an election proclamation ten days
prior to tbe day of election, but this has
been c anged by tne Australian baliot
law, which supersedes all laws heretofore
in existence relating to ejections. Under
the Australian ballot system the procla
mation must be issued at least thirty days
pr.or to the day of election. This being
ttie case ttie session would be naif over
before a successor to Mr. Landsborongh
couid be chosen, and the chances are that
no effort wilt be made to fill tbe vacancy,
should one exist.
COLGAN REPLIES TO BROWN
Insists That the Yountviile Veterans' Home
Appropriation Was Made
Legally.
BACKAMESTO, Cal., Dec. 28. â The
controversy between Controller Coigan
and Secretary of State Brown as to the le
gality of appropriating and paying $60,000
to the Yountviile Soidiers' Borne is as yet
unsettled. In an interview to-day Con
troller Coigan said:
â¢'Secretary oi State Brown, in reply to
my statement regarding the appropriation
for the Veterans' Home at Yountville,
published in the last Sunday Call, says
that he does not consider the case of
Daggeit vs. Coigan, involving the World's
Fair appropriation, a parallel case. It is
a case directly in point, and the court in
its decision says that it will taice judicial
note of the fact that the World's Colum
bian Exposition will not be conducted
under the exclusive management and con
trol of this State as a State institution,
but, on the contrary, that the same will be
under the general management of the
National Commission, and that the chief
agency relied upon to effect the desigu of
Congress is a private corporation of the
State of Illinois, etc Notwithstanding
these facts the court held the State appro
priation to be legal and valid. Could
anything be more strongly in favor of the
legality of the appropriation for the Vete
rans' Home?
"I wish, it to be distinctly understood
that I am not taking issue with Secretary
Brown as to the advisability of these ap
propriations, but as to their legality there
can be no question. It is admitted that the
lands of the home are the property of the
Veterans' Home Association, but the con
duct of the institution is sufficiently under
the control of the State to bring it within
tne purview of the constitution as a State
institution.
"Mr. Brown is also quoted as having
said in his interview that the cottages
at the Yountville home were not erected
unde- State control, nor was the contract ;
of 1376 complied with. He said: 'Tais
law specifically provides that full and ac- |
curate plans, showing ail details of the !
work to be performed in constrnetine or
improving any Siate building, when they
exceed the sum of |3000. with full speciti- I
cations, bills of material and estimates of j
the cost thereof, shall be submitted to the I
Governor, State Treasurer and Secretary j
of State for their approval, and If so ap- j
prove l copies thereoi shall be filed in the ;
Controller's office. The plan 3 shall then ;
be advertised for four weeks and sealed |
proposals submitted. This was never |
done, nor have the bills of the institution j
ever been audited by the Board of Exam
iners.'
"In this statement Mr. Brown is whoily j
mistaken. Tne directors of the home ,
have complied in every particular with
the provisions or this law; contracts for â 
all the work approved by the Attorney- ;
General are on tile in this cilice, and no;
one dollar of pit her appropriation was j
paid from the State Treasury until after
the bills had been audited and approved
by the State Board of Examiners. I have
no desire to carry this controversy any |
further. I thin* I have shown sufficient
authority for the expenditure of tde legis
lative appropriations mid that said appro
priations were within the constitutional
limitation. Mr. Brown's report certainly
reflected on the conduct of this office,
whether intentionally or otherwise, and I
merely wish to pJace myself right jviih
the public"

SACRAMENTO, Cal., D^c. 28.âCon

POUND THE BEAR THACKS
Anderson's Terrible Encounter in the
.Mountains of Colorado.
A prospector named Anderson, who is
working on a claim near the Tarn O'Shan
ter group of mines, fought a terrific battle
with a large black bear the other day, the
story of whiob is told by the Ashcroft cor
respondent of the Aspen (Colo.) Tribune.
Anderson came out victor, but it was a
painful victory and he will bear some of
the marks of the engagement with him to
the crave.
Anderson started out early in the after
noon with a dog and Winchester rifle
to hunt, bear tracks having been report
ed within a few miles of the mines. He
and the dog picked up the tracks and
trailed them for about three miles, when
they became fresher, and tbe dog bayed
the" fact that he had tbe scent. The
mow was quite deep, and Anderson
plunaed through, taking litt c or no pre
caution to see where be was goinir. He
was suddenly arrested by a howl of pain
from the doe, and looked up only to be
confronted by an enormous bear that had
swatted the canine one and sent it howl
ing toward its master. The bear squatted
on its haunches waiting for Ander&on to
open tbe light.
The man recovered from his astonish
ment quickly, and raising his rifle fired at
random and started to retreat. In doing
so bis foot caught in dome brush and
he fell. Bruin, hit and maddened at the
pain, was over the prostrate man in
an instant, and then came a life-and
death strugsle. Man and bear rolled over
and over. The dog proved a valuable ally
to Anderson, and worrieu Bruin consider
ably by biting his bind legs. So aggra
vating did the dog become that the bear
turne.i its attention from tbe man to its
tormentor. It was a fatal movement for
the be .r, as it gave Anderson an oppor
iunity to get out a hunting-Knife he car
ried, and when bruin turned asain the
man closed in with the animal and buried
the knife in its breast. Bruin fell over
dead and Anderson dropped exhausted.
The man's clothing was literally torn from
him and nun? in shreds. His face, head,
body, bands, arms and legs were terribly
lacerated, and it wiil be several weeks be
fore he will bant bears again. The bear
weighed 220 pounds.
In Greece, in the t ird century b. c, the
wearing of silk was forbidden to women,
the husbands of those who violated the
law being heavily lined, or the theory
that a husband ought to be able to control
his wife's taste for hnery.

1 2 THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALLNIOBE`S TEARS
AROUSE MIRTH
The Alcazar Company
Makes a Hit in Fan
tastic Comedy.
"His Wife's Father" Produced
by the Frawleys to a
Large House.
A Clever Young Local Actor Appears
at the Grand in "Across the
Potomac."
The audience at the Alcazar was kept in
a state of chronic mirth last night by the
Paultons' fantastic comedy, "Niobe,"
which titled the stock company better
than anything it has yet attempted.
"Niobe," which is not unknown to San
Franci>co theater-goers, tells how an an
tique Greek statue comes to life in tbe
house of a New York merchant, and
causes serious trouble in the household.
The idea is borrowed from Guthrie An
stey's "Tinted Venus," but tbe develop
ment of tbe plot bears no resemblance to
that humorous little story.
In "Tbe Tinted Venus," the wretched
man on whom the Venus fixed her affec
tions, is not married, but in "Niobe"
Peter Amos Dunn is very much married,
as most of bis wife's relations not only
obtain free board and lodging in his home
but also cause discord in the family circle.
A statue maniac millionaire friend a*ks
.Dunn to give houseroom to his priceless
Greek Niobe for a few days, and while
Dunn's wife and her relations are at the
theater the electric wires used for light
ing her alcove become heated and the
Niobe is burnt into consciousness. Dunn
has no hope that this story will be be
lieved, so he passes off the artless Niobe
as* the new governess, and the young
lady's Greek manners and customs are the i
cause of- horror and discord in the Dunn I
household.
The honors of the performance were '
carried off by George Osborne, Beatrice j
Lieb and Mrs. Bates. Miss Lieb's posings
and mannerisms, which hamper her in !
other parts, do her great service in the i
role of the Niobe, and her unusually tall,
statuesque figure makes her look the psrt |
to the life. She walks and poses and â 
talks exactly as one would imagine an !
animated statue would do.
Perhaps she studied her attitudes too i
much, but she always posed gracefully, !
and in her classic costumes, with her slow,
majestic movements, she makes'the other
women on the stage, with their balloon
sleeves and small waists, look common
place and unpicturesque. For the first j

Debut at the Grand Opera-
Hocsc Last Night.
time since she has played with the Alca- J
zar company Miss Lieb deserved hearty
arrplause, and last night 9he reieived it in
tbe shape of numerous recalls.
Goorge .O3borne gives a very humorous j
rendering of Dunn's role, and it islareely j
owing to his vim and intelligence that the |
- fun is so fast and furious. Mrs. Bates, as
Dunn'* elderly and austere sister-in-law,
contributes largely to the mirth of
"Niobe." Miss May Buckley clays her
little role ol tiie sister-in-law in her usual
pretty, natural fashion. John Armstrong
gives a good characterization of Parker G.
Silox,|a merchant who does not appreciate
antique statues, and Francis Powers is

Columbia Theater.
A large audience welcomed that clever
comedy of Martha Morton's, "His Wife's
Father," at the Columbia Theater last night.
The cast was practically the same as on its
first production by the Frawley company
'some months ago, except that Maclyn \r
buckle played the role of Maynard Langdon
lut night and played it well.
Carson Clarke wan as funny as ever in the
part of Buchanan Bill mrs, the too-fond father,
who embittered the happiness of his children
through an excess of affection. Frank Worth
ing renewed his former success a? the son-in
law, and the rest of the cast was up to its for
mer standara.
On Thurnday night I 'The Great Unknown"

"The Brownies" drew a large honse at the

Grand Opera-Houae.
"Across tne Potomac." which wu played
laat night, is an interesting military melo
drama of tbe stirring time of the Civil War.
Howard Kyle represented the Northern offi
cer well, and he was especially effective in the
â econd act, when the Northern army attacks
the Confederate quarters, and a fierce engage
ment ensues, in wnich he is oadly wounded.
General Heath of the C. 8. A. wag well played
by Fred Butler, who received quite an ovation
on his reappearance.
He wore his gray uniform well and looted
every inch a soldier. Walter Tessler took the
part of Jttck Handford and played it well, and
Victory Bateman was clever and natural In
the role of Madge Hanford.
Bert Morrison, a young San Franciscan, the
eon of a well-known newspaper man, made
his debut an the C. 8. A. courier, and gave
good promise of success in the profession he
has chows. He Is possessed of a clear, ex-
Sressive voice, his stage presence is good and
c acts cleverly and intelligently.
At thn Orpheuni.
The Orpheum it giving about the best show
tbe management has ever put before its
patrons. The quantity is most liberal, but the
quality did not suffer on tnat account. Every
item deserved and received applause last
night. Abrachi and Masand, the latest addi
tion to the bill, did some marvelous acrobatic
feats. It would seem difficult to find any
thing new in the way of human contortion,
but the gyrations of these two certainly hud
the appearance of novelty. The ballet has
greatly improved in uniformity and graceful
action, and the air full of butterflies gives one
an idea of what the worid looked like in the
pre-Adamite timeÂ«.when insects weighed 150
pounds and reptiles were as long as the Mo
Kinley procession. . .
Tivoll Opera-Home.
"Jack and the Beanstalk" continues to fill
the Tivoli with enthusiastic audiences which
insist on encore after encore. The ballets are
going very smoothly and the transformation
scenes arouse plenty of applause.
At the Chute*.
The rain rather dampened things out at the
Chutes yesterday, but the present list ol at
tractions serves to draw big crowds on pleas
ant occasions. R. M. Brown, the one-legged
cyclist, is the latest sensation, and the war in
which he coasts down the chutes and lands in
the lake on his wheel is remarkable.
Korto continues to walk down the chutes on
his globe, and the animntoscope is constantly
supplied with new sceues.
The Circus Royal.
Oscar R. Gleason, the horse-tamer, is giving
a series of striking exhibitions at the corner
of MaÂ«on and Eddy streets, and his audiences
are growing larger every evening.
Last night one of his subj cts was a most
unruly horse irom the stock yards and it
took fifty minutes before he was subjugated.
In i he meantime Gleason received a severe
kick in the arm and it was necessary for him to
show his superiority over the animal by grasp
ing him by the neck, wrestling with him,
throwing him and finally sitting on his necK.-
Then the horse was driven around the ring

of the Coroner of San Francisco who held an

While It la true that "Ynnkee Sullivan" was
Known Id tan Francisco as J- ranch Murray lii.s
true name was frank Ambrose. I knew him for
several years previous to his second trip to Califor

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 29, 1896.
NOW SCOTS DROP
INTO POETRY
Trying to Outdo Burns
Himself for the Mon
ument.
Rev. Dr. Mackenzie Expresses
Himself as Heartily in
Favor of It.
Thinks That Not Scotchmen Alone
but Men of Other Nationalities
Will Jala the Movement.
Rev. Dr. Robert Mackenzie, pastor of
the First Presbyterian Church, in an inter
view yesterday declared himsslf ready to
enlist in the movement for a monument
to Robert Burns.
"There is no character in the history of
Scotland that so appeals to all human
kind is that of Robert Burns," he said.
"Burns is not a man of one country, but
of all countries. A monument to him is a
monument to bumanitarianism.
"I do not care to figure in the move
ment in its inception. I would rather let
others do that. But I stand ready, how
ever, to do what I can. I am heartily in
favor of the project and have read all that
has been said of it in The Call witn much
interest.
"Burns is a permanent figure in the
world's list of great men. His worics
blotted out would leave a sad gap in lit
erature. He' wrote to the hearts of men
as no other has written.
"It is a fitting thing, therefore, that men
who have the right to call themselves his
countrymen should have to place a mon
ument in the park to do him honor. It
would add an attractiou to the park and
serve, as do all such marKs to great men,
as an object-lesson to children and to
men. I do not believe, however, that
Scotchmen would be left alone to do the
work. They are chiefly interested, of
course, but. as I have said, Burns is a
world character, with ardent admirers
among men of all nationalities capable of
understanding and appreciating his work.
"These, lam sure, will lend a willing
hand in putting up a monument worthy
of Burns and worthy of San Francisco and
worthy of its beautiful park. Yes, say I
am in favor of the monument and that I
stand ready to aid in making it a reality
in whatevpr way I can."
A monument enthusiast has broken into
soug upon the subject after the following
fasuion. The poetry is scarcely entitled
to place along with that of Bobbie Burns,
but it may serve its own purpose:
APPEAL, FOR A MONUMENT TO BOBERT

And set them up in some fine apot,
.Marked wi: li the name
Of him who sweetly sung and wrote

THE MIRADO AND HIS WIFE.
An Incident in Royal Life in
Japan.
A refreshing little incident occurred dur
ing their stay at their old home, the pal
ace of Kioto. Together they rambled
through the wardens, recalling their early
days among the familiar trees and shrubs,
and we are told that the Empress was in
vited to go up the stairs of the "Shishin
der," the august audience-hall where the
Mikado of old used to administer public
affairs, and where no female had yet set
foot.
It is their daily custom to dine together
in the evening, and undemonstrative as we
naturally are, it is said that no sign is
wanting to show that they enjoy more
than their share of conjugal felicity. Re
ports also say that there never was a
woman truer to the old teachings in re
spect to the womanly disposition and de
meanor.
Space would not allow us to narrate
even what little we know of the daily life
of the Empress. Those who have had tne
pleasure of seeing the suite of imperial
chambers will be able to surmise that
there is more or leas of compromise be
tween the foreign or native in the style of
living in the imperial household. The
Empress dowager alone chooses to live in
the old native style. It is said that the
Empress has decidedly pimple tastes both'
in matters of table and wardrobe.
Having no children around her one
would naturally thins that the Empress
would be lonely; yet she has a great deal
to occupy her mind. She has her duties
toward the ladies of the house, the least
of whom does not escape her gracious at
tention. The strict decorum of the court,
however, exclude all but those of noble
birth from being her near attendants.
She has always expressed intense inter
est in all that concerns the nation, whether
it be a quesiion of the year's rice crop or
one of momentous diplomatic issue. She
therefore Keeps herself informed on all
important subjects. The Japanese pleni
potentiary, on the occasion of the recent
treaty ratifications at Chefoo, was given
a special audience after his return. He is
not the only person who has been taken
by surprise at the intelligent and sagacious
questionings of her Majesty.
Little need be said about her literary ac
complishments. Everybody knows that
Her special talent lies in the domain of
national literature. One of her poems
has been set to music and is sung by
school children all over the land. Critics
are agreed on the fact that her style is de
cidedly classical. Very recently a beauti
tiful composition in the form of a diary
was made public, which is interesting not
only in point of literary value, but also on
account of the noble sentiments it ex
presses.
Her Majesty has always assiduously
patronized woman's education, and there
has been no better incentive to ambitious
girls all over the empire than her visits to
the Woman's High Normal School of
Tokio.
Everybody is so familiar with the numer
ous deeds of charity by means of which
her Majesty has set an example to the
women of the empire that only a slight
mention is necessary.
Her liberality toward the poor and dis
tressed is unbounded, whether manifest in
the form of money given to the sufferers
from fire and earthquake, of floss-silk sent
to the freezing soldiers in North China, or
in the siiape of bandages of her own roll
ing, and the substitutes for amputated
limbs given to native veterans and Chinese
captives. â The Chautauquan.
CATLIN'S LETTERS FOUND.
The Explorer's Theory Concerning the
Tribe of Indians Called Man inns.
Among the old documents of the Smith
sonian Institution a number of letters of
George C&tlin, the Western explorer,
writer, painter and naturalist, were dis
covered lately. They bring out certain
facts connected with his explorations on
the Missouri and Mississippi rivers in the
first part of fhe century, and they furnish
evidence that the tribe of Indians called
the Mandans, now extinct, were lineal
descendants of the followers of Madoc.
Madoc was the leader of the Welsh colony
whicn is thought to have landed on the
shores of this country in the fourteenth
century. The ancestors of these Indians
are supposed to have moved up from the
mouth of the Mississippi, where they had
landed, and to have been pushed far up
the Missouri by attacks of enemies until
they were entirely destroyed, either by
disease or the incursions of other tribes.
Catlin descended the Missouri River
from the Mandan village to St. Louis â a
distance of 1800 miles â and examined its
shores with great care. By discovering
again and again the remains of the ancient
locations of the Mandans, he traced them
down to the mouth of tbe Ohio River.
From exactly similar remains noticed
in several places in the State of Ohio and
other Slates to the south, he arrived at tne
conclusion that these Indians, from some
cause, had made repeated removals, until
they arrived at their place of residence
at the time of their extinction on the Up
per Missouri. The ancient fortifications
of the Mandans inclosed a great many
acres and were built on the banks of rivers.
They had walls twenty or thirty feet in
height, with covered ways to the water,
and showed a knowledge of the science of
fortification apparently not a century be
hind that of the present day. It is not be
lieved that they could have been built by
any nation of savages in America and
they are considered to present proof of the
former existence of a people very far ad
vanced in civilization. .
In Catlin's words, written in the '30'e,
his belief in regard to the early colony of
Welshmen was stated as follows:
"Now I am inclined to believe that the
ten ships of Madoc, or a part of them at
least, entered the Mississippi River at the
Baliz and made their way up the Mississ
ippi, or that they landed somewhere on
the Florida coast, and that the brave ana
persevering colonists made their way
through the interior to a p'sition on the
Ohio River, where they cultivated their
nelds and established in one of the finest
countries on earth a flourishing colony, but
they were at length sÂ«t upon by the sav
ages, whom perhaps they piovokeu to
warfare, being trespassers on their hunt
ing grounds, and by whom in overpower
ing hordes they were besieged until it
was necessary to erect ttuse for
tifications for their defense, 'into which
thej r were at la-t driven by a confederacy
of tribes, and there neld till their am
munition and provisions gave out, and
they, in the end, have perished, except,
perhaps, that portion of them who might
have formed alliance by marriage with
tbe Indians and their offspring, who
would have been half-breeds, and, of
course, attached to the Indian pide, whose
lives have been spared in tbe general mas
sacre, and at length, being despised, as all
half-breeds of enemies are, have gathered
themsolvesjjnto a band, and, severing
from their parent tribe, have moved on
and increased in numbers and strength as
they have advanced up the Missouri
River to the place where they have been
known for many hears by the name of
Mandans â a corruption or abbreviation of
Mudugwwys, the name applied by the
Welsh to the followers of MaU'awc." â St.
Louis Rtpublic.
DOLLY MADISON'S LIFE.
How thn I ittl<- On:krÂ»r I,i<vrrl the
World and lig Brightness.
Miss Beasion introduced her audience
yesterday afternoon in i er lecture at the
home of Mrs. Jacob Hess, 82 West Sixty
eiguth street, to a character very different
from the ones of which she has previously
told them, says tbe Mew York Tribune.
Her subject was "Dolly Madison," and
Dolly, though born a Quaker, loved the
world and the flesh and the devil, and
loved them all the more intensely because
of the Quaker grayness of her youth.
She was twice married â first to John
Todd, a Quaker lawyer, who died of yel
low fever, and then to James Madison.
At the time she met tbe latter she and
her mother were keeping boarders in
Philadelphia, and Aaron Burr was one of
the boarders. He introduced James Mad
ison to the family, and afterward took all
tbe credit for having made the match.
James Madison's visits to the fair widow
soon became so frequent that they at
tracted the attention ot Martha Wash
ington, a connection of tbe family, and
she wrote to Dolly in much the same
words that a modern matron might use
under similar circumstances.
"Dolly, come and see me at once."
she said. "I want to know what this
about James Madison means."
What it meant was >oon known to every
body, for Dolly was married to James
Madison with great eclat. She hud a real
wedding dress tni-; time, instead of Quaker
gray, with orange blossoms and jewels.
There were wedding favors on tbe horses,
the service was performed by a clergyman
of the English church, and afterward there
was a dance.
From that time on Dolly had all the
gayety she warned. She met dukes and
lords and princes, and was a brilliant
social success â all of wnich rejoiced her
frivolous little heart. An odd proof of her
utter and complete revolt ngaiim every
thing connected with Quakerism is to be
found in a miniature of her which has
been preserved, ar,d which shows her
decked out In no less than five distinct and
brilliant colors.
"DESERVED A GOOD BUSINESS"
The Parson's (iood Wishes for a Gener-
our Subscriber.
The debt of the struggling little church
in the suburbs had all been paid off but
|600, says the Chicago Tribune.
A clergyman noted for his skill and suc
cess in rat-ting church debts had been sent
for, and was conducting the morning ser
vice. The sermon was over and tbe work
of stirring up the audience to the requisite
pitch of enthusiasm had begun. Subscrip
tions rose rapidly to $300, then $400, and
after considerable effort to $500, where
they stuck. In vain the visiting brother
exhorted and pleaded. The limit of the
cash resources of the congregation ap
peared to have been reached, and at last
he sat down, discouraged.
Then Brother Plantus, a highly re
spected undertaker, who had made a lib
eral subscription already, rose and said:
"Brethren, this thing shan't fall through
after it has got as fa/ along as $500. I be
lieve in a man giving as tbe Lord has
prospered him, and, although I have
given a pretty good-sized donation, I am
ready to do more. I'll pay that last $lUO
myself. Here's my check for the amount."
â¢'I don't know your name, brother,"
shouted the visiting preacher, jumping to
his feet with enthusiasm," "but I hope
your business will double during tbe com
ing year, and I believe it will!"
One of the richest men in Mexico is a
German. Years ago he made a trip to the
fatherland, and while there took what
was supposed to be a worthless silver
mine for a bad debt. From this mine, El
Promontado, he now derives a yearly in
come of about Â£140,000.

Larkin Street Will Hold
a Grand Function
To- Night.
An Eiectric Celebration Worthy
of the Auspicious
Occasion.
Po k-Street Merchants Will Clasp
Hands and Bring the Western
Addition Into Prominence.
The Larkin-street Improvement Club
held a special meeting at Continental
Hall, 1017 Larkin street, last night to
make final arrangements for the grand
celebration to be held to-night in view of
the bridging of the chasm between the
older San Francisco and the new Western
Addition. President Dr. E. E. Hill pre
sided with all the dignity of an officer
cuosen to direct the deliberations of citi
zens who were determined to make their
preisence felt in the commercial world.
With President Hill were the officers of
the clubâ V:ce-President W. F. HairK
Secietary E. S. Jacobs and Treasurer W.
T. Kibblerâ with others composing the
member* of the various committees of the
grand celebration to take place to-night,
which will consist of music by the Letter
earners' band; red, biue.^reen and purple
lights furnished by the California Light
Company and Japanese lanterns, which
will be strung along the street from Sutter
street to McAllister in profusion.
Luke Battles of the Electric Light Com
pany, in order to show the residents how
they will look to-niirht when the fall cur
rent of electric power is transmitted into
arc rays, turned on the current before the
committee had expected such a boon.
The effect, however, was pleasing and
showed the people along the street what
a wonderful transformation light makes
in the appearance of a street that was
previously in a condition of semi-dark
ness.
Among the property-owners who re
sponded with princely liberality are: G.
L. Brasse of the firm of Brasse & Co., real
estate agents, 412 Pine street, who owns
considerable real estate on Larkin street;
and Judge W. T. Wallace, who has signi
fied his intention of assisting the good
work commenced. Mr. Brasse has already
responded in a manner worthy of a public*
spirited property-owner.
Major Robert Dross, secretary of the
.folk-street Improvement Club, was
present and invited the Larkin-street
Club members to join with his club on
Wednesday evening in carrying the
fiesta celebration along the line from
Polk street into Larkin.
This idea was accepted by Treasurer
Kibbler, who made a motion that a proper
committee be appointed to receive the
Polk-street fiesta committee an I extend
to them the courtesy of the club. This
motion was carried, and a joint celebra
tion of the two clubs will be had to-mor
row night.
Vice- President W. F. Harris spoke of the
benefits to be derived by the clubs joining,
as Polk and Larkin streets were identical
in their interests and a co-operation was
necessary to make a grand success of the
celebration.
H. a. Ha/ringer, chairman of the sub
scription committee, stated that he had
collected sufficient funds from the busi
ness men on Larkin street to give a erand
celebration.
F. W. Reicbers, a storekeeper on Eddy
and Larkin streets, advocated a liberal
and grand display. In this he was abiy
seconded by Reinhold Jentzsch, a saloon-
Keeper on O'Farrell and L<rkin streets.
Both men were in favor of keeping up the
celebration until the year 1897 dawns on
the people of this City."
Oscar Moses, chairman on lights, re
ported that the necessary funds had been
with few exceptions subscribed fo-. Tbe
Sutter-strÂ»et Railroad Company had con
ditionally promised to connect the current
between Polk and Larkin streets via Sut
ter before to-night, thus making one con
tinuous line of arc lights from Vallejo to
McAllister street.
NO SUITABLE LOCK-UP.
Berkeley v Ib Without an .. Adequate
Place* in Which to Lodge
' - Prisoners. . .<'.-.
BERKELEY, Cal,, Dec. 28.â Berkeley
is without a suitable building or even ! a
room lin which to ; lodge a prisoner over
night, and in consequence â¢ a movement
has \ been started at the North End by
private : citizens ;to build ~an â¢': adequate
lock-up for prisoners who should be cap
tured in that district Under the reigning
circumstances, every person who Is
arrested after dark has either to ba taken
six miles to Oakland, or, as Deputy Sheriff
Wood remarked to-night, be handcuffed
to a hitching- post. While there are two
jaiis in town, one at a West Berkeley rire
house and another back of the postoffice,
both have been declared by the officers
absolutely unlit for the purpose intended.
The single cell in East Berkeley is a mere
bole in the wall, lined with sheet-iron and
ventilated by a single look-out window,
and is without even a bench on which the
prisoner can rest. The one at the West
End is just as bad, if not worse. South
Berkeley, Lorin and the North End are
not even supplied with so much as a room
for captives.
Several of the officers have absolutely
refused to use either of the lock-ups, be
cause of their unhealthful and unstable
condition. If an arrest is made before
midnight the prisoner has to be taken to
the County Jail in Oakland. While doing
this the officer leaves his beat uncovered
for two hours. If a prisoner oe taken
after midnight his captor has either to
stay with him until the cars run in the
morning or cast him into one of the two
uncanny cells, and stand guaid lest he
should escape.
The lack of jail accommodations was
put before the Town Board some time ago,
but no action was taken by them. It is to
be brought up again in the near future.
Professor Bacon* Resignation.
BERKELEY, Cal., Dec. 28 âThe resig
nation of Professor Thomas R. Bacon
from tbe Philosophical Union at the State
University, whicn has been presented to
the executive board, has been the cause of
much comment in educational circles
within the last few days. The professor
gave as his reason for withdrawing that
he was dissatisfied with the representa
tions made by Professor Howison, presi
dent of the organization, as to the beliefs
of its members. The particular point at
issue is regarding the authenticity of
miracles.
Professor Howison, in his preface to a
book containing the discussions held be
fore the union during the la-t two years,
which is about to be published, conveys
the idea that the members of the Philo
sophical Union reject "miraclisni in every
form." This was too much for Professor
.Bacon, who is a retired minister of the
Congregational Church and ostensibly a
strong believer in miracles, end so he pre
sented his resignation. It has not been
acted upon as yet, ana from the present
outlook it would seem that a number of
other members, who hold to the sa me
belief with Professor Bacon will also with
draw their names.
Berkeley Brevities.
Petitions asking that a superintendent be
appointed to take charge of the construction
of the proposed new Dwight-way schoolhou*e

dent there is more in these Gaelic names
than Shakespeare dreamed of.
CONGRESS AND CUBA
The statements of Senator Chandler,
published in The Call yesterday, render
it evident that some of the leading men in
Congress intend to make use ot the Cuban
question to brine to a final settlement the
long discussion as to the relative powers
of Congress and of the President in deal
ing with foreign affairs. This will raise a
great constitutional issue and the contro
versy will have an important bearing on
the development of our own Government
as well as on the affairs of the Cubans.
Senator Chandler called attention to the
clause of the constitution which provides
that Congress shall have power "to make
all laws which shall be necessary and
proper for carrying into execution the
foregoing powers and all other powers
vested by this constitution in the Govern
ment of the United States or in any de
partment or office thereof." Under this
general authority it is claimed by Senator
Chandler that Congress can by law direct
the President in his action in nil dealings
with foreign nations. The Senator says:
The President may command the army and
navy. Yes; bnt Congress by law may give
him specific directions what to do with them,
to use them in any particular direction or not
to use them at all. He may make treaties
with the consent of the Senate and they be
come laws. Here is the only power to make
law not vested in Congress. He is to receive
the foreign Ministers. Yes; but only Min
isters from countries which Congress chooses
to have recognized. If two governments are
striving lor control of a country Congress may
by law decide which government the United
States will recognize and the President is
bound to obey the law and receive a Minister
from that government and refuse to receive a
Minister from the other.
The issue, it will be seen, raises an in
teresting point in constitutional law, and
aside from any effect it may have upon
Cuba is of importance to this country.
The debate upon it will engage the ablest
minds both in the Senate and in the
House, aud may determine once and for
all whether the President is to have vir
tually an exclusive control over foreign
affairs, or whether Congress can dictate
the policy to be pursued with foreign na
tions as well as that concerning affairs at
home.
It would be below the dignity of the
issue to consider Mr. Cleveland's person
ality in connection with it. He is but an
accident to the situation. In a few months
he will go out of office, never to return.
He is a factor in the problem only be
cause ha has acted in such a way as to
compel Congress to consider the problem
as one of practical politics. The decision
made will survive Mr. Cleveland's term
of office, and will determine the course of
the Government for all future time. It is,
therefore, an issue which should be de
bated on the broadest grounds of states
manship, and fortunately the leaders in
both houses of Congress are men who can
be relied upon to discuss it on that basis.
REGISTRATION OP PLANTS.
Congress is to be asked this winter to
establish a new bureau under the Agri
cultural Department for the purpose of
providing a thorough and complete regis
tration of plants in this country. The ob
iect of the bureau will be to furnish an
official register of all plants placed npon
the market, with a complete description
and specimens of the bloom, seed, foliage
and fruit.
The ends sought to be accomplished by
the advocates of the new bureau are lo
prevent the duplication of names, to
bring about the renaming of many sorts
of plants of commercial use, the simplifi
cation of nomenclature, the formation of
a National herbarium of economic plants
and an exhibitfon of varieties as well as
the variation of plants under culture. By
effecting these objects it is believed the
new bureau will enable the propagator of
new plants to obtain some roward for his
labor in the same manner as is now
accorded to the inventor of an improve
ment in machinery.
It is expected that all plant breeders
and growers will indorse the efforts of the
promoters of the plan and that the move
ment for the establishment of the bureau
will have a strong support in Congress.
It is certainly advisable that a work of
this kind should be undertaken by the
Government. The United States is the
greatest producer of Uheful plants in the
world, and large sums of money are in
vested in enterprises to propagate new
and better varieties of all kinds of trees
and shrubs. Those who devote their time
and energies to this work deserve recogni
tion from the Government and are en
titled to protection by law which will
secure to them the benefits of their in
dustry and skill.
The proposed bureau would be of great
benefit to the people of California*. The
industry of plant life in this State, al
though carried to an extraordinary ex
tent, is as yet in its infancy. It is scarcely
possible to set limits to the increase in
this State of varieties of all kinds of vines,
shrubs and trees, which are either useful,
beautiful or medicinal. It is not too much
to expect that in California the vegetable
world will yet receive its fullest and high
est development miner the careful culture
of scientific horticulturists. It will be
profitable to us, therefore, to have a gov
ernment supervision which will enable
our producers to receive due credit and
profit. The California delegation in
Congress can surely b9 counted on to as
sist the movement, and should be urged
to do so by all who are interested in our
horticultural industries.
BIMETALLISM ADVANCES.
The speech of M. Meline, Prime Min
ister of France, in the Chamber of Depu
ties some days ago, in which he declared
that the welfare of agricultural industry
depends upon a return to bimetallism, has
given rise to considerable discussion in
the Eastern States, and as a result fuller
information has been brought out con
cerning the subject than was given in the
first dispatches.
Among those who have been interviewed
on tbe question is M. Edmond Bruwaert,
Consul-General of France at New York
City, who, while declining to discuss the
issue aB a political one, pointed out that
M. Meiine, before he became Prime Min
ister, had presented a bill to tbe Chamber
of Deputies calling for a governmental
inquiry to be made in regard to the pos
sibilities ofinternational bimetallism and
its probable result it adopted by the lead
ing nations of the world.
M. Bruwaert went on to say that an ag
ricultural association has been formed in
France which advocates the adoption of
tbe bimetallic standard. This organiza
tion has a large membership and is allied
with similar associations in Germany and
Great Britain. Th& associations have
been powerful enough in the past to ob
tain the presentation of bills before their
respective Parliaments fora return to bi
metallism, and with each new discussion
of the subject have grown in numbers and
in strengtu.
As M. Meline, so long identified with
the bimetallic movement, has now become
Prime Minister of France, the prospects of
bimetallism in that country are brighter
than ever before and the fact that the
Prime Minister of the French republic is
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 29, 1896.
a strong biinetallist has added also to the
prestige of bimetallic associations else
where. The outlook for some sort of in
ternational agreement is therefore better
in Europe than it has been at any time in
the past, and it is probable that some so*
lution to this long-vexed problem is at
hand.
There can be no question that the move
ment in Europe toward bimetallism has
been largely promoted by the success of
the Republican party in the recent elec
tions in this country. It is well under
stood by the leading financiers on the
other side of the ocean that McKinley was
elected President on a platform pledging
him to promote the free coinage of silver
by international agreement. The action
of the Republicans of tne Senate in ap
pointing a committee to devise legislation
looking toward some means of bringing
about such agreement shows that the
party intends to keep that pledge to the
letter. The influence of the United States
wiiJ therefore be added to that of France
in advancing the movement, and thus all
genuine bimetallists have abundant en
couragement in the prosecution of the
work.
With such prospects before us it seems
clear that Bryan's attempt to continue the
free silver crusade will be labor in vain,
lew Americans will care to endanger the
chauce of international bimetallism by
giving support to a further agitation for
silver monometallism in this country. If
all sincere friends of silver will act now
with the McKinley administration there
seems assurance we shall successfully
solve this problem before the next Presi
dential election.
THE ORIENTAL TRADE
San Francisco's opportunity to become
the metropolis of the vast trade of the
coa3ts that circle the Pacific Ocean, as well
as the methods by which to lay hold of
it, are pointed out in a long, urgent letter
recently received by the Chamber of Com
merce from John Barret, United States
Minister to Siam. Mr. Barret writes not
from a superficial investigation, but after
mature study of the situation. He has
been over the ground several times and
has collected and re-collected statistics and
all kinds of data bearing on the subiect.
The opinion is emphatically expressed
thnt San Francisco should be the control
ling port of the entire Pacific seas, second
to none in Asia, Australia or South Amer
ica. The circle of trade comprehended in
this vast field represents a population of
500,000,000 and $1,000,000,000 of annual
business. Immense as this commerce is
now it is but in its infancy and is certain
to haveÂ«an immense expansion.
Mr. Barret calls attention to the dimen
sions of the traffic already carried on ; to
hundreds of coasting steamers, to the
dozen or more great steamship companies
running steamers from Europe to the
East, to the organization of British and
German business in the form of great
exporting and importing homes in every
important city in the Orient, and to the
commercial commissions sent out by Eu
ropean chambers of commerce to investi
gate every detail of demand and supply in
the trade.
He singles ont Shanghai as the fore
most of all the great marts across the
Pacific, and advises the establishment of
the closest possible commercial relations
with that city. He recommends that San
Francisco should use its influence to estab
lish an American chamber of commerce
at Shanghai, which could act as a potent
factor in assisting trade exchange. In
connection with this chamber he points
out there could be arranged a permanent
exhibition of American products to make
the Chinese familiar with American ex
port goods, as well as to furnish American
exporters all kinds of information about
the needs of the Chinese markets.
It is further recommended that a San
Francisco bank, with ageacies in London
and New York, should establish a leading
branch in Shanghai, with lesser ones at
other places. Capable agents should be
sent to the far East to thoroughly study it,
and an American steamship company, or a
strongly capitalized American house act
ing as agent therefor, should have vessels
of lighter draught than those crossing the
Pacific, which connecting with trans-
Pacific lines would carry the trade of- the
smaller Oriental port?. The establish
ment of something in this City which
might he called an Orientrfl Exchange i 3
suggested, where could be exhibited sam
ples of all kinds of merchandise imported
from Eastern Asia, with data as to prices
and consumption.
In regard to what the Nation should do
in this connection, Mr. Barret testifies, as
the result of his study of the commerce of
the world, to the necessity of Government
subsidies to foster the building up of a
proper merchant marine to make sure our
commercial prosperity ; just as the great
commercial nations of England, France

This communication from Mr. Barret
should set the merchants of the City to
work to carry out that part of the pro

creation of a great merchant marine that
would make Oid Glory a familiar sight in
all the world's great ports. These things
united with the needed reforms in lessen

so frequent and so richly freighted as to

prosperity which will secure to her the
proud position of the metropolis of the

AROUND THE CORRIDORS
T. 8. Minott, an attorney of Marshfleld, Or.,
is at the Lick, on his way to the new gold fields
at KandsDurg.
The country about Marshfleld, which Is on
Coos Bay, is known as one of the best in the
United States for big game. Tuere is elk there
in considerable numbers.
''There are three bands about there," said
Mr. Minott. "One consists of about twenty
five elk, and these range between the Elk
River and Iron Mountain ana the Six Rivers.
Another band of about twenty range between
the North Slough and the Umpqua, or Ten
mile Lake. Besides these there is a band of
fifteen or more between the headwaters of the
Coquelie and Coos rivers.
"The elk breed reasonably fast. They have
just about held their own for several years,
notwithstanding the Inroads of the hunters.
The elk grow very tame during a part of the
season.
"A band came down to tidewater and visited
Lev! Bmith's place in September last, during
the fishing season. Tne men there killed two
with shotguns. The elk roam over an area
about 150 miles in extent.
"The best hunting is on Elk River. If a man
from here wants to take a flyer at it, he wants
to land at Port Orford, and then take a pack
mule and go up to the head of Elk River.
"The Iron Mountain country is covered with
oaks and cllnkerpins. CUnkerpins are pecu
liar shrubs that grow there. Besides these
there is plenty of sala brush. Bear are fat and
thick in there. About every tenth oak you
strike will have a bear in it, aud all about there
are bear in plenty.
"It Is a marvelous game country. I know
no better anywhere. The last thing I killed
was a bear. I have not hunted for any elk for
a good while. Anybody can kill a deer there,
there are so many."

A MUSICAL BURLESQUE
If you want to write a must cal burlesque
The recipes you never must ignore:
You needn't be amusing or grotesque:
Per comra; you should never fail to bore.
Yon needn't care a Jot for the nature of the plot-
Coherency may run the booking dry:
Bnt you certainly will fall If yonr idiotic tale
Doesn't bear a negro luliaby.
You must make a naughty reference now and
then
To the funny little things they do in France,
And, if failing to express It with our pen.
You can illustrate our meaning with a dance.
While no matter what your story, you must mouth
about tbe glory
Of the soldier or the sailor far away:
Like a stripling of a Kipling, or like Tommy when
he's tipplingâ
Yon are bound to write a patriotic lay.
Then you Introduce a broker or a Jew:
A soldier must be pitted with a snob;
And the idiotic heroine must woo
In a song that is supposed 10 make you sob.
If you start act lat home, in the second you must
roam
To the Continent, to India, or Japan;
And of late the dolly ditty is considered rather
pretty,
For it's well to be domesticâ when yon can.
You needn't be particular with rhymes,
"Mamma" and "far" are jingled by the throng;
While -love" and "move"â how many, many
times?â
Are coupled in the sentimental scng.
A lavish lot of frocks (that display tbe wearer's
docks)
Must never, never possltlr be missed;
While your prospect will be bright if the risky
opening night
Sees your "comedy" most vigorously hissed.
âThe Sketch.
DAINTY NIGHT GOWN OR LOUNG
ING ROBE.
The charming gown shown here shows the
Impress of the Empire style. It is a model
used both for lounging robes and night dresses.
For the latter it may be made of a variety of
fabrics, from muslin or flannelette to china
silk. In the latter material it is shown for
trousseaux trimmed with butter-colored or
white lace; ribbons of bright but delicate
tones are run through the lace, which con
fines the front below the bust.
A very dainty gown in nainsook had trim
mings of nnrrow yellow Valenciennes lace.with
bands of fine Hamburg embroidery.
Colored lawns and batistes with white em
broidery or lace â either white or yellow â are
very dainty. The batistes especially will be
found quite satisfactory, for they launder
beautifully.
A lounging robe of twiUed French flannel of
a medium pink is dainty with trimmings of
white lace with blue ribbons run under. A
violet and white checked flannel with white
lpce and violet ribbons is another pretty com
bination. ,
A gown of pink and green striped wool had
the square yoke top of green satin ribbon,
with frills of pink chiffon.
One of the daintiest creatlonsin the way ol a
lounging robe was seen in an elaborate trous
seaux, it was of white flannel, the square
yoke being of white satin ribbon with a border
ol sable on either edge. At the outer edge a
frill of white chiffon hung. The belt was of
white ribbon. â¢
SMALL VOTE FOR SOUTHERN EL
ECTORS.
New York Bnn.
The official returns of the vote of Nebraska
at the late election show the aggregate poll to
have been 223,091. The vote of South Caro
lina, as given by the Augusta Chronicle, was
68,431 only, and of Mississippi 69,403 |only.
Yet both of these Southern States have a
greater population than Nebraska, the present
estimates being 1,375,000 for South Carolina,
1,350,000 for Mississippi and only 1,160,000
for .Nebraska. Mississippi and South Carolina
have nine electoral votes each and Nebraska
only eight. As they were ah Bryan States we
put them together to show how easy it was for
a repudiation oligarchy to carry the two
Southern States and what a tussle Bryan had
in the Northwestern States.

HOW PASTORS
MAKE SERMONS
Congregationalists Throw
Light on Their
Methods.
Dr. Adams Studies and Rev.
Philip Coombs Has His Text
Always With Him.
Christian Pastors Listen to an Ex
tended Pan for Japanese
Evangel zatioa.
The pastors of the Congregational Mon
day Club spent their meeting yesterday
explaining to one another how they pre
pare their Sabbath sermons.
Rev. Dr. Adams of the First Congrega
tional Church said that he passes his fore
noons all the weok in his study, occupied
in filling his mind with appropriate sub
jects. He always divides his discourse
into three distinct heads; "but I take
care," he said, "that these heads do not
stand out like bare, uncovered ribs."
Key. Dr. Chapman explained that he
studies the people with whom he is
brought in contact daring the week and
selects his topic from the ideas that they
bring to his mind. Key. Philip Coombe
fixes on a text for his morning sermon
early in tbe week, and from that time
till Sunday comes he has it constantly in
bis mind. When he is attending to his
ministerial duties tho text is always with
him. He thinks of it by day and often
by night and gradually evolves the ser
mon from his thoughts and experiences.
Key. J. A. Crnzan believes in preaching
on topical subjects, and with this end in
view be keeps an immense indexed scrap
book. When he wants an idea for a ser
mon Mr. Cruzan finds more than a
wealth of matter in bis scrapbook, which
is largely made up of newspaper clip
pings.
Professor Lloyd selects a text and then
looks around ior illustrations. No impos
sibly good little boys and girls will satisfy
the requirements of his sermon. He
studies the actual men and women with
whom be is brought into contact and
uses them to point a moral and adorn a
Sunday discourse.
Key. George Mooar said: "I consider
that a pastor should be always in a homo
letic frame of mind." By this, he ex
plained, be did not consider a pastor
should be always composing mental ser
mons, but he should be in tbe frame of
mind which would make him capable of
composing sermons if necessary.*
Rev. William C. Pond, D.D., considers
a sermon is a message. "Sometimes the
sermon makes tbe text and sometimes the
text makes the sermon," he said.
The Christian pastors, who are now
holding their Monday meetings at tbe
Young Men's Christian Association, were
addressed yesterday on "Japanese Work,"
by Rev. W. A. Coryea, who haa charge of
tbe Japanese mission recently opened in
connection with the First Christian
Church on Twelfth street. Mr. Coryea
said that me mission was not an individ
ual enterprise, but was one that should
interest all Christian pastors and congre
gations: "It is the first work of its kind
among our people in this country,'' he
said. Tbe objects of the mission were
explained to be the Christianizing of
Japanese, tbe establishment of a Japanese
church and the sending of educated
Japanese back to the Mikado's dominions
as heralds of tbe cross.
At the Methodist preachers' meeting.
Rev. F. D. Eoyard read a paper on "Phil
osophy and Miracles," in which he upheld
the historicity of miracles. Rev. G. W.
Beatty, Rev. W. 8. U rmy and Rev. G. H.
Jones, were appointed a committee to
nominate officers to be voted for at the
next meeting.
Rev. F. S. Brush of Alameda read a re
view at tbe Presbyterian Ministerial Asso
ciation on the Duke of Argyll's latest
work, "The Philosophy of Belief." The
general opinion, both of the speaker and
ministers who took part in the discussion,
was that the Duke of Argyll had done good
by insisting on God as a God of law as
well as of love.
An adjourned meeting of the San Fran
cisco Presbytery was neld yesterday, at
which it was unanimously resolved to eive
H. F. Marshall letters of transfer to Mor
rison Presbytery, Orange County, N. J.
Rev. Dr. Hem ph ill and Rev. Dr. Scott, who
had been appointed a commission to pre
pare a frnternal prasbytery letter of trans
fer for Rev. J. Camming Smith, sub
mitted a letter to the Indianapolis Pres
bytery speaking in the highest terms of
the reverend gentleman. The letter was
unanimously adopted. Rev. C. C. Her
riott's fetter from Minneapolis Presbytery
was accepted.
The secretary of the Home Missionary
Society asked whether the presbytery
would authorize the payment of $300
asked by the congregation of Lebanon
Church, for Rev. Donald Ross. The re
quest was put to the ballot and was car
ried.
GOVERNMENT OWNERSHIP.
An Appeal for Something More Than
a Mere Defeat of the Fund
ins; Bill.
The following communication has been
received by Mayor Sutro as chairman of the
committee of fifty, calling for united action
in the interest of not only a defeat of the
funding bill, bat for the Government own
ership of tbe Central Pacific:
San Francisco, Dec. 28, 1896.
â¢â¢ To the Committee of Fifty, Hon. Ado'ph Sutro
Chairman, San Francisco, Val.â Gentle m en: The
undersigned very respectfully urge the adop
tion of a policy upon your part looking toward
the acquisition and operation of the Central '
Pacific Railroad by the Government of ; the
United States.
We urge this upon the well-known basis that
the people ot this State have expressed their
views emphatically and decisively in favor oi
that proposition. We maintain that you, act-
Ing for the people of California,; are in honor
bound to use your utmost efforts in the direc
tion which their expressed will has dictated
Moreover, at this time, when Senator Mor
gan and other prominent public officers have
taken up our cause and have declared for Gov
ernment ownership, It is especially demanded
by the exigencies of the controversy that
united action should be secured. It is no
longer excusable for a representative body ot
Caufornians to show weakness in fighting for
what the people want when others from out
side our borders have shown a willingness to
secure for us the full measure of our rights in
this matter of the Pacific railroads
x We beg to remind you that no petitions have
been signed and no mass-meetings held in this
?ht^Â£ 2f : aVe - Bi Â« nifled Â» willingness upon
the part of the people to accept my Po
sition designed to place i he ownership of these
roads in the hands of other private capitalists J
who are quite as objectionably as C V. Hunt

or any other representatives of foreign .yndii
cates, are regarded with just as much distrust

tnÂ£d or .Shl?. Â° Ur eÃ ' lmati0 Â°' ior consti
l"'â¢.or, chosen spokesmen of the people to
represent to Con 8 Â« that we will be satisfied
rn^h a ,. Cliang3 0I ownership from Huntington
ana his associates to Gould or Vauderbilt and
other objectionable characters. uuerDm * na
it is a well-known fact that with very few ex
ceptions the civilized nations of the world do
? n m^ii m iK the V s railroads 'to, be owned and
controlled by private capitalists. It is the ex
perience > of our Nation that the Government
has i always been : able to operate the "enter.
Faitkfn^thÂ» S r. TH Umed with n > ore general satis:
faction than the same enterprises gave under
private ownership. The people of no city.
State or nation ever sanction the return to the
private ownership system in regard to any
function which has once been operated by v
themselve* through their public servants. This \
fact proves conclusively how great a value is im
placed upon the principle of public ownership W
by the masses.
In view of these incontrovertible argument!
we trust you will realize that with a keen
sense of honor and duty and with a bold sir.nd
for the people's rights and welfare, more good
car be accomplished and more respect won
from friends and loes than can be gained by
seeking to punish Mr. Huntington for his mis
deeds.
We believe that we voice the sentiment of
this commonwealth when we ask you to fight
for Government ownership of the Pacific rail
roads and to uphold Senator Morgan and
others in their efforts in that direction. We
consider it an empty victory if the funding
bill should be defeated and no permanent or
genuine beneficial solution of the transconti
nental railroad question attained.
We request a careful consideration of this
appeal and hope your acceptance of the ideas
herein contained will lead to the common
good of this State. Yours very respectfully,

TO SUCCEED MRS. COOPER
No One Yet Suggested as Presi
dent of the Kindergarten
Association.
The Matter May Be Acted Upon at
the Next Meeting of the Board
on January 14
Since tbe tad death of Mrs. Sarah B.
Cooper, the affairs of the Golden Gate f
Kindergarten Association, of which she
was the head, has been tinder the control
of the board of directors.
"Mrs. Louis Sloss," said Mrs. Minna
V. Gaden, the secretary, "who is our sec
ond vice-president, has been filling the
office of president and will continue to do
so until the vacancy is filled, bnt by whom
has not yet been even suggested, for it will
be extremely difficult to tind one pos
sessed of all the qualifications that our
dear friend, Mrs. Cooper, possessed. The
board will hold its first business meeting
since the double tragedy on the 14th of
next January and the vacancy may and it
may not be filled, but it is possible that
some one's name will be suggested. Until
then every tiling will move along as it does
now.
"It was suggested that the executive
committee should commemorate the mem
ory of Mrs. Cooper and her daughter by a
memorial service, but the idea, in view of
the many tributes that have been paiu,
was abandoned.
"The board, however, adopted the fol
lowing:
Inasmuch as the All-wise Controller of hu
man events has permitted the removal by
sudden death of Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper and her
beloved daughter, Harriet, to a higher sphere
of existence we, the members of the Golden
Gale Kindergarten Association, siucerely
mingling our sorrow with tnat of the whole
community for the great loss which has thus
fallen upon us, desire to continue as the nio^t
appropriate memorial both the kindergar
tens in whose conduct they took such promi
nent and important part; therefore,
Resolved, Thaj the Dresent executive board
arrange in the near future such plans as may
be conducive to this end.
Resolved, That tne noble work of rescuing
the little children of this City from unfortu
nate environments and often vicious in
fluences at an age when they mos:
need uplifting, the years for character
building, which work was rooted in
Mrs. Cooper's Bible-class, with no apparent
financial resources, and which has been provi
dentially fostered by the assistance of gener
ous friends and the work (under aboard of
managers; of trained aud energetic teachers,
be carried to its ultimate, trusting that the
seme active lntetest and financial support
will be Â»o efficient that the kindergartens
themselves will become a living testimony to
the worth of this distinguished and honored
founder and a sweet memory of those who,
united in their lives, were undivided in death.
It is probable that a memorial report, to
be included in the next annual report, will
be prepared.
A Pantor'a Daughter Engaged.

Adamsâ Trouble in the
Fairway.
The United States steamer Adams got
in from Honolulu last nignt minus about
forty-eight of her crew and one quarter
master. The sailors were all enlisted in
San Francisco prior to the sailing of the
warship ten months ago, and their desti
nation had barely been reacned before the
men began deserting and heading back for
San Francisco. Nearly all of them were
back here months ago and the vessel had
to return snort handed.
William Clancy was the quartermaster
in question. Just before the Adams sailed
he went into the armory and shot himself
through the right lung. Clancy was in
love with a young Hawaiian belle, anS
when he heard that the vessel was ordered
back to San Francisco, and it dawned on
him that he would have to leave his in
amorata, he nearly went crazy. He went
ashore and got drunk, but waa brought
back aboard by his comrades. Just before
the anchor was hove up the young lady in
question pulled out to the Adams in a
boat. When Clancy saw her he tried to
jump overboard but was restrained. Then
he rushed below and into the armory,
where he committed the rash deed. He
was attended by the ship's doctor and
later was moved to the Alert. The last
report brought by the Australia was to the
effect that he was slowly improving,
Clancy is 26 years of age and is highly
spoken of by the officers.

RAN OFF WITH A
BAG OF GOLD
A Tramp's Daring Robbery
in a Merchant's
Office.
He Coolly Takes $425 From the
Counter and Effectually
Disappears.
The Deed Commitlei While a Stenog
rapher's Back Was Turned to
the Robber.
One of the coolest and most successful
robberies of the year was committed yes
terday afternoon on Battery street under
the eyes of many business men, and the
robber escaped without leaving a solitary
clew to his hiding place.
It was all over In the twinkling of an
eye; a sack of gold was gone, and that
was the end of the daring act.
The victim is the Harry Unna Com
pany, wooden and willow ware merchants
at 113 Battery, which regrets the
loss of $425 in gold that was taken
from its office in the presence of clerks,
typewriters, salesmen and the proprietors
themselves. The thief was to all appear
ances a tramp seeking alms, but now that
he showed such cunning, coupled with
daring and apparently professional skill,
in helping himself to other people's prop
erty, the members of the Unna company
are convinced that a "crook" ran afoul of
their establishment.
The hour when the crime was commit
ted was close to 3 p. m., when the banks
close. Harry Unna, president of the com
pany, had counted out $425 lor deposit in
the Anglo-Californian Bank and had put
the money into a cunvas bag. He placed
the little sack of gold upon the office
counter beside the bankbook and went
outside to talk with a retail dealer, then
purchasing goods. The coin was all pre
pared for Sam Heyman, the secretary, to
take to the bank, but Mr. Heyman was en
gaged wit j another customer, and for that
reason delayed depositing it until the last
minute.
Meanwhile the tramp entered the office
and asked for a meal ticket. He stood at
the counter evidently oblivious of the bag
of gold, and the typewriter went to the
rear office to get a ticket.
This was the poor man's chance to make
a division of riches, and right well did the
tramp rise to the occasion. While the
young lady's back was turned the gentle
man of rest resolved promptly not to wait
for a Salvation Army meal ticket. His
hand reached for that tempting bag with
the gold double eagles showing through
the cloth, and he walked out without say
ing "Good-day." He passed Mr. Unna
and actually brushed atrainst Mr. Hey
man as be sanntered toward the door with
the gold under his coat.
W hat happened him. whether he walked,
ran or called a hack, is equally doubtiul,
although at all events his actions did not
arouse suspicion, for nobody could be
found who noticed an excited tramp in the
wholesale district. The up-to-date son of
rest contented himself with vanishing.
Immediately afterward the police were
notified and a search was begun. The
ferry depots were blockaded and besides
detectives were detailed to patrol the
water front to look out for the robber, who
possibly might try to escape on some ship
leaving port. Another watch was put on
tlie Third and Townsend streets depot
and policemen on the street were given a
description of the fellow.
All that Harry Dnna and his partner
could do was to say things about them
selves for having had anything to do with
men who begged meal tickets. The two
merchants came to the conclusion without
the assistance of argument, that they
were mistaken in the philanthropy, and
declared they would never more distribute
meal tickets to help either the worthy or
unworthy.
"It was this way," said Mr. Heyman.
"We have given men a chance to earn a
meal and bed, and in that way shut off
tha professional beggars who swarm about
this part of the City. Whenever a tramp
came in here looking for something, we
said : 'Go downstairs and work for an hour
in the cellar, and thin we will give you a
ticket to the Salvation Army shelter for a
meal and a bed.'
"The tramps would be put at cleaning
np the basement or breaking old boxes.
This afternoon one of them, a young man,
applied for assistance, and he was given
work in the cellar. It was about a quarter
of three when he came to the office for his
ticket. I was just outside the office door,
and my partner, Mr. Unna, was a few
yards off, waiting on customers. The
money lor deposit was made up. $425 in
gold, and put upon the counter for me to
take round to the bank. All we know
about it now, is that tho tramp got out
while the typewriter went to get him a
ticket, and when we looked for the money
it was gone. That tramp passed by me
going out, and the place was quite full of
people, but he worked it so well nobody
saw him take the coin.
"We got a good description of him and
our cellermen say they can positively
identify him. The matter is now in the
hands of the police, but it is doubtful if
the money can be recovered. Anyhow
this has taught us a lesson, and it is the
last time that a tramp can ever get a meal
ticket in this house."
The cellermen described the tramp as a
man of medium heignt and, build and
about 35 years of age. His face was dis
tinctly Scandinavian, hair very fair and
cut very short, and he had a thin, blonde
mustache. His clothes were of dark ma-

terial and not so shabby as the standard
of his class. He wore a white shirt and
turned-down blue collar. The one dis
tinguishing mark was a scar or something
like it on his right cheek, close under the
eye.
"When he came downstairs," said the
foreman in that department, "I did not
take him to be a man looking for work,
because he was pretty well dressed and
did not act or look like a regular tramp.
He wanted to inspect everything, and in
stead of working where he was put came
out to look about the place, so that I grew
suspicious of him. I could easily identify
him again, an he had a red spot on the top
of his nose and a scar on his cheek. He
had taken some liquor before he came
here, and appeared to be ready for any
kind of a job."
Up to a late hour la?t night no trace of
the thief was got by the police.

MURDERED BY
CHINESE THUGS
A Man Stabbsd in the Neck
and Hanged to a
Rafter.
The Murderers Burned Their
Victim's Clothing and
Bedding.
A Shocking Tragedy on Saturday
Night Not Discovered Until Late
Yesterday Afternoon.
A shocking murder was discovered in
the Chinese quarter yesterday afternoon.
A young Chinaman had been stabbed to
death and then hanged to the rafter in a
vacant stable in order to give color to the
idea that he had committed suicide.
The crime was evidently committed in
a small cottage at 808 Stockton street, next
door to the Chinese consulate. As nearly
as can be learned the victim, whose name
is not positively known, was butchered
about 3 o'clock on Sunday morning. The
story of the surrounding circumstances,
as learned from H. D. Stewart, shows the
crime to be one of the most atrocious ou
record for years.
Mr.Stewart is a watchman in that neigh
borhood, and he resides at 716 Stockton
street. Early Sunday morning.while pass
ing along his district, he was toid that
there had been a tight in 808 Stockton
street, about 3 o'clock. Loud voices were
heard accompanied by the sounds of a
struggle, and cries of distress followed by
groans. Mr. Stewart went by the place,
but all was quiet.
The house is probably one of the fir3t
built in that part of the City, it is a little
old-fashioned cottage now badly rotted
with age and not fit for habitation. In
the front room a Chinese doctor whose
name is said to be Wong Bo L>ung had his
office, consisting of a few shelves covered
with herbs, a pestle, mortar and scales.
There was but little furniture in the apart
ment. Dr. Wong Bo Lung srept in his
store. In the rear are three small rooms
used by half a dozen Chinese and the
murdered man, whose name is said to be
Loo Ho/, was one of the occupants. The
names of the others could not be learned.
As stated, there were no signs of trouble
when Mr. Stewart went past the house,
and the matter escaped his memory until
about 6 o'clock Sunday morning when
upon passing the house he noticed a lot of
bedding and clothing burning on the side
walk. There lay a spring and hair mat
tress, blankets and a quantity of clothing
such as would compose a Chinaman's
wardrobe. He asked if there had been a
fire in the cottage and was told that there
bad, but that no alarm had been sounded
as those who lived there had extinguished
the blaze and dragged the smoldering
bedding and clothes to the sidewalk. The
rain soon after put out the fire in the
bedding and nothing more was thought of
the incident. At that time, however, the
Chinese doctor and several of the lodgers
were in the store and there was nothing
suspicious in their actions.
Later in the day Mr. Stewart was told
that there had been serious trouble in the
house an hour or so after midnight. His
informant was a Chinaman. He went
back to the place, but all appeared to be
straight and he went away, believing that
there had been nothing worse than a
drunken brawl. Yesterday he was again
told of the commission of a crime in the
little old cottage.
This made him think that possibly it
was a case for the police to look into, and
he called for the services of Officer J. W.
Caples. When the two went to the prem
ises to their surprise they found that they
were vacant. ThÂ« lodgers had gathered
their effects and fled. Even the doctor
had skipped and the store was in the
greatest disorder. Everything indicated
that the flight of all had been hasty and
that it had been made some time during
Sunday night. Boxes were overturned
and the crude iurniture was scattered in
confusion.
After a long search in the trash that lit
ered the floor the officer found in the
room, later learned to be tbat of the dead
man, several small blood stains. There
was also cv dence of a lire in the room.
Finally, in thorough basement the search
ers found a blood-stained handkerchief,
and the stains were apparently fresh.
Looking through the cracks of the
basement walls the officer saw a
small yard and alleyway in the rear
of the premises, and beyond was a stable
that had been vacant for over five years.
The front entrance to the stabje was
closed, the gate being nailed. By the aid
of a ladder Mr. Stewart and the officer got
into the yard from the rear of the cottage
and the first thing they observed was that
the soft ground bad been disturbed, as
though by a heavy body falling upon it.
Then followed an inspection of the sta
ble. Like the cottage it was small and
old. The upper story had been used for
hay and the lower part a? a wagon-room.
The two parts are connected by a step
ladder tbat goes through a little square
hole in ths floor above. As soon as the
searchers' eyea became accustomed to the
reduced light a ghastly sight was pre
sented.
Hanging by a rope attached to one of
the rafters directly over the front of the
stepladder was the cold, stiff body of .a
Chinaman. The face, hands and clothing
were besmeared with dried blood. A closer
inspection showed that the blood had
come from a wound in the neck under the
right ear. His queue had bsen wound
around the throat as though to hide the
wound.
The first glance was sufficient to show
that a terriole murder haa been commit
ted and the body placed in this position
to give the appearance of suicide, but the
effort was crude. At any rate the murder
ers were successful in hiding the remains
until they could escape. By the aid of a
candle the officer found several spots and
pools of blood leading to a smaller en
irance on the south end of the building,
which is opposite tde place where the
body must have been thrown or lowered
from the house on Stockton street.
The Coroner was notified and the body
cut down. Three pieces of rope, leather
strap and silk sash had been spliced to
gether to hang the body to the rafter. It
was very evident that the murderers were
obliged to carry the body well up the lad
der to fasten it to the sash. All efforts to
secure information from the Chinese in
the neighborhood were of but little avail.
They disclaimed all knowledge of the
people or of the affair. Even the store
keeper next door pretended to be igno
rant concerning the tragedy.
Late yesterday one Chinaman was found
who said that the viciim's name was Loo
Hor, and that he was a member of the
Sam Yup society. He further stated that
the doctor's nama was Wong Bo Lung,
and that he was a See Yup man. All the
other lodgers, he added, were See Y'up
men. Ii was considered by the police re
markable, if true, that a Sam Yup man
should live with See Yups when those so
cieties have such n dislike and hatred for
each other. The police will endeavor to
tun down the murderers, but this will
prove difficult, as the guilty men have had
plenty of chance to get far from the City
by this time.
The Chinese consulate was guarded
by a special, detail of officers last nieht
in order that a possible attempt to as
sassinate the Consul and his assist
ants could be promptly frustrated.
THE REVOLVER AGAIN.
Jue Gin* tha Victim of the Latest
Hlghbnder Killing.
A paean assassin's bullet thinned the
ranks of the Suey Sing Tong by one at
11:50 o'clock last night. Jue Ging, a
prominent member of that society and
paymaster of a Chinese Alaska fisheries
company, was shot down and instantly
killed by an unknown highDinder at the
corner of Jackson street and St. Louis
alley. There was but one witness, John
J. Simmons.
Unfortunately he did not watch the
murderer closely enough to be able to
identify him.
The murder was a most cold-blooded
and systematic one. According to Sim
mons Jue Ging turned into Jackson street
from Dupont and walked ieisurely along
toward St. Louis alley.
Just as he reached the corner of the two
streets a crowd of eight or ten Chinese
stopped on the opposite side of Jackson
street and one of the party pointed out
the paymaster.
Quick as a flash another Chinese drew a
large revolver from under his blouse and
handed it to another highbinder standing
nearer the curbstone.
The last man raised the weapoto and in
order to scatter any congregation of Mon
golians in the vicinity fired into the air.
He then lowered his weapon and fired at
Jue Ging.
The bullet hit its mark and the
man fell to his knees badly woundci. A
third shot was fired, which struck the
kneeling man fair in the b^ck and he
roiled over dead.
The three shots were all fired in an in
stant, and before those who heard the pis
tol reports could prevent the, highbinder
who had committed the murder had es
caped.
Sergeant Helms and five officers were
soon at the scene of the crime, but failed
to find a clew to the murderer.
liand of Hope Entertainment.
The little follcs of the Golden Gate Band of
Hope give their Christmas entertainment to
night at the First Baptist Church, on Eddy
street. They only charge a dime admission,
and as they always make some good and char
itable use oi all the money they receive as the
result of their entertainments it is to be hoped
that a large attendance will greet the juvenile
actors and elocutionists. The proceeds of
their last entertainment went to the Good
Templars' Home lor Orphans at Vailejo, but
the destination of the lunds raided to-night Is
notyet determined.

N ineteen bids for the construction of the
building and sanitary arrangements of
the new Mission High School were opened
at the meeting of the Board of Education
last evening, and were referred to the
committee of the whole to meet this
afternoon at 2 o'clock.
The bids ranged from $119,908 to $128,
-991, and each bidder put in a number of
lenders according to the character of tbe
materials to be used. These matters must

heating and ventilating apparatus irom
$1580 to $9300.
Solomon Ducas, who negotiated the
tale of the Mission High School lot with
the board, sent in a communication re
questing that the board make a formal
contract for the purchase. He stated in a
communication that he had been advised
that such a step was necessary for the
mandamus proceedings which be intends
to bring to compel the Auditor to sign the
warrant for the purchase price. The form
of contract was submitted ana adopted by
tbe board.

GETS NO ALIMONY.
Else Ballard 'h Peculiar Ground of Ac-
tion Against Irving X. Ballard,
Her Ex-Husband 't Father.
Else Ballard, the divorced wife of Alfred
H. Ballard, began a peculiar suit in the
Justice court yesterday. The defendant
is Irving T. Ballard, the father of her ex
husband.
She alleges that she was divorced on
July 10 and granted $35 per month ali
mony and the custody of her minor child;
that after the decree was granted the de
fendant advised and assisted Alfred H.
Ballard to avoid payment of the alimony,
and that she has received but $35.
. She asks that inasmuch as Irving T. Bal
lard was responsible for the non-payment
of the balance, he be ordered to set
tle with her for $210, the sum due for six
months' aiimony.
DR. SIEBERST IMPROVING.
Hig Burns as Santa Clans Came Near
Causing Pneumonia Sunday.
The Christmas-tree experience of Dr. W.
H. Sieberst, dentist, who resides at the
comer of Nineteenth and Valencia streets,
nearly led to more serious consequences
than severe burns. Suaday the physi
cians in attendance thought it probable
that he would have pneumonia as the di
rect cause of his burns and the inhalation
of smoke and the hot fumes of bis ignited
cotton Santa Claus disguise. Yesterday
he was much better, and last night he
seemed on the high road to recovery.
Dr. Sieberit was burned Christmas eve,
just about midnight, at a party given for
children by Miss Sadie Gould at 3450
Nineteenth street. He entered the room
with a cotton coat, and on his bead was a
cotton cap. A 9 he reached up to the
Christmas tree to remove toe gifts the cot
ton coat caught fire from one of the tapers
on the tree, and in a second his cap was
also aflame. His face and hands were
very badly burned, and also his body.
Since that time his friends have been
anxious concerning him. Many persons
have called to inquire about him. Yester
day was the first time since the accident
that he seemed to be out of danger.
FILLMORE-STREET CLUB.
Some of the Things the Member* Be
lievÂ«> They Will Accomplish.
The Fillmorf-street Improvement Club
was to have held a meeting in lower
Franklin Hall last night, but probably
owing to some misunderstanding as to
date too few members appeared to consti
tute a quorum, consequently there was no
business transacted.
Since the celebration last Wednesday
night a number of property-owners have
voluntarily joined the club and subscribed
to the electric-light fund.
The club now numbers 123 active mem
bers and 22 associate members. At
the next meeting it will adopt a con
stitution and by-laws, and place itself
on a solid working basis, with a view to
carrying out certain contemplated im
provements, which will result in the bet
terment of business on that street It is
the intention to have the matter of side
walks looked after; to clean out an un
improved lot near Butter street, and to in
fuse life in the storekeepers and induce
them to make efforts to reach out for the
trade west of the street.
RAPHAEL PEIXOTTO, who was n amed by Judee Slack to act as foreman of the
Grand Jury just empaneled, is a man of known energy and capacity for the trying
duties of that position. He is a man of ripe years and business experience, and fully
understands what demands of time and personal inconvenience the responsible
position will make upon him. He promises a liberal response to them; to look
carefully into suspected evils and to work reforms where they are found wanting and
possible to be wrought. Mr. Peixotto is head of the firm of Peixotto & Silverman,
and father of Assistant District Attorney Edward Peixotto.

TOLD THE WOE
OF A YOUNG WIFE
Andrew Schuller Is Ac
cused of Cruelty and
Fraud.
Twice Stabbed the Woman He
Had Promised to Cherish
and Protect.
Charles Maxon, a Son-in-Law of
Scbuiler, Implicated in an Al
leged Conspiracy.
Mrs. Eugenic Scbuiler, by her attorney,
Henry H. Davis, yesterday filed a com
plaint against her husband, Anarew
Schuller, which puts him in anything but
a favorable light; and Charles C. Maxon,
a son-in-law of Schuller, is also brought in
for a siiaro of her condemnation.
Mrs. Schuller sets forth that she *nd
Andrew Schuller were married in 1894,
and that they still bear the relationship
of husband and wife, though their life as
such has been far from happy. She says
that on the 25;h of last November he
abandoned and deserted her without cause
or provocation and continues to live sepa
rate from her.
The complaint alleges that almost daily
from Jhe time of their marriage Schulier
treated her in a cruel and inhuman man
ner; that he violently assaulted her and
applied to her vile and vulgar names and
epithets too vile to be mentioned; that
be frequently struck her on the head and
face wuh bis fist, kicked her, threw her
about, injuring her in person and general
health.
Particularizing her grievances, Mrs.
Schuller says that in March, 1895, her
husband stabbed her in the neck with a
Knife, intending to kill her, and the loÂ«s
of blood caused by tbe wound made her
weak and ill lor several months; that on
the 25th of last month, which by the way
was the day before Thanksgiving day, he
again abused and assaulted he and again
stabbed her with a kniie, cutting her in
the forehead, the wound therefrom re
sulting leaving a scar on her face for
many days.
Touching her husband's disposition
Mrs. Schuller says thai be has a violent
temper and that it is dangerous for her to
live with him; that he is greatly influ
enced in his cruel and inhuman conduct
toward her by the persuasions of his
daughter, Mabel Cool, who on one occa
sion in November, 1896, said to the de
fendant that her only hope and desire
was that he would kill this plaintiff, Mra.
Schuller.
If Mrs. Schnller had the means that
properly belong to her she suggests she
would not so bitterly comnlain. but she
avers that in addition to refusing to furnish
the necessaries of life Schuller cajoled from
her by divers means and misrepresenta
tions since their marriage certain moneys
belonging to her before their marriage,
which was her own separate property;
that he gave her his notes for the money,
but has failed to repay the same; and that
now, having taken her property, he has
abandoned her and has faiied to provide
for her; that frequently she has gone
without meals for two days at a time,
thereby making her ill and greatly im
pairing her health; that she is wholly
without means and is dependent on the
charity of friends.
It is well known that every woman has
a right to something to wear, yet Mra.
Schuller declares that her husband since
their marriage has never purchased for
her any clothing or wearing apparel of
any kino, although he has and at all
times since their marriage has possessed
the means and ability to do so.
On this point Mrs. Schuller continues
by saying that Scbuiler has stated to her
on numerous occasions that lie has money,
but that he has fixed it with Charles C.
Maxon, bis son-in-law, for the purpose of
preventing any court or lawyer from com
pelling him to support her or to return
the money which he has fraudulently
taken from her.
Schuller seems to have chosen the day
before Thanksgiving as the occasion for
ending his marital disagreements, for she
alleges that on said day, on returning to
the apartments occupied by them at the
Beresford House in this City, she found
him about to vacate the rooms with his
personal effects, leaving her to face the
landlady, to whom he owed $60 for their
board and lodging; whereupon she re
monstrated with him for in such a sur
reptitious manner leaving the premises,
carrying with him his personal belongings,
leaying tbe trunks and wearing auparel of
this plaintiff subject to the lien ol the
landlady for the board bill.
Disregarding her appeal Schulier per
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 29, 1896.
sisted in his purpose and did leave, so her
trunks and clothing are still heid by the
proprietress of the hotel as security for
the debt.
Charles C. Maxon comes into the case
at this point, for Mr?. Schuller avers that
Schuller has transferred all his property
to Maxon for the purpose of defrauding
her by preventing her from recovering the
money ttiat is rightfully due her and also
to defeat any application she may make
for alimony or permanent support. She
asks that Schuller and Maxon be adjudged
guilty of fraud and that the transfer oi
property before mentioned be declared
null and void; that Schuller be required
to pay a reasonable sum as alimony pend
ing the hearinc of her suit for the re
covery of her property, and that Schuller
and Maxon be restrained from disposing
of or in any manner incumbering the
property transferred by Schuller to Mjixon.
Judgo Belcher, acting as Presiuine
Judge, considering Mrs. Schuller's un
fortunate predicament, remitted all the
fees of court in her suit.
WORKING FOR THE BALLOT.
Woman Suffragists Preparing to Work
at the Slate Capital.
The woman stiffraee campaign before
the coming Legislatuie is pretty well
mapped out. The necessary committee
has been named to take charge of the
work in hand. There is no thought on the
part of those who were the leaders in the
movement for the adoption of the pro
posed sixth amendment to the constitu
tion of this State of abandoning the
work or of abating their efforts in the
least. Daily some of the enthusiastic ad
vocates of woman suffrage may be found
at the headquarters oi the California State
Woman Suffrage Association. Tnere dis.
cussions occur frequently, but they are
all concerning the best way to forward
the c;iuse to which they are all pledged.
"All that tnere is for us to do at the
present time," said a lady prominent in
the woman suffrage movement, "is to
bring before the Legislature the measure
to once more sutmm the amendment to
the people for adoption. If the Legisla
ture takes favorable action and permits
the people to again express their opinion,
that will be the first step. As we study
the figures of the recent election we find
no reason for discouragement. We did
not get the amendment adopted, but we
polled many votes, enough to show that
the idea ol woman suffrage has taken
strong hold in California and that what is
needed is education to insure final s ac
cess."
The organization of woman suffrage
clubs has progressed somewhat since the
election. The purpose is to have at least
one woman suffrage club in every As
sembly district in the State.; At these
clubs there will be frequent debates. The
clubs will be the rallying points for the
movement. It has been determined to
continue^the educational work whether
the Legislature shall act favorably or
otherwise in reference to the submission
anew of the amendment. Probably the
first move at Sacramento will be made
early during the lexislative session. A
strong delegation cf woman suffragists
will visit the State capital whenever it
shall seem advisable. The headquarters
in the Parrott building will be kept open
indefinitely.
William Shells' Estate.
An inventory of appraisement of the estate
of William Shiels deceased has been filed in
the County Clerk's office, showing a valuation
of $621,821 90. The property is principally
composed of inside real estate in this City.
COUNT AXEL WACHTMEISTER, Local Leader of the Besaot
Section of Theosophists.
THEOSOPHY IS
TAKING ROOT
Great Activity in Local
Circles During the
Past Year.
The Besant Faction Aids India
and the Judge People to
Build a Temple.
Count Wachtmeister Tells How the
New Gospel Grows in America
and India.
The close of the year witnesses un
exampled activity among the various
factions of local theosnpbists.
That progressive branch led by Mrs.
Annie Besant in India and elsewhere, and
just now championed by Count Axel
Wachtmeister in local circles, is doing
all in its power to relieve the sufferers of
India, while the branch led by Judge ex
pects to build an occult temple in this
State next year, and to keep up the work
of evangelization until the world is
spanned with the teachings of theosophy.
"I have been here about a month," said
Count Wachtmeister yesterday, "and I
am just now editing the Mercury in this
City. At a subscription of $1 a year we
do not conduct it to make a fortune, but
to enlighten the world. v
"There is much activity in India an
Europe just now among tbeosophists, and
great progress is being made here also.
My mother has just established societies
at Spokane, Fargo, Butte and Stieridan,
so you see there is some culture in what
some people designate the 'wild and
woolly' West."
The following appeal for the sufferers of
India is being widely circulated among
theosophists who belong to the Besant
section:
It is a matter of common knowledge that
the famine area in India already involves a
population numbering millions. The price of
iood is treb.e, and the wide-reaching disaster
is aggravated by the fact that no less than 80
per ceut of the teeming population of India is
agricultural and depends for its livelinood
solely on the crops. The spring crop partially
faiied; the autumn crop has entirely failed,
and, though some rain has at last fallen, until
the next crop Is sown and reaped hundreds of
thousands will be ruined and destitute.
Six months ago Mrs. Anuie Besant appealed
through the public press of India and Eng
land for help, and was the means of keeping
alive a, number of the starving but uncom
plaining natives. At that time the famine
area was very restricted, but since then the
terrible pest has increased with leaps and
bounds. Mrs. Besant is now on the spot, iv
the region where the famine is the worst, and,
according to her liie-long custom, is busily
employed In mer.sures for the reliei of the suf
lering humanity about her.
Committees have been formed by members
of the Theosophicai Society in India to co
operate with the Government iv bringing
co in tort and relief to as many sufferers as pos
sible. The Indian representations of this
worldwide brotherhood beingin direct contact
with the suffering ones, ana numbering sev
eral hundred branches and centers through
out the whole of India, are well qualified to
administer a relief mnd and make every cent
tell. The Theosophicai Society is a non-secta
rian body, undone of Its chief objects is the
amelioration of suffering humanity. The
members ot this society are not able indi
vidually to fully meet the demand, and they
ask contributions to the famine fund.
Many who have no interest in theosophy
will undoubted, j- be glad to know where to
place contributions with a certainty of their
t>eing wisely distributed. A very little goes a
long way in India. A cent a day per head will
not only keep body and soul together but pro
vide a sufficiency. Millions of pennies are
needed, however. Mrs. Besant has just issued
another appeal to her colleagues in the Occi
dent, and any contributions that the public
in San Francisco and California may wish to
offer will be .thankfully received and should
be sent to Count A. Wachtmeister, theoitophi
cal headquarters, 414 Mason street, San Fran
cisco. A list oi ibe contributions will be
acknowledged through the public press.
The Blavatsky-Judge laction proposes
to establish an occult temple in this State
this year. It is said that the proposed
temple will be the only one of its kind in
the world. In it adepts will teach the
mysteries of antiquity. Tuition, it is pro
posed, will be free, and any one who de
sires instruction will be admitted.
The following is an account of the plan
written by one of the adepts:
The plan of study has not yet been definitely
announced, but it is understood that all ihe
mysteries of the ancient religions will be im
parted to the students. Thought transference,
or the art of projecting the mind's ideas
through space into the mind of another, will
be one of the least of the powers acquired. In
terior penetration will be another attribute of
the psychologically developed soul. This Is
the power of understanding the nature of a
thing without any apparent effort of the
mind, such as knowing the contents of an un
opened letter. The HStrai body of an adept
will be capable of transference from one part of
the world to another while the physical body
remains stationary. The will will be devel
oped to the extent of being able to cause death
by a simple volition.
The trip of the Crusaders around the world
is the first of its kind. The dedication ot the
college of occult science in March will be the
chief objeDtot their visit to California. This
college will be the consummation oi one of
the hopes witn which theosophy has been
pursued. It will be the revival of the ancient
knowledge of the soul and the soul's powers,
ana undoubtedly one of the most unique and
interesting spots iv -the world.
The Swedes Won
By an inadvertence It was stated in the
report of the tug-of-war at Sutro's oaths on
Sunday that the Norwegian team had won
from the Swedish, when the contrary was the
case. The Swedish team has not yet been
defeated.
WILLIAM E. LUTZ, at the meeting of the newly impaneled Grand Jury on
Saturday, was chosen to serve as its secretary. Mr. Lutz is a prominent figure in San
Francisco business circles, being secretary of a number of leading building and loan
associations. His identification with the Grand Jury as its secretary will serve to
indicate the strong character of that body as at present constituted. He is young and
energetic and will exert an active influence in the work of the Grand Jury, of which
work much is to be expected.
OLYMPIC GROUNDS
TO BE CLOSED
Peter Mclntyre, the Care
taker, to Have a Club
Billet.
Four Nights' Athletics in the
Mechanics' Pavilion Under
Consideration.
Grand Schemes Which E W. Newhali
and the Directors Have in
Contemplation.
The president of the Olympic Club, E.
W. Newhali, is very well satisfied with the
club's progress.
''The membership is increasing daily,"
said Mr. Newhali, "which proves beyond
question that the club is in a prosperous
condition.
"The present board of directors work
In harmony, and its members will leave
nothing undone to advance the interests
of the club in every particular.
"Yes, we have several schemes under
consideration which will add materially
to the growth of the club when they
materialize. Of course we intend to re
duce expenses that are deemed unneces-
sary. For instance, the closing of the
outdoor grounds, which will come into
effect about the first of the year, will save
the club the salary it pays the caretaker.
"This move the directors would not
acquiese in if the members indulged to
any extent in outdoor sports. Possibly
Mr. Mclntyre, who has been in the employ
ol the club as manager of the grounds
since the time of their inauguration, may
be appointed to some office in the build
ing where his services will be of more
value to the members. He is a first-class
trainer of athletes, and I have no doubt
that his services will be sought and appre
ciated by members who participate in
various athletic pastimes.
"To-morrow afternoon the directors will
hold a special meeting for the purpose of
devising plans and schemes for the future.
"Our leader, Mr. Howard Taylor, ar
ranged for a series of amusements imme
diately after his inauguration â a series
which, I am pleased to say, was very suc
cessfully managed to the end of the pres
ent year. Now, then, we propose to give
Mr. Taylor carte blanche, so to speak, in
the arrangement of a programme of ath
letic and social amusements for the in
coming year, as he has manifested marked
ability in catering to the wishes of the
members.
''I dare say that the club will give a
wrestling tournament in January or Feb
ruary, which will be opened to the repre
sentatives of bona-tide amateur athletic
clubs west of the Rocky Mountains, and
perhaps a special inducement will be of
fered tor a return match between Herbert
Greenland of the Muitnomah Athletic
Club of Portland, Or., and Charles Kreling
of ihe Olympics. These crack amateur
wrestlers met in a contest at Portland in
June last, when a team of athletes from
our club nivnded that country, athletic
ally rtent, and I understand that Kreling
was defeated because the referee did not
do him justice. However that may have
been, I think that a return match, to be
decided under the auspice* of the Olympic
Club, will prove a most interesting event
and I can assure you that the invader will
be accorded a fair field and no favor.
"Among the many good athletic features
that have been suggested for the next
year in an aquatic tournament which will
embrace many novel things. Besides
swimming, which will be the principal
feature, there is a proposition on foot to
hold also an aquatic tug-of-war in the
swimming tank. Among the members
who are athletically and aquatlcally in
clined I have no doubt that several teams
can be secured to contest in boats or
racing shells on the same principle as a
tug-of-war on cleats. The boats will be
stationed in the center of the tank and each
boat will be secured by a rope, say three
feet in length. The crew which succeeds
in rowing or polling its opponent over a j
certain line will be awarded the decision.
Tne winners of the first round will meet
in the second trials, and so on until the
last or final trial will decide who are
champions in the first aquatic tug-oi-war
that has been introduced in this country.
The contests should prove amusing, inter
esting and instructive.
"Several new features will be introduced
at the next ladies' night entertainment.
The last one was a most pronounced suc
cess, in fact the gymnasium was not large
enough to accommodate the people rep
resented in the club.
"What will unquestionably prove to be
the event of the year will be discussed at
length to-morrow. Our idea is to give a
mammoth all-round athletic exhibition in
Mechanici' Pavilion either in April or in
the latter part of the fiscal year. The pro
gramme will include all branches of atn
letic-s and if the scheme passes mnster
the Pavilion will be leased for four days,
as we propose to give an entertainment
each evening which will be interspersed
with vocal and instrumental music.
"Oh, yes, the present board is wide
awake to the interests of the club, and
some astonishing features will be Intro
duced for the edification and pleasure of
the members during the year of 1897."

FIGHTING THE PESTHOUSE
Mayor Sutro Will Go to the Legislature
at the Coining ><-Â»sion.
Mayor Sutro has not given up bis fight
to keep the Pesthouse off the Almshouse
I tract, but has decided to go to the Legis-
I lature for relief.
With Senator Wolf of the Twenty-first
Senatorial District and Assemblyman
Mulcrevy oftthe Twenty-seventh Assembly
District as his friends to start with, he
will endeavor to have passed a bill mak
ing it unlawful to locate any pesthouse or
hospital for contagious diseases within
halt a mile of any lake or reservoir from
which water is drawn for public use.
As Laguna Honda is right on the border
of the Almshouse tract this measure will,
if passed, prevent the location of the Pest
house on that public domain.
Should this fail the Mayor says he has
anoiher measure ready.
"My attorney informs me," he said yes
terday, ''that I can have the Board of Su
pervisors enjoined from building the Pest
house on the Almshouse site, or anywhere
in fact- where contagion may reach the
residents of the district, on the ground
that it is a menace to the public health.
"This is, in my m md, oue of the greatest
outrages that was ever perpetrated by
Hun ling ton and his hirelings. They want
to injure me, and tLey would inflict dire
injury on thousands of people in order to
accomplish their fends.
"I am going to fight though, you can
rest assured of that, as long as there is a
leg to stand on, and these people will
know they have had a battle before I
give up."

PROSPERITY IS
DUE AND CERTAIN
Robert Dickson Tells of the
Business Situation
East.
Stocks in Trade Were Never So
Lew and Merchants Are
Filling Big Orders.
Doubt About the Action of the New
Administration as to the Tariff
the Only Check.
Robert Dickson, the well-known insur
ance man, has returned from bis annual
tour through the East ana is stocked up
with business, it being one of the purposes
of his journey to gather the same.
Mr. Dickson speaks of the Chicago bank
failures as being very unfortunate, but
says it is only a local incident. The causes
are local, he says, and there need be no
fear that the effect will be felt in this
direction or anywhere that there is not a
similar cause â local mismanagement
Mr. Dickson is full of hope for the
future, inspired by what he saw and heard *
in the East. He says the coming year f
promises to be one of the best in a busi
ness sense that has been known in the
history of the country. That, he says,
is the universal expectation of business
men in the East.
"I was in the East on fllection-day and
for some time previous to it," said Mr.
Dickson yesterday. "I met scarcely one
business man of any importance who did
not predict disaster should Bryan be
elected and prophesy prosperity in the
event of McKinley's triumph. In that
unanimity of opinion there was, of
course, great confidence; but still busi
ness men are conservative, and most of
them preferred to wait until the result
should be known before they took any
step contingent upon the continued main
tenance of a sound financial system.
The 3d of November settled that matter,
and the entire country is now preparing
itself for a big revival in trade.
"I never knew a time in my experience
when tht> general stocks of the merchants
and manufacturers of the country were so
ioÂ»v," continued Mr. Dickson. "I visited,
for instance, one of the largest dealers in
carpets in the country during my stop in
Chicago. One of the proprietor? told me
thnt if they should receive an order for
the furnishing of a large residence they
would be compelled to go to the whole
saler for the goods, so short was their own
stock. This is simply one instance of
what I found everywhere. The stocks in
trade in almost every line from one end of
the country to the other are run down.
Now the mere replenishing of these stocks
would necessitate the running of mills at
high pressure. This will be "done, and is
being done, for the utmost confidence pre
vails as to an uninterrupted period of
prosperity in the land, and mercants must
prepare for it. The preparation itself will
prove a strong influence in hurrying the
new era.
"The doubt, however, regarding the ac
tion of the incoming administration as to
the tariff will serve as a check to tbe dis
position of merchants to stock up. If
there is to be any benefit to them, or if
they think there is, one way or another,
in waiting for a few months longer they
will, of course, wait. Were it not for this
element in the situation lam confident â 
that the opening of spring would find the Â¥
country enjoying the thrill of a big. "
healthy trade revival. If it comes to be
known that McKinley intents to call an
extra session of Congress for the purpose
oi amending the revenue or tariff laws
then there may be something of a post
ponement of t > is revival until the busi
ness is settled. At any rate, this year is,
I am sure, to see a return of prosperity to
the country."
THE HUDELSON LIBEL.
Another Afternoon laken Up, With But
Little Progress Made.
The preliminary examination of Benja
min F. Hudelsoa, charged, with libel by
Attorney D. B. Woodworth, was con
tinued before Judge Gampbeil yesterday
afternoon.
The defendant's cross-examination by
Attorney Wood worth was resumed, but
very little progress was made. The Judge
sot exasperated and characterized both
the defendant and complaining witness as
two of the most verbose men he had ever
encountered, and he implored them both
to get down to the facts in the case.
The court did not adjourn till 5 o'clock
and the whole time was occupied in en
deavoring to find out the person or per
sons to whom the defendant showed the
statement dictated by Woodworth to Hud
elson's stenographer as to the payment of
$55,000 in different amounts for the mine.
The hearing will be contained to-mor
row afternoon. , .

ABOUT THE WORK
Caucus of the San Fran
cisco Assemblymsn-
Elect.
Their Decision as to How They
Shall Act on Certain
Propositions.
Prominent Measures Proposed to Be
Urged During the Coming Session
of the Legislature.*
The San Francisco Assemblymen-elect
held a caucus last night in Justice of tbe
Peace Carroll's courtroom and discussed
matters in which they had a common in
terest, irrespective of politics, in the com
ing teasion of the Legislature.
The meeting partook more of a social
tnan a business character and tbe greater
part of the time of the session was occu
pied by the members in gettins acquainted
with one another. There were present:
W. H. Gately, E. S. Ryan, F. Lundquist,
L. A. Henry, H. C. Dibble, Leon E.
Jones^ G. Pohtman, H. I. Mulcrevy, H.
| McGrath, L. J. Dolan, F. Maloney, G. B.
Godirey, J. H. Power, J. Treacy, JEL M.
Kelly, J. Allen and E. F. Lacy.
The recommendation recently made by
a committee of Senators appointed at the
last session of the Legislature to the effect
that bills when introduced should not be
printed, but referred to a committee,
which should reject duplicate bills or ex
clude from printing unimportant bills,
engage! the attention of the caucus. The
Assemblymen were unanimously in op
position to the scheme.
They were quite willing that tbÂ« Senate
should make all the rules it wanted in
reference to Senate bill?, bat were firm in
the position that every Assemblyman's
rivht to introduce a bill and have that
bill printed and a copy of it placed 6n tbe
â  desk of every member should be re
spected.
Tue seventeen Assemblymen present
teemed to favor the idea of a primary elec
tion law, similar in a cenera'l sense to the
law which was passed at tbe last session
of the Legislature and declared unconsti
tutional ppr3 r the Supreme Court. The ob
jections indicated by tbe court can be
Miss Ella Dales Miles.
[From a photograph by Hudson.]
noted and the law framed so as to become
operative.
As the Legislature is Republican in both
branches, and ttie caucus was composed of
eleven Democrats and six Republicans,
questions of patronage were not dis
cussed. The talk was informal. It was
decided to defer the permanent organiza
tion of the delegation untii the members
shall meet in Baorameuto.
One invitation wa3 accepted. The As
semblymen agreed to become the guests
of the State Board of Harbor Commis
sioners for a trip around the bay to
morrow.
Big Bettman was the only Assembly
man absent. He was seen at the Bald
win Hotel last evening. He said he had
no intention of holding aloof from the
conference and that his absence was
mainjv due to his own negligence.
Beve"ral members of the delegation in
tend to leave for Sacramento next Friday
evening and the others will start next Sat
urday morning. One of the delegation
observed facetioualy that it would be
wiser, better and safer to leave on New
Year's night than to try to get up at 6
o'clock in the morning the day atter with
that tired malarious feeling and attempt
to catch the train.
The Assembly delegations will hold a
caucus in Sacramento next Saturday even
ing and the Senate will caucus on Sunday,
so that there will be no day of rest on the
first Sunday at the beginning of the year,
nor on any other Sunuay during the ses
sion, for that matter.
The coming session of the Legislature
promises to be replete with interest. Econ
omy will be the battle-cry on one aide,
and to the victors belong the spoils will be
the slogan on the other. The past has not
been a prosperous year with wool and raisin
growers under the Democratic system
of non-protectiou, and the wine-growers
would have been much better off had tneir
industry been protected. The tiller of the
soil, the shepherd and the stock-raiser
have been hard hit, and therefore the rep
resentatives from the bucolic woods and
meadows have been instructed to fight for
economy and retrenchment.
Itis likely that there will be a concerted
movement against the bureaus and com
missions which have increased so rapidly
during the past decade and whose salary
and maintenance bills are heavy drafts
upon the State treasury. It is said by the
representatives of the granger element
that the greater part of these bureaus are
sinecures â that they are shaÂ«iy alcoves of
repose generously providtd by tbe law
makers for the reward of their faithful
friends.
They say that tbe State Mining Bureau
is for the benefit only of rich men who
are assisted in the sale of mining proper
ties by the recommendations of tbe State
Mineralogist. Then there are the Yo
Semite Commission, two State prisons and
four or live insane asviums (iuey are
multiplying so fast that* it is difficult to
keep track of them) when one of each
would do. An attempt will be made to
boil the two penitentiaries into one and
the irKane asylums into one, which coun
try members say will be a great saving.
But tnev are net willing to abolish or
hamper the usefulness of the Viticulturul
and Horticultural commissions, and this
is tlie lever which the friends oi the other
bureaus will use to hoist the country
delegates il they become too troublesome.
The agricultural representatives are
very tender on the subject of the Horti
cultural Commission, and it will be re
membered what a cold frost was tendered
Governor Bndd at the conclusion of his
address in the Assembly chamber last
summer at the annual meeting of the
State Horticultural Society-
Reformers will make another effort to
have the Torreua iand act adopted. Like
the present election law, the, Torrens act
is a native of Australia, a country which
is making kangaroo strides in the direc
tion of political pr^erress. The bill was
introduced at the last session and was
placed in the bands of a banker, a real es
tate man and a searcher of records, who
reported that it was a very good thing in
Australia, but that it was rather too ten
der a plant to thrive in the climate of Cal
ifornia.
The Torrens act takes a fiesh start in
tbe matter of titles. It establishes tbe
title of the present owner of a piece of real
estate, and if there is no adverse claim
pending all the past transactions in the
record are wiped out. The new law would
paralyze the searcher of records, because'
most of their work consists in searching
the same records over and over again
every lime a sale of the property is made.
What the tlaiiymen propose to do lor
the protection of their interests was told
by Assemblyman .Damon of Humboldt in
insi Sunday's Call, and it will not be
uecessary to repeat it here,
The association of S*n Francisco teach
ers has appointed Thomas H. McCarthy
to take care of the proposed amendments
to the teachers' pension law. The act as
passed at the last session of the Legisla
ture contains some delects which the
teachers wish to remedy. The law, as it
now stand?, provides that a pension
of $50 jer month Bhall be paid
to each superannuated teacher who
shall nave served in the San Francisco
School D partment for twenty years. It
is proposed to amend by fixing the period
at thirty years of service, and if a teacher
should De incapacitated in the perform
ance of her or his duties before the ex
piration of thirty years ot service she or
he shall receive, instead of the lull pen
sion, only as many thirtieths of tbe same
as there are years of service.
The pension luna is made up of 1 per
cent of tbe salaries of the teacners sub
scribing thereto. It is proposed to amend
this provision by allowing the 1 per cent
payment to run for fifteen years, after
which time the payment? shall be at the
rate of 2 per cent, of the salary.
Another amendment creates a board of
live 'teachers, whose duty it shall be to
pass upon the claims of persons desiring
to be pensioned, and to designate those
wbo may be entitled to that relief. It is
aiso provided that in case of a deficiency
there shall be a pro rata pension, and the
fund shall not contract any debt thereby.
One quarter of all the moneys placed in
the permanent fund shall be "us d in thÂ«
payment of annuities, and the permanent
fund shall remain intact until it has
reached $50,000, after which it shall go
into the annuity fund and will be invested
in State or municipal interest-bearing
bonds. Parts of salary forfeited because
of absence from school will be pldced in
the fund.
There is now $5000 in the treasury and
seven pensioners drawing $350 per month.
As the amendment win not increase
taxation, the fund being made up volun
tarily by the teachers themselves, it will
not likely be opposed.
Foreign Song Uirda for Parks.
An interesting experiment is to be tried
in Lincoln Park, Chicago, which, if suc
cessful, will add a new feature to the at
tractions of that beautiful resort. About
fifty of the choicest kinds of European
song birds, including linnets, goidoncb.es,
bullfinctied, and other varieties, have been
imported, and they will spend the winter
in the spacious paim house of the con
servatory. They will be properly fed and
cared for, a^d it is believed tney will do
well, as the^winter temperature of the
palm house is about the same as that of
the latitudes from which they came. In
the late spring the little songsters will be
released an : allowed to seek nesting
places in the pane trees, or make their
homes inside the building at their own
iweet will. Practical ornithologists are of
opinion that the birds will remain in the
vicinity of their winter Quarters during
the summer to raise ti eir young, and
that the colony will eventually become a
populous one. At any rate the experi
ment was thought worth trying, and if it
turns out well the visitors to the park
next summer will be charmed with some
of the sweetest bird music known. Here
tofore the feathered population of Lincoln
Park has been limited to very ordinary
native varieties, principally bluejays and
robins. Â«

What Acting: Secretary Curtis Has to
Say About the Proposed Postofflce

The following terse correspondence be
tween John L. Bardwell of this City and
W. E. Curtis, Acting Secretary of the
Treasury at Washington, will not be with
out interest to patient San Franciscans,
although it does not illuminate the sub
ject discussed to any alarming extent:
San Francisco, Dec. 14, 1896.
To the Honorable the Secretary of the Treasury,
Washington, D. ttâ Dkae Sib: It is nearly
twenty-live years since prominent men of
San Francisco commenced agitating for a new

The Polished Copper Urn Containing Kate Field's Ashes.
Kate Field's ashes are speeding eastward in charge of General Charles H.
Taylor, proprietor of the Boston Globe.
The last remains of the celebrated woman litterateur, editor and journalist are
incased and locked in a small cylindrical jar of polished copper. There ia no
inscription on the shining surface of the improvised urn. Passing over the top
of the plain cover and through three littie clasps â one on the cover and one
on eacii sideâ is a narrow lavender ribbon to which is attached a card bearing
the customary record from the crematory, together with the name and dite.
The ends of the ribbon are fastened together below the card by a disk of black
sealing wax upon which is the lettered impress of the Odd Fellows' Crematory.
A very little brass padlock clasped through staples holds the cover securely
in place.
All that is earthly of the woman who wrote fearlessly and wrote well is con
tained in that case, probably nine inches in height and six inches in diameter.
General Taylor, the custodian of the sacred ashes, left here for Chicago on
last nieht's overland train. He will deliver the urn to Editor Kohisaat of the
Chicago Inver Ocean, who, as an old friend of the deceased, purposes to see that
the remains, according to Miss Field's wish, are interred at Mount Auburn
Cemetery, New York.
A LITTLE HITCH
IN WILLIAMS CASE
Final Distribution Inter
rupted by a Forgot
ten Claim.
Joseph L. Moody D a mands Re
payment ol $n,ooo, With
Legal loterest.
Peculiar Position of a Man Wh
Could Neither G?t His Land
Nor His Money.
There was a surprise fn the T. H. Wil
liams estate when the matter of the final
distribution of the property came up for
consideration before Ju Ige Coffey in the
Probate Court. It was expected that the
decree of distribution would be signed, tbe
executor of the will discharged, and that
the probate proceedings that have lasted
for more than ten years would be closed.
This result would have been reached,
and Thomas H. Williams Jr. would now
be in sole and undisputed possession of
bis patrimony had not ai obstacle been
placed in the way by Thomas Magee,
agent for Joseph L. Moody, who has a
claim of $11,000 against the Tnomes H.
Williams estate, with accruing interest
from beptemberlO, 1890.
The manner in which this obligation on
the part of the estate arose is an exempli
fication of tlie queer entanglements that
are possible when a Jot of eminent attor
neys are engaaed in important litigation.
Iv 1890 George E. Williams, executor of
the will of Thomas H. Williams, made a
contract to sell a certain tract to Gustave
Niebaum for $10,000, and in due course of
time tiled a return of the sale ir the Pro
bate Court, asking for a conri Tuation of
tbe sale, the purchase price having been
paid and a deed given.
A uay was appointed for hearing the
application of the executor for a confirma
tion of his act, and on that date Mr.
Moody appeared and offered $11,000 for the
property.' The executor of tbe will ac
cepted the money, it being understood
that he would hold it until ttie matter was
settled by the courts as to whether Nie
baura or Moody had"a right to buy the
land.
The Probate Court took the view that,
as tbe executor had asked for a continua
tion of Ins sale, he had recognized tbe
jurisdiction of the court to make such an
order, and if the court had power to ap
prove such action of course it bad power
to refuse approval. The sale to Niebaum
was therefore ordered set aside and the
executor was directed to deed the prop
erty to Moody.
On this an appeal was made to the
Supreme Court, George E. Williams,
executor of the T. H. Williams estate,
joining in the demand that the decree of
tbe Probate Court be set aside and that
Niebaum be not disturbed in his title to
the land. In support of this view the proÂ»
visions of the will were cited wherein it is
stated that the executor shall have full
power to do with the property exactly as
the testator might have done if living:
that be bhould have authority to lease or
sell any part of the real or personal proD
erty without order of any court or tnbu
nai, and that his acts in this regard
should not bi subject to review by any
c urt. In order to more fully provide for
the carrying out of this design the prop
erty was by the will devised to the execu
tor, in trust, for the benefit of the legatees.
On Â»his showing the Supreme Court re
versed the d< cision of the Probate Court
and left Niebaum in possession of the
land, holding that as the ownershipof tie
property passed directly to the executor
by the provisions of the will the Probate
Court had no jurisdiction of his acts in
disposing of the real estate, and therefore
had no authority to make tbe order ap
pealed from.
Moody then demanded that his $11,000
be returned, and applied to the Probate
Court for an order requiring the executor
to reimburse him. Judge Coffev, before
whom tbe petition was presented, said
mat according to the decision of the Su
preme Court the Probate Court could not
have jurisdiction of the matter in any
phase, and therefore the application for a
mandate on the executor was refused.
This ruling was subsequently sustained
by the Supreme Court.
Moody then brought suit in tbe Bu
Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria.
perior Court for the recovery of his
money, the executor tatiug the position
that it was necessary for a court of com
petent jurisdiction to pass on tbe question
of refunding the money before he would
be in a position to do so, as otherwise he
might be held responsible tb the minor
heirs and others interested in the Thomas
H. Williams estate. Moody obtained judg
ment against the estate for the amount
due, but tbe sum was so small in compari
son with the $2,000,000 involved in the
estate that it was lost sight of fcr a time
and only came up again yesterday becauii i
of tbe public announcement in the Dews
papers mat the estate was about to be
distributed. It was not mentioned in the
acconutof tbe estate's debts. As Moody
stands in the relation of a jud.ment
creditor to the estate be will insist on the
payment of his claim before the decree of
distr.but.ioii is signed.
On application of the attorneys in the
case a continuance was granted until 10
o'clock this morning, at which time a
settlement of the dispute will probably be
made and Moo>ly will eet his money.
HIS WIFE'S PROPERTY.
S. C. Baldwin Sued for the Money In
His Possession.
T. W. Read, as executor of the last will
of Mrs. Caroline F. Baldwin, yesterday
brought two suits by his attorneys, Wal
ter H. Linforth and George E. Whitaker,
against S. C Baldwin *or the purpose of
recovering from the defendant certain
property said to belong to the dead
woman's estate.
At the time of Mrs. Baldwin's death she
was, and for twenty years prior thereto,
had been the wile of the defendant, and
it is charged in tbe complaint that after
her death, on the Bth of last September,
he unlawfully took from East Oakland,
Aiameda County, $487 50 belonging to his
wile's estate, that he converted the same
to his own u.<e and refuses to return tue
same to tbe plaintiff, who is legally enti
tled to possession thereof, though fre
quently requested so to do.
An order of court was asked for requir
ing Baldwin to give up the property thus
unlawfully lield by him.
AFTER A FOURTH TRIAL
Louisa Worthingtoa Asks the
Supreme Court for
Rehearing.
Twice Found Guilty of Murder in the
S cond Degree and Ones Jurors
Disagreed.
Louisa Worthington, who killed Harry
Baddeley, has broken the record in her
attempts to get new trials through the
agency of the Supreme Court. She has
already had three trials. Once the jury
disagreed; twice she has been found
guilty by a jury of murder in the second
degree. The case came first before Judge
Beaweil in lbtu. There were errors dur
ing the trial, and the Supreme Court gave
the woman another chance.
The second trial took place before Judge
Belcherj iv May, 189*. Upon this trial the
jury stood nine for acquittal and three for
conviction. Then the case came before
Judge Wallace to be tried the third time,
und a verdict was found of muroer in the
second degree. The Supreme Court, wnen
an appeal was taken from that judgment,
found that the Superior Court had not
erred, and a new trial was denied.
Nothing daunted by this, Mrs. Worth
ington urged upon her counsel to make
another appeal. The decision of the Su
preme court adverse to her was handed
down just three weeks ago. Yesterday
B. G. HasKell. acting for Mrs. Worthing
ton, tiled a petition for a rehearing.
In this document it ia asserted that
Mrs. Worthington has not had a fair trial,
and the question of whether she was in
sane when the shootiug occurred was dis
cussed.

CRASHED DOWN AN
ELEVATOR SHAFT
The Cage at 120 Sutter
Street Dropped Over
Two Stories.
Four Passengers Narrow y
Escape Death in the Swiit
Descent.
The State University Owns the
Bui ding and Will Now Put In
Modern Apparatus.
An accident occurred to the elevator at
120 Sutter street yesterday aiternoon at
about 1 o'clock that fortunately was at
tended with but slight injury to four men
who were passengers in the cage at the
time.
The exact cause of tbe accident was at
first shrouded in mystery, which went to
the extent of every one connected with
the building refusing to discuss the sub
ject. Eventually the agent of the build
ing, Benjamin Bangs, was found in room
55. on the top floor, and when asked re
garding the affair confessed be knew very
little. All he did know, however, was
that when the elevator was ascending be
tween tbe second and third floors In charge
of tbe elevator-boy, R. H. Jones, it shot
suddenly up and then came down with a
crash, striking the bottom, where it re
bounded some distance, doing very little
damage.
He understood there were three passen
gers in the cage at the time, but who they
were or as to the extent of their injuries
he possessed no knowledge. As to the
cause, his mind was in a similar blank
condition, but he had sent for Mr. Mc-
Nichol, who built the elevator, to make
an examination of the damage and inves
tigate the cause that led thereto.
A further investigation from the janitor,
and the elevator man, Jones, was equally
fruitful of results. All said they had
been cautioned to keep their moutns
closed, and undoubtedly they obeyed or
ders to the letter.
Others, however, who had not been en
joined told what they knew, which is in
the niiiu the correct acoount of the acci
dent.
The elevator was in charge of Gus Le
veque, who is the regular elevator man of
tbe freight elevator which runs in the rear
portion of tbe building, but on this occa
sion he relieved R. H. Jones, the regular
attendant, who went to lunch.
There were three persons besides Le
veque in the cage when it shot up to the
top of tbe shaft They were: J, W.
Thomas, an agent for the Pacific Coast
department of Lamson's Consolidated
Store Service Company; W. N. Sanderson,
janitor of Golden Gate Hall, 625 Sutter
street, and Frederick Schmedmann, an
employe of R. M. Tripp & Co., room 62,
same building. None of them were seri
ously injured.
Dr. W. McNutt, whose office 13 at 301
Sutter street, was summoned to attend to
Frederick Schmedmann and W. N. San
derson, whom be found to be suffering
from a sprained ankle each, with no bones
broken or internal injuries that he could
detect on a hurried examination.
Schmedmann was sent to Dr. AfcNntt's
private hospital on Bush street, while
Sanderson was sent* home in a carriage.
Leveque's only injury was a slightly
abrazed left arm, while Thomas escaped
without any injuries whatever other than
a contused shoulder, where it struck the
caL-e on (he rebound.
The building is now the property of the
California State University, it " having
been recently purchased from the heirs of
tbÂ« Kate Johnson estate.
The elevator is one of old model, such
as were put into buildings some years ago
by McNichol & Co., and was latterly con
aidere â¢ by all to be of a shaky and unsafe
construction at best. So much so, in
deed, that the regents of the university
had given instructions to have it taken
out and a double elevator of modern con
struction put in its place, but at the re
quest of some of the tenants who bad
goods for .'â¢ale thÂ« change had been de
terred until after the holidays. Now the
change will be made without delay.
The highest score in an international
football match was mode by England vs.
Ireland at Belfast in 1881. It was 13 goals
to none.

ONLY THE VERY BEST.
That Is the Advice Which tbe Leading
Physicians of the Land Give.
Thousands of people at this time of the
year find themselves in a low state of
health, and many are now asking tbe
question, "How can I regain health and
strength and feel as I ought to feel f"
For the benefit of people who ask thia
question, it may be stated that some of the
best physicians in the land say that Na
ture requires assistance, the slugcish blood
needs stirring up, impurities driven from
tbe system, and the great organs of the
body endowed with new life. *For produc
ing these effects no stimulant has ever
equaled pure malt whisuey, providing it
really is pure and free from adulteration.
Eminent physicians throughout the world
agree on this point.
Dr. S. Weir-Mitchell, Philadelphia, says:
"I adhertt to the belief that pure whisker
is the least injurious, safest and best alco
holic liquor."
Dr. Frank H. Wade, Pittsburg, says:
"After many years of careful study, I am
firmly convinced that whiskey is the least
injurious, and, therefore, the safest and
best of alcoholic liquors for people to use."
While the above opnions carry weight
and conviction, it must be remembered
that ordinary whisksy cannot be depended
upon, and will usually do more barm than
good. What people in a weak, run-down
condition need is a pure medicinal whis
key, and the only whiskey that has ever
answered this description is Duffy's malt.

to-day, the absence or Liverpool quotationsâ owing
to the continuation of the holiday thereâhav
ing a restraining Influence. The tone of prices
were, neiertbeless. strong, stocks on ocean pas
saged creased 1,1 Ot.oOO bushels, and the world's
shipments were small at 3,837,0> 0 bushels, both
facts tending to Impart confidence to owners of
the grain. London cables were higher, indicating
a firm teeling at other places in hngland. Receipts
at Chicago were 97 cars, and 98.693 bushels were
withdrawn from store. Mloneapo is received 703

small) were for the account of local scalpers an â â 
floor traders. The strength of wh-ai contributed

PAY JUDGMENTS
Streetcar Employes Declare
They Must Organize
for Relief.
Have to Dress Well and Educate
Themselves on $13 a
Week.
Superintendent Rudolph Says There
Are Plenty to Bj Found at
Low Wages.
. Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
. 908 Broadway, Dec. 28. j
The sudden cut in wages on F. M.
Smith's system was the leading topicof dis
cussion among streetcar men to-day. The
general opinion is that unless there be
some organization the lowest waees that
will be paid by the companies is not yet
reached.
The street-railroad companies of this
city follow the peculiar practice of paying
::eir men every night.
. Superintendent Rudolph of the consoli
dated lines said to-day: "The rut from 21
to Â£0 cents was made on aocount of con
omy. It is the purpose of the Realty Syn
dicate to make all its roads pay and have
an income instead of a deficit at the end
of each month. The men are now work
ing eleven hours a day, and although I
do not approve of them working more
than nine or ten houra a day, I will prob
ably not make any chango in this respect
at present. The men understand that the
cut was made on account of hard times,
and I heard no complaints over iL This
talk of a strike being probable is all bosh.
There are plenty of men who want work
and it would be absurd of the men to give
up their positions."
Twenty cents an hour is about the average
paid to all the carmen in this city. With
ten hours' work a day and working six
and a half days each week the men can
thus earn $13 a" week. They have to main
tain decent uniforms and have a deposit
of $25 with the company as a saieguard
against injuring the company's property,
and they declare that 22 cents should be
the minimum.
Some weeks ago the Hay wards Electric
Road commenced a graded scale of pty,
commencing at 19 cents and increasing
with the length of service. This is giving
general satisfaction. In a book of iusti-uc
tjon recently issued to the employes of
this road the remark occurs that it is
prpbable that before long motormen may
ha'Ce'to pass an examination, and urging
them to prepare themselves for such an
emergendy.
AUer referring to the methods of em
ployment and wages of the various roads,
one of the oldest motormen on the con
sojidated^ roads said to-day: "We shall
have to organize a carmen's union, and
th?n perhaps we shall be able to say
something ourselves about the value of
qu'r labor. We are the poorest paid men in
dn& line of business. We have to work
long hours to make enough to MiipDort our
families; we have to eat our meals under
ilifflcu Ities, and we have to do very re
sponsible work.
"Rudolph can say all he wants to about
!' there being plenty of men, but the nnm
-4 her of damage suits that have been de
' cided lately adversely to the corporations
have made them think. A verdict of $10,
-000 mean 3 something, and there have Deen
several of that amount returned by juries
lately. It looks to me a* if we were beins;
cut down to pay for those verdicts. Al
ready some ot the roads have had costly
experience wiih green hands, and I do
not think they would care to have it re
peated."

Married Her Principal.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Dec. 28.â The friends
. of Principal Charles C. Hughes of the En
" cinal School and Miss Lois Estelle Fish,
'â . teacher of the sixth grade of the same
school, will be surprised to learn of their
marriage in San Francisco last Tuesday.
Both appeared in the City Hall early that
morning and drew their salary warrants.
Shortly afterward they left for the City
and were united in matrimony.
Mr. Hughes is a graduate of Stanford
University and a very popular young man.
For some time he taught in the Alameda
University Academy and then succeeded
Mr. de Brish as principal of the Encinal
School. The bride is a graduate of the
State Normal School of San Jose and
daughter of G. C. Fish, the mine-owner.
She formerly taught in the Porter School,
but was transferred to the Encinal School
about the time Mr. Hughes went there.
Only intimate friends were informed of
the affair, which leaked out to-day. The
haprv young people are in Mill Valley
spending; their honeymoon among Mr.
Hughes' former friends. On their return
Saturday they will reside at the bride's
home, 1423 Cottage street.

ALAMEDA, CaiÂ», Dec 28.â The re
moval of the Free Library to the City
HaJl has called forth several uncompli
mentary remarks from Dr. Tisdale, who
owns the rooms formerly occupied, in re
gard to J. G. Brick, the chairman of the
board. Last Saturday Dr. Tisdale accused
Brick of desiring a nomination as mem
ber of the Board of City Trustees and as
serted that he would spend $1000 to defeat
him.
Mr. Brick answers the doctor to-night
in an open letter, in which he says:
Ii the doctor is sincere in his statement that
he will epend jgIOOO in defeating my election
as City Trustee I will make him the lollo'.iins
proposition; That he deposit in the Alameda
Savings Bank the sum of $1000 to the credit
of the AlamedH Free Library building fund
and I will n^ree to refuse any nomination as
City Trustee at the coming election. I am re
speutiully yours, John g. Brick.
it is either a case of mit up or shut up
now and Br ck's friends think the doctor
has the worst cf the bargain. It is not
expected that the doctor will nnswer the
proposition.

i with headquarters in Alameda, will bold
I ils third annual shoot on New Year's day
from 9 A. m. to 12 m. at the ranga of Com
pany G, Eighth Infantry, N. G. C, in
Alameda.
The range was secured through the
kindness of Captain Simpson, who used
bis influence with his company. Previous
to this all parties had been refused the use
! of the range.
The last orders which have just been
! issued stats that every man in the regi

I good scores are looked for.
A gold medal will be presented to the
! enlisted man making the highest score,
t and a handsome trophy will be given to
company which makes the five highest
scores.
Thesp prizes will be contested for each
year, and it is hoped that these induce

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 29, 18H6.
LEAVEITT'S BILL
DIES A-BORNING
Merchants Strongly Oppose
Any Water- Front
Legislation.
But One Sentiment Uttered by
Board of Trade aod
Exchange.
They All Consider the Great Suit
Won, and Object to Any
Interference.
Oakland Office Saw Fbancisco Call,!
90S Broadway, Dec. 28, 1896. f
The commerce of Oakland has spoken
and the water-front bill that Mr. Leavitt
intended to introduce into the Legislature
will never be heard from at Sacramento.
This afternoon the directors of the
Board of Trade and of the Merchants' Ex
change met at the Central Bank building
for tne purpose of hearing Mr. Leavitt's
explanation of his bill and of expressing
their opinion of it.
They heard Mr. Leavitt and they clearly
and unanimously voiced their opinion.
George W. Arper was elected to preside
and he at once aaked Assemblyman
Leavitt to explain his proposed bill.
Mr, Leavitt said: -'I think this bill has
been about as thoroughly discussed as it
can be. I only wish to speak concerning
my motives. During <he last campaign
in niovuig about the district I was spoken
to concerning the water front. People
would tell rue I ought to do something
looking toward the improvement of the
water front. I discussed the proposition
with many people and thought I would
get an open discussion on it, so I gave
notice of my intention to introduce the
bill. The discussion has taken place and
I agreed to leave the decision to repre
sentative merchants of this city. I want
to know what you desire in the matter
and I will abide by your wishes."
E. C. Sessions said it would be very un
wise at this time to do anything that
would hurt the interests of the city. "It
does not so much matter after all," said
Mr. Sessions, "who owns the water front,
prov.ded that title to it is settled for all
time in some party. It will never be im
proved while the title is in doubt."
President Mott of the City Council
spoke for a majority of that body. He
said: ''We deprecate what has already
been done in this matter. It has cost con
siderable money to place the city where it
is, but we have confidence in the attor
neys and in ultimate victory. We feel
certain that the suit will be won, either
lor the city of Oakland or ior the State,
most likely for the State. What I have
heard Mr. Britt say in reference to too
city being unable to improve it, I don't
agree with. We certainly can improve it.
"I look upon the recovery of the water
front of Oakland as ttie main step to fu
ture progress and the prosperity of this
city. As commerce demands will come,
so that the water front i.s required, and as
more needs to bo improved, it can be
easily done. Take the Adams wharf for
instance. It is private property, but was
improved here at some expense a short
time ago, and to-day is one of the busiest
portions of the city upon the water
fiont.
"It will only be a short time â perhaps a
yearâ when we will have to construct a
wharf at the foot of Jefferson street, and
it can be done from year to year; a new
wharf can be put up to keep pace with the
demands of the commerce of the city. I
think it would be rather a bard matter to
get the State to do much for us. We know
what jealousy there is in San Francisco
in regard to other parts of the State ia a
commercial sense. They, with their
influence, could prevent and probably
would prevent the State from doing much
of anytning for Oakland in thp way of
building v. harves und so forth. We know
their action in the Wilmerding School.
By rights that school should have come
to this side of the bay ; but it was more
jealousy and great influence that San
Francisco had that decided in her favor. It
seems to me that the suit at this time is
within probably a few weeks of decision,
and while we have every hope of winning
there is one chance possibly that we
might lose.
"The water-front attorneys think that
we are almost certain to be successful.
Now, it is an easy matter to get a court to 4
order a new trial; possibly by substituting
the name of the State for. the City, or the
introduction of this bill, they might find
some grounds for pleading for a new trial
and obtain it. That means a delay for
several years. -As it. is now, the decision
of the State Supreme Court on this matter
will probably be final. The water-front
attorneys on both sides admit that it is
likely that an appeal can be taken
the United States Supreme Court; if
hat is the case, it means the settlement
this suit within "possibly a year. Of
Hcourse, whichever side loses, an effort will
â be made by the losing side to appeal it to
the United Slates Supreme Court; but, as
i say, none of the attorneys Unit are
â familiar with the suit Relieve or think
â that me matter can be taken there, so that
Hthe prospect of. having the matter deter
mined within a ; year is v very v bright.
Whichever way it goes, it finally 'settles it,
Hand whichever, way it goes it is better that
should be settled than to have it hang
â iii2 on as it lias been." - â 
President Witch er of ' the Merchants'
â Exchange aiso spoke strongly against the
bill. He was followed by President Tay
â lor of the Board of Trade, Councilman
Kaufman. J. g." Wiscow. J. H. W. Solist.: â¢
Mr. Britton saw no reason why the , hill
â should not be presented. He had seen. the
water front lying year after ; year un
â improved. He was of the opinion that the
Water Front Company did not care to
â longer hold a property which is not avail
â able. It the city gets possession it cannot
â improve the property without fixing a
â very heavy tax. The State would take
â care of ii as a whole. A like work to that
â done in San Francisco would be done in
â this city under State ownership. He re
â gretted that the city's attorneys were not
â present to give the legal status of the case.
. When asKed if his views did not reflect
somewhat on the city's attorney, Mr. Brit
â toa said: "If they do, then I'll take back
â everything I have said." ' -'.-â â .[â - '
After a long discussion a resolution was
I unanimously passed, requesting Mr. Lea-
I vitt not to do anything iurth-:r with his
i bill.
As Leavitt had promised to abide by the
wishes of the merchnnts, the matter may
now be considered as closed.

PRINCIPLES OF
OUR GOVERNMENT
Rev. Father York eon the
Foundation of the
Constitution.
Its Elements Date Back as Far
as the Birth of
Christ.
An Answer to the Claim That It Is
Bui t on Protestant Doc
trines.
OAKLAND, Cal , Dec. 28.â Under the
auspices of the Catbolic Ladies' Aid So
ciety Key. P. C. Yorke lectured this even
ing at the Macdonongh Theater on the
topic, "Was the Constitution of Our Coun
try Founded on Protestant Principles?"
J. E. McElroy, on behalf of the ladies,
introduced the lecturer to the audience
and paid a high compliment to the work
of the society. In referring to the lec
turer, he said: "It has been stated that
the Catholics of Oakland are not in sym
pathy with some of the positions on
public matters taken by Father Yorke,
and I hope that you will take this oppor
tunity ot convincing him that such is not
the case and that the day of victory in
this benighted city is not far distant."
When Father Yorke arose he was
cheered for several minutes, and when si
lence was restored he said: "I am afraid,
ladies and gentlemen, that you are acting
as though you were all lined up behind
the backs of your library trustees. I have
been told that the Catholics of Oakland
feel cold shivers down their backs every
time Father Yorke comes to this side of
the bay, but 1 hardly think such is the
case.
"I am very glad to speak on behalf of
the Ladies' Aid Society, and to be able to
make use of the learned Professor Armes
and the Rev. Dr. Wendte for charitable
purposes, which 1 have no doubt is a new
experience to them and a new sensation
to Oakland to learn that the poor ever
made anything out of them. lam always
glad to "speak for the poor, but I must
confess that I feel an unholy joy on this
occasion as I have for my subjects the
learned Acmes and the Rev. Wendte."
He then' referred to the controversy over
the periodicals in the Free Library, and
reviewed the attitude o{ Professor Armes
toward it. Then he criticised Dr. Wendte,
and in doing so said:
"This subject is personal with me, as
you all no doubt remember last January
when several Protestant clergymen were
keeping me busy maintaining the dignity
and position of the Catholic church
against their falaciea, one Dr. Wendte
thought that the Protestant ministry were
not able to manage the case, so he threw
himself into the tight, stayed for a few
rounds, tolerated my bad manners and
bad English, and retired gracefully.
Dr. Wendte lives upon rights. Ev
ery month since last January he
has had one on his hands. The
next I heard of him was that he preached
a sermon in which he advocated that ii
would be a good thing to kill off all tlie
incurables. A little later tie got into a
controverHV with some brother ministers
about Martin Luther, and the other
preachers got mad because Wendte
wanted to take up too much time at their
celebration and it took them a week to
settle their differences, and then to make
matters worse, he sent in a bill to the
society which they declined to pay.
Continuing the speak r said:
When Dr. Wendte started his crusade two
weeks ago against the Catholics he certainly
proved one thine, which is, that if he knows
less about anything than he knows RDout the
Catholic church It is his knowledge* of the con
stitution, and yet tie is strivinÃ to show that
the Declaration of Independence is the flower
of those principles which Luther originated,
and that It was not founded on Protestant
doama, but on Protestant philosophy. He
also preaches that all our rights, our social
and religious systems, in fact, our civilization,
has come to us from the sixteenth century as
the result of a German revolt which made
mankind independent of the Pope of Rome.
In truth, as every educated person knows,
there is not a single stone or bean or grain of
sand in the structure upon which the Declnra
tion of Independence is built that does not go
much farther back than the sixteenth century.
The basic principle of the Declaration of Inde
pendence dates back to tae Babe of fiothlehem
and to the crib in the manger. I do not claim
that the constitution of this country is ;
founded upon Catholic principles. It \t
founded upon the universal principles that
had their birth with the Savior.
Christ did not found the church to run poii
tics; did not go slumming; did not dance in
the pulpit; did not subscribe; did not do any
of those things which characterize the evan
gelical preachers of to-day. He left on record
a saying which reads, "Render unto Csesar the
things that are Csesar's, and unto God the
things that are God's."
It is not the province of a church to run
secular affairs; it Is not her place to dictate to !
the Government or the individual, but to i
teach the great principles of morality. The '
Catholic church has ever taught obedience to ;
properly constituted power, but she does not !
say that you must cast your Government in ,
this mold or that, but yet all her doctrines ,
tend toward liberty.
When Christ and his disciples went forth
and proclaimed in the Roman empire that |
they possessed something over which the state
had no control then that empire hurled itself j
against the Christian church, and there stood i
up against it tishermen, widows and orphans
and proclaimed that no one had any power {
over them except such power came from God, !
and sooner than betray their consciences they ]
suffered at the stitke. Eventually they suc
ceeded and their religion became that'of the i
Roman empire. As the church went out and ]
taught peace nnd laid the foundation of
civilization that empire went to pieces.
Then began the reign of republics. Those
who say that the Catho.ie church does not ad
vocate and bring about liberty should look
back fifteen hundred years and they wou'd |
change their minds. In the seventh century
the reigning Pope proclaimed the great doc
trine that is embodied in our constitution,
that all governments derived their power from
the just consent of the governed. In the
eighth cenlury the Franks asked the Pope
if they had the right to depose their
King. He wrote back that the people wen
not made for the King, but the King lor the
people, and that those who make Kings can
unmake them. St. Thomas Aquinis left on
record a document in which he was asked
about rebellion; he replied that wnere gov
ernment is administered for private ends it is
the duty of tne citizens to overthrow it and
reassert their right to ghvern themselves. All
the old scholastics held the same theory that
power resides in the people and that all men
are equal, and all this went on record four or
five hundred years before the sixteenth cen
tury.
Every right possessed by a citizen to-dny
comes down from those remote ages when the
Cathollo church dominated Europe. Without
revolution the Popes of Rome won many great
battles in tne cause oi liberty and right, ami
they had none ot those kingly vices which
disgraced Europe after the reformation. The
church was already to face kings and em
perors when the rights of the people were in
vaded. Pope after Pope died out of Rome be
cause he would not betray his conscience or
the church, and in every fight the church and
the Pope were against Kings and despotism.
Now we come to the rising star of the
reformation. Let us look at Europe at that
time. Slavery had died out under the teach
ing of the Catholic church. Italy, the home
of the Pope, was divided into several little re
publics. "The Kings and Princes of France,
England, Scotland and the German states en
joyed closely limited powers. When the ref
ormation broke out no ruler was half as power
ful as he whs twenty years after the reforma
tion. At that time there wus no labor question,
and the nationalization of lands, which we

are told is the true solution of the labor
question and which thousands of people are
striving for to-day, had been almost reached.
Every town had its eo::imon lands and there
were no unemployed. All over Europe the
great monasteries provided for the poor ana
sick without charge. There â vyere no alms
houses, no paupers, no state-aided- charities.
The poor were there; they are always with us,
but they were not despised. They were tne
poor of Christ, every one our blood relatives
and all equal in the sight of God.
The lecturer concluded by contrasting
the unsettled social conditions ana the r*
li^ious controversies thaf prevail to-day,
and which he attributed mainly to the ef
fect of the reformation with the condi
tions that prevailed prior to the time of
Martin Luther. On this argument he
strove to show that under no interpreta
tion of history can it be intelligently
claimed' that the counstitution of this
country is founded on Protestant princi
ples. ______^______

WHAT THE "TOY RAILROAD"
HIS DONE TO HUNTINGTON
And What It Has Done for the People of the Rich and
Fertile San Joaquin Valley Since It
Began Operation.
COLLIS NOW FORGED TO
# CUT FARES.
An Entirely New Deal to Be
Inaugurated on the
First
SPECIAL FAST TRAINS TO RUN
TO FRESNO.
Important Changes Brought About by
the Competition of the Valley
Road,
Coll.is P. Huntington is not apparently
getting that keen enjoyment out of the
"toy railroad," as he once presumed to
call the Valley road, that he feigned to I
anticipate. On the contrary hifi experi- i
euce is much like that of the boy who [
thought to have great sport by trying to
interfere with his companion's "buzzer,"
which was provided with teeth, invisible I
during its rapid revolutions.
As a sort of Christmas gift to the people
of the San Joaquin Valley the San Fran
cisco and San Joaquin Valley Railway
made the announcement a few days be
fore the great holiday that it was about to
'engage regularly in passenger business
between San Francisco and Fresno, and
that existing Southern Pacific
rates were to be cnt in about half, and a
time schedule of greater convenience to !
the traveling public adopted.
Now, as a sort of New Year's gift, di- I
rectly due to this move on the part of the
Valley road, reduced rates of fare and
faster time on the Southern Pacific Rail
road between this City and Fresno are
announced. The new order of things goes
into effect on January 1, 1897.
On this date a special train will be put
on between San Francisco and Fresno. It J
will leave here at 4:30 p. m., and, going via
Livermore, Lathrop and Merced, will ar
rive at Fresno at 11:15 p. M., making the
run in 6 hours 45^ minutes, instead of 8
hours 15 minutes as heretoforo.
Coming this way the new train will
leave Fresno at 5:40 a. m., and, running
via Merced, Lathrop and Martinez, will
arrive in San Francisco at 11:45 a. m,,
taking but 6 hours and 5 minutes for the
trip.
At present trains leave Stockton for San
Francisco at 6:25 a. m. Under the new
schedule they will ieave at 8:35 a. m. and
arrive here one hour later than at present,
thus reducing iho time to San Francisco
by 1 hour 5 minutes. Going to Stockton,
passengers will leave at 4:30 p. m., the
same as now, but will arrive at Stockton
at 8:05 P. M. instead of 9:05 p. m., thus
saving an hour on the down trip.
For these special trains only the
Southern Pacific will inaugurate a new
deal. It will sell second-class tickets
between San Francisco and Fresno for
$3 75 as against the regular rate of $5 90,
and to Merced the fare will be $2 15 as
against the existing rate of $4 25. Fares
to intermediate points will be in propor
tion. These rates are to be the same as j
those of the Valley road to competing
points.
In this latest development, the people
of the San Joaquin Valley and of the State
at large have a most significant demon
stration of the value of a genuine com
peting line. The new road, which is but
in its incipient stage, has already saved
many thousands of dollars to the pro
ducers and merchants of the territory
through which it passes, and promises in
the near future to make its advent worth
hundreds of thousands of dollars annually
to its patrons ana also to those who, by
force of circumstances, are compelled to
take their business to the former
monopoly.
And among other things it has accom
plished, not the least is that it has forever
lifted the heavy bnrden of Southern Pa
cific oppression from the Pan Joaquin
Valley. For according to the constitution
of the State of California rates once volun
tarily reduced through competition can
not again be advanced.
By its appearance in the field the Valley
road has not only forced the Southern Pa
cific to reduce its charges on both freights
and fares in the San Joaquin Valley by
half, and therefore its revenue from its
business in that section to that extent,
but it has also taken a very large share of
the business. Under the circumstances it
is estimated that the gross revenues of
the Huntington properties in this, their
once most profitable field, has b -en cut
down to about one-quarter what they were
before the peop'e's road, the "toy rail
road." of t lie tyrant ol California, began
operation. And the end is not yet.

The wheelmen of San Francisco are to
have a benefit meet on Saturday after
noon, January 16, to raise funds to send
delegates to the National Assembly of the
League of American Wheelmen, to be held
in Albany, N. V., in February, to secure,
if possible, the passage of a law permitting
Sunday track racing in such States as de
sire itl Wishing to assist this movement
as much as possible the Garden City Cy
clers of San Jose are talking ot getting up
a similar meet, to be held on their famous
three-lap track Saturday afternoon, Janu
ary 23. They are alive to the facr that
they would be greatly benefited by the
passage of such a rule, as in fact would all
the riders, clubs and dealers in the State.
A. match race has been arranged between
Charles Jarman and D. Lloyd Conkling of
the Garden City Cyclers, to settle the
much-mooted question of which is the
faster man. It should be very exciting.
Victor A. Hancock of the membership
committee of the league in this State has
just started on a systematic tour to secure
new members for tlie division. An in
creased membership will do much toward
securing the legislation desired at the Na
tional Assembly, and in view of this fact
and of the good the league has done for
wheelmen generally in protecting their
rights and working for the cause of good
roads it is largely to the interest of every
cycler to join. Mr. Hancock will visit all
the clubÃ of this City and near-by towns,
and any individuals or small bodies of
wheelmen desiring him to call and ex
plain the benefits to be derived from a
league membership should address him at
once at 638 Market street.
Wilbur T. Knapp has gone to San Jose
on business, and Â£. E. Stoddard is visiting
Iriend* in banta Rosa.
NEW ELECTRIC LIGHTS.
Fourth, Hayes and Other Streets
Assisted in Lighting by the
Merchants' Association.
The Merchants' Association has ordered
twelve arc lights of 2000 candle-power on
Fourth street, from Market to Folsom.
They will be arranged one light about
seventy-five feet from each end of each
block and two lights at equal distances
from the lights at the intersection of the
streets. It is expected that these lights
will be installed by New Year's eve.
The Merchants' Association has also
ordered nine electric arc lights of 2000
candle-power on Hayes, between Laguna
and Franklin, arranged as follows: One
light at t c intersection of Haye.-Â» street
and each of the cross streets from Laguna
to Franklin, and two on Lamina street,
between Hayes and Grove. These lights
have been ordered installed as soon as pos
sible, so that the property-owners and
merchants along that thoroughtare can
hold a demonstration.
At the request of the Polk-street Im
provement Club, the Merchants' Associa
tion has undertaken the unexpired term
of its lighting with the Edison Light and
Power Company. The Poik-street Im
provement Club was paying $3 per week
or $12 per month for each light. The
Merchants' Association has succeeded in
having this rate reduced to $2 25 per
week or flO per month, and will thus be
able to save the Polk-street Improvement
Club the difference on its unexpired term
of six months.
MRS. SPALDING`S WILL
Contest of Her Brother and Sister Said
to Be Without Merit.
W. F. Goad and Mrs. W. S. Teris, divi
sees under the will of the late Lydia A.
Spalding, Mr. Goad being one of the ex
ecutors of the will, have filed a demurrer
and an answer to the contest recently in
stituted by Alexander Eenham and Mrs.
Helen Bush, the brother and sister of the
deceas a.
Mr. Benh&m and Mrs. Bush complain
that their sister did not bequeath to them
as great a share of the estate as they
thought thoy ought to have, ana, wishing
to annul the provisions of the will which
distributed the property among the testa
tor's most intimate ana faithful friends,
they made the usual allegations that their
sister was mentally incompetent to dis
pose of her property, and that she acted
j under undue influence.
The demurrer to this accusation is based
on the proposition that the allegations in
the contest do not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause for action, that the peti
tion is ambiguous and hypothetical, and
that it has no legal standing in court.
The answer of Mr. Goad and Mrs. Tevis
denies all the allegations of fraud, undue
influence ana incapacity on the part of
Mrs. Spalding at the time she made her
will.
Mr. Goad and Mrs. Tevis not only deny
the allegations of the contestants, but
affirmatively aver that the document in
question is actually the last will ana tes
tament of Mrs. Spalding ; that i t was prop
erly executed, signed, published and ac
knowledged by Mrs. Spalding; that the
i testator was of sound and disposing mind,
I and that the will was not procure! to be
I made by Mrs. Augusta F. Tracy, Mary P.
Marshall or any other person.
The court is asked to deny the petition
of the contestants and to enter a decree
whereby the will shall be confirmed and
be declared valid and irrevocable.
Judge Slack will hear argument on the
points at issue at an early date next
I month.
THE AERIAL BALLET
Long Legal Argument* Before United
States Circuit Judge AlcKenna.
The case of Carl E. Nilsson of the Or
pheum against Al Hayman and the man
agers of the Palmer Cox Brownies Com
pany now at the Baldwin was on agnin
yesterday before Judge McKenna in the
United States Circuit Court. The action
is for damages and an injunction to pre
vent the Brownies people from using cer
tain patented machinery and apparatus
employed in the production of what is
known as the aerial ballet.
D. Freidenrich for the Baldwin people
presented several depositions of people
who claim that the machinery that Nilsson
patented had been in use many years be
fore .Nilsson laid claim to it. â¢
J. J. Scrivner for Nilsson presented many
counter affidavits for the purpose of dis
proving the statements made by the de
ponents for the defendants. Mr. Scrivner
consumed the remainder of the day argu
ing to show why the defendants should be
permanently enjoined from using the ma
chinery of the aerial ballet. The defense
will be heard to-day.
HSYDENFELDT EXECUTORS
Judge Coffey Refuses to Remove Them.
No Money in the Estate.
Messrs. Ashton and Jacobs, the exec
utors of the will of the late Judge Hey
denfeldt, won a victory in the Probate
Court when Judge Coffey refused to make
an order removing them from their po
sitions.
Attorney Osmont contended that the
executors bad been negligent and that
they had allowed the estate to be de
vastated by reason of their unauthorized
and improvident acts, and offered figares
to show that they onght to have on uand
at this moment $200,000 belonging to the
estate.
Attorneys Meredith and Jacobs replied
by submitting records showing that all
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 29, 1596.
the money had been distributed to heirs
under various orders of the Probate Court,
with the exception of several thousand
dollars that went for attorneys' fees and
other expenses.
Judge Coffey said hÂ«. had listened care
fully to the argument of counsel, which,
by the way, extended over about fourteen
days, and at the conclusion he was not
able to see that the culpability of the ex
ecutors was any greater than it was when
he dismissed a similar application for
their removal heretofore.
The proceedings were therefore dis
missed, as an order of removal would not
he sustained on the slender record here
presented.
The application to require the executors
to give bonds was held in abeyance for
â¢ urther consideration. As they have no
assets in their possession the court could
not see clearly that the exaction of a bond
at this time wbuld be of material value to
any of the litigants.
Attorney Jacobs declared that instead
of making money out of the estate, as had
been charged, t;.e executors bad actually
lost $10,000 because of the trouble and liti
gation which their connection with the
estate had brought them.

John M. Cornish, the assistant janitor
of the building 508 California street, who
was caught Friday night suspended from

THE PRIVATES' WAR CHRISTMAS
Scene In Camp on the Kappahaunock in
1862. <
The snow still fell; the keen wind, raw
and fierce, cut to the bone. It was Gods
worst weather in God's . forlornest, . bleak
est spot of ground, that Christmas day of
'62 on thp Rappabannock, a half-mile be
low the town of Fredericksburg, says a con
tributor to Harper's Weekly. But come, ;
pick up your prostrate pluck, you shiver
ing private. Surely there is enough dr.mp
ness around without adding to it your
tears.
"Let's laugh, boys."
"Hello, Johnny I"
"Hello yourse.f, Yank 1"
"Merry Christmas, Johnny!"
"Same to you, Yank!"
"Suy, Johnny, got anything to trade?"
"Parched corn and tobacco â the size of
our Christmas, Yank."
"All right; you shall have some of our
coffee and sugar and pork. Boys, find the
boats."
To see them crowd the bank and push
and scramble to be first to seizo the boats
going into the wuter and stretching out
their long arms. Then when they pulled
the boats ashore and stood in a group over
the cargo, and to hear their exclamations:
"Hurrah for hogs!" "Say, that's not
roasted rye, but genuine cuffee. Smell it,
you uas." "And sugar, too." Then they
divided the consignment.
"Such boats? I see the children sailing
them on the small lakes in our Central
Park. Some Yankee, desperately hungry
for tobacco, invented them for trailing
with the Johnnies. They were hid away
under the banks. of the river for successive
relays of pickets.
"We got out the boats. An old hand
kerchief answered for a sail. We loaded
them with coffee, sugar and pork and set
the sail and watched them slowly creep to
the other shore. And the Johnnies?
They laughed and shouted: "Reckon
y. U uns been good to we uns this Christ
mas day, Yanks." Then they put parched
corn, tobacco, ripe persimmons, into the
boats and sent them back to us. And we
chewed the parched corn, smoked real
Virginia It-ai and Â«te persimmons, which,
if they weren't very filling, at least con
tracted our stomachs to the size of our
Christmas dinner.
And so the day passed. We shouted
"Merry Christmas, Johnny." They
shouted, "Same to you, YanK." Ana wo
forgot the bitintr wind, the chilling cold:
we forgot those men over there were our
eneraiev, whom it might be our duty to
shoot before evening.
We had bridged the river â spanned the
bloody chasm. We were brothers, not
foes, waving salutations of good will in the
nameof theÃube of Bethlehem, on Christ
mas day in '62. At the very iront of the
opposing armies the Christ child struck a
truce for vs â broke down the wall of parti
tion, became our peace. We exchanged
gifts. We shouted greetings back and
lorth. We kept Christmas and our hearts
were lighter for it, end our shivering bodies
were not quite so coll.
SHE GOT A SEAT.
Chairs Were Scarce, but She Was Pro
gressive and Secured One.
It was noon in a large quick lunch place.
A. young* woman, comely as well as self
reiiant, entered and elanced deliberately
around *n search of a vacant chair, says
the Philadelphia Press.
She saw one that appeared to be unoc
cupied, and providing herself with a cran
berry tart and a cup of coffee started to
take possession of it. .But a man's hat
was on the chair, and The owner of the
hat happened to be at her elbow with his
modest luncheon in bis hand.
"Beg pardon, but this seat is engaged,"
t:e said.
Returning to the counter the young
woman put down her tart and coffee and
started to find an empty chair. She
found one in a remote corner of the big
eating-room and, raising her hand to her
head, she putlea out a couple of hairpins
and flung her hat into the chair with a
defiant "There, that's taken !"
She then brought over her tart and
coffee and enjoyed them in the conscious
ness that she was dependent upon no
man's gallantry for the comforts of life.
IS A FAMOUS
MINING KING
L. D. Roudebush, Formerly
Owner of the Robert E.
Lee, in Town.
He and His Friends Cleared
Nearly $6,000,000 From That
Celebrated Property.
Mr. Roud-bush Also Owned the
Goden Crossâ The Mining Situa-
tion in Colorado.
L. L}. Roudebush of Denver, owner of
the Rex, Reconstruction and other mines
at Leadville and one of the foremost men
in mining circles in Colorado, is at the
Palace. Mr. Roudebush for six months
has been in bad health, owing to a drop
sical complaint.
He is forced to keep his bed here a good
part of the time. He will spend the
winter in California, staying for a time at
Santa BarDara, Coronadoand other places.
Mr. Roudebush is a famous operator in
Western mines. In the flush days of the
silver excitement at Leadville he was at the
front with some of the biggest properties
that were ever discovered in that areat
camp. He and his friends secured the
celebrated Robert J& Lee mine.
They paid $250,000 for i>, and took out
of it in all no lesÂ« than $6,000,000. The
first five weeks ihey had it they paid for
it out of the ore mined and had $25,000 to
spare. Mr. Roudebush also had many
other large mining interests then and has
had since, H:id he not been ill he
would be making big outputs from some
of his properties.
He for some time owned the noted
Golden Cross mine, on the Monave Desert,
which has lately blossomed out as a great
property.
"They are asking $1,500,000 for it now,
I believe," said Mr. Roudebush. "We
put $70,000 into it and then let it go. We
sent money out to pay its assessments,
but the man we sent it to neglected them.
"I was busy with other things and
never knew about it till afterward. It
was $10 and $12 ore that we had, though
of course we didn't have so much ot it as
is shown up there now. We had a little
10-stanip mill on the mine, bm more for
experimenting with than anything else.
, "This property is about fifteen miies
from where ex-Senator Dorsey's property
is. Mr. Dorsey got hold of a good
mine there, and sold it in England. He
is in England now."
Mr. Roudfbush says the strike at Lsad
ville is still unsettled, and that it is
necessary to maintain troops there. In
fact he says that mining coaid not go on
without them.
There is some interest in what the
newly elected Governor, Alva Adams, will
do under existing circumstances. Mr.
Roudebush says the mine-owners will
stand together and refuse to give in to the
strikers.

many prominent citizens outside of that
institution, will petition the Legislature
to amend the election laws in order to
insure fair primaries and a proper man
agement of general elections. The pri
mary election bill passed at the last ses
sion of the Legislature will be introduced.
The provisions which the Supreme Court
held to be unconstitutional will not be
embodied in the new measure. The law
was declared unconstitutional because its
application was not general, but only to
certain cities. The objections raised by
the court can be obviated without exclud
ing the desirable features of the bill. An
effort will be made in the Legislature to
secure the enactment of a law providing
for the selection of a non-partisan Board
of Election Commissioners.
Some bills relating to the management
of the Veterans' Home at Yonntvilie may
be introduced. The directors of the home
interchanged views yesterday and decided
not to obstruct any measures providing
for State control of the institution. Gov
ernor Budd has been advised that the di
rectors desire the home to be governed
and managed as a State institution. The
directors have resolved to meet the re
quirements of the Governor and Attorney-
General in all matters pertaining to the
control off the institution.
Members of ihe San Francisco delega
tion will probably resist the proposed
scheme to refer bills to a committee be
fore they have been printed. Under the
guise of economy this plan would permit
good bills to be smothered. The point is
raised that the constitution intended that
every bill should be be clearly printed, so
no mistake could be made as to what it
contained.
The introduction of a bill has come to
be regarded as the modern method oi ad
dressing a petition to the Legislature. The
printed bill comes under the observation
of newspaper correspondents and others,
and the good and bad features of the
measure are soon recognized. The system
of sending bills to a committee instead of
having them printed and placed on file
might effect a saving of money, but would
open away todefeat measures commended
by the puolic. Many members will insist
on their right to introduce bills and the
right to have the bills so introduced
printed for the benefit of their associates
in the Legislature and other constituents
at home.
Senator Eugene F. Bert will probably
introduce a bill amendatory of the fee bill
of 1895. Tbe law as it now stands is a
jumble. The proposed measure will
slightly increase and greatly equalize fees.
As an example of the incompleteness of
the existing law the fact is cited that in
the Noe case, where the County Clerfc was
compelled to issue 130 papers and index
3500 names many tinier over, no fees
could be celiected oy him, as the law did
not specify charges for dismissal of suits
or indexing of names. The bill which
Senator Bert will introduce applies to
every county in the State.
Assemblyman Waymire will reintro
ducs his measure of last session providing
for the recognition of civil service princi
ples in municipal, county and State de
partments.
Citizens of San Francisco have been
made to suffer great inconvenience and
endure the loss of time and money in
efforts to obey the laws relating to the col
lection of personal property taxes, and es
pecially on personal property unsecured
by real estate. The changes from the old
system have brought comolications in
stead of relief. The collection of taxes
eemi-annually is not in the judgment of
the Assessor and Treasurer of this City an
improvement on the old plan of paying
taxes once a year. The poor taxpayers
who were expected to be benefited get no
benefits. The new system also adds to the
expense of collecting the revenue.
Great confusion and waste of public
money result from the law parsed at tbe
last session of the Legislature, requiring
tbe Assessor to collect the taxes on per
sonal property unsecured by real estate.
It is surmised that the Supreme Court
will declare the law unconstitutional, but
the court has not decided that question.
A case is pending and a decision may be
handed down before the Legislature gets
to work amending the act.
The law actually compels the Assessor
to collect the tax before the levy has been
made. When a property-holder is over
taxed the overcharge is returned to him.
When he is not taxed to the full amount
he is taxed again.
It is estimated by Assessor Siebe that
the law has increased the annual expenses
of the Assessor's office of San Francisco at
least $20,000. In other departments there
has been a. corresponding annual increase.
Tnis law requires the Assessor to collect
the taxes on personal property unsecured
by real estate at tbe time of making the
assessment in March, April or May at the
tax rate of thÂ«Â» previous year. LasL year

the Assessor collected at the rate of $1 50
on the $100 valuation The rate fixed by
the Board of Supervisors on September of
the same year was $2 25, and every tax
payer who had paid to the Assessor was
required to pay the difference between
$1 50 and $2 25 at the office of the Tax Col
lector at the time when real estate taxes
and personal property taxes secured by
real estate became due, and payabie in
October and November ot the same year.
This year the Assessor collected at last
year's rate, $2 25 on the $100 valuation.
The rate fixed by the Boara of Supervis
ors in September was ?1 39 on the $100
valuation, and the taxpayer is presumed
to cet the difference between $2 25 and
$1 39 tome time this month. This excess
has been idle in the Treasurer's office
since April. It amounts t05172.732 20.
The Assessor contends that the Tax
Collector should collect the taxes. It is
also held to b-? unjust to make one class
of taxpayers pay their taxes in March,
when no tax rate has been fixed and when
no Board of Equalization is in session to
whom an appeal can be made from an un
just assessment, while another class, com
posed of the wealthy owners of real
estate, pay on a corrected and equalized
basis nine months later.
In the case of the London, Paris and
American Bank, which was obliged to
pay to the Assessor (it not being the owner
of real estate) the sum of $33,760 in taxes
on personal property, the showing was
remarkable. If the bank had owned real
estate it could have waited until April
and paid a delinquency of 15 per cent;
still it would havu saved $3207, allowing 8
per cent per annum lor thirteen and a half
months.
It is understood that Assessors through
out the State will resist the repeal of the
law because they are allowed 6 per cent
for the collection of personal property
taxes unsecured by real estate.
Should the Supreme Court fail to de
clare the law unconstitutional San Fran
cisco's only remedy will be to appeal to
the Legislature asking that the act be so
amended as to exempt counties of the
first class from its provisions.
This peculiar law, passed at the last ses
sion of the Legislature, was probably en
acted for the benefit of rural Assessors,
and yet it has imposed immense loss of
public revenue and great inconvenience
on tue taxpayers of San Francisco.
WOMEN TALK OF PAPERS
Christmas Social of the Pacific
Coast Press Associa
ticn
Several Interesting Statements in
Relation to Journalismâ A Sou
venir tf the Event.
There was a good attendance of mem
bers and friends of the Pacific Coast
Women's Press Association yesterday aft
ernoon in Shasta Hall, Native Sons' build
ing, it being the Christmas social meeting.
Mrs. P. T. Dickinson, the president, pre
sided.
The first number on the programme was
a vocal solo by Miss Augusta Freiaerich.
Then Mrs. Emeline U. North read a paper
on the obsolete newspaper.
She said newspapers were in vogue be
fore the flood; if not, how should we have
known about the animals that entered the
ark two by two, and what was happening
outside. She said she was of the opinion
tbe reporter was a woman, because the re
port was in plain, straightforward lan
guage, without the redundancy of the re
port of the male reporter of the present
day.
She then gave a historical review of the
papers of the past as far back as the first
newspaper of Rome and down to the pa
pers of to-day, and presented for examina
tion various papers that were published as
far back as 1800.
She also gave an interesting account of
the manner in which the newspaper men
of the past gave the news of the day to the
public, and told of many writers who have
become prominent in the literary world
and who made their debut in the obsolete
newspapers.
Miss Bertha Rickoff was to have read a
paper on "What tha Newspaper Should
Be," but she was unavoidably absent.
Miss Carrie Bowes executed a piano solo
in most pleasing style.
Mrs. Alice Kingsbury Cooley then at
some length told of "The Editor and the
Contributor," which was an amusing ac
count of a contributor's endeavors' to have
an article puolisbed, and she gave a per
sonal experience. She told her hearers
that writers must have patience, perse
verence and "band" in order to get along
in the world of literature.
Mrs. Laura Young Pinney read a paper
on "The Newspaper From the Editor's
View." She told that the editor judges
the material offered from the nature of its
fitness for the particular paper he controls
and the amount of news it contain.*. "The
articles," she said, "must fit like a French
gown." She also spoke of the beads for a
newspaper, as heads are what attract tbe
attention of the reader to an article.
Mrs.' R. A. Emmons of the Chicago
Press League war introduced, and she
stated that she has come to this City to
mafce it her home, and hoped in the
future to make herself better acquainted
with the members of the Pacific Coast
Women's Press Association.
There were a few remarks on the proper
kind of stories for children, and an ad
journment was then taken.
To each one present was presented a
very handsome Christmas souvenir, con
taining portraits and short sketches of the
officers and many of the prominent mem
bers of the association.
HIS MIND DERANGED.
A. Oilman, a Cuitonis Inspector, Locked
Up in a Cell at the Receiving
Hospital.
A. Oilman, a customs inspector, was
found wandering on Mission street at an
early hour Sunday morning by Policemen
J. F. Murphy and J. Tyrrell. As he could
not tell his name or where he lived, the
policemen sent him to the Receiving Hos
pital, where he was registered as "John
Doe."
Yesterday several friends called at the
hospital and identified him. He was at
tending to his duties on Saturday, but did
not go to his room in the Hughes house,
Third and Howard streets, that ni^'ht,
and when he did not return all Sunaay a
search was made for him and he was
found in tbe hospital.
He has for years suffered from facial
paralysis, which has now probably affected
his brain, as he seems mentally unbal
anced. He cannot collect his thoughts
and although he was able to recognize
friends who called to see him yesterday
he could not talk to them intelligently.
He is being detained at the hospital until
some one swears to a complaint against
him, so that he can be taken before the
Insanity Commissioners.
Oilman is a widower and it if said has a
grown-Up son and daughter in Switzer
land. ,
Four Case* of Diphtheria.
Diphtheria made its appearance again yes
terday after the lapse of nearly a week, and
within a few hours iour cases were reported.
They wern located as follows: 2115 Pacific
avenue, 709 Laurel avenue. 92H% Harrison
street. 704 Hayes street. This makes fifty
seven cases siuce December 1. with ten deaths.
(Change* in the Mayor's Office.
Mayor-elect Phelan announced his lutention
yesterday of making a cleau sweep of the em
ployes of the office, aud introduced Frank
Sullivan as the successor of Taylor dodgers in
the office oi secretary and Daniel Murphy as
the successor of Miss EdnaGibÃOD, the present
stenographer.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY", DECEMBER 29, 1896.
FAVORITES WIN
AT INGLESIDE
Four Winning First Choices
Saddened the Book-
Makers.
Can't Dance, at the Juicy Odds
of 12 to I, Waltzed His
Way in First.
Tommy Griffin Bid Salvable Upâ lmp.
Miss Brummel Cat Downâ Ha*
vey's Starting Was Good.
Althottgh the wind blew a half-gale and
the rain came down in torrents, the popu-
Jarity of Ingleside track was testified to
by a very fair attendance reopening day.
Before tiie bugle-call sounded for the
starters in the second, event, the
weather turned clear and though the
track was a trifle sloppy a pleasant
afternoon's sport was enjoyed. It is a
tribute to clean sport that the horses ran
very true lo form at the local track, and
yesterday was no exception, four of the
five heavily played first choices sent to
the post rewarding their backers by lead
ing the way nast the finishing post.
The day was not entirely devoid of
incident or accident. Tommy Griffin
upheld bis Eastern reputation by bidding
up Fat Dunne's Salvable, winner of the
la3t race, from $400 to $1200, and as his
own horse, Morte Fonse, finished second,
Mr. Griffin's share was fully as good a- a
winner's purse. In the second race, W.
08. Macdonough's useful mare, Imported
Miss Brumruel. which started favorite in
the betting, was cut down* after passing
the Halt pole, throngh the reckless and
careless riding, it is said, of the colored
lad, H. Brown, who had the mount on
St. sVignon.
In the big betting ring tbere was no
paucity of bookrnaking talent, twenty lay
ers of odd 3 weighing in. The firms band
ling coin were: Cook & (.'o., Stuyvesant
Club, Doyle <fc Co., Joe Rose, Elie Perles,
Golden Gate Club, Waldraan & Co.,
Hughey Jones, Joe Ullmam <fc Co., Hughes
& Co., Foxball Club, Eckert & Co., George
Rose, Union Club, J. J. O'Neil, Rosedale
Club, Ridley & Co., Brooklyn Club, Har
lan & Co. and Hoffman & Co.
Starter Dick Havey was, as usual, in
good form, sending his fields away nicely
aligned and without perceptible delay.
Gene Leigh furnished the favorite for
the first number on the programme, a
seven-furlong selling affair, in the shifty
colt Good Times, which was a consistently
supported 7to 5 favorite. He alternated
at intervals with Nonchalance in making
the pace, finally beating Ezell's youngster
out easily by one length in 1:321-2. Barney
Schreiber's mare Miss Baker was a good
third.
Ed Corrigan's Can't Dance has a pecn
liar faculty of bobbing up serenely when
least expected, and the Longfellow colt
turned the trick very neatly in the second
event, over a mile. The ring laid 10 and
12 to 1 against him, and passing St.
Aignon, the s- cond choice, in tne stretch
he beat the Montana horse a couple of
lengths in an ordinary canter. Benamela
with O'Leary up secured the show.
There's no stooping Dan Honig's Zamar
11. Carrying 97 pounds the son of St
Carlo ruled favorite over such good ones
as imp. Santa Bella, Libertine and Lucky
Dog, in the six furlongs that followed,
and taking the lead from Caspar the first
half he headed that colt past the judges
by two lengths. Lucky Dog. ridden by
Sum Doggett and 10 to 1 in the betting,
was a creditable third. Santa Bella made
a miserable showing, and was either a
"lobster" or is suffering from the die
temper, which prevalent disease has been
a source of much profit to the embalming
brigade.
Only five started in the mile and a six
teenth run, and Barney Schreibcr's colt
Schiller was an overwhelming; choice, the
books holding him at 9 to 20. Although
Flashlight was well supported at odds of
2 to 1 he made the running to the stretch
and there quit badly. The race was a gift
for the favorite, who won as he pleased
from tbe 100 to 1 shot Monita in 1:53%.
Tne mile and a furlong spin, which con
cluded tne card, was almost as good a
thing for Pat Dunn's baivable. Starting
post favorite at 7 to 5 he picked up his 101
pounds, and showing the way almost from
the jump, won very handily from Morte
Fonse, against which 50 to 1 was at one
time laid. Lovdal, the S to 5 second choice,
was a clever third. Hardtack in England,
on which a strong tip was circulated,

THE BIG STAKE EVENT.
A Crsck Field of Youngsters Will
Line Up at Inarleslde This
Afternoon.
ThÂ« rich Pominery Sec stakes over
seven furlongs, with a guaranteed value
to tbe winner of $1000, will be decided at
Ingleside this afternoon, and a cracking
good field of two-year-olds will face tbe
barrier. Howard S will no doubt be the
talent's pick, but it is more than likely
that Aquinas, Fig Leaf, Caspar and Ar
rezzo will hustle the Whistlejacfcet
youngster alone. Five other events, with
an exceptionally good lot of horses en
tered, complete one of the best cards of
the season, and a big crowd will see them
decided.
The idea of printing on the programme
opposite fractious horses the words "ba<l
actor" is a capital one ana serves as a
good guide to strangers to the track. The
plan of posting on the jockey-board the
positions ascribed eacii starter at the bar
rier also meets with the hearty approval
of bookmakers, owners and the talent in
general.
The race horses McLight, Mary S and
Captain Rees, owned by Dale & McEvoy,
will be sold at auction in the paddock at
Ingleside on Saturday next. At the same
time Gratify, Whirlwind and Detective,
the property of Jones & Coleman, will also
be knocked down to the highest bidder.
According to G. C. Fettus, the clever
writer on the New Orleann i)aily States,
"Virginia" Carroll, the bookmaker, has
turned farmer. Mr. Pettus also recites a
couple of laughable incidents in tbe
career of that eccentric layer of odds that
will bear repeating:
"A gentleman just from Virginia tell*
me that the well-known bookmaker, J. J.
Carroll, is residing on a farm near Rich
mond, Va. About as clever an operator as
ever made a book here, Carroll's eccen
tricities of temoer got him into all man
ner of scrapes. He was badly used up in
Washington two years ago by taking a
would-be backer's two-dollar bill, and
tossing it in the air with the derisive
remark, To hâlh â 1 with your Chinese
laundry ticket. Nothing less than five
here.' Of course the insulted party tackled
him and a lively scrap lollowed. But the
iunmest scrape he ever was in I witnessed
at Sheepsheau when Carroll and John
Carter bad the horse, Blue Jeans, in
partnership, it was claimed. Carroll did
not think the norse ready, and lai<l against
him in his book to lose some $2000.
"A bad man in the next book, who
thought Carroll was taking in the Blue
Jeans money for a 'bluff,' quietly backed
Ihe horse to win a snug sum. And when
Blue Jeans came out of the bunch at the
last turn and was winning easily this
neighbor of CarroU's began to 'root'
lustily for Blue Jeans at the top of his
lungs. This was too much for Carroll,
who saw himself losing $2000 by the vic
tory of his own horse, and with an ex
clamation that would not bear repetition
in print he got off his box and rushed for

TORNED ON THE GAS.
A Sailor-Boy Attempt* to Commit Sui-
cide In the Brooklyn Hotel.
A boy, about 19 years or age, dressed as
a sailor, registered at the Brooklyn Hotel
Sunday night. He gave his name as W.
Andrews and said he came from Colfax,
Plactr County.
About 7 o'clock yesterday rooming one
of the porters of the hotel learned that
gas was escaping from the room occupied
by Andrews. He broke open the door, and
found thfi boy in bed in an unconscious
condition. The gas was turned on. tbe win
dows were closed and the keyhole in the
door had been plugged with a towel, show
ins: that the boy contemplated committing
suicide.
A physician was called in, and later the
boy was taken to the Receiving Hospital.
He had not regained consciousness last
night, and his chances of recovery are

RESCUED FROM A
NIGHT OF TERROR
Three Young Girls Locked
in a Factory Build
ing.
They Screamed Until a Gallant
Young Man Stopped acd
Listened.
Carl Webb of Alameda Finally Re
leases Them and Is Over
whelmed With Thanks.
The gallantry of Carl Webb, a young
man who lives in Alameda, saved three
young girls from an uncomfortable and to
them very alarming predicament on Sat
urday night last.
Webb is employed|at tbe druggists' sun
dries establishment of F. A. Beckett, 220
Sutter street, and on Saturday evening he
started toward the femes to take a boat
for home. It was raining furiously and
be hurried along with other pedestrians
bent on escaping the pelting drops until
he had nearly reached Market street.
Here his attention was arrested by a
faint cry in a feminine voice of "Help!" and
he stopped to ascertain its sources. It
seemed to come from behind a massive
pair of iron doors opposite to where he
{ was standing, and going close up to them
he demanded:
"Who is it that wants help?"
"Oh, please, sir, get us out," said three
girlish voices in chorus. "We are locked
in and if you don't help us we shall have
to stay in all night and to-morrow."
"I'll find a policeman," said Webb,
starting away; but he was quickly
brought back by a concert of sounds from
inside that told that all three were ia
tears.
"Don't leave us," they sobbed. "We had
been screaming for an hour before any
one paid any attention to us, and if we
lose you what shall we do? Everybody
else went right by without helping us and
they will do so again."
"Well, the door is locked on this side j
and 1 have no key," said Webb, rattling!
vainly at tbe big padlock, that seemed to j
dety entrance.
"Wait a moment," called one of the |
gins; "there are some keys upstairs that
may do."
She took one of her companions for
company through tbe dark and gloomy
big Building and left the other to see that
Webb did not desert his post, which, of j
course, he had no intention of doing. 1
They returned with the keys in a few
moments, and then the problem was to
get them outside to the young fellow who
was anxious but unable to aid. The door
itself showed no orifice, but an investiga
tion by Webb of the sill beneath showed a
place where they couid be slipped out and
they were soon in his hands.
To the joy ot all concerned one of the
keys fitted the lock, in a moment the
heavy door swung open and the three
imprisoned damsels pounced on their
rescuer with many terms of thanks and
endearment. They paid no attention to
the rain that was rapidly drenching them,
but wrung his hand aud cried, and would
have kissed him had not his evident con- !
fusion at the presence of tbe entire three
kept them from adding to his embarrass
ment.
When they bad calmed down sufficiently
they explained that they worked on one
of the upper floors of the building, and
that some one on a lower floor, supposing
that all of the employes were out, locked
the doors and carried away the keys. The
girls were still thanking Webb when he
remembered that it was nearly boat time
and hurried away.
SANTA CLAUS CAME LATE.
But the San Francisco Boys' Club Asso
ciation Had a Merry Timn
Just the Same.
The San Francisco Boys' Club Associa
tion held its regular Christmas entertain*
ment at 740 Bryant street last evening.
Many of the boys' parents and friends and
invited guests were present.
At the left of the hall was the Christmas
tree, loaded down with holly berries and
candy. Leonard Everett acted as Santa
Clans.
A programme of dialogues and recita
tions, arranged by the entertainment
committee, composed of Herbert Van
Viack (chairman), Miss Florence Lund
borg and Miss Florence Paul, was carried
out with spirit, and the performers were
all heartily applauded. It was as follows:
A scene from "Julius Caesar" by John
Guinne and Charles Sullivan, "Christmas in
Camp" by the Artisans' Club ana tbe Sketch
Club, a recitation by Miss (Mara Safford, a
recitation by James Barrie, "Santa Claus iv
His Workshop" by the Hale Club.
After the programme was finished the
floor was cleared, and the drill corps, un
der the direction of Lieutenant Christian
F. Seitz, executed a series of Jancy evo
lutions. Tbe drill corps is composed of
twenty-five boys, selected from the various
clubs composing the association.
The drill corps then donned citizens'
clothes and all the boys of tbe associa
tion, to the number of 168, were each pre
sented by Santa Clans with a bunch of
holly-berries and a box of candy.
The Cosmopolis Club will give an en
tertainment at 740 Bryant street on the
evening of January 9 for tbe benefit of the
gymnasium fund. The hall is now being
refitted, and appliances and apparatus for
a gymnasium will be placed there soon.

A DOLLAR AND A DINNER
Mrs. Eugenia Schuller's Suc
cessful Experiment With
a Hat.
She Stole It From Her Husband's
Head and Returned It for
Money.
Mrs. Eugenia 3chuller, wife of Andrew
Schuller, the broker, signed a complaint
in Judge Joachimsen's court yesterday
morning charging him with an assault
with a deadly weapon.
Warrant Clerk Graham handed her the
complaint and warrant for her husband's
arrest and instructed her to swear to the
complaint before the Judge. She sud
denly changed her mind and in tbe after
noon called at Judge Campbell's court
and wanted to swear to the complaint be
fore him, preferring to have the ca.se tried j
by him. The Judge informed her that
although she swore to the complaint be
fore him the case would have to be tried
by Judge Joachimsen.
Prosecuting Attorney Quigley took her
in hand and after hearing her story ad
vised her to return this morning and
swear to a complaint charging her bus- I
band with threats to kill, as be did not [
think tbe charge of assault with a deadly
weapon would be sustained. She reluct
antly left promising to accept the Prose
cuting Attorney's advice.
"This is how it happened," she said to
Prosecuting Attorney Quigley. "I have
not been living with my husband since
November 25. but he haÃ been paying my
room rent at 532 Stockton street. 1 could
not net along witti his children.
"We have been married two years and
he is double my age. He has not treated
me well and I bear the marks on my fore
head and neck where he cut me with his
penknife. Ho never gave me any money
for clothes, although he was liberal
enough in giving money to his daughters.
'â¢On Christmas day I went to his mar
ried daughter's house on Laguna street
and waited till he came out after having
his dinner. I went up to him and told
him I wanted a dollar to get my Christ
mas dinner, and that for want of money I
had to eat a charity breakfast. I said to
him he had been feeding on turkey and
all the fine things, and 1 wanted to have
turkey also.
"We had some words and he pulled a
revolver out of his pocket and threatened
to shoot me. I saw what he was going to
do, so I grabbed his bat and ran along the
street with it. I s'.ood at a safe distance
and be sent one of the girls after me to
get his hat. I told her I would return it
if he gave me the dollar, but he must hold
up his hands so that I could see if he had
the revolver. He held up his hands and I
went back and gave him his bat on get
ting the dollar.
"He has wanted me to live in rooms
with him, but until he gives me a house
of my own and promises to treat me as a
wife should be treated I won't live with
him. I want him punished lor threaten
ing to shoot mÂ«Â«, as it will show him that
I won't be trifled with any longer."
Mrs. Schuller came into notoriety some
eight or nine months ago, when she was
arrested on a chaige of setting fire to a
bouse she owned on Oak and Lyon streets.
She was tried in the Superior Court and
was acquitted by a jury.
