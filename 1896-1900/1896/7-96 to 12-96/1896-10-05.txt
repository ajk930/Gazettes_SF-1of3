, Welcomes at Wash
ington.
Solemn Pontifical Mass Is
Celebrated by the
Cardinal.
HIS LAST OFFICIAL "WORK.
Archbishop Martinelli, His Successor,
Is Present and Is Enthusi
astically R-C.ived.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Oct. This is
the last Sunday upon which Cardinal
Satolli will officiate in any capacity in
this country, as he will leave for Rome on
Wednesday and that distinguished official
of the Catholic church celebrated solemn
pontifical mass at St. Aloysius Church this
morning. Archbishop Martinelli, who
was present, occupied a seat upon the
"throne" which was erected for his special
use as a seat of honor. The altar was ap
propriately decorated and several distin
guished priests assisted the cardinal in the
mass.
The day has been in some degree a day
of farewells to the departing and welcomes
to the coming great dignitaries of the
church. Tue last official work of the Car
dinal in connection with his late official
status as direct representative of the Pope
is shown in the following letter addressed
to-day to the Papal Secretary of State :
Apostolic Delegation, )
United states of America, >
Washington, D. C, Oct. 4, 1896. )
Your Excellency: After the Holy Father had
shown hU sovereign goodness by elevating: me
to the dignity of the Cardinalate. naturally no
great length of time could elapse before he
should recall me and name my successor in
the office of apostolic delegate.
He has named to succeed me the Illustrious
prelate, His Excellency, Monsignor Sebastian
.Martinelli, who for his distinguished qualities
of mind and for his endowment of prudence
has rightly been deemed well fitted to fill the
reqniiements of this office and to fur
nish the greatest good in the spiri
tual government of the Catholic church
in this great country, where the most
striking and noblest character is the univer
sal love of justice, charity and peace. Mon
sipaor Martinelli has now arrived, and from
this date assumes, as apostolic delegate, the
high office which the Holy Father has en
trusted to him*, with sir. the accompanying
faculties and powers.
While conveying to your Excellency this In
formation jI , most cordially fulfill - a grateful
duty by thanking your Excellency for all the
kindness you have shown me from the time of
my arrival in this country up to the present
time. I an*, sincerely grateful for air your
goodness, indulgence and co-operation in
everything which pertained to the duties of
my office.
It only remains for me to wish you health
and prosperity for many years to come in the
exercise of your episcopal ministry.
With sentiments of highest esteem and fra
ternal charity, I remain most faithfully yours,
Fe. Cardinal Satolli.
To-night at New Gonzapa College Hall,
the corner-stone of which was laid by Car
dinal Satolli, his Eminence was tendered
a farewell reception by the students, the
occasion also being the dedication of the
new hall. ;
The auditorium and gallery, which are
of spacious dimensions, were crowded to
the fullest extent, and when the Cardinal
entered, accompanied by Archbishop
Martinelli, the entire audience rose and
greeted them with applause as they passed
alonz the aisles on their way to the stage,
and when the curtain arose exhibiting a
garden scene, fortified with pots of chiys
anthemams, palms, geraniums and other
flowers, witn the Cardinal and the Arch
bishop clothed in their robes of scarlet
and dazzling jeweled insignia, surrounded
by a number of prominent Catholic clergy
men, appearing as a living center piece,
there were renewed demonstrations of
favor from the audience, at which both
the Cardinal and the Archbishop raised
their hats. ...
Grouped about them . n the stage were
several clergymen. The function, which
was altogether social in its character,
opened with addresses from the students
of Gonzaga College, all of which tended in
the direction of expressing the great re
gard felt for the Cardinal and mingling
regrets for his departure with praise and
"welcome for his successor. . And when one
of the youthful orators, bestowing his
meed of praise, alluded to greater honors
in the future that may be awaiting the
guest of the evening the Cardinal opened
wide his eyes, which had been half-closed
in meditation, and with a somewhat sad
smile, made a deprecatory gesture at the
thought.
Father Dow, who delivered the address
of the evening, made a speech which was
replete with brilliant witticisms and en
tertaining to the clergymen upon the'
stage as well as to those in the body of the
hall. Several allusions in his address
called lortn marked signs of pleasure from
the Cardinal and Archbishop Martinelli,
and at the close, Father Rooker arose
and spoke for the Cardinal, who made no
remarks himself. i

CRAZED BY EXCITEMENT.
Suicide of a Californian After He Had
Escaped Death in a Kansas
Train Disaster.
TOPEKA, Kans., Oct. 4.â Locomotive
858, attached to a Santa Fe east bound
passenger train (No. 2), exploded while
running at full speed at 4:38 o'clock this
morning near the village of Peterton,
thirty-one miles west, instantly killing
Engiueer S.runk, Fireman O. H. Hollis
ter and four tramps, injuring two other
tramp-> and frigntening a passenger so
bidiy that he committed suicide by shoot
ing himself through the head with a re
volver.
Mrs. Edna B. Maxwell was the only pas
senger injured, although the train was
heavily loaaed. C. L. Shirman ol Kansas
City, a helper in the express-car, was con
siderably bruised by failing boxes.
The man who killed himseif is said to
be William Beckler. His ticket read
"from Los Angelea to Chicago." He was
greatiy excited after the accident, and
gave his money and watch to a passenger.
He stood around where the men were dig
ging in the wreck for dead bo lies, and
cried and acted strangely, but finally re
sumed his seat in the car and became
quiet. Suddenly he drew a revolver, and,
placing the muzzle against his left temple,
fired.- He tumbled into the aisle dead,
without uttering a wo r d.
The mangled remains of the dead were
brought here this afternoon.
The ijl-fated passenger train was about
thirty minutes late. A short stop was
made at Osage City for water, and then
the engineer pulled out for a fast run to
Topeka. In a few minutes the whistle
sounded for Peterton, three miles from
Osage City. Almost immediately the
explosion occurred. The locomotive went
to pieces. Engineer fctrunk was buried
into the air and fell forty feet from the
track. Fireman Hollister was hurled
downward and crushed beneath the tender.
DIAMOND MATCH DEAL,

paper says: President O. C. Barbor of the
Diamond Match Compauy, in a circular to
stockholders which will be issued in the
next day or two, will announce as his
opinion that the $798,767 which was used
by the Moore Bros, as margins on the

account of the company was illegally
used, and that it is a claim against the
Moore Bros, which will be held against

for that amount. Mr. Wa.uer also says
the Diamond Match Company is not and
cannot be held to be implicated in any

FREDERICK COUDERT RETURNS.
Says the Venezuelan Commission Is Do
ing Much Toward Bringing About
a Settlement.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 4.-Hon. Fred
erick R. Coudert of tne Venezuelan Com
mission returned this morning aftei
nearly three months' abroad, in Paris, in
Holland, at The Hague and several weeks
at Hamburg, Germany. Coudert's trip
was made partly for recreation, but mainly
in connection with his duties relative to
the Venezuelan matter. In this connec
tion Mr. Coudert said :
"I see by the newspapers that they have
completely settled the Venezuelan com
plications, and I know every man on the
commission would be satisfied if they had
been arranged in a manner satisfactory to
all parties, but I regret to say that such ii
not the case.
"Professor Burr of Cornell has been ex
amining all the records in this controversy
and has spent two or three months in
Holland. He is a fine Dutch scholar and
has procured the history of the whole mat
ter. Pretty nrarly every document thai
exists on the subject he has seen and
studied thoroughly.
"He has also examined the records in
England. Every facility has been placed
at, the professor's command. He has
probably concluded, or very nearly con
cluded, his labors by this time, and will
be able to make a report at an early date."
Mr. Coudert said he did not know whal
the repjrt would embrace.
"While we have a general knowledge on
the subject, there are many facts to be
disclosed by the report which will be use
ful in bringing anout what we hope will
be a successful settlement."

CLEVELAND, Ohio, Oct. 4.â Details of
a gruesome tragedy in the little town of
Hinkley, in Melina County, on Saturday
have been received here. Nearly twenty
years ago there appeared in Hinkley a
stranger of whom notbing was known but
his name, which wds Bernard Sherman.
The inquisitive country folk, after a year
or more of curiosity, left the man undis
turbed in the solitude of a decrepit old
hovel which he had ren'ed in the lone
some outskirts of the hamlet.
The hut gradually became surrounded
by an air of mystery. The dweller rarely
visited the village and then only for the
necessaries of life, which he seemed to
have plenty of money to pay for.
One night in the early part of last week
several boys were silently passing the
place when they were terrified by pro
longed and blood-curdling human ravings.
The old man was never again seen alive.
Afraid of tbe scoffs of the incredulous the
boys held their silence, but the deserted
appearance of tbe old bnt finally attracted
attention and an investigation was started.
There was only one room in the house,
and when the door was broken in the old
man. was found lying dead, chained to a
uost with a locked chain. The condition
of the bouy told of a death struggle most
horrible and the doctors ascribed death to
hydrophobia.
Just outside the hovel was found the
body of a bie St. Bernard dog, the sole
companion of the recluse, the beast's
death having been caused by an ax-wound
in the head.
The supposition is that the brute went
mad and bit bis master. The old
man, realizing that death was inevitable,
had locked himself in when he felt the
madness coming on, chained himself,
locked his fetters with a padlock and
threw the Key away.
Buried under the floor of the hovel was
found $i 3,000 ip gold. There was nothing
that could shed light on the mystery of
his life. In one pocket was found an
ocean steamer check from Liverpool dated
November 9, 1874, and on the wall hung
an oil miniature of a woman and a child.
The body was given decent burial.
TYNAN STILL IN PRISON.
Unfounded Rumor of His Releaseâ Haines
and Kearney Reported Expelled
From Holland.
LONDON, Eng., Oct. 4.â The United As
sociated Presses is in a position to state
that the report circulated last night by
Reuters Telegraph Company that Patrick
J. Tynan, the alleged dynamiter, had
been released by the French authorities
and that he was on his way to tbe United
States, is absolutely without foundation.
The French officials have not yet decided
what disposition shall be made of his case.
In the meantime the prison at Boulogne
sur-Mer, where Tynan is confined, ia
closely guarded by armed police. It is
believed that nothing will be done in
Tynan's case until after the Czar leaves
France.
ROTTERDAM, Holland, Oct. 4.â The
police here refuse to give the slightest in
formation regarding the release of
Kearney and Haines, the two Americans
who were arrested here on the charge of
complicity in the Tynan dynamite plot.
There is scarcely any doubt that the two
men were expelled from the country yes
terday, but the police evidently mean to
keep secret all the circumstances of their
departure. It was stated yesterday that
iney had been escorted to the frontier, but
it is possible they were placed on board
some steamer bound for America.

LONDON, Eng., Oct. 4.â The Daily Mail
will to-morrow publish a dispatch from
Vienna confirming the report that the pow
ers have agreed upon a settlement of the
Eastern question bonorable to all parties
concerned, and amply guaranteeing the
future security 01 the Armenians. The
dispatch adds that the leading feature of
tbe agreement is the formation of a Chris
tian Zone, on the basis of the Jewish Pale
in Russia, in which security of life and
property will be assured the Armenians
by ail tbe powers, or some of them, any
necessary active operations to be under
taken by Great Britain, France and Rus
sia, and perhaps Italy.
Tbe Daily News will to-morrow publish
an interview had by its correspondent in
Geneva with Garo ana Hratch, two of tbe
leaders ot the Armenian refugees. They
give a graphic description of the recent
outbreak in Constantinople, and declare
that the revolutionary committee would
wait for perhaps a month to see whether
the powers would act; if they did not, the
committee would again write to the em
bassies asking whether they would keep
their promises. They professed to have
no knowledge of the precise lines of the
next upheaval, if such action was neces
sary, but sai'i that it would be terrible.
They repudiated any animosity against
the Turkish nation, saying that they
warred only against the Government.
When it was proposed last August to set
fire to Constantinople they had nesatived
the proposal because it would have been
cruel. They bad supported the plan to
attack the Imperial Ottoman Bank in
preference to doing anything that would
cause suffer iner to the residents of Con
stantinople. They added that they would
not hesitate to kill soldiers and policemen,
but would not injure peaceable people.
Tbe Government ,they significantly said,
might reflect on the scheme for burning
Constantinople; that it might|bave been
more easily effected than the attack on
tbe bank.
The Constantinople correspondent of the
Chronicle telegraphs that the Ottoman
Bank and the representative of the Credit
Lvonnaise are sending away large quanti
ties of securities. It is stated that the
latter forwarded 1,000,000 francs worth of
securities to Paris a few days aeo. â¢

ously that it was abandoned. In its plare
the Democrats proposed to allow ttie Pop

to vote for Bryan and Sewall. This sub
stitute was rejected by the Populists by a
vote of two to two, one member beintr ab

the fusion fell through.
TOM WAT NON'S READI WRATH.
Would Suffer Deenpitation Jtnthtr Than
Makti Way far Setenll.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. s.â An Atlan
ta, Ga., special says: "I'd lay my head on
the block before I'd retire from the
ticket to make way for a pluto
crat, a bondholder, a National banker
and a protectionist like Mr. Sewall,"
â¢aid Tom Watson last night. "If Mr. Sew
all is willing to get off the ticket I believe
that even now there is a chance to elect
Mr. Bryan," said Mr. Watson. "Mr.
Bryan and I could at once make a tour to
gether and inside of ten days we might
restore thousands of votes.
"I will remain on the ticket till the last
ballot is cast," exclaimed Mr, Watson.
"When the election is over I will go back
to my party, and they will know then that
the trust committed into my hands has
not been betrayed.
"I have been snamefully treated, but I
am not afratd to do my duty. I represent
a great pol tical party and was regularly
nominated for the office of Vice- President
by my party in National convention.
ThinE of how I have ben used.
"Think of the humiliation of having to
beg in public for a formal notification of
my nomination. Think of tbe indignity
of being asked to abandon the cause of
my party fora fellow like Sewall.
: 'Xo, I will not retire. I intend to vote
for Mr. Bryan and do all in my power to
elect him, but I want to warn the free
silver Democrats of the country that, they
cannot hope to secure enough votes from
the people to eltct Mr. Bryan by reviling
and deriding their candidate.
"I represent men who pray before they
fight, men who have no lust for office,
men who have sacrificed everything for
principle and have withstood every mis
representation and ostracism for con
science sake. You ennnot laugh down a
cause for which 1,800,000 have cast their
votes.
"These men are beginning to realize
that their party has been sold out. It has
been fused away. fJnless they are treated
fairly and respectfully by tue free-sitver
Democrats thousands of men will stay
away from the polls in November.
"Already the Populist papers which are
indorsing fusion in the West are losing
circulation, and those which are fighting
it are gaining circulation. Senator Butler's
papÂ°r is losing rapidly, so is Senator
Stewart's Silver Knight, bin the populist
editors in Georgia, Missouri, Texas, Indi
ana, Kansas and other States who are op
posing the surrender of the Populist party
to the Democrats, are increasing their
c.rculation. That tells the story."
DEMOCRATS DEMAND ALL.
Their Selfishness May Defeat Fusion in
Ttco Mates.
WASHINGTON, D. C. Oct. 4.â Populist
Chairman Butler does not think that
fusion will be defeated in Indiana. He
Bays the conditions there are different
from any other State except West Vir
ginia. Both the National committees
have urged all the State leaders, where
fusion was desirable, to steer clear of all
alliances concerning Congressmen and
State candidates untii the arrangement of
the electoral slate.
Chairman Butler, in almost every State
except Indiana and "West Virginia, has
found the Populists eager to fuse on Con
gressmen and State nominees. But in In
diana and West Virginia, he says, the
Democrats have tried to force fusion of
the State and Congressional nominees
upon the Populists as a condition of fusion
on the electoral ticket.
Both he and Chairman Jones have la
bored with the leaders in Indiana. The
Populists there, in compliance with ad
vice from the National Committee, have
agreed to an electoral ticket of ten Demo
crats and five Populists.
Chairman Bntler says that the ticket
will stand as far as the Populists are con
cerned. Should the Democrats refuse to
pull down five of their electors, which lie
regards as improbable, the Populists will
simply vote for the ten Democrats, and if
Bryan loses the other five in November
the blame will rest upon tbe Democrats.
The situation in West Virginia, he says,
is about tbe same. The Populists have
certified to two electors of their own
party. They refuse all overtures for fusion
on the State ticket and intend to persist
in it.

I have the honor of acknowledging the re

policy which unites the supporters of free sil

A Barbarous Custom Is Broken

Many Years.
JAILS FILLED WITH FARMERS.
Their Crops Are Rotting in the Fi Ids
and Utter Ruin Seems to
Confront Th?m.
f( opyrfght,lÃ96,by tbe United Associated Presses]
BERLIN, Girmany, Oct. 4.â The Bava
rian haberfeldtreiben, a sort of lynch
law organization, has had a sudden and
unexpected check. It will be remembered
that it was an ancient custom, said to have
dated back to Charlemagne, traditionally
set in motion after the close of the harvest
season with a view of settling old scores
with obnoxious persons in the rural dis
tricts. In the olden times it was a sort of
rough justice and served its purpose. Of
late years, especially since the spread of
socialism among the rural population of
upper Bavaria, it has degenerated into a
riotous and moonlighting custom, by
which people were shot, cattle maimed
and property burned. During a quarrel a
fen* nights ago a former victim of the
haberfeldtreiban denounced the Burgo-
master of Saulach as a "babermeister."
The Burgomaster p/omptly arrested the
man for having insulted him in his offi
cial capacity, and the efforts of hisfrieuds
to obtain his refetst have been unsuccess
ful, the Burgomaster having demanded
tbe sum of 8000 marks bail for his libera
tion. At that time 2500 men had been ar
rested in the Holzkirchen, Tolz ana
Schiierse districts under the charge of
belonging to the haberfeldtreiben.
The excitement in the localities men
tioned Is intense in consequence of the un
expected action of the authorities. The
crops, which before now ought to have
been gathered, are rotting in the fields on
account of tbe owners and laborers be
longing to the farms who are confined in
prison. This state of affairs means seri
ous loss and probably total ruin to hun
dreds of farmers and others. .The Bava
rian officials have for a long time sought
to apprehend this particular class of
offenders, but up to this time have not
met with any success. In the latter part
of October, 1895, a mob of 250 haberfeld
ers, all of them with blackened faces and
otherwise disguised, met in an open field
opposite the railway station in Sauerlick
one Sunday and held a meeting, at which
they elected officers. Some individual
present asked the station-mr\ r< r if he
thought he had not better u-. ..j.lifor
assistance to drive the crowd a w ay. The
station-master thought the suggestion a
good one and endeavored to put it in
force, but found that the telegraph wires
had been tampered with so thkt communi
cation with other stations was completely
cut off. Tbe meeting finally broke up
and the matter rested.
The next night 500 haberfelders assem
bled and Held a grand court in Strohning,
a short distance away. The assistant
forester at Hafolding and the Postmaster
at Sauerlich were designated as culprits
and a posse was sent out to hale them be
fore the court. The condemned men were
dragged from their beds and brought be
fore their self-constituted judges who read
a long indictment to them reciting their
sins. In the meantime the presence of
the haberfelders had become known far
and wide and the inhabitants of the out
lying villages arose froratnier beds and
hastened in the direction of the scene, but
they were awaited by the mob. The
gendarmes in the district were totally un
aware of the meeting and not a single
haberfelder was ever idenitfied. The au
thorities, with the intention of pun
ishing the inhabitants of the vil
lage invaded by the mob for their
cowardice, quartered a company of
soldiers among them, whom they had to
support for the next six weeks. The au
thorities tried in everyway to get the
ringleaders of the haberfelders into their
clutches, but their victims feared to inform
upon them and they were consequently
never apprehended. Now they have been
brought up with a round tarn and it is
safe to assume that they will be severely
dealt with.
WANT THE CAMPAIGN NEWS.
All Europe Eanerly Hatching the Politi
cal Conflict in Jlii* Country.
BERLIN, Gkbmact, Oct. 4.â The action
of tbe Berlin Tageblattin contracting with
the United Associated Presses for the
special American service of that organiza
tion, which is now being delivered daily
to a large number of European journals,
is significant of the interest which is taken
on the continent in the political prospect
in the United States. The bourses, which
are chief among those interested in watch
ing the progress of the campaign in
America, are looking forward eagerly to
more definite indications of the out
come of the election than the
estimates of boards of rival politi
cal parties have hitherto supplied. The
commercial community, despite their an
tipathy to tbe tariff views held by Mr.
McKinley, are hoping for the triumph of
the "sound money" or gold party, while
the asgrarians, on the other hand, pro
fess to regard Candidate Bryan as a sort
of savior, and rejoice in the utterances of
Prince Bismarck in his recent letter to
Governor CuJberson of Texas, which tbey
believe must have a tendency to materially
influence the situation.
The Berlin representative of the United
Associated Presses learns that the German
Government fully expects that the United
States will institute a system of reprisals
against Germany immediately after the
election, no matter what might be the re
sult thereof.
Prussia* TO LAUD.

BERLIN, Germany. Oct. 4.â The Polish
National movement is again causing con
siderable anxiety to the Government, al
though nothing or a serious nature is sup
posed to be imminent; but there is
abundant evidence that the continued ef
forts of the Government to Germanize
Prussian Poland have met with a? very
small degree of success. The national
spirit in that territory is very Btrone," and
it is being fostered by the Roman Catholic
clergy. Many instances of boycotting and
otherwise ] annoying German : settlers â  are
reported, and these show that the feeling
of discontent is widespread. On the oc
casion of the recent visit of Archbishop
Strablewzki to Spalenitza the populace
became greatly excited, and in the height
of their fury * administered a severe maul-

President Faure and High Officials
Assemble to Greet the
Russian.
PARIS, France, Oct. 4.â The city is
filled with visitors from the provinces who
expect to take part in the fete in honor of
the Czar. Forty thousand people are
walking the streets to-night, having been
unable to secure accommodations. The
omnibuses and cars have been literally
packed with humanity, and hundreds of
people are standing along the streets
waiting patiently to find some means of
conveyance. A majority of those desir
ing to get about the city are compelled to
walk. The cab and carriage drivers are
taking advantage of the great influx of
visitors and are charging fancy prices for
the use of their vehicles, little attention
being paid to the established tariff.
This, however, does not cause much
fault-finding, as the crowd is a holiday
one and speuds its money freely.
President Faure has gone in state to
Cherbourg to await the coming of tbe
Czar. He is accompanied by the president
of the Senate; the president of the Cham
ber of Deputies; Baron de Mohrenheim.the
Russian Embassador to France; Count
Lannes de Montebello, French Embassa

morrow afternoon.

the Queen at Balmoral. Everything was
in readiness here for their departure for
Cherbourg, and a fine diplay of flags,
etc., was made in honor of the brief visit
of their Majesties. A large detachment of

WASHINGTON, Oct. 4.-Bishop John
J. Keane, rector 8f the Catholic Univer
sity of America, â¢ located here, has re
signed at tbe request of Pope Leo XIII.
The news, which became public here to
day in an unauthorized and somewhat
erratic form, was entirely unexpected and
caused much comment in Catholic circles.
Bishop Keane this afternoon made pub
lic the official correspondence so that the
Bishop John J. Keane.
facts should be properly understood. He
accompanied it with the following state
ment:.
Since my withdrawal from the rectorship of
the Catholic University of America will prob
ably be regarded by a certain portion of the
American public us a matter of some interest
to them, and since unauthorized btatements
are apt to be misleading, I deem It my duty to
state briefly and clearly the facts in the case.
On September 20 I received through his Em
inence, M-r. Satolli, a letter from our Holy
Father, Leo XIII, of which the following is a
translation: < V .
To our Venerabl* Brother, John Joseph Keane,
Bishop of 4fÂ«io-VESKHABiK Bbothek: Health
and apostolic benediction. Jt Is customary that
they who are appointed to preside over Catholic
universities should not hold tbe office in perpe
tuity. >. This custom has grown np through wise
reasons, and the Roman Pontiffs have ever been
careful that it should be adhered to. Since, there
fore, venerable brother, you have now presided for
â  several years over the university at Washington,
In the first establishment and subsequent develop
ment of which you have shown laudable zeal and
diligence, it has seemed best that the above
mentioned custom should not be departed from
and tbat another representative, whose name Is to
be proposed to ns by the Bishops, should be ap
pointed to succeed you in this honorable position.
In order, however, that in your resignation of
this office due regard may be bad to your per
sonality and your dignity we have determined to
elevato you to the rank ; of Archbishop. Being
solicitous for your future welfare we I leave it to
your free choice either to remain in yonr country
or, If you prefer it, to come to Rome. If you choose
the former, we will destine for you some archi
epiÂ»copal see by vote Of the Bishops of the United !
States. If you prefer the latter we shall welcome j
you mo lovingly, and will place yon among the ;
consultors of the Congregation of Studies and the
Congregation of the Propaganda, in both of which
you could do much for the Interests of religion in
tbe United States. In the latter case we also as
sign you a suitable revenue for your honorable
maintenance. . .
.Confidently, trusting, venerable brother, that
you will accept this, our administrative act, with
hearty good will we most lovingly bestow yon the
anostollc benediction as a pledge of oar paternal
affection. ; . ;, -. , ;

while I always regarded its duties as a labor
of love, they had grown to be far beyond my
strength and ability, and deliverance from the
burden is a response to my prayers. I was too
. loyal a soldier to ask to be relieved from my
post no matter what its difficulties; but feeling
: that my nine years of strain and solicitude in
the work has brought me close ito the end of
my brain and nerve powers. I was fully ready
to welcome what has been doije.
I shall now. enjoy some mouths of. greatly
needed rest on the Pacific Coast, leaving all
plans for tho future to a later date. Of course
no one needs to be assured that ,the action of the
Holy Father is prompted not only by personal
kindness toward myself, but also by earnest
solicitude for the best interests of the univer
ity. He believes in "rotation in office," as all
sensible men must. He \ knows > the - evils of
allowing any official, especially the head of a
university, to fossilize at h! s post, and in this
all must acknowledge his wisdom. His en
lightened prudence, and that of the trustees
who have to present the nominations, will be
sure to select a rector - in : every way fitted to
guide the work to fuller and fullest success.
From the peaceful retirement which I trust
I have somewhat earned I shall ever watch Its
progress with unabated interest. And I ap
peal to all whom my efforts In behalf of this
university have ever reached to continue their
Interests and their zeal in this new change for
the good of the university and to make it what
by right it must be. the , crowning j glory of

SAFETY PLEDGED
TO ARMENIANS
f Continued from I%rU Paoe.\
Turkey sees in what direction such massa
cres lead. Constantinople is now in a se
rious economic crisis.
Baton yon Saurma-Jeltsch concludes by
â¢
declaring that he has strongly warned thÂ«
Sultan that such a state of affairs as he
sets forth in the interview cannot con
tinue, and that he must be careful to
strike only those who are guilty of plot
ting against him.
GERMANY AND TURKEY.
The Sultan Expresses His Gratitude for
the Kaiser's Support.
BERLIN, Germany, Oct. 4.â There is a
growing disposition here to regard the
solution of tbe Turkish question as being
on the eve of completion by an amicable
agreement among the great powers, and
it is taken for granted that all likelihood
of the partition of Turkey in the near fu
ture has vanished. The semi-official press
make much of the supposed influence
which Baron Saurma yon Jeltsch, the
German Embassador to Turkey, exercises
over the Sultan, which the papers ascribe
to the Turkish monarch's coifviction that
the representative of Germany at Con
stantinople is not actuated by selfish aims.
The papers also connect with this pre
sumed feeling on the part of the Sultan
the reported departure from Constanti
nople for Berlin of General Grumbkof, a
German officer in the Ottoman service, as
the bearer of an autograph letter from
the Sultan to the Kaiser. It is stated that
the communication expresses the Sul
tan's gratitude at tbe attitude assumed
by Germany in the Turkish crisis, and
ascribes the troubles in Turkey to revolu
tionary agitators.
The Sultan also, according to report,
assures, the Kaiser that the Christians in
Turkey will be absolutely safeguarded un
less they engage in anarchistic excesses.
The Altdeutsche Blatter prints an amaz
ing scheme of a story for the division
of Turkey, claiming the whole of Asiatic
Turkey for Germany, adding that Ger
many may possibly allow the Sultan to
remain under a German protectorate, as
suming the direction and administration
only of affairs of the Tigris and Euphrates
Valley.
THE PORTE TO BULGARIA.
Unemployed Armenians Must Be Ex
pelled- Front That. Country.
LONDON, Eng., Oct. 4.â The Constanti
nople representative of the U. A. P. tele
graphs that the Porte will require the
Bulgarian Government to expel all unem
ployed Armenians from that country. The
request will be based on the ground that
these idle Armenians assemble in the
cafes of the large towns of Bulgaria and
conspire against the Sultan. M. Dimitroff,
the Bulgarian diplomatic agent at Con
stantinople, has protested against the pro
posed action of the Turkish Government.
The correspondent further says that
serious disturbances occurred at the Yildiz
Kiosk (the Sultan's residence) on Thurs
day. Twenty sottas (theological students)
decided to obtain an audience of the
Sultan. Upon their request beirg refused
they attempted to force themselves into
the presence of his Majesty. The troops
who were on duty prevented their en
trance, but in so doing killed three of the
softas. The others were arrested.
MODERN "CHURCHIANITY"
Rev. Mr. Ford of the First
Christian Church Favors
a Change.
He Advocates Sunday Picnics and
Excursionsâ The Sabbath a Day
of Recreation.
Rev. Frank S. Ford, pastor of the First
Christian Church, on Twelfth street,
preached last evening on "Modern Phari
saism, or Churchianity."
"It was with some fear that I ap
proached this subject, which 1 might call a
fad of mine," he said. "But I talked with
some of the brethren and sisters, and
tbey told me that was just the kind of
religion they wanted. lam not afraid of
having heterodox hurled at my head
so long as I have them with me.
"Do we have any phansaism to-day?
Yea, verily; lots of it. We don't have to
go outside of San Francisco to find it, nor
out of the Eleventh Ward. We are not
wrapt in our Christianity but in our
churchianity â following some creed and
wandering away into a cold, formal reli
gion.
"It is a fact that these pews are not filled
by the people who should be here.
Churches were not made for the righteous,
but for the unrighteous. 1 will tell you
the secret, my friend; we have simply
gone to seed on formalism. There is no
such thing as a Babbath; that is going
back to Judaism. The Sabbath is a day
of recreation and should be so observed.
We should keep our bodies pure and un
defiled because they are the temples of the
soul.
"Now, I do believe that there are cer
tain physical conditions which make it a
sin for a man to go to church. It has
been demonstrated that the vitality of a
man who works seven continuous days Is
far below that of the man who has one
day of rest. That is one reason why I ad
vocate Sunday picnics.
"Now, for instance, il we could ju3t ad
vertise in the Saturday papers that this
church would give a Sunday picnic to
some of the islands in the bay. It must
also be understood that there would be
Sunday-school on board and preaching
say at 11 and 4 o'clock. Now don't you
know that this kind of religion is practical ?
"Instead of baptizing one a month, I
would baptize at least 1000. Let us open
our churches day and night, where people
can seek recreation from the turmoil of
the City. Look at tbe Catholic churches.
They are open all the time. We might
differ from the Catholics in many things,
but we can't differ from them when it
comes to feeding the hungry and clothing
the naked."

CARSON'S TURF SCANDAL,
Another Sponge Removed From
the Nostril of the Horse
Drummer.
Horrible Suffering of the Animal
Before Relievedâ Thuggery
at Reno.
CARSON, Nev., Oct. 4.â The plugging of
the nostrils of racehorses with sponges
yesterday is still the sensation of Carson.
The owners of Drummer were up all night
with the horse, which suffered terribly
from the swelling and inflammation. At
one time Thompson & O'Keefe thought
they would lose the horse, but about noon
to-day a second sponge was extracted, ana
the animal will probably recover. Those
who â¢ Itnessed the agony of the horse be
fore the obstruction was removed say that
they would be glad of a chance to hang the
miscreant who did the plugging.
Alliance and Vanity seem all right to
day, as the sponges were removed soon
after they were inserted, but the owner of
Vanity thinks another small ?ponÂ«e is still
in the horse's nose. He suspected jobbery
in the morning and removed tbe horse
from tbe track to a livery-stable, where it
was guarded. One of the watchers went
to lunch and left no one in his place, and
at this time, the owner believes, the plug
ging was done.
Todhunter, the fast half-mile horse
which last winter in a five-furlong race at
the Bay District reached the half-mile post
in :46%, is supposed to have been doped
at Reno at the State Fair race. He went
in the five-furlong dash on Thursday last
and headed Susie D a length to the half,
vfrtually running her off her feet, but on
Saturday the same horse went to the post
apparently asleep and came floundering
over the course like a cow, running last.
Owners of horses that lost race- in Keno
note that for several days after tbev came
from the fair their animals stood halt
asleep in their stalls, without enough life
in them to brush the flies away. Hypoder
mic injections of morphine are supposed
to have done the work. The secretary is
striving hard to ferret out the real offend
ers and will offer $500 reward. There are
several suspected persons in town, one of
whom plugged Drummer before, and an
other who was run out of Portland for
dosing a horse, and at another time at
Woodland caused his employer to lose
$5000 on a race by dosing the horse he had
tue care of.
SANTA CRUZ'S CHAMPIONS.
Electrics Win _ tint Honor* in Coast
Baseball Circles'.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Oct. 4.â The base
ball match between the Oakland team and
the Electrics of Santa Cruz resulted in a
victory for the home team by a score of
14 to 'I. The excellent pitching of Ed
Daubenbiss, whose work was of the pro
fessional order, was a feature of the game.
The Oakland boys could not connect with
his south-paw shoots. Only two hits were
made off his delivery, af.d twelve men
were struck out by him. The result of
to-day's game makes Manager Ely's ag
gregation the champion baseball club on
tbe coast, it having beaten every club with
which it has played and lost but ten games
out of fifty- two.
Baseball at Stockton.
STOCKTON, Cal., Oct. 4.â There w.ts a
lively game of baseball here to-day be
tween the Will & Fincks of San Francisco
and the Stockton baseball team. For a
time tbe game looked as though it would
be a gift to the visitors, but at a critical
moment, when tde bases were full, Pace
of Stockton lined out a two-bageer and
brought three men home. Lochbead, the
local pitcher, also knocked out a three
base hit and sent three of the Stockton
team over the rubber, winning the game.
Babe White of Stockton did some star
fielding, making three brilliant running
catches. Score:
Stocktons 0 0 2 0 0 114 6-1*

AT SAN JOSE
Lively Competition for the
Target Association
Trophies.
First Honors in the Team Match
Won by Olympic Club
Marksmen.
M'COY TAKES THE "GOLD DUST."
The Tournament Declared the Most
Successful Ever Held in
America-
SAN JOSE, Cal., Oct. 4.â The first day
of the San Jose meet of the California In
animate Target Association was pro
nounced by visiting marksmen by far the
most successful in the association's his
tory. In tlie number of entries it even
eclipsed the celebrated meeting of trap
shooters in Rochester, N. V., in 1895,
which was at the time pronounced the
largest ever held in the world. There
were 163 entries for all the events, and the
marksmen kept the five electric traps busy
from 8 o'clock this morning until it was
too dark to see the bluerocks thi?
evening.
The average shooting was poor, but the
Olympic Gun Club of San Francisco did
some phenomenal work and broke 108 blue
rocks out of a possible 120. This entitles
this club to the Overland Monthly trophy â
a silver punch- bowl. The Lincoln Gun
Club of Oakland took second place in the
team event, breaking 103 bluerocks out of
a possible 120. In the third event, for the
E. T. Allen cup, individual contest, Dr.
W. S. George of Antioch proved the victor,
making the only clean score in the event â
twenty birds straight.
The second event was for the "Gold
Dust" diamond medal. Martinez Chick
of the Los Angeles team and R. H. McCoy
of the Stockton Athletic Association both
made clean scores of 20 each in this con
test, and the tie was shot off. The match
proved very interesting, as the contest
ants have tied each other on several occa
sions. Chick missed his last bird, and
McCoy won the medal by a score of 17 to
Chick's 16. There was great rejoicing in
the tent of the Stockton marksmen over
this victory.
The team shoots for the Overland
Monthly trophy resulted as follows:

BROWNS MOUNTAIN ABLAZE.
Great Pines Mowed Down by a Wall of
Flamesâ Mount Lowe Hotels in
Danger.
PASADENA, Cal., Oct. 4. â Browns
Mountain, crowned by great tongues of
flames that shot along its top, was the
sight that greeted Pasadena people this
afternoon.
Director Royce of the Pasadena Water
Com-pany, who nas just come in from
the camp of the fire-fighters, says the
flames were thirty feet high, and have
mowed down the great pines as a sickle
cuts grass, leavins tbe once beautiful spot
a blackened and charred wilderness.
This is the mountain upon which Owen
and Jason Brown cherished the fond hope
of erecting a great observatory to the
memory of their noted father, John
Brown, of Harper's Ferry fame.
Like scores of other beautiful spots in
the Sierra Madre range it now stands a
scorched and blackened monument of what
Scout Burnham characterizes as criminal
carelessness.
Scout Burnham has recently returned
to Pasauena from the scenes of his cele
brated exploits in the Matabele war, and
he is very indignant at the apattiy of the
people in allowing thousands of acres of
mountain land to be devastated before
they take action.
Royce reports a strip thirty miles long
burned over. The men had a close call
for their lives last night. They were sur
rounded by fire, and after an exhausting
night's work bad just three loaves of
bread for nineteen men, with the camp
eight miles away.
A huge fire is now burning in Bear Can
yon and a larger one in San Gabriel Can
yon, northeast of Pasadena.
The greatest apprehension is again felt
for the safety of the Echo Mountain
House, Alpine Tavern and other property
of the Mount Lowe Company, thoueh they
were yesterday believed to be outside the
danger line.
People, with their belongings, are com
ing down to the valleys below. Alarm
riders are keeping far in advance of the
flames, warning the few settlers and bee
keepers of the impendine dancer.
'The conflagration covers a strip twenty
five miles long and from one to six miles
wide.
Machinery is gradually superseding
horse traction on the Paris tramways.
Already there are steam trams by tlie side
of the Seine from the Louvre to Versailles,
and from the Arc de Tnomphe to various
points, while mechanical traction, either
by steam or electricity, is in contempla
tion on other lines.

STRIKING AT THE COMBINE.
Senator White's Political Partner
D clar d a Foe of Sound
Government.
Lob Angeles Office of the Call,)
328 South Broadway, >
Los Angeles, Cal., Oct. 4. )
The following letter wa3 sent to the
chairman of the Democratic State Central
Committee to-day:
To the Chairman of the Democratic State Central
Committeeâ Sir: A political party has no ex
cuse for Us existence unless it unalterably
stands for the principles it would apply to the
government of society; and no true Democrat
will tamely surrender his political principles
by voting for the socialists and riff-raft .poli
ticians who pander to the antagonistic doc
trines of foreign socialism. The sincere Demo
crat must be a Democrat from principle. He
believes that local self-government is the
foundation of all free government. He insists
that the State, the community and the citizen
have certain fundamental rights which can
not be given up without endangering the
liberties of the people. He believes that the
highest aim of government should be to re
strain every man from doing any injury to his
fellow-man and to guarantee every person in
the enjoyment of the fruits of his own labor.
These principles underlie the political creed of
every true Democrat. They are the test by
which he must govern his fidelity to the can
didacy of those who seek to exercise the func
tions of the Government in which his life,
liberty and property are involved.
The citizen is no longer a Democrat who
unites with or supports the votaries of an
tagonistic doctrines; and when he votes for
the devotees of foreign socialism, who demand
government ownership of all the means of
production and distribution, he delegates
power to men who insist on a scheme of gov
ernment that would deny a man the fruits of
his own labor by taking from the industrious
to support, the drones of society.
No Democrat, true to his own principles of
government, can have anything of a political
nature to do with any man or set of men who
secretly or publicly demand an antagonistic
scheme of government, or who urge principles
that would plunge our Government into an
archy and destroy the Republic. The men of
the People's party, so called, who support
Thomas V. Cator for United States Senator are
devotees of the most dangerous form of foreign
socialism. He has in the past been their
aggressive leader, and experience has proven
that they will support no man who does not
accord with their political views. They reside
usually In the larger cities ot the State and
Nation, are active and determined partisans,
but, being conscious of their weak political
strength, they unite with the People's party ;
and, by denying their real convictions, clan
destinely teach their dangerous doctrines to
the rank and file of the sympathetic organiza
tion. The elevation of their leader to the
Senate of the United States would discredit the
intelligence of our people, disgrace the State
and humiliate the Democrats who aid in his
election.
Were our countrymen endowed with human
perfectabllity we would require no Govern
ment and then we would be scientific anar
chists, without a Government, and enjoying
the millennium indeed. But as the Creator has
not given us the kc-y to omniscience nor en
dowed uÂ« with human perfectability, we must
have Government among men, and we cannot
preserve our free institutions nor maintain a
republican form of government by pandering
to tha dangers of foreign socialism. There is
no middle ground between the American
Democrat who supports William J. Bryan on
the one hand and the disciples of foreign so
cialism on the other; therefore, the al
leged Populist leader in this campaign is a
dangerous impostor covertly bargaining for
office and posing as a secrit defender of an
archy on the one side and tue duty he owes to
his country on tl c other.
We want no reign of terror, no anarchy, no
foreign socialism, no crowned head, nor
moneyed oligarchy. We want the rights of
every citizen, every community and every
State guaranteed under an American system
of government in all respects free from foreign
control. But we cannot have such a govern
ment if we elect legitlators w ho pander to the
fallacies of foreign socialism, And who, to con
summate their designs on society, trade in mi
sters of justice for contral of the law-making
power.
We want a Democratic government once
again. We want a free, united and prosper
ous people under the democracy given Us by
Jefferson, preserved by Lincoln, defended by
Bryan and forever to be perpetuated Dy the
Democratic party, and this we cannot have
by intrusting the functions of government to
such men as Thomas V. Cator. The sincere
Democrat can never lower the banner of his
democracy to the red flag of the commune
that has a logical defender in the alleged Popu
list now seeking to be elected to the United
States Senate by Democratic votes. Therefore,
urged by an unalterable lealty to Democratic
principles and appealing to our fellow-Demo
crats to 8a ye their party from humiliation and
disgrace, the provisional committee for re
organization of the Los Angeles democracy
urge every Democrat in California to require
each legislative candidate he may at the com
ing election vote for to subscribe to the pledge
contained in the following resolution:
Whebeas, One Thomas V. Cator Is a Popu
list candidate for United States Senator; and
whereas, said Thomas V. Cator is claiming that
for United States Senator he will receive the
votes of Democrats elected to tne Thirty
second California Legislature, notwithstand
ing the fact that said Thomas V. Cator does
not claim to be a Democrat; therefore be it
Resolved, That every Democrat in California
be and he is hereby urged to require each
legislative candidate he may at the coming
election vote for to subscribe to the following
pledge: "I hereby pledge myself if elected to
the Thirty-second California Legislature to
cout.cnously vote in the joint assembly thereof
fora L'Tmocrat for United States Senator, and
I will not vote in said joint assembly for
Thomas V. Cator. Alva Udell,

BRYAN'S ENMITY TO WHITE.
Ihe Senator Said to Have Intuited the
i 011 tin Xebratkan.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Oct. 4.â Senator
Wnite : s absence on a pleasure trip with
friends to the Grand Canyon of the Colo
rado at a time when his party is sorely in
need of orators to spread its doctrines in
California has caused considerable com
ment among local Democrats.
"White was never known to take a trip
like this when his own immediate inter
ests wore at stake," is the substance of
wnat can be heard in almost any group of
political debaters.
This pleasure trip of Senator White's
recalls some of his statements about his
doubts respecting his own State in this
contest, which has been in striking con
trast to the claims of Congressman Ma
gll ire and nearly every other stump
speaker of the party this year.
Moreover, it is now remembered with
some emphasis that White has been re
markably lukewarm as to Bryan's candi
dacy throughout the campaign. He
"found it out of the question" as chair
man of notification committ ee to "go into
the enemy's country" and inform Mr.
Bryan of his nomination at Chicago.
There is a story abroad which explains
all of these things. It is this: Senator
White was a member of the credentials
committee at the Chicago Convention.
The National Committee had indorsed and
seated the opposition to Bryan's delega
tion from Nebraska during the temporary
organization.
After the committees had been appointed,
Bryan began his memorable fight before
that committee in behalf of himself and
his colleagues. He had repeated occasion
to see Senator White and other members
of the committee. On one of his visits to
the committee-room Mr. Bryan sent in his
name several times, as the story goes, to
see the California Senator.
Mr. White, evidently sympathizing with
Bryan's opponents, did not care to see the
Nebraskan. But Bryan waited without
and watched his opportunity. Finally
White appeared at the threshold and the
"boy orator" attempted to speak with
him. White tried to parry off the silver
champion and finally shut the door in his
face, never dreaming that this beardless
youth was soon to be "his" candidate for
the presidency.
White, it is understood, incurred the
bitter enmity of Bryan by the door-slam
ming episode, hence his indifference to all
else in this campaign except his combine
with T. V. Cator to control two sessions
of the California Legislature.
BEN BUTTERWORTH ARRIVES.
ii ill Begin Hit California Campaign at
san Bernardino To-Day.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Oct. 4. â Hon.
Benjamin Butterworth of Ohio, one of
the ablest orators in the Republican
ranks, arrived here this afternoon direct
from Nevada.
Mr. Butterworth comes to California
under the management of the National
Republican Committee, and will make a
number of speeches iv the State.
His first speech in Southern California"
will be delivered in San Bernar
dino to-morrow evening. On Tuesday
evening he speaks at San Diego,
Wednesday afternoon at Santa Ana,
Wednesday evening in this city, Thurs
day evening at Ventura, Friday evening
at Fresno, and thence he goes to San

Jar. Butterworth has been speaking for
some weeks in South Dakota and Minne

were assuredly safe for McKinley and
Hobart.
PORTLAND'S POLICE CHIEF OUT.
John W. Minto Resigns to Forestall Re
moval Because He Would Mot
Support Bryan.
PORTLAND, Ok., Oct. 4.â Chief of Po
lice John W. Minto, by far the best ex
ecutive head of the police department this
city ever had, steps out of office to-mor
row to make room for one of Mayor Pen
noyer's favorites. Minto resigned, know
ing that his removal was a question of a
few months only, because of his pro
nounced opposition to Bryanism, and also
to enable him to eifect an organization of
the policemen heretofore removed by Pen
noyer to work for the Republican Presi
dential nominees. The old Chief retires
with a splendid record for honesty and
ability, and his going is greatly deplored
in the community.
His successor is a wealthy patron of the
turf, known as "Doc" Robertson. Robert
son is very friendly toward the sporting
fraternity, with which he has been on the
most intimate terms for many years, and
in consequence an early clash is expected
between himself and District Attorney
Lord. The latter is making a strong cru
sade against the gamblers.
The Police Commissioners meet to-mor
row night, and they will likely remove
Republican policemen.

Celebration.
First Passenger Train Over the
Competing Railroad Will
Arrive To-Day.
GEEETING TO CLAUS SPRECKELS
A Boisterous Welcome Awaits the
Founder of the Lineâ A Parade
and Barbecue.
FRESNO, Cal., Oct 4.â The arrival of
the first passenger train over the Valley
road will be celebrated in grand style in
Fresno to-morrow. It will be the most
elaborate affair ever planned in the San
Joaquin Valley, and a fitting recognition
of the greatest enterprise promoted on be
half of the people in this part of the State.
Fresno realizes the import of the ar
riyal of the first train over a competing
railroad, and to-morrow will show her ap
preciation of what has been done for her.
The reception to Claus Spreckels and
the other directors of the Valley road will
be a gladsome one when they arrive on
the train, and they certainly will appreci
ate the happiness of the people which they
were instrumental in causing.
The preparations for the celebration
have been going on with vigor for the past
week, and the various committees are
gratified at having their labors practically
completed by last evening.
The arrangements for the big parade
were under the management of Fulton G.
Berry, and it will be a grand success. It
will be the most extensive parade ever
held in the City. Governor James H.
Budd, accompanied by his staff, will be
Commander-in-chief.
General Matthew W. M tiller of the Third
Brigade N. G. C. with his staff and Lieu
tenant Colonel S. S. Wright with staff of
the Third Infantry Regiment, will partici
pate. The Ninth Battalion N. G. C, con
sisting of companies H of Merced, Eof
Visalia, C and F of Fresno will be in line.
The floats in the parade will be numer
ous and magnificent. Nearly every busi
ness house in the city will be represented.
A striking feature will be the display of
Clovis Cole, the largest grain-grower in
the valley, who will have in line six
twelve-mule teams and eighteen wagons
loaded with wheat from his ranch, to be
shipped over the new road.
The procession will start at noon, and,
after passing through the principal streets
of the city, wiil proceed to the depot
grounds to receive the train, which will
arrive at 1 o'clock. Besides the excursion
ists from the north the train will bring
about fourteen directors and trustees di
the railroad company.
Arthur R. Brigcs will deliver an address
of welcome and Mr. Spreckels is expected
to respond.
After short speeches by prominent citi
zens of Fresno the barbecue will begin.
Arrangements have been made to feed 6000
people.
The roasting of the carcasses over the
pits began at 10 o'clock to-night. Many
rows of tables have been constructed, ad
joining the roasting pits. The barbecue
will be free to everybody.
The day's festivities will conclude with a
bicycle parade in the evening.
The wheels will be gorgeously decorated,
spirited competition being induced by the
offering of several valuable prizes. A.bout
400 cyclers will be in line, and they will be
in charge of Emery Donanoo, assisted by
Harry W. Skinner as chief aid.
In tbe"tevening there will also be a ban
quet at the Hughes Hotel, given by the
Chamber of Commerce and the Hundred
Thousand Club in honor of the- Valley
road officials and otner prominent guests.
Preparations for it have been made on an
elaborate scale.

of people from various parts of the valley
to attend the celebration. Nearly every
town between Stockton and Bakersfield is

SAW THE FIRST ENGINE START.
Thomas Wilkinson, Who Witnessed the Trial
of a Locomotive in 1821, Will Be a
Guest of Fresno.
SELMA, Cal., Oct. 4.â At the opening
of the Valley Railroad to-morrow at
Fresno there will be present Thomas Wil
kinson of Clifton, five miles north of this
place, a native of Darlington, England,
where as a child he saw the first crude lo
comotive (the one that was on exhibition
at the World's Fair at Chicago), make its
trial trip seventy-five years ago this
month.
Subsequently Thomas Wilkinson was
indentured to the Shildon works, where
the Stephenson's first railway locomotives
were built. Mr. Wilkinson still has his
indentures and they are probably the old
est papers of tne kind in existence. He
also has probably the oldest pass in ex
istence. It reads:
Office of Stockton and Darlington Railway.
Thomas Wilkinson to ride by coach or coal
train to Middlesbro.
Shildon Works, Sept. 4, 1845. Wm. BoCCH.
That pass carried the holder over the
first railway ever built and operated in
the world as a commercial line. Com
menting on it, the Newcastle (Eng.) Daily
Chronicle recently said:
In those days Shildon was a more important
center thau it now is, for at it the bulk of the
engines of the Stockton and Darlington Rail
way were built and repaired, and of that im
portant work Mr. William Bouch, brottier, we
believe, of the late sir Thomas Bouch, was tho
head. It will be noticed that the pass gives
permission to travel aliice by passenger train
or by coal train. It wus issued at a time when
the length of the Stockton and Darlington was
about forty miles; when that, Important work,
the Sheldon tunnel, had noi, been long opened
and when the line from Middlesborough to
Redcar was in course of construction.
Mr. Wilkinson would lie at Shildon under
the supervision first, probably, of Mr. Timothy
Hackworth, who was the first in charse of the
locomotive engines under Mr. John Dixon, the
consulting engineer. Mr. \Villiam Bouch was
later at the head of the Shlldou works, and
with Mr. (now Sir) David Dale he projected the
larsrer works at North road, Darlington, to
which from their opening, thirty-three years
ago, much of the locomotive-building was
transierred from Shildon. But this was long
alter Mr. Thomus Wilkinson had left England
for America.
The Stephensons, Ilackworths and Bouches â
all names connected with the opening of the
vast system of railways that had here their
modest beginningâ have passed away, and
even many of their pupils ; others, like the en
gineer we have named in California, have
lound homes and work in distant lauds.
Mr. Wilkinson has been a citizen of this
country nearly forty years and is now a
farmer in Fresno County. The latest rail
way,' as the English have it, is surveyed
through his land in its extension from
Fresno to Reedley.
Mr. Wilkinson is a hale and vigorous
man of nearly eighty years, all the early
part of his life having been st>ent in loco
motive building. He is now enjoying the
English ideal â a country home.

SAN JOSE, Cal., Oct. 4.â The Sarsfield
Club of this city at a largely attended
meeting this afternoon took steps toward
holding an entertainment to raise funds
to aid the Irish, political prisoners recently
released from Portland prison and to
work for the release of other political pris

TO AID ABUSED
COMPATRIOTS
The Knights of Tara Hold
Their Second Annual
Picnic.
Proceeds to Swell the Fund for
the Benefit of Irish
Prisoners.
THE DAY A GREAT SUCCESS.
An Attractive Programme and Prize
Listâ Music by the Hibernian
Military Band.
It was perfect holiday weather yesterday
and the Irish population took advantage
of that circumstance to flock in crowds to
the second grand annual national picnic
and reunion held at Shell Mound Park
under tbe auspices of the Knights of Tara.
The latter, who form a flourishing local
organization of some two years' standing,
received able assistance from their coun- 1
trymen belonging to the Knichts of the
Red Branch, the K. R. B. Kifles and tne >
. Wolfe Tone Club of Oakland.
The picnic and reunion yesterday had
a distinctly patriotic object In view, i
ulterior to and even more important than i
that of mere personal enjoyment. The I
cash proceeds will be specially devoted to j
the fund for the benefit of the Irish pris
oners recently released from English dun
geons.
The enthusiasm inseparable from a
worthy cause always seems to be conta- j
gious, and it is therefore not surprising j
that several of the prize-winners yesterday
should contribute their money to the fund |
in question. Both Miss May Donaghue and j
Tim Murphy, champion lady and gentle- j
man jig and reel dancers of the day, volun
teered to make this sacrifice or the good
of the cause, and their generosity was re- j
warded by the plaudits of the multitude.
The programme of sports was most en
joyable. There were special races for the j
Knights of Tara, the Knights of the Red j
Branch and the Wolfe Tone Club, tbougn
the most interesting sporting features of
the afternoon were "first *mi foremost â
view of the Irist man's proverbial gal
lantry and love of beautyâ the ladies'
races," and next after those a one-mile
bicycle race.
in the last named Clarence Newman, a
young rider, came in fast, a good half-lap
or more ahead, with A. Pluschkell second.
The third starter tried to steal the pole
from Pluschkell and earned a fall thereby,
but escaped injury.
The list of gate prizes was unusually
comprehensive in character, and included
numerous attractive objects in kind |
which were occasionally out of place when
the winner chanced to be of tender years.
The music for tne dancing and the sports
was furnis ed by the Hibernian military
band, and was in keeping with the occa- j
sion. The. committees in charge yester
day were as follows:

FAVORS THE CHURCH.
Dr. Dllle Non-Partlsan, but Advo
cates Placlnjr the Government
In Good Hands.
In a prelude to his evening discourse
last night Rev. E. R. Dille spoke on the
necessity of placing the municipal gov
ernment in the hands of honest men. He
said among otter things:
â¢â¢We need men that will not give the
streets to corporations through a corrupt
bargain, but who will conduct the City's
business on the same principle as direc
tors conduct the business of t.'ie corpora
tions with which they are entrusted.
"When directors of corporations meet
for the transaction of business they do not
brtng their politics to bear on how ttey
.â¢-hould vote, and it should be the same
with the City officials.
"The municipalities of Edinburgh, Lon
don and Birmingham are not governed by
the national politics. In London there
are 12S Councilmen, including lords, earls
and commoners, and no man can tell from
their actions to which political party they
belong. As a conseauence, Birmingham
pays GO cents a thousand for gas and has
water at the lowest possible price.' 1
In conclusion the speaker held that the
affairs of San Francisco ought to De ad
ministered on purely business principle?,
ana that such a 'course would be tbe
prayer of every true patriot.
A FISHY FIGHT.
Fierce Battle Between a Sealion and a
Shark in the Bay Yesterday.
Yesterday morning R. Crowley, JT. J.
O'Neil, H. Leech and Charles Barry, mem
bers of the Pioneer Rowing Club, were out
in their boat off the sugar refinery when
they witnessed a strange conflict. It was
a fierce and bloody battle between a sea
lion and a shark. This unusual specta
cle attracted the young men and they
drew as near the aquatic fighters as they
dared.
The two sea creatures fought savajrely,
plunging at each other and olten bound
ing high in the air in their struggles. It
was a full grown sealion and the shark
appeared to be about ten or twelve feet
lone. The foaming water around was
dyed red and the seal appeared to be get
ting tne better of the watery argument.
Finally the combatants disappeared, the
shark apparently withdrawing from the
contest.
CASE TO FATHER YORKE
He Advises the Chancellor to
Disband the Young Men's
Institute.
The Catho'ic C ergvman R primanded
for Asking Cipt -in Taylor
lor a PI dge.
Rev. Dr. Case devoted himself to a dis
cussion of Rev. Father Yorke at the How
ard-street Methodist Church last night, in
cidentally dwelling on what he termed
"the pernicious influence of the Roman
Catholic church on American politics."
He began by snying t: at the American
Protective Association hÂ«d done much to
secure liberty in American politics. "A
few years apo," he said, "and only a little
while before the American Protective As
sociation, 1 saw a ticket containing thirty
six names and thirty-two of them were
Roman Catholics. In the face of this
Chancellor Yorke has the effrontery to tell
us that the Pope and his priests take no
hand in American politics.
"Why, the Roman Catholic church is
nothing but a political machine. It never
saves souls. Pope Pias, the man tbat had
been made an earthly god, had masses
said for the release of bis soul out of pur
eatory. Archbishop Hughes, wLo has
been dead for quite a number of years,
has masses said for bringing bis soul out
of that place that is 99 degrees hotter than
hell.
"Yes, the hat is being passed around
annually for tbe collection of money for
the release of those men's souls. Their
church Is a begging institution.
"In Washington the Sistersâ but I must
not speak of those ii'dies disrespectfullyâ
go around the ' Inces collecting from the
clerks on the l^t of every month.
"Father Yoike says he regrets the pres
ence of tbe A. P. A. 's. I dare say he does, â¢
'â¢ and so does tne Pope, because the associa- i
tion has put an estoppel on the work of
the Roman church and made tbe Catho- i
lies loyal.
"You don't see tbe green rag hoisted
above the Stars ard Stripes now, but you i
would see it only for the presence of the
A. P. A.'s,
'â¢The Chancellor wants peace, does he?
Well, I will tell him how he can procure
peace.
"Let him disband the Y. M. L, that so
ciety tbat bas its red hand in politics do
in, the bidding of the church.
"The Chancellor says it is enough to
damn the A. P. A.'s because Traynor, its
r resident, kept a whisky shop in Canada. \
If this be so what is to become of the
Catholics? Didn't Buckley keep a saloon
and isn't tie a Catholic?
"Who is this man who represents the
old man on the Tiber that dare ask Cap
tain C. L. Taylor, the nominee for Mayor,
forapledge? Who is be that sinks tue
County Clerk into perdition because tie
conducts bis office as it suits himself,
without a king the man from Rome whom
he should put into his office ? Who is
this man that damns George Eiiier be
cause be does cot belong to his chnrch?
Elder wishes to be let alone, but Yorke
won't let him alone.
"This Chancellor wants the Komtn lion
and tne Protestant lamb to lie down in
peace together. But if ever that recoa
ciialion takes place the lamb will be in
?! Ie of the iion. \orkewoutd make us
Delieve that the only men who fought and
died for this country were Catholics. We
admit tbat tbe Ca holies fought and we
know tbat they would fight to-morrow ir
this country was in trouble. But this iseasiy
accounted fur. It is because they be:ieve
in their blind superstition that they will
own the country some day, and as a con
sequence they think they* would be fight
ing for their own. But thanks to tbe A.
P. A.'a they have set the progress of Rome
back a hundred years, and this is the
reason tbat the priests don't like the
American Protective Association.''
In conclusion the speaker advised all
wno are cot Roman Catholics to join
Protestant church, saying: "It is the
Protestant churches that the Catholic
priests dread. All the infidels and atheists
on earth cannot successfully war against
the church. It is the organized Protestant
churches that have driven the tyrannical
church to the wali, an 1 it is the organized
Protestant cburcnes that will keep it from
obtaining control of this blessed land of
oars."

companies of San Francisco, consisting of
the Eintracht shooting section, Captain
Fred A. Kuhls; the San Francisco Turner

At least 345 men were in line beaded by
Marshals William Garms Jr. and John
Lankenau and a band. At the ferry the
riflemen met their families and friends
and the next boat and train carried hun
reds to tbe park. There each amused
himself or herself according to fancy.
It is easy to state where the men with
th- target rifles went, for in a very short

YOUNG PARKHURST DEAD
The Berkeley Evangelist's Mys
terious End at West
port.
Hs Family Fears That There Ha
Been Foul P.ay, and Will
Investigate It.
BERKELEY, Cal., Oct. 4.â A cloud of
mystery surrounds the death of Webster
H. Parkhurst, the youthlul student, ath
lete and evangelist, who expired suddenly
at Westi'ort, Mendicino County, yester
day morning.
Not a vestige of information bas been
received by his family in Berkeley, up to
a late hour to-night, relating to the cau-e
of young Parknurst's sudden and wholly
unexpected demise. Three telegrams
were received to-day, however, from F. S.
Adams, witn whom the young man was
associated, but no,, a word was stated as to
the conditions whicn surrounded his
death.
As a consequence the family fear that
something in the nature of foul play bas
taken place. What strengthens this be
lief is the fact that tbe captain of the
"Webster H. Parkhurst.
Noyo, which left - Fort Bragg yesterday,
refused to take the body aboard for trans
portation because it was not accompanied
with a physician's certificate.
An officer of the boat stated this after
noon that he understood from parties
living in Fort Bragg that Parkhurst was
taken sick on Friday ; that a p.iysician
was called and gave him a prescription;
that be died twenty-four hours later and
that the physician refused to is^ue a cer
tificate of death. This is all the informa
tion which the Parkhorst family have at
hand.
hen the young man left Berkeley last
June he was considered a fine type of
physical manhood and was without any
constitutional ailment whatever. That be
should be taken ill and die within twenty
four hours has arouÂ«ed the deepest anxiety
and suspicion throughout Berkeley. What
is still more s : range is the fact that Rev.
Mr. Adams, with whom Parkhurst had
been traveling, though having sent all
four telegrams, has failed to give a clew
to the cause of the su den death. Tele
gram after telegram asking what caused
the young man's death have been sent,
but all to no purpose. '
A friend of the family will leave to-mor
row morning for the scene of young Pare
hurst's death with the view 10 determin
ing how the young man i appened to die
so suddenly and to bring his remains back
to Berkeley.
During a series of camp meetings about
a year ago he was converted, together with
a fellow-student named George Payzant.
These two young men subsequently cre
ated considerable of a sensation because of
their announcement that the millennium
was at hand. Pa burst afterward * left
school, having decided to give his. life to
the work of saving souls. His peculiar
actions at this time elicited: much com
ment throughout the community. Last
June.' though a mere boy. be lelt Berke
ley and assum-d the â¢ role of an evan
gelist. - He has been r traveling â¢ through
the State ever Â«mc* in company with Rev.
Mr. Adams. The last letter received from
him by his mother was written about
three weeks ago, and at that time every
thing looked well : for the young man.
Nothing more was beard until yesterday,
when word came of his death.

IROQUOIS BRAVES
EAT BULLSHEADS
A Great but a Degenerate
Feast and "Time" at
San Leandro.
How the Glory of the Bullshead
Has Departed With the
O.d Missions.
DEMOCRACY UNDER THE VIBE.
Thres Hundred Feop c, S xteen Savory
Heads and Fcur Speeches Make
Things Pleasant.
The Iroquois Club held its annual bulls
head breakiast at Ban Leandro yesterday
afternoon, and it was one of the greatest
Iroquois Club events in all history; but
alas for the degeneracy of bullshead
feasts !
Bollshead "breakfasts" are no longer
what they u-e i to be, when in the good
o.d days of the Spanish dominion we used
to gather from a hundred miles about to
the silvery music ol saddle trappings, in
stead of the whir-r-r and thump, thump
of electric cars, and when a bullshead
breakfast was no Shell Mound picnic.
This affair of yesterday was degenerate
with all iis glory, and bo are all the rest
of the bulisheaii breakfasts of these parts
nowadays. Tbero's more breakfast than
bullshead abont them ail. In the neigh
borhood of San Francisco they are peter
ing oat at the rate of abont four a year,
and the Iroquois Club is helping reduce
them to the ignoble plane of six-bit
French dinners.
A bull's bead is a noble thing when its
massive form has teen slowly blackened
for a day and a night by the buried bed of
fire and when it overlaps the edges of the
biggest platter in all the country with its
juicy jowls awaiting, the carver's knife.
It is more worthy of glorious bailing at
the feast than was ever boar's head in old
England.
They knew this a generation or two ago
in California, and when on the second
day the time for the feast had come, the
company vould gather about the big hot
mound of earth and the speaker of the day
would pronounce a glowing oration before
the . steaming earth was i ceremoniously
removed. Then when the massive morsels
were exhumed, they became the feast, and
all else was < trimmings. There was a
sturdy reality about a bullahead breakfast
then. .
They are too clean and finicky now, and
the builsnead is one of the entrees. They
used to sew each big head in a gunny sack
and when the great bed of coals was right
and the beads were laid thereon they
would hone-tly shovel the dirt on top of
them and heap the grave as for all time.
Then when the exhuming came in the
presence of the hungry and joy:ul multi
tude the hot and heavy gunnysacks would
yield another load of confining clay with
each cleansing thump, and when they
were ripped open the savory mother earth
would mate a sweeter smell and the pic
nic gory would be over it alt. Â«
Well, they'll be cooking bulls' heads in
French ranges next, like a mere roast of
beef. Down there at San Leandro Land
lord Godchaux went out near the
chicken-coop on Saturday and dug a grave
with {geometrical precision. A bed of
coals two feet deep was made right . and
sixteen unwrapped bulls'*beads were laid
in a row therein, nose to horn.
Over the grave was laid an iron roof and
the earth was heaped above. The heads
lay in an oven and all was clean and like
a Frenchman's art. No Spanish don
could have cooked them better, but the
way and the glory of the old builsbead
breakfast seemed vanished with .c mis
sions. . <:â¢â 
Three hundred people enjoyed the affair
and it was all a : complex delight. The
crowd was a merry one ann half the peo
ple were ladies. Few October Sabbaths
have been more delightfully warm and
lovely amid the orchards, gardens and
flowers of San Leandro and the crowded
electric cars gave a panorama of beauty
between Oakland and this country town.
At 1:30 P. m those who came to the feast
surrounded many long tables invitingly
spread in an immense grape arbor in the
hotel gardens, and great purple clusters
helped the woven foliage shadow ; the
fruits, wines, napery and substantial good
things which crowded the tables.
: The people seemed to appreciate all this
as an improvement' on the old style buli~
bead breakfast, and the pity of the style
| made no shadow on the feast. They ate
; beans and then sliced tongue and things,
| and then the Ã¼bllsheads meat came on in
platters sliced into generous . bits. They
were : ju.cy and delicious morsels.
One should be worthy of such a dish,
but none doubted themselves. Then
there was served lamb . cooked on spits
and chicken cooked on a stove, and there
were other things to eat at the good
dinner. -Â:.â '.- . â ."..-. -â¢â .... .... -.-. .-. â  .- â¢â â â .-
Just once was the real builsbead served
in all its glory. A perspiring I waiter bore
one :on a great platter to the \ bead of a
table where - "Con" Sullivan â  sat. ;â¢ The
thing looked' fierce and \ picturesque and
grand, and oh! very, good. . Â
The blackened : ears crumpled a' little,
the stagginess,was> gone from the great
forehead, and the big quiet nostrils seemed
to disdain the carver from the edge of the
big platter. A bull's bead on a table is a
gnt worth seeing. 5 "Con" wasn't born
in Sonora, bat then . ' â "â 
The rest of the affair consisted of peo
ple, sociability and politics. Charles Gil
dea, president of the Iroquois Club, ably
and tactfully bossed it all in a general
way and , presided at ; the formalities. . He
was > helped \by the officers of the " club,
who always run the club affairs.
Louis Metzger, chairman of the board
of trustees, asked questions all the time.
Dr. W. J. Bryan was so busy he didn't

quite well, saying that on this occasion
the Democrat and tne Populist were one ;
that he was inspired with the spirit of

true Democracy.
J. C. B. Hebbard spoke briefly, J. J.

CRICKET CLUB GAMES.
The Bohemian and Alameda Eleven*
" Came Oat the Conquerors.
Of the two cup cricket matches played
yesterday that between the leading team,
the ' Bohemians, and . the s second in the
race, the Pacifies, was the ; more interest
ing. It was played at Golden Gate ana
result d in a victory for the Bohemians by
a dozen runs. ..
Winning the toss Captain Robertson
of the Â Bohemians elected to bat.
Both made double figures before
they were retired, an example sub
sequently followed by Bowhill, Pollock
andAitken. That the fide was last dis
missed for the comparatively modest total
of 114 was mainly due to Harbour's bowl
ine and general smart fielding.
When the Pacifies took their turn at the
bat they nad well- based hopes of surpass
ing this score. But these batsmen dis
posed of, the ti : c turned, and half a dozen
wickets succumbed to the deadly breakers
of Robertson. Then Dickinson and John
Theobald made a plucky stand and raised
the score to a point of interest. When the
latter lost his leg stump, however, the end
was in s'ght, and the result above stated
was soon arrived at. The score :

BRYAH'S CHANCES
Sees a Sign in the South
Portentous of His
Defeat.
He Never Can Be Elected With
the "Solid South" Broken
and Against Him.
ADVANCES IRREFUTABLE LOGIC
The Colonel Hurls Anathemas at the
Windy Leader and Calls Him
a Revolutionist.
"My opinion is that Delaware, Mary
land, West Virginia and Kentucky are
just as safe for McKinley as any of the
Northern States, and in old Virginia Mc-
Kinley lias an equal show with Bryan of
carrying the State."
These were the words used yesterday by
Colonel John S. Mosby. who is in close
tuuch wiih the political situation in the
South through the medium of a volumin
our correspondence with old-lime friends
in that section of the country.
Realizing the Colonel's influence among
the people of his native State he was asked
by the Republican National Committee to
canvass old Virginia during the present
campaign, but owing to the fact that he
â¢ has only just recovered from a three
months' illness, the ex-Confederate sol
dier felt compelled to decline the invita
tion. He has, however, taken a deep in
terest in the campaign in the fouth, and
particularly in Virginia and Kentucky,
and has aided the Republican leaders
ihere with suggestions and the party by
contributions to the press of these States
in the interest of McKinley, protection,
patriotism and prosperity.
"There is the hottest campaign going on
in C\d Virginia," said the ex-Confederate
cavalry leader, '.'of any State in the
Union. A considerable number of leading
â â¢' Democratic papers have come out against
Bryan. Then in all the commercial cen
ters, like Richmond, Norfolk, Danville,
Lynchburg and Alexandria, great oppo
sition to the free coinage of silver has
been developed. The professors in the
colleges of the State have declared apainst
free silver. The professors of the Univer
sity oi Virginia have come out against
Bryan and free silver.
"A i the recent gold convention at Rich
mond one of the delegates was Professor
Thornton of the University of Virginia, a
nephew of James D. Thornton of San
Francisco, formerly one of the Justices'of
the Supreme Court of California, who by
the way is a Democrat but opposed to free
silver.
"A great many leading men of Vir
ginia," continued the Colonel, "are now
canvassing that State agamst Bryan and
free silver, who have never voted any
thing but a Democratic ticket in their
lives. The president of the Sound Money
.League in Ricnmond is William Wirt
Henry, a grandson of Patrick Henry.
List week he made a speech in Richmond
against Bryan and free silver, and about
the same time General Buckner addressed
a large meeting there on behalf of the
gold standard. The president of the meet
ing was General Pnvton Wise, a brother
of Collector John Wise of San Francisco.
Buckner was introduced by Governor
O'Ferrall, an old-line Democrat, who
came out strongly in favor of free silver
and against the anarchistic platform
adopted at Chicago.
"I see that General Benjamin Harrison j
is to speak in Richmond in a day or two.
The very fact that a man of his promi
nence is sent to Virginia shows the strong
hopes the Republicans have of carrying
the State, for they would not waste their
ammunition on a State they had no hope
of carrying.
"I have a number of correspondents in
Kentucky, and I am assure;! by them that
Kentucky is as safe for McKinley as Ver
mont.
"If McKinley loses Virginia it will be
because he is counted out in th<* negro :
counties where they always perpetrate the j
great irauds.
"I noticed in the papers that Colonel
Charies Marshall, who is at the head of
the Baltimore bar, and who was on the
staff of General Robert E. Lee during the
war, has come out against Bryan and free
silver. This indicates the urift of the
sentiment, of the old Confederates.
"Mr. Cleveland's friends in Virginia are
nearly all against Bryan and the Chicago
platform, including the office-holders. All
of the Virginia cities will no overw elm
ingly against Bryan. With a lair election, |
McKinley will carry the State by 30,000 1
majority.
"There was a convention in Richmond
la3t week of Democratic lawyers who op- i
posed Bryan. The object of the meeting j
was to device means to prevent McKinley I
from being counted out. The Republicans !
hope that the organization of this powerful |
body will secure a fair election, as their
white allies will protect the ballots and
tee that there is a fair count."
"There are five Democratic United
Stales Senators," he continued, "openly
opposing Bryan's selection : Gray of Dela
ware; Vilas* of Wisconsin; Caffrey of
Louisiana, who was president of the In
dianapolis convention; Lindsay of Ken
tucky is on the stump against Bryan;
Hill of New York is sulking in his tent
he withdrew in disgust from the anarch- j
ist convention at Chicago, declaring: 'I
am a Democrat, but not a revolutionist.'
Next week Secretary Carlisle begins his
tour of speaking in Kentucky. You must
remember that last year the Republicans
carried both Kentucky and Maryland â
Kentucky and Maryland now have Re
publican Governors. Bryan can't be
elected without the 'Solid South.' That is
now broken."
"By the by, do you know who coined
the phrase 'a solid Sauth'? Well, I did.
It first appeared in a letter of mine ad
dressed to a Confederate in favor of the
election of Hayes, which was published in
the New York HÂ«rald August 12, 1876, and
atterward issued in pamphlet form by the
Republican Congressional Committee.
Here is the pamnhlet," said the colonel.
"1 will give you an extract from i* : 'Be
sides, you say that iPTilden is elected he
will be under the control of the Confede
rates. If that is so, then you will have no
need of me. But suppose Hayes is elected
with a solid South against him, what are
you going to do then? You do not see
now, but you will then see the force of my
logic. 1 By this 1 meaut that in the event
of Hayes' election the Southern people
would be glad to utilize the influence" of
any Confederate soldier who had sup
ported him. In other words that it would
be better for the Southern people not to
put all their eggs in one basket.
"1 see that Bryan is trying to make
capital with the Germans out of a pre
tended letter of Bismarck's, a part of
which turns out to be a forgery. It is
really immaterial whether the whole let
ter is genuine or not. Of course, Bismarck
wonid like for the United States to adopt
free coinage single handed for he knows
that we would immediately drop to a sil
ver basis, and all our gold would fly to
Europe. Germany would then|unload her
silver on ns and pay our farmers for their
grain and pork in our own depreciated
silver dollars. His benevolent advice to
us is, 'Pitch in, Lemons, and get squeezed.'
Now, Bismarck is the great goldbug of
Europe. Germany was under the control
of ihe Iron Chancellor when she demone
tized silver. Of all the European nations
Germany has been the most stubborn
against any policy tending toward the re
montizatton of silver.
"I have just examined the report of the
monetary conference held at Paris in 1881
by the invitation of the United Slates to
which President Garrield sent Allen G.
Thurman, William M. Evarts, Dana Hor
ton, Reuben E. Fenton and Mr. Groesbeck
as delegates.
"Germany was invited to participate in
the conference, waicti was called for the
purpose of establishing international bi
metallism. Bismarck positively declined
to bave anything to do wiih it. All the
other European nations sent delegates.
Germany alone refused. Bismarck wants
to try the experiment of free coinage on
the other fellow, both to see i ow it works,
as well as to get the other fellow's gold
and unload his old silver on him. He
wants to use the United States just as a
scientist uses a dog for vivisection to test
a th< ory.
"The burden of all of Bryan's speeches
is the depression of business, which he
pretends to think is due to a contraction
of the currency, and with all the
art oi Mephistupheies, he charges
that it is a conspiracy of the rich
to oppress the poor. These speeches
recall the picture that Milton diaws of
Satan squatting in Eden in the shape of a
toad ana whispering damnable suggestions
into the ear of Eve." Bryan is not only a
quack and a demagogue, but an incendi
ary. Whoever tries to array one class
against another â the rich against the
poor â is an enemy of society. YVe all
want to be rich. It is doctrines such as
theseâ the development, of the maxim of
Rousseau that 'property is robbery,' that
set the guillotine to work and drenched
i Paris in blood. Now Bryan's programme
is simply a scheme of confiscation
and spoliation.
"The treasury statement shows that on
August 1, 1896, the volume of currency was
nearly three times larger than it was in
j 1873, when he said silver was demonetized
j (which, is not true), and per capita is
j greater than it ever was in the most pros
i perous year of the country. Ido not my-
I self believe in the per capita theory of
money.
"Those who ascribe the depression in
! business to a scarcity of money confound
cause and effect.
"The prevailing depression is not due to
a scarcity of money. There is more money
in the country than there evÂ«>r was before.
It is lying idle and is not circulating
on account ot the alarm created by silver
agitation. It is the fear of tampering
i with the currency, changing the standard
I of value and dropping to a silver oasis
I that has created distrust, caused a suspen
! sion ot business and stagnation in trade.
"Why there nave been more silver dol
lars coined this year than were cointd
from the beginning of the Government
down to 1873. The Bryan people call
themselves Jefforsonians. They forget
I that Jefferson in 1806 stopped the coinage
iol silver dollars. They ought to call
I Jefferson and Jackson, who put us on the
gold stendard, go.dbugs. Next to Jack
son, a Virginian. R. M. T. Hunter, chair
man of the Finance Com nut tee of the
United States Senate, di-i more than any
other man to demonetize silver. Under the
act of 179^ all the gold and silver coins â
dollars as well as fractional pieces â
were made full legal tender tor any
amount. The fractional coins contained
the same proportional amount of silver
as the dollar, i. c. two half dollars, or four
quarters, contained as much silver as a
dollar. They were at a slight premium
over gold, and hence did not circulate;
i were either melted or exported or sold as
bunion.
"This produced a scarcity of small
change. To remedy the evil Mr. Hunter
in 1853 reduced the amount of silver in
ttie iractionai coins, and reduced their
legal tender value to $5. No mention was
| made of the silver dollar, as it had disap
| peared during J fferson's administration,
I and was as obsolete as a Hint-lock gun.
"I was born in 1833, and never saw an
j American silver dollar until 1878. But i
j when Mr. Hunter made silver mere token
! money he took away the right of free
coinage. The bullion value of tne coins
was less than their face value. If the
owners of silver bullion had been permit
| tea the privilege of coining them then
they would have made a large profit.
"So it was provided that these 'coins
should be issued just as silver is nowâ on
Government account â i. c. the Govern
i_ i it l !Â«â¢ i :__ ; a. a
one presenting $20 worth of these coins at
the treasury can have them redeemed in
gold.
"The silver barons now want the Govern
ment to do what the statutes of 1853 said
they should not do â i. c. coin a lie and
certify that 50 cents is 100 cents. Bryan
has a great deal oi abuse for corporations
and syndicates. He nas nothing to say
against the silversyndicate that is pouring
out its money to elect him.
"Bankers are as much depressed as any
other class. They don't make money by
hoarding it in their vaults, but by ex
changing it. Instead of there not being
enough money jor the requirements of
business, there is not cnougn business to
employ the money that is idle. If we had
free coinage, those who are rich now
would still be the rich; those who are
poor would be poorer.
"Bryan himself admits that his election
will cause a monetary panic, but says
such a ht-roic remedy is necessary to cure
the disease from which tiie country is suf
fering. I think the remedy he proposes is
worse than the disease. Instead of a
panic, McKinley's election will restore
hope and business confidence to the coun
try and start again the wheels of industry.
"I have just received the Index, pub
lished at my old home, Warreuton, Va.
It is a Bryan free silver paper. It has a
letter eiving an account of tne organiza
tion of a sound money club at Marshall,
Fauquier county. The platform adopted
says: "That we, members of the Upper
Fauquier Sound Money League, hereby
express our determination to use every
lf-gitimat' means to advance the cause of
sound money by opposing the Chicago
platform and the candidates nominated
thereon." The letter says: "The league
is growing, and the woods are full of gold
bugs.
"Marshall is somewhat of a historic
town. It is situated in a lovely blue-^rass
repion near the home of Chief Justice
Marshall. At tie close ot the war
I took leave of my command at that
place; in 1872 I opened there the cam
paign for Grant in a joint debate with
General Hunton, afterward United States
Senator. When I was in Virginia last fall
I drove up there w> look again over the
old scenes and was taken with an attack
of appendicitis that came near carrying
me off. The same paper has a letter from
James V. Brooke, an eminent lawyer of the
Virginia bar, announcing his reasons for
repudiating Bryan and his platform.
"Mr. Brooke says: 'Believing that the
Chicago platform is eminently un-Demo
cratic and fraught with most serious
danger to the country in all its inte r ests,
and finding myself free and a Democratic
platform and candidates ready to my
hand, I shall support them [Palmar and
Buckner] and let consequences take care
of themselves.' "
FELL TO DEATH

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, OCTOBER 5, 1896.
PUNTING OF
HISTORIC TREES
A Patriotic Work of Se
quoia Chapter of
This City.
A Contribution From Each of
the Thirteen Original
. States.
TO BE IN GOLDEN GATE PARK.
Nineteenth of the Current Month
Selected for This EventâPatri
otic Children.
Monday, the 19th inst., will be a historic
day in San Francisco, for on that day the
members of Sequoia Chapter of the
Daughters of the American Revolution
will plant in Golden Gate Park thirteen
trees to represent the thirteen original
States of the Union.
Some time ago Mrs. S. Isahelle Hubbard,
a prominent member of the chapter named,
received a letter from Mrs. Peter J.
Hughes, corresponding secretary of Merion
Chapter of Pennsylvania, as follows:
By planting the sequoia trees in Golden Gate
Ph/k several years ago, Sequoia Chapter has
linked the history of the American revolu
tion with the dawn of creation; perhaps with
the end of time.
Now, many of the Western chapters have a
colonial history also, either French or Spanish;
for it is a vulgar error to suppose that England
is the mother country ot the United States.
Pennsylvanians in particular resent this idea;
so do some New \ orkers, who claim that the
test ot American citizenship comes from the
Dutch. Pennsylvania comes from the Swedes,
Welch, Germans, Dutch, Huguenots and
I Scotch-Irish rather than English. It seems to
| me that Sequoia Chapter might make a great
deal of the Mission Dolores, the Presidio and
Sir Francis Drake's Cross. This last links Cali
lornia's history to Sir Walter Raleigh and
North Carolina and Virginia. If lam not
mistaken, the Mission Dolores was founded Jn
1776. The more southern missions even
earlier. Mrs. Leland Stanford, a member of
Sequoia Chapter, has already erected a statue
to Father Junipero Setra. Why is it not gen
erally made known thai this is the work of a
daughter of the American revolution who ap
preciates colonial history?
Now it is the desire of tue members of Merion
Chapter to help Mother Sequoia if. possible.
Accordingly I suggest that Sequoia plant thir
teen trees in Goiaen Gate Park, one from each
i of the original States. The trees should be
! planted in a semi-circle, representing the his
j toric arch along the Atlantic, with Pennsyl-
I vania's tree in the middle of the keysione.
Mrs. Hubbard opened a correspondence
with the State Regents of the thirteen
original States, in accordance with the
suggestions of Mrs. Hu. hes and received
from each a most enthusiastic reply. Mas
sachusetts will send an elm from the grave
of Captain Isaac Davis, Old North Bridge,
Conn., who, on April 19, 1775, led the first
I oreanized attact upon the troops of
; George 111.
New York will send a white oak from
the Saratoga battle-fields, Rhode Island a
plane tree "irom the birthplace of General
Nathaniel Greene, Delaware a locust
from Belmont Hall, the home of the early
governors of the State; South Carolina a
I magnolia from the Cowpens battle
ground, Connecticut a scion of the famous
Cnarter Oak, Pennsylvania a tulip tree
from Valley Forge camp-ground, and the
other States will each send a tree from
some historic spot.
The tree from Rhode Island was received
last week and others are expected within
the next if w days.
Mrs. Hubbard and Mrs. William Alvord
called on Superintendent McLaren a few
days ago, and he entered into the spirit
of the proposition with great zest, and a
few days since selected the place where
the historic trees will bo planted on the
19th inst., with appropriate ceremonies.
The site is in the old '49 mining camp, a
little west of the bearpit. The southern
leg of the arch will be opposite the Jine of
the Roman bridge across Stow Lake and
the northern one be near the north drive.
The span is about 600 feet. The thirteen
trees will be planted in the form of an
| arch, with the tulips from Pennsylvania
ias the keystone. This site was selected
by the superintendent because it is well
sheltered, and as he says "those trees
from the East require a eood deal of shel
ter when they are transplanted."
The arrangements for the event are not
quite complete, but thus far it is known
that Z. U. Dodge, an attorney of this City,
will deliver the oration. Miss Martin
will recite a patriotic poem and Mrs. J.
French will probably write an original
poem. Th 3 First United States Infantry
band will furnish the niu-<ic and the High
School Cadets will attend as a company.
It is expected that Captain Howison of the
Oregon will send a detachment of
marines and that Captain Sumner of the
Monadnock, himself a Son of the Ameri
can Revolution, will send a detachment
of men, and General VVarfield will ds
asked to lend aid to the occasion.
The arrangements will probably be con
cluded this week.
Patrlotic Children.
A meeting of the Valentine Holt Society
of the Children of the American Revolu
How the ** Examiner n Misrepresents "Wbrkingmen,
tion was held hut Saturday at the resi
dence of Mrs. L. L. Baker, 1882 Washing
ton street. There was notwithstanding
the many attracions a large attendance.
Edith M. and William Wizard Crocker,
children of Mr. and Mrs. W. H. Crocker
and descendants of Colonel Setb Read of
the Massachusetts' line of the Continental
Army, Humptirey Williard, same line,
and Ebenezer Sperry, sergeant of Colo
nel Ward's company of Connecticut line,
were elected to membership.
The donation by Colonel A. S. Hubbard
of the Sons of the American Revolution
of a copy of Washington's farewell address
was acknowledged.
A very interesting paper on "Our Flag"
by Harrold S. Warren, grandson of Rev.
J. H. Warren of this City, was read and
well received.
At the close of the meeting the children
were entertained with a literary and mus
ical programme.
THEATRICAL EMPLOYES.
Union Sixteen Held a Successful Picnic
at Germania (>ardeiig<
Union 16 of the mechanical employes of
the San Francisco theaters held a well
attended picnic at Germania Gardens
yesterday.
Sixty gate prizes, with four prizes for
the best lady and gentleman waltzers,
kept the committee busy during the day
in deciding among the contestants and
distributing the prizes to the successful
holders of the winning numbers.
"Smithy" of the Tivoli and Jack Wilson
ot the Baldwin were prominent in con
ducting the exercises and making it pleas
ant for those who attended.
The gardens were crowded from early
morning until late in the evening. The
chorus girls from the numerous places of
amusement were there rigged out in the
loveliest of summer dresses and decorated
headgear.
Everybody seemed to be happy, and as
all were acquainted with each other there
was no such thing as estrangement or stiff
formality in making acquaintance. The
following are the officers of the union:
President, Robert Little; vice-president,
Otto Romer; secretary, Carl Taylor;
treasurer, Ihe Martser; financial secre
tary, Steve Ryan.
BEAT A CRIPPLED TEAM
Imperials, Minus Their Pitcher,
Defeated by the San
Franciscos.
Almost Faultless Fielding Game
Played by the Successful
Ball-Tossers.
The Imperials had no more chance to
win yesterday's game from the San Fran
ciscos than a one-armed man would have
to win a wrestling match. With all their
players in position it was an almost dead
even proposition, but when they had to
substitute Eber to pitch in Kelly's place,
nothing but a miracle would have accom
plished a victory for them. Kelly was in
jured in a wagon accident and unable to
play.
Eber lasted just one inning in the box.
During that time ten of the San Franciscos
came to the bat, five of whom hit safely
and six of whom scored. Mouahan and
Beckett were eacn presented with a base
on balls. In addition to his other troubles,
Eber made two wild pitches.
Smith relieved Eber in the second and
the latter went to third, where hia exhibi
t ion was almost as bad as his battery
work. The little third baseman pitched
remarkable ball considering bis lack of
practice, and until he grew tired in the
sixth the San Franciscos were practically
at hia mercy. Lack of condition toid,
however, and four hits bunched in each
the sixth and seventh innings netted
Blake's men eight runs. They bad also
made one in the second on a hit,
Creamer's error and a wild pitch.
It looked like a shutout for the Im
perials up to the eighth, and the San Fran
cisco men played with might and main to
make it one. In the last inning but one
a single by Tillson, followed by Creamer's
double, earned a run. Creamer also
scored on wo sacrifice hits.
The eighth inning was also marked by
the only error charged to the local play
ers. Murphy fumbled a slow, twisting
ground ball from Smith's bat. It was an
excusable misplay and an unfortunate
one, as it marred what would otherwise
have been a faultless fielding game.

FEAST OF THE
HOLY ROSARY
The Dominicans Elaborately
Observe Their Annual
Festival.
Solemn and Imposing Procession
Following the High
Mass.
BLESSED ROSES DISTRIBUTED
Many Devout Worshipers Visit the
Church to Obtain Indulgences at
the Altar of Mary.
In the Catholic calendar few feasts are
more devoutly observed and have greater
significance that the solemn feast of the
most holy rosary. The feast was first
instituted in commemoration of the fa
mous battle of Lepanto on October 7,
1571, when the Christians' arms won a de
cisive victory over the Turks, who were on
the eve of overrunning Europe. The con
duct of this feast is particularly enjoined
upon churches under the care of the order
of St. Dominic, and though the occasion
was not unnoticed in other churches of
the City, it was at St. Dominic's, on Bush
and Steiner streets, that the main observ
ance was held.
The edifice, which was crowded for the
occasion, was beautifully decorated, and
the magnificent choir was at its best.
Previous to the rendition of solemn high
mass blessed roses were distributed to
members of the congregation. These
roses are eagerly sought by the devout
and prized as relics.
After the mass Rev. J. B. O'Connor,
0.P., delivered a sermon on the occasion.
He stated that the devotion of the holy
rosary was revealed to St. Dominic by
the blessed virgin Mary, who commanded
him to preach it throughout the world.
He extolled the virtues of the rosary,
which he declared to be adapted to the
learned and the ignorant and to every ca
pacity. He exhorted his hearers to be un
swerving in this service.
At the conclusion of the sermon an im
poying procession of the clergy and lay
men of the church was formed. The pro
cession, led by the Dominican fathers,
marched from the church door, via Steiner
street to Pine, thence to Pierce, to Bush,
to the point of beginning. The partici
pants were:

In the afternoon the edifice was viewed
by hundreds who came to visit the altar
oi the rosary and obtain the indulgence
promised to those who perform this devo
tion.
In the evening the procession was re
peated, after which RÂ«*v. D. Maher
preached an appropriate sermon.
HONORED ITS PATRON.
Interesting: Commemorative Ser
vices at St. Francis Church.
At St. Francis Church the feast of the
holy rosary gave way by regular prece
dence to the least of St. Francis of Assisi,
the church's patron saint. A solemn high
mass was celebrated by Rev. Father Giles,
with Rev. Father Heslin as deacon and
Rev. Father Caraher as sub-deacon. As
the evening discourse was to be a pane
gyric of St. Frauds, Father Heslin deliv
ered a discourse upon the holy rosary.
In th evening Rev. Leo Brunner, Order
of St. Francis, delivered the panegyric.
He briefly sketched the life if the saint
and dwelt upon his virtues, his poverty,
humility and intense love of the Re
deemer. From his intense love and his
long meditation upon the crucifixion he
received upon his own limbs the stigma
of his bavior. From the lile of St. Francis
the speaker drew many beautiiul lessons
which he exhorted his hearers to heed.
FIRST COMMUNION.
Eighty-Two Girls and Seventy Boys
Received ac St. Peter's?
An event of unusual interest at St, Pe
ter's Church yesterday was tde reception
of a large class of youne communicants,
consisting of eighty-two girls and seventy
boys. Of these about half were pupils of
the convent and the boys' school which
are under the patronage of the church.
The others were from the public schools.
Roy. Father Casey read mass, after which
he delivered an address to the children
calculated to impress upon them the
solemnity of the vows which they had
just undertaken.
MRS. BOOTH SPEAKS.
Tells ot Prison Experiences and of a
Convicts' Refuge In Tills
City.
The largest number of persons that ever
crowded into the Y. M. C. A. Auditorium
assembled there yesterday afternoon to
hear Mrs. Bailington Booth, one of the
leaders of the American Volunteers, re
cently formed as a result of the disrup
tion between the American Booths and
the head of the Salvation Army in Eng
land. Over 400 persons, many of them
women, remained standing for two hours
as both seating and standing room was
fully occupied. On the stage with Mrs.
Booth were Major Blackhurst and Cap
tain Bradley, officers of the new organiza
tion here, and Rabbi Jacob Voorsaneer
and a number of clergymen and others
interested in the success of Mrs. Booth's
prison reform and slum work.
"It had been supposed," said Mrs.
Booth, "that the American Volunteers
started as a new organization with a capi
tal of $1,000,000. It started with just $100
and then founded in New York City its
little weekly paper, the Volunteer Ga
zette, and secured headquarters. In the
very few months of its existence the
movement has grown encouragingly.
There are already 2000 persons in the
United States who, as sympathizers with
the work, have become members of the
Volunteer League, and contribute $5 a
year for its support, and who, whenever
opportunity offers, speak a good word for
those actively engaged as uniformed
workers in the Dew army.
On this coast the development has been
very encouraging. Starting three months
ago with but two posts, this division will
before the end of this month have eleven
actively in the field.
In a few days, Mrs. Booth says, a home
is to be established in this City for re
formed convicts, where, after coming di
rectly from prison 1 , they may be helped
until honorable employment can be found
for them. The rent of the building will
be $30 a month, and many little things
must be provided for it. "If," said Mrs.
Booth, "any one has a sheet or a pillow
case, or a bedspread or lnrniture, or crock
ery or tinware he or she would like to
give to help fit up this home for 'my
boys,' it would be most acceptable and be
very gratefully received."
"1 think," continued Mrs. Booth, "that
through the work of the last three months,
through its heartburnings and its trials,
I have seemed to know more of myself
and of my own heart than I ever felt in
the most sweeping success of a great
cause. It is in the dark hour that we feel
the help of God."
In ttie evening Mrs. Booth an dressed
even a larger audience â one that tilled the
main floor, the galleries and the adjacent
and approaching stairways at the old Y.
M. C. A. building, on Butter street, above
Kearny. There was a solid mass of peo
ple eagerly listening, many of them stand
ing so far outside the doorways that they
were unable to catch all that was said.
During her remarks upon the new cause
she is espousing, Mrs. Booth referred only
once to the Salvation Army, for which 3he
had been until recently so tireless and
valued a worker. It was not in a dispar
aging way, nor did she mention the name
of the body, yet every one knew what she
meant when she declared that a work of
this kind should not have its head in a
foreign country : it should be within the
Nation.
As in the afternoon, a subscription was
taken up, and in addition tickets were cir
culated for those so inclined to sign and
become members oi the Auxiliary League
for one year, by each agreeing to pay $5
toward its work.
NEW TO-DAT.
Night
Sweats
Do you ever wake up in the night to
find yourself bathed in perspiration, which
stands in beads on your forenead, feeling
as if every pore in your skin was teeming
with a weakening sweat? You feel a hot
flush over your whole body, and for relief
you throw off the covers. Your hot flush
soon gives way to a clammy, sticky feel-
ing, as you get chilled and your circula-
tion gets sluegish. Then you feel limp
and weak, as if these night sweats were
sapping the .very lif â  out of you. Perhaps
you allow yourself to ooze off to sleep and
forget to pull up the covers and you catch
cold. A few nights of this kind bring you
to a realization that you are weakening in
nerve force and vitality. You take a tonic
or stimulant in your effort to ward off the
symptoms that warn you of a total col-
lapse of your nerve and vital forces, and
soon find that such stimulation leaves a
reaction that kills your ambition and
ruins your stomach. Don't you see that
medicines won't cure you? You need the
toning and invigorating effects of a mini
current of electricity, such as you can get
by applying Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt.
It is life and vitality to your tired nerves
and induces a calm, peaceful sleep, from
which you wake refreshed, with your fac-
ulties alert and active and an appetite for
breakfast and ambition for work.
A San Francisco Cure.
"When I received your belt on May 6 I was
In a broken-down condition both pnysicially
and mentally, had no ambition for anything,
could not sleep well, had night sweats, a poor
appetite and wes always thinking about my
trouble, which you called nervous debility
and seminal weakness. After I had worn the
belt a month I was much improved, and I
gradually became stronger every day, and to-
day I am a better man tnan I have ever been.
I would recommend yonr belt to all sufferers
from the above troubles. It will cure without
fail," writes GUST JOHNSON, 613 Mission
street, San Francisco.
Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt strengthens
the nerve forces and adds vitality to the
system. Its strengthening effect on the
vital organs equalizes and quickens the
circulation and overcomes the weakness
that follows these night sweats. Get the

to outsiders.
The first step in municipal improvement
will be taken when Cnarles L. Taylor is
elected Mayor.
All the industries of California need pro
tection, and all who care for the welfare of
the State will vote to protect them.
One of tne reasons why Bryan talks so
much is tbat he has to do something to
keep people from listening to Watson.
Would free silver stop the importation
of foreign goods? Would it open an
American factory for the employment of
American labor?
After the campaign is over there will be
a good deal of fun in watching the Demo
crats and Populists untangle themselves
from one another.
The American people delight in straight
politics, and the tricks and trades of the
fusionists will prove on election day to
have been bad bargains for both sides.
Ever since the Southern Pacific company
threw the Examiner a $30, 0W bone and then
withdrew it, the animal Das been a madder
and more dangerous canine than ever.
In what way can the Republican party
be benefited by a factional fight on
Colonel Taylor? Io what way would Sa:)
Francisco be benefited by deleating him?
The Examiner was never in favor of free
silver as long as it was on the Southern
Pacific payroll, and, perhaps tbe change
of tone In politics may be due somewhat
to the lack of change in the till.
The price oi wheat is rising, better times
are coming for the farmers, and all we
need now to make prosperity certain is to
elect McKinley, restore the protective sys
tem and set the factories running.
There are two notable features in this
campaign: One is the small number of
spell-binders taking part in it, and the
other is the extraordinary activity in the
canvass of professors and clergymen.
According to the stenographers who
travel with him Bryan speaks usually at
the rate of 100 words a minute, bat as he
repeats himself all the time ther* is no
danger of his exhausting the vocabulary.
President Green of the Texas Midland
Railroad says, '"We expect to carry Texas
for McKinley. and I haven't a donbt of it."
la there any place at all bigger than a
county where the Democrats have a sure
thing this year?
When Coxey ran for Congress in Ohio
he drew larger crowds than any man that
ever ran in the district, but on election
day he received less than 9000 votes out of
a total of over 42,000. There is in that a
lesson for the Bryan boomers.
The New York Sun advises the Demo
crats of that State to give all their admira
tion to General Palmer and all their votes
to McKinley, and while there is a sugges
tion of the straddle-bug in the proposition
it will be noted that the vote is to be
straight.
The attempt of some Eastern papers to
excite discord in the Democratic camp by
circulating the story that Bryan voted for
Weaver in 1892 will be futile. The class
of Democrats who are following Bryan
would just as soon Vote for Weaver them
selves as not.
In the State of New York there is not a
single man ot National repute who is sup
porting the Bryan ticket. Democracy is
confused everywhere in this campaign,
but in the Empire Btate, the former
stronghold of the party, it has virtually
dissolved into empty air.
Massachusetts has discovered that un
der her law it is no offense to deface bal
lots cast in a political caucus so as to
make them invalid and thus bring about
the nomination of a minority candidate.
But who could hare supposed that Massa
chusetts politicians would ever have
(bought of doing such a thing ?
THE VALLEY ROAD.
The entry into Fresno of the San Fran
cisco and San Joaquin Valley Railroad
marks another epoch ia the history of
one of the greatest and most benelicent
enterprises which California has under
taken for many years. It is only a little
over a year since the first contracts for
tee erading and material for the Valley
road were let and the actual labor of con
struction begun. Since then the work has
been steadily pushed forward in ?pite oi
such obstacles as hard times, obstruction
ists and an election campaign. The first ob
jective point was the largest city ot the
Central San Joaqnin Valley, and this has
just been reached. The railway has thus
its first terminal point, and even though
it is but a temporary one it gives the road
all of the incidents of a complete trans
portation line and euables it to compete
with its rival between Stockton and
Fresno on an equal footing.
The credit of having kept this great
railroad project moving during the past
year belongs to the sturdy and faithful
few whose money was subscribed so lib
erally and expended so cheerfully for its
construction, and whore business sense
sees in it not only a fair investment for
themselves, but a great boon for Califor
nia.
The celebration which will occur to-day
in Fresno will doubtless express the gen
eral public feeling of gratitude toward the
promoters of the Valley road. It will be
participated in by the people from all
parts of the great and fertile valley to
whom it has already brought the needed
blessing of competition in ttjeir railway
service.
It will also be a matter of interest and
gratification to the ueople of the entire
State.who regard the Valley road as an in
stitution calculated to beueiit every sec
tion and industry within its entire area.
It it ndt more currency this country wants.
It has an abundance. But it is confidence,
which is currency; confidence which starts
the mills going, puts the furnaces in blast,
opens the mines, creates a demand for coal
and for coke and for iron ore, which burdens
the railways with the product of the field, tlu
forest, the mountain and the jactory.â
Chattacey Depew.
PARTY UNITY.
The Republican party all over the coun
try is presenting a united front to those
who have banished prosperity anil who
would keep it in exile by continuing in
power and persisting in their erratic
ideas of finance and free trade. The Re
publicans of California will surely see the
wisdom of creating and preserving a like
unity in the local party.
The efforts of the State Central Com
mittee to bring about party harmony, and
its result, have been received with gen
era! satisfaction by the press and people
of the State. The manly acquiescence of
Mr. Sonntag and ortier leading Republi
cans in the judgment of the committee
has evoked praise from all who believe in
party harmony as essential to victory.
It is to be hoped that the present week
will see the recest breach entirely closed
and all loyal Republicans in line and
laboring together for the success of a
single ticket. This is a consummation
devoutly to be wished. It is the duty of
every Republican who submits his claims
to the decision of the State Central Com
mittee to aecepi and abide by its decree
and fall in line with the regular organiza
tion in a united effort for the success of
the party.
An Englishman probably would say that
free trade is a principle, Jounded on the uni
versal brotherhood of humanity and individual
rights. We viust acknowledge the truth of
thie statement; but circumstances alter cases.
We have not, as yet, airived at a full under
standing of this universal brotherhood â this
great ouqiess of life. We must bow to the fiat
of our great mother, Nature. We must pre
serve ourselves; we viuat protect our own
itUrrests.â Miss America FhiUips of Ne w York:
CALIFORNIA'S LABOR DAY
To-day is Labor day in California, and,
therefore, there will be a pretty general
suspension of industrial operations. More
ana more labor is influencing aud shaping
legislation in its own interests, and among
the many advantages already secured are
days set apart under law for the recreation
and reunion of working oeople. In this,
as in every other public matter in which
labor combines to accomplish, it not only
itself lakes a step forward, but carries the
social and business existence of the whole
country forward with it.
They have Labor days in Europe and all
branches of the wage class observe them,
but not as they are observed by American
labor. In this country such days are given
up to merrymaking and other kinds of
healthgiving entertainment, and when
the day is done the participants feel all
the better for the outing, tut the rule in
Europe is to gather upon such occasions
for the agitation of political questions,
which leaves the participants in rather a
worse mental condition. That, however,
is attributable to the fact that the wage
man in Europe is a cos in a
great industrial and political wheel. Ue
gets such liberty and opportunity for per
sonal use as "divine right" deems best for
him, while in this country the wage-man
is himself a sovereign and has a voice in
granting rights and privileges.
There is no donbt that the American
workingman is far better circumstanced
than his fellows in any other country, but
it is because he participates intelligently
and with a patriotic spirit in ail the work
leading up to the enactment and adminis
tration of the laws under which he lives.
The American workingman ennobles labor
because he is a freeman and because it is
! good and right to honestly earn that which
I he wants. There will not be too many
| days set apart for labor's use, for labor
j itself can be depended upon to regulate
that, nor will there be too few days in
which labor may seek relief from the cares
of active employment, for labor would not
permit it. The splendid manhood of
American labor can always be depended
i upon to do what is best for America and
; American institutions.
I believe in America for Americansâna
tive born and naturalized. I believe in the
â American payroll, and 1 do not believe in
diminishing that payroll by giving work to
anybody else under another flag while we
have got an idle man under our flag. â 3fc-

BRYAN'S SUPPORTERS.
If the newspapers of a party reflect the
sentiments of the rank and tile, Mr. Bryan
will have to look elsewhere than to the
Democratic party for votes. Over 200 of
the leading Democratic newspapers which
gave Cleveland hearty support are oppos
ing Bryan's election, and of the great
commercial centers only in San Francisco,
New Orleans, St Louis and Denver are to
be found Democratic papers that advocate
the election of the Chicago nominee. As
far as can be ascertained those newspapers
which have repudiated Bryanism have
lost neither in advertising nor in sub
scribers, while those which swallowed the
Chicago platform and candidates have not
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, OCTOBER 5, 1896.
increased their subscription list nor added
to their advertising patronage.
When a party newspaper takes a course
that is not approved of by the rank and
file it is immediately felt in the agency
and subscription departments. If the
hundreds of Democratic newspapers
which supported Cleveland and which
are now opposing Bryan were not
in harmony with the sentiments of
their patrons, as a business proposition
they would at lea?t be less vehement in
their denunciation of Bryan and all tha
he represents, but it appears that in repu
diating the Chicago convention's work
these bolting newspapers were moved to
do so by the sentiment of the party, and
tbat the rank and file and not the news
papers took the lead.
If one cares to look over the field to see
what newspaper support Bryan hss he
will find it confined almost entirely to
such papers as belong to the Populist
family of publications, and that where ex
ceptions io that rule are found it will be
discovered that the paper is owned or con
trolled by owners of silver raining prop
erty. It is a conspicuous fact that not one
journal, newspaper or other publication
tbat is devoted to trade, traffic, commerce
or finance is favoring Bryan's election.
Only here aud there is found a successful
business man, be he engaged in industry,
agriculture, transportation or in the pro
motion of business enterprises, who is ad
vocating the election of the Chicago nom
inee. In the field of mechanical seill and
labor the majority are found demanding
that protection be not only made the para
mount issue in the campaign, but tbat it
have precedence over all other legislation
when Congress meets. Who, then, is sin
cerely supporting Bryan? Only those
who are seeking political preferment,
those who are interested in silver produc
tion and those who refuse to think for
themselves.
1 affirm that whereas in evjry gold standard
country for the latt forty years the improve
ment of labor has been marked and the pur
chasing power of wages increased, in every
country where silver is the standard the lot
of the laboring man has not improved; that
lie works longer hours for lets results; that
the protection which free silver gives simply
comes to him in a pitiable forvi of lower
wages and less comfort. â Hon. E. If". Bar
rett. _______________
NOT MUCH OF AN ECONOMIST.
Mr. A. C. Ellis of Salt Lake is in San
Francisco trying to infuse a little life into
the Bryan cause. Mr. Ellis is a good deal
of an orator, but not much of a political
economist. He addressed a silver meet
ing at Metropolitan Temple last Thursday
night and labored very hard 'o prove that
there could not be overproduction of com
modities. He said: ''How can there be
overproduction of cereals when there are
thousands of our fellow-countrymen
starving? How can there be overproduc
tion of fabrics when many people have not
clothes to wear?"
It is the easiest thing in the world, Mr.
Ellis, to have overproduction when thou
sands are suffering for things overpro
duced. In fact, overproduction comes
from the inability of consumers to buy
that which is produced for consumption.
Producers do not produce just for the fun
of producing. They produce because they
hope to find buyers in the market for their
products, and in ratio to the inability of
buyers to buy are their products over-
produced. If consumers of provisions are
starving, that shows they have no money
to buy things to appease their hunger,
and j-o any production at all would be
overproduction. All of anything pro
duced that is in excess of the demand ;s
overproduction.
For three years now there has been
overproduction of breadstuffs and provi
sions, and not a little of it lias gone to
waste because there have been no buyers,
and all this, too. in the face of the cruel
fact that thousands of people were suffer
ing for something to eat. But why have
the people lived under such conditions,
Mr. Ellis ? Why has there been so much
hunger in the face of such quantities of
breadstuffs and provisions ? Have pro
ducers been unwilling to sell, or have con
sumers been unwilling to buy ? Come,
Mr. Ellis, and let us reason together.
The ground has yielded its accustomed
quantity of cereals, and fanners and deal
ers have been anxious to sell, but why
have they not sold, Mr. Ellis ? The rea
son if consumers have had no money to
pay for breadstuffs ana provisions, but
why have they not ? Because Mr. Ellis'
candidate for President, W. J. Bryan, and
Â« number of others of liis way of thinking
enacted a law three years aao which closed
our industries and threw thousands of our
fellow-countrymen out of employment,
thus depriving them of opportunity to
earn money to bay farm products and mill
fabrics, and thru is why there is "overpro
duction when there are thousands of our
fellow-countrymen starving and have no
clothes to wear."
Mr. Elii3 is in California to persuade the
people to vote for Bryan and continue
tne?e conditions. To be sure, Mr. Ellis
9ays if the mints are thrown open to the
free and unlimited coinage of silver 'here
would be plenty of money to buy the over
production of food products, but he must
explain how the opening of the mints to
the silver of bis Btate is going to open the
avenues of labor employment in San Fran
cisco; and he mast explain how the starv
ing thousands are going to get hold of the
silver dollars made of Utah white metal
unless the mills and factories are opened
to their skill and muscle.
It is a mere pretense to attribute the hard
times to the fad that all our currency is on a
gold basis. Good vioney never made times
hard. Those who assert that our present in
dustrial and financial depression w the re
suit of the gold standard have not read Amer
ican history aright or been careful stu
dents of the events of recent years. We never
had greater prosperity in this country, in
every field of employment and industry, than
in the, busy years from 1880 to 1892, during
all of which time this country was on a gold
basis and employed more gold money in its
fiscal business operations than ever before. â
McKinley.
FIVE TO ONE.
Five for McKinley to one for Bryan is
tha way the commercial travelers of Cali
fornia stand, as shown by The Call's poll
of nearly 200 representative members of
the fraternity. This showing is not sur
prising, for commercial travelers must
have good times to make their journeys
profitable, and times have not been good
since Bryan's kind of a tariff superseded
the McKinley law.
It may be said that the commercial
traveler has a better opportunity than
any one else to know the state of trade.
He is in close touch with the retailer of
goods and wares all the time. If the coun
try is buying goods liberally his booking
of orders is large, and if buying is light
orders come slowly and for small quanti
ties. Hence it is that the opinion of a
"sample merchant" of the present and
prospective state of trade the country ovar
is accepted as reflecting the true condition
of general business.
When such a large majority of the com
mercial travelers give it as their opinion
that the trade and commerce of the coun
try need not expect any expansion in vol
ume until the McKinley theory of protec
tion is put into practical operation, it is
perfectly safe to act upon it.
COAST EXCHANGES.
The Astoria AVim, twenty months old, has
increased its size and will endeavor to widen
its sphere of influence. Its editors express the
belief that the tone of journalism in Astoria
has been railed about half a note or more
since the AÂ«rÂ» entered the field.
Bright and attractive is the initial numbre
of The Western Shoeman, to be published weekly
in San Francisco and Denver. It is issued in
magazine form, twenty-six pages, and a high
degree of excellence has been attained in its
printing and illustrations. It is the first pub
lication of the kind west of the Missouri
River and will strive to enable the shoe
dealers scattered over this great expanse of
country to feel the pulse of trade without con
sulting the distant Eastern journals.
That the people of Oakland are not falling
over one another in the effort to sustain the
cause of free silver is made evident by the
fate of the short-lived paper "16 to 1." It died
within a mouth of its birthday and right in
the heart of the campaign, too. The editors
declare that they obtained no kupport aud
could not run the sheet on wind. There Is a
lesson in their parting words: "Our mistake
was in believing that a good many more peo
ple wanted the sort of paper we issued than w
found to be the case, therefore we promptly
closed the incident."
The Vallejo Times was twenty-one years old
last Tuesday. It is too bad to see a healthy,
good-looking young paper like that following
a Eryanese will-o'-the-wisp at such an age.
The Reno (Nev.) GareÂ«ehas just opened its
forty-second volume. It is one of the stanch
Republican papers of our sister State that the
silver barons, with all their influence, could
not draw away from the cause of protection
and sound money.
Eureka, Cal., has a new daily paper, the
Double Standard. It strikes us that It is a mis
nomer. It favors a policy that will simply
lead to silver monometallism and Single Stan
dard would appear to be a more appropriate
title for it.
J. S. Taylor has resurrected the Arbuckle
Transcript. It is a Democratic paper now. At
the top of the editorial page is the motto, "Ir
rigate or Emigrate." If this be a Demoeraiic
order and its alternative it is too severe.
There are many good people who neither drink
nor vote that way.
The Dunsmuir Kews says that the new rail
road now beiug built from Upton to the Mc-
Cloud River will be a valuable piece of prop
erty when completed. It will control a body
of sugar-pine timber that Is 100 miles long and
can be built through a country that ia rich in
agriculture and stock-raising, and that is now
400 miles from a railroad in any direction. A
country 400 miles square is a principality in
itself. There Is nothing to hinder the pro
jectors of this road from becoming enormously
rich.
J. W. Lee has commenced the publication of
the Pomona Democrat. It is opined that he
will find it wearing on his strength to row
against the swelling tide of McKinleylsm
down that way.
The St. Helena Star has celebrated its twen
ty-second birthday. The longer it shines the
brighter it gets.
Year by year it becomes more and more ap
parent, says the Ukiah llerald, that the lands
in Mendocino County, on the headwaters of
Russian River, embracing many thousand
acres, may be ranked among the best grape,
growing lands of tho State. "This is especially
true of table grape*. A number of vineyards
in the immediate vicinity of Ukiah, by the
yield of the present year, prove this beyond
all contradiction. The wine made by a fÂ«w of
our vineyardists sells in San Francisco much
above market quotations, and yet but few of
our people have turned their attention to
grape-growing as a business. Let us hope that
some of our enterprising men having lands
suitable may turn their attention to this in
dustry and show to the world what Mendocino
can do in the way of wine and raisins."
The Redding Free Press informs us that the
Integral Quicksilver Mining Company, at Cin
nabar, have put a large force of men to work
cleaning up and further developing their
property. "The Altooona mine is being rnn
at its fullest capacity. About 050 flasks oi
quicksilver, valued at $20,000, are produced
monthly. The company gives employment to
over 350 men, sixty-five of that number being
underground miners. Although the camp is
wholly dependent upon the mining industry,
which might iead one to believe that It would
cause sympathy for the free silver movement,
there are v large number of Republicans
there."
A rich and extensive copper mine is located
in the mountains near Fresno and the Republi
can of that city, in telling its readers about it,
remarks that the fact will probably be news to
a majority of Fresno people, but that they
have become accustomed to surprises in the
line of natural resources and now take them
in a matter of fact way. Says the Republican:
"The Copper King was discovered some
twelve years ago, but was not worked to any
great extent until the present companyâ the
Los Angelei Petroleum, Smelting and Mining
Company â bonded the mine and began oper
ating it, finding a marvelously rich body of
ore. The mine is the property of Hugh Knep
per, who ran about 180 feet of tunneling.
This was about eight years ago and the ore
taken out was shipped by way of Cape Ilorn
to Baltimore, where it was reduced. Copper
was at tbat time very high.
"The present company, of which Dr. G. 11.
Bryant of Los Angeies is the prime mover, took
charge of the property about ten months ago,
and has beeu developing it ever since. Thir
teen men are now employed at the mine, but
the company will soon pat on a larger force.
A number of improvements will be made in
the near future.
"The main body of ore lies in a semicircle
iv a laminated formation, and a tunnel 450
feet long has been cut through from one
ravine to another, following tho apex of the
ore body, which lies in large swells, showing
a width of from a lew feet to as high as twenty
eight feet.
'â¢The ore is in three formsâ blfiok oxide,
sulphite and carbonate. The blacic oxide pre
dominates and is the richest. It looks not un
like hard coal, but is much heavier and crum
bles very ea-silv. A recent assay of the ox
ide, taken from where the ledge is twenty
eight feet wide, showed 37 per cent of copper,
$i) per ton in gold and some silver. The bltck
oxide will average from $70 to $80 a ton In
all, and some of it goes as high as $1U iv gold."
NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
The British battle-ship Prince George, 14,900
tons, had an eight-hour trial recently under
natural draught, which proved highly satis
factory, as the speed was 10.52 knots with
10,404 horsepower. The ship's draught was
24 feet 11 inches forward and 25 feet 2 inches
aft, or about 1500 tons short of her sea-going
displacement.
Spain is preparing to increase her navy, and
has made contracts with an English firm for
the coustruction ol a 10,500-ton battle-ship
and a cruiser of GSOO tons. In addition a
cruiser of 1800 tons and 20-knot speed, and
also two torpedo-destroyers, are to be built in
England. T'Â«e battle-ship and largo cruiser
are to be built aud delivered in the shortest
possible time, and only eighteen months' time
is allowed for the small cruiser.
Experiments with petroleum fuel have been
made by all great naval powers of late years,
and the prospects are that it will be largely
adopted, and, so far as torpedo - boats
are concerned, will take the place of coal and
other fuel. The advantages consist of a large
reduction in weight; the oil can be stored for
the most part below the water line, out of the
way of shells. There is no danger of spon
taneous combustion as with coal, and the
boilers are less liable to injury, as the oil con
tains no sulphur. Firing is extremely simple,
the force of firemen can oe greatly reduced,
coal-trimmers dispensed with, and supplies
can be taken on board in midocean and in
rough weather. Tha evaporative power of the
oil is weight for weight superior to that of
coal, and anally the smoke and flamo fxom
the funnels are barely perceptible when once
the draught Is adjusted.
Fleet Engineer Burnett of H. B. M. ship
Blake, ia charge of the engine-room of that
ship when a fireman was scalded to death
through an accident to the boilers, was
charged with manslaughter by the Coroner's
jury. The crown, however, has set the ver
dict aside ahd he is now to be tried by court
martial for neglect of duty.
Rear-Admiral Fournier of the French navy
has prepared a naval programme of a very
revolutionary kind, but which has much to
recommend Its adoption. Part oi the scheme
carried into effect is the assignment oi three
armored cruisers as a "superior naval school,"
to which officers of marked ability in special
branches will be ordered for a course of prac
tical training. His scheme also contemplates
a permanent cruising fleet at sea oi 117 war
vessels, besides about 300 torpedo-boats. He
estimates the yearly cost of construction at
$15,000,000-, to continue for twenty-five years,
at the end of which time the fleet will consist
of the most recent improvements in ships,
machinery, armament and other appliances.
The Chilean Government recently sent out
a circular letter offering to gunners and boat
swains in the British navy who possess mas
ter's certificates $90 a month to join the
Chilean navy. The purpose is to place these
officers in charge of torpedo-boats and teach
Chilean sailors how to handle them.
The French cruiser Alger recently beat tho
British steamer Empress of China by two
hours In the run from Kobe to Yokohoma. The
Alger is of 4122 tons displacement ana 8000
horsepower, while the Empress of China is
about 8000 tons and 10,000 horsepower. The
Alger's trial speed was 19.5 knots.

in favor of McKinley, and the Bryan men in
sist on getting big odds against their candi
date. In ail the betting centers there is plenty
of money to stake on the Republican side, and
all offers made by Fopocrats are quickly cov
ered. The greatest difficulty encountered by
the betting conitngent up to date is that all
tne money is on the same side, and that it is
not easy to place large sums on the general
result.
The , odds , in â¢ McKtnley's â¢ favor vary mate
rially, but , are rarely lower j than ; 5 to 2, and
are sometimes quoted â¢ 5 to ;1. Most of the
uwney ventured uuring the last week has been
on results in different States or cities. In for
mer elections bets have been made on the size
of the Democratic plurality in this city. This
year the question is, Which party will fret a plu
rality? lJ llm an & Kan kin, bootmakers, who
nave studied the situation all over the coun
try, have posted the following betting odds on
local results: ~.

majority in the electoral college. The betting
in each case is that the candidate named will
carry the State, not that it will go against him.
WHERE THE TREASURE IS.
Stockton Independent.
The Examiner on Wednesday pleaded that
the Hearst mines were for the most Dart gold
properties and yesterday's Call admits it, but
shows that three silver mines are included.
One of these has paid $9,000,000 in dividends
and is valued at $525,030 80; another is
valued at $1,226,678, and the third $10,181 20,
besides other silver mining stocks not speci
fied. The Call calculates that if free coinage
should work as the silverites hope it will the
Hearst income would be increased iHOO.OOO a
year Now arises the qnestion: Who would
lose what Mr. Hearst would gain? The out
put of the mines would not be increased, but
the hope is ttat the price of the product would
advance. _ .
The only showing the silver men make to
this effect is that the stamp of the Govern
ment and the legal tender quality Imparted to
silver by converting bullion into coin would
have th*at effefct. Tuis would be to leave the
bullion of the same value, but all the owner
wou'd have to do would be to have it coined
and tho same amount of coin would pay twice
as much of debt or wages as would a like
amount of bullion. If this would work, as the
Brvanites insist it would, then every ounce of
bullion would be rushed to the mints to have
its value doubled, the owners would pay out
nothing but silver, everybody else would fol
low the example, gold would disappear and
the single silver standard would be here
of its own force. It is no wonder the Examiner
ROB V. ROBERTSON, Editor and Proprietor of the Piacerville
Daily " Nugget," Now on a Visit Here.
\Sketched from life by a "Call" artist.]
has changed in one short year from a gold
standard paper to a rampant free silverite:
"Where a man's treasure is, there is his heart
also."
TRUE SADNESS OF AUTUMN.
I cannot share the moan tney made,
Those poets of the olden time,
Who wept to see the flowers fade
Beneath the breath of autumn's rime.
Xo sympathy is In my breast
for grieviugs vain o'er fallen leaves,
Or sickly screeds of vague unrest
Which every autumn poet weave*.
The frosty season never brought
One throb of honest sorrow till
Sbirt waists were added to the lot
Of lovely things the frosts must kin.

LADY'S WAIST WITH SCALLOPED
ELGES OVER FULL VEST.
A delightfully simple waist, suitable alike
for silk, wool or velvet, Is pictured here. The
back is smooth over the shoulders with the
fullness gathered at the waist line over a fitted
lining. The front is also smooth at the top
over a fitted lining, which fastens in the cen
ter, the full vest hooking under the edge of the
left front. The crush collar ends join a tiny
frill, the ends of deep belt being finished at the
center back in the same way.
A waist of dark blue basket cloth had a vest
of orange velvet: the scallops were bound with
gilt braid, edged with a flat band of heavy
white lace.
A dress of fancy silk in petunia color had a
vest of pale yellow eh iff on ; the edges of the scal
lops were finished with a narrow band of pas
sementerie in several shades of yellow.
A waist of black velvet had sleeves of Dlack
mousseline de Â»oie over bright green silk. The
vest was of the same, and the scallops v,-ere
bound with green silk. A narrow band of jet
was set at the edge of the binding. The collar
and belt were of green, the latter overlaid with
motifs in jet, the former havinar a full ruche of
black mousselina de soie set ia'the top.
AROUND THE CORRIDORS
Robert V. Robertson, journalist and politi
cian a former Bohemian and great favonta
among the Bohemians of this City because of
his qualities as an entertainer, is at the Russ.
Mr. Robertson is now the editor and proprietor
of a live daily paper, called the Nugget, in
Piacerville, El Dorado County. The burden
of Mr. .Robertson's conversation now Is his
town and county, the progress and life of thÂ«
| farmer and the inexhaustible resources of the
| latter.
"I don't believe I am speaking disparag
ingly of other mining counties in thii
State of ours when I say El Dorado stands sec
ond to none in great mineral resources, de
veloped and undeveloped," said he, cutting
the tip from a iresh cigar. "You know we
are on the mother lode, the richest gold min
ing belt we believe in the United States. Now
remember I am not talking up a mining town,
for that is about the most fatal thing tbat can
happen to any good substantial mining
country, as it is productive of speculators in
stead of investors, and there is a great differ
ence between two. I can assure you. As it
now Is up there men are taking hold of prop
erties for the purpose of working them for
all there is in them, instead of making a hole
in the ground and then trying to sell a mine
winch may or not be there.
"Among the most important of the deais this
year was the recent sale of the Gentle Annie
group of mines, situated about three miles
out of Piacerville. The property was pur
chased by T. T. Lane and others at a large
figure, and the conditions of sale make it
incumbent upon the purchasers to sink two
large compartment shafts and mine the prop
erty thoroughly. This, of course, means a
good deal in the way of employment to men
and the circulation of money. We all have tha
satisfaction of knowing it is a good group oi
mines.
"A number of the old properties are being
taken hold of and pushed. With the modern
machinery and mining appliances rock that
did not pay in the early days can now be
â worked at a very large profit, and the old
abandoned bonanzas of other days are proving
veritable bonanzas again under this new de
velopment. We are blessed up there, too, with
fine timber and plenty of it, together with lota
of water, all very close to the properties, and
every miner will tell you what a saving such
conveniences are.
"Placerville? Well, the town keeps movrng
ahead all the time, naturally under the
impetus given it by mining developments.
Perhaps as good an illustration of its growth is
seen in this fact. When I went there about
eight months ago there were a few vacant
houses in the town, but only a few and not all
ot them desirable. Now I know of at least six
families there who cannot obtain houses ia
which to live and who are stopping at hotels
awaiting the erection of houses. The sound ot
the hammer and the saw has been incessant
almost for the t>ast year. Oh, yes, Piacervilla
is getting a good, healthy, steady growth.
"How is it going politically? Well, now,
that is a poser. El Dorado has always inclined
to the Democracy. But that was the regular
old Democracy. Whether this new organiza
tion will attract them lam in doubt I have
been stumping the country a little and lean
tell you as a good hard-shell Republican that I
feel encouraged. I think perhaps if the elec
tion had been held a few days after the Chicago
convention the whole country would have
voted for Bryan, but the people have been,
thinking since then, and while the inclinations
of the country are in the direction of friendli
ness for silver the people are beginning to dis
cover that after all the Republican party ia
the best friend of that metal. I have no fear
of the result. If we concentrate our efforts
now in the direction of electing Republican
Congressmen to hold up the hands of McKin
ley we shall make the victory all the more]
certain."

The visiting Episcopalian prelates de
livered sermons yesterday at St. Steven's,
St. Paul's, St. Luke's and St. Peter's.
Bishop Johnson spoke at St. Steven's.
He took for his text the following: "And
without faith it is impossible to please
him"â Hebrews, xi:6. Ttie Bishop in the
course of his sermon said :
"Faith is the dominating influence in
the world. It is conviction, and convic
tion is the thing that shapes our lives.
It gives the variety of expression to ihe
human face, and some persons have a
beliet' (hat by concentration of thought
all matter is under the domination of
the human will."
Hisbop Leonord spoke at St. Paul's. His
text was, "Who Is My Neighbor?"â St.
Luke, x:29. The Bishop set forth the ele
ments of neighborhood ness. He|said that
this did not constitute nearness of resi
dence, but a necessity of sympathy and
love.
Bishop Barker delivered a sermon at
i?t Luke's. His subject was, "The Law of
Growth and Deterioration as Seen in the
Physical Life Applied to the Spiritual"â
St. Peter, v:10.
The substance of the Bishop's sermon
was in illustration of the words, "Be ye
perfect."
He gave a number of scientific illustra
tion! and a quotation from Darwin, in
which Darwin said: "Ha had lost the
power to appreciate poetry, music and art
because he had cot used these faculties."
Bishop Kendrick spoke at SU Peters on
"Our duty to God, to our neighbors and
ourselves"â St. Matthew, xxii :38.
In the evening a special musical service
was given at Grace Church.

PARK AND BEACH
There Wan an Immense Number of
People Out Enjoy ng the
Fine Day.
It has been many a Sunday since there
was such a number of people at the park
ana at the ocean beach as yesterday. The
walks, drives and resting-places in the
park were crowded with all classes of
"people, woo were out enjoying the de
lightful day; all the seats in Concert Val
ley were occupied by lovers of music, who
were cbarmed with the several numbers
rendered by the band. Those numbers
that attracted the ereatesi attention and
won the most applause were "I Masna
rtieri," and variations on the picolo by A.
Logar, and Sousa's "Three Quotations" â
"The King of France," "I, Too. Was Born
in Arcadia" and "In Darkest Africa."
In the conservatory hundreds admired
a new orchid which is now in bloom. It
is known botanically as the OJontaglos
sone Grandi, but in common English it is
"the baby plant." In the center of the
blossom there is a perfect representation
in miniature of a Chinese baby, "and
there is not a lady who views it," said
Head Gardener Holbrow, "who does not
exclaim, 'How perfect.' "
Stow Lake was alive with boats and
rowers as it had not been for a long time,
and rowing was an enjoyable exercise,
the majority of those at the oars being
ladies.
Almost every one who owns a bicycle
was on his or her wheel, many in groups.
They were cut getting in shape for the
parade to-night.
The Grant monument is still covered,
and there is no knowing when it will be
unveiled. It appears that some time ago
a well-known citizen promised to donate
$500 toward erecting the monument, but
before a call was made for tbat amount he
died, and as he did not leave any provi
sion in bis will to meet that obligation the
executors do not feel called upon to pay
it. It is said that it is a matter of $500
tbat keeps the cloth on the monument
The work of rearranging the museum
is advancing and the installation of the
many exhibits will be commenced this
week. Director-General dejYoung, wno
recently returned from Europe full of
museum ideas, was a visitor to the place
yesterday, making many suggestions.
The ocean beach for more than a mile
was lined with people inhaling the salt
sea air, and in the baths there were many
thousands being amused by the antics of
the professional swimmers and races by
amateurs.
The cars of the Sutro line were taxed to
their capacity, and were running on
three-minute headway.

At 8 o'clock yesterday morning they
boarded the Vigilant of the Spreckels tug
line and Captain Randall took them
swiftly down the bay and out through the
Golden Gate.
After they had seen to it that the baskets
of sandwiches and cases of beer were
safely stowed on board the fishers, as they
went sailing out in the west, as the sun
went high, to.J miraculous tales of catches
along silvery lorest streams. Each man's
story was better than the preceding one,
and the annals of domestic fishery grew in
grandeur.
While the historians narrated the Vigi
lant was drawing near the bar. Presently
the tug's forefoot stood on the lir.-t swell
and the body of the vessel went down,
down in the trough of the sea and the
feelings of the fishermen came up, up
until great reaches of time and distance
seemed to lie between tug and passenger.
The sea was unusually rougn, and old
voyagers who had sailed unwittingly
over the ocean bowed down on the low
rail of the tug and poured out libations to
the deep. A heartless wagâ one of the
few who escaped, looked over the scene of
human woe and murmured: "One by
one the roses fall, one by one they fade and
die." His quotation was nttinc, but the
sufferers on their knees prayed that he
would fall overboard.
When the Vigilant got into the compar
atively smooth water under the iea of the
i< arallon light most of the stricken party
so far recovered as to get their lines over
board and go a-tishin*.
Some, however, did not take the trouble
to b3it their hooks, but sat in their places
and turned sad, lingering eyes toward the
tiny yellow dot of island before them.
The strong wind would soon drift the tug
off the cod bank and out into rough water,
where tne terrible sickness would come
over them again, and the fishlmes would
swinsr. many of them, unattended. But
the Vigilant in quiet water, they would
brace ud and take hold of their tackle
again.
They were heroes every one of them.
They all seemed to develop a desire for
lunch, and would desert their lines for
the eatables. Consequently when the
tish on tiie bank were not biting well the
fishers on deck, led by Judge Frank
Murasky. School Director Barrett and
Dr. Hill were biting well into the store of
sandwiches.
Supervisor Dimond with his mayoralty
bumblebee buzzing industriously in his
hat told with a candiaate's unction vivid
stories of the stormy main which went
far to mitigate the miseries of the seasick.
Two camera fiends had some way drifted
into the company and when a luckless
lisher would fall prostrate they would take
a snapshot at him and preserve the scene
of his distress for all time.
When the party reached the Ciiy on
their return they mustered just an even
dozen of fish as their day's uooking and
out of this number Dr. Barrett lost his
string overboard as he was walking up
the gang-plank from the tug. * But they
got a lot of valuable sea experience if lit
tle fish.
SAW THE SERPENT.
Commodore O'Riley and Party Had a
Gay Fishing Trip on tha
Buy.
Colonel R. J. O'Riley and his salt-water
disciples of rockeqd and divers kinds of
cod embarked yesterday morning on the
good ship Brisk for a fishing trip to the
principal "yanking" grounds on the bay.
A visit was paid to Devils Point, where
Old Nick was played with the denizens of
the deep. Then Fort Point was touched.
In fact every point on the bay where sea
fishes congregate on Sunday was visited
by the gay and festive Waltomans.
Amonc the party were: T. Cline, Abe
Kohlman, J>l. Barney, William Schutzler,
J. Durkin, B. Lennon, E. Dailey, Pete
Ahem, a protege of G. B. Martiu, and
otheis, who were so enthused over fishes
and fish feed that they forgot to leave
their signatures with the colonel of the
fishing staff.
Great sport was enjoyed, however, and
many cods wbich had seen better days
were displayed in evidence last evening
at Commodore Ferguson's angling resort
on Market street.
Colonel O'Riley states positively that he
had seen the much-talkeJ-of sea serpent
with a silver dollar in its mouth swim
niinjr at an enormous rate of speed to
wards Hearst's Point in Sausalito, but
Captain Cline is of the opinion that the
commodore was mistaken, as at the time
the serpent was seen O'Riley was engaged
in feeding fishes which had gathered
around the craft in anticipation of a holi
day mess.
Fish are said to be close observers, and
when they had seen the silvery color of
the commodore's face they concluded
that it was only a question of time when
O'Riley would disgorge, and they guessed
correctly.
'â¢This should be conclusive evidence,"
said Mr. Cline, "tbat the white metal Has
a sickly appearance, which is portrayed
only in the faces of those who are bilious
and in need of protection."

Had a Quick Voyage From Bering
Sea Driven by Northwesterly
Winds.
Owing to the pleasant weather yesterday
there were an unusually large number of
excursions to different points on the bay.
The Hetty B and the Amy both took out
fishing parties. George A. Knight went
out in his Athlete for a spin and "Warren
& Malley's Dirigo carried a party out for
a pleasure trip. There were also quite a
number of visitors to the Comanche, the
naval reserve boat.
i'esterday afternoon the British ship
Rahane, from Newcastle, was towed in
front of the Folsom-street wharf. She
came with a good gait across the Pacific,
making the run in 54 days. She carries a
cargo of 24C2 tons of coal. Captain Collins
reports she met variable winds on her pas
sage until within 200 miles of this coast,
when she encountered a strong northwest
wind tbat carried away some of her sails.
The bark Oakland came down from
Oakland creek in the afternoon. She has
been lying up there for the past year and
will be taken to the Spear-street dock to
be painted. Tne Peru sailed for Europe
loaded with wheat, and the Norwegian
tramp steamer Lyderhorn, with a cargo of
pram, sailed for Antwerp. The bark Louis
Pasteur came down from Vallejo City yes
terday and anchored in the stream. The
bark Leon sailed lor Mexico and the Agre
mont Castle was taken from the Lombard
street wharf and sent on her way to Port
Costa, where she will receive a cargo of
wheat for Europe.
Early yesterday morning the gasoline
schooner Duxbury, bound out on a fishing
excursion for the Farallon Islands, col
lided with the scow schooner Anna,
which was anchored near Meiggs Wharf.
The Anna had her bowsprit carried com
pletely away ana the entire upper bul
warks of the Duxbury were torn out.
Frank Lloyd, a boy aboard the Duxbury,
had his right hand severely crushed, so
badly, in fact, that amputation of his
hand may bo necessary.
The acting revenue cutter Walter
Hackett was also ill "tarred. She ran into
the Merchants' Exchange boaraing offi
cer's boat, badly damaging it.
The sealing schooner Lucy D came into
port yesterday morning. She was only
two weeks on her voyage from Bering Sea.
She has been out since last February, and
reports a catch of 689 seals for the season.
She spoke the sealing schooners Alton
and Rattler near Alaska. They were on
the point of starting lor this port.
A report was around the front that the
Lucy D was seized while in the Bering Sea
by Government cutters. This the mate
denies. He says that nothing of any in
terest occurred daring the voyage.
About 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon an
unknown drunken man wandering about
on the schooner Novo, lying at Mission
street wharf No. 1, fell overboard. People
standing near witnessed his trouble and
threw planks and ropes to him, but he
was unable to help himself and was
drowned. The body was found by Harry
Johnson, a boatman.

RYAN DISCOURSES
ON INDEPENDENCE
Tells the Kind of Declaration
This Country Greatly
Needs.
Says National Holidays Have
Degenerated Into Days ior
Bicycle Parades.
QUnZOWGIVÂ£S FAIR WARNING
Will Not Longer Quietly Submit to
Boisterous Cheering and Taunt
ing Hisses.
Major T. C. Ryan was again the magnet
at Metropolitan Temple yesterday after
noon. The attendance was not nearly so
large as usual, but what was lacking in
numbers appeared to be more than made
up in boisterous enthusiasm, Mr. Ryan
was repeatedly cheered to the echo, and
he seemed to enjoy the pleasant inter
ruptions fully as much as those partici
pating.
Chairman Quitzow in his opening re
marks took occasion to wain those present
that interruptions, hisses, etc., sucu as
had been attempted during the past three
or four Sundays would not be tolerated.
"All are welcome," he said, "but this is
our meeting and we propose to that it is
properly respected. We have force enough
to back up what I say, though I should
regret very much to be compelled to eject
any one."
"The Second Declaration of Independ
ence" was the subject selected by the
speaker f3r tie afternoon talk. Among
other things he said:
"The world's great Republic was born
120 years ago* The world had never seen
the "like before, and it probably never will
again. The world was looking on that
early Colonial Congress with high expect
ancy, and En land, of which we hear so
much in latter days, was trembling in every
fiber. We fought for and gained our inde
pendence, whicii gave us perfect liberty of
thought and religion."
Mr. Ryan then described the first Decla
ration of Independtnce, saying that we
had started this Government in a sort of
contradiction. He referred to the fact
that the Supreme Court, headed by a
Romanist, had decided that the negro had
no rights which the white man was bound
to respect. Yet this indignity had been
wiped out by the best blood in the land.
He referred to those who had participated
in drawing the Declaration of Independ
ence, saying that they could not have
seen the eoing of Satolli or the coming of
Martinelli. Continuing ne said:
"The Catholics have the audacity to tell
us that Lord Baltimore was the first to
establish religious liberty in this country,
but we know this to be a gigantic false
hood. The merest tyio knows that it was
Roger W illiams. The 30r.h day of May,
which is the most sacred day of the year,
has degenerated into a day of bicycle
parades and baseball games. Take tt;e
22d of February. We do not associate it
with the trials and hardships of Washing
ton and his innumerable victories, but
rather with Washington's little hatchet
and the cherry tree.
''Now wecometothis new Declaration of
Independence. I would have our children
trained in the great American college â
our free public schools. 1 would have
them instructed by American teachers,
and then there would be no time for mak
ing rosaries or crosses. I would have
this second declaration compel every for
eigner to take the oath of allegiance and
the oath of supremacy. You know that
Lord Baltimore could not become a citi
zen of Virginia because he could or would
not take the oath of supremacy, and why?
Because it denied the supreme authority
of the Pope and no man can serve two
masters, and this is a statement which
needs no proof. 1 '
Major Ryan then turned his attention
to the Catholic church. He said it was
t,e most dangerous organization to man
kint to-day in the world. The spealcer
rapidly skipped over the alleged short
comings of the church, referring particu
larly to the charge that the whisky men
were mostly Catholics. He s:iid that he
would have this second Declaration of In
dependence remedy all these evils, and
make all citizens good American citizens.
HANDBALL COURTS.
P. T. HoiiiicUv, Amateur Champion,
and SI. J. ilgallon, Defeat T. I .
Bonnet and I). Connolly.
The attendance nt the handball courts
yesterday was very good and several ex
citing games were witnessed. At the San
Francisco Court the chief attraction was
a game in which P. T. Donnelly, the
aniiteur champion, and M. J. Kilgallon
played against T. F. Bonnet and D. Con
nolly. It was an easy victory for Don
nelly and Kilgallon, who won in three
straight games. M. McNeil and J. Mc-
Donald played a rattling game against
Phil Ryan and J. Rodgers, and won
chiefly tnrough the fine service of McNeil.
The event of the day at the Union court
was a game in which J. J. Feeney and J.
Nelson played against R. Linehan, the
overhand " â wiper," and J. Collins. It
was closely contested from start to finish
and the final was won by Feeney and Nel
son by two aces. Terry McManns, the
heavy-weight champion, has almost re
covered from his illness and was able to
take part in a game yesterday. He and R.
Shields defeated J. O'Donnell and J.
Roger after an exciting struggle.
The Eureka court, in the Mission, has

-.". Explanation.
The arrow file* with the wind. The top flguroa
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
days; those underneath it. if any, the amount of
raintall, of melted snow in Inches and hundredths,
during the past twelve hours. ' Isobars, or solid
lines, connect pom s of equal air pressure; Iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "high" means hlÂ«h barometric pressure and
is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
ri'fers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" us ally first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high in the interior
and low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low". Is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result.

An Alameda Inventor Would

ANYTHING TO DOWN DAVIE.
The Mayor Declares the Legislature,
Not the Council, Shou d Handle
the Mi k Question.
Oakland Office Sak Francisco Call.)
908 Broadway, Oct. 4. J
Some ladies of this city are trying to
discover why the character of a female
witness in the courts should be so fre
quently assailed for no othei purpose than
to help a second-class lawyer bolster up a
weak case.
One of the women in the very front rank
of active workers in Oakland expressed
herself very forcibly on this question yes
terday. "I have noticed," she said, "that
no matter for what purpose a woman may
be a witness, there is among a certain
class of lawyers, a certain cruel and unpro
fessional delight apparently taken, in hu
miliating such a witness before a crowded
and depraved lobby, *uch as invariably
hang around courtrooms. I have seen
the most irreproachable of women, some
of them wives and mothers, insulted in
such a subtle manner that the Judge
could hardly interfere without an appear
ance of prejudice.
"A lovely little woman was in court a
few days ago. She had the misfortune to
be the wife ot an unprincipled iellow who
was doing his best to avoid the responsi
bility of keeping his children. Af er a
whisper with the father the attorney
asked: 'Are all these children your hus
band's?' The witness did not at once
grasp the question, and then followed oth
er?, such as 'Do you know Mr. ?'
'Did you ever go out with him?' and sim
ilar cruel insinuations, and when the little
mother left the stand she was so humili
ated that she went into the witness-room
and cried herself hysterical. The mis
chief had been done, and tbe lobby and
the jury had been given a cruel and false
impression. This is only one case, but
dozens of others have come under my im
mediate notice."
The ladies who are trying to infuse
manhood into unprincipled attorneys
have undertaken a hard task. In Oak
land, as in all other cities, the Police
Court practitioner does not legally re
quire a diploma, and as a rule he only
knows enough about the rule of evidence
to keep himself out of contempt of court,
although he does not know enough of
decency to keep himself out of the con
tempt of the public. Since Harry Melvin
was appointed Public Prosecutor this
class of "attorney" has often been made
to feel sorry that he spoke, but unfortu
nately Mr. Melvin's services are some
times required outside of the Police Court,
and his absence is generally taken ad
vantage of. Judge Wood is in no way
lacking in gallantry, but be is a Judge
and bis hands are somewhat tied. Until
men will be decent because it is right,
women witnesses will continue to be
legally insulted.
The Alameda man who has invented a
machine that will show who is at the
other end of a telephone must expect to
meet with great opposition. When his in
vention shall have become common it
will rob the telephone of all its rcmance
and will reduce it to the level of an ordi
nary element of commerce and society.
The latitude at present enjoyed because
there may be a mistake as to who is at the
other end, will be a thing of the past. The
frequently practiced deception of imitat
ing anotner person's vo.ee and thereby
preventing a po-sible unpleasantness,
must cease. The chagrin of finding that
you are talking to another lady when you
thought you were addressing your wife,
will no longer be felt. All these and
many other contretemps will be avoided,
and indirectly the new machine may
prove to be a moral force.
It remains to be seen just what tbe effect
of tbe invention will be, but City Clerk
Lamborn has divulged some, and it is the
privilege of the public to guess the, rest.
They are busily doing so and there are
not a few who predict that the present
frivolous generation will have passed away
before sight can be made to travel as fast
as sound over the 'phone.
Mayor Davie has made a discovery. He
has found out that men who are honest in
business, honest in their private life and
good citizens who would scorn to do any
meanness, can be ruined by politics. He
has received proof, he says, that men will
do anything to farther their political am
bition. Of course at this time his Honor's
remarks apply to the City Council and the
Board of Health. The former body is
fighting the Mayor over the tax levy, and
the latter is most interested in the tuber
culin test ordinance. Regarding the milk
legislation the Mayor's argument is un
doubtedly fair. He has stated that the
question of testing milk and of inoculat
ing cows is not a matter for local legisla
tion. It is of as much importance in one
part of the State as another, and is a mat
ter with which the legislature should
deal. It being a very serious matter to
destroy a herd of cows aDd probably ruin
a man's business, the Mayor Delieves that
such work should not be the result of a
few experiments of a local veterinary doc
tor. "In less than three months," said
Mayor Davie to-day, "the Legislature will
meet and this matter will bo thoroughly
handled. It is not a subject for a <ew doc
tors and a horse-doctor to deal with.
"There will probably be a bill passed
authorizing the appointment of a com
mission of scientific men to examine into
the tuberculin test. We have gone all
these years without any apparent evil,
and it cannot make much difference if we
wait and deal with the matter intelli
gently. I doubt very much whether a
municipal ordinance can be made with
such power. Heavy damage suits would
certainly be brought against the city of
Oakland, and no other city can afford to
run any such risks. These men who are
trying to railroad this ordinance through
would, if they followed their consciences,
express views similar to my own, but it is
anything to down Davie, and as I bave
vetoed the ordinance they will pass it, if
possible, by fair means or foul. And
this is politics." 8. W. B.

CARING FOR THE WAIFS.
Eadeavorers Will Undertake It
It the Ministers Do Not
Object.
A Committee Appointed to Obtain
Practical Information and to
Make a Report.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Oct. 4. f
The subject of caring for the waifs of the
city was taken up at the First Chris
tian Church to-night, and the matter
was, after discussion, postponed till the
special committee of the City Christian
i Endeavor Union shall make its report.
At the monthly meeting of the City
Union, the communication from Chief of
\ Police Lloyd was brought forward and
| discussed. There were four pastors pres
! ent, and nearly every society was rep
resented.
The suggestions of the Chief of Police were
heartily approved, but no decisive action
I could be taken because there were so few
i pastors present, and nothing cou.d bedene
without their consent. A committee, with
Miss Bertha Ciift as chairman, was ap-
I pointed to get the facts as to tne necessity
j for such work being done, as to what is
! being done in other places and as to wnat
tne cost oi such an institution would be.
Tbe facts will be presentea to the Min
isterial Union of Oakland, and if that
body advises that the Endeavours take
charge of tbe work the committee was in
structed to report at the next meeting a
plan for caring for OaKland waifs. The
funds for this work wiil have to be raised
by subscription, as the C. E. Union has
no power to levy asses>ments.
Tbe following resolutions were passed:
Rctolved, That the Christian Endeavor Union
of the city of Oakland Indorse the suggestions
and communication of Chief oi Police C. E.
Lloyd that something of a practical and help
lu nature ought to be done for the waifs of
Oakland; and
Basolvtd, That we pledge our hearty support
i to the committee appointed to devise ways
I nnd means by -which these children can be
i fed and clothed and housed and taught of the
loving friend, Jesus, iv whose great loving
heart they bave all a place.

A BAD RUNAWAY
An Aged Couple Thrown
Down a Bank Near
Haywards.
The Lady's Arm Is Broken and
Both Received Internal
Injuries.
EFFECT OF BRIGHT KIBBONS.
Frightened tho Horse?, but the Wheel
men Made No Effort to Prevent
the Accident
Oakland Office San Francisco C*ll.)
908 Broadway, Oct. 4. J
An accident occurred on Castro Hill,
near Haywards, to-Jay that may end
fatally.
Mr. and Mr?. William Garrido were
driving toward Palomares Canyon, when
they met two cyclists who had streamers
of bright ribbons flyinp from the handle
bars of their wheel*. As they approached
the horses the animals became restive, and
Mr. Garrido, wno was driving, tried his
best to check them, but he was not strong
enough. If the cyclists noticed the fright
of the horses they made no effort to help
matters, but kept on riding, and when
they were almost abreast of the animals
tbe riders pa: on a spurt and thoroughly
scared the borses.
Tbe wheelmen rode on and d ; d not stop
to see the effect of their thoughtlessness.
Tne borses became w.ld and bolted, and
the old couple in the wagon were helpless
to restrain them. On they dashed, and at
several places where the road was rough
the wagon was tilted up and the occu
pants thrown from one side of the seat to
the other.
The canyon road is very uneven in
places and some sections have ravines on
either side. The animals rus ed on, and
as tbey were approaching a part of the
road where there is a steep bank Garrido
and his wife bot grasped the reins, but
they were unable to check the wild career
of tne horses. The wagon approached the
point of danger, the horses swerved and
the occupants were thrown down the
bank.
Others driving along the road saw the
accident and hurried to the relief of the
victims. Garrdo's bead was badly cut
anu bruised and was bleeding freely, and
he com plained of other injuries, although
he was partly unconscious.
Mrs. Gurriiio was badiy hurt. Her right
arm is broken and she is badly cut, and
it is feared that both are injured in
ternally. '1 be Garriaos were taken to a
doctor's and attended to, but the report
of their condition is very unfavorable and
it cannot yet be told wbat tbe result
may be.
Mr. and Mrs. Garrido are well-to-do
ranchers and are both advanced in years,
which militates aeainst their chances or
recovery. The wagon was smashed and
tbe horses scratched, but not badly.
Nothing was heard of tbe cyclists after
they had frightened the horses.

booths all did a merry business. - <:

rendered a pretty song. : : The remainder

the booths.
The tobes worn by the Speaker of the

The Union-square Market building is owned

to have the premises ready for the market
men by October 1, and Mr. Toy succeeded in
iulfl ling his contract, much to ihe satisfaction
of all concerned.
There is much to be done yet before tne
buildirg is completed, but it is in the two up

months to complete the structure. The m:ir

feet on O'Farrell. It fa lighted in the rear dur

main entrance is on Powell street, and pre

six stories, should it be deemed desirable later
to increase tbe height. The Union-square
Market has cost more than was at first esti
mated, and will approximate $50,000.

shooting at a jackknife when Officer E. L.
McDonald appeared, thinking that an at
tack was being made upon the Chinese of
that locality. He gathered them in and
took them to the City Hall, where they
gave the names ot Henry Meyers and John
Huns, and deposited $5 bail each and
promised to appear Tuesday morning for
trial.
Used a Knife.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Oct. 4.â John Sill of
Oakland applied at the police station this
afternoon for an officer to go with him to
ascertain why a certain unknown man
had attacked him with a knife. He said
he was on Santa Clara avenue, near Cot
tage street, when the fellow began calling
him names, to which he objected. He
cautioned the man to quit and reached
lor a stone when he was driven off at the
point of a knife. He was advised to
swear to a complaint and have his assail
ant arrested.

NATIONAL GUARD
OF CALIFORNIA.
The staff of Major-General N. T. James,
division commander of the National
Guard, has been examined according to
regulations and is now duly commissioned.
The commissions came from Sacramento
last week.
The staff officers are: John C. Currier,
colonel and assistant adjutant-general;
John Gallwey, colonel and surgeon;
George Stone, lieutenant-colonel and
engineer officer; George R. Burdick,
lieutenant-colonel and quartermaster;
Thomas Ciuff, lieutenant-colonel and
commissary; James Smith, lieutenant
colonel and judge- advocate; D. E. Miles,
lieutenant-colonel and signal officer;
Fred F. Follis, lieutenant-colonel and
paymaster; J. H. Mangels, lieutenant
colonel and ordnance officer; George H.
Pippy, lieutenant-colonel; W. B. Hooper,
major and A. D. C; F. S. Pott Jr., major
and A. D. C; Willis Docid, major and
A. D. C.
The commander- in- chief, Governor
Budd, visited the City recently. He went
to the fair of the Mechanics' Institute last
Friday night, accompanied by several
members of his staff.
Adjutant-General A. W. Barrett has
been on the sick list for three weekÃ. He
is not emaciated, but is fifteen pounds
lighter than be was a month ago.
Colonel Robert L. Peeler, assistant
adjutant-general, was in San Francisco
last Saturday, and met many officers of
the First and Fifth Infantry at the Cali
fornia Hotel.
SECOND BRIGADE.
The active commissioned officers of the
Second Brigade formed an association last
Saturday night. Forty-three officers at
tended the meeting at the California
Hotel. The Fifth Infantry officers came
in fatigue uniform, according to the letter
order calling the meeting. The officers of
the First Infantry did not appear in
uniform. It was decided at the meeting
that officers would not hereafter be re
quired to appear at the business sessions
of the association in uniform.
The purpose of the organization formed
last Saturday night is to work for t,be in
terest of the guard in general and the Sec
ond Brigade in particular. In order to
obtain desired legislation at Sacramento
next winter it is clear that the officers
must work In harmony with each other.
It is said that the officers of the Fitth In
fantry who live in San Rafael, Santa Rosa
and Petaluma are in close touch with can
didates for the Legislature in these locali
ties. It has been suggested that National
Guard officers residing in San Francisco
should make the acquaintance of City
candidates for the Legislature and explain
what is needed to make the organization
effective. Possibly the Commander-in
chief, Governor Budd, may fancy that the
Legislature should be guided in military
legislation by recommendations which he
may submit in nis oiennial message to the
law-makers.
The Second Brigade Association ap
pointed a Legislative committee consist
ing of Lientenant-Colonel Dnboce. Major
Tilden and Captains O'Neil, Filmer and
Smith from San Francisco. The commit
tee W3s re-enforced by tta following con
sulting members from the country: -Colo
nel Fairbanks, Petaluma; Major Juilliard,
Santa Rosa; Lieutenant-Colonel A. K.
Whitton, San Jose; Major Hays, Oakland;
Captain Elliott, San Rafael, and Captain
Bush, Napa. General R. H. Warfield was
elected president of the association.
Company X, First Infantry, Captain
Thomas J. Cunningham, left the City Sat
urday afternoon for a three days' outing at
Guadeloupe Dairy farm. Silhouette tar
gets in imitation of the humau figure were
taken along. The men propose to do some
shooting m the field. T c company will
return to the City to-morrow evening.
Company F, First Infantry, Captain
John A. Miller, left the City Saturday for
a three days' outing at Stockton.
C. J. Evans, major and signal officer of
the Second Brigade, is in the field witn a
detachment of expert signalmen. He ex
pects to transmit a telegraph message
from Mount Hamilton via Mount Diablo,
Mount St. Helena and Tamalpais to San
Francisco.
Major C. H. Murphy, engineer officer
Second Brigade, presided at the election
of captain and lieutenants of Company M,
First Infantry, at the regimental armory
Friday evening last. Captain O'Neil and
Lieutenants Carroll and Hogan were re
elected.
Leave of absence for sixty days has been
granted to G. C. Boararaan Jr., captain
signal corps, second brigade.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Oct. 3.â One of the
banner companies of the Fifth Infantry
Regiment is Company E of Santa Rosa.
The attendance is unusually good and the
members take a deep interest in all that
pertains to military life. Last Monday
night the company enjoyed an extended
order drill upon the streets of this city.
Captain C. E. Haven was in command and
Major L. W. Juilliard directed the firing
exercises. The glittering uniforms and
brightiy burnished accoutrements flashing
in the bright moonlight was indeed a
pretty sight and attracted the attention of
hundreds of Santa Rosa citizens.
On Tuesday night the officers and non
commissioned officers gathered at the bar
racks for a study of tactics under the in
struction of Captain C. E. Haven.
The challenge of Company E for are
turn shoot has been accepted by Company
C of Petaluma, and the first of the series
will be held on the Company E range,
near this City, next Sunday.
Company E has many tine marksmen,
and with constant practice the entire
company is improving in their aim and
nerve.
Sergeant R. P. Smith and Corporal J.
W. Mailer are the holders of gold bars wonJ
in the last Slaie shoot, and Private John
Godman holds the record, for the regi
ment, with a score of 47. Unfortunately
the latter will not be able to compete, as
he is but slowly convalescing from a very
severe illness.
Company G, Fifth Infantry, Alameda,
is now minus a captain. The resignation
of Captain W. F. Chipraan has taken
effect. Before an election takes place
pome of the names on the company roll
may be dropped. The report comes from
Sacramento that some important changes
may be made in this company.
THIRD BRIGADE.
SACRAMENTO. Cal., Oct. 2.âCom
pany G has gone into encampment at
Woodland, and will put in the majority
of their time at target practice and drill,
and Company F of Woodland will join
them in their labors. This outing trip of
the company will by no means be a picnic,
as Captain Steams is one of the greatest
enthusiasts in all matters pertaining to
the advancement of the National Guard of
the State, and will insist on a strict per
formance of duty while in camp; although
a bit of a martinet still the captain is in
direct touch with his men, and fully
possesses their confidence and esteem,
and it is largely his personal influence
and thoroughness at drill that has
made the constant demand lor adiuitance
into the ranks of the company by out
siders. There is never a night that ap
plications are not received for member
ship in the company circles, and any of
those who fail to fill the requirements of
the service are dispensed with with short
notice.
There was a full attendance, at drill at
the last meeting of the company, drill du
ties devolving on Lieutenant Ottenger, as
Captain Steams was presiding at the
court-martial which had been called io
inquire into such charges as might be
preferred. At the conclusion of the drill
a number of applications for memoership
were read and acted upon, nnd roll was
called to ascertain how many wonld at
tend the outing of the company, nearly
sixty responding. Quartermaster Ser
geant Joe Kline, who is a general favorite
of the company, was directed to furnish
all tents, etc, necessary. The company
have purchased an entire new outfit of
the regulation Webb beits out of their
company funds, and hope to m::ke a good
showing at the targets. In practice the
company will shoot in squads of eight,
firing two shots at a diaiance of 800 yards,
and advancing at the double for 100
yards, tiring two more shots until the 200
--yard range is reached. Man targets will
be used and the shooting will be done in
three positions, standing, lying down and
kneeling, to be counted as follows: Stand
ing, 1 point; kneeling, 3 points; and pros
trate, 5 points.
SIGNAL CORPS.
The second semi-annual shoot of the
Signal Corps for the year was held on Sat
urday, the 26th of September, the follow
ing scores being made: Lieutenant Mar
tin 39, Sergeant Bailey 39, Sergeant Wat
kins 25. Corporal Cosby 39, Corporal Tay

26. Staff. Third Brigadeâ Major W. W.
Douglns 35, Serjeant-Major J. Alexander
22. Retired listâ Major A. P. Scheld 30.
The adjutant-general has called in the
old Colt and Smith <fc Wesson 45-oaliber
pistois and has issued the new Colt 38-eal
iber. Much more satisfactory results are
expected from the use of the lighter gun.
The corps will star; on Saturday night
at 8 o'clock, mounted, for Woodland, where
a tieid day wili beheld on Sunday, further
details of which will appear next week.
MERCED, Cax., SeDt. 30.â Last Friday
Company H, Sixth Infantry, held its sec
ond semi-annual target practice for the
current year. First Lieutenant P. H.
Medley of Modesto, the inspector of rifle
practice of the reeimpnt, supervised tne
practice. The day was bright and clear,
an ideal day for practice, except for a
short while in Jthe afternoon when short
puffy breezes somewhat bothered the men
at the firing stand. Forty men partici
pated in the competition and a number of
bronze tars will come to the company on
the result of the year's work at the tar
gets. The following men made scores of
36 and over: Griffith, 42; Bearwald 41;
Lieutenant Bambauer,39; Corporal Jones,
38; Serceant Gstrein, 37; Sergeant Potter,
37; Corporal Marshall, 37; Swan, 37;
George, 37; Lieutenant Smith, 36; Cor
poral Carson, 36; Deumude, 36.
The last regimental orders announce the
discharge of Sergeant Louis Gstrein, Cor
poral John K. Marshall, Privates Henry
I L. A.tken, Robert F. Atchison, Andrew
J. Brown, Jacob E. Carter and George W.
Farrar. The company now numbers fifty
four men, with several prospective re
cruits in sight. Sergeant Gutnrits re
enlisted on the 25th for another term of
three years. The sergeant is one of the
stayers in the service, having taken his
| first oath in 1882, since which time he has
I been continuously in the service in the
S ates of California, Illinois and Ken
tucky. The vacancies in the non-com
missioned corps Jof the company will be
increased next month by the discharge or
one sergeant and two corporals, whose
terms of enlistment have expired and who
nave applied for discharges. Their places
will be filled by men wlio have earned pro
motion by attention to duty and interest
in the service.
VISALIA, CaiÂ», Oct. 2.â Each and
every member of Company E shot his ten
rounds at the semi-annual shoot. Twen
ty-one made a score of 40 or better, 19
made 30 or better, 5 went under 20, Pri
vate Levy, by missing the bulkheads, ac
quired the leather medal. Average for
company, 33. For 1896, silver medals <
won, 12; bronze, 29. Next year several
members of Company E expect to carry
off several gold medals.
Captain Ward is in receipt of several
letters from officers in the Sixth, congrat
ulating him and his men for the splen
did showing at the shooting.
After the regular drill last Tuesday
evening the boys of Company E were in
vited to a supoer given to them by the
non-commissioned officers. "Frijoles con
queso" was the principal dish. While en
joying the supper the Visalia brass band
gave the boys a splendid surprise by a
serenade. The band was invited in to
partake of the spread, after which fol
lowed a smokei. "Then came a business
meeting to consider the acceptance of the
! invitation offered by Fresno to come and
! join them in their jubilee on the comple
tion of the Valley railroad to he hbid at
Fresno Monday, October 5. The invita
tion was heartily accepted and 50 men
answered the roll call to the affirmative
that they would go, whereupon the band
boys offered their services for the occa
sion, which was accepted with cheers.
The Visalia Delta says: The Btate
militia news published in the San Fran
cisco Call every Monday is watched witn
great interest by the boys in blue. Na
tional Guard news from all the Slate is
published and the militiamen know what
their fellow-soldiers are doing in other
parts of California. It is an interesting
feature of The Call.
Company E will go into camp Satur
day evening, October 10, for about twenty
four hours. The camp grounds are ad
jacent to the city and is an ideal earn pin e
ground among the large oaks. It will be
a camp of instruction. Guard mount,
squad, company, battalion and otner drills
will be executed.
Company E now has a social club, and
proposes to give literary and musical ex
erctees, to be followed by dancing, at least
once a month. October 16 is the date for
the initial event.
Lieutenant Bell, aid-de-camp on General
Forsyth's staff, U. S. A., arrived here on
Saturday evening, on a visit to Captain
Gale's camp.
The regular monthly drill for the Major
Berry medal will take place on Tuesday
evening, October 13.
Sunday, October 4, is the regular monthly
shoot for company medals.
TROOPS READY TO MOVE
Bids Opened for Transporting the
Fifth Artillery to New
York.
An Additional Allowance for the
Water Plant at the
Presidio.
The last faint glimmer of hope that the
Fifth Artillery wonld be permitted to re
main three years longer in California has
vanished. Last Saturday, Colonel Lee,
the depot quartermaster, opened bids from
the railroad companies for the transporta
tion of the men and officers of the regi
ment from this City to New York. The
Government subsidy roads, as well as
lines independent of Government aid, put
in proposals, The computation of the va
rious bids will be finished to-day. When
ail the figures are computed Colonel Lee
will be able to designate the route of
travel. It is understood that the South
ern Pacihc handed in a low bid.
In the barracks of the men and the quar
ters of the officers at Alcatraz, Fort: Mason
and the Presidio a deal of packing up for
the trip has already been clone. The order
contemplates that the regiment shall de
part on the 13th, and everything will be in
readiness for leaving on that day. At least
200 enlisted men of the regiment have
elected to remain at this post and accept
service in the Third Artillery. Twenty
peyen men belonging to Captain A. W.
Vogdes' Battery E. stationed at Fort Ma
son, have decided to'stay here. Twenty
one men of Battery A. Captain Ben jam fa
K. Roberts, will remain at the Presidio.
Twenty men belonging to Battery M, Cap
tain Day, will stay here.
General Graham's family will rem ain in
California and reside in this City. One
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY", OCTOBER 5, 1896.
boy is attending the State University and
another is at Trinity School. Captain
Roberts' wife will not go East at present,
but will live in Oakland with her sister for
several months. Captain Hill's family
will remain here for some time. Major
Darling and Captain Wood have applied
for transfers to enable them to remain at
the Presidio.
The regiments will be stationed in New
York in thisorder: General Graham, Major
Kenzie, Captain Roberts' Battery A, Cap-
Crabb's Battery H, Captain Hill's Battery
I and Captain Thorp's Light Battery D at
Fort Hamilton.
Lieutenant - Colonel Sinclair, Major
Darling, Captain Vogdes' Battery E, Cap
tain Morris' Battery X and Captain Mc-
Clellan's Battery L at Fort Wadsworth.
Major Tully " McCrea, Captain Wood,
Battery C; Captain Day, Battery M, and
Captain Lomia, Battery B, Fort" Slocum,
Davids Island.
It is uncertain where Captain Reilly's
Light battery F will go. It may be or
dered to Fort Sheridan, Chicago. Nine
teen men of Battery F and fifteen of Bat
tery D will stay at the Presidio.
Men who enli3ted in the East prefer to
remain at this post. When a soldier is
discharged he receives an allowance for
transportation to the place of enlistment
and also a day's pay for each twenty miles
traveled. So the soldier enlisted in New
York and discharged here gets his trans
portation and also five months' pay, under
the rule of a day's pay lor each twenty
miles. The law was passed before the era
of railroads.
Colonel Bainbridge of che Third Artil
lery, who Will doubtless succeed General
Graham in command at the Presidio, is
said to be a very pleasant and affable man,
who does not impose arduous duties on
the soldiers. Some people near the Pre
sidio have been wishing for a post com
mander to come who would allow dogs to
hunt and cows to pasture on the reserva
tion.
Last week Colonel A. S. Kimball, chief
quartermaster of the <lepartment, received
an authorization to expend $1600 to com
piete the new system of wells at the Pre
sidio. Colonel Kimbail is highly gratified
over the surcess of the well-boring.
The flow of water is so ample that the
reservation can be supplied by eight hours
pumping daily. This independent and
abundant water supply is regarded as an
elemruent of great strength to the post.
Major-Gpneral Miles, commanding the
army, was surprised and gratified over
the improvements at the Presidio.
First Lieutenant John D. Miley will not
go East with his regiment, but will re
main at the Presidio to arrange the dyna
mite guns. He is familiar with this im
portant branch of duty.
Lieutenant Sydney A. Cloman, First In
fantry, is now on duty at Fort Mason.
Lieutenant Louis P. Brant, First In
fantry, is on duty at department head
quarters in this City.
The Fox's Grape*.
The fox had jumped and jumped and
jumped. He sat down with his tongue
hanging out .and eyed the unattainable
grapes with a well assumed air of indiffer
ence.
"Dear me!" he remarked airily, "How
careless of me not to notice that they were
not edible trapes, but good to make into
table d'hote wine!" â Washington Star.

WAS IT POISON
OR STRONG DRINK?
Mrs. Anderson Dies Under
Most Peculiar Cir
cumstances.
Olficer Esken Reported to Dr.
Fitzgibbons That the Woman
Had Taken Poison.
DENIED BY THE SURGEON.
An Autopsy Will Be Held To-Day to
Determine the Actual Cause
of Death.
Mrs. Mary Anderson of 419 Harriet
street died at the City Prison last night
under most peculiar circumstances. If
the story told about the police headquar
ters is true, there is one more entry to be
made in the column of shortcomings al
ready credited to the management of the
Receiving Hospital.
About 2:40 o'clock yesterday afternoon
it was reported at the southern station
that Mrs. Anderson was lying helplessly
drunk at Her house on Harriet street.
Officer Esken was quietly dispatched to
the place, and after some difficulty pained
access to the house. He searched all the
front rooms, but without success. Finally,
as a last resort, Ksken directed his steps
to the kitchen, and on a sofa found Mrs.
Anderson apparently in a drunken stupor.
Within easy reach was a gallon can half
filled with stale beer, though the woman
bad already succumbed either to its po
tent influence or some powerful drug. It
is tnis that has brought the attendants at
the Receiving Hospital under the suspi
cion of having neglected their full duty.
Esken endeavored to arouse the woman,
but failed utterly. As there was a big
gash over the rigdt eye the officer thought
it likely that she was unconscious as the
result of a blow or fall, and accordingly
summoned the ambulance. Pending the
arrival vi this slow-moving vehicle, Esken
was informed by parlies occupying the
upper flat that the woman had taken
poison. She had been drinking heavily
of iate and on several occasions threatened
to taiie her life.
At the Receiving Hospital the wound
on the woman's head was dressed by Dr.
Frank Fitzgibbons, the surgeon in charge,
who immediately ordered Mrs. Anderson
taken to the City Prison. He said it was
simply a case of 'plain drunk."
At 6:15 o'clock Mrs. Anderson died in
the woman's ward at the City Prison.
She had been placed on a bench, and was
apparently incapable of movement. Sud
denly sne turned over, as if in pain, and
then rolled to the floor. Her ceiimate let
lortu a piercing shriek, which brought
Sergeant Shields auicsly to the scene,
though the woman had breathed her last
just before he reached her side.
It is generally believed that tbe woman
died of poison. Officer Esken swears he
told Dr. Fitzgibbons that Mrs. Anderson
had taken poison, but the surgeon insisted
on its being merely a case of "plain
4runk." On the other Land, Dr. Fitzgib
bons affirms that Esken said nothing
about poison, but, on the contrary, said
she had taken too mucii beer.
The body of Mrs. Anderson was removed
to the Morgue, where an autopsy will be
held to-day. If it is shown that she bad
swallowed poison Dr. Fitzgibbons will
probably find himself in a very embarrass
ing position.
Detectives Ryan and ODea were de
tailed on the case last nignt, and they
found certain facts that throw some light
upon the matter. Mrs. Delia Cardnell,
who lives in the rear of 419 Harriet street,
told them that she saw Mrs. Anderson in
tbe yard and she asked her for a glass of
water. She got a glass, tilled it with water
and handed it to Mrs. Anderson's hus
band. She refused to take the water from
him, and he got mad and threw the glass
in her face, cutting it.
Mrs. O'Malley, who lived in the same
house as the Andersons, found an empty
box marked "Rough on Rats" in the
yard. She gave it to John August Mack,
another resident in the bouse, and he
handed it to Ryan and O'Dea. Mack saw
Mrs. Anderson as she went into the yard,
and expressed the opinion that Mrs. An
derson's husband had nothing to do with
her poisoning herself, if she did so.
Emma and Lizzie Johnson told tbe de
tectives that Mrs. Anderson said to them
tbat she was going to tane poison and do
away with herself.
Rvan and ODea deemed it advisable to
place the husband, Andrew Anderson,
under arrest, and they locked him up in
the "tanks" at the City Prison pending
development* He was considerably under
tbe influence of liquor, and threatened to
poison himself if he got tbe chance.
The couple nave two daughters, who
some timH ago, while they lived in Ala
meda, were placed in tbe Maria Kip
Orphanage. One is now about 16 years of
age and the other 12.

Ballooning at the Chutesâ A Relay Race
by Local Bicyclists
Thousands within the iuclosure of the
Haigbt-street grounds witnessed Antonio
Pirri perform his amphibious act yesterday
afternoon, and they also saw C. W. Vosmer
go up in a balloon. Pirri rode down tbe
chutes on his bicycle, but in leaving it to
enter the lake he was not so fortunate as
on previous occasions. His head struck
the bottom, ana when he emerged it be
came necessary for a surgeon to stitch up
a good-sized scalp wound.
Vosmer's balloon did not inflate as well
as it should have, aid as a result he did
not rise high and was unable to cut away,
so he did not make the parachute leap. He
landed with the parachute and balloon on
liuena Vista Park.
The California Cycling Club and tbe
San Francisco Road Club have arranged
to run a thirty-five mile race at their
grounds, commencing next Monday and
continuing one week. I: will be a "ped
alistic" race, that is tbe rider? will mount
stationary bicylea and work the pedals for
six evenings until each shall record live
miles of foot work. The race will close on
Saturday afternoon when prizes will be
awarded to the winners. One will be a $50
cup, another a $35 suit of clothes, still
another a $25 suit and the last v $15 over
coat.
AN AFTERNOON WEDDING.
Miss Sadie Hecht and William
L. Gerstle to Be Mar
ried To-Day.
A Romance, tbe Op ning Chapter of
Which Was Begun Under
Italian Skies.
This afternoon at half past 2 o'clock at
tbe residence of Colonel and Mrs. M. H.
Hecht on Washington street will be cele
brated the wedding of their daughter Miss
Sadie Hecht aud William L. Gerstle.
The high social standing of the young
couple, together with the important com
mercial positions of iheir respective fam
ilies, makes their wedding of more than
passing interest. Mr. Gerstle is tbe son of
Lewis Gerstle and nephew of Louis Sloss
of the Alaska Commercial Company. The
Gerstle and Hecht families have been pre
viously connected by marriage, Marcus
Gerstle, tbe elder brother of the groom,
and Hilda Hecht, the older sister of the
bride, having been joined in tbe holy
bonds of matrimony about three years aeo.
Tbe wedding of Miss Sadie Hecht and
Mr. Gerstle is a love match pure and
simple. The young couple two seasons
ago spent a year together in European
travel and that friendship, the seeds of
which were sown under the sunny skies of
Italy, ripened into mutual affection on
the return to their native city.
Acting according to the often expressed
wish and earnest desire of the fair young
bride, the wedding is to be an extremely
simple one. When Dr. Voorsanger pro
nounces the young couple man and wife
only the immediate relatives of the high
contracting parties will be present. There
is to be no maid of honor, no bridesmaids
and no best man.
After the ceremony there is to be a re
ception for the members of both the fami
lies and a limited number of most inti
mate friends.
Tne bride, who is a most beautiful girl,
is to wear a gown remarkable alike for its
rich simplicity and beauty. Over a white
satin foundation fall turee skirts of white
fluffy tulle. The bottoms of these skirts
are not hemmed, but are left cut like the
skirts of the fairy of the baliet. The cor
sage is covered with innumerable tiny
puffs of tulle. The square-cut neck is
filied in with a yoke of exquisite point

Matrimony To-Day. v
lace. The sleeves are of tnlle and reach to
the elbow.
In the drawing-room where the cere
mony will be performed pink roses and
chrysanthemums are to be used for
decorative purposes. No set decoration
Is to be adhered to, but in the corridor,
the reception-room and the other apart
ments that are to be placed at tbe disposal
of the guests choice cut flowers and crow
ing ferns and palms are to be relied upon
for adornment.
Miss Hecht has received many elaborate
and costly presents, silver and crystal
prevailing. Mr. Gerstle and his young
bride have arranged to ieave by to-mor
row evening's overland for an extended
Eastern honeymoon.
In calling attention to its superior ad
vantages as a t'lace of residence a paper in
Manhattan, Kans., very properly dwells
with special stress upon th â  fact that the
Assessor was able to discover only forty
two pianos in tbat city.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, OCTOBER 5, 1896.
DEMOCRATS ARE
STILL AT WAR
Lanigan Men Say They
Were Eaten hy Rainey,
the Tiger.
And Enemies Will Report Lani
gan for Violating Civil
Service Laws.
REPUBLICANS AR3 AT WORK.
Veterans and the League of Clubs
Are Preparing for a Grand
Demonstration.
Although yesterday was the Sabbath,
tbe war among tbe angry factions of local
Democrats went on with unabated rancor,
tne anger of tbe Lanigan contingent rag
ing into a flume whenever tae hungry
spoils-seekers that infest it beheld the
vision of treasures slipping from their
grasp.
"It was understood at the outset," said
a badly disgruntled Democrat of the Lani
gan crowd last night, "that we were to
have a show at the Supervisors, but we
have been swallowed by Rainey. The only
man Lanigan is sure of is Hawkins. They
call Britt a Lanigan man, but he is not.
He is as much Rainey 's tool as any of tbe
otheis, and tbe truth is the festive Sam
owns nearly all of them.
"The Fire Department is, of course, be
hind the Rainey tickei, engaged in boost
ing it along with all the energy possible.
You must remember that 465 out of 512 of
the Fire Department are Democrats, and
they are so organized tbat they do the
bidding of Rainey without question."
But some of ihe Rainey men think Lani
gan has too much, not on tbe Board of
Supervisors, but elsewhere. It is said thai
he has too heavy a representation el-e
--where, and there are threats tbat steps
will be taken to report him to the Civil
Service Commission because of his offen
sive politics.
In this connection it has been held over
Lanigan for some time that he is likely
to get into serious trouble by reason of- his
meddlesome and active participation
in politics. The civil service rules pro
hibit such conduct as has characterized
tbe conduct of Lanigan for some time
past. He is known as a bad type of polit
ical boss, and a great many people in his
own party are growing weary of his con
duct. It is not among the impossibilities
that he will be compelled, with some oth
ers in high authority in bis department of
the Government, to give up local politics
as he now follows it, or give up his Fed
eral position. These threats and many
charges^and counter-charges among the
factions have made the local Democratic
situation anything but harmonious.
The silver Democrats are still bitter
against Phelan and bis gold friends,
whom they say they cannot consistently
support. The wars among the Bourbons
are so numerous that each day's sun sees
ibe factions more hopelessly divided in
their march to defeat.
Republicans are working with vim for
their ticket. Cheering reports come irom
all sources. The Onion Veterans' Patri

C. D. Dou las, Thomas Mai on, J. T, Bou

was adopted adding the permanent, offi
cers of the club to the executive com'mju
tee. Addresses were made by Coivad^s

G. E. Morse, chairman of the Lea ue of

Tne regular meeting of tbe Ocean View
Republican Club was held on Saturday
evening, in Taylor's Hall, President M.
F. Taylor in the chair. J. F. McGrath in
troduced a resolution indorsing the
pom necs selected by the conyeniion held
in the Auditorium and presided over by
T. Riordan. The resolution was unani
mously adopted, to. F. Taylor was
nominated and elected a delegate to the
convention on parade.
C. P. Robbins made some very able re
marks on the paramount issues of the
day. J. F. McGrath made some very
pertinent remarks in reference to silver
and protection, in which he depicted in a
very clear and precise manner the in
ability of free siiver to better the condi
tion of the working classes. Several new
members signed the roll. Mr. Tuylor, the
chairman, made some remarks in which
he announced that there would be a grand
ratification meeting of the club in the
near future. The meeting then adjourned
with cheers for McKiiley and Hobart.

(Jhm Lun Chee, a Dupont-btreet Druggist, was .Ruthlessly Shot m
the Back Yesterday by a Chinese Bravo and Fatally Wounded*
The Shooting Occurred at 722 Jackson Street.
A CABLE-CAR ACCIDENT.
Carelessness of the Railroad
Brings Serious Injury to
Three Persons.
Mrs. Chisholm, Eighty Years Old, Said
to Have Receiv -d Injuries Which
May End Fatally.
An accident which appears to be
wholly due to carelessness, occurred on
the .Larkin-street cable line yesterday
morning, resulting in the serious injury
of three persons, one of whom may die.
The railroad people are extremely reticent
about the affair, first denying that any
thing unusual had happened on their line.
They finally admitted, however, that
John McCarthy, A. Ahem and a Mrs.
Chris-holm, living on Folsom street, had
been injured and that the first two* had
been fully compensated for the unex
pected shake-up.
Shortly after 8 o'clock yesterday morn
ing the cable on the Larkin-street line
slipped the pulley near the Howard-street
power-house. There is an automatic ar
rangement by which the superintendent
of the power-house is notified by tbe clang
ing of a bell of such a mishap. As business
was pretty brisk at that hour it was
thought advisable not to shut down, but
to have the cars run from Market street
beyond Howard of their own motion.
This saving of time and money worked
very well until dummy 7 with car 21 at
tached came along. The gripman failed
to let go the rope as ordered, with the re
sult that when the dummy neared the
Howard-street line the grip ran acainat
the iron bar or bumper which is used to
protect the cross cable line, bringing the
car to a dead halt.
The passengers were hurled violently
.forward. Mrs. Chisholrn, who is 80 years
old, being the greatest sufferer. Several
ribs were broken and she was otherwise
injured. The railroad imme
diately effected a compromise witti Me
t'arthy and Ahem, paying the firs: $125
and the latter $80. It is said that an effort
was also made to compromise with Mrs.
Chisholm's relatives, but they would
hare nothing to do with such a proposi
tion.
Thrown From a Car.
While Mrs. Mary Donnelly, who resides
at 1146 Howard street, was alighting from
a cable car at the corner of Howard and
Ninth streets last evening the cars started
and she was thrown violently to the
erourxi. She was badly shaken up and
bruised, but fortunately sustained no seri
ous injuries.
The Nalionul Club.
The National Republican Club will Hold a
ratification meeting of the municipal nomi
nees on next Thursday evening at California
Hall, 620 Bush street, at which good speakers
will be present. There will be refreshments

their invited guests.
THE WORK OF
PAID ASSASSINS
Chin Lun Ghee, a Chinese
Druggist, Fatally
Wounded.
Pointed Out and Shot in the
Back by a Highbinder While
Entering a Store.
TWO CHINESE ARE ARRESTED.
A Debtor of the Druggist Took That
Way to Free Himself of His
Obligation.
In one of the busiest part of Chinatown
and in broad daylight a prominent Chi-
nese merchant was shot down by paid as
sassins yesterday morning and will in all
probability die.
Chin Lun Cliee, a druggist at 710 Dupont
street, was going among his customers
with his collection book in hand and
was just entering a store at 722 Jackson
street about 11:30 o'clock yesterday morn
ing when a Chinese fired a shot into his
back. The wounded man threw up his
bands and fell forward on his face into the
doorway.
There was another Chinese standing be
side the one who fired the shot and the
two ran into the doorway of No. 720. Po
liceman Freel, one of the Chinatown
squad, was standing on the corner of
Kearny street, about 100 feet away from
the scene of the shooting. He saw the
Cuinese fire tbe shot and immediately
started on a run for him. He followed
the two fleeing Chiiiese up the stairway of
No. 720 to the second story. They ran
into a kitchen in the rear and Fceel saw
the smaller of the two, who fired the shot,
pass t.e revolver to the other, who threw
it into an open fireplace.
Juat then Freel grabbed the shooter, and
he gave a yell as if he had been in the
grasp of a tiper. The other attempted to
get away, but Freel pulled out vis revolver
and they quietly submitted while the
oliicer put the handcuffs on them. Freel
toot them to the California-street station,
where the smaller, who fired tbe shot,
gave the name oi Ah Wah and the other
Ah Cnan. They were then taken to the
City Prison, but were not charged, pending
tbe result of Chin Luu Chee's injuries.
The wounded Chinese was driven to the
Receiving Hospital in the j.atrol-wa, on.
Dr. Bunnell found that the bullet had
entered his back, fracturing the spinai
column and paralyzing the lower limbs.
The bullet traveled downward and proba
bly lodged in the abdominal cavity.
No effort was made to probe for the bul
let, owint- to the weaK condition of the
patient. His wite, a pretty little Chinese
woman with a baby in her arms, was soon
at the hospital with a large number of
Chinese. Tne wife was allowed to sit be
side her husband's cot. but the crowd of
Chinese was kept outside, with the excep
tion of a Chinese doctor.
Policeman Freel, who arrested the two
Chinese, arrived at the hospital with them
shortly after 1 o'clock. Sergeant Colby,
who was on duty at police headquarters,
came to tbe hospital about the st<me time
to take Chin Lun Chee's ante-mor em
statement. Jee Chang Tone, interpreter for
the Chinese Six Companies, was present
and took the statement, translating it
into English.
following is the statement:

of the gunshot wound I have received to-day
at I'ZI Jackson street, in thi* City ana County.
My namo is Chin Lun Cbee. lam 51 years of
agu aud was born in China. lam not strong
enough to tell all the circumstances of the
shooting.
Chin Kin Leon told the two men that are
arrested to kill me because Chin Kin Leon
owed me money.' 1 asked aim io i ay me, and
for this reasun he told them to kill me.
When tbe man that is arre-ted shot at me I
turned my head and saw Â«nd recognized him.
Chin Kin'LeOn was standing by the two men.
I recognizeJ the smaller man of the twi that
snoi me. 1 heard the tall man tell the short
man that I was the man to shoot and point his
nnger to me.
Chin Lun Chee was too weak to write his
name, but made a cross, and the witnesses

were Sergeant Colby and interpreter Jee
Chang Tone.
Before finishing his statement Ah Wan
and Ah Chan were brought before him.
On being asked who fired the shot at him
he pointed to Ah Wah, who said, "Not
me," and was proceeding to talk volubly
when he was suddenly stopped by the
Sergeant. He then pointed to Ah Chan
and said he told Ah Wah to shoot him.
Ah Chan said, "Me not there," and the
wounded man's wife, with flashing eyes,
pointed her finger at him and poured out
a torrent of invectives till stopped by Dr.
Bunnell.
After the prisoners had retired Dr. Bun
nell wanted to give the patient a hypo
dermic injection to make him sleep, but
he begged first to speak privately to his
wife. They all retired to a distance as he
pulled her head gently down toward him
and fondly stroked her hair. Then for
some minutes he whispered in her ear,
and then allowed the doctor to use tne in
jection.
Besides the reason given in the ante
mortem statement for the shooting it was
ascertained that Chin Lun Chee, who has
conducted a drugstore at 710 Dupont
street for the past thirty years, had loaned
Chin Kin Leon $300 to enable him to pur
chase a wife from among the celestial
beauties in Chinatown. This amount
Chin Lun Chee had been anxious to get
back from Chin Kin Leon, but the latter
was not willing lo settle, which had made
them bad friends.
In the meantime Chin Lnn Chee had
notified Chin Kin Leon that unless the
money was paid by to-day the woman
would be taken from him and disposed of
for a sufficient consideration to satisfy the
claim oi Chin Lun Chee. This threat
seemingly worried him to such an extent
that the services of Ah Wah and Ah
Chan, two notorious nigh binders, were
called into requisition to settle tne in
debtedness by shooting Chin Lun Chee.
Chee was taken from the Receiving
Hospital last night to his home at 710
Dupont Btreet.
CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.
Bey. Or. Birch of the People's Church.
> peaks Against It at the Temple.
"The Peopl 's Church," established by
Rev. W. L. Birch quite recently, held its
second weekly meeting last evening at
Metropolitan Temple.
There was a preliminary musical pro
gramme. James Hamilton Howe, the or
ganist, accompanied the Misses Pearl and
Maud Noole in their cornet and trombone
duet, and Mrs. Anita F. Grand and Miss
Ella Ellis in their respective ?olos.
During his sermon Rev. Dr. Birch had
occasion to mention Professor Huxley,
whom he knew in Egypt. He said :
In the memorable words he uttered in his
last days in the theater at Oxford, England
he showed that what we need is not the sur
vival of thoye who happen to be fittest, but of
those who are morally the best. We should
repudiate the gladiatorial theoiy of existence
and in place oi ruthless self-as-ertion culti
vate self-restraint, which inspires the individ
ual not merely to respect, but also help his
fellows. Our influence shou.d be directed not
so much to the'survival of the nitest as to tne
fitting of as many as possible to survive
On this godly principle, therefore, 1 strongly
protest against the moden notiou tnat in cer
tain cases of insanity, suffering or crime, it is
righteous to cut off human life by artificial
means. Human life should be sacred. Private
assassination or national war isof the devil, an
inspiration of brute-nature. Does safety or
bucc> ss obtained by pistol, cannon or dynam
ite prove that in the sight of God you have
more right to live tnetn the man you have
slain? In order to live, are we justified in be
coming thieves? And in order to live are we
justified in slaying a man?

in St. Petersburg. It repr atnts Peter the
Great and weighs 1100 tons.
