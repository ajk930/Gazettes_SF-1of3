SEWALL GETS SECOND
PLACE ON THE TICKET,
Dark Horses Find Favor
With the Divided
Democracy.
BUT THE MAN FROM MAINE
HAS A "BARREL."
"Silver Dick" Bland Sacrificed Upon the
Altar of the Wrecked Bourbon
Party.
And Now the Dissenters Are Demanding a
Convention of Their Own to Choose
"Sound - Money" . Nominees for
President and Vice-President.
The Silver wing of the Democratic convention to-day nominated
Arthur Sewall of Maine for the Vice-Presidency, completely ignoring
Bland who was put up as a candidate and who should have been
nominated by acclamation, as a delegate remarked.
Prominent Democratic newspapers are bolting the party every
day and are demanding a sound money convention to represent the
opinions of the Mast.
There is no doubt that such a convention will be called and that
sound money nominees for President and Vice- President will be
placed in the field. The more candidates the merrier for good
people. JOHN PAUL COSGRAVE.

SYRACUSE, N. T., July 11.â The Syracuse Courier In an editorial to-day de
clines to support Bryan on a platform so un-Democratic as that adopted at Chicago.
BOSTON, Mass., July 11 â The Globe (Democratic), after speaking in warm
terms of the personal character and natural abilities of the Democratic nominee
for President, says: "The Globe is not, however, prepared at this time to support
Candidate Bryan. It does not approve of the platform."
The Herald (Independent) aayi i The Chicago convention has adopted a plat
form which antagonizes the honesty aud intelligence of the American, and
which, if it should find expression on the statute-book, would mean the debase
ment or the currency, the prostration of business and degradation of the Na
tional honor. On the other hand, the Republican party has openly and posi
tively taken up its position for the maintenance of the gofd standard, and has
placed at the head of the ticket a man who, measured from an honest money
point of view, is greatly safer and sounder than the Democratic nominee. Until
the contest in decided, our voice shall be raised and our influence given for the
election of McKinley to the Presidency.
HARTFORD, Conn., July 11 â The Times, the leading Democratic paper In

NEW YORK, N. V., July 11.-The Dally News this evening announces editor

DAYTON, Ohio, July 11.-The Morning rimes, the leading Democratic paper
of this city, has the following editorial: ThiÂ« paper is for sound money and has
no use for a 54-cent dollar. It insists upon a dollar which Is good in every civil
ized country on the globe ; a dollar that is recognized as a dollar wherever
American people go the world over. It is regretful that the Times cannot support
Mr. Bryan, but it cannot. It is not the man but the principle that actuates
this paper.
The Yolks Zeltung, the leading German paper of the connty and a Democratic
organ, also repudiates the Democratic National platform and ticket.
LOUISVILLE, Ky. f July 11.-The Evening Pout (D.) says That the ticket

TRENTON, N. J., July 11.-The True American, the Democratic organ of
New Jersey, is bitter in its comments concerning the platform and will not sup
port the men upon it.
MEMPHIS, Term., July 11.-The Evening Scimitar declares it cannot con

CHICAGO, 111., July 11.â The Demo
cratic National Convention close'ii up its
ticket this afternoon and adjourned sine
die soon after 3 o'clock. It selected as its
candidate for Vice-Presideni the veteran
shipowner and shipbuilder, Arthur
Sewall of Maine, for many years chair
man of tbe Democratic State Committee
of that State. This result was not
reached without a struggle. The same
number of ballots were required to make
it as to make the nomination for Presi
dent, viz: Sixteen candidates were placed
in nomination and were voted for with or
without their consent. All but four
quickly dropped out of sight. They were
Bland, Sibley, McLean and Sewail. After
the first ballot a movement wus started
(chiefly at the instigation of Governor
Altgeld or Illinois) to throw the nomina

taken, though he still retained scattering
supporters.
Mr. McLean's name was not formally
placed in nomination, bnt was brought
before tbe convention by the Ohio delega
tion voting for him. Starting with 111
votes he ran up to 296 on the fourth bal
lot, and then the chairman of the Ohio
delegation read a telegram from him
stating that all votes cast for him were
cast against his expressed wish and with
out his authority. Although the chairman
of the Ohio delegation qualified this decla
ration by saying it was the voice of Mr.
McLean and not that of the delegation,
the convention listened to Mr. McLean
and he passed out.
Arthur .Sewall of Maine, though present
in the city as a member of the National
Democratic Committee and in the con
vention just before receiving his nom
ination, and though for many years
chairman of the Democratic SUte Com
mittee of Maine, was personally known to
few members on tbe floor. He was placed
in nomination by a delegate from the
distant State of California, who gave no
personal details as to the candidate. The
seconder of Mr. Sewall, Mr. Thomas of
Colorado, addei little to the information
possessed by the convention except that
he testified to Mr. Bewall's business ability
as a shipbuilder, railroad president and
bank president.
On the first ballot Mr. Sewall mceived
100 votes. On the second these dropped
down to 37. They jumped up a^ain to 97
on the third ballot. After the withdrawal
of Bland and Bibley he reached second
place on the fourtii ballot, standine 261 to
McLean's 296, and was nominated unani
mously on the fifth baliot. There was
nothing more then for the convention to
do bnt to pass the customary votes oi
thanks and adjourn. It did so in compar
ative silence.

Be it remembered that in the year of
electricity, 1896, the good ship National
Democracy sailed upon the blue waters of
Lnke*Micuigan, commanded by First Mate
Altgeld, with Jonaun Moat steward, and
Stone of Missouri second mate. It is
recorded , also, in the book of Political
Doom, printed at Salt River, that on the
9th day of July of that year was heard the
Dleiiting of a Kid on the lonely shore, the
voice whereof was so sweet and uttered so
much music, that the good ship was hove
to, the anchor let down with a run, the
ship's small boat manned with two sailors
from Idaho and sent to the beach. The
Kid was taken from the bleak shore to the
â¢hip's cabin, where it was placed in Mate
Altgeid's bed and fed by Steward Most
until it began again to cry out most
piteously.
This Kid was from Nebraska, and its
nleat bad so much of sweetness and such
a silvery tone that it became a great favor
ite, and was put in charge of the helm to
steer the old ship through the golden
breakers that threatened its destruction
every moment. Verily it had been an un
lucky year for the vessel, for Captain
Cleveland had been thrown overboard by
the superstitious sailors because he carce
very near wrecking the ship on the gold
reef called Wall street, wherefore the ad
vent of the Kid was looked upon as a good
Oman.
A short time before they beard the bleat
ing of the Nebraska Kid the sailors had
seen two old farmers on the shore, who
hailed the vessel, because they wished to
voyage to their homes beyond the other
side of the lake. One was Farmer Bland
of the tribe of Missouri, and his voice was
so seductive that all who heard it called
him Silver Dick. The other was Farmer
Boies of the tribe of lowa, a man oi great
honesty, but he had come on his toes and
on his bands, and did not turn up his
pants at the bottom and keep a crease in
them. So the sailors heeded liim not, be
cause they feared he might be a Jonah, in
case of an unexpected rain in London.
Now, when the voices of the bleating
Kid. and Silver Dick were heard they were
so much alike in tone that the sailors
could not decide between them and they
almost came to blows, so fierce wus the
contention. Observing that the Kid had
a habit of sticking out first one of its fore
paws and then kicking the brains out of
the air with a hind foot, the sailors de
clared that the Kid was a tragedian and
that it could play the leading part in the
new play, "The Last Days of Democracy,"
and the Kid became the idol of the ship.
Now, it happened that in the month of
November of the same year a violent
storm called public sentiment raged, and
the old ship, weakened by many a perilous
voyage and topheayy by reason of having
thrown overboard all her ballast and good
people, foundered and sank to the bottom,
the last thing heard being the Kid's
bleating.
Bat jus< as all the crew were about to be
drowned â some floating on free- trade frag
ments of the ship's hencoops and others
on pieces of wreckageâ the stanch ship
Republicanism, built in 1861 and com
manded by Major McKlnley, sailed by
that way and saved most of the unfortu
nate sailors from death.
The crank convention finished its work
to-day in the cranky manner that was ex
pected. It had slapped the face of its
champion, Bland, on the day before, and
when his friends, hoping that it would
have the magnanimity and gratitude to
give him the second place on the ticket
that the champion might accompany the
cause, placed his name before the conven
tion mob to-day, it not only again slapped
his face, but kicked him under the coat
tail.
The defection in the leading newspapers
of the party is ominous. They are drop
ping off every day, some of them advising
their readers to support the Republican
nominees and others advising a sound
money Democratic convention and ticket.
Dana and tue New York Sun were obliged
to desert this bogus Democracy. Then
followed the Brooklyn Eagle, the Rich
mond Times, the Chicago Staats-Zeitung,
the Chicago Chronicle and a host of other
Democratic newspapers, which have been
forced to bolt the party because their sub
scribers demanded such action. No news
paper can afford to fly in the faces of the
people who subscribe for and advertise in
it, and when a Democratic paper bolts its
party it is an evidence that the Democrats
who support it have also bolted the party.
The Richmond (Va.) Times (D.) says
this morning:
"Onr worst fears have not only been
realized, but new and horrible doctrines
have been added to the Chicago platform
which cannot possibly bind a Democrat
who is unwilling to abandon the funda
mental principles of his party."
The fact that the delegates of New York,
Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Massachusetts
and other sound-money States did not
vote, but remained silent and inactive in
their seats can have but one interpreta
tion, and that is that the sound- money
Democrats, unable to support the B. and
8. Populistic tonic of silver Democracy,
have decided to call a souud-money con
vention and nominate two sound-money
men for whom the great mass of Eastern
Democrats may vote. That this will be
done I have no doubt. It will be a life
and death struggle between the two fac
tions of the Democracy, and the Republi
cans will hold reserved seats in the bull
ring with Mr. Hobart of New Jersey as
timekeeper and Major McKinley of Ohio
as referee and undertaker.

GERMAN DEMOCRATIC PAPERS

Old-Line Democrats Will Not Support
the Doings of the Chicago
Convention.
DUBUQUE, lowa, July 11.â The finale
of tbe convention at Chicago proves to
have developed out of the purpose inci
dentally revealed from the beginning.
The country expected Bland's nomina
tion. He had age, experience, undeniable
honesty and a Democratic record. A
member of John R. McLean's delegation
discounted all this by informing the coun
try that Bland, a shouting Methodist,
reared in the amen corner and still labor
ing in the love leasts of his church to keep
on "prayin' ground and pleadin' terms,"
has a Catholic wife, and that these two
have lived in Christian peace. As such
peace is coming to be regarded as treason
in this country, in the racket of the last
ballot McLean's delegation ran away from
the Missourian and helped nominate to
the Presidency the descendant of an Irish
Orangeman and a "boy orator" at that.
Some things are now accounted for.
One can see why the most conspicuous
opponent of the A. P. A. in the Union
was expelled from the Michigan delega
tion and how the surprises were so well
arranged and sprung upon the conven
tion. Perhaps ii is fortunate that all the
"isms" of the country are getting in one
crowd, that the open enemies of public
order and the secret enemies of personal
conscience are grouped where patriotism
aud principle can smile and destroy them.
This morning the Democratic press of
tbe country is i.i open revolt, That im
mense contingent of German papers,
which joined the Democracy under Cleve
land, bolts and .the honest and thrifty
German vote bolts with it. Trie old line
Democrats are not lured by the song of suc
cess. They will not surrender to promises
of a share in the fruits of victory, for they
refuse to profit upon the ruin of their
country.
Therefore, the movement which I find
in every State in tbe Union to preserve
the party and its principles and defeat the
dynamite ticket adopted at Chicago. That
ticket is pledged to every vice that ulcer
ates in American politics. It is leprous
with repudiation, dishonor, discredit and
religious proscription. The twin lairies
characterized in the first of these dis
patches are now the center of a group of
evil spirits never before joined in a com
mon cause.
The platform is a covenant with larceny
and a league with murder, for it repudi
ates contracts and denies the richt of the
, NEW TO-DAT.

of the victor. The galleries were not filied
to a fifth of their capacity.
Tbe cnairman of tbe Pennsylvania dele
gation, Mr. Harrity, was present, but most
of his co-delegates had left the city. Some
of the New York delegates were in the
hall, but it was agreed that they were to
take no part in the voting for Vice-
President
The New Jersey delegates were absent in
a body. General Bragg and most of the
delegates from Wisconsin were on the
floor, but only the five Wisconsin silver
men were to cast their individual votes for
the Vice-Presidential candidate.
At 11 a. m. Chairman White called tbe
convention to order, aud prayer having
been dispensed with, Mr. Harrity of Penn
sylvania announced that the present Na
tional Committee would meet at the Pal
mer House at 3 o'clock this afternoon and
would be glad to welcome the new Na
tional Committee.
Senator Jones of Arkansas moved that
the convention proceed to the nomination
of the candidates for the Vice-Presidency,
and the motion was agreed to with cheers.
George Fred Williams of Massachusetts
was put in nomination by Mr. O'Sullivan,
a delegate from that State. Mr. O'Sullivan
said in part:
"This convention has nominated a man
who has sprung irom the loins of the peo
ple. Now that you have given a platform
to the South and West, carry the war into
Africa and give to the East a candidate for
the Vice-Presidency. I nominate a man
from Massachusetts who has the courage
of his convictions and who came out for
silver against an almost unanimous pub
lic sentiment.
"Gentlemen, the war is over. If you
want to answer that sullen delegation
from New York (pointing to where the
New York delegates sat) come to the East
for your candidate for Vice-President
Nominate a man who was once a gold
man, but who saw the error of his ways
and whose voice has often been raised
.against corporations â George Frederick
Williams of Massachusetts." [Cheers.]
Mr. Marsden of Louisiana took the plat
form and said :
"I want to name to you a wheel-horse to
keep this young colt in the traces. He is
a thoroughbred, and therefore we should
take all the better care of him. The man
I shall name comes from a pivotal State.
Wbo is tbe wheel-horse and which is the
pivotal State? John R. McLean of Ohio
is that man and Ohio is that pivotal Slate.
[Cheers.] Give us McLean and we will
sweep the country."
Mr. Maloney of Washington State, stand
ins in the aisle, said : "In the name of
the State of Washington I place in nom
ination our honest son, James Hamilton
Lewis."
Hon. J. H. Currie of North Carolina was
next introduced. He said be desired to
name a man whose fame was not confined
to one State, but extended all over this
broad land; a man revoied and honored
in his own State and all over the country
where he was known. In the last election
he was nominated on tbe Democratic
ticket for the high position of Supreme
Judge of North Carolina, and received tbe
votes of the men ot all parties. Repub
licans and Populists included. He closed
by naming Judge Walter Clark.
The chairman in presenting the next
speaker said of him : "I had the honor of
serving in two CongresÂ«es with him. I
saw him there when the Wilson tariff bill
was under consideration, and although he
stood on tbe floor and admitted he knew
of the steel trust, as it is called, to control
the manufacture of steel rails, and al
though be was engaged in an occupation
which derived an immense profit from
that trust, he had the honesty to contend
and vote that steel rails be put upon tbe
free list. [Cheers.] I present to you big
hearted, brave, honest Tom Johnson of
Ohio." [Cheers.]
Hon. Tom Johnson took the stage
and put in nomination George W. Fithian
of Illinois, saying of him: "He has been
six years in Congress and his action and
his every vote there places him in accord
with your platform. He has tbe merit,
which, I think, is absolutely necessary
for the Vice- Presidency. He is not a
wealthy man. This fight will have to be
won by the people, by tbe men who are in
terested in humanity. If it is to be a race
between money and men money will be
on tbe other side, for the moneyed men of
the Democratic party have mostly gone to
McKinley. lam not a free-silver man; I
do not believe in free silver; but Ido be
lieve that the Democratic party has
started a great revolution for the good of
the people. But for free silver, which I
thing is wrong, you have inaugurated a
movement for the good of humanity and
therefore lam with you heartily. [Ap
plause.] Make not the mistake of think
ing you can bind anybody with money, it
will kill the ticket before the people. Mr.
Fitbian is from Illinois. He comes from
a State that is pivotal and I hope to God
that you will nominate him." [Applause.]
Hon. William Miller of Oregon Â«aid he
rose to place in nomination a man who
had been twice the Governor of tbe great
State of Oregon as the Democratic nomi
nee, notwithstanding the fact that the
Slate was 10,000 Republican â a roan re
cently nominated Mayor of the ereat
metropolis of tbe Northwest â ex-Governor
Sylvester Pennoyer. [Faint applause.]
When he was Governor of Oregon, con
tinued Mr. Miller, the railroad companies
had trouble with their men and he went
upon the scene of action and he said to
the corporations: "Pay your men and
you will have no more trouble." They
paid Ibeir men and be did not call out the
militia. [Cheers.] He is in hearty sym
pathy with labor and all the great labor
movements of this country will indorse
him. I appeal to yon to Tecognize the Pa
cific Coast and nominate ex-Governor
Pennoyer of Oregon."
Senator White retired temporarily, leav
ing Representative Richardson of Tennes
see to preside over the convention.
William R. Burke of Los Angeles. Cal.,
presented the name of Arthur Bewall of
Maine, as a man who strove "for liberty
when God himself was dumb."
Mr. Showalter of Missouri presented the
name of Joseph C. feibley of Pennsylvania.
He spoke of tbe Presidential candidate as
a modern Moses, endowed with tbe cour
age of a Jackson and the eloquence of a

American people from bondage into !
liberty. Tbe name cf Sibley on the ticket
would, Mr. Showalter said, add strength
and solidity to it. [Cheers.]
C. S. Thomas of Colorado seconded the
nomination of Arthur Sewall as a man
distinguished for business ability and life
long devotion to the caus.? of Democracy,
and whose name will fill up aud round out
the work performed by the convention
yesterday.
O. W. Powers of Utah presented the
name of Senator Daniel of Virginia. He
lauded Democracy as the party whose
principles were "equal rights to all and
unjust discriminations to none." "You
have inaugurated," he said, "a new era,
wherein silver and gold, the two money
metals, shall go hand in baud as God in
tended, scattering blessings on every side.
I desire now, in behalf of the youngest
State of the Union, the State whose star
was placed on the flag last Saturday, to
suggest the name of John W. Daniel of
Virginia for Vice-President I present it
without his request ana without his knowl
edge."
Mr. Jones of Virginia acknowledged the
compliment paid to his State, but said he
had been instructed by Senator Daniel to
say if his name should be presented as a
candidate for Vice-President that under
no circumstances should it to voted on in
the convention.
F. P. Morris of Illinois seconded the
nomination of Mr. Sibley, and spoke of
him as a man whose "name and personal
ity .vould consume Iniquities and destroy
corruption."
"If," he added, "you link his name to
that of the masterful orator from Ne
braska, you will be inscrh>ine victory on
all your banners as sure as tbe stars
shine at midnight or the sun at noon
time."
Ulrich Stone of Ohio seconded the nom
inatien of McLean, and spoke of him as
tbe man who, through the Cincinnati En
quirer, made this silver convention possi
ble.
George W. Fithian of Illinois spoke in
support of tbe nomination of Mr. Sibley.
"Pennsylvania's honored son." Although
Mr. Sibley had been represented as a Pop
ulist be was as good a Democrat as any
man who had a seat in the convention. It
was true that Mr. Sibley differed with
President Cleveland and had had the cour
age to express his convictions, regardless
and fearless of the administration and
everybody else, and it seemed to him that
Mr. Sibley's criticism* of tbe administra
tion could not be found fault with In a
convention which had, by nearly a two
tbirds majority, refused to sustain a reso
lution commending the administration of
Mr. Cleveland.
John Scott of Bath, Me., spoke in praise
of Arthur Sewall of Maine, as one of the
leading business men of New England and
as president of a National Bank; as a man
whose ships spread their white wings to
the winds of every ocean and carried the
United States flag to tbe uttermost parts
of tbe earth. He could not promise that
tbe delegation from Maine would be be
hind Mr. Sewall's nomination, but he
j could promise that next November Mr.
Sewall would have the Democracy of
Maine behind him. [Cheers.]
"Wreathe," he said, "with the sunflower
of Nebraska the pine flower of Maine,
and next November these flowers en
twined will prove more threatening to tbe
Napoleon of Ohio than the tread of the
marching Prussians proved to the great
Napoleon at Waterloo."
ThU closed the nomination oratory, and
tbe balloting began at 12 o'clock.
The balloting proceeded without notice
able incident until New York was cailed.
When the announcement was made,
"New York declines to vote," the galleries
raised a yell. The chairman of the Ohio
delegation, standing on his chair, said
although Mr. McLean was not a candidate,
the Ohio delegation insisted on casting its
Vict-Presidential votes for John R. Mc-
Lean. A poll of tbe delegation was de
manded and it was disclo-ed that at least
four of the delegates present were tor Sib
ley and one for Fithian, but under the
unit rule the entire vote went to McLean.
Pennsylvania announced through Chair
man Harrity that it stood 7 for Sibley, 2
for Pattison and 59 delegates were absent
or not voting. Alaska with its six newly
conferred delegates (all gold men) declined
to vote.
Oregon changed from Pennoyer to Sib
ley. Georgia, which had been passed by
request, cast her vote for Blanu, at the
i same lime expressing the opinion that be
! ought to be nominated by acclamation.
I Tbe State of Nebraska, out of delicacy lest
its vote might be taken as an indication of
Mr. Bryan's wishes, asked to be excused
I from voting for the present, and was cx
i cused accordingly.
Tbe counting of the ballots was pur
posely delayed to enable tbe leaders to ar-
I range, if possible, to s wing the convention
over to Sibley.
Utah attempted to precipitate it by
changing its vote from Daniel to Bland,
but the cbair declined to permit changes
in tbe vote at this stage of the proceedings.
The clerk announced tbe result of the first
I ballot as follows: Blackburn 20, Bland 62,
i Teller 1, Daniel 11, Harrity 21, Boies 20,
Williams of Illinois 22, White 1, Fithian 1,
Williams of Massachusetts 76, McLean 111,
Lewis 11, Clark 50, Bewail 100, Sibley 163;
absent or excused 258. Total number
of votes cast, 682; neoessary to choice, 455.
At 1 o'clock the second ballot was begun
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 12, 18^6.
and Alabama attempted to lead tbe Bland
stampede, but the next States called did
not take it up to any great extent, largely
adhering to thfir first choice. Several of
the States having the largest delegations,
however, asked to be passed for tne pres
ent with tne view of casting decisive votes
later on.
Wben Rhode Island was called the
chair (Mr. Richardson) said tne chairman
of the Rhode Island delegation had called
upon him a few moments ago and stated
that his delegation was compelled to leave
to take the train forborne, but bad author
ized him, with the consent of the conven
tion, to cast their votes for Harrity.
W. H. White, chairman of the Wash
ington delegation, made a little diversion
in the monotony of the proceedings by
standing on his cbair and declaring that
the vote of Washington was unfortunately
divided by the influence of tbe "gold
bngs." The chairman cut him short by
declaring that debate was not in order. It
became evident that the Bland move was
not a success and Governor Stone of Mis
souri, who had withheld the vote of his
State till the last, got up and said that the
delegation from tbe State of Missouri had
no authority to present tbe name of Mr.
bland for the nomination for Vice-Presi
dent, but if the convention voted for nim
tney did so on their own responsibility.
He then proceeded to cast the vote of
Missouri for other candidates. s
At 1:12 o'clock the result of the second
ballot was announced as follows: Wil
liams of Illinois 13, Clark 22, Partison 1,
Harrity 21, Bland 244, Williams of Mass
achusetts 16, McLean 158, Sewall 37. Sib
ley 113; absent or not voting, 255. Total
vote cast, 675; necessary to choice, 450.
A third ballot was immediately ordered,
but before it had proceeded far tbe chair
man said he thought it proper to inter
rupt the balloting to introduce Arros Cum
mings of Tammany Society, New York,
who would read a telegram which would
be of interest. Mr. Cummings then took
the stage and read the following dispatch
from Mr. Sibley, dated from Pittsburg, Pa.,
to-day:
Hon. Amos Cummings: Please do not permit
my name to be presented. I so instructed my
friends yesterday. JosEru C. Sibley.
When Missouri was called Governor
Stone said: "Under instructions of the
majority of the delegation Missouri casts
I her 30 votes for Bland."
The result of the convention's third
i ballot was officially announced at 2:10
;p. M. as follows: Pattison 1; Daniel 6,
Bland 255, McLean 210, Sewall 97, Siblpy
; 19, Williams of Massachusetts 15, Clark
22. No choice.
It being evident by this time that the
convention could not be stampeded to
Bland, when the fourth ballot was started â¢
Governor Stone of Missouri addressed the
convention. He said:
"I desire on behalf of the Missouri dele
gation and as the friend of Mr. Bland to
j express to you our grateful appreciation
lof yonr kindness. lam now in receipt of
a telegram irom Mr. Bland in which he
j says substantially that he would deem it
: unwise and impolitic to nominate both
I candidates from the west side of the Mis
: sissippi River. [Cheers.l He desires me
I to say that the nomination of Mr. Bryan
has his warm and hearty approval. And
he thinks that the nomination of Vice
; President should be with one object alone
in view â that is, the strengthening of the
ticket Accordingly he directs me to say
that he wishes his name to be withdrawn
from the consideration of the convention
for tbe position." [Cheers.]
The fourth ballot was then begun, in
the course of tbe vote Mr. Fithian of Illi
nois ueciared (out of order and amid great
confusion) that the convention could not
afford to nominate a man for the Vice-
Presidency who had announced that he
could support one principle of the plat
form â that in favor of imposing an income
tax. The chairman refused to allow any
I debate during the vo:e and directed Mr.
j Fithian to take his seat.
The result cf the fourth ballot was an
i nounced as follows: Williams of Massa
> chusetts, 9; Clark, 4<>', Harrity, 11; Patti
j son, 1; Daniel, 54; Sewall, 261; McLean,
j 296; whole number of votes cast, 678; ab
sent or not voting, 252; necessary to a
choice, 452.
Before the fifth ballot was entered upon
the chairman of the Ohio delegation, Ul
rich Sloan, made the following statement:
"The Ohio delegation has received two
telegrams from Mr. McLean. They state
substantially what I said this morning,
but that you may have the exact words I
will read what Mr. McLean says. Ho
speaks for himself, not for the Ohio dele
gation: 'Any vote cast for me for Vice-
President is against my Expressed wish
and against my authority. Please an
nounce this to the convention.
"'John R. McLean.' "
"Thfs is Mr. McLean, not the Ohio dele
gation," added Mr. dloan. Nevertheless,
the effect of the telegram was felt In the
next ballot Louisiana and other States
who bad voted for McLean changed for
Sewall, and when Wisconsin was reached
sufficient votes had been cast for Sewali to
; elect. Nebraska immediately changed her
I eighteen votes from McLean to Bewail;
Kentucky followed and Onio chipped in
and a procession of State standards started
round the hall in honor of the nominee.
But there was no cheering.
The usual clearing up resolutions of
thanks to the temporary chairman and
Others were agreed to.
ANOTHER
SURPRISE,
Arthur Sewall's Nomina
tion Happened Unex
pectedly.
HIS SELECTION A LUCKY
CHANCE.
Bland of Missouri and McLean
of Ohio Declined the
Honor.
A MAN FROM THE FAR EAST
WANTED.
History and Personality of the Maine
Shipbuilder Who Has Become
Famous.
The Call Headqcartbbs, 1
Great jnokthekn Hotel, >â¢
Chicago, 111., July 11.)
The unexpected occurred again to-day.
Arthur bewail of Maine was nominated
for the Vice- Presidency by the Democratic
National Convention. John R. McLean
was leading on the fourth ballot, when his
name was withdrawn. He wired that he
would not accept tne nomination. It was
then that the Illinois delegation, which
was solid for the Ohioan, went over to
Sewall. His nomination followed on the
nfth ballot.
When Governor Stone of Missouri re
tired Bland on the third ballot, having
been advised to do so by a telegram direct
from "Silver Dick," who declared that it
would be suicidal for the party to name
the President and V ice-President from the
Mississippi Valley, McLean shot forward,
and had 296 votes on the fourth ballot,
with 261 recorded for Sewall. Sibley's re
tirement aided the efforts ot tbe man from
Maine. Sibley himself had been on the j
floor of the convention during the week, i
and had made many irienda by his strong
and happy personality. McLean was a
hot favorite from the start, and might
have secured the nomination had he not
retired when the delegates were bending
his way.
Arkansas led the bolt from Bland to
Sewail on the third bal'ot and was fol- j
lowed by California. Georgia switched to I
McLean and Illinois later assumed a like j
attitude. Idaho, led by Hillard, went
from Bland to Sewall on the fourth Dallot
and was followed by other Bland men, in
cluding tbÂ« Missourians, and then all the
larger delegations began falling in line for
the man from Maine.
The West wanted Sewall in order to off
set the cry of sectionalism, which had
bren raised by Eastern delegates against
the solid West and the solid Buath. The
further East they could co to get a man
for second place on the ticket the better
silver men, who bad heard and heeded the
cry of sectional differences and animosi
ties, were suited. Upon this basis the
nomination of Sewall seems to have given
general satisfaction.
Quite a healthy demonstration of ap
proval followed his nomination by accla
mation. The Maine delegates were par
ticularly jubilant and led tne procession
of standard-bearers about tbe convention
hall.
The candidate for Vice-President is a
resident of Bath, Me. He is a ship-builder
and it is said has money to throw at the
! birds.
Had a vote for Vice-President been
! taken last night McLean would probably
; have been the nominee. He was the only
j candidate prominently mentioned for the
! place ud to tbe time wben the convention
adjourned. The silver men and the re
form element in the National Democracy
bad heard that there were things in the
life of John R. McLean that would not
bear the sunlight, aad besides, they did
not like his attitude on the income-tax
question. They wanted him, however, for
his "sack," but it was learned during the
night that McLean was not a liberal
spender â in fact, it was â  ated that he was
I a flunky and even if named for Vice-Pres
j ident would not contribute largely to the
campaign fund.
On the other hand, Sewall is a generous
fellow, affable and easy of approach. He
has been a member of the National Com
mittee for a number of years and is highly
esteemed by tbe committeemen from tbe
various Btates. This nomination was
fostered by his silver associates on the
National Committee, and his sincerity in
regard to tbe white metal wm ao well
formulated that it impressed the delegates
from the South and West and they stood
by him nobly until he was finally nom
inated.
My impression of Sewall is that he is a
dignified and kindly man. He is a man
of conviction, for when all New England
was holdin;* out for the single gold stand
ard he persistently blew the silver
trumpet.
Born at Bath, Maine, in 1835, he early
became associated with his'father in tbe
ship-building buiiness. The firm wit. 1 )
which he is associated has built some of
the largest ships in the world, as well as
the only steel sailing-ship ever constructed
in this country. Mr. Sewall is intere.-ted
in several railroads and also connected
with a number of banlnng concerns of the
town in which he lives. He was one of
the original silver men of New England.
The delegates are rapidly leaving town.
Nearly all the State headquarters Lave
been closed, and although it is 100 in tbe
shade to-day tbe enthusiastic supporters
of Bryan and Sewali are to-night shouting
loud and long for the nominees of the
greatest Democratic National Convention
ever held.
The California delegates a^e scattering

SEWALL AND SILVER.
The Nominee Speaks of the Spread
of the Movement In the Eastern
States.
CHICAGO, 111., July 11.â Mr. Sewall
was present in the convention during the
first four ballots fpr the Vice-Presidential
nomination. He left tbe hall during the
fifth baliot and was on the platform of tbe
railway station waiting for a train down
town when word was taken to him of tbe
result. He went immediately to his rooms
in tbe Palmer House, where be was seen
after ihe adjournment of the convention
by.a reporter of the United Press.
Mr. Pewall 13 a fine-looking man of good
stature and solid build. He is 61 years of
age and look 3 the prosperous New Eng
land sbipbuilder, railroad man and banker
that he is. He paid he preferred to do no
:alking, but consented to answer a few
questions. He said :
"The nomination came to me entirely
unexpectedly. I had no idea of any such
result wben I came to Chicago. I wish
you would also say that it came -without
solicitation on my part, t shall remain
in Chicago several days and have not de
cided what day I shall start for my
borne."
Aaked for his opinion of the chances of
. the ticket in the East, Mr. Sewall said;
"I think they are very good. The
strength of the silver men in the East is
greater even than the friends of silver
realize. Judging by our own State the
silver party is strong and constantly grow
ing there. In my State when I announced
myself as a silver man two years ago I
could count thÂ« silver men on the fingers
of my two nands. To-day the majority of
Democrats in Maine are silver men. I an
ticipate a lively campaign in Maine, and it
is not impossible ihat we may carry the
State."
Mr. Sewall was asked :
"If the Democrats are defeated in the
Septemoer elections in Maine will it not
hurt the National ticket?"
He replied :
â¢ - It ougut not to do so. The Republicans
generally win there. In fact not since
1880 have the Democrats carried the State."
"Will tne refusal to support the ticfeet
by the Democratic newspapers in the East
hurt the ticket?"
"I don't think so," he replied.
Mr. Sewall said he had never met Mr.
Bryan until he came to this convention.
He added :
"He is a very fine man. I heartily ap
prove of the candidate and indorse the
platform. I tnink the convention has
reached a successful conclusion, and I have
great coniidence in the success of our
ticket."
ARTHUR SEWALL.
Sketch of the Life of the Man Nom
inated for Vice-President by the
Chicago Convention.
Arthur Sewall, the Vice-Presidential
nominee of tbe Democratic party, is well
known in San Francisco among ship
owners and agents. He has been here sev
eral times in the capacity of managing
owner in several ships in which he is
largely interested, and all, or nearly all, of
which were built at his ship} r ards in Bath,
Maine. The large ships Shenandoah, Sus
quehanna and Kenilwortb, Henry Vil
lard. Reaper, Willie Rosenfeld, Irpquois.
W. F. Babcock, Solitaira and the Dirigo
have been controlled Dy Mr. Sewall. Tne
names of these vessels are familiar about
the city front. The last time Mr. Sewall
was in San Francisco was aDout one year
ago. The firm of Williams, Dimond &
Co. are his agents in San Francisco. The
concern of which Mr. Sewall is the head
is Arthur Sewall & Son.
The father of the Vice-Presidential can
didate was a builder of ships in Bath wben
that industry was at its height and there
was money to be made in that way. They
were wooden ships of the old time sort, as
stout and as trim as they could be made
by the burly and skilled shipwrights of
New England. The father laid the basis
of an enduring business, and provided a
handsome competence for his family. His
son Arthur became identified with tbe
business in due time, and another brother
also was a shipbuilder, but he died some
years age. Arthur Sewall has continued
in the business, and has added to the
original wooden-ship plant a steel ship
yard. From the latter it is not known
that more than one steel ship has been
produced â the Dirigo. The product of the
Sewall plants has included schooners io
considerable numbers. In fact, the Sewall
name has been connected with shipbuild
ing for many years.
Arthur Sewall has been largely inter
ested in railroads, and has been president
of the Eastern Maine Railroad and also
president of the Boston and Maine Rail
road. He has been largely concerned in
other business enterprises. He is esti
mated to be a wealthy man â a millionaire.
He lives in an elegant mansion on the
finest street in Bath, the Sewall home
havine cost somewhere about $60,000 and
perhaps more. About it are fine grounds,
conservatories and generally pleasing and
sightly accessories. It may be recollected
that, although he is a Democrat, he hand
somely entertained President Harrison
when the latter visited Bath a few years
ago. Harold M. Sewall, who was United
States Consul-General at Apia, Samoa,
during the troublous times ki which Malie
toa was a prominent figure, is a son of
Arthur SewalL The son is an ardent Re
publican, and was a delegate to the Re
publican National Convention of 1896 at
St. Louis which nominated William Mc-
Kinley for President.
Personally Mr. Sewall is about 5 feet 8
inches tall, rather heavily built. His
whiskers and hair are somewhat gray. He
is 61 years old. His manner is modest and
unassuming. He has not figured as an
office-holder largely in politics. Maine,
his native State, it will be recollected, has
been at times theÃceneof much discussion
over the money question. Solon Chase,
the once-noted Greenback leader, stumped
the State in behalf of "fiat money" in
company with Samuel F. Cary of Ohio in
a campaign in which the agriculturist was
pushed to the fore, the favorite illustra
tion of financial questions chosen by Solon
Chase to point his meaning being an alle
gory about "them steers."
Captain McLoon, who resides at 2428
Jackson street, this City, an old towns
man of Arthur Sewall, has just returned
from Bath. He recently sailed a ship be
longing to Arthur Sewall, but he has
little to add to what is already know
concerning the personality of Mr.
Sewall. Captain McLoon gave a repre
sentative of The Call some facts concern
ing Bath, Me., which form the basis of a
picture of the surroundings among which
Arthur Sewall has lived. Bath, he says,
is a quiet little place, its streets shaded
with great trees after the fashion of so
many New England towns, an air of pence
and industrial decay resting upon it. The
ship-building industry is far from being
what it was. Other industries have been
established there, but have generally
failed. "The town is no bigger than it
was when I was a boy there," said Captain
McLoon. Into this picture the stability of
the Sewall family fits as into a frame.
Arthur Sewall, who was born in Bath
November 25, 1835, lives on the estate
which has bee.n m the possession of the
Sewall family since 17G0, when his grand
father took the title only three removes
from a grant by King George. Among the
vessels built in earlier days the old-fash
ioned whaling vessels and coasters figured.
The State of Maine was once famous for
these craft The hrm has been Sewall <fe
Son for three generations.
Arthur Sewall has two children, Harold
M. and William D. He is president and
principal owner of the Bath National
Bank. He retains large interests in rail
roads and railroad building. For many
years he has been chairman of the Maine
Democratic State Committee and he has
been a liieion" Democrat.

Chicago, 111.. July 11.)
The Democratic National Convention
has adjourned, but it has set in motion
forces that will stir every stratum of so
ciety in this country as they have not been
stirred since the straggle for the enancipa
tion of the black slaves. I do not now speak
of the merits of the issues presented. Re
gardless of the merits, the battle will be
tremendously earnest and its results, both
immediate and remote, must be of great
importance to mankind, no matter which
side wins.
At the head of the movement on the
Democratic side is a man of indomitable
will, tireless energy, commanding ability
and sublime courage. He has to-day se
lected New York as the first battle-ground
of the campaign and is going there in per
son to lead the assault He is to speak in
Madison Square Garden, New York city,
during the present month, and as soon as
possible he will speak in all the large
cities of New York. The campaign prom
ises to be as earnest and vigorous as was
the course of the silver delegates in the
convention.
The silver men, flushed by their first
victory over the gold forces, are filled with
the hope of similar successes at the polls.
On the streets of Chicago to-day men are
everywhere discussing the money ques
tion. The gold men are threatening to
form an independent sound-money Dem
ocratic party, but the silver men are
utterly indifferent to the threats. They
seek to argue the question with the gold
men, but do not attempt to dissuade them
from bolting. Indeed, most of the silver
ites think the gold men will knife the
ticket secretly if they do not bolt, and that
they can do less harm as bolters than they
can ac nomt.ial supporters of the ticket.
The contest for tne nomination for Vice-
President this morning was full of sur
prises, and was much more animated than
was expected. The Californians were
startled on learning on the first ballot that
Joseph C. Sibley of Pennsylvania was
practically slated for the place. As Sibley
was a supporter of the funding bill in the
Fifty-third Congress, we set to work dili
gently to prevent his nomination. It re
quired Quick and hard work, but the sec
ond ballot showed that his nomination
had been made impossible.
It pained me greatly to be obliged to
make such a vigorous and uncompromis
ing fight against Sibley, because person
ally I esteem him highly. He is a good
man, but, like Dog Tray, fell into bad
company, and this is no time for trifling
with supporters of the funding scheme.
I know nothing of Mr. Sewall, the
nominee, except that the members of the
Democratic National Committee, with
whom he served for several years, speak of
him in the highest terms. I think that
one of the controlling reasons for his
nomination was the determination of the
convention to disprove and set at rest the
foolish and unpatriotic assertion of Sen
ator Tillman that this is a sectional con
test of the South and West against the
East. Sewall is and has long been an
earnest advocate of the free and unlimited
coinage of silver.
Under a resolution adopted by the con
vention to-day it is quite likely that Mr.
Tarpey will be added to the National
Committee. He is unquestionably a most
useful and influential man in his present
place. James G. Magcire.
JONES MADE CHAIRMAN,
Succeeds Harrlty in Guidlnar the
Destinies of the Democratic
National Committee.
CHICAGO, 111., July 11.â In accordance
with the call issued by Chairman Harrity
of the National Committee the members of
the old and new organizations met at the
Palmer House at 5 o'clock this afternoon.
There were present all told about seventy
five gentlemen and besides the members
of the committee a number of newspaper
men were given seats. Mr. Harrity said,
after calling the members to order, that
the meeting was held in accordance with
the general custom of bringing together
the members of the old and new commit
tees after the convention had completed
its work, in order to become acquainted
and that authority mignt be given to close
up the business in connection with the
convention, which now consisted largely,
if not altogether, of payment of expenses
incurred on account of its meeting.
He was happy to inform the members of
the committee that funds were in the
hands of the treasurer more than sufficient
to meet all the obligations that were out
standing and to return to the treasurer of
tne citizens' committee something of a
surplus lor distribution to the contributors
CHARACTERISTICS OF WILLIAM JENNINGS BRYAN.
Doesn't drink.
Doesn't smoke.
Doesn't chew.
Doesn't swear.
Doesn't pay cards.
Doesn't play billiards.
Doesn't ride the bicycle.
Doesn't know what it is to be revengeful.
Gets an idea and takes it for granted
that hejs right
to the fund. He recommended tbat for
this purpose the sub-committee of the
National Committee in charge of the
arrangements for the convention be con
tinued until its business be fully con
cluded, and this was ordered without
objection. He complimented the treasurer
of the local league for his efficiency and
success in accumulating the funds for the
payment of the convention expenses,
although it had been a difficult and some
what tedious job to get together the neces
sary amount of funds, but they were all in
band now and nothing more need be said
abcut that.
General Blair of Kansas, the oldest mem
ber of the committee in point of service,
except Mr. Sulloway of New Hampshire,
claimed the attention of the committee to
present resolutions of thanks to Chairman
Harrity for the impartiality, faithfulness
and singleness of devotion with which the
chairman of the committee had performed
the duties of his position, and to Secretary
Sheerin for his successful labors, always so
courteously and kindly giveu.
The resolutions were unanimously
adopted by a rising vote, and the chairman
and secretary made suitable acknowledg
ment of the compliments paid them.
Before the resolutions were adopted
Charles S. Thomas of Colorado and A. 8.
Clayton of Alabama seconded them,
highly eulogizing Sheenu and Harrity.
This having been disposed of Mr. Har
ritv suggasted that the roll of the new
committee be called, which was done and
their addresses recorded by Secretary
Sheenn. It was noticed that among the
absentees were the representatives of
New York, Rhode Island, Massachusetts,
Vermont, Connecticut and Maryland.
There being no further business before
the committee it adjourned.
Vvhile the committee was in session the
candidatesâ Messrs. Bryan and Sewallâ
came into the room and were heartily con
gratulated, but took no part in the pro
ceedings.
A few minutes later Mr. Harrity said he
had been requested to call the members
of the new committee to order. He was
made temporary chairman and Mr. Shee
rin was made temporary secretary. An
executive session was held.
Senator Wi.ite suggested that the
method followed four years ago be
adopted on this occasion and tbat the
candidates be notified at a ratification
meeting to be held in New York City
within a reasonable period of time, within
a fortnight or so.
Governor Stone of Missouri thought it
would be better to follow the lone custom
of both parties of notifying both candi
dates at their homes.
Mr. Bryan was called upon for an ex
pression of opinion and indorsed White's
proposition. He said he thought it would
be a good thing for the party if the candi
dates would go into the East, where he
explained the platform and candidates
had been generally misrepresented, so that
the candidates might be presented to the
people of that section and they might see
for themselves what manner of men they
were asked to vote for and the principles
for which they stood.
Mr. Sewall, who had been out of the
room temporarily, returned while Mr.
Bryan was sneaking and briefly expressed
his approval of what the Presidental can
didate had said.
The National Committee took a recess
at this point until 9 o'clock and a meeting
of the notification committee was held.
Tnis lasted half or three-quarters of an
hour, in the course of wnlch a proposition
to make the notification in accordance
with Senator White's suggestion and tne
approval of the candidates themselves
was discussed. The matter was finally
referred to a sub-committee of seven, con
sistine of Messrs. White, Plaisted of Min
nesota, Masters of Illinois, O'Donnell of
Colorado, Shields of Tennessee, Danforth
of New York and Holden of Ohio. They
will meet at Candidate Bryan's room at
the Clifton House on Monday at 9 o'clock
to make arrangements for the notification,
fixing the date, arranging the programme
of speeches, etc.
The committee reassembled at 9:30 and
Senator Jones of Arkansas was unani
mously chosen chairman. This selection
had been predetermined for some weeks.
The chairman was authorized to appoint
a temporary secretary, and he selected for
the position Hugo Wallace of Washington
State, a son-in-law of Chief Justice Fuller.
The attention of the committee for the
next hour was largely devoted to the de
tails of organization, the appointment of
sergeant-at-arms and other similar mat
ters. In the course of the discussion,
however. Senator Tillmau of South Caro
lina took occasion to express a few
opinions about the platform, stating his
belief to be that the men running npon it
would be successful without question.
ANTI-SILVER DEMOCRATS.
Cook County Leaders Mads Sad by
Being Left Alone In the
Wide West. '
CHICAGO, 111., July 11.â The Illinois
anti-silver Democrats, who have been
actively represented from the beginning
of the fight by Cook County party leaders,
were disappointed to-day to find they had
been practically left alone In the West to
meet and decide the question of another
Democratic National Convention. The
announcement last night Dy the Illinois
"Sound-money" Democratic League that
an address would be issued to the Democ
racy of the United States setting forth the
necessity for another Democratic conven
tion was expected to be followed by the
co-operation of the Eastern delegates.
The Eastern States did not make any
formal declaration in favor of the stand
taken by the Illinois and Texas gold
standard men. It was said in explanation
that many of the delegates had left for
their homes and that the prevailing senti
ment was to test the feeling of their people
on the question before openly declaring for
another convention. Franklin MacVt agh,
chairman of the committee to draft the
address, and other Cook County leaders,
expressed their disappointment at not re
ceiving prompt support from their Eastern
friends. The address is being prepared,
and may be issued Monday.

MILWAUKEE, Wis., July 11.âEx-Con
gressman Peter J. Somers, who has here
tofore been a gold man, announced his ac
tive support of Bryan. The Populists in
this city are enthusiastic in their indorse
ment of Bryan and favor his indorsement
at St. Louis July 22.

Is devoted to his wife.
Is happy in his home life.
Is particular about his dress.
Is not "stuck up."
Is as fond of talking to a street laborer
as to a Governor.
Has been thoroughly spoiled by admira
tion, in that he believes he knows all
there is to know.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 12, 1896.
COMMENT OF OUR
ENGLISH COUSINS,
Regard the Chicago Conven
tion as a Zoological
Curiosity
AND BRYAN AS A COWBOY
References to " the Despotism of
Lombard Street" Are
Not Understood.
BRITISH POLITICS TIRESOME.
Significance of the Reception to Bos
ton's Ancient and Honor
able Visitors.
LONDON, Eng., July 11.â Thus far Eng
lish journals, and English public also,
consider the Chicago convention much
more as a zoological curiosity than as a
serious political event. There is nothing
in their comment which would alter or
illume the opinions which our own
thoughtful men have formed about it. A
suggestion of cowboys ana bucking horses
and a tremendous fusillade of blank cart
ridges from the roof of the Dead wood stage
coach colors the general British concep
tion of the wild West, and youne Mr.
Bryan, the boy orator, becomes easily
associated in reminiscencej with the
leather-lunged person who used to an
nounce Colonel Cody's programme to
listening thousands at Earls court. As to
the vehement references in the Populists'
platform to British gold monometallism
and the oratorical references to "the des
potism of Lombard street," no one here
understands them or discusses them.
British politics have no loneer even the
merit of being picturesque. There is noth
ing remotely suggesting a circus or any
thing else amusing or remarkable about
Parliament. Those inside share with those
outside the common emotion of wearied
disgust. To-day it is said that there has
been a mistake in the steering of the
finance bill's earlier stages through the
House, which will necessitate a consider
able extension of the time allotted for its
discussion on report, and thus throw the
whole ministerial programme once more
into confusion. Tory members hear this
with merely another groan. Gross mis
management has come to be the expected
thing.
The Government sustained a grave
moral defeat over its scheme for forcing
India to pay the expenses of the troops
that England is borrowing from her for
use in the boudan. Twenty-three of the
most influential supporters of the Govern
ment voted openly against it, twice that
number refused to vote at all, and there
are not a dozen men in the whole 400 who
are not privately cursing the mean stupid
ity for this transaction. The blame for it
is laid entirely on the shoulders of Sir
Michael Hicks-Beach, who threatened to
resign if he *as not allowed to squeeze
this paltry sum out of India,
I have never seen a more general and out
spoken disaffection in any party organiza
tion than is to be witnessed now in the ma
jority at Westminster. Gerald Balfour has
made quite as melancholy a hash of his
chances as has his brother Artnur. His
weak attempt to please all sides with an
Irish land bill has finally evolved a sort of
monster which nobody will accept. De
bate on it begins Monday, but its fate is a
foregone conclusion, and its collapse will
probably shake some of the ministers out
of their seat-.
If this powerful Tory majority han any
leadership worthy the name it might have
had all its sessional business well in hand
by this time. As it is, chaos threatens
everything. So many people on all sides
are keen about the bill making the use of
motor carriages possible on highways that
it will probably get through, but there is
positively no certainty about anything
else.
The deceased wife's sister bill needs a
miracle in its behalf to secure a place in
the business schedule of the House of
Commons. Its backers profess to have a
slight hope that this will be attained, but
the chance is hardly worth discussing.
The final victory of this measure in the
House of Lords yesterday was largely
helped by the disclosure of a circular letter
which Cardinal Vaughan bad sent to the
Catholic peers telling them that the Pope
wanted the bill beaten. This interference
of an Italian priest in English legislation
comes at just the time to make everybody
furious. Englishmen were already angry
about the recent Anglo-Saxon flirtation
with the Vatican and about a report that
the Jesuits are to start a college at Oxford
inside the university system and if any
thing could interest them in setting all
else aside and shoving this measure
through the Commons it would be the
knowledge that Rome would take it as a
slap in the face.
The most interesting feature of the week
in continental politics has been the per
sistent reports from various Levantine
sources that a French occupation of Cy
prus is under discussion at Constantinople.
Most of these rumors suggest that Russia
urges this upon France and that both of
these nations are pressing it on the Sultsn.
For many reasons the story seems like a
"ballon deesai" rather than like a reflec
tion of aciual facts; but even if it is merely
put forth as a feeler it has some value.
Turkey continues to fall in pieces. Each
week brings new reports of troops mutiny
ing, and the provincial governments are
lapsing into anarchy. It is plain that mat
ters cannot go on indefinitely as they are,
and as the critical time approaches each
suggestion of possible action by one or an
other group of powers gathers fresh im
portance.
To-morrow's secondary elections in Bel
gium have taKen on new interest, owing to
the movement started at the last moment
inside the Liberal party to cast its vote as
between two evils for socialism rather than
lor clericalism.
Last Sunday's elections revealed the
clericals as about holding their own, with
a considerable plurality over the socialists.

but they have no actual majority because
of the much smaller Liberal minority.
When this happened tne last time the
Liberals on the Second ballot threw their
votes to the clericals and put them in
power. Now, after two years' experience
of priestly rule, they ask themselves
whether even socialism is not preferable,
and their leading journals for the past
week have been urging that it is. Hence
to-morrow's results may have some inter
esting surprises.
From many points of view it would be
easy to exaggerate the international sig
nificance of the joyous good time which
all classes of Londoners are conspiring to
give the Ancient and Honorable visitors
from Boston. Individually they are types
of the Americans who have always be"n
delighttully welcomed here by all who had
the chance of meeting them.
Their comma in a body, with guns, flags
and that superb Salem Cadet bandâ which
knocks everything Londoners are in the
habit of hearinpâ has simply multiplied
this chance of extended hospitality to an
indefinite decree. Their hosts are already
looking rather pallid and used up, but the
guests are still as brieht ns a dollar. They
know the whole royal family and a good
pp.rt of the peerage by sight, and as for
the Prince of Wales, he seems to be an old
friend to them. It was delightful to note,
when they met for the first time Thurs
day evening, with what electric swiftness
both the Prince and the visitors recognized
that they were made for one another. All
through the evening the Prince wore a
broad and unctuous smile â like nothing
else so much as it was like the grin on the
conventional effigies of King Gambrinusâ
and the Ancients could hardly eat dinner
for their eagerness to be up on their feet,
splitting the air with yells of affection for
this admirable good fellow, who wore his
blue-garter sash with ordinary evening
clothes and miniature orders on his lapel
to give the occasion its highest possible
note of formal importance, but at the
same time to make it all seem free and
easy.
So immense was the crush of notables at
this huge feast, that men like Chauncey M.
Depew and Henry Irving had incon
spicuous seats at a side table there. They
were sandwiched in among London

privates who had never heard of Mr.
Depew and had never seen Irving save
from the shilling-gallery. The privates of
the London Honorable Artillery gave little
anxiety to those who knew them best at
the outset, for they are socially of a vastly
different grade from the Boston visitors,
and this generally makes things awkwara
in England; but, thanks to the wild whirl
of activity imposed on everybody by the
programme, there was time for nothing
but ardent and sustained cheerfulness all
around.
Mr. Bayard's noble speech caught these
young clerks and shopmen of London.
Open-mouthed in wonder and admiration,
ihey cheered him and all his words about
the common ties of the two lands as they
probably never had cneered anything be
fore in their lives, and the Bostonians were
equally vociferous.
It was the Prince of Wales, however,
who was the real hero of the occasion,
and who along with the- Princess â who
yesterday made the pretty point of hav
ing the stars and stripes brought to her
and fondling the silk in her bands â will
remain uppermost in the memory of the
Ancients.
Nothing has been lacking to prove what
I insisted on last January that, so far as
the court here is concerned, it is pro
foundly anxious to maintain the warmest
relations between the two countries. A
I century ago it was the court wnich hated
the American and the politicians who de
plored this hatred. George Ill's only liv
ing grandson, the Duke of Cambridge,
still rather snares this ancestral feeling,
but his cousin Victoria has another view,
and her son and heir goes so much farther
in the same direction that by comparison
the modern English politicians seem
almost anti- American.
Madagascar, I am told, is destined to
figure very prominently in Anglo-French
discussions during the next few montns.
There is a concerted effort on the part of
the smali French colony of office-seekers
and contract-mongers out there to get rid
of the resident General Laroche, whose
double offense is that he is learning the
urgent native problem and is resolutely
extending fair play to ths English-speak
ing missionaries on the islani. It is pos
sible that Laroche may keep via place,
though this is dependent on the vicissi
tudes of home politics. But it is morally
certain that the English-speaking mis
sionaries will have to get out Already
their position is very unpleasant, and the
French colonial party is egging on the
colonists to render that position insuffera
ble. It is the fact that they teach English
in the native schools to which objection is
chiefly made, and by fair means or foul,
this is bound to be stopped. America, it
is understood, is quite aa directly affected
by this as England is, but it is not thought
that even joint remonstrances from Wash
ington and London will produce any re
sults.
The news that the Duke of Wellington
is seriously ill had served to recall to the
public the fact that this great title is not
extinct. The present Duke, during the
twelve years of his incumbency, has hardly
been mentioned in public hearing. All
that is said of him now is that physically
he presents an extraordinary likeness to
the late Mr. Spurgeon in his latter years
of gross unwieldiness of bulk and swollen
features.
Cardinal Bourret's obituary notices al
lude to the fact that he is the Cardinal
Bergerot of Zola's "Rome." Americans
could find even more striking analogies
for this venerable, sweet-souled. saintly
humanitarian in their own experience of
devoted prelates, who wear their hearts

TERRIBLE SLAUGHTER
Twenty â¢ Seven Persons Are
Killed Outright and Forty
Injured.
PARTIAL LIST OF THE DEAD.
Indescribable Scenes Follow the
Awful Crash â Carelessness of
an Eag.ine?r.
OMAHA. Nkbr., July 11.â An appalling
accident to an excursion train occurred this
evening at Logan, lowa, thirty-five miles
east of this city, on the line of the Chicago
and Northwestern Railroad, in which
twenty-seven persons, living in this city,
Council Bluffs. Mi^oi'.ri Valley and inter
vening points, were killed, and forty in
jured. Many of tho injured will, in all
probability, die before morning. A par
tial list of the dead is as follows:
Mrs. Moses Bando, Omaha.
Charles Heiman, 15 years old, Missouri
Valley.
Mrs. McMahon, Omaha.
John Perkins, Omaha.
Walter Jenning, Missouri Valley.
Peterson, waterworks engineer,
Council Bluffs.
Will Wilson, Council Bluffs.
Son of Bob Claire, a boiler-maker,Omaha.
John Cosgrove and daughter, Omaha.
John McDermntt, Omaha.
Patrick Scully, stationary engineer,
Omaha.
Miss Margaret Cosgrove, Omaha.
Lawrence, Omaha.
Peterson, Omaha.
Mrs. P. J. Carroll and son, Omaha.
Mrs. Bralley and baby, the former a
sister of Mrs. Carroll.
Dodson, boy, residence now un
known.
Mrs. Ncalson, Omaha.
PJerson, boy 13 years old.
William Summet, Missouri Valley.
Daughter of William Wilson, Council
Bluff s.
Among the fatally injured is J. A. Lillie,
president! of the Union Pacific Pioneers'
Association.
The train consisted of fifteen coaches
leaded down with membars of the Union
Pacific Association of Omaha and their
friends.
The excursion party left Omaha early in
the day, picking up recruits at Council
Bluffs, Missouri Valley and Woodbine,
lowa. Its destination was Logan, lowa,
which was reached about 10 a. m., and the
day had been pleasantly spent. About 7
o'clock the journey homeward was com
menced. The train had hardly passed
the limits of the city and was rounding a
curve when "down brakes" was whistled,
and then came a crash.
The excursion train had been run into
by a fast freight known as No. 38 and all
the coaches were ditched.
The scene which followed is indescrib
able. Both engines and the first passenger
coach were demolished. The shrieks of
women, the yells of men and the wails of
the injured and dying in the gathering
gloom rose above the crash of the heavy
machinery and tbe screeching of escaping
steam from the wrecked engine?. Tbe
engineers and firemen of both engines
jumped, and both crews escaped without
injury.
The conductor of the freight train,
Modelin, says he was running on orders,
and that the excursion train was not.
The engineer and fireman of the excur
sion train had disappeared after the col
lision, and this lends color to the story as
told by the freight conductor.
Immediately on receipt of the news in
Omaha a special train was made np and a
number of physicians and surgeons sent
to the scene of the wreck.
The news spread like wildfire and soon
the newspaper offices, depots and railroad
headquarters were besieged by a crowd of
frantic people, who had relatives on the
fated train and were hungry for the latest
news from the scene of the disaster. Sev
eral thousand people are spending the
night at the Union Pacific depot, await
ing the arrival of the train bearing tbe
dead and injured.
As fast as the names of tbe victims were
received at the World-Herald office they
were bulletined for the benefit of the anx
ious ones standing without. The scene
was a pathetic one in the extreme a*
friends read the names of loved ones who
were either mangled in the wreck or badly
wounded. Several women fainted and had
to be taken home in carriages.
The Union Pacific Pioneers' Association
is composed of the employes of the Union
Pacific system. The larger portion of them
work in the Union Pacific shops in this
city, and, as a rule, have large families de
pendent upon them.
Latest accounts say it Is possible that
fifteen will complete the dead list. Ten
bodies are stretched out near where the
wrecked engines are piled up, and some
can be seen pinned under tbe demolished
coaches. It is nearly impossible ia the
confusion to secure the names of the in
jured, which will reach nearly half a hun
dred.
Logan is a small town and the tele
graphic facilities are limited. A corps of
reporters and telegraph operators has left
here for that place. Two relief trains tent
to Loean from this place will probably
reach here on their return trip early Sun
day morning, and until then the full de
tails will not be known.
Those of the injured who are able to be
removed will be brought to this city to
night. The dead are being taken to a local
undertaking establishment, where an in
quest will be held over the bodies.

CHICAGO'S HOLD-UP CARNIVAL
Seven Robberies Up to Midnightâ One
Officer Killed and the Police
Force Demoralized.
CHICAGO, 111., July 11.â One hold-up
after another has been reported to the po
lice to-day until the number at midnight
reached seven. The police department is
In an uproar.
Officer Saver of the East Chicago-avenue
station prevented one robbery at Division
and Western streets at a late hour, but
was shot and fatally wounded. Four men
armed with revolvers entered the oflice of
the New York Biscuit Company at noon
to-day, held up the cashier at the muszles
of their pistols and seizing the money pre
pared to meet the payroll, made off with
it. The robbers secured over $2Oi'O and
escaped.
The offices of tne company are at Ran
dolph and Morgan streets, and there were
400 people In tho building at the time.
Clerk Edward Hines sat close beside the
money, ana when the bookkeeper's m
closure swung open and a man entered
Hines thought he was a telephone-repair
man. A moment later he was astonished
to see two revolvers pointing at him.
"Stay where you are," cried the robber,
who immediately scooped in the money
on the desk and placed it in a sacs. Then
the thief with a sack in one hand and a
pistol in the other backed through the
door of the private office and departed
tnrough the other door to Morgan street.
At the time his three companions left by
the other two doors. i>one of the robbers
were masked.
Another hold-up was prevented by an
officer on Twelfth -street viaduct at an
early hour this evening and one of the
robbers was arrested.

was robbed by two boys with revolvers,
who had evidently been reading about the
"long and short men."
Later a saloon at Fifty-first and Atlantic
streets was robbed by armed highwaymen.
Tbe highwaymen have all escaped with
the exception of the one captured on the
viaduct.
While the North Side police were con
centrating their efforts to find the slayer
of Sergeant Saver three men held up the
saloon of J. McHale at Erie and Market
streets and secured $40.
Tnree men with hnndkerchiefs over
their faces attempted to hold up Police
Officer Tobus Sardstrum to-night at the
corner of Fifty-first and Princeton streets.
Two of the men presented their revolvers
at Sandstrum and ordered him to throw
up his bands. Instead of throwing up his
hands the officer knocked up the revolvers
of the two men and drawing his own gun
ordered them to surrender. The third
man ran, but the two with revolvers stood
still with their revolvers in the air. Sand
struni then marched his prisoners to the
station with his revolver leveled at them.
They ga.ve the names of John Wells and
Red Fitzpatrick. Weils is recognized as a

Deputy Sheriff Renson of San Jose Visits
the Bicycle Thief Held at
Fargo.
FARGO. N. D., July 11.â Deputy Sheriff
Fred Benson of San Jose, Cal., arrived
here to-day to see if he could identify
George Dalton, held in jail here for bicy
cle stealing, as James Dun hair tbe multi
murderer of San Jose. He found Dalton
was not the much-wanted man, though he
bore a remarkable resemblance to him. A
photograph sent by the local authorities
had been subjected to a microscopic com
parison with one of the murderer, and
there were so many similar features that
Benson came here to see the prisoner.
Dalton claims to be the son of a wealthy
Boston furniture manufacturer, and says
he was disinherited because of a foolish
marriage.

Retire.

TRIPLE ALLIANCE TREMBLES.
Dr. Koch Investigates and Says There
Is No Asiatic Cholera in
Dtfttxtg.
BERLIN, Germany, July 11.â It is now
definitely settled that General Bronsart
yon Scheilendorf, Minister of War, will
retire from the Ministry soon after the
return of the Emperor from his present
trip to the Nordland. After having twice
offered his resignation, General Scheilen
dorf has finally succeeded in obtaining the
assent of the Emperor to his retirement
from office.
It is reported that the Kaiser has found
a suitable successor to the present Minis
ter of War in General Funck, who is at
present commander of the fourteenth
division of the German army, with head
quarters at Dusseldorf.
In official circles it is expected that
other official changes will accompany the
retirement of General Scheilendorf, and a
great deal of speculation is being indulged
in as to their nature and extent. Prince
yon Hohenlohe, the Imperial Chancellor,
before starting on his holiday trip to his
schloss at Ausse, in Austria, made no con
cealment in private conversation with his
intimates of his readiness to retire from
the chancellorship when the Emperor
would permit him to do so, and rumor
also mentions Freiherr Marschal yon
Bieberstein, Minister of Foreign Affairs,
and Dr. yon Boetticher, Vice-President of
the Council of Ministers, Minister of State
and Imperial Secretary of State for the In
terior, as amoug those who are about to
lay down the cares of official life.
It is improbable, however, that there is
any truth in these rumors unless the
Kaiser is determined upon an entire
renovation of the Cabinet, implying an
alteration of the general policy of the
general government.
It is a notable fact that in all the current
political gossip in regard to the Cabinet
changes the name of Dr. Miquel, Prussian
Minister of Finance, is not mentioned,
whereas a few months ago he of all the
other members was believed to have the
slightest hold upon his office.
Everybody now accepts it as a fact that
bis position is secured, and it is probable
that the Emperor will confine his changes
in the Ministry to the retirement of Prince
Hohenlohe and General Schellenctorf. The
I retreat of the latter is a signal triumph
j for the coart generals, especially General
yon Hahnke, chief of the Emperor's mili
tary cabinet, whose unyielding opposition
to the scheme of reform in the procedure
in military trials bas been a thorn in the
side of General Schellenuorf, for many a
day.
The Hamburger Nachrichten, the organ
of Prince Bismarck, publishes an article,
plainly bearing the marks of having been
dictated by the ex-Chancellor, upon the
subject of Italy's position in the Dreibund,
which is exciting widespread discussion.
The article points out that the maintenance
of relations between Austria and Italy is
the chief source of anxiety to Germany
just now, for the reason that if Italy with
draws from the triple alliance the military
r. sources of Austria will be so restricted
by the necessity for euarding the Italian
fontier that she will be unable to fulfill
"her contract to help Germany with the
whole of her army.
Tbe Austrian alliance, the article adds,
would thus lose so much of its worth to
Germany as to cause it to become question
able whether it would be of any value
whatever as a thing to be relied upon.
Emperor Francis Joseph of Austria has
arranged to pay a visit to King Charles of
Roumania at Bucharest in September.
The event will be one of high state im
portance, as a demonstration in response
to ihe formation of the League of Balkan
States, under the control of Russia.
The Emperor will meet Oscar of Sweden-
Norway, at Drontheim in Norway on July
23L The Empre^s started for Wilhelmsruhe
with her two eldest sons, Crown Prince
William and Prince Eitel Frederick, yes
terday. Her Majesty and the Princes will
reside at the schloss in Wilhelmsruhe dur
ing the absence of the Kafcer on his Nord
land trip.
Prince Henry of Prussia, brother of the
Emperor, and his wife. Princess Irene, are
ayingat their new estate in Himmel
mark. Princess Irene is in a delicate con
dition and her accouchment is expected
to occur very soon.
The Emperor will send Prince Henry to
London to represent him at the royal
wedding of Prince Charles of Denmark
and Princess Maud of Wales, which will
take place on July 23.
Dr. Koch went to Dantzcig on Wednes
day to investigate the case of cholera
which was reported by the health authori
ties of that city to be one of the genuine
Asiatic type. Dr. Koch denies that it is
Asiatic cholera, although in his examina
tion tbe comma baccileus was detected.
The case, he decides, is traceable to im
pure water. Stringent pr cautions against
cnolera have been taken by the authori
ties at Danzeig.

Thirty Thousand Visitors in the City of
Washington, and They Are Still
Coming.
WASHINGTON. D. C, July 11.â Thirty
thousand visitors is the number reached
up to this time in the registration booths
of the fifteenth annual international
Christian Endeavorers' Convention, now
in session here.
Secretary Baer stated to-day that this
convention would outnumber in delegates
that, of any convention ever held, if the
registrations from within the State were
not counted. This he considered a fair
basis of comparison, as States like Massa
chusetts are exceedingly strong in Chris
tian Lndeavor societies.
Following the preliminary sunrise
prayer-meetings in thirty-rive churches
and the Bible book study in the New
YoriJ-avenue Presbyterian Church, the

OUR DEBT TO THE SURVIVORS.
Tne Orator Declares Too Mnch Can
not Be Done to Provide for
Their Comfort.
YOUNTVILLE, Ual., July ILâ The
new social hall at tue State Veterans'
Home was dedicated with impressive cere
monies to-night. Nearly all the members
of the Veterans' Home Association, in
cluding the board o! directors, were pres
ent, and 200 invited guests added grace
and brilliancy to the occasion. The as
sembly hail, on the lower floor of the
handsome new building, was the scene of
the festivities, and the presence of nearly
all t c able-bodied old "vets" at the borne
swelled the audience to nearly half a
thousand. Several rows of seats in the
tront part of the hall were occupied by the
honored guests from San Francisco and
the surrounding valley.
The ceremonies were opened by intro
ductory remarks by the commandant,
Colonel George W. Waits. He spoke
briefly of the occasion, saying that the
board of directers. in its ever faithful
kindness, bad provided a place of conveni
ence for the veterans, and that their ap
preciation would be shown in no better
way than by commemorating the opening
of the new building with an entertain
ment,
With these few words be announced the
first number of the evening's programme,
a song by the Napa Glee Club, whose ef
forts were so satisfactory that an encore
was insisted on.
Preceding the leading event of the even
ing, the dedication oration by the well
known orator, Samuel M. Shortridge, reci
tations were rendered by Miss Ames,
Scnooi Superintendent of Napa County,
and Mrs. Nellie Holbrook Bhnn.
Mr. Shortridge was greeted enthusias
tically when he stepped onto the stage.
He began by paying a glowing tribute to
the old veterans.
"I bow first to the soldiersâ the veterans
âand next to the nag, that noble banner
which these old soldiers helped to save,"
said he.
After greeting the ladies and other mem
bers of the audience in a happy manner
he continued:
"I, like all the younger generation, did
not have the opportunity and privilege of
exhibiting my loyalty and patriotism, as
did the old soldiers; but gratitude is the
purest flower that olooms in the human
heart, and the men or women who do not
feel most grateful in their hearts for these
noble men do not deserve to enjoy the
liberty which their valor preserved for
them. Loyalty and devotion to the nag is
the ereatest virtue that can adorn a man's
nature."
Speaking of that loyalty as vindicated
by the old soldiers present, he said:
"I see now before me, with bowed head
and form, many of you who are perhaps
suffering from physical weakness; but we
may all feel that the loyalty which Jed
you to leave your homes and families and
business to preserve this grand Union
glows as brightly and steadfastly as ever,
and ca> never be extinguished."
An eloquent and feeling tribute was
paid to those who died for the Hag â the
unknown dead, who fill unmarked graves.
"They are dead," he said, "and we cannot
give them the praise and glory they de
serve; but how they fought! Yes, they
occupy unmarked graves, which we can
not grace with flowers, but they live in the
Book of Li c. A thought always comes to
my mind on Memorial Day, and that is,
Was it worth all this? Is this flag, the
freedom which it symbolizes in history,
worth the lives â the countless lives â sacri
ficed on the gory field of battle and
scenes of carnage ? Is it ? Yes a thousand
times. When we think of the disruption
of the Union the heart is almost appalled
at the imagined spectacle. The veterans
here before us prevented such a disruption.
They, like many who sleep in peaceful
and hallowed graves, left home and busi
ness to maintain tho grand old flag. They
went forth not as destroyers to carry mis
ery and destitution in their path, but as
saviors, and these arms that raised the
Stars and Stripes on high would even now,
though some are palsied with age, be the
first in action to keep it there.
â¢'But let us not foreet the brave mothers
who sent their first-born forth to do battle
and die for their Nation's liberty, nor the
tender and loving wives who saw their
loved ones ana sole support go forth to
meet their country's foes. This is a grate
ful Nation ; it will not forget its soldiers,
nor those left dependent by its dead de
fenders, and the Nation's treasure would
be drained of its last dollar before our
country's brave women should be allowed
to suffer. And let me say again that tnose
who have no gratitude in their hearts for
the brave veterans do not deserve to enjoy
the liberty which they helped to preserve;
and if there are any who do not honor
those who died for that liberty they do
not deserve the light of day or the peace
of God."
He jpoke of the home as one of the prac
tical evidences of gratitude felt by the
people for the noble services performed by
the 500 who enjoyed its comforta and
pleasures and expressed a fervent wish
that they mieht live long to enjoy their
well-earned peace and rest.
"We are here to dedicate this building
and to thank the directors and those in
charge for the kind and intelligent man
ner in which they discharged their duties
and to thank them for the care and pains
they are taking in providing for the pleas
ure and comforts of the old soldiers. You
did much for us," turning to the veterans,
"and we want to show ourselves grateful.
We want to prove ourselves worthy of all
thut you did and suffered for us and the
liberty we now enjoy."
Before bringing his oration to a close Mr.
Shortriiite adverted to the historic idols
of the late war, each name being greeted
with a salvo of applause. He grew elo
quent in bis ealojzium of the bravery of
the private soldier in the ranks, giving it
a grander rating than that of general or
glorified leader. Theirs was to do and die,
be said, perhaps to fill nameless and un
known graves for their country's safety,
without reward or recognition. In closing
he said:
"Let it be your joy and consolation to
know that the deeds you performed were
not for a day, but for all time. Let it be
your joy and consolation to know that you
did something to make the world better
for your having lived. So long as the
rivers run to the ocean, so long as the
flowers bloom in this beautiful land, so
long as patriotism dwells in the human
heart, your deeds will not be forgotten."
A few words from the commandant at
the conclusion of Mr. Shortridge's oration
called forth the rousing ovation that the
old veterans were keeping back with an
effort. A recitation by Miss J. Cranston
and music by the Glee Club brought the
programme to a close. The following
members of the directorate and the asso
ciation were present: President, S. J.
Loop; vice-president, J. D. Barnett; treas

Philip DeideÂ»heimrr Claims He Was
Robbed of i* Fortune. â 
- SANTA BARBARA. Cal., July 11.â
Philip Deidesbeimer to-day brought suit
against William W. Hollister, A. N. Butte
et a!, tcvrecover. 16,666% shares of mining
stock in the Golden Gate Mining and Mill
ing Company . or it 3 value, estimated to
exceed $40,000, together with exemplary
damages in the sum of $10,000.
The complaint states that Deidesheimer
owned a sixth interest in certain claims
situated in the Camp Flood raining dis
trict of Utah, consisting .of the Mabel,
Noonday, Grasshopper and Gold Dipper
lodes. It is charged that at a certain
time Hollister, , then '.president of : the
company, came to the \ plaintiff,
and, under the pretense that such
a procedure would facilitate a sale of the
property, induced him to transfer to him
all of his stock; that this transfer was
made in the presence of witnesses
and was Â» clearly . understood to be
only, a formal transfer, the property
right being still vested in himself;
that thereupon Hollister transferred this
property to hi3Â»wife Augusta, this tranfer
being a fraudulent one, for no valuable
consideration and its object being solely to
deprive Deidesheimer of his rights.
Butts, the mining manager, is then said
to have entered into a fraudulent scheme to
purchase the stock, afterwards selling the
entire capital stock of the company to one
John 'Doe Del mar for a sum exceeding
$76,000. â â â â ..-
SANTA BARBARA SEARCH,
Trail of Cyrus Barnard's Com
panion Followed to Cali
ente Canyon.
Evidence That the Slayer of the Rich
ardson Women Was Aided
by an Accomplice.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., July 11.â
Bheriff Hicks of Santa Barbara County is
besieged by people who believe they have
clews to the Richardson murder mystery.
The feeling Is general that a sufficient re
ward should be offered for the discovery
of the murderer or of evidence positively
establishing the guilt of Barnard, the sus
pect slain while resisting arrest. It is un
derstood that Sheriff Hicks has offered a
$250 reward from his own private funds.
It was reported to the Sheriff to-day
that, at 8 :30 Monday morning, Cyras Bar
nard was seen in company with a man on
the boulevard near Booths HilL The man
was small and bad a short, dark beard,
brown or black clothes and a brown or
black felt hat.
'This man was : seen opposite 'the Rich
ardson house, on the Summerland . road,
where he took a long inspection of the
place and then returned toward the ceme
tery. ; :.Â«!>;: 'â â  '. . .... : v , â  . â¢> â¢;?'â â¢ â '.â : â¢:â %>-â¢
It was . discovered that Barnard's old
mountain camp was in the Caliente Can
yon, at the headwaters of the Santa Inez
River, across the mountain range. Think
ing that if the stranger were an accom
plice he might make for this place, a man
went up to examine the trails, and in the
course : of his investigations found tracks
resembling Barnard's going up to the
mesa, where he could have overlooked the
! actions of trackers.
In Romero Canyon was found a Mexi
can who reported that some one on
horseback went over the trail at mid
night on Sunday. He found the . track
of one shod and one unshod horse and
followed it to Blue Canyon, and through
the most devious and unaccountable
wanderings and doublings up and down
the river, finally to Caliente Canyon,
again doubling, it â¢â  went up the river fif
teen miles, where it was lost. He is sat
isfied that on the trail Barnard's compan
ion of Monday morning would be found.

! TEE CITY CLAIMS ITS OWN.
Refuses to Permit an Opposition Cor
poration to Make Further Use
of Its Pole 3.
TACOMA, Wash., July ILâ Mayor Faw
cett, City Electrician Bachelet and a squad
of policemen at 3 o'clock this morning
went to the residence part of the city and
began cutting the elestric-light wires of
the commercial Electric Company from
the city poles, on which they were strung.
When the city acquired the light plant
three years ago sixty days' notice was re
quired before the wires could be molested:
but Mayor Fawcett claims a notice given
in March, 1895, was sufficient, though not
then enforced.
The cutting of the wires was continued
to-day until the Commercial Company's
service in the residence section was de
stroyed.
The Commercial Company secured from
Judge Pritchard this afternoon an order
restraining the city from further destruc
tion apd from interfering with the com
pany's replacing the wires thrown down.
This order is returnable Monday morning.
The company then started to put up
wires, but late in the afternoon it was
stopped by an order issued by Judge
Stalloup restraining the company from
stringing wires on poles owned by the
city. The company's officers are dodging
the service of this injunction until after
midnight, and apparently intend to take
advantage of Sunday by putting up the
wires when legal service cannot be had.
The workmen hid themselves, in order
! that the injunction might not be served
upon them.
This fight is the outcome of heated com
petition between the city plant and the
Commercial Company for lighting con
tracts. The latter's franchise was procured
shortly before the city acquired the Ta
coma Light and Water Company's plant,
I and it is now operated by men who were
largely interested in the old water com
pany. This afternoon the city has secured
many new customers, the pa.rons of the
Commercial being left in darkness.

FRESNO, Cal., July 11.â Little Carolina
Lebmann was probably fatally shot about
9 o'clock last nipht by an unknown man,
who undoubtedly intended to murder her
lather. Mr. Lehraann was on the way to \
his sawmill in Crann Va.Uey, Madera ,
County, and his daughter, who is only
13 years of ape, was with dim. As they
were driving along Blackstone avenue,
three miles north of this city, a man who

one :-hot in tue hip from the first discharge. \
but the whole of tlie second charge struck â¢

No. 2 shot, and twenty of these pierced
tbe girl's back, head and arms.
Lehrnnnn was driving a fractious team, j
He was in front ot Etigerly's place on '
Blackstone avenue tthen he saw the man [
ctttaing on foot with a shotgun over his
shoulder. Lebmann says he heard tne '
fellow whistlinÃ before he saw him. His

Lehmann was forced to give his attention
to the tenm. Just as the man was passing '

at the occupants. The horses became un- |

considerable distance in the r ar and he ,

intended for himself. He had a slight diffi
culty with his laborers at the mills, but he
says he cannot imagine who would want
to kill him. He noticed as he passed that
the fellow was of medium size, heavy in
weight and wore a white shirt.
Bheriff Scott went to tbe scene of the
shooting immediately after it occurred,
but could iind no trace of tbe stranger.
The authorities have been working on the
case to-day, but discovered no clew. The
tracks of the man with the gun were fol
lowed from the road into an adjoining
vineyard, but there they were lost. The
people are much excited over the dastardly
shooting of the little girl. It is feared she
will die.
GLAUS SPRECKELS TALKS
Out and Out for McKinley and
Says He Will Sweep the
Country.
Ti Iman and Altgeid Ought to Be
Hanged and Senator White
Needs Scolding.
NEW YORK, N. V., July IL-Claus
Spreckels, the sugar king of California,
with his wife and daughter, arrived here
from Europe last night by the American
liner Bt. Louis. He intends to open a new
sugar factory on the Pacific CoaEt, and by
means of improved machinery will pro
duce 3000 tons of euear a day, at a cost of
$12,000, which will be paid to the beet
farmers of California and neighboring
States. Mr. Spreckels declares that here
after all tbe sugar used in the country
will be raised here and made out of beets.
He declares thai he is an out-and-out
McKinley man, and was sure, after hear
np of Bryan's nomination on a silver
platform, that tbe Republican party nomi
nee would sweep the country.
"The holders of United States bonds
payable in coin in foreign countries expect
to be paid in gold," said Mr. Spreckels,
"and they should be. An American dollar
should be worth 100 cents in Europe as
well as at home. This 60-cent business
will never do. It would ruin our credit and
bankrupt tbe country. The silver craze
has made the people who buy their oonds
in England a little shaky, but tney never
theless expect to be paid for them in gold,
and certainly will be.
"I will bet all I am worth that McKinley
and the gold standard will carry the day.
Tillman and Altgeid ought to be banned,
and when I get back to California I will
be after Chairman White of tbe Demo
cratic National Convention with a red-hot
stick. The people need not feel the slight
est alarm. Insanity is not going to rule this
country, and gold for a long time to cone
will remain the standard coin of the United
States."
SJI/lf BERNARDINO INJUNCTION.
The Southern Pacific Company Restrained
From Violating the Terms of a
. Franchise.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cat-., July 11.â
The injunction issued by Judge Campbell
to prevent the conversion of the Southern
California Motor Road between San Ber
nardino and Colton into a standard South
ern . Pacific . track and - grade was . served
upon " Colonel Wilson, tbo right-of-way
agent, and Mr. Deyarmon, the local agent,
late last ni?ht. These officers deny that it
was the intention of the Southern Pacific
to lay heavy rails or change the grade un
til an amended franchise had been granted
by the Board of Supervisors. A petition
to that effect :is now before that body.
They assert that the company is willing to
abandon the Colton-avenue line, for which
it paid $125,000, provided a right of way is
given by citizens over another route. â 
By the terms of the injunction ten days
were given the company to make answer
why the injunction 1 should not be made
perpetual. The question is exciting much
interest emong the people generally, and
especially among the residents along Col
eon avenue. This is one of the hnest roads
tn the county, and the adjoining property
owners claim, that the Southern Pacific's
encroachment would practically ruin their
possessions. ' j !
H. E. Huntington, vicÂ«-president of the
Southern Pacific Company, who recently \
returned from the southern part of the
State, appeared to be little disturbed in
mind over the injunction proceedings in
agurated at San Bernardino.
"They are going to a great deal of use
less trouble down there," he remarked
yesterday. "Their injunction don't give
us the least bit of anxiety. They don't know
what they are about; that* i.= all there
is to it. We can lay any kind of rails we
please along that road, and operate any
kind of trains that we may decide to put
on. That is a county road, and the gen
eral law of the State permits us to con
struct and operate a railroad on any
county road in the State."

DROWNED AT LOVELOCK.
Four-H 'ear-Old Millie Lovelock Dies jn
a Vain Attempt to Rescue a
Baby Brother.
LOVELOCK, Net., July 11.â One of the
saddest events in the history of this little
town was the accidental drowning on
Monday last of Millie and George Love
lock, children of Mr. and Mrs. Frederick
Lovelock, and grandchildren of George
Lovelock, the founder of tne town.
George, a sturdy little fellow of 3U sum
mers, was playing on the banka of the
creek with his favorite dog, when
the animal playfully pushed him
j iuto the water. His sister Millie
| just one year bis senior plunged troktly
: into the stream, heroically bent on saving
j h^r brother, and she. too, was drowned.
The loud barking of the dog attracted the
attention of neighbors. The mother of
tbe children arrived in time to see the life
less body of her daughter floating down
i Ihe creek.
Tbe children were buried on Wednesday
i last, the entire town attending the funeral.
j Their bodies were placed in the same casket
| which was smothered beneath the many
lloral offerings of the friends of the be
i reaved parents.

ney F. T. Van Fleet, a brother of Justice
W. C. Van Fleet of the Supreme Court,
arose in his . sleep â at an early hour this
morning and walked out of his upstairs
bedroom window, falling a distance of
twenty fee , and sustaining injuries that

next door beard him fail and went to his
rescue. When they picked him up he was
unconscious, and bÂ« remained in that con
dition for eieht hours, with blood Issuing

strained. . ,
Van Fleet, when he recovered conscious
ness, could give no account of . the affair.
He said thai he returned last night from

children. He went to bed early, and that
is all he knows about it. Judge Van Fleet,

DICK HAVEY WINS
LAURELS AT UPJL
Drives Colonel Benton to a
Victory in the Pacing
Event.
LANDS A FORLORN HOPE.
Placed Behind the Horse After
It Had Been Beaten in
Two Heats.
HELENA BHOWS SOME SPEED.
The Daughter of Electioneer Takes a
Parse and Lowers Her
Record lo 2:14 12
NAPA, Cal., July 11.â The crack side
wheelers, W. Wood and Waldo J, did not
come together here to-day in the free-for
all pace, and great was the disappointment
of tbe big crowd that assembled at the
track to see the gray ghost of Santa Paula
and his bay rival do battle. Kay wood, the
third entry in the event, was brought ont
with a leg wrapped in bandages and was
excused by the judges. The directors of
the society then decided to declare the
race off, and bitter disappointment was
depicted on all faces. However, the other
two events on tbe card, tne 2:19 trot and
the 2:18 pace, furnished sport enough to
please the most fastidious.
ln the latter race a smash-up lirened tip
things and added additional luster to the
glorious uncertainties of the racing game.
In the third heat, while Estelie Wilkes,
Our Boy and Colonel Benton were fighting
for the pole, Banders, behind the first
named mare, attempted to get through a
knothole and succeeded in smashing the
wheel of Our Boy's bike.
Bunch, the driver ot the latter horse,
was compelled to drop the reins, and with
the demolished sulky striking his heels
Our Boy started on a wild run around tbe
course. Fortunately he did not collide
with any of the othor starters, and finally
stopped of bis own accord, considerably
the worse for wear ana tear. The bike be
hind Esteile Wilkes was disabled, and as
the judges thought Sanders at fault he
was declared distanced. Oar Boy started
in the next heat.
Tbe 2:19 trot, which was first on the
card, was taken in straight heats by
Helena, a matron from the Paio Alto
stock farm and the dam of two fins-look
ing foals, one by Wiidnut, the other by
Dexter Prince. She is a daughter of the
immortal Electioneer, and was again
rMÂ»r>o<i i n training this year through the
.;ient and foresight of Frank Covey,
the manager of the great breeding estab
lishment. 'Helena trotted each heat like a
veteran of the grand circuit, reducing her
record : from ' 2:lB^'. to 2 :l4J^, adding aft
otber Electioneer t0.the, 2:15 list. In the
pools the mare sold a red-hot favorite over
the field. '-. / . ' v,Â« .. -
Nutwood Wilkes was the. contending
horse in the hrst. two heat?, and his splen
did showing assuredly reflects credit on
hid colored driver, W. Cea9el, to whom the
horse's present fine form is due, after oth
ers had said "he wouldrr't do." â â -â¢.
The pace was the liveliest sort of a bet
ting altair. " In the -opening pools Colonel
Benton sold for $10, Our Boy 10 and field
$7. Our Boy drew pole, but failed to
hold his position. Allie Cresco. a2oto 1
shot for the heat, toot the lea t on - mat
ing the turn down. the. backstretch and
was never headed, passing the wire three
lengths ahead of Colonel Benton, in
2:l3}*. '. â¢
The winner, Allie Cresco. now Bold fa
vorite at $10 lor the. next heat, with the
Colonel next in demand at $8, -and the
field bringing $7. The daughter of Cresco
found no difficulty in repeating the trick,
ana took the second heat in 2:15, Colonel
Benton being uncertain on His pins.
" After this the judges did not like Driver
Crawforth's efforts behind Colonel Benton,
and the noted reiusrnan, Dick Havey, was
substituted. In the third heatilnvey
steered clear of the smash-up between Es
telle Wilkes and Our Boy, and got thÂ«
Colonel to the wire first un easy winner in
2:lB>Â£,wUh the runaway, Our Boy.' second.
Tne betting again switched "in" Benton's
favor, : ana Havey landed the necessary
two heats and capture.! hrst money. Aliio
Cresco took second money and Our Boy j
third. â  . :..-. â  â . â  : 3
This, is the second horse at the meeting
that Havey has brought in after the task
looked fruitless, and he is now considered
the peer of all the drivers on tue California
circuit. . .

SACRAMENTO'S WILD MAN
Whistling Pete, the SlayÂ«r of
Joseph Mitchell, Still
at Large.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., July 11 Whist
ling Pete, the murderer of Joseph Mitch
ell, has escaped the vigilance of the police,
and a feeling of unrest prevails the entire :
city. It has been found that six months
ago Pete tired a shot at another young
man who was walking along tbe street '
whistling, and in consequence all belated '
home-seekers are extremely careful not to
indulge in the pastime.
By documents found in tbe murderer's
cabin it is learned that his real name is
Daniel Graves, and that he has numerous
brothers and sisters living, presumably, in
seme Eastern State. Ihe police are chary
of information, as they believe that
should he escape he will return to the
home of his boyhood, where his capture
can be effected.
At the autormy to-day, it was found that
Mitchell had been shot twice, both bullets
entering to the lett of the point of the
lower maxillary, lodcing in the brain. The
police liave received information which,
leads them to believe that Whistling Pete
committed suicide shortly after killing his
victim. A man was seen to run rapidly
across the ievee a fear blocks from where
ihe murder occurred, and shortly after
disappearing in the tales a shot was
heard. This has not caused any relaxa
tion in the search, and policemen are sta
tioned in tbe vicinity of Graves' cabin to
arrest him should he return.

Lieutenant Betchcr Puts the Men of
ihe Reserve Through an
Ordna-ce Drili.
The monitor Camanche after twenty
years of sleep aroused herself Rip Van
Winkle-like yesterday and took a look
around her. The old ship saw that many
changes had taken place while she lay at
her moorings. Fleets in evolution had
sailed by her, and not even the swell of
their motion had disturbed her deep rest.
Scene Inside the Camanche's Turret Showing the Naval Reserve Drilled at the Two 15-Inch Guns
by Lieutenant Beecher of the Monadnock.
[Sketched by a "Call" artist.]
Steam has taken the place of sail and
wooden hulls have turned to steel while
j her own has gathered the shellclad barna
) cle and the saline vee< tation of the sea.
Yesterday her lonu stationary turret
wheeled on its pivot and her saw out
j through their narrow ports the Monad
'. nock lying near. As she was closing her
eyes twenty years ago at Mare L-land they
were rivptinp the new monitor's gretit
metal ribs in place, and tlien she shim
; bered while her young sister was growing
beam by beam and plate by plate. When
the Camanche awoke she saw the noble
white structure frowning at her from off
the starboard beam. And the two great
15-incii guns ran their amootli muzzles out
of the turret ami returned the frown. The
spirit of tbe fiery 'GO's lives in the ancient
marine yet.
It was Assistant Engineer Read of the
Monadnock, with a fireman and a coal
heaver, that stirred up the old fighter yen- j
terday. They turned some bay water into
an empty boiler, shoveled a couple ol tons
of coal into three furnaces, and noon the
steam was hissine In the auxiliary eiiÃine
and the great black funnel was smoking
likea blockade runner. Then Lieutenant \
J. M. Roper of the Monadnock took hip '
place in ihe' turret and threw back the j
revolving lever. There was an ominous j
movement in tbe cylinders, a trembling
down in the machinery, a groaning of the
great steel central abaft on which the

heavy mass turns, and the iron structure
whicli the Confederate tars on the Merri
mac called a cbeese-box when they fir3t
sighted the original monitor coming at
them, swung around.
The motion was slow on the first revolu
tion, but after the machinery got limbered
up it whined easily and swiftly with its
own great weight ana that of tne two big
15-inchers.
Lieutenant Roper trained the guns on
the Philadelphia' and then on his own
vessel and seemed to enjoy handling the
old-fashioned war toy.
"Turn on the steam again, Read," be
yelled to his brother officer after a short
pause, "and let us give her another whirl.
I haven't had so much fun for years. It's
good as a 'merry-go-round.' Get aboard
and let's have another ride."
So Engineer Reed opened the throttle
again and the lieutenant swung the turret,
himself and his passenger through all the
points of the compass.
Later in the afternoon Lieutenant-Corn
mader Turner and a number of the officers
and men of tbe Naval Reserve came
aboard. They were formed into crews ior
the two great guns and instructed in ord
nance by Lieutenant A. M. Beecher of the
Monadnock. The young fellows went
through the drill of loading, running out
â¦he pieces, firing, sponging, reloading and
training the guns of the revolving tur
ret with all the serious '-make believe" of
battle.
Down in the wardroom Lieutenant Tur
ner entertained the officers and newspaper
men at lunch and questioned Lieutenant
Roper upon the remaining warlike possi
bilities of the old monitor.
"Keeping tbe men aboard of the vessel
as much as possible," said tbe lieutenant.
"will make them thoroughly acquainted
with the monitor and their general ship
duties. I was talking with your signal
quartermaster when I first came aboard
and I found that he knew more about tbe
Cumancbe than I did and gave me a deal
of information. This craft is not by any
I means a useless old hulk, for her machin
j cry is in good condition and she affords an
; excellent drilling-place for the battalion.
Those two euns could be used at clot c
rantre with considerable efficiency.
"To fire a shell charge from them would
rip up the old aeck planking under th â¢â¢
muzzles of tha guns, but powder charges
could be fired in saluting easily and
safely."
Engineer Read stated that the boilers
and enginei were In splendid condition,
and a comparatively small amount oi
coal would drive her through the waters at
a fair speed.
Later in the evening the fires were
drawn, the steam died down and the old
craft was left to rest from her spurt with
only the anchor watch walkiifg the deck.

A RACE BETWEEN
OCEAN STEAMERS,
The Australia and City of
Peking Bound for Hono
lulu.
AN EXCITING CONTEST.
Another Attempt Was Made to
Raise the Blairmore, and
It Failed.
CAPfAIN BURNS
Narrow Escape of the Ferry Steamer
Sausalito From Going on Arch
Rock.
Tbe old and new style of the Monitor
were brouÂ£ht sharply into contrast. The
Monadnock that took twenty-one years to
build is nevertheless a modern ship in
every detail, but the Camanche that was
built in 1862 is now obsolete. These two
warships and the cruiser Philadelphia
form an object lesson. The. latter shows
speed in every line, while the Monadnock
is the symbol of strength. The Camanche
shows old age and decrepitude in every
part, but nevertheless she is built ot the
material that will stand repairing, and at
a pinch the old bo^t could be fixed up and
put in condition to fire another gun for
her country. Yesterday the three war
ships presented a remarkably handsome
appearance as the boats carrying the mem
bers of the Naval Battalion passed to and
from the Camancne.
The ferry steamer Sausalito had another
narrow esceD* yesterday. One of the
bucket? in her starboard paddle broke on
the early morning trip and the noise it
made in striking the paddle-box with each
revolution caused considerable consterna
tion unions the passengers. The steamer
was stopped and damages repaired, but
not before the tide had carried tSe Sausa
lito dangerously close to Arch Rock.
Several attempts have been made by the
Chamber of Commerce to get this menace
to navigation blown up, but Congress has
always refused to appropriate the money.
The Mail Company's City of Peking and
the Oceanic Company's Australia both left
for Honolulu yesterday. The Australia
had a five hours' start, but the engineers
on the Peking say they will beat her into
port and left the dock yesterday prepared
to push their vessel for all she is worth.
The Australia was not in very good trim
for a race, as sbe was down at the stern.
Even with that disadvantage if she is
opened up she will win hands down. On
the run up from Honolulu the Peking beat
tbe Australia's time by a little overr fou
hours, and the Mail Company now pro
poses to do it again. The Australia sailed
sharp at 10 a. m. and the .Peking backed
out from the docn on the stroke of 3 Â«\ m.
The Australia Dad the following cabin
passengers: L. C. Abies, Frederick Clift,
J. F. Eckardt, Mrs. William Clift, Miss
Abbie Bawrieu Clift, Miss M. Edwards,
Miss A. Fennane, R. C. Forsyth, Mrs. I.

bert and wife, Dr. J. M. Topmoeller, B.

The Peking had about thirty passengers
in the cabin and twenty-eight Chinese in
the steerage. Amone those in the cabin
were Lieutenants Calhoun, Barron, Gib
son and Lucien Young. Two of them will
join the gunboat Yorktown at Yokohama,
und the others the Detroit at Shanghai or
Hongkong.
The schooner Moonlight is now being
fitted ont for another cruise to Mexico.
She will take certain cargo for Mexican
ports, but the real purpose of her cruise is
to search for a guano island. Years and
years ago an old sailor gave Captain Bryan
the location of the island, but he never
thought of seeking for it until a year ago.
At that time tne Moonlight was ntted out,
and after an unsuccessful search returned
and was tied up in Oakland Creek. The
schooner Vine was the next one sent out,
and after her failure another expedition
was formed. Now Captain Joachimsen
has chartered th* Moonlight for another
search. On this occasion a different course
altogether will be steered, and ne hopes to
locate the much-coveted spot.
The sailor who gave the latitude and
longitude of the island was wrecked on it
nearly twenty years ago. They patched
their ship up and reached the Mexican
coast. Until thetalK of Clipperton Island
and its gunno deposits bepan to circulate
he never thought of the lonely rock in the
Gulf of California. When he realized its
value he told Bryan, and tbe first expedi
tion in search of it was begun.
The steam schooner Excelsior is on the
Merchants' drydock having a new bronze
propeller put in. Her owners are tirea of
using the old iron ones, as the blades were
constantly breaking and chipping.
In consequence of the transfer of Cap

nia several other chances were necessary.

steamer Willamette cannot sell her cargo,

Another attempt to raise the Blairmore
was made yesterday and another failure
resulted. The pumps again broke down
at the critical moment and the vessel again
sank into tbe mud. The men will be
given a rest to-day and a fresh start made
to-morrow.
Captain Hawley, the popular superin
tendent of the Spreckels Towboat Com

for the company's interests.
MADE A FIVE-DAY WEEK,
Another Move for Retrench
ment by the Railroad
Company.
Hours of Labor Reduced to Obviate
the Necessity of Laying Off
Any of the M n.
Another move in the direction of re
trenchment was made by the Southern
Pacific Company yesterday in the issu
ance of an order making a working week
consist of five days instead of the cus
tomary six. Work has been slack for
some time past, as is usual during the
summer months, and it has Seen a ques
tion of either laying some of the men off
or reducing the hours of labor. The lat
ter course was finally decided upon.
Hereafter, until further orders, Satur
day as well as Sunday will be a day of
rest for the employes engaged in the shops
of the railroad company in this) City, Sac-
I ramento, Oakland, Los Angeles and other
towns of the State in which are located
l reoair shops.
The new order of things went into
operation yesterday all ovar the State,
nnd affects in the neighborhood of 3000
men. a large majority of whom are em
ployed in Sacramento.
General Manager Julius Kruttscbnitt
had this to say regarding the situation:
"The new order will probably remain in
effect during the summer months, when
the earnings of the men are small at best.
Of course there are exceptions provided in
the order, which practically refers to the
workshops proper. The general wear and
tear of rolling stock and locomotives will
necessitate keeping the repair and naint
departments going at both Oakland and
Sacramento as heretofore."
Manager Fillmore explained matters as
follows:
"Instead of laying off a lot of men in
order to bring the expenses of the system
down to a reasonable figure, which would
no doubt have proved a hardship to many
of the men who have large families, we
concluded to give all the men a chance by
cutting out one day of the week's labor.
In this way all our workmen will have a
chance to earn wages and tie desired ends
will be accomplished by the company.
There will, however, be no change in the
hours of work."

LOCAL DEMOCRACY'S TWIN RATIFICATION.
Much Oratory, but Very
Little Red Fire and
No Parade.
DISAPPOINTED PEOPLE.
The Buckleyites Crowd Metro
politan Hall With Their
Meeting.
WOMAN SUFFRAGISTS ATTEND
Great Crowds Hear Little at the
Junta's Three Stands on
Grant Avenue.
The Democratic ratification of last night
Was a peculiar and a double-barreled one.
It was an experiment which should and
will be a lesson in party science.
Owinir to the local division in the De
mocracy and the absence of any orsanized
State party authority, each faction held an
independent ratification, and as each fac
tion felt too weak to undertake the getting
up of a grand procession, there was no
procession.
Now, a ratification of a National ticket
without a street parade ever so many
biockslong. which stops the streetcars for
an hour or so. burns the usual amount of red
and blue lire and displays a decent number
of banners doesn't satisfy the populace. A
ratification without a procession and with
nothing but a lot of speeches leaves the
thousands that crowd Market street on a
Saturday nicht hungry, weary, doubtful
and wondering.
That was the Democratic ratification of
last nisht. It aff> r.ied the speeches â mere
trimmings â but the regular visible, con
centrated, incarnate whoop was left out.
Market street was almost a pitiful scerfe
between 9 an I 10 o'clock. Thousands from
Kearny to Taylor street stood and waited
and yearned for the same old strutting
marshals, mounted and be-sashed, the
bands that in succession mysteriously
awaken a satisfying thrill two blocks
long. the same old files of
the boys who wouldn't excite anybody if
tney were on the sidewalk instead of m
twos on the cartrack, the red fire and the
crowding to the front on each others' toes.
The public seemed to have the idea that
there was to be a great Democratic time,
and at 10 p. m., when the last speakers at
Metropolitan Hall and at the Grant-avenue
stands were talking for t he wind-up,crowda
stood in tut m Uiie of Market street wait
ine for the red lire t'> come along.
It became painfully evident that the
genuine ratification should appeal to the
eye and to the nervous system.
Of the two ratifications the one at Met
ropolitan Hall, under the auspices of the
Buckley Democracy, waÂ» the most success
ful oneâ the one that made the most com
pact showing, the one that displayed the
most dignity and tue one that was mest
satisfactory to those who attended.
This was wholly due to the fact that
the Buckleyites held their meeting in a
hall where people couid hear what was
said and where order reigned.
The Buckleyitps attempted no proces
sion. During the day both factions had
out the regulation express wagons with
canvas signs and bells to advertise the
rueetines, neither side identifying their
ratifications.
One band played in front of Metropol
itan HaJl early in the evening, while bon
firn snapped and roared at Market and
31i>sion streets.
Before 8 p. m. Metropolitan Hall was
jammed Â«nd during the succeeding hour
â¢ Luiv.lreds came and crowded the aisles or
galleries or went away again. It was to
this ratification that the women suffra
gists, repre.-ented by Susan B. Anthony,
Miss Hny and Mrs. Harper, lent their
pre ence.
Here the eloquence of Col. O'Byrne, Jos.
Rothschiid, Reel B. Terry and other ora
tors was heard and applauded by the full
audience, ami here campaign songs found
an opportunity in the programme.
The Graut uvenue ratification, under the
auspices of the Junta, was an attempt at a
whoop which was attend d by juÂ«-t enough
red fire to draw an immense and curious
crow.i which could hear nothing within
ten feet of any of the islands ami which
had to be mainly satisfied with looking at
the rockets which two boyÃ let off during
the two hours' time from" the roof of the
Examiner office.
The troqnoii Club turned out sixty-eight
frtrung, and march d from 807 Market
Etreet with a band and with a number of
Roman candles. The band and the Roman
candles made as much noise and expect
ancy as though tise procession were a mile
Jon-, and the Market-street throng
thought t hut it was one of the mustering
china for the coming parade.
Three stands were erected on Grant
avenue, between Market and Geary
streets, one at each corner and one at the
middle of the biock. At these stands
Robert Ferral, ex-Congressman Clunie,
Kugene N. Deuprey and other Democratic
lights roared forth into the ni b 'ht air.
They were heard principally by the re
} ort'ers, who sat close to them in the little
stands with turned-up coatcoliars. Others
who heard them were those who could get
vithin ten feet.
Lauds played, the crowd talked, idled
and crushed about by itself. JuÂ»t after a
rocket whizzed from the Examiner office
< lie might have crowded in close, heark
ened intently aud caught from the shout
ing lips of "Robert Ferral, "Great God !
Has it come to this that you, who are
American citizensâ" and then when the
next rocket quit its fizz there would have
come, "B.end the silver and the gold
together."
If rue had made a dash two rods and
divd into the next crowd he might have
lieard Sam Brannhart, with eyeglasses
on nis nose and a strain on his lungs,
shout. " â signed by President Grant, wno
did not know that he was signing a bill de
luonetit ng silver."
Then at the next stand one might have
8-enClittis Barbour trying to get at the
crowd with his fists as he shouted in his
rape, "You'll be lucky if you get 10
tents on the dollar. '
And then turn and squeeze in to hear
vha'. that other fellow, with frantic fists,
i- shontins to the tenth man iv front of
Mm. He says, "Riehis of the colonies."
'All Europe," and "The rights of the peo
p c of the country."
Such was the Democratic ratification,
with its paucity of red fire and its abun
dance of eloquence.
WORDS OF REJOICING.
E'cquent SoeaKers Address a
Crowded Audience In Metro
politan Temple.
J joicing Democrats filled Metropolitan
Temple to the doors and beyond them at
the monster ratification meeting in the
evening, under the auspices of the Buck
lcrite faction of their oarty. Much en
thusiasm was manifested, the cheering
and arplause being at times absolutely
deafening. Tnere was no attomi.t at
d oration, but as the speakers and vice
) residents hied on to platform, a stalwart
individual advanced up the central aisle
bearing the national colors, which, amid
vociferous plaudits, were placed in the
middle of the stage.
Joseph Rothschild, chairman of the
evening, called forth another salvo of ap
plause as he led to the place of honor set
apart lor them the delegates from the
Woman Suffrage State Central Committee,
Miss Susan B. Anthony, Mrs. John X
Swift, Miss Harriet M. Mills, Mrs. Ma
Harper and Miss Mary E. Hay, chairman
of the committee. Despite the fact that it
was a meeting engineered by men, and
that mannish ways of speech were some
times heard, the ladies appeared to enjoy
the affair heartily.
The chairman, in calling the meeting to
order, said :
"I shall not attempt a speech, for my
business is merely to keep ordtr, which, I
think, will be an easy task. 1 merely call
to your recollection the fact that in the
high councils of our country there has
been a fight between the masses and tlie
classes. The masses have won, in the
nomination of Bryan of Nebraska as
Democratic candidate for the Presidency.
''I believe lhat, politically speaking, the
question of the day is sound money as dis
tinguished from free silver. I believe that
we are unanimously in favor of the free
coinage of silver at the rutio of 16 to 1.
The plank in the National platform in
favor of free coinage is directly in line
with the resolutions o! our county and
State organizations. As a result of this
plank in the National platform we have
now as a standard-bearer the Cicero of the
Northwest, William J. Bryan.
"We also have as his companion for the
campaign the worthy representative from
the far Northeast, Arthur Sewall of
Maine.
"But I did not intend to make a speech,
so I will stop without going further and
will prive place to the speakers of the even
ing."
D. M. Gavigan, the secretary of the
meeting, read the following list of vice

Coionel J. J. O'Byrne said he had hoped
to follow the other speaKers and not to
precede them. He said whenever a popu
lar protest against a great, common foe
was needed, a young man was usually
found to take the leadership. This was
the case in the nomination of Mr. Bryan.
â¢'A grand National protest," pursued
the colonel, "has been inaugurated against
the system whereby the b:ood and sweat
of American labor are converted into gold
for the dowries of the American brides of
foreign nobles. We should not be forced
to submit to the heavy golden yoke of
these men. I have a new name for them â
not 'gold bags,' or any other unmeaning
| term â but Mammonites, worshipers of
the false god Mammon."
The sentiment evoked a maudlin and
rather profane protest from a befuddled
individual in the gallery.
"Pot Wm out! Put him out!" cried the
crowd.
"Steady, steady," observed the gallant
colonel, ruildly. ""Have you anything to
say, sir?"
But the man was just vanishing through
the door under the escort of a pair of
police officers and held his peace.
"More than once," continued the speaker,
when order had been restored, ''it has
happened that free people have been
forced by unjust oppression at the hands
of money kings to rise in their might and
demand redress. A Spanish proverb says
the man who knows not, history is blind,
seeing nothing but what reaches his eyes.
Let us not be thus blinded, but rather look
at the present in the light of history's
torch.
"But I must give place to better speak
ers. I will only take enoaeh time to give
voice to a word of warning. Already the
sneaks and panthers of our enemy are go
ing about through the avenues and by
ways of our society, hinting that Mr.
Bryan is not sound on this or that public
question. I beg you to believe them not.
A searching investigation into his life and
record wil) show what he is â a man worthy
to represent the American people and lead
them lo a season of glorious National
prosperity."
The Colonel's eloquent address was in
terrupted by frequent bursts of applause.
At the conclusion of Colonel Byrne's
speech the chairman introduced the Hon.
R. B. Terry, who spoke as follows: "I
suppose that by the broad definition given
by our Presidential candidate, you
are all business men. I suppose on "the
other hand that to the narrow and re
stricted definition of our Republican
antagonists, none of you are business men
unless you are money-lenders.
"I maintain that in the Republican
convention at St. Louis the overwhelming
preference of the people for constitut onal
money was not expressed. In the conven
tion at Chicago just adjourned the senti
ments of you and of me and of four-tifihs
of the people were boldly and eloquently
proclaimed.
"The result of the Republican convention
at Â£t. Louis was known months before it
convened. The whole affair was manipu
lated by Mark Hanna. who is such a friend
of the workingman! The California silver
Republicans who went to the convention
pot the 'ha, ha!' and came home in
sorrow.
"At Chicago how differentl The men
in the convention were the heroes of the
Democratic party, who have been in ths
fore-front of every fight for a quarter of a
century.
"They had no candidate slated. Toward
the close of the convention tins young
champion of ours came forward and elo
quently refuted the specious arguments of
the opposition.
"ThiÂ«i man was by no means unknown.
He had already established a great repu
tation for himself as a champiou of right.
That man is the man who will now retire
to the seclusion of his home until he as
sumes the Presidential chair on the 4th of
nest March.
"There is no reason why any Democrats
should bolt from Mr. Bryan, unless it be
for the same reason that 'the Athenian of
old voted for the banishment of Aristides
â because he waÂ» tired of always hearing
him called 'the Just.' "
Mr. Terry closed his speech with a stir
ring encomium upon Susan B. Anthony
and the other laaies upon the platform
and appealed to the Democratic chivalry
of the audience to give her a respectful
hearing.
Mr. Rothschild then introduced Miss
Anthony, who was obliged to wait for
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 12, 1896.
fully three minutes before the cessation of
the applause which greeted her appear
ance.
"I am proud," she began, "to be present
here, and yet prouder at being asked to
speak. I came here to represent the 149
men in tbe Democratic convention who
voted in favor of the cause which I repre
sent. Gentlemen, have you not thought
it would be a pood thing for your vote to
be doubled ? [Great applause."]
"I recollect a story of a case that hap
pened in Wyoming. A strong Republican
lady had a Democratic husband. She had
rendered so many important services to
her party that wlien it came into power
she was offered various official positions.
The postoffice was at length proposed,
after she had refused a number of other
places which had been recommended.
'Well,' she said, 'I won't be bothered with
it; but you cau give it to my husband, if
he wants it. 1
The Balfian QuartÂ«t, composed of Messrs.
Flood, Orcutt, Hamberger and Duncan,
rendered "The Wolf Is On the Hill," by
Yon Weber, in their usual fine style, but the
two encores evoked the wildest enthu
siasm.
Walter Gallagher, the well-known attor
ney, also addressed the meeting.
The speaker reviewed tbe history of the
old Federalist party and told how It was
swept from the history of our country by
the Democracy of Jefferson.
"A New York Senator referred to the
New York Democracy as the Gibraltar of
the party. I join with Senator Hill In
saying that the New York delegation of
the Democratic convention was the Gibral
tar, the rock which has long enabled Eng
land to levy a tribute upon other nations.
"Never before since the days of Jack
son," continued Gallagher, "has the De
mocracy had such a leader as W. T. Bryan.
As in Jackson's administration, a delega
tion representing all the banks and rapital
came to the President and even threatened
him if he would not sign the charter for
the United States Bank monopoly; so
representatives hnve come to Cleveland,
but Cleveland, unlike Jackson. waÂ» false
to his principles. As Bryan said in his
great speech, we need another Jackson,
and by the help of the Almighty and the
people of this country we shall have
another Jackson in the Presidential chair
after the 4t1Â».0f next March."
Joseph G. Kelly, who was introduced as
an "aopirant for Congressional honors in
the Fifth Congressional District," eulo
gized in glowing terms the Democratic
standard-bearer.
The speaker then proceeded to draw in
a vivid manner the contrast between the
personnel of the Republican and Demo
cratic conventions. In conclusion, the
Congressional aspirant appealed to all to
support the "second Declaration of Inde
pendence â tbe Democratic platform of
1896" v
Robert Ferral, or "Bob" Ferral, as he is
generally known, was called to the plat
form by acclamation. In a speech replete
with characteristic sparks of native wit he
eulogized the Presidential nominee and
predicted for him a sweeping victory. He |
said the Chicago convention was the great
est, the squareÂ«t and the most honest body
of the kind ever brought together. There
were, he said, no palace-cars sidetracked
during that convention. It was simply
and truly the voice of the majority, which
Thomas Jefferson calls the essence of true
Democracy.
"They say William J. Bryan is a yonnr
man," he went on. "I hope no one will
advance that circumstance in his disfavor.
The man who hasn't sense enongh to run
this Government at the age of 3tiyears will
never get it. Mr. Bryan at least under
stands the 16 to 1 question."
"Please explain that,' 1 cried a voice in
the audience.
"It means sixteen Democrats to one Re
publican," retorted Bob, amid uproarious
applause.
Three cheers and a tiger were given for
'Bob Ferral," and then the band played
"He's a Jolly Good Fellow."
with a parting sling at the "fat man of
destiny" the Judge subsided.
Albert M. Armstrong, by the aid of a
unique and striking smile, explained the
meaning of the expression 16 to 1.
The meeting then closed with three
hearty cheers for Bryan and Sewall and
dispersed as the band played "The Red,
White and Blue."
THE STREET ELOQUENCE.
What the Speakers Said on Grant
Avenue.
At the O'Farrell-street stand, ex- Judge
Robert Ferral became tired of awaiting the
arrival of the regular chairman, P. J. Har
ney, and so concluded to open the speak
in*, without the formality of an introduc
tion. He accordingly climbed upon the
platform, took off his overcoat and hat
and began.
"Fellow citizens, we are here to ratify
the action of the late Chicago convention
in nominating the next President and
Vice-Presldent of the United States. We
haven t any money for brass bands and
torches, nor do we need any, for the
voters are with us, and the poor people are
with us.
*' The principles declaring for the free
and unlimited coinage of silver have been
adopted and emphasized by our National
Convention. It is true that the Repub
lican State Convention at Sacramento de
clared for the free coinage of silver, in
the ratio of 16 to 1, but the gold banner
was subsequently hoisted by the National
Republican Convention at St. Louis. Ever
since the Republicans of California have
been eating crow. They don't like it a bit,
but t liey continue to eat it.
"They were honest Democrats at Chi
caeo. There were no free railroad passes,
no cut and dried programme. Nobody
had spoken for the delegates. They cared
nothing for Grover Cleveland, United
States Senators pr daily newspapers, but
they did care for the American peonle and
for them they spoke. From the midst of
the gold corruptionists there emerged a
vounc giant of Democracy, William J.
Bryan, and he made the greatest speech
that has been heard for many years. It is
useless for me to ask you if you are in
favor of silver, for I know you are and
that you will outnumber the goldbugs 16
to 1.
"Let me then, in conclusion, nrjre upon
you the existing- necessity for your re
newal of your fidelity to the old Demo
cratic faith. I've nothing personal to say
against the Republican nominees for Pres
ident and Vice- President, but we are bat
tlinc for the poor and against the banker
and are determined to elect William J.
Bryan as the next President of the United
States."
"The people," said P. J. Harney, "con
cur in the great principles enunciated at
Chicago. The free and unlimited coinage
of silver, when put into operation, will
completely change the present depressed
condition of things and bring peace and
prosperity where there are now only pov
erty and distress.
"It was the Republicans who demone
tized silver and so caused all the trouble.
Our standard-bearer, W. J. Bryan, who so
eloquently advocates its restoration, is an
intellectual giant with an irreproachable
record. He is the champion of the people
and wiil lead us to glorious victory next
November."
"We cannot here attempt to discuss the
platform of the Chicago convention," said
Kugene N. Deuprey, "but lot us rejoice at
that grand young mental and physical
giant it has nominated as President "of the
United States, William J. Bryan.
"It means, my friends, that the people
will be heard, that the votes will be
counted, that plutocracy must stand and
that our nominees, Bryan and Sewall,
trill be elected next November." Mr.
Deuprey then called for three cheers,
which were' riven with a will, and then
stepped down.
Senator W. J. Biggy talked chiefly in
reference to the anti-funding plank of the
Chicago convention.
"C. P. Huntiueton and his in'amous as
sociates," he said, "have robbed i.he peo
ple and defrauded the Government. We
are now making a tight for freedom and
morality. Let us then do our duty by in
dorsing the Democratic platform and eject
ing its nomineeo, Brvan and Sewall
[ci.eersj President and Vice- President of
the United States."
â¢â¢Democracy," said W. P. Stradley, "ap
peals to the plain people of the United
States. Our party wnsfounded by Thomas
JefTerson, a son of the people, and to him
and to Jackson we have now renewed our
allegiance. Our doctrine means the use
of both geld and silver. Then our farmers
will no longer be impoverished, and the
people, and not the millionaires, shall in
future govern this country.
"What a contract is presented by the St.
Louis and Chicago conventions! At St.
Louis the Presidential nominee did not
dnre express his hone-t convictions. Very
different was the case with the Chicago
nominee, W. J. Bryan. Out of the West
nas come a new Lincoln, and Democracy
has loudly utterci her protest against tue
continuance of industrial slavery."
"I didn't coinp here to talk, but to have
a little fun." said Thomas J. Clunie. "I
indorse our nominees and our platform.
Ti e Democrats at Chicago knew what they
were aoout ana have made no mistake.
We ask no favors at the hands of the gold
bugs. You have the power to make the
wealthy men pay their just share of taxa
tion, and the best and quickest way to do
it is to elect Bryan and Sewall."
James Butier presided at the middle
stand, where addresses were made by W.
D. toady, Wm. Craig, P. M. Wellin, J. P.
Kelly. W. J. Locke. J. H. Barry, Clitus
Barbour, Charies Samner and C. A. Rey
nolds.
The speeches were as loyal and the en
thusiasm as great as at the two corner
btands.
P. J. Tomalty was master of ceremonies
at the third stand. The first speaker was
Hugo K. Asher. He said: "The first gun
has been fired in a campaign of convic
tions. Nominations have been made as
in olden timesâ from the hearts of the
people. The first thing is to look at the
staudard-bearers of the two parties and at
the parties themselves. The Republican
platform baa four pillars of gold, set on
shifting sand. On this platform stands a
man who is silent. He is silent perhaps
because he had nothing to do with the
bin hi ing of the platform on which he
stands.
"Now we have the Democratic platform
I built of four pillars of silver with gold to
ornament its foundations. On this plat
form we will go to victory next November.
But the man who represents this platform
is r.ot silentâ he helped to build it. William
J. Bryan comes before you on principles
and not promises."
Samuel JtJraunhartâ We are here to
ratify the nominations made at Chicago on
a silver platform. The infamous act of
1873 demonetizing silver, passed unnoticed
by many members of Congress and signed
by XJ. S. Grant, is about to be wiped out.
It will be wiped out by a Democratic Con
gress and signed by a Democratic Presi
dent in November next.
"I refer to William J. Bryan of Ne
braska. Not only will this infamous act
be swept away, but a new law favoring the
free and unlimited coinage of silver, inde
pendent of any nation on earth, will be en
acted. We will no longer submit to the
British dictating the policy for Ameri
cans."
Dr. Rottanziâ The battle has begunâ the
masses against the classes. We want no
eoldbugt in our party; we want gold Dem
ocrats and silver Democrats. There is an
old story to the effect that if you cut off
the tail of a dog he will fight better. We
have cnt off the tail of the Democratic
party in cutting off the goldbugs, and in
consequence victory has already perched
on on? banners.
Joseph Leggettâ The events in Chicago
during the last five days have demon
strated that government of the people, for
the people and by the people shall not
perish from the earth, ifever did men
more show by the course pursued that
they were de<:d in earnest than did that
body of men. Some weeks ajro the Repub
lican Convention met in St. Louis and
nominated a man â or rather Mark Hanna
did. Did anybody have any doubt as to
who would be selected?
Now turn to Chicago. Can any man
say who was to be the nominee of the con
vention? No. When that grand man, in
defense of his duty, replied to the on
slaughts of the gold people, he did so in
defense of a principle. The result was
spontaneous. I thank God to-night that
a man without money, for William J.
Bryan is not a plutocrat, had the oppor
tunity to become the nominee of the great
Democratic party.
Walter Stanleyâ George F. Hoar criti
cized the Democratic party because it was
so full of common people. It is a party of
the people and the platform adopted at
Chicago renews its allegiance to the
people.
Met to Ratify.
The "Merchants' Political Reform Club"
held a special meeting at 410 Kearny street
last evening for the purpose of ratifying
the nominations of the Chicago Demo
cratic convention. J. G. Conroy, the pres
ident, occupied the chair and briefly stated
the object of the meeting. Secretary M.
F. Donleavy formulated a resolution* in
dorsing the nominations and also the plat
form, with an "accent"' on the silver
plar.k. Before its adoption Judge Robert
Ferral spoke enthusiastically to the ques
tion. He was followed by A. G. Cooper,
James Dennis, W. P. Crowley and Secre
tary Donleavy, after which the meeting
adjourned to Metropolitan Hall.
WHITE HAKE IK THS BAY.
At Tiburon They Are Herded Like Cat-
tie on the Beach.
There has been the largest school of
white hake ever seen in the bay before
in years, just off the shore of Tiburon.
"In the morning," said Captain White
of the ferry steamer Tiburon, "'the water
near to the shore is white with fish. There
must be millions of them. Men wade out
into the shallow water and throw the fish
onto the beach simply with their hands.
They 'herd' them as though they were
cattle. Our watchmen went out this
mornin g and came back inside of a half
hour with a string of twenty of them.
They are lane fish, nearly two feet long,
and make a very pood table food. This Is
the first time in many years that I have
seen such large numbers in the bay since
I nave been on this coast"
JOHN BUCKINGHAM DEAD,
Prominent Democrat of Mendo
cino and Editor of a Ukiah
Paper.
Succumbed at St Luke's Hospital
Yesterday After a Severe
Operation.
John P. Buckingham, editor and pro
prietor of the Diepatch-Demoorat of
Ukiah. Depnty Revenue Collector for the
Fourth District, and a prominent Demo
cratic leader of Mendocino County, died
yesterday morning about 8 o'clock at St.
Luke's Hospital, after a -cvora operation
similar to that for appendicitis.
He went to the hospital last Thursday
and was operated upon the same day.
Although he was somewhat restrained by
a delicate constitution he was a tireless,
energetic work, r and his unexpected
death will come as a shock to those who
only a few days ago saw him in appar
ently his customary health and jovial
spirits.
He was of a generous, whole-souled,
boyish nature, and his cordial handgrasp
and peculiarly winning smile will long oe
remembered by those who knew him
either as a favorite citizen at Ukiah or as
an ardent Democrat, for he was chairman
of the Democratic committee of the
Fourth District for three years, and was
one of the committee from Mendocino
County at the recent Democratic conven
tion in Sacramento. All his life he was an
industrious reader, and he was a strong
defender of his Democratic principles.
Mr. Buckingham waa a native of Exeter,
Canada, and 3.9 years of age. For the last
fifteen years he made California his home.
He married a daughter of Mart Baechtel,
one of the best-knoWn residents of Little
Lake, Mendocino County. His widow sur
vives him. Harry Baecbtel of the firm of
Wilson & Baechtel of this City is his
brother-in-law.
Some years previous to his connection
with the Ukiah weekly Mr. Buckingham
was associated with William Heeser in
Mendocino City in the publishing of the
Mendocino Beacon.
The funeral will be held Monday after
noon at 2 o'clock and the interment will
take place at Cypress Lawn Cemetery.
SAN FRANCISCANS WIN.

The fourth game of the series now being
played at the California League baseball
grounds, Sixteenth and Folsom streets,
took place yesterday between the San Jose
and San Francisco clubs, the latter com
ing off victors by a score of 21 to 13.
The work of Krug of the San Franciecos
and Zann of the San Joses were the fea
tures of yesterday's game. When Krug
made a home run by knocking a fly clear
across the field and into the carriage drive
way the applause was tremendous.

II IS ARMED NEUTRALITY
Condition of Affairs Between the
Southern Pacific and the
0. R. and N. Co.
Advances in Rates Just Decidel Upon
Said to Be of a Tentative
Nature.
Armed neutrality and not peace exists
between the Southern Pacific Company
and the Oregon Railway and Navigation |
Company. The present advances in pas
senger rates are only tentative. Should
results not prove satisfactory to either
party the war may be renewed.
H. R. Judah returned from Portland
yesterday and In the course of an inter
view stated that by agreement with the
Oregon Railway and Navigation Company
the rates on the special train which leaves
every five days on the same date as the
steamers of the opposition tbe first-class j
rate between here and Portland would be j
$19 and the second-class rate $10. This is j
a difference of $7 and $4 respectively be- j
tween the new railroad rates and the re- I
vised steamship rates announced in The j
Call yesterday.
The advanced rail rate, however, does
not include a berth with a tirst-class ticket, !
while the old rates of $10 and $5 included
a berth with either first or second class |
passage.
When the war was at its height in its
early period Traffic Manager Stubbs de
clared that it was brought on by, vain
peaceable efforts to adjust the proportion !
of business between the two transportion
companies. He claimed that the Southern
Pacific Company, by virtue of its daily
trains and faster service, was justly en
titled to two-thirds of the through pa'ssen
per traffic, but the Oregon Railroad and
Navigation people held that their lower
rates, which included berths and meals,
should bring them one-half of this busi
ness.
When the conference at Portland, at
which General Manager ilcNeill of the
Oregon Railway and Navigation Company
and Traffic Manager Stubbs of the South
ern Pacific Company were the principal
figures, began Mr. McNeill suggested $12
and $6 us the rates his company proposed
to put into effect, aud asked what rates
the railroad company would put in to
meet them. Mr. Stubbs thought that the
experience of the past ten months justified
a differential of $7 and $4 respectively on
first-class and second-class rates; that is,
that the rail rates should be $19 for first- j
class and $10 for second-class.
These rates are simply experimental,
and should the results prove unsatisfac
tory to either side hostilities may be re
newed. But no change in the situation
is likely, however, to take place within a
month.
Edwin Goodali, representing the Pacific
Coast Steamship Company, was also pres
ent at the conference. His company was
forced to cut its regular rates from $15 and
$7 50 for first and second-class fares, re
spectively, to Puget Sound ports to $8 and
$5. Taese are now to be restored to the old
rates.
The advanced rail rates go into effect
from Portland on the 21st inst., and from
here on the 22d. These are tbe same dates
on which the steamship company will
make its rates effective.
It was found Impossible to do anything
toward advancing freight rates, owing to
the water competition that has sprung ud
by numerous individual steamers plying
between Portland and San Francisco.

CREEK FULL OF WEALTH
Enough Gold Hidden There, He
Says, to Make Twenty
Men Rich.
MINING FEVER IS SPREADING.
Tbree Canvas-Trppcd Wrgons Yesler
day Took Passage for Hurri
cane Gnch.
There is a mine set beneath the quiet
exterior of pretty Bausal.to, a mine of
bona fiae gold. It is soon to be tired, and
unless the enthusiasm of Sergeant Jack
"House of th^ Bay- Window" Residence of Sergeant Jack Hayes, Who Has Discovered Gold in the
Gulch Just to the Left of the Tank.
Hayes of the Harbor Police goes for !
naught never again will that little
Englishy town be accused of passiveness
ami of drowsiness beyond 'lie awakening
ot the most energetic mind.
Serceant Hayes, as has already been re
lated, found sold in the bed of the creek
running at the rear of his residence in
Hurricane Gulch. He not only saw gold
and obtained by skillful cradling a nugget
or two, put he saw what is still better â in
dications that a vast amount of the pre
cious metal lies hidden under the gravel
of the creek.
Sergeant Hayes does not intend to let
tnis discovery remain undeveloped. He
already has mapped out a scheme to form
a mining company, the members of which
own property along the banks of the
stream.
"I uo not want to be a hog, and
I am willing to give my neighbors a
chance. v said he emphatically yesterday,
the tire of positive assurance and enthusi
asm shining in iiih eves. "I am con
vinced ihat enough gold lies in that creek
to make every resident in Hurricane
Gulc!; comfortable for the remainder of
tneir days.
"There are about twenty people living
along the creek, and I propose to otart a
company to develop the wealth of this
mine 1 have found. The creek from where
it leaves the wall of the hill to the bay is
about 1000 yards in length. I was told to
day by an old resident of Sausalito that j
some twelve years ago a great deal of gold I
was taken from the hill just above, but for |
some reason or other the enterprise fell
through and the thing was abandoned.
"I know that I am the first man who i
has proepected on this creek. I believe
that for hii'.K'redsof years the water which ',
flows with terriric force off the hill in the i
rainy seasons has washed quartz into this :
creek until it ha? been filled to its present i
level. I have mined a great deal around ;
this State, and t know someth ing of where j
gold may be expected to be found. I am j
firmly convinced that cold lies here in i
almost Inexhaustible quantities.
"Tnis is not a quartz mine where expen
sive machinery is required, but a placer '
mine of the most approved pattern. Only J
a few picks and shovels and cradles are :
necessary to get the yellow metal.
"If lean form a company of my neighbors,
each man putting up so much, and whe'il
the mine has been thoroughly worked each
man taking nis dividend, minun the ex
pense, which I do not believe will aggre
gate more than $2500, I tell you, sir, each
man of that twenty will not be obliged j
to work any more far a living.
"I mean business, and I snail endeavor
to prove this to my neighbors. Ido not
think that I shall encouiaer any difficulty
in starting this tbinir.
"Miller, now since the story of the gold
find has been published, is not inclined to
sell me the triangular-shaped lotintde
gulch adjoining mine. But I shall see
Mr. Miller to-night and make a fair propo
sition to him. 1 was the first to discover
gold on Ihe property, therefore I believe
1 have a miner's lien on it In Leadviile
a man discovered gold in the middle of
the street, in the best loca'ion in the city,
yet none of the landholders in the vicinity
were able to get the land away from him,
and the mine is being worked to this day.
"Sunday I will fuily investigate whether
my belief is well founded or not, and after
that I shall be better preparei to formu
late plans for a stock company. No, as I
said oefore, I have no desire whatever to
take everything. 1 want my neighbors to
enjoy v little, too."
Sergeant Hayes lives in one of the most
charm ine retreats in Sausalito. The house
he lives in is famous thereabouts for being
'The nouse of tlie bay-windows." It was
originally owned by a man named Gri:*
wold, a carpenter, who, being somewhat
reduced in circumstances, yet pOMesftog
withal an esthetic eye, first erected on his
plat of ground a high two-story bay-win
dow house.
This, of course, aroused the curiosity of
his neighbors, and when foreign ships
came into the harbor some one versed in
the lore of th'? villa would point out t is
singular, tower-like structure, saying, j
"There is the house of the bay-windows." â 
As time went dv Griswold added little ]
by little to this houseless ornament until
finally the cosy residence now- owned by
tue sergeant, but still retaining its early
rarue, nestled itself amid the verdure of
Sausalito':Â» hills.
The gold fever first taken by Sergeant
Hayes in his own home has spread wiih
wonderful rapidity. Yesterday morning,
on an early boat to Sausalito, three men
on horseback, having at their saddles
picks, pans ond blankets, took passage, 1
according to Sergeant Mahoney, for Hur
ricane Gulch to stake out claims there, and
later in the afternoon three of the regula
tion canvas-topped wacons that years ago
trareroed the plains drawn toward that
loadstone, Piks's Peak, were carried across
on the Sausalito, destined for the newly
discovered gold nelds in the gulch.

MRS, CRAVEN CONSENTS,
She Allows the Fair Executors
to Collect Disputed Prop
erty Rents.
Stipulation Signed by the Various
Attorneys Engaged in the
Noted Case.
The attorneys for Nettie R. Craven yes
terday agreed to allow the special admin
istrators of the Fair estate to continue col
lecting the rents from the tenants of the
Pine and Sansome streets and other prop
erty of the late James G. Fair for which
Mrs. Craven filed the pencil deeds some
time ago.
Late Friday evening an application for
a receiver for the property, pending the
decision of the suit to quiet title, was filed.
The matter came up before Judge 81ack
yesterday. The various attorneys, after a
consultation, agreed on the following
stipulation :
It is hereby stipulated by and between the
undersigned, Piprson <fc Mitchell ana <;. \V.
McEnorney, attorneys tor the plaintiffs! named,
and Delimit it- SMortridge, as attorneys for de
fendants, Netti<- It. Craven find Marc Leving
ston. that during the pendency of this action
Hn'l until judgment shall have b?en revemd
in said Superior Const, the plaintiffs may and
shall, hÂ» special administrators of. the estate of
James G. Fair, deceased, continue to collect
the rent of the property in controversy in this
notion, provided that if said defendants, or
either oi them, shall obtain judgment against
said plaintiffs in said action, said plaintiffs
shall account to said defendants or defendant
in their oflicial capacity as such special admin
istrators for the ;-ents thus collected siuce the
commencement of this action, and provided
further that the right of eaid plaintiffs to make
slid collections is vested in laid plaintiff? In
their official capacity only and shall expire
whenever Their official capacity as such special
administrators shall cease.
According to this agreement the special
administrators will collect ?nd hold the
disputed rents subject to the decision of
the court until the case is decided. This
course was necessary because thf> tenants
refused to pay any rent at all until it was
settled who could legally collect it.
After the signing of the stipulation At
torney Delmas announced that he would
have the ejectment suits against the ien-'
ants and heirs dismissed. The arrange
ment will also do away with the suiti of
the tenants asking that they may pay the
rent to the court.
Notary J. J. Cooney, wno was ordered
to appear and sign his deposition acknowl
edging the pencil deads at 10 o'clock yes
terday morning, failed to appear and an
attachment was issued. The deputy failed
to serve it, and up to the time tie court ad
journed Mr. Cooney had not been found.
It was arranged that should the paper be
served during the evening Cooney would
go to Judge Slack's house and sign the
deposition.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 12, 1896.
CONVICTS' FARE
UNFIT TO EAT.
They Complain of Bad Food
at San Quentin
Prison.
THE PORK WAS RANCID.
Now They Will Have Fruit
Regularly acd Sound
Diet Daily.
DIRECTORS WERE SURPRISED.
Financial Statement at the Close of
the Prison's Forty-Sev
enth Year.
The State Prison Commissioners, in ses
sion at San Quentin Prison yesterday,
heard a complaint from the convicts about
the food served and the method of cook
mg. About ten prisoners representing a
dissatisfied elemei:t appeared in the board
room with a formal protest, and the result
; is there will be a change for the better in
| the food supply of Sin Quentin Prison.
' Fruits and mush will be served regularly
> as a medicinal measure and a strict watch
I will be kept on the kitchen.
The complaint was in substance that the
I potatoes were sosrgy and waterlogged, the
, bread usually several days old, bfans un
i ! palatable, poorly cooiced and served
I twenty times a week; pork rancid and
I never supplied in sufficient quantities; tea
! so bad that nine out of every teu tins
j were untouched ; steaks provided every
' morning were cut thin, fried hard and
served cold. A request was made for a
change and closer inspection of the culi
nary department generally.
When the complaint was read Director
Neff asked:
"How often do you get fruit?'
"Don't get itat all," exclaimed the group
of prisoners in unison.
"At no time?"
"No, sir, except raisins in the pudding
twice a week."
"You complain about beans?" remarked
Neff.
"They would rattle in the pan they are
\ so hard."
One of the prisoners stepped out in front
| and offered a full explanation of bow he
! and his companions happened to be before
I the board. "Captain Edgar," said he,
! "forced us ud here. We didn't want to
' come before the board. Captain Edgar
j came to me and said, 'I understand there
I is going to be a riot in the jute mill; you
boys intend to strike over the food.' I told
him 1 knew nothing about it. 'Well,' he
replied, 'you and any of the dissatis
fied boys tase your complaint to the board
! and see the warden about it. The papers
will got hold of it and then there will be
an investigation.'
"My statement is, gentlemen, I don't
want to carry the onus, but if cther3 do
there are many of us who must protect
ourselves."
Director Neff remarked that what the
convicts stated about the kitchen was true,
i but the board could make no change, at
| least for some time to come, owing to the
) lack of funds,
â¢â¢How about the pork In tne beans?" he
asked.
"There is no meat in the beans," replied
a convict.
"The meat is always boiled," added an
i other prisoner. "They have good ovens
and might roast it sometime*. But It Is
boiled often a day ahead and not fit to eat.
! Itsmelleand makes us sick. The coiivicts
i are for peace; they're afraid to kick, as
; there would be an aftermath."
Warden Hale assured the convicts there
would be no "aftermath," but he was glad
to bear them speak. They knew his senti
ments, and the board would treat them
humanely. He stated that the bread
served the prisoners was fresh every day,
I but one of the convicts insisted it was fre
quently seven days old. Captain Sbappe
lere, the steward, admitted that the bread
was often thirty-six hours; o'd when
served. A prisoner in the bakery stated it
was commonly four days old. The ques
tion of rescinding a rule prohibiting fruit
to be presented to convicts was discussed,
but the board would make no change, as
opium had been smuggled into the prison
in fruit
A convict with a delicate' stomach pro
tested that the prison doctor had said
there was no hope of curing prisoners with
stomach troubles unless tiie regimen of
diet was changed. He aiso said that large
quantities of food were wasted. The pork
in particular was bad.
Captain Shappele re was called by a direc
tor and asked if this were true.
"We have had a good deal of bad pork
sir," was his answer.
"It should not have occurred a second
time," said Director Hayes rather angrily.
"Bad pork should bo sent back every
time."
"I am going to coma here twice a week
soon," remarked Chairman Wilkena, "and
, I shall look into this matter, and if I find
any bad food or poor cooking I won't per
mit it."
Director de Pue added: "If the prison
ers wish fruit the State should furnish it.
It is cheap and nould be beneficial io the
health ot the prisoners."
The board did not vote on the com
plaint, but decided that a change should
be made.
Warden Hale reported that 2.300,000
jule bags had been sold, and 2,918,000. now
on hand, would be disposed of within the
next six weeks. Orders were romine in
daily for large quantities at $4 20 a hun
dred bags.
The t.-a.ert accountant of the board sub
mitteo his report on the accounts of San
Quentin tor the quarter ending June 30,
which c osed the forty-seventh tiscal year
of the prison. He had found all accounts
and vouchers absolutely correct, and was
complimentary in his comments on them.
The ca.sh account was: Cash in vault, j
$0808 77: in California state Bank at Sac- |
ramento, $24,930 78; total on hand, $30,- I

NEW TOLAND WILL CONTEST.
Amended Opposition to the Probate of
an Important Document.
A new opposition to the probate of the
will of Mary B. Toland has been filed on
behalf of William Gridley Toland, grand
son of the deceased, by his attorneys, Del
mas & Shortridge.
The opposition recites that the petitioner
is informed and beiieves that the docu
ment offered for probate was not sub
scribed by Mary B. Toland, or by any other
person in the presence or by the direction
of Mary B. Toland; that the alleged sub
scription of the deceased was not made In
the presence of George K. Hooper or any
one else, and was not acKnowledged by bftr
to the aliened sub-xribing wituers thereto:
that at the time of the alleged subscribing
of the document Mary B. Totand aid not
declare it to be her will, And that it was
Has Been the Practice of Medicine
and Surgery in San Francisco
by Dr. Sweany.
THE STORY OF HIS SUCCESS.
The Great Specialist Has Made Life Anew to Thousands and Tens
of Thousands who Had Been Given Up by Other Physi
cians â Mis Specialties and Mode of Treatment.
By his skill and as a specialist Dr.
Bweany ban completely revolutionized the
practice of medicine and surgery in San
Francisco.
Standing to-day, as he does, far in ad
vance of any specialist or medical institu
tion in the country, his wonderful success
and skill are the outerrowth of several con
ditions by which alone what he has done
iiNian /rancisco could be accomplished.
First, the qualifications with which na
ture has endowed him, as evidenced by
his keen perception into the mysteries of
all diseases with which those who apply
to him are afflicted. He is thus enabled
to clearly distinguish the exact character
of the complaint and to conceive the
proper and most effective kind of treat
ment for its entire cure.
Second, he is wholly devoted to his pro
fession, having no other desire for achieve
ment than to make still grander the com
plete success which be has thus far at
tained. His great stability of character,
his unceasing study and untiring energy
to accomplish that which be sets out to
do, together with many more great and
noble qualities, which one soon recognizes
in him, all serve to advance him in his
most worthy ambition.
Third, his great advantages of study and
experience in the leading and best col
leges and hospitals In the land, where he
served in nil departments, and where his
great natural ability was acknowledged in
all branches as being superior to his quite
worthy but less successful associates, have
all helped to assist him in his work.
la it any wonder that, with all these ad
rantage* in his favor, natural ability,
stndv. experience and a mind devoted to
his profession Dr. Sweany should have
achieved his enviable reputation for curing
distressing and obstinate cases which have
been given up as incurable?
not and is not her last will, and was not
wholly or at all written or dated or signed
by the ha 'd of Mary B. Toland; that long
before and at. the time of the alleged sign
ing of the document offered for probate
Mary B. Tola d was not of : sound or dis
posing mint*, but was insane and wholly
incompetent- to make any will or t3sta
ment.\'^Sg ' >"."
Therefore a trial by jury of the issues of
facts so raised is demanded, and it is
prayed that the will offered for probate be
denied probate and declared not the last
will and testament of Mary B. Toland.
If the contest .be â¢ successiul William
Gridley Toland will be entitled to a half
of bis grandmother's estate, the other Half
going to Hugo H. Toland.

i As yet no case of failure can be discov-
e red against him, and such ability and
, skill to combat and conquer all diseases of
I men and women have never before been
, demonstrated.
The Doctor's services are of great value,
and if any one thine be worth more than
anything else It is certainly the services ol
a competent and successful physician and
specialist who never loses sieht of a single
: case until a perfect and permanent cure is
effected. Those who are afflicted should
not waste time, money and health dosing
with cheap treatments, cheap m dicines
and nostrums.
The Doctor gives his services free of
' charge to the poor and worthy who call
at his office every Friday afternoon, and
many expressions of gratitude and praise
go out daily from the poor as well as from
those who have^aid him well for valuable
i and successful services rendered. As a
man Dr. Sweany is truly upright, consci
entious and charitable, and as a physician
he is thoroughly competent, earnest and
successful, and any and all persons who
may be suffering from any human ailment
whatever will do themselves a great injus
tice if they do not call upon him, even if
their troubles have resisted all other ef
forts to cure. He treats nervous debility
of every kind, name and nature far in
advance of any other institution in this
country.
He also treats private and chronic dis
eases; blood and skin diseases; female
complaints; kidney, bladder, liver, lung,
throat, stomach and heart diseases: piles,
rupture, hydrocele, varicocele and kindred
troubles without pain or detention from
| business. He addresses himself in par*
j ticular to young and middle-aged men
i who are Buffering from the awful effects of
I early indiscretions, and are thereby un-
I fitted for Rtudy, business or the proper
I enjoyment of either marrird or single life*
In this distressed condition are many
thousands who, although originally strong
in body and bright, in uiind, have permit
ted their ailment to run on and on, until
finally, with physical and mental powers
exhausted, death claimed them. The most
obstinate cases of this character the doctor
treats with unfailing success. All he wants
is a fair trial to convince the most skepti
cal. He uses no mercury or other Injuri
ous drugs, and undertakes no incurable
cases. The great specialist can be con
sulted ot his office any day from 9 to 12

LONE SENTINEL
OF THE DEAD,
Rears Its Graceful Lines
in an Abandoned
Cemetery.
BAR TO IMPROVEMENT.
Prevents the Sale of a Valuable
Block of Land in the
Mission.
SUBJECT OF MUCH COMMENT.
Brief History of the Monument and
the People Who Lie Buried
B neath It.
Solitary, tall, white and conspicuous,
surrounded on all sides by gaping graves,
which had but recently given up their
dead, stands the monument erected to the
The Lone Sentinel of the Dead in the Abandoned Cemetery of the Congregation
Emanu-EI.
[Sketched by a "Call" artist.]
memory of Mrs. Augusta R. Neustadt and
her first and second husbands, James
Michael and Isaac S. JosephL Almost
exactly in tne center of the abandoned
cemetery of the Congregation Emanu-El
it rears its graceful shaft. So. striking and
dominating is its appearance that it has
become a general and interesting topic of
discussion in the Mission.
The cemete ry is bounded by Eighteenth,
Nineteenth. Doloree and Church streets.
It immediately adjoins on the north that
of the Congregation Sherith Israel, and
there is now nnder consideration a propo
sition of both being purchased by the City
ana converted from resting places for the
dead into breathing places for the quick.
But so long as this lone sentinel retains its
post, no transfer of the property can be
consummated. It is this phase of the
situation that has excited the greatest
comment and curiosity.
Why does the Congregation Emanu-El
permit this tomb to remain? and why
have the bodies not been removed by the
interested relatives of the deceased ? are
the questions asked.
The tombstone is enclosed by an iron
railing, once handsome but now rust
eaten and worn, it stands above the
beads of the dead, while thiee footstones,
thrown prostrate by some desecrating
band, are inscribed with the initials of the
person over whose resting-place they lie.
On the center one are the letters "J. M."
That on the right bears the characters "A.
R. N.," while the one on the left displays
"I. 8. J." On the front of the handsomely
chiseled base of the tombstone "is the in
scription: "In memory of James Michael;
died September 15, 1865, aged 49 year?."
The dedication to Isaac S. Josephi is on
the face to the left of this. He died June
26,1870, aged 39 years and 11 months. The
inscription on the right side of the monu
ment informs the carious that the widow
of these two men and subsequently the
wife of another died at the early and un
timely age of 34, on the 19th of August,
1875.
M. F. Michael, a son of Mrs. Neustadt
by her first husband, is an attorney and
resides in this City. Mr. Neustadt, who
was the third husband of Mrs. Michael, is
now in the East, and it is said that by the
members of the Congregation Emanu-El
that the responsibility for the non-removal
of bodies rests upon the son, whose atten
tion lias been repeatedly called to the mat
ter, but without result.
According to the statement of one of the
officials of the synagogue, the presence of
these remains, and of one or two others,
stands seriously in the way of the sale of
the block of valuable land formerly used
as the cemetery of the congregation. He
remarked that this circumstance was the
more regrettable, because half the proceeds
of the sale will go to the Eureka Benevo
lent Society to be applied to the relief of
the destitute.
LOOKING FOR COONEY.
The Ex-Notary in the Craven-Fair Case
Forgot Hi* Date With the
Conrt.
J. J. Cooney, the ex-notary public whose
deposition was taken before Judge Slack
on Thursday last, did not appear yester
day according to the Judge's order to sign
the deposition. A bench warrant was is
sued and a Deputy Sheriff started to look
him up and bring him into court. He
could not be found, however.
Judge Cooney, his father, fays the young
man was in the office on Friday. It is bis
custom, he says, to go out of town on Fri
day night and to return on Monday. He
Bays he does not think his son understood
the order calling him to court.
Mr. Delmas stated to the court that he
wa- confident the witness did not under
stand the situation. He has been expect-
ing to go out of town and that was one
reason why they were anxious to have his
deposition taken. He had gone on the
stand, been sworn, given his testimony
and been cross-examined and he probably
supposed that that was all tnat was re
quired of him and so had gone to camp or
elsewhere, as he intended. Upon his re
turn to town the witness would come for
ward and sign the deposition.
POSTOFFICE RECEIPTS.
Increase of $41,858 Over the Preced
ing Tear and 834,300 Over 1894.
For the fiscal year ending June 30, the
receipts of the Postoffice, exclusive of
money order and foreign business, shows
an increase over the ; preceding year of
$41,858, arid for 1894 of $34,300.
Since 1890 the average yearly receipts
show a steady average increase, though
there was a slight falling off after 1893.
The present year, however, more than
overbalanced the losses of the two preced
ing years. Below will be found the re
ceipts . for the fiscal and calendar years
since 1890:

"The poor showing of 1894 is due to the
strike," said Secretary Richardson yester
day. "Since that time the receipts have
gradually increased, all of which I think
is a very clear indication oi the general
prosperity of the country. The calendar
year will show the largest receipts of any
year since 1890."

TO TEST THE ORDINANCE
S. A. Born, Contractor and Builder,
Arrested on Golden Gate
Avenue.
He Was Driving in a Light Cart,
Which He Claims Is Not a
Heavy Vehic'e.
8. A. Born, contractor and builder, 4079
Twenty-fourth street, will test the consti
tutionality of the Golden Gate avenue
boulevard ordinance.
He is erecting a residence for himself on
Golden Gate avenue, near Baker street,
and is also erecting a building on Point
Lobos avenue.
Yesterday afternoon about 4 o'clock he
was driving along Golden Gate avenue in
his light two-wneeled cart to pay his men.
His 9-year old son was sitting beside
him and he had a few strips of wood abont
twelve feet long tied on the cart, which he
was taking to the Golden Gate-avenue
house.
Just before he reached Scott street he
was arrested by Policeman T. J. Dugan
for violating the boulevard ordinance and
was driven in the patrol wagon to the City
Prison, where he gave bail and was re
leased.
Mr. Born was indignant over his arrest,
which he characterized as an outrage.
"My light cart is not a heavy vehicle,"
he said, "and is not covered by the ordi
nance. It is more a buggy than anything
else, and is used by me for driving round
town to my different jobs and taking my
wife out for a drive occasionally.
"When the policeman accosted me he
asked me where the I was going. I
told him, and he asked if I did not know
t: at it was against tiie ordinance to drive on
the avenue, I told him mine was a buggy,
but he said, 'You drive right back and get
off this street.' I said I would drive down
Bcott street, but he insisted upon my driv
ing back.
"An I turned the horse around I said if
I bad the time I would allow him to
arrest me and test the matter in the courts.
With that he grabbed my horse by the
head aud placed me under arrest. He
wanted my son to driv.- the bnggy home,
but I hired a man to drive with the rig to
my men and notify them I would pay
them later. I toid the policeman that I
was a taxpayer and owned property in the
City, but nc said he did not believe me,
and abused me.
"I will fight this matter to the bitter
end nnd will see if a taxpayer and
reputable citizen cannot drive his buggy
along Golden Gate avenne without being
subjected to arrest and abuse.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 12, 1896.
CfIEEGftN AND
BECKER GUILTY.
Conviction of the Crocker-
Woolworth Bank
Swindlers.
VERDICT OF THE JURY.
Judge Wallace Sums up the Evi
dence in Favor of the
Accused.
SURPRISE AT THE FINDING.
The First Ballot Stood Seven for Con.
viction and Five for
Acquittal.
James Creegan and Charles Becker, the
malefactors, by whose operations the
Crocker- Woolworth Bank was robbed of
$20,000, were yesterday convicted of forg
ery in Judge Wallace's court. The case
has been on trial for more than a week
ana yesterday was given to the jury.
When court opened Judge VVallace be
gan his charge to the twelve good men
and true. It was a rather long and tech
nical address and forty minutes were oc
cupied in Its delivery. Creegan, whose
nerve has never once deserted him during
the progress of the case, remained im
passive to the end, bat Becker was mani
festly nervous. He fidgeted about in his
chair and pulled spitefully at different
portions of his clothing. Every few min
utes a lump would seemingly rise in his
throat and he made continuous efforts to
swallow it.
The attorneys and courtroom attaches
agree that the charge to the jury was a
masterful one, fair and unbiased.
After reciting the law in the case, his
Honor said in part:
Inasmuch as there is no testimony before
the jury tending to show that the draft men
tioned in the indictment was forced in the
City and County of San Francisco, uiu are in
structed that the only quesiion for you to try
is whether the accusation made against the
defendants of having passed the draft with in
tent to defraud is true. Ttie filing of au in
dictment against the defendants ciirries with
it no presumption of guilt and upon their plea
of not guilty the presumption of their inno
cence is in their lavor. Unless that presump
tion is overcome and removed by suftic.c-nt
countervailing proof of guilt, the defendants
are entitled to an acquittal.
The defendants hare not testified in their
own behalf, but you are not to consider that
circumstance us a fact in this case for any pur
pose. They could testity or not, as they saw
fit, a matter which must be utterly ignored by
you in considering this case.
All persons concerned in the commission of
this alleged passing of the forged draft are
principals in the alleged crime, and the testi
mony of such person is but tne testimony of an
accomplice, and no conviction can be had on
the testimony of an accomplice unless such
testimony be corroborated by omer evidence
which in Itself tends to connect the <iefend
antd with the commission of the offense, and
the corroboration is not sufficient ii it merely
shows the commission oi the offense or the
circumstances thereof.
The testimony of an accomplice ought to be
viewed by you with, distrust. It in asserted by
the prosecution that the passing aim utteriutf
of the draft was committed by Creegan end
Becker, in confederation with one Dean; thai
the draft was forged by one 01 thuin in the
county ol Alameda and passed upon the Ne
vada Bank by another of them. If such bo the
fact all three are guilty, and the declarations
and acts of one in the promotion of their com
mon purpose are to be taken as the declara
tions and act* of each and ail of them and are
to be considered by you as evidence against
both Creegan and Becker. It is only if you be
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt thati
there was such a confederation between^
the three that you ran consider the
alleged conversations between Dean and
Creegan in the absence of Becker as evidence
against the latter; of course, if you are satis
fied that Creegan held such conversations
with Dean, they must be considered as evi
dence ajrainst Creegan. but if you believe that
Becker was not a parly to the conspiracy then
Creegan could not incriminate him by saying
to Dean that he, Becker, was such party.
A witness false in one part of his testimony
is to be distrusted in others. Evidence of oral
admissions of a party must be viewed with
caution. A witness may be impeached by evi
dence that he has been convicted of a te'lony.
Even though you may believe the testimony
of one who is an accomplice, the law forbids
you to convict upon such testimony unless it
be corroborated by independent evidence
tending to connect the defendants with the
commission of the crime.
It is claimed that Dean alone passed the
draft upon the bank and not that Creegan
or Becker wrre pre-ent, but you arc instructed
that even though Dean alone passed it, still
If he was acting in concert and confederation
with Creegan and Becker, they are jointly en
gage.-! with him in the criminal enterprise. 80
doing all have been equally and alike guilty
of the crime.
The jury retired at 10:45, and it was soon
reported that the first ballot stood seven
for conviction and five for acquittal. The
accused passed the time talking with
their attornovs and listening to the ar
raignments of a crowd of offenders, who
were broueht before the court to plead.
At 12:20 the jury returned and the fore
man announced that a verdict had been
agreed upon.
Becker turned pale and then the blood
mounted to his face, and he blushed as
rosily as a maid of 16. Crcegan moved
squarely about and faced the jury.
"What is your verdict, gentlemen?" in
quired Judge Wallace.
"We, the jury, find the defendants
guilty of forgery'in uttering and passing
the draft as charged in the indictment,
and so say we all," replied Foreman
Joseph J. Twohig.
The verdict was a surprise to nearly
every one present, as the belief prevailed
that tne defendants would either be ac
quitted or that the jury would disagree.
Creegan never moved a muscle while the
verdict was being read, but Becker was
greatly agitated. He almost collapsed,
and as he walked out of the courtroom
was very unsteady.
The verdict, in view of Judge Wallace's
charge, has a peculiar phase. While the
defendants were convicted of having
passed the forged draft in San Francisco,
the forgery took place in Alameda County,
and hence Creegan and Becker are liable
to conviction there on a charge of forgery.
They will be sentenced on Monday.
OBJECTS TO PAYING.
F. W. Rrellng Dislikes . the Notion of
Having to Part With Five â '..' .
Thousand Dollars.
On or soon after August 3 the Supreme
Court will hear a petition filed yesterday
by F. W. Kreling, asking for a writ of
supersedeas in the action of Ernestine
Kreling against the petitioner. The j.eti
tiun recites that on tne 24th of September,
18!>4, an action against the petitioner was
commenced by Mrs. Kreling in order to
compel him to pay over to the Anglo-
Californian Bank the sum of $5000, due on
two promissory notes given by Kreling
Bros, before the death of William Kreling.
In the original compiuint Mrs. Kreling
states that she, as executrix of the estate
ot lier deceased husband, paid 10 F. W.
Kreling the sum of $10,000 for certain con
siderations and under certain conditions,
one of the conditions being that he should
pay the money owing to the bank on the
two promissory notes.
The lower tribunal ordered F. W. Krel
ing to pay the money as agreed. He pro
tests that the order* should be reversed;
hence the petition.

A FIERCE BLAZE,
The Old Ixora Hall Again
Gutted by Leaping
Flames.
LOSS FIFTY THOUSAND.
The Fire Department Once More
Called Out on a General
Alarm.
GREAT DAMAGE BY WATER.
Hundreds of Electric L'gat and Tele
phone Wires Interfere With the
Firemen
The Doernbecher Furniture Manufac
turing Company's stock of furniture at 733
Mission street was gutted by flames last
evening and caused three alarms of tire to
be sounded from box 62. This was the sec
ond time during the week that the Fire
The Old Ixora Hall Building on Mission Street Again Threatened With Total Destruction by a
"Furniture" Fire.
Department was called out on a general i
alarm. The other occasion was also the :
destruction of furniture. ,
At five minutes before seven o'clock
several people passing on Mission street,
between Third and Fourth, saw the flames
in the top floor of the old Ixora Hall build
ing, a three-story structure, playing havoc
with the furniture. It seemed as though
tne top story was aflame from the front to
the rear. As soon as Acting Chief Engi
neer Dougherty reached the place he saw
that active measures had to be resorted to
or the whole block would go up in smoke
and a second alarm was turned in.
Althoueb confined in one large fire
proof brick building there was great dan
ger of it leaping the bounds and more ap
raratus was necessary, so the third call
for help wa3 scunded. In a little while
thousands of gallons of water were being
poured into tbe windows, and from the
top floor it ran in torrents to the stores be
low.
The second story was occupied by the
same firm as a iurnitnre storehouse, while
below wore the following business places:
No. 741 Mission Street, the American
Varnish Conipanv, Charles G. Schrar.fer
proprietor, and with him Frank La Faille,
an oil and varnish uÂ«ent.
No. 735, the Woodbine saloon, Fred
Wilte proprietor.
No. 733, the Unon Undertaking Com
pany, W. J. Mallady proprietor.
These places were literally Hooded, and
in some instances the damage by water
will be heavy.
As stated, the tire was in the third story,
bnt It did not lake loun to work its wiy
through the floor into the second Btory,
where tbe inflammable nature of the stock
and laree quantities of oil and varnish in
tensified tiie heat and made many think
that it would escape from tbe control of
the firemen.
The latter did heroic work, under the
cool command of Chief Dougbertv, in tbe
face of aererravating obstacle-.
In tbe first place the evening wind was
blowing a cale. T en there were trolley
wires of the Mission-street cable cars, and
a perfect network of telegraph, telephone
and the dangerous electric light wires. In
the midst of all these rose the tall water
tower, and although the stream was fre- !
qnently split by the obstructions named
it performed noble service. At ttie foot of
the tower stood the Siamese which con
centrated the streams of several steam en
gines.
The hook and ladder boys were not idle
by any means, for they quickly mounted
the roof of the parsonage of the old How
ard Presbyterian Church on the east
and the California Spring Manufacturing
Company's building on the south, and
from both directions powerful streams
were brought in play.
On the Minna street side the firemen
were equally active playing from the roofs
of the buildings. All of thi^ time Captain
Comstock's fire patrol boys were saving
property by removal or applying rubber
blankets.
About 8:30 o'clock tbe fire was literally
drowned out, and without having been
able to escape from the building.
This is the secend time the old Ixora
Hall building has been in flames, the first
time being about seven years ago, when a
quantity of furniture was destroyed on
the top floor. At that time the dancinir
hall was on the second story.
The building is a part of the Shiels es
tate, tbe ground being owned by William
Tischmeacher. Tbe Doernbecher Furni
ture Company has occupied the second
and third stories for several years, and
with this firm was the ageucv of the Sum
nÂ«l Beale Furniture Company. It will
take several days to learn the exact losses,
but from what can be learned, Doern
becher's stock was insured for about $30,
-000, and ita value was about $35,000 or
$40,000.
Mallady's damage whs about $1500. The
damage by water to Schaier'a stock of oils
could not be learned.
The saloon man's loss will not amount
to over a tew hundred dollars.
The damage to the building will not be
over $5000 or $6000, as the brick walls tyre
apparently in fair condition. The inte
rior walls of the two top stories were de
stroyed.
No one seemed to know the cause of the
fire, which apparently started in the mid
dle of the top floor. It is the custom to
close that part oi the building at 5 o'clock
on Saturdays, and wnen the employes left
yesterctav everything was all right, so far
as they could see. Mr. Scbaefer said that
after 6 o'clock, when he closed his store,
there was no evidence of danger overhead.
Those who tirst saw the blaze s?id that W
Beemed to burst^out all over the floor at
once, and this leads to the belief that it
was a case of spontaneous combustion in
tie repairing, oil and varnishing depart
ment.
During the progress of the fire thou
sands of people rushed to the scene of the
blaze, and Mission and Third streets were
Backed to the ropes stretched across the
streets by the police. In many instances
the firemen were sadly hampered in the
discharge of their duties by the curiosity
seekers. It was with great difficulty that
even the department wagons could get
through the masses after the second and
third alarms were sounded. One part of
the crowd on Third street paid dearly for
its gratification. An over-strained fire
hose burst in the midst of the great gath
ering and a hundred or more went home
sadder and wiser and drenched to the
skin.

1847 was appointed a member of the police
force in New Orleans. In .'a' months
he was promoted to " the position of cap

fear, favor or affection. â¢ When the gold
fever was at its height he resigned and
came to California, landing in this City in
1851. " rafffffMrnWHT

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 12, 1896.
JUDGE CONLAN
AS A DETECTIVE,
He Chases and Captures a
Petty Larceny
Thief.
HIS SUCCESSFUL RUSE.
Levi B. Gordon, an ex-Policeman
Who Jumped His Bonds,
Was the Man.
CHAEGED WITH STEALING MILK
The Judge Was Ably Assisted in the
Capture by Bailiff Kelly of
His Court
Judge Conlan distinguished himself yes
terday morning by chasing and capturing
Levi B. Gordon, an ex-policeman, for
whose arrest the Judge had issued two
bench-warrants last Monday.
Gordon, after his dismissal from the
fjree a few months ago, established a milk
route. He did not buy his milk from any
dairy, but adopted the original method of
stealing it in the early morning hours
from tue doorsteps of houses in the Mis
sion and Western Addition.
Complaints had been made by customers
to their milkmen and the Milk Dealers^
Association took the matter up. A watch
was set and Gordon was caueht in tiie act
on two occasions of stealing the milk.
He had given $100 cash bail for his ap
pearance, but later got back the money,
substituting a bond for $200. When the
cases were called in Judge Conlan's court
on Monday morning Gordon failed to ap
pear and the Ju-.lge issued bench-warrants
for his arrest and declared his bond for
feited. He had accepted the bond himself
and was disgusted when he discovered
that the sureties were worthless.
The Judge had spent several evenings
loooking for Gordon and yesterday morn
ing Bailiff Kelly called at his house on
Pftge street near Fillmore. He was de
lighted when Kelly told him that he bad
seen Gordon talkine to a woman at the
door of ahouseon Filimore s:rec-t.
'Why didn't yon arrest him," said the
Judpe, as he seized his hat and cane.
"Well." said Kelly, "I hadn't a gun,
neither had I my badge."
"Come along with me," said the Judge
as he hurried out, of tbe house. They
went to Fillmore street and Gordon was
still talking to the woman. As soon as
Gordon saw them he walked hurriedly in
the direction of Haight street. They fol
lowed at as swift a pace and when Gordon
reached the corner he ran. The Judge and
Kelly ran after him and Kelly yelled to
Gordon to stop. Gordon looked behind
and the Judge quickly placed his hand to
his hip pocket and shouted:
"1 command you to stop." Gordon
wheeled round and threw up his hands
begging the Judge not to shoot.
The Judge was unarmed, but the ruÂ«Â«e
was successful. Gordon wept and begged
for merry, but it had no effect. He waÂ«
placed in a passing Haight-street car, and
when the conductor was collecting the
fares he made an attempt to escape, but
the Judge and bailiff were too quick for
him. At Larkln and Market streets he
made another unsuccessful attempt to
escape.
Gordon was marched to the City Prison,
the Judge on his r igtit and Kelly on his
left, and his bonas were fixed at $1000 in
each case, so that he will not be able to
get out on worthies sureties again.
The Judge mourns the loss of his cane.
He had it in his right hand, and when he
made the biuff to pull his i\ volver in his
excitement he threw it away, and forgot
all about it till he got to the City Prison.
Gordon is sure to get six months on each
charge, as the evidence is strong against
him.
HEWLE'iVi ESTATE LOSES.
Peculiar Relation* of m Kich Man and a
\\ <. in. hi M hu Claimed to lie Hl* Child.
Judge Black yesterday granted the ex
ecutors of the will of the lute fi. P. Hewlett
permission to compromise with E. P.
Hewlett and Isabeile H. Offutt their
claims against the estate by giving Isabeile
H. Offutt credit for $21,500 on a note for
$33,500 she made in favor of the deceased
during his lifetime.
When the will of P. B. Hewlett was filed
for probate Mrs. Isabeile Offutt entered a
contest, claiming to be a daughter of the

estate for $8000, wnich he claimed was due
him from his father.
In his will P. B. Hewlett devised to his
eldest son, E. P. Hewlett, a house ani lot i

household furniture tsereon, and be

TRIUMPH OF HEALTH.
The grandest invention of the age for restoring the power and health of mankind. Perfected by all means known to science, it
is to-day the one successful remedy for the weaknesses so common in men and women. With the single object, restoring vitality, it
cures the thousand and one complaints resulting from error, overwork, excesses, worry and neglect of the physical body. It is the

Electricityâ the source of all the greatest achievements of modern scienceâ is as much a part of the human structure asthe
life blood Itself/ Upon this subtle force depends the healthy action of the kidneys, heart, stomach, liver and brain ; without it
there is no life, no health, no energy. It may be said with perfect truth that nine-tenths of the complaints of mankind can be
traced to a lack of electricity in the body. In it there is life, health, vigor, and when applied by this wonderful Electric Belt
many complaints can be cured after the failure of drug treatment. Dr. Sanden's Electric Bait has been before the public for
years, and for the past ten years its sales have grown until for the year 1896 there will be more of these famous Belts in use
I than of all other similar appliances in the world Its great improvements have enabled the patient to use it without the least
inconvenience. Instead of blistering the body with the sharp, jerking current given by other belts, it possesses Dr. Sanden's
Improved regulator, by means of which the curren' is under control of the wearer, and gives the mild, soothing effect, which
| strengthens the body without 'burn the flesh. There are many skeptical p3ople who doubt the value of Dr. Sanden's Elec-
I trie Belt, because they have been duped so much by the false promises of quacks in medicine, and that nothing is believed
;by them until it is proved. To those, and to the many thousands who believe their troubles beyond power of man to cure,
I the following grateful letters should act as a beacon light; they should convince the greatest skeptic, for they are prompted
by nothing but gratitude, and what will cure these men will.cure any case of similar nature. Will you not .pursue the same

Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt has become so famous for its cures that every person suffering from weakness or disease in
any form is desirous of learning the method pursued in this noble work. To give this information Dr. Sanden has published
a book called "Three Classes of Men," which has a reputation throughout the country as the mo3t truthful, honest and
straightforward publication of scientific facts relating to the use of electricity for the cure of disease. It gives many straight
truths, which will be appreciated by men who have wasted the power of manhood, and explains how best to regain and pre-
serve it. A pocket edition of this celebrated work will be sent by mall, closely sealed, free on application. If you can call at Dr.
Sanden's office ho will gladly., offer you his advice and medical assistance free of charge. If not, send for this book at once,
and it may save you much suffering and expanse. Call or address HfrSg^tfM^UKSfe^gih^ifc^rii'ft

PROF. M. L. CARNELLE,
The Celebrated Clairvoyant.
He reads the future without mistake, gives val-
uable Information on all affairs of life. He has
been pronounced the world over as the greatest
clairvoyant of the age. Through his advice and
work he has made a great many people happy.
He overcomes enemies, removes family troubles,
restores lost affections, causes happy marriage
with the one you love, removes evil influences,
bad habits and . gives correct Information on- law-
suits, divorces, lost friends, etc.: never-failing ad-
vice to young men on marriage an i how to choose
a wife for happiness, and what business - best
adapted to speedy riches: stock speculations a
specialty: and gives Indispensable advice to young
ladles on love, courtship and marriage; If your
lover Is true or false, with date of marriage; thou-
sands have been made happy by bis aid and ad-
vice. â ' â ; .-,- â  . â "â  , â  .â  â  â  "â¢â .*-;â¢
He advertises nothing bat what he can do!
He should not be classed with the many cheap
pretenders found in every city.. All who are In
trouble, whose fond hopes have been blasted, who
have been disappointed by the false predictions of
others, before giving up in despair, are invited to
call and be convinced â  of the above statement
without delay. Hundreds of p-rsons have an In-
fluence about them that they know nothing about.
Sometimes it Is caused by other persons, some- :
times It comes Itself. Come and have it removed.
Those who wish to consult a clairvoyant should
not fall to call. All business strictly confidential.
Letters containing 2-cent stamp answered. Par-
lors so arranged that yon meet no strangers.

Not Convinced of His Mistake Till He

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,}
908 Broadway, July 11. f
Mrs. B. L. Bpence of 1324 Linden street,
bad a novel experience when the overland
train came in the other night. She was
j met by a gentleman who attempted to
embrace her and who persisted in his de
termination till he was slapped.
Rev. and Mrs. J. Small went to the train
to meet the wife of Rev. George W.
Sweeney, who has come to Oakland on a
visit to friends. They were accompanied
by Mrs. Bpence, also a friend of Mrs.
Sweeney.
When the passengers alighted a gentle
man rushed up to Mrs. Spence and was at
tempting to embrace her when she re
sented.
"You've made a mistake, sir," said the
lady.
"Ob, no, I haven't," said the gentleman,
laughing.
Aa he spoke he made another advance
toward the lady.
"But you have," said the lady.
Tie gentleman was only encouraged by
the lady's opposition, and again prepared
to renew his demonstration of affection.
Mrs. Hpence was very much worked up
and protested strongly, but with no re
suit favorable to herself. The man refused
to be convinced that be had made a mis
take.
As he made a final attempt, Mrs, Spence
was forced to resort to a display of bellig
erency, and she administered to her per
sistent admirer a heavy bow in the face.
This had the desired effect, and the gen
tleman went off. Mrs. Spence says that
i.c undoubtedly mistook her for some one
he expected to meet and would not be con
vinced tnat he had made a mistake. She
is now wondering who the lady is that
b ars such a resemblance to her, and is on
the lookout to guard against any similar
demonstration in the future.
Good morning, have you read Thomas Slater's

ARRANGE A MEET,

gramme at Shell Mound
Park.
WANT TO JOIN THE L. A.W.
None of the Club's Records or
Meets Have Yet Been
Recognized.
CAPTAIN WILLIAMS TALKS.
When Fairly Discussel He Thinks the
0. C. C. Will Bs Admitted

Oakland Office Pan Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Jaly li. j
The Oakland Cycling Club's picnic and
race meet which will be held at Shell
Mound Park on the 16(11 inst. will brine;
out a large crowd and may probably re*
suit in some record breaking.
The O. C. C. is the Hading colored
cycling club on the coast and has a large
membership as well as a ladies' annex.
This is its second annual picnic and some
very valuable prizes are offered.
The captain of the ladies' annex is Mrs.
Johnson, who as Miss Allen lowered the
ladies' mile cycling record to 2:46 2-5 in
the race held under the auspices of the
San Jose Cycling Club at San Jose in De
cember of last year. Since that time Mrs.
Johnson has been looking for a race with
white lady cyclers for championship hon
ors. 6he is very ambitious, and speaking
of her open challenge, she said: "I now
hold the world's ladies' racing record and
I intend to retain it. Ido not wish to do
so unless it belongs to me, and the only
way to definitely decide the matter is for
these ladies to come to time and sho%v
what they can do. We hope to bring the
whii^and colored cyciers together soon,
and I take this step to start the ball a-roll
ine."
The programme for the meet is as fol
lows:
Grand wheel parade of ladles and gentle
men. Prizes for lady in neatest cycling cos
tume and for largest visiting dub.
One-mile race for members oi the O. C C.
only.
One-half mile dash for ladles. First priie,
gold xueilal; second prize, sliver medal.
Cnr-mile handicap.
Half-mile sera ton.
1 -hi tuti-j's open race. Weight 225 to 500
pounds.
Half-mile dash for boys under 18.
Two-mile tandem race, open, l'rizes valued
at f'i 50.
One-mile match race. C. Butler, O. C. C, and
N.Day; $25 a side.
The O. C. C. is very anxions to enter the |
League of American Wheelmen, but so far I
has been unsuccessful. In 1895 and early
in this year Captain H. F. Williams nmde
known the wishes of the club to the
national headquarters of the L. A. \V. t
but each time he received an in iirect
answer. He wrote to Chairman Welch of
San Francisco on Thursday, out has not
yet received a rooty.
"We are anxious to have our annual
meet ana our club recognized by the L. A.
W." said Captain Williams to-day. "We
have some good riders, both gentlemen
and Indie-, but none of our records are
kept, because we are not members of the
league. From what I understand, there

FORGOT HIS OLD MOTHER
Mrs John Griest Wants to Know
Where Her Son's Prop
erty Is.
An Appeal to the Court Shows That
Another Wcm-n Had the
Benefit cf It.
Oakland Off.ice San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, July 11. f
The sad spectacle of an old mother look
ing for her son to find support has just
come to light throueh an application of
the mother, Airs. John Griest, of Tunden,
North tichleswig, Germany, to Judge Ells
worth for any information regarding her
son and his property.
The letter was written in German, and
stated she was old, feeble and almost pen
niless. She had a sou who had left home
as a Malaxing man. He acquiied some
money and came to California, where he
invested it soon afterward. She heard of
his death, but never learned where he had
invested his earnings. She thought he
might be in Alameda County.
ltiis morning it was ascertained that
one M. L. R. Wind, the name given by
Mrs. Griest, had died in San Francisco in
1895. P. G. Larsen was named executor
by Mr. Wind in his will, which bequeathed
all of his property to Mrs. Jacooson. It
was appraised at $3354 M) and yielded
12978. She has since died and now Ehse
Margarethe Marten of Heide, Prussia, has
wuat was left.
The estate was closed up long ago, but
no mention was ever made of a mother by
the son, who se o med to have forgotten all
about her.

TEACHERS SHOULD MARRY
P. R. Baone Thinks Marriage
Is Not a Fail
ure.
He Would Have Every Teacher the
Parent of at Least Two
Children.
BERKELEY, Cal., July 11.â There are
several scores of timorous women teach
ers in Berkeley who fear that their official
heads uay soon be cut off and their sal
aries stopped, so far as the School Depart
ment is concerned, because they have not
taken unto themselves husbands.
They are in a quandary to know whether
they will be required to gft married soon
if they wish to stay in the department,
ana the immediate probability of such a
move has caused no little excitement
among some of the feminine pedagogues.
This feeling of fear has been aroused
among them by the recent stand taken by
President P. R. Boone of the Board of
Education, who declared that married
women teachers are preferable to single
ones.
"I am disposed in favor of married
teachers," says President Boone, "pro
vided they have nor. been married too
long. In Chicago the best teachers are
said to be married women. In Philadel
phia they are at no disadvantaee. In
Boston they have proved excellent teach
ers and in Cleveland and Denver they are
found to be first class.
"If I were going to buildup a new sys
tem of education in a city I think I should
make it a condition that every applicant
P. R. Borne, President of Berkeley's
Board of Education, Who Declares
i hat Only Married Women Should
Teach School.
for the position of teacher, male or female,
bbouid be married, and married young,
with the additional requirement that they
be the mother or father of at least two
children.
"Tne paternal instinct conveyed in the
schoolrooms would prove an additional
merit. There has long been complaint
that in most of our schools in American
cities there are too many single inexperi
enced teachers, especially women, who are
well up in science, norrnai- school meth
ods aud pedagogical theories, but who
lack one essential, and that is bow to
handle the young. In the mother teacher
you have the safer assurance. Another
of the essentials of a pood teacher, single
or married, is life, vitalityâ the ability to
fieht against becoming the victim of rou
tine.
"The supreme quality," says President
Boone. "in any teacher is the Ire-giving
quality â that power Of conveying a vital
impulse which clothes the dead fact with
color and life, it is the absence of this
element which often condemns a teacher
to a cheerless and routine life."
The pror-osition of President Boone to
require that teachers be married is only in
its embryo state, yet there seems to be
strong indications that it will be put into
tangible form before a great lapse of
time.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call.)
908 Broadway, July 11. J
A special meeting of the Board of Trade
was held last night for the purpose of
considering and adopting some course of
action in the matter of harbor improve
ments, as action being taken by certain
members of the community, coupled with
t c efforts of Dr. McLane and others of
Alameda, were liable to prove detrimental
to the interests of Oakland and her har
bor.
Directors James P. Taylor, M. J. Keller,
H. O. 'irowbridge, J. Tyrrel, A. Kayser,
A. D. Pryal and Craigie Sharp were pres

committee to have full power to act:
Besnlved, That the resolutions adopted by
the Oakland .board of Trade in January of the
present year' touching the improvement of
Oakland harbor bi> reaffirmed in so far as they
are applicable to the present situation.
Resolved, That copies of the aforesaid resolu
tion, also the memorial and signatures then
presented 10 the California delegation in Con
gress, be presented 10 Colonel Suter by a com
mittee of the board consisting of James P
Taylor, H. O. Trowbridne. Edson F. Adams Â«nd
M. J. Keller, with a view of urging upon him
the necessiiy of allowing the recommenda
tions of the Government engineers resurrfinij
the rotation of the work on the Oakland har
bor to prevail without any modification or
Change, so that the dredging of the channel
into the San Francisco Bay shall be first done,
and then lv its natural order will follow the
com pie lion of the tidal canal.
The secretary was instructed to forward
to Colonel Suter by special messenger a
copy of the resolution, and also a com

STRIPPED A HORSE.
A Sneak Thief Take* the H-irness Front
an Animal While Attached

HAYWARDS, Cal., July 11.â A very
mean robbery was committed here
Wednesday night. There was a meeting
of the Young People's Guild at the resi
dence of Mrs. Fischer on Castro street.
Several of the guests left their rigs in
front of the house. Among these was tne
phaeton of 8. D. Warren, in which Miss
Christenson had attended the euild meet
ing. When Miss Christenson wanted to
go borne she was greatly surprised to find
the phaeton, but to miss the horse. The
thief bad unhitched the horse and stolen
the harness and then turned him loose.
The animal easily found his way back to
Mr. Warren's place. The robber evidently
wanted nothing but harness, for Miss
Christen son's shawl, that was placÂ»d over
the horse to keep the mosquitoes off, had
been neatly folded and placed on the
buggy seat. Mr. Warren has new harness
now and is driving around looking for the
thief. _

Haywards Veterans Are An
swered by a Cemetery
Trustee.
The Old Hem? Gtnrd Did N,t Pro

Cost.
Oakland Office San Francisco CallJ
808 Broad wMy, July 11. J
The story published in Tvs Call a few
days ago regarding the inability of the
Haywards G. A. R. veterans to obtain a
aoidiess' plat at Lone Tree Cemetery has
called forth much discu-sion.
H..W. Rice, who is one of the trustees of
the cemetery, says that the facts are not
fully understood. " * j '
"When the Hay wards Guard disbanded
they had $670," said Mr. Rice to-day.
â¢â¢Each member was entitled: to an equal
share of this money. Some of the mem
bers suggested that a library bo estab
lished for. the town. Others . thought to
have it divided among the members, but
when it was mentioned that they estab
lish a. cemetery and a vote was taken it
was unanimously resolved that the money
should be used for that purpose and the
cemetery be for the town of Hay wards.
"It Mas (bought that each member of
the guard should have a small lot free,
but when it was found that the land cost
$900, the fencing $530, surveying and lay
ing out lots $403, besides tan windmill,
trees, tools and many other. wants too
numerous to mention, the live trustees
found it necessary to take money out of
their private pockets and each one paid
$20 for a small lot at the same price that
they sold to any other citizen. So. lots
were. ever trivea away, and no person ever
donated any money to the cemetery.
"The trustees gave their time 10 help
Boardrnan do the surveying and furnished
stakes and sharpened them, all without
cost to the cemetery. Money was hired at
a high rate of interest, but afterward was
found at a lower rate. The rive trustees
gave, their joint notÂ« for the loan. Tha
trustees do not ;retuÃe to meet, the Veter
ans. The communication from i lie Vet
erans s'utes,". 'Should you" be willing to
consider the , 'proposition' the undersigned
committee will be glad to meet you.'
The trustees of Lone Tree Cemetery had
no power to do what was. asked, therefore
it was not- necessary to have a meeting."
It is thought- that if the .Veterans and
j cemetery trustees come together that a
plan can be arranged that will be mutually
agreeable. ~- " : v ;'â  "

The Carnival Committee's Hopes
of Gocd Financial Aid Are
Erigfctening.
Merchants, Real Â£ ta'.e Men and
Large Corporations Are
Interested.
Within two hours yesterday morning .
the special committee of the Carnival of
the Golden. Gate received assurances from
lartje corporations, hotels and real estate
men winch led it to believe that by
the next meeting of the executive commit
tee on Tuesday atternoon it will be able to
report pledges of not less than $20,000.
W. H. Mills and Henry J. Crocker
called upon' H. E. Hnhtingtofl. of the
Southern Pacific Company and-t^'ueed the
matter before him. He stated that the
matter had "been discussed, and- that he
was confident the board of directors, at its
meeting on Monday, would donate. a large
appropriation, and also expressed the
same sentiment as regards the investment
of the Market-street Railway. Company.
Colonel Stone, who visited the hotels,
reported that $5000 at least could be ex
pected from them. This only refers to the
larger hotels in the City. The, private
hotels and larger boarding-houses have
not yet been canvassed. . â¢
David Rich was only able to see two of
the larger real-estate dealers, but has re
ported that the outlook is equally as favor
able as.. Colonel Stone Mated. These two â¢
firms are ready 10 contribute $1000 between
them. .;---. | h'-y:;:- . ] ...-â â â .â . , .
; To-morrow the committee will again
continue their labors. Saturday, being a half
holiday, it was impossible to visit all the
places that were expected, ana the re
mainder ' will be seen : to-morrow. , The
water, gas and electric light companies
have not yet been visited. H. J. Crocksr,
outside of the railroad company's sub
scription, has agreed not to bring in less
than $5000 at the nut meeting of the com
mittee. In addition to the larger amounts
promised, several smaller offer's of invest
ment on the carnival proposition have
been made to the various members of -the
committee. .After: the meeting of .the
special committee on Monday afternoon
toe smaller Aubbcriptions will be called in.
The executive committee have decided
to offer a special premium to Newman &
Leviaon for the display of carnival colors
in their windows yesterday. The idea of
the committee was - for a general decora
tion of the windows yesterday afternoon,
in order to attract attention to the carni
val, but many of 'the larger store-* found
it impossible to arrange tneir windows in
time. In recognition of- the fact that
Newman & Levisonmade this sacrifice,
the committee: feel that some regard
should be given them.
v Their' display, was divided into three
sections, the central figure in each being
that of a young lady dressed â¢in either
â¢ blue, gold or I cardinal. . Ribbon in fan
tastic shapes is used in profusion -running
from L the? back? of the windows, to the
spider web close.' to the pane. '-"';:
The center tigure is a representation of
California, in yellow, with a harp illustra- .
tive of the carnival spirit. This display
will be continued for public inspection
until Monday â¢
. The benefit at the Columbia Theater on
Thursday afternoon promises to bring con
siderable, money to the .- carnival Â fund.
Each member of the executive committee
has determined to dispose ot not less than
fifty tickets, and some are hopeful of dis
posing of even more.,. This will be in ad
dition to the premium, for boxes and logea
at the auction sale to be held at the Mer
chants' Exchange on Tuesday, at 1 o'clock.
The entire proceeds of '.the benent . will be
given to the carnival fund. .*

MET DEATH 111 A
DRUNKEN BRAWL,
Jealousy and Strong Drink
Wrought Quinn's
Undoing.
WAS A WICKED FIGHTER
Died While Maintaining His Rep
utation As the Best Man of
the Battery.
KELLY'S PLAUSIBLE STORY .
Peculiar State of Discipline and Mor
als Among the Men
Disclosed.
Private Joseph j5. Quinn held the repu
tation of being the most dangerous and
the readiest fist-fighter in Battery E. That
is one of the reasons why the men yester-
Private James Kelly and the Man lie Is Alleged to Have Killed With One
Powerful Stroke of a Razor. Jealousy, Inflamed, by Liquor, Is the Motive
Ascribed for tbe Deed.
day spoke regretfully of their former mess
mate's untimely end, and that is one of
the reasons why his end was untimely.
Many a good man in the regiment had felt
the sting of Quinn's trained "dukes," and
though they admitted in speaking of him
yesterday that he was over ready for a
fight, this circumstance detracted nothing
from their admiration. In other respects he
was honest, straightforward and a good
soldier.
There was also a woman in the tragedy
who figured rather vaguely, her part being
obscured by the drunken condition ot the
participants in the fracas.
There were four eye-witnesses to the
fatal stroke for which Private James
Kelly is now confined on a charge of mur
der. Of these, only one, John P. Jones, is
a particularly competent witness. The
other threeâ Harry C. Mills, Henry Kamp
schmidt and John Whalen â were very
much under the influence of liquor.
Kampschmidt declares he was so drunk
he can recollect nothing. Whalen is a
damaging witness against Kelly, but the
fact that he was himself encaged in the
brawl ami immediately after the cutting
ran away and didn'i show up till yester
day morning tends to throw some dis
credit on his reliability.
All of the witnesses to the affair were
locked in the guardhouse at Fort Mason
yesterday afternoon, and no one was
allowed to see them. The men who were
at \&T-e were instructed not to talk, and
â¢ every effort was made to keep the affair as
quiet as possible. At 4 o'clock Detective
Ben Boben and Officer Harrigan visited
the fort and the witnesses were brought
before them and examined.
Kampschmidt was the first witness
called. He, however, didn't remember
anything except that he was very drunk
on the night of the 10th. Detective Bohpn
feela confident he will remember more
when he wishes to.
Wbalen's story tvus that Quinn, Mills,
KamDschmidt, Kelly and himself had bad
a difficulty in the afternoon. In the even
ing about 8:30 they went to the City, and
after drinking some returned to the post
about 10:45. They went to the post ex
change, or canteen, to have a glass of beer,
and met the crowd with whom they had
quarreled in the afternoon. They all
started for the barracks and the argument
was continued on the way. Quiun struck
Mills and knocked him down. Kamp
schmidt then strnck W halen. When Mills
fell Whalen eaysbesaw Kelly make a rush
for Quinn, ottering vile oaths as he went.
"I am not sure whether Mills hit Kelly,"
he said, "or whether Kelly ran, but the
next time I saw Kelly he was behind the
hose reel. Qninn started away to see how
Kampschmidt and I were faring. As he
was approaching me I saw Kelly strike at
him and Quinn staggered toward rue, say
ing, 'Jack, lam killed; they have cut my
jugular.' I held him in my arm?. The
blood was running from his neck. The
only man I saw near Quinn was Kelly,who
wbs then running up the steps into the
quarters. I could follow him by his white
shirt. * * * Quinn gasped 'Tell Min
nie,' or something similar, and as Quinn
and I had an appointment at 11:30 with
Mamie I Knew what he meant and went to
tell her."
Whalen said he walked about town a
while, went to bed and didn T t get up until
6 a.m., when he came back to the post.
Mills' storydiffers remarkably from that
of Whalen. He says the whole trouble
was between himself and Quinn. Quinn
stole $1 from a crap game which he was
playing with Mills. Mills remonstrated and
Quinn insisted on fighting. Mills didn't
want to h<:ht and the matter was dropped
temporarily. Later in the night, about
10:30, Quinn returned from town with
Wuaien and insisted on a tight. Mills
again refused, and ali started for the bar
racks. On the way Quinn struck Mills and
knocked him down. He then crawled
away. In the afternoon he had seen Quinn
brandishing a razor and threatening to
hurt an y body who molested him.
John P. Jones told how he had watched
the fighting near the barracks. Just as
Quinn approached Kampschmidt he saw
Kelly ruu up behind Quinn ana then run
immediately to his barracks.
Kelly's cap and a razor, identified aa
hit, were found near the body of Quinn,
Privare Feely says Thursday afternoon
Kelly borro wed his'strop to sharpen a razor.
In afew minutes he returned with another
razor to strop, sayins he had traded the
other one. A razor was found locked in
Kelly's box yesterday. â  -
A peculiar circumstance is that no blood
was found upon Kelly's clothes, though
Quinn's head had been almost severed
from his body. Kelly was seen to go im
mediately to his hunk, so he could have
had no time to change his clothes. He
says he wore a blue shirt, though Whalen
says he followed his movements by the
white shirt he wore.
Kelly was known as a qufit and peace
ful man, and was considered rather stupid.
He is eaid to have had a grudge against
i Quinn because the latter had stolen the
: affections of the woman known as Mamie.
: Both Kelly and the woman deny this, but
; that there was a woman causing trouble
' betwett the men is generally accnowl
! edged at the post and among the woman's
1 associates.
This young woman has lived for two
years in the neighborhood of Pine and
Dupon; streets. Friday afternoon last
Quinn moved her from 514 Pine street to
711 California.
Kelly was seen in the City Prison yester
day. He had had a good night's rest and
looked quiet and composed. He still pro
tests his innocence and has engaged an at
torney to look after his interests.
He had been cautioned by his attorney
I to keep his mouth shut, but he gradually
1 unburdened his mind.
"We were all more or less drunk last
! night," he said, "and about 8 o'clock
Quinn and Mills got into a tignt. I acted
the part of peacemaker and, after some
trouble, got them separated. They were
hot after each other, and arranged to
meet this morning and fight it out. There
were a lot of us, and most of them were in
a fighting mood. Mills could scarcely be
restrained from tackling Quinn again.
"After the fight Quinn. Mills, Whalen,
j Kampschmidt, Coleman and myself went
I to the canteen, where we remained drink
ing until we left, about half-past 10 o'clock.
' Sergeant Mink was in the canteen and left
about the same time. 1 went straight to
my bunk and was fast asleep wheif I was
awakened about 11 o'clock and taken to
the guardhouse. 1 suppose several of ray
comrades had seen me going from the can
teen to my bunk. 1 was very drunk.
"It is not true that my hands were cov
ered with blood. There was a spot of
blood between two of the fingers of my
left band, which must have come from
Quinn's mouth, as he was bleeding at the
mouth when I separated him and MiJls.
"The razor found near Quinn's body
was not mine. I did not have a razor that
afternoon or night with me. My razors
were in my locker and will be found there.
"I was friendly with Quinn that night.
We had a slight disagreement about eigh
teen months ago, but that soon blew over.
I did not know his associates, and it is not
true that be and I quarreled about a
woman in the City. I don't know any
woman that he knew, and there is not the
slightest truth in that statement.
"I emphatically declare my innocence
and it will be established yet."
Mamie K. Quinn, as she calls herself,
was seen at 711 California street yesterday
afternoon. In reply to inquiries she said :
"I was engaged to be married to Mr.
Quinn. I have known him for two year^.
He was very kind to me and we were to be
married in a few months, as his time in the
service was nearly up. I do not know
Kelly and never was acquainted with him.
I saw Mr. Qninn yesterday afternoon,
wben I moved from Pine street into this
house.
"I did not hear that he was dead until
3 o'clock this morning. I Had no idea that
( had anything to <lo with the quarrel and
did not know of any trouble. I went to
the Morgue to see his body. I was para
lyzed and almost frantic when l heard
that he was murdered. I never knew of
his Laving a quarrel or that he had en
emies. It was all a surprise to me. lie
was the best friend I ever had and was a
very fine man. He was secretary of the
social club and in every way a nice man.
"I was born and brought up in San
Francisco. Yes, lam an American girl. I
do not want my name or my picture in the
newspapers, as I knew nothing of the
quarrel which caused his death."
Mamie K. Quinn is a woman 21 years
old. She has chestnut hair, gray eyes and
is below medium stature. Her home was
with her parents at the Mission until three
years ago.
The social club which she mentioned in
ncr talk is the Palm City Social Club,
which organization has rooms on the sec
ond floor of 514 Xearny street. As far as
diligent inquiry can ascertain, the prime
object of ttiis institution is to promote
sociability among its members. Quite a
number of en.isted men of the United
States army belong to it for the reason
perhaps that promotion of any kind in the
reeular' army is very slow. Four soldiers
of Battery E are said to be members, and
Private Quinn was the secretary.
Recently a rule was made tnat "no la
aies" should be admitted to the social
functions of the club. On the night of
July 4 the members of tbe club enter
tained themselves and admitted several
guests of tbe other sex. and among these
was Mamie Quinn. In the due course of
promoting sociability a keg of beer and
eight gallons of wine were served as re
freshments. During the evening a dis
pute arose in which the secretary's guest
and another woman took a prominent part.
Following words were blows and
scratches and squalls. So since then the
functions of sociability have been pro
moted by the male members alone.
The military investigation of the causes
which induced the traÂ«edy at Black Point
may convince the War Department that
some attraction more alluring than the
canteen or post exchange may be required
to keep enlisted men on the reservation.
The murder was officially reported yes
terday moraing to General James W.
Forsyth, commanding the Department of
California.
The report was made in due form ac
cording to army regulations by Captain
Anthony W. Vogdes, who commands the
post at Fort Mason. There is scarcely a
doubt that the murder was committed by
James Kelly, a private belonging to the
same battery.
There is sure to be thorough inquiry by
the military and civil authorities into the
causes which led to the tragedy.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 12, 1896.
WHY SLAVERY IN
CHINATOWN LIVES,
Fancy Prices Paid for
Women Who Barter
Their Souls.
RECOBD OF ONE TEAR.
Over Fourteen Hundred Chinese
Landed at This Fort Dur
ing 1895.
NEARLY ONE HUNDBED WOMEN
It Is Believed That 50 Per Cent of
This Number Gained Admission
by Fraud.
Slavery a hundred times more degrad
ing and disastrous in its effects than that
which found its way into America more
than a hundred years ago and which was
perpetuated for nearly three-quarters of a
century, continues to thrive and prosper
in Chinatown. It was thought at one
time th%t this heinous traffic â tbis barter
ing and selling of human beings for vile
purposes â bad been practically stamped
out. Recent developments, however,
would seem to indicate that the practice
is carried on even more extensively than
in the halcyon days of the Chinese certifi
cate-forger.
Every steamer from the Orient to this
port has on board from five to ten Chinese
womea, or rather girls, ranging in age
from 12 to 20.
For instance, the Coptic brought nine
on her list trip and the Rio Janeiro seven.
True, some of these women, as in nearly
al 1 cases, failed to land because of a mis
carriage of the plans of the "importer,"
but what is lost in return passage money
is made ud many times in other ways.
Dick \Villiam3, now under indictment
by the Federal Grand Jury for fraudu
lently landing Chinese, and whose sum
mary dismissal from the Customs service
was announced in The Call a few days
ago, is responsible for the statement that
since his retirement in April last more
Chinese, men and women, have been
landed at the port of San Francisco than
during any similar period within the past
two years. In view of the fact that Col
lector Wise refuses to give for publication
the number of Chinese landed during the
year 1895, or for the fiscal year ending July
1, the claim set up by the ex-Chinese In
spector is not capable of either proof or
refutation, except in a general way.
There is to-day in Chinatown, according
to good authority, no less than 400 Chinese
girls and young women leading lives of
sin, the profits of which fall into the ca
pacious pockets of Chinese firms and white
aids. Those familiar with the peculiar
traits of the San Francisco Chinese atfirm
that they rarely ever sell their daughters
for vile purposes, notwithstanding their
greed for gold and the luxuries il can buy.
If this statement be true, then the 400
girl and women slaves in Chinatown must
come from over the sea.
It has been established that ''the wife of
a Chinese person other than a laborer who
may be legally domiciled in the United
States and whose legal status as such wife,
as the marriage relation is understood in
the United Slates, is established to the sat
isfaction of the Collector of Customs at the
port of her arrival, may be permitted to
enter the United States." It is also held
that the children of Chinese per-ons who
may be born while such persons are legally
domiciled in the United States, and who
may have departed therefrom, may be
permitted to land on their return when
the Collector is satisfied that they were in
fact born in United States territory.
That these women come from some
other place than San Francisco is not de
nied. That there is an immense profit in
the business may be readily seen when it
is known that girls of 14 and 15 range in
price from $700 to $1200. From sources
other than Collector Wise it is learned that
during the year 1895 no less than 1300 men
and nearly 100 women landed at this port.
A gentleman familiar with Custom-house
affairs says that from 25 to 50 per cent of
this nuniber have no legal ri^ht here.
Under the old condition of affairs the
average price paid for landing these peo
ple was $200, but it now costs oniy about
$75. On the assumption that one-fourtu
of thoce who landed here iv 1895 did so I
fraudulently, it is plain that somebody |
cleared nbout $18,000. Add to tbis the
price of the twenty-five women, atan aver
age of $800 a head, and another neat sum
resultsâ $2<\ooo. or nearly $40,000 all tolo. i
For the tirst six mouths of the present i
year it is given out unofficially that 700 j
Chinese have landed at this port. Of this
number sixty-two were women. The
heaviest part of the year's traffic is yet to
come: so if the same proportion is kept
up, anywhere from 1400 to 1500 Chinese
will have landed at this not when Decem
ber 31 next conies. Or the Chinese who
visit the parent land during the year, not
all return. Yet, as a matter of fact,
there are more Chinese coming in than
going out.
Just how the thing is managed no one
seems to know. It is practically impossi
ble for Collector Wise to personally inspect
the certificate of every Chinese, hence it
follows that those under him, and the
attorneys, must do the major portion of
the work. Only a few days aeo a Chinese
appeared at the Collector's office with the
statement that he bad recently returned
to San Francisco, and desiring to go to his
place of business in the country, wanted
some kind of a written document showing
that he had a right to be in America.
"Where is your certificate?" asked the
Collector.
"Accidentally burned in Hongkong,"
was the reply.
"How did you land, then?"
"On a merchant's certificate," answered
the Celestial, and then it developed that
this evidence was also iacking. Finally it
was agreed that if the Chinese would fur
nish a photograph the Collector of the
Port would certify on the back that the
bearer "said he was a merchant" and had
landed here on a given day. Section 2 of
the McCreary act says:
When an application is made by a Chinaman i
for entrance Into the United States ou the j
ground that he was formerly engaged in this
country as a merchant he should establish by
the testimony of two credible wum-SMS other
thitn Chinese the fact that he conducted such
business as hereinbefore defined for at least
one year before his departure from the United
States, and that during such year he was not
engaged in the performance of any manual
labor except such as whs necessary In the con
duct of his business as such merchant, and in
default of such proof shall be refused landing.
It is presumed that the Chinese above
mentioned was properly identified by "two
credible witnesses other than Chinese," or
he could not have landed. But, on the
other hand, the law makes a very clear
provision for lost certificates. Duplicates
may be obtained at any time on presenta
tion of proof to the Collector of Internal
Revenue that the party applying for the
copy is the person named in the original
certificate, ft appears that this was not
done by the Chinese in question, and his
failure to do 30 leaves room for consider
able speculation.
One of the most potent arguments ad
vanced by those familiar with Chinese
affairs that hundreds ot celestials, male j
and female, fraudulently land at this port
yearly, is that out of every shipload from
one to ten Chinese are found who have no
earthly right to land. They all have cer
tificates of a kind, but they fail to pass
muster when brought before the Collector.
A round trip from China to San Fran
cisco is expensive, and the return money
must be in the ship company's hands be
fore the "merchant," '"laborer," "wife" or
"daughter" is allowed on board. It fol
lows, therefore, that there must be some
sort of assurance given tnat a successful
landing will be made or the money-loving
Chinese could never be induced to part
with their gold.
One of the practices at this port, and
one which probably assists in deceiving
the officers, is to allow local Chinese to go
aboard ship any day from 12 to 1 and talk
with their brethren from across the sea. It
is said that the incoming Chinese are then
coached in such a way as to almost defy
the most careful cross-examination. There
are always "reputable" white men willing
to affirm anything, there being numerous
examples of this during the past twelve
monttas.
Up to three weeks ago Louie Quong, the
Chinese interpreter suspended at the time
Dick Williams lost bis official head, was
permitted to go aboard every China
steamer and mingle with the Chinese pas
sengers. Finally it occurred to Collector
Wise that in view of Quong's suspension
he could be dispensed with. Since the
time mentioned the interpreter has made
himself scarce around the Mail dock. It
is thought by some that to this is due the
failure .to land four Chinese women who
came in the next steamer only to be sent
back on the return voyage. It was com
mon talk in customs circles that an ex
ofhcial had agreed to land the four women
for a well-known procuress on Jackson
street, the consideration being $2700. In
some way the scheme sprung a leak aud
the intended slaves are now bounding over
tue waves in the direction of the Flowery
Kingdom. Similar cases happen with each
steamer, hut'there are more "wives" and
"daughters" landed than go back. The
figures for the year 1896, if obtainable, will,
therefore, be looked for with great interest
by those concerned in such affairs.
Incidentally it may be remarked that
the fight between Collector Wise and
Special Agent Moore is still- on. It is
talked around the Federal building that
Major Moore has his eye on one or two
other inspectors and at the proper time
will spring another big surprise. So far
the special agent has won out in every
instance, his most important victories be
ing the dismissal of Cleary and Williams
and the suspension of the latter's friend,
Louie Quong. It is said that when the
next United States Grand Jury convenes
facts will be laid before them looking to
the interpreter's indictment.
In the meantime Chinese are being
fraudulently landed from each incoming
steamer. If Collector Wise could person
ally examine each case it is believed that
the alleged business would be stopped.
GODFREY AT IT AGAIN.
The Marine Fireman Swears Out a
Warrant for .fames Muroney't
Arrest.
The love of James Godfrey, the marine
fireman, for Catherine Nugent, the buxom
proprietor of a lodging-house at 28 Minna
street, will end in a tragedy.
It was only last Monday that Godfrey
appeared before Judge Campbell for dis
turbing the peace, and tbe Judge then
warned him that if he ever came before
him again he would fix him so that he
would not be able to annoy Miss Nugent
again.
The Judge was merciful, as Godfrey said
he was to leave next day with tbe whale
back steamer City of Everett.
Yesterday morning Godfiey appeared In
Judge Joachimsen's court and swore to a
complaint charging James Maroney with
assault to murder. Maroney and W.
Tr.icey, Miss Nueent's accepted lover, are
boarding at 28 Minna street and have
both figured in Godfrey's numerous cases
in the Police Courts.
Godfrey said he was going along Minna
street on his way to tht? steamer Mexico
yesterday morning when Maroney fired a
shot at him. The bullet whizzed past his
head and nearly knocked off his hat.
FIRI -ESCAPE CLIMBER.
Burglary on the Third Floor of the St.
Nicholas Hotel.
A daring burglar successfully got away
wiih $75, a gold watch and chain and a
diamond collar button from the room of
tester Herrick on the third floor of the
Si. Nicholas Hotel, on Thursday night.
The matter was reported at Police Head
quarters, and Detect yes Silvev and Egan
were detailed to investigate. They did so,
and came to the conclusion that the
burglar had climbed up the water-pipe to
tbe rire escape on the Hayps-street side of
the hotel. Then be climbed up tbe fire
escape to the window of Herrick's room,
opened it, and by that means was able to
commit the burglary. There is no clew to
tne burglar.

FUK FOES
CALLED TO ARMS,
Mayor Sutro 'Says the
Battle Must Be Pre
pared For
BEFORE NEXT CONGRESS.
The Original Committee of Fifty
to Convene on Thurs
day.
HUNTINGTON'S LAST DITCH.
His Only Hope Now Is in Influencing
Legislators in December
Next.
Mayor Sutro has already begun prepara
tions for renewing the tight against the
funding bill, and has called a meeting of
the committee of fifty, the organization
which has made itself so thoroughly felt
during the battle before the last session of
Congress, to be' held in his office at the
City Hall on Thursday morning next at
10 o'clock.
Mayor Sutro firmly believes that the
time when an enemy seems to sleep is the
time to be most alarmed, and will urge the
committee tot>egiu preparing its ammuni
tion for a terrific struggle during the ses
sion of Congress that opens at Washing
ton during tha first week in next Decem
ber.
He says that this will be the dying gasp
of his old enemy, the "octopus," and that
if it failed in its atteraut to foist the fund
ing bill on Congress the attempt will never
again be made.
"Though most people say that the fund
ing bill is dead," said the Mayor yester
day, "I know better. I know t:iat old ras
cal Huntington and his crew too well to
believe that he is going to let that meas
ure on which he has spent thousands â
yes, hundreds of thousands of dollars â go
by the board without making a desperate
effort to saddle it on this Nation.
''His- kind work while honest people
sleep, and he has shown many times tjlat
when he is quiet he is merely cooking up
a scheme to mate his fight stronger than
ever. But we will beat him, just as we
have done before.
"I figure it this way. Huntington
knows that with the plank in the Demo
cratic platform apainst the funding bill
and a like plank sure to be in the Populist
platform that the chances of Congress
being â after next election â more favorable
than the present are very slim, and he will
make every effort to push his thieving bill
through before the newjy elected legisla
tors can come into office. He must be met
with a bold front and a battle that will
drive him back defeated.
"Every man who has the good of the
country at heart should begin now urging
on his representative in Congress the neces
sity of defeating the bill for the last time.
"The committee of fifty will bombard
Congress with ami-funding literature as it
did before, and while I know that the fight
will be a haru one I believe that we will
win out. J> ___^______^__

*#ll 111 J. & F. ftJititj^LjKÃ.Having only a shining silver quarter of
a dollar in my pockets, I started forth to
be a prince for a day in gay San Francisco
on this amount of cash. The problem was
bow to get at least two good meals, to
visit the leading places of interest in town,
to keep abreast of the news, current litera
ture, etc, of the time, to hear one or two
tine concerts of instrumental music of
high class, and generally to have a really
ropai time on two bits. My instructions
included an admonition not to accept fa
vors on account of personal acquaintance,
the purpose of this being to have the net
result such as may be achieved by any
person who is much alive to the possibili
ties inhering ir. existing local conditions.
Keen and pungent odors proceeding
from open doorways on East street sug
gested gustatory delights, and a police
man, who was inducted into the condition
of the royal exchequer, "opined" that in
this neighborhood breakfast could be most
satisfactorily obtained.
"You see it is this way," said the knight
of the locust club. "You can go into this
office and get a ticket which will entitle
you to a free breakfast at the Salvation
Army Lifeboat; or you can go around
into Jackson street and get a pint of wine
and some meat stew for a nickel, but I
would not advise that, because the wine is
the dregs of vats; or you can go into one
of these places and get a large glass of
steam beer and something to eat for 5
cents."
Five minutes later the edge of the appe
tite of the morning was beine dulled rap
idly through the agency of three shiny
frankfurter sausages, bread ad libitum
and potations from a deep glass in which
foamed the amber liquid popularly known
as steam beer. The sausages were evi
dently cooted by a cUef. The smooth and
' burnished exterior indicated the interior
to have been properly prepared. Sightly
and shapely like the "lady fingers" made
by the pastry cooks, they were as easy to
take in one's digits, and they crackled
deliciously at the first pressure of the in
cisors. Then from them was exhaled a
fragrant odor which impelled a flow of
gastric juice and caused expectation to
run riot. Here was a beginning of which
JEscuiapius could approve ; upon which a
philosopher like Seneca might look with
satisfaction, and which would call forth
the commendatory nod of broad-girthed
Gambrinus.
Upon the surface of amber-colored beer
floated foam as evanescent and light as
thistle down. The receptacle holding the
beer was as deep and as musical, as it was
clintced against another, as a beli of Shan
don "That sounds so grand on the River
Lee." Ciearly through its translucent
sides could be observed the sparkling effer
vescence, the riotous ascent of sparkling
globules which conferred, as a reward for
patronage of a plebeian beverage, a delight
ful tang, in which was all the lusty flavor
of sun-kissed fields of bearded barley,
waving and rustling in the wind. The re
porter moved nearer the bread dish. There
was a general human gravitation in the
same direction. The "barkeep" looked on
benignly.
Squared off before this array, as the
frankfurter imparted its sweetness, the
staff of life lent its staying and blood-mak
ing qualities, and the beer percolated
soltly as cool spring water drips from a
mossy spring down a grateful throat, not |
staying nor speeding, the clouds of yester
day vanished as a wmith. The present be
came radiant with expectation, money
was dross and the fitureâ i. c., this one
<iay of princeship â wa^fi lied with premoni
tions of pleasing accomplishment.
Ail this time other odors were blown i
about, like smells frÂ«tn a Ik-Id of wild j
flowers. The bracing Â»nd brain-creating

nificent peanuts of the sea, it is your pro
pinquity that insures the superiority of
the seaside brain to that of the person who
shrivels under heat where salt breezes do

For 5 cents the prince of a day could
have the choice of any of these dishes,
â with bread and beer. There was no grudg
ing about it. The "barkeep" had no
sooner drawn the beer than he briskly in
quired, "What will you eat?" There was
a marplot in the place, a man who sug
gested sordid considerations to the man
behind the bar and lunch-counter, hinting
that beggary lies this way and ' that in
solvency must chase by night and day the
man who would give 5-cent meals with
steam beer thrown in. On him were bent
sinister looks and the general .verdict was
that lie should be claimed by th*" sea, with
all its wealth of luscious food full in sight,
and be forced to dine, sup and breakfast
upon starveling smoked herring â as red
and smoky, salt and bony as Dossible. V
- I must explain here that I ate the frank
furters because I knew that economy made
it necessary to have something that would
stand by me for some hours and stand
any hints of hunger. . '
. It was early in :, the day to start for the
park and the Cliff. The bonton would
not come out until later.' There was
enough to do in the meantime. Two or
three preliminary preparations for burst
ing into the fashionable throng at the
park on terms of equal footing were neces
sary. There were spots on the reportorial
shoes; the reportorial face needed a razor;
the indispensable boutonmere must be
procured. The shave could be secured
free. The boutonniere might come easily,
but how about a shine? The presence of
sufficient blacking on the shoe-leather
was evident. Oh, for a brush for a minute
free!
"Sire," said Napoleon when he Â»con
templated and discussed a winter : foray
over the mountains into Italy, "sire, there
shall be no Alps." " '
I was not Napoleon, but Italy, by a
rocky road, was nevertheless my destina
tion. The problem was to swoop down,
so to speak, upon a bootblackery; to seize
a brush and administer ! personally half a
dozen free rubs and to ; get away â¢ free.
Some of ' the Italians have eyes - like
stilettos, their gaze piercing you through.
Others are mild as the skies of their only
lovely native land of song and vine. Be
fore a drowsy Italian knew what had hap
pened I bad a brush and was dusting the
reportorial hat. It was a shoe-brush and
the Italian said hospitably, "Taka disa
brusha." Fatal amiability. The prince
of a day had sized him up correctly. With
lightning speed the shoe-brush whisked
over bis shoes, and they shone like a drum

barber school which is on Howard street
near Eleventh. Not even a prince for a
day would derogate from his dignity by
accepting a favor where he was not able to
confer one of eaual size in return. Scis
sors snip and razors meander endlessly
over cheeks without a fee. Young men
and old men and at least one young
woman have become students in an
! eight weeks' course in the barber school.
j With a towel tucked under my chin
and lathered tor the coming event, I
kept ruy shiny shoes carefully out of the
reach of anything that could injure iheir
gloss, and soon emerged with a face more
beautiful and princely than ever. On my
Hyperion-like locks had been deposited
sweet scents. This being i.ear the Lick
free baths a visit was paid to that e.-tub
lishment. As a stranger an invitation was
extended to bathe freely and without price
by a genial attendant, who dispenses
towels and generally superintends. This
invitation would have been accepted but
for the shine and the hair dressing. This
was bad generalship and unworthy of a
"man who aspired to emulate Napoleon,
' but the retreat was masterly as it was ac
companied by an invitation to "call
again."
It was barely 11 o'clock, too early still for
the bonton.
Standing on pedestals, with outstretched
paws, two large bears guard the portals of
the museum of the California Academy of
Sciences. Passing along a marble floor
and over palatial stairways, the prince of
a day allowed his haughty eyes to dwell
with cold, unrelenting and scientific
cynicism upon the huge but counterfeit
mammoth which stands pre-eminent
among a bevy of articulated prehistorics.
But soon the delights of contemplation
came surging across the reportorial mind
like racing scons. Once more the earth in
fancy became tne battle-ground of huge
amphibians, wallowing in fear or shak
ing their arena witb their ponderous
tread. Huge winged serpents with ser
rated teeth shot horribly across the
sky. Lizards came to \he one thou
sandth anniversary of the birthday
of the equanodon, and the honors of the
day were divided between the pterodactyl
and the ichthyosaurus. The behemoth,
"that sweated blood," shrieked with
all the vigor of prehistoric lungs of
leather. Here in a glass case the dreaded
python writhes. There the egg of the
Mississippianis contains dull possibilities
of producing an Easter alligator. There
was no reporter's "detail" connected with
this; no danger of a "scoop"; no story to
be extracted. The post-pliocene and plio
cene periods might become inextricably
mixed and no one could be held responsi
ble. This show could be viewed with the
free spirit which belongs to the ordinary
mortal; getting more intense joy because
the big animals are as big as the laws of
nature permit and because their names
are mostly unpronounceable.
There was the State Bureau of Mining
standing open with free and inviting as
pect. In a glass case is the umbrella
which was once owned by Benjamin
Franklin. It is a vivid blue color as to
cloth. The stick is stout as a truncheon
and terminates in a ferrule of brass. While
there could be only grief in an American
mind that Benjamin Franklin could not
Transportation to and from the park was
a serious matter. Although only one
nickel bad been taken from the treasury the
units which go toward making up a
quaner of a dollar, one dime and two nick
els, clinked insignificantly in my pockets
as if they knew that they were very small
fry and were twitting each other on that
humiliating fact.
When the prince of a day boarded a
streetcar it was with the idea of having a
long ride for a nickel â not the longest In
the town, but as long as was compatible
with the plans of the day and the time re
maining in which they could be carried
out. Lotta's fountain was settled as
the point of departure. The first
car that came along would do
and from a front seat the moving spectacle
of Market street was enjoyed. After rid
ing some blocks westward a transfer was
taken to Powell street and a northward
course wa3 pursued. Then the second
transfer took the nickel tourist out over
the Jackson-street line, from which there
were line views of the Golden Gate and
handsome residences and grounds which,
as they were passed, stimulated a sense of
aristocratic enjoyment. Central avenue
caused the issuance of a third transter
and the beginning of a fourth ride for a
nickel. The itinerary had included a tour
westward, a second tour northward, a
thira tour westward and southward, and
now, for the same nickel, the fourth tour,
westward and still further southward to
Golden Gate Park was taken.
Oa these four trips two pieces of good
luck came along which could not be thrown
away. The h'rst waa tne capture of a
morning paper which was lelt by a pas
senger. The second was the acquisition
of the coveted boutonniere. Information
from the paper, strategically volunteered,
led to a conversation with a family party
bound for the park, the conversation being
based on mv admiration for pinks, of
which one of the young persons bad a
bunch. Would I accept a boutonniere?
Why, certainly, with pleasure. The news
paper was a gold mine, for it was subse
quently aold, after some brazen use of
lung, for a nickel to a party from the coun
try who wanted to look up a time table.
That nickel secured a glass of beer and a
free lunch near the park, but that lunch
was so poor that the less said about it the
better.
The greatest conservatory on the Pacific
Coast, namely, the one in Golden Gate
Park, was made to furnish its quota of
entertainment. A cigar would have en
hanced the joy of this part of the day, but
that was denied and this is the only re- ]
membered deprivation. In the conserva- !
tory the eyes are regaled with the choicest (
vegetation. The humid air is like the
tropics, and its fostering influence causes
the plants in its soil to burgeon forth '
bravely in a bewildering opulence of
graceful Sowers and rainbow-hued petals
and fronds. The orchids reveal their sin
gular habits and charm the eye. Clamber
ing vines decorate their graceful foliage i
with gaudy blossoms. By the time the
edge has worn off this pleasure the aviary
calls for a visit and the buffalo paddoclc
invites. The birds sing beautifully, the
squirrels gracefully antic, the inhabitants
of the paddock charm and there are three
nickels still in the treasury, these incur
sions into botany, floriculture and zoology
not having cost a cent. Three shows in
one, added to four separate rides and the '
other diversions of the day and the best
was yet to come.
Travelers tell of the gay sights on "TJn
ter den Linden," the Bois de Boulogne,
Fifth avenue, Commonwealth avenue and
famous boulevards where wealth and fash
ion congregate in dress parade. Taking a
comfortable bench under a shady tree, I
took in the fashion and gayety of all the i
"nobby" people in San Francisco, to which \
was added the tourists from all climes. A
gay cavalcade speeds between the banks of j
living green, upon which are drifts of
flowers. The wheels flash as they merrily
whirl. The voices of the riders of horses
and bicycles are raised in gay laughter
ana genuine glee. The wind rustles de
liciously through the trees, but there is
lacking still the flavor and odor of a good
cigar. Fifteen cents would take the tour
ist down on the cars and give him v
dinner of three courses on Kearny street â
soup, meat and dessert â the course dinner
costing 10 cents and the ride a uickel.
A vaunt, course dinner! Better the fra
grant weed and the satisfying 5-cent coffee
and cake than the pampered appetite of
three courses which shall cause this other
wise perfect scene of present bliss to be
marred. It is then a tournamentâ at dice.
A lucky tnrow that, and the prince of a
day has a cigar and still retains the entire
15 cents.
If before the scene was blissful it is now
Elysian or Nirvana like. The benches in
the park are no more hard. The trees
whisper more softly to each other as they
interchange jocular confidences and leafy
quips. The sun dial truly "tells only the
sunny hours." The women seem more
beautiful aud chic. The bicyclists speed
along with dream-like ease and insub
stantiableness. Every flower in the park
area diffuses a sweeter and subtler breath.
The park police would be excused for as
suming suddenly a heroic pose as riders
ot Bucephalus. The afternoon passes all j
too fast on golden wings. The sweet cool
ness that follows sunset, the sky being
Jaced with purple and gold, is delicious.
From the sward rises tlie steam
of new - mown hay. The horses'
hoofs rattle like castanets on the
hard road. Over the steep Bides of |
Tamalpais, as the prince of a day climbs |
the stairs leading upward toward the north
side of the park, there is a purple shadow,
a deep robe of royal purple, in wliich early
stars soon begin to glisten like jewels. But
the glory of the mountain is also only for
a day, and at once a bond of sympathy
exists between the prince and the royal
mountain.
There will be no evening cigar, but there
is a course dinner ahead and a conce rt
The course dinner is not bad. It consists j
of soup, roast beef and pudding, with
coffee. Now comes the last event of the
day. After the evening papers have been j
readâ freeâ tne steps of r eople are wending \
inward from Market street to the Em- ;
porium. Therein, perched on an elevated
music-stand, are the orchestra. They play
music by Mercadante, Rossini, Weber,
Verdi, and so on. The cadence rises and
falls. The prince drinks it all in. Penni
less as be is he feels that he "dwells in
marble halls," and the marble all about
him assists the illusion. Truly, 1 have
been a prince for a day in San Francisco
on two- bits. There are no to-morrows.

Interpenetration of Solids.
Some Startling possibilities of tke Firxer
Forces of |Jat\jre.
This is the age of invention and discov
ery. Professor Crookes of England, the
greatest chemist of the world, some years
ago invented a peculiar tube which has
j lately come into general use through the
X (or unknown) ray. Canaille Flam
marion, the great French astronomer, hae
demonstrated the probability of human
life in tbe planet Ma s. Both of these
scientists assert that what is referred to as
''the fourth dimension of space" is an ac
| tual fact in nature, and that in addition to
length, breadth and thickness, matter may
possess a fourth dimension. Eminent -as
these gentlemen are in their respective
professions their belief in "the new dimen
sion" has been received with ?reat incred
ulity, and it is only within the past few
months that even the faintest show of
respect has been extended by the world
for their belief in this direction.
What is the fourth dimension? How
| can there possibly be a measurement be
â  sides length, breadth and thickness? In
reality there is not. But there is a prop
j erty or quality of matter which at first was
! thought to be equivalent to a new dimen
sion, and for convenience these scientists
employed the word "dimension" when
referring to it. The newly discovered
quality of matter ranks in importance
next to lengtb, thickness and breadth. It
is "permeability." It has been discovered
that two solid bodies may exist in the
l same place at once; that solid matter can
, pass through solid matter without the
slightest injury to either object.
It is through the X ray that tbe first
great public demonstration of this law is
made. It is a scientific axiom that no
two molecules of matter really touch each
other, but each is surrounded by an inter
space of ether. All molecules are known
to be in constant motion, the rate
of vibration varying according to tbe
texture and density of the substance of
which they are parts. Now, when the
X ray 1* employed on an object, it fur
nishes so powerful a light that it illum
inates these elheric interspaces, and the
molecules themselves being so innnitesi
xn.illy fcmall, and in constant motion, they
offer little or no resistance to the illumina
tion, hence under proper conditions it has
been proven that the human eye can see
all through a solid mass of matter, through
iron plates, stone walls and human bodies,
with about the same degree of clearness
that it sees through the atmosphere.
Two distinct inventions or discoveries
lie ahead in this direction. The first is
to scientifically prove that gross matter
can pass tnrough gross matter; the sec
i ond, to project the human body through
solid substances. Both these feats may
be pronounced impossible; and even where
one admits them for the sake of argument
he in apt to claim that there could be no
radical difference in the two operations
and that one discovery would include the
other. But this is not so. The first dis
covery will be made long before the sec
ond can be demonstrated to the satisfac
tion of science.
Actually, both of these feats have been
accomplished by hundreds of investigators
of the finer forces of nature, but as they
have considered such thines as of very
small importance compared with what
they were searching for, they hayÂ© rarely
taken the trouble to say anything about
the ''incidental" feats they performed.
They Dave also acquired the ability to see
through solid matter by using the X-ray
of the body,Â«nd to these investigators the
invention of Koentgen appears a very
clumsy affair.
I will giv.- Western materialistic societies
a clew if they wish to explore this new
realm. It is merely a hint, but if some of
them take the trouble to follow it up they
may become more widely known than
Edison or Tesla. Starting with the known
fact that all molecules are in a state of
rapid vibration, under certain laws of co
hesion, each molecule keeping entirely
separate from all others and each being
surrounded by an atmosphere of ether, as is
now demonstrated by the X ray, it follows
that if we could procure a point suffi
ciently tine it could be inserted into the
interspace between the molecules. The
interspaces have a greater breadth than
the molecules. Taking two objects of the
same composition, iron, for instance, the
one can be passed through the other, if
we can once succeed in getting the mole
cules of one piece to exactly join with the
interspaces of the other.
There are certain laws of rhythm which
govern the constant inclination in all
grades of matter., and when one is once
able to learn the harmonic action and in
teraction by which the molecules play
back and forth he has the problem half
solved and has next to acquaint himself
with the peculiar quality of force which
must be applied in order to compel the
atoms of different objects to interpenetrate
each other. It is enough at present to say
that this force is electrical in its nature
and that when applied in a certain way the
scientist will be able to pass wood through
iron, brass through marble and iron
through glass without the least fear of
damage.
The next result referred to in connection
with the new quality of matter is the pos
sibility of living men passing through
solid walls, no matter of what kind of ma
terial composed, or of descending through
the solid crust of the earth, with less in
convenier.ee than the diver sinks to the
bottom of the sea.
This will ba accomplished in an entirely
different manner from the method first
described. In that case there was an in
terpenetration of molecules. But in the
case of the human body the molecules are
knit around with such an intricate net
j work of nadis (minute nerves) arid vital
I essences that should there be a penetra
! tion of gross substance through them it
j would result in death or dangerous injury.
There are, of course, certain loci in the
body at which there are invisible open
ings in which one may jab himself with a
dagger without any real injuryâ provided
he knows bow, but speaking of the body
as a whole it is not safe to disarrange its
molecular arrangement. In order to
transport the body through solid sub
stances one must entirely discompose
those molecules which his body contacts,
and then build them up again after he has
passed through. This is accomplished by
a knowledge of electrical forces; and the
displacing and replacing of the molecules
can be accomplished with the rapidity of
thought. An instance of this operation
was given in The Call of June 7, in its
article on Magician Tautriadelta, where
the latter described an African who floated
through the walls of abut and back again,
the walls remaining intact.
The fourth; dimension of space then,
while it concerns, the interior of matter, is
not a dimension in reality, but it has to do
with a quality or ; property of matter
permanently â which is entirely unknown
to western science, though in my own
countryâ lndiaâ it is a matter of general
knowledge, and was also known to a num
ber of the mystic philosophers of Europe.
In India it is a common matter for the
traveling fakirs to give performances in
which they thrust their hands through
solid doors, put books through books,
enter houses with only one door and pass
out through the wall on the other side.
Many fakirs of comparatively little power
are able to do these things. They possess
enormous^will power, and having gained a
knowledge of some of the subtle essences
of nature, they are able to perform feats
which seem miraculous to the uninitiated.
But the higher class of fakirs or yoeis
never appear in public, and are said to
possess knowledge as far in advance of the
average fakir as the fakir is ahead of tbe
American scientist in this line.
It is said by some of the Eastern seers
I that America is to make some treat dis
coveries regarding the "fourth dimension
of space" during the coming century, and
perhaps after a few years the above will
not sound as strange as it does to-day.

I wifch I were something else than a
woman â not a man thougn. I am like
Topsy.
That standing up in a car, now. Why
shouldn't she? She claims and proves
her claims to strength, and why should
skirts make a man give up his seat to her,
except in cases where he would do the
same for another man?
I never want a man to give me bis place
in a car or elsewhere. I have no right to
it. There is nothing makes me feel my
downtrodden condition so keenly as to be
compelled to take the place of some old
gentleman not one-half as able to stand,
but whose old-school politeness makes it
impossible for nim to sit while one of the
"fair sex" stands.
When a woman with a baby comes in
every one, man and woman alike, is in
duty bound to rise and insstupon making
her comfortable. We are not giving place
to the woman, but to the mother and child.
We would do the same for a man with a
like burden, or we would offer to hold the
baby. The weary woman with seven
bundles and a trail of children like a flight
of stepsâ well, she has no real right to my
seat or my brother's, but I would give her
mine gladly.
I am so glad not to be in her place that
I would stand half a day just for the pleas
ure of seeing her for once at rest.
The woman with a crutch or a cane it is
needless to mention.
California men stumble over each other
to help her, aud the tired conductor's
cross face grows all
gentleness again. I I
think nowhere are all I
classes more tender I
to bodily affliction I
than in our home I
city.
The old lady with I
the snowy puffs and I
the placid far look in I
her eyes, as if she I
had passed all the I
puzzles of life and I
could see something I
beyond, is willing to I
stand, and protests I
with her gentle hand I
and soft voice against I
putting you to any I
inconvenience. You I
would no more sit I
and see her swaying I
from a strap â why I
you feel like standing I
in her presence any- I
way.
There is often a pc- I
- culiar look in a girl's I
eye when she has to I
stand that, were I a I
man, would effectu- I
ally put to flight any I
cbivalric purpose. It I
is the same because- I
I-ani-a-woman looic I I
have spoken of be- I
fore. I notice that I
girl usually stands I
unless there is an old I
man in the car, and I
in my secret heart I I
rejoice.
Then there is the I
comfortably circum- I
stanced shopper, on I
her way home just at I
the season when I
workingmen are fill- I
ing the car. She not I
only has no right to I
expect one of these I
men to give up his I
place to her, but she I
has no right to accept I
it if it be offered.
Maybe she is fatigued from her after
noon's standing and choosing; perhaps
thÂ« thought of jolting along fifteen
or twenty minutes hanging to a
strap is not a pleasant one. Justice is
justice, and you know how often we quote
of late that God created all of us free and
equal. That shabby man with a tin pail
between his feel is tired too; he was first
in the car, paid for his place and has a
right to it.
The woman with a dog in her arms has
no right to a seat, even when no one else
wants it.
Ido not like to stand in a car. I do not
enjoy Bitting in one, either. If I cannot
sit on the outside I like to stand there, and
often I would rather stand than sit. Be
cause of the bad habits of my sex I have
to explain this laboriously every time I
stand.
The other evening going out Butter street
after a long day's work sitting in one cnair
my heart beat high with hope. The car
was jammed. The only possible place for
me was standing-room on the front plat
form with two men. What a good breath
of damp air I would get, how my tired
back would relax and how hungry I would
be.
Bat I had forgotten who I was. The
conductor came as quickly as he could,
and with ft glance through -the door he
said, "I will matte room for you to stand
inside, Miss."
"Oh. don't," I pleaded; "it is soÂ«tuÃy.
I would rather stand here."
"You are quite right," spoke np one of
the men; "the air in there is enough to
kill."
So I escaped for the time. [N. B. Should
I have been offended at the man's speech?]
At the next corner two women got off.
Two men went to sit down. "Lady on
the platform !" announced tbÂ« conductor,
and one man hung himself up again. The
lady on the platform looked away with a
stony face, buc no use. The polite man ol
fares was bound to do his duty. "Room
inside, Miss."
"I would rather stay out here if you do
not mind."
I think 1 must have gone In willy-nilly,
only a man got off the dummy and waved
me to his place. Seeing that the earth was
disturbed and the heavens shaken by rea
son of my obstinacy, I sat. I didn't have
any right to the place, and I didn't want it
The most enjoyable ride I ever took (on
a car) was across the bay going to Blair
Park. It is a fine ride anyway, through
fields and over hills, and I got on a car
full of women and children. There was
no one to say me nay, ao man to give me
what was not ray right, and I bad to stand
on tbe step with one arm around a post.
The car swayed and flew, ray skirt caught
a picturesque border of thistledown and
foxtail, my cheeks tingled in the wind, it
was glorious.
I know all would not like a rid? of tbe
kind; still, if you object to thistles in your
dress, think of tbe anguish that is wring
ing the heart of tbe polite young man as
the foxtail enters his soul by way of his
dearest Sunday trousers.
While I am preaching about cars, there
is a secondly, my sisters. How many peo
ple is one woman equal to? If we are each
equal to one, we have no right to more
space than one would naturally occupy.
Big sleeves are lovely. We all dread the
day when fashion shall decree that our
arms shall look like sausages, and it does
hurt to have them crushed, to come out of
a crowd with our pride flat. Is it the
crowd's fault?
No, ma'am. You and I have each tbe
right to one woman's room and no more.
If, with bie sleeves and voluminous skirts
we take the space of three, we must be
good naturea when we find ourselves flat
tened sidewise to cnr natural width.
Did you ever notice the glare of displeas
ure as a man settles into what he thinks
is an empty seat between two ladies? The
seat is vacant, to be sure, but as each
shoulder of the man touches that next to
him, cr-ra-ack goes fiber chamois, like tbe
sack in which Little Claus kept his con-
I juror.
The man looks embarrassed or annoyed,
while tbe owners of the pneumatic sleeves
send lightning from both sides. Ii is
funny. They have no right to the extra
space, and he has.
Tbe same if tne folds of the full and
heavy skirts billow out over tho floor and
tne last passenger takes bis stand thereon.
If I were he I'd delight to walk all over
itâ with nails in my shoes.
JWO STRIKI^Q PORTRAITS,
Leaving the car and following the sleeves
and the skirt of many yards to their desti
nation, we see them still usurpers, taking
other folks' ground and other folks' view
with a coolness tbat belongs everywhere
to pure selfishness.
In the theater the prospect of silk and
the topping of feathers may be very won
derful to the little man sitting behind, but
it is not what he paid to see.
Nowhere and never can one garment
cause agony to so many people as a full
skirt going'downstairs with a crowd.
Now doesn't that bring to you a picture
of an unconscious madam, dignity in every
movement, sweeping down the stairs with
yards and yards and yards of good strong
cloth wiping the dust from three, no, four
steps, ruÂ«tling now to one side and then
the otber, while a nearly frantic man
comes after, pushed from behind, and with
almost superhuman effort trying to keep
off the grass?
He steps gingerly down, pushing the
mass with his toe to make room for his
footâ one step; her majesty sweeps on, tbe
billows fall and leave a space clear â two
steps; she steps again, the skirt starts, the
man starts, and the woman pauses to nod
to one, in tbe crowd ; the skirt pauses too, \
and tbe man is standing on it with tears
of distress in his eyes; be hops to one side,
treading on three different feet, bringing
down as many anathemas on his unlucky
headâ three steps; the skirt moves onâ
four steps; in his dizzy eyes the mass of
cloth is a hideous mass of snakes and they
are drawing him with resistless power to
tread on them and die; the people behind
push, and a voice whose owner sees tbe
space ahead grumbles that there is plenty
of room for him to go on, and they press
harder- five steps. Alas, alas, the eddy
ing billows ahead and the pushing crowd
behind are too much ! At the sixth step
he goes plump with both feet on the skirt
just as madam takes a step. There is a
tearing sound that seema to him the crack
of doom, he sees a pair of angry eyes,
hears a sharp voice call him awkward and
stupid, stammers ana apologizes, and is so
glad to get out into tbe darkness and lay
his hot bead against a lamppost.
The woman nad no right to more than
one step.
I have walked downstairs, my skirts
hÂ«id closeâ it is easy enoughâ and pushed
before ma all tbe way another woman's
flowing garment. If my shoes were muddy
I suppose I was sorry.
Once I was coming down tbe boat steps
with a man who thinks It a disgrace to be
brusque to a woman. He patiently kept
j off Â« skirt, until at last he turned to me
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 12, 18JJ6.
with a question, put
his foot on the cloth
and tore a piece out.
He started for the
owner to apologize. I
could not stand it.
With my hand on
bis arm I expostulat
ed. "Don't you ex
cuse yourself ! Don't
dare to apologize!
She owes you an apol
ogy instead ! She bad
no rieht to the whole
Stairway! "Thewom
an turned, heard and saw. She came
back and begged pardon. I forgave her.
There is one right which is no right oar
sisters are fond o( takingâ "keeping a seat
for my friend."
In a crowded hall where no seats are re
served, where often they are not even
paid for, my lady will calmly put her fan
in the next chair and for an hour tell the
people, men ana woman who have a right
to that chair, that she Is keeping it for a
friend. And sbe insists upon keeping it,
too, turning a deaf ear and a blank face
upon demands for the seat and remarks
about her right to it. When "my iriend"
comes sbe rustles into the empty place
with an air of proprietorship most enlac
ing â if you are not the one defrauded of
tbe seat. If 1 were an artist I would draw
that woman in the likeness of a nice clean
Pig-
I saw her last week biackmail a man out
of his chair in a way wonderful to see.
Her friend came up to her, late as usual,
and she said : "I tried to keep your seat,
dear, but this gentleman took it and I
didn't like to asK him to eive it up. I'm
so sorry you have to stand."
The man left his chair and stood by me,
soliloquizing, and I said for him to hear,
"Tbe selfish you have with you always."
I felt sorry that tne man should have
brought home to him so forcibly the weak
side of my sisters, and was glad when, an
hour later, a black glove was laid on mine,
and a quiet voice said, "Now, yon take
this chair for tne rest of the time and let <
OJME OF WOMAN'S piQHTS TH/\J jvtyW BE WJ*OJ^q.
me stand." I took the little stranger's
place, glancing to see if the ousted man
saw the other side. He did.
We have no right to go to a place where
people have assembled to hear a certain
thing and regale those aoout us with pri
vate affairs.
I went once to bear Congressman Maguire
talÃ single-tax. Like the man who aston
ished the Circumlocution Oflice, I wanted
to know, you know. I didn't know more
about single-tax after, but such charming
tales I heard of the last illness of tbe
woman behind me.
And, lastly, of my younger sisters,
They, too, take more than belongs to them.
The schoolgirl tyrannizes over a male
teacher in a way tbat is pitiless. She
does and says what he would never en
dure from a boy, and does it with con
scious impunity because sbe is a girl. If
once in a way a teacher lets discipline
overrule sex consideration what a wail
arises! The brute! to punish a girl.
Why, a girl without doing enough to
bang a complaint on can nag the life
nearly out of a teacher. I have pitied a
young instructor, only a boy himself, in
the tolls of a cruel girl. I have said to
him, "If you show her. she is subject to
tbe same laws and the same penalties as
her brother she will cease."
I don't exactly like to tell the rest of it
He took my advice and lost his position.
They said, *'Of course, if it had been a boy
it would have different." There is no .-uch
and "of course."
The average girl on a wheel takes her
share of tbe road and as much more as she
wants. Sbe expects the boys to keep from
getting in her way and to keep from getting
where she will be in their way. I know.
I beard a man's opinion of me when I
nearly ran him down before I learned to
manage my wheel and I said to myself,
'â¢My friend, them's my sentiments, too,
and- next time I'll keep to my aide of the
road if I take off the panel of a fence."
I did want to speak of the right of a girl
to do a man's work and do it well for less
than enough to buy her clothes and food,
but tbat will make another story.

Wild
Leap of a
Darirvg Wheelman
A few nights ago the chains which held !
the Piedmont to the pier in San Francisco j
had been released with the customary
clank, the deck bands had pushed up the
apron attached to the pier which bridges
the gap between the pier and the boat's i
deck, tbe signal had been given for the \
wheels to revolve and already the paddles
were churning 'up tbe water under the
boat into a resemblance to soapsuds; the
thrill of movement waÂ» already ex
perienced and tbe people who habitually
frequent the lower deck while crossing the I
bay were amusing themselves in customary
fashion, smoking, gossiping and preparing
to sniff the cool air as soon as the boat
passed out beyond the piles and into the
ship channel.
Suddenly there came into view a start
ling apparition. Down the wharf, clad in
sweaters and bicycle garb, sped an impet- j
uous wheelman straight for the fleeing
boat. The spokes of bis bicycle wheels
were invisible. His feet went up and
down with regularity and great speed. At
once there was a feeling of apprehension
on tbe ferry-boat, and warning shouts in
stinctively were uttered. The scorcher
paused not nor hesitated. The boat was
moving, but the bicycle easily outclassed
it by many degrees as a racer. Just as the
clear water was about to srlow between the
edge of the apron and the deck of the
ferry-boat the bicycler leaped from his i
bicycle with the speed of thought, seized J
the machine and boldly jumped toward I
tbe boat. He was cool as well as nervy, |
and his wheel was not permitted to strike !
the deck with a perceptible jar. Then the '
men breathed easier and women specta- '
tors laughed hysterically. The bold rider j
took a fearful chance. 1

the Cliff-DWellers
A group of Eastern tourists dropped in
yesWday at the museum of tbe California
Academy of Sciences and were soon aeeply
engrossed in contemplation of the minia
ture reproduction of the homes of the cliff
dwellers of Arizona, New Mexico and
Colorado. The scientific method adopted
to bring up these scenes of antiquity is
the plaque plan, the wails, battlements,
precipitous cliffs, etc., appearing thereon in
relief. The scale being largely reduced, it is
possible that the overhanging cliffs which
menace the roofs and heads of the sup
posable ancients are a little too beetling
and the cliffs are a trifle too lofty and pre
cipitous and inaccessible.
"Ab," sighed a very engaging young
lady, "how could any one ever live up
there now?"
'Suppose so see hole; that forketchum
inside," said a Mongolian bystander.
"Window, you mean," interrupted the
fair Easterner. "Do 1 understand you
that these interesting people climbed in at
the windows?"
"All samee climb in at window. Man
ho walkum heap hard until be climp up,
four, tive thousand feet."
"Yes, and then?"
"He lookum see heap high; he
fallum down into soup â what you call
him?"
'â¢Soup? Oh, yes, I understand. The
aboriginal fell into tbe soup. How in
teresting."
"S'pose he not walkum. Then man at
top he haulum. He go up, up, all same
like Chicago house â heap way up."
"Did you ever see the cliff dwellings?"
This question was asked with fine Bos
tonian irony.
"No," admitted the Chinaman who
knows it all. "No, but I lived three
months at Chicago and I eavey Chicago
all tanie."

exquisite portrait of a little i girl, Miss

esting â tbe above-mentioned loan collec
tion at Cr.m] den House, a collection of
the drawings and studies of Sir Edward
Burne-Jones, and a collection of drawings
"illustrating society," as tbe catalogue
modestly informs us, by Mr. Charles Dana
Gibson.
Campden House is one of the big old
fashioned mansions of Kensington; the
great garden surrounding it, the shaded
walk leading to it, make it rather impos
ing; but it is not better adapted for bang
ing pictures than tbe Hopkins house
itself. It is not only necessary to be able
to see pictures by walking around them ;
it is a pleasure to be able to see them at
their best. Tbat is possible only in a
well-ordered gallery or in a studio.
Over tbe inner doorway of the entrance
ball the little "Strawberry Girl," by Sir
Joshua Reynolds, bad been executed. It
was possible to see tbe big eyes under the
nnchildish turban, tho little hands crossed
one over the otber and tbe general dark
richness of the color â but the actual color
itself was as invisible as the strawberries,
for which latter fact the absence of light
and tbe hanging were not responsible.
Two portraits â one of Mrs. Hickey, one
of Charles James Foxâ were not very in
teresting.
The Romney portrait of Mrs. Glyn made
me long for the old fashions of powdered
hair and folded kercbiets, and the clear,
almost childlike expression of tbe faces of
tbe women of that period.
Romney's portraits have retained a won
derful purity of colorâ the liquid blue of
tbe eyes, the touch of crimson on the lipa
have almost tbe freshness of wet paint â
and who better than Romney could paint
a head at once spirited and delicate?
Tbe grayish nair tbat is blonde under
the, powder, tbe transparent white of the
kerchief â tbe melting color of flesh in
light, against light, with light all around
it "receive the assurance of our most
distinguished respect," George Romney.
"The Mushroom Picker" and a small
"Full Length Figure of a Girl" represent
Gainsboroughâ not too well. "Tbe Mush
room Picker" is interesting technically
because it is untinishedâ it is hardly more
than oegunâ washed in, in a rich dark
brown and a scumble of lighter amber.
Hogarth is responsible for the white*
{ headed, red-coated old reprobate bung in
'the refreshment-room; bis small, blue
I twinkling eyes look down upon bills of
microscopic cakes and transparent sand
wiches â his face is almost apoplectic in
color. Time has been kind to the harsh,
firm color â to the thickly painted red
face â but it must have Deen rather un
pleasantly vivid when the gold frame was
new.
And opposite over the teatable scowls
Prince Rupert by Albert Cuyp. Prince
I Rupert is a formidable gentleman in a red
velvet cap and flaunting feathers â there is
a storm brewing in the landscape bebind
him, and his dark hard face, rather bilious
in color, with bold eyes and a thin line of
cruel mouth under an equally straight
and tbin line of mustacheâ is hardly less
awe inspiring.
The refreshment-room has been more
than honored. In the corner we meet the
cold glance of George Villiers, second
Duke of Buckingham. Reserved, distin
guished, with a long, tine-featured face,
painted in cool gray flesh tones, a great
point lace collar cooler and grayer still,
this portrait has almost the aristocratic
distinction of a Van Dyck. It is by Cor
nelius Van. C. Jansen, who must have been
the contemporary of the great master â bat
C. Van. C. Jansen had more sense of
color than of form. Tbe head is rather
badly out of drawing.
A portrait of Charles Edward by Allen
Ramsey shows a young man with a smil

head seems to be turned almost to tbe
back of his neck and his shoulders are
shrugged only on one side.

following the interested visitor even to the |
remotest corner of the room.
The modern men are here as well. Lord
Leigbton's Flaming June, Electra mourn
ing at the tomb of Agamemnon. The
music of the sea, the dignified, careful
work of the late president of the Royal
Academy. Hi? successor has sent, in
piace of the "Flaming June," which was
only exhibited for two days, a portrait of
a child called "The Deserted Cage." Sir
John Millais is ill and suffering. He is
almost as popular as the late Sir Freder
ick, but when he sends a canvas like "The
Deserted Cage" he almost forfeits sympa
thy. The cage is hardly as vacant as tbe
child's face, and is certainly drawn with
more interest.
The cheap popularity of the subject is
the touch too much. Let us turn to the
"Gambler's Wife," whicn is an old canvas,
but which has lost nothing of its careful,
if rather sweet, coloring and composition.
The landscape by Sir John Millais is
called "The Old Garden," a very clean old
garden, with a weather-stained cupid
blowing a horn on the back of an ani
mated dolphin with the fine silver jet of a
fountain tossed up from bis great jaws. !
The garden bas smooth walks and clipped |
trees and hedges, and is just such an old,
sheltered, sunny place as we may wander
into any day, if we are fortunate, even in
smoky London.
Watts is represented by several portraits.
There are two beautiful dark landscapes
by tbe late Henry Moore. Alfred Parsons
has his rather conventional blooming fruit
trees against a windy sky; tbere is a
Frank Hall, and two jolly Sir David
Wilkies, "A Peddler Showing His Wares,"
and "'The Penny Wedding," from the
j Queen's collection. Tbere is a David
I Teniers, even a Muriilo. But it is impossi
ble to stay away from the portraits at the
end of tbe middle room, with the light
streaming in between them, and the glass
which protects them giving maddening
reflections of all tbe other pictures one
does not care to see, and of all the people
in bright dresses, who might be more
profitably employed in tbe daily passing
show in Hyde Park.
It is hardly in an amiable spirit that we
pause before the Whistlers; it is in uncon
trollable bad temper that we regard the
great canvas of Luke Fildes, the anxious
doctor looking into the white face of the
sick child, upon whom the rather theatri
cal lamplight is turned. In justice to the
big emotional picture that occupies the
place of honor, it is well conceived, well
drawn and well painted, soberly and hon
estly. Tbe mother who has her head
buried, in her arms, the father standing at
â  her side nth a con-

Band uses it to the

I pacity.
And iere at the
end of tie loom the
little girl stands, very erect sad tery self
possessed, in a rather sUtelj, if entirely
childlike, dignity. And the Siul of every
painter beats almost audibly as he regards
it. If it be not treason I wood suggest
that Miss Cicely Alexander coad be hung
next to the Infanta Margheria, in the
Louvre, and the masterpiece of 3an Diego
di Velasquez would not seem more re
markable.
Some one has recently wriiten that
Whistler's art is the quintessence of all
that the nineteenth ceniury has t> offer to
the artistic gourmet. He has takei to him
self the best of every art with w-iich his
subtle and delicate fancy has b*en mo
mentarily impressed. In bis yoith the
mysterious charm of the creations of
Dante Gabriel Rossetti surrounded him;
something of their still, deep clanct is ia
the eyes of all of Whistler's womeft and
children.
Impressionism as it was first understood
taught him the lesson of surrounding his
figures with air, of bringing them forward
out of cool depths of background by atten
tion to the form and modeling of the points
where lights and shadows meet. From
Velasquez himself he gained his beautiful
great lines, the simple solid backgrounds,
the lovely silver-gray tone, and from the
Japanese, at last, he took the understand
ing of great flat manses of color, the dec
orative arrangement and the wonderful
attention to detail, which maicea every
jar, every flower he adds to his composi
tion absolutely necessary to its perfect
harmony.
Whistler's powerful tongue is a weapon
to be feared and his whole scorn is di
dicted against the realists, whose creed is
contained in the single rule that nature
cannot err, that everything, in nature is
tit subject for the art of the painter, that
to make a servile copy of the model, not
closing an eye to one unpleasant or inhar
monious touch, is the beginning and the
end of the first and
the last lesson.

The portrait of lit-
I tie Miss Alexander,
I done long ago, was
I one of his first and
I most striking sue-
I cesses. After his first
I picture had been re-
I fused at the Salon
I (tnat wonderful
woman in white
, which made the Sa
lon dcs Refuses of 1863 a conspicuous
and distinguished exhibition) Whistler
settled in London and very soon after the
present portrait was painted.
Miss Cicely Alexander makes us thine
of the little Spanish princesses. It is per
haps the dress, which is of white muslin,
with wide sleeves and a skirt that bangs
out in crisp stiffness like the skirts of a
ballet dancer. The child has a large gray
hat in her hand, with a black ribbon and a
floating feather. With white and black and
gray, and a tone hardly warmer over the
siiver-blonde hair and the soft little lumi
nous face, with the big eyes ar.d the one
touch of crimson on the lips, everything
that could be said has been said.
Did Whistler give or had the child
really all that soft dignity, that mixture
of reserve and graciousness, that fine
j flower of an appealing, shy reserve that is
as intangible as a fragrance? Toe delicacy
of extreme youth rests upon the little
fiaureas lightly as the two butterflies of
pale gold that have fluttered into the
[ background, or the gold-hearted daisies
that tremble in the shadow behind her.
! On the opposite wall, equally badJy hnne,
, hangs the older sister, not quite so delight-
I ful and equally indescribable.
A young girl in black, that is not dead,
that is not shadow, that is a clear, fresh,
soft light-black; the bead pointed low in
tone; around the neck a bit of transparent
white crushed muslin. Shi is buttoning
her gloves and looking outof the canvas!
In the background, the which is of yellow
ish-gray, there is a dark far, and a flatter
of tiny vivid yellow flowed. In both por
traits even the signature teems indispensa
ble, that characteristic buiterfly caught on
the wheel.
The nocturne is on* of the dim-blue
evenings, Whistler so l>ved to paint, and
wnich started the rage in painting moon
ligh's and starlights ano twilights as no
body ever before saw tbt>m. It is almost a
heartbreak to think tiat these portraits
are not in a public gfllery, although the
generous frequency wrh which they are
exhibited cannot be oo highly appreci
ated.

Last week she cutH
down the bouse rentM
by letting out a spareM
room to a youngM
woman, who adver-H
tised herself as a pro-H
fessional nurse. On^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
the morning following this transaction a
plainly attired, portly man doffed bis bat
as Mrs. Brown opened the door in response
to the bell.
"Ah," said the stranger, "I read a card
with this address in the morning paper.
Do I address the â " BfJPjP
"Professional nurse? No, sir," and Mrs.
Brown's curiosity prompted the query,"
"What kind of a case is it?"
"Well," replied the man, "it is hardly,
perhaps, what you would term a case, and
yet it mieht be more profitable than most
cases. I'm hunting for somebody to take
care of my two children up in Tuolumne
County."
: "Oh, then, the nurse will not leave the
city ; ana, besides, she is not desirous of
caring for children."
"That's luck!" exclaimed the disap
pointed stranger. "My poor wife breathed
her last three months â then my
housekeeper went Eastâ neighbors
have been keeping my little ones since
then. Of course, lam anxious to make a
more permanent abiding place for them;
but it is hard to get proper attendance in
the country. Money is quite a minor con
sideration in the premises. Why, three of
the best paying mines in Tuolumne are
mine. Blankton of Dashvilleâ l guess
you've seen the name in the papers â that's
me. Business on the stock board makes
me hug San Francisco, and I've half a no
tion to bring the young ones here, too.
Have you any children of your â  own,
madam ?"â '
"Three."
"Well, I see ' you are a â¢ cultured lady.
Would it be possible for - you to ' take my
two little girls as boarders? I'd like it if
they could be brought up like your own.
You certainly would be motherly to them.
I will pay $50 in advance every month for
their board."
Fifty dollars a month It was almost
like rinding something. It was a wind
fall.
â  "Be assured," said the good lady, "if I
look your children I would -beâ â  as kind to
them as to my own. . They would . receive
every consideration, for I would . feel
' toward them thatâ" '*
, "Excuse . me, , ; madam," interrupted Mr.
Blankton, "but I desire .to impress upon'
you that I am not presuming to ask some
thing for nothing. ;If I intrust' ray chil
dren to your care 1 shall not only.pay you
$50 a month for their board, but 1 shall de
posit a sum of money with you in order to

defray whatever little expense may be
necessary on behalf of my daughters from
time to time. I want them to learn music,
too."
"But we have no piano!"
"Very well; they have a costly one and
I shall have it shipped down to you. Our
old home is like a grave to me, and I can
never go back to it." Mr. Blankton
sighed. He must have been devoted to
his wife.
Mrs. Brown wiped away a sympathetic
tear. "Providing we take the children at
the figure you propose and your piano is
brought here, would you object to my
children having the use of it?"
"Not at all," cried Blankton. "On the
contrary, I will employ the best teacher
obtainable and will pay the expenses of
teaching them allâ do it with pleasure. If
you agree to take the girls I shall hand
you $50 in the morning."
"Certainly, I shall only be too glad to
take them, and they will find meâ"
"Bee pardon, but the children ought to
have new clothes before they come to the
City. Let me see! Could you go with me
to some of the downtown storesâ say,
day after to-morrow, and pick out some
dresses and sacques for them? "
"With pleasure! "
â¢â¢Good ! And, as to references, I will
trust to my own ability to read character."
"Here is my husband's professional
card, sir," and Mrs. Brown handed out one
of Joshua's cards. It said "lawyer" on
it. Mr. Blankton smiled and Dowed, and
before he finally got out of the front pate
he had said that he would write immedi
ately for the piano. "I'll recollect the
fifty dollars in the morning; and if you
want moreâ say, a hundredâ just say the
word."
Mr. Blankton was gone. Fifty dollars a
month! Piano! Rich miner! Mrs. Brown
congratulated herself. The tide of luck
had turned. At tea Brown couldn't be
lieve the story he heard. It sounded too
much like an Arabian Night's tale; but
| Brown was perfectly willing to have for
tune shower its blessings on him.
Morning came! Then noon! Still no
Blankton! Mrs. Brown began to have
painful misgivings. Another day passed,
and no Blankton. On the third day
Joshua read in the papers about a clever
swindler, who answered advertisements
after the manner of the affluent Mr.
Biankton, ana whose game was to work
himself into a woman's confidence, agree

"Guess that professional card of mine
saved us," cogitated Joshua. Then Mr.
Brown went home and read his spouse a
lesson for her future guidance.
It happened that a friend of humanity,
making a house-to-house canvass in the
interest of hygiene and pure foods, was
just then in the Brown parlor, favoring
Mrs. B. with his advice on the compara
tive value of fruits and meats.
"You must feed the children well,"
went on the scientist and benefactor of bis
race, as Brown entered the hallway.
"Avoid meats as far as possible. Give
them plenty of ripe fruit in season; tea
and coffee are unnecessary stimulants;

The door creaked â Brown appeared, his
face as radiant as the morning. He was
happy to have been deceived. And had
the dream come true! Fifty dollars!
Piano! Nay, nay I And a moment later
Joshua collapsed like a Northwestern
boom.
"This is my husband," said the house
wife, leading forward the smiling and
bowing Brown. "Joshua," and here came
the unnerving snock, "let me make you
acquainted with Professor Helpusall, who
devotes his whole time to the work of

Wharf Urchins Who KnoW Qood
Things and KnoW HoW to
Qet Jhem
Not a rare picture at the rendezvous of
the "white rats of the waterfront," under
the rocky brow of Telegraph Hill, over
looking the foot of Sansome street, is that
of a lot of poorly clad youngsters busily
engaged in pouring into their gullets the
rich milk of the cocoanut. As they pat
their stomachs in acknowledgment of the
fresh receipt, it occurs to the observer that
milk and honey never received more cor
dial welcome to the insides of thirsty new
anivals in a promised land than this milk
of the cocoanut receives as it flows into
these eager mouths. Down around the
portion of the water front indicated, life
and its luxuries are enjoyed. The "white
rats" are not content with fresh boiled
crabs, clam-soup and the varieties of domes
tic fruits and vegetables that commonly
form a part of the bill of fare. Like Nob
Hill aristocrats, they hanker after im
ported articles.
Whenever a vcsel lands here from
Tahiti, or some other of the islands of the
South Seas, with a cargo of cocoa nuts, the
"rats" prepare for a picnic Not that the
consignees of the cocoauuts are reckless in
their liberality. They are not in the. habit
of distributing the nuts jrrfctis aronnd the
watpr front. When a cargo of 10,000 to
50,000 cocoanuts arrives, and is piled on
the wharf awaiting the wagons of the com
mission merchants, a special oflicer usually
watches the mountain of nuts with an
eagle eye. His task is not an easy one.
The water-front urchins know just about
when to expect the South Bea vessels, and
they gather in force to raid the cocoanut
piles, if such a thing be possible. The
youngsters go about the business system
atically, fully appreciating the fact that
an officer is on the alert for their kind of
people, and they calculate the chances to
get clear of the watchman when they
make a haul.
When there are a couple of piles of co
coanuts on the wharf, as sometimes hap
pens, a few of the urchins attract the at
tention of the guard Dy rather noisily
making their way to one of the hills of
nuts. They invariably succeed in getting
themselves chased off. These urchins, let
it be understood, are as spry as cats, fleet
as greyhounds, shrewd as foxes. The
clatter of the feet of the guard as he pur
sues, for a short distance, the fleeing
arabs is the signal for another division of
the Rang, which has been lying under
cover, to spring to the nut-piles from an
opposite direction. The guard turns back
to charge upon the new enemy, which has
already, in a twinkling, grabbed up as
many cocoanuts as it can manage to flee
with and is in hasty retreat.
The boyÂ« do this work so quickly that,
by the time the officer: reaches the whis
kered importations from monkey-land, the
young rascals are buried from view in
some alleyway and the cocoanuts have
been sacked and secreted somewhere to
await a safe moment for transfer to the
rendezvous below Telegraph Hill. Smart
as the guard may be, he will hardly es
cape being tricked. Almost as sure as a
cargo of cocoanats is landed in port the
white rats get ; a goodly share of them.
Sometimes they are forced to resort tc
bolder measures to attain their object, but
they are never wholly unsuccessful. They
have been known to lie in the bottom of
express wagons which â¢ are being driven
along the wharf and to surprise the watch
man by springing: out suddenly when
near the nut-pile, snatching a couple of
big ones and scampering away as swift as
thought.
i When the nuts are loaded on drays the
"rats" often follow the loads uptown, and
sometimes, when opportunity offers, they
, sneaK .up and grip the fiber as an Indian
grips the scalplock, with the difference
that the boys come away with the cocoa
nut's head as well as its scalp. At another
time they may use a lath or. a long. pole to
knock the . nuts ;â¢ off , the dray . into the
street. When a â¢ cocoanut is picked up in
the street it belongs to the finder when:
the arabs find it. And whatever number
they get is borne to their easting-place,
where a crude state of socialism prevails;
where privileges are eaual, and where the
cocoanut milk and the cocoanut meat are,
for the time being, the drink and food of
the joyful celebration.'

Here is an idea for I
a dinner entertain- 1
ment, if one desires I
to have something I
distinctive. It is I
fresh from Paris as I
well ; . from that city I
which seems the nat-B
ural home for fantasy I
and whose people ap-M
pear not to take life I
so "seriously as we do I
in the States. The^^^^^^^^^^l
busiest of them, even
down to the petit marchand in a shop
scarcely four feet by six, finds time to say
good-day and good-by. Perhaps the Celtic
mind does not take as easily as the Gallic
to personal fantastic adornment; but,
even granting such, when one would be
merry one naturally selects the best model
to pattern from, and the diner en costume
affords opportunities for combination of
dignity and gayety highly commendable.
The conventional evening dress is usually
adhered to in these dinners, with the ex
ception of the head, upon which, however,
all the fantasy imaginable may be lav
ished.
This, of course, occasionally requires a
slight adaptation in the gown to make a
pleasing whole,
A full-rigged ship, properly manned,
carries us back to the extravagances of a
century ago, but nothing could be more
coquettish than La Frigate perched on a
mass of auburn curls with a cnou of nile
green tulle introduced on either side to
ward the back to soften the lines. The
hull of the ship is of cardboard . covered
with red plush and bordered with gold.
The sailors are tiny dolls, the sails are of
lace and the masts are made of very light
wood. A ruche of the tulle encircles the
neck and a decollete gown of pink makes
a charming ensemble. '" ' â 
The jockey is a pretty desipn for Ma
dame la Chaperone. Any combination of
colors may be selected, but for gray hair a
cap in old gold ana heliotrope 'in particu
larly effective. A striped. handkerchief in
white and mauve twisted twice around
the throat, with': the loose ends fastened
under the chin with an appropriate brooch
of whip and horseshoe design, and a gown
of- old gold 1 satin with a regalia of helio
trope completes the idea.
The design for Night is equally charm"
ing for blonde or brunette. A vaporous
chou of pale blue, star-spangled in silver,
is placed on each side of * the coiffure and
continues in drapery to the blue gown.

The fantasy of Louis XVI admits of a
large amount of variation. If, for instance,
a choice of colors like the following be
adopted â rose for the gown, blue for the
hat and the filets in the hair, tne ostrich
plumes of olive green, the roses in shaded
red and the white satin ribbon brocaded
in all the colors â the effect of the costume
on a pretty woman becomes ravissante.
In contrast to this is the simple design
of the Press. A red siik kercnief, striped
with gold, is knotted gracefully on the left
side with a gold quill, the sign of the
trade, stuck through it. A gown in mauve
| brocade, with epaulets and embroidery in
white and gold, completts the idea, which

La Colombe blanche is for the debu

cheeks and the tiny noeud under her chin

Eighteen young ladies traveling together in
a body wÂ©uld attract attention anywhere.
And when they are all dressed alike in pretty
uniforms and skimming graceiully along on
so many bicycles the sight is a doubly inter
esting one.
In Marysvilie, where innovations of any kind
are almost as rare as bicycles in Borneo, such
an event has occurred, with a mild sensation
as the result, as harmless and as wc'.come as a
shivering glass of soda on a summer's day.
Whether the young ladies planned a si: :
for their friends or not is not known. If they
did they should feel very happy with the suc
cess of it. If not, it served at any rate to intro

At the Hotel Mateo.
At the Hotel Mateo, San Mateo, the Fonrth
was spent in a very pleasant way. A tennis
match had been arranged between the guests
at the* hotel and the Alameda Tennis Club, and
it proved to be a great drawing card, the
benches around the tennis court being
crowded throughout the game. It was fonnd
advisable Instead of making it a contest be
twen Alameda ana San Mateo, to mix the two
learns and thus have a more evenly matched
game. At the close of the game prizes were
presented to the successful players by Mi-,s
Isabel Sherwood. In the evening there was a
dance in the hotel, dancing being kept up to
an early hour in the morning. The music
was supplied by the symphony orchestra.
There was also a very fine display of fireworks
in the hotel grounds, the intervals between
the pieces being filled in by the large crowd
singing "America" and the "Star-spangled
Banner" with the greatest enthusiasm.

At the Vendome.
The nast week, especially during the Fourth,
was a lively one at the Vendome. The spacious
grounds, rotunda, verandas, and in fact every
bit of available space was taxed to its utmost

tentive audience, who showed their apprecia
tion by their frequent applause. Cycling re
ceives more atteution than any other out-of

forsaken.

Qotham Weather Is Sultry ar\d JKovisarxds
/\re Lea^irxg for Europe
NEW YORK, N. V., July 7. -At this
scasin of the year the weather be
comes terrific, anJ long after sunset heat
waves rise like columns of pale smoke from
the stone buildings that have been absorb
inp the sun's rays all day long. Up to
niUnight any attempt to get a little sleep
is {ruitless. At that hour, however, a slight
change comes and one can get a few
hours of rest; provided, of course, always
that the coal man does not dump a few
tens into the alley beneath your window.
Tue coal game is quite popular here now â
c.>al being cheap.
Landlords take advantage of the market
and load up for the winter. Inconsequence j
coaling goes on in all the apartment blocks j
for at least a straight week, or until the |
basements are filled and your trunks are
carefully covered up. It would not be sur
prising to me to discover that the janitor
had broken open a trunk or two and found j
room for a little more coal on the inside.
Excursion boats leave every pier daily ]
for the various watering places both near
and far. The passengers are divided into
three classes â moneyed men, the working
class ana tramps. The latter element go as
far up the rivers as tUeir few red cents
will take them and as much farther as
they can get without being kicked off.
Thousands of people leave daily and an
average of $8,000,000 a month goes to Eu- '
rope alone to be spent a-touring by Amer- j
ican travelers. Of course, this represents
the millionaires and men and women of i
luxury and idleness, who intend to do the i
continent "large."
This enormous output of human beings j
leaves the city socially marred, and those
who do come here merely use it as a eate j
to get somewhere else. Most of the thea
ters are sliut down and the roof-gardens
furnish most all the theatrical amuse
ment, considerable of it being very in
ferior. Variety people who cannot afford i
to go to the watering-place or lay off for j
the summer months allow themselves to
be billed as stars and inflict their very or
dinary talents on the perspiring audience.

That the Government has its right eye
on California there is no longer further
doubt. Only last Thursday William C.
Harris, the great piscatorial and lish cul
ture authority, as well as the editor of the
American Angler, left New York, com
missioned by the Government to prepare,
ready for press, a work on American game
fish, to be fully illustrated and printed in
the highest style of the art. This book
will concern California most particularly,
Mr. Harris will first go into the Saw
Tooth Range in Idaho and from there to
California, beginning in the lower part of
the State and making his way toward the
north, passing Professor David Starr
Jordan at Palo Alto so as to give that
popular educator an opportunity to set
forth his famous chestnut on fish. About
three months will be consumed in all. and
the book will appear toward the end of the
year. It is to be the most complete pub
lication yet issued on the question, con
taining many colored plates.

Californians who happen to be in New
York at the present time are carrying
their heads a little huh over the victory
of Fred Webster, president of the Country
Club in the Golden State, owing to the
fact of his having won the international
cup at the shooting tournament in London
last Wednesday. He left the other side
on the day following, and will arrive in
the United States to find a big delegation
waiting to dine him with California zest.
After that he will be sent on to San Fran
cisco for another round at the bands of
the Country and the Pacific Union clubs,
both of which he is a member.
Jack Follansbee arrived from- his South
ern California ranch in the early part of
the week and sailed for England on the
following Thursday, to be present at the
Henley-Yale race. He took along several
friends and will make a three months'
trip and return the latter part of the sum

F. D. Ryan, District Attorney of Sacra

can see them making toward the roof

Judge Joseph J. Burke, presiding judge
of the Bay District track, has been in the

Mrs. Mary Biliines-Boyson-Stevens, well

nians who happen to be visiting here.

The Semblance of a Love Jlffaip.
Margery Kennethson was blueâ not an unusual thing for her. Sbe saw nothing I
to live for. She had bad a quarrel with the only one she dearly loved, and could not â 
see where she had been to blame. The light of her life seemed to have gone out, â 
and altogether sbe considered life a failure. She would have sought surcease in â 
death, only she dreaded the morgue and the uncanny handling of its heartless H
attendants, and so she had concluded to be a martyr and live. She was a woman I
of affairs, who nevertheless enjoyed the idea of having a romance. She found I
pleasure in nursing prief, but on this particular evening the duties of theH
day had been too numerous and absorbing to permit her to indu ge in herH
usual pastime. She had not been up from the dinner-table very long when the bel- I
boy announced Messrs. Samuel and Hugh Wardwell.
"Tell them I Â«hall be down shortly," she said, and in a few minutes descended to I
the hotel parlor, wondering on the way what could bring Samuel Wardwell to visit I
her. His brother Hugh she knew very well â Knew him to be anything but a ladies' I
man, iriven to social calls. In fact, be was so unwieldy and generally awkward that, I
notwithstanding his great fund of information and fondness for jollity, which I
appeals to women as well as to men, he was looked upon by 'iis acquaintances in
the light of a big tame bear, whose close proximity was a thing
to be warded off. Samuel Wardwell she did not Know at all,
except by hearsay, and so naturally sne wondered at the import
of the visit.
"Good evening, Mr. Wardwell," she said, as she offered her
hand to Hugh Wardwell; and in a manner all her own, she
introduced herself to the stranger. Thinking it might be serious
business, likely to suffer by interruptions, Margery soon invited
the gentlemen to her own parlor, always in order for company,
of which, however, she bad very little. This new acquaintance j
was to her an object of curiosity. He was reputed to be very
wealthy, and she had never before even talked with any one
who was endowed with so much of this world's goods, and in
her matter-of-fact way thought topics treating of fruit and
grain and cattle would lead, to the business on hand. Very soon
she found tLat it made no difference how she might turn the
conversation, it would surely drift back to her own individual
self.
"How many acres in your ranch, Miss Kenuethson?" asked 1
District track to : Fetriir* HÂ»rtman. He
knows everybody that flits along the rialto,
and has done nothing but shake hands
since his arrival. ~ ' - " '"â¢..
In answer to a question as to what he
was 'â¢ doing so far away from the
coast, he simply winked his eye and re
plied in an undertone :
"Just got a little scheme on. Same old
thing. Theatricals. I'll be back in San
Francisco before long and if: old John
Nash don't land on both feet then I cleave
no ice at all. Â£ No, can't tell you what it
is to be, 1 but it can be covered by the
words, 'something big.' " .'
Mr. Nash was whirled away by a detach
ment from ;Koster<fe Bial's, and it is per-
I haps safe to predict from the manner of
the gentleman that he will j open : - nothing
less than < a three-acre roof 'â  garden in
Golden Gate Park with Nordica and the
| DeÃezske Brothers doing variety acts.
> He promised to let me in next week, : but
I I assume that he is '.: waiting to " secure
j Melba before giving out the jj facts . to | the
i anxious public." He is stopping for the
I time over at Bath Beach, Long Island. â¢ ;
i j F. E. Kaverne, â¢ ; who; has spent several
i ' seasons at the California racetracks as a
i ' bookmaker, is back in New York. He was
j holding forth to a crowd of bookmakers
! at Levy's poolrooms last Thursday on the
: fine horses and climate to be found in
; California. I find that people who have
i visited the coast always have a good word
1 | for it.
Sam Thall, the old treasurer of the Bald
: win Theater, but of late years advance
i agent for Joe Grismer, is soon to take a
[ company of his own out on the road. It
i will be quite a jump to the front for Mr.
Thall, who has been living most of his
i life away doing good theatrical work for
other people. Most all California thea
j trical people who have come to New York
; have succeeded in one way or another and

To the gourmets in San Francisco I
would like to communicate a few facts,
i Strolling into the Italian quarter recently
, it was my pleasure to drop into a little in
. stitution where all tricks known to the
art of gastronomy are executed well. I
r i had almost finished my dinner when a
, j small party. of gaily dressed ladies en
f tered and signified by signs and mild
, forms of abnse, directed at the foreign
r waiter, that they wanted a spaghetti din-
I ner. Presently his excellency brought in a
t massive stack of this delicious food,
l smothered .in a truffled tomato sauce.
[ i Those who have not attempted to assail
. ! spaghetti believe that it is easy to over
. j come, but one must have at some time in
. i his life been engaged in the snake-charm
ing occupation to get anything like full
possession of it. It writhes, glides, wobbles
r | and escapes from the fork just at that
; i period when it is most desired. - The un
. initiated spaghetti-eater may die getting a
r start. Not so, however, with these ladies.
. 1 They each called for a tablespoon, and
\ \ holding it firmly in the left hand plunged
1 i their fork, held in the right hand, into the
. I quivering luxury. With a rapid move
! ; ment the point of the fork, containing the
2 : spaghetti, was placed in the hollow of the
! spoon and twirled at the ends of the tines
. I until the spaghetti was wound in a neat
f bail at the end of the fork. This is the
, { conquering period, and a deft motion
| toward the open mouth places you in
. â  charge of the morsel. I watohed tbe game
f with interest. My eyes wandered from
c i table to table. It was going on every
p j where. The twirling was part of the din
j ! ncr, and all hands were engaged in it. My
;> ! thoughts went back to the old Franco
. American restaurant and the time when I
used to eat spaghetti like the necromancer
. that takes 500 yards of ribbons out of bis
mouth and fills a plug hat.
a j The twirl in the spoon is the thing. . Try
I it.

It is gratifying to the ladies to know that

Samuel Ward well after awhile, for Margery was unfortunate
enough to own ooe.
"In the whole place, over two thousand," was her reply.
"It ought to be joined to Hugh's here," said the diplomatic
brother, while the other waited to see the effect of this
comment.
Not yet half taking in the situation, Margery, quick in most
things, would have driven out thoughts of the true state of
affairs had they presented themselves to her mind, and so
simply replied: "Why, the places are too far apart; that could
not be, unless nil the land between could be owned by one or the
other. Does your brother think of buying off other owners?"
"No, but my wife lias heard so much about your smartness
that she has concluded she'd like to have you for a sister-in-law."
Evidently, if one particular man did not appreciate her,
here was one who did. But it was an uncomfortable moment
for Margery. She did not feel at all flattered at the love-making
of tbis great mountain of grease, even although done by proxy.

A hard-working and ambitious student re
marked the other day that she had learned the
leads, but was troubled what to play second
hand. This is mainly the result of failure to
pay sufficient attention to the Inferences tbnt
can be drawn if the leads are well known. A
student seeing A,Q, 10,9 together in hand
will quickly learn to lead the nine from this
combination, but if the nine is laid on the
table alone he will not as quickly recognize
what is in the leader's hand. In other words
the studeut must learn to '-box the compass
backward" as well as forward. The old rule
for second hand to play low has so many
exceptions that it is violated as ofteu as fol
lowed. If second hand holds the X and one
small and a 9 is played originally there should
be no mental debate as to whether the X or the
small should be played. The holding of the
leader should be as plain as if the cards were
exposed.
Absolute rules are hard to give, and in whist
Age cannot wither, nor custom stale
Its infinite variety.
Yet second hand has as a guide the Informa
tion given by the original card, and this
knowledge must be taken advantage of rather
than any rule.
In the few cases where the card led gives but
little information the old rule of second hand
low should be followed, unless holding hii*h
cards in sequence, as with Q, J, and one
small, play the J (as the small card will do as
well as the J to protect the Qon the second
round) unless the lead is such as to mark the
cards in the leader's hand. For instance, if
you hold Q, J, 9, and a 7 is led, play the 9 and
not the J. The leader must hold either A. 10,
8, 7, or X, 10, 8, 7, and the 9 will win or force
the A or K.
If the original card led is the 9 or a higher
one, the leader's cards are usually well
marked. The Q announces the X, the J
both Q and K. Such inferences are simple.
But the lower cardr. are more difficult. If,
however, the second-hand tables of Hamilton
or other good whist writers are carefully
studied the 8, 7 and 6 tell as plain a story as
the high cards.
Suppose a 7 is led and you, as second hand,
hold Q, 9, 8, 2. Now. if jrou are thoroughly
familiar with the combinations from which a
7is led as fourth best you know that it must
include either the 8, 9or 10. As you have t lie
8 and 9, the leader must hold the 10. Further
you snould know that there are but two com
binations in which the 10 is found in con
junction with the 7 without either the 8 or 9,
i. c.. A, Q, 10, 7, or A, J, 10, 7. As you hold
the Q, the leader must hold the A, J, 10, 7.
Having this information, you can play intel
ligently. Knowing the only card that can
win the 7 is the king, you should play the 8â
to force the X if in third hand, or enable your
partner to hold it up if he has it.
Suppose you held X, 10, 9, 2, and & 7 was
led to your right, would you cover? Perfect
familiarity with the leads will show you at
once that the leader must have A, Q, 8, 7, or
A, J, 8, 7. Your X will unquestionably take
the trick, bat it is better sot to play it, as the
opponent's suit would be at once established.
Third hand, or your partner, must nold either
Q or Jâ the odds being equal. Play the 2,
trusting the trick to your partner and holding
the 9 to preserve the double tenace over the
leader.
Second hand must rlso be on the watch for
forced or irregular leads. If you hold A. X, 9,
and an 8 is led on your right, you should not
think the 9 will bold the trick, because you
have three better than the 8. The lead must
be irregular. Good whist perception and
judgment will oven aid second hand in deter
mining when a lead is not normal.
It is not every hand that gives you oppor
tunnies of reading the cards perfectly. If your
holding is very weak in the suit led you can
not place the cards, but your play in such a
case cannot be important, but it is necessary
to know what to do when an opportunity
comes.
You must learn the inferences that can be
drawn from the card led, or you will not un
derstand the meaning of the leader's cards,
and, not understanding, you cannot oppose
him successfully. Do not give up until you
know every combination which the leader
must hold when be leads a 7, 8 or 9.
[ The more yon can read the cards as they fall
the keener your enjoyment of the game, and
this alone will be ample compensation for the
time and work devoted to the study.
President i-chwarz, in his opening address at
the sixth American Whist League Congress,
touched upon a matter of great importance to
the whist world, as follows:
There is still another question, which I ap
proach with some hesitation, because there is
a difference of opinion as to the policy io be
pursued. At the first congress Mr. Tristwas
not present, but he sent us a communication
in which he advocated the adoption of some
textbook upon the game for the purpose of
making whist what it was intended to be and
every card an intelligible sentence. He said
in that paper thai if a whist-player from the
East met one from the West, it would not be
necessary for them to ask each other what
system they played, bui the cards would speak
for themselves. Nothing was done at that
congress, and nothing has been done since.
In common with others I had hoped that after
that congress there would be a blending, and
that the annual meetings would have a
tendency to harmonize different systems and
different methods. Instead of that, however,
we have been getting wider and wider apart,
until to-day a whist-player cannot sit at a table
with a stranger without asking him what sys
tem he plays. New conventions have arisen.
The echo means two or three different thing*
There are half a dozen different methods of
discard; there are long-suit theorists and short
suit theorists, and taken together there is a
wider difference to-day thau there was at the
start.
Now, it seems to me that it is the duty of
the American Whist League to remedy this
state of affairs if it is possible. Ws cau ap
point a committee of expert players, men who
have fought their way to the front, and let
them sift the different methods in vogue at
the present time and recommend to the whist
players of the country that which they think
is best.
I do not mean by this that we should adopj
any textbook upon the game or that we should
aroitrarily impose upon the players of the
country any particular system, nor would I re
strain individual liberty of action. It would
be simply in the nature of a recommendation
and would tell. the players of the American
Whist League and the whist-players at large
just what we thought was the best without
estimated me," said she; and again aiming to turn the conver
sation from herself she recalled tbe fact that the would-be
matchmaker before her was said to own fabulous tracts of land.
"Are you the brother who has such a large farm in S
County? Eight thousand acres I have been told."
"Eighty thousand acres. Give you a thousand if you'll have
this chap/
Imagine poor Margery's consternation at the thought of the
final outcome! She began to feel queer all over, although the
whole thing was so laughable to her that she could scarcely
resist showing her amusement. She bad not time to make a
reply, before the thoughtful lover, with an eye to business and
the possible future, found his tongue, end then taking his
brother at his word, opened up a discussion as to which thousand
acres he would give. So unlike tbe tall and lank diplomat, the
heavy-weigbt drifted so far away from the main point at issue
that to bring him to his senses and let tbe whole cat out of the
bag at one and tbe same time the impatient negotiator turned
suddenly around and the object of their attentions gave full
! preventing them from playing something else
i if they desired to do so.
In accordance with the above the following
resolution was adopted:
Resolvid, That the president of the league
appoint a committee of seven to take action
upon the wisdom of appointing a permanent
{ standing committee to examine Mito the dif
ferent systems and methods of play now in
vogue and recommend which, in their judg
ment, was the best.
The president appointed the following com
mittee: P. J. Tormey of San Francisco, chair
man; Milton C. Work, Philadelphia; Robert
H. Weems, Brooklyn; Cassius M. Paine, Mil
waukee; Nicholas B. Trist, New Orleans; H. A.
Mandell, Detroit; C. A. Henriques, New York;
George & Bunn, St. Paul ; E. C. Howell, Boston.
At the closing business session this advisory
j committee reported that it approved the
I recommendation of Mr. Schwara concerning
the movement toward suggesting a uniform
I system of play, and they will report in full
j either at the winter meeting of the executive
committee or at the next annual congress.
Mr. Schwarz says that it must not be under-
I stood that this advisory committee will select
! a system of play which the league is bound to
i adopt, but that it is only expected to make
; suggestions for the guidance of students of
the game who are of themselves unable to
1 choose between the merits of the systems.
It is not believed that the members of the
i league throughout the country would be will
i ing to tie themselves down to any prescribed
! system. The midwinter meeting of the di
i rectors of the league will be held at Nashville,
â  Tenu., in the latter part of January, and the
j report and recommendations of the committee
I will be looked for with iptereu.
WHISTLETB.
If the sixth whist congress has shown one
' thing more than another it is tnat the short
| suit system, which had many advocates
! around the tables, is doomed. The superior
| ity of the old established long-suit leads was
! asserted in almost every match. The short
suiters made a terrific noise before the con
j gross. Since its adjournment the camp is
pervaded with terrific silence. They are try
ing to draw attention to and comfort from the
: fact that ono pair of short-suiters captured the
I prize in the seoond progressive match for
i pairs â but this small consolation would have
> been denied them bad all the opponents thor
! oughly understood the short-suit game. Short
suitism is another exploded fad. Such fads
are catching, like measles, and some persons
are more subject to the disorder than others,
I but time and experience effect a cure. Cav
endish hates fads, speaking thus about them
during the congress:
! I hate fads and I only know one method of
i treating them. Leave them alone. They will
' die a natural death. There is only one way of
playing whist, and that is the orthodox way.
! Occasionally some one has an idea of playing
the game in a different way. He tells* his
friends how successful he has been and he
gets followers, but in the long run they will
vent to her merriment when she heard him tell the other "that
he was the fellow to go courting that he ever saw."
Samuel Wardwell had fulfilled his mission, and it was time
for him to take his leave. Even then the dense lover thought
there was nothing more to say, and wao about taking his de
parture at the same time. The brother, however, would not
have it so. He was not a believer in unfinished work, and so
insisted on going away alone, thus giving the bashful one the
chance to close the bargain. It is needless to say that the finish
was in keeping with all the rest of the "transaction"â that when
Margery assured the luckless aspirant that she thought of matri
mony just then with no one, he, without meaning to be offen
sive, but simply to put a proper value on himself, told her that
by rejecting him she was as much a loser as be was himself I
The recollection of this interview was very funny to her for
many a lone day. Her friends no longer found her gloomy in
the morning, but keenly enjoyed with her the recital of what
after all was no real love affair, but only the semblance of one.

find the old way the best. Let them alone. Do
not advertise them. Forget them.
The New York Tribune, speaking of the
exploded system and its hio;h priest, says:
One Boston team came to the congress ad
vertised as advocates of the short-suit lead,
but, after piay had opened and this team had
fairly started'in the contests, it was found that
the members of the team were divided among
themselves, and that two of the men were
short-suiters, while the other two played the
regular established game. The most unpopu
lar man who has shown himself at the con
gress is the correspondent of a newspaper
which is most cordially detested by whist
players, because of the slavery of the corre
spondent to the discredited short-suit idea.
According to the wor.is of a prominent dele
gate, this correspondent has repeatedly
claimed victories for his alleged short-suiters,
but bis attempts to have the players classed as
short-suiters have been repudiated by the
players themselves. It has been repeatedly
asserted that the qnartet representing the New
York Whist Club has played the short-suit lead
in all its games, and it was believed yesterday
by the New Yorkers, in view of past utterances
by the short-suiter, that their victory in the
American Whist League trophy contest would
be recorded as a signal proof of the merits of
the short-suit sysiem. In order to forestall
any such advertisement, Messrs. Henriques
and Buffi v ton issued a signed statement to the
effect that in none of the games that they
have played in the congress have they played
what is known as the short-suit game.
The progressive straight whist contest tor
pairs at the congress was won by Mr. and Mrs.
Henry Payot of the San Francisco Whist Club.
Fifteen tables were in the game, and Mr. and
Mrs. Payot won with a score of 33 tricks
eained.
It is not generally known tbat "Cavendish"
Jones is a medical man. He is a member of
the Royal College of Surgeons of London,
England, of more than forty years' standing,
and a member of the governing board of the
Society of Apothecaries; but he has long
ceased to practice. Here are his opinions
about duplicate whist and the congress:
"How do I like duplicate whist? I like it very
well, indeed. Such a series of games as were
played at the congress could only be played by
the duplicate system. But I must confess tbat
I think the straight game is more sociable, and â 
preferable for that and other reasons. We had
some very fine players at the convention, with
whom it is distinctly a pleasure to play. Such
a convention would be impossible in England.
The people would not piay progressive whist."
The Trist Duplicate Whist Club won second
prize in the progressive match for fours at the
congress.
The first prize in the straight whist tourna
ment at the Sau Francisco Whist Club was won
by Mr. Hotaling, who has only to be better
known to be recognized as one of the strongest
players of the coast. Dr. Gilbert captured the
second prize and Mr. Eyre the third.
The second straight whist series will close
August 1 and the prize will be awarded to the
highest net tricks, irrespective of number of
games.
The indulgence of correspondents is re
quested until the return of the whist editor
from the East, when queries will ba answered.
The awarding of prizes for correct solutions to
problems is also postponed.
Mr. McMillan, one of the experts from the
Portland Whist Club, is in town.
Harper's Weekly of July 1 contains interest
ing whist letters from Cavendish and Trist,
and a photographic view of the congress in
session.

At trick 2 South, having won his partner's

BUSINESS MEN AND PAETY.
Less than forty-eight hours ago W. J.
Bryan of Nebraska was nominated for the
Presidency by the Democratic patty, and
already leadinz business men and news
papers of the political faith of that
| party are leaving it in droves, we
might say. And why are they
repudiating the platform and candi
dates of tlu-ir own party? There must be
something that is exerting a mighty influ
ence wnen men who have all their lives
been enthusiastic partisans make haste to
renounce party allegiance. There is no
mystery, however, in their abrupt and
determined renunciation of party, for the
Chicago convention forced the issue. It
demanded that the business interests of
the country make a radical departure from
true and tried commercial usages and
adopt business methods that are known
to be wrong in principle, and which
would be hurtful in practice. The conven
tion drove the business interests to choose
between sound business ethics and the va
garies of experimentalists, and they were
prompt to choose.
But this country-wide withdrawal of
Democrats from their party has been fore
shadowed in The Call's interviews with
many of the leading business men of Cal
ifornia during the last fortnight. Without
a shiL'le exception these interviews have
shown that the industries and tne com
merce of the country would consider a
declaration of policy for the conduct of
the Government such as was finally
adopted by the Chicago convention a
threat asainst the well-being of trade,
traffic and manufacture, and that it would
be the duty of every one interested in
widening and deepening the foundation of
the Nation's material growth to set the
seal of condemnation upon any such de
parture from sound business principles.
Business enterprises are not asking how
it happened that the Chicago convention
adopted a platform that is hostile to them,
nor do they ask why the purpose of the
convention was to further emphasise its
war upon the stronghold of the farmer,
the mechanic, the merchant and the
manufacturer. It is enough for them to
know that there is danger ahead and that
the wise course for them to pursue is to
array themselves on the side of those who
are fighting against the proposed ruinous
innovations. The machinery of the Demo
cratic party has been captured by foes to
its time-honored principles, and turned
to destroy the commercial agencies which
have made the wealth of the Nation ex
ceed that of every other country. Is it
strange, therefore, that the solid business
element of the Democratic party should be
pronounced in their condemnation of this
unblushing betrayal of their party? Is it
strange that they are hastening to the
side of McKinley to help the Republican
party save the commerce, the agriculture
and the industries of the country from the
iron hand of these revolutionists?
With business men it is not now a ques
tion of party politics, but a question of
preventing a commercial and industrial
chaos, and the belief that it is the duty of
business men of all parties to come to the
rescue is becoming widespread. Mr.
Bryan is the representative of the com
mercial experimentalists of the country,
and he is under willing promise to over
throw and overturn all existing business
agencies and appliances and introduce in
their stead principles of commercial inter
course between ourselves and between us
and other peoples that r.re based upon
dangerous experiment. There is not a
line of business ia all this broad land that
would not be crippled by the application
of the theories of the Chicago platform in
the conduct of the affairs of the Nation,
and as this is known to be true by those of
i all parties who are in active business life
j the widespread desertion of the party
which Altgeld now rules does not come as
a surprise. Business sense is quick to de
tect a threatening political policy.
00N0EENING MARRIAGE.
The question "Is marriage a failure?"
having returned from going to and fro in
the land and from walking up and down
it without finding a satisfactory answer,
another and rather more of a "piga in
clover" question has been started on the
rounds. It is, "How to marry rationally
and how not to tire of each other when
married." A spinster by the name of
Laura Cameron tellÃ tliP Weatmiiister Re
rim: that marriage will turn out all right
if the contracting parties have their love
"begin at the head and end at the heart,"
but as she does not designate the route it
should travel from head to heart, whether
via the spinal column, down through the
bronchial tubes or via the more circuitous
route of tbe solar plexus, she deeix-ns
rather than clears the mystery. But being
a spinster Miss Cameron's conclusions
would necessarily be theoretical and spec
ulative and therefore she cannot De con
kidered an authority, although her basic
principle, that is, "from the head to the
heart," is imbedded in a great conjugal
truth, only that she does not put it exactly
right.
If one lays aside the legal and com
mercial aspects of marriage and tackles
the problem as a branch of the philosophy
of life he will discover that the first error,
and which leads to all other errors, lies in
the silly, arbitrary and contradictory com
mand that each must take the other for
better or for worse. In fact, no man can
take a woman for better or for worse, nor
can a woman take a man for better or for
worse. Religion of some sort, sincerity
and intimacy are the first essentials, but
in all things the man inu t take himself
for better or worse, as must the woman
herself for better or worse ; and, it may be
added, each will grow better or grow worse
,as bis or her thoughts, aspirations and
conduct of life are good or evil. Yet each
one is in a very great degree responsible
for the ethical evolution as well an tbe in
volution of the other. In a measure each
one is the custodian of the other one's in
clination ana opportunity to strive ior
higher standards of existence. The ideal
of each should be complete oneness, which
is co-operation and sympathetic help in
all the ways of individual and mutual ad
vancement.
Married life is a bridge, Â«o to speak,
which spans the river of one's natural
life; but however imposing tbe structure
may be or however ornamental in archi
tectural design its greatest strength is at
its weakest point, the weakest point also
represents the degree of oneness that has
been secured, and which is not secured in
its fullness eicept when the law of natural
selection is understood and obeyed. When
failure in the avenues of commerce casts
a shadow over the bridge, or when success
blossoms into forgetfulness of the ties
which bind humanity into one family,
domestic events will sooner or later strip
the bridge of its ornamentation and im
posing otatelineea and show that it never
was more than false work.
John Ruskin once said that "every
noble life leaves the fiDer of it inter
woven forevtr in tbe work of the
world." It is largely true, no doubt,
that the noblest lives are found where
oneness in wedlock is the most com
plete, and to the careful student of the
book of nature and tbe book of life â he
who reads them meditatively and thought
THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 12, 1896.
fullyâis revealed the whole philosophy of
true married life, which is that it "is a
partnership in all science; a partnership
in all art; a partnership in every virtue
and in all perfection. It is a partnership
not only between those who are living
but between tho?e who are dead, and
those who are to be born." The love that
understands the^e things and is guided
by its own knowledge does not "begin in
the head and end in the heart.'* It is
without beginning, nor does it know of an
ending. ___^ ____________
HIS NAME IS SEWALL.
Arthur Sewall, the gentleman from that
Republican Gibraltar, the State of Maine,
was put at the tail or the Bryan ticket yes
terday, for what purpose no man could
tell. Air. Sewall is a gentleman ot the
highest respectability and the owner
of sailing vessels which plow many
waters ,!â  search of gold for their
owner. It is not supposed, however,
that be will weaken Bryan's chances.
When the people Â«et through with the
Nebraska omtor he probably will be sur
prised to see that he never had even so
much as the shadow of a cbauce of elec
tion.
If what they say about Mr. Bewall is
true it is cruel to take such advantage of his
party loyalty. He should have been left in
the consolation of the thought that he was
unknown, and, therefore, not known to be
a Democrat. He is said to be very rich,
but if he is Bryan will not want him for a
running mate, for a rich man on the ticket
might spoil Bryan's little scheme. His
purpose ia to pose as a poor man and ap
peal to the poor to rally to him in the
"great battle of the poor against the rich."
Bryan is a born political agitator and revo
lutionist, and demagogy is his meat and
drink. If he cannot fire the middle class
with hatred for capital employed in the
great industries of the country his efforts
to gain the Presidency will be futile, and
as he will fail, and tail utterly, why Sewall?
LAW OE ANARCHY.
The proceedings of the Chicago conven
tion in a most unmistakable manner
reveal the spirit which animated it. In
the proceedings there were no traces of
discipline, of a well-ordered will or of a
settled purpose growing out of a clear
conviction of what it were best to do. Hill
and Whitney may have had a plan and
Altgeld and the Senatorial clique may
have formulated some rule of conduct for
their action, but neither the New York
leaders, the Chicago bosses nor the South
ern chiefs could infuse saeacity into the
foolish mob, direct its action to any defi
nite end, or bring order out of its wild
confusion.
The ticket that resulted from such an
aimless, undirected, inconsiderate gather
ing is just what might have been expected.
A young stump speaker without a record
in public service, without experience in
any administrative ollice, without any
show of statesmanship, wÂ»i nominated for
the Presidency in a whirl of folly resulting
from the "whoop-up" of an impassioned
speech. After this evidence of lunacy the
convention adjourned for a night with
the avowed purpose of giving itself time
to act wisely in the selection of a candi
date for the Vice-Presidency. It met yes
terday without having the slightest idea
of whom it would nominate or why it
would nominate him, and after several
ineffectual ballots went off its feet and
gave the nomination to an unknown man
from Main*.
Both candidates are from Republican
States. It Bryan can get Populist support
be may possibly carry Nebraska, but Sewall
can give his party not the slightest hope of
carrying Maine. He has no reputation to
strengthen his party in other States and
in his own tie will not carry his borne
county. Never in our history was a ticket
nominated with less common-sense than
this. The convention simply went it blind.
It acted like an unorganized mobauimated
by no other idea than that of refusing to
follow any one who had a reputation as a
leader.
This lawlessness of action was the result
of a lawlessness of spirit. From Altgeld,
who is naif an anarchist, to Tiliman, who
is half a secessionist, there was in tiie con
vention every kind of a mischief-maker
known to the North, the South, the East
or the West. These men cared nothing for
the businci interests of the country, noth
ing for those great industries by which the
people live, nothing for the welfare of
workingmen or the industrious of any
class. They were there to give utterance
only to their own discontent and their de
sire for agitation and disturbance. They
allowed full license to their passions in
speech and action, and after harangues of
the lowest order of oratory from Altgeld
and Tiliman wound npby nominating tbis
ticket of Bryan and Sewall.
Before the Chicago convention met it
seemed the issue of the campaign would
be the choice between protection or free
trade, industry or idleness. To-day every
one realizes the dominant issue is between
law or disorder, government or anarchy.
If we are to have a government at all after
this election it must be a government by
the Republican party. Tnere is no other
choice. It is either McKinley and prosper
ity or Bryan and confusion.
OUR CHICAGO SEEVIOE.
The Call this morning can review with
more than ordinary satisfaction the work
it has done during the past week in re
porting the Chicago convention and the
great festival at Monterey. The conven
tion of course was the most exciting fea
ture of the week, and with all fairness to
our contemporaries we can justly claim to
have reported its proceedings more com
prehensively in matter, more concisely in
manner and more accurately than any
other journal on the Pacific Coast.
A particularly valuable portion of our
Chicago reports were the daily letters
from the Hon. James G. Maguire and the
Hon. John P. Irish. These gifted men,
who are the leaders of the silver and of
the goid wing of the Democratic party in
tbis City, are both of them vigorous
writers as well as keen obaeryers. Their
letters, contributed to The Call exclus
ively, revealed clearly the intense feeling
of the rival factions. The letters of Ma
guire rang with the jubilant tone of as
sured victory, while those of/ Irish gave
forth in every sentence a clang and a
clash iike the sound of a sword which
some fierce hand, is rattling in the scab
bard, impatient to draw it forth.
While these letters revealed the inner
feelingÃ of the combatants onr other
special correspondents, Cosgrave, Carleton,
Coe and MoGuire, reported all the scenery
of the drama, the appearance of the lead
ers, the words of the speakers, the enthu
siasm of the crowds ana ail tne thousand
incidents that made the proceedings by
day and night. In all this there waa no
padding, no fakes, no stuff sent simply to
fill space. Each correspondent had some
new aspect of the subject to describe.
Thore was no repetition and nothing was
omitted.
Tbe work of the week we submit as an
other evidence that our energies in the di
rection of legitimate journalism will be
found always equal to the importance of
the news and the interest of tbe public.
Now that the campaign is at hand intelli
gent men and women will desire an lm
partiai and accurate report of the proceed
ings of all parties, and tne best way to ob
tain that ia to read The Call. It speaks
for all.
THE CHRISTIAN ENDEAVOS.
Tn deciding to bold their convention of
1897 in Ban Francisco the International
Christian Endeavor did a wise thing, as
they will be more than wiiling to admit.
The low rate which the railways ill quote
for passage tickets, and the opportunity
which such a journey would give the
people east of the mountains to see the
best and the most glorious part of America,
will, no doubt, be taken advantage of by
thousands. It is *aft> to aay that 50,000
strangers will be here during the sitting of
the convention, with one-fourth of the
number coming from beyond the State
line of California.
Naturally those coming from other Srates
will want to make trips to the various lo
calities of interest and see all there is to
be seen, which would make their sojourn on
the-ooast extend into weeks. But another
good will come of holding the convention
here which should not be lost Bight of.
Every one of the ihousands who come from
abroad is sure to return an advertising
acent for California, and out of it all there
should be a tide of immigration turned
toward the Golden Gate country, for surely
they all would sound the praise of this
most delightful land.
Nothing should be left undone to not
only swell the numbers coming to the
highest point, but while they are here
they should he made to feel how true and
sincere California hospitality is. Such a
class of people as compose the Endeavor
would grace and honor any community,
and when they had gone away the recollec
tion of them would be a pleasant reminder
of the fact that tens of thousands of
America's young people are earnestly
working all the time ior the elevation of
humanity.
Now that the excitement of the Demo
cratic convsntion has somewhat abated
time may be taken to revert to the big
rowing match on the river Thames in
which Yale's crew took part. It is a mat
ter for regret that the American boys did
not defeat the Leander crew, but there is
some comfort in the reflection that the
Leanders were victorious over all the other
contestants in the recatla and won the
championship cup. At any fate onr
Yankee representatives were not walloped
by any second-rate oarsmen.
The Christian Endeavorers will find a
true California welcome when they arrive
bere, and every citizen in proportion to
his means should assist in making the re
ception a notable one in every respect.
"THE CALL" GETS THE PRIZE.
From Last Night's Dally Report.
Yesterday morning Thb Call published 23
columns about tho convention, the Chronicle
29 and Examiner 96%. The public have there
fore unanimonsly voted the prize for the best
convention report to Thk Call.
GROWTH OF WOMAN SUFFRAGE
SENTIMENT.
Those who are not in a position to see the
newspaper exchannes of the State from day to
day can hardly realise the rapid advance of
the sentiment in favor of woman suffrage.
The women themselves have made a splendid
canvass of the State, and in all the counties
where their conventions have been held the
result is seen in an increase and strengthening
of opinion favorable to the enfranchisement of
women and a modification of the feeling in op
position. The first great turn in the tide in
this direction, ho\re,-er, date* from the action
of the Refiublicnn convention. May 6, in the
incorporation of v woman-suffrage plank in its
platform. This invested the question tt once
with the dignity of a political issue and en
; ahled the newspapers of the State to indorse it
t with the party sanction. This has been done
with remarkable unanimity, over 100 of them
having declared editorially in favor of the
pending amendmeut. To The Call of May S
rightfully belongs the credit of inspiring that
action on the part of the convention.
There is no longer any denial of the justice
and equity of the woman's claim to the ballot,
j There is practically no doubt but that the best
interests of the State and municipality would
be advanced through the influence of woman
I in government. The opposition has resolved
itsulf substantially into two classesâ the con
servative, nqn -progressive element, who still
have lingering doubts as to its effect upon
domestic life and upon thewom6n themselves,
and the other elomnnt who from the very
character of their daily lives regard as a
menace the granting of any further power to
women.
But notwithstanding the opposition of th#se
two extremes of society the amendment will
be carried by the great middle clfttsefl, who are
the backbone of every progrusMve movement.
I Tney have stood solidly behind the auti
j slavery cause, the temperance reform, the
I Btruirg!e<>f labor, nnd now will sustain and
I curry forward to victory the demand of the
women for that citlien's right to vote which is
guaranteed by ".he constitution of the United
States. Si'san B. Anthony.

can go from San Francisco to Oakland or Ala
meda, and from there ride on his wheel

successive weeks it must appear four times.
Ireland's Populationâ Subscriber. There
are no official tigures showing the population
In Ireland in the year 1846. The census of
1841 shows 8,196,597, and that of 1851 shows
6,574,278. During the year 1846 and in 1847
there were a great many deaths on account of
the famine, consequently a great reduction in
population.

tained your first papers in the city of Chi
cago before the great fire of October, 1871,
ard have lost them, you will have to write to

lady who does not declare whether she is a Miss
or a Mrs. the party written to, in reply, is not
required to use the usual formal sentence,
"Dear Miss" or "Dear Madame," or even Miss
or Madame, for the reason that a letter signed
With only the given and family name without
prefix, as, lor instance, "Jennie Jones," leaves
the recipient of the letter in doubt In such a
case it is proper to olace in the left hand lower
corner "To Jennie Jones."
Shakespeareâ P. N. G., City. The first folio
edition of Shakespeare's works published in
1623 shows that the spelling of the Bard of
Avon was not the same as it is in the modern
editions of his works. A quotation from "All's
Well That Ends Well" will show the difference
In the first folio edition, which was published
with the assurance that it was a literatim
transcript, there it "Fairs maide send forth
thine eye, this yoothfull parcell of noble
bachellors;" and this is rendered in the
modern text as "Fair maid send forth thine
eye, this youthful parcel of noble bachelors."

mother is the guardian of her children
and of their property and should en
ter into an agreement to sell their
property, she having obtained the right
to do so, and subsequently have another
party appointed as guardian of her children
and the Dew guardian should obtain an or
der from court to sell their property to the
highest bidder, it would require a judicial de
termination for the purpose of ascertaining if
the agreement of tbe mother to sell would
hold. This department is willing to state what
the law is, but it cannot apply the law to the
facts and give judicial opinions.
Bicycle Timeâ S. H., City. The fastest time
ever made by a horse was that made by Sal
vator, running in a rnce against time at Mon
mouth, August 28, 1890, in 1:35.'. 2 . This time
was beaten by W. J. Edwards in this State, who
made a mile on a bicycle on a straight
away track at Livermore, Alameda Coun
ty, in 1:35 2-5. Even that record hap
been beaten within two months. M.O.Den
nis riding a bicycle (unpaced), on a straight
away track, slightly down grade, and with the
wind at the rate of sixty miles an hour blow
ing against his back, made a mile in 1:11 8-5
the fastest time ever made. Salyator's 1:35K
has been beaten several times.
Addreubino a Lady â V. L., Honolulu, H. I.
A lady never suggests her husband's occupa
tion, rank or military position by her visiting
card, and for the same reason it is improper
and a breach of etiquette to address a commu
nication to a lady and designate her by the
position her husband occupies. If the lady is
the wife of John H. Jones, Governor of
Arizona, the proper way to address a letter
to her is Mrs. John H. Jones, not Mrs.
Governor John H. Jones, for she is not
the Governor and the title belongs alone to
her husband. If the names of husband and
wife are engraved on the visiting card, it is
proper that it should read, supposing that the
lad- is the wife of a captain in the army,
"Captain and Mrs. Robinson." Mrs. Captain
Robiuson would be in decidedly bad taste.
â¢rHE Right to Voteâ J. R. L., City. There is
no law that says that alien minors coming to
the United States shall have the right to vote
on attaining majority. The children of per
sons who have been duly naturalized, being
under the age of 21 years at the time
of the naturalization of their parents, shall, if
dwelling in the United States, be considered
as citizens thereof. Any alien under the age
of 21 years who has resided In the
United States three years uext preceding his
arriving at that age, and who has continued to
reside therein to the time he may make appli
cation to be admitted a citizen thereof, may,
after he arrives at the age of twenty-one years
ana after he has resided five years within the
United States, including the three years of his
minority, be admitted a citizen; but he must
mate a declaration on oath and prove to the
satisfaction of the court that for two years
next preceding it has been his bona fide in
tention to become a citizen.
To Rkmove the Marksâ W. E. 8., Oakland,
CaL A person who is troubled with tattoo
marks on the flesh should consult a dermatol
ogist bo that he may determine what method
is the best to remove them. The following pre
some of the methods employed to remove the
disfiguring marks: The operation is performed
by applying nitric acid with the stopper of the
bottle (a better instrument would be a glass
rod, pointed to carry the acid), just sufficient
to cover the stain, so as to avoid making a
larger scar than needed, the acid to remain
about a minute and a half until the cutis vera
is penetrated and a crusted appearance is
shown, then washed oft with clean, cold water
In a few days after this treatment a scab forms'
which contains the tattoo mark or stain; re
move it, and should inflammation supervene
poultice and bathe with warm water In this
way the skin with the stain ia not only re
moved almost painlessly, bui tne nitric acid
at the same time to a certain extent seems to
discolor the stain. Of course, large tattoo
marks extending over the surface must ne
cessitate the operation being performed differ

If there be any blessing in the gratification
Of the wish of Robert Burns, "to see oursels as
ithers see us," the American people of this
generation have a right to regard themselves
as among the blessed of the earth. The "itners"
who see us have been in no wise backward in
letting us know what they see or what they
think they see. So many observers, in fact,
have published their observations and their
judgments upon us, and these have been of
such variety and contrariety in tone, style,
intent and purpose, and of such diversity of
taste, talent and degree ot ability, that we may
fairly say of ourselves, like St. Paul, "I am a
debtor both to the wise and the unwise; both
to the Greeks and the barbarians."
One of the critics of our country and our
manners who must be classified among the
Greeks is S. C. de Soissons, whose newly pub
lished work, "A Parisian in America," has a
sufficiency of charm in its wit, grace and vi
vacity to make it a readable book to the gen
eral public If we do not regard it. as exactly
true of our characteristics, we will none the
less grant that it is amusing. There runs
through it, moreover, a little strain of origin
ality which implies that if the critic has not
been a profound student of America he has at
any rate been an acute observer, and has
noted certain traits of our society which have
not been noted by others. It may be, of
course, that these newly discovered traits do
nÂ«t exist among us, but that does not affect
the value of the book as a means ot entertain
ment. If M. de Soisgons did not discover
these novelties of American life he invented
them, and deserves credit for that.
The author announces in an introductory
chapter that he came to America not to study
its wealth, its democracy, its politics, its won
derful landscapes, its great cities or the char
acter of its statesmen, but its women. He
adds, very illogically, that the reason he came
to note woman particularly was because all
other features of the country have been so fre
quently described that no other work on any
of them is necessary; just as if the American
woman had not been blamed, praised, criti
cized and described about as often as anything
else in the country. â¢ Possibly, however, M. de
Soissons meant only that those who described
the country generally have done it justice,
while those who tried to describe the women
failed. In that case, of course, another book
was needed. After the chumps there Is always
a demand for the artist.
Having announced that he came to this
country to study the American woman, M. de
Soissons does not tantalize his readers by post
poning his judgment upon the object of his
study. At the close of his introductory chap
ter he says: "To my great satisfaction I
found the American woman not only fin de
siecle, but even more than that â fin de globe."
"A strange phenomenon which I have ob
served," says the author in the first chapter of
his book, "is that, notwithstanding her promi
nent position in the social life of this country,
woman does not occupy, as it seems, the same
great place in the hearts, minds, imagination
and passion of the -American artists and
poets." Following this assertion is a clever
contrast between American art and literature
and those of European nations, | and particu
larly those of France, in reference to women.
Very few American painters, we are told, have
attempted to depict the American woman.'and
those who have done so have avoided the nude
and aimed to display the beauty of her toilet
rather than of her body. It is added that this
strange phenomenon is observed also among
American sculptors or "statuaries,'.' as our
author calls them, and St. Gaudens, Kitson,
Proctor and Dallln are famous chiefly fpr their
works representing men and not women.
We may gather some idea of M. de Soissons'
estimate of American women of the East from
an artistic standpoint by his statement con
cerning the type of women painted by Thomas
W. Dewing. Of the work of this artist he says:
"He has lived for a time in New England and
those tall languid girls of Puritan descent,
entirely out of place in the prosaic, tight
buttoned, . Keep-up-your-appearance society,
have undoubtedly left a lasting impression on
him. Their long erect necks, blonde hair, pale,
wistful faces with prominent noses, and their
well-modeled lips must have a strange fascina
tion for the painter. Also as models they must
possess a peculiar charm.' Their build is firm
and round, mature around the hips, with un
developed busts, natural waist and an increased
length from hip to knee as a striking
peculiarity."
Turning from painting to poetry our critic
says : "I have before me a book entitled | 'Songs
of Three Centuries,' edited by John G. Whit
tier for the use of the American public. .The
volume contains several hundred . poetical
compositions of the renowned American
poets, bnt only a few, and those very tame and
insignificant poems, are inspired by women."
Even Longfellow's "Evangeline" is a tribute
to the sentiment of love rather than to woman,
for in the whole poem there Is no reference to
physical beauty except in the two lines:
Ah ! She was fair, exceedingly fair, to behold as she
stood with - â¢
Naked snow-white feet on the gleaming floor of her
chamber. .
M. de Solssons does not undertake to explain
why the American woman is neglected by the
artists and the poets of the country. He says
very frankly it must be considered one of those
strange things which can be accounted, for
only by referring it to some peculiarity of the
land in which one lives. He - adds, however,
that if art and poesy are careless of the Amer
ican woman, so is the American woman indif
ferent to love, sentiment and' romance. She
has, he says,' much head and little heart. "She
cares less to be beautiful than do the women in
certain European countries, but she wishes
much more to have brains. She is also more
susceptible of goodness, honesty and friend
ship." * . BSSBm
It is not easy to pack into a little space a di
gest of all -the Parisian has to say of * the
charming subject of his study. He makes of
the American woman, indeed, something fin
de siecle and fin de globe. In her life, we are
told, love plays very little part. i "The times, "
he says, "when the feeble and fair creatures,
stretched out in hammocks &nd couches,
dreamed of the spoony, pressings of 'hands'
which occurred to , them , days ; before have
passed away." It would seem from this that
our Parisian had never studied the summer
girl, but he quickly shows that he is not ig
norant of the role he plays at the seaside or
the mountains. The American woman, be
says, "loves more often and more quickly"
than th*e European. She delights to repeat.
I knew, I knew, it could not last. ' ..
Twm bright, 'twas heavenlyâ but 'tis past.
The artistic eye of â¢ M. de ; Bolssons- does not
altogether approve of our woman as a type of
beauty. He says she is not beautiful from a
sculptural point of view, but if a painter had a
magical palette be might make her beautiful.'
Her best charms are derived from the fact that
her father and mother united when young: in
a marriage for love, and have â  transmitted to
her the gifts which nature lavishes upon the
children of youth and' love. In addition to
this the mixture of races has given much to
the charm of the American woman, and "The'
Hibernian, French', Italian and German strains,
mingled in her veins with the blood of the An
glo-Snxon,have tempered' with vivacity or with
morbidezza, with grace or with languor,
the settled characteristics she has inherited
from hex ancestors. So one can find in this
country nearly every kind of plastic beautyâ
the voluptuous nonchalance of the Creole, the
aristocratic purity of lines of the English
woman, the expressive and changeable
physiognomy of the French woman, the
dazzling complexion of the Irish girl. From
these different nationalities she has borrowed
the characteristic excellence of each; youth
and love have done the work of elimination,
since, as we must remember, marriage in the
United States is the result of instinctive affinity
much more than in other countries."
If we find in these statements something of
contradiction we must remember that woman
is a contradictory subject and be not too
severe in our judgment of M. de Soissons. It
is not easy to write of the American woman
and write logically. Even our own authors
are unequal to that task. To praise her at one
moment and to condemn her at the next has
been the habit of man since the beginning of
the world, and De Soissons, though a Parisian,
is sufficiently human to be entitled to avail
himself of the privilege which by this time
may be accounted as an established right of
man.
When he had written his observations of our
women M. de Soissons went on to write his
opinion of our men, our art, music, architec
ture and literature. It is scarcely necessary
to say that in dealing with these subjects he is
neither so vivacious, so witty nor so enter
taining as in the first chapters of his book.
Like every other European he found that the
American man works too hard in his office,
and is too subordinate at home. He taken no
pleasure and neglects to educate his higher
faculties, the result being that he is distinctly
inferior to his wife in education and intellect
ual development, and is therefore regarded by
her as a creature intended only to support her
and provide her with money.
M. de Soissons declares we are improving
in art, architecture and music, but are declin
ing in literature. Like the rest of the world,
ne perceives we have lost Emerson, Longfel
low, Lowell, Whittier, Hawthorne, Bancroft,
Prescott, Holmes and Motley and have no one
to take their places. He finds it strange that
we should have sympathized with Germany
rather than with France in the war between
those two nations, but consoles himself in the j
belief that it was only a temporary aberration
of the intellect
Onr newspapers amaze him by the freedom
with which they publish the details ot private
life of prominent people, but he quotes approv
ingly the statement of a correspondent of
Figaro who visited Washington: "In point
of humbug, to tell the truth, ail newspaper
men are equal, Europeans as well as Ameri
cans. Newspaper men can be compared to
the chimneysweep, for with both, after all,
the main question is the drattâ it is the draw
ing power that makes success."
For one thing we owe our Parisian critic an
assorted variety of warm thanks. He tells us
that after he had written his first American
book, "Boston Artists," he was told by a friend,
"If you wish to meet with financial success
yon nrust write something practical, as the
silver question, for instance, because in
America art is considered a frivolous thing." |
M. de Soissons did not write on the silver ques- j
tion. He avoided frivolous things by writine |
about women, and we have thus been spared
another solution of the money, problem. In
the name of the people we give thanks. [Bos

THE PRINCE AND THE PAUPER.
A new library edition of one of Mark Twain's
better known books. While primarily written
as a story for boys and girls there is much in
the work that has proved attractive to readers
of larger growth.
The story deals with the adventures of a
poor London boy, Tom Canty, with
Edward VI of England at the time
when he was heir-apparent to the throne.
The young Prince insisted that the boy
change places with himâ that he assume the
royal insignia of office, which he obligintily re
signs.
The humorist appears to have drawn largely
upon his imagination in describing the every
day ceremonial of a king robing himself
in his everyday clothes. This function Mr.
Clemens describes in a manner strongly rem
iniscent of "The Gondoliers," and with a
minuteness worthy of Mr. Gilbert himself.
Instance:
"In the beginning a shirt was taken up by
the Chief Equerry in Waiting, who passed it
to the First Lord of the Buckhounds, who
passed it to the Second Gentleman of the Bed
chamber, who passed it to the Head Ranger
of Windsor Forest, who passed it to the
Third Groom of the Stole, who passed it to
the Chancellor Royal of the Duchy of Lancas
ter, who passed it to the Master of the Ward
robe, who passed it to the Norroy King-at-
Arms, who passed it to the Constable of the
Tower, who passed it to the Chief Steward of
the Household, who passed it to the Hered
itary Grand Dlaperer, who passed it to the
Lord High Admiral of England, who passed
it to the Archbishop of Canterbury, who
passed it to the First Lord of the Bed
chamber."
Without attempting to follow the London
Saturday Review, which reviewed the "Inno
cents Abroad" seriously es a work of travel (!)
there exists in our mind some little curiosity
regarding the source of Twain's data. We
imagine that neither Hume nor Green would
make himself responsible for picturing the
Archbishop of Canterbury in the charac
ter of a valet. Despite these little
drawbacks, born of a too fertile imagination,
â¢'The Prince and the Pauper" is a good story,
and it admirably succeeds in its attempt to
instil into the minds of tha American youth
a hatred ot customs which obtained in me
dieval Merrie England, at the same time
presenting a more or less correct view of the
same customs. [New York: Harper <fc Bros.

LITERARY NOTES.
Mrs. Stowe is thesubjeciof theleadingarticle
in the Critic of July 4â an appreciative study
by James Herbert Morse, the poet. The essay
was written years ago, when the famous author
of "Uncle Tom" lay at the point of death. For
years it stood in type, but in 1894 the matter
was "distributed." When newsoi Mrs. Stowe's
death was received the forms were already
made up; but as good fortune would have it
the leading article was of exactly the same
length as the paper on Mrs. Stowe, so that the
latter was readily put in its place. In the
same number of the Critic is an article on
"The Boy Poet of the East End," London,
whose portrait is printed, together with a
poem that justifies high hopes of his future
achievement. The lad, who is only 15 years
old, is employed in a factory.
There seems to he no end to the new ways of
celebrating the Fourth ot July. The Youth's
Companion special number this year bad three
stories of exciting celebrations, each of which
is different from any ordinary celebration.
This special issue is so attractive that every
member of the family will read it.
'â¢The Declaration of Independence in the I
Light of Modern Criticis.n," by Moses Coit
Tyler, professor of history in Cornell Uni
versary, possesses a well-considered timeliness
as the opening article in the North American
Review for July. Professor Tyler discusses
this venerable and "classic statement of po

ways in a loyal and patriotic spirit.
Thomas Hardy writes to the Critic to deny a
Charge of plagiarism made by one of the cor
respondents of that paper in 1882 and ignored
till now. He says that be has never seen
Judge Longstreet's "Georgia Scenes," from
which he was accused of copying a descrip
tion of a militia drill in "The Trumpet
Major," of which a new edition has just ap
peared. He was, however, indebted to Gif-
ford's History of the War with Napoleon (Lon
don, 1820), and it would seem highly probable
that the American author had drawn from
the same 6ource. With this number the Critic
closes its twenty-eighth volume.
Mrs. Mabel Osgood Wright, who has written
one of the ben field-books of New England
birdsâ "Birdcraft," published by the Macmil

A tale of Washington life, told by two lead
ing characters, is Harriet Riddle Davis' new
novel, "In Sight of the Goddess." Stephen
Barradale (whose only ambition in youth was
to grow up to be a streetcar driver, and whose
stumbling block in that career was his inde
cision whether to run a car on F street or on
the avenue), had become a sort of polite
lackay, at a yearly salary, to wealthy people
who were desirous of being introduced into
Washington society. Horatio Childs accepts a
cabinet position, brings his family to the
capital, and looks about for a private secre
tary â one whose people are of social impor
tance. He finds Barradale, whose father was
an admiral in the navy, and employs him.
Childs has a daughter, Constance, and
she is the goddess of Barradale's dreams.
The two young people have the usual
misgivings and trials, and finally Barradale,
concluding his suit in vain, gets a commission
from Secretary Childs to go West on business.
He is thinking of remaining West, when he
finds between the leaves of one of Childs' let
ters a "Parable of a Foolish Virgin," which
Constance had written, and whleh explains
everything so satisfactorily that Barradale
loses no time in returning to Washington and
happiness. The story is interestingly written.

THE VANIS.IED EMPEROR.
The story with the above title, by Percy
Andreae, purports to reveal some hitherto hid
den history regarding Emperor Willibald's
strange disappearance from men's view dur
ing the early part of his reign, and to throw
light on "the Emperor's purpose in vanishing
completely" for so long a period. The book
winds up by the Emperor's sudden reap
pearance, whereat he begins to make his
power felt in the world; dismisses his chan
cellor, whose services had long been deemed
indispensable to the Government and treads all
over obsolete customs and useless forms.
As tbe author himself says, the romance is
built up on tÂ» mosaic of fact and fiction, and it
has a deal to do with European diplomacy and
court intrigue. He has invented transparently
fictitious names for the personages whose
share in the events described is more or less
based on assumed facts. For instance, the
Emperor Willibald of Arminia means none
other than Kmperor William of Germany; the
Duke of Curnbermere is the Duke of Cumber
land; Franconia is France; Brandenburg,
Prussia; Noveria, Hanover; Prince Otto
roarck, Prince O:to yon Bismarck, etc.
The claim is made that everything that
is true of Emperor William II of Germany is
also true of Emperor Willibald of Armiula,
while not all that is true of the Ar
minian Willibald can be said to be
true of the German William 11. The
famous diplomat, Sir John Templeton, fig
ures prominently in the story, which contains
a real episode in Sir John's extraordinary
career. It is opined by Mr. Andreae that {hose
readers who are acquainted with the inner
history of the present dynastic relations of
Germany, which are the outgrowth of the his
torical events of the last forty years, may
recognize even in tho^e incidents of the story
which apparently fly in the face of ail histori
cal facts a certain substratum of actuality that
may claim, so to speak, to be at least "a color
able imitation of the truth." [Chicago: Rand,
McNally & Co., publishers.]
A CAPTURE BY MARRIAGE.
A delightful story is this romance of tl .. day
by Robert Buchanan, published in the Lotus
Library series. It is full of surprises to the
reader, who is happily deceived as to the out
come. Catherine Powers, an heiress, is sought
after by a throng of admirers; but she enjoys
freedom too well to permit the question of
marriage to trouble her. Her cousin, Patrick
Blake, who should by birth have inherited the
fortune that Catherine possesses, makes love
to her not merely on account of the wealth,
but because he really loves his kins
woman. Catherine resents his advances,
ami Patrick swears that no other man shall
marry her. Suddenly Catherine is kidnaped,
and her whereabouts remains a mystery for
several days. Patrick is arrested on suspicion,
but is dismissed when a word comes from the
heroine that he ts no way to blame for her dis
appearance. Patrick suspects one Philip
Langford of causing his arrest, and swears, to
get even. Catherine Keeps secret the story of
her four days of absence, even the parish priest
failing In his efforts to get her to tell all and
defend her character from evil rumors. She
left tome again, for a time, against the
priest's advice, depositing a written con
fession with him, however. After her de
parture, Langford, whom sne had refused to
see, was broken-hearted. The story was made
that he was the real kidnaper, and
that he had taken Catherine prisoner in the
hope of getting her consent to marriage. Once
Catherine had told Langford that in the old
days marriage by capture was far more satis
factory than the present system; so he took
her at her word and strove to win her by force.
Soon the word reached Catherine that Lang
ford had been shot by an unknown person in
the hills. She returned ie time to hear the
wounded man telling the priest how dearly he
loved Catherine, and how he wished she could
hear his dying protestations. Catherine steps
in, her eyes full of sympathy's tears, and de
clares her willingness to marry the man who
captured her, and Langford recovers with as
tonishing rapidity. [Philadelphia: J. B. Lip

ADAM JOHNSTONE'S SON
The name of F. Marion Crawford Inscribed
on the title-page of a novel has come to be
regarded both in this country and across the
water as a guarantee of excellence. His admit
ted power as a writer has done much to eradi
cate or nullify that prejudice which certain
critics hesitated not to express against the
"American novel." Those who are aware of
the finish and the depth of analysis exhib
ited by the author of "The Ralstons" in much
of his work will welcome the latest effort ot his
pen. It is entitled "Adam Johnstone's Son."
The story is a romantic one, with the scene
laid in Italy. Unlike most of Mr. Crawford's
other Italian stories, however, the principal
characters in the work are English, and the
action of the tale runs on with almost rhyth
mic smoothness. There are, too, numerous
passages that are forceful and which the reader
is tempted to preserve for future reference.
Here is one, indicating a close study of the
habits of nations:
"There is something almost phenomenal
about an Englishman's stolid self-satisfaction
when he is alone with his pipe. Every man
has bis own way of smoking. There is a hasty
and vicious manner about the Frenchman's
little cigarette of pungent black tobacco. The
Italian dreams over his rat-tail cigar. The
American either eats half of his Havana while
he smokes the other or else he takes a frivol
ous delight in smoking delicately and keeping
the white ash whole to the end. The German
surrounds himself with a cloud, and, god-like
meditates within it. There is a sacrificial ait
about the Asiatic's narghileh as tbe thin spire
rises steadily and spreads above his head. Its
simplicity is Gotnic; its solidity Is of the stone
age. He smokes it in tbe face of thÂ« higher
civilization and it is the badge of the con
queror."
We quote a singularly beautiful paragraph
from an early chapter of "Adam Johnstone'B
Son," showing what a master of the art of sen
timental writing Mr. Crawford is:
"Every woman knows the calendar of her
own face. The lines are years, one for such
and such a year, one for such and such an
other. The streaks are months, perhaps, or
weeks, or sometimes hours, where the tear
storms have bleached the brown, the black
or the gold. 'This little wrinkleâ it was
so very little then!' she says. 'It came
when I doubted for a day. There is a
shadow there, just at each temple, where the
cloud passed, when my sun went out. The
bright hair grew lower on my forehead. It is
worn away, as though by a crown that was not
of gold. There are hollows there, near the
ears on each side, since that week when love
was done to death before my eyes, and diedâ
intestateâ leaving his substance to be divided
among; indifferent heirs. They wrangle for
what he has left, but he himself is gone be
yond hearing or caring, and, thank God, be
yond suffering. But the marks are left.' "
"Adam Johnstone's Son" is fully up to the
high standard set by the author to himself in
"Casa Braccio"and "Sauf Ilario," and it will,
without doubt, be so accounted by readers of
standard fiction. [New York: Mac mil lan <fe

JERRY THE DREAMER.
In this novel Will Payne, the author, paints
a man who dreams, whose lack of logical power

I this man's name. He goes to Chicago from a

j He meets Georgia House, daughter of a rich
j jurist, and elopes with her. After they are

I wife's cousin, Sidney Bane, and at the same
| time begins to develop socialistic theories. He
; drifts away from his wife, loses his job, em
\ barks in a socialistic newspaper scheme and
i fails, and finally, utterly down - hearted, he
seeks out his wife again and they are recon
ciled. Jerry seems to wake up to life's reali
ties toward the end. [New York: Harper &

CAMILLA.
This is a translation from both the Danish
and Swedish of Richert yon Koch. The name
of the translator is not given, but, whoever ho
may be, he has done his work well.
"Camilla" is a novel of society life in Sweden
and may be calculated upon to cause a senss
tion in America, considering the fact that it
deals in phases and experiences heretofore
little written of. The scene is laid in Stock
holm. The heroine, who lends her name to
the story, is a fascinating Danish girl whose
views on matters doctrinal and religious
startle the friends and family by whom she is
surrounded. She is advanced in her ideas,
but even those who are tempted to criticize
her latitudinarianism of thought and action
cannot fail to see that her heart is of gold.
Certain scenes in "Camilla" are very power
fully written and appear to have lost none of
the fire of the original. There is, besides this,
a simplicity about the book that is charming.

J. E. Becker of 47 Russ street this City
has returned from, a long exploring ex
pedition through Northwestern 'Washing
ton. He was away from settlements al
most two years. He pronounces the coun
try a true terra incognita. He says all
descriptions of the country that he has
seen are faulty and misleading. A recent
account of un expedition which entered
the country in the fall, and returned in
the soring with stories ot hardship and
wonderful discoveries, he characterizes as
wholly inadequate and uncertain.
Mr. Becker was accompanied by J. C.
Burke, Frank Jones, William Pool, Henry
Wechter and B. C. Williams. The party
was seeking for gold, and Becker claims
that they found it in paying quantities.
Just where he does not choose to say to
the public. At any rate they have formed
the Hurricane Hi'l Mining Company.
One of their number remains in the
mountains and the others have scattered.
Williams, the engineer and surveyor of
the expedition, has returned to San Jose,
where his father is president or superin
tendent of the city water works.
"It is something of a wonder," said Mr.
Becker yesterday, "that in this country
of pioneers and adventurous spirits a ter
ritory so large, so beautiful and so bounti
ful shonld have remained to this day
within our borders practically unknown.
But so it is.
"Between Puget Sound on the east and
the Straits of Juan de Fuca on the north,
the Pacific Ocean on the west and a line
drawn westward from Tacoma to the
ocean on the south there is a country as
large as the State of Massachusetts, where
there is magnificent timber, coal and iron
and preat reaches of grazing country, and
iish and game without limit. When 1 tell
people of what I saw up there they do not
believe me. So what is the use?
"We started into the country from Port
Angeies and followed the county road
south to the Government trail. The Gov
ernment trail is a path blazed by Govern
ment engineers many years ago from Port
Angeles on the Straits of Fuca to Grays
Harbor. The trail begins at the Elwah
River, twelve miles south of Port Angeles.
We followed the trail over the first range
of mountains and then struck off, blazing
our own trail southward to Hurricane Hill.
"We parsed through forests of fir, yellow
pine, hemlock, red cedar and Alaska
cedar â a very hard wood. We crossed over
two ranges of mountains, the south slope
of each of which was covered with lux
uriant blue bunch grass of an excellent
nutritious quality. The north slope of the
mountains was more barren and toward
the top was covered with snow. The
Un ocr extended within a quarter of a miie
of the top. In the valleys the grass grew
knpe-deep, while the tops of the moun
tains are wide plateaus covered with a
sort of iir bru&h. And all this vast area
remains yet uninvaded by the cattleman
or sheepherder. It is wonderful to me
that it is so, considering how men stam
peie into far less fertile regions when
taken from the Indians of the plains and
sheepherders are quarreling over each I
other's claims just east of the Cascades.
"The ascent from Elwah River to the j
mountain top is so gradual as to be scarcely
noticeable. After traveling for a long
time with very little labor we looked ba^k
to discover to our surprise that we were
far above the river. The timber there is
wonderfully open and free from under
growth. We could see long distances in j
all directions through the woods. The j
trees are immense. We cut down a cedar \
that measured 300 feet.
"Game of every sort was most plentiful. ;
There were black bears, cougars and a large
gray wolf almost the size of a Newfound
land dog. This seems to be the last resort
of the elk, and from the manner with j
which it is slaughtered it will not remain j
long there. We found an animal whicn I !
had never before seen. I have looked it j
up in the books, but have been unable to
find any exact description of it. There is
an animal called the mermit which an- !
swers something of its description. We j
found it only above the timber line in the j
mountains. It is about the size of a pug- !
dog. It lives in holes, dug stiaight down- j
ward, and is almost never seen except as j
it sit* on the edge of the hole. It whistles j
like a mau and deceived ns contiuuaily.
As we passed along the trail we could hear
this whistle, as of some man hailing us.
Turning, we would, if the conditions were
right, discover the little whistling mer
mit, as we have agreed to call it, sitting j
perfectly motionless above its nest. If we i
moved on he would hail us again with hh
sharp, shrill cry. If we shot at him the
bullet must kill instantly we would lose
him, for if he had one kick of life remain
ine it would drop him into his hole. We
caught quite a number, however, and
found them very fine eating. The animal
! has a long fur, which is very fine. It is
| very fat and yields an excellent oil. There j
were great quantities of game birds, grouse j
and pheasants in particular, and the j
i streams were filled with fish.
"On the north slope of the second range
of mountains we found two glaciers,
which were ten miles across and contain
ing crevasses into which you could drop a
house.
"We found several mineral springs con
taining iron and sulphur water, which
even the horses seemed to like.
"Our first definite stop out from Port
Angeles was at a place called Death Val
ley. It is on the Government trail, and is
a desolate and depressing place. The next
was at Starvation Flat, 4500 feet up the
i mountain. It was markfd and so named
by the Government engineers. From there
! we moved on to Government Pass over
| the mountains, to where we finally located
and remained. We found in our prospect
, ing a veritable mountain of iron. After
: ward we located what we consider a very
1 valuable lead of gold and silver ore, which
we are making arrangements to work."

FO^Esypy sxajion
The Forestry Station at Santa Monica, in j
Southern California, occupies a most in- .
teresting and picturesqus site. The town, \
Santa Monica, is perhaps as well known as ;
any part of the California seacoast. because ;
it is particularly accessible from Los An-;
geles by railroad, and has become the
leading watering-place between Coronado
and Monterey. A long sweep of seashore,
bold, hizh cliffs, and an almost level plain
above them, ris:ng north and northeast to ,
the bluest of mountain ranges, and tray- |
ersed by deep barrancas, or straight-sided ;
canyons â such is the general aspect of the
great Santa Monica Rancho. Fifty years
ago, 100,000 acres here, the estate of an old
; Spanish pioneer, supported vast herds of
horses and cattle. Then came the railroad
and the American town-builders.
The greatest and deepest barranca in
; this entire Santa Monica plain is that
known as the Santa Monica Canyon. It
! is not really a canyon in the strict inter
pretation of the Spanisa word, which re
fers to mountain ravines, but more nearly
'â  conforms to the Spanish idea of a bar
: ranca â a wide cleft across the plains from
i the mountains to the sea. In reality,
! there are two large barrancas there, run
i niug in a direction somewhat parallel for
! fo*tr or five miles, although they are some
! times close together and at other times
i wide apart. The narrow tongue of and
between them extends to within an eighth
of a mile of the ocean. The two streams
j that flow through these deep and well
wooded depressions unite at the foot of
this gradually sloping tongue of land that
overlooks the sea beaches. Here, on the
sides and summit of this narrow, central
plateau, between two deep gorges, the
Santa Monica Forestry Station is situated.
It is almost completely bidder from the
town and the watering-place. It is greatly
sheltered from storms, and yet the view
from its heights is wonderfully extensive.
The twenty acres belonging to the For
estry Station, a lit Ile arboretum trÂ«ct, with
hardly any waste upon it, extends from
the bottom of the northern Santa Monica
Canyon, tip slopes and across levels to the
very top of the'TOesa, on the same plane as
the town itself, and looks down from
there to the bottom of .the south canyon.

Old Sires arvd Their
Quests
The origin of the midsummer high jinks
in the majestic redwoods is not veiled in
mystery. Since the first outing of the Bo
iiemian Club, which took place in July,
187S, the magazines and newspapers of
two continents Wave published and illus
trated stories of the Biinimer festival of
Bohemia. Fred M. Somers and Frank M.
Pixley described the outing scenes for the
Argonaut. Harper's Monthly reproduced
Tavernier's celebrated cartoon of the sec
ond Guerneville jinks, sired by James F.
Bowman, one of the founders of the
club. To Harper's Weekly Henry J.
Brady and Marcus P. Wiggin con
tributed articles descriptive of the
doings in the redwoods. The fame of the
jinks has spread abroad until every scrap of
intelligence regarding its origin and action
is eagerly sought for. Gertrude Atherton
in one of her novels depicts the scene as
she saw it as a summer guest at Cazadero.
The Bohemian Club was a very lively
institution after it moved from the
original quarters on Sacramento street, at
the corner of Webb, to the "spacious
apartments" over the California market
on Pine street. New members came in and
as the rooms were all on tho
same floor companionships were readily
formed. The recruits were as eager as the
veterans to promote high-jinks revels, and
so when the suggestion came to give an
all-night picnic or an outdoor jinks as a
send-off to Harry Edwards, who was then
breaking away irom old-time associations
at the California Theater to try his for
tunes in the Atlantic cities the club
thought something novel should be done
to testify its regard for Harry.
Surely no one had done more for
the club from its infancy until that
time than Harry Edwards. Tnomas
Newcomb, one of the early city editors of
The Cat.l. and the first president of the
club, had perhaps done quite as much for
the institution as the eenial actor, but the
latter, while not jealous or unwilling to
acknowledge the worth of others, still
clung to the cherished faith that he was
nearer and dearer to the hearts of Bo-
I hernia by reason of devoted service to her
cause than any other man.
Recurring to the all-night picnic Frank
Pixley wanted it to take place on the La
gunitas, I. Gutte had a plan for a Sausalito
â  outing aboard the yachts. Joseph Tilden,
! Fred Somers and Hugh Burke were in
favor of a far-away, secluded place in the
! forest.
The subject was discussed all around,
but as Mr. Tilden was chief of subsistence
he determined to establish his camp near
a base of supplies known as Taylor's sum
| mer hotel, on Paper mill Creek.
The outinc was a success, but some
I schoolteachers and other demure campers
who had pitched their tents in that region
i for summer solace hardly knew what to
: think of the night proeramrne. There was
â  a high jinks, it is true, but there was no
i platform or music, other than vocal chorus.
j A cam pfire wa9 lighted and around itgath
j ered the club members. Harry Edwards
j was the central figure. His talk was pa
j thetic and full of the poetry inspired by
! the sublimity of the forest. luore than
! that, he was impressed by the dissolution
I of the old California Theater Company
| and his separation from John McCullough,
i Barton Hill, Stephen Leach. Thomas
| Keene, William Mestayer, Walter Leman
I and others of the famous organization.
He was going East to recast his lot in
life among strangers. Harry Edwards,
with all of his excellent qualities, could
cush, and when once started in this direc
| tion no one could outgush him. Tlsecamp
i fire scene took a sympathetic bent, but joy
reigned in the precincts of the bar not
far distant. Charles Warren Stoddard,
the poet, was there, and he was quite as
sad as Harry Edwards, and quite as poet
j ical in his sadness. Dr. Swan prescribed
i a special punch for the jinke, as the mcl
', nncholy seemed to be deepening, and
; Joseph D. Strong was delegated to mix the
i ingredients of the beverage. The memory
jof that punch was not obliterated. It still
lives in Strong's cartoon of the first mid
summer high jinks.
The first outing on Paper-mili Creek
was successful. The second high jitiks, a
year later, amonn the great redwood forest
trees was not only a success, but it was a
revelation. Preparations were made in
due time for trantportation by special
train and (or subsistence and shelter.
Hugh M. Burke was appointed sire, and
Joseph Tilden superintended the commis
sary department. John W. Taylor, the
I Superintendent of Schools, Theodore P.
\ Payne, Walter G. Holmes and Dr. Benja
! mm Swan constituted a committee, along
with the sire and Mr. Tilden, to select a
site.
An amphitheater or space, covered with
towering trees of the largest size and
high walled by a densely wooded canyon,
was found on the south side of the Rus
sian River, a mile or more from Duncan's
> Mills. A short distance from the camp a
i stream of water tumbling down ledges of
the rock made a beautiful cascade in the
i forest, and when Jules Tavernier had the
â¢ cascade illuminated with lanterns the ef
fect was encnanting.
Several days in advance Joseph Tilden
procured the necessary supplies, and, tak-
I ing with him a corn of helpers, promised
| a good dinner, served by the club, on the
arrival of the train with the jinks crowd.
Every club has its kickers, and the kickers
, said the journey to the Russian River,
| twice the distance of the previous year's
journey, was too great; that no food could
be obtained, and that the whole thing
would prove a dismal failure. The train,
with a hundred members or more, arrived
0.1 time.
The march through the woods a half
mile to camp disclosed forest scenes new
and wonderful to many of the party.
When the selected amphitheater was
reached the members of the advance com
mittee were bailed as heroes. The magni
tude of the giant trees of the forest,
their stately symmetry and solemn maj
esty caused a feeling of reverence to min
gle with the sentiment of admiration.
Joe Tilden was the hero of the night.
The dinner that ho berved was delicious.
The onion *oup of the breakfast became
historic. The night scene was of surpass
ing beauty. The artists Jules Tavernier,
Toby Rosenthal and Julian Rix were in
ecstacy. The cartoon to commemorate
the event, to picture the trees, thÂ« cascade
and the general scene was to be a joy for
ever. Sketches were made of the cascade
and the striking incidents of the jinks;
but so many artists were doing the work
that the cartoon was never finished, and
on the walls of the Bohemian Club no rec
ord can be found of this early but famous
midsummer high jinks.
John W. Taylor has some of the original
sketch*! made by Toby Rosenthal, and
there is in some place the original sketch
of the illuminated cascade by Tavernier
The sire'f subject was "As You Like It,"
and one of the chief contributors was John
F. Swift.
The members were reluctant to leave
the famous strove. Many were so enthusi
astic that a meeting was called and quite
a sum of money subscribed to purchase
the property for the club.
It was then and there resolved to hold
all the midsummer jinks in the cascade
forest, but when the committee went to
look at the place a year later all the trees
had been cut away. Only a forest of
stumps and the cascade remained.
A grove equal in beauty, with the ad
vantage of a softer climate, was found for
the third jinks in 1880. The crowning suc
cess of the preceding jinks in the Russian
River had silenced all the kickers.
No resistance has since been offered to
the annual outing, and it is significant
that all the outings since have been held
in the Russian River belt, with the eicf.p
lion of one departure, Fred Somers' Buddha
jinks in Mill Valley. The first jinks at
the Guerneville forest was sired by General
W. H. L. Barnes and the second there by
James F. Bowman.
It was in the Guernevilie forest that
IN THE HEART OF BOHEMIA.
Fred M. Somers introduced the idea of the
cremation of Care, which Tavernier's fa
mous painting so accurately illustrates.
This was the fourth jinks of the midsum
mer series in the woods.
To the regular order from the beginning
the series was sired: Harry Edwards,
1878; Hugh M. Burke, 1879; W. H. L.
I Barnes, 1880; James F. Bowman, 1881;
George T. Bromley, A. G. Hawes. 1882;

Arnold, 1891; F. M. Somers, 1892; Joseph
D. Redding, 1893; Peter Robertson, 1894;
Vanderlynn Stow, 1895.
Among the artists whose cartoons com
memorate jinks in the woods may be men
tioned J. D. Strong, Jules Tavernier,
1 | Barfchaus, John Stanton, A. Jouillin,
â¢ Latimer, Thomas Hill and Julian Rix.
F. Marion Wells, sculptor, constructed
of gunny-bags and plaster the statue oi
1 the patron saint of Bohemia which stood
I three years in Meekar's Grove. He made
also the Buddha figure for the jinks in
1 Mill Valley, where a grove was, in fact,
' | purchased.
' From its inception the midsummer
! high jinks has been a growing institution.
â¢ In its development the artists in music
' have been active and efficient. Stephen
> L<-ach and Ben Clark in the early days
1 gained special recognition. Joseph D.
' Redding and H. J. Stewart coming later
' made music a leading feature. The club
â¢ quartet and chorus of the early outinps
' were succeeded in time by the complete
orchestra and the full band.
Nowadays special trains and boats are
1 engaged for the Bohemians. Instead of
â¢ tents for a night the camp is established
â¢ for a month. In the forest for weeks pre
" ceding the annual event "the nights are
" filled with music" and no cares infest the

yV Picturesque Bit of Jteture That

Gontinent to

To the lover of the wild and picturesque
in nature, a trip down the Russian River
o "Bohemia"â the grove of redwoods just
out from the old mill town of Guerne
villeâis well worth crossing a continent
to see. This noble congregation of coni
fersâSequoia seinpervirenoâ is altogether
the most magnificent forest accessible by
railroad from San Francisco, the trip there
and back being made in one day, with
three vast noon hours to wander at will in
"God's first temples." The entire way
from Santa Rosa, a distance of twenty-five
miles, is one of unimazined beauty
broken hillcliains set to orchard and vine
yard or left to nature's unpruned forestry,
and canyon and vale between, green with
hop gardens or scented haycocks bulging
to the sun.
A little beyond the town and tbe track
skirts a dizzy wall which overlooks a
sweeping curve of river. The rails qg.
ahead make steely ribbons through the
tutted grass and blowing wild oats. vVe
have left behind the dwellings of men,
but the house of an eagle is made out
high up on the topmost spire of a splint
ered pine â an "airy cartload of fagots" â
near which, on a bare limb, we discover
one of the nestlings preening its feathers
in the sun. The "chopped-out" district is
now wholly passed, and we experience
the indescribable exhilaration that comes
with the sight of primeval woods. And
such woods, pine and fir, and, kingliest of
all, the redwood, towering in unscathed
majesty. A mountain covered with these
giant conifers is inconceivably sublime,
and no words can depict tae solemn im
pressivenejs of a deep gorge fiiled with the
black, upright shafts. Never do I behold
these matchless trees without an instinc
tive stretching out of my arms in greeting.
The end of the track is the gateway to
Bohemia proper, the central group of red
woods belonging to a reserved tract of
ten acres. It is the chosen grounds for the
! annual jinks of the Bohemian Club, and
from this fact derives its name. A grander
i grove cannot be pictured. The columnar
! trees are maishaled on a level depression
of glen, with a margin of precipitous
mountain sides. Glimpses of these cir
cling walls, seen through the somber
shade, are like the stained windows in
some splendid cathedral â bo rich and
varied is the coloring. One arched hill
space shows the twisted red of madrono
outlined on a ground of varnished laurel.
Another is a rock face painted with
metallic oxides and veined with white
quartz; then a bank superbly noduled
with moss and lichens, a briery patch
snnbnrnisbed, a stucco of wild flowers, and
everywhere an exquisite tracery of poison
oak â Rbus toxicodendron â on a dark sur
face of bark.
The redwoods of Bohemia are not so
large as those of the Montgomery woad in
Mendocino, but they are colossal enough
to inspire reverent awe in the beholder.
The largest measures fifty feet in circum
ference, and, like all its fellows, the short,
bristling limbs do not begin for nearly a
hundred feet up tbe bole. While our feet
pressed soundlessly on the russet leaf mats
we drank in the balsamic air like a cor
dial, and for the time being shared the
vigor and perennialaess of these living
towers.
Who shall put into words tbe penetrat
ing hush and immortal tenderness of the
redwoods, where nature seems ever at
prayer or too profoundly happy to break
the stillness save by the faint tinkle of
water dropping over the smoothed round
ness of stones or the soft stir of an occa
sional songless bird? The usual feathered
or furry creature snuns the perpetual twi
light of the redwoods, and if found there
has no voice for greeting. Only enormous
slugs make iridescent trails over the moist
leaves underfoot.
There were ferns of various species in
the grove, but no flowers except a faded
pink oxalis, which invariably grows under
the sequoia. Where a streamlet loses it
self in a reedy dip a tiny lake is formed,
its bosom floating a variety of semi
aquatic vegetation. Ninetta Kamf.s.Text not availableText not availableIn fhijdhdjdsitefm

K6^6]R JBRlGrit;
BY REV. JOHN A. CASB.
A certain well-known Boston lawyer sat
at his desk in his office in Barristers' Hall
not long ago, busily engaged in making
out papers for an important real-estate
transfer, when there came a rap at the
door, and on his invitation to come in a
lad of about 12 years of age entered and
inquired whether he Lad any waste paper
to sell.
He was a man who took a great interest
in boys, and was fond of asking them ques
tions in his own sbrewd way, to find out
what metal they were made of.
Many a little bootblacK and street-gamin
has been roused to new thoughts by his
questions and words of counsel, and per
haps will owe their success in life to the
start he gave them.
He was, besides, a man of economical and
methodical habits, who never allowed any
thing to go to waste or be out of its place.
In answer to the boy's question he said,
"Perhaps so," and laying down his pen he
pulled out a huge drawer at his left hand
and showed quite a large quantity of
scraps.
The would-be merchant looked at it for
a moment, and then running his hand
down on either side of the drawer ap
peared to be estimating the probable
weight of the paper.
"You can have that for 25 cents," said
the lawyer.
Again the boy lifted it. turned his eves
to the ceiling, as if in calculation, and
i then shook his head as he replied:
"No, sir. I will allow you 15 cents for
the lot."
"Agreed," said the lawyer.
And the boy at once began to transfer
tbe paper from the drawer to his bag.
When he had removed the last piece
from the drawer and had picked up the
last bit from the floor he tied up his bag
and placed it near the door, and then
quietly remarked that he could not pay
for it just then.
"What!" exclaimed tbe lawyer, not a
little Burprbed, and perhaps a little pro
voked at such coolness. "No money to
pay for it? And how do you expect to buy
paper without money?"
For a moment the lad was frightened at
JKe Performance of jMr. Wiry Legs
the lawyer's manner and was at a loss to
know just what to say.
But if the lawyer was angry at first that
feeling disappeared when he saw the boy's
embarrassment, and, in a changed voice,
he inquired:
"Do you consider your note good, my
lad?"
"Yes, sir," replied the little fellow.
"Very well; if your note is good, I'd
just as soon have that as the money ; but,
mind you, if it isn't good, I don't want
it."
The boy affirmed that, if he gave a note,
he should certainly pay it. So the lawyer
produced a formidable sheet of "legal
cap" drew up a note for 15 cents, payable
at his office at some unspecified time in
the future.
The boy signed it in legible characters
and then shouldering liis bag of paper he
politely said, "Good-morning, tir," and
then trudged off.
c. B.
The lawyer laid the note away carefully,
supposing it would some time be a curi
osity, for he thought it wouldn't be paid;
but a surprise was in store for him.
That afternoon as he sat absorbed in the j
mysteries of Blackstone he heard a smart
rap on his door, and as he opened it in :
stepped the little paper- merchant of the
morning.
Removing his cap, he walked straight j
up to the desk and announced that he had
come to pay his note.
The note was produced, ana, as the law
yer held it in his hand, he leaned back in
his chair and said:
"Well, my lad, this is the first time I
ever knew a note to be paid on the same
day it was given. That is what I call
promptness in attending to business. In
my opinion, a boy who -will do that is
entitled to the note and the money, too." I
And, so saying, he banded the boy the
note and declined the money that had
been placed on the desk.
It was now the boy's turn to be sur
prised. He didn't catch the meaning, but
stood looking first at the note and then at
the money, as though saying to himself,
"They can t both belong to me.
"Yes," broke in the lawyer, 'they are
both yours. You have been so prompt to
keep your word and pay the note that you
may keep the money and I'll give you the
note."
A sadden gleam of light spread over the
boy's face as be put the money ami the
note in his Docket, and with a hearty
"Thank you, sir!" he turned and left the
room, carrying a light heart.
Of that boy's business future there can
be no question. He will, if life and health
are spared, make a great success. He has
three essential elements of success about
him.
First. Pie will do business. If he can't
do what he would like to. he will do what
comes to hand. He was not ashamed to
buy and sell waste paper.
Secondly. He will attend promptly to
whatever business he may have on hand.
His notes will never go to protest, but will
be met when due.
Thirdly. He highly estimates bis honor.
Perhaps the lawyer might never have
known him after that note was sicned.
Had he tried to collect the note be could
not have found the boy in that great city.
But he had given the note and, besides,
had assured the lawyer that it was good
and now he must pay it or his honor is
tarnished forever.
That boy keeps his honor bright â the
snre passport to all success worth having.
Any other boy can do as much. It mat
ters little how poor he may be at the start ;
with industry and honor he will succeed.
One of the wealthiest and most nobly
useful men about New York City was a
penniless lad. But ne bad a high sense of
honor, and he had indefatigable industry,
so that once, when he had made a promise
to pay $2 toward the building of a church
and saw no other way to eet it, he earned
it by catching moskrats and selling their
skins. Now he gives his thousands and
enjoys it.
Many who are now merchant princes in
all our great cities began life in poverty
and obscurity. But they had honor, and
that i 3 good capital â better than money.
Let a boy start out with such a regard
for honor that it will lead him to tell the

truth under every circumstance in which
he may be placed â a regard for his word,
which makas that word as good as his
note of hand, and his note as good as his
life â and he will find friends worth having
in hours when friends are most needed,
and he will never know what it means to
fail. â Golden Days.'
The promising work of a thirteen-year

Mina is not a little girl, as you might
suppose by the name, but a snowy white
parrot, who talks from morning till night.
She had been given to Nellie on her
eighth birthday by her uncle, and soon
became a great pet with all tbe household.
One day her little mistress came up be-
Eide her cage and saW: "Now, Mina, I'm
goins: away far off on a journey. I'm po
ing to be away for a fortnight, and I wish
you to be a good birdie and not say any
naughty words while I'm gone."
''"Never," promptly answered the parrot,
as she cocked her head on one side, as
| much as to say, "I'il never break that
j promise."
Bessie ar\d Her Baby ir\ tke Comer
"Very well," cried Nellie, "I'll trust
you; and now good-by, birdie, dear."
"Good-day, ma'am," was Mina's parting
remark, as she shut one eye.
Of course this made Nellie laugh all the
way down the stairs and through the hall.
Why, even after she had taken her seat in
the waiting cab her mother and father
were amused by the funny little giggles
and chuckles that came from her rosy lips.
Time passed very slowly with poor Mina.
There she had to stay, day after day, shut
up in a cage; let out, once in awhile, when
doors and windows were all closed, be
cause once, shortly after she became the
property of Nellie, she flew out, of her cage
into the garden. Her heart-broken mis
tress hunted for her a long, long time, and
was just about to give up in despair when
a terrible cry was borne to her ears.
"Nellieâ Nellie! Helpâ help!"
The little girl ran as fast as she could
1o the spot whence the cry came, and
there found her great dog Rover mount
ing guard over "poor poll." Mina had
been a prisoner in her cage so long that
she was almost powerless when the big
dog chased her. After Nellie's sending
Rover away in disgrace Mina was carried
to her cage once more, and great care has
been taKen that she goes on no more voy
ages of discovery.
Now we go back to the day Nellie went
away. Well, the parrot got along just
beautifully until lunch time, but when
nursey brought in her food â whew I jlm
iuy! what a fuss she raised.
"Nellie, Nellie, where is Nellie? Nellie
sick? Nellie come!"
Nursey tried to explain, but Mina would
not listen, and just kept crying, "I want
Nellie. I do, I do!"
Time flew very rapidly with Nellie, who
was visitins her auntie in a pretty little
country place, the wasn't ahui np in a
cage, oh, no! From morning till night
she was going â nshing, black Derrying,
boating and swimming, such lots of fun!
When the fortnight had ended she begged
to be allowed to remain another week.
Her father and mother were obliged to
return home, but they granted Nellie's
wish and went back witnout her.
Nursie had received a letter which told
of the intended return, but no mention
had been made of the fact of Nellie's pro
longed visit.
Nursey ran quietly to tell Mina the glad
news of the family's home-coming, and
she seemed to understand perfectly well,
for she smoothed her feathers and ceased
her calling for Nellie.
At last the evening came. It was time
for the folks to arrive. Mina fluttered
wildly about when she heard the steps on
the porch.
After waiting patiently for Nellie to
appear she shrieked out: "Where's Nellie?
Nellie BicJt? I want Nelliel I do, Idol
Nellie!"
Of course this made every one feel very
lonesome for the little girl and they all
wished she were there.
A week later when Nellie entered the
yard she heard the voice of her pet ringing
gladly out the words, â¢ "Nellie's come.
Nellie's come. How do you do, Nellie?
How do you do?" and not one of the
family seemed happier to see. her back
again than the bird.
I think this was a very bright parrot,
don't you? R. Maud Malloey.

Wnere the stainless lilies of morning blow,

The truly gifted engineer always makes
one part of his work fit into another, and
no energy is ever wasted. A wealthy engi
neer who had set up a very fine place in
the country, where be had carried out
many pet constructive projects, was visited
there by an old friend.
The visitor had so much trouble pushing
open his front gate that he spoke about it
to the proprietor.
"You ought to fix that gate," said the
guest. "A man wuo nas everything 'just
so' should not have a gate that is hard to
open."
"Ha!" exclaimed the engineer, "you
don't understand my economy. That
gate communicates with the water-works
of the house, ana every person that comes
through it pumps up four gallons of
water."

Dear Editor: lam a little girl 12 years old.
My papa has been taking The Call for some
time, and we all enjoy reading it very much.
Four years ago last December we came here
from Oregon for my papa's health, and are now
living on a forty-acre colony. Lots of fruit
and flowers. We call our place "Flora Bale
Orchard."
We like California quite well, although it
geta very hot in summer.
I have two catsâ Trlx and Goldiaâ and one
doc â Fudge.
We have ripe apples, black and rasp berries,
peaches and apricots now.
I have always wished to be an authoress and
have already written quite a number of
stories, onÂ«; of which I send you, and if you
think it worth printing I should like to see it

Dear Editor: This week I have worked out
the puzzles again, and hope they are right.
I like the puzzles and stories very much, and
the letters, too, and would lUe to tee mine
printed if you have room.
My papa is dead, and I live with Mr. and
Mrs. Rleber, who take The Weekly Call. Mm.
Rieber cuts out all the little stories and pastes
them in a scrapbook to save them for Baby
Harold. He is only 16 months old now, but
walks anywhere, and we have such good times
together. I ride him all over the yard on my
back, ana when I stop to rest he clucks to me
to "get up," just as if I was a horse.
We have a aog named Jim Budd, and he trees
ever so many squirrels. We also have two
little calves, Bert and Bertha; both are
moolie*, and so nice and gentle.
There Is no school near here, so I study at
home. We live near a sawmill, and Harold
and I are the only children, but we do not get
lonesome.
The last of this month we are all going
camping up in trie mountains. Mr. Rleber's
brother and his family from Belmont are going
too. They have two children, ana lam sure
we will have a good time.
I hope this is not too long. Your friend,

worn; if we all possess them it is certain
that we seldom put tnem on, although
every day new musiins are arriving from
Paris to tempt us to their immediate adop
tion." The latest are covered with chine
rosebuds alternating with colored stripes.
From these are evolved delightful bodices,
but the skirts are failures nnless mounted
on glace silk; even then the gown will not
be a success unless literally incrusted with
lace and ribbons. One made here of pale
pink organdy sprayed with odd greenish
tiger lilies has down the iront nine lines of
creamy white Valenciennes insertion. The
high bodice has a vest of the same inser
tion, between each row of which is a three
quarter-inch ribbon of a delightful shade
of green. The sleeves are ruched, the
puffs at the top are very small, and over
them fall epaulettes of the lace and ribbon
edged with lace.
As a general rule American women have
rarely perfect taste, and with regard to
their ;:owns too much praise cannot be
lavished on them, and Vogue with much
satisfaction comments on the laudatory
remarks lavished upon the gown worn by
Mrs. Breckinridge at the coronation. The
cr.ation is thus described:
"Mme. Breckinridge, wife of the United
States Embas&ador to the court of St.
Petersburg, wore an adorable toilette. Its
inspiration was not caught from the tra
ditions which govern court gowns worn on
such occasions, but, for all that, it was not
wanting in royal attributes. This notable !
gown was built of rose-pink velvet em
broidered in beautiful Renaissance design
in silver. The corsage decollete carre
was embroidered with jewels, and the
sleeves 'ballons ouverts,' which permitted
the arms to be visible. Attached to the
shoulders by superb jeweled buckles were j
long draperies of rose velvet plisse, which !
hung with peculiar grace. A manteau de
cours was fastened across the shoulders
with 'elegance souveraine,' the writer adds, !
and describes it built of apple-green mir
ror velvet covered with silver embroidery.
Worn in the hair was a superb motif in
diamonds sparkling against a pouf of
white feathers, and clasped around the
throat there was a doubie collier of dia- i
nionds and pearls. A beautiful toilette in
deed, and worttiy of the reputation Ameri
can women have made for themselves
wherever they go for exquisite taste and
an innate fitness in always wearing their
clothes with grace and charm."
Compared to the way many New York
society girls dress, I consider our Califor
nia maidens are positively economical, but
of course there is a great deal of difference
between a New York and a San Francisco
season, for a belle must have a great num
ber of frocks, all dainty and pretty, even
if not costly, when nizht after night sbe
goes to numberless balls, cinners and
theater parties, to say nothing about cos
tumes for calling, for concerts, lectures,
teas, etc. One undisputed authority states
that for a season at Newport or any
fashionable summer resort a debutante
who wishes to be properly garbed on all
occasions must have between three and
four dozen dresses and appropriate hats,
gloves, parasols, slippers, ties and shoes in
plenty, to say nothing of the quantities of
exquisite fairy-like underwear of all de- j
Bcriptions. Many American buds have
outfits that even a royal bride would re
gard with admira
tion. The young
Duchess of Marl
borough is said to
have at last ascer
tained that her hair
is far more becom
ing when worn in
tiny, fluffy rings
on her forehead. As a result of this dis
covery and a large supply of marvelous
frocKs, she bids fair ere long to be consid
ered almost if not quite a bÂ«auty.
The touch of black in costumes contin
ues in great vogue, as it does assuredly
give a certain peculiar individual charm,
and the black Valenciennes lace, so warm
ly advocated last year, is in great favor at
the present moment One of the most
stunning toilets worn at a recent draw
ing-room by a matron had a train of dull
black satin trimmed with black tulle and
black poppies. The black moire Dodice
was adorned with poppies, the berthe and
sleeves were of black tulle studded with
diamonds. The black moire petticoat was
draped with a great scarf of tulle with two
bows of the same and poppies. The veil,
gloves and plumes all were black.
For those in half-mourning beige and
black is a welcome novelty and a great re
lief after the other trying combinations of
gray and black. Beige has another advan
tage, it is usually becoming to the com
plexion. Linens and beige batistes with
collars, cuffs, corselets, belts, 6ashes,
plastrons and bretelles of black taffeta are
stylish for wear until after luncheon.
Sensible traveling dresses escape the
ground all the way round, but there is no
reason that they should be so short as to
make an ugly display of the feet. White
or light embroideries and silk trimming
should be carefully avoided on such gowns ;
indeed it would be hard to improve on a
lightweight costume consisting of a akirt
and jacket and a separate waist. A silk
shirt waist commends itself warmly to
most of us. Uncrushable silk is employed
in the manufacture of the best.
Golf is now the fashionable outdoor sport
East, but here tennis is better understood
and tuuch liked, as the interest in the San
Rafael match proved. Extremely fetch
ing are many of the tennis dresses de
signed for pretty girls this season. The
skirts of all of them reach the tops of the
boots, and they must not be too full, for
excessive width means that they will flop
around in an absurd and ungraceful man
ner. Red pique, mohair and duck of the
brightest scarlet are much affected. The
jackets are short and the shirt waist al
ways of some soft fine fabric, usually or
gandie or mull. Wash materials are far
more used for such suits than serge or mo
hair.
Even the girls who rank as champion
players and pay no attention to style look
well in their light-weight linen skirts and
loose blouses of white India silk, provided
the skirt hangs properly and a suitable
belt unites skirt and biouse. Some play
ers like belts of ribbon. In such cases fig
ured ribbons are not worn, moire taffeta
being the most fashionable.
I strongly recommend it, as all the most
harmonious and artistic shades are to be
had in this new weave. Girls, be sure to
purchase sufficient to pass twice around
your waist, ab once is not sufficient. When
such ribbons become slightly created they
must be discarded, but if carefully pressed
will make, when quite a number have ac
cumulated, a pretty ruffle for a petticoat
which needs to be done over, and this re
minds me that alpaca continues to be the
favorite fabric for petticoats to be worn in
the country. They usually have one or
two ruffles of bright silk to relieve their
somber appearance.
For white and light dresses the white
underskirts of finest cambric or organdie
are more dainty than ever, revealing at
times rows upon rows of lace, embroidery,
or the most exquisite of drawn work.
Many of the most admired are the handi
work of the fair wearers, and of course
two silk petticoats at least must accom
pany heron her summer outing unless she
expects to spend the season "far from the
haunts of men."
The Rreat dressmakers of the worid Â»re
said all to be informing their lair clients
that the Grecian waist is to be the correct
style. The measurements of the Venus of
Milo, the Pallas and Diana are being care
fully studied, and so we are told that
better health among fashion's devotees
will be the result At the present day. in
this part of the world, absurd wasp-like
waists are seldom seen, and men long ago
ceased to admire waists wbich indicated
that all the floating ribs had to be crowded
into an unnatural position.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 12, 1896.
Correct Cycling Costume.
A blue and white check mohair is so
chic that I am sure you wiil all admire
it. Plaid batiste ribbon trims it and ex
tends down the back and front of the
bodice. It also shows beneath the folds
oi the tablier in the skirt. The creamy
point-lace collar is small, but it serves to
give a pretty finish. The sleeves are quite
new.
The Ascot gown illustrated is a model
which will be much appreciated, as it
abounds in pretty suggestions. It is
carried out, as portrayed, in a grass lawn.
The sKin nas bands of lawn embroidered
in fine tambour work of delicate pink,
blue and gold tinsel. The straps have an
edging of yellow lace, applied with a
niche-like effect. The blue lisse vest, ac
i cordion-pleated, is covered by a vest of
fine Brussels Wee. The bodice is of
tambour-embroidered lawn. The tabs are
fastened back with paste diamonds. Loops
of black velvet fall upon the shoulders.
Broad jeweled galons are now scan on
both skirts and bodices and compose many
deep empire belts.
Tulle has never been so rarely beautiful,
as the most costly gems now gleam
amongst its meshes. It forms most of the
swellest evening sleeves and extends down
the sides of many a debutante's frock as tÂ»
short panel, which ends in a great tftsael.

:;;t : -- Linen and Tie
For business or morning wear the three
buttoned sack coat is the most popular,
the waistcoat and trousers being of the
same fabric. A waistcoat of brown linen
is preferred by some men and is perfectly
correct. Such waistcoats have bone but
tons. With such suits are worn square
toed, laced, black leather or russet shoes,
and colored shirts, with white, standing,
all-arounu, turn-down collar. Pinhead
and birdseye patterns are used with much
satisfaction for such suits. A correspon
dent states that for the next three months
the latest cloth is of an indescribable
mixture, and a few yants away the mate
rial has the appearance of plain cloth.
The trousers are loose and straight at the
top and taper toward the foot.
The correct evening dress has the low
cut U-shaped waistcoat. The suit is of
smooth Vicuna cloth, although Sedan
cloth is increasing in favor. It is elastic
and well lilted in London. The coat has a
notch collar, silk facing to within an inch
of buttonholes. It is square cut in front,
the square-cut tails reach to just above
the knees. The shirt has two buttons
(either pearl or enamel can be used), the
collar is a straight stand-up one, the tie
white â of plain white cambric rather
stiffly starched, the ends are square.
Some prefer white pique, but when so em
ployed it must be absolutely plain.
The somewhat pointed pumps are of
patent leather and the hose of black silk.
The white gloves, stitched with white,
and the crush hat complete the costume.
The black cape overcoat shown is liked
by many better than the Inverness cape.
It is a comfortable garment and sensible.
However, the Inverness will never B o out
of fashion.
Several young men have lately been
wearing black satin waistcoats with their
Tuxedo coat.-. However, this is probably
only a passing fad.
A man may have to wear a shabby coat,
i but if you want to place him look at bis
linen and his tie; they speak more loudly
I than words, and it is a fact that many
â¢ give too little attention especially to the
i selection of ties. Concerning Ascots in
soft white pongee silk and pique, &s they
â  abound, it is well to note that they make
: a very pretty effect with a straight" stand
ing collar and a frock coat. Tney are tied
i with a slight bouffant puff and the stick
| pin â to-day pearls or plain gold being
most fashionable â is placed a little distance
below the meet of the aprons. Narrow
| four-in-hands of soft silk or pongee make
also a very smart tie, but I do not care for
them so much in bows. I have seen
much light brown or buff pongee neck
wear, wnich looks cool, neat and inviting.
Cotton and linen ties will be in all col
ors and designs and patterns imaginable.
in these days of bright-hued shirts and
waistcoats great care should be taken not
to make too vivid a contrast of color.
Walking rainbows or Kaleidoscopes are
ridiculous. Many men have their ties
made to match their shirts, and still others
wear dark blues, solid brown, pink or
buffs. Cotton ties in one color are belter
form than those in patterns.
The cotton tie is now worn en neglige,
with the most informal cf lounge suits,
land in the country. In midsummer one
can wear anything, and then bring out
your cotton tie. Any color, even white, is
allowable. C. C.
Paris Costumes Worn Since the Edict Against Balloon Sleeves Was Promulgated.
At last the "Grand
Prix" is a thing of the
past, and, as usual, it
was a notable event,
and nil the most
beautiful women in

attired gorgeously,

exquisite taste. The

of an artist's brush, and it is said that the ,
Strand looked like a well laid out flower
garden in full bloom. The unusual warmtb
caused most of the capes and collets to be j
laid aside. As a result the gowns were |
plainly seen. Almost all of them were
made with round waisU, some tight titting,
with revers and lace trimming; others
were regular blouses, well drawn in at the
waistline. The deep corselet waistband,
which 1 have mentioned several times,
was worn by many. The skirts were plain,
and bung faultlessly. They were of mo
hairs, silks and other firm fabrics. The
muslin skirts were trimmed, but all trim
mings were either inserted or let in plain.
The elegantes were dressed with striking
simplicity; linens and foulards predomi
nated. The latter were covered with large
scrolls, or Japanesque designs in wnite, i
the grounds being usually either dark blue
or black.
Even the Parisians show great reluc
tance to give up the large fuil sleeves,
they who are usually so ready to accept
every novelty. As a result, on this occa
sion many voluminous sleeves were com
mented on, but the tight ones witn the
Valvis puff at the top were much in evi
dence. The bolero has been revived, and
is usually of guipure over the bodice. It
has come back in a fuller and shorter
form. A correspondent writes: "There
served stand of the Jockey Club was full
of elegantes in very simple dresses, a few
of which I will describe. The young
Duchess de Noailles was in canary-colored
batiste over silk with corselet belt and
collar of yellow satin ; large Louis XV hat
with white ostrich feathers. Duchesse de
Morney in ecru batiste over pink, with
wide pink satin belt; black tulle bat orna
mented with pint roses and bird of para
dise aigrette. Comtesse Guy de la Roche
foucauld was in straw-colored muslin over
silk, a grcnat straw hat with shaded pink I
roses. Baronne Leonine appeared in
blue and white foulard, with corselet
belt of white satin; Leghorn hat with
; white ostrich feathers and yellow roses. A
Tlie Colonial Dames of Jlmeriea in California
All the Colonial Dames in California
were Invited to meet on Thursday last at
the home of Mrs. Samuel W. Holladay
for the purpose of incorporating.
The articles cf incorporation were read
and duly accepted, and some other busi- j
ness completed, after which the Dames
welcomed their latest member, Mrs.
George Whitney of Oakland. Colonial
tea and cake and other dainties were then
served, and many were the interesting bits
of news and the anecdotes exchanged
over the tea cups. Indeed, it was with re
gret that the ladies finally bid their gra
cious hostess adieu. Since the meeting,
which occurred during October, 1895, mucli
interest has been manifested in this or
ganization, and now over twenty members
are enrolled. When the Dames first met
together, Mrs. Selden 8. Wright, the chair
man, announced that tiie National Society
of the Colonial Dames of America had de
cideu to permit any twelve or more women
residing in a non-Colonial State, who were
member* in good standing of Colonial
(State societies, to meet together for social
and historic purposes under a chairman,
who fihonld bo appointed for the first year j
by the National president, and thereafter
to be elrcted by them, subject to the ap- :
proval of the National society, and that |
thesi> associations hbonlii be known as the '
Colonial Dames of America in the State of j
In accordance with these conditions
twelve ladies, each one a member of a
Colonial State society and in good stand- I
very pretty mauve frock with white lace
applique was worn by Comtesse de Fels,
with a white straw hat and white feathers.
Baronne Alphonse de Rothschild was in
black and white silk, with a capote of
Dlack velvet mixed with white tulle and
white feathers. Mme. Carroll was in white j
spotted muslin over pink silk, with belt of i
pink satin and white straw hat and
feathers mixed with marguerites. Com
tesse Le Marois looked well in ecru mus
lin, with a yellow shade of lace; straw hat
and white feathers with mauve flowers
intermixed. The young Comtesse de Cas
tellane was in pink, with a bolero of rich
old lace over the bodice; black straw hat,
with white lace and white feathers."
Many frocks had long sashes, and.
speaking of the boleros, reminds me that
they are not only of lace, as chine silk is
also used and lace inserted lawn is effec
tive. They reach within a quarter of a
yard of the waist and are square back and
front, but of course have no sleeves.
Those of lace are all made over cream
muslin and finished with a narrow lisse
pleating.
The latest collars are reported to be cut
in a novel form. They are lined with
muslin and are of heavy satin, cut on the
cross, and fasten at the back with a wind
mill bow, which is posed very high aeainst
the neck and composed of loop and ears.
Such bows require at least one yard and a
half of ribbon. Long, slender-throated
women will rejoice in this style.
The sashes are long, and as the ends fall
to the hem of the skirt black satin ribbon
is preferred. Many taffetas bodices for
slim figures are made with a Swiss corselet
boned at the bacK. front and sides and fin
ished with a narrow pleating of satin on
either side, where tne hooks and eyes are
sewed. This corselet is invariably com
posed of biack satin ribbon. Almost all
the foulards worn at the race were made
with a draped cincture, which continued
its folds into the sKirt, edged with bis
Valenciennes, the sleeves, in lace or lawn,
wrinkled to some distance above the eibow,
ending in a shoulder puff over a silk iin-
ing therewith, met at the residence of the
chairman, Mrs. Selden S. Wright, 910
Lombard street, on tte Bth of October,
18.<>5, and organized an association entitled
"The Colonial Dames of America in the
State of California.'
After due deliberation the following
rules were adopted :
That the twelve organizers of this associa
tion shall constitute a committee of approval
and shall decide upon the acceptability of all
persons proposed for membership to the dif
ferent Colonial State societies.
This privilege or duty snail belong alone to
the twelve organizers of this association.
Vacancies occurring in this committee shall be
filled by the committee itself from the body of
the association aud each person elected shall
be clothed with all the privileges ot a first
organizer.
The names of all per-ong to be presented ior I
membership to the different Colonial State j
societies must be presented to the body of
twelve organizers for its approval.
Every member of said body shall vote.
In case of unavoidable absence the absentee
shall send the name of the candidate written
on a slip of paper with yes or no inscribed
thereon. This slip of paper must be placed in
an envelope, which shall be sealed and marked
on tne outside with the name of the voter, and
also the word "vote." This envelope shall be
inclosed in another addressed to the chair
man of the committee ou approval, who shall
open the envelope marked vote for the first
time on the day of voting ana In the presence
of the committee. She shall then deposit the
slip of paper inclosed, without unfolding it,
with the other ballots. Two negatives Bhali
â¢erve for the rejection of a name. The de-
ing. With the ex
ception of this puff
ing the sleeves were
transpareut, plainly
revealing the arm.
It is necessary to
observe that such
wrinkled sleeves are
only made when the
material allows the
arm to be seen be
neath the folds.
One greatly admired Parisian gown is of
the finest clearest white muslin entirely
made over white taffeta. The skirt is
beautified with black lace insertions ar
ranged in the form of great Louis XVI
| knots. On each of the sleeve puffs one of
| them is artistically applied. A corselet
and ruff of yellow satin give it an air of
great chic. With it is worn a pale pink
hat wreathed with crushed shaded pink
roses; from the left side a large black
aierette arises. Black gloves complete
this costume.
Charming must be a dress of a light
linen. It is transparent, and gray in
color. Insertions are let in the skirt and
bodice of the same sbade, and the whole
; collar is over apple green silU. The collar
' and waistband are of black satin.
Equally fascinating is a model carried
out in gray dust linen. It has wide black
lace insertion laid on flat on the skirt in a
vandyked pattern.
I have just read a very good description
of yet another "Prix" gown, which is
doubtless beautiful, but I should say far
too elaborate for such an occasion.
It was of mauve taffetas covered with
flounces of Valenciennes lace up to the
waist. The lace was about five inches
wide and had a kind of open lace heading i
that made the lace fall well, and under
each row of lace was a pleating of mauve
net to Keep it from falling flat. The
bodice was covered with lace laid on flat,
and the sieeves were Valenciennes and
mauve net mixed at the top, and the lace
tight over the mauve from the elbow to
the wrist, a good deal of mauve net and
lace round the neck; the capote worn j
with this secured a wreath of shaded !
mauve poppies close together with aigrette \
| of mauve irises, and just a pink flower on
one side to enliven the sameness of the
mauve. It was a charming costume.
Strange as it may seem blue tulle hats
are being trimmed with mauve orchids.
Almost equally popular are green ana
> mauve, and on black and white hats are to
' be seen carlands of green and white roses
liberations of this committee shall be entirely
private.
In every instance where there are such mem
bers in our association, the name of each ap
plicant presented for the approval of the com
mittee must be proposed and seconded by
members, of the Colonial State Society which
the applicant desires to enter.
This organization is not, as some
imagine, a mutual ancestral admiration
society, for the value of the records and
relics rescued from oblivion by these ladies
cannot be overestimated, and the more
complete the knowledge of the history of
our country the greater will be the pride
and interest manifested in its progress,
and even now the beneficial results of such
societies are to be felt. Mrs. Selden S.
Wright, the tirst chairman appointed for
California, has not only many Virginian
ancestors, but almost as runny illustrious
ones from the North. Mrs. Wright is in all
respects a most remarkable woman, broad
and progressive in her ideas, and, although
a great-grandmother, accomplishes more
every day of her life than many an active
young woman. It is owing to her wise
guidance that the Colonial Society in this
State is flourishing so greatly, for she has
devoted much of her time and energy to |
maturing the rules which have Jed to j
these results. At the tirst meeting the I
chairman appointed as her secretary Mrs.
George A. Crux, as treasurer Mrs. Joseph
L. Moody, and as historian and corre
sponding secretary Mrs. Cyrus Elwood
Brown.
Mrs. George A. Crux was the first mem
ber to become a dame from California,
having been admitted to the Virginia so
ciety on the 22d of January, 1894, through
more than a dozen noted patriotic ances
tors who lived in Virginia and Maryland.
Mrs. Cyrus Elwood Brown (nee Bergen) is
of a well-known historical family which
has resided for many generations in Brook
lyn, N. Y. Her record is both a brilliant
and interesting one, and she comes in
from both New York and New Jersey.
Mrs. Joseph L, Moody has several Knick
erbocker forefathers, and is a member of
the New York society.
The organizers of the Society of Colonial
Dames in the State of California are: Mrs
Selden S. Wright. Mrs. George A. Crux!
Mrs. Joseph L. Moody, Mrs. Cyrus E.
Brown, Mrs. Samuel W. Holladay, Mrs
John D. Tallant, Mrs. A. B. Rose, Mrs
William C. Peyton, Mrs. A. A. B. Wright,
Mrs. C. H. Jouett, Mrs. Maddox, Mrs s'
Wright.
The board of directors consists of Mrs.
Selden 8. Wright, Mrs. Samuel W. Holla
day, Mrs. Henry Gibbons, Mrs. Joseph L. |
j Moody, Mrs. George A. Crux. Mrs. Cyrus
lE. Brown, Mrs. E. W. Newhill, Mrs.
Henry Darneal, Mrs. 8. Van Wyck.
The insignia, worn only on special oc
casions, is very handsome, being of blue
and buff, Washington's colors. On a
ground of turquoise blue enamel is a
raised figure of a colonial dame in gold.
The stars are alao of the enamel.
with what is now considered the most
stylish aigrette, the birds-tail osprey
Numerous floral toques are worn, which i
appear to be wonderfully simple affairs,
easily put together, but in reality only a
skillful woman can imitate the lovely
affairs, which are imported by the best
milliners. Violets and roses are most
frequently used in their composition, but
a dark-haired belle is very charming m
one of dark crimson fuchsias made over
leaf green tulle. And speaking of tulle re
minds me that tulle toques are also in
demand.
They are said to closely resemble the
turban-like affair which we can remember
as havinir been worn by Jtfme. de Stael
in her famous portrait. On these
triumphs sometimes roses, sometimes
"mignonette or forget-me-nots stand
upright while clusters are sunk into
the tulle with delicious effect and
becomingness." But to return to hats
I saw a useful and lovely chapeau here a
few days ago. It was ot a butter yellow
satin straw, had a low, broad crown and a
straight medium brim. The crown was
encircled with the most beautiful of vio
lets and their leaves. They were also made
to take the place of an aigrette with good
effect, and at the back resting on the hair
was yet another beautiful cluster. A sim
ple hat, but the work of a celebrated New
York milliner. Another was about the
same shape in a fine brown straw, on which
nodded some' very exquisite, dark, ricn
wall-flowers in the center, by which was
placed numerous short loops of a taffeta
ribbon green flecked with brownish lights.
Upon a very young girl I noted a shade
hat of white leghorn, caught up here and
there with rarely beautiful blush-roses. It
was completed with a great bow of ereen
taffeta, and strings of the same. How
charming for a sweet, bright summer girl.
Only the vulear are seen wearing hat? or
bonnets on which are crowded several dif
ferent varieties of flowers, crude and hid
eous often in effect, for now our hats "are
poems of hue and shape," the Mowers
which adorn ihem being of the finest text
ure and quality when they are not real, as
is the case on the hats of most of our lead
ers of fashion. A coarse paillasson worn
a few weeks ago at a race was turned up
at the back, revealing a lining of wliite
satin over which was fashioned a cache
peigne of reai gardenias, while the low,
queerly twisted crown was half covered by
a crescent of trie same fragrant bktsaoma
intermingled with pink heather. Flowers
will last for a long time if their stalks are
dipped into burning sealing-wax betore
being arranged in a hat, dress or sunshade.
Elder blossoms, thistles, willow pussies
and water clovers are in great demand. A
much-admired toque is covered by white
tulle. A bird of paradise aigrette rises
from that and highly effective are winns
of black and cream appliaue lace. Charm
ing also is a cream straw, with an erect*
panoche of cream tips which springs from
a bed of pink rose and roseleaf foliage,
while a cream bow of tulle filis the back;
and, really, I should describe at least one
bonnet of light brown straw trimmed with
a bow of pale green ribbon and pink roses,
with soma brown velvet and jet cabachons
on the brim.
Highly prized books are frequently
covered with rich velvet, embroidered in
gold. Sometimes in place of gold dark
silks of a contrasting shade are employed.
The insides of the book covers are, of
course, lined with silk. Marcella.

PUT ON NEGATIVES,
Wonderful Achievement of
a French Scientist in
Photography.
Images of the Mind Reproduced
on Sensitive Films by
Dr. Baraduc.
Successful Experiments at Paris
Which Confirm Those of Dr. Gates
at Washington, D. C
Last week's Eastern Sunday papers were
replete with lengthy descriptions and more
or less obscure illustrations concerning
the latest Parisian scientific discoveryâ
the reproduction of thought waves or
Vibrations on a sensitized plate in a dark
room.
The New York Press goes to the length
of saying that the French scientist, Pro
fessor H. Baraduc, has photographed a
Boul as it emanated from the subject's left
hand, and, to make the matter still more
ridiculous, publishes a dark plate indis
criminately disfigured with a series of
wavy gray lines.
In some of the more lucid and conserva
tive descriptions of Dr. Baraduc's achieve
ments it appears that he has really an
nounced to the French Academy his abil
ity to photograph thought emanations as
they project images in the astral lieht.
This is hardly the explanation that Dr.
Baraduc offers of his own discovery,
though it is difficult to say just what ex
planations he does offer or what claims he
actually makes, since the Eastern press
has gone into various kinds of rhapsodies
over the discovery and somewhat bidden
itÃ real significance under a mass of sensa
tionalism and froth.
It appears, however, that Dr. Baraduc
has made an official report of his achieve
ments in a paper entitled "La Photogra
phic de la Pensee' (The Photography of
Thought), m which he declares his ability
to secure impressions of thought waves
and images on the sensitized photographic
plate under proper conditions. His paper
jiives the result of over 300 experiments.
He uses what he styles a "magnetometre,"
which resembles nothing more closely
than a mariner's compass, for which he
claims:
Firstâ That when it Is held near the left
hand, or for that matter near any portion of
the left side of the body, the magnetic needle
iÂ« repnlsed a distance of 5 degrees.
Secondâ That when it is held near the right
side of the body or the right hand the needle
is attracted or drawn back through an arc of
20 degrees.
Furthermore, when a sensitized photogra
pher's plate or film was held between the left
hand and the needle and afterward dipped in
a developing bath it showed the appearauce of
a plate perforated by a full load of small bird
shot.
While no doubt of vast importance, per
haps in the realm of thought and philos
ophy more than practical science, Dr.
Baraduc's experiments are not entirely
new to even western scier.ee, and are fore
shadowed and thoroughly explained in
theory in many of the current Theosoph
ical books.
To explain briefly, Tbeosophists knowâ
and western scientists are grudgingly ad
mitting â that thought projects currents
and Images into an all-pervading ether
that, though not personal, is yet of a cer
tain density and can be seen by the
physical eye under certain conditions of
light and physical development. There
are scores of old books and manuscripts
from India and Egypt still extant which
explain many of these subtler things in
nature, and the discovery of the Roentgen
ray and these experiments of Dr. Baraduc
but con firm the knowledge the ancients pos
sessed. Dr. Baraduc's experiments are also
confirmatory of those of Colonel deftoc; as,
ol L'Ecole Polytechnique in Paris, and of
those of Dr. Elmer Gates at Washington,
D. C
The New York World*! assertion that
''the gist of these experiments is that vital
force, vitality, thought, or whatever you
may choose to call it, is a physical foree â
not spiritual or metaphysical at all," is of
course ridiculous, and could only be made
by one lacking the knowledge that there
are things, forces, plant-s or vibrations in
tlie universe which are neither physical
nor spiritual. Whatever thought itself
may or may not be, it is quite safe to ven
ture the assertion that Dr. Baraduc has
not and no scientist ever will succeed in
photographing it. What has been accom
plished is, as stated, merely the photo
graphing of the vibrations and images
that are constantly being created by the
power of thought. J. H. G.
X w Constituent of the Atmospher
It has been conclusively proved that the at
mosphere contains a new constituent hitherto
unknown amounting to nearly 1 per cent of its
volume. It has been called argon for the pres
ent. Hydrogen Deing taken as the unit of
value, the new substance has a density of 19.9.
It is Deculiar for the fact that it is more sol
uble in water than either nitrogen or oxygen,
and has spectra different from any other gas
or vapor. Every attempt made so far to cause
argon to combine with other bodies nas
been unsuccessful, the most active chemical
absorbents exerting no action UDon it. Argon
has been liquefied. Its critical temperature
was 121 degrees C, and its critical pressure
w aÂ« 50.6 atmospheres. Its boiling point under
atmospheric pressure is 186.9 degrees C, and
its density at this temperature is about 1.5,
greater considerably tha - i that of liquid oxy
gen. It has been solidified to a crystalline
mess looking like ice, which melted at 189.6
degrees C. Argon is not a compound, but a
â¢ingle element or mixture ol elements. The
rvidence indicating a mixture is the dual
character of its spectra; tne evidence
in favor of its single nature is that it has a
definite critical temperature and pressure, and
when liquefaction under pressure begins the
pressure remains constant until all the gas
is condensed to a liquid. When liquid
it has a constant boiling point and a definite
melting point when solid. It would appear
from the experiments of William Crookes and
Professor S. E. Tilman, U. 8. M. A., that the
ratio of the specific neats of the gas at a con
stant volume aud pressure indicates that the
gas has but one atom in its molecule. This
fact, taken In connection with its density, fixes
the atomic weight of arson at about 40, if It
be a single gas; if it be a mixture, the mean of
the atomic weights Is 40. Besting provi
eionally on the strongest evidence, and assum
ing argon to be a single element, its atomic
weight of 40 casts doubt upon the comple
tion oi the periodic classification of the ele
ments. Some very startling and interesting
problems are brought to the front by the new
discovery which are yet to be solved Dy ex
periment and diligent investigation.
The spectra of ar^on have been accurately
examined and determined by William Crookes.
Professor Olszewski carried out a series of
experiment to determine its behavior at low
temperature and high pressure. He success
fully liquefied it and solidified it. To Lord
Ray'leigh belongs the honor of having first
found that the accepted composition of the at
mosphere was not sufficient to explain certain
facts based upon that composition. The
energy, seal and skill displayed by him
through many long year* of monotonous work
have commanded universal admiration. Re
cently Professor Ramsay asked permission to
join in the efforts to solve the difficulty which
the latter's experiments had developed. To
the joint work of these two able men is due
the isolation of the new substance, and they
will probably divide the honors as the discov
erers of argon.
After a large series of careful observa
tions one of the principal electrical com
panies in the United States has decided to
put Crookes tubes on the market, and
tubes of approved sizes and types may
now be purchased. It is said, says the
Electrical Review, that very successful re
sults have been obtained with the tubes
already furnished. Experiments are be
ing continued, in order that the most im
proved forms may be within reach of the
public continually.
HUMAN BEINGS WHO
RARELY SEE DAYLIGHT.
They Live in Dark Caverns and
Raise Mushrooms
Curious Subterranean Excavations
Near Paris, Some Extending Under
the Streets of the City.
The cultivation of mushrooms (cham
pignons decoucbe) is realiy a matter of
"ancient history" iv France. The people
are so fond of them, and find them so nu
tritious as well as profitable, that very few
Frenchman are so poor as to be obliged to
do without their beloved vegetable.
Notwithstanding the antiquity of the
mushroom it is, even in these days of en
lightenment, a mystery. Nobody, save a
few savants, knows much about it, but
everybody in France knows tnat it can be
made to grow in almost any quantity de
sired.
The mushroom loves a place that is cool,
damp and dark, and it is for this reason
that the mushroom is almost invariably
cultivated in subterranean excavations
throughout France.
In the department of the Seine there are
over 3000 of these caves, and in them live
about 300 peopleâ "champignonists," who
rarely see the daylight. The descent into
these caves is by way of rope ladders.
One of the most interesting sights
around Paris is the subterranean excava
tions where this vegetable is raised; some
of the caves are nothing more nor less
than tunnels, while others are exhausted
stone quarries, quite a number of them ex
tending under the streets of the city.
These caves have to be specially prepared
for their growth, and great care and atten
tion is given to their keeping and perfect
preservation. The temperature varies but
little In summer, and only climatic influ
ences, that is, a very wet or very dry sea
son, more than one of heat or cold, tends
to affect the dally production of the beds.
.As nearly as possible a temperature of 42
degrees Fahrenheit is maintained. It is also
considered of great importance that the
air currents move invariably in the same
direction. This should be from north to
south and never more than slightly appre
ciable. The mushroom beds are prepared
by sprinkling a quantity of dried and pul
verized wild mushrooms over a" layer of
earth heavily enriched; then, in alternate
layers, the mushroom powder and earth
are put together until a height of about
three feet is attained. In about three
months from the time the bed is prepared
they begin to bear and when once started
continuously bring forth large quantities
each day, regulated more or less
according to the amosphere of the cares.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 12, 1896.
HOW THEY INFLATE
THE BIG BALLOONS.
Improvement Devised by a Local
Mechanic.
One Man Stands Inside the Sphere
With a Spon?e Over His Mouth.
A Dangerous Work.
There are thousands who have seen a
balloon in the process of inflation, but
there are not many who understand it.
Until recently it was the correct thin? to
erect, at a certain distance apart, two high
poles, connect these at the top by means
of a line run through a ring at the top of
the balloon, in order to hold it in position
while the inflation was going on, then,
when all was ready, these poles had to be
thrown down, attor the rope had been cut,
Within two months a local mechanic has
devised an arrangement which is a vast
improvement on the old method and does
away with one pole. He ha 9 set up a tall
pole, about seventy feet in height, and
from that there is a swinging arm about
ten feet long, which is dropped until it is
in a horizontal position. In the free end
is a pulley, on which runs a rope that is
connected with the ring at the top 01 the
balloon, and by it ttie sphere is raised to
the required height. The use of this, it
has been proved, saves time and mini
mizes the chances of danger, When it is
time to Jet go the rope that holds the bal
loon in place is freed, by one motion it is
palled out of the ring, the arm is quickly
raised to a horizontal position and the in
flated bag can rise with its attachments.
The inflation of ft balloon sixty feet in
height is by means of hot air and smoke
produced by the use of from fifteen to
twenty gallons of gasoline and kerosene,
according to the state of the weather, and
the time occupied in the inflation is from
twenty-five to forty-live minutes. That
also depends on the state of the weather,
for the colder the atmosphere outside the
balloon the greater the time required in
inflating and the more fuel required. Di
rectly below the suspended balloon is
driven into the ground an iron cylinder
having a diameter of about three feet, and
this is the Hue for the furnace beneath.
Running from the furnace there is dug In
the sand, or more solid earth, a narrow
channel abont three or four feet long, the
end farthest from the balloon ending in a
deep pit, in which stands the man who
feeds the furnace.
The balloon, having been hung from the
top, is stretched at the mouth to its capa
city of extension and the edge held down
by a circle of sacks of sand. This haviug
been done a circle of men and boys form
around the outside of the sphere and hold
it steady by means of straps sewed to it,
and it is also held by means of guy ropes
to prevent it from swaying and coming in
contact with the flames from the furnace.
These preparations having been made "a
watch" is placed inside the balloon, thai
is*a man who holds a wet sponge between
his teeth and covers his face with a hand
kerchief â the. Bponge enabling him to
breath without inhaling the smoke, and
the handserchlef protecting his eyes from
the burning sensation that smoke pro
duces.
His duty ia to watch the height to which
the flames raise above the top of the cylin
der, and to announce the fact to the man
in the pit who is the feeder. All be'ng in
readiness for feeding the man in the pit,
who is provided with a tin basin filled with
oil or gasoline, and has a small tin cup in
his hand, tnrows several cnpiful of the
liquid into the furnace and then runs "a
mine" to it, This is a long piece of news
paper saturated witn oil, and that is ig
nited. Then the feeding is done in a
measured way by throwing a cupful of
liquid through tbe channel to the fur
nace, and after that a few seconds the
voice of the watch is heard call
ing out "live feet," "twelve feet," "six
feet," or whatever the height of the flame
shooting up through the cylinder may be.
This serves as a guide to the feeder, who
either increases or diminishes the supply
of fuel.
To keep up a regular supply of heat is
the mystery of the trade, and it requires
considerable practice to maintain it. If
too much is fed to the surface there is
danger that the balloon will catch fire,
and if too little is fed there is danper that
the hot air already in the sphere will cool,
and a collapse will be the result. The
feeding and the calline out goes on
until the balloon is filled to its capacity,
and the order is given "All ready. 1 ' Then
it becomes the duty of the watch to place
a cover provided for the purpose over the
top of the cylinder to prevent any more
fire from ascending, and alter that is done
the order "Everybody let go" is given,
and the inflated bae rises, carrying with
it parachute and aeronaut, while along
side of the cylinder stands the watch, who
during his imprisonment has become as
black as a negro by the smoke that has
settled on his features and hands.

BALLS
The last communication from Professor
Elliott of the Field Museum expedition in
Africa, dated April 27, gives a humorous
account of the professor's men breaking
camels.
"You can imagine." it reads, "that
there's a circus around here while the in
struction is going on. When the untamed
camels arrived I heard a tremendous
growling in â  front of the door, and on '
going out I saw one of these amiable
beasts being led by his keeper, but
walking along with every expression
of disgust, both :in his countenance
and voice. The man stopped (ditto camel),
and attempted to tie the beast's forelegs to
gether, when it reared, and, striking out
,with its forefeet, : landed on the keeper's
stomach and head, sending him flying
through space as if shot out of a cannon.
The man. picked himself out of a ditch
with a hand on each bruised part, and the
camel, which had never ceased roaring, was
taken in charge .by two other and more
robust natives and led to â  the tents, or,
rather, induced to go by energetic assist
ance of a very sharp iron 1 rod
applied' in v a;: most vigorous and mis
cellaneous manner. Similar exhibitions
are being conducted daily, and 'we
are now ready to lend the ' recently
broken camels. Within three or four days
they are said to become tractable. 1 formed
' opinion of ,'a camel forty years , ago
when I rode across the Arabian deserts,
and I see no reason to alter it in any way.
The creature has so many talents -. and so
many ways of exhibiting them. And, to
begin with, it can kick harder, higher,
swifter and of toner than a Virginia mule,
and can use all four feet at one time in a
kicking match. Then it can bite worse
than a vicious horse and 'â  buck in a way.
to make a bronco blush with absolute
shame. No i cowboy aver lived who can
stay, on. that perch seven feet from
the - ground - during . ; a â¢ camel's s ex
hibition :of . : gymnastics. Then he
can run away whenever he feels like it,
and he is often : seized , with -a; desire to
slope. Upon an occasion of this kind bis
rider experiences a sensation between be
ing blown up with dynamite or struggling
against the throes of an earthquake until
all his joints are dislocated, and he drops,
a limp, inert mass, to the ground."

ANDREE SETS OUT
TO THE NORTH POLE,
Departure of the Famous
Swedish Aeronaut From
Stockholm.
Crowds of Tourists Go to Spitz
bergen to See the Balloon
Ascension.
The Great Journey to Begin From the
Isles of Norway â Grave
Dangers Expected.
Andree, the Swedish aeronaut, and his
two companions, Ekholra, and the young
Swedish physician, Steinburg, who will
accompany him on his exploration of the
polar regions in a balloon, left Stockholm
in June, and embarked at Gothenburg
on the steamer which will take them, with
all their apparatus, to Spitzbergen, the
starting point of their aerial voyage. At
Gothenburg the party was joined by Mr.
Lachambre, the inventor of the balloon,
The North Pole. It is his intention to
accompany them as fur as Spitzbereen, in
order to inflate the balloon and see them
off.
When the daring travelers left Stock
holm public enthusiasm was immense.
An enormous crowd surrounded the depot,
and greeted the departure of the train witn
frantic hurrahs.
Special tourist boats were run from Eng
land and Germany to Spitzbergen in or
der that sightseers might witness the de
parture of the balloon, and a Swedish
company has constructed a hotel on that
desolate land and has pledged itself to
keep up communication with the main
land during the entire summer.
The ascension will take place from the
isles of Norway, at the extreme north of
Spitzbergen, or, if they are found to be too
much encumbered with ice, from the
isle of Amsterdam, which is more to the
west. As soon as the apparatus and
materials can be landed a shed will be
constructed in order to afford shelter for
the inflation of the balloon. When
the balloon is ready to depart the
shed will be torn down. It is ex
pected that all this work will occupy
fifteen days. Then will begin the waiting
for a favorable wind. Thanks to the facil
ities which his guide-ropes ana his sails
will give him, Andree calculates that he
will not hare to wait for a direct south
wind; a southeast or southwest wind will
suit his purpose equally well. All the
steering nnd sailing apparatus can be han
dled from inside the basket.
It is believed that the most favorable
time to make the ascension will be be
tween the 20th and the 30th of July. An
dree has fixed his departure, if all goes fa
vorably, for the 24th. With a mean ve
locity of eighteen miles an hour he would
be at the north pole by the 26th. The ex
ploration could be terminated in a week
and the return to inhabited regions be ac
complished within the thirty days that
the floating properties of the balloon are
calculated to last.
But Andree is not puerile enough to sup
pose that the expedition will be so simple
as that. He is the first to admit that the re
turn voyage is hedged about wilh perils and
unforeseen accidents. "I might be back in
three months," he said to the reporter of
a Swedish newspaper who succeeded in
obtaining an interview the day before his
departure from Stockholm, "but also you
might receive no news of me for over a
year.
"Think of the distances to be traversed
if we should land in America or Siberia.
We should perhaps be forced to abandon
the balloon long before reaching civilized
countries. Our boat apparatus is trans
formable into a sledge, and we have pro
visions for five months. Even if we were
wrecked in the polar regions we should
not be worse off than other expeditions
have been that have succeeded in getting
back to civilization. We/ehall try to reach
Franz Josef Land, Greenland, or even
Spitzbergen. In the latter place we should
find the shed and provisions, but all ibe
countries I have mentioned are in com
munication with the outer world."
Andree in effect set off full of confi
dence. He is one of those calm, resolute
men with nerves of steel who shrink from
no danger and neglect no human precau
tion which can diminish risk and con
tribute toward success. No other proof
of this is necessary than the scien
tific manner in which he has prepared and
organized his expedition. It is thanks to
this that he has aroused the interest of the
highest authorities. It is thanks to this
that the idea of a balloon Arctic exploring
expedition, which is not new, has come
out of the domain of Utopia and pure fancy
and has entered that of reality.
Whatever may oe the final result of the
expedition he has opened a new horizon in
polar research by making people admit the
possibility of balloon explorations.
Among tbe many letters which Andree
recently received was one from a meteoro
logical society in the United States ad
dressed to "Mr. Frithof Nanaea, on board
the Fram, North Pole. By kind courtesy
of Mr. Androe."
Andree has taken it with him. May it
reach its destination. Heidenstan.

A SACRAMENTO MAN
WHO LOCATES PAY ORE.
George A. Thomas Has a New
Divining Rod.
At a Recent Test in Alameda the
Device Is Said to Have Worked
Perfectly.
If the claim of George A. Thomas of
Sacramento proves valid he has discovered
that for which the scientists and inventors
of the past century have searched as
eagerly as the savants of old for the
philosopher's stone. He says he has found
the magic material, or combination of
I materials, that through its attraction for
gold leads the happy possessor to the
most desired of all metals.
Mr. Thomas claims to be able to locate
not only gold, if in nny considerable
quantity, but silver, copper, lead, coal,
and even water, by means of his divining
rod. And Mr. Thomas is not the only one
who believes be has at last solved the
mysteries of the boweis of the earth, for
one Alameda man, a particular friend of
the inventor, is soon to be the proud
possessor of one of the rods, which is now
in course of construction.
Mr. Thomas is a miner, and for many
years past has journeyed to the moun
tains every spring to search for the rich
ledge which every miner hopes some day
to strike. When the prospecting season
is over he returns to his home and during
the winter months works on theinvention,
which is now all but complete and through
which he hopes to become wealthy.
Mr. Thomas does not desire to sell the
rod to those who are looking for gold â far
from it. In fact, he refuses to go into the
manufacture of them except for particular
friends, because he be'ieves that he can
reach the "pile" he has set his heart on
far more quickly by locating rich bodies
of ore and working them.
The nature of his discovery is a secret
for the present, but he does not hesitate to
show the rod to any one who cares to re
quest an exhibition. It resem hies nothing
so much as a plumber's tongs with elon
gated and elastic steel handles, which are
seen to be wound with fine copper wire.
Held between the jaws of the tongs is an
oblong cylinder, pointed at one end and
resembling a cartridge. This cylinder con
tains the discovery. A different one is re
quire 1 for each mineral that is being
searched for, the tongs being so arranged
t'.iat they can be opened and the cylinders
changed. J|r. Thomas s*ys that tnree
miles of wire thread are wound on the
baudles, and that the entire machine is
insulated. It is held above the head, one
handle in each hand, and is claimed
by those who have seen it work to at once
indicate the presence of the metal for
which it is prepared on approaching it.
At a recent private exhibition the rod
indicated accurately the presence of a
quantity of gold coin buried by one of the
skeptics in the party before the operator,
who was not the inventor and who knew
nothing of the location of the buried
money, had reached the scene.
Tbe inventor is said to be working a rich
mine in one of the northern counties at
the present time that he discovered
through this rod.
He did not strike ore when he first be
gan operations at th 9 point indicated by
the rod, but so great was his confidence in
his contrivance that he continued to sink
his shaft until ore was reached at sixty
feet. Subsequent developments have
proved tbe ledge to be very rich.
The Alamedan for whom the rod is be
ing built is also a miner and will start for
his favorite prospecting ground in North
ern California as soon as hia contrivance
is complete. â¢

ANIMALS THAI CURL
INTO LIVING BALLS,
Strange Phenomenon of
Many Members of the
Brute Creation.
Bears Roll Down Hill in a
Sphere and Frogs Hibernate
That Way.
The Porcupine and Others Assume
the Shape lor Offensive and
Defensive Purposes.
The curious little hedgehog of England
has a habit, shared by several animals, of
curling up into a ball when attacked and
presenting its spines to the enemy, the
head and vulnerable portions being per
fectly protected. Many animals assume
a ba'l-lika shape for various purposes.
Bears have been seen to coil up and roll
down hills. Squirrels and many others
roll up into perfect balls to sleep, ami
snakes have been Known to join forces
and form a living ball, in which shape
they passed the winter season. A natur
alist observed in the spring a hell of
snakes slowly rolling down a slight de
clivity, the heads protrudine in every
direction â a most uncanny and disagree
able spectacle.
Sometimes animals have been known to
assume a ball-like shape for protection.
Thus an investigator wishing to force an
ant family from its nest directed a larj;e
stream of water in that direction, at which
the *nts rushed as rapidly as possible to a
common center and clung to each other
with so much vigor that a ball as large as
a baseball was soon formed, which floated
down the little stream a living bark, which
undoubtedly saved many of the ants.
Several years aco a naturalist traveling
in Van Diemans Land saw one night, as
he was returning to the village, what he
supposed to be a wasp's nest, hanging to
the hieh branch of a tree. Wishing to
secure it. he marked the spot and sent a
man the following day for it, who returned
with the report that he had found the tree
but the nest had disappeared. The follow
ing evening the naturalist stopped at the
same place and found the nest as before.
Again the man was sent for it, and again
he reported there was no nest to be seen.
Out of patience, the naturalist went with
him the following morning, and to his
amazement the nest nad disappeared. He
related the experience to a friend and
native of the conntry, who expressed the
belief that the supposed wasp's nest was
nothing more or Jess than a ball of birds,
which proved to be the rorrect
solution. The two men went that
afternoon and concealed themselves In
the bush and as night approached
saw numbers of wood swallows (Artamus
sordidus) fiying about the limb, upon
which they soon began to alight; some
clinging to it like lizards, crawling about
in a curious way. Finally the birds began
to collect at a certain spot, and then to
cling to each other with heads down ; new
comers every moment increasing the size
of the ball until, to the astonishment of
the traveler, a living ball of birds was
formed, which clung to each other in this
way to sleep. A gun fired near the ball
caused it to separate at once, apparently
dropping into the air, to break up as the
birds released their holds and flaw away.
The wood swallow is a delicate little
creature about six inches in length, with
long powerful wings and a forked tail; its
color is a sooty gray, other parts being
blue, black and white. '
Among the animals of the sea living
balls are often found, especially among
star fishes, large balls of stars entwined
closely together having been observed, sev
j eral feet in diameter and weighing fifty or
sixty pounds. The oyster men have a
theory that the star fishes join in forming
balls to accelerate their march in upon the
oyster-beds. Thus they form in a ball, en
twining together, and it is supposed by the
men that the ground swell sends them in
until they reach the beds when they break
up, each star seizinean oyster. Be this as
it may, balls of scores of star fishes have
beeh found on the oyster banks, but
whether they form to be washed in upon
i the shells is another question.
The animals which are protected by
assuming a ball-like shape are many. The
hedgehog is said to have been seen rolling
itself up at the approach of a fox. So with
the porcupine when threatened by the
mountain lion, it rolls Itself up, showing
an array of spines that would daunt almost
any animal.
The armadillo, the curious little armored
creature from South America, is especially
adapted for this method of protection, its
covering being arranged in rings so that it
readily rolls up, presenting to the jaguar,
eagle or any animal that may attack it an
armored front impenetrable to all. It is
said that the jaguar will roll this living
ball about, finally pushing it iuto the
water, when it is obliged to swim or drown,
but it is doubtful if the story has ever been
corroborated. C. F. Holdes.

The Tivoli opera season has proved a
surprise. It is true that the theater has
given errand operas before, but they have
been sacrilegious affairs, for tDe most
part, calculated to mace Donizetti, Gounod
and the rest of them turn in their
graves. No one expected that the Tivoli |
would ever make amends to these com- j
posers, for all they bad suffered at its j
hands, but it is doing so, and the blessings
of the musical public are due to the man
agement for their change of heart. How
they are able to yive a conductor like i
Gustav Hiurichs, and singers such as !
Michaelena, Mme. Natali, De Vries I
and Abramoff, at the extremely popular
prices that always prevail at the Tivoli, is
a mystery that can only be explained on j
tbe grounds that the artists look upon j
their trip to Sao Francisco as a summer â 
outing and are willing to perform here for !
considerably less than they would demand i
in the East. The Tivoli already had an
orchestra containing excellent material,
and a chorus which could be augmented
into one of sufficient strength to answer
all reasonable requirements. Owing to
these combinations of circumstances, the j
theater is able to give a grand-opera season j
at prices probably unprecedented in any
other part of the world.
Why is it that local juvenile stage lovers,
when out visiting, hop, skip and jump
about their friends' apartments as if they
were bears dancing on hot bricks? They |
may say that it is to show the exuberance
of their joy at being asked to dinner or
luncheon with the adored one; or, perhaps j
they desire to convey to the audience the j
impression that they are gushing, artless i
young things not yet trammeled by the j
cold conventionalities of life. Any young
man in the cold, cruel world outside the
stage who bounded in and out of dining
rooms and drawing-rooms as Charles
Wyngate and William Beach did last
week would be sent back to
school to learn deportment and
in the meantime the hostess, fearing for
the safety of her bric-a-brac, would ask the
dear children to go out in tbe garden to
play till dinner was ready. There is a use
ful little book, called "Don't," which is
supposed to contain the whole code of
etiquette in a condensed form, but even
"Don't" has not provided for such con
tingencies as this. For Mr. Wyngate's
and Mr. Beacn's guidance a few new for
mulas might be added to the next edition:
"Don't run with a bound into the room
when you call on a lady to bring her
flowers; you might come down on some
one's corns." "When you visit a house
for the first time and espy your hostess in
the garden, don't rush forward madly to
introduce yourself ; she might think you
are running to tell her tbe house is on
fire."
To tell the troth, William Beach bad no
fixed idea of how to play the romantic
artist lover of "Americans Abroad." He
alternated between boyishness that would
have been callow for a youth of sweet six
teen and a timid attempt at intense love
making, which he had neither courage
nor ardor to carry to the bitter end. Allow
ance must be made for the trying nature
of the part. The poor artist is a dupe all
round â duped into thinking he has sold
his picture, duped into becoming engaged
to an heiress against his will, duped into
committing matrimony when he bad
sworn off, and one could not
help thinking, as the curtain went
down on the Stockwell players, that
he was duped wors.t of all in outlining
roseate dreams of the future with Miss
Olive Oliver for his bride. How this
handsome actress scolded 1 It made some
of the married men in the audience who ]
have stern-voiced spouses of their own
feel inclined to sing out to Beach, "Break
ers ahead; steer clear of the matrimonial
reef." Miss Oliver is a very clever actress
and a good-looking one withal, but she
should cultivate a contented mind, get rid
of her lean and hungry look, anrt study
the difference between indignation and
shrewishness. If Miss Oliver does not
modify her methods she will soon be hear
ing herself called tart and vinegarish.
Mrs. Vandenhoff played the part of
Mme. de la Baroness of "Americans
Abroad" with the intensity of a Mrs.
Vincent Crumraels. There were moments
when it was a positive surprise not to hear
her burst into expressions like: "S'death
villain, hence, or I slay thee." Herbert
Kelcey and Miss Effie Shannon were as
usual very good. We bid them farewell
with regret and hope that if Stockwell
comes to us next summer he will be able
to secure them again and keep them all
the season.
Most of the first act of "London Assur
ance" at the Columbia Theater might have
been performed in dumb show, for all the
benefit the audience derived from the
dialogue. For some reason best known to
himself, Harry Corsen Clarke chose to be
utterly and completely inaudible. Occa
sionally by dint of straining one's ears.it
was possible to catch a disjointed word,
but it would have been as easy to follow
the thread of his conversation, if he had
been talking Hindostauee, or Low
Dutch. His conduct was inexplica
ble, because in other characters he
has spoken with perfect distinctness.
Worthing always h*>.s an unfortunate
habit of swallowing his words, and in the
first act of "London Assurance" he posi
tively devoured them; Wyngate muttered
and Miss Lansing Rowan was inaudible
beyond the first few rows. After the ad
vent of Tyrone Power, who, by the way,
should be engaged to give elocution les
sons to some of the company, things grew
better; and from the time charming Lady
Gay Spanker made her appearance they
grew not only endurable, but very inter
esting. A word of praise must be given
to George Leslie. As Dolly Spanker, he
has found a character in which he can
shine.
California Theater.
Frederict Warde and Rose,Coghlan will
to-morrow begin to play lead with the
Stockwell Company at the California in
place of Herbert Keicey and Eflie Shan
non. Their opening play will be "Car
men," which has never yet been produced
here as a drama.
It was Olga Nethersole who first made a
hit with a dramatized version of "Car
men," her now famous kiss being the
sensation of the performance wherever
she produced her version of Prosper
Merimee's story. The version drama
tized for presentation at the California
Theater is from the pens of Marie Doran
and Mollie Ravel. Miss Coghlan will, of
course, play the title role, and Frederick
Warde will have good opportunities for
passion and pathos in the romantic role of
Don Jose.
The rest of the cast will include Olive
Oliver, William Beach John T. Sullivan,
J. N. Long, Harold Vizani, Hugh Ford,
George Smith, Richardson Cotton, Tiles
ton Bryce. Richard Royce, Anna Eggles
ton. Violet Aubrey and Anna Daly.
"Carmen" will be given lor one week
only. It will be followed by Rose Cogh
lan s new play, "Madame."
Columbia Theater.
It is stated by the management of the
Columbia Theater that so many requests
have been received for a repetition of "A
Charity Bail" that Belasco and De Mille's
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, jm/r 12, 1896.
play will be put on for the whole of this
week, beginning with to-morrow night.
Daniel Frawley being still absent in the
East, his role of Dick Van Buren will be
played by Charles Yvyngate. The rest of
the cast will remain tbe same as in "The
Charity Ball" production a few weeks ago
by the Frawley Company. Miss Maxine
Elliott, who appears as Ann Cruger, the
New York society girl, will be seen for the
last time before leaving for Australia, un
less it is decided to put on "The Two
Escutcheons" next week, in which case
she will play her role of the fascinating
American widow for two or three nights.
"The Social Trust" will be produced at
the Columbia during the last week in July
with Wilton Lackaye, Alice Evans, Alice
Pixley, Daniel Frawley and the new lead
ing lady whom Manager Frawley expects
to capture in New York.
Grand Opera-House.
Jules Walters, the "Gentleman Tramp,"
will appear for one more week at the
Grand in the line of character which he
has made his own. To-morrow right's
production will be a comedy-drama, en-
titled "Side Tracked," and in it Walters is
said to be particularly successful in vary
ing his tramp guise.
The play, as its title implies, has a rail
road flavor. It combines the elements of
realism and fun. In one of the scenes a
genuine locomotive and passenger train
cross the sUue, and Walters as "Ihe New
Tramp," en route for Congress, is side
tracked in a full-sized refrigerating car.
A number of new specialties, including
part songs and solos, will be introduced.
Tivoli Opera-House.
On account of its success, "Romeo and
Juliet" will be repeated this week on Tues
day, Thursday and Saturday evenings,
with last week's cast unchanged. On
Monday, Wednesday and Sunday even
ings "Rigoletto" will be played, with Sig
nor de Vries in the title role. This is one
of the operas in which Verdi has shown
especial kindness to the barytone, and,
judging from Vries' work in "Lucia,"
it is almost saje to say that he will give a
fine dramatic ana lyric interpretation to
tbe role.
The cast of "Rigoletto" is a strong one,
as it includes Fernando Michelena,
A.bramoff as Sparafucile, Richard Karl as
Monterone and Mme. Natali in her favor
ite role of Gilda.
Special care will be taken with the stag
ing and costuming of "Rigokstto." Gustav
Hinricbs will continue to conduct this
week. For the third week careful produc
tions are promised of Ambroise Thomas'
"Mignon" and Flotow's "Martha."
At the Orphcana.
The Orpheum's bill contains a number
of novel features this week â for instance,
j it will show us Jack Mason and Marion
Manola in their new departure of appear
ing on the variety stage. They have an
operatic sketch, written especially to dis
play Marion Manola's talents as an oper
atic singer, and Mason as a comedian.
The Donatos will appear in a grotesque
athletic act, which is said to excite sur
prise on account of their agility, as they
are all one-legged. Professor Slacart's
baboon, dog and monkey artists, who have
been appearing very successfully at the
Chutes Casino, will this week be added to
the Orpheum's bill. Lillian Western will
appear in a new musical act, and the
Rossow Midgets will play their last week's
engagement. Collins and Collins, the
Fredericks troupe and the Marimba play
ers are also on tbe bill.
Baldwin Theater.
The Empire Theater Company of New
York will inaugurate the coming season
at tbe Baldwin Theater on the 27th inst.
This year the organization comes with
Clyde Fitch's dramatization of "La Vie de
Boheme," which, in its English dress, is
called "Bohemia"; Pinero's new play
"The Benefit of the Doubt," and Arthur
Jones' "The Masqueraders" will also be
produced.
Macdonough Theater.
The best dramatic talent on the coast
will contribute to the programme which
is being arranged for the testimonial ten
dered to the retiring manager, Charles E.
Cook, by the patrons of tbe Macdonough
Theater. Tuesday evening, July 28, is the
date selected.
That Mr. Cook's efficient and successful
services for the past three years are appre
ciated by the Oakland public is evidenced
by tbe interest which is taken in the affair
by prominent business men as well as
theater-goers.
At the Casino.
The performances in tha Casino at the
chutes have proven popular, for every
afternoon aud evening the auditorium is
well filled. For tbe ensuing week Virginia
Araeon, the wonderful wire-wa!ker, will
continue her exhibitions; Addie Favart, a
child-singer and dancer from Australia,
will appear for the first time in the United
States, and Captain Beach, tbe "man
fish," will go into a glass tank, stay under
water for nearly two minutes, and smoke,
eat a banana and write a letter. The
Mario-Dunham family wiil continue to
make their remarkable aerial flights.
MAPtESON'S STARB.
Something; About the Operatic Troupe
That Will Appear in Sau Fran
clhco Next Winter.
The Imperial Opera Company is booked
to open at tne Academy of Music on Mon
day, October 26, with "Aida," and will re
main in New York for four weeKs. After
that it will go to Boston and make the
"grand tour."
The coionel declares that he has heard
from four hundred to five hundred singers
within the last six months, and having
survived the ordeal has picked out a few
who he believes will startle American mu
sic lovers in the right sort of way. He
has two "finds" whom he declares
to be only a little less lower than
the angels, vocally considered. These are
Signor Ruggero Randacie, a tenor,
who has been making a positively sensa
tional success for the past five years, he
says, in Bologna, Pisa ana Rome, bnt who
has never yet sung out of Italy. Then
there is Mme. Bonuaplata-Bau, a dramatic
soprano, the finest, says the veteran im
presario, ever heard in Ita'y. She has
been doing a very unusual thing â namely,
singing star engagements in Milan ana
Barcelona.
But these are only two young people.
Among the more experienced members of
his company is "the greatest tenor
living" (I quote the discoverer of Nils
son). His name is De Marchi, and he is
at present singing in Buenos Ay res.
Another great tenor who is to make
his bow for the first time before an
American audience is Durot, now at Bt.
Petersburg. He is a Frenchman and an
original actor. It is somewhat difficult to
conceive how he can originate anything
fresh in the majority of the tenor operatic
roles; but all things are possible to a
Frenchman, and especially to a Maple
sonian Frenchman.
Among the female voices Mme. Hercla
Darclee comes first on the list, with a
most romantic story, quite up to the
Maplesonian standard. She was (always
in quotation marks) discovered in Roii
mania, playing the violin, by Car
men Sylva, the poetess queen of that
mountain race. That she is a de
scendent of a noble family goes without sav
ing, and a realistic actress of great power,
resembling the great Duse in her methods.
The Queen-poetess had her properly tu
tored, and she has now the widest reper
toire of any soprano in Europe, says Colo
nel Mapieson.
But the priraa donna with whom the
colonel ''expects to catch the world" is
Mme. Josenne Huguet. This singer is
said to have a most remarkable range of
voice of undoubted power and facility.
On one nieht she will sing "Carmen" and
the next the Queen of Night in "The
Magic Flute." This may appear extra
ordinary, but it is vowed to be true.
Mme. Rene Vidal is a recruit from Paris.
She stands fully six feet hign, so it will De
well that all critics beware how they speak
of her. She is reputed to be the daughter
of a celebrated French general, and was
educated at Marseilles. She was found
and engaged by Gaillard to Â»injÂ» "Dalilah"
at the Paris Opera-House, and she made
such a success that her contract was ex
tended for three years.
The principal barytone of the company
is De Anna. This singer is the only mem
ber of the company who has been heard in
this country, and the memory he left be
hind was delightful â that of a man who
can sing with the middle register power of
a barytone, and yet can phrase with the
deligntful grace and t nder vocal quality
usually associated in the mind with the
voice of a tenor. Since his American tour
he has not sung out of Italy.
The conductors engaged by Colonel
Mapieson are Tuscanini, whom be con
siders one of the best general operatic
conductors in Italy. He jt was who
arranged the "Wagnerian repertoire for
Milan. The other conductor is Signor
Bimboni, who conducted during the
colonel's last season in London. The dip
lomatic military impresario says that a
better operatic orchestra can be found
right here in New York than in any other
city in the world. He will therefore en
gage his musicians in New York. Prob
ably tne colonel remembers his old set-to
with the local musical union.
Among the operas of the reportoire, be
sides the well-known scores, will be two
new ones by Leoncavallo, who will come
himself to conduct them. The composer
of "Pagnacci" has a great desire to visit
this country and is saia to speak the Eng
lish language perfectly.
The other novelty which Colonel Maple
son hopes to bring with him, if be can
overcome certain difficulties raised in
London, is "Andrea Chenier," by Gior
dani, which last season made a hit in
Paris. The principal part will be sung by
Hercla Darclee.
It seema ever so long ago since the
name of Maplesnn was one to con
jure with in the operatic world, and
after the septuagenarian impresario
had written his memoirs and the
critics had said they were "very inter
esting, but somewhat far-fetched," people
began to think that the white-haired mil
itary-looKing man who lived in London
apartments near Northumberland avenue
and had always some "boniie historic" to
relate had retired from the busy walks of
operatic life for good.
But they were mistaken. Though he
has lived beyond the term allotted by
the ancients and worried through
difficulties which his enemies sadly
said would surely kill him, yet
Colonel aittpleson * comes smilingly
to the front once more, with energies re
newed and refreshed after bis long rest,
and like Tim Finnigan at his own wake,
gets up and loudly inquires after the
fashion of that fine old Irish gentleman.
"Bad luck to ye all, did ye think I was
dead ?"â New York Heratd.
Dramatic Brevities.
Richard Mansfiela says he will add
"Hamlet" to his repertoire next season.
The Empire Stock Company will be the
next attraction at the Macdonough Thea
ter, Oakland.
May Nannary has secured the American
rights to Dam pier's dramatization of Rider
Hagcara's "Jess."
And still more McKinley music. Why
can't musicians agree in a McKinley left
motif and have done with it?
The Baldwin's bookings lor the coming
season include plays in which Beerbohm
Tree and John Hare will appear.
The Fawley Company may possibly go
to Honolulu at the close of their present
engagement to open the new opera-house.
Miss Margaret Craven will reappear
with the Fawley Company on the 20th
inst. in her former role of Vera in
"Moths."
On the 27th inst. the Stockwell Com
pany, with Frederick Warde and Rose
Coghlan, will appear in a revival of "The
Merchant of Venice."
The tour of the Mapieson Opera Com
pany will include but ten of the largest
cities in the United States outside of New
York. San Francisco is one of tne ten.
Francis Wilson's new opera, adapted by
Harry B. Smith, with music by Ludwig
Englander, has been named "Half a
KiÂ»u'." It will be produced in September
at Abbey's Theater, New York.
J. M. Barrie is at work on a dramatiza
tion of his famous novel, "The Little Min
ister." Charles Frohman has secured the
option on the American rights, and the
play will possibly be produced here next
season.
A favorite summer makeshift of singers
and concert artists, who would otherwise
be idle, is to form a combination of two,
four or six and make a tour of the popular
resorts, giving a concert or other enter
tainment at the leading hotels.

Wky
Ske Gried
There was a hush in the magnificent
residence of Mro. Glendella Martinson
nelle on Pacific avenue a few days ago.
The stillness spread around the neighbor
hood for blocks, the small boy walked by
with measured step, and his footfalls were
as soft as if he was treading on velvet;
the blue-coated guardian of the peace
looked sad as he gazed at the mansion,
and even the gripmen on the cable-cars
slowed up so as to make as little noise as
possible when their trains went by.
It was as a stillness of death, but there
was no crape on the door, yet there was a
mourner within the walls of the Martin
sonnelie mansion.
Reclining on a pile of pillows of the
richest materials that were on a divan in
the rear upper chamber, with a wide bow
window overlooking the bay and the fa
mous Golden Gate, was Mrs. Martinson
nelle, her eyes red with weeping, and stay
ing the evercoming flow of tears with a
lace handkerchief.
Suddenly there was a faint tingle of the
doorbell and a few moments afterward
Antoinette, the French maid, appeared
with a silver, gilt-edged salver having
upon it two cards. One read "Lillian
Partington Frontignac," and the other,
"William Jones, artistic decorator."
"Show them both up," was the com
mand, given in a tone that betokened a
deep sorrow within the frame of the
speaker.
"Together, madame?" asked the maid,
as if afraid she had not quite understood.
"Yes, Antoinette, together. I would
have them both here at the same time."
As the two were ushered in, Mrs. Mar
tinsonnelle made an effort to rise to re
ceive her friend, but it seemed too much
for her and she excused herself. She
asked Lillian to draw near, "for," said
she, "I want your comfort and advice in
this the hour of my distress." And then,
addressing the decorator, asked him to
draw a chair near so he might hear what
she had to say.
"Lillian, my dear, sympathetic friend, I
know you will feel for me when you know
all," said the reclining lady.
"To be sure, Glendella, you can rely on
my sympathy and assistance."
"i have sent for this ar,tist to place some
artistic designs on these windows for â "
"What! I ' exclaimed Lillian Partington
Frontignac, "and shut out this magnifi
cent marine view?"
"Yes," was the calm reply, "the sight
of water makes my heart ache Â«nd recalls
the cruel work of two days ago."
"What was it? Tell me ail about it, my
dear friend," said Lillian, excitedly.
And the decorator sat by, with eyes and
ears wide open, wondering what was to
come next.
'"My dear Lillian, you remember my
dear little darling, Charlie ?"
"You do not mean to tell me that he is
dead?" asked the listener in a voice full of
alarm.
There was a responsive nod and a move
ment to wipe away a fresh flow of tears.
"A month ago he was careless, and
while looking out of an upper window
lost his balance and fell to the ground
below, twenty-five feet at least, and when
I saw him fall I fainted. For an hour I
did not know anything, but when I came
to great was my joy to find him resting
in my lap. He had fallen on soiled
clothes in the basket that stood
under the window and he was uninjured.
How thankful I was. Bnt the next day I
was thrown into another fright on his ac
count, because be swallowed a fish bone
that stuck iv his throat and I thought my
darling would choke to death. They
worked at him for an hour and finally
with some instrnment the bone was re
moved and again he was saved.
"With what care I watched him after
that to see that no further harm should
befall Him, yet despite all my care the
fates were against me. Two days aco I
thought I would take him to Golden Gate
Park for an outing. I dressed him in a
new dress which I had bought for him the
day before. Ah! my poor Charlie," and
there was a fresh flow of tears that inter
rupted the narration until Mrs. Martin
sonnelle recovered.
"Yes, he looked as pretty as a picture,
and you ought to have seen him as he sat
on the seat of the phaeton by my side.
The people admired him and 1 felt proud,
you may rest assured. We were driven
around Stow Lake and at one point I had
the driver stop, so I could admire the lit
tle goslings that were swimming here and
there, for they were so canning. All of a
sudden Charlie jumped from his seat to
the ground and plunged into the waters of
the lake after the goslings. I cried out,
'Save him.' and the driver left his box to
go to his assistance. Then I saw two boys
in a boat row up to him and catch him by
the collar and drag him through the
water to the bank of the lake. The sight
made me sick at heart, and when I had
him brought and placed on the carriage
seat, I saw that he was dead â drowned in
his attempt to crtch the coalings.'"
The artist took a handkerchief from his
inside pocket and wiped away a tear.
"And do you wonder that I want the
eight of the water shut out?"
"That was very sad. but at times there is
no avoiding what the fates have destined
so we must bear up under the cruel blows
that are dealt us."
Mrs. Martinsonnelle then gave her order
to the artist, who after receiving and ac
cepting a suggestion from the visitor re
tired.
"But." said Lillian Partington Frontig
nac, "you did not finish."
"No, that is so. i sent the body to an
establishment on Market street and it is
to be stuffed. The man there said that he
never saw a more beautiful specimen of
the Japanese pug. Poor Charlie !"
Discouraged.

coming man will be like?

know. I don't believe he's coming. I
have given up looking for him. â Harper's

"He was a wreck! His hat was full of
holes, his trousers were frayed at the bot
toms, his face was bloated, bis eyes blood
shot. I tell you his condition was touch

"That's right â he touched me for $2."

were the rule at the Stock Exchange to-day and a
confident tone characterized the , dealings from
start to finish. The strength of the market was at
tributed to the repudiation of the Chicago plat

ment of the withdrawal of prominent menu er.s of

In add!. ion to the revolt of the sound-money

quite a sharp rally in the Western shares, which

ONE MAN'S VIEW
OF THE CHARTER.
J. M. Reynolds Thinks It
Assails Popular Gov
ernment.
POWERS OF THE MAYOR.
An Argument Against the In
troduction of a Monar
chical System.
PRECEDENTS ARE DEMANDED.
Results in Glasgow and Elsewhere
Cited in Favor of Divided
Municipal Functions.
It may be admitted that many un-
Thougntful people are actuated by the be
lief that the proposed new charter for the
City and County of San Francisco will oe
a benefit to the City, but it is only a belief
and is not based upon investigations or
facts.
Public men and public measures now in
bad repute have been advocated just as
persistently and energetically as some are
now advising the adoption of the new
charter. It is incumbent upon us to be
very careful and thorough in our examina
tion of this organic law which is intended J
to shape the future policy of this City.
The upright, honest and public-spirited
course of both the advocates and oppo
nents of the new charter is to favor and
facilitate a comprehensive review of the
principles involved in it, its provisions in
various matters of importance and the
publication, of both sides of tbe contro
versy as to its probable effect.
Tbe most important feature of the new
charter (waiving for the present technical
defects) is that it gives to the Mayor the
appointment of the City Attorney, Puolic
Administrator, the commissioners of ail
departments (excepting only officers of
revenue, Judges, Sheriff and Coroner), and
that it gives him the power to veto the
acts of the Supervisors. It would require
nine votes, if the new charter should be
adopted, to pass a law over the Mayor's
veto.
. I ask my fellow-citizens to stop and con
eioer thoughtfully what that means. In
quire where in municipal history this syt
tem has been successful. Let us not forget
that the veto power of a Mayor is the
semblance of monarchy, and is a system
which was stamped upon our institutions
by men who were accustomed to be
ruled by monarchs. Let us keep in
mind that the growth of political liberty,
of freedom of speech and of democracy
has always been gained by curtailing one
man power. No true lover of popular
government can at this late day success
fully defend a retrogressive movement,
like tbe new charter, which plainly is
framed on the idea that we can trust one
man with power more than many. No
well-sustained, authentic examples can be
civen which show that such a system of i
City or National government has re- j
milted in honesty, prosperity or happiness
for any extended period to any peopie or
city. It is ciearly contrary to the growth
of popular institutions and contrary to
American principles.
Not only is the appointive and veto
power (given by the new charter to the
Mayor) undemocratic and wrong in prin
ciple, but in practice it can be shown to be
unnecessary and unwise. By an investi
gation of the subject of municipal govern
ment it will be found that where the cities j
are governed by laree representative bod- i
ies (common councils and supervisors), f
without Mayors who have veto power and
appointing power more than any other
Councilman, there Is found more effi
ciency, honesty and a more harmonious
system.
It is quite remarkable thet in this coun
try we have followed an aristocratic plan
of city governments, while everywhere j
else in the civilized world the tendency is
toward a purer democracy. It is evident,
too, that the plan of the new charter
(which is used with some unimportant
moditications in other corrupt A merican i
cities) does not beget honesty or efficiency, j
We should give a basis for our opinions
regarding the benefits of the plan of the
new charter, and I call upon its advocates :
to show where similar laws have resulted !
in any great good.
The mere assertion that it will be a
benefit is like the espousing of untried
men whom we find too late are unreliable.
On the other hand Professor Albert |
Shaw's works demonstrate by careful I
study that efficiency, honesty and har
mony have been and are secured by repre- j
sentattve bodies of councilmen in whom
is centralized the legislative and adminis
trative functions. Many instances of this
assertion are given by him. He does not
start out with that idea and then make !
his investigations to sustain the idea, but .
has made a careiui study of the effect of j
different methods, and that conclusion is i
reached from the facts learned. Whereas
the advocates of tbe new charter will take
the opposite course, namely: they will
conclude that one-man power is best and
then hunt around for proofs that they are I
correct, but will find none, and their pre- ;
mise must fall.
Many examples of the desirability of
a large representative board of Aldermen
or Supervisors in whom should be cen
tered the legislative and administrative
functions of city government can be given,
| but for the present one will suffice.
Glasgow, Scotland, is world-wide re
nowned for its excellent system of city
government. It has seventy-eight council
men, chosen by the people, one-third
every year. This body frames the or
dinances, divides itself into administra
tive committees and performs all the
duties which by the new charter are given
to the Mayor, the Supervisors, the Com- I
misfiioners and other officials. There is
no clashing between the executive and
the legislative branches. Every proposi
tion it settled by the vote of the majority
of the council. No one man has power to
overturn the will of the representatives of
the people. The excellent results in
Glasgow and in many other cities .that
can be named show the value of, this form
of city government. It is tbe common
sense plan and the one adopted by all
private corporations; a city is only a great
corporation.
The failure of San Francisco's present
form of government is admitted, but its
defects are not eliminated by the new
charter. The present form is founded
upon the principle of divided functions
and divided responsibilities. We have the
Supervisors elected, a Mayor in an equivo
cal position, commissioners appointed by
Governor and county officers more or less
independent of the Supervisors. The
question is, Do we want (when we make a
change which is expected to endure) to
Rdopt a retrogressive measure? No. We
ought to improve our iaws by extending
instead of diminishing the principle of
popular government. The growth of the
best city governments that the world has
known has been in the opposite direction
to the principles of the new charter, and,
as such institutions have proven to be a

success, it would be decidedly foolish to
adopt an organic law establishing a one
man power.
It is easy to point, out tbe earmarks of
greed, the earmarks of hasty and loose
construction, the earmarks of ignorance
and lack of investigation and the ear
marks of narrowness and bigotry that are
found in the new charter. But at present
I have only dealt with the monarchical
and aristocratic tendencies which tbe
plutocracy of our country are endeavoring
to engraft upon our laws.

POINTS OF THE CHARTER
The ; . Municipal Reform League ' Issues
an Exhaustive . Ad- .
. dress. .
The 4 Municipal Reform League at its
meeting last evening decided to ; issue the
following address on the proposed charter:
To the Citizens of San Francisco: An import
ant duty confronts you in the coining election.
You will be called upon to decide whether or |
not this City shall have for its organic law the
new charter proposed by the Hoard lof Free
holders elected November 0, 1894.~%wpgHBMMt
That charter is a long one. It contains more
than three times as - many words as the consti
tution of California and nine times â¢as many
words as the constitution of the United States.
It would be an assumption of extraordinary
wisdom and foresightâ not likely to be Justi
fied by the result â to suppose any body of men
: could, in less than one month, prepare such a
; long document, involving the Important prin
ciples of ' the government of a great city, with
out there being some serious and fatal defects.
Tnis charter, so much longer than the other,
documents referred to. was framed within
thirty days, and we submit â  that the fatal and
serious defects which would expected to
appear under such circumstances are coming
to Hunt. Therefore, fellow-citizens, we urge
each and every one of you to read and study
this charter for yourselves. y For your assist
ance in doing so we offer I the following objec
i tions to it, asking I you at the same time to re
| member that if this : charter Is adopted in
November next it is almost impossible to
amend it, since it requires a three-fifths vote
of . the â¢ citizens - voting and the approval iof
both houses of the State Legislature before an
i amendment can be secured. - (A majority of
I the people may not hereafter be trusted in the
â¢ making of amendments.) -.*
. The Mayor a municipal dictatorâ pro
posed" new charter : makes ' the Mayor a muni
cipal dictator, for he will control nearly every
department of â¢ the City government; will be
president of the ? Board â of Supervisors ; - have
the power of vetoing all their acts; appoint
the i City Attorney, Public : Administrator,
Board of â  Public Works,. Park Commissioners,
Library Trustees,. Police, Park, Fire, 1 Election
and Civil .Service Commissioners and Board of
lldalth. The s proposed ' new charter declares
that as soon as the laws of the State will admit,
the Mayor - shall appoint ; the County Clerk,
Recorder, Tax Collector, Coroner, Justices 101
the Peace, Police Judges and Board of Educa
tion. â â¢ , ' ; ...,-- - v .
.- This is centralization with a vengeance, and
j will not gain , favor with those ) men who want
I a government of the people, by the people and
i lor the people, instead of - government by one
man, for that one man and his friends.
In the cities of Europe . the people are con
stantly securing Increased i Influence in the
management of their affairs. . The principle of
| large governing bodies, elected by and respon
, sible to the people, is receiving more and more
I support â  in â  the great cities â¢â  of - the \ civilized
world. London has > a governing body of 140
I members, Manchester 104, Glasgow 78, Parts
I 80, Lyons 56, Vienna 138, and Budapest 400.
These are true representative bodies and are
acknowledged successes. They give good gov
ernment and give 1 1' cheaply. .-- (See .' Professor
Albert Shaw's works, "Municipal Government
In Great Britain,'.', and "Municipal Government
on the Continent of Europe," Indorsed by Pro
fessor David Starr Jordan and all economists
of note.) â¢ :-â  -^SMP aH BBBMBHP4BMB
."Why is it . that in republican America the
capitalistic innovators | are seeking to central
ize government as far as possible in the hands
of one man? And is it possible that the work
ing and great middle classes, whose interests
are inseparably associated + with popular, gov
ernment, can be so misled as to vote to undo
all that has been gained for them in more than
100 ! years . of successful i contest against greed
of power? We j think not. They not, ex
cept t they are deceived and blinded by those
who profess to be interested in their welfare.
Second objectionâ The; charter is fatally de
fective.'",'. Ââ  ' ".,.â /...:â â â â .â ':.â .â¢.'â â â  :-...*- ?.
;- It does not provide any means by which the
Mayor, who is ,to rule all ; departments of the
City government, is to' get his office, nor for the
election by the people of any office except the
Supervisors; but does say (art. 14, sec. iit>) that
'every office" not made elective by this char
ter, "shall become vacant immediately on the
taking effect of this charter. If the charter is
adopted lv November next and is approved by
the Legislature of California (according to the
provision quoted) we will have no bead of
government, no Auditor, no Assessor, no Tax
Collector, no Treasurer, no Recorder, and the
legality of the acts of every one of these
officials, if they seek to act, will be called in
question by interested parties. Rien corpora
tions will seek to evade their taxes and refuse
I compliance to the City ordinances because of
i this equivocal and doubtful position of the
[ Mayor and other officers.
Third objection â Unconstitutional provisions.
The Stale constitution requires all charters
to be consistent with ii and the general laws of
I the State. The general laws of the State rt
j quire the Supervisors to tix the tax levy and
the Supreme Court has decided that it is not
consistent with the laws ot the Slate for the
Mayor to interfere with this duty. And they
will decide that the clause restricting the
power of the .Supervisors to levy taxes is in
consistent with the iaw of the State and there
fore unconstitutional.
It violates the natural and the constitutional
right of a large class of citizens to earn a liv
ing by the exercise of a profession they may
elect and for which they are qualified. ' Arti
cle VII. chapter 3. section 4 of this volumin
ous document provides that no person shall be
a "teacher in the primary or grammar classes
of this City or county except" he has "been
educated iv the public school system of the
State of Cali fornia."
A person who has been educated by the best
of jtrivate tutors, in the best private schools of
the State, or in the public or private schools of
any other State or nation, is barred from the
right to earn a living (in a calling the duties
of which he by education and training may be
able to perform in a pre-eminently superior
manner) because he was not educated in the
public schools of this State, and for no other
reason. A man may have been born in the
Stale, be educated in the State, be public
spirited, be talented, a skillful instructor and
an honorable citizen, but according to the new
charter he shall not teach. Is this just? Does
not this clause alone brand with infamy this
charter, and every one who, knowing the
existence ot this clause, shall vote for Us adop
tion? We maintain that provision is not only
infamous, but that it is contrary to the consti
tution of the United States.
Fourth objectionâ lt is an impediment to
municipal ownership of public utilities.
Instead of facilitating, as has been claimed,
the new charter prohibits the Supervisors
from undertaking public improvements or
from the construction of public water, light
and other desirable public work, if the propo
sition is not approved by the Board of .public
Works (paragraph 64, page 22). The Super
visors cannot undertake any public work un
less the approval of the Board of Public Works
is unanimous (article VI, chapter 1, section 3.)
It further prohibits the Supervisors from un
dertaking the acquisition of water works or
other needed enterprises if four members of
the Board of Supervisors are opposed to it
(article XIV, section 16). It further requires
them in all such matters to t*ke into account
the existing plants in case the same are desir
able and can be acquired upon terms Â»s rea
sonable as new works coula be procured by
construction (see page 22, paragraph 64). Per
haps this may explain why the directors, bond
and stock holders of the corporations owning
these monopolies are in favor of the adoption
of the proposed new charter.
Fifth objectionâ It favors contract work in
stead of day work.
The new charter requires all city work
amounting to more than $500 to be done by
contract. Experience of other cities demon
strates that this is more expensive than diiect
control by the city. It is an unjust system,
since it results in a reduction of wages to the
mechanics and laborers. It is unwise because
it leads to cojruption of officials by boodlers.
It is not the proper way to do municipal work,
because it leads to poor work and the bribing
of overseers by the contractors.
Sixthâ The one desirable feature of the new
charter can be obtained without the adoption
ot its objectionable features. All the advan
tageous and beneficial features of the. new
charter, excepting the civil service rules, are
already in onr laws. Unscrupulous persons
nnve publicly made arguments in favor of the
new charter on the ground that it contained
certain provisions which are already in the
law. Do not be misled by such misrepresenta
tions.
When studying the new charter compare it
with the existing statutes and ordinances ; you
will find that all its good features, with one
exceptionâ civil serviceâ are now on the stat
ute-books. Its bad features are doubtless due
to the fact that the Freeholders waited for n
I Supreme Court decision ro long that they had
but a few days to complete a work which
should be done with great care and delibera
tion, end also to the proDabilify that the mo
nopolies had their agents advising its impor
tant features. For many years the corpora
tions have been mindful of the advantage to
be gained by these measures, and the new char
, ter bears impress in many places of their de
signing work.
Therefore read it carefully (if you can find a .
i copy), and do not vote for it unless you are sat
isfied it will be harmless in its offset.
Remember â You do not want a long charter.
You do not want complicated, unintelligible
and unnecessary details in a new charter.
You do not want a charter that centralizes
power in the hands of one man.
You do not want a charter which restricts
the people in their political power so that
progress is practicably impossible.
You do not want a charter that must go to
the Supreme Court for interpretation in its
I most essential features nor one that prohibits
i a man from the exercise of his profession be
! cause he was not educated in certain schools.
But you want a short, clear and just charter
. which places the power of government in a
reprpsenuitive body of men responsible to the
| people, who shall manage the people's busi
i nes.s for the benefit of the people.
