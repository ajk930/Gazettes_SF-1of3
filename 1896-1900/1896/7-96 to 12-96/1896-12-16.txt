(CONGRESS SHOULD OVERRULE
> THE PRESIDENT.
This Government Must Extend a
Hand to Those in the Grip of
Robbers and Cutthroats-
' WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 15.â Morgan
. of Alabama occupied more than an
â¢_;,. hour in the Senate to-aay in presenting
â  arguments to show why the United States
;â  .should at once intervene to put an end to
tl^e war in CuDa. The speech attracted
â¢ very little attention either on the floor or
â¢in t ha galieri*?.
. The resolution offered yesterday by
. Slorgan requesting the President to
â â¢â¢.furnish copies of papers relating to the
condition of affairs in Cuba as to the Com
petitor case, was taken up and Morgan
: adiicessed the Senate on the subject.
The people and fie property of the
. -island were, he declared, the prey of com
; missioned guerrillas Â«bo had become
..robbers, cutthroats, assassins, ravishers
alid pirates, and an end had to be put to
th : atsaturnalia of blood and fire.
â¢ â¢â¢ In. commenting upon the President's
message, Morgan said that it -was a
.. marked feature in it that the President
assumed that the issue between Cuba and
Spam was either independence or exter
tnination. The President iad warned
Spain that the time Jor decisive action
was near at hand and that if he should
..how say that the time had arrived the
American people would sustain him.
American citizens of Cuba had rights un
der the Jaw of nations which the courts of
â :'; the United States and of all neutral conn
tries would protect and enforce -even in
'* I ' despite of opposition' from the President,
,-Â°.';f lie" should oppose them. The Unitsd
y Slates Government, would be in the most
â¢y* humiliating state of "innocuous desue
; 7 tuae" if it extended no Helping hand to
â¢ ..; the sufferers in Cuba and if it refused to
forbid further devastation and death
"which a cruel government was now inflict
" ing. ...
After quoting some paragraphs from the
-.* President's message Morgan asserted that
| 'â¢ Congress had never been presented with a
.stronger or more moving statement of
."'â¢facts than had been thus solemnly laid
: bo-fore the political and war-making de
. partments of the Government.
â¢ " â¢ â¢ Speaking of the President's Annual mes
. 'â¢â¢â¢ sage on the subject of Cuba, Morgan said
'.â¢""â¢"â¢it was or the most impressive importance
/'â  as a statement of the leading facts, and
that he had not beard that Spain contro
verted any of the President's state
â¢ " ments. He condemned 'the cruel and
:" 'inhuman butchery" practiced by the
,-. Spaniards, and said that if the United
""â¢ States wanted to stop a war of annihil
ation and extermination it was time to do
â¢ " :. . .'p. Congress, he said, should not hesitate
."*â '" to declare (for .the reasons stated in the
. * President's message) that the indepen
dence be recognized.
Morgan went on to discuss the condi
tion of Americans sentenced to death in
! . Cuba on account of their connection with
} the Competitor, and spoke of the United
'i States standing by and witnessing that
\- tragedy because interierence would be
I perilous and injurious to certain, business
: interests. â¢
If the United States were to intervene at
â¢ all he would prefer open war. And he
â * would vote for a resolution to that effect,
his justification being the law of nations
as ne understood it and the feeling he
A- entertained for those who lifted up their
â 1 'appealing hands and called for help
. against appalling cruelty and misrule.
No State in Spanish America has been
â¢ forced to endure such oppression, in peace
" and war, as the President's message had
justly charged to Spanish rule in Cuba.
â¢â¢' The United States had no alternative but
' the choice between the continuous repeti
â¢'* tion of terrible evils practiced by the
" -Spanish or a base humiliation .and cruel
* delay while rapine and destruction were
. rampant. He hoped that some .fortunate
â¢ ' turn in events might relieve the United
* > States from a duty it owed to Christian
civilization.
* *At the conclusion of Mr. Morgan's
speech, which was read from manuscript,
the resolution was agreed to.

To the American Publicâ Fellow-citizen's:
We are iniormed through the columns of the

]â¢ ailing in her efforts to suppress the people of
Cuba in their struggle for liberty by the ordi

and bribery to accomplish by trick and stealth
what her impotent army and incompetent

CLEVELANDâ " Don't stop my duck-shooting. Leave those things for McKinley-"
CHARLESTON, S. C, Dec. 15.â A special to the News and Courier from Georgetown, S. C, says: President Cleveland and party pitched camp at Fords
Point, which is at the southern extremity of South Island, yesterday morning, and have been shooting ducks in the preserves of General Alexander to-day.
Telephonic reports received this evening from South Island station, which is five miles distant from the preserves, are to the effect that the party killed some
sixty-five fine mallards, twenty-eight of which were brought down by the President's own shots. To-morrow the party will be given the pleasure of a deer-drive,
which has been arranged for them by General Miller and Captain W. Miles Hazzard. The scope of the country owned by these gentlemen abounds in wild deer and is
conceded to be the finest hunting grounds in the State.
CuDans? What we should do at once is to
petition Congress to act.
Every citizen should forward his earnest
protest against such outrages as have been
committed there by Spain, as well as to show
Congress that the peo;Je of this country are
ready to uphold them in any action they may
take.
The American fr.cnds of Cuba appeal to
you in this matter and urge every citizen to
do his duty and join with us in our petition to
Congress that these outrages may cease at
once. Franz Mayer, President.

TO FIGHT FOR CUBA.

BOSTON, Mass., Dec. 15.â Eighty-five j
men, strong fellows, intelligent and well !
up in military drilling, have left Boston |
bound for Cuba, where they will fight in
the army of the insurgents. They were
in command of Louis Marshall of East
Boston, who has seen service 7 ; in actual
warfare. He was a corporal in Union
army during the Rebellion. Since the
outbreak or the. war in Cuba his sympa
thies have been with the insurgents and
he has in many ways, assisted them ma
terially. ' ' _â¢' '_:;/â ':
The men volunteered their services to
the cause over a month ago and since that
time they have been drilling persistently
each day and anxiously awaiting the time
for their departure. They received no
promises in the way of , a return for their
services from the Cuban Junta in this city,
but they persisted in their requests to be
enlisted as. volunteers and said they were
willing to die if necessary for the cause of
Cuba. They then paid their own expenses
and when they boarded the cars last even
ing each man carried in hl3 pocket the
latest revised military manual of military
tactics and enough :_ money to purchase
supplies for many days.
They will buy their own rifles and side
arms, if necessary, before they sail. Their
commander. Marshall, will be given a
captain's commission in the insurgent
army when they arrive at : Cuba. When
they arrive in New York the men will be
marched to one of the suburbs, where they
will be drilled with other recruits for a
few days, after which they will all embark
for the seat of war. ,., â¢ ; -::f '

THIS MAY LEAD TO WAR WITH SPAIN.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 15 âWoodman (R.) of Illinois introduced in the House to-day a joint resolution "direct
ing the President to act in Cuban affairs," as follows:
"Whereas, The people of the United States have learned with profound sorrow of the murder of Genera 1 Maceo,
second in command of the armies of tne Republic of Cuba, and the murder of the members of his staff by a detachment
of Spanish troops, while General Maceo and his staff were keeping an appointment for conference under a flag of truce;
and
"Whereas, The war of extermination carried on by the Spanish Government against the Cuban republic, with its
murders, its assassinations, its outrages of women, its treachery, its cruelty, being entirely opposed to the rules of civilized
warfare and a disgrace to civilization; and
"Whereas, The proximity of the island of Cuba to the united States, and the interests and lives of American citizens
being in jeopardy, and the almost universal feeling in the minds of the people of the United States that such manner of
warfare should cease; and
"Whereas, The President having failed to carry out the wishes of the people of the United States as expressed oy their
Senators ana Representatives in Congress, but on the contrary, having in his annual message submitted to Congress on
the seventh day of December, 1896. given no adequate idea of intention to carry out the will of the people, but making an
argument in favor of Spanish butchers on the island of Cuba and in support of the alleged honor of the Spanish nation;
and
"Whereas, The situation having reached a stage where the honor of the United States is at stake, where the continu
ance of such crimes and brutalities within such close proximity to our shores cannot be borne, and especially as the history
of Spanish military operations gives no precedent on which to base a hope of change to compliance with the rules of civil
ization and of civilized warfare: therefore, be It
"Resolved. By the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, that
the Prtsidenl be and ha is hereby directed to express to the Government of Spain, through its authorized officials, severe
condemnation of the methods of warfare pursued by its forces in Cuba, and especially of the means resorted to in the
murder of General Antonio Maceo.
'â Resolved, That the Piesident is hereby directed to recognize the Republic of Cuba as an independent State and to
accord said Republic of Cuba all the rights and privileges in the ports and in the territory of the United States that are
enjoyed by the most favored nation.

SPREAD OF THE REBELLION.
Bands of Insurgents Infest the Outskirts
of the City of Manila.
MADRID, Spain, Dec. 15.â A dispatch
to the Imparcial from Manila, the capital
of the Philippine Islands, says that the
rebellion in those islands is spreading and
bands of insurgents infest the outskirts of
the city of Manila. Advices from the
Carolina and Canary islands say that ris
ings are imminent there.
The Cabinet council which was held
yesterday decided to purchase the English
transport steamer Prince of Wales in
order to expedite the transportation of
troops to Manila, and it was also decided
to purchase a complete equipment of
rifles for the troops.
Additional advices from Manila say that
the natives of the island of Mindanao
have revolted and the insurgents have
been joined by numbers of deserters from
the native troops. The insurgents, who
are numerous around Manila, are becom
ing very bold, often approaching near
enough to the town to fire into it.
The situation is admitted to be very
grave at Manila and is equally bad at
Cavite, wnere 150 prisoners revolted,
killed six soldiers, seized a quantity of
arms and tried to incite the native inhab
itants to attack the garrison. The revolt
ers were frustrated, however, and the gar

During the night there was a general mas

WYATT EARP EXPOSES THE
EXAMINER'S FAKE METHODS
Swears He Never Gave Any of Long Green's Young
Men the Statements Printed as
From Him.
General Barnes Will Move to
Dismiss the Injunction
on the Coin.
IT WAS AN UNLAWFUL FIGHT.
Proceedings in the Sharkey-Fitz>im
mons Case â Co'onel Kowa sky
Refers to Earp's Howitzjr.
Wyatt Earp yesterday exposed some of
the fake methods employed by that sensa
tional and utterly unreliable journal, the
"Long Green" Examiner, when he went
on the witness-stand and declared under
oath that he had never written anything
about the fight for that or any other news
paper, and that he had never given a re
porter an interview.
It will be remembered that the Examiner
published what purported to be a half
eolumn statement from Earp about the
fight over Earp's signature.
William Greer Harrison and others were
called to prove that the prize-tight between
Sharkey and Fitzsimmons was not a prize
fight but a gentlemanly glove contest ''for
points," some of the "points" involving
broken ribs, smashed noses, blackened
eyes and the knocking of one of the gen
tlemanly contestants into a state of coma
guaranteed to last at least ten seconds.
General Barnes announced tnat on
Thuisday morning he would move for a
dismissal of the complaint and the injunc
tion on the ground that the contest was a
fight for a prize and not a kindergarten
game.
One of the main bluffs made by Mr. Bad
Man Earp during his examination was
that Chief Clerk dough of the Baldwin
Hotel would not testify that be, Earp, had
called at the hotel the day after the battle
and had asked to see Fitzsimmons. Earp
was particularly strong in his denial of
this point, just as he was in other points
where be stands alone as against the
sworn testimony of many witnesses.
But, in this Ciough matter, the chief
clerk of the Baldwin gives Earp the lie in
a way most unequivocal.
"Earp has been coming here almost
daily lor his mail." Mr. Ciough stated last
night to an assemblage of attorneys and
newspaper men.
"The morning after the fight he came
>n, got some letters and telegrams and
asked me if Fitzsimmons was around.
The latter was in the cafe, and I suggested
that he send him his card. Earp did not
wish to do this, Dut came around a second
time askins if Mr. Fitzsimmons had yet
come out. It was evident Earp wanted to
see Fitzjiramons, but did not care to meet
him in the cafe. Finall}' he walked away."
This statement made by Mr. Ciough, a
man of unquestioned integrity, and a
hotel man oi most iavorabie renown lor
the past twenty years, stands now against
the denial of Wyatt Earp, the gun-fighter
and border ruffian, the Bodyguard of
"Long Green" Andy Lawrence.
Mr. Ciough is to make bis sworn state
ment to the Commissioner in regard to
this matter, and, at the outcome of the
whole matter, Wyatt Earp will be brought
up with a round turn by the Grand Jury
on an indictment for perjury.
The prosecution is particularly anxious
te see the Suarkey faction place "Dr." B.
B. Lte on the stand. This alleged physi
cian is credited with having b.'en either
paid or promised $1000 for bis services to
Sharkey.
Yesterday afternoon Attorney Kowal
sky and Martin Julian were closeted with
Captain Lees of the detective force, to
whom they disclosed some of the evidence
they had against Dr. Lee. In return they
asked for th" police's record cf Lee in the
matter of Matheny, the associate of a
burglar killed in Oakland a couple of
years ago while robbing a saloon. "Dr."
Lee came to the front, in that case and
tried to prove an alibi for Matheny, who
he claimed was with him in Sausalito on
the night of the Oakland tragedy.
In another case "Dr." Lee again at
tempted to assist a criminal with an alibi,
and again he was exposed.
Long Green's latest exploit in attempt
ing to browbeat the Tufts- Lyons baseball
team of Los Angeles has aroused great
indignation in Southern California. A
dispatch published elsewhere in this pa
per exposes the contemptible sraallness of
soul and the petty meanness of the lead
ing spirit of the Examiner.
Manager Lynch resnmed the stand yes
terday morning and was asked by Mr.
Kowalsky whether he had any special
privileges accorded him by the club. He
replied that he had not received any, ex
cept such privileges as were usually ac
corded to the managers of pugilists. He
explained further that when he took
charge of the door of the Pavilion he did
so at the request of Mr. Groom of the ath
letic club and acted as doorkeeper until
Sharkey arrived. This line of examina
tion was aÂ» to Lynch's supposed connec
tion with the National Atbletic Ciub.
On the preceding day Lynch swore that
the bet he had made on Sharkey was the
smallest he had ever made on a prize
fight. Yes'.erday, in iesponse to a similar
question, I c said that it was a smaller bet
than any he had made before on Sharkey.
He admitted in answer to a direct ques
tion that he had a pool ticket for $1400 at
odds of $1000 to $400. his wager being $400
on Sharkey, but that was nearly a week
before the fipht. His money was placed
with Henry Harris.
The witness was asked as to the certifi
cate-of deposit, and he. replied that it was
made payable to James Chesley, who in
dorsed it payable to Wyatt Earp. The
certificate was handed to Earp in the ring
by Police Captain Wittman. Lynch was
positive that Earp did not indorse the
certificate in the ring, and that it was in
dorsed at the Anglo-Californian Bank.
An important fact was drawn from the
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
witness at this point, and that was that
Earp did not deliver the certificate of de
posit to him or Sharkey on the night of
the fight, but took it home with him, so
that he had it In his possession when
Lynch called on Earp at his residence the
next morning.
Mr. Kowahky then inquired as to
Lynch's reputation as a hor3em an and
asked whethar any of his entries had been
refused at the Bay District racetrack
within the last few years, but an objection
was raised by Mr. Barnes, who remarked
at the same time: "If we have got to try
horse-racing as well as prize-fighting we
will never get through with this case.
We will next get down to cock-fighting."
"At which you are an expsrt," re
marked Mr. Kowalsky.
"Yes, was the retort, "I nave watched
you many a time."
The objection was sustained and Mr.
Lynch was allowed to escape from the
stand.
Thomas Sharkey, whose cauliflower ear
had been reduced to its normal propor
tions, was called by Mr. Barnes and, after
giving his age at 23 years, denied every
statement made by JMiiitn and Allen as to
his arrangement with Earp to have the
decision mude in bis favor. He denied
that he had put up $2500 for himself and
$2500 for Fitzsimmons to inoure their ap
pearance in the ring, or that he had made
any statements to that effect, or that ho
knew of any fraud in connection with the
fight whatever. He had gone through a
severe course of training for five weeks,
running twelve miles every morning by
I way of a bracer, and punching the bag
and his trainer.
Sharkey described the disabling blow he
received as follows:
"He gave me a left-hand jab in tho
mouth. Then he feinted with his left and
j sent his right hand across my head. I
! jumped back and he sent his left hand
i and hit me in the groin. As I was falling
! he hit me in the jaw. I was not insensible
! at any time."
It appears that none of the Sbarkey
j crowd were acquainted with Dr. Lee.
Sharkey swore ihathe didn't know him
and that he had no idea who had sent fur
him. Dr. Lee dressed the wound in the
I groin and then Dr. Kagan arrived on the
scene. In conclusion, Sharkey said that
he had had no voice whatever in the se
! lection of the referee.
B. Benjamin, sportiug editor of the
Chronicle, was called by Mr. Kowalsky.
He swore that on Tuesday, December 1,
he asked Lynch as to when a meeting
would be held with regard to the selection
of a referee. Lynch replied that they
would meet or. tiip next day, the day of
the fight, but he (Lynch) did not think
there was any prospect of their agreeing.
Lynch said also thst he had bet $400 on
Sharicey against $1000, with a bookmaker
I named Harris, a few days before.
The witness was in the press stand and
was busy writing from the dictation of Al
King. He i-aw Sharkey fall down, but did
not see the blow that felled him, because
Fitzsimmons' back was toward the press
stand and obstructed the view.
Sharkey was then recalled for cross-ex
amination by Mr. Kowalsky and was asked
as to whether any of liis money was in the
$10,000 purse or whether he had any money
bet on the result. On being asked whether
Dr. Lee in making his examination had
i struck him as hard as Fitzsiramons had
hit him, Sharkey replied that such was
I not the fact, whereupon Mr. Kowalsky
asked why then had Sharkey yelled with
pain under Dr. Lee's examination when
he did not yell at the time he was struck
by Fitzpimmons.
This question raised a buzz throughout

manner replied that he did groan "a bit
When lying on the floor of the ring.
Air. Kowalsky inquired whether Sharkpy
did not know that Dr. Lee was the witness
who proved an alibi ior burglar Lou
Matheny, charged with murdering a po
liceman in OaKlani. Sharkey replied that
he did not know Dr. Lee, but that Math
eny once visited his training headquarters
with Danny Xeedham and he was then
introduced to Matheny.
The witness swore that he never saw
Earp before lie saw him in the ring on the
night of the ficht. He was better ac
quainted with Dr. Lee, because Dr. Lee
and Dr. Ragan were still treating nim for
his injuries.
With reference to Lynch's report of his
interv ew with Hiram Cook the witness
said that Lynch said that Cook was an
honest man and would De a good referee.
Everybody who had been running with
Fitzsimmons and betting on him had been
advising Sharkey to take Cook as referee,
and besides. Cook had gone over to Sausa
lito to visit Fitzsimmons.
"Then," inquired Mr. Kowalsky, "when
you heard that Wyatt Earp had visited
Fitzsimmons at bis headquarters you
didn't object to Mr. Earp as referee?"
"No, sir."
"And you had never heard of Earp be
fore?"
"No, sir."
The witness denied also, in answer to
questions, that he had sent his bosom
triend Madden to Fitzsinxmons with a
proposition to give Fitzsimmous $500 if he
would agree to Madden as a referee. HÂ«
denied also that he knew that Madden
wanted to act as one of Fitzsimmon's
seconds. As to hisyelling witti pain under
the examination made by the physicians
on the afternoon of the day sneceeding the
fight hharkey said : "I didn't holler loud.
I'm too game to holler loud,"
'O, you are, are you?" sneered Kow
alsky. "Then why "did you holler loud
when Dr. Lee examined you?"
Sharkey explained that at that time he
was very sore. After denying that Dr.
| Lse had used a hypodermic syringe or
j had made any incision with a knife, the
witness admitted that Dr. Lee had used
iodine on Friday, the second day after the
fight.
Trainer Smith's statement that Sharkey
had got up cut of bed and smoked a cigar
was positively denied by Sharkey.

prom and as he was sinking to his knees
Sharkey exclaimed, "I've been fouled,
out he was not sure whether Earp heard
him.
The witness explained that he made
Lvnch's acquaintance in Salt Lake. At
that time Suarkuy was to box a man
named Williams am! Needham was to box
another. Needham had Lynch as ins
manager and Sharkey requesied Lynch to
loot after his interests as well. Lynch
was to teceive no compensation for his
services, but he had the privilege of see
ing Sbarkey exercise while training, ana
that was a very valuable privilege to a
betting man.
Judge Sanderson remarked at this stage
of the proceedings that he had expected
that the counsel woulu have inquired into
the character ol the affair, as to whether
it was a prize-fight or merely a friendly
boxing inalch. But the court did not
think that is was his affair, as he was sit
ting as an officer empowered to adminis
ter oaths and to take the depositions
of witnesses. He did not know what a
knockout was, whether it was the receipt
of injuries sufficient to disable a man from
continuing the fl^ht, or whether it was a
particular kind 01 a blow. Judge Sander
son remarked that he was probably the
only man in the State who had never ?een
a prize-fight; at least he thought so since
he had heard the evidence.
Sharkey explained that a knockout was
â when a man, after receiving a blow, was
unable to proceed for five or ten minutes,
and his definition produced a gasp of
astonishment lrom all who heard him.
He thought that a blow on the jaw was
the surest way to knock out a man.
William Greer Harrisoii was examined
as an experi on what constituted the dif
ference between a pr ze-tight and a glove
contest. lie said that a prize-liglit-was a
brutal exhibition governed by oniy one or
two rules, while a ulove contest was nov
erneJ by a complete set of rules. Strength
was the cbief element of prize-n^utiii-;,
while s-kill wa-s the chief element in iÂ»love
tighting. Custom had prescribed the use
of five-ounce gloves.
Mr. Barnes asked him whether there
were not fights to a finish under the Mar
quib of Queensberry rules, and Mr. Harri
son replied that such a thing happened.
A knockout w;iy not a serious affair. Oor
bett had knocked out the witness three
times in a half-hour, "but there is noth
ing in a Knockout. The man goes to sleep
all over," replied Mr. Harrison.
"Every man to his tiste," remarked Mr.
Barnes. -
Mr. Harrison insisted that there was
nothing in a glove-fight analagous to a
prize-fight. The exercise of ereat strength
was allowed in prize-fights, but wrestling
was debarred in glove contests. The error
of judgment on the part of a referee would
be in failing to see a foul, but he could not
very likely see a foul if none existed. The
decision of the referee was final, and there
was no appeal even when he made a mis
take.
The witness was a spectator of the
Sharkey-Fitzsirpmons fight and was posi
tive that no foul was committed by Fitz-
Simmons.
He considered that bouts between ama
teurs were more spirited and interesting
than those between professionals. It was
not uncommon, in cases where the contest
was very close, that half the spectators ob
jected to the ruling of the referee. The
cry of tne audience at the Sharkey-Fiiz
simmons fight was against the decision of
the referee. He heard or read the next
morning that General Barnes had said
that Fitzsimmons had fouled Sharkey.
Lera Fulda, ex-president of the Cali
fornia Athletic Club, was culled by Mr.
Kowalsky and explained that prize-fights
were dangerous to the contestants and
very often "resulted in the death of one
or more of the contestants."
The witness was not present at the fight
before the court, although he was in this
City at the time and was not sick. He
had made up his mind not to go, and he
did not go. In most o! the contests be
fore his club he had a provision inserted
in the articles to the effect that the de
cision of the referee should be satisfactory
to the board of directors in the case of
amateurs.
Judge Sanderson asked whether fighters
in glove contests did not blacken one
another's eyes, break ribs, smash noses
and knock one another senseless.
Mr. Fuid.i replied that such accidents
often happune.i.
"And you call that a glove contest?''
asked Judge Sanderson sarcastically.
The crowd tittered at this outcome of
the attempt to show that glove contests
were harmless sports.
Walter Watson, boxing instructor at the
Olympic Ciub, testified that he was dic
tating the points of the light to a short
hand reporter lor The Calj.. He saw the
finishing blows given and awore that Mr.
Fitzsimmons did not strike Sharkey afoul
blow.
Wyatt Earp was called and walked up to
the stand out of the jury-box with a tent
pole protruding just below the back but
tons of his coat. He said that h< was
chosen as re.eree by Messrs. Gibos and
Groom at 1 o'clock on thf afternoon of the
ii.ht. No one had spoken to him about
the matter previous to that hour. He was
but very slightly acquainted with Lynch,
and had not spoken to Lynch more than
five words at any one time.
"That man over there," continued Earp,
"Julian, I believe they call him, protested
against the bandages on Sharkey's hands.
I knew my business, and 1 knew that I
had a right to allow Sharkey to wear the
bandages. Then, when Julian protested
again, I went over to Sharkey and told
him to take off them bandages.''
"Did you tell Sharkey to take off the
bandages â that it was all right, anyhow?''
was asked.
"No, sir," replied Earp, "I don't deal
with them kind of people in that way; I
deal with them in a different kind of way.
I said, 'You take them bandages off.' I
done it in a way that Sharkey understood
what I said. I don't plead with them
kind of people."
The witness then described the finishing
blows. He saw Fitzsimmons strike Shar
key in tne groin and Sharkey double up
and groan with pain. Then he decided
that Sharkey had won on a foul.
He met Fitzsimmons four or five years
ago on Geary street in this City, in a sa

"You are not an excitable man; you are
a cool, calm man?" inquired Mr. Kow
alsky.
"I think so," modestly replied the wit
ness.
Then Mr. Kowalsky proceeded to inquire
as to Earp's business. He replied that he
had been a resident of California for thirty
two years off and on, and came to this
State in 1864 from Elliott, lowa. He had
lived in Idaho, Missouri, Colorado, San
Diego and Los Angeies until live years
ago, when he came to this City.
"Did you ever live in Arizona?" was
asked.
The witness replied that he lived in
Tombstone. Ariz., for a while, where he
was a Deputy United States Marshal, a
Deputy Sheriff and "Wells-Fargo's private
man." He also owned an interest in a
store and saloon there. His present busi
ness was horseracing, but the horses were
not his property. They belonged to a
woman in one of the interior counties,
witu whom he shared half his winnings
after paying all expenses. Earp told that
he had refereed a prize-fight in San Diego
and fiiteen or twenty bare-knuctcle rights
across the Mexican border in Lower Cali
fornia. "They were all prize-lights to
me," he added.
"Was this contest the other night a
prize-fight to you?' 1 was asked.
"They call it a glove contest.''
The court â What do you call it?
"I call them all prize-fights, out re
stricted by law. They are all amenable to
law, although they are called glove con
tests," was the reply.
â¢â¢'Are you a man of family?" asked Mr.
Kowalsky.
"I have a wife," replied Earp.
"Are you connected as a newspaper
writer with any of the newspapers?"
"No, sir."
"Have you been writing articles for
newspapers?' 1
"I object," exclaimed Mr. Barnes. But
Earp had already got his answer in, and
that was, "No; not now."
"Have you stated all your business?"
"That's all the business i have," was
the reply.
Earp then proceeded to deny that he had
had any interest in the light or had been
engaged in any plot to render an unjust
decision. He related the manner in which
he had been selected as referee. Gibbs
and Groom came to him and asked him to
referee, and, on his hesitating, Groom said
that it would be quite an honor to act as
referee on that occasion. Earp remarked
that probably "it would be a little bit of
tone to act as referee where the two best
men in the world were about to come
together," and he accepted. The matter
had never been mentioned to him before,
except on the day when he was returning
from a visit to Fitzsimmons' headquarters
in Sausalito. That was on the boat, and
Billy Jordan, in the presence of a crowd
of people, sai i that Earp would make a
good referee for the fieht, he (Jordan)
having seen Earp referee eight or ten good
fights.
Earp showed the first sign of irritation
during his examination when he was
asked as to the conversation which Julian
testified he had had with him.
"1 will say now," "aid Earp, pointing
a rigid hand toward Julian, who was sit
ting by Mr. Kowalsky's side, "that all that
Julian testified to the other day was a pack
of falsehoods."
The lawyer rose to his feet and asked
that the statement be stricken out. Then
Kowalsky said to the witness: "You have
a gun in your hind pocket whicn you
didn't lay on the taDle or hand over to
the clerk."
Earp smiled, while the spectators whis
pered until the noise grew into a buzz.
He replied quietly: "If there is a eun on
rue you can have the Deputy Sheriff search
me."
'When you went up to the stand," pro
ceeded Mr. Kowalsky, "you had some
thing in your hind pocket that looked like
a howitzer."
Earp smiled and made no further re
mark. His version of the conversation he
had with Julian was as follows: "Julian
said, % I have heard some very bad things I
reported about you. I have heard that
this thing is all fixed, and that the people
on the other side have got you.' I told
him that mere was nothing in it, as far as
I knew; that I would give him a fair,
square show, the hame as I would to Mr.
hftiarkey. Julian said, 'I am satisfied there
is nothing in tins report,' and he walked
off. That was all."
After the protest aeainst his acting as
referee had been made, Earp addressed
the spectators and aaid that he bad lived
five years in this community s.nd he
thought that no one would question his
honesty. He had come to referee the
fieht and to give a fair square decision.
He did not remember Ned Foster telling
him to let them go to the de'ace and ref
eree the fisht themselves.
â¢Mr. Kowalsky flared up very soon after
this testimony was given, when in answer
to a question Earp said that if there was
any Kindness in the world on his part it
was toward Fitzsimmons.
The lawyer jumped to his feet and in a
voice betraying some degree of agitation
asked:
"Was it kindness when you put your
bands against Sharkey's breast and pushed
him away and then put your fingers in
Fitzsimmons' eye?"
"No, sir,' 1 responded Earp promptly, "1
never did; aud I don't think Fitzsim
moti3 will say so."
"Don't you know that you put your
finger into the corner of his eye and cut
it?" was asked
"Never. I never put my hand on his
face at any tinle. I always put it on his
breast."
The witness after denying that he saw
Sharkey catch Fitzsimmons by the leg and
try to throw him, added: "If Sharkey had
caught Fitzsimmons by the legs and
wan ed to throw him he could have thrown
him clear off the stage."
"At the time that Sliarkey caught Fitz
simmons around the legs, did you hear
the audience cry 'shame' ana 'foul' and
'make them fight fair?' " was asked.
"No, sir; I never saw Sharkey catch
him around the legs."
"Didn't you hear Mr. Groom cryins:
'Mr. Referee, make Sharkey fight fair. He
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 16, 1896.
is fighting foul fifteen or twenty times?' "
"No, sir. Mr. Groom came to me be
tween rounds and said, 'Make them fight
fair; Sbarkey is fouling.' I said Fitzsim
mons was doing the foaling, ami cautioned
him. Then I went over to Sharkey and
cautioned him, also."
"Didn't Groom rush over to you and
say, 'No, no, not that man; go over to
Sharkey? 1 "
The witness had not observed anything
ol" that kind. Nee i ham called his atten
tion to his claimiijg the foul. Eurp gave
his decision, put on his hat and coat and
walked out with the certificate in his
pocket. Sharkey was in no condition to
receive it then.
The witness was asked as to whether he
had not called at the Baldwin Hotel and
asked to see Fitzsimmons, and whether
Clerk Clough had not informed him that
Fitzsimmons was in the cafe, and that if
Earp wished to see him he could send in
his card. Earp replied, with some feeling,
that nothing ot the kind ever happened,
that he had never asked for Fitzimmons,
and that Clerk Clough would not testify
to anything of the kind, and that the
statement was a falsehood.
Mr. Kowalsky objected to the defiant
manner of the witness, and said: "There
may be Â« nood many people afraid of this
man, but I don't believe that his threats
will put anybody tiown."
Mr. Barnes took a hand, and denied
that the witness had made any threats or
that his manner was threatening.
Then came the expose of the Examiner's
fake journalism.
"Have you made any statement to dif
ferent newspapers about this affair?" asked
Mr. Kowalsky.
"No, sir, not one," was the emphatic
reply. "The Examiner sent a reporter
out a few nights ago and I told him thai I
had nothing to say. You let them go on
and do their talking and 1 will do mine
afterward. Lots of them tried to get in
terviews with me, but that was the only
time I was interviewed."
Danny Needham gave his version of
tee fight, which tallied with that of
Sharkey.
Mr, Barnes announced that on to-mor
row morning at 10 o'clock he would move
to dismiss the complaint and dissolve the
injunction on the ground that the courts
had no jurisdiction over the matter.
"The case belongs to that class of sub
jects," he said, "which upon its face is
contra bonos mores, the same as betting
on dog-fighting or cock-fighting. It
should be thrown out of court inconti
nently."
Judge Sanderson said that he did not
grant the injunction without first reading
the complaint, and it disclosed nothing
upon its face except the affirmative alle
gation that the exhibition was held in
conformity to law, and he conld not take
into consideration any priza-fight or any
thing calculated to disturb the peace.
"It may be a difficult thing to dissolve
that injunction on the face of the com
plaint itself," added the Court. "If you
base ii upon the showing as to what kind
of a contest it was you will have a better
chance."
The counsel agreed that the official sten
ographer of the court, Mr. Foley, should
be appointed as a referee to take the re
mainder of the depositions. Judge San
derson will hear the arguments to-morrow
morning as to whether or not it was a
prize- fig lit.
LONG GREEN'S REVENGE.
Contemptible Attempt of the Ex
aminer Man to Browbaat a Los
Angeles Baseball Club.
LOS ANGELES, Cal.. Dec. 15.â "Long
Green" Lawrence of the Examiner has
found in the Tufts- Lyons baseball team
and their friends and counselors of this
cuv an aggregation of eentiemen who can
neither be cajoled, intimidated, coerced,
bulldozed nor biuffed into doing his bid
ding. These gentlemen are fully satisfied
there are such characteristics as principle,
honor and truth among men, and having
asserted these things they have the cour
age to maintain them.
Long Green, it seems, has been greatly
piqued at the way he was flayed on the
evening of the banquet here soon after the
return of the local team, given in their
honor for their handsome victory over
Long Green, the Alerts of AlameUa and
the Monograms of Portland. Tuis jour
nalisMc adventurer hus never lest an op
portunity s;nce the account of the banquet
was published in The Call to insinuate
that unless a retraction were forthcoming
from the team "they would get the worst
of it."
These threatening, insulting remarks
are now understood in baseball circles
here. It has been known f r some time
that negotiations were under way between
the Alerts and Tufts-Lyons to play a
series of games in San Francisco during
the holiday season.
Yesterday a message was received from
Long Green, signed by McNeil of tha
park where the cameÂ« were to be piayed,
saying that unless an apology was made
all arrangements for the games must be
considered off.
This contem ptible effort of Long Green to
browbeat an organization of gentlemen of
honor and decency rnto stultifying them
selves for the doubtful honor of crowing
bats with the pels of the Examiner â the
Alertsâ has failed ignominiously, and the
promised games will never be played, it
seems.
TRIED PISTOL AND BAZOR.
Martin Anderson, a Carpenter, Wanted
to Die, but He May Survive,
After All.
Martin Anderson, a carpenter, 32 years
of age, fired four b'.illets into lis scalp
yesterday morning and then cut his
throat with a razor, severing the wind
pipe, and yet he lives to tell the tale.
Anderson and a friend on Sunday last
engaged a room at 212 Minna st eet. "Yes
terday morning his roommate met Ander
son leaving the house about half-past 7
for breakfast.
Soon after Mrs. Gilligan, the landlady,
heard four shots and then Anderson
yelled to her from the top of the stairs to
go for a doctor as he had tried to kill
himself.
Mrs. Gilligan ran to a neighbor and he
summoned the patrol wagon and Ander
son was taken to the Receiving Hospital.
Dr. Bunnell stitched and dre-sed the
long, gaping wound in his throat and
then (Xiracted four bullets out of his
sculp. They were flattened just as if they
had hit a target. One of the bulle:s had
lr;Â»ctured the skull.
Notwithstanding the serious nature of
the '.wounds Dr..iJnnnell thought ; there
was a good chance of Anderson's recovery.
Anderson said; he wanted to die. He
had been sick for : about a 'month ; with
lung troubles, isnd as be had been unable
to work he suddenly took it into his head
to end his life. J He: had a revolver in his
trunk and be took it out, held it above his
head and tired the; four bullets into his
scalp. Thinking that none of the bullets
had found a fatal spot, he grabbed hold of
his razor and draw it across his throat.

much for him and a longing for life came

TO FIGHT THE
LAUREL HILL CUT
Richmond ites Against the
Sutter Street Exten
sion.
Will Make a Protest to the
Board of Supervisors
Next Week.
Stirring Speeches and Resolutions at
a Meeting cf Property-
Owners.
Those who think that there is no oppo
sition to the proposition to cut through
the Laurel Hill Cemetery for the purpose
of extending Sutter street should have at
tended the Richmond District prop.'rty
owners' meeting last evening.
Crossthwaite's Hall, on Fifth avenue,
was filled to the doors and nearly evory
one was most bitter against the alleged
improvement. Action to thwart the
scheme was taken before adjournment.
The speech of the evening was made by
James Bowlan, who in no unmistakable
language denounced the proposition as a
job of the rankest order on the part of the
Richmond District Association and the
Cypress Lawn Cemetery Association. C.
H. Hobb', a member of the former and
attorney for the 'atter, Mr. Bowlan said,
is ODe of the prime movers in the affair.
It is his purpo-e to serve tbe interests
of the San Mateo County cemetery people
and cause distrust m the minds of the
people. By this distrust he meant that
people will not be likely to invest in Laurel
Hill property while there ia a prospect of
having that burying-ground cut to pieces
and the graves of their dead converted
into sites for corner groceries, saloons or
dwelling-houses.
This distrust in that cemetery will cause
people to invest in the San Mateo County
properties instead. In otiier words, he
said, it is a proposition to rob the dead in
the interests ot the living. Mr. Fletcher
then introduced the following resolution,
which lie proposed should be presented' to
the Board of Supervisors. It was passed
without opposition :
Whereas, The Richmond District Improve
ment Association, a so-called improvement
club claiming to represent the property-own
ers of the .Richmond District, did take upon
themselves to petition th 6 iJtmrd of Supervis
ors of this Cf!y and County of San Francisco
to have Sutter street cut through the Laurel
Hill Cemetery, thereby causing au extra
heavy tax levy to be placed upon the shoulders
of the property-owners, many of whom are
struggling hard to pay off the mortgages upon
their homes, thus working an Injustice and
unnecessary hardship at the present time; and
whereas, the property-owners of the Rich
mond District were never consulted in
the matter; and whereas, the said petition
originated by said club is a scheme concocted
to benefit a cemetery in San Mateo County,
therefore be it
Resolved, That It is the sense of the prop
erty-owners here assembled that we hfartiiy
protest against any such extension of Sutter
street.
It was at once deciJed that the property
owners should send a strong committee to
the Board of Supervisors to present the
protest at the next meeting, and that sev
eral hundred property-owners of the Rich
mond District should be present to show
how much in earnest they really are. The
committee selected consists of George R.
Fletcher (chairman), L. G. McMullen, C.
R. Hawthorne, P. Filipini, James Barrett,
Edward Ginlev, T. A. Douglas, E. E.
Jones, Thomas Farrel and James Dever.
Tlie lollowing resolution communica
tion, to bs forwarded to President I.
Schwartz, was adopted witD a cheer:
To the Association of Improvement Clubs-
Gentlemen:
Whereas, the Richmond District Improve
ment Association, a self-constituted champion,
protector, guardian and custodian of the tax
payerb' interests ot the citizens of the Rich
inoud District, had the immaculate, gaudy,
unparalleled and daring nerve to petition the
Board of Supervisors to have Sutler street cut
through the Laurel Hill Cemetery without
consulting the property-owners in to rested
therein ; and whereas, the said job or intended
extension would bo detrimental to the prop
erty-owners concerned â especially by those
who are struggling to pay off mortgages and
trying to have a borne to call their mvn â by
the fact that the authorities would have
to levy extra heavy tax assessment
of at least $1,000,000 to accomplish
the required extension asked for by the said
petition unauthorized by us; and whereas,
the president of the above and aforesaid im
provement club did unnecessarily, uncom
promisingly and most persistently oppose the
extension of Post street some few years ago,
which would cost us one-twentieth of the
amount required for the extension of Sutter
street, wo would like to Know why this cnange
of heart; therefore be it
Rttoived, That the property- owners con
cerned, and directly concerned, in the exten
sion of Sutter street through the Laurel Hill
Cemetery do most emphatically oppose any
uch extension; and further be it
Resolved, That we earnestly ask the assist
ance and hearty co-operation of the San Fran
cisco Association of Improvement Clubs to
protect us from injustice, and appeal to them
for our just rights and demands.
C. R. Hawthorne gave some interesting
figures upon the project. He said it
would cost over $1,090,000 to do the work
contemplated and Richmond District prop
erty-owners would nave to pay an assess
ment of $2000 on every tifty-vara lot. The
cut w>-ula uoi. benefit any of th* property
owners and many would lose their homes
by not being able to stand such a tax.
Another lreetins will be held next Fri
day evening at the same place.

of Long Green Andy Lawrence, the man
aging editor, has resorted to absolute
falsehood.
When The Call stated that Health Offi
cer Lovelace had declared diphtheria to
be epidemic it told the truth. The health
officer's statement was that of individual
opinion, he having no right to make an
official declaration.
On the day following the publication of
the article, Secretary Godchaux of the
bonrd, without having consulUd hia su
perior, told an Examiner reporter that the
Board of Health had not declared diph
theria epidemic.
On tiii-* frail basis the Examiner pub
lished sensational stones in which The
Call was accused of faking. Its supreme
effort was published yesterday morning:,
when the following alleged interview with
Dr. Lovelace was published :
I was never interviewed by a representative
of The Call upon the diphtheria question. I
never said to a representative of The Call
that diphtheria was epidemic. The article in
The Call in which I am quoted us saying that
diphtheria is epidemic is simply a fake. There
is no truth whatever in it. There is a repre
sentative of The Call at the City Hail who
visits the Health Office upon his rounds. I
have not spoken to him for six months. Ido
not know whether he wrote the article or not.
That is immaterial, however, for the whole
thing is false. The Board of Health has never
declared diphtheria 10 bÂ« epidemic in '.his
City, and I never told any one from The Call
that it wag. Diphtheria is not epiuemic in
San Francisco.
From an interview which Dr. Lovelace
dictated to a Call reporter last evening
it is evident that the Examiner's inter
view was "strengthened," to say the least.
This i 3 what Dr. Lovelace said to the
Call reporter:
"I never said the disease had been de
clared epidemic, tliough I may have said,
and I think I did, that in my opinion
there were enough cases known in that
district to justify declaring the disease
epidemic. I never said ft was beyond
the power of tbe boafd to declare tlie dis
ease epidemic, for I believe they have a
perfect right to so declare."
The Call did not quote Dr. Lovelace as
saving that the disease had been declared
epidemic. It was his individual opinion,
and he admits that he was of that opinion.
The Call did not say that he had stated
that it was beyond the power of the board
to declare the disease epidemic.
Moreover, Dr. Lovelace declared yester
day moraine in the presence of witnesses
that the interview published in the Report
on last Thursday evening was practically
correct
In that case he was quoted as saying
that diphtheria was undoubtedly
epidemic.
As to th 6 Interview which the Examiner
"strengthened," Dr. Lovelace was asked
if he had been interviewed by a Call
reporter on the subject of diphtheria. He
replied that be had nor.
"They did not ask me as to the truth of
the diphtheria story," continued the
Health Officer, "and I did not volunteer
any information. The story as published
in the Report was practically correct, but
I did not give the story to any one from
'I he Call."
MELODY AND LITIGATION
Miss E Jen Beach Yaw's Box
Receipts Were Gar
nisheed.
Her Attorney Makes a Statement
Showing That tbe Whole Mat
ter Is a M stake.
While Miss Ellen Beach Yaw was send
ing her voice skyward Monday night and
trilling like a mocking-bird in a rice
swamp, this all happening at the Baldwin
Theater, an unfeeling garnishment was
filed against tbe box receipts. The amount
sought by the parties back of the process,
who are really the people connected with
the Musical Courier, was $1050 and this
was based on a claim for advertising Miss
Ya >v in the East last year.
Miss Yaw was happily unconscious of
the presence of a minion of the law in the
house. Maximilian Dick drew music
tranquilly from violin strings and Miss
Georgieila Lay, pianiste, attacked the
piano keys vigorously and with success
while the legal formalities were proceed
ing at tne box-office.
But yesterday Mr. Andrew, attorney for
Miss Yaw and C. P. Humphrey, counsel
for F. F. Cooper, to whom the claim had
been assigned, conferred, so that the heart
of Mr. Andrew was joyous last night, for
he anticipated that the money will be re
leased to-day. He also anticipated that
the case wiil come up for trial in Los An
geles, which is Miss Yaw's home.
Lust evening Mr. Andrew made a state
ment oi the facts, which seemed to show
that Miss Yaw was only innocently in
volved in the matter.
"It is this Wdy," said Mr. Andrew:
"Victor Thrane was Miss Yaw's manager
last year. JMiss Yaw came over from
London under engagement and she had
the distinct understanding with Mr.
Thrane t at she had no financial liability.
Sne had no money invested, bad no finan
cial interests in the receipts and was only
alarifeci. Mr. Thrane caused advertise
ments to be given to the Musical Courier.
I do not know anything about the fact,
but suppose that advertisements were
placed in that paper to the amount
named, but Miss Yaw had nothing at all
to do with authorizing them.
"I want to have it clearly understood
that if it shall be determined that if Miss
Yaw owes anything she is not only
willing but anxious to pay the debt. But
she does not owe anything. The persons
mentioned in the writ are Victor Thrane,
who is in New York, and H. W. Wachs,
in addition to Miss Yaw. I do not know
who Mr. Wachs is. That is all there is to
the matter, except that I would like to
Bay that Mr. Humphrey, the attorney, has
been very nice in the matter."

"WAR TO THE KNIFE"
QUOTH THE BOARD
Supervisors Will Bitterly
Contest the Last Elec
tion.
Declare That the Law Was
Violated by Precinct
Registration.
Attorney George H. Francoeur at
Work on a Complaintâ Suit to
Be Filed Soon.
"War to the knife."
This is the cry of the present or u old"
Board of Supervisors against the "new"
board, or those successful at the last elec
tion. The battle will take the form of a
suit to invalidate the whole of the last
election.
Some time aeo The Call announced
that the present Board of Supervisors
intended to contest the election of the
new board. The grounds on which it was
intended to make this contest were that
the board is not. exclusively a body to
govern tbe City, but the County as well,
and that under the County Government
act the members were entitled to hold
over privileges along with the Sheriff and
other county officers.
But now" the board has taken a new
tack. Consideration brought them to the
view that the position they had taken in
the matter was hardly tenable.
They have it at last. One of tbe members
dropped onto what seemed a feasiblecause
of action, communicated it to the rest and
immedia'ely great excitement reigned.
If the grounds on which the board in
tends to brine suit are tenable the result
will be nothing more or less than an in
validation of the whole of the last elec
tion. It is simply the hypothesis that
precinct registration is against the law,
and that by permitting it Registrar Hin
ton in effect cansed the whole election to
be illegal. This might cause every one of
the City and County ofiicers to hold over
for their respective terms.
A^out three weeks ago Attorney George
H. Francoeur was retained by the Super
visors to investigate tbe matter, and if in
his opinion he had a good case to bring
suit. Francoeur has been at work on a
complaint for three weeks and in all prob
ability will have it completed to-day.
When seen yesterday he said:
; 'Yes, the Board of Supervisors is going
to contest on the ground that precinct
registration was illegal, thus invalidating
the whole election.
"This is a very important matter, mean
ing if we are successful that none of the
person* winning at the last election can
take office, and we are accordinely work
ing slowly and carefully.
"I expect to have my complaint finished
to-morrow. We shall probably file suit in
a few days.

"JACK IN THE BOX."
A Misapplied Sobriqueti
Which Caused Some
Trouble.
WOMAN TO THE RESCUE.
A "Sagebrusher" Who Stood
With Much Patience Some
Very Cruel Sport.
In one of the large shoe factories of this
city a tale of patience, love and woman's
ability to do the rignt thing at the right
time has, through the City Hall marriage
records, recently found lieht. Here it is:
A young fellow from Nevada, who was a
shoe-cutter by trade and an expert at the
business, came down to this State in the
hope of being able to secure better em
ployment, and incidentally putting a few
extra shekels into his pockets. When he
had looked around he found that things
were not particularly lively in the shoe
traie, and "slim" is what his chances for
getting a good job seeinea to be. Many a
better man than Westâ for that ia the
"Sagebrusher's" name â has got discour
aged under les3 adverse circumstances
than he had to contend with, and that he
gave way to the "cup which cheers" â ana,
incidentally, kills â is not too surprising.
He had quite a little "stake," but drink
and things worse soon commenced to de
plete the hoard. He awoke to the fact
that he was setting ruined, and that only 1
added mental worry to a system whiiiM
had already been undermined bvdiseasÂ»~Â«
but 'that's another story." He had so^r
down to his last "clatter out of the box,"
as he facetiously terms it, when he go. a
job as a helper in a sawmill. It was work
ibat he was entirely unaccustomed to,
and his tired, weak and altogether un
strung nerves were unable to stand the
pressure. If he was spoÃen to be would
jump like a man shot; if a plank fell near
him he would shiver in fright; goin^j up
the stairway to the upper floor he could
scarcely hold on, and indeed his nerves
got into that condition that his fellow
workmen began to tease him and call btin
"Jumping Jack," and occasionally "Jack
in the Box" by way of variation. Luck
favored him one day. though, for he got
a position in tbe shoe factory above re
ferred to at his ol<i business, and of course
at a good increase in pay. But somehow
the sobriquet followed him into the shoe
factory, and "Jack in the Box" was rallied
and jeered about his wretched state of
nerves till further orders. One noou, how
ever, a change came ''o'er the o' the
dreams" of the brutes who tormented him
to the verge of insanity. An Irish girl
with beautiful bright auburn hair â some
times wrongly called redâ walked up to
the man whose bench was n.xt to West's
and remarked in a voice the meaning und
lorce of which could not be misunder
stoo I : "Jerry, if you're anything of a
man you stop that "JacK in the Box' talk
or I'll stop you. Mind me, an' if you
don't lick the next man that says it â why,
I will. And you bo. I can." That settled
it. No one yet had dared to offenu the
good-natured girl who had in this very
forcible way expressed her disapproval of
cruel chaff. But that wasn't all she did,
not oy a good deal. She lold him a lew
days after that she wanted to speak to
him, and though it was in a shame-faced
way, she said, "You're sick, ain't ye?"
"Well, I guess I'm rrett.v near dead," was
the awkward reply. "Who's doctoring
ye?" came next. "Nobody â quit doctor
ing." This in a very decided tone,
"-'lead this when you eet time. They
fixed my brother, and he had yive up
hope." What she handed him wa- one of
the circulars about the unquestioned
merits of the "Great Hudyan," whichx
the world-famed doctors oi the Hudson m
Medical Institute, at the corner of S'.ock- T
ton. Market and Ellis streets, send lite to
all inquirers.
The sequel is soon told. West is a per
fectly well man. He has been for months,
and the auburn haired Irish girl is a good
wife who no longer works in a facto: y.
Four months ago he went to tbe Chief
Consulting Physician of tbe Hudson Med
ical Institute and asked him ii he was well
enough to cet married. He was advised
to wait a little logger. Tbe permission
was given only a little while ago, and he
said in a half comical way to the great
specialist, "Whom do yon think I'm going
to marry ? " Of course the medical man
had no idea. "I'm getting tbe girl who
first sent me here â the girl who gave me
your circulars when they used to call me
"'Jack in the Box.'"

ON THE INCREASE
Given an Impetus by the
Visit of Mr. Hanna
to Canton.
It Is Certain, However, Tha
Port olios Have Neither Been
Offered Nor D?c!ined.
Two California Visitors to M jor M:-
Kin'.ey Urge James A. Waymire
for a Placs.
CANTON, Ohio., Dec. 15.â The visit of
Chairman Hanna to Canton to-day has
not in any way changed the Cabinet situ
ation so far as the public knows. There
is still ample reason to believe that no
portfolio has been tendered to a single
person and that consequently none has
been accepted or declined. Mr. Hanna
has not determined upon his own course.
He talked for an hour or more with Major
McKinley about his trip to the East and
' acquainted him with what had been done
in the way of arranging for the inaugural
ceremonies. Mr. Hanna returned to
Cleveland late this afternoon.
Charles G. Dawes of Chicago arrived
here this morning and will remain a guest
at the McKinley residence until to
morrow. When Major McKinley goes to
Chicago the last of the week he expects to
spend at least one day with Mr. and Mrs.
Dawes at their suburban home at
Evanston.
Lieutenant - Governor Saxton of New
York lunched with Major McKinley and
had a conference with him. The situa
tion in New York was discussed. Mr.
Saxton said later: "Thpre is no doubt
about the election of Mr. Platt to the Sen
ate. He will have a large majority of the
Republican votes in the Legislature. I
cannot say that New York ;s united on
any one for the Cabinet at present. There
are a number of men who would make
excellent Cabinet officers. So far as 1
know, there is no popular movement in.
iavor of any of them. Mr. Morion is out
of the race."
Brutus J. Clay discussed Kentucky poli
tics with Major McKiniey to-day.
"The trouble with Kentucky is that we
have too many good Republicans who
want to z.o to tbe Senate to succeed Black
burn. Governor Bradley ought to po to
the Senate because he has, in my opinion,
done the most for the party; but what, is
most important is that some Republican
should go.
"Major McKinley impressed upon me
tho idea that it would not at all do to lose
that seat in the Senate when we have
such a good chance to get it. His notion
is that we ought to sink all personal am
bition and animosity for tbe personal
good of the party and country."
C. O. Burton of San Francisco and Dr. J.
T. McLain of Alameda, Cal., talked of
Cabinet possibilities on the Pacific Slope
with Major McKinley. Dr. McLain urged
Judge J. A. Waymire with great earnest
ness and declared that his appointment to
the Cabinet would be a good thing for the
party and country.
Among other callers were ex-Lieutenant-
Governor Lyon ol Ohio/who wanted to be
Minister to Bolivia; ex-Secretary of State
D. J. Ryan of Columbus Ohio, and ex-
Lieutenant-Governor Willcumbach of In
diana.
POPULAR VOTE FOR PRESIDENT.
JtcKin'ey's Pluraliti/ Cm the Xatiun la
000,790.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 15â The can
vass of the vote of New York State to
day practically completes the official vote
by t tates and makes it possible for the
first time to tabulate the popular vote for
President. With the exception of Utah
and South Dakota, wnere the courts have
ordered' the revision of the completed re
turns, tbe final vote of all the States has
been collected by the United Associated
Presses. In Texas the State canvassing
board declared the vote without waiting
ior the returns from six small counties.
These have been estimated and added to
the result in that State.
The total vole cast was 13,924,653. This
was 1,813,124 more than the total vote of
1892. McKinley received 7,109,480 and
Bryan 6,508.681, a plurality for McKinley
of 600,799. The vote for Bryan and Se
wall and that for Bryan and Watson is
combined in the total vote given for
Byran. Only twelve States reported a
separate vote for Brvan and Watson. His
aggregate vote was 46,879. The sound
money Democratic vote ior Palmer and
Buckner was 132,056. The Prohibition
vote for Levering was 127,174. The Na
tional or free-silver Prohibitionists cast
13,320 votes for Bentley. Matchett, the
candidate of the Socialistic Labor party,
received 33.942.

In Jtoaton the llepublicant Get All Seven

BOSTON, Mass., Djc. Id.â Returns from
the city election are coming in very slowly;
only about ten of the twenty-five wards
are complete at midnight. From the fig
ures already at hand it looks as though
thpÃepublicansnadelected all seven of the
Aideimen who were voted for to-day. The
city has voted for license, but the major
ity cannot be ascertained. John H.
Duane (D.) is elected a Street Commis
sioner over Benjamin M. Cramp (R.) by a
small majority.
Returns from outside cities throughout
the State where municipal elections are
held show Republicans holding their posi
tions.
Up to 1 o'clock all but nine precincts
had been reported, but the footings for all
â¢andidates were not made until consider
ably later. The Republicans gained one
Alderman over last year. The Common
Council will stand 41 Democrats to 34 Re
publicans against 45 Democrats and 30
iW'iillicans tliisyear.
LINCOLN, Nebe., Dec. 15.â The news of
the result of the city election at Lynn.
Mass., was received with considerable
satisfaction by Mr. Bryan to-night. In
view of the fact that two factories in the
Massachusetts town had cut their wages
since election, the change in sentiment,
Mr. Bryan thinks, is not remarkable.
Upon receipt o! the news', Mr. Bryan sent
the following telegram to the Mayor-elect
of the famous shoe town: "Accept con
gratulations. Lynn has at last put its
thoe on the right foot."

MRS. COURT EN AY IS INSANE.
General Cutting's Daughter to Have a
Guardian Appointed for Her Per
son and Estate.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 15.â An in
quiry was made by a sheriff's jury and Dr.
Austin Flint as commissioner to-day into
t c sanity of Mrs. Isabella Cutting Courte
nay, an aliened incompetent. The ques
tion of the value of her property waÂ» also
inquired into.
Mr-. Courtenay is the daughter of Gen
era' Cutting of San Francisco. She was
married in 1891 to Harold Courtenay, an
i actor, and they went at once to Italy.
j There, six weeks after their marriage,
Mrs. Courtenay showed siens of insanity,
I and was placed by her husband in a pri
j vate asylum.
General Cutting and his wife went to
I the Isle of Wight, England, when they
i heard of their daughter's plight, and an
â¢ arran cement was afterward entered into
i between them and Courtenay by which,
for tbe consideration of paying him $125 a
! month he was to give up all claim to his
wife. She was then taken to the Isle of
Wight and placed in the custody of her
; aunt, Mary Patterson, where she is at
i present.
The testimony of Mrs. Conrtenay's

LOUD ARGUES HIS
NEW POSTAL BILL
By Amending the Law the
Government Can Save
Millions.
Proposes to Cut Off Free Trans
portation of Sample Copies
and Serial Matter.
Considerable Time Used Up in Talking
About the Atlantic and Pacific
Railroad
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 15.â The
House to-day rather unexpectedly en
tered upoii the consideration of the bill of
Loud (R. ) of California to amend the
postal law relating to second-clas3
mail matter, and it was the unfinished
business when adjournment occurred at
4:30 o'clock. It was not taken up without
opposition, however. Bingham (R.) of
Pennsylvania and Quigg (R.) of New
York, pleading want of notice, endeav
ored to postpone action, but by decisive
votes ths House rejected all efforts to de
lay the proceedings, and Loud opened the
debate. He characterized the bill as the
most important measure that would come
before Congress at this sessionâ one whose
disposition might involve the question of
an issue of bonds by the new administra
tion. By shutting nut of tiie mails, as the
bill provided, of serial novel publications
and "sample copy" newspapers, the Gov
ernment would save from $20,000,000 to
$40,000,000 a year and make the postal
service not only self-sustaining, but on
the basis of present operations a source of
profit.
By unanimous consent the following
bills were considered: House bill to
amend an act of the Fifty-third Congress
so as to reduce from fifty to forty feet the
open space about the Government build
ings. Passed.
Senate bill subjecting vessels of fifteen
tons;or more, propelled by gas, naphtha or
electricity, and carrying passengers for
hire, to the regulations governing steam
and sail craft as to inspection of hulls and
boilers and the employment of pilots, etc
Laid over on objection.
The Speaker announced EvanS (R.) of
Kentucky. Russell (R.) of Connecticut
and McMillin (D.) of Tennessee as con
lerees on the part of the House in the
joint resolution extending the limit of the
joint Congressional committee to in
vestigate the subject of regulations for the
free use of alcohol in tbe arts aud manu
factures.
Under the agreement made last week
Powers (R.) of Vermont called up the
bill to define rights and privileges of pur
chasers of the Atlantic and Pacific Rail
road and franchises, under foreclosure of
the mortgage authorized to be placed on
the property by the act of 1871. Powers
explained the necessity for the proposed
legislation. He said tbe bill gave the new

corro/ation no privilege not possessed by
the old company, and held it to a strict
fulfillment of all its obligations.
An amendment offered by Moody (R.)
of Massachusetts was agreed to. limiting
the issue of stock to the amount of the
unpaid mortgage debt at the time of the
sale, and providing that additional stock
may be issued with the approval of the
Secretary of the Interior for cash paid in
and limited to $100,000,000.
A letter was read from Joseph H. Call,
special United States Attorney, in litiga
tion against t c Pacific railroad compa
nies, urging the passage of the bill. It
sufficienUy guarded the interests of the
Government, and the prompt reorganiza
tion of the company was demanded in
justice to the people along tue line of the
road.
McÃae (D. )of Arkansas proposed a sub
stitute for the Senate bill, going into
minute detail, to enforce the liabilities and
obligations of the Atlantic and Pacific
Railroad Company upon the successor
company and requirine the sale of all
lands within its rrants whenever a "rea-
Bonable price" is offered.
Pending consideration of the bill the
legislative, < xecutive and judicial appro
priation bill for the year ending June 30,
1898, was reported and placed on the cal
endar.
McÃae, supporting his substitute for
the penaing bill and in answer to ques
tions by membeis as to the necessity of
all tho provisions lie had set forth, said
that if the House wanted to protect the
creditors of tho Atlantic and Pacific Rail
road, its workingman and others, it would
put it in the bond, "for," be said, '*the
history of the corporation for forty years
shows that it has violated every pledge it
ever undertook to Keep."
McÃae'a substitute was rejectedâ ayes
I 70, noes 163.
An amendment to the committee biil
was agreed to requiring the new company
to become incorporated in the several
States through which its line runs.
Cooke (11.) of Illinois moved an amend
ment requiring tha purchasers as a prece
dent to organize within six months of the
passage of the bill and before it shall take
effect to file with the Secretary of the In
terior a relinquibhrnent of all claim to
I that part of the land adjoining the
I incompleted portion of the road.
Powers said that a suit to enforce the
forfeiture of the unearned land grant had
been instituted and was to-day being
argued in the Supreme Court of the
United States. He did not think the com
pany should be blackmailed before per- j
mission to incorporate was granted. The j
amendment was agreed to â "8 to 43 â and j
the biil thÂ»n passed.
Loud (R ) of California moved that the
House go into committee of the whole
upon his bill to exclude from the mails as
second-class matter sample copies of news
papers, books, periodicals, etc.
Quigg (R.) of New York moved to ad
journ, out the House refusedâ lo2 to 134 â
to adjourn.
The House went into committee of the
whole on the mail c!assincat ; on bill.
Loud opened the deDate in favor of the
bill by describing it as the most important
measure that would come before the
House. As early as 1887 the officials of
the Postofflce Department saw the abuses
likely to occur under the law of 1885,
which gave these publications the right ol
admission to the mails, and the report of
the Postmaster-General of that year and
for every succeeding year had recom
mended to Congress the reform contained
in the bill. The transmission of this class
of matter. Loud said, cost the Government I
at least I-.'0.000.000, ami Postmaster-Gen
eral Wanamaker had estimated the cost to
be not less than $40,000,000. The passage
of the bill, he siid, would be opposed on j
sentimental and educational grounds, but
he wanted to ask the House woula the
members now be willing, as an original
proposition, to vote for the next ten years
$240,000,000 for pducational purposes and
those purposes wholiy outside of the con
trol of Congress?
The transportation of these articles
through the mails the past ten years, he
said, has cost $240,1)00,000. The cost to the
Government of carrying this class of mat
ter was not less than 12 cents a poundâ 1
Santa Clans is giv-
ing toys to all little
child v c n malting
purchases on our sec-
ond floor.
the rate charged by the Government was
1 cent a pound. In competition with the
Government for this class of business,
Lnid said, the express companies were i
getting the short haul; and the Govern
ment the lorn: haul within a radius ot 500
miles, the express companies get the busi
ness, charging 1 cent a pound; over that
distance the publishers dump their load
upon the Government mail for transmis
sion. And it had been carried, Loud said,
at an expense of $1 85 a pound.
Continuing, Loud said that the chief
opposition to the bill would be directly
toward the sample-copy matter. He con
sidered the abuses arising under that
privilege a3 more serious than the serial
publication abuse. Many newspapers, he
said, were loth to surrender thti privileges
they possess undsr the present law. The
opposition, he said, would come from
publications whose existence was made
possible by the "sample-copy" features
of the present law.
Without action the committee rose, and
at 4:30 o'clock the House, on motion of
Loud, adjourned.

POOLROOM LAW
IS KNOCKED OUT
Decision That Means a
Death- Blow to Racing
in Missouri.
Outlawed Tracks Cannot Stand
the Competition of Downtown
Gambling Resorts.
And the Big Sprin? and Summer Meet
ing at the Fair Grounds Will
Also Be Crippled.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Dec. 15.â 1n a decision
rendered to-day by the Supreme Court at
Jefferson City the poolroom law of 1895 is
declared unconstitutional, and the State
of Missouri is now without a race-betting
law. The decision was based on an appeal
of Thomas Walsh of St. LouK who was
sentenced to pay a fine of $1000 for con
ducting a poolroom in this city. The
effect of the decision will be to reopen all
poolrooms, which have been closed during
the last two years, and will also result in
tbe abandonment of two winter race
tracks now in operation here, as the own
ers declare they cannot compete with
poolrooms.
The judgment of the State Supreme
Court to-day that the anti- poolroom law
under which Tom Walsh was convicted
and sentenced to a fine in this city is un
constitutional is believed to be a death
blow to racing in Missouri. Both of the
outlawed tracks will close winter racing
at once, as they could not last a week
against tne competition of downtown
poolrooms.
The big spring and summer meeting at
the fair grounds will also be crippled.
Al Spink of the South Side track said:
"A poolroom gets more money in one day
than a winter track does in a week, so
that there can be no question as to the
result.
"The decision shows, however, that It is
almost impossible to make a case, so that
poolroom people are going to take tbe
chance of getting through the courts as
Walsh did. To my miad it just reopens
poolrooms and kills off tbe raciug in Sr.
Louis."
President C. C. Maffitt of the Fair
Grounds Association said: "The tracks
will have to stop operations and the old
fair grounds will be sold out and cut up
into town lots. The poolrooms attract
the crowds and keep people enough away
from our tracks to make the tracks close."
STOCKTON DRIVING CLUB.
Owners of Ihorourjhbred Stock Will
Build n Speed Track.
STOCKTON, Cal., Dec. 15-â A gentle-
men's driving club was formed here to-
night. One of the objects of the associa
tion is the building of a good speed track
for the use of tbe members. It is be
lieved that the soil of the reclaimed land
will be just the thing, and very likely the
road will be built on the old Moss tract.
John Boggs of Colusa, who owns a large
slice of that tract, has offered the club
free of charge the right of way for a road
100 feet wide and extending from near the
junction ot South and Madison streets in
this city west to the San Joaquin River, a
distance of about a mile and a half.

COULD NOT SELL HIS COFFINS.
But Poor Old James Lindsay Was Placed
at Final Rest in One of His
Own Workmanship.
PATERSON. N. J., Dec. 15. â James
Lindsay, who died in the Almshouse on
(Saturday, was buried from the undertak
ing establishment of John F. Smith on
Main street yesterday afternoon. He was
a coffin-maker and first gained notoriety
in this section by the legend which
adorned his little Bhop on Barbosa street
which reads:
"Coffins made and repaired. Light ones
for silk- weavers. Strong ones for country
people."
The old man was buried in a coffin he
made for himself some ten years ago. It
was a rough affair, painted black, with red
and white stripea running; around it.
There was an opening Bxll inches in the
upper part of the lid, in which was fitted
a picture of Lindsay, taken with a bull
dog, his companion for many years. A
rough plate of brass inscribed with his
name was also fitted on the coffin. He
was very prond of this piece of workman
ship, and used to say : "I'll have that at
my death. They can't bury in a pauper's
box."
It is supposed that Lindsay slept in this
cotfin, as there was no sign of a bed in his
shop, which was also his living apartment.
The place was filled with coffins, but Lind
say kept his pet apart from the others and
covered it with white muslin. He was
never known to make a sale of any of his
wares, and although visitors came from a
considerable distance to view his quÂ«er
habitation, there were no investors among
them.
Finally, after struggling hard to make a
living, he gave up the job and went to the
Almshouse a year ago, at the a^e of 68.
When he left his shop he intrusted John
Dodd, a New-street saioon-keeper, with
the care of his coffin, telling him to keep
it until he died. The dead man's son,
James F. Lindsay, was the only mpurner.
The body was buried in Laurel Grove
Cemetery.
SONS MURDER THEIR FATHER.
Antonio Jeroio Becomes the Victim of
Offsprings Probably Crazed by a
Death in the Family.
SOUTH VINELAND, N. J., Dec. 15.â
A horrible tragedy occurred near here
yesterday. Antonio Jeroio, aged 65 years,
was brutally murdered by his son Tony.
The Jeroio family wa? composed of old
man Jeroio and four sons â Antonio,
Nicholas, Louis and Charles.
Three weeks ago Nicholas died, and
since that time the family has been acting
very strangely. About two weeks ago the
two younger sons were arrested and sent
to jail for disturbing the peace by con
tinually praying around ttie Catholic
churches. Their time having expired,
they were liberated on Saturday last and
returned to their home.
They celebrated their release by brutally
attacking their father, whom they drove
away from the house. He returned yester
day, and upon entering the house was
thrown into the cellar where he was again
attacked by. his three sons. He managed
to break from his captors and fled across
the fields, closely pursued by Antonio,
who overtook him about 100 yards from
the house and hit him over tbe head with
a cordwood stick, felline him to the
ground and killing him instantly. Jeroio's
head was mashed to a jelly and his brain
oozed from the wound.
Tne only cause for the crime is that
Antonio became crazed with grief over
the loss of his brother and committed the
horrible murder as a sacrifice, as he
claimed such a sacrifice would restore the
lost relative. He admits the killing. An
inquest was held to-day.
SLAVE TRADE IN AFRICA.
Lecturer Chatelain Says the Barbarous
Traffic Tet Exints.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 15.â Heli
Chatelain, a traveler in the Dark Contin
ent, lectured before the American Geo
graphical Society at Chickering Hall last
evening on the "Internal Slave Trade in
Africa."
" If any one thinks that slave trade is a
thing of the past," he said, "he is mis
taken. Among the 200,000,000 of people
in Africa, at least 50,000,000 are slaves. The
first slave caravan that 1 saw had twenty
naked women. The leader told me that
fifty of his lot had died on the way to the
coast."
The lecturer showed a picture of a slave
so fastened that he could not move a limb
or turn his face from the broiling sun
that beat on it. He also showed pictures
of slaves who had been abandoned to die
along the caravan roads.

son, a cigarrnaker, 42 years old, is under
arrest here on the charge of being one of
the gang which tried to rob the Iron
Mountain train in this city December 9.
The prisoner admits he was around the
railway yards tne night of the crime, and
the police have a man who saw Jackson at
Tower Grove station a short time before
the holu-up, and who alleges he saw some
sticks of dynamite in Jackson's possession.
Four other men, who are said to belong to
the Bates-street gang, were also brought
to police headquarters to-day on suspicion
oi being part of the train-robbing gang.
Edward Clarke Pardoned.
HELENA, Mont., Dec. 15.â Edward
Clarke and his wife, who were serving a
term of : seventeen years , each for the
poisoning of John P. Stewart, have been
pardoned by Governor Rickards after i be
ing in prison one year. Stewart was rich
and suspicion 'ell on his wife, who was ar
rested at Spokane and tried at Missonla.
To save herself she ; accused ; her mother
and stepfather, who were convicted, by
her testimony, of murder in the second
decree., Mrs. Stewart, however, stricken
with remorse, confessed to an attorney
and to ex-Governor Toole, but committed
suicide before a written statement could
be signed.

DELEGATE POMEROY
LOSES HIS SEAT
Cannot Attend the Session
of the Federation of
Labor. \
Owes the Illinois Branch and
Issued a Circular on
Politics.
Two Open Violations of the Order's
Constitution That the Leaders
Otj ct To.
CINCINNATI, Ohio, Dec. 15.â The sec
ond day's session of the American Federa
tion of Labor was called to order this
morning by President Gompers. who
yielded tbe chair to Vice-President Mc-
Guire ot Philadelphia. The auditing com
mittee reported they had examined the
accounts of officers and found them cor
rect. Ths case of Delegate Ryan of the
Tin-cornice Workers was taken from the
committee on credential and referred to
the committee on grievances.
At the afternoon session . the case of
William C. Pomeroy was taken up. Pom
eroy's seat is contested by E. 0. Wood
bnry of Chicapo, on tiie ground that
Pomeroy owes $388 to the Illinois State
Federation of Labor. He is also charged
with violating the constitution of the
Federation of Labor by issuing a circular
in the interest of a political party, bearing
his signature as general organizer of the
Federation ot Labor, and this seemed to
be the real nut which the convention had
to crack.
Pomeroy's defense on the first charge is
that the money to pay tho claim is on de
posit, but payment has been delayed by
attachment and that the amount will be
turned over as soon as pending litigation
is concluded. On the second charge he
sets up as a defense that tlie circular was
issued in consequence of and to offset the
effect of a circular previously issued in the
interest of another political party and
signed by John McÃride as ex-president of
the American Federation of Labor. Owing
to an accident by which he badly wrenched
his ankle Pomeroy was unable to be in at
tendance at the convention while his case
was being acted on.
A motion was made that the credentials
of Mr. Pomeroy be rejected. On motion
the charges preferred by the Illinois State
Federation were ordered read before the
couvention.
Delegates Ed O'Donnell of Central Labor
Union, Boston; John B. Lennon of Jour
neymen Tailors' Union of America, and
Vice-President O'Connell made speeches
against the admission of William C. Pom
eroy as a delegate, confining their re
marks to the political aspect of the case
and condemning in unmeasured terms his
action In issuing a political partisan circu
lar, which he signed as organizer of the
American Federation of Labor.
Speeches along the s:;me general line
were made by E. O. Woodbury of the Illi
nois State Federation, Thomas I. Kidd of
the Illinois State Federation and David
Kregling of the St. Louis Trades and
Labor Council. The three latter also re
ferred to the charges from the Illinois
oranch and stigmatized Pomeroy as a de
fauiter and his defense that payment of
the claim against him was prevented by
litigation as false and unfounded. They
held that the withholding of the money
was only one violation of the constitu
tion, and that there were others; that in
fact Pomeroy had acted in bad faith with
the Illinois branch throughout his deal
ings with it.
James Duncan of the Granite-cutters'
National Union, after a speech in which
he called attention to the fact that the ob
jection was against tne man and not
against the organization issuing his
credentials, moved that the credentials be
approved, the delegates seated and the
matter referred to the Chicago Hotel and
Restaurant Alliance for action.
The debate, which had taken on a some
what exciting aspect, was cut short by a
motion for the previous question, which
had many prompt seconds.
The amendment was voted down by an
overwhelming majority and the previous
question was then called for. It was that
the credentials be rejected and William C.
Pomeroy retused a seat in the convention.
The roll was called and resulted in a vote
of 1976 ayes aud 196 noes.
The convention then adjourned until 9
a. m. to-morrow.
PROTECT ION FOR PRODUCTS.
California ConoresMnte* Looking After
Inlerrntit of the State.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Dec. 15.â
Although Judge Maguire has been much
talked of for assignment to the Ways and
Means Committee, vice Judge Crisp of
Georgia, deceased, he has not been and is
not now a candidate for the place.
Speaker Reed is reported in an interview
as declaring that no Democrat "who is
addicted to the free-silver habit" will be
assigned to the Ways and Means Commit
tee. He will appoint some gold-bug
Democrat.
The California delegation will in a few
days have a meeting to consider tbe tariff,
the Ways and Means Committee having,
at its meeting this morning, set Monday,
December 28, for a hearing of those inter
ested in the manufacture of wines and
spirits. On Tuesday, January 5, the com
mittee will hear the agriculturists, which
includes the fruit-growers.
Several members of the California dele
gation will appear before the committee
at these hearings in ndvocacy of a pro
tective tariff on California products.
Representative Barham will probably
speak for the wool-growers and lumber
men. Bowers will urge that a higher
duty be placed upon oranjres, lemons,
raisins, almonds and other products of his
section. Bowers is especially anxious to
accomplish what he can during the re
mainder of his Congressional term, for
his successor, Dr. Castle, is a rank free
trader. Judge Maeuire, it is needless to
say, will not join his colleagues, but will
at the proper time appear before the com
mittee and urge that coal and iron be
put UDOn the free list.
NEITRRE BILL WILL PASS.
So the Pacific Cable Rivalry It All in
VÂ«in.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec.
sentative Loud has introduced tne bill
prepared by Colonel Z. S. Spaulding for a
Pacific cable. The bill is similar to that
already published in The Call, with tne
exception of ' a paragraph in addition
â¢which provides that the Pacific Cable
Company of New Jersey, in consideration
of a $60,000 subsidy from the United States
Government for the line to Honolulu and
$200,000 for the line from Honolulu to
Japan, thence to Australia, shall not be
obligated to fulfill this contract made with
tlie Postmaster-General until the other Gov
ernments interested shall grant subsidies
of like amount. Colonel Spaulding be
lieves that the Scrymser people constitut
ing the rival New York company, which
also has a bill pending before Congress are
only seeking to obstruct the passage of nis
own measure. He alleges that Mr. Scrym
ser is backed by the Western Union Tele
graph Company and John W. Macsay of
the Postal Telegraph and Cable Company.
It is not believed that either bill will pass
this Congress.

WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 15.-The
United States to-day won its suit against
the Oregon and California Railroad Com
pany and the Oregon Central Railroad
Company for possession of land within the

Forest Grove, Or., is the center, within a
radius of twenty miles, which was orig
inally granted to the Oregon Central Rail
road Company and forfeited by act of Con
gress for failure to complete the line as
proposed. The Oregon Central disposed
of its rights to the Oregon and California
Company, and both were made defendants.
The Circuit Court for the Ninth Circuit
gave judgment for the United States, but
the Court of Appeals reversed it. The Su
preme Court of the United States, in an

tained tne Circuit Court.
CRIMINAL CASES SUSTAINED.
Three Appeal* From Washington Blade
to the Supreme Court in Vain.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 15.â Three
appeals in criminal cases from the State
of Washington were disposed of in the
Supreme Court of the United States to
day by Chief Justice Fuller, the defend
ants in the several cases all being worsted.
They were those of Adolph Krugg, a
defaulting County Treasurer; Henry
Creamer and Charles W. Nordstrom, con
victed of murder and sentenced to death.
The defendants asserted as grounds for
reversing the judgments of the State
courts that criminal proceedings could
not be instituted and prosecuted by in
formation, but must be upon indictment
by the Grand Jury. The Supreme Court
of the United States decided that the
grounds were not wel! taken, and affirmed
the Nordstrom case, which was argued
last week and dismissed with tbe others.
ARMY APPROPRIATION BILL.
Amounts Foot Up Lest Than the Sum
Recommended by Lantont.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 15.â The
army appropriation bill was reported to
the House this afternoon. It carries an
appropriation af $23,126,344, which is about
$766,000 less than the estimates of the Sec
retary of War and $158,000 below the appro
priation for the present year. No provi
sion is made for the Army and Navy Hos
pital at Hot Springs, Ark., as the Secretary
of War recommended that it be transferred
to tbe Interior Department to be rented.
The Secretary explains that the number
of patients at the nospital is so small that
they are practically no more numerous
than the attendants, and under the cir
cumstances it would be cheaper for the
Government to board the patients at a good
hotel.

ACTOR SALVINI
DIES AT FLORENCE
Had Suffered for Several
Months From Organic
Troubles.
Career of the Brilliant Alexander,
Son of Tomasso, the
Tragedian.
Educated Abroad for tbe Life of au
Engineer, He Made a Hit in This
Country on the Stage.
ROME, Italy, Dec. 15.â Alexander Sal
vini, the well-known actor, died at Flor
ence at 9 o'clock this morning. He had
been iil some time.
Mr. Salviiii has been suffering for sev
eral months with an organic trouble and
in the early part of October his condition
was so serious as to give rise to a rumor
of his death.
A lew months ago Mr. Salvini married
Miss Maud Dixon, tbe leading woman of
his company, who was at his bedside
when he died.
Alexander Salvini, the son of the Italian
The Late Alexander Salvini.
tragedian, Tomasso Salvini, was born in
Rome on December 21, 1861. He went to
school at Naples, Florence and Genoa and
in Switzerland, afterward entering a tech
nical school in Florence. It was intended
that be should become an engineer. In
1881 he came to America with Charles
Chizzola, the manager of Rossi's Ameri
can tour, and instead of looking up a place
as an engineer as he bad intended went
with Rossi's company for a considerable
part of the tour.
Young Salvini then settled in New York
and studied English so that he could speak
it on the statro. His first attempt was in
Clara Morris' company, which was playing
at the Union-square Theater. He then
spent two seasons with Margaret Mather.
ln 1885 the elder Salvini came to Amer
ica and his son joined hia' company. It
was, however, in 188G when Mr. Palmer
engaged him for his company at the
Madison-square Theater^hat he won most
of the favor that he found with theater
goers of New York. After three seasons
at the Maiftson-square Theater he again
joined his father in a tour of the country.
When his father returned to Europe he
began his starring tour.
Young Salvim was to have made a tour
of this country this season, opening in
Cleveland, Ohio, in September last in
"The Three Guardsmen." All of his en
gagements were canceled, however, early
in the season, when word of his illness
was sent to his manager, W. W. Wilkin
son of New York City.

tified that beiore his death, which resulted
from pneumonia, Kast declared that
everything he had said regarding Earl
Russell was true. Lord Russell's solicitor,
who was present at the inquest, protested
against the admission of this testimony.

â¢ . SAN DIEGO, Cal.. Dec. 15.â Mexican
advices state that President Diaz and
party relumed to the capital last Thurs
day nfler an eventful trip to Guadalajara.
Ameca and Lake Chapala. The return to
ihe_ capital was the occasion of a great
turnout of high civil and military officers,
who greeted the chief magistrate and con
gratulated him upon his narrow escape
froni drowning on Lake Chapala the pre
vious night.
A* a part of the festivities in honor of
the President there was a banquet on the
island of Mexacala, in the lake. A lar^e
arty of military men. and state and
Rational officials went over in tugs and
Vaunches. The occasion was one of great
Splendor, and the Americans present said
it was one of the happiest entertainments
planned for the relaxation of General
Diaz. At the conclusion of the supper
General Diaz and party boarded a small
tugboat in order to reach Ocotlan station,
where a special train awaited them.
Among those in the Presidential party
were: Joaquin Baranda, Secretary of
Justice; Francisco Z. Mens, Secretary of
Communications; Colonel Fernando Gon
â z'ales, aid-de-camp to General Diaz: and
â¢Governor Juan Manuel Flores of the State
cf Durango.
*â¢ When they were about half-way across
to Ocotlan a tremendous storm came up
anfl-the waters of the lake were lashed
into a fury. A tropical rain accompanied
tlie windstorm, with lightning and thun
der. .The little tug kept straight on, fac
ing the blast, but it became apparent that
the vessel was in danger of capsizing
under the seas that attacked her. Colonel
Gonzales was much alarmed for the safety
of the party and urged returning to the
island, but the President insisted upon
going ahe&d. This state of affairs lasted
tor two hours, the storm increasing in
stead of diminishing in intensity until,
nt every fresh onslaught of the waves, the
party gave up hope of reaching the shore
in the vessel. ,
" Serious consultations were held regard
ing,'the advisability of leaving the tug and
making for shore in life-preservers, and it
13 stated that General Diaz himself finally
reached that view. But after a fearful
battle the little teg managed to get into
the lee of a range of hills near Ocotlan,
and thus ran to that town in comparative
safety, arriving at 1 o'clock Thursday
rooming.
, The President's party boarded the spe
cial and returned direct to the City of
Mexico. __^^_^_^_^^_

ABDUCTED FROM STOCKTON.
â  In Defiance of a Divorce Court Decree a
Father Spirits His Child Away
From Is Home.
" STOCKTON, Cal, Dec. 15.â Social
circle:* are ail agog over a case that came
up, before Judge Smith this afternoon.
- Tbe persons interested in it are highly
connected here. Harold Albertus Dap
gett, a toddling child, was brought before
â¢ Judge Smith on a writ of habeas corpus
â¢ taken out by his mother, Mrs. A. M.
'. Noble, to recover possession of the little
â¢â¢one from his father. W. A. Dageett, for
' mer'.y cf this city. The writ was applied
for yesterday by Attorney de Vnes and
w.as granted by Judge Smith. Deputy
. Sheriff Robinson left yesterday for San
. Francisco, whither the child had been re
moved by the father, and the officer,
â¢ lather and son arrived in Stockton to
-day. The bab 2 was brought in. o court in
'â¢tsbedience to the writ.
About a year aco Mrs. Noble was di
vorced from Dacgett, and only recently
caarried A. M. Noble, a capitalist of this
\city. Sinca hi.i divorce Mr. Daggett has
been traveling for a rubber bouse, and a
Jew days ago received his Christmas vaca
tion. He came to this city last Sat
urday, an<l, in accordance with his usual
; practice, sent a note to Mrs. Noble stating
that he desired to see the child. He had
thiÂ« riirht under the decree, which gave
him permission to see the little one at all
reasonable hours.
Upon receipt of the note. Mrs. Nob'e
sÂ«>nt !h<Â» child to the office of A. A. Dudley,
Daggett's lorrner partner, accompanied by
jhe. nurse. There Mr. Daggett met the
child and spent tbeday with him. Shortly
:if:er 3 o'clock he left, the office with the
boy and wa ked a few steps eastward.
' \\ hen the nurse asked where tie was j:oing,
'he .replied that he was takine the child
into'Cohn's fruitstore to buy him some
candy, and the nurse paid no further a:
'.tention to him for some timp. Instead of
buying tile candy, the father took the
child to the railway station, and left with
him on ihp 4:40 train for Ba n Francisco,
where Mr. Da?gett's mother is residing.
Mr. Digget: secured the services of At
â  tqmey Gould to repre-ent him in the pro
ceedings held before Judge Smith. The
attorney had prepared an answer to the
"petition asking for the writ, in which it
â was recitcl that. Mr. JJasrgett had been
called to San Francisco on urgent busi-
Vjess, and that he took the child with him,
. intending to return him. It is also state*
tfjat the child had been returned "in good
condition.''
JniUge Smith wonld not accept this as an
excuse and repriiunnded the father of the
boy severely for iaking him out of the
con'nty witnout the consent of the mother.
,The boy wÂ«s turned over to her by the
court, but the dispute over the child is not
ended. Mr. Gould announced that he
would file a petition for a change of the
custody of the little fellow.

ELOPED FROM JAMESON.
Mysterious Disappearance of Miss Hen-
rietta Jose From ihe Carlisle
Ranch Explained.
FRESNO, Cal., Dec 15.â The mystery
surrounding the disappearance of Hen
rietta Jose, the domestic employed at the
ranch of George Carlisle, near Jameson on
the west side, was unraveled in part to
day, and instead of lying at the bottom of
a slouch, according to the accepted theory,
it was learned that the young lady had
eloped with Joseph Nestel, the laborer
whose love she had appeared to scorn,
and upon whom disagreeable suspicion
was being cast by the authorities after the
girl's disappearance.
It was ascertained during the day that
Nestel and Miss Jose had left the Carlisle
ranch together on Saturday night. On
Sunday they arrived at the house of bis
brotber-iu-law, Joe Miller, at Elkhorn
station, twenty miles directly south of
ihis city. They spent Sunday night there
and on Monday morning left, saying that
they were going either to Fresno or Han
ford to get married. Since then nothing
has been heard of them.
They have as yet procured no mar
riage license in the Clerks office of this
county, and inquir> by telephone froni
Hanford elicited tne fact that the required
document had not been procured there.
It may be possible that they have crossed
the mountains into San Benito County.
A stranee feature of the elopement is
that the young lady departed in ncr work
ing clothes, while it would be presumed
that she would don her best when on matri
mony bent. Her father was opposed to her
match \viih Nestel, and she gave every
outward appearance of being of a similar
mind. She' seemed to treat the laborer's
attentions with the greatest coldness. All
ti;i< time she received attention from a
young man of Berenda named Fred
Weare. It now devemps that she did this
simpiy to please hÂ«r father, but kept secret
company with Nes*el.
DEATH ENDS HER TRIALS.
Passing of a Fresno Bride of Two
Months, Whose Husband Was a
Fugitive.
FRESNO, Cal.. Dec. 15.-Mrs. F. C.
Sajjendorf. aged 19 and a bride of only
two months, died lnat night of typhoid
fever at the home of her mother in this
city. When she breathed her last her
husband was a fugitive from justice in the
southern part of the S:ate. He had been
located in Riverside, but Deputy Consta
ble Crutcher, who held the warrant, fore
bore to have him arrested while Mrs, Sa
gendorf was in a serious condition. To
day he was apprehended.
The circumstances surrounding the
death of ;he young wife are very sad. Sa
gendorf was a boxmaker at one of Ihe
raisin-pacsing houses last summer, when
be and bis wile first met. He bewail pay
ing her attentions and represented that
he had wealthy parents in New YorK and
would fail heir to about J6J.000. He even
went so far as to have letters written to
him, purporting to come from bis wealthy
father, statin? that he (the father) would
give his son financial assistance upon his
marriage.
Shoniy after the wedding Sagendorf be
gan drinking hard. He stole -ome cloth
ins from friend*, robbed a drunken miner
of gold nuggets, and embezz ed a watch
whicn he had borrowed from a friend.
Then he levanted and his whereabouts
were unknov.n for a few weeks. Mrs. Sa
gendorf has resided in this city for a num
ber of years with her mother and was in
estimable lady.

SALT LAKE, Utah, Dec. 15 âPatrick
Coughlin was executed in Rich County,
this State, tnis morning, lor the murder of
Deputy Sheriff Dawes and Constable

when brought to bay fired upon their
pursuers, escaping further into the moun

lioth were tried on the capital charge and
I'oiigblin was sentenced to be shot and
George to a life term in the penitentiary.

fixed there for the coast. Ho had seen the
Carolena lying on the beach at Unalaska
in 1883 and considered her model as very
old fashioned. In good condition, taking
into consideration that she was built in
1861, he believed her value would be 50
per cent lower than a modern vessel of the
same class.

MANY START ON
DUNHAM'S TRAIL
Rurales and Cowboys Join
the Search for the
Fugitive.
Ex-Marshal Gard and Party Are
Going Toward Co:opah
Mountains.
Received Their Information From a
Man Well Acquainted With
the Outlaw.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Dec. 15.â There is
great excitement all along the Mexican
line. Every rurale, cowman and rancher
is on the alert, and every American
Deputy Sheriff, Customs Inspector and
prospector is keeping his eye on approach
ing strangers. The news that a posse is
out t-earchiug for Dunham has reached
every nook and corner of the border, and
it is the sole topic of conversation at Tia
Juana, Cueros de Venado, Niji Tecate,
Siempreviva, Potrero, Campo, Cauyada
Verde and every other little hamlet along
the line as far as the desert.
The source of Sheriff Lyndon's informa
tion was learned to-day. It was Constable
W. A. Clark of San Diego who gave him
points that led to the organization of the
pursuing party. Clark lormerly lived in
Santa Clara County and knew Dunham,
his brothers and the victims of the mur
derer. Ever since the tragedy Clark has
been keeping track of the case as best he
could. He followed tip afier tip, running
them to the ground, until two months
ago he learned something which he
believes will lead to Dunham's capture or
death. Just what this information is he
will not divulge, saying that he is bound
by a promise not to say anything about it.
Clark has made several trips into the
back country, especially to Dulzura, where
Dunham's bee ranch is located. What
he learn- d on these journeys he kept to
himself; but it is learned that he returned
from his last trip last Friday, and that the
next morning Sheriff Lyndon left San
Jose post haste for San Diego. Clark is
pretty wiry, but along rather too far in
years to go on a chase, and it was for this
reason, probably, that he is not with the
: party.
Clark says the posse is headed for the I
Cocopah Mountains. These mountains i
are on tho desert below the line, about
seventy-five miles east of San Diego. It
is reported thac two residents < of Campo â
.cattlemen who have been in more than
one tough scrape on the border â have j
taken the trail and will overtake the posse, j
if possible, and aid it in effecting Dun
ham's capture.
At Tia Juana there waÂ« great excitement
to-day among the Mexican officials. They I
said, after learning what Marshal Gard i
had remarked concerning his telegrams to
the City of Mexico: "That's all very fine.
He can send all the telegrams he wants to, I
but if he and bis posae have entered Mcx- J
ican territory without permission there
will be trouble, and the City ,' of Mexico
will be the first to lesent the impertinence.
If a band of Mexican officers rode rough
shod into the United States there would
be a howl that would be hear.l<all over the
country. But these fellows think it is dif
ferent with the boot on the other leg. : Let
them look out.
Th is is practically the language attrib
uted to the chief â¢ of rurales at Tia Juana,
as well as the other officers there. Whether
there will be any attempt to head off the
American posse is another question, and
there is littre belief hero that anything
will be done by the Mexicans to interfere.
They are supposed to be glad to get rid of
such characters ps Dunham.

CROWN LANDS FOR SETTLERS.
Tracts Claimsd by Ex-Queen Liliuokalam
Opened to Native Hawaiian
Homesteaders.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Dec. 15.â The Ha
waiian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Henry
E. Cooper, arrived here to-night. lie
comes direct from Washington and will
sail for Honolulu on the steamship China
on December 19. He is interested in San
Diego real estate, having formerly resided
here.
"What is Queen Llliuokalani's mission
to the United States?" Mr. Cooper was
asked.
"I don't know," responded Mr. Cooper.
"She came as a private person and there
is no importance to be attached to her
visit that I can see."
"It is reported that she comes to urge
the annexation of the islands to the
United States, in order to make a claim
afterward lor her crown lands, which she
alleges were stolen from her by the re
public."
'â¢Well, I don't know what she is here
for, I am sure," said Mr. Cooper. "She
was pardoned the day before I left Hono
lulu to come to the United States. She
was a bothersome question. It was hard
for us to decide exactly what to do. But
the pardon was issued, and from that
time any relations between her and the
Government, of whatever nature, ceased
to exist. She has nothing to do with our
pol.tics or external relations. She is to
us plain Mr?. Dominis. The crown lands
are now considered Government lands,
and with justice. They are subject to
homesteading by native Hnwaiiuns, on
terms whereby they cannot be sold,
mortgaged or otherwise be disposed of.
This ia working a blessing to the Ha
waiians, and the last census s>hows that
where in former years there was a failing
off of 40 per cent in ten years there is now
an increasing population of natives. This
effectually refutes the assertions that ihe
republicans desired to compass the exter
mination of the natives."
BELASCO HOLDS THE FORT.
Partnership at the Alcazar Changed,
Mr. Jordan Going Out Yesterday.
There was a break-up yesterday of part
nership relations heretofore existing in
the management of the Alcazar Theater.
How this came about or how long trouble
had been Drewing no one in authority or
position to know who could be found at
the thea:er last night was inclined to say.
The break came yesterday afternoon, l ;:e
partner to go out was Mr. Jordan, who
has been acting as treasurer.
The other partnersâ Mr. Be:asco and
Mr. La Faille â held the fort last evening.
Mr. Jordan wa- around the theater onl\* a
short time. The announcement that Mr.
Jordan was out of the partnership was
made by Mr. Belasco. "'Mr. La FaiLe and
myself will continue in the partnership, "
he said. ''Trouble? No, there was no
trouble that caused Mr. Jordan to go out.
I cannot help the stories. We just agreed
to separate, ana that is all there is to it.
That is all thai I will say."
Mr. Jordan was not to be seen late last
night.

A STUDY IN DEPRAVITY.
When young Mr. Hearst adopted journalism as his profession and entered it as
the owner and editor of the San Francisco Examiner ne had an opportunity to
achieve greatness and honor and good repute which few men in the history of time
have had the fortune to possess. He was the son of a United States Senator wno, in
addition to his political prominence and prestige, happened to be a millionaire. He
was a graduate of Harvard, the oldest and most famous of American colleges. He had
been reared in California, where the contrasted consequences of engaging in accent
and in uisreputable joarnalism had found former example. He was made by gift
the owner of the Examiner, an already established newspaper, which if it had no
particular character had yet acquired no large degree of evil repute. He was not put
to the necessity of earning an income dishonestly by yielding to the temptations oi
the impecunious editor or by engaging in the publication of anything which would
tend to debauch and degrade the public mind. On the contrary, every inducement
of decency, honor, ambition, pride and fame was present to urge the publication of a
newspaper which should be a model to the journalists of the world, and which should
exemplify in its daily issues those lofty ideals of which the high-minded editors of
every country have dreamed and attempted to realize.
What has Mr. Hearst done with his opportunity? How has he exemplified the
ideals of his chosen profession upon the pages of the Examiner since he became its
editor? What evidence has he supplied of a noble desire and effort to elevate and
dignify the press of his age and country? What worthy and successful struggle
has be engaged in to purge of its shams, impurities and follies the journalism
of to-day? That he has hired brilliant writers and skillful artists no one will
deny, and that he has expended a respectable fortune in the conduct of the Examiner
upon its chosen lines is also too well known to admit of contradiction. What has
Mr. Hearst succeeded in gaining by the aid of this aggregation of talent and with this
lavish outlay of money ? Honor? No. Reputation? No. Dignity? No. The good
opinion of men ? No. The respect of the profession? No. What, then? Nothing
but the deserved notoriety of being the publisher of the nastiest newspaper on eartn.
The case of young Mr. Hearst furnishes an interesting study in depravity to those
who take pleasure in the investigation of abnormal mental and moral conditions.
The problem which presents itself is this: Was the descent of Mr. Hearst to hitherto
unsounded depths of journalistic depravity aue to a sinister strain in his nature,
which led him irresistibly to attempt to mirror the vileness of his mind on the slimy
surface of his newspaper? Is he by some recurring atavism wreaking upon society
the ancestral taint ? Is he the victim of heredity? Has the youne man turned his
face away from every inducement to an honorable career because his natural tenden
cies toward evil have unfortunately been given rein by his father's gift of the Examiner?
Can Mr. Hearst be decent if he tries?
This is one phase of the psychological problem, but it is not the one which either
charity or pity would impel the close observer of Mr. Hearst's experience to aaopt.
The more reasonable theory and explanation of the young man's indulgence in de
praved journalism seems to be that, like many another youth who has begun active
life with large opportunities and plunged at once into the midst of a profession, he is
the victim of association with that class of bright but unprincipled men who so often
seize upon adolescence, when supplied with a goodly share of wealth, as their natural
and proper prey, and who, finding young Mr. Hearst bent upon becoming a journalist,
fastened themselves upon his fatness, where they have since remained.
The most conspicuous example of Mr. Hearst's misfortune in the selection of
assistants and a 'visers is the present managing editor of his newspaper, who is now
widely and familiarly known as "Long Green" Lawrence. It is he who must be
given the largest share of discredit for having dragged Mr. Hearst's newspaper into
the shoals and sloughs of sensational journalism. It is to him that the brilliant
writers and artists who have drifted into and out of the Examiner office owe little
thanks for having compell- d their talents to the basest uses to which ability can be
degraded. It is to "Long Green" Lawrence that Mr. Hearst should credit the repu
taiiou which his editorial rooms have acquired as the nesting place of journalistic
scavengers and scandal-mongers, and the dumping ground of that kind of social
carrion which finds its natural place of deposit upon the desks of a depraved
newspaper.
If this latter solution of Mr. Hearst's descent into the depths of indecent jour
nalism is the correct one it would seem to be an office of genuine mercy for some
true friend of himself or his family to warn him of his danger before it is too late. Mr.
Hearst is still young, and, it is currently believed, is not giving sufficient personal atten
tion to the details and doings of his local newspaper to apprise himself fully of the
depth of disrepute into which it has fallen and of the immeasurable injury not only
to his adopted profession, but to his own personal reputation, which is being done
by tne "Long Green' 1 manager who is iv local charge of his affairs.
THE COMMITTEE OF FIFTY.
The Committee of Fifty which has in
charge in this City the fight against the
funding bill has prepared to take an active
part in the contest at Washington this
winter. It will send representatives to the
National capital to act for the people of
San Francisco and California and to give
every aid possible to our delegation in
Congress in their struggle to defeat the
iniquity.
The meeting of the committee on Mon
day was well attended and was a most bar
monious one in every respect. It dis
closed tne fact that the members of the
committee are as resolute as ever in their
opposition to the measure and propose to
make their influence felt in the strugele
for the welfare of the State against the
greedy schemes of the monopoly. The
report from Washington that the fund
ing-bill lobby is sanguine of success has
evidently produced no discouragement in
the minds of the committee. They be
lieve they can win and will fight aggres
sively to that end.
The sub-committee appointed to wait
upo.n Senator White to discuss plans for
making the fight for the people and em
powered to select representatives to go to
Washington to take part in the contest
was well selected. It consists of Mayor
elect Phelan, J. H. Barry and George K.
Fitcb. These men can be relied upon to
be vigilant, earnest and faithful in the
work intrusted to them, and good results
may be counted on from their efforts.
It must be borne in mind that the Com
mittee of Fifty cannot fight this battle
alone, nor should it be expected to do so.
The members represent the people in a
hard struggle for popular interests against
a great and powerful monopoly, and
should have the cordial support and co
operation of the citizens generally. The
business men of San Francisco are as
much concerned in the outcome of the
contest against the funding bill as are the
farmers of the interior of the State, ar.d
onght to contribute liberally to the funds
necessary to maintain a representative of
the City at Washington so long as the
measure is before Congress.
As was said at the meeting of the com
mittee by Mayor Sutro, it is evident that
Huntington and his supporters intend to
make a desperate fight to pass the nefari
ous measure at this session of Congress,
and it behooves the people of California
to present a statement of the matter tbat
will block his schemes and put an end to
the outrageous measure forever. Now is
the time to fight, and we must present
such a front and show such unity of pur
pose and resolution as will give encour
agement to all the opponents of the meas
ure imd rouse them to a determination to
defeat the bill in whatever shape it comes.
PRESNO'S RESOURCES.
The address of weicome delivered by
Judge Carter at the opening of th â¢ citrus
fair in Fresno gave a glowing statement of
the resources of the great valley of the
San Joaquin and of Fresno County in par
ticular. This portion of the address was
short, but is sufficiently noteworthy to
deserve the full attention, not only of Cal
ifornians, but of the Union generally.
According to Judge Carter Fresno
County is in itself an epitome of all Cali
fornia. Few, if any, of the boundless
resources of the State, he said, are lacking
in that valley, or even in that county. He
then proceeded to enumerate the giant
fores>t3 of sequoia, redwood, spruce and su
gar pine, the herds of cattle, droves of
horses, flocks of sheep, the petroleum
products, the natural gas and asphaltum
beds, the deposits of chalk and of lime
stone, of gypsum and asbestos and coal,
the soil capable of yielding grains of all
kinds, vines, fruits, berries and sugar
bwtk
The rounded periods in which the orator
summed up this superb showing of the
resources of the San Joaquin were not
more eloquent than truthful. That great
valley contains within itself a wealth of
natural resources sufficient for a great
kingdom. There is scarcely any form of
fruit or flower, or any plant, useful, medi
cinal or beautiful, which cannot b6 pro
duced in a high state of excellence within
the valley or on the slopes of its hills and
mountains. Every form of industry,
therefore, can be carried on within its
limits, and every talent of its people can
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 16, 1896
find full employment and development in
the work best suited to it.
In any other section of the world a dis
trict so rich as this would be unique. It
would have no neighboring rival. It
would stand alone anu be renowned and
famous throughout all the country around
it. In California, however, this is not so.
Rich as are fhe resources of Fresno, so
well portrayed by her eloquent advocate,
they are not superior to those of several
other counties of the State. There are
many valleys in California that can with
good reasons claim to contain each within
itself an epitome of the resources of the
State. In nearly all portions of this
glorious commonwealth of ours there is a
capability of the most widely varied and
diversified industry known to man. Each
of our greater counties can safely invite
enterprising immigrants with thÂ« full as
surance tnat whatever may be their
tastes, talents or capabilities it can find
within its borders ful! employment for the
best energies of every man who comes
to it.
THE CUBAN LEAGUE.
The organization of the Cuban League
of the United States by a number of men
of well-known ability and influence will
be received with no little gratification by
the people generally. It is everywhere
recognized that the time has come for the
United States to take some determined
action in putting an end to the prolonged
war in the island, and since the Senate
seems incapable of doing anything more
than make speecnes it is well that indi
vidual citizens should take the subject in
charge and propose some plan for the so
lution of the problem.
Among those who are prominent in the
league are many to whom the people can
reasonably look for earnest action. Among
t:iese may be cited Theodore Roosevelt,
General Butterbeld, Colonel Fred Grant,
Colonel Ethan Allen, Chauncey M. Depew,
lioswell P. Flower, Powell Clayton, War
ner Miller, Charles A. Dana and John
Jacob Astor. These men are certainly
capable of devising some plan for putting
an end to the war, and as they represent
all parties and are men of more than ordi
nary influence, it seems fair to presume
that whatever plan they devise can be car
ried out.
The league proposes to hold a great
mass-meeting at the Cooper Union in New
York on Monday night, and some of the
leading statesmen in the country, includ
ing Speaker Reed, Senator Cullom, Sena
tor Morgan of the Committee on Foreign
Relations in the Senate, and Congressman
Hitt of that same committee in the House,
are expected to speak. This meeting will
be awaited with no little expectation. It
may possibly turn out to be no more than
an occasion for expressing sympathy, but
the prospects are that the resolutions
adopted there will formulate some plan
which Congress may adopt and the admin
istration put into lorce.
Popular expectation of good results to
follow irom the organization of the league
is based wholly upon the character of the
men who compose it. The men who have
accepted offices in the league and made
themselves r sponsible for its direction
are certainly well aware of all the diffi
culties involved in the problem. It is
hardly conceivable that men of their posi
tion and repute In the country would ac
cept such responsibility unless they had
fiisi welt considered now they could carry
it with honor to themselves and accom
plish with success the duties which it im
poses.
The resolutions which set forth the ob
jects of the league give no intimation of
what plans of actions are to be proposed.
They go no further than to assert that the
organizers regard the continuance of the
struggle in Cuba as calculated to prolong
a sense of abasement and humiliation in
the minds of all who are confident that
this Republic has the power to end it. It
would seem, therefore, that these gentle
men have tbat confidence, and the coun
try now awaits to hear what they propose
to do and by what means they expect to
put an end to the war and establish the
independence of the island.
In its last edition the Park News, which
circulates in Golden Gate Park every
Sunday, says: "Believing that lottery
schemes of any kind aro against the best
interests of the people, and worked for the
benefit of the few by fraudulent means,
the Park News will in the future accept no
such advertisements in its columns at any
price." This gives us another strong ally
in the koocl cause, but there is room for
more. Every paper In San Francisco
should join the movement, for all of them
Know that lottery advertising is not only
unlawful but is an enticement of swindlers
and wholly fraudulent.

SOMETHING OF \ CHANGE.
Philadelphia Bulletin.
Certainly there is a transformation that must
bo stupefying to the grave diplomatists of the
Old World between the tone of the Tory
press now and a year ago, when we were re
minded daily what a trilling task it wou'd be
for Britain to blockade our ports, blow our sea
board cities Into fragments and, if need be,
repeat the lesson General Ross gave Madison
In 1812 by burning down Washington over the
insolent heads of the Congress that dared send
tho Venezuelan affront to the British people.
Yet it will be remarked that we have not,
diplomatically or otherwise, done a single act
toward repeutance. We have not, so far us
official records show, modified one jot or tittle

FOR THE SAKE OF THE CHILDREN.
6an Francisco News Letter.
California is at present being treated to the degrading spectacle of a mil
lionaire groveling in the dirt for the nickels of the unwashed and tne unedu
cated mob. We refer to Mr. Hearst and his method oi conducting the
Examiner. The tricks resorted to by this most servile of newspapers have
time and a S ain been laid bare to the public, the better part of which has long
since treated it with the contempt it merits. The mob, however, whose
hardened palates crave for offensive dishes in cne form or another, ana to
whom blackguardism is wit and vulgarity a form of amusement, look up tow
for the R arbled mess of slander, obscenity, falsehood and criminal statistics
apoearing in its columns as news. Rebuke h*B followed rebuke, administered
by "the respectable press of this City and of the State, but to little purpose.
Aware of It* own shame, and preferring braggadocio to honest repentance, t&e
paper is rapidly going from bad to worse and is now the most virulent cancer
existing in our midst.
San Francisco bears the reputation elsewhere of bÂ«ing a vicious city, where
vice exists unhindered and where moral corruption is bred in every class of so
ciety. For this we have to thank the Examinerâ the journalistic harlot of Mis
sion street. The smallest crimes committed in this City are given precedence
in its columns over the numerous acts of goodness and of charity perpetrated
daily by our citizens. The views of criminals on unimportant topics are given
more notice than the sayings of our worthy divines. T<U9 not only strikes the
eye of the visitor from other lands, but it inculcates in the children of our
laborersâ who are the chief patrons of the paperâ a desire to be vicious them
selves, and thus acquire notoriety by walking in the path of vice.
It is for this reason that we call on all respectable and God-fearing citizens
to help U3 stamp this evil out before it attains further powr. The children
are the makers of the country, and they must be protected from influences
that will prove hurtful to them. By allowing their minds to be polluted by
dwelling on the degrading literature and obscene cartoons favored by the Ex
aminer we endanger not only their own future but that of our own fair State.
ComrjÂ»on-sense bids us call the halt; combined action will enable us to do so.
HYPOCRITICAL AND FALSE.
Pasadena Star.
The Examiner has teen falking recklessly about papers taking subsidy
from the Southern Pacific Company, and in some cases being supported
wholly by it The Alameda Argus pertinently calls attention to the fact that
no paper in the State has been so grossly subsidized by the same influence as
the Examiner itself, and that its warfare against it did not begin until tbat
subsidy stopped. The Examiner's pretense in this matter is wholly hypocriti
cal and false md its crocodile tears relate to the loss of the s3o,ooo contract and
not to any prickings of conscience.
AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
Miss Anna V. Bing, who has spent five years
as a missionary In Japan, Is at the Occidental.
Her home is at Delaware, Ohio, and she is re
turning to her mission work after a protracted
vacation.
The lady is a missionary of the Methodist
Episcopal church, and her particular lab<>r is
to teach the young Japanese girls music, in
MISS ANNA V, BING, Who Is
Teaching Our Music to Japan
ese Maidens.
[Sketched from life by a "Call" artist.]
the gh-ls' school, which is running at Naga
saki.
"The music oi the Japanese is so different
from ours," said Miss Bing yesterday, "that
for a time it was a question whether the girls
could ever sing or play as we da
"The Japanese have no musical notes, and
their native instruments are so strange when
compared with those of Europe and America
that it seemed impossible that they would
make any progress in our music. I had a hard
task of it. One very peculiar thing to me was
that there was no book written about music,
no history of the progress of music, in the
empire. No such a work had ever been
written.
"But while the Japanese wore not musical at
all, from our standpoint. I nevertheless found
that the girls learned rapidly. Since the
Japanese have no notes, their music is given
by ear. Their largest instrument is rhe koto.
It is as long as a sofa, and has thirteen strings
on it. Each string has a bridge of its own.
And sometimes the player stops and changes
the tune in the middle of his music.
"The geiken is another queer Japanese
stringed instrument, It is next in size to the
koto, is double stringed and almost round,
like a mandolin. It is played the same way,
too. with a little pick.
"The samisen is a three-stringed instrument,
with a very long neck. Its neck is almost four
feet long, and it is played with a very broad
pick. Then there is a one-stringed instru
mont, with a very small dox. All these
stringed instruments are very peculiar, and
each has peculiarities of its own. For instance,
the big instrument, the koto, is played with
two fingers. The Japanese never think of
using all the fingers.
"The girls at Nagasaki thought it so strange
that we should use all five fingers in playing.
Notwithstanding the use of the native instru
ments, to which the people are accustomed,
they are taking rapidly to the piano, violin,
guitar and others of our instruments, and are
also learning to sing our best religious and
other songs. I think the time will come when
they will adopt our music hs a system. "
Miss Bine will sail on the Doric to resume
her teaching of the Japanese maidens.

British Masters Say They
Prefer a "Disinterested
Referee/
Cedar Logs Are Scarce in All
Central American
Ports.
The Schooner Martha W. Tuft Came
Back From Sin Bias With
Ha f a Load.
The British ship captains whose vessels
are now lying at Sausalito have got un a
reeatta for next Saturday. Nearly every
vessel in the bay flying the British flap
has entered a boat and some good con
tests ara expected.
One paragraph in the notice issued by
the captains reads as follows: "A disin
terested adjudicator (not Wyatt Earp),
whose decision shall oe final, will be on
the .flagship Glenesslin." The races are
to start at 3 p m. sharp and entries are to
be made at A. McÃoyle & Co.'s on Wash
ington street near transonic.
The schooner Martha W. Tuft, which
arrived here from San Bias a couple of
days ago, had a bad time of it during the
voyage. When she arrived at her destina
tion and discharged her cargo there was
no return load ready. The vesse! was to
brinj up cedar logs, but all that could be
secured was 179, so the Tuft i as returned
with only half a load. It is getting harder
and harder to secure cedar in Central
American ports, and captains of coasting
vessels will think twice before they go
there to load.
Captain Spear had an experience with
one of his men five days hefore the
schooner reached port. A~ sailor named
Murcha went violently insane, ana it took
nearly the entire crew to put him in irons.
Yesterday he was sent to the Rfceiving
Hospital to be examined as to his sanity.
The Tuft will discharge at Spear-street
wharf and then may luy up for the win
ter. The accompanying sketch shows the
schooner coming in over the bar last Sun
day.
The Harbor Commissioners did not meet
yesterday because of the weather and be
cause Commissioner Cole was unwell.
Captain Leale, tbe popular master of

The steam schooner Jeanie lost an
anchor and fifteen fathom of chain in
Monday's storm. The vessel has been
chartered to load combustibles for Alaska
and came out of Oakland Creek during
the afternoon. Captain Mason attempted
to anchor bis vessel between Alcatraz and

best bower had to be dropped in order to
hold the steamer.
Captain Atwood, late of the schooner
Puritan, has been appointed chief officer

The new steam schooner Alliance had
her trial trip on the bay yesterday and
gave universal satisfaction. She is owned
by Gray & Mitchell and was built in Oak
lana. Her engines and toilers were
made by the Oakland Iron Works, and |
they are the first marine machinery ever |
built and put in a vessel in Oakland.
Among tho*e who went out on the trial j
trip were Geor.e K. Fritch, Captain Cook, I
George Boole, C. H. Higgins, J. J. Loggie,
Mrs. A. M. Abbott, H. D. Bendisieu, John
Mitchell, B. M. Madison, Captain Han
son, Captain S. Biair, George D. Gray,
Robert Dollar, Captain Anderson, W. W.
Taylor and a number of others. The
Alliance was run np to Hunters Point
and then to Raccoon Straits, where lunch j
was served. Then tbe vessel was headed j
for the Golden Gate, and an hour later she I
was given a spin over the measured mile. |
She will be put in the lumber and passen- j
ger trade.
The office of J. S. Kimball, on Mission
street wharf, was broken open last Mon
day night, but the robbers secured no
plunder. Luckily all the packages an i
everything oi value had been taken out
on Monday afternoon. Shortly after dis
covering that 'he office had been broken \
into Mr. Kimball received a telegram |
stating that his gasoline schooner Bessie
X was ashore 250 feet south of the south
jetty at the mouth of the Coquilie River.
The vessel was running short of gasoline
and the captain was anxious io make
port. Tne schooner is hard ana fast on
the spit, but Mr. Kimball thinks she will
get off. The crew has ieft her, but are
ready at a moment's notice to make the
attempt to get her off. A tug wiiJ be sent
to her assistance.
The schooner Charles R. Wilson from
Gray's Harbor for San Francisco was

The wind is very lie it outside now and
she may be yet several days in making

GOVERNOR SADLER SUED.
Robert Zei'e Se ks to Secur Judgment
fur 86000, Mon.-y Loaned.
Governor Sadler of the State of Nevada
was made defendant in a suit instituted
yesterday in tbe buperior Court of this
State. The plaint. ff is Robert Zeile, a re
tired merchant residing in this City, who
sues to recover $0000 on a promissory note.
Long before Nevada's present chief ex
ecutive was in politics he was a merchant
in the town of Eureka, Nev., when that
town enjoyed considerable more prosper
ity than at the present time. So well diJ
K. Sadler, merchant, stand in the commer
cial world t at h found little difficulty in
securing a cash loan from Robert Zeile in
the sum of $6000. This was many years
ago, aud a written promise to pay passed
into the hanas of Zeile in exchange ior 300
$20 pieces, and up to date this is all ti. at
lie has to show for his trust and confidence
in tbe financial ability of Nevada's iormer
Governor.
The original note was renewed in 1891,
and as the Governor has not been in the
State of California very often of late an
opportunity had to re awaited in order to
serve hirr with the proper papers. A few
dÂ».ys ago Governor Badler came to San
FranciiCJ and immediately Reinstein &
Eisner, attorneys foi Zeile, prepared the
necessary papers and tiled them with the
County ClerK. When it came to serving
notice on the defendant, however, it was
found that he had left for home.
The reason for Bringing the suit at this
time is to secure judgment, in order that
the claim may not be outlawed.

Funeral of the Late Mrs.
Annie Donahue From the
Home of Mourning.
The Very Impressive Service
in St. Mary's Cathedral
Witnessed by Many.
Interment of tbe Late R. M Baatty,
Who Was Attorney-General of
Nevadaâ Pythiaa Serv.ce.
The residence, 2112 Pacific avenue,
where on last Saturday Mrs. Annie Dona
hue passed into eternal rest, was crowded
yesterday with friends of the deceased
lady eager to convey their sympathy to
the mourning relatives. The beautiful
casket containing the mortal remains of
Mrs. Donahue was surrounded with ele
gent floral pieces, mute but eloquent ex
pressions of respect Jor the one who in life
had endeared herself to them.
The casket was placed in a hearse and
conveyed to St. Mary's Cathedral, where
a solemn requiem high mass was cele
brated. ThÂ«Â» vast edifice was crowded far
beyond the seating capacity shortly after
the doors had been opened. The great
altar was covered with somber drapery,
and near the chancel-rail were bouquets of
flowers, pink and royal purple being the
dominant colors, which rested in a setting
of palms and foliage.
As the funeral cortege, preceded by the
honorary paii-bearers, Judge William T.
Wallace, Judge William W. Morrow, John
M. Burnett, Mayor-elect James D. PhÂ«lan,
living M. Scott, Claus Sprcckels, General
P. W. Murphy, R. E. Doyle, Judge Joseph
D. McKenna, Oliver P. Evans. A. H.
Loughborough and Joseph B. Crockett,
ascended the broad flight of stairs leading
to the sacred edifice there was an organ
voluntary by RJ. Harrison. The casket,
covered with violets and a spray of pink
blossoms, was loliowed to the ber in
front of the altar by Mrs. Eleanor Martin,
sister of the deceased and chiet mourner,
and members of her family and relatives
of the late Peter Donahue.
The mass was celebrated by the very
reverend Pendergast, vicar general, as
sisted by Father Rain, deacon. Rev.
Father Dempsey, subueacon, and Rev.
Father .Byrne, master of ceremonies.
Archbishop Riordan was present, as were
also eight priests and eighteen altar boys.
The impressive mass was most effective,
and during the service Donald e'e V. Gra
ham sang with a ereat deal of feeling the
air Maria, and Louis Heine played a
solemn prelude on the 'ceilo.
The funeral sermon and eulogy was by
the t-eiebrant, who said:
la days past when kings were omnipotent,
one of them asked a dying courtier what favor
he most desired as a final test of royal grati
tude?
The King was willing to bestow anything,
any title or rank. All the courtier desired was
a little longer lease of life. Thus it is, my
friends, when the last hour comes, science
stands aside, knowledge has to assume the
role of ignorance, und tender love can only
weep. \Y u en a cuau looks out upon the un
known into the beyond, a ray of pity comes
to us.
Faith is a gift of God. Faith and hope and
charity were the heritage oi our departed
friend, Mrs. Donahue, to the last. Hope,
which lifts us up to God; charity, which is
love, which binds us to God, were hers.
Faithâ you all know how strong her faith was.
.-lie was a woman of culture, but no specula
tions could shake her f altn. Her faith as a
Catholic rested on three ioundatioiis â Jesus
Christ, the Father and the Holy Spirit. The
human race will always cling to Us ideal
standard, will always distinguish between
right and wrong, will always assert the moral
principle oi the rinht to believe.
Humanity is sometimes very low, but it is
sometimes very high. The faith of Mrs.
Donahue was an intelligent laith. She dis
tinguished between the essentials of faith and
the accidents. She did not pay overmuch at
tention to some of the devotions ot the church,
but she fulfilled the great moral lawa and
obligations of her religion. She was most
conscientious in attending to these obiiga
uniib of her faith.
Her faith was a practical, living faith, going
forth in deeds of chaiity. Mtb. Donahue has
passed away, laith, hope and charity leading
her on and uniting her to the Kterual Father.
1 think that you will be convinced that the
belief in the prayers of the bertaved for their
departed friends rests on an intelligent basis.
The belief in a future state rests on the f act
that we are all imperfect and carry our imper
fections to the lust. It seems only reasonable
that ihose who strive to be free noin sin here
may have another place in which to perfect
themselves.
And vow, my dear friends, what consolation
does their faith tiresent to these mourners to
day? It tells them first of all that this separa
tion is not forever. "I am tne resurrection
and the life." These words wou.d never have
been uttered if they had not been true. And
again, this separation is not an absolute sepa
ration. There is a relation between the living
and the dead. It has always been believed
that the departed can pray for s, and that
our prayers for them will be heard.
And so we say farewell to our departed
friend, whom we all esteemed for her many
fine qualities.
During the eulogy many of the vast
congregation were affected" to tears. At
the close of the service the casket was
borne to the hearse again, Beethoven's
funeral march being rendered as the post
hide.
THE LATE R. M. BEATTY.

BIOYOLES AT AUCTION.
A IÂ»ong lilne of Hlgh-GradÂ« Wheelg to.
Be Sold To-Day.
It is seldom that a lot of high-grade
bicycles find their way into an auction
room to be sold without reserve or limit
to the highest bidders. This, however,
will be the case to-day. Davis, Haber
& Co., the auctioneers, of 211 Pine
street, will stll by order of George
Webb Alexander a number of Yost-
Falcon and Warner wheels, tbe sa. ; e
commencing this morning at 11 o'clock.
The bicycles in question will comprise a
line of i 896 models, which will include
tandems and juvenile wheels. The hi;:h
character of the Yost - Falcon, aa
well as the Warnet wheels, is too well
known to require commendation. Mr.
Alexander, .he auent, is anxious to make
room for his 1897 stock, and has therefore
inaugurated a public sale as the quickest
way to dispose of th a year's wheels. A
broad and liberal guarantee will go with
each bicycle. â¢

SIXTEENTH STREET
FULL OF VIGOR
Its Improvement Club Has
Taken Hold in Good
Earnest.
C'aus Spreckels Contributes to
Provide for Its Illumina
tion.
Celebration Will Take Place Satur
day N.ght in Commemoration
of Progress.
Money talked at the meeting of the
Sixteenth-street Improvement Club Mon
day night and the announcement of liberal
subscriptions to the electric-lighting fund
was an eloquence that appealed most
pleasantly to all present. This was only
the second meeting of the club, yet. the
results already achieved are of so encour
aging a nature that the prospects are ex
cellent for every undertaking of this en
ergetic and enterprising body of men be
ing made a complete success.
The immediate purpose of the club is to
secure the electric lighting of Sixteenth
street from Folsom to Guerrero, and of tbe
cross streets between Fi teenth and Seven
teenth.
At the meeting Monday night at 2909 Six
teenth street, over which J. J. Moran pre
sided, the various committees reported a
list of montnly subscriptions from mer
chants and property-owners aggregating
$143 25, sufficient to pay for fifteen big
Btreet lights,
Among the most liberal monthly sub
scriptions of property-owners were the fol
lowing: Ciaus Spreckels $20, John Center
$10, Bruns Broi. $10, W. H. Taylor $5, J. H.
Mangels for C. H. Mangels' estate $5. The
merchants in the block between Folsom
and Howard subscribed $9 75, those be
tween Howard and Mission $21 50 and
those between Mission and Valencia $60.
No subscriptions have yet been reported
from the block between Valencia and
Guerrero, though some are promised. A
number of liberal subscriptions were also
reported from Mission-street merchants.
It was decided to let the contract
for the blocks between Folsom and Valen
cia streets. There will be five lights to a
block with one at the Howard anil one at
the Mission-street crossing. Tnere will
be two lights on Mission street between
Fifteenth and Sixteenth streets and one
between Sixteenth and Seventeenth
streets. There will be a fitting celebration
Saturday night with a band, bonfires on
the crossings, illumination, decorations,
etc.
The following resolutions were adopted:
Rctolved, That the liberality of Claus
Spreckels, John Center, Bruns Bros., Goldman
& Son, F. \V. Waibel and F. H. Taylor has been
such as is characteristic of tne progressive,
large-hearted and liberal-minded citizen, and

NEW MAP OF THE CITY.
Grand Jury Regards It Incomplete,
aud Will Adv se Against Pay
ment of SIO.OOO.
The Supervisors engaged Charles S.
Tilton, City and County Surveyor, to make
a map of the Puebio;of San Francisco. It
was understood when the contract to pay
$10,000 for the worfc was entered into, that
the new map should designate all the
recently platted additions, all the high
ways, by -ways, streets, lanes, alleys, places
and courts within tl:e boundaries of the
metropolis. The main part of the work
on the map has been done by ex-City and
County Surveyor William P. Humphreys
and associate engineers.
The Supervisors, it is said, are willing to
accept the map and pay the price stipu
lated, but Mayor Sutro and bis engineer,
Robert Munch, are reported to be kicking
VKorously against official acceptance.
There are two stories afloat concerning
the mup. and the Grand Jury has heard
both. Yesterday the jury heard Messrs.
Tilton and Humphreys.
Mr. Humphreys admitted that the map
might be made to contain designations
which it did not possess, but that it in
cluded everything which the contract
called for. It was easy enough to add
what had be n omitted, and so correct
the map up to date, but the additional
work would be charged for.
In the course of the inquiry Messrs.
Tilton and Humphreys disclosed the fact
that the City owns several lots to which
no right of ownership has been asserted
because the municipal authorities did not
know that the lots beloneed to the City.
A prominent savings bans holds a lot be
longing to the City. Presumably some ad
verie claimant years ago convinced the
bank managers that his title was. clear
and borrowed money from the bank by
mortgaging the land. The mortgage was
foreclosed and the land passed to the pos
session of the bank. Testimony was
given to the effect that the City has title
to West Mission Plaza lands.
Members of the Grand Jury were con
vinced that if resolute action were tauen
upon the part of the municipal authori
ties much valuable land reserved to the
City for public use could yet ie saved
from the grasp of adverse claimants.
The witnesses failed io convince the jury
that the map was complete, and the up
sliotof the investigation will probably be
a communication to the Board of Super
visors advising against official acceptance
of the map and payment of the money
until certain designations of plats, boule
vards, streets and highways are made.
Some time ago the Grand Jury indicted
J. F. Smith for making a lalse affidavit
concerning the genuineness of signatures
attached to a petition asking the Board of
Election Commissioners to place Calvin B.
Ewing's name on the ticket as a canaidate
for State Senatoi.
Owing to some technicality the indict
ment was set aside in Jud c Wallace's
court. Subsequent investigation has
clearly demonstrated to ihe jury tbe inno
cence of J. F. Smith. The fictitious names
were added to the document by the inser
tion of several pages after he had made
the affidavit. He took but a few signa
tures himself, and properly swore that
they were genuine. He made a statement
to the Granrt Jury yesterday, and that
body at once requested tbe District Attor
ney to move for a dismissal of the indict
ment against him.
The procuring of this petition marked
Mr. Smith's advent into the political
arena. His zeal in assisting a friend
brought him sore trials, and obliged him
to hire lawyers, attend court and give up
much of his valuable time to save himself
lrom serious consequences. He is out of
politics now and promises to stay out.
The incident before the Grand Jury closes
his career as an active politician.
MISSION-STREET WRECK.
An Expressman* Wagon Ran Into by
an Electric- tar aud Badly
Broken.
There was a collision and a great crash
of glass at Twenty -first and Mission
streets shortly after 10 o'clock yesterday
forenoon.
A large covered express- wagon drawn
by a pair of horses was moving aJong
Twenty-tirst street goins west with a
heavy load of window-glass for a building
in the Mission district, and before it
crossed the car track on the eastern side
of Mission street an electric-car, No. 1024,
moving toward the City, bore down upon
it, and despite the efforts of the motor
man to check the speed of his car it struck
the wagon between the forward and hind
wheels and overturned it.
The driver of the wagon, who because
of the cover did not see the approaching
car, Jumped at tlie moment of impact,
reins in t:and and held on to his team,
which had become frightened and strug
gled wildly to get away. Assistance soon
came, the animals "were quieted, un
hitched and led away. The driver of the
team, wLose name is Wilson, escaped un
hurt. The passengers on the car were
only shaken up and frightened.
The off forward wheel of the wagon
was snappe 1 off at the axle, the body
forced off the springs and the load of
glass very badly shattered.
The inoiorma.il declined to make any
statement in regard to the matter. The
debris was removed and traffic resumed.

Delegates to the National

Charles H. Booth of California Elected
President of the Coa
vention.
PHCENIX, Ariz., Dec. 15.â The fifth
National irrigation congress was called to
order at 11 o'clock thi* morning by Na
tional Chairman E. R. Moses of Kansas.
John E. Frost ot Kansas was elected tem
porary chairman, James H. McClintock
of Arizona temporary secretary, A. L.
Kellogg of Colorado and L. S. Howlett of
Washington assistant secretaries.
National Chairman Moses addressed the
congress. He said the year 1896 had been
one of disaster; that the interests of irri
gation had suffered to considerable ex
tent and thut the convening of this con
gress at one time seemed impracticable,
but the committee had worked aisiduous
ly, and a great and representative body
was the result. He be-ieved the work of
previous congresses had been imperfect
and that tbis one must do better. We
might disagree as to politics and religion,
bat the people of arid America must
stand together in the great work of irriga
tion. This congress must agree upon a
bill or bills to be passed by the United
States Congress, and National aid rcust
be the feature. He favored the creation
of an irrigation and forestry committee to
have charge of the matter.
The address of welcome on behalf of the
city was delivered by Mayor J. D. Moni
han of Phoenix. Governor B. J. Franklin
of Arizona, on behalf of the Territory,
Bpoke as follows:
Ladies and gentlemen of the Fifth National
Irrigation Congress: Arizona extends to you
a cordial and grateful welcome. I esteem it a
great honor to have the privilege of grewiug
such a distinguished body assembled from
many of ihe great commonwealths of the
Union for the purpose of discussing one of tho
supreme questions that now interests not only
Arizona, but all the nrid West.
It is certainly appropriate for this congress
to meet on tnis soil, wflere tnousands of years
ago irrigation beean. Professor Powei l, a dis
tinguished authority, in one of hSS reportsfto
the secretary of the Interior says that theiirst
indications of irrigation are to be found ia ihe
Territory of Arizonaâ in this beautiful city
that sitslike a jeweled crowned queen encir
cled in a coronet of flowers in thÂ« garden of
the most magnificent valley on the continent;
that more than 300 years ago ivhen Ccronndo
â was seeking the seven cities of Cibola ;ie dis
covered the Casa Grande ruins. They seemed
to be as much de&iyed then as now, and scien
tific researcnes show that long before Abra
ham fed his flocks on the plains of Judea, and
long Leiore our great Master delivered his ser
mou, long before Buddha preached his philos
ophy, there was a nourishing community in
this great valley.
We had at that time an |immense population
in these valley 6. Hisiory will repeat itself,
the population will again increase, and when
water is apolied to our bountiful lands and
capital comes to our aid, all the valleys of
Arizona will blossom as the rose. Whit is
true of Arizona is true oi all the arid lands of
the West.
You liave ;met, gentlemen of this congress,
for a great purpose. Our convention, which
lasts for only three days,*should last for ten or
fifteen days, for the questions you are to dis
cuss are supreme questsons. We may differ as
to polities, we may differ as to relixioii, we
may differ 01. many oiher things, but nil the
people of the States from Nebraska, Kansas
and the Dakotns to the Pacific Ccavt agree
that we de? ire the reclamation of arid lauds.
[Applause.] That is the Bupreme question
with us.
I believe that the Government shonld give
aid to the reclamation of arid lands. Every I
year the Government passes a river and har- I
bor bill bestowing hundreds of thousands of I
dollars for the improvement of insignificant |
harbors and streams. Navigation is not im
proved by it. Commerce is not aided, and the
money might as well be thrown into the
ocean. Why should not this money be given
to the reclamation of arid lands? Twelve
mites above Florence, al a place known as
The Buttes, there is the grandest reservoir site
on the continent, and for $2, 200,000 500,000
acres of land could be put under cultivation.
I have nothing to do with the questions you
have to discuss, but I ask whether the Govern
ment should not take hold of tnese reservoir
sites and keep them from individual and cor
porate rapacity. [Applause.] Why not re
serve these grand reservoir sites in the inter
ests of the people and then let tbe Govern
ment appropriate money for the purpose of
storing me vater ? This reservoir Mte of the
Gila Valleywhich I have already mentioned
is only oue among many of the grand reser
voirs of the arid W T est.
It seems to me that the arid West has bfen
an orphan at Washington ior a long time.
[Laughter.] It is time it asserted itself and
that we should tell them, "If you give us
nothing we will give you nothing."
I again gladly greet you and welcome you.
It gives me great pleasure to talk to this dis
tinguished body. I cannot detain you to tell
you of all the wonderful beauties of this mag
nificent valley, of our orctmrds, our orange
groves, our great alfalfa fields, our fat cattle
and our sunshine, for you will see all these
things and will say when you return, "We
have heard great tales ot this country, but tbe
half has not been told."
Arizona, when water is supplied, will prove
not only a great mining bui a great agricul
tural State. This valley alone is much larger
than the State of Rhode Island, the Salt Rivr
Valley, the San Pedro and the Gila, with
others, put together, would make a State
larger than any in New England.
1 do not indulge in ttie feeling that this is a
time of great depression. I feel It is a year of
prosperity with us in Arizona. We have in
creased in gold, in copper, in our mining out
put more than a million dollars, and Arizona
in the future will be notonly a sunshine State,
but a golden State, lor her gold product is in
creahiae every year. I am proud of her pros
perity, of her possibilities, and I am glad to
sew to-dat:

Responses were made by John E. Frost
of Kansas, W. F. Burbank of California
and A. G. Wolfenbarger of Nebraska.
A call of States for the appointment of
the credentials committee showed the fol
icwine States and Territories represented:

sas. Minnesota, Montana, Missouri, Michi
enn, Nebraska, Now V rk, Nev.- Mexico,
North Dakota, Nevada, Onio, Oklahoma,
Rhode Island, Texas, Utah. Washington,
Wyoming, Wisconsin. The congress then
adjourned until afternoon.
The only special incident of the fore
noon was tne intimation of Gov
ernor Franklin (D.) that he was glad that
the gold standard had triumphed in the
iate election.
At the afternoon session tbe report of
the committee on credentials was adopted
and permanent organization was effected
by the election of Charles H. Boota of
California president and Governor Frank
H. Brings of North Dakota vice-president.
A committee on reorganization was ap
pointed, consisting of the president and
secretary of the executive committee and
Messrs. Moses of Kansas, Heintz of Cali
fornia, O'Neill of Arizona, Watson of
Kansas, Fort of Nebraska, Hudson of Illi
nois and Brainard of Connecticut. The
object of the committee is to prepare the
constitution and by-laws and make the
congress permanent.
The delesates were tendered a reception
to-taigbt at the Capitol by the Governor
and his staff.
KERN COUNTY'S OLD FEUD.
Reign of Lawlessness Recalled by an
Application to the Governor
lor a Pardon.
BAKERSFIELD, Cal., Dec. 15.â The
application for a pardon for the Gibson
brothers, filed with Governor Budd to
day, reopens the story of a bloody feud in
the mountains of this county. Fletcher
Burton was killed in his cabin by shots
fired from outside several years ago. Just
before his killing the two Gibsons and
Ben Walker were seen together near the
scene. They were charged with tne mur
der, but Walker escaped and was never
caught.
The GiDsons tried to prove an alibi, but
did not try to fax the crime upon any one
else whom they would name. The evi
dence against them was very strong and
they were considered lucky to set off with
sentences of life imprisonment.
Now it is said evidence has been found
showing that one "JacK" Spratt was
guilty. Spratt served a term in State
prison for stage lobbery in this county.
One of the principal witnesses against
him was Fletcher Burton. Spratt claimed
that Burton was engaged in the robbery
and confessed in order to save himself.
Shortly before Burton was kilted Spratt
was discharged from prison, and tie is said
to have been in the county when Burton
was murdered. Tbe charge was made
against him at the time, and he afterward
went to Arizona, where he is now â prob
ably at Tombstone. Another of th* Bur
tons was killed by a man named Allison
in the same neighborhood, but the latter
escaped on the ground of self-defense.
SAN JOSE'S BOLD SUITOR.
District Attorney Herrington Asked to
Protect a Grl From a Trouble
some Swain.
SAN JOSE. Cal., Dec. 15 âMiss Mar
garet Blake, a young dressmaker living at
224 South First street, has complained to
District Attorney Herrington that Joseph
Kabozzi, a would- be suitor, is annoying
her with his attentions. The girl is a
pretty brunette and just above the legal
marriage age, while Rabozzi, who is a
Swiss junkman, is nearly 50 years old. j
Kabozzi lived near tbe Blakes at one time
and was wont to visit the family occa
sionally. He took a great liking to Mar
garet, the eldest of four girls, Â«ni soon his
affection ripened into love. He proposed
to her and she accepted in a spirit of fun.
This was two years ago and since then
Habozzi lias devoted all his spare lime to
ihe girl, much to her annoyance. A few
months aso Miss Blake told him she was
only '"fooling" him and would not marry
him. This enraged Kabozzi and he ap
plied to the Sheriff's office ior aid in forc
ing her to fulfill her pare of the contract.
A deputy Sheriff accompanied him to the
gin's home, but she refused to treat with
him, declaring she would not marry him
"if every hair in his head was a diamond
and every tooth a $20 gold piece."
Since then he has persisted in calling at
the Blake home and pressing his suit.
On November IS he procured a marriage
license for himself and the girl, and he de
clares if she doesn't marry nim before tbe
expiration of the thirty days, which comes
on Thursday, he will have her and her
whole family arrested.

THE SAT* FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 16, 1896.
FINEST OF ALL
WINTER FAIRS
Fresno's Exposition Causes
the Eisiern Man to
Marvel.
New Attractions Added to the
Displays in the Big
Pavilion.
Heavy Fa 1 of Rain Fails to Prevent
a Large Attendance at
Night.
FRESNO, Cal., Dec. 15.â Many of the
citrus fair exhibits were touched np to
day, preparatory to being beheld in
greater radiance by the crowds that are to
come. A sprig of asparagus was added
here, a palm there, a potted plant in
bloom yonder. It is wonderful how a lit
tle ornamentation of this kftid relieves
the general rotundity, collectively and in
dividually, of a mound of lemons or or
anges or apples, or m solid column of dried
fruit. Some have added electricity to
the charms of their displaysâ buds of in
candescent liarht peeping up through the
yellow beds and plants and flowers. An
incandescent electric light glowing in a
bed of oranges is an attractive sight.
This morning dawned with lowering
clouds. Before 10 o'clocK a brisk shower
was falling, and it continued to come
down during the remainder of the day.
During the forenoon there was hardly a
visitor at the pavilion, but during the
afternoon the number (increased, and this
evening, notwithstanding the fact that
rain was still falling, tbe attendance was
larger than last night â the opening night.
And yet raisins, dried fruits of all de
scriptions, orange-, lemons and apples are
not new sights to people of Fresno, and a
theatrical company is playing to a crowded
house nightly at tbe other end of town.
A large number of strangers arrived to
day on tbe north and south bound trains.
The attendance from other sections of the
St.v.c promises to be quite large.
During the rain the sbake roof of the
pavilion never shed a drop of water as big
as a tear. The shake roof is one of the
natural beauties of the San Joaquin Valley
fair. In the day time, whether the sun i 3
shining or not, the shakes, being thin,
show to the spectator inside the pavilion
all the colors and tints of the spectroscope.
When toe sun is seining the effect is par
ticularly brilliant. It makes the pavilion
look as though it had a root of colored
glass. At night the electric lights cause
nearly the same colors to be visible on the
outside.
Tulare County has great reason to be
proud of her exhibit. It occupies about
one-iifth of the entire floor space of 22,400
square feet. It has the name of the
county in dark red and gold fruit running
conspicuously across the wall behind the
display. Tulare County is a leading at
traction at the San Joaquin Valley Citrus
Fair.
There is a fine exhibit of boss pumpkins.
Some of them are as large as a washtub,
child's size. The boss pumpkin of all
weighs 205}^ pounds, and was raised on
"Sargent's canal farm" in San Joaquin
County. If. as Colonel Shaw of Stockton
intimated in his response last night to the
address of welcome, San J o:\quin is not up
to Fresno and the other counties of the
Talley in raising oranges, she is, by the
token ot the canal farm, clearly the ban
ner pumpkin county.
To-night the Hobbs- Parsons Company
addea greatly to the brilliancy of the
general spectacle by the placing of an
illuminated sign over its excellent dis
play. Though tbe exhibit is at the far
side of the pavilion, the glowing electric
sign attracted the crowa.
Diagonally across the pavilion is an
other illuminated sign by tbe Hundred
Thousand Ciub of Fresno. It reAds in let
ters of many colors, "Welcome 100,000
Club." The words are over the entrance
to a very attractive booth, which has been
fitted up and is used for ;he reception and
entertainment ot visitors. It is a secluded
spot to which one may retire for a few mo
ments from th<! bewildering expanse of
fruit and rest in an easy chair. There are
pictures on the wall, Brussels carpet on
the floor and a register in which all
comers are requested to leave their names
"for future reference." There were some
visitors to-day from as far east as Ne
braska.
One of the best exhibits in the fair is
that of San Joaquin County, in charge of
rustling and mesmeric Colonel Shaw. It
shows up the resources ol that county in
line style, from cereals to canned fruits
and from art pottery to spagetti. The
colonel never forgets to mention Stock
ton's achieved and growing importance as
a manufacturing center. He usually adds
with an and-don't-you-foreet-it accent
that Stockton is at the mouth and head
oi the valley. Pictures of Stockton are
plastered a 1 around and over the exhibit.
The colonel promises to get up a citrus
fair at Stockton one of these fine winters
peculiar to the valley that wiil make tbe
people of Fresno and Los Angeles spread
open their eyes like the tail of a peacock .
The St. George Vineyard, which one of
the fair management said is always repre
sented on public occasions of this kind, is
discreetly giving away small samples of
the products of its vines and vats to
friends and admirers. There is nearly
always an ardent lot of admirers around
this exhibit, wondering if the fellows in
side will ever come out.
The ladies of the Christian Church of
Fresno, who secured the refreshment
privilege for the fair, i aye a very at
tractive booth. They sell tamales hot
as â well, only just as hot as really good
church lamales ought to be.
The side phow is one of the features of
the fair. The phonograph fiend and the
Roentgen-ray wonder-worker are here.
Owing to the rain and the absence of
spiders they are not doing a rushing
business. About the first business was
done to-night, when a few gentlemen
wearing overallsâ copper-riveted and war
ranted not to rin, ravel or run down at
the heel â went inside. This incident
shows that the colonies and the remote
regions of the valley are beginning to be
represented at the fair.
The fair shows every indication of prov
ing as much a success financially as it is
as an exhibit of the magnificent cilrns
products of the San Joaquin Valley. It
is the expectation of the enterprising men
of Fre;ino, who have given their time and
their money, many of them at the addi
tional sacrifice of neglecting their own
business, to make the fair "an annual
event. They claim it is tbe first winter
fair of the sort ever held m the State.
With the success of several seasons they
hope to erect, a permanent building. The
present pavilion is only a temporary
structure exected on vacant lots and will
be torn down immediately after the fair.
A small mineral exhibit was added to
day. The Merc?d and Madera counties'
exhibits are substantially completed. In
the former are displays of asbestos and
magnesite.
Premiums of cash or diplomas are hung
uj> by the management for everything ou
exhibition in the fruit and cereal line.
The other countie? recogn ze the courtesy
of a lack oi competition irom Fresno
County for these premiums, and this has
already resulted in a promotion of good
feeliujr. The premiums will be awarded
on the last day. The various individual
exhibits octupy space ranging from 25 to
160 square feet, and stand~~from three to
ten feet hich.
The musical programme is one of tbe
attractions of the fair. There is no lack of
music. The band rehearses in the pavilion
in the forenoon, and in the afternoon and
evening there arts regnlnr programmes,
interspersed with instrumental solos.
There can be no complaint on e;ther the
quality or the quantity of music.
Ihere is some talk of concluding the fair
with v grand bail next Saturday night, if
it is decided to close the fair nt that time.
Governor Buud is expected to visit the
fair one dcy tins week. The day has not
yet been fixed. A special invitation was
sent the Governor and his siaff.
The fair had a wonderfully magnetic ef
fect on a San Francisco liquor-house drum
mer this morning. He produced several
newspapers, some blank paper and a lead
pencil and, holding them in hand, braced
the doorkeeper, saying he represent-d a
San Francisco newspaper. Secretary Web
ster happened lo be looking through one
of the ticket-seller's portholes and recog
nized Hi).'gins. The latter looked that way
at the same instant, and the recogni
tion was mutual. Higgins, who had at
tempted to personate a reporter to save 25
cents admission fee, said:
"Oh, is that you?"
Webster replied that he was still in the
flesh. Hiseins pocKeted the parapher
nalia which he suppospd all reporters
flash on doorkeepers, paid 25 cents without
further remarks and passed inside among
the oranges, lemons and other squashes
and pumpkins. The management hopes
that the fair will have the same attraction
for all other San Franciscans who would,
of course, maKe their bow to the ticket
seller first.
The sky is as clear and the stars as
bright to-night as they can be only over
the San Joaquin Valley, and to-morrow
promises to be a bright day for the fair.
EXCURSION FROM STOCKTON.
alley Jinad Offer* Â»i Free Trip to the
Commercial Association.
STOCKTON, Cal., Dec. 15.â The mem
bers of the Stockton Commercial Associa
tion held a special meeting to-night to
plan for the excursion over tbe Valley
road to Fresno on Thursday to attend tbe
citrus fair. The Commercial Association
has manifested rreat interest in me citrus
exhibit at Fresno, and has been doing
everything in its power to have San
Joaquin County, and Stockton in par
ticular, properly represented. Realizing
the spirit which actuated the menioers of
Stockton's commercial organization, the
management of the Valley road kindly ex
tended to them an invitation to visit
Fresno in a body, going over the people's
road. The offer was accepted, and as
many as can will go to Fresno on the
Valley road excursion train.

ADVANCING SAN
PEDRO'S CLAIMS
Expert Engineers Declare
Its Harbor Site the
Best.
Mass of Evidencs Collected for
Presentation Before the
Commission,
The Valley Railway Enters the Fight
to Tiiwart Huntington's
S:teme.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Dec. 15.â San
Pedro or Santa Monica â which?
The marshaling of tne con tendine forces
in Ihe great harbor contest has been going
on unceasingly nere to-day. Millionaire
Kerns, who is to conduct the San Pedro
right in person in behalf of the Terminal
Railroad Company, is hastening across
the continent at a high rate of speed in
his special train. He is expected to arrive
to-morrow forenoon. A number of his
ablest lieutenants, skilled experts and
lawyers are already on tbe ground; in
fact, his marine and fortification en
gineers have, it is now known, been here
for some weeks quietly at work making
surveys, plats, maj s and charts of the
whole field of marine inquiry at both San
Pedro and Santa Monica. It is said that
this work has already cost Major Kerns
and his associates $10,000, and that $200,
-000 may te expended by these gentlemen
alone before the Government commission
quits Southern California.
The experts have amassed such a huge
bundle of evidence in faror of San Pedro
and of such convincing character as to be
almost overwhelming. Thirj latest inves
tigation lias not only confirmed but
greatly strengthened the several reports
of Government engineers respecting^ the
unquestioned superiority of San Pedro
over IS .i nt a Monica as a site for a deep
water harbor. The scientific evidence
wili be presented to the commission at
the proper tjrne.
A new and powerful element in this con
test is the San Joaquin Valley Railroad
Company, which lias joined the Terminal
Company ir. opposition to the Southern
Pacific monopoly.
Owing to the disgraceful methods em
ployed last spring by the Huntington
forces here, they arc at a great disadvan
tage in the present fight. Wholesale for
gery of names was then resorted to. Th.ei>e
petitions went to Washington, and only
by the merest accident were the forgeries
discovered and the scheme exposed.
There is, of course, no chance for a repeti
tion of these methods. The whole field of
inquiry must now be conducted on decent
lines, with merit as the fundamental basis.
The chairman of the commission is Ad
miral John G. Walker, U. S. N., and the
members are Colonel Richard P.Morgan
of Illinois, Au?ustave Rocers of the Coast
and Geodetic Survey. Georj-e S. Morrison,
a civil engineer of Chicago, and Professor
William H. Burr of the Columbia College
school of mines of New York.
Colonel Morgan has been at the West
minster for several days. W. C. Pratt is
the secretary and disbursing officer of the
commission. He has been in the city
since Saturday evening. AAoairal Wa'ker
arrived from the north this afternoon, ac
companied by Colonel Rogers. George S.
Morrison and Professor Burr are expected
to-morrow morning.
LEGISLATORS ORGANIZE.
Southern California AKsemblymen He
nolre to Co- Operate.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Dec. 15.â The
Southern California legislators spent last
night and this morninjj at tbe W hittier
State cjchool to find what appropriations
will be necessary lrom the coming Legis
lature. The aggresate cost of impreve
ments is about $100,000. Tney include two
additional cottages for boys, to accommo
date fifty each; a trades building to cost
about $30,000, and equipment $15,000; a
separate residence for the superintendent,
to cost $5000; a hospital to cost $7000, and
103 acres of additional land, to cost $200
an acre.
While at Whittier last night the Repub
lican members of the Assembly trom
Southern California met and organized
by the selection of Hen. L. H. Valentinn
of Los Angeles as chairman. The j-urpose
of ihe organization is to present a united
front and co-operate on matters of inter
est peculiar to this section. Members
from Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and
San Bernardino counties were present at
the meeting.
The party returned to Los Angeles at
noon and inspected the State Normal
School and the Protestant Orphans'
Home, after which they departed for
Highlands asylum, for which it is believed
a minor appropriation is required.
AÂ« Star for Or. McLean,
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Dec. 15.â Chief of
Police Glass, to whom the application of
Pastor McLean to be appointed a special
officer, without pay from the city, was last
week referred, to-day made a formal re
port to the Police Board upon the matter.
The Chief recommended that the petition
of Dr. McLean be denied. The Chief's re
port was approved by a unanimous vote,
and Dr. McLean will not wear a police star
this year.
Taylor Charged With Perjury.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Dec. 15.â A war
ra nt was issued to-night for the arrest of
Robert A. Taylor, who figured in the
Smith divorce case, one of the mo^t sen
sational tried here in months. Taylor is
charged with perjury. He swore at the
trial that Smith was an immoral man.
EMPORIUM COMPANY WINS.
It Secures the Contract for Lighting
ionrtii Street.
The Fourth-street Improvement Club
met last evening in Pioneer Hall. In the
absence of the president N. E. Mayhew
presided and William King acted as secre
tary.
J. N. Strauss and P. H. Cahill, chairmen
of their respective canvassing committees
for contributions to the electric lighting
fund, reported very favorable progress.
The Emporium Electric Company put in
bids at $1 75 per arc light for lighting
Fourth street from Market to Fol<o:n as
against the $2 25 of the Edison Electric
Light Company, and was awarded the
contract. The lights will burn till mid
night.
Committees were appointed to raise sub
scriptions among the property-ownerj as
follows:
From Howard to Folsom, Charles Levey, P.
11. Cahill, C. Stockwitz; irom Mission to How
ard. K. E. Mayhew, a. L. Ladd ; from Market
to Mission, J. N. Strauss, William ijcumoltz, J.
T. Sullivan, W. D. Ciuff; from Folsom to Har
rison, John Allen.
F. E. Pratt made many suggestions for
decorating tbe street nt the time of the
demonstration. He suggested flaes across
the streets in tne form known as "flag
lines."
It is the intention to have the street
lighted in ten days, or at least by the first
of the year.

STARTLING PRICES
Grand Jury's Hospital Com
mittee Unearths a New
Scandal.
Public Institutions Supplied With
Chemicals and Charged
Fancy Rates.
Bills Passed as Correct Through
Several Han:'s at Nearly Doub c
\ the Trade Values
The hospital committee of the Grand
Jury has discovered a strange condition of
affairs with regard to the bilis for drugs
supplied the county jails, tne hospitals
and almshouse. An investigation was
made last weeKjinto the prices charged for
drugs and sundry articles supplied by
druggists, and the chairman of the com
mittee, Augu3t Drncker, states that the
City has been paying about two prices in
this.department.
The bills examined were literally
covered with signatures, indorsing their
correctness. Deputy sheriffs, jailers.
Actors signed them as "correct," then
Jr." auditing committee of the Board of
Supervisors accepted these indorsements
and "passed" the bills by appending their
names thereto; and last of ail the Audi
tor affixed the seal cf his approval. Then
the money was paid without* question.
The Grand Jury committee got bills for
drugs, etc., for three or four months past,
and at the same time secured bills from
three druggists wholesale and retail on
the various articles sold to the City. All
tne toil is examined were those of 'Waller
Brothers, the druggists. Here are the
fcgares of the July bills and the trade
prices: Bill $1290. worth $8 40; bill
$90 45, worth $6G56; bill $88 10, worth
f44,0; bill $136 70, worth $80 75; bill
J7 75. worth $4 25; bill $34 55. worth SlB 26;
60S 25, wort ii $43 40 ; bill $133 10, worm
â  S 7; bii $106 75, worth $59 15.
The difference between the warrants for
July and the total sum charged for the
same articles by retailers was figured out
at (26718, on bills, aggregating $678 55. |
Ana yet /or two years the same bills have !
been passed along the line to the Treas- i
ure.r'B otface without ever a question about
prices.
"In the July bil! for County Jail No. 3,"
said Mr. Drucker. "half a eaUon of cough
mixture is charged at $7 50; it can be j
bought for $2 25 in any drugstore. A half I
callon of bromide mixture is charued at !
$6; it can be bought for $2 75. Captain I
J). H. BoyJe marked this warrant correct. I
Whisky is charged at $4 a gallon, and tbc
same grade costs only $2 50. A halPgalion I
of castor oil is put down at $2 75, though
its cosi is 65 cents; two boxes of bella
rtonna plaster?, four dozen, 13 charged at j
$7 20. The price is $3 30 anywhere.
â¢Here's the Coroner's otticeâ the July,
1896, bill. One quart of carbolic acid "is
charged at $1 50; it costs 75 cents. A gal- j
lon of 'solution Billroth' iscnarped at $15. '
1 discovered this â¢solution.' which is used j
as an anesthetic, was cologne water, j
worth $5 a gallon, or one- third o: the price j

cost $7 ~>o, and they cau be pot anywhere |
Ir ?4 â¢-' 'â¢ A eailon of disiniectine solu- i
I .>0; its price is $1 75. The to
al of this bill was $34 55. The same

F|| "Here is a biK for the police patrol for !
July : One gallon of arnica, with demijohn,
You can get the stuff anywhete for
$4 25. This bill is n^ned by Chief Crow- j
ley not a3 'correct,' but simply that he re
ceived, the property mentioned.
"ThÂ£ Receiving Hospital has a bill for
July, the total oi which was $136 70; the
regular pries phouid be $80 73. Nearly
all the articles are outrageously high. The i
Nov-mbsrbill for the Receiving Hospital '
i- $77 84, and it is not yet paid. About
$43 11 would be enousrh for it. A gallon of
Carron oil is put at $3 25; it costs 50 cents.

A DEATHLY CHILL
Charles Miller, a Minor, Almost Driven
Crazy From Loss of Sleep.
Charles Miller, 210 "Washington street,
has been driven almost crazy from the
want of sleep and life haa become s bur
den to nim. '
Monday morning he walked into the
Receiving Hospital and implored Dr.
Bunnell to do something for him, as he
was afraid he would lose his reason. His
eyes were almost bulginc; out of his head
and he was in an enfeebled condition,
"Five days ago," he said, ''I was walk
ing along Washington street when of a
sudden a deatuly chill came over me. I
felt so weak that it took me all my time
to reach home.
"Since then that chill has been upon
me, and for five nights I have not been
able to close my eyes in sleep. At night I
sit up in bed shivering with that cold
chill, and my brain is so busy that sleep
is impossible. If it goes on much longer
I am afraid I will go mad."
He was assigned to a bed in the inebri
ate ward, but he could not rest. He
begged for something to make him sleep,
and in the afternoon Dr. Fitzgiboon gave
him a sleeping potion. Half an hour
latfr he walked out of tiie hospital.
Miller for several years was employed
on steamboats, but in recent years he has
been a miner. He is now 56 years of age,
and had to live up the hard work of min
ing. Since being in the City ha has been
trying to get employment, but without
success. He thinks if he could only get
work the ciaiil would leave him and he
would De able to woo back the drowsy god
again.
MR. HOLBROOK IS ANGRY.
Says That the "Horse-Breaking"
Episode at the H rse Show
Was Cruel.
Carroll Cook, JjJge-Eiect of the Su
perior Court, Also Denounces
the Act.
Secretary Holbrook of the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals is
indignant at the "horse- bre akin a" per
| formance which took place at the horse
show last Saturday night. Mr. Hoi ook
says that there is no doubt that the horse
was broken and trained before it was
brought into the horse show. Its frantic
actions were caused by the spurs which
were cruelly driven into it, mating it
I crazy.
The Society for the Prevention of
I Cruelty to Animals does not "permit the
use of spurs on bucking horses in this
City. Mr. Hoibrook quotes Carroll Cook,
Judge-elect of the Superior Court, con
! cerning the occurrence. Mr. Cook told an
i officer of the society that the exhibition was
{ the most cruel that de ever saw. It took
I him by surprise, as it did others.
"People will wonder," so Mr. Holbrook
I said last evening, "why it was that tne
I society had no officers present to prevent
the happening. The truth is that we did
not suppose that where such people, such
horses and such equipages assembled
anything like cruelty would be coun
! tenanced. We had officers who could hayÂ«
been there just as well as not, but it did
net seem necessary.
"We have made no arrests yet. The
i rider of the horse that made such a sen
j sation la in. the. hospital . with a broken
; collarbone still and may be there for some
j days. The statements made by The Call
I about the happening "were just about
I right." ____^______

RAILROAD BOARD
AGAIN LINED UP
Contest With thfr Southern
Pacific About to Be
Resumed.
Preliminary Con f erencs Between
the Commissioners and
Attorneys.
Proceedings Are Kept as Secret as
Possible Pending a Meeting
Next Monday.
The Sonthern Pacific Company does not
appear to be anywhere near the end of the
contest with the State of California as
represented by the Board of Railroad
Commissioners. In fact, according to
Attorney Fitzgerald, the decision of Judge
McKenna in the United States Circuit
Court, being only upon a preliminary
matter, really has cleared the way for the
trial of the main question al issue.
Since Judge McKen na's decision was given
to the public the Railroad Commissioners
have not openly made any move forward
to farther assert that constitutional au
thority which the court found vested in
the board. But, apparently, the Commis
sioners are auxious to take the next step.
Yesterday afternoon all the Commis
sionersâMessrs. La Rue, Clark and Stan
tonâwent to Attorney-General Fitzger
ald's offices in the Parrott building and
there met the Attorney-General, Robert
Y. Hayne and W. W. Foote, special coun
sel for ttie board. The doors were closed,
the Commissioners and their attorneys
entered into secret session and the as pei:t
of affairs assumed the general appear
ance which characterized the initiation of
the proceedings about one year ago.
Before and after the conference the
Commissioners and the counselors alike
maintained their reticence. The idea was
that it would be unwise to indicate any
part of the next attack to the Southern
Pacific Company. They had with them
while they were conferring neither sten
ographer nor clerk. There is no doubt
that the Southern Pacific Company's law
yers were surprised by the points ad
vanced by Attorney-General Fitzgerald in
the United Btates Circuit Court. The se
crecy maintained up to the time of mak
ing the argument was not without good
effect. On the present occasion the Attor
ney-General will again naturally take the
lead.
From 3 o'clock until late yesterday
afternoon, the doors of the Attorney-Gen
eral's private office were closed. When
they were opened it was given out for pub
lication only that the conference had so
far resulted in nothing definite; that the
Commissioners and attorneys bad engaged
only in a general discussion concerning
the situation, and also regarding what
ought next to be done; also, that no con
clusion nor decision had been reached nor
had any particular line of action been
mapped out. but that further conference
was necessary-, and another meeting
would be held next Monday, when mat
ters may have shaped themselves up more
clearly. At any rate the discussion will
be resumed next Monday.
The proceedings are uot, however, not

withstanding the secrecy with which it is
sought to surround tiieno, wholly a mys
tery. The Circuit Court lett untouched
several important issues, among these be
ing the unlawful combination of trans
portation lines in California in restraint of
competition and the legality of tne leases
by which ttie Southern Pacific Company
operates as one several roads which have
California charters. There is no conceal
ment of purpose that these questions will
be brougnt tip once more at the proper
time.
Upon what seems to be good authority
it is said that the first consideration with
the Commissioners and their special coun
sel is to avoid taking any step which may
embarrass Attorney-General Fitzgeraldjin
the trial of the main question now before
the court, which is the 8 per cent reduc
tion on grain rates as established
by the votes of the Commissioners.
Judge McKenna decided that the Commis
sioners nave power to fix rates, but inti
mated that the court 3 misrht review all rates
that are made to determine their reason
ableness, all things considered, dissolved
the injunction restraining the Commis
sioners from making rates, and also re
fused to take judicial notice oi the resolu
tion to make a 25 per cent general
reduction. There the matter rests. That
is wher- the officials representing the
State take up the contest once more.
"Notning to say," remarked Attorney-
General Fitzgerald last evening when
asked about the conference.
"Nothin â¢ was done" was the version of
Attorney Foote.
The Commissioners were also disin-
I clined to make any positive statement.

HE MUST READ
A RACY NOVEL
Judge Coffey to Pass on
"Was He to Blame; or,
The Temptress."
Written by Mrs. Jessie Milen,
Stepmother of Laura
Milen James.
Eventually the Suor-m? Court Justices
May View the Fiashy Pictures
of the Book.
Judt?e Cofley's courtroom was the scene
of an interesting episode in the trial of the
case involving the estate of the late Dr.
Charles A. Janiej, whe:i Attorney George
D. Shadburne denounced as a conspiracy
the attempt of Sirs, l^aura Milen James
and her associates to secure possession of
the dead man's estate, which is valued at
from $30,000 to $40,000.
This caused much excitement on the
part of Mrs. James and her stepmother,
Mrs. Jessie Milen, for Mr. Shadburne went
further and declared that Attorney W. H.
H. Hart, Mrs. Milen and Dr. Theodore
Milen, father of Mrs. James, were in
terested in tiie scheme.
Mr. Hart smiled indulgently and quietly
remarked that such remarks were im
material, incompetent and irrelevant,
since no such allegations were contained
in the pleadings presented by the learned
counsel on the other side. He mumbled
something about a lawyer with a poor case
resorting to abuse of opposing attorneys.
When the agitation caused by Mr.
Sliadburne's bitter words had subsided
another startling surprise was sprung.
"Did your wife, Mrs. Jessie Milen, ever
write a novel?" asked Mr. Shadburne of
Dr. Milen.
"Yes," was the answer.
"What was thp look named?"
"It was called, 'Was He to Blame ?'
"Was there any other title? Was not
the sub-title 'The Temptress?'
"Yes."
"Is this the book?"
There was another commotion when the
volume was produced, for it had the
appearance of being a flashy and salacious
work. The paper cover was illuminated
with a picture that would take away the
breath of even an Anthony Comstock,
while the other engravines were of a still
more objectionable character.
Mrs. Milen giggled audibly when the
fame of authorship was thus so forcibly
Drought home to her. As she bent forward
to consult with her stepdaughter's attor
neys the sweeping black plumes on her
hat nodded eracefully to and fro. She
blushed furiously as some one of the law
yers turned over the leaves of her boot,
glancing from tiina to time from the text
to the author.
Attorney Hart tried to prevent the ad
mission of the book in evidence, out Attor
ney Shadburne contended tnat the bars
had been let down by Mr. Hart when he
elicited from Dr. Milen that he bad in
trusted the moral training of his daughter
to her stepmother, Mrs. Milen, the author
of this work.
"Dr. Milen swore that he did not give
his daughter moral or religious training

because he confided in her stepmother,
Mrs. Milen, to perform that duty," ex
plained Mr. Shadburne. "We introduce
this book to show the character of litera
ture that emanated from her brain and ,
pen."
Judge Coffey thought this was a legiti- !
mate raetbod to be pursued by the op
ponentsof Airs. James and admitted the !
book in evidence.
Mr. Hart expressed regret that the !
volume should be placed in such a position
that it might havo to go into the record
on appeal, and thus find its way into tne ]
Supreme Court, but this di>l not shake
Judge Coffey's decision, his manner seem
ing to imply, "If we can stand it, they
can," for it was understood that his
Honor would have to read the volume in
order to judge of the qualidcations of its
author to instill moral* precepts into the
mind of a young girl.
Dr. Milen was asKed to give an account
of his, movements jusc about the time of
the death of Dr. James. He replied that I
he was in San Jose practicing medicine at ]
the time of the funeral.
Attorney Shadburne expressed surprise
that he should be absent on the occasion |
of the funeral of his daughter's husband, \
and the witness with great dignity replied : I
"I could not remain here because of my
business in San Jose, which, though not ;
lucrative, necessitated my personal atten- j
tion. You must remember, Mr. Shad
burne, that the practice of medicine is not
a matter of money."
Thereupon Mr. Shadburne took anotner j
tack with the evident intention of trying i
to discredit Dr^ Milen in regard to his
profession*! standing, and finally drew !
from him the information that he was
graduated from a medical school in St. j
Joseph, Mo., after attending two terms of
six months each.
Mildness was the characteristic of Dr.
Milen throughout, and he displayed no re
sentment at Mr. Shadburne's troublesome :
questions about his medical education.
He said he did not have his diploma with
him, but promised to look for it.
Suddenly taking up the book written by
Mrs. Milen, Mr. Shadburne turned to an
engraving representing an almost nude
female lierure and asked:
"Do you know whose picture that is?"
"I do not," was the reply.
"Is it a picture of your wife?"
"No."
"Is it a picture of your daughter?"
"No."
All ttie answers were delivered meekly
by the witness, not the slightest resent
ment of the implied aspersions being ap
parent. Dr. Milen with equal humility
denied that his daughter hud ever been
very fond of a young actor named Collins
or that she had associated with a blind
music-teacher. He also swore that he had
never read his wife's novel, though he
often saw her writing it and knew that it
was published in San Francisco. He
knew she signed herself "Orrell," which
is the name on the title-page as author.
Mr-. James was recalled by Attorney
Hart and again told of the wooing of Dr.
Jams and the signing of tne marriage
certificate. She said that a son, the issue
of her marriage with Dr. James, wus bom
in September.
Fears No Uprising.
Collector of Customs Wise has received a
notice irom the President that the restrictions
aeainst importations of breech-loading fire
arms and ammunition into the Territory of
Alaska have been removed. The islands oi St.
George and St. Paul, the seal islands, are still
under the old restrictions. In 1866, when
Alaska was purchased from Russia, a law
prohibiting the importation of firearms into
Alaska was passed. It was feared that if the
Indians should be armed with modern weapons
they would cause trouble for the white people.
The latter are so numerous there now tbat the
Government does not tear an uprising of the
natives.

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, lia.. Dec. 15.â The wheat market
derived firmness at the opening this rooming from
an advance of lV*d at .Liverpool. That advance
â¢was not fully equivalent to our gain of yesterday,
anl was hardly a reflection of what took place
here Advices from the English market later in the
morning were to the effect that Argentine would
probably have 10.0J0.000 bushels of the present
crop for export, and (hat Russia was offering wm-at
Â»l lower prices than America. These two reports
comblnej to discourage the buyers of yesterday
and selling no->n manifested superior force to the
buying, over a cent decline resulting Receipts in
the Northwest -re liberal 1 at 443 car*. Lust
Tuesday they were 402 cars, and a year ago 1416.

GLADSTONE'S FAMILY LIFE.
Like SI any Another Old Man He Is
Ruled by a Child.
A large-hearted old man who loves
children is sure, no matter bow master
ful he may be, to be ruled by some child.
Mr. Gladstone is no exception. His sunny
little granddaughter, Dorothy Drew,
rules her, illustrious grandfather
as V: imperiously as he ruled his
party in the days of his political
leadership. The Grand Old - Man rinds
pleasure in her companionship, and even
when posed for a picture allows her to clasp
his hand tichtly, as if to force him to keep
qniot. A writer in an American contem
porary says:
Never was a family more truly united
than that of the Gladstones. They con
stitute the most wholesome type of the
British country family, wholesome in
mind and wholesome in body, .and no
breath of dissension or scandal has ever
disturbed the serenity of their mutual re
lations. .
Sons, and daughters, as well as those
who have entered the family. by marriage,
all vie with one another in reverence ana
devotion for ; the one who has done so
much to render the name which they
bear illustrious, a synonym for justice,
piety ana generosity.
But superior to them all on that score is
the "Grand Old Woman," as the vener
able Mrs. Gladstone, the once famous
beauty, Catherine Glynne, is affectionately
described throughout; the United King
dom.
No wife is more watchful and devoted
than she, and Mr. Gladstone has made
few political speeches in Parliament when
she has not sat in the gallery, inspiriting
him with the knowledge of her presence,
and few public addresses outside the walls
of Westminster when she has not sat by
his side, whether on the platform or on
the hustings.
Indeed, on one occasion, when, about
teen years ago, he was called upon to
speak in the open air at Greenwich to an
extremely hostile audience, she 1 won the
day for him by; stand throughout at
his side, holding an umbrella to shield his
silvered locks from the glare of the sun. â

COMES TO LIFE
William J. Dingee Replies
to George de Golia's
Words on Hayward.
Says That the Trouble Is the
. Losing of Control of the Party
by the Attorney.
. Some Interesting Facts Are Discovered
\*. in AUmeda County's New
. ' Great Register.
'. Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,)
![" ' 90S Broadway, Dec. 15. f
* . The Municipal League has come into
the field for the spring campaign. This
is the third lime it has taken, a hand in
local politics, though there is no doubt
that after the action of last Saturday
' the league will not be such . a power as
formerly. New officers were . elected last
( night and Gary Howard is now presi
dent, D. S. Mouiton . vice-president, L. H.
Wakefield treasurer and Henry Maloon
*-_ marshal.
Â»â  The members are considering the re
cent action of the Republican Citj Cen
tral Committee and opinions are about
divided for and against the appointment
/* ot delegates. It was unanimously agreed
, â¢* that the personnel of the special commit
. tee of twenty-one was beyond reproac a,
" but the advisability of the course is ques
* tioned. ' The ieaeue has not yet decided
what part shall be taken in ttie coming
, campaign, nor will this be done until
President Howard names his central com
â  mittee of managers at next week's meet
. m ing.
A careful survey of the new great regis-.
â  ter has been made by Fred A. Poor, and
he has discovered that out of the total reg
â¢ istration of 25,540 names 5090 are native
. Caiifornians, being a considerably larger
number than from any other State or for
â¢ eign country. The total of American
: born voters in this county is 16,200. The
foreigners number 934'J, and of these the
. British-born are nearly one-half, the ma
jority beinc Irish rather than English.
In past campaigns a great deal has been
, said about the large Portuguese vote in
the interior of the county, and it has been
supposed that they numbered nearly 3000.
As a matter of fact there are just 973 peo
- pie born in Portugal and the Western Isl
. ands who reside in this county.
A very interesting little fight ha? sprung
â¢ up between President Dingee of the Oak
land Water Company and George E. de
Gplia, the attorney.
_â¢ ' In an interview published yesterday re
â¢Â°: garding Saturday night's action of the City
â¢ .Central Committee Mr. de Golia said:
' . whole . thing is being engineered by
Frank MoffiU with Alvinza Hay ward's
money, and i have proof of it."
President Dingee to-day made the fol
lowing reply:
" " As I am the business associate of Mr. Hay
; â ward, I desire to be heard. I do not wish to
parade Mr. Hay-ward as a philanthropist,'
a although $2,000,000 of his ami his associates
â is now in the pockets of Oakland working
* mA, but I do not intend to permit any one
like Mr. de Go. la to cast any reflections on
â¢ jim: and remain silent. Mr. Hay ward is a busi- j
ness man, a gentleman, and more money such
as n is Is wanted here. The trouble with De
*> Golia is that he Is rankling with soreness be
cause the Republican committee has taken the
machinery of the party out of his hands and
put it in the keeping of honest men. We do
not care who hoils the municipal offices so
long as they are good men ; neither my enter
prise nor myself is in politics, and we do not
intend to be. - Mr. Hayward's money is not in
Oakland for campaign purposes and not one
dollar will be used lor political purposes.
PEESBYTERY MEETS.
. Oakland's Presbyterian Pastors Con
" " Teui! in the University Town.
BERKELEY, Cal., Dec. 15.â The Oak
land Presbytery met last night and to-day
in the Fir-it Presbyterian Church of
Berkeley. The gathering last evening was
a young people's rally of the Christian
Endeavor societies.
r-.' At the session this morning the report
of the board of foreign missions presented
by S. S. Palmer was the central topic of
â¢ discussion. The report contained a gen
eral review of missionary work now being
carried on throughout the word, which
was praised as being a High form of Chris-,
tian activity. The report followed with
the following four recommendations,
.. which were adopted: . j :vv,
. Firstâ That pastors preach on the subject of
foreign missions on the morning of the second
Sabbath in January. Second â That the
churches during the coming year use the
"new toDies" lor the monthly concert of mis
sions. Thirdâ That the young people's work
be under the care of the presbytery's perma
nent committee of foreign missions. Fourthâ
That we overture the synod to make the syn
odical chairman of foreign missions to hold
his place for at least five years. '
i In accordance with the recommenda
tions Rev. S.S. Palmer and Rev. R. F.
Coyle were appointed a committee on the
matter of younÂ» people's societies sup
porting a foreign missionary. The elec
tion of commissioners to the General
Assembly resulted in the selection of thÂ«
Rev. F. S. .Brush of Alameda and Rev. S.
S. Palmer of East Oakland. Rev. E. F.
'Fish and Rev. it. Logan' of Pleasanton
were chosen as alternates. Elders C. P.
Hoatj and C. M. Buck were also elected
delegates, with R. T. Stewart and George
O. BordwiJl as alternates
To-night a public meeting was held at
the church. Amone the speakers were
President Martin Kellogg of the State
â¢ University, Professor Elmer E. Brown
â  and Rev. F.E. Brush of Aiameda.
â¢ An Ineffective Ordinance.
R BERKELEY, Cal., Dec. 15.â Board
of Town Trustees last night discussed the
rescinding of the new license law by
which Berkeley merchants have been try
ing to secure protection against the com
petition of Oakland merchants. The law
is thought to be a failure, as it has not
vet accomplished any appreciable results.
It was stated that the license of $100 a
quarter could not be collected, and that

WILL ELLIS BE CHOSEN?
Trouble Brewing in the Centen
nial Church of Oak
land.
The Pastor Dares Any One With
Aught to Say Against Him to
Spsai Oat
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Dec. 15. j
The Centennial Presbyterian Churcn,
which has been in charge of Rev. John W.
Ellis, D.D., is ail wrought up over the
question of installing him as its pastor
A meeting was held Sunday evening
which was of such a nature as to cause
weeping in the congregation and a request
by the pastor for any one who had aught
to say against him or his character to
meet him after service. The matter all
came out at the meeting of the Oakland
presbytery ibis afternoon at Berkeley,
I when the question of installing Rev. Mr.
Ellis as past >r of that church was reached.
Elder George S. Prosser reported the
I financial condition of the church, and de- j
I ciared that the expenses were running
J behind, while there was a debt of about
$600 being carried. He declared some of
the trustees lavored closing the church
entirely. This was the cause for Dr.
Ellis to declare that the church was in
debt when he went into it about two
years a;_-o, and that he had been paying
$Gu a month on it.
There was considerable reference to
troubles and opposition to the installation
from some of the churcn people, when, j
finally, Dr. Coyle said he believed it was !
time for Eider Prosser to make spec tic |
! charges. Dr. Ellis turned on E der Pros- i
I ser and asked: "Do you say that morally [
i I am a bad man?" But Elder Prosser !
was not ready to explain his position, so j
remained quiet. Dr. Coyle insisted that
any objections to the installation must be
of a definite character, and urged the
presbytery to install Dr. Ellis as pastor,
and if any one did not like him they j
could leave.
Dr. Ellis, who had been pacing the floor, |
could restrain himself no longer. "If any J
one Knows anything against me," he said,
"man, woman, augels or deviis, I am
here."
Mo'ions wer-- piled one on too of another
until Eider G. A. Bordweil, in perfect sin
cerity, inquired of the moderator: "Where
are we at?' ! Some wanted the charges to
be made specific right then and there,
while others wanted the whole thing re
ferred to a committee for investigation.
iln favor of the latter Dr. Coyle said : "We
don't want to go any further herr or there
will be another big church scandal as a
reproach on religion.
The question as to whether the installa- j
tion should go on or whether there should !
be an investigation vf the charges was j
finally referred to a committee consisting i
or the Revs. R. F. Coyle, H. B. Me Bride
and G. W. Lyon and Eiders R. T. Stewart
and G. A. Bo: dwell.
The commitiee reported unanimously
to request Dr. E lis to take the call under
advisement until the spring meeting of
the Presbytery, and the report was adopted
unanimously. This was considered as ex
pressing a judgment to the effect that if
Dr. E;iis was read aright he could decline
the call before that time.
Dr. Coyle in speaking of this action said,
"It means that during this time an at
tempt will be made to harmonize all fac
lions. This trouble lias nothing to do
with the trouble Dr. Ellis had in San
Francisco, but is only the old troubles of
this church again Being aired.' 1
Miss Eleanor Teitsworth., who has the
largest Sunday -scnool class in the church,
told the following story:
'â¢The trustees last Wednesday met and
by a vote of 9 to 1 decided to call Dr. Ellis
as l astor. The objection waa made to
paying a salary of $2000. Dr. Ellis then
offered to accept ?12uO a year. Sunday be
said from the puipit that there was a
spirit of unrtst, gossip, backbiting and
i talk going on in the congregation about
him and if there were any present who
had anything to say about him or his
character he would like to meet them
after the service. He closed by saying
that the teacher of one of the largest
classes in the Sunday-school was doing
the most talking.
"My mother took exception to this and
decided to have it out with him. She
went up and he met her with an open
hand which she refused. He has done
many things to injure niv feelings. I Nave
taken my class Saturday afternoons to
decorate the church only to find Sunday
that l.c had rearranged the whole thing.
He complained because I did not
! have the class memorize certain
I verses, but instead had them commit
I the psalms to memory, saying I I
was ten years behind the times. Frank !
S. Hastings is our assistant superintendent
j and he has tried to get rid of him. Once
he went to Mr. Hastines saying that he |
was aware his father was ill and if he
wanted to remain away they could get a
substitute to fill his position. He has
chanced the choir from a chorus to a quar
tet, so as to get rid of a number of young
i people who sing."
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 16, 1896.
WORK OF HIGH
SCHOOL GRADUATES
The Class of '96 Gives Proof
of Its Ability to Earn
Diplomas.
Artist Hoffman Furnishes a
Poster of a Typical Girl
Graduate.
M ss Vrooman Prophesies, Miss White
head Says "Farewell" and Charles
Ayres Handles Fruit Cans.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Dec. 15. J"
The High School graduating class of
1896 has just issued their own edition of
the "JEgis." The writers have taken up
for their class essays many interesiing
subjects and have handled them with a
degree of discretion and ability which is a
credit alike to them and their institution.
The class consists of thirty-six gradu
ates, about equally divided between boys
and girls, and they announce as their
motto:
Ah ! but a mail's reach should exceed his grasp,
Or what's a heaven for?
The class artist, John D. Hoffman, has
drawn a poster which represents a typical
high school erauuateoi the class of '96,
and it compares favorably with the work
of many older artists.
Miss Lucy Vrooman makes a class
prophecy which has much more merit
than is usually found in similar theses.
She carries the various members of her
class through their respective futures and
prophesies for them distinction which will
land them far higher up the ladder of
fame than many of them will doubtless
fulfil!.
The practical side of life is handled by
Charges P. Ayres, who deals not in prophe
cies or visions, but in the details of the
practical making of fruit cans. If Mr.
Ayres has learned all his information in
this Drancu of manufacture In the Oak
land High School the education there im
parted is certainly more practical than
that of any other hi/h school in the land.
For a high school graduate, the author on
â¢'How Fruit Cans Are Made" must have
been remarkably industrious.
The "Farewell" of the class is written
by Miss Louise Whitehead and, if she ex
presses the bentiments of her fellow grad
uates, Principal McChesney stands very
high in their estimation, for she acknowl
edges that his efforts have been directed
toward making them "love learning for
learning's sake.' 1
The class history is written by Eugene
W. Roland, and he recites briefly but
cleariy the various stages through which a
giaduate passes from initiation to gradua
tion.
Judging from the experience of some of
its members, the graduates of '96 cannot
fail to prove very daring in their future
lives, for many of the scrapes to which
Mr. Roland refers must have required
more grit than is usually found even in
high sciiool boys.
Miss Margaret Troili is the class poet.
It would tatce too much space to repro
duce her effort, but she gl.des smoothiy
along from Shelley and Keats down to
Wordswortn and Browning and her oo'em
is one of the best of its k;nd that has ema
nated from :he High School.

from the Mission hills and so filled the gutters
of streets that are laid out east and west that
it became necessary to lift the culvert covers
to admit the water into the sewers. The flow
waÃ so great at some points that the sewer on
Howard street was not strong enough at some
points to stand the unusual strain. At Thir

very serious.
THE TAPIOCA CASE.
Judge McKenna Decides Against Col
lector Wise in -hi* Matter.
United States Circuit Judge McKenna
Monday gave a decision against Collector
of Customs John H. Wise in the so-called
starch cases, twenty-three in numbex.
Some time ago a number of Chinese firms
imported a preparation that Collector
Wise considered to be starch, and Imposed
a duty of 2 cents per pound. The stuff
was for eiving a gloss to laundered gar
ments. The Chinese claimed it was a
form of tapioca and exempt from duty,
and they appealed to the United States
Board of General Appraiser?, who decided
that it was really a form of tapioca or
tapioca flour. The Collector was not sat
isfied with the decision and took the case
to the Circuit Court. Judge McKenna
decided adverse to the Collector, stating
that thp judgment of such an authority
as the Board of Appraisers was not to bo
overlooked or disregarded.

BEFORE ELECTRICITY
An Era of General Im
provement Permeating
the City.

tion.
From North to South tin Electric
Ray Will Spread the Joyous
Tilings.
Provision of electric arc lights in all the
business streets of the City is now the in
dication of a general desire to bring San
Francisco to the front as it never waa in
the past.
The benefits to trade in the drawing of
thousands of parsons into Polk street dur
ing tne evening hours since the merchants
of that thoroughfare had the arc lights
swung over the center of their street have
acted as an impetus to other merchants
and property-owners on streets that are
practically business centers for their re
spective localities, stirring them to em
ulate this example; and a^ a result San
Ifrancisco will, before the winter mouths
pass, be illuminated by electric lights,
givinc stores and dwellings a midday in
stead of a shadowy appearance, such as
they presented before the era of progress
and improvements sot in.
To accomplish this desirable end resi
dents of several outside business streets
have moved in the matter, with the result
of forming improvement clubs.
Powell street, from Martet to Geary, if
President Friedlander's intentions are
carried out, will eclipse all others in the
uniqueness of the display wnich will greet
the public on Christmas eve, if not before.
At a meeting of the club of which Mr.
Friedlandor is president, held yesterday
afternoon in the parlors of the Columbia
Theater, A. L. Pyser of the woolen mills,
W. H. Harrison and C. C. Haub were
added to the executive committee.
Ninth street is not going to be left be
hind in the general forward march, and
in this movement the fondest hopes of
John Hayden, the butcher, who was the
first to introduce electric lie .ts in his shop
on t is street will materialize inio reality.
At a meeting beld in Hibernia Hall on
Monday evening a club was organized
with the following ofheers: President, M.
A.Owens ; vice-president, John Haden ; sec
retary, J. F. Renault; treasurer, H. M. D.
Meyer.
It was reported that there was sufficient
money in hand to guarantee the lighting
with arc lamps of the two blocks from
Market to Howard. The Merchants' As
sociation has signed a contract with the
electric light company for five lights over
ench block, and the lights may possibly be
in position by Saturday.
A. H. Cousins stated that he had already
fourteen signatures signed lor lighting the
block between Howard and Jtalsom, and
the prospects were good for securing the
additional names needed to guarantee the
necessary lamps to that street, which will
thea swing from Market to Folsom.
Stockton street will hitch on to the big
celebration to be held by the Kearny
street and Montgomery-avenue residents
on next Saturday nixbt. Theciubrecently
signed a contract for a year with the Edi
son Light and Power Company to light
Stockton street from Green to Pacihc.
Three arc lights will be placed in each
block. The company began stringing wire
through the street yesterday.
The executive committee, consisting of
Albert Bear, L. A. Rea, D. Donovan, J.
I Kitterman, J. Wessell, W. Kuttner ami
David Lowenstein, decided to report in
iavor of making as large a demonstration
Saturday evening as the funds in the treas
uier's hands will permit. The buildings
along the lighted portion of the street will
be decorated with flags and bunting.
The Fillmore-street Improvement Club
are using every effort to get things in
shape for the illumination of their thor
ouglilare next Saturday evening. Fire
works and music will form important
factors of tlie programme which tne club
has planned. Residents of the street are
taking an active part in the matter and
will iiluminate and decorate their dwell
ing-houses. The Fillmore-street Im
provement Club has absorbed into its or
ganization the business men of California
street between Fillmore and Steiner, and
they propose to decorate both the busi
ness sections named.
Saturday night will also be a memora
ble night with the residents on Sixteenth
street from Guerrero to Folsom, as this
street wi Ibe lighted. The proceedings of
the residents of this locality, in meeting
Monday, are fully reported by The (all.
A permanent organization has been ef
fected by the Larkin-street Improvement

TUGGED A DRAW.
Italy and Norway Compete at Sutrovillo
and the Two Strong Teams Prove
Equally Matched.
Attendanca at Sutroville Monday night
was not so large as on the previous day,
owing to the inclemency of the weather.
But this little drawback did not in the
least detract from the grit and determina
tion of the competitors to tug on the hemp
with ail possible force.
The first teams to put their heels against
the cleats were Germany vs. America,
and in this Uncle Sam's citizens had the
bar knocked down on their side in three
minutes and twenty seconds. The betting
on this issue was 2 to 1 in favor of the
winners.
Canada vs. Slavosia next took their
places and tugeed for 12 minutes and 28
seconds, when the Canadians came out
the winners. The betting on this issue
was 5 to 1 on Canada. The Slavonians
substituted Arreid Tkach, Joe McMahon
and Gus Torrall for three of the team that
pulled yesterday, but even this did not
save them from defeat.
Old Ireland sent seven brawny sons to
compete with Sweden, but 9 minutes and
SEW XO-DAT.
Thousands of people are coffee-
sick â bilious, nervous, sleepless,
dyspeptic â that's what coffee-

ful substitute for coffee called

POTTER & WRIOHTINGTON,
Boston, flass
38 seconds was sufficient to send them to
their rooma a crestfallen team. The bet
tins: on this result was 5 to 1 on the
winners.
Denmark vs. Portugal were t c next to
mount the platform, and in 4 minutes and
10 seconds the Danes had pulled the per
pendicuiar bar over the line- The betting
on the result of this tug waa 20 to 3in
favor of the winners.
The last and best pull of th 9 evening
was between Norway and Italy, with bet
ting 2tol on the Norwegian team. From
the word po until ;he limited time of
thirty minutes had been reached there
was no relaxation in the strain on the
rope.
During the first twenty minutes Italy
had pained about eighteen inches, when
the Norwegian team set its teeth and
heels and tugged and pulled, drawing the
rope away from its adversaries until it
was within the sixteenth part of an inch
of the winning point and was about to
knock the crossbar down, when C. W.
Freese, the referee, blew his whistle,
which left the contest a draw.
The enthusiasm during this entire con
test had been unbounded.
The attendance yesterday was much
better than on the previous night and tbe
contending teams showed, if anything,
renewed vigor in the struggles to achieve
victory.
The first contest of the evening was be
tween Sweden and Slavoiiia. The betting
was sto 1 on the Swedes, but there was
no Slavonian money in sight. The wis
dom of this was seen from the time the
men topic their places on the cleats, as the
Slavonians kept losing gradually until the
Swede?, with one lurch, brought the per
pendicular bar against the crosspiece,
wheu they were declared the winners in
9 minutes and 12 seconds.
The next contest was between the
Americans and Denmark. The betting
on this contest was 10 to 4 in favor of
Denmark, but this condition changed to
2to 1. Denmark had gradually drawn to
their side until they covered six cleats,
when the Americans, by one grand spurt,
recovered their lost ground and aftar a
short rest of a few minutes started to run
tne carriage along the track until the
crossbar fell. The result of this contest
brought the house down with a roar of
applause. This is the first instance in
which the short-enders won.
frThe third contest was between Portugal
and Norway. The betting on this result
was sto 2 in favor of Norway, but this
kept changing until it was 10 to 2, with
even rnonev thai Norway would win in
five minutes. It only required one min
utes and twenty seconds, however, until
tbe Norwegians had won.
The third contist was between Ireland
and Germany. The betting on this was
10 to 3on Ireland. Germany was not in
it, for in five minutes and thirty-eight
seconds ForbÂ»s' pistol announced that
tbe late of Germany had been sealed.

THE METHOD OF A GREAT TREATMENT
FOR mmm OF MES.
WHICH CITIIKD HIM AFTER EVERY-
THING ELSE TAILED;
Painful diseases are bad enough, but when a
man is slowly wasting away with nervous
weakness the mental forebodings are ten
times worse than the most severe pain. There
Is no let up to the mental suffering day or
| night. , Sleep is almost impossible, and under
<â  such a strain men are scarcely responsible for
, what they do. For years the writer rolled and
'tossed on the troubled sea of sexual weakness
until " it was a question whether he had not .
better take a dose of ; poison and thus end all'
bis throubles. But providential - inspiration
came to his aid in the shape of. a combination
of medicines that not only completely restored
the general-, health, but enlarged his weak,
emaciated parts to natural size and vigor, and
he now declares that any man who will take
the trouble to send his name and address may
have the method of this -wonderful treatment
free. .Now, when I say free 1 mean absolutely
without cost, because I want every weakened
man to get the benefit of my experience.
. I am not a philanthropist, nor do I pose as
an enthusiast, bur there are thousands of men
suffering the ; mental tortures of weakened
manhood who would be cured at- onca could
they but get such a remedy as the one that
cured me. Do not try to study out how I : can
afford to pay the few postage-stamps necessary
to mail the information, but send for it ami
learn that there - are ai' few ; things on earth
that, although they cost nothing to eet, urn
worth a fortune to some men and mean a life-
time :â  of happiness , to most of us. Write to
Thomas Slater, box 2283, Kalnmazoo, Mich.,
and the information will be mailed in a plain
sealed envelope. :~ ::'â¢â . \ s:

OUTSIDERS LIKED
THE MUDDY GOING
Personne at 40 io i a Warm
One at Oakland
Track.
Some Cheap Racing That At
tracted Only a Fair At
tendance.
Reddington Gave Mt. Gregor Quite an
Argument â Alvarado Bat Hi 3
Fieid Galloping.
Possessed of no specially attractive
features the racing card at Oakland yes
terday drew a much lighter crowd than
that which attended the opening day.
The rain held aloof, but the going was
very sloppy and tnree pronounced choices
were laid low.
Jockey Golden, who now rides for Louis
Ezell, came quite prominently before the
public by riding two winners and finish
ing in the place with Kamsin. He ap
pears to be quite a promising rider.
Mr. Ezell chose the opening five and a
half furlong spin for nob-winning two
year-olds to cut loose quite a promising
maiden in Nonchalance, a half brother to
the Eastern performer Hanweli. The
stable got 4 to 1 for their money and com
ing on from the far rear Golden made a
short cut into the stretch with the young
ster, and outstaying the even-money
choice, Sly, with Staw up, got the verdict
by a head. Manzanillo was a fair third.
There were six starters in the mile sell
ing affair, with Palmerston, 7to 5, favor
ite. Gardner got him away from the post
poorly and cc was never better than third.
Cleverly ridden by Slaughter, Pollock
moved up from fourth position in the
stretch and won with littie to spare from
Earl Cochran. Show honors went to La
Flecha, which mare showed a good turn
of speed.
The majority of speculators overlooked
t'.e last run of Personne, and as one of
the eight -tarters iv the six-furlong spin
for two-year-olds he was a despised out
sider, a few of the books laying 40 to 1
against the colt. Osric II was a warm
6 to 5 favorite, with Principle and Roy
Carruthers next fancied in the order
named. At the head of the stretch, with
D. J. Tobin showing first and the others
well bunched, the result was in doubt.
Coming around his company on the out
side Golden on Personne assumed com
mand of things and finished with some
thing to spare a couple of lengths betore
Scorcher, which gelding headed Tobin
out for the place.
The Burns & Waterhouse entry, Mt. Mc-
Gregor 11, starting a 2 to 5 favorite, acain
turned up a winner in the fourth race,
over thirteen- sixteenths of a mile. Ked
dmgton put up a very strong argument
until well into the stretch, where he
faltered, and the first choice led him over
the mark a length, in the fast time of
1:20]4. Tempestuous was a distant third.
The seven-furlong run that concluded
the programme went to Aivarado â the
even-money choice in the betting. Martin,
who had the mount, got a living start
and, galloping away in front, the fast
mudlark beat Kamsin out two lengths
very easily. Jack Richelieu, at odds oi
100 to 1, ran third.
Notes.
Willie Flynn was suspended for a sus
picious-looking ride astride Joan in the
fourth race.
Chp.rles Ireland of the racing firm of Ire
land Bros, arrived from the East on Mon
day night. Mr. Ireland is much taken
with the appearance oi the two big tracks
controlled by the iocal jockey clubs. The
cup horse Grannan will represent the firm
in future race 3 nere.
Tne Oakland officials in the stand are
looking into the peculiar phases of form
displayed by Wood chopper.
Sam Dogeett, the popular jockey, ana
his brother, K. Doggett, are back with us
ag;;i:i this winter. The two riders got in
from the East Monday evenin .
T. Murphy was censured by the judges
for not perseverins more with Reddini;
ton. Tlie ycurm man has v habit of ''giv
ing up the -.'host" too readily.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 16, 1896.
PROGRESS FOR MT. ZION
Active M asures Adopted to Aid
the New Hospital at
Oace.
The Polyclinic to Be Started Without
Delay and Building Will
Soon B gin,
A meeting of the directors of the Mount
Zion Hospital Association was held last
evening at the committee rooms of the
Congregation Suerith Israel, Joseph
Brandon stein, president, in the chair. A
discussion ensued upon the report of a
committee appointed to draft plans for
the carrying out of the desire of this asso
ciation, which is to found and support a
hospital and polyclinic supported by the
Jewish community. Tnis is to afford
medical aid and assistance to the deserv
ing sick poor, irrespective of race or creed.
The funds at present at the disposal of
the association, w.iile they are consider
aDle, are inadequate to permit the direct
ors to put the plans in full operation.
The directors do not feel justified in at
once proceeding to erect a building, but
have determined to start a hospital and
polyclinic temporarily, so as to demon
strate to the Jewish community the abso
lute need and Uesirauiliiy of such an in
stitution.
In order to awafcen interest in the ven
ture it has been further determined to
issue a circular, a copy of which is to
be mailed to members of the Hebrew
faith, setting forth the aims and objects
of the institution and inviting them to
designate what amount they will sub
scribe to the association and its work.
The association has a lot at Point Lobim
avenue and Sixth avenue, opposite tlâ¢
French Hospital, and will in time build,
it has beeu decided to use temporarily
Dr. Kosenstirn's private sanitarium at
fcSutter and Hyde streets.
The staff is composed of the following
physicians: Surgeon. Dr. J. Rosenstirn;
physician, Dr. C Levisun; gynaecologist,
Dr." Oscar T. Mayer; oculist and aurist,
Dr. T. D. Arnold. Tue polyclinic staff is
composed of the following: Dr. H. B. de
Marville, Dr. W. P. Nathan, Dr. Jellinek,
Dr. Krotozyner, Dr. H us and Dr. Pischl.

NO CHANGE IN
THE LAW FIRMS
Delmas & Shortridge Will
Not Dissolve Partner
ship.
Nor Will the Partnership of
Bishop & Wheeler Be
Dissolved.
The Mcst Cordial Relations Exist in
the Firms ss They Stand at
the Present Time.
The story that the law firm of Delmas &
Shortridge was to be dissolved at the
beginning of Ihe year created some sur
prise among the legal fraternity when it
was given currency yesterday. The gen
tlemen most deeply concerned agreed per
fectly in their denial of the truth of the
canard. They stated with one accord that
there was r.o dissolution threatened of
that partnership and that no steps had
been taken or plannpd toward the organi
zation of a new firm between D. M. Delmas
and Thomas B. Bishop.
Mr. Delmas, who had just returned from
San Jose, where he had been attending upon
a matter of importance pending in' the
courts there, was seen at his office yester
day afternoon. When he was asked if the
firm of Deimas & Shortridge was to be
dissolved by the lirst o f the year he indig
nantly replied, "No; nothing of the kind
has ever been mentioned or thought of."
"Is a firm of which you and T. B.
Bishop are to be the members to be organ
ized?"
"No, I have the highest regard for Mr.
Bishop and have been associated with
him in proceedings of the Lux estate, but
the idea of forming a partnership with
him has never been even remotely hinted
at by us or either of us.' 1
"Is it true that your relations with Mr.
Shortridge have not been pleasant, and
that you exchanged warm words not long
ago, and that there is a breach between
you'"
"No, certainly not. It is now three
years, lacking a few days, since we have
been together, and during the whole of
that period not a shade of unpleasantness
has existed between us; not a word that
was not of the most friendly character has
ever Deen exchanged, and our relations
are now as close, cordial and intimate as
from the start o.r as any mortal could
desire."
When Mr. Delmas was further asked if
he was annoyed or inconvenienced by the
attention and time which Mr. Shortridge
bestowed upon politics during the late
campaign he said: "So. no. Mr. Short
ridge's obligations to his party we;e well
tnown to me. The time spent by him in
the campaign in no way interfered with
the discharge of his duty to the firm, and
the idea that I in any manner found fault
with him for absence in canvassing the
Suite lor his party or that I did not con
sider him entitled to share in the earn
ings oi the office on that or on any other
account is absolutely without foundation."
Samuel M. Shortridge was seen as he
was returning from the City Hall and
asked about the story. He said : "I have
not time even to deny such baseless
rumors." Being pressed for some expres
sion he smilingly said, "You had better
see Mr. Delmas." Later he said: "The
relations between Mr. Delmas and myself
are and always have been of the most inti
mate and pleasant nature. There has
never been the least friction between us.
Our association is of a social as well as of
a business nature, and there is no thought
or desire on the part of either Mr. Delmas
or myself to sever our relationship. As
to the partnership existing between
Mr. Bishop and Mr. Wneeler I am in
formed that their connection is of the
most agreeable character and will con
tinue."
Cnarles S. Wheeler, when peen at
his office, said: "Â£o far as I know
there is no truth in the report that
Delmas & Shortridge are about to dissolve
partnership. I know that there is none
in the story that a new partnership is to
be formed between Mr. Delmas and Mr.
Bishop. I have every reason to believe
that the most perfect accord exists be
tween Mr. Delmas and Mr. Shortridge.
Certainly my relations with Mr. Bishop
are of the most cordial and satisfactory
nature."
Mr. Bishop, when seen at his residence
last evening, said:
"Mr. Deiraas and myself have never dig
cuss-ed in any way the question of partner
ship, ali hough we are oid friends.
"Personally, I have already partners â
younger men â connected with me in
â¢whose future I am much interested. I
have no idea of making any changes or oi
forming any new relations.
"lamquiie sure that no such thought
has evpr entered the mind of Mr. Delmas."
Mr. Bishop further stated that he had
never previously been interviewed on the
subject of a partnership between himself
and Mr. Delmas.
Irom interviews with all the gentlemen
interested it appears that the publication
of the story that these two prominent
firms would be dissolved was made with
out any authority whatever and without
even inquiring of any of the persons con
cerned. ______^^__^__

HE WOULD HAVE
FOOTE REMOVED
George Monteith Files
Charges Against the
U. S. Attorney.
Says H? Entered Into Collusion
With the Defendant's At
torney to Defeat Justice.
Also That He Withheld Facts From
the Court and Failed to Notifj
the Prosecuting Witness.
Attorney George AY. Monteith, as attor
ney for Alfred Isson, has sent a commu
nication to President Cleveland and to
Hon. Jnd9on Harmon, Attorney- General
of the United States, preferring charges
against United States District Attorney
Henry S. Foote, and asking his removal
from office. The charge is that of collu
sion with the defendant's attorney in a
criminal Case to defeat justice.
Isson was the prosecuting witness in
the suit against George Stierlen, on three
indictments for sending obscene matter
through the mails â the letters being writ
ten to Isson's wife. Stierlen was allowed
to plead guilty on one of the indictments
and the other two were nolie prosed. It
is alleged that Foote advanced the day of
Stierlen's arraignment on the calendar
without notice to the prosecuting witness
or to the postal authorities, and that he
deceived the court as to the gravity of the
case; that Stierlen was brought into
court, allowed to plead guilty, lined $500
and the other two cases dismissed belore
the postal authorities or IsÃon could rpach
the courtroom after the brief notice given
them. Following is the text of the com
plaint sent to the President, which inci
dentally tell Isson's rather remarkable
story:
To Grnver Cleveland, President of the United
States: Alfred Isson, a citizen oi the Doited
States and of the State of California, residing
at the City of Sun Francisco in said State, now
makes, riles and presents herewith the sub
joined charges against Henry S. Foote, attor
ney for the United States in and for the North
ern district of California, and because thereof
desires the removal oi the said Foote.
And in this behalf he 6tates:
That in the latter part of the year 1894 the
complainant, the said Alfred Isson. went to
Tapacnula, State of Chiapas, in the republic
of Mexico, to temporarily engage in business
at that point; that his wile remained in San
Francisco until the month of December, 1894,
at which time she left to joiu him in Tapu
chula; that during the interim between the
time he himself left San Francisco and the
time his wife left the complainant's said wife
became involved in illicit relations with one
George Siierlen, who was then the husband of
the complainant's sister, Emma Stierleu.
That after remaining in Tupachula for
about three months the complainant's said
wife upon March 17, 1895, returned to San
Francisco lor the purpose of making pur
chases of goods for the complainant. That
about the time of her departure she informed
the complainant that a lady friend of hers re
siding in Stockton, Cal., would address her
several letters, and which would be addressed
to her as Mrs. W. G. Steele, and particularly
requested complainant not to open or ex
amine the same. That soon after the de
parture of complainant's said wife for San
Francisco as aforesaid letters began to arrive
addressed to "Mrs. W. G. Steele," and live in
all arrived, copies of which are hereunto
attached aud marked exhibits A. B, C, D and
E, and to which reference is hereby made.
That said letters remained in complainant's
possession for several weeks, until: his bus
picion being aroused he opened them and dis
covered their contents. That complaint there
upon telegraphed his said wife to return im
mediately, which she failed to do, but did in
the latter part of May, 1895. lake passage for
Tapachula upon the steumship Colima, which,
on its way down the Mexican coast, sank in
the Pacific Ocean, and complainant's said wife
was drowned.
That each of said letters aboveireferred to
and marked exhibits A to E inclusive were
mailed at the Postcffice of the United States in
the City of San Frnncisco aforesaid and duly
bore the postmark thereon.
That upon complainant's return to Snn
Francisco he placed said letters Is the hands
of the postal authorities at San Francisco, but
at that time the question of the liability for the
sender of such letters through the mail was
then pending in the Supreme Court of the
United States, and no action could be taken
'.hereon.
That complainant in November, 1895, ad
dressed the Attorney-General of the United
States relating to said letters, and upon Janu
ary 10 received from him an answer which is
marked exhibit F and attached hereto. That
upon May 15. 1896, the Attorney-General of
the United States again addressed complain
ant, and a copy of the letter is hereunto at
tached and marked exhibit G.
That upon the receipt of the last-named
letter the complainant went Defore the Fed
eral Grand Jury, who upon the 21st of Aug
ust, 189b, presented an indictment containing
three counts, charging the said George Siht
len with the violation of the laws of the
United States with reference to deDositing
obscene mail matter in the mails of the
United States. That the said three counts re
lated to exhi bits A, B and v, being the letters
dated March 3, March 17 and February 23. re
upectiveiy. Thatiifter v great deal of trouble
the postal authorities finally located the naid
Stierlen in Fargo, X. D., to which place he fled
to avoid arrest. He was thereupon
brought back to the City of San Francisco
and bis case upon said indictment set for ar
raignment upon the 15th day of December,
1896.
That complainant, feariDg that Henry 8.

Foot", the District Attorney, would not do his
fu.l duty in the premises, employed his owu
counsel to be present when saM cuse should
be tried. Tliat his said counsel so iuiormed
the said Foote. That saM Foote, very soon
after being informed of the employment of
special counsel by complainant, and without
givinu any previous notice to either the postal
authorities or to complainant or to complain
ant's said counsel, chanced the time of ar
raignment with said George Stierlen in the
I'nited Slates District Court, wherein said in
dictment was {>enditig before Hon. W. \V. Mor
row, the Judge thereol, from the sth day of
December, 1890, to the 10th dsy of December,
1890, and by arrangement with the said
George S.ierlen and M. P. Eisner, his attorney,
went before the Unned Stales District Court
aforesaid at 11 o'clock upon the morning of
December 10, 1890. allowing the said Stierlen
to plead guilty to the first count In said in
dictment, which was based upon said letter
marked exhibit A, and being the letter dated
Marcn 3, 1895. and that the said District At
torney Foote did not, as was his duty under
I the circumstances, submit said letters to the
court ior its information, but withheld the
same, and upon the said Stierlen being fined
ln the sum of .SSOO, dismissed the action upon
the second and third counts.
That the Postal Inspectors were no* notified
until 10:20 o'clock of the morning of Decem
ber 10, 1890, as aforesaid, as complainaut was
informed and believes, and were unable to se
cure the presence of complainant until it was
too late to do anything in the premises.
That complainant charges the said Henry
S. Foote with having taken the action above
referred to in pursuance of a corrupt and un
lawful agreement or understanding with the
said Sderlen ana his attorney, whereby the
said Stierlen should be permitted to go free
upon the payment of a small fine, to wit, $500,
as aforesaid.'and the said Stierleu being a man
of large means would not be seriously pun
ished thereby.
And this charge complainant makes upon
his information and belief, and upon the facts
and circumstances of the case above set ferth.
Complainant further charges the said Henry
S. Foote with having willfully deceived the
Tinted States District Court with reference to
the character and nature of the charges
against the said Stierlen, by withholding the
said letters and not giving the court an oppor-
I luiiity to know and to understand the nature
and extent of the offenses of the said Stierlen
as aforesaid.
This complainant avers upon his informa
tion and belief and upon the facts and circum- I
stances within his knowledge as herein set i
forth.
Complainant therefore earnestly petitions
his .Excellency the President of the United
States, to cause due and proper investigation
of the charges herein made to be hud, and if
the same be found to be true and as above
charged and stated that the said Henry S. j
Foote b3 dismissed and removed from nis said |
office as attorney of the United States in and '
for the Northern District of the State of Cali
fornia.
Isson's affidavit is attached to the docu
ment.
THE PICTURE NOT FOUND.
Yon Tiedeman Waxing Fat Over the
Prospect of His Acquittal.
The missing photograph In the Carl yon
Tiedeman perjury cass has not been
found, and another lecture from Judge
Wall. 'ice is to be expected unless it can be
found before the opening of court this
morning.
Chief Depnty County Clerk Piper said
yesterday that he did not think the pic
ture ever passed into the possession of the
County Clem's office. He explained that
when Yon Tiedeman was acquitted on the
charge of forgery there was not the slight
est expectation of any officer of the court
that the photograph would ever be wanted
again, and he supposed it had been treated
as so much waste paper. That would
have been a natural disposition of the
matter. If Yon Tiedeman had wanted it
no one would have objected to letting him
have it, but there is no record showing
that it was delivered to him.
When the accusation of perjury was pre
sented against Yon Tiedeman all the pa
pers and exhibits in the case were deliv
ered to the District Attorney and were in
that officer's possession and in the posses
sion of the Grand Jury for several weeks.
Mr. Piper says that the County Clerk's
office cannot be held responsible for the
sale-keeping of documents that are passed
in this indiscriminate manner.
In the meantime Yon Tiedoman is grow
ing plumper, handsomer and more con
tented-looking. If that photograph is not
found it will be almost impossible for the
District Attorney to secure his conviction.
GRAFF'S EPITAPH.
He Wrote It in Advance and Left
Money to Pay for It.

Han Francisco, who died in Blasewitz,
Saxony, on the 26th of last October, has

HAPPY FESTIVAL
OF LITTLE ONES
Children of the Day Homes
Gathered at the Audi
torium.
An Enjoyable Entertainment
Preceded the Appearance of
Santa Claus.
Christmas Gifts Bestowed Upon the
Children of Hard- Working
Parents.
Santa Clans was in town yesterday and
spent the afternoon at the Auditorium,
where the Sisters of the Holy Family gave
a Christmas festival to the children of the
Sacred Heart, St. Joseph and St. Francis
day homes. In honor of his coming the
Auditorium had been prettily decorated,
the entrance presenting a particularly
attractive appearance with its rows of tall
palms and arches of bolly- berries.
The stage likewise took on a festive air,
with ferns and holly- berries arranged
artistically here and ihere. The little
ones began to arrive at 2 o'clock, each one
arrayed in his or her best bib and tucker,
and each little face bright with expectancy.
There were (JOO of them, and they repre
sented the children of hard-working par
ents to whom Christmas is not always a
time of cheer; indeed, to many of them
the necessities of life are a luxury.
But Santa Claus did not forget those
dear little children this year. He had
something for each and every one of them,
and they knew it, too, so it is no wonder
they were brimful of good nature and wore
such great broad smiles, for they had
heard all about Santa Claus, and knew he
was coming yesterday afternoon and was
going to bring a great load of toys. It
didn't matter that it stormed, for Santa
Claus had promijed to be ttiere, and they
knew he wouldn't disappoint them.
They haa prepared a delightful little
programme, and in the opening chorus
their voices rang out clear and sweet upon
an audience that rilled the house. The
little ones had been splendidly drilled and
acted their separate parts to perfection.
When the chorus "Santa Claus will
soon be here" had been sung with all the
enthusiasm of childhood the little ones
grew wild with delight. Sure enough he
did appear, and he wasn't a make-believe
Santa ClauÂ«, but a real live one with a
flowing white beard and weariiii; a great
stout coat. He was blowing a trumpet
most furiously, but he couldn't begin to
make enough noise to drown the yells of
approval that emanated from those little
throats. He reÃembJed a Rip Van Winkle
more than the proverbial Santa Claus, but
the children didn't mind that, they just
stood on their chairs clapping their hands
and screeching with delight They made
such a noise that the combined efforts of
the Sisters to quiet them had no effect.
They were too happy to heed any one, so
they just cheered and cheered until they
grew tired, and then they let Santa Claus
have a chance. He made tnem a neat iit
tle speech and then they were real quiet
fora minute, but when the Christmas tree
was brought on nnd the children caught a
glimpse of it another howl of delight
went up.
Then came the supreme moment for
those iittle children. They were marched
upon the stage and each little girl pre
sented with a doll; and such pretty dolis!
There were blonde dolls and brunette
dolls and girl and boy dolls, all dressed in
the height of fashion. And each little
girl was us proud of her doll as a mother of
her first born. For many of them it was
the first doll, in fact, the firsT; play toy
they had ever hud, and it was a pity that
the dolls could not appreciate the tender
ness bestowed upon them.
The boys received trumpets and imme
diately proceeded to make things lively,
as boys will. Each child received a box of
candy and the tree was weighted down
with picture-books and boxes of dishes.
Father Prendergasi, assisted by Fathers
Ramm and Dempsey, assisted in the dis
tribution of the gifts.

THE PRIDE OF
ST. IGNATIUS
Experts Deem the Organ of
That Church the Finest
on Earth.
The Gift of Mrs. Welsh, a
Wealthy and Benevolent
Parishioner.
Its Wonderful Musical Resources
and Splendid Mechanical
Accessories.
The parishioners of St. Ignatius Church
are the proud possessors of what is con
ceded by experts to be the finest organ in
the world. The finishing touches will be
put on it to-day, though already under
the apt manipulation of W. D. Woods,
assistant superintendent of the firm that
built the organ, its swelling notes of har
mony have startled into life the slum
bering echoes of the great cathedral.
The organ is the gift of Mrs. Welsh, an
opulent parishioner. A year ago last
June she presented the church with
$50,000, to be used in the construction and
erection of an instrument of suitable size
for the building, the Dalance to be placed
in a reserve fund for the maintenance of a
choir. The organ alone cost $30,000.
There are four manuals of sixty-one
notes each and a pedal of thirty notes. In
addition there are eighty-six stops, includ
ing the preparation for an altar organ.
The number of pipes reach the stupen
dous aggregate of over 5000. The key
board, or console, is placed a few feet in
front of the organ-case. The entire organ
is electro-pneumatic, and within this con
sole are placetl the electro^contact, pneu
matic piston-knobs for making the various
adjustable combinations.
From the lower gallery the organ towers
upward for 37 feet and 6 inches. It is 33
teet in width and 18 in depth. The case is
of selected white ash, finished in natural
color, and the front pipes are ornamented
in gold and colors. On the top columns
of the case are two lite-sized angels; of
course, in accordance with the ideas of
man upon tne sze of angels, which Super
intendent Woods himself admits are not
entirely authentic.
The wind supply is furnished with six
sets of bellows, operated by two electric
motors, one of live and the other of two
and a half horsepower. The bellows plant
is situated in the lower room at the left of
the organ, and the air is conveyed forty
feet to the electric receivers in the organ.
The organ weighs ovr r 100,000 pounds.
The intention was to inaugurate the use
of the instrument with a grand organ re
cital by Clarence Eddy, the rpnowned
organist of Chicago, and he was engaged
for the occasion, his arrival being expected
to-day. But a few days ago it was discov
ered that while there is nothing in Jesu
itical law conflicting witti this proceeding
it would be in direct violation of the dio
cesan rules to give a paid entertainment
in the church. Consequently the project
bad to be abandoned.
This is regretted for several reasons, as
Eddy is generally regarded as one of the
greatest living American organists and
the instrument in question is certainly
worthy of his skill. However, it is hoped
that some arrangement can yet be made
by which the public will be enabled to
hear the great instrument respond to
Eddy's touch. This will probably be on
Christmas day, when it will first be
formally used in the church services.
THEEE WERE GENUINE.
Dr. Spencer Keports on Diphtheria
Cases That Were Submitted
to Him.
Dr. Spencer, the bacteriologist of the
Board ot Health, sent in a report \ ester
day on suspected cases of diphtheria that
had been reported to him.
Out of a dozen or more cases submitted
tnree showed unmistakable evidences of
being eenuine. They were located as fol
lows: 315 Shotwell street, Pennsylvania
avenue, near Twenty-third street, and an
indigent who was sent to the City and
County Hospital.
These make forty-three cases for the
first naif of December, against forty-seven
cases fcr the whole of November.
Christmas High Jinka.
Commodore Harry M. Glllig of the Larch
mont Yacht Club, Will Barton, composer of
popular scores, and Frank linger are expected
to arrive in this City from New York next
Saturday. They will attend the Christmas
high jinks of the Bohemian Club. Charles
Leonard of Glenn County came in last even
lug, and other old-time members of ..the club
wlil pay their respects to the owl during the
holiday season.
KEff TO-DAT.
Old Rip Van Winkle went up into the
Catskill mountains to take a little nap
of twenty years or so, and when he
wakened, he found that the "cruel war
was over," the monthly magazines had
4 ' fought it over the second time and
"blown up" all the officers that had
participated in it. This much is history,
and it is also an historical fact that, dur-
ing the same length of time, Dr. Pierces
Golden Medical Discovery had become
the most celebrated, as it is the most ef-
fective, Iviver, Blood and Lung Remedy
of the age. In purifying the blood and
in all manner of pimples, blotches, erup-
tions, and other skin and scalp diseases,
scrofulous sores and swellings, and
kindred ailments, the "Golden Medical
Discovery" manifests the most positive
curative properties.
Every disorder that can be reached
through the blood, yields to its purifying
qualities. Besides, it builds up whole-
some flesh and strength ; not merely fat
like filthy Cod liver oil and its nasty
"emulsion's" but solid flesh.
A scrofulous condition of the blood in-
vites catarrh, bronchitis, and consump-
tion. We're all exposed to the germs of
consumption, grip and malaria â yet only
the weak ones suffer. When you're weak,
tired out, and debilitated, or when pim-
ples and blotches appear â heed the warn-
ing in time. The " Golden Medical Dis-
covery " sets all the organs into healthy
action â especially the liver, and that's
the point of entrance for these germs.
Then if the blood be pure, they'll be
thrown off. There's no risk.
