CONVENTION HAL,L. INDIANAPO
LIS, Ixd., Sept. 2-â The first day's session
of the National Democratic Convention,
called by the Democratic advocates of
sound money and the opponents of the
Cnicaeo platform, was marsed by unani
mous action and favorable surroundings
of wind, weather ana enthusiasm. Eight
hundred and twenty-four delegates were
present out of a possible 900. These rep
resented forty-one States and three Terri
tories. In maay instances the delegates
were supplemented by full sets of alter
nates, so that the attendance equaled and
almost surpassed the seating capacity of
the hali.
As a body the delegates presented the
appearance of substantial business men â
â weii dresieU, well mannered and exceed
ingly courteous â some oi them so unac
customed to the ways of political conven
tions tbat they had to be instructed as to
the simplest matters of procedure.
To leaven this iump of political inno
cence there was quite a sufficient admix
ture of veteran politicians, o.d wheel
horses of the Democracy in fact, including
three United States Senators â Paimer,
Caffery and Vila? â four or five Govemers
and ex-Goveriiors of Stats â Jones of Ala
bama, Stockbridaa of Delaware. Buckner
of Kentucky and Flower or New York â be
-everai prominent ex-Congressmen,
among them G. E. Everett of Massachu
setts and Perry Belmon; of New York.
The convention went to work with busi
ness celerity, effected both a temporary
and permanent organization, and got
down in one day to that important point
in its order of business where its platform
comes in. Senator Palmer of liiinois,
chairman of the committee which issued
the caU, rapped the convention to order.
Ei Governor Flower was made temporary
chairman, and read a very long address,
many points of which were cheered. He
was succeede-1 by Senator Caffery of
Louisiana," whose speech was much shorter

Convention, Begun at Indianapolis Yesterday.
than the temporary chairman's, but was
equally inc.Â«ive.
The oratorical effects of the day were
secured by Dr. G. E. Everett of Massachu
setts and John P. Irish of California. Dr.
Everett boidly declared that Massachu
setts was for cold ami not for bimetallism
â .ernational agreement, asserting that
every nation whose views were worth
having nad adopted the cold standard.
He al-o repudiated any alliance witn the
McKinley protectionists and proclaimed
â¢regularity" for the present convention,
which he beiieved wonld be the precursor
of a long line of regular Democratic con
ventions. The Chicago convention and
platform were ignore! as Democratic in
-â¢itutions by l:.e speakers and by the con
vention.
Mr. Ir.sh was very aggressive in his re
marks. He spoke of McKinley's protec
tion and Bryan's free-silver Popuiism as
"twin sisters" of the horseleech," working
in concert, each to produce a depression
of price? for which free trade or iree silver
was to be the remedy. He opposed the
income tax and called upon all true Demo
crats to protect tbe United States Supreme
from the degradation which would
be thrust upon it by tbe "puppet of tne
silver syndicate."
The San Francisco Call
All these remarks were vigorously
cheered, yet the most noticeable feature of
the day was the reception which met Mr.
Cleveland's name. Whenever it was men
tioned it was greeted with an uprising
demonstration of applause, the heartiness
and sincerity of which seemed beyond
qnestion.
The convention was called to order in
Tomlinson Hall. The interior of the
build; n* was profusely decorated with the
National colors and various designs em
b.ematic of the sound-money faith- The
front portion of the stage was furnished
with plants in pots â the goidenrod being
predominant. The main body of the hall,
on three sides of which are galleries for
spectators, was occupied by delegates. A
band of music in a smaller gallery dis
pensed popular airs durins the day.
Han. iag high over the platform was
the National coat-of-arms, on which a
golden eagle appeared to be triumpnantiy
napping vis wings. To the right of this
were hune framed likenesses of Jefferson,
Jackson and ex-Senator McDonald, and
to the left pictures of Cleveland, Hen
drick* and TUden. The appearance of
the hall, on the whole, was very pretty
and attractive.
There was much applause as prominent
Democrats entered the ball and took their
seats. AmoDir those t.us specially hon
ored were Buckner and Breckinridee of
Kentucky. Senator Palmer of liiinois
came :n unnoticed and took his seat
among the delegates from his State. A
white silk &&z on which was imprinted a
likeness of President Cleveland, with the
motto, "Florida's candidate," was carried
through the hall by a colored man, and
was cheered frequently. Ail the delegates
wore bright-colored badges on the lapels
of their coats, the prevailing hue being
golden yellow, and many of them sported
in addition twigs of "goldenroj," so that
the character of the convention was as
serted in unmistakable manner.
The convention was called to order at
12:30 o'clock by Senator John M. Palmer
of Illinois. He said:
"Gentlemen, I have the honor, mo
mentarily, to preside over the first Na
tional Democratic Convention heid in the
year 1*96. [Cheers.] The gavel wii! be in
my hands, however, but a moment.
are assembled here for hign, noble, patri
otic purposes. Our earnest thought :s to
serve our country [applause], and in the
sincerity of that purpose we may appeal
to the Judge ot all hearts. In order that
we may now appeal to the Great Master,
the Great Giver, I beg you to listen to the
invocation of Bishop White of the diocese
of Indiana."
Bishop White delivered an earnest in
vocation that the Almighty womd give us
grace seriously to lay to heart the great
danger the Nation is in by our unhappy
divisions.
The call for the convention was then
read. When the name of Cleveland was
mentioned in connection with the names
of Jefferson and Jackson the members uf
the convention rose and cheered for sev
eral minu:e-.
The roll of States was read with several
amusing incidents. When Colorado was
caiied the response was "Present, with a
solid de egation of one."
Florida aaid, "A double delegation and
overflowing."
Illinois replied, "A full delegation and
some to spare."
When Nevada was called there was no
direct response, but a voice from the rear
of tne bal. shouted, "Digging silver."
There was no answer from Wyoming.
When the call of States was finished
some one called for the Territories.
Alaska. Arizona and New Mexico were
found to be represented.
Senator Palmer then called for a report
from the National Committee, which was
read by Mr. Brennan of Wisconsin. It
declared that delegates have been se
i lected and are present from forty-one
| States. Those in w-ich no delegates have
| been se.ected are Wyoming, Utah, Idaho
and Neva : a.
In justice to the true Democracy of
! those States it should be stated that they
| are so far distant from the headquarters of
j tbe executive commif.ee that they are not
available for correspondence, and organi
zation ha* been relatively so short and the
population of said States so widely scat
tered that it has been impossible to take
the nece-sary steps to form local organiza
tions and to secure tbe election of dele
j gates to thi* convention. Democrats of
tbe true faith in these States doubtless
regret the absence of representatives in
this convention as deeply as can the con
vention.
Although Territories are not mentioned
in the call for this convention, ibe Dem
ocracy of the Territories of Alaska, Ari
zona and New Mexico have gallantly sent
; delegations. We recommend that thedel
j gates reported to ihe secretary shall be
entitled to participate in the preliminary
organization of the convention and that

] for those absent, if any, shall be entitled

to cast his full number of votes to which
their respective States are entitled. It
was also recommended that the rules of
the Democratic convention of 1892 shall
govern this convention. Ex-Governor
Flower was nominated for temporary
chairman.
Ex-Governor Flower was then conducted
to tde chair and said, in substance:
This gathering is notice to the world that
the Democratic party has not yet surrendered
to Populism and anarchy. The true principles
oi Democracy expounded by Jefferson and ex
j emplified through a century of National his
j tory, are not dead because those principles
; have been repudiated by a convention calling
j itself Democratic, but controlled by un
j Democratic influences. Those are true Demo
crats who remain true to the principles of
their party and who refuse to be bound by
party declarations which betray party faita
ana threaten both party and country with
disaster.
By our presence here we emphasise the
genuine character of our Democracy and
demonstrate the patriotic nature of our parti
sanship.
Because I love my party and my country I
am here to do what 1 can to shield them from
dangerous attack. The danger of the Chicago
I platform does not alone nor chiefly lie in its
declaraUon for a financial policy which wonld
be ruinous. The danger lies in the revolution
ary influence which controlled the Chicago
convention and animated its platform.
Men may justly differ as to the best scheme
of National finance, and may debate their dif
| ferences without recrimination or without
j questioning the honesty of motives. But
i when men, led on by ambitious politicians,
their minds fired not by the example of Amer
ican patriots, but by that of radicals of the
French revolution, overturn party precedent*
and pack a convention to secure an effective
majjrtty, then by aid of that majority raise
the incendiary banner of the people
against the rich, attack the integrity of the
Supreme Court, threaten the subversion of
Mr. Bryan said : " This is a political campaign. It is developing more public speaking than any
campaign that we have had since the war/
National institutions and the direct perver
| sion of constitutional guarantees, incite disre-
I epect of law and authority, suggest and in
E substance recommend the repudiation of Na
tional and private debts, and reject by intend
ed implication tbe fundamental principle of
Democracy that that government governs best
which governs least â then it is time not only
for Democrats to forsake that motley and un-
American gathering, to reject that nn-Dvmo
cratic and un-American enunciation of doc
trines, and to join, in such manner as may
seem oest, with all patriots who cherish their
country's honor and wish to protect the wel
fare of its peop'.e.
I mistake the moral sense of the American
people if the action of the Populists at Chicago,
reinforced and emphasized by the action of the
Populists at Si. Louis, haa not rekindled the
spirit of American patriotism and awakened
tbe American conscience to the national dan
gers which lnrk in the forces and influences
behind Bryan *nd Seweil or Bryan and Wat
son. The real issue in this campaign is an is
sue of patriotism. In many a Presidential
election tas the fight raged fiercely be.ween
the advocates of different political doctrines
and the ruin of the country freely predicted il
either -â¢â et of doctrine* were established as the
policy of the Government â such predictions
being merely the extreme expression of party
politics; but in this election the issue an und
which the battle is waging involves the integ
rity of onr institutions and the sacredne-s of
our National honor, and when men have
stirred that deep well of sentiment, ordinary
party differences disappear, the moral i.-sue
predominates and all good citizens sta-d
Senator John M. Palmer of Illinois, One of the Organizers of the
National Democratic Party.
FOR ONCE WE AGREE WITH MR. BRYAN.
I shoulder to shoulder axalnst those who would
I de-troy toe Americin name and undermine the
walls of her political structure. Mr. Bryan re
iteretes, in about every Â«oad speech, that he
stands squarely on the Cn:cago platform and
rapports every one of its planks.
Jiit has not yet announced his accep'ance of
all the planks of the Populist platform, but
inasmuch as these are only different in degree
and he has been identified with Populism
quite as much as -xith Democracy, it is but
lair to assume tbat be stands on both plat
forms. Not quite so radical in his views, per
haps, as Altgeld or Tillman. not quite so
frank as Tom Watson, he is, nevertheless, a fit
representative of tbe revolutionary forces be
hind him â ambitious, unsteady and unsafe.
There is nothing in n is career or in his pres
ent utterances to encourage the hoi* that if
elected he wou d rise above his surroundings
or stay the hand which threatens to destroy
and pervert. An untried man, a demagogue,
a word juggler, he well represents the restless
mob from wn.ch be rose, and wiih character
istic recklessness does not hesitate to appeal to
base human passions in order to attract votes.
Tbat in this iÃcenaiary's role, standing as he
professes to stand, on principles as mi-Demo
cratic as those of H*rr Most, he should deserve,
by any co: ception of party regularity, tne
support oi uue Democrats, is past compre
hension and explainable on'y by .enorance of
the man and bis platform or disloyalty to
genuine party faith. No sound conception. of
party regularity'can justify encouragement to
social di-order.
Not even the honest believer in a silver
standard or the most enthusiastic bimetallism
can. if he be a patriotic citizen, conscientiously
support the forces of political inirthr. The
advocacy of free-silver coin ge by Bryan ana
many of his adherents is only a cloak for the
spirit of revolution behind. Every true bi
meta'list must blush to have his cause depend
ant for success upon those who would reorgan
ize the S a preme Court when its decisions do
not please a party convention, who would re
pudiate the National debt if free silver coinage
did not accomplish bimetallism, who would
attempt to destroy the sanctity of private con
tracts, who would have the Government take
and operate the country's railways and tele
graph, who would restrain the strong arm of
law in suppression of disorder. Even if 1
believed tbat free coinage of silver by the
I'm ted States independently and alone would,
under proper conditions, restore bimetallism,
I could not bring myself to intrust so delicate
and important an undertaking to men of Bry
an's inexperience and ass.>ciations,*nd I would
suffer forever the alleged evils of a gold stand
ard before I wonld be a party to contempt of
law, to as attack on our highest court and to
a subversion of our form of government by
loading it down with ungovernmentui func
tions. Before such a spectacle how would the
shadow of Jefferson, Jackson and Tilden shud
der and sarink.
Wnile. as 1 have aaid, Mr. Bryan boldly pro
fesses to stand on every one of the stranÂ«e
planks of the Chicago platform, he adroitly
attempts to divert Democratic attention from
the revolutionary spir.t which prevades most
o :^at document by confining the larger
part of his public utterances to what be calls
bimetallism, and he evidently hopes by mag
nifying the importance of this flnancia. lama
and distorting its phases so that it will ap
pear to be the movement oi the masses against
the classes, to make Democrats forget their
dislike oi the plainly un-DemocraUc features
of the platform and to persuade them that
after all on.y an economic issue is involved and
this snou'.d not justify a breaking of party ties.
But tbat kind of tactics should deceive no
one. We believe that Mr. Bry*n'Â» arguments
for free Silver are fallacious and demagogic,
but we oppose his candid- cy not ch.efly be
cause he favors free coinage, but because his
advocacy of that policy is but a feature of his
support of a set of doctrines which we have
been taught to regard as the very opposite of
Democratic and tbe support of which demon
strates the ;infitcess of Bryan and his associ
ates for positions of public trust. Let not this
fact escape Democratic attention.
Every appeal in the name of party regularity
to support the Bryan ticket is an appeal to
support '.he governmental ownership of rail
roads and telegraphs, to attack the independ
ence of the Federal judiciary, to abolish the
cr dii system as a test of fitness for pu<>;ic
office, to refuse to uphold toe National credit
by the issue of bond-* when necessary, to scale
down the pub.ic deb; by repudiation, to invite
not only me evil> which wou.d follow a silyer
standard, but those which would loiiow irre
deemable paper money, for even purely fiat
money seems to De recommended in the^Jhicago
p. at form. The men who represent such a con
glomeration of poor principles and radical no
tions are not Democrats. 1 hey have no claim
on Democrats, and all over tae land to-day
Democrats are rising to overthrow their party
fetters, which mean slavery, and to staud be
tween the people and .he certain injury which
thÂ« party* rash leaders would inflict upon the
Nation.
"'- THe", revolutionary spirit which forced Bry
an's nomination is manifest In his speeches
now being delivered throughout the Country.
His conspicuous failure at Madison-square Gar
den to advance the cause of silver by close ar
gument -, has , induced . him ;to abandon ' â  the
weapons of tbe logician and statesman and to
empioy the arts of the orator. From the rear
end of cars he has been flinging out social and
political firebrands among the people.
â  He appeals to the base instincts of the ignor
ant or to the' misery ot the distressed. He
strives to, array, class against class, to incite
employe against employer, to stir up debtor
against creditor, to make this a contest of the
poor against the rich. Mar God prevent this
incendiary work! In this broad land it has
luian nsrumid t haJt Â«h*Â»MnnÂ«io( mik
cess have been open to all. The rich to-day
were the poor of yesterday. No families of in
herited wealth dominate our politics or our
society.
Before the law all men are equal. The same
opportunities do not come to all men; some
succeed, many fail, but no barrier to success or
position is created by law. Industrial condi
tions may be affected by unwise laws, and
when this is demonstrated we attempt to
change them through the opportunity which
every man has to register his vote at the polls.
But though some men succeed and many fail,
this is the lot of life, and no candidate for the
Presidency has ever dared before to use thu
fact to arouse men against men and to kindle
the fires of social discontent and disorder.
Proud as we have been of America's mate
terial prosperity, we have been prouder sti'l
of the self-reliant, independent and sensbUe
spirit of her peopla. When foreign critics
have toid us democracy here would some
day prove a failure, that universal suf
frage would lead to anarchy, that class feeling
would be engendered which would result in
riot or in the confiscation of property, we
have laughed and have pointed to the sturdy
Americanism on our iarnva. to the influences
of our public schools, to the respect for law
and order in our cities, to the examples of
se.f-made men in every f mily, to the educat
ing influenses ot our press, to the fullness aDd
broadness of our charities, and more than all,
to tne solid patriotism of our people. I be
lieve that we can still depend upon these.
Bad as the times are, stagnant as industry is,
distressed as many homes are ior lack of em
ployment, the common-sense or the American
people will not be deceived by appeals to pas
sion, but will perceive clearly -what is truth,
namely, tbat the present conditions are largely
caused, not by tbe influences against which
Mr. Bryan in lurid words disclaims, but Dy
fear of the very remedies which he suggests.
When this great sr.adow which he and his
associates have created passes off tne surface
of the financial and industrial world, then
confidence will be restored, money will seek
i:. vestment, factories will be reopened and
employment be secured. There can be no
prosperity without confidence, and Mr. Bry
an's plan shatters confidence and portends
business failures and panic These mean more
men out of employment, more homes without
fcod and clothing, more misery and distress.
A.I of Mr. Bryan's speeches, pleas and argu
ments for silver are based on the assumption
thai the free coinage of silver by the United
States a one >'ovid estab.isa and maintain bi
metallismâthe parity of gold and silver at the
exchangeable raiio of 16 to 1. If that assump
tion is incorrect or ill founded each of his ar
guments falls to the ground, and every one of
his predictions loses its force. Not o:.e word
has he uttered in advocacy of a silver stand
ard ; not one word does he dare in behalf of a
silver standard.
Hf will declaim by the boar against the
erils of gold monometallism. and nearly every
thing he says on that sjbjec; is equally appli
cable to Â«ilver monometallism al.-o. Bimetal
lism is a genuine Democrat c dec trine, but
bimetallism can never be attained by the men
who dominated the Chicago convention or by
the method implied in the Chicago platform.
There is reason to donbt whether the forces
wh.ch controlled that convention even de
sired to accomplish bimetallism. The word
bimetallism does not appear in the platform.
The convention by an overwhelming vote re
jected a proposition pledging the Government
to maintain the parity of the two metals. The
disposition of the convention, as dictated by
its expressions and its actions, was toward
silver monometallism or irredeemable fiat
money. As well might the ark of the covenant
have Deen entrusted to tee Philistines as to
entrust the cause of bimetallism to the revo
lutionary people behind Bryan.
It is not a difficult task to show that under
present conditions free cotnsge of silver by
the United States alone would result in silver
monometallism. Foolish experiments In that
direction have already caused the loss of a
great part 01 our eoid from circulation. Part
of it has gone abroad, withdrawn from invest

Assessor Dalton's Explanation Not
Satisfactory â Beamer Expresses
an Opinion.
Sacramento, Cal., sept. 2.â From
all appearances the Board of Supervisors
intend to totally ignore the existence ol
the State Board of Equalization in as fax
as coming before that body to explain
why in proportion to taxable wealth City
property is assessed at a lower basis thaa
is that of agricultural counties of the
State. On the original date set by the
board for hearing the arguments if the
representatives of San Francisco County
the equalizer* received a petition asking
for further lime, and in granting this they
did so with the expectation of a battle
royal. In consequence they have been
laying in a supply of ammunition. But
to-day San Francisco failed to put in an
appearance and all the gathered data wag
as naught.
Perhaps the reception accorded Assessor
Daiton of Alameda County last weelc
dampened the ardor of the San Francisco
Board of Supervisors; at all events the
equalizers met an Arctic irost instead of a
torrid heat.
San Francisco and Alameda counties are
not assessed for more than 50 per cent of
their true values, declare Equalizers More
house and Beamer. There are entire aia
.tricts within the Bay City which are not
assessed for anywhere near the face value
of the mortgages they carry, and capital is
not so easily misled that it will advance
itself for anything like the true monetary
valuation of property. Speaking more
fully on the subject Equalizer Beamer
said:
"The agricultural counties of this Stata
are assessed much higher in proportion
to their real vaiue than are the counties
of San Francisco and Alameda. Tha
assessment of Henry P. Daiton in Ala
meda County is at least 20 per cent below
the figures furnished from forty agricul
tural counties.
"All property in Alameda County is as
sessed low in proportion to its real yalue,
excepting some farming property in sec
tion ? where the land is not valuable and
productive. We have abundant evidence
to prove this. Property-owners in differ
ent counties have voluntarily come before
the State Board cf Equalization and testi
fied tbat they could not pay the tax s on
their farming property were it noi that
they owned property in Alameda County.
I am confident that Mr. Daiton knows he
has not assessed Alameda County at its
value. His assessment is unquestionably
popular with the mass of property-owners
in his county, because of it they avoid the
payment of their share of State taxes. In
about nine cases out of ten Mr. Daiton has
cat down the value of improvements and
I cannot see why this should have beea
done, except to popularize Mr. Daiton
witn those by means of whose votes he
expects to be retained in office.
"I am informed tf.at prior to his elec
tion Mr. Daiton promised the taxpayers
that if elected he would reduce their taxes
25 per cent. He made his campaign in a
buggy placarded with this announcement
and as far as he could do it he has kept
his promise. But that promise was kept
at the expense of every taxpayer of this
State outside of Alameda County and Mr.
Daiton's assessment should not be allowed
to stand. I have annually examined the
asaessment-roli of Aiameda County for
several years and have always thought it
was low, and yet Mr. Daiton makes a cut
on valuable improvements that cannot be
characterized in any other terms than as
ridiculous."
It is claimed, however, that Equalizer
Chesebrough, whom property interests aJI
lie in San Francisco, does not fully accord
with bis associates. But the outlook is
that the assessment of Aiameda and San
Francisco counties will be accorded a hori
zontal raise teat will piace them on an
- quality, in proportion to their taxable
properties, with other agricultural coun
ties of the State, as the equalizers view
the situation.

TOLEDO, Ohio, Sept. 2.â When the
train bearing Mr. Bryan arrived at Spring
field the crush from the steps of the car to
the platform was simply terrible, 20,000
people being present. Mr. Bryan spoke
as follows:
Ladies and gentlemenâ For a few moments
only 1 shall occupy your attention, because a
lÃrge portion of my voice has been left along
tae line of travel, where it is still calling sin
ners to repentance. I am told that in this
city you manufacture more agricultural Imple
ments than are manufactured in any other
tity of the country.
lam glad to talk to you, who recognize that
the dollars which you received are earned by
those who convert the natural resources of
this country into money, those who till the
Boil, for from its fertility springs this Nation's
primary greatness. Upon the prosperity of the
great producers of wealth, whom we call the
masses, as distinguished from the classes, de
pends all the prosperity of this city.
If you have a gold standard you legislate
the value of money up and you legislate the
value oi property down.
The very legislation that increases the pur
chasing power of n dollar simply enables that
dollar to buy more of other things. How can
a dollar be made to buy more of other things?
By making more wheat sell lor a dollar, more
corn for a dollar, mo-e oats sell for a dollar,
more potatoes sell for a dollar, more of the
product of toil exchanging for a given amount
of money. It is a good thing for the man who
owns money and buys property, but it is a
mighty bad thing for the man who has to pay
money with tae property that he produces.
[Applause.]
How does the gold standard affect you? You
make your implements and sell them to the
farmer. Suppose the farmer finds his taxes
don't go down, but the price of all that he
bells goes down. What does it mean? It
means that he has less and less money to
t spend on agricultural implements and the
â Qpport of his family. [Cheers.] If you sell
his agricultural implements he promises to
â pay you and the legislation destroys his ability
to pay, then you Hud fault because you have
to take your implements back and sell them
second hand to somebody else.

A large number of men, women, boys
and girls, bearing slips of yeilow paper
containing the inscription, "McKinley
Club," were in the crowd of several hun
dred gathered at .Belie Fontaine. Al
tnouph the Bryant contingent, in the dis
tance seemed to be in the minority, it
had plenty of enthusiasm and succeeded
in making a great noise. Mr. Bryan re
ferred to the color of the badges in his
Epeecb.
Farmers from the surrounding country
lcept coming into Kenton all the morning
to attend the reception given there to W.
J. Bryan, and when ne arrived the demon
stration was most enthusiastic.
Mr. Bryati made a vigorous speech at
the courthouse square that won irequent
applause. While it was in progress part of
the speakers' stand gave way with a crash,
carrying a score of people with it. No
body was hurt, but the wildest excitement
reigned for a few minutes. Mrs. Bryan
barely managed to save herself irom being
precipitated into the hole through whicu
tnose near her fell.
A special coach, charisred by the Toledo
reception committee, was attached to the
train on which Mr. Bryan left Kenton.
Mr. Bryan was given a nattering reception
in point of the number of people who as
sembled to hear him speak at Findlay.
If the crowd was not so enthusiastic as
at other places there were plenty who did
honor to the full extent of their lungs.
Fully 8000 people were present.
After leaving Findlay stops were made
by trie Bryan train at Walker and Cynet,
where there were small crowds but much
enthus-iasm. Mr. Bryan made brief re
marks at both places.
At Bowling Green a stand had been
erected a hundred feet from the railway
tracks and about it 2000 people were closely
packed. They cheered the candidate when
lie appeared and listened attentively to a
brief speech.
The Ladies' Silver Club, composed of
young women attired in white frocks and
wearing silvered caps, was a feature of the
reception there, and a brass band had also
been retained to meet the candidate. Miss
Carrie Layman, a member of the Ladies'
Silver Club, presented Mr. Bryan with a
bouqet of flowers and made a little ad
dress.
"These flower?," she said, "were gath
ered from the richest agricultural soil in
this great State, where the people, and
especially t lie farmer, notwithstanding
their splendid soil, are in great financial
distress."
Another vast audience, unprecedented
in political campaigns, beard William J.
Bryan deliver a speech in High School
Square, here to-night. The concourse at
Columbus last night was the largest Mr.
Bryan ever addressed.

FORMULATING RESOLUTIONS.
Preparing the Planks for the Sound-
Money Platform.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Sept. 2.â The
committee on resolutions met at the Grand
Hotel shortly before 5 o'clock and organ
ized by selecting Senator Vilas of Wiscon
sin chairman and Albert Watkins of Ne
braska secretary. It was deemed best to
leave the actual construction of the plat
form to a sub-committee, ana after an
hour of discussion the following were
selected to do this work : Hon. W. F.
Vilas (chairman), C. V. Holman of Maine,
C. P. Lewis of New Jersey, Hon. Virgil P.
Kline of Ohio. Comptroller of the Cur
rency James H. Eckels of Illinois, Ed
mund Cooper of Tennessee, Thomas G.
Jones of Alabama, John P. Irish of Cali
fornia, Henry W. Lamb of Massachusetts
and Albert Watkina of Nebraska.
The informal discussion of the members
disclosed the fact that the great majority
of the committee was of one mind on the
leading propositions to De submitted. It
is understood that there will be no refer
ence to bimetallism, but that the money
plank will declare unequivocally for the
existing single gold standard. Alone this
line the plank submitted by C. E. S, Wood
of Oregon, heretofore given in these dis
patches, appears to have met with een
eral approval, for its reading was greeted
with applause. While it is probabie that
the declaration will be put in a different
dress the ideas advanced will likely form
the basis of the financial plank. That pro
posed plank is as follows :
We favor the use of gold and silver as
money, but insist upon the maintenance of
our present gold standard and that silver
should only be used so far he it safely may be
and consistently with the firm maintenance
of such gold standard.
We oppose all iorms of flat money and con
sider its retirement from circulation as rec
ommended by the present administration in
dispensible to a stable currency and to the
maintenance of the gold standard.
The retirement of the greenback has
many strone advocates, among them Virgil
Kline of Ohio and Perry Belmont of New
York.
Equitable and just pension laws will be
indorsed.
The tariff plank will be along the usual
lines. A vigorous opposition will De ex
pressed to all forms of fraudulent and mis
guided paternalism.
The Chicago platform will be arraigned,
notably on account of its "attacks on the
Supreme Court" and its "upholding of
anarchy by denying the right of the use
of Federal troops in a State to suppress
the violations of the United States law in
those States."
Among tho propositions offered and
read lor the information of the committee
was one by C. Vey Uoiman of Maine re
garding the merchant marine. It was,
he said, radically different from the plank
pressed upon the committees of the St.
Louis and Chicago conventions â and
adopted by the latter â by the representa
tive* of the American Shipping League, of
which Arthur Sewall is president. It reads
as follows:
We demand that henceforth modern and
liberal policies toward American shipping
'shall take the place of our imitation of the re
strictive statute* ot the eighteenth century,
long ago abandoned by every other maritime
power but the United Slates. To this end we
lavor the repeal of those navigation laws
which, to the Nation's humiliation, have
driven American capital and enterprise to the
use of alien flags and alien crews, have made
the Stars and Stripes an almost unknown em
blem in foreign ports, and have virtually ex
tinguished the race of American seamen.
We oppose me pretense that discriminating
duties will cromote shipping: that scheme is
an Invitation to commercial warfare upon the
United States, un-American in the light of our
great commercial treaties, offering no gain
whatever to American shipping while greatly
increasing ocean freights on our agricultural
and manufacturing products.
The sub-commiitee to-night becan tne
work of drafting a platform, a task which
Senator Vilas said should be well and
thoroughly performed, regardiess of the
time required to do it. The sub-committee
reviewed the propositions before them
and decided that more satisfactory
proeress could be made by a further sub
division of labor, so the general divisions
of the platform were assigned to the fol
lowing named members for preparation:
Preamble and general declarations, Kline.
Curtis and Jones; financial plank. Vilas
and Eckels: tariff and economic subjects
Irish, Watkins and Holman; civil service'
Lamb.

JAPAN AGAIN CONVULSED,
An Earthquake Destroys One
Town and Badly Damages
Others.
Many Persons Reported Xi led and
Injuredâ A Typhoon in the
Southern Prov noes.
YOKOHAMA, Japan, Sept. 2.â Reports
have been received here to the effect that
a severe earthquake caused a great amount
of damage Monday in the northwest
provinces and on the main islands off that
coast.
Particulars are very meager, but it is
known that the town of Rufcago has been
partially destroyed and other villages
severely damaged. Many persons are re
ported to have been killed and injured,
and the property loss is believed to be tre
mendous.
The provinces visited by the earthquake
are the same as those devastated by the
terrible eartnquake and tiual wave of
June 15, when a large number of towns
were wiped out and the estimated loss of
life was 30,000.
The provinces of Rekuzen and RiKnchu,
alone the coast from the island of Kon
kasan northward, are where the principal
sufferers are to-day.
The recollection of the havoc to human
life wrought by the convulsion causes
great anxiety as to what further reports
may show as the result of Monday's earth
quake.
On the same day a typhoon caused ex
tensive damage in Southern Japan.
West Woolwich, Me., is perhaps unique
in not having a dog within the village
limits. 6
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 3, 1896.
Interior of Tomlinson Hall, Indianapolis, Indiana, Where the Gold Standard Democracy Is
Holding Its National Convention. Scene as Viewed From the Stage.
GOLDENROD
DEMOCRACY
I Continued from First Page. I
merit in our industries, and part has been
hoarded for the day when it should bring a
high premium. Our Government can get
none except by increasing the National debt
and the burden of taxation. About $100,000,
-000 in gold is in the United States treasury to
support the parity, not alone of the $346,000,
-000 of greet. backs, which was its original
function, but the $625,000,000 of silver cur
rency which has been issued since. That frail
foundation has been trembling since 1890
with the additional weight put upon It. Only
by heroic means has the Government been
able to prop up the immense superstructure.
But even the prospect of unlimited silver coin
age under present conditions would make
that foundation disappear as if jn a quick
sand, and you and I and every man who has
property or wages would find their value
changed from a gold to a silver measure.
This will be the certain result of imposing
such an additional burden upon the Govern
mem, but when with that in view we consider
the disposition of foreign Governments to
strengthen their gold reserves end the sus- J
pension of free silver coinage in India, which |
has heretofore been the world's sink for all its
surplus silver, but it is so no longer, the con
clusion is inevitable that we would be reduced
to a silver basis and to a very cheap silver
basis at that.
One characteristic of political remedies ad
ministered and recommended by quack po
litical doctors is that they are alleged to cure
all diseases. To every man in distress in any
part of the country the demonetization of sil
ver is pointed out as the cause of his misery,
and the remonetization of silver as his remedy.
By reason of perfectly simple causes the
prices of wheat and corn and other agri
cultural products have declined, but this de
cline is attributed by these political quacVs to
the demonetization of silver, and the farmer,
along with every other man who finds it hard
to make both ends meet, is told that by re
monetizing silver wheat will go to a dollar a
bushel and other farm products will rise pro
portionately.
If this were true, rising prices would affect
the commodities which a farmer buys, the
interest he pays on his debts, the freight rates
which determine the cost of getting his pro
ducts to market, and he would be relatively
no better off than before. To expect the
farmer to accept so great a delusion is to pre
sume upon his intelligence. Ask the farmers
of my State why they are giving up the pro
duction of wheat and corn, and they will tell
you it is because of the depreciation of 6ilver.
They will point to these great Western prairies
and tell you they cannot compete with these
in the growth of the staple cereals. And they
have taken to raising other crops which are
more profitable and less competitive. The
same tendency 13 the ense throughout the
agricultural world. Not only have thousands
of acres of Western lands in America been
thrown open to cultivation within recent
years, but in Russia, India and the Argentine
Republics, railroads and enterprises have
brought large additions of acreage under cul
tivation and poured millions of additional
bushels upon the markets of the world.
The same cheapening in the cost of boots
and shoes, of hats and coats and other cloth-
Ing which has followed excessive production
in the manufacture of these articles, has been
manifest in the excessive production of agri
cultural products. It is the old familiar law
of supply and demand. In my State of New
York hay is selling at $15 per ton ; last year it
was $10. Do our 6ilver friends attribute that
to the demonetization of silver? They ought
to if they wish to be consistent. Silver dollars
In the pockets of the nine-owners are of no
benefit to the Western farmer. What they
want is prosperous conditions which will put
silver dollars in their own pocketsâ dollars
which when they are taken out will buy just as
much as gold dollars.
Against such threatened calamities we have
met as Democrats, as patriots, to protest. Our
purpose is too serious to permit differences on
minor matters or personal jealousies to divide
our councils or weaken our Influence.
We have come here as Democrats to exert
such influences as we may have among Demo
crats for the good of our country and the pres
ervation of our party organization for other
periods of usefulness. Renouncing as un-Dem
ocratic the work of the party organizational
Chicago let us be true to every Democratic in
stinct at Indianapolis. Let no man say that in
this convention any falso note of Democracy
was sounded. We stand for all that should in
spire good citizenship, for honest money, en
forcement of law and order, respect for author
ity, the preservation of the National credit,
the just paymeut of debts, tLe dignity and
welfare of labor, the prosperity and fair name
of America. United in such a cause we can go
forward with the American flag as our banner
and the words "National Democrats" inscribed
on its folds. We know no sectional Issue or in
terest. We stand behind the broad shield of
patriotism, and in that sign we shall conquer.
The speech was very warmly received.
The States were tnen called for the selec
tion of members of the various committees
and at 2:10 p. M. the convention tooc a
recess until 4 p. m. During the interim the
committee on permanent organization
carried out the programme of the National
committee by selecting Senator Caffery of
Louisiana for permanent chairman. John
K. Wilson of Indiana, the temporary sec
retary, and the remainder of the tempo
rary organization were chosen for perma
nent officers.
The convention reassembled at 4:30 with
a very large attendance. Tha report of
the committee on credentials stated that
there were 824 delegates d resent, repre
senting forty-one States and three Terri
tories, and recommending that those pres
ent he entitled to cast the f nil votes of
their States and Territories. The report
was agreed to without question.
Dr. Everett of Massachusetts was intro
duced to fill up with a speech the time
until the report on permanent organiza
tion should be ready. He addressed the
convention as feliow-patriots, and said
Massachusetts had sent her delegation,
nearly sixty strong, to aid in repelling the
invasion which had risen against the
ancient honor and credit of the whole
country. [Cheers.] Massachusetts was
for gold. [Choers.] Talk about an inter
national agreement for bimetallism ! Why
had we not now all the nations of the
world whose name was worth anything
for the gold standard? [Applause.]
Massachusetts, he continued, is here
against all class distinctions. [Cheers.]
Massachusetts Democracy knows no dis
tinction between North and South, be
tween East and West [applause], and,
above all, the Democracy of our State will
not stand any insult against that man
who has protected the credit and honor of
America. We stand to-night with Presi
dent Cleveland.
Here the convention rose to a man, and
there was a scene of great enthusiasm.
Delegates cheered and shouted, and waved
hats, fans, handkerchiefs andnags.and the
spectators in the galleries took part in the
demonstration.
When Dr. Everett was able to make him
self heard again, he said : We of Massa
chusetts are not here to act for any special
candidates. Gentlemen from the South
and West, gentlemen from the Pacific and
center, give us any two men, any men
the country knows and honors for
distinction, for purity, for worth in public
or private life, North or South, civilians
or soluieis, and Massachusetts will do all
that she can for their support. [Prolonged
applause.]
"We are told that we might do as well
by casting our votes for the candidates
nominated at St. Louis. I mean the first
St. Louis convention, not the second.
[Laughter.] We are told that for sound
money's sake we have nothing to do but
to go over to that camp. Mr. President, I
respectfully decline to admit that all rjub
lic virtue is centered in the Republican
party. [Applause.] If it were only for
this year, if it were only for this campaiern,
I might think differently of what we are
to do. But we are not here only for this
campaign. We are here for 1900, we are
here for the future. There are hundreds
and thousands of young men growing up
and asking for whom they are to vote and
who know nothing of the traditions of
party. They want to know to what party to
join themselves, to know which is the
progressive party, the party of the day
and hour, and I say this convention is to
be not the last, but the first of a series of
conventions. [Loud applause.]
"This is to be the first convention of the
party of young America. [Cheers.] We
are fighting not merely for the honor and
historic principles of our party; not merely
against anarchism and populism; not
merely against protection and paternal
ism, but we are fighting that the United
States may stand in tne face of her sister
nations, undimmed in honor and un
shaken in courage."
Dr. Everett resumed bis seat amid loud
and long continued applause.
The report of the committee on perma
nent orgnnization was then presented by
{ the chairman of the committee, James W.
I Eaton of New \'ork. Senator Caffery was
I escorted to the chair by Mr. Bullitt of
Pennsylvania and Mr. Lawler of Minne
sota, and spoke as follows:
I tender this convention my deepest thanks
for the nonor conferred by selecting me to
I preside over us deliberations. I shall always
j regard it &s the highest evÂ«r conferred
upon me.
Charged by our party with the function of
ministering in its temple of faith and teaching
the people its true doctrines, our priests have
desecrated its altars, broken its shrines and
taught false doctrines to tho people. We now
enter the sanctuary of the temple and take
possession of the ark of the covenant of our
faith, which we will hereafter vigilantly
j guard, protect and defend. We will purify its
i desecrated altars and rebuild its broken
shrines. And, lest the hearts of the people be
stolen away from true Democratic faith, the
faith of our fathers and founders, we must
separate from our brethren who have wrought j
this evil, and from those who have followed
their evil teaching. "We cannot follow them
in the road they have taken; for their feet are
swift to destruction and their way is the way
of death.
The ties that bound us were as strong as
hooks of steel, but we part from them, though
in sorrow. Loyalty to party discipline and
to organization has ever been the pride and
strength of our party. Loyalty to principle
has ever been and ever will be its cardinal and
leading tenet, paramount to all others, bind
ing in conscience and guiding the action of
every true Democrat.
The Chicago platform has the stamp of our
party and claims its allegiance, but it is a mere
simulacrum, a form without the substance of
Democracy, and no Democrat is bound by it,
nor is it entitled to his fealty. The declara
tions of that platform are "open, palpable and
flagrant" departures from all that Democracy
has stood for. They assail the money standard
of the country and declare for the inflated and
depreciated standard of silver at 16 to 1.
They assail the right and power of the
executive to enforce the law and to
protect property undor the control and in
the custody of the Federal courts in any
state in the Union; they attack the integrity
of a co-ordinate branch of the Government;
they declare that the function of issuing paper
money is to be exclusively exercised by the
Government itself; they assuil the right of the
citizen to contract payment in any legitimate
commodity, for they declare that the obliga
tions of the Government for vhieh gold was
received, and for the payment of which in the
same coin the National faith is pledged, may
be paid in depreciated coin. And we declare
each and all of these attacKs aud declarations
are un- Democratic. They are an assault upon
the constitution, the time-honored principles
of the Democratic narty and the distinguished
patriot and statesman who has twice led it to
the only victories it has achieved in thirty-six
years.
It is the Ismael of platforms. It raises its
baud against Â»ome of the principles of both
parties and nearly all the principles of the
Democratic party. It is begotten of the un
hallowed union between so-called Democracy.
Populism and anarchy, snd that the Scriptures
may be fulfilled "it will be a fugitive aud a
wanderer on the face of the earth."
We hold that no argument is needed to show
the revolutionary and anarchistic character
of the doctrine that the laws can be en
forced in a State to protect property which is
in the jurisdiction of Federal courts, or to
protect the United Btates mails, or that the
Supreme Court ought to be reorganized, or
that the National honor should be stained, or
the National faith violated, or that the free
dom of private contract ought to be limited,
or that the function of issuing paper money
ought to be exclusively exercised by the Fed
eral Government. We hold that the theory of
free coinage of silver witn gold at the ratio of
16 to 1 admits of argument, but we hold that
the weight ot authority, the strength of reason
ing and the facts of history all point to its
fallacy and the ruinous consequences of its
adoption. We hold that it will rob the
poor man of his wage and the rich
man of his wealth, the widow of
her savings, the child of his patrimony, the
soldier of his pension, the Industrious of the
fruits ol his toil and the inventor of the re
ward of his genius. We hold that it will de
moralize and seriously disturb the immense
trade and commerce of the republic and drive
the country to a discredited, depreciated and
depreciating standard; smite our finances as
with palsy and trade with a blight. We hold
that the Nation's credit will fall prostrate; its
obligations will be dishonored and its unsul
lied character will be stained with fraud and
deficit. We claim that these averments are
true, established by historical fact, by unan
swerable reason, the opinions of the most dis
tinguished political economists and the com
mon-sense and common honesty of the largest
portion of our fellow-citizens.
The credulity and cupidity of some of our
good citizens have been played upon and
aroused by artful fantasies and cunning dema
gogues. There are, however, many honest,
patriotic and intelligent men who cling with
all the strength of conviction to the spacious
but unsound theory of bimetallism at 16 to 1.
If their theory is denounced as false and per
nicious no imputation is cast upon their char
acter nor any slur upon their intedigenne.
The free coinage of silver is, and has been
since Mr. Cleveland's inauguration, the su
preme overshadowing issue before the coun
try. Upon that issue the President and a ma
jority of his party took opposite sides. In con
sequence he has been powerless to effect finan
cial reform and secure immunity from gold
raiding on the treasury.
Since the inception of the struggle for free
silver no compromise has been possible. Our
brethren knew that the battle was on to the
death. The nominee of the so-called Demo
cratic party has on several occasions pro
claimed the irreconcilable nature of the con
flict. It is a fitting culmination for our
brethren to obtain allies from Populism at the
price of incorporating its nefarious doctrines
in their platform and attempting to pats them
off as genuine Democracy. It was fit that to a
degraded and depreciated currency should be
added an assassinated judiciary and a power
less executive.
Fellow-citizens, we are not traitors to our
party. We are in the house of our fathers. We
cannot be driven from it. We will defend the
honor of our country and the integrity of our
principles as long as life endures. We can
neither be ousted from our political heritage
nor forced into the ranks of our old-time ad
versary. We intend to preserve intact, unim
paired and unsullied, by and through the or
ganization which we perfect to-day, the De
mocracy of Jefferson, Jackson, Benton and
Cleveland. We propose to furnish a refuge
and an abiding place for such of our brethren
as, shocked aud grieved at the betrayal of our
principles at Chicago, are inclined to go to the
Republican camp.
The principles of Democracy are imperish
able. They are antagonistic to the paternal
ism of the Reuublican and the Socialist, the
destructiveness of the anarchist and the
vagaries of the inflationist repudiator. Byron
wrote: "While the Coliseum stands Rome
shall stand, and while Rome stands, the
world." We say: 'While Democracy stands
the Republic shall 6tand. and while the Re
public stands, human liberty." For a season
our party may stray after false doctrines and
flounder amid quagmires until the beacon
light of truth breaks upon it. It will rise from
every fall like Antaeus of old, and "E'en in
its ashes shall live its wonted fires."
If it is fated that our party must perish let
no historian write such an epitaph on its
tomb as this: "Came to an untimely end from
swallowing political and financial poison,"
but rather let this epitaph be written over its
honored grave, dug amid the ruins of the
Capitol: '-Itdid not survive the loss of liberty,
the destruction of the Republic and the de
cay of private morals."
Wâ¬ are the propaganda of no new creed, we
are the upholders of the old. We appeal from
Democracy, drunk with delusion, to Democ
racy, sobered by reason. With an aDidlng
faith in the intelligence and honesty of our
people, we lay before them and the world the
reason that prompts us to unfurl the old flag
that has floated over many a triumph and
many a defeat and never yet been soiled by
repudiation or stained by dishonor. We deem
it wise to pursue an aggressive rather than a
negative jolicy; to be Achilles dragging Hec
tor around the walls of Troy, rather than
Achilles sulking in his tent. We propose to
make a funeral pyre of the cadavers of Popu
ulisni and anarchy. We propose to drag be
hind our triumphal chariot wheels, in defeat
and disgrace, around the National Capitol, the
dead Frankenstein personifying their perni
cious creed and their turbulent fanaticism.
We cannot make bedfellows, even in a night
of furious storm and thick darkness, of our
lifelong antagonists. We cannot, even toes
cape as great evils as are the necessary result
of the success of the Chicago platform, be the
executioners of our loved and venerated
party. We cannot, even by implication, be
held to the false theory that the Federal power
and treasury can or ought to be used to impair
the autonomy of the States, on one hand, and,
on the other, to dispense largess to favored
classes. The election of McKinley, or of Bryan,
with our support, would mean the destruction
of our whole party for a generation, for when
our people recover from the debauch of Popu
lism and anarchy, they will discard the men
who have led their orgy. II we go to McKinley
those men will be the recognised exponents of
Democracy. Whon the fumes of the debauch
are dissipated, and sober reason resumes her
sway, our flock would turn toward its fold,
only to find it destroyed. We. therefore, stand
fast.
We sound a bugle-call throughout the limd
for all Democrats to rally for the support of
government and law, for the honor of their
0 mntry and for the maintenance and pre
servation of their creed, its memories and its
glories. If not heeded now, it will be in the
near future, and then those clouds which low
ered over our political fortunes and darkened
our councils will take flight; those eyes which
lately met in party conflict will be turned all
one way and a united aud triumphant Democ
racy will march on to victory under the tegis
of the constitutiou and under the precepts of
the apostles of our faith.
Senator Caffery's remarks were deliv
ered with much force and were greeted
with continued cheering.
When he had closed, John P. Irish of
California was introduced and made a
speech to the convention. Alluding to
the D mocratic convention held in In
dianapolis during the war, under threat,
he said, of physical extermination, he re
marKed that they were here to-day under
the threat oi extermination of that which
was dearer than life. They were here to
defend agaiust further attack the public
credit, the National honor, and the pri
vate and personal honesty of the individ
ual. [Applause.] They were met to face
a crisis more serious than any crisis that
liad been faced before. Tney were met to
oppose ibe moral force of principle and
conscience to those who would assail and
destroy the independence of the individ
ual citizen.
They were here as the representatives of
a party that opposed an organization that
had tilched its name and debauched its
principles. They represented that organ
ization and those principles which, under
the leadership of Grover Cleveland, were
in line with the ancient principles of
human liberty. [Applause.] They were
here to swear, with Jackson, "By the
Eternal" that the marrow and stre: gth
of the Democratic party should not be
obscured or belittled by Populism, [Ap
plause.] He did not care whether it was
attempted by the Populist convention at
Chicago or the Populist convention at St.
Louis. The two conventions of the year,
alike in purpose, alike in declaration, alike
in the folly of their principles and the
cunteiDDtibilities of their vagaries. [Ap
plause.] These were in fact the two twin
conventions of the year â and not "the
heavenly twins" either. [Laughter.]
''We are here," Mr. Irisn continued, "to
denounce right and left the enemies tnat
we have gained since 1884. We are here to
denounce on the right hand the Republi
can party, for by the extravagance of its
Congressional appropriations it has so
enlarged the deficiency of revenue as to
form an excuse for a renewal of the per
nicious paternal policy of protection. We
are here to denounceand antagonizeon the
left hand the Populists of Chicago and St.
Louis, for they by their threats involving
tue free coinage of silver and a slump to a
financial foundation, maue up of a depre
ciated and fluctuating currency, nave so
destroyed public confidence as to paralyze
the activities of the people of this Republic
and limited trade to such an extent that
the present impost laws passed by Con
gress do not produce the revenues they
would if confidence and prosperity were
abroad in the land.
"VVe arraign thesj two enemies of the
plain people of the Republic as co-con
spirators in a complementary and recipro
cating policy, which has produced the
conditions about which both hypocriti
cally raise whining voices of complaint
and accusation. [Laughter and cheers.]
The candidate of one combination stand
ing for an advance of price by that artifice
called protection, the other, conspirators
represented by a candidate for the Presi
dency who is preaching to the people the
gospel of high prices to be secured by re
ducing the purchasing power of our
money â each policy meaning burdens
upon the industry of the laborer, upon
the profits of enterprises and upon the
avails of investments. [Renewed cheers.]
We stand were Jefferson stood, whera
Cleveland stands, and say to these daugh
ters of the horseleech, 'A plague upon
you botn.' [Cheers and iaughter.]
Mr. Irish spoke of part of Bryan's stock
in trade being a denunciation of trusts,
ana went on to characterize Mr. Bryan as
"the agent, propagandist and commer
cial traveler of a syndicate greedier than
the cormorant" [cries of "Good" and
cheers]; a syndicate wnich gained mil
lions upon millions from the silver mines
of the West and of Mexico; a syndicate
which siands confessed upon the tongue
of its representative now traveling the
country touting lor custom for it lloud
cheers], and now in the field for the sole
and only purpose of advancing the price
of its Droaucts by making the people be
lieve that will be an advantage to'tuem.
[Applause.]
Mr. Irish, continuing, said he brought
words of good cheer to the convention
from the Pacific Coast to assure them that
after November it would be found that
California and her younger sisters. Oregon
aud Washington, had stood by the faith,
and if they had not finally vanquished one
daughter of the horseleech they had left
her without a sister.
Mr. Irish's speech was received with en
thusiastic applause throughout. As he re
sumed his seat the band played "Rally
Round the Flag," and there was quite an
ovation.
The committee on platform not being
ready to report the convention at 5: 15 r. m.
adjourned until to-morrow at 10 a. m.

FOR THIS GOLD STANDARD.
Mats- Meeting of itetnocrals Held in In
diannpolix.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind, Sept. 2.â A
mass-meeting called in support of the
sound-money movement was held this
evening in the convention hall. The at
tendance was as large as could be accom
modated in the building. The chairman,
Jobn R. Fellows, made a stronc speecn,
the striking points of which elicited fre
quent applaus-.
Louis R. Erich, one of the Colorado
delegation, was next introduced. He said
he had come to the convention against
the advice and entreaty of many friends,
who had told him that public opinion was
much intiamed m his State. He admitted
tbat it was so. but did not believe that the
State of Colorado had descended to a level
where it would not tolerate and respect
the free expression of honest opinion. He
prefaced his further remarks by a personal
statement, as showing the standpoint from
which he had investigated the question.
He said that he owned large interests in
silver mines, and thai the continued silver
agitation had made his property unsal
able.
He then, at great Jength and with very
pointed personal references to both the
Senators from Nevada, traced the history
of the silver agitation to the development
and decline of the twenty mines on the
Comsfock lode, which, after paying at one
time over .1147,000,000 in dividends, Had so
fallen away that they paid not one cent.
He cliarged that the silver child was born
in the Comstock bed. Thereafter began
the silver legislation of Congress. He fol
lowed this in detail, speaking of it as sil
ver poison which had besrun to underrrine
our monetary system, and the cure offered
was poison in larger doses. The silver
poison, he said, had affected our business
relations externally a3 well as internally.
The nations look upon us with suspicion.
Our .securities are thrown back on us and
our drained from tlie country. Our
foreign trade is diminishing. The world
hesitates to do business with a nation
which threatens to depreciate its money
standard. He concluded as follows :
"I have no fears as to the result of this
election. Its outcome will teach the on
looking nations tnat the crown of over
one hundred years of political life under
republican institutions shall not be the
national impairment of debt obligations,
and it will be heid up as a warning to our
children and our children's children that
a public policy that is tainted with but a
breath of dishonesty will be indignantly
spurned by rhi 3 pround American people.
'â¢I have the deepest sympathy with
many of the free-silver adherents. They
are my neighbors. lam bound to them
by my interests, my associations and my
affections. They are honest and sincere
men. They love their country and would
not willingly plunge it into destruction.
But they have been deluded and misled.
'The best friend of truth is time,' and as
time rolls on our misguided feiiow-citizens
will yet be grateful to those who helped
check them in their mad rush to self
destruction ; they will yet thank God for
the defeat which will overwhelm them in
November, aud they will bless us who are
assembled in Indianapolis this day. By
courage and patriotism the influences of
this convention will make that defeat in
evitable."
Hon. David Lawler of Minnesota and
several others made earnest addresses and
the meeting adjourned at a late hour.

CHEERS GIVEN FOR M'KINLEY-
Sixteen Thousand Men in the Parade.
The Contest for Commander*
in-Chief.
ST. PATJL, Minn., Bept. 2.â To the
strains of "Rally Round the Flag,"
"Marching Through Georgia," "Hail
Columbia," "The Star-spangled Banner"
and other patriotic music the veterans of
the war, 16,000 strong, made their annual
parade to-day. At sunrise the salute of
the Union of forty-five guns was fired
from Camp Mason and was followed at
9:30 by a National Presidential salute of
twenty-one guns. The various divisions
began to form at 9:30 and the column
moved an hour later. The departments
marched in the order of seniority and in
columns of platoons at half distances in
single and double rank.
There were eight divisions. In the first
â were tne veteran signal corps, depart
ments of Illinois, Wisconsin and Pennsyl
vania; second division â Ohio and New
York; third â Connecticut, Massachusetts,
New Jersey, Maine, California, Rhode
Island, New Hampshire, Vermont, Poto
mac, Virginia and North Carolina; fourth â
Maryland, Nebraska, Michigan, lowa,
Indiana; fifth â Colorado, Wyoming, Kan
sas, Delaware, Missouri, Oregon ; sixth â
Kentucky, West Virginia, .South Dakota,
Washinpton, Alaska, Arkansas, New Mex
ico, Utah and Tennessee. In the seventh
division were the departments of Louisi
ai:a, Mississippi. Florida, Montana, Texas.
Idaho, Arizona, Georgia, Alabama, North
Dakota, Oklahoma and Indian Territory.
The eighth division was composed entirely
of posts of the Minnesota department.
Many old battle-flags were carried in the
line. There was but one carriage, this
being occupied by Department Com
mander Shakespeare of Michigan, whose
disabilities prevented his marching with
his comrades. The route was short, and
over a tine asphalt road. Tbe streets were
packed with spectators, and the veterans
were given a royal reception.
Commander-in-Chief Walker, with his
staff and 1000 distinguished guests', re
viewed the parade irom a stand at Smith
Park.
The "boys" marched to the music of
wartimes â the music to which the Union
soldiers and tne Southern foe went forth in
battle to defeat and victory. They
marched with age-bent heads and proud
tieiiring, striving to keep erect and in mili
tary step and line, conscious of the fact
that death, tueir only enemy now, might
ctairn them before another grand parade.
The route was purposely made less than
two miles long and overaspsalt pavement
all the way, but many old soldiers were
physically unequal to the task, and con
tented themselves with viewing their com
rades along, the line.
The abundance of excellent brass bands
and fife and drum corps mnsic was a fea
ture of the patriotic spectacle. The start
was at Dayton and 'W estern avenues, in
the vicinity of which were thronged 10,000
sightseers in all conceivable places from
which a view of the marching could be ob
tained. The procession swung into Sixth
street, which descends. toward the busi
ness center of the city, affording the tens
of thousands on that thoroughfare a su
perb view of the great column. Every
large vacant space on Sixth street was
filled with tiers of seats for spectators.
Between the street curb and the build
ing was wedged a solid mass of humanity
along the entire route. Above them in
every window, were crowded thousands
more. The reviewing stand, where the
commander-in-chief proudly stood for
three hours receiving the salutes of his
comrades, was bnilt at Smith Park, near
tbe foot of Sixth street, which marked the
eni of the march.
A pretty picture at the starting point
was made by a lot oi little girls, stationed
at the Kittson res-idence, the ladies' head
quarters, scattering flowers upon and in
the path of the veterans as they passed by.
On an immense platform in the rear of the
partly completed Federal building was a
"living-flag" chorus of 2000 public school
children, trained by Professor Congdon
and staff. When the veterans passed by
with flags and banners fluttering in the
breeze, the band music ceased.
From the throats oi the little folk, so ar
ranged in red, white and blue and star
dresses as to form the National flag, came
an anthem of patriotism, including the
old soldiers' favorites, "Marching .through
Georgia," "Star-spancled Banner" and
"My Country 'Tis of Thee."
As the inspiriting vocal music fell on
the war patriot's ears his steps became
more elastic and he cheered his thanks to
the new generation of patriotic Ameri
cans.
In the reviewing stand on either side of
the commander and back of him were
grouped iiis staff and National officers.
All the notabk- members of the affiliated
w.mian's organizations were there. There
was frequent cheering for McKinley all
along the line by veterans and spectators.
A North Dakota veteran shouted, "Hard
wheat, hard money and McKinley."
Louisiana and Mississippi combined,
carrying at "shoulder arms" a sugar-cane
tipped with cotton balls. Every post had
a band, and none of them played badly.
General Mason. U. S. A., president of the
citizens' committee, rode with the last
division, which was composed of 2200 Min
nesota veterans, headed by the Third In
fantry ban i from Port Snelling.
At midnight the commandership fight
seemed to be narrowed down to Clarkson
of Omaha and Linehan of New Hamp
shire. New York, which was the main
stay of Meaue, has gone over to the New
Hampshire comrade, and New England
is solid for him.
Six thousand people attended a camp
fire at the Auditorium to-night. Addresses
were made by Governor Uoham of Wis
consin, General Brooke, U. S. A., Mrs.
John A. Logan and General Alger.
RACING AT SACRAMENTO.
Owyhee, Laurel and Agitato Win Purses lor
Their Owners in Harness
Events.
bACRAMENTO, Cal., Sept. 2. â The
second day of the State Fair racing meet
t- liowed a marked increase in the atten
dance, with considerable room for still
further improvement. To-morrow the
running horses will have their first inning,
and preparations are being made for a big
crowd, as the gallopers undoubtedly have j
the call with the speculating and sport
loving public.
The racing at the park to-day was list
less and utterly devoid of excitement.
Winship and Keating repeated their
Woodland successes with the fast mare
Laurel in the 2:25 trot and with the grand
three-year-old Agitato in tbe pacing event.
The latter had the field at his mercy from
the outset, not being forced to step "a mile
better than 2:l4}^.
The lirst race called was the trotting
stake for two-year-olds, worth $650 to the
winner. It was a gift for the Oakwood
Park stock farm's young giant Owyhee,
who won in straight heats; time, "2:24,
2:30. His only opponents were Uncle
Johnny and Galleno, the latter being the
Palo Alto stock farm entry. It was
looked upon as a "moral" for Owyhee,
and there was little betting on the affair.
It was the maiden appearance of Uncle
Johnny this year, and from this excellent
showing, finishing a very good second in
each heat trotted, he promises to matte a
very useful bread-winner.
The 2:25 trot was decided under the
new innovation of making each heat a
race. It looked a "cast-iron" for Laurel,
and again the bookmakers found them
selves unable to inveigle any silver into
their "take boxes" even at odds of 16 to 1
on the field. Tommy Keating slipped the
favorite past Leader, who bad the pole in
the opening heat, and stepped off the last
heat in 2:16% with pounds to spare. Maud
P, driven by Quinn, trotted a very even
mile, finishing a very creditable second.
The winner then took the following two
heats easily in 2:16^ and 2:17, followed
in by Conn and Maud P, with the others
straggling. According to the rules, she
then went to the stable, tbe fourth being
a sort of consolation heat for the less
speedy entries. This went to Conn, driven
by J. H. Kelly, with Maud P a close sec
ond.
Tommy Keating, seated on his "white
flyer," was again in evidence in the pace.
Agitato was barred in the betting, pools
selling Jennie Me $15, Joe Wheeler $10
and the field $3. There was nothing to it
but the- prohibitive choice, Agitato plac
ing the purse to his owner's credit in
struight heats, with Jennie Me the con
tender in each heat. Joe Wheeler, on
which a quiet tip was out, finished third
in the lirst heat, but thereafter was very
unsteady. Summaries:

EXAMINER'S RELAY RACE

way Track.
Mack and Koopman Make a Run of
Thirteen Miles in an Hour
and a Minute.
Hard travel seems not to daunt the
valiant riders in the transcontinental re
lay of the San Francisco Examiner and
New York Journal. Their laconic tele
grams mention rain, mud, drizzle and
encounters with untoward circumstances;
but still they press on. The following
resume of yesterday's dispatches will give
an idea of the progress made up to mid
night:

E. Hunter; Oeden, lowa, 9:48 P. si., John
Head; Boone, lowa, 11:35 p. m.,C. S. Gillilana.
The day seems to have passed without
any notable incidents, save a set-to be
tween D. G. Brewer and N. E. Pearson and
a gang oi section hands. The laconic dis
patch says merely that the two riders
were "chased off the track." No broken
bones are mentioned, nor are details of
the fray furnished. A railway track wouid
not seem to be the best sort of a bicycling
boulevard, and to be choked off even so
poor a road must be hard indeed.
J. Mack and W. J. Koopman made a run
of thirteen miles through a pouring rain
storm, bumping along over railway ties
all the way, accomplishing the feat
in sixty-one minutes, a record which will
probably make some local knights of the
wheel look to their laurels.
Meanwhile, the packet speeds gayly on
toward its destination.
DARKSEUAN SENNTION.
A Minister Arrested on a Charge of
â¢ I sing "Profane language.
SAN RAFAEL, Cal., Sept. 2.â The Rev.
J. A. Gardiner of Larkspur swore out a
warrant on Monday before Justice of the
Peace George Rodden for the arrest of
Thomas McÃride, William â¢ Whitmore,
Samuel Burtchaell, B. McCourt, J. W.
McCarty and John Frizze, on a charge of
malicious mischief. The defendants were
brought before thÂ« Justice and their case
was set for Saturday evening.
S. Burtchaell, representing the defend
ants, turned the tables on the minister to
day, with the result that a warrant has
been issued for the arrest of the Rev. Mr.
Gardiner.
It charges that "he did wilfully and un
lawfully use profane language in the
presence of women and children "
i. The trouble originated in a dispute over
land boundaries, caused by an attempt on
he part of the first arrested six men to
take gravel for county road purposes from
a creek bed, half of which Mr. Gardiner
claims as a part of his property. The case
will probably be amicably settled.

tutes. On this, fourteen Japanese sailors
attacked him in his cabin and with iron
bars broke both his arms and his nose. It
appears that the law makes it a felony to
attack a captain, but does not include
subordinate officers, hence all the insubor
dination is shown to lesser officers. â¢
It is thought this steamship line will
suffer greatly unless this state of affairs
is altered, as insurance companies will
charge higher rates to a company which
permits cargoes to be endangered by add-
ing mutiny to the other insecurities of the
nea, Â«nd timid passengers will embark on
better disciplined lines.
The Japan Herald alleges that there is
a new and widespread anti-foreign feeling
just now showing itself in Japan. Officers
of the Japanese garrison at Unrin, For
mosa, have been arrested and charged
with cowardice in having deserted their
I posts without offering any real resistance
to the Formosan rebels when the latter
attacked Unrin. The general sentiment
seems to be that if the charge is true their
conduct deserves the strongest condemna
tion; but if, as some say, they are to be
tried on the entirely different charge of
massacreing the natives the feeling is that
they should be treated with leniency, as
the Formosan natives are very fierce and
difficult to control.
The North China Daily News says that
the Japanese are flooding Formosa with
paper money, which the Chinese buy at a
discount and then send back to Japan and
convert into silver at par.
The Japanese Government and the banks
of issue make an enormous profit on their
notes by the destruction of the latter. It
is calculated that thousands of yen of
paper money was destroyed in the late
seismic wave disaster, while the conflagra
tions that are so common in Japan are
accountable for the disappearance of a
very large amount annually.
The Japan Herald says of the seventeen
American sailors and hunters of the seal
ing schooner Saipan, who are under arrest
at Vladivostock for poaching at Robber
Island that they will not be in a position
to return to Yokohama this year, but their
friends need feel no uneasiness about them
as they are having an infinitely better time
in a Russian prison than they ever en
joyed in the forecastle of a sealing
schooner. They are very well treated by
the Russian prison authorities and are
especially in clover when an American
ship touches at Vladivostok, as they are
allowed to visit her in charge of Russian
â¢soldiers.
As tobacco, drinks, etc., run free on
board the American ships when such vis
its are paid, the worthy soldiers of the
Czar encourage the pastime of paying
calls. It ends by casting a sneer at the
California papers that recently went into !
exaggerated commiseration of "the poach
ers.
Dense fogs greatly interfered with the
work of the American, British and Jap- j
anese Government expeditions, which had j
made elaborate and expensive prepara- i
tions to watch the recent sola? eclipse. At
Kobe, however, a good view was had of I
the phenomenon, and also at Yokohama. i
The Japanese papers commend the
eclipse for coming and going on schedule
time â "'wherein it differed from the ma
jority of scheduled occurrences in
Japan."
They also say that thousands of natives
who would have quivered with supersti- i
tious awe only thirty years ago at seeing' 1
the sun swallowed up, on this occasion
calmly smoked little bits of glass and
gazed through them, simply ejaculating,
"Mah!" and "Domo!" during the occulta
tion. Â£
Notwithstanding this superstition is not
entirely dead yet in Japan, for an Osako
man is doing a thriving business by means
of it. He has purchased at a preat price
a beautiful white snake and enshrined it
in a temple where the superstitious flock
to pay it homage aud tribute, believing it
to be the god of wealth. â¢ He might do well
to bring the . silvery-scaled beauty to.
America just now and herald it as a cam
paign mascot.
Sho Nemoto, the Japanese commis
sioner sent to the United States to inspect
commercial prospects, is reported to be
favorably impressed with the inducements
held out by San Diego as a terminal point
for a Japanese line of steamships.
If the iron from the iron fields at San
Isidor, Lower Caliiornia, proves of requi
site quality for steel making the indica
tions are that it will be utilized in great
quantities for building the new Japanese
navy. â  â â â¢ , â¢
Public curiosity is on the gui vive in the
Orient as to what Russia will do with the
many ship*-of- war. mobilized at Vladi
vostock. The bear seems to continue
making extensive preparations for eventu
alities and it is hinted that Russia desires
to constrain Japan to go to war with her
before Japan has completed additions to
her navy and her military power. Russia
atone, it-is intimated, is master of the sit
uation in the far east, and it is believed
it will not be long now before that power
will throw off her inscrutability and act.
Great Britain's -display of indifference is
barely commented on in the ; Oriental .
press, which is, on the whole, a very al
mond-eyed, watchful and sapient lynx
that allows little to escape it.
MICHIGAN FIRE ANFTERNS
Many Peopl* X early Jteduceel to a Con
dition of Barbariam.
CALUMET, Mich., Sept. 2.- So distress
ing has become the condition of the fire
sufferers in Ontonagon that they have
nearly been reduced to a conditioo of bar
barism. The food snpply is away below
the demand and the strong and able
bodied fight back the weak and take sus
tenance for themselves, leaving the weaker
to starve.
The authorities there have been unable
to meet the condition, and two companies
of militia have been sent to the fire dis
trict to protect the supplies against the
raids of the half-crazed sufferers. Gov
ernor Rich was appealed to and will send
the entire State militia in the upper penin
sula to guard the food if necessary.
Every soldier is supplied with twenty
rounds of ball cartridges and goes equipped
for active war. Thieves and pillagers will
be shot down if necessary to protect the
weak.

LI TALKS TO THE
NEWSPAPER MEN,
He Thinks There Are Too
Many Political Parties
in America.
BIG BUILDINGS A STUDY
Looks for a Repeal or Modifica
tion of the Chinese Exclu
sion Law.
AN ADVOCATE OF CHEAP LABOR
He Declares That American Capitalists
Would Be Treated Fairly in
China.
NEWvYORK, N. V., Sept. 2.â By pre
vious arrangement Li Hung Chang, the
Chinese Embassador, this morning re
ceived a limited number of representatives
of the press in his apartments at tbe
Waldorf. The newspaper men were pre
sented to the Viceroy by Edward B.
Drew, Commissioner of Royal Taxes in
China. The Viceroy's medical adviser,
Dr.' Bark, acted as interpreter. The
much-described yellow jacket was not in
evidence during the interview, the
Viceroy being attired in a costume of
plum-colored silK. The first question
asked was :
"Your Excellency, since you have said
so many good things about us, we desire
to know in what respect we have disap
pointed you?"
The Viceroy replied: "I have no com
plaint to make of my reception in this
country. I don't think I could say any
thing bad about you unless it were that
you have too many political parties.
Cannot the newspapers unite these
parties?"
"What has been most interesting to you
in America?"
"I have been charmed with many things.
In fact, everything has delighted me so
much that it is hard to say in which I
have been most interested. The big build
ings are specially enteresting. i have
never seen such tall buildings before.
These structures of twenty or more stories
are great works of architecture. They
would not do, however, in China, where
we have so many typhoons. But I have
heard that in this country you have no
such winds and that you are safe. The
elevators make them accessible."
"Have you any comparisons to make be
tween America and England?"
'"No, I would not like to make any. The
Americans came originally from England,
and whatever you do here you have learned
from England. For that reason it would
be indelicate to draw comparisons."
"What has impressed you most during
yourjreceptions in New York â the demon
strations of the common people, such as
you witnessed yesterday, or the attentions
shown you by the dignataries of the coun
try?"
To thistjuestion the interpreter replied:
"The Viceroy says that he knows some
thing, but that he will keep it to himself."
"Do you look for a repeal or a modifica
tion of the so-called Chinese exclusion law
passed by our Congress in 1892? It has
also been called the Geary act."
"I know very well that you are soon to
have an election and perhaps a change in
the Government. For this reason I have
not mentioned or discussed tbe Geary act
with your Government officials. I desire
the assistance of the press in an effort
which will be made later to do away with
this law. I know that the press is the
most influential institution in this coun
try."
"Was the route through Canada decided
upon because of any antagonism that
might assert itself among the people of
the Pacific Coast States?"
At this point the Viceroy called for his
official interpreter, Lo Fung Lu. to whom
he made the following reply: "The choice
of the Canadian route was determined
upon for two reasons â first, while I was
High Commissioner of the northern por
tion of China, I received many complaints
from onr Chinese subjects in this country
that they were not in possession of the
rights to which they were entitled here,
and they invoked my assistance to secure
for them full rights. Your laws here now
curtail these rights, and 1 did not care to
go through the States where the people
had been most instrumental in bringing
about these restricting laws. Second,
while I am a good sailor, lam an old mail,
and I have been informed that the steam
ers sailing from Vancouver are much more
comfortable than those leaving San Fran
cisco."
Without waiting for another question
the Viceroy again turned bis attention to
the Geary act. "Chinese exclusion is
most unfair. Competition is good for any
country. Competition keeps the marKets
in a healthy condition, whether this com
petition is in the price of labcr or commod
ity. The Geary act was brought about by
the Democratic party and the Irish people
because the Chinese are the rivals of the
Irish laborers. Put aside the fact that I
am a liigh official and speaking as a cos
mopolitan, let me ask if such a law is in
the interest of American people? Is it
good policy to exclude cheap labor? Would
you exclude cheap commodities? You are
proud of your ingenuity, you boast of your
liberty and freedom, but there is no free
dom of labor. I cannot see the fruits and
effects oi this liberty. You are not only a
people of great inventions, but yon
are a country of large agricultural
resources and a country of commerce
and industry. England is purely a coun
try of industry. You make better ma
chinery and agricultural implements than
any other nation in the world, but these
manufactures are unfortunately so ex
pensive tnat in foreign markets their sale
is limited. This is because your labor is
so high. If you let in cheap labor you
can sell your goods more cheaply.
"What inducements are offered to
American capitalists to invest in Chinese
enterprises?''
"The Chinese Government invites every
one of wealth, no matter to wr-at nation
he belongs, to come to China and invest in
our enterprises. General Grant was my
best friend, and I shall never forget his
advice torn c upon this subject. He said:
'You trust invite American capitalists to
China, but Â»he administration mustalways
remain iii the hands of the Chinese Na
tion. China must maintain its sovereign
rights.' I remember that advice warmly
in my heart. American captalists who
may decide to invest la China will be
treated the same as those of other coun
tries, but we must retain tbe administra
tive power."
In reply to further questions Li said his
country would perhaps study the English
and American educational systems and
choose the better of the two. He said
there were many newspapers in China,
but they had no circulation to speak of
because their editors were not truthful.
The Viceroy declared with a smile that
the newspaper cuts of him in this country
were very bad.

BACK FROM CRATER LAKE.
m
Partial Success of the United States For-
estry Commission's Trip to the
Mountains.
PORTLAND, Or.. Sept. 2.-W. G. Steel,
who guided the Forestry Commission to
Crater Lake, returned to-day. The com
mission consists of Professor Sargent of
Harvard Univerity (chairman), Mr. Pin
chot (secretary). Professor Brewer of Yale
College, Mr. Hague of the United Slates
Geological Survey and General Abbot.
They were accompanied by John Muir of
California, alter whoni the Muir glacier in
Alaska is named and who has a thorough
knowledge of the regions to be visited on
this coast by the Commissioners.
"Mr. Hague, Mr. Muir, Mr. Pinohot and
I started out in a boat to visit Wizard
Island,"; said ; Mr. Steel," but we were
overtaeen by a storm of wind and rain
which compelled us to go ashore, where
we built a campfire and dried ourselves as
best we could. It was then|to late too go
to the island, and we had to give up the
trip entirely. Immediately after the
storm the atmosDhere cleared sufficiently
for us to see the dim outlines of the oppo
site shore, live miles distant. The next
morning, when we had to leave, a heavy
fog prevailed, and we could not see the
laKe at all."
The Commissioners were very much in
terested in tbe flora of the entire route;
and although they did not see Crater
Lake as it should be seen, they were very
much impressed with it. They expressed
themselves in unmeasured tÂ»rms denun
ciatory of the vandals who persisted in de
stroying the natural scenery by sticking
their names and advertisements on
rocks and trees, and they tore down every
advertisement that they came across.
SAUSALITO MAN'S PERIL
J. Haffoer Walks From the
Ferry Wharf While Tem
porarily Insane.
By Means of Boathooks the Unfortu
nate Man Is Rescued From
the Water.
SAUSALITO, Cal., Sept. 2.â J. Haffner,
a large property-owner of Sausalito, while
suffering from temporary insanity induced
by sickness, walked from his home at an
early hour yesterday morning, strolled
onto fche ferry wharf and fell into the
water, but was rescued before it was too
late. '
Mrs. Haffner, who was seen last evening
by a Call representative, said: "My hus
band has for some' days been suffering
from a severe cold that finally terminated
in pneumonia. Last nieht he arose from
iiis bed and went downstairs My daugh
ter Â»nd myself as soon as we discovered
his absence vent down after him, but he
had disappeared from the house.
"We then ran down to Mr. Simpton, an
old friend of ours, to ask him to help us
find him. Afterward Mr. Hernan, a friend
who lives at our house, and my daughter
went searching for him by the water
front."
"I first discovered him," said Miss Haff
ner, "near the end of the *\ - harf. I could
scarcely distinguish him in the darkness.
As soon as I spoke to him he arose as if to
meet me, but fell backward into the water.
I ran around to the steamer Sausalito,
moored close by, and was met by the
watchman.
"He and two other men dragged father
from the waterwith boathooks. My father
has Deen worried for some time because of
the grading being done on our land down
near the street. This and his illness made
him delirious."
Mr. Huff ner's condition was critical this
evening.
NEWELL ILL AT SEATTLE,
The Detroit's Commander Can
Survive but a Few Days
at the Utmost.
In His Delirium He Recalls the Out
rages and Executions at
Kiepsim.
SEATTLE, Wash., Sept. 3.â At the
home of ex-Mayor Frank D. Black in this
city, Captain John Stark Newell, com
mander of the armored United States
cruiser Detroit, now stationed in Chinese
waters, is dyinp. Dr. J. B. Eagleson, the
attending physician, said to-day that bis
death was liable to occur at any hour,
though life might be prolonged a day or
so. For twenty-four hours he has been
unconscious, and Lieutenant-Commander
Taussig of the monitor Monartnock, now
at Port Angeles, last night telegraphed to
the department at "Washington City that
Captain Newell could not live.
Captain Newell arrived in this city on
July 23, from China, on his way to Wash
ington Ci*y to make a report on the Kiep
fimtCentral China) missionary massacres.
He called at the home of ex-Mayor Black
for a few days' rest, and three days after
his arrival became ill. His illness was the
effects of malaria, contracted in China,
culminating in a complication of diseases.
His wife, who came out from New York
four weeks ago, is with him.
It will be recalled that a Methodist mis
sionary station at Kiepsim was raided by
a Chinese mob about a year auo and sev
eral men, women arid children were
butchered by the frenzied fanatics. The
murdered people were Americans, and
this Government decided to investigate
the outrages. Captain Newell, with an
escort, was dispatched from Port Arthur
to the scene of the murders. He traveled
up the river Mini until he arrived at Kiep
sim. There the murderers were tried and
fifteen of them were beheaded in the pres
ence of Captain Newell.
After ths executions Captain Newell re
turned to the United States, and when he
arrived in this city was on his way to
Washington City to report the result of
iiis investigations. His written report,
tbe contents of which are not known, but
which will be of international importance,
is now in the hands of tbe authorities at
Washington City.
In his delirium Csptain Newell has re
called the outrages against his country
men, demanding reparation from China,
and he daily reviews the horrible scene
when fifteen Chinese were beheaded.

A Former Partner Suspected of Hay.
ing Stolen the Dead Man's
Fortune.
PORTLAND, Ok., Sept. 2.â Barney W.
Tiiden, who a few months ago moved to
South Portland from the neighborhood of
Jacksonville, is in receipt of a letter from
a brother, which clears a mystery of over
twenty years' standing. Tilden's brother,
who is a miner living ten miles south of
Jacksonville, writes that he and two other
miners on Saturday last came across a
human skeleton lying in a large rift of a
quartz ledge on the side of a mountain on
which they were prospecting.
The remains, all but the skull and
shoulder-bones, were covered with almost
a foot of drift rock, which it had taken
years- to accumulate. The writer and his
companions were prompted to remove the
dsbris in the hope of finding something to
enable them to identify the skeleton.
"I was amazed â yes. stricken with inde
scribable terror,' 1 added the writer,
â¢'when I found it impossible for me to
avoid realizing tnat the remains before me
were those of your long missing brother
in-law. There is no question of the iden
tity, for on tbe left little linger I discovered
the identical amethyst that, mother gave
him on Christmas day, 1873. To satisfy
me beyond any possible donbt that the
skeleton was that of Tom I found by his
side a package of molded papers, most of
which were yet quite decipherable.
Among these papers were two of your let
ters, written from Sacramento in August,
1875, and the rest were from Mollie.
"The most fearful thing connected with
this discovery was an indelible pencil
scrawl on the face of a loose letter, closely
resembling Tom's handwriting, reading:
'I was murdered by John R â ,' ana then
followed a scrawl which could not be read.
It seems to me that Tom must have lost
consciousness before he was able to finish
the sentence.
"An examination of the skull disclosed
that it had been fractured. But if he waa
murdered it rould not have been for rob
bery, because in the rift close by the re
mains, we found his gold watch and $83
in gold and silver. Do you remember any
one whose name began with John R. who
associated with Tom?"
Tiiden, who leaves for the sonth to
night, says that in May. 1876, his brother
in-law, Thomas S. Darling, who had been
in business here a short time, wrote him
that he was going to Southern Orefjon to
look after some mining property. That
was the last letter Tiiden ever received
from Darling.
Darling came herp from California bring
ing with him between $6000 and $7000 to
enpage in the real estate and brokerage
business. At that time he was almost 29
years old, and he took with him an old
schoolmate, Chauncey Demming, ns a sort
of partner. Tiiden found Dernming here,
but h? could throw no light upon the
probable whereabouts of his friend.
"Without wishing to burden you with a
long story,'' remarked Tiiden. "I will only
add that poor Tom never was found, and
neither was the money he brought here
with him. Deming, thougn, returned .to
California shortly after I came here, he
taking very little interest in Tom's fate,
and located in San Francisco. Six months
later I heard that he loomed up as a min
ing-stock operator. I never knew him to
have a dollar in Sacramento, but it was re
ported to me that Chaunoey was quite flush
when he went into stocks. I don't think
he killed poor Tom, but I'll take an oath
that he robbed him. Demming .died at
the bay about a year a^o as poor as a
charoh mouse, although at one time ha
was rated at $200,000, all made out of the
money I believe he stole from his unfortu
nate friend."

GREGORY IS
CONVICTED
Guilt Pronounced Upon the
Third Round Valley
Assassin.
MURDER IN THE SECOND
DEGREE.
No Recommendation of Mercy
in the Verdict of the
Jury.
GEORGE E. WHITE SCORED IN
COURT.
Deputy Attorney-General Post De
clares tbe "Kicg" Planned
Litthfijld's Death.
WEAVERVILLE, Cal., Sept. 2.â Joe
Gregory, the cowardly murderer, who shot
from ambush and killed the disarmed and
helpless vaquero, Albert D. Littlefield,
better known as "Jack" Littlefleld, near
Long Ridge, on September 27, 1895, and
Joe Gregory, the Convicted Round
Valley Assassin.
who subsequently desecrated the grave of |
his victim in the most fiendish manner,
was convicted of murder in the second de
gree in the Superior Court of Trinity |
County this evening, at 7:30 o'clock.
Long before court opened this morning j
an eager and excited throng had taken
possession of every available inch of room
in the courtroom, overflowed into the cor
ridors and extended from the stairway
into the street, for the closing scenes in
the trial of the third Round Valley assas
sin to be convicted of murder this year
was a matter of some interest to the peo
ple of Trinity County, who trembled for
fear lest through some miscarriage of the
law the accused should be released and a
reign of terror follow.
A vague rumor had been heard upofl the
street that a certain juror had been tam
pered with, and it was with a profound
sigh of relief that the crowd listened to
the verdict handed to the Judge by George
F. Chapman, foreman of the jury, that
the jury found the defendant guilty of
murder in the second degree and without
recommending mercy.
It was just after the jury had returned
to the courthouse from dinner, and the
swarm of women who had sweltered in the
close room all day were conspicuous for
their absence. The murderer, who, dur
ing the arguments of both the prosecution
and the defense, had evinced an intense
interest, together with extreme nervous
ness, accompanied by intermittent moods
of the gravest abstraction and musing,
had apparently composed himself, and
when the verdict was announced not a
tremor passed over his dark countenance,
and it was apparent that he had fortified
himself for the reception of newa of a
more serious fate.
At 5:30 o'clock the case was given into
the hands of the jurors and exactly two
hours later the verdict was returned. It
gives general satisfaction, for there are
four other accomplices to the murder of
Littlefield awaiting trial at Weaverville
and it is believed that his fate will be
theirs.
The opening speech for the prosecution
was made by James W. Bartlett, the pros
ecuting attorney for Trinity County. He
tersely and briefly narrated the theory of
the prosecution and described the circum
stances attending L.ittlefibld'i death.
After him followed Robert R. Fowler, as
â istant counsel for the defense. He made
an eloquent plea to the jurors. Then
Oregon Sanders arose and for two hours
pleaded for the life and liberty of the de
fendant. It was evident from the begin
ning that the plan of the defense was to
assail and impeach the character of and
testimony given by the witnesses for the
prosecution, as he later admitted that he
had never found it so hard to talk upon a
case in his life as upon this.
At the commencement of his speech
Sanders cautioned the jurors against
tribal jealousy, which he professed that
he believed to exist between the counties
of Mendocino and Trinity. In succession
he took up witnesses Hoglan, Wilburn,
Hanover and Doolittle, branding them as
cattle thieves, squawmen, rascals in gen
eral. He dwelt upon the fact that no
blood or water had been found upon the
clothing of the defendant.
Before Deputy Attorney-General C. N.
Post entered upon the body of his argu
ment, he spoke of the pleasant relations
that had existed between himself and the
opposing counsel, and paid a well-deserved
tribute to fearless Tom Bergin, the tall,
sinewy young Sheriff of Trinity County,
who worked relentlessly and regardless of
his own safety to bring the murderers out
of their stronghold to justice. Then he
said:
"You remember what I told you in my
opening statement, and I believe that I
have kept my word. I said 1 would prove
a conspiracy, and now I say that George
E. White was the head and front of this
conspiracy. It was only necessary for
him to intimate that it would be an agree
able thing to him if such a man be re
moved and it would be done."
He stated that the conspiracy which had
been laid at the door of George Â£. White
stood undenied; that "there had been no
questions asked Mr. White as to whether
he had discussed the killing ol'Latlerield,
and that he had not denied."
At tnis point George White showed con
siderable agitation and arose and asked a
question in a whisper of one of the lawyers
for the defense.
Post bitterly arraigned the witnesses for
the defense, who had endeavored to im
peach Hanover and McDonald on account
of their attempted boxinz match.
' Sanders had said that he wished the
testimony given by some of the witnesses
for the prosecution wippd out, and Post
said that had they told all they knew be
fore coming to Weaverville "they would
have been 'wiped out 1 from off the face of
the earth, they having a method of re
moving and 'wiping out 1 men over there,
and O'Neil knew it when he had lied
about the time Gregory had returned to
the Vinton cabin."
It will be remembered tbat Vinton, one
of the conspirators, had been shot a short
time before the murder of Littlefield, and
Post stated that he believed that Vinton
had accidentally shot himself as he was
dismounting from his horse, as it was his
custom to carry his rifle before him across
his saddle; that Vinton, after wounding
himself, had conceived the shrewd scheme
of laying the shooting upon Littleneld, and
that for this reason he had removed and
destroyed his overshirt, which was prob
ably powder-burned, and that while lying
at the house of Tom Haydon he had
batched and matured the conspiracy and
put it into action, which resulted in
Littletield's death. It appeared, he said,
that Vinton bad "hanging on the brain"
for a long time and did not fail to tell
everybody he met about it.
During the day Gregory sat between his
mother and sister. It was apparent that
each of the trio was expecting the worst.
Many denudes have been sworn in by
the Sheriff in tbe past few days, as it is
feared an attempt at jailbreaking will be
made. It is expected that other arrests
are to be made. Gregory will be sentenced
on Saturday, when Oregon Sanders will
ask for a new trial.
HAZING AT PALO ALTO,
Freshmen at the University
the Victims of Rough
Treatment.
Given Baths at Untoward Hours oi
the Night ani Pelted With
Ancient Eges.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Sept.
2. â The freshmen have been civen a hot
reception at the university. There has
been a great deal of rough treatment of
the new classmen, which has caused many
threats of dire revenge on their part. In
the young men's dormitory the freshmen
have been taken from taeir rooms and
given baths at untoward hours of the
night.
A company of twenty sophomores cap
| tured eight freshmen at Palo Alto last
| night and drummed up a crowd of about
200 citizens with an impromptu band.
The freshmen were compelled to stand
upon the campaign platform erected there
and talk for a half hour each, wuile they
I were made easy marks for eggs, potatoes
I and other rubbish. One young man was
made to sing the popular song, "Good
Night, Ladies," while vis efforts were ap
plauded with a shower of stale eges. The
freshman was struck in the eye with an
egg and badly hurt. It was thought for
some time that the eye would be lost, but
after the shell was taken out the disciple
of Parneli was made to continue his song
, with no more serious injury than a very
j black optic.
It is not known who threw the missile.
The matter was much talked of in the
university town to-day.
Architect Hodges says that there will be
no new university building this fall. Sev
eral fraternities contemplate building
houses. The Chapter of Delta Upailon
already has a house planned for, and the
Phi Delta Thetas may build.
SCENES AT THE STATE FAIR AT SACRAMENTO.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 3, 1896.
FEIST OF BEAUTY
AT SACRAMENTO.
The State Fair Pavilion and
Its Many Fine
Exhibits.
NOVEL IDEAS EVOLVED.
Artist Weisel's Cartoons Come
Near Precipitating a
Fight
INCUBATORS AND ICEBERGS.
Chickens Hatched in Sight of Sp-cta
tors Near a Scene of Arctic
Grandeur.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Bent. 2. â The
second day of the State Fair brought a
larger attendance, both at the track and
at the pavilion. The exhibits are worth
coming miles to see, and as for the races,
a swifter or more nimble string of horses
from all sections of the country baa not
been seen on any California track this sea
son. To-night the pavilion reverberated
with music. It was a festival of pure
melody, and it and the exhibits were en
joyed by an increasing attendance free
from the jam of a great crowd.
But there are plenty of seats for the
crowd when it does begin to flow through
the gates. The trains are bringing mora
visitors almost every hour. Public con
veniences for handling the throngs are ex
cellent. Trolley-cars, and plenty of them,
and numerous other conveyances whisk
The visitor out to racetrack or pavilion in
a few minutes.
When the bell sounded at 10:30 o'clock
to-night for Ihe close of the pavilion a de
lighted procession of spectators filed slow
ly out of the building.
A youthful Sacramento cartoonist has
caused a sensation at the pavilion section
of the big State Fair. The sensation ex
tended to the street, where the artist's
father was getting thrashed or thrashing
the other fellow. In one corner of the pa
vilion and separate from the art gallery
was a display of pen-and-ink sketches by
Chris Weisel, a lad said to be only 16 years
ot age. The work is remarkably well done
for a lad of his years. It would do credit
to artists of more age and experience.
The subjects of many of his sketches are
well-known Sacramento men. The like
nesses are striking in almost all instances,
but with the enthusiasm of youth he has
given the subject a disagreeable and un
just turn without, perhaps, any intention
of offending.
For instance, a caricature of Judge W.
A. Henry occupies a prominent place. He
is portrayed as armed with a cupid's bow,
and is as scantily clad as the little god of
love ever is when he whispers in the ears
of maidens. A member of the Board of
Trustees cf the city is pictured as receiv
ing a flow of gold in capacious hands, and
this is labeled "Honesty." A prominent
banker is illustrated as squeezing the life
out of a farmer, mortgagor and mort
gagee. C. P. Huntington, H. M. La Rue
and Grove L. Johnson are pictured in a
schoolroom in the year 1840. and a pupil
is explaining to the teacher how they suc
ceeded in life. Mayor Sutro of San Fran
cisco does not escape the facile pencil and
graphic idea of this youthful cartoonist,
and this picture was perhaps the best in
I the lot. The likeness almost speaks. The
Mayor is seen lying fu length in a bath
tub, with a scrubbing brush in one hand.
A local editor was also undesirably cari
catured.
There was such a "kick" from the per
sons caricatured that the board of di
rectors of the agricultural society to-day
ordered the collection removed. To-night
there was no crowd around the pictures,
and there was a blank space on the wall.
Shortly before noon to-day Frank M.
Woodson, a son of one of the cartoon sub
jects, met Chris Weisel Sr. at Eighth and
X streets. The young man had blood in
his eye. He charged Weisel pere witli
having inspired the cartoon on his
father. The elder Weisel replied that he
was not responsible for the work of
Weisel fils, but young Woodson repeated
and emphasized the charge. Owing to the
intervention ot by-standers no blood was
spilled.
One of the living attractions at the fair
is Vahan Aslanian, a young Armenian,
who has been in this country only three
weeks. Isaac Banyakar. an Armenian,
known to fame in Sun Francisco for Lav
ing named his hrst born, a girl, California,
and his three weeks' old son McKinl y
Banyakar, has an exhibit, and he points
with native pride to this new immigrant.
Aslanian is a husky young fellow about 21
years of age. He is attired in a Bedouin
suit with a green feather in his cap. He
bristles with a long and wicked-looking
! knife such as the Armenians use in mak
ing their feeble fights against the Turks.
He is also heavily laden with cartridge
belts full of cartridges about three inches
long.
Aslanian is always the center of a crowd
and he seems to enjoy it. In broken Eng
lish he tells wonderful stories of the lights
he has had with the Tuiks in his native
town of Mar3odan.
He attended an American missionary
I school there and picked up a little Eng
lish. He corroborates the published
j stories about Armenian girls and brides
being carried off into the mountains by
the cruel Turks. Upon one occasion some
of his own female friends were among the
number.
Banyakar also has on exhibition Califor
! nia and McKinley Banyakar.

is so orilliantly illuminated is generated

Oa the pinnacle of an iceberg float the
stars and stripes, and at one period, while
there was an admiring crowd before the
scene, Cassasa's band happened to play
The Star-spangled Banner." The crowd
: applauded appropriately, and a voice was
j lifted up with these words: "Nansen ain't
in it."
The figures are seen to move on the ice,
and behind tnem a miniature ship rocks
on the waves of the cold ocean. At regu
lar intervals there is the red and yellow

Among the exhibits are bicycles almost
without number. One firm has a negro

i see them on canvas. There is one canvas
I pumpkin there which looks natural and
ripe enough to fall into pies at the glance
of the beholder. There are also canvas
grapes and watermelons in the art gallery
beautifully garnished with canvas roses
and vines.
One of the most conspicuous exhibits in
the pavilion is made by the Buffalo Brew
; ing Company of Sacramento. It has an
octagonal pagoda, the sides and roof of
which are composed of bottled beer. The
liquid is highly illuminated by a'powerful
electric arc light inside.
; A unique hardware exhibit is made by
! Schaw, Ingram, Butcher <fc Co., and it is
i one of the largest in the pavilion. Water

at Night.
DUEL AT CLOSE RANGE.
Daniel Wynne, His Assailant, Is
Dying From a Bullet
Wound.
WEKE THE BEST OF FRIENDS.
Drunken Fury Incites the Attack
Upon the Unoffending PatroU
man.
VALLEJO, Cal., Bept. 2.âNightwatch
man Frank Toal was shot and killed by
Dan T. Wynne, in front of J. W. O'Brien's
saloon on Georgia street, near the wharf,
at 1 o'clock this morninpr. The night
watchman, after receiving his death
wound, shot Wynne, inflicting a wound
almost identical to that received by him
self, and which will, without doubt, prove
fatal.
Several young men were in O'Brien's
saloon last night when Wynne entered the
place. He had been drinking and com
menced to argue with the others on one
subject and another, the principal topic
being the claim that one of them, named
Magee, was opposed to bis securing a fran
chise from the Board of City Trustees to
run a row boat ferry to the navy yard.
This Magee denied.
Wynne then turned his attention to the
bali-dozen other men in the saloon and
proposed to "clean them out." One re
marked that he was ready for Wynne, who
immediately turned about, and as he
passed out of the front doors, remarked
he. "would see about that."
Wynne was gone from ten to fifteen
minutes, his residence being a couple of
biocks distant. While he was away the
proprietor of the saloon went and stood in
the front door, Magee passing out and
going home. While he was standing in the
doorway Officer Toal came down Georgia
street from the City Jail, where he had
just picked up a young fellow for disturb
ing the peace. He paused for a moment
to chat, and on being told that Wynne
was drinking he replied: "That is too bad.
Dan is a good fellow when he is sober, but
when in liquor he is not himself. lam
afraid there will be trouble."
The officer then passed on down to
ward Georgia-street wharf, as it was his
custom at thafhour of the morning to
see that everything was all right at the
lower end of the street and about ttie
wharf. He was hardly out of sight before
O'Brien saw Wynne coming from the
direction of the northwest corner of Santa
Ciara and Georgia streets, Wynne's resi
dence being on Santa Clara street and
O'Brien's saloou in the Greeves building,
second door from Santa Clara street. In
Wynne's right hand, which was hanging
by his side, 0 Britn saw a revolver flash
ing in the rays from the street gaslight.
O'Brien, knowing the reputation of
Wynne for shooting while in liquor,
backed into the saloon and said to the
boys who were standing at the oar: "Look
out now for trouble. Wynne is coming
back with bis gun." O'Brien passed to the
rear of the saloon for a moment, and
while there Wynne entered. The first
person he encountered was a man named
Hurley, whom he hit a terrific blow with
the muzzle of the pistol over the fore
head, cutting a severe gash, which after
wards required a number of stitches to
bring it together. Hurley ran to the
room back of the saloon proper and
called for water to bathe his head.
O'Brien, having provided himself with
means for sell-defense, went up to Wynne,
who was flourishing his. weapon and de
claring that he was a second Jesse James,
and that he intended to kill them all.
O'Brien is nearly a head shorter than
Wynne, who is over six feet tall, but he
backed Wynne up against the casing of
the swinging noors and told him not to
make any disturbance in the place; if he
wanted to shoot any one to shoot him
first. Wynne attempted to push him
away, saying be wanted to have no
trouble with him, but that he was going
to shoot "Billy," the bartender.
Just then Officer Toal pushed the swing
ing doors open far enough lo look in. See
ing the pistol in Wynne's hand, he drew
back, the doors closing again. Wynne
saw the face of the officer, and believing
Toal had come to arrest him, leaped back
a pace and then sprang forward, pushing
the doors outward toward the sidewalk.
He fired one shot, which evidently missed
its mark.
O'Brien jumped through the doors to
the sidewalk to stop, if possible, the shoot
ing, as he knew the two men were friends
and neither of tern afraid of bullets. As he
reached the sidewalk he saw the two men,
equal in height, close together, each with
a pistol in his hand, the muzzle pressed
against the other's breast. He heard two
shots fired almost simultaneously and
heard Officer Toal exclaim :
"Dan, what have you done? You have
killed me, and I guess I have finished
youl"
Wynne fell back to the sidewalk and
Toale threw his arms around O'Brien a
moment and said :
"Send for a doctor and a prieat. I will
not last more than an hour."
He staggered about twenty-five feet
down the sidewalk and fell upon the steps
in front of Passalacqua's fruitstore with
out a sound. Wynne was lying on the
walk, groaning loudly and pleading to be
taken home. O Brien dashed into the
saloon and told tne men inside to come
out and help carry the wounded man in
sidfl. They first went to the officer, care
fully lifted him from the steps, carried
him into the saloon and laid him on a
billiard-table. They opened his shirt and
saw streams of blood running from a gap
ing hole in his back, from which the bul
let had emerged.
Wynne was then brought in and laid on
the floor a short distance from where the
officer was lying, with his life fast ebbing
away.
In a short time Dr. Carpenter arrived
and pronounced Toal's wound fatal, the
ball having entered about nine inches be
low the left nipple, passed through the
body, and come out about five inches be
low the right scapula. The condition of
Wynne seemed to bÂ« about the same.
Shortly after the arrival of the surgeon
a young priest came from St. Vincent's
Church. He was none to early, for just
as be had concluded the sprinkling of tooly
water over the officer Toal slowly opened
bis eyes, and with a smiie on his lips
gasped slightly anl breathed his last.
In the meantime Wynne was writhing
upon the floor and upbraiding Toal for
snooting him. He uttered no regrets at
the death of the man but a few feet from
dim. Wynne was taken to bis home and
Officer Toal's boiy to Connelly's under
taking parlors, where to-da/ it was viewed
by many friends.
Toal was a native of the County Fer
mauaugh, north of Ireland, where his
parents, brothers and sisters reside. He
came to San Francisco about eight years
ago and for 3ome years was employed on
ihe Market-street cable road as a brake
man. His health failing, he came to V*l
lejo. and though a comparative stranger
was at once entraged by the City Trustees
as night watchman. He proved to be
brave and efficient.
Sureeons Vallejo and Anderson suc
ceeded about 10 o'clock this morning in
removing the bullet from Wynne's back,
but it is not believed that ne can recover.
A priest went to the home of Wynne
this afternoon and there offered prayers in
behalf of the wounded man. Wynne has
made his will. He is said to be worth
about 115,000.
The funeral of Officer Toal will take
piece on Friday under the auspices of the
Red Men, of which order he was a mem
ber.
PLEADS GUILTY OF MURDER.
Hugh McMillan Surprises Court Spec
tutor* at Sonora. â 
STOCKTON, Cal., Sept. 2.â There was
an astonished crowd in the Superior Court
at Sonora to-day when Hugh McMillan,
charged with the murder of O. Swan, late
of Sonora, but formerly of Stockton, con
fessed to his guilt-
The killing took place last June in tne
mountains back of Sonora. McMillan,
Swan and another man started out from
Sonora on a prospecting trip. Later
Swan's lifeless body was found by a party
of hunters, and McMillan was arrested on
suspicion of being one of the murderers.
There was absolutely no direct evidence
against him. To-day, to the amazement
of the court and the assembled spectators,
his attorney asfeed permission, at McMil
lan's request, to have the plea of not guilty
changed to one of guilty.
The court asked the prisoner if he fully
realized the situation. McMillan replied
that he did.
"Do you know,'' asked the court, "that
pleading guilty to a charge of murder in
the first degree, you may hang or be sent
to the penitentiary for life; or, if in the
second decree, to imprisonment for not
less than ten years or possibly to life im
prisonment?"
"Yes sir ; I killed him, of course," Mc-
Millan replied.
The prisoner is a powerful, intelligent
miner, but he trembled visibly as he stood
before the court and pleaued guilty to the
charge of murder. He showed that he
could no longer stand the strain of keep
ing his terrible secret.
The court adjourned after this confeeh
sion, and to-morrow the testimony of Mc-
Millan as to how he killed Swan will be
submitted. It is believed tbat Swan was
possessed of a considerable sum of money
and that robbery was the motive for the
crime.

LOS ANGELES, Cal., Sept. 2.âCon
gressman W. W. Bowers of the Seventh
District has sent the following open letter !
to a newspaper at San Bernardino with a
request to publish:
Please permit me to say that the article first
appearing iv tne Examiner and widely copied
throughout the State stating that I had re
ceived letters from Mark Hanna and from 'â 
bankers in the East telling me I must not talk [
silver, etc.. and that I was going to denounce j
them on the stump is a fabrication from be
ginning to end. Mr. Copeland never said aiiv
thinÃ oi the kind. I have received no such >
letters, consequently am not called upon to
denounce anybody. The article was concocted
in Los Angeles, where, as you are aware, I
have some left-hnnried friends, particularly !
one newspaper which claims to be Republican I
but hasneverfailed to lend itself to help defeat
a part of the Republican ticket. It ia impos

SANTA ROSA, Cal., Sept. 2.â The free

THE NATIVE DAUGHTERS
Joaquin Parlor's Splendid Work
in Preparing for the
Festival
SCCIETY AT A MINSTREL SHOW
The Admission Day Fund Swelled by
an Enormous Sale of
Tickets.
STOCKTON, Cal., Sept. 2â Stockton
was in gala attire to-night. The long lines
of electric lights thatline Main street from
the railway depot to El Dorado street and
along that street to the Masonic Temple
were ablaze. They were red, white, blue
and gold, the golden color predominating.
Thousands of people witnessed the spec
tacle and none had aught but words of
praise for the committee on decoration
that had arranged the electrical display.
The dome of the Courthouse was also
lighted with its 1000 incandescent globes
ana the whole effect was wonderlully
beautiful.
Seldom have the streets of any city pre
sented a more pleasing spectacle than that
which met the eye of the promenader on
Main street to-night. Hundreds of pretty
women, all attired in light evening
dresses, all bound for the big performance
for the benefit of the carnival fund, were
passing. Beneath this blaze of many
colored lights the procession of fair ones
looked exceptionally pretty.
All day long the decorators were at work
placing bunting on the fronts of the prin
cipal Main-street stores, and to-night,
when the thousands of electric lights
were turned on, making the city bright as
day, the scene was decidedly an attractive
one and highly gratifying to those Native
Sons who have been urging the store
keepers to "put their best foot forward"
during the coming three days of Admis
sion day festivities.
The work of the various committees is
about ended, bo far as planning is con
cerned, and now the members are seeing
that their schemes are properly carried
out. The Native Sons and Pioneers will
be admitted free of charge to the ball in
Agricultural pavilion on the night of Sep
tember 9, but others will be taxed $2 each,
every tickei entitling a lady and gentle
man to admittance. The Native Daugh
ters will be out in force on that night.
They have long been preparing for the
event, and Joaquin Parlor No. 5, now
nearly 100 strong, will be there in a body.
Numbers have been added to the member
ship roll at every meeting held recently.
At that held last Friday night sixteen new
members were initiated and seven applica
tions for admittance to tbe parlor were re
ceived.
Miss Ida Sperry, the president, has been
laboring hanl for the success of the cele
bration, and hay been ably assisted by
Mr?. Mamie Mantuey, Mrs. Lena Miils,
Mrs. Grace Willy, Mrs. Belle Stockwell,
Mis* Hannah Gray, Miss Clara S'.oir, Miss
Fiorilla Campbell, Miss Ida Safferhill,
Miss Zetta Kohlberg, Miss Louise Gallup
a.id Mrs. Rebecca McConnell. These have
been most prominent in performing the
work of the various committees, but many
others in tbe parlor have lent helping
hands and will come in for their share of
the praise when all is over.
Among these are: Miss Emma Hilke.
Miss Ida Biaisdell, Miss Annie Adams
Miss Jessie Harris, Miss Julia Weber, Miss
Minta Smith, Miss Lena Nevin, Miss
Eliza Watts, Miss Belle Laogier, Miss An
nie Black, Miss Carrie Whiting, Miss Jes
sie Thrift, Miss Grace Loveland, Miss
Emma Adams, Miss Winnie Smith, Mrs.
Baker, Mrs. B. Webber, Mrs. Mapes and
Mrs. M. Dorr. All will take part in enter
taining the visiting Natives at the bead
quarters in the Courthouse on the Bth,
9th and ICth. The headquarters will be
kept open until after midnight each night
during the festivities.
Th^- fair ones who belong to Joaquin
Parlor have done much to make the com
ing affair a great success. When they
participate in the street parade, with their
dude hats, white duck dresses and white
parasols, they will make a splendid show
ing. The parlor is one of the oldest in
the organization of Native Daughters.
Its charter officers were: Past president,
Mrs. Belle Stockwell; president, Miss
Hannah Gray; first vice-president, Mrs.
Althea Hickman-Dunlav; second vice
president. Miss Kate Abramsky; third
vice-president, Miss Nellie Austin; re

j cording secretary, Miss Enmi Debnam;
i financial secretary, Miss Belle Grunsky;
j treasurer, Albertina Hickman; marshal,
Carrie O'Brien; inside sentinel, Maggie
Davis; outside sentinel, Emma Abramsky.
From the date of its formation interest
has never flagged, and mauy of those wfco
i helped to organize the parlor are prom
i inent in arranging for the celebration of
I next week.
Grand Marshal Nutter has everything
in readiness for the parade on the morn
ing of the 9th, an i he has been ably as
sisted by Major Frank Lane in his efforts
to make the pageant a success. There will
be seven immense floats in the line, and
there will be ten divisions of Native Sons,
each iieaded by bands, and many of tbe
parlors will have drum corps besides. One
parlor alone will bring a drum corps of
twenty-six, the largest that has ever par
aded in line of march in this State.
This is one of the Sacramento parlors,
which will be joined in coming here by
; the Woodland parlor. They will be given
j prominent positions in the parade.
Chairman Burres of the parade commii
j tee has about finished his several floats
that are to be features of the procession.
There will be another parade here on the
evening of the Bth, when the visiting
; Natives who arrive on the nieht train
I from San Francisco will be met at the
i railway depot and escorted through the
i main streets and to their various bead
i quarters by a torchlight procession
headed by Stockton Parlor, with plenty
of music.
To-morrow Chairman Henry Adams of
! the press committee will have an opening
I at the headquarters of the committee in
I the Yosemite Theater building, to show
j the general committee what arrangements
have been made by him. He has been .
one of the most enthusiastic workers
throughout the entire affair, and among
other things has secured enough liquid
refreshments in the way of wines and
brandies to care for a regiment.
The general headquarters, where the
reception committee will take its stand to
wait upon the visiting natives, has been
gorgeously decorated and will present as
attractive an appearance as any head
quarters ever provided at any former cele
bration of the Native Sons.
Arthur H. Wright, Charles Hutchinson
and Robert Inglis have charge of tbe bi
cycle meet at Goodwater Grove, that is to
occupy the time between 1:30 and 3:30 on
the afternoon of the 9th. They are having
the track put into condition for record
breaking, and on Sunday will have the
fifteen-ton steam-road roller belonging to
tbe city at work on the track to make it
hard as a concrete course. This they will
be able to do, as the track is one of tbe
best in the State, and it will be strange if
some recorda do not go by the board on
the afternoon of Admission day. The fol
lowing have been selected by the commit
tee to act as track officials: Referee, San
ford Piummer; starter. George P. Wet

Conroy, A. P. Swain ; timers, R. C. Len

At 3:30 o'clock the regatta will begin.
The >ingle-scull events and one of the
races for outrigeer skirls will come first
and then will come the senior barge race,
whicn is looked forward to with so much
interest by every one in this city and by
many San Franciscans.
The minstrel show in the Yosemite
Theater to-uight for the benefit of ihe
carnival fund of the celebration was the
social event of the Beason in Stockton.
Never before in the history of the
Yosemite Theater was every sent, both ur>
Btairs and down, taken before the evening
ing the performance. This morning not a
seat could be haa for love or money. Even
the aisles were crowded to-night and if the
police would have allowed camp stools to
be used these would have said at a pre
mium.
First came the minstrel part, and it was
one of the Dest ever enacted by burnt-corfc
artists, even those in me professional line,
in Stockton. Followng is the complete
programme, from which some idea may
be gleaned of the care taken to make the
affair a success:
Minstrel first part.
Interlocutor â Frank H. Goula.

Lart<! and Major Frank E. Lane.

Grand Parisian ballet, Wtllerette Biglow
reene, premier danseuse, assisted by Misses
Daviserina. Karkeeks, Knhen, Yorkeen, Trilby
Davieerina, Melona and Vandettaeena.
This last number made one of the hits of
the evening, and in the ballet, as Van
dettaeena. were Justice yon Detten, who
weighs 230 pounds, and Carl Davis as Miss
Daviserina. who is 6 feet 4 inches in height.
The balance of the programme was as fol
lows:
Ira Ladd (the popular ballad singer), "Dream
of you". "The Black Uussarg." Captain Wil
liam Bruce, commander. Company AâSer
geants Doll, Morrell and Wollam; Corporals
Colberg, Woods, G. Kroeckel and H. S. Elliott-

Overture, waltz, "Robin Hood," Professor
Steele and orchestra.
The entertainment concluded with an
original farce without a plot, an act or a
laugh written hy Arthur Levinsky and
entitled, "The X ray." The cast was a
follows:
Prof egsor Good Thing a. L. Levinsky
Chain Ughtnlng Billy Bigeiow
I'm-a-Comin' Fred P. Clark
Ole Silurian Albert C. Parker
Present Hard limes Herbert de Lacuna
Just a Kicker. Ben W. Lewis
Future Good Times Eugene L. Wilhott
The Black Hussars made a great hit by
their fancy drilling. All were members
of the local militia companies and were
warmly applauded for their work. Paul
Eichelroth's imitation of Hermann's
trick of catching a bullet fired at his head
was also well received, and when the farce
written by Arthur Levinsky wasproduced
the audience was convulsed. The show
netted the carnival committee a hand
some sum.
Major Gus Grant, was the prime mover
in the affair and was largely instrumental
in making the entertainment the success
it proved to be.
J'irr at Salinas-
SALINAB, Cal., Sept. 2^â Fire broke out
at noon to-day in Uncapher's livery stable
on Main street. The building, a large two
story frame structure, was enveloped in
flumes before the fire department arrived.
The horses and carriages were all removed,
but the barn and the hay and grain it con
tained were destroyed. The loss to the
t'ncapher estate is $2000; insurance, $1000.
RIVAL GAMES OF
CHRIS AND SAM,
Buckley's Convention Will
Smoothly Register
His Will.
HOW THE SLATE READS.
But Sam Rainey Can't Make
His Work Smoothly and
Trouble Brews.
M'NAB HAS TROUBLES, TOO.
The Junta Campa gn Committee Fac
tions Are at War Over the Com
ing Convention.
To-night at B'nai B'rith Hall the
Buckley faction of the local Democracy
will hold the first session of its municipal
convention and begin the process of
framing the municipal ticket which will
be used as the basis of the legal contest to
determine which faction is, under the law,
entitled to the regular heading, "Demo
cratic," on the ballot.
At to-night's meeting the usual conven
tion committees and some extra ones will
be appointed. One committee will be ap
pointed to recommend nominations for
Supervisors and another committee will
be charged with reporting a ticket of
School Directors. The convention will
probably adjourn for twenty-four hours to
allow the platform committee a respecta
ble time to report the platform, which is
now ready for submission to the com
mittee.
Under the law the 13th inst. is the first
day when a party ticket may be filed with
the Registrar, who is required to accept or
reject it promptly. The Buckleyites will
have their ticket ready on that day. It
will be rejected by Mr. Hinton and a writ
of mandamus will be at once asked of the
Supreme Court by the committee of at
torneys which has charge of the case.
That delayed and daily expected Su
preme Court decision as to whether the
county officers in this City and county
hold their offices for four years injects a
feeling of uncertainty into the situation
all around, but the Buckleyites are going
vigorously ahead with the preparation of
a full ticket, and the big headquarters on
Ellis street are nightly crowded by aspir
ants for office and by the loyal "pu3h."
The executive committee met last even
ing, with M. J. Donovan ia the chair, and
canvassed the primary election returns,
and Christopher A. Buckley held his usual
rear-room levee.
The first kick against Buckley's author
ity developed last evening over the
making of James C. Neaion the chair
man of the convention. It was caused by
the sort of love and admiration with
which some BucKleyites regard Neaion, it
is true, but nevertheless it was a rebelli
ous thing to do. The ex-Assessor is an old
friend of Buckley's and has been promi
nent in the affairs of the faction. Buckley
decided to put him on the slate for chair
man and then kickers began trotting
quickly to Chris. Buckley wouldn't rub
Nealon's name off the slate and the kicks
began to float, around outside and to be
come threats to openly oppose Nealon's
election in the convention. Attorney
Charles J. Heggerty is one of the candi
dates of the anti-Nealon people. If Neaion
remains on the slate there may be some
fun over the chairm anship.
The slate is decided upon so far, as it
presents Dr. Stantou for Mayor, Fleet F.
Strother for Auditor, M. C. Haley for
County Clerk, Thomas J. Glynn for Re
corder, Colonel John O' Byrne for District
Attorney and W. F. Humphreys for City
and County Attorney, but some other of
fices are still awaiting decision. E. T.
Mills wants to be Tax Collector and is
much talked of for the office, but there are
others in the field. Thomas Ashworth,
who doesn't appear to have secured any
prominent place on the slate yet, is talked
of as a possible candidate for Treasurer.
Thomas J. Ford, the ex-School Director,
Is looked upon as the winner of the nomi
nation for Superintendent of Streets, but
John Morton.the contractor, Dauiel Sheer
in and others are pursuing it. The nomina
tion for County Surveyor will probably go
to either John M. Curtis or Charles Hol
coinb. There is a bit; crop of candidates
for Supervisors and School Directors.
When the retnrns from the Seventeenth
Senatorial District were canvassed last
night it was found that Thomas F. Egan
of the Twenty-ninth Assembly District
was credited with six votes more than hia
rival, "Larry" Buckley, of the Twenty
eighth District. In Egan's district eight
of the 975 votes cast had been found to be
mutilated and wore thrown out, giving
Egan 967, the entire vote. Buckley's
friends say that toe eight votes thrown
out were votes for Buckley, which some
how got past the Inspector. In the
Twenty-eighth Buckley's friends counted
only the 961 votes in the box, none of
which were !or Egan. As the only reason
Buckley's vote was not heavier was that
the supply of ballots gave out early and
many people were thus restricted in tneir
voting privileges it will be seen how a
fateful little accident may determine the
career of a statesman. Buckley filed a
contest last night and may proceed to kick
up trouble. His friends, who could not
provide ballots enough to give him the
nomination, could yesterday Hardly look
him in the face, although they were quite
used to it.
SAM RAINEY'S CONVENTION
The Junta Is tn a Row Over the
Way to Appoint It.
The municipal convention that Sam
Rainey and Gavin McNab are going to
operate alongside of Buckley's looms into
view about ten days distant and some
thing serious can be already seen to be the
matter with it.
Sam Rainey is understood to be a little
ashamed to display his convention along
side of that of his old partner. The con
vention that Chris has about fashioned
with the exception of appointing tbe
mover of adjournment at the end will be
"built like a watch" and run a smooth
course with a master for cnief engineer.
But Sam can't get the pesky thing to
work just right. He wiil control it along
with his new partner, Ed Lanigan. the
risine young boss, and will get the nomi
nations for patronage offices all right, but
there will be lots of hot journals and some
breakdowns.
The Junta people are expecting a merry
row to-night at the meeting of tbe cam
paign committee, when an effort to adopt
a plan and fix a time for the Junta munici
pal convention will be made. It is gener
ally agreed that the convention will be
called for either the 13th or 14th inst.
The Junta does not believe in primary
elections or in meetings of the general
committee. It is too ticklish a thing for
the bosses to let control out of their hands
for a few hours. The convention will be
composed of tne general committee of
450, to which a number of delegates at
large will be added. The naming of these
delegates at large involves power in the
convention, and as the Junta is torn up
into bitter factions the naming of these
additional delegates is a cause of trouble.
The campaign committee of twenty will
decide everything about the plan of the
convention. Boss McNab wants 200 at
large added. Rainey and Lanigan want
100. Another faction in the committee,
some times called the "anarchists" because
they will not be controlled by either Mc-
Nab or Rainey, want 150 appointed.
Rainey and Lanigan, though controlling
a majority of the General Committee,
have but four votes in the campaign com
mittee â Joseph P. Hayes, Captain Fitz
patrick, J. N. Much and Thomas Haskins.
McNab has himself, Chairman Sullivan,
M. C. Hassett, J. F. Butler, P. J. Harney.
A. A. Watkins, George T. Marye and T.
Donovan. Sam Braunhart has "been in
duced to leave the "anarchists" and sun
port the McNab programme, giving Mc-
Nab nine votes as the measure of dic
tatorial power he and Chairman Sullivan
can wield. The seven independents are
Secretary John F. McGovern, W. J. Gavi
gan, M. Tierney, Peter Quinn, J. O'Don
neli, R. L. Mann and George Love. No
faction has a majority and the constitu
tion requires fourteen affirmative votes
"to institute any nominating conven
tion." There is thus a probability that
the "anarchists" will compel a com
promise on their own plan to add 150 to
the 450.
McNab some time ago wanted the dele
gates at large named by the whole com
mittee that he might dictate a majority of
them, but now he has been forced to con
cede to each member of the committee
his pro rata share of the appointments.
The constitution prohibits any Federal,
State or municipal employe from sitting
as a member of a nominating convention,
and tbere are about seventy such inelig
ible members in the general committee.
Such members are to name their substi
tutes themselves. McNab and Sullivan
want these individual appointments sub
ject to confirmation by the campaign
committee and there may be a row over
thai.
Out of it all will come an appointed con
vention, in which Sam Rainey will get
about what he wants, tiving the other
factions some of the offices that there is
nothing in tor him.
MAGUIRE'S OWN MEETING.

W. T. Guesg, a Colored Man, Arrested
on Charges of Attempted Crimi
nal Assault.
Two charges of attempted criminal as
sault were booked at the City Prison last
night against W. T. Guess, a young col
ored man.
About ten days ago he called at the room
of Mrs. Edna Wallace, 15^ Turk street, a
manicure artist, pretending he had a note
for her. While she was adjusting her
spectacles he grabbed her by the throat
and threatened to kill her if she made a
noise. He attempted to assault her, but
she fought with him and finally succeeded
in getting away from him. She ran
screaming downstairs aud Guess made his
escape.
Two days ago he returned to the house
and made an attempt to assault Minnie
Morgan, who occupies a room adjoining
Mrs. Wallace's. Mrs. Wallace heard her
screams and ran to her assistance.
The police were notified, and last night
while the two women were with Detective
Ben Bohen on Market street they saw
Guess, and Bohen arrested him.

Ste zner Was Dazed in the Seventh
Round, but His Opponent Was Too
Weak to Knock Him Out.
The interest in sports pugilistic is evi
dently great, judging from the large gath
ering of people who witnessed the enter
tainment of the Colma Athletic Club last
evening at the Grove-street Theater.
Last Friday evening the Occidental Club
gave a fistic entertainment which was wit
nessed by 5000 people of divers classes of
society.
Captain Wittman stopped the first bout
of the evening in the second round. It
was to be a four-round bout between Gus
Longreen, a Swede, and Jack Hall of this
City.
The Swede was game, but his knowledge
of the art of self-defense was very meager,
and to save him from being cut to pieces
the captain ordered the bout stopped.
The second contest was a ten-round bout
between Billy Akers of this City and Lon
Aenew of St. Louis. The men weighed in
at 140 pounds. Agnew is quite a clever
fellow and impressed the knowing ones as
being a top notch of the class he repre
sents. He fought in a very cool and de
liberate manner and outgeneraled his
opponent in all points of the game.
The eighth round between Stelzner and
Peppers was tolerably interesting. Con
siderable wild slogging was indulged in,
yet Peppers, who was handicapped fifteen
pounds in weight, made a very good bat
tie and would certainly have whipped his
opponent in the seventh round, when the
latter was traveling on queer street from
the eff cts of a right-hand punch on the
jaw, had he possessed the necessary
strength to administer a knock-out dlow.
The figh's are given in rounds as follows:
Akers and Agnew:
First roundâ Akers, although a much
smaller man than his opponent, had all the
best of the round, forcing the pace and hitting
Agnew quite frequently with lett and right in
the face.
Second round â Agnew opened by planting
two heavy rights on Akers' jaw, but the latter
warmeil Agnew's neck with two heavy swing
ing rights immediately following. The round
was give and take until Agnew caught Akers
on the point oi the jaw and brougut him to
his knees. Akers was up quickly, but re
mained in a dazed condition until the end ot
the round. Agnew was fresh when the round
ended.
Third roundâ Agnew had all the best of it,
but he was unable to land on Akers' jaw be
cause of the clever ducking of the latter. It
looked very much like Agnew's fight, as
Akers poor condition commenced to tell on
him.
Fourth round â Akers' blows were very weak
and his mouth was bleeding freely from the
smashes he had received. Agnew wjs cer
; tainly holding a strong lead and fighting
I coolly and determinedly.
Fifth roundâ This settled Akers' hash. Ag
new timed his game well, and aftei delivering
to his opponent six straight left-hand blows in
the fnce and mouth Akers dropped to the floor
a whipped man. Akers was far from being in
condition for a hard tignt, but he battled
gamely and received quite an ovation when
he retired from the ring.
Henry Peppers of Los Angeles, weight
162 pounds, and Jack Stelzner of Chicago,
170 pounds, fought an eight-round con
test. Spider Kelly was behind Peppers
and Jimmy Carroll squired Stelzner. The
betting was $10 to $8 in favor of Stelzner.
The referee selected was Joe Choynski,
and he received great applause when he
made his appearance in the ring. The
master of ceremonies, Billy Jordan, said
that the contest was to be eight rounds,
with the privilege of one or two extra
rounds if occasion reqnired it.
First roundâ The game was give and take,
but Peppers caught Stelzner one or two leit
swings on the neck winch staggered the Chi
cago man. Stelzner came up with a rush near
the end of the round and kept Peppers back
by a good right uppercut on the chin.
Second roundâ Peppers played for Stelzner
to lead, with the object of crossing him with
his n^ht, but Stelzner was up to snuff and re
mained off and allowed Peppers to do the
leading. Some wild swings were indulged in
by both men, and Stelzner received a hearty
cheer because of iiis clever ducking. Peppers
was still waiting for a cross.
Third roundâ Stelzner got in a good right in
Peppers' stomach, and the latter showed signs
of distress for a second. He finally dashed at
Stelzner, and, swinging jnrild, he missed three
smashes at Ste\zner's head. There was con
siderable dancing and fiddling in this round
with few good blows landing. Honors were
about evenly divided.
Fourth roundâ Peppers feinted with the left
and landed a right swing on Stelzner's jaw.
Then some more fiddling and dancing result
ed, and finally Stelzner landed a right swing
on Peppers' breast. Peppers caught Stelzner a
bad smash in the stomach as the Chicago pu
gilist tried to reach Peppers' jaw with a left
swing. Stelzner landed two good rights in
Peppers' face just before the round ended.
Fifth roundâ Lots of fancy work indulged in
at long range before a biow was struck.
Stelzuer was ilrst to land a har.i right smash
on Peppers' jaw. then a hot mix up followed.
Peppers dropped Stelzner to the floor in a
sharp rally witn a right on the jaw, ami when
Stelzner came too he charged at Peppers and
knocked him d >wn with a right in the mouth.
It was give and take to the finish, both fighters
being well tired when the gong sounded.
Sixth roundâ The round was tame. The
pugilist? had bellows to mend and remained
off at good range until the sound for corners
came.
Seventh round â Stelzner came up fresh and
banged Peppers frequently, but the latter
caught Steizner a hard right swing on the
point of the chin and dazed him. Peppers
was too weak to knock S;elzner out when the
latter was all but gone. Stelzner finally came
to his senses and warded off his opponent until
the gong sounded the finish. This was the
most exciting bout of the eveniug.
The eighth and last found was tame in com
parison to the rounds that preceded it. The
pugilists fiddled around each other without
striking a blow until a minute before the gong
sounded, when Stelzner lauded a right swing
on Peppers' forehead.
The referee announced the contest a
draw, and the big crowd dispersed, appar
ently well satisfied with the evening.^ en
tertainment.
Among tne interested spectators were
Detective I. W. Lees, Chief Crowley and
two ladies, who said they were delighted
with the sports of fisticuffs.
GREEN AND TRACY.
Excellent Reason for Belief That
They Will Come Together In
This City Soon.
"Young Mitchell" is jubilant, for he has
at last managed to match two men who
he believes will put up a rattling good con
test. These two men are Tommy Tracy
and George Green, who are deemed to be
very evenly matched men by the sporting
profession.
At least there is excellent reason for be
lief that the new Occidental Club will
match the two men. Yesterday Manager
Hockins sent a telegram from Chicago
stating that Tracy would start for tlm
City as soon as a ticket was sent him.
Green is perfectly willing to sian articles'.
William Dailey said last evening that
arrangements for Tracy's transportation
would be made at once.
LOS ANGELES-INTO LAKE LINE.
Business Men Have Several Routes Under
Consideration.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Sept. 2.â There is
a settled conviction among the business
men of this city that the Salt Lake-Los
Angeles railroatl project is not only feasi
ble but an exceedingly important one.
The committee of the Merchants' and
Manufacturers' Association has several
routes under consideration. Bishop Tay
lor is supplying the information.
If this line is built to a connection with
the Southern California railway system at
Barstow it will be 440 miles long. " If built
to a connection with the Atlantic ana Pa
cific Raiiway &i Ludlow it will be 400
miles in length. If built to a connection
with the Nevada Southern at Manvel it
will be 315 miles long. Any of these con
nections w uld give access to Southern
California. The distance to Los Angeles
from Salt Lake by the several routes would
be:' Via Manvol, 8-J6 miles; via Morongo,
821 miles; via Ludlow, 817 miles; via. Bar
stow, t<o3 miles. T. c distance irom Salt
Lake to Los Angeles by the existing routes
over the Central Pacific Railway' via Og
den, Sacramento and Lathrop Is 1225
miles, so the saving in distance by the
new line would be about 400 miles.
The Parker Will Contest.
SAN JOSE. Cal., Sept. 2.â Judge Rey
nolds to-day denied the motion for a con
tinuance in the contest of the will of
George H. ParKer, deceased, and the work
oi selecting a jury was commenced. It was
stipulated in court that the depositions of
Clayton Elchn, Â£. D. Lathrop ana Jane

FOR PRESIDENTâ
WILLIAM McKINLEY, or Ohio
FOB TICF-PKMIDENT-
GARRET A. BOBART. of New Jersey
*XKCTION NOVEMBER S, 1896.
See the home industries at the Pavilion.
The Mechanics' Fair gives a local object
lesson on the need of protection.
The latest thing for the Popocrats to
dodge is the news from Vermont.
Every one who can afford it should see
the State Fair and learn what California
can do.
v Bryan draws crowds well enough, bnt
the news from Vermont shows that he
doesn't draw voters worth a cent.
The vast resources of California afford
abundant opportunities to industry, but it
takes a protective system to make the in
dustry profitable.
As Bryan refused to talk about the Ver
mont election, it seems he does occasion
ally have temporary aberrations into the
wisdom of silence.
Sacramento snows much and the -Me
chanics' Institute Fair shows much, but
tbe Stockton festival will show the best
products of the State.
What with the State Fair, tbe Me
chanics' Fair, the campaign and the prep
arations for Admission day all California
is active in every energy.
By the time the campaign is over Mr.
Watson will have ceased to regret that
Sewall would not pive way to him and let
him get on the ba:id-wairon.
The moral effect of the Vermont election
will be felt everywnere in ihe Union and
Democrats are now hoping Arkansas will
counteract it with an immoral effect.
The Indianapolis convention is not ex
pected to give the gold Democrats a plat
form to stand on but an air cushion to sit
as a change from the barbed wire fence.
The home industries displayed at the
State Fair and the Mechanics' Pavilion
are good object lessons for tbe cause of
protection as every one recognizes who
sees them.
There yet remains to be written some
explanation by the Democrats of how they
expect workingmen to profit by free silver
tinder a free-trade system that deprives
them of work.
Every workingman knows his work was
more steady and his wages better under
tbe Republican tariff than under Demo
cratic conditions, and for that reason they
will vote for McKinley.
That the farmers of Vermont clearly
anderstand tbe situation- is made evident
oy the way they voted, and there is no
ioubt that farmers in other parts of the
:ountry understand it equally well.
An American tariff is a tariff that yields
ibundant revenues to the Government
md protects American industry. Any
ather tariff is distinctly un-American, be
cause it is adverse to American welfare.
If Thomas V. Cator feels any interest in
nis chances to become United States Sena
!or he had better see to it that the Demo
:rats do not fuse tbe Populists into noth
ingness on the legislative tickets this year.
According to the Textile Manufacturers'
Tournal about 80 per cent of the textile
nachinery of the country is idle, and with
men a showing is it any wonder the
jeople have had hard times under Demo
rratic conditions?
The Republican movement is one that
Rill set the mills running, put money into
:irculation, give employment to labor
nake a home market for farm products
tnd break up everywhere the stagnation
vhich Democracy has brought upon the
:ountry.
Joseph Pulitzer recently told an inter
riewer: "There is not tho remotest shadow
Â»f a chance that free silver can ever be
some a reality in the United States with
â¢ut international agreement," and every
Â»ody knows that Pulitzer is a lightning
ralculator.
In their efforts to induce the Populists
o fuse with them iv the counties the
Democrats are playing the same trick as
n the Congressional districts. Wherever
here is a chance to win the Democrats
rill get in, and wherever the chances are
he other way the Populists will be al
owed to take them.
A study of the exhibits at tbe Pavilion
fill convince any intelligent man that all
California needs to establish her industrial
-rosperity is a protective system that will
nable her to develop her natural re
ources and manufacture her raw material
nder conditions that will permit the pay*
lent of the present high rate of wages and
ieid a profit to the producer.
COMMEECE DEMANDS IT.
For the first time sdicc the Civil War the
Jmi rican people have nitne.ssed the calami
tous consequences of full and unrestrained
Democratic control of the Government. It has
been a record of unparalleled incapacity, dis
honor and disaster. In administrative man
agement it has ruthlessly sacrificed hutiipeti
sable revenue, entailed an unceasing deficit,
eked out ordinary current expense* with bor
rowed money, piled vp the public debt by
jt6t,oQQ t m in time of peace, forced an adverse
balance of trade, kepi a perpetual menace
Imaging over the redemption fund, panned
American credit to alien syndicates and re
verted all the measures and results of success
t'"l RepuWean rule. In the broad effect of
its policy it has precipitated panic, blighted
industry and trade with prolonged depression,
closed factories, reduced work and wages,
halted enterprise and crippled American pro
duction uhile itiimtating foreign production
for the American market. Every considera
tion of public safety and individual interest
demands that the Government shall berescucd
from the hands of those who have shown
themselves incapable of conducting it with
out disaster at home and dishonor abroad,
and shall be restored to ihe party which for
thirty y ears administered it with vnequaled
success and prosperity. â JRepublican National
Platform.
Tbe above is a recital of facts and not a
declaration of principles. It is intended
to call public attention to tbe difference
in results accruing to the country under
Republican and under Democratic admin
istrations. The iramers of the Republi
can platform did not deem it necessary to
KO into detail, because every one knows
by sad experience the mistake that was
made when the Democratic party was per
mitted to lay its hands upon the machin
ery of the Government.
It is very true that the Democracy has
had only two years of unrestrained con
trol since ISCO, but in those two years it
folly demonstrated that it is utterly in
capable of grasping the meaning of the
principles of our Government. It is not
said nor is it claimed that tbe Democratic
party was willfully dishonest during the
two years that it was supreme in the exec?
utive and legislative departments of the
Government, but it is charged, and the
Democracy itself furnishes the proof, that
its management ot tbe public affairs of
the Nation for two years came very near
bankrupting every business enterprise in
the country, to say nothing of increasing
the public debt, including tbe interest
that tbe people are pledged to cay, by
over $500,000,000.
There is no politics in pointing out the
failure of tbe Democratic party to give the
country a wise and prosperous administra
tion. Business is not politics, but it makes
a good deal of difference to business what
kind of political principles are applied by
the Government in conducting the public
affairs of tbe people who do the business
of the country. Tbe suspension of busi
ness over tbe country and tbe euormous
loss to individuals thereby during the last
two years is the legitimate outcome of
blundering on the part of tbe Democracy.
At no time has President Cleveland been
able to meet tlie requirements of the pub
lic's demand upon the Government for
commercial safety and encouragement,
and hence commerce reduced its opera
lions to the minimum, not because there
was not enough business to do, nor be
cause there was a scarcity of money, but
commerce and money lost confidence in
the ability of the Democracy to give them
the needed protection.
It is for these reasons that the Republi
can platform recites the facts as they have
been proven by Democracy itself, and,
moreover, to call the attention to another
fact, whicn is that the Democracy's past
history dues not warrant commerce, in
dustry or agriculture in believing that it
would oe any different if that party were
intrusted with their affairs for another
term. Business cares nothing about poli
tics or men. but it does demand satis
fying assurance that it will have whatever
protection and safe conduct it may need
at the hands of the Government as it
moves up and down the channels of trade
and trafiic.
The Demo'ratic platform contains the en
tire free-trade declaration, which is to
cheapen everything, and on every stump Oiey
declare that free coinage will raise price*.
How we arc to have vrosperity by both raising
and reducing prices it a problem which only
Democratic statesmen can solve. The>; say
we need a change in our money system.
What xre need is v change of parties and poli
cies. We want a man M the White Jlouse
who will not viake it an academy of object
letmmt itor an experiment station, but who
nill vphold the long-tried policies of the
country. â Senator Lodge.
A GREAT EXHIBIT.
San Francisco's Industrial Exposition
is the best proof that could be submitted
of the variety of the products of Califor
nia. It would be a surprise to those who
are not already familiar with the facts to
know that there are articles on exhibition
in the exposition hall in variety so end
less as to suggest the thought that the
whole world had been drawn upon to fur
nish material for the display. Yet it is
true that there is not a product of field,
mountain, factory or shop there on exhi
bition that is not a native of California,
and the Californian who fails to ro and
see for himself will have but little idea of
the possibilities of his State in the ma
terials of trade, commerce and industry.
It will be admitted that the first pur
pose of exhibiting the various products of
the State in Exposition Hall is as Presi
dent Denicke said in his address of wel
come when the doors were thrown open,
"The object of this is thoroughly to ad
vertise Lome products and educate our
citizens in the various and many indus
tries of the State." Bat there is an edu
cational feature of the effort which is not
to be forgotten. As our own people come
to realize what opportunities California
offers to capital aud to homeseckers they
will grow enthusiastic and every one will
bceome an immigration agent, in so far as
his correspondence with friends outside
tbe State is concerned. Such efforts to
present the excellence of the State in
truth to the world by giving practical and
substantial evidence of its mighty and far
reaching advantages for profit ana pleas
ure Are deserving the gratitude of every
one who is interested in California's pros
perity.
The orator of the occasion, Mr. J. D.
Phelan, summed it all up when he said:
"Of cours*. before everything else, the
chief element in a city's prosperity must
be the profitable employment of her in
habitants, which means a market for their
productions at home or abroad." The raw
material would not avail the people any
thing without mill and factory to convert
it into mercnantable articles, nor can San
Francisco reach creat proportions as a
commercial ana financial center until in
dustrial enterprises are planted where raw
material may be most conveniently
reached. It is of no great consequence
where in the State capital erects factories
and mills, for as the State grows so grows
her own metropolis, San Francisco. Tne
State could not have business expansion
without San Francisco participating in it
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 3, 1896.
to her advantage, and so the gentlemen
wno bring together from year to year such
evidences of California's greatness as may
be seen in Exposition Hall are planting
seed that will grow and spread, and nil tbe
State will surely reap harvests of pros
perity. No one should fail to visit this
exhibit of California's wide range of
products. __^_________
Should the Populist candidate be elected he
v(, 'ild find himself face to face with a deficit,
with an empty treasury, with a dishonored
and discredited currency. The gap could not
be filled with silver. Tliey would have to turn
on the printing presses and flood the country
with an inflated paper currency. â Senator
Lodge. __________
FOR THE GOOD OF THE COUNTRY.
Said Major McKinley to a delegation of
West Virginia editors: "Nothing is of
greater moment to the welfare of the
country than the adoption of a policy
which will give to labor and capital con
stant employment with fair returns. But,
gentlemen, lying beneath all these, and
more important than all these, is tho
preservation of law and order â the reign
of domestic quiet. These are embraced in
the contention which ia upon us this year.
It is not merely the success of mdiv iduals
or party, but the flood of the country it
seeks, and it is in that spirit, animated
only by patriotic sentiment, that I wish
always to constantly speaJk and act."
Tne spirit of patriotism which moved
Major McKinley to thus address himself
to his West Virginia friends comes from a
love of right and truth which transcends
party and politics. "It is not the success
of individuals or party" that should stir
the people to action at this time. The
peace and welfare of the whole country is
threatened by a faction that aims at over
turning the basic principles of the Govern
ment and tne substitution for them of
something worse than those things which
the fathers of the Republic rebelled
against, and it behooves every patriot to
forget party in the Nation's struggle to
maintain itself upon the broad lines of
civil liberty which the founders of the
federation established when the Republic
was born.
It is as Major McKinley says. The Na
tion must have a policy which will give
labor and capital constant employment
with fair returns. It is a question of the
advancement of the people in ways that
shall be most conducive to their peace and
prosperity, and not a question of politi
cal advantage for party's sake. There is
broadness and deepness in such utter
ances as tbe visiting editors beard that
indicate a sincere desire to see tbe people
prosper and be happy. The preservation
of law and order is necessary to the pros
perity of the people, and therefore what
ever is calculated to incite to revolution or
set section against section and neighbor
against neighbor is an attack upon the
libeity as well as upon the business inter
ests of every citizen. For tnese reasons
Major McKinley says it Is the good of the
country and not the success of individuals
or party that should actuate the voter.
Four years ago our streets were fill of jobs
looking for men; now t fie streets are full of
men looking for jobs which have gone across
the ocean. Stop it. Put William McKinley
in potter and you will do it. The Republican
party never pulled any ont down. It believes
and always did believe M reaching out for all
classes and lifting them up into the glad sun
shine of American prosperity. â Senator
Thurston.
ALL TOE McKINLEY.
What is true of the workingroen of San
Francisco concerning tbe political issues
of the Presidential campaign is true no
doubt of wage-earners everywhere. Yes
terday's Call contained interviews with
quite a large number of San Francisco
representative wage- earners, and their
opinions are valuable as showing what
tbe sentiment is among that class of citi
zens, the more so because tcey are study
ing economics as they never did betore
and know exactly what they are talking
about.
William McMabon, a blacksmith, says:
"I am going to vote for McKinley. What
is more, nearly every laboring man in this
part of the City is going to do tbe same
thing."
August Gunnison, a machinist, says:
"I am for protection. We had better pay
under the McKinley bill than we have
ever bad since. When a man is able to
work twu-tlmds aa lons and get three
quarters as much under the Wilson bill as
he did under tbe McKinley bill you can
wager that he is going to vote for the
author of that bill."
Charles Hellwig, in the hardware trade,
says: "I want to see McKinley elected,
because we need better times, settled con
ditions, active business, public confidence,
protection for home industries, an Ameri
can policy of government for the benefit
of Americans, and McKinley promises
all these in his person and in his past
performances in public"
H. W. Baxter, iv the drug trade, says:
"I am pome to cast my first ballot for
McKinley. in my opinion hard times are
due wholly to free trade. Yes, free trade
has almost bankrupted the Nation. Pro
tection is needed by men engaged in all
branches of industry, from the farmer,
wool-raiser and hop-raiser to the mer
chant."
William J. Blair, a farmer of Dixon,
says: "Free trade has nearly ruined the
farmers. I know whereof I speak when I
say this. We cannot get nearly so much
for our crops as formerly, and everything
is in a fair way for utter desolation. 1
never saw a set of men so utterly in de
spair as the California farmers are to-day."
I. H. Ackerman, in the crockery trade,
says: "At the beginning of the campaign
I was an out and out Bryan man and be
lieved that In free silver only lay the wel
fare of the country. I arrived at these
conclusions without any forethought, but
am coming to tbe conclusion that after all
I shall vote for McKinley ana protection."
Charles Crewe, employed in the iron
trade, says: "I shall vote for McKinley
certainly. There are enough reasons why
I should vote for him and none wby I
should vote for Bryan."
William 11. Crosby, a copperplate print
er, says: â¢'Democratic tariff tinkering has
sent wages down, and free silver will cause
them to fair still lower. For myself I do
not want any 50-cent dollars, nor do I be
lieve that any workman does."
S. W. Latz, an all-round mechanic, says:
"I shall certainly vote for William McKin
ley and the policy of protection to Ameri
can libor. I have observed enough of the
course of affairs to know that free traders
not a good thing for the man who is com
pelled to labor for wages."
Thomas I). Phillips, a bookbinder, says:
"I am a McKinley man on the protection
issue. Protection has tbe tendency to keep
np wages and American free trade tends to
bring American wages down to tbe Eu
ropean level."
Nicholas J. Battecate, a coffee-packer,
says: "I am going to vote for McKinley,
for I can see clearly that ray Interest lies
in that way. The interest of all others
similarly situated â that is, men who de
pend on regular employment and a fair
rate oi pay for work performedâ it the
same as I find mine to be. The more we
import from Europe, or from any cheap
labor country, the worse off we shall oe."
LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
PROTECTION IN SWEDEN.
How Free Traders is That Country Were
Converted From Error.
September 1, 1890.
Editor San Francisco Call: Noticing that I am
quoted on page 10 of your worthy organ of
Republicanism of to-day aÂ« Â«aylag, speaking
of Sweden's light lor protection twelve years
ago, that "Protection won, Â»nd in three years
the country had 37 per cent more manufac
tories than they had before." The statement
is not quite correctly quoted, and as the Hon.
Stephen M. White and other Democratic wind
blowers may gee fit to make capital out of it,
by misrepresenting its meaning, I think for
the sake of tbe Republican party and In order
to prevent misunderstandings the statement
should be corrected.
As it is reported it is very inconsistent, as
any person, even those who have as little sense
and understanding as the majority of the
Democratic party, can readily see that it is an
utter impossibility ior any country or State to
Increase its manufactories by 37 per cent in
sucn a short period as tnree years. My state
ment was that protection won (when the sub
ject was agitated in Sweden twelve years ago)
and a protection policy was put into eflect
which was to last for a period of three years.
That after the expiration of the three years all
the free-traders had been converted into pro
tectionists, because tney were seeking for the
country's welfare and were not striving for
free trade to further party interests. A protec
tion policy was adjusted to last for a period of
ten years without a break, and to-day Sweden
has 37 per cent more factories and good times
are prevailing. Yours truly,
L. G. Schkoedir.
CALIFORNIA WINE TO THE PROOF.
A Gold Medal Given to a Vineyardibt of
Santa Clara County.
To ihe Editor of the San Francisco Callâ But:
Once again California wine has won honors in
Europe. The fourteenth annual exposition of
the Association for the Progress of Hygeine
has just closed at Brussels, and among com
petitors from all Europe and America Pierre
Klein of Santa Clara County has had the
honor of carrying off an award of the highest
class, the gold medal. It is alia surprise to
me, thuugti a very agreeable oae. I must say
that I never heard of the Brussels association
unii! last year, when my exhibit at Bordeaux
received "honorable mention," and this fact,
published in all the wine journals of Europe,
led the gentlemen of Brussels to write and ask
me to take part in this exposition, with the
result that you can see. P. Klein.

MUSIC AND MUSICIANS.
Is August a musical month? This question
is agitating the breasts of Parisian journalists.
August has been accused of being the most
sterile of all tbe months in the calendar in
musical achievements. Nothing good, from a
musical standpoint, can come out of August,
according to its detractors. August's defend
ers, however, say that the fault does not lie
with the month, but with railroaas and steam
boats, which take people out of town for tbe
summer cheap. Arthur Paugin has gone lov
ingly through the calendar, and has shown
that in days gone by famous works have been
produced from the Ist to the 31st of August.
On the Ist of August, 1752, Pergolesi'B "La
Serva Padrona" was first produced at the
Paris Opera; on the 2d of August, 1774,
Gluck's "Orphee" wai given to tne Parisian
public ; on the 3d of August a number of mas
terpieces have been given to the world in dif
ferent years. These include Rossini's "Wil
liam TelL" Evidently the fault is not with
August, bnt with tbe modern tendency to go
out of town during the eighth month of the
year.
Rosenthal's appearance in America this fail
will be the great musical event of the season.
No pianist ior some time has made a more
enormous success than this young artist has
made in London during the past year.
Moritz Rosenthal Is only 33 years of age, and
Moritz Roscnthal, the Famous Pianist, Who Will Tour America This Fall.
was born at Lemberg. He is an example of
the endurance of the prodigy, for as early as
his fourth year he played in public. In His
fourteenth year he accepted Liszt's invitation
to pay a visit to Weimar, where he stayed for
two years, afterward appearing in Paris and
H;. Petersburg, where he made a great sensa
tiOD. In 1888 he gave over a hundred recitals
in Ameiica, and since 1890 has been heard in
most European towns.
An opera-rate war is on in Italy and specta
tors are now admitted to some of the most
expensive houses at popular prices. The
papers have not spared the performers in con
sequence of the reduced rates, as the follow
ing from Italy shows: "For the revival of the
'Lucia' reserved seats in the orchestra were
only 2." cents, 20 cents for the parterre ana 10
for the amphitheater. We cannot say that
the cheap performance had artistic merit, but
Miss Fornari used her thread of a voice all
right, the tenor, Pratl, sang Donizetti's melo
dies with expression, and the bass, Allegri,
maintained the role well. As ior the con
ductor, he kept his musicians from losing tbe
beat, which is as much as one can expect for
ten cents. The success of 'Lucia' was io great
that the management was obliged to give a
second performance last night. So much the
better; one cannot give too much encourage
ment to cheap opera. You know beforehand
that whatever the performance is you'll be
sure of your moneys worth."
Dame Martha Schwerdtlein, the mature
neighbor of Marguerite, whom "Faust" has
rendered celebrated, Is furnishing a sensation
for the German papers at the time of the year
when authentic news languishes. A Berlin
newspaper was the lirst to spring < n the pub
lic the news that Dr. Nekisch had discovered
in a church at Padua the tomooi the Knight
Schwerdtlein, husband of the said Martha,
whose last salutations Mephistopheies carries
to her in "Faust." Several German news
papers forgot that in German schwerdtlein
signifies little sword, and Nekisch a practical
joker, and they fell into the snare laid for
them by the Berlin editor by seriously repro
ducing the astonlshi ng news. Finally, a more
wideawake journal exposed the pleasantry,
and now the duped editors are pretending
that they only spoke of Schwerdtleln's tomb
to amuse their readers, and that they were all
in the secret of the joke. Some people have not
believed them, and a lively discussion is going
on in the German press on the subject.
News comes from Bayreuth that the Swedish
singer, Mile. Ellen Gulbranson, has won a
brilliant and entirely unexpected success in
the role of the Valkyrie. People who were
present at the first periormance of the
"Valkyrie" in 1876 say that Gulbranson is not
inferior to Mme. Materna twenty years ago.
This is no flight praise, for Materna, endowed
with a marvelous talent for imitation, com
pletely reflected the intentions of Richard
Wagner, who taught her the Valkyrie role to
its smallest details. Materna did not sing a
note nor make a movement that had not been
approved of by the master. It is to be Hoped
that the reports of Gulbranson's talent are' not
exaggerated.
A new "Museum of Costumes" will soon be
opened at Berlin. It is the celebrated collec
tion of Baron Lipperheide, which is now to be
given to the pUDlic, and wnich is considered
the most complete In the world. ThÂ« collec
tion contains more than 800 tableaux ana
paintings as well as an immense quantity of
books and engravings bearing on historic
dress. The Berlin theaters will now have free
permission to copy the designs in the museum,
and it is expected that an era of historic ac
curacy in opera may result. At present there
is no institution which outrages all truth to
history so much as doe* grand opera all over
the world.
Was St. Cecilia a musician? This question is
being agitated by students f history, who in
these days do not shrink from challenging
reputations that have lasted for centuries. In
a pretty article on the subject, addressed to
St. Cecilia herself, Le Temps says: It is never
recorded that you loved our terrestrial music
you who for centuries have been tne patron
saint of musicians. One only reads In your
history that while the festal instruments were
sounding you sang for God alone in your
heart. You may have known nothing of our
music, but the more I study the text of your
history the more I find that it suffices to jus
tify your eminent and traditional reputation.
"You sang in your heart." The most profound
song, the most beautiful and the most worthy
of the name, is it not that of the heart?
In discussing whether St. Cecilia vas really
a musician Le Temps tells the following leg
end: It was painting, they say, wnicn toward
the end of the fifteenth century made you
famous, first in Flanders and then In Italy. A
hundred and fifty years after the death of your
greatest painter a traveler was following one
Sunday evening the road to Rome, your native
city. He entered a church which bore your
name. A solitary pries v was chanting vespers,
and from the organ-loft soft chirpings could
be heard. The pilgrim made Inquiries and
was toid that Uia birds were fed tnere, as in
an aviary, where night and day they sang in
your honor, and that tne parish being poor
you contented yourself with the services oi
these little musicians.
Edward A. MacDowell is spending his sum
mer vacation preparing his lectures for the
Columbia University. The only thing to be
regretted as regards his appointment is that
he will be unable to compose much this year,
as it is well known that he does most of his
creative work in the country in the summer.
The musical course at Columbia is to include
lectures by others besidea himself. He has
already asked several musical critics to co
operate with him by contributing a few lec
tures. One lecture will bear the strange title,
"How Music Affects Savages and Composers."
It was only a few months ago that Lassalle,
the eminent barytone, renounced the pomps
and vanities of an operatic life, in order to de
vote himself to commerce, for he is a flourish
ing manufacturer as well as a singer. But now
a grand revival of "The Flying Dutchman" is
to be given in Paris, and Lassalle has let him
self be tempted to sign for the performance.
When the theater takes hold of a man or

It was desired to honor the visit of the Czar

therefore, been decided to give the Russian

A USEFUL MISSES' GOWN.
All the fashionable features of ladies' gowns
are reproduced in misses' costumes. This
charming example is of pink and white silk.
with a bodice of white lace over pink Mlk.
The shoulder straps are of pink velvet. The
same model is used ior high-necked gowns;
the yoke beinic plain and incorporated in the
waist, is simply cut away for an evening gown.
The sleeves are in the new bishop shape, and
in the gown shown above are drawn up by
elastics to form a shorter puff. A charming
gown of blue serge had the full blouse of cash
menienna silk with shoulder straps of plain
colored velvet.
Another go-.vn of petunia boucle cloth had
trimmings of leaf-green miroir velvet.
A chestnut brown and green mixed goods

edged with beaver.
A mixed cloth in blue and black had the
plain yoke of blue velvet, with black satin
shoulder straps, belt and collar. Over the top
of this collar stood scallops of blue velvet,
which formed a frame for the face, suggestive

years ago, but nevertheless she is still a
serviceable ship. When the quarantine

station was established on Angel Island
the necessity for a hulk in which the
passengers' baggage and clothing could be
fumigated was at once apparent. The
Omaha was to have been turned over to
the Naval Reserve as a training ship, but
the Government considered that the quar
antine station nad the first call, so the
frigate was partly dismantled at Mare
Island and turned into a quarantine hulk.
After the interior had been cleared of all
obstacles the fumigation machinery was
put in position in the bold. Tanks, in
which passengers taken from a plague
ship can be bathed, were put in, and hot
air compartments for the fumigation of
clothing and general baggage. When
thoroughly equipped the Omaha was
towed to California City and is now an ad
junct to the United States Quarantine
Station, and should a steamer come here
with smallpox or yellow fever aboard the
once smart frigate would be turned into a
pesthouse.
The Omaha was built at Philadelphia,
Pa., in 1869 and was barkrigeed. Her
displacement is 2400 tons, length 250 feet
6 inches, extreme breadth 38 feet, draught
16 feet 6 inches. Her indicated horse
power was 935, and her speed was given in
1892 as 11 knots.. It is not so many years
ago since the old vessel flew an admiral's
pennant, and now her last days are to be
spent as a quarantine hulk at anchor off
California City.
The rush to Stockton by steamer on the

pay extra. She will leave at 7P. M. The
T. C. Walker has been chartered by Mis

tbe Norcross Company in the suits filed
acainst it by Fox et al.
It is claimed that the best interests of
the company were with the plaintiffs in
that famous case and that the board of
directors so knew, but that they willfully
employed W. H. H. Hart to wage legal
warfare against the best interests of the
company, and paid him $5000 out of the
funds of the company for so doing. The
directors and Hart are therefore sued for
the return of the money.
GOLD ON THE COLORADO,
Much Decomposed Quartz Being
Found That Is of Unusual
Richness.
Dan Murphy's Story of Frank Coombs'
Find on the Old Government
Trail.
Dan Murphy, the pioneer merchant and
postmaster of The Needles, on the Colo
rado River, is in the City. He says there
is great activity in gold mining on the
river, and that during the last few months
many, good discoveries have been made.
In consequence of this business is active,
and there is far more confidence mani
fested in every direction than formerly.
"Prospectors are getting out up v the
river in both California and Arizona," said
he. â¢ "Several strikes have been made of
decomposed quartz, some of it surprisingly
rich. One of the best strikes was made
recently by Frank Coombs, thirty miles up
the river on the Arizona side. A big
ledge of decomposed quartz was found
right on the old Government trail. Some
of the quartz ran $1000 a ton.
"Then over in the Bandburg district,
and about Providence Mountain and in
the country toward Vanderbilt, there have
been several good discoveries made. One
of these is a great strike made by Indians.
It is said to be a big thing.
"Since silver - mining closed down the
miners have been giving their attention to
gold. They . have found a great many
quartz veins, and on sampling them have
discovered they will pay. So there is a
general impetus to good mining, and it is
resulting in good to the country.
"There is so much of the country along
the Colorado that is unexplored that it
offers a great field for enterprising men
who have a knowledge of mining."
Mr. Murphy is here on a business trio.

SUPERVISORS ARE
STILL STRUGGLING
The Accused Eight File
Another Brief in
Defense.
PLEAD IT WAS AN ERROR
Claim That the Reduction in
Assessments Was Made in
Good Faith.
SO JUDGE SEAWELL DELAYS.
Attorney Dickinson Raises a Further
Point as to the Corrupt Inten
tion of His Clients.
It was expected that Judge Seawell
would this morning render his deci
sion as to the demurrers.interposed by the
Supervisors indicted by the Grand Jury
in connection with the reduction of the
tax assessments on the franchise of the
Spring Valley Water Works and other
corporations. His Honor had so an
nounced, but yesterday an additional
brief was filed by General J. H. Dickinson
presenting more reasons why the indict
ment should be dismissed. Judge Sea
well has not had time to thoroughly go
into thy subject-matter of the new brief,
and so the decision on the demurrers is
indefinitely postponed.
The legal points involved in tbe brief
hinge on the proposition that if the Super
visors were wrong in making the reduc
tions complained of it was simply an error
of judgment, and that the board is not
subject to prosecution for such a mistake.
The brief says:
It is alleged in the accusations against the
Supervisors that an application was made by
the Spring Valley Water Works for a reduction
of the assessment on the franchise from S2 -
500,000 to $1,500,000, and that the accused
Supervisors, willfully, knowingly and cor
ruptly, with intent to defraud the City of a
portion of Its revenue, reduced the assessment.
In all the counts it is alleged that the de
fendants with the Board of Equalization par
ticipated in the reduction, but it does not say
howâ whether by argument, force or intimida
tion, and no facts arc stated to show it was
done in an unlawful manner. The presump
tion of law is that it was done in a lawful
manner, the contrary not being shown.
General Dickinson claims in behalf of
the Supervisors:
That the accusations acknowledge that the
Board of Equalization had jurisdiction of tbe
question for tne reduction of the assessment
applied for.
That the action of the board in dealing with
the valuation of the property-lists on the roll
is based upon evidence wcich may be adduced
before the board.
That the accusations do not allege that the
board did not act upon the evidence before it.
That the order in the premises is conclusive
that It did not act upon such evidence as was
necessary.
That there is no allegation in the accusa
tions that the board did not examine on oath
the person or agent making the application
touching the value of the property of the com
panies named.
That there is no allegation that tne agent of
the applicants did not answer all questions
pertinent to the inquiry, and therefore the
presumption is that the applicants were exam
ined in accordance with the law.
That the Boarrl of Equalization, having jur
isdiction and having complied with the sec
tions of the Political Code respecting the
value of the property, its order was conclu
sive.
That jurisdiction to determine the issue in
volves the power to determine it erroneously.
That jurisdiction to determine the fact of
evidence involves the power to draw errone
ous conclusions irom it.
That as there was evidence before the board
in support of its findings it must be treated as
conclusive, notwithstanding the fact that
there was other evidence that might be re
garded as raising a court ict therewith.
And that the accusations are insufficient to
follow the language of the statute in such a
case as this.
The brief goes on to take issue with the
allegations of conspiracy in the accusation
and with other technical words and
phrases.
Judge Sewall says he will announce his
decision in the matter as soon as possible.

PERJURY CHARGED
AGAINST DEVOTO,
Said to Have Sworn Falsely
to Become a Bonds
man.
TALE OF AN AFFIDAVIT.
An Attorney's Statement Made
Under Oath Declared to Be
False.
SERIOUS RESULTS THREATENED
The Accused Hay Be Criminally
Prosecuted and His Disbarment
May Be Demanded.
According to the affidavit filed yesterday
with the clerk of Justice of the Peace
Cook, James A. Devoto, an attorney, has
been guilty of moral turpitude, making
him liable to disbarment, the crime of
perjury, laying himself open to prosecu
tion, and has seriously jeopardized the
interests of his client. These are the facts
alleged in the affidavit:
Luigi Gandolfo, about two months ago,
secured judgment against G. B. Arnia
nino for $24150, on a suit before Judge
Cook, babed on a claim for board and
lodging furnished defendant, food fur
nished his horse and storage provided
for his buggy. N. S. Wirt and E. Crisp
represented the plaintiff and James A.
Devoto the defendant.
Defendant filed a notice of appeal, and
his original bondsmen haying been un
able to justify on the appeal bond to the
satisfaction of the court and plaintiff,
Devoto offered to become a surety for his
client, an unusual thing, it is said, for an
attorney to do, and a proceeding that is
looked upon by members of the bar as be
ing hardly within the pale of professional
conduct, though there is no law or rule
against such a proceeding.
In justifying before Judge Cook, the
affidavit avers, Devoto took oath that he
owned certain personal property and also
two lots in Stockton, for which he paid
$250 each, title to which was in his name.
Gandolfo, it is averred, had his suspi
cion aroused over Devoto's action and had
his attorney make inquiry as to the truth
of Devoto's statement that he owned real
estate in Stockton. He was made suspi
cious, he says, by the fact that the ac
cused attorney was unable to describe his
real property otherwise than as being two
unimproved lots in Stockton, located near
the State Insane Asylum.

the Recorder and Assessor of San Foaquin
County relative to the matter, but their
replies were to the effect, says the affida
vit, that Devoto's name did not appear in
the records of that county as showing him
to be the owner of real property of any
kind.
Then to make sure that there was no
mistake in the matter a reputable firm of
searchers oi records was employed to ex
amine the records, and they sent back
word that there was no property on record
in the name of Devoto.
It was on the strength of this informa
tion that the affidavit was filed, and on
which will be based a motion to dismiss
the appeal. The motion will be made on
to-morrow.
It is stated by one of the plaintiff's attor
neys that criminal proceedings may grow
out of the matter, and that the attention
of the Bar Association may be called to
the matter with a view to bringing about
Devoto's disbarment.

PATRIOTISM, PROTECTION AND PROSPERITY
LOCAL GERMANS
FOR McKINLEY
A Club of Representative
Men Formed in This
City.
NOT SEEKERS FOR OFFICE
Protection to Home Industries Is
the Aim of Those Who
Have Organized.
K0 FALSE ISSUE FOR THEM
They Want Money That Carries Its
Faco Vaiue All Over the
Globe.
At Norman's hall on Bush street on
last Friday night there was organized a
Republican club in the interest of Major
William McKinley and the party of which
he is the standard-bearer. The organiza
tion has more than ordinary significance
from the fact that the German-American
citizeu is not a professional politician who
makes his voice heard on the eve of every
campaign. Quite the contrary. Seldom
if ever do those serene, thinking, business
people dabble in club politics. They as a
rule quietly discuss the issues of the party
campaign in their clubs and other places
of meeting, and from the exchange of
opinions and facts deduced come to an in
telligent conclusion such as the powers of
the most eloquent orators of the day can
not change.
The ciub just organized has for its offi
cers some of the very best representatives
of the German people in this City. Ali
are men of standing, not only among the
Germau-speaking people, but* with the en
lire mercantile community. And still
better, not one of them is looking for
public office. All are in business, ranking
in the higher planes of independence and
6elf-support.
Consequently, the officers who hare
agreed lo assist their countrymen in hon
oring the Republican nominee for Presi
dent of the United States, together with
the 484 others who signed the roll, have
done so because they believe from long
years of practical experience that the
theory advanced by Mr. Bryan and his
Populist twin brother is false and imprac
ticable from a business standpoint. And
when it comes to business honorable and
legitimate the German has no superior at
home or in foreign lands.
''Though the distinction "German" is
applied to the members', the wor i loses its
distinction where the duties and responsi
biliiiesofci 7 -enshi;) come in, and on this
subject no more tilting and appropriate
language can be found than that which
was made use of by Major William Mc-
Kinley in his greeting to the German-
Americans of Cleveland, Ohio, who called
upon him last Saturday at his home in
Canton. He said :
My fellow-citizens: It is with peculiar pleas
ure and satisfaction that 1 welcome this repre
sentative body of German-American citizens of
Cleveland and of Northern Ohio to the city of
Canton and my own home. I appreciate most
heartily yi.ur cull, which as a compliment to
myself I prize very highly, but more than all
and above all I value it as a significant ex
pression of your interest and zeal in the great
political camtsnig:i up^u wtaieb we have en
[Apflause.] The citizens of the United
have learned not only to respect, but to
depend upon thu Germans hs a great and po
ttin influence in our civilizationâ snfe and
steady in every emergency and patriotic In
every crisis. [Great applause.] Loving your
mother country as you do an affectionately
does not wean that you love your adopted
country less, out that you have hearts big
enough for the love of both. [Applause and
trios of "Good, good."] Transplanted in the
free soil of Ani'.'riea, German characteristics
strengthened our institutions and exer
cised both a salutary and wise iuflueuce in our
progress as a Na:.
Ix>ve oi Fatherland, that deep and noble
sentiment which has ever distinguished you,
means to our German citizens always love oi
America and her iree institutions and abso
lute aud unqualified devotion to every true
rican interest. [Great applause.] Re
bpect for law and order aud faithlul obedience
to constituted authorities have been distin
guishing traits of the Germans on both sides
oi the Atluntic, while hatred of wrong and op
pression has cnlled him to arms as quickly
from his farm on our Western prairies as from
las ancestral vineyard on the Rhine. His
torians have recorded in all its greatness the
strength and service of that German army
which rallied to the standard of liberty and
isnioii at the cail of Lincoln and enrolled in
its splendid history the imperishable names
of thousands who so nobly suffered and died
fur iheir imperiled country. [Great cheering ]
Kut no such sacrifice, honorable as it is, can
do justice to the services of those brave men,
nor can it estimate at it.> true value their firm
support of the Union in its moral effect upon
all our peopie. [Applause.]
Proudly can the oermau-American soldiers
point to their deeds of valor and Buffering in
that great war. Confidently can theyciaim
that ihey brought no shame upon the German
name and bore themselves upon the battle
fields of America as did the soldiers of Freder
ick and Blucher in the old wars and Yon
Moltke in the greatest European warn of re
tent years. [Great cheerine.] The Govern
ment appreciated their splendid services.
AVhen the news of the in\\ of Richmond
reached Washington the people assembled in
large numbers at the residence of the Secre
tary of Stnte. Responding to their call for *
speech, Mr. Stanton said: "I will now write
my glowing dispatches. What shall I tell the
King of Prussia?" He answered his own ques
tion with this glowing tribute to our German
citizens: "i wli tell him that the Germans
liave been as faithful to the Union standard as
liis excellent Minister, Barorl Gerolt, has been
constant in his friendship to the United
fctates." [Tremendous applause.]
And as it was then so it is now with the
German people of San Francisco. They
bring no shame to their names or tbe
name of thtir country. Industrious, law
abiding, tolerant of their neighbors' views,
i ociable, generous and warm-hearted, the
German has no superior as an American
citizen in his devotion to tbe flag and
restitutions of this Republic.
Major McKiniey indorses these views,
from his experience in the East. Here is
what he said of them on the occasion
; bove nientio.ned:
Bat, my fellow-citizens, it is of the German-
American iv peace that 1 would now speak
vative, industrious, stendy, sensible,
honest, fond of home and family, a good citi
Â»ioâand who could be fond of home and
i-imily and not be a good citizen? [Renewed
cheers and cries of "Hurrah for McKinley."]
Not deluded by false theories of liiiance.nor
misled by catch phrases of the campaign. As
ir: the cri.-is of the Civil War he was faithful
to the country and sustained the nag, so in
t very crisis since he had stood for the. honor
and integrity of the Government of the United
States, always standing opposed to inflation
and repudiation, nomaiter what the form or
Miture of the guise i:i which the spurious
lea were presented. [Applause.] More
than nnce in - ihe ciqse States during the strug
gle for the resumption of specie payments the
German-American vote turned the scale in
iavor of honest finance and tne Nation's
l lighted faith. The German citizens do not
lite either cheap men or cheap money. [Ap
j'uuse and cries of "You are right, they don't *] |
riu-v typify sturdy manhood in their own
lives and they insist upon sound money in
their own business. [Great o.neeriug.] It is
gratifying to every lover oi his country this
year to feel that the German-Americans "of the
Luited States are standing unitedly to-day for
protection to American industries, for protec
tion to American labor, in favor of doing our
work at home and by our American citizens.
[Enthusiastic applause ana cries of "Hurrah
tor McKinley."]
They are in favor of dollars worth 100 cents
each and for the National honor, breaking
with their old party associations because that
party under its new leadership is committed
to inflation and a disordered currency. [Great
cheering.] We welcome them all, both for
what they are and what they have done, and
bid our German fellow-citizens godspeed in
every new effort in the broad fields of business
and statesmanship, to. all of which they have
already contributed so much. [Applause.]
Gentlemen, I highly appreciate the honor oi
this call and the significance of it more than I
can find words to express, and it will give me
sincere pleasure to meet and greet each one
of you personally. [Great cheers and cries oi
"Hurrah for McKinley."]
Such words were the praise spoken by
one of the greatest citizens, Major William
McKinley, in regard to a people who here
tofore never forced themselves into tbe po
litical arena. The Republican people of
San Francisco have good cause to hail
with joy tne acquisition to the party of
progress, protection and prosperity of the
officers and members of the German-
American Republican Club.
The following officers have been elected :
President, Robert Wienecke; vice-presi
dents, F. M. Freund, Julius Meyer and H.
F. Maas; secretary, H. Veroni; treasurer,
William Plagemann. The following were
chosen as an enrolling committee: Charles
Samuels, editor of the Pan Francisco
Abend Poat; J. Butz, W. Koment, Oscar
Tolle and William Gehrke.
The club will meet again next Friday
evening at the same place, and expect to
have the roll Increased to 1000 members.
The executive committee will be ap
pointed by President Wienecke at the
next meeting, after which active cam
paign work will begin and be kept up with
vigor until the day of election.
WOMEN REPUBLICANS.
Rousing Meeting: of the State Cen-
tral Club.
The Woman's Republican State Central
Club held an enthusiastic meeting last
night in Justice Groezinger's courtroom.
Mrs. George E. Spencer, vice-president,
delivered an admirable address, reviewing
generally the political situation. Ad
dresses were also delivered by Louis B.
Solinsky, L. Guslave Schroder, D. Mayer
and Frank B. McÃeth.
Mr. Solinsky spoke on the campaign is
sues and pointed out how it was possible
to convert unbelievers to protection. Mr.
Schroder cited an object lesson showing
how Sweden had benefited under a system
that the Republicans were now trying to
get adopted. Mr. Mayer spoke on free
silver and protection, and Mr. McÃeth on
the laboring man and the mills, showing
that the working classes would be bene
fited as much by gold as by silver.
It was decided in future to have no sing
ing at the meetings unless of National
hymns, also that the club should give a
musical and literary entertainment of r
non-political character.

IN THE SHADOW
OF THE CAPITOL
Congressman McCall Says
McKinley Will Surely
Be Elected.
EVEN IN THE SOUTH.
Importance of Electing the Con
gressional Delega
tion.
VIEWS AS TO CALIFORNIA.
Individuals Should Sink Their Differ
ences and Pull Together for*
Success.
Hon. S. W. McCall, Congressman from
Vermont, who made such a telling speech
in behalf of sound money, protection and
good government at the Auditorium on
Tuesday evening, left last evening for
Portland, where he is scheduled for a
speech. He will move on north to Wash
ington, where he has dates for two
speeches; then he will turn Eastward over
the Northern Pacific.
Mr. McCall spent some time yesterday
at the Republican State Committee rooms
in the Palace riotei, and met a number of
the leaders of the party in this State, with
Whom he discussed the situation and com
pared notes. Mr. McCall has traveled
over a large part of the country and visit
ed many States since the opening of the
campaign, and he speaks with the utmost
confidence of the success of the Republi
can party next fall.
'Vermont," said Mr. McCall, "did what
I expected her to do when I left to come
West. She has piled up a bitrger Republi
can majority than ever. From what I
have seen," continued Mr. MeCr]
think McKiirley's election is practically
certain. Since leaving Vermont, where I
F. M. Freund, First Vice-President.
H. F. Mass, Third Vice-President.
opened the campaign, I have traveled
tnrough Michigan to lowa, through Ne
braska and Colorado to California. The
indications when I left Michigan pointed
to an enormous Republican majority. I
am safe, I think, in placing the figure at
"5,000. McKiniey will, I believe, carry
every Northern State east of the Missouri
River and several Southern States â West
Virginia, Maryland and Kentucky, for in
stance, with a fighting chance in some
others. This is from reports brought to
meâ l have not myself been in the South.
"Now as to California," said Mr. Mc-
Call, "the situation of the State, its his
tory and its industries are snch that it
certainly ought to go Republican with a
wide margin to spare. To be frank, how
ever, I fear that Republican chances are
somewhat impaired by the differences
that exist between leaders in the party.
So far as I have been able to observe the
State Central Committee ia doing excel
lent work and its officers from Chairman
McLauglilin down are making every ex
ertion to bring the party into line and to
bring out the vote. If the Republicans of
California will sirk personal differences
and will bend their energies toward the
election of Republican electors and legis
lators there could be no doubt of the
party's success. The election of Republi
can legislators is very important as they
will have the choosing of a United States
Senator.
"It is important also that this State
should send a full Republican Congres
sional delegation to Washington at the
next sitting of Congress. Of Mr. Loud of
tliis City Speaker Reed expressed his
opinion when he appointed him chairman
of the Postoffice committee. Hiselection,
lam glad to learn, is almost certain. Mr.
Hilbori has also made an excellent record
in Congress, and it would be a loss to the
California delegation if he were not sent
back.
"While it might seem too sanguine to
expect that Judge Maguire, the only Dem
ocrat in the delegation, should be de
feated I understand that there is a very
good prospect of electing Mr. O'Brien, the
Republican candidate. I hope that he
may succeed as well because lie is a good
man as that he is needed. I emphasize the
importance of electing Republicans to
Congress, because it is not enough that the
party have the executive in order that a
new revenue bill be passed. As I said be
fore the State committee is doing all that
is possible for it to do, and it should have
the active support of every Republican in
California."
Civil Service.
John R. Proctor, president of the Civil
Service Commission, ha 3 issued a printed
circular to be posted in the Custom-house,
calling attention to the provisions of the
civil service act prohibiting persons in the
public service from contributing, receiving
or soliciting political assessments. Presi
dent Proctor adds:
All employes connected witn this district are
hereby notified that they are under no obliga
tion whatever to make subscriptions for polit
ical or other purposes, and that tney will not
be molested or in any way discriminated
against lor failure to so subscribe.
COLONEL SHAW
TALKED FINANCE
Traveled Through the
Mountains With a Camp
ing Outfit.
HE MADE THINGS HOWL
Teaching Political Economy by
Object Lessons on Colored
Paper.
GOLD MINING IN OLD RUSSIA
X ndergart en Method of Explaining the
Financial Problem Was Very
Successful.
Colonel Henry G. Shaw of Stockton was
in the City yesterday. He has just returned
from a trip through Tuolumne and Cala
veras Counties. The Colonel is one of the
Republican speakers in this campaign and
employs original methods in holding the
attention of his audiences. He has had
great success thus far as a campaigner,
voters of all shades of partisan belief re
maining to hear his unique arguments on
the monetary issue, which are illustrated
by silk handkerchiefs, colored strips ol
paper, oyster-shells, pasteboard shadow
graphs and a tri-colorea parity umbrella.
These kindergarten lessons are more ef
fective' than figures in impressing upon
the average mind the dire effects of bilver
monometallism upon the country.
Colonel Shaw traveled along the mother
lode in his own conveyance, a wagon
drawn by two hordes. Upon each side of
the waÃ'on cover he displayed a portrait of
MoKi::ley, with the word 3, "Protection,
Sound Money and Prosperity." The ban
ners excited much interest along the
route.
"I developed a great deal of feeling as I
drove through the country," said Colonel
Shaw. "I met and passed all sorts of
people. Some were for Bryan and some
for McKinley, and home said they didn't
care which way the election went. I was
hooted, and cheered by turns. I found,
however, that the Republicans as a rule
are all as true as *teei to their party. I
met many Democrats who declared that
they intended this year to vote for Mc-
Kinley and Hobart. The gold miners of
California are not all silver men by any
means. They are beginning to under
stand how the 16 to 1 wave may affect
them and the light is breaking in on them
very fast.
â¢ They are taking alarm at the prospect
that should Bryan be elected their wages
wiil be paid in depreciated silver, while
their employers will sell at a premium the
gold which they are engaged in mining.
They also fear that a Populist-Democratic
victory would be only a long step toward
Government control of the gold mines,
when the Russian example would be fol
lowed in this country and a law would be
passed compelling the gold miners to sell
their product to the Government at a
price fixed by law. You may safely count
on a good Republican majority in the gold
mining counties of California this year."
THE TIDAL WAVE.
11 As Goes Vermont So Goes the
Union," Say They All.
"As poes Vermont so goe3 the TJrion,"
is the cry all along the Republican Jine. It
is not because Vermont went Republican,
for tbat is the way she is built, but it is
because she has rolled up the biggest Re
publican majority in her history and has
exceeded her record by 100 per cent.
This is the significant fact, showing that
the people of that loyal State are wide
awake and that they are not to be deluded
into giving the corrupt and incompetent
Democracy a chance to experiment with
the welfare of the country for four years
longer after tbe bungling administration
of that office-hungry party has well nigh
destroyed it.
A traveling man just arrived from the
East said last night in reply to a question
by ;i Call reporter: "The election in the
East is< ail one way. It is going to be so
much one way that we have almost ceased
to t:ilk about it. That way is the good
old Republican way for protection. Do
you suppose the people of the East are
such fools that they would let the Democ
racy operate upon this country for an
other four years?"
The State Central Committee is receiv
ing letters daily from all parts of the State
making the rao?t fluttering reports as to
the prospects. The masses of the people,
the farmers and the rest of the bone and
sinew, have had tÂ» sober second thought.
They havesÂ«en through the silver dust that
is being kicked up to cloud their vision by
the beela oi the same old Democratic
jucKnss, and they are not going to be fooled
again.
The Republican meetings are being
largely attended in all parts of the State.
On the occasion of Judge Carpenter's visit
to Fresno a few evenings ago, the Barton
Opera-house Was crowded from pit to
dome.
Letters were received from Cucamonga,
San Bernardino County, to the effect that
the monometallic craze is dying out, and
that a strong reaction has set in. Reports
from Riverside County received yesterday
state that Republican meetings are well
attended, and that many converts have
bpen made to RepubticJ'.iism.
N. H. Falk, a lumber merchant of
Arcata, Humboldt County, was seen at
the Grand Hotel last night. He said the
people of Humboldt County were en
thusiastic for McKinley and protection,
and that they would render a good ac
count of themselves on election day.
P. A. Buell, one ot the leading mer
chants of Stockton, said last night: "Pro
tection is the only issue before the people.
Stockton is a manufacturing town and its
manufacturers never have had any diffi
culty in noting enough silver and gold to
pay for their raw material and for their
labor. There Is plenty of money in the
country. All that is wanted is the oppor
tunity for its investment. Protection and
the ascendency of the Republican party
will uive that .opportunity. The people of
Stockton will not be likely to vote against
the material interests of their city. There
are a few silver men there, but the mono
metallic fever is dying away."
Hon. J. Frank Aldrich, Con-gressman
from Illinois, said last night tbat from
what he had seen in California, Oregon
and Washington he was confident that the
Pacific Coast would be solid for protection
and McKiniey. "Illinois and Minnesota,
in spite of what may be said to the con
trary, are safe for McKinley," he added.
YOUNG REPUBLICANS.
New Headquarters Selected on
Sutter and Kearny Streets.
The Young Men's Republican League
met in Justice Kerrigan's courtroom last
liight, President Frank K. Spencer in the
chair. After a general talk on tbe politi
cal situation the question of the new head
quarters for the league was discussed, and
it was decided to open them on Saturday
nipht, September 12, when a "high jinks"
will be held. The location selected is on
the corner of Satter and Kearny streets.
The drill corps of the league was put
through a number of evolutions in a tall
on Bush street, last night, by the new
commander. Dr. Clement. The corps will
soon be in a position to give a public ex
hibition of its proficiency.
ELECTION COMMISSIONERS
They Refuse to Receive Any More
Representatives.
The Board of Election Commissioners
at their meeting this morning received a
communication from Joseph Spear asking
that A. J. Morgenstern and A. Barnard
should be allowed to represent the Repub
lican Fourth Congressional District com
mittee before the Election Commission.
Morgenstern declared -that there was a
split in the party and that there were two
County committees, and he asked the
Election Commission to decide which was
the proper one.
Aiva Watt denied that there was any
split In the party. The infinitesimally
small faction represented by Morgenstern
was too dead to make a noise.
The board did not taKe any action on
the matter, and after that order of busi
ness had passed Block moved that the
board refuse to recognize any further rep
resentatives.
Cresweii, in the chair, ruled the motion
out of order, as that, order of business had
been passed. He said, however, that it
could be recpened on Â« -motion to go back
to the former orderof business.
The vote on the motion stood as follows:
Ayes, Block and Broderick; noes, Cres

LECKY ON FREE TRADE,
Some Handy Literature for the
Wise Men of the
Colleges.
Professor Moses of Berkeley Is Sup
plied With a Campaign
Document.
A few days ago a well-known and pro
gressive citizen of San Francisco had g
campaign card published on good Bristol
board. The following is printed in bold
letters on one side of the card:
FREE TRADE.
W. H. Lecky, the English historian (now an
M. P.), in his recently published work,
"democracy and Liberty," has this to say in
volume 2, chapter 8!
The other side of the card contains this
extract:
No fact is more conspicuous in the nine
teenth century than the strength of the reac
tion that has taken place against the free trade
or "laissez-faire" principles which within the
memory of men still living were almost com
pletely dominant in the more advanced econ
omical teaching of the world, and which
seemed likely in a few years to control all the
more civilized legislation. Whether we look
to the despotic monarchies or to the demo
cratic republicsâ whether we consider the
crowded populations of Europe or the thinly
scattered inhabitants of Australia or New Zea
landâthe same lesson may be learned.
N arly every where the old iree-trade doc
trine is a vanquished or a declining creed and
the chief disputes relate to the forms which
protection should take; to the degree* to
which it may be Wisely carried; to the advan
tage of establishing a preferential treatment
in favor of different parts of the same empire.
In England more thmi in any other great
country free trade holds its ground and it still
governs our commercial legislation. But Eng
land is very isolated, and if 1 read aright
; average educated opinion the doctrine lias
bec-Tiie something very different from the
confident enthusiastic evangel of Cobdei:. It
! has come to mean i ittle more than a conviction
that, if all nations agreed to adopt free trade,
it would be a benefit to the world as a whole,
though not to every part of it; that, though
protective duties are of great value in foster
ing the infancy of manufactures, they should
not be continued when these manulactures
have reached their maturity; thai free trade
is the manifest interest of a great commer
cial country which does not produce sufficient
food for its subsistence, while its ships may be
met on every sea and its inanutactuies might
a! most supply the world; that cheap raw ma
terials and cheap food are essential conditions
of English manuiacturing supremacy.â Lecky's
"Democracy and Liberty."
Cards of the foregoing type have been
freely distributed to the college professors
of the Pacific Coast. Special care was
taken that Professor Moses of Berkeley
should'receive a card. It was fancied by
the sender that Mr. Moses nad been one
of the most active apostles of free trade at
the Berkeley institution, and fearing that
he might have overlooked Lecky's last
observations the extract was forwarded.

THE ARCHBISHOP
TO BE THE FIRST,
His Grace Will Open the
Y. M. I. Course of
Lectures.
"LIBERTY" HIS TOPIC.
What the Central Lecture
Bureau Is Doing for
Catholics.
SOURCE OF INSTRUCTION
Each Branch of the Institute Must
Give a Discourse at Least
Once a Year.
The first lecture to be given under the
auspices of the Central Lecture Bureau of
the Young Men's Institute will be given
in Metropolitan Hall September 9. As a
fitting beginning of the work anticipated
by tbe bureau Archbishop Riordan will
deliver this lecture, and it is to be given
under the auspices of Pioneer Council No.
1, the first established branch of the insti
tute. The subject selected by the Arch
bishop is "Individual and Political Lib
erty." Past Grand President Frank J.
Kierce will act as presiding officer, and in
addition to the discourÃe by the distin
guished Bpeaker there will be musical and
literary numbers on this programme.
The third lecture will be given in Mis
sion Parlor Hall, on Seventeenth street,
under the auspices of Mission Council ]No.
3, on October 1. The lecturer on this occa
sion will be the Rev. Peter C. Yorke, and
he will speak on "What Catholics Do Not
Believe." As this lecture is intended for
people of the Mission district a hall in
thai neighborhood was chosen.
Father Yorke will deliver the second
lecture of the series in Vallejo, September
18, under the auspices of Vallejo Council
No. 13. For this discourse the able lec
turer has taken the subject: "The Pope
and the People."
It is expected by the bureau that Bishop
Montgomery will come here from Loa
Angeles and deliver lectures for the insti
tute. Besides it is proposed to send speak
ers to Los Angeles, and to have lecturers
change with those in Sacramento, Hum
boldt County, Stockton and San Jose.
The Central Lecture Bureau has been
permanently established, with offices in
the new headquarters of the Young Men's
Institute, in the Parrott building. Ac
cording to a new article of the constitution
each council of the institute must give at
least one lecture a year under direction of
the bureau, which selects the speaker and
the subject. â¢All these lectures are to be
free, but admission is restricted to those
having tickets issued by members of the
council under which each lecture is given.
An official bulletin has been issued by the
bureau to the officers and members of
councils. It contains the following:
We do not need to inform you of the attacks
which have been rnaHe during the past few
j-ears on our faith and on our society. These
attacks have been instigated by malice and
carried on by misrepresentation, calumny at.d
untruth. No matter how ridiculous they may
seem to us, we must remember that many of
our fellow-citizens are ready to believe them.
Their early training, their environment now,
their reading, makes them prone to swallow
any calumny, no matter how monstrous, which
is uttered against Catholicism. If these
calumnies are allowed to go unanswered, the
general public will come to believe that we
have no answer to make. They judge of us as
they judge of themselves. Whenever anything
is said derogatory to them, their institutions,
their characters, their homes, their families,
immediately they spring to the front to repel
these charges; and no one blames them. If a
man's character is worth anything to him, it
is surely worth defending.
The twelfth Grand Council ol the Y. M. I.
has determined that an organized effort shall
be made by our beloved order to counteract
tbe charges made against Catholicism in gen
eral and against the Y. M. I. in particular.
Therefore a plan has been adopted according
to which lectures shall be given under the
auspices of the institute in every council of
the jurisdiction. Means will be taken to an
swer every calumny as soon as it is uttered
and where it is uttered. Literature will be
distributed both for the instruction of the
mem burs of the institute and for distribution
to those who may have been evily affected by
the literature from the other side.
The worthy grand president has appointed
the following as members of the central lec
ture bureau: Two yearsâ Hon. J. F. Sullivan,
Rev. James McDonald, F. J. Kierce, John
Lynch. O.ie yearâ Key. P. C. Yorke, Major
James F. Smith, Thomas H. Fallon, J. C.
O'Donnell.
These appointments were dated June 17,
189(5, and on the following Monday the mem
bers named met at tne rooms of the Young
Men's Institute in this City, aud organized as
foHows: Rev. P. C. Yorke, president; F. J.
Kierce, vice-president; Johu E. Richards Jr.,
secretary; John O'Donnell, treasurer.
The first step after organization was to es
tablish local lecture bureaus in Los Angeles,
in Sacramento and in Virginia City. The ter
ritory distributed to these local bureaus was:
For Los Angeles, the diocese of Los Angeles;
for Sacramento, all of the diocese oi Sacra
mento lying in the State of California, and for
Virginia City, the State of Nevada.
The members of the local bureau of Los
Angeles are the Right Rev. George Montgom
ery and I. B. Dockweiler, both of whom are
empowered to select a third member. For the
local bureau of Sacramento the members are
the Right Rev. Thomas Grace and W. F
Gormeley. These gentlemen are also em
powered to select a third. For the State of,
Nevada the members of the local bureau are
Rev. Father Tubman and George D. Pyne.
these gentlemen also being empowered to se
lect a third member.
Aiter going into details of the design
and methods of the bureau, the com
munication closes as follows:
In conclusion, we ask you to strengthen our
arms to this srreut work to wiiich we have been
called. We believe that there is no work so
much required in these, our days; no work
which will bear such abundanr fruit for God
and country. By counsel, by co-operation, by
energy, by zeal, we all can have a share of it.
We ask you knowing that we will receive a
response for that counsel, that co-operation,
that energy and that zeal. Now, more than
ever, it is the duty of every Catholic to stand
up for the honor of his Church ; and now, more
than ever, it is the auty oi every member of
the Young Men's Institute to work heart and
soul for the good of the institute. Yours sin
cerely, Jkter C. Yokke. President.

Winthrop.
HIS STRUGGLE FOR LIBERTY.
Handcuffed, Gagg-d and Chained to His \
B:d, He Says He Would Not
Be Blackmailed.
The Inking of testimony in the case of
Oliver W. Winthrop, accused of having
kidnaped and robbed in August last
.lames O. Campbell, the aged millionaire
of Hawaii, was begun yesterday before
Judge Wallace and a jury in department
ti. Superior Court. During nearly all the
time of the session the crowd of spec
tators present was entertained by the old
capitalist, who told Â« strange story of vio
ifiice, robbery and attempted extortion.
He went fully into the details of his
thrilling adventure, and his language and
manner were well calculated to impress
the jury with its truth.
Assistant District Attorney Biack. at
the opening of the morning session, said
that when Winthrop rented the cottage
at 4109 California street he aore a mus
tache but not side whiskers, as he had
erroneously stated on Tuesday.
Policeman G. W. Russell, the first wit
ness for the prosecution, exhibited and
explained a diagram be bad made, show
ing the exterior and interior of tne Califor
liia-street cottage, where the millionaire
waged such a plucty battle lor the pos
session of his wealth. The cottage fronted
|'n California street, and was between
Third ana Fourth avenups. In the base
ment were a kitchen, dining-room and
conservatory, and on the floor above a
parlor and three bedrooms.
Campbell was on tiie stand ihe rest of
the day under direct and cross examina
tion. His tale does not differ essentially
from that publis ed in the paper* at the
time, Out it was related more in detaii anil
with a most convincing air of sincerity
In substance he said:
"1 am 68 years of age, a carpenter by
trade. My home is in Honolulu, where
I've resided for forty-six year 1 -. My busi
ness has been that of a sugar-planter
and stock- raiser. For the last five years
I've been out of active business, though I
Blill retain my interest in several island
enterprises. I began life there as a car
penter, then went into the woods and
made Â« sugar-mill to grind out sugar. I
t\ as married eighteen years ago.
'In April last I came irom Honolulu to
San Francisco.
"1 first met Winthrop at the Venciome
Hotel In San Jose, where I was visiting: on
the 31-t of August. He introduced him
self to me under a false name, said he
wirhed to go to the islands .and inquired j
Campbell Explains How He Was Handcuffed.
concerning the coffee lands there. He
said that he had $70,000, realized from the
sale of v 'anch.and was desirous o: invest
ing the money In the islands. I advised
him to go down there and see things for
himself. He said he should were it not lor'
\he bad health of his wife, whom he would
like me to visit and enlighten her abottt
the climate. I answered that in n few |
days I should be in San Francisco and i
then, if time permitted, I would call on
lier.
"My next meeting with Wintbrop was
in the afternoon of Monday, August 3, in
ttie Occidental Hotel in "this City. H*
wished me to accompany him. but I was \
on my way to the Anglo-CaliforniaM Bank |
to draw some money and told him 1 hul :
iot the time. After returning to tiie j
ziotel I again sayv W nthrop and at his
pressing solicitation walked "down Mont- j
goraery street with him, took the Sacra- J
njento-street car and finally arrived at tuc |
cottage on California street. I had in my j
Winthrop and His Wife Sat a Few Feet Apart During the Trial
pockets the ?250 I had drawn from the
bank, $55 in bills and some loose change.
The carfare on the way oiu was paid by
Winthrop. We sat down in the parlor
and in a few minutes I inquired of Win
throp for his wife, explaining that I was
in a hurry. He said be would see and
left the room, returning without her, but
saying that she would come soon.
"While waitine there with my bat on,
but prepared to take it off as soon as the
lady should come, a masked man sud
denly appeared in the doorway, with a
pistol in his hand, and commanded me to
throw up my hands or he would shoot.
Winthrop put up his hands and advised
me to do so also, but I struck the masked
man a blow in the head with my clencned
fist, and ne went down. At the same in
stant the pistol went off and the ball
crazed my temple and passed through the
brim of my hat. I tried to grab the pis
tol, when Winthrop hit me from behind,
telling the man on the loor, whom he
called Pete, to bold on to the pistol. I
next attempted to cot out of the house
and had the front door partly open, when
Winthrop again attacked me, hitting me
with some hard substance behind the
ear and knocking me insensible."
The rest of the witness' testimony was a
recital of how he had been tied hand and
foot and his money taken from him by
Pete, as directed by Winthrop. Subse
quently he was gagged and handcuffed,
stretched upon a bedstead and chained to
staples in the floor. In this tortured and
half-starved condition, he said, his ab
ductors made repeated attempts to get
him to sign a paper which would enable
them to get $20,000 of his money, but he
stoutly resisted until finally he was re
leased. The chain with a split link, the
capitalist's torn frock coat, the handcuffs,
a rat-tail file and the bloodstained bed
clothes were introduced in evidence, and
proved to be convincing though silent wit
nesses.
"When on Wednesday Winthrop told
me that he had ordered Pete to set me
tree," said Campbell, 'he advised me in
the future never to make friends with
strangers. My pocketbook, letter of credit
and keys were returned to me, but not the
money. At about 8:30 p. m. Wednesday
Pete led me out the back door and put me
aboard of a Geary-street car. I walked
from the terminus to my hotel, sent for
Captain Lees and Detective Curtin and
went with them in a carriage back to the
cottage that same night. Winthrop aoes
not look now as he div when I saw him at
the cottage. He has shaved off his mus
tache."
Attorney Bell had begun to cross-exam
ine the witness when the court adjourned
until 10 o'clock this morning.
THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 3, 1896.
VERY COLD FROST
PREVENTS FUSION,
: Recess for Meditation by
i the Three-Headed
Committee.
ALL EYES ON THE THIRD
After the Democrats Nominate
the Fusionists Will Do
Something.
JOY OF THE EAILROAD MEN.
Government Ownership of Public
Utilities Will Not Be an Issue
in the Campaign.
The joint fusion committee of Demo- j
crats, Populists and silver men have found
that the world is not going well with
them. Tne refusal of Monteith and Me- j
Glashan, Populists, and of Kelly and Mad
dux, Democrats, to withdraw hasdiscon
certed them very much, for it has dig- j
arranged the slate materially.
The Democrats will not be able to de
liver the goods in the districts represented
by KelJy and Maddux, and the Populists
will not be able to keep their agreement j
with tne Democrats in the districts repre- }
sented by Monteith and McGlasbau. The
defection of the four candidates, however,
will be a good excuse for the Democracy
failing to keep ita promise to the Popu
lists, that it would give them three Con- j
gres smeu, and it now looks as if all the I
Populists would get would be two, and â 
those two in strong Republican districts j
where there is uoi the remotest chance of
winning.
The shrewd Democratic managers would j
rather put up a Populist to be sfaughtered :
in a Republican district than a Democrat,
because in that event tbe loss of prestige |
would tail upon the People's party and not
upon the Democratic party.
Tiie whole object of the fusion on the
Democratic side is to obtain the support
of the Populists of California for as many
Democratic Congressmen as possible. The
Southern Pacific Company is helping the
fnsionists by insisting that Monteith shall
be kept out of the light, because Monteith
has fought that company and Collis P.
Huntington most bitterly on behalf of the
railroad strikers.
It is, also, in an underhanded way,
through paid agents, keeping up the silver
craze among the Populists, whose politi
cal belief, most inconsistently, is fiat
money and who have stultified themselves
in the mad rush for office, thus showing
that they are no more unselfish or purer
of motive than the corrupt parties of j
which their orators are in tbe habit oi
speaking. Another reason why the South
era Pacific Company is desirous of keep
ing the silver madness among the Popu
lists at its height is because the Govern
ment ownership and management of rail
roads will not be made an issue during
this campaign.
Fiatism, direct legislation, proportional |
repiesentation, the initiative and toe refer- '
endum, Government ownership of public
utilities â all those important principles !
lor which Populism is struggling â have
oeen cast abide under the hypnotic spell of
Senator Stewart, a millionaire and a
grinder of the faces of the poor in their
own sweat and in the lust for office.
To the Populists the Democratic Con
i gressmen are pledged only for the free
I coinage of silver. No Democratic Con-
I gressman will vote for any of those prin- j
cipies of which they are so proud.
The leaders of the People's party of tbis ]
' State are not at all in touch with the great !
mass of their constituents. This tact is j
clearly shown by the altitude of nine- I
tenths of the Populist organs, which are ,
opposed to sacrificing the principles of
the party, even lor a temporary political
advantage.
T. V. Cator, the People's party nominee !
I for United States Senator from California, j
! has fallen very much in popularity. He
seems at present to be more interested in
and more closely connected with the Sil
i ver party than he is with the People's .
| party. But he says that he should not be J
! singled out, for John S. Dore advocated ,'
i the nomination of Bryan in the St. Louis '
convention, and he does not see why Mr. j
Dore should not bear a part of the burden
j upon his broad.sboulders.
The fusion committee resumed its con
! ference at 11 o'clock yesterday morning, I
j and after talking over the puzzling matter j
I adjourned until next Saturday afternoon '
lat 1 o'clock. They passed a resolution to j
the effect that they believed it would be
no more than equal justice ;o all the can- â 
didates to wait until after the Democrats
â¢ made their nominations in the Third Con- !
gressional District next Friday, and that
j they therefore would not proceed with the <
final consideration of the claims of any
candidate until then.
The Democrats and Silver men seem to
have the People's party State Central
Committee at their mercy in those fusion
attempts. Not one of the Populist com
ruitteemen will say anything on the sub
ject to reporter*, and they are preserving
a secrecy which would be mysterious were
it not so ridiculously ineffective.
Trouble is Breeding in the Third Dis
trict. W. A. Vann is the Populist nomi
nee there, and three-fourths of the district
convention which noruinntedhim say that
he will not be permitted to withdraw
uncier any circumstances and that he must
be made the fusion candidate. If the
fusionists decide upon any other person
they wiil run Mr. Vann as an independent
candidate.
M. F. Tarpey, ex-Democratic National
Committeeman, and Warren English are
candidates for the Democratic nomination
for Congress from the Third District.
Kach is strong and influential in his party
and whichever one of them shall be nomi
nated Will in all likelihood be the fusion
candidate. The district is one of the most
important in the State and it will not be
placed in the hands of a Populist.
Senator H. C. Gesford, Mr. Caminetti's
successor on the fusion committee, was
appointed with W. P. Lawlor and L. M.
Landsborough as a committee to formu
late a report which the conference com
mittee at the close of its deliberations
shall make to the State Central Commit
tees of the Democratic. Populist and Sil
ver parties.

SOUTHERN SUFFRAGISTS.
Miss Hay and Mrs. Holbrook-
Blinn Charmed With
Their Visit.
Efficient Methods, Able Officers and
Willing. Workers Seem to
Fresage Success.
Delighted with their trip, Miss Mary G.
Hay and Mrs. Nellie Holbrook-Biinn re
turned yesterday from their labors in the
woman suffrage cause in the southern
portion of the State.
'â¢We had a truly glorious time," com
mented Miss Hay shortly after her arrival.
"I was delighted to observe the ardent
devotion to the cause displayed by the
women of Southern California. As State
organizer it was incumbent upon me to
note the progress of the work in every
section of the State, and I tooK Mrs. Hol
brook-Blinn along with me as a valued
aid.
"While the organization of the cam
paign work throughout the south seems
simply perfect, I was most impressed by
the magnificent system and order whicb
characterizes the work in Los Angeles.
Our arrival there was unannounced and
unexpected, but we did not catch our
faithful workers napping. We found the
precinct organization of tbe city and its
vicinity admirable in its efficiency. The
officers are earnest, devoted ladies of the
highest social rank, while thousands of
willing, tireless workers render them able
and unfailing support and assistance."
Mrs. Holbrook-Blinn also expressed her
self as charmed with what she had seen in
Southern California and its metropolis.
"Invitations just rained in upon us,"
she remarked, "and we found it physi
cally impossible to accept a tenth of them.
Still we were kept busy. On Monday
morning we attended a meeting of the
city executive committee at the magnifi
cent headquarters in the Muskegan block.
Tho order and harmony which distin
guished the gathering impressed me most
powerfully, in th 6 aiternoon there was
an immense mass-meeting, held under
the auspices of the general city com
mittee, wnich comprises several hundred
ladies well known in social circles.
"In the evening there was a parlor meet
ing at the elegant home of Mrs. Fay on
Orange street, at which we addressed"sev
eral hundred persons and converted two
or three scores of voters, if rumor be cor
rect. On Tuesday forenoon we had a
drive through the city and its environs,
after which we had lunch with Mrs. Alice
Moore-McComas, Mrs. Maynard and Mrs.
Ludlumâ charming ladies and redhot suf
fragists, tbe three oi them. Then we took
tbe afternoon train for home and here we
are."
To-day Mrs. Naomi Anderson, the col
ored suffragist orator, who has been doing
abie work among voters of her race in and
about Fresno, is expected to arrive here.
She writes that she rinds joy and encour
aeemeut in her work and is ready to con
tinue it wherever the State committee
may decide to send her.
Tbis evening the committee will hold
one of its pleasant "at homes" in its ele
gant headquarters in the Parrott building.
The commodious rooms are being taste
fully and elaborately decorated for the
occasion, and if to-night's reception equals
that of a lortnicht ago it will be a most
enjoyable event.

Interpreter, Under
Indictment.
WAS WILLIAMS' FEIEND.
Now Charged With the Grave
Offense of Subornation
of Perjury.
A CHINESE GIRL IN THE CASF.
Woes of a Celestial Maiden Who
Sought to Land Hare for
Immoral Purposes.
Louie Quong, the Chinese interpreter
now under suspension and incidentally
the side partner of Dick Williams, was
indicted by the United.States Grand Jury
last Saturday on a charge of subornation
of perjury. A similar charge against Wil
liams was dismissed because of insuffi
cient proof.
The Grand Jury has not yet signed the
indictment, but the paper will be drawn
up by Assistant United States Attorney
Sculessinger to-day and submitted to the
jury for formal acceptance and return at
to-morrow's session.
The indictment of Louie Quong is but
another end to the so-called Cus
tom-house scandal. The particular
crime alleged against the Chinese
is found in the case of Dong Sun
Yep, a pretty Chinese maiden of 18 sum
mers. According to the complaint now
on file Quong will find his time pretty
well occupied in satisfactorily explaining
the allegations.
It appears that some months ago Dong
Sun Yet arrived from Hongkong. Her
credentials were not strictly first class and
she was consequently held pending inves
tigation. The girl was erdered to the
Chinese Mission, Louie Quong being
specially delegated to give her safe escort.
Some weeks later the habeas corpus pro
ceedings occurred before Commissioner
Heacock, with the result that the girl was
refused a landing. Certain proof, along
with pictures, wa s produced at the time
tending to show that Dong Sun Yet was a
native-born. She swore the photographs
submitted had been taken in Hongkong,
and this testimony was tacitly corrobo
rated by Louie Quong.
In spite of this evidence, however, Dong
Yet was ordered returned to China, but
the Government detained her here pend
ing a further investigation of the case as
far as it related to the testimony of Quong
and others.
The local Federal authorities began a
systematic review of the case, with the re
sult that the United States Grand Jury
has decided to return an indictment
against Louie Quong for subornation of
perjury, it was shown that when Quong
escorted Dong Sun Yet to the Chinese Mis
sion he did not go directly to that place
Instead, be stopped at a photographer's
establishment and bad the picture of his
fair countrywoman taken. It was this
picture which was produced before Com
missioner Heacock and sworn to as hav
ing been taken in Hongkong. Quong, un
der oath, stated that he had never had the
girl photographed.
But it seems that Dong Sun Yet re
pented of all tbis deception. She has
made a full confession that the picture
was taken in this City and that, too, at
the instigation of Louie Quong. The girl
further says that while she was in the
photograph gallery Williams came in and
was at least indirectly connected with the
proposed fraud. As corroborative of the
nictnre and of the story an expert
photographer was before the Grand Jury
and swore positively that the likeness had j
been taken in San Francisco, or rather !
that it was an American production.
Incidentally it may be remarked that I
Dong Sun Yet also confessed she had been J
brought to this country to be sold as a |
slave for immoral purposes. The photo
graph taken at the request of Louie Quong
was to have served a double purpose.
First it was to be used in the fraud at
tempted on the Government ar>d then
displayed to the Chinese slave-buyers.
On this latter opinion would depend her
money value for the purposes desired.
Volunteers of America.
Arrangements are now being made for the
reception of Mrs. Ballington Booth, wbo will

THE EXPOSITION

Thousands Visit the Annual
Fair of Mechanics'
Institute.
EXHIBITS ALL ARTISTIC

Fully and Handsomely
Illustrated.
PROGRAMME FOR TO-NIGHT.
Scottish Clans and Scottish Thistle
Ciub Will Attend the Expo
sition in Force.
The second day of the Mechanics' Insti
tute and Manufacturers' and Producers'
Exposition was all that fancy could dic
tate or heart desire. The exhibits are now
pretty nearly all in, and the late comers
One Corner of the Mechanics' Exposition Which Attracts Hundreds of Sightseers.
seem to have profited by the beautiful cre
ations of those earlier on the grounds.
There is a noticeable and appreciated lack
of vendors of the chewing gum, popcorn
and peanut variety, but on tie other hand
there are scores of pretty white-capped
and daintily dressed girls anxious to give
away all manner of good things, liquia or
solid, to whosoever will accept.
The attendance yesterday exceeded by
several hundred that of the opening day.
From 2 o'clock until tbe closing hour last
night the Pavilion was comfortably filled.
In the afternoon hundreds of ladies roamed
through the vast building, at times giving
audible expression to the artistic creations
which met their gaze at every turn. There
are more exhibitors this year than ever
before in the history of the institution. In
fact, the demand for space could not be
met, it being necessary to refuse some
sixty applicants.
The exhibit of W. P. Fuller & Co. is one
of the handsomest ever seen in Califor
nia. The two side walls are solid plate
glass mirrors, the largest ever manufac- j
tured in this country. Above each mirror
is a row of colored electric lights extend- I
ing all the way to the two entrance places.
Inside the booth a y>erfect blaze of many
colored lights reflected by cut-glass mi'r- |
rors meets the gaze. The effect isdazzliiig
and artistic in the extreme.
One of the novel and attractive features
of the exposition is a creation in soapâ an
artistically designed triumphal arch, fif
teen ton 3of Queen Lily soap being used in
its construction. The cornices are done in
soap and the floor a mosaic of small soap
squares. Around the whole runs a chain j
ol soap balls and inside the house colored
electric lights are to be seen.
There are hundreds of other booths just
as attractive in their way as those already
enumerated, and each is admired by the
thousands of spectators for its own charm.
Down near the machinery hall the Union
Iron Works has reproduced its entire plant
in miniature.
An elaborate programme has been ar
ranged for to-night, which has been
termed "Scotch night." The following is
the order of exercises:
March, ' The Campbells"; overture, "White
Lady of Avenel" (Boieldien); descriptive nau

M. L. Crowe, Dr. J. A. McDonald, Thomas
Fraser.
Scottish Thistle Clubâ Chief Coulie, Alex
Campbell, William Dawson, G. W. Peterson.
All the Scotch in the City have been
notified of the event, and it is presumed
the clans will gathei as of yore. The fiery
croÂ«s has been sent out summoning the
McKays, McDougals, McKenzies and all
others to gather and descend on tbe Sas
senach. With waving plumes and broad
tartans Clans Fraser and Macdona.'d and
the Scottish Thistle Club will march into
the Pavilion. The pibroch of Douail Dhu
will summon the clans, and to the tune
of "The Campbells Are Coming" they
will appear 100 strong. The following '
notice was issued by the secretary of the
joint committee last night:
On Thnrsday evening, the 3d inst., the
Scotch people of this City will participate in
tbe festivities prepared for them at the home
produc:s exhibitior now holding forth at the
Mechanics' Pavilion on Larkin street. At 8
r. m. sharp the Scottish residents of San Frau
ci:vjo wi.l assemble at 32 O'Farrell street and
march down Stockton street to Market, to the
Mechanics' Pavilion, heeded by the Highland
pipers, clad in the "garb of auld Gael." The
affair will be under the direction of Chief
Kcrr of Clan Fraser and J. D- Coulie, royal
chief of the Scottish Thistle Club. On arriv
ing at the Pavilion a literary programme ol
rare excellence will be rendered.
The platform will be suitably decorated, in
cluding a lifelike portrait of Robert Burns. A
feature of the evening will be an address by
Hon. Irving M. Scott, who will be introduced
by Hugh Craig. A special invitation has been
issued to all Scotchmen and .Scotchwomen to
participate in the parade. All participants in
the parade will be admitted to the Paviliou
gratis on that occasion.

Secretary Joint Committee.
INTERCOLLEGIATE BALL
St. Mary's and St. Ignatius College
Teams to Contest.
What premises to be the most interest
ing event of the season in intercollegiate
baseball circles is the St. Mary-St. Ignatius
game, which is to take place at the Pre
sidio athletic grounds, Sunday, September
6, at 2:30 F. M.
These teams were rivals in the Califoraia
Intercollegiate League of the Midwinter
Fair, and in the several games played by
them at that time gave the prettiest exhi
bitions of amateur ball ever witnessed on a
local diamond. As they are very evenly
matched, both in the field and at the bat, v
rei-hot contest will surely result.
Sunday's game, whatever the result,
wi.U in all probability be but the first of a
series of three, all of which will be played in
this City.
Already over 1500 tickets have been sold
for the first game, and requests that cer
tain portions of the grand stand be re
served for students from Santa Clara, San
Jose and Oakland have been received. The
enthusiasm of a student gathering is
proverbial, so a vociferous time may be
expected by all who attend.
MURASKY ON SOCIALISM
He Instances Some of Its Ad
vantages to Society in
General.
Eloquent Address Before a Very Large
Audience in tbe Turk-Street
Temple.
Frank J. Murasky, the popular ex
grand president of the Young Men's Insti
tute, has added several thousand names
to the long roll of his friends through his
masterly address last night at the socialist
mass-meeting in the Turk-street Temple.
The meeting was held under the auspices
of Liberty Branch of the Socialist Labor
party, and the attendance at the temple
was large.
Secretary Theodore Lynch read from
the socialist paper. The People of Isew
York, an "Address to American Wage
workers," which was cordially received.
The warmest applause, however, greeted
Mr. Murasky as he stepped to the front in
response to a very flattering introduction
by Henry Warnecke, the president of the
evening.
Mr. Murasky reviewed the existing con
ditions of human society, dwelling upon
the injustices which some sections of the
body politic are now obliged to endure.
By way of a contrast he presented a
glowing word picture of the advantages
which belong to the ideal socialistic state.
He gave copious and telling quotations
from Emerson, Howells and other famous
English and American writers in support
of his contention that in socialism can be
found the remedy for existing political
evils.
Continuing, the lecturer referred to the
degrading conditions imposed by society
upon the world's toilers, instancing the
forlorn state of the diamond miners in
South Africa.
Many men, he said, regarded socialism
as an economic heresy, but others â among
whom was a millionaire friend of his,
whose name he preferred not to men
tion â were making a deep and earnest
study of socialistic teachings with a view
to estimating their probable effect as a
remedy for the present state of things.
''Christ in his sermon on tbe Mount,"
said Mr. Murasky in conclusion, "preacLed
socialism pure and simple. Were he pres
ent on the earth in human form to-day be
would preach it again. For my own part
I believe that socialism is true and its
principles irrefragable."
Amid much cheering and applause the
orator of the evening received a unani
mous vote of thanks, after wi ich brief
remarks were made by James Andrew, the
Socialist candidate for Lieutenant-Gov
ernor, Theodore Lynch, Leo Gassen, S.
beiler, M. Leiters, Ebel Hecht and Will
iam and the meeting adjourned
with the singing of the "Marseillaise"
hymn.
During the evening over a hundred
names were added to the petition asking
that the names of the Socialist candidate^
be printed on the official ballots Wit
nesses of the arrest ot Charles Sunflower
were requested to attend and testify if
need be in Judge Conlan's court to-day.
Isext Wednesday evening the Rev J E
Scott will deliver his famous lecture!
"Some Reasons Why I Am a Socialist,"
and it is also expected that Mr. Murasky
wiil again address the party in the near
future.
THE SA^ FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 3, 1896. .
CATHOLIC CADETS'
SECOND REGIMENT
League of the Cross to Be
Extended Through Cali
fornia.
OAKLAND ORGANIZING.
Grand Opening Rallies in Berke
ley and West Oakland Ar
ranged For.
FATHER O'RYAN TO OFFICIATE
Alameda County Will Have a Rfgi
ment, Then Branches Will Be Es
tablished E stwhere.
The League of the Cross is to have a
second regiment of cadets that will be a
close rival of the first, now well established
in San Francisco. Indeed, two companies
of the new regiment are already fairly
well established, and a third will be mus
tered in about the middle of this month.
The second regiment. League of the
Cross Cadets, will be confined to Alameda
County, and chiefly represented in Oak
lard, Alameda, Berkeley, Teraescal and the
Haywards and San Leandro district. With
four companies in Oakland and one each
at the other places, there would be a cadet
regiment of eight companies â a very re
spectable body of boys under 21 years of
age, all united under the banner of the
cross in the cause of temperance. Organi
zation in Alameda County has been begun
and will be pushed forward with great
vigor both by pastors of the various par
ishes and by the leaders of the league
movement in this City. It has the ap
proval and direction of Archbishop Rior
dan.
For this reason there can be no doubt of
its success. The Rev. Philip o'Ryan and
the Rev. Peter C. Yorke will take an ac
tive part in the work. They will deliver
addresses, tell about all the good there is
in the temperance movement, and inspire
the Catholic boys and younc men of Ala
meda County with enthusiasm for the
cause.
Sunday afternoon there will be the first
grand rally of the league in Berkeley.
There are about seventy-five boys in tbe
Berkeley branch, and it" is believed that
this rally will largely increase their num
bers. As soon as possible a cadet corps
win be established, but this will depend
on the support of friends of the league in
Berkeley, who will be called upon to aid
in securing uniforms and equipment.
Entertainments will be given and the pro
ceeds devoted to this purpose. At the
grand rally Father O'Ryan will deliver an
address and administer the pledge to ap
plicants who may desire to abstain from
intoxicating drinks until they shall have
reached the age of 21 years.
Immediately following the Berkeley
meeting the first opening rally will be
held in Oakland. Because of the nature
of this event all parishes across tbe bay
will be represented. The rally is to tafce
place in HanÂ»en's Hall on Eighth street
West Oakland. Father O'Ryan will ad
dress the meeting, and the Rev. J. B. Me-
Nally will also speak on temperance and
the aims of the League of the Cross. In
his parish there is a large and growing
cadet company, and the total membership
of the branch numbers 125.
The parish of St. Francis de Sales has
about 125 boys in its branch of the league,
many of whom are members of the cadet
company of St Francis de Sales. One
other newly organized branch so far con
stitutes the league in OaKiand, and tha.t is
the healthy one of the Immaculate Con
ception parish presided over by the ven
erable Father King. Tnis, too, will have
its cadet corps.
A week from next Sunday a branch and
the nucleus of a cadet company will be
organized at Temescal with appropriate
ceremony. Then will follow the organiza
tion of branches and companies in Ala
meda, in St. Anthony's parish, East Oak
land, and later in riay wards, which branch
will include the neighboring districts.
This organizing in Alameda County is
said to be only the beginning of a general
establishment of the league throughout
California. As soon as Oakland and the
adjacent districts are well in hand atten
tion will be turned to Santa Clara Valley
and the other populous places. Even now
a branch is being organized at Santa Cruz,
and there is some talk of organizing in
San Jose and Santa Clara. An officer of
the league stated yesterday that there was
every indication that instead of a regi
mental emcampment of the league next
year there will be a division camp, where
cadets from San Francisco and principal
cities around the bay will come together.
Edith Cole's Estate.
W. H. Crim and Emma Ransom have applied
for letters of guardianship over the estate and
person of Edith Baxter Cole, the adopted
daughter of Nathaniel Cole, whose estate wm
recently distributed. Miss Cole received
$41,000 as her share.
MR. M'JELLIPS' LECTURES.
His Wife Will Hear No More of Them
and Sues for a DivorcÂ«.
Henry L. McKellops, a Market-street
dentist, has been sued for divorce by his
wife, Eila.
If Sirs. McKellops is to be believed her
husband is a quarrelsome old thing. She
asks for a legal separation oc the ground
that he is in the habit of reading her cur
tain lectures from the time they retire, at
about 10 p. m.. until the hands of the clock
point to the small figures on the right of
the dial. He is also said to have remarked
that she is "the meanest woman in the
world."
The McKellops were married March 24,
1879, and have five children, the eldest 15
years of age and the youngest but two
months. Community property worth about
$1500 has been accumulated in their home
at 411 Leavenworth street.
The plaintiff prays that she be granted a
divorce; that she be awarded the com
munity property, the custody of the two
youngest children, attorney's fees and per
manent alimony. Anything else she de
sires will probably be mentioned in an
amended complaint.
POLICE TRIBUNAL.
The Cane of Sergeant Dfonaghan Dis
missedâCollins Fined.
The Police Commissioners met last
night and fined Policeman John B. Col
lins $5 for violating tbe rules of the de
partment.
The case of Sergeant Hugh Monagban,
who was represented by Attorney J. K.
Kic arris, was dismissed, at tha request of
Mrs. Monaghan and on motion of her at
torney, Patrick Keddy. A divorce suit
was pending, and Sergeant Monaghan, on
the advice of his attorney, standing firm,
it was decided that this was the best course"
to pursue.
MARRIED A MINISTER.
Miss Martha Kuner and the
Rev. Herman Gehrcke
United.
A Pretty German Wedding in the
Pastor's Own
Church.
A very pretty German ceremony took
place at 7 o'clock yesterday evening at St.
Matthew's German Lutheran Church on
Eleventh street, when Mrs. Martha Kuner
and Rev. Herman Gehrcke were united
in marriage.
The bridesmaids, Misses, Anita and
Myrtle Hermes, with the maid of honor,
Miss Schwerin, led the bridal procession,
followed by the bride leaning on the arm
of her father, Albert Kuner. The groom,
accompanied by his best man, R. A.
Kuner, brother to the bride, met the bride
in front of the altar, where the Rev. A.
Jather, pastor of St. Mark's Church of
O.ikl and, received them and bound them
in holy wedlock.
The Rev. Gehrcke is pastor of the church
where he wus married. He is a native of
Hildesheim, Germany, and has been a
resident of this city the last five years.
At the conclusion of the ceremony the
bridal party adjourned to the home of the
bride, where a sumptuous banquet was
served.
The young couple will start tnis morn
ing for the southern part of the State,
where a brief honeymoon will be enjoyed.
SPOKE OF GENERAL GRANT
Comrades of George H. Thomas
Post, G. A. R., Listened to
W. H. L. Barnes.
A Fraternal Visit From Admiral
D. D. Porter Post, Oak
land-
The rooms of George H. Thomas Post,
G. A. R., at 320 Post street, were crowded by
comrades Monday evening, who assembled
to hear General W. H. L. Barnes speak.
The occasion was enlivened by a visit
from Admiral D. D. Porter Post No. 169,
Oakland. Several comrades from Lincoln
Pest, among them H. C. Dibble and C.
Mason Kinne, were present.
General Barnes spoke of Grant, and
spoke in an interesting and instructive
style. It is the fancy of the eloquent
orator to address the Post occasionaly,
taking for the topic of his talk, Lincoln,
Grant or some other conspicuous figure in
National history. Last evening he spoke
of Grant on the Pacific, and the discourse
was rendered interesting in a remarkable
degree by the recital of some incidents and
events In the life of the great leader that
have never been published. He traced the
fortunes of the illustrious soldier from the
time that he was poor and almost friend
less in Oregon, until he had achieved the
greatest honors that this country can
bestow upon a citizen or a soldier.
The orator paid an eloquent tribute to
the modest worth and simplicity of Grant
reference was made to the fact that
General Grant, when in the zenith of his
fame, remembered a gentleman, now a
resident of California, who had long years
before rendered him a service when he was
in great distress and almost on the verge
of despair.
Grant's masterly qualities of leader
ship in action and his attribute of gener
osity to the vanquished when the conflict
was done were eulogized. It was obvious
to all who had the pleasure of listening to
the talk that General Barnes had made a
special and careful atudy of Grant as a
citizen, as a soldier and as President of
the United States. He expressed tho idea
that men would be better in citizenship if
they would study the character and career
of such American citizens as Lincoln and
Grant. The time, he said, was auspicious
for such study.
The nddress elicited the hearteÂ«t ap
plause and the orator received a unani
mous vote of thanks from the assembled
comrades.

TOOK POISON AND
TURNED ON GAS,
Belle Stevenson Makes
Careful Preparations
for Suicide.
HER SUCCESS IN DOUBT
Pasted Strips of Wrapping Paper
Over the Cracks in Her
Door.
THEN OPENED ALL THE JETS.
After dressing in Funeral Garb and
Swallowing Carbolic Acid She
Lay Down to Die.
A woman named Belle Stevenson made a
most determined attempt to commit
suicide in the Florence Hotel, corner of
The Room in "Which Belle Stevenson Made Her Deliberate Attempt
at Self-Murder.
Powell and Ellis streets, yesterday morn
ing.
She went to the hotel between 5 and 6
o'clock Tuesday afternoon and asked for a
room. The landlord, Thomas Withers,
asked her to register her name, but she
declined, as she had her gloves on. With
ers told her all guests had to register, and
again asked her name.
"Put down Marfca," she said after some
hesitation.
"Mrs. or Miss?" asked Withers.
"Mrs. H. Marks," she replied.
She looked at room 23 on the first floor,
but did not liKe it, preferring room 30 on
the top floor, which she paid for.
The woman carried in her hand a small
valise. Herclothing was neat but of cheap
material, and she wore an ecru cape, a
black woolen aress, straw colored waist
and a rough straw hat. Withers thought
she looked like a woman from the country.
About 7 o'clock she came downstairs
and asked Mrs. Hooper, the housekeeper,
for some matches and she pot a supply.
Half an hour later she went down in the
elevator to the street. It is not known
when she returned, as she must have
walked upstairs instead of taking the ele
vator.
Ab6ut 5 o'clock yesterday morning the
night watchman rang the housekeeper's
bell and told her that something must be
wrong in room 30, as he heard a woman
moaning as if in pain. He got the house
keeper's passkey and opened the door. A
peculiar cracking noise scared him for a
moment and a volume of gas that poured
out of the open door almost suffocated
him. He rushed for the window and
threw it wide open. Then he groped for
the gas-burners and found both turned on
full cock. He quickly turned them off
and staggered out of the room and noti
fied the proprietor.
They went to the woman's room and
found her stretched on the bed. She was
frothing at the mouth and her lips were
blue. She was moaning and was seized
with occasional spasms.
An examination of the room showed
that she had made careful preparations
for death. The cracks in the door had
been covered with strips of wrapping
paper which she had pasted on with mu
cilage. She had stuffed her skirt into tbe
space at the bottom of the door, and had
covered the keyhole with her cloak. All
this was done to prevent the gas from es
caping.
After making these preparations she
put on clean underclothing and a neat
night robe. Then she apparently drank
some carbolic acid from a bottle which
was found in one of the bureau drawers,
and turned on the gas from both burners.
The carbolic acid must have caused her
intense pain before she lost consciousness,
as a towel in the room was covered with
blood which she had expectorated.
Withers summoned the patrol wagon
and the woman was taken to the Receiving
Hospital, where Dr. Fitzgibbons used all
the usual remedies to restore her to con
sciousness, but without avail. In view of
the fact that she also took carbolic acid
her chances of recovery are doubtful.
In her purse was found $1 50, but no pa
pers to give a clew to her identity were
found either in her purse, valise or pock
ets. The mucilage bottle was in the room,
but a pair of scissors could not be found,
and the supposition is that she had clipped
the wrapping-paper into strips before go
ing to the hotel ana had placed the strips
in her valise.
Four or five cigarettes, partly consumed,
were found on the floor, and some tobacco
in her valise.
The woman came from Arizona about
three years ago and had been working as
a dressmaker and milliner.
For the past year she had been rooming
in the house of Professor Albert Le Forst,
30 Lewis street. She left there Tuesday
afternoon about 4 o'clock, and as she did
not return inquiries were made at the
hospital and her identification followed.
The professor said she had been in poor
health for a long time and that possibly
would account for her seeding to end her
life. He thought she was a married
woman or a widow, as shÂ« always wore a
plain gold ring on her left hand. He
knew nothing whatever about her past
history.
She had evidently disposed of her mar
riage ring and a gold scarfpin she always
wore, as neither was found in her posses
sion.
She had not regained consciousness up
to a late hour last night and her condition
had not improved.

SIMON KOSHLAND BURIED.
The Pioneer Wool Merchant I<aid in
the Home of Peace.
Simon Koshland, tha wool merchant,
was buried yesterday morning from the
family home. 1808 Pine street. He died
Monday from an apopletic stroke.
Rabbi Voorsanger conducted the ser
vices. He spoke with deep feeling of the
deceased, to whom he paid a nigh tribute.
Mr. Koshland was a member of the
congregation Emanu-El. He was a strictly
orthodox Jew, and when a number of
years ago the congreeation of the Temple
Eman u-Et decided upon reform methods
he, with a coterie of friends, withdrew
therefrom and founded the Mason-street
Syna-ogue, of which Rev. Dr. Bettleheim
was rabbi for a number of years. Latterly
he rejoined the Temple, and remained a
prominent member to the day he died.
The remains were interred in the Home
of Peace Cemetery, and conducted to their
last resting-place by a large concourse of
relatives and friends

NEW TO-OAT.
Where Men
Are Weak
In the small of the back, the general nerve,
muscular and sexual center â thn point at
which the nerves, which feed nearly all the
vital functions of the body, beginâ this is
where nearly all men and women are weak. A
pain here .may mean, and generally does, the
exhaustion of nerve strength in the vital or-
gans. It is the nerves crying for aid, and no
pain at this point should be passed as imma-
terial. It will come again, and with greater
severity, and if the message given by the nerves
is not attended to it may result in general
nervous prostration, impotency or Bright'!
disease of the kidneys.
DR. SAWS ELECTRIC BELT.
Whatever the cause of these pains in thÂ«
back they are nerve pains. They mean that
the nerves are suffering, and a remedy which
will cure the nerves will remove the cause of
the pain. As electricity is the life of the nerves
it is the only remedy that will cure them. This
explains the wonderful and exclusive success
of Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt. Its full strength,
and it gives a volume of electricity into tho
body, which saturates the system in throe
hours, is directed to the small of tho back,
where it enters the nerve centers and feeds
them.

ONE-MAN POWER,
George T. Gaden Advances
Reasons in Favor of
the Charter.
THE CONCENTRATION OF
POWER.
Emphasizes the Importance of
Municipal Reform to Lo
cal Progress.
THE PRESENT SYSTEM IS TOO
COMPLIX.
What Is Particularly Needed, Says
Mr. Gaden, Is Honesty of Purpose
and Activity in Execution.
The following communication from
George T. Gaden is self-exDlanatorv :
We have lived 100 years and have not yet
learned to govern large cities. In the begin-
B had none. A few small cities of the
1-cnod of the Revolution have grown enor
mously and the number has increased. They
will continue to do so.
To the City of San Francisco, especially, the
question of municipal government is a press
ing one. Nearly one-fourth of the population
of our whole State lives in San Francisco, and
by reason of her geographical position and
mercantile importance in another generation
she should have tiio majority of votes and give
laws to the whole State. Our Federal Govern
ment is founded upon the divine right of the
Jteopia to govern their own affairs, but well
ounded only when ability to do so exists, and
without it can be no claim of right. The voice
of the people may be called the voice of God
only when it is the utterance of intelligent,
patriotic, disciplined minds, not the selfish
greed of political bosses, of the despotism of
corporations or of the ill-ttiinking bizot or
fanatic.
Unsettled problems of government are not
to be settled or solved merely by the spread of
what we call popular education. The trained
and sharpened intellect is often used for self
ish ends, regardless of the general good.
Knowledge is not wisdom, but it is the path by
which we obtain wisdom. Knowledge is not
virtue,, but it is the means whereby we may
more readily and accurately distinguish be
tween right and wrong.
Suffrage itself is no panacea for political
evils. If ignorant, it is entirely controlled by
Combinations of money and-power. Neverthe
less, geueral suffrage is the best guarantee to
both governors and governed â the best pro
tection at once to liberty and order. A com
iT-unity may get on with a suffrage exercised
in part by ignorant and vicious men, so long
as the proportion of these be not so large as
to hold, as it were, the balance of power, and
enable them to effect temporary corrup: alli
ances with the bosses and leaders of contend
ing parties, now on one aide, now on the
other. In this republic the people is king,
and as is the character of the king, such will
be the character of the government. When
the dospotism of money power and curse of
corporate rule is so largely infused into our
civic institutions as now, a government by the
people is impossible.
When under any leadership these elements
become well enough organized to control the
politics of the City and State the Government
will be bad in tendency and despotic in rule.
Thus even in this, the most popular Govern
ment known to history, does power steal away
from the many to the few and often turn to
one political chiettain. Here, where we have
ho holy a horror of the "one-man power," the
interests of the community are often guided
by one man, and frequently one not iv official
life. This is the "one-man power" reasserting
itself, an essential element of every Govern
ment, whether of a party organization, of a
railroad company or any brunch of private
business. We have unwisely bhut it out from
our State constitution and our City charters.
Biill it makes itself felt, because in the very
nature of things it is a necessity.
We refuse the necessary undivided executive
power to the oilicial openly chosen by the
voice of the people and it is seized by some
me else, self-aDpointed or elected in secret by a
few. In framing of late years our forms of
government, both State and municipal, we
have been led astray from the best model of
government before us, viz. ; the constitution
of the United States, under whicn the admin
istrator is the man whg has been chosen Pres
ident by the people. He has around him ad
visers oi his own choosing, but no equals. The
executive branch, of an effective Government
xnusi always consist of a single head, and to
that head must be accountable the officers In
trusted with every actual administration of
the Government.
A despotism is the rule of one man for an
unlimited period, and subject to no law save
that of nis own willâ a power to be dreaded.
In a free government there must still be one
man who is chief ruler, but there can be no
dangerous "one-man power" in a republic,
with its frequent elections. The chief magis
trate is merely the temporary agent of the
people to enforce their laws, not his own â laws
prescribed by them through another agency.
Ho, himself subject to these laws, iÂ« in power
for a short time; is in fear of public con
demnation at the end of it; may be removed
even before it ends by impeachment; may be
otherwise punished like other men for abuse
of his trust.
li we wili not have this regulated "one-man
power" in the Government we shall have it
cropping up irregularly, as I have described,
and as we all know from experience. What
we should most dread is the irresponsible
'â¢one-man power" which may come in as the
consequence of bad government, resulting
from the weakening of authority and confu
sion of responsibility. No good substitute can
be found for a single executive power. Substi
tutes have been tried in New York in the early
eighties. The distribution of administrative
power among independent heads of depart
ments proved a failure, and the distribution
of power and responsibility in this State
among boards and commissions and other de
partments has been a most costly experiment
To promote good administration under any
lorm of government one man (subject to the
laws) must be, for the time being, chief,
whether he be called prime minister, presi
dent, governor or mayor. A single executive
has this advantage, that, Independent of the
restraints of law, there are certain moral re
straints which act upon an individual, but are
ineffective wbeu we seek to apply them to
bodies of men, or to a number of men among
whom responsibility is divided. Conscience is
not a thing that can be 6afely distributed â a
little bit for the separate use of each individ
ual member of a numerous body. A man is
capable of shame. A boay of men, as is well
known, feels in a much less degree this natu
ral restraint upon human conduct.
Under the State and municipal laws now ex
isting it is impossible to have good govern
ment. Those which we are supposed to work
under at present did nothing when framed
but break apart and disconnect the machinery
whereby the State and municipal government
was carried on. They provide for a Mayor
whose duty is said to oe to execute the laws
and administer the ailairs ot a municipality,
and then give to the people (which really
means the political bosses), not the ilayor, the
power to seiect all Hubordinate officers on
w hom we must rely in their several depart
ments lor the performance of the actual de
tails of administration.
Any one can see the absurdity of snch a sys
tem, and no one sees it bo plainly as the bosses
and the corrupt powers that stand behind
them, who under such laws are protected in
tneir nefarious business of "doing politics."
Apply their methods to our Federal Govern
ment aad see how they would work in Wash
ington. What is true of the Federal is also
true of the State and municipal affairs. Sup
pose all secretaries and the Attorney-General
were elected by the people, independent of
the President, at different times and by differ
ent parties. We would then have eight or ten
Presidents instead of oneâ a hard-money Presi
dent, perhapsâ a eoft-money Secretary of the
Treasury, a namby-pamby, peacefully ais
j>osed Secretary of State, who would like to
keep us out of war with foreign powers, and a
warlike Secretary of the Navy, who would
like to plunge us 'into one, a Secretary of War
who would be undecided and hesitate be
tween the two policies, while the Attorney-
General would be overwhelmed with calls
from all sorts of people for all sorts of
opinions, while the chiei magistrate himself
would sit in dumb show in the White House
wondering what else he was there tor. From
any such Federal administration we would
expect nothing but confusion and ruin. It is
jusiM Â»bsuia to expect good government ia t
this City and State until we conform to the ex
perience of the ages and establish a single and
united executive power. On this executive
power the Legislature and the judiciary ;ire
the proper and sufficient restraints.
Of course if the people are incapable of
choosing wise men to make their laws and
honest and fearless Judges to interpret them,
and if for this reason we cannot be sure about
the restraint upon the executive power, that is
a defect that lies deep and is an unanswerable
argument for the necessity fur the formation
by public-spirited citizens of associations, fed
erations or guilds (if you please) to wipe from
the face of the earth the so-cailcd best citi
zen, characterized a short time ago by the
Mayor of Chicago as "the anarchist of Amer
ica, and thus give the people a fair chance.
Do not ask them to do impossibilities und do
not expect them to run a government with
crazy machinery.
We must not lose faith in popular govern
ment until the people are brought to a sense of
their own degradation and slavery by reason
of boss domination and corporate infamy.
Make them see where they stand and popular
government will not be a failure in Uiis
country. One thing to be remembered is,
however, that notwithstanding all the evils
that exist in this City, the lovers of good order
and honest government are, as in other cities,
in the majority. Public order is as easily
maintained here as anywhere in the world.
Respect for law and desire for peace is mani
fest whenever the peoule gather in large
assemblages, and especially is this true of the
so-called common people. Who the common
people are, however, ii would not perhaps be
well to define. The people not only love order,
but are desirous of good government.
All large bodies of men to act efficiently need
leaders, and there are those whose duty it is
to lead. Men of property, whether they have
leisure or net, men of exceptional culture owe
to this Government a higher duty than mere
voting, and yet this simple duty they more
than any other neglect
The people have shown on more than one
occasion during the last few yean that they
are ready to break away in large numbers
from bosses and party leaders when it can be
proven to them that it is expedient to do so.
When the Legislature gives San Francisco
municipal government in conformity with the
general idea of American institutions it will
have performed its whole duty. All further
resDonsibility is on the people of San Fran
cisco themselves. If they culpably neglect
their own affairs; it they will not give to po
litical matters the same attention which the
rest of the people in their several localities are
in the habit of giving, they must suffer the
consequences. No self-acting machinery can
be devised which will do what the people are
bound to do. The complicated machinery that
now exists serves only to invite the combina
tion of designing men whose thieving opera
tions are concealed underneath it.
Give to the City of San Francisco a chief
executive with full power to appoint heads of
administrative departments. Let him have
the power to appoint as well as to remove his
subordinates, being required publicly to as
sign his reasons. This must be done sooner or
later. Make him the head of the police, as the
Governor is the head oi the National Guard,
with proper protection to the heads of the
force against removal while faithful to duty;
make him responsible for all waste and im
proper expenditures by requiring from him
through the department of finance an estimate
of what money is needed for the support of the
government and its various departments bo
fore any appropriation is made.
Give to the people full representation in the
Common Council, which shall be confined to
legislative duties and excluded from all ad
ministrative ones. Give to the Common Coun
cil the power to reduce estimates of expendi
tures, but not to increase them; the power to
limit exDenditures, but not to originate appro
priations. Give to the Mayor and Common
Council the power to regulate taxes, to expend
each year what money they see tit in cash ex
penditures, but limit rigidly by law the power
to increase debts. If the expenditures are
wasteful, let the people feel it in their taxes
and apply the antidote. Add such provisions
as shall procure frequent publication of expen
ditures aud transactions oi the City govern
ment and secure a ready access for taxpayers
to City accounts and opportunities to the
people to change their chief magistrate at
short intervals. Thus are all the saieguards of
good government lurnished.
In a scheme of city government there is,
more than in any other, the need of a strong
and thoroughly responsible executive for the
same reason that wucn a body of men is con
fined within the narrow limits of a ship in
mid-ocean the government thereof must of
necessity be administered by one man prompt
to make his will fell, and to whom prompt
obedience must be rendered â by one who
knows that he alone will be held responsible
for disaster.
We can less afford here than in a community
more dispersed to dispense with concentrated
responsibility.
To require the consent of the Common Coun
cil (or of a Board of Supervisors) to the Mayor's
appointment of the heads of departments only
opens tne way tor dictation by the Council, or
for bargains, or what is commonly called "a
pull." This is not the way to get good men.
The head of every department should be a
single one â no boards or commissions â and
thus will the resconsibility to the Mayor be
concentrated, as his is to the people.
What we need is not a complex system, but
one that is simple and direct, and ull through
vrhich shou.d run one sound principle. Such
is the scheme of the immense business houses
of the world â one man at the head of every
branch and every one responsible to the head
of all. It is strange that the banker, the mer
chant and the broker, in fact, any individual
in the business world, canuot see that the
principle which they apply to their counting
houses and offices is not applied to public
administration, and that it must be applied
or we cannot hope for anything but a corrupt
and wasteful expenditure of the people's
money. These very menâ kin^s in the busi
ness worldâ will also, year after year, submit
to legislative enactments which in every es
sential particularly violate all sound business
methods and which if applied to their own
affairs would produce nothing but bankruptcy
aud ruin.
No doubt what has been here paid, as well as
the adoption of the new charter, will bs ob
jected to by many, for the most part by poli
ticians and their bosses, on the ground that
the experience of large cities in their Mayors
does not warrant vesting in that executive so
much power. But does the experience of
these same cities under Mayors without power
prove that system to be a better one? The
latter has been tried, and it has always failed.
The first, up to this time, has only been par
tially tried.
Another objection to the charter will be that
the system it proposes gives too much patron
age to the Mayer. So much the worse for him.
The distribution oi patronage makes enemies
as well as .friends. No man in America ever
undertook to build up a personal party or
perpetuate power by means of it successfully.
Shall we rather have patronage in the hands
of boards, in whose secret councils it is par
celed out ? Is it not better to submit to the
minor evil of an executive with too much
patronage than to accept the greater one of an
executive with too little power?
Again, some will say, "What ieason have I to
expect the people will choose the proper man
for Mayor?" If they wi,l not that id a delect
for which a remedy can be found when the evil
presents iueif. We believe they will. , The
more importance given to the oflicn the more
importance the people- will attach to their
selection of a man to fill it, and the more
likely is it that the most capable and trust
worthy man among us will be willing to accept
it. Concentrate the attention of tne people
upon the election of the Mayor as the one and
only thing they have to do with the executive
branch of the City's government.
A rich man in New York once expressed his
disgust at our system of government, because
his coachmau'B vole could offset his. He was
told that his coachman probably paid more
attention to public affairs than he did. The
same rich man was met at the polls some
time after with his hands full of tickets, the
tickets full of names and his face full of per
plexity and despair. He asked a friend, "What
are all these names we have to vote for to
day?" To which the friend replied. "I know
of no person who can give any better informa
tion on that point than your coachman, whom
I saw here a few moments ago." If this worthy
citizen had had to vote simply for the Mayor
and a common Councilman he would not have
been in that perplexing condition.
But again, it is said, If we give a Mayor so
much power how are we to restrain him from
abusing it? The answer to this objection has
been made further back in these pages, but let
it once more be emphasized: First, there will
be the restraint of the Mayor's consciousness
thai he is responsible for all maladministra
tion; second, on him will concentrate the
criticism of thÂ« powerful press, and his will be
the shame before public opinion.
Referring again to the police, let us urge
that the Mayor be made Cuonmander-in-chief
of the police, just as the Governor is of the
National Guard of the State. Let the Mayor
appoint a secretary of police who will bear to
iiim and to the force the same relation as the
adjutant-general does to the Governor and the
National Guard. Let him be put in actual
command of the force and hold office long
enough to enable nim to perfect organization
and discipline, and muke provision lor prompt
suspension for misconduct and for removal
after trial before a proper tribunal.
Experience does not show that the posses
sion of property is a guarantee of public or
private virtue, or of fidelity even to the or
dinary duties of citizenship, but we are begin
ning to know very certainly that some of the
most faithful and efficient men in public and
private life live poor and die poor. The wel
lareof a great city is almost lost sight of in
the tremendous struggle for power and greed
for personal gain. Partisanship has been our
greatest curseâ the greatest meuace to our free
institutions. Ignorance is bad enough, but it
does not give snch a deadly, blighting touch
as that of fanatical party slavery.
People who are honorable in all the other
walks of life have stooped to the most villain
ous methods for party supremacy. A person
Ik a good citizen only in proportion to the in
terest he takes in public affairs and at he is
freed from party feeling. Party is all right so
long v tiie citizen uses it for a noble purpose,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 3, 1896.
but when used for private ends it becomes a
merciless tyrant.
The question of the adoption of our new
charter at the next election is not one of party
politics. It is a matter that touches to the
quick every citizen of Ban Francisco, and I re
joice that the mishty press of the city is lifting
the whole subject from the low plain of parti
sanship to that of patriotism, and making an
indignant outcry against the corruption aad
vice which are sapping the foundations of our
liberties.
Society iÂ« well governed only when the peo
ple obey those in authority, and the authori
ties obey the law.
We plead for the effective execution of the
power and will of the people by their one
chosen executive, subject to the restraints of
the Legislature, the judiciary and the law,with
out which system confusion ensues, corrup
tion creeps in and responsibility becomes un
settled. There can be no danger of tyranny
in clothing the agent of the poopie to execute
the will of the people.
The Mayor ot this City, as we all know, is
absolutely without power. Every head of de
partment holds Hice independent of him,
borne for a longer wrva than his own. By the
adoption of the new charter he becomes a live
power iv the government, not full grown, but
growing. The benefits of such a system are
acknowledged by all good citizens everywhere.
The politicians and the bosses only will array
themselves agains: it. for under the new
regime they behold visions of their illgottcn
gains fast melting away.
To effect our redemption from under which
we are now groaning we must all put our
shoulders to the wheel. Our iorin of govern
ment demands political duty of every man. If
any among us habitually neglect it the very
stones should cry out to him when misgovern
ment comes: "Thou art the man â the re
sponsible man."
Those who have special advantages must
take tho heaviest burdens, and all persevere as
we do in other things in spite of occasional
disappointments.
We need not all attend primary meetings.
Voluntary associations of men who desire not
office for themselvts, but good government for
all, can, as experience proves, exercise a
powerful influence.
Political duties cannot be attended to by
Eroxyâ by hiring others to do It for us. Our
rains ought to be worth more than our
money and far less demoralizing in political
work. The people arc quick to recognize the
unselfish purpose of the honest man, aud
those who seek office will be anxious for such
a man's favor.. Let us not trust to devices to
Rev. W. TV. Bolton and J. W. Laing. MA, as They Appeared on Returning to
Civilization.
make the minority control and govern the
majority. That it not Americanism. It is
cunning, not wisdom.
Our forefathers did not invent a government
out of their own imaginations. They knew
that for centuries their ancestors in the Old
World had been struggling alter responsible
intent on the principle that power and
the accountability ot the people should go to
gether, and u;Â«>n tliat knowledge they built.
]>t us follow their precepts and example and
we may hope to witness the steady, healthy
growth of our country, our State and City.
The glory and strength of a State consists
not in its public edifices, its public works, its
monuments of public aud private splendor
and magnificence, but in the' wider diffusion
of the dements of peace, prosperity and do
mestic happiness among its people. The
source of strengih in any land is to be found
only In the purity and vigor of character, the
self-control oi the men and women who con
stitute it. Its true glory is in the general dif
fusion of virtue, peace and comfort among the
homes of the people.
HE WILL SOUND THE BAY.
Then General Duffield Will In
spect the Site of the
Observatory.
Interesting Details Co'lected in Far
Alaska Regarding the
Boundary.
General William W. Duffield of Wash
ington, D. C, superintendent of the United
States Coast and Godetic Survey, arrived
here yesterday and is at t be Occidental.
For a month and a half past hi has
been in far Alaska on a tour of inspection
of all the points that have been surveyed in
connection with the boundary of British
Columbia and Alaska. He was accom
panied on his trip by Lieutenant Hugh
Rodman of the United States navy.
In an interview it was stated that they
haa gone as far north as Mount St. Elias,
or latitude 60 deg. They went up in the
coast survey steamer Patterson. They
looked over the region very carefully and
collected a lot cf facts on which to base
future work.
Ihe trip was a long one, but very inter
esting to General Duffiela. He considers
himself well repaid for his efforts. He now
begins some very important work here.
It is in connection with the harbor and the
Presidio.
"The idea ia to complete an entire new
survey of the San Francisco Bay," was ex
plained. "Part of this work is done al
ready. We will make the survey from the
Golden Gate to Berkeley, and from there
down to Mission Rock, taking in tho
whole of the bay.
"We are simply inspecting the work
done for a hydrographic survey, which
simply means getting the soundings. The
work here is very important. We will go
out on the bay to-morrow in the United
States steamer McArthur to begin the in
specting.
"While we are here we will inspect the
site of the new observatory at the Pre
sidio, and we will also inspect the work ot
Captain Rogers, who is in charge of the
subordinate offices of the Pacfic Coast.
"I think we will return to Washington
by the end of the week."
General Duffield is well along in years,
but is well preserved. He has enjoyed his
long trip to the :orth, there being much
of interest to him over the whole route.
The Hcydenfeldt Estate.
Thomas O. Heydenfeldt and Zelia O. Hel
lings, heirs of Solomon O. Heydenfeldt, have
petitioned the Probate Court for the issuance
of a citation commanding Charles Ashton
and Julius Jacobs, executors of Solomon Hey
denfeldt's will, to appear in court and show
cause why they should not be punished for
contempt in failing to pay an indebtedness of
$31,000 due the German Savings and Loan
Society from the estate. The loan was eecured
by a mortgage on property at Sacramento and
Leidesdorff streets, which property was sold
to satisfy the mortgage. Tne buyers are, how
ever, willing to return it to the estate on pay
ment of the $31,000. This was ordered by the
court, but the executors failed to comply with
the order, hence the citation.

EXPLORED VANCOUVER.
The First Who Ever Passed
Through the Center of the
Island.
FOUND NO PRECIOUS METALS.
The Scenery Was Superb, but the
Snow Mountains Offer No Invita
tion to Settlers.
Jlev. W. W. Bolton, rector of St. Mary
the Virgin's, and J. W. Laing, M.A., his
friend, arrived back yesterday from their
exploring trip into the unknown portions
of the island of Vancouver. They were
both sunburnt almost out of recognition,
but were in splendid health and full of
enthusiasm for the dangerous and excit
ing experiences through which they hive
just, passed.
"It was a trying trip," said Mr. Bolton, |
"but we we?e fortunate in having no acci- \
dents, and as we made the distances '<
we wished to cover we are thoroughly sat- \
isfied with the results of our journey."
Mr. Laing, who organized the expedi
tion and covered the financial end of it,
wa>Â» full of information about the beauty i
of the island, but he said they have dem- j
onstrated that the central portions of in- '
terior Vancouver are no place for settlers, i
"It is a magnificent country for the j
lovers of nature, but jagged, snow-capped
mountains and steep declines offer little
temptation to people to settle. In Victo
ria we looked up the records left by previ
ous explorers, who, however, do not pre
tend to have penetrated so far into the
interior as we aid, and we found that they
often misrepresented things. In t-ome
cases I imagine they must have examined
the patches of arable land they speak of
from the top of some neighboring moun
tain with the aid of a telescope. At the
head of Woss Lake, for instance, one ex- I
piorer says there is a tine tract of arable j
land. We examined it, and found it to be
a swamp. Tne Government makes a mis
take in accepting the word of some of the
explorers whose records we found in Vic
toria. Most of the rivers and lakes in
Northern Vancouver are very inaccurately
marked on the maps. VVe are now prepar
ing maps for tne admiralty, which will
be official.
Mr. Laing says that Vancouver is one of
the best watered countries he ever saw in
his life, but that nownere in the course of
his explorings in the northern portion of
the island did he or Mr. Bolton find traces
of the precious metals. The only discov
ery was quantities of beautiful marble,
but that was in such inaccessible places
that there is very little probability that it
will ever be utilized.
The party, in addition to the gentlemen
mentioned, consisted of two guides from
Seattle, both accustomed to mountaineer
ing and pack-carrying, ana E. Fleming of
Victoria, a photographer. Packs with
provisions to last two weeks were carried,
as well as axes, puns, instruments for
measuring altitudes and cameias. The
distance covered in the wilderness was 315
miles, 200 of that being by canoe and raft.
The other 100 miles were walked, through
dense brush and forest, over snow-covered
mountains and down slides of rock and
gravel.
The start proper was made from Alert
Bay on the east coast, about 240 miles from
Victoria, a settlement thickly peopled
with Indians of the Nimpkiscb tribe, and
with two of the chiefs the party contracted
to be taken in canoes to Woss Lake, be
yond which no explorer had ever pene
trated. The only way open is up the
Nimpkisch Kiver.which has in all 140 rap
ids. At each of them the party had to
leave the boats and pull the canoes against
stream. At the junction of the JNinipkisch
with the Kla-Anch River fhe Indians de
clared that they could go no further, as
the water wa- ;â â â > shallow to carry the
canoes. Tiu-y insisted on being pafd for
the Thole distance, however, ajjd when
they departed stole thirty pounds of bacon,
which caused the party to live on beans
and biscuits for the next nine days.
The next move was to walk seven miles
through almost impenetrable timber land,
with the aid of a compass and an ax, to
Woss Lake. There a raft was built and
rude oars were constructed out of limbs of
trees. After waiting all day for a fierce
gale to subside the explorers set out by
night down the weird, solitary lake,
where no sound could be heard but the
rush ol waterfalls, some of them descend
ing a distance of 4000 feet.
At the end of the lake a steep, rocky as
cent led to a pass in the mountain. This
was traversed for some distance, and then
the party found an inaccessible wall of
rock over 4000 feet high facing them
There being no valley to pass through it
was necessary to right-about face and to
return to the divide, from whence the ex
plorers struck off eastv.-ard to the coast in
order to replenish their store of pro
visions, for, though deer and elk were
3een, they never came within range of tne
rifle.
At Friendly Cove food was obtained
lrom settlers, and the party having now
crossed the island from east to west re
solved to strike off for the south through
tho Connunia Peak country, where Con
numa Mountain stands, a magnificent
landmark. Mr. Laing says that from a
near view this peak loots like a mere
needle aud that he believes it to be inac
cessible. "In the country surrounding it
you might say that the snow peaks were
legion, lor there are many. We were con
tinually going up ami down ciountair.s
and rock slides ahd decided that the small
amount of arable land in the valleys was
too inaccessible to be of any practical use
to settlers."
One of the greatest feats achieved by the
party was the climbing of Central Crags
and the plantinsof the British and Ameri
can flaes there, side by side. It has gen
erally been believed that Mount Victoria
is the highest peak in the island, but the
Laing exploring party haa proved from
observations taken on the spot that
Central Crags, situated in the heart of the
island, reaches a higher elevation, that of
7500 feet. In making the ascent of Central
Crags tiie party was at one time detained
by fog in the snow for two nights and a
day, unable to see a foot before them.
Continuing the journey southward Al
fterni was finally reached by way of
Buttles Lake, and thus ended the first ex
ploring expedition that has ever been
taken right through the heart of Central
Vancouver, though two years ago Mr.
Bolton explored tho interior of Central
Vancouver.
FOREIGN MISSIONARIES.
Encouraging Reports Keceived From
Those Who Have Labored. Abroad.
The "Women's Foreign Missionary Asso
ciation, under the jurisdiction of the Con
gregational chinch of the Pacific Coast,
held its annual meeting at Bethany church
on Bartlett street yesterday.
There were present: Mrs. H. E. Jewitt
ofVacaville, president; Mrs. W. J. Wilcox
of Oakland and Mrs. J. A. Cruzan of this
City, home secretaries; Miss Bessie Mer
iaru, treasurer; witn fifty-six delegates
representing as many auxiliaries of the
Pacific Coast, with about 400 ladies, all of
whom have taken a deep interest in the
work of the missionaries.
Among those who have been in foreign
lands for a number of years, laboring with
the natives, were the Rev. J. C. Perkins
and his sister, Miss Mary Perkins, who
have been in India for the past ten years;
Mrs. Watkins, who has been in Mexico for
twenty-three years; Mrs. Gouldy, from
Japan, and Mrs. Arthur Smith, from
China.
All of these gave their experience in
their labors among the natives and the
difficulties encountered to educate them
Into a knowledge of Christianity.
Kind and encouraging words were re
ceived from the home branch in Boston
and other Eastern cities. In addition to
this the fifty-six delegates representing a
Bimilar number of branches on thi3 coast
reported progress in each of their aux
iliaries, and a!l had words of praise for
the returning missionaries who had been
so long absent.
At the close of the service each mis
sionary appeared in ti.e costume of the na
tives among whom he had been sojourn
ing and spoke in the language of the coun
try. Miss Perkins had added much in
the shape of novelty by having a circle of
little girls appear robed after the fashion
of the Indian children.
From the flattering reports received the
Congregational church has every reason to
feel gratified at the success of its missions.
Railroad Commissioners Sleet.
At the meeting of the Railroad Commission
ers yesterday, at which Commissioners La Rue
and Stanton were present, the only business
transacted was the auditing of bills for the
past month and the passage of a resolution re
questing the Board r>i Examiners to create a
deficiency fund of $1000 out of which to pay
the expenses incident to the suit recently tritv'l
in the United States Circuit Court, in which
the commission was named as defendant.

â â The imports of coal during the month have been
moderate and fully equal to the demand. Prices
of A ustrallan coal continue to rule low. both spot
and f'U future shipment, while English anthracite
coal tor loading hus advanced on account of hlguer
rates of fresht being asked by shivs to load.
"A small cargo of coal from China arrived in
port during the inontti. which Is claimed to be of
anthracite grade. The experience of the trade
with the litile coal tnat has been imported hitherto
from thai quaiter has been anything but satis
factory."

Explanation.
The antm flies with the wind. The top figure*
Â»t station indicate maximum temperature for the
days: tl,oÂ«e underneath it. If any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and hundredtbs,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect pom s of equal air pressure; iÂ«o-
Iherms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hit;h" means blcta barometric pressure aDd
Is usually accomuani"d by fair weather: "low"
refers :o low pressure, and is usually preceied
and accompKiiied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" us ally firs: appear on the WashlnrtoD
coast. When the pressure is high in the interior
and low along the coasi.and the Isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but wlien the "Inw" is inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the presanre falling to the California coast, warmei
weather may be expected in summer and coldex
weaihpr In winter. The reverse of these conditions
<rill produce an opposite result.

NEW YORK MARKETS.
Kin>ni<!i:il.
NEW YORK, B. V., Sept. 2.â The security mar
kets were buoyant and business was larger than
on any previous day for a long time past. The
overwhelming victory of the Republican party in
Vermont was the main factor at work. Bulls on
slocks were more encouraged by the unprece
dented majority received by the sound-money cau
didates and extended their lines in all depart
ments of the Stock Exchanges. In. addition com
mission-houses reported more inquiry from out of
town sources, and taken altogether the feeling
was decidedly more confident as to the future of
values.
.Money ruled comparatively easy at 4607 per
cent, with the great bulk of the business at 6@6
percent, and foreign exchange weakened some
what, which led to reports of further imports of
gold in the near future. The developments of the
day completely demoralized the bear forces and
the snorts were eag r bidders for the stocks right
up to the close of busings. At the opening the
sta dard slocks bounded anywhere from Vi to 1
per cent.. But part of the gain was .on lost under
free sales to realize profits. Offerings of long
stocks, both for London and local account, were
quickly arm >r)>ed and the market during the after
noon resumed its upward course.
In the late afternoon trading the demand for the
leading specialties was renewed, - nd the market
was stronger than at any previous time of the day.'
Prices Jumped anywhere from % to 5 per cent,

CHICAGO, 111.. Sept. 2.â Business in wheat at
the opening of the market this morning was little
better than at a standstill. Even the usual sulk:
of opening orders seemed restricted and afterward
! the trade became almost stagnant. A slight ad
j vance over yesterday's close was recorded at the
start, a very Hunt volume of arrivals in the North
west, 345 cars, inspiring a little firmness, but
when it was ascertained that these contracted re
ceipts were due to an accident 00 the Great North
ern road, by which, a great number of cars were
] delayed, the firmness disappeared and slight <le-
I cl ne took place.
! Liverpool cables were easy and i.4d lower. Re
i ceipts' at Chicago were 182 cars and 28.550
I bushels were withdrawn from store. Bradstreets
I reported an Increase In the world's available sup
! ply of 1,536,000 bushels, shortly after the an
j nouncement of this reduction prices slumped l^c
I further. lxport clearances were light at 200, 1 12
bushels. Pacific Coast stocks of wheat increased
! 1,500.000 bushels during August. Closing Paris
cables were lower. Antwerp unchanged and Ber
lin %@S/4 mark higher. December wheat opened
from 58s.i.c to 58%. declined to 57% c, closing at
sb@sÃygc, %c under yesterday. intimated re
ceipts for to-morrow 235 cars.

HER BUGGY RIDE
ENDED IN DEATH,
While Driving With a
Friend a Young Widow
Takes Poison.
NO REASON FOR SUICIDE
When William Mackie Watered
the Horse Mrs. Prussia
Emptied the Vial.
UNCONSCIOUS A WHOLE DAY.
"I've Taken Laudanum, Here's My
Purse," She Said, and No Other
Explanatioa.
Oakland Office Sas Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Sept. 2. )
Mrs. Norrca E. Prussia died this after
noon at the home of her mother from the
effect of opium poisoning. The circum
stances preceding her death aie so unus
ual that there is considerable mystery re
garding the reason and cause of her sui
cide.
Yesterday afternoon Mrs. Prussia, who
is a widow residing at 1904 Webster street,
â was over in Alameda driving with Wil
liam Mackie, a real estate man of JEncinal.
Mackie stopped at a saloon and watered
the horse as well as took a drink himself.
When he returned to the bugey he says
Mrs. Prussia said tohim : "I've taken laud
anum. Here is my purse aÂ«id watch."
Mackie saw plainly that she had taken
something, and he at once drove to Dr.
irnith in Alameda. By that time the
woman was unconscious and Dr. Smith
called in Dr. Akers. There was no doubt
that the woman was poisoned and the
doctors treated her accordingly. They
worked over her all night but with no
apparent result and while still unconscious
she was brought to the home of her
mother, where she died this afternoon at
4 o'clock without regaining her conscious
ness.
About an hour before her death Mrs.
Bishop, the mother of Mrs. Prussia, said
her daughter was sufferinc from a fainting
fit, to which she was subject.
"She has been a sufferer from these for
years," she said, "and was brought home
this morning in an unconscious condition.
I do not know what brought it on, or any
thing more than that I was awakened at 2
o'clock this morning with the news.
"The report that she poisoned herself
has no foundation so far as 1 know. W r e
have made a thorough examination, and
have been unable to iind any bottle or
paper that could have contained poison.
No one saw her take any poison or sny
tbine that would cause her to be in such a
condition. None of us have any idea how
she came to be out with the sen'tleman, or
where they were when it happened.
Mrs. Prussia was a well-known music
teacher of this city, being tne daughter
of Mr. and Mrs. Edzar Bishop of 1165
Bru>h street. She lost her husband about
three years ago, and has had the two
children to care for since. She has had
very poor health. At one time it was
feared that siie too would be taken off
with consumption, like her husband, but
she has been better of late.
Dr. Adams, who attended her after she
was brought home, says: I< l was called in
this morning about 9 o'clock, and found
Mrs. Prussia in an insensible condition.
I made efforts to revive her with oxygen
gas, but to no avail, as she died about 4
o'clock this aiternoon without having
gained consciousness. It would be hard
to sey what the cause ot death really was,
but it Will be fully developed at the in
quest, which will be held to-morrow.
"I found no indication whatever that the
lady had been injured in any manner. I
have attended her for some time. She has
a eon and daughter about 10 and 12 years
of age respectively. Mr. and Mrs. Prussia
formerly resided in Stockton and when he
was taken seriously ill he went to Pasa
dena, where he died about three veari
ago." , *
Coroner Baldwin is satisfied that the
case is one of opium-poisoning. "I have
inquired very lully into thi3 case," he said
to-night, "and i am satisfied that death is
the result of her taking laudanum. All
the three doctors who attended her agree
in their diagnosis of the case, and there is
not enough suspicion in my mind to war
rant holding an autopsy.
"Mr. Mackie, with whom she was driv
ing, tells a very straight story, and I hava
no reason to doubt what he says. The
woman undoubtedly tooK a big dose of
poison.
"1 have learned that she did not enjoy
good health, and her father-in-law has in
formed me that she was of a very im
pulsive disposition, and he does not seem
to think it remarkable that she should
have taken poison.
"An inquest will be held to-morrow, and
I have no doubt that there will be testi
mony enough to satisfy everybody that it
is a simple case of suicide. Mackie was in
attendance npon the woman until she
died and seems to be greatly affected, but
if tbete was a love affair between them no
body seems to have heard of it. He is a
single man."
Mr 3. Appel, to whom Mackie drove Mrs.
Prussia after she had taken the fatal dose
of laudanum, said she knew neither of the
parties, but in course of conversation
acknowleged 6he had met Mr. Mackie
once. She was introduced to him, about
four months ago, by a gentleman whose
name she foreets, but Mackie only saw
her once when he wanted her to insure
her property and furniture in his office.
"Some one rang the hell about half- oast
10 last night and shouted, 'Mrs. Apoel!
Open the door quick !' "I opened the door,
and Mr. Mackie asked where my niece
was, that he wanted help, as he had a lady
friend in the buggy and 'she's dead.' I
got my niece out of bed, and they went
out and brought the woman in and laid
her on the hall floor. We saw that she
was pretty baa, and my niece said that a
doctor must be obtained. Mackie went
for Dr. Smith, and afterward I got fright
ened and went too. The doctor came, and
Mackie went to Oakland and brought the
woman's mother. They took her away
about 5 o'clock this morning."
Mrs. Appel is very much put out at the
occurrence. She says she cannot under
stand why Mackie, who is a straneer to
her, should drive so far out of his road to
bring the body of a strange woman into
her bouse. She is more than angry, as
hlie points out that be could have obtained
medical assistance ten minutes after the
occurrence.
MUST HAVE FUNDS.
Ladies' Kellef Society Will Have to
Close Their Home If Not Â
Assisted.
OAKLAND, Cal , Sept. 2.â The Ladies'
Relief Society, which conducts the Chil
drens* and Old Ladies' homes at Temescal,
holds its monthly meeting to-morrow
(Thursday) afternoon, and the ladies will
have to face the question as to how they
are to continue the worx they are now
doing at an expense of from $900 to $1000
a month on an income of not over $SUO a
montn.
Tnis is the oldest charity in the city,
having been organized more than thirty
years aeo, anu has grown from a small
beginning until now they have three large
buildings, with twenty-seven old and in
firm ladies and ninety children, between
the ages of two weeks and 14 years, shel
tered at their home, for whom they must
provide food, clothes and warmth. *
They have been compelled by the lacK
of funds to close their doors and refuse ad
mittance to any more, although the de
mand continues lor places. For some
years the State assisted by sharing the ex
pense of keeping ud theOldLaOies' Home,
but at the last session of the Legislature
this was withdrawn. It amounted to
about $250 a month. Other sources of in
come were cut down nearly as much, thus
putting the management to their wits' end
to know what to do. Matters have grown
worse, and now somethine must be done
at once or the number cared for will have
to be reduced.
The ladies, therefore, are gome to be
compelled to make a plea to the public for
monthly subscriptions. They ask those
able to give freely, and those less able to
give as they can afford it. that the little
ones and the old may have proper care and
shelter during the coming winter weather.

to be given Saturday niuht to raise funds
with which to purchase a plat in the local

FOOTE IS FOR TARPEY,
First Broken Front for Years
Among Alameda County
Democrats.
Warren EDglish Claims Victory and
the Fight Will Be to a Finish in
Vallejo Next Friday.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Sept. 1. \
The Third Congressional Democratic
Convention will meet at Vallejo next Fri
day, and although enough of the party
have not yet been found ln this county to
hold a ratification meeting since the Chi
cago convention, it is presumed that with
the aid of proxies enough votes will be
mustered to nominate a congressman.
The convention will be composed of the
fame delegates that vrere elected to attend
the State convention.
Considerable interest is being shown in
the convention by the Populists, and they
will have their committee on band to
bring about fusion if the opportunity to
do so is presented. Although the Pop
ulists want Vann he has somewhat con
fused them by handing in his resignation
to State Chairman Wardell.
The fight will be between Warren Eng
lish and M. F. Tarpey, and although
every attempt is being made to preserve a
pleasant front there is much bitter feel
ing. As far as Alameda County is con
cerned the line will be drawn just as it was
at the last primary with one exception,
â¢nd that exception is the bigeest bomb
shell that has fallen into the D mocratic
camp for many moons.
W. W. Foote has announced that be is
the friend and supporter of Mr. Tarpey.
This is the first break in the solid front of
the Alameda stalwarts and it has brought
confusion into the camp and has upset all
calculations.
"I am for Mr. Tarpey," said W. W
h oote to-day, "as the result of a promise
made in Chicago."
When asked for his reason Mr. Foote
declined to go any deeper into the subject.
Whether Mr. Foote will carry the delega
tion to the man whom he "is pledged to
support, or whether he will confine him
self to his individual vote is not known.
R. M. Fitzgerald, who is the recognized
leader of the opposition to whatever W,
W. Foote champions, will not be at the
convention, as he will not return from the
East for several days, but as it is known
he is for Tarpey it is probable that his visit
has been timed so that be will not have to
attend a convention where he will have to
vote with Mr. Foote.
In speaking of the situation to-day War
ren B. English said : "I expect to be nomi
nated on the first ballot, and do not an
ticipate any amount of opposition. If the
Populists will fuse with us we would be
pleased. However, I think that matter
must be left with the State executive
committee-, for I am afraid we cannot
come to any definite conclusion in Vai-
Jejo, though of course we will try. If they
give us the indorsement I think there is
no question but that 1 will beat Hilborn
out by possibly 3000 majority. La?t time
we were up he defeated me by about 2500.
Vann received a vote of over 5000, so with
our combined strength we aie all right in
this district"
It is believed that Foote will place
Tarpey in nomination, and if this were to
be true there will be a very lively conven
tion.
HE WOULD TESTIFY.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 3, 1896.
CAR-GUARD THAT
PICKS UP WHEELS
Exciting Ride of a Cyclist
Caught by an Elec
tric Car.
SAVED BY HIS NERVE
Pushed Ahead at a Rapid Rate
Several Hundred Feet on
Grove Street.
SUPT. GRIM SEEMS HAPPY.
Hs Long Experiments With Car-
Guards Has at Last Resulted in a
Device of Good Service.
Oakland Office San Francipco Call,)
908 Broadway, Sept. 2. f
Henry Masterson of Berkeley experi
enced a wild and dangerous bicvele ride
this morning that eclipses any of the sen
sational adventures of the riders in the
great relay race now in progress across the
continent.
The experience to which reference is
made is enough like a circus trick to justify
its practice by some one seeking sensa
tional honors, though it is hardly likely
to become a common form of coasting
even among expert wheelmen.
Masterson was riding along Grove street,
and was keeping in the middle of the
electric-road track. He paid no attention
to the car that was fol owing him, and the
motorman rang the bell to warn the
cyclist. Maaterson turned off the track,
and then decided to give the car a race.
He spurted, and although the cars go at a
good rate along Grove street the cyclist
was able to makn the pace.
Finally Masterson concluded that as the
track was smoother than the rest of the
road he would again use it.
Then took place a feat that reflects
much credit on a car guard and on the
coolness of Masterson. As he ran on the
track the car was so close that it struck
his stern wheel. Everybody expected to
see the rider ground to pieces, and there
was as much excitement as if be bad been.
The car-guard, however, came to the
rescue. It scooped up the hind wheel and
lifted it about a foot above the ground.
Quick as lightning Masterson took his feet
from the pedals and attended to his wheel.
He was so alert that he kept his wheel up
right, although be was sitting at a big
angle and was in danger of being pitched
over the handle-bar.
This was witnessed for several hundred
feet, ttie remarkable spectacle of a man
ridjng in front of a swift-traveling electric
car, witn the hind wheel caught by the
scoop guard and steering safely with the
front wheel.
As soon as possible the car was atopped
and when its speed first slackened Master
son calmly placed his feet on the pedals
and wheeled the bicycle off the guard and
pursued his way out Grove street
Superintendent Grim of the Grove-street
road has been devoting considerable time
to the perfection of lenders and he con
siders that he has certainly produced a
guard that ought to evoke the gratitude of
wheelmen at least
A CONTEST WITH GLOVES
In the Encinai Yacht Club Boat
house Between Tarpey and
Randolph.
The Resignation of the Assistant
Librarian and Other Brief
Items.
ALAMEDA, Cal.. Sept. 2.â The Encinai
Athletic Club, an offshoot from the Yacht
Club, confined to sons and relations of the
latter, held a boxing contest last night in
the clubhouse. The participants were
Messrs. Tarpey and Randolph, sous of two
prominent citizens. Invitation cards were
issued by the members, so that a good
attendance was secured, and the contribu
tion box, placed under the eyes of each of
the onlookers, received a good round sum.
To put some ginger into the affair the
story was current that the contestants had
had a difference over a lady, and that Ran
dolph had challenged Tarpey to a duel
with the gloves. The affair last night was
of the mild order, though four-ounce
gloves were used. Charles Russell acted
as referee until after the fifth round, when
Dr. C. L. Tisdale took a hand, and high
above the din his voice proclaimed that
the fighting must end then and there.
The referee proclaimed the match a
draw, a decision that did not meet the
views of the spectators, who thought Tar
pey entitled to the judgment in his favor.
Library Meeting.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Sept 2.â The library
trustees at their meeting last night ap
pointed FranK Bordwell assistant librarian
in the place of W. R. Bacon. Bacon ten
dered his resignation to enter on a course
of dental Btudy and a letter of recom
mendation is to be given him by the
trustees.
Died at Sea.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Sept. 2.â Further par
ticulars to hand go to show that C. C.
Brock, who died on the Alaska Packing
Association's vessel Merom, succumbed to
dropsy of the heart. Broc* died while the
Merom was icebound for twenty-six days
in Bering Sea, opposite Bristol Bay.
CONSTABLES' DUTY.
The Matter Hay Be Taken Into
Court Soon.
OAKLAND, Cal., Sept. 2.â Sheriff C. B.
White has this to say regarding the pro
posed plan of the constables of the county
refusing to take prisoners committed by
Justice courts from thence to the jail:
"I believe the constables propose to take
this stand because they receive no re
muneration for taking prisoners to the
County Jail after commitment, I cannot
sne why I should be compelled io undergo
a hardship of the same kind. If I should
have to bring a prisoner in here from
lrvington, for instance, I would receive no
more remuneration than a constable would.
Besides, I do not think that the constabl â¢
could legally leave prisoners in the Jus
tice's court and expect me to go after those
prisoners. Ido not think I have anything
to do with such prisoners uniil they are
delivered to me at the jail."
Under Sheriff Harlow, speaking on the
subject, said: "The constables have no
more right to leave a prisoner committed
to the County Jail in a Justice's office
than they would to leave him in a grocery
or a saloon. The constables are the offi
cers of the Justices' Court, and it is their
duty to carry out the orders of the Jus
tices in the matter of committing prison
ers. Tney must turn over prisoners to the
Sheriff, and the Sheriff is required to take
and receive prisoners into custody oniy
when they are turned over to him by the
constables" at the jail."

MUST HAVE A
HOME FOR WAIFS,
Big Increase in the Number
of Abandoned Chil
dren.
MRS. PRESCOTT'S PLAINT
All the Local Homes Are Full
and She Keeps a
Nursery.
LADIES TO TAKE ACTION.
Mrs. Captain McFee of the Salvation
Army Will Probably Be Encour
aged to Open a Shelter.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, )
908 Broadway, Sept 2. |
More children have been abandoned in
Oakland during the past few months than
the many homes in this neighborhood can
accommodate. About every other day
some little waif is cast adrift and taken to
the secretary of the Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Children, and now
Mrs. Prescott has commenced sending
them to ban Francisco shelters and homes.
To those who are familiar with the West
Oakland Home, the Temescal Home and
the Chabot Home it will appear strange
that these refuges have been forced to close
their doors against newcomers. No chil
dren have been received at West Oakland
for two months, at Temescal for three,
while the Chabot will not receive them un
less a quaran tee be given that they shall
only stay a few days.
At the present time Mrs. Prescott has a
small orphanage at her own apartments.
She has "Nobody's baby,' : that figured at
the exposition, and she has kept her so
long that she does not now desire to part
with her. Then there is little Helene,
who was kept at her otlice in a basket, and
the latest is Annie Hilbert, a lovely child
1 year of age, who was brought over by a
San Francisco woman, placed out to board
several months ago and abandoned.
"Twenty-one little ones have been heart
le>siy abandoned during the past few
weeks," said Mrs. Prescott to-day. "Some
have been left on doorsteps, some have
been brought here by those with whom
they were placed and who could not keep
them longer, but the most common way is
to leave them in my office when I am out.
il lt is very necessary that we should
have a receiving home for foundlings in
this city. Disposition can always be made
of abandoned children in the course of
time, but, it is imperative that there should
be some place where they can be cared for
till permanent homes can be provided lor
them.
"Several society ladies have promised to
take the matter up and they are now wait
ing for others to return when the matter
will be taken up. A parlor meeting will
be called and Mm. Captain McFee of the
Salvation Army will probably be the one
to carry out their ideas. The children's
work of the Salvation Army seems to be
as practical and economical and thorough
as any system tiiatcau be found, and they
will probably be accorded proper encour
agement to open a children's shelter in
Oakland.
"For some time past I have had to take
my waifs to San Francisco, but they do
not altogether appreciate children irom
other cities and besides it wastes much
valuable time that could be saved if we
Lad a home here."
Electric Road Wins.
OAKLAND, Cal., Sept. 2.-The efforts
of Street Superintendent M. K. Miiler to
compel t\ J. Woodward, receiver of the
Highland Park and Fruitvale Electric
RaiiroAd to keep in repair and sprinkle
between the rails have proved futile.
A demurrer was made to his complaint,
claiming the ordinance requiring a com
pany to sprinkle between its* rails was un
constitutional, as it amended the fran
chise, which imposed no such conditions.
This view was sustained by the court and
the complaint dismissed.
Favor* Public Farks.
OAKLAND, Cal., Sept. 2.â There was a
largely attended meeting of the Board of
Trade at the Exposition building this
evening. It was in the interest of public
narks in this city. The principal speakers
were Superintendent John McLaren of
Golden Gale Park and A. D. Pryal, the
county Horticultural Commissioner. A
number of oihers, however, spoke on the
subject.
Technical Defense.
OAKLAND, Cal., Sept. 2.â County Au
ditor Myron A. Whidden has presented a
technical defense to the indictments charg
ing embezzlement and mutilation oi pub
lic records, and as a consequence the
whole Grand Jury has been summoned to
anpear before Judge Greene on September
14 at i p. m.
A Fat Fee.
OAKLAND, Cal. Sept. 2.â Dr. D. D.
Crowiey, in his suit against the executors
of the will of Philip Boogar, for a $2500
fee for performing the operation of attach
ing the ends of an intestine perforated by
a bullet, was awarded the full amount by
a jury.
Death by Dissipation.
OAKLAND, Cal., Bept. 2.â Charles Fur
ness, a young man of good family, who
was barkeeper at the Newland House for
some years, died at the Receiving Hospi
tal from general debility, brought on by

an inveterate cigarette smoker.
AT THE CITY THEATERS,
Bright Kathryn Kidder Retains
Her Hold on Baldwin
Audiences.
The Present Season of Opera at the
Tivoli Drawing to a
Close.
The theaters are suffering this week
from the large attendances at the Me
chanics' Fair, which naturally leave fewer
people to go round at the playhouses.
Some of the attractions, however, seem to
hold their own, despite the counter at
tractions of the fair.'
The brilliantly staged "Mine. Sans
Gene" is continuing its initial success at
the Baldwin Theater. Miss Kathryn
Kidder has already become a decided
favorite with her audiences, and several
other members of the cast have become
popular, particularly Augustus Cook as
Napoleon.
At the Columbia the "Social Trust" is
proving its ability to stand a second
week's run. It will be replaced next week
by "The Wife."
In the Tivoli's revival of "Rigoletto"
Sign or de Vries is doing as brilliantly
artistic work in the title role as when the
opera was first produced by the present
company. Nina Bertini Humphreys is a
graceful, girlish Gildte, who is quite satis
factory vocally, and Abramoff is good in
the basso role. The performance as a
whole is thoroughly enjoyable.
"Ernani" has been giving John J.
Raffael a chance to please his audience
in the role of the King. Mrae. Natali and
Michalena have been winning a good deal
of applause as Elvira and Ernani respect
ively. To the regret of music-lovers it is
announced that next week will be the last
tor a time of the present season of opera.
Until then Carl Martens will continue to
conduct in place of Gnstav Hinj;chs.
The thriiling incidents in "Held in
Slavery" are proving thoroughly attrac
tive at the Grand Opera-house, and Lottie
Williams and E. J. Herron's humorous
contributions to the performance help to
give snap and go to the play.
Friends and admirers of the Alcazar
Theater and its new company have at
tended in force this weeK. The play,
"Turned Up," goes a good deal more
smoothly than on the opening night and
the performance arouses plenty of ap
plause.
Filson and Erroll's comedy, "Men
Versus Women," is proving the leading
feature of the new turns at the Orpheum
this week. The rest of the programme
contains the usual amount of popular
features.
Next Monday the California Theater
will reopen for the season with Steve
Brodie, in bis popular play, "On the
Bowery."
ON MORTGAGE TAXATION,
Able Debate by Members of the
Federated Improvement
Clubs.
The Board of Health's Request for a
Sanitary Appropriation Also
Discussed.
The San Francisco Federation of Im
provement Clubs met at B'nai B'rith Hall
last evening. Several important proposi
tions came up before the organization
and were discussed in a very lively man
ner.
The report of the committee on creden
tials recommending the admission of the
following delegates from the Mission Five
mile Improvement Club was presented by
F. W. Van Reynegom and adopted : Fran
cis Feely, H. E. Doyal, E. N. Toreblo,
Charles Luttriuger and M. H. Levy. The
recommendation that Messrs. Sullivan,
King, Ladd, Nolan and Hammond be ad
mitted from the Fourth-street club was
also approved.
A motion laid over from the last meet
ing that the organization meet twice a
month instead of once a month evoked a
warm debate. ,
The majority favored the idea, as this
was near election time, and the motion
was adopted. Hereafter the Federated
Improvement Clubs will meet on the first
and third Wednesdays of -every month.
The report of the committee on public
works, presented by Dr. A. Rottanzi,
stated that the principal matter under
consideration was the Pesthouse.
"We believe," said Dr. Rottanzi, "that
the condition of the present Pesthouse is
such that it should be torn down. San
Francisco should certainly take charge of
it* own lepers, bat should not be made
the dumping ground for all the lepers of
the State."
The secretary of the Board of Health,
he said, had sent the committee a letter
giving certain statistics in regard to the
Pepthouse, in which it was stated that the
number of lepers was few, but that the
present Pesthouse was not built for any
but contagious diseases. The Board of
Health condemns the entire quarters, and
lays the blame upon the Board of Super
visors. .
The committee recommended that the
inhabitants of the Pesthouse should be
removed to temporary quarters suitable
for their maintenance until a proper in
stitution could be built for them.
The committee further recommended
that a memorial be presented to the Gov
ernment, asking that work on the new
PostoQice be begun at once, in order to
give honest men who are out of employ
ment a chance to earn bread for them
selves and families. The present Post
office the report declared to be totally
inadequate and commodious quarters were
absolutely necessary. Dr. Sallield moved
an amendment that a $10,000 appropria
tion be asked for to build a pesthouse on
the Almshouse Tract. This idea created
such a furor from those opposed to that
location that the matter was laid on the
table.
A motion was presented that no club be
admitted into the organization until
ninety days after its organization. An
amendment to this reduced the time to
sixty days, and an amendment to the
amendment reduced the time to thirty
days. The question excited heated de
bate and Dr. Sallield iinally moved as a
substitute for the whole that the matter
be laid over for two weeks, which motion
was carried.
This was done in order to permit a num
ber of clubs who are eager to enter imme
diately the privilege of sodoins. There
fore, it is probable that after the meeting
of September 16 no club will be admitted
until it has been in existence thirty days.
The question that excited the most in
terest during the evening was whether
the report of the committee on law and
legislation condemning the adoption o
the first amendment to the constitution
exempting mortgages from taxation
should be adopted.
President Phelan was vigorous in his
objection to the club's putting itself on
record against the amendment. John R
Aitken and Dr. Sal held were as strongly
in favor of it. L. J. Dwyer took the same
position as Phelan.
The general argument of those in favo
of the amendment was that if mortgage
be exempted from taxation the bank
would lower their rates of interest; tha
they now not only add the tax to the inf
terest, but a fraction more to cover the un
certainty of the tax rate. It was claimed'
that this fraction is an injustice to the'
borrower. "
Against this it was argued that interests
was higher before the new constitutions
was adopted than it is now. Several argu- t
ments to prove this method of reasoning
fallacious were made by the other side."
It was finally found necessary to postpone'
the consideration of the proposition for
two weeks, the various delegates being in
vited in the meantime to brine the matter
before their clubs.
The following resolution was brought
beiore the body and adopted unanim
ously:
Resolved, That the commlttecon parks be in
structed to conier witn the Board of Super
visors and the Board of Park Commission
ers with a view of making proper provision
by the City and Commissioners tor planting
ornamental trees on the line of the only boule
vard irom the park to the Cityâ Golden Gate
avenue.
The committee on public utilities rec
ommended that the organization give its
hearty support and co-operation to the
Board of Health in securing an extra ap
propriation by the Board of Supervisors
for improving tlie sanitary condition of

TIBURON WILL ENTERTAIN
Monster Clam Bake and Athletic Sports
Sunday Next.
The citizens of Tiburon are making ex
tensive preparations for a clam bake and
grand celebration to be held next Sunday
at noon in their hospitable little city. A
meeting of those people interested in the
clam bake met iast evening and organized
as "The Tiburon Clam Bane Association,"
vith the following officers: President, J.
O'Connell: secretary, Thomas Mitchell;
treasurer, N. Henseu. The association
appointed the folio wing committees to
handle the "bake: Masters of ceremon
ies, H. Unnaand Gus Scheller; games and
tug-of-war, William Finlayson; boat races,
J. Am aral ; caterer, George Crowell ; music,
W. C. Lewis.
Rows of tables and benches are being
erected to accommodate at least 1000 per
sons who are expected to be the guests of
Titurou Sunday. Everything will be
free, as the townsfolk have determined to
be hosts' in the fullest sense of the word.
The object of the clambake and jollifica
tion is to show all visitors what kind of a
place Tiburon is. or more correctly, to
make San Franciscans feel that they "have
a kindly neighbor across the bay. The
citizens committee has issued invitations
to its friends.
Music, tug-of-war, boat races and ath
letic games will be a feature of the enter
tainment or the guests. The San Fran
cisco and North Pacific Railway Company
is willing to lend a helping hand to the
"bake, 1 as it encourages a desirable class
of people to travel on the steamers.
Bryan Silver Club.
The Bryan Silver Club of the Fortieth As
sembly District held a rousing and enthu
siastic meeting last night. Election for per
manent secretary was the first order of
business, and George M. Kelly and Cornelius
E. Mahoney were unanimously chosen as re
cording and corresponding secretary respec
tively. Joseph P. Kelly, candidate for Congress
from the Fifth Congressional District; Sidney
Van WycJt, M. C. Hassett, T. P. Riordan and
others addressed the meeting.

ATHLETES' ASSOCIATION.
Various Clubs Unite Under One Board
of Directors for Protection.
Representatives of the various athletic j
clubs, comprising the San Francisco, the j
National, the Acme, the Oakland, the j
Manhattan, the Occidental, the North :
End, the Columbian and the Olympic, J
met last night in response to the invita- j
tion issued by George Ferris of the Man- j
hattan Club with the object of forming an i
association of clubs by electing delegates
who, when properly accredited, shall form
a board of directors.
At the meeting last night tnere were |
seven clubs represented by delegates and
an informal discussion was had covering
lhe aims and objects of the association,
but in consequence of there not being a
full attendance no final action was taken, â¢
other than the electing of (ieorge Ferris j
president and William Herbert secretary, j
Both of them will be only temporary I
officers, however, 10 hold until the next
meeting of the delegates.
The pian of this association, so far as it
has been discussed, is that the association
shall not have any immediate jurisdiction
over the separate action of any of the
clubs in their arrangements ior matches
or other sports. Bat it is intended to sup
port the weaker clubs aeainst undue in
terference on the part of the authorities or |
others who, through jealousy, might try
to belittle their standing as legitimate
athletic clubs.
Under the proposed rules the smaller
clubs will have an equal show with the |
Manhattan or Occidental, which clubs i
have a good reputation for honorable
sport.

ments of human remains were found.
Here and there mangled and often
charred bits of anatomy were distinguished
by the workmen and laid reverently in a
little pile where a human foot and a
Chinese slipper were the only distinguish
able pieces.
Then as one of the men was plying his
pick vigorou-iy to complete a foundation
ditch deep down to solid earth below that
softened in the crater torn out under the
mixing-bouse the tool struck something
peculiarly yielding. He was horrified to

My hands were completely covered with Ec-

up, and away from the fire. My husband had to
dress and undress me like a baby. I tried the
best physicians, but their medicines gave me no
relief, and drove me almost crazy. I was ad-
vised to try Cuticvra Remedies, and did so,
although my husband had to go twenty miles to
get them. As soon as he got back, I need the
Cuticdba, and in Jive minute* after the Jlrnt
application I teat perfectly taÂ»y, and ilept
soundly all that night. Before I commenced
using the Cuticuka Remedies I could get no

membered the body had left its ghastly
work upon the blackened, shapeless mass.
It might have been one of t c eight
Chinese; it probably was. And it might
have been John McNutty, tne foreman of
the mixing-bouse that had stood above
that very spot. At any rate there is un
certainty. Four white men had been
killed. Two, John Freitas and Garcia
Mortirzo, the carmen, were found near
their car unmutilated and were easily
identified. W. F. Crater, foreman of the
packing-house, though horribly mangled
and burned, was identified. But yester
day, afier a more careful examination of
the other human fragments lying in the
moist, cold brick vault of the empty nitre
house, no one could say that anypartof
them was the remains of the fourth white
man.
Three Chinese heads had been found and
accordingly three small, rouch wood cof
fins were equally filled wish the remain
ing grewsome bits and early shipped to
this City, where in a day or two the pagan
death rites will be observed for the eight
unfortunates.
To-day there will be a double funeral in
the little village of Pinole. There two
desolated homes mourn the loss of hus
band and father. The public school flag
and two others sadly drooping at halt
mast proclaimed yesterday that
a great sorrow bad visited the
small community, while a bit of
crape fastened to the front door of a new
meeting hall, scarcely completed and un
touched yet by the painter's brush, told
its own story of a recently organized and
hopeful local council ot the Ancient Order
oi Foresters saddened in the dawn of its
prosperity by the loss of two of its stanch
est supporters, for John Freitas and
Manuel Mortirzo had been actively inter
ested in the completion of that new hall
sosoontobe darkened by ihe shadow of
their death.
In Oakland there will be another funeral,
that of Winfield S. Crater. Between the
two few men will be left at the works, and
none of the processes requiring labor and
attention will be in operation during the
day.
The necessary guards will, however,
remain in constant watchfulness to prevent
further damage from the dan erous â¢ ils
still on hand. But the great nitric acid
works, the largest in the western part of
America, will ftop, and these ominous
reddish-yellow vitrous vapors that pour
all aay irom the tall brick chimney on the
hill will cease.
Twenty-five extra men were added
temporarily to the force of about 100 white
men and eighty Chinese employed about
the works. With rapid and teilinu' energy,
they all applied themselves to the work of
repairing, cleaning away and rebuilding.
On Friday even a larger number will be
at work, while all the possible processes
and the shipment of dynamite will go on
as usual.
Prominent in the little colony of pow
der-workers, because of his long experi
ence n the business, his years and his
I osition, is John McLean, the foreman,
who haa been employed at the dynamite
works of the California Powder Company
for over twenty-two years and has been
present at all the explosions during that
time. He is also one of the most trusted
men in the employ of the company.
Years ago he was captain of the oid
.Liberty Hose Company of this City and
to-day the men affectionately refer to him
as "Captain Jimmy." When "the boys"
at the works built the new hall for the
Joresters of Pinole they elected their fore
man financial secretary of the lodge.
Small of stature, with twinkling eyes
and an inimitable, picturesque way of
talking, "Captain Jimmy" is a character.
"It was in '75 we had our first explosion.
1 hat was when we were on the other side
of the bay, near the Almshouse tract. No
men were killed. No, you bet notâ ran
Jlke .the whole lot of us. Ask Judd
of the Hicks-Judd Company about it.
Does he remember it? Well, you can rope
me and brand me for a maverick if he
doesn't; he was foreman of the nitro
glycerine house at the time.
"Late in '81 we came over to this side,
and in 82 we had our second explosion
since the works started along in '73
Men killed? Why, that one was a stun
ner. One white man and forty China
menâall in the packing-houseâ went like
a pen of sheep. Any other explosions?
You bet. Had one along about '87.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 3, 1896.
Then in ;92; 92 we had another, but no men
were killed. Last year she went ur again;
took five write men and nine Chinamen.
And then we had this one; foui white
men and eignt Chinamen. No men were
killed while we were on the other side of
tne bay.
"I don't recall ail the dates between '82
and '92, but all toM we haven't lost more
than rifteen white men in the last twemy
two years. It is not such a dan -erous
business after all. Safest business in the
world to work at until s >c goes, and then
it's all up with the fellow that's there.
"Save l a Chinaman's life that time in
'82. He'd been lazinp and I booted him a
couple in the slack of the pants, and he
lit out instead oi going on back to work in
the mixing-house. Forty went up. He
was the only one escaped.
"Came back after a while and went to
work again, but couldn't hire that fellow
to lakÂ»" a job in the mixing-house, and he
was a mighty good Chinaman there. So 1
soaked him with all the hardest jobs on
the place, one after the other, but he only
grinned and said, 'Me neaD likee; velly
easy work.'
"Yesterday while tne men were dig
ging among the wreckage of the mixing
house they uncovered a cat and a kitten,
never hurt a bit; everything else shat
tered to pieces. Cat went out last night
and got run over by a freight train. Kit
ten's got eight liv^s left."

THE CIRCUS HERE.
Grand Street Parade ThiÃ Morning
and Opening 1 erformance at Night
in Central Park.
The greatest circus that has ever come
to San Francisco will arrive this morning
in three special trains that have been the
marvel of the country through which
they passed. To be more exact, two big
shows consolidated in one monster aggre
gation of star artists, hippodromes,
menageries, etc., is coming. For this
year the people of San Francisco are to
have an opportunity of seeing the great
Forepaugh and Sells brothers shows.
Though the unweildy mass of freight,
representing tents, animals, horses, prop
erties, wardrobes and brilliant chariots for
street pageants will not be here until late
in the morning, there will .be a parade
immediately afterward and a Derformance
in the evening in Central Park.
The parade will be made through the
City at noon, the pageant starting from
Central Pai kat 11 :30 and mnrching down
Mission street to Third, up Third to Mar
ket, down Market to Montgomery, down
Montgomery to Washington, up Wash
ington to Kearny and out that thorough
fare to Market and Eighth.
Great things are promised for this
parade. There will be over 300 wild ani
mals in line, with beautiful trained horses
and many of the arlbts, all of which will
convey some idea of the strength of the
double circus.
One million will read "Mechanics' Fair

PECULIAR CASE
OF R. L PAYNTER.
Found Unconscious With
All the Gas Jets
Turned On.
WILL LIKELY RECOVER.
He Registered at a Hotel Under
the Name ot James McGraw
of Oakland.
HIS WIFE AWAY ON A VISIT.
All His Friends Scut the Idea oi
Attempted Suicide and Talk
of Foul Play.
R. L. Paynter, collector for W. A. Car
roll, broker, 328 Montgomery street, was
found in an unconscious cond.tion in his
room at the Hotel Becker, 18 Mason street,
about 9 o'clock ye-terday morning. The
gas was turned on irom every jet and it
looked as if suicide had been intended.
He was taken to the Receiving Hospital
in the patrol-wagon and every effort was
made by Dr. Fitzgibbon to restore him to
consciousness, and last night he was pro
nounced out of anger.
About 3 o'clock yesterday morning
Paynter went to the hotel and engaged a
room from George Fisher, the night clerk.
He registered as "James McGraw, Oak
land." He appeared to be perfectly sober
and nothing out of the ordinary was no
ticed in his manner or speech.
After engaging the room Paynter went
to 501 a Franklin street, where his mother,
sUter and brother-in-iaw live. Paynter's
wife has been visiting friends at theColusa
House, 101014 Washington street, Oak
land, since last Friday night and he had
been sharing bis brother-in-law's room.
What passed between them is not known,
but Paynter left the house and returned to
his room in the hotel.
The nigbt Dorter noticed about 5 o'clock
yesterday morning that Paynter's room
was empty and the window was open, so
that be must have returned after that
hour. About 9 o'clock one of the servants
smelled gas escaping from his room and he
was found unconscious in bed.
What led to his Identity were some of
Carroll's business cards that were found
in his pockets. Carroll was communica
ted with, and he notified Paynter's rela
tives. His mother was soon at the hos
pital, and in the afternoon his sister and
brother-in-law and other relatives called
to see him.
All the members of the family were very
uncommunicative, as they were afraid of
the papers publishing anything about
him. His mother scouted the idea of sui
cide and expressed the belief that her son
had met with foul play, but from whom or
why she had not the remotest idea. It
was not robbery, as the moneyâ s3â he
had in his pocket when he engaged the
room Â«vas found where he had put it and
nothing else bad been taken.
"My son is 26 years of age, and has been
married five years," said Mrs. Paynter,
J.EV7 TO-DAT-DRT GOODS-
"and he and his wife have been devoted
to each other. They bave no children.
Friday night she went to visit friends in
Oakland and be was to have gone there
last night to stay until this morning, and
then bring her home. He left home with
that intention.
"He is steady in his habits, is not in
financial troubles, is happy in his domestic
relations, and I cannot see why he should
attempt to commit suicide. I cannot ex
plain why he went to the hotel and took a
room under an assumed name, but I am
sure he will be able to explain it satis
factorily."
Paynter regained consciousness last
night, but bis relatives positively refused
to allow him to make a statement, his
father even insisting that no stranger
should be permitted to go near his bed
side and treating inquirers with scant
courtesy.
Paynter's wife did not mafce her appear
ance at the hospital, although his mother
said early in the afternoon that she had
been sent for.
She was in Oakland with her mother,
Mrs. William Kane, at the Colusa, 1010Â»^
Washington street, where she was seen
and in:ormed of her husband's rash act.
"Oh, dear, 1 would like to expose that
woman. She in the cau*e of all our trou
bles," were the words she uttered when
she heard the news. Realizing, however,
what she had said she refused to go fur
ther, and asked for information as to his
condition and whereabouts and whether
she bad been sent for. She was greatly
agitated, and it was with d;fficulty t at
she restrained herself from a passionate
outbreak against "that woman. 1 '
Paynter was in charge of M. Brown &
Sons' branch paper-house here for some
time and was giver, to late hour", but was
not consid. red a drinking man. He has
been married five years and has a very
pretty little wife. They resided at the
Palmer House here and at other places for
several years. It was during this time
tnat he met a Mrs. Lottie Ci zzena, who
was the woman reierred to by Mrs. Paynter
in her first outbreak.
Mr. and Mrs. Cozzens have a 10-year-old
daughter and left here a year "ago ana
took tne Lazell House at Mason and Geary
streets, San Francisco. It was not long
before Mr. and Mrs. Paynter decided to go
to the City to reside and she insisted" on
going to Cozzens as she would know some
one, but he rather held back. But he gave
in and now she counts that as her fatal
mistake. About eigbt months ago Mr.
Paynter and Mrs. Cozzens disappeared and
the next heard of them was from Los
Angeles.
Cozzens, who was away at the time, \7as
sent for and Mrs. Paynter returned to her
mother. A couple of months later she
was taken seriously ill, and on being in
formed he came to her. He did not re
main lon., however, but a^ain went away
It is said Mrs. Cozzens is deeply in love
with Paynter, and that since he has been
under her influence he has taken to drink
ing heavily. He is believed to have be
come despondent and to escape it all he
took bis life.
One of Paynter's visitors last night was
a young lady, who told Steward Mogan to
ask Paynter's mother if she could be al
lowed to see him. Sne gave her name as
Miss Cozzens. Mogan took the message
and Mrs. Paynter gave her the necessary
permission. She remained beside him
while Mrs. Paynter went home to supper
A young man employed in Carroll's
office, who called at the hospital last
night, said that Paynter was a partner of
Carroll's.
