HART STANDS BY HIS SHIP
A Confirmation of the
Story Received From
Sacramento.
THE MYSTERY AGAIN SEEN
AT THE CAPITAL
It Makes Its Appearance in the
Company of the Decep
tively Brilliant Venus.
JOKERS MAKE GENEROUS PUR
CHASES OF FIRE BALLOONS.
More New and Interesting Particulars Regarding
the Local Invention Given by the Ex-
Attorney-General.
Either the reputed airship is one of the most gigantic hoaxes of the age, or it is
one of the most wonderful advances made in mechanical science, and is the solution of
the preat problem of aerial locomotion which has enlisted the inventive genius of
many centuries.
Whichever it ultimately proves to be, the subject is to-day the all-engrossing topic.
Greetings are tuned to this key; heated arguments are evolved out of it; wagers are
laid, and even physical strife has been engendered over the question whether or not
there realiy exists a successful aerial traveler.
Though there were many new and interesting developments yesterday, nothing
has yet been brought to light that definitely and conclusively solves the mystery, and
speculation continues as absorbing as for the past week or more.
Ex-Attorney-General Hart in an interview fully confirmed his interview of the
day before and added much interesting information to the first statement he made.
Among other things he substantiated thd first reports concerning the airship wbicn
came from Sacramento by affirming on the authority of the inventor that the airship
was actually over Sacramento when the people there claimed to have seen it.
Sacramento, according to reliable witnesses, was again visited by the aerial
vision last night, which put Venus into the shade by the more brilliant glow of its
lights. â¢
Considerable sport was enjoyed by practical jokers last night in dispatching fire
balloons skyward, but they had no more the appearance of the alleged lights of the
aerial mystery than the dull glare of a candle resembles that of an incandescent light.
Venus again beguiled people at som3 points, but her deceptive charms have^vi
dently been shorn of much of their power by the publication of the story of how
people had Leen mistaking her for her earthly and more interesting rival.
HART CONFIRMS THE STORY
FROM SACRAMENTO.
General Hart was as reticent yesteraay as on the day previous regarding the iden
tity of the reputed airship's inventor or his whereabouts, but was more definite in his
statements as to the identits* of the flying machire, whose secrets are now reposing in
his breast. His words were the first uttered by any reliable person positively con
.necting the invention in his charge with the peregrinating lights seen in the heavens
at various places during the past week.
"As I stated before," said tne ex-Attorney-General, "I have not myself seen the
machine in action or at rest, and I cannot at this time reveal the names of the persons
connected with its invention and construction for the reasons already stated. You
know the idea now is not to get it patented, but to use it for war purposes.
"I do Know, however, that it made a flight last night and was seen at East Oak
land by a lady, Mrs. Taylor, the wife of W. J. Taylor, who is a bookkeeper and who
lives in East Oakland. Siie saw not only the lights, but an outline of the ship. It
was also seen by others in the same locality. Ido not know what the movements of
the machine are to be at any particular time, but I was told by my client that 1 would
not see him again for some days, as he intended to make experimental trips with his
nvention right along for some time."
"People are inclined to be skeptical, general," remarked the reporter, "of the
existence of the machine and expect some statement from you definitely connecting
the lights alleged to have been seen traveling the air with the invention no.v in
your charge."
"So lar as the public is concerned," smilingly replied the attorney, "we do not
care what they think of the matter. In lact, we would rather they believed it a thing
of fancy. We are not asking the public for anything and do not propose to do so, and
therefore don t propose to take them into our confidence."
"But your reputation is more or less at stake in view of the statements published
in the newspapers and for which you have become sponsor."
"Well, all I can say on that score is that the interview with me as published in
The Call is absolutely correct in every particular, and I will add this on the authority
of a statement made to be by the inventor: He told me he actually went over Sacra
mento at the time the people there ciaimcd to have seen the airship. The inventor
has now practically decided to follow my advice to maintain as much secrecy as pos
sibie, and consequently I don't want to go into particulars about it "
"Where wai it put together? Was it not in the vicinity of Oroville?"
"That is a question I do not care to answer."
'You have stated that you are satisfied the invention is a success?"
"Yes. I have implicit confidence in it and that it is a success, because it is very
like the one I saw in 2TeÂ«r Jersty, and which I witnessed make a flight of fifteen or
twenty roils."
"Did Dr. E. H. Beniainm assist in the construction of the macbine?"
â¢I don't know Dr. Benjeniin, and don't know whether he did or not "
. "From what do you derive your confidence in the airship; irom having seen it in
actual operation, from a view of it at rest or simply from having seen the plans?"
"I have seen the plans. I have no doubt that when the machine is completed it
wiu be a success. *
"What do you mean by being completed?"
"When it is completed for the purpose for which it is now intended to utilize it
for war purposss. It would drown everybody in it if it were to fall over a body of
water as it is now built." J
"What are the other weak points that the inventor is trvitie to perfect by thp*Â«
trial flights?" * * Cl Dy lftese
"From what I understand it has to be able to carry power enough to maintain
itself bl the air for a certain number of consecutive hours, say about six. It can now
maintain itself for six hours, but not against the wind. To sail against the wind or
at angles to it more power is required than to go with it. Then itlands tou quickly
There is no provision for maintaining it in the air when the power gives out."
"Is it not possible that people frequently take the planets, such as Venus Mars
and Jupiter, which now appear very clearly in the sky. for the airship?"
"In all probability. Ttie airship sometimes displays one light and sometimes
three. These lights are under control and can be used as desired by the person man
aging the airship. I have no doubt that you will have ample and unmistakable evi
dence of tie existence of the invention in a few day?. The machine will be made
plain to the public, though my advice is to keep the details of its construction secret."
How this evidence was to be presented the general did^not say, but allowed it to
be understood that the machine would be brought so close to the earth's surface that
i.ts shape would be plainly distinguishable, as well as the lights that are now seen.
Picking up some telegram*, General Hart called attention to the widespread nnd
deep interest the reports of the flights of the aerial wonder have created. "Here are
telegrams from two New York papers," he said, "asking me to confirm the reports
telegraphed East about the invention. One of them asks for 500 words, but all I ehall
say in answer is that I believe the airship will be a success and that the inventor in
sists on secrecy, and has nothing more to say at present."
The San Francisco Call
SAN FRANCISCO, THURSDAY MORNING, NOVEMBER 26, 1896.
ALL SACRAMENTO AGAPE.
Thousands Conf dent the Airship
Mystery Made Another Visit.
SACRAMENTO, Cal.. Nov. 25.â Again
the mysterious serial visitant made its
appearance over this city this evenine,
and within a few brief moments the entire
city was in an uproar of excitement.
The floating searchlight was plainly
visible to all the gazing thousands, and
it so timed its arrival as to appear at the
same time that Venn*, the brilliant even
ing star, was illuminating the heaven?.
The onlookers found that a marked differ
ence existed between Venus and her
strange aerial competitor. This difference
consisted not only in the marked color of
the lights, but also in the size of the two
iigats. Large and brilliant as is Venus,
queen of the heavens, the light shown by
the mysterious aerial visitant proved to
be fully three times as large.
When the searchlight of the winged
visitor first appeared it was seen moving
rapidly from the northeast and heading
in a southwesterly direction. As it neared
the southern boundary of the city it
turned directly toward the west and after
passing the city went south, being dis
tinctly visible for upward of twenty min
utes. It moved with far more rapidity
than it had been seen to do in its two
former visits, and this would be accounted
for in case it be a veritable airship by the
fact of the calmness of the atmosphere,
there being not a breath of wind moving
at the time of its first appearance.
Later in the evening it again ap
proached the city from the west, having
evidently made a circle, and passed away
to the north and east, tnus completing
the circuit of the city and allowing nearly
all the residents a perfect view of the
mysterious visitant. There were many,
however, who failed to leave their houses
in time to catch a glimpse of the swiftly
moving light and who, when they did
reach the open and gazed up into the
ethereal vault, saw nothing but Venus;
but the vast majority raw both â Venus
and the moving searchlight.
Among ti.e numerous groups gazing
skyward this evening was one composed
mainly of State officials and prominent
lawyers of the city, and their expressions
of amazement and, in cases, intense
chagrin were very plainly expressed,
often in vigorous though perhaps nut
eloquent or refined Saxon.
Hon. E. D. McCabe, secretary to Gov
ernor Budd, was one of this group, and as
it was the first time he had witnessed the
mysterious light he was correspondingly
UNCLE SAM â If you will excuse me, gentlemen, I will help Major McKinley first*
EX-ATTORNEY-GENERAL W. H. H. HART.
astonished. During the past week he has
been inclined to laugh at the theory that
aerial navigation had been accomplished,
and in speaking of the subject after the
disappearance of the visitant he said:
"I am simply astonished, and will not
attempt to give any explanation cf this
mystery. The light is certainly produced
by electricity or magnesia, and can by no
possibility be a star or a meteor. Again,
there were seconds when it flickered and
disappeared entirely from view, exactly as
I have time after time observed ordinary
arc lights to do when the current was in
terrupted.
"In my judgment it certainly resembled
an extra large arc light, and it moved so
rapidly that I was obliged to repeatedly
step back several fÂ«ot in order to keep it
in view over the intercepting buildings.
I am not prepared to say it is an airship,
although it certainly looked as though
attached to a b.-dy of some kind. I can
only say that I am thoroughly convinced
that it :s a mystery and in my judgment
neither a star nor a fake."
District Attorney Frank D. Ryan viewed
the visitor for the first time. After ex
pressing his astonishment he muttered:
"And thero will be strange sights seen in
the heavens. Wars and rumors of wars.
I shall certainly attend church to-morrow,
for this may be the advent of the millen
nium." Then laughing he said :
"That thing is too deep for me. I don't
understand it. It mipht be that aerial
travel has been accomplished. It seems as
strange and improbable as were the inven
tions of the telephone, phonograph and
electric power as applied to streetcars."
George A. McCalvy, Deputy Secretary
of State, said: "I confess I am simply
amazed, for ever since the first appear
ance of the reputed airship 1 have been a
most pronounced skeptic. Attorney Col
lins of San Francisco is aft intimate friend
of mine, and I must confess tbat I have
experienced considerable amusement by
interviewing him by 'phone since
bis reported connection with the
air vessel. In the language of the
day, 'I have done many tilings to Attor
ney Collins,' but you may put me on
record as eaying that I am now fully con
vinced that there is more truth than
poetry in tne old adage 'that he laughs
best who laughs last.' This light is cer
tainly no fnke ana I am almost tempted
to believe that the problem of aerial travel
is solved."
J. A. Donlon, Assessor of Ventura
County, was one of the onlookers. It re
quired considerable persuasion to inauce
him to cross the street to catch a glimpse
of the mysterious visitant, but the look of
incredulity quickly left his facj and he
said: "Tnis simply passes my under
standine. That is certainly no star, and
I won't attempt to offer any explanation."
Professor Dodge of Gait, who is in at
tendance on the Teachers' Institute, now
in session, saw tne light and declared that
he could distinguish the outlines of a dark
body connected with it, but so indistinctly
as to be unable io give any idea of its
shape.
Judge W. A. Henry was also an inter
ested spectator, and also proclaims it not
a fake, but a reality.
Charles T. Jones, the attorney, was a
spectator, but firmly declined to give any
opinion as to what the light was, except
to say that he thought it was neither a
stAr, a meteor nor a fake.
W. R, Stone of the Secretary of State's
office was also deeply interested in the
moving mystery. He said:
"It looks like an arc light and moves as
| though attached to some kind of a vessel,
! and is certainly neither a lantarn attached
| to a kite nor any other kind of a fake that
I can imagine. I must confess that I am
stumped to find an explanation of the
mystery other than that it may be an air
| vessel.''
Such were the expressions of but a few
of some of the leading men of note in this
city, and thero were hundreds who stood
in close proximity to these few and who
uttered similar sentiments.
Lieutenant Fred Martin, commander of
the Signal Corps, who was an onlooker,
said:
"It simply passes all explanation, and I
am fully convinced this is no fake. This
afternoon two gentlemen, Messrs. Haines
and Fleehart, came into my office about
4 o'clock and told me that they had just
scon the airship moving over the city in
a northeasterly direction. They described
it as a dark, misty object, traveling
at an enormous height, yet visible acainst
the ciear blue of the ether. I did not pay
very much attention to their story at the
time, as I was inclined to think they might
have seen a cloud, but they were evidently
much in earnest in their deliberations and
said that no clouds were visible and that
the dark object moved with jjreat rapid
ity. Now that I have seen this mysteri
ons light coming from the Â«ame direction
iii which they saw it going, I am rather
inclined to believe that they have been
eye-witnesses of some mysterious air ves
sel."
DR. BENJAMIN DISAPPEARS
The Friend of the Inventor Changes
His Place of Residence.
Dr. E. H. Benjamin, formerly of 633 Ellis
street, who is reputed to have considerable
knowledge of the airship, has apparently
aisappeared, and as mysteriously as the
'_'ht that so many thousands have seen
the heavens.
For two years past Dr. Benjamin had
rented the front room of this lodging
house from E. H. Keiser, but yesterday
the furniture, cariets and household fix
tures were disposed of under the auc
tioneer's hammer. Where Air. Keiser and
his tenants have gone wa3 not stated, nor
was there a reason given except one given
in the spirit of fun by a pretty brunette,
who said:
"We have had to move for our self-pro
tection. You see, since that airship story
has been afloat, the representatives of the
press have been calling here at all times of
the day and night to see and interview
Dr. Benjamin. Why, some of them have
camped upon the front steps until 4
o'clock in the morning, and if they had
not been personally known to the police
no doubt the officers would have sus
pected that there was trouble in the
hous". Our house has become an object
of curiosity to every one who passes, and
dozens have stopped and looted up to the
windows as though they expected to see
the windows open and an airship or two
fly ont, and all because tne name of Dr.
Benjamin has been connected with the
airship story."
"Where is Dr. Benjamin to-day?" was
asked of the lady, but before she could
answer the glib- tongued auctioneer
chipped in and said: "He has gone to get
his airship ana take this lady to Europe,
where he will marry her."
After the parties had joked to their cwn
apparent satisfaction they gave this in
formation. Dr. Benjamin left the house
early in the morning â about 8 o'clock as
near as they could judge. He said that
he would be back at noon, but he failed to
return.
Before leaving he packed up all his ef
fects in trunks, which the auctioneer and
his assistar.es moved into a back room
there to wait until the owner should re
turn. Those who moved his effects found
in his room some refuse copper which fur
nished food for comment for a long time.
Thesa consisted of a lot of copper
cups about the size of ferules for small
canes. As these to some extent resem
bled percussion caps, such as are used on
the end of blasting fuse, it was suggested
that the little cups were a part of the ma
terial to be used, as Attorney Hart sug
gested, for the destruction of Havana.
The romance of these little pieces of
brass was shattered, however, when it was
learned that Dr. Benjamin has been ex
perimenting upon continuous bridge
work for teeth and these little cups wore
the crowns for rows of artificial grinders.
Many of these cups were taken away by
the anctioneer's assistants for souvenirs,
but upon being told that they were only
unfinished store teeth the men tossed
tueir copper cups into the street iv dis
Â»gust
Dr. Benjamin did not return during the
afternoon or evening and although in the
evening a dim ii^ht was to be seen in one
of the rooms no response was made to a
call at the door. In truth the door bell
was fastened on the inside. Thus Dr.
Benjamin aisappeared. Whether his
effects have been removed or not is a mat
ter of conjecture.
In connection with the movements of
Dr. Benjamin there is one incident that
apparently connects him with the in
ventor of the airship. It will be remem
bered that several people who claim to
know much about the new ship of the
skies have stated that it was built near
Oroville and that its first flight was taken
therefrom on the night that the lights
were seen in Sacramento. Also that the
inventor and owner is or was a wealthy
resident of Oroville. The latter statement
was made by Attorney Collins at the time
when ex- Attorney-General Hart said that
he talked too much. On that occasion Mr.
Collins stated that the inventor was
brought to him by a client. In the same
interview he acknowledged that Dr. Ben
jamin waa his client. Subsequently he
said that Dr. Benjamin has wealthy rela
tives in or near Oroville.
It was learned last evening that a few
days before the appearance of the air
ship's lights over the Sacramento Valley
Dr. Benjamin went to Oroville to see his
relations.
His visit at that particular time has
given rise to some speculation in the
mind of Dr. Joseph D. Hodgen, secretary
of the State Board of Dental Examiners,
of 1005 Sutter street. Last evening Dr.
Hodgen said:
"I have known Dr. Benjamin for some
time. He comes from Maine, I believe.
He is not a reiruiar practicing dentist, but
he gives much of his time to experiments
in dental work. Of late he has been at
work upon continuous plate bridge work
in artificial teeth, an idea he got from a
dentist irom Oregon.
"Abouc two week? ago I met him with
his gripsack in his hand on the street,
and he told me that he was going to Oro
viile or Auburn for a week. I am sure,
come to think t of it, that it was Oroville
and not Auburn. He said that he was
going to see his aunt. I have not seen
him since. The aay I saw him was either
on the 17tl> or the 12th inst. boon after
that I saw the first accounts of the ail
ship oTer the Sacramento Valley."
NEW CONVERTS.
Dr. Paulln No Longer a Skeptic on
the Airship Proposition.
That each day is witnessing the conver
sion of many skeptics to tne belief that
the airship is a verity is shown by the
willingness of these doubting individuals
to become witnesses to their new faith.
Last night Dr. Paulin of 1757 Nineteenth
street, East Oakland, took the trouble to
telephone his interesting experience to
The Call. He said :
"I never had any faith in the airship
until to-night. About 8 o'clock Judge
Horsburgh, a neighbor, called to us and
told us we could see the airship. We

looked out ana saw above us what ap
peared to be a group of four or five
lights and above them was outlined some
thing whicn had the form of a whale. It
was moving toward the City. Then it
changed its course toward Sausalito, and
swerved again toward the City and soon
went out of sight."
A night watchman at North Berkeley
( says that he saw the light Tuesday night
j distinctly, and watched it while it trav
j eled from San Pablo ana crossed over un
| til it was back of the high hills of Berke
| ley. This may give some indefinite sort
j of a clew concerning the place where the
. alleged airship may be, in hiding during
; the day, bo this man thought.
A noticeable fact connected with the
I mystery of the alleged airship is that the
light which is observed is seen to be trav
eling against the wind as ofton as with it.
This would not be the case if the light
were carried by a balloon or kite, as a
matter of course.
PRACTICAL JOKERS.
Lighted Balloons Sent Up in Vari-
ous Parts of the City.
Toy balloons were sent soaring upward
with hot air for a motor from several
places along Market street last night. The
wind was brisk, and when once the bal
loons were above the roofs they traveled
along steadily and naturally attracted
some attention.
Soon, however, the fuel which gave them
motion consumed the balloon. There was
no one who was stupid enough to believe
for a moment that any such proposition as
that had been sufficient at any time to de
ceive the many who have ascribed to the
mysterious airship the posession of a large
electric light. Those who sent up the fire
balloons on Market street last night soon
tired, observing that little interest was
taken in them.
Several persons with apparently an idea
i of having a little fun at the expense of the
1 public went to the top of Nob Hill last
evening about 9:30 o'clock and sent up a
hot-air balloon with a Japanese lantern
; attached to the bottom.
Instead of mounting rapidly to a great
height the thing wabbled around and
floated off en the wind over Kearny street
toward the bay. For half a mile it scarcely
rose 300 feet, and its construction and
shape were plainly seen. The people on
Kearny street jeered at the fake article
floated over them, and several suggested
that Mr. McEvoy of the American De
tective Agency had changed his place of
operation from Inspiration Point, near
Piedmont, to Nob Hill, San Francisco.
A local fireworks company reported
to-day that they had been doing a big
balloon business within the last few days..
In fact they have sold more of this kind
of fireworks within a week than they have
since ihe Fourth of July. Purchases have
been made by people from Alameda, Hay
wards, Fruitvale, Oakland, Berkeley and
San Francisco.
AGAINST FAKERS.
A Vigilance Committee Formed in
the Mission District.
Public interest in the airship is growing
every day and with witless practical jokers
people have no patience.
The prevalence of small hot-air balloons,
| carrying dingy lights across the darkened
I heavens, imposing on the credulity of per-
I sons looking for an aerial wanderer, has
j led to the forming of a vigilance commit
j tee. The committee is at present
composed of but four membersâ James
Peoples, Ed Perley, Gus Ske!!y and
N. L. Peoples, and is known as the Mis
sion Dolores Vigilance Committee. Al
though the organization has but few mem
bers each member is capable of making it
thoroughly interesting forany man caught
i in the act of releasing a miniature gas
j bag. The most enthusiastic member ia
James Peoples, the captain, who measures
j about six feet four inches and is built in
I proportion. He is looking for and is
anxious to meet a practical joker with a
balloon under his arm. Then the trouble
would commence.
"We take an occasional trip to Twin
j Peaks in search of balloon men," said Mr.
Peoples, last evening, "but as yet we have
not captured one.
'If we do find one all four of us (we
measure all together something like
twenty-four feet six inches) will jump ail2
over him for his idiotic acts, and it is safe
to say that he will reform."
ATTRACTIVE VENUS.
Her Charms Stm Beguiling Many
of the Uninitiated.
AUBURN, Cal., Nov. 25.â People here
have been inclined to discredit the exist
ence of the aerial traveler of the heavens,
but last night found several reliable citi
zens who enn swear that they saw the
light in the sky.
John T. Walsh, hospital steward, no
ticed a lig'u in the western sky just about
over Sacramento, forty miles distant. He
called his wife and she and several of the
hospital patients vouchsafe tie story as
true. Their description is that it was a
round li^ht of yellowish hue, nearly as
large as the sun. It dipped and curved for
a while and then disappeared. Dave
Chamberlain noticed a light In the heav
ens when going to supper shortly after 6
o'clock, and when he reached home called
his father's and mother's attention to it.
Deputy Recorder Henry Hart is anotner
who saw it.
FRESNO, Cal., Nov. 24.â The airship
passed over Fresno at 6 o'clock this even
ing. Only the light could be seen. Some
say it was Venus setting. The light passed
over the city in a northwesterly direction.
INQUISITIVE RIVALS.
Searchlights Seeking for the War-
ship of the Air.
VALLEJO, Cal., Nov. 25.â The search
lights on the monitors Monadnock and
Monterey are Hashing throughout the
heavens this eveniug. in hopes of discov
ering the whereabouts of the great air
ship. Up to 8 o'clock no discoveries have
been mads and it is expected by the offi
cers at tne yard that some other course
will be pursued by the air voyagers for
fear that big Betsy and Alice on the Mon
terey will be trained on and fired at the
warship of the air.
A BALLOONING FATALITY.
Thrilling Story ag Related by a Sur
vivor.
The Vossische Zeit-ung publishes an
account of the wreck of the balloon Jupiter
from the mouth of M. Boiteux, one
of the aeronauts, who says: "When
we had risen 500 yards or more
we found ourselves in such thick
clouds that we could distinguish nothing.
Suddenly the Jupiter lay off on one side
and the car leaped terribly. At the same
time we were lashed by large hailstones
ana heavy run. We we're -driven forward
with bewildering speed. In our fright we
threw out everything that our bauds came
across.
The balloon sprang upward like an ar
row ami soon passpd through the clouds.
We were under a clear sky, in the light of
the setting sun. Gradually it grew colder
and colder, and our wet clothes were
frozen stiff. Crepillon fell faintine to the
bottom of the boat, and we others were
not much better off. We were all bleed
ing, for the hail had bounded us. As I
looked out I saw a large black cloud mov
ine from southwest to northeust. But we
still rose. Then I saw nothing more. The
blood streamed from my nose and ears.
My hands were frozen hard as a ooard.
In a few minutes we had risen to a height
of nearly 5000 yard?. Then we began to
sink, at tirst slowly, then rapidly. All at
once we were again in complete darkness.
We weie in the midst of thunder
clouds. Again, amid hail and ram, the
wind drove the Jupiter on at a speed of
ninety miles an hour. We were blinded
by the hail, and could scarcely breathe.
But I did not lose hope of reaching the
earth safely. The hail and rain, now
began to be mixed with leaves and par
ticles of earth. The car was violently
shaken, and we fell against each other
and had to hold on to the ropes.
Then we began to drag along the ground.
The balioon suddenly rose again. I let
my rope go and was dashed to ihe ground.
Legrantt believed that I had voluntarily
jumpert out. He jumped after me and fell
near me with a broken leg. Thus lightened
of weight the balloon rose more Rapidly.
Rushing through the tree tops it went on
about six miles in the direction of Gretz.
As it hung on the top of a tree Foucard
tried to land, caught a rope, but was
thrown violently to the cart.i. A woman
saw tiie balloon ranging in the trees and
sent the people at her inn to our assist
ance.
Foucard was found covered with mud
and ice, his face all torn. He still
breathed. When his head was raised with
the intention of giving him stimulants he
was seized with a convulsion and soon ex
pired. As he was carried away a weak
voice was heard calling from the car for
help. Two ladders were brought and tied
together and a gendarme climbed up to
assist Crepillon. It took an hour to get
him down. On reaching the ground he
fainted away. He was cold as ice and
only regained hs senses after continued
friction.â Westminster Gazette.
AN HISTORIC CANNON.
It Fired the Last Shot In the Last Bat-
tle of the Rebellion.
The cannon which tired the iast shot in
the last battle of the late war is a cun
worth knowing something about. Hence,
the sale of the eight-inch Columbian,
"Lady Slocomb," which is advertised in
the Mobile Register to take place there on
the 15th, arouses the interest of old sol
diers and old soldiers' son-;, for the reason
that it is Reneraliy supposed to be the gun
which fired the last shots of the war, or
that tired so many deadly volleys in the
last battle that took place during the Civil
War.
This last engagement, said an old sol
dier yesterday, took place at Spanish
Fort. This engagement, of course, was
not a regular tmtle and is not, perhaps,
recorded in history as such, but it was,
nevertheless, a conflict fierce, and fire
flew that day as never before. General
Forrest had sent to Spanish Fort during
the last days of the war a sufficient force
of men to guard the place, and among
the number was the Fifth Battalion of
the Washington Artillery, Captain Cuth
bert Slocomb in command. The Lady
Slocomb was brought there, and there
fired Us last shots when Wilson's raiders
stormed the place and took it. There the
Lady Slocomb, for a few hours before the
old fort was surrendered, belched forth
fire and scattered death like an intelligent
being, but to no avail, as the enemy num
bered several times as much as the garri
son.
After the surrender of the fort some of
the members of Captain Slocomb's com
mand one night rolled the Lady Slocomb
off the earthen embankment into a lauoon
or old slush hole and buried it, giving as
their reason that they did not want the
gun to fall into the hands of the enemy.
It was afterward dug up and carried to
Mobile, where it was purchased by Henry
Badger, a prominent Confederate of that
place, who had served through the war
and knew of the excellence of the Lady
Slocomb.
The gun was named after the wife of
Captain Cuthbert Siocomb, who went out
in 1862 in charge of the Fifth Battalion of
the Washington Artillery. Tne gun at
the battle of Shilob spat out its first
sraoke and spread its first desolation in
the ranks of the enemy. Through all the
memorable struggles of the Army of the
Tennessee it went out and every where it
gained well - d-rserved renown. It was
prettily mounted, and was at that time,
as it probably is now, a handsome gun.
Now the old relic is to be sold. The es
tate of Henry Badger is being wound ud,
and the gun. along with other relics of the
Confederacy, is to fall into the hands of
others. "Years ago several efforts were
made by the Washington Artillery to buy
the gun, and they will in all probability
be heard from at the sale.â New Orleans

CABINET-MAKERS
VISIT McKINLEY
Farmers Name a Man for
Secretary of Agri
culture.
Michigan Would Feel Honored
if General Alger Were
Recognized.
Whitelaw Reid, Mark Hanna and
Oiher Prominent Persons Dine
With the Major.
CANTON, Ohio, Nov. 25.â Major Mc-
Kinley listened this evening to a formal
request for recognition by appointment to
the Cabinet A com mittee of the National
Grange, an organization of farmers with a
membership of 250,000. urged Mr. McKin
ley to appoint J. H. Brigiiam of Ohio as
Secretary of Agriculture. The committee
consisted of G. H. Hale of New York,
George B. Horton of Michigan and W. W.
Miller, secretary of the Ohio State of Agri
culture. Aaron Jones, the spokesman,
said:
"Wo feel that the vast agricultural in
terest of the country ought to be recog
nized by the appointment of a practical
farmer to the position of Secretary of Ag
riculture. Colonel Brigham, whom we
recommend, is a successful farmer, a
strong man of affairs, a good writer and a
good Republican. He has been for tome
years chairman cf the National Grange,
and he is favorably and widely known.
We are not satisfied with the course of
the present administration toward the
farmers. We hope the Republican party
will give us not only a representativs in
Cabinet, but fair and generous treatment
in i's tariff bill."
Major McKinley promised to carefully
consider tlie suggestions of the committee
and its members departed in excellent
spirits.
The most interesting feature of the Pres
ident-elect's day was the arrival of a party
of distincuished visitors from Cleveland at
1:30. In tho party were Mr. and Mrs. M. A.
Hanna and Miss Mabel Hanna, General
and Mrs. Samuel Thomas of New York
and their son, ex-Governor Merriam of
Minnesota, Mrs. Merriam and Miss
Merriam, Miss Phelps, General W. D.
Caldwell, president of the Lake Shore
Railroad, and Mrs. Caldwell, Mr. and Mrs.
H. A. Gauslin, of Toledo. Mr. and Mrs.
Whitelaw Reid, who were journeying to
Arizona, arrived at the same time. Major
McKmley and his brother Abner were at
the station to receive the guests. Major
McKinley escorted Mrs. Whitelaw Re:d
and Mrs. Hanua to his carriage and drove
them himself to the house. Mark Hanna
sat on the seat beside him.
Luncheon was served at 2 o'clock;. It
was 3:30 when the party left the table.
Major McKinley withdrew for a private
talk with Mr. Reid, and remained closet
ed with him until the visitors left for the
station at 4p. m. There was a good deal of
talk about ex-Governor Merriam of Min
nesota for becretary of the Interior. Mr.
Hanna did not have a private conference
with Major McKinley, owing to the brev
ity of his visit.
Congressman Smith of Grand Rapids,
Mich., the only man in the State who ran
ahead of Governor-elect Fineree. came by
appointment to see Mr. McKiniey late this
afternoon. He was accompanied hf
Charles M. Head. Mr. Smith was cor
dially greeted by the President-elect and
had a long audience with him.
"Michigan would ieel honored," said
Mr. Sruiih to a representative of the United
Associated Presses, "if General Alger
were given a Cabinet position. We feel
that we deserve good treatment from the
Republican party."
Continuing, Mr. Smith said: "I am
opposed to the Dingley bill and do not
think it will pass. The indications are
that there will be an extra session of Con
gress."
Among the callers to-day were Murat
Halstead, A. Butler Duncan of New York
and E. F. Andrews, director of the Cor
coran School of Art, Washington.
VOORHEES IN THE SENATE.
A Son of the Tall Sycamore of the
Wabash May Wear the Mantle
of His Father.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 25.â C. H.
Hagen of Seattle, Wash., who is at the
Norrnandie Hotel, says there is a possi
bility that the name of Voorhees will still
appear on the Senate roll after tne 4th of
next March, although the Bycamore of
the Wabash is to retire. He reports that
there is a very strong sentiment in Wash
ington State in favor of electing Charles
8. Voorhees, a son of Daniel W. , to the
Senate, to succeed Watson C. Squire. It
will be remembered that Charley Voor
hees, as a dele. ate to Congress, was in
strumental in securing the admisson of
Washington Territory as a State. It was
generally understood at that time that
he would have been chosen Senator had
the first State Legislature been Demo
cratic. The Democrats and Populists
have a large majority in the Washington
Legislature, which meets next January,
and Mr. Voorhees' chances are said to be
good.
GOLD CERTIFICATES.
Movements of the Treasury Department
Indicative of a Renewal of Their
Issuance.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Not. 25.âAssist
ant Secretary Curtis has been in New York
two days, but will be at his desk again
Friday. No information is vouchsafed at
the department as to the cause for his
visit to New York, but it is believed to be
on account of the proposed renewal of the
issuance of gold certificates. It was gen
erally understood at the department that
upon the return of the Assistant Secre
tary, Secretary Carlisle would issue an
order permitting the resumption of this
practice, he having authority under the
act of July 12, 1882, to stop the issue of
gold certificates whenever the reserve Ml
below the $J00.000,000 mark. The cessation
of this issue has happened frequently
during the past four years, but it is now
believed that the ordinary course of busi
ness will not interfere with a practice that
has been found convenint for the banking
institut.ons of the country, and particu
larly for those in the large cities.
There has been no stable gold balance
since 1893. When Secretary Carlisle took
hold of i he treasury in March, 1893. there
was $116,000,000 of gold certificates, out
standing, but they have Leen entirely
withdrawn. When the first suspension of
the issue of gold certificates occurred
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 26, 1896.
ther* was $1 14,000,000 outstanding. This
happened in April, 1893. After the sale of
bonds the gold reserve was recouped, but
only temporarily. On two different oc
casions the issue of gold certificates was
resumed, but it was stopped at both times
within two or three days alter the order
was made permitting them. Then the
Secretary decided not xo again direct their
issue until tlie balance was stable and de
void of the fluctuations that bad marked
it through a period of many months.
To-day the out-mnding gold cerTlticates
aggregate only 139.538,139. The issue pro
posed consists of denominations of $5000
and $10,000, and will be issu d to such
persons as deposit for the gold in the
treasury upon which they are issued.
These issues are largely used by banks as
a part of their reserve funds, and enable
them to carry a large amount of tne
equivalent of cold without the bulky
article itself, and without the attendant
losses by abrasion, etc.
THE VENEZUELAN QUESTION.
All Disputes Practically Settled, but There
Are Certain Formalities Yet to
Be Observed.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 25.âWith
out there being any direct official advices
on the matter it is very apparent that the
report of the Venezuelan Commission,
which is now virtually completed, will be
in the pohsession of the President prior to
the completion of the forthcoming mes
sage to Congress.
How the character of the commission's
report may be changed from its present
standing, in view of the friendly attitude
oi this country and England loward each
other in the settlement of Venezuela s
trouble, is a subject of some official and
diplomatic interest. That poiut appears
to await official reports from the Govern
ment of Caracas.
Should an agreement between Great
Britain and the United States prove ac
ceptable to Venezuela, the incident will be
harmoniously and finally closed in all
quarters, and not tend to a recalling
of past acrimony and recitals of
more or less national disagreement
that would appear should circumstances
call ior detailed statements of the numer
ous points involved hi the controversy as
considered by the Commissioners. In the
event of the South American republic
cordially acquiescing in the decision of
the two great powers bearing the brunt of
the dissensions a formal report only will
be necessary.
Judge Brewer of the commission was in
consultation to-day with Secretary Olney,
presumably on the subject, but he declines
io give any indication whatever of the
purposes of his visit to the State De
partment.

WEST POINT CHANGES.
The Academy* Sphere of V*rfulnea* to
Be Enlarged.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 25.-The
annual report of the Board of Visitors to
the West Point Military Academy recotn
meuus raising the requirements for ad
nmsicn so as to provide that applicants
shall be examined in such subjects as may
be prescribed from time to time by the
Secretary of War before they shall be ad
mitted to the academy. As the barrack*
and academy building were found to be
ample for tne accommodation of at least
eigbty-eieht more cadets, or two at lar.e
from each State in the Union, or one for
each Seqator, and the additional cost
would be slight, the board recommends
that an act of Congress should be passed
lor the nomination of one cadet by each
Senator in addition to those narue.l "by the
members of the House of Representatives.
The Board of Visitors recommends addi
tions and improvements at the ncademy
barracks, the extension and repairs of the
riding-ha!l and stables and a number of
other improvements, which they think
will make the military academy the most
complete school of tne kind in tne world

BILLY SMITH'S
FOUL FIGHTING
Loses His Battle With
Ryan After Nine
Rounds.
Gets Rattled in the Hot Contest
and Disregards the
Re'ere?.
Hissed Down by Disgusted Spectators
When He Appeals From the
Decision.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 25.â In the
ninth round of the twenty-round battle
between "Mysterious" Billy Smith of Bos
ton and Tommy Ryan of Syracuse, at the
Empire Athletic Club to-night, Referee
Hurst disqualified Smith for repeated
fouling and gave Ryan the decision.
There was bitter blood between the
mci:, who have already met four times.
The battle was fairly even up to the ninth
round. Though Smith did most of the
leading Ryan's wonderful defense evened
matters.
Smith opened the ninth with a terrific
left-hander, which landed on Ryan's left
eye, cutting it open.
Smith apparently went wild at the sight
of the blood, and the fight, which had
been tame in the early rounds, began in
earnest. Smith landed right and left
punches and had Ryan hard put to it to
defend himself. Then Smith commenced
deliberately fouling his man, hitting him
in the breakaway, holding in the clinches
and elbowing.
Ryan appealed several times to the
referee. At length that official, having
several times cautioned Smith, sent the
men to their corners and declared Ryan
the winner. Smith refused to shake
hands with Tommy and for a moment it
looked as if the battle was going to be re
newed, but the seconds quieted the men.
Smith tried to address the crowd, but he
was hissed down by the disgusted spec
tators.
There were not more than 1500 people
present. Ryan was attended by Jimmy
Handler, Fred Smith, Tom Grady and
George English. . Charley White, Tim Me-
Grath and Bill Crowley were behind
Smith. â¢ They shook hands at 10:15 r. x. 'â -. ;'.'

Round They were only sparring so far.
Smith led, but was stopped. Ryan came into
mi uppercut, but got back with his right on
the body. Tommy then put his left on the

one to the belt. Ryan put his let ton the brfdy.

done all the leading so far, but Tommy
showed his usual cleverness. .

very vicious swings. In a rally Smith landed

best of the exchange. Tommy lauded ,: his left
on the face and Billy countered on the body.
Smith drove his right and left on the body,
teiore the bell rang. Smith's eyes were a bit
red.

the body and they clinched. Smith rushed in,
but Ryan clinched. Ryan put both hands on
the face liuhtly Smith drove in a couple of
rib-finders and Tommy's left found the Boston
man's face. Smith put a hard one on the ear
and two corking lefts on the body that hurt.

his pains. They were getting warmed up and
It was even so far. ... . â¢. - . -

CORNELL EXPHCIS TO SCORE.
But Ha* Faint Hopes of Defeating the
Pennsylvania**.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Nov. 25.â The
last lootball game of the season of 1896
between the big Eastern . colleges will be
played to-morrow between \ Cornell and
Pennsylvania on Franklin field/- The Cor
nell teamâ substitutes, coaches and rub
bers, in all about twenty-nine men â ar
rived here this evening from Ithaca and
are quartered at the Hotel S ten ton. That
Pennsylvania will win "' to-morrow is an
almost foregone conclusion, but \ Cornell
always plays a hard and plucky game and
as trie Ithacans are In much better condi
tion than . when they met .) Harvard ; and
Princeton, and will also have the fullest
strength of their -team out for t!ie first
time this season, good game is looked for.
While the Cornelians do; not expect to
win, they do expect to score. They are
counting on Pennsylvania's > two .-: fatal
faults of this season â a fumble and a
blocked kickâ to aid them across the goal
line of the red and blue. Aside from
either one of these two causes it is impos
sible that Cornell will score, as Pennsyl
vania's defense this year has been abso
lutely impregnable \to : every team they
have played," and the only times they have
been scored ,' upon ' has been due to a
blocked kick near the goal line/ggggEmn
Â.Besides. .Besides hoping to score, Cornell ex
pects to keep Pennsylvania's score down
to about four . touchdowns. Notwith
standing the hard - game : played against
| Harvard last Saturday, the :Pcnnsyl
vaniansare in s fine â  condition. - They ;do
not expect that Cornell will be able to
score, and they, themselves expect to wind
up at least thirty points. *V. 2 â â¢'-:

the latter has been under the weather for

PRINCETON KEATS YALE.
Football Seniton tinned HUH a Contest
ftrttctien frrithtnen.
PRINCETON, N. J., Nov. 25.â The fooi
b&ll season closed here to-day by the
Princeton freshmen defeating the Yale
freshmen by the score of 14 to 4. About
2000 spectators turned out to see the con
test, but there were few representatives
from New Haven present.
The young Tigers bad things pretty
much their own way in the first half, but
in the second half Yale showed the ad
vantage they had gained by steady prac
tice for some time past, while Princeton
was, to a great extent, a picked up eleven,
having had little opportunity of learning
i team play.
Princeton had better men in every posi-
I tion, with the exception of the center trio,
where Sutphin and Marshal made things
hot for their opponents. The only thing
that kept Yale from scoring once or twice
i was their fumbling at critical times. Their
I best gains were made by masspiay^ on the
| center and by usins: the quarterback trick
j around Oglesbv's end.
Princeton made the most ground by
i workine Yale's ends, which were quite
: weak ana by gains on Wheeler's i>unt.
i Wheeler punted well, but both elevens
i depended mainly on tactics.

Small Hope fir the Passage cf the
Dingley Tar ff Bill During the
Coming Session.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 25. -Only
a few stragglers have reached Washington
to attend the session of Congress, and
from the expressions of these Senators
and Representatives it is apparent that
no plans have yet been formed as to legis
lation to be accomplished ths winter.
Nothing can be determined until cau
cuses are held alter Congress has assem
bled. Chaos will reign in both the Demo
cratic and Republican conferences. The
bolting Republicans will have their own
little caucus, and so will the gold Demo
crats, for the latter will be g ; ven the cold
shoulder by the regular Democrats. The
regulars and Populists will also caucu?
separately.
Senators Palmer, Gray, Vilas and Caf
fery will be denied admission to the Dem
ocratic caucus, and it is believed ihat they
may vote with the Republicans on many
questions. There is some doubt about
Senators Hill and Smith, who have
not entirely forfeited tneir claims to be
regarded as Democrats.
The silver Republicans who supported
Bryan are in closer touch with the Demo
crats than are the four bolting gold Sena
tors (Palmer, Vilas, Gray and Caffery)
with the Repubicans.
The iliree silver factions intend to op
pose the Republicans on the tariff â all ex

his intention of voting with the gold men

The cnances for the passage of the
Dingley tanff bi:l ; are slender. Mr. Ding
ley himself admits the probability ttiat
the bill will fail at this session. The re
port from Canton that Mr. McKinley
does not favor the passage of any tariff
bill at this session is generally credited by j
his friends here.

HE RIGGED THE MARKET.
An Australian Broker Contra to Grief
on 'Change in London.
. NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 25.â A special
dispatch to the Sun from London says:
The most sensational case of rigging the
market for many years came to a crisis
on the London Stock Exchange to-day.
Shares in the Lady Hampton, a new
Australian mine, the actual and par value
of which is $5, reached the nominal quo
tation of $1500 each. The history of the
deal is this:
A few weeks : a?o the stock of the Lady.
Hampton Company was offered to the pub
lic .in _ the. usual way at par. Be
fore the allotment "was made a
big jobber in the Australian market
named Stoneham undertook to break the
price of the stock, which was quoted in
advance of the issue at a slight premium;
He offered the . stock ; in 1000-share
lots a little under the market. The
company's brokers bought 3000 shares
from * him. Mr. : Stonenam then en
deavored .to obtain the stock for
delivery :by subscribing in the names :of
his clerks for 3000 shares. The directors of
the company determined to punish him.
They sentlette:s of regret to all the public
subscribers and allotted ail the shares to
themselves and friends. 1 Mr. Stoneham
found it impossible to obtain the stock to
complete his bargain at any but prohibi
tive figures. It would cost him $450,000 to*
get - ; 3000 * shares at -; to-day's . quotations.
The men "â¢* who have ;so " successfully
rigged v the market' offer to compromise
with : him i for $1,000,000 cash. - Mr. Stone
ham offers $150,000. The Stock Exchange
committee hud appointed next Monday for
â  settlement, but have now jvstpoiied it in
definitely. â¢ Mr. Stoneham: has ; invoked
the law and begun , prosecution against
his .persecutors, for conspiracy. The
chances are that thr matter.will be com
promised.

FOR CUBA LIBRE
Crushing Defeat of Wey
ler's Army Near Mt.
Rubia.
Why the Spaniard Hastened
Back to His Stronghold
at Havana.
Revenged for His Defeat by the Mur
der of Pacificos and Wounded
Prisoners.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 25.â The
Ward line steamer City of Washington,
which arrived to-day from Havana,
brought some interesting news of the en
gagement which occurred near Mount
Rubia between the Spanish troops and the
insurgents, headed by Maceo.
Last Saturday the Government organ,
La Lucha, called for trains to convey 1000
wounded and sick soldiers from Candela
ria to Havana. This was the first intima
tion that had been received that the en
gagement had been serious in its results.
One of the passengers on the C:ty of
Washington, who for obviou3 reasons did
not wish to have his name mentioned,
gave an interesting account of how the
battle was fought, and this to a great ex
tent, it is thought, explains why General
Weyler returned to Havana so soon.
Mount Rubia is twenty-six miles west of
Havana anil about twelve miles from the
northern coast of the island. General
Weyler had spread his trocha across the
island in its narrowest part to prevent
Maceo's forces moving toward the east.
Then the remaining forces were divided
into three detachments, one of 5000 men,
another of 10,000 and the third of 20,000,
the latter being led by General Weyler
himself. These detachments moved to
ward the mountains from different direc
tions.
The detachment of 5000 reached the
mountains first, and after heavy fighting
was repulsed by Maceo's forces with 700
wounded and it is not known how many
dead. WLen the second detachment of
10,000 men, under command of General
Echague, arrived and began to storm the
mountain they found that the enemy had
disappeared. General Weyler, who ap
proached from the trocha, did not have a
chance to smell powder.
Details are lacking, but it appears that
Maceo bad another engagement west of
Mount Rubia, in wb*cn 1000 of the Span
ish troops were wounded. Five hundred
of the wounded were brought into Ha
vana by rail and 200 were brought by
water, leaving 1000 sick and wounded still
on the field. Weyler's failure to locate
Maceo would appear to have been the
cause of his hasty return to Havana.
William Brown, a subject of Great
Britain recently released from a Cuban
prison, where he had spent a month Jor
the alleged offense of shouting in the
streets of Havana '"Cuba libre," and who
was a week ago expelled by order of
Captain-General Weyler, said he aid not
care to go into details regarding his treat
ment by the Spanish authorities, except
to say that the treatment was brutal in
the extreme, and that if he had not had
papers proving him to be a British sub
ject he wou;d yet be in a Spanish dun
geon.
"Cuba, in my mind, is lost to Spain.
The latter country is now on her beam
ends and the storm on the little island
will soon engulf her," he said.
Mr. Brown declared that no political
prisoner in Cuba Knew what he was ar
rested for until he had been in a prison
cell for some time. While declining to
give details in his own case, be talked
freely of Spanish cruelty in other in
stances. Some of his stories are almost
incredible. He said:
"Let me tell you something of Weyler's
system. Honore Lame was captured by
General Maceo of the Cuban army, about
nine months ago. He was detained but a
few days. After his liberation Lame re
turned to his home in Havana. Later he
was arrested at the instance of a personal
friend, a particular friend of Weyler. Sev
eral months after his arrest he was tried
before a jury composed of Weyler's own
creatures and declared innocent.
"Did that make any difference? Not a
bit. He is still held a prisoner and his
ca^e has been referred to Madrid. Weyler
showed his feeling toward the court that
declared Lame innocent by sending them
into the fi- Id as a punishment. Mr. Lame
is a Frenchman and is trying to get his
case to the attention of the French Govern
ment.
"Weyler has had many foreigners ar
rested. He detests them. Most of" these
. cases have never seen the light of day,
because of the Spanish system of placing
them so that their respective Governments
never learn of their subjects' misery.
Finally they dropout of sight It saves
the cost and trouble of trial. The poor
Cuban gets short shrift.
"It is sufficient to know that he is a
sympathizer in the cause. That is hia
death-warrant If the unfortunate one
has friends his trial is a farce. His con
viction is an absolute certainty, and by
the first steamer he is sent to Chafarina or
some other penal colony.
'Here is Â« story related by a prisoner
now confined in the prison in which I was.
Colonel Moline in one of his recent raids,
while endeavoring to locate an insurgent
hospital, met a 14-year-old boyâ Curios
Hernanda. He aemanded from the youth
the location of the hospital. The boy did
not know.
"Moline struck him on the head with his
revolver, causing the blood to flow. A
repetition of ihe question, bringing the
. same reply, resulted in the boy's eye be
ing forced from its socket by a blow from
the Spanish officer's pistol. Not satisfied
with this he struck the boy again, Killing
him, and undoubtedly reported a gallant
victory to Weyler.
"This same butcher Moiine murdered a
whole family. Gonzales by name, the same
day, for refusing to inform him of the di
rection taken by the insurgents.
"These acts of murder and cruelty are
in marked contrast to the Christian spirit
shown and practiced by General Calixto
Garcia, the insurgent chief, who sent the
wounded Spanishprisoners captured from
Guiomorc to Puerto Principe.
"La Lucha in its edition of November 21
informs the people of Cuba that Colonel
Pons Devela surprised and destroyed a
rebel hospital at Campo Florida. There
were eighteen beds occupied at the time,
and as there was no mention of prisoners,
it ia understood that the sick: were killed.
"Reliable information from a party just
relumed from the Ptnar del Rio district
was a few days ago received in Havana.
It states that a reign of death and pillage
was well under way there, men, women
and children being outraged and shot
down in their homes or wherever found.
Most of them were pacificos, their
only offenses being that they did
not quickly enough bend to Wey
ler's soldier* by removing into the
towns, where they were almost sure to
starve to death, as Spain's captain-general
was known to have no facilities for hous
ing and feeding them. This has all oc
curred since Weyler took the field. It
looks as if he wished to have bountiful re
venge for having been driven from com
fortable headquarters In Havana."
Mr. Brown would not say where he
would stay while in this city. He is said
fo be saving the details of his personal ex
perienccs for publication in Europe. A
perfect knowledge of Spanish has helped
him to a fuller insight of the Cuban ques
tion than it is possible for most aliens in
Cuba to obtain.
CANOVAS' WARLIKE TALK.
This Xaiion of Shopkeeper* Must fight
if It Interfere* in Cuba.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 25.â The Sun
to-morrow will say :
In a pamphlet just published in Spanish
by the Cuban journalist, Scnor Jose de
Annas-Cardenas, the author relates two
interviews he had in Madrid, during the
month of Aupust. with the Prime Minis
ter of Spain, Senor Antonio Canovas del
Castillo.
After havinp: consulted Senor Estrada
Palma, the Cuban delegate in the United
! States, and knowing the opinion of
j General Gomez, Senor Annas tried
to learn also what Senor Cano
vas would think about a peaceful
i arrangement of the Cuban question in the
! form of a contract between the belligerents
I in which Spain should grant independence
j to Cuba and the Cuban republic agree to
j pay a war indemnity to Spain.
Last May, and through an important
j Spanish official, the Count of Casa Mi
| randa, Senor Annas, while in Paris re
i ceived word that the Prime Minister of
I Spain was ready to hear him on the sub
ject provided Senor Annas could guaran
tee that in case the Spanish Government
coultj make such a proposal the Cubans in
I arms would accept it.
Senor Annas had then another interview
i with Senor Palma, and the latter offered
i to transmit the proposal to the Cuban
Government and give his personal opinion
in favor of it as well as his guarantee that
the Cubans in arms would be will
ing to make such an agreement, but
knowing the Spanish pride he told
Senor Annas not to act as a representative
of the Cuban revolutionists, because the
Spanish Government would believe that
they were looking for peace and had
found themselves too feeble to continue
the war. That Mr. Palma was right is
proved in the pamphlet referred to in this
article.
Returning to Paris in Aueust, Senor
Annas waj escorted to Madrid by an offi
cial specially sent for that purpose by
Senor Canovas and under an assumed
name with a Spanish passport. Ir. Madrid
Senor Canovas received Senor Annas, and
the first prouosal ha made was to grant
: home rule to the island of Cuba.
As Senor Annas answered that such a
thing was out of the question, the Prime
Minister offered to grant independence
after the Cubans had laid down their arms
"to satisfy the national pride."
Senor Annas replied that in his position,
acting independently for the accomplish
ment of a practical end, he could not
transmit such a proposal, as the Cubans
would never believe a promise of that
kind made by bpain.
Here the Prime Minister grew angry,
and with insulting expressions about Cuba
obliged Senor Annas to make an answer
which put him in danger of immediate
| arrest. The affair would have ended there,
but next day when Senor Annas was about
to leave Madrid the Prime Minister called
I him again to his office and tried
I to convince him of the wisdom of trans
| mining his plan to the Cubans, but as
j Senor Annas refused to do it without a
| guarantee from ihe Government of the
I United States that Spain would keep her
i promise, the Prime Minister said:
"The United States? Never, never! A
nation of shopkeepers to guarantee the
word of Spain? The United States are
alone responsible for what happens in
Cuba. They are the true authors of the
war, and I assure you if Spain loses Cuba
the United States will pay to Spain what
Cuba is worth.
"The Mora claims begin to cost them
dear. The claims of Spain are now a hun
dred times n;ore. The United States
threatens Europe with the Monroe doc
trine and Spain, in the name of Europe,
will accept the challenge.
"Don't talk to me about the United
States. If they like to inierfere Spain will
fight, and if they like to take down the
Spanish flag m Cuba they can only obtain
it after a glorious Trafalgar in front of
Havana."
CO NDEMNER TO HEATH.
fate of a Cuban Who Was Promised
Amnesty.
HAVANA, Cvba, Nov. 2-5. â Antonio
Lopez Coioma, who was at the head of the
revolution in the province of Matanzas
whrÂ»n the present insurrection in Cuba
broke out, has been condemned to deti'h
for the crimes of rebell.on and homicide.
He is to be executed to-morrow in the
Cabanas fortress. Coioma, who headed
the insurgents in the Matanzas province,
where the insurrection was suppressed
after about six weeks' fighting through
the activity of the Spanish authorities,
surrendered, together with many others
of the rebel?, upon the strength of a
proclamation of amnesty made by Cap
tain-General Calleja. In the ea>M of
nearly all the others who gave themselves
up the captain-general's promise wat made
good and they were set at liberty. Coio
ma, however, in spite of the promise of
amnesty made to him. was not released,
he being looked upon as one of the leaders
and organizers of the rebellion. Instead,
he was sent to Morro Cattle, where he has
been confined for over a year and a half
awaiting a decision in his case. The
authorities made no attempt to Inflict
upon him any more severe punishment
than imprisonment.

CONGRATULATE SALISBURY.
England's Untenable Claims in the
Veneruelan Boundary Di*p*tt-e.
LONDON. Exo , Nov. 25.â Sir Edward
Clarke, M. P., formerly So citor-General,
speaking at Accrington lust night, con
gratulated Lord Salisbury upon having
the courage to abandon the preposterous
claims that Great Britain had made for
years regarding the boundary between
British Guiana and Venezuela.
Referring to the proposed arbitration
treaty Sir Edward said he did not believe
that a permanent arbitration tribunal
would be likely to lessen tne number of
difficulties between Great Britain and the
United States. Diplomacy was capable of
dealing with most questions without re
ferring them to a clumsy and unsatisfac
tory court of arbitration.
Sir Edward, it will be remembered,
caused much adverse comment some time
aero by declaring publicly that Great Brit
ain's claims regarding Venezuela were
untenable.

LONG AND SHORT HAULS.
Western Railroads Granted a Hearing
Before the Interstate Commerce
Commission.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Nov. 25.â 1n
accordance with petitions of the Southern
Pacific. Denver and Rio Grande, Denver
and Rio Grande Western, the Santa Fe
and Colorado Midland, the Interstate
Commerce Commission to-day ordered
that on December 18 there be a hearing
granted these loads, which have asked
that section 4 of interstate commerce act
be set aside in order that "they may be
authorized in the transportation of like
kinds of pronerty to charge less compen
sation In tne aggregate for the long dis
tances from common points in Colorado
and terminal points in California than for
snorter distances over the same lines in
the same direction, the shorter distance
being included within the longer."
They represent that sharp competition
by water from Atlantic ports to the
Pacific Coast make it imperative that they
should be allowed this through rate. The
Interstate Commerce Commission also
orders that at the hearing these companies
shall file their present schedules of local

they desire to make.
SEALS ON SEKING NEA.
Dr. Darid Starr -I â  ,<t .,â><, Interesting
J-ee-ure at Washington.
WASHINGTON, D. C. Nov. 25.-Pro
fessor David Starr Jordan, president of
Stanford University, delivered an inter
esting lecture last night on the "Seals of
Bering Sea." A number of stereopticon
views of photographs taken on the islands
were shown on screen. While noi refer
ring to his official conclusions it was quite
evident the speaker thought sometning
should be done to protect seal pups and
check the loss of life. among the pups
which is due to the fiehting of the bulls!
He also referred to the habits of the ani
mals, which resulted in their going for
food 200 miles from the islands, and con
trasted this distance with the limit of
ownership extending from land fixed by
international agreement. He had also
something to say of pelngic sealing, and
stated that every female soal liiiled meant
the destruction of two lives. He said the
animal killing of bachelor seals was of
benefit, as their presence near the rook
eries led to increased fighting among the
bulls.
THE TEXAS DIDLY DAMAGED.
Extensive Repairs Aece*sary Before She

WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 25.-While
the -naval court which investigated' the
recent foundering of the battle-ship Texas
has not yet returned a ' verdict, it *is
learned that' without extensive repairs it
is very doubtful whether the Texas can
be 'again ordered to sea. It is understood
that sixty-one of her compartments leaked
when tier engine-room was flooded and
that a leak sprung in any one of them at
*ea might cause the total loss of the ship.
Not only were all the alleged "water
tight" doors found defective, but in the
opinion of a : member of ; the court her
whole bulkhead system is utterly' useless.

R'joices That No Man Can Hold Office
in This Land Unless the People
Want Him.
PUEBLO. Colo., Nov. 25.â Mr. Bryan
boarded his train a few minutes after 3
o'clock this morning at Denver, where he
went to sleep in a Pullman car. The train
pulled out from Denver at 7 o'clock. The
first stop was at Burnham, where a large
crowd had assembled. There were calls
for a speech, but when told that Mr. Bryan
was asleep the crowd preserved silence.
At Littleton the same programme was
repeated, with the exception that Gov
ernor-elect Adams addressed a few words
to the crowd, and then the train left for its
long climb up the hill that separates the
waters of the Arkansas from the Platte.
The pace was terrific, the train swinging
around the long curves at a lively gate,
and when the engine halted at Palmer
Lake, on the apex of the watershed, Mr.
Bryan stepped off tiie train to get a cup of
coffee and landed in the midst of the
howling crowd, to which he smiled and
addressed a few words.
The next stop was at Colorado Springs,
"Little Lunnun,"' as it is dubbed, where a
large crowd cheered itself hoarse and one
or two shouted "Hurrah for McKmiey."
Tne next stop was at Pueblo. At 10:30
the train entered the yard limits, where
there was a continuous ovation. At the
Union station arches had been erected,
and as the guest left the train he gazed up
a street gayly decorated in flags and bunt
ing. The music of bands was heard, and
rboveallthn cheering of the crowds that
bad poured into the city all the day and
night before. Carriages were in waiting
and Mr. Bryan was driven throu/n the
city; lirst to the Centennial High School,
where about 1000 children were gathered
waving flags. In a short speech he praised
the flag and said:
This flag is the emblem of the National
sovereignty, the thing we carry in time of
battle, thai we use for decoration on the
Fourtn of July and other occasions. I love it
so well that I think it ought not to be used by
any political party. Xo party is big enough to
own that 11 tg. [Cheers.]
I waut you to remember in this country men
aie not born great; they do not derive their
greatness from their ancestors. I rejoice tnat
I live In a land where no man can aold officj
unless the people want him. It is sometimes
inconvenient when they don't want you.
[Laughter.] It is the best form of Govern
mentâdemocracy; the only Government that
cun be made as good as the people deserve to
have.
From school to school he was driven
and the seeno was repeated. The speecn
of the day was made at the Mineral Pal
ace, where he addressed several thousand
people on the political issues of the day,
along the same strain in which, he spoke
while in Denver yesterday.
This being the home of Governor-elect
Alva Adams, that gentleman introduced
Mr. Bryan at the various meetings held.
He was wildly cheered by the people and
then was driven to the Grand Opera-house,
where he spoke to women exclusively, and
then a drive about the city was in order.
At 6:30 Mr. Bryan boarded a train for
his home in Lincoln, passing through
Colorado Springs at 7:30, where a great
crowd had gatnered at tbe station and to
whom he addressed a few words. That
city, which has always been overwhelm
ingly Republican, gave Brvan a majority
of 300 votes, and this was reterred to, one
of the crowd jocularly remarking that the
town was no longer Little Lunnun, but
should be called Little Arkansas. This
produced a laugh.
Mr. Bryen was presenled with a sou
venir book of Colorado wild Mowers by
Mrs. Conrad, the gift of the ladies of the
city, and a few appropriate words were
spoken in recognition, after which Mr.
Bryan resumed his night's journey.
"THE HERO OF 1900 "
Hour William Jenniny* Was Introduced
at Colorado Springs.
COLORADO SPRINGS; Colo., Nov.
25. â William J. Bryan, who has been the
guest of the citizens of Colorado for the
past two days, spoke for a few minutes in
this city this evening. He came from
Pueblo at !â¢'' and was escorted to the
balcony of me Rock island Hotel. The
Rock Island train was held, for him half
an hour. He wns briefly introduced by
Mayor Plumb as the hero of 1900. There
was an audience of 3000 people at the
depot who stood in the November cold to
listen to him. He spoKe against a driv
ing wind. Mr. Bryan began pleasantly by
saying that he had not supposed that there
were so many people who did not know
that the election was over. They act as if
the silver cause had met with a great vic
tory instead of a defeat. Continuing he
said:
It was a victory and we are in the midst of
it campaign. We are organizing for the batWe
of 1900 and to do In 1900 what we failed to do
in 1896 i 1 believe thai ihose who fought so
valiantly for free coinage feel bjtter to-niglit
than those who are wondering who are to
hove thepoKtofllces. In this fight we have
convinced the people that the stiver question
'8 bigger than thÂ» few Â»i!ver-producing States.
We have shown that the people in two-thirds
of tho area of the States believe in it. We
have not only made the movement respect
able In a large part of the country, but we
have clubs that are as zealous and enthusias
tic as you are here. They Delieve tli y are
ri;?ht and are going to fight, for thulr convic
tions. This city his the reputation of having
cast ;he blegest vote m the State for McKln
ley. You then know the arguments, but you
have not heard a single advocate of tne gold
standard who will admit that be does so for
his own int-rest. It is always to help some
body else.
We In the agricultural States have stood with
you who own mines not Jo help you, but to
help ourselves. If we advocate silver it is be
cause we are interested as much eg you are,
and for that reason we are not going to forget
you. Those people abroad who nave been
watching this campaign know that the vic
tory is not overwhelming. There will not be
over fifty majority in Congress and another
overwhelming victory like that will settle the
silver question our way. In four years from
now your majority in favor of free silver will
not be proportionally as large as it is now, be
cause the States with the big populations will
outdo you. We believe that right will prevail,
and we are going to keep It up. We reply to
those who say that we should stop agitating
that they generally agitate until they get
what they want. We are glad that the Repub
licans are saying that they are organizing, be
cause ihe mure we agitate the more converts
we will have.
Mr. Bryan started to his train, but the
crowd made a rush at him and he
had to escape out through the hotel
kitchen. He was presented with a beauti
ful souvenir booK of Colorado wildflowers.
His train pulled out with a cheer from the
crowd, ;.... -v

SUGAR TRUST OBSTACLE.
A Technicality Prevents the Absorption of
the Baltimore Company and Opera
tion of Its Works.
BALTIMORE, Mp., Nov. 25. â The
sugar trust Has encountered an unex
pected obstacle to its control of the Balti
more Sugar Company. Lawyers wbo have
been studying the situation claim that the
recent election of directors which resulted
in the defeat of the old board, composed
of Baltimoreans, and the substitution of a
board in sympathy with the trust, was
illegal. The old management was unani
mously in favor of starting the plant at
Curtis Bay as soon as possible, and had
made arrangements to begin the manufac
ture of sugar by the middle of December,
providing work for t>oo men. The sugar
trust wanted the plant to remain idle, and
at the annual meeting about two weeks
ago showed that it owned a majority of
the stock of the Baltimore company and
therefore elected successors to the Balti
more directors. C. Moreton Stewart was
the only resident of Maryland elrcted a
director, and as the laws of Maryland re
quire that a majority of the directors be
residents of this State, it is the opinion of
several lawyers who have examined the
situation for the minority stockholders
that the election 13 void.
The sugar trust is not considering this
phase of the situation, and it is reported
that it will call the stockholders together
again for the purpose of electing Maryland
residents to the board and avoiding legal
complications which would almost cer
tainly ensue.
Tne minority stockholders have not
abandoned the movement to have the
works opened, and if the sugar trust does
not issue orders that will start the plant
up and enable it to earn returns upon the
$250,000 or more stock held in tins city
within a reasonable length of time legal
steps will be taken to enforce the rights; of
the local interests.

CUETAILING R ILROAD PASSEN.
Radical Change* I'roposed by the Western
Imffic A*Mf>clation.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 25.â The new
agreement regulating the issue of passes
during 1897, which was adopted by the
Western Passenger Association at its
recent meeting in St. Louis, makes a more
radical change in the present agreement
than was believed at the time of the meet
ing. Tbe details were made the subject
of a circular to-day for general railroad in
formation. Next year only the general
manager, president and genera! superin
tendent of a road will have tiie power to
obtain passes for employes or alleged em
ployes from other lines. This curtail
ment of the officials' applications for passes
will be honored, ami is expected to result
in a reduction of tbe number issued by 50
percent. The traffic department, inciud
mg the general freight agent, is barred
from exercising a privilege he now enjoys,
and the influential shipper is expected to
pay his way in future, as it is not believed
freignt traffic officials will confess to their
superiors, by asking for passes for the
shippers, that they get their business by
such methods.
The announcement was made to-day
that John L. Ferguson, now city passenger
ag' nt of the Chicago anil Northwestern
road, will become assistant general pas
senger agent December 1, in charge of
local traffic. Wuiiam M. Dodd, cashier
lh the general passenger department, be
comes city agent.
C. W. Smith, local passenger aeent of
the Burlington road, was appointed to
tlay city passenger ngent at San Francisco,
to succeed the iate F. W. Madeira.
"LET THEM HAVE. A TRIAL."
liberal Attitude, of Senator lioach of
J>orth Jtakota.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 25.â A Tribune
special from Washington says:
Senator Roach of North Dakota, one of
the more conservative of Democrats in the
deliberative branch, does not see any ad
vantage to be gained in offering factious
opposition to a Republican programme of
tariff or revenue legislation. He said yes- |
terday :
"In my opinion it is a question to be
deeded by the R-publicans themselves
whether they desire the passage of the |
Dingley bill or not. As I view it, there |
are some perplexing features of the mat
lÂ«r which the Republicans will doubtless j
weigh carefully and reach a conclusion
on early in the session.
"Speaking for myself, as a Democrat, I j
would not interpose any factional objec
tion to such tariff legislation as the Re
publican majority might possibly desire
to undertake. They say that prosperity
is to follow Republican supremacy, and 1
am willing to let them have a trial, anci,
il it is successful, to give them credit lor
it. Ido not know what general policy the
Democrats in the Senate may decide on,
but thoso with whom I have talked have
not expressed any intention of opposing
the programme of the majority."
NATIONAL REFURMERN.
Call for a Conference in the Interest of
Bimetallism.
NORTH TONAWANDA, N. V., Nov.
25.â Edward Evans, ex-chairman of the
National Reform party, last night issued
a call for a National conference of reform
ers. The call includes the Prohibition
parts', the People's party and the Na
tional Reform party. No city has yet
been decided upon in which to hold the
convention, but it will probably be Chi
caeo.
The object of the conference will be the
union of all parties, and an attempt will
be made to induce those parties to fuse
with the Democratic psrty lor future work.
By doing this, Mr. Ev.uis declares, bi
metallism without international consent
will be more easily brought about in the
election of 1909.
The National Reform party was organ
ized in the last campaign. It is an offshoot
of the Prohibition party and was organ
ized at Pittsburg by delegates who bolted
the regular Prohibition party's nomina
tions. The National Reform party was
composed of those Prohibitionist* who fa
vored the free coinage of silver. Their
candidate for President was Judge Bent
ley of Lincoln, Nebr., a near neighbor of
Mr. Bryan.

LOVE EPISTLES
TO LADY SCOTT
Earl Russell's Letters to
Mother-in -Law Read
in Court.
Wanted Her to Stay With Him
While He Lived Apart
From His Wife.
Declared in Endearing Terms That
His Devotion to Her Was
Ucdy ng.
LONDON, E*O., Nov. 25.â The Central
Criminal Court, Old Bailey, was crowded
this morning, when the trial of Lady
Stlina Scott, John Cockerton, Frederick
Kast and William Aylott for criminally
libeling Earl Russoil, was resumed.
Earl Russeil resumed his place in tbe
witness-box and continued his testimony.
After the failure of the action brought
against him by his wile for divorce, he
said, Lady Scott sent to him an affection
ate Christinas card. Nevertheless the
witness identified a letter written by Lady
Scott subsequent to her sending the
Christmas card promising a sufficient ?um
of money to give a start in life to any
person who would furnish proof that Lord
Russell had been guilty of immoral acts
prior to 1894.
J. L. Walton, M. P., cross - exam
ined Earl Russell on behalf of Lady
Scott. Mr. Walton produced a letter
written by Earl Russell to Lady Scott,
in which the writer began by calling her
"Darling and concluded by saying, "I
shall always love you." Earl Russell ex
plained this by saying that he was sorry
lor Lady Scott, though he did not esteem
her.
Mr. Walton then read other letters
written by Eari Russell to Lady Scott,
wherein he indulged in such expressions
as 11 1 want to give you a last hug. mv
darling," "my lovely one," "dearest,
and other terms of affection. Earl Rus
sell explained his language by saying
that he had written these letters on the
eve of his marriage to Lady Scott's daugh
ter. Later he had written letters to Lady
Scutt expressing a desire that his wife
should not see him. In these letters Lord
Russell alluded to his wife as a stony
hearted, self-righteous saint, and urged
Lady Scott to stay witn him while he
lived apart from his wife.
At tuis point in the proceedings the
Judge intervened, saying that the whole
question was whether or not Earl Russell
was guilty of the offenses with which he
was etiarged.
Mr. Walton then questioned the witness
regarding his alleged misconduct witt a
student at Oxford, and the Earl replied
that at the time tbe allegations were made
against him he demanded of the master
ol the college that tbe charges be thor
oughly investigatea.
An adjournment was then taken.

nent members of the National Democratic
party of lowa held a conference here to-day

that 50,000 sound-money Democrats of
lowa cast their votes for McKinley this
year.
In discussing this letter Colonel Eisbeck
of De 3 Moines said he agreed as to the
number of votes cast for McKinley, but be
lieved there were 60,000 more sound-money

sound-money cause. The following reso
lution was adopted:

ence, composed of members of the National

ganization be continued, and that we pledge
our moral and financial support in a campaign
of education along the lines of the Indianapo
lis platiorm.

the Democrats of the State with a view to
bringing them into line for sound money
and a. tariff for revenue only. It was also

moral support of the organization to the
McKinley administration when it comes
into power in so far as the administration
has to deal with the financial question.

While- an extra ireiglit train was nearing
this place this morning an axle broke.
The rear end of the train was wrecked.
The Southern express was close behind on
another track. Before it could be flagged
it ran into the wrecked train, which had
been spread over the track. The engine,
mail car, two baggage-cars and four
sleepers were derailed.
The passengers, though considerably
shaken up, escaped with few bruises. The
train crew was not so fortunate. Joseph
Meepan, engineer of the express, and his
fireman, H. W. Chichester, were pinned
under the fallen engine. They were
scalded to death in full view of the pas
sengers and trainmen, who were gathered
about, out powerless to aid.
Toe scene was very pitiful. The two
men moaned with agony as the hot water
touched them and the escaping steam
completely enveloped theij. The onlook
ers were frenzied with excitement. They
did everything in their power to aid the
men, but in vain. The heavy machinery
could not be moved in time. "Fortunately
the men did not have to suffer very loug
until death came to their relief.
KITE PHOTOGRAPHY.
Experiments to Be Made on the Nan'
sions of Gotham.
BAYONNE, N. J., Nov. 25.â An attempt
will be made to-morrow to take mid- air
photographs of the important residence
district radiating from Madison Square,
New York. Wiliiam A. Eddy and Henry
L. Allen will send out a line of tandem
kites several feet in diameter from the
roof ot the Hoffman House, Broadway and
Twenty-fifth streets, beginning at 9a. m.
Mr. Eddy says that the weather bureau
predictions of northerly winds indicate a
possibility of variable winds receding to a
calm. He said that should light, variable
winds set in the force may not be sufficient
to lift the camera. Shortly after dark,
time exposures will be tried with the
camera in midair.

FRESNO'S DISPLAY
OF CITRUS FRUITS
Every County of the San
Joaquin Will Send
Exhibits.
Friendly Rivalry Assures the
Success of the Winter
Exposition.
Large Pavilion Under Construction
Near the City's Business
Center.
FRESNO, Cax., Nov. 25. â The San
Joaquin Valley Citrus Fair, which is to be
held in this city next month, promises to
be a great success. Tbe arrangements are
well under way and are on a basis which
will make the exposition the largest ever
held in the valley. The interest of every
county irom San Jonquin to the Tehaciiapi
has been enlisted, :ind fine displays of
citrus fruits and products will be made by
the horticulturists throughout the valley.
A spirit of rivalry has been aroused among
the counties and all will put forth their
best efforts in making exhibits,
' The magnitude of the fair will draw
many visitors from all parts of the coast
aud those from the East who are visiting
in the State at the time. The horticultur
ists will have an excellent opportunity to
show to great advantage what can be done
in the valley in the way of fruit-growing.
The fair will be held during the weet
before Christmas, opening on Monday,
December 14, and closing on Saturday
evening, the 10th. Should circumstances
warrant it will be continued into the next
week. The programme at present is to
keep the exposition open during the one
week only. The purpose of holding the '
fair this early in the season is to show vis
itors that the fruit ripens, in the valley in
advance of other districts in the State and
therefore has tho advantage of the lir.-t
market. The picking will have teen just
commenced, and the most creditable dis- i
plays can then be made. The importance
of citrus-fruit growing in the San Joaquin I
Valley can in this manner be best "im- I
pressed on those whose attention is at- i
tracted for a business purpose.
The exposition will be held in a tempo- j
rary building constructed for the purpose.
It will be located on a vacant lot on I
street, between TuLare and Kern, and very â 
near the business center of ihe city. It
will be directly opposite the Hughes
Hotel. The construction of the building,
which will De made of lumber, is already
under way, and will be completed within
two weeks. The structure will have a |
frontage of 160 feet on I street and 140 on j
Kern, giving it a floor space of 22,400 feet, j
nearly all of which has already been en- |
gaged by exhibitors-. The interior will be
divided into four departments of 35x160 i
feet each, but there will be no partitions, j
The walls will be lined in the inside with I
heavy cloth. The large space which will
be available will insure no cramping of
displays, and the exhibitors will be given
full opportunity for artistic effects.
H. C. B. Gill iias just returned from a
tour of the counties of the valley in be- j
half of the fair. He explained the plans !
and the purposes of the exposition to all
the leading horticulturists, and his recep
tion in all sections was very encouraeing.
No one did be find not enthusiastically in
accord with the movement and desirous of
helping it. The citrus-growers of the val
ley believe that their importance in the j
markets is not realized by buyers, and the j
proposition of holding the lair to call at
tention to the industry in this part of the
State is being eagerly taken up as an ex
cellent opportunity to accomplish this
purpose.
In Kings County the Board of Super
visors made a liberal appropriation for
paying the expenses of an exhibit from
that county. The Commercial Associ
ation of Stockton is taking an active in
terest in the fair, and is planning to make
a tine exhibit.
Though a special feature will be made of
an exhibition of citrus fruits there will
also be displays of other important
products of the valiey. Every county will
be given an opportunity to exhibit the
products of its chief industries. The Stock
ten business men will make a display of
the agricultural products of San Joaquin
County, desiring to have a representation
in the valley fair.
The raisin-packers promise to make a
big display, :ind the attention of visitors |
will also be called to this great industry |
of the valley. All counties will also be in
vited to make exhibits of cereal nnd dried
fruit productions in conjunction with their <
citrus fruit displays.
About $1000 will be expended in pre
miums for exhibits. There will be a
county contest, aud the one making the
best showing will be awarded $100 in cash.
Great interest is being manifested in this. |
an eager desire being developed among |
the horticulturists to capture the honor
and prize for their respective counties.
The exposition is being promoted by
the local Chamber of Commerce and the
Hundred Thousand Club. These have
each appointed a committee of six. wi.ich
are working jointly in the arrangements.
The understanding is no small one, but
it is in good bands. The joint committee
consists of F. K. Prescot!, George C. Roed
ing, Mark Webster. V. J. Gugeenhime,
Henry Gundelfinger. Emil F. Bernhard,
John McMullin, C. P. Wyer, F. M. Chit
tenden. W. li. Uridge, Fulton G. Berry
and John C. Nourse. These are highly
representative business men ot this city,
and all are extensively interested in fruit
growing.
The Board of Supervisors of this county
has appropriated $500 for the use of the
committee, and the trustees of the city
$150. About $1500 has already been sub
scribed to the iund among the local busi
ness men, and tbe financial part of the
fair, the moat important to the committee,
is on an excellent footing.
The Southern Paeifiic Railroad Com
pany has agreed to make a one and one
third fare from all parts of the State dur
ine the fair week. The Valley road is not
yet in a position to say what it will do,
bat a similar reduction, at least, is ex
pected from it.
Many of the exhibits at the fair will be !
turned over to the State Board of Trade to i
be sent to tbe Hamburg exposition. The I
fruit-growers of the valley are also taking j
an active interest in this exhibition.
The arrangements for the valley fair are
b 'ing carried out on an elaborate basis.
As an evidence of this the fact that the
committee will engage the services of sev
eral outside musicians in addition to the
local to make up a band of twenty pieces
to play afternoons and evenings may be
citea.
The citrus-fruit growers of this county
alone had a fair last year, aud their efforts
were rewarded with the unqualified suc
cess of the undertaking. With all the
counties of the valley joining hands there
is no reason why this year's exposition
should not be as successful as any fair
ever held in the State.

SACRAMENTO'S GRAND JURY.
Reforms Advocated in the Final Report
the County's Investigating
Body.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Nov. 25.â The
final report of the Grand Jury of Sacra
mento County was filed to-day in Judge
Johnson's department of the Superior
Court. The report states that the jury
has had fourteen regular meetings, has In
vestigated fourteen cases and examined
sixty-one witnesses. Indictments have
been found against nine and the charges
against five ignored.
A motion was carried by a majority
vote declarine it the sense of the jury that
the present license for retailing liquors in
this county be raised to ?50 per quarter
from $HO, as at present charged. There
are 2G7 places in the county licensed to
sell liquor by the glass, or one to every
thirty-seven voters.
The report says:
We won]d recommend that the Legislature,
at its coming session, materially reduce the
official salaries and fees of county officers.
Real estate, rents and nearly all the staple
products of agriculture have shrunk nearly
one-haifand the profits on all kinds of busi
ness have been greatly reduced.
This undesirable condition of the country
renders it a very diffirult problem for the peo
ple to pay the taxes that are levied from year
toyear; and If there is no remedy to be had
many of our most worthy and enterprising
citizens will become ere long hopelessly bank
rupt.
A dollar now has nearly double the pur
chasing power for all the necessaries of life it
had when the present salaries were fixed by
the Legislature. As a matter of justice we see
no good reason why tbe reduction asked for
sii.-i.iM not be made.
The jury recommends that "the Legis
lature, at its coming session this winter,
â submit an amendment to the constitu
tion, to be voted upon at the next general
election, changing article I, section 7, so
that three-fourtps of a jury may find a
verdict in criminal the same as in civil
actions."

SAN DIEGO, Cal., Nov. 25.â Dispatches
from p]nÂ«enada state that the junk Pe
king, which became notorious in con
nection with the landing of Garratt, the
gold - bar thief, and later was cap

at Rosalia Bay while engaged in illicit
guano traffic, was wrecked on the beach
at Enseneda this morning at 10 o'clock,
having been driven ashore during the gale
last night. A Mexican official, the only

passenger, being entered by a wave, which
ruined everything in the room. The
steamer lay in the lee of Coronado Island
during part of the storm, arriving here
three hours late this morning.
FREENO MURDER TRIAL.
Indian Xedieln* Aan Arraigned for
Killing a Child-
FRESNO. Oal.. Nov. 23.â The trial of
Indian Jake for the murder of his two
year-old stepson at the Big Sandy ranch
eria in the mountains lifty miles east of
this city was begun before a jury in Judge
Church's court to-day.
The defendant claims that lie was play
ing with the child and was pokinz him
with the muzzle of tbe gun when it was
accidentally discharged.
The prosecution has another theory.
It is said that Jake, who is about 60 years
of aae, is a "medicine man," and has for
jrean wielded a despotic power over the
tribe. It is believed that he bad a
dislike for his stepson, and thought he
could do away with him without being
called to account, because a "medicine
man" is not accountable for anything.
One of the stepfather's reasons for his dis
like of the boy is said to have been the
lact that the little fellow was a half-breed.

DELUGE DESCENDS
UPON SAN PEDRO
The Southern Seaport Town
Almost Destroyed by
a Cloudburst.
Torrents of Water Rush Down
the Hills and Invade
the Dwellings.
Buildings Are Removed From Their
Foundations and Basements
F ended.
LOS ANGELES. Cal.. Nov. 25.â The
beautiful seaport town of San Pedro had a
remarkable experience last night which
almost caused its complete destruction.
San Pedro is built on a sidehill gulch
facing the ocean.
The location has given it excellent drain
age, but it came near being the town's
everlasting ruin. A cloudburst above San
Pedro last night produced such a flow of
water down the hillside as to almost sweep
the place out of existence. Buildings were
removed from their foundations and man)
a resident fonnd his house upon his neigh
bor's lot this morning.
This moving of dwellings and other
buildings caused intense excitement and
great consternation for a short time, but,
strange to say, no person was drowned.
Some of the principal streets were washed
out to a depth of twenty feet and were
veritable creeks thi3 mornincr. The dam
age will amount to about $50,000, and in
some respects is irreparable.
. Basements were all flooded and much
perishable property was destroyed. Tele
graph, telephone and electric light wires
were borne down in every direction, and a
lone section of the Southern Pacific track
was washed out or completely covered
with debris and sand.
A steady rain had fallen all day Tues
day, increasing in the night. At about 11
o'clock there was a cloudburst directly
over tbe city. Tremendous torrents
poured through the Htrnets and forced
entrance to dwellings, driving the panic
stricken people to places of safety. Until
morning pandemonium reigned in tbe
town.
To-day the people have been occupied
in taking an invoice of the damage and
replacing their buildings. Many of these
remained intact and in consequence suf
fered little damage. Others were de
molished and swept away in bits and
pieces.
The waters were largely confined to the
main streets, which have in many in
stances be<?n rendered absolutely impas
sible.
An eyewitness describes the scene dnr
ing the rash of water as a most imposing
and awe-inspiring one. The roar could be
heard for mile? around.
PLATES FO R THE KENTECKY.
Thirteen Carload* 'â¢ on the Way From
â :*: Homestead to San i'rnnelteo.
PITTSBURG, Pa., Nov. 25.â Thirteen
Harveyized nickel steel armor â¢ plates,
which will be used in the construc
tion of the barbette for the battle-
ship Kentucky were shipped to San
Francisco from Homestead to-day on
thirteen cars especially constructed for
the purpose. Each car contains one armor
plate, which is seventeen inches thick, ten
feet hiph and fourteen feet iong, each
weighing forty-five tons.
Tlie barbette is the largest and heaviest
ever constructed and the plates were com
pleted in a shorter time than was ever
before accomplished.
The thirteen cars will be rushed through
to San Francisco by a special train and are
to be placed in the new battleship at the
earliest time possible under instructions
from the Secretary of the Navy.

THEY CALL US "YANKEES."
Derivation of the Epithet ag Told by
Washington Irving.
Every one is aware that the word ''Yan
kee" is applied abroad indiscriminately to
all citizens of the United States, but it is
used generally as a 'nickname," and not
always in a ccnplim ntary spirit. Our
Spanish friends just at present are doubt
less inclined to employ it in a sneering
and derogatory sense, but. however it
may be used by them or other Europeans,
it has long since ceased to carry with it
the slightest sting of latent satire. From
a term of reproach or ridicule it has be
come to the citizen of the United States a
verbal badge of honor, and is now synony
mous the world over with shrewdness,
enterprise, pluck and achievement.
Its origin is uncertain. According to
one authority "yankees" is a variation of
"yenkees,"or "yeneees,"or "yaunhhees,"
"a name said to have been given by the
Massachusetts Indians to the English col
onists, being, it is supposed, an Indian
corruption of the word English or of the
French Anglais." Washington living, in
his history of New York, explains the de
rivation somewhat differently. The first
settlers oi New England, he says, came to
America "tv enjoy unmolested the ines
timable ri ht of taluing. And. in fact no
sooner did they land upon tbe shore of
this free-spoken country than they all
lifted up theiÂ»Â»voices and made such a
clamor of tongnes that we are told they
frightened every bird and beast out of the
neighborhood, and. struck such muie
terror into certain fish that they have
been called dumb fish ever since.
"The simple aborigines of the land for
awhile contemplated these strango folk
in utter astonishment, but discovering
that they wielded harmless though noisy
weapons and were a lively, ingenious,
good-humored race of men, they became
very friendly and sociable and gave them
the name Yanokies. which in the Mais-
Tcbusafg (or Massachusetts) language
signifies silent menâ a waggish appella
tion, since shortened into tue familiar epi
thet of yankeee."
It bad gained great currency as descrip
tive of the colonists in 1755, when Dr.
Schuckburgh, British surgeon, it said to
have composed the words of Yankee
Doodle" in derision of the Colonial mili
tia, but the tune to which it was set is de
clared by some authorities to have been
popular in England during the Common
wealth, at which period its doggerel
words, it is alleged, also existed and were
applied to Cromwell.
Whatever its ancestry and original sig
nification, it has come in the light uf his
tory and accomplishment to be a desig
nation of which the people of tnis country
have no reason to be ashamed. They have
no objection to being called by a nick
name which is so associated with daring,
skill, energy and triumph that even when
used in derision or anger it creates in the
mind of the very railer or scoffsr a secret
feeling of envy. The Englishman, French
man. German, Russian, Spaniard and the
rest will have to content themselves with
their narrow national appellations, except
on special occasions of merit, when they
show themselves worthy of being deco
rated with the Yankee cross of honor and
being complimented with the title of Eng
lish, or French, or Spanish Yankees. The
suggestion as to the selection of some
olher nickname than "yaniee" may be
wise, but it is not practicable. -Nobody
would ever adopt it here or abroad. Let
us be content with tbe designation as it is.

NO USE FOR LITE.
Two Old Men to Whom Thankggiving
Held Out No Pleaawnt Thoughts.
OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 25.â Two old
men to whom life offered no attraction
and who certainly did not look forward to
Thanksgiving with any of the feeling that
should actuate the human heart, passed
away last niijht, one by his own hand, the
other, according to common-law praseol
ogy, "by the hand of God."
Adolph Tuthe, an inmate of tbe County
Infirmary, died early this morning from
laudanum poisoning. He was old and poor
and the thought of living on charity
caused him to be very despondent. Early
yesterday morning Tuthe swallowed about
two ounces ol laudanum, but not until 2
o'clock this morning was hit work com
plete. The inmates of his ward were dis
turbed about midnight by his heavy
breathing. They aroused the physician,
who tried to save the old man's life, but
without success. The deceased must have
got the poison from the outside, as it was
not possible for him to get it from the dis
pensary in the infirmary.
Tuthe was a German by birth, 71 years
of age, and had lived at the county's ex
pense for five years.
Some time last night another old man
sat down on a bench near the Fruitvale
station. No one noticed him and this
morning when he was seen still sitting
there with his cane by his side and bis hat
tipped forward it was thought he was
sleeping.
C. A. Lund when passine noticed that
t tie old man did not breathe. So with the
help of others he laid the body on the side
walk and tried to revive life. Their efforts
were wasted as the man had been dead
some hours. Nothing was in his pockets
which might disclose his identity. His
clothes were well worn, his hair was gray,
and he was about 55 years of age. The
remains are now at the Morgue waiting to
be identified.
BANNISTEE PAILS
The Partner of the Lute A. I>. Starr
Files an Insolvency Petition.
OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 25. â Alfred
Bannister, commission merchant of San
Francisco, residing at Berkeley, filed a
petition in insolvency late this afternoon.
It shows that his debts amount to
$.'3,tj2B 04.
Alfred Bannister was best known as a
partner of the late A. D. Starr in the Starr
Milling Company and he figured for many
months in litigation connected with the
firm in the courts of this county.
The only assets which appear are house
hold furniture nnd personal effects in
Berkeley valued at $500 and which are de
clared to be exempt from execution.
The San Francisco Savings Union is a
creditor for two notes, one of $10,500 and
another of $400, secured by a trust deed to
fifty-three lots in Berkeley.

CURED THE MULE.
A Keinedy for Balking That Worked
Like n Charm.
"I was ridinjj along a mountain road in
Eastern Kentucky a few weeks ago," re
marked a traveling salesman to a Wash
ington Star reporter, "when I saw a mule
running toward me with a single-tree
dangling at his heels. With great diffi
culty I succeeded in turning out of his
way, and he continued to go down the
mountain at a lively pace.
"About a mile further on I saw two
front wheels of a spring wagon, and a
short distance away the other wheels and
a wagon box. 1 looked around to see if
the driver had been hurt, but, finding no
one, drove on.
"In a few minutes I met a man walking
down the road rather hastily. 'Stranger,'
he queried, 'didyo' see a mewl down thar?'
'â¢ "Yes.' '
" 'Did he hey a rag over 'is year?'
" 'I didn't see any.'
" 'Waal, it's all right, I reckon Vll atop
when he gits flustered out, an' I reckon
Vs cured.'
" 'What is he cured of?' I asked.
" 'Balkin'. Yo' see, I had heerd thet a
grasshopper put in th' year o' a boss or
mewl 'd cure 'im from baikin', so I tied a
rag over th 1 critter's year so it couldn't git
out, cotched a grasshopper, put 'im in an'
stranger, it's the best remedy I ever seed.
Th' mewl didn't giv me time to git in th'
wagon. I never did see a mewl so
sprightly. I reckon th' hopper's got out
now, an I'll go on an' cotch th'j mewl.' "
Bicycl|ng Not a "Craze."
It is an error to call bicycling a "craze."
It is something very different from that
The simple fact is that the human race
has discovered a new power for its own
use. From the earliest dawn ol civiliza
tion man has been experimenting with
the wheel, which he invented to increase
his powers of locomotion. Finally he has
hit upon a device which makes his own
body the source of power. He has placed
wheels upon his feet and as a result finds
his powers of locomotion multiplied by five
and even ten. Instead of walking liveor ten
mileÂ» with more or less effort and fatigue,
he finds himself traveling ten, twenty,
fifty, and even a hundred miles, according
to his physical vigor and experience, with
little perceptible fatigue and with a most
delightful sense of animation. He bas be
come master of hi.Â« new power â tbe most
valuable he has acquired since he learned
to walk â and it is henceforth a part of his
equipment for his struggle with life. It is
probable that having once become pos
sessor of a power like this the human race
is going to abandon it? As well might we
expect it to abandon railways, ana gas,
and electricity.â The Forum.

THE SEA HOLDS
FAST ITS DEAD
Futile Search for Bodies
of the San Benito
Victims.
Survivors Are En Route to San
Francisco on the Point
Arena.
Ranchers and Townspeople Busily
Engaged in Carrying Away
Wreckage.
POINT AREXA, Cal., Nov. 25.â The
steamer Point Arena, from Mendocino for
San Francisco, put in here at 12:30 o'clock
this afternoon, three hours and a half
ahead of her usual time. She has on
board the thirty-seven survivors, includ
ing Captain Smith, of the wrecked steamer
San Benito and left for San Francisco at
2:30 o'clock. When the steamer tied up
a dozen firemen, coal-passers and seamen
marched the mile up the hill from the
wharf to the town to see the sis survivors
at the hotel here. They carried at the
head of their little procession the rem
nants of the flag of the San Benito, which
fluttered as cheerfully as it could under
the circumstances. Only about half of
ibe flag remained. The other half had
been blown away before it was rescued.
It is a white flag with the name of the
steamer in big, red letters, but the name
on the flag is cut in two amidship, as tbe
steamer was. All the letters that remain i
are "San B."
There was a hearty handshake between
those brawny men when they met at the
hotel. They did not say much; the grip
of the hand expressed much more than
they spoke.
A small party from town went out to
the wreck at an early hour this morning
to look along the shore for bodies. None
were found. The vessel lies between the
moutbs of Brush and Alder creeks, and
they went up as far as tbe latterâ about
two miles. The current in the bite sets
that way, and it is thought that when the
sea becomes calm tbe bodies will be found
near the mouth of Alder Creek.
The sun was shining to-day, but a stiff
northward gale was blowing outside, the
wind being very cold. The vessel still
stands as stie broke in two, with mighty
seas rushing over her. Both pieces are
firmly embedded in the *<and and do not
roll a particle. It is considered a wonder
thpt the wreck has held up so well against
the onslaught of the heavy seas. Small
parties along the shore are carrying away
the wreckage that is thrown on the
beach. When the sea moderates there
will be a ru.<h of small boats, loaded with
rancners and townspeople, ior the wreck
lor the large quantities of hams, bacon,
canned meats and other provisions and
things known to be on board.
JUST BEFORE THE COLLISION.
The Thought* That Flash Through the
Engine Man's Brain.
There is something attractive about rail
road life to the man who once enters it.
The railroad companies rarely give up* a
reliable, faithful man. He may become
maimed and unlit for the most remunera
tive positions and be forced to accept t^ome
humbler place with a smaller salary at
tached to it, but it is an unwritten law
with most of the great railroad corpora
tions that the man who is injured in their
service shall be placed in some position
where he may obtain his livelihood.
Thus it may happen that when you fall
in conversation with the man who occu
pies a humble switch house or a flagman's
shanty, you are talking with one who has
had nis share of excitement, and been
through experiences that would make the
hair of the average man stand upon end.
A reporter met a switchman the other
day, the pathos of whose life was ex
pressed in the wooden leg which he nsed,
and as the Empire dashed by he looked up
aud said :
"Yes, I like railroading. I have been in
the business all my lite, and expect to
soend the rest of my days over the rails, j
but I am quite content to remain here in !
my little cottage and tend to my flagging
ruttier than have the position of the man
who noids the throttle on that bin engine
which just whizzed by here. You may
think it a snap to sit there and ride over
the country at the rate of a mile a minute, '
but I tell you that man carries a loaa of |
responsibility on his shoulders which I j
would not want on mine, and which tbe
average man knows v ry little about. I i
know something of it, f6r I was fireman ;
some years ago on one of the fast engines, I
and lost my leg in an accident between I
here and Aiuany. But if I had come out
of that accident as you are I never snou'd
have been able to hold my nerve for any
more fast trips. That finished me for
that work."
"Then if a man has been hurt in a rail
road ccklent it makes him scary of that
kind of work, does it?" asked the re
porter.
"You bet it does," answered the switch
man with emphasis, "and don't let any
one fool you that it don't. The man who
was running that engine the day I was
hurt escaped with hardly a scratch, but
he never could keep his time up tbe wav
he dia before thai, and finally was put on
a freight engine where the running was a
great deal slower.
"1 shall never forget the way he looked
the afternoon the smash-up occurred.
Just before the crash came 1 looked at
him. We were rounding a curve down by
ncuenectady. Hh long gray hair was
flowing in the breeze, bib face set and his
eyes fixed on the track ahead.
"All at once he jumped to his feet and
reversed the lever and exclaimed in a
startled tone. 'My God, we are caught!'
It was probably not more than half a min
ute after when I was lying beneath the en
gine with my Jeg crushed, ut'eriy uncon
scious of the fact that a wreck had oc
curred, but every movement and occur
rence of that half minute is as vividly im
pressed upon my mind as if it had taken
weeks of time to impress it there.
"As he MDOfce I looked through the cab
window ahead of us, and there, within
twenty robs, was a freight engine coming
straight at us, and there was no possible
chance to escape a crash. The engineer
was dcing his duty. I knew that. He
was reversing his lever, applying the
brakes and doing his best to avert what
he knew was inevitable, but I bad nothing !
to do. and it seemed as if everything in my
life was before me in those few seconds. I
felt absolutely sure I was going to die.
Strange as it may seem, the thought did
not seem horrible to me. A whole lot of
the slang sayings, sue . as 'You are learn
ing to fire here in this world, so as to be
prepared for the next,' and 'You won't
mini a not job over there,' and a number
of those state things which a fireman has
to take, came into my head, and even in
that awful position it occurred to me in a
sort of humorous way that I had made a
good start here below, or here above, as l
might say. The next moment I was
thinking of mv wife and children, yes
and of mother, too, who had been dead a
number of years. A man always thinks
of his mother at such a time. But I don't
think I had a particle oi fear of death.
The last thing that was on ivy rtind was
the question, Who was to blame for the
accident? and that is the last I remember.
"When I came to my senses I wa3 in a
hospital and was minus a Jeg. Since then
I have been constantly employed one way
and another by the railroad company;
but I never see one of tbe fast trains go by
without thinking of that wreck. The en
gineer miraculously escaped with scarcely
a bruise, but it finished him for that kind
ol work. He was always seeing engines
ahead of him after that, and I have heard
that more than once he had slowed up his
train in order not to collide with an imag
inary engine, <vhicb I have no doubt was
as real to him as it was on the afternoon
the wrecK I speak of occurred. As I said
before, be was transferred to a freight en
gine, but even there he was timid, and
finally left the road altogether.
"You can put it down a3 a pretty sure
tbing that when an engineer has been in
an accident once he is minus a good share
of the nerve which it takes to make his
runs on time to the tick, and if he isn't on
time he has got to go, sooner or later." â

WHO THE CHOSEN PLAYERS ARE.
THK BLUE AND GOLD.
Captain O. AY. Ransome will serve his college
for the fourth year as fullback. Coming from
the Oakland High School in 1892 a good foot
bal'.-player he was at once put on the Varsity,
and has maintained his place continuously,
having lined up already against the cardinal
four timesâ in three regular intercollegiate
Thanksgiving games and in the freshman
garae of '92.
His work has been characterized throughout
his football career with such brilliancy that
when it came to elect a successor to Captain
Sherman Ransome was pre-eminently the man
for the place.
His kicking has been a feature of every game
he bas entered, though in the last intercol
legiate it was not up to standard because of a
serious sprain ot the right knee whlc'u he sus
tained a lew days beiore the game.
He has met with the same im>fortune again
this season, and for a time grave duubts were
expressed as to whether he would be able to
play to-morrow, but despite his indispqsition
he will enter the eaine. and to win, for he says
that it will be the lest chance of his iife, as he
grnduates next May.
Berkeley's captain has just reached his ma
jority; he stands G feet in his stockings and
will enter the game weighing ISS pounds
stripped.
Sterling D. Carr, center, is ia his twentieth
year, stands 5 feet 11 inches and weighs 180
pounds. He has played football for a number
of years, having captained the Berkeley teÃm
during his senior year. While there he played
at tackle and at half, filling each position
equally well.
Last year, which was his freshman year ac
the university, he plnyed half in the freshman
intercoilogiate match and Inter substitute in
the same position on the Varsity. His work
on the Berkeley gridiron has always been
characterized by a remarkable amount of
dÂ«sh and energy. It was these qualities which
won for him the position of center on this
year's team, together with hi< extraordinary
development ot neck and shoulder muscles.
For a time much doubt was expressed as to
whether Carr would make the team, but his
development was so rapid and his knowledge
of the game grew so fast :het he beat out iv
the race for the place lour other men, each of
whom was much heavier than himseit. He
gets into play* remarkably well for a man who
has not. practiced the position ior more than a
I fortnight. His passing,
! however, is inaccurate,
j especially witli a slip
py ry bail.
J. M. Walthall, left
guard, is another Var
sity player who served
the blue and gold in
1895. He stands ii feet
3 inches in height,
weighs 195 pounds.and
is in his twenty-fifth
year. Though but a
player of two years' ex
perience his football
career has been markea
with the lines of liat
teriug success. He
commenced 'aityeara
green pleyer, but so
rapid was his develop
ment into Varsity form
that he beat out all op
i pnents for his place.
In the game he was
â  distinguished for I.ls
! cool-headedi.ess and a
â  determination to Keep
I the man opposite from getting the better of
I him. Though not an especially aggressive
I player, he hoids back bin opponent with much
1 success. Though he has been over from the
I law colleere for ouly a lew days this season, he
; has rounded into fairly good form. Having
j done hnrd manual labor all summer, he was
:in training when he came over. Most of his
j time has been sDent in learning the signals
and getting back his wind.
F. 0. Greisberg, who will play right guard.
is a member of the class of '99, and has had
but two seasons of football experience. Last
year he played center on the freshmen team,
and was a prime factor in running ud the score
of 44 to 0 against the Palo Alto team. He
stands 6 feet in height, weighs 195 and is 22
years of age. He is strong and active,
but has a tendency to loaf in his
position. He is slow to line up aud slow to get
down the field through his men. Greisbcrg is
n good tackier, seldom failing to bring down
hi< mr.ll in his tracks. While unaggressive,
he seldom allows his opponent to pass him
until the clanger point has been passed. As to
muscular strength and solidity he prot>ably
excels any other man on the team, and in con
sequence is possessed of great endurance and
staying qualities.
R. H. Ludlow, right tackle, is a sophomore.
His preparatory truimng was received at the
}ms -Angeles High School, where ne played for
two years at guard. At present he weighs 185
pounds and is in his twenty-firnt year. Lust
season he gave his opponents a hard race for
tuck!", but was beat out by Reinhardt and
Simpson. From the becinnine of the present
season he haR had a "cinch" on the Varsity
!as the boys all say. Whether Butterwcrrtti
would finally decide to put him at tackle or at
BUiirU wns a mooted question. For about ten
days Ludlow was first played at one position
and then the other.
Finally it waÂ« settled that he should play
tackle ax a mate to Simpson. He is conscien
tious and painstaking in liiÂ« work, but stiil he
has many rough edges to work oIV. He is tlow
in lining up n:ni in getting through to break
up interference. While a last runner and
quick to get down the Held on kicks, he noes
not teckie well, in most cases getting his man
too high. He has been quite as fortunate as
any other man on the team in escaping serious
injuries during the practice season, and as a
consequence he has been able to play through
out the entire time.
F. W. Simpson, who will play left tackle, is
in his twenty-fourth year, weighs 182 pounds

moH ot the reserved seats having already
gone at $1 50, |2 and $2 50 each, according
to location.
Two thirty-five minute halves will be
played with an intermission of ten min
utes between the halves.
For game officials the two universit7
managers have agreed upon Harvey of
and stands 5 feet and 7 inches in height, lie
entered college last year as a special student,
entirely ignorant of the first principles of foot
ball, but after a short time he began to show
great aptitude for thÂ» game, and by the end of
the season was in Varsity form, and would
have made the first eleven, hud he not been
disqualified from entering the intercollegiate
on account of study requirements.
He was ranked as the star nlayer of tie '99
freshman team last season. Returning to the
gridiron again this season he has practiced
steadily and is now In fairly good condition,
though his play has not been characterized
by the snap and energy which marked bis
wonk lest season. There is not a speedier
player in the team man Simpson, though he
becomes , erratic at times. In to-morrow's
game he promisea to give Thomas a hard rub.
W. F. .YcNutt, 97, who will play left end,
has won his place through only one season's
work. , He commenced playing . about six
weeks ago and has been out every night since.
Having payed on the Cogswell Institute team
In his "'prep" days, he was not altogether a
novice at the game. He did a little lootball
work in his freshman year, but did not come '
out as a Varsity candidate until this season.
He is in his twenty-first year, weighs 102
pounds and stand; 5 feet 8 inches in height.
.1. \V. Crate, '99, lett end, is just 19 years of
age. He weighs 155 pounds and is 5 feet 8
Inches in height. In his freshman year he
played a little, but did not gain much dis
tinction. His hard, conscientious and untir
ing wort won for. him the place this season,
though, he had a hot rival in Hopper, lie
promises to give Jeff?, the Stanford crack end,
a hard time to-morrow.
Kugene Kennedy will play quarter again
this season. He began his career in the San
Francisco Boys' High School, where he played
quarter also. During his first two years in
college he was oscillated between quarter and
half, but in his junior year he maae the latter
place on the Varsity. He is said to be playing
his olace as well as any other miinon the coast.
Kennedy is just ill, \veigl:s 150 pounds and
stands 5 fee*. 0 inches in height.

THE CARDINAL.
The following information may be of public
interest concerning the individuals of the
Stanford team:
Ju her center, T. M. Williams, best known to
his friends as "Old Heff" (after Hefieinnger)
Stanford centers her hopes. Williams Is a
West Virginian, but not the least bit like the
characteristic Southernerâ quick in big move
ments and easily aroused to ire. He is just the
opposite, being deliberate in his speech as in
his actions; good-natured to a degree almost
unpardonable in a football player, but that
doesn't seem in the least to injure Heff's play
ing. Once get him into a game and ho is a
different man. He goes into a p!ny with bull
dog tenacity and his enormous strength
makes light work of any but a skilled and
sturdy opponent. William* has the reputa
tion of being the best cente- on the coast, not
only for his lair, clean, hard playing at cen
ter, buifor bis reliability in emergencies and
his tine tackling. He is very strongly built
and is a terror at pushing his way througl) a
line, as he piays right down on the ground.
Massachusetts Institute of Technology to
act as umpire, Hinculey of West Point to
act as referee and Ames of Wejt Point to
act as linesman.
The total stripped weight of the Stan
ord team as it will go on the field is 1943
pounds, that of the California eleven 189G
pounds. Stanford's seven linemen weigh
1262 pounds and California's 1254 pounds.
In the evening the California team and
its supporters will witness at the Audi
torium an original farce, pro luced by Ber
keley student talent. Tiie Stanford team
and enthusiasts of the cardinal will assem
ble at the California Theater to witness a
burlesque entitled "Tue Macbeths of
tferkeley," in which the best Palo Alto
student talent will participate. The rolays
for each of the university performances
were written by two clever alumni, who
together edit Josh, the intercollegiate
weekly. -
He is 2.5 years old; height, 5 feet 11 inches;
stripped weight. ISti pounds. He played his
first football at S nnford and made the Varsity
ln>t year. He is now a senior and has an ex
cellent record In his majur studyâ physiology.
To Williams' left is Captain anil Guara
Charles M. Fickeri. There is no man on lier
team that Stanford would be willing to trust
more to than di^.nt Fickert, for he is a giant,
being G feet 1} 2 inches in his stocking feet ana
tipping the beam stripped at 195 pounds.
He is a native son, hailing from Kern County,
near Tehachapi, and is a wonderfully strong
man physically. Accustomed from ills child
hood to outdoor lif * and exercise ho has built
up a muscular physique that makes him a
model guard, lie ulavs low, and rivals Bert
Oliver of the Reliance team in the way begets
Into interference. At tockiing he is as sure
as any man who will play on the team.
and when once he gets h'r>ld of a runner he
never falls to bring him down. This is Fick
ert's third year on the Varsity, and In both
previous Intercollegiate matches he has dis
tinguished hlmselt. In the first game he
blocked Kansome's kick and made it possible
for Stanford to score; In the game last year he
held Berkeley's pet, "Strong Man TluJikett "
to a standstill and easily outplayed him
Walter ramp had great admiration for Fidk
ert as a player ana recommended him to Crots
as a man who "never tired or sot hurt and
who played with greater and greater vigor as
the game became closer and harde-." In the
game to-day Fickert says he will try to prove
thtu because a man is captain that responsi
bility need not interfere with the strength of
his game nor his ability as a player Fickert
is a junior aud his major study is history
Williams' right hand man is Guard Na
thaniel A. Carle, '98. of Seattle, Wa.Â«n. Fickert
Williams and Carle form what Stanford be
lieves-will prove an invincible center. Carie
is the heaviest man on the team, weighing at
the present time 213 pounds stripped and
standing six feet in his stockings. This is
Carle's second year on tho Stanford team and
he is putting ud a stronger game now than he
did at any time last year. He is very light on
his feet and active as a cat. His first football
was plnyed in Seattle as hHlfback, the yiear be
fore no entered Stanford. The man who plays
opposite Carle has no picnic, but is likelvto
Â»>e kept pretty busy during the game. Carle
is 21 years of age and has a high record as a
student. Ills major study is mechanical en
gineering. .

player ever had a tet
ter record for ham
conscientious work. He
slashes through the

the best tackles at
Stanford. He Is a hard
man to block ami he
rnnswell with the ball. Rice is 21 years old,

170 pounds, and is studying to be a geologist.
C. A. Thomas, Stanford's right tiiekle, lins
played for three years on ihe Stanford second
eleven and in most all positions. He has had
experience as center, us guard, as tackle ana
Iml (tack. No player has worked more faith
fully to win a place on the team, and he
should prove a valuable man to the eleven.
When he trios hard Thomas is a most effective
player, but he cannot always be depended
upon. Occasionally nls gome is as strong and

first year that he has devctcd any attention 10

Sweet is sunshine after rain.
Don't miss the football match.
Conditions are good and prospects are
better.
Will Berkeley win or Stanford? That is
the question.
May everybody have a turkey appe tite
and also the bird.
For every party to-day there is plenty of
turkey and no crow.
Those who have done most for charity
Will have most joy in the feast
Even the man who gets the goose to

Lst us hope tbat even Tom Watson will
be rilled with content and satistied to-day.
Protection to industry is assured and
there is joy in the home of the working

The early rains gixe us a fair assurance
of coming crops and all things are pro
pitious to the thankfulness of the day.
It was the Republican victory that
assured prosperity, but the rejoicing is
National and the feasting is for every
body.
If the hope of heing elected in 1900 adds
any cheer to Bryan's Thanksgiving to-day
there will be uo objection to his indulg
ing it.
Mark Hanna wants no cabinet pud
ding. He gets his deserts in the approval
of the people for a difficult duty abiy and
nobly do:.e. %
The Vallejo papers made a combined
right against gambling in that city and
have won. The games have stopped ana
the gamblers are going.
Ihe people of the United States wers
never in a bett-r humor for a festival than
at this time, and it is doubtful if there is
turkey enoueh in the country to satisfy
the demand.
California produces neither egg 9, chick
ens, cheese nor butter enough to supply
her own people, and it will be seen, there
fore, that rural induslry has lots of room
for development.
Arizona was a little sorry over the defeat
of the silver party, but she rejoices in the
rise in the price of copper, and wiil have
her share in the ThanksyiviuE along with
the rest of the country.
There has been no fake on our part In
tiie airship story. There is some caus*
for tbe strange lights which so many peo
ple have seen and The Call can be
counted on to find it out.
The newspapers of every section of the
State renort good prospects for all indus
tries and show cleariy that the people
have a more cheer. ul feeling than has been
known ioi a long time past.
There is danger that the State editors
feasted so fully at Vallejo that they will
not be able to do jus:ice to the home tur
key, and we may hear complaints from
the interior before the weetj is over.
The heroism displayed during the wreck
ing of the San Banito is another evidence
of the courage of American sailors and
attest* once more that vhe virtue of man
hood is always equal to whatever danger
comes.
The very fact that so many reputable
people believe they have seen an airship
is a proof the world is ready for that in
vention, and when the public is weli pre
pared for anything it is never long before
it comes.
The Denver Times cordially indorses the
movement for tne appointment of a Secre
tary of Mines ana will take an active part
in the agitation lor it, and so the good
cause goes forward and increases in
strength as it goes.
The fact that the Republican Home
Market Club of Boston greeted Cleveland's
name with cheers shows how completely
we have returned to feelings of good
humor. There are no longer any animosi
ties. \Ve are all for prosperity and gene
ral rejoicing.
The Yuma Sentinel declares that within
the next year more capital will be invested
in mines and irrigation in Aiiiima than
has ever before been done or thought of,
so you need not be surprised if you hear
\urua talking of municipal development
and city extension this winter.
According to the State Dairy Bureau, no
oleomargarine has been manufactured in
Cahforn.a since July, 181*5, and very few
rilled ciieeses have been made or imported,
and it would sem that since the dairy law
of two years ago has worked bo well we
might extend it to other adulterated
ioods.
A call has been issued by Morrison I.
gwift of Berkeley and a number of other
reformers for a new political organization,
to be known as the "Public Ownership
Tarty," but it will hardly be needed. Ii
this country a political party dees not
have to ba called. If it is coming at all
it will come of itself.
THANKSGIVING DAY.
The present generation of the people of
the United States haÂ» never before in its
history been in such humor for tnanfcs
cjiving as it is to-day.' As Senator Hoar
well said at the jubilee banquet of the
Home Market Club on Tuesday night:
'â¢It will take more than one day for
Thanksgiving tins year. No private
dwelling, no church, no ordinary building,
can contain our joy." It is in the fullest
sense a National rejoicinsr. and they will
be few indeed who fail to take part in it.
The American people have at all times
abundant reasons for being thankful for
ne conditions under which they live.
Our land so far surpasses all others in its
natural resources and its returns to labor,
our Government is so much more free
than otliers, our people so far superior in
intelligence, education and enterprise,
and the opportunities for advancement
are so much greater than in other land*,
that however heavy may be such tem
porary evils as weigh upon us at any par
ticular time, we can still find abundant
reason on Thanksgiving day for gratitude
and for rejoicing.
This year, however, in addition to those
good things which are permanent in our
soil, our government and our social struc
ure, there are many blessings peculiar to
tbe time. The chief of these is unques
tionably that which has resulted From the
last election. We are now assured that
the people of the United States are not
moved by sectional prejudices or class an
tagonisms, and are not subject to tbe ex
citing appeals of demagogues. In that
assurance we find not only prosperity to
day but conlid-.'nce in the endurance of
prosperity for the rest of this generation.
It is with rejoicing minds and i;rateful
hearts, therefore, we can turn our atten
tion to-day to the observance of tbe great
National festival. The celebration in
which we are to en age is peculiar to our
country. No other land shares it with us,
and yet it is not a day associated with any
sentiment that belongs exclusively to
Americans. It is a day .of devout thanks
giving to the Giver of all good and bears
witness to the grateful heart of the Amer
ican people in the midst of tbe abundance
which they enjoy.
We may be sure the day will be marked
by a charity not less abundant than the
thanksgiving. The American people are
not selfish. Tbey do not celebrate their
holidays for themselves alone. There will
be an earnest desire this morning that
every family in the Union should share
in the joy of the festal day. This desire
will not waste itself in idle wishes. It will
be manifest in a thousand generous ac
tions. Every effort will be made by thoje
who are favored to give gladness to those
who have been less fortunate, and there
will be few people in the wide extent of
our Republic who do not have a sufficiency
of the good things of the earth wherewith
to feast themselves.
GOOD PROSPECTS.
It is a noteworthy feature of the times
that the press of almost every section of
the United States has a more buoyant,
cheerful and sanguine tone than has been
known for a Ion _â¢ time past. This is par
ticularly true of the country press, where
the editors are in closer touch with the
people than is possible for metropolitan
journalism. If, therefore, the press is any
true mirror of the commnnity we may
be sure the American people have rarely,
if ever, been more contented with present
conditions or more certain of better things
to come.
The sancuine hopefulness on the part of
the press is strikingly illustrated by the
newspapers of Arizona. If there was any
portion of the Union which had apparent
reason for being dissatisfied with the re
sult of the election it was that Territory.
Arizona is rich in silver mines, and to
these mines she has hitherto looked
mainly for the increase of her wealth and
her population. The defeat of the Silver
party was therefore a severe blow to her
people. Nevertheless, even from Arizona
we hear nothing but words of pood cheer
and reports of increasing prosperity.
The Arizona Sentinel of Yuma says:
"At no period iri the past have the pros
pects looked brighter for Yuma than at
present, and we believe that ere another
twelve months pass the inhabitants of
I Yuma will see more capital invested In
mines and more irrigation enterprises
undertaken than have ever before been
done or thought of by the most enthusi
astic admirer of Yuma's future pros
perity."
The Arizona Republican of Phoenix notes
the 10 per cent advance in the prise of
copper since the election of McKinley.
and says that as some of the finest copper
mines are to be found in that Territory
it goes without saying the advancing
price will have a mo-t beneficial effr-ct
upon the welfare of the people. The Re
publican adds: "The chances are that
before the beginning of tlie new year the
mining industry in Arizona will have re
vived to such an extent that even the
present croakers will have to admit the
country is on the up grade at last."
When such reports come from Arizona
we may be sure the rest of the country is
cheerful. In fact, as we have said, there
is not a newspaper from any portion of
the Union which is not at this time exult
ing in reviving industry and setting forth
the prospects of an increasing prosperity
in the future.
The interior pres9 of California, we are
glad to say, sounds a note even more san
guine and more hopeful than that of other
Btates. We find everywhere evidence th:it
the energies of the people are aroused ?o
the undertaking of new enterprises with
an assured confidence of profits, and we
can count therefore with a.most absolute
certainty upon a rapid development of
all industries and a vast advance in the
j welfare of all the people.
THOROUGH PROTECTION.
In all the discussion on the possibility
of passing the Dingley bill at the coming
session of Congress there has been nothing
which dealt with the subject more effectu
ally than a resolution of the M nnufacturers'
Club of Philadelphia calling for "the re
enactment of the so-called McKinley tariff
of 1890, witii puch changes as shall make
that measure more sironply protective
while insuring a iar.-er revenue."
This resolution covers the whole sub
ject. It zoes directly to the point and
deals with it comprehensively. The peo
ple of the United Stales desire not only a
revenue lor the Government, but protec
tion for home industry. They wish no
compromise measure whose passage would
endanger or delay the enactment of a
thorough comprehensive protective tariff.
It is for that reason that they look with
disfavor upon the Dinjrley bill and take
little interest in the efforts of those who
are trying to promote its adoption fay Con
gress this winter.
The American Economist has very aptly
defined conservative protection as that
kind of protection whic > conserves every
American industry. Protection is perfect
only when it is universal. It is in that
respect that the Dingley bill falls short of
the demands of the people. It gives
souettiing of protection to some indus
tries, but it leaves others, and among
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 26, 1896.
them the great sugar industry of Califor
nia, inadequately provided for.
President-elect McKinley owed his nom
ination at St. Louis by the Republican
party wholly to the fact that his name
was more intimately associated with the
protective system and the tariff bill of
1890 than that of any other statesman of
the day. He was looked apon as the par
ticular champion of American industry,
aiid was therefore logically the leader of
the Republican party in the contest for a
return to the protective system. It was
for that reason he was nominated, and it
was for that reason he was elected. The
Republican party, therefore, would fall
short of popular expectation if it accepted
any compromise on the tariff or entered
into any arrangement that would delay a
return to full and complete protection.
THE AIRSHIP.
.Few things of recent occurrence have
been more gratifying to The Cali, than
the way in which its reports of the airship
have been received by the public. That a
story so strange and so beamingly improb
able as this should have found a wide
acceptance when coming from The Call
is conclusive evidence that the people are
aware The Call deals in no fakes, and
that whatever it reports is well founded
on reason and on fact.
Public opinion on the subject was well
expressed by Editor Walden of the Napa
Journal at the State editors' convention
in Vallejo, !n saying that while he was
incredulous of the airship he did not like
to disbelieve the many persons of known
i veracity c aiming to have optical evidence
lof its existence. Mr. Walden added : "II
! the story had appeared In any other paper
! than The Call I should have paid no at
tention to it."
This and other expressions of popular
confidence in the reliability and accuracy
of The Call's reports on all matters of pub
lic interest are in the highest degree grati
fying. It will be borne in mind The Call
has never asserted the existence of an air
ship, and never lias undertaken even to
j describe on its own authority the strange
light which has been seen. It has given
only the reports of those who claimed to
have seen it, and who being persons of
reputation and good standing in the com
munity are entitled to public confidence
I in what they say.
The subject is one of popular interest
and of no little public importance. It is,
therefore, nothing more than proper that
a newspaper which aims to give all the
news all the time, and give it accurately
every time, should gather these reports
and seek diligently to find upon what cause
they are based. This is what The Call
his done and will continue to do.
It is evident thai so many men of good
understanding cannot be wholly deceived
in a matter of such a nature. There is
certainly some cause for tbe strange lights
which so many intelligent people have
seen and described. That cause we are
now seeking out. We have no intention
nor object to deceive the pubic. We aim
simply to make known the truth. The
readers of The Call may rely upon it that
they will receive aa early as possible a full
and complete explanation of the mystery
whatever that may b?. There is certainly
some cause for the light and The Call
will find it out.
NEWSPAPER INFLUENCE.
Tne influence of newspapers, when all !
j which are published in any community |
are united for a good cause, has been strik
ingly shown in Vallejo, and the incident
I is worth wide consideration since it gives
i clear evidence of what may be accom
plished for reform if only the editors of
any locality combine to accomplish it.
For some time past Vallejo has been
' almost overrun by gamblers. The Vallejo
Times asserted in beginning a crusade
against the evil: "Vallejo is becoming
the Monte Carlo of California. Gambling
I h'-lls are doing business openly on Georgia
| street in violation of the State law, de
' bauching our youths and injuring the
{ business and fair name of the town." Oti
I that showing it called for a suppression
] of the evil and roused the officers of the
law against it.
The' Chronicle and the News joined
j heartily with the Times in making the
j fight, and the result was the accomplish
ment of a speedy victory under circum
stances whicu give promise that it will be
permanent. The Chronicle declared the
gambling in the city way not ordinary
gamins, but came within the full scope
and condition* of a menace to the com
munity, and the Newt gave an equally
hearty support to the fight.
Tbe result is clearly stated by the News
in a recent article, w ich says: "Now all
the game? which were openly conducted
in the saloon" on Georgia street are closed
and are likely to remain so." It adds
furthermore: "It is asserted Sheriff Rush
and District Attorney Devlin will see that
the games do not reopen."
The swift accomplishment of success in
this fight acainst gambling by the news
papers of Vallejo has a lesson for the
I newspapers of San Francisco. This City
j has lone been overrun by lottery fakers
and swindlers. The Call has repeatedly
directed attention to the fact and invited |
J the co-operation of its contemporaries in
j crushing out the evil. We now do so
| again.
Every lottery ticket is a swindle. Every
man who sells one not only violates the
law, but swindles the man who pur
\ chases it. Hucli swindlers and violators
| of the law should not be tolerated in any
I community, and it seems evident from
the result in Vallejo that if our contem
poraries would unite with us we could
| put an end to thii evil and save to the
j people of San Francisco many thousands
j of dollars every month.

DESTROYING THE WHITE SCALE.
Interesting Experiment in . m Southern
California Orchard.
' To the Editor of. the San Francisco Callâ Sib:
On Saturday Horticultural Commissioner
Hamilton of Orange received a strong colony
of verdalia ; cnrdlnalU from Commissioner
Scott of Los Angeles. Mr. Hamilton placed'
them in the old Travis orchard, where some
white sea. had been discovered. This is the
third time within the lust few years that this
orchard has been treated with parasites, and
each time they have apparently eradicated the
white scale. That the scale should again ap
pear proves two facts that horticulturists can
no: afford to overlook. The first is that the
greatest care and watchfulness is necessary at
all times, not only to restrain diseases or pests
which are known to exist, but to prevent the
recurrence of those which have apparently
been eradicated, and by all means to stop the
importation of new ones. â¢ The second fact
proved is that the white scale 1s held in perfect
subjection by the vedalia.cardinalis. : Ihe use
of one insect to destroy; another is a complete
success, and every effort, should be made to
further apply the same principle. ;

MUSIC AND MUSICIANS,
Since the publication of Mme. Nordica's
asperity at not getting the roles she wanted at
the Metropolitan Opera-house this season it
has been intimated that her marriage lies
heavy on her mind. As the famous Maine
widow her disposition was always sunny, aud
her temper was as harmonious as her voice.
But they say strange things about Herr
Donne, the young Hungarian tenor whom
Kordica vowed to love, honor and obey, less
than a year ago. He is a good deal younger
than she is, he is ambitious, and he seems to
lack the talent to shine in the same company
with his wife. Last summer Nordica had a
paiuful experience with her Dueme. A Ger
man audience positively refused to listen to
s singing and his name was about to be re
moved from the programme, when Kordica
said if he went she would go, too. Rather
than lose her Coslma Wagner finally accepted
her spouse, but the Incident must have been
wounding to Nordica's pride. Having closed
the doors of the Metropolitan Opera-house to
herself Xordica has se: out on a concert tour,
which will extend to San Francisco if the olive

Be Far From Happy.
branch is not held out bytJrau and accepted
by Noroica. She is very foolish to have quar
reled with Gran, for to close ihe doors of the
Metropolitan to herself means to close the
doors of Covent Gnrdcn also. Paris does not
want her and Germany scarcely offers a wide
enough field for an ambitious prima donna
with a husband to support.u pport.
What the French pÃpers speak of as "a re
gretable incident" happened recently atOran.
It seems that the music and dramatic critic of
oneot the local papers, L'Echo d'Oran, gave
quite the reverie of satisfaction to tfce gingers
of the Municipal Theater troupe. Indeed, the
barytone and the tenor were to inluriated at
nis Btrictures of their vocal efforts that they
laid a deep plot for revenge. One night the
critic was decoyed into the dressing-room of
Fouquernie, the tenor, Rodeville, the lary
tone, being also present. No sooner was the
unfortunate scribe inside than an unexpected
flank movement from Fouquernie cut off his
retreat. According to the telegraphic reports
the tenor "paralysed the critic's movements."
while the barytone, vrno seems to have been
of a more aggressive nature, subjected the
scribe to kicks and blows. French justice is
swift; as soon as help came the tenor and the
barytone were taken before the Commits&lre
di Service, and the verbal process having es
tablished beyond a doubt their malice Afore
thought, Messieurs foquernie and Rodeville
were commlt'.ed.
Mapleson only promises one new opera this
season, although Italy is flooded with new
works. Heseems to have made his one selec
tion wisely, however, for "Andrea Chenier"
figures in the repertoire of almost all the big
Italian o^era-houses fur the coming season,
and wherever it has been ulayea It has made
a success. The work is by Umberto Giordani,
who, like Mascagni, Leoncavallo, Puccini and
the rest of the composers of "Young Italy,"
came to the front quite rapidly. Giordano, in
fact, is the newest of tl.em all, but there are
others whom Mapleson might have found it to
his interest to give a hearing in AmericaâPuc
cini for instance, who Verdi says Is the most
itifted of them all. The big opera-house of San
Carlo at Naples has just announced the lollow
| ing works for the coming season: "Pource
augnac," an unpublished opera by Alberto
Frunchetti, "Cristoforo Colombo,'' by the tame
composer, Verdi's "Falstaff," Puccini's "Ma
non Lescaut" and Giordano's "Andrea
Chenier."
When Susan Strong, the Brooklyn society
girl, made her debut with Maplesou's opera
company not long ago, as Marguerite in
"Faust," she was so unnerved by stage fright
that she could scarcely sing at all. Later on
she, regained her self-possession and showed
herself to be the possessor of a beautiful voice,
though she could not act. It is said that the
flower show which was interpolated into the
performance on Miss Strong's account had
never been equaled on a metropolitan stajce.
One box party alone contributed some fifty
bouquets.
Quite an excitement has been stirred up in
musical circles in Paris by the sensational con
ducting of Alexander Winogradsky, president
of one of the branches of the Imperial Russian
Symphony Society and director of the conser
vatory of Kiev. This is how Le Figaro de
scribes his method of handling the baton:
"When one recalls the delirious parodies of
chefs d'orchestre formerly clayed by the Han
lon-Lees one will have some idea ot the spec
tacle presented by M. Winogradsky, panto
miming with his arms, feet and head with ail
the fantastic agility of a down. A simple
orchestral score becomes, through the furious
ardor of this disjointed interpreter, a terrible
drama or a good fnrce. But the power of talent
and conviction is such that this frenzy of
gestures, which at first seems ridiculous and
raises a smile, soon imposed respect und atten
tion."
Alexandre Gnllmant has just been appointed
professor of the organ at the Paris conserva
tory in place of Widor. The appointment
gives great satisfaction, as he is one of the best
men who could possibly have been chosen for
the post. It was he who represented the
French school at the World's Fair, and some
of the best organists in this and other conn
tries are his pupils. Guiimanj was born at
Boulogne-Sur-Mer fifty-nine years ago. For
some years past he has been the organist of La
Trinite, and both as a composer and organ
virtuoso he is universally known.
The Filodramatico Theater at Milan has JuÂ«t
Riven the firÂ»t performance of a little opera
entitled "Dopo lAve Maria" (after the Aye
Mari:<). the music of which is due to a young
composer who bears the promising name of
Alfred Doniiettl. The opera won a prize in
the recent Steiner competition and is very
highly spoicen of, but it could not save the
theater, which was in financial difficulties,
and two days afier its production the manage
ment of the Filodramatico had to close the
doors of the theater.
The French Minister of Public Instruction
and Fine Arts has commissioned Albert Carre
to make a tour of the chief opera-houses in
Germany, Austria, Hungary, Russia and Italy
in order to bring back to Paris all the sugges
tions for improvements be can find. The first
theater to which he was commissioned to
direct his steps was the Ducal Opera-bouse of
Carlsruhe, wnere "Drac," the new lyric drama
by the Hillemacher brothers, was being per
formed.
A writer in Le Menestrel, advocating the
Wngnerian idea of an invisible orchestra,
says: "It is possible that in a certain number
of years the souvenir ot the visible orchestra
of our days will produce tho effect on future
gent-rations that is produced on us when we
read of the performances in the days of Lully,
I Corneille, Racine and Moliere, when the stage
' was incumbered on both sides by spectators
sitting among the actors."
All the operas of the defunct Carlos Gomes j
are to be presented this season at the Lyric
Theater ot Rio Janeiro, including "Maria !
Tudor," which is as yet unknown in Brazil.
A bill is before the Brazilian Parliament for
a subrention of $10,000 to defray the cost of
the series, and it includes the obligation of
two representations for the profit of the fam
ily of Gomes.
The Liederkranzâ the German singing so
cietyâof New York will celebrate its fiftieth
anniversary in 1897 by making an artisiic
tournee of Germany and Auitria. The pro
ceeds nl all its concerts will be devoted to the
poor of the town where the concert is given.
The Royal Theater of Munich has just re
vived with real success Chabrier's "Gweudo
iine," which met with a very chilling recep
tion when it was first given some years ago.
It is another case of a French composer having
to die before his work is really appreciated.
Vincent d'lndy's new lyric drama "Fervaal"
will be produced in Paris about the middle of
January. The composer is actively superin
tending the rehearsals.
The lolloping programme will be performed
at the orchestral concert at the Baldwin
Theater next Sunday evening, when Mme.
Fannie Bloomfleld-Z.-isler will play with the
Hinrlchf-Beoi orchestra: Overture, "Pro
mcthurs" (Beethoven); concerto in F minor
(Chopin), Mme. Zeisler; ballet music, "Gia
conda" (Ponchlelh); concerto in D minor
(Rubinstein). Mme. Zeisler; scherzo from D
minor, concerto (Litoif), Mme. Zeisler; Spanish
tlauce (Mosykowski).
The third Bacon-Minetti ensemble concert
will take place at the Association auditorium
on Saturday afternoon at 3 o'clock.
INFANT'S SHORT DRESS.
A graceful model is here shown, which
hangs straight from a rourd yoke. The sieeves
are the comfortable and stylish bishop shape.
Deep flouncing is used for dressy gowns, and
if no; too heavily embroidered make nice
dresses for general wear, embroidering of
simple patterns wearing better than heavy
ones. The savine of labor in the finish at the
foot is nlso on object to folks who make these
garments at home.
Embroidered flouncing of plain colored
ginghams are pretty if white grows monoto
nous.
For white cambric dresses yokes of white
fabrics that come already tucked are labor
saving and prettier than plain fabrics. The
ruffle around the yoke on such simple gowns
is of the fabric, with perhaps an edge of nar
row lac? or embroidery.
Where exquisitely dainty frocks are desired
nainsook or batiste is used. A band em
broidery of tbe snme fabric, win the pattern
forming a straight edge thai is open, is used
in lieu of neck and sleeve bands. This is put
on with a French seam, making a neat finish.
The King of Belgium is now erecting two
villas at Beaulieu. Ills expected that Queen
Marie Henriette will pass next winter in one

RUSHING WORK AT
MISSION WHARVES
All Classes of Vessels Are
Represented There at
Present.
Return of the Wrecker Whitelaw
From the Remains of the
San Benito.
The Compasses Were in Perfect Order
aud the Vessel Was Well
Fqu pped.
The busiest scene at the water front is
to be found at JVlission-stieet wharf. All
classes of vessels are there. Tbe big ship
from Australia is unloading coal, the
whaler is being refitted, the scow schooner
is unloading and the American ship is
taking in a general cargo for New York.
Steam schooners can be seen loading and
unloading and all in all Mission 1 and 2
presents the busiest scene on the front.
The Norwegian bark Stjorn and the
British ship Travancore are both alongside
Kosenfeid's tounkerÃ. The whaling bark
Cali ornia is being fitted out for a South
Sea island cruise, the McNear is almost
loaded with lumber for Australia and the
scow schooner I'iute is taking in a general
cargo. Several steam schooners and small
craft are in the intermediate spaces and
la consequence Wharfinger Short is more
than busy.
The wrecker Whitelaw got in from the
remains of the San Benito yesterday.
All she brought back was the steamer's
chronometer, -her compasses, the signal
lights, the steering wheel, the signal gun
and all the small stuff that could be saved.
"In all her life the Wbitelaw never
bucked into a heavier gaie than she en
countered when on her way to Point
Arena," said Chief Engineer Collins yes
terday. "We bad a terrible time of it and
yet the wrecker logged her eight and
seven-eighths knots an hour right along.
When we got to Point Arena the wreck
was breaking up and all we could do was
to s>ive anything that the waves had I
spared. When thÂ« gale came up again we I
had to put to sea again and came right
back to San Francisco. The San Benito,
cargo and all, will be a total loss."
"The San iienito's compasses are now
aboard the wrecker," said Captain White
law. "There are seven of them and every
one is in as good condition as those of the
City of Peking, and the latter vessel got
in from China yesterday. The chronome
ter is also aboard the Whitelaw and it is
in perfect order. W r e only had a cursory
v:ew of the wreck, but judging the stuff
we saved she was one of th best formed
vessels that sailed through the Golden
Gate. She was better equipped than any
collier I have ever seen and that is saying
a good deal. G.ve the devil his due and
say from me that on any other collier in
the same circumstances the chances are
thai tbe loss of life would have been
twenty-six instead of six."
When the second gale came up the
Whitelaw had to run for San Francisco.
It was lucky she cot in as soon as she did.
because at 5:30 p. m. it was blowing 6G
knots an hour, while at tlie heads the
Hydrographic Office recorded 56 knots an
hour. The San Benito was fitted with Sir
William Thompson's patent deep-sea
sounder, and it was saved from the
wreck. With otner sounders the ship has
to be hove to in order to make a sound
ing, but with the new invention an obser- j
vation can be made when the vessel is at
full speed. Crossing the bar Captain
Whitelaw tested the new contrivance and
found that he could gauge the depth of
water on the bar while the Whitelaw was
going full speed.
Tne schooner Amethyst got in yester
day, and the cautain reports having
passed a water-logged and dismasted
schooner on the 21st inst. off Cape Blanco.
It was blowing hard at the time and a
very heavy sea was running, so the crew
of the Amethyst could not lower a boat.
The schooner Joseph and Henry was very
close to tne wreck at the time, and the
chances are tbat when she reaches port
some more definite information about the
derelict may be obtained.
Mrs. Thorold, owner of the tug Ethel
and Marion, and the captain of the little
vessel had quite an altercation yesterday.
The master of the vessel made a remark
which the owner resented, and she went
for him with her umbrella. Tue skipper
raced up the wharf and Mrs. Thorold
after him, and it was only when Officer
Henneberry put in an appearance tbat the
chase ceased. A new master will go out
on the Ethel and Marion to-day.
The new steamer for the Hawaiian
inter-island trade was not built by Mat
thew Turner but Dy Hall Bros, oi Puget
Sound. She is a splendid vessel and one
of the best of her class, and has more
than fulfilled the expectations of her
builders. She was called the James Spiers
in order t<> rill the requirements of the
California law, but when she reaches
Honolulu her name will be changed to
Mauna Loa.
The schooner Challenger, seventeen
days from Seattle, put in last Tuesday
night leaking and had to be run on the
mud flats. She was in coliison with a
steam sciiooner outside the heads, but as
a heavy sea was running and a gale blow
ing Captain Sovernd could not make out
his antagonist. People on 'Chance think
it was the Alice Blanchard bound north
that did the damage.
'I he schooner Cnarles Hanson was on
fortunate during the run from Grays
Harbor. On the 19th inst. Mate Gregoli
â on cave an order to jibe the mainsail.
He went to the assistance of the men and
bis foot caught in a loop of the rope.
With a jerk the sail tightened the tackle
and the "eg was broken like a pipe siem.
The disabled man was put aboard the
lightship Columbine and landed at Ho
quiam for medical treatment. The next
day Seaman Lane was washed overboard
from the Hanson and never seen again.
HAVE RESUMED BUSINESS.
The Well-Known Firm of Jamel M.
Mortn & Co. Opens lip Again.
Friends and customers of the well
known dry-goods firm of James M. Moran
& Co. will be glad to learn that they have
j-assed through their financial embarrass
ment. Having settled with all their cred
itors Moran & Co. have resumed business
and are rapiiiiy coming to the front again.
Owing to tbe {ireat success of their sale
and the noble manner in whicn their
friends and patrons flocked to their as
sistance they were enabled in a very short
space of time to realize sufficient funds to
make satisfactory settlements with their
creditors and resume business with an
entirely new stock of the latest styles in
foreign and domestic dry goods. A great
advantage to have an entirely new stock,
particularly so at the very low prices prp
vailinc at present, Moran & Co. liave al
ways kept good faith with the buying pub
lic, no misrepresentation of their goods
being allowed either in tbnir advertise
ments or by salesmen. The width,
we. gin, quality and price are always found
to be just as represented. Tins policy
Moran & Co. intend to continue, whatever
may be the result.

COLLINS EXONERATED.
A Jury Finds That He Did Not Caxise
the Death of Mrs. Crow
ley.
John Collins, charged with the murder
of Margaret Crowley, was acquitted in
Judge Wallace's court yesterday. After
the testimony for the prosecution was all
in Collins' attorney stated to the court
that none of tbe witnesses had been able
to connect his client with the death of
Mrs. Crowley , and as the corpus delicti
had not been proven he asked that the
jury be instructed to acquit.
In order to strengthen this position
Collins was put or. the witness-stan J, and
told a straight story of the alleged assault
on Mrs. -Crowley. He admitted that he
slapped the face of Mrs. Crowley's daugh
ter, and that when Mrs. Crowley ap
proached him he put up his open hand to
wa:d her off, and that she fell to the floor,
but denied that he used any violence.
The autopsy disclosed the fact that the
woman died of peritonitis several days
later, and medical experts gave it as their
opinion that peritonitis could not have
been superinduced by Mrs. Crowley's
fall, as it had been described by the wit
nesses.
Deputy District Attorney Hinkle said he
found it impossible to connect Collins
with the death of Mrs. Crowley, and asked
the court to instruct the jury to render a
verdict of not guilty, which was done, and
Collins waiked irom the courtroom a free
man.
RAILROADS MUST REPORT.
Tbe Interstate Commerce Commission
After a iierellct Corporation.
The officials composing the Interstate
Commerce Commission are evidently not
of the material that will stand nonsense
or interference with their official duties.
Under an amendment to the law setting
forth the duties of that bedy is one that it
shall present an annual report to the
authorities in Washington, D. C, a state
ment of the working and business of every
railroad in the United States. In order to
do so the commission is obliged to call
upon every railroad company lor a report
containing the desired information.
To this end the commission has pre
pared blanks for reports to be filled in by
the companies, which are required to
state the amount of the busni3ss trans
acted, names of officers, stockholders,
shares of stock and by whom held, bonds,
relations to other lines, leased lines, etc.
All of these reports should have been
filed with the commission by September 15
last, but the Bellingham Bay and British
Columbia Railroad Company (head office
in this City) has neglected, failed or re
fused to do so up to the present time.
Tbe case was laid before the United
States Attorney, and yesterday morning
Assistant Attorney knight presented the
case to Judge McKenna of the United
States Circuit Court in the shape of a
petition for a writ of mandamus to com
pel the derelict company to comply with
the law and furnish the commission with
a report. Judge McKenna ordered the
issuance of an alternate writ which he
made returnable on December 4.

APTO FIRST AT
ODDS OF 100 TO 1
Little Johnny Woods Rode
the Long Shot in
Winner.
Billy Vice, at 50 to 1, Sauntered
Past the Wire in
Front.
Hymn Was Left at the Post Again.
Principle Defeated Osric II
With Ease.
Whew! but there waÃ some merry,
rollicking racing at Oakland yesterday.
With Billy Vice, a 50 to 1 outsider, finish
ing abead of BernardiUo, a 3 to 5 chance;!
Apto, with odds of 100 to 1 chalked against j
him and running loose, winning, and j
Hymn, a 4 to 5 favorite, left at "the post, i
little wonderment can be expressed that j
the talent saw visions of fat roast Thanks
giving turkey and cranberry sauce and
mince pies "like we got down on the
farm" vanishing in the distance. Any
body tbat can take that charming trip
across the bay and beat the races at Oak
land with the acrobatic fprru displayed by
the horses has assuredly missed his voca
tion, for he should hire a loftroom in
some smokehouse in Chinatown and de
vote his entire attention to marking lot
tery tickets for the heathen C.'wnee.
A good-sized crowd nssembled to do
homage to the sport, and the success they
met with can b â¢ gathered by a fleeting i
glance at the form charts. The first
choices were all easily subdued and
beaten. What the heavy track did not
accomplish Mr. Ferguson completed
owing to circumstances over wh.cli he
had no control.
The performance of the 100 to 1 shot
Apto takes rank over all the other acts.
The Baldwin entry started a couple of
days back and displayed about as much !
speed as a sawhor.-e straddled by a tramp
with a bologna sausage as a bat. H
started in the fourth event over seven fur
long<, with Johnny Woods, a featner
weight and eighty pounds, in (be saddle
and, taking the lead before quarter of a
mile bad been traveled, won under
double-reefed sails from Scimitar, *ho
opened favorite. Draught, the favorite,
backed by the Watson boys, was third.
Another happening that set the wise set
agog was the clever victory of Billy Vice,
with the short price of 60 to 1 against his
name. He outfooted the 3to 5 choice,
BernardiHo through the stretch, passing
the wire a length to the pood, riddea by
the Montano "Garrison" Gol ten.
Gold Boy, tne 9 to 20 favorite for the

FARMERS PAY
TOO MUCH TAX
Professor Plehn Assails
the American Revenue
System.
Explains His Obj=ctioD at the
Convention of County â¢
Assessors.
Many Changes in State Laws Recom
mended at the Sacramento
Conference.
,v
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Nov. 25.â A1l day
long the County Assessors of California
have been endeavoring to solve the many
knotty problems -which are continually
cropping up as the discussion on revision
of certain sections of the code governing
tbeir duties is entered upon more fuliy.
Shortly after the convention reconvened
this morning the committee on revision
returned to the committee of the whole
and asked a general discussion on section
3831. which provides that the Assessor is
liable for the taxes not collected, unless
they are illegal, invalid or void.
Barharn of Tehama wisJied this act to
be made more liberal, citing the instance
of ships that must be assessed in San
Francisco, where registered, but which
leave before assessments can be collected.
He did not want the section repented, as
the draft of a new section would virtually
mean.
King of Fan Luis Obispo said that the
Jaw could not make a man do an impossi
bility. It was his opinion that the sec
tion was unconstitutional in regard to the
limitation of defense. Equalizer Beamer
spoke against the rerieai.
He said it would not do to take away
the responsibility of Assessors. Oriman
of San Joaquin said he felt as did Mr.
Beamer.
King again spoke on the question of ex
tending the defense. He also wished
more time in which the.Â«e taxes could be
paid in on account of the trouble con
nected with the collection.
Beamer stated that this was not a hard
ship on the Assessor. It was hi< excu?e
lor collecting in all cases; it was a oenetit
rather than a hardship. Nuner of Cala
veras sided with Beamer. This was also
the view of Snitzer of Santa Clara.
The motion in favor of repealing the
section was put and lost. A motion to
reter back to the committee, with a recom
mendation to extend the time until the
Ist of October and alsd extend the defense,
was also lost.
When the question as to the power of
Assessors to assess snowsheds, etc., along
railroads was called up it was found
that it had not been submitted to
The Board of Equalisation ollicially.
Beamer stated that he was of
the opinion that they were not
assessed by the board, and that they
should be assessed by the Assessors. It
wax the duty of the Assessor io assess
railroad fences in their respective coun
ti<>s. As lor sbowshe'ds they were a su
perstructure, and as the Board of â¬ Equali
sation assessed all substructures and su
perstructures the Assessors had nothing
whatever to do with them. The conven
tion accepted the answer of Beamer.
King of San Luis Obispo presented a
resolution to the effect that it be declared
the sense of the convetion tbat the State
Board of Equalization be empowered to
raise or lower the assessment of different
cias-es of property in equalizing between
counties and that the be submitted
to the people as a propo:ed constitutional
amendment.
At the present time the equalizers can
make only a horizontal raise or reduction
of all property in the county, although
personal property alone maybe assessed
too low, while real estate may be as-
Bessed at the proper value. The proposi
tion was referred to a committee.
Gibson of Tulare wanted a constitu
tional amendment exempting $250 of per
sonal property from taxation. This was
voted down.
Vincent of Fresno wished the word
"fraudulent" stricken out of section 429.
The motion to suggest the change was
carried.
Carl Plehn, professor of political econ*
omy at the State University, was called
upon to address the convention and said:
1 did not come here to address, but to listen,
and this gives roe a chance to thank the con
vention for their courtesy. I have learned
jnore by this discission oi the practical work
ing of the revenue laws of the State than 1
could by years of careful study.
I understand you bare come together to get
Ihe present system into working order rather
than chance the conditions Almost all writ
ers on the subject of general property iax
claim we nave the -worst system ot any civil
ized country, the objections resting upon prin
ciples that under!;.- the whole tax system.
'In- general theory is that ench person is
accorded a. benefit commensurate t<> ttie prep
erty lie owns. Under the protection of the
Government a man is able to carry on his
rccupation, yet if he invests his sav
ings iÂ» certain property lie pays no
tax. for property has become iarsrely
intangible. It i.s impossible'at the present time
to arrive as ihc true value of many kinds of
property. It is impossible to hsscss a news
paper, for instance. The presses and build
ings might be assessed, bin the real thing, the
newspaper itse f. could not be. We separate
property from the owners, making it not the
owner, respoimb.e for the tax, and, by this
rneens place a clond upon its title. In theory
we do not know but that the article we pnr
< iiHs â¢ in a store may have a lieu upon it, tiled
by the Tax Collector.
But when it comes to real estate the real
periousuess of ibe tyatem is apparent. As
Assessors you ennnot teli how much personal
property in yc.ir cooaUej escapes tax
ation, k very large proportion does un
doubtedly escape, and this for tiie rea
son that it is so easily hidden from
view. Yon would assess it if you could fina
it, but you cannot find v. Tin- ilnnk Commis
sioners are able to find a Rreat deal more prop
erty on the Ist of March^helonping to the
banks than you are ablÂ«s to Ijnd a few months
later. The result of this is that taxation is
unequal. He who does not conceal his prop
erty pays the tax of him who does.
The farmer is the greatest sufferer, naying a
great deal more la proportion to nil real
â wealth than does thÂ« property-owner in the
city. The burden which the farmer is carving
Js tremendous and the time is coming when,
this must change.
The farmer cannot stand this for rII time,
and it is '.o the advantage of the Government
that the mailer be speedily remedied. I shall
welcome the day wncu our entire system is
changed and we rane our revenue through In
come taxes, corporation taxes and special taxes
on insurance companies and banks.
At the conclusion of the address the
committee on revision gave notice that
its report, was read. On motion the con
vention voted to hear the report. It recom
mended that section iW'AO ba repealed.
This relates to visiting every house in the
'listrict la making up the heldboot. The
recommendation was adopted. Action

THE SA^ FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 26. 1896.
SCALP OF ISIDOR JACOBS
SMOKES IN THE WIGWAM
He Voted for McKiniey and Daringly Boasted of His
Treason by the Council Fire of the
Iroquois Braves.
Convicted of Charges of Dis
loyalty and He Will Ba
Expelled.
WOULD BE KUINED BY BRYAN.
AJI That Wculi Be Left for Him Wou!
Ba to Commit Suicide, Sail
a Witness.
Rank treason of the gamiest, rankest
and most ancient kind has invaded the
wigwam of the Iroquois braves.
One of the braves actually trampled An
drew Jackson. Â£lax Popper, William Jen
nings Bryan and Sam Rainey underfoot
by not only parading in the big Repub
lican procession on October .'SO, but by go
ing to the polls on November 3 and de
liberately voting for the McKiniey and
Hobart electors. Judging from the rea
sons given by him in justification of this
act of high treason, it must be inferred
tbat the unfaithful brave also voted for a
Republican Congressman and for a Re
publican representative from San Fran
cisco to the State Legislature.
He was not only guilty of this deed, but
he did more. When he placed the red
cross of his approval opposite the names
oi the Presidential electors of his choice
he was in the solitude of the election
booth, and no human eye witnessed the
foul deed when ho stabbed his party to the
heart with the red rubber stamp.
Then, when he had folded his ballot and
the officer of election had smilingly de
posited it in the box with the final word
"voted," the happy Iroquois braves stand
ing by never dreamed tliat one of their
mightiest sachems had smitten tnem in
the neck with a Republican club.
No one would have known anything at
all about it had not Isidor Jacobs, the
recreant brave alluded to, uplifted his
melodious bazoo and publicly proclaimed
his shame.
It was on the first meeting of the Iro
| quois Club after the election cyclone, and
i the red man's moon was dark, the date
being Friday, November 13, when Mr.
Jacobs stood at the door of the wigwam,
and as the Draves w Te passing in he sang
a war song, taunting them because their
faces were long and their "carts were had.
"Ha! lia!' lie cried, defiantly. "I voted
for McKiniey and Hobart, and I'm proud
of it. I'd do it again if 1 got the chance.
I glory in it."
Among the bic chiefs whose sorrow was
outraged by those treasonable words were
Dr. J. Gordon. Samuel McKee, David
Pn.tt and Tnomas J. McÃride.
Dr. Gordon at the next meeting pre- i
f erred a formal complaint against Jacobs,
charging him with conduct unbecoming a
member of the Iroquois Club. A commit
tee of investigation, headed by Judge A.
D. Lemon and Max Popper, was appointed j
to investigate the charge and to report to
the club at its next meeting.
The committee went into session last
Tuesday night in the law offices of Arthur j
E. Mack, in the Marye building, and ex- c
aniined several witnesses. At the conclu
sion of the investigation ttie committee j
decided to recommend the expulsion of
Mr. .Jacob-, on finding the charges to be
well founded.
The lirst witness was Dr. D. J. Gordon.
He saw Isidor Jacobs nt the door of ibo
Wigwam on the night of the last meeting,
and heard Jacobs make the assertion that
lie (Jacobs) had voted for the McKiniey i
and Hobart electors.
"He said something about the Chicago j
platform," continued Dr. Gordon, ."but I
didn't pay any further attention to what
ho said. I K ot all that 1 wanted there,
after Â»ie said that he voted for the Me-
Kinley electors. Jacobs said that if hs
had it to do again, and if it were the same
platform and under the same conditions,
he would support the Republican electors,
provided the Democrats indorseed
the stiver plank in the platform. I heard
that Mr. Jacobs marched in the Republi
can parade, but I didn't see him."
Samuel McK.ee, the next witness, was
present on the same occasion and gave
similar evidence. After Jacobs hmJ made
his shameless declaration ho added that
hÂ« was proud that he had voted for Me-
Kinley and would do so a vain if neces
sary. When the question was put to him
by friends whether he was not sorry for
what he had done he replied that he was
proud of it an. l would do it again. He de
clared that he would not apologize for
what he had done and would not make
I any apology at all. Jacobs declared that
I he was opposed to the Chicago platform
| and would nor support the candidates, and
I he started in to criticize and find fault
| with them.
In defense of his conduct Jacobs told
the witness at the time that Mr. Bryan,
the Democratiecandidate, had on a former
occasion voted for Weaver, who was not
at that time a Democrat running on the
Democratic ticket.
David Pratt, another witness, told of
Jacobs saying that at lirst he was in
| clined to vote for Palmer and Buckner.
j Then he said that he did not wish to put
in half a vote and that he voted for Mc-
Kiniey.
"Was Mr. Jacobs at that time a member
in good standing of the Iroquois Club?"
asked Max Popper.
"I don't think he was," replied Mr.
j Pratt. "He owed more than $L' so on the
' books."
Abraham Jacobs, a relative of the ac
! eased, told about a conversation he lÂ»ad
had with Isidor on the street corner. Isi
dor said that if he voted for Bryan he
would be ruined; that he had received
I dispatches from England from persons
I who wanted to buy his business, and that
, if McKiniey should fail of election he,
i Jacobs, would be a ruined man. and that
i all that would be left for him to do would
De to commit suicide.
Thomas J. McÃride corroborated the
! statement of the previous witnesses.

Sail End of the Son of the Man After
Whom Angela Camp Was

In the death notices which appeared in

Charles C. Angel, aged 34 years. The man
was the son of the well-known miner after
whom Angels .Camp is named, and who
at one time could count his wealth far up
in the thousands. But bis wealth slipped
through his fingers, and when he died he
was a poor man.
His sons fared no better, and this one

Romantic Career of Major
Mills, a Visiting Globe-
Trotter.
The Recipient of Medals From
the Queen for Bravery at
Kandahar.
The So'dier a Money Spender, the Like
of Which Is Illustrated by Find

Writteu in a plain way on the register
of the Occidental Hotel and with nothing
to indicate anytning oat of the ordinary
routine are the names of H. L. Mills and
Mrs. Mills, Manchester, England. Be
hind thia simple registration, however,
lies a remarkable story of love and for
tune the like of which is seldom heard.
Mr. Mills, or rather Troop Sergeant-
Major Mills, was, until recently, a soldier
for many years in the British army, serv
ing in India, South Africa and other
countries. He fought bravely during
many bloody engagements, and though
his promotion was slow it came at last
whep he won fame at Charasai, Kabul
and Kandahar.
For his heroism in these terrific engage
ments the British Government bestowed
medals upon hitn, for one of which many
a man in England would be glad to give
$10,000. But while the soldier was far
from home and lisking his life for glory a
relative died. The young soldier had no

fortune. One of his relutives was vastly
wealthy and about to die, but two nearer,
twin were between him and this wealth.
But while he was in the wilds of India i
unknown to him all three of the relatives !
passed away. Some time afterward the
soldier was notified of this and a fortnne
of about $4,000,000 was to be divided be- ;
tween him and his sister. The news came
as a sudden surprise. The soldier had en- j
listed for a lows period. But it was not
dillicu't under the circumstances to pur
chase his discharge, and accordingly thia j
was yoon arranged. When it was done he !
set off on his long journey to England to I
claim bis fortune.
When he got there, too. it was speedily j
bestowed en him. The soldier who had!
dragged himself forward wearily on many
n marc!) had at last got such a fortune as
he had never before been able even to hope
for. But when he hail got his great for- â¢
tune he remembered that in the days be
fora he became a soldier he had an old !
sweetheart. This sweetheart was, when j
he knew her, living in a little suburb of
his native town of Manchester. Thither
the newly created millionaire went. He
soon met the cirl of his choice. She had I
remained unmarried. There was a speeny !
ringing of the Â»vedding bell?, and the !
happy bride and groom set out on a tour '
ot the world.
This was six months aÂ»o. Since then
they have been in all the countries of the
Orient where the erstwhile unknown
soldier fought. Now they are here to *cc
California and other parts of the coast
and thpv will then go East. Sergeant-
Major Mills is of a merry disposition and
he kept things lively on the Alameda
while en route. Wine flowed in abund
ance, and the gallant soldier's helpmeet
was quicker, if possible, tnan himself in
opening the bottles of champagne. On
the Alameda was a young boy named
Fred, who is said to be n brother of the
assistant postmaster of Brooklyn, N. Y.
The boy hod pot in hard luck in Japan
and Nat Goodwin gave him a job as a
snpe. He wanted to come bact to Amer
ica, but having no money he could not
pay his f:tre. It was finally arranged, how
ever, that he should come as a waiter and

should especially wait on the members of
Nat Goodwin's company.
On board the young fellow made friends
with Millionaire MiilsÂ«, and now the latter
L* going to take him along to New York to
look aftei^his luggaae.
"I can do thai anil can stake him to a
few pounds without missing it," said the
millionaire. 'In this way the boy will
pet back home."
Sergeant-Major Mills spoke yesterday of
his strange career. He is a very young
looking man, but says he served twenty
three and a half years in ihe British army.
"I enlisted when I was but 16," he said.
"I served three years in England, one in
India, three in South Africa and five in
Ireland. While in Imtia I served with
Ceneral Huberts, now Lord Robert*, who
is a greater soldier than N.ipoleon. I went
with him in 1850 as troop sergeant-niojor
on his siaff in the ereat march from Kabul
to Kandahar of 395 miles which was made
in twenty-three days. For this I received
the bronzed star inscribed, 'From Kabul
to Kandahar, iHSO,' for which many a man
would pive thousands of pounds.'
The other medal, on one side of which
is the bust of the Queen, hangs below
three bars, on which are inscribed "Chara
sai. Kabul, Kandahar."
The soldier and his bride will probably
be here but a. few days. They visited
Chinatown a night or two ago with some
friends, and t: c generous millionaire, it is
said, spent about Â£50 to smooth the path
way of the crowd. He bears the reputa
tion of beine as generous as a miner who
has after many years finally struck a great
bonanza.
THE ROWING REGATTA.
Exciting Boat Kaces to Be Held at
A lamed a Mole To-Usy.
Most of the prominent and expert oars
men in the State will participate- in the
e;reat regatta that is to take place at Ala
meda to-day.
The first race will start promptly at
10:15 a. m., and all those wishing to see
it should take the 9:43 narrow-gauge boat
for Alameda.
The entry list, published exclusively in
Tjik Call of yesterday, is a large one.
A large number of elegant and costly
prizes have been offered and will be the
means of creating some lively finishes.
President Humphrey of the Pacific
Athletic Association has made an objec
tion to the race for Otd Timers and the
Naval Reserve taking place under tne
auspicfis of their association, as they are
professionals, his association only counte
nancing amateur sport.
Chairman Pembroke in answer to the
remarks of President Humphrey said:
"I wish to state that so lar as the Naval
Reserve and the Old Timers' race is con
cerned, they are separate and distinct from
the races held under the auspices ot the
A. A. A. They will row on the same
water and on the same day, but that has
nothin? to do with the association.
"If the association wants to draw the
line of amateurs so very closely it should
be applied to every oarsman in San Fran
cisco, for a great many received free
transportation to Stockton, and those races
were held under the auspices of the asso
ciation.
' From the talk I have heard in refer
ence to the Old Timers' race a person
would imagine tbat instead of being old
time oarsmen they are old-time criminals.
I don't hold them as such, as they are all
members of the various boat clubs.
"The objection to them at this iate day
is rather strange and I should say not well
taken. They will row. however, and will
not contaminate the officials of the asso
ciation."
LOOTED A SALOON.
A Burglar Visits the Exchange at 14
Third Street and Carries off
the Cash.
The Exchange Saloon at 14 Third street
was visited by a burglar early yesterday
morning while an arc electric light burned
inside and another equally brilliant lamp
illuminated the exterior. Despite the
bright lights and the transparent glass
panels of tne door he managed to go about
his business unseen and to empty the
cash register of all it contained in money.
The burglar was apparently content
with what loose coin he could find, for he
did not touch either cigars or liquor. Nor
was the safe molested, not as much as a
scratch could be seen on it.
An examination of the premises com
menced. A. Becker, one of The proprie
tors, found thar the thief had secreted
himself in the toilet-room and after tne
saloon was closed at 2:15 a. m. robbed the
cash register and walked off. The booty
amounted to $16, which had been left in
the cash drawer. Marks of the burglar's
shoes were traced from the toilet-room to
the sidewalk. He tried to take off the
lock of the front door, but failing in this
opened the top and bottom sliding bolts
and tben pushed the swinging doors open.
Mr. Becker said he was convinced that
the thief waa familiar with the place.
Some time ago a key was missed from the
door leading to the basement and it was
found in the front door lock after the bur
glar left. From this it was inferred that
the thiei had stolen the key with the in
tention of robbing the saloon. He under
stood how to "beat" the cash register, for
he opened it without ringing the bell by
pressing gently on the key till the drawer
sprang out. The thief was not a safe
cracker, as he did not try his hand upon
the safe, which stands in an obscure
corner.

'. â¢ A history of the case goes back to April 1

â¢from this port to San Diego, sprung a leak
."a^'d began to take in water fast. Captain
Alexander was unable to check the flow

run for Port Harford, where he beached

empt by law from all responsibility and
not -constrained to pay damages.
The substance of Judge Morrow's dcci
â ' sion is as follows:
." it does not appear from the testimony that
â¢the vessel alter she left tne port of San'Fran
ciscb met with any accident or injury which
.would cause a leak. She does not itppear to
â  have struck or come in contact with any
rocjts or other object until she was beached at
Pjort Harford. Neither does it appear that
she encountered such boisterous weather as
would account for an opening in her side to
which the leak could â be attributed. The
testimony does not directly indicate any neg
ligence on the part of the officers or crew in
navigating the vessel, but it does seem to
point to an open deadlight as the cause of the
leak in the water-tight department. After the
vessel had been beached at Port Harford, and
while she was partially under water, a diver â 
;Was sent down to examine her bottom and as
certain what was wrong with the vessel. He
went down several times, and appears to have
stopped the leak, for after his final examina
tion all the bulkhead doors were secured from
the inside, a cofferdam was built around the
forward hatch, the water was pumped out and
the vessel floated. Forty-eight hours after
ward.she nad returned to San Francisco with
out any ieak occurring on the voyage to that
port.
Upon the whole of the case lam of the
opinion that the libelants have made out their
case within the rules of the law against the
"claimant, and that the latter has failed t<l
bring himself within any of the exceptions
provided by the shipping receipts or contracts
of affreightments whicn would relieve him
from liability for .the damages sustained to trie
various shipments made on board the steamer
Queen. . _ ... ... . .
Let a decree be entered in favor of libelants
and let the case be referred to the Commis
sioner to ascertain the damages suffered by
. such shipment, unless the parties can reach
some understanding and agreement respect
ing the amount of damages to be awarded.
PHILBROOK'S NEW MOVE.
' .He Has Filed a Petition Which Attacks
". â¢ the Supreme Court.
1. Horace W. Phil brooK has prepared for
..fiUng a petition in the Supreme Court
â¢.that the two decisions tiled November 5,
â  :IS9S. in the case of Ira P. Raukin as ad
â â â  Hunistrator of the estate of John Levin
. -son, deceased, against William J. New
â â maii and Benjamin Newman, be vacated.
' --^Ir. Phil brook opened his petition with
.a' request "that the case be heard and de
.â¢â  ciued in accordance with the constitution
and the law and the dictates of truth and
â¢justice." He then proceeded to state the
'grounds of his request. The first of these
â was that there was no decision or judg
ment-having the concurrence of four Jus
: tlces, while the constitution provided
that the concurrence of lour Justices
' present at th c argument should be neces
â¢ safy to prouounce a judgment in bank.
./The two decisions were made in bank.
One decision declared that the artic es of
" â¢ partnership authorized a sale of the dead
'.. partn r's intere.-t to the surviving part
ners and the other dc-clared that the arti
â¢â¢-eles did not authorize a sale and that the
' .sale "was unauthorized and void." Mr.
.Fhilbroofc therefore claimed that there
...was no concurrence of lour Justices, thn c
, -..having decidt-d one v. - ay and three having
â¢ . 'decided the other on this point.
'.Mr. Pbilbrook's second alletiation was"
':that the case was ordered submitted in
of the statutes. Mr. Ran Kin
. never-having been required by the adverse
. -.â¢party to appoint anotner attorney or hay
. .ing' appeared in person. The third was
â -" tbat, under the constitution, there could
â¢".be no decision in bank against a party
â¢ 'without hrst allowing him tne right
f^eelj" to argue the case in open court."
M.r. Pnilbrook reiterated the charges
.'which he had previously made concerning
.] lirs disbarment by the Justices and averred
that "when the case was at last cailo l on
' -August 14, 1895. neither Mr. Kankin nor
' any one representing hire, was in court
and* the cause was ordered submitted
without a word Â«poKen for or by the plain
tiff. The plaintiff never submitted the
ca-se for decision."
â¢Another reason -.iven for granting the
petition wiis that the two decisions filed
â¢ -.November 5, 1896, were void becau-e not
made Within ninety days after the sub
mission of the case. It was not decided
' for seven months sifter the case was trans
ferred to bant. There were many other
reasons alleged, and many pages in which
shasp mention v/as made concerning
Ralph V. Harrison, now Justice Harrison,
and also concerning the other Justices.
Mr. Philbrook said also that tho brief
â¢ which tfiÂ« Supreme Court described as
"Mr..Philbrook's tirade" was not his brief,
but was Ira P. Rankin's as administrator,
and that when it was filed he (Philbrook)
-was held under disbarment and was not
allowed to file any brief.
Dead and Unknown.

Union.
Success Has Attended the Efforts of
the S.ate Organize to Augment
Membership.
During the present week the Women's
Christian Temoerance Union has been
holding a series of meetings in this City.
Yesterday two meetings were held at 132
McAllister street. One of these was the
County board meeting and the other was
the meeting of the Central Union, which
was attended by representatives of all the
local unions in the County. Mrs. H. H.
Luse, tiieCountv president, and Mrs. Hen
rietta Skelton were present. A leading
subject of discussion was the coming of
Miss Frances Willaru, who is expected to
visit and work in California during the
coming winter.
Mrs. Henrietta Skelton also made a re
port concerning her work in this County,
where she has met with much success in
the matter of augmenting the member
ship of the local unions. Two meetings
were held on Sunday, which were well at-
tended â one at the Zion M. E. Church and
one at the West bide Christian Churcn.
Meetings were held Monday in the Hamil
ton-square Baptist Church and the Eng
ghsh Lutheran Church, and on Tuesday
in the First Presbyterian Church, the Cal
vary Presbyterian Church and the .foweil
stre'et M. E. Church.
Mrs. Skelton has been recently working
in Lasseh, Modoc, Pmoias and Sierra
counties. From here she will probably go
to Colusa and Glenn counties and later
will pursue the work of organization in
Buite and San Luis Obispo counties. Dur
ing the past year much labor has been ex
pended in twelve counties in the northern
put of the Stale, namely: Siskiyou,
Shasta, Sacramento, San Francisco, Ala
meda, Sonoma, Monterey, Santa Cruz, San
Benito, Amador, Calaveras and San
Joaquin counties, and a le-s amount of
work was performed in Southern Cali
fornia.
The president of the State organization
urged the prosecution of the work in ihe
line of increasing membership at the last
State convention, urging that increased
membership meansan increase of strength,
and that to secure this increase lecturers
and organizers must ba kept in the field.
Ail the workers in the Women's Christian
Temperance Union work are in excellent
spirits concerning the outlook for larger
local unions in many counties.
ALL FOR REPAVEMENT.
Meeting of Property-Ownm to Con
sider the Improvement of Post, Geary
and >tockton Streets.
A call for a meeting of property-owners
wag issued several days ago by the Mer
chants' Association to consider the ad
visability of having certain downtown
blocks, now paved with cobbles, repaved
with a more modern material. The call
was addressed to property-owners on Post
street, lrora ' Montgomery to Stockton,
upon Ge*ary street, from KÂ»arny to Powell,
and upon Stockton street, from Market
to Butter.
In pursuance of this call the following
property-owners were present yesterday
in Assembly Hall, Mills building: James
D. Phelan, F. W. Hinckley. A. M. Davis,
Joseph Figel, O. D. Baldwin, Mrs. S. Mish
C. W. Welch, J. F. Ortmann. Charles
Schroih, Charles Kornneld, S. L. Sacbs
W. J. Somers, S. P. Kimber, C. A. Beh
low, S. Clayburgh, Marlon Leaventritt
and E. Peterson, representing the Shiels
estate; Colonel E. A. Denicke, represent
ing the Mechanics' Institute; and P. W.
Ames, representing the Spring Valley
Water Works. Certain other property
owners along these blocks were repre
! sented. W. H. H. Hart, F. H. \Vocds ana
I F. A. Hihn, property-owners, communi
| cated their willingness to join in the
movement.
A communication from the Market
street Railway Company, addressed to O.
D. Baldwin, was read, stating that the
company had abandoned its tracks on
Stockton street and would remove the
rails.
The meeting was organized by the elec
tion of F. W. Dohrmann, president of the
Merchants' Association, as the perma
nent chairman. In takine the chair Mr.
Dohrmann stat d that the object of the
meeting was the improvement of the pave
ments of the downtown streets now paved
with cobbles. He stated that at the last
meeting of ihe Board of Supervisors a
resoiuticn was adopted that the board wilJ
agree to pay one-half the expense of the
repaying of these blocks, provided the
property-owners paid the other half. A
message was also received from the clerk
of the Board ot Supervisors that the City
would probably pay three-quarters of the
expense of the repavement of the street
fronting City property.
A general discussion then ensued, snow
ing the great desirability of having these
blocks repaved. Mayor-elect Phelan
stated he believed the work should be
undertaken at once and other speakers
present joined him in showing their will
) ingness to have the work done. After a
further discussion of the subject by
Messrs. A. S. Baldwin, O. D. Baldwin,
Marion Leaventritt, Colonel E. A. Denicke
and Andrew M. Davir-, the meeting decided
favorably to the proposition of having the
work done at once.
The chairman of the meeting was then
I unanimously requested to appoint a com
mittee consisting of two property-owners
in each block to solicit the names of other
property-owners to the agreement. The
chairman stated that tha appointment of
the committees would be made as soon as
it could be determined what property-own
ers in each block would be willing to serve
upon the committee. Undoubtedly the
committees will be appointed within a few
days.
Before the meeting closed the chairman
stated that there was no preference for any
special kind of pavem nt or in favor of
any contractor. The entire object of the
Merchants' Association in calling the
meeting was simply to initiate the move
ment for the improvement of these blocks.
The meeting then adjourned subject to
the cail of tne chair.

The Grand Jury After the
Lottery and Faro
Players.
Downtown Pool-Sellers on Horse
Races Are Also Under
Consideration.
Police C' mmissioners and Chif f Crow
ley Suggest Methods to Pre>
vent the Evil.
The Grand Jury was in special session
yesterday to consider matters pertaining
to the Police Department.
The gambling phase was taken up to
the exclusion of everything else, and
Chief Crowley as well as the Police Com
missioners were called upon to say why
the City ordinances were not enforced.
The grand jurors, backed by the knowl
edge they had gained by personal obser
vation, asked the Commissioners and the
Chief how it was that lotteries, both
among the whites and the Chinese, were
running day and night; how it was that
faro banks were accessible to whoever
cared to play, and how it was that pool
rooms for the sale of tickets ou races were
open in the City.
Chief Crowley explained that his men
had instructions to make arrests in all the
cases mentioned, and thai they had done
so repeatedly.
The fault of the entire system, according
to the Chief, is that the Police Uourta do
not impose tines heavy enough to
deter others from committing the same
offense.
Lottery-ticket venders, the Chief stated,
could only be fined a limit o> $50, whereas
the maximum should be sufficiently large
to be a punishment. Heavy tines should
be inflicted on men found with lottery
tickets in their pockets, and faro-bank
dealers, who are now permuted to go at
large with a tine of $200, should be mulcted
to the extent of $1000, while the players
should be fined $250, instead of only $20.
The jury accepted the suggestions and
propose to incorporate them in a recom
mendation to ba properly presented to the
next Legislature.
REFRIGERATOR CARS.
Xhe 1 ailro:t<i Commissioners and the
southern Pacific May Clash Again
About Jurisdiction.
The Board of State Railroad Commis
sioners met yesterday in its office in this
City. Commissioners Stanton and La
Rue were present.
Little business was transacted, the two
Commissioners confining themselves to
an inspection o: the proof sheets of their
report to Governor Budd. No changes of
importance were made in the report, but
refrigerator cars were discussed in an in
formal way. In the report there is a reso
lution adopted by the last Legislature
calling for an investigation into these cars,
and the Commission decided yesterday to
prepare a supplemental report on refriger
ator cars regarding its jurisdiction or
powers over them.
The Southern Pacific Company holds
that the Railroad Commission has no con
trol over those cars, as they are employed
in interstate business, and there is no need
for refrigerator cars in local traffic
throughout California. Upon this ground
any attempt to regalate rales on refriger
ators will likely be contested in the courts
should the commission decide that it ha&
control.
FOLSOM-STREET LINE.
The Electric-Cars Will toon Ban Oat to
â¢Army Street.
. A . delegation from the Precita Valley !
Improvement Club held a conference yes
terday with General Manager Viniug of
the Market-street railway system. The
club made application for an improve
ment in the â¢â  streetcar service between
! their neighoorhood and the business part
of town.
At present the Mission-street electric
line has a branch running through Precita
Valley on Twenty-ninth street, but the
improvement club is desirous of having
connection made with the Folsoni-street
! system, which taps another territory.
The committee laid its proposition before
Mr. Vining.
- The result, however, was not quite satis
factory to the delegation, though the rail
way manager stated he would extend the
Folsom-slreet electric line to Army street.
"Beyond that point," he said, "there is a
hill, the grade of which is too sleep for
electric-cars to be run over. Beside-,
there is not enough beyond Army street
to justify extending the line for the
present."

A STIFF LGATUKK MAKKET.
The Shoe nnd Leather Review of Chicago says:
The tanners are buying carefully nnd sparingly,
but desiiite their beat ifTVrts the Quotations for
hides will continue to mout.t upward. The mar
ket while strong and ndvnncinK is not character
ised by feverish buying. Although some selections
of packer hides have advanced 76 per cent in
twelve weeks no blame attaches to tanners. They
have bought only as hides were absolutely needed
to keep the liquors from going to waste. The rise
In values is not in any degree the result of specu
lation or even competitive buying. If the
past twelve weens were to be gone over
again it is difllcult to see how the re
eult could be different. Natural conditions
liavc served to boom hides and the tanners have no
recourse but to accept the inevitable, and, as far
at In their power, mark up tue price of leather.
Therrjarket for country hides is less excited, but
there is no disposition to nhate prices. The spurt
In the quotatious curly in the week was caused by
several buyers com|>etinK for the scanty holdings
of the desired (selections. It is understood the
dealers are paying high prices in the country for
buffs, and the* next sales will either beat higher
rates than are now quoted or a considerable loss
will ensue. The supply of upper leather hides is
limited, and dpipite hI! the efforts of buyers,
values have risen steadily.

Explanation.
The arrow flies with the wind. Tne top flgnrâ
at station indicate maximum temperaturÂ« for the
days; those underneath It, if any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in Inches and hundredth*,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect poln s of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word â¢â¢hieh" means hlirh larometrlc pressure aiM
is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and .is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high in the Interior
and low along the coast, and the Isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" Is Inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse ot these condition*
till produce an opposite result.

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, â¢ 111., Nov. 25 âThe bulls were In
harness again this morning and wheat prices made
a remarkable gain. The advance was established
over night and was in recognition of an Improve
ment of 3Vid at Liverpool. Holders were heavy
sellers at the opening, the profits shown at the
ruling quotations having an alluring appearance.
Many '-stop" loss orders we're passed on the bulge,
and I the filling of these afforded prices sustaining
power against tae heavy selling. Receipts In the
Northwest wera very lieht at 445 cars, against 806
last Wednesday aud 754 a year ago.
Chicago had but 37 cars and inspected out 88,
-460 bushel.", closing Liverpool catties reported a
slight loss from tne opening. Continental markets
were not very firm Paris quoting declines and
Berlin giving but % mark advance. Antwerp
was uncbauged. Export clearances were liberal
at 648,883 bushels. May wheat opened from 84c
toÃ3V4c,sold between 84c and 82% c. closing at
83Vic bid, 1 i/4@l%c higner than yesterday. Es
timated receipts lor Friday 25 cars. No. 2 red
spot wheat changed from 89V 3 c to 91Â»/ic, closing
about 89% cto 91c. . . .'/ . ..'
CORWâ vVas firm without displaying any of the
buoyancy which was a feature of the leading grain.
Privileges on corn sold at very close range last
nixbt, and any movement either upward or down
ward was met with the opposition incident to trad
ing against them. Moreover there was no belief
In the stability of any boom which might take
place, hence the ' speculative caution. Receipts
were 167 cars, ami â¢ 344,174 bushels were taken
from storage. Liverpool cables were Vid higher.
Exports were exceedingly heavy at 1,053.413
bushels. May corn opened at 27s/ B e. sold between

cars.
OATSâ Were not endowed with anything worthy
of attention or mention. Buslneis was local and
very light. Firmness In the tone was due to Ihe
strength prevailing In the othe- markets. Re
ceipts were 14a cars, and 63,060 bushels were
taken from storage. Exports were 285,590 bush
els. May oats, closed V*c higher. Ks lmaled re

POULTRYâ OnIy about 60 tons of dressed Tur
keys came In yesterday, but to the surprise of
everybody the market broke. Everything was In
favor of high prices. The â¢ weather was clear and
cold and nlockn small and the forenoon prices were
18(g(20c. but In the afternoon all offerings were ne
glected and quotations dropped .to lÂ£@lÃc, most
of the sales being at 17c. The reason for this break {
. will be a revelation to most people. It is that the
pubic will no- longer pay over â  20c for their
Thanksgiving Turkey. The retailers found this
out yesterday when they paid 20c wholesale and
tried to get 25c retail. The public stopped short
ana prices had to give way.
A car of Eastern will be offered to-day.

How the Juniors Will Help
the National C. E.
Convention.
G. E Gilbert Proposes a P.an
That the Young People
Gladly Accept.
By Growing and Selling Produce Thou
sands of Dollars Will Prob
ably Bs Made.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Nov. 25. j
A novel plan has been brought forward
for enabling the thousands of Junior
Christian tndeavorers oi the State to add
their mite to the general fund for the
National convention of 1897. For several
months complaint has been made that the
C E. GILBERT, Who Will Give Seeds to Junior Endeavorers to
Raise Plants Which They Will Sell for the '97 National
Convention Fond.
juniors are taking little or no interest in
the great, event next year. It was urged
on their behalf that they had no money
\o give and that consequently they could
not enter into the spirit of the affair.
This objection, however, exists no longer.
C. E. Gilbert of the city Endeavor Union,
,who is one of the most prominent men in
the organization in this county, was sur
prised at tue last meeting of juniors to
hear the little ones express a willingness
to work or do anything if by such action
' they could help to swell the fund for enter
taininz delegates at the next convention.
. A- aiscussion was held, but no feasible
â¢plan was advanced which would bring
a-boiu the desired end. Finally, Mr. Gil
bert thought that the little ones, if they
were in earnest, wouid be willing to do a
little gardening to testify to their love for
â¢the principles of the union.
Mr. Gilbert advanced the idea that if
they were to grow plants and vegetables
" and sell them for the benefit of the fund,
it would be far better than to advise them
.logo around begging from their friends.
The' idea at once proved acceptable, and
the' little people signified their willingness
to grow produce it it were made possible
for them to do so. Gilbert then under
took to supply every child with the neces
sary seed to start a little produce- patch.
- At the next meeting of the juniors a
large variety of garden-seed wi 1 be on
â¢ hand and the children will be given what i
kuid they desire. They will also bfc toid j
how best to cultivate them and wtat to do j
: in order to render the experiment a suc
cess. Armed with seed and knowledge,
each little Endeavorcr will do his or her
beat to make a Rood showing when the
time comes for them to make known the
result of their efforts.
â¢ There are probably not less than a j
â¢thousand Junior Eudeavorers in Alamed*
County, and it is more than likely tliat
each one will earn from one to three dol- j
Jars by means of this experiment. The I
children are very enthusiastic over the !
wore and are erateful to Mr. Gi bsrt, not '
so much for supplying the s eds as devis- j

A GUN IS MISSING.

Oakland Office San Francisco Tali,,)
903 Broadway, Nov. 25, 1396. j
A very remarkable discovery was made
to-day in regard to the evidenca in the
trial of Antone Devencenzi for the alleged
murder of Felice Varnia last December.
The prosecution in the case depends to
home extent upon the proof that the
empty shells found near the murdered
' man's body were of the same kind and
size as those used by the prisoner with Jus
gun. This eun. has now disappeared, and
there is very little hope that it will be
recovered. .'
Three months ago Mrs. Burean, the pro
prietress of a guustore on Seventh street,
applied to the -District Attorn Ar-, for per
mission to take away and cian Deven
â¢oenzi's .gun to prevent" it Jrora.. .being
ruined. The permission was granted her,
bat before doing so the District Attorney
Â«>e # rved her wiUi a subpena requiring her
to" appear in court -'at the trial and bring
the gun with her. The trial is now on.
add tie prosecution has reached that stage
where it is necessary that it have the gun.
'Mrs. Burgan was called as ; a witness but
d.id not respond, and it was found that she
had Jeft town. . . . -' â¢ . * ;
'A search was made for the missing wit

the store has not the gun in his possession

him.
An attachment was issued to-day for
Mrs. Burgan and Sheriff White left with
it for Cloverdale. Without this gun all
j the evidence regarding the shells, which
hacl been very carefully worked up and en
which the prosecution depended to clinch
its case, w\ll be comparatively worthless.
Whether the gun has been intentionally

Leaders of Golden Gate Society Have
Ceased Quarreling.
OAKLAND, Cal., Not. 25 âThe trouble
over the celebrated Dillingham ball dress
that stirred to its center the society of
Golden Gate has been adjusted.
Speaking in her own behalf, Miss Min
nie Riley, who wore the dress and won
the prize, said to-day:
"I wish to say that Mrs. Dillingham did
not prepare the dress that won the first
prize at the masquerade on Saturday
evening especially for that occasion, it
being one she bad worn without success
on many previous occasions.
"Nobody asked her for the use of her
dress, but she offered it of her own free
will. She was not sick at the time, but
prelerred a good night's sleep to going to
the ball. If 1 had not worn the dress it
would not have been there to win the
prize.
"Afterward she wanted the whote prize,
but on second consideration has come to
my terms of agreement and given me half
its value, and she is now in possession of
both watch and dress, and all is settled
satisfactorily to both."

BERKELEY, Cal., Nov. 25.â Another
scene in the famous trouble over the dis
puted possession of the Townsend prop
erty on Shattuck avenue was enacted to
day. All the accessories for a first-class
tragedy were present â two pistols, a de
termined woman, an aggressor and an

audience of a score or more people which
bad gathered around the "Townsend
Fort," as it has come to be called.
The spilling of blood by the shooting
ing down of Berkeley's Town Marshal was
only averted by the coolness of temper
which the officer displayed and the fear
lessness which he manifested toward the
enraged woman. As told before, the town
authorities had authorized Street Superin
tendent Chick to remove from the street
the house of Mrs. TownÂ«end, which has
been blockading the public highway for
more than two weeks. Chick was driven
from t c premises.
YesterJay Mm. Townsend was told that
her dwelling mu-t be moved back to its
place at once, a-. d that unless she had it
done to-day the matter would be attended
to by the town authorities.
Instead of comnlying with the request
of tho Street Superintendent she re
enforced her stock of ammunition and
said she would shoot the first man who
laid hands on the building.
Superintendent Chick held a lone con
ference with her this morning in an at
tempt to persuade her that she should

efforts were unavailing, and accordingly
this afternoon an Oakland contractor, ac
companied by Marshal Lloyd, went to the
house.
Mrs. Townsend was on guard inside
with two trusty revolvers and n great
quantity of ammunition. The mar>hal
rapped at the duor for admission. Tne
aged protectress of the citadel opened the
door, but on seeing the officer, attempted
to close it. The marshal then forced the
door open, and before he knew it Mrs.
Townsend had a six-shooter placed against
his chest and was attempting to pail the
trigger.
Her weak arms, for she is 76 years of age,
were closely pinioned, however, and she
did not succeed in discharging the weapoi;.
Officers Coey and Esmond jumped in at
this instant and wn-sted from the prny
haired matron the two revolvers which she
hPld in her bands. Having been disarmed
and placed nt the m* rcy of the
olticars. she was put under arrest and
charged with assauit with a deadly wea
pon, l^he was arrested under the com
pla nt which was sworn aeainsi her as a
result of her first trouble with Chick. A
plea of not guilty was entered, and she
Tvas allowed to go from the Town Hall on
her own recognizance. While she was
gone the house was moved back to its old
position.
Before work was commenced a repre
sentative of W. P. Grant, the house
mover who put the building in the street,
notified the Oakland contractor not to use
his outfit for moving.
Superintendent Chick ordered the Oak
land contractor to go ahead, saying that
he would confiscate Grant's outfit and
take it to the Town Hall, as it was an ob

struction to the street. All of the outfit
that was on the property claimed by the
town has been taken to the Town Hall.
To-night Mrs. Townsend is at the resi
dence oi Dr. Ritter, and says that she will
now pive up to the authorities, in the
hope that justice may be meted out to her.
A large number of Berkeley citizens
who know the history of the case say that
Mrs. Townsend has no just claim to the
property she is attempting to bold and
that the plea that she is a much-abused
woman is groundless. Others, however,
assert the contrary.
There seems to b6 no telling when or
how the matter will end.

GAME TO-DAY
Continued from Fifth Page.
part, but he is believed to be in good condition
now and fully capable of holding down his
end. He is speedy at getting down on kicks,
runs well with the dr. i and is. strong at tack
ling. The way he will slip through a mass of
interference and down a runner Is admirable.
His greatest fault is a tendency to overrun hi s
man, especially on punt.s. Jeffs is also catcher
on the Varsity baseball team and a good one.
Quarterback C. G. Murphy is theonlv fresh
man to make the team, and it is only through
his unusual ability that he won the coveted
place. Little Mclntosh, who played sub
quarter lasi year, was looked on as a sure
winner ot the place on account of his wonder
fully ijrttty end clever play, but Murphy was
too strong for him. United with unusual
speed. Murphy has a knack for punting that
easily places him ahead of Â»ny other player at
Stantord. For distances. Soper can, perhaps,
outpunt him, and Freeman is nearly his equal
in that respect, but neither is so accurate in
his placing of kicks nor so quick in executing
them. Murphy is sure in his passing and
tackies fairly well, but his strong point is his
cleverness us a general. He has what players
call a "football head," that is, he knows just
what to do in a game at the right time. His
football experience comes from two years'
play on the Willamette Co.lege team, during
one year of wbiob time Murphy was captain.
In Salem, WaHh., Murphy has a record as a
hurdler, jumper and bicyclist. He weighs
146 pounds, Is 5 feet Go Inches tall, and is
hiking Latin as a majjr Hludy. He is 20 years
of Rge.
Forrest 8. Fisher, Stanford's right half, is a
webfooter from Oregon, and this is hfs first
year in the Varsity. He began to play foot
ball toward the close oi lnsi year, and his
model build for a halfback, coupled with bis
weight, strength and >pirlt, made him a prom
ising man. For mu*cular development no
man in the team exceeds him. His play this
season bag been characterized by steadiness
and reliability rather than brilliancy. Pos
sessing no great speed or quickness in getting
off, Fisher d<;es manage to get up a pow
erful momentum in a very short distance,

that he rivals Frankenheimer of former years.
He also backs up a line well ana is a hard
tackier. Fisher is of st cky build, 5 feet 7
inches In his stockings, and weighs 176
pounds stripped. He entered Stanford wiih
i the class ol 96, and is pursuing the Btudy of
the law.
With H. F. Seawright at left half Stanford
well feels that she is strongly lortlfled. Sea
wright is a hard, dashing player, a steady,
sure tackier, and active on his fevt. He backs
well and is a srround-gainer with the ba 1.
Hiswei'ihtis 172 pounds, stripped, age 21,
height 5 feet 8'- 2 inches, and n;ajor subject
German. He is a post-graduate student, only
arrived at Stanford this year from Missouri,
and somewhere in that state his record for
the hundred yards is said to stand at 10 sec
ond* Hat.
Steuurt W. Cotton, the fullback, is frequent
ly said to be the best aii-roun-1 football piayer
at Stanford. He has tried all poduona now
Hnd is a success in any of them. Last year he
was a very likely candidate for quarter and
was tried lor some time in that position. Cot
ton learned the Ram: originally at Belmont
School and \va- the only freshman of the class
of '98 to m:iki- the tenm. This is his third
year on the Varsity and he thoroughly uiuier
stnnds the game. As a line-bacter nothing
can stop him, and at tackling he is sure and
Umd. Forsolaige a man Cotton has much
speed, which makes him valuable to send
iieaiust the line. Cotton is still the youngest
m >n In the team and has been ever since he
lirst played for Stnnford as Â« freshman. He is'
19 years old, is G feet 1 inch In height and
weighs 187 pounds, stripped. His major
study is history, and his home is in San Fran
cisco.
In case any of the men should be injured
there will be plenty of substitutes on hanu to
take their places. As a rule thesa substitutes
have given the Varsity men close runs for
their positions.
For "subs" buck of the line there is, first, C.
S. Dole 'i>B, of Kivertlde, Stanford's all-round
athlete ana coast champion poie-vaulter, who
had a lead lor a Varsity place until iniured
two wei'ks ngo. He is just back in playing
shupc again. As an en<i-iunner and for keep
ing his feet Dole is the best back at Stanford.
He Is a;so strong at line-buckinsj nml in back
ing up the line. His tackling is but little in
ferior to Seawright's. and his weight is the
same as that of the Varsity left half. Dole is
~*i years old. 5 feet *l inc-hes in height and is
taking economics as a major.
Louis Freeman '99. of Pasadena, the tennis
champion, is sub-half or fullback, and is but
18 years old. He is larger than anvof the
halfbacks and is (i feet in height, weighs 1761Â£

Freeman is a fierce line-bucker, fair tackier
and an excellent punter.

he makes up in spirit. He is in every play,
plays an excellent defensive game and is al
ways on hand in stopping up c mass play. At
finding a weak point in a line he has lew supt
riors and his tackling is low and hard. His
residence is Salinas, Cal.; his age 21; major
study, physiolopy.
W. W. Burnett '00 can play equally well
at guard, center or tackle. He was the center
rush in the freshman match against Berkeley
and had an easy time with Birdsad. His play
ing is better now than ever before. Law is his
major; bis height is 6 feet 1 inch; weight, 193

Edwin James '98, of Paso Robies, "sub
guard," is in prime condition and is capable
of a sturdy game. His practice this season has
been steady and conscientious. He is 6 feet 2
inches in height, weighs 190 pounds stripped
and is a civil engineering student.
Sub-end is W. L. McLaine '97. of San Fran

lollow the ball carefully and tackle in an ad

SuL-quarterback \V. P. Mclntosh '99, of Los

way and has mi-re endurance and grit than
most of the Varsity men. He is 21 years old,
but weighs only 135 pounds.

has been rubbed down, the final yell has
been given and the last song has been
sung before the mightily sinewed collegi
ans meet on the gridiron-like amphithea
ter in battle for the crown of laurel. Tne
long training season with its many vicissi
tudes, its inevitable vagaries, its hopes, its
fears and the anxiety it has occasioned in
thousands of hearts is at an end. Now a
few hours of rest for the men and the bat
tle will De on.
As a fitting climax to a season of hard
labor and incessant toil the friends and
supporters of the sturdy players who are
to uphold the blue and gold in to-mor
row's contest turned out GOO strong to
nignt and gave them an ovation such as
only college boys can give. They sang
and they yelleu, they hooted ami they
cheered, they spoke and listened. No
Caesar ever departed from Rome untier
more delightful and encouraging circum
stances. The "rooters" who had gathered
to pay tribute to ;ne defenders of Alma
Mater met at Stiles Hall for a lew mo
ments of practice in singing and cheering
before going in a body to the training
quarters.
Under the leadership of Yellmaster
Gooding and Assistant Miller they went
through the lines of football songs, the
iibesand the verses of doergerel which they
had committed and which will be dealt
out to Stanford to-morrow in quantities to
suit.
Coach Butterworth, Manager Reinhardt
and all the players were called out one by
one and asked to speak to the body of
yelling students, who Btood within the
j glare of an impromptu bonfire, which was
weil fed with boards and pickets from the
surrounding fences. Captain Ransome
thanked the boys for the ovation, ana ex
pressed full confidence in a victory for the
| blue and gold in to-morrow's contest. He
I said that all the men were going into tue
| game with one purpose â that of winningâ
I and il defeat should be their lot they
! would bear it bravely, feeling that they
had done their best. His remarks were
frequently interrupted by loud rounds of
applause. Each of the other members of
the team responded in a few well-chosen
i sentences.
But er worth was callfid for and when
the popuiar coach appeared cheers from
the tnrong fairly rent the air. He adraon
i isfaed the students to ever be loyal to the
! lootbali men, and especially tnose who
| bucceed in reaching the highest positions
which they nave won through merit. He
discouraeed the idea of cheering a player
who dashes out from the rest of his team
and runs diwn the field with the ball
without cansidering also the man or men
j whose work made the brilliant play pos
sible. Continuing, he said: "You don't
seem to know when to yell and to cheer.
Your intentions are undoubtedly good
enoueh, but you frequently was.c good
breath. If the team did not have lots of
sand and good sense you would have them
spoiled because ol your sometimes mis
placed cheering. [Some one calls out
"three cheers for the sand."]
"I am afraid," said Butterworth, "that
I will not have the pleasure of seeing yon
acain next year, but I shall not foreei you.
Wnatever pointers to my buccessor from
my experience with you I can give will be
freely offered."
When seen after the meeting Butter
worth said to a Call correspondent that
he was much more pleasea with the show
ing made by the men this year than last.
"Their allegiance to the principles of the
came has been closer," said he, "and they
have worked harder and truer. The
general standard of their play has gone
up. They have been handicapped eoriie
what by the vagaries of the season, but,
after all, we should have no kick coming,
lor most of the men are in goo i condition.
"While l shall not place myself on
record as pred.cting the outcome of the
game to-morrow, I will say that I am not
absolutely discouraged with the outlook
for the Berkel-y team. It will be with
great interest that I will watch the game."
The team will tzo over to the City in the
morning on the 10 o'clocK train, and will
be quartered at the Baldwin. The little
bear which will s<Â»rve as California's
mascot and "Spud" Murphy, his Keeper,
will aiso be on the train. Both young
bruin and Murphy will be gayly decked in
blue and fjold, and are destined to cut
quite a figure on the field before the
kick-off. In the evening after the game
the piayers will go to the Auditorium,
vrheie the university theater party is to
be given and the farce "In Kokopo'' pro
duced by student actors.
More Harbor Improvements.
OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 25.â Another
large improvement wiil soon be added to
those already existing in the uppr har
bor. The contract has just been let for
the construciion of another large ccal
bunker upon the wharf of the California
Development Company, above Alice
street br due. It will have a storage ca
pacity of 6000 lons of coal, and the plans
provide for the latest improved machinery

SAY HEBBARD ASSIGNED ALL
THE BANK CASES TO HIMSELF
Mute Witnesses Produced in Court to Prove That the
Superior Judge Appointed Sheehan
Receiver.
Records of the People's Home
Savings Bank Suits
Are Read.
THBEE PONDEROUS PACKAGES.
Thomas S. Williams Jr. Putting In
Evidence to Justify the Famous
Circular.
The name of Judge J. C. B. Hebbard,
Judge of Department 4 of the Superior
Court of the City and County of San
Francisco, was repeated a great many
times in Judge Daingeriield's department
of the Superior Court yesterday, for the
attorneys representing Thomas S. Wil
liams Jr., charged with libeling Judge
Hebbard, were reading from the records
in the People's Home Savings Bank suits
to prove justification of the things pub
lished against Judge Hebhard.
The basis of the indictment against ,
Williams and his associates is a circular j
denouncing Judge Hebbard. It was issued ;
just before the election at which Judge
Hebbard was a candidate for re-election,
and is entitled "An Appeal to Voters."
In order to prove the charges made in
the circular against Judge Hebbard the
attorneys for the defense declared that it i
was necessary to read the records in the '
extensive litigation which followed the
failure of the People's Home Savings
Bank.
The accusations, brie fly stated, were that
Judge Hebbard had shoun himself to be j
"an unfair and therefore unfit" person to j
receive the suffrages of the electors of the
City and County of San Francisco for a
position on the Superior Court bench;
that he had "appointed as receiver of the |
bank an incompetent, irresponsible politi- j
cal parasite in the person of John F. '
Sheehan, so that his friend Watt became j
the attorney and active manager of the I
bank" ; that though Judge Hebbard had at
first agreed to allow the old board of
directors of the bank to meet tor the pur- j
pose ot resigning, he changed his mind j
'Ibecaune the men of character selected by j
the depositors for the vacancies were not '
satisfactory to Hebbard's boÂ»om friend, I
the notorious James Alva Watt, who de- !
sired >o be the attorney nuii real manager i
of the bank."
Touching the matter of extravagance
and wasteful mismanagement the alleged j
libelous circular continues: "During the
B>even months following Watt so manipu- j
lated affairs as to secure control of a ma- |
jority of the bank's stock, when Hebbard j
graciously discharges the receiver and his j
bondsmen without a proper accounting to ;
the court. A board of directors selected ;
by Watt was then elected, and Sheehan i
and Watt continued in orhco as manager
and attorney respectively, and a blanket i
resolution was passed by the board ap- 1
proving the acts of the receiver. During I
the eight months of the illegal receiver*
ship the sum of $42,965 41 was disbursed.
Keceiver Sheehan and Attorney Watt each i
appropriated as his salary the sum of $.500 I
ptr month. In addition large sums were !
squandered in fees and junketing trips, j
No less an authority than the Attorney- I
General of the State has declared that the \
receiver was not legally entitled to one |
cent of compensation for such services. 1 '
The circular closed with a charge that I
Judge Hebbard, more than any one else, j
was responsible for the "scandalous mis
management of the bank since its f lilure." j
This was sienod by Thomas S. Williams i
Jr., E. T. Kendall, Georne B. Conanr,
Benjamin Lucey, A. L. Casavaw and F.
H. (jualman.
Attorney Crittenden Thornton produced
three ponderous packages of documents,
comprising the original records in three
ruses against the People's Home Savings
Bank, in all of which John P. Sbeenan
figured as receiver, unuer appointment by
Judge Hebbard, and in each case James
Alva Watt appeared as attorney, in some
instances representins both the receiver
and the bank.
One matter on which Attorney Thorn
ton laid great stress in his opening state
ment ior the defens? was that Judge
Hebbard, while presiding Judge oi the
Superior Court, had allotted to himseif all
the People's Home Savings Bank cases in
which there was a chance to appoint a
receiver, and that he invariab.y made
John F. Shoehan his appointee, with the
result that James Alva Watt at once be
came the recognized attorney in the case.
To prove this assertion the original in
dorsement on the complaints against the
bank was read to the jury. In each case
the indorsement was the same, appearing
in Judge Hebbard's handwriting, as fo.
-lows:
: Assigned to Department No. 4. :
HEBBARD. â 
: Presiding Judge. â 
Judge Hebbard then was and still is
Judge of D?partment 4 of the Superior
Court.
â¢ After the alignment followed the ap
pointment of Watt as attorney for Shee
han, and after Watt had secured the elec
tion of a board of directors to suit his pur
poses Watt was, by order of Judge Heb
bard, substituted as attorney for the bank,
against the wishes of the former attorneys
of the bank, giving him a double grip on
tlio affairs of that institution.
It 1 oked at nrst as if Mr. Thornton and
his associates had taken a contract to read
for a month, and it, vould have occui ied
that length of time ii all the papers bad
been gonb through with, but by stipula
tion it was agreed that only papers bear
ing directly on the employment of John
F. Sheehan and James Aiva Wntt in the
patronage immediately un.ler Judge lleb
bard's control should be read. This con
tracted the job to ?uch an extent that the
reading was conf hided yesterday at nooii-
To sustain thu point ma<ie in the alleged
libelous circular that Judge Hebbard dis
charged Receiver Sh.ehan without requir
ing a proper accounting to the court the
record was read showing that the dis
charge and exoneration of bondsmen had
been allowed and ordered by Judge Heb
bard because Mr. Sheehan tiad filed in
court a receipt signed by the president of
the People's Home Savinps Bank to tbe
effect that he had turned over all the
property in his hands to the officers of the
bank, a list of the aforesaid property be
ing returnsd to the officers of the bank by
Mr. Sheehan.
The taking of testimony was continued
till next Monday, as none of the attorneys
wished to spoil the digestion of their tur
key by going on with a case so bitterly
contested immediately after Thanksgiving
day.
STRUCK IN COURT.
James Mcl'iulilen Sent to .Tall for Five
f iJays by Judge- black.
James McFadden startled Judge Slack
yesterday afternoon, and 'â - rive minutes
later be was himself startled by finding
himself in jail, where he will remain for
Jive days. He may regret that he has ao
opportunity to eat his Thanksgiving Day
turicey at home, but that is his own fault.
The divorce suit of Nellie L. Goidon
aeainst Levi B. Gordon had jnst been con
cluded, and Judge Slack awarded a decree
of divorce in favor ot the wife on the
ground of failure to provide.
In order to make as much defense as
possible Gordon, who is serving a term in
the County Jail for petty larceny, had
himself conducted to the courtroom by a
Deputy Sheriff. In his testimony Gordon
cast some slurs on his wife, and McFad
den, Mrs. Gordon's brother, was seen to
scowl angrily.
As Gordon was passing from the room
in charge of the officer McFadden, who
was in the courtroom near the door, sprang
upon him and struck him with his fist.
Immediately McFad.len was arrested and
was led back to Judge Slack, who ad
judged him guilty of contempt of court
and sentenced him to serve five days in
the County. Tail; so Gordon and McFad
den slept under the same roof last night.
IS NOW A SERVANT,
Mrs. M rl.emiHii 'i rw.l i-ii All Her Wealth
Into the liunde of a
Schemer.
The clouds are fathering around Michael
T. Ward's chances for liberty. He is now
serving a term for petty larceny in the
House of Correction, and when he will be
liberated in January next it will only be
to stand trial on the more serious charge
of grand larceny.
Mr-. Elizabeth McLennan is the com
plaining witness in this case.
The police have been aware for some
time that Ward had feloniously obtained
considerable money from the woman, bat
her whereabouts were uncertain. She was
discovered a short time ago in Lake
County, where as a servant she has been
working in a summer resort for $15 a
month. She was brought to this City,
where she swore out a warrant for Ward's
arrest.
A few years ago Ward made the ac
quaintance of Mrs. McLennan in Oregon.
She was possessed of $HOOO in cash and
property, the latter being located princi
pally around I'asndena. "Ward won the
woman's confidence and confided to her
the secret of an inheritance of $100,000 he
had just receivpd*.
As he proposed to go East to settle up
his affairs he turned over his power of

believed she could well represent him on
this coast.
Prior to leaving, however, Ward advised
Mrs. McLennan to place her property in
terests in the hands of a friend he had in
Los Angeles. To do this the deeds of her
properties were iirst turned over to Ward,
who in the course of time, the woman
says, turned them into ensh, leaving her
destitute and obliged to earn her living by
working as a servant.

IN TROUBLE AGAIN.
Chita Jackson or the Eugeno Ware
Murder Mystery Charged
"With Forgery.
Emma Cleverley, who was known as the
mysterious 'Chita Jackson, the woman
last seen with Eugene Ware, the clerk
who was murdered in the drugstore at
the corner or Hayes and Market streets
about three years ago, has been figurine
in the Police Courts on two occasions
within the past week.
Richard Brewer, a saloon-keeper, first
caused her arrest on a charge of obtaining
$250 from him by. false representation?.
The case was to have come up before
Judge Joachimsen yesterday morning, but
while the defendant was waiting for At
torney J. J. Coffey, for the prosecution, to
present the case, Brewer swore to another
warrant charging her with forgery. Upon
this warrant she was rearrested and again
sent to jail en bonds of $2000. Being re
leased, she again presented herself before
the coin t and through Walter Gallagher
she demanded an Immediate hearing.
Biewer refused to allow I'rosecuting
Attorney Dare to go ahead with the case
and as Attorney J. J. Coffey still remained
absent a continuance of a week was
granted. The court look occasion to
censure the delinquent attorney and took
underadvi?ement the suggestion of'Prose
j cuting Attorney Dare to declare him in
j contempt.
- The alleged forgery is the signing of the
woman's name as an indorsement on a
$600 eh* ck on the Anglo-California Bank.
She claims that the drawer of the check,
one Tillman, gave ,'ier the paper, and she
turned it over to Brewer for money he had
paid her from time to time.
JUDGE CAMPBELL'S WRATH.
He Score* Clerk T. B. O'Brien for Not
Being In Attendance.
T. B. O'Brien, clerk la Jndge Campbell's
court, was not present when the court
opened, and as he had the keys of the
desk where the records are kept the cases
on the calendar could not be heard.
The Judge gave vent to his anger in a
denunciation of O'Brien and remarked
that "he was probably off on a snree."
The court was adjourned until the after
noon in the hope that the clerk would
turn up.
At 2 o'clock the clerk had not made his
appearance, but a key was procured that
fitted the lock in the de^k and tho busi
ness of the court was proceeded with, a
deputy clerk being procured.
It was said that O'Brien was suffering
from a severe cold, which accounted for
his absence.

FOR CLOSING THE
MISSION GRAMMAR
The Board of Education
Criticizes the Health
Board.
Superintendent Babcock Is Very
Greatly Wrought
Up.
A Committee Will M-et With the
Health Board To- Morrow to
Discuss the Matter.
The meeting of the Board of Education
held last evening was largely employed in
criticising the Board of Health for its
action in having closed the Mission Gram
mar School and threatening to close the
Marshall Primary aad the Everett Gram
mar.
Superintendent Babcock gave the cue
for the attack. He said the Mission
Grammur had been closed for the reason
that diphtheria was prevalent in the
school. He saul that this reason was
based on two cases, one of which had not
been in the school since the 221 of Octo
ber and the other had never been iv the
school.
He then went on with a harangue
against the Board of Health, instancing
the closing of the Irving schools because
the sewage from some private tenements
emptied into the school lot, while neglect
ing for ten months to fix tne source. He
said the Board of Health exercised the
privilege of giving orders and physic to
the public, and the puoiic took the medi
cine, but vhen it came to a point where
that board undertook to run the schools
he thought it time to call a halt.
Dr. Clinton expressed surprise and re
gret at hearing the Superintendent criti
cize the best Board of Health this City
ever had. He declared that the Health
Board has done nothing more than its
duty. That board was created to look
after the health of the City and nothing
was more important to that end than to
see that the schools were ir good sanitary
condition. When they found a school
that was not so it was their duty to
promptly close it and keep it closed until
the Board of Education made it tit to be
opened.
"President Scott stated that ho had re
ceived notice from the secretary of the
Board of Education only tlint same morn
ing; that he had answered it tbÃt it
would have been impossible for him to
call the board together earlier than the
regular meeting that nigtit. He said he
agreed with the Superintendent, that the
Hoard of Heiith owed the Board of Edu
cation some courtesy in the matter.
Superintendent Babcock s:iid there was
mily one board whose business it was to
run the schools and when it came to any
other board trying to run them he ob
jected. He moved thai the Board of
Health be required to state in detail what
repairs were necessary in the three schuo.s
named as being in an unsanitary condi
tion. This passed.
Dr. Soper reported that he had just come
from a meeting of the Board oi Health,
where he had been given very little satis
faction. It had been suggested, he said,
that a committee from the B>ard of Edu
cation meet with the BoÂ»ra of Health on
Friday morning.
This suggestion was acted upon, and
Drs. Clinton and fcoier were named as
such committee.
Henderson and McElroy entered the
discussion from opposite points of view.
Henderson, while declaring that the
Board of Health had transgressed beyond
Us authority, still favored immediate
action to get the schools in good form.
McElroy said such speed would put the
bonrd at a disadvantage in the matter of
the price of lumber.
Henderson laid it was ridiculous for a
board that had insisted on paying $52,000
for a lot of land that had been of'ervd for
$50,000 to quibble about the price of a little
lumber where it became a question of the
health of the children.
A resolution directing that the yards
of the Everett and Hawthorne schools be
planked immediately passed without dis
sent.
A resolution requesting the Board of
Health to hold a meeting Friday morning,
for the purpose of receiving and confer
ring with the special committee of the
Board of Education, passed unanimously.
Joseph O'Connor, principal of trie
Horace Mann School, submitted a petition
with other principals and teachers, asking
that the proposed withholding of salaries
be deterred for the present, in view of the
approaching holidays and the "expeneses
incident thereto." The petition was
placed on tile.
A resolution to the effect that Brander
Matthews' "Introduction to the Study of
American Literature" be adopted as a
text-book for use in the seventh grade
classes and that "Select American Clas
sics" be adopted as a readinc book in the
bands of the pupils of the eighth grade
classes, was adopted, bo;h to co into use at
the opening of the school term in 18^-7.
A resolution was offered creating a high
school in the Mission, to b? onducteJ,
pending the erection of the high school
building, in the Hawthorne School ; that a
eiatt in the Horace Maun School lie trans
ferred to it, and that Charles H. Murphy
be chosÂ°n as its superintendent.
Superintendent Babcock, while paying
a tribute to Mr. Murphy and expressing
the hope that nader better conditions be
would be made the principal of the pro
posed high school, opposed the creation of
lhe school or the office at this time, while
funds were so short that ihesalaresof
teachers were beins withheld.
Others spoke in the s.une vein, and the
resolution failed to pass.
Superintendent Babe ck then brought
up the old question of the vacancy caused
by Director Murdock's resignation by ap
pointing Dr. George I. Drucker as his suc
cessor.
President Siott said there was nova
cancv in the board and refused to put the
questioned, lhe board adjourned to meet
Monday evening next.
PETERSON CONVICTED.
He lirutallv K<.;Â«t Hi* Â»tep<ou With a

DIPHTHERIA SPREADING.
Throe More Caftan Reported to the Board
of Health Yesterday. .
At the Board of Health yesterday three
more diphtheria cases were reported. They
were at 4241 Eighteenth street, 392 Dolores
street and at 5 Pond street. This makes
a total of thirty-four cases this month with
seventy-two cases during October and
November. Of the total number of 106 for
three months, but three deaths have re
sulted.
It is feared at the Health Board that
many cases are not reported because of
the reluctance of families to have their
houses quarantined. Immediately upon
a cÂ»Be being reported a health officer is
detailed to post a notice in front of the
house, giving warning that there is a case
of diphtheria within.

FOUR SEA DOGS
FALL BEFORE FITZ
A Battle Royal That Took
Place in Sausa
lito.
The Captains of Four Sailing
Ships Are Given a
Surprise.
They Tried Out Fitzsimmons at an
Old Eng ish Game, Which He Won
With Points to Spare.
"Don't talk to me about this man Fitz
simmons," was the pruff response of Cap
tain McKinnon of the good ship Belford,
on being asked what he thought of the
Cornishrnan as a puncher.
The captain is nursing a sore left arm
and while in a somewhat pleasant mood
yesterday afternoon he "let the pig out of
the bag" by relating to a small coterie of
friends an experience ho had had a few
evenings ago in Sausalito with Pugilist
Titzsimmons.
It appears that Captain McKinnon,
Richardson of the Pendragon Castle,
Moulton of the Pegasus and Pritchard ot
the Glenessiin decided to visit the famous
pugilist at ins training station aud see
him perform with the mittens. The three
vessels mentioned are at anchor near
Sausaliro.
Captain McKinnon was the owner of a
beautiful collie which accompanied him
to the fighter's headquarters in Sausalito.
It was the animal's last Trip ashore, how
ever, as it was run over and terribiy muti
lated by the train which was leaving the
depot for San Rafael.
''Poor Scot," said Captain McKinnon
as the tears ran down his cheeks, "wab
bled toward me with two of his lefts bro
ken ana a portion of his nose cut off. 1
'could not stand by and see my poor dog
suffering, and reluctantly I took my pis
tol from ray pocket and ended his pain by
sending a bullet through his head. The
day previous I received an offer of $200 for
the dog, but money could not purchase
him."
Well, the four commander? paid their
best respecis to lanky Bob, and after the
pugilist bad toyed witn the punching-bag
Jor some time McKinnon suggested tiiat a
little exercise would oe of much good to
them, and he a?ked Fitzsimmons it he
would object to a ristic interview with Ihe
big lour. The blonde wizard of the ring
"sized" his game up, and with h broad
smile on his handsome clean-cut counten
ance asfcect the capiains if that old Eng
lish game of "one down and the other
come on" would answer.
Richardson hesitated in giving an
answer, but when McKinnon, Pritchard
and Moulton agreed to the proposition,
Richardson acquiesced and the pueilist
and the heavy-weight mariners adjourned
to a compartment in the Pacific Yacht
Club where Filz lias daily set-tos with his
trainers.
"Will you have cloves enoueh to go the
rounds, Mr. Fitzsimmons?" queried
Captain Moulton as he glanced over his
shoulder at Captain Richardson, who was
prayine that the pugilist would answer in
the negative.
"Oh, I guess so." blandly replied the
man of muscle. "You see, we always ex
pect visitors wno are fond of the game
and occasionally we have a side show
which affords considerable amusement.
"Say, Juiian, " shouted 800 as his man
ager was leaving for the fiahter's resi
dence on the bill, "die into that trunk of
mine and you will iind' four brace of
three-ounce gloves, which will lit the cap
tains' tins to a nicety."
Richardson flopped into one of the big
cane-bottom chairs on the verandah of
the clubhouse and looked with longirsq
glances a., his ship, which was "at home"
Li Richardsons Bay. Even Piitchard,
who is said to be the conqueror of many
men whom he met in his younger days in
contests of fisticuffs, appeared rather un
ea-3% and in undertones suggested to
Captain McKinnon to call the thing off;
but McKinnon was obdurate, and whis
pered into Pritchard's ear that the harder
the gloves the quicker the battle would
end.
Moulton ran his fingers through his
hair and looked wise.
Julian returned to the clubhouse with
four pairs of gloves that had seen hare'
â¢ service. Fitz examined the mittens, and
glancing over at nis sparring partner, who
was chatting with Captain Richardson,
said:
"Why. Dan, I thought, those gloves
weighed three ounces, but I see that some
of the padding has been removed. They
can't possibly weigh more than two
ounces each, but I guess they are better
than no gloves at all."
Richardson took another fond glance at
his <;ood ship Pendragon Castle and won
dered if he ever would return alive to his
.men. Hickey was alive to the situation,
and after a short chat with Fitzsiramons
he rushed to the dwelling and returned
with a huge pitcher of ice water. Rich
ardson and Pritchard had a smile, but
McKinnon and Moulton positively re
fused an interview with the liquid that
never cheers.
"Now, gentlemen, if you will prepare
for action I think we can rush this thing
through before those newspaper men from
Frisco, who are expected here at any
moment, put in their appearance,"' sug
gested Mons. Julian, as he chuckled to
himself in anticipation of the heaps of fun
that was soon to come.
The captains were ushered into a small
room, where they made ready for the
game of "one man down aud the other
come on."
Richardson, being a twice- born English
man, would no: show the white feather
for love nor money, but he rebelled
strongly against the gloves, which he said
were altogether 100 sm.iil for him, but
when Trainer Hickey said that they were
the largest mittens that were ever made
for man he resigned himself to his fate
and hoped for the best.
McKinnon kept the spirits of his comr
raw TO-OAT.

ades up by pouring words of cheer into
their ears.
"Why, we will do up this big fellow in
less than five minutes, boys; he can't pos
sibly hurt us much at this game," re
marked McKinnon as he squared before a
large mirror and admired his figure.
"Well, 'pon my word, Me, I thinlc you're
right," said Moulton gleefully as he shook
the hand of his brother captain confi
dently.
Richardson and Pritchard appeared very
dubious, but when Pritcbard "announced
that he whipped Jim Mace once in a fair
stand-np fi^ht then all doubts were cast
aside, and the gallant seamen informed
Monsieur Julian that they were ready to
meet the enemy.
Long Bob was dressed In his usnal style â
cricket- pants and sweaterâ and as the gal
lant captains toed the scratch they took
the big right hand of the fighter in theirs
and shook it warmly.
"Are you ready, boys?" said Julian.
"We are!" they ail shouted simultane
ously.
"Then let her go, and may the best man
win," shouted Julian as he ran to a piace
of vantage over the fireplace.
The captains banged away with right
and left and Fitz received many hard cuffs
on body and neck, but he was dropping
his opponents in quick order and the con
test was short and spirited and according
to Mons. Julian's chronometer the battle
laied S}4 m'nutes, when the last of the
.Â«ea-fariiiÂ£ Mohicans cried "Enough, Me-
Duff; we came and saw, but you have con
quered."
McKinnon was the last man to face the
great fighter, but when his left arm fell
by his fide paralyzed from a blow he ac
knowledged defeat. Captains Richardson,
Moulton and Pritchard are now nursing
many wounds on board their respective
vessels, but according to Captain McKin
non they will be t-ufticiently convalescent
to enjoy a good turkey dinner this after
noon. At least it is hoped so, as they are
all good fellows.
MIDWEEK THEATER NOTES
Thanksgiving Matlnaes Will Be the
Â£Kule To-dayâ Continued Success
of Goodwin's New Play.
The combined attractions of Nat Good
win, Maxine Elliott and a new play by
Madeline Lucerte Ryley are sufficing to
draw good-sized audiences to the Baldwin
Theater. Tne play needs cutting and it is
rather of the Duchess style of literature but
it contains some brisrht lines and humorous
situations, and affords both Goodwin and
Miss Elliott congenial roles. Perhaps it
would be more correct to say that it af
fords Goodwin a congenial role, for all
parts are very much alike to pretty Miss
Elliott, who looks equally handsome in
any part, and seldom or never varies the
interpretation she gives to all parts-
Next Monday Milton Lackaye opens
with his new hypnotic play, "Dr. Bel
graff," at the Baldwin. Marie Wainwright
is his leading lady.
The Alcazar's enterprise in putting on a
new play has proved quite successful, for
"The End of the Century" is drawing ex
cellent houses. Tiie play is well staged
and receives a clever performance at the
hands of the stock company.
"Humanity" will run for the rest of the
week at the California Theater. On Mon
day evening the Humanity Company
will play "The New Soutii," written by
Clay H. Greene and Joseph Grismer. It
is a war play and its scenes are laid in
Georgia.
One of the chef attractions at the Grand
this week iÂ« the infant which appears in
'Hearts of OaK." This young person,
who is merely announced in the playbills
as "a stunner," manages to eclipse evea
the spectacular effect of the millwheel.
The infant is oi tender years â or, rather,
months â and she cries when she ought to
cry and laughs when her role demands
mirth with an intelligence which has
already made her a popular favorite. The
domestic drama "Hearts of Oak" is well
acted, the lighter characters winning their
tribute of laughter as well of applause.
"Donna Juanita" is closing its run at
the TivolL On Monday the old and favor
ite work, "The Little Duke." will be pre
sented. Groat preparations are being
made for "Jack and the Beanstalk, 1 ' the
Christmas production.
The Thanksgiving bill at the Orpbeum
is attracting well. Edward Heffernen,
the Irish comedian, has become a popular
favorite, and George Thatcher and Ed
Marble are doinj; some clever work. The
Hengler sisters have returned to the Or
pheum for one week only, and several
of last wr.ek's performers appear in
new acts. In spite of ah these
attractions, however, there is a lack of
novelty, which is felt by the faithful de
votees of vaudeville, who make a practice
of attending the Orpheum every week.
No doubt all this will be remedied when
Gustav Walter's new arrangement with
Colonel Hopkins relative to securing a
number of important European vaude
ville acts is carried into effect. The Chi
cago papers state that the two managers
have agreed to combine, and have already
cabled offers of engagement? to imuortant
music-hall artists.
Nearly all the theaters announce special
Thanksgiving matinees to-day.
In consequence of the demand to see
Loie Fuller an extra performance will be
given at the California Theater on Satur
day evening. Yesterday both at the mati
nee and the evening performance the
house was crowded.
Professor Kennedy continues his amus
ing hypnotic feats at the Bush-street The
ater. He has varied the performance this
week by tlie introduction of a iady subject.
Every schoolchild in San Francisco has
received a complimentary ticket for the
Chutes good this, to-morrow or Saturday
afternoon. The institution is a year old,
and takes this means of giving all the
youngsters a chance to participate in the
birthday celebration.
This afternoon Emil Markeberg will
make one ot his exciting balloon ascen
sions and parachute drops, and in the
evening there will be a magnificent dis
play of fireworks. Some elaborate set
pieces iiave beon prepared, ana the pyro
technics on the lake are promised to be
revelations.

the plumber-shop of A. Roth, 958 Howard
street, on September 25, and stole a quan
tity of plumbers' material.
He was arrested by Policemen T. L. Ryan
and Ed ODea, and sinoe then they have
been investigating into other burglaries
which they had good reason to believe
Phelan had committed.
Thej* found that on September 9 he
broke into tne shop of M. H. Dugan, 33J^
Geary street, and looted the place. Every
thing of value had been carried away.
The officers have located the stolen prop
erty.
Phelan's most successful attempt was in
the millinery-store of Miss I. E. Conner.
3ti Geary street, on September 22. She had
just received a consignment of French
hats and other stock, and Phelan made a
selection of ten of the most expensive hats,
fifteen rolls of silk ribbon valued at $150
and other material, altogether costing be
tween $600 and $700. Three of the hats
were recovered in the Blanco House,
Fourth and Perry streets, where Phelan
had sold them, and four of the rolls of silk
ribbon from Mrs. Smith, who keeps a
grocery and saloon at Fifth and Clara
streets.
Phelan had a fancy for carpets and he
broke into the vacant houses on Morton
street and stole all the carpets, which he
tore from the floors. He also stole a car
pet from 127 Ellis street and one irom a
house on Geary street, near Williams.
Several additional charges of burglary
will accordingly be booked against Phe
lan. He is a well-known petty thief, and
was once tried for killing a man, but was
acquitted.
Ryan and ODea have also been working
on other cases of burglary, and yesterday
they arrested Ezra Estes. a boy 15 years of
age. He was charged with having broken
into the house oi Mrs. Fred Thomas, BJÂ£
Harriet street, a few nights ago. and steal
ing four gold rings, a pair of gold cuff
buttons, a pair of opera-glasses, two gold
necklaces, and other articles of jewelry to
the value of about $200.
Estes when arrested confessed that he
had been with a bigger boy, who bad coni
mitted the burglary while he stood out
side. They carried the stolen property to
the basement of a vacant house at 8 Sun
shine place, between Howard and Folsom
street", and buried it. Estes took the
olncers to the place and they found the
stolen jewelry, which was later identified
by Mrs. Thomas.
Estes and his bigger companion are sus
pected also of having broicen into the
house of Mrs. McCabe, 128 Russ street,
and stolen a lady's gold watch and chain,
lady's silver watch, four gold lockets, five
gold scarfpins, pair of gold earring?, gold
chain and bracelet, two gold rings, four
gold charm" and other articles of jewelry.
They are also suspected of breakin<r into
the house at 22 Russ street and stealing a
quantity of jewelry.
The reason why they are suspected is
from the fact that tiie means of entrance
in each case was the same. The glass in
a rear window had been brofeen near the
catch, tfbich enabled the burglar to un
fasten the catch, open the window and
climb through. Advantage in each case
was also taken when the family was tem
porarily absent from the house.
Estes' companion is a peddler, and the
officers expect to have him under arrest
at any moment.

A <cm fn-ic.ii aa to National Guard
Orders Causes Some Trouble.
Naval ReHerve.
Grim-visaged war will be buzzing ere
long around the headquarters of the First
Infantry Regiment, Second Brigade, N.
G. C, Lieutenant-Colonel Victor D.
Duboce commanding, and the popular
regimental commander will probably not
be a victor, but a victim.
The casus belli came about in this wise :
Orders bearing date of November 2a were
issued by Brigadier-General Warfield to
Lieutenant-Commander Duboce for in
spection at 9 o'clock la*t evening, the first
part of which read as follows:
Tne colonels commanding the First and
Fitth Regiments will detail members of their
staffs to each of their companies, these officers
to act as inspectors and to make immediate
returns through channels.
These officers, acting as inspectors, will pay
particular attention to the following.
Then in a separate paragraph followed
the names of brigade Â»taff officers de
tailed by General Warfield to act as in
spectors.
Colonel Dnboce went ahead and de
tailed members of his staff as inspector?.
They finished their inspection of the two
battalions of the regiment at the Grove
street armory and dismissed the troops.
Scarcely had The last private laid down
his arms and empty enrtrid ire-box and
beat a rapid retreat to the carnival ball at
the Pavilion when General Warfield, stir-
I rounded with all the warlike glitter of a
full staff of brigade inspectors, arrived.
They found not the serried ranks of sol
diera with arms at present, but an armory,
still, deserted. Up in the regimental head
quarters the colonel with liis adjutant was
discussing the airship as a factor in mili
tia warfare unconscious of the campaign
about to burst upon him.
The astonished commander-in-chief
dispatched his own detailed inspector,
Major Charles Jansen, to scout, That of
ficer, all sabered, booted and spurred,
mounted the stairs, and, striding into the
presence of Colonel Deboce, demanded the
regiment for inspection.
The colonel tallied his orders on the
visitor and a somewhat stormy interview
took place. Then be returned to the gen
eral, who Jed his staff forthwith out into
the night, while the regimental com
mander in his office waited for the general
that never came. There was no inspec
tion of the First Infantry that nigbt.
The war correspondent of The Call in
terviewed General Warfield at the Cali
fornia Hotel later in the evening. That
officer would not state just what course
would be taken in dealing with the ap
parent disobedience of orders, but from
the conversation it was easy to see that
there is a battle not afar.
The report aa banded to Brigadier War
field at midnight last night showed 544
officers and men present.
Word to report in heavy marching
order came to Lieutenant- Commander
Turner of the Naval Battalion dur
ing yesterday afternoon. In an hour
and three-quarters he had the four
Hotchkiss cuns and all their gear
landed from the Comanche by a
hastily summoned landing party, and at

SENATOR FAIR'S SANITY.
Judge Slack Will Hear Tei'lmony on
This Point NÂ«Â»xt Saturday.
Judge Slack yesterday decided to hear
testimony in regard to the sanity of the
late Jnmes G. Fair before closing the case
of Charles L. Fair against the trustees
named in his father's will. This is re
garded as a point in favor of the trustees,
for the reason that though the children of
Fair were willing to have him adjudged
sane for tne purpose of having his will ad
mitted to probate, they might try to prove
him Insane when it came to their effort to
have the trust clause set aside. The hear
ing of the witnesses has been set for 10
o'clock next Saturday morning.
