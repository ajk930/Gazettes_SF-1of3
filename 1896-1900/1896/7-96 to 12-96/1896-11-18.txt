LONDON, Ej?g., Nov. 17.â The Morning
Post will to-morrow publish a dispatch
from Madrid saying advices there show
f that Captain-General Weyler was to ad
i vance into the mountains in the province
of Pinar del Rio, his line of march being
i-outhward between Mariel and Baya
honda. He has captured a large number
of stragglers from Maceo's forces. Maceo.
according to the ad vie sj, continues to re
tire as the Spaniards advance, being
afraid to ri>k a battle.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 17.â Senor
Dupuy de Lome says that ihe alleged in
terview in which he is made to say that
war between the United States and Spain
is possible and that it would be terrible in
its effects is a fabrication. He has not
spoken to a correspondent for days, and
has never made any such statement to
any person. On the contrary, be asserts
the relations of Spain with tfre United
r-;ates were nev r more amicable than
now.
NEW YORK. N. V., Nov. 17.â A Times
special from Washington says: It is de
nied here on high naval authority that
Admiral Bunce's fleet is going to tbe
We*t Indies. Navy officials scout the
i lea and say the fleet is in no condition to
go, even if there was cause for its moving.
Admiral Bunce and his flag lieutenant,
Osteriiaus, are both here and they refuse
to talk for publication.
The Spanish war scare is ridiculed by
the Navy Department, and the authority
* for the denial of the proposed movement
of the fleet, although he cannot be named,
is sufficiently high in rank to give weight
to his words.
A special cable dispatch to the Herald
from Havana say?:
Genera: Weyler is expected back from
the field this week. La Lucha advises
calmness and patience, as General Weyler
must be given time by bis critic* here and
in Spain.
There is utter silence here as to the
If suit of General Weyler' s movements in
â  Pinar del Rio. A prisoner of war, Bastolo
Silva Galardo. was shot to-day in the
fortress Cabana. He was accused of re
bellion and incendiarism.
PHILADELPHIA. Pa., Nov. 17.â The
Grand Jury of the United Stales District
Court to-day found three true bills against
John D. Hurt. Mr. Hart's connection or
alleged connection with various filibuster
ing expeditions to Cuba are well known,
and the indictments found against him
. to-day are based upon charges of filibus
tering, but heretofore the Government
has failed to prove its cases against him.
WAR IS ABOUT DUN.
Bo the Ordnance Otficir* Are Anxious
Concerning Const Defense*. .
WASHINGTON', D. C, Nov. 15. -The
annual report of ihe Board of Ordnance
and Fortifications, composed of General
Nelson A. Miles, Colonel Royal T. Frank,
First Artillery; Colonel Peter C. Haines,
corps of engineers; Major Phipps, ord
nance department ; Captain J. C. Myers
and Representative J. H. Outhwaite was
. made public to-day. It says:
"Under the increased appropriations of
the present fiscal year the work of placing
our harbors in a proper state of defense is
Baking good progress, and if only the
same sums are appropriated annually for
a few years, our principal ports will pre
sent a formidable front to an attacking
fleet. It is hoped, however, that even
â¢ mure liberal appropriations will be made
in. order that we should be ready for any
emergency that might arise at any time.
In view of the present serious aspect of
European politics, it is only common
prudence for this Nation to be on its guard,
for should a conflict ariss, we are liable to
be embroiled with some power whose
navy in the present condition of our
coasts, might destroy or exact enormous
:a â isurns lrom our chief cities.
"A war, if it come at all, will come
without warning and no time for prepara
tion. China, with undefended ports and
an inadequate navy, was defeated in a
few months. In tne last war between the
great military powers of Germany and
France the surrender at Sen an occurred
forty days after the declaration of war.
'The wars of nations occur in cycles of
varying length, but seldom does a genera
tion pass without a conflict. Already
more than thirty year* have elapsed since
our last great war and another may occur
soon if the past be a guiae to the future.
One of the longest intervals of peace we
have ever en joyed has occurred.
"Our ordnance department is prepared
with designs for guns and carriages that
are equal to any in the world. If Congress
will but increase the appropriations to the
capacity of those departments for useful
â  and economical work it will not be long
before our sea coasts are secure against
the attacks of a foreign foe. An effective
preparation for war is the best safeguard
aga:nst war."
The report of the board on aeacoast ar
tillery fire recommends that in the con
struction of fortifications now being placed
in position due consideration be given to
providing a system of communication be
tween batteries and lor all necessary ap
pliances, and that appliances for this sys
tem be provided at Fort Monroe, Fort
Hancock and San Francisco harbor, where
higher power pneumatic guns and mortar
k batteries are now in position or under con
strue ion.
The board visited the various factories
of ordnances and was Impressed with the
lack of economy and irregularity and nn
cenainty with which tfiÂ« work is carried
on under the present system of making
The San Francisco Call
appropriations. The board is more ih n
ever convinced of ihe wisdom of the re
marks in i's last annual report that rejju
ar annual appropriations be made for
seacoast defenses and tbeir armament.
AT THE BEGOKLVS TARD
Considerable Work B'ina />Â©Â»Â« to Get
H'-'nhip* in Rra*ine*s.
NEW YORK. N. V., N*v. 17âThou
sands visited the Brooklyn Navy-yard Sun
day, and admired the great war vessels
that stand ready to defend the honor of
the American flag in all climes and under
all circumstances. It was by far the most
notable Sunday at the yard for visitors
this year, and the officers commented over
the unusual number of men in the throng.
Every evidence of readiness for active con
fl.ct was approved by the people.
Interest seemed chiefly to center about
the Texas, but solely, as could be learned
readily from the conversation of the visit
ors, on account of the recent notoriety
gained by that unlucky fighting machine.
From the Texas thÂ« throng streamed to
the New York, the Maine and the Indiana,
wbicb, it was said, were ready to sail im
mediately. No less enthusiasm was shown
for the cruiser Montgomery, and the great
monitor Puritan and the ram Katahdin.
Much curiosity was shown by visitors to
the dismantled Essex, Chicago and At
lanta as to when these vessels would be
ready, like the others. Nothing definite
was stated about any of these.
Another unfailing object of interest was
the torpedo-boat Ericsson, which was
damaged badly by a recent accident in the
yard. The broken and twisted plates
have been removed, and as the vessel now
appears she is anything but formidable in
appearance. It is said at the yards that
the repairs are being pushed and will be
speedily finished on this as well as on all
the other engines of protection and de
struction now at their moorings.
Possibly, out of regard for Sunday there
wa? no outward evidence of work going on
in the navy-yard. But the outward calm
did not mean that work had been entirely
discontinued. Far down in the Texas an
army of men were at work all day remedy
ing the results of ber latest mishap. Oth
ers were working in the Essex and the
Puritan, and for this reason visitors were
somewhat restrained in tbeir movements
on these vessels.
In the machine-shop also it was noticed
as 5 o'clock appro<tcned that a score or
more of men suddenly appeared about the
lath ?, and the steam in the boiler regis
tered sixty pounds on a gauge. What
these men were to do through the night
the foreman declined to say, but it is
likely that they are at work In connection
with the repairing now going on in the
Texus.
The Texas' hull has stood the strain of
docking without apparent injury. Her
machinery has suffered severely from the
immersion in salt water, bnt the damage
is of a kind that may be easily overcome.
It is said that the Texas is certain of being
out of the drydock within a week.
â  Even before the gates of the Brooklyn
Navy- yard were opened yesterday a crow 1
of men numbering several hundred had
congregated gj opposite rT the ~ new ; e-ste J at
Sands and -Navy streets. | All were look
ing for work. -Inside the yard yesterday
the activity showed no signs of abate
ment.
Among the officers and men in the yard
there is a great deal of speculation going
on as to what the intentions of the Gov
ernment are. Admiral Bunce, command
ing the fleet, has returned from Washing
ton and has had two long interview* with
Commodore Sicard, commandant of the
navy-yard. The result of theae interviews
none of the subordinates know, and Com
modore Sicard absolutely refuses to dis
close them.

( tibnn Affair*.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 17.-Con

Secretary Rockbill. AH the Cabinet offi
cers attended their regular meeting with
the President to-day, it being generally

SCANDALS IN WILLIAM'S ARMY.
Radical Interpellation on the Murder of a
Citizen by a Bully in German
Uniform.
BERLIN, Germany, Nov. 17.â The Rad
ical interpellation on the recent murder of
Herr Biebemann at Carlsruhe by Lieuten
ant Baron yon Bruzewiz and other mili
tary outrages ana scandals, and also upon
the question of dueling, was ordered :n
the Reichstag to-day in the presence of a
full house and packed galleries.
The motion was offered by Herr Munc
kel, Richlerite Radical, who, in the cour-e
of his remarks, referred to the concluding
sentences of the Emperor's address to the
Reichsiac last week. The words of the
Kaiser, Herr Mnnckel said, could have
but one meaning, and that was whoever
insulted the King's coat insulted the King
himself. This interpretation of the
Kaiser's words elicited ironical cheers
trom the members of the Left and uoisy
cries from the members of the Right and
the speaker was vociferously cheered by
the Radicals when he declared that Lieu
tenant yon Bruzewiz was a criminal whose
liberty endangered the safety of peaceful
citizens.
Prince Hohenlohe replied by reading a
declaration from the Emoeror ordering an
entire new stipulation in the court ol
honor, wnich was in effect that the courts
must not necessarily interfere in a duel.

Maceo's Stronghold in the Rubi Hills, Pinar Del Rio Province.
Four coKimns of Spanish troops are now advancing upon General Maceo. Captain-General Weyler, who left hla
palace at Havana to take personal command of the renewed campaign against the unconquerable insurgents, has five
batteries and six pieces of artillery from Mariel Munos, six battalions from Cabanas and five battalions from Candelaria.
Generai Echeaque is also advancing with four battalions from Artunesia. The plan of the Spanish is to surround the

marks said:
"In following a time-honored custom of
the Chamber of Commerce and congratu
lating you upon having reached another
anniversary period in its history 1 cannot
refrain from making mention of the start
ling issu-s that were forced into the lust
campaign, with ail their accompanying
conditions of anxiety and misgiving. In
deed, I may say the gravity of this expe
rience was not alone confined to commerce
and industry. Its influence had a much
wider scope and was acutely felt through
out the length and breadth of this land
by every conscientiously intelligent man
and lover of his c mntrr.
"Major McKinley's election means more
to us than any other election that lias
taken place in this country since we won
our way into tbo family of nations. Before
him lies the great and glorious opportu
nity of winning back to this land its com
mercial conditions of prosperity and giv
ing contentment and happiness to every
household. At the same time a grave re
sponsibility will rest with his adminiotra
tion, for it can make or mar many interests
in this great country. With an abiding con
fidence in his intellect, the Chumber of
Commerce, in tendering its congratula
tions io him, realizes in the fullest, its
hopefulness and happiness, and offers a
cheering and sympathetic Go lspeed."
The following was then read by Presi

Executive Mansion, *
Washington, I>. C, Nov. 17, 1896. j
Alexander E. Orr, President, etc.â Oiae fciÃ:
The pleasures which participation in the ban
quets which tbe Chamber of Commerce Las
afforded rue In the pat. Â»ni the kindly feeling
and broad spirit of enterprise which mways
pervades the occasion, cause me to regret most
sincerely that I cannot join the goodly com
pany that will gather around the chamber's
hospitable evening. Recent events may well
cause those who represent business interests
to rejoice in their escape from threatened
peril. But while they have abundant reason
for rejoicing and can view with the greatest
satisfaction the support they have given sound
money in the contest lately waged against it,
I earnestly hope that in this time of
congratulation it will remember that
constant vigilance and continued effort are
required to maintain present conditions, and
that absolute safety will only be secured when
oar financial system is protected by affirma
tive and thorough reforms. When our busi
ness men are habitually alert and watchful,
ana when they are, moreover, fully aroused
to the importance of such legislative action
concerning our finances as business method e
approve and the weliare of the entire country
requires, much good may be confidently ex
pected, not only m the accomplishment oil
practical good; bat in listing good to the peo
ple of the country. Yours very truly.;

CO NFIDENCE IS RESTORED
Lloyd of the London. Statist Talk* About
McK-inley'* Election.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 17.â T. Lloyd
of the London Statist, who has just re
turned from a tour of the country for the
purpose of studying the agricultural and
commercial conditions, in an interview
with a reporter of the United Associated
Presses to-day said :
"McKinley's election will give an im
petus to trade en this side and will induce
the investment of British capital in Ameri
can securities. Although there was an
undoubted disposition on the part of Lon
don to leave American stocks alone until
the election was over, I don't think it was
caused by any real fear that America
would really declare itself on the side of
anything having the appearance of repu
diation. Of course, inasmuch as t..e ieel
ing in this country was that the situation
was acute, its infection spread to England,
and I would like to emphasize ihe fact
that this was the only cause of any depre
ciation of American securities that look
place on tbe London market.*'
He declared that in his journey across
the continent he noted signs of a great
activity in trade since McKinley's elec
tion, and he looked forward to a gradual
and steady improvement in the commer
cial and industrial conditions of thecoun
try. One of the most significant signs of
the revival, he added, was that it seemed
to have a solid basis.

EDITOR CONN IS EXPELLED.
The General Assemb'y of the Knights of
Labor Sustains the Action of the
Executive Board.
ROCHEBTER, N. V., Nov. 17.â The
General Assembly of the Knights of La
bor to-day took up the report of the com
mittee on strikes and grievances. The
case of ex-Congressman C. G. Conn, editor
and partial owner of the Washington
Times, was considered at length. Mr.
Conn was charged with making malicious
statements .about the general master
workman and general secretary of the
order in his paper. He was suspended by
the National Executive Board several
months ago and from that sentence ap
pealed to the General Assembly.
As a result of to-day's deliberation, Mr.
Conn was expelled from the order and his
paper placed upon the list of unfair
papers.
The committee on co-operation pre
sented a paper from District Assembly 79
of Minneapolis, explaining a scheme of
co-operation in distributing the neces
saries of life.
After discussion it was agreed the plan
was no: in sufficient detail and was not in
shape to be adopted by the General As
sembly. The report of the committee on
sate of the order was next taken up and
ways of strengthening the organization
were discussed.
The reading of the decisions of Generai
Master Workman Sovereign was the first
bnsiness at the afternoon session.
Immediately following this was the
election of officers. J. R. Sovereign was
re-elected General Master Workman and
General Secretary-Treasurer Hayes wns
re-elected, both without opposition. It
was expected that there would be a fight,
but when the lime came there was no one
with sufficient nerve to go against them.
For the next highest office, that of eeneral
worthy foreman, Thomas Maguire of New
York was chosen. His opponent was
Phillip L. Aamon of New Jersey. The
ballot was: Maguire, 34; Aamon, 23.

which Miss Susan B. Anthony, who re
turned from California this morning, was
accorded an ovation.
A letter has bo en received l.ere from the
Rev. Mrs W. L. Watson of Santa Clara
County. California, which gives some light
on the failure of the suffragist amendment
at the recent election. Mrs. Watson says
ir was all owing to the whisicy ring in San
Francisco.
Miss Susan B. Anthony was seen by a
reporter. She said:
"Our work in California has been largely
political. We had our suffragist meetings
all through the State, and the various
political parties indorsed it in therr plat
forms with the exception of the Demo
crats. It was defeated by a few votes.
"A short time before election it looked
as though the amendment to the consti
tution admitting woman to suffrage would
be earned by a large majority.
"T.;e San Francisco Call came out early
in the season stating that it stood for us,
and over 300 papers in the State also crave
their support. It was the liquor interest
that prevented us lrom carrying the
amendment. All the liquor associations
of Oakland and San Francisco met in con
vention shortly b-fore election and or
dered a letter sent to every brewer em
ployed in the State with the proposed
amendment stamped in large letters, 'No.'
This killed it. We are not defeated, even
in California, and our workers are busy
now preparing; another monster petition
to the State Legislature.''

BRUTAL MURDER
OF A WILD RIDER
Guy Hudson-Piller Struck
Down by Companion
Elliott.
Were Members of Buffalo Bill's
Wild West Shew and Sup
posed Friends.
Remarkable Coo ness of the Assassin,
Whose SJe Object Was
Robbery.
OMAHA, Nebb., Nov. 17.â Guy Hudson-
Piller, lately a nd>r in tue American sol
diers of Buffalo Bill's Wild We3t Show,
was most brutally murdered by G. Elliott,
his companion, this afternoon at their
room in the Winsor Hotel. The motive
was evidently robbery, and the muiderer
has fled from the city after a most remark
able exhibition of coolness after his crime.
When Buffalo Bill's show disbanded for
the winter at Moberley, October 24, ten of
the riders in the gay soldiery came to this
city and soon left for their homes, save
Hudson-Piller, Elliott and Jack Vannoy.
The latter is now working in the city.
Hudson-Piller had been injurei by be
ing thrown on the pommel of hie saddle
and wanted to remain In the city a few
riavs for medical treatment. So be and
Eiliott went to the Metropolitan Hotel,
and two days later the injured man went
to St. Joseph's Hospital. Elliott bad no
money, so he was put out for non-payment
of board jnst at the time that Hudson-
Piller left the hospital, and both went to
the Winsor, having left all their baggage,
except a small handbag, registerin . No
vember 10, from Marquette, Wyo., and
being assigned to a room on the second
floor of the hotel.
Proprietor Bntler heard of the deal at
the Metropolitan, and insisted upon pay
ment during the week. Elliott left bis
watch as security for a week's board, and
Hudson-Piller on Monday paid his bill to
date. Elliott announced that both were
going to the Big Horn for the winter, pre
sumably to Marquette, Wyo., where
Hudson-Piller has a ranch, and where a
brother lives. To-day after dinner Hudson-
Piller was chatting with A. R. Butler in
the office, wuen about 3 o'clock Elliott
called him Io the head of the stairway.
Tbe latter responded, and as he ascend' d
the stairway that was tbe last seen of him
alive.
Two hours later Elliott returned to the
office, paid his own biil for the week, re
ceived his watch and also paid the bill for
tbe one day for his companion. Not a
trace of nervousness was seen in his man
ner, and he quickly accepted an invitation
given by A. R. Butler to step across Jack
son street to a saloon. After chatting a
few minntes Butler returned alone, and
just at 4 o'clock Elliott again went into
the office, remarked that he would have
time to get shaved and went to a barber
shop. Upon his return he invited Butler
to drink with him. and after a minute's
conversation looked at his watch and
starl.ed to the depot to catch tbe Burling
ton train west to Billings, Mont., at 5:35.
A stockman stopping at tne hotel, who
knew El.iott, saw him at the depot a few
minutes later, but is not certain as to his
movements.
Clerk Stewart Stough of the Winsor
Hotel supposed that both men had gone,
and ordered the chambermaid on that
floor to fix up the room. It was about
5:40 o'clock when she wenc to the room,
found it locked, and with ber pass key un
locked and slightly pushed open the door
:ind started to step inside. Her foot
slipped In a pool of blood and she saw the
body of a man lying on the bed. She
called the clerk, who entered the room,
?aw the condition of affairs and the police
and Coroner were immediately notified.
The theory is that when Eiliott called his
companion, Hudson-Piller, to their rpom
he preceded him, hid behind the door and
struck the latter his death blow with an
iron car coupling pin. In Elliott's mus
cular arm the instrument crushed his
victim's skull on the left side as if it were
an egg shell. Never a moan was uttered
as the man sank to the floor. Three more
blows were struck, one of which again
crushed in the skull. A mass of clotted
blood marts the spot where the victim
lay on the floor.
The bloody corpse was placed upon tht
bed, a towel was thrown over the face and
the trousers pockets were gone through
for money. They were left turned out.
As not a cent was left the murderer's suc
cess may be judged. The coupling pin was
lying in a corner covered with blood and
hidden wiih a newspaper. Bloody towels
in tbe slopjar indicated that the murderer
had caiefuily cleansed himself of the
Dlood before venturing from tne room.
Talcing everything of value except the
dead man's medicine and surgical appli
ances he locked the door and carried away
the key. It is not known just how much
money Hudson-Pilier had left, but he had
a $100 bill changed at the drugstore, where
he bought some medicine iast Sunday, and
then remarked to Vannoy, a mutual
friend, who was with him, that it was all
he had left of his summer's wa^es.
Both men were finely developed, tall
and muscular. The dead man was a
blonde, with a heavy light mustache,
about 5 feet 10 incnes in height and about

Elliott is a six-footer, with black hair
and mustache, and also about 30 years of
age. He joined tne show during its
travels about three months ago, and not
much is known of his life. The inscrip
tion bn the watch which he left with Mr.
Butler gave his name and his home at
some town in Ohio which Mr. Butler has
forgotten.
Coroner Uurk-tt, who immediately re
moved the body to tbe Morgue, will hold
the inquest to-morrow. Dr?. Blytbin and
Towne have made the post-mortem exami

Piller's brother, but has receivea no reply.
Detectives are now working on the case
with a good chance of soon appre

manner in which the murder was con

has appeared to Dave blazed his path his
capture Is certain.

NEW MECCA FOR PUGS.
Dan Stuart Baa n Place Where 2 hey
Can Tight Without Tear.
EL PASO. Tex., Nov. 18.â Dan Stuart,
after a fantastic chase over the country,
has at last settled on a spot where he may
pull off any prize-fight without fear of po
lice interference. That place is on the
Mexican side of the river near El Paso
del None. Backed by a syndicate of
American capitalists, mostly Texan s he
recently made a trip to tbe City of Mex
ico and there obtained a concession
tbat places him in indisputable
possession of a tract of land
on which he may erect an arena, club
house, etc., and make such improvements
as he may decide upon, and pull off bis
fights without interruption of any kind.
Stuart will now make a bid for the Cor
beti-Fitzsininions affair under circum
stances where a large pnrse may be guar
anteed, and under the charter by
the Mexican Government he may put the
"pugs" into the ring and fight them to a
finish.
It is said that the improvements will be
made at once. It is further stated tbat the
syndicate will guarantee money for purses
and that some of the highest purses in the
history of the prize-ring will shortly be
scheduled.

NATIONAL COUNCIL
OF JEWISH WOMEN
Many Subjects of Interest
to the Race Are Under
Discussion.
Rabbi Mendes Speaks of Chil
dren Honoring Parents Who
Are Styled Sinners.
"Examples at Hems Needed in Order
to Bring Up Good Jews and
Jewesses."
NEW YORK, K. V., Nov. 17.â The third
day's session of the first convention of the
National Council of Jewish Women began
this morning in the Tuxedo. President
Hannah G. Solomon called the conven
tion to order. There was a large attend
ance of delegates. After the reading of
some reDorts from vice-presidents of sec
tions that were not beard from before, the
next on the programme was the reading
of the report on "National Religion" by
Miss Felsenthalt of Chicago.
At tbe conclusion of the reading of the
report Miss Sarah Clauson of this city took
the platform and presented a report which
ebe said was a report from the committee
on L'ible study. "Dr. Moras of Phildel
phia has," she said, "written a criticism
in which he says the reading of the Bible
is detrimental to Judaism."
After some discussion a motion was car
ried that Rev. Dr. Burkovitz of Philadel
wbia, who was present, should give his
opinion on the book.
Dr. Burkovitz then took the floor. He
said be did not believe it was wise for the
convention at this time to pass on theo
logical themes. "I can simply say," said
he, "that the Jewish Chautauqua Society
has adopted Dr. Montefiore's Bible, with
certain reservations.
The report of the National committee
on religion was then presented to the con
vention.
Miss Julia Richman presented the report
of tbe National committee on religious
school work.
Rabbi H. P. Mendes of New York, next
took the platform. "You will never suc
ceed," he said, "in turning out good Jews
and Jewesses unless you and your hus
bands show the children examples at
Lome. Your children come to the syna
gogue and hear us say what sinners their
parents are and in the next moment we
say to them 'honor thy father and
mother.' "
This was received with a laugh. Dr.
Mendes further said that he deplored the
lack of interest taken in the Jewish cere
monies of consecration and deplored what
he called the abominable system cf feeing
minivers.
Mrs. Todhelmuth, president of the bo
rosis, was next accorded a hearing. She
greeted the council on behalf of Sorosis
and invited the members to become mem
bers of the fctat'j Federation oi Women's
Clubs.
Mrs. Carrie S. Benjamin of Denver pre
sented the report of the National commit
tee on philanthropy. The report waa
adopted.
Committees were appointed and a re
cess was taken. After recess Mrs. Mary
Lowe Dickinson, president of the National
Council of Women of the West, delivered
Â»n address.
The election of officers will take place
next Thursday morning.
Tbe afternoon se sion was largely at
tended. Tije session opened with the
reading of a telegram from the National
Women's Christian Temuerance Union,
now holding its annual convention in Si.
Louis. Tbe telegram was as follows:
"Cordial greetings. We are workers to
gether for God and humanity."
Tbe telegram was received with ap
plause and it was resolved to send a tele
gram conveying the fraternal greetings of
the Nationel Council of Jewish Women to
the St. Louis convention. Mrs. Helen M.
Henrotin, Cbicago, president 'of tbe Gen
eral Federation of Women's Clubs, then

United States Court here to-day Judge
Jenkins entered an order discharging
Frank G. Bigelow and Edwin H. Mo-
Henry as receivers for the Northern Pa
cific in the consolidated action. The
order, however, does not determine the

the appointments of ; the receivers under
the supplemental bills of complaint filed
1 ast May. The receivers ; are _ required â¢to
furnish new bonds of $50,000 each within
ten days. . .
Judge Jenkins has referred to Special
Master Carey the matter of making â¢an

reserves the right to at any time retake
and resell the property for the purpose of
satisfying any indebtedness or liability of
the. receivership. The order makes no
mention of the compensation which the
discharged receivers are to receive".

r.dison Baa Great Taith in the Wonder-
ful X Ray.
NEWARK, N. J., Nov. 17.â Thomas A.
Edison said yesterday that he did not
doubt the story from San Francisco re
garding young Bacigalupi* the blind boy,
who claims that the cathode ray enables
him to distinguish objects.
"Such a thiiig is possible," Edison said.
"Why, I recently learned by accident
that though tbe X rays are invisible with
out the use of a fluornscope, by putting
my hand over my eye 1 could plainly dis
cern anything behind it. In the light of
my discovery I can nee that a mistake was
made in tbe San Francisco experiment.
The boy should have looked directly at
the X rays."

RELATIONS ARE STRAINER
Troapeet of Trouble Between Chile and
Argentine.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 17.â T;.e
Herald's Valparaiso cabin hays: It is
semi-otticially reported tbat tbe relations
between Chile and Argentine are again
strained. Chile made a proposition to
Argentine to enter into an agreement to
disarm. Tbe reply of Argentine was that
in the arbitration protocol accepted two
months ago there was no clause calling for
disarmament, and that the Government
did not propose to do so.
Politicians declare tbat Chile will soon
renew her propositon in more pointed and
explicit terms. It is considered probable
that in tbe case of a second refusal this
Government will resort to stronger
measures.
Additional Tax on Beer.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 17.â A Times
special from Washington says: An at
tempt will be made during the coming
session of Congress to put an additional
tax ot $20,000,0u0 on beer. The champions
of the proposition say that the tax would
not involve any additional expense to tbe
Government and would be very easily
collected. Others say, however, that there
is no likelihood of such a bill passing.
They say tbe brewers were able tc defeat
it before, and they are just as able now.

TANGLED SANTA
FE RECEIVERSHIP
Attorneys Wrangling Over
the Trap Set by Bold
Speculators.
Collusion Between the Company
and a Kansas Oificial Is
Alleged.
D cided Increase in the Conflict Be
tween tbe Stats and Federal
Courts.
OSKALOOSA, Kans., Nov. 17.â The
Saota Fe receivership is in court again. This
afternoon Judge Myers, at a special term
of the District Court here, heard the mo
tion nled before him by Attorney Keeler,
asking that the amendments filed by
Assistant Aitorney-General A. A. Goddard
oe stricken from the original petition, Mr.
Keeler's motion having been based on the
following grounds:
Firstâ Neither the court nor the county at
torney eyer ordered, directed or consented to
the filing of kaid document.
Secondâ That said document, was filed in
pursuance of a collusive agreement and work
ing oetween the Santa Fe and one A. A. God
dard, assistant to the Attorney-General of the
Slate of Kansas, for the purpose of getting this
document removed out of this court and for
the purpose of defeating the State in Us effort
to enforce the laws.
Thirdâ The plaintiff, by said county attor
ney, disdains and renounces the allegations in
said document, and claims mat they form no
part of the statement of the plaintiffs' cause of
action.
After argument Judge Myers sustained
the motion and tho amendments were
ordered stricken from the petition.
Assistant Attorney-General Goddard's
affidavit, in which he alleged tbat Keeler
had proposed to the Santa Fe attorneys
that for a consideration he would remove
the case from the courts was ruled out by
Judge Myers.
The motion of Attorney Hurd for the
railroad company to transfer the case to
the Federal court was overruled. Tho
effort of the attorney to knock out attor
neys Keeler and Hite was also unsuccess
ful.
It will be remembered that a note was
sent them by County Attorney Pninney
dismissing them lrom any further work
in the case, which action, it was alleged,
was instieated by tbe Santa Fe attorneys.
To-day Mr. Pninney frankly admitted
tbat he did not know just what to do, and
Judge Myers came to his aid and the noti
fication mentioned was stricken trom the
file, and the court held tbat Pninney was
supreme.
Receiver C. F. Johnson, who was ap
pointed by Judge Myers, has never quaii-
Ded, aud a motion was made by Judpe
Keeier asking that a new receiver be
named. Action on this motion was de
ferred until to-morrow.
In the matter of contempt proceedings
Attorneys Keelerand Hite made a motion
to the court to cite the Attorney-General
to appear before him and show cause why
be should not be tried for contempt, and
Judge Myers stated that he would proba
bly do this at a special session of the court.
To-morrow's proceedings â the court hav
ing adjourned till to-morrow morning
promise to be very interestiner, as the con
flict between the State and Federal court
as to authority is waxing warm. Judge
Myers is highly indignant at the course
taken, and proposes to sustain the dignity
of his court.

Weak Men and WomenSANG OF LOVE AS
FOES DREW NEAR
Mexican Ser3naders Fired
Upon by Jealous
Rivals.
Battle Under the Windows oi
. El Cajon Valley's Fairest
â¢ Siveral Youths Wound.d in an
Affray Following a Merry
Fandango.
SAN DIEGO. Cal.. Nov. 17.â There was
a fandango in the pacni vale of El Cajon
Sunday night and all the pretty Mexican
girls were there with their tall and
swarthy sweethearts. The party was
given at Mipuel Acosta's house, at the foot
of the big hills separating the valley from
the Jamacha country. Geronimo and
Ramon Martinez, brothers, and Donaciano
Flores were the tiddlers three. Among
the euests were the Estrada boys â Fior
â¢ encio and Apustin, the Arces, Halmas and
others, some ol them the scions of famous
old families, and othey the scum of
Mexico. Tuere were one or two profes
sional smugglers in the party and they
â¢were as fine dancers an<i expert lady
killers as tneie were on the floor.
Tne Gonzales girls, the belles of Mexi
can society, were at the fandango and they
favored t tie company, by dancing the jota
in true Spanish style. Ciemente Esparza,
a good-looking young lellow, played the
guitar, accompanying the dancers, and
tuis fatal act of gallantry started all the
ruction.
The Estrada boys gathered their factions
and drew off in high du<lgeon. There
were sallies at parting, but knives were
carefully adjusted in (lie bootlegs. The
t Gonzales girls sent a cruel smiie after the
departing gallants that served to key tneni
up to desperation. About midnight the
belles of the ball withdrew to their home,
not a half-mile distant, and soon after
young Esparza the guitarist, with the
iiartmez boys and Donaciano Flores, the
other fiddler, went over to make meicdy
under the windows of the sweet joven
citas who nad won their smiles. The Es-
trada faction had entirely disappeared and
was supposed to be dreaming.
The mellow mingling of nasal tenor and
vibrant catgut had hardly begun to ravish
. the ears of the girls before a clatter of
hoofs struck terror to the ears of the
Romeos. Two minutes later the Estrada
faction gathered on a little knoll behind
the house, dismounted and began to shoot.
Donaciano Flores fell at the first volley
with a bullet through his shoulder.
The musicians gathered together like a
flock of sheep, and only one â Ramon Mar
tinez â had the presence of mind to draw a
weapon. He toon out a revolver and fired
into the bunch of assailants and hit An-
Justin E>-trada in the forehead, the bullet
grazing tde eyebrow and passing around
the corner of the victim's head. He
dropped, and then the tight began in
earnest.
Ftorvncio Estrada had separated fjom
his gang and crept up to the corner of his
bouse. He aimed at his arch enemy, the
handsome Ciemente Kaparza, and fired.
The bullet struck E*parza's band, and two
lingers flew off and a jet of blood imbrued
the guiiar he held. Ramon Martinez fired
the contents of his revolver at the intrud
ers, but did not hit them.
The Acosta people, dancing away in the
house, got wind of the scrimmage at the
home oi the pretty girls, and all mounted
their horses and hurried over. The shoot
ing was in full proeress. The newly ar
rived Mexicans unlimbered their suns and
started shooting, apparently indiscrimin
ately. The resuit was a three-cornered
fight in which no man knew his friend,
and was forced to treat all as foes.
The fight lasted until the available
ammunition was gone. Then the Estrada
gang started out to cross the Mexican
line. A constable followed them as far as
Otay and captured Fiorencino Estrada,
â¢who made no resistance. The others got
across the line and gathered at a res
taurant in Tia Juana and laughed and
jokeil over the affair. Florencio Esirada,
. ihe only prisoner, was released on his
recognizance pending an investigation.
The American authorities are nonplused
over the affair, not knowing which faction
to believe and being unable to determine
who are in the wrong. Three of the men
who escaped over the line carried wounds.
TOMS OF COYOTE SCALPS.
Claims Filed lor Over Thirteen Thousand in

Months.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Nov. 17.â There
was no me ting of the State Beard 'of
Examiners yesterday, owing to the ab
sence of Governor Budd and Attor
ney-General Fitzgerald, and as a
consequence the aggravating question of
making a recommendation concerning an
- appropriation for. pay ing certified coyote

Secretary Markley has, however, -com
f pleted his report on the list of counties
which the board consider doubtiul.
â¢ Secretary of State , Brown has con
tended all along that recommendations
favorable ,to paying off nncontested
c aims, or those 10 which no" doubt ex
ists of their justness, should be mude in
order that people who have acted in good
faith will retain their claims and know

REDDING GOLD STRIKE.
Body of Rich Ore Uncovered in the Re-
cently Abandoned U.c/e Sam
Mine.
REDDING, Cal., Nov. 17.â The famous
Uncle Sam mine, owned by the Sierra
Buttes Company, which was recently
closed as having "petered out," is again
coming to the front.
The Sierra Bnttes Company closed the
mine and has for the past month been
tearing out the machinery preparatory to
shirment. They leased the mine to a
couple of prospectors, who had iaith in
the property, and for three weeks these
two miners nave been industriously at
work searching fir a body ol ore they
thought was in the lode. They
have been rewarded for their labors
by discovering a larger and richer body of
ore tuan was ever worked in the mine,
and to-day it was said they will secure a
bond on the property and will eventually
make a sale.
The Uncle Sam was one of Shasti
County's greatest gold-producers and the
Sierra But es Company took out of its
works over half a million dollars above
operating expenses.
The news of t tie big strike was received
witn universal satisfaction in Redding, as
the Uncle Sam furnished the nucleus for a
considerable amount of business here.

Lively Betting at Merced on the Coursing
Contests That End
To- Day.
MERCED, Cal., Nov. 17. â To-day's
coursing on the plains west of Merced
supplied rare sport. The trials were very
heavy, eight out of ten bein â ; finished out of
sight of the spectators. With two or three
exceptions the bares took the dogs away
from two to three miles. There was not
Dominicfc Shannon, a Prominent
Coursing Enthusiast*
such a large number in attendance as yes
terday. This was due, no doubt, to the
rain that was falling fast when the coursers
left the town this morning; but by tne
time the coursing grounds were reached
the sky cleared.
The first and second ties were run down
in about four hours, leaving seven dogs
y>-t to contest. Betting was heavy all
through and to-night there was a lar>;e
number around the pool boxes, and money
was bein â Â» showered in.
In the tirst ties tooondyne beat Black

CUTING FOR STANFORD PLAYERS
Varsity Football Men Will Continue
Training at Con/jres* Springs,
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Nov.
17. â It was to-day decided by the football
management that the players should go
down to Congress Springs for the final
week of practice before the big intercol
legiate match, instead of leaving for Noo
nane>, a small mountain resort above
Woodside, as has.Deen done in the past
two seasons, on Walter Camp's advice.
.-a n. -factory arrangements could nor. be
made this year at the customary resort,
so it became necessary to select another,
and choice fell on Congress Springs. There
the men will be abie to put on the fin&l
toucues of their game without being both
ered with worrying questions as to the
players' health or condition from over
anxious and kindly meaning partisans.
There is another reason why such a trip
is especially necessary for the Stanford
players. Their Berkeley opponents have
the advantage ot practicing at a greater
elevation and the tendency is for their
wind to be stronger than Stanford's. It is
chiefly to overcome this advantage that
the Stanford men will be sent to the
mountain resort during this last week
prior to ThanKsgiving. Most of the men
are deli bted at the prosD ct of leaving
the campus for a few days. The team
will probably leave on Friday next.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 1896.
CLAIM THEY SAW
A FLYING AIRSHIP
Strange Tale of Sacramento
Men Not Addicted to
Prevarication.
Viewed an Aerial Courser as It
Passed Over the City
at Night.
Declare They Heard Voices of Those
Aboard Join d in Merry
Chorus.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Nov. 17.â A vast
amount of excitement was created among
residents in the outskirts of the city to
night by the appearance of what they
claim to have been an airship, which,
seemingly under perfect control, passed
over the city, going in the direction of
San Francisco. The sky was obscured by
heavy clouds and it was impossible to
ascertain the shaps and size of the aerial
conveyance, presuming it to be such, but
the onlookers followed its course by the
lights displayed, which were about twice
the briiliancy and size of an arc light.
In speaking of the appearance of the
reputed airship, an eye-witness of un
doubted veracity said: "When my atten
tion was called to ihe traveling light it
was, I should judge, about 1000 feet high,
but as it approached the city limits it
arose to probably an elevation of 2000 ieet.
When I first saw it it was approaching
from a northeasterly direction, and on ar
riving at the city limits it bore off to the
south until past the city, when it turned
toward the southwest as if resuming its
course toward San Francisco.
"When the airship passed over the
streetcar company's barn, a crowd of the
employes came out, and they claim that
they distinctly heard â¢people's voices sing
ing in a chorus, a rattling song, which
gradually died away in the distance. The
lights of this mysterious visitant were
visible for upward of thirty minutes, until
they passed out of sight." .
A lineman in the employ of the Postal
Telegraph service claims to have seen the
same visitant about 9 o'clock in the
viciaity of Suisun on Sunday evening.
The impression here seems to be that
some one has solved the mystery of aerial
navigation, and is conducting his experi
ments at night in order to escape imper
tinent curiosity.
Men in charge of East Park, which lies
outside the city limits, state that as the
airship passed over the park the voices of
men, who seemed to be disputing as to
whether they should cause their convey
ance to rise higher, could be hearti. The
lights then rose rapidly into the air and
passed on.
OREGON STREAMS MISING.
A'o Abatement of flood i in the Interior
of the State.
PORTLAND, Ob., Nov. 17.â A fierce
snowstorm raged over the Willamette
Valley last night and snow fell heavily
for hours. Such a blizzard has not been
seen for three years, and at this season it
is remarkable.
The Willamette River is still rising and
the water is spreading over tne lowlands
below the city and sweeping everything
beiore it. No trains came in on the North
ern or Southern Pacific to-day owing to
the flood. The wires are down on the
Northern Pacific line, and how serious the
washouts on that line are cannot be told.
Ttie Southern Pacific overland was sent
out to-night on the west side by way of
Corvahis and then across to Albany. The
Oregon Railway and Navigation and
Union Pacific trains cot in all right, but
the tracks on the Columbia RiVer are
threatened by high water. The flood has
torn out wires in all directions and com
munication with the interior of the Btate
is very difficult.
Several trestles have been washed out
by the flood, and the Grand Opera Com
pany, which was to have onened in Port
land to-night, is storm bound somewhere
between Kalama and Tacoma.. At Cottage
Grove, Or., several houses have been
washed away by the river and many fami
lies have been compelled to seek safety.
The railroad track Is impassable, and
there is no telling when trains can pass.
The few incoming travelers state that a
heavy snowstorm is raging up the valley
and regular blizzard weather prevails.
At Salem a preat deal of damage is re
ported in the Mill Creek Valley and adja
cent territory.

Strange Story of a San
Diego Millionaire's
Last Hours.
Friends Kept From His Door by
a Negro Who Guarded
the Entrance.
Passes Away Ignorant of the Fact
That One of His Daughters
Had Married
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Nov. 17.â A strange
story was unearthed to-day as a result of
the filing of a copy of the will of Nimrod
Lancaster, deceased. Lancaster was a
Chicago millionaire, and was 83 years old
when he died. He left the United States
a poor man, and returned from South
Africa within two years worth almost a
million, much of it in diamonds. He was
a great lover of diamonds, and when he
died had a lot of gems, one of them re
puted to be worth $25,000.
The old man came to San Diego in 1891,
seeking relief from rheumatism. He in
vested in property here, including a
mortgage on the new Carleton Hotel. He
returned in 1894, bringing his pretty neice,
Miss Bessie Wallace.
The girl fell in love with a young bank
clerk, and the old man became so enraged
that he ordered her to pack up and return
to Chicago. The girl instead went to
Oceanside, and about that time the clerk
disappeared, too. When they returned
the story leaked out that they had been
married at sea.
The old man forgave the girl, and she
managed to keep the story of her marriage
irom his ears. He gave her diamonds
worth $35,000, and she pave one of the
rings, a superb diamond, to her husband,
who wore it until the diamonds were
called in by the old man's administrators
on the ground that the title had not
legally passed from him.
The old man became very ill, and on
June 8, 1894, another niece, Mrs. Mary
Phipps of Indianapolis, arrived to look
after him. She discharged the physician
in charge and hired another. She placed
a negro porter at the door of old Lan
caster's room with positive orders to ad
mit no one but herself. The younger
niece easily gave in.
Lancaster, Knowing that he was about
to die, had sent, it is said, for the owner
of the hotel and made it known that h â¢
wished to surrender the mortgage in ex
change for kindness shown him. The
man went after his papers, and when he
returned found the patient in very bad
shape with his tongue swollen so badly
that he could not speak. As lie was try
ing to make signs of what he wanted, the
owner of the bouse was hustled out of
the room, on the ground that it was too
exciting .or the patient. So the old man
died, and the mortgage still holds good.
The day after Lancaster died Mrs.
Phipps left the New Carteton and soon
afterward left ihe city. In the East she
and her husband applied for letters of ad
ministration and got them. The ap
praisers of the estate fix d its value at
$850,000, consisting mostly of Chicago real
estate and diamonds. The young niece,
Miss Wallace, disappeared with the older
one and they took the old negro porter
with them.
The girl is mentioned in the will as re
ceiving one-fourth of the estate, but Mrs.
Phipps and her husband are not men
tioned. It is said that the girl is trying to
get back the diamonds.
Car, tain M-i/ifin Retire*.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 17.-Cap
tain Alfred T. Mahan, U. 8. N., was to
day placed on the retired list at his own
request after forty years of active service.
Captain Mahan would have been pro
moted to the rank of commodore in a
few months and could then have retired
with increased pay. It is thought that he
must have been forced to act now by
reason of pressing literary engagements.
Captain Mahan has a good record as an
officer, but has a wider reputation as the
writer of one of the best naval histories in
existence.

A Thie.'Â» Oue. r Booty.
Sanford E. Thompson of Newton
mourns to-day the loss of a package of
butterflies aiid beetles from India, which
some thiei stole from Bishop's express
wagon while it was being driven in from
Newton last night.
The package stolen contained five boxes
of rare insets' ts which had been collected
in India. Very likely the thief was dis
gusted when he found what he had taken,
and it is unlikely that he will make any
attempt to dispo-e of the articles, as they
are not readily salable, and the police
were notified of the theft last night.
Some of the insects were the property of
Mr. Thompson, while others had been
placed in his keepin by a friend who had
collected them in India. Any restitution
the express company can make would not
compensate Mr. Thompson for the loss of
the rare beetles, and he expects never to
see them again, as the thief probably
would tnrow them awa} f when he found
he could not dispose of them readily.
The collection represents a vast amount
of work in India and to duplicate it
might be the wort of years.â Boston

Napoleon's Arm; in 1813.
In order to arm and equip the men
raised by conscription Napoleon had re
coursp to his private treasure, drawing
55,000,000 francs from the vaults of the
Tuileries for that purpose. Tne remain
ing ten were transferred at intervals to
B ois; but all his treasure could not buy
what did not exist. The best military
stores were in the heart of Europe; the
French arsenals could afford only anti-
Quated and almost usele-s supplies. The
recruits were armed sometimes with shot
guns and knives, sometimes with old
muskets, the use of whfch they did not
know; they wore for the most part bon
nets, blouses and sabots. There were not
half enough horses for the scanty artillery
and cavalry. Worse than all there was no
time for instruction in the mannal and
tactics. On one occasion a boy conscript
was found standing inactive under a fierce
musketry fire; with artless intrepidity
he remarked that he believed he could
aim as well as anybody if he only knew
how to load his gun!â Sloane's "Life of
Napoleon" in the Century.
To keep the 30,000-odd miles of telegraph

Waters Slowly Receding
in the Northern Flood
Districts.
Irreparable Damage to Growing
Crops in Oregon and
Washington.
Railway Lines Still Blocked by Slides
and Washoutsâ Two Deaths
by Drowning.
SEATTLE. Wash., Nov. 17.â 1n some
sections of the flooded district, notably
the Skagit and Snohomish rivers, the
waters are slowly receding, but they have
not fallen enough to give material relief.
Small rivers south of this city, in King
County, are still rising and great loss to
private property is the result. Much of
the oat crop, for which the Skagit River
bottoms are famous, has been irreparably
damaged, and baled hay in great quanti
ties has been washed down the rivar and
hundreds of bales on into the sound.
From the north reports come of the
drowning of about fifty head of cattle and
many more sheep, bogs and horses. It 13
estimated that over 1,000,000 feet of logs
and shingle bolts have been washed down
tbe various streams emptying into the
tound.
The river steam boat City of Champagne,
Captain McConald, has returned from a
perilous trip up the Skagit. Captain Mc-
Donald says the voyage was attended by
the greatest danger, the vessel being re
]>eatedly struck by floating trees and logs.
He reports that the water bed risen
around many large grain warehouses~to a
depth of five or six feet.
At Mount Vernon the water fell four
feet to-day. Sedro reports six houses
washed from their foundations, and at
Hamilton, a small town in Skagit County,
a large brick residence collapsed and sev
eral more dwellings were badly damaged.
During the day the water fell five feet in
Snohomish City, but the tracks of the
Great Northern Railroad are still sub
merged around the towns of Lowell, Mon
roe and Wallace. There was a fall of
about four ieet to-day at Everett.
There is but little improvement in the
general railroad situation. No overland
trains are running in any direction,
though the Northern Pacific will make
another attempt to-night to take a train
east over tbe Cascades, hoping to transfer
at Natchez Rivei. Its lines between this
city and Tacoma are in a bad way. The
White River bridge is out and several
landslides still block the way. On Thurs
day, it is expected, trains will be run from
Tacoma and Portland. The Seattle and
International ran a train north to Sumas
this atternoon, affording connection with
the Canadian Pacific That road's local
agent reports that an overland loft Van
couver for tbe East to-day, and that west
bound overlanda are moving again. By
to-morrow the Great Northern expects to
have a train running as far north as Stan
wood on the coast line.
The Western Union and Postal Tele
graph wires are again in fairly good shape,
but no mails have been received in this
city for three dajs, save by boat from local
points.
William Davidson and John Larson
were drowned last night while trying to
rescue a man from an island in the Yakima
River.
WHIT TIER EX-EMPLOYES ACCUSED.
Warrants Issued for Three Women Charged
With Brutality to the
Inmates.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Nov. 17.âWar
rants have been issued for the arrest on a
charge of battery of Mrs. Wilson, Miss
Germain and Mrs. Henderson, who were
employed in the female ward of the Whit
tier Reform School. Mrs. Sutherland, the
discharged night watebwoman in the
girls' dormitory, caused criminal proceed
ings to be instituted against tbe others.
She claimed to tne District Attorney that
tuese women abused the girls.
Mrs. Wilson was principal and Miss
Germain was matron until last week,
when they were discharged. According
to tbe statements of Mrs. Sutherland,
these two compelled the girl inmates to
starjd still for four hours at a time. Rosa
Johnson was whipped and put into a
straitjacket and locked in a cell. Lizzia
Robinson and Siella Martinez were
whipped and put into strait jackets for
laughing over pictures in a magazine.
These wbipDings were administered with
broad strap;. Mary Kavanaugh ana Mary
Gray were put in straitjacEets and
locked in cells for gijrgling. Their feet
were tied and cloths were tied over their
months.
Mrs. Sutherland claims that Mrs. Hen
derson was in the habit of putting girls
into lockers over night. All this began
the iauer part of September, and Mrs.
Sutherland says she wrote to John W.
Mitchell to corae and investigate. The
warrants have not been served yet, as it is
expected the three officials will surrender
themselves.
COLLISION AT EUREKA.
The Tug Jig nger and Schooner Oceania
Vance Crath Together.
EUREKA, Cal., Nov. 17. â The tug
Ranger went outside the bar to-day to tow
in the schooner Oceania Vance, bound to
this port to load lumber for Sydney. When
the tug was nearing the schooner, the lat
ter suddenly made a tack, coming onto the
tug before her captain realized his danger.
The schooner's jibboom swept the upper
works of the tug, taking out the mast and
rigging and smokestack, and demolishing
the whistle and steam-pipes. Connections
with the boiler were broken and >team es
caped so rapidly that the tug was forced to
mate for harbor, which was reached safely.
The tUÂ£ Buhne went to the assistance,
but her services were not necessary. The
bar became very rough ssortly afterward
and the schooner was uanble to get in and
her damages cannot be ascertained until
she reaches port to-morrow.
The Zinita May He Saved.
TACOMA, Wash.. Nov. 17.-A private
dispatch from Hoquiam says the bark
Zinita, which was wrecked near Grays
Harbor, may be saved. Captain Frager
will at once begin to clear the rigging to
the lower masts, and says he can lighten
the vessel to draw only seven feet of water
ahe captain says the Zinita is fully in
sured.
Fight at the Jfremton Mint.
EUREKA, Cal., Nov. 17.â Word was
received in this city to-night of a fight
which occurred at the Preston coal mine
in this county yesterday. Mat Hulmlund
was having an argument with another of
the crew, when George Williams, cook for
the crew, took part, angering Hulmlund.
The latter tola Williams to attend 10 hi 6
pots and pans. This enraged Williams so
that he ru-hed into the kitchen, seized a
heavy frying-pan, returned to where
Hulmlund was standing and struck him a
fearful blow on the head with it, crushing
his skull. The chances lor Hulmlund's
recovery are slight.
DROWNED IN TEN-MILE RIVER.
Mendocino Stage Driver Gallops His
Horses Into a Swollen Stream
at Night.
CAHTO, Cal, Nov. 17. â George
Thomas "Old George" as he was familiarly
known â night driver of the Eureka
overland stage, was drowned in Ten-mile
River early yesterday morning while
en route with bis stage to Cummings,
fifteen miles north of here.
The river at the ford is always a shallow
gravel bed during the early fall and sum
mer months, but the heavy rains of
Saturday and Sunday have swollen all
the streams. Thomas had forded this
stream twenty-four hours previously and
doubtless had no thought of impending
danger. The horses evidently galloped
into the river where twenty feet of water
was rushing at the rate of twelve miles an
hour. The torrent probably carried all
down tbe stream, as no evidence of
wreckage remained.
information from the driver of the
south-bound stage arriving here to-day
at 1C o'clock to the effect that he had not
passed Thomas en route or heard any
thing of his whereabouts aroused tha
citizens of t bis vicinity and a r ireful
search was instituted, with the result that
Thomas' body was found nearly two miles
from the point where he had attempted
to cross. It was considerably mangled
from violent contact with 'the rocks. Tbe
horses were found alive 300 hundred yards
from the ford, standing in five feet of
water. They were entangled in the for
ward running gear of the stage and had
remained in this condition for over thirty
hours. The stage and contents are a
total loss. Two pouches of United States
mail are missing, and the remaining five
or six pouches are so watersoaked that
the mail inclosed cannot be routed on
account of its unreadable condition.
The watch stopped at 3:50 o'clocc Mon
day morning, and at this hour two shrill
calls were beard by persons living in the
vicinity of the foru. Thomas had been in
the employ of the stage company four
years. He was unmarried, 53 years of
ace, and had no known living relatives.
He had always been regarded as a trusty
man, and was ever sober and careful.
McLACHLAN MAY CONTEST.
Friend* of the Congressman Claim That
,; : ';V,. He Wmm Fairly Elected.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Nov. 17.â Friends
and advisers of Hon. James McLacnlan
insist that he will contest the election of
Barlow for Congress in this district. In this
county alone there is a difference of 2341
between the Presidential and Congres
sional vote, and in the entire district
there is a shortage of at least 4000 votes
for Congress. Election officers say this
discrepancy is hirpeiy accounted for by
double voting for Congress, the names of
McLachlan and Needham, Prohibitionist,
being marked on the same ballot, hence
neither counted. Actual tests show that
the folding of a freshly marked McLarh
lan ballot makes a. plain imprint after
Needham's name. It is claimed McLach
lan lost many votes in this way. He has
not yet decided to contest, but is seriously
contemplating such action.
LOS ANGELES STRIKE.

LOS ANGELES, Cal., Nov. 17.â The
curtain did not rise at the Burbauk The
ater to-night, where the Ideal Opera Com
pany has been holding forth. The cause
of the shut-down was a strike on tbe part
of several members of the company be
cause Manager Malim could not accede to

former engagement. Miss Gracie Piaisted,
the star of the company, was lor .eoing on
with the performance, ana seems much

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 1896.
PROOF THAT ROE
TOLD THE TRUTH
Movements of the Suspect
in 1891 Traced by the
Prosecution.
Statements in His Concession ot
the Greenwood Murder
Verified.
The Case for the Peopls Closed in
the Trial of the Napa
Prisoner.
NAPA, Cal., Nov. 17.â The confession
of William Roe, alias William Moore, on
trial for the murder of Mrs. Greenwood in
IS9I, mas repeated on the witness-stand
to-day by Sheriff Burr of Los Angeles.
Beyond the testimony of this otlicer and
of Sheriff McKenzie the prosecution de
voted its time to tracing the whereabouts
of Roe in 1891 to prove that bis move
ments were aa he stated in the confession.
The courtroom was again crowded to-day
and the prisoner manifested more than
Uauul interest in tbe proceedings, ire
quently con.enmg with his attorneys.
The prosecution closed its case in the
afternoon.
Mrs. Weyse, who had testified last Fri
day, was called for further cross-exatuiua
tion when court opened this morning.
She said she did not expect any portion of
the reward offered for the apprehension
of the murderer of Mrs. Greenwood.
Moore toid her that he had owned a faise
beard, which cost $'2 50, but after the mur
der of Mrs. Green wood he had destroyed it.
This testimony was important, inasmuch
as Policeman Johnson of Los Angeles
identified Roe as a man whom he arrested
in August, 1892, for battery. The fellow
wore a false beard and gave his name as
George Knight.
Sheriff John Burr of Los Angeles County
made a clear statement of what was told
him by Moore relative to the murder. He
said he met Moore for the tirst time on
September 21 on the train from San Ber
nardino to Los Angeles. After arriving
in Los Angeles Moore wafÂ» taken to the
Sheriff's office and his voluntary state
ment in reference to the Greenwood mur
der was made iv substance as follows:
I am Bill Moore, wanted in Napa County for
the murder oi Mrs. Greenwood. The day be
fore tfefl murder 1 met Carl Schmidt and saw
that he was a man that 1 couid handle. On
the way up from Valk-jo weâ Schmidt and 1â
stopped and dranlc ai different saloons and
arrived at the Greenwood place about 5
o'clock in the afternoon. After a conversa
tion with Mr. Greenwood we went into the
house. About twenty minutes laier Mrs.
Greenwood returned home. 1 helped Mrs.
Greenwood out of the buggy and into the
house, while Schmidt took caro oi the horse.
We then went into the house.
Mrs. Greenwood eofci plained of trouble In
her head and l gave her some medicine that I
had. Greenwood and I then had a iuss and
we both drew our pistols. I shot Mr. Green
wood in the left cheek, the bullet glancing
and Willing .Mr.-. Greenwood. I then went out
to Schmidt and we got into the buggy and
drove to XÂ»Â»>a.
We again returned to the Greenwood place,
Schmiut going into the house and 1 remaining
on the outside. We then left the Greenwood
place. I gave Schm.di $3 or $4 and told him
to go his way aua I wouiu go miue. He
started toward Sacramento and I toward Be
nicia. At Benicia, the day after the murder, I
went into a saloon and treated a worklngman
to a drink. Some one remarked, "There goes
the Sheriff; I wonder what he wants here."
1 procured a pair of overalls lrom the bar
tender and a dinner-bucket from a man. As I
was leaving the saloon I met the Sheriff. I
again entered the saloon and took a drink
with the officer. I then went to San Fran
cisco.
This statement was made to Sheriff Burr
while in Los Angeles and iv the train en
route to Fresno. The Sheriff said that
Moore was very much worried, and at
times could not keep from crying. He
was much depressed in spirits, and said
Schmidt was suffering punishment for a
crime of which he was innocent. To pass
away the time while on the train Moore
recited selections from several authors â
Scott, Burns and Byron.
Sheriff McKenzie went upon the stand,
and his testimony corroborated that of
Sheriff Burr, Moore haying toid the same
story to Sher-ff McKenzie and Sheriff Burr.
Moore was met at Fresno by Sheriff Mc-
Kenzie, and from that place to Napa, con
versation was held between the Sheriff
and the defendant. According to the
testimony of Sheriff McKenzie, Moore told
the following story in connection with
that given by Sheriff Burr:
When weâ Schmidt and Iâ got to the Green
wood place we saw tracks leading from the
gate. We saw Greenwood cutting borne wood.
He would give us no food or money, ana I had
bad blood for him. We took Greenwood into
the house. When Mrs. Greenwood returned I
helpfld her into the house. As she complained
of a headache, I gave her come medicine I had
with me.
After the crime was committed we went to
the Germau House in Napa and inquired for
Knox. Alter returning to the Greenwood
house we went toward Cordelia. Schmidt
started toward Benicia. I hid my overcoat
and pistol under a biidge. I then crossed the
water on the boat Solano and went to the
What Cheer House in San Francisco. From
there 1 went to Bakersfield and the southern
portion of the State.
Mrs. Weyse was again recalled by the
defense. She testified that two months
subsequent to the time she heard the con
fession of William Moore she received a
letter from Moore explanatory of the con
fession. The testimony was objected to
on i he part of the prosecution on the
ground that the time of reviewing the
testimony was too remote from the time
the confession was made. The objection
was sustained.
Julius Desdier, who was proprietor o
the California Hotel, at the corner of Cali
fornia and Kearny street in 1891, testified
that Moore had stopped at his place on
January 27, 1891. This testimony was
stricken out as toovague. Martin Kerr,
who has had charge of the What Cheer
House in San Francisco, said that Moore,
under the name of William Smith,
stopped with him on February 10, 1891.
C. L. .Johnson, a policeman of San Fran
cisco, testified that in 1893 the defendant
had in his possession a false beard. The
te-timony was stricken out, as it was given
too long after the commission of the mur
der. This closed the case for the prose
cution.
The defense asked for further time, and
court adjourned until to-morrow morning.

ance companies. Tlie alliance believer, it
has a right to take fire risks, thus keeping
the money among the members and help
ing them along.
Thomas V. Cator, attorney for the alli
ance, was in attendance and stated that
while he was fully assured in his own
mind that if the matter was brought be
fore the Supreme Court a decision would
be rendered in favor of tbe alliance, still
there could be no doubt but that tbe alli
ance would have to contend with adverse
legislation during the coming session in
case tbe subject was brought before the
Supreme bench, so it was concluded to
make no further contest.
The alliance has a number of co-opera
tive schemes on hand, all of which are
under d is. <usf-ion. One in particular is the
f stabhshing of a tannery with a new sys
tem of caring bides; but while discussion
on these questions have taken a wide range,
nothing i.efinite has been decided upon.
At the session to-morrow it will prob
ably be decided to convert all sub-alliances
into county alliances, to meet quarterly.
As yet no committee has been appointed
10 draft resolutions, and possibly none will
be selected. It is believed that the alliance
will decide to indorse certain bills in favor
of labor organizations now pending before
Congress, notably one favoring the sailors'
union.
UTAH BALLOTS CAST FOR NAUGHT
Recent Election Declared by a County
Attorney to Have Been Uncon
stitutional.
SALT LAKE, Utah, Nov. 17.â County
Attorney Whittemore in an opinion made
to the County Commissioners, sitting as a
board of canvassers checking election
returns, says the recent election in this
State was unconstitutional. The consti
i tution provides that elections shall be by
secret ballot, while the election law passed
by the last Legislature made it imperative
that the judges of election should number
each ballot, the figures being placed on
the corner of the Australian ballot, tbe
corner then being turned over and sealed
I with mucilage, not to be opened except in
I case of a contest. This, the attorney says,
is contrary to the provisions of the consti
tution, and as the judges all over the
State followed the law he maces the rul
ing stated.
Should the case be carried to the courts
and bis judgment be sustained it means
that the three electors, the Congressman
and the members of the next Legislature,
together with every county and prec.net
[ ofiicer in the State, would hold over until
j a new election law could be passed by tne
old Legislature convened in special ses
sion, and also that no United States Sena
tor would be chosen this winter. The
election was so overwhelmingly Demo
cratic, however, that it is not believed
likely that any movement will be made
for political reasons pure and slmp'e,
because public sentiment here is decidedly
against such procedure.
On Trial at ban Jose.
BAN JOSE, Cal., Nov. 17.â The trial of
R. B. Fox. on a charge of attempting to
murder Deputy Constable Lane at Los
Gatos several months ago, began in Jud.e
Lorigan's court to-day. Fox, who had

released from jail on condition that he
would leave town. He returned after a
few days, and was lying in wait with a

Xot Anaelet Damage ftutt.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Nov. 17.â Tbe
trial of a suit for $40,000 damages, brought
by Julius Kolbig atalnst tbe Southern
Pacific Railroad Company, was begun in
the StiDenor Court to-day. Kolbig states
that in 1889 Los Angeles River overflowed
its banks, breakm? through a levee and
damaging the old Nadeau winery property,
of which he then had possession. The
cause of this overflow, the plaintiff alleges,
was negligence in the construction oi a
bridge across the river by the Southern
Pacific, so that it proved an obstruction to
the rush of waters.

BOON FOR LINDA
VISTA DISTRICT
Wright Act Decision Acts
as an Impetus for
Improvements.
Capital Ready for Investment
in Irrigation System
Schemes.
The Only Obstacle Is the Possibility
of a Continuance of
Litigation.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Nov. 17-â Tbe
Linda Vista irrigation district baa taken
on new life since the United States
Supreme Court's decision sustaining tbe
Wright law. Already telegrams have
been received by the directors offering 10
negotiate for the bonda of tbe district,
and Colonel J. P. Jones, one of the di
rectors, said this morning that there was
capital now waiting and ready to take
hold of the district bonds, build the dam
and construct a water s-ystem aa fast as
j men and money couid do it. Colonel
Jones said:
â¢ lucre is but one obstacle in tbe way.
Some of the large land-owners on whom
the tax will fall rather heavily at tirst may
not stop to think of the untold advan
tages to be derived from ths final settle
ment of this question by the highest
tribunal in the land, and may wish,
therefore, to try to tie up matters for a
still longer period. This they can do if
they want tdf and while tbe result would
be against them inevitably in tbe long
run, still some one may throw this into
the courts.
"However, I feel much better since I
had a conversation with Mr. Boal of the
San Diego Land and Town Company,
which owns 5000- or 6000 acres in Linda
Vista. Mr. Boal cays, if we can secure
capital to go ahead and work, that his
company will walk up to tbe counter and
pay its pro rata. As the Land and Town
Company is the largest owner in the dis
trict, I am satisfied mat all the others will
come around all right, lor we will have
the money to begin worK very shortly.
"The tirst thing to be done. I believe,
will be to begin work on the Famo dam.
When that is completed to the height of
154 feet it will be capable of impounding
from 3000 to 3500 inches of water, sufficient
to last the district for many years to come.
This dam is twenty-four miles by wagon
road from here, and to build tbe dam to
tbe height indicated will cost now about
$240,000, although three years ago it would
have cost more than $300,000."
RIVERSIDE, Cal., Nov. 17.â The de
cision of the Supreme Court in the Wright
irrigation law case, while bailed with de
light by the bondholders of the irrigation
districts in this coumy, means confis
cation to the land owners, at least in the
Alessandro and Perris districts. In these
tbe bonded indebtedness amounts to such
a figure that land-owners cannot pay the
interest and the money to provide for a
sinking fund and expenses of tnÂ« district.
More than this, the irrigation system is
Btill incomplete and it is out of the ques
tion to raise more money to continue tbe
work. The decision means that the inter
est and sinking fund must be provided
for, and many land-owners will be com
pelled to give up their land along with
years of labor and all improvements. The
only hope for the people is that tbe courts
may declare tbe bonds invalid because of
irregularity of issue and the failure of the
Bear Valley Company to keep its con
tracts with tbe people.

sands of dollars, but as his fortune de

mortgage was never paid and the property
fell into the hands of the mortgagee. The

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 1890.
VACANT HOUSES
FOR BURGLARS
An Epidemic of Pilfering
Is Now Prevailing
Here.
Crimes Committed by One Man,
or the One Set of Men,
All Over Town.
Residences in the Well-to-Do Parts of
the City Entered and J welry
and Money Stoen-
The burglar with the vacant house
"graft" has reappeared and is giving
Captain Lees and "the upper office" an
opportunity for much thinking.
Tnis particular criminal, or a "co-ed" of
his, made his appearance in this City
about a year ago. Like every other grad
uate or understudy for the penitentiary,
lie has his own way of working.
He selects some vacant building abut
ting upon an occupied house in some
well-to-do neighborhood. This he enters
from the rear, usually by breaking a pane
of glass and opening a window. Then he
Â£oes into the front room of the upper
story of the house, which is usually orna
mented with a bay window, and watches
until the family next door goes out and
until the policeman on the beat goes by.
Then be opens one of the bay windows,
-teps upon tne balcony leading to the
window ol the occupied house and plun
-iers it ai his leisure.
Last Fr;day evening this vacant house
â¢-raft burglar entered a nouse to let on
Sutter street, between Buchanan and
Webster, and while the police were cbang
injt watch at about 6 p. m. and in the ab
-ence of the family entered the resi lence
1534 Sutter street "and bagged $300 worth
of jewelry and about $65.
On the next night he entered a dwelling
on McAllister street, near Steiner, and trot
away with several hundred dollars' worth
<f money and jewelry, including an ele
gant set of silverware.
The thief loft no clew behind him save
in open window, which for purposes of de
tection, was of no more value than a
closed door. It was evident, however, that
hese and other burglaries were the work
if one man or the same set of men.
On Monday ni^nt an attempt was made
:o break into the house at 614 Hyfe street.
The burgjlar had forced open a window in
lie rear and the noise alarmed the occu
pants. They made an investigation and
seeing the open window notified the po
! cc. The burglar hearing them moving
about beat a hasty retreat.
N. J. Lund's hotel, Sixteenth and Fol
som streets, was entered by a burglar
arly Sunday morning. Nine bedrooms
were visited, and the burglar succeeded in
rifling the pockets of the occupants with
>ut disturbing them, except in one in
tan cc.
A. Trouse was awakened about 3 o'clock
tn the morning by a noise in his room.
He saw a man crawling out of the room
>n his hands and Knees, but strange to say
c did not sound an alarm. The burglar
got away with about $30 in coin, a check
. >t $50 and some jewelry. Two gold watch js
vere taken from a room occupied by a po
iceman, ana what worries him is that the
I idy's watch belonged to his sweetheart.
An investigation showed that the burg
r obtained access to theÂ» rooms by insert
ng a pair of nippers* in the keyhole and
urning the key. Detectives have been
vorking on the case, but so lar no arrest
i is been made.

Among the many mining men now here is Thomas Couch, manager of the
Butte and Boston and Boston and Montana companies, operating great mines
and smelters at Butte and Great Falls. Mr. Couch is also developing large mines

THE TAYLOR MINE.
Being Kxperted for a Syndicate of ton
don Cap talisto That Want- to Bay It.
The well-known Taylor mine, twelve
miles north of Pladervill^, in El Dorado
County, owned by W. S. and Washington
Chapman of this City, has-been experted
recently for London capitalists and is said
to bp as cood as sold.
The Taylor is a rich, steady-producing
gold property and for a long time has
paid regular dividends. It is one of the
best equipped mines in the State, having
a large plant of machinery and being
lighted with electricity. There is a forty
stamp mill on the mine.
The price of the property is given at
$500,000. For two weeks past William A.
Farish, the noted expert of Denver, bas
been examining the mine for the English
capitalists. He was cabled )rom London
to come on here. Mr. Farish is now in
this City. The other experts on the mine
for the British capitalists are Bell of Lon
don and Hamilton of California.
Charles McDerraott has been making
the sale. De Fries of London is one of
the buyers. The Chap mans have been
steadily developing the property for five
or six years. There is a bie body of ore
in sight, and it is said to be high grade.
Mr. Farisb, the Coloradd exoert, form
erly lived in California and operated
mines here. For several years, however,
he has been connected with large mining

I operations in Colorado. Ha is credited
I with being one of the best judges of a mine
in the West. Probably there are few in
the country who stand higher as an ex
pert.
Many mining men are here now from
different pans of the country, examining
j different gold mines. Some are experts
| and others are capitalists, a number of
| wiiora are owners of paying properties m
mountain mining States. Colorado is
well represented, as are Montana and
Utah.
British investors are just now giving un
; usual attention to California gold mines.
Apparently not for more than ten years
j has there been such an interest.

THE: CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL. "T
Irrigation is all right.
It looks like prosperity all round.
The arid districts are in the iwim.
It is pretty safe to prophesy a wet win
ter.
All things seem to be coming our way at
once.
The San Jose poultry show ought to
boom tlie industry.
The Supreme Court knows common
sense as weil as law.
They are talkine of nothing in the East
but chrysanthemums, horses and football.
The German crisis crawled into a gimlet
boie, but Bismarck is still on the outside.
In some parts of the East there la snow
8 foot deep and still it is not winter time
yet.
As a cabinet-maker McKinley has sense
enough to attend to his own job and he
is doing it.
We call it a storm out here, but in the
East it would have passed for a brisk wind
and a good shower.
Tbe Dingley revenue bill must be passed
this winter. A billion-dollar country needs
a billion-dollar tariff.
Prosperity and good wages are surely
coming, but, all the same, don't spend
your money until you get it.
ThÂ«; only way to bring about tbe appoint
ment of a Secretary of Mines and Mining
is to keep up the tight for it.
If the Assessors' convention does' its
work well we may look for tax reform
from the Legislature this winter.
The announcement that we are really to
have a competitive telephone system will
incline everybody to exclaim, ''Hello!"
The Puget Sound country 13 the place
where it never rains but it pours, and they
don't think anything of being in the swim.
While the work of charter-making is
1o go slowly it should also go steadfastly.
If there is to be no hurry there should be
also no negligence.
The funding bill light might as wel 1
come up this winter as at any other time.
California is as well prepared to fight it
new as she will ever be.
There is one thing to be said to the
credit of David Bennett Hill: His silence
is setting an example which every Demo
crat would do well to follow.
We are in favor of no booms on the Pa
cific Coast this time. Legitimate business
can employ all our money, all our energy,
and it pays best in tbe long run.
Bryan's talk in the campaign showed he
had no experience in business, and from
the way business is talking now it seems
clear that it wanted no experience with
him.
Boston has not yet positively refused
the Dancing Bacchante. She is at present
considering whether the freedom of the
art is not atoned for by the freedom of the
gift.
Maryland thinks she ought to have a
place in McKinley 1 s Cabinet but at tnis
distance it seems sbe ought to be suf
ficiently Droud of having got a place in
the McKinley column.
The decision of toe Supreme Court main
taining the validity of the Wright act is
of great benefit to California and may be
counted among the events of the season
that tend to prosperity.
Now that Weyler has begun to force the
fighting in Cuba it seems clear the end
cannot be far off, and if the Cubans can
only hold out during the winter their in
dependence will surely come in the spring.
Some loyal natives in Bengal decided to
erect a statue to Victoria and the British
public was delighted. The statue has re
cently been unveiled, disclosing a ring in
each nostril of the Queen, and the British
public is disgusted.
Alexander H. Clay, the unknown who
has just been elected to the United States
Senate from Georgia, is said to be Hoke
Smith's man, which is perhaps the poorest
introduction to the American people he
could possibly have.
The revival of industry following the
election of McKinley enables us to fore
cast what will result from the adoption of
a new protective tariff and justifies the
belief that the era of prosperity now open
ing will surpass any we have ever known.
Ohio is discussing the best means of re
modeling and enlarging her Btate Capitol
and California, from experience with the
cost of repairs at Sacramento, can give
her the advice of an expert. The best way
to get a good job is to tear the old build
ing down and put up a new one.
In an address at the W. C. T. U. conven
tion at St. Louis Mrs. Katherine L. Stev
enson paid an eloquent tribute to the
power of the press and gave a just recog
nition to the services of the majority of
American newspapers in promoting the
cause of morality and social improvement.
The source from which this praise comes
augments its value and it will be duly ap
preciated by every journal that deserves
to share in it.
KEEP UP THE FIGHT.
Tbe movement started by the Miners'
Association to bring about the appoint
ment of a Secretary of Mines and Mining
should not be allowed to lag. The direc
tors of the association should at once com
municate with mining men in other sec
tions of the Union and organize for the
purpose of promoting their desire at the
coming session of Congress.
Interviews published by The Call show
that the sentiment of leading men in this
State is on the side of ttie miners. It is
not unreasonable to assume that the sen
timent in other States of the West is the
same. So long, however, as that senti
ment does not tend to action it will have
no effect. The only way to make it opera
tive is for the leaders in the movement to
organize for action and then call upon all
who sympathize with them to give a
hearty co-operation in the work.
The request of the miners is a reasonable
one. On a full consideration of the sub
ject, the weight of argument will be found
on their side. They have, therefore, noth
ing to fear from discussion. On the con
trary the fullest debate of the subject
would be for them a campaign of educa
tion. It would make Known to Congress
and to the people at large the claims of
this great industry upon the National
Government and its right to have those
claims supported by a representative in
the Cabinet.
If anything is to be done during the
winter session of Congress, now is the
time to organize for the contest. This
work must of course be done by the
Miners' Association acting in combination
with similar associations of other States.
Upon them, therefore, devolves the taking
of tbe first step in the periormance of the
task.
There ought to be no hesitation on the
part of the Miners' Association of Cali
fornia in taking the lead. They have just
met in convention, and have adopted a
resolution tersely declaring their desire.
The directors of the association have,
therefore, a right Â«o count UDon the full
support of their fellow-members if they go
forward. The leadership of California
will be followed by the whole of the
greater West, and the movement will soon
have sufficient force to compel the atten
tion of Congress. It is to be hoped that
this work will be done as soon as possible.
There is but one way to win, and that is
to keap up the fight and wage it aggres
sively from this time on.
THE IRRIGATION LAW.
There was joy over a wide region of
California yesterday when it was made
known that the Supreme Court had sus
tained the validity of the "Wright Irriga
tion act. To many sections of the State
the general welfare was almost dependent
upon that law, and had it been declared
unconstitutional their prospects for ad
vancement would hare been seriously
overclouded.
The prediction is made by all who are
acquainted with the situation in the semi
arid districts of the State that the de
cision marks the beginning of a new era
of prosperity. These districts include
some of the portions of California which,
under irrigation, will become centers of
its greatest wealth. It would have been a
loss to the whole State haci the law been
declared invalid. As it is, the whole
State wiil benefit and the rejoicing in the
districts directly affected will bd shared
by the people at large.
The benefits of the decision will be felt
at once. This is made evident by reports
published yesterday from various counties
in the State. In Colusa it is expected
that the great canal on which so much
money has been expended will now be
completed. In various portions of Ban
Diego County important works which
have been suspended while the validity of
the act was in doubt will be immediately
resumed. Other counties hardly less inter
ested than Colnsa and San Diego share in
the general hopefulness. It seems cer
tain, therefore, the decision will give an
impetus to work and the employment of
labor in localities where it is greatly
needed.
It. is not too much to say that the law
which authorizes extensive irrigation and
makes it possible in this State will also
aid materially in advancing other indus
tries. In many localities water which is
used for irrigation can be used also where
it descends from the foothills for operat
ing electrical machinery, and there will
thus be given a stimulus to the establish
ment of manufacturing plants in places
where otherwise they would be unprofit
able.
In this way the decision will have an in
direct effect upon the industries of the
State, hardly less beneficial than its direct
result upon the cultivation of the soil.
Taken altogether, the people of the State
have good reason to rejoice in the decision,
and when its results begin to be realized
it cannot be doubted that the satisfaction
will be almost universal.
AMERICAN SHIPPING.
It is announced that the Commissioner
of Navigation in his annual report to Con
gress will call attention to the urgent
need of increasing the shipping under the
American flag for the purpose of carrying
on American commerce, and that in doing
so he will lay special stress upon the con
dition oi the trade of the Pacific Ocean.
There can be no question that this is a
subject to which the attention of Congress
should be immediately and forcibly called.
Our trade on that great ocean is threat
ened not only by the development of Brit
ish steamship lines from Canada and
Australia, but also by the promotion of
steamships from Japan. It would be a
most absurd result if this country should
see the commerce of the western ocean
pass from its bands to that of countries so
much inferior in wealth, population and
energy.
It us to be regretted that the Commis
sioner of Navigation, who seems to under
stand so clearly the needs of our com
merce, should be one of those extreme
free-traders who can see no better way of
remedying the evil than that ef suggest
ing a bill providing for free ships. Euch
a bill would have the inevitable result of
causing a large proportion of American
shipping to be constructed in England.
The gain of our merchants, therefoie,
would be the loss of our shipbuilders, and
what might be profitable in time of peace
would be disastrous in war.
The United States needs an increase of
her ship-building industry as well as an
expansion of her commerce. We certainly
desire to see San Francisco become the
metropolis of the Pacific Ocean trade. We
desire to see that trade carried on under
the American flag, but we desire also that
every ship which flies that Hug shall have
been constructed in America, by American
capital, out of American material and by
the payment of American wages to Amer
ican labor.
The Commissioner of Navigation ob
jects to Senator Frye's bill now before Con
gress imposing discriminating duties on
all cargoes brought into the United Btates
by foreign vessels. He argues that if we
discriminate against foreign shipping
other nations may discriminate against
THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 1896.
ours. There may be some validity in this
objection, but, however great it may be,
discriminating duties would not be half as
objectionable as free ships.
Fortunately tbe ta3k of dealing with
tbe problem will not devolve upon free
traders. Ttia present Commissioner of
Navigation will go out of office with Mr.
Cleveiand and a protectionist will take his
place. We can thank him for his zeal in
calling attention to the urgent needs of
Pacific Coast commerce. What he says
will direct the attention of Congress to
the matter and we can count on the in
coming Republican administration to de
vise a means of promoting our shipping
industry on the sea without injuring that
of the shipbuilders on land.
THE CUBAN CRISTS.
It seems that the war in Cuba has
reached a crisis at last. Whether General
Weyler's forward movement has been
made of his own motion or whether he is
acting under orders from Spain it is clear
that the full force of the Spaniards in the
island is now bein^ exerted to crusn out
tbe rebellion at one blow.
Along with the reports of the activity on
the part, of the Spanish forces there have
come many of an extraordinary hostility
on the part of the Spanish Government
against the United States. It is even said
that the Spanish Minister at Washington
has declared that a war between Spain
and this country is not an impossibility.
These reports are undoubtedly exagger
ated, but none the less they serve to show
the mood in which Spain is now approach
ing the crisis in her relations to Cuba.
The Spaniards as a race are among the
proudest on earth. They are the least
likely to surrender when there is any pos
sibility of attaining success. This trait of
their character has been manifest all
through their history. It revealed itself
during the middle a^es in the centuries of
war with the Moors, and it startled all
Europe at the beginning of this century
by strengthening the Spaniards to resist
tlie aggressions of Napoleon.
The same trait appears to-day in the war
with Cuba. 1 Spaniards will not relinquish
that island as long as it is possible for
them to garrison a sincle foxtress or keep
a single warship off ttie coast. It would
be to them an extreme humiliation to sur
render to **Maceo. No Spanish Ministry
could hold power for a moment if it con
sented to the abandonment of the island,
except under the pressure of absolute ne
cessity.
It is this trait of the Spanish character
rather than anything in the circumstances
of the situation which renders it possible
for a war to occur between Spain and the
United States. A Spanish ministry might
be willing to provoke a war with us as a
means of getting out of the Cuban quarrel
without a loss of popular favor for them
selves, or of national prestice for their
country. Therefore while war is improba
ble it is not impossible, and the American
people ought to be on their guard against
any contingency.
THE DINGLEY BILL.
It is to be regretted that there is any
doubt of the passage of the Dingley tariff
bill at the coming session of Congress.
Every man knows that the deficit in the
National revenue is a serious evil, and
every man therefore who holds a seat in
Congress ought to be willing to vote for a
measure that will put an end to it.
We can understand why there should be
opposition to a protective tariff system
from men who conscientiously believe
that the welfare of the country would be
promoted by free trade. This bill, how
ever, does not devise comprehensive pro
tection. It is simply a measure of expe
diency. Its only object is to provide a
revenue for the Government. It is not in
tended to be permanent. No man ought
to have a seat in Congress who allows a
mere partisan antagonism to impel him to
vote against a measure of such a character.
Differences of opinion between protec
tionists and free-traders are radical, but in
one thing both must agree. The country
must have a revenue, and as it is a billion
dollar country, it needs a billion-dollar
revenue. We cannot reduce expenditures
to the uarrowlimits of the Wilson-Gorman
tariff. We need more money and we must
Lave it. The country expects this Con
gress to provide a revenue. The battle
over the enactment of a thoroughly com
prehensive protective system can be post
poned until the next Congress meets. For
the present the Dingley revenue bill will
sullice, but that much we must have.
A SAMPLE OF CONFIDENCE.
A few months ago one of the largest cities of
New York found it impossible to place its
bonds on fair terms. Since last week New
York City was offered ten times the $16,000,
--000 of bonds it called for, at a premium which
reduced Its rate of 3)Â£ to about 3 per cent. â In
dianapolis Journal.
One of the most encouraging signs of the
present business situation is that American
capital is taking hold ot American invest
ments. This was demonstrated both by the
bids for the recent issue of New York City
bonds end by the course of dealings on the
Stock Exchange.â New York World.
Money seems to be coming out of hiding
since election. Brooklyn has already made a
successful sale of bonds, and yesterday $180,
--000,000 sought investment In $16,000,000
worth of bonds in New York. Both principal
and interest of these bonds are to be paid in
gold, the interest at the rate of 3}.Â£ per cent-
Brooklyn Eagle.
Before election an issue of New York bonds
went begging lor bidders. The bonds didn't
improve any by keeping, but the public confi
dence did as soon as McKinley was elected,
and the bonds that nobody wanted at any
price when there was a possibility of Bryan's
election were bid for many times over, and at
a premium, when it was definitely known
that this danger was past.â Philadelphia
Times.
Now that the election is over and the cause
of honest money has triumphed, New York
has a loan of $16,000,000* subscribed for three
or four times over, and the wealth of the coun
try stands ready to take good municipal bonds
wherever they are offered. This state of affairs
shoe's the difference between confidence and
want of confidence, between an honest money
system and a proposed dishonest one.â Chicago
Times- Herald.

Letters From the People.
OUR CITY POPULISTS.
Were They "Wrecked" by Intrigue in
the Keccnf Election?
Editor San Francisco Cellâ Sir: I quite agree
with Senator Butler of North Caro.inn, chair
man of the National Committee oi the People's
party, in his address after the election "to the
people of the United States," in which he
reaches the conclusion that "the People's
party will be the nucleus around which patri
otic hosts must and will gather" in future
contests, notwithstanding the stubborn fact
that Hujuboldt County, which went Populist
two years ago, did give McKiniey 500 major
ity, and that Alameda County, which was
nearly Populist two years ago, as it then ap
peared, is now the banner county of the Re
publican party, and the further fact ihat San
Francisco, which had a Populist vote of more
than 6000 two years ago, now has less than
haif that number, according to the vote of
November 3.
Many "explanations" have been offered,
some claiming that tbe Populists refused to
"fuse," and others that the Democrats were to
blame. My own judgment is that both are
right. But I cannot agree with the view
taken by John M. Reynolds in a recent "expo
sition" in The Call, that the City Populists
were "wrecked" by intrigue, though I grant
that every man must jud*e according to bis
light aud his range of vision.
My chief reason for distrusting the judg
ment of Mr. Reynolds is the fact that he was
one of the most conspicuous and most strenu
ous advocates of a strict â¢'middle-of-the-road"
policy for the City Populists, and yet he re
ceived but 1332 votes, according to the re
turns, less than half the accredited Populist
vote. He at least should have received the
full vote of two years ago, about 6000, for he
not only was a "consistent" advocate of pure
politics, but a man well known throughout the
I'itya.sau advocate of municipal ownership.
His zeal for pure politics was not well re
warded.
"The heaviest blow struck" against "fusion,"
according to Mr. Reynolds, "was the nomina
tion of young Potter, a clean, square but
humble proprietor of a machine-shop," whose
"open, frank and honest face and tquare build
won him the nomination" over "the treasurer
of the telephone company," Mr. Eaton, by
just three votes in a convention of 104. As
Mr. Potter was "brought out" by Mr. Rey
nolds as a "true Populist," but was unknown
to the oia and active Populists of the City,
while Mr. Eaton was an old citizen ana had
served the City as Supervisor twenty years be
fore, when he worked hsrd to secure City
ownership of the Spring Valley Water Works
and had a clean record as a Supervisor and a
business man, while Mr. Potter had resided in
the City but three years and was not well
known, it was thought that Mr. Eaton, who
had fully indorsed the Dlat(orm adopted by
the City Populists, would be a stronger candi
date than Mr. Potter and that there could be
no hope of electing either of them if both re
mained as candidates in the Sixth Ward.
In view of these facts I took the responsi
bility upon myself of inviting Mr. Potter and
Mr, Eaton to appear before the campaign com
mittee, which is also the executive committee
ol the People's party, composed of twenty-one
members, all of them old members oi the
county committee, but only three of the com
mittee were favorable to Mr. Eaton. They
appeared before the committee, both being
present at the same time. Mr. Eatun was first
interrogated as to bis views and his standing
and "voting strength" as a candidate, nearly
every member of the committee taking part in
the examination, which iasted about an hour.
He was then excused and left the hall, when
Mr. Potter had the same chance to state his
views and availabUlty as a candidate and was
requested to remain in an adjoining room to
await the action of the committee. Imme
diately on his retirement n motion was made
to invite Mr. I'oiter to place his resignation in
the hands of the committee, and it was put
without debate and adopted by a lull ana
unanimous vote. AU this is v matter oi
record.
TfeJa is what Mr. Reynolds says in regard to
Mr. Potter's resignation: "These men who
hypnotized Buckley and others who attend to
the Spring Valley's business, and others who
were playing for Buckley's favor, directed a
series of annoyances, intimidations ami mis
representations against Potter's candidacy
after the convention adjourned and made tlie
matter so bothersome to him that the young
man resigned." Tlie eutire campaign, com
mittee knows how utterly false and misleading
is this statement made by Mr. Reynolds and
addressed "to the fiity thousand Populists of
California."
And who is John M. Reynolds? Is he com
petent to speak for the PoDUlists of Ban Fran
cisco? Mr. Reynolds is the "business man
ager" of the Socialist newspaper, published
in this City, and has not been connected with
the People's party here within the past six
years, so far as I have ever known, until a few
days before the municipal convention
raut- Ho then joined a club and came
In as a delegate to the convention.
His occupation is that of -merchant," dealing
in hardwood finishing and writing his views
on public questions for publication in the
newspapers, more especially on municipal
ownership, in most of which Populists agree
with him; but he does not seem to be quite
fair in dealing with Populists, and may be sus
pected of trying to make it appear that they
have been "wrecked."
To the Populists of California I desire to say
that they need not ieel worried over the "reve
lations" made by Mr. Reynolds, for they are
all of a piece with the Potter matter, over
wnich he is so much exercised. They will
readily see that he has not much standing
with the City I'opulists as their self-appointed
champion, if we may judge by the BiZ9 of his
vote of 133*2, and innke any allowance for his
â¢'personal following" outside of the People's
party. At first I thought no reply to Mr. Rey
nolds need be made, but as he'ls a skillful
manufacturer and made a plausible story
which mighj mislead Populists outside of Sau
Francisco, I have written this reply to him.

FROM PRIVATE TO PRESIDENT.
Philadelphia Times.
McKinley Is the only private soldier who has
befln elected to the Presidency, or seriously
thought of for that position. The oniy other
man who served as a private in the ranks of
the army who has been prominently discussed
a* a Presidential candidate was William R.
Morrisou of Illinois.
McKinley enlisted as a private in the ranks
of the Twenty-third Ohio Regiment, of which
General Rosecrans was colonel. R. B. Hayes,
who afterward became President, and Stanley
Matthews, who died as Judge of the Supreme
Court of the United States, were flekl olliccrs.
MoKinley rose to the rank of captain during
the war, and retired with the brevet of major
for special gallantry at Fishers Hill and Cedar
Creek.
It is an eloquent commentary on the bene
ficence of the greatest of free Governments
that a private soldier in the ranks of the army
can win bis way to the highest civil trust of
the world, and by the lurgest majority ever
giveu to a Presidential candidate.
MOST POPULAR WOMAN IN
MEXICO.
Mme. de Diaz, the wife of the President of
Mexico, Is not only the first iady of the coun
try, but is the most popular woman in the re
public, says a writer in the St. James Budget.
Senora Dona Carmen Romero Rubio de Diaz
is known among her people, from the man
sions of the rich in the brilliant capital to the
humblest hut on tne frontier, as Carmellia,
meaning "our little Carmen." Her popularity
ever increases, for each year sees a larger
number of good works dispensed by this gen
erous woman, who uses her power to improve
tbe lot of a long-oppressed and unhappy peo-
Mmc Diaz Jr., the Most Popular
Woman in Mexico.
pie. Mme. Diaz is often appealed to on behalf
of some one or other sentenced to long impris
onment or death. Official pardon is a delicate
power for any one to hold, and the President's
wife is naturally careful for the justice of her
case before she goes to her lord to plead for
executive clemency. But the President him
self is oi a forgiving nature and not infre
quently the pardon is granted. Neither the
President nor his wife attends the brilliant
but brutal bullfights, and in every way they
use their influence against the degrading spec
tacles. It is certain that he will entirely pro
hibit them as soon as public sentiment gives
any hope of upholding his wishes.
"Carmelita' 1 is the second wife of General
Porfino Diaz, and is in her thirty-third year.
She stands as a type of advanced Spanish-
American womanhood, find among other ac
complishments speaks English and French
with almost equal fluency. She is remarkably
well informed on current events, and her ad
vice Is often sought by her husband. Tho
President is 60 years oM, and is very proud of
li is fair young wiie. When their marriage
took place, in 1884, they took their wedding
tour through thi- Uniteii States. Her girlish
grace and simplicity of manner well match her
beauty. Her ancestry uatea far back into the
nobility of old Castile, aud tho evidences of
long culture are easily marked. It is plainly
apparent that a considerable part of the popu
larity of the President of the republic oi Mex
ico and the desire oÂ» the people" to keep him
in office are due to the general esteem for his
lovely wife.

bee into New Zealand a few years ago to secure
the fertilization of red clover, and the remark
; able success, are matters of record.' The bum
ble bees are needed with red clover because
I their proboscides are long . enough to gather
the pollen from the red clover blossoms and
pollenizo them, while those | of other bees and

not true of all clover, but of red clover."

ABSOLUTELY PUBE
THORNS FOR THE
SOUTHERN PACIFIC
La Rue Busy Weaving Them
Into a Crown for the
Railroad.
Will Ask the Governor to Aid
Him in the Pleasant
Task.
Legislation Necessary to Punish for
Infractions of the State Con
stitution.
Stimulated by the opposition of tae
Southern Pacific Company and its attacks
on the powerÃ and very existence of the
Railroad Commission of this State, Chair
man La Eve of that body lias been mak
ing a carelul and close study of the con
stitution and legislative acts defining the
powers of the commission, and some of
the results of his researches will be dis
played in the report of the commission to
be submitted to the Governor, and whicu
is now being prepared.
Some of the proposed legislation which
will be suggested in this document has
already been described in The Call, but
Mr. La Rue has since been indefatigably
at work to see wherein the hands of the
commission can be further strengthened.
In article XII of the constitution, defin
ing the powers and duties of the commis
sion, he has discovered three sections
which define certain acts of railroads to be
illegal, but for which offenses no penal
lies are attached. Tiiese sections read as
follows:
Sec. 19. No railroad or other transportation
company shall grant free passes, or passes or
tickets at a discount, to any person holding
any office of honor, trust or profit in this
State; and the acceptance of any such pass or
ticket by a member of the Legislature or any
public officer other than Railroad Commis
sioner shall work a forfeiture of his office.
Sec. 20. No railroad company or other com
mon carrier shall combine or make any con
tract with the owners of any vessel that leaves
port or makes port in this State, or with any
common carrier, by which combination or
contract the earnings of one doing the carry
ing are to De snared by the other not doing
the carrying. And whenever a railroad cor
poration shall, for the purpose of compet
ing with any other common carrier, lower
its rates for transportation of passengers or
freight from one point to another, such re
duced rates shall not be again raised or in
creased from such standard without the con
sent of the governmental authority in which
shall be vested the power to regulate fares and
freights.
Sec. 21. No discrimination In charges or
facilities for transportation shall be made by
any railroad or other transportation company
between places or persons, or in the facilities
for the transportation of the eamo classes of
freight or passengers within this State, or
coming from or going to any otner State.
Persons and property transported over any
railroad, or by any other transportation com
pany or individual, shall be delivered at auy
station, landing, or port, at charges not ex
ceeding the charces for the transportation oi
persons and property oi the same class, in the
same direction, to any more distant station,
port or landing. Excursion and commutation
tickets may be issued ac special rates.
Referring to section 19 Mr. La Rue said:
"Here we have a clause prescribing for
feiture of office for a certain offense in
which the briber is equally culpable with
the bribed, yet no penalty is fixed for the
punishment of the latter. This should be
remedied by a legislative act imposing a
fine on any railroad that is guilty of
bringing about an infraction of this section.
"In sections 20 and 21 we find certain
proscriptions, but no penalties fixed for
an infraction of them. Here, too, the
Legislature should come to the aid of the
commission and ot the people of the
State.
"The Governor's attention will, in all
probability, be called to these matters in
the forthcoming report of the commis
sion.
"It is certainly a most remarkable thing
to me that during the seventeen years of
the commission's existence the Legisla
ture has passed but two acts to assist
the board in carrying out its work, not
withstanding that there is great need of
such aid, and it is to remedy this state
of affairs that recommendations will be
made to the Governor."

OVERDUE VESSELS
GET IN AT LAST
The Walla Walla Led the
Way and Then Came
the Homer.
A Couple of Sailing Ships and
the Costa Rica Got In
Later On.
Some Anxiety Is Felt for the Safety of
the Whaler Beluga and Steamer
Alice Blanchard.
The first of the overdue fleet got in yes
terday. The Pacific Coast Steamship
Company's Walla Walla put inun appear
ance about 8:30 a. m. and an hour later
was tied up at Broadway wharf. It did
not take the passengers long to get ashore
and many a woe-begone looking female
heaved a sigh of relief as she stepped
upon the wharf. One and all asserted
that it was the heaviest storm they were
ever In, but Captain Wallace asserts that
it was only "just a stiff blow."
Soon after the steamer ltft the Sound
and was beaded for San Francisco the
wind began to blow with hurricane force.
The waves were kept down in a measure
by tne force of the wind, but the spray
blew in blinding sheets and the rain fell
in torrents. One of the boats on the star
board side was left with the plug in and
at 4 P. m., it was found to be almost full of
water. While the storm waa at its worst
an arctic owl blew on board from some
wbere and alighted on the gaff. In spite
of ihe pitching and tossing of the ship one
of the crew managed to creep out and se
cure it. The stranger must have been
b.own off shore and sought a rest for its
weary wings on the Walla "Walla.
Off Cape Blanco Captain Wallace was in
company with the collier Costa Kica.
The Walla Walla was just holding her
own under a slow Dell," while the Costa
Rica was "bucking into it" and burying
her bow, at every plunge, right up to the
deckhouse. Captain Mclntyre brought
his vessel in last night and says it was as
wet a trip as be has ever made.
The Homer, fifty-six hours overdue from
Coos Bay, got in during the afternoon.
Captain Jessen says -the force of the wind
was enormous, but that the sea was not
very heavy. The spray drenched the ship
from stem to stern, and the staterooms
and cabins were flooded. The steamer
had to be hove to, and when a slant came
she was again put full speed for port.
A little anxiety was felt over the Bark
Carrollton, thirteen days out from Nanai
mo, B. C, and the General Fairchild,
seventeen days oat from Seattle, but both
set all doubts at rest by getting in last
night. Outside of the report of heavy
weather and the loss of some sails, taere
was nothing special to report by either
master. Another arrival was the barken
ii:ie Archer from Honolulu. The run was
made in eJeven days, a wonderfully fast
passage. The storm that delayed the
south-bound fleet helped the Archer along
on her way borne.
Whaling men are looking anxiously for
the arrival of the steam whaler Beluga.
She ought to have been in a week apo, and
her owners are wondering what is detain
ing her. The Beluga, Belvedere and
Thrasher all passed out of Bering Sea in
company. The Belvedere got in on the 6th,
and the Thrasher on the 9th inst., but
still there is no word of the other ship.
The schooner C. H. Merchant, from Ever
ett with lumber, is also fully due. and the
reports of wreckage drifttng ashore on the
Oregon coast does not tend to allay the
owners' apprehensions.
Captain Merry of the Chamber of Com
merce thinks in a short time the training
ship Pensacola will be at anchor off Goat
Island, and that over 100 boys destined
for the navy will find a home aboard her.
There have been 109 enlistments, 95 per
cent of whom are Americans. The train
ing-ship is now being put in readiness at
Mfire Island.
The Pacific Mail Company is to have
additional dock room at the small wharf
between the Mail dock and Fremont-street
wharf. It will be extended 200 feet, and
will be connected with the Mai' dock by
means of an eievated passage way. Tlie
entrance to the new wharf will be by way
Of the present entrance, and in this wy
only one force of customs officials and
gate-keepers will be necessary.
The American ship S. P. Hitchcock has
gone to Mission Rock. There are so many
disengaged vessels in port and rates are
so low that the captain thought it better
to lay up for the winter.
The .British tramp steamer Amarapoora
is in trouble again. After loading she went
out into the stream, but as she had a con
siderable list to port, Lloyd's agents would
not allow her to sail. Yesterday Captain
Watson went out and inspected her and
the chances are that the yes el will have
to dock again to discharge some of her
freight and trim cargo. Besides an un
usually heavy cargo, the Amarapoora has
a deckload of horses and cattle for Central
American ports.
Captain Frazer of the .British ship
Zinita, that went ashore near Hoquiam, is
in hopes of getting the vessel off. She
went broadside on the beach, but latterly
the tides have moved her and she is now
bow on to the ocean. In the meantime
the crew is living on the beach in tents
and are not only lightenine the ship, but
are stripping her ol all her deck hamper.
When a favorable occasion occurs the tugs
will be sent for and Captain Frazer expects
to get his ship into deep water again.
MISS JEWETT'S WILL.
Property Bequeathed to the Mother of
the Testatrix.
The will of Anna S. Jewett was filed for

tire estate to testatrix's mother, Sarah

George Craig. Â» Marino Engineer,
Arrested for Petty Larceny.
George Craig, a marine engineer was
booked at the City Prison last night by
Detective Dillon and Policeman Crosbie
on the charge of petty larceny.
Craig has been wanted by the police for
several months. His scheme was to ad

that he was a Government inspector of
boilers. He would call upon the women
answering the advertisement, and always
succeeded in stealing money from their
purses.

The Presa Club Ere Long to Take Corn
mod fous Kooms in a New
Edifice.
It has been decided by the Press Olub to
give its Christmas jinks on the evening of
December 21, or on the Saturday evening
before Christmas. On this occasion the
lady friends of members will attend, thus
making the entertainment a combination

ladies and gentlemen.
There will be a very interesting pro

asked to sire the jinks, and it is believed
that he will accept. Arrangements are

for it is on so firm a bssis from the in

low. Another charge is that the inspector
defrauded the Government by falsifying
his reports of expense? for traveling.
Special .Agent if. A. Moore detailed his
assistant, De Witt Jackson, to investigate
these charges. As a result of a careful in
quiry into Foley's methods a curious state
of uffairs was developed. H is charged
that he ana one Gus Devine had entered
into a conspiracy to blackmail Chinese;
that Devine hunted for illicit opium and
that Folev reported the cases to his su
perior. He was usually detailed to make
the seizures and arrest, but in but few in
stances, it is alleged, was thp drug turned
over to the Government. It was furtner
charged that he collected mouey on his
own account from the Chinese.
Special Agents Moore and Jackson de
clined to discuss the case, but those who
have seen the report of the investigating
inspector state that there is plenty of evi
dence not only to warrant Foley's dismis
sal but to cause him even more serious
trouble.
Collector Wise after suspending Foley
forwarded the report of the special agents
to the Secretary of the Treasury.

NO MORE THE
CHRISTMAS FLASK
Saloon - Keepers of the
Cocktail Route So
Determine.
A Fund in Its Stead Will Be
Made Up for the
Orphans.
Half of the Receipts Over the Bar
on Christmas Day Will Go Into
the Big Fund.
One of the most venerated laws of the
"cocktail route" is to be stricken from the
unwritten statute books this year.
A new law is to be added to tnis same
book which shall do much more credit to
the "cocktail route" itself and all who
stray thereon.
The little holiday flask prepared in times
past by the proprietors of the saloons for
their customers, the habitues of the toute,
is to be discontinued. Instead a fund of
one-half the receipts of Christmas day in
all these same saloons is to be made up
and donated to the orphan asylums of
this City in equal shares.
This very proper movement has been
decided upon apparently by concurrent
resolution of the proprietors of all lirst
class saloons in the Citj, together with
their customers.
Since the year 1, or thereabouts, holiday
times have seen all popular saloon ixen
struggling to get up a complete list of
their customers and to prepare some
specially bottled liquid joy to send to each
of them.
The movement started among a select
circie of the gilded bars along Kearny
street, spead to Montgomery street, thence
into Market, and this year it bids fair to
become the rule throughout the City. The
new movement began in the same place
and has taken tbe same course.
The custom of preparing ana presenting
the Christmas bottle, springing trom an
impulse on the part of the saloon-keepers
to do the generous and hospitable thiug,
was nevertheless fraught with no end oi
trouble to both donor and recipient. The
saloon man found it difficult to perfect
his list of customers; the extra nice bottle
was not easy to till in the required number
and the whole process was cosily in both
time and money.
Then a certain number of the best cus
tomers were certain to be overlooked. On
the other hand not all the customers who
were not overlooked were particularly
pleased at having souvenirs of this kind
coming to their homes from a number of

places where they were not supposed to be
upon such familiar ana friendly footing.
Much trouble aroee from this source. Be
sides, if there ever is a time of year vrhen
the follower of the "cocktail route" is sur
feited with eood things to drink, it is dur
ing the holiday season.
So the custom of Sfnding out the Christ
mas bottle feli, year by year, into disfavor
until it degenerated into a perfunctory
system of half-hearted advertising that no
one approves. This year it was finally de
termined to do away with it.
The objection was raised by some of the
saloon-keepers that they would be open to
the charge of selfishness or a desire to
economize at a time of the year when their
purse-strines were expected to be loosened.
This was met by the suggestion to form a
fund for the benefit of the orphans. This
was given immediate approval.
The sum raised will no doubt be a large
one, and will carry joy to those who have
little in their lives, instead of Roing to add
a fraction to the pleasures of those whose
holiday times are always merry.
No one approves of the movement so
heartily as the regular habitue of the
'â¢cocktai' route" himself, who will never

CHAMPION JACK
AND CLEVER JIM
The Famous Lightweights
Ready to Enter the
Ring.
St. George's Club Is Making
Great Preparations for the
Contest
Carroll Is in Grand Condition and
McAuliffe Is Sanguine of
Success.
Now that the much-talked-of battle be
tween Chovnski and Maher is a thing of
the past, the next great sporting event of
importance is the Carroll and McAuliffe
ten-round contest, which will be held on
Friday evening next at Woodward's Pa
vilion under the auspices of the St
George's Club.
There are many sporting men in this
City who witnessed the great battle which
took place in a clubroom on New Mont
gomery street between Jack and Jimmy
on the evening of March 21, IS9O, and
which was won by Jack in the forty
seventh round and at a time when it was
dollars to doughnuts that Carroll would
win.
Scientifically it was the greatest battle
Jack McAuliffe.
that was ever fought in this City, and Mc-
Auliffe, who was in poor condition when
he entered the ring, showed wonderful
generalship throughout the contest. Sev
eral times during the battle Carroll had
his opponent going, but something in
variably happened â frequently the timely
sound of the gong â that saved McAuliffe
from a knockout. Jack Dempsey was one
of McAuliffe's seconds, and to his admir
able coaching the lightweight champion
can attribute his success.
Carroll was in good condition and he
entered the ring confident of whipping
his clever opponent. Doubtless he would
have succeeded were it not for the
poor generalship he displayed in
the latter part of the fight. When he
found McAuliffe was fast going on his last
kicks.Jimmy rushed in to finish his game.
Jack met him with his elbow, the point of
which caueht Carroll in the eye. The
Jimmy CarrolL
blow dazeo Jimmy, and McAuliffe, seeing
that he had a chance of turning tbe tide
of battle, concentrated all his force into
one grand effort and as quick as a flash he
sent his powerful rinht across Carroll's
jaw and down went James on his back.
Amid the greatest excitement imagin
able Carroll was counted out, and every
one allowed that MeAuliffe was not only
a great leneral, but a really fortunate
fellow in having pulled victory out of the
fire.
Carroll has never recovered from that
one defeat, as he would have given a fin
ger of his good right hand to have whipped
McAuliffe. Ever since thattime he has
sought a return match with thÂ« champion,
but the opportunity did not offer untU the
St. George's Club was in the market as a
bidder for fistic talent.
After navine written several letters to
McAuliffe without receivin â¢ a reply, the
club corresponded with a prominent East
ern match-maker, who finally got McAu
liffe's consent to fight Carroll a ten-round
battle in this City. All patrons of the
ring are conversant with tbe details of the
match. A referee will be selected ou the
day of the fight, who mast give a decision
in accordance with the articles of agree
ment.
As the pugilists will enter the ring at
catch weights, it is not expected that they
have trained with a view of undergoing a
long strain. Carroll will certainly appear
in shape to fight for a man's life, and it
goes without saying that he will put up a
great battle.
McAuliffe, on the other hand, has not
trained so faithfully as his opponent, but
1; â¢â  is nevertheless in tine trim to go a hot
race of ten rounds' duration. He con
tends that for a ten-round contest a pugil
ist, instead of reducing fie^h until he has
the appearance of a racehorse, should cul
tivate strength and speed.
In conversation with some fnends these
are the words McAuliffe used last Sun
day:
"This training business is all right
enough wheu it is properly understood.
I train just for the kind of game I expect
to meet. I have trained now in expecta
tion of a hot argument of ten rounds or
less. My wind \p good and I feel strong
and able to go the distance. If Carroll
whips me I wiil have no excus* to offer.
lam here to win and I expect to carry a
bunch of the long green bacK to New York
with me with best wishes for Carroll and
his friends."
The Englishman "says nothing but
saws wood." Sufficient to say that he is
as confident of whipping McAuliffe on
this occasion as he is of entering the ring
Friday evening. There can be no such
thing as disputing the fact that the sport
ing fraternity will witness a grand exhibi
tion of science and generalship.
The preliminary bout between Hawkins
and Finnick, "the Arkansas X.id," will
also prove to be a very interesting affair.
The men are clever, and unless good
judges are greatly mistaken in their opin
ions the stranger Finnick will give Haw
kins a hard argument. The pugilists are
booked for ten rounds, but it ia doubtful if
the race will reach the limit.
Barney Farley received a telegram from
Arthur T. Lumley, manager of Jack Mad
den, the crack Eastern bantam, yesterday,
stating that little Jimmy Anthony's chal
lenge was accepted.
A deposit of ?250 was immediately
made, and the news telegraphed to Lum
ley. The latter also mentioned the fact
that Jack Downey would like a bout with
Dal Hawkins. Hawkins is willing to
gratify Downey's desire.
If everything be settled satisfactorily
the contest between Anthony and Hawkins
will take place in this City within a month.
Farley has been trying to match Anthony
lor some time, but from the way a con
test with him has been avoided was al
most as despairing as when his big pro
tege, the "Mission Giant," was deleated
by Choynski.
Billy Daley, who is doing business for
the Golden West Club, received a dispatch
from Colonel Hopkins of Chicago last
night to the effect that Jimmy Ryan had
just ielt there for San Francisco. He is to
battle with Tommy Tracey, and the con
test has now been definitely fixed for
Thanksgiving night at Union Hali, on
Howard street. Both men are repre
sented to be in fine condition.
Arrangements have been made for two
rattliug preliminaries. One will probably
be between King and Dixon, who put up
so fierce a contest a few weeks ago before
the San Francisco Club.
THE POOL GAMES.
They Will End Saturdnv if Hopeless
Losers Will Withdraw.
The Olympic Club ball pool tournament
will come to a close next Saturday night
if those players who have absolutely no
chance to make a showing wili drop out
and leave the others. The tournament
has been on now for three weeks and of
the twenty-eight entries, F. W. Graham,
who has been out of town, is the only one
who has not put in an appearance.
The sum total of games which snould be
played providing each man went a.'ainst
each of the others is 352 exclusive of the
tie games. So far, but 178 games have been
played, but four score uames more will
probably be all that will be played.
Hardee, Cunningham, Harrison, Thorn
ton, Brickell, Hodgkins, Slocnm, Moore,
Bachman and Fuller, who have each won
more games than they have lost will soon
come to the tie ames. This is the stace
of the tournament that will be watched
with the greatest interest.

A Lessee of tbe Schooner Moonlight
Ordered Under ArreÂ«t by Justice
of the Peace Cook.
Justice of the Peac^ Cook issued an
order of arrest yesterday for P. D. Saun
ders at the instance of D. Bunker & Co.,
the Custom-house brokers, who allege
that Saunders is about to leave the State

$150 per month for the use of the schooner
and bring her back tree of incumbrance.
Bunker & Co. state in the complaint
that the schooner was returned on Octo
ber 13 last, and that she was then incum
bere i to the extent of $324.
Suit was begun a.a:nst the three men
for that amount, and Saunders announced
that he would not only not pay the in
cumbrance, but was preparing to leave
tbe Slate. Saunders' bond was fixed at
$500. _

THE SAN FRANCISCO CAL!L, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 1896.
LEONORA JACKSON.
TRIUMPH OF A
CALIFORNIA GIRL
Miss Leonora Jackson Wins
the Mendelssohn Gold
Medal.
Contested Against the World in
the Berlin Conservatory
of Music.
Happy Over Hr Cfnqu r st She Wrote
â  I Have Held Up the Stars
and Stripes"
Once again the genius of a California
girl has surpassed the world.
Miss Leonora Jackson, daughter of
Charles P. Jackson, a pioneer banker end
merchant of the unostentatious little city
of Mud Springs, or El Dorado, as it is
sometimes known. El Dorado County, is
the modest possessor of this distiuction.
fehe has won the Mendelssohn gold medal
for her wonderful talent as a violinist in
the Berlin Conseivatory of Music, Berlin,
Germany, and those who contested with
her for the honor of the decoration marvel
at her ability.
Mr. Jackson, father of the young lady,
settled in Mud Springs in 1852. He was
accompanied by his wife, a musician of
rare talent, when he came to this coast.
He immediately established a proritabie
business and remained in California sev
eral years.
When his daughter was born he moved
to Chicago, and Mrs. Jackson soon estab
lished a reputation as an able musical in
structor. The daughter, Leonora, almost
Before she had outgrown that period of
life known as babyhood gave evidence
that she had inherited her mother's
talent. She was encouraged in her lore of
harmony, and her childish hands soon
learned to produce melodies on her violin
that gave evidence of unrivaled genius.
Four years a o her parents derided to
send her to tnÂ« Beriin Conservatory, and
tlieir expectations of fame for their daugh
ter hav<- been rewarded.
The little girl, then only 14 years of
age, soon became her instructor's favor
ite. Dr. Joachim, who is conceded to be
the most successful teacher of music now
before the public, took charee of the
young pupil and she made rapid progress.
She appeared frequently in concerts, but
not until she completed her course did she
make her formal debut.
That eventful occasion took place about
a month ago at the contest for the Men
delssohn medal. Musicians from the
farthest ends of the world, from the great
Enropean cities and from various portions
of America participated in the contest,
but at the end Leonora Jackson was pro
nounced the winner.
Her friends in Germany immediately
wrote to interested narties in this City
and stated that Dr. Joachim was so en
tranced at his pupil's success that he
rushed to the girl's side and with tears in
his eyes fondiy embraced her. The Berlin
newspapers pronounced her "the girl
wonder of Europe," and musicians
acquiesced. "I have held ud the stars
and stripes," wrot- "the girl wonder of
Europe" to her cousin, Mrs. Kate 8. Hart,
manager of the Ramona, "and I am satis
fied."
Mr?. Hart is extremely proud of her
cousin's accomplishments, and adds that
"she carried the flag to the top of the staff
and clinched it there."
INSPECT ORS UNDER FIRE

Davis and Uockery To-Day.
The Board of Health will hold a special
session this morning to investigate the
charges made by Zimmerman & Ruhland,
the dairymen, against Chief Food In
spector Dockery and Chief Market In
spector Ben Davis.
The milkmen declare positively that

TO TEST THAT
TRUST CLAUSE
Fair Will Lawyers to Turn
Their Attention in That
Direction.
A Judgment Must Be Secured
on It From the Supreme
Court.
Counsel for Charles Fair Reserves
tbe Right to Contest Within
a Year.
With the famous "pencil" document
out of the way the Fair will lawyers can
now devote themselves to the intricacies of
the "pen" or "trust" will, with the single
mindedness that that document demands.
To be entirely satisfactory to the heirs
and their lawyers that "trust clause"
which pervades it must be entirely elim
inated.
One great step toward that greatly
desired consummation hasÂ« been taken.
On March 15 Judge Slack decided that tbe
trust clausa, bo far as the real property
was concerned, is invalid.
No judgment on that decision was
given, however. That fact prevented an
appeal being taken to the Supreme Court.
So well satisfied were the heirs with this
decision, however, thai they immediately
forsook the pencil will which they had so
strongly espoused and fell into line favor
ing the pen will. Next Tuesday before
Judge Slack the argument will be made
upon the question of the validity of the
trust clause with regard to personal prop
erty.
It the court should decide the trust
clause invalid as to personal property,
and render judgment to that effect, any
one of the heirs may take an appeal. If
judgment is rendered the other way, then
the trustees may take an appeal. It is
necessary that the Supreme Court be
reached with this point and a decision
secured. ff Judge Slack renders judg
ment in the matter of the personal prop
erty as be has already done with regard
to the real property, and the Supreme
Court shall artirm his judgment, this will
leave tbe heirs nothing to desire. It will
only remain then for them to di7ide up
the immense property after tbe expiration
of the period of one year as provided by
law.
If the Supreme Court, however, should
decide against them â that is to say,
should decide that the trust clause is
I valid â tben the heir* would no doubt con
| test the will, and it is not impossible
that the pencil wiil might again find
favor in their eyes.
George Knight, as counsel for Charles
Fair, when the pen will went to probate
on Monday distinctly reserved his rights
to contest the will later if he saw fit. He
claims that right belongs to him for one
year, notwithstanding that the will of the
21st has been admitted to probate.
This opinion is, however, opposed by
many other lawyers, who claim that
i Knight ana the Fair children have had
their day in court; that their opportunity
to contest tbe will, they having had full
notice, is past.
The argument next Tuesday will be
made by Garret McEneruey for the trus
tees and by George Knight of Knight &
Heggerty for Charles Fair.
Next Friday morning Mr. Delnias will
make an argument upon the demurrer to
Charles Fair's cross-complaint in the suit
in ejectment for the Mission and Pine
street property brought by Mrs. Craven.
QUICKSILVER OR FRUIT.
Hearing of the Guadalupe Land Cat*
Before the Registrar and Re
ceiver yesterday.
The hearing of tbe Gnadalupe land case
was resumed yesterday before the Regis
trar and Receiver of the United States
Land Office. The principals in the con
tention are the farmers residing on a 900
--acre tract about four miles from Los
Gatos, and the Guadalupe Quicksilver
Mining Company, which claims the tract
as mineral lands. The property has been
in dispute for several years, the settlers
going ahead toward the completion of
their filings and the mining people pro
testing against the issuance of the deeds
by the land office under the homestead
act.
The agricultural claimants have been
permitted by the Government to improve
their holdings, planting orchards and
vineyards, until it is alleged the so-called
quicksilver lands blossom as the rose.
Last month they appeared before the
Registrar to finish proving up their en
tries, an '. were met by the mining com
pany with a protest. Testimony was
heard on bath sides for several days and
the case went over till November 17.
Yesteruav tbe former claimants, con
sisting of V. A. Schelier, Matt and Paul
America, J. D. McKenzie, Charles B.
Cole, O. Dunker, C. P. Owen, John Doyle
and Captain Callundan, the last of this
City, were in attendance with their attor
neys, William Stuart and V. A. Scheller.
The Guadalupe Mining Company was rep
resented by H. B. Thayer and Attorneys
M. D. Hyde and W. P. Veuve.
The agriculturists yesterday put on a
number of witnesses to prove that the soil
was fertile farm and fruit land and not
rocky ground capable of growing nothing
except flasks of quicksilver, as the mine
claimants hold.
H. A. Brainard, editor of the Trpe and
Vine, a horticultural journal published at
Los Gatos, testified that he owned prop
erty adjoining the tract in dispute and it
was the best soil for fruit in the world.
"What will grow best on your place?"
was a<Ked the witness.
"You might better ask what will not
grow there," he answered. "I have lemon
trees that grow four inches a week and my
two-year-old fruit trees are bearing big
crops."
In the former hearing D. B. Hicks, a
farmer of the tract, swore that he failed
to raise anything there and that the land
was worthless for grain or fruit. Editor
Brainard gave a? expert testimony yester
day that the trouble lay in Farmer Hicks
and not in the soil, and more industry on
his part would have made him a more
accurate agricultural experl for his friends,
the mining people.
The case goes on this morning at 9:30
and wili probably consume the rest of the
week, as many witnesses are to be heard
on both sides.

Ilario Flores Stopped by
Two Footpads and

They Cut His Hat to Pieces and
Battered Him Into Sub
mission.
The Victim Fought His Assailants
Until His Strength Gave Out,
Then He Quit.
Ilario Flores, a young man employed in
Philip Simon's barber-shop, 3 Stockton
street, had an experience with footpads
early Sunday morning that is likely to be
retained in his memory for years to come.
The young man was on hia way to the
shop about 5:30 o'clock in the morning
and when on Geary, near Stockton, two
men held him up. After battering him up,
cutting his hat in several places in a des
perate attempt to stab him, the thieves
relieved him of some small change and
made their escape.
"I was walking ulowly along the street, '
said Flores, "when I was stopped by two
men, who asked me for some money. I
had none to spare, and was about to con
tinue on my way when they jumped on
me and attempted to take the money from
my pocket. I did not want to lose my
money, so I fought back, but it did me no
good. The men struck me in the face and
on the head and finally one of them drew
a knife. He slashed at me and I dodged,
the knife cutting away part of my hat
brim. The man who wielded the knife
cut my hat in several places, but I miracu
loubly escaped serious injury. At last
they lorced me to the wall and took my
money and ran down the street.
"I had a good look at the men, and in
case I should ever meet them on the street
I will follow I hem and inform an officer as
to their identity and mode of operation."

A Conductor Collapses With
More Than Usual
Grace.
HE HAS RESUMED WORK.
I Stood Up to His Duty, but It
â¢ Proved Too Much â Early
Folly Again.
The life of a conductor on a streetcar
may be a "picnic," as His "Weary-ship
terms it, bat the work is more exacting
than most people have any notion of.
The strain has sent more than one man to
folly. It will send others.
This anecdote, in illustration will suit.
It is related . by - a lady of unquestioned in-
tegrity and is doubtless true, even in the
minutest detail. She boarded a down-
town car at about 9:30 early in September
and noticed that the conductor was very
nervous. When he took her fare be could
scarcely hold the change in his hand, and
eventually she became sure that the man
had "been on a drunk." It was a cruel
misapprehension, but only natural. .
The poor fellow was evidently suffering
acute pain in his back, loins and kidneys,
for he continually rubbed these tiarts him-:
self, and he was bathed in a cold perspira-
tion. , â¢
The business of collecting fares had to
be cone on with, nevertheless, but by the
time the ferries were nearly reached ; the
vitality had almost left the frame.
"He is a sick man," murmured a fat
woman in a brown dress and a preen hat ;
but as that green hat was not on straight
(or at least she thought it wasn't), the
knight of the nickel punch received no
more thought from her.
The car stopped ; the conductor flopped
into a corner of the car, and all but the
lady who knows the "true inwardness" of
the tale left for the various boats. She
went to him and offered him a siD of
brandyâ actually brandy. "/.She was in-
terested in medicine and knew his straits.
She suggested his being relieved by an-
other conductor. That was * done, but
when he came to â¢ take off â  hi-> bell-punch
the poor fellow, dropped it, so weak and
nervous was he.. .
They â '. took him up to the Hudson Med-
ical Institute, and when he was carried up
the stairs of the groat white building at
the ! junction of - Stockton, /Market -'and
Ellis streets his "conducting" seemed to
be. about over. ' j , '
A chat of â¢: five minutes with one of the
senior physicians and a sniff of ammonia
revived him sufficiently to enable him to
explain that for many - weeks he had suf-
fered ~ from insomnia; he j- had horrible
dreams; his breath 1 was surely - offensive
(that needed no explanation), r- and he
could scarcely see.
â¢â¢Well, 1 said the physician in charge
"we will take care of you." And then he
made an exhaustive examination. Even
professional : inquirers were ' barred - from
this, ; but when .; it ' was over he said :*
" 'Hadyan' is what he wants principally.
He's run down; : weak; lacks vital force."
And then ;he - added, "Get â  well Of
course he will. His system is deranged
not Toyed." Â, , Â7/. Â . â /. j :i . ;,â¢ â :
I saw that self-same conductor with the
bloom of health on his countenance yes-
terday ' and l I saw the f bell-punch ; in a
steady, firm, hand, and he ; took my fare. 1
He looks splendidly, and he said he felt so.
: What's â  his name or number? /I know,
but the world must not, because the cause
of all the trouble was early folly neglected.
Ii "Hudyan" can make such cures as
this, what can't it do? That's what I
would like to ask! ;. How do ;i; know ; this
story is true? My own wife gave th man
the brandy ! re?' ' J ' " A. H. Ping

BOOM WHEAT
Drought and Locusts Cut
. .' Short Argentine and
Indian Crops.
In Spite of Zigzag Movements
the General Tendency Is
Advanced Prices.
. The Net Loss for the Two Great
Countries Is About Forty Per
Cent of the Entire Crop.
: There has been considerable discussion
â¢ < in financial circles during the past week
â¢"over the erratic fluctuations in the price
â¢ of "bread stuffs. In spite of the zigzag
movement, however, there has been a
general rise in prices, and the prospect is
that they will go higher still.
The market was a little "off" yesterday,
measured by a fall of about 3 cents In
wheat, but in five days past there was an
â¢advance of 25 cents a barrel in flour.'
R Speaking of the matter yesterday James
,o'Leary, editor of ; the Journal of Com
merce, said: "The general understanding
among those who know the subject well
seems to ' be that the rise in prices has
been due to the failure of crops in - India
â¢ and to short crops in the Argentine wheat
fields. In India the shortage is due to
drought, while in the Argentine Republic
â¢ drought and locusts have combined to cut
the crors short." -
'.'â¢ The reason of the recent slight fall in
price is attributed to a reaction from over
"speculation, which made the price run too
â¢ high. While prices rise and fall, the gen
<â  eral tendency shows a rise. The condi
tion of the market becomes 'more and
"more favorable to the holders of wheat each
day. Occasionally there is a weakening,
' but not often, and as a rule the market
'i denotes an advance. The best estimate?
show that the Argentine and Indian crops
are at least 40 per cent short. â  The ad
vance of wheat, strangely, has been
accompanied by a decline of freights, and
'this makes the general prospects to hold
ers to wheat more encouraging.:

NANCY'S WIFEHOOD.
Quackenbush Denies It, and Transfers
All His Property.
Thomas Quackenbush is trying to defeat
the claim of Mrs. Nancy Abbott Quacken
bush to a part of his property. She says
bhe. was married to Quackenbusb by con
. tract several years ago, and demands $500
"a month alimony from the property, which
.Is worth $1,000,000, and yields an income
of $2000 a month.
Quackenbush swears that he never
married the lady, whom he persists in
calling Nancy Abbott, and avers that if
his name appears on any Â«uch contract, it
is a forgery.
Recently suit was began by Qaackenbush
10 have the document, whatever it may be,
adjudged fraudulent and a forgery, and
the case is now pending.
In order to further combat the claim
of the lady who says she is bis wife,
(Quackenbush has deeded all his real
estate to Lis daughter, Mrs. Esther jÂ£.
. Swartfiguer.
The legal complications that have come
on Quackenbush have disconcerted him so
much that his health has been affected,
and he is lying ill at bis residence, 911
Webster street, in this City. He expressed
' a determination to tight the case as long
as he lives.

DURRANT MAY
YET RE HEARD
His Lawyers Have Com
pleted Their Delayed
Brief.
It Is Expected That the Supreme
Court Will Reverse Its
Order.
This Will Give Durrant an Opportu
nity to Have Many Points of
Law Considered.
The Durrant case took another step
forward yesterday, but this does not
necessarily imply that the final disposi
tion of the matter bas been materially
hastened. Tbe attorneys for Durrant,
Messrs. Dickinson and Deuprey. have been
laboring steadily to perfect their brief on
appeal ever since the Supreme Court at
Los Angeles, on motion of the Assistant
Attorney-General, made an order to con
sider the appeal without further delay.
They have finally completed their brief,
and a copy of this was handed yesterday
to the clerk of the Supreme Court. It has
not been tiled, nor can it until the order
of tbe court shall have been rescinded.
As the matter now stands, Durrant has
not baa any argument submitted in his
behalf since the transcript on appeal was
filed some months a?o. Neither General
Dickinson nor Mr. Dsuprey was at Loe
Angeles to make an oral argument or to
oppose tbe motion of tbe Assistant At
torney-General. They supposed that it
bad been agreed by the Attorney-General
that they should have time to complete
their brief, and so did not consider it nec
essary to go to Los Angeles. The unfor
tunate position in which Durrant was
placed caused his attorneys to urge upon
â¦he Attorney-General that they should
be given a chance to get in their brief,
pleading misunderstanding as a reason.
While no positive announcement has
been made by Attorney-.General Fitz
gerald, it is generally understood that he
will not now oppose the filing of the brief,
considering that a life is at stake. The
filing wili be made just as soon aa tbeeon
sent of the Supreme Court can be ob
tained. The Justices will be in tbe City
to-day, and action will probably be taken
very soon.
The brief which has been prepared is
long and embraces a very large number of
law points, exceptions to the proceedings
before tbe trial Judge and jury, tbe nature
of all of which has been previously indi
cated. Altogether there are 280 pages of
closely printed matter submitted' for the
consideration of the Justices, which, in
addition to oral argumen ts of more or less
length, will help to swell the already phe
nomenal bulk of the literature of tbe cast*
to almost unheard-oi pioportions. This does
not complete tbe array, however, for now
tbe Attorney-General wil make his an
swer to tbe brief, if it shall be admitted to
filing, and then, later, the appellant will
file another brief, and so the record will
grow longer and iongpr.

CHRISTIAN ENDEAVORERS.
Meeting of Ministers to DUcnss the
Convention to Be Held Here

Yesterday afternoon about thirty
ministers representing the denominations

and the big convention of next July met
informally in the Young Men's Christian
Association building to suggest what
ought to be done preparatory to the com
ing of the Endeavorers.
The meeting was called to order by J.
8. Wabster, who announced that every
thing was progressing favorably and that
all the money needed is in sight.
The Rev. Dr. Mackenzie, who presided,
stated that enthusiasm in a spiritual sense
is needed to welcome the Endeavorers.
He expressed the hope that something
would be done to arouse the people,
adults and young, as to the grand work
the society is doing. He also spoke of the
spiritnal impression that the great
gathering will leave on the young people.
The Rev. Dr. Dille favored the inaugura
tion of prayer meetings from now until
next July, so as to be prepared to receive
the people who are coming here for the
spiritual good of the City and its inhabi
tants.
Tne Rev. Dr. Rader expressed sorrow
that such ignorance exists in regard to the
purpose of the Endeavorers, and thought
that every pastor ought to kindle a fire of
enlightenment to dispel thia ignorance.
Mr. Webster said that there ought to be
unity of action in regard to the En
deavorers.
The Rev. Dr. Bushnell expressed him-
Belf in iavor of interdenominational ac
tion.
John W. Baer. National secretary of the
United Society of Christian Endeavorers,
who recently arr.veo from Boston to as
certain what has been and is being done,
delivered a short address and dwelt upon
the great results that have followed these
Endeavorer meetings, and expressed him
self as exceedingly well pleased with what
ha had seen and heard about the work
already done in this City and State, and

are wonderinsr whose head will drop next.
Mr. As worth, having failed to get a
renomination for the office he now holds,
and intends to bold if he can get tbe
courts to sustain his contention that he is
a "hold over," some of his men went into
the political fray and worked hard to elect
Superintendent-elect Ambrose. Mr. Ash
worth said nothing at the time, but he
thought a heap, and now as a result of
their partisanship some of them are out.
A few minor changes were made im
mediately after election, but these were
put on economy's Bcore, and the first re
moval for purely political reasons came
yesterday.
John Tapptan, a deputy, was particu
larly aggressive in his advocacy of Mr.
Ambrose, and he was quietly notified that
his services would no longer be required.
Fred Raabe, who has beetfcin the Street
Department in a minor position for some
time, was immediately appointed to the
vacant deputyship.
Other changes are expected during the
next few days.
Another reason why Superintendent
Ashworth is not very friendly with some
of bis men is because they do not agree
with him that he is entitled to keep his
position until the next municipal election.
Some who nave baen spoken to about
the matter have declared openly that
they do not believe he is entitied to hold,
and have even had the temerity to tell
the Superintendent so. Some of these
would not be surprised ir they were re
moved before the first of the year.

HUNTERS WHO HAD A MUD BATH
While Sculling In the >'ovato Slough
Their Boat Sank.
Two young men named Thompson and
Murphy who were i unting on Sunday on
the Sonoma marshes near Black Point
had a narrow escape from drowning.
While sculling down the Novato Slough
in the early morning the boat in which
they were seated sprang a leak and sank
just as the hunters ran its prow into the
mud within a few feet of the bans.
In their haste to reach terra iirma one
of tne hunters fell over the prow of the
craft, with the result that his gun was dis
charged and the contents tore a hole in
the mud immediately in front of his face.
They escaped, however, after receiving a
first-class mud bath and an experience
which will teach them in future to bÂ« care
ful about entering ducking boats that are
not periectly sound in construction.
A constable at Novato who was em
ployed to keep hunters off the Pacheco
and Da Loner estates arrested two men on
Sunday afternoon at Ignacio, because they
yflf Murphy Building, t J
Martet anfl. Jones Strand
refused to leave the hunting-grounds when
ordered by the officer to vacate. They were
escorted to San Rafael, where they gave
bail for their appearance in court yester
day.
Mr. Pacheco stated that he had been an
noyed so lon a; by hunters from San Fran
cisco and San Rafael who persisted in
shooting among his cattle that he had to
employ some salutary means of keeping
trespassers off his land.
TVhe moonlight shooting on last Satur
day night near Burdells was the means of
driving the wild game to the bay, where
they remained all day Sunday. With the
exception of a few hunters who bagged
considerable birds by the light of the
moon, the sportsmen who returned from
the Sonoma marshes on Sunday evening
had very little game. Ed Ladd and a
friend had an excellent duck shoot in the
Suisun marshes on Sunday. Their bag
amounted to forty-nine birds, among
which were mallard, canvasback, sprig
and teal.
Emma aud Louise Sold.
The schooner Emma and Louise was sold by
United States Marshal Baldwin under a decree
by default of the United States District Court.
The sale was to satisfy a claim amounting to
$1650 by Coghill and Kohn for groceries and
ship supplies furnished. The schooner was
knocked down to J. Jensen for $1950, which
is regarded as a very low prlcft, the vessel
being a stanch and seaworthy craft.

CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 17.â The wheat market
lacked strength and vigor this morning and prices
were . lower. The undertone was not so â  weak,
however, as the surface appearances of the mar
ket indicated. Every eighth loss in price was
stubbornly contested, and when selling pressure
was in the least moderated a rally . took pluce.
Liverpool opening cables were V a d lower for spot
wheat an 1 unchanged but weak for futures. That
information was mainly responsible for the open

IS HEARD FROM
Ran Out of Judge Gibson's
Courtroom Ten Years
Ago.
The Sympathetic Jurist Made an
Order Depriving Her of
Her Children.
Sha Is Now Selling a Book in Montana
of Which Sh? Was the
Author.
Oakland Officb San Fbancisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Nov. 18. J
For the first time since "Calamity Jane"
ran out of Judge Gibson's courtroom
about ten years ago and disappeared she
has been heard from. At the present time
she is traveling the Western States selling
a book which relates her many daring ex
periences.
When Judge Gibson was on the bench
Calamity Jane, her children and their
father were before him, and figured in one
of the most striking cases ever tried in the
Alameda County courts. The father
wanted possession of the children and al
leged that Jane was a dissipated character
who was unfit to have their care or cus
tody.
When the evidence of the father was all
in Calamity Jane arose and pleaded her
own case. Her costume and demeanor,
both that of a typical border woman of a
generation ago, attracted the profoundest
attention, and while she spoke and sobbed
no other sound could be heard.
â¢"Judge," saiii Calamity Jane, "these
children are mine, and I am able to work
for them. I know I'm not a church-going
woman, but l"m honest. 1 drink some
times, but I was never bo diunk that I
could not protect my children, nor did
ajiy one of them ever want for anything.
Now, look at this man who wants to take
'em from me. Take a j;ood look at him,
Judge, and see if you think he is any more
fit than me to take care of 'em. Judce.
ten years aeo I saved that man's life. He
get into a shootin,' scrjipe Â«nd was shot
full of holes. If I hadn't cared for him he
would be dead lone ago. I nursed him
and cared for him like a sister, and he's
the lather of these children that he would
take from me now."
Judge Gibson was impressed witn the
woman's story, and said that his inclina
tion was to award the children to their
mother, "But the law is very clear on
this point." he said, "and I cannot do
otherwise than give the children to their
Â« father."
"Take 'em from me, Judge, and give
'em to him?" cried Calamity Jane. As
soon as the little ones were approached by
their lather they ran to their mother and
she grasped them with an iron grip. , The
services of two or three deputies were
necessary to take them from her.
. Judge Gibson admired the woman's
bluniuess and evident courage and said
he would see that she was provided for.
Calamity Jane listened to the kind words
from the bench and sbrieked as soon as
the Judge finished. She heard her chil
dren crying as they were led off by their
father and the officers and controlled her
â scit enough to say-r*"Judjre,"tliey don't, do
things in this way in Arizona. There they
â would have given my children to me and
.not to tnat useless character."
"Madam," said Judge Gibson with a
moist eye, "I'm sorry I'm not in Arizona
because I believe vou could be made good;
I have no such opinion of that man. But
Jaw is law." .
"While the Judge was writing to a chari
table lady to attend to the broken-hearted
mother Calamity Jane rushed out of the
courtroom, headed for the creek ferry
route and disappeared. For a long time
it was thought the unhappy woman bad
ended her life, but, instead, she disap
peared from Western life for some years,
and has reappeared as an author.
, A newspaper writer, who saw her in
Montana a few days ago, thus describes
her:
, She is a masculine-looking woman, wearing
a blacif sombrero and a dress 01 dark, rough
material. She is lone-boned and brown and
old, yet active. For years alter 1885 she dis
appeared from Western view, having married
Clinton Burke at El PaÂ«so, but last January she
reappeared at Deadwood, where a great part
of her Career had been passed, and re-entered
public life by becoming a dancer on a variety
stage. This was not to her liking. The life of
the boards proved too exacting and hard for
her in her advanced years, and she took the
bint oi a friend and became an author. â¢ â¢
â¢ Calamity Jame belongs to a type once com
mon enough a.: over the Wesr. from Dakota to
the western line of Montana, but now extinct.
- For a few years she was a Government scout,
and she participated in several Indian cam
paigns, nntabiy Ouster's Neat Perce campaign
in 1872-73, whea she received the name by
which sue is now known.
â  She was a crack rifle and revolver shot and
drifted between the mining camps and stage
posts of South Dakota, Utah, Montana and
Wyoming for years. For years before her de
parture for the South she was a pony express
rider, thus having an occupation sufficiently
exciting in those days, when Sioux were hos
tile, and covered every trail. Her route was in
the Black Hills, between Deadwood and Cus
ter, and she covered it without fear. In 1882
She took up a ranch near Miles City, Mont.,
and began cattle raising. She also had an inn
where' the traveler might get food, drink or
trouble, as seemed to him best.
BERKELEY'S NEW SCHOOL.
A Fine Eight-Room Building to Be
Erected on I>wight Way.
BERKELEY, Cal., Nov. 17.â The Board
of Education decided last night to erect a
new eight-room public school building on
the recently purchased Dwight-way lot,
the previous action with relation to the
construction of a building on the same lot
having been rescinded because of its il
legality.
The drawings of Cunningham Brothers
of Oakland were accepted for a second
Berkeley's New Eight-Room ScWhctise Which Will Be Erected on Dwight WayÂ»
time. The architects were ordered by a
resolution of the board to prepare such
specifications as are necessary to secure
bids for the construction of the building
complete. The new structure is to cost
about $15,000, and the plans contemplate
a two-story frame structure of Italian
renaissance design.
The buildinc will have a frontage of 126
feet on Dwight way, with a maximum
depth of 74 leet. The main entrance in
the center of the main front will be
formed by a circular-colun:ned portico.
The main corridor will be ten feet in
tl>c clear with four classrooms opening
up from it on each floor. Off the ves
tibule on the niain floor below will be the
principal's ottice. on the opposite side
the library. Provision is also made on
the first floor for teachers' lunchroom,
dressing-room and laboratory. On the
second floor will be four classrooms, an
assembly-hall capable of seating 250
persons, a janitor's room and study-hall.
The unilateral system of lighting will be
used in all the classrooms, the light in
every case coming from the left of the
pupils as they are seated at their d-sks.
Five exits to tire building are provided, to
be used in case of fire. California yellow
pine will be used throughout for the in
terior finish.
For Reslatant Vines.
BERKELEY, Cal., Nov. 17.â The agri
cultural experiment station at the State
University has sent to France for 11.000
cuttings of resistant vines. There are
about 10,000 such cuttings already rooted
in the experimental gardens. Next spring
the entire 21,000 will be distributed among
the vineyardiats of the State for use in
their tight against the phylloxera pest.

Antonio Devencenzi on Trial for a
Hill Tragedy of Last
Winter.
Oakland Office. San Frakcisco CaalJ
908 Broadway, Nov. 17. j
Nearly a year ago the body of Felice
Varni was found a short distance off the
county road, near Elmhurst. The large
number of shots found in the body showed
that the man bad been murdered. On the
day preceding the murder Varni and a
party of friends went out hunting. They
returned at different times, and when the
District Attorney and Sheriff had made
their investigation they charged three
men, Antonio Devencenzi, M. Ghirardelli
and G. Lnzzaretti, with the murder. The
i wo latter have been set free, as the evi
dence was not sufficient to convict, and
the trial of Devencenzi opened this morn
ing.
The tragedy stirred up considerable
feeling in the Italian quarter, and bad the
authorities had to deal with people who
could talk the English language and who
were not easily influenced by threats their
duties would have been much easier and
the results mignt have been different.
There is one pathetic feature to the case.
At the trials of the men now free there
was always present one attractive little
woman in black. t?he was i very atten
tive listener and never missed a session
ither at the preliminary examination or
at the trial. She was present this morn
njr and is as interested as formerly. This
; ittie woman is really an unmarried widow. \
Ling before this she would have been Mr?,
Varni had not that cruel 3hooting to deatu j
i the hills lai-t winter robbed her of her i
ver. She may be called upon to testify, I
and if she is her story will be interesting.
The jury was obtained last week, and
this morning County Surveyor Nusuaumer
explained to ihe jurors the details of a
mup of the scene where Varni was round,
and of the alleged wanderings of the man
who is charged with murdering him.
Judge Greene took a seat with the jury,
and as Denmy District Attorney Church
examined Mr. Nusbaumer regarding the
maps the courtroom was paintully quiet.
Colonel Tom Garrity is defending the
prisoner, and he had a busy day trying to
prevent Detective Herbert from telling
too much of what he found as the result
of his investigations.
The case against Devencenzi is stronger
than that against the others. The District
Attorney stated that just prior to the
hunting trip the prisoner and Varni, who
had been partners, had quarreled and had
separated. Sheila had been found wrapped
in a bloody handkerchief under Deven
cenzi's bed, and these|shells corresponded
in size nnd color with those found near
Varni's body.
The trial will be continued to-morrow.
EVENLY MATCHED.
Athletic Contests Before the Keliance
Club Which Evoked Much
i nt huslagin.
OAKLAND, Cal.. Nov. 17.â The Reli
ance Atbletic Club gave the first o! their
winter series of gentlemen's nights at
their clubrooms on San Pablo avenue. A
larce enthusiastic ana appreciative
audience was present.
The principal events of the evening were
a wrestling match between Harry Gelder
of the Oakland Athletic Club and Harry
Carroll of the Reliance; and a six-round
boxing bout Detween Jim Brown, Â£ negro
of San Francisco, and Ed O'Mailey of
Oakland.
Five of the six rounds fought by Brown
and O'Mailey were hard and fast, O'Mai
ley having sliu'htly the advantage at the
close. No decision was r ndered.
In the wrestling match Golder and Car
roll worked for an hour without a fall, and
after the close of the last boxing bout,
which was between John. Scott and
Charles Slambers, tney went at it again
for another half hour.
The first preliminary bont of three
rounds was between Charles Catbcart of
the Olympic Cluu and Jimmi? Fox of the
Acme. Tin next, of _ three rounds also,
was between Danny Needham of Oakland
and Harry Howard of Portland. The
tiiiri bout took place between Tom
Tracy, champion welter-weight of Aus
tralia, and Bert Brown of the Acme
Club. In this set-to some very clever
sparring was done on both sides, and
much applause was elicited from the
audience.
CHIEF FAIR UNFAIR.
Exceeded His Duty When Hustling
Citizens at the Theater.
OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 17.â The trouble
between Fire Cbiel Fair and the Macdon
j ougn Theater management is settled, and
Chief Fair has acknowledged that he ex
ceeded the provi^ons of the ordinance
governing such matters.
George E. de Golia, attorney ipr the
Macdonough interests, rendered Manager
Hall a long opinion to-day. The most
salient points are:
It cannot be sail that the Chief of the tfire
Department or (he Hre Warden are visiting
your theaier In an official capacity when they
come In aud take seals in the auditorium or
go back on the stags during a performance
! and hang around me wings because pretty
women are p'-forming a part.
I have carefully examined the ordinances of
the city of Oakland and can find no authority
for tiie entrance of the Cuief of the Fire De
partment or Fire Warden into your theater
I while a performance is in progress except un
. der ordinance 876. which applies only in case
! oi fire. I find nothing in ordinance 1035, pre
i scribing the duties of the Fire Warden, which
1 authorizes him to insist upon entrance into
t your theater except for specified purposes
I therein set forth, none of which give him the
1 right to enter your theater upon ordinary oc
j casionsor during still less does
1 it authorize him to take other people with
him to tee the performance without paying
the admission fee.
1 do not think any reasonable man would
say that because a numberof reputable gentle
men were standing in tne side aisles of your
auditorium leaning up against the wall, such
gentlemen would come under the head of
j "other obstructions'' set forth in the ordinance
quoted. It seems tonnr mind absurd to class
I a gentleman capable of movii.e himself as an
' "obstruction" in the same class with sofas,
j chairs and campstools. If a gentleman bean
I obstruction standing in the aisle-way of a
theater temporarily, "the same gentleman
would be equally an obstruction standing on
the floor of a ballroom, equally covered by
this section.
Again, if ordinance 1537 bad been violated
and was being violated the lessee is made by
tbe ordinance liable for the violation thereof,
and If you violated the ordinance or permitted
its violation in your building you should have
been by the proper officials arrested and pun
ished therefor in Hit? manner provided bylaw.
I know of no right or authority vested in Mr.
Fair or Mr. Murdock, either as members of the
Fire Department or otherwise, to enforce any
provisions of this ordinance themselves, inde
pendent of any court or the proper mode of
procedure laid down by law. Still less can I
find any justification for insulting reputable

Mayor Davie introduced a resolution to
nistht at the meeting of the Police and
Fire Commissioners, prohibiting city
employes from accepting any pass from
places of public amusement. The Mayor
and Chief Fair had an exciting conversa
tion, but it is very probable that the
measure will pass at the next meeting.
MUNICIPAL OWNERSHIP.
i:. J. ' Smith Says Manager ' I!ritton*s
Letter on â  the , Subject i Was
Full of Mistakes.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Nov. 17.â The com
munication of John A. Britton, manager
of the Oakland Gas, Light and Heat Com
pany, referred to in this morning's Call,
has bronght forth an answer from Ben
jamin J. Smith. This gentleman takes
exception to M r . Britton's statement,
which nays:
. The management of the city of Philadelphia
works has been notoriously corrupt and offers
h\ve been made to furnish gas to the city at a
mnch less price than that at which the city is
serving itself, and yet with coal and oil at its
doors, with labor 50 per cent cheaper than in
California, with a send out more than 1000
times greater than that of the city of Alameda
per diem, they are unable to celt it at less
than $1 p-.-r thousand.
In answer Mr. Smith says:
The Philadelphia Gas Company is worked on
eight-hour shins and is 50 per cent higher in
wages than Is pnid in Oakland or San Fran
cisco. The Philadelphia Gas Company in five
years has put into the city's treasury $5,403,
--908 ove<" and above expenses ann sells the gas
forsl. The companies in New York, Chicago.
San Francisco, Brooklyn and all big
cities 5.3.1 their project for more than
a dollar and were never known to give ud a
cent except in taxes, and in that they are
notoriously deceitful. Philadelphia buys
water gas from a private company and pays 35
cents per 1000 feet for what ought to cost
only 20 cents. They use it for mixing. This
is corruption, aud it is a notorious fact that
wherever a public utility is furnished by a
private company corruption rules.
Mr. Britton's assertion â that his com
pany sell their production cheaper than
anywhero in the United States â is an
swered in the following language:
The amount of oil and coal received by the
Oakland Gaa Company is we'l known. Very
little coal is used. Nearly all oil gas is deliv
ered in the holder, which does not cost over
25 cenu per 1000 cubic feet. Experts say it
should be delivered for 50 cents per 1000 cubic
feet, and that price would cover leakage, dis
tribution, taxes and t>olttical expenses. Ala
meda now gives the Oakland (ins Company
some $65,000 a year, at least $40,000 too
much. If Aiameda owned her own gas plant
and sold gas for $1 per 1000 feet, luel. light
and neat would be half as cheap as it is now,
there would be ten times more gas used, and
so much money would flow into the city treas
ury that taxes would ahnost be unknown, and,
best of ail, there would be one less corruption
fund.
Refused to Accept It.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Nov. 17.â The joint
committee of the city of Alameda and the
Oakland Board of Trade on the harbor
question met last evening in the City
Hail, but the amended report made by
the mass*meetinr a week ago was not in
dorsed. Dr. McL-an again brought np
some points that had been rejected at
each meeting and insisted upon their
adoption. They were again rejected, and
other questions which could not be satis
factorily settled at that time were laid
over, to be taken up at a meeting to be
held later in the week.

CURIOUS STORIES OF WHIST.
A. Favorite Game of Celebritiesâ A Game
That Caused Great Sorrow.
Lord Bligo was at a cardtable when the
news was brought to him that his mag
nificent residence was on nre. He stopped
only a moment to ascertain whether or
not hi 9 presence would be of material ser
vice on the scene of the conflagration.
Finding that it would not be calmly took
up the hand which had been dealt him
while he was talkine wiih the messenger
and resumed -play.
A case where a simple game of whist
was responsible for a good deal was that
in which G. 11. Drummond of the famous
Charing Cross banking-house of London
lost Â£25,000 at a single sit ing to Beau
Brummel. When his losses became known
to Drummond's partners they decided
that a gambler was an undesirable as
sociate in a business requiring for pros
perity the confidence of the public in its
managers. They therelore forced him to
retire.
What is known as a Yarborough hand
in whist is one in which there is no card
above a nine spot. The name given to
this hand is derived from a certain Lord
Yarborough, who used to offer the attrac
tive but very safe wager of Â£1000 to Â£1
that a hand of this sort would not be
dealt. He may have worked out the
chances or he may not, but the fact is
such a hand occurs only once in 1827
rounds. It is said that Yarborough won
his wager many thousand times.
At the Union Ciub of Boulogne some
years ago the dealer dealt the twenty-six
red cards to himself and partner and all
the black cards to their opponents. When
we come to realize that the odds against
such a round of hands are eight billion to
one, we must admit this was a very re
markaole deal.
Metternich, the great Austrian states
man, owed to a single game of whist the
greatest sorrow of his life. One evening,
while he was engaged in is favorite
game, an express arrived with dispatches
from Galicia. He placed the papers on
the mantelpiece, and went on playing all
that night and far into the morniner.
When the party broke up he was horrified
to learn that upon bis immediate reply to
the dispatches depended the fate of 2000
innocent persons. Had Metternich loved
whist less passionately history had never
recorded the infamous" Galician massacre.

AS ARISTOCRATIC DWARF.
Ho Was of High Birth and Breeding
and Wat Favored by Royalty.
On September 5, 1837, at his cottage
near Durham, where he had lived in re
tirement for many years, died Bomlwaskl,
a Polish count, bat who had made this
country the home of his latter days.
Though low of stature he was of high
birth and breeding, which no donbt has
caused his case to be frequently men'
tioned.
He was born in November, 1729, in the
reign of George 11, am as he did not die
till the first year of that of Queen Vic
toria, at ihe age of 98 years, ne lived dur
ing those of five British sovereigns. At
one year of age he had attained to only
14 inches in stature; at 6, to 17 inches; at
20, to 33 inches, and at 30, to 39 inches.
And he had a sister, named Anastasia,
seven years younger, who, when full
grown, was shorter than himself by a
bead and shoulders, so that she could
stand under his arm. But, though so
small in stature, he was a handsome man,
his body being of the must perfect sym
metry ; and he was, moreover, not only a
wit, but something of a scholar and an ac
compliaiied gentleman, his mind being
cultivated to an extraordinary degree by
travel and study, for he had visited vari
ous lands and many ot the royal courts of
Europe. In earlier life he had been exhib
ited and had appeared as an actor, and
Georze IV, as Prince of Wales, had seen
and known him in those days.
It is related in the 'Memoirs of Charles
Mathews," the comedian, that in July,
1821, when George had succeeded to tne
throne, he, previous to being crowned, ob
tained an interview with Borulwaski, and
In a most deiicate manner offered him any!
pecuniary help if he needed it to make his
latter days comfortable. He ordered that
his coronation robes should be shown to
the little Count, and as a favorite valet of
the King was dying, who remembered the
dwarf, Boruiwaski visited his sick cham
ber at the request of Georere IV. On his
death, on September 5, 1837, Count Borul
waski's remains were laid in the Chapel of
the Nine Altars at Durham Cathedral. â

A Pack of Wolves in Wisconsin.
A correspondent writes from Ashland,
\Yi~., about a puck of wolves that gathered
around his camp at night. Maeua, or
Ernest, the Indian guide, was sleeping,
when all of a sudden he leaped to his feet
and began to pile wood on the fire with a
naste that surprised the white man. When
the flames were crawling rapidly up
through the wood the Indian explained
that wolves were down in the swamp
howling. The white man wouldn't be
lieve it, as he bad not heard anything.
The Indian said, "You see, pretty quiet,"
and tethered the horses between the
wagon and fire.
Then the wolves came within hearing of
the white man, sending chills up his back
with their long, undulating howl. The
horses shook the tree to which they had
been tethered with their violent trembling.
Then suddenly all was still. The wolves,
some of which had come within fifteen
paces of the camp-fire, sneaked away
silently, baffl?d in their search for horse
flesh by the flames. â Forest and Stream.

CLOSE FINISHES
AT OAKLAND
The Luck Still Follows in
the Wake of the
Favorites.
Little Cripple Hard Ridden to
Beat t c 15 to I Out
sider, Coda.
Shield Bearer Liked tfae H-avy Going*
Torsina Beat the Favorite, Sir
Play, in a Gal op-
It is not very tempting to the owner of
a good handicap horse to see boys gather
ing up stones in buckets between races,
yet that was the sight presented at Oak
land track yesterday. The top dressing oi
dark loam put on the new course seems to
be full of small stones, and the gallopers
are continually raisinc them to the sur
face. Already it is said one or two horses
nave been lamed by stepping on them,
and this in part no doubt accounts for the
scarcity of good horse- starting.
The weather in the afternoon was clear
and cool; and although the track was
slow, the finishes in nearly every instance
were close Â«nd exciting. The favorites
found the road rough and rocky, for but
two returned with the coin.
The brown colt Inflammator, who seems
to have strut Â£ a winning clip, repaid his
backers well by beating the even money
choice Principle out a nose at odds of 12
tol.
It was only by the narrowest of margins |
that Little Cripple, heavily supported at
evens, took the mile selling affair. Coda,
a 15 to 1 shot, made all the running, and,
hanging on stubbornly, was just ncsecl
out on the wire by the "favorite, on which
Bob Isom was compelled to do some very
tall hustling. Navy Blue was third. The
start was a very poor one, Bombazette and
HeasJde being turned sideways when the
barrier flew up.
Frank Phillip's mud-runner. Shield
Bearer, carried tiie buiK of the coin bet on
the eight starters in the six-furlong run j
that followed, ana, leading lrom the jump, j
reached the wire a neck before the 15 to 1
outsider, Fiaslilight, well ridden by
Al Sbaw. Doubtful, bacKed from 15 and
20 to 1 down to 8, was a poor third.
The big bettors were badiy dumped over
the result of the seven-furlong purse event.
Sir Play was backed for big bundles of
wealth to win, and at one time his chances
looked most favorable. Racing away in
the lead with Johnny McHale ihe second
choice, he shook him off in the stretch,
only to be pas-ed by Tur^ina and beaten
out with ease. Johnny McHale hung on
gamely, finishing but a nose lurther away.
The Burns and Waterhouse entry Miulo
was a prohibitive 2 to 5 chance for the con
cluding six-furlone run, and cut a very
sorry figure. Hymn, tue second choice,
made a runaway r;sce of it, jogging in tbe
handiest of winners from Kicardo. The
favorite was a distant third.

INVOLVES A TELESCOPE.
.Rehearing Ordered by the Supremo
Court in the Case of Spence
Against "Wiilney-
The Supreme Court has granted a re
hearing in the matter of Anna M. Spence,
executrix of the last will of E. F. Spence,
deceased, against Wi iney and others, re
versing the decision of October 16 last.
Spence deeded lands to a board of trustees,
to provide an extensive astronomical ob
servatory and equipment for the Univer
sity of Bouthern California. Speuce was
one of the trustees. The necessary funds
were not raised to meet the payments for
lenses for the treat telescope as they ar
rived from Europe, and after some deliber
ation it was decided to sell them to the
University of Chicago, where they now
are. Mrs. Bpence wants to obtain posses
sion of the land. The case was decided
just about one month iigo, but, on peti
tion, a rehearing hns been ordered before
the court in bank. Whether tlie University
of Soutnern California will ever get teles
copic facilities from the Spence property
is still uncertain.
A. New Lifeboat.
Major Blnkeney of the life-saving service
called for bids for the construction of another
boat for the life-savin? station at GoMen Gate
Park. It is to be self- bailing and self-righting
nnd twenty-eight feet lone The present boat
is too heavy to pull over the beach sands. The
new boat will weigh a little over a ton. The
old boat, which is one of ihe besi on the coast,
will probably be sent to the new Point Bonita
station when the station is built. It can there
be launched from the ways, which will be sim
itar in many respects to those at the Presidio.
The new boat will be built after the model ot
the old boat.

JUDGE McKENNA ON THE EVE
OF MAKING A GREAT DECISION
The Fate and Powers of the Railroad Commission
of California Will Be Determined
Within a Few Days.
Now Engaged in Putting the
Finishing Touches on the
Manuscript.-
FOUR BIG POINTS INVOLVED-
One of the Leading Law Journals
Roasts District Attorney Foote
for His Course.
Within a day or two, or at most within
a week, Judge Joseph McKenna of the
United States Circuit Court will hand
down his decision in the case oT the South
ern Pacific Company against the Board of j
Railroad Commissioners of the State of 1
California.
He has been at work on this for some
time past, and bis labors are now about
concluded. The decision will be one of
the longest rendered by any court in Cali
fornia.
This suit, involving some of the most
important and interesting questions ever
brought before a tribunal, was instituted
early in October, 1895, went to trial on the
10th of December of the same year, and
was submitted lor decision May 20 of this
year. The action was drought to prevent
the Railroad Commission from reducing
the grain rates of the complainant 8 per
cent.
It was contended on the part of the cor
poration that certain language in section
22 if article Xil of the Stute constitution, j
defining the powers aud duties of the !
commission, rendered that body uncon- j
stitutional. The language complained of â 
is as follows:
"In all controversies, civil or criminal,
the rates of lares and freights established
by said commssion shall be deemed con
clusively just and reasonable."
It was urged that this virtually gave the â 
commission confiscatory powers.
It was also contended by tbe comnlain
ant that tne proposed 8 per cent reduction i
on grain rates was unjust and unreason
able.
On the part of tbe State, represented by I
Attorney-General Fitzgerald, ex-Judge j
Hayne and W. W. Foote, it was argued
that complainant had no standing in
court ; first, because its leases of the lessor
corporations comprising the Southern
Pacific Company were void, a^ corporation
franchises granted by Congress or by a i
Legislature could not be transferred with- I
out the consent of tbe granting power, '
and, second, because the consolidation of
ah the interests of these lessor corpora
tions wa<v in violation of section 20 of
article XJ.I of the State constitution,
which provides as follows:
No railroad company or common carrier
sbail combine or make any contract wiih the
owners ol any vessel that leaves port or makes
port in this State, or with any common carrier,
by which combination or contract the earn
ings 01 ouc doing the carrying are to be shared
by ihe other net doing the carrying.
Judge McKenna has, therefore, four
great points to decide. Are the leases of
the railroad companies he>d by the
Southern Pacific Company valid, in view |
of the laws requiring the sanction of the j
grantors in making transfers of properties !
operated under franchises? Is the j
Suuthern Pacilic Company a legal. y con
stitutec 1 corporation, in view of the State
constitutional provision a-ainstcombina- I
tions by common carrier corporations? Is
the Railroad Commission a constitutional j
body? Are the grain rates established by
tbe commission just and reasonable?
Tbe real merits ot the issue lie in the
latter proposition, and before the court
comes to this it will have to pass on the
other three questions in the order men
tioned. What most concerns the people |
of California, however, is the status of
the commission, for should all the other
questions be decided in favor of the rail
road company and the constitutionality
of the commission upheld there would
still remain the machinery tor bringing
relief to the shippers of the State.
It is the general impression among tbe
legal proiession who either beard or read
the arguments in tue case that tue con
stitutionality of the commission will be
sustained.
This impression is largely due to the
stand taken and remarks made by the
court during the argument of Attorney-
General Fitzgerald. The Attorney-Gen
eral argued that if the provision of trie
State constitution declaring all rate hxed
by the commission to be "conclusively
just and reasonable" is in conflict with
the fourteenth amendment of tiie consti
tution of the United States such provision
can be rejected by the court and the rest
of the sect;on upheld. He was citing
cases to illustrate this point when the
court interrupted, saying:
'â¢General, the principle you are con
tending for is not denied, * â¢ * so it
is hardly worth while to take up time in
reading those decisions.''
Widespread attention throughout the
United State* has been given to this case,
and the decision of Judge McKenna is
awaited with deep curiosity among the
legal fraternity. In speaking of the case,
and particularly of the intervention ot the
United States to protect its interests in the
Central Pacific Railroad Company, the
American Law Review, one of the leading
publications of its class in the United
States, in its issue of January-February
1896, said :
It is needless to say that public opinion In
Calilornia almost unanimously condemned
this move on the part of the l nited Siatts Dis
trict Attorney, and statements were freely
made in the California lay press to the effect
that the bill of intervention had been con
cocted in the law office of the Southern P&cinc
Company.
Further along the Review says:
It would seem that a sincere purpose on the
part of the law officers of the United States to
right the wrong done to the United States and
to prevent interference by the State of Cali
fornia with the rights of the United States
would lead them to bring the proper action to
dissolve this ultra vir s lease (the ie> scote ot the
Central Pacific Railroad Company to the
Southern Pacific Company), and 10 rehabili
tate the directors ol the Central Pacific Rail
road Company in the possession of their own
properties and in the discharge of their public
duties.
In its later issue of May-June, 1896, the
Review, referring again to the interven
tion ol United States District Attorney
Foote, says it was "nominally on behalf
of the United States, but really a make
weight for the railroad company." Con
tinuing it comments as follows:
The arguments of Attorney-General Fitzger
ald and his colleague. ex-Judge Hayne, are
said to nave been most convincing. The argu
ments, taken together, are said to comprehend
the most thorough and exhaustive presenta
tion of the laws relating to tbe organization
and existence, earnings and rights of trans
portation, rights and liabilities of the Central
Pacific Railroad company and the Southern
Pacific Company or Kentucky, alias tue "octo
pus, that has ever, or will ever be., presented
in any court.
Referring to "the lease of the Central
Pacific Railroad to the Kentucky mon
strosity" the article concludes as follows:
If the Department of Justice had shown one
tenth of the alacrity in favor of the riehis of
the United States which the United States At
torney for the Northern District of California
has shown in intervening in this proceeding
under ihe pretense of saying the rights of the
Government, the real object being to help the
railroad monopoly, a quo warranto on the re
lation of the Aitorney-Cieneral of the United
Slates would have dissolved this Infamous
lease soon after It was made.
However the decision turns it is likely
an appeal will be taken.
AGAINST POOL-SELLING.
Churches of Alameda County to Pro
test Against Gambling at the
Emeryville Racetrack.
The question of pool-selling at the Em
eryville racetrack was vigorously agitated
at the Methodist preachers' meeting held
at the Y. M. C. A. Monday. It was re
solved to create a feeling throughout Ala
meda County, if possible. Dr. B'>vard has
appointed a committee of one to circulate
petitions in the churches, in order to pre
sent a list of many thousands of signa
tures to the Supervisors. The Congrega
tional and Baptist ministers, being in ses
sion yesterday, were visited by Dr. Bovard
and both bodies promised their co-opera
tion. An effort will be made to circulate
petitions among the churches of other de
nominations throughout Alameda County.
The paper of ttie day at the Methodist
preachers' meeting was an able account of
the '"Internal Evidences of the Inspira
tion of the Scriptures," by Rev. Alfred
Kummer.
Rev. T. C. BakÂ«r of the Children's Home
Finding Society discussed "The Child
Problem" at the Baptist Preachers' Con
ference yesterday. The great superiority
of tbe home over the public institution as
a means of bringing up children was
pointed out. Â»
Rev. Dr. Williams addressed the Con
gregational Monday Club on training
children in the church. He considered
that tbe church owed a great duty to the
youne and that all its obligations were not
summed up in Ihe Sunday-school and the
Cnristian Endeavor societies.

Rev. S. S. Palmer analyzed agnosticism,

of a spiritual paralysis.

cided to Cut Through the Hill First
and Grade Afterward.
The committee appointed by the Polk
street Improvement Club to whicn was
left the matter of cutting down the hili at
the northern end of the street met yes
terday afternoon and decided to ask the

work of opening the street right through

Chairman Bradbury was at first dis
posed to have an official grade established

but on second consideration he changed

mitteemen to remove the bump now and
in the meantime work for the grade.

VERDICT FOR SAILORS.
Men Who Went to Alaska Get Judg
ment Against the Alaska Pack
ers' Association.
Sixty-eight sailors and fishermen who
are suing the Alaska Packers' Association
were made glad yesterday by the decision
of Justice of the Peace Barry in tha
case of FranK Johnson against tbe corpo
ration.
The men shipped on March 5 last on a
salmon-fishing trip to Alaska. They dis
agreed with the company because they
were not permitted to fish when oppor
tunity offered and refused to work fur
ther, wnereupon they were discharged by
the company and sent back to San Fran
cisco.
They claimed $191 each as compensation
for the trip, while the company alleged
tbat only $166 80 was due for labor per
formed, ana that each man was indebted
to the company in the sum of $92 55 for
board, supplies and fare home, reducing
the accounts to $74 25 each, which was ten
dered the men.
The court accepted the claim of tbe men
as to the amount due and allowed the
counter claim of the company, giving a
judgment in Johnson's case for $99 25.
The other cases being exactly similar
each man will receive that amouiit.
THE CHOSEN FRIENDS.
Two Members of the Order fteceive the
Miuii'v Due Them at Seventy-Five.
There was a lartre gathering of tbe mem
bers of Central Council No. 4, Order of
Chosen Friends, and invited gueets in
Social Hall, Alcazar building, last night
to witness the presentation of checks to
two members of tbe council who had
reached the old-age limit.
These are Samuel Figel and J. Oben
hauer, who had attained the age of sev-
Samuel FigeL
en f y-five years and were entitled to re
ceive $:iUOO each, plus a small addition in
the way of return of premium paid in ex
cess of a stated amount. In the early
part of the evening there waa music, reci
tations and dancing. Among tbo-e who
p rticipated were Max Levy, who rendered
"Answer" and "Cast Aside"; Miss Rose
Cohen, who recitel "The Blacksmith's
Story," and N. A. Neale, who sang ''Open
Tby Lattice"; Miss Minnie Byrne, accom
panist. Then PaÃt Supreme Councilor C.
M. Arnold delivered a short address, ex
plaining the order and its methods of
offering protection to its members, alter
which he presented the checks for ihe
s.ims allowed each of the beneficiaries.
The one was handed to Mr. Obenbauer in
person and the other to a sou of Mr. Figel,
who was taken suddenly ill yesterday aft
ernoon. The recipients acknowledged the
presentation in a few suitable words. This
was followed by aancing until midnight.
A HYPNOTIC SLEEP.
Cheshire Slumbers Regardless of Noise
or Human Touch.
A large audience gathered at the Bush
street Theater last night to see Kennedy
in his hypnotic performance, the particular
attraction being tne trance feature of the
show. This feature was embraced in the
ca;aleptlc sleep of George Cbeshire, who
was hypnotized on Sunday night with a
promise that be would not be aroused for
an entire week.
During the day several thousand people
and many doctors viewed the siumberer
and tried to awaken him, all in vain. The
registrations on the book showed that the
slumberer's pulse had gone down graduÂ»
ally since he was first placed under con
trol, and that his respiration bad been
under normal.
Cheshire was fed beef tea twice during
the day, but at no time did he open bis
eyes nor were the eyeballs found to be
sensitive to the touch.

Hayman Company and Frtedlarder, Gott
lob & Co., whereby all Pacihc Coast 1 usi.
ness is cooled, and profits and expenses
are to be shared according to a previously

tbe consolidation has gone as far as that,
however, but they admit that something
like it has been agreed upon.

Third ballotâ Stockton 3, Alnmeda

The foregoing ballots were taken by the
Board of University Regents at the Mark
Hopkins Institute yesterday afternoon to
determine the location of the Wilmerdine
School. Governor Budd cast tbe eleventh
vote on the third ballot which gave San
Francisco the majority, and then declared
the result in favor of this City.
The regents voting for San Francisco on
the third and final ballot were William T.
Jeter, E. A. Deuicke, C. F. Crocker, H. S.
Foote, George T. Marye, T. G. Phelps, J.
B. Reinstein, Arthur Rodgers, C. W.
Slack, William T. Wallace and Governor
Budd.
The three votes for Stockton came from
Lynch, Chase and John Â£. Budd.
The regents voting for the university
site were Halidie, Hellman, Martin, Mil
ler and Way mire.
Regents Kellogg and Rowell voted for
Alameda County.
The votes for Stockton on tbe first bal
lot were cast by Governor Budd, Lynch,
Chase, Foote and John Â£. Budd.
J. C. Wilmerding, in bis will, gave $4C0,
--000 to establish a trade school for boys,
indicating a desire that the boys
should have little study and plenty ol
work. The trust was confided to the Re
gents. As the bequest did not stipulate
that the school should be established in
San Francisco a strong pressure was ex
erted to secure its location elsewhere.
Last February a majority of a special
committee on sites reported in favor of
establishing the school on a tract of land
in Temescal, bnt the report was not
adopted by the board. After much dis
cussion tbe whole subject-matter was
postponed until after the election. Yes
terday at the hour appointed for settling
the question only two regentsâ S. T.
Black and J. F. Honghtonâ were absent.
Twenty-one responded to the rollcall.
Chester Rowell came from Fresno, Jobn
C. Lynch from San Bernardino, Jobn E.
Budd from Stockton and William T. Jeter
from Santa Cruz to attend the session.
The r. gents ta ked from 1:30 until 5
p. m. Messrs. Martin, Hallidie, Governor
Budd, Phelps, Rodgers and Wallace made
elaborate arguments. As a preliminary
step the regents resolved that the scnool
be established to teach trades.
J. West Martin opened the discussion
on behalf of the Temescal site of seven
acres. He read Irom printed pages. He
spoke of the bequest as the grandest dis
position of surplus wealth ever made, ash
was a step toward the emancipation of
youth from trade despotism. He hoped
it was not the policy of San Francisco to
absorb everything and ignore the sub
urban towns.
Timothy Guy Phelps anoke for San Fran
cisco and made a strong and lucid argu
ment. He produced a lever from Irving M.
Scott to sustain his position. He held that
the school should be established In the
midst of tne din of manufacturing industry
and in the \ lace where the greatest n umb er
of boys could be reached. Mr. Wilmerding
desired to reach the idle boys, and it was
in these boys that the speaker was inter
ested. Many of them were boys of bright
intellect. Some time ago the board was
addressed by a man who made a sneering
allusion to these boys of tbe street. "I
ielt sorry for that man," said Mr. Phelps. 1
"He would have sneered at Abraham
Lincoln in bis mil-splitting garb. He
would have sneered at U. S. Grant."
Governor Budd replied that the whole
drift of discusMon seemed to imply that
the regents were to execute a local trust.
San Francisco only was mentioned. The
rest of the State was ignored. He wanted
to know if any rich man of San Francisco
had come forward with the offer of a site.
The Governor spoke of tbe many advan
tages which Stockton possessed, and tbe
readiness o. her people to provide land
and buildings for me school.
Reference was made to tbe absorbing in
clinations of Alameda County. The sum
of $750,000 was soon to be expended at
Berkeley and Reinstein knew where an
other large sumâ perhaps a million â was
comiug from. The Governor was afraid
that the people of Alameda County were
trying to emulate the animal that was
diiven into the sea.
Arthur Rodgers said the main purpose
of tbe regents should be to ascertain what
the benefactor desired, and in good faith
execute the wishes of the donor. "We
should establish again and again tbe prin
ciple that we carry out the wishes of a
benefactor. We snould be true to the
trust and locate the school where Mr.
Wilmerding saw the idle boys. We should
be honest 10 the man who made the gift."
Georee T. Marye recalled to the atten
tion of the regents the letters which Wil
liam Alvord, Thomas J. Lamb and C. F.
Fargo had written. When it was sug
gested to Mr. Wilmerding that the Po
trero would be a good place he remarked,
"That's right; tbe Fotrero is the place for
it" As a meichant and resident of San
Francisco for forty years Mr. Wiimerding
had this City in view.
A. S. Hallidie read a carefully prepared
paper on the subject, directing particular
attention to the lact that Mr. Wilmerding
left the choice of the site to the regent?.
Mr. Hallidie held that it was a mistaken
idea that the school was designed for the
street arabs and neither was it a mission
ary school.
Judge Wallace's line of argument was
that Mr. Wilmerding had no other place
than San Francisco in view. He iived
here for forty years- It was his first inten
tion to five $400,000 to tbe Art Associa
tion, but hearing of Mr. Searles' munifi
cent gift be said to himself, "What eiÂ«e
can I do for San Francisco?"
"It never entered his mind or the mind
of h:s associates to designate a site; that
was implied. Why should Wilmerdiug
exclude San Francisco? If a rich man of
Stockton â a man who had liyed there
forty yearsâ should die and leave $400,000
for a trade school my modesty would not
allow me to go there an 1 ask for tbe
money for a school in San Francisco. I
couldn't have tbe tace to do a. Ii would
break me down."
Judge Wallace's remarks elicited some
merriment at the expense of the Governor
and called out a spirited reply from the
latter. The Judge insisted that there was
nothine but surmise or conjecture that
Mr. Wilmerding had any other place than
ban Francisco in mind.
Governor Budd warmly resented the
suggestion that the interior was brazen
faced in asking for the Wilmerding School.
He was surprised at Judge Wallace's re
mark, as that regent had asked other
towns to present offers. "On his own
motion Stockton was included, yet he says
we are brazen-faced for asking the loca
tion.'
Judge Wallaceâ l did not say brazen
faced.
Governor Burtd (turning to James D.
Phelan)â Whv, your Mayor-elect pre
sented the offer of a site from San Jose.
Under their oath the regents primarily
declared that other towns had as much
right as San Francisco to enter the com
petition. It may be unfortuuate that San
Francisco has absorbed the majority of
tbe regents, as she absorbs everything
?i. se - We in Stockton can do without tiie
\Y ilmerdine School. We can stand upon
our own footing. But I warn this board
against stirring up sectional strife, for San
Francisco, while holding a majority here,
does not hold a majority in the Legis
lature.
Regent Reinsteinâ lam sure that Judge
Wallace bad no intention of reflecting on
the interior, and I regret that any sec
tional feeling â
Judge Wallaceâ What is that about
feeling?
Governor Buddâ There is no feeling.
Judge Wallace offered the resolution for
the interior to enter the list. There is no
thought of feeling. [Laughter.]
John E. Buddâ Judge Wallace's remark
wa* mere pleasantry.
Everybody laughed, and Mr. Reinstein
said he would accept the peace-iraker's
reward of getting a pelting from both
sides.
Regent Hellman said he would vote for
the Berkeley site beciiuse the |400,000
would not be adequate for the school in
San Francisco.
Regent Denicke produced figures to show
that the land and buildings could be ob
tained for $100,000.
Judge Wayniire believed that Mr. Wil
merding purposely omitted the location
in order to ieavethe subject to the discre
tion of tbe regents. The weight of ar
gument, to Judge Waymire's mind, was
in favor of Berkeley.
Regent Footeâ lf I believed that the
weight of testimony indicated that Mr.
Wilmerding preferred San Francisco I
should po vote for this City, but to my
mind it is just the contrary and 1 shall
vote for Stockton.
When San Francisco was chosen on the
third ballot John E. Budd moved to make
the choice unanimous and the motion pre
vailed. One vote for Los Angeles was cast
by J. C. Lynch.
The Board of Regents held a secret ses
sion yesterday lorenoon and adjusted all
the complications concernme contracts
for building the Affiliated C'oliezes. The
session was attended by the Governor,
Attorn-y-General Fitzgerald and Warden
Aull of Folsom prison.
The contracts will be approved in due
form by the Attorney-General, but Fol
som granite will be omitted.
There is a reservation that the retents
may use granite quarried at Folsom, pro
vided such use will inure exclusively to
the benefit of the State and shall not be
to the advantage of the contractor. The
Attorney-General does not recede from
his position against the use of prison
labor in cutting the stone.
The sense 01 the agreement reached in
executive session may be put in tbe form
of a resolution for record on the minutes.
Regents who attended the session gave
out the assurance to contractors and
others that the work would go ahead now
without delay.
HINTON HIGHLY HONORED.
His Ability Causes Him to Be Selected
for a Position of Great
Trust.
E. H. Ilinton, who for three years past
most ably represented the Panama Rail
road Company in this City, has been elected
a member of the board of administration
of the Southwestern Traffic Association,
on the recommendation of the Southern
Pacific Company. The news of this good
fortune for Mr. Hinton came in a dispatch
to The Call from St. Louis, the headquar
ters ol the association. Mr. Hinton con
firmed the announcement yesterday in an
interview, in which he said:
It is true that I have been elected by the
associated lines of the Southwestern Trhffic
Association as a member ol the board of ad
ministration of that body. 1 had many years'
experience with the lines of the Southwest,
and particularly witn the tn.ffie affairs of tue
Texas lines. It was not unnatural, therefore
that I should wish to return to a field with
which I was so familiar, and when a vacancy
occurred on ;he board of administration ot
tue Southwestern Association a short time ago
I applied for the place. The association has
paid me ihe compliment of electing me, said
election requiring the unanimous vote of the
interested lines.
As to the agency of the Panama Railroad
Company here 1 uo not know what will be
done. The Panama railroad officia.s nave baid
nothing to me about my successor.
Mr. Hinton has already forwarded his
resignation to the Panama Company and
exnects to leave for the new held of his
labors on Saturday.
The position he is expected to fill is one
of the most important in the railroad
world of this country. It is only .within
the past year that the great railroads of
the country have adopted tbe idea of
boards of arbitration, whose duty it is to
pass upon the tariffs of the companies m
terestei and thus prevent destructive com
petition, and at tbe same time avoid any
contravention of the interstate commerce
law which prohibits pooling.
On the board of the Southwestern
Traffic Association there are six members,
and Mr. Htnton was elected to nil the
vacancy caused by the death of J. Waldo.
Among the roads in this association are
the Humington properties, known as the
Southern Pacific, San Antonio and Aran
bus Pass, Houston and Texas Central and
the Morgan line of steamers; the Gould
lines, known as the Missouri Pacific; the
St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern,
T.-xas and Pacific and International and
Great Northern ; Hetty Green's Texas Mid
land, and tbe Fort Worth and Rio Grande,
St. Louis and San Francisco, Atchison,
Topeka and Santa Fe, Gulf, Colorado and
Santa Fe; St. Louis Southwestern. Forth
Worh and Den ver. The association has juris
diction of all business originating in or de
stined to any point in Texas.
The new member of the board has had
a long ami successful experience in rail
road traffic business. He was formerly
general freiuht agent of the Texas Pacific
for five years.
This position he held from 1837 to 1892.
Early in 1893 he came to this Cuv as tbe
general agent of the Panama Railroad
Company, and so well did tie look af it
the interests of his company that, as one
of the prominent railroad men of this City
remarked, "he kept the water boiling
about the Pacific Mail Steamsnip Com
pany."
It U the general opinion among the
local railroad representatives of Eastern
lines that it was the acumen and ability
Mr. Hinton displayed in holding up his
company's end in tbe contest whicn was
for years waged with the powerful Pacific
Mail Company that drew the attention of
