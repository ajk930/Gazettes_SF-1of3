NOW CERTAIN OF ELECTION
Major McKinley Destined to
Be the Next President.
SILVERITES ALREADY BEATEN.
Result of the Battle of the Ballots
To-Morrow Will Be a Land
slide to Republicans.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Not. I.â Vice-chairman Apsley of the Republican Con
, gressional Committee left Washington to-day for bit home at Hudinn, Man., to
cast his vote.
\ "You may say for me," said Mr. Apsley on taking the train, "that I stand by
my former prediction that the Republican ticket will be triumphant by more than
325 Totes in the Electoral College ; that, in fact, McKinley'i election will be
marked by a landslide, and that 1 have not modified my estimate of the election
of 234 souud-money Republicans to the House."
CANTON, Ohio, Nov. I.â A delegation
of over 100 voters from Detroit arrived in
Canton this morning to pay their respects
to Major McKinley. The delegation bad
intended to reach here on Saturday, but
were delayed by bad railroad connections.
They attended services at the First Meth
odist Episcopal Church in a body and in
the afternoon the members of the Detroit
party called in small groups unon Major
McKinley at his residence. There were
no formal addresses and the visitors left
quietly for their homes this evening.
Major McKinley, in company with Mrs.
Thomas McDougal and John W. Warren
ton of Cincinnati, were also present at the
morning services at the First Methodist
E; iscopal Church.
Major McKinley is confident to-night.
Tbe expectation of victory proves a won
derful tonic and restorative. The last
week of the campaign was in some ways
the hardest of his many weeks of arduous
work. Delegations were not so large, as a
rule, but they were very numerous and
the number of people who strenuously in
sisted on personal interviews with the
Republican candidate was greater than
ever.
Then, too, Major MrKlnley found addi
tional cause for anxiety in tbe illness of
Mrs. McKinley, who for tbe last five days
has been confined to her bed with a severe
cold. To-day, however, Mrs. McKinley
was much improved and was able to sit up
for a time. To-night Major MeKinley is
in the best of spirits and seenia to be
thoroughly rested. He said he could
scarcely realize that the fight was over
and that tie had made nearly 250 speeches.
Cbauncey M. Depew said when he was
here that, after seeing the crowds at Can
ton, and feeling the excitement with which
the air is charged, he was confident he
could not stand the life here lonprer than a
week if he had to do half ot what Mc-
Kinley has been doing daily since his
nomination.
Major McKinley said this evening: "I
expect to make the last speech of tbe cam
paign to my tellow-townsmen on Monday
night. It has been my practice for many
years to speak in Canton the night before
the election."
The people of Canton will call in a body
Monday evening and Major McKinley wiil
address them from the stand in his front
yard.
A great volume of cheering news has
been pouring in upon Major McKinley all
day. He has received final and reassuring
reports from West Virginia, Maryland,
Kentucky, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota,
Nebraska, lowa, Kansas, North Dakota,
South Dakota, California, Oregon, Wash
ington and Missouri. The news from all
ot these States was thoroughly satisfac
tory with the exception of two. There is
some doubt expressed about Kansas and
Missouri, but in tbe event of a general
landslide Major McKinley's friends here
Bay he will carry both of t:iem.
Major McKinley has been requested to
press the button which shall set in motion
the machinery of the 'ionawanda Iron
and Steel Works on Thursday next, and
will probably do so.

CHICAGO, 111., Nov. I.â The National
headquarters of both parties were almost
deserted to-day. There was no business
of importance to transact. Members of
tbe campaign committees and heads of
departments had either gone home to
vote or were preparing to leave the head
quarters urn il after the decisive day, and
were at their desk> for a short time only
in the afternoon, wnile few visitors Irom
outside Chicago strayed in to tell po itical
news or to be informed before going to
their homes to vote.
Chairman Hanna will remain at his post
here until to-morrow evening, when he
will depart for Cleveland and receive the
returns there. Wednesday he proposes to
visit Major McKinlpy and then go to New
York, to return here early next week and
wind up the strictly business affairs. Each
of the several hundred 1 employes called to
bid him goort-by last night, ana to each of
tnem Mr. Hanna presented bis portrait
and autograph.. Mr. Hanna has made a
popular campaign chairman.
Executive Committeeman Durbin left
yesterday for Indianapolis to examine the
Indiana siiuation with the Slate Commit
tee and then go to Anderson to vote.
Chief Harm and his subordinates in the
speakers' department left to-day for their
Ohio homes. Major Dick, secretary of the
National Committee, aeparted to-day for
his home in Akron, Ohio. Commit'.eeman
Payne will leave for Milwaukee to-morrow
â¢ afternoon, and Colonel Haskell, sergeant-
at-arms of the headquarters, has gone to

a gold Democrat, and to Chief Hahn Presi
dent Hill expressed confidence that Mc-
Kinley would be elected and said St. Paul
would give a big Republican majority.
Commenting on the charges of intimi
dation of railroad employes, Mr. Hill said
railroad men were too independent to be
coerced; they would vote as they pleased,
and because they were honest men as a
class ana in favor of good money, the
same as he was, he believed the bulk of
the railroad men would vote for McKin
ley.
Secretary Walsh of the Democratic Com
mittee is still absent in lowa, whither he
accompanied Mr. Bryan, but he will re
turn to headquarters to-morrow. Cam
paign Committeeman Johnson of Kansas
does not consider his State, is in such
doubt as to make his vote necessary, and
will remain heie until he knows the news.
Campaign Chairman Campau went home
to Detroit yesterday to vote and put the
finishing touches on Michigan.
Sunday was not observed as a day of
rest by the campaign orators in Chicago.
Dozens of ward and bigger meetings and
club parades were held in all parts of the
city, and local orators expounded the
arguments in favor of McKinley, Bryan
and Palmer and their platforms day and
night.

INDIANS ARE AROUSED.
Voter* Will Inaure an Over helming Re
publicm Majority.
INDIANAPOLIS, â¢ Ikd , Not. I.âChair
man Gowdy of the Republican State Com
mittee this afternoon furnished the follow
ing signed statement: * *'
â¢The campaign of 1896 will -be recorded as
one of the greatest contests In the history of
j Indiana politics. Tuesday the voters will
settle by ballot the issue upon which this
campaign has been made. The people of In
diana realize 'that the country is threatened
with a crisis which can be averted only by the'
defeat of the free silver Democratic party.
And with an abiding faun in the intelligence
and patriotism of the people we are confident
that the result will be one of the most decisive
| victories in favor of. the Republicans ever
j given to any party in the State.
A conservative estimate of the situation at
this time shows that Indiana will give a Re
publican plurality of not less than 25.000.
and if, as we have reason to believe, a large
percentage of the silent vote Is cast for the Re
publ.ran ticket the plurality may reach
60.000.
The Republican organization in Indiana is
so compact and perfect in every detail that
we do not believe that an attempt by the ad
vocates of free silver by corruption or other
methods can effect any material change in the
situation.
The Republicans will elect all of the 13 Con
gressmen, 61 members of the lower house ot
the general? assembly and 16 out of tbe 25
Senators to elect. With the 19 Republican
bold-over Republican Senators this will give
us 35 in tbe Senate, a mnjority of 20. Tbe Re
publicans will have a majority of 22 in the
House, giving us a majority on joint ballot ot
42. This will insure the election of a Repub
lican to the United States Senate to succeed
Daniel W. Voorhees.
AND SENATOR QUAY SMILES.
He Does Xot See How 31 eKitiley Can Be
Beaten. â 
WASHINGTON, D. C., Nov. I.â Senator
Quay came down to Washington to-day
fora few hours, leaving in the evening for
his borne at Beaver, Pa., where he intends
to vote.
"How much money have you bet on
McKinley?" It was Senator Quay who
put the question. He had just been sa
luted by an intimate friend. ' The latter
replied: "Nothing."
"Nothing?" Quay coming as near to an
exclamation as he ever does, responded:
"And why not?"
"Bryan man wants too big odds," said
the friend.
"Well," quoted Quay, "and pray what
does it matter how much odds yon give
when you are betting on a sure thing?"
The friend then admitted that he was
i out of money anyhow; whereat the Sen-
I ator smiled in sympathy, as one who feels
for a friend who has missed the opportu
nity of bis life. Then he added: "Why,
that's too bad. it's all settled, you know.
There is not tbe slightest doubt about it.
iicKlnley is as good as elected. Nothing
can prevent it."
"The Middle West," began the friend,
but Quay caught him up with: "Tbe
Middle West are sure; our friends in
charge out there are hilarious. What are
the Poncrats claiming here?"
"Well," said the friend, "they scoff at
the talk of McKinley getting Kentucky
and "
"You don't mean to say that the Pops
honestly think that they are going to
carry Kentucky for Bryan?"
And when the friend nodded the Sen
ator smothered a smile with bis band.
BETTING OF TH E ELECTION.
Democrat* Afraid to Cover all the
WÂ»a*r* 3lnde by Republican*.
CHICAGO, Ilu, Nov. Lâ ln Chicago
betting on the result of next Tuesday's
election has not been very heavy, ana the
wagers made were not very large. Around
the resorts where speculative men congre
eate there seems to be plenty of McKinlev
money. At the Saratoga Hotel, where
SAN FRANCISCO, MONDAY MORNING, NOVEMBER 2, IS9Â«.
many Bryanitet are registered, the most
noticeable bet made yesterday was by a
Nebraska man, who offered $600 even that
Bryan would not carry his own State. It
was promptly taken by a man from Texas.
Und -r telegraphic instructions from St.
Louis William Mangier is requested to
place $1000 against Aitpeld, and slight
odds will be given if necessary to get some
of the Governor's adherents to come to
the front. The principal feature of the
betting is that as to whether Bryan wiil
carry Nebraska, called forth by Chairman
Jones' table, in which that Commonwealth
is placed in the sure Bryan column. To
morrow it is expected there will be a
bo m in the speculative game.
BT. LOUIS, Mo., Nov. I.â Publicity has
not been sought to a grr-at extent by those
who have wagered on the outcome of the
election, but some good-sized bets have
been made. Mos s Fraley, a prominent
Board of Trade man, has placed $3000
against $1000 on McKinley for President.
At tiie Planters' Ho el $10 000 is loceed
in the safe to bet on McKsnley at odds ot
3 to 1. Colonel W. Gi Wet more, vice
president of tbe Liggett <fc Meyers Tobacco
Company, bet $500 to $1000 with a Chicago
man that Aligeld would be elected Gov
ernor of Illinois.
CLOSED IN NEW YORK.
Spiritle** Campaign of Democrat* Dun
to Certain Republican Succ *Â».
NEW YORK, N. V., November I.â The
campaign closed in this State last night.
The Democrats have managed the cam
paign for Bryan and Sewall in a seemingly
perfunctory way. With Senator Hill's
silence, W.lliara C. Whitney, an avowed
McKinley man, and ex-Governor Roswell
P. Flower and other leaders stumping
for Palmer and Backner, it has been a
spiritless campaign.
The National Democrats have con
ducted a warm campaign for Palmer and
Buckner and are confident of making a
showing at the polls which will justify
them in continuing the organization for
future work.
The Prohibition and Socialist-Labor
parties have made their nsual quiet cam
paigns. The People's party, after vain
efforts to obtain recognition on the Demo
cratic electoral ticket, indorsed the .Bryan
and Sewall electors and too* down their
State ticket, with the exception of their
nominee for Judge of the Court of Ap
peals.
The Republicans expect to carry the
State for McKinley by from 200,000 up
ward. They expect to elect Frank S.
Black Governor and to capture the Con
gressional delegation of thirty-four with
possibly two exceptions. They c unt
upon electing 100 out of the 150 members
of tiiÂ« State Legislature, thus insuring the
election of a Republican to succeed David
B. Hill in the United Slates Senate.
Chairman Danforth of the Democratic
State Committee says he is confident of
carrying the Btate for Bryan by 40,000.
lie looks for a Democratic plurality in this
city of 30,000. The betting, however; is
the other way. The registration is con
siderably in excess of all former years and
the heaviest vote on record will probably
be polled.

CHICAGO, 111, Nov. I.â Bryan and
McKinley forces met in West Madison
street last night. Four men were injured
and three arrested, two of the latter being
liberated when it appeared to the police
that they were neither instigators of the
riot nor active participants. The trouble
necessitated the calling of extra Â«-qu ids of
officers until a whole company was de
tailed within the two block-* bounded by
De-piaines and Halstead streets.
The injured are: Hugh Murray, Richard
Porter, E. J. Proctor and Robert Converse.
The trouble began at 6:30 o'clock. The
headquarters of the Eighteenth Ward
Silver Democrats and Republicans are
nearly opposite each other, ana the crowds
which hang about both places came
together three times before midnight.
CHICAGO. 111., Nov. I.â The police
were called upon to-night to quell a polit
ical riot on the West Side. Fifteen or
twenty people were battered and bruised.
The right took place in front of a Repub
lican meeting place at the cornerof Union
and Madison streets. From a near-by
Bryan hall came a crowd of silver men,
who were marching.
When they arrived in front of the
McKinley nail, it is alleged, they stopped
and commenced shouting for Bryan,
thereby interrupting the speakers inside
who were arguing for a gold standard.
There was a general exit from the hail
and the two crowds came together, and
the fight became so mixed that it is said
the combatants couid not tell their friends
from tueir enemies, but were striking at
random. A riot call was sent in to the
nearest police station, and twenty-five
policemen were sent to the scene. The
police soon restored order. No one was
seriously injured.

WILMINGTON. Del., Nov. I.â Hugh
C. Browne, chairman of the Republican
State Committee, has telegraphed the
Uni;ed Associated Presses as follows:
"The reports that Delaware is doubtful
forMcKinley are without foundation. Itis
untrue that because Mr. Addicks laid
down the Republican vote was not qual
ified. It was never better qualified by
payment of poll taxes and fuil registration
than this year. Mr. Addick-' organization
did not qualify the vote. That was done
by the regular Republicans, who are in
excellent shape. The assertion that the
financial conaition of Mr. Addicks had
anything to rto with qualifying the vote is
not true. We undertook and completed
tbe work. Delaware will surely give Mc-
Kinley 1500 majority, barrinc treachery."

PARIS, France, Nov. I.â The Seine has
been rising foi some days and has now
reached a point that is causing much
alarm. Low-lying structures along its
bangs have been flooded and much dam
age has been done above and below. The
river is so full of floating debris that traf
fic upon it has been stopped. Most of the
other rivers of France are also out of their
banks.
Many of tbe villages along the Rhone
are completely surrounded by water. At
Vallabreques, near Taraxcon, the inhab
itants have been driven from their homes
by the risirg waters and are camping in
the cemetery, which is situated on high
ground.
Near Nmes, department of Gard, and
Bourg, in the aepartment of Am, a num
ber of bridges have been swept away.
Families living on the low ground near
the Rhone have taken refuge in the upper
stories of their bouses, the lower portions
being inundated. The district northeast
of Nimes has suffered extensively.
Tbe Bishop of Nimes is rendering what
assistance be can to the distressed vil
lagers. The inundations are so extensive
that the postmen have to use boats to per
form their labors.
The plain of Roquemaure is an immense
lake. The water is so deep that only the
tops of the trees are visible. The ronds
northwest of Bourge are impassable. The
inhabitants are terrified, as the flood gives
promise of increasing. The islets of Piot
and Barthelaise in the Rhone, near Avig
non.capital of the department of Vaucluse,
are completely submerged. The inunda
tion is causing much distress, and the
property loss will be heavy.

LONDON, Eno., Nov. I.â Tbe Daily
News will to-morrow publish a dispatch
from Rome saying that Cardinal Satolli
made a lengthy report to the Pope regard"
ing the situation in the United States,
especially the political situation. Al
though the Cardinal considers that Mr.
McKinley's success is certain, he appre
hends the consequences, which, if they
are not immediately grave, will, in his
opinion, certainly be so at tbe next elec
tion, when the present differences will be
augmented.

Cardinal Gibbons Speaks of the Battle of
Ballots and Not Bullets and the

BALTIMORE, Md., Nov. I.â Cardinal
Gibbons touched upon the political situa
tion in his sermon at the Cathedral this
morning. He said:
"We are on the eve of a Presidential
election, both great parties contending for
tiie mastery. They are leaving no stone
unturned in order to be successful.
"A foreigner looking on and witnessing
the violent denunciat \n that one party is
uttering against another, and the terrible
pn dictions in regard to the future of the
country if the other party were to win,
would think that we are on the verge of
dreadful revolution.
"On next Wednesday morning he would
find that it was but a bloodless revolution,
one effected not by bullets, but by ballots.
A man is to be chosen to the highest posi
tion in the gift of his fellows, and impor
tant issues are at stake. Yet on next
Wednesday the minority will bow crace
fully to the will of the majority, the coun
try will survive and the Nation will
flourish and be perpetuated."

GUTHRIE. O. T., Nov. I.â United
States Deputy Marshal Thomas and posse
came in from tne Creek country yester
day, having been in search of "Dynamitp
Dick" and his gang of outlaws, who looted
Carney and the Sac and Fox agency.
They brought with them a team of mules
loaded with plunder and a saddle-horse,
which they captured.
They came upon three of the outlaws as
they were leading their horses up a ravine
and a pitched battle ensued. It was get
ting dsrtc, and though over 100 shots were
fired, nobody was hurt and the outlaws
escaped in the darkness, abandoning
mules, baggage and one horse. There is
no doubt about their being the Carney

[Copyright, 1896. br the United Associated Presses]
BERLIN, Germany, Nov. I.â lf the tri
umph of McKinley at the polls in the
Presidential election which takes place in
the United States next Tuesday is not an
overwhelming one, political and com
mercial Germany will experience a shock
of surprise. With the exception of some
of the special cable dispatches sent by its
American correspondent to the Berliner
Taytblatt, all ol the advices which have
been sent by wire or mail to the Berlin
press have so expressly excluded any pos
sibility of Bryan's election that interest
in the American campaign has waned.
The Socialist organ, ttie Vorwarts, and
the Freisinnige and .other Liberal organs
suggest that an uprising of the masses
might defeat the combined educated and
capitalistic forces, but in the face of the
unvarying tenor of the news received
from America the public has accepted
the election of McKinley as a foregone
conclusion.
Class prejudice here, however, is little
interested in the result, as evidenced by
the utterances of the Kreuz Zeitung, Con
servative, which discusses the question
ot McKinley vs. Bryau from a currency
point of view, ignoring all of the issues
entering into the campaign. Tbe Keuz
Zeitung inclines, however, to the support
â¢of McKinley, as the election of a bimetal
list such as Bryan would bu disastrous.
The influence of the trusts and other mo
nopolies, in diverting electoral votes
from Bryan, is also commented upou by
many newspapers, but the consensus of
opinion is that nothing can prevent a
McKinley triumph. Under this convic
tion the Boerse for the past two days
has been especially firm for American
stocks and textile manufactures, and the
expectation is that after the election there
will be an increase of exports to the
United States, this belief being based upon
the ground that the advance in the price
of grain is benehting to American farmers
and consequently ought to lead to an in
crease in the demand for European goods.
German farmers, however, have not in
the least benefited by the rise in the price
of wheat and other cereals, as have the
agriculturists of Hungary, where the bar
vest has been abundant and where there
las been an advance of nearly 2 florins
Tier hundredweight in the price of wheat.
This state of things has been a perfect god
send to lie Hungarian farmers and has
also given an impetus to trade all around.
The Berlin financial journals in their
articles discussing the prospects for the
immediate future agree that if McKinley
is elected, affairs will remain very much
as they are at present, that is to say that
there will be little or no financial trade;
but if Bryan should be successful, there
will be a financial and commercial cata
ciysm. European capitalists, tho-e papers
agree, must therefore prepare for a decline
in American securities, a large premium,
on *:old, extensive failures of American
firms having gold contracts in Europe and
the consequent failure of European and es
pec ally Eug i-<h capitalists and stoppage
of European exports for America.
The conference which Chancellor Prince
Hohenlohe had with the Emperor yester
day is understood to have bad reference to
a projected conference of the European
powers with the object of revising the
treaties of Berlin and Paris, and also a
settlement of the customs dispute which
has for Some time existed between Russia
and Germany. The Emperor is favorable
to making concessions to Russia, which
will bring about the speediest possible
settlement of the confiding interpreta
tions ot the present commercial treaty,
and it is understood that the Czar is not
averse to yielding many of the points at
issue, if an amicable and favorable adjust
ment of the differences is tbus brought
about. The Russian official, M. Timir
jagseff, who conducted the original treaty
negotiations, will arrive in Berlin on Tues
day for the purpose of assisting in the ar
rangement necessary for the hoi ing of a
conference, but nothing in regard to tnÂ«
matters in question is definitely known,
except that it is given out that t ere may
be some delay in the settlement inasmuch
as it is announced that the Czar has in
timated his desire for a period of absolute
home repose before allowing bis Ministers
to enter into any engagements involving
the empire.
Although the Czar had something like a
season of rest during his visit to tbe
Queen at Balmoral and also during his
stay at Darmstadt, persons connected
with the entourage of the Czar and Czarina
say that his Majesty intends to enjoy a
period of the solitude of home life as tha
only means of securing perfect repose.

that he will cease all slate business as long
as possible. But â¢ - question is, will
events await the <z leisure?
Prince Hohenloli.-' .iiterview witu tne
Emperor is believtd also to have had some
reference to the death a few days ago of
his brother, Cardinal Gustav Adolf
Hohenlohe, the most liberal member of
the Sacred College, and it may be re
marked the second brother of the Cban
celoi who has died within the year, the
other also having been a Cardinal.
The Chancellor was opposed to the pro
mulgation of the dogmas of the immacu
late conception and the infalliDiUty of
the Pope by Pore Pius IX. and held his
brother, Cardinal Gustav Adolf in con
tempt as being lightheaded and shallow
minded. Pope Leo XIII distrusted Cardi
nal Hohenlohe as a dangerous intriguer,
knowing him to be a personal friend of
Prince Bismarck. During the Kultur
kamrf, at the crisis of the quarrel with
Popo Leo XIII, Cardinal Hoheniohe
left Rome and sought a refuge in
Munich with Dr. Doellinger, the
leader of the old Catholics at that
time, and menaced tt:e Vatican with
a schism in the ranks of the German
Catholics. The masterful tact of the Pope
was the only thing which prevented a
scandal and tne death of ihe Cardinal re

Benin yesterday, and had an interview
with Chancellor Hoheuiohe, after the
latter's conference with the Kaiser. It i 3
impossible to learn the result of Count
Bismarck's interview wiih ihe Chancellor,
cxcÂ» pt that he di-cialnis all responsibiliiy
for the recent articles in the Hamburger
Nachrichten, his father's personal orpan,
revealing the fact that from I^B4 to 1890
Germany maintained an understanding
with Russia contrary to the terms of the
Dreibuna treaty. If the Government does
not take measures to ascertain the exact
origin of the disclosures aud rind the re
sponsibility therefore before the Reichstag
meets ou November 8, it is the intention
of the Radical and Socialist leaders in the
Chamber to demand that explanations of
the Kuspo- German agreement be the first
mauets to come up for debate.
Just before the Czar started from Darm
stadt for St. Petersburg bis Majesty wired
to the admiral of the Russian fleet at
Odessa insisting upon the latter\ tnking*
especial precautions to guard the Euro

copy of his telegram to the Russian em
bassy at Constantinople, with directions
that the full text o. his dispatch to the ad

Considerable betting on the result of the
American Presidential election was done
on the Berlin Bourse toward the close of
yesterday's session, the odds in favor of
JlcKinley's success running up to 4 to 1.
The Frankfort and Vienna Bourses were
firm yester-iay under the influence of the
favorable McKinley forecasts, but busi
ness was greatly restricted, especially
toward the close, and speculators operated
with a great deal of hesit ncy.

IRISH WLL CAMP
ON BRYAN'S TRAIL
Endeavoring to Undo What
Little the Nebraskan
Accomplished.
The California Colonel Is thr
Equal of tne Bay Orator
in Debate.
THAT LONG CHASE FOR VOTEf
No Less Than Seventeen Thousan
Miles Already Traveled by the
Free-Si ver Candidate.
LINCOLN, Nebb., Nov. I.â When Mr.
Bryan leaves Lincoln to-morrow morning
for his flying campaign trip through his
own State he will be followed at no great
distance by John P. Irish of California,
who will strive to undo whatever Mr.
Bryan accomplishes. This programme
was decided upon by the National Demo
crats of Nebraska when Chairman Mark
11. wma. vetoed t!ie proposition that ex-
Congressraan William E. Mason should
perform that duty for the Republicans.
Mr. Irish is known in the State as an
ag ressive and Bkilled debater on the
money question, and when he and Mr.
Bryan met last spring in joint discussion
at the Crete Ciiuutauqua the audience
united in declaring it a drawn battle, and
the declaration was made that it would
not be their last appearance. It is im
probable that Mr. Irish will follow Mr.
Bryan throughout the day, but arrange
ments for his receptions have been made
in most oi the larger towns to be visited.
While party feeling is at a high pitch no
trouble is expected as the result of the
Irish programme. The stops generally
will be short, and reports from the towns
to be visited indicate no feeling of resent
ment toward the gold-standard advocates
unless it be at Hastings, where Mr. Bry
an's followers are inclined to be bitter.
Preparations on an elaborate scale have
been made for the reception of both men,
bu: lany direct insult will hardly be offered
either unless there be greater cause for it
than is now evident.
A long sleep this afternoon and a longer
one to-day was William J. Bryan's way of
preparing for his flying trip through Ne
braska to-morrow. The unprecedented
campaign tour of the Democratic candi
date practically ended this morning when
he stepped from his private car Idler,
furn :-hed by the Democratic National
Committee, in the Burlington station
here. He and Mrs. Bryan spent last nicht
in Council Bluffs and rode over to Omaha
this morning in an electric car to take the
8:30 train for Lincoln, to which the Idler
had been attached. About 200 people
were waiting for Mr. Bryan here. They
gave him a suppressed Sunday morning
cheer and many shook hands with him as
he walked smilingly to the carriage in
waiting. There was a joyous scene, of
course, at the Bryan residence when the
three children of the candidate welcomed
their father and mother.
Mr. Bryan was tired and went to bed
soon after reaching home. He slept until
supper time and retired again eariy to
night to secure a good rest for to-morrow's
journey.
His own State of Nebraska was selected
by Mr. Bryan for the final rally of the
free silver forces. The confidence he has
felt that he would carry the State was bis
rsason for not making a tour within its
boundaries earlier in the campaign. It
was the same with regard to Kansas; but
that State and his own are the only two
previously in the Republican column,
with the exception of those west of here
where the free-silver sentiment is consid
ered tbe strongest, that he has neglected
in tU3 fight for Democratic victory.
The long and hard working campaign
<hat Mr. Bryan has pursued began wiih
his departure from Chicago on July 13,
the Monday following his nomination.
From that time to ibis he has been on the
go, barring three weeks spent in Lincoln
prior to his departure for New York City
to be formally notified of nis selection as
the Democratic btandard-bearer and a
week in the quiet surroundings of Upper
Red Hook. His hardest day of the cam
paign was that during which he made ttie
journey from Chicago to Ptttsburg, en
route to the notification meeting.
He left Chicago half an hour before mid
night and made speeches almost continu
ously from that time until he conclude
his last address to a Pittsburg audi-nee
twenty-four hours later. That record
breaking trip was made during the ter
rible :iÂ«ated spell of last summer and lelt
the candidate pretty well exhausted. The
second hardest day included Southern
Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky. Starting
from Si. Louis early in the morning, he
talked Kb many gatherings along 'his
route and was obliged to deliver four more
speeches on his arrival at Louisville at
night. Twenty-seven was the number of
speeches made on his journey from Chi
cago to Pittaburg and be came within one
of equaling that remarkable record one
day in Michigan last month. He went as
far north as JJuluth, Minn., and as far
south as Memphis, Term., while the At
lantic Coast was covered from North
Carolina to Maine.
How many miles Mr. Bryan will have
traveled when be returns to Lincoln again
Tuesday morning, after his Nebraska
roundup, has not been accurately com
puted, but some of those who accompanied
him intend to delve out the correct figure
by a careful study of toe railroad maps
and tables of distance. Seventeen thou
sand miles is aji approximate estimate.
The Democratic candidaie visited twenty
seven States, namely : Connecticut, Dela
ware, Illinois, Indiana, lowa, Kansas
(passing through in the night from Lin
coln to Kansas City), Kentucky, Ma<ne,
Maryland. Massachusetts Micnigan. Min
nesota, Missouri, Nebraska, N--w Hump
shire. New Jersey, Korth Carolina, North
Dnkota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode
Island. South Dakota, Tennessee, Vir
ginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin. He
also made a speech m the District of Co
lumbia.
James T. Dahlman of Omaha, chairman
of the Democratic State Central Commit
tee, will have charge o. the Nebraska cam
paign to-morrow. James O'Shea of the
State Committee and a number of cam
paign orators, including several former
Republicans, will accompany Mr. Bryan
to make speeches along the route. One or
more remain at prominent p. aces to fol
low up the arguments advanced by the
National candidate. The trip will take
Mr. Bryan into four of the MX Congres
sional districts in the Slate. Speeches are
scifdnled for sixteen places, but it is
probable more stons will be made. Mr.
Bryan will leave Lincoln on the Idler by
a special train, at 6:45 o'clock, and is due
in Omaha n Bin the evening. Mrs. Bryan
will accompany ber husband. The entire
journey will be made over the Burlington
road.
Mr. Bryan to-night sent the following
dispatch to Senator Jones:

WARING TO THIS POPULISTS.
Chairman Wathburn Tells Constituents
to Watch and Pratfx
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. I.â The following
warning addressed to "The voters of the
United States," was issued to-day by
George F. vVashburn, chairman of the
Chicago branch of the People's party
National Executive Committee:
The startling statements of Republican
leaders, such as Lauterbach of New York, that
"they may not Ã¼biue by the results," and of
ex-Senator Henderson, threatening armed re
sistance if Bryan wins, and oi Theodore Roose
velt that he may lead a regiment to war if
Bryan wins and the open boasts of the Repub
lican lead, rs that if the election is close it
will be contested, backed by Urover Cleveland
and the Federal Government in their effort to
repeat what was accomplished when Tilden
was elected, together with the well-known
fact that the Republican corruption fund of
millions of dollars is to be used on election
Uay in purchasing election boards fal
sifying retu-ns and buying up voters
in a 'wholesale manner, and that
coercion will be resorted to by merchants,
manufarturers and other employers who will
i timidate their employes to vote for Mc-
Kiuley reader it necessary that we put the
people on guard. In consideration of these
un-American, unpatriotic and revoludonary
tiictics and attempts of scheming men to de
bauch and steal the Nation we feel justified in
i-Biiing this warning to the American people.
First â Pay no attention whatever to sensa
tional reports whether they affect the candi
date, public speakers oi others. Whatever the
character, brand them as lies, vote early, mark
one ticket only, work hard and bring out your
iriends. Avoid controversies at the polls and
see that watchers are at every voting place
watching for iraud. Watch the Dallot
boxes until the votes are nil counted and the
tally-sheets %nitde up and signed. Remember
that it is in the midnight hours that the frauds
are perpetrated.
Secondâ The New York Journal offers $1000
reward and the Na ional Democratic Commit
tee $500 to any person lurnishing evidence
necessary for the conviction of any one at
tempting to bribe, coerce or intimidate any
voter in any State. The ballot is secret, and
under no possible circumstances can it be
known how you vote. Insist on your rights
and you will be protected in them. "Eternal
vigilance is the price of liberty." Be wteady,
alert and true to Bryan and silver arid victory
will be yours to enjoy, and, by the Eternal, no
power on earth sha>l take ii from you. Watch
and pray on election day and if victory
crowns our efforts assemble in every village,
town and city to proclaim the good news and
celebrate the advent of a new era.
George F. Washburn,
Chairman Chicago Branch People's Party
National Executive Committee.
Forecasting the result of the election in
its bearing on the probable strength of the
Peoi.le's i.arty in both Houses of Con
gress, Chairman Wasbbaru said to a re
porter for tue United Associated Presses:
One of the interesting results of the election
will be the number of Congressmsn which the
Populiits wilt have in the next House and
Senate. In order to secure fus on in the dif
ferent States on the electoral tickets and com
pletely harmonize the silver forces, fusion was
not only arranged upon Cousre-smeti.but also
upon many tickets, and as a retail of this
work, if Bryan is elected, the Populists will
hare between sixty and seven tv electors, be
tween twenty and thirtv Congressmen, several
United States Senators. Governors and other
members of the Stale tickets in s ver.-i! States,
as well aÂ« members of the Legislature and
county officials by the hundreds.
This will more thoroughly entrench and es
tablish our party thin all that has been ac
complished during the Inn three years. We
now have the balance of power in theSena'e,
and should tne Democrats secure the next
House it is to be expected that there will be a
great detection of' Democratic Congressmen
who will unite with the Republicans in fli.ht
ing silver. Should this occur, the faithful
Hllies will be the Populists, who may hold the
balance of power in the lower House, just as
we do in the Senate. With Mr. Bryan as Presi
dent he will be greatly embarrassed in the
next session of Congress by the gold Demo
crats in their effort to obstruct silver legisla
tion. We shall therefore need to begin at once
to prepare for the fight two years hence, in
order that he may be supported by a Congress
in fuii sympathy with hiÂ« views.
BUTLER BLOWS HIS WORN.
I'ollotrt Ji-tnoeratie Shouters in Claim-
ing bticces* for Itryan.
WASHINGTON, D. ft, Nov. l._ The
flurry in the fusion camp in North Caro
lina, arising from causes which are as
carefully guarded from publicity as Mr.
Watson's letter of acceptance, and which
so disturbed Democratic and Populist
headquarters 'I'bursday evening in the ab
sence oJ Senator Butltr, chairman of the
National Populist Committee, was not
considered by Mr. Butler, on nis return to
this city, of sufficient importance to war
rant a trip to Raleigh to compose it.
"I have investigated the matter," he
*aid, "and sent a telegram to Raleigh in
respect thereto.
â¢'No, I do not care to state what the re
port was, but it should not have caused
the commotion it did."
Supporting his claim that Bryan will be
elected by a handsome majority, Senator
Butler asserted that the Bilver Republican
vote wonld largely exceed that of the
Gold Democrats, and that a larger per
cent of the labor vote would be cast for
Bryan than for any previous Democratic
candidate. The 2,000,000 Populist votes,
he contended, would be thrown solidly
for Bryan, and these being the balance of
power in every one of the so-called doubt
ful StateÃ, would give Bryan not only a
good majority In the Electoral College,
but a big majority of the popular vote.
NO MODESTY IN THEIRS.
HebraMlea Democrat* Mot Sloxc in Claim-
ing Bryan's Election
OMAHA. Nebb., Nov. I.â James C.
Dahlman, chairman of the Democratic
State Central Committee, made bia final
statement of the result of the election in
this State. It is as follows:
The result of the campaign in Nebraska is
not in doubt, Mr. Bryan will have a plurality
of not less than 17.000. and we would not be
surprised should it reach 30,000. The free
silver canvass of Nebraska has been complete
end ovary hamlet in the State has a Bryan
club numbering among its members a large
percentage off Republicans. The Republican
voters of Nebraska supporting Mr. Bryan can
very reasonably be estimated at 10,000. The
Populist vote ot the Siate will be cast so idly
for the free silver ti.ket, and it numbers
about 70.000. The Democratic votÂ» can
Bcarcs'iy b* estimated at less than 30,000
This would give Bryan 110,000 votes.
The Republican vote In Nerxaska, less the
free-silver strength of that party, conld not
exceed 80.000. li Mr. McKiaiey gets 5000
gold Democratic votes he will still lack 25,000
of carrying the State. Mr. Bryan will get
some of the prohibition vote of the state.
In making this estimate we concede to the
Republicans all tie strengih which comes
from a free use of money and the colonization
cf voters. Oar organization Is complete in
every precinct. The friends of Mr. Brvaii are
enthusiastic and confident of the result, and
Nebraska will roll up a handsome majority for
her distinguished son. We will not only elect
Governor Holccmb but the entire fusion State
ticket. We feel confident of at ieait four of the
six Congressmen, and would not be surprised
anouid we get the entire Congressional dele
gation. J. c. Dahlman.

LABOR STANDS
FOR PROTECTION
Cry of the Calamity-Howl
ers Falls on Barren
Ground.
All This Talk of Coercion Proves
to Be Simply a Campaign
Dodge.
The cry of "coercion" as raised by the
calamity-howlers has no foundation in
fact, as a canvass of the various larx>r or
ganizations yesterday clearly demon
strated. It was generally admitted to be
the despairine cry of the silver-mine own
ers' press, which for month* past has
waged a warfare based on repudiation and
unsound doctrim-s.
The wa^e-earners of San Francisco, with
a few necessary exception*, have volun
tarily supported the principles advocated
by McX nley and will to-morrow give a
substantial blow to the hue and cry of
"coercion" which has been raised by the
Bryan iies. They wanted to wash off the
stigma of defeat in the waters of fraud,
but the thing would not go down with the
working people. They stand for sound
money and protection and no amount of
Bide talK, least of all coercion, will keep
their ballots from expressing their convic
tions on election day.
The strongest possible evidence of this
is found in the action of the California
Labor Convention yesterday. The mem
bers thought so little of the siory that
they refused to seriously consider it. W.
Macarthur of the Coast Seaman's Journal
and well known in labor circles was in
clined to laugb at the whole matter. He
had beard such tilings, but when it came
to a question of oroof he said it was not
forthcoming. For this very reason he de
clined to believe that such conditions ex
isted except in the minds of the ret>u
diators. The secretary of the Labor Asso
ciation entertained the same views.
Allen Park, a paperhanger by profes
sion and popular in labor circles, declared
that he knew of no case where labor had
been requested to cast its vote with the
proprietors. He did not believe mat such
a thing could exist nowadays.
Tneodore Lynch, secretary of the Lib
erty Branch and member of the State ex
ecutive committee, Socialist Labor party,
said :
"1 am not aware of any influence being
brought to bear on any of the wage
earners of my acquaintance to vote tluir
employers' wishes next Tuesday and on y
heard of such influence incidentally,
when mv attention was drawn to it by
the remarks of Governor Budd, published
in the Examiner. That such a thing is
not altogether impossible, however, I am
not prepared to say, considering that most
men are influenced to-day in voting by
their necessities, wnereas under Socialism
all men would be free to vote their con
victions, as under a co-operative com
monwealth all citizens would enjoy in
dustrial as well as political equality.''
Out of twenty-one streetcar conductors
and motormen seen not one even hinted
at other than a free and unrestrained
vote. No request had been made to vote
for McKinley or Bryan and so far as they
knew the other employes had not been
approached. The snme is true of the men
working at the Union Iron Works asd
othtr iarge establishments. They would
vote as they had marched Saturday, for
McKinley and protection, and that, too,
wit out any hint from the "bosses." The
sentiments of R. Enslish, foreman of the
City Improvement Com pan v, practically
expresses the feelings and ideas of those
interviewed. He said:
"All this taik of coercion is mere fol-de
*ol â a claptrap son oi scheme to distract
public attention from the real issue's. But
the working people cannot be fooled by
such thunder. They appreciate protection
and they understand the meaning of sound
money. They do not have to De 'coerced'
into voting their convictions.
"The Improvement Company employs
100 men, and so far as I know not oue of
them has been even requested to cast his
vote for either McKinley or Bryan. I
honestly think all this talk is a scheme to
apologize for ihe poor showing the Bilver
men win make at tne polls. What the
workingman wants is sound money and a
chance to earn it."
A Burglar Charged.
Thomas Con well, a laborer 18 years cf age,
had two charges of burglary booked against
him yesterday. He is accused of having
broken into tho California warebonse, Second

NEVADA CITY, Cal., Not. 1 The
Republicans held the last meeting of
their campaign in this city last night,
when they were addressed by Major C.
â¢ M. Kyle of San Francisco, Hon. Thomas
S. Selvage of Eureka and the local candi
dates lor office. The theater was crowded
to the doors and many ladies graced the
MAJOR CHARLES W. KYLE, Who Closed the Nevada County
Republican Campaign at Nevada Gty.
"meeting with their presence. The stage ]
was 'iecorated with flowers and bunting, i
thefootlinhts being banked with gold and
â  silver chrysanthemums. W. F. Engle
. britht presided, and after a selection by
the band and a campaign song by a
male quartet, he introduced L. S. Calkins,
nominee tor State Senator; \V. S. Robin
son, nominee for Assemblyman, and
Frank T. Nilon, r/ominee for Superior
Jiidge, who spoke in turn and laid their
claims for preferment before the people.
Major Kyle, being introduced, made a
. splendid speech, saying in part:
What may be done to insure a return of pros-
Deri ty to this country? This is the question
whicu we are all called upon to answer on
next Tuesday. Tl.e Republican party says
thst the oniy reasonable un.l fcasiole way by
which we may hope to insure the prosperity of
this couutry is by providing employment for
its labor â steady, remunerative employment,
which a stable and never wavering currency
guarantees to the employedâ a dollar of the
highest possible purchasing power.
Between ihe years of 1880 and 1890 this
Country increased its wea th far more rapidly
Ihan any other nation under the sun has done
st any like period in the nistory of the world.
Mr. Mulhaii, the celebrated English statis
tician, says that the New England States in
creased th,eir wealth during the ten years
'mentioned from three billions to five billions
Â°of dollar* â a ratio of 60 per cent increase in
ten years! The Middle States increased their
- wealth from nine billions to seventeen billions
of dollarsâ a ratio of 88 per cent. The South
ern States increased their wealth from two bil
lions to nine billions ol dollarsâ a ratio of 350
per cent; while the Pacific Coast Statesâin
cluding the brightest star of them all â in
crewsed their wealth from six hundred and
fifty-six millions 10 slxbiliinns of dollarâ at
the striking nnd unparalleled ratio of 1000
per cent in ten years !
T^e world poiuts to this marvelous record in
amazement, for no page of history reveals
anything like unto It. We had, during the
, period mentioned, neither free silver nor free
trade. On the other hand we did have the
enforcement of thi' great law of protection to
American industries and we were then, as
now, on a sound-money basis.
How may we reasonably hope to induce a
return of a like era of prosperity except by ihe
adoption of the same la> s and policy which
then governed this country?
Major Kyle was followe 1 by Mr. Sel
vage, whose speech was well received.
YOLO CHAMPOION ENDED.
Winters the Scene of the Concluding He- !
publican Demonstration.
" WINTERS, Cal,, Nov. I.â The cam-
D.iign in Yoio County was closed lastnik'ht
by a very successful and enthusiastic Re
publican meeting in the opera-house. !
Notwithstanding many Republicans had \
gone to San Francisco to see the great i
parade, and that the Democratic demon
.â¢-tration at Dixou drew quite a delegation
from Winters, over 600 people were pres
ent to attest their interest in the import
ant issues to be cresenied for the last
time before the great battle.
E. E. Goddis, nominee for Superior
Judge, and Arthur W. Worth, candidate
for the Assembly, each male short
speeches, and Hon. J. O. Hayes of San
Jose delivered the aiidress of the evening.
Hayes confined himself almost exclu
sively to the financial question and made !
â the most intelligent presentation ol that
issue yet eiven to the voters of Yolo
county. He was beard with close atten
tion, and the many eood points made
were cheered to the ecLo.
He not only reiuted the rash assertions
of Democratic orators, but gave such
a lucid explanation of the sophistries of
- the fret-coma. c apostles that to-day many
of them are wondering "where they are
at."
R. R. Duckworth of San Francisco fol
lowed with a thirty-minute speech, clos
ing with an address in the Spanish
language to a few voters present who
spoke only that language. A feature of
.the evening was a speech by C. P. Sum
i mers, a Yoio farmer, who is a gold Demo-
I wat. He made a terrific assault on the
1 "Bryan cang."

Advantage* That Would- Ilesult.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Nov. I.â E. J. Louis
of the executive committee of tne local
McKinley Club to-nigm received an auto
grapti letter from William McKinley, in
which he says:
That the citizens of California should take a
profound interest in the success of the Repub
lican cause, is not at all strange. >o suction
of our country has more reasons to maintain
a great doctrine of protection than Caliiorma.
Your great Sta :e ims demonstrated its capa
city to raise wuits tully equal to those im
porte.i trom Southern Europe and from the
Southern and Central American republics,
and with adequate protection there is no
doubt that the fruit industry would be de
veiopeu and would be profitable to a degree
that would be of enormous advantage to the
people of California.

ROMANCE OF PORTLAND
Chicago Drummer Is Married
Without His Knowledge or
Consent
Sues for Divorce on the Ground That
He Was Entrapped While
Intoxicated
PORTLAND, Or.. Nov. I.â Walt H.
Butcher, a well known Chicago traveler,
i having a semi-annual run to the Pacific
! slope, is a plaintiff in a divorce suit filed
â¢ yesterday after being married without his
I knowledge iess than a week.
Last Sunday night he and a fellow
drummer "took in the town," visiting a
number of places of gayety and from all
accounts the Chicago man aid not "come
to" until Thursday morning last. He
! awakened in a Third-street house, the
I while trying to collect his scattered
thought-, when a woman entered. He
recollected having met heron his rounds,
she being known to him as Lizzie Estes.
! Butcher ordered the woman to leave him.
j This she declined to do, claiming she was
his wife. She handed to Butcher a docu
ment, neatly tied with a red silk ribbon.
Butcher opened it and at first glance his
face indicated that he was about to faint.
It was a marriage certificate showing that
Walt H. Butcher and Miss Lizzie Estee
were married in Oregon City on Wednes
day, October 26, 1896:
Butcher realized the terrible situation in
which lie had been placed. It was simply j
a blackmailing scheme. Sue had taken
j him to Oregon City while in his cups and
there caused him to marry her, expecting
that when be became sober and under
stood what he had done he would be only
too glad to pay a sum of money to be
freed. He made all sorts of threats to the
woman, but they were of no avail.
Butcher is worth considerable money
and the woman is going to defend the suit
with all the assistance at her command.
She alleges that Butcher had been drink
ing somewhat, but he was perfectly con
scious of what he was about when he pro
posed marriage to her.

LORDSBURG, N. Mbx.,Nov. I.â Deputy
Sheriff Frank M. Galloway met deatn at
the hands of a party of fellow-officers last

Sheriff Shannon and three deputies took
the trail on Wednesday after Black Jack

Separ Tuesday night, and followed them
to San Simon Valley. Last night they
camped near Skull Mountain. They be

Galloway, while on watch at 3 o'clock,
walked some fifteen or twenty yards away
from ihe camp. He made a noise which
awakened the others. They could see his
form, but did not recognize him.
Franc McGiinchy called out "Who is
there" twice, but received no answer.
Supposing they were about to be at
tacked Sheriff Shannon gave the order to
fire. Deputy McGiinchy and Birchfield
both fired. Galloway was hit in the face,
the bullet going through nishead, causing
instant death.
There was consternation in the party
when it was learned that an awful mistake
had been made.
Galloway was popular with his fellows,
who respected him because of his fearless
ness. Sheriff Shannon at once abandoned
the pursuit of the bandits and brought
the body to Lordsburg, and to-nipht it
was shipped to Galloway's home in Silver
City.
Frank M. Galloway was born and raised
in Philadelphia, where he learned the
printer's trade. He came to New Mexico
about eight years ago and engaged in
mining. He went with Shannon's posse as
p. special deputy. He leaves a widow and
lour young children.
WINDFALL FOR AN ACTOR.

TACOMA, Wash., Nov.l.â H.O. Stubbs,
a member of the A. Y. Pearson's stock
company from San Francisco, now play
ing an engagement at the Ninth Street
Theater, received word by cablegram
while the company was in Anaconda,
Montana, recently, that he had fallen
heir to a portion of his grandfather's
estate. Yesterday Mr. Stubbs, who is but
22 years of age, received documents from
England assurin. tdim that the cablegram
was all rig t, and that he would soon re
ceive $216,000, his share of the estate.
When Mr. Stubbs' grandfather died he
left an esiate valued at over $J. 000,000 to
:s eldest son, the father oi young Stubbs.
Before entering into his estate the bene
ficiary died, leaving a widow and ten
children. The other sons of the deceased
grandfather contested the will, and after
a fight of seventeen years the case has
been decided in favor of the original heirs.
Mr. Stubbs has been doing light comedy
parts for five years and has also been en
gated in reportorial work on the Chicago
papers. He will engage lawyers at once
to look out for his interests, and on pay
ment of the first installment of the great
lep-acy he proposes to visit England with
his mother and sisters, who reside in
Chicago. He will later enter an Eastern
college and will educate his sisters.

THE GOVERNOR ROASTED.
A Sharp Letter From His Old-Time
Friend, Geortre B. Sperry.
George B. Sperry has severed his official
relations with Governor James H. Budd,
and lrankiy stated reasons in the foilow
ing letter:
Stockton, Oct. 31, 1896.
Jame* B. Budd, Governor oj Caijornia.â MY
I'k-.r -!R: Yon were the nominee of the De
mocracy in 1882 for Congress. I supported
you. In 1H94 1 was, as you know, ami as is
generally known, one of your supporters for
the h:ghest office i" the gift of the people of
California. On both occasions I departed from
the path trodden by my own peopie^l herewith
tender them my apology), butl was not ihe
only Republican who thus erred, as is evi
denced by the majority you received for both
offices. I do not propose to discuss here my
reasons for my action, or to make any apolo
gies to the Re; Ã¼blican party at large.
1 have held for the past two years a position
on your per.*,onal staff. You also "inherited"
me from Governor H. H.Markhamasa Yosemite
Commissioner. I forwarded to you to-day my
resignation for both of these offl.-es. My
reasons therefor are as follows: I do not
wish to be connected in an official capacity
with you alter your speech delivered in San
Francisco Monday evening last, when you de
liberately charged employers with bribing
and coercion and employes with corruption
and cowbrdice (for an employe must necegaa
rily be cowardly who would be coerced).
You musi remember, sir, that these are the
people who supported you in 1894 ana made
it possible for you to become Governor of Cal
ilornia. Have you so little regard for the in
telligence of American labor as to believe that
in the short period of two yeHrs they have
become eligible to the "jackass parade," to
quote your own words?
The directorate of the flour company of
which 1 have the honor to be a member is
made up of men who are a) must equally di
vided on the issaes of the d*y, and 1 cha.lenjre
you or any one to truthlully assert that they
or the managers of the different mills have by
word or act influenced or tried to influence
their employes for or against any poli'ical
nominees or measures. Some of our employes
will turn out in the Republican parade in ban
Francisco this day, and aver my friend-hip
and acquaintanceship with you, running back
for thirty-eight years , 1 take it as an insult to
me personally to charge Republican employ
ers with coercion.
I consider your remarks on the date afore
-6ai<l intern Derate, demiigoKic and false and un
becoming the dignity and honor which your
hich office imposes upon you. 1 believe "that
the peope will repudiate your insults at tne
polls on Tuesday next. If not then they will
certainiydo so if you at any time in the luture
be unfortunate enough to be the nominee of
any political party.
Thanking you for the courtesies shown me
as an official, I remain, sir, yours respect
fully, George B. Spkrby.
To-day every employe of the Sperry
Flour Company will receive this circular
in the envelope inclosing Ins pay :
To the employes of the Sperry Flour Com
pany: On to-morrow (Tuesday), election day,
ihe Sperry and Uniou mills will be closed
down and you are at liberty for the day. Work
will be resumed on Wednesday moruing. The
company expressly desires 10 impress on your
minds that each and every individual em
ploye, as a Ire- American citizen, is entitled
to and should give full, free and fair expression
through the ballot to hi-; sentiments and views
in regard to the issues to be determined oh
that day. In other words, in casting your bal
iot voie as you plense, wulioui :ear or lavor.

HIGH GALE OFF
COLUMBIA BAR
Danger to Ocean Shipping
From a Veritable
Hurricane.
Velocity of Eighty Miles an
Hour Registered at Fort
Canby.
HEAVY RAINS IN WASHINGTON
Immense Leg Jam Formed by the
Flood in Stillagnamisa
River.
SEATTTE, Wash., Nov. Lâ Weather
Observer Salisbury reports a southwest
gale of eighty miles an hour â the highest
velocity recorded during the year â blow
ing off Fort Canby, at the mouth of the
Columbia River. It is feared that vessels
that have lately crossed the bar or are
sailing toward it will en-counter grave
danger in tne blow.
News was received to-day that the Stil
laguami&h River in Snohomish County is
higher than it has been for years. The
freshet was caused by heavy rains which
are bringing down hundreds of logs to
Stanwood, where the river empties into
Puget Sound. An immense log jam has
been formed, cnoking the river from Stan
wood to a point a mile west.
This jam is estimated by loggers to con
tain over 20,000,000 feet of logs.
No steamer can get into the river and it
will take weeks to break the jam. So
great is the quantity of logs piled up that
the log market, which is just now very stiff
on account of foreign orders, will be affected
when the jam is broken and logs are avail
able for hauling to the mills.
In places the river is already overflow
ing the dikes. If it rises much higher
large tracts of farm land will be inundated.
The St llnguamiah is a swift mountain
stream, rising almost at the summit of the
Cascade Mountains and flowing into the
sound about thirty miles north of
Everett.
A YEAR OF PEACE.
The Church of the Holy Spirit Holds
Its Flrat Anniversary Services.
Tbe Lutheran Church of the Holy Spirit,
located at 2127 Jackson street, celebrated
its first anniversary yesterday. The or
ganization a year ago commenced ser
vices in a hall in the vicinity of its pres
ent edifice. Six months aero they entered
the chapel they now occupy. The church j
is what its pastor, Rev. 0. C. Miller, des
ignates a faith mission. No extreme
means, such as church fairs, lotteries, etc.,
are resorted to. The people simply enter
the church and have faith that the funds
will be forthcoming.
Yesterday's services were in recognition
of the lact that their faith has not been
in vain. Mr. Miller in preface to his ser
mon said:
A year has passed since the beginning of our
mission, and it stands to-Uay as a memorial of
God's faithfulness to answer prayer and pros
per those who trust in him to carry on his
work according to his own methods to the ex
clusion of all uiiscriptural methods for rais
ing money, such as fairs, festivals, etc.
Begun with nothing the work has been sus
tained aud advanced entirely by voluntary
offerings and has promptly met all monetary
obligations. Neither has there been any lack
of peace within the fold. We have dwelt to
gether in unity. Peace has reigned supreme.
The pastor's sermon was from the text,
"Bat covei earnestly the best gifts; and
yet show I unto you a more excellent
way," from First Corinthians, xii:3L

ELECTION DUTIES
ARE POINTED OUT
"Good Citizenship" Was
the Theme of Many
Preachers.
Words of Advice Spoken to Con
gregations of the
City.
WHAT THE NATION DEMANDS.
Dangers to the Republic Should Be
Faced by Conscientious
Voters.
In many pulpits of thÂ« City sermons
were delivered on subjects connected with
the elections. As far as practicable the
question of "good citizenship" was dis
cussed in the different pulpits.
Rev. W. D. Williams, D.D., preached on
"The Bitterness and Hopefulness of Pres
ent Politics" in the Plymouth Congrega
tional Church,
He declared that the present crisis
is the result of much that had gone before,
but yet there was hope. "Election by
selection shall be our duty in munici al
affairs," added Mr. Williams.
"We believe in parties, ye; in municipal
elections we desire very great latitude to
select, from the large number of nomina
tions, candidates whom we know person
ally or through others to be men noble
and true. Every citizen should regard
the duty of voting a sacred privilege,
never to be n glected. Election day
should be a National holiday, in order
that the greatest number possible should
have an uninterrupted opportunity to ap
proach the polls."
The Rev. W. W. Case, D.D.. spoke in
the Howard-street Methodist Church on
subjects bearing on the campaign. He
said that one danger to the Republic was
the heresy that "to the victors belong the
-poils," another that from money in elec
tions.
"The third danger," he said, "lies in the
apathy of the good people. Thousands of
respectable people never go near the pri
mary elections. When woman secures the
right to ballot she will not only go to the
primary elections, but will see that they
are held in respectable places. We shall
never have good government until good
and respectable men take a deep and
permanent interest in primary elections.
"Ignorance is the fourth danger. Large
numbers of voters cannot read their own
ballots, and have no idea of self-govern
ment, yet their votes are the same in the
ballot-box as those of any lawyer, physi
cian or public teacher. Our country is in
grave peril on account of this frightful
condition in the large cities.
"At the coming election the good citizen
will vote intelligently, soberly, patriotic*
ally and honestly."
In the First Presbyterian Church Rev.
R. Mackenzie preached on "Good Citizen
ship." In the course of his sermon he
said: "It takes just such a campaign as
this and such issues as are now in ques
tion to show some of us that the whole
duties of citizenship do not consist in col
lecting interest and in receipting for divi
dends. It takes such a campaign as this
to raise men to manhood and partisans to
patriots. lam thinking of that corrup
tion in municipal government by which
we are bought and sold as silly sheep and
which has made our City government the
byword of civilization.
"My auty is to call your attention to
these three lines of peril: The peril of
anarchy as against our National life, the
peril of bossisro as against our municipal
life and the peril of the liquor interference
with our home life. Your Christian in
telligence and conscience alone can prompt
you to individual action in the discharge
of your civic duties."
Tote for the solid Republican delega
tion to Congress. They trill help He-
Kinley to restore pronperity.

i^pon the subject of voting at the election
to-morrow. There was plenty of good
vocal and instrumental music.
Rev. W. W. Case delivered the principal
address, his subject being "Martin Luther
and the Reformation." In well-chosen
words Dr. Case paid a glowing tribute to
the German religious philosopher and de
scribed in detail his trials and tribulations
while resisting the authority of the Ro
man Catholic church. In the course of
his remarks he said :
He died rejoicing In the Protestant faith
quoting with great satisfaction many encour
aging passages from the Scriptures. It has
been thought that had it not been for the rise
ana spread of Romanism the millennium
would have come a thousand years ago.
But this terrible delusion of Satan, this gal
vanized paganism was, by a stupendous fraud
imposed upon Europe as the church of Jesus
Christ. â¢ â¢ â¢ The great German reformer
was the divinely selected switch-tender on the
ereat road of human progress, and he ran the
blood-reddened rickety Roman engine ofl the
track.
But its chief engineer, Leo XIII, still sticks
to the old machine, and not able any longer to
make fuel of Eibles and Protestants where
with to fire it up he amuses the age by throw
ing cold water on free schools, free presses and
free pulpits.
The world is prepared for the great reforma
tion. Invention has brought in many helps
for human progress.
Since the day when Luther protes'ed
against the most corrupt religious system of
the world has ever seen the wort of Luther
has developed increasing strength and in
fluence until the adherents of Protestantism
number 140,000,000. Those nations possess
ing the highest type of Christian civilization
are known as Protestants and the foundations
of their greatness were laid on the principles
of the reformation.
It seems Incredible that pure religion could
have been bo overladen with error as to be
changed into a hideous caricature of ita real
self. â¢ â¢ â¢
In taking a survey of the life and times of
Luther we are impressed with the malicious
and even fiendish malignity with which his
enemies pursued him. â¢ â¢ â¢ Even in our
days the dark and terri ble power which Luther
assailed and cast down has been lifting itself
up with renewed vigor.
FRACTURED HIS SKULL.
Charles Fitzgerald, a Young Man From
Oakland, Found Unconscious.
Charles Fitzgerald, a young man livinp
at 730 Chester street, Oakland, attended a
dance in the B'nai B'rith Hall, Eddy
street, last night and is now in the Be
ceiving Hospital suffering from a frac
tured skull.
About 9 o'clock Policeman Wilson wao
notified by the janitor that a man was
lying in the basement drunk. Wilson
went to the hall and just as he got "there
Fitzgerald was being led up the stairs
from the basement by two youn men.
Dr. Stice, on examining the wound in
Fitzgerald's scalp, found that his skull was
fractured, and Lieutenant Birdsall di
rected that an investigation be made.
The men who had charge of the dance de
clared that Fitzgerald had fallen down
stairs into the basement, but a young man
told Policeman Snowball that he over
heard two men talking about Fitzgerald
and wanting to "do him up" by hitting
him over the head with the butt end of a
pistol. Who the two men were ne pre
tended not to know, but tne police think
he^may yet tell a different story.
An Open Letter to Mr. Phelavn.
Sah Francisco, November 1, 1896.
To Mr. J. D. PhelanâDzKX Sib: At a
meeting of the Independent Dimond Club
to-day, in the presence of 500 people,

on the authority of Judge J. F. Sullivan,
who was present, that the responsibility
for the divided Democracy and for the
division among the opponents of the
A. P. A. rested entirely on James D.
Phelan. He further stated that the friends
of Mr. Dimond had in due time proposed
to Mr. Phelan that both be and Dimond
should withdraw, leaving ooth sections of
the party and all opponents of the A. P. A.
to unite upon and put forward a candi
date, and that Mr. Phelan had declined to
even consider the proposition, saying he
could not afforii to withdraw. What do
you, Mr. Phelan, ?ay to this? Please
reply in the evening papers.

REED ON A LONG DRIVE,
The Distinguished Statesman
Sees Local Points of
Interest
Will Visit Lick Observatory and Del
Monte Before Starting for Home
on Saturday.
Hon. Thomas B. Reed of Maine, in
company with Claus Spreckels, John D.
Spreckels, A. C. Spreckels, Misa Kitty
Reed and Mr. and Mrs. Aldrich, drove
through Golden Gate Park and then to
the Cliff House, where they had breakfast
shortly after noon within sight of the
grand Pacific Ocean. After the repastâ a
most enjoyable one â the party visited the
bat us, where they were met by Mayor
Sutro, who welcomed them to the estab
lishment and showed them all there was
to be seen in the vast place. They were
then invited to view the Heights.
The view from the heights pleased the
appreciative eye of Mr. Reed, who, in lan
guage such as only he can use, expressed
his admiration of it. The party remained
in the vicinity of the Cliff for nearly four
hours.
During the drive they inspected the Pre
sidio military reservation and fortifica
tions on this side of the bay and the Pa
vilion and different parts of the park.
To-day Mr. Reed will be about the Pal
ace Hotel until noon, when a committee
will escort him to Oakland, where he is to
speak. He will return to the hotel in the
evening. To-morrow he will spend driving
about the City observing the election ex
citement, and in the evening will be at
the Union League Club awaiting election
returns from the East.
Wednesday the party will start for Ban
Jose and Monterey, the purpose being to
visit the Lick Observatory on Mount
Hamilton and to spend several days
quietly at the Hotel Del Monte. Return
ing here Saturday the homeward journey
will be begun by way of Portland, Beattle
and trie Canadian Pacific, the plan being
to reach Portland, Me., on the 17th or 18th
of this month.
Miss Kitty Reed is something of a poli
tician herself and is very much in favor of
woman suffrage, though it is evident that
she could not vote for several years yet,
even if equal suftrage were in vogue in
Maine.
Mr. Reed hoped to visit the Yosemite,
but finds that he cannot spare the time, as
he has some important business to attend
to before leaving his home in Portland,
Me., to go to Washington.
SWALLOWED MORPHINE.
Dan Johnson, a Foundry-man, Dies at
the Receiving Hospital.
Dan Johnson, a foundryman living at 1
Gabriel place, committed suicide yester
day morning by swallowing a dose of
morphine.
He used to be foreman In McAllister's
foundry in Los Angeles, and came here
about two weeks ago with his wife and
family. He had been working for a few
days in a foundry on iTirst street.
Saturday night he and his wife, daugh
ter and one of his sons went to the theater.
He seemed in good spirits all night.and
when he retired to bed shortly after 11
o'clock, nothing unusual was observed in
his conduct.
When his wife awoke yesterday morn*
ing, she was alarmed by noticing that he
was breathing heavily. Sue tried to rouse
him up, but failed, and sent for a doctor.
The doctor ordered his removal to the
Receiving Hospital, but he was only there
about ten minutes when he expired.

"GOOD GOVERNMENT;"
ADDRESS
ââOF THE . : \V "
CITIZENS'
NON - PARTISAN PARTY!
TO THE
VOTERS OF SAN FRANCISCO.
The Citizens' Non-Partisan Party was called Into
existence by a condition of affairs In the City Gov-
ernment familiar to aIL - .^/. .;,
This deplorable condition continues In an aggra-
vated form.
It has therefore - nominated In the Interest of
good government,' and irrespective of party poli-
tics, a ticket which It asks the voters in the City to
support.
The return of the bosses to the scenes of their
nefarious operations, the failure of Justice In deal-
ng with these conspirators, and the open organi-
sation of corruption have compelled the Non-
Partisan Party to weed out doubtful or known bad
men, and place before the voters of this city men
who are believed to be honest and honorable. â 
Each candidate Indorsed by the Non-Partisans
has signed a pledge, which is on file with the sec-
retary, to conduct the affairs of the city economi-
cally, honestly, and ,on business principles, and
embracing the following obligations:
Provide for the fullest ' enjoyment of religious
liberty;
Public schools to be liberally supplied and eco-
nomically managed;
Total tax levy not to exceed $1 on the SIOQ on
assessed value of $300,000,000. â¢
One-twelfth Act rigidly enforced, and no ex-
penses Incurred except by authority of the Super-
visors;
Golden Gate Park to be Improved for Vie benefit
of the people; expense not to exceed 6 cents on the
*100.
Streets and sewers to be Improved, superintend-
ent to be a civil engineer, and business methods
employed:
" Eight hours a day's work ; home labor and ma-
terial to be preferred In all cases: - ,
County Clerk's office to be run within Â«6000 per
month;
City and Conntv Surveyor's fees, cost of janitor
service at City Hall, and shorthand reporting, to
be reduced ,
All departments of City Government to be re-
moved from partisan politics;
Free use of Telephone by City; no franchise or
extensions granted without direct benefit to City.
It is the purpose of the Citizens' Non-Partisan
Party to see, as far as In Its power, that such can-
didates. If elected, shall carry out their pledge to
the latter.
Every citizen recognizes the demoralised condi-
tion of our Municipal Government, and will admit
that constant watchfulness Is necessary to stamp
out existing abuses and ptevent the . growth of
others.
Good officers need their arms strengthened
against schemers and temptation, and faithful
officers are entitled to support ; while those I who
fall In their duty, or yield to the debasing Influ-
ence of the bosses, or to the direct or Indirect
bribes of corporations, should >be made to feel th*
strong arm of the law.
The Citizens' Non-Partisan Party's aim Is to se-
cure to the City of San Francisco a good govern-
ment, and for this purpose its organisation will
continue until Its aim Is accomplished.
It Is therefore Justified In asking the effective
and earnest support of ' all 'citizens : of San Fran-
cisco, Irrespective ot party politics, In its efforts to
â â¢cure at the coming elect ion good officers for th*
City of San Francisco. , : ' : â

33 Grant Avenue, San I'raucisco.THE SUNLIGHT
WAS TOO STRONG
And Somewhat Affected
the Rifls Scoring
Yesterday.
Monthly Medal Shoots at Schuet
zen Park Were Well
Attended.
PKIVATE MATCH NIXT SUNDAY
Cimparatively Few Clubs Went Out
to She 1 Mound, hut Competi
tion Was K;en.
There was preat activity at the Schuet
zen Park ranges yesterday afternoon, but
the turnout at Shell Mound was rather
smaller than usual. At both places, owing
â¢ to the strong yet uncertain sun.'ight, the
scoring rarely rose above the average.
Nevertheless, though no records were
broken, every club represented did fairly
well, and competition in all cases proved
keen and exciting.
The Schuetzen Park programme con
sisted of monthly medal shoots almost ex
clusively, in which the following took
part: The California Schuetzen club, the
Grutli Shooting Section, the Verein Ein
tracht and companies D andH ofjthe First
Regiment, N. G. C, from San Francisco
and of the Fifth from San Rafael, respec
tively. Nearly forty members shot at the
ranges ot the California Schuetzen Club,
and the other club ranges were propor
tionately well patronized.
In the course of the afternoon F. C. Mul
ler of Company H undertook to shoot
against time and succeeded in firing ten
shots in two minives, with a score of 43
out of a possible 50. It should also be
added that be received no assistance what
ever in loading. One other rather unusual
incident marked a somewhat uneventful
day. August Hampei, who is generally
conceded to be the prospective winner of
the California Schuetzen Club's $20 medal
in tne fourth class, managed to add a
pigeon to his list of trophies. This he
accomplished unintentionally, the bird
crossing the line of fire just as he dis
charged his rifle.
A. Strecker of the same club again car
ried off the championship-class medal
. witn a score of 423 rings. J. Utschig won
second prize witu a score of 415. in the
Grutli Club's competition F. Baumgart
ner came first with 409 rings, while the
first-class medal fell to U. Diethelm. who
scored 401. J. Young of the Verein Ein
tractit was awarded the meual in the
championship class for a score of 403
rings, T. Binner followine with 305 points.
In the case of the two company medal
shoots, the scores of wnich are appended,
the final award will not be made unti! the
end of the year and will be decided by the
highest aggregate score for ihe twelve
monthly stioots. The last of the series
will take place on the first Sunday in De
cember. Following are the complete

THE ARRIVAL OF TROOPS.
Historic Battery of Light Artillery
That Saved the Day at Buena
Vista.
The batteries of the Third Artillery, U.
S. A., Colonel E. C. Bainbridge, recently
transferred fro:.: Florida, Louisiana,
Texas and Washington Barracks, are now
here at their respective stations in this
harbor. Captain Potts, Light Battery F,
from San Antonio, Texas, arrived la^t
Saturday and is now at the Presidio. Cap
tain Smith, foot battery, from Key West,
arrived yesterday forenoon via Los
Angeles. Captain Lancaster, Light Bat
tery C, from Washington Barracks, ar
rived last evening via Ogden. These two
batteries also go to the Presidio.
Light Battery C is an organization that
holds a place in history. At the battle of
Buena Vista, Mexico, the battery was
commanded by Captain Braxton Bragg,
who subsequently attained the rank of
major-general in the Confederate Army.
When the fortunes of the day at Buena
Vista were in doubt and the Mexicans
were massing superior numbers against
the American army, General Taylor
noted the skillful manner in which
Captain Bragg was handling his bat
tery of light artillery. Tradition says
that General Taylor rode to the guns
and accosting the battery commander said,
"A little more grape, Captain Bragg."
Artillerymen and staff officers who card
what was really sad assert that the hero
of Buena Vista did not say anything of
the kind, but used ianeuage of an em
phatic character, the meaning of which
might be conveyed in a newspaper by a
display of dashes and exclamation points.
It was the kind of language that is often
used in the crisis of battle, and which the
men now composing the battery would
comprehend shou d occasion require it
General Taylor did say in his official re
port of the bloodiest battle of the Mexi
can war that this battery saved the day. â 
\Lieutenant-Colonel Williston, com
manding the post at the Presidio, has is
sued Special Orders No. 193, of whicc the
following is a paragraph:
"Battery G, Third Artillery, is especially
detailed to take charge of the care and
preservation of the guns, slopes and
grounds generally of the new batteries,
and will furnish all details, including
working partie-, in connection therewith
upon application of First Lieutenant J. D.
Miley, Fifth Artillery, who is charged
with the responsibility and given full con
trol of the guns and material as ordnance
officer. During this detail the battery will
be excused from all post duty, except
active euard duty. This will not relieve
the officÂ«rs of the battery from court-mar
tia: duty."
When the lour troops of the Fourth
Cavalry return from the duty of guarding
the forest reserves in the mountain parks
the garrison at the Presidio will cons'st of
twelve companies â two light and two ioot
batteries of the Third Artillary, four
troops of v the Fourth Cavalry and four
companies of the First Infantry. It is
claimed by some critics that the Presidio
is essentially an artillery post, and that
all the batteries in the harbor should be
coucentrated there. The critics overlook
the fact that the Presidio is a mainland
post adjacent to a large city. Surely it is
a good disposition of forces to have artil
lery, infantry ana cavalry immediately
available.
Colonel Shatter, 'commanding the De
partment of California, has issued general
orders No. 10, directing that artillery in
struction shail be resumed to-day. Fol
lowing is the text of the order:

FRANCK SWUNG
HIS MIGHTY BAT
Sent the Ball Over the
Fence and Won the
Game.
Cummings Made a Record â a
Home Run â and Brought
In Three Men.
IT WAS AN UF-HILL GAME.
The Tuffs-Lyons of Los Angeles Won
a Great Victory Over the
Portlani Monogrcms.
It was a wonderful game.
The Monograms showed themselves
again to be great sprinters, but they can
not play ball alongside of the lads from
the sunny south in a drawn-out game.
The last two matches piayei at Central
Park are illustrations of the assertion that
the Tufts- Lyons nine of Los Angeles, even
bereft of their crackerjack pitcher, Harvey,
can give the Weblooters "cards and
spades."
A week ago the Monograms scored 9 to
oin the first tix innings. Affairs looked
discouraging for the boys from the south.
They recouped, however, in the end,
making a tie game of 12 runs in twelve
innines.
Tnis performance was regarded as sim
ply grand, and when game was called
yesterday for the return match Central
Park was more crowded than it has ever
been in its nistory.
The game was very much a repetition
of tue one had a week previous. The
Portland players went off with a rush.
Los Angeles was not in it for five innings.
They managed to get in three Hard-earned
runs in tb.e hrst iour innings, against
which score they had eleven runs for the
Monograms.
From the very start last week the Los
Ange.es team was behind nine runs, and
j here they found themselves eight behind,
the game almost naif over. It was up-hill
play, and it proved again to be just their
i sty.c and trait.
In the fifth inning they scored two, as
j against one for the other slue, following
1 it up with two, as against a goose-egg.
In the fifth inning came ihe real turn
; ing of the tide. Cummings, one of the
I heroes of tne day, made a two-base hit,
I bringing in two men. In the eighth mi
i niug he again distinguished himself.
There were three men on bases. Tyler, at
the bat, was hit by the pitcher and given
i a base, allowing Franck to score a run.
j Htill there were three on bases and Cum-
I rnings at the bat.
He struck Ray clear over the left-field
I fence, bringing in three men and scoring
i a home run for himself, the only one
I of the aay.
Tne game stood 14 to 13 in favor of the
Monograms when the latter went to the
bat. They were put out one, two, three,
leaving the Tufts-Lyons in the last half of
the ninth inning to make up the score in
which they were on>: behind.
Two men on r -s, ons batter out on
I strikes and Francic, the shortstop, stood
in the place of Ernest T haver's "Casey at
the Bat." It was different this time.
Neideruark, the south-paw pitcber who
I had been made to replace Ray, put the
j ball just right, and over the left field for
I the second time it flew.
Two runs were scored and the Los An
geles boys won the day, making 15 to 14.
Francfc, whose batting gained urn victory,
was credited officially with a two-b&gger
wnen really he made a home run. His
score war* not needed.
The Tufts- Lyons now stand the cham
pions of the coast. The Nevada Sta^s are
equally undefeated and it is now to be seen
whether ihe latter will accept the offer
made them to play the winners of yester
day's game. They have some grievance
however, and diplomacy of no mean order
will have to be brought to bear to make
them return to California for a game.
They claim tnat having beaten the
Alerts of Alameda they should not be
again called upon to play another Califor
nia team. Hud the Monograms of Oregon
won things would nave been different.
Tney would have played them for the
championship.
They will be expected to play the Tufts-
Lyons next Sunday for the trophy.

PLAYED ON WET GROUNDS.
San Franclscos Beat the Oaklands
by a Score of 4 to 2.
The going at the Folsom-street ball park
yesterday was hard in some spots, slushy
in others and good in none. The players
slipped and slid about like smooth-shod
Bay District selling platers, and evinced a
decided aversion to the mud. Despite the
disadvantageous circumstances the game
during the last eight innings was the best
seen in fcan Francisco for many moons.
The Oaklands crossed the bay accompa
nied by an energetic, fully developed hoo
doo, and It worked overtime. Although
they outbatted their opponents two to
one'and played without an error after the
initial inning they only scored half as
many runs. Russel, too, excelled Cooney
and pitched what would nine times out of
ten be a winning game. He struck out
five men and gave but two basea on balls.
He also accepted seven chances for an as
-Bist, without a misplay.
In the opening inning the San Fran
clscos score*! four runs, the only ones they
made. Monahan got a base on balls, Krug
advanced him to third on Sirocco's error
and then stole second. Murphy hit safely
and Monahan and Krug scored. Mertes
got a life on Pequipney's fumble, Murpby
going to third. Mertes promptly stole
second, and both scored on Beckett's hit.
In the fifth the Oaklands got two men

across the plate. Donovan was hit by a
pitched ball and Van Haltren lined out a
safe one. Both completed the circuit on
Wolter's two-bagger. That ended the
run-getting of the game, which abounded
in brilliant plays, no iets than three of the
visitors being pnt out at home.
Mortes of the Pmladelnhias played third
for the local men, and Hunt of the Texas
League caught for Oaicland. Van Haltren
of the New Yorks also played cen;erfor
the visitors. All played excellently and
without an error.

VALLOS' VALE.
They Give Their Farewell Outing;
Hound the Bay.
The Valloss Aquatic Club terminated
its outing season yesterday by giving a
trip around the bay to a few of its
friends on the speedy launch Wildwood.
The start was made from Clay-street
wharf at 10 o'clock a. m., after which the
flagship Philadelphia was visited; then a
stop was made at the Dolphin Swimming
I Club at North Beach and their quarters
inspected. From there the next landing
was made at Alcatraz Island, where a
tour of the grounds and the magnificent
view obtained lrom the heights was ap
preciated by all. Tne clear day and ca.m
ness of the waters made the scene toward
the Golden Gate a decidedly picturesque
one. The final stop was made on the
eastern Bhores of Marin County above
California City, where a splendid luncheon
was spread by the young ladies in the
group.
Admiral Hiller and Captain Joly added
much merriment to the occasion by their
clever acrobatic feats, and G. C. Gunther
captured all the honors for political
speeches. Seven o'clock found them all
back at Clay-street wharf again, ana it
was the unanimous vote thai the day had
been all that could be desired. Those par
ticipating in the day's pleasure were tte
Misses Tress Mayer, Acgie Boyd, Birdie
Mayer, Lottie Kumpf, Louise Kumpf,
Elsie Boyd, Loivse Bordfeld, Laura Uta
cbig, Lillie Vlantic, Gussie Stoer, Mrs.
Smith, F. Smith, L. B. Maver, J. G. Joly,
G. C. Gunther, J. Hiller, James NaÂ«le, P.
Vlantin, D. Connolly, H. Bordfeld, C.
tstroecker and J. Crowley.
The trace-workers of California knoir
where their interests lie and require no
coercion to insure their votei for Me-
Kinley.
Two hundred new designs in penny
toys are brought out every week in White
chapel.
SOME ROUGH POLITICS,
Second Ward Ruifians Molest a
Boy and an Old
Horse
The Haskins Pu^h Obj cts to the
Perambulating Transparency of
Candidate E hriein.
The followers of the Supervisorial can
didates for the Second Ward are doing
some rough politics, and it is not unlikely
tat some of them may land themselves
in the calaboose before many moons.
The "push" behind Thomas H. Haa
kins, the Democratic candidate, is partic- j
ularly in earnest, to a point of aggressive- j
ness that makes life and limb precarious
wtierever the opposing factions meet.
Haskins' followers, led en by a sub-boss
called Lanizan. have a great dislike for
the forces of Emil Kehrlein, who is also
the nominee of the' Democracy and the
Anti-Charter party.
Laniiran's men have made it their par
ticular business during the past week to
hunt up Kehrlein literature and other |
matter calculated to do a candidate some
good in election times and destroy it.
But, as election day grew closer and
vancta ism was still overlooked by the po- |
lief, the destroyers were emboldened.
Two nights ago, at the corner of Mis
sion and Eleventh streets, the climax
came, and now Charles Gautert, a lad ot I
15 years of ace. lies abed ai his home, and i
a dozen young hoodlums are seeking !
shelter from policemen who have warrants
for their arrest.
Charles Gautert was driving a skinny
old horse through the Mission, advocating ]
Kehrlein's candidacy by means of a four- !
sided canvas transparency. He was ob- I
served by a crowd of tough characters,
who immediately proceeded to interfere
with the wagon.
"Get off tne earth!" they shouted, and
when the drive- failed to vanish with his
horse, wagon and transparencies they as
Â»aiied all of them in true Indian style.
The young boy was dragged off the seat
and hit in the face, and had to oe lifted
from the pavement, wnere he lay uncon
scious after the ruffians had run away.
The poor old horse also was jerked about
ana mauled until he was barely able to
stand.
As for the transparency, it was but a
memory when the rowdies got through
with it.
McKtnley and Hobart stand f>r Na
tional honor, protection and prosper
ity.
AN EX-PRESIDENT'S SON.
Chester A. Arthur Here With His Sis
ter on a Pleasure Trip.
Chester A. Arthur, son and namesake of
the late President of the United States, is
here with his sister, Miss Arthur, for a
short visit in San Francisco, to be followed
by a tour of the well-known points of in
terest in the southern part of the State.
They are at the Palace Hotel.
Mr. Artnur is a capitalist of New York
City. This is the first time that he or
i Miss Arthur has been farther west than
I the Mississippi. For the last five weeks
Mr. Arthur has been shooting and fishing
in Idaho, but both he and his sister felt
; that they should not return home without
i seeing California after they had come so
I near, "so," remarked the ei-President's
! son, "we came down here with our hunt
i ing clothes on."
He is a tall, athletic appearing man
perhaps 30 years of ago, with dark hair
and n small Napoleonic mustache.
"I shall lose my vote," he said, "but
New York does* not need it; the State, I
knew before I left, wouM give an over
whelming majority to McKinlev. I wish
I might have cast my vote in Idaho, but
'< while I was tliera I tried to do a little
quiet work for tne right cause. Tnat
I State will give Bryan a majority, but the
Republicans will win in the Legislature.
"While in the Rocky Mountains I nad
first-iate hunting and no end of trout fish
ing. I killed some fine elk and a bear,
and for smaller game lota of ducks, sage
hens and grouse.
"We shall visit the Yosemite, Del
Monte, Los Angeles, Santa Barbara and
other interest!!i places during the next
two weeks. WÂ« hope to reach home in
about three weeks."
Let every Republican in San Fran
cisco vote to-morrow, ra n or stal o.

FOB PRESIDENTâ
" '.. WILLIAM McKINLEY, of Ohio
fOB VICK-PRESIDE3CTâ
GARRET A. HOBART, of New Jersey
Election November 3, 1&96.
To-morrow we Tote.
To-day we get ready.
Cali'ornia will vote right.
Work for the whole ticket.
It will be President McKinley.
One day more and the agitation is over.
Make it a certainty for Mayor Taylor.
' Don't forget the legislative ticket and
the next Senator.
At last Bryan has himself at his tongue's
end.
.Business will soon resume with rising
prices.
Sound sense knows the value of sound
money.
Bryanism is (Jlevelandism run mad and
going to the dogs.
The uprising of the people means the
oi the depression.
The American people can be counted on
to repudiate repudiation.
What will it profit any man to depreci
ate the American dollar?
You are sure to win with McKinley and
you are sure to lbse with Bryan.
Put not your trust in Non-Partisans, for
no man knoweth what they stand for.
From Maine to California it will be a
clean sweep for protection and prosperity.
Why not hang out the flags on election
day and keep up the fervor of patriot
ism?
Let us see if we cannot make San Fran
cisco the banner Republican county of the
State.
Victory to-morrow depends largely on
work to-day. Let us leave nothing to
chance.
Talk to your friends and see that they
make np their minds to vote rigbt to
morrow.
No more free trade, no more deficits, no
more bond sales, no more increase of the
public de"bt.
Send no free- trader to Congress, we have
had enough of that kind for the rest of
this generation.
No Popocrat need fear coercion at the
polls. Good citizens will have votes
enough without them.
We know our people are all right for
protection, but we should make it as
nearly unanimous as possible.
Tne welfare of your business is depend
ent on the election of BdcKinley and
Hobart and don't you forget it.
Maryland will down Gorman, Illinois
will down Altjreld, California will down
Cator, and the Nation will down Bryan.
The municipal ticket headed by Colonel
Taylor means true Republicanism and
good government. Work for it and vote
for it.
To have a Republican United States
Senator who will support the McKinley
administration we must have a Repub.i
can Legislature. Bear that in mind and
work to that end.
The full Republican vote should be
polled to-morrow for the regular Republi
can ticket. Make it a great victory for
loyal Republicanism.
This will be the last year of Bryan,
Altgeld and Tillman in National politics!
They may disturb their home people to
some extent hereafter, but they will never
disturb the Nation any more.
To make sure that the indnstries of Cal
ifornia will be guarded from foreign com
petition we must put none but protection
ists on guard in Congress. Let us have a
solid Republican delegation and be oi the
safe bide.
We have the same interests as we have
the same country, and tbere can be no
class antagonism among the American
people so long as all are actuated by a true
patriotism and devotion to the welfare of
the Nation.
San Francisco cannot afford to make an
experiment with an untried man in the
Mayor's office, nor can she afford to elect
any man nominated by Buckley, Rainey
or Kelly. The man for the time, the work
and tbe office is Charles L. Taylor.
The Congress to be elected to-morrow
will have the important work of revising
and reforming the tariff, and every dis
trict in California should have a strong
champion of home industries to look after
its interests when the new tariff bill is
being drawn up.
HOW WILL YOU VOTE?
Voters of San Francisco, how will you
vote to-morrow? That is thci question
you must decide to-day, if you have not
already decided. Tne answer can be no
longer postponed. Even the most waver
ing, hesitating and doubtful must make
up their minds now. The issues have
been fully set before you during the cam-
Daign. How are you going to vote?
How will you vote on the tariff ques
tion? Will you vote for the policy which
in twenty-three years lowered our interest
bearing National debt from over $2,000,
-000,000 to $585,000,000, or will you vote for
a policy which in time of peace increased
the bonded debt by $1G2,OOO,OOO? Will you
vote fora policy which left a surplus in
the treasury every year after large appro
priations for public improvements, or for
a policy which under enforced economy
has resulted in a deficiency of neariy $'JOO,
-000,000 in three years?
How will you vote on the money ques
tion? Will you vote to depreciate the
American dollar to the value of 50 cents?
Will you vote to diminish the purchasing
power of the wa^es of labor? Will you
vote to reduce the value of your savings in
the banks? Will you vote to cut in half
the value of your insurance policy? Will
you vote to reduce the value of the pen
sions paid to the soldiers in the war for
the Union and their widows and oiphans?
Will you vote to repudiate one-half the
National debt? Will you vote for dis
honor to the financial credit of the Na
tion? Or will you vote for sound money,
honesty, justice to yourself and all who
have saved money, fair pensions to the
Nation's veterans, and the stainless honor
and integrity of the Republic?
How will you vote on the right of the
National Government to enforce its laws?
How will you vote on the questiou of
maintaining the dignity of the Supreme
Court? Will you vote to weaken the Na
tional Government, and revive the cause
which surrendered at Appomattox? Will
you vote for lawlessness against law?
Will you vote for Altgeld, Tillman, Coxey
and Debs, or will you vote to maintain
the strength of the Nation, the enforce
ment of its laws and to keep the Supreme
Court in the future as it has been in the
past the guardian of the rights of the
American people ana the temple of invio
late justice?
These are the questions for you to
answer by your votes to-morrow. They
are not idle questions. They have not
bpen brought up as mere matters of de
bate. They are issues of practical politics.
Tney are to be settled by the votes on
election day. You cannot shir* them.
Not to vote would' be to weaken the
strength of the patriots who are going to
vote right. Therefore the question comes
to you as one of solemn responsibility.
How are you going to vote to-morrow?
The Issued of this campaign cannot be
overstated In their importance. Shall
we sustain law and order and uphold
the tribunals of justice wh'ch in all the
trying times of the past have been our
greatest safety and our pride? Shall
we continue a financial policy which is
aafe and sound and gives to us a money
with which to do a business that is
stable In value and commands respect,
not only at home, but in every commer
cial ntion of the world ? On these
questions there should be no two opin
ions. â McKinley.
TO-DAY'S DUTY.
The duty of Republicans to-day is to
arrange to bring out the full vote of the
party to-morrow. Every Republican
should resolve to attend to this duty for
himself and see to it that such of his
neighbors as may be indifferent or careless
do not neglect to go to tne polls and vote
for McKinley and Hobart and the whole
ticket.
There are always men who permit some
trifling call of tbe day to lead them to
overlook the high privilege of voting for
the men who are to administer the affairs
of the Nation, tbe State and the Qity.
These men should be made aware of the
responsibility that rests upon them. The
business and the industry of every man is
concerned in the outcome of this election.
There is hardly a man in California who
could not better afford to close up his
business altogether on Tuesday than to
lose the chance of casting a vote for pros
perity.
This then i 3 the duty of the day. Talk
to your friends and neighbors. Remind
them of tbe great issues at stake. Impress
upon them the responsibility of citizen
ship. Urge upon them the demands of
patriotism. Obtain from them a promise
that under no circumstances will t ey
fail to go to the polls to-morrow and vote
right.
The argument of the campaign has re
sulted in a Republican triumph, but the
final test will be tne votes on election dsy.
It will matter little if a man thinks right
if he does not vote right. It was good to
work for McKinley during the campaign,
it was excellent to march in tbe grand
nrocession of Saturday, but tnat which is
best remains to be done. Every citizen
must vote. Every patriot must vote for
'ound money, protection, prosperity and
National honor. Resolvn in your own
mind that you will not fail in this duty
and resolve also that you will do all in
your power to get others to be equally
faithful to the welfare of â¦he Nation.
The only -way to improve our condition
is to increase business. Let us do our
owu man u acturirg. L,ct us do onr own
inlDing and let us preserve our own
hÂ«m- marketâ the best market in the
world. And let us dedicate ourselves as
pauiots to the promotion of the high
est Interests of the American people. I
believe in m tariff, and If we ever ueeded
a tariff in the world -we need it now. â
McKinley.

Charles L. Taylor should receive the

ingman.
This is no time to make experiments
with untried men. 'Ihis ia no time to
trust men who are backed by Buckley or
Rainey or Kelly. If the new charter
should bo adopted the Mayor will have
most important duties to fulfill and for
the good of the City it is imperative that
he should be a man upright in himself
and free from evil associations. The man
for the City, the man for the time, the
man for the people and the man for the
office is Charles L. Taylor. Work for Him
to-day, vote for him to-morrow.
Having prevented legislation to pro
vide sufficient revenue to run the Gov
ernment, Sir. Bryan, and hi* supporters
lake every occasion j.lso to declare that
they are opposed to borrowing in time
of pence. But if tiiey will neither fur
nish sufficient revenue to carry on the
Government nor permit borrowing to
meet the deficiency, then the only al
ternative is for the Government to stop.
Is that their programme ?â Hon. Nelson
Diugley. \
DEFEAT MAGUIRE.
It is the clear, logical and patriotic duty
of the Republicans of the Fourth Con
gressional District to defeat James G. Ma
guire and to elect a Republican to Con
gress in his place. This is a duty tp party
and to principle, without refejence to tiie
merits of individual men. Mr. Maguire is
a Democrat and a free trader of the most
extreme type. He has never cast his vote
in Congress for the protection of an
American industry and he never will. If
the Republican National ticket shall pre
vail and if Mr. Maguire should be re
elected he will be found opposing every
effort of the administration to restore
prosperity by means of protection and
liehting the battls of free trade whenever
and wherever the issue is joined. Let the
Republicans of his district remember this
fact upon election day, and when they
cast their ballot for McKinley and protec
tion let them not stultify themselves by
voting for Maguire and free trade.
The career of Mr. Maguire in Congress
durin .â¢ the past two terms has not jus
tified his return. When asked by bis con
stituents what he tins done for his district
he is unable to point to the pages of the
Congressional Record which contain a
satisfactory reply. The people of Ban
Francisco expected much from Mr.
Maguire in the way of accelerating the
procurement of our new Postoffice build
ing, but their expectations hay not been
realized. The time which he mignt have
well spent in urging the authorities at
Washington to action in this matter
he preferred to occupy in making
speecfcps down in Delaware upon
the subject of the single tax. T c
influence which he mieht hay.- wielded
with the administration in securing needei
appropriations for Ihe improvement of the
harbor must have been otherwise em
ployed. In short, the utility of Mr. Mb
guire as a Congressman is not discernible
to the people of San Francisco, nor is there
any reason which can be assigned why his
re-election should be made possible by Re
publican votes. The plain duty of the Re
publicans of his district is to cast their
ballots for Thomas B. O'Brien on next
Tuesday, and thus insure tbe election of a
Republican Congressman from the Fourth
Congressional District.who may be counted
upon to sustain every effort of a Republi
can administration to enact such protec
tive legislation as will restore prosperity
to the land.
In it not a campaign connis'lng of an
appeal to ignorance ? Is it not a cam
paign of an appeal to falsehood? Is it
not appealing to dishonor and dis
honesty, ai>d, finally, a campaign resting
on an appeal to hatred, envy, malice,
and all uncharitabieness ? This, gentle
men, is what distinguigiiea this cam
paign broadly and sharply from any
other political campaign ivhich any of
us have any knowledge of. It is this
that makes it a fight which puts at
hazard and imperils the foundation
of society Itself It is Ihis considera
tion which niHk x It in a high degree
proper that we should all forget our
forninr party alliances and connections
and unite together, earnestly, sincerely
and enthusias'ically in one effort to
finally get rid of such a pestilential
heresy as that which Bryan i-t endeav
oring to propagate.â Hon. James C. Car
ter of New York
THE NEXT SENATE.
Among the Senators whose terms of office
expire on the 4th of next March are
thirteen Republicans. Political experts
concede the certain* v that all of these will
be returned or that Republican successors
will be elected for them except in the case
of tbe Senators from North Carolina and
California, it is to be regretted that even
the least sanguine of experts should have
any doubt concerninz this State. The in
dustries of California require protection
and it shows a most perverse state of pub
lic opinion that there should be any ques
tion as to whether or no the California
Legislature will Bend a stanch protection
ist to the Senate next year.
The only danger that lies in the way of
electing a Republican Senator is the fusion
which has been brought about between
the Populists and ths Democrats of the
State. There are abundant evidences that
the fusion managers have prepared to sac
rifice Bryan to gain the next Senator.
They see no hope of the election of a free
silver President, but they be.ieve that they
can control the Senate and thus, by pre
venting the passage of a protective tariff
bill which would restore the prosperity of
the country, keep alive the present discon
tent and give themselves a caance for bo t
ter success four years from now.
The real fight of the campaign, there
fore, is for the Senate. Bryan is defeated.
The free-silver candidates for tbe Senate,
however, still have hopes of success. In
every State where there is a possibility of
electing one of them tbe fuMo.i managers
will direct every effort to that end. It is
against these efforts that Republicans
must now be on their guard.
Tne likelihood of the success of tbe fusion
managers in California has been largely
diminished by the character of the man
whom they have put in the forefront of
the contest as their candidate for the Sea
ate. Mr. Cator represents no interest in
California and no strong sentiment among
its people. He doe* not repr sent the
Populist rank and file, though be is tbe
choice of tbe convention of that party,
and he is in no sense of tbe word the rep
resentative of Democracy. He has been
put upon Democrats by a trade for which
they are not responsible and which the
better element among them will hardly
support.
Nevertheless tba danger must not be
overlooked. Among the features of the
campaign to which close attention roust
be given by Republicans and honest
money Democrats is that of tbe election
of a Republican legislative ticket. Let
every good citizen bear this io mind: To
assure tbe passage of a protec live- tar iff
law and the restoration of prosperity to
California we must send a loyal Republi
can to the Senate, and that can b done
only by the election of loyal Republicans
to the State Legislature.
let every Republican rmiember to
vote for the regular republican Legis
lative nomlueea and thim Insure the
election of a 1-epubllcan Senator.
NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES
The naval arsenal at Foochow is again to be
reorganized. It vt as started on the European
plan in the early sixties, with French officers
and a number of .foreign engineers and me
chanics for a staff engaged to build ships, en
gines and euris. After a few years the foreign
ers were dispensed with ai:d the Chinese con
tinued the work begun, but made no progress,
as they simply duplicated ships built years
a;ro. The recent war with Japan has opened
the eyes of the Emperor's advisers, and Gen
eral Yu Lv has been placed in charge of the
Foochow arsenal. After consultation with a
French naval officer it has been decided to en
gage another corps of French naval ship
wrights, engineers and other mechanics, with
three su^rintendeuts, each of whom are to be
paid $1500 a month. Seven professors at a
monthly ba.ary oi $320 each are to come out
from England to take charee of the naval
bcbool located at Foochow.
The experiment of , building engines and
boilers in the dockyards has proved a success
in the British navy. __ It was the practice, until
six years ago, to give all the engines and boil
ers to private firms, but the good and econom
ical work dove on the Gleaner has proved
that the dockyard force can turn out as good
machinery at a reasonaDlo cost as they can
build ships. The advantages of having all parts
of a vessel built at one place are apparentâ the
costly plants are utilized and the Government
becomes less dependent on outside private
firms.
The British Admiralty is introducing water
tube boilers of different patterns In several
snip?, with a view of practically testing their
merits. The Babcocic and Wilcox is being
fitted in the Sheldrake, the Salamander has
the Thornycroft, the Belleville was put in the
Sharpshooter some time ago, and the Niclause
as well as the Dv Temple boilers will be placed
In two other vessels of the same class as those
above mentioned, which are all gunboats of
735 tons and 4500 horse-power.
Spain has ordered a cruiser from an Italian
firm. Tbe vessel will be similar to the Gari
baldi, built in Italy and Hold to the Argentine
Republic. Stie will be (is-iO tons and Is to de
velop a speed of twenty to twenty-one knots
with 15,000 horsepower.
Messrs. Krupp of Essen have purchased the
Germania Ship-Building Works at Kiel and
Germania Marine-Engine Works at Tegel, near
Berlin. They have also rurchosed ground at
Wilhelmshafen, where they Â«re building
works and docks suitable for repairing irou
clads and placing eng'nes on board. It la
understood the Krupps have taken this step
on the suggestion of the Emperor as there is
difficulty of securing the requisite money from
parliament for the extension of ship-building.
The pu. chase will enable the Krupp firm to
supply ship-of-war complete with armament
ready for service.
The Armstrong Company at Elswick has
signed a contract with the Spanish Govern
ment agreeing to build a battleship of 11,000
tons in fourteen mouths for $4,500,000 and a
cruiser of 0000 tons in twelve months ior
$3,000,000.

DEFEAT WOULD BE LUCKY FOR HIM
Brooklyn I agio.
It is because we believe that what he has
said so plainly and simply would come up to
torment him in the White House that we
are convinced that defeat would be the best
thing that could happen to him. He has
toid the farmers that they would get twice
as much for their crips it he were elected,
and he has also told the workingmen that
their wanes would buy just as much with
free coinage as they do now. He baa made
this so clear that no one can mistake him.
Many farmers and workmgmeu will vote
for him because they be.kve what he tells
them. Bnt the things which he promises he
cannot fulfill.
Mr. Bryan needs to learn that whatever the
experience of the civilized world has found .o
be the test policy under given circumstances
cannot taiih be proved ;o be the worst. It
may not be ideal, but it bus been adopted be
cause it was better than that wnxh preceded
it. If he should happen to be elected he will
wish beiore the end of his term that he had
been defeated, and If he is defeated he will
thank Providence that he was not called upon
to face tbu disasters which would hay* fol
.owed the free coinage of si ver.

-000.000 wil. be placed in circulation within a
few weeks after tue election of McKinley.
This money ia being fioarded by big and little
capitalists, who, though they believe Bryan's
defeat is certain, still care to take no risks,
With the result that they are waiting until the
decision is rendered, when' in every city in
this country : u.-tness enterprises will take on
new lite, forges will be relighted, factory
wheels will turn again, banks w 11 circulate
their treasure and workfngmen, farmers, ar
tisans, clerks, merchants middlemen and
capitalists will b gin the new epoch In Ameri
can history filled with courage born of honest
enthusiasm.
We J? ay never know the damage that Bryan
and the repudiationists have done in this
country, Every State has lost millions of
aiÂ« l /i Slnce the Populists in Chicago de
ciarea tor a based currency. Every capital
ist and workingman has shared in this loss.

Why JZrery Sound- Monty Democrat
MinulU Va*t His Vote for
JSlcKlnte/f.
The argument on free silver at lt> to 1 is
closed and tbere is not a snred of fact or reason
left to justify popular support of a depreciated
currency. I am and have been since his nomi
nation opposed to the election of W. J. Bryan.
First, as an American, and second, as a Deruo-'
crat. I recognize the grievances an'l the just
demands of the people, oppose par-tonalities
and believe party methods require reconstruc
tion. But this has 'been the campaign of tlia
non-sequitur as mad* by the advocate* of free
silver. Many of the promises are sound, but
they are wholly disconnected from the conclu
sion. The money power has been aggressive
and successful, but us victories ovee tije peo
ple are not attributubie to any legisiat*>n or
trend of judicial decision ahVciiu;* the cui
rency.
Here is where the non-seq'uitur comes in.
From my point of view the platform
is not Deruoerstic, but most radically opposed,
to true Democracy. The Indianapolis piat
form suits we, but the only hope for sound
money is iv the election ol McKln<ey, and, in
this State especially, in my opinion, every
vote cast lor IMlnssr and Buc&ner :s iv effect a
vote against MeKinley.
Bryan is snid to have won his nomination by
dnclaring in bulistaure that n crown of thorns
should not be pres-ed upon tlae brow of labor
und that humanity s.'iould not be crucified
upon a cross of Bold. These figures, though,
immediately effective, were not original. It
may well be suggested that, at Wiisday, and in
this land, tbe crucifixion of humanity
is not possible, but if it were, a cross ot gold
would be preferable io a cross of silver. 'Jhe
deeper though!, however, is that neither the
crown of morns, nor the cross would have
passed into history, hud It not beeu lor the
great apostle of a debased currency, Judas
Iscariot, who sold his Lord and master for
thirty pieces of silver. This prototype of mod
ern repudiationists, being pricked with his
conscience, appropriat&ly hanged himself, and
his thirty pieces of silver were used as a legal
tender for the purchase of Aceldama or the
fieid of blood. Henry E. Highton.

The Ship Puritan Sailed
From Hicgo to Folsbm
Street.
A Very Beautiful Spectacle as
She Moved Proudly Down
the Bay.
ALL YANKEE BUT HER FLAG.
Three More Whalers Drop Anchor
Alter On!y a Moderately Sue
cessiul Season.
The people who live on the lofty eleva
tions of San Francisco must have thrown
aside their Sunday reading yesterday
afternoon and rushed to the windows to
see sailing in from the Golden Gate a
spectacle which involuntarily caused the
memory to recall visions of the Flying
Dutchman.
The four-masted British ship Pur
itan, Captain Blanchard, in ballast,
thirty-four days from Hiogo, Japau,
stood in from the ocean and came
up the bay under sail. She was white as
ever fancy or brush painted a ship. As
she was in ballast she floated high and
her white sides gleamed in the sun as st>e
glided up past the docks and dropped
anchor beyond the Folsoru-street wharf.
The Puritan has some remarkable points
about her. She is American in everything
but her Ha.-. She has a Yankee captain,
is manned by a Yankee crew, and several
distinguishable features of her rig are
Yankee notions, but she was built in
Scotland. It i 9 said she is built after the
model of tne sloop Puritan â one of the
successful defenders of the America
cvp â after which Bhe is named. Captaiu
Blanchard ia a nephew of Captain Pendle
ton of the Bhip Henry B. Hyde, which
dropped anchor in port several days ago.
The Puritan reports fair winds and an un
eventful voyage.
The British ship Travencore, Captain
Jones, passed in yesterday forenoon, sixty
eight days from Newcastle, with 3117 tons
of coal consigned to Balfour, Guthrie &
Co. The Travencore is a thoroughly mod
eru craft in all respects. She has one of
the handsomest cabins of any ship in port.
The whaling fleet still continues to drop
in from the north at the rate of two or
three ships a day. The bark Horatio,
Captain Slocum, came in yesterday, four
teen days Irom Fox Islands, witt 2370
pounds of bone, 9 barrels of oil, 8 Dear
skins and 25 foxskins. The bark Charles
W. Morgan. Captain Earl, twenty-eight
days from Okhotsk Sea, had a very fair
season. Slie came la with 850 barrels of
sperm oil. 90 barrels of whaie oil and 1000
pounds of Done. August VI she spoke the
whaling bark California, with 15 operms
and 4 right whales, and August 20 spoke
tbe bark Cape Horn Pigeon, with 30 sperm
and 2 ngnt whales.
Three sailors of the whaling bark
Knowlea, Captain Ogden, which arrived
Saturday night, had a rough experience
in the Arctic- Their toes and the
fingers of one hand were so badly frozen
that they lost them. The Knowles is
twelve days from Fox Islands, with 3449
gallons of sperm oil and 1379 gallons of
whale oil.
The schooner Alexander, nineteen days
from Kodiak, Avery master, arrived in
about 3 o'ciock in the afternoon with a
line catch of furs, consigned to tbe North
American Commercial Company. She ex
perienced vety heavy weather, and had
her headgear carried away.
The steamer Walla Waila tied up at her
wharf about 4:30 in the afternoon, from
Victoria and Puget Sound pi>ints. Octo
ber 30, at 3:30 p. m , in latitude 46 deg. 20
ruin, north and I'tigitu c 124 deg. 55 mm.
west, she passed an English atiip standing
off shore and showing signals N F B N,
and asking to be reported as well.
Some of the sailors of the whaling bark
Orca, which recently arrived from the
north, report only being halt-fed on their
cruise, and claim th it the Japaness stew
ard and cook are to blame.
Vote as you inarched on Saturday and
the State ia safe.
A FALSE ACCUSATION.
To the Voters of the City and Countx
tit San Francisco.
Gentlemen : It having come to our knowledge
thai a false rumor is being spread about the City
that Mr. JOHN WOLF, of Wolf, Wreden & Co..
wholesale liquor deuler.Â«, is and has been fa
voring a high license for l.quor dealers, we
take this opportunity of stating most emphat
ically that Mr. JOii.N WOLF, candidate for the
office of Supervisor for the Sixth Ward of this
City, has at all times since the formation
of the Liquor Dealers' Association been and
now is a prominent and active member of this
Association, and has a. ways been iv favor of
protecting the liquor dealers, wholesale and
retail, In their business and proper conduct
thereof.
He most actively, two years ago aud thlÂ»
year, aJvocated a reasonable and low license
ior the liquor dealers' business to enable deal
ers to profitably carry on their business. Mr.
WOLF has always been and continues to be
the friend of the liquor dealers, and we Confi
dently assert that a;i> and all statements that
have been made or mrty be made tnat Mr.
JOHN WOLF is in favor of ahiith license are
aosoiutey false and without any foundation
whatever.
We nave no doubt that the statemen Is con
cerning Mr. WOLF'B attitude on the question
of hUh license that we above referred to is a
campaign lie, inaugurated and disseminated
by his political opponents.

THE BOSSES' HAND.
An Attempt to JUefeat M.. J. Welch Jr.
for the Senate.
The decent people had congratulated
themselves upon tbe fact that the cam
paign had been clean and free from mud
throwing. This happy condition of
affairs would have continued if men them
selves wero half decent who reserved a
bucketful of yellow slimy matter with
which they propose to soil tho door sill of
their neighbor.
This contemptible condition of political
warfare has been threatened acainst If.
J. Welch Jr., the regular Republican
nominee for the Twenty-third Senatorial
District, in which tbe usual Blimy circular
full of calumny and falsehoods has been
threatened to be issued to the voters, in
order to defeat him at the polls to-morrow.
The cowardly creatures who are behind
this threatened attack have brought the
services of an unfortunate female outcast
into play in the foreground. This and a
trumped-up charge that Mr. Welch was a
candidate for the Assembly from Los
Angeles years before he was of legal ace
are the weapons threatened to be wielued
apainst him in the dodder.
One is false and, as the saying goes, the
otner is ials r. But it matters not.
Ihe voters of the Thirty-ninth and
Thirty-tirst Assembly District will elect
Mr. Welch, notwithstanding what his
enemies may say about him, simply be
cause, if he was as black as paint could
make him, \.e is infinitely better than the
nominees put forth by Rainey. Kelly and
Mahoney. Wflch is a true, ciean-cut Re
publican and as such he will not vote for
Mr. Cator or Sara Rainey's United States
Senator, whoever that roan mi^ht be.
Vote for Republican Senators aud Aa

the votes. A force of watchers has been
organized iuiliciently large to cover all of
the 313 precincts in tbe City. This force
is composed of men who have been well
recommended and will watch the count
both day and nigbt by relays. Arrange
ments have been made with Captain
Harry Morse to take charge of this organ
ized force, and they are now being disci
plined and instructed in their duties.
Each man will bear the authority of the
Registrar to enter and remain in the elec
tion booth. He wih also have tbe author
ity to cause tne arrest of any one found
guilt v of fraud.
Police Judge H. L. Joachimsen, who
has been indorsed for re-election by both
the Republicans and tbe Non-Partisans,
baid to a Call representative yesterday
that this is a peculiar campaign, in that
for the first time all the judges were
obliged to make a personal contest for
their places. Hitherto a candidate for a
judicial position could assume a retire
and rather more dignified manner, es
pecially if be had already served with
credit on the bench, but this year there
were so many nominat ons that it put a
different phase on things. Yet he believes
that good selections will be m de and th.tt
the Republicans will be generally success
ful. His own candidacy, he says, is work
ing out splendidly.
â¢"If there is an overflow of Republican
votes, 1 ' said he, "it may be that every Ke
publican nominee for whatever place will
be carried in. Those who have given the
matter close attention and who are usually
credited with knowing, say Mt-Kinley will
get a majority in the City of 7000 or 8000
votes. It looks as though we were goinc
to aye a largo Republican majority, but!
have been so busy in what I have been ex
pecting to do that I have not had time to
make as accurate estimates as I otherwise
might." ,
Judge Joachimsen hns been filling a
judicial position since 1871. He was first
on the Justices' bench, then Superior
Court Commissioner and then Police
Judge. Talking of the Superior Judges he
sai i he believed Judge Hunt should be
re-elected by a heavy majority.
The ollowing letter speak> for itself on
one character of misrepresentation now
common in local politics:
To the Editor of The Call: A circular has
been sent out to all the soldiers and sailors of
the late war, and to the sons of veterans,giv
ing a selection from all the nominees for
municipal and legislative offices, as being the
ticket indorsed by the joint committee of con
to, (dated veteran soldiers' and sailors' camps
and -.lub.s.
As a member of the joint committee, repre
senting Lclaiid Stanford Camp No. 2, Army
and Navy Republican League, I desire to state
thnt my name has been signed to that circular
without my consent or knowledge, and, further
more, Leiand Stanford Camp No. 2, Army and
Navy Republican League, has indorsed by a
rising vote tho nominees of tho regular Re
publican ticket, headed by C. L. Taylor for
Mayor, which ticket has been recognized by the
Republican B. ate Central Committee and the
Supreme Court oi the State. Yours re-pectiullv,
M. S. Blackburn,
Colonel Commanding Leiand Staulord Camp
No. 2.
The National Republican League mem
bers are requested to meet at 24 Fourth
street at 6:30 p. it. to-day to march to tbe
Oakland ferry for the purpose of going to
the t:rand rally at Oakland.
M. F. Tavlor presided at a meeting of
the Ocean View Republican Club held at
Ocean View last evening. Resolutions
were passed by whicb every member of
t
the club pledged himself to do all in his j
nower to secure the election of Hon. j
Eacene F. Loud to Congress from the
Fifth Con ressional District.
Another resolution was passed by
which every member of the organization
pledged himself to support the repubr
Republican municipal ticket from the
head down. The meeting adjourned with
cheers for McKinlev and Hobart.
Edward I. Wolfe, candidate for State
Senator in the Twenty-firs' Senatorial Dis
trict, is making a strong tight with splen
did prospects. An indorsement of him
from many merchants is now In circula
tion.
All certify to his great ability and high
character. He is prominent in labor cir
cles and is well known as having stumped
the State in past campaigns for his party.
Thomas W. Chandler's risrht in the
Twent3'-titfh is equally safe. He has made
a orave canvass anil has made friends
everywhere because He is known as an
lionest and able man.
Trie following circular-letter shows the
infamy to which the enemies of clean
politics sometimes resort:
Ban Francisco, Oct. 30, 1896.
Editor Call: In view of certain statements
published in the Chronicle and Examiner, to
the effect that the clerks working at the Regis
tration Office on behaif of the Republican party,
for ihe purpose of preventing und detecting
ir.een.l registration, are claiming that tha Re
publican. County Committee, of which Grove
P. Ayers, J. M. Chretien and James A.va Watt
are members, is indebted to them for their ser
vices, we, the undersigned said clerks,-de
sire to state that we offered our services volun
tarily, as good Republicans, for the welfare of
the party, and that no promises wero made by
John 1). Spreckels or any other person that \vu
were to be paid lor such services.
We furthermore declare that the ten clerk 3
who have made and who are now making su'/h^
a claim and who are now assisliug Kelly and
Mahoney in attempting to destroy the Repub

Republicans, but have taken part in politics
for whatever there is iv it.

Tbe following letter to Mi?s Susan B.
Anthony is comforting the ladies of the
Republican Central Committee. It gives
a tine idea of woman's rights as seen in
Wyoming, and is from the wife of Senator
Joseph M. Casey ot Cheyenne:
Cheyenne, Wyo., Oct. 28, 1896.
Pear 3fiss Amthoay: Your letter came here
during my absence, which accounts for my de
lay in answering it. I heartily sympathize
with you in your efl'orts to secure to women
the right to vote, through an amendment to
the constitution oi the State of California. As
you are aware, I have heretofore said and
written much on the suffrage question in this
State, but another word may not be out of
place at this time.
The women of Wyoming generslly vote. The
voters are not confined to a degraded class.
The women of home- , the cultured wife, sister
and daughter not only vote but attend the
primaries. Ido not find that women voting
materially changes the powers of the political
parties, but in the selection of candidate* and
iv the making of nominations the expected
vote oi the women becomes, as ii should, aa
important factor.
Women vote, not because tliey have the
-ight, but for the same reason that men vote,
niimely, thnt they have an intense interest,
moral and financial, in the results of the elec
tions. The elt'C.ious i.i Wyoming are quiet
and orderly. No woman encounters or ex
pects to encounter disorderly conduct at the
polling booths in this Siaie. The best women
of the State go to the primaries. These are
not held ia saloons or in the vicinity of drink
ing pluces. 1 have not known in one instance
of a woman being insulted at a primary or at
an election since she has had the right to vote
in Wyoming.
Women voting no longer excite comment.
No one now uve.i doubis the expediency of her
exercising the right to vole and bo:d office.
She exerc.scs her political rights as wisely and
as well as thÂ£ best of the men. Her influence
is and can only be for that whicn is beat in
American politics.
If tfe Caliiornia people should amend the
constitution of the S ate, civinu women the
right to vote at the Â«pproaching election, they,
I know, would never have reason to regret
their action. I am, with much rcpect. faith
fully yours, Josephine Caeey.
Judge Coffes-'s strong indorsement of
Carroll Cook for Superior Judge has
greatly aided that superb lawyer's chances,
und his election is now a foregone con
clusion.
Judge A. B. Treadwell, candidate for
Police Judge, is an honorary member of
the Typographical Union, and it is said
he will get nearly all the printers' votes.
Judee Sanderson, though a Democrat, is
making a strong tignt for Superior Judge.
His friends say the greatest opposition
comes from the Noe heirs and their fol
lowers.

Edward A. Day of Newark, N. J., reached the
City yesterday on his wheel, having made the
distance, 3677 miles, in exactly sixty-four days.
This is an average of nearly fifty-eight miles
jer day, though the young man gives no out
ward evidence of the long journey. Day says
be undertook the trip merely for the pleasure
there was in it. He anticipated some trouble
in crossing the desert, but the aikall was
parked hard and firm, rendering riding a
pleasure. Youug Day expects to return to
Newark by rail.

While families were downtown Sat; r
day afternoon viewing the* great .Hepubli

Among t lie cases reported at police head
quarters was that of Frederick P. Stone,
Stone, president of the Bancroft-Whitney
Company. He lives at 1030 Dolores street.
His family locked up the house Saturday
and joined the throng on Market street
that viewed the parade.
When they returned in the evening the
honse had ail the appearance of having
been visited by a cyclone. The glass in
the doors had been broken, ne door had
been forced off its hinges, trunks had been
broken opeu and the house practically
looted. '
The burglars had gone throueh the
garden to tne rear of the house after ring
ins the bell in the front and satisfying
themselves that no one was in tne house.
There is a door leading to a recess before
reaching the kitchen door. Tue former
was left open to enable the milkman in
making his afternoon delivery to leave it
there. The kitchen door has glass panels,
and the burglars after entering the recess
cut the glass out of the panel nearest the
knob of the door, which enabled them to
unbolt the door.
After getting access to the kite en they
found that tae door leading from the
kitchen to the dining-room was locked.
They tried to open it, but failed. In the
wall there is a hole large enough for a
small man to crawl through, which is used
for passing dishes from the kitchen to the
liin.ng â¢ room. The burglars crawled
through this hole into the dining-room,
and then made their way into the library.
From the library there is a door leading
into the drawing-room, which was locked.
Not to be balkeJ in their search for plun

organisations which have sprung up uu
der the direction of tne Woman's Chris

been growing at an encouraging rate. The
purpose of the bands is educational and is
In no way sectarian, Mrs. North, the State

physiological results following alcoholic
indulgence.
It has been estimated that over Â£50,000
worth of me 'ieine is annually distributed

.M'KINLEY TO BE HONORED.
No Frivolity or Levity Will Be Seen
in Monday's Republican Dem
onstration.
Oakland Officb San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Nov. 1. j
Tho Bryan Populists and Democrats of
Alameda County closed their campaign
of ridicule and subterfuge last night, and
the end was in perfect harmony with the
policy they have maintained throughout
the past t ree months.
The final parade was a very appropriate
climax to such a campaign.
One remark of Macaulay's, referring to
Voltaire, sums up as no other words could
do the Bryan campaign in this county.
"Voltaire could not build," said Macau
ley; "he could onJy pull down."
Now the intelligent people are wonder
ing what are the principle*? of Bryanism.
They have gone to the Tabernacle night
after nieht, and have heard every Repub
lican doctrine trampled under foot; they
have heard every Republican sneered at;
they have seen every prominent man
in the country ridiculed and pilloried;
they have seen a few men march on
Broadway, Rearing badges on which was
printed a Police Gazette caricature that
the camion said was intended for Mark
Hanna; they have heard the men who
fonr years ago shouted themselves red in
the face for Cleveland and gold declare
that they were as wrong then as they de
clare the followers of McKinley are to
day; they have been witnesses to ail this
for three months, and now all is over, and
not a single truth or principle has been
brought forward as a substitute for all
these great evils as seen through ever
changing eyes.
The men who have led the campaign of
Popocracy in this county are men who
have been repudiated at the polla time
and time again. Many of them are Cleve
land office-holders and are employed at
the Mint, the Custom-house or in post
offices. There has been no alliance be
tween the Democrats and Populists in
this county; the alliance has been between
Cleveland office-holders who are anxious
to succeed themselves and Bryanites.
Many votes were lost by the excess of
last night's indecencies. Thomas B. Reed
of Idaine is a man who enjoys the respect
of State of Maine associations wherever
he goes, and an insult to Heed is an insult
to his State. Many honest Maine people
saw^ with shame the paltry efforts last
night to cast odium on the great states
man because he is honest and true to his
convictions.
''Reed, the slave of Huntington," is
a very consistent motto to haul
in a parade behind Warren B. English,
Dr. Woolsey and G. W. Baker, a Southern
Pacific attorney. It must have inspired
disgust in intelligent people who saw it.
The incident was not lost to the people
from Maine, who still have some of that
respect which is an element of New Eng
land life.
Another edifying spectacle was a revolt
ing impersonation of the Police Gazette
idea of Mark Hanna in a gold-colored suit
bidding people to the Tabernacle where
such stanch Bryanites as Postmaster
White, Postmaster Ole Vincent of Berke
ley, Surveyor of Port English, whose res
lsnation appears to have been lost, R. M.
Fitzgerald, Dacgett's Alameda County
lieutenant, and several other employes of
the Mint and Custom-house were leading
Hehts. Such are a few of the facts con
nected with the campaign of Bryanism
just closed in this county.
In stranee contrast with the programme
of ridicule just referred to is the campaign
of those who are in favor of protection,
Sound money and decency. Not a single
transparency has been seen on the street
that couid be even willfully construed
into a personality reflecting on their pc
litieal opponents. Probably in no other
county in the. State has a Republican cam
paign ever been conducted with more
decorum and freedom from trivialities.
This' - has not been a necessity forced on
the managers of the campaign because of
the inviolable consistency of their oppo
nentfc Had ever legitimate sarcasm been
sought tbe material was at hand.
Senator Stewart's gold mortgages on
record in this county and some of his ut
terances regarding the gold mortgages
held by other people; the peculiarities of
Cleveland oQce-bolders hitchine their fu
ture ambitions to the tail of Bryan's kite;
the utterances of such leading Bryanites
as T. H. B. Rosenberg, J. W. Dutton, T.
V. Cator and J. A. Jones; ail these, had
the anoe been on the other foot, would
have been eagerly grasped and made sub
jects of ridicule, and possibly with good
effect. But not one of them has been
taken up by the Republican managers.
They have not prosecuted a Voltairean
campaign of pulling down. Theirs has
been a process of building. No disap
pointed railroad employes have been
hired to air their grievances and work off
personal grudges under the shadows of
Bryanism. No wreck marks the track of
the Republican campaign, but instead
there has been built up in Alamedy
County a structure of principle and in
tegrity and intelligence and decency such
as was never seen here before.
" If any proof of the respectability and
solidity of tbe Republican campaign is
r.eedea, a glance at the formation of the
great parade" to-morrow might well snpply
â¢ it. ' N.O caricature of Bryan, Teller. Jones
"or Altgeld; no attempt at wrecking; no
Voltairism; no adoption of caricature to
conceal the utter absence of legitimacy.
The greal pulses of industry and com
merce will throb in to-morrow night's
. parade. â  Serious men, to whom the clank
Aof the anvil ox the thud of the hammer ia
Itbe sweetest of music, because every
\6ound is a connecting link between home
Â»':d happiness, will be in line. Men who
have worked their way to the topmost
Â° runp of-tbe ladder of success by industry
and thrift will be there also. Among the
latter are Johnny Brition, who sliove.ed
clinkers out of the gas company's boiler
hres twenty years ago and who is now
general manager of that great concern.
J. West Martin is also ia this gioup,
who in 1852 started to cultivate a piece of
the Santa Rita Rancho and who is now
regent of the State "University and a pros
perous man. Both these men were Demo
crats until their varty deserted its prin
ciples a few months ago. Railroad men
of intelligence about whose "coercion" so
much has been said, will be there.. Every
branch of trade will be represented, and
indeed every element that has a part in
the construction and maintenance of a
commonwealth and progress and integ
rity will march through the streets of
Oakland to-morrow nipht, and he whose
ears are not stopped and whose eyes are
not blinded cannot help but read the
lesson aright.
As Bbown by the last Republican pri
mary, a majority of all the votes in the
county are with that party. This fact,
however, though significant should not
be permitted to cause any relaxation of
effort to make the result of Tuesday's
word doubly sure. Although the great
National issue towers over purely local
contests it is necessary to the maintenance
of a strictly party government that local
officers are in harmony with higher ones.
In this county there is every indication
that the Republican nominee for the few
offices to be filled will be successful. With
such a keen and clear-cut National issue
on the ballot it is more than likely that
party feeling will dominate throughout.
Congressman Hilborn is certainly no
less popular than he was two years aco.
W. E. Green and Samuel P. Hall are men
whose ability to serve as Superior Judges
cannot be questioned. J. W. Stetson and
J. J. Allen are the nominees for Justices of
the Peace, and each is running very
strongly. Fred V. Wood, who was one
of the successful Republican candidates
for Justice two years ago, is trying to suc
ceed himself as an independent candidate.
Considerable opposition exists in the Con
gressional districts, but there is no reason
to suppose that the Republican nominees
will not lead the list. The Assembly nom-
4 nees are F. W. Leavitt, H. D. North, H.

The demand for more papers began be
fore 8 o'clock in the mornins: and con
tinued throughout the . ilay and night,
orders being received from all those parts
of the State in which they had been dis
tributed.
The newsboys on the streetsâ and there

were wild with excitement.
They were ready to exchange two of the
other morning papers for one Call. It was
purely a business proposition with them â¢
they needed Calls to supply the demand!
Edition after edition was struck off and
Distributed and still the demand for more
papers continued.
The eagerness with which the public

the Different Catholic
Churches.
Sermons Bearing on the Feast
Preached From Many
Pulpits.
THE EPISCOPAL CEREMONIES.
Service for the Dead at Cypress Lawn
Cemeteryâ Bishop Nichols
Officiated.
The Feast of All Saints was commem
orated yesterday in the Catholic churches
of this City with appropriate services, be
ginning with hi^h mas? in the morning
and closing with solemn vespers at night.
It is one of the createst festivals of
tbe year in the Catholic Church,
and all faithful followers enter into the
spirit of its observance with fervor ana
sincerity of purpose. For on this day is
celebrated the festival of all the saints in
heaven, myriads of whom are unknown in
the church calendar.
At St. Mary's Cathedral a solemn high
mass was celebrated at 10:30 a. m., when
the church was crowded to the doors. The
altars were beautifully decorated with
flowers of the season and brilliant in the
glow of burning candles. The Rev. Ed
ward P. Dempsey preached a sermon ap
propriate to the feast, and ttie music w&s
specially selected, .Professor Harrison di
recting an augmented choir, while accom
panying the singers on the grand organ.
The Calvarlan Society held its annual
meeting and commemorative services at
S o'clock in the afternoon in the cathedral.
The sermon to the society was delivered
by the Rev. J. J. Prendergast, V. G. Rev.
Joseph F. Byrne, director of the society,
conducted the devotion of the Way of the
Cross, in which the congregation followed
the passion of Christ through its various
scenes to Calvary. After this was over the
congregation sang in English the "Stabat
Mater," and benediction of the blessed
sacrament was held in concluding the im
pressive serv cc.
Solemn vespers were snng in the even
ing and a large congregation was present.
Rev. Joseph F. Byrne delivered a sermon
after vespers.
The church of the Faalist Fathers on
California street (old St. Mary's) was so
crowded at the 11 a. m. mass that many
worsnipert had to stand in the aisles.
High mass was celebrated by KÂ«v. Charles
J. Powers, C. 8. P., who arrived here
recently from New York. The main altar
was a blaze of candles and electric lights,
and between the candelabra were huge
bunches of yellow and white chrysanthe
mums that made a very effective winter
decoration.
Under the direction of Miss Marie Gior
giani Haydn's seventh mass in G was ren
dcre i by the choir, composed of the fol
lowing singers: Miss Lottie Crawford,
Miss Ailcla Rottanzi, Miss L. Devine and
Miss K. Duffy, sopranos; Mrs. Stefany,
Miss Agnes Bergin, Mi-s Helen Ford ana
Miss Kottanzi, contraltos; J. Desmond,
Ben Seiberlich and Dr. Bolero, tenors;
William Gordon, William O'Brien and
Dr. R ttanzi, bassos. The music was
Buperior to the usual Sunday renderings
by ths choir, which is distinguished for
its excellence.
The Rev. Father Clarke. C. 8. P.,
preached on All Saints, taking his text
jrom tbe gospel of the day: "Blessed are
ye when men shall revile you, and perse
cute you, and speak all manner of evil
things against you." He said that while
there were many saints on the calendar,
still the number of saints in heaven, who
are unknown to people on earth, was
almost countless. These saints had se
cured their crowns of eternal happiness
by leading good lives. On this day their
feast was commemorated. They who are
persecuted and oppressed in this life are
among the blessed whose reward lies be
yond the grave. The most downtrodden,
oppressed nation was Ireland, but if that
nation would change its faith instantly
the oppression would cease. Why is it
that God allows it to be persecuted and
reviled? He allows it to suffer, but will
reward it in the world to come. Job was
afllicied, reviled and persecuted, yet he is
one of the brightest saints in heaven.
Father Clarke showed that Christians
should be true as adamant, should lead
virtuous, pure and upright lives, and then
they would gain their reward with the
saints above.
Solemn high mass was sung at St Ig
natius Cnurch in the morning by Rev.
Father Demasiui, S. J., assisted by Rev.
Father Tardella, 8. J., as deacon and
Rev. Father Hickey, S. J., as subdeacon.
Rev. Henry Woods, 8. J., preached an elo
quent sermon bearing on the aay. St. Ig
natius male choir rendered a beautiful
mass for the feast.
In the evening solemn vespers were
sung and a sermon was preached on the
"Souls in Purgatory" by Rev. Father
Calzia, 8. J. The service concluded with
benediction of the blessed sacrament.
Â»
SERVICE FOR THE DEAD
Beautiful and Pathetic Ceremonies
at Cypress Lawn.
The festival of All Saints was celebrated
at the chapel of Cypress Lawn Cemetery.
The service was conducted by Bishop
Nichols, assisted by Rev. Mr. Kip of the
Mission of the Good Samaritan and Rey.
Mr. Lincoln of the theological seminary of
San Mateo.
The beautiful chapel was profusely orna
mented with ferns and palms and the
altar was embellished with a large cross
composed of tbe choicest flowers. An
audience filling the chapel was present.
Every one attending seemed to have been
drawn to the service by the memories of
friends who were buried in the inclosure,
and there were but few whose eyes were
not dimmed by tears.
Holy communion was administered by
tbe bishop, who preached a remarkable
sermon on tbe lessons of the daw
The "Communion of Saints was the
theme, and upon this subject the Bishop
drew comforting pictures of the triumph
and faith of the church in immortality
and the certainty of again communing
with the lost and loved in the paradise
which is promised as the reward of those
who love the Lord.
The sermon was lull of cheer to the af
flicted and was a beautiful exposition of
Christian hope. A lar^e number of per
sons of various shades of belief partici
pated in the communion.
The music was especially adapted for
the pathetic and beautiful ceremony and
rendered by the vested choir of the Good
Samaritan Mission, under the direction of
Miss Brown, the organist.
Cotton cloth was first made in India
About the year 450 B. C. Herodotus spoke
of this famous fabric from the trees of
India which bore as their fruit fleeces sur
passing in beauty and delicacy those of

ntroduced into Greece and Rome.

SUFFRAGISTS HOPEFUL
The State Has Been Thoroughly
Stumped by Able
Speakers.
The result of the most thorough and
vigorous campaign ever conducted by the
woman suffragists will be known on
Tuesday. This campaign has been car
ried on by the employment of political
methods, a deviation from the routine of
all previous campaigns.
Each State has been divided into assem
bly districts ami again into electional pre
cincts. The precincts have been thor
oughly canvassed, and every voter that
could possibly be seen has been inter
viewed, and the result has been auch that
the suffragists declare they will win hands
down, if the men will stand by their
promises and pledges.
In the mountain towns which oould not
be reached by special speakers the wore
has been taken hold of by local women,
and every town that boasts 200 inhabitants
has been thoroughly aroused to the cause.
Hundreds of thousands of suffrage leaflets
or campaign literature, containing argu
ments in favor of suffrage, have been dis
tributed through the States.
Susan B. Anthony, accompanied by her
private secretary, Emma D. Sweet, ar
rived in this City from New York on the
15th of March, expecting to remain in the
State four months, but tney were so en
couraged by the adoption of their plank
by the Republican party that they de
cided to await the result of the election.
Although the cause has always had the
support of the religious and country
papers, for the first time in its history a
metropolitan journal has come out and
declared for them, arousing the people
and making sentiment. Mrs. Carrie
Chapman Catt and Rev. Anna H. Shaw
have devoted the noon hour the last two
weeks addressing the employes of the
different factories, foundries and mills,
and have been assisted by the proprietors
in fathering the men together.
The speakers have been listened to with
the greatest respect and attention, despite
the fact that many small boys are em
ployed in the factories, and although not
evincing as much interest as their elders
they refrained from the usual joshing in
dulged in by them. An occasional man
would venture the remark that a woman's
place was at home with the babies, but he
was always quickly squelched.
Last Friday at the Pacific Rolling-mills
the men stood for an hour in the yard
unprotected from the rain and listened to
Mrs. Catt, who addressed them from the
doorway.
After these meetings the men, almost
without exception, would signify their in
tention of voting for the amendment.
The suffragists will take no active part
at the polio on eleciion day, but there will
be a score of anxious women awaiting the
result in their headquarters in the Em
porium building.
Mrs. Sweet doesn't think there will be
any great demonstration should the suf
fragists win. She says they will do as the
women of Colorado did when they gained
tbe ballot â organize study clubs to inform
themselves on economic questions.

and took up the matter of .pledging the
Legislative candidates in the behalf of the
labor cause.
Last Friday Secretary Lathrop notified
every nominee of every party in the Sen
atorial and Assembly districts of this
City that if he desired the suffrage of the
trade organizations represented by the
convention he must pledge himself to
work for certain laws compiled by the
Labor Commissioner. The proposed en
actments were mentioned under the fol
lowing heads:
Eight hours; bakeries; bond protecting
labor on public works; creating labor bureau;
regulating; employment offices; per diem on
public work; bakers' hours; time check sys
tem; identity of prison-made goods; remit
ting advanced cost of suit; collusion with em
ployment agents; employment of citizens;
boiler inspectors; providing for payment of
employes; costs of workmen's lawsuits; to
pass a mechanics' Hen law; recommending
the repeal of tbepolltax; a law to fix Stuto
Labor day the first Monday in September; to
furnish the primary and grammar grades of
the public scnools textboots free to all pupils.
After President James Rose had called
the convention to order he stated about
fifty-seven out of the 109 nominees had
signed the pledge, although all had been
notified.
Upon motion the following resolution
was adopted:
Whereas, Ihe following candidates for the
Legislature have pledged themselves in case of
their election to work and vote for the labor
laws adopted by tbe California Labor Conven
tion, therefore, be it
Resolved, That we, the California Labor Con
vention, indorse said candidates and pledge
ourselves to vote and work for their election;

and good government to assist by their votes

Forty-second; A. M. Armstrong, F. Lundquist,
Charles Schinkle, Forty-third; E. S. Ryan, G.
Nathan. Forty-fourth; F. Berg, Felix B. Mul
grew, Forty-fifth.
A warm discussion then arose over the
candidates wno had not signed the pledge.
Delegate P. H. McCarthy moved that the
list be now ciosed and the labor organiza
tions take cognizance of tbe fact that cer
tain nominees refused to be pledged to the
cause of labor. G. Lafayette advocated
that the opportunity be given them till
noon to-day, as it was desired to get as
many names on tbe list as possible. Dele
gate McArthur stated that it was too late
in the campaign to begin an active can
vass against the candidates who had failed
to bring in their names. He also stated
that candidates which they had refused to
indorse had been successful and pledges
from all was what they wanted. They
wanted the new office- hoider on record
even if he broke his pledge.
The time was extended until to-day.
The following resolution wai adopted :
Retolved, That we urge his Excellency Gov
ernor Budd to recommend the bills adopted
by the California Labor Convention in hit
message to the forthcoming Legislature and
sign them when they are passed, and thereby
earn tbe further and more lasting gratitude of
the wage-workers of this State.
Retolved, That these resolutions be spread
upon the minutes of this convention and a
copy be sent to the Governor and that they be
given to the press for publication.

Personal Property Tax as
a Lien Against
Realty.
A Fifty-Vara Lot on Turk
Street Sells for
$235,000.
REVIEW OF THE RECORDS.
A Comparison of the Amount oi
Build. ng for the First Ten Months
ot the Tear Since 1890
A question agitated among real-estate brok
ers is that of adopting; some system of legisla
tion to correct the personal property tÂ«x evil
so that the lien of the tax may be confined to
the place of the resident instead of, as at
present, existing as a lien upon all the prop
erty of all persons of the same name.
Real-estate agents in the sale of property are
often put to considerable trouble to clear the
title of iand in a sale against which may ap
pear a number of liens for personal property
taxes for persons of the same name as that
in which the property they may be sell
ing stands on the records. It is the intention
of the brokers, if posslbie, to pass a law at the
next Legislature confining such lien upon
those particular premises in which the owner
may have resided at the time bis personal
property tax became delinquent.
The most important transfer of city realty
for some time past Â«as the sale last week to

A LAST APPEAL.
Friend* of Henry C. Dibble Sound a
final Call to Duty.
The Republicans of the Forty- first Dis
trict are leaving nothing undone that will
in any way help the candidacy of their
chosen man, Henry C. Dibble. They have
worked hard ail ihrough tbe campaign,
and now, at its close, tney have spread the
following manly and torcible appeal for
Dibble and his comrades on 'the ticket of
prosperity.
BEPT3LICAN VOTERB,Â»ATTENTION.
Pan Francisco Oct. 29, 1896.
To the Republican voters Forty-first Assembly
The iiiidersigned, who feel a deep interest in
the success of the Republican party, desire to
call attention to the great importance of vot
ing lor the Republican candidate for Congress
and of fleeting a Republican to the Assembly
irom this district.
It it. not nectssisry to repeat the obvious ar
gument that Major V.iKr.n.y. whose election
to the Presidency is now assured, will be
powerless to restore confidence and prosperity
to the country unless he is supported' by a
Repi b ican Congress. Every sincere and Joyai
Republican of the tlistrict should, therefore,
vote for Eugene F Loud, the Republican can
didate for the Fifth Congressional district.
Scarcely less important is the election of a
Republican to the Assembly. It would be the
height of political folly to allow the Dem
ocratic-Populist fusionists to gain control of
the Legislature. Above all, it is necessary,
from a party standpoint, as already said, to
secure a Republican majurity in the joint As
sembly, iii order to choose a Republican to the
Senate of the United Staves. The fusiouists
have committed themselves to Mr. Cator, the
Populist leader, ana the failure to elect the
Republican candidate in this district, since
the contest is so close, may result in the elec
tion of Mr. Cator to the Senate.
We thereiore earnestly urge every Repub
lican voter in the dis'rict to support Henry C,
Dibble, who is tho regular Republican candi
date for the Assembly.
There ought to be no doubt of Judge Dib
ble's election, nor would there be, as between j
him and the Democrat. c-Populist candidate
or candidates, if it were not lor the fact that
another candidate claiming Republican af
filiation is on the official ballot. But he whs j
not regularly nominated. He is not the can
didate of the local party organization which
has been sustained by tne Republican State
Central Committee and by the Supreme Court
of the State, and he ought not to be supported
by any Republican who is loyal to the party.
The o-ily effect, if not the only object, of his
candidacy is to endanger the election of Judge
Dibble, the regular candidate.
No intelligent Republican should be misled
by the circumstance that the so-called Xon-
Partisan convention has i-ut forward a candi
date. There were no Republican delegates
from this district in that body, and it is now
well known that the legislative indorsements
were manipulated by Democratic and Populist
politicians with a view to the defeat of the
Republican candidates.
\\e therefore urge every loyal Republican
elector of the district to vote for Henry C. Dib
ble for the Assembly. Look to the general
ticket. Vote first for nine Ropub'.ican electors,
then for Eugene F. Loud, the Republican can
didate for Congress, then lor llenry C. Dibble,
whose name next avpeÃrs an-i heads the list of
candidates for the Assembly.

chief of tbe military forces in California,
is decidedly caustic. The letter is uated
Stockton, October 3L Tbe writer refers to
his departure from the path trodden by his
own party to support Governor Budd for
Congressman ana Governor, and tenders
his party friends an apology for 6uch de
viation. Sperry then says:
I have held lor the past tWo years a position
on your persona', staff You also inherited
me from Governor H. H. Maikham as a Yo
semite Commissioner. I forwarded to you
to-day my resignation for both of tnese r-.fl&ces.
Mr reasons therefor are as follows: I do not
wish to be connected In an official capacity
with you after your speech, delivered in San
Francisco Mondgv evening last, when you de
liberately charged employers with bribery and
coercion and employes with corrupting and
cowardice (for an employv must necssari'y be
cowardly who would be coerced). You must
remember, s>ir, Uiat ihese are the people who
supi.orted you in 1894 and made it pi.ssible
ior you to becom* ti ,vernor ol Caliiornia.
Hnve you so little regard for the intelligence
of American labor as io believe tnat in the
short period of two years they have become
eligible to the "jackals parade," to quote your
own words?
In closing Colonel Speri-y thus writes to
the commander-in-chiet:
I consider your remarks on the date afore
said intempeiate, demagogic Â»nd fais>e and
unbecoming ihe dignity and honor which
your high office imposes "upon you. I believe
that the people will repudiate your insults at
the polls on Tuesday uext.
Colonel Sperry was commissioned on the
staff o; Governor Budd January 19, 18!<5.
He had previously served on the staff o:
Major-General D monri, division com
mander of ihe National Guard. He is
known as an active and capable officer
and an earnest supporter of the Guard.
The San Francisco Journal of Com
merce makes the statement that Lieu
tenant-Colonel Thomas A. Nerney, in
spector of rifle practice on the staff of
Major-General James, division commander
of the National Guard, is the agent of an
Eastern uniform manufactory and has
been touring the State obtaining orders
for military uniforms and sending them
back East to be filled by the firm of Peiti
bone & Co. of Cincinnati. It is said that
no contract has been too large or too small
for the firm to take. As an instance it is
cited that the uniforms of the First Regi
ment band were made by Pettibone ct Co.,
nnd recently an order was sent to them
for a pair of epaulets to grace the shoul
ders of an officer.
The next Legislature will be asked to
make an appropriation to supply the
National Guard with clothing. There is
an active sentiment in favor of patron
izing home industries in this equipment.
The right of Colonel Nerney to represent
an Eastern house cannot be questioned,
but the point is raised that hi> position as
an officer on General James' staff enables
him to travel at certain seasons of the
year at tlie expense of the State.
Lieutenant-Colonel Philip L. Bush, staff
of Governor Budd, has return d to the
City, havinc been on a surveying expedi
tion for four months.
Major W. W. Douglas, signal officer,
staff of General M. W. Muiler, Third
Brigade, was in San Francisco yesterday.
W. L. Elliott, lieutenant and adjutant
of the Nava! Battalion, presided at an
election for lieutenant Jr. Gr. in the sec
ond division la*t Tuesday. A. H. Elliott,
senior ensign, was elected to the vacant
position and T. S. Harloe, chief petty
effi er, was chosen for the vacant ensign
ship. Mr. Hurioe is one of the charter
members of the division.
First Brigade.
BAN BKRXARDIXO, Cat... Oct. 28.â
The notice published in to-day's press dis
patches that an emergency call would
soon be issued calling ou* the entire guard
of the State created quite a ripple of ex
citement around Company X, Seventh In
fantry headquarters, and was the sole
topic discu&si d by the regular Habitues of
the armory this evening. The majority of
the men are of the opinion that micd a
call would be very generally responded to.
There is no doubt, however, that it would
be a great hardship upon some of the men
to leave tneir positions, even for t c short
time they would be ordered out, and it
might result in serious loss to some of
them.
A team composed of members of Com
pany X accepted a challenge from a team
from Company G of Kedlands for a shoot
inu' matcn. The teams met at the Red
lands range las: week and Company X
came home with the banner and 26 points
to their credit.
Nearly every man on Company X's roll
turned out at drill on Monday evening
and every man attended strictly to busi
ness. The result was one of the best drills
j .he comnanv has had for some time.
It is understood that Fir<-t Lieutenant
i Welton of Company G, Redlamis, will
I soon tender his resignation to the Com-
I niat'der-in-Cai<;f. If Lieutenant Welton
leave* the service the S ate will lose one
of its most faithful < ificers nnd Comnany
G an earnest and efficient soldier and gen
tleman.
The following promotions nore an
-1 nounced on orders this week: Private A.
B. Gazzolo to bf Quartermns-tpr Sergeant;
Private W. G. Bodfc'.n to be Sergeant.
Sergeant Gazzo o has been Acting Quar
termaster since the departure of Sergeant
Guihrie, now of Company H of t c Sixth
Infantry, and has tilled the position in a
very satisfactory manner. Sergeant Bod
kin has been one oi ths best non-com nn<
sioneiis in the company, and his promo
tion meets the bearty approval of every
man in the command.
Second Brigade.
At the regimental armory of the First
Infantry, on PAge street, and at the
armory of the "National-," on Ellisstreet,
there is a deal of talk about the expected
"emergency call." It is said that the
First Regiment could tnrn out for duty on
three hour*' notice. In expectation of
the call blankets have been rolled and
equipments necessary for a march placed
within handy reach.
T c regimental examining board of the
First Infantry recommends the following
men for promotion:
Corooral George W. Bwan, Company D,
and Private Albert H. Mowbray. Cadet
Company, to be sergean s. Privates
James H. McKnight, George F. Law ton,
Thomas \V. Hollis, Company C; Charles
H. La Berge. William D. Flinn, Louis H.
Antbes, Company D; A. H. Breckwoldt,
K. J. Robinson, Company L; Leonard B.
Simon, Shirley C. Walker, Charles G.
Bartlett, Ashley R. Faull, Monroe Dtutsch,
John Jurdine and Walter J. Buttgenbach,
Cadet Company, to bf corporals.
Regimental order No. 19, dated October
27, 1896, announces the discharge of nixty
enlisted men. The causes given are re
moval and expiration of term of service.
It is said by the men at the armories
that the men are not re-enlisting as they
formerly did. The cause of the discontent
is said to be lack of proper equipment.
The twelve-company regiment 01 the Na
tional Guam stationed in San Francisco
should have its lull complement of men.
Tnere bas been a preat deal of talk about
putting the guard in first-class shape, but
the high officers who are responsible for
the present condition of the service seem
to be slow and indifferent.
Company tf of ths First Infantry gave a
ball last Thurs.lay evening at the Ellis
street armory. Foil dresb uniform was
worn. The company's room was hand
somely decorated by the ladies.
The Signal Corps of the Second Brigade
had regular drill Saturday evening last.
Companies F and X will drill next Tues
day night.
The baseball team of Company F, First
Infantry, recently defeated a team be
longing to Company F. Fifth Infantry.
Third Brigade.
WOODLAND. Cal., Oct. 30.â Items of
interc-t in military circles are very scarce
this w>ek, owing to tbe excitement pre
ceding the election. The local company
he!d a business meeting Wednesday night
and considerable business was transacted.
The company will give a grand entertain
ment some time during the month of No
vember for the purpose of raising funds to
purchase a flag and flagpole to be placed
upon the armory. As the members are
very enthusiastic and as the company has
talent oi the highest order in its ranks the
public may look for an entertainment
above the general run of such things.
The second social of the winter series
took place last eveninp, and to say it waÂ»
a success bat mildly expresses the com
pliments that have been showered upon
the company to-day. A series of ladies'
uight entertainments are to be started in
the near suture.
These are to be strictly first class in. all
respects, and will tend to elevate tne social
qualities of tne company as. well as lo
create an impression on the outside that
Company Fis wha it says it isâ the lead-
NW society organization of Woodland.
The company would be very glad to
weicome militiamen from all parts of the
Slate to ihese entertainments, especially
the higher officials of the N. G. C. Wood
land is nosed for its entertaining qualities,
and Company f is not lacking in that
very essential part that goes to make local
social gatherings so popular.
After election the company expects to
accomplish many things in the, way of
drill ing and all things connected with
soldier life.

DOINGS IN HORSEDOM.
Dan Honig, the Bt. I.nuis Turfman,
Arrives With Hla Stable of
Racers â Notes.
As the racing season in the East draw*
to a close the pilgrimage of horsemen and
bookmakers to California increases.
Among the arrivals at Ingletide track yes
terday was the jolly St. Louis owner, Dan
Honig, accompanied by his brother-in
law, big '"Bill" Henry, who is manager of
the stable. Mr. Honig brought the crack
chestnut Magnet; tbe two-year-old plater
Zamar 11, who won over a dozen races at
St. Louis; Lizz.e H, of Garner and silken
cord fume; Battledore; Tom Eimore, a
very useful horse, and Rosella, a filly,
who formerly carried the Morris all-scar
let colors. The horses arrived In good
condition, but very weary. "Peach"
Honii;, the owner's son, will do the train
ing.
The stable's jockeys are Charley Mc-
Donald, who can ride at 108 pounds, and a
79-puund lad named Rector, who gives
promise of becoming a good rider. Mr.
Honig >& <i that he had a large specially
arranged box stall made for Magnet in the
car, but the b:g chestnut stood up during
the entire journey. Mr Honig brought
Sweet Favordale, owned by Burns &
Watern<>use, out with his siring.
In the same car with the Honig horse
came four owned r>y Tom X.ley, the best
of which is the sprinter George F. Smith.
Walter M. Lemore. t. c Texas norseman,
will arrive at Inglpside fjom El Paso to
morrow with a stable of five norses. The
Texan was here two years aeo with Co
checo, Brownwood, Boston Boy and Rube
Burrows, each of wnicn earned numerous
Winning brackets.
"Billy McGrane is also due h<*re to
morrow from St. Louis with a string of
fifteen. McGrane is well known to the
horse world as the owner of the good colt
of tno years a. r o, Frank X,
Harry Huffman, partner in the book
making business with Frank Eckert, got
in town from Chicago yesterduy. He was
accompanied by his brother Jess.
The recent rains caused several wash
outs in tbe new Oakland track which are
now being tilled in by workmen. Had
the downpour been more severe much
damage to the course would have resulted,
it is said.
It is understood the California Jockey
Club bas concluded tn allow Wi lie Martin
to ride at Oakland. Riley Grannan's turn
will probably cÂ«me next, and that un
popular ruling will be remembered only
as a streak of poor diplomacy on the part
of the officials of that club.
Captain KefÂ«, presiding ju'lge at Ingle
side, accompanied by Mr. Hunt, one of
the leading merchants of Memphis, Term.,
paid the Park and Cliff House a visit
yesterday. Both gentlemen were in
fatuated with the beauties of Sntro
Hei ht< and the people's pleasure ground.

What C. L. Taylor Would do
if Elected Mayor.
"If elected Mayor of San Francisco I
shall do all in my power to secure a ju
dicious and economical administration of pub
lic affairs.
"I shall do all I can to secure to every
Citizen the full benefits guaranteed under
the constitution of the United States and the
laws of California.
"If I become Mayor my mind will be abso
lutely free from prejudice toward any class
of citizens. People of every religion may
firmly rely upon me to pursue a policy of
even-handed justice, without regard to creed,
sect or color.
"I am not a corporation tool or a corpo
ration hater. I have opposed the unjust re
duction of assessments on corporation prop
erty, and I have equally opposed the granting
of valuable franchises, except for a fair
revenue on the earnings for the City.
"I believe in doing everything within
reason for the health and general welfare of
the City. This involves good sewers, a well
equipped Fire Department and an active inter
est in streets, parks and general public im
provements .
"Every law against the best interests of
taxpayers and workingmen should be repealed.
. "Everything within reason ought to be done
to make the Police Department efficient and
in every way ample to guarantee protection
to life and property.
"I believe in being aggressive for the
right, fearless of the evil-doers and vigi
lant where the liberty of the masses are con
cerned.
n The affairs of this City should be ad
ministered on strictly business principles,
just as an honest man would administer the
affairs of a great commercial institution.
"The Mayor ought to do all in his power
to see that every department of the govern
ment is efficiently administered, and he
should be in touch with every branch of the
administration. "
A CLEAN TICKET
IS SURE TO WIN
The Republican Municipal
Candidates Appeal to
the Masses.
Colonel Charles L. Taylor's
Candidacy Is Sweeping
tbe City.
GOOD NAM3S FOR EVERY POST.
Man Who Combine Honesty and
Ability, and Who Inspire the
Confidence of Voters.
As the time draws near for election
there is every evidence of a great Republi
can victory. Colonel Charles L. Taylor's
name is heard everywhere and his candi
dacy is growing so fast that all opposition
will be snowed under by an avalanche of
votes.
Democrats by thousands. Populists,
lion-Partisans and Republicans are out in
earnest for the sterling candidate, who
represents all that is stable and progres
sive in local statesmanship. He is admired
because he has spoken on every question
of vital interest in ringing, manly tones,
and all his utterances have been for the
right.
Day by day Colonel Taylor's candidacy
has grown in power, and in spite of the
bitterest attacks nothing has been whis
pered derogatory to the brave Supervi
sor's ability or honor. His spotless record
stands like an immovable monument as a
testimonial to his high character. No
narrowness of politician*, no bitterness of
enemies can convince anybody that tnis
brave man has ever made a single move
in public or private that he did no: be
lieve to be for the general welfare of the
masses and the prosperity of the City.
It is now a foregone conclusion that
Colonel Taylor will be elected by an over
whelming majority, and there is equal
evidence that ne will add strength to the
excellent ticket that his name heads.
None who know William A. Deane per
sonally or who have heard of his spotless
reputation and sterling abilities will hesi
tate to vote for him for Auditor. He !>as
the peculiar business insight and abilities
necessary for the proper fulfillment of the
duties of that office.
Mr. Deane is an old printer and a mem
ber of the Typographical Union. He is
also a Native Son and a member
of Stanford Parlor. Besides this he
is a past chief ranger of the For
esters of America. He has held the
important position of chief clerk of the
insolvency department in the County
Clerk's office and is in every way well
qualified to hold the position he aspires
to. He has been in every office in the City
Hall and is thoroughly informed in de
tails. Mr. Deane is a married man and
has one child.
For Tax Collector the regular Republi
can party coutd not have selected a
stronger candidate than Cord H. Wetjen,
a man of sterling character and wide repu
tation for integrity and business acumen.
Mr. Wetjen's ioilowers are the best people
and he represents the good traits of the
strong German character.
For Treasurer the name of Augustus C.
\V ldber recalls his illustrious lather, while
his own spotless record as his father's
successor is enough to inspire confidence
in all voters. No better man than Mr.
>N ldber could have been nominated for
Treasurer.
The name of John R. Aituen for Attor
ney and Counselor inspires, confidence
among people and lawyers alike. He is
an attorney with a good record,' a man of
â  potless character and rare ability
Charles S. Tiiton has shown his fitness
for the office of Surveyor. He held the
position once, and all who had business
with him or who remember his r cord can
testify that he is eminently ritted to be re
turned to the place. He is in every way
able and ought to be elected.
George W. Elder outrht to be the next
Superintendent of Streets. H â  says he
would save the taxpayers $100,000 annu
ally and repave Market street without
more money than the present appropria
tion. He would allow no deputies to con
duct saloons or force men to patronize
them. He denounces the present regime
as ext'avagant, and says Ashford spent
$169,000 uselessly on repairing accepted
strcet-i. Over the sewer department Mr.
Elder would place a deputy who is a civil
engineer, and there are scores of reforms
he would inaugurate.
Judges of the Superior Court.
Chesley K. Bonestell, Carroll Cook,
John F. Finn and John Hunt ought to be
W. A. Deane, Regular Republican Nominee for Auditor.
the next four Superior Judges. They de
serve it by right oi sterling integrity and
rare ability.
Mr. Bone.Bt.sll is a Republican of recog
nized ability and high standing in the
(Community. Lawyers say he is able and
safe and the people have full confidence in
tjis ability and honesty.
Carroll Cook's name is known all over
California as a synonym for legal astute
ness. As a criminal ana constitutional
lawyer he has not a superior anywhere.
His record is spotless and has never been
questioned even by his political enemies.
John F. Finn has been tried as Judge
before, and no act of his ever disappointed
his warmest admirers or left room for the
unkind criticism of his enemies. He is a
man of wide experience, clever abilities
and undoubted honor.
Joi.n Hunt's candidacy is a compliment
to ability and judicial honor. He is recog
nized as a shrew.i and fearless Jud c and
as a lawyer who has won his spurs by na
tive ability ana unremitting toil.
Police Judge*.
James A. Campbell, Henry L. Joachim
sen, Charles A. Low and Alfred B. Tread
well ought to be the next Police Judges.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, NOVEMBER 2, IS9G.
All but Mr. TreadweL are now incumbent-,
and their records speak *or them. Judge
Treadwell, however, is an able criminal
lawyer, and baa been a Police Judge be*
fore, at Stockton.
Judge Campbell Is famous as the friend
of rigut and the enemy of wrong. He
gives every case a fair hearing, is free
from bias and is sure to be re-elected by a
rousing majority.
Judge Joacbimsen has been a faithful
public servant for so many years that
more than a mere mention of bis name is
superfluous. He is fearless, abe and hon
orable and the people wiU make Him
their Jud c again.
Judge Charles A. Low was formerly a
reporter, became popular, then becpme
Judge. He is a hard worker and has so
mastered the details of the position which
he holds tuat he ought to be put there
as:ain. He is a strong enemy of evil
doeis and a man of education, honor and
ability. .
Judge Alfred B. Treadwell is a man of
wide knowledge of the criminal law and
01 human nature. He is everywhere pop
ular and everywhere re>pecied. In addi
tion to his other acquirements the Judge
fluently speaks French, Italian, Spanish
and German. He is learned in live lan
guages.
Justices of the Peace.
J. E. Barry, G. W. F. Cook, G. C.
Groezinger, Frank H. Kerrigan and Orrin
K. McMurray should be elected Justices of
tbe Peace. All but Mr. McMurray are in
cumiients, aud he is a man ot judicial
habit of mind.
Judge Barry was prominently men
tioned for Superior Judge, but felt content
to serve awhile longer below. There is no
man more fit to be continued in office.
Mr. Cook has made a splendid record as
Justice and he has friends enough to re
turn him to the place. Like Judge Barry
he has won his way to popular iavor by
strict attention to business.
Jurige Groezinger belongs to a sturdy
race and be is no exception to the fact
that they discbarge their duties aright.
He will be re-elected.
Mr. McMurray is a well-known and
tliorou_hly reputable lawyer. He is a
hard-working and fair-minded man, whose
knowledee ib ample :or the proper fulfill
ment of the duties of the place, ana his
reputation is beyond reproach.
The Supervisors.
For the office of Supervisor the Republi
can Convention permitted no influence to
oear upon its members in the convention
by which the personal friend of any one
man received the nomination who other
wise was not worthy of the office.
For the First Ward John Hayes leads
off. This gentleman is so well known not
only in the ward which he will represent,
but to the entire shipping and mercantile
community, that no other name has teen
mentioned about tne^entire City front but
that of "Hayes."
The Second Ward has for its nominee
Daniel W. Wessenberc, an old and re
spected citizen of North Beach â a man
so universally esteemed for bis honesty
and business ability that when his name
was mentioned before' the convention all
other competitors retired. As to the
duties of a Supervisor, he said that if
elected he would give to the office tne
same close attention that he has given to
his business.
The Third Ward nas for its nominee
John L. Hanly, who has been connected
witn the Deming-Palmer Milling Com
pany for a number of years. The continu
ous employment of a man in the service
of this company is of itself a sufficient
guarantee of a man's fitness of any office
of trust in the government of the State or
City.
The Fourth Ward is more than fortu
nate in the nominee given to its residents
in the person of H. A. Steffens. "Big
hearted, generous Henry" is the way Stef
fens is spoken of by his friends and neigh
bors, and this appellation is no misnomer.
No belter man could have been nominated
for tbe office of Supervisor.
The Filth Ward will undoubtedly be
represented in the next Board of Super
visors by Thomas G. Walkington, the pro-
Dnetor of the Mission Bay Warehouse,
whose business associations and connec
tions with the mercantile community is
so well known that when his name was
mentioned in the convention ltlwas con-
sidered a grand capture to have him con
sent to accept. He did do so upon the
urgent request of some of his friends who
had deplored the present bad condition of
the City's government by the solid eii?ht.
To elect Sir. Walkington is to assure a
strictly honest and capable representative
to the Supervisors.
The Sixth Ward will, it seems certain,
have a representative in the person of
honest John Lackmann, who has owned
and conducted a grocery at 818 California
street for a number of years. So well
known i- Mr. Lackmann by the wholesale
merchants that his word is as sood as
many other tradesmen's written guaran
tee. Honest ana capable, he will faith
fully discharge th=> duties of a City Father.
The Seventh Ward has for its nominee
one of the best-known men in that sec
tion of the City in tho person of John H.
Daly, a man who can boast of having more
friends to the square foot in the ward and
for a considerable area outside of it than
any other of the many nominees for the
same office.
The Eichth Ward, the banner Republi
can ward of the City, thai in days roue
by never was known to elect a Democratic
Supervisor or School Director, has for its
nominee Thomas Morton, the well-known
One of the most important offices the voters and taxpayers of this City will be
called upon to fill at the coming election is that of Superintendent of Streets. The
proper man for the position, as evidenced both by experience and a record of which
any man mieht well be proud, is the regular Republican nominee, George W. Eider.
For a long time Elder s-erved as expert in the Street Committee of the Board of
Supervisors, and while occupying this position it is estimated that he saved the City
many thousands of dollars. His actions have always been dominated by a strict sense
of duty, and so far as compatiDle with the proper execution of work his recommenda
tions to the committee have been on the side of economical expenditures. At no time
when the appropriations asked for street work have been in excess of the amount
actually necessary has Eider failed to lift a warning voice. And this has been done
without regard to offending friend or foe.
As an instance of Elder's attention to duty and strict integrity may be mentioned
the clear and forcible manner in which he proved last May that Superintendent Ash
worth's demand for an appropriation of $1,558,180 10 for the expenses of his depart
ment during the next fiscal year was out of all proportion to the work to be done.
"Why," he exclaimed, "I should like nothing better than to take a contract to do
that identical work for which Superintendent Ashworth imagines he. needs over a
million and a half of dollars for $750,000, and I would give bonds to do a satisfactory
job. I've Carefully investigated the Superintendent's estimate, and am prepared to
prove the trutli of my statements."
Then Elder took up the appropriations asked for the various departments and
pieces of work to be done one by one and demonstrated conclusively the truth of his
estimate. His words showed his familiarity with the City's needs in every particular
as regards the work on ou r streets and a thorough knowledge of what tue work would
cost if rightly done. So it has been at all times. His excellent personal character
and conduct are vouched for by a host of friends.
As Elder himself said in an address delivered a few evenings ago before the
Phoenix Republican Club: 'By diligent attention to duty I may have made some
enemies, but ati3' other houest man would have done the same." Taxpayers oannot
do better than place such a man in so important an office.
coal dealer, a man who is aure of being
elected.
Thomas Morton has the go d fortune of
being known and respected all over the
City. This he has honestly earned by
many acts of charity. Many poor fami
lies all over the City have had a cheerful
and neressary fire by his donation of bags
of wood and coal. Generous and warm
hearted as be is, he possesses all of that
self-will so characteristic of his Scotch
ancestors â the same kind of will Andrew
Jackson and U. S. Grant possessed. Hav
ing succeeded in business from a small
start thirty-three years ago to one of com
parative independence and with a first
class character, San Francisco voters will
have no cause to report having elected
Thomas Morion to the Board of Super
visors.
The Ninth Ward has for it" nominee the
well-known business man,K. W.Heilmann,
who has been a resident of the ward for a
number of years, and in consequence i? so
well known that his election is an assured
fact. Mr. Heilmann has been in the soap
manufacturing business for the past
twenty-five years. He has raised a family
in this City, *nu few men stand higher in
the business community.
The Tenth Ward has for its nominee
Edward J. Smith, a well-known druggist,
who resides at 866 Folsom street, in which
vicinity he has carried on business for a
number of year*. He is a practical busi
ness man, and favors progress when it is
essential, and also strict economy in the
management of the City's business.
The Eleventh Ward, which wants big
deals in everything, has got one of the
biggest of men from a progressive stand
point in the person of Ch.irles M. De
pew, president of the planinp-mills com
pany of that name located on Berry street,
for its nominee for the Board of Super-
Visors.
The Twelfth Ward has a variety of
nominees, but the very best of all those
placed on the ticket is E. H. Aigeltinger,
who for years has been engaged in the
hay and grain business on Ellis street.
With him as the Twelfth Supervisor ..he
other eleven need never fear of failure to
do the right thing at the right time.
School Director!.
Dr. George I. Drucker, who has been
honored with tne nomination of School
Director, is a promising young dentist of
the modern school.
He is the youneest son of ex-Bupervisor
August Drucker and a native of this City.
He attended the puolic schools and the
State university, graduating from the den
tal department. He is connected by the
marriage of his sisters with some of the
highest in the social and business circles
of this City.
On the subject of the management of the
public schools Dr. Drucker said:
I wag educated in the public schools of this
City, consequently know the value oi a public
school education. lam in favor of a most lib
eral policy for the management of the school
department, but at the same time there should
be economy in th" expenditure of the funds so
liberally contributed by the taxpayers for its
support. The teachers should be paid tbeir
salaries regularly aud due regard aud atten
tion shou.d be pMid to the classrooms to the
end that they be kept in good sanitary condi
tion bo thai ihe health of the pupils be not im
paired. UnderstÂ«nding this, i shall, if ciected,
do my utmost to conduct the school- on busi
ness principles and on the principle of a father
caring lor his children, as my father did whila
securing <ducation, comfort and happiness
for his children. The children in the public
schools are entitled to parental care from the
school directors.
J. L. Halsted, a most worthy cit'zen and
a pioneer of this State, when asked for his
views answered as follows:
My record as a School Director is well known
In this City, having fii ed that position tor"
two years. The same libi-ra policy as regards
the management of the schools that I pursued
th^n would be my guide in tho future. The
public scuools must be conducted on a broad
and liberal plane, for as the schools are con
ducted so are our children inculcated with
I broad and patriotic ideas.
Philip Hammond, a man of mature
years, with a sharp and quick mind, said:
I have always been a friend and admirer of
the public school system of the United Suites,
and had 1 not I certainly would not have
accepted a nomination at the hands oi the
Republican party for the office. I will, if
elected, deal iairly as between the distribution
of the school lunds and the healthy adminis
tration of ;he department The schools must
be kept vigorous. We cannot permit dry rot
to get in them.
C. E. Fredericks, well known and who
stands high in the mercantile community,
said :
I consider the duties and responsibilities of
a School Director of more importance to the
lv * u *? as weil as to the present condition cf
i!f V' atlon than those of any other office to
which a citizen can be elected or appointed.
The educati n of the child invariably maps
out his future course through lite. Hence
how Important it is that Directors should well
and truly discbarge the trust reposed in them.
Appreciating this responsibility, I will, should
I be elected, perform my duty as & Director
faun tally and conscientiously.
E. L. Head, who holds the responsible
position of receiver for the Sorin Valley
Water Company and possesses the qualifi
cations necessary to make a good School
Director, said :
To be elected a School Director is one of the
most sacred trusts that could be Imposed on a
citizen. And if lam elected a member of the
board I shall discharge my duties with
scrupulous regard for the welfare of the chil
dren and the public
William A. Kemp, a young business
man of this City, said:
I know of no branch of the> National, State
or Municipal Government which demands
from any ot its representatives a more exact
discharge of pudic duty Â«Â»nd trust than that
of managing the public schools, as they should
be managed for the good and welfare of the
eatlre people.
William T. Kibbler, a prosperous and
successful chemist and resident of the ban
ner Republican district, the Thirty-ninth,
said:
I look upon a well-conducted public school
system as one of the safest and strongest bul
warks of our great American republican form
of government, and the American citizen who
would attempt to destroy its usefulness is a
secret â¢nemy of the country and its institu
tions. If elected I make it my special
study to keep our school system free from
everything that might in any manner tend to
injure its high purpose.
G. A. Kohn, a City-front merchant,
well known for his sterling business quali
ties, expressed himself as follows:
The taxpayers of San Francisco contribute
most cheerfully to the support of the common
schools. In this they stand second to no other
country's citizens on the face of the globe. I
should consider it worse than high treason for
a school Director to be guilty of the misman
agement of the trust reposed iv him by his
fellow-citizens.
Dr. Ernest H. Mattner said:
Some wise statesman said that a public office
is a public trust. I go further and say that the
office oi Director ot the Public Schools, whore
our children are being educated, is one of the
most sacred of trusts. And to my mind the
American who would abuse this most sacred
of trusts should be driven out of the com
munity by the same method that the early
settlers in the mining camps drove out the
horse thieves and robbers. With this view of
the responsibility resilng on me, should I be
elected, I will, if in my power, keep in mind
the exalted position of the people's schools for
our dear children.
William H. Powers, connected with the
printing-house of Hicks, Judd & Co., said ;
I have been a friend of the public school sys
tem of education for the American children
all through life, because I recognize that in
that system and by it alone can this great
country be kept loyal to itself and obedient to
Its laws and institutions. It levels all Darriers
between the rich and the poor. It imbues that
equality among he masses that forever pre
vents classes and teaches that all men are
equal before the law. with appreciation of its
great benefits it will be my aim if elected to
perform the duties of a Director to thB very
best of my ability.
Dr. J. H. Soper, at present a member of
the Board of Education, needs no ex
tended introduction to the voters. He
said:
Since my appointment to the Board of Edu
cation I have performed my duty to the very
best of my ability. To continue to do so shall
be the ambition of my life.
F. L. Tuipin, proprietor of several
hotels and lodging-houses, said:
From the high personal character of my as
sociates on the Republican ticket for School
Directors the people of ihis City need have no
lear regHrding :hu management of ihe schools
for the next two years. With such a fine body
of men 1 could not (Jo wrong, even if I wished
to, but I have no such intention or inclina
tion. I consider a man holding the position
of School Director equal to that of a faih r in
his own family. The children's welfare shou.d
be looked atter with jealous care. They are
the wards of the people nnd the directors are
their guardians. Hence no man should as
sume to become the guardian of a ward who
knows and believes he has not the ability to
care for his charge. I shall consider it my
duty to look after the thou-ands of little ones
with the same care and attention as I would
my own children.
