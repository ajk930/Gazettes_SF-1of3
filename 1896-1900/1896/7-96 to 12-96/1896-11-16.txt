VOLUME LXXX.-NO. 169.
REPRESENTATIVE MEN WHO BELIEVE THERE SHOULD BE A MINING SECRETARY
Governor Buddâ The suggestion that the mining interests of the country should
be represented in the Cabinet by a Minister is timely. I believe Congress ought to
c.-eate a Cabinet position of that character. Agriculture is now represented in the
Cabinet, ana the mining industry of the United States should have eoual recognition-
An act of Congress is all that is needed to establish the proposed office. The duties
" of the Minister might be extended to a control or supervision of the whole coinage
pystem of the Government.
YESTERDAY The Call published a
number or reasons why the Federal
Government should establish a Bu
reau of Mines and Mineralogy as a reg
ular department of the civil service.
The following interviews with weil
â  known mining; men show that the idea
meets with approval among those wno
. know most about the subject, and whose
, interests are directly and indirectly
Effected by the department in question.
Ex-United States Senator Charles N.
Feltonsaid: I would not like to give an
opinion, off-hand, concerning the expedi
ency of establishing the Cabinet position
of Secretary of Mining. The Interior De
partment has administered the laws rela
tive to mines as they have been adoDted
by Congress. There have bsen some
rulings by the Interior Department that
occasioned considerable discussion, but
the laws generally reflect tbe experience
and wishes of mining men. Thus far the
mining interest has seemed to get along
very weil under the Interior Department.
The question concerning the appointment
of a Secretary of Mines which may be
considered uppermost is whether such an
appointment will benefit the mining in
terest. I do not care to give an opinion
on that point. It may be possible that
new regulations could be adopted which

Ex-President Harrison Not Booked fcr
Secretary of State, but Dr. Depew
Hay Become an Embassador-
CANTON, Ohio, Nov. 14âPresident
elect McKinley passed another very quiet
Sunday.. Mr. Webb Hayes, son of. the
late President Haye?, came down from
Cleveland on a morning tiain, and spent
the day at the McKinley residence.
Major McKinley declared that his health
was never better, and "that he had cofn
â¢pletely recovered from the fatigue of his
campaign labor. Mrs. McKinley's health
has been so far restored that she was able
to go driving for half an hour this after
noon. Major McKinley, accompanied by
Mr. Hayes and Captain H. O. Heistand,
attended morning services at the First
Methodist Episcopal Church.
Although various newspapers have pub
lished complete Cabinet outfits for the in
coming administration, it is safe to assert
that not one of them has been built upon
anything resembling authoritative an
nouncement from Major McKinley or
those who are closest to the President
elect.
Iteis evident that the President-elect
has not made up iiis mind as to the forma
tion of his Cabinet, not even decided upon
the geographical allotment of places
therein. It is further apparent that Ma
jor McKinley will not consider Cabinet
candidates until after his return from his
visit to Cleveland. According to present
the President-elect and
Mrs. McKinley will leave for Cleveland
on Wednesday morning.
Since Chauncey M. Depey has ceased to
be talked about so frequently for Secre
tary of State, there hns been a good deal
of discussion here of the probability of his
beiog appointed Minister to England. It
The San Francisco Call
would hamper the miners more than they
would help them. It may also be true
that laws to be passed by Congress, which
would be carried out by the constituted
authorities, would give relief where it is
needed. These are only suggestions. If
the appointment of a Secretary of Mines
would help the miners there is no ques
tion that it would be a good thing. The
mining interest is of great and growing
importance.
Priyon'^tJommissioner E. J. De Pneâ l
am heartily in favor of Congress creating
a Department of Mines and Mining. It
would certainly be a great benefit to the
mining industries all over the United
States. The Secretary of such a depart
ment would be able to give a great deal of
very useful statistical information mpon
this, one of the largest and most impor
tant of industries. The coal mines of the
East, the copper mines of the lakes and
elsewhere, and the gold, silver, lead and
yin mines of the western haif of the conti
nent would all receive a aeal of benefit
from the establishment of such a Federal
institution. The farmers have their De
partment of Agriculture and a Cabinet
officer to preside over the same and look
after their interests; why should not the
miners be equally protected, provided for
and enlightened? Mining is of as much
importance as any industry in the United
States. In the establishment of such a
is known that Major McKinley has a very
kindly feeling for Mr. Depew, and the lat
ter's friends here assert that he would rind
life at the court of St. James extremely
agreeable. He would have a great field
I for Bpeecbmaking, and all of his work
would be of a congenial sort.
â .It may be set down as certain that un
less the unexpected happens Benjamin
Harrison will not be urged to take the
portfolio of State in Major McKinley's
Cabinet. General Harrison i 3 not thought
to desire this appointment, and the belief
here is tliat the President-elect has about
decided to offer it to some one else.
A friend of Major McKinley said to
night that Senator Sherman undoubtedly
expressed the desire of most of McKin
ley's closest advisers when he said that
Congress should pass the Dingley bill this
winter. The new administration will not
care to be saddled with an extra session
Congress, and Major McKinley will have
quite enough to occupy him in organizing
his administration.
Major McKiniey'f advices from Texas
are of a most satisfactory character. They
indicate an increase in the Republican
vote of the State of over 100 per cent. In
Navarro County, the home of Roger Q.
Mills, the great tariff reformer, Major
McKinley secured a plurality of 122 votes.
The county has heretofore been over
whelmingly Democratic.
Among tne congratulatory messages
received to-day was the following: "The
American students in Heidelberg send
greetings and congratulations to the repre
sentative of American honesty."
Henry Clews of New York writes : "The
magnetic effect of your election has
already advanced the price of securities
dealt in at the New York Stock Exchange
over $100,000,000 and a corresponding'
amount in the securities dealt in in the
different local markets throughout the
country. Spot cash wheat has advanced
both in Chicago and New York, since the
election, 14 cents a bushel. It has reduced
the rate of interest od call money in New
York from 100 percent per annum to 4 per
cent, and time money lrom not being
obtainable on scarcely any terms is now
being freely offered at from thirty days to
a year at 4\4 per cent per annum. Mer
cantile paper was unsalable, while now it
is sought for at 5 per cent per annum. A
general shut-down was planned by manu
facturers in the event of your defeat,
whereas now, as the result of your elec
tion, increased labor is being employed
and machinery that was heretofore idle,
caused by the prolonged bad times, is
starting up again with renewed vigor in
all divisions.
"The activity which will prevail through
out this country from one end of it to the

SAN FRANCISCO, MONDAY MORNING, NOVEMBER 16, 1896.
department I believe that economy should I
be observed. The California State Miners'
Association is doing a good work for the
State, and it Is to be hoped that it will be
successful in securing a department and
a secretary who will look after all mining
matters.
State Senator A. F. Jones of Oroville
Butte Countyâ While I have not looked
specially into this proposition still I have
sufficient information upon the subject to
satisfy me that such a Cabinet officer
would do a great deal of good for the min
ers, not only in this State but all over the
United States. The miners of California
have had much to contend against and in
every instance it was a single-handed fight
until the association was organized. In
this State they have had not only the
courts to contend against, but they have
met with bitter opposition from the De
partment of Agriculture. The mining
interests should be protected by a repre
sentative in the Cabinet where nearly all
of the other interests are in a measure
represented and carefully protected. Such
a department could be operated in connec
tion with the Smithsonian Institution,
which now has as exhibits, implements,
machinery and apparatus for mining of all
classes, ancient as well as modern. Then
there are times when the Secretary of
Agriculture and a Secretary of Mines and
Mining could compromise cases of con
flict between the farmers and the miners
without recourse to the slow and expensive
processes of legal strife. Both would be
benefited and much trouble saved.
J. M. Wilkins, Prison Commissioner â
The Department of Agriculture has done
much good in the United States by estab
lishing experimental stations and dissem
inating knowledge over the land. A De
partment of Mines and Mining would do
the same. When we consider our vast re
sources in this field it only stands to rea
j son that this industry should have proper
! representational the seat of Government
j the same as many others. It would cer
tainly be of great benefit to California and
all sections where any kind of mining is
carried on. While 1 am not a miner, I
cannot overlook the importance of this
great industry, and I am heartily in favor
oi any movement that tends to advance
( it. In .such a bureau much could be done
lin the line of experimental work that
would save much trouble to individual
miners and enrich the country at large by
untold millions. Private enterprise can
do much in the exploration of the new
field of science, but how much more rapid
j would the advancement be should tne ex
j perimental work be done by the Govern
ment that, in the ions run, would be en
riched and benefited far beyond the cost
of such research.
George Stone â The establishment of a
Department of Mines with a Cabinet
Minister has become a necessity. In
its connection with the general gov
j ernment the business of mining requires
prompt action relating to titles and the
settlerrent of conflicting claims, and the
congested condition of business in the in
terior Department for years past has
I caused much loss and vexation for those
I engaged in mining. The governmental
control of mineral lands in connection
with other public lands does not work
satisfactorily, as we in California Know.
Judge Wiliiam T. Wallaceâ The idea oi
I having in the Cabinet a Secretary of
Mines is to my mind a splendid scheme.
The production of precious metals is in
deed a very important subject, especially
since the declared policy of the Govern
ment is to sustain the gold standard.
Surely measures should be adopted to
i as the only means of obtaining the neces
j saries of life. The education in the fun
damental laws of finance which our peo
ple have received in the past campaign
place us in a unique position. The result
of building up credit and business upon
such a foundation must surely bs such as
to make a period of prosperity as has
never before been approached."
Hon. J. O. Dicknian, Judge of the Su
preme Court of New Yort: "Your last
letter to Mr. Hanua made my heart leap
for joy, and I could grapple you to my
soul with hooks of steel. You stand on
a plane with Washington and Lincoln
and have opportunities seldom vouchsafed
to mortal man."
Hon. Edward O. Wolcott, United States
Senator, Denver, Colo.: "I cannot but
believe that the lime must come when our
people will realize that the prosperity of
the whole country and the advancement
of the interests of Colorado as well lie only
in your election, for on other questions
they are intelligent and conservative. We
are all rejoiced that the wisdom and pa
triotism of other States so triumphantly
elected you."
Hon. Andrew D. White, member of the
Venezuelan Commission, Washington, D.
C. : "No one has felt more deeply than
myself the significance of the recent con
test, not only to our own country but to |
the whole world, and no one has admired |
more your discussions of the main ques- I
tions at issue or the manner in which you
have maintained the dignity of your can
didacy."
Hon. James S. Clarkson, ex-Postmaster-
General : "Your career before your nomi
nation, your campaign of matchless power
and faultless judgment after your nomina

ROW AT A POLITICAL CLUB.
Jt Took Twtmty-Uce Policemen to fit-
ntore the Peace.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 15.â The Twenty
fifth Ward Republican Club came to
blows with itself last night and twenty
five policemen were required to restore
peace. The row occurred in Lincoln Tur
ner Hall and over a dispute between the
county faction and the city faction. The
trouble began when Congressman Foss,
for the city faction, moved that a com
mittee take tne books of the society in
order to prepare for the annual meeting.
The county members, led by Sheriff Pease,
began an uproar, and a center-rush was
made for the books, during which the
records were thrown out of a window into
an alley and a general mixup followed.
In the meantime a not call was turned in
and a platoon of police soon put a quietus
on the refractory politicians.
Ttryan'* I.atevt * Journey.
LINCOLN, Nerb. Nov. 15.â William J.
Bryan left to-night over the Missouri
Pacific for Kansas City where he expects
to be joined by Governor Stone of Missou ri,
promote the development of mines to the
ena of increasing the output of precious
metals. The office of Mining Minister
should be established. We have agriculture
represented in the Cabinet by a secretary.
The policy of the Government to endow
agricultural colleges is wise, and with
equal wisdom it could be extended to em
brace mining colleges. This would en
able the State universities to send to the
mines practical men. I can see in this
suggestion much that is good. Some one
should write to the President-elect, sub
mitting to his judgment the main points
of the proposition.
George T. Maryeâ Tho proposition to
create^ the Cabinet office of Secretary of
Mines is one that ought to receive the fav
orable consideration of Congress. Mining
is of such vast Importance to the United
States that the industry should be recog
nized and encouraged. When the office of
Secretary of Agriculture was created the
country approved the departure, and I am
of the opinion that Congress should take
another step forward and recognize the
value of the mining interests.
A. S. Hallidieâ Reasons which demanded
the creation of a Department of Agricul
ture with a representative in the Cabinet
now demand and justify the establishment
of a Department of Mining with a Cabinet
minister. Many questions affecting min
eral lands, the production of precious met
als and the exploration of mineral terri
tory could be removed from the Interior
Department. I am heartily in favor of
the proposed scheme. I ttiink it would
open the way also for the President to
recognize the Pacific Coast in the selection
of his Cabinet.
J. West Martin â 1 do not see that any
reasonable objection can be urged against
the proposition to create the Cabinet office
of Secretary of Mines. The raining indus
try has grown to be one of such vast im
portance that an independent bureau is
needed, to which questions affecting mines
and miners should be referred. I should
think the President himself would heartily
commend the measure. It would enlarge
his opportunity to recognize the various
industries of the country in his Cabinet.
F. \V. Van Sicklenâ The more I think
of the proposition the more I am impressed
with the good sense of the suggestion. It
striKeÃ me that it is right. There should
be a Secretary of Mines, holding a place in
the Cabinet on an equal plane with the
Secretary of Agriculture.
Oliver Roberts â There certainly ought
to be a Secretary of Mining appointed to
take his place in the Cabinet along with
the heads of other departments. It is as
j tonishine that there has been no such ap
j pointment before, considering the great
j mining resources of the United States.
! On this hemisphere the mineral belt be
: gins in Patagonia and does not end till the
I uttermost parts of Alaska are reached.
1 By all means tho United States should
I have a Secretary .^"Mining. It is said that
I the niotuer lode reaches through a good
part of California, but it really extends
over the whole 01 the mountain region.
I The interest in mining is so great, there is
so much capital in it and so many rami
j fications and uses for the product of mm
I ing that the industry should not longer
be neelected by the Government. There
ought to be a capable mining man in the
Cabinet, and he ought to confer witn the
mining countries of the world, such as
Australia, New Zealand, Africa and other
countries where there are mines, so that
the highest information might always be
at hand in the interest of American min
ers. We have gold, silver, tin, zinc, cop
per, lead, coal and a dozen more minerals.
and together they will go to the home of

YET EXPLAINING DEFEAT
Senator Jour* Continues to Inlk About
Alleged ' Coercion.
LITTLE ROCK. Ark., Nov. 15.â Senator
James K. Jones was in Little Rock to-day
and left to-night for St. Louis, where tie
will be joined by William J. Bryan ana
Governor Stone of Missouri on a trip to
the St. Francis River on a duck hunt.
After that the Senator will proceed to the
National capital to be present at the as
sembling of Congress in December. When
asked if he hnd been quoted correctly in
saying that one powerlul cause contribut
ing to the defeat of Bryan was the placing
of orders at factories to be rilled in the
event of McKinley's election, he said:
"Yes, such orders cut a large figure.
Millions of dollars' worth of these orders
were placed and the manufacturers made
it a point to call their employes in and
exhibit the contingent orders. They im
pressed upon the wage-earners that Mc-
Kinley's election would result in giving
them work for at least six months from
the orders at band. It was the beginning
of the winter, when the men had to do
something to insure themselves the neces
saries for the cold weather."
Speaking of the attitude of business
men in the election Senator Jones said:
"Business men, as & rule, are timid.
Great impression was made on their minds
by the predictions of hard times in case of
Bryan's election. A few days before elec
tion interest went up and business men
argued that if the mere apprehension of
Bryan's election nad that effect the result
of his election sure enough would be that
much worse for them.
"The chairman of our State committee
in Minnesota," continued the Senator, "in
forms me that we lost that State through
the timidity of men known to be in favor
of silver, but who were afraid of business
The resources are great in all of them.
There is an enormous amount of gold at
the bottom of many of our rivers. I un
dertake to say there are tons of it at the
mouth of the Sacramento. Why cannot
the Government, through a competent
Secretary of Mining, dredge this and
other rivers? The gold could be retained
by a system of sluices and the soil could
be used to fill in the tule lands.
Hngn McDonnell, formerly of the Iron
Mountain, owner of a gold mine at Te
hachapiâTo my mind we need a Secretary
of Mining as much as a Secretary of Agri
culture, if not more. Look at the vast
amount of capital that is invested in min
ing. There should be a man in the
Cabinet to represent the industry. There
ought to nave been one there years ago.
There would be better laws for the ven
tilation of coal mines and for tne safety of
men in all kinds of mining. Mining
ought immediately to be recognized as one
of the great industries. If the Govern
ment would do this ii would do only what
was right and would tend to advance and
dignify an industry that, unlike all others,
has been obliged to make its wey unaided.
J. Doolittle, one of the owners of the
Gould and Doolittle mme â There should
be a Secretary or Mines, unquestionably.
The product of mining is greater than that
of any other industry. It is uiore in the
moneyed results, and more men are om
ployed. Agriculture is not to be compared
witn It. Were it not for mining not a fac
tory could run. In fact there would be no
factories, for there would be nothing to
build them with. Those people who are
prejudiced against mining ought to think
of these things. They look upon mining
as a kind of gamble, and their knowledge
of it is confined to what they hear of some
stock deal. But that is no more mining
than a gamble in wheat on the board of
trade is agriculture. Mining is a tre
mendous industry. It has so many rami
fications, too, in the variety of its prod
ucts that you can hardly cast your eye
in any direction that you do not
see them. In more than half the
States the principal industry is mining.
People don't realize what it is. They
think of gold, silver, copper, lead and
iron, ana there it practically ends with
them. With these minerals alone
there are a thousand reasons why
there should be a Secretary of Mining.
When, however, it is remembered that
our quarries properly come under the
head of mining, that petroleum does,
that we could have no paints and no drugs
if it were not for mining, I can scarcely
see how it is possible we have existed so
long as a great Nation and taken no cog
nizance of an industry fraught with such
mighty importance. Then there is
aluminum. Over a large part of many of
our States the soil for a thickness of two
or three feet is permeated with aluminum.
Mining of secondary importance! It
amazes me that people who can sse and
think have not begun to realize a few
things about it. Take it in petroleum, to
which I have alluded. The Standard Oil
Company, whicb mines for oil only, is the
greatest and richest company iv the
world. Think of tne uses of iron alone.
Reflect that without mining we could not
have the electric light. In fact if you
will follow it down, with the various met
als and their ramifications, I think you
will find we will not have anything at all
without mining. We should have a Sec
retary of Mmmc, and President McKinley
should appoint him.
E. S. Arnold, manager of the Abe Lin
coln mine, Cripple Creekâ lt would un
doubtedly be of great value to the industry
disturbances. The snme thing may be
said of Indiana and West Virginia."
"What of the future. Senator?"
'â¢I believe that while we lost the late
election the cause of bimetallism tri
umphed. . Aside from that we have done
good work in ridding the party of barna
cles. Heretofore our platforms had been
dubious and open to construction either
way. The party never rose above that
until this year.
"I have received letters from every
where since the election urging that the
organization be kept ud in the interest of
bimetallism and thorough Democracy.
The committee, of course, intends to do
that. I never saw such a spirit of deter
mination as has been evinced by our peo
ple concerning the fight in 1900. I have
no doubt that bimetallism wiil prevail.
"Thousands and thousands in the West
voted for McKinley in the belief that he
is a bimetailist and will adhere to the rec
ord he made la Congress. On the other
hand the Easterners voted for him believ
ing that he is a monometailist. When
McKinley comes out one'side or the other
he will be in the attitude which Cleveland
placed himself in when he alienated the
groat bulk of his party. If McKinley
aligns himself with monometallism the
Westerners will howl, while if he sticks
to bis Congressional bimetallism record
the Eastern folks will do the howling.
McKi'iley cannot avoid the parting of the
ways.''
Discussing the political complexion of
the next Senate, Senator Jones said no
question will be presented that will com
mand the united party strength on eittfbr
side.

of mining if we had a mining man in the
Cabinet. I should think, however, tnat
in starting a Department of Mining, or at
least in proposing it, it would be met with
the argument that the departmej/t was in
danger of conflicting with some other de
partment, or bureau. But Ido not doubt
that the difficulties, supposed or real, would
be easily overcome. I think mining is as
deserving of recognition in the Cabinet as
agriculture. There is just now a vast
amount of money going into good mines,
and in other mines in different parts of
the Union. We therefore need a Depart
ment of Mining more than ever, and every
one knows we have long been in need oi
one.
School Director Charles A. Murdock â I
can see no possible argument against the
proposition, and the advantages to be de
rived are certainly of great moment. The
mining interests of this country, and more
particularly of this coast, are largely un
developed and need every encouragement.
The Department of Agriculture has proved
a great success educationally and other
wise and I see no reason why the same
should not be true of a department of
mining. A Cabinet representation should
result in great profit to our mines.,
Dr. Charles A. Clinton, School Director â
I am certainly very much in favor of tne
movement for a department of mining.
We need sonje authorized and organized
movement to encourage our mining in
dustries and this seems a most feasible
way of accomplishing good results in that
line. California has good material from
which to choose a Cabinet representative
who could be of vast beneht to our mining
interests. lam decidedly in favor of such
a movement.
H. C. Henderson, School Director â I
consider the plan proposed a good thing,
and particularly so for this coast. It seems
to be the most practicable and intelligent
way of providing for the steady and busi
ness-like development of our vast mining
properties. While this coast would not
reap the entire benefit by any means, the
measure is of such great importance to
our people that it behooves us to do all in
our power to forward it. I see no reason
why we should meet with any opposition.
Thomas R. Knox, Sch 00l Director â
Thi3 is a project which I am enthusias
tically in favor o f . I have attended many
miners' meetings and conventions, and
have long since become convinced of the
great desirability of having a department
of mining established. Mining is to-day
one of the greatest industries of our coun
try, and yet it is practically in its infancy.
It deserves as much fostering as any de
partment of our government.
Thomas K. Carew â The people of Cali
fornia should all be very much in favor
of having a mining man in tne Cabinet.
The vast unueveloped mining regions of
this State deserva National recognition
and this seems a most practical way of
geUiug it. Our mining industries are too
great to be neglected and there is not a
man in California tnat would not be
benefited by their deveiODment. I heartily
indorse the measure.
Dr. Joseph H. Soper â I am in favor of
the proposed Department of Mining. The
field of usefulness of such a department is
extensive and promises most fruitful re
sults. The people of â¦he West, and in a
measure of the whole country, cannot
afford to neglect opportunities as stupend
ous as those which the mining regions of
California spreads out before us. A
Cabinet representative would be a great
thing for the mining interests of our State,
and I am heartily in favor of it.

by a new rival, Japan, which has just
established a trans- Pacific steamship line
to the United States, and, with the co
operation of American capital, is prepar
ing to extend rapidly the service. In 1880
the tonnage of American vessels entering
the United States from the ports of Asia
and Oceanica was 283,395 tons and of
foreign vessels 442.251 ton 3. Fifteen years
later, in 1895, American tonnage had in
creased but a trifle, to 308,481 tons, while
the foreign tonnage had leaped to 657.206
tons. In his argument the Commissioner
says:
"The large and profitable carrying
trade once conducted Detween Asiaticand
European ports by American vessels,
which seldom entered American ports,
has almost entirely passed away. We
have already seen the American flag al
most wholly disappear from the mid-
Atlantic, save as borne by the mail steam
ers of the American line, and the figures
show that the carrying trade of the Pacific
is slipping from us."
B fore it is altogether lost Commissioner
Chamberlain suggests that Congress in

transportation. Within the last five years
Japan's sea-going steel steamers have iv
PRICE FIVE CENTS
meda Miner*' Associationâ Most of the
litigation in which mining men are in
volved to-day is due to the ignorance of
the officials at Washington. The terms
of the mines are not known or understood
there, and as a consequence we are put to
much trouble and expense which could be
avoided if practical mining men were at
the head of affairs. One great thing that
i 3 desired is to have the law so amended
that the Commissioner of the district
shall pass on all matters appertaining to
patents as he is nearest the work and is
best fitted to say whether the laws have
been complied with.
O. B. Rutherford, secretary Alameda
County Miners' Association â It is only
proper that one cf the greatest industries
of the world snould be represented in the
list of Cabinet officers in this country. It
would surely be as proper as to have the
Agricultural Department. Eastern people
know nothing; of mining and the South
very little. In the great growing North
west immense wealth lies buried in tbe
ground waiting to be taken out by man's
labor, while the West and Coast States
have been well prospected and show un
told wealth ready to go into commerce,
but it is a separate business to get it -out.
J. L. Lyon â A Cabinet officer to have
charge of the mining interests of the
United States is an absolute necessity.
The Secretary of the Interior nine times
out of ten is an agriculturist or a city man,
who knows nothing of mining and who
believes that the country's welfare is de
pendent entirely on the protection of ag
riculture, even at the expense of stopping
mining altogether. Tne farmer or herder
is naturally given the preference by such
a man when the matter of obtaining
tracts of land comes before him. This ia
wrong, and can be best remedied by hav
ing a separate department conducted by a
practical miner.
W. S. Thomas â No county of the State
does as little mining as Alameda, yet
there is probably no county which is in
terested in it financially to such an extent
as our own, and everything which will
help the miners will help us. It should
have a department of its own in the Gov
ernment, and only practical mining men
should be employed. There are a large
number of needed reforms in our laws,
none of more importance than that
which allows some clerk in Washington
to reject a patent accepted by the District
Commissioner ana to return it to be gone
all over again at great expense ana
trouble.
Ex-Congressman Warrtn B. English â
The idea i 3 a good one, and if carried out
would be of great benefit to the mining
industry not alone of this State, bat of
the whole great West. If a practical min
ing man were in control he would watch
for the interests of the miners much more
closely than would an agriculturist as
Secretary of the Interior, while this officer
would keep him from trampling on the
real rights of the farmer. In this way
both would be looked after and neither
would be made to suffer.
William C. Ralston â To have a place in
the President's Cabinet would put min
ing before the public in a different light
from that in which it is held by tno
greater part of the population at present.
It would result in a thorough revision of
all mining laws in such a manner that
the miner would be given equal rights
with his brother in the valley who is till
ing the soil. Now he has no such rights,
and is rather looked upon as one who
lives by preying on the agriculturists.
This is all wrong and needs a speedy and
effective remedy.
creased from thirteen of 27,710 tons tÂ°
twenty-three of 106,383 tons. The num
ber of American steel and iron steamers
on the Pacific Coast is forty- three oÂ£ 63,625
tons.
Opposition is expressed at some length
to the proposition found in Senator Frye'a
bill now before Congress to impose 10 per
cent additional discriminating duties on
all cargoes brought into the United States
oy foreign vessels. It points out that for
ov<2r eighty years the United States has
followed the policy of reciprocity in ship
pin?, and declares that every other mari
time nation of considerable ranK has
adopted and now pursues the same policy.
Our total imports for 1895 were valued at
$731,909,965. of which $590,538,362 were
brought in foreign ships.
"The discriminating duty bill would,"
the commissioner says, '-put an addi
tional charge of $59,100,003 on our inter
national cnanges, based on the figures of
1894, an amount approximately equal to
our entire ocean freight bills on imports
and exports."
Iv arguing against this tax the commis
sioner cites the enormous importations of
tea and coffee, aggregating in 1895 $125,
--000,000, and points out that the proposed
tax would be a tax on the consumers of
those articles. Of coffee from Brazil,
$54,000,000 came in foreign vessels, and the
proposed tax would equal $5,400,000. or
sufficient, Mr. Chamberlain says, in coffee
alone to subsidize steamship lines includ
ing twenty-five steamers equal to the St.
Louis or St. Paul, or a much larger num
ber of the class required for South Amer
ican, Asiatic and African trade. Much of
the report is given to tne consideration of
this one question, and the commissioner
reaches the conclusion that the policy of
discrimination " always has been and
always will be thwarted by retaliation."

VARIOUS VIEWS
OF CONGRESSMEN
Opinions as to What Is the
Most Necessary
Action.
Tariff Legislation Required to
Meet the Existing Deficit
in Revenues.
Gold Democrats Will Join the Repub
iicans in Defeating the Schemes
of Silverites.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 10.-With
a view of ascertaining the views of the
leading men in Congress as to the proba
bility of tariff legislation in the next ses
sion of Congress and as to the likelihood
of an extra session, the Washington Bu
reau of the United Associated Presses has
sought the written opinions of a number
of prominent Senators and Representa
tives. The replies received show quite a
diversity of views and are exceedingly in
teresting. A few of them are as follows:
Senator Calvin S. Brice of Ohio re
sponds frankly and fully in these words:
In answer to your request for my views as to
the effect of the late .National election, I an
swer: Firstâ lt is quite certain that the Presi
dent-eleci will, after March 4, 1897, be sus
tained by a large Republican majority In the
House and by a sufficient Republican majority
in the Senate. Second-VThe free-silver men
will be in the minority in the Senate as well
as in the House ol Representatives. Thirdâ
That while some of the free-siiver Senators,
who have heretofore prevented the passage of
the Din-rley bill, with such amendments as
may make certain a sufficient revenue, will, in
v-cw of the result of the election, probably
vote with their Republican brethren, it Is im
material whether they do or not, as, in my
opinion, a sufficient number of sound-money
Democratic Senators will assist the Republi
cans to pass the necessary tariff legislation
in the Fifty-fourth Congress to supply the ex
isting deficit iv the revenue, i, at least, shall
so vote, and I understand that Senator Gor
man and a number of others occupy the same
position. Yonrs very truly,
Calvin S. Brick.
Senator Brice's colleague, Senator Sher
man, who has been quoted at great length
in two interviews diametrically contra
dicting each other, one asserting that the I
Dingley bill would pass, the other saying j
that there was no chance of its passage
and that an extra session was inevitable,
refuses to affirm the correctness of either
statement, but writes as follows:
In the present condition of affairs I do not
care to express my opinion as to the proper
tariff and financial legislation of this or the
next Congress. Very truly yours,
John Sherman.
Senator W. B. Allison of lowa, chair
man of the Senate Committee on Appro
prietions, writes:
I do not think It is practicable to predict
what will be done or can be done as respects
tariff and financial legislation during the last
session of the Fifty-fourth Congress. I hope
the Dingley bill will pass with such modifica
tions as may be necessary to secure sufficient
revenue to carry on the Government. If this
cannot be done during the Fiity-fourth it
teems to me a:i extra session of the Fifty-fifth
Congress is inevitable. Very truly yours,
W*. B. ALLISON.
Senator Joseph R. Hawley of Connecti
cut, witn a modest disclaimer of any de
sire to enter the field as a prophet and a
still more deprecatory remark that any
thing he could say at this time would be
"the cheapest commonplace," adds these
interesting remarks:
As to the "financial legislation" to be ex
pected from the coming session I should hope
that a well-guarded, careful bill defining the
circumstances under which the executive
ii.ight issue bonds may be passed. The possi
bility of adopting a satisfactory revision ol
the tariff (such as might be expected to re
main undisturbed) at the last session of the
Filty-fourth Congress seems to be very doubt
ful. If the revenues permit it the matter
ought to go over to the extra session of the
Fifty-fifth Congress with a view to securing
such revision as I refer to. If that could be
had it would probably give th 3 country a very
desirable rest in the matter lor the next four
years. Yours truly, J. R. Hawley.
Senator Walthull of Mississippi says:
I see no reason to justify the expectation
that there will be any important tariff or
financial legislation at the approaching ses
sion of Congress. 1 can form no opinion as to
what will be aone at "a possible extra session
of the Fifty-fifth Congress" in advance of the
Senatorial elections to occur during the com
ing winter, fours truly, E. C. Walthall.
The views of Senator Morgan of Alabama
and Senator Tillman of South Carolina
have already been published in these
dispatches.
Mr. Dingley of Maine, chairman of the
House Committee on Ways and Means
and leader of the House, refers to his re
cently published interviews in United
Associated Presses' dispatches in which
he expressed the opinion that there was
not the slightest hope of the passage
oi the so-calied Dingley bill by the Senate
at the next session of Congress and
that the House would not propose any
thing lurther in this direction at the ap
proaching short session. Mr. Dingley
adds:
This covers all I have to say at present.
Yours truly, N. Dinglkt.
Representative Grosvenor of Ohio
writes:
I do not believe it is possible that any mate
rial legislation for the benefit of the country
can be passed in the Fifty-fourth Congress.
Defeat, however crushing, disastrous and far
reaching, seldom convinces anybody of the
error of their way, and so the Senators who
have left the Republican party in the interest
of a few silver-mine owners of the West will
resent rather than obey the demands of an
enormous majority of the people of the United
States that the greatest good shall be the rule
of the action rather than the selfish greed of
less than fifty soulless corporations of the
Rocky Mountains. Hence these men who have
no future in the Republican party will resist
ail attempts to relieve the treasury by any
legislation that does not recognize the para
mount interests of the silver-mine owners.
The Republicans of Congress will not submit
to that, and they will have behind them the
overwhelming support of the American peo
ple.
Consequently no good can come of the last
session ot the Fifty-fourth Congress. .' I do be
lieve that the Republican party will be in a
position in the Fifty-fifth Congress to save the
country from bankruptcy and the industries
of the country from destruction. The* line of
action in a matter which will have to be con
..J<ni carefully in ~ the future. 'The conn-'
denee â¢A the American people in the .; patriot- 1
ism and wisdom of the Republican party has
been now emphatically repealed and de
clared.
Any attempt by the House or Senate to im
pede lint carrying Into law the will of the peo-.
pie will destroy the men who attempt it.
They will be rua over and crushed. Yours
truly. c. H. Grosvenor.
Representative Charles A. Russell of
Connecticut, a member of the Committee
on Ways and Means, says:
The patriotic and businesslike duty of the
coming session of Congressâ the last session
of the Fitty-fourth congressâ ls to provide
revenue for the needs of the Government.
That should be done by a proper and reason
able increase of custom duties. It could ba
effected by the adoption of the revenue meas
ure (Dingley bill) which the House passed at
the last session, or some measure on the fame
lines. We have gone through successfully att
election where partisanship was put aside,
and now Congress should put aside its par
tisanship in providing for the necessities of
the Government and doing it immediately. If
this be done business will be further bene
fited, and possibly an extra session of the new
Congress will be unnecessary.
Charles A. Russell.
Representative Steele of Indiana ex
presses Vis opinion as follows:
I hope tbat the Senate will agree to the bill
to provide temporary relief for the Govern
ment and meet the deficiency in the revenue,
and one providing for advertising the sale of
bonds and providing for a temporury loan,
that were reported from the Committee on
Ways ana Means and passed the House last
December. Both were, in my estimation,
reasonable, judicious measures, and if the
Senate would agree to them it would put us In
such shape as to obviate an extra session of
Congress. I am, very respectfully,
George W. Steele.

Various ( ot/iTÂ»i((ees.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 15.âAl
though the official figures of the recent
election nave not in all cases reached Re
publican Congressional headquarters, the
result of the contests in the various Con
gressional districts is known with suffi
cient exactness to warrant the summary
of the political divisions in the House of
Representatives in the Fifty-fifth Con
gress. This shows 207 Republicans, 137

stated that King Humbert has received a
telegram from Emperor Menelik of Abys

tween Abyssinia and Italy was signed on
October 26.
The new convention abrogates the
Uccialli treaty, by the terms of which Italy
claimed a protectorate over Abyssinia,
and recognizes the complete independence
of Ethiopia. Menelik declares free
all the Italians taken prisoners by
the Abyssimans during the recent
campaign, but Italy will indemnify him
for their support while in captivity. Ma

Menelik by General Balriissera, Governor
of Erythrea and commander-in-cbief of

WAR DECLARED ON
THE STEEL POOL
Peculiar Combinations That
Consumers Want to
Down.
Manufacturers Control the Out
put and Regulate Frices to
Suit Themselves.
Some of the Concerns Charge H gher
Prices at Home Than for Steel
Sent to Other States.
CLEVELAND. Ohio, Nov. 15.âCleve
land customers of the companies that
last spring formed the big steel pool are
contemplating the production of their
own steel oecause of the discrimination
by the pool in its prices against the Cleve
land factories. The Lake Erie Iron Com
pany is the company that started the
movement, and all but one manufacturing
concern here have agreed to enter into the
fight against the pool. The Lake Erie
Iron Company will erect an open-hearth
plant. The Union Rolling Mills will also
siop buying billets of the furnaces in the
combination. The combination here is
secret and all its members are agreed on
the one point of war against the pool. The
vice-presideut of one of the big iron com
panies that are fighting the pool gives the
following history of its organization and
workings:
The meeting at which the pool came
into existence was held at the Hotel Wal
dorf in New York City last April. A writ
ten agreement was signed by the repre
sentatives of the companies which formed
the organization and officers were chosen,
a president, secretary and so on and a
commissioner.
The companies which entered into the
signed agreement were these: The Car
negie interests, Jones & Laughlin of
Pittsh^rg; U. Ains worth Steel Company
of Pittsbure, Bethlehem Iron Company of
Bethlehem, Pa.; Cambria Iron Works of
Johnstown, Pa.; Lackawanna Iron and
Steel Company, Pennsylvania Steel Com
pany, Sieelton, near Pittsburg; Shenango
Valley Steel Company of Newcastle, Pa. ;
Maryland Steel and Iron Company of
Sparrow Point, Wheeling Steel and Iron
Company, Ashland Steel and Iron Com
pany of Ashland, Ky. ; Bellaire Steel
Company, Junction Iron and Steel Com
pany of Mingo, Cleveland Rolling-mills
Company of this city, Otis Steel Company
of Cleveland, Johnson Steel Company of
Lorraine, the King, Gilbert & Warner
Company of Columbus, Oliver Steel Com
pany of Youngstown, Union Steel Com
pany of Alexander, Ind., and the Illinois
Steel Company of Chicago. These are
virtually, if not entirely, all of the Bes
semer steel establishments in the country.
One of the features of that instrument
is the production by the several companies,
which is fixed at a given per cent of the
total production of all tne members of the
combination. For instance, the Illinois
Company and the Carnegie Company
each was lo make about 25 per cent of all
the steel turned out in the country. The
Cleveland Rolling Mills' per cent was
fixed at about 10 per cent. In case that
any company produced less than its
allotted share the pool was to pay lo it $2
a ton for every ton by which it was de
ficient, but if it produced more than the
prescribed per cent it was to pay into the
pool $2 a ton for the excess. In a certain
bank a penalty fund was deposited, to
which every signing company contributed
$500,000 to be forfeited upon a breach of
the contract. AH the transactions of the
pool were to pass through the hands of a
commissioner.
Another feature of the contract was that
the country should be divided into dis
tricts or jurisdictions for the'establish
ment of price scales. Pittsburg was made
the basis of the schedule. Throughout
the Ohio, Mahoning and Shenango Val
leys, the Youngstown and Newcastle or
6haron districts the normal rate of $20 25
a ton for billets was to be charged. Pitts
burg. Wheeling and Bellaire, in this juris
diction, are representative points. In
Cleveland, according to demonstration,
steel may be produced with more economy
than elsewhere. The pool agreed that
billets should be sold for $20.75, and in
the Illinois jurisdiction the price was
placed at $20 25. Thus, the Cleveland
Rolling Mills Company and the Otis Steel
Company were to charge $20 75 at their
very doors, though they might send the
same material to the Ohio Valley, pay the
transportation and charge only $20 25.

thÂ« regular work of the convention begins
The first formal session this evening
was devoted to addresses ofj welcome.
Mrs. Solomon, the president, was in
charge, ana amgng those ou the platform
were: Mrs. A. Kohut, president of the
local section; Mrs. Mary Lowe Dickinson
of the National Council of Women ; Ellen
M. Henrotin of Chicago, president of the
Federation of Women's Clubs and the
vice-DreÃident of the National Council of
Women, of which latter she was the prime
mover.
Five-minute greetings were made as fol

Mrs. Dickinson; General Federation
of Women's Clubs, Mrs. Henrotin; Jew
ish Chautauqua, Dr. Henry Berkowitz of
Philadelphia; Jewish Historical Society,
Oscar S, Strauss; Jewish Publication So
ciety, Dr. H. M. Leipziger.
Mrs. Solomon, president of the council,
responded and spokeof the need of a more
perfect organization.
"Our programme." she said, "provides
for the study of Jewish history and litera
ture and the best methods of philanthropy
to be pursued in small circles. We insisted
upon the study of both branches of our
work, in order to widen the field for those
who have been pursuing one or the other.
We encourage our sections to undertake
such practical work as theii cities seem to
require.
"At our congress a minor tone resounded
for the affliction of our coreligionists iv
Russia. The only answer to our prayers
was a mournful echo of our helplessness;
and to-night our hearts go out to our fel
low-beings in Armenia.
"Would we know the details of it all let
us read our own history, where torture,
famine and cold track with dead bodies
our pilgrimage through the centuries.
Let us hope for a time when the pure robe
of religion will no more be trailed in the
dust to cover national sins, greed and am
bition.
"We are here to proclaim our convic
tions that Judaism is needed in the world,
and in our Judaism are concentrated the
greatest ethical and religious thoughts of
a greater number of God-intoxicated souls
than have given birth to any other creed."
The regular sessions begin to-morrow.
CHRISTIAN WOMEN IN THE PULPIT.
Active Work of the Delegates to the
Convention of the Temperance
Union.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Nov. 15.â The pulpits
of sixty-eight churches in this city were
occupied to-day by delegates to the W.C. T.
U. convention. In some of them both
morning and evening serviceo were con
ducted by the Jadies. A full attendance
was brought out and deep interest mani
fested. Missionary work and aid for Ar
menian Christians were the leading topics
discoursed upon. The programme for the
evening began at "8 o'clock with services in
the Methodist Church, conduced by Miss
Frances E. Willard. At 11 o'clock in Ex
position Music Hall oevotional exercises
were conducted by Miss Agnes E. Stack
of England, world's secretary of the W.
CT. U. Mrs. Elizabeth W. Greenwood,
world's and national superinlendent of the
W. C. T. TJ., preached the annual sermon.
At 3 p. m. the Armenian relief mass
meeting assembled, Miss Willard presid
ing. In presenting the condition of the
Armenian Christians and ibe demand for
immediate and generous relief Miss Wil
lard became dramatically eloquent and
the audience was stirred by deep emotion.
She was followed by Miss Rebecca Kri
korian, a native Armenian missionary,
dressed in the costume of her country]
whose report of personal knowledge of
outrages committed by the oppressors of
Armenian Christians was a graphic pic
ture of Kurdish ferocity. Addresses were
also made ty Rev. F. D. Greene, secretary
of the Armenian relief committee, New
York; Miss Margaret Leitch, Ceylon;
Rev. W. H. Palmore, St. Louis. The ex

The pub-committee of the executive
committee of the National W. C. T. U.
having the finances of the union in charge
reported last night in favor of leaving the
plan practically as it is, requesting an
offer of $2 a year from each society in ad
dition to the regular dues. Nothing was
done in regard to the general foreign
agency, but it is presumed that it will
continue it work for a time at least. A
regulation has been made, however, to
the effect that no solicitor from the Na
tional committee can go into any State to
ask money from unions without the con
sent of the general officers of that State.
The following committee on appropria
tions was appointed: Mrs. S. Fessenden

QUESTIONS THAT
WORRY GERMANS
Public Interest Is Excited
Over the Interpellation
in the Reichstag.
But the Government Will Not
Be Embarrassed Concerning
the Course of Bismarck.
Attempts Made to Suppress the News
papers That Expose the Brutaity
of Army Olficers.
fCopyrighted, 1896, by the United Associated
BERLiN, Germany. Nov. 15â Public
interest has been greatly excited over the
promised interpellation of the Centrist
leaders in the Reichstag to-morrow, de
manding tbat the Government disclose
the nature of the Russo-German neutral
ity treaty, the existence of which from
1884 to 1890 was revealed in Prince Bis
marck's recent articles in his personal
organ, the Hamburger Nachrichten, and
an explanation why the agreement was
allowed to lapse. Applications for ad
mission to the galleries have been enor
mously in excess of the capacity of the
space devoted to visitors, and a full at
tendance of members of the Reichstag is
also assured.
it was given out last evening, however,
tbat it is not the intention of the Centrist
leaders to press the debate upon the inter
pellation concerning the revelations of
Prince Bismarck to the extent of embar
rassing the Government, but it is never
theless certain tbat the debate will be a
very spirited one and likely to lead to
sharp exchanges of personalities.
It is also understood that Count Her
bert Bismarck, who it has been suggested
was responsible to a ereat degree for the
publication of the revelationsâ though no-
body now believes that he was â will take
part in the discussion of the Centrist mo
tion. An article in the Hamburger Nach
richten indicates tbat the line of the ex-
Chancellor's defense of his course in
matting the disclosures will be that it was
in the interests of the country, which
ought to learn the motives which actu
ated the late Chancellor Count yon
Caprivi in severing the bond between
Kus-ia and Germany which existed from
1884 to 1890.
If the Government is able to explain
this action on the part of Prince Bis
marok's successor to the Chancellorship,
the Nachrichten says, it will be a very easy
matter to tranquilize Germany by show
ing in what way German relations with
the other foreign powers made a Russian
alliance unacceptable. "It will be equally
important," tne paper continues, "to as
certain whether the policy of England ex
erted an influence euch as did not con'orm
to German interests, and the question
whether a i owerful neighbor like Russia
was not in closer sympathy with Germany
than with Germany's uuversary in Eu
rope (meaning France) is one of the
grandest importance."
This line of argument, however, does
not meet the charge that the ex-Chancel
lor committed a breach of the law in di-
closing state seciets and is rather of the
character ol an insufficient apology for his
course â an apology which only out of
deference to the great name of Prince
Bismarck can possibly be accepted.
Prince Bismarck's persistent attacks
upon his successors and the crown as well
are supposed to be based upon the pre
sumed leaning of the Kaiser toward Eng
land and has a distinct connection with
the ex-Chancellor'a old feud with the Em
press Frederick, to whose influence he has
attributed the thwarting of his Russo^
G rman policy. Nobody suspects the
Prince of being actuated by other than
patriotic motives, but his bias for his per
sonal opinions has always made him in
tolerant of opposition. A majority of ihe
press of all shad, s, while discussing the
matter from iheir respective political
view, are rather sympathetic with the old
Chancellor than otherwise.
The speech recently delivered in White
haven, England, by Lord Lonsdale, who
i* an intimate friend of the Emperor, in
defense of the Kaiser's course in sending a
telegram some months ago to President
Kruger of the Transvaal Republic con
gratulating the latter upon his prompt
and effective- suppression of the Jameson
raid, has creatly added to the anti-Eng
lish feeling prevailing in Germany and
heightened the suspicion that English
family influence is still very much too
strong in the German court. Lord Lons
dale's" explanations of the Emperor's
course certainly do not make amends for
his unqualified assertion that the Kaiser
was nevi r hostile to England's policy in
the Transvaal.
Commenting upon Lord Lonsdale's
speech the Vossische Zeitunqsays: What
ever may have been the Kaiser's senti
ments the whole of Germany was glad to
see the English get a lesson from the
Boer?.
The popular German antipathy to Eng
land, however, does not imply a general
acceptance of Prince Bismarck's pro-Rus
sian policy. The Reichsbote shrewdly
points out the danger of acceding to Rus
sia'B alleged endeavors to reconcile Ger
many and France, and adds that Germany
must first know the price at wh eh France
will abandon her ideas of revenge. If
France now wants to oust England from
Egypt and make France the master there,
the paper says, it will make England Ger
many's enemy, while French pride will
be increased and lead to a great incitement
to wipe out tne defeat at Sedan.
The semi-official Hamburger Corre
spondenz speaks in the same strain, argu
ing that Germany cannot assist in an at
tempt to drive England out of Egypt un
der any circumstances.
A project is now before the Bundesrath
connected with' the lelorm of the military
judicial procedure which includes the
creation of a supreme military tribunal,
but the Federal Governments disagree as
to the advisability of the measure, so the
bill will be postponed until later in the
session.
The sentence of Lieutenant Baron yon
Brusewitz, the murderer of Herr Siebe
mann in a cufe in Carlsrube, has been
confirmed, and the disgraced lieutenant
is now a prisoner in the castle at Ehren
breitstein. Since the cropping ont of a
great number of military scandals oi late,
the authorities nave endeavored to sup
press all mention of them by the press,
and the consequence is that they are not
now permitted to be made the subject of
free comment.
The Treves Tageblatt has been seized
by the authorities on account of the paper
having published an article which was
officially alleged to be insulting to officers
of the German army, and other journals
have been warned against continuing
their comments upon current reports of
military abuses. The article published
by the Tageblatt was In reference to the
case of Leutenant yon Brusewitz, whose
confinement is believed to be merely
nominal. Two street venders of illus
trated papers containing pictures of Bruse
witz's murder of Siebeniann have been ar
rested in Berlin and their papers confis
, ctiied by tne police, who state that they
have orders to hinder in every possible
way the sale of the papers.
The Berlin Tageblatt's comments upon
the Emperor's speech to the recruits on
Thursday, in whidh his Majesty is alleged
to have atterward addressed the oilicers
surrounding him, but purposely spoke in
so low a tone that only those very near
him could hear what he said, were errone
ously conceived. The Tageblatt's article
implied that the Kaiser was merely pre
tending to frown upon the abuses which
have been committed of late, but it is now
known that his speech was a sharp protest
against the practice of officers subjecting
soldiers or civilians to rough treatment.
Germania, the Centrist organ, announces
that Count yon Hompesch, who will lead
the debate on the part of the Centrists
upon the motion of that party in the
Reichstag to-morrow in regard to the
Hamburger Nachrichten's disclosures.
will avoid as far as possible the introduc
tion of the name ot Prince Bismarck into
the discussion, and further says that
Baron yon Buel-Berenberg, the president
of the Reichstag, will intervene if the de
bate assumes a personal character.
There may be some stormy scenes in the
Chamber if "the President does intervene,
as the present presiding officer is not pos
sessed of the suave manner which charac
terized his immediate predecessor in the
office, Herr yon Levetzow, and conse
quently cannot so easily command the
house. The Germania also says that in
the final speech on the motion the Cen
trists will propose the order of the day
and a vote of confidence in the Govern
ment. For the Government Prince Ho
henlohe will have the support of the
members of the Right, but- the Left and
the Socialists will maintain an aggressive
attitude throughout the debates on the
Bismarck and Brusewitz motions.
A petition containing 76,000 signatures
will be presented to the Reichstag, asking
that a bill be drafted reforming the mili
tary law in accordance with modern ideas.
Herr William Liebknechthas written to
the Socialist organ, the Vorwaerts, cf
which he is the editor-in-chief, saying that
n is a mistake to consider the Armenian
agitation the touchstone of Liberal poli
tic?. Ail the rebellions that may occur in
the Turkish empire, he declares, will only
advance the interests of Russia. He aym- !
pathizes fully with all oppressed peoples, |
he says, but in the present Oriental crisis
the Turks are subjected to a combat
against annihilation and they have the
same rights to protect themselves and the
same rights to maintain their existence
that other nations have.
According to an article in the Berlin
Neuste Nachrichten, Dr. Raffel, Justice of
the Peace at Dar-Es-Salama, German East
Africa, has been appointed Municipal
President at Samoa, Chief Justice Ide hav
ing declined to serve another term.
A swindler, pretending to be a courier)
of the Vanderbilcs of New York, has been I

who are to arrive on a certain steamer.
He orders the best apartments in the
establishment and draws up and -igns an
agreement for any sum that may be de
manded, after which he borrows* what he
can from the landlord on the pretext of
being temporarily embarrassed, owing to
the delay of his remittance or for some
other reason, and disappears.
The Berlin newspapers comment freely
upon President Cleveland's attitude in re-
Rard to Cuba, and agree that it ib his in
tention to assert the right of the United
States to dictate Spain's future policy
toward Cuba.
Some journals argue that the corollary
of the British submission in the Venezue

American pretensions on the lines of the
Monroe doctrine.
According to the Schlesische Zeitung
Premier Meiine persuaded the Czar while
the latter was in Paris that to* projected
reforms of the currency of Kasski were in
opportune, and that the Czar $is accord

the Russian Minister of Finance, for a
pure gold standard of currency. The po
sition of M. de Wttte as a Minister, the
the paper saya, has consequently been
greatly shaken.
OUT OF MAPLESON'S COMPANY.
Mme. Darc/e and Sig. Demarchi Will Re-
turn in Disgust to Europe, Claiming
a Violation of Contract.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 15.â Mme.
Darcle and Sig. Demarchi, members of
Colonel Mapleson's Imperial Opera Com
pany, this evening gave out a statement
setting forth that "owing to violation of
contract and inability of Colonel Maple
son to pay, they had severed their connec
tion with the Imperial Opera Company
and would return to Europe Saturday."
Colonel Mapleson late to-night said:
"The new Imperial Opera Company does
not owe either Mme. Darcle or Sig. De
marcbi one cent. On the contrary, she
has over $1000 of our money. This money
was paid them by the directors as an ad
vance. The understanding was that they
were to sing until that money had been
earned, when we were to advance them oth
er sums. Mme. Darcle has sung but twice,
and despite the advance money she held
at noon to-day appeared and demanded
$220, and he asked $180, which we paid
rather than have a discussion. When she
sang the second time a similar demand
for the $220 was made and we paid again.
"Now the whole truth is here. Accord
ing to the terms of our contract Mme.
Darcle was to sing forty times during the
season and she was to be paid $1200 for
each performance. Our contract with the
signor was similar, he also to sing forty
times, receiving $900 per night. I cast
Mme. Darcle in "The Huguenots." He
criticized and did not admire the madams
and said so. I cave her the part again
and found, much to my infinite regret,
that she could not draw. As she was too
hign priced an artist to play without large
returns, I decided to hold her for other
cities where she might be a favorite. To
this she demurred, saying she should
have the nine performances each month,
as agreed. I wÂ«s compelled to refuse to do
so. Bhe no doubt felt dissatisfied because
she had not made a better showing here
and naturally was a trifle piqued.
"The same state of affairs existed in re
gard to the signor. Then they made us a
proposition to return to Europe and ter
minate the contract. Our attorney in
turn told them what the directors would
do in regard lo the termination of their
contract. The offer was refused. We
have had trouble with these two artists
only. Ail the others have been properly
}>aid and are satisfied.
"You may say," said the colonel, in
conclusion, "that we have not in any
manner violated our part of the contract."

\VAShINGTON, D. C, Nov. 15âSena
tor Marion Butler, chairman of the Popu

made public the following letter which he
addressed to Mr. Watson two days after
the receipt of his letter of acceptance:

c Hon. Thomas E. Watson,,'.' Thomson, Ga.âDear
Sir:,, Your, letter of acceptance was : received :
Saturday night. It had been detained la the !
postofflco for want of sufficient postage. 1
: You,' in effect, advise Populists not to sup
port the joint electoral tickets that have been
arranged in a large number of States. Is: it
possible that you fully appreciate the effect of
such advice? â  At â  least, â â¢ upon â¢ reflection;, you
must know that if enough Populists should
follow such advice it would mean the defeat of
Bryan and the election of McKinlev. v ;y; â¢;
Besides, if your advice should be followed
by enoueh I'opuli ts, the People's party would
not have a single elector in the electoral col
lege. In the States where: we , Have joint elec
toral tickets we will get every. elector that we
do get; and besides, it is in those States where
we will get the bulk, if not ail of the People's
[ party Congressmen. .In ; your â  own Â£tato aud
other States which have followed your advice
against electoral tickets we will not get a
single elector, and I fear not many Congress
men, If any.
You certairfly cannot mean, however much
you may have favored a miadle-of-the-roaa
policy in the beginning, to advise your friends
to do that which at this time would be the -i
most effective agency ia placing in power ile-
Kinleyaud his backersâ the trusts and mo
nopolies. Can any personal or party injus
tice, however great, justify us in being respon
sible, either directly or indirectly, for placing
lin power the stock jobbers, monopolists,
I trusts, the British gold rinjr. and all of the
I combined robbers of the people and enemies
i of good srovernauent?
In the namfof outraged and suffering hu
manity, whose prayers to-day go up from mill
ions of homes forW'iliiam J. Bryan in his heroic
and marvelous struggle against the minions of
corporate greed and the hellish gold conspir
acy, let us sink every other consideration and
I hold ud his hands and do the fuil duty of
! Americans and patriots. Let us remember
that it is ft suffering people and a betrayed
republic, and uot Democratic politicians, that
to-day call for our help and demand our serv
ices. Bryan will be elected and the Govern
ment redeemed if every patriot does his duty.
Let us do ours.
Therefore I beseech yon to change at least that
part oi your letter which gives advice which,
if followed, would surely help the common
enemy. If you do not, then you, yourself,
must assume the responsibility of giving such
a document to the public at this time. Yours
truly, Marion Butler.

WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. Many
statements respecting th? attitude of the
administration on the Cuban question
â¢ have been circulated during the past week
and various articles of a conflicting char
. acter have been distributed throughout
: the country. The President has said that
he does not anticipate any trouble with
Spain over the Cuban situation, arid that
there is no intention of changing the dol
icy respecting the matter which was laid
dowji by the administration a year ago.
In addition to this members of the Cab
inet have stated that the Cuban matter
would be Jeft for tha next administration
rl settle.- .
\ While following such a course the facts
warrant the statement that should an
emergency arise requiring prompt and
decisive action the several departments of
i the Government will be found keenly alive
1 to* the requirements of the occasion and
amply provided for any emergency which
. may be encountered. Measures of a pre
cautionary character have been taken to
meet -any critical conditions which may
arise. In other words, the United States
â¢ is judiciously continuing the work of
strengthening its fortifications and works
'of defense, which have been in progress
for several years, and will thereby be pre
â  pared* to change its policy should it be
deemed advisable to do so.
Investigation proves that army officers
â¢ along the Atlantic coast are pushing the
â¢ work in their several departments with all
possible dispatch under orders to have
certain classes of heavy ordnance ready
(or use at as early a day as possible.
. Every precaution for secrecy has been
taken, and officers located at the navy
yard.s decline to discuss their unusual ac
Â° tivity.
While Secretary Lamont says he is try

Of defense for the great expenditures
"which have been made in that direction,
there is no doubt that the maxim, "In
time-of peace prepare for war," has been
passed along the line. No well-informed
official anticipates trouble, but as one of
â¢ them said to-night : "It is like a fire drill
on board ship. We want to know that

FIEItCE BATTLE IN PROGRESS.

â  NEW YORK. N.Y., Nov. 15.â Jack
sonville (Fla. ) special says: Cipher dis
" patches just received report a tierce battle
I in progress in Pinar del Rio. It is be
. lieved that Macco and Weyler have met.
The reports of firearms have been almost
incessantly heard for several hours.
No details of the engagements are given.
/other than the statement that one of the
most decisive engagements fought since
Cuba struck her first blow for freedom is
being waged.
The dispatch adds: Insurgent forces
are we'll located in the hills and are pour
ing a hot lire into the Spanish troops,
which have repeatedly been driven back
â¢ in attempts to capture the Cuban strong
â¢ hold. The insurgents have the advantage
of position, being at a great elevation, but
the Spaniards are making a most desper
ate attack.
â¢Frpm advices since, It look? as if several
towns are in flames. The sky is lighted
up by the constant fire of the artillery.
Whether or not Maceo himself is direct
ing the insurgents tactics cannot at this
time be learned. An outcome of the en
gagement would be impossible to predict,
. for at present both sides are righting as if
they intended to stick at it until the last
man falls. There is no doubt that the
hills of Pinar del Rio will be dyed with
blood before either side claims a victory.
The dispatch then describes the tactics
of the Spanish forces as endeavoring to
surround each elevation separately in or
der to gain a ground of vantage, but adds
that the insurgents' maneuvers in each
case are believed to have prevented any
su,ch result.
HAVANA, Cuba, Nov. 15.â Advices
: reached here to-day to the effect that after
the encounter with the insurgents in the
Rubi Hills, General Weyler continued to
advance into the hills, moving in the
. direction of Sorroa. A scattering lire was
\ kept up against the Spaniards by rebels
hidden in the hills, and the troops lost
one killed and ' three wounded. It is
slated that . Maceo no longer faces the
Spanish forces.
The rebels have again attacked the
town of Condado, near 'Trinidad, and
again used- artillery in their attempt to
capture the place. The garrison repulsed
. the insurgents, 1 killing some of the rebel
artillerymen. Later a force of local gner

ELECTRICITY FROM THE FALLS.
How the Power of Mighty Niagara Is Har
nessed and Transmitted to the
City of Buffalo.
NIAGARA FALLS, N. V., Nov. 10.â At
one minute after Sunday midnight Secre
tary W. B. Rankine of the Niagara Falls
Power Company turned the switch in the
main power-house o! the company, con
necting the monster 5000-horsepower
dynamos with the transformers in the
transformer-house, which are In turn con
nected directly with the Buffalo power
transmission line, and at the same instant
the electric power of Niagara was for the
first time sent out beyond the confines of
the city and direct to Buffalo, a distance
of some twenty-two miles. It was the
grand finale In the long-heralded power
transmission to Buffalo, and it was a suc
cess in every sense of the word. The
transformers and line had been previously
tested by I. R. R. Edmonds of the General
Electric Company, and, on being found
satisfactory and in perfect condition, were
turned over to W. A. Brackenridge, the
engineer of the company. Mr. Rankine
then went 10 the main power-house and
threw the switch.
This first installment is sent out in a
block of 100(1 horsepower ana is for the use
of the Buffalo street railway. The trans
mission line is twenty-two miles. 4000 feet
of which is underground, and the cables
along which the power is conducted are
1,000,000 circular mills capacity. There
are two transformers at this end, each of
1250 horsepower, the largest in the world,
and thiee at the Buffalo end of 300 and 500
horsepower. The course of the current is
from the dynamo through the busbars,
which are three inches in diameter and
I over the transformer to the low potential
switchboard. It goes a? a quarter-phase
current from this switchboard to the
transformer at 2200 volts. In the trans
former it is converted from a quarter
phase 2200 volt to a three-phase 11,000
volt. From there it runs to the high po
tential switchboard, from there to the
lightninÂ«r arresters, and from the top of
the arresters over to the transmission I
line.
Reaching Buffalo it goes into the "step-
I down" transformer, which reduces it from
j 11,000 to 320 volts, and then to the rotary i
transformer, which changes it into a 550- j
volt direct current, in which form it is |
ready for use on the streetcars. The light- |
ning arrester is a curions device and is 90
arranged that if the line is struck by
lightning the current ifl shunted off to the
ground instead of being allowed to pass
throngh the transformer. The current
will be kept on now continually. The
problem of loss in course of transmission
ot the twenty-two miles is one which has
puzzled many of the leading electricians,
but it is thought the appliances, etc., in
the plant wiil make tbe loss small and tne
transmission commercially possible.

Deadly Weapon.
John Strieker, clerk in John Freese's
grocery, corner of Twenty-eighth and
Church streets, was arrested Saturday
night on the charge of assault witii a
deadly weapon.
About 9 o'clock several boys who live in
the neighborhood were amusing them
selves in front of the store, when Strieker,
who had been drinking, rusneu out with a
revolver and fired five shots into the
crowd. It was fortunate for Strieker that
none of tne bullets took effect, although
some of the boys had narrow escapes.
Policeman Belyea was informed that
Strieker had fired the shots and placed
him under arre>t.
Strieker said the boys had been trying
to knock down toe sign and had other"
wise been annoying him. He denied,
however, having fired the shots, but said
that the "boss" had done so.
Georce Heacocks, one of the boys who
preferred the charge against Strieker', said
that Strieker tired the shots and all the
boys would swear to that effect. Two of
the bullets whistled past Heacocks 1 head

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, NOVEMBER 16, 1896.
INLAND TRAFFIC
AT A STANDSTILL
Great Damage by Floods to
Northern Railway
Systems.
Bridges Are Swept Away and
Long Stretches of Track
Inundated.
Enormous Losses to Farmers in the
Valley of the White
River.
SEATTLE, Wash.; Nov. 15.â Seattle is
completely cut off from communication ;
by rail with the outside world. On the
two transcontinental lines running into
this city not a train, freight or passenger,
has arrived or departed within fourteen
hours. This remarkable state of affairs is
due to floods and storms. It has rained
almost incessantly for ten days. Rivers
and small streams are swollen beyond
their banks, and in many the water is still
rising.
All that port ; on of the Great Northern |
system from the Cascades west, including
the coast line, is paralyzed. On the coast
line about three-quarters of a mile of track
has been washed out, and even more se
rious damage has resulted in the Cascade?, j
where the main line crosses Skykomish |
River four times within a distance of two j
miles.
Two railroad bridges are washed out in
this locality and much trackage is inun
dated where the roadbed follows the river. ;
The railroad bridge over White River has '
been condemned as unsafe, owing to high j
waters, which are expected to sweep away !
the structure any moment, and this has
shut off communication with the Northern
Pacific main line, the Portland branch of
i the Northern Pacific and likewise stopped
tratlic on the Columbia and Pngot Sound j
Railway.
Owing to a great landslide the Seattle
and International, connecting with the
Canadian Pacific, has been at a standstill
for fifteen hours. The Northern Pacific is
sending passengers to-day by boat to Ta
coraa, where connection may be made
with Portland.
An effort will also be made to-night to
get out a train from Tacoma overland, but
it is doubtful if it will get through the Cas
cades. For several days ail wires on the
j Great Northern have been down, but this
1 evening one wire was goi into operation
: again. No estimate of ttie damage to the
j railroad's propeny can be obtained now,
j but on the Great Northern alone it wili
amount to many thousands of dollars.
Local Weather Observer Salisbury said
I to-night that the rainfall for Seattle and
! vicinity for November to dateâ fifteen
I days â has been T.Ofi inches. The greatest
I fall known here before for an entire month
j was only 8.1(3 inches.
HOUSES WASHED A WAY.
Extensive Ttamage in Totr.is and Farm-
ing Communities.
TACOMA, Wash., Nov. 15.â The storms
of last week have done ereat damage in this
vicinity. Between Tacoma and Seattle al!
telegraph wires, except one, are down, and
as that one is in almost constant use by
the Northern Pacific it i<i almost impossi
ble to get complete report of the damage
done.
A man who drove to Tacoma from Kent,
twenty miles from here, on the White
River, said the river was jammed by logs
above ihe town. The jam threatened the
destruction of the place unless the North
ern Pacific railroad bridge is blown up.
The Northern Pacific officials deny this,
but one trainman admits that the river is
swollen over its banks and is flooding
White River Valley, to the great damage
of hundreds of farms.
Reports from tl>c southern part of the
State are thht Cowlitz River lias risen
above the highest water-mark in its his
tory, and that Castle Rock, a town of 500
inhabitants in Cowlitz County, is entirely
covered by water from one to three leet
deÂ«D. A strong current has set in there
and many houses are being washed from
tneir foundations. Chehalis reports the
storm tbe worst of the season ir. that lo
cality. Electric light wires are down,
trees uprooted and fences and small build
ines blown down.
The storm here to-day was the worst
since last winter. Early this afternoon a
heavy snowstorm set in and by 10 o'clock
four inches fell, two remaining on the
ground.
The Puyallup River, which is the out
let of all the creeks and small streams of
tills region, has risen two feet to-day, and
where it was a calm, sluggish stream be
fore it is now a raging torrent. A rise of
two or three feet more and the water will
be over the farms and cause great damage.
There wert- no trains between Taeoma
and Seattle' to-day, and overland trains
from Spokane to Portland are running
slowly, with no discontinuances as yet.
In Mason County several hundred feet of
filling on the new Shelton and South
western railway was washed away. It
will cost fully $2000 to repair this.
Laterreports confirm tbe statement that
further danger from the swelling of White
River is threatened, and also say that the
Stuck and Biack rivers are rising rapidly,
and the farmers are la great fear.
SCORES OF OWELLINGS WRECKED
The. White Hlver I.otj Jam Above Kent
Said to Hare Given Way.
TACOMA, Wash., Nov. 16.â A report
received from Kent at midnight stated
that the bridge over White River was
washed away by a log jam late in the
evening and that the stream rushed like
a millrace, destroying dozens of farm
buildings in the valley.
This story is denied by the Northern Pa
cilic people, who say the bridge is safe and
will be eased to-morrow.
Tne railroad company has been prepar
ing all day to complete a new bridge over
White River on a moment's notice, in case
the old oridge should give way.
All telegraph wires to Seattle went
down at the time the bridpe was said to
have been washed away. Nine wire* to
Seattle are crossed betwesn Meeker and
Orting, and Seattle was at midnight with
out communication with the otftside
world, as the telegraph wire 9 east and
north are down.
'1 he bridge over tbe Yakiraa River at
Cle-Elum was washed out to-night, de
stroying railroad facilities between here
and EUensburg.
SAN RAFAEL'S SCARE.
Mischievous Boys Awaken Citizens From
Their S/umbers by Discharg
ing Two Cannons.
SAN RAFAEL, Cal., Nov. 15.â The en
tire town was aroused at 2:30 o'clock this
morning by two sharp explosions, occur
ring almost at the same instant. Wild ex
citement followed, and half-clad naeD,
women and children rushed into the
streets to learn what bad happened. One
mother whose son works in a powder fac
tory across the bay was positive that it
was an explosion of those works, and it
was with difficulty that she could be qui
eted. A man declared it to be a shooting
star, for he Â«aid he had seen a great blaze
as it struck the earth not far off. Another
thought it a belated blast at the stone
anarry in the hilis north: of the town.
Numerous rumors were afloat, and some
even thought the long-time silent volcano
on Tamalpais was making itself evident
again, for on Saturday evening a mysteri
ous light was visible on tiie highest peak
or the mountain. It was not until day
light that the real facts of the explosion
were learned.
In an old shed on the grounds of the
Mount Tamalpais Military Academy there
are housed two 3-inch guns. This shed is
situated between the cottages and the
main dormitory and very near each.
Ropes had been attached by mischievous
youths to the friction primers, so that the
cannons could be discharged from a dis
tance.
Back of the academy and across the
street from it is a vacant lot, thickly
wooded, and it was among these trees that
the mischief makers concealed themselves
wiiile pulling the ropes that resulted in
startling the whole community.
The boys of the academy were out onto
the halls immediately, but order was soon
restored and Second Master Lewis rusda a
hasty inspection to ascertain if any of the
students were missing. It is still uncer
' tain whether cadets or town boys caused
! the commotion.
All the windows in the near cottage and
in the main building nearest ihe sheds
ore shattered and glass fell in showers.
The academy is one of the most popular,
esteemed institutions of the town and it
is generally believed that tbe cannonading
was done by the boys on a lark, rather
than for any malice.
MAY LEAVE MARE ISLAND.
The Monitor Monadnock Likely to Be
Ordered to Sail Around
the Continent. â¢
VALLEJO. Cal., Nov. 16.â The general
impression at the navy-yard is that the
monitor Monadnock will soon be sent
East by way of the Straits of Magellan.
It is a long trip, but can be made with
safety by the big craft. All of the prin
cipal ports will be visited for coal and
fresh provisions. Officers and men are in
hopes this trip will be ordered. Those at
the navy-yard are also pleased with the
idea, us it will show the Eastern people
the stylo of work that has been turned out
at Mare Island.
The monitor Monterey is ready for sea,
but tbe non-arrival of a suitable lot of coal
detains the iron clad in harbor. As soon
as the three or four hundred tons for
which requisitions have been made
arrives, the Monitor will leave for San
Frnn cisco.
.lust an soon as the flagship Philadelphia
is out of dock and coaled she will depart
for San Francisco and resume the duty of '<
', flagship, and then cruise to South Anien
! can ports. Should trouble arise on the
I other side of the continent the admiral
I would probably transfer his flags to
j one of the other vessels and the Philadel-
I phia would sail around tbe Horn.
The battle-ship Oregon will soon be
given a final trial trip. With Captain
1 Kempff as president of the board it is
I safe to say the big vessel will be giv^n a
thorough test. Its commander, Captain
Howison. has served in a timilar capacity
on several boards of trial, and is in li.s
! element when directing evolutions of this
! character. Events may so shape them
selves that he will be the successor of
j Rear-Admiral Beardslee as commander
-1 in-chief of the Pacific squadron. He is in
line for promotion to commodore, and as
Admiral Beardslee's time is up a vacancy
will occur after the admiral has made the
southern cruise on the Philadelphia.

SAFE AT PORTLAND.
Arrival of the Bark Magdalene After En
countering a terrific
Typhoon.
PORTLAND, Or., Nov. 15â The German
bark Magdalene, which has just arrived in
Portland, made a remarkably fast run
from the OrieDt. Her time was given as
ibirty-four days, but she was off the coast
six days before coming into the Columbia
River, so her actual time was twenty-eight
day?.
When only four days out from Hiogo tbe
vessel was caught in a typhoon and nar
rowly escaped destruction. The gale came
down so suddenly that there was little
time to prepare for it, but by instantly
cutting away the lower topsails total dis
aster was tverted. As soon as possible
two five-inch hawsers with large sails at
tached as drags were got over the stern
and steadied her so that she rode through
the gale.
While the typhoon was at its heipht two
of the spars lashed to the top of tbe deck
house were torn from their fastenings, and
coming down on deck pitched about until
they broke three ot the iron bulwark
stanchion?. It was a perilous undertaking
to move around on deck at this time, and
the men were obliged to crawl on their
hands and knees to keep from being
knocked overboard by the tremendous
force of wind and sea. Two days after
getting clear of the typhoon the vessel
sailed into a lot of timber drifting around
in the ocean. Most of it was large tim
bers, and it was in such quantities that al
of it was not lost sight of for tvvo days.
It is believed that it was the cargo of some
lumber vessel from the Pacific Coast.
LOS ANGELES CRUSADE
Police Will Attempt to I>rlva Out Chl-
neie Lotteries.
LOS ANGELES, C\r,., Nov. 15.â 0n
Monday tbe police will inaugurate a cru
sade against the Chinese lotteries here.
The games have been run openly for some
months past and attempts to stop them
by arresting Chinese agents failed. Finally
Chief Glass detailed officers to warn ail
property-owners who leased quarters for
these lottery games that they, too, would
be held responsible. This work has occu
pied several weeks, during which but few
urasta of Chinese agents were made, the
latter having become wary.
The sections infested by the games is
within a radius of four blocks from the po
lice station. Beginning to-morrow the
police wiil arrest all owners of property
where the games are conducted. They
will be fined heavily. If this fails to stop
the games an attempt will be made to
reach the players. Two Chinese com
panies have lost several thousand dollars
within tbe past two days and been forced
out of business.

DEDICATED IN
MERCY'S CAUSE
Salvation Army Farm for
Discharged Convicts
Sanctified.
Hundreds Gather Near Martinez
to Witness the Simple
Ceremony.
Home and Employment Offered to Un
fortunates Who Would Lead
a Better Life.
MARTINEZ, Cal., Nov. 15.â Convicts
released from prison, outcasts, the de
graded; men who have b?en sentenced for
the first time to years of servitude and
disgrace behind prison walls and iron
bars, have now a home âa home in which
they can rest In peace; can hide, in their
shame, from the eyes of the merciless
world and work until their crimes have
been forgotten. Then they can again go
out among their fellow-men, and, if they
so will, live upright and honest lives.
In this institution the ex-convict has a
true friend at last ; he has known but few.
Tho Salvation Army is that friend, and
the "Golden Gate" farm, situated in the
picturesque hills near Martinez, is his
home. It was dedicated to-day by Briga
dier Keppel, Adjutant J. R. McFee and a
corps ot Salvationists. It is now ready to
receive those who are willing to accept it
in preference to a life of degradation on
the streets.
Dedication is an unostentations word,
but it meant much yesterday to the little
army which assembled on that convict
farm. "Prisoner, there is salvation for
you," they sang out under the trees, and
that is the rock on which iheir hopes for
the future stand, "Prisoner, there is salva
tion for you."
The dedication was simple but impress
ive. Residents from miles around came
to watch the Salvationists as they sancti
fied the home on bended knees. Prayers
were offered, sacred music was played, and
last of all words of thanks to Him who
gave the Salvationists strength to save.
Rolling hills browned by the sun, or- j
chards with ruddy foliuge preparing for ,
their winter sleep, barren vineyards al- j
most obliterated by masses of tangled I
weeds, a cottage and a warping barn now !
constitute the tarm. An occasional scare
crow, hideous to look upon, stands guard
over a plat of laud where grain or corn at
one time grew, but that was long ago. But
where there is now only chaotic desola
tion, witti the return of spring, under the
I hand of the tillers who have erred and
; wish to reform, fruits and grains will
â  ripen, order will be restored, and if pre
dictions prove true a more contented
: union of mankind will be hard to find.
The best influences will surround tbe
men who la hor to regain the honor they
j had lost. Officers of the Salvation Army
â  will be constantly in charge. One viU
: instruct the men in farming, another
will attend to their spiritual wants. Be
sides all these blessings the farm will be
self-supporting. An account will be kept
lor eacn man. He will receive credit for
the value of his labor, and his supplies
will be furnished at the lowest possible
figure. Men will De trained as orchard
ists, blacksmiths, farmers aud cattle
raisers. All of the hay and grain raised
on the farm will be fed to livestock, not
sold. It will not be many years before
the outcasts' home will reward the army
by paying dividends, which will be used
i again 10 help those suftering.
When the men have shown that their
' character has been re-established, that
they are forging ahead and not slipping
j back into old loose ways, permanent em
! ployruent will be found for them outside
the" farm. When a position is secured lor
one of these men the employer is told the
story of his life, but no one else. The
employe, knowing this, will be more
than usually anxious to lead an honest
I Jiie and gain the confidence of those with
I whom he asscciates.
Many men convicted of crimes have
after leaving the farm succeeded in life,
and the farm offers hope lor them all.
NEWS OF SAN JOSE.
I/Vine-Makers Will Attempt to Maintain
Uniform Rates â Heavy Fruit
Shipments.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Nov. 15.â At a meet
ing of the members of the Winemakers'
Corporation In this city yesterday after
noon it decided cs the sense of the meet
ing that the v.inemakers of this county
will not be satisfied with less than 20 cents
a gallon for 189G wines. There was much
dissatisfaction expressed at the course of

TA COMA'S EX-MAYOR A RIOTER.
Acted Unlawfully When He Caused Work-
men to Tear Down Electric Light
Wires.
TACOMA, Wapit., Nov. 15.â The spec
tacular midnight raid upon the electric
light wires of the Commercial Electrin
Light and Power Company last summer
by a force of men under acting Mayor
Angelo Vance Fawcett is recalled by a de
cision of Judge Pritchard in the suit
brought against the city by the company.
In the court's opinion Mayor Fawcett and
his army of electricians were nothing more
than midnight marauders and rioters
against whom criminal proceedings might
properly be brought.
The language and effect of the decision
has caused a sensation In official circles..
On receipt of the intelligence that tbe
court had decided against the city the
City Council last evening passed a resolu
tion directing Mayor Orr to notify the
company to remove its wires from the
city's poles within sixty days. Evidently
the war between the city and its com
petitor in the electric-lighting business is
to continue.
Kver Â«ince the city came into possession
of the plant of the Tacoma Light and
Water Company there has been more or
less friction between the municipality and
the Commercial Electric Light Com
pany. When tha city attempted to cut
rates it was met with an injunction se
cured by the company. Finally Mayor
Fawcett startled the community one sum
mer night by slashing the wires of the
company right and left wherever they oc
cupied cross-arms on the city's poles
where they had been put under contract
and for which rental was paid.
Judge Pritchard's decision says of Faw
cett and his men :
As stated by the Supreme Court of Pennsyl
vania they were merely trespassers and riot
ers, and liable civilly and crimally as such.
We are emphatic upon this point, because we
do not wish to be misunderstood. There is a
growing disposition is this commonwealth, es
pecially upon the part of corporations, private
as well as municipal, to take the law into their
own hands, and settle controversies by force
instead of appealing to courts to redress their
wrongs.
SLEPT ON BARE GROUND.
San Diego National Guardsmen Suffer
Through a Blunder of Officers at
Headquarters.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Nov. 15.â The loyal
spirit of the young men of the National
Guard and ttie Naval Reserves suffered a
severe shock last night when, through the
blunder of the officers at headquarters,
105 men were forced tp lie out all night
without shelter in a bleak and wind-swept
canyon.
The State has never supplied blankets
or overcoats to the men here, and Briga
dier-General Last, ignoring this fact, or
dered the men out for a night and day.
The boys marched to La Mesa Springs,
eleven miles distant, and in garments wet
with perspiration lay down on the bare
ground. Before morning three men were
tafcen to the hospital, suffering from sud
den pleurisy and one was in such dnnger
ou< condition that he was hastily sent
back to tiie city for medical assistance.
Five men gave out on the march, through
exhaustion caused by the exposure; a
number of others were in a fainting con
dition when they arrived at the armory,
but all kept still and implicitly obeyed
orders, maintaining a strict discipline on
the march and in camp. No one was
heard to utter a complaint against the
harsh treatment, but after donning citi
zens' garb a number said they would leave
the National Guard as soon as their terms
of enlistment had expired.

MERCED, Cal , Nov. 15.â The greatest
gathering of dog-lanciers ever seen in
Merced is here to-nigiit. San Jose, Santa
Clara, Santa Cruz, San Francisco, Modesto
and Sacramento are all largely repre
sented, and every one of the lifiy-six dogÃ
entered is ready to go to slips to-morrow.
Excitement over the event is running
higher than at any meeting hitherto held
on these plains, and judging from the
srirhed betting going on it would be diffi
cult to believe that the owners have felt
much of the hard times so continually
spoken of. Bidding ou the favorites was
fast and furious.
Cronin's SKyball is a strong favorite, but
Robinson & Peyton's Flying Buck is
pushing him hard for first honors. J. F.
Grace's Ntilie Conroy is well backeii, as is j
Robinson & Peyton's Master Glenkirk.
Among the Sacramento dogs Stonewall

and P. C. Curtis' Blackette comes in for
support.
Coursing will commence about seven

improved the opportunity. Among tiie
birds bagged by a local Nimrod was a

breed â a cockbini measuring twenty-two
inches from tbe tip of the beak to the end
of the tail and tipping the scales at two
and a half pounds. This is the largest
pheasant ever shot in the province.

a valuable acquisition not only ai a

JAPAN'S BIG SHIP-YARDS.
Will Start Next YÂ«-ar aad Employ 4000
Men.
K. Inaizumi of Tokio, Japanese Govern
ment constructing engineer, now on his
way home, after three years spent in
Europe in studying shipbuilding methods,
arrived at the Pa!ace Hotel yesterday from
tbe East, and will leave here in a few
daj'3 for Seattle, whence he will sail for
Japan on the 20th on one of the steamers
of the new Japanese line.
Speaking of the p reat Government ship
building works, soon to be in operation on
the north coast of the island of Kiushiu in
southern Japan, he said:
"Men have been at work upon the build
ines for about two years, and the contracts
call for the completion and perfection of
the whole plant by the first of the coming
year. The works will then be ready to
produce ships, and the Government will
turn out some very iarue boats there dur
ing the nex: two or three years. How ex
tensive the works are to be may be in
ferred from the number of men that will
eventually be employed-no less than 40 JO
oroOIX). Of course so mcrsy will not be a 1
work at hrst until things get in good run
nine order.
"There are eight piiucipal engineers
and forty sub-engineers, all Japanese, con
nected with the works as Government em
ployee. Mr. Oshima, who recently ar
rived here from Japan and who is si ill
here with a small party of fellow-engineers,
is at the head of the engineering corps.
He is going East to inspect iron and steel
works.
"We want to employ one or two of the
be*t American or German engineers as
consulting engineers to co-operntt with
our force. We shall also employ a num
ber of skilled American machinists as fore
men or workrnasters, to be in charge of
our native mechanics.
"A capital of more than $2,000,000 is in
vested in the works. They are located
risht on the channel that separates the
island of Kiushiu from the main island of
Japan, and through which all the shipping
from Asiatic ports passes on its way to
Yokohama. They are also right on the
edge of Japan's large southern coal fields,
so they are very conveniently situated.
"While I was in Europe I studied in
Germany, England, Belitium, Sweden,
Austria and Prussia during three years,
und then I put in some time in this coun
try In the iron works of Chicago and
Pittsburg."

CURING TUBERCULOSIS.
Report of Profeasor Hir^chfeJder of
Cooper College â Treatment
With Oxytoxiucs.
Dr. J. O. Hirschfelder, professor of clini
cal medicine in Cooper Medical College, has
issued a very interesting provisional report
on the treatment of tuberculosis and other
infectious diseases wish oxytoxines. In
the outset he asserts that it is well proven
by post-mortem examinations that tuber
culosis cures itself; that it may be ac
cepted as a fact that the body possesses
such powers that, under favorab.e condi
tions, an elimination of the disease may
be brought about.
He then dwells on the methods and de
scribes the manufacture of oxytubercuiine
I and directs how it snould be "used. This,
ne says, was used alone for a time, Dut
of late it is employed with oxysep
sine. The liquid, he says, causes no
ereater local disturbance than any indif-
Jerent fluid would produce. Theie is no
reddening of the skin or other sipns of
localized inflammation. In a few minutes
the injected fluid is absorbed and the pa
tient has no further inconvenience, there
is no rise of temperature or any other un
pleasant constitutional effects. Within a
few days the cou^h and the expectoration
diminish and the most striking effect is
the rapid improvement of the patient.
Dr. Hirschfelder cites a number of cases
treated by this method, and describes in
each the symptoms and the improvement
until recovery.
FRENCH HOSPITAL PLANS.
A Letter From A. Goustiaux on the Au
thor of Them.
A. Goustiaux, father of Georges Morin
Goustiaux, the architect, has addressed tho
following communication to The Call:
Pan Franctsco, Nov. 15, 1896
City Editor, Horning (Jail: 1 would be very
grateful to you ii you would publish the ioi
lowing: In different articles concerning the
new French Hospital, published at various
times, the same misstateruent has repeatedly
been rnaae in regard to the plans which wore
awarded the first prize and which were chosen
for the erection of the buildings.
These plans were conceived and draughted
by Georges Morin Goustiaux of Paris, who
sent them Irom that city to aan Frauclsno Mr
Goustiaux, being unable to be present, was
obliged to make arrangements with an archi
tect of our City, who himself had entered in
the competition, but whose plans did not re
ceive any prize.
The conception and creation of the real
plans must be < redited to Georges Morin Gous
tiaux Hlone. Oa this point there can be no
doubi or argument.
The crieinal plaus may be seen at the office
01 tnerremn Mutual Benevolent Society as
well as 111 the album of pho'.oyraplis of plans
submitted by different architects, and they are
meationed in aii the reports of the building
committee.
This is a plain statement of the truth and
cannot be questioned. Neither vanity nor a
disposition to criticize any one leads me to
make sr.ch a statement, but it is a matter of
justice and right.
These same plans are mentioned in the re
port of the Beaux Arts ;n France, among other
works for which said author received prizes
and medals In various competitions. It wouid
therefore be unjust to let it be supposed that
such inscription is false and that Georges
Morin Goustiaux had uttributed to hlmtelf
merit which was not due him. Respectfully
yours, A. Goustiaux. 625 Union street

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, NOVEMBER 16, 1896.
WILL CHOOSE A
NEW PRESIDENT
Interest in the Young Men's
Republican League
Election.
Five of Its Members Have Been
Chosen for Public Oifice
Recently.
The League May Take a a Active Part
in the Coming Municipal
Campaign
Oaklaxd Office Ban Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Nov. 15. }
Tne annual election of officers of the
Young Men's Republican League is to be
held next Thursday and there is a keen
but friendly rivalry among the members
for the honors.
During the recent campaign the Young
Men's League did excellent work and re
ceived very substantial recognition at the
hands of the voters. Although the club
was organized more to exercise an influ
ence on National politics than on local
issues it was prominent in county affairs
and five of its members were elected to
office.
Hart H. North, F. W. Leavitt and Oscar
Breiling, all of whom will sit in tbe next
State Legislature, J. J. Alien, who was re
elected Justice of the Peace, and Charles
Roetn, a Supervisor-elect, were all active
members of the league and owe a large
snare of their success to the efforts of tne
young men.
There are over 250 members in the
league and the office of president is one of
much responsibility. J. W. Stetson, who
was very enthusiastic over the formation
of tbe league, and who, till his resigna
tion, made a vÂ«rv capable president, may
be re-elected. Senry W. Pulcifer and W.
V. Witcher are also candidates, and each
has enough friends to insure a very inter
esting election.
Phil M. Walsh, the present presiding
officer, who conducted the league affairs
during the lively times of the campaign,
nas not so far stated whether he wishes
re-election. He has made a good execu
tive officer, and should he be in the race
for president will add more interest to the
election of next Thursday.
R. F. Crist bas Deen added to the execu
tive committee of the league and J. A.
ban born of Fruitvale has been substituted
for Gus Bray.
Much interest is being shown regarding
the position tbe league will take in the
municipal campaign preceding the elec
tion next March. The Young Men's
League will probably have one or more of
its members on the Republican ticket.
DR. McLEAN SPEAKS.
He May Not Stay Long With the Ply
mouth Church.
OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 15.â The Rev. J.
R. McLean, D.D., president of the Pacific
Theological Seminary and pastor of the
Plymouth-avenue Congregational Church,
when seen to-day regarding the report
that he was soon to present his resigna
tion to the church said: "It has never
been my intention to remain long as pas
tor of the church, but there is no contem
plation of any change during the present
seminary year, and may not be thereafter.
There has been no change of any kind in
our relationship and none is expected at
present."
Tumbled on a Boy's Neck.
OAKLAND. Cal., Nov. 15.â An acci
dent that may prove to be very serious
occurred to-day while Captain Raymus
was giving a diving exhibition at Tayior's
wharf. A man named Joe Comash was
walking on a loose plank on top of a coal
bunker, when it tipped. He was thrown
to the wharf and fell on the neck of a
little boy named Jim McCiosky. The
lad's neck was partially dislocated and
his head was seriously bruised. Comash 's
ankle was smashed and he sustained other
injuries.
Mlhs Fuller Entertained.
OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 15.â Miss Loie

compliment by inviting the petite dancer

FOR LITTLE WAIFS.
A Meeting to Be Held at Mrs. Pettee's
House of AH Interested in Help
ing Them.
Mrs. John Pettee is determined to do all
in her power to help the little waifs left to
the cold mercy of tbe world. She has re
ceived the strong support of the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children,
that for Prevention of Vice and many
kind-hearted people.
Their idea re that the most effective way
of providing for little beings who seem to
have no plac* would be to furnish an emer
gency home. This may be done either in
connection with some public institution
or as a private enterprise, to start in a
rented house in some convenient locality.
The object will require means, and in
order to allow tbe charitably inclined to
discuss the ways and means Mrs. John
Pettee invites all who desire to meet at
her house, 2505 Leavenworth street, next
Wednesday afternoon at 2p. M. Take the
Hyde-street cars and alight at .Bay street.

NATIONAL GUARD
OF CALIFORNIA
Colonel George B. Sperry is no longer
an officer on the staff of Governor
Budd. His resignation was not accepted,
but another officer, Colonel Park Henshaw
of Chico, was commissioned inspector
general of rifle practice. Colonel Sperry
having served the required length of time,
is entitled to be placed on the retired list.
There is one peculiar feature of National
Guard regulations. For example, Captain
Blank, having served a term of years as
company commander, becomes a candi
date for re-election. In the contest he is
defeated and another man elected. Cap
tain Blank is therefore out of the service.
The only plan open for continuation of
his military career is to enlist as a private.
Of course he may apply for retirement if
he has served sufficient length of time to
entitle him to be retired.
Major-General James, division com
mander of the National Guard, recently
received tbe gift of a silver punch bowl of
beautiful design and superb workmanship.
The donors were the former associates of
General James on the staff of Governor
Budd. The bowl beor3 the engraved in
scription, "To Major-General James from
his brother officers on the staff of Gover
nor James H. Budd." The coat of arms
of California is engraved on the bowl.
A number of officers of the National
Guard are forming a riding club. Cap
tains Marco and Eisen are the originators
of the movement. Already excellent ma
terial has been secured and the indications
are that a superb organization of mounted
men will be formed. Colonel H. P. Bush
Is supporting the new military enterprise.
Should the Legislature consent to increase
the number of companies of the guard,
which now seems highly probable, the
new company may be mustered in as
a troop of cavalry.
rii-Kt Brigade.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Nov. 14.â T0-day
Brigadier-General Last, commanding tbe
First Brigade, received from Major-Gen
eral James tbe long-expected emergency
call. The troops responded promptly.
At 3 p. m., six bours after tbe call was is
sued, tbe Seventh Regiment was on the
march. The troops will bivouac to-night
a few miles from El Monte. The Brigade
Signal Corps expects to break the record
for long-distance telegraph work. One
detachment, under the command of Ser
geant KerseyJhas gone to Tehachapi, and
another, under Sergeant Kramer, will
take station in tbe San Bernardino Moun
tains, 120 miles distant.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., Nov. 11.â
Now that the election excitement is over
all interest at the armory is centered in
tbe coming emergency call and tbe team
shoot between Companies G. M and X,
Beventb Regiment, on Thanksgiving day.
The emergency call seems to be the topic
most discussed at the present time, and
the questions asked by tbe boys are both
interesting and amusing.
If the company only had blankets and
overcoats it would be a pleasure to re
spond to the call, but without them it will
be a hardship and no doubt a very trying
campaign for the boys.
On Thanksgiving day teams from Com
pany G, M and X will meet at the' butts in
Riverside for a friendly contest for the
championship of the valley. Each team
will have ten of the best shoes in their re
spective companies, and the team that
carries off the honors will have to make a
record-breaking score.
Ex-Private O. D. Eastwood arrived from
San Francisco last Monday and wiil take
up his residence here again.
Serjeant Carter and Private La Niece
are still in Los Angeles, Privates Thomas
and Guernsey will return to duty with the
company in a few days, having nearly
completed their work on the mountains
for this season.
Sergeant Perry will leave in a few days
for a trip to the borax mines in Death
Valley.
Captain Goff will represent this county
in the Legislature this coming session and
the National Guard will have a true and
earnest friend at court to look after its
interests.
It is reported that Major J. W. F. D ss,
brigade inspector, is an aspirant for Reg
ister of the United States Land Office
under tbe incoming administration.
Major Prescott entertained a few of his
National Guard friends during the ratifica
tion meeting at Redlands last Saturday
evening.
Third Brigade.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Nov. 13. âIn
every department of the National Guard
of this city there is increased activity since
the election has been decided. The boys
are practicing hard in their several de
partments, and especially is this true in
Company G. The members of this com
pany take so much interest that they meet
for drill twice a week, and are improving
rapidly. The presence of several members
of the rrgulararmy in the ranks ("their
terms having expired they have joined
the militia") is an added incentive to the
d*ther members of the company. The rank
and file of Company G are over the aver
age in height and weight, presenting a
hne appearance, and are improving rapid
ly in drill under the efficient tutorage of
Captain Schoemaker and his officers. In
a few days the company intends to go out
on the overflow for a day's practice drill
at the targets and skirmishing. The tar
uet used is the new man target at un
known distances. At the iast field day
held three weeks ago Private Auten car
ried off the honors at the targets, Sergeant
McMartin being second. The company is
anxious to shoot a twenty-tive-man match
with any company in the State, the losing
team to pay for supper, fifty shots to be
fired by each man and mutual arrange
ments to be made as to inspectors.
In Cavalry Troop B, Captain Cook, there
is trtso increased activity, a full meeting
having been held last Wednesday. The
old cannons which were given the troop
have been called in and the new revolvers,
having arrived will be issued in a few days.
The saddles have been thoroughly over
hauled and a complete outfit of meat
pans, haversacks and canteens have been
ordered. The mounted boys are in army
condition for instant active service. On
Wednesday evening next the vacancies
now existing in the non-coms will be
filled and a date selected for a field drill
in pitching camp, stable duty, guard
mount and extended order drilling.
The signal corps iÂ« also hard at work.
Last Sunday it established four flag sta
tions in this City and bad a very successf ull
drill. Tuesday evening was passed in set
tine up heliograph drill and it is the inten
tion of the corps to establish a station at
Aubnrn next Sunday and signal to this
City. The lads are rapidly becoming effi
cient in their telegraph work, and every
evening sonje of them can be found at
their instruments. Great interest is also
being displayed in preparations for their
annual ball, which takes place on Decem
ber 1 and which will be a grand affair.

WOODLAND, Cal., Nov. 13.â Timesare
picking up in military circles since the
election. Last Wednesday evening forty
five men were out for drill. It being ladles'
night the drill was cut snort by the cap
tain in order to let the boys enjoy them
selves. The drill was principally in close
order, with and without guns. Dancing,
singing and recitations followed the drill
until 11 o'clock, when refreshments were
served.
These entertainments are to be given

bility will materialize some time next
month.
Several very necessary improvements
will be commenced in the armory on the
first of next week. A new stone walk is
being put down the entire distance in front
of the armory, and will add very much to
t::e appearance of tne place. The third
social of the winter series will take place
next Thursday evening at the armory
and promises to be more of a success than
the preceding ones.
The social standing of Company P is
firmly established, and the people of tbe
city look forward to its entertainments
very eagerly. The men are still waiting
for some of their superiors to make them
a visit.
MERCED, Cal., Nov. 11.â Sunday, No
vember 8, was the date set for tbe regular
monthly company target practice of Com
pany Hj Sixth Infantry. The day was an
ideal one for shooting, but for some reason
the attendance at the butts was much
smaller than usual. The following mem
bers made scores of thirty and over: Cor
poral Griffith 45, Corporal George 40, Lieu
tenant Smith 40. Sergeant Potter 37, Cap
tain Graham 35, Corporal Smith 35, Cor-
Doral Griffin 34, Sergeant Baker 34, Ser
geant Guthrie 32, Private Kelly 32, Private
Dillian 32. These monthly practices will
be continued during the winter if the
rains will permit.
The company's reading-room is now in
operation and is being made a general
headquarters for the boys at night. Sev
eral magazines and daily and weekly pa
pers have been subscribed for. The good
effects of the plan are already visible in
an aroused interest in company affairs
and military matters in general, through
the impromptu discussion and the remin
iscences of older members that come up
around the stove during the "session."
The probaDle successor to Colonel Nu
nan is also a matter of interest and specu
lation with the enlisted men. They have
no vote in the matter, but are as deeply
interested as the officers in whose bands
the settlement of the succession lies. The
commanding officer can make or spoil a
regiment, and whoever the man may be
the enlisted men desire that he should be,
above all, a soldier, a man of service and
one who has won bis promotion by his
record in the Guard. *
MULTUM IN UNO.
A New Oakland Book With Many Au-
thora Causes a Great Deal
of Talk.
Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,Â£
908 Broadway, Nov. 15. )
Under the joint authorship of many of
the leading divines, business and public
men of Alameda County a book was issued
this week which contains more foundation
for thought than any similar history of
this county that ever left the press. When
Rev. C. W. Wendte, D.D.; Rev. R. F.
Coyle, D.D. ; Rev. E. S. Chapman, D.D. ;
Hon. W. R- Davis, Engineer L. J. Le Conte,
President Fish of the Merchants' Ex
change, Judge Gibson, W. J. Dingee and
others of similar caliber put their Hands
to the plow something is going to be
planted.
With everything that has a tendency to
make a treat city the enigma that has
puzzled residents here for ten years has
been and is. Why is not Oakland a greater
city than she is ?
The book just published answers the
question better than could be done in any
other way. The first glance through the
book suggests the question just asked; a
more careful survey of its pages answers
it. Oakland has suffered in the past from
lack of public spirit, from want of har
mony among those interests which build
up cities and to a large extent from the
close tistedness of a majority of her wealthy
men.
Engineer Le Conte, after covering the
well-Known ground showing how the busi
ness of the harbor has increased, even
with its present limited facilities, says
that the abnormal state of affairs that ex
ists for enabling ships to load and unload
quickly and thus be but a short time idle
in port, can be found nowhere else. "San
Francisco," he says, ''is naturally situated
on the wrong side of the bay, and ali that
Oakland lacks to make her a successful
rival is deep-water channels of sufficient
capacity to accommodate deep sea vessels.
In a few years more this need will be sup
plied, and Oakland will have a fine land
locked, deep-water harbor, free from all
dangers to navigation, ' and completely
sheltered against the heaviest gales from
any point ol the compass."
After dealing with facts and carefully
ignoring fancies. Engineer Le Conte con
cludes thus: "We can safely say that
Oakland is destined to be the Liverpool of
the Pacific Coast."
Dr. Wendte handles the "Men of Wealth
of Oakland" and clearly expresses his
idea of their duty. With the exception of
the Chabot Observatory and the gift of
Mrs. Garcelon for a free hospital he says
nothing has been done by people of wealth
in this city in a public way. Mr. Wendte
declares that endowments of a public
library, a conservatory of music and pub
lic parks are, in the order named, the
best things men of wealth can give to this
city.
"It makes one sad at heart," he says,
"to go out to Mountain View Cemetery
and beho'd the costly but meaningless and
useless structures erected there by family
pride or affection, when a so much nobler
memory is within their reach in the free
public library."
Dr. R. F. Coyle, who came to this coast
from Chicago, says some very trenchant
things about the new Oakland, but he
sums up very clearly in this one para
graph:
Oakland has the elements which will yet
make of it a great city. What it needs to has
ten its greatness is more esprit dv corps.
Every Oaklaiider should talk up bis city; he
should sound its praises, and he certainly can
do it with a good conscience. This is the
spirit that has made Chicago what it is.
Ex-Mayor Davis says that if Oakland is
not a greater city than Omaba ten years
hence it will be solely the fault of her
citizens:
Site may favor, numbers help, commerce
aid, competition contribute, law secure and
improvements count, but we, too, are a iactor
The individual carves his destiny, somewhat.
Alfred B. Nye, managing editor of the
Oakland Enquirer, deals with the manu
facturing industries of the county. He
quotes from tbe United States census of
1890 and gives figures that are doubtless a
surprise to many peopie who have lived
here all their lives.
It is reserved for Dr. E. 8. Chapman to
discover something in which Oakland has
not made any progress. Always witty,
the white-haired pastor concludes a story
on "Ten Years in Oakland" thus:
There is one respect in which I cannot claim
that much progress has been made, and that
is in the matter of health. During the first

five years of our residence in Oakland not one
scholar in my large and flourishing Sunday
school was called away by death. I used every
year to attend many children's funerals in the
East, somejimetj two in one day, often two or
three in one week; but I lived in Oakland,
with its thousands of little folks, for five years
without being once called to minister at a
child's funeral. Almost as infrequent were
the funerals of adults in the prime of life.
Only nine times in six years was the member
ship of my church visited by death, and, with
only one exception, they were all cases of
death caused by accident, or by diseases con
tracted before coming to this coast, or by oid
age. '
Much more is contained in the volume,
bat it 'all tends to adorn the moral.
"Facts and Fieures of Oakland and Ala
meda County" has been written by forty
of the very best representative citizens of
the county. It has been edited by G. W.
Calderwood and G. T. Looibourow and ia
valuable as well as being a work of art.
No higher authorities than its many joint
authors could possibly be found to deal
with their respective subjects, and if their
truthfully expressed ideas and conclusions
stimulate the recent impetus eiven to im
portant developments in this county they
will have rendered a signal service to the
cause of legitimate progress. S. W. B.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL,
Purchase home goods.
Remember California products.
Business like charity should begin at
home.
Charter-making can afford to go slow
for a time.
The revival is rapidly converting the
discontented.
There is evidently a new era of railroad
building in sight.
Third street should be improved by the
time the Coast road is completed.
Advertise your novelties in The Call if
j'ou wish the people to call for them.
Keep your mind on the Assessors' con
vention. Tax reform is a big subject.
Olney has a chance to make a ten-stiike
on the Cuban question before he goes out
of office.
As our miners furnish us with our gold
service they deserve a share of the Cabinet
pudding.
Whatever the gold in tho banks may do,
that in the mountains will have to come
out of its hiding-place.
Working for a living won't be such a
hard struggle for existence in this country
as it has been for the last three years.
If you are looking for a boom you will
be disappointed, but you can count on a
steady improvement ia ail lines of busi
ness.
There will be fewer free soup kitchens
this winter than for several years past, but
there will be more open factories and bet
ter wages.
~*
Although it requires timber to make a
Cabinet, not a single statesman takes to
the woods when Cabinet construction is
talked about.
There will be more commercial travelers
on the road this fall than in any similar
season for the last three years, so be ready
with your orders.
The capital now coming out of hiding
will find no lack of opportunity for profit
able investment. California alone can
take millions of it.
Chicago has just held a convocation of
mothers to consider the training of chil
dren, and there seems to have been no
question of the need of it.
The business revival will give the coun
try all the shaking up it needs in these
days and professional agitators may as
well make up their mouths to be quiet.
Chicago is straining herself to get the
finest theater in the country, and appar
ently for no other reason than to have the
right to call herself "the Paris of Amer
ica."
The prospects of railroad extension are
among the most encouraging features of
the present outlook, and fortunately they
are in sight of almost every section of the
State.
The man who spends any considerable
portion of his time trying to guess the
make-up of McKinley's Cabinet must be a
very eager politician or cisc he has very
liltle to do.
The Canadians are talking of adopting a
nag of their own, and it may be a mani
festation of a desire for independence, but
as the favored design for the banner is
blazoned with a crown it does not look
much line it.
McKinley's victory must be estimated
not by the vote of the Electoral College,
but by ttie vote of the people. His ma
jority in the college will not be unusually
large, but his popular majority was some
thing overwhelming.
Perhaps never Defore in its history was
the world so completely at peace as at
present. Tne only struggle now going on
which can be called a war is that which
Spam is waging against Cuba, and that is
more like a quarrel than a fight.
The largest majority ever given to a can
didate for Congress was that received in
Pennsylvania by Jim Young, the noted
newspaper man, and now political parties
that wish to put up sure winners will
know from what class to take them.
St. Louis is talking of removing; her
famous convention hall to the suburbs for
use as a cattle-show building, and it is
just such treatment of historic structures
that justifies Chicago in mocking at St.
Louis culture. Chicago herself would
have kept the building where it is and
used it as a pork-packing establishment.
If the free-silver Republicans will vote
for a protective tariff and the conservative
Democrats will vote for sound money the
next Senate will have clear sailing before
it, but if the free-trade and free-silver men
can form any sort of combination there is
liabie to be one of the biggest ructions our
august Senators ever presented to the peo
ple.
Mayor Pingree, havine been elected Gov
ernor of Michigan, announces that when
he takes his seat he will propose a system
. of taxation by which corporations will be
made to pay all the State taxes. This
scheme beats the famous potato-patch ex
periment, and when the Assessors' con
vention meets it might be profitable to
communicate with him.
A SECRETARY OF MINES.
The position taken by The Call in sup
port of the resolution of the Miners' As
sociation requesting the appointment of a
Department of Mines by the National
Government to be presided over by an
officer of Cabinet rank has naturally at
tracted no little attention. The subject is
an important one and should be followed
up until the desired official has been ob
tained and due recognition given to the
great industry of our mining men.
The Call intends to follow it up, as is
shown by the interviews published this
morning, and will give to the movement
all the assistance within the power of the
press. No one can question the value of
such an official and me only obstacle that
is likely to be found in the way of bring
ing about the appointment is that of the
natural conservatism of Governments.
This conservatism can be overcome by a
resolute expression of public opinion, and
it will be our object to give that opinion
expression in its fullest and most forcible
form.
Mining is the greatest interest at this
time of that wide region of our Republic
known a3 the Greater West. Different
States have different industries, which in
their localities are not inferior to mining,
but taken as a whole, over the wide area
extending from the Rocky Mountains to
the Pacific Ocean, there is no single indus
try like that which now seeks recognition
in the Cabinet of the Nation.
It is not in its extent only, bow
ever, that the mining industry ranks
as an important one to the Nation.
To a greater degree perhaps than
any other industry engaged in the
production of raw material it in
volves scientific processes and costly
plants. It is furthermore an industry
which is being continuously improved,
ana it is one, therefore, in which thÂ«
American operator should be kept by his
Government thoroughly posted on every
experiment made and every success ac
complished by miners in other countries.
These arguments need no elaboration in
the West. The facts are well understood
throughout all the mining States. Tne
only thing required is that ursing which
will be necessary to rouse the people to
vigorous, united and persistent effort.
Let the membsrs of Conjrress from the
Greater West resolve that among the
things they will achieve in the next Con
gress, or possibly this winter, will be an
act providing for the appointment of a
Secretary of Miies and Mining. Let the
people of all the great mining States
through their officials, their commercial
and industrial associations, through mass
meetings of citizens and through the un
tiring energies of the press, work together
in support of their Congressmen. Unity
of action will attain success.
THE ASSESSORS' CONVENTION.
The Assessors r convention, which has
been called to meet in Sacramento on the
23d of this month for the purpose of de
vising a more equable system of taxation,
is one which should engage the attention
of the people generally. Although it is
Asssssors only who are to meet, never
theless every taxpayer is concerned in
what they will do, and therefore the sub
ject of taxation should be generally dis
cussed in order that the Assessors may go
to the convention with a knowledge of
public sentiment and the public desire on j
the subject.
To devise a scientific system of taxation
is perhaps the most difficult prohiem that
devolves upon a Legislature. It is per
haps for this reason that legislators sel
dom attempt it. There is perhaps not a
country in the worid where a really fair
and impartial system of lewing taxes ex
ists. We cannot hope to Attain such a
system here. But certainly we can, with
the exercise of ordinary sagacity, make
great improvements on the lack of system
and inequities which prevail now.
The question is one which might well
engage the attention of Chambers of Com
merce ar.d Boards of Trade as well as the
Assessors. Many men encaged in those
associations have at various times had
their attention called to defects in our
revenue laws, and not a few of them have
given considerable thought to the subject.
Representations made from such bodies
woul J undoubtedly have weight with the
members of the coming convention, and
might go far to assist them in arriving at
a feasible solution of the problem.
The time for discussing the subject is
short, and it should therefore receive con
sideration at once. If a proper plan can
be devised by the convention there will be
a good prospect of having it adopted by
the Legislature during the coming winter
session. It will be seen therefore that
the time is most propitious for dealing
with the subject.
It is not a mere debating-society topic.
It is not to be treated ideally. It has be
come a question of practical politics, and
must be considered in that light. Let the
taxpayers, Boards of Trade and Chambers
of Commerce therefore eive their earnest
attention to this question and lend the
Assessors all the aid in their power to suc
cessfully accomplish the task they have
undertaken.
THE PACIFIC OCEAN TRADE.
The Chamber of Commerce of this City
has recently addressed two memorials to
Congress relating to the development of
the commerce of the Pacific Ocean. One
of these appealed for action in behalf of
the Pacific Ocean mail steamship service
under the National nag, and the other for
a speedy beginning of the work of con
structing the Nicaragua Canal.
Both of these memorials deserve the full
support not only of the California dele
gation in Congress, but of the entire
people of the State. It is time that San
Francisco and California should begin
seriously to enter upon the great work of
developing our commerce westward and
southward. W T e have reached what may
be called a crisis in the commercial his
tory of the Pacific. England and Japan
are striving for supremacy there, and if
we do not enter into the competition at
once, we may soon fall so far behind in
the race that it will be difficult to make
headway in the future.
The British Government has granted
liberal subsidies for steamship lines start
ing from Vancouver and Australia to
trade between those places and with the
Orient, and the Japanese Government has
entered the field with modern steamships,
cheap labor and large subsidies. These
contestants are neither of them to be des
pised. If our Government sits idle and
leaves everything to individual enterprise,
even the great natural advantages of San
Francisco and other American Pacific
ports may be overcome by onr more active
rivals and the trade of the ocean taken
away from us.
We may expect, of course, considerable
opposition from the Eastern States. Com
paratively few people in that section
understand the already vast and rapidly
growing trade of the Pacific. Our dele
gations to Congress and our Chambers of
Commerce will have to carry out a veri
table campaign of education on this sub
ject. This will require considerable time
and demand the exercise of no little
energy, patience and instruction. It is
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, NOVEMBER 16, 1896.
therefore, as we have said, high time to
set about the task seriously. The Cham
ber of Commerce haÃ done well in sending
tbe memorials to Congress, and it now
devolves upon the press and the people of
the State to back up those memorials by
all the power within their means.
AN EXTRA SESSION.
Tho two subjects of National politics
that now mainly interest tne people are
the composition of the McKinley Cabinet
and the probability of an extra session of
Congress, to he called early in March.
Concerning the first of these, it is useless
to speculate, since the selection of the
Cabinet will depend largely upon the per
sonal choice of the President, and until
he declares his mind nothing positive can
be known about it. The second, however,
is a matter which concerns the public at
large, and the expression of popular senti
ment will have much to do in determining
the decision concerning it.
That there are good reasons against hold
ing an extra session is beyond question,
but, as Shakespeare says, "Good reasons
must perforce give way to better." Judg
ing by the present outlook it appears that
the better reasons are on the side of as
sembling the next Congiess as soon as
President McKinley takes his Beat.
It is true thai there is a fair chance of
passing the Dingley bill at this session of
Congress, and that the bill would probably
give us a tariff which would raise suffi
cient revenues to meet the expenses of the
Government. The gain thus resulting
would be great beyond question. By
putting an end to the deficits in the
National revenues we would remove the
gold reserve from danger, and go far
toward settling some ot the most pressing
of our monetary problems. The people,
however, expect more than that. They
expect a prompt return to a thorough
protective system, and that can be tffected
only by calling the next Congress to as
semble as speedily as the law permits.
The evils of the Wilson-Gorman tariff do
not consist solely in the deficits of Na
tional revenue. They weigh upon every
American industry and interfere with the
extension of American enterprise. The
welfare of American capital and the wages
of American labor depend upon protec
tion. It was for that the people voted as
much as for sound money. They desire
that system restored at once and com
pletely.
The Dingley bill for the purposes of rev
enue may do as a temporary makeshift,
but it will not be adequate to the occa
sion. The pledge of the Republican Na
tional platform was for protection to
American industry, and that pledge will
not be fully kept until the protective sys
tem is made perfect by making it uni
versal.
NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
The two cruisers to be built by Cramps and
the Union Iron Works for Japan will be
of the Yoshino type, built by the Arm
strong Company four years ago. They
will be of 5700 tons displacement and are
to have a speed of 21 knots with
17,000 horse power. Their batteries will con
sist of four 8-ir.ch breech-loading rifles, eight
5-inch rapid-fire guns and a secondary battery
of twelve ti-pounders, four 1-pounder rapid
firing guns and four gatlings. The cost will be
about $1,250,000 for each, and call for com
pletion within two years. Besides these two
cruisers the Armstrongs are to build a dupli
cnte of the Yoshino and two first-class battle
ships. Yarrow will probably build five 150
--ton 24-knot torpedo boats and several torpedo
boat destroyers, anil Normann &. Co. at Havre
are to have five 150-ton torpedo boats. It is
also probable that Shicuan at Klbing, Prussia,
will receive an order for five torpedo boats of
the types given to Yarrow and Normann.
Tho torpedo-boat destroyer Sparrowhawk,
of 240 tons, built by Lsird for the British navy,
madean average speedduring her three hours'
trial of 30.50. At a recent three hours'coal
consumption trial, under thirty-knot speed,
the horsepower was 6000 and the consump
tion 2.49 pounds Welch coal per horsepower
per hour. At this rate, using six and two
thirds tons per hour, her coal supply of sixty
tons would enable the boat to steam 8.1 hours,
or 243 miles, at thirty knots per hour.
The British sloop Dolphin, built in 1882,
hss been attached constantly for twelve years
to the Mediterranean station, and has only
recently b*en ordered home to England for
overhauling and refitting.
The German navy estimates cover an ex
penditure of between $10,000,000 to $12,500,
--000 for completion of ships in hand and the
construction of one armored ship and two
cruisers. A new dock Is to be built at Kiel,
for which $250,000 is required as a beginning.
The present force of the Russian navy
consists of 32,477 men. Including 14 ad
mirals, 265 captains and commanders, 743
commissioned officers, 98 warrant officers, 104.
gunners, 241 navigators, 336 engineers, 5
naval arcnitects, 135 surgeons, 37 chaplains.
168 stewards, 476 naval cadets and 29,850
seamen.
The naval howitzer of 6-inch caliber is being
experimented with in the French navy with
very satisfactory results. The Dragonne, a
torpedo gunboat ot 395 tons, fired five shots
while at anchor and fl"e shots while under
way at a land mark 5200 meters, or three
miles distant. Every one of tho shells fell
within a square of 400 meters, demonstrating
that a fort under such circumstances would be
in a very serious predicament, while on the
other haud tbe craft at a distance of three
miles would present but a very small target
for the guns from the fort.
The tendency of modern war-vessels of the
cruiser type is toward great length. The Power
ful and Terrible, In the British navy, are 538
feet over all with 71 feet beam, and are of
14,200 tons displacement. Of smaller cruisers
eight nre now in course of construction in
England of 11,000 tons, with a length of 435
feet. In France the Jeanne d'Arc, of 11,270
tons, is 496 feet in length, and in Italy a
cruiser of 10,000 tons and 23 knots speed will
be 420 feet in length. In the United States
navy the Minneapolis and Columbia, of practi
cally the same speed as the 11,000 and 10,000
ton cruisers abroad, hnve only 7475 tons dis
placement and are 412 feet in length.

EEET SUGAR INDUSTRY.
AMPLE KOOM FOR EXPANSION THROUGHOUT THE
Country.
Washington Post.
If the per capita consumption of sugar in
the United States at this time were equal to
that of 1892 the aggregate consumption would
be over 4,627,000.000 pounds, and would b3
worth, at an average price of 4 cents, more
than $175,000,000. At the reduced rate of
consumption resulting from hard times the
total for this year will, it is estimated.be
about 4,200,000,000 pounds, worth $168,000,
000. It is entirely practicable to produce in
this country all the sugar required for home
consumption, and by so doing keep at home a
vast amount of money now annually sent
abroad, and to build up a great branch of the
farming industry.
The American Agriculturist shows in notes
gathered from various sources mat great
progress has already been made in the West in
(he manufacture of beet sugar. One of the
Spreckeis factories at Wntsonville, Gal., will
pay out for beets and labor tnisyear not less
than $750,000. During i tie past eight years it
has disbursed over $3,000,000 on the same ac
count, or on an average oi $1000 per day since
it started work, "and has proiected that whole
section from distress during the nard times."
It is stated that this year the mill will handle
not less than 120,000 tons of beeu and it will
be nearly Christinas belore the crop Is har
vested. It is further noted that $150,000 otsh
was pad out in oiie day by tbe lHctory. $120,
--000 of it being for beets aionc. "OverOUO cat
tle are being fed *t tbe creamery, mostly with
beet pulp," and 1 12 C tons of sugar were turned
out as tne i>roduci of about four months' wort.
Coming away from tne i'acitic we find tha
same bu&y industry in the little lownofLehi,
t.';ah, wnere tlic local lactory peid out $37.000
for beets in a single week last month. Up to
October 14 the factory had received 12.000
tons of b.^ets, had worked up 11,000 ton>, "and
had made 17,000 sitrks of refined sugar." 'lhe
lecal paper states ;that 3200 acres nave been
planted m beets this yecr ; that to raise, har
vest and deliver them costs $30 an acre; that
the average crop this season is fifteen tons per
acre, "which at $4 a ton brings $60 an acre,
and therefore nv-ans $30 dear profit per ac?e
to the farmer." On the whole acreage planted
"this means lhat $96,000 clear profit in cash
will be distributed among the farmers this
year" "Tnere is no piace in the world," this
same paper adds, "where the farmers are do
ing better."
We are further informed that the factories
at Grand Island and Norfolk, Nebr., "are ship
ping large quantities of sugar," and "the
new factory in the Pecos Valley of New Mexico
will probably bc^in making .Â«ugar this week."
This industry has been swrted in Wisconsin
and promises well. The Charleston News and
Courier learns that the company which has
been organized to develop the Caihoun Falls
property on the Savannah River contemplates
the introduction of tbe beet-sugar industry
among other important enterprises.
There need be no fear of overdoing the busi
ness, and there are thousands of localities in
the M>uih where It could be carried on with
profit under judicious management. We
know of uu branch of business in any line that
nolds out better promise than tnls to the farm
ers, and the successful prosecution of which
will contribute more directly and powerfully
to National prosperity.
THE CHAMPION OF ITS PARTY.
Berkeley Herald.
As the smoke of battle clears away, we shall
be able, by degrees, to analyze the great vic
tory just won by the Republican party, and to
accord to the different forces and agencies the
praise and glory which are their due.
And when it comes to an award ol party
gratitude for ceaseless vigilance and heroic
endeavor, for tireless energy and most efficient
wort in general the Republicans of Cali
fornia will glacilr give a general meed of grati
tude and praise to the San Francisco Call for
the great battle in which it was the recognized
journalistic champion of the party.
Throughout the late campaignâ from the
hour of McKinley's nomination until nis elec
tion was a known factâ The Call's work, even
to the smallest detail, was thoioughly admir
able. It has gained for the paper new friends
by the thousaads, and the result will be felt
in a manner which shall carry joy to the heart
and McKinley sound money to the pocket of
the publisher.
Henceforth, when you speafc of California's
great Republican newspaper you mention
The Call.

MY SWEECHEARTS
My first was young and very fair,
With bright blue eyes and yellow hair;
A surplice white in church tie wore;
I lovea aim for a month or more.
My Recond, he was gannt and tbin,
All round the hemisphere he'd been;
lied shot at lions, killed a bear:
1 loved him for about a year.
My third had flowing coal-black locks
(I wore tnen Â« re Â«n and yellow frocks),
lie played and sang my heart away;
I loved him oue year and a day.
My fourth was handsome, but so poor!
That only made me love him more;
I wept and slÃbed, but had to part,
it almost, almost broke my heart.
My fifth wasâ well, I cannot say
What be was like: but one fine day
I swore to love him all my life;
And now be calls me "Lluta Wife."
My sixth? My sixth is very small,
lie hardly s ems a man at all:
J til, oh. 1 cou (1 no; be^r to part

REAL ESTATE
MARKET REVIEW
Land Interest Feels the In
fluence of Recuperative
Surroundings.
Rea'ty Outlook Is Favorable As
Compared With Matters
a Year Ago.
School Directors Will Meet Tbh Even
ing to Decide on a Mission High
School Site.
Money is plentiful and there is a disposition
to place more or less of it in City realty. But
buyers do not appear to quickly find the par
ticular investment they are looking for.
Prices, as a rule, are above their views, and
transactions are less numerous In consequence.
Owners feel very much contented at the situa
tion. Real estate agents are of the opinion
that the worst of hard times is over and confi
dence is pretty well restored all round, as is
evidenced by the brisker movement in trade
channels generally. Land necessarily feels
the influence of recuperative surroundings
and trade in the real estate line ought to im
prove in proportion with kindred business en
terprises. Values are not expected to jump in
spasmodic fashion, bat some littlo strength of
property quotations is anticipated by next
spring at least. The outlook is propitious as
compared with matters of a year ago, and it
seems reasonable to view the future of the
rent estate market as promising and encour
aging.
Generally speaking there is no better invest
ment than the purchase of land, if made with
even small amount of care and judgment.
Most certainly there is none safer. Time and
opportunity are also to be considered. Rich
men who constantly ndd to their landed pos
sessions invariably take advantage of a dull
and easy realty market to invest some of their
idle capital. Nerve toinvest when property mat
ters are rather neglected brings out both spec
ulators and investor away ahead on the profit
side sooner or later. The demand for land is
an auxiliary of civilization, and it must be
had to carry out human designs in proportion
as cities increase In population or the area of
fanning operations extend. Natural forces are
almost always working in favor of such condi
tions. In California there is abundant scope
for the building up of orchards and vineyards
and an agricultural population probably sec>
ond in number to few States in the Union can
be comfortably housed on our hillsides and In
our valleys.
In San Francisco the possibilities of building
up an empire City are greater than in almost
any growing town of modern times. It is
hardly possible for a buyer to jro wrong it
malclng an investment on a thoroughfare that
is or can be brought in close contact with busi
ness centers by means of streetcars. San Fran
cisco property is all ripht; it may be under a
cloud at times, but just then ;s the oppor
tune moment to put money Into the real estate
market.

At the meeting of the School Directors on
Saturday, for the purpose of considering the
desirability of various parcels of land that >iÂ«,d
been offered the board for a Mission High
School site, It was quite evident the majority
of the members favored the property at Twen
tieth and Folsom streets. This, they argued,
is the center of the Mission population, and br
reason of streetcar facilities is accessible to
every point of that district. The lot is 200 x
245 feet, and the price is $39,000, being the
cheapest parcel of land that has yet been sub*
muted.
Polk-street property-owners are going in for
improvements on an extensive scale. Only a
short while ago they secured the establish
ment of a number of arc lights along that
thoroughfare, and now they propose to ex
tend the street toward tha bay as far as is de
sirable. The ambition of the merchants and
property-owners is to establish direct commu
nication with the seawall, and the bost means
of doing this, it is said, is to extend Polk street
to Bay street, which is cut through, clear to
tbe grainsheds.

Development Association. The object is to
enhance the desirability of the places named
as suburban residence districts. The work of
the association was somewhat interrupted by
the Presidential campaign, but has now been
renewed with energy.
A considerable number of heavy property
owners have already become members of the
association. Every station along the road Is
represented, and the desire is to acquaint as
many as possible with the objects which the
new organization has in view, and to enlist
their membership to forward those objects.

ALL READY NOW
FOR LAUNCHING
The New Steamer Hum
boldt Built for the
Coasting Trade.
To Take the Place of Her Name
sake Wrecked Over a
Year Ago.
T c N w Craft Will Engage in the
Passenger and Freight Tr ffic Be-
tween This Port and Eur ka.
H. D. Bendixsen. the shipbuilder, at
Eureka on HuiiiboKit Bay, will soon add
another veasci to the coastii:e fleet, mat
ing the fif v from his yard tnis year. The
new vessel, the hull of which will prob
ably be launched on Thursday next, is a
wooden screw steamer built for the Hum
bcldt Steamship Company to replace the
HumboKit, which was wrecked on the
rocka at Poini Gurda in :\ fop earlj on the
rnorninc of September 28, 1895.
The Humboldt was probau:y one of the
best known of the many vessels engaged
in the coastin trade with this port.
Launched on Humboldt Bay October 2,
1875, lor twenty years, lacking only four
days, the steamer continuously and suc
cessfully braved the dangers of Humboldt
bar and the ocean on the route between
this port and Eureka. The stance old
craft, which was acknowledged to be one
of the best bar boats on the coast, also en
joyed the reputation of being one of the
luckiest and most proiitable. She had
experienced more than her share of the
mishaps incident to ocean travel, but
from all had emerged "right side up" and
without the loss of a single life. At one
time coming into port herewith a great
gaping hole in the port bow, received in
collision at sea with the steam coiner
Arago; at another lime coming down
fro^i Humboldt under sail, minus the
rudder and with a disabled propeller,
caused by bumping on the bar, the vessel
nevertheless landed her freight and pas
sengers uninjured. Even in the last mis
hap, which closed her career and laict her
bones on the rocky coast of Southern
Humboldt, the vessel's lucky star was
still dominant, for of the sixty or seventy
people aboard not one was lost or even in
juied.
In view of this excellent record and
possibly with a little of ihe sailor's super
sii;ion in the hope tutu this good fortune
will be perpetuaed in her successor, tne
new vessel will also be namea the Hum
boldt
However, except in name, the new
Humboldt will be as much unlike the old
as is tee Pacific Coast Steamship Com
pany's steamer Pomona, whicti haspl.ed
on tne same route lor years. In fuct the
new steamer, except that it is built of
Humbo.dt pine insiead of iron, will
greatiy reseinole the Pomona in general
appearance and interior arraneenieni. In
comparison of size the new Humbodi
wili liave about 300 tons iess register than
tne Pomona and about 550 tons more than
the oid Humboidt. I lie dimensions of the
new Humboldt are: Length over all '220
feet, beam 31 feei, depth 13.7. gross ton
nage, wnen completed, about 950.
'Ihe model is yacht-like and very pretty,
with a hisrn counter and light stern, and
apparently with every requisite for spec 1.
However, although turning out a very
pretty ves-t -1, the builder has not sacri
liced strength to beauty, and special at
tention has been paid to the requirements
of r good bar bo;it â one that can with
stand the shock of an occasional bump on
the shitting sands.
The machinery for the steamer is now
beinc built at the Fuiton Iron Works in
his City, and is expecied to give t.e ves
sel a speed of 14 knots under natural
draught. In fact, :orced draught will not
be used at all. Th" engines are compound,
with cylinders 22% incnes and 69 inches
in diam< ter, respectively, and with a
stroke of 36 inches. They will be supplied
with steam from two Maxim boilers, each
11 feet 4 inches by 18 feet, giving an indi
cated iiorse-uower of 1400, under a pressure
ot 160 pounds. Besides these there will be
two donkey boilers, each 6 feet by 8 feet,
to operate the steam capstans, forward and
aft, the steam winch at the forward hatch
on the upper deck and other auxiliary
machinery.
In interior arrangement the steamer will
be up 10 date in c-very particular, and will
have accommodations lor 130 passengers.
E.ectr ; city will light the vessel through
out, while a powerful searchlight will be
part of the plant, to enable her to cross
Humboldt bar at nigtit if necessary.
Captain S. Bonnilie:d, formerly in the
steamers Lakme and Farailon, will have
command of the new vessel, and James
Foord, formerly chief-engineer of the old
Humboldt, will fill the same position in
her successor. Both the captain and chief
are stockholders in the new company,
which was recently reincorporated with
the same principal stockholders.
As in the ola company. Richard Sweasy
of Eureka is the managing owner, and
M. Kalish of 400 Front street, this City, is
the resident owner and agent.
It is expected the new Humboldt will
be ready to take her place on the route
about the first ot the year, and to this end
the vessel will be brought here immedi
ate.y after launching to have thÂ» machin
ery put in ami the housings and cabin
work completed. This work will all be
done at the Futon Iron Works at Harbor
View, Mr. Bendixxen, the builder, com in
here to superintend the carpenter and
finishing work.
A cargo of 200,000 feet of redwood lum
ber, principally shingles and shakes, is
now ready at Eureka to put in the unfin
ished hull, and as soon as that is loaded
:he red--tack tug Rescue will ue sent from
here to tow the vessel down. Agent
Kalish will leave on the Pomona to-mor
row to be present at the launching of the
new vessel.
THROWN FROM A CAR
W. H. Denike Narrowly Escapes Being
Crushed Under the Wheels.
. W. H. Denike, who lives at 1114 Powell
street, was thrown from an electric car on
Fillmore street, between Hayes and Grove,
yesterday afternoon, and narrowly escaped
being.crushed under the wheels.
Denike was standing on the front of the
car, with his hand grasping the stanchion.
The conductor insisted that Denike had
not paid his fare and .Denike insisted that
he had. .The car stopped at Hayes street,
and the conductor tried to force Denike
off the car, but he clung to the stanchion
and resisted the conductor's efforts.
The car started down the hill, but had
gone about ten yards when,. Denike says,
the conductor made a rush with both
hai.d- and knocked him off the car. Den
ike fell on his face, just escaping the
wheels, and was rendered unconscious for
several _ minutes. Tne car was stopped
and the conductor returned. Several by
standers who saw the affair abused him
roundly and threatened to report him.
Denike was carried into the grocery on
Hayes and Fillmore, and Dr. Uuckley, who
happened to.be passing," attended him till
the ambulance arrived ; and, took him to
the Receiving Hospital. His right elbow,
face and chin were contused, but it was at
first thought his elbow was broken. 1 The
car was No. 763. . .

take coaches for MountHamiltou, lunching
at Smiih CreeK, and arriving at the Lck
Observatory in time for dinner. There
they will be the guests of Professor B. 8.

HOPE TOO HASTY.
I. uclen Bacigalupi Waa Far From Being
Totally Blind.
The story current in the City of a to
tally blind boy, Lucien Bacigalupi, hav
ing been enabled to s s e by means of the
cathode ray is exaggerated to suc:i an ex
tent as to be apt to excite false hopes
among the blind.
The boy is suffering from partial atrophy
of the optic nerve, but be can see well
enough to tind his way from his father's
place of business, at 949 Market street,
u cross to Berkeley, where he attends
school.
According to his physician he can see a
man ccming along the street and he can
distinguish a larÂ«e pox. The man and box
appsar to him indistinct and s adowy,
but they are quite plain enough to enable
him to go Ground them. On a bright day
he can see where the sidewalk is bounded
by the glass windows.
A physician who examined the boy's
eyes about a year ago says the vision in
his lett eye is so good he can count fingers
as held up before him. His right eye, in
which the nerve is most atrophied, is quite
sensitive to light.
This doctor does not think there is any
thing in the case to encourage hopes of
j the blind seeing by aid of the fluoroscope.
! He says he has a patient ufflicted with
total atrophy of the optic nerve whom he
intends in a few days to have submitted to
a thorough test of the power of the cathode
ray to help the blind.
This test will be conducted by Dr. Philip
Mills J lies, who is an authority on the
.subject to be investigated The results of
ttie experiment will be scientin'caliy accu
rate.
RAN DOWN A BUGGY.
A Mission-Street Klectric Car Rushes
Across Tenth Street With Serious
Results.
He said that the beJl did not ring on the
electric car and this littieoversightcaused
all Hie trouble last night at Mission and
Tenth streets. There was a collision, a
sharp shock, that threw people in the car
off their seats, and then in a second the
air was full of flyinw splinters, bits of har
ness and two younÃ men. There is one
young fellow so sore after the incident
that he cannot move, and so terribly
shocked that his nerves are utterly de
moralized.
Edward Elmon. who lives on Dore street,
near Bryant and Tenth streets, was driving
along Tenth from Market street last night
in a buggy with a friend. Just as they
were crossing Mission street something
struck the bugty with tremendous force.
The blow was sudden ana wholly unloosed
ior.
Elmon and his companion had no time
to th nk. To them tbe collision was like
an explosion. Tney were hurled into the
atmosphere amid crashing and grinding
and general debris. Wnen they carve
back to firm earth Elmon was uncon
scious, but his companion then saw they
had run foul of an electric car.
Elmon was taken to the City and County
Hospital, where Dr. Gunn examined and
treated him for bruises of the lie;id. cli<-st
and body, all of which were exceedingly
painiui, although not of a dangerous na
ture. He said he did not bear the carbeil
and, in fact, did not see the electric car
until it rushed upon them.
DAYS OF DEVOTION.
The Forty-Hours' Adorution Begins at
tÂ»t. James Church In
the Misalun.
The devotion of the forty-hours' adora
tion of the blessed sacrament was c m

rament through the aisles.
This consisted of many little girls in
white witb white veii?, altar boys and
members of the Children of Mary, the
League of the Sacred Heart and the Im
maculate Conception and Young Ladies'
sodalities.
D votions began at 7 p. m. with recital

SHIPS COLLIDE
OFF NORTH BEACH
Gracie S Drags the Revenue
Cutter Rush Over
a Mile.
While Afoul the Tide Carried
Both Swi tly Toward
Destruction.
The Hartley and a Rcdstack Tug to
the Rescueâ Damages to Either
Very Slight.
About 10:30 o'clock Saturday night the
trim pilot-boat Gracie S heaved her
anchor out of the mud off North Beach,
intending to put out through the gates to
see if Bhe could not spy the red and green
lights of a job coming over the dark line
of the night's horizon. Tho tid was at
full ebb and running swiftly. It carried
the Gracie S broadside on down against
the revenue cutter Rusn, which lay within
hailing distance down the stream. The
skipper of the Gracie S saw that a collision
was ahead ana did what he could to avoid
it But the tide and the Gracie S swept
swiftly on until tne little pilot schooner
crashed into the stem of the revenue cut
ter, broadside on. The foul was a badly
mixed one. The jibboom of the Rush
hung over the pilot-boat amidships be
tween her two masts, and tne booms of
the Gracie S's masts ran far back over the
deck of Uncle Sam's white, spick and span
cutter.
The little revenue steamer Hartley,
used by the revenue officers in boarding
ships as they enter port, steamed out and
attempted to haul off the Gracie 6. In the
meantime the latter, witb her broadside
to the tide, caught its full force and car
ried tue Rush with her down the stream,
anchor and all. Both craft were beyond
control, and there was imminent danger
of more collisions with vessels, or of
bringing up somewhere ashore.
The little Hartley was not heavy
enough to pull tue Gracie ti off, and
she put about and ran for the Red
Stack tug office. The tug Joseph fa.
Redmon :, Captain Shaw, went to the res
cue. When off Back Point, after the
fouled vessels had drifted about a mile
and a half, he towed the vessels clear of
each other without carrying anything
away, a feat which is considered good
work along the water front.
The remarkable thing about the fouling
of the vessels is that the injury to either
is scarcely mentionuble. The headstays
of the Rush were slackened up and chaled
a little, and she is minus some of the beau
tiful white complexion on her slem. The
Gracie 8 waa slightly scratched, and after
the accident went out on her cruise. The
Rush steamei back to her anchorage.
The French bark Pierre Corneille, which
collided with the British ship Larnaca in
the stream a few days ago, tied up at the
foot of Folsm street yesterday.
Percy Whitehall, an Engh*h sailor 26
years of age, landed here to got into irou
ble. He was arrested at the Chicago
House yesterday morning for burglary by
Officers Ellis and Hall, and is now locked
up at the Central police station. A hat
and razor in bis possession were identified
by the hotel people.

DOCKERY DENIES
THE CHARGES
Two Dairyman Claim That
Extortion Was At
tempted.
Market Inspector Davis Impli
cated, but It Is Sa:d to Be
Spite Work.
The Accusers Were Arrested by the
Inspectorsâ The Health Officer
Doubts Them.
Milk Inspector James P. Dockery in
dignantly denies the charges preferred
against him and Market Inspector Davis
by Christian Ruhland and Cail Zimmer
mano, proprietors of the Richmond dairy.
According to the accusation, which has
been riled wiih Health Officer Lovelace,
both Dockery and Davis promised the
Richmond dairy immunity from official
examination provided a bribe of $<51X) was
paid by the dairymen, Rubland and Zim
mermann.
Ruhland claims that about a month ago
I. L. Salomon, a cattle-dealer, called at his
dairy and, in the presence of Mrs. Ruh
land and Zimmermann, stated that he
(Salomon) was authorized by Dockery to
make a proposiiion whereby Ruhland
woula be notified of any determination by
the Board of Health to examine his cows.
Six or seven sickly cows were to be taken
to the Richmond dairy by Salomon, and
these would be examined and killed, but
Ruhland's cow* would escape. For this,
Salomon said, $600 should be paid.
The proposition, Rubland states, was
accepted, and lust Monday the first install
ment of $300 was to have been paid at the
corner ol Mission and Third streets.
The story goes on to state that Ruh
land's biotlier George was in the scheme,
and that Zimmermann was selected to pay
the bribe. They made arrangements lo
catch the two inspectors, but according to
the charges Davi3 and Dockery became
frightened on seeing two men present and
dropped negotiations.
Dr. Lovelace, the Health officer, says
that the whole affair is simply revenge.
He does not place any faith in it. He
said: "Accompanying '.he charges was an
application from Ruhland for appoint
ment as milk inspector; also a longar icle
on what Ruhland t rmed hisviewson the
proper manner of inspecting milk. This
resembied very closely toe vaporing of a
weak-minded person, as it was unintelli
gible and senseless."
The doctor added that neither he nor
members of the Board of Health be.iev' d
the charges. On the contrary, he was of
the opinion that the trouble wae caused
by the arrest of Ruhland a few months
ago on a charge of selling impure milk.
"I am anxious," said Dockery yester
day, "to have an immediate ana public
investigation of these charges. As far as
my movements of the past week are con
cerned I can account for them 10 t c sat
isfaction of everybody, but I cannot go
into p irticulars now, as that would give
away my hand to those fellows. 1 shall
do bo at tie investigation, and shall then
prove not only to the satisfaction of the
Board of Health, but to the public, that
the charges are malicious and groundless.
I arrested G orge Ruhiand lasi spring for
bavin bad veal in his possession, oalo
mon wus afterwards arrested on the same
charge, and some calves in his load were

TWO STRANGE CASES OF HYPNOTIC TRANCE
Remarkable Story Told by
Henry T. Clarke of
New Haven.
Since He Kissed His Wife Good-
By Everything Has Been
a Blank.
AN UNINTERRUPTED SLUMBEB.
Hypnotist Kennedy Undertak?s to
Entrance George Cheshire for
an Entire Week.
Henry T. Clarke of New Havan, Coon.,
is under arrest in the City Prison foi em
bezzlement. He tells a most extraordi
nary story of being in a trance for about
seven weeks. During that time ho trav
eled on the cars, ate, slept ana walked
around, and yet he declares be absolutely
knew nothing till yesterday morning iv
the Winchester House on Third street.
On September 26 Treadwell Smith, Su
perintendent of Police of New Haven, sent
a letter to Chief Crowhy that Clarke was
wanted there on a charge of embezzling
$456 in coin and $"20 in checks belonging
to his employers, Peck & Bishop, transfer
freieht and ticket agents, Enion station.
He disappeared and it was believed he had
gone to this City. The letter said further
that Clarke was 3d years of age, 5 feet 11%

inches tall and wÂ». addicted to the cigar- ,
ette habit.
Yesterday afternoon Rev. William C.
Shaw of St. Luke's Church called upon
Captain LÂ»es at police headquarters and
introduced Clarke to the captain. The
clergyman said that Clarke had waited
Upon him that morning and told him of
having found aimself here, but how he got
here or when he had not the slightest recol
lection, and he thought it advisable to
bring him to poliC3 Jiead quarters.
The captain showed Ciarse the letter he
received from Superintendent of Police
Smith, and after Clarke had perused it he
broke down. He said he had no recollec
tion of taking the money or checks, and
the last thing lie remembered wa? kissing
his wife good-by before ht left home for
his office. Since then everything had been
a blank to him till this morning. He said
he was prepared to no back to New Have-.i
without requisition papers.
Captain Lees immediately wired to Su
perintendent Smith tba: Clarke had sur
rendered himself and was willing to re
turn without requisition papers. He was
locked up in the tanks pending ttÂ»e ar
rival of an officer from New Haven.
Ciarke wÂ«Â« been in the City Prison and
was only too anxious to talk. "It is a
fact," he said, "that the last thing I re
member was kissing my wife good-by â
some time in September â before I left
home to go to the office, i remember
nothing more till I awoke in the Winches
ter House this morning. 1 made inquiry
ana found that I had registered on No
vember 3 under the narnÂ« of A. Walter.
"I cannot understand why I registered
under an assumed name. I know a man
by the name of Walker, but his first name
is not A.
"1 have no recollection whatever of tak
ing the money, but I suppose I must have
done so or how could I have got here, as I
had only $1 50 in my pocket when I left
home that morning. I nave two valises
filled with clothes which I must have
boucht, ac I had nothing with me when I
left home.
"I have no checks, and if I took them
also it is a mystery to me what could have
become of them. I have only $3 leit, so I
must have spent all the money except that
amount.

â OVAL BAKING FOWDER CO., NEW-YOWt
the medical college at New Haven, I nearly
lost my eyesight and was laid up with con
gestion of the brain. Since tnen I have
had occasional spells of unconsciousness,
but never anything like this. I ielt it com
in? on for days before and should have
taken to my bed, but I tried 10 overcome
it, and this is the result.
â¢'My wife ha< been a sick woman for
years, and I want to get back to her. I
am afraid my absence hns killed her. I
may have written to her, but I have no
recollection of jioing so. I repeat, that
everything to nre is a blank from tbe time
I kissed my wife good- fry til! I awoke
this morning in the Winchester House.
"As >oon as I recovere i my senses I got
a directory and searched for the Episcopal
churches, as I was a member of the cnoir
in an Ei>:Â«conal church In New Haven. I
went to St. Luke's and inquired for the
rector, hut he was engaged and Mr. Shaw
saw me. I told my story to him and he
brought me to podce headquarters."
Although the story is so improbable
Clarke peiÂ«isted in saying it was true in
every particular.
There were many kinds of fun at the
Bush-street Tneater hist night during
Kennedy's efforts to put Albert Lohner in
a hypnotic trance to last for a week.
Lohner was introduced to the audience
as a single man, aged 47, wlio was willing
to sleep in a glass case a woet if the hyp
notist could develop sufficient power to
perpetuate the slumber lor so long a
period.
Drs. ?. C. Mish and D. Bradley Pivmire
examined Lohner and discovered his
pulse to be at fever heat and his respira
tion on tbe racetrack before Kennedy'^
mcirnetic touch had falieu upon him. The
audience could see, too, that Lohner's
condition was one' of exhilaration.
In spite of the evidences that he bad
taken a good many farewells with friends
betore entering the land of Nod, Kennedy
passed his hands over the subject'^ fore
head and it was but a few minutes until
slumber fastened itself upon him.
He was then raised to tne ceiling in his
glass cage to a point in lull view of the
galleries. After half an hour had passed
in the entertainment t:ie gods in the gal
lery began to cry out that the subject was
awakening and trying to climb out of the
box. He was hastily lowered, roused
from the sleep and dismissed, alter wbich
he wended ills way toward good spirits
again.
Kennedy, however, had anticipated the
denouement and had providea an under
study in the person of George Cheshire of
the Hancock House, wUo was imme
diately put into what tbe doctors pro
nounced a hypnotic trance and raised to
the ceiling in the glass case. He was told
not to wake up until 10 r. m. next Sunday.
The doctors found nis pulse 96 and his
temperature one-fifth of a degree above
normal.
It was announced that the theater
would be open to the public at all hours
from now until next Sunday night.
It is proposed to ailow the subject to
have nothing to eat during the entire pe
riod of the trance. Doctors will be pres
ent at various time? each day to examine
Cheshire and report on his condition.
The hypnotist stated to the audience
that he had often hypnotized subjects for
even a lonter period than that proposed.
During several such tests the subjects lost
from eight to fourteen pounds.
A MORNING ROBBERY.
The Kesnlt of James Walker's Barbary
Coast Trip.
Frank, alias "Piggy" Johnson, John An
derson, John McCann and Mollie Short
were arrested yesterday niorninc in a room
at the Adelphia House on Kearny street.
James Walker complained that he was
beaten and robbed in a room there. John
son and Anderson were charged with rob
bery, McCann with drunkenness, Mollie
Short with vagrancy and Walker with be
ing drunk.
Walker says he came to the City last
Saturday from Burns' ranch, at Staten
Island, where he had been at work for the
last year. He claims to have had $245 on
his person when he landed, and he at once
started out to buy whisky along the Bar
bary Coast. There be met "Piggy" John
son. "Pigey" invited the capitalist from
Staten Island to accompany him to his
room, where they iound Anderson, Mc-
Cann, aiollie Short and another "lady."
As she was sleeping very soundly on the
floor she fr.iled to pree; the visitors.
He says that "Piggy" Johnson threw
him on the bed, CLmked him and de
manded his ruoney. Waiter declined to
surrender his harJ-earned wealth. But
he says bis minri was changed by a blow
on the left eye by "Pigcy." He passed
over $4 50 to Ins friend, who still held him
by the tnroat. Anderson stood with his
back against the closed door so Walker
could not get out. but at a favorable mo
ment,' Piggy" having released the grip
on his windpipe, he sprang from the Ded
and bolted through the door.
He escaped with $210 15 in gold in his
purse. A search of "Piggy" Johnson,
Anderson, McCann and tije short woman
failed to find $4 50, or any portion of that
sun..

The favorite locality in the bay oft Goat
Island for committing suicide attracted
another victim yesterday. When the
Oakland ferry Piedmont, which left this
side of the bay at 10:30 o'clock yesterday
morning, was well out of uer slip and
getting down to the regular treadmill
speed for the other shore, some of the
passengers on the upper deck aft noticed a
man standing near the rail close to the
head of the port stairway. His hands
were in bis pockets and he gazed altern
ately at the water and then around him,
apparently to see if he was observed, but
no particular attention was paid to him at
the time.
When off Goat Island the man suddenly
placed one foot on the rail and leaped
overboard. He feil with a splash and in
slantiy sank out of sight.
Captain Jones stopped the Piedmont as
quickly as possible and a boat was lowered
in double-quick time. In the meantime
the man had reappeared on the surface of
the water, where he seemed to half float
and half sink. The boat was pulled for
him as quickly as possible, but just before
it reached him he flung his hands in the
air and went down. Tbe boat's ciew
waited a few minutes, but the man did
not come to tbe surface again.
His bat of black soft felt, 7U in size, was
recovered and sent to the Harbor police
station.
Captain Jones' description of the man is
that he was about 5 feet 7 or 8 inches tall,
rather slender, pale, and seemed to be
sickly. He wore a light-coloied coat and
dark trousers. Nothing was recoverea by
which he could be identified. Tuere was
no mark of any kind in the bat.
Another victim of the waer yesterday
was Wiliiam Oilman, aged r>2, a resident
of the Spring Valley H%.estead. near
Islais Creek. He went oat to Mussel
Rocks yesterday morning la company
with his friends, T. W. Kaabe, John A.
Boyer and Louis la Porte.
The men gathered in mussels nntil 1
o'clock, at which time all but Oilman pre
pared to- start for home. He, however,
persisted in climbing higher and higher
on the rocks in spite of the rising tide
and thÂ« protests of his friends, who said
be would be iiiceiy to fall if he did not use
more caution.
'Oh, I'm all right." exclaimed the dar
ing mussel-hunter, as he sought the
highest rocks. A moment later he slipped
and fell against a ledge in snch a way as to
j-tun himself. Before lie could be reached
he was rolled heavily by the incoming
breakers, and when bis companions coc
to him he was dead.
The Coroner's deputies had a hard time
to get the body, *o hiph was the tide when
they arrived. Oilman leaves a wife and
four children.
STABBING AFFRAY.
Joseph Kttalita, a Bartender, Danger-
ously Wounded by John Bal
lentjrne, a Carpenter.
John Ballentyne, a carpenter employed
at the Union Iron Works, was arrested
yesterday morning on tho charge of as
sault to commit murder.
Ballentyne Jives in the Montgomery Ho
tel on Second street, and got drunk yester
day morning. AboutS o'clock he went into
Louis Leftman's saloon on second and Te
hania streets and asked for a drink. Joseph
Estalita, the bartender, refused to give him
liquor, as he was drunk. Ballentyne got
mad and pulling a pocKetknife out of his
pocket stabbed Estalita in tha right side
and ran out of the saloou.
Estalita had some friends in the saloon
and they ran after Ballentyne and gave
him an unmerciful thrashing. Tne police
men were notitied of tbe stabbing and
placed Ballentyne under arrest.
Estahta's wound, although dangerous,
is not considered fatal.

IT IS A WICKED CITY.
Dr. Case Say* Sau Francisco Stands
Third in Iniquity.
The Rev. Dr. W. W. Case lectured in the
Howard-street Methodist Church last
night on San Francisco's wickedness. He
compared New York, Chicago and San
Francisco and gave each its comparison
on the scale of its wickedness. San Fran
cisco ranked third in depravity.
This condition he attributed to two
causes â first, the influx of foreign immi
gration, and second, to the saloons, which
ne likened unto "heil holes," "sinks of
infamy" and "breeding nests of infamy."
The consumption of beer in Germany,
lie said, is one barrel a year .'or each man,
woman and child in tbe empire. Great
Britain came next and the United States
next. In San Francisco there are 10,000
men engaged in the making and handling
of beer, and to support those the laboring
men were toiling day and night and at
the same time depriving their families of
their rights.
The remedy lay in starting a crusade
against this bevera.ee. and the only way to
successfully accoffiplish this end was for
every man to sign a pledge against the use
of all intoxicating liquors.
Dr. Case proposed starting such a move
ment right in his church in the near
future.
TEN-CENT BATHS.
The tick Trustees Will Endure Criti
cismâMr. WiUon Talks.
The recent action of the Lick trustees,
whereby a fee of 10 cents will in future be
charged for towels at the James Lick
baths on Tenth street, has, it is under
stood, excited the indignation of several
trades and labor organizations in this
City, but in face of the cold lacts of the
case the board has determined to bear
criticism with philosophic resignation.
As James K. Wilson said yesterday:
"There is nothing else to be done. We
must either impose this charge or shut
down altogether. Personally I only be
came a meniler of the board recently, but
even my own brief experience lias more
than satisfied me, and for my part 1 am
quite willing to quit il anybody else can
be found capable of handling tha trust
better than the trustees."

Daniel Joseph Crowley died Saturday morn
ing Â«i his residence, 797 Mission street, of
pneumonia, contracted during the election.
He was born in this Cityabout forty years ago.

W., and was one of the organizers and finan
cial secretary of the Howard Club, a member

nia, a memDer oi most of the conventious of

ving a six months' sentence for petty larceny,

THERE IS TO BE
SOME FIGHTING
Choynski and Maher Will
Open the Carnival
To-Night.
Jack McAuliffe Is Not Training
Faithfully to Meet
Carroll.
"Sailor" Brown Has Returned From
Japan and Says He Once De
feated Tom Sharkey.
The pugilists seem to be getting into a
cnl de sac, whence they will not be able
to get out without doing some fighting
with their fistb.
The Choynski-Maher affair to-night is
regarded as almost a sure thine that Joe
will conquer Maher. Maher's record
should cause him to be regarded as a pro
spective winner.
The meetinsr between Jimmy Carroll
and Jack McAuliffe next Friday night is
the one toward which the pugilistic world
is looking. The erstwhile lightweights
have grown out of their class and iheir
meeting is to be at eaten weights.
When these men met here at the Cali
fornia Athletic Club some years ago they
put up the best battle ever seen. Mc-
Auliffe b:irely won, and he went back East
ft champion, was introduced to the last
set, and in it he has lived for years.
Though Carroll is not as good as he was,
he has led a steady life. He is train
ing hard to better his wind, and his
chances of winning this time are 40 per
cent better than they were when he met
McAuliffe be'ore, especially that the lat
ter finds it hard to let go his tippling
habit while out bicycling in the morning.
A keen lookout is also being kept on
both Fitzsimmons and Sharkey. These
men are training as hard as they know
how, and Sharkey at least is fit to-day to
enter the ring against any man. As to
Fitzsimmons, he is aiso in good condition,
but he has a couple of weeks yet and he
does not propose to get stale.
Even- minded men are not prone to give
Fitzsimmons the palm. Stiarsey showed
with Corbett that he is not a "man to be
overlooked in any contest. As to his
methods in the rinir, his friends claim be
only fought foul when Corbett introduced
the style.
Fitzsimmons is a known fair fiehter,
but he is also known as a stickler on mice*
He will, no doubt, insist on a good referee
who has a periect knowledge of Queens
beiry. Should sharkey begin wrestling
or rough-and-tumble tactics Fitz will ex
pect the referee to observe the rules re
gardless of the popular sentiment which
is always in lavor of the continuance of a
mill.
The bettinir, while not strong at pres
ent, favors Fitzsimmons. Lanky Bob's
backers depend greatly on the referee
knowing bis business and enforcing the
rules strictly.
Speaking of Sharkey, the sailor, there is
another and well-kuown nautical man in
the held. "Sailor" Brown, who cut and
slashed a wide swath in this City eight
years a.-o as a fighter, is here again. He
claim- he met fought and vanquished
Sharkev at Vallejo in 1889. He refers to
"Baseball" O'Brien, the rc.'eree on that oc
casion, as his proof.
Sharkev, when asked about this affair,
did not know who "Sailor" Brown was.
Subsequently he remembered him ana
laughed.
"Sailor" Brown was defeated in this
City by Young Mitchell in Frank Jones'
club on Stevenson street some years aco.
He was then but a young lad, but he has
grown into weight and cleverness since
that- time. He now wants to get a chance
at either Sharkey or Alec Greggains.
Jack Davis is to have a benefit at the
Excelsior Athletic Club on the 23rt of this
month. On this occasion Ben L<ewis and
Jack King will spar eight rounds. Jce
Sullivan ana Tom Coonev iiave also been
matched for eight round", and Jack Da
vis, the beneficiary, will don the gloves
with VicWueaton for ten rounds.
In each mill there will be a decision.
BEEF FOR SOLDIERS.
The Contractor Mast Deliver 31 eat to
the Commissary Officer â The
. Maneuvers Near Madera.
The fresh beef supplied v under; contract
to the troops stationed at the Presidio is
now delivered 1 to the post commissary,
Lieutenant Leon S. Roudiez. Tbe beef is
no longer cut up by the contractor and de
livered to each company as formerly, but
is cut by the butcher of the pest. The
regulations require this to be done, and it
has been deemed best, to follow the strict
letter of the law in this respect. The con
tractor is Mark Strouse. The contract
price for beef is slightly less than 4 cents
a pound. * .
The post exchange at the Presidio is to
be made more comfortable and inviting.
Additional light will be afforded and
fresh paint will give a touch of bright
ness to thÂ«Â« gloomy interior. When this
work is finished the decorating genius of
the garrison may be requested to turn his
attention to the Presidio Cub. -The rooms
of the club are cozy and attractive, but a
shade somber. ' ' :: 3gBSBJBS&B

Colonel Wiliiston, the post commander
at the Presidio, was told a few days since
that the Chinese were snarinc quail on
the reservation. Diligent inquiry iailed to
verify the report. Coveys of young quail
ara thick on the reservation. The birds
are so tame that they come into the
grounds. The reservation is patrolled
daily to prevent dogs and hunters from
molesting the birds.
The troops recently from Florida and
now at Angel Island, Fort Mason, A!ca

with the change, altnough they find the
warmth of a f-re in the morning quite
agreeable.
HANDBALL COURTS.
Two Great Games Played in Which J.
C. Nealon and Amateur Champion
Donnelly Participate.
The handball courts were Tell patron
ized yesterday, and several interesting and
closely contested games were witnessed.
At the Ban Francisco court two exciting
games were played, in which J. C. Nealon
and P. T. Donnelly, the amateur cham
pion, look part. In the first Nealon and
M. J. Kilgallon played against Donnelly
and E. Maloney and defeated them. Then
Donnelly took as a partner P. Hutchin
son, but he was again defeated. The final
in the first game was won by two aces and
in the latter by one ace. ;
The Union court was open for business
as usual, the proprietors having got over
their temporary difficulty, and several
good games were play The event of
the day was a game in which R. Lenihan,
the ovei hand s wiper, and T. Jordan played
against J. J. Feeney and Al . Pennoyer.
Lenihan and Jordan won the final, after
an exciting contest, by four aces. Terry
McManus, the heavy-weight champion,
was unable to â¢pi ay, as his eyesight has
been bothering him for some time.

The Life of Jesus.
The life of Jesus of Nazareth is being studied
by the Bible class of the First Unitarian
Church under the leadership of Rev. Samuel
Slocombe. At present the class is considering
the latter portion of the "Sermon on the
Mount.'" and yesterday morning the central
point of the discussion seemed 10 be the idea
of the watchful care oi the father of all over
his children. The advice to man was to be
real and sincere in all and seek to learn the
nigher truths and the iesser needs would in
the course of nature be provided.
