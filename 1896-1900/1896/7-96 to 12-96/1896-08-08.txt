DECIDE TO CULL
THE CONVENTION,
Sound - Money Democrats
Will Name Their Own
Nominees.
AGREED IN SHORT ORDER
Provisional Committeemen From
Thirty-Three States Hold
a Conference.
THIRD TICKET IN THE FIELD
Indianapolis Chosen as the Site for
Holding the Rally to Make
the Selections.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Aug. 7.â The
conference of the sound- money Demo
crats fully met the expectations of its pro
moters. There were thirty-three States
represented and about 200 Democrats
from ail over the country were in atten
dance. Though the most famous politi
cians were absent, this fact did not
dampen the ardor or determination of
those present to go ahead and put in the
field a ticket and platform that would
represent what they believed to be the real
tenets of the Democratic party of the
country.
The conference reflected in large measure
the class of Democrats it represented:
that is, the business element. They went
at their work in a business-like way, with
out waste of time. An informal confer
ence was held at noon, which was not
open to the public, the purpose of which
â was to bring into line the members from
Texas, Georgia, Maryland, Pennsylvania
and Maine, who came here with the im
pression that a third ticket would prob
ably do more harm than good by dividing
the sound-money forces of the country.
At~this conference speeches were made
by General Buckner of Kentucky, Mr.
Outhwaite of Ohio, Mr. Wilson of Indi
ana and Mr. Ewing of Illinois, demon
strating the fact that in their States a
third ticket was necessary in order that
tue sound-money Democrats might have
some rallying point, something to fight
for and to make a campaign fur.
The declared that in this section of the
country, where every inch of political
ground* has been fought over year by year,
â .-. racre in a political principle wiOi :
the average voter, ana large numbers of
Democrats, who would be inclined to vote
for a souud-money Democratic ticket,
would swallow Bryan and tbe Chicago
platform eventually, rather than vote the
Republican ticket.
Before the conference at noon ended all
opposition to the calling of another con
vention was withdrawn and it was agreed
that the meetings of the committee in the
afternoon and evening should be public.
It was also informally agreed that General
John M. Palmer of Illinois should be made
permanent chairman of the provisional
committee.
Talks among the delegates exhibited
much confidence in the success of the
sound-money movement. Neal of Georgia
declared that his State contained about
40,000 Democrats who wduld not vote for
Bryan. TyJer, tne Kentucky member, de
clared that the sound-money vote in his
State would run anywhere from 30,000 to
50,000. H. C. Simms of West Virginia de
clared tbat they would poll about 5000
votes for the third ticket.
T. M. Martin of lowa declared that 25
per cent of the Democrats of lowa were for
sound money, and Ellis B. Usher of Wis
consin declared that fulJy 60 per cent of
the Democrats of that State would be
against Bryan. Eugene Hagan of Kansas
expressed the fear that the Bryan ticket
would carry his State. John C. Bullitt of
Pennsylvania, and in fact tne Eastern men
without exception, declared that Bryan
would be overwhelmingly defeated in their
Bum
J. H. Outhwaite of Ohio said there was
not the slightest danger of free silver car
rying his State, and Mr. Ewing of Illinois
declared that while the State was not yet
sale, he did not believe Bryan could carry
it. John E. Semms of Maryland said he
thought a greater number of Maryland
Democrats would repudiate the Chicago
platform than repudiated Gorman in the
election of 1894.
.]. M. Falkner of Alabama expressed the
belief that a sound money ticket would
carry Alabama. .
E. M. W. Cutcheon of Minnesota re
gards that State as doubtful with the sit
uation very much mixed.
At the evening session of the conference
the formal call for the convention was
adopted and a date fixed for September 2.
The laree assembly-room of the Com
mercial Club was packed to the door with
about 300 people at 2:so o'clock. Con
gressman Bynum called the conference to
order, explaining that he did so in the ab
sence of General Bragg, chairman of the
executive committee, who had been de
layed by a washout. He announced that
General Palmer was also on the road and
would arrive shortly. In view of these
facts tbe executive committee had sug
gested that the permanent organization of
the provisional committee be postponed
until tbis evening, at 8:30 o'clock, and
they proceed for the present under the
temporary organization.
Mr. Ewing of Illinois was made tem
porary secretary. A rollcall of States was
taken" and it was found that thirty-three

E. B. Pond of San Francisco, the Cali
fornia committeeman, and Edgar S. Wil
son, the representative of Mississippi, did
not put in an appearance. There was
prolonged applause when Mr. Bynum an
nounced lhat thirty-three States were
represented, cohering the country from
Maine and Florida to Washington and
Texas. No time at all was wasted in de
termining the main question, which had
already been practically decided by a can
vass of the members of the committee.
Mr. Ewing read the resolutions adopted
at the Auditorium conference in Chicago
as authority for the action of the present
gathering. As soon as he finished, Mr.
Outh wane of Ohio moved that a committee
of five be appointed by the chair to pre
pare a call for a National convention to
nominate a Democratic candidate for
President and a Democratic candidate for
Vice- President.
The motion was adopted amid great ap
plause. Even the Texans, who had been
talking for indorsement of the Republican
ticket, raised no objections. Mr. Bynum
named the following committee: J. H.
Outhwaite, Ohio; Charles Tracey, New
York; J. M. Faulkner, Alabama; L. C.
Krauthoff, Missouri; F. W. McCutcheon,
St. Paul.
Tde committee retired at once. The
main question of whether or not a conven
tion should be called having thus been
disposed of, the conference proceeded to
select a location, and in this Indianapolis
won right Gaudily by a vote of 19 against
6 for Memphis and 2 for Louisville.
At the evening session General Tracey
of New York nominated for chairman of
the provisional committee Senator John
M. Palmer of Illinois. The selection was
made by acclamation. General Palmer
made a brief speech, in the course of
which he said:
"It devolves upon us to form the nu
cleus about which the Democratic party
of the country that clings to the principles
of organization may gather, it is our
duty to preserve an organization in order
tbat we may be ready when our erring
brethren see the folly of their ways, and
when God has forgiven them, to receive
them back and reconstruct a united
party."
John R. Wilson of Indianapolis was
made secretary ana John P. Frenzel of
this city treasurer. Mr. Oathwaite, chair
man of the sub-committee, reported tbe
call for the convention as follows:
To the Democrats of the United States: A polit
cal party has always been defined to be an as
sociatiou of voters to promote the success of
political prlncmles held in common. The
Democratic party, during its whole history,
has been pledged to promote the liberty of the
individual, the security of private rights and
property and the supremacy of the law. It
has always insisted upon a safe and stable
money for the people's use.
It has insisted upon the maintenance of the
financial honor of the Nation, as well as upon
the preservation inviolate of the institutions
established by the constitution. These, its
principles, were abandoned by the supposed
representatives of a party at a National con
vention recently assembled at Chicago. The
Democratic party will, therefore, cease to
exist unless it be preserved by the voluntary
action of such of its members as still adhere to
its fundamental principles.
No majority of members of that convention,
however large, had any right or power to sur
render those principle*. Whcq they under
took to do so that assemblage ceased to be a
Democratic convention. The action taken,
the irregular proceedings and the platform
enunciated by that body were and are so ut
terly and indefensibly revolutionary and
constitute such radical departures from the
principles of true Democracy, which should
cnaracterize a sound and patriotic administra
tion of our country's affairs, that its results
are not entitled to the confidence or support of
true Democrats.
For the first time since National parties
were formed there is not before the American
people a piatform declaring the principles of
the Democratic party as recognized and most
courageously and consistently administered
by Jefferson, Jackson and Cleveland, nor are
there nominees for the offices of President and
Vice-President of the United States pledged to
carry those principles into practical effect.
The faithful and true Democrats of the
United States are determined that these prin
ciples shall not be ruthlessly surrendered nor
the people be deprived of an opportunity to
vote for candidates in accord therewith.
Therefore, the National Democratic party of
the United States, through its regularly con
stituted committee, hereby calls a National
convention of that party for the announce
ment of its platform and the nomination of
candidates for the offices of President
and Vice-President and the transaction of
such Dusiness as is incidental thereto, to be
held at Indianapolis on Wednesday, the second
day of September, 1896, at 12 o'clock, noon,
and hereby requests that the members of the
party in the several States who believe in
sound money and the preservation of law and
order, and who are unalterably opposed to the
plauorm and candidate* named at Chicago,
will select ia such manner as to
them ahall seem best a number of
delegates to the same equal to twice the num
ber of electoral votes to which such States are
respectively entitled. Such delegates shall be
duly accredited according to the usages of the
Democratic party. Their credentials shall be
forwarded or delivered to the secretary of this
committee with all convenient speed, and this
committee will make up and announce the
roll of the delegates entitled to participate in
the preliminary organization of the conven
tion.
The reading of this document was
greeted with applause and there was no
doubt it would be adopted without dis
sent. Notliing else was left to be done,
and the gemlemen present indulged in
something of a love-feast in discussing the
report. 0. C. Mumford of Rhode Island
raised tne point that in his Slate tha law
precluded the possibility of the use of tbe
word "Democratic."
Outhwaite said this subject had been

city will occur.
DEATH MET IN A WRECK,
Five Youog Men Lose Their
Lives While Stealing a
Ride to Chicago.
With a Carload of Sheep They Are
Mangled in a Most Shocking
Manner.
DEB MOINES, lowa, Aug. 7.â Five men
were killed in a wreck on the Chicago,
Rock Island and Pacific Railroad at
Leighton this morning. They were all
residents of Dcs Moines, trying to steal a
ride to Chicago.
They are: Wilbur Kuehner, Ed Garry,
Robert Garry, William Shea and an an
known man.
They were all young men out of work and
had boarded a fast freight train bound
eastward, trying to get to Chicago to get
work there.
Just as the train was entering Leighton
an axle broke on the twelftn car from thei
engine. This was a double deck sheep car
and in it tbe men were riding. The car
was thrown across the track and broke in
two. There were nine cars in the rear and
they were piled on top in a fearful wreck.
The tram had been running lorty miles an
hour. The coupling broke on the wrecsed
car and the forward part of the train was
not injured. The five men were crushed
horribly under it. One deck of the car
was loaded with sheep and the men were
thrown in with the sheep and all crushed
to death. Shea had both legs and one arm
broken and has since died.
It was several hours before the wreck
could be so cleared away that the men
could be reached. The "main line of the
Rock Island was blocked and trains were
run around the wreck on other lines.
Brazil* Sovereignty Over Trinidad.

Government of Great Britain has ac
knowledged the sovereignty of Brazil over
the island of Trinidad. This is according
to the award of the Portuguese Govern
ment, whose good offices were accented by
Great Britain and Brazil in the matter in
dispute.
TRAIN-WRECKERS
FOILED AT RENO.
Second Attempt to Ditch
Engine and Cars at a
Culvert.
TIES OJST THE TRACK.
Discovered in Time to Prevent
a Disaster and Possible
Loss of Life.
PROBABLE WORK OF TRAMPS.
Believed to Be Bent on Revenge for
Being Prevented From Stealing
Rides.
RENO, Nev., Aug. 7.â For the second
time within twenty-four hours an attempt
has been made to wreck a train on the
Central Pacific Railroad near this place.
While the excitement over the first at
tempt, detailed in The Call's dispatches
yesterday, was at its height, news of the
second was received. Both were made at
the same place â a culvert on the main
track about a mile west of tbis place. It
is believed that revenge is the motive of
the would-be train-wreckers.
As soon as tbe news of yesterday's nar
rowly averted tragedy reached Reno, offi
cers went to the scene and searched
the neighborhood, but without success.
Word was also sent to the railroad
headquarters at Sacramento. Tbe search
had scarcely been abandoned when word
arrived tbat the wreckers had again placed
obstructions on tbe track. As the freight
train running between Truckee and Reno
reached the spot the engine almost ran
into a lot of loose ties that had been piled
on the track. Fortunately Engineer
Cronin saw them in time and succeeded
in stopping his train before be reached
them. From the way the ties had been
placed on the track it was evident the
train- wreckers had worked very hurriedly,
evidently fearing interruption.
The first attempt was discovered last
nieht, when passenger train 1 reached
the spot. Tbe train was going along at a
lively rate, when tbe engineer saw a big
iron pulley wheel, weighing 1000 pounds,
on the track, right ahead, It lay over and
partly between two of the ties of the cul
vert, and when the engineer saw it he be
lieved tbat a wreck was inevitable. Ha re
versed the engine and succeeded in check
ing the speed of the train, but was not
able to completely stop it
The engine struck the obstruction with
a crash that completely smashed the pilot,
but fortunately the pulley wheel was lifted
out of the hole. Before the train could be
stopped tbe ponderous mass of iron bad
been pushed along the track for several
hundred feet.
An investigation of tbe circumstances
showed that there could be no doubt that
a deliberate attempt at train-wrecking had
been made. The wheel which had been
placed on the track was an old one that
had for at least a year laid alongside of the
track. Whoever was concerned in the crime
had with much labor placed it on the track
and had then rolled it for fully half a mile
to the culvert, where it was found. The
wheel could never have reached the cul
veriTby any conceivable accident. More
over, the way it was p laced in the culvert
precluded any theory of accident, as it had
evidently been placed in a way that the
wrecuers thought would surely derail the
train.
As the wreckers seemed to like that par
ticular cart of the track watchers were
placed there to guard it Railroad Detec
tives W. Brazell and A. Hern of Sacra
mento arrived here early this morning
and took charge of the case. The railroad
officers are greatly excited, and are deter
mined to run down the guilty parties. All
the Reno officers are out looking for clews,
and the railroad detective force will prob
ably be increased during the day.
It is believed that the attempted wreck
ing is the work of tramps, who were put
off the trains, and who have taken this
method of getting revenge. From the
character of the two attempts it seems
hardly likely that robbery could have
been the motive, tor robbers would not at
tempt to derail % switch freight train after
failing to wreck an express train. There
have been a good many tramps ia this
neighborhood of late, and it is probable
that a grand round-up will take place to
ascertain whether any of them can be con
nected with the train-wrecking attempt.
Two men have already been arrested on
suspicion. They were found in the neigh
borhood of the culvert, and not being able
to give a satisfactory account of their
movements were placed in jail. They
have the appearance of being tramps.
They are confined in separate cells, and
the stories they have toid since arrested
do not hang together.
F RE ED BY TEMPE CITASESS.
Two Gypsy Girls Liberated by Force
iron* the Town Jail.
PHCENIX, Ariz , Aug. 7.â Forty lead
ing citizens of Tempe at noon to-day went
in a body to the city jaii and liberated two
gypsy girls, one sentenced a half hour be
fore to fifteen days' imprisonment for us
ing abusive language in the presence of a
half-breed Mexican girl, and the other
awaiting trial for the same offense. The
testimony showed great provocation, as
the daughter of a Deputy Constable had
kicked dust into bread being baked by the
gypsies. ________^__ â
ARIZONA BANDIT CHASE,
A Posse Came Within Rifle
shot of the Nogales
Bank Raiders.
Officers Are Sent to Bull Springs to
Intercept the Fleeing
Outlaws.
NOGALES, Abiz., Aug. 7.â Frank M.
King returned this afternoon from the
pursuit of the bandits who attempted to
rob the International Bank yesterday. .He
left the posse this morning thirty-five
miles from Nogales. It was still on a hot
trail. The posse is now composed of S. F.
Webb, Collector of Customs; C. J. Menan,
Chinese Inspector; Joe Carbon, George
Christ, Captain C. B. Kelton, H. W.
Braciy, Albert P. Behan and six Mexican
gendarmes.
King returned to wire to Bisbee to send
a posse tn Bull Springs, on San Pedro
River, whither the robbers are heading.
There they have mlny friends.
Sheriff Leatherwood arrived to-day
from Tncson with Deputy Doyle, and will
leave with .Deputies Broderick and Doyle
and Mounted Inspectors Webb and Miller
on tbe next train for Bisbee. There they
will take horses to meet the robbers.
Two horses which the robbers were com
pelled to leave at a ranch on Santa Cruz
River fere found to-day. They had be
come exhausted, and their riders stole one
horse from a corral on the ranch and tried
to catch two others in a field. At one
time the posse came in sight of the
bandits, who were about half a mile away,
on a little mesa. King and Carbon, who
were armed with long-range rifles, dis
mounted to shoot, but oo the advice of
their comrades did not. as after a con*
sul tation it was decided that it would only
put the robbers on guard.
That was the last seen of the bandits, as
darkness soon came on. Tbe posse was at
one time only fifteen minutes' ride be
hind them and passed within a few yards
of where they had camped, but it was so
dark that the pursuers could see nothing.
The trail was again taken up early this
morning. Sheriff Leatherwood wirid to
Sheriff Fly of Cochise County to come
from the other side to intercept tht ban

ABBOTT'S DEATH
OH MT, LEFROY.
Hurled From a Crag While
Attempting a Daring
Ascent.
FELL WITH A BOWLDER.
Was Drawing Himself Up Hand
Over Hand When the Rock
Gave Way,
HIS BODY AT LABT RECOVERED
Wrapped in Blankets and Slid Down
the Steep Side of the
Mountain.
VICTORIA, B. C, Aug. 7.-Full particu
lars of Monday's tragedy at the Canadian
National Park, when Philip S. Abbott, as
sistant solicitor of the Wisconsin Central
Railroad, lost his life by falling over a
precipice, were received here to-day. Ab
bott and three other American tourists
left their hotel at Banff on Monday morn
ing fully equipped for a long day's moun
tain climbing. They drove to Lake
Louise, a beamiful resort among the peaks
of the Rockies, about sixteen miles from
Banff.
Taking ropes and other necessary equip
ments, they staited early in the day to
climb one of the highest mountain peaks
in the neighborhood. They reached a
point about 2000 feet above the lake, when
further ascent becoming dangerous, the
four adventurers tied themselves together
with ropes. They climbed another 100
feet until they arrived at a difficult spot,
which It was impossible for tbe four to
pass together. Tbe rope was therefore un
tied, and Abbott, being the best climber,
volunteered to lead the way.
All went well with him for a few yards,
as he cautiously picked his way, inch by
inch, up the steep and pathless declivity.
At last reaching upward to what appeared
to be a solid projecting bowlder, he
grasped it with both hands and had almost
succeeded in pulling himself up when the
rotten bowlder gave way. and, with a cry
of horror, he wildly clutched at the air and
tell into the abyss below. His body
bounded from rock to rock until it was
stopped by a narrow jutting crag, which
w as all tbat prevented a fall of 2000 feet
more.
It took the three survivors four hours to
descend to where tbe body rested. The
ropes having fallen with him they were
compelled to use the utmost care. Abbott
was breathing bat unconscious when they
reached him. An endeavor was made to
bring him down, but he expired in a few
moments, and they were obliged to .tem
porarily leave his body where be died, at
a point over 10,000 feet above sea level.
There it was recovered on Thursday
afternoon, the rescuers being obliged to
wrap it in blankets and let it slide for a
distance of 2000 feet down the mountain
side, it was conveyed with difficulty to
Laggan, whence it will be shipped to Bos*
ton for interment.
The present is the first year sines the
establishment of Canada's National Park
in the heart of the Rockies that peak
climbing has been made the fad by the
many tourists spending midsummer
weeks along the line of the Canadian
Pacific, although Fred Remington and
Julian Ralph as long ago as 1888 scaled
some of the most formidable of the snow
covered peaks.
To-day a telegram from Glacier an
nounces that the summit of Rogers Peak,
the monarch of the hermit range of Sel
kirks, has been reached by the Appalach
ian Club party of Boston, one of whose
members was the unfortunate Abbott.
Both Rogers and Lefroy are very rupged,
and the altitude exceeds even that of the
Swiss peak scaled by Pulzen in 1890.
ELOPE FROM SILVERTON.
Flight and Capture of a Married FTomit*
and a Youth.
OREGON CITY, Or., Aug. 7.â Henry
Bailer and Mrs. Lizzie Froede were
arrested here this evening on a telegram
from Silverton, which said they bad rnn
away with a livery team from Given's
stable of that place. They hired the team
yesterday morning to drive to Salem, the
understanding being that they would re
turn to Silverton the same day. Instead
of returning they came to this city.
When they drove to Noblitt's stable to
put up the team they were identified by
the description tbat had preceded them,
and were at once turned over to a Deputy
Sheriff, who happened to be near.
Bailer is a country boy, 19 years old,
and is apparently enamored of the
woman, who is 30. Tbe woman is the
mother of three children and ncr husband
is a thrifty man who always has well pro
vided for her. It is not believed that Mrs.
Froede will be criminally prosecuted, but
a divorce suit will result.

ORATOR BRYAN IS
EASTWARD BOUND,
Starts on a Campaigning
Tour Through the
States.
TALKS AS HE TRAVELS.
Crowds Turn Out in Sweltering
Weather to Greet the
Candidate.
A LONG SPEECH AT DES MOINES
Declares That the Money Questicn Is
Paramount to All Other
Issnes.
DES MOINES, lowa, Aug. 7.â William
Jennings Bryan ended up seven hours of
campaigning through Nebraska and lowa
at Dcs Moines to-night. His reception
here was a fitting climax to the enthusiasm
with which he had been greeted at a num
ber of other places in this State. The
weather was sweltering during all of the
journey, and from the standpoint of
personal comfort the first day of the
young candidate's progress toward New
York was not the most propitious. The
â¢rowds at stations along tbe route of the
Rock Island road, however, did not seem
to mind tne heat, and gave vent to their
enthusiasm without regard to the height
of tbe temperature.
It was 9:30 o'clock when the train on
which Mr. Bryan was a passenger pulled
into the station here. Attached to its
regular number of coaches were four
special cars containing a large contingent
of free silver men from Dcs Moines â
Democrats, Populists and bolting Repub
licansâand with them was General J. B.
Weaver, who once ran for President him
self. They composed the advance guard
of free silver enthusiasts from this city,
and joined Mr. Bryan at Stuart, fifty miles
west.
More than a thousand people were
gathered at the railway station, and tnese
sweltered and perspired without seeming
to mind it in their efforts to catch a
glimpse of tbe nominee. Carriages were
in waiting, and these carried Mr. and Mrs.
Bryan and the members of the local re
ception committee to the Tabernacle, the
largest hall in the city, accompanied by
hundreds of those who had met Mr. Bryan
at the railway station.
80 great was the crowd in the streets
that the political clubs that had assembled
at tbe station to, escort Mr. Bryan to the
Tabernacle could not form in line, and
were obliged to proceed as best they could
to the scene of the demonstration. To
make progress Mr. Bryan had to propitiate
the people by a few remarks. There was
a blockade most of the way, and several
times the Bryan enthusiasts held up Mr.
Bryan's carriage and tried to get a speech
from him. The crush in front of the Tab
ernacle was tremendous. So solid were
the masses of people packed tbat the car
riages containing the Democratic candi
date's party could not make any progress.
The first carriage contained Governor
Boies, Judge C. C. Cole, president of the
lowa Bimetallic League; Charles O'Don
nell, chairman of the County Democratic
Central Committee, and Mr. Bryan.
Tbe holding-up process was attempted,
and this time Mr. Bryan was obliged to
again yield to the demands of the crowd.
He made a *len minutes' speech and was
wildly cheered. The multitude was satis
fied and allowed him to pass into the big
Tabernacle.
The seating capacity of the Tabernacle
is 4600. To-night not only was every
chair occupied, but the aisles and all
available space were crowded with per
spiring but enthusiastic human beings.
Those who formed the multitude outside
had been unbble^to gain admission. When
Mr. Bryan, escorted by Governor Boies,
appeared on tbe platform, there was a
wild demonstration, closely approaching
that in the Coliseum in Chicago when Mr.
Bryan closed the debate on the platform.
When the tumult was finally quelled
Governor Boies introduced his success
ful yount opponent, and Mr. Bryan
made a ten minutes' speech. He was fre
quently interrupted by cheers, and when
he concluded another outburst came from
the highly enthused gathering. Mr.
Bryan spoke as follows:
Mr. Chairman, Ladies ar.d Gentlemen: I es
teem it a great privilege to be permitted, even
for a brief moment, to stand pefore the citi
zens assembled in this, the capital city of one
of the greatest agricultural States of this
Union. lowa has no reason to blush for the
position that she occupies among her sister
States. It is not necessary for any one to
come from abroad to enlighten you upon the
issues of this campaign.
Your own State is rich in orators and in this
campaign it will be richer than it has been
before in a quarter of a century. [Great cheer
ing.] You nave here that statesman whom
yon delight to honor, and as I look back over
the campaigns in which it has been my privi
lege to take part, there are no campaigns that
1 remember with more of pleasure and of pride
than those two campaigns when at the in
vitation of your people I came to assist in the
election of Horace Boies as Governor of this
State. [Continued applause and cheering.]
If in the National Convention, which has
just closed, the lot fell upon me rather than
upon him it was not because of superior merit,
but because of the circumstances which sur
rounded thai convention, and I do not take to
myself the credit for wnat was done.
I believe tbat those delegates were as honest
and as earnest a body of men as was ever as
sembled in convention, and after viewing the
situation they decided, whether wisely or
foolishly time will tell, that under all the cir
cumstances the nomination should fall on the
one who did receive it, and I am now on my
way to the city of New York to receive the
notification. Ido not know how woll I may
be abie to bear the standard which is to be
placed in my bands, but I know this, thÂ»t
there is not one person in all this land who is
more deeply in earnest in this canse than he
whom you have honored. [Loud applause.]
In this campaign the distinguished gentle
man of whom I have spoken.your ex-Governor,
will go before you as one ot your own leaders,
an<l by his aide will stand that otber gallant
man who for twenty years has fought, and
whether we have agreed with him or not on
all things, there is not an honest man here
but must concede that where he has fought
he has fought with the strength of a giant
[Great applause. 1 And by his side will stand
in this great conflict men who until this year
have been SghtiÃg the battles of the Republi
can party, men wno boast that from the time
of Lincoln until now they have been adher
ents of the Republican party, but who believe
that in this enmpaign the republicanism of
Lincoln finds better expression in the Cnicago
platform than it found in tbe platform adopted
at St. Louis. [Great cheering. J
But we shall not need orators this year. It
every orator you nave known were to be silent,
orators would arise in every county and in
every town and in every precinct of this State
and proclaim the truth. Oiatory sometimes
lias been laughed at, but, my friends, oratory
will be with us as long as the human races,
endures. Whenever there is a cause that stirs
men's hearts there will be orators to present
that cause. Eloquence is simply the speech of
a person who Knows what be is talking about
and believes what he says. Our people in this
campaign not only believe what they say, but
when they tell you that there can be no pros
perity for the people while tbe people fall
down and worship gold as the only standard
money, they know what they are talking about.
They say this is a campaign of education.
Yes; it is a campaign in which the education
haa already gone far enough for us to form
some idea of the results. Sometimes they tell
us that a great many of the newspapers are
against us. lam reminded of what a frieud in
Lincoln said the other day. He said: "It used
to be the newspapers educated tbe people, but
now the people educate the newspapers.'
[Applause and laughter.]
True it is that the people are educated on
this money question. A gentleman said in
Lincoln the other day when he saw the people
gathering upon the streets discussing this
great question. He was from the East, and he
said to a friend ; "Here is a sight you never see
back East." The person answered : "You have
not been back there since the Chicago conven
tion. If you had you would find all over the
East what you find hereâ people meeting and
discussing the money question."
Sometimes our opponents tell us that the
tariff is the issue of the campaign, and that
they will make it such. Whom will they con
sult to do it? Not the politicians. 1 hey must
consult the people; and the money question is
in the campaign, and they cannot take it out
of it. [Loud applause.]
But lam not nere to talk to-night. I am
simply here to express the appreciation which
we feel at this magnificent expression of your
interest in this question. It is no personal af
fair, my friends. You do not care for me.
This is not a matter of individuals'. Any per
son standing on this platform and proclaim
ing the truth in which you believe would be
supported by you with lust as much enthusi
asm. No ; it is not an individual matter.
The enthusiasm shown here and everywhere
simply speaks in tones that will be heard
throughout the Union of the interest which
the people are feeling in the result of this cam
paign. Well may you be interested, because,
my friend-, we have reached a great turning
point in the history of events. Upon the ac
tion of this Nation may depend the action of
the civilized world upon the money question.
And on the action oi this State may depend
the action of this Nation, and on the action of
a single individual here may depend tne ac
tion of this State. Grave are tbe responsibili
ties of citizenship and never more grave than
now. [Great applause] But I can simply ap
peal to you to do your duty as you see it. and
then stand up and take the consequences be
fore your fellow men. [Great and continued
cheering.]
After the speechmakinc Mr. and Mrs.
Bryan went to the Kirkwood House and
retired at once, in order to get a good rest
preparatory to the early start Jor Chicago
in the morning.
CHEERS FOR THE NOWISE E.
Many Brave the Hot Weather to Hear
the Orator.
OMAHA, Nebk., Aug. 7. â Mr. Bryan
and his party reached Omaha over tlie
Rock Island road at 4 o'clock. The trip
was made without incident, except at Al
bright and South Omaha, where crowds
assembled and cheered the nominee. At
the depot here a couple of nundred people
had gathered and with a number of them
Mr. Bryan shook hands. The train re
mained at Omaha fifty minutes, and Mr.
Bryan spent the time about the station.
Before leaving Lincoln Mr. Bryan made a
brief speech, in which he said:*
Ladies and gentlemen: In ordinary times
I would have desired to have the notification
take place at my home, but this is not an or
dinary campaign, and I felt that the cause
should rise above any personal desires we
might have, and therefore expressed the desire
to be notified in New York City that our cause
might be presented first in the heart of what
now seems the enemy's country, but which we
hope to be our country before this campaign is
over. [Great applause and cheering.] I ap
preciate ihe kindness which the neighbors have
suown, and all that I can promise you Is that
whether what I do meets iJHth your approval
or not, I shall do my duty as I see it and ac
cept all consequences which may follow. [En
thusiastic cheering and applause.]
At Atlantic Mr. Bryan spoke as follows:
Ladies and gentlemen: I may during tbe
progress of the campaign have an opportunity
to visit you again and discuss issues as they
are presented at this time. On this occasion I
simply have time to thank you for the com
pliment which you pay, in so far as it ia a
compliment, and to express my appreciation
of the interest which you show. It gratifies
pie to see American people taking an
interest when American interests are at stake.
[Great oheering.] And as I look into
the faces of these people the first thought that
arises in my mind is that these people believe
that the United States is able to have a finan
cial policy of Its ovyn without waiting for the
Aid or consent of any other nation on earth.
[Tremendous cheers. 1 And that ia all I care
to i-ay at this time. When that question is up
there are no other questions until it Is settled.
I thank you lor your attention. [Great cheer
ing.]
Mr. Bryan reached Stuart at 8 :20 o'clock
and was given a hearty receptio^i. Three
hundred people from Dcs Moines, who
had come down in four special cars,
joined the nominee there. Tbe Dcs
Moines contingent was headed by three
committees of reception, one each com
posed of Democrats, Populists and free
silver Republicans. General J. B. Weaver,
the noted Greenbacker, was also one of
the party. Fully 1500 people turned ouc
at Stuart to do the Democratic nominee
honor. The oppressive heat did not inter
fere with the expression of their enthusi
asm. A temporary stand, gaily decorat
ed, had been erected at tbe station, and to
this Mr. Bryan was conducted.
He made a speech that delayed the stop
of the train but tbe four minutes allowed
by the schedule. At one time when he
attempted to end the sp ech there were
cries of "Go on" and "Never mind the
bugs." Tliis reference to the thousands of
gnats which formen a pestiferous halo
around tbe nominee's bead caused great
laughter, and Mr. Bryan, also laughing
good naturediy, went on. His remarks
follow:
Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: It is
a good omen when the people upon whom rest
the responsibilities of government, by such
gatherings as these express the interest which
they feel in the campaign. There is no other
cotntry where the Deople are so free or where
the Government derives its just powers bo
directly from the consent of the govern^!,
and our people have never in any emergency
f.iiled to prove themselves equal to the occa
sion. lam an optimist. I believe not only in
the capacity of tbe people for aelt-gnvernmeni,
but that they will rise to all emergencies. In
the American people, regardless of party,
there is a patriotism which is never appealed
to in vain. [Applause.]
Whether it be peace or war, when duty calls
the people respond and they respond in tuch a
way as to leave no question as to their love
of country and their love of mankind. (Ap
plause.) .
In my judgment no campaign has come be
fore the peoble of this country in lime of
peace since our National history began when
co much depended upon the struggle. I beg
you, as you love your country, to Â»tudy these
questions. It is not for me to tell you bow to
vote. I would be insulting the intelligence of
thefieopie if I attempted to to do so; but I am
only doing my duty when I beg you, first, each
lor yourselves, to find where your duty lies,
and then to do your duty like citizens who
appreciate the responsibilities of government.
(Cheers.)
Parties are but instruments, and when
people say that they own something to a party
let them remember that parties owe higher
duties to the people than people can owe to
parties; and that when any party arrays itself
against tbe interests of the great common
people of this country it forfeits the con
fidence and is undeserving of the support of
any man, no matter to what party he belongs.
[Great cheering.]
But 1 must stop, or 1 will make a speech.
[Cries of "Go on."] There is a paramount issue
in this campaign. I care not whether you be
lieve in free silver or oppose it, you must
agree with me that the money question right
now rises up and overshadows all other ques
tions. We can settle other questions when
this question is settled, but we cannot post
pone the settlement of this question.
When we have decided whether it Is neces
sary for this Government to employ foreign or
domestic syndicates to take care of our affairs
we must settle that question at once or place a
mortgage upon posterity. [Great cheering.]
Now, my friends, all I ask you to do is to
study. They talk about the silyer craze dying
out. They have been burying the silver ques
tion every year for twenty years, [Cheers.)
and it Is more alive to-day than it evÂ«r was be
fore. [Applause.] Why is it they can't bury
it ? Why is it that they may call it any name
they please and yet it riaes and torments them
all the time? Why is it? It Is because this
silver question is based upon the groat princi
ples of justice, and you can't settle any ques
tion until you nettle it rfght, and that we be-
Here is by restoring the gold and sliver stand
ard of the constitution. [Cheers.]

JABBED WITH A BAYONET.
Act of a Militia Picket at Cleveland That
Came Near Precipitating a
Bloody Riot
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Aug. 7.â A riot
was narrowly averted at the corner of St.
Clair and Louis streets this evening. A
number of children in that locality gath
ered and began to annoy the militia
pickets. The latter charged and scattered
the children. Hundreds of people were
passing, returning from work, and several
expostulated with the soldiers. The pickets
then ordered every one off the street.
Edward Nicholas came down the street
with ms wne. He was ordered off the
street, and as be did not move quick
en ongh he was jabbed with a bayonet.
His wife remonstrated and was threatened
with the steel and compelled to flee. A
crowd quickly gathered and threats of
stoning the militiamen were made. Just
as a general row, with probability of
bloodshed seemed imminent, a company
of troops arrived on the'scene, dispersed
tbe crowd and changed the pickets. The
action of tne militia has caused intense
bitterness against them.
BIDS FOR JAPAN'S TRADE
American Manufacturers in the
East See Erilliant Prospects
Before Them.
Visions of Vast Orders for Machinery,
Railway Rolling Stock, Rails
and Cotton-
MENOMINEE, Mich., Aug. 7. â The
Menommee Iron Works have made a for
midable bid on sawmill machinery for par
ties who reside in Japan. The parties
wishing to obtain the machinery sent
word to this city through the Japanese
Consul at Tacoma, Wash., asking the
works to make bids at their regular rates.
The bid calls for a full equipment of saw
mill machinery, with all the modern ap
pliances and improvements for skillfully
sawing lumber.
Tbe letter laid great stress on the fact
that they wanted labor-saving machinery
of the very best quality. The natives are
the only parties interested and they are
pushing the matter with vigor. They
want a big band mill, with its accompany
ing machinery.
BALTIMORE, Md., Aug. 7. â The
chances for American trade with Japan
are increasing greatly. S. H ayawaka, Gov
ernment Inspector of the banks of Japan,
says tbat there is an excellent market for
cotton, corn, iron, petroleum and machin
ery in his country, and by the formation
of Japanese steamshiD companies which
intend to place lines of vessels in service
between the ports of the Pacific Coast and
that country, the Americans will have a
much better chance to compete with the
European manufacturers.
He says tbat companies representing
$60,000,000 capital have recently been or
ganized to construct railroad lines, and
that a great opportunity is afforded to sell
American railway material and rollinz
stock. As yet no railroad equipment of
any kind or rails are made in Japan.
Hayawaka is one of tbe party of Japan
ese officials, which include steamship men
and financiers, who have been traveling
through the United States gathering sta
tistics with a view to increasing trade re
lations between'this country and Japan.
They have become much interested in the
Nicaragua canal project, and believe its
securities would find a ready market in
Japan.
When asked as to the feeling toward
American cotton among the Japanese
manufacturers, Hayawaka said : "From
what I have learned of the cotton produced
in your Southern States I see no reason
why our textile importers should not re
ceive the bulk or their supply from
America. The fabric is especially adapted
for our purposes, and, in my opinion, is
superior to much of that which comes
from the Indian fields. I believe that with
two new steamship lines in operation your
shippers will be enabled to place cotton in
our markets at a price which will enable
them successfully to compete with, the
Indian cotton."
IS NOW "ON THE TURF."
Col/apse of a Chicago Boss Gambler Who
Has Dropped From a Millionaire to
a Home/ess Sport ,
CHICAGO, 111., Aug. 7.â A morning
paper says.: George V. Hankins is "no
longer in the running," as they say of the
brokendown thoroughbred. He is "dead
broke," in the language of Clark street.
He has ceased to be a millionaire, has
given up all thought of owning racehorses
and, in fact, is without a home of bis own.
Tbe man who was once marshal of tLe
famous "Tin Backet Brigade" and the
recognized boss gambler of Chicago, whose
name is familiar to the patrons of every
racetrack in the country, who haa cap
tured hundreds of thousands of dollars
with his Horses, who was one of the chief
founders of the Garfield, Sheffield and
Harlem racetracks, has been frowned upon
by the tickle goddess who smiled so
sweetly and so long at him.
All of Hankins' real estate, with the
improvements thereon, valued at $1,300,
--000, is now in the possession of
Michael C. McDonald, bis former business
associate. Hankins sold out his interests
in the Harlem and Sheffield racetracks
and disposed of his string of horses sev
eral weeks ago. He has nothing left -but
his personal property and a disposition to
mate the best oi his misfortune.
The transfer of Hankins' real estate
holdings was made late yesterday, tbe con
sideration named on the record being the
nominal sum of $1. It includes his ele
gant stone mansion at 1444 Michigan
avenue and real estate in various parts of
the city.
WRIGHT NAMED
FOR GOVERNOR,
Populists of Georgia Fuse
With Prohibitionists
of the State.
WATSON'S WISH HEEDED
Selection of the Young Lawyer
a Defeat for tbe Middle-of
t he- Roadsters.
SOME STRIFE AMONG TIXANS.
Telegrams for Transmission to Otber
State Conventions Stir Up a
Controversy.
ATLANTA, Ga., Aug. 7.â Seaborn Aug
ustus Wright was announced by acclama
tion for Governor by the Populists this
morning. No other name was put up.
The triumph of Wright was a victory for
the Populist-Prohibition fusionists and he
will make tbe race on the issue of prohibi
tion. The defeat of the middle-of-the
roadsters, who opposed extreme declara
tion in favor of prohibition and who were
opposed to going outside of the party for
a candidate, was complete.
Mr. Wright has been an independent in
politics. He is a successful lawyer of
Rome and is comparatively wealthy. He
is 36 years of age and is a magnetic and
brilliant orator. The negroes voted sol
idly for Wright, and C. B. Walton, a
negro leaner of Augusta, pledged the sud
port of 60 per cent of the negroes of
Georgia to Wright. He predicted that all
the white electoral vote of the Republi
cans would drive the negro Republicans to
the Populist ranks. Mr. Wright was
brought before the convention and
made a stirring speech. The State ticket
was completed without contests. Little
interest was taken in naming the other
candidate*. ForComotroJler, General Sea
born B. Bed of Burke was named ; for
Commissioner of Agriculture, W. F, Smith
of Decatur; for Treasurer, W. C. Sibley of
Richmond; for Attorney- General, Donald
Clarke of Chatham. The nomination of
Sibley further emphasized the victory for
the fusionists. He is the leading Prohibi
tionist, but not a Populist, and his wife
i 3 at the head of the W. C. 1. U. in
Georgia.
The platform adopted by the convention
declared for prohibition and indorses the
action of the St. Louis convention. No
action was taken regarding the Vice-Presi
dential muddle. Tne nomination of
Wright was peculiarly the expression of
the wishes of Thomas F. Watson. He
proved himself to be an orator of no mean
ability. W. C. Sibley made his first ap
pearance in a Populistic convention. His
two brothers, both prominent Populists,
were appointed a committee to introduce
him to the convention.
Tbe convention adopted a resolution
authorizing the State committee to nego
tiate with the Democrats for a fusion on
the electoral ticket whenever the Demo*
crats wit.. draw Sewall, but not before.
IN THE TEXAS CONVENTION.
"elegrama in Aiuwrr to Messages of
Greeting Cause Trouble.
GALVESTON, Tex., Aug. 7.â The sen-
sation of the Populist State Convention
was sprung this morning when the com
mittee appointed to formulate telegrams
in answer to messages of greeting from
other Populist conventions reported. The
committee was composed of Barnett Gibbs,
who made tbe speech nominating Kearby ;
''Stump" Ashby, nominee for Lieutenant-
Governor, and Henry Tracy, editor of the
Southern Mercury.
The telegrams they brought in for the
approval of tbe convention were : Reply
ing to the Louisiana convention : "Texas
provides fall electoral ticket and declares
for Watson, then Bryan." Replying to
the Kansas convention: "Texas returns
greetings. Will put a middle-of-the-road
ticket in the field." Replying to the
Georgia convention: "Texas unanimously
indorses Tom Watson and the middle-of
the-road ticket."
The telegrams were received with
cheers.
S. H. Jenkins, chairman of the platform
committee, addressed the convention op
posing the sendine of telegrams, saying
they would be firebrands which would re
sult in the defeat of Populism. He said
he was a middle-of-the-road man at St.
Louis, but bowed to tbe will of that con
vention. Bryan had not been officially
notihed of his nomination, and if this ac
tion should be taken PopuliÃts could
truthfully be accused of insincerity in
their desire for reform.
I* looked as if Jenkins had the conven
tion with him, but when the point of
order was made that nominations were
the order of business the convention re
fused by a big majority to suspend the
rules and allow him to continue his speech.
The matter will not come up again until
the nominations are completed,
Ben Terrell, another prominent leader,
says that if tne telegrams are sent he will
not make a speech during the campaign.
The long session of the convention was
taken up in trying to complete the State
ticket As far as the ticket has been made
up it is as follows: For Governor, Jerome
Â«C. Kearby; for Lieutenant-Governor, H.
S. P. Ashbv; for Attorney-General, W. M.
Yalton; for Comptroller, E. O. MiUner.
DECIDE TO CULL
THE CONVENTION.
Continued from Firtt Page.
considered to some extent, but would have
to be further looked into. Cutcheon, in
an impassioned speech, pleaded for the
use of the old name.
Bullitt of Philadelphia spoke in favor of
the name used in the call. He spoke in
tbe highest terms of President Cleveland,
and his eulogy was received with warm
applause.
Upon the close of Mr. Pullitt's speech
Mr. Outbwaite moved the adoption of the
the call and it was adopted unanimously.
Mr. Outhwaite then moved that the secre
tary be authorized to sign the name of
each member of the committee to the call
and as no objection was made this was
taken by consent.
A resolution was adopted authorizing
the chair to appoint an executive commit
tee of nine to have the general direction
of tbe sound money campaign until the
time of the convention, and have in charge
the preparations for the convention and
act for the National Committee until its
next meeting, which will be held in this
city on September 1.
A second resolution was adopted in
structing tbe executive committee to issue
an address .o the Democrats of the coun
try setting forth fully the reasons for and
purposes of this movement.
There was no fvrther business for the
conference, and a motion to adjourn was
made, but loud calls for Buckner brought
the venerable ex-Governor of Kentucky to
his feet, and he made a brief speech that
carried the crowd by storm. He said in
part:
Mr. Chairman: This Is, I believe, the first
instance in the history of the Democratic
party where it has been r^cessary lor those
who believe in its principfbs to protest against
the usurpation of the majority of so-called
Democrats who have trampled upon their
principles.
We have had examples recently In every
State in this Union, in Kentucky, in Indiana,
and in your State, sir, where tbe rules of just
ice which govern just men in all relations of
life have been denied to the minority, where
powers have been usurped, even by minorities,
and this great Democratic party is threatened
with destruction at the hands of such. We
are here, sir, to protest against these acts of
usurpation.
We have in right, in justice, and as has been
so frequently to-night in the supremacy of
of law and resistance to that mob rule which
would trample law and right and justice
under foot. I, Mr. Chairman, am here from
Kentucky, a participant to some extent in
this great movementâ for it is a great move
ment.
The vofce which you have uttered here to
night and which this committee has uttered
will go forth as a warning to those who would
usurp powers in the interest of individual am
bition, to those who would for the sake of ob
taining personal preferment, trample right
and justice under foot. We expect no victory.
We do not expect to win one electoral vote
for the ticket which we will name. We expect
to meet our Thermopylae as Leonidas and his
Spartan band did, but as in that case our hope
is that the example which we give of fidelity
to principle and patriotism will be the means
of hereafter achieving a glorious Marathon for
the Democracy. [Great applause.]
Several members of the committee also
made brief speeches, and the conference

Twelve Dead and Thirteen
Badly Irjured.
CHRISTIANIA. Norway, Aug. 7.â The
most disastrous fire in many years oc
curred in this city to-day. As a result
twelve lives were lost and almost an equal
number of persons were seriously injured.
The disaster was all due to the burning
of a big gilding factory. Most of those
working in the place escaped, but three
children were unable to get out and per
ished in tbe flames.
An immense crowd of people gathered
in the streets to watch the fire. Suddenly
and without warning one of the walls fell
out into the street directly in the crowd.
Many were buried under masses of hot
bricks' and many were struck by the fall
ing; debris.
Rescuers went to work at once, and in
an incredibly short space of time the
fallen wreckage had been removed.
Then it was found that six persons had
been killed outright and thirteen bad
been badly hurt. The injured were re
moved to the hospitals, wnere three have
since died, making the list of dead twelve.
It is feared that several others are fatally
hurt.
SMOKEHOUSE EXPLOSION.

KANSAS CITY, Mo., Aug. 7.â An ex

packing plant of Swift & Co. here resulted
in the death of one man, the injury of
four others, probably fatally, and in a fire
which destroyed $125,000 worth of prop
erty.
Thomas Hoblowitz, watchman, was
buried under a pile of meat and cremated.
Six others were seriously injured. The
fire started in tne smokehouse about mid
night, but was put out by employes.
Later an unaccountable explosion in the
same house occurred and the building was
immediately enveloped in flames. After
a hard fight tbe fire was got under con
trol at 3 o'clock this morning, but not un
til the building wherein the explosion oc
curred, valued at $50,000, and the stock
therein, worth $75,000, had been consumed.

CRUISERS FOR
JAPAN'S NAVY.
Bids of the Union Iron
Works and the
Cramps.
FRENCH COMPETITION.
Awarding of the Contract Means
Much to American Ship-
Builders.
MILITARY AND NAVAL GOSSIP.
Tbe Intention of Removing Cavahy
Trcops Permamntly Stationed
at tbe Presidio.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Aug. 7.â The
Japanese Government is expected to an
nounce within the next month its award
of contracts for the three cruisers whose
construction it has determined upon. The
bids submitted by tbe Union Iron Works
and the Cramps were classified by the
Board of Japanese Naval Officers which
recently assembled here, and have been
sent to Tokio for the Japanese Govern
ment's action.
In addition it is believed that bids of
French ship-builders on the Japanese
cruisers have been sent to Tokio.
The general belief in Washington is
that tbe contracts for the vessels will be
distributed â one going to the Union Iron
Works, the second to the Cramps and the
third to a French firm.
The matter is a subjrct of considerable
speculation in naval circles and among
shipbuilders, for the placing of contracts
in this country by Japan will mark the
entrance of the United States in tbe naval
ship-building competition of the world.
It is positively denied at army head
quarters that there is any intention of re
moving the cavalry troops which are per
manently stationed at the Presidio and
scattering them at other points alone the
coast. The Presidio is now headquarters
of the Fourth Cavalry, and four troops of
this command are stationed there in addi
tion to six batteries of the Fifth Artillery.
The cavalry force is now in the Yosemite
National Park, guarding it against tres
passing and conducting maneuvers which
were ordered by General Forsyth, under
the instructions sent to him by- Major-
General Miles.
According to tbe report, the cavalry
troops were to be relieved by a force of in
fantry. The only foundation this report
has is probably in a programme which
General Miles recently laid before the War
Department, which contemplates the dis
tribution of the artillery force of the
United States instead of cavalry troops.
General Miles believes that the artillery
regiments should be so distributed as to
be in a position to immediately use the
batteries being erected in case their use
should be necessary. Under the pres
ent arrangement of artillery they are some
distance away in many cases from the
points where the batteries are oeing con
structed.
General Miles has urged upon Secretary
Lamont the establishment of quarters
near these batteries, and when they are
ready there is good reason to believe that
the Fifth Artillery will be widely distrib
uted along the coast. Several batteries
will, of course, remain at the Presidio.
It is possible that tbe batteries when
assigned elsewhere may be relieved by
infantry, but this is a matter of the future.
There is a strong probability that Briga
dier-General Otis, commanding the De
partment of the Columbia, will be ordered
to Chicago to temporarily act as a mem
ber of the important army retiring board,
which will assemble in that city next
Monday.
He will be wanted to replace Major-
General Merritt, who is the president of
the board.
Major-General Merritt has approved the
recommendation made by the post sur
geon at Fort Sheridan that Colonel R. E.
A. Crofton, commanding the Fifteenth In
fantry, be placed on the retired list on ac
count of disability.
Colonel Crofton, it is understood, ob
jects to General Merritt acting as a mem
ber of tbe board to examine him when be
has read the evidence submitted by the
post surgeon and favorably indorses his
re co ra men da t io n.
There is only one other general officer
whom the officials consider available to
take General Merritt's place, in case
Colonel Crofton presses his claim, and that
is General Otis. In case of General Otis'
assignment to tbe board, he will act as a
member, and General Brooks, command
ing the department of Dakota, will act as
pxesident.
There is one officer stationed on the Pa
cific Coast who will appear before tbe
HEW TO-PAT.

The Naval Ordnance Bureau is consid
ering the advisability of malting alt am
munition boxes of tire-proof wood.
Fireproof wood was adopted by the
Navy Department some time ago for all
woodwork in the interior of men-of-war.
Its adoption was the result of exhaustive
tests to which the wood when treated was
eiven It failed to ignite, no matter how
great the intensity of the tiara e applied.
The matter was brought to the atten
tion of the Ordnance Bureau to-day and
the bureau will make some experiments
with a view of determining its value for
use in ammunition boxes. The ammuni
tion boxes now in the magazines of ships
are of ordinary wood and are liable to com
municate flame to their contents in case of
fal This would be prevented, it is claimed,
if fire-proof wood would be employed.
Three naval attaches of the United
States abroad are to be relieved by officers
who will be sent out for that purpose.
The naval attaches are Lieutenant
Charles E. Vreeland, who is stationed at
Berlin, Vienna and Rome; Lieutenant-
Commander R. P. Rodgers, who is ac
credited to St. Petersburg, Paris and
Madrid, and Lieutenant-Commander Wil
liam Cowles, whose headquarters are at
London.
It is understood that Lieutenant A. F.
Niblack will relieve Lieutenant Vreeland,
and Lieutenant Aaron Ward, Lieutenant-
Commander Rodgers. Lieutenant-Com
mander Cowles' relief has not yet been de
termined upon.
This officer has a great deal of Influence,
it is stated, and will undoubtedly make a
strong attempt to remain in his present
station.
The department has evinced no inten
tion of sending an officer to Japan to act
as naval attache at Tokio.

Then Came a Peculiar Exhibition of
â  Pulling " Under the Eyes

COLUMBUS, Ohio, Aug. 7.â John R.
Gentry, the wonderful pacing stallion who
holds the world's record, reduced that
record on the track of the Columbus Driv
ing Association to-day, and established in
connection with previous fast time made
on this track this week a reputation as a
fast track for this course. The track was
recently carefully remeasured by an engi
neer, to set aside charges tbat it was a
short mile, and found to be two feet over
a mile.
It was almost 5 o'clock when Gentry was
brought out for a preliminary warming up
for the attempt to break his own record
and the world's record for pacing stal
lionsâ 2 :o3}Â£. The track was heavy from
the rains of last night, ana it was not gen
erally expected that he would succeed.
HThe other races of the afternoon had,
however, greatly improved the track's
condition.
Two or three miles were paced at a
lively clip, the great crowds cheering
Gentry enthusiastically. They wanted
him to win and he seemed to know it.
Billy Andrews drove him, and when he
was ready for the Btart, John Dickerson,
with his little running horse, went to the
half to pace him in. The second time he
came up to the line Andrews gave the nod
and was away. Down the first quarter he
flew like- an arrow, but the watches
showed that he had consumed :3l}^
in reaching that post. Hope of break
ing the record fell faster as it was
noted that the watches indicated \A&%
when he reached the half. Then the ef
fect of the pacing horse on him began to
show itself, and he made the third quarter
in :29}Â£. Down the homestretch the
horses came like the wind, and it
was evideat that he was pushing
the record very close. Great cheers
went up from the grand stand a:
the magnificent exhibition of speed at the
finish, wbich rose again when the time
was hune out and it was officially an
nounced that Gentry had broken his rec
ord and reduced the world's stailion pac
ing reword from 2:o3}^ to 2:03^.
In the fourth heat of the 2 :20 pace Miss
Jennings, who had won two heats, was
distanced. The action of t c horse was
such as to lead the judges to suspect that
she was held in, and they declared all bets
on the heat off and also all pool beta on
the race.

it was- announced that it would be called

WINNERS AT PETALUMA.
Gallette, Harry Winchester, Plunkett and
Imp. Ivy Beat Their Fields to
the Wire.
PETALUMA, Cal., Aug. 7.â As the
close of the fair approaches there is a
marked increase in the attendance.
The crowd to-day was by long odds the
largest of the week and the betting very
brisk. The . programme s was a'â  long one,
the light-harness brigade rattling off six-*
teen well contested heats, and with a five
furlong running dash lovers of the sport
about had a surfeit. "
The unfinished 2:15 trot, in which much
interest as well as hard coin was wrapped
up, was the i first event called by Starting
Judge McNair. With one heat to her
credit on the day preceding Gallette came
out glossy and fresh and annexed the $400
purse for i her; owner. Jasper Avers still
ruled favorite, but acted rank, and was
never dangerous.
George Washington was the contending
horse in the first heat tiotted to-day, suc
cumbing to the mare by a head in 2:16.
Now selling a prime favorite over the field,
Gallette took the concluding heat and race
after a lively brush at the close with
Chico, who came like a ghost the last fur
long. i_
The event that aroused the most enthu
siasm was the 2:14 pace, captured by game
little Plunkett. The gelding was lame,
which earned for him the sympathy of
the crowd, and the driver, Dan Misner,
was the recipient of quite an ovation at
the finish of the sixth and deciding heat.
After taking two heats. Javelin horrified
her backers by going into the air at the
first turn and having the red flag waved in
her face. : _Â . â¢
The 2:24 trot went to Harry Winchester,
driven by P. W. Hodges, who was also up
behind Gallette, making quite an eventful
day for that clever reinsman. Irvington
Bell went for a record, and the favorite,
imp. Ivy, was first ; past . the wire in the
running affair.
"The announcement was made from ihe
stand during the afternoon that the spe
cial attraction for to-morrow .would be a
mile dash between .the crack pacer W.
Wood (2:07) : and Oscar Osen, the pro
fessional bicyclist. ...
After Irvington Bell, trailed by Bernard,
had traveled around the circle twice, and
taken a mark of 2:14&, the 2:24 trot began
and the coin rolled into the poolbox.
Harry Winchester sold choice at $10, with
Auditor brinsing $3 and the field $7. .
Clovis drew the pole, but was pa?sed on
the first turn by Addison, who took the
heat cleverly from Auditor in 2:2% with
Harvey Mac a good third. "â¢::
The held now sold favorite, with Addison
and Harry -Winchester selling out at $5
each.
In the next heat Addison was passed by
Claudius at the first turn, but again re
eained the lead going to the half, and won
the heat in fine style from Auditor in
2:2o}*. . â â¢ â  â â â â :â â  -â¢ :â : â  1-S--W- â  .â â >
Addison now had the call, but lost the
third heat to Harry Winchester by a short
head in a very exciting drive that set the
crowd wild.
! The next heat was also gathered in by
Winchester, wl,o led his field from the
| word and joggled under the wire ' two
j lengths in advance of Auditor.
Hardly well under way in the fifth heat
the favorite, Harry Winchester, made a
break at the turn, closing several lengths.
Hodges, however, managed -to get â¢ his
horse well to the fore before the half was
reached and fought the beat out with
Niece. Breaking just before the wire was
reached he was placed second for running,
the heat going to the mare.
Niece found egg shells to tread on before
covering a quarter of the distance in the
sixth trot, and goini; to the front the
favorite captured the heat and race easily
with Addison finishing second. **Â«;
||In the final betting Winchester sold a 2
to 1 choice over the field.
â¢ There was some brisk - pooling done on
the 2:14 pace. Javelin brought $10, . Han
ford Medium $6. Allie Cresco $3, Plunkett
$2 and Prince Nutwood $L The favorite,
with Ben Chaboya up on the bike behind
her, took the first two heats cleverly and
it looked all over." â â â¢â ".
' In the third heat she made one of ; her
famed breaks and lost nearly a Quarter of
a mile, finally catching the flag. Prince
Nutwood . took ' this heat, but the " next
j three went to Plunkett in the slow time of
2:19^, 2:19^ and 2:26.
There were seven starters in the five fur
long dash. Imp. Ivy was a hot favorite
at post time and, shaking off Blue Bell in
the stretch, won by a length in 1:01 Sea
side snatched the place from Blue Bell* the
last few jumps. \

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, AUGUST 8, 1896.
THIEDE HINGED
IT SALT LAKE,
Dies Protesting Innocence
of the Murder of
His Wife,
FINDS MANY BELIEVERS
Detective Adam Paul Declares
That the Convict Was Not
Guilty.
OTHER HEN WERE ACCUSED.
Suspicion at One Time Directed to
Two of Kelly's Industrial
Army.
SALT LAKE. Utah, Aug. 7.â Charles
Thiede was banged here to-day for the
murder of his wife over two years ago. He
walked to the scaffold with a steady step,
and when asked by the Sheriff if he bad
anything to say replied with quivering lip
and trembling voice:
"I did not kill my wife. For the last
time on this earth, I pronounce my in
nocence."
The signal was given and the condemned
man was jerked into the air, but bis neck
was not broken and be continued to hang
while shgnt tremors passed over the body.
Fourteen minutes elapsed before he was
pronounced dead by the attending physi
cians.
The execution was private, only the
officers of the law, physicians and repre
sentatives of the press being present.
The crime for which Charles Thiede
paid the death penalty was an atrocious
one. It has been a noted case in the his
tory of Utah, every effort having been
made to save his life.
Thiede kept a saloon at "The Brewery,"
a place which had acquired the name of
being "tough" in more ways than one.
It was some six miles below Salt Lake and
received its sunport from the neighboring
smelters, besides being a favorite resting
place and roadhouse for a certain ele
ment of the city. On the night of April
30, 1894, Mrs. Thiede was found dead near
the saloon. S.:e had been beaten and her
throat was cut from ear to ear.
The circumstantial evidence that con
victed Thiede was the fact that he was
found that night with his hands and
shirt covered with blood.
Kelly's Industrial Army from California
was at that time camped at the deserted,
"haunted" smelter across the way and an
effort was made to shift the responsibility
to two members of the "army." In fact,
at the eleventh hour, only three weeks
ago, a Salt Lake lawyer wrote to Thiede's
sister that he could find the real murder
ers, one of whom he said was in Nevada
and the otner in Nebraska.
Detective Adam Paul of Salt Lake claims
that Thiede was certainly not guilty. His
evidence is based on the testimony of one
Thomas Knight, deceased, who was sand
bagged near the saloon by a man Known
to all the persons interested. He recov
ered from the blow, Â»nd on April 30, 1894,
he met Mrs. Thiede.
She warned him that his life was in
danger, and just then Tbiede and the man
who assaulted Knight stepped out and an
altercation ensued with the woman. That
night she was murdered.
Knight was an expert chemist and the
others had endeavored to get him to be
come the chemist in charge of a "moon
shine" still which they were to establish,
and Thiede's saloon was to be the place
for the distribution of the liquor. De
tective Paul's theory is held by many wbo
were friends of Knight and who heard hia
story direct from him.
Thiede's sister and brother-in-law, in an
affidavit to Governor Wells on behalf of
Thiede, recited these facts and openly
named the man wno was alleged to be the
one who sandbagged Knight and who was
to run the still as one Maxrield, a well
known character on the State road.
Nothing could be proved, however, and
the sentence of Tbiede was carried out.
There is still a doubt in the minds of
many that be was the murderer of his
wife.
A NARC HY IN CRETE.
British and French War Vessels Speed
ing to the Island.
ATHENS, Gbeicb, Aug. 7.âNotwith
standing the silence of some newspaper
correspondents in regard to the true situa
tion at Candia, the principal city of the
Island of Crete, private telegrams received
here are to the effect that anarchy practi
cally reigns there.
The Turks are committing many ex
cesses against the Christians, not even
hesitating at murder. Several Christians
have been killed and a number wounded.
The -epon that the Russian Vice-Consul
had been maltreated is reiterated, and it
is added that a Greek named Sarrns has
also been insulted and roughly handled.
That the situation is critical is evidenced
by the fact that the British warsbip Hood
and the French cruiser Linois, which have
started for Heraklion (Candia), are under
orders to proceed there with all possible
speed.
LONDON, Eng., Aug. 7.-A dispatch
from Athens to the Central News says that
old men and women ana children have
been massacred in HeraJclion and that
several churches have been polluted by
the mob. The cathedral was attacked, but
was nobly defended by the Christians,
who killed many of their assailants.
FROM HIS LIVING TOMB,
The Hypnotized Subject Is Restored to
Consciousness.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Ang. 7.â There
was a continuous stream of people going
to and from Fairview Park to-day to see
J. J. Wyatt, the hypnotized subject, who
has been buried under four feet of ground
smce Tuesday forenoon.
As seen through the glass shaft over the
face he appeared to be dead. When the
body was taken up to-night it was as rigid
as though in death, and all sort of experi
ments in the way of sticking pins'pro
duced no effect.
When tbe hypnotist had restored him to
consciousness Wyatt was provided with
food and ate heartily. To those who ques
tioned he said he knew nothing of what
had transpired since Tuesday until he
found himself seated in the chair under
the pavilion.
Beiurned Three Verdicts.
ATLANTIC CITY, N. J., Aug. 7.â Tbe
Coroner's jury inquiring into the recent
railroad disaster returned three verdicts
to-night. The first stated the manner of
death of the persons over whom the in
quisition was held. The second finds
Engineer Farr, wno was killed in the col
lision, guilty of not following the rules
governing approaches to crossings and
censures the tower man, George Hauser,
for not eiving an express right of way
over an "excursion train and Engineer
Greiner for not using greater care. The
third verdict censured Engineer Farr.

WARRING MATCHMAKERS
Chicago Firm Accused of In
fringing on a French Gov
ernment Patent.
Letter From M. de Watteville Plac
ing the Diamond Company in an
Awkward Plight.
NEW YORK, N. V., Aug. 7.â The fol
lowing letter has been received by the
United and Associated Presses from De
Watteville, who accompanied M. Ricaud,
the French Government technical expert,
who is now examining the Continental
Match Company's new continuous process
machine for the manufacture of matches
at Passaic, N. J., and other processes:
NEW YORK. H. V., Aug. 6.â la reply to Mr.
Barber's cable trom Paris to tnÂ« Moore Broth
ers, Chicago, andfin reply to Mr. Moore's state
ment in one of ihe morning papers. I bee to
say that it has never been denied that a pro
visional contract had been made between M.
Favaloili, director-general of the French State
factories, and Mr. Barber, acting for tbe Dia
mond Match Company, but that tbe sa~id con
tract, when presented to the Frenon Minister
of Finance for bis approval by BE. Favaloili,
was rejected, for the reason that on further in
vestigation by the Government patent expert,
M. Armengea'ud, who was instructed to inves
tigate tbe value of the said patents, it was
found that he could not advise his Govern
ment to close tbe contract, because the claims
made br the Diamond Match Company were
worthless. On receipt of such report from the
Government patent expert it was quite nat
ural that tbe French Minister of Finance
should not give his approval.
1 am sorry that the Diamond Match Com
pany should think it necessary to further try
to hoodwink their shareholders, and beg to
state that not only have I been authorized but
requested by M. Favaloili himself, who signed
the provisional contract, to contradict pub
licly the statement that a definite contract
exists. It is really regretable that the di
rectors of the Diamond Match Company con
tinue to use the name of the French Govern
ment with the above object In view, which, as
a matter of fact, 19 not only without the con
sent of tne French Government but is very an
noying to them, and it looks as though these
statements were put out by the Diamond
Match Company in order to make their share
holders believe that the negotiations on the
Continent of Europe will be successful. Every
business man will however understand that
no one will invest money in a patent which,
according to the report of M. Armengeaud, lias
no intrinsic value.
The Messrs. Moore say thnt they don't care
about tbe coming over of the French experts,
because they claim they hold the French con
tract, but on tbe other hand it is easy to un
derstand that the French Government would
certainly not have sent to America one of its
most reliable engineers In its interests and at
its own expense if a definite contract with
the Diamond Match Company bad really been
closed.
I hope tbat the above facts will be sufficient
to put a stop to tbe erroneous statements tbat
tbe contract between the Diamond Match
Company and the French Government exists,
which I positively deny with the authoriza
tion of the French Ministry. Very truly yours,
Rob E. ds Wattevillk.

SACRAMENTO THEATRICALS.
"AÂ» lou lAkn It" Presented on the
Capital Plaza.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Aug 7.â Out on
the greensward of the Capitol park, be
neath brilliant-hued electric lights, with
stage settings of natural trees, the olden
drama, "As You Like It," by William
Shakespeare, was rendered to-night under
the auspices of the local lodge of Elks.
This was the first outdoor theatrical per
formance ever witnessed in this city, and
the novelty of the affair drew a lar^e audi
ence, fully 2000 people being present. This
was double that expected, and Ed McCabe,
secretary to Governor Budd, offered an
apology on the part of the lodge, saying
that they had all the obtainable chairs of
the city, unless a raid on residences had
been inaugurated. The affair was ex
tremely successful and reflected great
credit on fhe gentlemen of the order of
Elks.

PLANS A BIG VENTURE.
He Is Said to Contemplate the
Erection of a Large
Hotel.
SUMMER AND WINTER RESORT
Negotiations Now Under Way for
an Investment in Valuable
Property.
STOCKTON, Cal., Aug. 7.â There is a
deal on foot looking to the sale of Jack
son's baths, one of the most valuable
properties south of Stockton. Yesterday
the wires were hot between San Francisco
and Stockton with offers from Mayor Su
tro of the Bay City ior the purchase of the
place. For some time it has been known
that R. C. Pierson, the proprietor of the
baths.and until recently a partner of J. H.
Wilkins at the Cliff House, was willing to
sell them if he could get a reasonable
price. Pearson holds a long-term lease of
the grounds, with the privilege of buying
tnem, and has expended since he has had
them some $16,000 in fitting up the place
and making permanent improvements.
Recently Sum Jackson, the owner of the
property, made an attempt to buy Pear
son's interest, but his offer was not high
enough.
On Wednesday Jackson made a trip to
San Francisco, and was in close consulta
tion with Mayor Sutro for some time. As
a result of his trip be came back to Stock
ton with an offer which he made to Pear
son yesterday, but the veteran bath-man
ager did not care to part with his holding?
for the sum named, and so tbe wires were
resorted to to see what more Sutro would
do. Each time a telegram came from San
Francisco it brought a raise of $500.
While it is known that negotiations for
the sale of the property are pending, it is
understood that the deal has not yet been
closed. It was rumored to-day that if
Sutro succeeded in securing the baths, he
would probably buy the Jackson tract
near them, and the property on wnich the
baths are situated. It was also said that
if Sutro carries out his plans he will erect
a comfortable hotel on the property and
make it a popular summer and winter
resort.
Some time ago Pearson intended to erect
a number of cottages on the tract he has
under lease and plant trees about them.
These he proposed to let in the summer
and winter months to persons desirous of
staying near the baths, to avail themselves
of toe medicinal properties in tbe water,
but when he left for San Francisco to open
the new Cliff House this plan was
evidently abandoned.

Co., one of the oldest wholesale boot and
shoe firms in the city, doing business at
196-200 Market street, went under yes
terday afternoon. The failure was the re
sult of a confession of judgment in the
Federal court on notes aggregating
$170,000 in favor of the United States Rub
ber Company and L. Candee & Co. Close
upon this came a confession in tbe Circuit
Court for $25,250 in favor of the Metro

United States Marshal and the Sheriff.
The capital stock of the concern is
$400,000. No accurate statement of the

mate, however, the liabilities will not
reach over $300,000 and tbe assets, lib
erally stated, perhaps $440,000.
A Lumber Company Fails.
DETROIT, Mich., Aug. 7.â The Delta
Lumber Company late this afternoon tiled
a trust mortgage running to Governor
John Erich, a member of the company,
and securing creditors for debts aggregat
ing more than $500,000. The crisis in the
affairs of the company is due to the failure
of James T. Hurst of Wyandotte, who was
indebted to the company; the general
stagnation in the lumber trade and the
fact that several large notes matured at
the same time. Extensions have been
granted to the company, and it will be
"carried" until its assets are available.
The company had a puid-in capital of
$300,000.

WARD CAUCUSES
IN SACRAMENTO,
Capital Republicans Name
County Convention
Delegates.
BATTLE FOE LEADERSHIP
Rhodes Faction Arrayed Against
the Forces of Daroux
and Rider.
EACH CLAIMS A VICTORY.
Parade the Streets and Burden the
Air With Triumphant
Shouting.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Aug. 7.â ln a
majority of cases the Republican ward
caucuses called to select delegates to the
county convention passed off tamely to
night. The issue was one of leadership,
as between Frank Rhodes on the one side
and Darouz and Rider on the other.
There was little if any contest in the up
town wards, and in the First and Second
wards no caucuses were held.
It is conceded that Frank Rhodes will
reign supreme in the First, and will not
have excitement enough to even stir his
blood. But over in the Second Ward, it is
believed that there will be warm, very
warm, work. It seems that Daroux is
badly handicapped.
As far as can be learned, he has none of
his adherents on the election boards, nor
are there seemingly any of the old-time
ward workers with him.
Yet Daroux is very much in evidence,
and although saying nothing, is sawing
wood. His opponents are watching his
every move in fear that in some possible
manner he may be enabled to snatch vic
tory from apparent defeat.
Parties of adherents of both factions
paraded the streets after the caucuses,
shouting the slogans of their respective
sections. All concede that the battle in
the Second to-morrow will be extremely
sultry.

OROVILLE, Cal., Aug. 7.â A meeting
was held by the Republicans of Oroville
at the Courthouse this evening to form a

culated by a committee before the next

The Washington Representative Wants
the Xicaragua Canal Constructed.
TACOMA, Wash., Aug. 7.âCongress
man W. H. Doolittle, elected in 1894 on a
Republican free silver platform, makes a
statement for the press to-day, indorsing
McKinley. He says the St. Louis Repub
lican platform is the only one that makes
the building of the Nicaragua canal pos
sible, and the only one that can result in
bringing about bi-metallism by interna
tional agreement, in which he firmly be
lieves. To build the canal will require an
issuance of Government bonds, and the
Chicago platform declares against bond
issues in time of peace.
For eat vxlle's McKinley Club.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Aug. 7.â A Mc-
Kinley and Hobart club was formed in
Forestville to-night at a mass-meeting
held in Odd,. Fellows' Hall for that pur
pose. The speakers were D. E. McKinlay
and O. O. Webber. From the interest
and enthusiasm manifested to-night, it is
evident that the Republican majority
rolled up in Forestville in past years will
be largely increased next November.
Redwood City Republicans.
REDWOOD CITY, Cal., Aug. 7.â The
Republicans of Redwood City and vicinity
met last night to form a McKinley club.
W. E. Witten presided and Dennis E.

YACOMA'S OFFICIAL SHAKE-UP.
Charter Amendments Declared Illegal
by Judge J'ritchard.
TACOMA* Wash., Aug. 7â Following
fast upon the Superior Court decision de
claring Ed S. Orr legally entitled to the
Mayoralty seat held by A. V. Fawcett
Judge Pritchard to-day handed down a
decision that overturns what little portion
of the municipal government ramained
undisturbed. He has declared charier
amendments invalid. These amendments
provided for a civil service commission
that has been examining applicants and
filling therefrom all municipal positions
and for a Commissioner of Public Works
to sacceed the Board of Public Works.
Thomas Dougherty, Populist, a barber,
wfco under the Fawcett administration
has held the latter position, will now go
back to shaving. There are many other
startling changes as a result of the de
cision. The ground for the decision is
ihat the notice that charter amendments
were to be voted for was not posted in the
various precincts the required length of
time.
BUDD VISITS PLACERVILLE.

PLACERVILLE, Cax., Aug. 7.â On the
Ohio House register here to-day, in bold
ohirography, appears the autograph,
ll James H. Budd, Stockton." The
Governor came unheralded, accompanied
by a colored valet.
The last Legislature passed a bill au
thorizing the transfer on the part of Â£1

Sacramento and Carson stage road. The
transfer comprises the line from Smith's

the Nevada State line, sixty-two miles
away. The bill appropriated $1000, which
became available three weeks ago. Tuck
Holdridge of this place was appointed

ESCAPES NEAR FOWLER,
Convict George Hector Jumps
From a Swiftly Moving
Train.
He Takes Advantage of an Officer's
v Carelessness in Leaving Him
Unguarded.
FRESNO, Cal., Aug. 7.â George Hector,
a convict from Los Angeles, who was be
rne taken by Deputy Sheriff Barney to
San Quentin, escaped from a train this
morning between Selma and Fowler in
this county. The officer did not have his
prisoner handcuffed, and Hector got away
with comparative ease.
The Deputy Sheriff had left the prisoner
in a seat at one end of the car while he
went to the other end to get a drink.
Hector took advantage of the situation
and quietly slipped out on the platform
without attracting anyone's attention and
swung off the steps. The train was going
at full speed when the prisoner made his
plunge for liberty.
Barney did not notice Hector's disap
pearance until he went back to the seat in
which be had left him. It was the over
land train and the seats were filled with
passengers. Some of the passengers, who
had not known that Hector was a prisoner,
told the Deputy Sheriff that they bad seen
Hector go out on the platform.
Another account of the escape states that
it did not occur in Fresno County at ali,
but in Tulare or probably Kern. Accord
ing to a brakeman on the train, the Deputy
Sheriff had fallen asleep and the prisoner
then slipped away from him. The train
hands say that Barney did not awaken for
an hour and a half afterwards, wh en the
train was in FreÂ«no County.
Deputy Sheriff Barney got off the train
at Fowler and enlisted the assistance of
the Constables of that place. They tra
versed the conntry between Selma and
Fowler, but could find no trace of the fugi
tive. Sheriff Scott was immediately noti
fied of the escape and put his deputies at
work immediately. Up to to-night no
trace of Hector had been found.
Hector was under a sentence of twelve
years for burglary and is an ex-convict.
He is considered a desperate character.

unexpected delay on account of the oppo
sition of property-owners along Diana and
Q streets.
A Horsethief'a Good Luck.
â  FRESNO, Cal., Aug. 7.â Deputy Con
stable Crutcher arrested Thomas McDon
ald in this city on a charge of vagrancy on
Wednesday. The officer was satisfied that
McDonald was a horsethief from Ventura
County, and sent a telegram to the Sheriff
of that county. Having received no reply
by this morning, the Deputy Constable
released the suspect. A few hours after
ward Crutcher received a telegram from
Sheriff Cnarlebois asking him to hold
McDonald, and that Charlebois would
come after him on the next train. McDon
ald had made good his escajpe, ana the
officers cannot find him.

VENTURA, Cal., Aug. 7.â A suit in
volving title to 300 parcels of land in the
town of Ventura was decided to-day in

the Superior Conrt. The suit was brought
to enjoin A. J. Bell, County Tax Collector,
from executing deeds to the State for land
sold for delinquent taxes in 1877 and 1878.
It is not believed that an appeal will bo
taken. This decision will lift a cloud from
the title to land held by innocent pur
chasers of property assessed to R. Leroy
and Webb in the years named.
Suing for the Town of Flavel.
ASTORIA, Or., Aug. 7.â Foreclosure
proceedings were filed to-day against the

SAN JOSE LAWYERS FIGHT
W. P. Veuve and 0. 0. Felkner
Discolor Each Other's
Optics,
Come to Blows After a Quarrel Over
a Recent Suit in
Court.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Aug. 7.â Attorneys W.
P. Veuve and O. O. Felkner came to blows
this morning in the main corridor of the
Hall of Records building, and although
the men were soon separated, things were
pretty well mixed while the affair lasted.
Several blows were struck, accompanied
by an unusual amount of loud talk, but
honors were easy at the call of time. Each
of the combatants received a blow over the
eye, which left a slight discoloration.
The bad feeling grew out of the prosecu
tion of A. L. Veuve, a brother of the attor
ney, by Felkner on a claim of $60 owed to
E. J. Baker. Veuve considered that
Felkner had harrased his brother by his
persistence in trying to collect the bill.
This morning the men met in the corridor
and FelKner bowed to Veuva. This aroused
Veuve 'a ire and he stopped and exclaimed:
"I don't want you to ever speak to me
again!"
One word led to another, and Veuve in
sinuated that Felkner, who is an ex
preacher, did not adhere to the truth as it
was laid down in the Scriptures.
Felkner then struck Veuve over the eye,
and the latter retaliated with a like blow.
They were warming up to their work
when bystanders interfered.
LOSE THEIR FINE HOME,
Foreclosure on a Young Hens' Christian
Assot iation Building.
BAN JOSE, Cal., Aug. 7.â The mort
gage upon the fine large building of the
Young Men's Christian Association in this
city was foreclosed in Judge Lorigan's de
partment of the Superior Court to-day.
The plaintiff, O. M. Tupper, was granted
a decree of foreclosure and sale for
$15,767. The building was erected four
years ago by liberal contributions of the
public, but it has been fouud impossible
lately to raise funds to pay off a heavy
debt, which arose from the fact that the
original subscription was not sufficient to
cover the heavy expense of construction.
CROWLEYS TO REWED,
Sensational Chapter to the Di
vorce Suit of Two Months
Ago.
The Doctor and His Ex-Wife Dis
cover That They Each Made^ Mis
takes and Will Try It Again.
Oakland Office Bait Fbascisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Aug. 7. J
It was reported to-night by intimate
friends of Dr. and Mrs. Crowley, whose
sensational divorce a few weeks ago was
the talk of society, that the doctor and
his ex-wife will soon approach the altar
and be again united.
Some days ago a letter was received in
this city from Highland Springs, stating
that the doctor and his wife bad been seen
together, and that a reconciliation was
among the possibilities.
Recent events have supported the theory,
and to-night it was positively stated that
the olive branch had been held out and
accepted by both parties. For several
days past the doctor has made regular
calls at the home that was once his and
has regularly sent pretty bouquets. All
these little secrets were confided by Mrs.
Crowley to her confidante, whom she had
had known since girlhood.
The secret was too good to keep, and to
night it was given to the public.
Less than two months ago the domestic
troubles of the Crowleys were in the
courts. Mrs. Alma Crowley applied for a
divorce and recited the exciting events of
a night on which she had made a discov
ery by entering the doctor's office unan
nounced.
She then went to her home, took the
children and went to stay at the Hotel
Metro pole.
Society was shocked and surprised, for
the doctor and his cultured wife appeared
to be a very devoted couple. The case
went to a speedy trial, and to the surprise
of everybody the serious charges were
withdrawn and the decree was awarded on
the simple ground of cruelty.
The doctor ha<! been previously divorced
and so had his wife, who was formerly the
wife of Hugo Mansfeldt, the musician. It
was after a personal encounter with the
doctor that Mansfeldt obtained a divorce,
and when his wife was free she married
Dr. Crowley.
Major Blaokhnrst Will Speak.
To-morrow afternoon at 3 o'clock Major
Blackhurst of the Volunteers of America will
address a mass-meeting of young men at the
new building of the Young Men's Christian
Association, Mason and Ellis streets.
THE FATHER OF
MODERN LIBERTY
Pope Gregory the Seventh
Given That Proud
Title
BY THE REV. A. M. CLARK
Lecture for the Benefit of the
League of the Cross
Cadets.
MANY HISTORICAL EVENTS.
A Large Audience Was Gathered in
Metropolitan Temple to Hear
the Address.
Rev. Arthur M. Clark, C. S. P., deliv
ered a lecture in Metropolitan Temple last
evening upon "The Father of Modern
Liberty." The lecture was for the benefit
of the uniform and library fund of Com*
pany D, First Regiment, League of the
Cross Cadets of Sacred Heart parish. An
American flag was draped over the read
ing desk, other American flags were upon
the frout of the organ, which also was
adorned with bannerets bearing the sym
bols of the League of the Crc%s, and bunt
ing was looped over the front of the gal
leries. Company D was present in uni
form. The officers of the organization
are: Captain, James T. McÃride; first
lieutenant, Ignatius D. Dwyer; second
lieutenant, Harry McGuerren.
In addition to the lecture quite a pro
gramme had been provided. A large num
ber of Catholic clergymen were present
and occupied seats on the platform, where
also the members of Company D were
seated.
The exercises were opened with an organ
number by Miss Marie Giorgiani. Some
preliminary remarks were made by
Colonel William C. Mahoney, who intro
duced Colonel James T. Smith as the
president of the evening.
Colonel Smith spoke briefly. He said:
This is the era of organization. There are
organizations within organizations, having
for their purpose objects from the building of
a railroad to the election of a President. I
am glad to say that there Is only one organiza
tion in this country which is opposed to
churches. Such organizations as the one to
which I allude cannot be relied upon to
establish more firmly the Republic. Organiza
tions for only material advancement may pro
mote wealth, but they do not necessarily make
better men. Society cannot be pure and good
unless the families that compose it are so.
Society cannot be good unless its individuals
are good. The Leagne of the Cross is organized
to perform a good work, to make good citizens,
to make them worthy to march under that
flag which they always carry and which they
always will carry while this Republic lasts.
Colonel Smith closed his address by an
nouncing that next Sunday afternoon at
2 o'clock a rally of the Junior League of
the Cross will be held in the Mechanics'
Pavilion. At that time competition for
the Archbishop's medal, it was announced,
will take place and an address will be
made by the Archbishop.
M. Grennan followed with cornet solos.
Miss IsaDelle Rogers sang a contralto solo.
C. F. Graeber and David Torres performed
a banjo duet. Tne audience then rose
and sang "My Country, 'Tis of Thee,"
Miss Giorgiani accompanying.
Rev. Arthur M. Clark then began his
lecture. The speaker was very warmly
received. He said that the father of
modern liberty has been the subject of
much speculation. He has been variously
named, from George Washington down.
He bad found only one person who had
guessed whom he had in mind. He would
leave the audience in suspense a little
longer. He spoke in brief as follows:
I once saw two Englishmen, just arrived,
who were strewing the streets vrith h'g that
they had dropped, and they were speaking oi
liberty. This was a country, they thought,
in which they were free to get drunk. Liberty 1
What is it? Liberty to write and say what you
please; to shoot people if you have the money
to buy Judge and jury; to steal. Is that
liberty? No, that is license.
I am not opposed to the freedom of the press,
but I wish that the press would sometimes
muzzle itself on some subjects. License and
liberty are very little alike. Only the man
who thinks and acts and speaks according to
the rules laid down by human reason is tree.
Liberty means slavery and freedom means ser
vice in a sense.
The man who is under the sway of his pas
sions has no freedom. The murderer, if just
ice was done, would lose bis life. He has lost
his freedom. He is a bondsman to the civil
authorities. Not only is there a bound to free
dom ot action, there is a bound to freedom of
thought. Nothing' is more under laws than
thought. A man may possibly imagine a mon
ster of nondescript shape; thought rests on
facts.
A man may teach his children that there is
no God and call that free thought, and they
grow up without any sense of responsibility.
If such teachers were put down there would
be an outcry all over the world that free
thought had been interfered with, but that Is
not free thought.
There have been many false religions. In
the first ages Christianity was assailed by a
power that gave toleration to every other form
of religion. That lasted 300 years, but the
Christian religion was not crushed. When
Constantino became a Catholic he did not put
down pagan worship. The temples were closed
after a time, but were not torn down. Some
of them were standing as late as the eleventh
century.
Alter the invasion of the tribes of Asia, so
ciety began to settle down. There were em
perors who assumed the right to name bish
ops and finally reached the conclusion that
bishops, should aot be invested except by
them. They made bad work of playing at
church. They made me think of Darius Green
and his flying machine he tried to fly on a
Fourth of July. He fell. Just the same way
with emperors and civil rulers when they at
tempt to regulate the church. They have al
ways failed and always will.
Henry IV, an Emperor guilty of every crime,
who stopped at nothing, who had the power,
the soldiers and many unscrupulous people
took everything he could lay his hands
upon Into his own coffer?. Time after time
the people rose against him. Time after time
the father of modern liberty Bent delegates to
pacify the people.
Henry trie Fourth was finally excommuni
cated and he was summoned to Rome to give
an account of himself. The Pontiff Alexander
the Second died while he was on the way and
he did not go.
After the funeral of the Pontiff was
over the Cardinals were assembled. A
cry arose, "Let Hlldebrand be Pope"*
The Cardinals approved. So he was
elected the Pope, Gregory the Bevent n ,
and ne merits the title wnloh be has since
borne, of the father of modern liberty. He
was fearless, He dared to stand up and tell
kings and emperors their duty.
Wnen Henry the Fourth heard of this he was
angry. He was summoned to Borne, but re
fused to go. He -was again excommunicated.
He was summoned to go to some other place
other than Rome to meet Gregory, but he re
fused io go and summoned Gregory to come
down from the throne.
One Christmas eve Gregory began the cele
bration of the mass in the Church of St. Mary's
in Rome. In the middle of the mass an armed
force rode up and took Gregory away and were
going to take him to Germany. The alarm
bells were rang. The gates were closed. The
people sought for and found Gregory a pris
oner in a tower. The people stormed the
tower. Within the tower infamous man and
still more infamous woman threatened Greg
ory and struck him. commanding that he
should take off the excommunication from
Henry the Fourth. He refused, saying that he
stood for the freedom of the church, and he
(foulcl not remove the ban.
The people called for Gregory and were build
ing a mound of staves to reach the tower.
Then the miserable man fell on his knees, as
auch men have always done, and said "Holy ;
father, forgive me!"
The people carried Gregory back to the !
church, where he finished the mass. There was j
after this open war.
The speaker then passed rapidly over
the history of that period and said that at j
Canossa Henry IV whined like a whipped ;
pappy for pardon. Then he continued : * '
From the day of Gregory it was not possible j
for kings and emperors to rule the church anfi
the people with a rod of Iron. It was not only
for the church that Gregory fought Henry.
It was for thie people. If now we have the
right to stand up and speak what we will.it
is because of what was done by Gregory. For
several hundred years the church had a
period of glorious prosperity. Then came in
imitators of Henry. They were rulers who try
to rule human consciences. They were like j
Darius Green. They thought that they could ;
fly. There are State churches. One of the
great echoes of Gregory is the Declaration of
Independence.
The are some -still who would like to rule
over religion and over the church and over
your consciences, and to get you under their
thumbs. I know that you don't mean to let
them get you there. But If they do look out,
for they say that they will not let you have
any of the offices. Perhaps there will be a dlf
lerent condition of affairs next November.
There Is a small, a very small, number of men
who are In favor of investigating churches and j
convents. If they would investigate all around ;
that would not be bo bad, for they might in- j
vestigate themselves.
There are still those who think that the
state should interfere with the church. Let
every man who owns the name of Catholic be
at the polls next November and vote according
to his consclencce. There is no better way to
show your liberty than by the ballot. If there
were such questions running through the
country 200 years ago they would have caused j
war. But now we discuss these questions at
the breakfaÃt-table, at the dinner-table, at the
card- table, at all kinds of tables, and then we |
go to the polls and cast those little white bal
lotsâsnowfiakes they are sometimes called â
nnd a revolution is effected. Let us go out !
from here to-night determined to show that
we understand and appreciate the work of
Gregory, the father of modern liberty.

Offer Accepted by Both
Principals.
CHARGES OF BRIBERY REFUTED.
Van Buskirk Telegraphs That He
Has Signed Articles to Fight
Jeffries.
Joe McAuliffe and Joe Choynski are
matched fora fight. Everything has been
agreed to by the pugilists themselves and
their respective managers, and the signing
of the articles will take place to-dsy at 5
p. m. in the club apartments over "Yaung"
Mitchell's saloon.
The fight will be one of eight rounds,
and the principals are to receive CO per
cent of the gross gate receipts. It will be

pulled off the 28th instant in the large
hall at Woodward's Gardens, lately leased
by the new Occidental Club.
About 4:30 o'clock yesterday, the hour
appointed for the meeting of the princi
pals and their backers, big Joe McAuliffe.
"the Mission Giant," and his manager, old
Barney Farley, the veteran sportsman,
strolled into Mitchell's saloon.
As big Joe lounged carelessly around a
marked difference in his physical aspect
was observed. Joe's normal weight is
about 280 pounds, and while in normal
condition be is the proud and happy pos
sessor of a stomach that would make the
most corpulent and self-satisfied of Alder
men turn green with envy.
Now, however, the result of his training
is manifest. He tips the balance at just
230 pounds, and tiie stomach has gradually
disappeared. As Joe's fighting weight is
215 pounds, it may be worthy of notice
that he will not have to train very severely
in order to attain it by the 28th of this
month.
Oid Barney's face wore the beatific look
of a teething child presented with its first
rubber rattle. The pride of the Mission is
Barney's idol. He flutters all around him
like a hen watching her brood of chicks.
As the hour wore on and no sign of
Choynski appeared, Barney began to grow
nervous. Evidently he feared that his
hopes of showing the world of pugilism
that his charge is the chief gamecock of
all were in a fair way to be blasted.
"Joe and I have come here to fight," he
explained to the assembled sportsmen,
"and Choynski has given bis promise to
meet us here at half-past 4. I wonder why
be doesn't come."
Shortly after 5 o'clock Choynski arrived
with Jimmy CarrolL His excuse for being
late was that he was unavoidably detained
at the Olympic Club. The party then ad
journed to the rooms immediately above
the saloon to discuss the proposition for a
fight. It was composed of Jos McAuliffe
and his manager, Barney Farley; Joe
Choynski and his companion, Jimmy Car
roll; Young Mitchell, Billy Daly and a
Call reporter.
Choynski and McAuliffe were assigned
seats at a small table, directly opposite
each other. The former was the first to
start the conversational ball rolling.
"Well, McAuliffe," he said, rising and
extending his hand, "we are here to make
a fight if possible, and as we are friends
now, we needn't let it interfere with our
amicable relations."
As McAuliffe arose and took the proffered
hand he answered: "That's right, Joe;
we are here to come to an agreement and
not to quarrel."
Turning to Mitchell, Choynski queried,
"How much will the club offer us,
Johnny?"
"Sixty per cent of the gross gate re
ceipts," was the answer. "We want to
bring you two men together, and conse
quently are going to place no impedi
ments* in the way by haggling over any
thing."
Both principals at once agreed that this
was perfectly fair and expressed them
selves as satisfied.
"Now, then," continued Choynski, who
sterued to take the initiative in every
thing, "how many rounds do you expect
us to tight?"
Mitchell replied that the more rounds
fought the more spectators would purchase
tickets and the betier it would be for the
club and the two men. He thought at
least four should be fought, but said six
would suit him better, and if the princi
pals could agree on a larger number of
rounds ttiat would be the best of all.
Here old Barney lifted his arm from
where it had been lovingly resting on the
Mission giant's shoulder, and emphasiz
ing his interrogation with a shake of the
hand and head asked : "Why can't you
agree to fight eight? That will give you
both a show to prove the mettle in you."
The veteran sportsman seemed imbued
with the belief that if Choynski should
show the white feather and run away from
his protege dnring the fight his favorite
ought to have at least several rounds in
v.-hich to catch him.
"Eight rounds suits me." replied
Choynski, laughing at Barney's vehe
mence. McAuliffe also signified his
assent.
Just at this juncture Eddy Graney,
Choynski's manager, arrived. On being
acquainted with the proceedings occurring
during his absence be asked a few ques
tions and said if his charge were satisfied
he was.
The next item to attend to was the time
of the contest. It took longer to agree to
this than to anything else, but all finally
reached the conclusion that the evening of
the 28th inst. would be the proper time.
Mitchell had blank forms ready, and he
and Farley wanted the articles to be signed
then and there, but for some reason or
other Graney objected.
"I promise you on my honor as a gen
tleman," he said, "that if you will appoint
an hour for the signing of articles to-mor
row, we will be here, and will sign them
in accordance with the provisions we have
agreed upon to-day.''
All assented to this, and to-day ats p. m.,
no untoward accident happening in the
meantime, the men and their backers will
assemble at "Young" Mitchell's saloon
and sign articles.
Barney went away with McAuliffe un
der his wing, well satisfied at the agree
ments reached.
"1 am a good friend of yours, Joey," he
was heard to remark, as they paÃsed out
the door, "and when old Barney goes back
on you it will snow in the Torrid Zone."
Choynski, who remained a short while,
was perfectly jubilant over the results of
the conference.
Hardly had the footfalls of McAuliffe
and Barney ceased echoing on the stair
way when he jumped into the air, cracked
his heels together, and proceeded to spar
at an imaginary opponent.
"That's the way I will take him," he
shouted, making a vicious upper-cut with
his right, "and then I wi.l come at him
with my left and dance way so so."
"So so" proved disastrous, for Choynski
got tangled up in a chair and proceeded to
fall in a heap, upsetting a cuspidor and
shaking things up in general.
As he rose with a grin, rubbing his knee
where it had come in contact with the
floor, he looked rather rueful and re
marked:
"I will try a new tack, I think. I will
get a pair of springs fixed on the heels of
my shoes, and whenever I wish to reach
McAuliffe's face|will sail up in the air and
let drive."
Efforts were being made here lately to
show that the boxing permit granted the
new Occidental Club by the Board of
Supervisors was obtained by questionable
methods, bribery being charged.
That these charges are unjust the records
amply prove. â¢ At a meeting of the Board
of Supervisors, held July 27, a permit was
granted the new Occidental Club to give
an exhibition in August on paying a
license fee of $100 and contributing a like
1 sum to the Robinson bequest fund. The
permit was granted without a dissenting
vote.
Tne day before yesterday Mitchell sent
a letter to the foreman of the Grand Jury,
stating his willingness to appear before
that body and convince them that tne in
timations of corruption contained in an
article in the Examiner were false and
malicious.
A letter was also sent the editor of that
paper, making caustic criticisms upon the
paper's conduct for publishing the article
without giving him a chance to refute the
! statements contained therein.
VAN BUSKIRK WILL FIGHT.
He Has Consented to Meet Jeffries
in September in This City.
The sporting fraternity had about con
cluded that Van Buskirk bad departed for
Tarts unknown purposely to avoid a meet
iig with Jeffries when a dispatch arrived
vhich should put all doubts aside as re
gards Van's future intentions.
Van Bus Kirk is now in Stockton, but
j st as soon as he read in the local papers
ttat the sporting people of this City were
v cier the impression that he had shown
tie white feather he consulted with his
fiends, after which he quickly changed
h â  programme, as will be seen by the fol-
Icving dispatch to The Call:
. :TOCKTON, Cal., Aug. 7.â Theodore Van
B kirk has been here for two days since his
fl; . t with Davis. He trained in Stocicton for
h; bout with Corrigan on July 4 and has a
i nt aber of friends here. He was on his way to
Si; on and Soda Springs, where he intended
to -vend a month, but to-night his plans have
be-.; changed somewhat, and he telegraphed
hi consent to sign ai tides to tight Jeffries on
Se;ember 2, in San Francisco.
â¢Via Buskirk may remain here fora time and
trt.a at the baths, as he found them an ideal
pis : c for work when reducing for his fight
wl\ Corrigan. The fight is to take place be
fore the Coima Club. Van Buskirk has been
oft -ed $1500 or 60 per cent of the receipts.
He 7ill probably accept the percentage offer
of tie club.
Jeffries had about given up all hope of a
meaing with Van Buskirk, but when he
wa informed last evening that Van had
agr-ed to meet him under the conditions
offeed them recently by the Colma club
bt ~as more than pleased, and to-day he
wil. go into strict training. There is no
doi ,t that Jeffries will be a strong favor
| ite, till Van Buskirk has many warm ad-
I mi: rs among the boxing element of the
Olympic Club.
. T^e National Club will give its enter
tainment some evening between the 20th
and :he 27th of this month, and its star
engagement is a ten-round contest be
tween George Green and Billy GallagheT.
T; .i evening Jack Welsh and Jack Mc-
Antr, two antiquated pugs, will leave
for ','rockett, in Contra Costa County,
whUfe they are booked to fight to a finish
for an alleged purse of $200.
As the pugs are in the very poorest con
diticr. men can be, having trained exclu
sivehon steam beer, the fraternity will
not be at all surprised to hear of a bad
I endi.-.y to a most miserable match.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, AUGUST 8, 1896.
QUENCHED THEIR
COUNCIL FIRES,
Red Men and Degree of
Pocahontas Break Camp
Reluctantly.
GREAT CHIEFS RAISED.
Installation of Oificers Who Will
Preside for the Ensuing
Year.
TESTIMONIALS OF AFFECTION.
Retiring Leaders Presented With
Trophies of Their Constituents'
Love and Appreciation.
The council fires of the Improved Order
of Red Men and the Degree of Pocahontas
have been quenched. In many respects
the session just ended has been one of the
REV. J. SIMS, GREAT SACHEM ELECT.
most pleasant in the hi-tory of the order
in this State, and the brave warriors and
the followers of John Smith's dusky
savior were loth to cover the fires of
friendship that hare burned brightly all
week. It was announced that at high sun
the council camp would be deserted, but
the lingering rays of light were creeping
up from the West when the Red Men
turned their backs upon the dying em*
bers.
The credential committee of the Red
Men reported that there were 112 repre
sentatives present during the session, rep
resenting 36 tribes. The Past Sachem and
Great Council degrees were conferred on
53 members during the session.
A warm debate was precipitated re
garding the advisability of the council
assuming the publication of the In
signia, the offi cial organ. Heretofore the
j ournal has been published by private par
ties, but a resolution to have the council
publish it was, after much opposition,
carried.
It was decided to offer a trophy valued
at $100 to the team giving the most
meritorious rendition of the adoption de
gree before the next Great Council. A
trophy of similar value will also be
awarded to toe tribe showing the largest
percentage of increase in the membership
during the ensuing year. For the best
rendition of the hunters', warriors' and
chiefs' degree a trophy valued at $50 will
be given.
Resolutions of thanks were extended the
press for the attention given the council, ,
to the retiring great sachem for his labors
for the order during the year past and for
his patience and justness in presiding over
the council. J. J. Bullock ot Metamora
Tribe No. 4, Redwood, introduced a reso
lution thanking the local tribes for their
hospitality. The resolution carried.
The committee on deceased members
presented resolutions of sorrow and con
dolence. Special menton was made of the
death of A. J. Baker, past great incohonee
(the highest officer of the United States
Council).
Although there had been some talk of a
contest for the next meeting place of the
council there was no opposition in the
council, Stockton being chosen unan
imously.
The finance committee reported that it
bad estimated the receipts for the coming
year at $5004 32 and the disbursements at
$3460. leaving a prospective balance of
$1584 32. It was decided to offer prizes of
$30, $15 and $5 to the persons securing the
greatest number of subscribers for the
official organ, no prize to be paid for less
than thirty subscriptions.
The main business of the afternoon was
the advancing or installation of the chiefs

prophet; Josiah Sims. No. 49, Nevada City,

\ gater. Benjamin F. Josselyn, great rep
resentative, on behalf of the membeis of
tbe council, presented Past Great Sachem
A. Jackson with a valuable testimonial,
when the retiring head of the order made
a touchine response. A vote of thanks
was extended Henry A. Chase for assist
ance rendered the .chief of records.
The Degree of Pocahontas spent most of
yesterday forenoon in discussing commit
tee reports. In the afternoon Great
Sachem-elect Josiah Sims, assisted by Mrs.
Goodetadt, past great chief, and Lydia A.

Rev. Josiah Sims, great sachem, on be
half of the ladies, presented the retiring
great Pocahontas, Mabel Curtis, with a
beautiful pin in the form of a love knot.
Miss Curtis responded feelingly, and the
council fire of the Degree of Pocahontas
was quenched with the tears of friend
ship.
Both councils will meet in Stockton in
one year. _______________
FOUND TUBERCULOUS BEEF.
Elerpn Carcasses Seised by Market In
spector Davis in Bntchertown.
Market Inspector Davis' vigilant watch
on Butchertown for tuberculous beef has
been handsomely rewarded during the
past week, no less than eleven carcasses of
cows that showed every evidence of the
dread disease having been captured and
sent to the fertilizing works.
Davis feels assured that the recent tests
of dairy herds that have resulted in the
detection of so many cases have led to the
sale by dairymen of suspected stock, and
that this accounts for the large amount of
tuberculous beef discovered. The watch
on the slaughter-houses will be kept up as
long as suspected cattle come in.
PERIL OF TWO GIRLS,
They Were Plunged Into the
Bay by the Capsizing of
a Boat.
Attorney Robert H Marrow Comes
to the Rescue in the Very Nick
of Time.
By the coolness and forethought of
Robert A. Morrow, a young attorney lo
cated in the Crocker building, two young
society ladies of this City were rescued
from what in all probability would have
been a watery grave.
The two young ladies in question, Miss
B. Minette and Mis* Isabel Hitchcock, ac
e ompanied by Morrow, who is captain of
the sloop yacht Pride of the Bay, and
Thomas Merrill, boarded the yacht yeÂ«ter
dayfor a pleasure excursion.
Near Tamalpais the yacht was anchored,
with the intention of the party embark
ing in the small boat. Merrill got into
the boat first, followed by Miss Minette.
Morrow and Miss Hitchcock stepped
into the boat at the same time, and their
combined weight on one side of the small
craft was sufficient to capeize it. All the
party were plunged into the water in a
twinkling.
Merrill, who is unable to swim s stroke,
managed to clamber npon the Keel of the
overturned skiff. The two ladies remained
strusreline in the water.
Inciimbered by 2 his wearing apparel as
he was, Morrow swam to where Miss
Minette was endeavoring to keep afloat
and handed her a rope thrown out by Mer
rill, who had regained the yacht. Then he
struqk out for Miss Hitchcock and reached
her as she was about to sink for the third
time.
Nearly exhausted, the youthful attorney
reached the side of the vessel, where he
was relieved of his charge.
Both young ladies were at once taken
upon the ark Linda, stationed near by,
where they were properly cared for by
members of their own sex.
Beyond a slight cold contracted by his
dip in the cold waters of the bay, Morrow
is none the worse for his heroic adventure.

CLERK CURRY
WINS HIS CASE,
Decision in His Favor
by the Supreme
Court.
THE FEE BILL OF 1895.
It Is Constitutional, So Says
the Highest
Court
A RAP AT THE SHERIFF.
He Did Not Enforce the Actâ A Public*
Spirited Official Fu'iy
Sustained.
The Supreme Court yesterday declared
that County Clerk Charles F. Curry acted
within the lines of his duty when he en
forced the fee bill of 1895. He had been
advised to that course by Delmas & Short
ndge, and was perhaps the only officer in
this City who had enforced the act. He
was abused and criticised for so doing, but
the advice of his attorneys was sustained
by Judge Seawell, and now the Supreme
Court nays Judge Seawell was right. Mas
tick & Mastick were attorneys for Miller
etal., whose claim is here shown to be
wholly without foundation.
It is understood that the Sheriff has ig
nored the act of 1895, under advice, of
course. If so, the Sheriff may be liable to
the City for thousands of dollars, which
be should have collected.
The decision is a most important one.
It may have a bearing on the question as
to whether the present County officers
hold office for two or fonr years. This
matter is now in the Supreme Court.
The following is the decision :
8. F., No. 394. Dept. 2.
Henry Miller et al., appellants, vs. Charles
F. Curry, respondent.
The action is made to compel defendant to
file an answer in a civil case without the pay
ment of the fees required by the act of March
28, 1895, establishing the fees of county,
township and other officers, and of juries and
witnesses in this State. (Statute of '95, page
268.) The sole question presented on this ap
peal and thereiore the only question to be de
cided, is the applicability of the snid act of
1895 to the City and County of San Francisco.
At the time of the adoption of the present con
stitution the fee Dill applying to the City and
County of San Francisco was found in the act
passed February 9, 1866. (Btatute 1865-66,
page 66.) If the act was repealed by the act
of 1895, then the judgment ol the trial court
is correct. If, on the other hand, the act of
1866 is still In force, appellants' contention
must prevail.
Appellants argued that the act of March 28,
1895, though a general act, does not in terms
repeal the act of 1866, that there is no neces
sary repeal by implication, that it does not in
terms apply to the officers of a city and county,
and that, therefore, the general .statute is to be
read as silently excluding from its operation
the special statute of 1866.
Ey article 11, section 5, of the constitution
the Legislature is enjoined to provide a uni
form system of county government; by vari
ous statutes to regulate the compensation of
county officers in proportion to their duties
and to provide for the strict accountability ot
all such officers for the fees and moneys col
lected by them in their official capacity. By
section 7 of the same article the provisions of
the constitution affecting cities and affecting
counties are, so far as may be, made applicable
to consolidated city and county governments,
while by article 4, section 25, of the constitu
tion the Legislature is prohibited from passing
special or local laws affecting the fees or sala
ries of any ofhcei (Sud. 29) or prescribing
the powers and duties of officers in counties,
cities and cities and counties (Sub. 28) or to
regulate city or township business (Sub. 9).
The law under consideration is general in
its terms, and, while it makes no distinct
mention of officers in consolidated govern
ments, it undertakes to establish the fees not
alone of county and township officers, but of
other officers in this State. In the somewhat
anomalous municipal corporations recognized
by the constitution and known to the law
as consolidated cities and counties, the offi
cers do not lose their distinctive character as
county officers and of city officers merely be-
CAUse they hold within the corporate limitÃ of
such governments. The County ClerS of the
City and County of San Francisco, Sheriff of
the City aÂ»d County of San Francisco, Re
corder of the City and County of San Fran
cisco are each and all county offi
cers. They have no place properly
as officers of the City. Upon the
other hand the Mayor of the City and County
is distinctly and separately a City officer, as
distinguished from a County officer. A law,
therefore, which under the constitutional
mandate undertook to regulate the duties or
the compensation of county officers would fill
all the basic requisites ol the constitution,
that all laws of a general nature shall have a
uniform operation (Con. Art. I, Sec. 2), If it
should be held that its terms did not apply
to and were not meant to apply to county
officers in consolidated governments. And it
must therefore be concluded, without room
for question, that the act under consideration
is in its terms applicable to the City and
County of San Francisco.
But when this point has been reached, ap
pellant contends that he may invoke the rule
and principle expressed in Home for Inebri
ates vs. Ki-is, 95 Cal. 142, ana that under the
authority of this case the City and County of
San Francisco must be excepted from the oper
ation of the law, and all that this court did in
the Reis case was to recognize certain well set
tled principles governing the interpretation of
statutes. H founded the decision in that par
ticular case upon the maxim that repeals by
implication are not favored, and that where
permissible an earlier special statute will be
construed to harmonize with a general later
one. It was, in short, but the application of
the maxim, "Generalla specialious non do
rogant."
But this rule has its limits; it means no
more than that in arriving at the intention of
the Legislature, which is always to govern, and
in endeavoring to reach that intention from
the act itselfâ unless there be plain and ex
plicit terms of repeal in the latter act, or un
less the provisions of the two acts be so incon
sistent that both may not standâ lt will be as
sumed that the Legislature in making general
provision for all cases diet not mean to destroy
the effect of a rule laid down with explicit
care and directness and applicable to a partic
ular class of.casos. But this after all is a method
of arriving at the legislative intention when
other and better means are not available. So
it was held in the Reis case that there was no
such repugnancy in the latter act as made
plain the intention of the Legislature that the
moneys provided for in the earlier act were
no longer to be paid over to the Home of the
Inebriates.
There are other rules of construction, how
ever, of equal digaity and potency. The rules
that we have been considering apply only in
a case where a repugnancy between the acts is
not manifest. If such repugnancy exists, then
it is well settled that the earlier act must fall.
(Endlich Interpretation of Statutes, section
206); only so tar as the two acts are not in
their terms incompatible with each other is
the earlier act allowed to stand. It is a funda
mental rule for the interpretation of statutes
that where the instrument is susceptibleof two
permissible constructions, by one of which it is
valid, by the other of which it is void, the one
in favor of its validity and of natural right
will prevail, for courts will only upon the
clearest showing of invalidity Overthrow the
enactments of a co-ordinate department of
Government. The Legislature is presumed to
know the constitution and the limitations
upon its powers therein set forth.
In the case at bar, as has been said, the
Legislature had only the power to pass a gen
eral law upon the subject in question applica
ble to all county officers. If it were the legis
lative intentâ and the legislative intent is
always the ultimate fact to be determinedâ
to except the county officers of the City and
County of San Francisco from the operation of
the law, this might as well have been done by
an exception expressed in the terms of the act
itself. No one would have a moment's ques
tion but that such an exception would impair
the general operation of the law and thus vio
late the provisions of article 11, section 2, of
the constitution.
In that event either the exception -would be
TOid, or if inseparable from the other parts of
the law the latter act would fall. But that
constitutional provision would be no less vio
lated if the Legislature did not mean and in
tend that the statute of 186t> should be re
pealed hy the act of 1895, tne latter will still
be a law purporting to be general in its terms, I
yet not having a uniform operation by reason (
of the exception indicated. There is thus a I
plain repugnancy between the acts of 1866
and 1895, which cannot be disposed of except I
by the conclusion that the Legislature in- I
tended in the act of 1895 'o pass a valid law, |
and that to do so the repeal oi the act of 1866 i
resulted. The judgment appealed from is i
affirmed. Henshaw, J.

THE "WORLD'S" YARN,
Berry and Kroman Deny the Truth of
the Report That They Will
Crawl to New York.
There are two angry men in Berkeley^
and they are J. C. Berry and Peter Kro
man. tailors and partners in a shop at
Berkeley station. The object of their in
dignation is a big picture in the New York
World of them sprawling Jizard-fashion
across tbe page.
In the publication they are represented
as preparing to go on all-fours across the
continent, from San Francisco to New
York, expecting to complete their crawl in
ten months and get a barrel of dollars
when they finished. Letters from several
Berkeley physicians were published, all
testifying to the feasibility of the under
taking.
When interviewed yesterday evening
Berry and Kroman made no secret of
their feelings.
"It's all nonsense," said J. C. Berry,
"and some joker is having a lot of fun at
our expense. You may say that we never
thought of any such foolishness.
"If we could find the fellow who sent
that yarn to the New York paper we
would use some of our surplus energy on
his head possibly. We are active mem
bers of the Crescent Athletic Club of
Berkeley, and when we exercise our
muscle we do it on our feet, not on our
hands and feet like babies/
Several of the physicians mentioned
stated yesterday that they were asked by
letters from the World office for tneir
opinions, and they knew nothing eistt
about the proposed performance.
FIGHTING FOR PURE FOOD,
Stringent Measures Adopted by
the Local Fruit Ex
change.
An Attorney Engaged to Prosecute
Cases of Importation of Spur i.
ons Preserves.
A meeting of the board of directors of
the San Francisco Fruit Exchange was
held at the rooms of the exchange yester
day. Colonel Bendel, president of the
exchange, presided and nearly every
prominent fruit canner was represented.
The first and most important business of
the meeting was the receiving of a report
of the committee on adulterated goods.
The report was published in The Call
yesterday and was very extensive. It
dealt with the subject in a very thorough
manner, and was adopted, with certain
references of Superintendent Hobbs
stricken out. A general discussion on the
report took place, and the recommenda
tions of the committee were unanimously
adopted.
George H. Cabamss was appointed attor
ney for the Exchange, to act as special
counsel for the prosecution of cases in the
Police courts.
It was decided that an active and vigor
ous campaign be entered into, in an en
deavor to stamp out the adulterated jellies
and jams brought from the East, with the
assistance of Mr. Cabaniss, who will at
tend actively to the work in the Police
Court, provided the necessary proofs can
be obtained. This can only be done, pro
vided the Board of Supervisors recognizes
the importance of the subject, and makes
the necessary appropriation, so that the
work may be done in a complete and thor
ough manner.
The secretary was instructed to com
municate with Mr. Cabanibs and inform
him of his selection as attorney, and ask
for a conference with him, as well as the
Producers' and Manufacturers' Associa
tion, Merchants' Association, and kindred
organizations, at an early date, to consider
the subject. The secretary was also in
structed to communicate with the Board
of Supervisors, and ask for a conference,
so that the matter may be laid before
them in the proper manner and the needs
made manifest.
Subsequently to this, the board took up
the question of fictitious California labels
being placed upon Eastern canned fruits
by Eastern packers. The secretary read a
letter which he bad sent to the packers at
Baltimore, who, it was claimed, were en
deavoring to foist these goods upon the
public It was decided that as soon as a
reply was received a vigorous effort would
be made to expose this business to the
Eastern jobbers and grocers, so that they
might understand what they were pur
chasing. A report was also received for
the adoption of a standard by the Califor
nia packers, which included California
canned fruits and dried fruits, and the
meeting thenadjourned.
Feast of St. Dominic.
At St. Dominic's Church to-morrow will be
celebrated the feast of the patron of the
church and the founder of the Dominican Or
der. The services will be as usual throughout
the morning until 10:30 a. m. when solemn
high mass will be celebrated by the Francis
can Fathers, and a panegyric of the saint
preached by Very Rev. Father Wyman of the
Faulist Fathers.

>t>B VICIS-PRBBIDENT-
GARRET A. HOEART, of New Jersey
CXKCTIGW NOVEMBER 3. 1896.
This is tbe day to leave orders for The
Scitbat Call.
People who wish to promote home in
dustry must vote the home-industry ticket.
" Free silver or bust" is the Democratic
cry, and the people are prepared to bet 16
to 1 on the bust.
From the way the workingmen are com
ing out for McKinley it is clear the free
traders cannot fool them again.
It begins to look as if tbe Democratic
leaders were incapable of managing a
campaign much less a government.
It is one thing to applaud Bryan's fluent
oratory, but quite another to elect him
President and trust the Nation to him.
The blunders of Democracy when out of
office hurt nobody but itself, but Demo
cratic blundering in office hurts the whole
country.
Tbe free coinage of silver is less impor
tant than a freer circulation of gold. Let
us revive industry and set both, metals
moving.
What would it profit your business to
have the value of money suddenly shifted
from its present basis to that of the money
of Mexico? _
Theremonetization of silver is a strictly
business proposition and no intelligent
man of business is going to intrust it to the
hands of incompetent men.
"The platform of the Chicago conven
tion," says Tom Reed, "is not a bimetal
lic platform, and don't let them make you
believe that bimetallism is what they are
after." _
As Democracy proposes to cut the value
of wasres in half by silver monometallism
it is having a hard time just now in trying
to explain to workingmen where their
benefit will come in.
Watson, like Tillman, insists that this is
â¢ sectional campaign and says Sewall
mast come down, because he is an Eastern
man. It is not necessary to ask what
patriots think of that.
A tariff system that gives tbe farmer a
market at his own door for all his products
is certainly better than one which sends
him on a wild-goose chase, hunting for a
market all round the world.
The road that leads to American pros
perity is hedged with protection to Ameri
can labor, and as long as we keep in the
middle oi that road and do noi break
down the hedge we are all right.
No level-headed Democrat is going to
vote against the interests of his own busi
ness for the sate of helping the politicians
of his party to get office. He tried that in
1892, but be won't try it any more.
One of the chief points in the campaign
of education is to show the people that
the money issue is not a contest between
gold and silver, but between Republican
bimetallism and Democratic monometal
lism.
The Democratic National Committee is
kept so busy organizing the metaphors of
Bryan's speeches and getting them into
harmony with one another that it nas not
had time so far to pay any attention to the
campaign.
â  *
The Cleveland campaign of 1892 for free
trade was as promising as the present one
for free silver, and as the people have h&d
now nearly four years' experience with
the old promises they know just how
much reliance to put on the new ones.
Any policy of the coinage of free silver
that would drive gold out of the country
or raise it to a premium would be disas
trous to every trade and every home and
oppress with a heavy burden all who have
mortgages or other obligations that must
be paid in gold.
When Harrison was President he sent
stanch bimetallists to represent this coun
try at the monetary conference in Brus
sels, but when Cleveland became President
he refused to send any at all. Thus Re
publican efforts to achieve international
bimetallism were baffled by the Demo
cratic administration. Had Harrison been
re-elected the issue would have been vir
tually settled by this time.
Mr. Bingerly, editor and proprietor of
the Philadelphia Record, is a candidate for
Presidential elector on the Democratic
ticket in Pennsylvania, but is fighting the
ticket with his paper in good fashion. He
cheerfully explains the situation by saying
that as his ticket has no chanct of election
in Pennsylvania he will never be called on
to vote fÂ«r Bryan, and therefore it is not
worth while for hia to take the trouble to
resign.
INTERNATIONAL BIMETALLISM.
In giving to the country a pledge to pro
mote an international agreement for tbe
free coinage of silver the Republican party
makes no vain promise to the people, nor
does it ask them to expect something
whose accomplishment is either remote or
improbable. European sentiment in favor
of international bimetallism is rapidly in
creasing in strength, and if we do not act
foolishly it will be in the power of our
Government to materially advance the
cause for which all bimetallista are work
ing.
It will be remembered that when Har
rison was President an international
mouetaiy conference was called to meet
at Brussels, and strong and able bimetal
lists were sent to represent us there.
Nothing was accomplished at that confer
ence beyond laying the foundations for
future work and arranging as far as possi
ble the preliminaries of a future agree
ment. Had Harrison remained in office,
or had any Republican succeeded him, the
work begun at Brussels would have been
continued, and no one can question that
at the oroper moment the whole power
and influence of our Government would
have been thrown on the side of bimetal
lism, and by this time, if the free coinage
of silver had not been provided for, there
would have been, at any rate, a much en
larged use of it as money.
The success of the Democratic party In
1892 completely blocked the hopes, of bi
metallism. Cleveland took his stand solidly
for monometallism and sullenly refused
any consideration of remonetizing silver.
For the purpose of compelling him to take
some action in the matter, a resolution
was passed by both houses of Congress,
instructing the President to invite an in
ternational conference to resume the work
which had been begun at Brussels. These
instructions Cleveland utterly ignored.
He paid no attention to the resolution
whatever, and as Congress had no means
of compelling him to obey, the whole plan
of arranging for an international agree
ment on the subject was necessarily
dropped, fer of course Europe would not
act without the United States.
Since the adjournment of the Brussels
conference there are unmistakable evi
dences that Europe is more than willing
to meet America half way in restoring sil
ver to its place as a money metal. Tbe
closing of the Indian mints to silver cofb
age and the repeal of the silver purchasing
act in this country were followed by a fall
in the price of silver, which affected the
trade of European nations much more
powerfully than ours. As a consequence,
even in England itself a strong bimetallic
party has grown up, and numbers among
its leaders some of the ablest members of
the Salisbury Ministry. All of these men
would heartily co-operate with American
bimetallists in any wise ana business-like
plan, but all advise against the folly of
our attempting free coinage alone. The
election of Bryan would disturb trade,
drive gold from this country to Europe,
open a market here for European silver
and ruin the hopes of international bi
metallism. The election of McKinley, on
the other hand, would restore prosperity
in America, draw gold from Europe, force
the people to feel the need of silver money,
and thus lead to an agreement which
would remonetize silver and establish a
uniform bimetallism all round the world.
WHY AT PAR.
When Major McKinley told a delegation
of workingmen that. "our currency to-day
is as good â all of it is as good as gold â and
it is the unfaltering determination of tbe
Republican party to so keep and maintain
it forever," he combined a great truth
with a solemn pledge. When bimetallism
comes the money of the country will be as
it is now, absolutely without variableness
In standard of value. Commerce knows
nothing about parties or party politics,
but it does know when the circulating
money of a people is unstable and fluctu
ating, and with such money commerce
will have nothing to do. Had Major Mc-
Kinley talked to those workingmen a
week he could not have given them, the
country and tbe commercial world more
positive assurance that our currency is to
be maintained at par forever.
But how is it, some may ask:, that silver
is kept at par with gold when its bullion
value is little more than half the value of
gold? A standard silver dollar is a legal
tender for customs and excise duties, but
it is not the legal-tender quality of the
silver dollar that holds it on a parity with
gold, nor yet because it is interchangeable
with gold, for it is not interchangeable.
In fact, do two kinds of our money are
interchangeable under compulsion, but in
an indirect way silver dollars may be con
verted into gold dollars, and because the
way is indirect their parity can be main
tained. A direct interchange over the
treasury's counter would destroy tbe par
ity at once, because the Government would
then be a money-exchange broker, while
the exchange would be made for specula
tive purposes, which would involve the
integrity of silver, because, as a matter of
convenience, if for no other reason, holders
of silver would prefer to hare gold.
As we have said, silver dollars are re
ceivable for excise and customs duties be
cause they are a legal tender the same as
gold. Tha Government knows no differ
ence between the legal tender qualities of
the metals. The option is not with the
Government in the matter of receiving
and paying legal tender money. Hence,
Richard Roe paj's his excise and customs
duties, all or in part, in silver dollars be
cause silver dollars are bulky and less
convenient to handle than gold. Then he
presents tbe coupons of his bonds or other
evidence of the Nation's indebtedness to
him and again he exercises his option
right and asks that he be paid in gold.
Thus he indirectly converts his silver into
gold and thus does the Government main
tain the parity of the metals. The Gov
ernment is supposed to receive enough
gold for customs and excise duties from
those with whom gold paymeut is more
convenient. That is to say, as a rule im
porters find it more convenient to pay
their customs duties in gold, while those
who pay internal revenue raxes find it
more convenient to pay in silver. It must
be remembered that while silver dollars
are a legal tender for duties, silver certifi
cates are not. The Government will not
receive them for either customs or excise
duties. That i? the way the Government
maintains the parity of gold and silver.
Tbe Republican party proposes, however,
to invite the commercial nations to join
with the United States and confer upon,
silver equal importance with gold so that
they will themselves maintain their par
ity without legislation, or by the exercise
of the right of option by either payor or
payee.
ISON AND TREE TRADE.
It is shown in a local article in to-day's
Call that the peculiar free-trade notions
of Bryan, applied to the iron industry,
would result in ruin to the manufacturers
and in pauperism for the masses.
England is a fine example of the evil
wrought by free trade-in an iron-manu-
facturing region, and it is shown by the
evidence of experts and practical business
[ men that, under free trade, American
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, AUGUST 8, 1896.
workmen would have to come down to the
English level of wages or the American
factories would have to be closed. It is
even shown that free trade would work
ruin by reason of Canadian competition.
Several prominent American manufactur
ers say they can make agricultural imple
ments in Canada for American consump
tion cheaper than in the United States,
owing to the disparity of wages between
the two countries.
It will be borne in mind that the rem
edy of William Jennings Bryan for these
evils and for other industrial ills is free
trade. It is seen, however, that the great
industries of the country fail one by one
when touched by the blight of free trade.
REPUBLICAN "PARALYSIS."
In the financial plank of the Bryan-
Aitgeld platform it is charged that gold
"monometallism has locked fast the pros
perity of an industrial people in tbe
paralysis of nard times." It need not be
said that the platform-makers had the Re
publican pany in mind when the above
charge was made, for the conduct of the
affairs of the country from 1873 down was
being considered.
There is no doubt at all that the Repub
lican party is responsible for the conduct
of the Government between 1861 and 1893,
consequently it was tinder Republican
rule that "paralysis" swooped down and
"locked fast industrial prosperity" in its
devouring embrace. It would be hard to
say whether the "paralysis" charge was
made in blind, stupid ignorance, or was
prompted by hearts desperately wicked
and deceitful to the last degree, but any
way it was foolish to go on record as in
dorsing such a glaring falsehood.
Let us see how dreadfully industrial
prosperity was paralyzed by Republican
rule during tne two decades following 1870.
During that period of twenty years the
value of manufactured products alone
increased to over $9,000,000,000 from $3,
--400,000,000. In 1870 the average wages per
annum paid to tbe several classes of labor
engaged in manufacturing establishments
was |310 per operative and the total amount
paid was something over $600,000,000. In
1890 the average annual wages was $489
per operative and the total disbursement
was over $2,000,000,000, while the capital
invested in manufacturing plants increased
from $1,700,000,000 in 1870 to $6,200,000,000
in 1890. It would seem that labor ought
to be able to stand a good deal of that
kind of "paralysis."
But the official report of the condition
of labor under Republican rule show other
strokes of "paralysis" that were inflicted
upon labor. Since 1870 the population of
the United States has increased not far
from 64 per cent, but meanwhile deposits
in savings banks have increased about 250
per cent, and tbe number of people mak
ing deposits has increased quite 200 per
cent. In 1870 the savings banks had a
total of nearly $550,000,000 on deposit
with 1 to every 24 of the popula
tion for depositors. In 1890 "paralyzed
labor" had over $1,600,000,000 lodg(d in
savings bangs, and the percentage was 1
to every 15 of population.
When Mr. McKinley is elected the same
old "paralysis" will resume business.
THE SUNDAY CALL
To-morrow's issue oi The Call will be
another splendid example of a thoroughly
Californian Sunday newspaper. It will
contain a large number of beautiful illus
trations drawn especially lor Thk Call
and by The Call artists right here in San
Francisco. And these illustrations will
be accompanied by descriptive writings of
particular interest, because they are tbe
work of California men and women and
are mainly concerning a large variety of
topics of intense human interest in this
City and State.
The Sunday Call is not a pictorial
paper, but most of its features are hand
somely illustrated. The pictures, how
ever, are subsidiary to the reading matter,
and not vice versa. Ideals in journalism
vary as in all departments of human ac
tivity, but Tee Call's ideal of what a
Sunday newspaper ought to be â while per
haps never quite attained, as ideals never
areâ seems to coincide with the public's
ideas on the same subject. We speak now
with the subscription books in mental
view. After all, it is the subscription list
that tells which newspaper is the best
newspaper, for while individual taste
varies greatly the consensus of public
opinion in a cultured community like
California does not err in matters of this
kind. By all of iiich is meant to say
that The Sckday Call is the most popular
Sunday paper in California, as its con
star tly increasing subscription list clearly
demonstrates. The Sunday Call, too, is
copied by the Eastern newspaper more
than is any other Sunday newspaper ou
the Pacific Coast.
Some of the features of to-morrow's
issue are contained in the following list:
A San Francisco Renaissance.
Weird Melodies of a Strange People,
now all the fad in musical circle?.
The Social Status of Jack Tar and His
Temptations Ashore.
What a Scboolmarm Saw Behind the

A San Francisco Girl Three Days in the
London Season.
An Old Man's Pitiful Tale of Starvation.
The Laziest Mule in tbe World.
Crests and Emblems of the San Fran
cisco Clubs.
The Mountain Lakes of California.
And a host of new things, strange
things, things of human interest, pictur
esque things, good literature.
STEWART ON WEBSTER.
New Yor* Press.
Father Abraham Stewart, the Sheik Ilderhn
of the silver forces, is at the Hoffman House
with his white-yellow whiskers. The Senator
from Nevada is only 69 years old, bnt looks
100. His arguments on the "Intrinsic" value
of silver remind me of one of Coolidge's
stories. In a speech In the Senate he used the
word in a peculiar sense, whereupon Senator
Dolph ventured the suggestion that WeDSter
did not sanction such usage.
"Webster? What Websier?" demanded Mr.
Stewart, savagely.
"Webster's dictionary," said Dolph, soitly.
"Webster's dictionary I" exclaimed Stewart,
with a sneer. "I never want to have that
book quoted to me again. Why, every school
boy in the United States knows that it is noth
ing but a jumble of words 1"

SLIGHTLY DISFIGURED.
Visalia Delta.
The fight has been fought and won. Four
teen hundred sturdy Populists traveled in the
"middle of tbe road" to St. Louis, carrying
with them the planks they have been twelve
years in hewing and planing and framing,
with which they expected to build a platform
for their chosen leaders to stand upon. They
met Democracy in disguise, saw it and
were conquered. They were considerately
permitted to erect their platform, and
then ready-made candidates were placed upon
it for them. In the contention that followed,
when the sell-out was realized, the Populists
were beaten, disfigured and knocked out of the
ring, and ate now coming home and plodding
their way 'cross lots.

VIEWS OF WESTERN EDITORS.
The Political Sideshow.
Fresno Republican.
"The next thing in our political sideshow,"
the showman remarked, "is the free silver
chameleon, which possesses the remarkable
property of assuming the color of almost any
thing that approaches it. At present, ladies
and gentlemen, it is of a dark alfalfa hue, In
dicating that a Populist is in the immediate
vicinity. Now it changes to that rich amber
color characteristic of the Kentucky beverage,
and it is evident that a Democrat has ap
proached it. That vapid, lifeless, ambiguous
color which it now assumes indicates that a
representative of the so-called silver party is
not far away. I will speak the words 'lree
silver,' ladies and gentlemen. Observe, as I
do so, how it throws its left lore paw against
its heart and opens its moutli in an effort to
say something. It is a very interesting
creature.
"Tne next thing to be exhibited is the cele
brated educated Populist flea, Direct Legisla
tion, so named because when you put your
finger oh him he is not there. Observe how
mysteriously he disappears. It is presumed
by some that the frea-silver chameleon swal
lows him, but for this we do not vouch, merely
calling attention to the fact that he disap
pears whenever he is wanted. It may be that
he is merely an optical illusion and that there
really is no such thing, but our patrons are
left to decide this interesting question lor
themselves. , '
Tnis, fellow citizens, is the celebrated
Democratic goat, Dividedwelall, which buits
with both ends. Ooserve that when I say
'Grover' to this end it rushes at mo furiously,
and when I say 'Altgeid' to the other end it
butts at me no less madly. The explanation
of the phenomenon is simple: During the last
four years the creature has played in political
cream, and as a consequence it got to be all
butter. . * .
"Next in order is the celebrated panoramic
portraiture of the Popudcmolistic procession,
ft will be observed that the Democrats and
Populists, while they are following the same
leader, are standing with their backs to each
other, and the former are advancing while the
latter are retreating. It will be observed also
from the mottoes they carry that each party
believes it is marching In a different direction
from the other. In the foreeround is Bryan,
carrying in his hand the campaign motto,
'Where'm I at?'
"This closes the entertainment, ladies and
gentlemen. It will reopen in precisely ten
minutes, and everybody is invited to return
and pay the price of admission. The Demo
cratic band will now strike up. Attention ia
called to the fHCt that thib in the oniy band in
the country which can play two tunes at one
and the same time without missing a siugle
note or scaring a single Populist out of the
tent With married Populists It is different.
Their teeth are more apt to be cut."
A Willing Sacrifice.
Fresno Repub lean.
A ropulist sat with a Pancake on bis knife
blade, preparatory to eating it.
"Alas!" quoth the Pancake.
"Why do you say -Alas 7 *" the Populist
asked.
"Because I am about to be swallowed."
"I used to dread it. too," the Populist mus
ingly responded ere the Pancake disappeared,
"but it is nothing after you once are down."
Jloral: It is unnecessary to try to make any
body see the moral who has not seen it before
this time.

No Middle Ground.
Stockton Mail.
There is no "middle of tbe road" in this
campaign. A man must be either for gold or

MONEY OF THE RICH.
Philadelphia Inquirer.
One of the great arguments of the Populists
is that gold is the money of the banks, the
money-lenders and the wealthy classes. Even
if this were true, is the best money any too
good for the wage-earner? Should he be con
teuted with dollars worth only half dollars?
"Oh!" cries the Populist, "but the capitalist
holds the money and corners it. It is capital
against labor." We deny it; it is not so. Look
at the facts.
Capital, for instance, has built the railroads.
Do a few capitalists own these roads? By no
means. Stock is held in small quantities by
thousands upon thousands. Trust funds for
widows and orphans are invested. Besides,
thsse railroads employ a preat army of men
and support countless families. Were it not
for the capital employed â the cepltalaccumu
lated and paid in by the thousands of in
vestorsâ wn>re would we be as a country and
wtiat would these employes do for a living?
Every mill is run by capital. When a mill
closes its doors does it bring joy? Is there a
general jollification over the downfall of the
employer? Or is there not grief in many a
home? Does it not mean untold suffering?
When the mill is working on full time there is
happiness in the come of the employe, and yet
every mill, every railroad, everything which
involves the payment of wages is run by tbe
gold money, not oi the feir but of the people â
the money in wbieh they are paid or its equiv
alent.
In 1895 the savings Danks held $1,844,357,
--000 in deposits. Who owned these deposits?
The rich man? No. Savings banks are con
ducted for the benefit of those in moderate
Circumstances, as are also the building and
loan associations. There is $750,000,000 in
vested there. These investments build the
poor man his Uttie home. They represent so
much gold, and yet the Populists tell us that
gold is not the poor man's money.
It is. Under the gold standard we have prac
tical bimetallism. We carry as much silver as
we do gold, and the promises of tbe Government
to maintain the standard make the silver dol
lar equal to the gold as money. The free silver
theory obliterates these promises and relieves
the Government from all responsibility to
maintain silver at a parity with gold. The
silver miners take their bullion to the mints
and receive stamped dollars in return. The
Government instead of acting as a banker
and maintaining its credit, simply acts as a
coinage agent. It does not buy silver. It can
not buy. What would it buy with? With the
flood of white metal dumped at the treasury
anors where would it get all the money to pay
for all this bullion? Under free silver it
merely coins into money bullion sent to it by
tbe owner. With no Government credit back
of these silver coins they would become valu
able only at the market; price for the bullion
they contain.
What, then, would happen? Instead of be
ing paid in money equal to gold the railroad
and mill employes and every man on a salary
would receive silver dollars worth only their
market value as bullion â now about 53 cents.
The gold, or the equivalent of gold, deposl ed
in Havings banks -and building associations
would not be returned to the depositors. The
return would be made in these half-dollar sil
ver dollars, and sharp and sure disaster would
follow.
That is what a change of policy would mean
and then ia absolutely no other outcome.

ENTIRE GROUP IN MOURNING.
All the Vessels in the "Blackbirding"
Scheme Have Met With
Disaster.
"Those whom the Gods love die young."
If the quotation is true then the Gods
! must love the natives of the Gilbert group.
! They were beguiled from their island
'. homes to the plantations of Central
i America and there they died. Not in ones
I or twos, or tens and twenties, but in
I hundreds, and out of 1000 men, women
; and children who left Butamari four
j years ago only 227 lived to reach home.
j The humid weather which prevails in
Central America was too much for them j
and they succumbed one by one. In some j
! cases it was pneumonia, but in the ma- I
jority it was consumption which carried
them off. The" latter disease was even j
more prevalent than the former, and it i
! counted its victims by the score each
1 month.
All that was left of the "blackbirds"
were taken home on the bark Helen W.
I Almy, and there was weeping and wailing,
i mingled with tears of joy, at every point
I at which the vessel stopped to unload her
human freight.
The story began ntarly five years ago.
The coffee-planters ot Guatemala wanted
cheap labor, and the} contracted with
j Captain Ferguson for so many South Sea
I Islanders. The skipper chariered the brig 1
Tahiti and sent her out on a cruise. !
"Blackbirding" was and is a common |
practice in the South Seas, and ail the 1
labor employed in the canefields of
i Queensland, Australia, is thus recruited.
I Ferguson had thus no difficulty in secur
ing 270 natives, after which the Tahiti
was headed for San Jose de Guatemala.
She was driven north as far as Drakes j
Bay, and after refitting made another j
start with Captain Ericsson in command. |
The next news came from Mexico, and was
to the effect that the Tahiti had capsized
I and every one on board drowned.
Nothing daunted, Ferguson chartered
I the steamer Montserrat and sent her to
I the Gilbert group. The people were wary
and demanded information as to where
their relatives were. Specious answers were
given, and finally with the assistance of
the King of the group nearly 800 men,
won en and children signed contracts to
work four years in the coffee plantations
of Guatemala. Only 225 of them lived to <
I tell the tale, and they went home on the
I bark Helen W. Almy. The vessel took
i aboard 227, all told, but as there were two
births and two deaths during the voyage '
the total was not changed.
The Almy made an unusually long voy
age and returned to port light. In talk
ing about the matter yesterday Captain
Pedersen said: "The bark was very foul
and it's lucky we are in even now. \Vtaen
we left San Francisco we were all right,
but during the time we lay at Ocos and
San Jose de Guatemala the barnacles grew
six inches every six hours. We expected
a big crowd of South Sea Islanders, but
only 227 all told were put aboard. Half
of them were sick and dispirited, but as
soon as we got to sea they picked up and
were as jolly as sand boys. Outside of the
two deaths from consumption and the two
births there was nothing of interest dur
ing the voyage.
' v The homes of the natives were scattered
over the entire Gilbert group and we had
to co to at least a dozen islands before we
got rid of our passengers. Every place we
touched at we could hear the mournful
death song as soon as the natives
were landed and if we stayed there any
length of time the bark would be sur
rounded by canoes, in which were the j
relatives of the men who perished in
Guatemala. They asked for this man and
that woman and were so persistent ihat
we had to up anchor and get away as
quickly as possible.
"I can state positively that the natives
were well treated in Guatemala and every
one of those who returned with me had
more money with him than he had ever
seen in all his life before. The money
earned by those who died was sent to their
relatives, so there was plenty of silver in
circulation when we left Butantari. Had
it not been for this it would have gone
hard with the Gilbert Islanders.
"There has been no rain tor months and ,
the cocoanuts were not as bie as my fist.
There was no copra, and we could not have
done any trading even if we wanted to.
The British Government runs the group, '
and in order to do any business we would
have had to put up $500 for a license. The
old King, who came to San Francisco a
few years ago, is dead and his 16-year-old
son . reigns in his stead. The new King
is a progressive lad and he sought to rule
his kingdom as he thought fit. The Brit- '
ish Commissioner sat down on him heavy,
however. The young monarch was told ;
that if he did not behave himself lie would ,
be sent to school at Fiji to learn manners. ,
That settled the matter and young Tom
bola has been a most obedient lad ever
since.
"The bark's bottom was very foul, so I
decided to have it partially cleaned while
we were at anchor in Butaritari. Eignt
natives went down and removed barnacles
at least two feet long. They went down
naked and would remain below all of two
minutes at a time.
"Half-castes who attempted the work
could not remain under water more than
a minute. Had we not got the hull par
tially cleaned it might have been another
month before we reached.San Francisco."
The Helen W. Almy was specially char
tered to take the Gilbert Islanders home.
It was part of Captain Blackburn's con
tract that be return the natives, but as
hie vessel foundered off Cape Flattery and
he and every soul on board went down
with her, there was nothing left to be done
save charter another craft to carry out the
agreement. Misfortune seems to have
followed all engaged in the venture.
Nearly a thousand natives died from
swamp fever or exposure or went down in
the wreck of the Tahiti. Two vessels
with ail hands were lost, and the Almy
after a seven months' cruise returned here
in ballast. It will be many a long day be
fore another successful blackbirding cruise
I can be made to the Gilbert group.

THE FAIR ESTATE.
Big Fees Allowed the Executors and
the Attorneys Who Are Em
ployed by Them.
The third account of the Fair estate has
been filed by the executors. It covers the
period from January 1 to June 30, 1896, in
clusive, the total receipts during that
time were $269,310 26- The disbursements,
including $82,526 85. The surrender value
of Monongahela River Railroad Com
pany's bonds and scrip, amounted to $274,
--004 53, leaving a balance in tha hands of
the executors of $382,288 43. This money
is deposited in bank, principally in the
Nevada Bank and the Farmers' Loan and
Trust Company of New York.
An interesting feature of the report filed
is the monthly profit received from the
Lick House. This hostelry paid to the
estate a dividend varying from $62 50 to
$1000 during the past six months.
Judt-e Slack yesterday signed an order
directing the special administrators of the
estate to pay $5000 to Pierson & Mitchell
and $2500 to Garret; McEnÂ«rney for ser
vices rendered as attorneys in the case.
The surviving special administrators were
also allowed $5000 each on account of ser
vices. Warren & Malley, contractors,
were allowed $12,000 due them on account
of the North Beach contracts.
Up to date the special administrators
have recei\ed $20,000 each, as have Pterson
& Mitchell. Garret McEnerney has re
ceived $10,000 and L. C. Bresse, the admin
istrator who died recently, received
$15,000.
HONORED BY THE LADIES
Company M, League of the Cross
Cadets, Given an Ameri
can Flag.
An Interesting Ceremony in St. Fran*
cis Hall When the Emblem
Was Pres nted.
The large hall of St. Francis Church, at
Vallejo street and Montgomery avenue,
was thronged last evening when the young
ladies of St. Francis parish presented
Company M, League of the Cross Cadets,
with a beautiiul American flag. The flag
itself was sufficient to arouse ti.e latent
enthusiasm and patriotism of those
present. It is a gorgeous banner of silk,
fringed with gold tassels and supplemented
by streamers bearing the name of the
company. There could be no doubting
the sincere interest shown in the proceed
ings, not alone by the boys themselves,
who are pledged to temperance, but by
the girls, who were present in large num
bers to present tne flag, and also by the
grown people.
The hall was decorated with ferns and
sprays of flowers, while the platform was
draped with National flags and otherwise
beautified with flowers.
Rev. Father Caraher, pastor of the par
ish, presided, and with him on the stage
were seated the officers of Company M.
The flag was presented by Miss K.
Camp Dell and received by Captain T. J.
Dinan. In her appropriate presentation
address Miss Campbell said it was a pleas
ant duty she had to perform in addressing
Company M in behalf of the ladies who
took this opportunity of expressing their
heartfelt appreciation of the good work of
the league. She congratulated Company
M on its fidelity to principle, admired its
perseverance and assured it they would
always find the young ladies of St. Francis
parish ready and willing to aid Company
M in any work it would undertake to pro
mote the cause of temperance.
Captain Dinan replied for his company,
offering the thanks of his comrades for
the beautiful emblem. He said that the
presentation showed that the ladies in
dorsed the movement represented by Com
pany M, and that its members were
watched by friendly eyes; it also gave
them moral support and encouragement
which aided them to keep their pledges.
He further promised that the flag would
be regarded as one of the chief treasures
of the company, and he hoped that in
future the same flag would inculcate les
sons of patriotism in the minds of the
members of Company M.
Father Caraher told the audience that
the ceremonies gave him great pleasure
because it was an outburst of patriotism.
"Cadets of the League of the Cross," he
said, "yon have been honored by the
ladies of your parish, and it is expected
that your conduct will be an honor to
yourselves, an ornament to religion and
an example of the virtue of temperance."
It was announced that a grand rally
would be given Sunday at 2 p. m. in the
Mechanics' Pavilion, at which all mem
bers of the- league and the full cadet regi
ment would be present. Admission will
be free to everybody. The principal fea
ture will be an essay contest for the Arch
bishop's medal. Archbishop Riordan will
deliver the address.

BAITING THE COD
IN HIS SEA-LAIR.
How Morrhua Americana
Is Taken In Out of
the Wet.
HIS FOE THE DORYMAN.
The Fish That Grazes in the
Submarine Fields for
Science.
A GOOD STRING OF DOLLARS.
Packing-House of the Lynde-Hongh
F.sh Company at California
City.
A codfish is never more happy than
when be in hung to a line. He will travel
a hundred marine leagues if he hears that
some man in a little fishing dory has a
hook out. He never learns that the
dainty, juicy morsel swinging to and fro
thirty or forty fathoms down in the sea
conceals a steel barb. His ancestors have
successively gone on making the same un
pardonable mistake ever since the waters
of the great deep were gathered together.
Other creatures, in the light of a dreadful
experience, have picked up an instinct
that there is danger in a hook, but
the cod does not, and is pulled
in. And his. family of youngstersâ he
leaves behind thousands of them â sooner
or later will follow him into a cask.
So the chap in the dory drifting quietly
over the bank watches his two lines and
awaits the inevitable jerk which tells of
the presence of the voracious morrhua.
He knows that if the signal nibble does
not come soon that coa has other fish to
fry, because it is always eating or going to
eat. It is the marine personification of
famine and starves with its stomach full
of food. Old fishers say that a cod will
gulp down a baited hook with his raout:i
filled with a salmon he has just caught.
There have been several cases where this
gourmand of the seas has managed to get
away with a hooK, sinker and several
fathoms of heavy line to be caught a few
minutes later by new fishing tackle.
Notwithstanding the fearful mortality
among this fish, so anxious to get caught
that only the most remarkable error on
its part can save its life, it defies extermi
nation. It spawns and swarms and thick
ens the sea with itself. It has been said
that if tne cod's many enemies ceased
working on him, and if he did not die
himself from overeating, he and the dif
ferent members of his family would soon
fill the ocean from bottom to surface and
from shore to shore. In fact there would
be no more sea.
Being a juicy, delectable morsel is not
the only good" thing that can be said of
this fish of the genus Gadus. He has an
insatiable appetite for scientific research,
and an exploration within his almost un
fathomable stomach has revealed the flora
and fauna of a life existing far down in
the soundless deeps. While he is discuss
ing a breakfast of mussels with seaweed
on the side he is laboring in the cause of sci
ence, and when David Starr Jordan hooks
him out of his great, watery dining-room
he will be the means of adding much to
the roster of the vegetable and animal
kingdom of the sea.
One of the companies on this coast that
have taken advantage of the seeming desire
on the part of the codfish to get caught is
the Lyncte & Hough Company of San
Francisco. They have a packing estab
lishment at California City, where their
three vessels â the schooner Arago and tlie
barKentines Fremont and Falkenbergâ
refit and discharge.
The schooner got in from Bering Sea
recently with 72,000 hs!Â» salted down in
nice white flakes in her holdâ the Falken
berg with 115,000â and a lew days ago the
Fremont sailed through the Golden Gate
and up along the Marin shore to the end
of her summer outing with hook and line
with a catch of 170,000 fish. And so the
three vessels brought home a heavy string
of 357,000 Bering cod, and they were not
bought in a fish market, either.
Each vessel is provided with a crew of
twenty or thirty men, a few beine: cutters
and salters, who remain aboard the vessel
while the rest man the dories and fish.
The dory is a sharpat-both-ends flat
bottomed boat and is propelled by two
oars and a sail of light material. This
latter is only used to run before the wind,
as the cranky flat-bottomed craft could
not sail on a wind. The doryman takes
his station on the cod bank and dropping
his anchor overboard he lets his two lines
with the four hooks run out in the sea.
They go down deeplyâ 4o fathoms, where
the big cod growâ and he awaits further
developments. Tney come quickly if
there are any cod about, for a Bering cod
never lets a hook with its chunk of fat
halibut go begging.
As he is yanked upward with the barb
pulling at his lip liis great mouth opens j
wide and the water flowing into his 1
stomach and lungs generally drowns him.
Even if not dead he is so helpless and so [
spiritless that it seems to be a charity to
take him in out of the wet.
When the school is present there is no
time lost in their efforts to get on to the
hooks and the man in the dory has no
time to sit down and pnjoy the sea scenes
around him. Frequently a line will come
up with a fish on each of its two hoofcx
and two or three free fish following their
captive brothers to the surface in hopes
that they can take the lucky (?) fellows'
places should they get loose from the
hooks.
This, of course, suits the doryman, as it
helps him to earn his $25 per thousand,
and when he has loaded his cranky boat
down to the danger point he hurries to
the ship. Here the cod is immediately
throated, that is cut across the throat and
a portion of its backbone taken out. It is
then passed on to another chap, by
whom it is beheaded, split down the belly
and cleaned. The fish is laid open, washed
in sea water and packed away in salt.
Care must be taken here, as too much of
the sodium-chloride will burn the cargo
and too little will turn it into a putrefying
mass. Then the vessel sails for the dis
tant packing-house.
At California City the fish are again
washed, and the inside skin peeled off.
These peelings, with the outside skin, are
utilized in the manufacture of glue. But
little is lost in a cod, and he is worked up
for all he is worth. The fish is then laid
away in the pickling tanks, where he rests
in his bath of brine till wanted for mar
ket. Then he is dried, trimmed and fitted
nicely in his case with a number of his
fellows and JaDeled for commerce. No
effort is made on the coast to use the
livers for oil, as on the great Eastern
banks.
In the Lynde-Hough Company, the
catchers being paid $25 per 1000, men with
little experience make good wages. Fre
quently the doryman, with his two lines,
will haul in eight or ten thousand cod
during his six weeks' or two months' fish
ing â this is a straight fish story â and
come home after his season's angling with
a good string of dollars.
But sometimes the schools are off on a
vacation and no knowledge of tne iaws of
migration can tell just where they are
swimming. The hooks swing idly down
under the forty- fathom ocean and not the
tiniest jar of a nibble comes up to the man
in the dory. Good and bad luck strike the
chap who baits the cod in his deep-sea
lair.

ANOTHER COUPLE
MARRIED AT SEA,
Ran Away From Willows
to Escape Parental
Wrath.
CHASED TO THIS GITT.
The Tug Was Only Half an Hour
at Sea When Relatives
Arrived.
WHERE IS THE THEOBALD?
Sbe Is Now 35 Days Out From Cooks
Inlet and Fears for Her Safety
Are Entertained.
Another runaway couple was wedded on
the high seas yesterday. Both of them
were very, very sick and the bride had to
be held on her feet while the ceremony
was being performed.
The groom's name is Oscar Waugh and
that of the bride was Edna A. Minton. They
came from Willows, Glenn County, and
were only haJf an hour away from the wharf
when relatives of the young lady drove up
in hot haste, eager to stop the ceremony.
They were too late, and at 4 p. m. by the
clock Mr. Waugh and Miss Minton were
man and wife.
Early in the morning a stranger ap
proached Captain W. E. Gage of the gaso
line schooner Hettie B. and asked him
whether he would marry a couple at sea.
A graphic description of two lovers in dis
tress was drawn and when proof was
brought that everything was fair and
above board and that only obdurate par
ents stood in the way Gage gave in. When
the young couple appeareu they were ac
companied by John Rattigan and Mrs. L.
Rattigan, these two being the witnesses to
the ceremony. Beside these Captain Gage
insisted upon having two witnesses of his
own, so there can be no doubt the couple
have been securely bound.
Once beyond the heads the Hettie B
plunged into a stiff head sea. Everybody
got sick, but Captain Gage held on his way
until the three-league limit was passed.
Then he called all hands into the cabin
aud the ceremony was performed. Mr.
and Mrs. Waugh are now debating in
their own minds about returning home.
Waugh is not at all certain as to what kind
of a reception he will receive, while his
wife is only too anxious to face the in
evitable and have it all over. The chances
are that the couple will start for Willows
to-morrow.
"What has become of the bark Theo
bald?" is the question that everybody is
asking on the waterfront. She is now out
thirty-five days from Cooks Inlet, and the
general impression is that she should have
got in Jong ago. Captain Swan is an ex
perienced master, and on him many
people rely to bring the vessel into pore.
On the run from San Francisco to Alaska
with a party of miners the Theobald had a
very rough time and came near being
wrecked. Her sails were blown from the
bolt-ropes and a considerable portion of
her bulwarks was washed away.
The schooner Carrier Dove came off the
ways yesterday and is again in commis
sion. Captain Klusmann, son of the old
time skipper, says he has now one of the
smartest vessels on the bay, and that he
is ready to give any craft in her class a
race.
Commodore R. J. R. Aden of the Piper,
Aden, Goodall Company's fleet, Mayor of
Adenvill and a well-known ship-owner
and merchant of Vallejo, was on the front
yesterday. Mayor Aden is a firm believer

WILLOWS, Cal., Aug. 7.â The usually
quiet and peaceable rural precincts of
Clarks Valley and the large possessions of
J. R. Garnett in the southwestern portion
of this county are fairly apog with wild
rumors and speculations over the prob
able whereabouts of Oscar Waugh, a man
about 35 years old, and Miss Edna Minton,
a pretty and only daughter of Perry
Minton, a prominent farmer, who resides
twelve miles from Willows. Every in
dication points to elopement, but not
withstanding most diligent inquiries and
search having been made all efforts have

HOW FREE TRADE WOULD HURT THE IRON INDUSTRY.
It bas been shown in a series of articles
in The Call that the Democratic free
trade policy, so volubly championed by
William Jennings Bryan, has brought ruin
wherever it has touched, particularly in
the wool, lumber and sugar industries. It
is now proposed to show in a brief and
general way how protection aids and how
free trade harms the various branches of
the iron and steel industriesâ the heavi
est in the United States.
It should be borne in mind at the outset
that it may always be assumed as a gen
eral proposition that iron is the basis of
all manufacturing, and whatever hurts
the iron business hurts the entire coun
try.
If the cheap iron and steel manufac
tories of pauper labor countries are al
lowed to come into America free of duty
the result is to destroy the iron and ateel
industries of the country, or â almost as
badâ to reduce the wages of American
workingmen to a mere living basis, as
hard and cruel as tha iron law of wages
announced by Ricardo, where men work
by comDulsion at the lowest sum that will
enable them to subsist.
Before submitting any evidence from
people who have engaged in the iron
business, it is well to bear in mind the
important fact that in nearly every form
of iron product the element of human
labor constitutes nearly 90 per cent of the
value; hence it is not difficult to see that
cheap iron, free from foreign countries, is
a direct blow at American workingmen.
The policy of William Jennings Bryan,
\s conclusively shown in his moat im
portant Congressional speeches, is one
lavoring free trade in raw materials, as
well as in the manufactured articles of
commerce. It requires but a superficial
study of the question to show that such a
policy is directly in favor of the doctrines
of the Cobden Clubâ or.c of the rankest
free-traders from the earliest yeais of the
contest between protection and free trade
in America â the one a symbol of pros
perity, the other a symbol of ruin.
It cannot be denied that England and
Germany are great iron and steel produc
ing countries. They furni3h a great pro
portion of the world's finished steel prod
ucts in machinery andj cutlery.; Every
dollar's worth of such goods imported into
America is a direct blow at American in
dustry and a peril to American labor.
Wbyt Chiefly because the American
manufacturer* cannot compete with the
world's markets if he pays the standard of
waees obtaining in tbe United States.
English wages are more than 60 per
cent lower than those in America, then
how can American workmen make iron
products to compete with those of England
unless they accept the .vages down to the
English scale? What that scale would be
under Bryan's free-trade ideas may be
eeen to best advantage by a glance at the
condition of the wage-earners in the great
manufacturing centers of England. Here
are a few pictures of those conditions that
Bryan's free-trade ideas would bring to
America. Johu Ruskin says:
"Though England is deafened with
WATER CRESS IN
CITY SEWAGE,
An Industry That Thrives
Out in the Mis
sion.
MAY SOON BE STOPPED.
Two Improvement Clubs Will
Fight Against the
Swamp.
MÂ£NACE TO PUBLIC HEALTH.
' The City Authorities Will B2 Askei
to Take Immediate Ac
tion.
The Potrero Nuevo Improvement Club
and the .Potrero - avenue Improvement
Club are discussing the project of abating
â what is regarded by their members as the
worst nuisance in all San Francisco â the
rioisome swamps or lakes of sewage in the
vicinity of Army street and San Bruno
road. It is the purpose of these energetic
bodies to press the matter persistently in
the proper quarters until the nuisance is
abated or entirely abolished.
Incidentally this action on the part of
the improvement clubs will be a fatal
Btab at a quite remunerative industry that
has been carried on in thestvaiHD for some
time.
The property -owners, however, care
nothing for this, all they want is a health
ful neighborhood without a large sunken
area full of reeking sewage from munici
pal and private sewers.
The industry in question is the peculiar
one of gathering baskets of freeh water
cresses for the markets. Early in the
mornings men may be seen in the marsh
plucking watercress, which they bring to
town in baskets to supply restaurants,
vegetable-venders or regular customers.
The pungent cress is always green and
fresh, and consequently commands a ready
Bale. And yet the knowledge of its cul
ture in this particular instance prevents
many people from touching any water
cress offered for sale in town.
Throughout the year the swamp at
Twenty-sixth street invariaoly looks bat
ter than it smells, for it is covered with a
luxuriant green growth that has all the
appearance of a well-kept lawn, and' the
Â»iush beneath is hidden from the eyt>. At
one time there was an extensive frog pond
there and it supplied epicures with the
delicacy of frogs' legs.
The water-cress, however, spread all over
the ooze, and so the frogs were driven to
the wall. It was then that the cress
gatherers appeared upon the scene.
A physician stated to one of the mem
bers of the Potrero-avenue Improvement
Club that there was grave danger of dis
ease from germs on the stalks or leaves
that touch the sewage. This was strength
ened by the statement that the Pesthouse
sewer empties into the hollow, from
which there is no outlet.
The dangerous swamp covers an area of
Â»bout four blocks, bounded by Army,
Twenty-sixth and Alabama streets and
Ban Bruno road. Within 100 yards is the
Twenty-sixth Street Hospital and a few
blocks off on the northeast the City and
County Hospital. Many humble dwell
ings have been built almost on the edge of
the sewage hole and the blocK around are
(airly well filled with homes.
The owners of these places are loudest
A Protective Tariff Is Shown to Be the American
Ironworkers' Safeguard Against
Pauperism*
spinning-wheels, her people have not
clothes; though she is black with the dip
ping of fuel, they die of cold, and, though
she has sold her soul for grain, they die of
hunger."
This is one picture of the condition of
the masses in the rich manufacturing re
gions â in the very heart of the iron indus
try of the British isle. Lest the critic ob
ject to one man's evidence, let that of
another be submitted before it is shown
by the testimony of iron-men what is
meant when it is stated that free trade
would reduce American workmen to the
British level. Bennet Burleigh says:
"There is no gainsaying the existence,
rich and potent as the British empire is,
of widespread privation among the work
ing classes of Great Britain. This distress
has now become a constant, an aggra
vated quantity. Men, women and chil
dren, by hundreds of thousands, miserably
half-clad, have to face the chill English
winter, hibernating as best they can iv
dark, frowzy abodes, from which they
emerge but to plead for bread. 1 '
That is a picture of the condition of
workmen in lree-trade England. It is the
contention of Republicans and particu
larly of McKinley that the free-trade
panacea poisons the patient, that it ruins
industry and impoverishes the working
mao. There are signal illustrations of
this in the steel and iron business of the
country.
Daring the free-trade regime of 1860
the wages of iron and steel workers aver
aged $355 a year, but under the protection
of 1880 they went to $390, while the cost of
necessaries decreased so greatly as to
make a still greater saving to the working
man. According to Edward Atkinson, the
well-known statistician, the wages of
American workingmen increased from
$468 to $720 per year between 1860 and
188 a These figures are enough to make
the thoughtful voter hesitate before in
dorsing even a mild form of Bryanism.
The iron industry of the United States
is already ereat, but under the influence
of a judicious protective tariff it might be
made far more important in every brancn.
There are hundreds of ramifications of the
trades and enterprises that depend for
their success on the production of iron un
der favorable conditions. It enters into
nearly every phase of industrial and do
mestic life, from the great steel bridges to
the can\bric needle, from the scissors of
the housewife to thÂ« sword of the soldier,
and wherever free trade destroys the en
terprises dependent on this universal ore
it reduces the workmen to penury.
It was recently shown by the manager of
the Los Angeles Rolling Mills that a few
in their protests against the negligence 01
the Supervisors and the Board of Health,
in not taking the action which they claim
is an absolute necessity to preserve the
public health from the menace hanging
over the district. President J. D. Horan
and L. J. Dwyer of the Potrero-avenue
Club are taking the lead in the movement
against the swamp.
"We shall bring it before the Board of
Health," said Mr. Dwyer, "and demand
that something be done in the premises as
a sanitary measure. Our plan is to have
Potrero avenue extended to Army street,
as by that means a proper sewerage sys
tem would be secured. After that our
clubs will fight for a continuance of the
large brick sewer in Army street out to the
water. If this be not done in the course
of a year, at least, there is no telling what
pestilence may arise from the place.
Meanwhile, this water-cress business, I
think, should be stopped."
Reduced Kates on Powder.
To meet tbe reduction made in the rate on
powder and high explosives from points in the
Missouri Valley to Montana, the Southern
Pacific will put in a lower rate to the same
section. Effective on tbe 10th inst., it will
put in force from San Francisco and powder
points in California a rate of $1 30 per hun
dred pounds on these commodities in carload
lots of not less than twelve tons, to Montana
common points, north of and including Silver
Bow. This is a reduction of $1 20 on the ex
isting rate. The rate from the Missouri Val
ley was $2 95, and was reduced to $1 75.

simple things might make California a
great iron and steel producing center,
probably the headquarters for many thriv
ing manufacturing enterprises. The fac
tors he reckoned were protection, cheap
coke and cheap transportation.
With a railroad leading to the great
coking coal regions of Southwest Utah,
with iron mountains in Southern Califor
nia, and a tariff to Keep out the pauper
made goods of Europe and Canada even,
there is scarcely any limit to the pros
perity that might coma to California as
an iron and steel manufacturing center.
But under the policy of Bryanism there
would be no future for such enterprises in
California, and nothing but decay and
ruin for those already established in
Pennsylvania and the populous iron re
gions of the East and South.
The Cambria Iron Company of Johns
town, Pa., made a reply to the Tariff
Commissioners of 1894, wherein it put
forth the following clear statement of the
tariff problem as it affects iron :
"We wish to enter a protest for our
selves, and on behalf of the manufactur
ing industries of the country, against
the theory that the present depression of
industry is caused by delay in passing the
Wilson bill. The bill itself is the cause,
and we prefer that the delay shall last
forever. The present situation is less in
tolerable than would be our condition un
der the Wilson bill as a law. We don't
propose to jump into the river to get out
of the rain. The present bill is the product
of an obsolete system of political economy.
Its laws, once esteemed to be universal
and eternal, are new everywhere discred
ited, and are most particularly and
definitively disputed and denied by the
younger school of English scientists. The
alleged natural aud divine laws by which
the dominant party is endeavoring to reg
ulate the industries and finances of the
United States are as completely obsolete
to-day as the Ptolemaic system of astron
omy. No civilized country has adopted
free trade. The whole tendency of legis
lation on the continent of Europe and in
tbe English colonies is in tbe way of
strengthening tariff defenses. Generally
the affairs of nations have been managed
by men of affairs, and no country other
than the United States has ever given con
trol of its fiscal legislation to theorists."
But to baud the iron industry over to
William Jennings Bryan would be surren
dering every principle of business acumen
and giving the reins of government to a
dreamer pure and simple.
Another testimonial in point, showing
how the reduction of business to a free
trade level works disasters, is seen in the
thin and gray. He was formerly and for
many years engaged in the wholesale
grocery business in Truckee, Sacramento
and this City. He resides on Oak street
He was arrested some months ago on
the charge of altering and changing trans
fer checks of the Post-strset line, pasting
over the punched marks and changing the
date ana presenting them for passage.
When arrested a considerable number of
old punched checks were found on his
person.
J. W. Dubois, the conductor on the car,
who took up the altered check, brought
the charge, and was, of course, the chief
witness. He testified that Mr. Bell had
upon several occasions offered him simi
larly altered checks. J. J. Coleman tes
tified that he was on the car at the time
and the conductor called his attention to
the man and the check. That was all the
evidence against Bell.
For his own part Bell testified in a
fiank manner that he knew nothing
about the alterations; that be got the
check from a newsboy as he was in the
habit of doing every evening with bis
newspaper. He explained his having the
other checks by saying that his son at
school had requested him to save them
for nim as a chum of his was making a
collection of them. A feature of the hear
ing was the calling of Black Ryan, tax
agent of the Southern Pacific Company, to
testify to the good character of the de
fendant. He dia so unreservedly; say
ina: that previous to this case he had
never heard a breath of evil against him.
Stephen Gage was also to be summoned in
the same interest Ryan said that Gage
would testify as he (Ryan) had done, he
was sure, as they had talked the matter
over. They had both known Bell for the
past thirty years. The prosecution con
sented to accept the evidence without
Bummonine: the witness,
George W. Condee, Isaac M. Baker, J. D.
Dufoale and other well-known citizens
testified as to the man's previous good
character. The jury was out but a few
moments and returned with a verdict of
not guilty.
There is another case against the old
man, crowing out of similar circumstan
ces. It may or may not be tried.
The Williams Estate.
Thomas H. Williams Jr. has petitioned the
Probate Court for an order directing George E.
WilliamF, executor cf the will of Thomas H.
Williams Sr., to allow him to choose property
which may be vested for his interest. The
will provides that the children of the deceased
may so choose, by lot or agreement, from the
estate, but as all are dead except Thomas H.
Williams Jr. and a son of his deceased sister,
Mary Bryant Johnson, this has never been
done.
evidence of 0. D. Lucas & Co. of Green
ville, Ohio, manufacturers of small engines
and boilers. They say :
"If the rate of duty is reduced one-third
the cost of production will havo to be re
duced nearly as much. As I understand
the present tariff on our goods, the foreign
prices and ours are very nearly the same
at this place. Any reduction in the tariff
means a reduction in the selling price of
our goods, and which cannot be fully made
Jip by free raw material."
Yet the policy of Mr. Bryan is to make
all these things absolutely free. That
policy would absolutely enslave every
man engaged in working for another in
the iron industry.
Here is another opinion, this time from
the sunny South, home of the late free
trade chimera. The Bristol Iron and Steel
Company of Bristol, Term., says:
"We thin* the passage of the proposed
Wilson bill will be disastrous to the man
ufacturing interests of this country, par
ticularly to those near the seaboard. A
duty of 22% per cent will permit foreign

possible to reduce wages enough in this
country to Keep our works in operation.
A duty of only 10 per cent on scrap iron
will permit large quantities of it to come
in, taking the place of domestic iron, and
also open the way to frauds in classing
iron as scrap that is only broken up for
that purpose."
How well this company foresaw the
coming of disaster is seen in the present
depressed condition of the country, with
millions of workmen idle and a large per
centage of the factories of the country
closed.
The Lehigh Steel and Iron Company of
Allentown, Pa., manufacturers of pig iron,
show how the beneficent influences of pro
tection are necessary to prevent the ruin
of Americans. They say :
"English pie iron is worth 35 to 36 shill
ings per ton, r. o. b. vessel, equal to about
$8 per ton in our money. Add $1 20 to
$1 50 per ton for ocean freight, and this
foreign iron will cost in New York and all
our other Eastern seaport and tidewater
towns $9 to $9 50 per ton, while the cost
delivered in these Eastern markets from
the furnaces of Alabama, Georgia, North
Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia Mary
land, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York
and New Jersey will average from
$12 to $13 per ton. There sr^ould
be added to this $1 25 to $1 50
per ton for interest on the capital in
vested in the plant. These figures are
based on conditions which yield no profit
to the miner, quarryrnan or furnaceman.

MANGLED HIS HEAD
WITH A SHOTGUN,
Revolting Suicide of Ches
ter D. Kenison, a
Mere Boy.
HE WAS JUST EIGHTEEN
Placed the Weapon's Muzzle in
His Mouth and Pulled
the Triggep
NO CAUSE FOR THE DEED.
His Parents Are at a Loss to Under
stand the Reasons Prompting
the Rash Act.
Chester D. Kenison, 18 years of age,
son of Asa H. Kenison, a well- to-do milk
dealer, committed suicide in a most re
volting manner in his home, 2952 Twenty
fifth street, last eveninsr at 9 o'clock. The
young man was employed as an apprentice
at the Union Iron Works. He always ap
peared to be contented and satisfied with
bis position.
Yesterday was payday at the iron works,
and, after drawing his salary, Kenison
went home aud turned his money over to
his parents. During the afternoon he
complained of a toothache and declined
to eat any supper. His mother tried to
cheer her son and to ease the pain in his
tooth, but the boy refused to be com
forted.
At 8 o'clock the suicide's parents made
preparations to retire, and advised their
son to do the same; but he refused, say
ing that he could not sleep and would
remain up a short time.
The parents finally retired for the night,
however., and were dozing when they were
awakened by a muffled report. Thinking
that the noise, was that of a slamming
door, they did not get up and investigate.
Louis Cahn, who resides just across the
street from the Kenison dwelling, also
heard the report and concluded that some
one had been shot. He went across the
street and roused Mr. Kenison, ard to
gether they visited the boy'a apartments.
There on the floor ho lay dead.
It W3s a fearful scene. TbÂ« boy's head
was blown to atoms. Nothing remained
of it but a portion of the lower jaw and
right side of the head.
The upper jaw, skull and brain* were
scattered over the bed and floor.
A shotgun of large gauge was lying be
side the bodyâ silent evidence, but telling
only too truly the manner in which the
deed was committed. A string tied to the
muzzle of the weapon and from there to
the boy's foot dispelled any possible idea
of accident and told the story of a suicide.
A note reading "Good-by, mamma
dear," was found on the bed. This was
aIL Not a word that would tend to dis
close the cause of suicida could be found
and in all probability it will never be
known.
Asa Kenison, the boy's father, is heart
broken at his son's action.
Ho is at a loss to understand why he
should have taken his life.
"I wonaer what caused my poor boy to
kill himself," said Mr. Kenison last even
ing, as be looked with streaming eyes on
the mangled remains of his son.
"He was never scolded, and always ap
peared to be happy. He had no love af
fairs that I know of, and nothing in the
have been quickened by restored confi
dence and stability in values, some of the
important items of cost will certainly be
increased $1 50 to $2 per ton. Then we
shall have, with only ordinarily successful
business conditions prevailing, the cost of
American pig iron $14 to $15 per ton de
livered in these Eastern markets, and
where it must compete with English pig
iron, which its producers can sell at a
profit at $9 to $10 per ton. And these
Eastern markets are by far the largest and
best we have in this country. Why this
difference in cost? The answer is simple.
Fully 90 per cent of the cost of the ton of
pig iron is labor or the product oMabor.
As this home labor has during the past
ten years or more cost double that paid by
the furnaces in England, it follows that
this difference must be equalized by a
tariff duty, or wages must be reduced or
our furnaces abandoned."
Continuing, they said that a wise pro
tective tariff would cause prosperity.
"Repeal the Wilson bill," tney said, "and
pass a resolution not to disturb the
present tariff for a number of years, and
the country, North and South.will become
prosperous. Virginia and other Southern
States will become large manufacturers of
iron, steel and textile fabrics. The thou
sands of horsepower of water now run
ning to waste will be utilized in spinning
and weavinc cotton and wool. A reduc
tion in the rate of duties will result in a
reduction in wages, and a corresponding
injury to the home market; for the labor
ing classes are the great consumers of the
country, and a majority of them spend all
they earn. The higher their wages the
more they buy of the gardener, farmer,
manufacturer and merchant. It is not the
interest of these to have low wages."
The way the Wilson bill works is shown
by the evidence of the American Road
Machine Company of Kennett square,
Pennsylvania. They say:
"Canadian manufacturers are able to
make implements at lower cost than
American manufacturers can. At a recent
meeting of agricultural-implement manu
facturers there were presented theexperi
ences of two manufacturers who have
branches of their works in Canada. One
of them stated that he could manufacture
his goods cheaper in Canada than he could
in the United States. Another said that
he should largely increase his manufac
tures in Canada for the purpose of supply
ing his trade in tho United States.
Another large American manufacturer,
when asked to express his views on this
feature of the Wilson bill, stated that he
was indifferent, as if it passed he would
establish a branch of his works in Canada.
Being asked if he would supply his Ameri
can trade therefrom he replied that he
certainly should do so."
Thus it is seen efaat Bryan's ideas of free
trade are not less disastrous to the Ameri
can iron industry than to the lumber and
wool business. Even the cheap labor of
Canada â much dearer than that of Eng
land â is a great injury to this country ;
but under free trade every American
workman would soon be compelled to live
in a way as meager as the poorest English
waee slaveâ a condition of squalor and
suffering that it is the mission of the Re
publican party to avert.
world to worry him. It is awfulâ awful â
but it is too late now to help him."
HIS DIAMOND GROSS.
Daniel McCoy Ila* Been Twice the Vie-
Tim of a Sneakthief Within Four
Months.
Daniel McCoy, a drayman living at 142
Seventh street, is the owner of a diamond
cross valued at several hundred dollars,
which has twice been stolen from him.
About four months ago a sneakthief got
into his room and stole the diamond cross
and a gold watch and chain. McCoy
notified the police, and Detectives Gibson
and "Wren, who were detailed on the case,
found the cross, but the diamonds, eleven
in number, were gone.
McCoy had new diamonds put in the
cross a few clays ago, and locked it up in a
box along with a quantity of jewelry be
longing to a lady friend. The box was
placed for safety in a closet, and McCoy
as a further precaution always kept the
door of his room locked.
Last night when he got home he was
surprised to find the door of his room
open and atill more surprised when he
saw the box lying in the middle of the
floor. He hurriedly picked it up and
found that his diamond cross and his lady
friend's jewelry had been stolen. He at
once notified the police, who will have
another hunt for the diamond cross.
CONTESTANTS GAIN A POINT.
The Opposition to the Probate of the
Will of Mary B. Toland.
The contest of the will of Mary B. To
land was before Judge Slack again yester
day on a motion by the contestants to
strike out certain portions of the answer
of Hugo H. Toland, and on a demurrer to
the entire answer.
His Honor refused to grant the de
murrer, but the motion to strike out was
allowed. It was alleged in the original
contest that Mary B. Toland was not of
sound mind at the time the alleged will
was dated. In the answer to the contest
all the allegations of the contestants were
denied, and for a further auswer it was
alleged that the contest had been dis
missed because of failure to file an
amended contest.
Del mas & Shortridge, on behalf of Wil
liam Gridley Toland, then moved to strike
out certain portions of the answer, which
motion Judge Slack granted.

A WEDDING BROKE
A MOTHER'S HEART
Hermann Braunschweiger
Jr. Marries Sadie
Nichols.
UNITED IN OAKLAND
The Groom Is Said to Have
Been Hilarious at the
Time.
FATHER WILL NOT INTERFERE
He Says He' Will Have Nothing to
Do With the Matter at
All.
Jr., son of
the prosperous wholesale liquor dealer,
was married last Wednesday by Justice of
the Peace Lawrence, in Oakland, to Sadie
Nichols, keeper of the apartment-house at
116 Eddy street.
The members of his family are greatly
shocked and grieved at the young man's
matrimonial venture. Especially is this
the case with his mother, who is almost
prostrated.
The father.Hermann Braunschweiger Sr.
was seen last night at his residence on Mc-
Allister street. "I arrived from Santa
Cruz this evening," said he, "on tbe 7
o'clock train. I first heard of the occur
rence to-day. I have not seen Hermann.
"It is a terrible misfortune, but what
can you do? You may be assured I shall
not interfere with the couple at all. If
any stei,s are to be taken toward nullifica
tion of the marriage I suppose my son
will take them. I wash my hands of the
whole affair.
"Hermann has been rather wild for
some years, but four or five months ago
changed his habits and lived here at the
house and attended to his business in a
manner that was very gratifying to me.
A week ago last Thursday Mrs. Braun
schweiger and myself went on a pleasure
trip to Santa Cruz. We asked Hermann
to accompany us, but he decided to re
main in the City.. My eldest son tells me
that Hermann left the house on the same
day we went to Santa Cruz and has not
returned since. This will prove, I fear,
more than a lesson to him."
It was learned that young Braun
schweiger since Thursday a week ago baa
taken up his quarters at 116 Eddy street,
and was there in the company of Sadie
Nichols during the whole time. He first
met the woman in fact on that Thursday.
Thursday he came into the barroom in
company with Sadie Nichols and said:
"This is my wife, boys, aiyi I want you to
tell everybody that she is, too."
It is stated that he was very much ex
cited at the time.
Last night neither husband nor wife
could be found.
The name of Sadie Nichols has been con
nected publicly with several sensational
cases. A man by the name of Murphy
from San Jose was found dead in this
City, death having been caused by gas as
phyxiation. On his breast was the picture
of Sadie Nichols and a letter to him written
by her. She has also figured in several
police-court cases ol sensational character.
She is described as being an attractive
woman of about 40 years of age. Braun
schweiger is about 24, tall and popular
with his friends.
She is also said to be a woman who has
a practical eye for the main chance, and
one who could scarcely be accredited with
having married for love.
Yesterday Hermann Jr. spoke some
time with his father across the telephone
to San Jose. His mother had also on that
day a long interview with the bride, the
nature of which could not be ascertained.
A TUNNELL CONFESSION,
Mattie Overman's Friend Admits
That Her "Call" Statement
Was True.
A Disputed Interview With Her in
Visalia at Last Acknowledged as
in All Resp2cts Accurate.
Mrs. M. F. Tunnell, Mattie Overman's
friend, who carefully remained in hiding
during the examination of Rev. C. O.
Brown by the Congregational Council,
has come out with an admission that The
Call's position in the matter was abso
lutely correct. Early in the Brown case
The Call obtained an important inter
view with Mrs. Tunnell covering the
points of the present admission. The au
thenticity of the interview was denied in
certain quarters, but has now been fully
established.
JJjero is nothing new in the published
statement of Mrs. Tunnell. It merely in
dorses and confirms The Call's statement
that she was cognizant of Mattie Over
man's illicit relations with Rev. Dr.
Brown, and that she herself had kept oat
of the way on his behalf and at his ex
pense. She denounces the pastor's ingrat
itude to herself and Miss Overman. She
says:
I knew from my own personal knowledge
that the Rev. Dr. C. O. Brown had lovea Mattie
Overman as it rarely falls to the lot of woman
to be loved. Like a man bereft of all he holds
dear on earth Dr. Brown has cried out in the
bitterness of his spirit for just one more look of
Mat tie's face. He would have given $1000, he
said, for another kiss.

When Mattie returned from Tacoma. I was
shocked at her changed appearance. > Her de
termination to come back to learn the truth
from Dr. Brown's own lips was carried out to
the letter. ;* If he ; had i been ' false ! to her she
wanted revenge, for her Christianity was lost
her life blighted and ruined by a man who
should have been the one to build up and pro
tect the pure, the true and the holy. ;-'â  "He has
robbed me of my happiness," she would cry
and my heart < went out in bitterness against
the man. ;!- ; â¢ .' ''vi.v.- ' â ''â  â  <â¢. .â¢â â ..â ----.
\rs Mattie and I went together to Dr. Brown's
office. Â£ : He was cold and heartless, and finally
cried out: "God has forgiven me; cannot she?"
Mattie was softened by his tears and returned
home itn tn e - She was weeping and broken
in spirit. ? Dr. Brown called to . see I her the fol
lowing day and said that, as she had wanted
in the past to go to school, he would now bear
the expense. She refused at first. :to. receive a
cent from him, but -: after Â» much ~ persuasion
filially consented to attend a business college.
â  When : the letters were inaae public I was

But after the trial Dr. Brown's manner
changed. I came nortli to look after IonÂ«
--deferred business interests. At Wattle's re
ouest I sought !>.n interview with Dr. Brown
2nd asked him what he wished Mattie to do,
or where to go, as s,he had neither means nor
friends. He ac ed like a martmau and suid
that he would hold Mattie Overman to her
testimony. If she expected him to support
her, ne said, she was making a serious mistake.
â¢'Why don't you leave her?" he demanded I
replied that I would not do so. I was her only
friend and she was nearly crazy. Then for
the first time my eyes were opened beyond a
doubt to the most selfish, unprincipled man I
had ever known.
Â«â¦â¢â¢â¢â¢
The day before Mrs. Davidson's arrest I came
to San Francisco with Mattie. We went to the
Cosmopolitan Hotel, and there met Dr. and
Mm Brown. Mattie had told Dr. Brown hat
i shared all of her confidences. On the toll
ing Sunday Mattie sent for me to go to >D r.
Brown's house, where she was lying seriously
ill I went there in the morning and re
mained until after dark. When Dr. Brown re
turned from toe evening service he told roe
that the newspaper reporters were 100k in? for
me. All of them wanted me to remain there
until I informed them that I must tell the
truth, and then they wanted me to f?Â»-
When I heard Dr. Brown coaching his wife
what to say in regard to Represents he had
given to Mattie, and when they asked me to
lav nothing of the love between Mattie and
the doctor, I decided that it was best for me to
go. Dr. Brown said that the reporters were
watching the house and were on the front
stops. I would have to wait, be said, un 1
they went, and then I should take a car, sit
ting on the front seat so that no one should
feasted me where I could go and I told him
that I would attend to that part of U. He
asked me if I had any money and I replied
that 1 had some. He asked Mattie it she had
any, but she had none. He was in the same
condition, but Mrs, Brown had $10 and they
gave me that. It was in this way that I left
the home of Dr. Brown on the nignt of Decem
ber 29. Most of my movements from that time
until I returned are well known.- My expenses
were paid by Dr. Brown, for it was to his in
terest to keeD me out of the way.
I met Mattie at National City after she had
testified at the council and at the request oi
Dr. Brown had fled from the City. I returned
to Oakland in the latter part of April. I had
with me a letter from Mattie to Dr. Brown ask
ing him for assistance. I went to the doctor
in her behalf. He said that he would do noth
ing more than to pay her fare to her home and
give her living expenses for a month. I re
plied that it was cruel to throw her off in that
manner to starve. He was going away and he
might easily give her his furniture. She could
hire a house and keep lodgers. He replied
angrily that he intended to take his furniture
with him.
He then asked me to give Mattie up and go
to Central America. But I refused and Mattio
afterward reminded me that ships sometimes
go down in the Pacific. The second council
was about to convene and I went to Stockton,
where no representatives of the newspapers
could find me. Soon after going there 1 re
ceived a telegraphic message from Dr. Brown.
He said he was at Pleasanton and for me to
meet him at the Stockton depot. I met him
there and he demanded that I swear to an af
fidavit that he was a good man.
The affidavit was prepared and I was to swear
to it after returning from Sacramento and be
fore leaving for Central America. I declined to
do so. because I could not swear to a lie. That
was the last I saw of the Rev. Dr. C. O. Brown.
Some time after that Mattie came north to
San Francisco. She tried to see Dr. Brown,
but could not. Phe made several attempts to
have an interview with Deacon Morse and
failed. Morse would uot see her and Dr.
Brown was very quickly on his way to the
East. Mattie has changed her name and in a
new business under new conditions is begin
ning a new life. I think the case of Dr. Brown
now .closed.

Major McKinley Reported as

PROTECTION THE KEYNOTE.
Free Trade Denounced as the Ruin
of the Industrial Interests of
the Country.
When Congressman McCall made his
speech two years ago before the Nation, in
which he objected to a Democratic free
trade crown of thorns being pressed upon
the brow of labor and to the crucifixion of
said labor upon a cross of 14-carat gold, he
little recked that Boy Orator Bryan of
Nebraska would ateal his metaphors and
other figures and use them for the benefit
of Santa Clans Stewart of Nevada and
other wealthy owners of silver mines.
But the real facts of the case are that
Bryan, who had been in the service of tne
Silver MineÂ«owners' Association, stole the
florid periods of McCall and with the aid
of a Dplsarte teacher made the points
effective in a silver speech before the
silver, alias Democratic, convention at
Chicago.
But his speech was stolen and was de
livered in style. Bland, nicknamed -'Sil
ver Dick ," was the logical candidate, but he
was turned down for a funambulistic per
former, a man named Bryan, who, ac
cused of being an anarchist, repudiated
their principles and declared that he was
a Democrat. He also contended that the
People's party was too radical for his
Democratic stomach and that he rejected
it in toto.
Messages of hope and congratulation
continue to pour in to the Republican State
Central Committee in the Palace Hotel.
One of those messages from the Tulare
County Central Committee states that
"McKinlev iÂ« gaining ground here every
day. At first a tremendous Populist wave
struck over this county in favor of Bryan
and free silver, but the tide on second
thought seems to have turned on McKin
ley and protection. We propose to show
that the unlimited free coinage of silver
without international agreement is de
structive of the basic principles of the Re
public. The free-trade Democratic system
has been proved to be damnable."
iTom El Dorado County comes word
that as to the political situation it now
looks as if the Populistic foe was beaten,
The chairman says: "I firmly believe
that McKinlev will carry this county by a
handsome majority."
The chairman of the Santa Barbara
County Committee sayslthat tbe party is
united in a majority, at Jleast, of the full
silver forces in the ranks of the party.
"Bryan means anarchy," he said. "The
Populists are very much disgruntled.
They are even now talking of the replac
ing of Brvan with some one else."
From tf 010 County comes a letter to the
Republican State Central Committee say
ing: "There are but few tickers in this
locality. Ido not know of any time when
I saw the party in better sbape."
The following is a copy ot a circular
sent to tbe Republican Alliance of Oak
land:

The meeting in Oakland to-morrow
evening will be a great one. There is a
long list of eminent speakers, for which
reason it would be well for those who at
tend to go early.
Harry J. Agnew, the well-known horse
man, has just returned from a visit to j
Guatemala, Central America. He went
down there four months ago with a string
of valuable trottins-horses and sold them
to the aristocracy of that place at a good
profit.
When asked to-day aÂ« to how he stood
pn the currency question lie pointed to a I
solid gold horseshoe in his scarf and said
that that was his metalâ gold.
"I'll tell you why," he added. "Guate
mala is a singl Â». standard silver country.
Other countries are gold standard. Mark
the resuit. I paid $1108 30 after my first
sale In silver to the express office
in the city of Guatemala. I received
for that amount of money a draft
on San Jose, Cal., for $500 in gold. The
; next sum 1 sent was $593 in silver, for
: which I received $250 in gold. I next sent
I $8(0 in silver for only $400. That made me
! tired of a money whose value fluctuated
with the mutations of the moon. I will
vote for McKinley and sound money be
cause when I sell a horse I want to receive
a dollar that will be worth a dollar all the
year around ana all over the world.
"Silver being the standard of value in
Guatemala," continued Mr. Aenew,
"everything is dear but human labor.
That is the cheapest commodity in the
whole country, just as it is in California.
The poor have to live on the most in
ferior food, and the standard of civiliza
tion is at the lowest. Thus if a poor man,
who works for 40 or 50 cents a day, wants
j ham and eggs for his breakfast he must
j pay 75 cents per pound for his ham. Just
j think of it ye corn and pork fed phil
osophers of tiie State of Nebraska! Then
ii he wants butter on his bread he must
pay $2 25 a pound for his butter!
"The reason for those high prices is ap
! parent in the fact that the gold standard
j is recognized as the basis of the currency
I in that country.
"The small dealers buy their goods of
the proprietors and pay them gold prices.
j As they receive silver for their goods they
I must pay accordingly. Hence the high
prices for articles of food."
Populists were resting on their arms
yesterday. They learned, after a hard and
fruitless chase, that the Democracy pro
posed to chew the rag for awhile, as one
of the members put it, and that they
would not declare themselves until all
matters in controversy had been satis
factorily arranged. Nothing can be done
until the arrival of J. J. Dwyer from the
East.
LIFE TRUSTS INVALID,
Judge Coffey So Decides in the
Matter of Nathaniel
Cole's Estate.
One Hundred Thousand Dollars Worth
of Property to Be Divided
at Once.
Judge Coffey yesterday rendered a de
cision in the suit of Mrs. Maud A. Day
against the executor? of the will of her
father, Nathaniel W. Cole. Cole was a
wealthy resident of the Mission, who died
in April, 1894. By the terms of his will he
left all his property, worth about $100,000,
in trust for his daughter, Maud A. Day,
wife of Georce T. Day, and his adopted
daughter, Edith Baxter Cole.
Mrs. Day's property was to continue in
trust until the death of her husband, or if
she should die before him the estate was
to be distributed to her children. Miss
Cole's portion of the estate, consisting of
two lots, one on Shotwell and one on Mis
sion Btreet, was to be turned over to her
when she became 21 years of aga. One
thousand dollars was also left to Mrs.
Emma Ransom of East Oakland, who
was to look after the education and sup
port of Miss Cole during her minority.
The executors of the trust looked after
matters so closely that although Miss
Cole's wants were attended to Mrs. Day
received nothing, the balance of the in
come from the estate being applied to the
closing of its accounts. Therefore Mrs.
Day brought suit to have the trust set
aside, to have Edith Baxter Cole declared
not the' legally adopted daughter of the
deceased aud to have Mrs. Ransom's leg
acy declared void. It was provided, how
ever, in the suit that the adopted daughter
should receive the property willed to her
In any event.
The main point relied upon by the peti
tioner in assailing the legality of Edith
Baxter's adoption was extremely novel,
though apparently supported by an early
California case. It was in effect that adop
tion proceedings are not judicial business
and hence in the adoption papers the
words, "In the Superior Court" and "the
honoroble court" and "in open court,"
constituted error. The petitioner urges
that "the Legislature might have re
quired the proceedings to be taken before
a constable, in which case the statute would
have to be strictly complied with, thourh
no one would then think of calling it 'judi
cial busines?.' "
In commenting on tnis phase of the
case, Judge Coffey said; "While it is
trne, according to che Williams case. 102
California, page 77, that the act of adop
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, AUGUST 8, 1896.

tificates to Practice. Of Twelve Aspirants Only Three. Including a Chinaman, Failed.
tion in this State is not a judicial proceed
ing, and the order, therefore, is in no
sense to be considerpd the judgment of a
court, still some judicial virtue inheres in
it, else it were vain to impose a duty up'jn
a Judge of s Superior Court foreigu to his
office and compelling him to make an ex
amination, take evidence and thereafter
and thereupon, 'if satisfied, ' to make an
â¢order' declaring a status." Tne Judge con
cludes that though the proceeding be not
any one of the" kind? of judicial actions
specified in the Civil Code it has certainly
a judicial savor.
Judge Coft'ey in his decision concludes
that the first count of the complaintâ the
main one â must be sustained. He de
clares, as has Judge Slack in the Fair case,
that a life-long trust is invalid, because it
suspends the power of alienation beyond
the period of lives and bein<j. Edith Bax
ter Cole is held to be the legally adopted
daaghter of Nathaniel W. Cole, and Mrs.
| Ransom's legacy is left untouched.
The trust in Miss Cole's case is said to
; be invalid, because it continues until she
J is 21 years of age, whereas the legal ma
jority of women in California is 18 years.
The petition for a distribution of the
estate is granted, and the daughter and
the adopted daughter will share it imme
diately.
ABOUT SUICIDES.
Great Interest in tho Subject . and a
.Lecture by Dr. Jerome - . . -
. . .Anderson.
. The great interest in the subject oi
suicides, its recent unusual prevalence in
this City, and . the questions of whether
man can escape his burdens by self-in
fl ictâ¬d death, and whether suicide is ever
justifiable continues unabated. And now
the ' Theosophists of . the City have taken
advantage of the . trend of local thought,
and the president of the San Francisco
society, Dr. Jerome A. Anderson, ; is ad
vertised for p lecture on the question of
suicide to-morrow evening at Golden Gate
Hall.
Whatever one may think or not think of
the philosophy of theosophy certain it is
that their theories have awakened a great
deal ot interest in the Western world and
demanded the attention of thinking men
ana women. After the regular Sunday
etening lecture there is always a half hour
spent In answering questions propounded
by the audience, ana this programme will
be pursied at the conclusion of Dr. Ander
son's address Sunday evening.

CARL MOON LEE BPJECTED.
A Denizen of the Chine ss Quarter
Falls Down on Theoretical
Dentistry.
The State Board of Dental Examiners
has been in session at the rooms of the
Stomatological Club, corner of Post and
Stockton streets, since Tuesday, endeav
oring to ascertain by searching examina
tions who of tbe even dozen applicants
who presented themselves were competent
to extract molars, do funny things to
jumping nerves and take all sorts of liber
ties with the inteiior of unsuspecting pa
tients' beads.
The board at present is coraposed of five
members. This is three shy of the nor
mal nunrber, one having resigned during
the past year and the terms of two having
expired. The board as at present consti
tuted consists of: Dr. F. F. Tebbetts of
Sacramento, president; Thomas Morffew
of San Francisco, F. W. Bliss, Santa Cruz;
W. A. Moore, Benicia, and J. D. Hodgen,
secretary. San Francisco.
The tests to which candidates are sub
mitted are not simple If the forbidding
titles of the subjects of examination are
any guide. The examinations are divided
into two classes, theoretical and practical.
The theoretical embraces an even dozen
such subjects as hygiene, pathology, ma
teria medica, prosthetic dentistry, his
tology and metallurgy. If the aspirant
masters all these branches he is only half
way to the goal of his ambition. If he
does not attain a respectable percentage in
them his troubles ara all over.
Yesterday the examiners took the stu
dents wlio had proved themselves suffi
ciently proficient in theoretical dentistry
to the rooms of the College of Dentistry.
There they proved their prowess upon the
jaws of suffering victims.
At the end of this test the examiners re
paired to the rooms of the Stomatological
Club, and after deliberation decided that
the following young men were entitled to
certificates: H. H. Roche of San Fran
cisco, F. R. Husted of San Jose, ix. F.
Roberts of San Francisco, M. S. Childs of
Suisun, S. J. Symmons of Oakland, G. W.
Larken of Sacramento, E. Pieper of San
Jo-e, J. Dowling of San Francisco, W. W.
Head of San Francisco.
Among the unsuccessful applicants was
Carl Moon Lee, who has for some time
been wielding his forceps in Chinatown.
Moon Lee was in nowise abashed by the
imposing array of high-priced woqds con
tained in the questions, and he waded in
merrily. Â
It was evident from his answers that
even the most abstruse topics had been
given some attention by him, but it was
also evident that his bold upon the
English language was ramer treacherous.
From works on histology and therapeutics
he had undoubtedly gleaned ideas, but
the ideas he had cleaned Â»ere not tnose
which the authors had sown. As a con
sequence Carl Moon Lee was rejected with
out his having an opportunity to show in
the practical class what new tricks the
heathen Chinee is prepared to contribute
to dental science,
The election of officers which was to
have taken place was deferred on account
of the vacancies in the board.

Dare, tbe speaker of the evening, who in
an eloquent address said among other
things to tbe members of the club, who
are largely composed of working people,
that under Republican administration and
protection the workingrnen marched into
the factories with well-filled dinner pails.
But to-day the dinner-pails are turned up
side down and are empty by reason of the
infamous Gorham-Wilson bill for revenue
only.
"But," said he, "the workingmen will
take their empty dinner cans and turn
them into snare drums and never stop
drumming them until they have drummed
McKiiiley into office." Mr. Dare's re
marks were received with much applause
and enthusiasm. Short speeches were
made by John F. Muhin, Jasper Planz,
Tim Foley, W. B. Hopkins and others.
The club unanimously indorsed John W.
Koch for the nomination for Justice of the
Peace, and adjourned with cheers for Mc-
Kinley and protection.

CLAUS SPRECKELS INDORSED.
The Nomination of George W. Elder
for Superintendent of Streets
. . Is Urged.
A large and enthusiastic gathering of
gentlemen attended last night's meeting
of the Mission Independent Republican
Club of the Thirty-fourth Assembly Dis
trict to hear Congressman Eugene F.
Loud and other well-known orators speak
upon the political issues of the day. C. C.
Butt, president of the club, who occupied
the chair, introduced Mr. Loud, who was
received with many cordial acclamations.
In a speech devoid of all rhetorical flour
ishes, but made up of solid and convincing
arguments, the eloquent statesman clearly
and simply set forth the principles of the
Republican party concerning protection
and the monetary question. Mr. Loud's
way of speaking is singularly convincing
and original.
In last nigbt's address he divided the
Republican platform into little squares, so
to speak, and did not leave one until it
had been fully explained and the argu
ments for and against it carefully
weigned.
Only in his peroration did Mr. Loud call
into play some of tnose persuasive powers
of oratory which he knows so well how to
use. In terms glowingly impassioned in
their fervor he recounted the past ser
vices rendered by the Republican party to
the Nation, and assured his hearers that
that party, truly grand and truly old,
would now and always stand for all the
Republic holds most dear.
George W. Elder, Major Keil, County
Committeemen John Jackson and R.
Schleuter, John H. Harney and others
spoke on the lines suggested by Mr. Loud,
aud on motion ot tbe last-named speaker
the following preamble and resolutions
were unanimously adopted:
Whereas, Our County Commltteemea, John
Jackson and R. Schleuter, have proved them
selves to be energetic workers in the cause of
Republicanism, and particulnrly for its ad
vancement in the Thirty-fourth Assembly Dis
trict, and this club appreciates their efforts in
that behalf, and is desirous of following the
comincndafble example of sister Republican
clubs ; it is hereby
Resolved, That the action of our County Com
mitteemen be and is hereby fully indorsed, and
that this club tender them its hearty and un
qualified support; and be it further
Resolved, That this club recognizes in John
D. Spreckels a worthy loader of the Republican
party; that he is in every respect worthy of
our confidence and support, and that we pledge

OLD SOLDIERS AND SAILORS
Their Organization Now Has the
Name McKinley Pre
fixed.
The annual meeting of tne Veteran
Soldiers and Sailors took place yesterday
at their headquarters. The room was
filled with enthusiastic veterans, as the
members had been notified that a change
of name of the organization by prefixing
that of McKiniey would be acted on, also
that election of officers would take place.
The proposition of changing the name
was carried by a nnanimoas vote and the
veterans were elated thereby.
The election of officers resulted as fol
lows: President, Fergus Hansen; firÃt
vice-president, F, W. Whiteside; second
vice-president, W. B. Maydwell; treasurer,
L. D. Olin ; secretary, E. P. Morey ; cor
responding secretary, L. Washburn; ser
geant-at-arms, John H. Lakin.
The following preamble and resolutions
were unanimously adopted :
Whekeap, The Democratic party under the
administration of its chief executive. Grove;
Cleveland, has in its management and carry
inst out its principles for the past three years
convinced all unbiased citizens that tariff for
revenue only, coupled with free-trade doc
trine, has been a failure, as evident by bank
ruptcy of farmers and merchants, the clos
ing of manufactories, the reduction of the
wages of our mechanics and laborers,
and the increase of our National debt
by over two hundred million* of
dollars; and whereas, under the wise and
judicious administration of the Republican
party, with its principles of tariff and protec
tion to American products and labor, we were
not only able to carry on the Government but
to reduce our immense National debt over 60
per cent, and thereby add to the wealth of the
Nation, thus giving to tbe laborer an honest
dollar and liberal wages and prosperity to all
of our citizens; therefore, be it
That we, ex-Union veteran;soldiers
and sailors.again renew our fealty to the party
of progress and protection; that we indorse
and give our hearty support to the nominee* of
the National Republican Convention of 1896,
and will do all in our power to further the
election of William McKinley and Garret A.
Hobart.

THE FIELD
OD SPORT
After a few weeks lull in matters pugil
istic, a storm has arrived which will keep
the fancy blowing during the remainder
of the month.
Yesterday two important matches were
consummated. Big Joe McAuiiffe, the
Mission giant, was signed to fight Choyn
ski on the evening of the 28th inst., and
Van Buskirk telegraphed the managers
of the Colma Club that he would fight
Jeffries on the evening of September 2.
The wheelmen will have a gala outing
at San Rafael on Sunday.
The intercollegiate football players are
arranging for the selection of teams.
The oarsmen are all in active training
for the Stockton regatta.
The Interstate Coursing Club is exercis
ing its dogs preparatory to the next big
meeting at Ingleside Park.
Deer hunters are scouring the hills in
quest of game, and the anglers are now
enjoying the cream of tne season's sport
in the mountains. All in all this is a very
busy season in all-round sporting.
THE WHEELMEN.
Road Racine at San Rafael and a
Watermelon Run at Stockton
To-Morrow.
There are very few cycling events
scheduled for to-morrow or the near
tuture. Not that interest in the sport is
flagging, but tbis is a poor time of the
year for club runs or road races, as the
country roads are hot and dusty and the
weather is too warm for comfort.
Many of the local clubs will go to Stock- j
ton by boat to-night to attend the water- I
melon run of the Terminal City Wheelmen |
there to-morrow. Another attraction for i
those who like road racing wiii be the two |
events arranged by tne management of i
tbe Hotel Raiatl and open to ail amateur
riders, a two-mile handicap and alive-mile
handicap, for which good prizes have been j
offered. These will oe run off on the road
between San Anselmo and San Katael,
the finish being in iront of the hotel.
Riders can enter the races ou the ground
to-morrow morning, ana the handicapping \
will be attended to then by Robert A. j
Smyth, official handicapper of tne League [
of American Wheelmen.
Three coast cities will make a bid for
the wheelmen on September 9, Admission |
day, Santa Rosa, Sau Jose and Stockton. I
Santa Rosa has not yet made any great
preparations, and may decide not to hold I
a meet until later in the season. The San |
Jose men were up to the last meeting of
the associated clubs and tried to get the
annual parade for their town on that day,
whicn shows that they are already at work
on tbeir meet and entry blanKs and prize
lists may be expected before long.
The Stockton meet will perhaps prove
the greatest drawing card, as the Native
Sons celebrate there on that day, and the
prizes they have offered are so lioerai that
most of the best racing men will attend
that meet. The races will be held under
the auspices of the cycling annex of the
Stockton Athletic Club, which is com
posed largely of members of the old Oak
Leaf Wheelmen, whose cordial entertain
ment of all visiting wheelmen has en
deared them to the meniDers of the
Olympic, Bay City, Reliance and other
clubs who have Irom time to lime made
pilgrimages to that city.
They have secured the half-mile dirt
track at Good water Grove, which has
always been lightning fast, and on this
the races will be run. There will be a
mile scratch and a mile handicap for the
professionals, with four prizes for each
race, $80, $40, $20 and $10, aggregating
$150. There will be two amateur events,
a half-mile scratch and a mile handicap,
with the full limit of prizes allowed by
the league. The cyclists of Stockton wiil
arrange for the reception and entertain
ment of the visiting wheelmen in con
junction with the Native Sons, and all are
assured a merry time who journey to that
point on September 9.
The Stockton Athletic Club is situated
John S. Johnson, the Crack American Racer, Who Has just Returned From
Abroad.
in a large and excellently appointed club
house near the water's edge. The club
has parlors, gymnasium, baths, wheei
room, billiard-room, lockers and all other
conveniences, including a room for the
storing of shells and racing-boats used by
the rowing annex, which is an important
feature of the club. Among the wheel
men in the club one will meet Arthur
Wri?ht, Bob Inglis, Fred Eckstrom,
Hutchinson, McCuen and a dozen others
who were well-known as members of the
Oak Leafs, tozether with considerable
new blood which has been infused into
the ranks of late.
The Stockton Road Club is a new and
strong organization numerically, having
more members than the Terminal Citys or
the cycling annex of the athletic club.
The Terminal City Club is a league club
and in this connection considerable good
work for the league nas been done by Or
rin S. Henderson, the local consul, who,
by the way, is one of the champion swim
mers of Stockton.
The Olympic City Wheelmen are talk
ing of a joint run with the Reliance Club
Wheelmen to Stockton by boat Saturday
evening, August 22. Hearing of this the
wheelmen of the athletic club have de
cided to invite them to be their guests
while there and will also invite the Bay
City Wheelmen to come up at the same |
time. A run to Lodi and a feast upon
watermelons would be features of the re
ception.
Walter B. Fawcett is arranging a big
race meet to be held on the Central Park
track on Saturday afternoon, August 22.
He has the support of all the local cycling
clubs ana the Cycle Board of Trade has
called a special meeting for next Monday
night to consider in what way they can
lend the project their aid. Wheelmen of
this City are alive to the fact that there
should be race meets held in this City and
that they can be made a success if prop
erly handled, and Mr. Fawcett is receiving
a great deal of encouragement in his pre
liminary arrangements. Suitable prizes
will be awarded in the different events
and there will probably be a match race
between two crack professionals from dif
ferent clubs, paced by tandems.
Collisions are sometimes unavoidabte,
no matter how careful a rider may be. Of
course, it is always better to avoid a
smash-up if such a thing is possible.
There a.c casesâ and it happens to nearly
every cyclistâ when a collision cannot be
avoided. Then the old saw, "Self-preser
vation is the first law of nature," comes
in. Put on a little extra steam and strike
your adversary's wheel head on. Don't
allow him to hit you broadside or your
wheel won't be worth much. Above all,
always keep cool and observe the rules of
cbe road. If you do this it will be the
other fellow's fault if there is any trouble.
Wheelmen should avoid all sweetened
drinks when on tour. They only serve to
increase the thirst. The most beneficial
drink is ginger ale. The imported article
is tbe best, and if served in a large glass,
with a fresh egg broKen in it and thor
oughly mixed, the potion ia delicious and
exceedingly refrestiing.
Tom Cooper, who leads the racing men
on Spooner's percentage ladder, is a youth
who is trained to perfection. In fact, it is
said he could never get into finer physical
condition. Old trainers say that unless a
rider shows progress he must go back.
This is apt to happen in Cooper's case.
He is now in that rare form where his con
dition is faultiess. There is a chance of
his breaking down any day. Unless he
pays strict attention to himself the strain
is apt to affect him. Experienced men
say he cannot last the season out at his
present gait. Bald is a larger man and
seems to have more strength and nerve
force, but the circuit last year told on him.
Cooper is a more conservative young man
than Bald, however; saves his money and
does not run around "with the boys'; as
a result he is not as popular among the
circuit followers as is Bald.
The cyclists of this country are looking
toward Louisville, where the annual race
meet of the League of American Wheel
men will begin on August 10 and continue
five days. Everybody liad a royal time at
Asbury Park last year, but those who go
to the Blue GraÂ»s State will, in all proba
bility, not be sorry that they made tbe

journey. The Kentuckians are a hos
pitable people and the visitors will be
well looked after. Tbe racing features
promise to be tbe very best ever given at a
National meet. A large crowd of enthu
siasts will go down from New York and
the East, and arrangements are being
made to run special trains by more than
one of the roads. Visitors to the meet
should not leave Kentucky without first
visiting Mammoth Cave, one of the won
ders of the country. Excursions will be
run from Louisville to the cave at reduced
rates for L. A. W. members.
Never lend your bicycle to anybody.
Better by far to go down into your pocket
anu hand over to your friend the price to
hire a wheel. It is a difficult matter to get
a wheel adjusted to a person and when
you once get it fixed to suit you it is better
to keep it that way. If you Joan it the
borrower is sure to change something.
Those who purchase a new bicycle every
year will readily agree with the above.

On Sunday, August 16, the Olympic
Club Wheelmen will hold a five-mile road
race, for which there will be a large field
of entrants and numerous valuable prizes.
On the following Saturday night they will
go by boat to Stockton and have a run to
Lodi the following day.
French manufacturers are apprehensive
over the anticipated invasion of American
I bicyoles, and from the feverish haste with
which the Chamber of Deputies bas been
asked for protection, it is inferred that the
foreign makers fear a comparison of their
wheels with those of this country. This
season has seen exports of thousands of
American wheels for foreign ports, but
they are nothing to the number that will
follow next year. There is a craze spread
ing for American bicycles that has taken
tbe form of a stampede.
The members of the San Francisco Road
Club will go to Stockton to-night qn the 6

attend tne watermelon run there to-mor

the club, will ride in the transcontinental
relay race on the 24th on tbe stretch from
San Leandro to Hay wards, and will try to
lower the worlds five mile record held by
himself at that time. Hamlin is also
going to try for the world's ten- mile
record before long.

THE ANGLER.
Where Sportsmen Can Enjoy Good
Fishing-â Stocking Streams.
Although the season for the capture of
trout by lawful means will not expire
until the Ist of November, local anglers
are in a quandary as to how they can
spend their off days from business in the
enjoyment of a pastime which they love
best.
They say it is only an expenditure of
time and money to visit any of the coast
streams, as none of them contain trout of
a size worthy of a place in a creel â thanks
to the very "excellent" system of stocking
creeks as now employed by the Fish Com
missioners.
There are, however, a few streams in
Sonoma and Mendocino counties which
will pan out well to an experienced angler
who will credit trout with having suf
ficient power of vision to see a large object
when it gets immediately opposite a pool,
the water of which is now as clear as
crystal.
Trout are very cunning in summer and
to catch them the angler mast be accurate
in casting and use only the very finest and
best quality of tackle. The greatest secret
of success, however, is in keeping your
presence bidden from the quick eye of the
wary denizens, and to accomplish this
trick long-distance casts are frequently
necessary.
Pieta Creek was in past years a favorite
resort of anglers, but this year the trout
averaged only four inches in length, and
from all accounts rattlesnakes are numer
ous along the creek bottom.
The headwaters of the Big Sulphur
Creek, a beautiful stream which empties
into the Russian River near Cloyerdale,
will be found well worthy of a visit. The
fish are all of good size and occasionally a
whopper weighing a pound will test the
quality of your tackle. Latest reports
state that first-class hsbing can be had
near boonville, which place is reached by
team from Cloverdale. North of Ukiah
are several good streams, but the most
productive are the head waters of the Eel
river.
Anglers who can afford the time and
the expense of travel should repair to the
streams of the Sierra Nevadas, which are
now in excellent order for fly fishing. The
famous Truckee River is daily growing
better and within a few hours' ride of
Boca there are several shaded mountain
creeks that contain rainbow, cutthroat
and New Hampshire trout. The flies that
have been giving the best results of late
are: Brown hackle, red tail, gray hackle,
Benns' royal coachman, cadis No. 2, red
ant, black gnat, March brown, Katie May,
Murdock's professor No. 1 and Eraeric's
professor No. 2, hare's ear in yellow,
grizzly king, McÃae's San Andreas mos
quito and Sicinner's neverfail.
Al Cumming, the champion fly-caster
of Fruitvale, is authority for the state
ment that he is having a fly made which
will put all flies in the shade so far as
Truckee River fishing is concerned. It
will be known as the Royal Highlander.
Captain George Cumming is perfecting
arrangements for a party of local sports
men who are contemplating a trip to the
famous Williamson River in Southern
Oregon. The captain is now 70-odd years
of age, and a more enthusiastic angler
does not live on this side of the Rocky
Monntains. It will be many years yet be
fore the captain's line will run out, as he
is as hale and hearty as a young colt.
Walter Mansfield, the president of the
Fly-Casting Club, left last evening with
his fisbing mate, W. Bogard, for a whip at
the Truckee and small streams in the vi
cinity of boca. As "there are others" who
will iourney East in the very near future,
it is hoped that the experts in fly-casting
will leave a few silver-sides lor the ones
who are now enjoying only feasts of an
ticipation.
It is said that the Federal Fish Commis
sion is interested in Crater Lake, in Ore
gon, and men have been sent there to as
certain if it is supplied with enough nat
ural food to warrant its being stocked with
fish. Like Trapper's Lake, in Colorado,
this lake is very deep; in fact, it is said to
be the deepest freah water lake in the
West, although less than five miles in
width.
Professor Hervey recently returned from
an outing on the River Sur, in Monterey
County. He says the trout are large and
numerous, but that they will not take a
fly ; bait must be used.
George Walker, Joseph Kelly and Wil
liam Cooper have been whipping the
Truckee since Saturday last. As nothing
has been beard from them the supposition
is that they have not enjoyed very good
sport.
Miller, the jeweler, caught a half-pound
trout in tie Lagunitas Creek recently
which was afflicted with parasites.
H. C. Golcher has been credited with
having made a iong-distar.ee cast of
ninety-two feet recently o4i Stow Lake. A
morning paper stated that it came within
three feet of equaling the amateur record
for the United States. An Eastern paper
devoted to field sports replies as follows:
We beg leave to correct the sporting editor
of the Chronicle. On August 17, 1895, during
the medal contests ct the Chicago Fly-Casting
Club at North Garrield Park in that city, B. \V.
Goodsell, a member oi tbe club and an ama
teur, made a clean cast of 101 feet, or only
eighteen inches short of R. C.Leonard's pro
fessional single-handed world's record, made
at Central Park. New York, several years be
fore. What makes Mr. Goodsell's feat more re
markable is as follows: In the single-handed
long distance fly-casting club medal contest
he was using an B^-ounce. lO'.Â£ foot rod, a
9-foot leader, with a single fly; and his cast,
101 feet, never has been equalled or closely
approachedâ so far as we knowâ with the
same implements at any casting eveui in the
world. ,
There will be some practice casting this
afternoon on Stow Lake, and on the even
ing of the 11th inst. a meeting of the Fly-
Casting Club will be held in Flood build
ing, which will be addressed by Professor
Hibbard.
At a recent meeting of the Fish Commis
sion the application of the Visalia Sports
man's Club* for 25,000 cut- throat trout was
granted. The fish will be shipped in the
near future and distributed by members
of the club.
The following anglers recently returned
from Webber Lake: Charles Huse, Judges
Hunt, tfinn and Slack of tbis City, Judge
Smith of Stockton, T. E. Beans and Ralph
Low of San Jose, Alexander Vogelsang,
B. Townsend, Sam Neustadter, M. Huff,
Frank Dutton, A. Cumming, J. Wheland
and H. Emeric.
The Fish Commissioners have placed
large-mouth bass in what is known as the
"lake in the woods," a body of water
within half an hour's tramp of Webber
Lake. The bass will destroy the trout
fishing if there are any trout in the lake
in question.
Several thousand Loch Leven and
Brown trout fry have been placed in
Webber Lake, and the little Loch
Levenites are now .jumping at flies as if
their lives depended upon the number
they catch. They are very well pleased
with their new home evidently, and in a
few years hence anglers will enjoy royal
sport, as the Loch Levin trout is the
gamest of the family.
Local anglers are in hopes that the
fepring Valley Water Company will rein
state James* Kerr, the keeper of San
Andreas Lake, who was discharged a few
clays ago. Kerr was very popular with
the angling fraternity.
GUN AND RIFLE.
Localities Where Good Deer-
Shooting Can Be Enjoyed.
The Olympic and Empire Gun clubs
will meet at the traps at Alanieda Point
to-morrow and some lively cracking of
clays will certainly result. Sportsmen
who are not members of either of tho
above-named clubs are invited to attend a

on tne Empire grounds to-morrow alter
noon, commencing at 1 o'clock.
On October 4 and 5 the California Inan
imate Target Association will meet in

this City on the Tiburon boat bound for

being a favorite resort of sportsmen. It
is distant about twenty-two miles north
west of Cloverdale. The gentlemen who
composed the party are Jim Shaw, Ben
Kerridge of Los Guillicos. Dave Hear
tield, John J. O'Farrell, Dr. Auie, Mr.
Livingston, Charles Fair and Colonel P.
Boland. They were well supplied with
ammunition for tne destruction of bear,
deer and rattlesnakes, and it goes without
saying that during their sojourn in the
country game of all kinds "in season" will
suffer.
A particularly interesting and well
compiled handbook relating to the game
of thia State has just been issued. It is
entitled "California Game Marked Down,"
and is profusely illustrated with halftone
sketches. The author, Dr. William B.
May, has evidently made a most careful
study of his subject, for he treats every
department in a succinct but entertaining
style.
All the most lisely resorts of fish and
fowl, from the Sierras to the soutbern
line, are briefly described, and the best
methods of bagging everything from a
California lion to a chipmunk are clearly
set forth. In addition to this is some val
uable information relating to the manner
of reaching the various happy hunting
grounds and the accommodations for tour
ists which each possesses.
A chapter of unusual interest is devoted
to a contrast between Atlantic and Pacific
coast fields of sport.

-If ; the "sportsmen' b clubs of this City
had as keen an interest in the protection
of game and fish ;as their confreres of the
Northwest there would be less complaints
of poaching and game destruction. At a
meeting of': the Tacoma . Rifle, Rod and
Gun Club recently it was decided to offer
i a reward of $25 for information that would
convict any one in that section of violating
the game laws. The club also secured the
services of three detectives, who will scour
the country in search ; of game-law viola
tors. Tho law-abiding sportsmen of Ta
coma are determined that others shall
respect the laws whether they wish to or
not or pay handsomely for violating them.

was fined $150 and costs, 1 should serve as a

formidable weapon loaded with slugs Major
Juilliard sallied forth the morning after his

THE OARSMEN.
A Row In the Alameda Clubâ All
Ready for Stockton's Regatta.
The Alameda Boating and Swimming
Club has five crackerjack oarsmen train
ing for the senior outrigger skiff race of
the Stockton regatta. A tryout race will
soon be held, and the winners of first and
second places will row under the club's
colors at Stockton.
The men in training-are Jack Lancaster,
captain of the yacht Edna; A. Webb, Fred
Ayers, Samuel J. Pembroke, champion
outrigger skiff oarsman of the coast, and
Dr. Cecil Dennis.
The club has also several men in train
ing for the junior outrigger skiff race, but
it is thought that Victor Hadcock, who
rowed second in this event at StocKton on
last Fourth of July, will be the club's se
lection. For the four-oared barge race the
following crew will be entered : Jack Lan
caster, stroke; A. Webb, afterwaist; Fred
Ayers, forwardwaist, and Victor Had
coclc, bow and captain.
The oarsmen will use the Stockton Ath
letic Association's barge Jim Budd to row
the race in, as the Alameda club has no
racing boats.
The greatest number of entries in the
regatta will come from the South End
Club of this City. It will have an entry
in every event on the programme. Two
new skiffs are now being built for the
club by Twigg & Sons.
It was confidently expected that the
Dolphins and Ariels would drop in line
with the South Ends and make an entry
in every race, as these clubs, unlike some
of the other clubs, have plenty of boats;
but it now looks as if they have already
got "cold feet," for the only entry from
the Dolphin Club will be W. O. Patch in
the junior outrigger skiff race.
The Ariels held a meeting last Monday
night and tried hard to get some barge
crews together, but their efforts were fa
tile. They will be strongly represented in
the single'scull and outrigger events, how
ever, and the club still has hopes of organ
izing a junior and intermediate four-oared
crew to row at Stockton.
William McCausland will be their repre
sentative in the senior single scull, N. J.
Prendergast will row in the junior single
scull race, and Jim Wilson, George Phelan
and Bob Ellis will have a try-out to see
who rows in the senior outrigger event.
J. R. Bockmann, Andy Carroll, N. J.
Prenderga3t and A. Raconleigh will also
have a try-out to settle the question of su
premacy in the junior outrigger event for
the Stockton regatta.
The Pioneers are going to make them
selves known at Stockton on September 9,
and will be in the field with two strong
crews and two crack skiff rowers. If the
junior crew win their race they will enter
for the intermediate contest.
The personnel of the two crews is as fol
lows: Junior â J. Hnnley, stroke; F.
Torths, afterwaist; Tom Faulkner, for
wardwaist; W. St. John, bow, and George
Fitzsimmons, coxswain.
Senior erew â John Clifford, stroke;
j George Collopy, afterwaist ; Coney Ochs,
, forwardwaist; Fred Orr, bow, and George
j Fitzsimmons, coxswain. Both crews are
i in active training.
John Clifford, who won the Whitehall
} championship of Baltimore harbor two
| years ago, will be the Pioneers' representa
tive in the senior outrigger event, and
Fred Orr is the most likely candidate for
the junior skiff race.
At the last regular meeting of the Pio
neers the following new members were
enrolled on the club's roster: J. Madden
Phil Torths, Tom Faulkner and J. RoedÂ«Â»r
The club's barge, John T. McDonald,
which was nearly wrecked while coming
from Goat Island a short time ago has
been entirely refitted. Sliding roller seats
and the latest patent oarlocks have been
put in, and the boat is now thought to be
as fast as any of the new racing craft.
A change has been made in the per
sonnel of the South End junior crew.
Hugh Mrlsaacs, the stroke of the 8U
Mary s College crew that rowed second to
the victorious Olympic Club crew in the
championship regatta of last year, bos
taken J. easterly's place and will row
stroke oar.
The South End senior crew will com
mence training immediately upon the ar
rival of Gus Carson, the afterwaist man,
from his trip up the river.
The Olympic Club crew, the same one
that rowed in third place at the recent El
Campo regatta, has commenced training
from the South End boatbouse.
The members of the Alameda Boating
Club held a rather stormy meeting at
their boathouse at the foot of Chestnut
street, Alameda, last evening, to settle
the controversy between S. J. Pembroke
and J. Sansom," president of the club, over
a seat in the P. A. A. as the club delegate.
Three delegates from the P. A. A., J.
Rothkopf of the Dolphins, J. Rheinharc
of the University Boat Club and William
Espy of the Pioneer Club, were to be on
hand to try and settle the difficulty, but
only one, William Espy, showed up. At
the next meeting of the P. A. A. he wiil
report the elected candidate to the asso
ciation.
Discussions at the meeting were warm
and at times a free fight seemed inevita
ble. Pembroke thought tbat he was be
ing insulted by the officers of the club for
disqualifying him as a clab delegate after
he nad been elected by a vote of 22 to sat
the last meeting of the association. But
there were members present who thought
that as he had missed two meetings â a
club meeting and an association meeting
â he didn't properly represent the club,
and as a consequence they elected Bansom
in his stead.
Pembroke claimed to have received no
official notice of these meetings and or
dered another election, which was held
the other evening by secret ballot, with a
vote standing 9to 9. The vice-president
then decided in favor of Sansom as tha
club delegate, but Pembroke has no in
tention of giving up his seat until the
P. A. A. investigates the whole affair.

FOB THE TRADE A SPECIALTY.
YOSEMITE CYCLE WORKS,
â 112 Golden Gate Aye., S. F.Department moved in the right direction
when it inauguarated a scheme whicH
will be productive of mucn good mentally
and physically to tbe soldiers. The fol
lowing lett*r from a representative of the
army is self-explanatory :
After centuries of investigation it has been
found that something more than mental cram
ming Is necessary for the body politic. All the j
rolleges of any note in the world, and I
especially in America, have adopted various 1
iorms of physical training for the devtlop
raent of young men and women, so that their
movements mignt be easy and graceful; and
:o remove as far as possible the slovenly
methods and awkward gaits one sees among
â¢he peopie of our time. Men of middle age ad
mit that their daughters are better equipped
mentally and physically than their fathers
were; and our style of "New Woman" would
hÂ«ive amazed the men of the last generation.
The War Department, ever watchful for any
thing useful that may appear on the scientific
r.orizon, discovered that physical develop
ment was practical and beneficial elsewhere,
and, after mature consideration, adopted it in
Â»he service. It has been proved that men of
high mental attainments with undeveloped
physical powers were not the beat on a pitched
tield of battle or anywhere else in the hour of
trial.
The officers are doing their level best to
make field day. which is the Second Friday in
every month, interesting for the public as well
a*? for tne men engaged in the various contests.
The respectable part of the community may !
have a limited number of passes issued them |
â¢ ree at department headquarters, Mills build- j
lag, via Government sieamer General McDow- i
eh to Angel isiand and return, and a good |
day's sport Is assured.
The First United States Infantry from Angel
Island and other posts will assemble at Santa
Cruz on the 24th of September for summer
camD. Garfield Park has been secured for the â¢
occasion and the racetrack for the h\eld day !
sports, which will occur oftener than usual. !
A new feature in this year's encampment is j
the bicycle corps oi 150 men, who in conjunc
tion with cavalry wi.l try to force the moan- I
t&in passes around Santa Cruz held by an j
enemy. AU the wneelmen in this part of the
ttate should see this movement, as it ia the
first experiment of the kind ever tried.

CRICKET CHIRPS.
From the East and Northâ The
American Team Abroad.
The Haverford eleven met an eleven of
the Cambridge (England) University on
ths last day of July. It was anything but
a representative Cambridge team, how
ever, for it did not include any member of
the Varsity eleven proper. The result of
the first day was aii in favor oi the Ameri
cans. Cambridge was oui for 202 runs
and Haverford had 197 for three wickets.
The Australians on the same day met
31. C. C. and Ground at Lords. The visit
ors put up 202 runs and the Englishmen
367. Captain Wynyard of Eamtshire

eleven, the Multnomahs, met their first

play a return game against the Associated
Banks.

These rates will remain in force until
superceded by a later tariff, which will
take in additional poinf.and ace subject to
changes in traffic arrangements with
water carriers between San Francisco and
Stockton. Under the present arrangement,
which is expected to continue until the
Valley Road enters San Francisco over its
own tracks and ferries, the water haul will
be performed by the California Navigation
and Improvement Company witn its large
and well-equipped fleet. No single ship
ment will be taken for less than 25 cents.
Kates to and from San Francisco are
based on those to and from Stockton and
can be ascertained by adding to the StocK
ton rates 6 cents per 100 pounds on first
class freight, 3 cents on second class, 2
cents on third and fourth class, 3 cents on
firth class and 60 cents per ton on classes
A, B, C, D and E.
A comprehensive idea of the general
reduction effected by the Valley Road rates
on the existing ones of the Southern Pa
cific is gained by making a comparison of
the charges of tbe two railroads between
Stockton and Merced on tne different
classes of freight. Here is the table:

Shippers in the territory tributary to
be portion of the Valley road thus
opened for general freight basinets will
by reason of the new rates enjoy reduc
tions ranging from 25 to 37% Per cent on
the existing rates of the Southern Pacific
Company.
All articles embraced in the six classes
for which only carload rates are quoted
will take fourth-class rates when shipped
in less than carload lots.
The differentials adopted by the Valley
road between San Francisco and Stockton
are those iv affect on the Southern Pacific
lines, and are considerably less than tne
regular rates charged by the steamers be
tweeu San Francisco and Stockton.
All freight business originating in this
City will be in charge ot C. D. Clark of the
California Navigation and Improvement
Company, whose office is at the foot of
Jackson street.
There arc now some stations at which
the Valley road Has no agents, and in con
sequence freights will have to be prepaid
to and from those points, but a* business
at these points grow they will be supplied
with agents.
Traffic Manager Moss' recent trip over
the road was taken for the purpose of ar
ranging all the detail" necessary to the
prompt and proper handling of all the
business that may be offered. The com
pany has now at its command ample roil
ing stock and motive power. Ie can bring
into immediate service 300 cars and ten
large and powerful locomotives of the
moat approved modern make.
Arrangements have also been made for
I close connections with the boats of the
California NaviarÂ»tion and Improvement
Company at Stockton. All freight wili be
handled at Stockton through the sheds of
the road's water ally, pending the comple
tion of tbe commodious shed of the rail
road company at that point
Class rates have been placed so low in
! these schedules that it is expected that
few, if any, special or so-called commodity
rates will be found necessary.
As soon as thÂ« traffic officials of the South
ern Pacific Company are notified of the
rates put in by the rival of their company
they declarethey will meet them. They
state further that no attempt will be made
to cut under the tariff of the new road.
This mean 3 that every shipper, not only
within the area tributary to tne Valley
road, but also those within the territory
tributary to the lines of the Southern Pa
cific Company, with wbich the Valley road
is in competition, will reap tne beneht of
ttie low rates.
Aside from the direct advantage to the
people who are located within this fa
vored area there is a deep significance to
the prospective reductions of the Southern
Pacific Company in this sectionâ one of its
richest and most lucrative fields. Here it
is about to make sweeping reductions, on
every class of freight, which wi.'l range
from 25 to 3734 per cent, when its officials,
under oath in tlie United States Circuit
Conrt, testified that a reduction of 8 per
cent on grain rates alone would mean loss
to tbe company and a practical confisca
tion of ita property.
FED TAINTED FOOD.
A Health Officer's Unsavory. *lnd la a
PoiÂ»t Lobos Avenue Grading ;
Camp.
Inspector Patten of the Board of Health
discovered a sad state of affairs in ths
commisary department of E. T. Dennison's
grading camp at Point Lobos and Ninth
avenues yesterday, and reported the mat
ter at the Health Office.
Patten cabled at the camp in the course
of his daily rounds and asked to be shown
the meat and butter fed the men. Out of
tbe meat ne picked a large piece that ap
peared to be tainted and also found some
butter that was rapidly becoming rancid.
Market Inspector Davis pronounced tlie
food to be unfit for use and will make an
investigation to-day.
SHE DISROBED IN COURT
Mrs. Al King Was Determined

and his wife against P. P. Kennedy & Co.
in Justice Carroll's court yesterday, were
treated to a most novel experience in be
| ing driven out of the conrt to give the
principal witness for the plaintiffs â Mrs.
King herselfâ a chance to change her
i dress, which she did in the courtroom.
The Jeeal trouble between the houses of
King and Kennedy arose over a dress-pat
tern which the complainant in the case
says was worth fU. Mrs. King, according
j to tne testimony, took the goods to Ken
! nedy & Co. to be made up into a costume.
| She claims that when tbe dress was re
i turned to her as finished, sne found that
it did not fit, and that by reason of having
been cut the goods were ruined. She de
manded new goods or the value, but
neither was obtainable and suit was begun.
Tbe attorneys did not appear to be able
I to definitely settle whether the work was
j well done or not. Some witnesses said
tbe gown fitted, others that it did not, and
a cloud of uncertainty hung over this im
portant point until Mrs. King agreed to
settle all ; doubts by exhibiting the dress
on her own person. f" c ; , ::r"
She looked about for a place to change,
but none wat visible, and a*. wave of em
barrassment began to rise about the court
room. Just when the 1 matter was becom
ing | uncomfortable Justice â - Carroll's ~ face
lighted op, â  and *he J ordered j the room
cleared. He was tbe last to leave, ana
said as he closed (be door: ;.j- " . s :
"Madam, you will be as free from in
trusion as you would In your own home.-'
Mrs. Kin* was nothing if not same, and
when the Justice knocked timidly at the
door a few moments i; later and 'asked
whether she | was \ ready she answered in
the | affirmative," and s on | the | crowd filing
back into the 1 room }it was * seen I that she
had made a complete a change and was
wearing*the alleged ill-fitting dress. V
Whether or not the court thought the
dress was a failure will be told on Mon
day next, when the decision is rendered. '

NO DRAWBACKS ALLOWED
Judge Mcrrow Overrules the
Demurrer of Importer
Wheeler.
Imported Corks and Bottles Not Sub
ject to the Drawback Named
in the McKinley Act
Judge Morrow yesterday rendered a de
cision in favor of the Government in the
action brought by Robert S. Wheeler to â¢
recover certain drawbacks on imported
corks and bottles alleged to be due under :
the McKinley act.
"The matter under consideration," said i
Judge Morrow, "is the suit to recover j
$180 33 under section 25 of the revenue act i
of October 1, 1890, known as the McKinley j
act, claimed to be due plaintiff as a draw- |
back on imported materials, namely corks !
and bottles, on which duty had been paid, '
which materials it was alleged had been
used in the manufacture or production of i
articles manufactured or produced in the
United States, to wit, in the manufacture
of bottled beer, afterward exported to
foreign countries. The corks and bottles
on which the drawback was claimed did
not, however, enter into the manufacture,
strictly speaking, of tha beer, but were
simply the coverings on packages for it."
The' Government demurred to the alle
gations of the plaintiff on the grounds
that the act under which the drawback
was claimed specified that goods mast be
exported within three years, and further
the drawback was only to be allowed on
goods produced wholly or in part in tbe
United States, including such articles as
rice, hops and barley.
The Government contended that corks
and bottles were not produced in tnis
country, and consequently not subject to
the drawback as defined in the McKinley
act of 1890. Judt;e Morrow yesterday sus
tained the position assumed by the Dis
trict Attorney, which practically ends the
litigation.
A Peculiar Will.
The will of Julius Tammeyer has been filed
for probate. He leaves all his property to his
son. George Tammeyer, and appoints Frederick
Wigginton, Jacob Weiss and F. W. Goetze as
exeeutof3.
Tammayer provided in his testament that
his obsequies be conducted under the auspices
of the Turn Verein and that his body be cre
mated at Cypress Lawn Cemetery. He also re
quested that Emil Liesz, a "free-thinker"
speaker, say a few words in his behalf at the
funeral.
Not Sentenced.
, Becker and Creegan, the Nevada Bank
swindlers, were yesterday up for sentence be
fore Judge Wallace. Peter F. Dunne, attorney
for the convicted men, tiled a bill of excep
tions, which District Attorney Black asked for
two weeks' time to examine. It was granted,
and tiie motion for a new trial will then
come up.

Dear Sirâ l want you ;to let people know
what your Belt nas . done for ; me. When ;â  I 1
! bought it last December I was troubled with a |
! continual pain in the back and sometimes . ex- j
tending up to the shoulder blades; 1 I had been 1
troubled for years and had tried everything in !
the line 01 aoetors â¢ and; advertistd; remedies j
without relief. I was : also very .; constipated
ana ha i to take laxaiives every day. I finally
made up my mind to try one of your Belts and
I am glad I did so. "1 In about three weeks after
putting the Belt t n ail the pain had gone, and
1 I have felt none since. ; My back is now strong
and will stand all the strain â  1 can put oa it
I without hurting. My bowe s are a* regular as
clockwork, and I nave gained ten pounds in
j weight. L shall always speak well oi your
Beit, for it has done for me what nothing else
! could do. I think it is the best thing ever
' vented for the cure of weakness and disease. >

Financial. â 
NEW. YORK, :N. V., Aug. 7.â The . bears had
a field day at the Stock Exchange,* liquidations
having been on a heavy scale in the last hour of
' business, when a steadier tone prevailed, the latter
a result of covering of short contracts. The early
loss in prices was eq>:al to I@7i4 per cent in the
usually active list and 2Â®1 3 per cent in the spe
cialties, or slocks which are not traded in daily.
The depression in the market was due principally
to ihe higher rates lor money demanded by bank
ers generally, whicn has compelled weak holders
to market : their securities. To-day â  call money,
which has not risen above 3 per cent for months,
suddenly advanced to 7 per cent and' closed near
the top figure. , , ;;: -
Dealings in time money were on a very moderate
scale and, In fact, lenders were not . disposed to do
business in tills department at all. To add to the
nervousness a story was started to the effect that
the banks intended to Issue clearing-bouse certifi
cates. â  There was nothing in this report, but it bad
its effect. It is true thai there i has been consider
able calling of loans by the banks, but, that al
ways happens when the values at the S:ock Ex
change melt away as they did to-day. The West
was a seller for the account of operators who have
sustained serious losses through ' the collapse of
the Diamond Match deal. â¢. -, â¢ ; -Â«â 
- Another depressing factor was the alleged state-
I ment by ex-secretary of the Navy Whitney that
Bryan would carry New York. .: This alarmed any
number of small operators and resulted in the sell
ing of qui:e a large amount of long stock. â¢ New
low records were made in a number of | instances,
and some stocks so:d , below the figures current in

A special meeting of the . Edison Light and
Power ; Company Is called for â¢ September * 14, to "
take action on the proposr lon , to decrease the cap
ital from $3,000,000 to 8800:000. There are only .
20,000 shares out, each of a, par value of $100,'
which m kes the paid-up capital $2,000,000. It Is
presumed the reduction Is preliminary to the pro
posed consolidation with the San Francisco Gas
light Company, when the stockholders are under
stood to get one and one-third shares of new stock
for every ' surrendered ' share â of ' Edison ' Light 1
stock.".- ' i: â¢-â¢â¢â¢'-Â«â ...â  r~^^

the 400 level point, and a station will then be ex
cavated.' ' Then a south drift will â¢be started and
run 'to . the Chollar-Norcross I line, some 50 1 feet

J. C. Simonds Figured in
Several Romances in
Oakland.

Had Nothing to Build

Oaklasd Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Aug. 7. f
In the matter of amours Judge James
Cameron Simonds, who left a will giving
James Cameron Simonds, Who Came to Oakland to Bnild Railroads. He de
veloped a Weakness for Widows, but His Love Was Spurned and He
Died in a New York Madhouse.
an estate to a typewriter in San Francisco, |
was like Senator Fair. He loved widows, j
tut unlike the Senator his only estate i
consists of promissory notes long since
overdue and a few unpaid loans.
Half of Alameda County is interested in J
J. C. Simonds, railroad promoter, lawyer j
and ardent lover. Two widows and one j
very estimable young iady were ap
proached by the man of imaginary
wealth and some of his love affairs were
considered as still pending when news of
his death and of his will and of his for
tune were received. He was known in
bank and commercial circles and was not
a stranger in some sections of society, and |
his name was on every tongue to-day.
About a year ago Judge Simonds came I
to Oakland and tried to interest prominent !
people in some railroad enterprises that
he was anxious to promote. Some special
meetings of the Board of Trade were held,
and Judge Simonds appeared and outlined
his plans. He brought with him some
contracts from railroad builders, and the
terms seemed altogether too easy. The |
plans were submitted to the banks and i
some inquiry was made, but the bonuses |
and subscriptions asked by Simonds were
not readily granted.
Correspondence was opened with Chi
cago, and after that the schemes were
looked on with less favor than ever. His
purpose was to promote the construction
of a railroad from Oakland eastward to
connect with some overland trunk line.
His plan was first to connect with the
Santa Fe, but when he found the Valley
road would preoccupy that route he con
ceived a plan for a line up the Sacramento
Valley from this point to join the Union
or Northern Pacific.
However, his plans were either imprac
ticable or too exacting to meet with favor.
President Keller of the Board of Trade
was particularly active in assisting the de
ceased in presenting his promoting enter
prises until he found his efforts were sim
ply a waste of time.
After being disappointed in Oakland
Judge Simonds moved to San Francisco,
but was no more successful. A few months
ago he reopened communications with this
city, and on his last trip here be presented
some new ideas, and it was thought he i
was still trying to build a railroad on the
the coast when news of his death was re
ceived.
Simonda introduced himself to M. J.
Keller on his arrival in Oakland. He at
once laid his plans before the merchant j
and askdd for his influence in interesting
capital to construct a competing railroad
in California. Mr. Keller dispatched let
ters East asking information of the man
and hiÂ« backing. Simonds did not claim
to have any capital, but was simply work
ing to invest others' capital.
He was often short of funds, and asked
a small loan of various friends until he
could get a remittance. In this way he
became indebted to almost every man
with whom he became acquainted. When
asked about the matter to-day Mr. Keller
said :
"Simonds was a peculiar man. He
would borrow money of every one. He al
ways went to the theater and usually took
some lady with him. Mrs. S. S. Austin j
of Twenty -third avenue wÂ»s a great
favorite with him for a time. He would
telephone for her to Â«o to the City or the
Macdonough Theater several times a week.
Then he took up with a Miss Shaw, a
school ieacher as old as himself. We did
not receive very favorable reports from
the East when we asked about him so I
declined to have any more to do with his
schemes.
"I understand that this man Poole, who
is designated as an executor, was quite a
loser by Simonds' borrowing propensities.
It is also said that the president of the
Board of Trade of San J03% lost heavily by
assisting the projects put forth by him.
He often borrowed from the boys in the
store, but only in small amounts. Most
of it was repaid before he left."
The Mrs. Austin with whom Simonds
became so intimate was formerly the wife
of S. S. Austin, a real estate dealer. About
a year ago she met her husband on Broad
way with another woman. She was look
ing for him and had a cowhide whip with
her. She decended upon the couple with
all the fury a woman can command upon
such an occasion, and whipped the pair as
long as her strength lasted and she could
keep up with them. This resulted in a
divorce suit and a separation.
Mrs. Austin is said to have received
Simonds' attentions graciously, and recip
rocated them. She was often seen at the
theaters with him, and they always took
dinner at one of the downtown restaurants
afterward. Her library was increased by
numerous volumes of nis donation, and it
was given out by Siraonds that they were
to be married.
Simonds was also a familiar figure in
San Leandro, where he had another ro
mance. He met a charming young lady,
a daughter of Daniel Best, the agricul
tural implement maker, and pressed his
suit with fervor. He called often and
stayed late when he went out to the
suburb. His gifts of books, pictures and
photographs were numerous. The young
lady belonged to one of the most promi
nent families of the town. She appre
ciated his talents and enjoyed his descrip
tions of foreign countries, but finally,
when he proposed, he was rejected.
George Fl int. who was then connected
with the Central Bank, and who was a
friend of the Best family, heard of the
matter, and he commenced to inquire into
Simonds' antecedents.
He found that he was making profes
sions of love to others at the same time.
Mr. Flint sent a gentle note to Mr. Si
monds admonishing him to leave the
young lady alone. Later he followed this
with a request for Miss Best's photo
graph. It was not forthcoming, but Flint
persisted. He delivered to Simonds all of
his pictures and trinkets given the girl,
with a formal demand for hers, or he
would proceed by law to recover the same.
This had the desired effect and the pic
tures were returned.
For several days, at one time, Simonds
stayed in San Leandro with a blackened
eye, said to have been given him by the
young lady's defender. On his return to this
city he gave out that he had been to
pointÃ in the interior looking for capital
to invest in his scheme.
This incident in the career of Mr.
Simonds is made more interesting by the
fact that a few months ago Miss Lottie
Best became the wife of Mr. Flint, and
Mr. and Mrs. Flint are now living at San
Leandro.
The next escapade of Mr. Simonds was
with Miss Shaw, a schoolteacher, whom
he tried hard to win for his wife. It is be
lieved that the "Martha Shaw" to whom
he leaves $5000 in his will is the teacher
referred to.
His continued presence in the office of
the M. J. Keller Company gave rise to the
rumor that the firm was in the hands of a
receiver. This was industriously circu
lated by Mr. Keller's enemies, and not
until he made the announcement that he
did not owe a cent and asked Mr. Simonds
to vacate was the rumor stopped.
"I was very much surprised to see that
Simonds left a will, as he told me that he
had nothing," said W. G. Palmantier,
president of the Central Bank to-night.
"When he laid his railroad schemes be
fore me I at once asked him who was
backing him. He told me that he could
not divulge the information at the time,
and I tcld him that unless he could do so
I dirt not care to hear any more. He never
came near me again, but I heard of him
from various quarters and I am greatly
surprised that the old fellow should have
made any one believe he had an es
tate."
It is learned that J. C. Simonds soon
after leavinz Oakland was placed in a
lunatic asylum on Ward Island, N. V.,
where he died. It is the opinion of all
his acquaintances in this county that his
mind was tottering when in Oakland.
It i 3 believed by his Oakland friends
and creditors that Mrs. Henrietta Rosen
garden, the typewriter to whom Simonds
willed his estate, will receive no more
valuable legacy than the paper on which
the will is written.
Foote Kettches Home.
OAKLAND, Cal., Aug. 7.â W. W. Foote
reached home to-day after an absence of
six weeks. He was a delegate to the
Democratic National Convention and at
tended all of the other gatherings, visiting
in the East and Canada between times. In
speaking of the political situation he said :
"A rattier amusing incident oeeured
while I was in New York. One of the
papers published a bet ol $10,000 to $4000
that McKinley would be elected. I sent
down immediately to take it, but I could
not get a nickel. Charles Lane, chairman
of the National Silver Convention, offered
to take it at any time, but there was no
money insight. It was all a case of bluff
and W6 tried to call it."
In the days of Queen Elizabeth each
guest at a dinner party brought his own
knife and spoon.
THE SAJN UKANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, AUGUST 8, 1896.
THE ISSUE MUST
BE SQUARELY MET
Dr. McLean's Opposition
May Retard Harbor
Improvement.
SOME UNSEEN POWER.
Said to Be* at Work in Oppo
sition to the Claim of
Oakland.
CONFERENCE TO BE CALLED.
Petitions Have So Rattled the Wash
ington Officials That They Enow
Not How to Act
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Aug. 7. )
The dispatch from Washington pub
lished in to-day's papers regarding the
appropriation for the improvement of
Oakland harbor will probably be the
means of bringing about harmony between
the two cities. It now looks as if there
was danger of loping the appropriation
hecause of the strife between Oakland and
Alameda.
Several business men discussed the mat
ter this morning, and it was decided to
arrange a conference between committees
from both cities, Senator Perkins, Con
gressman Hilborn and Colonel Suter of
the Engineer Corps. It is believed in Oak
land that the people of Alameda are not
in accord with tl:e petition of Health
Officer McLean of Alameda, and that the
trouble has arisen over a misapprehension
of facts.
The difficulty has all arisen over the pe
tition of Dr. McLean. It was signed by
Mr. Hilborn and Senator Perkins, while
they believed that it merely called for the
improvement or the harbor and not for
what is known as the tidal canal.
A few days ago Mr. Hilborn told the
merchants of Oakland who are interested
in the harbor that he would never have
signed it had he read it, and expressed his
willingness to tell Colonel Suter that the
petition misrepresented his views.
It is the opinion of all concerned that
there is some other force at work that
is tending to block the work other than
the single petition of Dr. McLean of Ala
meda.
Colonel Mendell and Colonel Suter have
both recommended that Oakland harbor
be completed first, and yet the officials at
Washington now threaten to delay the
work until the two cities can agree. E. C.
Sessions, Edson F. Adams, M. J. Keller,
J. P. Taylor and several others are of the
opinion that if a conference can be ar
ranged between nil the parties interested
a mutual agreement can be arrived at so
that work can be carried on at once.
It is very probable that work will be
commenced at both ends of the harbor,
now that the work is placed on the con
tinual contract list. As most of the
people who signed Dr. McLean's petition
have signed a counter-petition stating that
they signed originally under a mistaken
notion, the Oaklanders think that Dr.
McLean should withdraw his opposition.
This, however, he is not likely to do.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Aug. 7.â Dr. John T.
McLean, Health Officer of the city, who
returned but a month ago from Washing
ton, D. C, is more than pleased at the re
sult of his labors there, as evinced by the
information in to-day's Cail from the
Capital city that the improvements to
Oakland harbor would not be contracted
for until the Oakland- Alameda contro
versy was settled.
"When in 1874 Congress approved of the
Secretary of War's proposal to construct a
harbor and canal from San Antonio
estuary to San Leandro Bay," said the
doctor this morninsr, "appropriations
were made for carrying out the work.
Alameda is not antagonistic to Oakland,
bur. she does not want ths original plan
deviated from. That, in the words of the
engineer's reports presented to Congress,
was, 'Oakland and Alameda will have a
fine land-locked harbor when the work we
have described is completed.' "
To complete that work the engineers
held that" the construction of a canal be
tween the estuary and San Leandro Bay
was a necessity. * The harbor vas not to
be lor Oakland solely, and the ebD and
flow of the tides through the canal was to
scour and dredge the estuary.
Providing a harbor accessible for the
usual sea-going vessels and securing the
maximum tidal areas is all that the efforts
of the Federal Government are concerned
in. Quoting from the report the doctor j
said: "This done, whatever shall remain
in the way of providing conveniences and
accommodations for commerce may, we
think, with propriety be left to the com
mercial interests concerned.
"I was talking on the boat the other day
with Mr. E ison Adams and Mr. Kellogg
on the matter. I told them we were not
against Oakland having a dredger, all we
wished was to have one at our end too.
You see the next Congress will provide
an appropriation of $150,000 to $200,000 for
this work, and Alameda will emphasize
most particularly the necessity of the ori
ginal plan being aJ he red to. By the en
gineer's statement it is highly probable
that little or no dredging would be re
quired if the canal were completed.
-What Colonel Suter thinks of the mat
ter I cannot say until I receive a copy of his
report, which I hope to have next week.
But whatever he may think the economic
and commercial interests of Alameda de
mand that the canal shall be finished at
the earliest possible moment."
A Busy Meeting.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Aur. 7.â The advisory
committee of the Alameda Republican
Club finished a lot of business last night.
Chairman Taylor announced that the
three Republican clubs in the city had
agreed to participate In the naming of the
twelve election officers. The Veteran
Club was to have the four judges, the four
inspectors and lour clerks being divided
equally between tho other iwo clubs. For
the primary the city has been divided into
four districts: Firstâ Precincts Twelve and
Thirteen; polling place, William Holtz'
office, Webster street. Secondâ Precincts
Eight, Nine, Ten and Eleven* polling
place, Encinal Hall. Thirdâ Precincts
Three, Four and Seven; polling place
1528 Park street. Fourthâ Precincts One'
Two, Five and Six; polling place, the car
penter-shop of Scholten & Burgner, nar
row-gauge station, Park street.
It was decided to organize a drill corps
and to nominate delegates for the pri
maries next Thursday night. Mr. Mackie
and Mr. Taylor clashed swords on the
proposition, but Mr. Mackie's contention
prevailed.
Company 6.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Aug. 7.â For over
three months the war has been smolder
ing in Company G, breaking out at times
into almost open rebellion. Colonel Fair
banks paid sundry visits to pour oil on
troubled waters, but his efforts were of no
avail. The majority of the company said
tbeir captain. William F. Chipman, was
incompetent, and refused to be appeased.
An arbitration committee appointed to
establish a modus Vivendi reoorted its
labors had accomplished nothing. Dis
cipline had to be enforced, so thirty-four
of the rank and file were dismissed for the
good of the service and their places were
taken by recruits drummed up from the
outside.
The dismissed malcontents joined Com
pany A of Oakland and it was thought the
trouble was all over.
A surprise was furnished last night by
Captain Chipman tenderine his resigna- ,
tion as commander of Company G, the
same to take effect irom September 30.
He refused to reconsider his determina
tion, and it is understood would have
done so before only he did not wish to re
sign under fire. First Liautenant Simp
son will in all probability be elected to the
vacancy.
Lieutenant Dohrmann was unanimously
re-elected as second lieutenant last night.
Major Halstead came over from San Fran
cisco to superintend the electiou.
A Day in Bohemia.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Aug. 7.â A highly
successful entertainment was given in Ar
mory Hall this evening by the Boys' Brig
ade, entitled "A Day In Bohemia." It
consisted of a series of representations de
picting the camp life the boys had enjoyed
during their vacation. The programme
was as follows:
Music, reveille, inspection, recitation by Mrs.
George Sturtevant, mess call, soprano solo by
Mrs. Allardyce, church call, guard mount,
open camp, flute solo by Henry Fine, mess
call, court-martial, mess call, music, dress pa
rade, retreat, service, camp fire, snipe hunt,
vocal duet by Mr. and Mrs. Allftrdyce, tattoo,

IT WAS NOT A BET.
Williams Loaned His Money to Bray
nard to Make a Show-
Ing.
OAKLAND, Cal., Aug. 7. â City At
torney Charles H. Braynard of Redding
was before Justice Lawrence, sitting for
Justice Clift, to-day for an examination
on the charge of duping C. H. Williams
out of $500 by means of a fake foot race at
Shell Mound Park last month. Prose
cuting Attorney H. A. Melvin was as
sisted by R. 8. Ash of San Francisco, and
the defense was conducted by Thomas J.
Garrity and Emil Nusbaumer.
Williams was on the stand all day. He
related loaning the money to Braynard to
"flash," and how it was snatched from
him. Braynard had promised to return
the money, but never did, hence his
arrest. He declared he never bet on the
race, but simply loaned the money to let
his attorney make a showing.

SAVED BY A SQUAW.

Careful Plans to Capture
the Expedition.
AN OFFICER FOR THE SOUTH.
Has Walked Three Thousand Four
Hundred Miles by the Side of
His Caravan.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Aug. 7. J
J. P. Ware of Oklahoma passed through
Oakland to-day with the most original
carayansery that was ever seen outside of
a circus. Ware has traveled 3600 miles,
of which distance be has tramped 3400 be
side his trusty team.
There is nothing of the mendicant in
Ware's nature or trip. He is a sturdy old
Confederate officer, 65 years of age, and he
travels with his two boys, who are 11 and
13 years old.
Ware's wauon is an interesting creation.
It is painted in red and green ana con
tains parlor, kitchen and bedroom. It
may be said to consist of two stories. The
first is devoted to a picture gallery, and
this is the source of his income. There
are three magnifying glasse3 on each side,
and on looking through splendid views of
the Civil War can be seen. Ware has

From Massacre.
passed through hundreds of towns, and
although he asks currency In return for a
peep at his views, he has taken all manner
of produce in exchange.
Fifteen months ago Ware and his boys
decided to shake off the dust of Oklahoma
and travel for a profession. They passed
through New Mexico, Texas and Arizona
and ali through fair Southern California,
and the same two old horses have hauled
the outfit every foot of the way.
After leaving Phcenix Ware's life was
undoubtedly saved by a squaw. The
Apaches were celebrating all kinds of war
dances on the plains, and Ware tried to
insure the good graces of the chief by
making him all kinds of presents. The
offerings, however, seem to have excited
the cupidity of the Indians, for just before
Ware left three bucks left the camp and
went out in different directions. After
their departure a squaw told Ware that
they had determined to steal the whole
outfit when it started on its journey. She
made Ware understand that his only
safety was in returning to Phoenix and
her advice was heeded. He learned after
ward that six whites who left just after
him mysteriously disappeared.
Ware says that there is a good deal of
hardship connected with the life and that
on one occasion their lives were saved by
finding a few drops of water in the hoof
mark of a horse. He intends to keep on
the road and says that the picture gallery
is just enough to insure a living.
BIBLE SEMINARY COURSES
President S. M. Jefferson Outlines
the Studies to Be
Taken Up.
Narrow Escape of a Lorin Family
From Death by Fireâ Dwelling
Burned to the Ground.
BERKELEY, Cal., Aug. 7.â The
courses of study for the Berkeley Bible
Seminary, to be opened next week under
the auspices of the Christian church, have
been decided upon. Following is the
complete outline as prepared by President
J. M. Jefferson:
Two regular courses are offered, a classical
and an English, course, extending through
three years. The classical course requires a
knowledge of Hebrew and Greek, and em
braces all the branches of Bible study that are
commonly taught in Bible seminaries. It is
iniended especially for, those who desire to
make most thorough preparation for the
Christian ministry or a Biblical profession.
1 he English branch does not require a knowl
edge of either Hebrew or Greek, and is other
wise less critical and comprehensive than the
classical course. It is intended for students
who for any reason cannot take the classical
course, and especially for those who desire to
fit themselves lor some particular department
of Christian work, evangelistic or missionary,
or for more efficient service in the church, the
Sunday-school or other fields of usefulness.
Each oi these regular courses is intended to
be thoroughly scientific in principle and
method, and sufficiently comprehensiva to
adequately meet tue needs of those for whom
it is especially proposed.
Besides these regular courses oi instruction
lecture courses will be given by professors of
the seminary and by other persons, both resi
dent and non-resident, who are qualified to
treat the subjects chosen. These lectures will
bo open to all students and to the general
public. Persons who do not desire to take
either of the courses in their completeness
may, with the consent of the faculty, be ad
mitted to any class in the seminary for which
they are prepared.
Among the subjects to be treated in the
classical course are: Introduction to the study
of theology as the scieÃce of religion, intro
duction to the study of the New Testament,
Biblical interpretation, Old Testament his-
Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria.
Tory, critical study of the life of Christ, criti
cal study of the Acts of the Apostles, exegtical
study of the Epistie to the Romans in Greek,
preparation and delivery of sermons, pulpit
elocution and oratory, evidences of Christian
ity and the teachings of Jesus.
The English course wili include the study of
the following: Old Testament history, Bibli
cal interpretation, the life of Christ, the Acts
of the Apostles, critical study of the Gospel
according to St. Matthew, in English, prepara
tion aud delivery of sermons, puipit elocution
and oratory, the use of the English Bible in
evangelistic work and the evidences of Chris
tianity.
Narrowly Escaped Death.
BERKELEY, Cal., Aug. 7.â The resi
dence of S. G. McChesney, at the corner of
Tyler and King streets, was burned to
the ground between 3 and 4 o'clock this
morning, the fire companies not being
able to furnish any water for the quench
ing of the flames because of the lack of
available hydrants.
The dwelling was occupied by Mr. and
Mrs. McChesney, four children and Mrs.
Brown, a cousin of Mr. McChnsney. The
inmates of the house were ali asleep
when the flames broke out, and only had
time to hurriedly escape from the fire.
The house was valued at $2000. and was
insured. The origin of the flames is a
mystery, all of those in the house having
been asleep for several hours when the
flames broke out.

PEIRSOL ANSWERS.
Thinks Davie Did Well With Five
Falsehoods aud One
Truth.
OAKLAND, Cal., Aug 7.â City Attor
ney Peirsol issued the following signed
statement to-day in answer to Mayor Da
vie's recent charges:
The Mayor is reported as saying among some
irrelevant and foolish surmises:
That Mr. Wilson and myself, in directing
that the deportments should not be used as a
political machine in the interest of any candi
date, were carrying out a cut-ann-dried plan
to intimidate ceTiain men in the department
who might work adversely to our interests.
The statement is absolutely false.
Secondâ That it was our plan and ideÂ» to
have a general overhauling in these depart
ments and repiace all the oid members with
our friends. That this statement is untrue
will be readily seen by tho?e who have watched
our course.
Thirdâ That he has foiled our would-be plans
to a certain extent by insisting that no man
should be dismissed without a trial. This is
not only untrue, but the Mayor was opposed
to hearing tne trials of men under charges
and refused to hear their defenses in several
cases.
Fourthâ That some men have been dis
missed. This is true, but not without investi
gation.
Fifthâ That their places have been filled
with the friends of either Mr. Wilson or my
self and that these friends only got position
by promising to support us politically. This
statement is untrue.
Sixthâ That it is the purpose of the new
ruie to prevent tho old members from support
ing tiuy one else. This is also without asliadow
of truth.
Now, we find five falsehoods and one truth
in the interview, and in order not to speak
evil of magistrates let us say he has done un
expectedly well. J. K. Peirsol,
City Attorney.

A Dangerous Practice.
OAKLAND, Cal., Aug. 7.â Chief Fair
made a discovery to-day that will result
in arrest the next time the practice of it
comes to his knowledge. He received a
message from the Winter's Hotel that
there was danger of a fire this afternoon,
and on making an investigation he found
that an attempt had been made to clean
the flue by means of coal oil liberally dis
tributed in the chimney. The flue had
become heated and there was danger of it
taking fire. Chief Fair has given notice
that he will at once arrest anybody whom
he discovers trying to clean a "flue by
means of coal oil or explosives.
Another Pastor Resign*.
OAKLAND. Cal., Aug. 7.â The Pilgrim
Congrecational Church of East Oakland
has lost its pastor through the effects
of hard times. Dr. M. Willett, who has
filled that pulpit so satisfactorily, has no
tified the trustees of his resignation. He
is in the East visiting his old home. He re
ceived a call to the Congregational Church
of Decorah, lowa, and accepted the same.
The church here was in arrears in pay
ing his salary, which may have had some
thing to do with his leaving.
JENNINGS MAKES REPLY,
The Accused Attorney Protests
Against His Proposed
Disbarment.
Cassias M. Jennings, the attorney whose
disbarment was requested last week by
Byron Waters on the ground of unprofes
sional conduct, baa filed with the Supreme
Court a spirited answer to that gentle
man's accusations. He states that for four
teen years he has practiced law in this
City and elsewhere, during all which pe
riod no breath of scandal has ever touched
him. He prays that Mr. Waters' petition
for his disbarment be ruled out and the
accusation against him dismissed.
In his answer Mr. Jennings acknowl
edges his business relations with young
Allison, but denies that the connection
admits any unprofessional interpretation.
Allison told him the name of several
persons who had been injured in railway
accidents of various sorts, but there was
no agreement between himself and Alli
son as to any division of fees which Jen
nings might receive in the event of the
injured persons intrusting their cases to
his professional care.
Mr. Jennings admits having kept cer
tain memoranda of the information fur
nished him by Allison, but denies in the
most emphatic terms that he kept the
notes for any corrupt or underhanded
use. He says Allison's presence in his
office was due entirely to his own hospi

SCHOOL DIRECTORS
TO GRAND JURORS
A Caustic Reply to a Re
cently Sent Com
munication.
THE WEBSTER SCHOOL.
Public Inquisitors Practically
Told to Mind Their Own
Business.
FIGURES AND FACTS GIVEN.
A Modification of Recommendations
Asked For in the Final Report.
of the Jury.
Six members of the Board ot Education
signed a caustic reply to a recent commu
nication of the Grand Jury yesterday and
one that is expected to show the latter
body just how the School Directors feel
regarding interference in educational mat
ters. Some time ago the project of tear
ing down the Webster Primary School
was decided on by a majority in the board
and a special meeting was called to carry
the matter through.
At that meeting, before the business for
which it was called could be concluded, a
communication from the Grand Jury pro
testing against the proposed destruction
was read, the effect being that the board
decided to defer the matter for the time
being.
The reply was as follows:
OFFrcE Board of Education, |
San Francisco, August 7, 1896. j
To the Grand Jury of the City and County of
San J-ranciscoâ Gentlemen: On the 31st of
July a communication from your honorable
body was forwarded to the Board of Educa
tion, in which you earnestly protested against
the closing oi the Webster Primary School.
Although we were fully aware of our right to
proceed in the matter without regard to your
protest, and though we were not convinced
thnt you were right and we were wrong, we
felt that courtesy to a co-ordinate branch of
the government demanded that your commu
nication should be treated with respectful
consideration. The Grand Jury is a body
whose recommendation should have weight,
and we would not detractfrom its dignity and
authority by ignoring its advice. We, how
ever, leel that we owe it to ourselves and to
the community to briefly state the reasons
that actuated us in the contemplated action,
as your summary proceedings, taken without
consulting any of us, or giving us an oppor
tunity of explaining the situation, might be
considered a reflection on our discretion, or an
intimation that we were influenced by motives
other than tne best interests of the schools.
The Duildings accommodating the Webster
Primary School are situated in the rear of the
Lincoln School building. On the south the
lot abuts against the back yards of a number
of small residences on Jessie street. Against
the rear of the lot the brick walls of the Par
rott building lower high in the air, completely
shutting off the eastern sun. On the north thte
disreputable backs of the offensive lodging
houses and saloons that stretch from the Par
rott building to Fifth strait present a pano
rama of ugliness and demoralization that no
child should be forced to face. The shut-in
yard is covered by well-worn planks and the
general appearance is one of dilapidation.
There are three shabby buildings, perhaps not
worse than the average of those that the parsi
mony of San Francisco compels us to blush
for. The entrance to the lot is through the
comparatively narrow passage at the north
and south of the Lincoln School building.
More than one Grand Jury has referred to the
danger of life and limb and has recommended
that some other provision be made for the
school. That it is an improper and dangerous
location has been matter of notoriety tor many
years, and is admitted by all excepting those
interested in maintaining existing conditions.
The San Francisco School Department is for
tunate in having retained the magnificent
property on the southeast corner of Market
and Fifth streets with 275 feet frontage on
each street. It is the finest unimproved lot of
its size in the City, and the possibilities in
way of income ere very great. At present the
north 100 feet covered by cheap buildings, all,
excepting one, of wood, brings an annual in
come of about $40,000. It the 175 by 275 feet
now occupied by the Lincoln and the Webster
schools could be cleared of buildings and the
whole property could be leased for, say fifty
years, enabling the lessees to erect building's
appropriate to the lot and the location, a
rental could be received that would largely
pay the City's proportion of the amount re
quired to support our schools, or that if ap
propriated to the erection of school buildings
to replace the poor structures that now dis
grace us would soon bring San Francisco to an
equal rank with most of the villages in the
State.
It is the duty of the proper authorities to
lease this property at the earliest moment
consistent with the best interests of the pupils
now attending the two schools, and the pro
posed closing of the Webster School was the
first step in that direction. This lot is too
valuable to be used as a school site, and at the
same time from its location in the heart of
business activity is unfit for such use. The
Lincoln School must eventually be located
elsewhere, and if necessary a lot most be pur
chased for it, but one school can be provided
for with half the difficulty of two, and it is
therefore evident that if the Webster School
can without hardship or injustice be now dis
continued the final step will be much easier.
The present enrollment of the Webster
School is 763. Of this number 243 live nearer
to other schools. As they ought to attend
these schools in any event they may be left
out of tht calculation.
Witnin a reasonable radius of the Webster
School ar? the following vacant classrooms to
which its pupils might be sent:
Lincoln (excluding 4 in basement), 2; Whit
tier, distant 2700 teet, 3; Harrison, distant
3t>oo feet, 2; Jeffer>o:!, distant 4200 feet, 8;
Cleveland, 3. Capacity of 18 rooms 900
pupiis.
These distances ate from building to build
ing, and are in excess of the average distance
to be traveled, as the greater portion of the
pupils live south of the Webster and nearer to
the other schools. If, as would appear from
the above statement, the pupils can without
hardship be accommodated in these vacant
rooms, we submit that on the score of economy
alone it is our duty to close the school, since it
would effect a saving in salary of about $5000
a year.
The action proposed is such as any sensible
man would follow in bis own business, look
ing to economy, and is especially necessary in
view of the fact that the Board of Supervisors
do not recognize tiie constantly increasing
necessary ccst of conducting our schools, but
confine us to an inadequate appropriation.
The Finance Committee oi the Board of
Supervisors recently intimated that it is our
duty to reduce expenses and assist in lower
ing the levy by consolidating classes or
bcliools. Your honorable body has likewise
urged economy and care in the disbursement
of public funds.
While the Board of Education has by the
provisions of the consolidation act an unques
tioned right to abolish a school without re
gard to the interest of its teachers, dismissing
the principal or assigning her to the position
of a class teacher with a corresponding de
crease of salary, it would not willingly do so.
In the present instance the principal has suc
cessfully conducted one of our largest schools
for many years and is entitled to our con
sideration. It would be a serious blow to re
mand her to th*" ranks, and we considered our
selves fortunate in an opportunity to close the
school without injury or loss to her.
It is very rarely that a principal resigns,
giving us this privilege, but at present there
is a vacancy through the resignation of Miss
Robertson of the Conte Primary. It was pro
posed to transfer this school to Miss Murphy of
the Jefferson, and to assign Miss Manning to
the principalship of the latter school, but six
blocks distant from the Webster. It is a brick
building in good conaiuon, containing six
teen clais-roorns and a large assembly hall.
The yard is sunny and well planked. It is our
belief that Miss Manning would fill this build
ing and speedily bring the school to an equal
rank with the Webster. The resolution direct
ing the transfer ordered the superintendent to
do all in his power to build up the school to
its lull capacity, and to this end he was di
rected to allow her to retain the fifth grade
heretofore Bent to a grammar school, and to
freely grant any applications for attendance
from parts of the city outside the district.
The proposed action in no manner reflected
upon the principal, and In every respect the
utmost consideration was shown her. It was
especially provided that, whether the Jeffer
son' School should increase to sixteen classes
or not, she should suffer no loss in salary. The
teachers were also to be fully piotected. It
being provided that until given permanent
classes they should be placed on the list of
unassigned teachers without change of salary.
To recapitulate: It was proposed to abolish
the Webster School for the reasons :
Firstâ That its location and surroundings
are dangerous to life, health and morals.
Secondâ That a necessary first step betaken
to secure a large income from property too
valuable (and also unfit) for school purposes.
Thirdâ That it is not necessary to continue
it to properly provide for the children in its
neighborhood.
Fourthâ That it is called for as a necessary
measure of economy.
Fifthâ That it may now be closed without in
jury to principal or teachers.
We respectfully ask that you may make such
inquiry as you see fit into the facts herein
stated, and that in your final report you make
such modifications in your recommendations
as you find to be just. Charles H. Hawley,
H. C. Hendebson,

WELCOME OPPONENTS.
The Woman-Suffrage Bureau OfferÂ« ItÂ«
Hospitality to Those Unfriendly
to the Cause.
A sub-committee for the reception of
callers has been appointed by the Woman
Suffrage State Central Committee consist
ing of six members, carefully selected as
being foremost among the most eloquent
and convincing speakers in sympathy with
the cause. The ladies will be in attend
ance from 1 until 5 o'clock each afternoon
on the days respectively assigned to each,
and desire particularly to meet conscien
tious voters who may be opposed to woman
suffrage.
As at present arranged, the committee
will be on duty as follows: Mondays, Mrs.
John F. Swift; Tuesdays, Mrs. Austin
Sperry; Wednesdays, Miss Mnry E. Hay,
secretary of the State Central Committee;
Thursdays, Mrs. A. A. Sargent: Fridays,
Mrs. Neliie Holbrook-Bhnn; Saturdays,
Miss Susan B. Anthony.
Among yesterday's visitors were the
Rev. Mr. Brown ot Stanford University,
Mrs. J. F. Swift, Colonel Charles H. Blinn
and Mrs. Blinn. But these are all friends
of the cause, welcome indeed, yet in no
need of conversion. The ladies at the
woman-suffrage bureau want to see anti
suffragists however rabid, and bring them
over to the opposite view; but as one of
the most charming attaches of the bureau
asked yesterday :
"Where are the anti-suffragists any
how?"
OAKLAND'S WATER FRONT
The Famous and Important Case
Now Before the Supreme
Court.
Attorneys Argue For and Against the
City's Rhht to Alienate the
Property.
The Oakland water-front cases are now
being heard on appeal by the Supreme
Court. Maps and diagrams of all sizes
and colors were on exhibition in the court
room all day, and the well-worn history of
the now famous case was rehearsed in de
tail.
Attorney A. A. Moore, representing the
Oakland Water-front Company, gave an
able presentment of his side of the case
yesterday morning. He contended that
the municipality of Oakland had the legal
right and power to alienate the water
front lands or any part of them, and held
that the deeds and grants so alienating
them were undoubtedly valid and suffi
cient.
This view was ably combated by Wil
liam R. Davis, attorney for the city of
Oakland. He recounted that in 1852, when
the municipality of Oakland was incorpo
rated, the line or strip of land between
high water mark and the deep water chan
nel, comprising several thousands of acres,
was set apart for common uses. He re
ferred significantly to the Carpentier
transfer, calling attention to the circum
stance that two out of the four Trustees
who authorized the conveyance were
Carpentier's partners. In very convinc
ing terms he contended that the convey
ance was invalid, the land in question
having been irrevocably set apart for pub
lic uses.
Ex- Judge Garber in reply will argue
this morning.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, AUGUST 8, 1896,
RETURNS WITH EVIDENCE
Montana's Chief Justice Did
Win His Suit in Los
Angeles.
The Judge Arrives Here With Two
Important Witnesses to a Mar
riage Ceremony.
Judge W. Y. Pemberton, Chief Justice
of the Supreme Court of Montana, and a
possibility for Governor by a combination
of Democrats, Populists and silver men,
returned to the Grand yesterday afternoon
with his bride.
It was only a few weeks ago that the
Chief Justice came here on his first visit
to this State, although he had lived in
Montana since 1863. He was on his way
to Southern California. A short time after
his departure the news reached this City
that Judge Pemberton had been married
in Los Angeles. The fact was almost dis
credited by his old friends, wbo talked it
over. And other men from Montana were
equally surprised.
The Judge is now on h''s way home to
Helena, where he holds court, and he is
taking with him charming evidence of the
reliability of the meager telegraphic
reports. * With the newly married couple
is Miss Hoover of Helena.
Judge Pern berton will De remembered as
the man who emphatically declared that
he "never saw a long-haired fellow with a
gun on his hip wbo wasn't an infernal
coward."

NEAGLE AND HIS
GUN IN COURT,
The "Vigilance Committee"
Takes Up the Col
lins Case.
ARRESTED AND BAILED.
The Southern Pacific Gun-Fighter
May Explain Some
Things.
DAVE THREATENED CULBRETH
It Transpires That Mr. Neagle Has a
Habit of Showing His Gun to
Local Editors.
David Neagle, the Arizona gun fighter,
who killed David Terry, who bumped
the head of A. J. Collins against the
Southern Pacific building and who gui-
Charles Wesley Reed, Attorney for A. J. Collins, Who Is Prosecuting Dave
> eagle on a Battery Charge.
rtly threatened the life of James H.
Barry, the editor of the Star, the other
day, has been arrested for his assault
on Collins.
His arrest on the mere charge of bat
tery is the peaceable and conservative
action of the "vigilance committee"
which has been talked about in a very
general way for several days.
It has developed that Mr. Neagle has
been in the habit of thinking that San
Francisco is in Arizona.
B. E. Culbreth, editor of the Argus,
says that Neagle has threatened his life
on account of newspaper criticism, as
Neagle threatened Editor Harry of the
Star the other day, and Sir. Culbreth is
authority for the information that Nea
gle, shortly after the killing of Terry,
similarly threatened A. B. Henderson,
then the managing editor of the Exam
iner.
The Police Court trial of David Kea
gle for his street assault on A. J. Col
lins, in supposed protection of H. K.
Huntington, promises to be an extremely
interesting one.
David Neaele was arrested yesterday for
that assault on A. J. Collins, the dis
charged Southern Pacific employe, and
his arrest was the result of the action of
the body of citizens which has been darkly
hinied at as a "vigilance committee."
There is plenty of confidential evidence
that after Neagle' s threatening assault on
James H. Barry, editor of the Star, plenty
of citizens were ready to request of Mr.
Neagle his absence from the City, but Mr.
Barry opposed vigorously any summary
action. The result was that a number of
citizens, among whom W. M. Cubery, the
printer, was prominent, decided to prose
cute Neagle in the regular courts of justice
for the assault upon Collins which brought
forth Barry's comments offensive to
Neagle.
Charles Wesley Reed was employed to
prosecute the case. Collins yesterday
swore to a Police Court complaint and
now the right of David Neagle to bump
Collins' head against a buttress in behalf
of H. E. Huntington will be settled in a
lower court of justice.
Mr. Neagle is an extremely interesting
man. For instance, it turns out that ed
itors are his frequent food â that is, San
Francisco editors. Mr. Neagle is doomed
to a rather prosaic life in serving the law
and claims departments of the Southern
Pacific Company, in dieging up witnesses
in damage claims at $150 a month, and it
is only occasionally that the Southern Pa

cific Company is able to make life inter
esting to him by sending him out to pro
tect an express train when a tip that a
train is to be held up is received.
This is what R. E. Culbretb, editor and
proprietor* of the Argus, said yesterday :
"My life has beon threatened on two
occasions by Dave Neagle. At the time of
the killing of Terry I was roasting Neagle
rather severely in my paper. He met me
one day on the street and said that if I
didn't stop it he would kill me.
"He also at about that time went into
the office oi A. B. Henderson, then manag
ing editor of the Examinee, and threatened
his life if the paper did not cease its com
ments upon his actions in the Terry
tragedy. Neagle seems to bear a special
antipathy to newspaper men.
"The second time that he threatened me
was some six monrhs ago. In the Argus
I had been denouncing the policy of the
Southern Pacific Company. This angered
Neagle, who approached me in an in
sulting way at the corner of Post and
Kearney streets and declared if I contin
ued my attacks upon the company he
would 'cut my throat from ear to ear.'
"That is a favorite expression of his. I
paid no attention to his threats and have
had nothing to do with him since."
â¢
THE ARREST OF NEAGLE.
Surrendered Himself After a Tip
and Cave Bail.
At 10:30 o'clock a. m. yesterday Mr. Col
linÃ and Mr. Reed appeared in Judge
Low's court provided with a complaint
charging Dave Neagle with battery on A.
J. Collins and with disturbing the peace.
Collins swore to the complaint and Reed
held a few moments' consultation with
the Judge at his desk. Judge Low issued
the warrants and decided to name the or-
dinary bail of $100 on each charge.
Some grapevine telegraph line soon con
veyed the information of what had been
done to the yellow "knoefcery," and at a
little after 1 p. m. Mr. Neagle appeared at
the Central Police Station, accompanied
by an assistant claims attorney of the
Southern Pacific Company, formally sur
rendered hiniself, deposited $200 bail and
was released. The case will probably be
set for trial to-day.
This will be an unusually interesting
Police Court case. It is chuck full of
human characters and human life and the
ways of this queer world.
Mr. Collins, it will be remembered by
most people, is the man who was for years
a Southern Pacific machinist in Arizona,
who after his discharge suffered a long
series of troubles, sicknesses and indigni
ties because, justly or unjustly, he asked
consideration at the hands of the railroad.
Mr. Collins tried vainly to get an audience
with H. E. Huntington, the railroad mag
nate and the confidential nephew of a
greater magnate. He failed, and while
selling razor-paste on the sidewalk in front
of the big railroad building Mr. Hunting
ton came alone and nodded, perhaps fear
fully, perhaps good-naturedly, to Collins.
The emboldened Collins accosted Hunting
ton peaceably and with arms folded,
stating what he believed to be his claims
and his wrongs.
It is the way of the world and of the law
that one man, though a stranger, may at
least accost another man. The man ac
costed may, if he choose, not listen and
walk peaceably and carelessly and even
contemptuously on, having no grievance
unless the accosting stranger follows and
becomes annoying or aggressive.
It is not yet in evidence that Collins,
the razor-paste man, was aggressive or
threatening. Perhaps Mr. Huntington
really was slightly annoyed.
But then this case is wholly different
from otherwise similar ones that occur be
tween ordinary citizens every day in the
street. Mr. Huntington is his uncle's
nephew and a big man himself with a
neat rosewood desk in a big corner
room, and Mr. Collins, who may or may
not be a somewhat foolish man, sells razor
paste now for a living.
Then Mr. Huntington happened to be
accompanied by David Neagle, the man
who numbers the late Judge Terry among
his slain. It is not every man who can
have Dave at his side when he is annoyed
by some fellow accosting him on the street.
But Mr. Neagle was there, and, according
to all the stories yet told, he just grabbed
the fool Collins by the collar and by an
other firmly displaced part of his clothing
and threw him arouud vigorously and
hurled him in the direction of down street.
Then, it is said by Collins and all the
witnesses who have yet told their stories,
the shotgun messenger and mining
camp Deputy Sheriff seized Col
lins by the throat with one hand, while
with the other he bumped the Collins
head vigorously against the granite silis
of the big knockery close at hand. Then
Collins w.Â»p physically spurned with the
threat that lie would get killed if became
arqund there again bothering railroad
people.
Now all this might not have made Mr.
Collins famous if Editor Barry of the Star
had not "roasted" Neagle somewhat as he
roasted Neagle when Terry was killed,
and if Neagle had not met the intrepid
Barry on Montgomery street and with his
hand very meaningly on his gun warned
Mr. Barry not to do it again. Neagle
practically threatened Barry's life if
further criticism was indulged "in.
This, last exploit of the bad gunfighter
from Arizona has proved too much for
some people who believe that David
Neagle is not wholly entitled to immunity
from criticism for his deeds as bodyguard
to railroad magnates, and Neagle's prose
cution for his assault on Collins is the
paceable form in which their indignation
has finally found vent.
BARRY UNTERRIFIED.
The Editor In To-day's "Star"
Lashes His Assailant of Monday
In Vigorous Style.
"By nature he is a brute ami a bad
man. 1 '
"There will be no room for the Dave
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, AUGUST 8, 1896.
Neagles and their guns ; then such hired
assassins will not be allowed to live" upon
our fair soil."
"The Southern Pacific Company's hired
assassin."
"Thue Neagle."
"That wretch."
"After a farce of a trial in the Federal
Court he was acquitted for the wanton
killing of Judge Terry."
"We had been attacked by a skunk in
human form."
There has been some curiosity concern
ing the manner in which the Star will
speak to-day about Dave Neagle in view of
the encounter between Neagle and James
H. Barry, the editor of the Star, and also
in view of the threat with which Neagle is
reported to have closed his street inter
view with Barry. The several sentences at
the head of this article are taken from to
day's Star, and all refer to Neagle. They
are evidently written with little or no re
gard to any threats which Neagle may
have uttered at any time. He is reported
to have made many threats at different
times. Neagle is in the City and will
probably read the Star. The extracts
given in the foregoing are taken from a
copy of the paper which was secured in
advance of the regular puDlication.
Not only has Mr. Barry goaded Neagle
in this. At the beginning of alive-column
article which has the caption. "'The South
ern Pacific Company's Hired Assassinâ
The Stayer of Judge David S. Terry and
Lesser Lights Assaults, Pulls His Gun and
Threatens to Murder the Editor of the
Star," is the following:
In last week's Star, we printed an article
headed "Murderer Neagle Still on Deck."
We referred to Dave Neagle, who on August
11, 1889, in cold blood, without cause, while
under the protection of United States Justice
Field, murdered David S. Terry.
That he was hired to commit the dastardly
deed we had not and have not the slightest
doubt.
He had killed men of lesser note before and
with equal safety to himself.
He was and is proud of his record as a roan
slayer, but his "proudest act"â one of which
he delights to boastâ was the murder of Terry;
for he was a "shining light," and the act gave
him not only National notoriety, but also pre
ferment.
Judge Field publicly presented him with a
watch in recognition of his "valor," while the
Sharon "gang" gave him a lump sum of money
and a Jarge annuity for life.
He is now in the employ of the Southern
Pacific, and his real duty is to terrorize or kill
all who may be prominently obnoxious to that
corporation.
This is followed up by the following:
On Thursday of last week, while in the com
pany of H. E. Huntington and in hi 3 presence,
ne (Neagle) walked up to a peddler who has a
grievance against the Southern Pacific Com
pany, and, as the facts are stated by Mr. Wil
liam M. Cuber7, the well-known printer,
opened the peddier'sbag, thrust his hand in
side of it, examined it, closed the bag suddenly,
violently seized his "enemy" by the throat
and dragged him along the sidewalk until he
reached the Market-street side of the railroad
bnilding, when with the fury of a fiend â
which he is â he dashed the defenseless man's
head repeatedly agninst the stone wall of the
building and threatened him with death. â¢ â¢
It was this cowardly and unprovoked assault
which inspired our article in last week's Star,
which was so offensive to him and his master
that on Tuesday last ne sought our life.
Mr. Barry also says that he had been
informed that Neagle, although cowardly,
was a desperado.
There is much in condemnation of the
Southern Pacific Company. Incidentally
a verse is printed as follows:
We will speak out: we will be heard
Though all earth's systems craclt.
We will not bate a single word,
Nor lake a letter back.
Mr. Barry has evidently tried to give
Dave Neagle provocation. In reference to
the talk about a "vigilance committee" to
deal with Neagle, a small paragraph is ap
pended to the verbal broadside as follows:
Borne of the daily papers intimate that a vig
ilance committee is being formed. We dis
claim all knowledge of and discountenance
any such movement, which, however well in
tentioned, might cause riot and bloodshed
and the lives of innocent men while It would
not serve to correct the evils against which
we are fighting. If it would, then we might
say, ''Go ahead."
CELTIC UNION'S PROJECT
Twenty â¢ Six Irish Societies
United to Build a Grand
Hall.
They Desire to Have a Home That
Will Cost a Quarter of a
Million.
The Celtic Union will hold an important
meeting this evening in K. R. B. Hall for
the purpose of taking further action in
the project of building a handsome hall.
It was stated yesterday by many of the
enthusiastic supporters of the hall prop
osition that success is certain. Anyhow
the various Irish societies of San Fran
cisco are as a unit on it, and for that rea
son decisive progress is expected to be
made at the meeting to-night.
There are twenty-six Irish societies in
the Celtic Union, including the Ancient
Order of Hibernians and the Knights of
St. Patrick, which are among the chief
supporters of the enterprise. They were
brought together mainly through the
efforts of Jeremiah Deasy, Thomas R.
Bannerman and other prominent Irish
men of this City, and now that the union
is a reality the main object for which it
was called into existence will be taken up
with a will.
The plan as now outlined in the rough,
is to form a corporation with a capital
stock of $250,000, to be divided into shares
of a par value that will enable men of
moderate means to become subscribers. A
large share of this stock, it is proposed,
will be taken by the societies. Besides,
several of the bodies in the Celtic Union
are considering grand excursions into the
country and entertainments in town to
raise funds to be presented to the cor
poration. Then when sufficient stock has
been subscribed to warrant the actual
commencement of buying a lot and build
ing a hall, the corporation will begin
business operations.
A wide and pretentious scope is given
the project, for nothing hut a building
that will be an ornament to the City and
up to date in all its appointments is at
present considered. The building is to be
finished in modern style, according to the
plans of its projectors, and to contain
iodgerooms for the societies, a large thea
ter, or meeting-ball, clubrooms, offices, a
banquet-hall, etc. The name may be
Irish-American Hall or Celtic Union Hall,
more likely the latter, which is now most
in favor. The hall will be the meeting
place of all Irish societies in San Fran
cisco, their headquarters as well, and in it
ail affairs connected with these organiza
tions will be held.

MYSTERY OF A STRANGE DISAPPEARNCE.
J. A. Campbell's Story as
Told to the Grand
Jury.
AGED PLANTER'S STRUG
GLE FOR LIBERTY.
Tells of Cruelty to Extort From
Him a Vast Sum of
Money.
A ROBBER'S BULLET GRAZSS HIS
TEMPLE.
0. F. Winthrop and Another Man
Indicted for Robbery and
Assault to Murder.
The Grand Jury held a session yesterday
afternoon and indicted O. F. Winthrop and
John Doe for robbery and assault to mur
der. Winthrop and bis accomplice, who
PLANTER CAMPBELL LEAVING THE JURY ROOM.
is designated in the indictment as John
Doe, are supposed to be the two men who
sought by violence, threats 9f murder and
acts of physical torture to extort $20,000
from James Campbell, a rich Hawaiian
planter, after the capitalist had been lured
or decoyed, according to his story, to a
cottage, 4109 California street.
The dtory told by Campbell to the mem
bers of the Grand Jury was one of tne
most remarkable narratives of cruelty and
crime ever related to eager listeners. The
modest demeanor, the simple bearing and
the straightforward manner of tne brave
old man convinced every member of the
jury present that the narrative was a
plain unadorned statement of facts.
Mr. Campbell told of his visit to San
Jose to arrange for placing his daughter
in school and the chance meeting of
Winthrop at the Hotel Vendome. Win
throp spoke of his invalid wife, and his
own earnest desires that she should visit
the islands for her health.
She had doubts and misgivings about
the Hawaiian climate, and to remove these
from her mind the aged planter was asked
to see the invalid and tell her all about the
climate and the country.
When Mr. Campbell returned from San
Jose to this City Winthrop again met him
at the Occidental Hotel and renewed the
request that he should see his wife. The
two men left the Occidental Hotel together
between 3 and 4 o'clock last Monday after
noon. Mr. Campbell described the jour
ney by the Sacramento-street car line
and the alighting from the car at a
point near the French Hospital, which
was so much further from the hotel than
the planter supposed he was to go that he
remarked the great distance.
The two men entered the house, and
while the planter was seated a masked
man entered the room where he sat, and,
presenting a pistol, commanded him to
throw up his hands. Campbell instantly
jumped to his feet, the whole scheme of
villainy flashing on bis mind at once, and
dealt the masked man a stunning blow.
The robber went down under the force of
the blow, and while on the floor fired his
pistol. The bullet grazed the right side of
the planter's head, just back of the eye. A
struggle ensued, and the capitalist, ob
taining possession of the pistol, managed
to reach the door and get his arm and
shoulder partially through, When he
was struck by Winthrop with a ham
mer or some instrument back of the
ear and felled to the floor. The robbers
then sprang on him, thumped him hard
against the floor, and while he was still
dazed handcuffed him and bound his feet
and arms.
Campbell, dazed, bruised and exhausted
by the powerful struggle for liberty, was
lifted into a chair. His hands were tightly
bound together, his arms were tied to the
armrests of the chair, his feet were
strapped together and a rope placed
around his body and tied behind the
chair. In that position he sat for twenty
hours. His physical suffering was terri
ble and his mental agony intense. All the
money he hadâ s3o6 50â was taken from
him by Winthrop.
From the chair he was taken to the bed
and there chained by chains attached to
staples in the floor. He was gagged so
that he could not make an outcry.
Winthrop offered to release him if he
would sign a check for $20,000 and direct
his wife to get it cashed and pay the
amount over to them. The robbers went
into minute instructions as to how the
money should be obtained, but the im
prisoned planter refused to sign. He told
the robbers that he was an old man and
did not have many years to live so he
would die before be would submit to the
blackmail and extortion. They threat
ened him with .prolonged physical torture
and in the end death if he would not sign,
but he refused to negotiate.
From Tuesday noon until Wednesday
evening at 8 o'clocfe Campbell was in bed,
bound and chained so firmly that he could
not move all day Wednesday. Winthrop
and his accomplice, a younger man, threat
ened and again threatened to induce the
victim to sign a check and a letter to his
wife which had been prepared for his sig
nature. When the robbers found that the
old man was inflexible in his determina
tion to die rather than submit to extortion,
they decided to darken the house, release
the victim and under cover of night aban
don the premises.
.Accordingly at 8 o'clock, or about that
hour, Wednesday evening Mr. Campbell
was unbound and led out of the house by a
rear passage way leading to an alley. The
accomplice of Winthrop escorted the
planter along Third avenue to a p^intnear
Geary street. When a car came in sight
the victim was eiven a nickel to pay his
car fare and advisea to get aboard. This
advice be followed and reached the Occi
dental Hotel about 9 o'clock. His wife was
so overcome with joy at seeing him that
she fainted.
Mr. Campbell was in the jury-room for
nearly a half hour and was questioned
closely as to all the details and incidents
of his detention. When he was excused
as a witness he returned to the inner pri-
vate office of the District Attorney, where
Captain Lees sat while Mr. Campbell was
in the jury-room. A prolonged confer
ence took place in which Mr. Hosmer,
Acting District Attorney, Captain Lees
and Mr. Campbell participated. While
they were engaged in this conference Mrs.
Campbell and Mrs. McFarland came to
the new City Hall to meet Mr. Campbell
and escort him home.
In an interview with a Call reporter
Mr. Campbell said he was recovering from
the excitement and sufferings of imprison
ment, but had not fully recovered. In
answer to an inquiry as to when he would
sail for Honolulu he said: "I am not go
ing away for some time." When asked if
he would remain here until the present
trouble was finally settled he said: "I
cannot say that I will remain that long,
but I will stay lone enough."
The bruise, or abrasion of the right
temple, caused by the robber's bullet is
visible, but is healing. There is a big lump
behind his ear where Winthrop struck
him. Mr. Campbell is a man who stands
fully six feet two inches high. In his
youth he must have been a powerful man
physically, for his frame is well propor
tioned and soundly knit. He walks, not
withstanding his rough treatment, with
agile firmness.
Speaking of the planter, Captain L:es
said : "He is one of the manliest and most
courageous of men that i ever met. He is
modest in his recital of what occurred. He
is not at all given to boasting or self praise.
"He simply tells what has happened and
tells it in a straightforward and intelli
gent style. He is a brave man and has
the courage of his convictions. He made
up his mind to die ratner than submit to
tl:e outrage. The robbers finding that
he would not yield dared not commit
murder.
"I first heard of this disappearance,"
said Captain Lees, "from Mr. Curtin,
whom I happened to meet at the Baldwin
Hotel last Monday evening. I told Cur
tin that the matter impressed me as im
portant, and so we kept a close watch of
the affair.
"At first Curtin was inclined to regard
Campbell's absence as a convivial inci
dent, but as we discussed the question a
more serious side was presented. We as
certained the identity of the two men, and
saw that one was showing up in daylight
and the other at night. We had the pur
pose in view to save Campbell before we
arrested his abductors. Last Wednesday
Winthrop could have been arrested, but
at that time we knew nothing of Camp
bell, and did not want to take any steps to
imperil the old man.
"You can rest assured, said Captain
Lees, "that all the stories about Mr.
Campbell being out on a lark and becom
ing dazed by wine and women are mere
surmises. He was lured out to that house
on California street, as he describes. Now
as a matter of fact 1 did not have time to
hear his story until to-day when he told it
to me in this room. Curtin, Campbell.my
self and one other went out Wednesday
night in a hack to locate the house. All
that Campbell could tell us was that the
scene was near the French Hospital.
"He also recollected distinctly that
there was a small palm tree to the left of
the yard as one entered the house from
the street. Two or three times I got out
of the hack to look for this palm.
"Finally we located the place, but
Campbell said, 'I did not come out here.'
Then we went around the house and
found the rear entrance leading to a back
street. This he recognized. We entered

the house and found everything as he de
scribed. The marks of the staples which
were driven in the floor were found.
Under the carpet we found the instrument
used for removing them. The whole story
was verified by the examination of the
premises. There is not a weak place in
the chain of Campbell's story."
Captain Lees and Detectives Seymour
and Cody visited the house at 4109 Califor
nia street last night, and after a minute
search of the premises, a bullet hole was
found in the wail of the back room a
couple of feet above the head of the bed.
The house was rented last Monday morn
ing by Oliver W. Winthrop, who claimed
he was renting it for a friend named Archi
bald. On Tuesday morning Winthrop was
seen on the premises, and there is no
doubt but that he is tbe nr an who first
made Campbell's acquaintance in San
Jose and subsequently took him from the
Occidental Hotel Monday afternoon.
Captain Lees is said to know where
Winthrop is aDd is expected to arrest him
in the morning.
Winthrop is the man who waÂ» arrested
a few years ago on a charge of having
murdered Mrs. Jennie Matthews in Laurel
Hill Cemetery. Although the evidence
was almost conclusive he was acquitted by
The indictment against Winthrop and
John Doe were filed in Judge Slack's court,
and on motion of District Attorney Hos
mer the papers were placed on the secret
file. Warrants were issued for the arrest
of the persons indicted.
The Grand Jury was so busily engaged
yesterday in considering the evidence
in the above case that no witnesses were
caMed in the illegal registration cases.
The Grand Jury, however, took up the
case of J. C. Green and Oppenheimer,
against whom charges were preferred by
Moses Gunst. After hearing Green's evi
dence aod examining contracts and docu
ments the Grand Jury ignored the charges.
P. B. Cornwall, for whom a subpena as
witness has been issued, has not returned
from the north. It is expected that he
will be in San Francisco early next week.
The Grand Jury adjourned yesterday un
til next Friday. At that time Mr. Corn
wall will probably attend and tell what he
knows concerniog the seven Supervisors
who were recently accused.
THE LABOR COUNCIL.
Kesolutions Passed Sympathizing With
Worden and Promising Support.
The San Francisco Labor Council at its
regular meeting last night, appointed a
committee of tive, consisting of C. A.
Hawkins, T. F. Burns, Ed. Rosenberg, W.
Macarthur and W. Ackerman, to take
such action as they deem proper on behalf
of the condemned striker, Worden, who
now is under sentence of death at Folsom
for the Sacramento tragedy.
The boycott on non-union brewers was
discussed and the action of the unions
was indorsed.
The question of opposing the new
charter was referred to a committee of
five to formulate a line of action in re
gard to this proposed law.
A resolution condemning the assault
made upon editor J. H. Barry by David
Neagle, and expressing tbe confidence of
the Labor Council in Barry's course in at
tacking tbe Southern Pacific corporation
was unanimously passed.
Pat Gould, an Eastern man, asked the
privilege of the Council to explain the
boycott on the Randall & Victor bicycle.
He was granted time for a short address,
in which he explained his side of the op
position. He was instructed to appear
before the trades unions and have tnosa
bodies continue their opposition to the
sale of the wheels in this City.
