UNION GENERALS
MEET THE MAJOR,
They Take Encouraging
Reports to McKinley
at Canton.
Silver Sentiment Recedes and
Everywhere Business Again
Reviving.
CONFIDENCE NOW RETURNING-
So Certain Are Thoughtful Men That
Republicans Will Win That
Prosperity Is Dawnmg.
CANTON, Ohio, Oct. 18.â When Major
McKinley looked out of his window this
morning he saw the first snow of tbe sea
son and later in the day he observed tnat
it was a fortunate thing the storm pre
vailed to-day instead of yesterday, when
there were nearly 25,000 strangers in the
city.
Major McKinley is beaming with good
health and pood humor to-day and ha?
thoroughly recovered from tbe fatigue in
cident to the arduous labors of Saturday.
He went to church this morning and the
veteran Union generals went him.
He walked home from church in the
whirling snow under an umbrella with
General Alger on one side and General O.
O. Howard on the other.
The train bearing the Union generals
arrived early this morning. On it were
General and Mrs. R. A. Alger, General
Sickles, General Thomas A. Stewart of
Pennsylvania, General 0. O. Howard,
General George A. Marden of Massachu
setts, Corporal James Tanner, Major J.W.
Burit of Illinois, Colonel G. O. Hopkins of
Detroit and Colonel I. N. Walker of
Indianapolis. The whole party dined
with Major McKinley tnis afternoon.
They leave for a trip through Eastern
Ohio in the morning, after holding a meet
ing here at 7:30 o'clock.
General Alger said this evening: "We
have had enormous meetings everywhere,
have visited 210 towns and traveled about
6000 miles. Major McKinley will be
elected and his popular vote will be snr
prisingly large."
Major McKinley has heard a great deal
of encouragine news to-day, and it does
not all come from politicians. E. O. Me-
Cormick, passenger traffic manager of tne
Bis Four system, is one of the most widely
acquainted business men in the Central
and border Southern States. He said to
day:
"I have talked with fully a hundred
â well-informed men, representing all shades
of political faith and thought, within the
week, and have been over a considerable
portion of the country. A great change
has taken place in public sentiment since
the first of September in Indiana, Illinois,
Michigan, Kentucky, lowa and Minne
soa. I have taken pains to discuss the
situation with many workingmen in many
places and I find the silver sentiment
everywhere declining with surprising
rapidity. The leeling that McKinley is
likely to win obtains in the business
world and the railroads are feeling the
evidence of returning confidence in very
considerably increased freight and pas
senger traffic."
A good many delegations will visit Can
ton this week.
Wednesday is Illinois day and Saturday
premises to be lively. Tne delegations
scheduled are as follows:
October 19â Sound-money Democrats
and Repub.icans of Minnesota; business

GENERAL GROSTESOR'S FIGURES
Sin rt'flcant Change* That Show Sle-
Hinlei/'s Certainty of Election.
ATHENS, Ohio, Oct. 18.â General
Grosvenor gave out a revised estimate of
the Presidential vote to-nieht. He said:
"There have been some significant
chang' s in the situation since my first
builetin and I have taken very great
pains, by the use of all available means,
to ascertain substantially what the result
is to be. There is yet some doubt and un
certainty about some of the States, but I
think the following may be safely placed
io the absolutely sure column. McKin
ley and HobaTt will have the following
States :
Knglind ..SB lowa 13
KewYork . ... 86 Minnesota. .....7 9
New Jersey.'-!!'. 10 South Dakota. ........ 4
.Maryland.. 8 North Dakota 3
Delaware 8 Wyoming - :-.
Pennsylvania 32 Nebraska 8
West Virginia........ â¢ 6 Kentucky- 13
0hi0...:... ........ 23 Oregon .4
Indiana^ ........ It Washington- ...'-â¢-*
111in0i5.......... ...... 24 California ..." 9
Michigan 14 â â
Wisconsin.. 12 ' otal .292
There are States which I do not class
as sure for McKinley whicn I believe will
* give him their vote, to-wit:
1 KanÂ«aÂ» lOiMlssouri 17
1 Virginia. 12 â -
\ Tennessee 62 Total 51
The States which do not seem to be
doubtful and which must be conceded
practically and without controversy to
Bryan remain as in my first table except
that Florida has disclosed an uncertainty
as to her status, and I think that Texas
and Louisiana may be added to the sure
The San Francisco Call
votes of Bryan. North Carolina is a
doubtful State with chances in favor of
Bryan, in my opinion.
Thus we have 292 votes for McKinley
and Hobart with 224 necessary to their
election. If they gain in the same ratio
for the next three weeks as they have
gained in the last three, this is a very
conservative estimate of the electoral
vote for them.
Wemt Virginia All Right.
PITTSBURGH Pa., Oct 18.-A special
to the Times from Kinewood, W. Va.,
says: William Dawson, chairman of the
Republican State Committee of West Vir
ginia, has given out a forecast of ttie com
ing election in this State. He says: "The
tide is still in our favor and the senti
ment for protection and sound money is
growing. Our majority will be anywhere
from 15,000 to 20,000. Our gains all over
the State will be general and particularly
large in the city of Wheeling aud Kana
wha County."
BY MAGNETIC ATTRACTION.
Scheme of a Boston Inventor by Which
Aerial Navigation May Become
a Possibility.
BOSTON, Mass., Oct. 18.â An entirely
new scheme looKing to aerial navigation
and flight has been suggested by A. W.
Nitsch of 1 Beacon street. It is such a de*
cided departure from all the propositions
heretofore advanced for utilizing the at
mosphere for purposes of transit as to
command serious attention from scient
ists and others to whom it has been pre
sented.
It is the idea of Mr. Nitsch that the
subtle magneiic attraction that holds the
needle of the mariner's compass with un
swerving fidelity to tbe north can be util
ized in a magnified form for man's con
venience, profit and pleasure. Accepting
tbe theory advanced that vast deposits of
magnetic ore exist in the immediate vicin
ity of the north pole and from there come
the magnetic curxents distributed over
the globe, and that it is the attraction of
this thus far unbounded field that draws
with magic power the needle of the com
pass, there is nothing, as Mr. Nitsch looks
at it, to prevent its being made of real
service.
"I believe," said he, "that magnets
could be suspended in the air of sufficient
force to counteract the resistance of the
air, overcome the adverse currents, and
move more or less rapidly toward the
north."
Mr. Nitsch said that it might not prove
possible, but it was open to argument and
experiment, and there is no telling what
might come of it As to the methods of
return, should such a flight as pictured
jver be taken, that was spoken of as a
problem that would be solved quickly.
RAILROADS OF RUSSIA.
Prince Michael Hi k off Says the Progress
Made in the Czar's Domain Will
Soon Astound the World.
NIAGARA FALLS, N. V.. Oct 18.â
Prince Michael Hilkoff, Imperial Minister
of Ways and Commerce of Russia, accom
panied by his snite, arrived here at 7
o'clock to-night on a special train over the
New York Central from New York, and
after an inspection of the Niagara Power
Company's plant viewed the falls by
moonlight. The Prince came expressly
to study American railway systems. Rus
sia, he declares, has made great strides in
railway building in recent years and will
astound the world when the work con
templated is completed. The railroads of
Russia are now operated upon the conti
nental system, but it is proposed to sub
stitute the American. When the great
trans-Siberian railway is completed
Prince Hiikuff declares Russia will have
made it possible to travel around the
world in the marvelous time of about
thirty days.
To-morrow the Prince and his party
will spend in viewing the falls and will
then go to Buffalo and later to Depew,
where the New York Central shops will
be inspected.
ROBBERS RAID CARNEY.
Daring Desperadoes Swoop Down
Upon a Town in
0k ah: ma.
" Dynamite Lick " and His Crowd
Commit a Bold Outrage and Gather
In Some Cash.
GUTHRIE, O. T., Oct. 18.â Two posses
of United States Marshals are in hot pur
suit of the bold desperadoes who held up
the little town of Carney, thirty miles east
of here, last night Two men supposed to
be members of the gang stopped at a
farmhouse this morning and demanded
food.
Their horses looked as though they had
been ridden a long way. Several deputies
immediately pursued them.
The story of the hold-up at Carney reads
like the robberies of the early days in
Oklahoma, It was 10 o'clock when the
town was attacke.l by the six bandits, all
heavily armed, masked and well mounted.
The robbers entered with a fl urish of
arms and oath*, and at once attacked the
r store of J. E. Foutz, the largest merchant
in the city. Before entering the town tbe
bandits cut the telephone wires between
Carney and Chandler, in order to prevent
interference with their apparently pre
arranged plans.
Carney is a town of 300 people. Only
Foutz and his Bon were in the store when
t c robbers rushed in and drew their guns
on them.
The chief of the outlaws demanded
Foutz to open his safe. He quickly com
plied and banded over $800 in cash to the
bandits. Two of the roobers then bound
and gagged Foutz and his son and carried
them two miies out of town. Meanwhile
the other robbers attacked the hotel and
Postoffice, but got nothing in the latter
place. In the hotel three drummers and
two citizens were robbed in all of $500 in
money, watches and jewelry.
At the United States Marshal's office
the opinion prevails that the gang is
headed by "Dynamite Dick," pal of the
late Dalton ana Doolin. He was said to
be in Missouri nearSedaiia last week. The
robters had their plans well laid, which
accounts for their liberty thua far.

MADRID, Spain, Oct. 18.â The Imparcial
says that Spain should demand from the
United States an explanation of the dis
patch from Washington published by the
New York Herald to the effect that unless
Spain ends the war in Cuba before Jan
nary 1 President Cleveland will recognize
the independence of the insurgents.
The Imparcial adds that the neutrality
observed at the ;<orts of the United States
is an odious fiction, and t at there is a
continual conniving at filibustering. It
says the United States Consul-Gfinnral at
Havana protected a Spanish deserter at
Havana, and conclude?:
"If Spain should remain alone in a con
flict with the United States Spaniards by
their own efforts will know how to mark
the difference between the noble defenders
of their own pioperty and the vile traffick
ers at Washington."
LONDON, Eno., Oct. 18.â A dispatch to
the Central News from Madrid says the
King, Queen Regent and other members
of the court returned to the capital to-day
from San Sebastian, where they bad been
spending the summer. The dispatch adds
that an attempt was made to wreck the
royal train by some one, presumably a
Cuban. A dynamite bomb had been
placed on the rails, but fortunately it was
discovered before the train reached the
place.
NEW YORK. N. V., Oct 18.â A special
dispatch to the Herald from Havana,
Cuba, says:
This morning's reports indicate that
while Captain-General Wevler's attention
is centered in Maceo's movements in the
west, Gomez's advance columns under
Mayia Rodriguez, Rabi, Quintin Bandera
and Pancho Carrillo, are laughing at the
central trocha, have swept across Santa
Clara Province without meeting serious
opposition, and invaded Matanzas with
from 5000 to 7000 fresh recruits from the
Orient.
Rodriguez is now encamped north of
Alfonso XII, near the line of Havana
province. Aguirre is reported to be
marching with a strong force irom Janico
to greet and conduct him westward
through Southern Havana, their sup
posed plan being to attack the western
trocha south of Artemiua before the Span
ish General, Gonzalez Munoz, can engage
Maceo at Cacara Cara.
Calixto Garcia and Avelino Rosa, with
rebel corps, are said to be now menacing
Puerto Principe City, moving west from
Cascorro by irregular marches toward
Ciego de Avita.
The Herald's correspondent at Ciego de
Avila reports that a party of 400 in
surgents crossed the central trocha near
Jama on the morning of the 8:h, under a
sharp tire from the Spanish forts. The
reoels moved rapidly westward.
It is belie red that Rabi' a rear column is
following up the invasion in Santa Clara
simultaneously with Mayia Rodriguez's
entry into Matanzas province.
The party crossing at Jagua did not lose
a man. They made no response to the
Spanish fire, treating it with contempt.
A filibustering expedition composed of
twenty-Ove men, arms and ammunition,
is reported to have disembarked ou the
night of October 14, on tbe coast near
Puma del Indio, between Havana and
â¢â¢'laruco. Tho 'ead<>r w<w unknown. It i<Â«

Mr. Terrell, the American Minister, has
not, however, applied for permission for

should be granted to tbe United Stales
the smaller nations would follow her ex
ample and also ask for guards*. ips.
The Daily News will tomorrow publish

CRASHED DOWN
FROM A TOWER
Fall of a Five Hundred
Pound Clock Weight
Into a Church.
Those in the Edifice Startled by
the Breaking ot t c
Timbers.
THEN A PAKIC SOON FOLLOWS.
But the Congregation Escapes Injury
and the Priests Quiet
All Fears.
MILWj* UKEE. Wis., Oct. 18.â A 500
--pound clock weight crashed through
three floors of St. Hedwig's Catholic
Church this afternoon. The church was
crowded at the time and a panic ensued,
in which no one was injured.
St. Hedwig's is a Polish Roman Catholic
church. Archbishop Katzer was admin
istering the sacrament of confirmation to
a class of 225 at the time and the church
was crowded. There were over 2000 peo
ple present.
The tower is 180 feet high and the
weight was suspended at a height of 170
feet. The tower covers the entrance to
the edifice. The services had been in
progress for some time, and fortunately
there were no people passing in or out.
At a few minutes after 4 o'clock the ser
vices were brought to an end by a terrible
crash in the belfry. It seemed to those in
tbe church that the tower was falling.
The first crash was followed by a second
in an instant, then came a third. The
big weight had fallen through the three
floors and into the entry.
It had happened so quickly that the
congregation could barely gasp for breath
after the first floor gave way under the
weight, when it was over, and the"peopie
beean to pour in disorder from the church.
Women screamed aud men turned pale
with fright.
The priests, realizing the danger, called
on the people to preserve order and to
leave the church quietly. They were soon
assured by those near the door that danger
was past. They quieted down and the
building was emptied without serious ac
cident. _______________

An Unmasking of Rascality That
Caused the Flight of W. T.
Rambusch
FOHQED REALTY MORTGAGES.
Through an Incendiary Fire He Ob
tained Control cf the R cords
of Dolge County, Wis.
JUNEAU, Wis.. Oct. 18.â No trace oi
W. T. Rambuseu, the defaulting banker
and real estate man who has been missing
for ten days, beyond the intelligence con
veyed in a letter from ibe East that he
was in Philadelphia, has reached this city.
Inquiring investors who trusted him
implicitly have crowded the town during
the week, but only additional proofs of
Rambus(.:h's rascality have rewarded their
search for available assets. Yesterday a
small bottle of a clear fluid in which rest
ei a little sponge waa found. Tim, on
beine submitted to a chemist's test,
proves to be an erasing fluid, and by its
use Rambusch had manipulated deeds
and records at will.
The defalcations already bror^ht to
light reach the sum of $250,000 and those
engaged in the work of straightening the
books cairn the end is not yet. The only
assets thus far discovered amount to $25,
---000 and consist of the records of Mr. Ram
busch's office, worth about $10.0)0, stock
in the Citizens' Bank to the value of $7500,
a few notes of d Ã¼btful value and a piece
of mortgaged real estate.
The principal losses are sustained by
the following: George Hawkins, Water
town, $70,000; Mrs. L. Winfieid Spence,
Fon dv Lac, $26,000; Nelson estate, $20,
---000; P. C. Quentmeyer, Watertown. $8000;
Mrs. Jeannette Howelis, Milwaukee,
$8000; D. H. B*men, $8000; Silas Coleman,
Fon <iv Lac, $5000; J. J. Williams, Baaver
Dam, $5000; W. A. Bert, $5000; mortgages
for small amounts to the Register of
Deeds, most of which are fraudulent,
$35,000.
Ram busch's operations extend over a
period of twenty years. He n\nÂ«; in that
time have handled betwaeivjÂ£ 000,000 and
$3,000,000 in tne work of buying and ex
cnauging mortgages. How much he re
ceived from his clients or how much he
paid them cannot be determined. He left
no account books wonhy of the name.
What he did leave do not extend over the
whole period that he has been in business
and do not show in more than a few in
stances of his hnving received money for
mortgages. They do show that he has
paid large sums toi interest on mortgages.
He handled thousands of mortgages, as
he was the trusted financial agent of a
number of wealthy investors. The only
way his defalcations can be found out is
for all those who hold Dodge County
mortgages to send them to Juneau to
have them looked up, and for all those
who own property in tho county to ex
amine and determine whether it has been
affected by his fictitious mortgages or
deeds.
Rambusch, owning the only complete
abstract record in the county, had the key
to the situation. The manner in which
he was caught well illustrates his pe
culiar method of dealing. One ol
Ranibusch's most faithful and profit'
able clients was Mrs. Laura Win
field Spence of Fon dv Lac. Mrs.
Spence is married the second time.
Her first husband was a Mr. Winfieid, 3
banker and a friend and companion ol
Rambusch. He invested thr ugh the
latter, and his wife, after his death, con
tinued the practice.
Mr. Spence, however, was not of the conÂ«
fiding nature of his wife. His suspicioni
were aroused early in the summer, when
in looking over his wife's securities he
noticed what uniformly clean abstract*
were furnished by Rambusch. They werÂ«
all in the latter's handwriting. They were
all -short. Few of them showed that th<
farms had been incumbered many timei
since the Government gave its patent to
the first settler. This was a strange cir
cumstance, as Mr. Spence knew from ex
perience that, the pioneers were poor, and
that it is the usual thing for farmers tÂ«
mortgage their land. It also appeared
strange to him that most of themortgagei
were given on land owned by widowers oi
unmarried, and contained but one signa
ture. On October Bhe came here to learn
if the taxes were paid on all of the land
on which his wife had advanced money
Mr. Rambusch was out of. the city and hi
began an investigation on his own ao
count. In looking over the register o,
deeds record he found a mortgage froa
John Rohde to Laura W. Spence for $500
He aid not remember the document, but
knew there was a mortgage against Johi
Rohde for $2500.
He at once went to Rambusch's offlc<
and looked up the original abstract. P
was all right. Up to the last transfer then
had been no transfer to Joan Rohde. Hi
left a note for Rambusch saying he wanie<
to see him at Beaver Dam on Saturday t<
have some matters explained. Rambuscl
did not come. Spence found there was in
such person as John Rnhrie, and tha

Rambuach had not only executed a ficti
tious mortgage, but he had, after record
ing it, raised the amount to $2500. â 
Rambusch was frightened at Spence's
note and drawing $500 from the bank left
town. Mrs. Spence placed an attachment
on all of his property the next day and
he whole story of his transactions began to
* unfold itself.
The confession of Rambusch, which
came in the form of a letter for his wife,
is far from complete. The family refuse
to make the letter, public, although the
authorities have been allowed to read it.
It tells nothing of what he did .with the
money. He says that for twenty years his
life has been a lie.
Ho has led a dual existence, and that
life had at last become unbearable, and
when his wife received the letter he
would be dead. He claimed his income
from his office was not sufficient to keep
up his house in the way in which he
wanted to run it. He said that be had
not used any of the money in gambling or
speculation, or had not, as might be
charged, spent it for pleasure or de
bauchery. The letter was dated at Colon
nade Hotel, Philadelphia.
Twenty years ago Rambusch was en
gased in the real estate business in part
nership with Richard Mertz. They pur
chased the abstract office of Judge Lewis,
and he was pushing them hard for pay
ment. In October, 1877, a small brick
building, in which were the county offices
and all of the real estate records, burned.
It was charged at the time that the tire
was started to destroy the evidence
against Ode Traynor, who was County
Treasurer, and who was alleged to b?
short in his accounts. Traynor was tried
and acquitted. At the time tbe District
Attorney suspected Rambusch of being
the incendiary, and had collected some |
evidence against him, but not enough to j
warrant prosecution.
The next morning after the fire Ram- j
bu*ch borrowed enough money to pay |
Judge Lewis and to secure the abstracts. '
The fire which destroyed the county
records made Rambuscb. The records,
which he bousrht for $3000, were then val
ued at about $25,000. Dodge County could
not then afford to have new records writ
ten. Rambusch was the only one who
could furnish a complete abstract of title
to its lands, and he secured from the
county a contract by which he was to fur
nish it for twenty years all of its abstracts. j
This contract still has two years to run. \
It placed every investor who put money
into Dodge County lands absolutely at
the mercy of one man.
It is thought he began his fraudulent
work in 1876. All the time he was a good j
church member. An Episcopalian, he |
went to the" Presbyterian church because
his denomination had no church here.
He cared for the collections of the church.

CAUSE OF HIGH WHEAT PRICES.
Dry Weather Shortens the Crop Abroad and
Increases the Demand on the
United States.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Oct. 18.â The
Agricultural Department, from the .Octo
ber returns manes the following report:
Crop conditions â A feature of tiie present
outlook, encouraging to the producer, is
the prospective shortage of the European
crop.
In Germany, a heavy producer of pota
toes, not more than half a crop is likely,
and with beaw shortages in other States
an increased demand for export trade will
probably arise. A general decline in con
dition of sugar cane is shown. In Louisi
ana, the chief producing State, only about
half a crop is indicated, and less than
that in Texas and Arkansas, while the
condition in Georgia is far below the
normal.
Dry weather is cited as the cause of the
shortage. There is a decided failing off
in condition of rice from 76.50 to 68.6.
The drouzht ha 3 been the principal cause
of low condition. Of the wheat market in
Great Britain the European agent of the
department writes:
Great Britain is the principal outlet of
the superfluous wheat of the world, and
her markets during the past month have
presented a study of peculiar interest ana
value. It was known at the opening of
the month that the Russian and Ameri
can crops were short.
There was practically nothing available
from otuer exporting countries, except a
few cargoes of last season's wheat from
Argentina, and stocks were lower both in
Great Britain and on the Continent. The
Russians declined to sell, except at en
hanced prices, and their shipments fell
far behind the usual average for the time
of year. The only source of supply wad
the United States, and it might naturally
have been expected we would reap the
benefit of the situation by obtaining en
hanced prices.
Our financial position appears, however,
to have precluded our taking full advan
tage of the situation, and our new wheat
came forward in great quantities. The
month ends with an improvement of 6 to
7 cents a bushel, but it is the general
opinion of the members of the grain trade
in London and Liverpool that the advance
might hare been doubled and brought
about earlier had the United States been
in a position to hold back wheat. It is
certain that the harvest of the current
year will see no surpluses, and it is rea
sonable to suppose that, we shall see no
further reduction of wheat areas, such as
have been observable in the records of the
st few years.
STONES THROWN BY A MOB.
Missilea Intended for a Negro Assailant
Seriously Wound Passengers on
a Train.
WESTCHESTER, Pa., Oct. 18.âEd
ward Brown, the negro who attacked Mrs.
Thomas Johnson in a suburb of Coatsville
night before last, was landed in jail at this
place at 1:30 o'clock thiÂ§ morning. When
the officer took the culprit to the railway
station a mob surrounded him and it was
with the greatest difficulty that he suc
ceeded in placing the scared negro safely
on board the cars. Before the train started
stones were hurled through the car win
dows thick and fast and the passengers be
came terror-stricken and rushed in all
direction to escape the flying missile?.
One man, a passenger from the West,
was struck on the head by a stone and the
whole side of his face was laid open, while
a number of others received slight cuts
and bruises about the bead and body.

BRYAN BREAKS
A SUNDAY RULE
To Oblige Colonel Butler
the Nebrakan Talks to
Newsboys.
Pretty Sentences That May En
courage Little Fellows in
Lile's Battle.
"WE WERE ALL BOYS ONCE."
Those Who Begin the Struggle for
Bread at an Eariy Age Have
an Advantage.
DETROIT, Mien., Oct. 18.â The rule
established by William J. Bryan to avoid
any public addresses on Sunday was bro
ken to-night, when he spoke briefly to a
crowd of newsboys at the Newsboys' Hall.
He did it to oblige his friend and sup
porter, Colonel I. G. Butler, president of
tiie Newsboys' Association. At Mr.
Bryan's request the affair was kept very
quiet, and outside of the little venders a
lew visitors only were uresent. In the be
lief that Mr. Bryan could not cams Colonel
Butler dismissed the boys shortly after 9
o'ci ck. Nearly all were out of the hall
when Mr. Bryan made his appearance.
They scrambled back to theii places and
heard this little speech from the candi
date:
Boys, I aid not come to make a speech to
night, because this is tUe any that I rest and I
have felt the need of having a day of rest more
recently than ever before. But I came because
I never like to decline an invitation to be
present at any place where an endeavor is
being made to do good. And 1 don't know of
any work which is better than that work which
is done for boys. We were all boys onceâ and
some of us not so very long ago â and when I
see boys I am reminded of what one of our
Presidents, 1 think it was Garfield, saidâ that
you could not tell what possibilities were
buttoned up under the vest of a boy. When 1
think oi the possibilities that lie before a boy
in a country uke this, I can appreciate any
movement which has for its object the bettering
of the condition of boys or giving to them
higher ideas In life and the making of better
men.
Now, we are not ourselves responsible for the
surroundings of youth. We are born into this
world and the surroundings meet us and to a
certain extent they affect us. But beyond
that we have much to do wiih shaping our
own course. What we amount to in this world
depends upon the ideas wnich we have. Some
one has said that a person who aims at the
stars wili shoot higher, which simply means
that, those who have the highest purposes will
accomplish mosi. A meeting of this kind,
where they te&ch you patriotism, where they
teach you regard for tach other, respect ior
each other's rights, necessarily elevates your
ideas, gives you broader views of life, and
tli 'so views wili help you to accomplish more.
Now, iv this country in whieii we live boys
are more blessod th*n in any other country
on earth, dccauso the boy In this country has
everything opeu to him, and the boy in this
coumry may accomplish more than he can in
pny other country. I am here simply to tes
tify by my presence more than by my words
to the interest that I feel lv organizations
such as this, 1 care not under what auspices
they are conducted. No good effort is ever
lust, and if a kind word spoken to a boy, a
kind hand given to a boy. Rives him hope,
makes nim desire belter tnuigs, starts him on
un v; ward course, there i.s no measuring the
influence that that kind word or kind act
has. There is a soug thai they sing In Sunday
sc.ool, "Kind worus can never die; kind
deeas can never die."
Now 'there are many times when a human
life, or many human lives, wili depend upon
<.he action oi one person; there are times when
the welfare oi the community will depend
on one person; there are times when the wel
fare o the Nation will depend upon one per
son, aud when you remember how influential
one person may become in the destinies of the
Nation, how usefui be may be to his feliow, to
society, you can see that if a kind word or
act should be the cause of getting that boy
started right, leading him up to take advan
tage of his opportunities, what results may
follow.
I want you to remember that no good ever
comes to boys or men from doing wrong and
that right always pays. I know it is hard al
ways to believe, but if you take % broad view
of life and its possibilities, you will find that
it always pays to do what you believe is right.
It is always necessary that you should try to
find out what right is, and the education
which you receive in the scuoois enables you
to see things and understand things, and then
the desire to do the best thing leads you to
take advantage of the opportunities that are
offered to you. I notice the mottoes on the
wail and mottoes from the National songs. 1
want you to grow into larger boys and into
men, appreciating the advantages which your
country affords, and then that each one of you
anal, btive the ambition to make the most out
oi those advantages, because you know if ad
vantages come to persons and they ao not use
them, advantages migm jatt as well not have
come, aud if a person de-ires to use advantages
aud they do not come, then he is helple.-s. but
if in acouutry like this you have tne advan
tages and then mate the best of the oppor
tunities you can see the highest form of citi
zenship.
I feel interest in you boys who are starting
out so young to make a living. Some of us,
iiisiead of uaving to depend on our own exer
tions, weie carried forward by others. 1 am
not sure that you who begin this liie of inde
pendence and of necessary activity so eariy,
uave an advantage over us who did not; but
whether you had the advantage or not, If you
improve every opportunity that comes and let
your motto be, treat every one aÂ« you would
have that person treat you, and to make the
beat opportunity of everything that ccmes
within your reach and to do nothing that
your conscience will condemn you for, when
you get to be old men, you will be able to look
back and be grateful to colonel Butler and to
those who are associated with him in thin ef
fort to give you high laeas, and to give you
words of encouragement in the years of your
youth ; and umess iam mistaken the o.der you
grow the deeper will be your feeling of grati
tude toward those who gave you this kindly
assistance when you were boys.
I want you to remember this, also: That you
are not toe only ones who are benefited by
these things, tecause the Creator has so ar
ranged the things oi this world that when we
try to help others we help ourselves. Tnose
wno have tried to help you, those who have
tried to do you good, find that they themaelves
are benefited by the operation. While tuey
are trying to make your lives happy their own
lives are made happier, if I can leave this
idea with you I think that it may be of use to
you: 'lhat the highest good that can come to
you is from serviceâ from doing something for
others, and you will find among your play
mates that the boy who does most for the boys
around him in the boy who is liked best ana
is the boy who enjoys himself most. When
you come to te a man, no matter how old you
get, you will find that the more good you do to
others the more enjoyment you will get out
of life yourselves; so that your meeting here
with those whu are in charge of the organiza
tion is of double value. It blesses you and It
helps them and 1 am glad thut you appreciate
their efforts and that you enjoy what they are
trying to do for you.

CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 18.â It was defi
nitely decided to-day that Generals Palmer
and Buckner, who will arrive at noon to

Omaha. In that city -they will speak
under the auspices of the State committee
of Nebraska, and if the committee deems
it advisable the candidates will make a

With only two weeks of active cam
paign left 'the officers of the National
Democratic Commit tee are more than ever
satisfied that Palmer and Buckner are go
ing to receive their full bbare of votes in
in every State where the gold Democrats
have organized. Advices from National
comnutteemen and from the chairman 6i
the State committee received by Vice-
Chairman Hopkins during the past lour
or five days indicate that the sentiment of
sound-money Democrats in favor of
Palmer and Buckner has been crowing at
a phenomenal rate, and that thousands of
Democrats who had originally intended to
cast their votes for McKinley are taking
refuge under the standard of the Indian
apolis convention. Vice-Chairman Hop
kins does not deem it advisable at this
time to give out any figures relative to
the probable vote for the ticket, because
he inclines to the bt-lief that the present
estimates are too low. He believes that
during the two weeks intervening before
election day a radical change will take
place and that more than 90 per cent of
the sound-money Democrats ot the Na
tion will yoie for the candidates of the
Indianapolis convention.
STORY TOLD BY STATISTICS
Interesting Circular by Professor
Hyde Issued by the Agricul
tural Department.
When the Ratio of Silver Was the
Lowest So Were the Prices Re
ceived for Wheat.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Oct. 18.â The
Agricultural Department will to-morrow
issue a pamphlet on the subject of wneat
prices by Professor John Hyde of the Sta
tistical Department. There is no attempt
at concealment of the fact that the sub
ject matter of the circular has been con
sidered along with the money question
and made part and parcel of it.
The statistics cover a period of twenty
eight years, ending June 30, 1895. during
which time the United States exported
more than 2,000,000,000 bushels of wheat
and 216,162,122 barrels of flour, equivalent
in the aggregate to more than 3,000.000,000
bushels ot grain. For those exports were
received more than $3,000,000,000 "m gold
or its equivalent."
The circular says the expression "in
goid" is used because from the beginning
of the period under consideration down
to the end of 1878, the prices of all com
modities was computed in currency that
was continually fluctuating in value. The
circular says:
Before the prices of American products at
any time from 1862 to 1878 can be compared
with the prices of similar articles la other
countries or m other times, they have to be
reduced to their value in the money of com
merce.
The statistics with resnect to wheat
from|lÃ67tolÃ9saregruoped into five terms
of five year^ each and one of three. For
these period? it is found that from July 1,
1867, to June 30, 187J, the average pric-'per
bushel for wheat wa^ $1.1696; from 1872 to
1877, $1-1414; from 1877 to 1882, $1.1934;
from 1882 to 1887, $1.0266; from 1837 Â»o
1892, $0,992: from 1892 to 1895, $0.7487.
Upon these figures the circular says;
The most noteworthy feature of this table,
next to its stupendous aggregates, is the fact
that it was not during the five years immedi
ately preceding 1873, but from 1877 to 1882,
that wa received the highest average price per
bushel. During that period our exports were
larger than at any other time under consider
tion.
After citing the comparatively high
prices that prevailed through almost the
first half of 1868, the circular calls atten
tion to the fact that while the wheat
grower does not forget this, he does not
so readily remember; neither is he so fre
quently reminded that before the end of
the year 1869 wheat was worth much less.
No. 1 was equivalent to 63 and No. 2 to 72
cents in gold per bushel and this when
silver was worth $1,325 per ounce, or 15 6
to 1. This period of low prices lasted
about eight months and was brought to
an end, not by any change in the value of
silver nor by any legislation affecting the
currency, but simply by the breaking out
of war between France and Germany.
After discussing the question of supply
&nd demand and making reference to the
new wheat-growing countries that have
been opened up, causing a reduction in
the price of wheat, the circular concludes:
In the face of such facts as the f oreeoing it
would surely be ridiculous to discuss seriously
the contention that it U the fall in the price
of silver that has caused the fall in the price
of wheat. From 1873 to 1882 silver fell more
than 18 cents an ounce, or 14 per cent, and
wheat advanced about 2% cents per bushel, or
2m'rc?nt. During the last ninety days silver
has fallen 4 Cents an ounce, and wheat, owing
to deficient harvests in other countries, has
advanced from 64 to 78 cents per bushel.

The estimate for fortifications and sea
coast defenses has been increased to $15,
--825,827. In this connection Secretary La
mont makes a statement of the condition
of this work, the advances that have been
made and the results that can be secured
by the increased appropriation which he
asks. This shows that on Ist of July.
1889, but one modern gun had been placed
in position. On the Ist of July, 1897,
there will have been completed defenses
with armament as follows: Thirteen
12-inch guns, thirty-seven 10-inch, eight
8-inch and four rapid-fire guns and eighty
12-inch mortars. Of these, seven 12-inch,
nineteen 10-inch, fifteen 8-inch, four
rapid-fire and thirty-two 12-inch mortar
implacements are to be constructed under
contract, while the remaining ones are
now being built by the engineer depart
ment with hired labor.

dition of the coast defenses after the ex
penditures authorized by the act of June
16, 1894, implacements with guns and
mortars that should be in position:

provide the following:
Gunsâ One 16 inch gun (finishing and

SATOLLI SAILS FOR NAPLES.
Numbers of Catholic Churchmen Assemble
ar New York to Bid the Distinguished
Prelate Farewell.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 18.â Cardinal
Satolli, until recently Papal Delegate to
this country, sailed yesterday morning for
Naples on the North German Lloyd
steamer Kaiser Wilhelm 11, which left her
dock in Hoboken at 10 o'clock. He was
accompanied by Father Bianco, his tem
porary secretary. Father Gamboni of
Louisville, Ky., wa3 a fellow-passenger.
When he reached the North German
Lloyd line pier he found awaiting him
Archbishops Corrigan, Martinelli and
Chappelle, Mgr. Sbarretti, Dr. RooKer,
secretary to the Papal legation in Wash
ington, and Father Connelly, secretary to
Archbishop Corrigan. Tne party boarded
the vessel at once and went to the cap
tain's cabin, which was crowded until sail
ing time with clergymen and prominent
laymen who had come to bid farewell to
the distinguished prelate. Among those
who called were Archbishops Ireland and
Riordan, Bishops McGoldrick, Gabritls,
Farley, McDonnell and McNamara.
Brother Justin, president of tne Man
hattan College, had chartered the excur
sion steamer Valley Girl to accompany
the Kai3er Wilhelm down the bay. The
little steamer was crowded with passen
gers, the majority of whom were clergy
men.
When the whistle sounded the crowd
began to hasten from the steamship decks
and Archbishop Corrigan and Archbishop
Ireland met face to face. They shook
hands cordially and chatted together for a
few moments.
There was great cheering from the
steamboat when the big ocean liner pulled
into the stream and turned her nose to
ward the bay. The excursion boat quickly
took her position on the port side. There
she remained the entire distance of her
trip. But few of the Kaiser Wilhelm's
passengers were on deck and there was no
sign of Cardinal Satolli. II seems that he
was unaware of the near presence of such
a number of loyal admirers, and on bid
ding farewell to the crowd in the cap
tain's cabin supposed he had seen the
last of his American friends, for a time at
least.
The crowd on the Valley Girl cheered a
man on the Wilhelm whom they supposed
to be the Cardinal, but it proved to
be Father Gamboni. He quickly real
ized the situation and started for the
cabin. Then the cheering began again
while the band played "Just Tell Them
That You Saw Me." i Pretty soon Father
Gam boni returned with the Cardinal and
Father Bianco. i Then 'â  pandemonium
reigned.
Every one on the steamboat yelled him
self hoarse, three \ cheers were called for
and giyen again and again. The band
changed its tune to "Anld Lang Syne."
The Cardinal appeared immensely pleased.
He leaned over the rail between, the. two
other clergymen and bowed and smiled
and waved his hat. -_ ;,- ?. J V\ ; t - ; --- *â¢ I

ARRIVES SAFE AT SOUTHAMPTON.
Voyage of the American Liner Paris Across
the At/antic With One Engine
Disabled.
SOUTHAMPTON, Oct. 18.â The Ameri
can Line steamer Paris, Captain Watkins,
from New York, before reported as Dro
ceed ng with her starboard engine dis
abled, arrived here this morning. To a
representative of the United Asso
ciated Presses Captain Watkins said
that on the morning of October
8 the starboard shaft broke in the
tube about fifty feet from the propeller.
The vessel was at once stopped, and after
an examination it was decided to proceed
for Southampton under the port engine.
The Paris was then 353 miles from New
York. In the afternoon of the same day
the White Star Line steamer Teutonic,
bound eastward, passed the Paris. Later
the Hamburg-American Line steamer
Fuerst Bismarck, bound for New York,
sighted the Paris and went alongside of
her. The Fuerst Bismarck offered to take
the Paris in tow, but the offer was de
clined.
During the trio the Paris spoke twenty
other vessels. She completed her passa ,-c
under her port screw, averaging twelve
and a half knots per hour, and she cov
ered the course without a bitch.

AGAINST CATOR
Populists of California Are
Moving for the Boss'
Overthrow.
Concerted Onslaught to This End
Will Be Made Over the
State To-Day.
SCORE HIM AS A RENEGADE.
Middle-of-the-Roadsters Refuse to Be
Longer Considered as His
Chattels.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Oct. 18.â One of
the most determined fights ever made
against the aspirations of a renegade poli
tician and perennial office-seeker will open
all over this State to-morrow. It is the
Btrusgle against the selfish ambition of
Thomas V. Cator, late of New Jersey and
a former Republican, Democrat, Nation
alist and Populist in turn, for revenue
' only or the spoils of office. This right will
be made upon Cator by the Populists
themselves, who know him most inti
mately and who have the best of reasons
for distrusting him. The people who will
lead in the contest are the bone and sinew
of the Populist party in this State. These
Bturdy fathers of the party in California
say they do not propose to sit idly by
while their principles are spurned and the
offices peddled out by Cator and Wardall
for selfish ends.
Correspondence has been carried on
among the opponents of Cator and War
dall for weeHs and a plan for concerted ac
tion against them has been agreed upon.
This will include an expose of Cator's
New Jersey record, which James G. Ma
guire first gave to the people of California
in a speech delivered at Metropolitan
Temple, San Francisco, in the autumn of
1892. Next will follow the exposure of
Cator and Wardall's packing of the late
State convention of Populists and their
rushing throusrh under gag rule a resolu
tion indorsing the former for the United
States Senate. This bit of fine work, as is
well known among the leading Populists
of the State, was accomplished by the
barter-and-trade element of the party and
in opposition to the will of the ablest and
best men of the party all over California.
Chairman Wardall of the State Central
Committee will share the odium of Cator
in this job.
After this the combine and conspiracy
between Cator and Senator White to
dominate two sessions of the California
Legislature for their own purpose will be
exposed. The middle-of-the- roadsters will
see to it that Populistic and Democratic
candidates for the btate Senate and As
sembly are thoroughly inJormed regard
ing the mercenary motives of these gen
tlemen. Cator and White will both be
put on the del endive, and it is confidently
predicted here that neither of these gen
tlemen will ever seriously disturb the poli
tics of California after this campaign is
ended, for the inevitable defeat of Cator at
the coming session of the Legislature
means the permanent retirement of White
two years hence.
The plans have been deliberately made,
the die is cast and the concentrated on
slaught will be begun at once. Cator, the
renegade, is to be retired forever in Cali
fornia.
BIG RALLY AT SUISUN.
George A. Knight of San Francisco the
Speaker â Parade of Flam
beau Clubs.
SUISUN DEPOT, Cal.. Oct. 18.â One of
the largest and most enthusiastic political
demonstrations ever held in Suisun was
that of last evening. Hon. George A.
Knight of San Francisco was tbe principal
speaker. People came from every town
in Solano County to hear his address. He
was met at the depot by the Suisun Mc-
Kinley and Hobart Club. A line of march
was formed, the local brass band heading
the torchlight procession. The speaker
and the county candidates were escorted
to the Arlington Hotel, where they dined.
While Mr. Knight and party were at the
hotel the procession continued to march
to Fairtield, where the Cordelia McKinley
Club, 100 strong, with the brass band from
that town, was met. The Fairfield Repub
licans formed in line and marched back
to Suisun.
The meeting in Native Sons' Hall was
called to order by Attorney O. R. Cogh
lan, president of the Suisun McKinley
Club, who briefly addressed the audience.
Following a song by the Benicia male
quartet, the Republican nominees, J. J.
Luchsinger of Vallejo and Alden Ander
son, for State Senator and Assemblyman
respectively, made short speeches. Then
the chairman in a eulogistic speech intro
.iuced Mr. Knight.
The eloquent orator kept the audience
spellbound for three hours, never tiring
his listeners. Although the large hall was
packed almost to suffocation exception
ally good order prevailed to the end. Fol
lowing Mr. Knight' 3 speech Rev. Anna H.
Shaw spoke in the interest of woman suf
frage.
Conspicuous amone those who served as
vice-presidents was H. C. Bronson of Sui
sun Valley, w: o. some time ago, had an
nounced himself as a Bryan map. Mr.
Bronson, who has farmed here for up
ward of forty years, had been a lifelong
Republican, and when it was found that
the Democrats had grounds for ciaimmg
him as a member of their ranks great was
the surprise. Although the gentleman
possesses more than the average intelli
gence, like many other Republicans who
at first were deceived by the supposed ad
vantages of free coinage, he left the old
party. The recent decline in the market
value of silver and the rapid ris-e in the
price of wheat, refuting one of Bryan's
principal contentions, brought him back.
DEBATE AT MADERA.
Prank H. Short and J. W. Mitchell Argue
on Political Issues.
MADERA, Cal,, Oct. 18.â Frank H.
Short was some time ago announced to
speak here yesterday on behalf of the Re
publicans. Later J. W. Mitchell of Los
Angeles was announced to speak on be
half of the Democrats and Populists. The
only sufficiently large hall in town was
rented by the Republicans and Mr. Mitch
<ell was apparently to be compelled to
s^eak outside. When it was suggested
that a joint iiiscus3ion be held in the hall
&t. Short readily consented to divide the
time with Mr. Mitchell. Last night tbe
nail was packed to the doors and many
could not gain admission.
Mr. Short opened tor forty-five minutes
with a strong and vigorous speech for pro
tection. He reviewed the utter failure
and incapacity of the Democratic party,
as proved by experience, and paid special
attention to the necessities of California
and the benefits of protection. In his re
ply Mr. Mitchell talked for silver exclu
sively, referring repeatedly to Republican
authority to sustain his free-coinage argu
ments. But he did not attempt to" defend
free trade or the results of the past admin
istration. Mr. Snort closed in an effective
review of thirty minutes and appealed to
the reason, experience and judgment of
his audience.
The silver sentiment here was very
strong early in the campaign, but the
issue of protection is the most prominent
now and many Democrats will vote for
McKinly,
SANTA CRUZ ENTHUSIASM

peerless organization, and both sides of
Pacific avenue were crowded with an en
thusiastic concourse. Thr^e times three
cheers were given for McKinley and Ho
bart, with the war whoop of the Alliance,
and the procession moved toward the
depot. Two stops were made, one oppo
site the Call building to give three ring
ing cheers for The Call, and the other at
Major McLaughlin's residence, where the
boys of the Alliance awoke the echoes of
Beach Hill with their cheers for the gal
lant major.
TACOMA DEMOCRATS BOLT.
Important Accessions to the Republican
Party* Ranks.
TACOMA, Wash., Oct. 18.â Republican
ranks in this city have been swelled by
many bolting Democrats, but several ac
cessions more important than most of the
others have just been announced. Two
of them are Lake McGrath, blacksmith,
and William Watson, flourmill owner,
whose terras as councilmen recently ex
pired. Both were elected as Populists and
for Several years have been regarded as
leaders. Both declare they cannot sup
port Bryan and the Chicago platform and
are urging their friends to vote the entire
Republican ticket.
Watson's partner, ex-City Treasurer
Olds, a strong Democrat, is supporting
McKinley, as are also Watson's sons, Old's
son and a majority of ther mill employes.
In an interview published to-day Post
master A. B. Case, a lifelong Democrat
and the present commander of the Wash
ington Commandery of the Loyal Legion,
repudiates poj ocracy and urges his many
friends throughout the State to work for
McKinley. Postmaster Case says: "At
this crisis 1 believe it to be the duty of
every patriotic citizen to lay aside party
pride and join as one man to defeat tnis
Bryanitic party."

BANDIT VISITS NEW HOPE
Merchant Coblitz Compelled to
Give the Stranger His
Valuables.
Posses From Nearby Towns Engage
in a Search for the Bold
Outlaw.
NEW HOPE, Cal., Oct. 18.â This town
was visited by a lone highwayman early
this evening and to-night scores of men
are traversing the surrounding country
bent on persuading him to return and .re
main indefinitely as a guest of the county.
The Sheriffs at Stockton and Sacramento
and the Constabulary of neighboring
towns have been notified and have numer
ous posses afield.
Klauffer & Coblitz's store was entered at
9 o'clock by the stranger. Mr. Co blitz was
in the store alone, and when he looked up
as the door opened he was confronted by
a pistol in the hands of a man whose en
tire face was concealed by a white muslin
mask. *â¢
â The robber was about 5 feet 8 inches in
height, of stout build and dressed in a
blue duck jumper worn over dark trousers,
with black slouch. hat on his head. His
pistol was a small- caliber, cheap : concern.
Tbe robber compelled the proprietor to
deliver up what valuables he carried on
his person. They included a fony-four
caliber Colt's , revolver, a $5 bill, some
small change and a watch and chain. He
then backed out of the \ door and disap
peared.
SEEN IN SAN FRANCISCO.
The Misting Colonel Liken* of Tacoma
Sighted by an Acquaintance.
TACOMA. Wash., Oct. 18.â Councilman
P. D. Norton, who has just returned from
a meeting of the Central Lumber Com
pany at San Francisco, saw Colonel W.
W. Likens early last week on a street at
the bay metropolis. Norton was riding
on a streetcar when Likens walked by
twenty feet away. He was well dressed
and smiling.
Likens dropped out of sight nearly two
weeks ago. He was being pressed for
money by several creditors, and on his de
parture was accused of various question
able dealings.
Me had served four years in a Colorado
penitentiary for forgery and is alleged to
have been disbarred by the Superior Court
at Placerville, Cal., in 1879, tor changing a
mortgage after it was recorded. The bill
of sale found on the desk here, conveying
his belongings to F. O. Chezum, to whom
we was indebted, will be contested. Presi
dent Caesar of the Metropolitan Bank has
brought an attachment suit to recover
over $200 rent, and D. S. Johnston has
sued to recover possession of a piano
Likens had not paid for.
It is thought likely that Likens has
gone to Mexico or Australia.

the treatment accorded visiting riflemen,
P. Jacoby of San Francisco said :
"In behalf of my delegation I must say
that in all of our long years of experience
on the range we have never met with such
a royal reception before, nor have we ever
been called upon to compete for such a
list of valuable and handsome prizes.
They are beyond doubt the best ever of
fered at any tournament which has been
held on the coast. This is the first public
rifle match, open to all, which baa been
held in Sat ramento in eighteen years. I
attended the last one, as did my confreres,
Messrs. Ehrenpfort and Strecker, and dur
ing all the eighteen years past we have all
longed to come again to this city and com
pete with our generous hosts. Just eight
een years ago W. H. Eckhardt of Sacra
mento won the gold medal he wears to
day, defeating us all; but to-day luck has.
changed and Schuster of San Francisco
has carried off that honor."

DEATH STRIKES
IN THE CAPITAL
State Librarian Dana W.
Perkins Goes to His
Long Rest
Passes Peacefully Away After
an Illness of Ten
Months.
CAME TO THE STATE IN 1850
Abandoned a Search for Gold to Be
come a Democratic Leader
in Politics.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Oct. 18â Dana
W. Perkins, State librarian, calmly and
peacefully sank into his final rest at 11:45
o'clock thismomine.
Dana W. Perkins, pioneer, was a typical
Californian â open-handed, hospitable and
generous to a fault. He was born in Jef
feison, New Hampshire, on the 27th day
of February, 1831, coming to the coast in
1850. Upon bis arrival he engaged in min
ing on the headwaters of the American
River, and encountered all the hardships
and privations, successes and disappoint
ments incident to the early gold seeker.
Eventually he abandoned tbe search for
gold and established a hotel at Pine Grove,
and during the early history of the State
became interested in politics and was ulti
mately known as one of the leaders in
Democratic politics throughout the length
and breadth of the State.
He held the position of Tax Collector of
Placer County for two terms and was ser
geant-at-arms of the Assembly for several
years. He then entered the employ of the
Southern Pacific Railroad Company, and
was connected with the land department
of that corporation for years.
In 1890 Mr. Per Kins was appointed State
Librarian, and after serving in that ca
pacity for four years was reappointed for
a second term. Ou the Bth of last Decem
ber he was stricken with paralysis in San
Francisco, and was shortly afterward re
moved to bis residence in this city, where
be had since been confined to his bed al
most continually.
For years before the fatal stroke of
paralysis made him a hopeless invalid,
Mr. Perkins was a very active Mason and
attained high degrees in that fraternity,
but shortly after the attack he joined the
Catholic church and the rites of the faith
were administered to him. Up to a late
hour last night he was sensible and ap
parently recognized that the end was ap
proaching, but evinced no fear or uneasi
ness.
He is survived by a widow and two sons,
N. Dana Perkins, at present Assistant
State Librarian, and William Perkins of
Los Angeles. The funeral will take place
at 2 o'clock on Tuesday.
Rumor has it that Dr. Matthews will
probably be appointed to fill the unezpired
term of State Librarian.
MONEY FOR HOPE HALL.
Mrs. Booth Receives lAberal Contribu
tions for the Charity.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Oct. 18â Mrs.
Maud Ballington Booth, commands of
the prison branch of the American Volun
teers, addressed an immense audience at
the Congregational church in this city this
evening. Her descriptions of methods
pursued to reclaim prisoners and of the
homes founded for discharged convicts
were at times dramatic, and her magnet
ism caught her audience and bent it to her
wilL
The object of the meeting was to procure
contributions toward furnishing "Hope
Hall," the San Francisco home for ex
convicts, and so earnestly did Mrs. Booth
plead the cause of charity that over |400
was received. She left on tbe overland
train for New York to-night.
Died at His Pout.
SACRAMENTO, Cal.. Oct. 18â John
Carr, in the employ of Joseph Hahn, a
druggist, was found dead to-day behind
the prescription desk when the proprietor
entered the store. Carr died apparently
while engaged in cleaning tip the store
early in the morning. He was an old
resident and in early days was in the em
ploy of Justin Gates, a pioneer druggist.
COLUMBIA RIVER MONSTER.
Fisherman Startled by the Appearance of
a Hideous Reptile in the
Water.
PORTLAND, Ob., Oct 18.-Dominick
Bule, a pioneer and very reliable salmon
fisherman at Clifton, .Clatsop County, re
ported in Portland this morning that yes
terday, while he was out in the middle of
the Columbia River in bis boat, just about
dusk, he saw an immense living object sud
denly arise out of the water not twenty feet
away from him. It had a head like that of a
horse, covered with long hair, and its tusks,
four in number, were at least a foot long.
It stood out of the water about four feet
and remained stationary, as he thought,
about two minutes, its large eyes glaring
fiercely at him.
â  Bule was so terrified that he was almost
paralyzed. He stopped rowing and gazed
at the object. He was not armed, and
even hail he had a gatling-gun he was too
frightened to have used it. Suddenly the
stranger opened its immense mouth and
gave vent to a roar like that of a mad
dened bull. Then it began lashing the
water, and Buie could see that it was
about, as he estimated, twenty-five feet in
length. So vigorous were its motions
that great waves were created, and Bule's
boat came near upsetting. Finally the
monster dove and disappeared from
sight.
As honest as Bule is known to be, his
story was regarded as a fabrication until
to-night, when it was confirmed by Frank
Bolton, Henry Schmeer, William Farrell
and John Bost, all fishermen. They were
out in a boat early this morning, when
the monster came to the surface and acted
precisely in the same manner as when
Buie saw it. It did not attempt to molest
the .occupants of the boat, but when it dis
appeared in the water they got to land as
quick.'y as possible.
For the next few days a large party of
fishermen ou a big rait will watch for the
sea serpent, or whatever it may be, to kill
it by shooting if possible.
Wnnts a Vancouver Prisoner,
VANCOUVER. B. C, Oct. 18.â Sheriff
Barnes of Pike County, Ohio, arrived to

CIRCLE CITY DESPERADOES.
Alaska Miners Relieved of Their Fortunes
by Thugs â Rich Gold Strikes Near
Forty- Mile Creek.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., Oct 18.â
William Urqnbart of Seattle, for four years
isolated in the Arctic from civilization,
arrived this morning. Urquhart, better
known to everybody in the north as
"Daisy," reports Circle City overrun with
thugs and desperadoes of the worst sort,
and frequent robberies of miners returning
to civilization after undergoing the priva
tions of that distant clime. He was one of
the victims.
On arriving at Circle City Urquhart
wisely gave the greater portion of his dust
to a friend who was coming out ahead of
him. Reserving $590 with which to "see
the town" he started ont. A fellow named
Al Lester, who runs a notorious joint off
the main street, "saw him coming." This
was 4 o'clock in the afternoon, and at 11
o'clock the next morning, when he came
out of his trance, nis sack .was gone. De
manding of Lester to know where it was
that worthy said he had it, and returned
the little buckskin with a solitary crince of
dust. "Little Doc," another well-known
fellow in that land of nickname?, was re
lieved in the same place of $1100, none of
which was recovered.
Several rich strikes are reported by
Urquhart as having been made just be
fore ho left. One is called the (Jlondike
claim, out of which "Siwash George," a
white man. with the assistance of hia
dusky female companion, has averaged,
with three sluice boxes, $100 a day net
profit. This claim is located about forty
miles from Forty-mile Creek.
At Mastadon Creek several rich finds
are reported, but a locality glorying in the
ambitious title of Hog-Em-Ail Creek car
ries off the palm, the operators thereon
throwing out $100 with every shovelful of
earth put into tha sluices.
A claim several miles below on the same
creek was recently bought by Chris Har
rington for $5000, and at the first wash*
down he took out more gold than he had
put into the investment.

the result of a wound in the left breast,
received on the night of August 5, when he
was accidentally shot by a weapon which

PUBLIC SCHOOLS
OF PASADENA.
Institutions of Learning in
Which the City Takes
Pride.
Seven Mcdern Structures That
House Fifty Teachers and
2500 Pupils.
POPULAR THROOP INSTITUTE.
Opportunity Afforded Young People to
Fit Themselves for Trade or
Profession.
-
PASADENA, Cal., Oct. 17.â 0f all the
institutions in which the citizens of Pasa
dena take pride, none are held in.so high
esteem a<< tbe public schools of this fair
city. With seven handsome modern
school buildings, fifty teachers and some
2500 pupils, it furnishes educational ad
vantages unsurpassed by those of any city
of its size in the Union.
When in 1887 the Wilson School was
erected with its ten rooms it wa3 believed
that many years would elapse before it
would be filled, but the rapid growth of
the city of homes soon made other build
ings necessary and as the influx of citi
zens continues unabated additional build
ings will be needed to train up to useful
American citizenship the rapidly increas
ing school population.
The beneficial effects of tbe â¢llmate,
with the purest air, charming scenery and
abundant opportunity for outdoor sports
and occupations during the entire year,
make of this an ideal spot for developing
healthy, vigorous young men and women.
This is leading many to come here, at
tracted by the unexceptionable advant
ages for both physical and mental growth,
to make their homes, and thus the popu
lation of Pasadena is made up of the best
elements in the entire country.
So marked are the benefits of the sur
roundings that the remarfc is frequently
made by Eastern visitors that nowhere
else have they seen such sturdy, bright j
young people. The school buildings are
modern iv their structure -and equip
ment, supplied with the most approved
methods for heating and ventilating; the
arrangements for lighting are scientifi
cally correct and the buildings are placed
on ample grounds that furnish space for
both decoration and playgrounds. These
large open spaces provide for fresh air in
abundance, and the purest of mountain
water is piped bountifully to each of the
buildings.
The buildings are arranged in reference
to location, so that the High School and
one grammar school are in the central
part of the city and the remaining five at
radial points about midway to the limits
of the district and so placed that all are
accessible by electric or horse cars.
The grading of the schools is such as ob
tains in the best schools of the East, and
pupils after spending a year or two here
return to find their rank equal, if not su
perior, to that of their former classmates.
The primary and grammar grades com
prise eight years' work, in >vbich ail the
- usual work is done preparatory to en
trance to a high school.
Four more years' work is done in the
high school, in which there are three regu
lar courses. The classical, includiug the
usual Latin and Greek; the literary, in
which history or a modern language is
substituted for Greek, and the scientific
course, which comprises a full course in
the sciences, with modern laboratories
well equipped with modern appliances.
This department, which was organized in
1892, now occupies almost the entire Wil
son building and has an enrollment of
nearly 300 students, taught by a corps of
nine thoroughly trained instructors. The
school is accredited by both Stanford and
the State University and a large number of
graduates are either students at these in
stitutions or have already received their
degrees.
Our graduates now number 136, many of
whom are making marked success in pro
fessional and business enterprises.
In addition to and apart from the public
school system the Throop Polytechnic In
stitute stands as a monument to the
memory of that noble old man, Amos G.
Throop, known familiarly as "Father
Throop." Six years ago be laid the foun
dations of what promises to be one of the
great schools of the Pacific Coast, Even
at this early date it has earned the right to
be called great, for the plan of education
which it oners and which it hat> demon
strated its ability to successfully carry out,
is the broadest that engages the thought of
the advanced educators of to-day.
Throop Institute is a non-sectarian, man
ual training school in the highest and broad
est sense ot the word. It is not a trade school,
although the young man who finishes a
course in the Manual Training Academy
has an education which will enable him in
a short time to adapt himself to any trade
toward which he may find himself natur
ally inclined. And the young man who
does not take up a trade will find bim
eelf a better educated man than he would
out entrance examination. The manual
A GROUP OF PASADENA'S PUBLIC SCHOOL BUILDINGS.
have been without the manual lines. The
young ladies have equal opportunities
afforded, although not in the same
manual work as young men.
The school offers work in three depart
ments, viz. : I, Lloyd Grammar School;
11, Manual Training Academy; 111, Col
lege. The Lloyd Grammar School is pre
paratory to the academy, which in its
book work is equivalent to the grammar
grades of the public schools. This depart
ment has as one of its chief features a
well-equipped Lloyd school, euch as is
now being introduced into so many of the
best public schools of the country. The
Lloyd department offers also a special
Lloyd normal course, which fits teachers
for taking charge of work of this kind.
The demand for Lloyd teachers is increas
ing throughout this State. During the
past two years twelve persons have been
graduated from this course, and are find
ing ready demand for their services.
The Manual Training Academy is, in its
book work, equivalent to a nigh school
course of four years. Jts graduates are
admitted to Stanford and tr.e State Uni-
Yersity and. to Eastern universities with
course for boys consists of one year of
wood work, which is practice in joinery,
turning and cabinet worK; one year in
the forging-shop, with its many processes
in the manipulation of iron, including
tempering and ornamental iron work;
two years, in pattern and macbine-shop
practice. This shop is well equipped with
machines of the latest style, its cost alone
being nearly $10,000. A 55-horsepower
engine furnishes the power for driving the
machinery of wood, pattern and machine
shops, and the blowers and exhaust fan of
the forging-shop. The exhaust steam
from tbe engine boiler also heats the large
Polytechnic Hall. East Hall is heated by
hot water from a boiler in the basement.
The course for young ladies consists, in
the manual work, of cooking, for one year,
which embraces quite a jange of work in
this subject; plain sewing, one year; dress
making, one year; wood-carving and clay
modeling. They may also take the worK
of tne sloyd shop.' Drawing, either or
both freehand and mechanical, runs
throughout the course for both girls and
boys. The academy has already eleven
graduates.
The college department offers regular
collrge and university work. The course
is largely elective. Ttie institute last year
conferred the degree of A.B. upon two
students on completion of their college
course, one A.B. in electrical engineering,
the other A.B. in biology. The labora
tories for biology, chemistry and physios
arc well eauipped with up-to-date appar
atus, and in all departments modern edu
cational ideas are dominant.
The faculty is made up of educa
tors of standing and ability, gradu
ates of the best colleges and scientific
schools. Tlie location of the school is
convenient and desirable and all things
considered combines tho<e elements which
go to make up a school to be eagerly
sought by young people generally.
Throop Institute has two large brictc
buildings, located in ample grounds,
planned and constructed for the use of a
manual training-school that represents a
cost of some $60,000. The equipment of
machinery ranks with ttie oest in the
United State 9 and cost $18,000. The en
tire plant is the gift of "Father Throop"
to the citizens of Pasadena, with the un
derstanding that it is to be maintained as
a non-sectarian school. It is managed by
a board of trustees. There are a number
of scholarships donated by public-spirited
citizens and it will receive quite a large
endowment from the estate of the founder.
There are two excellent private classical
schools in the city, one for youug men
and one for young women, also a number
of successful kindergartens and a business
college.
The entire school system of the city,
both public and private, tills the require
ments of the large and highly intelligent
community.
The people themselves are aggregations
of the beut from widely different parts of
the East, and they bring with them a
varied experience in school matters which
has crystalized into what is now available
in thatline here.
The schools are one of the dominant
factors in giving Pasadena the grÂ«Â»at repu
tation it now has as a most desirable place
for a home. In fact there seems to be lit
tle lacking in Pasadena as a home city, a
place to lead a quiet refined life â an ideal
place in which to bring up a family of
children. ______^____

Edward O. Halm's Body to Be Reduced
to Ashes To-Day.
C. O. Hahn of 2737 California street re
turned yesterday from Bakersfield with
the remains of his son E. O. Hahn, the
young attorney who perished recently in
the desert sixty miles west of that city.
Young Hahn went to San Luis Obispo
County on land business and in making
the trip from that city to Bakersneld on
foot he aDparently overestimat 'd his
strength and perished by the wayside
where his body was buried by a coroner's
jury.
Mr. Hahn had a hard trip over moun
tains and long stretches of land on which
there is but littla vegetation and few signs
of water. He learned that his son had
left bis coat and vest at McDonald's ranch
on October 6, and started out on foot lor
his destination. He carried a bottle of
water. The body was found about twelve
miles southwest of Asphalt and all ap
pearances indicated that he had lain down
on the ground near the road exhausted
and never awoke.
The remains of the young attorney were
brought to this City in a tin-lined box.
The family elected to have the body cre
mated at Odd Fellows' Cemetery at 2
o'clock to-day.

SALINAS, Cal., Oct. 17.â October 15,
1896, will be long remembered by the mem
bers of Troop C, for on that day they form
ally occupied their new armory at the cor
ner of Alisal and Salinas streets, and not
only occupied it but had a good "house
warming" at the same time. The build
ing, but recently completed, 45x130 feet,
is built of brick and Arizona sandstone
and was specially designed for Troop C.
It was built by P. Zabala, a wealthy capi-
talist of Salinas, and it very complete in
all its arrangements. At the left of tbe
front entrance is the double ladies' parlors,
14x32 feet and elegantly furnished by mem
bers of Troop C, and among the ornamen
tations are many donations of beauty
from the lady friends of the troop. To
the right of the main entrance is the read
ing room and lounging rooms for members
of the troop, which are well supplied with
good reading matter and amusements and
are very homelike'in appearance.
The entire building is supplied with
gas and electric lights and other con
veniences. The main drill hall has folding
doors opening to ladies' parlors, and an
other opening to the reading-room. The
drill hall is surrounded on tbree sides by
a gallery, reached by a stairway opening
from the large reading-room.
The troop gave a special exhibition
drill and guard mount on October 15, fol
lowed by a ball, which was attended by
the youth and beauty of Salinas and else
where. The officers and several mem
bers of the Naval Reserves of Saiita Cruz
attended in full uniform, and the ball was
in fact the most brilliant ever given in
Salinas.
Troop C is now ready for the long win
ter nights, and Captain Burke is de
termined that the efficiency of the troop
shall be as perfect as its new armory is
elegant and commodious. Every member
of the troop has a locker for his uniform
and arms, and will be held more than
ever personally responsible for their ap
pearance and condition.
John L. Matthews, senior first lieuten
ant, has tendered his resignation, and his
probable successor will be Second Lieuten
ant Frank M. Viena, whose place- will
likely be filled by the efficient first ser
geant of the troop, F. S. Clark.
One of the pleasant features of the even
ing was the address of Hon. Thomas
Flint Jr., who was introduced as the
"father of Troop C." He is very popular
with the members of the troop, who give
him the credit of having a troop located
at Salinas, and as he is now a candidate
for re-election to the State Senate the
boys of Troop C will most likely remem
ber him kindly for his zealous and suc
cessful efforts In their behalf.
Second Brigade.
The organization of the Second Brigade
Officers' Association was finally perfected
at the California Hotel last Tuesday even
ing. General R. H. Warfield is president
of the association. The vice-presidents
are: Colonel William Macdonald, Jfirst
Infantry, and Colonel D. is. Fairbanks,
Fifth Infantry.
Lieutenant-Colonel Victor D. Duboce,
First Infantry, is chairman of the cam
paign committee. Under the direction of
the committee a circular has been sent to
each candidate of the Legislature In Sec
ond Brigade territory asking if tne as
pirant for legislative honors is in favor of
maintaining the National Guard accord
ing to law.
A communication has been sent by the
association to General Last of the First
Brigade and General Muller of the Third
Brigade, asKing co-operation in tbe work
of advancing the interests of the National
Guard.
The old organization of the National
Guard commissioned officers embraced all
tbe officers in the service of the State.
Many times it wai inconvenient for offi
cers living quite a distance from San Fran
cisco to attend tne general meeting!. The
present plan of brigade organization, pre
senting facility for joint meeting of bri
gade committees, will insure harmony of
action at Sacramento.
Colonel Macdonald and field officers of
the First Infantry are planning for a regi
mental field day.
Should the plan now under contempla
tion be carried out the regiment will leave
town, each man carrying a ration, and
pass the day near Ingleside. Major-Gen
eralJames, the division commander, has
promised to attend with the division staff
mounted. On the field the. exercises may
consist of company and battalion drill and
possibly a review of the regiment in honor
of the major-general.
Colonel Fairbanks of the Fifth Infantry
has ordered a regimental court-martial to
convene at the armory of Company A,
Oakland, next Thursday evening for the
trial of Private George Ginn, charged with
disobedience of orders. Major L. W.
Juillard will preside.
Lieutenant A. A. Borline will act as in
spector of rifle practice in the Fifth In
fantry during the absence of Lieutenant
E. S. Heller.
Company F of tne First Infantry, which
was formerly Battery F of the Second Ar
tillery, will give a grand ball on Thurs
day evening.October 29. It will be given
at National Hall, 815 Ellis street.
The baseball team of Company F is
willing at any time to try conclusions
with a team from any other company of
the National Guard.
Third Brigade.
MERCED, Cal., October 15.â The past
week was marked by tbree more applica
tions for membership in Company H, Sixth
Infantry. Recruiting is being systemati
cally carried oc, and many new men are
being added to the roll to take the places
of term-expired men awaiting discharge
and to fill Tacancies caused by removal.
Private Deamude has removed to Wat
sonville and the company regrets the loss
of a good member.
Tlif range committee has under advise
ment plans for the improvement of the
company's target grounds, the installing
of 300 and 500 yard ranges and a general
betterment of all arrangements.
Private Griffith has been appointed to
this committee to fill a vacancy, a selection
which is highly approved by all concerned,
as he is not only the best shot in tbe com
pany, but taices a deep interest in all that
pertains to the service, and particularly in
tareet practice.
WOODLAND, Cal., Oct. 16.â The first
of the series of socials to be given by Com
pany F, Second Infantry, took place last
evening. All who attended are loud in
their praises of the management and pre
dict a successful future for these socials.
The company was out Wednesday even
ing tor drill in extended order and ac
quitted itself admirably. The drill was by
signal and bugle. This was the first drill
with the bugle and a person would think
that the boys had been drillins by it for
some time to see how quickly they learned
the calls. Next week the company is to
have a drill in guard mount; also In
platoon movements.
No new members were sworn in last
Wednesday, but tbe captain expects to
have at least four to swear in next Wednes
day.
The 600-yard range is the principal topic
among the boys at present The captain
is looking for a place to locate it, and tne
chances are very favorable that it will be
located in the tales about three and a half
miles east of town.
The State shoot took place last Satur
day and the scores were above the average,
showing that tbe hoys had been doing
some practicing. Forty -lour officers and
men participated. Out of that number
two were gold- bar men, several silver
bar men and a good many bronze-bar
men. Beveral of the boys failed to make
the required percentage, consequently they
will get no medals. Adjutant Lee and
Lieutenant Plant made 47 and 46 respect
ively with the pistol, remarkable scores
when taking into consideration that the
north wind was blowing nearly a gale.
Dame Rumor says that two or three of
the boys are to be court-martialed in the
near future. But who they are and what
the offense may be, no one seems to know.
Everything is being carried out in mili
tary style here at present. Every man has
been given a haversack, canteen, knife,
fork, spoon and cooking utensils. Once a
week the captain appoints an inspector,
whose duty it is to report any man who is
lax in his duty in the way of keeping his
equipments in the proper shape. It shows
the boys what is expected of them if they
should be called into active service.
As yet the company has not received a
visit from any of the higher officials of the
N. G. C. The boys would like to see them.
BACRAMENTO, Cal., Oct. 17.â But J it
tie activity is being displayed among the
companies of the Third Brigade at the
present time, owing to the excitement at
tending the coming election, but as many
of the members are connected with the
crack uniform clubs now organized they
are receiving their full ration of drill.
Lieutenant Fred 8. Martin, command-
Ing the Signal Corps, Third Brigade, is
making a business trip through Placer
County. On his return he will probably
have something to report as to conditions
for heliograph work between stations in
that county and the capital.
The outing of the corps at Woodland
was a great success and afforded a bit of
camp life to some of the newer members
who have not heretofore tasted of the joys
of military work in tbe field.
There were but two absentees when roll
was called Saturday night, October 3, pre
paratory to starting. The ride of twenty
two miles to Woodland was made in the
dark, leaving Sacramento about 9:30 p. M.,
the last stragglers showing up at Wood
land about 3 a. m. Sunday. Horses were
picketed and fed and guards set, and such
of tbe members as were not too stiff to lie
down on the stubble-field rolled them
selves in their blankets and snatched a
few winks of sleep between that time and
reveille, which was sounded at 6 o'clock.
After feed-call and breakfast Lieutenant
Martin put the corps through various
cavalry movements and mounted saber
and pistol drill. The men then rode to
the target range, but on account of the
very heavy wind and the use of the new
38-caliber pistols for tbe first time, the
scores made were not astonishing.
By this time the corps had earned a
well-deserved rest, and after dinner and a
few hours of relaxation the ride home was
begun, Sacramento being reached at 8
o'clock Sunday evening.
The corps has a dance on the tapis, a
committee having been appointed to at
ten J to this social function.
Company G was also well pleased with
its outing at Woodland and has a good
opinion of the courtesy of Company F.
All the company is ordered out for bat
talion drill on the evening oi the 29tb,
when the annual ball will take place.
Company G is noted for its entertain
ments and a big crowd and a big time is
expected.
The resignation of Sergeant Dan Me-
Carty, who will shortly leave tbe city to
make his future home in San Francisco,
has been handed in and accepted.
Tbe term of Sergeant W. H. Bentine
will expire with this month. He, too, will
move to San Francisco.
lc is not yet definitely settled who will
be candidates for promotion to the places
left vacant.
The report of tbe court-martial proceed
ings has been handed to Colonel Guthrie
by Captain Steams, but it is not yet ready
for the public.

VALLEJO, Cal., Oct. 18.â The monitor
Monad nock, being practically in the hands

It is stated that at no time since the war
has a larger number of ships been lying at
the island than were seen there to-day.
There appears to be work to be done on
each of them and there is no apparent
likelihood of a reduction of the force after

STILL GOING SKYWARD,
Prices on Wheat Are Steadily
Climbing Higher and
Higher.
Albert Gerberding of tbe Produce
Exchange Predicts a Season
of Prosperity.
Albert Gerberding, president of the
Produce Exchange, predicts a long season
of prosperity for California, and declares
that the present advance in wheat signi
fies a return of good times. Speaking on
this topic last night he said:
"All at once the world appreciates the
fact that wheat is wheat. There have
been two failures in Australia, a partial
failure in India, a diminished supply in
the Argentine Republic and a light crop
in Russia. Prices will not recede, but, on
the contrary, advance. The rally is note
worthy in California, because the extreme
of depression was reached in this State.
"No, 1 do not predict any failures or
disasters among brokers on account of the
I advance. There may be some pinching,
| but the result will be prosperity for the
farmers. I am surprised that the Dews
papers did not make more of â¢ the signifi
cant fact that a cargo of wheat was re
cently shipped from this port consigned
to India. 1 am informed that three or
four more cargoes will shortly follow for
the same destination. It is not the dis
posal of the surplus on hand that will
bring better times, but the assurance to
the farmer of a future market. Whenever
the farmers obtain profitable prices for
their products prosperity will return.
"The advance is all along the line," con
tinued Mr. Gerberding, "and it signifies to
me that brighter times are in store for
California. Every industry of the State
will participate in tbe benefits to accrue."
POLLING BOOTHS.
The Polks* Instructed to Prevent Their
Removal From Their -Established
Locations.
Several polling booths at North Beach
have been removed from their orig
inal locations to other locations close to
a grocery or saloon where steam beer is
sold.
For weeks delegations have waited upon
Registrar Hinton requesting him, to
change the location of booths, but their
request has, as a rule, been refused. This
has led to tbe removal of the booths dur
ing the night, in the hope that the Re gis
trar would not bear the expense of taking
them back. One booth on the corner of
Lombard and Larkin streets was removed
during Thursday night and the material
dumped into tbe sand on the northwest
corner of Bay and Larkin streets.
The Registrar addressed a letter to Chief
Crowley calling his attention to the mat
ter and requested his co-operation In pre
venting the removal of the booths. A list
of established polling places was inclosed.
The captains of each district have been
furnished with copies of the list, and or
ders have been read to the men to keep a
careful watch on the booths.

Portola Hall, in Native Sons' building, was
crowded last night to hear Count Wachtxnels
ter's lecture before the Golden Gate Theosoph
lcal Society. The Count has made a study of
the Goga practice of India and his lecture last
night wai an exposition of their system of
"mediation and the powers of mind." The
lecturer maintained it is as easy to build up a
habit of right thought and action as It Is to
fall into evil ways. "As a man thinketh so he
is.* 1 The Count will probably, In a later lec
ture, tell of hlÂ« travels and the society In
India. These free lectures will be continued
throughout the winter.
WILL MEET AT THE CAPITAL.
County Asaetaors of the State Arrange
for a Conftrenee.
STOCKTON, Cal., Oct. 18.â A meeting
of the County Assessors of the State will
be held In Sacramento on October 23 for
consultation on ways and means of get
ting the full assessment of the property of
the counties. The meeting is brought
about primarily by the efforts made by
the Assessors of this and other counties to
get satisfactory statements of property
from the banks and large corporations. It
is probable that one result of the confer
ence will be the drafting of certain laws
which the Assessors will have submitted
to the next Legislature, and by which
they will hope to be able to do their work
more satisfactorily. Among other things
they will ask that the State banks be comp
elled to hand statements to them suxiUm
to those now sent to the Bank Commis
sioners. _

DEPRECIATED PAPER MONEY.
Worfa Oaly 35 Cents, but Performs
Singular Purposes Within the
Country's Boundaries.
A distinguished party of gentlemen
from Buenos Ayres, Argentine, are at the
California, on a tour of the world. The
party consists of Dr. F. R. Leloir, a lead
ing jurist and extensive land-owner; A. C.
Leloir, his cousin; Professor Patrick Mc-
Manus of the chair of English in the Ar
gentine National College, and Consul
general Carlos Roht, who represents his
country in New York.
The gentlemen crossed the Andes to
Chile, visited Bolivia, Pern, Ecuador and
Colombia, crossed and recrossed the Isth-

mns of Panama, visited the Central Amer
icar; States and made a considerable trip
through Mexico. Then they went to the
big cities of the East and are now bound
to China, Japan. India and other coun
tries, expecting to be absent a year and a
half and to finally cross from Paris to
Argentine.
"It will surprise you to hear what pros
perity we now have in Argentine," said
Professor MacManus Saturday. "It has
recovered completely from the collapse
which occurred six years ago, and business
is going forward steadily.
"We have been on a gold basis for
twenty years. We had and vet have sub
sidiary silver mines the same as in the
United States, but during the boom we
issued paper money so freely that at
length we couldn't meet our obligations,
and it bad to be passed as a forced cur
rency. All our silver coin disappeared
from night to morning. It was bearded,
and, as for gold, which we needed in ttie
transaction of our foreign business, it had
to be bougbt.
"Our paper dollars went down so that
they were worth but 25 cents each in gold.
To-ciay they are worth 35 cents each, and
are going ud, tbouch the government
never promised to redeem them. The paper
has been of immense advantage to us.
"Labor there is performed almost solely
by Italians. They get $40 a month in the
paper money. Bjt erne of their paper
dollars will buy as much beef, wheat or
any other product" as the gold will buy
here. There are 100 cents in each of thopie
dollars so far as us use in Argentine is
concerned. They answer the purposes of
business admirably.
"The biggest money there is now being
made out of cattle-raising, wool-raisin â 
and the growing of wheat. For these
branches of industry there are large prof
its. Fortunes are being made out of them
each year. A good ranch of, say, nine
squares miles, close to Buenos Ayres, will
rent for $40,000 a year.
-I would not advise any young pro
fessional menâ as, for instance, lawyers
and doctorsâ to go to Argentine. The
country is literally full 01 them. There
are big colleges there and they are turn
ing them out by thousands every year. If
a man full of health has a little money he
can go there and make money in sheep,
cattle or wheat raisins, but not in the pro
fessions. Argentine is very similar to
California In its climate and in its re
f-ources. It is a charming country 10
live in." ___^__
HORSEMEN GETTING IN.
A Number of Bookmakers anil Jockey*
â¢Arrive From -t. Louie.
Another detachment of turf devotees ar
rived from the: East yesterday. Among
them were Willie Harris, the well-known
steeplechase rider; Hughey Janes, the
bookmaker; "Doc" Loiuh, a brother of
Eugene Leigh; L. Tavon and W. McFar
lane, employes of Barney Scbrieber; Wil
liam Barr and Arthur Dexter. ; Georce
Cochran, the steeplechase jocKey, came
over the mountains with the party, but
stopped over at Sacramento. J. Cochran, |
the father of the steeplechase rider, and
"Humpty DumDty" Earl Cochran, the
fl;it rider, left St. Louis lor California last
night.
Henry Forslant, the form book man, is
also back from St. Louis overllowing with
information that he thinks will result in
pecuniary euin ihi> coming winter.
Bookmaker Johnny Coleman, very pop
ular with local raceeo'irs, who has been
enjoying a season of hunting and fishing
at Late Tahoe, landed at the OaKland
ferry last evening with a bis bagful of
wild iianie, looking every inch a market
hunter. A friend of tbe pencillers states
that Johnny told him be hooked one trout
that had sixteen silver speckles on its
sides and one gold one on its bead. Of
course, as h? was caught in the State of
Nevada this can hardly be taken as a fish
yarn.
A recently-arrived Montana horseman
is authority for tbe statement that the
French plunger Pierre Wibaux will be in
California by November 1, fully equipped
for another tussle with the book-making
iraternity.
The refusal of the California Jockey
Club to accept the entries of Will Wallace
and its avowed intention to exclude Riley
Grannan from its course are decred on all
bides and wiil have a tendency to add still
further to the drooping popularity of the
track across^the bay. It would not be sur
prising if the Southern horsemen were to
declare a boycott on the California Jockey
Club folks.
GUN AND GAME.
Slight Improvement in Yesterday's
Bagsâ Trouble as "Set With
Preserve Lessees.
Quite a number of local sportsmen re
turned last ni>:ht -from .the. SuiÃun," So
noma and San Pablo marshes.
The increased wind yesterday has ap
parently resulted in somewhat improved
bags, as many as thirty quail having
fallen 'o one exceptionally fortunate Nim
rod. Several report average bags of fiftepn
birds each, while others again have been
less successful.
The entire district between Tiburon and
San Eafaei is said to be fairly overrun by
quail and duck shooters, who are largely
availing themselves of the facilities which j
the San Francisco ana North Pacific Coast
Railroad has piaced at their disposal. So
far, at any rate, the hunters have had no
trouble with the lessees of preserve Janes
in the vicinity of Suisun, but of course
there is no telline what the morrow may
bring forth in this respect.
BASE HITS IN BUNDLES.
Yesterday's Ball Game Charac
terized by Runs Scored
in Bunches.
Enthusiasm and Interest in the Sport
Increasing as the S^son
Wanes.
What at first glow appeared, in pros
pect, an easy victory for tbe Imperials
yesterday turned out to be a crushing de
feat. In the first inning the leaders in
the league race sized up "Scissors" Cooney
for five hits, one a double and two triples,
and piied up five runs. After that, how
ever, they were unable to bunch their
swats, with the result that the San Fran
ciscos overcame their lead and at the end
won by a big margin.
The local men were first at bat and
placed four tallies to their credit on a base
on balls, Krug's base for being hit by a
pitched ball and hits by Murphy and
Sweenev. The Imperials then score > rive
on the batting streak already mentioned,
and added another in tbe second on
Creamer's single and Wilds' two-bagger,
but that ended their successes.
The locals, by a combination of fielding
errors and a safe drive by Leonard, goi
Sweeney around the circuit" in the third,
and in the sixth tied the score, without
making a hit. In the seventh Monahan
and Murphy safely completed the journey
around the bags, and in the eighth Iberg
and Cooney placed two more earned runs
with the collection of the locals. The final
inning xas barren of results.

PACIFIC CRICKETERS WIN.
The Final Hnnter-Harrlnon Cap Match
of the *eaf>on.
The concluding cricket match of the
long-drawn-out contest for the Hunter-
Harrison silver cup was played yesterday
at the Alameda grounds. It was between
the Pacific and California teams, and re
sulted in an easy victory for tbe former by
153 runs. In justice to the defeated side
it is only fair to record that they had but
ten men to put in the field, four of whom
were substitutes.
Going in first, on the choice of their
opposing chief, the Californias compiled a
modest 56â Geilatly, in a nondescript
way, scoring the maximum total.
When U is noted that the first to bat for
the victors scored 86 off his own bat, ad
ditional comment is haVdly called for.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, OCTOBER 19, 1896.
NO WAVY PLUMES
ON PRETTY HEADS
Society Belles and Matrons
Discuss the The
ater Hat.
To Wear a Small Bonnet or No
Bonnet at All, a Moot
Question.
WILL THE GENTLIMIHT WAIT?
Aigrettes Must Go, for the Comfort
of Others Is Fashion's First
Consideration.
If there is any foundation for troth in
the generally accepted idea that fashion
can mar or make a custom, then the big
hat at the theater is doomed.
Society will have no more of it. With
out a funeral note or a single tear its ban
ishment has been proclaimed, and there
is only sorrowing in the world of the
comic (?) weekly paper and tne habitual
grumbler's retreat. Like the Moor the
artists of the humorous sheets and their
discontented brethren find their occupa
tion gone.
It would be but natural should Manager
Houvier of the Baldwin claim for himself
this great fin de siecle triumph â the de
struction of the big theater hat.
It would be natural, but hardly fair.
The time was ripe. His polite remindnr
as to the rights and comfort of others was
only the proverbial last straw that broke
the camel's back.
The big-hat problem has proved among
other things tbat all this talc of the self-
"The Realization of a Dream."
This gentleman paid for a seat and
got more than he bargained for â
hence his cheerfulness.
fshness of society is a delusion and a
snare.
There is no denying it. The big hat is
picturesque, and what is more, becoming,
and when tbe bud or the belle or the
matron slipped oat her hatpins and put
her hat in her lap she did a noble thing.
There are many sides to the moot hat
question. First of all it is a case of hat or
no hat. Then there is the interesting sub
ject of "dressine-room," and last but not
least the all-important factor, the fitness
of things.
As it is to society that suffering man
kind will owe tbe inestimable favor of the
banishment of the millinery tower from
the theater, so it is to society all must
looK for the ultimate decision of the all
absorbing question.
With this end in view ten of our most
prominent society belles and matrons were
interviewed, and their lack oi hesitancy
in dealing with the intricacies of the
vexed question clearly showed that they
had giyen the subject much deep thought,
and they expressed themselves decidedly,
tersely and plainly.
It is only a few evenings ago that Miss
Elizabeth Carroll sat behind a big hat,
44 We spcafc from experience,"
say many society ladies.
and perhaps that had something to do
with the forcible manner in which she de
clared for "no hat at all."
"No hats of any description, or bonnets
either," said Miss Carroll. "Not only do
they shut off the view of the stiiee, but
they make you so nervous dodging from
side to side that you also miss every word
of the r>lay. I would have every one lake
their hats off just before the curtain rises
and hold them on their laps. Tiie hair is
dressed so severely plain just now that
there is no necessity for a glass."
Miss Jennie Blair says "all hats must
go." "For," argues the popular belle,
"no matter how big that hat you may
have on you are discontented and angry if
you hit behind a bonnet that incon
veniences your vision. Everybody in 'he
theater is entitled to an unobstructed
view of the stage, and consideration for
the comfort of others should always be
our first tboueht. The little bonnet is
frequently as annoying as a big hat. I
have dodged from side to side behind a
harmless-looking aigrette, so speak from
experience."
Mrs. Downey Harvey is an enthusiastic
supporter of thÂ« small theater bonnet.
A bonne, built on such lines that there
w ill be no plumes or aigrettes to dodge.
"I do not consider it correct form to wear
no hat with the usual dark costume one
wears at the theater. No hat is only ap
propriate with full dress, and I for one
always feel extremely awkward walking
down the center aisle muffled tomv throat
and no hat on. I believe one should wear
a small nat that will in no possible way
obstruct the vision of those behind you.
Everybody is entitled to an unobstructed
view of the stage and has a perfect right
to demand of the one seated in front to re
move her hat if it in anj way annoys
them.*' \
Miss Isabel McKenna also favors the
small theater bonnet. Miss McKenna ob
jects to removing her hat at the theater.
"To go to the play," says Miss McKenna,
"without a hat on one should go in a car
riage, and it is not every one who can
afford a carriage every time they can af
ford to ko to the play. But 1 should
always .counsel a tiny bat that would not
possibly inconvenience anybody."
Mrs. ifl. B. Pond has looked or. the ques
tion from many sides and expects fashion
to come to the rescue in introducing a
head covering that may be removed with
out the assistance of a glass. Says Mrs.
Pond: "I believe it will be fully as pleas
ant for the women as for the men if every
one should remove their hats. I do not
fancy leaving the hats in a dressing-room.
Tne men would never wait for us until we
"The men would not wait for
us to put our hats on after the
play," said Mrs. E. B. Pond.
got our hats back after the play, and 1 am
sure they would never take us more to the
theater. I feel confident, however, fash
ions will come to our rescue and invent a
convenient head dress that may be easily
removed. Yes, I want all hats, small or
iarge, off."
Miss Laura McKlnstry, with her usual
consideration for the comfort of others,
always removes her hat. "All hats off,"
says Miss McKinstry, "and, don't you
know, I think all women look much pret
tier so."
Mrs. Southard Hoffman thinks we
should in all things be prompted by our
consideration for the comfort of others,
and advocates either hats off or a small
bonnet 'hat will inconvenience no one.
Mrs. Darling favors a omall bonnet, with
neither plumes nor aigrettes that might
prove an annoyance to the one behind
you. "If the dressing-rooms were like in
England," says Mrs. Darling, "large and
well liehted, I should b? in favor of re
moving all hats. When the hair is elab
orately dressed a glass is absolutely neces
sary for removing the hat. As we have
no conveniences in the theaters here I de
clare for small bonnets, without plumes or
aigrettes â just a bow ar.d a flower. They
will inconvenience no one."
Mrs. Evan J. Coleman favors no hats at
all at the theater. "No hats at all," says
Mrs. Coleman, "means comfort for all,
and, to my way of thinking, is a very
pretty siÂ« t."
Miss Carrie Gwin believes the present
style of coiffure is much t o-severe to look
pretty, and therefore favors small flat
hats, with neither bows nor feathers nor
aigrettes that might obstruct tbe vision.
"A little hat that will inconvenience no
one," says Miss Gwin, % 'is my choice."
Thotightfulness must rank first among
Mrs. JVweit'3 many qualities. So it is not
surprising that she advocates no hats at
the theater. "I am strongly in favor of
the ladies wearing no hat whatsoever at
the theater," says Mrs. Jewe.tt. 'There is
always the chance that you may be ob
structing somebody's view of the stage,
bo to be on the &afe side, I say no hats, no
bonnets."

Schuetzon Park, near San Rafael, was a
scene of activity yesterday, and Captain
Fred Schumann, the proprietor of the
premises, was kept busy all day attending
to the comfort of his guests. It was the
last of the picnic season, and the captain
decided that he would give the last pic
nic. It was a success, for by n< on there
were 1200 people in the park, and the next
train swelled the number to 1500. There
was dancing in the pavilion and bowling
in the alley, and above the sounds of mer
riment was the spiteful crack of dozens of
target-rifles on the shooting-range. At
noon the centers of attraction were the
tables in the dining hall and the lunch
baskets in the arbors and under the oaks.
As suggested, it was a lively day in the
shooiing-range, several clubs holding their
regular cash prize and medal contests.
The California Schuetzen Club held its
regular bullseye shoot, twenty shots to
each marksman. Tne high man of the
day was J. Wollmer, a comparatively new
rifle shot. His best bullet was within

LONG-DISTANCE CASTING.
The Members of the California Club to
Meet on Saturday.
Yesterday before the fog set in a num
ber of fly-casters who belong to the Cali
fornia Club were at the western end of
Stow Lake, practicing, preparatory to tak
ing part in the contest' to be held there
next Saturday afternoon. This wili be the
last of a series of ten contests inaugurated
by the clud some time ago. At the close
a medal will be awarded to each of the
three who make the greatest number of
wins. A good deal of interest has been
taken by sportsmen in these contest*, and
the officers of the club are of the opinion
that there will be some very long casts,
and possibly some record-breaking.
On the 7th of next raoLt'i there will be
a grand event at tbe lake under the
auspices of the club. It will bo a lone
distance casting contest, open to all com
ers. A number of individuals who are
known to be experts in whipping the line
and who had been barred in the club con
tests by reason of not being members
have signified their intention of exhibit
ing their skill.
Held Up by a Crazy Man.
A man by the name of Kiordan had a thrill
ing experience with a crazy man on the cor
ner of McAllister and Laguna streets last
night. Just as he reached the corner of the
lasi'iianu'd street a man ordered him to throw
up his hands. Instead of obeying, however,
Kiordan showed figtit, whereupon the stranger
took to his heei>-. Offi.ers Benjamin and
Clancy captured the man and at the City
Prison he was identified as W. F. Barrett, who
gained some notoriety during the Durrant
trinl. Barrett, it will be remembered, created
a scene in court by dec aring his belief in the
innocence of the young student. He was ar
rested, tried befone the Insanity Commis.-ion
and committed to the Kaps Insane Asylum.
Barrett was discharged about three weeks ago
as cured. It is now thought that the old mal
ady has returned, though this time it has as
sumed a dangerous form.

FOB FRESIDEN'T-
WILLIAM McKINLEY, of Ohio
tOS VICF-PKESIDENT-
GARRET A. BOBART, of New Jersey
Election November 3, J896.
The fight is about over, but don't forget
the shouting.
In a little while noâ the fusion and con
fusion will end together.
Time flies and good citizens will get in
and make the Popocrat fur fly also.
What will we profit by the rise in wheat
if the money goes abroad for foreign
goods?
The argument of the campaign is ex
hausted, but all the same the oratory will
continue.
Now is the opportunity of California.
Money is coming into the State, let us
keep it here.
Do your duty from now to election day.
Work for sound money, sound business
and sound men.
Republicans of San Francisco, now is
your opportunity. A united vote will win
a sweeping victory.
Toucan help to make California safe for
McKinley if yon assert yourself vigorously
for the welfare of you own industry.
The coming prosperity will be only
temporary under free trade, but a return
to protection will make it permanent.
Illinois has become the storm center of
the campaign, but all the straws show tfie
wind is blowing in the right direction.
Municipal politics may not, be as inter
esting to tbe mind as National politics,
but it touches the pocket just as closely.
Do your share in the campaign for pro
tection and prosperity. That is the way
to attend to your business at this juncture.
Once more we remind you to look out
for tbe campaign roorback. It never
frightens anybody who knows it is com
ing.
Everybody may as well get ready for big
business after the election, it is bound to
come in with the advance agent of pros
perity.
From the way the Popocrat managers
have concentrated their fight in Illinois it
looks as if they were more eager to elect
Altgeld than Bryan.
With one watchword the Republican? of
San Francisco can assure California to the
cause of protection ana prosperity, and
that word is harmony.
This will be a lively week in the Re
publican campaign and every wide-awake
citizen should keep up with the proces
sion and enjoy the music.
The campaign of education has been
pretty effective and there is reason to
believe even Bryan will bave learned his
lesson by tbe time the election is over.
After the election there will be a post
mortem, and then we can learn whether
the Democrat swallowei the Populist or
the Populist swallowed the Democrat.
It is said that some of the Watson
â¢lectors on the fusion tickets in the South
bave declared they will not vote for Brvan
unless the Brvan men will vote for Wat
son, and so there is another ruction in
Bight.
As the dark shadow of disaster fell upon
the country as soon as it was known tbat
the Democrats had carried the election in
1892, bo now the light of prosperity begins
to shine as soon as the people have been
virtually assured of Republican success.
The speech of Senator Hoar at Boston
on his arrival from Europe was most
timely in every respect, for it not only
clearly pointed out the evils which would
result from silver monometallism, but
gave convincing reasons for believing that
Europe is ready to enter into that inter
national agreement for the free coinage of
silver which the Republican party is
pledged to promote.
Dana Perkins, whose death is announced
in the dispatches from Sacramento, was a
Californian who was widely known
throughout the State, and highly re
garded by the men who knew him best.
He was a Democrat of the old school and
quite a successful politician. It was re
marked that the office of Librarian of the
State Libraiy, which bis party friends be
stowed on him some years ago, was a posi
tion tbat did not accord with his training
or inclinations, but nevertheless he man
aged to discharge the duties of the place in
an acceptable manner. If be did not
know books he knew men about the Legis
lature. His character was what may be
styled the ragged type. He possessed a
strong sense of justice, and people nad
faith in His honesty of purpose.
DEMOCRACY AND ITS LEADER.
The Democratic party in nominating
Mr. Bryan for the Presidency broke away
from its leaders, but did not violate any of
its traditions. That party, while it has
been for some years under the control of
conservatives, ha 3 never been a conserva
tive party. It has tried time and again to
release itself from the men who held it,
and what it has accomplished this year
has been simply what it thought to do re
peatedly in the past.
The radical declaration for free silver in
the platform of this year is not more ex
treme than was the declaration for free
trade in the platform of 1892. The cry
against capital now is not wilder than
was the cry against capital then. The
platform of 1892 said: "We denounce Re
publican protection as a fraud, a robbery
of the great majority of the American
people for the benefit of the few." With
this cry of fraud and robbery the party
was ready to enter tbat year as eagerly
as in this one upon a campaign of t.'ie
poor against tbe rich and labor against
capital.
In 1892, howeve r, the conservative lead
ers were able to hold the extremists in
chock. Mr. Cleveland, in his letter of ac
ceptance, took good care not to indorse
this radical cry of his party. He said in
his speech on receiving the notification of
his nomination: "Ours is not a destruct
ive party. We are not at enmity withrthe
rights of any of oar citizens. Wo are not
recklessly heedless of any American in
terest?." It was by that speech he rallied
to his support a large portion of the con
servative element of the country and was
elected President.
Men said then "the candidate is better
than the party." They believed Mr. Cleve
land to be strong enough and brave
enough to hold the lawless Democracy in
check. They did not foresee and could not
know that his party would soon break
away from him, and that his administra
tion would be rendered futile and disas
trous by the radical Democrats who ob
tained control in Congress.
In Mr. Bryan Democracy has a leader
after its own heart. So far from endeayor
ing to restrain his excited partisans, he
has done everything which words can do
to make tbat excitement greater still.
Under his leadership the war of classes
has been precipitated upon tbe people so
far as Democracy is able to precipitate it.
What will be the outcome of his leader
ship of the party it is not easy to foresee.
Certainly he will never be elected Presi
dent of the United States, but it is not
impossible that he may manage to retain
the leadership of his party and continue
to be a menace to the peace and well being
of the Republic
The dangerous leader of dangerous men
his course can hardly fail to awaken the
anxiety of true patriots. There is but one
way to deal with him and his followers.
All conservatives, all who are interested
in law, industry and social order, must
unite to make head against what if al
lowed to co on may become something
more than a threat. Democracy has found
its leader, and now the battle must be
fought in earnest all over the Union.
I favor that policy which will give
the largest development to every Amer
ican interest, that gives the widest op
portunity to every American citizen,
that gives the most work and best wages
to every American and secures
to our people the highest possible pros
perity in all their occupations. â McKin
ley. "â â  '.
THE CAUSE OF THE PANIC.
Nothing' of recent occurrence more
forcibly shows the value of extensive and
intensive advertising than the fact that
the Bryanites have by persistent repeti
tion led a considerable number of people
to believe that the depression of trade and
the disasters of industry from which the
country has suffered for the past three
years have been caused by the demonetiza
tion of silver in 1873.
The facts of our present condition and
those which preceded it are well known to
everybody. There was no depression in
trade prior to the election of Grover Cleve
land and a Democratic majority in Con
gress pledged to free trade. When Mr.
Harrison was elected and entered office
with a Congress favorable to a tariff re
vision in the direction of an increased
protective policy it injured no industry,
disturbed no business, and so far from
causing a panic had the good effect of
promoting all lines of trade. The contrast
between the effect of the election of Har- j
rison and the election of Cleveland was |
thus well and widely known, and yet in |
spite of that general knowledge persistent
iteration and reiteration have enabled the
extreme free silverites to rally to their
standard no inconsiderable number of the
American people.
Fortunately for the country, as Thomas
Jefferson has said, "Error ceases to be
dangerous when reason is left free to
combat it" All that the persistence of
the Bryanites can do has been more than
offset by the earnest activity of the more
intelligent portion of the community in
refuting their arguments by plain state
ments of the well-known facts in the case.
We have been, ever since the succession
to power of the free-trader 3, suffering
under an industrial paralysis, but for
fourteen years before that our prosperity
was the greatest the world had ever
known. The products of the country in
creased steadily, new mills -were opened,
new farms were tilled, new railroads con
structed and the wages of labor steadily
advanced. If the demonetization of silver
in 1873 was in any way the cause of the
depression that has come upon us, then
surely that cause was a long time in
making its effect known.
The intelligence of tbe country recog
nizes the futility of the arguments of the
Bryanites. JSo iteration or reiteration of
folly can lead them to lav aside tbe testi
mony of their senses and tbe lessons of
their experience. They know when we
were prosperous and when that prosperity
ceased. They know that trouble caused
by free trade cannot be cured by free
silver. Such a remedy, as Mr. Depew has
said, would be as foolish as if a man who
had swallowed a potato bug should seek re
lief by bwailowinga dose of paris green to
kill it.
I pat aside all this talk about the rise
of the value of silver under free coin
age to meet the value of gold, and all
the harmony that would come of the
marriage. There is absolutely no foun
dation for that faith in either history or
experience, and we have plenty of both.

INTERNATIONAL BIMETALLISM.
Senator Hoar, who has recently returned
from Europe, took occasion in an after
dinner speech at a banquet given in bis
honor, immediately alter his arrival
home, to make clear to the people of Mas
sachusetts that the issue involved in
this campaign is not a choice between tne
single gold standard and bimetallism, but
a choice between genuine bimetallism
based on international agreement and the
wild scheme of free silver coinage advo
cated by the Bryanites.
Alter pointing oat tbat the Republican
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, OCTOBER 19, 1896.
party at St. Louis declared itself for bimet
allism by international agreement, and
that the law of the land embodied in the
statute of November 1. 1893, asserts the
sarr.e doctrine, he went on to say that he
does not think it wise to let the men who
are menacing the good faith and integrity
of the Nation succeed in putting the Re
publican party and genuine bimetallists in
a false position before the country.
The most important part of Senator
Boar's speech was that in which he set
forth the reasons which he has for believ
ing that the Republican party will easily
succeed in bringing about an international
agreement for tha free coinage of silver.
On this subject he said:
Bismarck, who closed the mints of Germany
to silver in 1873, has declared in a recent let
ter that he has always been desirous to open
them again when the consent of other nations
could be had. The present French Assembly,
more than three to one, under the leadership
of M. Meiine, the Prime Minister, has declared
itself in favor of a resolution to the same ef
fect.
In England, while the prospect is not so en
couraging, it is well known thaf the great
financial leaders of the party now in power
are of the same way of thinking. Mr. Balfour,
tbe First Lord of the Treasury; Mr. Goschen, the
treat authority on all such questions; Mr.
Chaplin, one of the most eminent members oi
the Cabinet, and Sir William Moles worth, are
pronounced International bimetallists;
While thus declaring himself emphat
ically for bimetallism and giving reasons |
for the faith that is in him of the success
ful accomplishment of such an agreement
by the next administration, he was mo3t
decided in denouncing the folly of the
Bryanites who propose to establish free
coinage by this country alone. That at
tempt, as he went on to show, w oula in
evitabiy result in silver monometallism.
Gold â¢vyould go out of thfi country, the cur
rency would be restricted to that extent,
and disasters would result to commerce
and industry more terrible than any one
we bave ever known.
The speech of the eloquent and vener
able Senator from Massachusetts is most
timely in every respect. It comes as s lair
warning to the extreme gold- standard
men of the East that the victory which
is to be achieved at the polls this year will
be a victory for them. It will be a tri
umph for general bimetallism, lor the
principle of protection and for the main
tenance of law and order. The next ad
ministration will carry out the we!l-set
tled policies of the Republican party. It
will establish protection to American in
dustry, it will enforce the laws of tne con
stitution, and it will lead the Nation into
the paths of bimetallism from which bene
iits will result and accrue to all the indus
tries of the f arth.

PROTECTION AGAINST TRUSTS.
In that eloquent epitome of Republican
ism which constituted the salient feature
of Senator Tburston's address on his elec
tion as chairman of the St. Louis conven
tion no clause better deserves the attention
of the people at this time than that which
declared it to be the policy of the Republi
can party to provide for "the governmen
tal supervision and control of transporta
tion lines and rates, the protection of the
people from all unlawful combinations
and unjust exactions of aggregated capi
tal and corporate power."
So much has been said by tbe Demo
cratic orators and organs during the cam
paign of tbe power and trusts and aggre
gated capital to injure the business of tbe
American people, and so many efforts
have been made to induce the credulous
to believe that the Republican party ig
nores this danger to American prosperity,
that it ia well to recall the minds of citi
zens to the fact that the Republican party
in its broad and comprehensive system of
protection proposes protection against the
evils of trusts as weli as against the evils
of foreign competition.
Tbe Republican platform of 1888 con
tained the following declaration:
We declare our opposition to combinations oi
capital organized in trusts or otherwise to con
trol arbitrarily the Condition of trade among
our citizens; and we recommend to Congress
and the State Legislatures, in their respective
jurisdictions, such legislation as will prevent
the execution of all schemes to oppress the
people by undue charges upon their supplies,
or by unjust rates for the transportation of
their products to market.
There is reason to believe this resolu
tion was presented to the convention by
Mr. McKinley, who was chairman of the
committee on resolutions. There can be
no question that he is heartily in accord
with tbe sentiments expressed. All his
speeches and all the actions of bis life bear
witness to tbe fact tbat be is not only a
sincere, but a most intelligent friend of
American labor, and is on his guard
against everything which even threatens
to interfere with the best interests of the
American peoole. There can bs no ques
tion that under his administration the
anti-trust laws will be enforced, and those
evils which Mr. Cleveland has either fos
tered or neglected to oppose will be crushed
out of American life.
When men talk abont trusts they must
not forget that the greatest and most in
iquitous trusts of to-day are Democratic
trusts. The whisky trust is a peculiarly
Democratic institution. The Standard
Oil trust has araonj its supporters Mr.
Whitney, who came near being tbe Demo
cratic candidate for President. Moreover,
there is no single trust in the country
against which Mr. Cleveland's adminis
tration has made the slightest attempt to
enforce the law. The great coat trust,
which is to-day disturbing tbe East, finds
in Mr. Cleveland at least a silent ally. In
the face of these facts, open and notorious,
it is folly on the part of the Bryanite
organs to attempt to mislead tne people
into the belief that the Republican party
favors trusts or tbat the Democratic party
opposes them.
COAST EXCHANGES.
The Calaveras Chronicle boasts of being the
oldest weekly paper on the coast. Its publica
tion was commenced in the fall of 1851, and
it has jusi, opened its forty-sixth volume.
While the Chronicle, as its editor observes, may
be "scarcely a single-oared shell compared
with the big craft that ply the waters of the
sea of journalism," it is something, lor all
that, to be able to say that "the paper has been
published right here in Moketumne Hill for
iort;.-five years without missing an issue."
That the Chronicle has survived all these years,
almost since the dawn of California's State
hood, and is to-day healthy and prosperous,
is the very best evidence of its merits, and the
mention of such facts is the very best kind of
praise.
The Tracy Times has entered its fourth
volume. The publication is doing excellent
work in attracting favorable attention to its
locality. "When we started," says the editor,
"there were those who said, 'TLe Times won't
run a year.' But so far we have foo.cd them,
and, notwithstanding we do not receive the
support we are entitled to, we still exist, and
we hope to continue, and we believe the peo
ple will one day appreciate our efforts and do
for us what is right."
Messrs. Anson Wilson and Charles Cissna
have assumed the management of the Vancou
ver (Wash.) Register, a paper that was long suc
cessfully conducted byTnurston Daniels. The
only trouble with the Register is that it has
strayed from Ac path of sound and reasonable
politics and become wedded to the false doc
trines of Populism.
The Tulare R<gistcr suggests that if Califor
nia needs more leie days there is opportunity
to introduce a fruit festival, after the manner
of the Eustern corn carnival. These are great
occasions when whole communities get to
gether for a good time. It is a revival of the
ancient harvest home.
The enterprising town of Biggs has ample
reason to be Joyful over the success of its new
cannery. The following lines from the Biggs
.ilrpus contain a lesson that may be of profit to
other towns which, unlike Biggs, have not as
yet ;aken advantage of the same opportunities
to secure as many benefits as possible from
their resources: "The Biggs cannery is still
running alternate days, packing tomatoes, and
will not shut down until about the first of
next week. Ninety-nine employes are still on
the payroll and this number will continue un>
' til the closing day.
"The cannery has shipped about 15,000
cases, containing about 270,000 cans of fruit,
a large portion being forwarded to foreign
markets, and there remr.in in the warerooms
approximately about 20.000 cases of iruit and
tomatoes, which will be shipped as rapidly as
possible.
'â¢Taking all the circumstances into consid
eration the Biggs cannery has done remark
ably well for the first season's run. It has
packed more than the contract. promised, and
hundreds of people have beeD furnished em
ployment at fair wages who otherwise would
have been forced to do without many luxuries
aud necessaries had it not been for the estab
lishment of this cannery."
A mile or so east of Gridlev there is an ex
periment beine made which, if successful,
will be of great and lasting benefit to farmers
in California, and especially in this section of
the State. This is the production of hemp.
The following particulars, as given by the
Chico Chr tniclt-Rccord, are lull oi interest to
our agriculturists:
"An Eastern capitalist leased a tract of
about 200 acres of bottom land along
Feather River, and last wiuter planted the
ground to hemp. The crop is now being cut,
and the growth of the product is something re
markable when compared with that produced
in the Eastern States. That planted near
Gridley has attained an enormous height, a
great deal of it being about sixteen feet tall.
This is a great success when one considers
ihat the first three ieet of the hempstalk will
pay the expense of sowing, cutting, crushing
aud preparing the fiber for the market. The
hemp, alter it has reached the proper stage
for cutting, is mowed down with an ordinary
mower.
"It is then allowed to lie on the ground and
go through what is called rotting. After a re
quired length of time has elapsed the hemp
stalks are shocked up in a similar manner to
corn. It is then hauled to the crushing mill
where the stalks are run between two heavy
cog cylinders. This breaks up the wood in
the stalks which is afterwurd easily separated
from the fiber. This fiber when properly pre
pared commands a market price of between
7 and 8 cents per pound, and the cost of ship
ping is nominal compared with the selling
value. If this experiment proves successful,
and all indications are very nattering that it
will, we will undoubtedly see, in the course
of the next few years, hemp fields scattered ail
along our river bottoms."
The Hollister Bee has replaced the West Coast
Alliance in San Benilo County's capital. Harry
Johnson, tbe editor of the Bee, has had wide
experience in the newspaper field. The paper
is pot up ia good style, and is both bright
and newsy.
The Lodi Review- Budget contains several
very interesting items regarding wonderful
vegetable gruwihs in the vicinity of Lodi. For
instance, W. L. McDanlels raised a big crop of
potatoes on a small piece of land this year.
On July 10 the potatoes and vines had all
been cleared away and on the same ground
was planted a lot of marrow squash seed. Tne
paper says: "The crop 1s a sight. The ground
is uear.y covered with monster squashes, and
some oi them would take prizes at any agri
cultural fair. There is one which weighs
more thau 160 pounds, and 125-potmd speci
mens are plenty. Ob less than half an acre
of land Mr. MeDaniels will harvest from six to
eight toDs of squashes. A Stockton produce
dealer has offered Mr. McDaniels $150 for a
squash weighing 150 pounds or over, and will
take his entire crop at $8 a ton. Not less than
$50 will be realized from the second crop
oa this half-acre of land. Corn planted on the
10. h of July is already ripe, or nearly so, being
too hard for table use."
Here is a Lodi grape story: "D. McCoy, who
lives five miies souih, on the Cherokee Lane,
has two acres of black Ferrara grapes which
are turning out Wonderfully well. The shoots
were about a foot long when the fr.ost came,
April 18, and killed every one. They came
out again, however, and bore an immense
quantity of fruit, not less thau seventeen tons
to the acre.
"The cost to Mr. McCoy Is not over $5 per
ton when the grapes are delivered in market,
and as he receives 2 cents a pound ior tuem,
or $40 a ton, his net profit is !f35 a ton or $595
an acre. Two bunches brougni into this office
as samples, weighed .seveu pounds each."
And the Be ievi-BtLdget, as if not contented to
rest with the showing already made, astounds
us with a bean story, ior the truth of which it
vouches :
â¢â¢F. A. Jordan of New Hope planted this sum
mer four pounds of black-eyed beans, and from
that planting has gathered and cleaned up
eight sacks of beans of eighty-five pounds each,
a total of 680 pounds of beam lroai each pound
of seed." . ' 'â  â¢. ,- ' -.: â¢,â-,-

THE POOR AND THE RICH.
Atlantic Montniy.
But if the time is ever to come when the
poor and the rich are to be permanently ar
rayed against each other at the polls, it is not
yet come; for we have not passed out of the
period when the poor of to-day become the
rich of to-morrow. Although it assumes the
guise of the supremest danger, the present ag
itation ought to turn out, as it seems likely to
turn out, to be a farce ; no other fact is so con
spicuous in our recent history as the very
rapid increase in the number ol well-to-do.
If we roughly divide the population into the
poor, the well-to-do and the rich, and could
determine the number in each class at any
two gives periods, say in 1876 and 1806,
we should see that, while there has
been a large absolute and small
comparative increase alike in the number of
the rich and in tne number of the poor, there
has been an enormous increase, both absolute
and relative, in the number of the well-to-do.
Never since industrial society was organized
has there been such a general rise from pov
erty to comfort as there has been in the United
States during the last thirty years. There is
no more fallacious doctrine than that the rich
are becoming richer and the pour poorer.
The truth is that the lift from poverty to
plenty has so engaged our thought that we
have come too near to forgetting that other
things than material well-being are needful to
make a great people, and. we are now paying
one of the penalties of this Xorgetf illness.
AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
A number of successful miners and business
men from remote parts of the Yukon are at
the Commercial Hotel. Of these several have
put in a number of years at such far frontier
points as Forty Mile, Circle City and Tanana.
Some of these have not had a look at civiliza
tion as it exists in this country for over a
dozen years. They are therefore enjoying
their visit to the utmost. Some of the hardy
miners are bound to their Eastern homes,
from which they have been absent twenty
years or more.
Joseph Juneau, the founder of tne brisk city
of Juneau, is one of these. His former home
was in Wisconsin. Mr. Juneau brought down
with him, in addition to a good stake as recom

nuggets, which he was taking East with him

straw-colored beard, is also one of the most
popular in the throng. He pushed forward to
Circle City when it first began to attract at
tention, and went into business there. He is
said to be a great friend of the miners. Mr.
English is also identified with mining.
"The men who have reached here from the
gold mines in that country," said Mr. English
yesterday, "have as a rule done pretty well.
They like the country, notwithstanding such
hardships as they hÃve undergone. I think
well of it myself, and when I have had my
visit out here I will return. It is a good coun
try if men are adapted to it."

NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
The French corvette Duguay-Trouin, al
though nearly twenty years old, is still In a
fair state of preservation, and has been one of
the most useful' cruisers in the French navy.
She was built at Cherbourg and launched
March 31, 1877. The hull Is of iron, sheathed
with two thicknesses of planking of a total
thickness of eight inches. Her displacement
is 3140 tons, and the trial speed fifteen knots.
The armament consists oi five 7%-ineh and
three 5%-incb rifles, and tbe total cost was
$791,300. The Duguay-Trouin has been at
tached to the Asiatic station since 1884, ex
cepting one trip to France for necessary
repairs, and participated with great distinc
tion in the bombardment of Foochow Arsenal
December 24, 1884, in theÂ«Minin River, during
which the Chinese fleet of nine vessels was
totally destroyed.
The British cruiser Minerva, of 5600 tons
and 9600 horsepower, had her thirty hours'
trial at sea last month. Tbe vessel was down
to her designed draught and developed under
haii-power 4919 horsepower and a speed of
17.52 knots on a consumption of 1.7 pounds
of coal per horsepower.
Although the French were the fir9t to adopt
triple-screws to large vessels of war, the United
Btates was the first country to make a success
ot the system in the Columbia and Minneapo
lis. Germany also adopted the French idea in
the Kaiserin Augusta, but neither of the latter
vessels nor the French ship Dupuy de Lome
have come anywhere near the American
cruiser. The Dupuy de Lome was under con
struction about six years, and alter a number
of unsuccessful trial trips, during oue ot whioh
nearly twenty men were ljiled or badly
scalded, she was finally accepted. Tee K.ai
serin Augusta burely made twenty-one knois,
and after her return to Germany from the
naval review at New York it became neces
sary to strengthen the hull, which had shown
alarraing signs of structural weakness.

course of publication in England. Three have
already come out; the first, dealing with the
"naval administration" of Great Britain, past
and present, is from Admiral Hamilton, late
First Lord of the Admiralty. The second vol
ume, on the "Mechanism of Men-of-War, is
by Fleet Engineer Oldknow; the third, and
most interesting, on "Torpedoes and Torpedo
vessels," by Lieutenant Armstrong, gives a
succinct history of this modern part of naval
warfare of all countries. Nine more volumes,
treating on several matters connected with
the navy, are in course oi preparation.
The torpedo-boat destroyer Desperate, re
cently built by Thornycroft for the British
navy, had a final trial September 24, extending
over three hours, at which Â«he developed a
mean speed oi 30.18 knots. The boat had on
board extra weights to the amount of thirty
five tons.
Thornycroft is building a torpedo-boat de
â troyer, named the Albatross, which is to de
velop a speed of 32 knots. The vessel is to be
completed next autumn.
The lessons of the battle at Yalu and other
sea fights between Japan and China have
worked several changes in vessels subse
quently built. The substitution of metal for
wood as bulkheads and partitions and even in
furniture is one oÂ£ the results, and is not alone
much less dangerous from bursting shells ana
fire, but adds to the space and the sanitary
comforts of cabins and staterooms. In the
bauie-ship Deuischland of the German navy,
recently reconstructed, the woodwork has been
repl aced by steel and aluminum.

BIMETALLISM, NOT BI-STANDARD
ISM.
Dcs Homes Register.
In Minneapolis Mr. Bryan sought to use the
Republican platform ot four years ago against
the Republican party in this year's campaign.
Tne platform of four years ago affirmed the
doctrine of bimetallism. Well, Isn't that what
we bave, and isn't that what we propose to
continue to have? We now have bimetallism.
We have the only bimetallism which is prac
ticable. We have gold and silver circulating
side by side, in equal quantities and all as good
as the best. We bave bimetallism with the
gold standard. With Mr. Bryan's silver stand
ard we would not have bimetallism, except in
theory, for we would have no 100-cent gold
dollars circulating by the side of 50-ceni silver
dollar?. That is not the way money circulates.
The Republican party has nothing to take back
of what it said in 1892. Mr. Bryan simply con
founds bimetallism with bi-standardism.
That difference ought to be plain to all. In the
future, as in the past, we propose to have one
final standard, gold, and on that standard we
will circulate the two metals, gold and silver,
besides paper money. Could anything be
plainer^

AN INVALID'S HOLIDAY.
Magnificent Growth of the Institution
F(uided by the Rjv. T. W.
Brothertcn
The lord comfort him when he lieth sick upon
his bed. make thou all his bed in his sickness.â
Psalm 1x1:3.
It was like a holiday at St. Luke's Hos
pital yesterday â that is to say, it was as
nearly a day of rejoicing as can be had
anywhere when ono is surrounded by the
sick atid the dying.
The broad lawns in front of the main
buildings were given up to the visitors and
friends of the institution who came to
listen to the ceremonies in honor of the
hospital's twenty-fifth anniversary.
"Hospital day." which means so much
to those who have been i'l in health at St.
Luke's for years, was made more of yester
day than it ever was before, the Right Rev.
W. F. jS'ichols, D. D., taking cuarge of the
ecclesiastical oflices, assisted by the pastors
of numberless churches.
The balmy air of the Misiion warm belt
permitted many of the convalescents to
attend the services. Some were on crutches,
others in chairs, where they rested while
being wheeled around under the careful
eye of daintily attired nurses, and many
more stili ieebly worked their way among
the crowd, sitting down here and there,
coughing and in pain, but happy. The
sight of new faces, the opportunity of con
versing with tbe outside world that seemed
to gather around them on this occasion,
was such a rest from doctors, nurses and
medicines that they could not help but
fee) better.
There was one old lady in the throng of
visitors who was particularly interesting.
Perhaps it is not exactly right to place her
in that list, for she is essentially part and
parcel of the St. Luke's Hospital. The
widow's weeds she wears tell the story of
a death which claimed the best friend,
yes, the originator, of the St. Luke's
Hospital.
It was some twenty-five years ago that
Rev. T. W. Brotherton, who had been in
this country during an uneventful decade,
met a sick friend whose greatest fear was

that he would be sent to the City and
County Hospital.
"Not so!" exclaimed the reverend gen
tleman. "Not so long as I can help it
will you ro to a pujjiic institution."
On his way down the street Rev. Dr. T.
W. Brotherton met a generous-hearted
woman. Strange to say, her name could
not be remembered yesterday by Mrs.
Brotherton or others intere ted in the
hospital. To her he told the story of tbe
sick man, a member of the Church of Eng
land.
The charitable lady produced a $5 piece
with which to buy preliminaries and rent
a vacant house on the towering hill above
the present site of the hospital.
"That was the starter," said Mra. Broth
erton, yesterday, "in a few years $250,000
was secured and thi* non-sectarian hos
pital has been one of tbe greatest blessings
ever given the people of this State."
Fifteen years aco Key. Dr. T. WÂ«
Brotherton was stricken with paralysis
ana six years ago he died. Prior to this,
however, he built St. John*B Church and
started the Old Ladies' Home, of which
he was the chaplain.
Tbe officers at present of St. Luke's Hos
pital corporation are: President, C. V. S.
Oibbs; vice-president, Coionel G. A. Men
dell; secretary. William Doxey; treasurer,
Kirkham Wright.
T. c board of directors are: Right Rev.
W. F. Nichols, D.D., Dr. Middleton, Judge
Van Reynefjom, William Doxey and
George H. Powers.
Tbe resident physician, who has charge
of the sixty patients now in the hospital,
is Dr. R. B. Davy, who, with his associates,
has placed it in a most flourishing condi
tion financially and otherwise.

SPECIAL SERVICES HELD.
Rev. J, R. da Wolfe Cowle Preaches
at St. Luke's on the Avenue.
At St. Luke's Episcopal Church, on Van
Ness avenue and Clay street, the day was
observed in a special manner. On St.
.Luke's day all members of vhis parish
gather at the church for evening service
and the pastor gives an account of the
year's work. This old-established custom
was observed last evening.
The pretty little church wa3 well filled,
and in the audie.:ce were many of the
prominent fashionable people cf San Fran
cisco. Rev. Mr. Moreland, the rector, read
tbe yearly reports, which showed a re
markably active congregation had been
busily occupied during the past year in
doing good in a mulutude'of ways.
The poor and sick of the parish had
been well looked after; young ladies of
the congregation had given much of their
time to work connected with tbe church,
and nearly all the parishioners had en
tered with enthusiasm into an exchange
and correspondence society, through
which many peopie in the country and in
hospitals were supplied with reading
matter. Besides, the various societies of
juveniles, young people and older people
of St. Luke's were all In a flourishing con
dition at the end of tbe year.
The Key. J. R. de Wolfe Cowie of St.
Matthew's, San Mateo, delivered a brief
but eloquent sermon. He congratulated
the congregation on the reports read by
Mr. Moreland, and he realized that this
was a line on which the congregation was
striving to promote Cnrist's church.
"We are getting out oof. f parochialism," he
said, "and we are beginning to feel that
we ar-j a branch of the great Anglican
Catholic church. We are part of the great
national church of America. The human
race is beginning to realize that there is
joy in the world; men and women are
linding that which gives living lasting py.
They find it in the church of Christ.
America owes reparation to Africa for the
slave trade. Does not Great Britain owe
it to China for sending opium into China?
Does not European civilization owe it to
japan fur sending agnosticism and mis
believers inrb Japan? Nothing can do
reparation for what Americans done to
the Indian."
The preacher said that this coming
Chri9troas will be virtually the beginning
of the twentieth century, as the calendar
does not begin till four year-> alter the
birtb of Christ. He declared that men are
forming their battalions for Christianity
and God is pointing out the way at thid
great epoch.

called attention to Christian responsibility,
that no Christian, man or woman, was free
from the obligation to active service in God's

The Executive Takes a
Part in the German
Festival.
The Big Pavilion Made to Look
Like a Wild Woodland
Glade.
WAS A FINANCIAL SUCCESS.
Over Four Thousand Dollars Cleared
for the Two B nevolent and
Charitable Societies.
The closing night of tbe grand Prome
nade Garden Concert under the auspices
and for the benefit of the German General
and Ladies' General Benevolent Societies
was a brilliant success socially and other
wise. The vast central court of Mechanics'
Pavilion was filled to overflowing with
the wealth, beauty and chivalry of San
Francisco's German population.
The place, beautifully blocked off with
reowood and evergreen, was an ideal
garden. Dainty white-capped, white-
aproned fraulines flitted like so many
fairies through the various refreshment
booths, serving "zwei" beer with tbe
promptness of regulars, bat the grace of
innocence.
At 9 o'clock Governor Bndd made bis
appearance, accompanied by Dr. Morse, J
B. Reinsfein and fci. Bersinger. An in
formal reception was held in the secre
tary's office, after which a grand prome
nade was instituted, the order being as
follows: B. Brummel, 8. Bundscben,

stein, 8. Bessinger, William Herrmann,

Dr. D. W. Montgomery, Dr. William A.
Martin, Dr. B. MacMonagle.
During the marcn Hinrich's orchestra
played "Hail to the Chief," the people
cheered and Governor Budd kept up a
continuous bowing until the iriendiy folds
of the redwood behind which was the
banquet table concealed bis form from
view. The Governor made a neat little
speech felicitating the two societies on tbe
noble work they bave accomplished.
During the evening the orchestra ren
dered the following selections:
March, "King Karl" (Eilenberg); overture,
"Rlenzl" (Wagner); waltz, "Wine, Wife and
Sonc" (Strauss); overture, "Freischuetz"
(Weber); paraphrase, "Loreley" (Neswadba);

cially, the finance committee estimating a
clear profit of something over $4000.

The Tiburon and the Sausalito had an
other trial of speed yesterday. On tins
occasion the boat from the English colony
got the better of it and she was away
ahead when the mark on Alcatraz was
reached, (japtain Wilson is very proud of
his boat, but nevertheless he has no right
to do more than say that she can hold her
own.
Captain Morgan of the British ship An
drosa and Ben Scouler, tbe well-known
shoe dealer, *re now among the
ranks of the Salvationists. Yesterday
mere was a big meeting aboard the ship.
Seaman Staffsudd waa in charge of the
meeting and he made quite a number of
converts.
Yesterday afternoon there was a large
meeting of sailors on the Androsa and in
consequence the vessel was crowded from
stem to stern when Mr. Scouler addressed
the men on the forecastle.
Staff 3udd is a member of the army. He
joined the Androsa in Sweden and has
been ever since "converting.' 1 "Only two
men have deserted since the ship sailed for
San Francisco a year ago,' 1 said he yester
day, "i never went to sea under a better

The steamer Caroline brought down 200
bales of sugar-bags from San Quentin yes
terday. They will go to Honolulu on tbe
steamer Australia, and from the various
Hawaiian ports they will be used in the
sugar trade between Honolulu and San

one, but every sacK that leaves here on the
Australia means just so much more money
in the treasury when the steamer gets back
again.
Captain Leale of the Caroline says that
the sugar-bag business is going to be a big
one on the front next month.

DON'T YOU WANT TO FREE ' YOURSELF
from the stealthy serpent which is slowly
eating away your strength
Every man has sown his wild oats to some
extent before he reaches the age of manhood,
and there is in every man more or less of the
effect of his early dissipations. ; .
You yourself know better than anybody else
how weak you are. You have felt the ravages
of nervous waste : in your body, and you know
that sooner or later it will show In your face.
It is the serpent â nervous debilityâ
slowly takes from under you the very founda-
tion of ; your nerve-powerâ your manhood.
Destroy itâ cleanse your system of its presence.
You' can do this with electricity.
- Electricity is the life of the nerves. When
the nerves are filled with it there la no chance
for disease to exist. If you will charge your
nerves with electricity you can drive ! out for-
ever the serpent that is slowly destroying your
life. ,
Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt, the ideal ot all
progressive physicians for restoring wasted
strength, has made thousands of men happy.
It has reclaimed their strength and set a new
standard of vigor.

FRATERNAL BONDS
Order of the Eastern Star.
, Another of the grand officers of the term that
Is drawing to a close is Mrs. Carrie L. reaslee
of Pasadena, the worthy grand matron. Dur
ing her term of office she has been an active
worker, has visited ail the chapters in the
southern part of the. State and also came to
visit those in this City, In Aiameda and some I
In Sonoma, and on her return to her home
called on the chapters in San Jose and those
on the line southward toward Pasadena,
Wherever she went she was gladly welcomed
and by her kindly disposition has won the
hearts of all who have met her and who have
worked with her.
Grand Secretary Kate J. Willats has for sev
eral weeks past been busy preparing all the
documents which will have to be presented at
the session of the grand chapter that will com
mence in Golden Gate Hall to-day. The ar- ,
ranging of all the accounts of the many sub- 1
ordinate chapters requires a great deal of 1
time, patience and a . comprehensive knowl
edge of the affairs of the order. The previous
reports issued by the grand secretary show
that she is in possession of these qualifica
tions, for there is no fraternal order that pre
sents a more detailed and comprehensive com
pilation of proceedings than does the one she
prepares shortly after tho adjournment of the
grand body.
The City chapters of the order will give an
annual reunion in Golden Gate Hall Wednesday
evening for the benefit of the Masonic Widows'
and Orphans' Home.

tertain the Grand Chapter, ivy Chapter will ex
emplify the. work and a banquet to be given by
the three chapters will follow

officers one evening during the week.
On Thursday evening the officers of the Grand
Chapter will exemplify the work.

retary last week were Mrs. Mary T. Itean of 1
colusa, grand treasurer: Miss Jennie B. Bell of j
Shasta, grand Esther; Mrs. < lara Shields of Eu

For Congress, the Favorite of
the Occasion.
A reunion and picnic of the A. O. H.
Board of Erin was held at Harbor View
Park yesterday for the benefit 01 the Penn
sylvania mine sufferers. It was a t.ood
old-fashioned meeting among the people
who can never forget their native emerald
isle. They brought their families and en
joyed themselves to the fullest extent.
Young men and women danced the after
noon away in the pavilion, while the old
folks sat in the arbors and talked. In one
part of the grounds a fiddier, the successor
of the wandering minstrel of olden days,
played jigs and hornpipes, while lively
heeled dancers kept time to the sprightly
melody.
There were races in wfiich the very ama
teur sprinters sprinted around the track
lor the stuall prizes and principally for
glory. The first contest was for boys be
tween the ages of 10 and 12 and tive youn -
sters speeded for the lead. Johnnie Blen
erhassett won the first prize ami Milton
Hoffman the sec nd. The second contest
for little girls was won by Louise Miller,
whose prize was a silver pickle-dish, and
Maggie Conroy, who carried away an order
for a rive-pound box of tea.
The third race was run by six young men
for prizes of a keg of lager and a box of
cigars. The contest was amusing and in
teresting from the fact thai all of the en
trants put la the time during their run in
pulling each o.her back.
Peter Conroy managed to extricate Dim
self from the hurly-burly to get in first.
James Cialvin succeeded in following him.
Antone Livery, in the straggle, fell on the
track and the other two rolled over him.
He entered a protest, but was bought off
with a minor prize. Tiie fourth race was
won by Dau Sweeney, with Thomas Ward
second.
In the starting of the fifth race there
was a real contest. It was for young la
dies, but Mrs. Mary Kearny, a jolly old
lady, insisted on taking Dart. She was
younger than any girl on the ground, she
said, and stood on her rights. S:>e was
finally permitted to take part in a race by
herself against time ior a paper of tea.
The young ladies' race was won by Mrs
Joseph RoDinson and Mrs. Nora Callahan.
The lasi race, ior men, was won by Willis
Tread well and Frank Maricey.
Several of the candidates were in atten
dance, notably Thomas B. O'Brien, Re
publican nominee for Congress. When
he entered the pavi'ion dancing stopped
i and all united in cheering the popular
I candidate.
"1 am seeking your suffrage," said Mr.
j O'Brien when called upon for a speech,
"upon business principles. My opponent
is soliciting your votes upon theory and
the un-American principles of free trade
which he Â»o ndmirabiy represents. During
his term of office we have lost 16,000 men
and women, all ol whom have been
turned into idler? by reason of Demo
j era tic doctrines. We have also lost in our
I annual output of products $79,000,000 per
1 annum. Me has given to us a sand lot at

TO WATCH THE COUNT.
Citizens' Chartt-r Association Will Se
cure Watchers and Detectives.
The special committee appointed by the
Charter Association for prov.ding ade
quate measures for watching the vote and
count on election day met in the offices of
the association yesterday. Tiie committee
decided to adopt most vigorous measures
ior providing watchers and detectives and
convicting those caught in the act of
cheating at the polls. It was decided to
accept ihe co-operation in this wort of the
Merchants' Association, the Charter Asso
ciation, the Wheelmen's Municipal
League, the San Francisco Association of
Improvement Ciubs and the Non-Partisan
committee. About 2000 notices and postal
cards were ordered istu-d to the members
of ihe:-e various organ. z*tions asking them
to furnish Tenable persons to watch the
count and to state how long they woul.i
serve as well as what compensation they
would xpe< t.
The committee decided to engage four
reliable watchers for each of the 613 elec
tion booths in the City, which would
make 1252 watchers. It was decided to
have this force of watchers thoroughly
organized and disciplined. They will
bear badges from the Registrar's ortice
entitling them to free admission to the
various booths in the City. From tue
hours of 12 10 6 in the morning it was de
cided, if necessary, to double the number
ol watchers.
The guarantee fund of $4000 will be
largely increased and used ,or the pur
pose of offering large rewards for the de
tection of any person caught in the act of
cheating on election day or in the count
of the ballots. The ab>est criminal law
yers in the City will be engaged by the
a-sociation to insure the conviction of any
offender, and the entire resources of the
association will be used in landing any
guilty party behind the prison walla.

Explanation.
The arrow flies with the wind. : The top figure*
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
days; those underneath it, If any, the amount of !
rainfall, of melted snow In inches and hundredtbs,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines,: connect poln s of equal air pressure; Iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hitrh" means hl?h barometric pressure and
Is usually accomoanied by: fair weather: "low"
â r* fers to , low i pressure, and ' is : usually, preceded
and accompanied by: cloudy, weather and rains.
"Lows" ' us ally - first appear' on the Washington
ccasi... When the pressure is high In - th* interior
and low along the coast, and the Isobars extend
north and south along, the coast, rain is probable;
;.but when the. "low" Is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon la improb
able. With a "high" in Ihe vicinity of Idaho, and
. the pressure falling to the California coas'. warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result. . . ;

BE RECONCILED
Contention Between Seekers

Christians.
Every Element of Oakland So
ciety Interested in the
Present Struggle.
CHINESE FAITH IN BRYAN.
A Recent Sensation That Was Ex
ploited Abont Two Years
Too Late.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
COS Broadway, Oct. 18. j
Oakland must now decide whether she
will be a metropolis or whether she will
rest contented to be an adjunct to the
larger city across the bay. The question
is one that has two very clear sides to it,
each supported by an influential element
of society, between whom reconciliation
is impossible. During the past week
affairs have been rapidly approaching a
crisis, and it will have to be fought to a
finish between the Ministerial Union, the
Supervisors, the Christian Endeavorers,
the Merchants' Exchange, the Board of
Trade and the racetrack people during
the coming month. There can be no
metropolis on this side of the bay so long
as the narrow-minded policy exists that
has characterized the municipal govern
ment and to certain extent tbe county
government during the past four years.
No one can aoubt the honesty and integ
rity of all parties and individuals con
cerned in the present struggle, but every
one who possesses a moderate share of
intelligence can see that the day of de
cision has been reached and cannot longer
be avoided.
On the one hand are the Ministerial
Union, the Sabbath Observance Associa
tion (beaded by a truly good manâ Rev.
Dr. McLean), and the Christian Endeavor
unions, and on the other Bide are the
Merchants' Exchange, the Board of Trade,
the Seventh-day Adventists and members
oi the Hebraic faith, the street railroad
companies (who own parks and give free
concerts on Sunday) and the Racing As
sociation. Several leading merchants and
merchants' organizations have been stat
ing their side by resolutions and other
wise during tbe week and to-day several
ministers have bandied the matter from
their pulpits. The ministers declare that
they do not want a return to the old blue
laws, but only an enfoiced moral observ- j
ance of the Sabbath. Tbe merchants as
sert that they are not in favor of pool-sell
ing, but they want and must have all the
legitimate trade they can divert to this
city.
More, a new side issue has been brought
forward and will, it is understood, be !
formally launched to-morrow night. The
Christian Endeavorers, and they are cer
tainly the balance of power in the county
in any .natter that goes before the elect
ors, are 10 discuss whether the merchants
have not been rather hasty in indorsing
the racing association and whether it is
not the duty of Christians to patronize
those who do not favor horse racing. This
is a very sorious aspect of the case, for
nearly every merchant belongs to one or
the other of the two mercantile associa
tions, and to withdraw business from
them means simply that trade must be
carried to San Francisco.
A good deal of quiet work is being done
among the candidates for the offices of
Supervisors, but experience has proved i
that pledged Councilman and Supervisors |
are the readiest of pledge-breakers. Pre- I
vions to the last municipal campaign, the
Sunday -closing Association (which has
not been beard of for a year) extracted j
promises from a majority of the council- 1
men that they would pass a Sunday-closing i
ordinance. Being politicians, the prom- i
ises were readily made; beine men of j
business, the pressure of other business
men induced them to break their pledgos
just as readily after election. There is not
the slightest reason to suppose that any
better brand of consistency exists among
the Oakland politicians than was exhibited
two years ago.
All these questions can only be decided
by the people. The Supervisors cannot do
it, neither can the merchants nor the min
isters. If Sunday balloon ascensions are
made illegal by ordinance, the people
who now patronize them will go to San j
Francisco and spend their money. If ;
racing shall be prohibited the patrons of
the track will not spend their money
here. But in any event legislation is use
less either as a preventive or incentive. If
the people do not want Sunday concerts,
saloons and racetracks, these ventures will
soon have to close up for lack of patron- j
age. If the people do want them nothing
will prevent them from satisfying their
tastes. The people of Aiameda County
are not of the kind that can be mads
moral by legislation, nor will any one ele
ment submit tamely to tbe dictation of
another element. As has been proved be
fore, they realize their individual rights
and will be guided accordingly, mer
chants, ministers and supervisorial
pledges, notwithstanding.
It is a mistake to attempt to settle such
questions at an election, as they are purely
matters to be settled by tbe conscience,
the dictates of which each individual has
an inalienable ripht to accept and follow.
There is a certain Chinese concern in
this city which has lately started in busi
ness under circumstances that electors
who are following every kind of doctrine
would do well to consider. There is a
boldness and a Bryanesque flavor about
the circulars which they are mailing to
every home that is a little unusual. In
soliciting patronage they say that "only
neat Chinese clerks are employed," and
after a reference to the dearness of "white
goods" comes the information, "Made in
our Chinese factory in San Francisco, by
Chinese labor only." Surely there is a
little political moral in this, that even the
head of a local silver league can grasp.
A few days ago a story was given wide
publicity regarding the alleged cause for
the insanity of a young man who was
once a railroad employe. It was mnlti
iterated that he was driven insane by the
actions of some railroad officials who pre
vented him from getting work. The rail
road company has enough to answer for
10 damn it eternally, but truth is still the
truth. The facts are these. The poor
lad was pariially insaDe two years ago,
and was desperately anxious to marry a
young lady who didn't want him. He had
some trouble in Judge Clift's courtroom,
and attempted to shoot Attorney Aldrich.
The case was passed by on account of the
lad's mental condition. B. W. B.

OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. 18.â An innova
tion was made to-day at St. Paul's Episco
pal Church. Twelve young ladies in vest
ments and wearing mortarboard caps
were added to the choir. For several
years there has been a vested cbolr of boys
at the church, but in a few weeks they
will be entirely withdrawn and young la
dies substituted. The reason for the
change is that so much recruiting is re

Marched for McKinley and Hobart.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Oct. 17. -The Repub
lican parade to-night outnumbered any
previous attempt at a political demonstra
tion this fall. It consisted of the McKin
ley Drill Corps of this place, the Young
Men's Republican Club and the Fourth
Ward Clud of Oakland. The procession
marched down Santa Clara avenue to I
Sherman street, headed by a band of j
twelve pieces.
Encinal Hall, where tbe meeting was
held, had been handsomely decorated by
Messrs. W. H. Noy and George Lovegrove. j
The visitors were met by Messrs. E. A. j
Kober and C. W. Petig, and after the
specchmaking they were treated to sub- i
stantial refreshments. Hon. John P. Jack
son expounded the good old and sound
Republican doctrines to the great satis
faction of tbe audience. The ball was ;
packed to its utmost and many failed to
gain entrance.
Caught In a Frog.
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. 18.-* John H.
Mackay, a switchman, met with a fearful
I accident at the railroad-yards this alter- ;
1 noon. He was switching cars and was
j running across a frog to grasp a lever, j
when his foot caught and he was unable
to extricate himself before a car ran over
him. He was badly hurt, and several
bones were smashed. He is at Fabiola, in
a very critical condition.
WAITING IN SUSPENSE,
Unitarians Anxious for the Re
turn of Their Sign
board
Rev. Dr. Payne Delivers His Second
Sermon en Suffrageâ Inter
esting News.
BERKELEY, Cal., Oct. 18.â Rev. Ed
' ward B. Payne, pastor of the Unitarian
| Society, has written a communication to
i Professor Thomas R. Bacon, chairman of
I the Stiles Hall board of trustees, asking
! that the signboard of the Unitarian Soci-
I ety be replaced on the front of the hall.
As stated in a recent issue of The Call,
the Unitarians, upon renting a portion of
the building a year and a half ago, tacked
up a neatly designed placard on one of tha
pillars of the building calling attention to
the fact that services of the Unitarians
were conducted within. A request came
from some of the authorities in charge of
the hall asking for its removal, because
some criticisms bad been advanced against
i allowing the unorthodox Unitarians to
! occupy a portion of the university stu
dents' building.
The sign was removed and nothing was
said about the matter until a few days ago
when tie Christian Bible Seminary tacked
up its shingle. It has remained there
unmolested, while the sign of the Unita
rians lies in the basement among a lot of
empty boxes. This unjust discrimination,
as Dr. Payne calls it, has aroused an end
less amount of talk among Berkeley peo
ple. And so Dr. Payne has written to the
trustees asking that the sign of his church
be replaced. The church members are in
considerable suspense over the matter, as
the letter waa sent several days ago, and
no answer had been received up till to
night
Dr. Payne on Suffrage.
BERKELEY, Cal., Oct. 18.â Dr. E. B.
Payne of the Unitarian Society delivered
his second lecture on woman suffrage this

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, OCTOBER 19, 1896.
morning to the largest audience that has
assembled at Stiles Hall for many
months. His topic was "The Relation of
Woman to the Larger Work of the World."
Last Sunday he spoke on woman in her
domestic sphere, and next Sunday he will
speak more particularly on her enfran
chisement.
In his address this morning Dr. Paynp
said that the restrictions put on woman
were generally due to the attitude of men
on the subject. "This is shown," said he,
"in the first place when men claim exclu
sive prerogative in the wider activities of
life. This is illustrated by Dombey in
Charles Dickens' 'Dombey and Son.' His
spirit was to hold womanto her sphere.
"There is another class of men who do
not begrudge woman her lull share of
happiness in life, but think that her con
tact with the world would wreck her fem
inine qualities.
"Men have formed a distressing mental
picture of the female reformer, egotistic
and exacting, and make the stand for me
expected new woman. Such a woman is
a terror to ttiem."
Dr. Payne made an appeal to trust in
woman to find her own way, and to deter
mine her own part and deed. He held
that there should be no sex jealousy,
no suspicious guarding of prerogatives,
but a mutual trust and yielding grace on
both sides and a perfect union of purpose
and power to meet the common enemies
of life â hunger, ignorance and sin.
In closing his address, he drew a strik
ing parallel between the sentiment ex
pressed in the closing lines of "Paradise
Lost," and what shall be the relative
standing of men and women of the pres
ent day.
mission Work at St. Joseph's.
BERKELEY, Cal., Oct. 18.â The Rev.
Fathers O'Shea and.Mullane, the Redemp
torist missionaries,' opened a mission at
St. Joseph's Church this morning, with
services appropriate to the occasion.
Early mass was held at 7:30 o'clock and a
later one at 10:30. During the coming
week they will be held at 5:30 and at
8:30 A. m.
The sermon of instruction was preached
this morning at 8:30. To-night the ser
vices began at 7:30 and consisted of the
Rosary sermon and benediction.
Students' Congress Debate.
â  BERKELEY, Cal., Oct. 18.â The stu
dents' congress at the Siate University
will debate next Wednesday evening on
the following subject:
"Resolved, That a centralized form of
government, such as aimed at in the pro
posed new charter of San Francisco, is de

DEATH'S CURVE AT
LAST PROTECTED
Its Long List of Fatalities
Has Probably
Closed.
An Elaborate System of Sixteen
Pneumatic Gates Almost
Complete.
IMPROV* MENT CLUB HAPPY.
An Operator in a Tower Will Pro
tect Life and Property Night
and Day.
Oakland Office Saw Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Oct. 17. )
At last the Southern Pacific Company
has decided to place an elaborate system
of protection around Death's Curve. For
nearly thirty years the swift Berkeley
locals and the overland trains have been
killing travelers on the road crossings at
Death's Curve, but nothing has been done
to prevent fatalities till the present sys
tem was decided upon. Yesterday a
gang of men were working on the auto
matic gates and one-half of them are
already in place.
The system provides for four gates
where the trains cross the road leading
from the pier, four gates where the tracks
cross Bay street, four gates where they
cross a little unnamed street and the same
number at Cedar street. . In the little
triangular lot at the end of the pier a
tower has been erected, from which the
whole system will be worked. The oper
ator can see the whole length of the curve
from his elevated position and his sole
business will be to look out for all passen
ger and vehicle traffic as trains are ap
proaching from either direction. The
gates will be worked by means of com
pressed air.
Death's Curve is one of the most dan
gerous localities on the Southern Pacific
system. It is the curve that is rouuded
about every twenty minutes by the Berke
ley local. All the way and overland trains
swing around it as they approach or leave
the pier, and all freight trains must go
over it. Tne great danger has always
been that on account of the curve no one
could see a train approaching until they
were right on the track.
Children have been killed frequently,
wagons have been demolished and their
occupants mangled, and foot-passengers
have been found dead by the track times
without number. The Morgue records for
the past two decades can alone show how
many graves have been tilled through the
fatalities at the curve, but until this week
nothing has been done to prevent it.
The West Oakland Improvement Club
is highly pleased at tnis latest piece
of work by the railroad company, but
greatly regrets that it was not undertaken
sooner. After the system is put in the
total cost of operating will be the monthly
salary, about |65, of the towerman.
YOUNG WOMEN TO ROW,
Elaborate Plans for a Regatta
in Oakland Creek Thanks
giving Day.
Active Preparations Being Made for
the Christian Endeavor '97
Convention.
ALAMKDA, Cal., Oct. 18.â The prepara
tions for a Thanksgiving day regatta on
Oakland Creek are being pushed with
vigor by Commissioner S. J. Pembroke of
the Amateur Association, who promises to
have a day's sport that will long be re
membered, if it does not storm.
There will be senior and intermediate
races and outrigger skiff races. The latter
promise to be an interesting feature of the
day. There are eight or nine entries
promised, and ten if the Columbia Club
joins the Amateur Association before that
date. The Ariels, South Ends, Dolphins
and Alamedas will each enter two men.
In the junior sculls Brown, the present
champion, McCauslana, Duplissea and a
dark horse will enter.
Not the least of the day's attractions will
be a ladies' lour-oared barge race between
tnc San Diego team and a new team just
oreanized here. Already the Alameda
team are under the tutorship of a pro
fessional teacher, and they will give c
good account of themselves op the creek.
All efforts to induce the promoters to dis
close the ladies' identity have failed. If
â¢the Columbia enters the association a four
oar outrigger skiff race between them and
the U. C. team will bo arranged. The
latter may also enter the intermediate
barge race.
A Mass-Meeting.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Oct. 18.â The Ala
meda City Christian Endeavor Union is"
arranging for a grand mass-meeiing for
the latter part of next week, in the inter
est of the '97 convention, which meets in
San Francisco next y. ar. Edward Bur
rell has charge of the work, and Is doing
all he can to secure some able speakers for
the meeting.
MONTANA HORSES.
A Select String Owned by Marcus Daly
of Anaconda Arrives at
Ingleslde.
San Francisco is now the haven on
Which every horseman has his eye, and
every day sees new arrivals getting in,
either bookmakers or owners. Satuday
"Billy" Randail landed at Ingleside Track
with a string of five owned by the Mon
tana copper king, Marcus Daly. The star
of the stock is Senator Grady, at one time
looked upon by his folk to down the best
of the East 'He did- run some cracking
races among them, finishing second in the
American Derby won by Rey el Santa
Anna. Later he went wrong, proving a
disappointment.
The others in the string are: Friar,
Salvation, Ostler Joe and Senator Bland.
The latter will be remembered as the win
ner of the Farewell handicap decided over
the Bay District track, when he set the
coast record for one and a quarter miles at
2:07 flat.
E. R. Lowery of Chicago, probably with
out an equal as an auction poalseller, is
registered at one of the downtown hotels.
Mr. Lowery is somewhat of a bookmaker
as well, and may be persuaded to take a
hand in the California game.
"Gloucester" McDermott, "de man wid
do Steve Brodie dialect," came to town
the other day from San Jose with his colt
Waiter J, the aluminum three-year-old.
Time was when a mention of the colt's
name would cause trainers to see to it that
their feed stalls were securely locked, and
Jockey "Pop" Weaver to stop whittling
long enough to grin, but when he struct
that winning dip last spring the colt
would have brought a round sum. He
has developed into a grand looking horse,
and no doubt will add additional luster to
the name of True Briton at the coming
meetings.
INGLESIDE COURSING

from the Salvation Army headquarters

Christianity, and the happiness which it
brought.*

DERRICK TALKS POLITICS
Attempts to Criticise the Recent
Declarations of Arch
bishop Ireland.
Claims That the Love of Caiholics for
the Americaa Flag Is of Re
cent Growth.
"Archbishop Ireland Shows His Hand"
was the subject selected by Dr. G. H. Der
rick for his talk before the Good Citizen
ship meeting at Metropolitan Temple yes
terday afternoon. The speaker was inter
rupted many times by long and continuous
applause, particularly when he referred to
the priesthood in politics.
The meeting opened with a few general
remarks from Chairman Quitzow, in the
course ofwhich he said:
"The day will soon be here when we will
be called upon to show whether we have
profited by our coming together here for
the great length of time that these meet
ings have been held.
"If we have learned in what direction our
political strength should be exerted and
how-we should cast our ballot on election
day the object of these meetings will be to
some extent accomplished.
"The grave questions that present them
selves to be decided by the ballot on the
3d day of November are more important
than any that have confronted the Ameri
can people prior to and which the great
American Nation was called upon to vote
in 1860 and which Was finally settled by
the great contest that followed.
"The church in America is still in its
cradle, but the child is very dear to the
holy father," said Dr. Derrick in nis open
ing" remarks, adding "while Grandmother
Yorke rocks it to sleep." Continuing, he
said : "The first few words are Martiaelli's
greeting to America. Why ate we here
to-day? Because there are rights which
are vouchsafed to us by the constitution,
but is in danger from this baby in the
manger. Rome is carrying on a great
campaign against this movement. Five
years ago she said, 'the country is ours.'
Two years ago she saw a people uprising,
determined to throw her bacK to the old
world from which she emenated.
"Within the last few days statements
have come out which seem to matte the
blood of a true American run cold. I have
Deen threatened within the last few days
by anonymous letters warning me that I
had better cease ray utterances. I was
threatened with San Quentin, where I
could organize an independent A. P. A.
1 thought that if the time had come when
an American citizen could not speak his
mind the sooner I found it out the better."
The speaker then referred rather sar
castically to Father Yorke's contention
that as many Catholics had died in de
fense of the flag as Protestants. He ad
mitted' that many thousands had so died,
but he denied that it had been at the dic
tation of the priesthood. Dr. Derrick also
affirmed that the very paper now presided
over by Father Yorke had in 1860 and 1861
stood up for secession and rebellion.
"There are people in this City who know
this to be a fact, " added the speaker. Con
tinuing he said:
"Now comes this great and good man
Archbishop Ireland, who stepped from his
priestly robes and assumed the garb of a
private citizen. He said he wanted to
give in advice as a citizen. We don't
want any of that, however. The idea of
any man divesting himself of his religi
ous authority to speak as a citizen is pre
posterous. Now that is just the very
thing we don't want because the priest
carries the votes of those who believe in
him. I understand that Yorke does not
like this letter, but that does not cut
much figure. Ireland, you know, is so
much ahead of Yorke that he does not
count."
Dr. Derrick then undertook to analyze
the letter of Archbishop Ireland, though
he desired it understood that he was not
making a political speech. He referred
particularly to the archbishop's claim that
the platform adopted at Chicago tended to
disrupt the social order of things in this
country. The speaker applied the letter
to the local situation by saying that the
Woman's Liberal League was putting forth
its best efforts to defeat the new charter.
MUST HAVE SEWERS,
Residents of Holly Park and
Vicinity Demand Drain
age.
An Enthusiastic Meeting to Discuss
Hatters of Vital Importance
to Property-Owners.
The residents of the extreme south
western portion of the City have inaugu
rated an active campaign for a sewer sys
tem in their district. At present there
are no sewers beyond Holly Park avenue
and in the rapidly improving district left
unprovided for there is a growing demand
for drainage.
There was a meeting of the residents of
the district held under the auspices of the
Holly Park Improvement Club at their
hall yesterday afternoon. H. C. Wein
bolz, president of the club, acted as chair
man of the meeting.
After a brief explanation by Mr. Wein
holz of the object of the meeting repre
sentatives of neighboring improvement
clubs were called upon for expressions.
James P. Taohey of the Fairmount Club
voiced the desire of the orsanization
which he represented to work indus
triously toward the acquisition of a sewer
system. He called attention to tbe danger
of aewer funds being used injudiciously
and dishonestly. "Whenever the Fair
mount Club sees anything of that kind
goin;' on," he said, "we will immediately
call a halt."
Richard Rich enbach of the Holly Park
Improvement Club declared himself in

trie district. He thought it could not be
put in operation top quickly, and he advo
cated going before the Supervisors with a
petition at once.
Thomas O'Neil said that the City Engi
neer was already working on plans for a
sewer system, and if the improvement
clubs would work together they would un
doubtedly secure the system.
JOther gentlemen present expressed them
selves enthusiastically in the same strain.
Mr. Kroutch moved that a petition be pre
pared and signed by the secretaries of tbe
various improvement clubs interested re
questing the Supervisors to provide for the
drainage system needed. The motion was
carried unanimously.
Frank Conkilng, Democratic candidate
for Supervisor from tbe Eighth Ward,
spoke of the necessity of united efforts on
the part of the improvement clubs. He
gave some practical advice in regard to
organization and advised the members if
they saw fit to enter politics to see to it
that they indorsed such candidates as
would be true to their interests. In an
swer to a question he spoke in favor of
beautifying Holly Park. "
Representatives of the Precita Valley
and Nuevo Potrero clubs spoke of tbe re
sults which they had attained by "stick
ing everlastingly to it." This sentiment
was approvingly commented upon by sev

Central Park was crowded yesterday after
noon with people to see the baseball match
between the Stars of Nevada and Alerts of
Alameda. Up to the sixth inning the Alerts
had made two runs, but the Stars had failed
to score. In the seventh the Stars made it

THE TRANSFER
OF TROOPS.
Two Companies of the First
Infantry at the
Presidio.
General Miles* Successful Hunt
for Big Game in New
Mexico.
BE KILLED TWO LAEGE BE ASS
The Light Batteries to Go to Fort
Hamilton, N V., and Fort
Riley, Kans.
Last Saturday Captain Frank Thorp,
Light Battery D, Fifth Artillery, turned
over the command at the Presidio to Cap
tain Francis E. Pierce, Company G, First
Infantry. Captain Pierce will probably
command until the arrival of the lieuten
int-colonel of the Third Artillery. As
loon as General Forsyth returns to re
'.ieve Colonel Snafter as commander of the
department, the latter will take charge of
affairs at the reservation. Meanwhile
Colonel Shatter has directed that the rules
.fend regulations prescribed by General
Sraham shall not be changed.
The destination of the light batteries of
the Fifth Artillery has been designated.
Battery D, Captain Thorp, will go to Fort
Hamilton, N. V., and Battery F, Captain
Reilly, will go to Fort Riley, Kans.
Major General Miles was at Fort Riley
last Saturday. A regiment of cavalry, a
regiment of infantry and three light bat
teries are concentrated there for the pres
ent.
In a recent letter from New Mexico to
Colonel A. 8. Kimball, Chief Quarter
master of this department, General
Miles wrote: .'
We got two large bear in two days' hunt.
We rode 250 miles in the saddle and the last
fifty miles in four hours and twenty-seven
minutes. I managed to survive the generous
hospitality oi many friends in San Francisco
iua appreciate in the highest degree their
rood will and friendship. I had a splendid
time in Southern California. Los Angeles is
bound to be a great city.
Colonel Kimball has obtained from
Quartermaster-General Sawtelle in Wash
ington an allowance of $3600 for a new
bakery at the Presidio. It is to be lo
cated on the site designated for the
bakery in the plans for the new or im
proved Presidio. An expense of $1500
would be required to repair the old
bakery. So it was decided to put in a new
one. which will have a baking capacity
sufficient to supply a garrison of sixteen
companies..
The Presidio is at present garrisoned by
the two light batteries of the Fifth Ar
tillery and two companies of the First In
fantryâCompany F, Captain Starr, and
Company G, Captain Pierce. The guard
duty is somewhat onerous, but it is per
formed in the. usual manner. The First
Infantry Band is at the Presidio.
Captain Robert R. Stevens, assistant

REAL ESTATE
MARKET REVIEW
Few Transfers of any Im
portance Recorded Dur
ing the Week
Attention at Present Largely
Directed to Country Lands
for Grain Raising.
i âââââ
THE OCEAN SIDE HOUSE SOLD
Mrs. H nrietta I Selby Loaned $40,000
by the Board ol University
Regents.
Real estate brokers report that the demand
for grain lands has increased perceptibly since
the prices of wheat aud barley have gone up.
Many lessees are not alone apparent, but sev
eral transfers have been closed, and many
prospective buyers are looking over the field.
The value of the laud for such purposes has
also materially advanced, as it is calculated
that each advance of 10 cents a cental in the
price of wheat represents an increase of $5 an
acre in tbe land that produces the grain.
Nothing in the history of our aenculture is
more striking than the remarkable increase of
wheat-growing on the Pacific Coast, especially
in California, where tbe crop in 1850 was only
17,200 bushels, most of the grÂ«in consumed
being at that time brought lrom Chile. Both
soil and climate here are most favorable to its
culture.
Not alone the farmers and savings banks are
beneficiaries of the condition of affairs, but
every class of society, directly or indirectly.

Labor Commissioner Fitzgerald and his
secretary, .Mr. Dam, were introduced to
the convention. Later on Mr. Fitzgerald
participated in the deliberations of the
body.
The committee on resolutions presented
a report, which was accepted, and on mo
tion of Delegate Furuseth, considered by
the convention seriatim.
This committee met at 1159 Mission
street last Thursday, when W. Macarthur,
Guy Lathrop, Hy Meyer, F. Busse. C. E.
Hawkes and J. Hill were present. .Macar
thur was elected president and Hawkes
secretary and the committee proceeded to
consider the various bilis, recommenda
tions and resolutions referred the previous
Sunday by the convention. Its chief work
was, however, upon the proposed labor
laws compiled and recommended by Labor
Commissioner E. L. Fitzgerald.
Of these laws, bill No. 1, an act amend
ing section 3245 of the Political Code, pro
viding that eight hours oniy shall consti
tute a day's labor, was recommended
without amendment.
Bill No. 2, an act to provide for the
proper sanitary condition of bakeries and
the preservation of the health of the em
ployes vherein, was recommended with
the expunging oi phrases referring to the
Labor Commissioner's discretion in the
premises. The convention accepted the
recommendation and decided to add a
section providing for the appointment of
bakehouse inspectors by boards of health.
Bill No. 3, which provides for the pro
hibiting of awards of contract for public
work to persons having judgments stand
ing against them ior non-payment of
labor, was presented without recommen
dation other than the insertion of the
words "violation of contract or for" be
fore the words "the non-payment oi" in
the second last line of section 1. Furuseth
opposed it on the ground that it was of
ficial boycotting, and the principle in the
billâ blacklist, boycott â was a vicious one.
He moved that it be stricken out as a
whole.
The Labor Commissioner said it bad
been drafted from the statute books of
Washington. He appreciated the stand
taken by Mr. Furuseth, but the bill he be
lieved to be necessary on account of the
danger of straw bonds. He declared that
he had claims for labor done in street work
of this City aggregating over $100,000, but
because there was no lien law on public
work the laborers had to go hungry. In
reply Furuseth made a powerful speech
against tbe principle in the bill, and on a
vote the bill was rejected.
The next bill considered is a proposed
act to provide for a bond for the protec
tion of laborers on public work. The com
mittee recommended reducing the amount
of the bond reauired lor this purpose from
the full to one-fourth the contract price,
believing that this section as it stood
wou.d create great opposition from smaller
comractors.
It was a question in the minds of the
committee whether this would cover
street contracts; also whether section 3
would hold official bonds of officials liable
when officers were not personally respon
sible. This bill was re.erred back to the
committee tor amendment, with a view ot
including as far as possible the ground
sou'jht to be covered by tue preceding bill,
No. 3. The bill wilt be amended further
to apply to all public work.
The act (No. 5) to establish and support

Tree-Planting in Golden Gate Park This Afternoon.
At half-past 2 o'clock this afternoon the patriotic ladies of Sequoia Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution will plant thir
teen trees in the historic arch which has been laid out in what was the Forty-nine Camp of the Midwinter Fair, in Golden Gate Park, at the
point where stood the canvas of Mount Shasta. The spot is most accessible by walking down the main road to an avenue where the locations
for the trees have been marked by stakes and where a speakers' stand has been erected. There is to be an interesting programme. The
principals in the movement to have an arcb emblematic of the original thirteen States are Mrs. Peter J. Hughes of Merion Chapter, D. A-
R., of Pennsylvania, who originated the idea; Mrs. Henry Wetberbee, Regent of Sequoia Chapter; Miss Alma Priscilla Alden, the sec"
retary, and Mrs. S. Isabelle HubbarJ, the registrar of the chapter. A feature of the ceremony will be the planting by the registrar and
color-bearer of Valentine Holt Society of the Children of the American Revolution of a scion of tne Charter Oak, donated for the occasion
by Miss Marion Burgess Hough of Hartford, Conn.
a bureau of labor was referred to the Labor
Commission, who declared that the bureau
should be made a practical institution in
its workine. It, however, contained a
clause relating to a free-employment de
partment, as follows: "To exclude from
the office and enter upon a book kept for
that purpose the name of any person
whom he shall find to be unreliable, irre
sponsible or otherwise objectionable."
Furuseth here again saw the blacklist
and its danger* sticking out; for which
reason he protested against the bill. Com
missioner Fitzgerald a- cepted the objec
tion, which he said he believed to be well
founded. The objectionable clause was
expunged.
An act to define the dunes and liabilities
of employment agents<No. 61, referred by
the committte to the Labor Commis
sioner, was next taken up. The Commis
sioner read his report to the Governor on
this subject, and the bill was unanimously
adopted without discussion.
At the former session of the convention
the net fixing the minimum rate of com
pensation fur labor on public work at $2 a
day was presented to the committee with
the suggestion that "unskilled" be in
serted to qualify labor. The committee
recommended the bill without change,
which recommendation was unanimously
adopted.
The act (No. 8) to add to the political
code two sections regulating the hours of
labor of persons emplo3 - ed in bakeries,
limiting the time to ten hours, was re
ported unfavorably by the committee iv
the belief that it would be beyond the
power of the State to enforce the law if
passed. Action was deferred until the
next meeting, by which time there will be
an oi'inian on the bill from the Attorney-
General.
An act as proposed to enforce the prompt
payment oi the wages of laborers in law
ful money of the United States contained
a clause which the committee believed
was equivaL-nt to imprisonment fcr debt
due to labor. It waÂ» accordingly submit
ted for interpretation. This act deals
with payment of laborers in checks, and
it makes it a misdemeanor punishable by
a fine of $300 or imprisonment for thirty
to sixty days to fail to redeem time checks.
It was adopted with the insertion of a
clause excepting cases of insolvency from
punishment.
The act providing for the branding of
all articles manufactured in prisons was
generally held to be a most important one
to labor. The bill was referred back to
the committee for information on the ex
clusion of prison-made goods from the
State or compulsory branding of all such
goods coming into California.
Tbe convention adjourned until next
Sunday afternoon.
AT THE CHUTES.
The Relay J'.ace Endedâ A Balloon in
the Fog.
The relay race, to test speed in moving
pedals, which commenced at the Chutes
last Monday night, was brought to a close
yesterday afternoon. It was a 35-mile
race, five miles each evening and five yes
terday.
After the third race had been run. and
each awarded to the boys of the California
Club, the San Francisco Club's boys set
up a claim that the machines had been
tampered with and refused to proceed fur
ther. The California boys continued, and
the race was awarded to them, but they
refused to accept the cup that was raced
for, other than to bold it for a challenge.
The winners of individual prizes were:
Binlsall, five miles in 9:38, Hansen in 10:18
and Olsen in 10:30.
Professor Frank Miller made an ascent
from the grounds in a balloon, in the
presence ot a large number of people, but
in less than a minute be was lost in the
fog. He came down, uninjured, in the
German Host ital grounds.
Next Sunday Arion, who has crossed
the Niagara twelve times on a wire, will
appear at the Chutes and will ride a
bicycle on a wire, he and the wheel being

Bryan has been marked in Southern Cali
fornia during the past weett. A marked
defection from tue Bryan clubs in South
ern California has been reported and it is
believed that the rising price of wheat co
incident with the low price of silver will
drive many silverites into the camp of
protection.
In the same encouraging line cheerful
news comes from Or gon. Definite in
formation comes from Portland, Salem
and other points that thousands of Demo
crats, weary of Democratic experiments,
will vote ior McKinley., having keenly felt
the evils of free trade. '
Arrangements have been made by all
political parties for a number of spirited
meetines during the week at the various

General H. A. Pierce of Los Angeles
has arrived in this City after a stump
ing tonrof the great San Joaquin Valley.
The genera! visited many strange places
since be started on his canva3s. He
made it his special mission to wander
away from the line of the railroad into
the canyons of the coast range and of the
Sierra foothills, where the lumber man
lurketh in his lair and where the ex-wool
grower, formerly a Democrat, sits by his
hut on the bare hillside and curses his
late and the Wilson tariff.
Among these people General Pierce did
excellent missionary work.
" Everywhere I found the undercurrent
tending our way," said the general, "and
the tide has set steadily in the direction
of protection as the chief issue in this
campaign. This is true especially cf pro
ducers in the country, because protection
is a vital, tangible issue wit â  them."
More than 1000 people listened to General
Pierce in Oakland last Thursday night.
He is a forcibl > and lo?ical speaker and
has met with the most fluttering success.
He addressed a meeting in Ukiah last
night.

A Forced Armistice Holds the
Denizens of the Quarter
Quiet
MANY QUEUED TEBRORIZED.
The Tongs Are Even on Murders and
Are Locking for the Chinese
Consul's Scalp.
There is a condition of unrest among
the Chinese in this City. Tbe action of
the Chinese Consul who is supposed to
have obeyed orders from Washington and
caused the breaking up of a few high
binder headquarters, is an entirely new
departure in the warfare that has waged
for all these years, and it has added an
other element to the strife.
The Be On Tong and Be Leong Tong so
cieties, two factions in one same family,
have been at outs for more than a year,
each having murdered two of the other
branch's fighting men.
Under the ordinary rule observed by the
highbinders of the Kong Chow Associ
ation, to which tbese two tong families
belong, there would be declared an in
definite armistice. Not so in this case,
however, because each blames the other
as the instigator of the smashing-up re
gime which the Chinese Consul is believed
to have inaugurated.
Incidentally, the representative of the
Chinese Government here has surrounded
himself with all the safeguards at hand,
and it is as difficult these days to see and
talk to him as it was with the late
lamented Czar, when dynamite bombs
were supposed to grow on trees in Russia.
There is, therefore, every likelihood that
some celestial will be punctured by knife
or bullet very soon, and the Chinatown
squad of policemen under Sergeant Helms
has been re-enforced with a dozen detec
tives, ununiformed, under Sergeant An
derson, and a half dozen extrarnen under
Sergeant Price. A particularly careful
watch is being kept on the Chinese Con
sulate.
The Consul is said to be the friend of
the Sam Yup peonle on tins coast as
aeainst the See Ynps, who are more
numerous, although less wealthy. The
latter have recently undertaken to do
what tbe United States Government has
never been able to accomplish â that is to
get a census of the Chinese on this coa:-t.
Their purpose is to show that they â the
See Yudss â far outnumber the Sam Yuds,
and that they are entitled to have another
and friendly Consul here, or else kill the
one who is not friendly.
Tiiese Chinese have peculiar ways in
whicb to do business. Yesterday, when
Policeman J. H. Crowley weht into
an overall factory on Merchant
street, to serve a warrant on
Quong Ho for robbing Wong Sing in a
DuDont-street store some days ago, he was
surrounded by a score of threatening
heathens who undertook to liberate their
friend. Crowley managed to draw his
pistol and back out of the place dragging
his prisoner along with him. There was
no blood shed, but it was not that tbe
Chinese tried to stop the effusion.

cisco audience. Aside from "Romola,"
which is founded on George Eliot's novel,
all the other plays wnich the Tabers v.ill
present here are Shakespearean. No less
than six of these are to be presented.
Mrs. Taber alluded to them last night.
She and Mr. Taber had just got a little
rested after a hard trip over the alkali
deserts. It has been excessively hot there,
the trains were slow and this made the
trip doubly hard.
Notwithstanding this, however, Mr. and
Mrs. Taber were looking very well. They
have during their recent visit to Europe
spent a great deal of time in Florence and
other parts of Italy, and in England,
where Mrs. MarloweTabermadea specialty
ol studying Shakespearean tradit.ons.
"I think no other plays can equal these,"
the lady said ; "we always go back to
them, no mat'.er what may change us for
the moment. They are a perpetual spring.
I find that no matter where I go, to the
great city or to the frontier, the people all
like and appreciate them. The people of
the wilds are as quick to see ami applaud
the great points in them as any other.
"We had no adventures while en route
from New York, but while crossing the At
lantic on La Burgogne the steamer was
enabled to pick up another vessel, as you
have, perhaps, noticed by the tlispatches.
Though I understand the political contest
is oeing waged warmly here, I think it is
npthing to what it is in the East, where
bands and processions are parading all the
time, and where speakers on one tide or
another are holding the attention of great
crowds.
"But as theatrical people do not have
the local interest to appeal to them which
appertains to others, they cannot be said
to be absorbed in politics as others are."
On the completion of the two weeks fur
which the Tabers are to appear here they
will go south.

great that no one need be left out of its
influence."
