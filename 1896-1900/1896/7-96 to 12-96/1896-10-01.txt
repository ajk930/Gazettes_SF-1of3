east of the gi. and is to the effect
that Cedar Keys uai oeen swept away and
many persons killed and injured.
This report reached Gainesville by
courier from Williston, which is twenty
miles north of Cedar Keys. The report is
hardly exaggerated, as Cedar Keys was
directly in the patti of the hurricane and
received its full force as it leaped raging
from the gulf.
After demolishing Cedar Keys the
storm, moving in a northeasterly direc
tion, struck Williston, a village of 400 in
habitants. At that place eleven houses
were wrecked, one person was killed and
fifteen injured.
Near Williston it a large turpentine
farm, on which many State convicts are
employed. Twenty of these convicts were
huddled in a cabin across which the storm
blew a great tree, crushing six of the in
mates.
Leaving Lavy County Â» the hurricane
dashed across Alachua, one of the most
populous counties in the State, where a
number of persons were killed and many
more severely injured.
At Fort White, in Columbia County.it
is reported that six persons were killed,
but the report has not been confirmed.
From Columbia County the hurricane
-lashed across Duvall, its edge striking
Jacksonville, but doing little damage and
causing no loss of life.
In Nassau Gounty, however, just north
of Jacksonville, the hurricane seemed to
gather additional force and did awful
work.
At Boulogne, the schoolhouse, in which
were over thirty children, was wrecked
and five children killed. Miss Ada Stew
art, tne teacher, escaped with a broken
arm. Liiiia Raines, a 12-year-old girl, ran
from the schoolhouse just before it col
lapsed and hastened to her home. As shs
entered the house it was wrecked and the
child was killed. Harry Johnson, who
was with her, was also killed and Mrs.
Raynes was fatally injured.
At Hilliards the schoolhouse was
wrecked and four children were killed.
At Kings Ferry, on the St. Marys River,
Andy Johnson, Moses Adler, Simon Hen
derson, Mary Jones and her child, all
negroes, were killed.
Mrs. Fisher was nursing a sick child and
the infant died as the house collapsed.
The mother escaped.
Two schooners, loading lumber at King's
Ferry, were blown from their moorings,
and landed in a marsh, three of the sailor

the line, killing four people.
Folkston, Ga., near the Florida line, was
also struck, the schoolhouse being wrecked
and four children killed. It is impossible
to accurately estimate the property loss of
Florida, but conservative men say it will
exceed $2,000,000.
At Lacrosse fifteen buildings were de
stroyed. Rev. W. A. 3arr, Mrs. F. F.
Mclntosh and her baby are reported
killed. Near there ibur laborers, who
were in a cabin at the turpentine farm,

of the cyclone. It was blown along the
track and then off a distance of fifty feet,
and every person in it was badly injured.
Steve Mason and George Johnson have
since died.
At Grady, a small place, twelve houses
were blown down. A woman was killed,
but a babe at her breast was unhnrt, al
though it had been carried some distance
by the force of the wind.

Lbs AKGELEB, Cal., Sept. 30.)
Alva Udell, secretary of the provisional
committee for the reorganization of the
Los Angeles Democracy, has addressed
the following letter to the Democratic
State Central Committee:
. ;;i To the Chairman of the Democratic State Central
Committeeâ SiÃ.: In i a recent letter 1 I advised
you that the provisional committee 1 ; for the re
organization *of I the Los Angsts t Democracy
had* resolved a that ihe State Committee, of
which you are chaljmnn, be respectfully re
quested by appropriate action to call for the
resignation j of, Stephen M. Wh'.te as .United
States Senator, to the end that a Democratic
' Governor may appoint a . worthy Democrat to
fill the vacancy * thus - created. We again in
' sist upon such action by your committee. If
godlessness consists in being inconsisent then
' Stephen M. White.f* godless indeed. He was a
member of the Congressional District Conven
â  tion : that recently nominated H. \\. lutton as
', a candidate lor Congress in this district. After j
the ; convention 'had taken 13Oballot\in a tie
j vote for , two other candidates Mr.' PatUn was
named as a means of dissolving : the deVdlock."
\ When his name was' mentioned his opponents
' in the convention suggested Charles A. mrlow
as the most available candidate;: It was then
I that Mr. White ' laid before his confreres a true
I word picture of the socialistic nominee. \
r - In measured 'i language v i the ; Senator \ de
nounced Barlow in the most vehement terms;
yet this same Stephen M. White, wholly disre
garding his"duty as a? Democrat, if he be ore,
and unmindful 'of the obligation he owes to
the Democracy, has sine â¢ brought Mr. Barlow
before a county convention of the late Demo
cratic par ty â  of " this court / tnd insisted J that
it was the duty of all fowl IÂ»eiriocrÂ»tÂ« in this
I flilstrlct to" en PWrfd'^lSk:?. : Ak,\ f Â«; ; Chi trie* "a.'

Bar lei <r did not profess ie be "a Dem bcrat.S' ' ' * I
â¢ The Senator to one Ml of delegates aubsUa-
declared * that Bsrlow ;.' Is unworthy of
confidence, and then, i~ lesi than thirty days,
presents Mr. BarVNw to 'another set of dele
gates, saying in substance that Barlow is good
enough for sincere Democrats to vote for.
As Barlow is the fawning i protege \of T. V.
Cator, whose henchme^ demand that White
support the I socialistic nominee, the Senator
takes bis political mcd ;ine, say's it is the best
that can be had, and d Clares : that f Barlow is
his candidate for Com ress. ; It, therefore; be
comes painfully] evicre t that Senator White
and his hÂ» Vichmen are urposely aiding Cator
and his faction of soci ists to ; humiliate the
Democracy, and that n ther will permit any
thing to stand ,in Â» th way of the deal by
which Cator and "Out Steve" are trying to
' elect each otner to the Inited States Senate.
' This pair of intrigu 3 statesmen have an
obedient servant in Ci rles A. Barlow, who in
this city has recently < clared that, if elected
to Congress, he would i directed by the para
mount wisdom of the I nator from Los Ange
les.';- Mr. White is prof >edly a Democrat, and
was a Cleveland cuckc until he got the Fed
eral offices in Californ ; Mr. Cator is a Popu
list, a socialist, a nut lalist, a revolutionist,
or anything : else to g< into the United States
Senate; and , both hoi to succeed by fusion
and i machine manipi 1 tion of '. the Populists
and Democratic parti* \ , :V.
The greater intellect of the State.Jthe cmi- J
nent jurists and publicists among our dis
tinguished men. the more- profound of the
towering statesmen of our commonwealth, are
to be turned down, to give place and position
to this pair of intriguing politicians. The
Senatorial election hangs upon the throw of
their loaded dice. The game is made and,
without reference to the question of fitness,
capability or other qualifications necessary to
a proper and honorable discharge of their offi
cial duties, the socialistic candidates from
Congressmen down are programmed, and their
socialistic bosses boldly announce to thou
sands of sincere and deserving Democrats: "It
is heads we win and tails you lose."
In marked contrast to Mr. White as a con
sistent and veracious gentleman stands the
organizer of the dying People's party, the
Hon. Marion Cannon, who has retired from
Congress to the tranquil pursuits of private
life, but who will stand by the truth though
the heavens fall. Mr. Cannon writes as fol
lows: "When in 1892 I entered San Luis
Obispo County on my campaign Mr. Barlow
and his friends came to me and begged me to
assist him or he would be defeated (for the
Legislature). Some of my warmest friends
were against him, as they claimed he could
not be trusted to vote for Stephen M. White
for Senator. I assured them that Barlow
would not go back on his pledges, and they
went to work for aim and saved his election.
He afterward acknowledged to me that I had
secured his election and thanked me for it.
After he was elected I wrote him that as the
administration was Democratic I would have
very little to say about the patronage in my
six counties unless White was elected. But,
with White as Senator, I might have some in
fluence in regard to the Federal appointments
to be made in the Sixth District, and for this
reason I urged him not to go back on White.
In his answer to that letter he wanted me to
give him the appointments in San Luis Obispo
County, which I could not and refused to do.
I wijl place my word against his in this matter
and the acknowledged fact that my campaign
in my county secured his election. This iact
is further strengthened by his defeat for
Sheriff in 1894 by the same influence that
elected him in 1892, although the People's
party in State and county greatly increased in
votes at the last election."
The truth of Mr. Cannon's statement can be
corroboratad by a cloud of witnesses in this
Congressional district. But how did Charles
A. Barlow keep his pledge? Any person who
will take the pains to inform himself will, in
the San Francisco daily newspapers of January
19, 1893, learn that on the evening of the pre
ceding day Mr. Barlow, with a number of
other Populists, did in writing declare that
the means by which Stephen M. White was
elected United States Senator were "false and
treasonable and an outrage, humiliating and
disgraceful, and an infamous wrong to over a
million of voters now struggling to enact
measures which alone can save the Nation
from terrible evil."
In view of such san arrangement, and know
ing these things, Mr. White denounced Barlow
in the severest terms that , ingenuity could in
vent. But soon another sound Is heard. The
Cator henchmen whistle a different tune. The
commanding voice of ] the aspiring socialist
sounds In the ear :of : our ambitious Senator,
and he makes 'unseemly ' haste to dance with
Barlow before a so-called Democratic conven
tion:
'. Clearly there \ is method manifested in the
selfish, unfaithful and desperate ambition of
these socialistic politicians who have surren
dered Democratic principles arid betrayed the
Democracy iito the; hands of men who are
naught; but- the masked apostles of foreign
socialism. It â is a ' game <to gull and humbug

The Committee Warns the People Against the

WHEREAS, It Is the presumption of

performed; , and whereas, It is the legal
duty of the Registrar of Voters of the
City and County of San Francisco to
file the certificate of nominations
made by the regular Republican
convention of this ; year when , ; ten
dered; and whereat, pursuant to
such duty he has filed the certificate
of nomination! of the Republican con
vention held at the Auditorium and
which was called by the County Com
mittee, of which Charles Man waring
Esq. : la ' chairman and -John Jackson
KÂ«Â«j, 'â¢ iii^TÃtiwy.now, therefore, be }t -.â¢
RtSOMJEi), That 7 ',< Republican
State Central Committee hereafter
recognize the above-mentioned Repub
lican convention and the Republican
County Committee as the regular Re
publican organization of the Republi
can party in the City and County of
Â» an Francisco until such time as the
presumption of law aforesaid be over
come by decision of a court of compe
tent jurisdiction.
The foregoing resolution was adopted
by the State Central Committee at a meet
ing held in its ; rooms in the Palace Hotel
yesterday afternoon.
It is a declaration that John D. Spreckols
has won the fight which he has been mak
ing for months against pretended Repub
licans, who have been attempting to dis
rupt and disorganize the party, and there
by defeat its candidates, both local and'
National.
The practically unanimous decision of
the State 'â¢- Central Committee, there being
only one vote against it, that of Mr.
Ruef, has evolved order out of chaos.
â¢ There is but one course ': for
loyal Republicans to pursue. As -the
regular Republican; party of this City
bowed â¢ to the decision of the Na
tional Committee regarding the
Fourth Congressional District Convention
and are supporting thÂ« candidacy of
Thomas B. O'Brien for Congress, so the
people represented by Mr. Ruef ' should
now acquiesce in the decision of the
supreme governing body of the party, and
as loyal Republicans, which I they earn
estly assert themselves to be, they should
support the Republican party ticket.
Republicans will ; understand that this
is purely a local controveisy. It will re
sult in ; bringing Â» out every ' Republican
voter in the City who will vote and work
to carry California for McKinley. 1
v Thomas B. O'Brien set a good example
yesterday. He was around the commit
tee-rooms â  telling J the . country delegates
that , the Auditorium convention was a
legal body, according .to right "arid prece
dent, and that its action should be sus
tained. :. : â  â¢
The decision of the State Central Com
mittee is regarded on all sides as a triumph
for â  decent politics \ as ' the overthrow
of a would-be faction, which thinks more
of spoils than of party and more of office
than of principle.
It is admitted that the committee could
not have acted otherwise than it did. 1 ; The
Registrar, the highest official authority
under the municipal government, had
been obliged to place the nominees of the
Auditorium ; convention on the . official
ballot, after: advising with a score of the
most eminent lawyers in the State. They,
all gave the opinion that the Auditorium
convention was the only Republican con
vention and that its nominees were the
regular Republican nominees.
Now. that the matter has been -decided
not- only by the Registrar, but =by the
State committee of the party, nothing re
mains to : be 'â  done except for all Republi
cans to f get â¢. behind the * ticket and work
loyally or its succe-s. ;

At 2 o'clock in the afternoon the State '

the report of the joint sub-committees
was received.
-. The ; report '; of , the committee was as
follows: ,
' San Francisco,' Cal., September 30, 1800.
â j" ., To the Honorable l/ie Ji< publican State Qmiral
Covimiticcof Californiaâ Gentlemen:, Your tub
committee appointed for the purpose of en
deavoring to suggest a method of com pro WlvÂ»
between the opposing factions in tho Cicy au-J2
county of San Francisco respectfully report to
you as follows :
That we met this day at the hour of 10
o'clock, all of the State Central Committee
members of this sub-committee being present
with the exception of Hon. Allen B. Lemmon.
In accordance with your request of jiestercUy
a number of business men of San Hrancisco
were also present.
James Alva Watt 'was present on behalf of
one of the contesting factions and A. Ruti
represented the other faction. Both gentle
men addressed your committee and the com
mittee of business men.
The following resolution was movfJ, sec
ended and carried:
The contestants having appeared before
your committee, and having beeu unable to
agree upon a basis of compromise, your com
mittee therefore reports that it has failed to
reach any determination with reference tD
any proposition to harmonize. Respectfully
submitted, Ibying B. Dudley,
Chairman of the Sub-Committee.
Resolved, That the State Central Committee
desires to call the attention of the people of
California, and especially of thepeopleof San
Francisco, to a combination on the part of in
fluential powers in the State of California with
the Populists and the Democrats to defeat the
Republican legislative ticket and to elect a
fusion ticket, so-called, for the purpose of
electing a Populist to the Senate of the United
States in 1897 and a Democrat in 1899. That
this combination of influences are and have
been to work is too apparent to this commit
tee to go unneeded, and the people of the State
ol California, and especially of San Francisco,
are called upon in such a way as they may
determine to thwart the designs of those cor
porate influences and combinations. That the
committee deems this matter of vital im
portance for the reason that the po
litical complexion of the United States
Seiiati> may depend upon the result
in California, and a Republican Senate of the
United States is necessary at this period of our
history to secure the enactment of the protec
tive tariff measure upon which this coun
try depends for its future welfare.
This committee calls the attention of all the
voters to the Presidential ticket, and asks
them in the conflict which may be waged be
tween local factions to allow their patriotism
to rise above party concerns in the effort to
secure the election of McKinley and Hobart
for President and Vice-Presidentof the United
States.
That the following resolutions are recom
mended for adoption by the State Central
Committee:
Eesolved, That the disinterested, unbiased
and able services of Major Frank MeLaughlin.
chairman of this committee, in the endeavor
to harmonize the conflicting local differences
in San Francisco are hereby indorsed, and
that this committee commends his untiring
and faithful efforts in that behalf, recognizing
that he has never exceeded the line of disin
terested duty, but that he has in all particu
lars fulfilled and discharged his whole duty
to the committee and the party and to the
satisfaction of the contestants themselves.
Then James W. Rea of San Jose submit
ted the following:
RESOLVED, That it is the sense of the
Republican State Central Committee of
the State of California that the Repub
lican Comity Committee of the City and
County of San Francisco, of which
Charles Hsnwaring Esq. is chairman,
and John Jacksou -Esq. is secretary,
is the regular and only accredited Re
publican County Committee of the City
and County of San Francisco, and that

the Auditorium, and of which the lion
Thomas Riordan was chairman and IV.
H. Rickard was secretary, waÂ» the reg
ular Republican convention of the City
and County of San Francisco.
Mr. Rea, who is a prominent member of
the State Central Committee and of the
executive committee thereof, made an
earnest and powerful speech in support ol
his resolution. He began by some re
marks in favor of party organization, and
declared that it was essential to party per
petuity and party success. He counseled
Mr. Ruei and those for whom he assumed
to sneak, to acquiesce in the decision of
Registrar Hinton and cease from further
attacks upon what had bsen, by that im
partial officer, declared to be the regular
Republican ticket, and what he had put
upon the official ballot as such.
The speaker deprecated any and all
efforts to carry party matters outside of
and beyond the party councils, and he de
clared that any appeal to the courts from
the decision of an impartial committee
made up of impartial Republicans drawn
from every ccunty in the State was un-
Hepublican, and instead of bringing about
harmony was calculated only to prolong
and exaggerate the difficulties which the
committee was organixed and empowered
to settle.
He urged both the contending parties,
no matter what might be the decision of
the committee, to cheerfully acquiesce.
Then he proceeded to inquire into the
legality of the committee which Mr. Watt
represented, and said:
"This committee is the one which has
been recognized in San Francisco by the
Republicans and in the State convention.
It is common knowledge to every Republi
can that this committee, of which Mr.
Manwairing is chairman, is the committee
that has had charge of the.affairs of tUe
Republican party in San Francisco for the
last two years â the committee that has
kept the party organized which called
piimaries and which sent delegates to the
last State convention, which delegates
were recognized and seated in that con
vention as having been legally elected.
"I say everybody knows that this com
mittee, which in the usual and regular
manner called into existence the conven
tion which lately met in the Auditorium
in this city and put before the people a
full Republican ticketâ the ticket that was
filed with Registrar Hinton, a gentleman
who enjoys a renutation for honesty and
impartialityâ everybody knows that this
is the legal committee and the legal con
vention, and that it has been recognized
as the legal Republican ticket of this City.
"I therefore have introduced this resolu
tion, I know that it is right and I am
never afraid to vote or voice my convic
tions.
"Something has been said about John
D. Spreckels. Who is Jotn D. Bpreckels?
I know and you know, and every man in
California knows that there is not a truer
or more loyal Republican or a manlier or
more honest man in this State than he.
[Applause.] He has done much for the
Republican party, and he will do more
lor it, and we should sustain and encour
age him. He stands for Republican or
ganization and seeks only the success of
the Republican party.
"The name of his honored father, Claus
Spreckein, which is on the electoral ticket,
is worth hundreds of votes for us in
Santa Clara County. John D. Spreckels
is an honest man, a true Â»nd unselfish Re
publican, and he should be sustained, and
he is sustained, by the people and the Re
publicans of California.
"Who is opposing him? You know
and I knowâ a man named Martin Kelly.
Yon know and I know what he is. You
know his record. Who is aiding and en
couraging Martin Kelly? You irnow and
I know and everybody knows ttiat it is
that lying, blackmailing sheet, the Exam
iner. That is the paper that is trying to
defeat the purpose of our councils a*d to
diride and defeat the Republican party,
"Do you want to aid this blackmailiue
sheet that is lying about and ridiculing
Republicans in this State ai
it in its attempt to foist Marti
the Republican party in San TTrancisco to
defeat our ticket ? No, gentle- ten i Jot uÂ»,
representing the Republican party of this
State, stand by the regular legal organiza
tion in San Francisco. We need more
men like John D. Spreckels to take an in
terest in public affairs, and if Mr. Ruef
and those whom he represents are loyal
and true Republicans they will submit to
the decision of this committee, whatever
it may be."
E. A. yon Schmidt of Alameda made an
earnest speech counselling harmony. He
urged upon all parties represented to sub
mit to the decision of the State committee.
He also called attention to the lact that
the organization that James Alva Watt
represented had loyally acquiesced in the
decision of the National Committee and
was supporting Thomas B. O'Brien for
Congressman in the Fourth District. He
urged also upon Mr. Ruef that whatever
the decision of the committee might be he
and his friends should submit to it and
stop the contest at once.
That was the duty of all Republicans,
he said. They should not carry their
quarrels beyond the party councils. It
would be eratifying to all Republicans to
know that both parties to the controversy
assured the committee that the contest
was purely a local one, and that each side
should vie with each other in supporting
the National ticket.
Dudley of San Diego presented the sub
stitute which appears at the head of this
article, and the substitute was adopted
with but one dissenting vote, that of Mr.
Reuf. It may be seen that it expresses
the same sentiment as that in Mr. Kea's
resolution, but in different words.
A READY INDORSEMENT,

Rousing Meetiog of the Thirty-Sev
enth District Repub lean
Club-
There was an overflow meeting of the
Republicans of the Thirty-seventh As
sembly-District held at 1940 Market street
last night.
In calling the meeting to order Chair
man McCarthy congratulated the Repub
lican party for the manly and independ
ent stand it had taken during the trying
ordeal through wbicii its leaders and
managers had gone through, and in this
connection, he said, too much praise
could not be given to The Call for the
stand it had taken to keep the party in
tdCt.
No sooner had the name of The Call
been mentioned than a sudden and spon
taneous burst of applause came from every
quarter of the hall." An impetuous etiorus
of voices moved a vote of J thanks to that
paper and its proprietor, C. M. Sbortridse.
This was carried with a whoop that made
the c-ilinpr ring. :
George W. Rohe, a brilliant youne ora
tor, addressed . the club at considerable
lengtn, reviewing the past history of the
Republican party. .
James Kindney followed with a long
address on the issues of the campaign.
The arrival of E. L Wolfe, the nominee
for State Senator, and W. E. Dean, the
nominee for Auditor, sent the club into an
uproar of cheering and waving of hats.
A motion was made and carried indors
ing these two gentlemen for the offices for
which they have been nominated, as also
that of Edward Elgeltinger, the nominee
for. Supervisor of -the: Twelfth Ward.
Messrs. Wolf and Dean both addressed

injured by a falling roof In Southvilie,
died to-day. Riley Williams (colored),
crushed under a roof, died to-night.
The injured have all been removed to
the hospitals or their homes. Three are
fatally injured and will die. The fatali
ties are likely to be much greater when
reports have been received from the sur
rounding country.
The damage to shipping is heavy. The
steamer Governor Safford, which Jeft
Beaufort, S. C, yesterday morning, went
ashore on Daufuskie Island and is lying
one hundred yards, high and dry, inland.
The steamer Star wenr. to her assistance
this morning, but has not yet returned.
Much anxiety is felt for the tug Cynthia,
which left here before the storm for Bruns
wick. The barks Cuba and Roenfius,
which drifted from their moorings and
went ashore, it is believed, may be saved.
The schooners, Island City and D. B.
Metcalf, which went ashore on their way
to sea, are not damaged. The bark Kyle
more broke away from her anchorage at
Quarantine and is lying against a training
wall half a mile away. The loss of small
sailing vessels is heavy. Upward of
twenty are reported ashore in the marshes
and creeks and on the beach at the mouth
of the river. Most of these were coasting
vessels plying between Savannah and
neighboring ports. The full extent of the
damage and loss of life will not be known
for several days.
The center of the storm passed east of
Savannah and struck inland north of here.
The damage on the South Carolina coast
is believed to be heavy, but so far little
loss of life is reported. The rice planta
tions on the Carolina side of the Savannah
River and along the river west of here
suffered heavily.
The rice in the fields '; was little injured,
being covered with water, but . the store
houses and mills are wrecked and the rice
stored is a total loss. The plantations on
the Ogeecbee and Altamahama rivers on
the v; Georgia ! side also were heavily
damaged. : *
The damage in the city will probably
exceed $1,000,000. Hardly i a building I es
caped, and thousands of houses are roof
less. The I work uof -â¢ clearing , away the
wreckage of the street went on to-day, and

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 1, 1896.
in picturesque Laurel Grove Cemetery,
monuments and gravestones are over
turned, and in some instances the vaults
aro broken in. At the suburban villages
and resorts summer residences were blown
away and pleasure steamers and yachts
were driven ashore, in some instances high
and dry on the low bluffs.
The historic Bethesda Orphan Home,
founded by George Whitefield a century
and a half ago, seven miles in the country
from Savannah, was heavily damaged,
but no loss of life occurred.
Three streetcar lines started operations
at noon to-day. The others are still tied
up, and the cars are standing on tracks all
over the city. The loss to the electric
lines is estimated at $100,000. The electric
light, telephone and police and fire alarm
systems are all down. The Western Union
Telegraph Company has forces of men all
along its lines.
The damaee to the railroads will foot
up over $250,000. Tne wreckage of the
Plant system passenger depot and the
Georgia and Alabama Railroad freight
warehouses has been partially cleared
away, and the tracks are passable and
trains are running on time.
Lighthouse-keeper Evans reached the
city on a boat late this afternoon with the
first news from Tybee Island at the mouth
of the Savannah River. The storm there
was severe. All oi the hotels are damaged,
and the pavilions of the Hotel Tybee and
South End Hotel, both large structures,
were carried away.
The Chattanoochae clubhouse, at the
south end of the beach, was unroofed.
The cottages fronting the beach for a dis
tance of four miles are all damaged.
The sea was driven over the low islands
between Tybee and the city, and it is be
lieved the Tybee railroad is washed away
for a distance of several miles. The road
was constructed on the marsh and the loss
will be heavy. There is believed to have
been no loss of life on Tybee.
A special to the Morning News from
Burroughs (Ga.) says: The storm here
yesterday started at 10 o'clock and lasted
until 11:15 o'clock. Trees were blown in
the woods and the roads. About fifteen
houses in different places were blown
down. All the stacks in the rice fields are
blown down. The new Ogeechee Baptist
church at Shiloh and the new Episco
palian church are blown to the ground.
Three lives were lost and several persons
crippled.
The loss is estimated at $6000. Every
person had to leave his house and go out
h>to the open field to save his life. Nearly
evtsry telegraph wire out of Savannah is
still prostrated. Storm news was sent
this morning to the News from many
points in Georgia and Florida by mail.
The storm appears to have struck land
it Tampa and swept northward to Savan
nah, thence jumping on the north. The
velocity of the wind was unusually high
even for a tornado, but its duration at
each place was short â about an hour. Had
the storm been long continued everything
in its path would have been leveled and
the loss of life must of necessity have been
heavy.
Brunswick was wrecked by the hurri
cane. The property loss is estimated at
between $350,000 and $500,000. The loss of
lift* is four so far as known. The victims
are all colored.
HAVOC AT WASHINGTON.
Tree* Vprocted and Hoof a Torn from
Hundred! of Building*.
WASHINGTON, ,D. C, Sept. 30.â The
West Indian tornado which struck Wash
ington between 11 p. m. and midnight last
night respected neither official nor diplo
matic properties. It ripped oft some of
the coping of the White House and laid
low most of the historic trees injthe White
House grounds, including the . elm '- tree
which Lincoln planted, and this gave the
relic fanatics a .fruitful field; for their
operations. llt carried away part of the
roof of the State Department where the
official documents are stored, but fortu
nately left them uninjured. The costly
roof of the Patent Office, constructed after
the fire there some years ago, was rolled
up and distributed all around the neigh
borhood, and skylights half an inch thick
were remorselessly, beaten in. - The Naval
Observatory and, in fact, pretty well every
other public building was more or less
damaged. Diplomatic residences were
not spared. That of the French Minister
was left roofless and even the substantially
built embassy of Great ~ Britain Buffered
the loss of the portico. â¢
Churches and theaters suffered alike.
The slate roof of the Church of the Cove
nant, where President Harrison used to
worship, was blown down, and each square
slate by a curious freak planted itself up
right in the parking which surrounds the
edifice. Still more disastrous was the fate
of the New York Presbyterian Church
which Mr. Bryan recently attended. The
whole tower of that edifice was reduced to
matchwood, and persons in search of
souvenirs had no difficulty in obtaining
them.
Nearly every other church in the city
suffered more or less and the theaters
were equally visited. The tower of the
Grand Opera-house, formerly Albaugh's,
was blown down, fortunately without
hurting anybody. The debris still ob
structs the whole width of one of the
broadest streets in Washington. Several
other theaters lost their roofs in whole or
part. The new Albaugh's Opera-bouse,
built on tne site of Blame's old residence,
where tho Seward assassination was at
tempted, escaped injury, but the watch
man's box at the corner, where through
several wintry weeks newspaper men
awaited the progress of the last illness of
the great Secretary, was caught up by the
storm and crushed into splinters.
The devastation wrought among the
beautiful trees of the capitol was heart
rending. For years the Parking Commis
sion, which controls this part of the Na
tional Capitol decoration, had been im
plored to have the redundant foliage of
these trees trimmed. The reply has always
been that there has not been a sufficient
appropriation made. Now thousands of
trees, which would have weathered this
storm, if reduced to less redundancy,
were blown up by the roots or hopelessly
dismembered, and the damage done can
not be replaced by any appropriation five
times as large as that usually made by
Congress for any one year's tree-cutting.
There was no loss of life as far as was
learned in Washington, though a list of
twenty-four persons seriously injured by
falling branches and crumbling walls is
given out by the hospitals.
The total destruction of property in
Washington City by the storm is estima
ted at nearly half a million dollars.
In Alexandria, the Virginia suburb of
Washington, just across the Potomac
River, the damage done by the storm is
estimated at not less than $100,000, and at
least two lives are known to have been
lost. The killed are Mrs. Louisa Holt and-
William D. Btewart, crushed to death by
falling walls.
Nearly 200 houses were badly damaged
by the tornado in its course.
LAKE MICHIGAN'S FURY.
Great Damage to Shippingâfour Men
JCeported Drowned.
CHICAGO, 111., Sept. 30. -One of the
most severe windstorms known for years
ranged ove r the lake last night and part of
to-day. It seems to have expended most
of its fury over the upper half of Lake
Michigan. The loss of life so far reported
is small, four men having been drowned
by the sinking of the steambarge Sumatra
at Milwaukee. Much minor damage was
done to shipping in Milwaukee, Grand
Haven, Chicago and other ports, and the
masters of such steamers as were out in
the lake during the night report one of
the roughest passages they have ever ex
perienced.
Owing to the lateness of the season and
threatening conditions which prevailed
for twenty-four honrs before the storm
broke most of the sailing fleet was tied up
in different ports, Chicago harbor being
especially crowded. This fact doubtless
explains the small list of casualties.
Along the lake shore in front of this city
all night and this forenoon the waves
dashed over the seawall many feet. In
the hnrbor yachts and schooners were
tossed about like corks, the waves dashing
over the breakwater many feet high. One
lumber schooner dragged her anchors dur
ing the forenoon, and before tugs man
aged to get her under control had crashed
into and sank a number of small craft.
Those on board the different vessels were
rescued, however.
The steamer Atlanta of the Goodrich
line when making her dock this morning
after a very rough passage from Milwaukee
was thrown violently against the piling.
The port side of the steamer's plankinz
was crushed in for a length of twenty-five
feet. The steamship City of Milwaukee
from St. Joseph, with a few passengers
and a large cargo of fruit, arrived minus
her upper mainmast, which was broken
off during the night, and also having a
portion of her bulwarks stove in.
Captain Stewart says the rain fell in tor
rents all night and the wind, which blew
a furious gale, seemed to whip around
from all directions without the slightest
notice. When this side of the lake was
reached the steamship had to haul around
three times before the entrance of the
harbor could be made.
The big tug S. M. Fischer of the Lake
Michigan line left Bouth Chicago yester
day morning with three barees in tow.
When the storm struck them last night it
was determined to run back to port, and
the tug succeeded in getting inside the
Chicago breakwater early this morning
with two of the barges. The other broke
her lines about two miles out and could
not be picked up. Her anchors had been
let go, however, before she broke away
completely and she was sighted this after
noon apparently riding safely. It is
feared, howerer, that if the wind freshens
again to-night she will roll so that the
cargo will be pitched into the lake.
Dispatches from many other lake points
tell substantially the same story. On Lake
Superior the storm does not appear to have
been so severe, although at Duluth a
36-mile gale was reported.

DEMOLATION AT HARRISBURG.
The City Filled With Roofless Houses
and Uprooted Trera.
HJRRISBURG, Pa., Sept. 30.â The
awful fury of the storm king was not
fuL'.' realized in this city until daylight,
when the great force of the hurricane,
which swept over this section at 1 o'clock
this morning, was evidenced in the roof
less houses, uprooted trees and damaged
property generally. Hundreds of houses
were unroofed, but not a single human
being was injured amid the frightful crash
ing of bouses and falling chimneys. The
opera-house was partially unroofed, and
many windows were broken in churches
and school-hO'Jsesjv^Jrain^on the Pennsyl
vania Railroad werfc run "via Lock Haven
for several hours, owing to a landslide
at Mapleton, but regular traffic was estab
lished this afternoon.
In the surrounding districts much dam
age is reported and many crops are ruined.
Churches were wrecked in several country
places, and at Stoltcn an overhead bridge
fell across the Pennsylvania railroad. An
express train dashed into the debris a mo
ment later. The locomotive and several
cars were damaged, but nobody was hurt
It had been a rtiny, windy day, but it
was not until midnight that the wind as
sumed the violencÂ« of a gale. It lashed
itself into sections of whirlwinds thirty
minutes later, and jy 1 o'clock and for
over an hour after it showed the teeth of a
small cyclone. Thee were scores of peo
ple in the city wio spent the night
after 12 o'clock in their cellars praying
that the fate of St. buis might not be in
store for Harrisburj
Conservative estiiates of the loss from
the storm in the cit vary from $150,000 to
$200,000. _
AT LESINON, PA.
Property Losses bhthe Storm Enormous,
but AÂ» atalitirs.
LEBANON, Pa., ept. 30.â Later reports
show that the dam;;e by the storm last
night was far greier than at first sup
posed. In additiono the roundhouse of
the Lebanon and Crnwall railroad com
pany being demolised, that of the Corn
wall railroad met a milar fate. The losses
sustained by these to companies will run
into the thousands. The United Brethren
Church at Annvillevas wrecked and the
Sunnyside mills we> unroofed. A part of
the roof of the Unitd Brethren Church in
Lebanon was carrieaway, as well as tnose
dwellings of JosephStrohman and F. It.
Freliff.
At the Iron City 1-ewery the boiler and
engine houses weresveled to the ground,
the top of the steele of the Salem Luth

brick furnace at Loanon is in ruins. It
is difficult to estinte the extent of the
damage.
Wilson Chrisman nd his family had a
most thrilling escar. They had left the
house when one of te walls collapsed, fill
ing their sleeping ajirtments with a mass
of brick and mortar.
A portion of the s eple of the Reformed
Church at Jameston was blown away,
and the steeple of it Sedborg church was
twisted out of shape No one was seriously
injured, as far as ca.be learned.

DEADLY FLOOD IS VIRGINIA.
The Dam of Lake A take Bursts With
Appalling Besults.
RICHMOND, Va., Sept. 30.â The heavy
rain at Stanton on Tuesday ended that
evening in the bursting of the dam at
Lake Atake, the waters of which rushed
into the creek which runs through the
city, flooded the lower section, destroying
a vast deal of property and causing a loss
of several lives. The Wilkes building was
undermined and fell.
Burk's livery stable was turned upside
down, the bridges over the creek were
swept away and the crown building is a
wreck. Thornsburg stables are a ruin and
there is a general wreck everywhere.
About forty horses and mules were
drowned and the bodies of five negroes
have been recovered. Other persons are
nmsing. The creek at Waynesboro rose
fifteen feet and wrenched buildings from
their foundations. One man was drowned.
Reports from all the surrounding country
report great losses to the farmers. The
loss at Staunton is estimated at $150,000.
DISASTROUS TO YACHTS.
Small Craft in A'ew York Harbors

NEW ROCHELLE, N. V., Sept. 30.-The
heavy wind of last night made havoc
among the yachts anchored in this har
bor, four of which are on the rocks off
Premium Point, the summer home of C.
Oliver Iselin. The schooner Alice X of
Mount Vernon is badly wrecked. The cat
boat Tom Boy is on the rocks, an almost
hopeless wreck. The steam yacht Ban
shee is also wrecked.
The Defender, which is located in the
lower harbor, was carefully watched by
Captain Odell, her skipper, and sustained
no injury.
At Larchmont the steam yacht Olga
was driven on Dogshead Rock. Many
other yachts were damaged, but none seri

STRIKING TELEGRAPHERS
Canadian Pacific Officials Say
It Is Ooly a Temporary
Inconvenience.
But the Road Is Tied Up and the
Operators Are Confident of
Victory.
MONTREAL, Oj.t., Sept. 30.â There are
no startling develop i^-"-.: - in cormeetfen
with the strike. Nearly all incoming pas
senger trains have been more or less de
layed to-day, but the railway officials
claim they are replacing tne strikers and
expect to have everything running
smoothly by to-morrow.
The company's claim, however, is em
phatically contradicted by Chief Pierson
and other members of the strike commit
tee. Pierson to-night said the situation
remains practically unchanged. He had
received advices from many points, which
showed that the men were standing to
their colors.
As to the prospect of the trainmen and
engineers joining the strike, Pierson said
he could not state anything definite at
present, but the matter was being dis
cussed by various meetings of railroad
men.
The railway officials state that many
operators are applying for work and that
inconvenience was about all there was to
the situation.
At Quebec there is virtually no change
in the situation. Passenger trains are ar
riving and leaving on time, but no freights
are moving. Local Superintendent Hall
is of the opinion that the strike will be
settled in a week.
At Ottawa the situation in regard to the
strike is unchanged. No movement has
been taken by the engineers and trainmen
to indicate that they will join them. One
or two freight trains are moving, but at
Pembroke and other points west two or
three freight trains are sidetracked.
CHAMBERLAIN'S PERIL
The British Colonial Secretary Constantly
Guarded by Detectives During His
American Visit.
SALEM, Mass., Sept. 30.â The publica
tion of the fact that Right Hon. Joseph
Chamberlain, who has been visiting his
wife's parents at Danvers during the past
month, has been constantly guarded by
detectives during his stay here, caused
considerable excitement, as it was well
known thai his visit was a purely social
one and had no political significance.
Now that the story has leaked out there
is apparently no wish to corral the real
facts, and Mrs. Endicott, mother of Mrs.
Chamberlain, talked with a newspaper re
porter this afternoon regarding the matter.
She said that soon after Mr. Chamberlain's
arrival in this country the Secret Service
Department at Washington was put in
possession of certain information which
ed them to send two of their agents to
be Endicott estate, and they remained
there, accompanying Mr. Chamberlain
wherever he went, and they left witn him
for New York. What the deparment's
information is is not known.

CUMBERLAND, Md., Sept. 30.â Few
audiences of the same size addressed by
Mr. Bryan have been so wildly demonstra
tive as that at Martinsbure to-day. The
candidate arrived just m Jeff Chandler of
California was concluding a free-coinage
speech. He was introduced by Senator
Faulkner, and in the course of his re
marks said:
In a platform many questions are covered
but the election always turns upon some para
mount issue, and in this campaign we have de
clared that the money; question is the para
mount I issue. If there are other things in
which you believe, the settlement of the other
things can be postponed until alter we have
met and paused the crisis presented by the ad
vocates of the gold standard. Our opponents,
not we, are responsible for the fact that in this
campaign we are engaged in a battle royal be
tween the money power and the common peo
ple. :-â â ;. ; ;>ââ¢;, â¢- : -... - â --â :.-â â â .â . â 
All the great questions which have from
time â¢â  to ;; time ; been ; forced ' con ; the s pub
lic have been forced, not by the â  many, but
by the few, ana the great struggles wnich have
occupied the thoughts of the world have been
struggles of the masses in self-defense, and so
in this campaign the ; hosts are '.being mar
shaled to resist the aggressions of the gold
standard.
If I were to tell you that a foreign army was
coming to attack you or that a foreign warship
was anchored nt our gates I could expect every
one of you to join in an effort to preserve our
country from invasion. A foreign financial
policy has not only invaded our country, but
it has gained a foothold here, and a great Na
tional partyâ the Republican partyâ has de
clared that that foreign policy shal' remain
here until foreigners consent to its emoval.
[Applause.] The gold standard idea is an im
ported idea [applause] and, my rieuds, I care
not whether you attempt to restrain it by a
high tariff or a low tariff I shall not be con
tent until it shall be driven back and find no
more a home in our midst. [Applause.]
â  This contest upon which we are entered â  is
not a temporary fight. . Some of our, Demo
cratic friends who have worked with us in the
past tell us that in this campaign they will
either work with the Republicans or stop
half-way before our ranks and the Republican
ranks until they summon enough courage to
go to the other . half and declare themselves
Republicans. '. [Applause.] I want them to go
understanding that they go never to return
until they come back in sackcloth and ashes.
[Applause.] If these men who have gained
their prominence through the honors given
by ' the Democratic party have an > idea that
they can withdraw in the Â« face of the enemy
and then be invited back to take command
hereafter they are making a mistake, the

on, â¢â â  [Applause.] ihis â¢is. no . temporary ais
agreement. â¢ Those wno leave the Democratic
party to-day leave Democracy, and I can never
excuse themselves hereafter. [Applause.]
On the run of the Bryan special up the
beautiful Potomac River from Martins
burg to Cumberland, Mr. Bryan made a
few remarks to a small crowd at Hancock,
Met., saying:
Ingoing west over the country I have pre
sented our cause. Whether it results in my
election or defeat is a matter of very little con
sequence to me, but 1 do believe the American
people ought to be concerned as to the poli
cies of this Government and that they ought
to make that interest manifest at the ballot
box. [Cheers and applause.]
Mr. Bryan's train reached Cumberland
at 3 p. m.

LONG RIDE AND DISMAL
WEATHER.
But a Happy Address by Major
McKinley Is More Than
Recompense.
FACTS OF INTEREST TO THE
FARMER.
His Prosperity, Like That of the
Laborer, Depends Upon Repub
lican Success.
CANTON, Ohio, Sept. 30 ---After an all
night ride on the cars a d jlegati'on of 400
enthusiastic voters frorr. Center County,
Pa., arrived here at 8 o'clock this morning
and marched through a blinding rain to
the tabernacle. Major McKinley took an
early and hurried breakfast and was
driven down to meet his visitors a few
minutes after their arrival. His appear
ance on the stage was the signal for an
outburst of cheering. The delegations
forgot all about the long ride and the dis
mal weather. They threw their hats in
the air and shouted and cheered and ap
plauded Major McKinley for five minutes.
The spokesman made an appropriate ad
dress, to which Major McKinley replied:
It gives me very great pleasure to meet at
my home my fellow-citizens of Center County,
Pa. Center County has been one of the points
in Pennsylvania from which Stark County,
which is this county, has recruited a consider
able portion of its population. It was unnec
essary, therefore, for Mr. Cassidy to assure me
that I was to speak to an extraordinary body
of men. For, knowing as I do the excellent
charicter of Center County people who live in
Stark County [applause], I am glad to address
the citizens of that county that has furnished
so many distinguished men to the public ser
vice. It was my honor to be personally ac
quainted with the old War Governor, Andrew
G. Curtin [applause], with whom 1 served for a
time in the National House of Representatives.
It has . been my privilege to know for years
Governor Beaver, as well at uovemor Hast
ings. [Great Applause.] Both of them have
spoken from this platform many, many times,
and no speakers ever came to this city who
hove been more welcome or who have been
favored with larger audiences than these two
distinguished citizens of your county. I am
glad to meet the Republicans- of the great Re
publican State of the American Union. [Ap
plause.] ,

ypu a feeling â of kinship. 1 know your gnat
resources. I'â  know .our wonderful manufac
turing achievements. I know the wealth of
your State and its splendid citizenship, and I
am always glad to be assured by Pennsylvania
that in this great struggle your great State will
lead in, the triumphant march ot Republican
principles. [Applause.] ' - ..'.'.
I . have often wondered if Pennsylvania's
powerful influence for stability, conservatism
and prosperity in the Union ; and its great
strength and self-supporting capacity as a
commonwealth in that Union was properly ap
preciated. Her agriculture, commerce and
- manufactures, while independent in one sense,
have always been mutually interdependent,
beneficial and helpful. The whole com
munity has profited by each and all of them.
This has been the case ever since its settle
ment in pioneer days, and under its wise sys
tem of political economy, not fostered by the
creed of visionaries, but that of plain, sensible,
practical men, it is more apparent to-day than
ever.
By the census of 1880 1 have noted, as doubt
lessly you have noticed, that you have farm
values in Pennsylvania In your 20,000,000
acres oi $975,000,000, or an average valuation
of more than $48 per acre to the whole State;
in your products more than $129,000,000, or
an average yield in prosperous times, when
prices were food; of $6 per acre, while your
manufacturers, %ho benefit and enrich the
farmers, have an annual payroll or reward of
labor of $134,000,000, which would mean that
your farmers would have, if they furnished all
the breadstuffs and other farm products that
laborers consume, nenrly $6 50 per acre each
and every one of which are prosperous when
business is good and all are embarrsssed when
business is bad. No other similar reward to
husbandry iB presented an/where, and I make
no apology, my fellow-citizens, for urging a
like policy everywhere, or for havincr always
endeavored to the extent of lay best efforts to
continue this wise system under which you
have had such splendid results in the State of
Pennsylvania. [Applause.] --\
Why, should we not do all our work and
spend all our own wages at home, giving both
farmers and workingmen the richest rewards
for their labor of any country under gun?
[Applause and cries "That's the 6tuff."] An
swer that my fellow-citizens.. [Applause and
cries of "Give us protection."] My greatest
concern, my chief object in this, as In every
campaign, is to drive from our shores distress
and want and misery and lift up those who
are bowed down and bring to those who are
in want work and prosperity. [Applause.] And
I will never view with tolerance any system
. which has a different object toward any Ameri
can citizen anywhere within the limits of our
great Republic. [Ap&lause and cries of "Hur
rah for McKinley. "J
The other question involved in this cam
paign is the reactionary policy of free silver,
which I need hardly mention to a Pennsyi
vanla audience, 10 the people of purest Quaker
descent, who love honesty and practice it.
[Applause.] Otieof the injurious effects from
the mere advocacy of free gilver, and which is
too-little noted, is that it makes it harder to
induce many who woud otherwise invest to
enter legitimate public and private enter
prises. There is a waiting. There is distress
on every hand* Men <Jo not know what the
future has in store /or them. This is oarticu
larly observable in citiea which are endeavor
ing to sell their boud> to make public improve
ments. Many cities anticipate the collection
4Â» of taxes lor the purpose ol making public Im
provements. The very threat of free silver is
stopping the sale of city bonds in every part
of the country. This loss falls with peculiar
force upon laborers everywhere. Cities can
ordinarily make improvements if they car.
borrow the money; if they cannot borrow
money they cannot make improvements. If
they cannot make improvements hundreds
and thousands ot laboring men who depend
upon this class of work for their daily bread
arc deprived of employment.
During the hard times of the past three
years many of our cities have taken care of
the unemployed by making such improve
ments, but these are now brought to a sudden
stop, and it is entailing a further los ; ' '
en and adding distress to iheir iiomi
again, men engaged in the productive enter
prises find it difficult, if not quite impossible,
to secure enough money to conduct their bust
ness. Men will not part with their money un
less they ha'se reasonable assurance of its safe
return. The trouble is that distrust is every
where present. Confidence has been dis
placed by fear and apprehension. The whole
business world is awaiting the settlement of
the question of public and private honesty.
When that is rightly settled on the side of
ccr.iscience and Rood moral-; confidence will
come again, and with it money will circulate
and business activity will appear. [Applause.]

Ex-State Setwtor Larnpson of Ohio, who
has just returned from a speech-making
trip to lowa, report; a remarkable growth
of Republican sentiment in that Slate,
and it will probably co for McKinley by a
majority of 10,000. It is calculated that
the great sound-money parade arranged
lor October 9 will require upward of twelve
hours to pass a given point, and tbe com
mittee in charge is in something of a
quandary as to how to handle this immense
crowd. It is possible that the parade will
be divided into two sections in order to
successfully maneuver it. One hundred
thousand men, it is estimated, will be in
line.
Senator Warren of Wyoming reports to
headquarters:
"If our progress continues as fast as it
has in the past sixty days we shall carry
the State by a good sate majority. If I
were a betting man I should certainly bet
on our winning in this State."

WEST POINT, Nebe., Sept. 30.â The
company of Union veterans touring in this
State addressed the people of Northern
Nebraska at West Point to-day. A crowd

Generals Sickels, Alger, Stewart, Howard,
Corporal Tanner and ex-Senator Mander
son and General Cowan of Omaha. Pub
lic schools were closed and business al
most entirely suspended. The exercises
were held in the park, and while the

great. General Sickles received a genuine
ovation. He said he was a Democrat of
fifty years' standing, with the span of life
nearly spent. There wa< nothing the Re

accent, but in the present emergency he
was impelled to put aside party feeling
and vote for what he considered the integ

At Freemont the visit of the Union
generals this evening was made the oc
casion of the greatest demonstration of
the campaign. Visitors came from all

ANARCHY IN BOHEMIA.
Striking Coal Miners Worked Vp to a
Han</erous Pitch.
VIENNA, Austria, Bept. 30.âTwenty
five hundred coal miners at iJrux and
Occeg in Bohemia have gone on strike,
and in the ensuing riots to-day wrecked
the offices of the mining companies and
the buildings surrounding the entrances
to the mines. A number of the mine
officers were assaulted and severely in
jured. The strikers made no demand for
an increase in their wages, neither did
they n.aite any statement of grievances,
and the rioting is believed to have been
the result of anarchist doctrines among
the men. Troops have beeq sent tc the
scene.

NEW YORK, N. V., Sept. 30.â The
Herald's special from Havana says: Ad
vices have been received from Managua,
Nicaragua, that a plot was formed in
Managua to overthrow the Government of
that country and kill President Zelaya.
Some of the most prominent persons
were implicated in tbe plan.
Since the close of the last rebellion Ze
laya' s* enemies and a majority of his former
allies, namely, the Conservatives, have
been plotting to upset the Government Dy
force of arms.
The barracks and palaces were to be as
saulted simultaneously and President
Zelaya was to be assassinated. The bar
racks were to be blown up by dynamite in

Seniors Defeat the Freshmen in
an Exciting Game of
Football.
Newcomers Lose Hope When the
Veterans Score Their First
Touchdown.
STANFORD UNIVERBITY. Cal., Sept.
30.â The first of the interclass football
games was played to-day between the
seniors and freshmen, to decide the cham
pionship. Larger crowds than usual were
on hand to witness the game, and while
the upper-class team played much more
like a team than in its previous game, the
freshmen were badly handicapped and
confused by the loss of several men who
are "convalescing."
The line oi the seniors was much
stronger than that ol the freshmen and
they made fewer bad breaks. The work
of tne freshmen grew poorer after the
first touchdown, which was made four
minutes after play began. They seemed
to lose heart and 'confidence, and the
heavy senior line piled through them at
will. Several players were "winded"
during the play and time taken out for
them to recover prolonged the game. The
teams lined up at 4:30 as follows:

Children Cry for Pitcher's Castorfa,
BRINGS HIS BABES
FROM FAR YUKON
Remarkable Trip of a Miner
Through the Wilds
of Alaska.
BEARS A PRECIOUS FACE.
Travels Over a Snow* Covered
Pass With His Twin Boys
on His Shoulders.
THEY ARE BUT TWO YEARS OLD.
How the First White Children Born
at Six-Mile Crossed the
Mountains.
SEATTLE. Wash.. Sept. 30.â Born
within the borders of a land owned by the
United States and yet farther away from
the center of their own country civiliza
tion than any other child or children, is
the distinction which will follow Joseph
and Bernard Day through life. They are
two-year-old twins, and arrived in this
city to-day on the steamer Willapa direct
from Alaska, and the place of their birth
is not the only thing remarkable thus far
in their lives, for with the aid of their
father they made, in order to reach Ju
neau and make connections with the Wil
lapa, a trip of many days, coming from
the Yukon mining district and crossing
the grand but dangerous summit by the
Chilcat Pass. Others many years their
senoirs have attempted to make that
same trip and were never heard of again,
but the babes are alive and well, and
while they can't talk yet they hope to
some day be able to discuss tbe trip as it
comes to them from the lips of their
father, TJ. Day.
The story of their birth, of their re
markable trip and other facts connected
with them is one that does not find its
way into print very often. U. Day is a
miner. He is a big, fine-looking man and
for years before he decided to go to Alas
ka he worked in the silver mines of the
East. He wai experienced in his busi
ness and when he made a trip to Alaska
four years ago and took a look at the coun
try he made up his mind that he would
come back to the United States and get
his wife, a bride of a few months, and re
turn to the land of gold. He came back
and his wife, who was at that time living
with some well-to-do relatives in a suburb
of Minneapolis, Minn., consented to re
turn with him to Alaska. She was not
very strong, but had plenty of nerve, and
in the spring, with the aid of her hus
band, she reached the Yukon mining dis
trict in safety.
Her coming was a great event among
the miners. But one or two women had
ever been among them and those had held
aloof from the common miners. Mrs. Day
took an interest in them and endeavored
to bring happiness into their lives.
Just two years ago she gave birth to
twin boys. They were big and healthy,
had eyes that were black as coal and
cheeks as red as apples. The exact date of
tbeir birth was October 13, 1894, and the
place Sixty-Mile Creek. Never did the
coming of any one, not even of the hardy
men who carry the mail, create such a
fervor in the Yukon district. Miners who
came down to-day say that for three
months after the birth of the twins Mr.
and Mrs. Day received presents from min
ers far away who beard of the new arriv
als. They were the first children ever
Dorn in the Yukon district, and they were
petted and caressed and humored as
though they were the children of gome
great king.
On June 3, this year, Mrs. Day, who had
not been well since the birth of the chil
dren, died, and there was general mourn
ing in camp.
Everybody wondered what would become
of the twins. Day told his friends that in
the fall he would take them to the United
States and place them with their mother's
relatives at Minneapolis. The miners
laughed at him and said that it would be
impossible for him to make the trip until
the babies were old enough to walk.
Two months ago Day decided to leave
tbe Yukon with his little ones. The
miners generally were of the opinion that
it would mean death for the children and
probably for the father if he undertook
the trip. Day was determined. He said
that to keep the children at Sixty Mile
would mean a life of ignorance and suffer
ing. So early in July Day started for
Juneau with the prides of tne Yukon.
Before his departure old and hardened
miners shed tears and and prayed for the
safety of the children. Day said that if
they died he would die with them.
They were dressed in clothes of heavy
woolen cloth and, strange as it may seem,
made tbe trip the greater part of the way
strapped on tne shoulders of their father.
He carried them similar to the way In
dian women pack their papooses about.
They were a great burden, when the
length of the trip is taken into considera
tion and the further fact that Day had a
pack of provisions and blankets to carry
with him. Day says that at times the
weather was very cold and when his
babies would not even cry he would think
that probably they were benumbed by the
cold. Then he would take a peep at them
and they would either be laughing or
sleeping. Once he says tbey amused
themselves all day long playing with his
lone hair.
When night came on and he wai ready
to rest, Day would remove the children
from his back and they would Bleep in his
arms.
"Not once did they ever so much as
cry." says Day.
Tbe trip across the summit of the Chil
cat Pass was the most severe of all, but
the little ones stood it all right, though
Day says they must have suffered some,
because he did himself. Several times, in
crossing the summit, Day, weak with the
long trip and the heavy burden, slipped,
and but for the precious ones on his back,
he says, be believes he would have given
up, sunk down and perished. Their coo
ing, he says, aroused him, and he would
struggle on.
Juneau was finally reached and safely;
there the babes were weighed and it was
found that they had grown fat during
their remarkable journey. They re
mained there a little while, and when the
Wiilapa arrived took passage on it for the
Sound.
In a day or two Day will leave with his
sons tor Minneapolis, where they will be
placed with relatives and educated, old
miners say the trip will go down as the
most remarkable ever made from the
Yukon district to Juneau.

SOCIAL SENSATION
OF PALO ALTO
Stanford's Leading Frater
nity Renounces Its
Vows.
ARE "FIJIS" NO MORE.
They Become a Local Society
in Spite of Strenuous
Oppcsition.
BUT THEIR ALUMNI APPROVE
i
Whole College World Affected and
Very Severe Censures Sure
, to Follow.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Sept.
30. â A sensation unequaled in the history
of the university, and without parallel in
club-life of oilier colleges, has just devel
oped here. The "Fiji*. ' a branch of the
National college Greek-letter fraternity of
Phi Gamma Delta, announced to-night
that they have surrendered their charter,
renounced nllegiance to the National order
and have become a local society without
other affiliations.
This action conies unexpectedly. It is
certain to be far-reaching in its effects
throughout the college world. The men
participating in it will, as a natural re
sult, be expelled from the order, that being
tne only waj', it is said, in whicn members
of college secret societies can be olficially
divorced from their oath-bound obliga
tions to the fraternity and permitted to
join another order.
Phi Gamma Delta is one of the oldest
Greek-letter fraternities, having been
founded in 1543. It has chapters In forty
eight of the larger colleges and universi
ties in the United States, graduate chap
ters in several of the larger cities and an
active membership of tJOO collegians, with
hundreds of graduate members in the pro
fessional world, many of them of consider
able prominence. Among such are col
lege presidents and a large number of col
lege professors, jurists and statesmen,
clergymen and litterateurs. Of the last
mentioned Ridpath, the noted historian;
Eggleson of "The Hoosier Schoolmaster"
and Gtaeral Lew Wallace of "Ben Hur"
are familar names, while the Right Rev.
McLaren, the venerable Episcopal Bishop
of Chicago and one of the earliest initiates
of the fraternity, stands at the head of
a numerous representation among the
clergy.
The Stanford chapter, organized only a
few weeks after the university opened its
doors, was one of the first in tne field.
Early establishing itself in the clubhouse
it assumed and maintained the lead in
the social and fraternity Jife of the uni
versity. As an example of its relative
standing it is only necessary to cite last
year's record. With a chapter member
ship of about fifteen men among 1100
students and in competition with some
ten or more other fraternity chapters it
received many of the most coveted
positions attainable through individual
ritness â captain and two other
men of the Varsity football eleven,
captain and another player of t Lie, Varsity
baseball team, the intercollegiate cham
pion hurdler, president and three other
members of tbe glee club, president of one
of the four classes, captains of two class
football teams and representatives upon
tbe college publications and in various
student organizations. And this cbaper,
well known by reputation to the college
fraternity world because of its unique
vusition in a new university to which a
great deal of attention has been attracted,
is now a thing of the past so Jar as its
name and its National associations are
concerned. It has severed the fraternal
Jinks binding it to a great family of college
chapters and it has come out alone as an
independent local order under the name
Sigma Eho Eta.
Tnere are many results to follow from
this acr. Every one of the torty-seven re
maining chapters must suffer more or less
in its particular college because of the loss
to the fraternity of one of its star chapters.
In some colleges it may disturb the rela
tive positions of the different fraternities.
It is sure to give rise to a great deal of
comment and unfavorable comment, too,
for the National fraternity most affected
will condemn the move, and others, to
guard against its repetition elsewhere, will
denounce it roundly in their fraternity
magazines.
In Spokane, Wash., there is a graduate
chapter of this fraternity with a Superior
Judge, capitalists and professional men
among the members whose college days
were spent in the East. In this State there
are said to be about a hundred old mem
bers, many of them in San Francisco,
where there is another graduate chapter
with Chief of the Weather Bureau Ham
moo at its head, and lawyers, doctors,
ministers and others among its older rep
resentatives from Eastern colleges. There
are also graduates of tno University of
California, for at Berkeley there has Jong
been a chapter of Phi Gamma Delta, and
it is reputed to stand among the ilr-st.
In spite of all these disagreeable com
plications the Stanford "Fijis," as they
are best known, have taken this step,
counseled, they say, after a thorough
understanding of the case, by their own
alumni and not opposed by members of
the fraternity in the Stanford faculty.
There are three such members, Professors
Ross, Newcomer and Kriehn.
It is surmised that tbe men here con
template alliance ultimately with one of
the best-known and most conservative
Eastern fraternities.

WRECKED ON TUGIDEK ISLAND.
The Bark James A. Borland Strikes a Rock
and Is Pounded to Pieces
by the Sea.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., Sept. 30.â
Another wreck has been added to the long
list of disasters that have occurred this
winter in the North Pacific Ocean. The
bark James A. Borland, owned by the
Alaska Packers' Association of San Fran
cisco, laden with 29,000 cases of salmon
belonging to the same company, tvent
ashore on Tugidek Island, Alaska, and
just as it was nearins its destination was
overtaken by a dense fog. To intensify
the danger a fresh breeze sprung up from
the southwest and drove the bark in
among a number of small islands. With
out warning and in a fog so thick that
objects a ship's length away could not be
discerned, the vessel struck a needle
shaped rock, Captain Miller says, and
the next instant it wa9 pounding itself to
pieces. The accident occurred Jate at
night, but the om'cers and crew managed
to remain aboard until daylight, when
they succeeded in reaching shore, barely
saving only their personal effects and the
ship's instruments.
In forty-eight hours the bark broke to
pieces and thousands of cases of salmon
floated ashore. At a fishing cannery near
by the crew found shalter until it secured
transportation to Kodiak Island, where it
embarked on the steamer A fognak for this
port.

how the history of the United States
should be taught. She told her pupils in
Troutdale that a popular United States
history was a iie, a delusion and a snare.
The directors of district 48 declared that
Miss House was teaching treason and that
she must stop it. Indignation meetings
were held and the wrathful people vowed
they would go in a body and depose Miss
Emily from ncr position as teacher if the
directors did not act. Heads of families
disputed and fought over it and a Trout
dale orator added fuel to ths flames by
making a speech.
Two of the directors were with Miss
House. H. .). Prosser, clerk of the dis
trict, was very much opposed to her. He
locked the door of the schoolhouse. Miss
House got in by breaking down the door
and opened school. Then she was arrest
ed for trespass. Miss House retaliated by
suing Andrew Heun, a School Director, for
defamation and slander. She asked for
$20,000 damages to her character and the
jury in the Circuit Court to-day awarded
her $200.
FOLSOM CONVICTS' PLOT
Officials Find a Key, Files and
a Slungshot in Bandit
Brady's Cell.
Had Piaaned With Prisoner Callen
dine to Release a Number
of Inmates.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Sept. 30.â The
finding of a newly made key in tbe cell of
the Folsom State prison occupied by
Bandit Brady, the noted train-robber, and
L. L. Callendine, the footpad who robbed
the electric-car barn in Sacramento last
Christmas, haa led to the supposition on
the part of the prison authorities that an
extensive jail- break was in contemplation.
It is claimed that the key was so cun
ningly wrought that it would unlock every
cell in the tier, and thus liberate a score or
more of desperate criminals.
The key is supposed to be the handiwork
of Bandit Brady, and a search of the cell
has brought to light a collection of files
and a slungshot, which had been manu
factured from a piece of rubDer hose filled
with lead. The result, is that Brady has
retired to solitary confinement on a diet of
bread and water.
It is claimed that Brady's plan was to
wait until far into the night, when the
guards in that part of the prison were out
of sight, then, unlocking their cell door,
he and Callendine would have slipped out
and rapidly unlocked all the cells in the
tier, the locks on all being exactly alike.
The small army of liberated men would
have laid in wait for the puard, and when
he put in his appearance struck him down
before he could make resistance. They
would tnen have overpowered tbe guard
at the outer door, taken his keys from
him, and before the alarm could be given
many of the prisoners wonld have escaped,
because they would have managed to get
safely out of range while the guards were
shooting at others.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 1, 1896.
ENDS HIS CAREER
AT LOS ANGELES
Thomas Wylie of Oakland
Takes an Overdose of
Morphine.
TRAGEDY IN A HOTEL.
Leaves a Farewell Message to a
Woman Claiming to Be
His Sister.
"I LOVE YCTJ AS A BROTHER."
Nj Word for the One Whom He
Twice Wedded and Twice
Deserted.
Los Angei.es Office of the Call,)
328 South Broadway, V
Los Axgklks, Cal., Sept. 30.)
After a long career of dissipation,
Thomas Wylie ended his life at a lodging
house in this city last night by taking
an overdose of morphine. Wylie left a
note saying:
Fannie, good-by, I love you as a brother.
The whereabouts of "Fannie" is un
known. Wylie went to the lodging-house
last evening in company with a gentle
man who was unknown to the proprietor.
Wylie was found dead in his room this
forenoon. In bis pockets were two shoe
buttoners, one glove buttoner, with the
name "Kahn & Co., Oakland," upon it, a
gold watch, a mustache comb, a pocket
knife and 13 cents. He was wearing an
imitation diamond stud. He had several
letters from Mrs. A. E. Rae of Oakland,
one of which was dated September 18, and
two postal cards, in which a projected
trade of properties was spoken of, from
W. P. Tate, a rancher at Fairview. These
were aJI addressed to box 850, Pasadena.
In the room a quarter pound bottle of
sulphite of morphine was found. In his
Docket was tbe cork to this, showing that
he had taken an enormous dose. Upon
the Jioor was found the note to "Fannie."
Wylie was dressed in a suit of dark browa
clothes.
Wylie leaves a widow and three small
children in East Oakland, unless they
have removed recently. He formerly
owned considerable property on and about
Twenty-third avenue, but loss of business
and a reckless life absorbed most, if not
all, of it. Two years ago, after a trip to
New York State, Wylie returned with a
woman he called "Sister Fannie." His
unsophisticated wife admitted Fannie
into her borne, cooked and waited upon
her for several months, but finally her
suspicions were aroused and she sent both
Wylie and his "sister" away, soon after
ward securing a divorce from her recal
citrant husband.
Wylie and Fannie went to West Oak
land, and tbe former tried railroading for
a time. He then apparently deserted his
sister and remarried his former wife,
promising all manner of reforms. But it
seems that Fannie has never been forgot
ten. The deceased left no word to his de
voted but deserted wife.
HAD A HAPPY HOME.
Wylie Deserted a Kindly Wife and
Three Children.
OAKLAND, Cal., Sept. 30.â Tom Wylie
came to Oakland eight years ago from
New York State, and was known as a
hard-working, industrious man for hve
years, during which he saved considerable
money and invested it in property. About
three years ago he secured a young man
to help him, and when fairly in tbe work
Wylie took to drinking, and soon had
trouble with bis wife, a kindly disposi
tioned and attractive woman who had
made many friends. After she had se
cured a divorce because of the woman
â¦'Farinie," friends remonstrated in vain
when it was announced thai she would re
marry Wylie.
Mr?. Bessie Wylie is now living at
Selma, Fresno County, with her three
children.

STILL ON POINT WILSON
Efforts to Ascertain the Extent
of the Umatilla's Damages
Are Futile.
Lighthouse â  Keepers Admit That S
lent Foghorns Caused the
Disaster.
PORT TOWNSENI), "Wash., Sept. 30.â
The steamship Umatilla is resting easily
on the beach a few hundred yards from
the Point Wilson lighthouse. Both bow
anchors are embedded in the sand on
shore and by a cable fastened to the
steamer. This holds it steady, though
the vessel is listing considerably to the
starboard.
A diver made two unsuccessful attempts
to-day to locate the place where the plates
were torn off. A light swell and the un
steady condition of the vessel prevented
the diver from accomplishing his object.
A board of surveyors this afternoon ex
amined the vessel and will probably re
port in a day or two. The freight is
being rapidly removed to the dock and
everything being got in readiness to facil
itate the diver's efforts to locate the leaks.
The chances are about even whether
the vessel can be pumped out and the
holes temporarily closed until she can
retch a drydock. If the weather continues
favorable it may be possible to save it
It is now known positively that the fog
whistles on Point Wilson and the Race
Rocks were not blowing on the night of
the disaster. This is now admitted by tbe
keepers, who say that it was owing to the
water necessary for steam purposes hav
irg been exhausted. For the past three
days the whistle on the Race Rocks has
been silent for the same cause. This,
together with the ebb ide.was what threw
tbe pilot nearly a mie off his reckoning,
and while trying to locate Point Wilson
signal he ran tbe steimer in among the
rocks abreast the old wreck of the bark
David Hoadley.
Six minutes from tie time she struck
the waters reached the furnaces and
quenched the tires. The firemen were
nearly suffocated by he scalding steam
and hot water and aaties. It was by the
greatest luck the Unatilla reached the
shore. Had the distance been fifty feet
greater she would lave foundered in
twenty fathoms of waier.
When the ship strucc the reef all of the
doors leading from oÂ»e to another of the
compartments were ojen and during the
excitement the crew fcrgot to close them,
and that was what ciused the vessel to
fill so rapidly.

PELAGIC SEALING
IN BERING WATERS
Results of the Investigation
by the United States
Commission.
REPORT OF DR. JORDAN.
Finds That Fur-Bearing Herds
Are Steadily Decreasing
in .Number.
RESULT OF KILLING FEMALES.
The President of Stanford Tells of
the Success of the Northern
Voyage.
SEATTLE, Wash., Sept. 30.â Dr. David
S. Jordan, head of the Behring Sea Com
mission for tbe investigation of the fur
seal question, arrived in Seattle to-nisht
on the City of Topeka, in company with
Fred A. Lucas of the same commission
and Professor D'Arcy W. Thompson,
head of the British commission. Dr. Jor
dan and Mr. Lucas left at once for San
Francisco, while Professor Thompson will
spend several days in Victoria. Of tbe
other members -of tbe American commis
sion Captain J. F. Moser of the Albatross
and Dr. Leonhard Stejneger are still on
the Japanese coast, whither they have
gone for the exploration of the Japanese
fur seal islands; Charles H. Townsend is
in San Francisco engaged in collection of
statistics, and George A. Clark and Colonel
Joseph Murray remain to record the
breaking up of the rookeries on the
islands. The following prepared state
ment was given out by Dr. Jordan for
publication :
Dr. Jordan and iir. Lucas report that they
are well satisfied with the work of the sum
mer. Every phase of the life and history of
the fur seal has been critically studied and all
points heretofore under dispute have been
settled beyond cavil. The first detailed cen
sus of fur seals Has been made and the first
complete examination of the various causes
of their death. The conclusion reached last
year by Mr. Townsead in the study of killing
seals at sea have been confirmed in every par
ticular. A detailed report of the work of the
summer will be sent at once to the Treasury
Department.
There is still a vast Dody of fur seals on the
islandsâ more than the commissioners were at
first lea to expectâ but the number is steadily
declining. The only cause of this decline is
the killing of females through pelagic sealing.
The females are never molested on the islands,
but three-fourths of those killed in Bering Sea
are nursing lemales. The death of the mother
causes the death of the yonng on shore, so
that for every four fur seals killed at sea,
three pups starve to death on shore. As each
of those females is also preenant, a like num
ber of unborn pups is likewise destroyed.
Pelagic sealing as an industry has already
cut its own throat, as the fleet this year will
not pay expenses. The killing of surplus
young males, as provided for by law, is ana
has always been a benefit to the herd.
The commissioners believe that the way is
open to an honorable and amicable settlement
of this question in a manner satisfactory alike
to the United States and England and to Cana

THE CONGRESS MINE DISASTER.
Weather Bureau Chief White Was Crushet
to Death Under a Run
away Car.
PHGENIX, Ariz., Sept, 30.â Full partic
ulars of the death of Arthur L. White by
accident in the Congress mine on Monday
were received yesterday. White was chief
of the United States Weather Bureau in
Phceuix, coming from Columbus, Ohio,
last summer. He went to Congress to
establish a voluntary observation station
and was exploring the mine with his wife
and Shift Boss Bartholomew when the
accident occurred.
The mine is on one side of a mountain
ledge, dipping at an angle of about forty
degreed. The working shaft is an incline,
tbe ledge down 1700 feet, cars being handled
by an engine on the surface with cables.
The mine is worked by lateral drifts or
levels, following the ledge on each side of
tbe incline. White's party was ascending
from the lowest level and when at the
1200-foot level a car being loaded at the
400-foot level broke loose and rushed down
the incline upon them. Bartholomew
heard it in time to catch Mrs. White and
spring from the car to the side of the in
cline and they escaped with slight injur
ies. White was crushed and instantly
killed in the collision before he could
leave the car.
Just how the car eot away and the cause
of the accident is not known. The man
agement has always been very careful and
accidents were rare. White was buried in
Phoenix yesterday evening.
OREGON KAOLIN DEPOSIT.
Discovery of a Mine of the Clay Used in
Making Fine Chinatvare.
PORTLAND, Ob., Sept 30.â A party of
Portlanders, while prospecting in Eastern
Oregon recently, came across a bed of
kaolin, the clay from which the finest
chinaware is made. Claims were staked
out, the locators being F. C. Brody, Her
bert Baker, C. W. James and J. H. Bur
gard.
Samples of the kaolin were sent to a
Delaware pottery, one of the largest in
the United States, with the request that
tbe clay bo worked into chinaware. With
the return of the ware came letters from
the potters asking as to the extent of the
field and its distance from rail communi
cation. They said that the quality of tbe
clay was fully equal to that formerly im
ported from England and in which coun
try they were forced to place their sole de
pendence. The letter concludes with a
proposition that a stock company be
fermed and the kaolin mined in a sys
tematic manner.
The mines are five miles from Hunting
ton, the deposit apparently being inex
haustible.
San T.uit Obispo Explosion.
SAN LUIS OBISPO, Cal., Sept. 30.â A

house seventy-five feet distant, driving it
completely through the roof. Fortunately
the men on the engine had gone but a
few moments before, and none were hurt.
The explosion was heard a long distance

READ THIS LETTER.
San Francisco, Cal.,
September 25 1896. -
â  I, Mrs. Agnes Feely, living aij
Silver Heigh ths, San Francisco^
desire to say that I brought my
child, Agnes, aged 12 years, to
the office of Dr. ; F. L. Sweany
737 Market street, S. F., s hei
being afflicted with a malady of
the right eye. I had previously]
taken her to our family doctor,
who said he was at a loss to say
what the precise trouble was, or
how to remedy it. Doctor
Sweany at once stated \my
cnild's case to be one of kera-
titis. My child was totally blind
in that eye at the first visit
September ; 18, 1896. Now; on
September 25, she can see .per- "-'
fectly out of the eye. I heartily ;
appreciate the rapid cure of this!
serious eye affection, a great!
matter for a child anxious to!
pursue school studies, and I
have offered to 'testify this much
on behalf of kindness and skill
so effectively rendered by Dr.
Sweany.
MRS. AGGIE FEELY,
Silver Heights, City.

and unsolicited testimonials on

testimonials will be published
without ; â¢ request from' patient.
All dealings and correspondence
strictly confidential. Any suf
ferer in doubt should see some

SEATTLE, Wash., Sept. 30.â Concern-
I ing the discussion of political questions
p by California college and university pro
Â§ lessors, especially in San Francisco, Dr.
i Jordan said:
"I regret that circumstances seem to
â  have brought Stanford University promi
? nently into the political discussion. The
* work of a teacher is investigation rather
| than persuasion. No one has a right to
I speaK for the university in any matter of
I opinion, and each man as a private citizen
I is perfectly free to take any stand in
politics he may choose. So far as my per
sonal views are concerned, I do not believe
that National prosperity is waiting on
any legislation. Its elements are stability
of conditions and personal industry. I
cannot see my way at present to favor free
coinage of silver, and I am wholly op
posed to any movement that tends to
range class against class in our country.
Just now my constituents arc all fur seals,
and they are all for protection."
Dr. Jordan is much surprised on his re
turn from Bering Sea to find from vol
uminous correspondence awaiting him at
Seattle that many of his friends have
taken seriously an article in the last Pop-
lar Science Monthly on "Sympaycho-
I graph." The article, descriptive of a
mental photograph of a cat, was intended
simply as a satire on the easy credulity of
the public concerniug newspaper science,
if the subiect-matter is startling or un
canny. It never occurred to the author
that any one could taKe the article seri
ously. Roentgen's experiments and re
sults are genuine, but the English imi
tators referred to by Dr. Jordan were
self-deceived, and eager to see their names
in print. Mental photography, he avers,
is still a myth.
RALLY A.T HBALI>BBURG.
Farmers of Sonoma County Applaud
Congressman Barhatn's Words.
HEALDSBTJRG, Cal., Sept. 30.â
business thoroughfares of this city were
ablaze with the light of bonfires to-night,
and the town was thronged with country
folks who came from far and near to
listen to the speeches delivered bj--*j A. :
Barham, Republican nominee for Con
gress, and W. R. Davis of Oakland. It
has been years since Trout's Opera
held such a large audience, and never be
fore was more enthusiasm displayed at a
political gathering. Men who grow wool
and raise stock came in from points
twenty or thirty miles away, and to-night
one would - scarcely believe that Healds
burg was once the Democratic stronghold
of Sonoma County.
A large number were â¢ unable to gain
admittance to the theater, and when E.G.
Hall, president of the Republican club in
this place, called the meeting to order,
fully 1500 people were crowded into the
building. The introduction of Barham
was the signal for great enthusiasm, and
as he proceeded to give an account of his
stewardship as a Congressman he was
frequently cheered. He spoke at length
on the financial issue, but said silver was
of minor importance when considered as
against tariff legislation.
'What we want," he declared, "is to
give the farmer a market for his produce.
This we can do by giving the laborer em
ployment. Let us put some of the money
we now have into circulation by starting
up mills and factories. McKinley will do
this."
W. R. Davis closed the meeting in an
eloquent and logical speech.
BRIAX MrX SCARCE.
The Situation <n Michigan as Described
in n Letter.
BAN DIEGO, Oat,., Sept. 30.â Senator D.
L. Withington received the following letter
to-day from J. A. Jon^s, who is backing
the Ocean side irrigation system:
Bay City, Mich., Sept. 22. 1896.
D. L. Withington Esq., Han Diego, Cal.â Dear
Sir: Times here are simjÂ»,y iÂ» U rful. In this
little city alone failures involving over $8,
--000,000 have ocenrred. The people are alive
to the present issue. Some go m> far as to
claim the State ior McKinley by 100,000. I
was here two years ago when Governor and
Congressmen were elected by such a decided
vote, and there was not then any such a show
ing as they are making now. Private resi
dences of poor and rich are decorated with
McKinley pic.ures. I want to get back to
California to do some work if possible. Every
body is talking politics. Bryan buttons are
scarce, and when a man appears in a crowd
â wenrine one, they say : "Poor man, he is wrone
under his hat." 1 met in Chicapro F. H. Pond
of the Pond Engineering Company, St. Louis,
and he says Missouri will go for McKinlev.
Yours, very truly, J. a. Jones "
LOS ANGELES DEMOCRATS.
JUagulre and Whit* Address a Free-
Silver Gathering.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Sept. 30.âCon
gressman J. G. Maguire of San Francisco
addressed a large body of people in the
free-silver wigwam here this evening.
Senator White was chairman of the
meeting and spoke before Maguire reached
the tented enclosure. The Senator made
no allusion to his combination with T. V.
Cator, a former opponent of his, to con
trol two sessions of the California Legisla
ture in the interest of themselves.
Judge Maguire was in good voice and
spokÂ« for over two hours with great dis
tinctness and deliberation. Besides the
common, every -day platitudes of the
I'opocratic stump-apeakers in this cam
paign, he devoted much time in exposing
alleged inconsistencies of leading Repub
licans of Calilornia on the silver question,
naming General Barnes, Irving M.Scott,
Morris M. Estee and Congressman Mc-
Lachlan. Tne speaker devoted much
time to the Pacific roads funding bill, de
claring that "if Bryan is elected you will
never hear anything more from Hunt
ington on that matter."
San Jose's Sound- Money League. *~
SAN JOSE, Cal., Sept. 30.â A branch of
the California Bound-money League was
organized this evening by a number of the
representative business men of til is city.

Tirey L. Ford, ex-Senator of this district,

TRAINING CA RRIER PIGEONS.
Two Large Itorecotes to Be Stocked by
the Government.
PORTSMOUTH, N. H., Sept. 30,-Some
time ago the Navy and War departments
decided to train carrier pigeons for use in
case of war. The station at Newport,
R. 1., and thi3 navy-yard were selected for
thÂ« purpose. A large dovecot is being
erected, and a large coop of the finest
birdi of the carrier breed will be kept
here. A navy officer will be assigned to
care for them. It will be the practice to
ship the pigeons several hundred miles
a>vay and to let them return by wing to
the coop at the yard. The headquarters
will be arranged at once. The building will
be of the latest design and suitable for
pigeons every way. It is believed that the
carrier pigeon will prove a valuable mes
senger in time of war in communicating
from the sea to land.

GRAFTON, W. Va., Bept. 30.â William
J. Bryan's special train arrived here at
11:10 p. m., three hours late. The trip
Irom Cumberland to Keyser was made via
the Central tracks on account of a Droken
bridge on the B. and O. road. The neces
sity of changing back and a disarranged
schedule caused thÂ« delay. Mr. Bryan
addressed larpe and enthusiastic audiences
at Cumberland and Keyser. Ex-Senator
Harry G. Davis, the father-in-law of Sena
tor Elkins, introduced him to the crowd
gathered at Kevser in an open field in
closed by picturesque bluffs. Mr. Bryan
in his speech referred to the ex-Senator'a
support.
Small crowds which showed great en
thusiasm greeted Mr. Bryan at Piedmont,
W. Va., Oakland, Md., and Terralta, W.
Va., the last-named place at the highest
point touched by the B. and 0. road in
the Alleghenies." Although the hour he
arrived here was so late Mr. Bryan decided
not to disappoint the people who had
been waiting for him so long and made
them a speech, after which he retired for
the night, preparatory to starting lor
Clarksburg at 6 o'clock in the morning.
Pickpockets followed the Bryan train
all day and reaped a rich harvest in the
crowds. Senator FaulKner lost his purse
at Martinsburg. Sixty dollars was taken
from Colonel Fitzgerald, Populist candi
date for Governor. At Cumberland Sen
ator Davis was robbed. It was reported
on the train that left Keyser that a man
had been stabbed and killed there in a
political quarrel.

FOB PKESIDENT-
WILLIAM McKINLEY, of Oiilo
FOB TICF-PRESIDENTâ
GARRET A. HOBART, of New Jersey
Election November 3, J896.
Victory is in plain sight.
Regular Republicanism triumphs.
The motto of Democracy is "Nit."
The kickers now can only kick them
selves.
The State Committee has settled the
question.
Between Buckley and Rainey there is no
choice for decency.
What does the respectable Democrat
think of his party in this town?
Follow the Republican procession and
you will reach a good municipal adminis
tration.
The only thing left to do is to down the
Democratic factions and redeem San
Francisco.
As a matter of fact is it not your duty
to vote for protection to the industries of
California?
About all that Willie Hearst is looking
for in the Democratic camp in these days
is a chance *o bolt.
What would it profit a good Democrat
to help Rainey beat Buckley or to help
Buckley beat Rainey ?
The Republican party has its factions,
but in the Democratic camp it is the fac
tions that have the party.
Buckley and Rainey are right in one
thing. The only way to get the discord
out of their camp is to fight it out.
Municipal politics means business, and
now what business have either of the rival
Democratic bosses in this municipality?
The talk about capital coercing labor to
vote for the plain interests of labor is the
rawest roorback ever known in any cam
paign.
Trade is waiting simply for the cam
paign to get out of the way. There will
be a big and booming revival as soon as
McKinley is elected.
As not a single California industry has
been benefited by Democratic legislation
why should any Californian vote to con
tinue such legislation?
The Rainey Democrats are reaching for
the Non-Partisans and the Buckley crowd
is reaching for the Populists. There is no
end to the gall of either faction.
John Boyd Thacher's eminence in poli
tics was brief ana fleeting, but it was long
enough to satisfy the people of New York
and he will never be eminent again.
Between the Buckley machine and the
Rainey machine the respectability of the
Democratic party begins to look as if it
had passed through a sausage factory.
There is but one Republican ticket in
Ibis Cityâ that is the ticket headed by
Colonel Jharles L. Taylor. Now then,
loyal Republicans, get in and work for it.
Now that the "push" is fighting and
the "pull" is wrangling, good citizens
have their chance. Let us elect Colonel
Taylor and his ticket and make a clean
sweep of the bosses.
There are comparatively few people who
are paying any attention to the row in the
Democratic camp. It seems to be of no
more interest to the general public than a
dog-fight in the streets.
More than one-third of the iron and
Eteel of the world i* made in the United
States. The industry was built up under
protection. Are you in favor of promot
ing it or of destroying it?
The better element of the Democratic
party in this City seems to have abandoned
the attempt to redeem it, and the whole
thing has been thrown away like a bone
for the dogs to mouth over.
Although the Populists caston] ya DOt it
one per cent of the vote of New York four
years ago they are now strutting about
patronizing the Democrats and promising
to help them carry the State over the gold
men.
The extravagance of Bryan's speech is
sometimes excused on the ground that
he is an earnest and sincere zealot; but if
that be his character how is it that he
evades and dodges his record on the tariff
question whenever he is asked about it?
The best political experts are now sure
that the election of McKinley is certain,
and the only thing to be wonted for is to
make the defeat of Bryanism so complete
that no party will ever dare again to make
each an issue in the politics of the country.
COMPLETE VICTORY.
The claim of the Auditorium convention
to represent the Republican party of San
Francisco has been confirmed beyond
further dispute. The State Central Com
mittee, following independently the pre
cedent set by Registrar Hinton, has de
cided with but a single a dissenting voice
that it was the only rightful Republican
convention in San Francisco, and that the
ticket nominated by it is entitled to the
support of all loyal Republicans.
The decision given by the committee is
a victory for regularity. It ia a victory for
law. It is a decision that was foreseen
from the beginning by every man who has
any intelligent knowledge of party govern
ment in this country. The State Commit
tee being composed of impartial Republi
cans could not have done otherwise than
it did. The law and the equities of the
case were all on the side of the Audito
rium convention.
The result of the contest is of more than
local Importance. In making this fight
John D. Spreckels was fighting for organ
ized Republicanism all over the State.
His battle was the battle for the whole
party, and the Republican organization is
to-day stronger in every section of Cali
fornia, by reason of the success gained
through his straightforward, honest and
fearless leadership. He stands the recog
nized and victorious champion of the party
organization everywhere.
It is not likely there will be any further
dispute over this question, which should
never have been disputed at all. As The
Call pointed out from the beginnin g there
was never any real doubt of the right of
the claim of the Auditorium convention.
It is well enough, however, that it should
have been decided by the highest author
ity of the party in the State. It has now
been decided. Let us hear no more con
tentions in Republican ranks. Let us
unite and go forward to victory.
Some people say that the tariff question is
settled. It is settled, I grant you, in the
minds of the American people, and it is set
tled on the side of a genuine American pro
tective policy. But settling a question in the
minds of the American people does not settle it
in public law until the people have voted that
way and given us a protective Congress. â
McKinley. ____^_______
THE REPUBLICAN TICKET.
The Republican local and legislative
ticket reprcents the best elements in the
community's business and social life, while
the platform of the party declares em
phatically for those principles of govern
ment which are known to be most con
ducive to the general good of the peo
ple. It is of the highest importance
to all interests that Colonel Taylor be
Taylor and his associates on the ticket be
elected. Laying aside the ethical phase
of a proper administration of the public
concerns of the people, San Francisco
more especially is in need of a strong and
fearless business administration. There
are vast industrial and commerc al en
terprises which need to be made to feel
that they will have that encouragement
which comes of faith in the ability and
integrity of those who make and ad
minister law, so that they may not hesi
tate to multiply the volume of their
operations.
With an administration that gives assur
ance in advance of honest purpose there
would be substantial increases in invest
ments in active business, as well as in
property improvements, to establish fixed
incomes; but such assurances can only
be given by selecting men for public
office whose names themselves would be
ample guarantee of a prudent and thor
oughly honest administration. If that
shall be done trade and traflic will take
courage and widen and deepen the chan
nels oi : their going and coming and ex
tend tne territory of their distribution. A
common-sense business administration is
what San Francisco needs.
With Colonel Taylor at the head of the
municipal government the community
would feel safe in its property and individ -
nal rights, and to secure them in full is
the ultimate purpose of a wise and
sound administration. Colonel Taylor is a
consistent Republican, but as Mayor, he
would be above political environment and
give the people an administration that
would be conspicuous for honest effort to
better the conditions of business and social
existence.
The way to restore confidence is to defeat,
through the badot, the party that destroys
confidence. The way to restore prosperity is
to defeat, through the ballot, those who have
destroyed prosperity. We cannot restore the
business of the country so long as we do so
much of our business abroad. Let us bring it
back home again for. our own people and our
own labor. â McKinley.
OBEDIENCE TO AUTHORITY.
The State Central Committee having
confirmed and ratified the regular Repub
lican nominations, there remains no
ground for any one to offer as an excuse for
not giving hearty and loyal support to the
ticket headed by Colonel Taylor. The
proceedings leading up to the nomina
tions have been pronounced legal and in
conformity to the usages of the Republi
can party, and the same decision makes it
incumbent upon every Republican to
cheerfully acquiesce and give his best
service to the cause for which the ticket
stands and represents.
However widely different opinions may
have been as to how the party could best
be served, there is now no valid reason
why any one should hesitate to indorse
the work of the convention and take his
place in the line of battle and fight for
victory. The Republican party stands for
principles of government and not for in
dividual political advantage. Tne party
is greater than the individual, but it can
not apply its principles unless its rank
and file stand together In harmony. Nor
need victory be expected unless there is
not only willing but hearty recognition of
the authority of those selected by the
party as a whole to direct the general
movement.
The decision of the State Central Com
mittee was not made In haste, nor did
personal likes or dislikes enter into the
deliberations. It was a question of evi
dence based upon the customs of the
party, and in confirming the regularity of
the "Taylor ticket" the committee simply
did what was required of it under party
usages. But it is not now a question of
faction or misunderstanding. All that
has been settled by an authority which
every true Republican will gladly recog
nize and willingly obey.
The success of the Republican party in
all past contests could be traced directly
to the narmony which existed between
the several committees themselves, and
between them and the rank and file; but
there can be no harmony, and certainly
no victory, if good feeling and singleness
of purpose do not prevail throughout the
party. We believe that every Republican
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 1, 1896.
can be counted upon to do his best for the
success of the party, and if that feeling
prevails the issue will resolve itaelf into
the question of how large the majority
shall be.
The further the canvass progresses the
plainer the result becomes. The American
people are using their minds and conscience,
and the mind and conscience working to
gether make few mistakes. They are looking
at the candidates and reading their utter
ances day by day, and every utterance of
William McKinley increases their admira
tion and their trust. Every utterance of
William J. Bryan confirms the thoughtful
man in his first impressions of unsafely, and
causes the thoughtless to halt arid carefully
consider the end of the journey upon which
he is invited. â Hon. F. S. Black of New
York.
STOP FIGHTING.
Stop fighting. The time has come for
Republicans to unite for victory. The last
controversy in the party in this City has
been settled by the decision of the State
Central Committee. This is the highest
authority of the Republican party in the
State. There should be no question of re
volt against its decision. All Republicans
should loyally support the tictcet which it
has indorsed and enter vigorously upon
the work of electing Colonel Taylor Mayor
of San Francisco.
The men who in this contest have been
supporting the Republican committee of
which Mr. Manwaring is chairman and
the convention over which Mr. Riordan
presided have set the example which
their opponents should now follow. They
have frankly consented to the withdrawal
of their candidates for Elector and for
Congress in the Fourth District and are
now cordially supporting Mr. Spear for
Elector and Mr. O'Hrien for Congress.
They are doing this because thay are Re
publicans, because they stand for party
loyalty, party harmony and party victory.
They have no intention to continue the
fight in that district except as Repub
licans united against the foes of the party.
The example thus honestly and loyally
set should be as honestly and loyally fol
lowed. Mr. Sonntag, Mr. Ruef and their
friends have now an opportunity to show
the sterling character of their Republi
canism. Let them accept the decision
that has been given against them without
further attempts at prolonging the dissen
sion. There can be no humiliation in bow
ing to the decision of the State Central
Committee. Every Republican must do
that. The way to party harmony is open
to them, and when they join the ranks
and take part in the battle they will have
a share in the victory in November.
My fellotc-citizens, it does not make any
difference how free silver is in its coinage in
the United Slates you will not get a dollar of
it unless you give something for it. If we
had mints in every State in the Union and in
every county of every State, and the silver of
the world was brought to those mints as is
proposed by our political opponents, silver
would not be any. freer for you than it is
now. â McKinley.
DEMORALIZED DEMOCRACY.
Ask any Democrat in California whom
his party would elect to the United States
Senate Ii it should have a majority in the
next Legislature. Ask any Democrat in
San Francisco whether his party is repre
sented by Buckley or by Rainey. The
answer to either of these questions will
show you how completely the party is
divided, how thoroughly it is demoralized.
Decent Democrats are dumfounded and
the "push" and the "pull" are going to
the "demnition bowwows."
It is not strange that these things are so.
For years past the better element of the
Democratic party has been steadily
crowded out of the party councils. This
year the crowding has been pushed to a
veritable stampede. Rival bosses have
divided the party into rival factions. De
cent Democrats can enlist under neither
Buckley nor Rainey. They must stand
aside and wait.
It would profit a good citizen nothing
to beat Buckley by the triumph of Rainey.
As little profit would be pained by revers
ing the process. The triumph of either
would mean the elevation to power of
some of the worst elements of the City.
There is nothing for respectable Demo
crats to do in local politics but to emulate
the patriotic example of those sterling
Democrats who in National politics have
resolved to free their party of Bryanism
by voting the Republican ticket this year
and showing the party bosses that they
must not go too far.
If the triumph of the bosses in the camp
has demoralized the respectable element
of the party the desertion of that element
has in turn bewildered the bosses. The
Buckleys and Raineys have counted on
the stalwart Democrats as "yellow dog"
men who would support the ticket under
any circumstances. They now see that
they were mistaken and as a result there is
confusion, discord and despondency in
both camps.
Demoralized Democracy has ceased to
be a power in this City. It is thoroughly
discredited. The bosses at war witb one
another can exert no force that the people
need fear if they have the wisdom to unite.
Why should good men take part in a
wrangle between such men as Buckley and
.Rainey? Why should not good Democrats
redeem their party by abandoning to de
feat and discomfiture the bosses and the
gangs that seek to disgrace it?

POINTED
QUESTIONS
Propounded to Senator
James J. Jones by a
Democrat,
Sophistries of the Chicago Plat
form and Its Candidate
Mercilessly Exposed.
The Chicago Tribune publishes the fol
lowing communication from William L.
Mitchell, a Democrat of that city, ad
dressed to Senator Jones of Arkansas,
chairman of the National Popocratic Com
mittee:
You are a Senator from Arkansas, which
State has given 70,000 or more majority for
the State Democratic ticket, and probably will
give the same amount for the revolutionary
repudiation National ticket, with the boy
orator as the Presidential candidate. This
was to be expected from a State thai, in 1829,
borrowed $500,000 of the United States, being
a fund bequeathed by Smlthson : an English
man, to the United States. Arkansas never has
paid the principal or interest, which to-day
would amount to $2,500,000. You repudiated
the above honorable debt then; you propose
now to repudiate one-half your debts oy pay
ing 50 ceivs on the dollar if free coinage of
silver is a success. Your State is consistent, I
might add, as your policy is to attack and de
stroy the credit and wealth ot the North, that
you are voting now as you shot in 1861. But
enough of this. You deceive the people will
fully and wickedly, as follows:
1. You know that 15 to 1 was the first ratio
in the United States, when silver was com
mercially worth as much as gold. You now
advocate a ratio of 16 to 1, when silver is
worth one-haif of whut it was then, is this
not intended to deceive? Do you state this to
the people?
2. You know that from 1792 to 1873 (the
criminal epoch) only about 8,000,000 of silver
dollars wens coined by the Government and
about 500,000,000 of silver dollars have been
coined since 1873; that no one would take
these silver dollars, and silver certificates have
been issued in their place and used as money
by the paopfe to pay dues and debts, private
and public, and are received by the Govern
ment for taxes, debts, etc. Do you state this
to the people?
3. In 1806, during Jefferson's administra
tion, by his order the coining of silver dollars
was stopped, and for thirty-five years, up to
and during Jackson's administration, not a
silver dollar was coined. Do you state this to
the people?
4. In 1834 the ratio was changed to 16 to 1,
the commercial value of silver being a little
less than gold, so silver disappeared and gold
became the standard; and in 1U53 silver was
iurther demonetized in the subsidiary coins
and we have been on a gold basis ever since.
Do you state this to the people?
5. In 1873 and for twelve years beforeâ i. c.,
from 1861 â the commencement of the rebel
lion, uot a silver or gold dollar was in circula
tion, and not one for five years after 1873 â
nothing but paper money was seen. Do you
state this to the people?
6. In 1873, when the "great crime" was
committed, as you say, while imposing upon
the people, no silver being in circulation, it
was considered of so little consequence that
the discussion for two years of the act which
passed in 1873 attracted little or no attention.
As early as January 13, 1874, Mr. Stewart said :
"There is nothing so satis. actory as the real
measure of valueâ gold." February 20 he
sa>>: "Gold is the universal standard of the
world Every one knows what a dollar
is worth." On June 11, 1874. referring, doubt
less, to the Paris conference, he says: "You
must come to the same conclusion that all
other people have that gold is recognized as
the universal standard ofvalue," On April 1,
1874, Senator Jones said : "I believe the scon r
we come down to a purely gold standard the
better it will be for the country. Did any
country ever accumulate wealth, achieve
Kreatuess, or attain high civilization without
a standard of value?" And what but gold
could be that standard?
Here were two â¢â silver" State Senators that
not only knew of the "crime of 1873," but
voted for it; yet you and others, to deceive the
people, say it was done secretly and was a con
spiracy with England, etc. It (the crime) was
not thought of until years afterward when
silver was declining on accountof the demone
tization of silver by every civilized nation and
tne immense production caused by the dis
covery of almost endless silver mines in the
United States. Do you state these facts to the
people?
7. You say, through your boy orator, that
silver by free coinage will again be worth
$1 29 per ounce and rns.ke the silver dollar,
with free coinage, worth 100 cents; that is
make silver, which is worth only in every
market of the world to-day 66 cents an ounce,
ai most double Its present value. Do you be
lieve this? Why, in 1890 to 1893, while the
Sherman act was in lorce, the Government
paid $50,000,000 (mostly In gold) for silver
bullion under the act yearly to tne owners of
the mines. Bllver declined from 121 to 80
cents an ounce during that time. How could
silver, then, without the aid of the Govern
mant, double its present value by free coinage
when it declined on a limited coinage when
purchased by the Government? The Govern
ment lost $150,000,000 in the purchases un
der the act of 1878 and 1890. Do you state
this to the people?
8. In 18v3 the circulating medium, gold,
Mlver and paper, amounted to less than
750 millions. It is now more than double that
amount. Do you state this to the people ?
9. You say the people want more money â
therefore, must have free coinage of silver.
The silver production of the United States and
of the world amounts to about 200 millions a
year. You have in the United States 600
millions of gold and about 400 millions of
national bank notes and other curreucy, mak
ing $1,000,000,000; all this would disappear
in the twinkling of an ey<~ if free coinage
takes place. Banks and holders would not
exchange a gold currency for depreciated
silver money, a 50 cent dollar. The mints
coin 40,000,000 a year; it would take twenty
years to coin an much money as you have to
day on a goid basis, and all that would be in
silver 50-cent dollars. Do you state this to the
people?
10. The manufactories, the great business
houses, all engaged in commerce and trade in
the United States, are opposed to free coinage.
The men who are carrying on all the great en
terprises aua improvements in the States are
opposed to free coinage, believing it will pro
duce bankruptcy, anarchy and ruin. Do you
state this to the people?
11. If all these business men who employ
millions of men are crippled and fail on ac
count of the panic caused by the timidity and
withdrawal of capital what will the millions
of idle men do? Will not the suffering be ter
rible in the extreme? Would it not produce
revolution and a reign of terror? Do you state
this to the people?
12. Do you t>ay you can revolutionize the
finances of this Government without a panic
that compared with lormer panics would be
like a cyclone to a summer breeze, which
would bankrupt the people and the Govern
ment? Do you say this to the people?
13. Do you say it is right to rob the creditors
to relieve the debtors? Who are the creditors
and debtors of this Nation? They are as
follows :
(a) Vast estates of widows and orphans in
vested in bonds.
(5) The banks of deposit are the debtorsâ
5000 millions.
(c) The 1000 savings banks are debtors to
their depositors 1800 million*.
(d) One million of pensioners are creditors.
(<) Risks in fire, marine, life end casualty
amount to over 25,000 millions.
(/) The laborer is a creditor for each day's
labor, amounting to minions every day. All
these deposits and premiums were paid in gold
or its equivalent; you propose to pay back in
50-ceut dollars. Suppose you bankrupt those
debtors by a panic, so they cannot pay at all.
Do you tell the people this?
14. You tell the farmer you will raise the
price of his product, but if you do you will pay
him in 50-cent dollars. You say you will raise
the wages of the laborer. How? Why, the
farmer says no; the p'.unterssay the wages are
too high already ; the railroads cannot raise
wages unless they double the fares; the mer
chant says he cannot pay his employes more
unless he marks up rls merchandise and
makes his customers pay more; the manu
facturer says he cannot pay his operators more
unless he charges the buyer more lor his man
ufactured goods. So where does the working
injiraancome in if he receives no more, and that
in 50-cent dollars, and has to pay double for
his food, clothing, etc. ? Do you tell this to the
people?
15. Can you keep silver on a parity with
gold with free coinage of silver ? No nation
has ever been able to do it, and England,
France, Germany, and every other civilized
nation abandoned it after changing the ratio
often, and as France did twenty times in fifty
years. Do you tell the Deople this?
16. We have bimetallism now; our silver is
kept on a parity with gold by a solemn pledge
of the Government. We have 500 millions in
silver, sixty times as much as we had before
1873. Do you state this to the people?
17. Is it not true that since the "crlmo of
â¢
1873" values of property have increased from
30,000 millions to 94,000 millions in 1890;
that the public debt was decreased during that
time one-half; that 120.000 miles of rail
road since 1873, costing 4000 millions of dol
lars, have been built; that hundreds of
millions of dollars have been invested in
manufactories and great, business enterprises:
that wages since that time have increased
more than one-half, and that, too, in gold ;
thut interest has been reduced one-half and
more? The rate of interest and the increase or
wages are proof that gold has not appreciated
and that it can buy no more than our silver
dollar to-day, the silver dollar being kept on a
pirity with 'gold.
18. Is it not true that the idle and restless
that make up a large portion of your party,
that array themselves ugainst the banks, tho
financiers, business and commercial men, and
capitalists, never drew a check or made a de
posit, and yet talk as glibly and intelligently
as parrots upon the simplicity and the princi
ples of finances at home and with foreign na
tions?
IN ITS USUAL STYLE.
Santa Ana Herald.
The San Francisco Examiner, with its usual
bombastic sensationalism, has foolishly used
most of its space recently In endeavoring to
prove that The Call and other Republican
papers have made a complete flop on the
money question. As a matter of fact, all the
papers on the Pacific Coast have always heen
in favor of bimetallism, and with the excep
tion of the Examiner, Los Angeles Herald
and Sacramento Bee all the principal dailies
are yet.
The Call, with its usual enterprise, has
brought to light the Examiner's sentiments
on the money question a few months ago, be
fore the Hearst estate, with its millions of
mining stock, had entered the combine of the
silver bullion producers. Then the Examiner
claimed that the free coinage of silver at 16 to
1 meant silver monometallism and said so in
the following words:
According to the present disputants the issue is
between the single gold standard and the free
and unlimited coinage of sliver at 16 to 1 without
international agreementâ in other words, between
gold monometallism and silver monometallism.
But the majority of the American people are bi
metalllsts.
Again, according to the Examiner, Bryan
will not secure 100 electoral votes. On Febru
ary 22 of this year it said:
It is idle to talk about nominating a man for
President whose views on the financial question
woi d suit ihe radical free-silver men of the
South and West. We must look at facts as tbev
are. and the undeniable fact In tills matter is that
such a m an could not command 100 electoral votes.
The Democratic party wants to go into the cam
paign to w ln, not to foilow Senator Stewart on a
dress parade; and to stand any chance of winning
we must have a candidate who will not alarm the
great centers of population t&at have the votes.
It also said, In the tame issue, in putting
lorth William C. Whitney, a strong "sound
money" man, for president:
Mr. Whitney (opposed to free coinage) favors
the largest use of sii/vkr that can be attained
without risking the stability of the National
finances, and this is the very utmost that the West
and South can secure. If the silver states stand
out for impossibilities they will simply block them
selves in a helpless minority.
These are only three ot dozens of quotations
from the Examiner that could be used to dem
onstrate that it was unequivocally oppdsed to
the free coinage of silver a few months ago.
Now, according to its own statements, it is ior
silver monometallism, while the Republican
papers it is so frantically endeavoring to im
pugn are for bimetallism, and are advocating
the only method by which sucti a policy can be
maintained.

MUSIC AND MUSICIANS,
Mile. Chamtaade, the well-known French
composer, tuned the tables very cleverly re
cently on a journalist who harassed her by
scathiDg criticisms. The chances of Parisian
life Drought them together one night in the
house of a mutual friend. The conversation
turned on music, and they had some lively
discussions on their preferences. Mile. Cham
inade, with some audacity, remarked that her
opponent's convictions 1 were not always on a
level with his knowledge. She resolved to
Mile. Cecile Chaminade, the French
Composer*
play a trick on him. Sitting down to the
piano, she said: "I will play you some frag
ments of 'Parsifal* and 'Tristan.' " "That is
something like music," he cried, "Ah 1 Wag
ner, what a genius." The young lady left
him to his enthusiasm, and never told him
that the fragments of "Parsifal" and "Tristan"
that she had played him were simply a few
bars of her own composition. She has told
other people, however, and no doubt the Joke
has reached the critic's ears by this time.
Gluck seems to be threatened with a pos
thumous popularity, second only to that
achieved by Napoleon a year or two ago.
Whole columns and pages of leading musical
journals are being devoted to : the composer of
"Orpheus, "and G luck's dreams, his ideals and
his disappointments are being discussed with
a tender and sympathetic regard which they
were , far from arousing during the poor fel
low's lifetime. The &on of peasants, born in
the forests of Bavaria, Gluck passed the early
years of his life in wandering from village to
village, with a violoncello on his back, and for
twenty-five years of his life as a composer he
wrote the scores of trivial. Italian operettas,
which have been forgotten. On the very eve
of writing his "Orpheus" an admirer sent him
an ode, beginning, "May you never cease to
make us laugh," and all the time Gluck was
dreaming of a very different ideal, for this
gamekeeper's son was the first poet musician
the world had seen. A century later Wagner
| was able to realize many of the ideals dreamed
of by Gluck, but he himself had not the liter
ary education to execute his reforms alone.
The first man who had the honor of being
associated with Gluck !in â  his innovations iin
the librettos of operas was what we call to-day
an amateur, one Rauiero de Calzabigi, Impe
rial Counselor at the court 01 the Netherlands,
who amused his leisure moments by writing
poetry. He was not a musician, but he loved
declamation, and he longed .to see ; opera
shorn of what he ' called ''Gothic ornaments"
in the shape of trills, cadenzas, ritornelli, etc.
Gluck agreed ; with him, and from this ex
change of L views sprang "Orpheus and Euri
dice," the work which constitutes I the evolu
â¢â ' i- -.' /"''"V'.k's genius. At present there is a
"TSE^?iÂ«^i^^s*.la&'tW* t opeiÂ«, and It Is among
the \v orks billed for the metropolitan . season
this year. If the craze for Gluck continues no
doubt his greater work, "Alceste," will become
the fashion also.
"The art of singing Mozart has been lost," so
say most of the critics who have attended the
revival of "Don Juan" at the Royal Theater of
Munich. I'ozart's chef d'eeuvre was to be
resurrected in aDsolute imitation of its first
performance at Prague in 1787, under the
personal direction of the composer. With this
object in view a small theater in the style of
Louis XV was used, the orchestra was limited
to twenty-four musicians, the first finale,
which is everywhere sung with about a hun
dred persons on the stage, as it represents a
revolution, was only sung at Prague by seven
persons, and seven persons sang it at Munich.
The simple recitatives accompanied only by
the clavecin were also restored, but one thing
could not be resurrected, and that was the
singing of Mozart's day. The soloists were all
so impregnated with Wagnerism that it was
found impossible to impregnate any of them
with the style of Mozart, and the director de
clared In despair that if he wanted Mozart
singers he would have to start with beginners
and educate them on purpose, for that not a
vocalist before the public to-day could boast
of singing with the school necessary for
rendering Mozart.
Apropos of "Cinderella," which Massenet Is
to produce tnis season at the Opera Comique,
it may be stated that over 100 pieces have
sprung from the slipper of this celebrated laay.
Rossini wrote one, "La Cenerentola," which
would be almost forgotten to-day if it were not
for one grand aria it contains. The first "Cin
derella" known to the stage was a vaudeville,
which Anseaume wrote in Paris in 1759 and
Konette set to music The vaudeville was
based on actual lact, lor Tavenard, a well
known singer of the period, happened one day
to be passing a cobbler's shop when he noticed
a charming little slipper which had just been
resoled. He was so taken with its smallness
and dainty shape that he fell in love with the
unknown owner, managed to find out who she
was and married her.
Abbey, Schoeffel and Grau have completed
all their arrangements for opening the opera

night's bill and the artists announced for it
are Mme. Melba, Mme. Mantelli, Mile. Bauer
meister, Jean de Reszke, Edouard de Reszke
and Jean Lassalle, the celebrated barytone who
has not been heard on the operatic stage for
some years. In addition to singing Valentine
in "Faust" Lasselle will be heard in several of
his old roles, Including that of Nelusko, in a
revival of "L'Afric&ine." On that occasion
Calve will be heard for the first time in the
part of Selika. The opera announced for the
second night of. the season is "The Meister
slngers," with Eames in the part of Eva.
One has to read the foreign papers to get
freak news from home. This is Le Menestrel's
latest news from the United States: "The
Protestant minister of Pleasant Valley, United
States, and the faithful of his flock were
grieved and astonished the other day to find
that their btautif ul organ, which they had
paid for out of their own pockets, had disap
peared from the church. Some unknown
robbers had broken into the sacred edifice,
taken the noble instrument to pieces and had'
carried it away bit by bit But," asks Le Meues
trel, "what could these daring and original
brigands want with the organ?"
Le Menestrel says that just before leaving
England Li Hung Chang was treated to a con
cert of Scotch music. A whole band of bag
pipes played for him and a dozen or more
hardy mountaineers danced a Highland fling
in kilts. The old Chinaman was lost In ad
miration at the muscular development of the
Hignlanders, but the bagpipes aid not seem to
appeal to bis taste. A Scotch nobleman who
was in the party asked, "How does our na
tional music please your Excellency?" The
Mandarin, with a diplomatic smile, replied,
"Probably as much as our Chinese music
would please your Lordship." De gustibus,
etc.
The Emperor of Russia is a great lover of the
violoncello, which he does not play at all badly
himself. In Russia his admiration for the in
strument is well known, and whenever a con
cert is to be honored with his presence, the
managers never fail to put some violoncello
solo on the programme.
The Netherlandish Opera-house at Rotter
dam owes its iu:ids for the coming season to
an idea entirely new to operatic manage
ment. A committee, formed for tne purpose,
got up a lottery, ana 25,000 tickets were sold
at 2 francs each. The prizes consisted of a
hundrcl tickets for the entire season, and by

On his recent visit the Emperor of Russia
was very much pleased with the operatic per
formance prepared foi his amusement at the
Imperial Opera of Vienna; so much so. in fact,
that he bestowed a decoration on Dr. Hans
Richter, the first kapellmeister. On thinking
it over, however, this decoration did not seem
enough reward to satisfy his imperial Majes
ty's admiration, so he has just sent Dr. Rich
ter a gold cigar-case ornamented with the
Russian eagle in diamonds.
Richard Wagner was one of the most indus
trious letter-writers who ever lived. One
thousand eight hundred of his epistles have
already been published, and now it is an
nounced that a Viennese admirer of the Bay
reuth master is publishing a catalogues of all
the published letters written by Wagner be
tween the years 1830 and 1883. This cata
logue will contain the date of each letter, the
name of the person to whom it was addressed

LADY'S NIGHT GOWN.
The gown shown here is a shape that wears
extremely well, lor the part that usually gives
way first (the yoke) is made double.
It may be worn witn a small turn-over collar,
or may be trimmed with a large collar of the
goods or embroidery.
For muslin gowns a collar of the same with a
ruffle of Hamburg embroidery, sewed on with
an open work border, makes a neat and inex
pensive trimming.
A band of insertion with an open bead eago
let in between the ruffle and collar makes a
dainty looking gown. The insertion is. best
joined at the corners by cutting off square and
overhanging the edges together carefully. If
the pattern is in zigzag lines it is butter to cut
it cornerwise and join the edges in the same
way.
For dainty gowns of batiste the collar may
be exquisitely trimmed with a frill of Valen
ciennes or point de Paris lace, by rolling the
edge of collar between the thumb and fore
finger, and sewing the lace right on the edge,
the stitches holding the tiny roll and the lace.
It takes but a little patience to learn to do
this, and then one can make at home, at little
expense, comparatively (excepting time), very
exquisite gowns, such as come from the French
convents.
Heavy lawns, with a tiny dot in pink or blue,
are used for night dresses. Collars of plain
pink or blue lawn make a pretty trimming.

ANOTHER OCEAN
RECORD BROKEN
The Mail Company's China
Beat Her Own Best
Time.
On Ninety Tons of Coal a Day
the Vessel Made a Very
Fine Showing.
A QUICK BUN FROM HONOLULU
Two Sailors on the Cruiser Boston
Robb?d the Paymaster of $1000
and Then Deserted.
The officers and crew of the Pacific Mail
Company's steamer China were jubilant
yesterday. The good ship has again
broken her own record and with an aver
age of 16.7 knots an hour for over 2000
miles it easily beats any showing made by
vessels on the other lines.
From Yokohama to Honolulu the China
beat her own record by two hoars, her pre
vious best showing being 9 days 12 hoars
and 11 minutes. From Honolulu to San
Francisco she made the run in 5 days 8
hours and 29 minutes, beating the best run
on record from that port by 2 hours and 42
minutes. She was delayed off the Farall
ones for an hour by the foe and had a
little heavy weather leaving the port of
Yokohama. The showing made by tho
steamship from day to day was a remark
ably good one. Leaving. Yokohama on
September 15 she logged 343 knots the first
day out. That was about the "'. average
until September 24, when a run of 215
miles brought her into Honolulu.
The run from Honolulu was a particu
larly good one. Leaving port at 11:46 p. M.
on September 24 she made on the 25th
203 knots, on the 26th 382 knots, 27th 380
knots. 23th 393 knots, 29th 339 knots and
30th 337 knots, arriving in port at 9:44 a. m.
The runs were alt made on a consumption
of 90 tuns of coal a day and with an allow
ance of 125 tons a day the chief engineer is
confident that the vessel can . make 20
knots over a continuous run.
During the voyage Chief Officer Saun
ders was a very sick man. He began to
mend as soon as Honolulu was leached
and is now in fairly good health. Among
the passengers were: Miss Helen Stubbs
and Miss Theodora Stubbs, daughters of
J. C. Stabbs; Mrs. Tr. Cusbing", wife of
the well-known physician; Miss' T. A.
Fields, Professor J. M. Schaeberle, Dr. J.
E. Shuey and L. C. Master., the astrono
mers who went to Japan to view the
eclipse, and C. A. Spreckels. The latter
has been on a visit to Honolulu and says
he thoroughly enjoyed the trip. ; Mrs. F.
H. Frank also returned on the China.
She has been on a nine months' visit to
her sister in Japan, and is enthusiastic
over the beauties of the country.
The China brings the news that the pay
master of the Boston is a serious loser by
the cruise. While the vessel h was in
Shanghai he drew considerable money in
gold coin with which to pay various debts
contracted by the cruiser. 1 Two sailors,
named Hennckson and Mooney, learned
that the money was in the paymaster's :
room and soccecdeu in getting'aV&y with
' SiQQO oi it. . ill^f* ,to^ J$

The Occidental and Oriental Steamship
Company's Doric sailed for the Orient yes
terday with a heavy cargo and a full list
of passengers. Among those in the cabin
was Chung Liang Wong, Chinese Vice-
Consul at this port. ,
The officers on the Doric assert that on
their return trip they will easily beat the
China's record.; Captain Seabury and the
men on the crack Pacific Mail boat laugh
at the idea.
Goodall, Perkins & Co. have no further
particulars from the wreck of the Dma
tilla. Captain' Hunter wires that she is j
resting easily and will be got off. The
City of Puebla is the next vessel to sail for
the Sound, and the Mexico will take the J
Umatilla's place on the route. An investi
gation will be held at Port Townsend into
the cause of the trouble, and the blame
will be fixed where it belongs. From the
telegraphic accounts it appears that Cap
tain Hunter was using extraordinary pre-

cautions and that it was due to the inset
of the current that the vessel struck. â â¢â ;

Owing to the Rise in December
Grain.
The sharp advance in December wheat
yesterday caught Emil Meyer, a grain
broker and member of the San Francisco

failure is not a large one.
At the regular session of the Call Board
ais contracts calling for the delivery of

HOME PRODUCT AWARDS
A Partial List of the Fortunate
Exhibitors at the Big
Fair.
A. McLaughlm Is Not Satisfied With
tbe Action of Hie Managing
Directors.
There was a fair attendance of members
of the Dairymen's Union at the Home
Products Exposition last evening, buc in
some way or other the occasion became
known as Dockery night. Major H. E.
Alvord, chief of the Dairy Division of the
Department of Agriculture at Washing
ton, D. C. delivered an address. To-day
and to-morrow will be floral days. Three
prizes of $75, $50 and $25 will be given to
the florist presenting the three most orig
inal and beautiful designs. This evening
the Rev. Anna Howard Sbaw will deliver
an address on the signs of ttie times.
The judges of the exhibits have pre
sented a partial list of awards. In the
matter of awards A. McLaugblin of the
National Brewery believes that ne has a
just cause for complaint. He says that the
judges gave him the highest award, but
for some reason unknown to him the man
agers of the fair have gone outside ot the
judges', decision and have taken the mat
ter under p.dvisement in the interests of
the Fredericks burg Brewery. He proposes
to contest the case and probe the matter
to the bottom. The partial list of awards

once more for the excellent exhibit of hats
and caps at the Mechanics' Fair. As our
only manufacturing hatters this firm is
entitled to all the attention their exhibit

most select assortment of ladies', gentle
men's and children's bats and caps to be
found in the City.

Once more victorious! "The New Cali
fornia Range," which took the first prize
at the Mechanics' Fair and also at the Sac
ramento State Fair of 1895, has again car
ried off t!ie first prize for the best cooking
range for housebeld uses. These ranges
are made by Steiger & Kerr, and can be
seen at their salesroom, 138 Geary street,
where they also have a complete line of
hardware and household utensils.

One of the most attractive exhibits in
the Mechanics' Pavilion, particularly
worthy of the first prize which it has been

MUNICIPAL LEAGUE.
Wheelmen Complete Arrangements to
Their Big Parade Next Monday
Evening.
The Wheelmen's Municipal League held
a meeting last evening at the rooms of
the Imperial Cycling Club, Van Ness
r.venuc, to make final arrangements for
the big parade Monday evening.
Judge Kerrigan presided and P. J. Hyde
acted as secretary. J. W. Maguire was
added to the parade committee. A long
discussion took place upon a resolution
barring out all transparencies or other
advertising designs of candidates other
than the specially indorsed candidates of
the league. The opponents of the resolu
tion favored the exclusion of the adver
tisements of all candidates. The matter
was referred to the parade committee. A
test vote as to how the club stood on the
proposition was largely in favor of the ex
clusion of all advertisements.
The proposition to have "a night at the
Chutes" for the benefit of the campaign
fund was temporarily postponed.
The Yosemite Cycling Club was ad
mitted to membership in the League, with
E. D. N. Boukofsky, A. Heckendorf and
Phil W. Hammersmith as delegates.
The Associated Creditors of the City
presented a communication proposing that
they and the wheelmen unite on a slate of
candidates for Supervisors. The matter
was laid on the table.
POLICE REVIEWED.
The First Battalion Performs Various
Evolutions With Credit to the Men
and Their Officers.
The first battalion of the Police Depart
ment, consisting of eight companies from
the central district, had a dress parade on
Van Ness avenue yesterday afternoon.
Captain Wittman, who was mounted,
was in command of the battalion,
and the companies were com
manded by Lieutenant Uirdsall, Ser
geants Nash, Cook, Shea, Christiansen,
Tobin. Blank and Wolwebber. Those in
command of platoons were Sergeants Price
and Harper, Corporal Avers, Sergeant
Anderson, Corporal Gleason, Sergeant
Green, Corporal Sills and Patrolman
Adams.
Chief Crowley, in citizen's dress, was
mounted and, accompanied by Drill In
structor Marshall, who was also mounted,
watched the various movements with the
keenest interest, and seemed very well
pleased with the appearance and march
ing of the men.
Captain Wittman put the battalion
through different movements, including
marching in column of companies in
platoons and in fours, all of which were
done most creditably, and called forth the
enconiums of the spectators.

AN ECHO OF THE
BLYTHE CONTEST,
Sarah J. Carr Charges That
the Capitalist Left
a Will.
Attorney W. H. H. Hart Accused
of Making Away With the
Document
A $5000 LEGACY DEMANDED.
Judge Coffey Sustains the Defendant's
Demurrer and Tells Why He
Does So.
The litigation over the Blythe estate
seems interminable, and every month or
two a stray application, contest or de
murrer finds it way into Judge Coffey's
court The latest claimant of a share of
the capitalist's wealth is Sarah J. Carr,
administratrix of the estate of James E.
Carr, who, during the lifetime of Thomas
Blythe, was superintendent of some of
his Trinity County mining property.
Carr died not long ago and his widow
brought suit against \V. H. H. Hart for
$5000, claiming that Blythe left a will in
which he bequeathed that amount to her
husband, and that Hart, being named as
executor of the document and custodian
of it, concealed it so as to make it appear
that Biytbe died intestate.
Judge Coffey yesterday sustained a de
murrer Hart entered to the complaint,
and in so doing explained several nice
points of probate law. following Is an
extract of his Honor's decision:
This is a suit to fix upon the person of the
defendant a constructive trust by showing to
the court, sitting as a court of equity, that a
will was duly executed in which the defend
ant was named as an executor and in which a
particular bequest was made to the plaintiff's
intestate; that this fact was brought to the
knowledge of the defendant; that when the
fact was brought to his knowledge he was in
stituting a proceeding In rem to establish for
his own gain the intestacy of the deceased;
that it was his duty to disclose the fact of the
existence of the will, but that he fraudulently
concealed it for his own purpose until be had
established the intestacy by his proceeding in
rem and made it Impossible for the plaintiff
to take any probate proceeding to establish
the legacy. Plaintiff claims that the trust is
fixed upon the defendant by the fact that his
fraudulent concealment prevented the plain
tiff from taking any proceeding in rem.
Defendant demurs on the ground, mainly,
that neither count in the complaint states
facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action,
I think the demurrer should be sustained
and upon the basis of the demurrant's argu

ment, briefly stated, that the jurisdiction of
the probate forum to establish a will Is exclu
sive, whether the will has been lost or de
stroyed or has been fraudulently suppressed,
and a court of equity has no jurisdiction in
this state to grant relief in such a cause, either
directly or as an incident to jurisdiction over
other matters.
I have bestowed laborious attention UDon
the briefs and authorities cited in this conten
tion, but can find no support under bur sys
tem for the pretensions of plaintiff to equita
ble relief in tbe case stated in her complaint.
To entertain this complaint as statedâ to sus
tain the pleading so framedâ would lead to
grave complications and would destroy the
uniformity contemplated In the mode and
manner of proof and would be opposed to the
statute established by the constitution and
statutory laws of California.

PHELAN GIVES UP
TO SAM RAINEY
Abject Surrender of the
Supervisors to the
Big Boss.
After a Farcical Struggle Phe
lan Bows to Rainey and
Takes Up His Men.
THE JTJNTA CONVENTION ENDS
The Complete Domination of the
Stableman in the Examiner's
Wing of the Democracy.
The Junta Municipal Convention last
night nominated Supervisors and School
Directors named by Sam Rainey.
Rainev's ticket for Supervisors was swal
lowed by James D. Pnelan and the whole
"anti-Rainey" minoritvof the convention
with the exception of Max Popper, who
appears to have bolted.
Phelan. when offered the nomination,
declared with much brave determination
that he must have a pure, high-grade
ticket for Supervisors or he would refuse
tbe nomination.
But Rainey and his lieutenants "jollied"
things along, keeping a firm grip on about
eight of the nominees, and after much
highly important talk by Mr. Pnelan, two
or three highly important formal caucuses
and many private conferences, Mr. Phelan
last night surrendered to Rainey.
He agreed to the slate ticket at 7 p. m.
at a cancus at the Grand Hotel attended
mainly by Raineyites, and in the conven
tion the slate went, through flying, there
being opposition nominations in but two
district* and the contestants being buried.
The ticket nominated is as follows:
First Ward â Lawrence Devaney, bicycle
dealer.
Second Ward â Thomas H. Haskins, whole
sale merchant.
Third Ward â P. ML Delaney, with J. J.
O'Brien.
Fourth Wardâ John H. Pheehan, tailor.
Fifth Wardâ Dr. Washington Dodge.
isixth Wardâ John Wolf, wholesale liquor
merchant.
Seventh Wardâ Dr. T. A. Rottanzi.
Eighth Wardâ Frank C onKlin, carpet-beater.
Ninth Wardâ James E. Britt, plumber.
Tenth Wardâ Charles tiildea, Deputy Regis
trar.
Eleventh Wardâ Dr. C. A. Clinton.
Twelfth Wardâ Thomas W. Rivers, grocer.
This, with three exceptions, is tbe
ticket made out at a caucus of Rainey
followers neld at Rainey 's house on
Golden Gate avenue on Sunday evening.
That caucus met at 7:30 o'clock in Mr.
Rainey's parlor.
Refreshments measured a royal hospi
tality and Rainey tired nis face with
smiling. J. A. Fenton, Samuel Kohlman,
Eddie Grsney, Ed Lanigan, R. L. Mann,
ex-Senator Arms and others were present.
Henry Sutliffe, the cigar-dealer, was
agreed upon for the First Ward. Mr.
Sutliffe has been pulled down since, it is
currently said, at the behe-t of the Ex
aminer, that one of the Examinee's fa
vorites might be given a place. So the
manager of the late Examiner- Journal
relay race was put on as a concession to
one of toe lesser convention influences.
E. M. Burke, clerk at the Occidental
Hotel, was namea for the Fifth Ward at
the Rainey caucus. Mr. Burke found that
the nomination would conflict with his
business, and he withdrew , no Dr. Dodge
was fo'ind in his place last night.
The next change was in the Seventh,
where the simon-pure Rainey council
named E. J. Brewer.
Dr. T. A. Rottanzi had been looking
ardently for the nomination in the Tenth
and he was acceptable enough to Rainey,
but it was thought best Sunday night to
let Charles Gildea, president of tne Iro
quois Club, go in as one of the four or five
to be given to the anti-Rainey minority.
But Rottanzi and his friends hustled and
last niglit he was transferred to the
Seventh Ward and substituted for Brewer.
James E. Britt has been the especial
pet of the Raineyites and he was slated
lor his ward, the Eleventh. Phelan
rubbed his nose a good deal and rather
objected to Britt. Dr. C. A. Clinton's
iriends were mating a strong tight for
him in the Eleventh Ward in opposition
to Britt, and Phelan wanted Clinton.
Rainey stuck to Britt royally in the face
of great pressure, but yesterday Rainey
consented to let Clinton go in if Britt were
nominated in the Ninth, in place of P. D.
Mullaney. Phelan agreed to Rainey's
programme, and so Britt was la<t niglit
nominated from the Ninth, instead of from
his own ward.
In making out his slate Rainey turned
down a long string of good men who
sought the honor. Isidor Gutte was one,
for instance. The commodore's ambition
was keen, but be didn't try to buck fate
and Sam Rainey.
With the changes described the ticket is
the one the smiling stableman and his
retainers put up finaily on Sunday night.
And James I). Phelan came before the
convention last night, lauded it as being
the true stuff, and then this champion of
"purity" said: "This convention has been
controlled oy leaders, but not by the bad
and vicious," and Mr. Phelan, declared to
the City that Sam Rainey's Supervisors
would not be controlled by anybody.
The ticket for School .Directors was
named by an out-and-out Rainey com
mittee, and it was indorsed without a word
of discussion.
Tbe convention wound up its business
last night in a noisy session of two hours,
which Chairman Ãagan started at 9 o'clock.
The proceedings began with a victory
for Harry I. Mulcreevv, the candidate for
the Assembly in the Thirty-seventh Dis
trict. He nad been first nominated by the
Buckleyites and at a former session thÂ«
convention had instructed tue district
convention to nominate a man not on the
other ticket.
The chairman of the district reported
that Mr. Mnlcreevy had simply, been,
nominated again, and the boys cheered
the popular and defiant young nominee.
The convention was forced to accept Mul
creevy, and when Chairman- Ragan bad
made a Bpeech indorsing him the rules
were suspended and the nomination rati
fied.
The nominee made a speech amid much
loving disorder from his friends.
The report of the committee on nomi
nations for Board of Education, of which
Dr. Ragan was chairman, was read by
Secretary Saulmann. The ticket recom
mended was as follows:
Benjamin Armer, cigar merchant, 2815 Pine
street
Charles A. Bantel, baker and confectioner,
427 Larkin street.
Charles I_ Barrington, druggist.Marlret street
and Van Ness avenue.
Thomas A. Burns, produce merchant, 109
Seventh street.
Michael Byrne, dry-goods merchant, 1230
Green street.
H. A. Conrad, carpenter and builder, 623
California street.
James E. Derham, clerk with Lewis & Co.,
2108 Larkin street.
E. J. Gallagher, grocer, 2614 Bush street.
Edwin Hai trick, merchant, 2002 Golden
Gute avenue.
Dr. W. U. Sieoerst, dentist, 761 Valencia
street.
Dr. Thomas E. Shumate, physician, 2406
Suiter street
Samuel L. Waller, civil engineer, 2104 Bush
street.
There .was no discussion of the report.
It was quickly adopted and, on .motion of
W. P. Sullivan, the secretary cast the bal
lot for the nominees named.
"The next in order is the nomination of
Supervisors," said Chairman Ragan.
"Ah ! ab !" said the boys, as the fun of
the evening arrived.
Secretary Saulmann somehow began to
read a list of nominees, and he began,
"First Ward, Lawrence Devaney â "
As Mr. Devaney's name nad not been
presented to the convention, it was at
once seen that Mr. Sau<mann was starting
to read the slate and the convention
roared.
There was a brief hitch about how the
slate should be placed before the conven
tion, and then the nominations of the slate
men were made from the platform in suc
cession, in all cases but one the nomina
tions being at once made by acclamation.
Captain Foley nominated Lawrence De
vaney in a few words, and then Secretary
Saulmann, thinking that the names of as
pirants handed in a few days ago had
some significance, announced that Wil
liam Jordan was also bÂ«fore the conven
tion.
"Billy" hastened 10 say that his name
was withdrawn, and the slate had a clear
way. Devaney was named by acclama
tion.
James E. O'Donnell, the great nom
inator of the convention, named the slate
candidate for the Second Ward, Thomas
H. Haskins, the friend of Ed Lanigan.
Mr. HaskinÃ was quickly declared the
nominee. Haskins' name was loudly
cheered.
John H. Jerriman nominated the next
of the candidates especially approved by
Sam Rainey, P. M. Delaney, employed by
J. J. O'Brien & Co., who was named for
tbe Third Ward by acclamation, amid
applause by the majority.
Again came forth Joseph E. O'Donnell
to nominate another candidate from
Rainey's original slate. He named John
H. Sneehan of the tailoring firm of Flynn
& Sheeban, and the applause that rose
from tbe Rainey element continued until
there were "Three cheers for Sheehan!"; >
Charles Wesley Reed nominated Dr.
Washington Dodge for the Fifth, H. C.
Gesford named John Wolf of Wolf, Wree
don & Co. for the Sixth, Hugo K. Asher
I spoke for Dr. T. A. Rottanzi for the
Seventh, and Charles Wesley Reed named
Frank Conklin for the Eighth. All were
named by acclamation.
Then came the first of the two contests.
The transplanted James E. Britt, presi
dent of the Master Plumbers' Association,
was nominated amid loud cheering. But
the friends of P. D. Mullaney, who was on
the slate to be taken off, would cot ac
cept the inevitable, and he was nomi
nated by W. A. Breslin, amid cries of
"Britt!"
A tedious rollcall gave Britt 460 and
Mullaney 105, which shows what a slate
can do if necessary in a Rainey conven
tion even when a Mr. Mullaney is turned
down for a carpet-bagger at the behest of
the boss.
Charles Gildea was named when pre
sented by P. J. Tomalty.
E. P. E. Troy nominated Dr. C. A.
Clinton, and then John H. Grady and P.
J. Silk were put into the contest. Clinton
got 409 votes, Grady 110 and Silk 32. The
great majority stuck to the slate.
Thomas F. Barry nominated Tnomas
W. Rivers for the Twelfth Ward, and in a
minute he was indorsed.
Chairman Ragan announced that James
D. Phelan was present and ready to in
dorse the platform. The convention
cheered him loudly as he apptared. His
acceptance of Sam Rainey's boss-ship
made it easy for the boys to cheer.
Mr. Phelan indorsed every plank in the
platform, "especially since we have named
a worthy Board of Supervisors, who are
pledged in the platform to do their duty
to the people. I believe, from the char
acter of the men, that they will.
"Your leaders have taken me into their
confidence, and I have sat with them for
two day*. I believe that they are deter
mined to eive the people a ticket that will
become dear to the people. Municipal
government is a science and we must have
experts â men who will seek the beauti
ful as well as the useful. They will
perform their duties without dictation be
cause they have come out of a convention
which, though controlled by leaders, is
not controlled by the vicious and the
bad."
E. P. Mo^an, police court prosecuting
attorney and friend of Ed Lanigan, was
nominated for District Attorney.
The chairman and secretary were
thanked, and then there was a howl of in
dignant protest over a proposition to pay
$155 to the General Committee to pay its
debts, which finally carried, to the woe of
ail the sergeants-at-arms and secretaries
and their friends, who are entitled to the
residue of the $10 tax on nominees.
The following committee was named to
fill vacancies: Herbert Choynski, Dr. W.
J. O'Rourke, Joseph E. O'Donnell, George
E. Gallagher, Thomas W. X ;rce, and the
convention adjourned sine die.
PALMER PETITION READY.
The Sound-Money Democrats Are
Pushing Their Cam
paign.
The petition which will get the Palmer
and Buckner electors on the ballot was
completed yesterday by the Democratic
Sound-money League, and it will soon be
tiled with tbe Secretary of State.
There are just about 9000 names, several
nnndred more than were necessary. Most
of the signatures were obtained in San
Francisco by paid canvassers, but a great
number were secured by voluntary work.
Bunches of 100, 200 and 300 were received
from towns all over the State, from Eu
reka to San Diego. No attempt was made
to get any in Los Angeles, wnere tbe
sonnd-money Democrats are all out for
McKinley.
The League is now mainly at work on
the distribution of sound-money cam
paign literature. So far 80,000 pieces,
comprising ten publications, have been
distributed, mainiy in San Joaquin, Con
tra Costa, Sonoma and northern counties.
Tl:ey have gone to 13,000 individual ad
dresses, mainly of farmers. Sixty dis
tributing correspondents have received
100 copies of each document. The distri
bution through tne central and southern
portions of the State will now begin and
50,000 voters will be individually ad
dressed. A big ratification will bÂ« held
in San Francisco soon. It has not yet
been decided whether to put speakers in
the field.
Speaking To-Night.
A meeting under the auspices of the
California Silver Campaign Committee
will be held at Metropolitan Temple this
evening. It will be presided over by C. D.
Lane and the speakers will be A. C. Ellis
of Salt Lake City and M. A. Hurley. The
Press Club quartet will sing a number of
campaign songs. â¢
SHOT IN THE HAND.
Dudley Higgins and . Michael Kenny,
f Two i l.acinj Men. : Have Â» Fall- S'
Ing Oat. T ' : - : --\'' 'â ',
Dudley Higgins and Michael Kenny,
two racing men, had a dispute in a saloon
at the Ingleside racetrack last night about
money. Kenny claimed that Higgins
owed him $70, but Higgins denied the ob
ligation.
After they left the saloon the dispute
was renewed, and Kenny ran into another
saloon and borrowed a revolver. He went
hunting for Higgins, and as soon as he
met him he presented the revolver at him
and tired. Higgins instinctively held up
his right hand to protect his face and the
bullet went through the fleshy part of his
hand between the thumb and forefinger.
Kenny was arrested and charged with
assault to commit murder. Higgins was
taken to the Receiving Hospital.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 1, 1896.
PRETTY BOOTHS
IN THE ARMORY
And There Will Be Pretty
Faces In Them To-
Night
WHEN THE FAIR OPENS.
Ladies of Sacred Heart Parish
Are Ready to Hold a
Festival
AT PAGE AND OCTAVIA STREETS
The Hall Has Been Encircled With
Beautiful Stallsâ Some Inter
esting Features.
The large drill hall of the armory at
Page and Octavia streets has undergone a
wonderful transformation, and, instead of
bare walls and emptiness, there is now a
FATHER JAMES FLOOD of Sacred Heart Parish.
really bright and beautiful spectacle to be
seen there. And when the gaslights illum
inate the scene to-night many pretty
girls in pretty costumes will occupy a
prominent part of it, for then the grand
bazaar in aid of the Sacred Heart parish
will be open.
Ail day yesterday several of the leading
ladies of the Sacred Heart congregation
were busy in Armory Hall directing prep
arations for the festival, and a Jarge force
of carpenters and decorators worked hard
to complete the booths and stands. The
result was that at night tbe hall was en
circled with a continuous row of booths,
all facing on a line and decorated in a
great variety of delicate colors. A beauti
ful effect in white and pale green stood
beside a stall in lavender, pink and yel
low. No two were draped alike, so that
there was a good opportunity for the dec
orators to display their taste and versa
tility. Tbe general effect was artistic and
quite picturesque.
The festival will be opened this evening
by Supervisor Joseph Dimond, and with
out formalities or delay the good work
undertaken by the ladies will commence.
The fair;will remain open until October 17.
Quite a pretentious series of events has
been arranged. There will be hot lunch
daily from 12 to 2 o'clock, and refresh
ments will be served each evening from 7
to 10. For the entertainment of visitors
many pleasing surprises are promised in
the way of literary and musical exercises.
Then in the American booth there will be a
voting contest for President â McKinley or
Bryan â and in the League of the Cross
booth a contest for a handsome sword to
Ibe given the cadet officer having the

BURGLARS ARE BUSY
Residence on Sutter Street Entered and
Attempt Made to Enter Another
in the Mission.
The residence of Mrs. Lund on Butter
street, near Baker, was entered by two
burglars yesterday afternoon during her
absence. The glass in one of the rear
windows was broken and an entrance was
effected. The rooms were ransacked and
a lady's gold watch and chain and several
articles of jewelry were stolen. As soon
as Mrs. Lund returned and discovered evi
dence of the burglary she reported it to
the police. Two men who were peddling
potatoes in the neighborhood are sus
pected.
An attempt was made to enter the resi
dence of Frank Lemberger, 3470 Seven
teenth street, late Tuesday night. Lem
berger was downtown, and his wife was
reading, awaiting his return, when shortly
before midnight she heard the sless in the
dining-room window being broken. She
ran to the dining-room and saw a man in
the act of pulling his hand through the
hole in the window. She screamed and
the man ran away. Policeman George
Riddell heard herecr?-~>i and ran to her
assistance, but the burglar had disap
peared in the darkness.
FOG CAUSED A FAILURE,
Return of the Astronomers of
the Lick Observatory*
Expedition.
Professor Schaeberle Explains Why He
Was Unable to Photograph
the Eclipse.
Professor J. M. Scbaeberle of the Lick
Observatory and his three companions â
C. Bnrchalter, Chabot Observatory, D<\
Shuey and Louis C. Masten â constituting
the LicK Observatory expedition to take
observations of tne sun's eclipse in Japan
on August 9, returned yesterday on the
steamer China.
The funds for the expedition were fur
nished by Colonel C. F. Crocter, and the
party left here with all the necessary
equipment to make thorough photo
graphic observations.
" I regret to say that the expedition was
an absolute failure," said the professor
when seen last night at the Lick House.
"We left here June 1 and reached Ak
keshi, on tbe island of Yezo, with our
forty-foot telescope and the smaller ones.
"We established four stations 150 miles
apart. At Akkeahi I remained with
Burchalter and Masten while Dr. Shuey
went to Monpetsu. Our native friend and
assistant, Ababiri, a graduate of the Im
perial University of Tokio, established
two other stations.
"The eclipse occurred at 3:20 o'clock in
tbe afternoon, at a time when it was
cloudy or foggy or raining at our respec
tive stations. Under the circumstances
we got absolutely no chance to do a single
thing but deplore our bad hick.
"We were not the only unfortunate
ones. The Amberst expedition, headed
by Dr. Todd, which left here on the yacht
Coronet last spring with enough instru
ments to overstock the country, left tbe
yacht *at Yokohama and made its way
to Isasbai, near Monpetsu, where all the
instruments were mounted. Well, the
same state of affairs occurred there that
occured where we were, and as a conse
quence the party is on its way home now
as crestfallen as we are ourselves."

another trance in an endeavor to discover
some new reason for holding out the war
rants of hard-working municipal em
ployes the appointing of the 3000 officials
who will be necessary to carry on the
coming election will be begun within the
week.
Mayor Sutro, who is supposedto repre
sent the Populists on the Election Board,
was not present yesterday when the
meeting was called, and it was decided
to canvass the names on the lists already
submitted by party organizations in
executive session this morning.

Superintendent of Streetsâ D. A. McDonald.
The Populists met in convention at
their tent last night to make nominations
for local officers. As a result the whole
body is now safely and lovinely in repose
in the welcoming arms of Christopher A.
Buckley. Big "Joe"' Dimo nd was nomi
nated for Mayor amid the most, intense
enthusiasm. After tne convention ad
journed the delegates aimply fell upon
one another's neck in the exuberance of
their joy at the way they had managed to
"elude" the bosses.
The convention was called to order by
Chairman Daywalt, and the following ad
ditional candidates were reported on
favorably by the investigating committee:
Justice of the Peace â J. C. Floyd and J.
W. Forman; City and County Attorney,
H. T. Creswell; Surveyor, Robert Munch;
School Directors â Dr. J. G. Crawford, J.
H. Wiley and William Cannon; Sheriff,
A. Decourtieux; Supervisors â Third Ward,
P. N. DeJany; Seventh Ward, Charles
Grambarth; bixth Ward, Fred W. Pot
ter.
Balloting was begun to select a Super
visor from the Eighth Ward. There were
two candidates, Dr. C. D. Cleveland and
F. M. Malloy. Cleveland received 49 vot-n
to his opponent's 45 and was declared the
nominee.
Dr. W. N. Griswold asked that "B. D."
or "R. D.," representing either a Buckley
or a Rainey Democrat, be placed after the
name of ail Democratic candidates. This
original suggestion aroused great excite
ment, but was not acted upon.
John M. Reynolds aroused the audience
to a high pitch of excitement by suddenly
rising and shouting that an attempt was
being made to "stuff the delegation be
hind him with persons not members of the
convention. The chairman instructed the
sergean t-at-arms to prevent this customary
political proceeding.
Supervisorial candidates from the Sev
enth Ward were Joseph Asbury Johnson
and James Ryan. Loud cheering fol
lowed the announcement that Johnson
had received 102 votes to Ryan's 1, and
was therefore the nominee.
There were four candidates from the
Sixth Wardâ Charles Schaffer, F. W. Pot
ter, W. Â£. Lane and Fred Eaton. After
the first ballot, which was not decisive,
Lane dropped out. Neither was the sec
ond ballot satisfactory, and Schaffer was
withdrawn. The fight then lay between
Potter, a Populist, and Eaton, reouted to
be a Buckley Democrat. Eaton received
45 votes and Potter 48. There were loud
cries of Eaton having been counted out,
and the roll was called. The vote was
found correct as stated, and Eaton was
the loser.
George Harry, chairman of the Thirty
first delegation, rose and yelled that
Buckley had packed the house. He
vociferously denounced these "aspira
tions" in their integrity. A riot was only
avoided by Daywalt's skillful handling of
the mallet.
Dr. J. S. Stone, having no opponent
from the Fifth Ward, was nominated by
acclamation. The same was true of C. W.
Pope, candidate from the Fourth Ward.
George D. Gillespie, candidate from the
Third, received 99 ballots to O. N. De
laney's 2. This called forth cheers.
Emile Kehrline was nominated from the
Second Ward by acclamation, and in the
first Henry Hnppert defeated Steven
Sangninetti by a vote of 85 to 15.
Adolph Sutro sent in his resignation as
nominee from the Twelfth, owing to ill
health. The resignation was accepted
and John M. Reynolds was elected over
T. G. Parker to fill the vacancy by a vote
of 70 to 28. Dr. Daywalt was strenuously
begged to accept the nomination by nearly
every delegate in the tent, but persisted in
a refusal.
Then came the event of the evening,
the naming of a nominee for Mayor. T.
V. Cator sent in a communication to the
effect that Dr. Jerome A. Anderson was
the most feasible candidate, but the chair
man ruled him out of the light as he had
not appeared before tbe investigating
committee.
The fight lay between Hon. J. Taylor
Rogers and Joseph I. Dimond, Buckley's
nominee. Both men were called to the
platform and shook hands, while the au
dience gave a deafening demonstration of
its approval.
Rogers, in an eloquent speech, stated
tbat there were moments in a man's life
when he must choose between self and
the best interests of his party and the gen
eral public
He believed this was one of them. He
further believed that there were more
feasible candidates than himself, men who
had shown by their records that they would
drag away the hand of the corporations
from the public throat, and therefore
begged to decline the nomination for
these reasons. Great applause followed.
There were then loud calls for a speech
from Dimond. He thanked the delega
tion for its expression of confidence,
pointed to his record as one of the "honest
four" as a guaranty of his future conduct,
stated that, though he was already the
nominee of a boss, he had made no prom
ise but to work for the public, and prom
ised to serve the people well if elected.
He also attested to his firm belief in the
major Popuhstic tenets.
Carleton H. Johnson nominated J. A.
Anthony.
As the delegation announced their votes
it was seen that Dimond received 74 votes
to Anthony's 28. Hats were thrown in
the air and for awhile all was pandemo
nium. Dimond, in. response to repeated
calls, thanked the convention for the
honor done him.
J. W. Reay withdrew in favor of D. A.
Macdonald for Superintendent of Streets,
and the latter's nomination was made by
acclamation.
Haskell said the Supreme Court had
ruled that there be no nominations for
five offices, but there was a likelihood of
this decision being reversed, and that
they had better have nominees ready.
Accordingly names of nominees wsre
suggested as follows: County clerk,
M. C. Haley and Joseph Reay;
District Attorney, Dan Sullivan; Sheriff,
Armond Decourtieux; Public Adminis
trator, Josepn Fassler; Recorder, Thomas
J. Glynn; Coroner, Dr. Adam. E. 8.
Barney was also named for Tax Collector.
There were two nominees on hand for
Tax Collector, James N. Block and God
frey Fisher. Owing to a misunderstand
ing about a resignation no ballot was had.
The convention then adjourned till 7:30
o'clock this evening.

Day Dreams of Love.
TT IS AGONIZING to think how many such . bright, happy
1 dreams are shattered ; how many love matches are broken off
or possible ones never realized how many marriages end in
separation or divorceâ love turned to hate, respect to contempt
;: All this because of men's disgraceful weakness, which unfits
them to become the mates of pure and healthful women.
To those who have thus fallen into the cesspool of disease ;
who are weighted down under a secret load of shame and misery
whose precious manly power is slipping away, from themâ to all
such persons Doctor Cook, the greatest of modern specialists,
extends a helping, skillful hand. His life work has been to lift
up the fallen, to restore them to sturdy manhood' and to the
proper enjoyment of either married or single life.

Webster, Madison Babccck and Charles
B. Stone were suggested, the balloting
resulting as follows: Webster 30, Babcock
12, Stone 2. Mr. Webster's nomination
was declared unanimous.
Barclay Henley introduced James D.
PheJan, the convention nominee lor
Mayor, Ktsa waÂ» received with cheers.
He said he had not prepared a speech,
but he would do his best to show bis
thanks to the convention for nominating
him.
Nominations for Supervisors were then
called for. Mr. Eilert moved that the rule
n quiring a two-thirds vote be dispensed
with. This caused some controversy.
Some >wanted to delay matters, and Eilert
said he would resign if the nominations
were put over.
.Matters speedily assumed a threatening
aspect, but at length, after much speech
making, it was decided to go into execu
tive session for the purpose of passing
upon the merits and demerits of the pro
posed nominees.
Just before the public and press repre
sentatives were excluded from the nail
Mr. Denicke presented the following list
of candidates for nomination to the oflice
of School Director:
Dr. H. L. Curtis (R.), Jeremiah Coffey (D.),
J. L. Halstead (R.), H.. C. Henderson (R.),
George A. Kohu (R.), George Lent (D.), C. H.
Madaox (D.), Elliott McAllister (D.), Andrew
Mi Klroy (R), William A. Plaoket (D.), W. A.
Powers (D.), Dr. J. H. Soper (R). Wallace Brad
ford (R.). Dr. W. D. Clark (R.), Dr. C. T. Deane
R.). <-â  K. Fredericks (R.). E. L. Head (R.), A.
H. Kay uÂ»n (R.), W. T. Kibbler (R.), John J.
McCarthy (R.l, F. L. Turpin (R.) and Georjje
Walcom (D.)
When, after nearly three hours of wait
ing, the doors were opened in attempt
was made to proceed to the nomination of
Supervisors.
Frank J. Sullivan moved that the list
be voted on as a whole. This called forth
a storm of opposition and the list was
taken up seriatim. The uproar was in
describable. Lawrence Dsvaney's friends
seemed at one time to have secured his
nomination, but the cry of "rushing
througn" was raised, and the convention
proceeded to review the other names.
Mr. Van Pelt was strenuously opposed
by supporters of Dr. Rettanzi, "while the
name oi I. J. Truman was shouted down
by friends of Dr. Clinton, v.ho seemed
very much in the majority.
No hope appearing that any practical
result could be gained, and it beine already
midnight, the convention adjourned
until this evening, the entire matter of
Supervisorial nominations being post
poned until then.)
NON-PARTISAN BOSSES.
Scheme to Secure Another Demo-
cratlc U. S. Senatorâ Repub
licans May Bolt.
There is lack of harmony in the Non-
Partisan Convention on the proposition to
nominate or indoe candidates for the
Senate and Assembly. It was understood
by many of the appointed delegates â
among those who had acted with the Re
publican party on Btate and National
questions â that the convention would
not go further than the nomination of a
municipal ticket.
The impression is very strong that
Frank Sullivan, who is J. D. Phelan's
brother-in-law, and Barclay Henley pulled
the Non- Partisan string in the beginning
to help Phelan. . Now there is a growing
suspicion that Democratic aspirants for
the United States Senate are seeking to
manipulate affairs so as to pievent the Re
publicans from gaining the Legislature.
The pretext advanced for interfering in
the contest for the Legislature is that
pledges to support the new charter are de
manded in the event of that instrument
going before the Legislature.
The constitution provides that a char
ter accepted by the voters of a city must
be ratified by the Legislature in order to
become a law. The Legislature cannot
amend it It must accept the charter as a
whole or reject it.
Republicans who were at first inclined
to Jena their support to the Non- Partisan
scheme, hoping that better municipal
government might be secured by such
Kupport, perceive now the cunning work
ol crafty Democratic politicians, and are
ready to swing back Into the regular Re
publican column.
The Non-Partiwns to-night may go
ahead with the legislative ticket, but the
scheme is so transparent that few Repub
uÂ«ans will be deceived.

SAYS HIS TOUCH
MAKES WHOLE
Arrival of August Schrader
Who Claims Power
Over Disease.
Is Arrayed in a Singular Garb
and Wears Long Hair
and Beard.
FASTS FORTY DAYS AT A TIME.
Was Born in Wisconsin, Is 26 Years
O.d and Has Treated Thou
sands Daily.
August Schrader, known as "the divine
healer," arrived here yesterday after a
tour in the East and South, during which,
as he claims, he cured many thousands of
people by the laying on of hands. In
Texas and New Mexico the raiiroads ran
special excursion trains, each arawn by
two locomotives, and thronged with people
to see Schrader.
He is a singular-looking man, with full
brown beard and long, dark brown hair.
His forehead is high, but he is uneducated.
He dresses in a long black gown, wears a
high white collar and from his breast
harms a silver cross with the figure of
Chrfst upor. it. Diagonally across his
breast is a band of black cloth with the
words "Schrader, the Divine Healer."
When he went on Market street yester
day after his arrival great crowds foHowed
him, and when he returned to the Inter
national Hotel, where he is staying, many
persons followed him there. Schrader,
with his long hair and beard and his com
manding stature, looks at rirst glance like
a man 40 years old.
His story is an odd one, with some of it
scarcely credible. Said he to a Call
representative:
"I was 25 years old in July last. 1 was j
born in Manito*voc County, Wisconsin, on |
the peninsula between Green Bay and
Lake Michigan. It is a rough, mountain
ous section. My parents are German and
came from Berlin. I never went to school
a day in my life; but, nevertheless, I
learned to read and write.
"I have a power given me of God to
cure all diseases, no matter if the ailment
is blindness or paralysis. I found I pos
sessed this power when I was 12 years
old, and 1 began at once to use it. This
caused unusual interest there. Then I
went out in the mountains, among the
fir and hemlock trees, and lasted forty
days and nights. This afterward brought
enormous crowds to see me. Since then
I have fasted evsry year for forty days
and nights, dome people think this can't
be done, but I do it.
"As many as 7000 people in a day have
been treated by me. I cure all who have
faith. I never charge for healing people,
but if any one wants to pay me a little
something for my expenses I do not refine
I oniy get enough to get something to
eat and clothe me. I haven't got enough
mnnev to Â«et my shoes shined. When I
SeataVmfny v 6000 or 6000 people in a
day I get weak, but the next day I am

strong again. I will stay here only as
long as I can do good."
MANHATTAN CLUB.
A FirÂ»t-ClagÃ Boxing and Wrestling En
tertainment on Mission Street.
The Manhattan Athletic Clttb, 1749
Mission street, gave an excellent boxing
and wrestling entertainment last evening
before a large gathering of members.
The programme was as follows: Wrestl
ing by Hoffman and Huderbrandt of the
San Francisco Tamers, Davis and Meagles
of the Columbia Athletic Club, Paul Den
hardt and Robert McCrossen of the Man
hattan Club.
The boxing was first-class, the wind-up
of the evening between F. Mailer of the
Manhattan Club and J. McQueeny of the
San Francisco Athletic Club being a most
exciting event. McQueeny had the better
of the first round, but in the subsequent
rounds Muller proved his superiority be
cause of his cleverness. Good hard
punching prevailed from start to finish.
It was a four-round "go."
A. Cohen and W. Brown. Wiggins
and Schoenfeld and Heeney and Riley
also gave a first-class fistic enter
tainment. George Ferris was master v
ceremonies, and William Daly as referee
gave general satisfaction in his decisions.
Zante Currants Again.
The famous Zante currant case which occu
pied the attention of the United States Circuit
Court for several weeks during the earlier part
of the year, is to be gone over again. 8. L.
Jones & Co.. the importers, who brought the
original action, are not satisfied with the deci
sion of Judge Morrow whereby they were com
pelled to pay a duty of one and a half cents per
pound on all Zante currants brought to this
country. Yesterday their attorney filed an
appeal in the United States Court of Apneals,
but it will probably not be reached for several
months to come. In the meantime an effort is
being made by New York parties to test the
law in that State. They believe that the Dis
trict Court there would hold differently from
Judge Morrow, and If a decision could be ob
tained taking off the objectionable duty, the
appeal filed yesterday would be withdrawu.
TRYING TO COVER
UP THE SCANDALS
The Board of Health Comes
in for Condemna
tion.
The Receiving Hospital Should
Be Open to Newspaper
PROTECTION TO EMPLOYES.
Mayor Sutro Siys That All Public
Institutions Sbou'd Be Wide
Open to Reporters.
The evident intention of the Board of
Health to prevent any scandal that may
hatch in the Receiving Hospital through
the treatment of patients or their belong
ings by employes from coming to light by
passing a rule preventing any one from
having access to the operating-room has
aroused widespread indignation.
In years gone by stories that have
shocked the community have found their
way to the surface through the hospital
being made a secret place screened from
the observation of the public, and those
who understand the manner in which
hospitals are conducted freely pre
dict that just such stories will ba afloat
again if the order of the board is carried
into effect.
The health authorities do not seem to
realize tuat the presence of outsiders, par
ticularly newspaper reporters, is a protec
tion to the employes. A case in point
was that of a young woman who was
brought in a few days ago suffering from
poison.
In order to discover her identity her
purse was opened in the presence of a
couple of reporters in the hope that some
of her cards might be in it. The coin
pocket was examined, and it was seen by
all that there was but 65 cents contained
there. After the patient had been taken
home her mother called at the hospital
and claimed that her daughter's purse
had contained several dollars in silver
when she was taken to the hospital.
It was not long ago that a great scandal
arose over the loss of the clothing and
other effects of a man who was first taken
to the Receiving Hospital and later, when
he died, to the Morgue. The officials of
each institution claimed that the others
were responsible for the loss. Further
back still, when the hospital was in the
old City Hall, the loss of a large sum of
money" that was known to have been on
the person of a patient when he was taken
in caused an investigation that threw
much odium on the hospital employes.
The general impression is that the Board
of Health has made a false move â one
arising more from ignorance than any
thing elseâ and one that can hardly fail to
breed scandals in the hospital.
"I am heartily in favor of allowing re
porters in all public institutions and giv
ing them every opportunity for the fullest
investigation of everything pertaining
thereto," said Mayor Sutro yesterday.
"Reporters are the eyes of the public,
and they see for the public There is no
public institution that is not better for
having its workings open to the newspa*
per men, and I am heartily in favor of let
liiig them see everything there is to see
and giving them all the information avail
able."
"There may be some things in a hos
pital particularly where women are taken
that it would be well to exclude from free
observation, but as a general proposition
public institutions should be wide open to
reporters.'^
BEHIND THE BARS.
Mrs. Hand Ballington Booth Speaks
of Her Prison Mission at Met
roplitan Temple.
Mrs. Maud Ballington Booth of the Vol
unteers of America made her second ap
pearance at Metropolitan Temple last
evening.
She immediately launched out upon her
particular mission â the needs of the
prisonersâ and spoke feelingly of how
much real beneficial work there was to be
done behind the gloomy bars.
"I have been saddened," said she, "to
see that which was wrecked, ruined and
tossed away. I remember once I walked
on the seashore where lay great numbers
of dead butterflies. The pretty painted
things bad winged their way from the
flowery shore far over the sun-tinted sea,
but the cruel waves caught them and they
were washed, drenched and broken up on
the beach.
" I have seen a beautiful shell shattered
and the fairest flower withered in its
beauty. So I have stood by the side of
the blighted lives with hope all gone and
the future all but dead. Then I have
looked up in the sky when hope was
deathless, where the future lay all in its
golden sunshine, and I felt that blighted
lives could be restored."
Mrs. Booth told how she bad studied
the prisoner problem long before she took
up the work. She did not study it from
penal literature or with lawyers, bnt on
her knees, and she found a way to effectu
ally reach the better nature of the con
vict.
Large Bunches of Grapes.
A fine lot ot grapes and pears for exhibition
purposes has been received at the State Board
of Trade rooms, 16 Post streets, from New

the country making collections of late fruits
and grapes to replenish the stock here. Sev

rifers to low pressure, and is usually preceded

NEW YORK MARKETS.
Financial.
NEW YORK, N. V., Sept. 30. -Speculation at
the r-tock Exchange was characterized by firm
ness to-day. Higher.cables from London assisted
the upward movement at the start, especially as
the torei ners were buyers of St. Paul, Louisville
and Nashvltie ui-d some of . the low-priced issues.
The early rise was equal to %@2 per cent: sugar,
Atcbison, leather preferred. Pullman Palace. Man
hattan and the grangers leading. -The advance
brought out considerable long stock, one house
being credited . with > sales of 20,000 share* of
various stocks. While the bulk os the seiilu . was
considered to be for the purpose of turning paper
profit into cash, there was some disposition to
maKe ventures on tne short side because of the
firmness of sterling exchange and the be ief the
Importation of gold had ceased at least fur a time.
The weakness of sugar and tobacco * was ' not
thought to be due to the powerml influence of
tome speculators. Sugar was the most active
stock ou the list. It opened Â»4 per cent higher, at
112%. Lone and short btock was promptly sup
pllea, however, ana under these offerings there
was a decline to 110%@iliy8 It is asserted in
usually well-informea quartets that the company
has ured the Camden refinery and wilt â  pay for
It in cash. J obacco was another weak stock and
fell from 61% to 60% on he mrther reduction in
the price ot' Battle ..x plus. The directors met
to-day and declared a dividend of 2 per cent on
the. preferred and 3 percent on scrip. The divi
dend on the common was passed.
In the late am-rnc on trading the marxet felt the
effeuof steady liquidations and' prices showed a
tendency to sag. The reaction from the top of the
day was equal 10 ViÂ® 1 4 per cent In the . general
list and nearly 2 per cent in sugar. The ' market

MEETING TO BE CALLED.
Social .Rivalry, Politics and a Legis
lative Ambition Figure in
the Struggle.
Oaklakd Office Bus Frakcisco Call,)
90S Broadway, Sept. 30. I
Thomas Pearson, the leading factor in
the organization of the Colored Folks'
Home at Beulab, has bean removed from
his position as landscape gardener in
Lafayette Park, and William Delaney,
another colored man, has been appointed.
Serious trouble has resulted, the more
serious, inasmuch as the ladies have de
clared their determination to stand by
Pearson in the hour of his distress.
The cbinge in the gardenersbip of a pub
lic square, although it precipitated the
present unrest in the race, is the smallest
element to be considered. It ha 1 * troubled
colored society'.s center, has Deen
clothed with political importance and a
large section of the colored people in San
Francisco jis also interested in the matter.
For a long time there I aye been two
wings of local colored society. Pearson
and the Colored Folks' Home ladies have
represented one side and Mr. Wilson,
editor of Ihe c Elevator, and Delaney have
captained the other wing.
A short time ago a petition was pre
sented to the Board of Public Works by
the friends of Mr. Delaney. stating that
Mr. Pearson was not a representative
man ol the race, and askinc that Mr.
Delan y be appointed keeper of the cacti
of Lafayette Park. That petition is at
the root'of ail the trouble. The salary of
the job is altogether insizniflcaut com
pared to the honor of beinp "the repre
sentative man of the race." Whether the
petition haÃ any weight or not does not
appear on the minute-book of the board,
but the appointment of Delany, vice Pear
son, retired, does appear.
Pearson recently filed his petition with
the County Clerk, and will be placed on the
State tirket as an independent candidate
â for the Assembly. This piece of ambition
â  on his part is said by his friends to have
caused His downfall. Anyhow, a huge
petition is now being circulated by his
friends, and the signatures to it are al
ready over seven feet long, and Pearson
declares tbat it will be long enough to
stretch from the board room to the part.
Mrs. Cy Jackson is determined that Mr.
Pearson shall be vindicated by the Ladies'
Auxiliary of the Colored FolKs' Home As
sociation, of whicb she is a member.
The ladies will hold a parlor meeting
shortly and decide upon a plan to help
Pearson. Meantime, Delaney is training
the cacti, naowinp the grass and drawing
the warrant as gardener of Lafr.yette Park.

VALUE OF LICENSING.
The Merchants' Exchange Finds
Its Weapon Used Against
Itself.
Coal-Dealers Want the Privilege of
Selling Coal lo the Employes of
ihe Southern Pacific
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, i
908 Broadway, Sept. 30. f
Frank R. Girard, an ex -director of the
Merchants' Exchange ana one of the most
active merchants of this city, caused a
surprise to that body at last night's meet
ing by sending- the following resignation:
To the Merchants' Exchange : I hereby tender
my resignation as a member of the exchange
lor fhe reason that my business is more in
jured than benefited by your constant agita
tion of licenses; my renting bu&iness iv Berke
ley, formerly good, being fuily as good tDero
as in Oakland. I am told by a merchant of
Berkeley that they have followed the lead of
Oakland in raising the license, and, as I can
not afford to pay $100 for my team, 1 will have
to discontinue my business there. Very re
spectfully yours, F. R. Girard.
One of the chief reasons for the organi
zation oi the exchange was to secure the
passage of a license ordinance that would
Keep outside merchants from coming into
Oakland and doing business. After sev
eral arrests bad been made the San Fran
cisco firms opened branch stores in this
city and thus avoided the high license.
The next trouble came when some Oak
land hack-drivers were arrested in Ala
meda for not having a liceuse to do busi
ness in that city. The Alameda ordi
nance requires all expressmen and car-
riage-owners to take out a license if they
enter that city.
The latest difficulty comes .from Berke
ley. The Town Trustees passed a license
ordinance to-night that provides for a
license of $100 per quarter on all parties
doing busir.ess in BerKeley who have not
a nxed place oi business in that city. At
the meeting oi the Oakland Merchants'
Exchange last night this matter was dis
cussed, but as the local merchants have
btren anxious to secure the same protec
tion that Berkeley now seeks, no com
plaint was made.
Another very interesting subject was
brought up. L. N. Hager of tue Coal
dealers' Association asked that the ex
change co-operate with the coal-dealers in
trying to induce the Southern Pacific
Company to cease selling coal to its em
ployes.
An employe of the company stated to
day that the Southern Pacific had made a
practice for years of selling their em
ployes sufficient coal for their personal
use at cost oricr, It is this practice that
the association is anxious to stop.

OAKLAND, Cal.. Sept. 3oâ Mrs. Keene,
better known as Miss Lottie Johnson, has
through her attorney, T. F. Garrity, filed
a demand on her hnsuand for money for

years ago the servant of E. R. Keene, a
Valencia-street druggist. Keene betrayed

owini: to tue work of a charitable society
he was required to marry her. A few
weeks after the marriage a child was born
which soon died. Before its birrh Keene
deserted his wife and she was taken to the
City and County Hospital. Mrs. Keene

MIDWEEK THEATER NOTES
Continued Success ot the Royal
Hawaiian Band at the
Orpheum
Music-Lovers F ock to Ebar the Sink
ing of tho Hiwaiian Glee
Cub.
A laree number of music lovers are
being attracted to the Orpheum this week
by the music of the Hawaiian National
band. Under the leadership of Professor
J. S. Libornio this excellent band of mu
sicians gives a change of programme at
each performance, end the varied music
contains numbers which are calculated to
appeal to all classes of music lovers.
Last night one of the features of the
performance was a brilliantly rendered
fantasia on Gounod's "Faust."
The Royal Hawaiian Glee Club, how
ever, eclipses in populajity the perform
ances of the band. Every one knows mat
there is a natural charm and sweetness
about the singing of natives of Hawaii,
and the vocuiists of the band sing tneir
duets, quartets, quintets and choruses in a
way which is well calculated to sustain
the national reputation. Tne glee club
has to respond every night to a number of
encores.
The Carpo Brothers, a team of remark
ably skilllul Hcrobats, are the star feature
of the vaudeville bill this week. Master
Walter Leon, the child actor and mimic,
is as popular as ever, Riley and Huges are
amusing plantation dancers and come
dians, and clever little Marguerite Fergu
son is still on the bill.
Lew Hawkes, the cork-blacked singing
and talking comedian, amuses the audi
ence in his own clever and humorous way.
He has come back with a number of new
jokes, which are thoroughly appreciated
by the audience.
Anna Suits, the comedienne and vocal
ist, is a San Francisco girl who has come
back from an Eastern tour, and wnose
many friends in this City have not for
gotten her.
The bill is comDleted by Ferguson and
Mack, the kuockabout comedians, who
make plenty of hilarity.
There will be only a few more per
formances of "Lost Paradise" at the Co
lumbia Theater by the Frawley Company.
On Monday next "Trilby" will be pre
sented by the company that includes
Edith Crane, Jennie Reiffarth, Charles
Kent, Herbert Carr and E. W. Morrison.
A good even performance of "School"
Is being given at the Alcazar this week.
One of the prettiest bits of lovemaking
seen on the local stave for some time is
that between John T. Sullivan as Lord
Beaufoy and May Buckley as Bella.
"Shadows of a Great City" is rilling the
Grand at every performance. The melo
drama is a stirring one and is well acted.
"Aida" will run to the end of the week
at the Tivoli Opera-house, after which the
grand opera season will come to an end.
On Monday "Satanella " will be revived.
The reopening of the Baldwin Theater
will be inaugurated next Monday night
with the presentation of Daniel Frohman's
New York success, "The Prisoner of
Zenda."
A North Sea codfisher carries a set of
lines 7200 fathoms in ienrth, and having

QUILL'S DAMAGE SUIT
Testimony in Behalf or the Plaintiff
Has All Been lutro
duoed.
The testimony for the plaintiff in the
damage suit filed against the Southern
Pacific Company by the father of Amy
Quill, the little girl who was killed by a
Berkeley train, was concluded yesterday.
So far nine witnesses have been examined.
It was expected that some sensational
evidence would be given, inasmuch as it
was claimed that bribery and other
methods of influencing witnesses had been
resorted to by tne defense. Tne sensation,
however, has so far failed to materialize.
Some of the witnesses for the railroad
will be heard to-day, and as there are
fifteen of them, it will probably take all
week to finish the case.
GENERAL MILES' ESCAPE.
Ilii Close ( all From a Serious Acci-
cleut on the Clift" House. Road.
Comine in from the Cliff House yester
day afternoon Major-General Miles and
wife and Colonel A. S. Kimball and wife
narrowly escaped a serious accident. They
were in an open carriane drawn by two
horses, coming down the hill toward the
Park and Ocean Railroad, when one of the
horses began rearing and kicking. The
carriage pole was broken and the driver
was thrown from his place and run over.
The horses started to run, but no one
jumped from tne carriage. The team was
checked by men in the vicinity before the
horses had iun fifty yards. The broken
carriage was left at the vcene of the mis
hap and the party boarded the cars for the
Palace Hotel. The driver was eomowhat
bruised, but not dangerously hurt.
The team belongs to the United Carriage
Company, and the pole had recently been
strengthened writh a view to averting ac
cidents of this character. The good be
havior of one of the horses probably
averted a serious runaway.
General Miles and party left the City on
the evening train for Los Angeles.

Urgent Need of a He ping Hand Being
Extended to Waifs Who Find
Their Way to Prison.
Oakland Office San Francisco Ca.llJ
908 Broadway, Sept. 30. J
Little Gus From, 10 years of age, was the
center of n scene in the Police Court this
morning that caused the lobby to wonder
and murmur. It made very plain the
need of a place for young children charged
with crime, such as Chief Lloyd referred
to in his recent address to the City Chris
tian Endeavor Union.
The lad was arrested at the instigation
of his mother, who says he is incorrigible
and a young thief. Whatever may be the
boy's faults, it was very apparent that he
has a good side to his nature, and that he
is not so far depraved as to be incapable
of reform.
He was brought into court from the cell
in which he was placed late Monday night,
when he was arrested, and when he saw
his mother sitting in the courtroom he
rusheu up to her, and, with tears and sobs,
begged her to take him home and he
would do better.
"Oh, mamma," the child cried, "take
me home again and I will be a good boy."
"You'll have to keep still, said Bailiff
Mitchell, "or I will take you downstairs."
At the mention of downstairs the child
shuddered and said, between his sobs,
"Oh, mister, I will be good li you won't
take me down."
The mother had not sworn to a com
plaint so the case went over till to-mor
row. Officer Curtias had great difficulty
in taking the child away from his mother,
and when at the door leading downstairs
the voice of the unhappy child could be
heard in the courtroom as he cried,
"Please let me go and kiss my mother
good-by," but his request was not granted
and he went downstairs.
There is nothing but a cell in the City
Prison for children, no matter why they
are arrested, and even a lost child mast be
placed in a cell till called for, unless some
one can be found to take him or her to a
home. No provision exists for jÂ»irls who
may not have taken the first downward
step but who may be arrested for vagrancy
because of their companions. To all such
cases Oakland offers a criminal's cell, and
Chief Lloyd's humanity is touched that it
should be ho.
"Little From, I am told, is quite a bad
boy," said Chief Loyd this afternoon;
"but still tne prison is no place for him.
I had him put in the most comfortable
cell, which is all that could be done. Had
he been taken in hand the first time he
was in trouble he might never have done
wrong ascain. When a child realizes that
he is locked up in a common prisoner's
cell the first step toward helping to make
him a criminal has been taken.
DIRT CHEAP DELEGATES.
Disreputable Methods of Kelly
and Mahoney at Their
" Convention."
Strangers Readily Admitted to Vote.
Two-Dollar Men Protest Against
Non-Payment.
Should any doubt remain as to the
fraudulent and illegitimate nature of the
so-called Kelly-Mahoney "convention," it
will be set at rest by the revelations that
are coming to light. Volunteers are com
ing forward with startling stories of
brazen methoJs openly used by the Siam
ese twin bosses of shameless effrontery.
It is oppnly admitted that "delegates"
were paid $2 a night each to sit in the
"convention." Pay was good the first
night, but on the second grass was short
and there was growling among "the
push." In fact, there was a movement to
strike and bolt unless the promised pay
ment was made sood, but the bosses exe
cuted a masterly flank movement with
steam-beer. Malcontent ringleaders were
beguiled from the hall and mellowed with
amber schooners, and peace was thus
cheaply secured.
An outsider was asked to get a nomina
tion by this "convention" for a friend.
The man applie I to objected on the score
of not being a delegate nor possessing a
proxy. Nevertheless he consented to in
vestigate the possibility.
On arriving at the Auditorium the
stranger was hospitably received by a
buss, and on explaining his purpose was
welcomed as if it were of ordinary occur
rence.
"But," said the gentleman, "I am not a
delegate and have no proxy !"
"Never mind," said the boss, "go and sit
over in my district delegation!"
The gentleman went over somewhat
timidly, but was reassured by his recep
tion. While there he was paralyzed by
the shameless manner in which "delega
tions," represented by six members, were
voted "all present."
When nominations for his friend's posi
tion were called lor, the pseudo-delegate of
the Forty-fourth mounted the stage and,
placinc his friend in nomination, chuckled
to see him nominated by acclamation.
"Any respectable-looking man, delegate
or not, can nominate a roan here," he was
confidently informed by another "dele
gate."

In the Forty- First.
The Forty-first Assembly District Re
publican Club held an enthusiastic ratifi
cation meeting last night at Fizley Hall,
corner of Pacific avenue and Polk street.
Resolutions were adopted indorsing the
ticket nominated by the Regular Repub
lican Convention, which was sustained
yesterday by the State Central Committee.
The club specially indorsed the candi
dates from the Forty-first District, nam
ing Charles S. Tilton for Surveyor, Carroll
Cook for Superior Judge, Henry A. Stef
fens for Supervisor, and Henry C. Dibble
for the Assembly. Stirring speeches were
made by Colonel C. L. Taylor, Republican
candidate for Mayor; by Carroll Cook,
Henry C. Dibble, Frank H. Powers, Henry
C. Jb'irebaugh and others.
All for Protection.
George W. Sill, an energetic Teal estate
man of Watson ville, is -in the City. The
farmers around Watsonville grow sugar
beets, and Mr. Sill reports that they are to
a man in favor of the party and candidate
tbat promise them protection.
WORK FOR PRINTERS.
W. A. Woodward & Co. Will Yet Get
Oat the Register of Voters.
According to Thomas P. Woodward,
who constitutes the printing firm of W. A.
Woodward & Co. of 12 Sutter street, a
gigantic combination of printers, paper
dealers and type-founders has been en
deavoring ever since last Friday, when he
was awarded the contract for printing the
great register, to ruin him by preventing
him from carrying out his contract.
"I was told before I submitted a bid that
I was to be dove up," said Mr. Wood
ward, "but after figuring the matter out I
concluded tbat I could not only get the
register out on time and according to con
tract, but also make a good profit out of
the job, and so bid as I did.
"The only thing I have not arranged for
in the way of materials is ink, and I know
where there are hundreds of pounds to be
had for the asking and a check. Labor
will not bother me for mine is a union
house and 250 union men have already ap
plied for work for the $5 per day that each
man will be allowed, and I think we will
have all we want."
His Neck Was Broken.
Charles Lallemont, 76 years of age, and for
some months past an inmate of the Alms
house, met with a fatal accident yesterday
morning. Just how the accident occurred no
one seems to know, for Lallemont was found
lying dead in a kind of dry well between the
two main houses. It is presumed, however,
that while walking aloDg the porch he became
dizzy and fell over the railing to the ground
below, a distance ol twelve feet. The man
evidently fell on his head, as his neck was
broken.

VIRGINIA FAIR'S
AGE IN QUESTION
Matter of a Few Months
Occasions an Hour's
Argument.
The Ladies Listen and Yawn,
and Are Altogether
Disgusted.
THEY WANT TO GO EAST.
May Be Djtained, However, Un
After Giving Their Testimony
in the Will Contest.
%
All of yesterday was consumed by the
lawyers in tbe Fair-Craven ejectment suit
in a wrangle over certain technicalities
concerning the deposition of Miss Virginia
Fair taken the day before, but which was
being read for her approval and signing.
During the taking of the deposition Mr.
Lloyd had remarked that Miss Fair was
not of age at the beginning of the pro
ceedingÃ, and so could not be expected to
know about those certain details as to
which she was questioned.
Mr. Brittain asked her how old she was j
and she answered 21 years last Mar.en.
The date of the riling of the ejectment
suit and Mr. Lloyd's statement did not
agree with Miss Fair's deposition, and Mr. j
Lloyd declared that he did not refer to the
ejectment suit, out to the beginning of the
Fair will litigation, and so a long discus
sion and wrangle ensued over Mr. Lloyd's
insistence upon being properly repre
sented in the record.
As the reading droned along other tech
nical exceptions were taken to the record
which precipitated other arguments ana
threatened to carry the whole matter into
court for adjustment.
However, after the waste of much time I
in argument, the differences were in every |
case adjusted by withdrawals and conces
sions by the lawyers themselves.
Meantime the two young ladies sat
through the hours listening to the mono
tone of Notary Phillips or the learned dis
cussion of the" lawyers over the meaning of
a word or the turning of a phrase, wearied
alike with the one or the other, declaring |
that it was the most meaningless and tire- 1
some performance they had attended for !
many, many days.
Miss Fair sat for the most part looking
out of the window, inspecting the chim
ney-pots on the neighbor:-' buildings and I
paying little attention to what was going
onl When the reading was concluded she
signed the document and seemed much j
relieved.
Mr. Lloyd announced that they intended
to go East at once. However, it is under
stood from other sources that they will not
leave until some time next week, and per
haps not until they have given their testi
mony in the pencil will contest, which is
set for trial on the 6th of October.
DAIRYMEN IN SESSION,
Major Alvord Says Tuberculosis
Is Not So Dangerous
After All.
Interesting Papers Read and Dis
cussed by the Members
Present
Tuberculosis was the principal subject of J
discussion at the dairymen's convention i
yesterday. It was argued upon from every â 
standpoint, and the result of it all was a \
decision that the bacilli thought to be
bo deadly is not so dangerous after all.
In the morning .Professor C. W. Wood
worth of the State University read a paper
on "Important Points in State Inspec
tion." A short discussion followed, alter
which the all-absorbing question of tuber
culosis was taken up.
Mrs. E. W. Steele of San Luis Obispo
read a paper on tne subject. The gist ot
her suggestions was to the effect that the
best way to counteract the spread of tu
berculosis was to take proper care of the j
cattle. "See that they are properly
housed," she said, "and kept warm and j
dry, besides being well fed, and you will :
have little fear."
Dr. R. Â±1. Freund of the San Francisco
Microscopical Society followed with a
paper in which he said that microscopical
examination of the tuberculosis bicilliwas
very unreliable and could not b'3 safely
depended upon in examining railic.
The Babcock test in the hands of a prac- \
tical and experienced man is the only sure
tMt by which milk could be tested, he said.
Major Alvord, on being introduced by
tie president, explained the position he
occupied in the department of United
States Bureau of Animal Industry. He j
said be was sent by the secretary of his
department to the Pacific Coast to collect
information. Reading from the recent
ordinance passed by the Supervisors at the
request of the Board of Health he favored
that portion which provided for the in- j
spections of the dairies, but he did not j
approve of that portion which prohibited
the sale of skim milk.
He 'concurred with Dr. Freund in his
opinion of the Babcock test. Branching
into the subject of tuberculosis, Major
Alvord spoke on it for over one hour,
showing the signs of the disease in the
animals when they become badly affected, i
He wound up with the cheerful assurance
that there was considerably less danger
from the use of the milk or the meat of |
animals partly affected than the general 1
public had any idea of.
Resolutions were passed in memory of
B. W. Green, late treasurer of the a-sooa- j
tion; aiso one recommending the Nica
ragua canal to the favorable consideration
of Congress.
Chinese Boycott Doomed,
It is rumored that an edict has teen prom
ulgated in Chinatown to the effect that the
See Yups and fcam Yups, at present separated
by a boycott, must bury the hatchet. The pen
alty rs said to be the forwarding of name 3of
recalcitrants to the Chinese Emperor in Pe
king. _______________

ACUTE UP-TC-DATE POSTUKIKG.
The Posters Inciud* "A Bicycle
Girl," " m he Horse Show " and
"Chimmie Fadden."
Â° A living poster exhibition, with society
people to pose, will be given to-morrow
evening at the Association Auditorium
for the benefit of the Society for Christian
Work.
'Living posters" is the latest develop
ment of the tableaux-vivants fad. In tbe
East it has been the fashion for some
The "Nameless" Girl Under the Umbrella, Miss Wade as the Bicycle Girl and T. CSullivan and
Miss Ethel Cohen, at the Horse Show.
months to entertain audiences with living
representations of Beardsley's Titian
headed ladies and Gibson's beauteous
maidens, but the idea is a brand-new one
to San Francisco, and it isexpected that
society will turn out in force to welcome
it. The ladies having the affair in charge
are the entertainment committee of the
Society for Christian Work of the First
Unitarian Church, of which Mrs. George
Gibbons is president. The following
ladies have been working hard for some
time to make the "posters" a puncess: Miss
Anna Beaver, the Misses Withrow, Mrs.
W. F. Sumner, Miss Wade, Miss Snook,
Miss F. Lund burg and Mrs. Paul T. Good
loe.
When it was first proposed to give a
poster exhibition the ladies managed to
collect some masterpieces of modern art
as it exists on posters. But there was a
difficulty in the way of putting them into
the flesn. The maidens of Bcatdsley and
his imitators were so tearfully and won
derfully made that no California girl
could be found capable of reproducing
their nightmares. Can ary- colored locks,
or even scarlet nuir. was possible, with tbe
aid of the wigmaker, but a lady with an
arm twenty-rive points of the compass
out of its natural course and an attitude
that could only be achieved by a contor
tionist was something wtiich no Cali
fornia girl could possibly reproduce, so
tbe nightmares were laid on one side and
posters having a closer resemblance to
human beings were substituted in their
places.
The posters selected are those issued by
Harper's, Scribner's and Lippincott's, to
advertise either magazines or books. They
are to be shown in a broad, white frame
to imitate a margin, and the backgrounds
are painted in pastel. With a strong
electric light, comjne from the interior of
the frame, the pictures have a striking
likeness to real posters. There will be
twelve of teem.
"The Grasshoppers" is a poster issued
for a new novel by Mrs. Andrew Dean. It
represents a shivering little maiden in a
snowstorm, with her mandolin hanging
useless by her side. The idea is based on
JEsop's iable of the improvident little
grasshopper who sang all summer and
asked the industrious ant in vain for food
when the snow came. This part is to be
taken by Miss Sophie Brannen.
"February" is one of Harper's posters.
It represents a youth tendering a beauti
ful valentine to a maiden. George Cam
eron will pose as the youth and Miss Helen
Wagner will be the recipient of the valen
tine. "March" is anotner Harper poster.
It shows a girl with her hair tumbled by
the wind and a white March hare standing
on its hind feet beside her. "March" will
be impersoTsateo by Miss Gertrude Church.
"A Lady of Quality" is Scribner's poster

The poster which helped to spread
abroad the fame of "Chimmie Fadden"
shows a gentleman and a lady with their
noses buried in the book. Miss Isabel
Preston and George Dennison will pose as
the students of 'Chimmie." "July shows
a young lady on a canary-colored beach,
with a purple sea in the background. The
girl is shading her face from the rays of
the sun under a huge parasol, and as her
features are not exhibited her friends say
it would not be fair to tell her name.
"Football" is a poster which will be posed
for by Ray Sherman and Marguerite

In addition to the living posters there
will be a musical programme at to

NEILSON WANTED.
His Sister-in Law Swore Oat a Warrant
Accusing Him of
Bobbery.
A warrant has been issued by Police
Judge Conlan for the arrest of William M.
Neilson on a charge of robbery. The com
plainant is Miss C. A. McFarland. a sister
of Mrs. William M. Neilson. The warrant
has been out since la^t Monday, but up to
last night Neilson had succeeded in evad
ing arrest and he was supposed to be in
hiding in or oat of San Francisco.
The story of the alleged robbery was
told by Miss McFarland last evening in
her home at the corner of Capp and
Twenty-third streets. Miss McFarland in
the owner of some ranch property in Napa
County and is also the reputed owner of
the house at Twenty-third and Capp
streets.
"I was coming home last Saturday after
noon," said Miss McFarland, "and found
Mr. Jifeilson in this neighborhood. A lady
entered this house, and he forced bis way
in also. I had just come from my attor
ney's and had my satchel with some pa
pers in it. Mr. Neilson said that he was
going to searcb my person, and took hold
of the satchel and tore it open and took
out the papers which were in it.
"I had two leases in my hand to my
ranch in JJapa County. Mr. Neilson tried
to get these away from me. I held on and
would not let co. He struggled and man
aged to get my thumb in his mouth and
bit through to tbe bone. I did not want
to lose my thumb and so I let go of the
leases and be took them and went away.
"The complaint for robbery is based
upon the taking away of valuable papers
from me at the time and place I have men
tioned."

AT HOME AT LAST.
The Children's Hospital Opens Its
Doors to Receive S ck and Des
titute Young Fernandez.
Francisco Fernandez, the boy whom
Officer Hooper found eating garbage from
a waste barrel a week or so ago, has been
a source of much thought to the officers
of the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children, who have tried hard
to find a place for him. When found the
youngster was suffering from a severe and
loathsome form of eczema. He was taken
to the County Hospital, where the disease
was gotten partially under control.
However, the County Hospital has no
children's ward, and yesterday the society
was notified that young Fernandez would
have to be taken elsewhere. Officer Mc-
Murray took the lad, so to speaÃ, from
Herod to Pilate before he couid find a
place for him. The Youths' Directory
and Boys and Girls' Aid Society officers
did not dare to receive the youngster,
through fear that he might infect their
wards, as he has infected other children
with whom he has been placed. At last
temporary accommodation for him was
found at the Children's Hospital, where
he is at present.
RABBI FRYER RESIGNS.
Incompatibility of Views the Cause.
Goea to Cleveland.
Rabbi Julius Fryer surprised the Con
gregation Obabai shalome yesterday by
announcing at service that his resignation
had been handed in a few days previously,
and that Monday next he would leave for
his old home in Cleveland, Ohio, for rest,
prior to accepting a pastorate in tne East
recently tendered him.
The cause of this was that he was of the
reform school and failed to overcome the
conservatism of the older members of the
church, largely in the majority.
His pastorate has lasted only a year,
but in that time he has done much in the
cause of education in local Jewish circles.
He has started here a branch of the
National Cnautauqua Society, which is in
a flourishing condition, and has organized
a branch of the Ladies' Council, with a
membership bordering on 250.
The best of feeling exists between him
and liia congregation, and he has an
nounced his intention of endeavoring to
procure for them a leader whose ideas are
more in harmony wkh their doctrines
than his own.

WORE HIS WIFE'S DRESS
How Prosper Vincke's Spree
Resulted in His Being
Arrested.
Mrs Vincke Wanted to Keep Him at
Home and Locked Up His
Clotbes.
Prosper Vincke, a peddler living on
Louisa street, met with a startling ex
perience yesterday, one that has made him
a sadder and a wiser man.
Vincke occasionally indulges in the use
of spirituous liquors to a greater extent
than meets with the approbation of his
wile. On Monday ho had a gilt-edged
jag on, and yesterday he woke with a
raging thirst. Mrs. Yincke suggested that
his wisest course would be to remain in
bed and peacefully sleep off the effects of
his potations. Vincke scorned this coun
sel and toM his better bait that far from
remaining in the peaceful seclusion of his
home he was going a tour of the saloons
in the neighborhood in order to sample
more spirituous liquors and get a little
more gilt on his jag. In vain did his wife
plead and beg of him to remain where he
was. Prospers spirit was up, and his
thirst grew as he stayed to bandy words
with Mrs. Vincke.
Finding all her eloquence of no avail
the wife had recourse to strategem. She
sequesterated all Prospers wearing ap
parel, and, placing it under lock and key,
i went about her household duties with the
happy belief that Prosper would not go
out in the street in his pajamas, and that
for once he was outwitted.
But the peddler was not so easily van
quished. He had said he was going a tour
of the saloons in the neighborhood, and
he resolved to go, cost what it micht. His
wife's best garments were hanging in their
wonted place in the cupooard upstairs,
and, taking advantage of a few minutes
when Mrs. Vincke was busy in the kitchen,
Prosper donned them hastily and stole
quietly toward the front door. He did
not delay a moment for a sidelong glance
in the. glass to see if bis bonnet was on
straight; neither did he pause to arrange
his neckruff. He just opened the door
quietly and fled up the street towards the
nearest saloon.
But a* ill luck would have it as Prosper
Vincke fiVd up the street an acquaintance
of his. Officer Esckew, happened to be
descending it and the two men met face to
face. Esckew was astonished beyond
measure to see Prosper Vincke with his
wife's best bonnet ruthlessly jammed on
bis bead and her best gown trailing in the
dust, but he had no difficulty in recogniz
ing him through his flimsy disguise, and
being a faithful guardian of tne peace he
at once arrested him for masquerading in
woman's clothes. In vain did Prosper
plead that bis wife had driven him to it.
The officer, turning a deaf ear to his en
treaties, walked him off to jail, where he
is still repenting of having started for a
saloon In his wife's best clothes.
GAMES OF SUFFRAGISTS
Forthcoming Dramatic and Musi
cal Entertainment at the
Tivoli.
Miss Anthony Addresses a Select Par
lor Meeting at Mrs. Wellmao's
in Fruitvale.
At an early date the woman suffragists
propose to give a grand dramatic enter
tainment at the Tivoli. Mrs. Ernestine
Kreling has kindly donated the use of the
opera-house free of all expense, and tbe
various theatrical companies in town, be
side several fine specialty artists, have
engaged to take part in the programme.
Tbe 22d inst. is mentioned as the prob
able date of the affair.
Arrangements for the young ladies' con
cert on the evening of the 6th inst., at
Metropolitan Temple, have been Com
pleted. Tbe sale of tickets has been
phenomenally large, and the concert
promises to prove a brilliant success.
A number of prominent society people
of this City accompanied Miss Anthony
to Mrs. Weiiman's parlor meeting at
Fruitvale. Miss Anthony made a little
informal address, which was cordially
applauded, but the "question box" was
the feature oi the intellectual feast, the
agod suffrage worker's witty answers call
ing forth peals of laughter, while they
conveyed some solid truths which seemed
to impress the visitors most forcibly.
Mrs. Laura Riddell writes from Vaca
ville that at a recent meeting in the pa
vilion the entire audience, consisting of
over 1500 persons, rose en masse when an
expression in favor of the woman suffrage
movement was called for, a number of
prominent men of tbe town making ex
temporaneous remarks on the lines sug
gested by tne address of the evening.

was tbe principal speaker, and he de
nounced the proposed charter as being
dangerous, as it wi 11 take away the rights
of the people. He said that it was framed
in the interests of the corporations, and
that when it was formed the laboring ele
ment was not invited to debate or discuss
tbe several points. Therefore labor is in
no way represented in the document.
Martin, Theodore Lynch, \V. Baruth and
Leo Gasser also spoke in a similar vein.
F. W. Dobrmann. president of the Mer
chants' Association, asked if he would be
permitted to correct a few statements on
facts that had been made by the speakers.
He was denied the privilege by Martin.
Another man sai'i that he was a socialist,
but did not indorse tbe arguments made
against the charter. He, too, was denied
a hearing. Finally Chairman Martin said
to Mr. Dohrmann that the alliance would
find a man who would meet him in debate,
a challenge that Mr. Dohrmann promptly
accepted.
Dr. Willey offered a resolution severely
denouncing the charter, to which Mr.
Dobrmann objected, stating that it was
not fair to denounce that which had not
been debated. He wanted to present his
side of the matter to the audience before
condemnatory resolutions were pasAed.
Chairman Martin, however, looked on the
subject in a different light and the reso
lutions were adopt d.
A Suggestion.
"You have a very complete establish
