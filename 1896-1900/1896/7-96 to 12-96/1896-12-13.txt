Slain by Cowards.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla.. Dec. 12.â J. A.
Hana, the agent of the Cuban Junta here,
has received a letter which confirms the
"- report of the death of Antonio Maceo,
-. but also indicates that the Cuban leader
was the victim â¢of a treacherous plot
formed by his own, physician, Dr. Zer
â¢â¢-' tucha, and the Marquis Ahumada, who
acts as Captain-General of Havana when
Weyler is absent in the field. The letter,
'".'. which was written by a prominent citizen
â  "â¢; of Havana, whose name is withheld in
order that be may not fall under the dis
pleasure of the ' Spanish authorities, is as
follows:
. .. â¢ â  . Havana, Dec. 9, 1896.
. . Dear Friend Jtuto: We are at present
under the sad impression, caused by the
death of our brave general, Antonio
Maceo, murdered, together with the
â¢â"!. greater part of his staff, by the Spaniards,
" .acting under the assassin, Major Cirujeda,
= and -as instrumental in this 'horrible
"drama Maeeo's surgeon, Dr. Maximo Zer
tucha. '
'â¢ : . "Convinced as Weyler was that he could
do nothing against our gallant general,
â; who bo irpeatedly defeated the Spanish
\ forces. lf^'i^^, Apl > Itu*. iv? < t c6ri_<cÂ«i?eVi' Â»be
:,': ,' idea of appeasing his beastiy instincts by
..'_ C"ld-'blooaed murder, and making the best
y of the secret relations between Dr.'Zer-
V tucha and the Marquis of Ahumada, con
. cocted the hellish scheme. , -
' .. "Weyler took the field and in hi ab
.... sence Ahumada proposed, through Zer
â ' tucha, a conference with Maoeo, to take
place at a certain point in the province of
â  -/Havana, with a view of arranging plans
for the cessation of hostilities on the basis
, of Cuba's independence and a monetary
indemnity to Spain, with, moreover, cer
tain advantages that would be agreed
upon for Spanisn commerce and Spanish
capital here invested. To carry out the
plans orders bad been given to the detach
ments of troops stationed at the trocha in
the section between Mariol and Guana
juaco for Maceo with his staff to pass the
military line unmolested. The combina
tions took time to mature aud to give the
semblance of truth. Ahumada feigned
that before acting he mu*t make known
his plans to Weyler for his previous ap
. proval ; and this explains the sudden ar
rival of Weyler at Havana and hia prompt
retnrn to Pinar del Rio.
"Having arranged the conditions and
plnce of meeting M;tceo crossed the trocha
: over the road to Guayajaco without being
niolpsted by the forts, but once arrived at
the place decided upon he and his party
were greeted by tremendous volleys from
the forces under Major Cirejuda, lying
conveniently in ambush. Most of the offi
cers fÂ«JI with General Maceo. Zertucha is
alive, because he was aware of the scheme,
And remained in the rear. The Spaniards
, know where the bodies are, but are bent
on feigning ignorance to blot ont the
vestiges of the crime.
"Havana and all Spain are rejoicing be
cause in the midst of their stupidity they
hope that the war may end with the deatn
of this gallant leader. Far from this, the
spirit of the Cubans has grown more ar
dent, and to-day the latter are resolved to
ruake every sacrifice before laying down
their arms to the relentless tyrants, and
in this province of Havana, where our
army is less numerous and has less means
of defense, the Cubans are operating with
greater activity than ever, and not a day
passes but that we do not hear in this city
the firing on Guanabajaco. The Spaniards
may treacherously murder, some of our
patriots, but there is no earthly power
that could annihilate the spirit of liberty
floating now Â«s ever over the Cnban peo
ple."
Speaking of the lettter, Mr. Haua said :
"Maceo is dead, but Cuba will live long.
The death of no one man can crnsh the
brave spirit of the patriots of Cuba who'
are fighting gallantly for liberty. Maceo
waÂ» not killed fairly or in honest battle,
but through the mnrderons treachery of
his physician, Dr. Zertncha. and the act
ing captain-general of Cuba, the Marquis
â Ahumada. Thirty-four members of his
Utaff we're murdered with himâ every man
I r Â»f the staff with, the exception of tne
. treacherous Zeriucha.
"The Spaniards say," added Mr. Haua,
"that they do not know where Maceo's
body is. They know full well. They
have buried it to cover their treachery to
a degree, and will exhume it soon to say,
'Ah; here is the body of Maceo.'
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL
"From to-day Cuba will fight harder
than ever before. This will be a sad day
for Spain.
"I do not know who will succeed Ma
ceo," said Mr. Haua, "but I think it wili
be Rios Rivera, a brave and intelligent
soldier."
ATLANTA, Ga., Dec. 12.â The Constitu
tion's Key West special gives the follow
ing account of Maceo's death, indicating
his betrayal and implicating Dr. Zer
tucha:
"Your correspondent is now enabled to
state upon the most undoubted authority
that the death of Maceo was a premedi
tated assassination and that the failure to
produce his body is because it is mutilated
and would shoe* even Spanish official
sensibilities.
"It seems that General Maceo bad
planned a successful crossing of the trocha
and that, taking the sea route with a
bodyguard, be was to rejoin his fortes east
of Mariel. This was accomplished in
safety and while standing alone within
sight of a line of skirmishers the general
was shot down by men in hiding, who
were await ng their victim. His body
was then hacked up by the assassins.
"It has been well known for a year past
that there was a price set upon Maceo's
head, and that Captain-General Weyler's
first official act upon reaching the island
was to give recognition to the plateodos,
bands of freebooters. These men, follow
ing in the wake of both armies, would
murder and plunder, and when chased
down by the indignant Cubans would find
protection within the Spanish lines, while
the latter would officially deny all knowl
edge of the murderers.
"A few weeks ago a band of these men
attacked a convent in the province of
Puerto Principe, which was filled with
young girls, who were most shamefully
abused. Some of these men were caught
by General Lacet, the insurgent leader,
and executed, while the greater part of
thsni lound protection within Spanish
lines. Although the enormity of their
crime was known and their victims were
convent schoolgirls the criminals were
protected from molestation and are to-day
free.
"These are the men whom General
Weyler has spent hundreds of thousands
of dollars to attach to his cause and
through whom he has ordered the killing
of foreigners whom he dared not call up in
court. He has made offers of reward for
tbe assassination of insurgent leaders.
For three weeks it has been known in
Havana that a clever br.be was out for the
surrender of General Maceo. It was to the
effect that he held the ticket which calied
for the grand prize of 860,000 in tbe Hav
ana lot-tery, and upon Weyler's departure
for the hills several days ago it was
breathed about that tbe man who killed
Maceo couid have the prize. The story of
Maceo's death as told from official sources
sustains fully the theory of assassination.
General Maceo, instead of crossing the
trocha directly witn his men, was through
some covert influence induced to pass
Mariel on boat and to reach bis forces on
tne east side of the death line. There
everything was in readiness by tbe con
spirators, and the brave leader fell a vic
tim to the trap into which he had walked.
It is.considered very singular that Maceo's
physician, Maximo Zeriucha, was allowed
to surrender and is treated with distinc
tion.
"The depression into which the Cubans
were thrown upon the first announcement
of Maceo's death, now that the fact of his
assassination is confirmed, has changed
to that of desperate determination." â 
Â«
WHERE IS SPANISH CHIVALRY?
Delegate I'nltna Speak* of General
3lacet>'Â» A*Â»a**inatioii.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 12.â The
Cuban Junta in this city received the fol
lowing telegram from their Jacksonville
agent, P. A. Huau, this afternoon: .^:'l,
"Receivea letter from Havana confirm
ing death of Maceo and staff by a combi
nation between Marquis Ahumada, second
in command to General Wevler, and Dr.
Zertucha. They were murdered."
Delegate Estrada Palma, after the re
ceipt of tne above, dictated a statement
for the press. It was as follows:
"The news does not surprise me, because
the first reports were so contradictory that
they read like a mystery. I was inclined
to believe that the news was false at first,
but that if General Maceo was dead it was
through the assassin's knife. It seems
now that he has been muvdered.
"General Weyler in addressing the
crowd from the balcony of his house
seemod anxious to shirk credit for the re
sponsibility of Maceo's death when he
said that the victory was clearly due to
Ahumada. Perhaps bis conscience begins
to feel remorse. This very act of the
Spanish general proves the straits of the
Hpanish army. They must resort to
treachery.
"They did not face Maceo. They stabbed
him in the back. Let me ask where is fho
Spanish chivalry of which they boast so
much?"
CONGRESS MAY SOW ACT.
Maceo' Â» Murder Will Sot Help the Came
of Spain.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 12.â The
news of the alleged assassination of Maceo
under the cover of what was practically
a flag of truce, is accepted as true at the
Cuban legation here, and was received
with a thrill of horror by Congressmen
who learned of it If autnentic informa
tion of Mr. Haua'B story should be re
ceived from Acting Consul - General
Springer in Havana, some immediate
action by Congress may be looked for in
the coming week.
There are facts in Haua's story which,
as the Cubans here believe, fit In with
previous reports and make them intel
ligible. It was regarded as incompre
hensible that a rough-and-tumble fighter
like Maceo should be killed in silk under
wear and with his jewelry on his person,
but if he was riding out for a parley
nothing would be more natural to a Cuban
than to attire himself in his most gorgeous
array.
Resolutions of inquiry on the snbj ci
will probably be introduced in one or both
Houses of Congress Monday next.
PROSTI ACETUN DEMANDEO

iÂ»ft Atrticitle:
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 12.â The dis
patches teliing of the assassination of
General Antonio Maceo by the Spanish sol
diem have arouseu indignation among the
friends of Cuba in this city. General
Daniel E. Sickles did not hesitate in de
claring the affair an outrage.
"If the story of the murder of General
Maceo is true," said he, "it warrants

prompt action on the part of the United
States to put an end to this barbarous
kind of warfare. It is in Hue with other
acts of the Spanish and, I think, calls for
immediate action."
Chauncey M. Depew said: "If the re
port be tmÂ« no language can characterize
it It is simply a cowardly assassination.
It is hard to believe that so brave a man
as Maceo should meet with such
a wretched fate. The confirmation of it
will stir the people of this country as
nothing else has done since the Cuban re-
bellion began."

v MADRID, Spain, Dec. 12.â The killing
of Maceo is likely to result in promotion
and other honors for Major Cirujeda, : who
commanded the Spanish force in the "en
gagement" in which the rebel leader lost
hi 3 life. Queen Regent Christina to-day
received Major Cirujeda's wife and eldest
son. - , ; 'â 
' The Queen Regent spoke warmly in
praise of Major Cirujeda's; bravery in at
tacking a largely superior force of rebels,
the official dispatches showing that the
Spaniards were outnumbered four to one.
She promised as a token of her apprecia
tion of Major Cirujeda's action to under
take the expenses of the education of his
son. '
VE TERAN ARE HOUSED.
They Are Heady to March to Cuba and
.tight the Traitort.
PITTSBURG, Pa., Dec. 12.â When the
news of the reported assassination of
Maceo, the Cuban leader, was bulletined
at the office of the United Associated
Presses in Pittsburg this evening they
were read by thousands, and Hnain was
denounced in the most vigorous language.
Sympathy with the Cubans and their
cause was aroused to an astonishing de
gree. A reporter of the Leader visited G.
A, R. Post No. 162 in Allegheny to inter
view some of the representative veterans
on the Cuban question.
The post was just adjourning when
Commander Brown beard from the re
porter ttie news of Maceo's assassination.
He raised his gavel and called the post to
order again. The reporter was required
to repeat his story.
As they heard the reading of the report
of the attack upon Maceo while under the
protection of the flag of truce, every one
of the fifty grizzled veterans piesent
pressed eagerly forward. The reading fin
ished, there was a moment's silence.
Then Comrade R. C- Miller said firmly
andslowlv: ''If ih is be true, lam ready
to go to Cuba to-morrow."
"Here, too," said others.
"The cowards," hissed many.
A general and earnest talk followed, in
which the most intense interest was evi
denced. "If this be true we will all go to
the aid of the Cubans," shouted a speaker.
The answering chorus was, "That's what
we will."
The general sentiment prevailing was
that the United States should extend im
mediately a powerful arm to the speedr
assistance of the struggling band of pa
triots in Cuba.
WEELEN IS SATISFIED
Brutal Butchery and Attataination
I'leane the Captain- General.
HAVANA, Cuba, De. 12.â A reporter
had an interview this evening with Gen
eral Weyler, who returned to Havana last
night from the province of Pinar del Rio.
When asked concerning his opinion of
tha campaign in general he said that he
was very well satisfied with the course of
events and expressed the hope that in a
short time there would be a change that
would modify some of the aspects of the
situation.
He was asked concerning the result of
his operations in Pinar del Rio, and re
plied that he was pleased with the out
come, since the rebels in that province are
now broken up into small bands and are
rapidly losing | ground in the/ hills, the
Spanish forces dislodging them from their
hiding places. .â  ' !;â¢.'.'â¢â â â ' , v * Til * n; ''.!/â¢*"â

Speaking of Rios Rivera, who it is
supposed will succeed Maceo in command
of the rebels in Pinar del Rio, General
Weyler remarked that he was now at the
head of the insurgent parties in that
province.
rie added that Rivera had no history as
a leader of men, nor did he have tne ca
pacity to lead his forces. He had reason
to believe that Rivera would not resist the
Spanish troops very long, and thought it
would take about twenty days more to
terminate the' insurrection in Pinar del
Rio.
THOMAS' TOUR IN CUBA.
Says Spain Will Have to Kill All the
Insurgent a to End the War.
CHICAGO, 111., Dec 12.â Charles N.
Thomas returned to Chicago from a
month's visit in Cuba, where he went to
get material for a lecture. He suid he was
watched day and night by a Spanish de
tective and traveled as a land agent. He
obtained written authority in Havana,
which, in addition to his American pass
port, enabled him to cross the trocha and
make his observations, but that 20,000
soldiers whom he passed would have asked
nothing better than to kill him with a
knife. He asserted that if the Cubans can
hold out the year they will never have to
win a pitched battle, yellow fever and
small-pox doing more deadly work than
the army of the, insurgents could do with
bullets. He estimated Spain's daily ex
pense of conducting the war at $300,000.
He added: >
"It is liberty or death with the Cubans.
Spain will have to crush out the lit* of
every insurgent before she can end the
war. No compromise will be accepted
now. Only one-sixth of the island is
under cultivation. The Cubans, if free,
would ask for annexation to the United
States, and then the garden spot of the
world would be thrown open to American
colonists. Cuba could support 10,000,000
people, and under American enterprise
would become ihe greatest wealth-pro
ducing spot in the world. Henceforth
my voice will be uplifted in the interest of
the patriots."

Ohio National Guard for service* in Cuba.
It is said that already fifty men have been

_\>r.irfiÂ« ar>d Statehood.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec 12.â The prop
osition, seriously set forth by a Chicago
newspaper, to suspend the representation
of the State of Nevada in Congress be
cause of its incompetency in point of popu
lation; just as the rights of the Southern
States were suspended during (he war, is
reluctantly disapproved by the Boston
Herald, to which the equity of the action
ia more apparent than its legal possioility.
A better method to settle the Nevada
trouble, according to the Herald, would be
to agree to the onion of Nevada with
Utah.
IN QUEST OF
SLAYER DUNHAM
Officers Gather at San Diego
to Seek for the
Murderer.
Belief That They Have Located
H.m Below the Mexican
Boundary.
Plans Carefully Laid to Eff ct His
Capture end Hasten
Back.
BAN DIEGO, Cal., Dec. 12.â Detective
George E. Gard arrived here this after
noon on a mysterious errand. Deputy
United States Marshal Covarrubias has
been here for a day or two, and the pres
ence of those officers aroused the curiosity
of the local officials. Through one* of
them, who enjoys the confidence of the
up-country officers, it was learned that
Sheriff Lyndon oi Santa Clara County
was expected to arrive here to-morrow,
and that a hunt was to be made for Mur
derer Dunham, the author of the horrible
tragedies at Campbell on May 26 last, when
the McGlincy family were stricken down.
Though trie visiting sleutb.3 have kept
very silent regarding their quest, and de
clared when its obj-ct became known
that they believed Dunham to be
hiding in the country north of here, it is
known almost to a certainty that they in
tend to cross the Mexican line. Evidently
they believe they have the Campbell fugi
tive located beiow the border, and are
planning to surprise and capture him
and then hasten back with him to Ameri
can soil. So secret have they kept their
movements that it is doubtful whether
they have cone through the formality of
obtaining permission to * pursue the
search in Mexico, fearing that such a
course might result in a warning reaching
Dunham.
Ex-Marshal Qard was asked as to his
intentions to-night. He displayed con
siderable annoyance and asked at once for
the name of the officer who had given the
thing away. This was not divulged.
"Well," said tne detective, "I don't see
how they eot onto it. 1 heard from Mr.
Lyndon, the Sheriff at San Jose, about
Tuesday, in response to a tip I had sent
him. I had received word from a friend
that Dunham was supposed to be some
where between San Jo^e and Los Angeles.
So far as I know Mr. Lyndon is not coming
down here."
"Which way was Dunham heading?" .
"He was about half way between San
Jose and Los Angeles.' 1
"Do you deny that you are here after
Dunham?"
"Oli, you can't ask me to tell you what I
am here for. I really can't do that, you
know. I came down here last July and
visited Dunham's bee ranch at Dulzura.
It was thought that, knowing this
country, he might head this way, but I
didn't find any signs of him. The business
I am on now is a quien sabe caseâ there
might be something in it and there mighc
not. If there is anything in it at all it is
a big thingâ l will say that much. Now
don't ask me any more."
Local officials take this statement with
a grain of allowance. When Sheriff Lyn
don arrives to-morrow, the party 'will
tney declare, strike southward instead of
to the north, and not stop until they are
well across the border, possibly on the
Lower California peninsula. Having
caught their man â if they do take him â
they are quite likely to waive the formal
ity of an extradition. There is a possibil
ity that they are acting in conjunction
with the Mexican authorities.
That the officers believe that they have
a "straight tip," as to the muiderer's
whereabouts is shown by their actions
and the many telegrams received and sent.
Dunham is well acquainted with the
mountains of this county, and has a good
general knowledge of . Lower California.
He could have hidden there all the time
since his escape without being seen.
. .. " " : â  . -*'- â "*â Â»"' " .
MEXICO THEIR DESTINATION
Sheriff Gard and Party Will Probably
Crons the Boundary.
LOS ANGELES. Cal., Dec. 12.â When
ex-Marshal Gard left this city and stole to
San Diego, where he is at preseut in com
pany with northern officers who had as
sembled at the seaside rendezvous just as
quietly, he possessed information regard
ing the whereabouts of James Dunham,
the sextuple murlerer of Santa Clara
County, or Dunham's double. Evidently
the detective has laid his plans well for
the capture of mis man, and within forty
eizht hours the success or failure of his
mission will be known. Those having
personal,and friendly relations with Major
Gard have known for some time that he
and Sheriff Lyndon of San Jose have htd
a great deal of correspondence respecting
the fugitive.
Gard's known sagacity and cleverness,
as shown in the plan which resulted in th c
capture of Evans and Soatag in Fresno
County two years ago, and later his ex
ceeding brilliant coup in arresting Evans
and Morrell in the former's own house in
Visalia, has given him a standing with tne
constabulary of California which is en
joyed by few detectives. Sheriff Lyndon
has never made a move in this part of the
State without first consulting Detective
Gard.
It is known that Sheriff Lyndon has
never relaxed his vigilance nor eiven up
all hope of being able some day to land
Dunham in the County Jail at San Jose.
The supposition nere is that some one
believed to be Dunham has been located
below the Mexican line. Evidently the
news is of a reliable character, as the ac
tive but secret operations would indicate.
It has been believed for months that Dun
ham has been all this time in Mexico.
Gard is perfectly familiar with the whole
country down there, while he speaks and
understands the Spanish language and its
shades of Indian dialect.
As has often happened with crirniaals,
Dunham, if in Mexico heretofore, may
have tired of life among the peons and
taken the chances of returning, to Cali
fornia. If so, Gard. who has an able co
worker in San Diego, would most likely
know it first.

SANTA ROSA, Cal., Dec. 12.â A meet

Kearny street from Market to California
blazed under brilliant, white electric lights
last night.
Three arc lamps to each block were hung
I over the middle of the street and these in
connection with the liberal display of elec
tric lights in the shop windows flooded
the air with the nearest approach to sun
shine that the art of man bas been able to
produce.
The bringing into full view of the fronts
of the principal buildings on tbe street
with their graceful outlines and ornately
carved cornices standing embossed in
glowing color against the black Back
ground of tbe sky was the most remarka
ble feature of the new illumination. It
was a pleasing revelation to all who saw it.
In fact, the general effect was so satisfac
tory that it will be next to impossible to
discontinue the extra lights.
Another noticeable effect of tbe new il
lumination will be that all tbe other busi
ness streets will look so gloomy and dingy
in comparison that the merchants will
clamor for new lights, and the entire busi
ness part of tbe city will put on an up-to

that time comes San Francisco will be up
in the front rank with New York, Chicago,
and St. Louis, at least so far as appear

The new lights were displayed also on

This is only a starter for Kearny street,
for on next Saturday evening tor lights
will be extended to Montgomery avenue,

With Eczema
I was a sufferer for eight years from Eczema, bat
now am entirely cured. The palms of my bands
were covered and badly inflamed ; little white
blisters appeared, then would peel oS, leaving
a red, smooth surface, which would burn like
fire and itch. On the inside of the upper part of
my limbs, great red blotches would appear, and
as soon as I became warm, the burning and itch-
ing would begin. Night after night I would lie
awake and scratch, and almost go wild. I got a
box of Cuticura, and a bottle of Cuticura Rk-
holvent, and after a few applications I noticed

MORE LIGHTS.
Fourth and Ninth Streets Join in
the General March of
Progress.
Fourth street, from Market to Folsom,
is not going to be left behind in the gene
ral progress of improvements. This street,
with its spirited storekeepers, is about
to keep pace with the progressive move to
bring the business streets into noticeable
prominence by illuminating the streets
with arc lights.
In addition to this, the old '49 cobble
stone pavement must be removed and a
modern coat of concrete and bitumen take
its place.
These improvements the club members
intend to have just as soon as the neces
sary municipal appropriations can be
made to pave the street. The expense of
lighting the street by electricity will be
b^rne by the storekeepers.
At an informal meeting oi the merchants
hÃafcfewdays apo the following-named
businessmen were rlecied officers of :he
Fourth-street Clnb: President. Jonn T.
Sullivan, ex-Supervisor; vie -ure Went, G.
Gail; secretary, W. F. King; executive
committeeâ Messrs. King, btrauss, Cluff,
Sh?a and Laud.
The arrangements with the electric light
company have.Deen assumed by the Me -
chants' Association, and if nothing un
foreseen occurs the current will be turned
on to the street lamps by next Saturday
evening.
Ninth street is also f\i line to bring that
street into touch with the other outside
business streets.
To accomplish this object John Hayden,
the butcher, who was the pioneer intro
ducer of electric light* on that street, is
beinn ably assisted by Messrs. Owens,
O'Connor Bros, and others, who have been
the promotors of thb improvement move
ment on the blocks between Market and
Howard streets.
In all probability final arrangements
wiiJ be made by which the street will be
illuminated by next Saturday evenin.Â».
GREEB WRITES COMEDY,
A Play for Miss Kidder With
Plenty of 'eric- Comic
Hypnotism.
"A FixÂ»d Lea" Soon to Bs Produced
by the Well-Known Actress-
Private Read n? Last N ght.
William Greer Harrison has written an
other t>lay â this time a comedy. It was
all prearranged with Miss Kidder when
she was 'here gaining fame and good
opinions in "Sans Gene." Miss Kidder
said she wanted a play and Mr. Harrison
consented to evolve one for her. He had
something of it in mind at the time and
talked it over with her, and Miss Kidder
said it was just the thine.
She went away and Mr. Harrison went
to work. A few days ago he received a
telegram of anxious inquiry as to the
status of the performance and the answer
was returned that a copy hud been mailed
to her that very day. So it is all com
pleted and iast evening to a Jittle party of
friends assembled at the author's home
the play was given it first reading.
George Adam, who has been assisting
Mr. Harrison in some details, especially
in arranging and interpolating the stage
"business," was the reader.
"A Fixed idea" is the title ana hyp
notism is made use of in evolving the
rather novel and somewhat daring theme.
Tbe heroine is a delicate, highstrun.-.
brilliant young woman of varying moods!
disposed to speak out just what occurs to
her. Her name is Mac-el and she is called
Queen Mab â which U something of an in
dex to her character.
The villain is Felix Ferris, a stock
broker, who has powers as a hypnotist.
When Mabel's husband diea, considerably
before the play opens, Felix, who was the
customary lriend of the family, immedi
ately began to make love to Mabel, who
refused Biro. Ha placed her under a hyn*
notic spell and tried to ruin her. He
failed in this, but hoping to break down
her moral safeguards undertook to create
the impression in her mind while under
a spell that she had been guilty with him.
In this he was successful and this is the
"fixed idea" which gives the motif to the
play.
The opening scene is laid at Lake Tahoe
and there Mailes' hand is sougnt by
Major Tobin Standish of the United States
army â a gentleman after Mabel's heart in
all senses of the term. She is |sar
rounded by friends and relative;* and there
is much; pretty byplay, Mabel being any
thing but a melancholiac.
She refuses to allow man or woman to
kiss her, however, because of the sense
that her lips woulrt be denied. Ferris
seeks ncr out here and again places her
under the spell, and as he covers her face
with kisses is discovered by her lover and
others, who come to the rescue with tne
cry of "coward." This is tbe first curtain.
The second act is still at Lake Tahoe,
and is a rather strong scene between
Mabel and her lover, which opens by the
young woman gayly offering to show the
army officer the edge of her "lingerie,"
proceeds by more than half confessing,
very seriously, to her unholy relationship
with Ferris, and when he, in hi* horror,
has left her alone, concludes with her
making an effective fall, with curtain.
In the third act Ferris undertakes to
impoverish bis rival, Major Staudisb, by
plunging his money, which, as stock
broker, has been entrusted to him, but
Mabel, who has heard of it, circumvents
him by employing another broker. The
announcement by her that Jack is a mil
lionaire and Ferris himself is a pauper
forms the third curtain.
In the fourth the villain comes borrow
ing a few hundred to set him up again and
consents, in consideration thereof, to be
hypnotized by Dr. Lake, who has been
afford ing.more or less amusement through
ti>e preceding acts by practicing hypnot
ism and other things. Under the spell and
in tbe presence of Mabel he tells all about
itâ how she has been suffering from a fixed
idea tbat was nothing more than a hyp
notic suggestion.
And so all ends happilyâ or, which, is
an alternative to be left to Miss Kidder
herselfâ Mabel, having been purged of
her imaginary sin, accepts the kisses that
she has ho ionp refused, and in excess of
ioy her weak heart leaps out of bounds
aria breaks the vessel. She dies in her
lover's arms.
Tuis is the ending which Mr. Harrison
thinks ihe mo-e artistic and which he be
liever Miss Kidder will adopt.
A vote taken at tbe table after tbe read
ing last night among tbe lit le party who
bad heard it found the judgment equally
divided.
"A Fixed Idea" is a comedyâ for this
serious story is enlivened by Charles
Josselyn, a manufacturer of brain invig
orators; Tom Harcourt, a young lawyer;
Florence Wiilmott, Ethel Williarrt, Mrs.
Willoughby, Sam Lake and Mabel's
little girl â all of whom are engaged in
making merry.
The characters are all drawn from life,
Mr. Harrison says, all well-known San
Franciscans.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1896.
OVERCOME BY THE
ILLUMINATING GAS
Samuel Porter Putnam and
Miss May L. Collins
Found Dead.
Do Net Believe Their
Deaths Was Due to an
Accident.
Mr Putnam Was President of the
American Secular Union and Oace
Pub islied i Journal Here.
BOSTON, Mass., Pec. 12.â Samuel P.
Putnan and Miss May L. Collins were
found dead tliis morning in a flat which
bad been occupied fora wees past by Miss
Collins. The deaths were aue to asphyx
iation and the police think were caused
by accident. Both were found lying on
the floor of the room and were fully
dressed. From one of the gas-burners the
gas was escaping in full force. Mr. Put
nam, who was 56 years of age, and Miss
Collins, 20 years old, were free-thinkers
and had been traveling together on a lec
turing tour.
Mr. Putnam Broke in Paine Hall last
Sunday night. It was the intention of the
two to leave to-day for New York, where
a banquet is to be tendered to prominent
free-thinker 3 to-morrow evening. Mr.
Putnam came from Chichester, N. H., and
Miss Collins from Midway, Ky. f where her
parents reside.
It appears that about 8 o'clock last night
Mr. Putnam and Miss Collins entered the
Jntter's room, preparatory to starting for
Stoneham. Shortly aiterward the escap
ing gas was detected by tbe janitor, but
he could not find any leak. This morning
the smell of gas was much stronger and
was finally traced to Miss Collins* room.
The door was locked, but was opened
after the key had been pushed out and
another inserted in its place. Both per
sons were dead. On a table in the room
was a bottle of whisky partly filled. Mr.
Putnam had only appeared at tbe bouse,
it is said, as Miss Collins' visitor.
It is probable that Miss Collins' body
will be cared for by local freethinkers.
Mr. Pntnam had traveled extensively
throughout the country and bad quite
recently lectured in Chicago and that vi
cinity. He bad written a number of books
on free thought.
In the room adjoining that in which tbe
bodies were found was the book entitled,
"Four Hundred Years of Free Thought,"
written by Mr. Putnam, and containing
his autobiography. According to this be
entered Dartmouth College in 1858. Three
years later he went to the war as a private,
was promoted to captain in 1863 and
served in the Department of the Gulf un
til the end of the war.
He was graduated from the Theological
Seminary in Chicago in 1868, and preached
in orthodox pulpits. In 1871 he joined
tbe Unitarian denomination, and subse
quently became a free-thinker. He was
elected secretary of the American Secular
Union in 1887, and three years later was
elected president of the union, and at that
time established in San Francisco a jour
nal entitled #> Free Thought." He was
afterwaid chosen president of tbe Califor
nia State Liberal Union. This publication
suspended in 1891, and the next year he
was elected president of the Free-thought
Federation of America, and held that posi
tion at the time of his deatu.
There is more than one mysterious point
that will have to be cleared up before it
can be definitely known whether tbe
deaths were accidental or not. It was
stated to-day that Miss Collins and Mr.
Putnam were preparing to go Soutb last
night, but this has been found to be incor
rect. Mhs Collins was in Stoneham,
where she took dinner.
Returning to Boston in the afternoon it
is supposed that she took supper with Mr.
Putnam, and the two came to Miss Col
lins' room together about 8 o'clock in the
evening. Tne door was locked and the
gas was lighted and was seen to be burn
ing as late as midnight. The bottle of
whisky found on a table in the room had
been seen there previously, and was not
disturbed by them last nig t.
There was found, however, a bottle of
benedictine in which about a pint of
liquor was missing. There was a Blight
wound on tbe woman's head, which may
have been caused by a fall. The fact that
t!i-' eescook turned bard and the escaping
gas made & hissing sound that could be
distinctly heard ten feet away, while the
room was not seven feet wide, would tend
to explode the theory that the gas had
been turned and left to escape.
CHICAGO, lix,, Dec 12.â Samuel Por
ter Putnam made his home in this city,
but spent most of bis time ai a lecturer in
all parts of the United States, vigorously
advocating the views of the free-thinkers.
Mr. Putnam had quarters at the office of
the American Secular Union, 141 South
Water street, and during the last year had
lived on the West Side when not on a lec
ture tour. He was not married, and leaves
no close relatives.
There was great surprise and sor
row at the, office of the American
Becular Union when the news was re
ceived. In a letter received from the
lead-r yesterday by Secretary E. C. Relch
wald Mr. Putnam wrote that he was feel
ing well and speaking to large audiences.
He added that he would return to Chicago
in March with Miss Collins, who was then
to go home to Kentucky. He sent his
best wishes to friends in this city.
Mr. Reichwald said: "For eighteen
years Mr. Putnam was a freethinker and
lecturer. He was also a talented writer
and above all a good man. His death iÂ» a
great blow to our cause."
Last month Mr. Putnam and Miss Col
lins were in Chicago, both taking an
active par* in the convention of the Amer
ican Secular Union and Freethought
Federation of America. Miss Collins left
her Kentucky home to come here for that
purpose, meeting Mr. Putnam for the first
time then. It was here they decided to
co-operate on a lecture tour. Mr. Putnam
was tbe foremost figure at the convention
here and was unanimously re-elected
president of the National organization,
which he was first chosen to lead in 1892.
His eloquent addresses, attacking and de
nouncing the orthodox Christianity, were
the feature? of the recent convention.
During Mr. Putnam's ministerial careej
he was pastor of churches at De Kaib ana
Malta, 111.; North Plate and Omaha,
Nebr. ; Evansrille and Vincennes, Ind. ;
Toledo, Ohio, and Northlieid, Masis. While
in the East he disavowed bis religious be
lief and became active iv the rauks oi ag
nosiics. Until 1887 he was employed in
the Custom-house at New York under the
Hayes edministration, and in that year
was elected secretary of the American Sec
ular Union. Last year he made an ex
tended tour of England and France, at
tracting much attention by bis addresses.
Among the books ne wrote which made
h.m rank among authors were "Pen Pic
tures of the World's Fair," "Four Hun
dred Years of Free Thought" and "Inger
soil and Jesus."
WAS well ' km own here.
I'utnam Edited "Ere* Thought" for
About a Tear.
Putnam was well and favorably known
among the members of the Secular Union
in this City, where he edited Free

THAT VEXED TURKISH QUESTION.
If the Powers Have Agreed to Control the
Sultan UnclÃ Sam Has Not Been
Informed.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 12.â A Sun
special from Washington says: Govern
ment officials at Washington are as yet
without official information regarding tbe
agreement reached by the powers for in
tervention in the Eastern question, but
say that until the British Foreign Office
makes publio its terms and notifies the
representatives of the various foreign
countries having legations in London, the
Stute Department cannot be uavised by
Embassador Bayard of the momentous
news.
It is said that while intimation has been
received that progress was being made be
tween Russia, France and Great Britain
whicu promised a satisfactory settlement
of the whole Turkish problem, so sudden a
determination to inform the isu.tan of the
ultimatum was not anticipated.
One of the Assistant Secretaries of State
practically acknowledged yesterday that
tne reason why Minister Terrell had not
met the cruiser Bancroft at Smyrna
and taken her to Constantinople
was that an intimation had been
received from Russia that in a very
brief 4 time reiorms in Turkey would be
carried out through the combined efforts
of the powers, the Dardanelles opened to
the navies of the world and that any at
tempt then to secure the United State-*
guaraship against >he protest of the Porte
might tend to complicate matter; and in
tenere with the proceeding of the pro
gramme.
At that time dispatches |to newspapers
stated in positive terms that the Bancroft
would proceed through the Dardanelles.
It was tne purpose oi Minister Terrell to
carry out the plan then set :onh, and
there is little doubt that it would have
been accomplished and not a gun turned
on the little vessel, when tbe Porte was
brought to recognize tnat the United
Suites would sustain it* contention that
the straits were not closed to American
vessels by sending the Bancroft through.
JViiniÃter Terrell had little doubt thÂ»-n,
it is now officially known, of his ability to
secure a firman, and tbe Bancroft would
non have been anchored in the Golaen
Horn but for unexpected developments in
the Turkish question, arising out of the
rapid work accomplished by Russia in
bringing the other European powers to
agree to concerted action in settling the
wnole affair.
Since the Bancroft incident it has been
known here that it was only a question vi
a short time^.when the visit of the Czar to
England and France would bear fruil and
tbat Europe would hear of the agreement
reached between the powers to act jointly
in treating with the Sultan, or use force if
diplomacy fa led.
It is now i sserted that the President's
reference in his message to the necessity
of retaini.ig a naval fleet in Eastern waters
was due to the expected break in the
Sultan's administration, which, when it
comes, will no doubt require the presence
of every vessel there to look after the
Americans stationed in the small cities
along the Syrian coast.
The prevalent impression here and es
pecialy at the State Department, which is
kept thoroughly advised when anything
occurs in* Europe regarding Turkey, is that
the Sultan will accept the propositions to
be submitted by the powers and promptly
acquiesce in tne demands made of him.

Maitachitseltn to Stake a .Splendid Gift
to the Xeto Cruiser.
BOSTON, Mass., Dec. 12.â Shortly after
the battleship Massachusetts comes out of
drydock the State she was named after
will present her with a bronze image of
Victory. It is a superb emblem, six feet
in height, which will be placed in front of
the turret, between the big guns.
This will be the finest gift of any State to
its naval namesake. The figure is that of
a female, lite size, and is toe creation of
Sculptor Bela L. Pratt. It is a winged
figure, and it appears to come toward the
spectators with confident tread. Tbe arms
are rigidly held down in front, cltsping a
sword on which is inscribed the word
"Victory."
On the bust is a steel buckler and on the
head a helmet. The whole conception i 3
one of strensth and vigor, with a determi
nation in the expression which is unmis
takable. The committee having the mat
ter in charge consists of B. F. Bouthwick,
Charles A. Towne, B. 8. Lovell and N. F.
Ryder. The committee expects to have
elaborate ceremonies in Boston Bay,
where the Massachusetts will anchor.

boose System.
WASHINGTON, D. C, D>c. 12.â The
report of Hon. Joseph 8. Miler, until re
cently Commissioner of Internal Revenue,
was made public to-day. Tv receipts for
the year ended June 30, 1896. were $ 146,
-830,615, an increase of $3,584,538 over the
receipts of the preceding year. For the
current fiscal year the Commissioner esti
mates that the receipts will aggregate
$150,000,000.
Compared with the receipts lor the pre
ceding year the receipts df the bureau on
the several objects of internal taxation lor
the fiscal year ended June 30, 1896, were
as follows: Spirits $80,670,070. increase
$807,443; tobacco $30,711,629, increase
$1,006,721; fermented liquors $33,884 235,
increase $2,143 617; oleomargarine $1,219,
-432, increase $189,778; banks, Dangers, etc.,
$134 (first assessment); miscellaneous*
$445,113, a decrease of $183,600.
The quantities of various articles on
which tax was paid during tne fiscal year
1896 are as follows: Spirits, distilled from
aoples, peac es and grants, 1,440,810 gal
lons, an increase of 338.017 gallons over
tne preceding year; spirits, distilled from
matedals other than apples, peaches and
crapes, 67,039,910 gallons, decrease 7,413,-
I^7 gallons; fermented liquors, 35,029,098
barrels, increase 2,264.687 barrels; cigars
and ciieroots, 4 237,755,943 in number, in
crease 73,783,603; cigarettes weighing not
over three pounds per 1000, 4,042,391,640 in
number, increase 714,987,860; cigarettes

increase 5,397,499 pounds; oleomargarine,
47.623,773 pounds, decrease 5,640,897
pounds.
It is shown by the report that the cost
of collecting the internal revenue was
$4,086,292, and the Commissioner estimates
that lor the fiscal year ending June 30,
1898, the expanses of the Dureau will be
$4,369,000.
Tbe registered distilleries seized durine
the fiscal year numbered 210, the illicit
distilleries seized and destroyed numbered
1925, while the value of property reported
for seizure aggregated $3Q8,449. Eight
hundred and thirty-nine persons were ar
rested for violating the internal revenue
laws.
The whole number of grain distilleries
reaistered during the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1896, was 1333, of whith number
1351 were operated.
Tbe larger portion of the decrease in the
number registered and operated occurred
in tbe class of distilleries having the
smaller capacity for the production of
spirits.
The total number of grain, molasses and
fruit distilleries registered during the year
is 6689, and the total number operated is
6187.
There was an increase of 3758 in the
number of all kinds of distilleries regis
tered and of 3753 in the number of all
kinds operated during the fiscal year
eiuled June 30, 1896, as compared with the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1895.
The quantity of molasses for the pro
duction of spirits other than rum has be
come extremely large, numbering during
the past fiscal year 3,507,609 gallons, with
a product therefrom or 2,642,322 gallons.
The quantity of grain used for the pro
duction of spirits durine the fiscal year
ended 'June 30, 1896 (18,630,618 bushels),
shows an increase of 1,130,907 bushels over
the actual amount of grain used in tne
preceding year. The number of gallons
of spirits produced from grain during the
year, 82,456,153, shows an increase of
4,283,641 gallons over the production for
the year ended June 30, 1895. The yield
of spirits from each bushel of giain is 442
gallons.
The quantity of molasses used for the
production of rum during the fiscal year
(1.891,356 gallons) shows a decrease of 328,
-191 gallons from the quantity used in the
previous year. The quantity of rum dis
tilled from molasses during the fiscal year
(1,493,228 gallons) shows a decrease of 286,
855 gallons from the product of the pre
vious year.
Concerning the general bonded ware
houses tbe Commissioner has this to say:
Under the general provisions of law the
privilege of removal to and storage In these
warehouses is extended to all kinds of distilled
spirits without exception ana consequently
several of the warehouses so established have
been mainly used for temporary occupancy by
spirits Jor which the warehouses served merely
as distributing agencies instead at lurnishing
a convenient place for the permanent storage
of spirits which requite to be aged and ripened
as was conteroplttted by the statute.
The practice of distributing these spirits, de
signed for immediate consumption, irom the
warehouse rather than irom the distillery,
has resulted, of course, in delaying the pay
ment of the tax thereon until the expiration
of the period covering the transportation of
the spirits from tha distillery to the ware
house and their subsequent disposition to the
trade, and consequently the natural loss of
the taxable artice occurring during such de-
Jay, is in respect to the tax transferred to the
Government instead of falling upon the owner,
-by whom it has properly been hitherto borne.
In view of this condition of affairs, I have
deemed it best to discontinue sucn of those
warehouses as were manifestly not subserving
the purpose of their establishment.
I would recommend that tbe statute in this
regard be so amended as to limit the privilege
of storage in these warehouses to such spirits
as may be approved by this office; and, fur
ther, that provision be made for a charge of
not less than 25 cents each for tbe general
bonded warehouse stamps and re- warehousing
stamps which are affixed to paokwges oi
spirits upon transfer irom a distil, ery ware
house to a (teueral bonded warehouse or from
one general bonded warehouse to another,
whicu charge, it is believea, would mainly de
fray the expense to which the Government is
put for tne supervision and control ot these
warehouses. Unless action to this effect should
be taken it would seem to be best that the au
thority fur their > stablishment ba withdrawn.

IS NOT JEALOUS
Statesmen Appear to Be
Pleased With the Russo-
Chinese Treaty.
It Merely Gives the Czar the
Right to Run a Railroad
Through Manchuria.
Force of the Radical Party Directed
Against Chamb riain and His
Transvaal Policy.
LONDON, Esa., Dec 12.â The London
bureau of the United Associated Presses
has the highest authority for the state
ment that the Kusso-Chinese convention
is by no means a surprise to Lord Salis
bury, nor are the main clauses of the
agreement opposed to England's interests.
The Bubstance of the convention was dis
cussed upon the occasion of the visit of Li
Hung Chang to London, and was known
to Sir Nicholas O'Connor, the then retir
ing British Minister, before he left Peking
to assume the duties of British Embassador
i at St. Petersburg
The convention does not contain any
â  concession of territory, but only secures
to Russia the right to construct a railroad
through Manchuria to Viadivostock. The
branch railway to Port Arthur is purely a
Chinese enterprise.
The Right Hon. A. J. Balfour, First
Lord of the Treasury, speaking at Bristol
on February 3 last, while the Russo
â¢ Chinese treaty was pending, said that so
far from regarding with jealousy the ac
quisition by Russia of a commercial port
on the Pacific which would not be frozen
over to the exclusion of vessels six months
in every year, England would welcome it
as a distinct advance of civilization.
The whole force of the radical party is
to be directed at the earliest possible mo
ment against Chamberlain and the Gov
ernment's policy toward the Transvaal.
Behind the attack on the Government's
action generally tnere is a bitter hatred
toward the Colonial Secretary. Time has
not soitened the feelings which elicited at
every mention of his name in the meetings
of the National Liberal Club the cry of
"Judas."
So every possible advantage is taken to
show him up a prevaricating and un
scrupulous politician. The Labouchere
clique think they now have him on the
hip in connection with the Jameson reve
lations, although nothing that is new can
be garnered from the most recent develop
ments of the controversy.
Put in brief, the newest form of the
charges against Chamberlain is that Sir
John Willouchby and other officers lead
ing the raid on the Transvaal had Cham
berlain's assurance that he approved of
the movement and would support it. .
' There are hints from the Radical side
that an eminent politician who saw
Rhodes while he was in England pledged
himself to support the expedition. Here
Sir William Vernon Harcourt is aimed at.
There certainly exists. correspondence
which Sir Jjt:ftan\yUJoufthÂ£y'3 solicitors
Doia sifowingTf&kt~ Jumeifdn, Wilioughby
and other leaders of the raid had been
lea to believe that Chamberlain (for the
Government) and Sir William Vernon
r Harcourt (lor the opposition) nad given
their sanction to the attack ou the Trans
vaal. But it can be stated with absolute
certainty that tnere exists no documen
tary proof implicating either Chamberlain
or Sir William Vernon Harcourt. The
evidence which will be brought before the
Parliamentary committee will consist
cniefly of letters passing between Sir John
Willougbby, Dr. Jameson and brother of
ficers anent interviews with Chamberlain,
Sir William Harcourt and others. Neither
Cham berlain nor Sir William will be found
to have given themselves away by docu
mentary evidence.
The destruction of the English colonial
sugar industry ia supposed by the free
trade English press to be counterbalanced
by the growth of the English confection
and preserved fruit industry, which it is
claimed more than covers any loss arising
from the cessation of colonial trade. This
is true in an immediate practical sense,
and points the morals of the interviews on
the subject contained in dispatches to the
United Associated Presses, where the an
nexation of the British Antilles to the
United States was shown to be the natural
issue of the situation.
But the gravitation of the West Indian
colonies toward the United States is no
part of the programme of the Imperial
Federationists. Chamberlain's commis
sion of inquiry into the West Indian
sugar industry is such an obvious put-off
and so useless that the Imperial Federa
tion leaders will have nothing to do with
it. So, when Parliament meets there will
appear on the notice motions of the house
several proposals that the decaying condi
tion of the West Indian sugar industry
shall at onoe be met by a system of coun
tervailing duties.
Tue interest aroused by the revival in
an acute form of this trouble recalls the
opinion expressed by Mr. Gladstone some
ten years a^o, after the London conference
on the bounties system. "I think," he
said, "that both the trader and the work
man engaged in the business of refining
sugar have great reason to complain. My
desire is that the British consumer should
have bought sugar aud every commodity
at the lowest prices at which it can be pro*
duced without arbitrary favor to any of
those engaged in the competition, but i
cannot regard with favor any cheapness
which is produced by means of the con
cealed subsidies of a foreign state to a
particular industry, and with the effect of
crippling and distressing capitalists and
workmen engaged in a lawful branch of
British trade."
The quotation here is expressely made,
because on absolute official information it
will ultimately form the basis of the ac
tion of the English Government in settling
the question. Chamberlain knows the
absurdity of the commission, and thÂ« ulti
mate issue of the whole matter is that
either the continental bounty - giving
powers will abolish bounties or the
colonies obtain codntervailing duties.
CALMERS IS HOPEFUL.
Say* the Dock Laborer* Are Bound to
Win the Strike. - â¢
' ' . ; . LONDON, Eng., Dec. 12.â A representa
tive of the United Associated Presses has
had another interview with Thomas Cal
bery, secretary of the National Sailors'
and Firemen's Union. He found him full
of hope over the prospects of an interna
tional strike. Ballot papers from â¢ every
quarter, lie said, approved the strike.
Asked wnether he thought it should be
tentatively delayed to permit cf , further
organization, Calbery said ; that the gen
i eral feeling seemed about evenly balanced,
1 but an international strike would surely
I come if the employers refuse to do justice
* to (he men.
If a wholesale ; strike were forced 1 upon
them they would get the JNew York men
to join, for their condition was wretch
f. edlybad, even worst than London dock
laborers. Mr. McHugh had reported that
the American J men â¢ were ' well : organized,
that the American labor leaders knew the

SPOLIATION OF IRELAND.
Financial Reform* to Come Before the
:\ Jtritiith Parliament.
LONDON, Esq., Dec 12.â Dillon will
raise a debate on the address in reply to
the Queen's speech opening the session of
Parliament, calling attention to the report
of the commission on the financial rela
tions between Great Britain and Ireland.
The Irish party contemplates no division
on the debate.
But when the budget comes before the
House the combined Irish sections will in
sist upon an immediate adjustment of
Irish finance as reported upon by the
commission. The systematic spoliation of
Ireland of about Â£3,000,000 annually is too
much even for the Irish Unionists. Mr.
Balfour may probably claim that the ad
justment forms part of ttie coming "Irish
local government reform bill."
REV. CHARLES AND MATTIE.
Dr. Brown Talks About Their Meeting in
Chicago and of Her Attempts to
Blackmail Him.
CHICAGO. 111., Dec. 12.â The Rev. C.
O. Brown, late of California, whose sensa
tional meeting with Miss Mattie Overman
at a recent Salvation Army meeting at
Willard Hall was referred to in an even
ing paper, said to-day:
"The article with reference to the Wil
lard Hall incident is incorrect in several
places. When Miss Overman arose, as
others were doing, to 'testify," she was
not on the platform, but back of me on the
main floor of the hall.
"We bad been informed by the San
Francisco papers that she was on the way
East, and I was not surprised when I
recognized her voice, neither did I 'start
as though to rise,' neither did I 'bow my
head as though confused.' I turned and
looked at the young woman who has pub
licly and under oath testified that she de
liberately entered into a sbeme to black
mail me. When she saw me she was
manifestly surprised, very soon ceased
speaking, dropped into her seat, bowed
her head a moment and very soon after
spoke to her companions and went out.
I remained to the close of the meeting.
"The facts with regard to her writing
to me for money from Southern Cali
fornia are these: She wrote offering
to procure an affidavit from Mrs. Tun
r.el, if I would pay for it, but affirming
that my enemies were ready to pay for a
story against me and that they should tell
one if I did not meet her terms. I refused
her proposition indignantly. Her 'con
fession' appeared soon after and was her
fourth conflicting story, and to this last
'confession' she refuses to mase oath.
"Miss Overman confessed with tears
that bhe came to our home for the delib
erate purpose of doing what she coud to
injure us. In a previous mood she be
sought us to forgive her for so abusing our
hospitality. It must be for the public to
judge wbat credence to give her word."
AGAIN SHE IS TERESA DEAN.
As a Sequel to the Elopement of Dr.
Tollman, His Wife Secures a
Divorce in Chicago.
CHICAGO, 111.. Dec. 12.â There was a
sequel in the divorce court to-day of the
recent di-appearance of Dr. W. Lewis Tall
man, ex-house pbysician of the Great
Northern Hotel, with Jane McKinley
Cannon of Danville, 111., a married woman.
Dr. Taliman's wife, who as Teresa Dean,
gained a reputation by newspaper writing
in this city, filed a bill in the Circuit Court
at 12:3U o'clock to-day, asking for a decree
of divorce on the ground of infidelity, Mrs.
Cannon being named as the co-respondent.
At I_':34 o'clock Mrs Tallman was seated
in the witness chair in Judge Morton's
courtroom, and at 12:50 o'clock she walked
out as Teresa Dean again, taking with her
a decree of divorce which provides for an
allowance of $3000 a year as alimony. The
doctor's average annual income was stated
to be $10,000. No defense was set up, and
the defendant, who was seen in the city
yesterday for the first time since he eloped
October 28, authorized his attorney to
enter an appearance for him so that there
would be no delay. Her family coach
man bad heard the doctor say he loved
Mrs. Cannon and intended to marry her.
Teresa Dean and Dr.Tallman were married
at Racine, Wis., exactly five years ago
to-day.
SEW SYSTEM OF CHEOKING.
Designed to Prevent Fraud, in England*
Poatoffi.ce Department.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 12. -A Lon
don dispatch says: A thorough revision
of the system of bookkeeping in vogue
in the savings bank department of the
Government postoffice has been ordered,
as the result of the discovery of one of
the most gigantic frauds ever perpetrated
on this financial institution, and for
complicity in which the manager of
one of the sub- departments has just
been sentenced to five years' penal servi
tude.
The scheme adopted by the conspirators
was to open accounts with tne deposit ot
a few shillings in nearly 100 branch savings
banks. The convicted man, through his
position in the chief department, had
access to the general ledgers, and chanced
the entries so that they appeared as
pounds. In one case where $5 had been
deposited in a certain branch bank, the
general ledgers were so manipulated as to
so make it appear that the deposit was
one of $500. Each deposit was made in a
different name. Had not the scheme been
discovered by an accident, the Govern
ment mieht have been defrauded out of
over $50,000, when the entire deposits of
the conspirators were less than $500.
The Government financial experts are
now engaged in perfecting a ne ( w system
of checKing accounts between the general
and branch banks by which tuch a fraud
Will hereafter be impossible.
FOREIGH MISSIONARY WORK.
An Interesting Summary Prepared by
Dr. Strong.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 12.-A sum
mary o! ; Protestant foreign missionary
work throughout the world has been pre
pared by the Rev. E. E. Strong, D.D., edi
torial secretary of the American Board of
Foreign Missions. The totals compared
with last year show an increase in the
contributions of about $1,100,000, while in
the United States there has been a de
crease of about $70,000. -,
The British societies show a marked
falling off in the ; number of native labor
ers, largely owing to the fact that the war
in Madagascar has so ; interrupted; mis
sionary work that no reports are given
from that island.
In the United States, Canada, Great
Britain. Continental Europe, Australia,
India, Airica, etc., there are 267 societies,
4325 stations, 14.036 out stations, 6336 male
missionaries, 5675 female missionaries,
60,184 native laborers, 1,221,175 communi
cants. The income in dollars is $15,549,244.
Onltt One Cabinet Officer.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 12.â An argu

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1896.
MAJOR TAUSCH'S
BLACK RECORD
Dark Scheme Cooked Up
by the Secret Service
Chief.
Constantly Frightened the Kaiser
by His Faked Reports of
Impending Danger.
But as Prince B smarck Expressed It:
" These Scoundrels Have to Lie
in Order to Live"
BERLIN, Geemant, Dec. 12.â Since the
Emperor gave Freiherr Marschall yon
Bieberstein, Minister of Foreign Affairs,
an audience at Potsdam on Thursday it
has transpired it is the intention of the
Government to hasten the trial of Major
yon Tausch, the chief of the political
police, who is now in jail under charges of
perjury and forgery, tafcing the view that
the longer the affair is fcept^before the pub
lic the worse. The scandals attached
thereto will become public and the excite
ment over the revelations already made
will increase.
Major yon Tausch has employed the
eminent advocate, Dr. Schwindt, to de
fend him and also made an application for
his release on bail pending his trial, but
thi* request has been refused and he
wiil have to remain in jail until he is
arraigned in court. Failinz to obtain his
clent's liberty on bail, Dr. Schwindt then
as&ed the onbllc prosecutor not to call the
case for a month as the defense would re
quire that length of time at least to pre
pare for trial and the postponement of tne
case until the end of January is probable,
despite the desire of the prosecution to
expedite matters.
Besides frequently alluding to instances
of Tausch's alleged crimes of forgery and
perjury or bis indictment thereto the
newspapers are filled with incidents of his
life. His father, now dead, was for a long
time Minister to the Prussian court for
Mecklenburg-Schwerin. His mother, who
is still living, resides in Scbwerin with a
married daughter, and another of her
daughters, who is a lady in waiting to the
Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Schwerin,
was married to the late Russian General
yon Peters. Baron yon Tausch has numer
ous aristocratic connections and still has
powerful friends. It is recalled that it is
only six weeks since he received the dec
oration of the Red Eagle with the order of
the crown, which is always bestowed as a
special mark of imperial favor.
In the search for the men who are be
hind Tausch, the inspirer of his attacks
upon ex-Chancellor Caprivi, General Bron
sart yon Schellendorf, Baron Marschall yon
Bieberstein and others, the question arises,
Who recommended to the Emperor the
conferring of such distinction upon the
chief of the secret police?
Count Philip yon Eulenburg, the Ger
man Embassador to Austria, frankly
admits having procured him the Austrian
decoration which was conferred upon him
by Emperor Francis Joseph for the sole
reason of the valuable services on the
occasion of the Kaiser's visit to Abazzia,
but surmises based upon good grounds
trace the recommendation to the Kaiser
that Tausch be decorated with the Red
Eagle and the crown to somebody com
prised in the immediate entourage of the
Emperor.
Naturally the anti-Bismarckian press
suggests the probability that Prince Bis
marck and machinations informed
Tausch's attacks upon Count Caprivi,
Baron Marschall yon Bieberstein and
General Bronsart yon Schellendorf, but
the best-informed opinion wholly absolves
both the old Chancellor and his son, Count
Herbert Bismarck, from any connection
with the matter.
Major yon Tausch had numerous agents
throughout Germany, who were employed
in reporting to their chief what they
could learn and often what they did not
learn about the private life of prominent
personages, and the newspapers now re
call Prince Bismarck's saying, "These
scoundrels hnv? to lie in order to live."
Although Tausch is supposed to have
destroyed a large number of his docu
ments* before he was arrested a great
number of others are still in existence,
and these have been seized. From the
character of these papers it is safe to
assume that several high officials may be
required to clear themselves of serious
accusations.
Among the obnoxious stories of the
political police has been the concoction of
plots of an alarmist character. An in
stance of this is recalled in the Kaiser's
going to Thorin some time ago, where his
Majesty used menacing language to the
Poles. Major yon Tausch had preceded
the Kaiser to Thorin by several days, and
upon its arrival there guarded the Em
peror's train with his suite of escort police.
When the train was on its way back to
Berlin Tausch caused it to take nnex
pected detours from the mnin line, de
claring that he had discovered a conspir
acy against the Emperor's life, though
nobody now believes that any such plot
ever existed or that Tausch thought it did.
Regarding Baron yon Bieberstein, it
now seems as though he had secured a
lasting vindication, yet the Berlin Post in
its issue of to-day criticizes the trial of
Baron yon Luetzow and his fellow-de
fendants, and asserts that the question
will be raised in* the Landtag why the
Minister of Justice allowed the Marschall
to play the triple role of witness, counsel
and virtual conductor of the prosecution.
At a meeting of the Berlin Municipal
Council yesterday Herr Stadthagen, So
cialist, protested against a portion of the
taxes imposed upon the taxpayers of Ber
lin going to support such persons like
Tau3ch and Luetzow.
The Emperor and the imperial family
will leave Potsdam on December 28 and
reside in the Schloss in Berlin for two
months. After the close of the Berlin
season the Emperor and Empress will so
on a six weeks' yachting cruise in the
Mediterranean and other waters, visiting
Athens and Constantinople in March.
The Krupp syndicate is arranging to
purchase the Brazilian system of railways
and will pay therefor 300,000.000 marks.

NOW THEY DARE
SCORE THE DEAD
Rev. Brown and His Cousin
, Talk About Sarah
B. Cooper.
An Enmity Tbat Grew Out of the
Assault of the Pastor on
Ingersoll.
Audacity of the Disgraced Divine in
Commenting Upon the Career of
a Christian Woman.
CHICAGO, 111., Dec. 12.â "During all
the time that Dr. Brown was pastor of the
First Congregational Church in San Fran
cisco he was opposed by Mrs. Sarah B.
Cooper," said Rev. John T. Blanchard of
437 Leavitt street to-day. Rev. Mr. Blanch
ard is pastor of the Covenant Congrega
tional Church, on the West Side, and a
cousin of Rev. C. O. Brown, D.D., whose
sensational trials on charges brought by
â¢women of his congregation attracted uni
versal attention about a year ago. He
rises to defend Dr. Brown and deplores
the reopening of the discussion in which
his relative and brother-pastor was in
volved. In addition to this Mr. Blanchard
gives a reason for the enmity of Mrs.
CooDer, who with her daughter died from
gas asphylation in San Francisco yester
day morning.
â¢*' As all but willful enemies of Dr. Brown
know," continued Rev. Mr. Blanchard,
â¢'the accusations brought against him in
Ban Francisco were plain blackmail and
he was proved not guilty, both by the
civil courts and the ecclesiastical court
which sat on the case an entire month.
As to Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper, who was a
prominent member of his cnurch and be
came his opponent and accuser in the
trial. I can give you an explanation of the
Whole matter.
"Mrs. Cooper was a cousin of Colonel
Robert Ingersoll, and though opposed to
him in religious matters always main
tained a warm friendship with him. Be
fore Dr. Brown went to San Francisco he
was pastor of the First Congreg ational
Church in Dubuque, lowa. While there
he attacked Colonel Ingersoll and made
one of the best arguments against the
agnostic lecturer that has ever been pub
lished.
"Friends of Ingeraoll in Dubuque sent
him a copy of what had been said and he
made an answer to the sermon, but would
not come to Dubuque to debate with Dr.
Brown. The latter, however, preached
another sermon in rebuttal, and the whole
matter continued for some time. Mrs.
Cooper did not desire Dr. Brown for the
pastor of her church on that account. She
had no reason, of course, to oppose him at
the start, and ostensibly was his friend.
In reality, however, she was his enemy.
This sbe showed at the trial, though she
never gave any testimony ana had no real
evidence to give, but simply made a state
ment which was believed to be of a dam-
Bging character.
"As to Mattie Overman being reformed,
Ido not believe it. She reformed once be
fore and was taken into the home of Dr.
Brown by him and His wife. The result
was that she tried to blacken his repnta*
tion and ruin him, she being a member of
a party which went into a conspiracy
against him."
Rev. 0. 0. Brown lives at 980 West Polk
street. When seen to-day he declined to
say anything about Mrs. Cooper or her
daughter.
"It would be very much out of place,
after their death, to dig up an old story,"
Baidtoe. "I cherish no ill feeling against
them. Mrs. Cooper was a remarkable
woman and did great good in her work;
but she made the mistake of her life when
she attacked me. It caused her the loss of
nearly all her friends. I received letters
Jnst recently saying that the people who
were her best friends before that time had
forbidden her coming to their bouse, and
she was generally shunned."
SUICIDE OF AN ALLEGED PRINCESS
Claiming to Be the Niece of a Polish
Hero and Imagining Herself Rich,
Josephine Jeroski Dies in Squalor.
BROOKLYN, N. V., Dec 12.â Miss
Josephine Jeroski, an alleged Polish
princess and grand-niece of General
Pulaski, committed suicide in her dingy
little room, 44 Smith street, this city,
some time between last Wednesday and
this morning. Her death was discovered
through the arrival of a letter addressed
to her which the landlady, who had taken
it from the postman, was unable to deliver
because repeated knocks on Miss Jeroski's
room door brought no response. The door
of the room was burst open and she was
found dead on the bed, fully dressed with
an empty bottle at her side, 'which had
evidently contained laudanum. Neigh
bors and some charitable people had con
tributed to her wants, and she baa plenty
to eat and was cosy and warm in her small
room, but other events combined to make
her despondent.
Miss Jeroski frequently stated to those
With whom she had intercourse that the
United States Government had $2,000,000
belonging to her, and which had been
deposited with it by the Russian Govern
ment to satisfy a claim for damages made
by the descendants in America ot General
Pulaski, and that the United States was
trying to cheat her out of the money. She
was thought to be mentally unbalanced.
DIFFERENT IN ILLENOTS
Indiana* Hxmpliclty Ao( to Be Followed
in the Inaugural.
SPRINGFIELD, 111., Dec. 11.â The ex
ample set by Governor-elect Mount of In
diana in sternly interdicting any tomfool
ery at bis inaugural, and especially any
parade of the military or an inaugural
ball, will not be followed by the State Re
publican machine wmcti has charge of
the preparations of the inauguration of
Governor-elect Tanner early next month.
It has previously been given out Â»that the
inauguration was to be one of the most
brilliant and spectacular affairs in the
history of the capital, and members of the
executive committee say to-day that these
plans will be adhered to.
The military is to be brought from all
parts of the State, tne parade and in
augural exercises will be attended with
pomp ana ceremony; there will be fire
works at night and there is talk of a pri
vate banquet for the machine and its man
agement, at which the wine is to flow like
water. â¦
â¢'Governor-elect Mount's suggestion
that it is in bad taste to invest ii n augur a
t'ODB with pomp and ceremony when the
common people are struggling for a liveli
hood, may be all right in Indiana," said
one ot those concerned to-day, "but so far
as Illinois is concerned we propose to
celebrate the incoming of a Republican
successor to Governor Ahgeld with a
jollification only second to that which will
De witnessed in Washington on March 4
next."
Applications have already been made to
the railroads for special rates to the capi
tal, and an invasion of at least half a
million enthusiastic Republicans is looked
for.
CHICAGO POOLROOMS RAIDED.
Mad Scramble of Bettors to Escape, but
Over Three Hundred Prisoners
Are Taken.
CHICAGO, 111., Dec. 12.â Every open
poolroom in this city was raided by the
Dolice this alternoon and the number of
prisoners taken is larger than in any raid
made here in months. Warrants were
taken out for the thirteen poolrooms
which were recently opened here, but
only five were found open when the police
arrived. These were filled with patrons
and more than three hundred prisoners
were taken to the station. The keepers
were arrested uniier State warrants, while
the patrons will be arraigned as inmates.
Bail was quickly obtained, and within
three hours from the time ttie raid was
begun all of the prisoners had been re
leased. It is said that the managers will
refuse to clo?e their doers in order that a
test case may be mrfde.
They claim that they are not operating
in violation, although Chief Badenoch is
acting with the advice of the law depart
ment and says that he will raid the places
as fast as they are opened. Notification
had been given the managers to close, but
five ignored it.
The raid this afternoon was filled with
the usual incidents. Ten patrol wagons
were brought into servioe and nearly
twenty loads of prisoners were taken to
the station. At Powers & O'Brien's
place on Madison street the appearance
of the police caused intense excitement
and about thirty of the inmates escaped
while ttie officers were guarding the doors.
The poolroom- is on the second floor and
many escaped by means of the dummy
elevator through which drinks are sent
up from the saloon before the police dis
covered it. Many others escaped down
fire escapes and several ran past the po
lice in the doorways.
The other places raided were: Perry's,
119 Clark street; Leo Mainer's, 176 Clark
street; H. W. Williams', 98 Randolph
street, and Bud White's, 125 Dearborn
street.
Some claim that the poolrooms were
operated within the law. Instead of ac
cepting the bets the managers claim
they acted as agents only. The police,
however, are investigating and believe
that the telegram alleged to have been
sent to and from Milwaukee did not leave
this city. They expect to find ah instru
ment somewhere in Chicago which was
used to induce the people to believe that
the telegrams were sent abroad and the
place of agreement therefore was not
Chicago. They have so far, however, been
unsuccessful, and the managers claim that
the bets were actually consummated out
side of Chicago. On this ground they will
fight the case.
HOKE SMITH SAVES HER.
The Ex-Secretary of the Interior Success
fully Defends a Woman Accused
of Robbery.
ATLANTA, Ga., Dec. 12.â Ex-Secretary
Hoke Smith appeared in a magistrate's
court ac counsel ior Mrs. M."L. Henson,
who was charged by Dr. F. T. Powell with
robbing him of bis pocket book. The doc
tor stated that Mrs. Henson had visited
his office to get a prescription. As she
was leaving he asked her ii she would not
kiss him, and he declared that she did kiss
him and at the same time picked his
pockets, getting a purÃe that contained
$45. Tte defendant denied the statement
and asserted that she ran out of the office
when he became offensive. Mr. Smith in
vited the doctor, who weighs 225 pounds,
to show the Justice how the woman picked
his pockets. The dootor accepted the in
vitation, threw his arms about the neck
of the ex-Secretary and they hugged each
other tightly, but the doctor did not reach
Mr. Smith's hip pocket nor could the ex-
Secretary reach -.he doctor's gun pocket,
and the magistrate decided that it was
physically impossible for Mrs. Henson to
have robbed the physician, even if she
had hugged him, and dismissed her.
DARING BURGLAR CAUGHT.
But They Firtt Held as Pritoner* Some
of Their Purtuer*.
CORNING, Kanb., Dec. 12. â Deputy
Sheriff Charles Andrews and Cjty Marshal
Bensing of this place, re-enforced by a
posse of several hundred armed farmers
of the locality, succeeded in effecting the
capture of two burglars, wanted for safe
bio wins here.
When the officers- first attempted to ar
rest the men on the highway there were a
display ot revolvers and a retreat to the
timber. Two farm workers in a field next
tried to capture the men, but after a pre
tended surrender they made prisoners of
the farmers and compelled the owner of
the farm to drive all four to the bouse.
Here the farmers' bodies and that of an
infant which one of the robbers snatched
from a cradle were utilized as a protection
against the gathering host of men and
boys. The younger of the robbers became
separated from his companion and was
captured, while the other calmly ate a
supper he had ordered prepared, with the
three citizens and the baby as body-guard.
Then he surrendered.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1896.
TEDDY HALE WINS
THE GREAT RACE
Wonderful Pluck of the
Irish Lad in Breaking'
All Records.
Shatters -the Six-Day Mark by
Wheeling Nearly Two Thou
sand Miles.
Little Rice, the Wilkesbarre Boy,
Gains S cond Place by His Heroic
Perseverance
NEW YORK, N. V.. Dec. 12.â Twelve
thousand people saw Teddy Hale, the hero
of the six-day bicycle race at Manison
square Garden, cross the finish line to
night, a winner, with 1910 miles and eight
laps to his credit.
Hale broke all records from 101 miles
up, and shattered the six-day record by
310 miles and seven laps. He set an ex
ample of what can be accomplished by
pure grit and determination that will live
in the memories of the thousands who
shouted themselves hoarse in applauding
the pluck which prompted tho Irishman
to stay on and finish his task even after
nature herself had giyen out.
At ten minutes before the hour set for
ending the race only three of the fifteen
men who had literally plowed their way
since early morning in a semi-conscious
state were left on the track. One was the
winner and the others were Burns Pierce,
the Canadian, who bails from Boston, and
Orry Moore of Philadelphia.
Pierce and Moore were struggling slowly
along, but the boy from the Emerald
Island was bent over his bandio bars
sprinting for all he was worth. Again and
again the crowd burst forth into uncon
trollable enthusiasm which was absolutely
deafening when the hands of the garden
clock reached the hour of 10, and the
gieatest six-day bicycle race ever seen
was ended.
The band began to play the Irish
national air, but the music was drowned.
The pandemonium increased when Hale
wrapped him-elf in an American flag
which was thrown to him from one of the
boxes. The rest of the division having
secured their places by 9:30 o'clock had
retired. Some of them were physically
unable to continue, while others haa had
more than enough of tee strain, mentally
and bodily. Little Rice, the Wilkesbarre
boy, who ran into second place, made a
terrible effort to keep on.
but he had done more than enough to
show of what mettle he was made. When
Dame Nature refused to give him any more
support and he had to he helped to his
quarters, there was a reception accorded
him which in volume and sincerity was
but little behind the ovation accorded to
Hale. Never did mortal man persevere
under such circumstances as Rice did.
Poorly bandied and suffering from swollen
and bruised knees, which he received be
fore the start, he still kept on. Time after
time mind and body gave way, but game
ness came to the rescue and he resumed
the torture. His performance is even
more worthy of praisa than Hale's, be
cause Rice began the struggle behind
while Hale was battling in front. Rice
nobly lived up to his name of "forced
marches." Every one of the eleven placed
men beat the previous record as did also
Cassidy. The latter with Gannon, Mc-
Leod and Glick were each presented with
$100 as a voluntary gift on the part of the
management.
After the race Hale was tendered an of
fer of a banquet by representatives of a
prominent Irish society of this city. All
of the contestants were wean and scarcely
able to articulate, but with rest and care
ful handling will undoubtedly lose the ef
fects of the terrible strain of the past
week.
After the endurance contest was over
there was a twenty-five mile professional
scratch race, which was won by Jay Eaton.
Al Weining was second and Charles Car
ter third. Time, 1 hour 3 minutes and
35 3-5 seconds.
The winning score at 10 o'clock, 142
hours (the previous record, 1600 miles 1
lap, made by Schock) was:
Ed (Teddy) Hale, Ireland, winner, first
prize, $1300, 1910 miles 8 laps.
J. 8. Rice, Wilkesbarre, Pa., second
prize, $800, 1882 miles 6 laps.
Ned Reading, Omaha, Nebr., third prize,
$500, 1855 miles 3 laps.
Fred Forster, New York, fourth prize,
1829 miles 4 laps.
Albert Schock, New York, fifth prize,
1766 miles 2 laps.
Burns W. Pierce, Boston, sixth prize,
1758 miles 1 lap.
E. C. Smith, Saratoga, seventh prize,
1754 miles 7 laps.
"Major" Taylor, Brooklyn, eighth prize,
1732 miles 2 laps.
C. vV. Ashinger, Upshur, Ohio, ninth
prize, 1673 miles 3 laps.
E. C. Moore, Philadelphia, tenth prize,

CUTE COLLIS AT THE CAPITAL.
WASHINCTON, D. C, Dec. 12.â 0. P. Huntington arrived to-day from
New Yort and registered at the Normandie. He did not visit the Capitol, as
neither Senate nor House was in session. He received visits from several Con
gressmen, however. Mr. Huntington will remain here the entire session, re
turning to New York occasionally. Mr. Huntington is hopeful that the
Powers bill will pass this Congress. "He realizes that it is now or never,"
said a Coneressman who called on him to-night.
Judge Maguire has made a careful canvass of the Democratic side of the
House and Barham and Hilborn have been mingling with the Republicans.
Judge Maguire helieves that the refunding bill may be defeated in the House.
He says tbat the sentiment on the Democratic side is strongly opposed to the
measure, and that Hilborn and Barham report that they have interviewed
many Congressmen on the Republican side, who have announced their disap
proval of any refunding scheme. With all deference to the opinion of Judge
Maguire Barham, Hilborn and others who are making California's fight
against the Pacific railroads' refunding bill, it is the opinion of others equally
conversant with the situation that there never has been a time when the pros
pects for the bill's passage were so favorable as now. Senator Perkins shares
this belief.
WORK ON A TARIFF BILL
Ways and Means Committee Ready to
Begin Preparation of the
Measure.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 12.â Two
hours were spent at the Capitol to-day by
the members of the Ways and Means
Committee discussing the basis of a new
tariff bill and selecting the members who
shall study the different features of the
bill so that they may report from time to
time as experts. It was also decided that
the bill should be framed by the full com
mittee, and not built up from a series of
reports made by different sub-committees,
as bad formerly been the case.
While no definite date was assigned it
was understood in a general way that bard
work would be^in on Monday, the 28th
inst. It was also decided that a resolu
tion should be reported to the House for a
holiday adjournment from the 22d of De
cember until the sth of January.
In the division of labor the woolen
schedule will receive the particular atten
tion of the chairman, Dingley of Maine,
and associated with him will be Russell of
Connecticut, Grosvenor of Ohio and Dal
zell of Pennsylvania. GroÃvenor of Ohio
and Payne of New York will give their
attention to the sugar schedule which, it
is expected, will prove a source of consider
able embarrassment, owing to the diffi
culty of fixing a rate of duty which will be
satisfactory from a political and economic
standpoint.
Another feature of the bill â reciprocity
in trade with countries from whioh we
import certain articles that are produced
to little if any extent in the United States
âis expecten to be another stumbling
block, owing to the difficulty of securing
a suitable treaty with Brazil, from which
most of our coffee is purchased, and with
Spain for reciprocity in Cuban products.
The State Department has been advised
that Brazil is unwilling to revive the old
reciprocity treaty of 1890, and our strained
relations with Spain will, it is believed,
militate against a treaty with that coun
try. Venezuela refused to negotiate such
a treaty six years ago and it is not ex
pected that her position has been changed
during the interim.
The fuller consideration of this reci
procity question will be left principally to
Mr. Tawney of Minnesota and Mr. Hop
kins of Illinois, who, during the last ses
sion, prepared an exhaustive report on the
subject, showing how greatly the United
States had been benefited by the arrange
ment.
It was agreed that careful attention
should be given to the agricultural
schedule, and this schedule would be
largely in the hands of Dolliver of lowa,
Tawney of Minnesota, Johnson of North
Dakota and Steel of Indiana.
The internal revenue features of the
bill â liquor and tobacco â form the main
subjects which wijl be left with Evans of
Kentucky and Russell of Connecticut.
Cottons and silks will receive the attention
of Dingley ot Maine and Russell of Con
necticut. The iron and steel schedules
will receive the atteution of Dalzell of
Pennsylvania, in view of the large manu
factories of that product in his State, and
Tawney, in view of the fact that he repre
sents the great iron ore regions of Min
nesota.
No decision, not even of a tentative
character, was reached regarding the ad
ministrative law, which will probably be
prepared by the full committee. There
was no division of opinion regarding a
substitution of specific for ad valorem
rates. The general discussion of the sub
ject showed that it is the committee's
intention, as was stated in the United
Associated Presses yesterday, to frame a
conservative and by no means an extreme
measure. In no case will the rates in the
former McKinley law be exceeded, except
where, as a member expressed it this after
noon, this was done by the Democrats
"for good and sufficient rea?ons" when
the present tariff law was formed.
On the other hand a reduction in duty
will follow in each case where it is prac
ticable, keeping in mind only the neces
sity of protecting home industries with
such additions to the revenue as will pre
vent a deficit in the National treasury.
A full committee meeting, at which the
Democratic members will be present, has
been called for Monday next, at which
the purpose of the committee will be out
lined and a definite understanding reached
regarding the date when hearings will be
gin. It is intended that the bill shall be
completed not later than the Ist day of
March, in order that it may be reported to
the House the day that the extra session
begins.
EX-QUEEN ULIUOKALANI'S VISIT.
Its Object Is to Obtain From This Govern-
ment a Demand for Indemnity
From Dole's Crowd.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 12.â Ctesar
Celso Moreno, once prominent in Ha
waiian politics, has received a letter from
one of the leaders in the late revolt from
which Queen Liliuokaliani was arrested
and imprisoned. This letter throws some
light on the Queen's visit to America. It
speaks of the robbery of the cro *â¢Â» lands
which were hers by right and which
would have given her competence. The
Dole Government usurped her pension,
which was given, says the letter, on the
pretended promise of intervention by
President Cleveland in Hawaiian affairs.
The apparent purpose of this visit of the
ex-Queen, as disclosed in the letter, is to
demand indemnity ior the loss of the
crown lands, as well as her regal author
ity, which, it is claimed, were taken away
by a revolutionary movement instigated
by the United States Consul and aided by
United States marines from the cruiser
Boston.
JSLBCTHOCUTIoy OF 01P3T.
Refusal of the Chief of Police to Permit
a Public Affair.
CHICAGO, 111., Dec. 12.â Chief of Po
lice Badenoch to-day refused to recom
mend to the City Collector that a permit
be issued to publicly electrocute the man
killing elephant Gypsy, and unless Mayor
Swift, who is out of the city, takes favor
able action, the beast will not be killed as
a show to pay the expenses of his de
parture from nfe. W. H. Harris, the
owner, is in a quandary as to what to do
with the monster, who is so dangerous
that he is kept in solitary confinement and
no one dares to venture within reach of
his trunk. Chief Badenoch bases his re
fusal because no assurance is given that
the animal would not break away before
being killed and cause a fatal panic among
the people.
Trouble* of Tatteraall:
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 12.â 1t is said

SITE FOR SAN JOSE'S SCHOOL
The Board of Education Petitions for a
Portion of the State Normal
Grounds.
SAN JOSE. Cal., Dec. 12.â A meeting
of the City Board of Education was held
this morning to discuss the matter of se
curing a part of the lands occupied by the
State Normal School as a site for the new
High School building. The following
resolution was adopted and will be for
warded to Governor Budd:
Resolved, That tt be the unanimous sense of
the Board of Education of the city of San Jose
that the proposed High School building should
be located on the State Normal School grounds :
that the Board of Education snouid use all
honorable means to secure from the State of
California and the truitees of the State Nor
mal School a portion of said Normal Schoo
grounds for the abova purpose; that if a porl
tlon can be secured that the Board oi Educa
tion pledges itself to keep said plat of ground,
other than the portion occupied by the build
ing. in lawn and shrubbery aud in as good
condition as other portions of said park.
The Normal Bquare occupies twenty
eight acres, and, as but very little of it
ii used for school purposes, it is thought
that the State will readily deed to the
city a portion. The property was given
to the State for school purposes. An issue
of $75,000 in bonds has already been voted
for the school building.
It is said that Governor Budd is in favor
of granting the city the land desired. The
local representatives in the Leeislatura
will introduce a bill favoring such action
at the coming session.

Monday evening. The joint committee
from the Hundred Thousand Club and
the Chamber of Commerce, which has
promoted the fair, has practically finished
its labors and the arranging of displays
has been in active progress for the past
few days. The horticulturists throughout
the valley are taking an active interest in
the fair and there is spirited rivalry for
the prizes. This has been particularly de
veloped among the counties, and the one
making the best display will be awarded a
substantial premium.
The fair has been projected on an elabo
rate scale. There is every indication that
it will be a great success and that many
visitors will be attracted from all parts of
the State. The weather bids fair to be fa
vorable.

TRIES TO KILL A
CONSUL-GENERAL
Fury of a German Who
Goes Gunning for August
Feigel.
Wild Scramble and a Flight
Among the New York Con
sulate Attaches.
Upon Being Disarmed and Arrested
the Would-Be Assassin Recites
Alleged Wrongs.
NEW YORK. N. V., Dec. 12.â A man
made a futile attempt to kill the German
Consul-General, August Feigel, at the
consulate, 2 Bowling Green, at 11 o'clock
to-day. The man appeared at the con
sulate at 10 :30 and asked to see the Con
sul, and when told that he could not see
him went away. He returned half an
hour later and was again denied admit
tance.
He thereupon pushed his way through
a swinging door at the counter and at
tempted to get into the private office of
the Consul-General. One of the clerKs
stopped him. Then the man drew a re
volver, fully loaded, from his overcoat
pocket, just as Consul-General Feigel ap
peared at the door. Uttering a curse in
German, the man leveled the pistol at the
head of the Consul-General.
Paul Falcke, the Vice- Consul, jumped
toward the man, grabbed him by the
shoulders and in the scrimmage the
revolver fell to the floor.
The man fought like a madman to re
gain the pistol and finally succeeded.
Then everybody save the infuriated man
fled. A policeman was summoned and,
knocking the revolver from the man's
hand, and after freely using kis club suc
ceeded in reaching the Church-street sta
tion with his prisoner.
Later the man was arraigned before
Magistrate Flammer in the Center-street
Police Court. There he said his name was
Ludwig Schutte, a dairyman by occupa
tion, and that he arrived in America from
Hamburg on November 30. Schutte then
told a rambling story of having been
robbed of his money and alleged German
official persecution, which he thought had
followed him to this country. This was
his only reason for his endeavor to kill
the Consul. He was committed until to
morrow for examination.
Rain at Santa Cruz.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Dec. 12.â Rain
fell last evening, following a cold south
wind. At midnight there was a heavy
â bower, which, by daylight this morning,
had been reduced to a heavy mist.
OTSW TO-PAT:
Very often Nature needs only a little
help to get : over an obstruction. When
a boom of logs is floating down a river,
all goes well until one single log strikes
something and sticks. Then there's a
"jam" â and trouble. It is just so in |
the progress jof food through the diges-
tive organs. 'Everything goes well till
something sticks. Then the process of
digestion stops. ! That's indigestion. Un-
less the impediment is removed, poison-
ous putrid matter begins to accumulate.
There's a "jam" â constipation, : and
trouble. Sick -headache, biliousness,
sleeplessness, vertigo, heartburn, loss of
appetiteâ these are some of the symp-
toms. Just a little help at the appear-
ance of the first one would end the
trouble. 'â  Nature is \ a hard worker, but
she needs assistance if too much be put
upon her. : â 
Dr. Pierces Pleasant Pellets offer the
best and simplest method for furnishing
this assistance. ' They are prompt and
very effective - in their action, but they
are not strong nor severe. They cause
no violent wrench of the system. They
go right to the "log" that is fast and
loosen it. Nature does the rest. ;By and
by, with a little care in dieting, Nature
will do it all. That's one great advant-
age of the ," Pleasant Pellets ' over the
many strongly cathartic pills â you do
not become a slave to their use. They
really cure the trouble they are . meant
to cure. Even the worst kind of chronic
constipation disappears with their, use.
'i CAUTION.â Some designing dealers do not
permit their customers to have Dr. Pierces Pel-
lets because inferior pills afford greater profits.
Such dealers are short sighted. They overlook
the fact that next time you will go where yon
are supplied with what you ask for. '

DIES AT IIPI
The Final Summons Comes
Suddenly to the Aged
Jurist.
Arouses His Wife at Night and
Tells Her That His Race
Is Run.
Passing of a Man Who Balanced the
Scales of Justice With Im
partial Hand.
NAPA, Cal., Dec. 12.â Judge G. W.
Towle, one of the men who assisted in
blazing the way to a better civilization
â¢ during California's pioneer days, died
suddenly at his home in this city last
night. The news of the aged jurist's pass- ;
â ing came as a shock to the community,
for last evening he was seen upon the :
streets, apparently in his usual health.
Judge Towle retired last evening as [
usual. About 11 o'clock he called to his
wife and complained of suffering some !
pain. He said his lunzs were filling and 'â 
a few moment- later he gave his loved I
companion to understand that the end |
was at hand. Before a physician could j
reach his bedside he was dead.
A man oi spotless character and unsul- i
lied life, one whose stalwart frame had i
for years been yielding to the infirmities i
that usually come to those who have
passed the three score and ten limit, has
thus been called from the activities of
life to his final rest. Few men in the |
community had been more often honored j
by their fellows:
Able in the expounding of the law, he !
was just and impartial in demanding its ;
enforcement, and for this reason was ]
Many times called to the chair of justice. I
He was first appointed Justice of the i
Peace of Napa County by the Supervisors j
on November 13, 1857. He was elected
District . Attorney in 1869, served one
rtn and was appointed County Judge to I
nil the vacancy occasioned by the death
of Judge Jacks on September 5, 1863.
Judge Crouch succeeded him on. the |
bench in 1875. He was made City Attor- j
ney and served in that capacity eiÂ«:ht
years, conducting in the meantime im- i
portant cases involving large municipal |
interests. Of late years the Judge had
filled the office , of Court Commissioner, i
under appointment of Judge Ham. He j
had also been attorney for Mrs. Â£. B.
Hartson in the management of her large j
estate, and had papers in his pocket j
which were perfected yesterday prepara
' tory to pushing a suit for his client in San :
Francisco to-day.
â  Judge Towle was born in Avon, Me., on j
October 6, 1823. He came to California in
1349 and engaged in mining. Later he set- j
tied in Napa and entered upon the prac- '
tice of law. He was a man of command- \
ing presence, but of a quiet and retiring j
disposition. He was never in court unless j
he had business there, was constant in at- â 
tendance upon official duties and when he j '
sought recreation it was in nature's wilds I
with ro*d aid gen. H* was a man of |
strong conviction!", loved his country in- I
tensely and mourned the defeats and re- j
joiced in the victories of the Republican i
party, to which he gave life-long alle
giance.
Judge Towle is survived by a widow, one !
daughter, Mrs. .H. A. Pellet, and a j
nephew. George M. Towle of San Fran- j
Cisco. The funeral will be held to-morrow |
at 3:301 o'clock from the family residence
on Oak street.

Santa. Cru* Damage Suit Deddnd.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Dec. 12.â The case
of Scnvani vs. Dondero, for damages,
which ha-* been on trial in the Superior
Court for the last three weeks, resulted in
a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of
$1000 and cos 8. About two years ago,

SONOMA COUNTY
WINS ITS SUIT
Judge Dougherty Decides
Against Ex- Treasurer
Stofen.
Must Repay Money Alleged to
Have Been Stolen by an
Outlaw.
Sequel to the Sensational Robbery of
the Courthouse Vau't at
Santa Rosa.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Dec. 12.â Judge
Dougherty of the Superior Court to-day
rendered a decision in favor of the plaint
iff in the case of Sonoma County vs. P.
N. Stofen and his bondsmen. The action
was brought to recover $SOOO of county
money, alleged to have converted by
Stolen to his own use while serving as
Treasurer of Sonoma County.
It will be remembered that Captain
Slofen was found locked in the vault of
the Treasurer's office one afternoon in De
cember, 1894, and a tray containing $8000
was missing. When released be told how
a tall robber with a club and knife bad
met him at the door of the vault as he
was emerging with the tray of gold and
after niching the county funds had iocked
him in the vault.
The court holds that while robbery is a
good defense, according to a late decision
of the Supreme Court, tbe burden of proof
is upon tbe defendant to prove the rob
bery and this lie has faied to do. The
bondsmen of Captain Stofen were H.
Doyle, A. P. Overton, J. H. Brush, Con
Shea and the late Hollia Hitchcock, a
quintetof Sonoma' s wealthiest men, and it
is quite probable that the legal battle will
be contiuued.
STOCKTON STABBING AFFRAY.
Too Much Liquor Responsible for a
Conflict Between Erstwhile
Friends.
STOCKTON, Cal,, Dec. 12.â The Sunny
South Saloon, just outside the city limits,
was the scene of a knifing affray early last
evening. Morgan W T hite inflicted three
gashes upon a young fellow named Ed
Harding. The two had been friends De
fore the trouble and had been drinking to
gether. The elixir they imbibed seemed
to put Harding in an exuberant mood,
while it had a morose effect upon White.
Harding, for a prank, threw some beer
on White and the latter told him not to
do it again. Notwithstanding the admon
ition the other repeated the beer-throw
ing and White whipped out a pocket
knife and thrice stabbed him.
Harding did not know that he had bee n
stabbed for a few minutes, and when he
did find it out he, together with two
friends, started after White, who had fled
from the pi a^e. The wound d man had
gone but a short distance when the loss of
blood told on him and he had to give up
the* chase. Of the wounds infl.cted one is
quite dangerous, but not faral. It is an
incision in the back, just over the right
kidney. The full length of the blade pene
trated the flesh.
STOCKTON PHYSICIAN PUZZLED.
Witnessed the Seeming Death of a' Baby
and Its Unexpected Revival
Later.
STOCKTC-N, Cal., Dec. 12.â According
to Dr. A. L. Foreman of this city he yes
terday met with a peculiar case wherein
it seemed to him the dead came to life.
The physician says that at about 10:30
o'clock yesterday he was called to the
Gnekow block to attend an infant girl,
not quite four weeks old, whose mother
had given it an overdose of paregoric at 10
o'clock the preceding night. It was still
asleep when the doctor arrived and
despite all he could do to counteract tue
â oporiric it sank lower and lower.
Shortly after 2 o'clock iv the afternoon
the doctor bad a priest called hastily, as
tne babe was apparently breathing its
last. The father came, and while he was
there death seemed to have ended the lit
tle one's suffering?. Ths physician closed
its eyej an>l lips, and they remained closed
for some time.
To the surprise of those at the bedside
the baby suddenly began to move and
opened its eyes. It grew rapidly better
and to-day it was nursing as vigorously as
ever. The father of the babe is Robert
Drewry, an employe in Hale <fc Co. 'a store.

HOMING PIGEONS.
Two Birds That Have Kstabliihed
Records.
The two homing pigeons illustrated

pigeons owned by John Welch and John
Filmer of this City. Welch's birds were

imported from Antwerp, and are from
very old stock. The male is a record
breaker, having flown from Rome to
Antwerp (a distance of 800 miles) Irom 5
A. m. Monday until 12 m. Tuesday. This
fly has never been equaled. Filmer's pair
of homers, though not as high bred, per
haps, as the Welch birds, are far above the
average. The strain originally belonged
to Breeder J. M. Wriebtof Brighton, Ene
land. Fast French Government stock has
since been inbred, and to-day Wright's
Anglo-Franco homer.-, stand pre-eminent.
The male of this pair h also a record
breaker. He flew from Brandenburg on
tbe river Havre, between Magdeburg and
Berlin, Germany, just GOO miles, to the
lufi. in Brighton, England, in 11 hours and
13 minntes. This fly was against a stiff
gale. Yet the bird beat all his previous
and others' times from the same place oy
36 minutes. There are better birds than
these, but they aro not found on the
Pacific Coast.
LIVERPOOL'S GREAT FIRE.
It Cost Â»Hrly Forty Human Lives
Ihrough a Mad i'auic.
A terrible disaster, causing the loss of
nearly forty Jives, happened on October 11,
1878, at Liverpool, through a sudden panic
aud crush occurring in a crowded music
hall, the Colosseum, in Paradise street,
which was nightly thronged with a com
pany of the poorer classes listening to a
musical performance. About 8:20, as
Fred Coyne was singing a comic song, a
tight took place Jn the corner of the pit
under the gallery. Ti s disturbance in
creased, and those taking part in it could
not be seen from every part of the house.
Some one raised the cry of "Firel" A
great stampede ensued, and a rush was
made to the doors, and in a few minutes
large numbers of people were trampled
under foot, being unable to escape from
the building, tbe doors of which seem at
first to have been closed. There were no
less than six available exists, but the
frightened audience rushed to the one
leading into Paradise street. Aa the free
passage of tbe people there was inter
fered with by an upright in the center I
of the doorway, there was a complete
blocK. Hundreds rushed down from the
gallery, others slid down the pillars on
the heads of those in the pit. The police,
seeing the shrieking crowd trying to
emerge from the buildinjr, endeavored to
persuade them to hold back, but ia vain;
the loss of life would have been greater
had not a policeman cut down a partition
with an ax and thus enlarged the exit.
At lengtn order was restored, and the
people gradually made their way out the
main door, as well as by the other exits;
but the panic, however, though brief in
duration, had done its worst ; in a few min
utes thirty-seven dead and numbers of in
jured persons were carried into the street.
Few bore marks of outward injury, but
their torn clothing showed how severe
had been the struggle; death has resulted
from suffocation. As iast as possible the
injured were placed in cabs and taken to
the Royal Infirmary, amid a scene of preat
excitement. The fire engine and escape
arrived and the firemen, joining with the
police, entered the building to reassure
tne people. The performance was, of
course, stopped, and the building taken
possession of by the police. â Spare Mo

TIPPING GENERAL-SHERID AN.
One of the Many Amusing Stories That
Were Edited Out of His Book.
"General Sheridan had a great deal
more of his memoirs written than ever got
into his book," said a gentleman who was
for a long time officially connected with
the lata general of the army. "Hud he
lived the bouk would have been much
livelier, I assure you. As it waÃf the
memoirs were edited by Coionel Stieridan,
Uenerul Sheridan's brother, after his
death, and many of the best things, in my
judgment at least, were for various rea
sons left out. General Sheridan was very
anxious to tell some of tue lunny experi
ences he had after he reached the com
mand of the army, and he had outlined
several of t em just prior to the illness
wnich ended m uts death.
"One of these experiences referred to
the first tip that he received for being
pleasant to a visitor. In the guidebooks
there is a description of the office oi the
general, or, as it is known, the headquar
ters of the army In tbe War Department.
It is stated in connection therewith that
;ne office is generally open for public in
spection, and thai, visitors to the city and
others are welcome to inspect it at all
times, at least during office nours. Once
General Sheridan was very busy prepar
ing or revising some official reports. He
htiii kept the messengers generally sta
tioned at the outer door of his office run
ning around at a rather lively rate to his
various subordinates, and for tiie moment
there was no one at the door, when in
marched a couple of visitors, a respect*
able-looking man and a lady, armed with
their guidebook. The general did not
relish the intrusion very much, but they
did not know it, for he kept steadily at his
work.
"They examined all the pictures on the
walls and gave considerable attention to
a marble bust of the general, which had
just been placed therein, 'so that is Gen
eral Fhii Sberiaan,' said the man to his
wife. 'Well, no one wou.d ever think
tnat man was ever such a fighter as he
was. To me he looks a little top-heavyâ
has too much head for his body.' He
made other remark-*, all of wh.ch the
general heard, and ihe effect of them was
to divert his attention from his work.
'How old is Sheridan?' asked the visitor,
indicating for the first time that he no
ticed any one in the room. General Sheri
dan gave him tiie information, and,
thinking that the best way to ci rid of
n is visitors would be to explain to them
hurne-.ily the things of interest in the
room, proceeded to do so. He warmed up
somewhat on some ot them, and his de
scriptions and exjlanations of some of
the portraits, Â»ar scenes and Indian
curios. blanKets, etc. â there were a num
ber of them then in the roomâ were ex
tremely interesting.
â¢The yisitors were appieciative, how
ever, and, as they turned to leave the
room, the man quietly slipped a 25-cent
piece into the general's hand, adding that
they were tbantful for the information
and instruction, and departed. The story
was such a good one that the general told
it on himself, first to his messengers and
afterward to many others. He had in
tended to run it into his memoirs, but it
never eot there. He always spoice of it as
the first time he had received and accepted
a fee for performing a public service." â

LINCOLN TREE BLOWN DOWN.
It Was Planted by th* Great President
Thirty- Five Years Ago.
'One of tbe sad features of the storm,"
said one of the White House gardeners,
as he was engaged in trimming up the
trees, "was the destruction of the_ Lin
coln tree, which stood nearest the steps
leading from the War, State and Navy
departments to the executive mansion.
It was the end tree of a row, nearly all of
which have been planted by Presidents.
The Lincoln tree was planted a few
months after President Lincoln entered
the White House, and it soon was larger
than other trees many years older.
"ItwasikS size that brought about its
destruction now, for it was tbe only one
in the Presidents' row which was blown
down, though there was sad havoc with
the other trees. There were a number of
persons who asked for limbs of the tree,
and as far as we could we ohliged them.
Though ma^le does not make a good cane,
a number of those who secured limbs said
they intended having canes made for pre
sentation to those who would cherish a
souvenir from Washington, and especially
a cane from the tree planted by Lincoln
himself.
"I have been in the gardens off and on
since Lincoln's days, and I am sure there
was more damage aone by the storm to
tbe trees there that one night than in all
of the thirty-one years combined. We
will keep the stump of the tree, and may
be in lime, for it is strongly rooted, it will
branch out again. In the meantime we
will grow Japanese ivy on tbe trunk." â

DEATH OF MRS,
ANNIE DONAHUE
The Widow of the Million
aire Railroad Builder
No More.
A Surprise to Her Friends
Though She Had Been 111
Over a Year.
Left a Large Estate Consisting of Rea.
Property and StocksâCharita
ble and a Sccial Leader.
Mrs. Annie Donahue, wife of the late
millionaire, Peter Donahue, the iron
founder aud builder of the Donahue Rail
road, died at 8:30 o'clock last night after
an illness which had extended over a year.
Nevertheless, her death was a surprise,
for at different periods she so much im
proved that her complete recovery was
anticipated. A new and handsome resi
dence bad been constructed on Pacific
avenue, where bhe expected to dwell per
manently. To this end the furniture and
fixtures of the old mansion at the north
east corner of Bryant and Second streets
had been advertised to be sold at auction
to-morrow*
The funeral will take place from St.
Mary's Cathedral on Tuesday, but tbe hour
is not yet announced. Mrs. Donahue was
the sister of the late ex-Governor John G.
Downey, Mrs. Eleanor Martin of this City
aud Miss Winifred Martin of Baltimore,
and was the stepmother of Baroness yon
Schroeder and the late J. Merryn Dona
hue. J. Downey Harvey and Peter, Wal
ter and Andrew Martin, the latter three
sons of Mrs. Eleanor Martin, are her
nephews.
Mrs. Donahue was 60 years of age and
was a native of Roscommon, Ireland. She
was married to Peter Donahue in 1864. In
November, 1885, Mr. Donahue died, leav
ing an estate worth many millions. He
had begun life as a blacksmith, and ac
quired his wealth witb remarkable rap
idity, The estate consisted of the Dona
hue, or Ban Francisco and North Pacific
Railroad, bonds, stocks, ranches, and a
large amount of very valuable City prop
erty.
This property was afterward divided,
J. Mervyn Donahue and tbe Baroness yon
Schroeder receiving their share. A large
estate, worth up in the millions, was left
to Mrt. Donahue. She has been yery
charitable, giving with a free hand to
entireties and public institutions. She
gave i er half-interest in the property on
Montgomery street, near Sacramento,
formerly the offices of the Donahue rail
road, to Bishop Riordan for a seminary
lor the education of priests. She was also
one of the earliest subscribers to the Val
ley Railroad.
J. Downey Harvey said last night that
the property left by her was large.
"There is the Union foundry," he said,
"and she was one of the largest owners in
the First National Bank. She owned the
Columbia building, on Market street, and
was a heavy owner in the North American
Company, had the residence properties on
Bryant street and on Pacific avenue, and
owned a great deal of other property."
Besides being prominent in private and
public charities she was for years very
conspicuous in society. When Governor
Downey, her brother, occupied the Ex
ecutive office at Sacramento she was the
mistres sof tbe Executive mansion and
was the leader in all social events. John
T. Doyl* has for a good while been the
manager of her estate.

NEW STEAMER FOR
THE VALLEJO ROUTE
Purchased by the Piper-
Aden- Goodall Company
Yesterday.
She Will Alternate With the
Sunol in the Opposition
Line.
Two Vessels That Are Long Overdue
Have Been Heavily Reinsured
by the Underwriters.
The members of the Piper-Aden-Good
all Company are jubilant. They have out
witted the Southern Pacific, and in conse
quence General Manager Pryor of the op
position is more than pleased. The rail
road has the call on almost every stern
wbeel steamer in the bay and not one of
them can be chartered without the con
sent of Agent White of the Southern
Pacific. In consequence, competition
where this class of vessel is concerned has
been greatly handicapped.
Latterly the Monticello, Herald and
Sunol have been running to Vallejo and
Mare Island. The Sunol has been carry
ing nearly all the passengers and the Her
ald (the N. P. boat) has been losing
money at the rate of $50 a day. On sev
eral occasions the Monticello has been
hauled off for temporary repairs and a
tue had to be put 'on the run, as no suit
able noat could be secured. A few days*
ago it was found necessary to overhaul
the Sunol. and the company at once be
fan looking for a vessel to take her place,
t was then that Manager Pryor discov
erea 'that almost every stern-wheeler in
the bay had been pre-empted. The Grace
Barton, tied up in Oakland Creek, was for
>ale, however, and the farm at once paid a
deposit on her.
Yesterday the barcain was consum
mated, and in future the stern-wheeler
will fly the house flap of the Piper- Aden-
Goodall Company. The new boat came
over from Oakland Creek yesterday, and
next Tuesday the Sunoi will go on the
ways ior an overhauling. When she is
repaired the company's steamer Hope
â rill be repaired, and me Sunol will make
the daily run to Berkeley. When both
steamers are again in good running order
the Grace Barton will be tied up to await
an emergency. The opposition now has
the htugn on the railroad.
Captain R. Robertson, the well-koown
â¢hip-owner, has purchased the slood
Witch of the Bay. He will turn her into
a yacht, and when completed she will be
the handsomest craft in her class on the
bay. She draws 2 feet 6 inches forward
and 3 feet alt, and is therefore is a good
boat to cruise in through the sloughs.
Captain Robertson says he can run up in
theÂ«mud at night and have no difficulty
in getting her off next morning. The
Witch of the Bay will be entered in all
this year's regattas, and her owner ex
pects to carry off several champion fla^s.
Captain Swan of the baik Theobald is
once again in town. He brought down a
load of the North Paciric Mining and
Transportation Company's coal from Coal
Harbor, and asserts that the place in the
near future will be a great coal center.
Next season a steamer is to be put on the
route, and Juueau, Sltka, Wrangel and
other Alaskan ports wnl all be supplied
from this point. The Theobald's cargo
has already been sold, but another load
will not come to this port before next
summer.
The British ship Clan Galbraith and the
German ship C. fi. Watjen had an inter
esting race irom Swansea to San Fran
cisco. Both vessels left on the same day,
but the Galbraith managed to beat her
rival into port by twelve hours. They
spoke each other off t c Horn and were in
company near the Farallones. A favorable
wind carried the Englisii ship up near the
tug Active and she was towed in. Twelve
hours later the German ship was picked
up by the tug Reliance and af'.er being
towed in came to an anchor near her rival.
Both are very handsome ships, but neither
of them made a record on the run that can
be "bragged about."
Shipping and insurance men are won
dering what has become of the British
shin Anglesey and the American four
masted schooner E. K. Wood. The for
mer is now out ninety-nine days from
Newcastle, N. S. W., and 15 per cent re
insurance has been paid on her. ('.. ptain
Lewis is known all over the world as a
careful and skilhul navigator.but then the
underwriters are not losing sight of the
fact that the vessel is loaded with the
same class of coal that ;.rouj;bt two ves
sels into this port on fire. The Anglesey
left here two years ago for Deiauoa Bay,
and from there went in ballast to Austra
lia to load coal for San Francisco. She
was chartered to load wheat for England,
but tne charter party expired last week.
The E. K. Wood was from Pu^ret Sound
for 'Tientsin, China, with a load of lum
ber and is now 137 days out. Captain
Hanson was in command, and he bad a
crew of ten men, all ol whom hailed irom
San Francisco.
A lew days ago a sailing vessel arrived
from China ana the captain reported pass
ing through a lot of lumber. He described
it to Captain James Taft, managing owner
of the Wood, and he at once came to the
conclusion that the mark; and numbers
tallied with the deckioad of a schooner.
The chances are that if she is gone the
vessel was caught in a typhoon and went
down with ail bands. Fifty per cent re
insurance is offered, but there are no
takers.
The captain of the C. H. Watjen, al
though beaten by the Clan Galbraith in
the race from Swansea, made a record for
his sliip. The vessel was logging nine
knots an hour when the cry came, ''A
man overboard!" Julius Brunning had
fallen from the royal yard into the ocean
and in the distance he could be seen
swimming after the ship. The big ship
was put about, a boat lowered and in fif
teen minutes Brunning wa: aboard again,
wet through but ready for the horn of old
Schnapps that the captain offered him.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1896.
The Stern-Wheel Steamer Grace Barton That the Piper, Aden, Goodall Company Purchased Yes
terday to Alternate With the Sunol on the Vallejo Run. As the Southern Pacific Had
an Option on Almost Every River Steamer Owned in San Francisco, the Company
Was Compelled to Buy in Order to Have a Second Boat in an Emergency.
A NEW SCHEME
TO RAISE MONEY
Robert Long Plays the
Role of a Government
Detective.
He Accuses a -a loon- Keeper of
Passing Counterfeit
N ckels.
Offers to Square the Case on Payment
of $300 and Is Arrested on
Two Charges-
Robert Long was, until recently, in the
fruit business, and the chances are that he
will have cause to bitterly regret that he
did not continue to make an honest living
at it.
He is a man about 38 years of age, with
dark mustache and short side whiskers.
He was poorly dressed, but has a pleasant
and confiding way of talking.
Yesterday morning he called at the
Elite saloon, 611 Mission street, and or
dered a glass of rum and gum from W. J.
Carpmiii, one of the proprietors of the
saloon, who was behind the bar. There
was another customer in the saloon, ana
as soon as he left Long handed Carpmiii
a piece of paper, on which was written in
pencil: "We caught your nickel man,
Johnson, at ne was skipping on the Oak
land boat. What time can you give me
an interview?" The note was wriiten on
a piece of paper bearing at its head the
designation, "Office of Assistant Treas
urer, U. S."
Carponll was astonished and asked Long
what he meant. Long whispered some
tiling to him across the bar, but as Caru
mill could not catch what be said he
stepped from behind the bar and came
close up to Long. Then Long handed
him another note, written in pencil on
pacer headed, "Brooklyn Hotel." This
note read : "We caugnt your nickel man
as he was skipping on me Oakland boat
this inorning. You know what thut
means with the evidence I have against
you."
Carpmiii was alarmed and insisted upon
an explanation. Long said he was a gov
ernment detective and was after men who
were passing counterfeit nickles. He had
been informed that counterfeit uickles had
been passed in the Elite Saloon, and he
wanted possession of all the nickels that
were in the till. Carpmiii denied passing
any counterfeits and said if any had come
from his saloon they had been given in by
customers.
Long insisted upon getting all the
nickels and Carpmiii, believing that he
was a detective, emptied the till and gave
him twelve or thirteen, all new ones.
Long put the coins in an envelope, which
he sealed and marked as an exhibit. He
then told Carpmiii that he wonld return
and arrest him.
Just as he was leaving the saloon Lone
turned and said to Carpmiii, who had fol
lowed him: "I don't want to be too hard
on you. Now if you will pay me $300 1
will destroy thejnickels and say nothing
more about it. 1 have done the same
thing in other cases, so you can think
over my proposal and lev me know when I
return to arrest you." Then he walked
away.
When Car r mill's partner, J. W. Thomp
son, came to the saloon Carpmiii told him
of Long's visit and what he had done and
offered to do. Thompson was as much
surprised aa Carpmiii, and asked him,
"Did you make the detective show his
star?"
"I never thought of it," replied Carp
mill.
"That's the first thing I would have
done," said Thompson. "I believe he is a
fraud."
Long returned wh'ie the two were in
the saloon and Thompson immediately
asked him to show his star. Long replied
that he was in the secret service and did
not need a star. Thompson denounced
him as a swindler and told Carpmiii to
keep an eye upon him till he went for a
policeman.
As soon as Thompson left Long ran out
of the saloon and carpmiii pursued him.
He overtook him on Second street and
held him till Policeman J. F. Murphy ap
peared. Long was taken to police head
quarters and thoroughly searched. About
$2 in silver were found in his pocket and
lour new nickels, which Carpmiii identi
fied as part of the lot he gave Long in the
morning.
Long was taken to the City Prison and
charges of impersonating an officer and
obtaining money by false pretense* were
booked against him.
Long did not deny being in the saloon,
but denied representing himself as a de
tective ana getting the nickels. He said
he has a wife and family, but refused to
te 1 where they lived His papers would
indicate that he either lived in San Rafael
or Peialuma.
MASTEE MARINERS' BALL.
Jolly Jack Tan and Their Fricndg,
i.iijoy Themselves.
The Master Mariners' Benevolent Asso
ciation last evening gave a ball at Califor
nia Hall, which was tastefully decorated
for the occasion. The affair was a success.

J. J. Haviside, M. Olsen, V D. Cook, John

THIRTY-THISD MURDER TRIAL.
Carroll Cook Scores That Number With
the Jackson Cane and No Hanging.
The cas^ of Arthur Jackson, charged
with the murder ot August Florentine, in
which the jury failed to agree, was called
in Judge Belc er's court yesterday morn
ing for further proceedings.
It was ordered that the matter be post
poned until next Saturday, the 19th inst.,
at which time it is expected that the date
of the next trial will be faxed. In view of
the importance of the case it is not con
sidered practical to pet through with an
other trial before Ibe close of the present
year, and as Judge Belcher is to take up
civil cases, beginning next month, the
case will naturally go to some other de
rartment.
Attorney Carroll Cook, principal coun
sel for the defense, will ascend the
Superior Court bench on the first Monday
of January, and as he will be disqualified
to try Jackson because of his connection
with tne case, the trial will fall to Judge
Wallace or to Frank H. Dunne, who is
also to be installed as Superior Court
Judge in January and who is to take up
one of the criminal calendars. This is the
usual rule, it being understood that the
Judges last elected snail begin their judi
cial work with oriminal cases. Judge
Wallace is a voluntary exception to this
rule, bis calendar being a mixture of civil
and criminal business, the criminal pre
dominating, but in no case including di
vorce matters.
Jackson has expressed regret that the
election of Carroll Cook to the bench will
deprive him of that gentleman's services
at his coming trial. The Jackson case is
Mr. Cook's thirty-third murder trial, and
none of his clients have ever been called
on to face the hangman, though a few of
them are in retirement at San Quentin.
STRONG MEN CONTEST.
Max Fninfr Succnrub* to a Muscular
Mao Fiom Sweden.
Max Fenner, a strong man of local
fame, and August W. Johnson of Sweden
engaged in a lifting contest at the ban
Francisco Turn Verein Hall last evening.
Tbe contest was announced to be for a
purse of $500, each man to perform five
feats.
Johnson won the bout by one point.
He showed superior skill, while Fenner
excelled in feats where strength only was
required. Ueorge Miehling of the Olym
pic Club acted as referee.
Previous to the weight-lifting H. Lun
din and Jack Stelzner gave a three-round
boxing exhibition.
A NEW PLAN IN MEDICAL PRAC
TICE.
A Method That Is Dignified and Deserv
edly Popular.
Considering that it has been extraor
dinarily successful in the treatment of
catarrh and throat trouble?, it may be
safely said that the Copeland Medical In
stitute is without a rival in that impor
tant branch of the medical profession.
With none of the deceptive allurements
of sensational advertise s, the Copeland
Institute is thoroughly reliable and very
popular, with its plan of treating diseases
for $5 per month and furnishing all medi
cines free. *
Meeting of Hibernians.
In Ancient Order of Hibernian circles there
is great activity at present. Every division is
adding to its roll. Before a year is over the
officers expect to add several thousand new
members in this State. There will be several
open aieetintrs in the near future. This
afternoon at Odd Fellows' Hall the Ladies'
Auxiliary wi'l have an important open meet
ing and a very fine literary and musical pro
gramme. There will be patriotic addresses by
Colonel O' Byrne, Dr. Thomas Galvan and
others, and singing by Miss Black, Miss Neeb,
William Hlnes, W. W. Finnle and other promi
nent ladies and gentlemen. Great prepara
tions have been made by the ladies for this,
their first open meeting, and they expect it
will be very successful. Next Wednesday even-
Ing at Metropolitan Temple there will be a
grand reunion of all the City divisions. The
hall will no doubt be crowded. The programme
for this has been arranged with great care
and will be exceptionally good. The best lit
erary and musical talent has been engaged so
that the exercises will be a treat to the audi
ence. James R. Kelly, president of the Hibernia
Bank, will deliver the address.
Musicians Klerted.
At an election of the Musicians' Mutnal Pro
tective Union Ot San Francisco, held last
merit, the following officers were elected for
1897: F. Delleplane, president; E. Rosner,
vice-president; a Davis, secretary; T. Eis

KEEPING HIS
RECORD BRIGHT
Why San Francisco's New
Postoffice Was Not
Begun.
Secretary of the Treasury
Anxious to Retire
Gloriously.
Patient People of this City Have
Waited Twenty Years, and
Still Hope.
Some day the people of San Francisco
will point with pride to the handsome
Postoffice structure at the corner of Sey
enth and Mission streets. That much is
reasonably certain, for it is written in the
Records of Congress and confirmed by the
copious promises of all Kinds and condi
tions of lofty powers.
But when ? That is the poser that is be
ginning to disturb local patriots. There
have been delays and postponements
galore on this proposition, but always
before on what looked like logical, or at
least tangible, excuses. There were all
sorts of unlooked-for difficulties attending
the purchase of the lot, and then after its
purchase a competent engineer and an
able corps ol assistants* started in to probe
the Mission-street property for a bottom.
'They claimed to have found everything
lovely and then nothing seemed in the
way of the immediate institution of pro
ceedings.
"On the Ist of November," said the
powers that be, "the new Postoffice will
certainly be commenced." The Ist of
November is long since past. The powers
that promised are, many of them, nearine
the hour of their valedictory, but the vir
gin soil at Seventh and Market street, save
for the shovels of the prospectors for
foundation, remains undisturbed.
Secretary D. S. Richardson of the local
Postoffice declared himself as much in the
dark as any citizen in regard to the mat

SOCIETY'S ADIEU
TO THE HORSES
Brilliant Finale of the
Equine Show in the
Pavilion.
Swelldom T rongs the Seats to
See and Bs Seen Around
the Ring
As a Social Event the Exhibition Was
a Pronounced Success and the
Steeds Were Goo l .
When the show opened in the mornine:
there was a fair attendance of spectators,
though most of those present were in
some way interested in horses or rigs.
The earlier events oi the day kept things
moving and included various classes that
were filled and keenly competed for.
The first class to be judged was 14 on
the catalogueâ horses three years old and
over and shown fo wacon or harness. The
entries were: E. W. A. Waterhouse's
chestnut stallion Quicksilver Junior, J. P.
Dunn's bay celdint: Hailstorm, John Par
rott's gray mare. Twilight, Melville
Schweitzer's bay gelding Aleck. Herbert
Levy's brown mare Hermia, Frank Gor
man's chestnut gelding Colonial, J. C.
Kirkpatrick's black mare Azalia, Charles
F. Hanlon's bay gelding Fred, Frank H.
Burke'? jrray mare Edie, A. B. Sprecfeels'
chestnut gelding A. B. Wilkes, Agnew
stock farm's chestnut pelding Tommy
Down, Andrew McDowell's gray Gelding
Caryie Came. W. S. Hobart's chestnut
mare Hazel Wilkes and black mare Mat
tie Merrill, W. H. Vioget's brown stallion
Will Nutling, H. E. Wise's bay mare
Madera and A. B. Spreckels' bay gelding
Grove A. The blue ribbon went to Mr.
Hobart's Hazel Wilkes, the red ribbon to
Mr. McDowell's Caryie Came, the white
ribbon to the Agnew stock farm's Tommy
Dawn and the yellow ribbon to Mr. Kirk
patrick's Azalia.
The next events were judging one coach
ing stallion and two coaching stallions in
class 30 and 31, in which George B. Sperry's
imn. Young Adonis with two colts and
one filly won a first prize. In the next
class the same horse eot another blue rib
bon. Nonpareil, exhibited by J. S. McCue,
won second prize.
Two pony tandems competed in class
64 A for prizes. They were limited to 14
hands 2 inches, and W. S. Hobart won
first prize against Mrs. C. H. Leadbetter
Jr.'s team that got the second prize.
George A. Pope's handsome chestnut
horse Arlington was taken sick and had
to be scratched in all the classes in which
he was entered, so he was out of class 47
for the best hiijh-stepper 15 hands 2 inches
and over. The considerations in this class
were s ; yle, conformation and action, and
the horses had to be shown before appro
priate two- wheeled vehicles. It proved
to be the event cf the morning. Walter
Hobart had Peacock, Paragon, Madison
Square, Monarch and The Czar in against
Pcpe's solitary Sweetheart. Hobart's
horses in this contest won many prizes,
and it was generally believed that the
crack horse Madison Square would carry
off the blue ribbon. But the judges, who
knew their business, thought differently,
for Pope took the blue ribbon with Sweet
heart. The Czar got second prize, Mon
arch third and Paragon was highly com
mended.
The performance of professional coach
men driving pairs of horses closed the
mornine's programme. Only three coach
men entered out of the many in and. near
San Francisco: Joseph Dyer, driver for C.
A. Baldwin; Peter McKenna, coachman
for G. A. Pope, and John Carroll, coach
man for Henry J. Crocker. Dyer was an
ideal in the box, stiff and haughty and

of Glory.
tha correct thine, don't you knowâ eyes
ahead, a rod down his back and arms in
hidden splints. At least it looked like
that arrangement, and he won the prize.
McKenna won the second prize and Car
roll the third. W. S. Hobart's head man,
Fred Rockett, turned up his nose at the
performance.
"McKenna, 'c hain't the 'cad coachman
for Mr. Pope: 'c's honly the driver for
Mrs. Pope," Fred explained with an air
of ennui. "Really, you know, Hi couldn't
enter against 'im. 'Ad Mr. Pope's 'cad
man gone in, Hid be in, too."
Etiquette is everything nowadays, and
the head coachman, who won't take the
lines until he pulls up his gloves, is up to
date on ethics.
The third annual horse show closed last
night in the usual "blaze of glory. " Henry
Crocker, the president, was all smiles,
which incidentally led another officer of
the association to remark that so much
smiling gave him a cold. Everybody con
nected with the management was de
lighted, and especially so because the end
was the most brilliant part of the show.
The seating capacity of the Pavilion as
arranged for this occasion was taxed to its
utmost last night, when, in spite of tne
storm, all swelldom turned out, and with
it tne crowds that paid fancy prices for
chain off in the background. It was a
striking scene under the lights wheu the
show was at its height. All around the
ring was a moving mass of ladies and
t*Â»eir escorts, the ladies in appropriate
gowns, and behind were the boxes, every
one of them packed with fashionable
people.
Still further back were the tiers of seats
crowded with a select share cf the local
population. There, too, evening dress
and elegant costumes were in order, and
everywhere an air of superiority was
apparent.
The ring itselfâ well, it was the ring in
the horse show. Otherwise it was not
startling, except when some novelties
were introduced. It was simply a show
by a few men, wilh an occasional out
sider by way of variety. Still society
sealed it with the seal of approval and the
horse show was the tiling.
The rain and the murky atmosphere did
not deter the ladies from attending the
show in the afternoon, and of course such
considerations never once entered into the
minds of the sterner sex that for the last
tew days divided its admiration in un
known proportions at the Pavilion. The
boxes were mostly occupied, and the little
ones with overweening ambitions to nos
sess ponies, or at least a pony like Tad
pole, crowded every available spot round
the ring. And as ior the rows of r served
seals in the rear, they were comfortably
filled and even tbe galleries had a fair
share of spectators. This was interesting
to nee while the rain rattled mightily on
the roof.
Promptly on time four horses in harness
were judged in class 35. Half of the en
tries were scratched. This class was for
mares or geldings 15 hands 1 inch and
under 15 hands 3 inches, suitable for road
work in gig or dog cart. W. S. Hobart's
Peacock won the blue ribbon, George A.
Pope's Arsenal got the second prize, Ho-
"Now, if I only had old Doblin
here Fd show them fellers a
hoss what is a hoss."
bart's The Sid got third and Henry J.
Crocker's Dorothy was highly com
mended.
Racing ponies were jndged iv class 74a,
which next appeared iv the ring. This
was entirely Hobart's affair. The leading
young horseman had his ponies in parade
and took first prize with Gold Coin, sec
ond with Comanche, third with Doc Teyis
and tne nighiy commended rosette with
Brandy. Mr. Breden showed his Texas
Sittings, but merely showed him.
The spectators were treated to a view of
the horses entered lor exhibition and had
an opportunity to compare notes oi the
different swell steeds that passed around
on parade.
Class 34, which followed, included pairs
of mares or geldings 14 handy 1 inch and
under 15 hands 1 inch. They were just
the right Kind for u*e on roads in phaefons
or like vehicles. W. S. Hobart took the
blue ribbon again, this time on Pride and
Prejudice, two handsome bays, and George
A. Pope got second prize on Romulus and
Remus, while the house declared by its
applause that his pair was the prettier and
nicer in this particular class. After the
ribbons were awarded the twe teams drove
round the ring, but Pope's received the
decision of the house. More than one of
the old and well-qualilied judges of horses,
outside the ring, admitted it.
There was nearly a half hour to spare,
and little Tadpole was brought into the
ring for an exhibition of jumping. He
cleared five-foot hurdles witnout a rider,
whereat evÂ«ry little boy and girl in the
boxes exclaimed, "I must have a pony!"
Then it was the proper thing for children
to seek Tadpole and â '"just pat him" in
his stall. Texas Sittings and Huntress en
tertained the house by clearing hurdles in
graceful style until it'was time to call the
driving trotters judged in class 13.
There were three horses entered â
Owyhee, by John F. Boyd of Oakwood
Park, J H C, by William H. Vioget of
Lawrence, Santa Clara County, and Gen
eral Barnes, by the Aenew stock farm,
Hillsdale. These Horses were awarded
prizes respectively as named.
The grand event of the afternoon was
the contest in class 58a for the best per
formance of an amateur in driving a four
in-hand through obstacles. Henry Crocker
tooted bis four dashing bays, JosSph D.
Grant was in the ring with his elegantly
appointed rig and bis four little beauties,
C. A. Baldwin with his dignified four and
the yellow and blacfc break ana W. 8.
Hobart with a picked team of prize
winners competed. The test was severe.
Each competitor handled his own team,
but only Mr. Grant went through in good
style. He picked up his horses and trotted
through the obstacles without drawing in
the lines. Mr. Crocker got safely through
the pedestals, but only by pulling up
occasionally. Then the track was cleared
and only Mr. Grant's team remained.
Mr. Crocker heard a lady remark as he
drove past the gate, "That's too bad,"
and the gallant president of the snow
smiled and touched his hat. But he re
turned to the ring. The different drivers
changed and their skill was tested with
Mr. Grant's four. After a long trial Mr.
Crocker won the blue ribbon and with it
the silver cup offered Dy A. B. Bpreckels.
The closing features of the afternoon's
entertainment were the parade cf all win
ners in classes for ponies in harness and
of all winners in classes for driving trot
ters, roadsters and pacers.
The Pavilion was crowded at night, nor
was the large attendance confined to so
ciety itself, but the galleries and back
seats were well filled, and so fur as patron
age on the closing night is concerned there
could be no reason to complain. In fact,
the Horse Show Association was delighted
witti the support accorded, for there was
an immense crowd present in rheeveniiiL-,
and the whole house was warm, enthusi
astic Â«nd well pleased.
The last performance opened with juder
ing two teams of four draught norses each,
the horses to be over 1500 pounds.
Golden Gate Park entered Tom, Jerry,
Bob and Beiie, ponderous grays, and M*c-
Nab Â«fc Smith had their truck team, Fred,
Dan, Joe and Sam, in the ring. Both
teams were gray and looked as much alike
as peas in a pod, but the Park team had
the best coat and in other points were su
perior, and to the delight of the Park
stable manager they gol the blue ribbon.
McNab & Smith's team got second prize.
James McCue gave another exhibition
of bis trick horse that needed no bridle or
reins to guide him, and received rounds of
applause.
In class 39 six road horses in gigs or dog
carts were judged. They were restricted
to 15 hands 3 inches and over. George A.
Pope's Sweetheart was again successful,
taking the blue ribbon. W. 8. Hobart's
Monarch won the second ribbon and Henry
J. Crocker's Edgar, a chestnut horse, got
third prize.
Then followed a parade of all winners in
classes for saddle horses. They made a
pretty spectacular display aa they passed
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1896.
around with more or less ribbons tied to
their bridles. Before they all got out of
the ring the prizewinners in classes for
horses in harness and carriage horses en
tered and showed themselves to an admir
ing throng.
The best park amateur drivers were
judged in class 58 for fours-in-hand before
drags. The horses counted 60 ppr cent,
and appointments 40 per cent. W. S.
Hobart carried off the blue ribbon with
I'is learn Czar, Sultan, Damrosch nnd
Seidl. Henry J. Crocker got second prize
with E i win, Edgar, Prince and Dorothy.
The spectators were treated to a novel
exhibition of Walter Morosco's six-in-hand
driven by Jake Foster. The six dorses are
jet black, highly spirited animals and the
carriage a gorgeous combination phaeton.
And tne way that Foster drove was enough
lo arouse the envy of the swell coachmen.
The next spectacular pvent was the ex
hibition of W. S. Hobart's thoroughly
appointed road coach with four in hand,
a footman in flaming scarlet livery, who
could blow any tune on his long horn,
and a cockhorse with a liveried boy riding
away in front.
The park policemen, William Wallace
and Joel A. Harlan, competed in throwing
the lasso. Harlan never missed in his
throws and was awarded first prize, Wal
lace was second and Park Policeman
Arellanes third. Officer Arellanes never
missed, and what is more he called each
throw. The decision, however, rested with
the judges.
In the exhibition of buckinsr broncos
two daring riders set the house wild with
excitement. Their Uorses "bucked" and
twisted, but did not throw the riders, one
of whom, William Leiivero, a vaquero.
living at 220 Ninth avenue. Richmond,
met with a bad accident while sitting
quietly on his Horse beside the fence. The
horse "took fright and "bucked" over the
railing among the spectators and fell upon
Lelivere.
A groom grabbed the horse and others
extricated tne rider, who was carried to
the Receiving Hospital. Lelivere's collar
bone was broken and he received severe
contusions.
The last event of the year was jumping
by horses entered in class 82. There were
eleven competitors and they took the
hurdles cleverly.
Bobart's Huntress was given the first
prize, his Â«ray horse Royalty the second
ribbon and H. C. Breeden's Texas Sift
ings the third prize. A horse from Port
land, Or., Blairheart, owned by Mrs.
Thomas Fitzgibbons of that city, was
highly commended, while i is perform
ance won applause from the audience.
It was tuen close to midnight, and to
the strains of an inspiring air by the
orchestra the fashionable gathering dis
persed and the horse show of 1886 was
over.
BALDWIN WAS ATTACHED.
A Bill of $53 Caused Much Trouble
Behind the Scenes.
There was a little sideshow not on the
programme yesterday afternoon at the
Mechanics' Pavilion, and it caused con
sternation behind the scenes among
grooms, coachmen and other 3. The cen
tral figure was C. A. Baldwin of Santa
Clara County, the swell exhibitor. The
otlier figure was a Deputy Sheriff.
Mr. Baldwin was served with an attach
ment for $53, balance of a bill dun a horse
trainer named Jamea Garland since last
April.
Attorney C. W. Stoffers, with a Deputy
Sheriff, entered the stables while Baldwin
was driving his coach and four-in-hand in
tne ring.
They immediately went to Baldwin's
section and attached his prize pony Tris
tan, then ready to enter the ring hitched
to a buggy. Tristan had two first- prize
ribbons and one third-prize rosette tied to
his bridle, and it really was a shame to
touch him, he looked so proud.
As Baldwin's head man, Dyer, was about
to drive the pony into the ring the Deputy
Sheriff caught the lines.
â 'Hold ou, there; you can't go in," he
said.
'That's 1 all right," replied Dyer, whose
face was a study at this moment.
"No, it is not all right."
The Hass-caller interfered and had a
bru-ih with the deputy sheriff.
"Well, let him pull out of the way of
other ponies," saiu the caller.
Tristan was released momentarily and
Dyer, taking advantage of the freedom,
dashed through the open gates into the
ring.
Meanwhile Baldwin was informed of the
attachment and he went out to get the
money. Half an hour later he returned
with the $53 and the attachment was
raised.
To Test the Tax Question.
J. C. Corbett, F. J. Silvey and W. H. McNeil,
by their attorneys, Haven <Sc Haven, have ap
plied for a writ of mandate to compel Treas
urer Widber to pay $40 05 alleged overcharge
on taxes levied on the property of Harris,
Kingston & Co. This action involves tne re
payment of a large amount of taxes that are
said to have been collected by mistake on ac
count of the action of the State Board of
Equalization. Judge Seawell has set Wednes
day, December 23, as time for hearing argu
ment in the case.

Dangerous lilaze.
A one-story frame building- at 409 Sutter
street belonging to James Govern and occu
pied by Hopke Brothers as a dyeing establish
ment was destroyed by fire yesterday after
noon. The fire was caused by the careless use
of benzine, which was being used In cleaning
gloves.
The loss was only about $300, but a neigh
boring three-story building had a narrow
escape.
Flrnt Half of Patergon's Fee.

thorizing tbe executors of the estate of James

CAME ON THE
FIRST WAGON TRAIN
Strange Career of J. D. Ap
plegate, Commissioner
of the Klamaths.
The Veteran Indian Fighter on
the Resurvey of the
Reservation.
The Red Men Will Probably Get Pay
for 500,000 Acresâ Resident of
Oregon 54 Years.
Registered at the Grand Hotel is a tall
man, with bushy gray hair and rather
stern features, who walks with a quick
step and who would be marked as a man
of strong self-reliance and individuality.
He is J. D. Applegate of Klamath Falls,
Or., who came to the Webfoot State fifty
four years aeo. He came on the first
wagon-train that ever rolled down into
Oregon from Fort Hall. With him on the
train was Peter H. Burnett, who afterward
became the first Governor of California.
Mr. Applegate is from Missouri and cf
the famous family of Applegates, who
J. D. APPLEGATE; Who Came in the First Wa^on Train to
Oregon.
[Sketched from life by a "Call" artist.]
were the first settlers of Oregon and long
prominent in the affairs of that State.
Lindsay Applegate was his father, and
Elisha Applegate, once Surveyor-General
of Oregon and known for many years as
the Sage of Yoncalla, wa3 his uncle.
Mr. Applegate, who is now here, is a
veteran Indian fiehter. He has been in
the most famous wars with the SnaKes,
the Klamaths, the Modocs and other In
dians. Probably no man in Oregon has a
more intimate knowledge of the wild and
unfrequented parts of that State than Mr.
Applegate. He is now here finishing up
his work as one of the three Indian Com
missioners appointed some months ago by
President Cleveland to survey the Klam
ath reservation. R. P. Hammond of this
City and W. R. Coleman of Missouri are
the other Commissioners. They spent
almost three months in surveying the
boundaries of the reservation, and are now
here to make up their report.
"What our report will be." said Mr. Ap
plegate yesterday, "of course I am unable
now to state, except that for one thing â
none of the settlers in any of the country
bordering the reservation will be inter
fered with. I would like to have you know
so that they may be entirely relieved of
anxiety on that score. The Indians have
all .along claimed that their reservation
fell short of what it should be by some
500,000 or 600,000 acres. They claim that a
large part of the fertile valley lying east of
the reservation should have been included
in It, and also that a considerable lot of
land to the north ought to have been
in it.
"When the boundaries of the reserva
tion were taken, away back in 1864, tne
crests of different mountains were made
the landmarks, and the description of the
land was taken down very briefly by aid
of an interpreter. The Indian names of
the mountains and other places were
designated and those names became
speedily unknown, so that now when one
hears these names, or at least when a
majority do, they have no conception of
what tne meaning is. It was with the
end in view of straightening out the
whole matter that the commission was
appointed. We had some pretty rough
work. We had a lot of survey outfits and
we climbed mountains, some of them as
muoh as 8000 feet high.
"The land that, the Indians wiil get will
be lieu lands, that is land outside of the
reservation in some other place wnere
there are no settlers to be disturbed, or
tha value of the land at the time the
treaty was made. Probably the latter
way will be the way that it* will be
settled.
"Now a word about Klamath Falls.
Probably you would like to know a little
something about that and the country we
have there. It's a big country, a great
deal of it Tory fertile, and with water power,
the like of which it is hard to find
anywhere in the country. Tne little
town of Klamath Falls is a busy place and
an important trading point. It has elec
tricity in all the houses for lighting pur
poses, has a water system, too, which
delivers water in all the residences.
â¢ "The great business up there is stock
raising. Being away from the railroad,
it doesn't pay to raise large quantities of
grain and other vegetables and products
for shipment. We have to devote our at
tention to raising something that we can
drive out, and lor this reason raising cattle
and other stock has been the most profit
able business that our people couid engage
in. We need a railroad, I suppose we will
have one some day, and when we get it
it will open up the country very rapidly.
"Then one great thing' we have up there
is Crater Lake, the new National park of
Oregon. That is in our county. It takes
about two days to get there, but Klamath
Falls is the point from which you start.
Crater Lake always will be a wonderful
attraction, not only for Oregon people, but
for vast numbers of tourists."
Mr. Appiegate and his associates will
probably be engaged a week yet on their
report.
HAWKS OBSCURED THE SUN
The Seatou Following the Snake Season
in Maryland Opens Well.
Next to the eastern shore, the western
mountains are the most interesting por
tion of Maryland. There is always some
thing going on. Directly the snake sea
son closes in Washington County the
hawk| season begins in Ailegany. This
past season was one of the best snake eras
in the history of Washington County.
Each day there was a snake story, until
peoDle got to expect them in the morning
paper and feel sorry when by some chance
they did not appear. The closing of the
series appeared the other day. A snake
along the canal had ruined its digestion
by swallowing an enormous ear oi Wash
ington County corn, with the shuck on, in
the same raw condition as were the stories
people had to swallow.
But as we have said, that story ends the
series, and lhe hawk season has promptly
opened in Allegany, the adjoining county.
Last night the Sun received the following
dispatch from a correspondent in Cum
berland:
"Farmers from the lower section of
Allegany County report tbe passage in a
southwesterly direction of a flock of hawks
that was two miles wide and was fully
three hours in crossing the valley. The
sun was obscured for a while by the
moving black cloud. One farmer not
satisfied as to the species of the birds, firea
into the Hock and brought down six. They
were found to belong to the bird and not
cbickenhawk species."
Borne people may think that this story
is exaggerated, and that the farmers in
the lower part of Allegany expanded two
yards into two miles, just as some people
suppose they can expand 50 cents into $L
But the story may be entirely correct,
except possibly with respect to the cloud
being two miles wide. It may have lacked
some little of that width.
We have some indistinct recollection of
a true hawk story which came from the
Eastern Shore some years ago. According
to that story one of tne remote districts
of Dorchester County, bordering on the
bay, was visited by hawks in a multitude
such as is described in the Cumberland
dispatch; possibly not quite such a multi
tude, Dut still a multitude. At that time
the county was paying a reward for
hawks' scalps. "When the hawks appeared,
therefore, every man and boy who had a
gun went to slaughtering hawks, and the
county was only saved from bankruptcy
by the failure of the supply of ammuni
tion. As it was, the bill for hawk scalps
was so great that an act was rushed
through the next Legislature to repeal the
hawk bounty. Indeed, some of the East
ern Shore men wanted a special session
called. â Baltimore Sun.
JAPANESE REVERE ROYALTY.
Object to Having Stamps Bearinc Llke
nessuH Canceled.
Private letters from Kioto bear proof
thot the Japanese have their own way of
doing things, says the Boston Journal.
They recently had a new issue of postage
stamps which bore portraits of two of the
princes who died in the recent war.
Stamps of 2 and 5 sen were to be issued.
Iv the United States one portrait would
have been put on the 2-sen stamp and one
on the 5-sen stamp, but in Japan it was
thought that this would be discriminating
against tne memory of the one pictured
on the lower denomination.
This is why philatelists find that there
are two new 2-sen and two new 5-sen
stamps â each uenominatiou having one
kind in memory of each prince. But even
this careful arrangement dia not prevent
a new trouble. Sjmo conservative Japan
ese are contending that it borders on dis
respect to the imperial family to pollute
their pictures with saliva and then to
blotch them with ink in the process of !
cancellation.
One man has declared in the papers that
be will decline to receive any mail matter
bearing these stamps. Some postmasters
have requested that they be allowed to
put the canceling mark only on the edge
of the stamp, so as to avoid defiling the
princely faces. To old-fashioned Jap
anese it is especially displeasing to see
foreigners putting portraits representing
men of divine descent into their mouths
and putting them on the envelopes witb
as much indifference as we employ with
the faces of Washington, Franklin and
Grant on our stamps. Some Japanese, if
they use the stamps at ail, must rever
ently lift them Â»o their head, carefully
wet the glne with pure water, and then
utter a prayer as they attach them to the
envelope. . " ' â¢
Did it ever occur to an American that it
was discrimination to place a portrait on
a lower denomination stamp? It this
matter ever was discussed it was probably
agreed that the greater honor went with
the cheaper stamps, which are in wider
and more general use. As lor attaching
any respect to them â do you know, with
out looking, whose pictures are on our va
vious stamps?

EXAMINED BY THE MAT.
Dr. Cook, the Great Specialist,
Admits a Reporter to His
Laboratory.
A Marvelous System of Treatment
With Different Kinds of Elec-
trical Current.
Among the many subjects of keen pub-
lic interest to-day there is none that
claims more| attention than that of the ap-
plication of the great X ray discovery of
Dr. Roentgen, and especially is this true
when its use by medical men :s consid-
ered. The demand for X ray instruments
has been enormous, so the makers of
scientific instruments say, and the medi-
cal fraternity generally is much stirred up
over the matter. It is eminently gratify-
ing to know, however, that one of the
finest, and probably the very finest, ap-
paratus of this nature which has ever
been constructed in the world was secured
by Dr. Cook, the eminent specialist of BG-5
Market street. That fact is not surpris-
ing, as it is well known in scientific cir-
cles that Dr. Cook is invariably tho first
physician to pour out his money on any
improvement in medical or surgical ap-
paratus, no matter in what quarter of the
globa the discoveries are made. Cost
what they may, this learned specialist
buys them all, and after submitting them
to most careful experiments keeps what
he finds to be unquestionably good. Ever
since the installation of his grest X ray *
apparatus, it has been the custom to beg 1
from him an opportunity to see a patient I
examined by it. so that a full account f
might be given of it, bat as all his pa- 1
tients' affairs are kept very strictly confi-
dential, it was not till a couple of days
ago that some one was found . who was
willing to have a reporter present when
the doctor "looked through him," as he
called it. '
After a wait of a few minutes the party
proceeded to the specially arranged de- .
partment where the wonderful instru-
ments are, and not a moment was lost in
preliminaries. The patient stood np, held
by two assistants, the electrical 1 apparatus
was started in motion with a qneer burr-
ing Bound, and the doctor, with steady
hand and eye ablaze- with interest, placed
the observing screen at the patient's ci.e?t.
All was silent as : death, except for the
whir of the dynamo, and slowly the screen
was passed .from point to point over the
entire front of the body, and this com-
pleted the /patient was turned round and
an examination of the back was begun in
the Bnme'way. Eventually ' the doctor
paused. -Evidently he had j become much
interested. For minutes he never moved
his glance from the screen. Then the on-
ward march was taken up again, and at
length the examination- was completed.
Notes having been made 'the.reporter was
allowed to look through the screen just at
where the X ray had; shown the seat of
disease to be. It was' simply marvelous.
There plainly, even to an. untutored
eye, was a distinct enlargement of the liver,
the construction and form of which was as
plainly visible as if the man had been dis-
sected then and there. -
"I shall first of all treat him with Far-
radic electrical current.", said -the doctor
as the party left the X-ray department,
and consent being again given an ad-
journment was made to the medical elec-
trical department. Here there is a grand
combination of ; device?, probably the best
in existence, for imparting the electrical
current airebtly to any part of the system.
On one side are arranged the connections
for giving galvanic ele^trJ^jil energy, and
from the other the Farradic current
issues. A large switchboard, which con-
trols the distribution of the force from
I three distinct sets of storage batteries, is *â 
on one side of the room, and there is also
an operating-table and a cabinet of modi- 1
cal and surgical appointments. "Before
treating him," said Dr. Cook, "I will ex-
| amine bis throat and allow you to do the
! same, but in advance I may tell you that
it will certainly be found to be a little ul-
cerated." He then inserted a very tiny
. -w& <'^'~- 'â  'â  t â  ' .\ . - ...

electric light into the back of the man's
mouth, and on being allowed to inspect it
the reporter was both amazed and a little
bit terrified. :
The electric li.-ht showed the con-
struction of- the throat most vividly, and
a fearful mass of uiceration it was. . So
bright whs the tiny thing that you could see
it clearly through the sides of the mouth.
As the reporter was about to retire in
order that the treatment mi.'ht commence,
calling the.'doctor to one side ho asked if
sucti a very severe case could be cured by
any means. "Oh, yes," was the reply.
"\V T e have had cases . a good deal worse
than that. 'His is principally neglect of
a bad case of blood disorder, but we shall
pull him through. : In fact I don't believe t }
that there is a case of this sort nowadays
that is altogether incurable."
It may be stated in closing that % single
inspection of .Dr. Cook's wonderful equip-
ment will ; demonstrate to the greatest
doubter that not only have great strides
been made in medical electricity in this
age, but it is very plain too that Dr. Cook '
is altogether entitled to the place which
he has long since neld, namely that of
the most progressive a.Â« well as the most
Competent specialist on the const. .

A Portion of the System Built

Board.
Escape From an Epid mic of Disease
a Mysteryâ Will Cost the
City $io,ooo.
At the meeting of the Board of Super
visors to-morrow the Health Department
will petition for an order for immediate
repairs to the sanitary arrangements of
the City and County Hospital.
Since the explosion at the hospital sev
eral weeks ago those who have been con
ducting the repairs have discovered that
the mass of pipes beneath and about the
buildings dignified by the name of a sew-
One of the Broken and Worthless Sewer-Pipes at the City
and Cctmty Hospital.
erage system is merely a disjointed,
broken jumble oi no earthly use except to
line the pockets of contractors.
A large portion of this piping was put in
years ago, but ?ome of it was constructed
during tbe last six months and under tbe
administration of the present Board of
Health. How it is that such worthless
pipe and faulty connections could have
been put in without tbe board's plumbing
inspector, who is expected to look out for
all such matters, knowing of the matter is
something that the Health Department
will probably be asked by the Supervisors
before tne necessary money is voted for
repairs.
That an epidemic of typhoid, diphtheria
or other contagious disease has not
broken out in the institution is a mystery
to tbose who have seen tbe mass of
disease-breeding tilth that has escaped
through broken pipe and open joints and
settled in fetid pools under tbe structure.
It will cost the City about $10,000 to pro
vide a proper seweraee system.

WON AND LOST.
Judge Hunt Refuses New Trials In the
Cases of Aiash vs. Kreling;.
Mrs. Ernestine Kreling won a casÂ« and
lost one in Judge Hunt's court Thursday.
So did John E. Nash. Mr. Nash held a
4 responsible position In the Tivoli Theater,
I of which Mis. Kreiing is proprietor, and
\ on being discharged sued for four weeks'
ealary at $90 per week. ThÂ« jury gave
him a verdict for $360, the full amount
claimed. ..
Mrs. Kreling did not like tbe verdict,
and moved for a rlew trial.
Having succeeded so well in hiÂ« first
attempt Mr. Nash sued Mrs. Kreling for
other weeks of service and for breach of
contract, calling for $1150. Judgment for
the defendant by the jury.
Then Mr. Nash moved for a new trial. i
Judge Hunt took up both cases yester
day, and having considered all the facts,
said he thought both : juries were right,
and so denied both motions. Appeals will
be taken, for when theatrical people quar

ONLY A FROLIC.
Light Sentences for City and County
Hospital Nurses and
Internes.
The Board of Health passed sentence
on Friday on four norses and one interne
who were concerned in the recent mid
night frolic at tbe City and County Hos
pital that was complained of by the head
nurse, Miss Patton.
The matter caused so much talk that
tbe board was compelled to order an in
vestigation and the Hospital Committee
has been engaged on tne matter for sev
eral days past.
From the evidence eecured it is appar
ent that the committee thought that- the
matter was nothing more than a frolic,
for the nurses who were concerned were
laid off for from one to three months and
tbe interne-was deprived of the benefit of
attendance at clinics until July 1.
O'CONNELL & LEWIS' DEBTS.
Voluntary Insolvency Petition Filed by
the Iron- Worker*.
Martin O'Connell and Oscar Lewis, com
prising tne linn of O'Connell & Lewis,
iron-workers, have filed a voluntary peti
tion in insolvency. The debts of the firm
amount to $(13,000 31, of which amount
they owe their employes $6548 35.
The largest creditor is N. Parrisb, whose
claim is for $12,479 98. Mrs. Hamblin has
a bill for $5200; Anglo-Californian Bank,
$2750; Stafford & Stafford, $500.

are incumbrances umouuting to $43,750;
homestead, $5000. incumtmred for $2750;
personal property, $18,400; property ex
empt from execution, $500.
The petition states that a considerable
amount is due to the insolvents on ac
count of contracts in course of comple
tion, all of which is surrendered for the
benefit of creditors. Tiiere are also some
book accounts owed them, the greater part
of which they consider uncollectible.
Valuation of the real estate is based on

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1896.
SCURF PIN LOST
A RICH PRIZE
Nosed Out by Midlight for
the Palace Hotel
Stake.
Willie Martin Furnished a
Splendid Ride Astride
the Winner.
Summertime Took the Handicap From
Wyomingâ Alvarado Captured
His R cc in a Gallop.
The wind screeched and howled and the
rain came down in blinding torrents, yet
it dampened the ardor ot but a few race
goers, for the crowd at Ingleside track
showed but a slight diminishment in
numbers yesterday. The Palace Hotel
stake for two-year-old fillies at six fur
longs was tbe stellar attraction of tbe
card, and the win of Green B. Morris'
good filly Midlieht through the superior
jockeyship of Willie Martin was quite the
sensation of tbe day. The stake drew out
but a field of six starters. Ed Purser's
Scarf Pin, with a long string of victories
to her credit in the East was, of course, a
pronounced favorite, the ring laying
some 4 to 5 against her chances just before
post call.
Fig Leaf witn her well-known liking for
muddy going had a large following, who
accepted 4 to 1 that was offered about her.
Midlight came in for considerable support,
being quite a hot paddock tip. Loulou R,
Queen Nubia and Nebula were the out
siders. The start was good for all but Fig
Leaf, who wheeled as the barrier flew up
and was almost left. Coady on tne favor
ite at once took the lead, and from tbe
way she paddled through the mud it
looked all over. Entering the stretch
Martin on Midlight was two or three
lengths away, and then it was that Coady
grew overconfident.
He counted on having too much in re
serve, and soon found the Mciris entry at
bis mount's side. He then sat down to
ride, but tne veteran Martin knew too
much for him, ana he lost the $1300 prize
by a good long nose. Fig Leaf followed
after the Pin, and, passing all but the
leaders, finished a distant third. The
winner, a brown filly by imp. Midlothian
from Ehctric Light, covered the distance
in 1:169& which, considering the fact
that she had up in the saddle 118 pounds,
was a remarkably eood performance.
This was not the only favorite that
bowed to defeat during the day's racing.
Bernardillo, Collins and Col. Weightman
also let the talent down very hard by lail
ing to run up to "liggers." Haymarket,
who won the hurdle affair at 20 to 1, was
the longest-priced winner during the
afternoon.
The card was, of course, marred by tbe
rain, many good horses being scratched.
Tbe mile handicap simmered down to a
field of seven, with Summertime an odds
on choice. She made all the running and
with little to spare led Wyoming, the
Spreckels entry, out something over a
lengtii in 1:44. Peter the Second, All Over,
Mamie SeoU, The Dragon and Andie
Buchanan, comprising^ tbe field, were
never able to extend the leaders.
The first event for two-year-olds, a six
furtong spin, saw a field of twelve line up
aeainst ti>e barrier. The Baldwin entry,
Bernardillo, was made a 9 to 10 choice,
and not carrying much wise money fin
ished third. Rey del Tierra, a 10 to 1 shot,
took the purse in a drive from tbe second
choice, Good Times.
The mile and a sixteenth selling run re
sulted in a skyrocket win for Aivarado,
against which 14 to 5 was laid. He led
throughout with nis 93 pounds up, passing
the stand galloping six lengths before Lit
tle Cripple. Tne Bto 5 favorite, Collins,
was unable to raise a gallop, straggling in
a bad seventh.
Andy Blakeley bad the pleasure of pilot
ing another favorite in a jumping race
which failed to land. Col. Weigb-tman,
with 159 pounds up, in the mile and a half

Notes.
Joseph J. Burke, presiding judge at
the Oakland track, has been commissioned
by an Eastern turfman to purchase Tea
Rose if that fast filly can be secured at
any reasonable figure.
Jockey Clawson was fined $25 for un
necessarily yanking and pulling at Addie
Buchanan at the post In the mile handi
cap.
It is said Colonel Weightman's owners
are disgusted with the gelding and are
looking for a buyer with coin at his dis
posal.
Orrin Hickok, the noted reinsman, who
recently arrived from the East, was a
visitor at the track yesterday.
The beautiful Shreve & Co. cup, to be
presented tp the winner of the handicap
at ingleside track on New Year's day, is
now on exhibition at the Palace Hotel
and excites many expressions of admira
tion. It should certainly serve to awaken
in the heart of a true sportsman many
pleasant memories of a favorite horse in
dnvs to come.
Fig Leaf displayed some very roguish
antics at tbe post, and many predictions
were made that she would be left. No
censure could be attached to Starter Har
vey, for she refused to break.
In the way of Australian gate work, Mr.
Harvey's work with the machine during
the meet just closed has been of a very
high older. He has had many vicious
and unruly starters to contend with, and
a glance at the form book will show that
they were almost invariably dispatched
witn their field.

A STUDENT'S SUICIDE.
John G. Locke Ends His Life With a
Kazor.
John G. Locke, a student of the Cali
fornia School of Mechanical Arts, com
mitted suicide by cutting a frightful gash
in his throat some time within forty-eight
hours preceding the finding of his body
by Captain Thomson of the park police
yesterday morning. The body was in the
brush at the north side of the park, near
'49 camp, and from its condition the
Morgue officials judged life had been ex
tinct for something over a day.
Locke, who was only about 20 years of
age, bad been staying with a brother, also
a student, at the residence of J. W. Place,
2328 Folsom street. Thursday night he
disappeared without previously "givJng
any indication of his nioibid frame of
mind.
His friends can assign no cause for his
desperate act except mental derangement,
induced by hard study. He was evidently
determined in his intention to end his
life, he having taken a pistol and a razor
with him. With the latter he gave him
self a slight gash across the wrist and
then inflicted a cut across the throat,
which the Morgue physician declares the
most cruel he has ever seen.
The young man's family, with the ex
cep'.ion of a sister, who is attending the
Normal School at San Jose, reside at
Lockeford, near Stockton. Wnen found
there was a bicycle cap beside the body.
It was also attired in bicycle shoes and
there was a pants' guard on one leg. The
bicycle was not discovered.
DIPHTHERIA CASES.
Two More V ere Reported at the Health
Department Yesterday.
Two cases of diphtheria, making 121
since October 1, were reported at the
Health oflic9 yesterday. The stricken
ones live at 22 San Carlos avenue, from
which other cases have been reported, and
nt 400 Golden Gate, hardly a stone's throw
from tne Health Office.
At the present rate the number ot cases
for this month bids fair to be double that
of November. In October there were
thirty-nine cases, in November forty-seven
and in the rast twelve days thirty-rive.
In spite of the belief of thÂ» Health Offi
cer tnat the disease has reached a point
where it in epidemic the members of the
Health Board are of a different opinion,
and there is little chance that it will be so
declaren, particularly as the change of
weather will have a tendency to check its
progress.
Some plants, as the peach tree, send
forth their flowers before the leaves have
started.
W. A. DEANE SAYS
HE IS THE AUDITOR
Mr. Broderick's Title to
the Office Is Chal
leng3d.
Alleged Malconduct on the Part
of tbe Inspectors of
Election.
Attorney Schooler Explains Why No
Charges of Corruption Are
Set Forth.
William A. Deane, the regular Republi
can nominee for Auditor of the City and
County of San Francisco at the last elec
tion, has by his attorney, William H.
Schooler, filed a contest to the claims of
William Broderick for that position.
For cause of action Mr. Deane alleges
that votes cast for him were unlawfully
counted for Mr. Broderick or other candi
dates and that if it had not been for mal
conduct on the part of election inspectors,
judges and clerks the official reports
would have shown that Mr. Deane re
ceived more votes than did Mr. Broderick.
For this reason he avers that he is en
titled to the office to which he was right
fully elected by a majority of the voters of
this City and County, and in order to
establish that fact demands a recount of
the votes.
The official returns as promulgated by
tbe Board of Election Commissioners
shows that the vote for Auditor in this
City at the last election stood as follows:
William Broderick 24,317, F. F. Strother
2383, A^a R. Weils 2514. A. F. Chapman
7835, Wiiliam A. Deane 23,447.
If these figures were accepted as true,
which Mr. Deane denies, tbe plurality for
Broderick would be only 870. In chal
lenging the correctness of tbe returns Mr.
Deane assigns a number of reasons for be
lieving that he was actually the recipient
of a majority of tho votes cast and that he
was unlawfully deprived of his victory.
Alleging malconduct on the part of elec
tion officers in different prec nets in the
City, Deane avers, from information and
belief, that many votes cast for him were
wrongfully and erroneously recorded as
having been oast for Broderick, while
some of his votes were credited to Strother,

AN APPEAL TO WEAK MEN.
Every man in his normal condition has a certain amount of vitality. If he exhausts or
uses that up he dies. When it is partially lost he becomes weak, nervous. Thousands of men
have lost sufficient of this vital force to unfit them for business or pleasure. Nearly nine out of
ten men are weak in this way and dosing themselves with drugs in their vain effort to get cured.
It is useless to expect this power from drugs, as all medical men admit that vital force is Electricity,
so nothing else will replace it. Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt is too well known to need a detailed
description. It soaks the body daily with the life of Electricity. This restores the vitality lost
from the system and makes manhood complete. We positively guarantee it to cure all forms of
Nervous Debility, Spermatorrhoea, Shrunken Parts, Nervousness, Forgetfulness, Confusion of
Ideas, Languor, Dyspepsia, Lame Back, Rheumatism, Kidney and Bladder Complaint and the
many evils resulting from secret habits in youth or excesses in maturer years. We wi3h to say
that the marvelous invention,
DR. SANDEN'S ELECTRIC BELT,
IS -A.3ST ABSOLUTELY POSITIVE CURB.
Nervous Debility.
SAN FRANCISCO, Cal., December 8, 1896.
DR. A. T. SANDENâ Dear Sir: At the time I bought your
Belt I was so nervous and shaky that I could not do any work
without feeling perfectly exhausted. I had what is called
nervous debility from excessive drinking and sexual excesses.
I was practically on my last leg*. My powers were all gone,
and I was sat is tied tnat I was a wreck. I had spent over $300
for medicines without tbe slightest benefit, when I was advised
to eet your Belt, I felt an improvement as soon as I commenced
to wear it. 1 continued steadily improving, until I now feel as
strong as I ever did in my life. I feel very grateful to you for
what your Belt has done for me, and shall cheerfully recom-
mend it to anyone in like condition. Yours truly,
H. KNOWLTON,
621 Kearny street. Residence, 2L9 Tehama street.
Spent a Fortune Seeking a Cure.
SACRA.MENTO, Cal., December s, 1896.
DR. A. T. SANDENâ Dear Sir: I have worn the Belt you
sent me for about four months, and it has done me a world of
good. I bad a continual drain from seminal weakness, which
is now itopped entirely. My sexual powers are restored and I
sleep and eat well. I feel like a roan again since I began wear-
ing your B#lt. Previous to wearing your Belt I had tried the
best physicians in the East and paid out a fortune, but to no
purpose. YourÃ truly, A. J. HAMMOND,
707 I street, Sacramento, Cal.

Wells and Chapman. It is further alleged
that votes intended for Strother, Wells
and Chapman were counted for Broderick,
and that a large number of votes cast for
Auditor were not counted at all.
Deane admits that he cannot state the
exact number of votes so miscounted
against him, nor does he specify in which
particular precincts the errors were com
mitted, but on information and belief
he alleges that by reason of the before
mentioned malconduct and wrongful
counting errors occurred in the canvass of
the votta oy which 1500 votes and upward
were counted for Broderick or some other
candidate for Auditor, and that at least
1000 cast for other candidates were wrong
fully counted for Broderick.
The complaint continues with the alle
gation "that as contestant is informed
and believes, he received a higher and
greater number of votes cast at elec
tion for said office of Auditor than were
cast for any other of the candidates for
said office, and tnxt by resson thereof said
contestant is entitled to all the rights,
privileges and immunities of said office of
Auditor of the City and County of San
Francisco."
After setting forth the fact that he has
complied with all the requirements of the
purity of election law, lieane asks the Su
perior Court to cite Broderick to appear
and answer this contest and that a special
session of tbe couit be called to hear and
determine the question upon a recount of
tbe ballots as by law allowed.
Mr. Schooler explains that the notice
of contest had not been filed at an earii r
date because it was not known offi
cially how the vote was purported to
stand until after the report of the Election
Commissioners had been ii.'eJ. He said
that specific allegations of fraud in partic
ular precincts had been avoided, because
such allegations were not requisite under
the code and that Mr. Deane had no de
sire to reflect upon any election officers in
advance of a disclosure of the condition of
the record.
This sentiment was reiterated by Mr.
Deane. Ho added that a great many af
fidavits purporting to expose crookedness
had been offered to him by gentlemen who
had visited voting-booths throughout the
City, but that he had in every case de
clined sucn offers, preferring to rely on
the result of the recount and letting the
errors as they appear be credited to un
intentional error or clerical mistakes
rather than to wilful fraud.
The case has been assigned to Judge
Trout for trial and will be called up in
Department 8 of the Superior Court to
morrow morning for the necessary prelim
inary proceedings.

DR. A. T. SANDENâ Dear Sir: I deem it my duty, for the
sake of others who may be afflicted as I was>, to give you a re-

badly troubled with seminal weekness of long standing, wnich
brought on lame back, night emissions, impotency, eta, all of
wnich went to make life miserable, instead of a comfort and
pleasure. I saw your ad. in the local papers and concluded to
try one of your Belts. After tb? first weeKs wearing I began to
improve, and have kept on steadily improving up to date, and
now I feel like life is worth living. All the above complaints
have disappeared, and 1 can ehjoy my meals and sleep soundly

weary, as I used to. I cannot praise your be:t to highly. It is
worth its weight in gold to all who have occasion to use It.
Very truly yours, A. HUFFMEYER,

THE YULETIDE JINKS.
The San Francisco PreÂ»Â» Club to Gives
Great Entertainment on Satur-
day .Evening.
The Yuletide jinks of the Press Club
will be given on Saturday evening, the
19th inst., at the club rooms in tbe Thur
low block. An elaborate programme has
been prepared. There will be an abund
ance of excellent vocal and instrumental
music; original papers, some gay, but
none too grave; witty speeches and poems
and oiher things in a literary sense to in
terest the members and their friends.
It was at first intended to invite the
lady friends of members, but on reflection
it was thought that perhaps as this was to
be the Christmas jinks, where ordinarily
greater freedom is allowed, it would be
best to entertain the ladies at sometime
hereafter, so it was settled that way.
Among those who are to take part in the
jinks are Wells Drury, Edward Moran,
Judge John Hunt, probably T. T. Wil
liams and a host of others who are known
as handy men with tongue and pen.
The subjoined invitation to the mem
bers voices the spirit that is abroad re
garding the jinks:
Not quite on "the night before Christmas" will wÂ»
Indulge in our an mini i-anta Clans spree.
The reason is obvious, for when we meet
At nine on the nineteenth and happily giest
Our fellows: when song and ihe foam-crestÂ«d beer
Conspire with kÂ»>' Wit for Â» night < f good cheer,
No knight of the graphite need shun the b:i;be
cup,
As almost a week he will nave to -'brace up"
Ere Christmas arrives with Its joys and the work
he
Will have to perform as a tomb for a turkey.
Then come, gentle member, and hero learn to
know
How to "let the world slide" and to "let the
world go."

AN INNOCENT BOY
TO BE SET FREE
R. Herrera in the State
Prison for Another's
Crime.
Petitions for Pardon and Parole
Acted Upon at San
Quentin.
Death of a Convict Whose Sku 1 Was
Fractured by a San Bernar
dino Officer.
The Board of State Prison Directors
met at San Quentin yesterday, and after
transacting the routine business took up
the cases of convicts who petitioned for
release on parole or pardons. In the lat
ter class was Ramon Herrera, who prayed
for full pardon, claiming that he was un
justly convicted and innocent of the crime
of which he was accused. The board will
recommend the Governor to grant a par
dun.
Herrera's case is of more than passing
interest, and the injustice to the young
fellow was tirst made public in the col
umns of The Call four weeks ngo. In
November, 1893, two armed men robbed a
Chinaruan oi several dollars and a\gold
watch on California and Stockton streets,
ieador Baldivia and Herrera were arrested
for the crime, and the Chinaman identi
fied them as the robbers. From the first
Baldivia, who made no defense, asserted
that Herrera was not guilty, buc he de
clined to give the name of his partner in
crime. A little later the Chinaman's
watch was recovered in a pawnshop,
where Manuel Porti llio had s-old it.
Portillio was arrested, but the China
man, fearing conviction for perjury if he
should change tbe testimony he gave in
the Police Court, still declared that Her
rera was the second man. Even before
Portiilio was tried he acknowledged to
several persons that he and not Herrera
was the trinity person, but to be brief, he
was acquitted and Herrera, then about 18
years oid, was sentenced to twenty years'
imprisonment. Baldivia was sentenced
for life. Portillio went to Mexico, onÂ« of
the conditions of his acquittal being that
he leave the State, and ne was killed in
that country while trying to rob a train.
The directors in reviewing the testi
mony of the trial and the evidence of the
young fellow's innocence as developed
since tbe trial, expressed their surprise
that the jury should have convicted Her
rera at all. The conduct of the Police
Court practitioners who had the three
cases was severely commented upon by
the directors for not Drincing forward the
evidence they had or should have had to
save the lad. Tney are thoroughly satis
fied that Ramon Herrera is innocent and
will ask Governor Budd to grant tne boy
a full pardon. Herrera has been in prison
thirty-four months.
A similar recommendation will be made
on behalf of Charles R. Hennessey, sen
tenced for twenty years for grand larceny.
This man was with George Hutcbinson
and several other men drinking with a j
woman in San Francisco. One of tbe
â¢party claimed that he had been robbed of |
$10, and Hennessey and Hutchinson were I
convicted. Long after the woman con
fessed that sue got away with the money,
which the accused gave her to purchase
beer with, unaer the supposition that it
was a 50-ceut piece. Hutchinson was par
doned and sent to his folks in New Zea
land. Director Wilkins said if one was en
titled to go free the other was also.
The directors will recommend that Gov
ernor Budd pardon Charles R. Thome,
provided the latter leaves the State.
Tnorne while out of funds tried to black
mail Miijor McLaughlin. The major
thinks the fellow is punished sufficiently,
having served three years.
The petition for parole of Redwood Day
was in a measure favorably considered.
Day was convicted of stage robbery near |
Ukiah and was sentenced to eight years' j
imprisonment. Tue testimony at the j
trial showed that 'he ojeraied with, the J
Uleiah church member, Deacon Old ham. j
Tue latter o-d hypocrite sang psalms and |
passed tue contribution-box on Sunday j
and robbed stages during the week. He |
was sentenced to eight years in Foisom. i
Day claimed that he was convicted simply |
because he had worn a long coat while in |
the vicinity of the last robbery. The |
board decided to grant his petition for
parole one year irom yesterday, provided
he leads an exemplary life during the en
suing twelve months in prison.
Abe Adcock asked to be released on
parole. He was sentenced to fifteen years
for robbery in Sonoma county. The pris
oner is at present in the hospital, very ill,
and was not able to appear, but the board
decided favorably to Adcock, and may
recommend either a commutation of sen
tence or a parole. This consideration for
the convict is because he is in very poor
health and has been an exceptionally well
behaved person.
Warden Hale made a report upon the
case of Samuel Webb, who, on November
13, was sent from San Bernardino County
for burglary. Upon his arrival at tbe
prison the turnkey, in taking his measure
ment and description, noticed a fresb
scalp wound on the convict's head.
The convict stated that the constable
who arrested him struck him a heavy blow
with a largo revolver. The prisoner did
not complain of feeling ill for several days
after reaching the prison, but later the
officials noticed that he appeared dazed
and stupid. He was at once sent to the
hospital by Dr. Lawior, the resident phy
sician, who did all he could for tbe con
vict's comfort. The latter continued to
grow worse and paralysis set in on the left
side, and finally he died on November 27.
Dr. Lawior held an autopsy, and upon ex
amining the dead man's head under the
lacerated wound found that his skull had
been crushed, making a hole three-quarters
of an inch in extent. The fracture was no I
doubt caused by the blow of the revolver j
described by Webb upon his arrival.
Warden Hale at once communicated
these facts to tbe Sheriff of San Bernar
dino County, who arrested Constable
Hickok for* manslaughter. Dr. Lawior
went to San Bernardino County in re
sponse to a request of the Sheriff, who
wanted tbe physician's testimony in the
case of the constable.
Warden Hale in his regular report
called attention to several matters of in
terest. One was in relation to prisoners
serving terms of imprisonment upon
more than one commitment. It seems
that Joseph T. Ross was sent from Merced
County on several commitments for
burglary, jail-breaking, etc.
Later another set ot commitments ar
rived, making nine commitments ir, ail,
but no one was for more than three years,
but all would foot up about twelve years.
It was not specified that one term should
commence at the expiration of tbe one
preceding, and the question was how
long under the recent decisions of the
Supreme Court and under the statutes the
man can be legally held in prison. The
board thought best not to take any action
in the case, but let the convict get out a
writ of habeas corpus, so that the court
could decide the matter m case he objects
to servine more than the longest (turee
/ears) term.
The warden reported the appointment of
Charles E. Alden as superintenuent of the
jutemill, E. F. Gilligan as foreman of tbe
iutemiii and J. W. O'Docneil as assistant
in the commissary department, all of
which were confirmed by the board.
Mr. Hale reported that the jutemill has
recentJy been thoroughly renovated and is
now in perfect working condition. Several
changes were made in the spinning and
yarn departments. At present the mill is
turning out from 10,000 to 11,000 bags per
day and no great efforts are being made to
secure speed in that direction. There are
about 1370 bales of jute on hand and 5000
more are coming. The manufactured
bags on hand reach about 2,961,000, and
many inquiries are being made for this
clays of goods. These are exclusive of
197,000 sugar bags sold and awaiting ship
ment.
The prison is now more free from petty
disorders than for a long time past. The
recent transfer of disorderly convicts to
the rock quarries at Folsorn prison has
had a beneficial effect upon those left be
hind.
Of iatethe Warden has been punishing
disorderly prisoners by shaving off their
beards and mustaches, the same as when
they enter the prison, in addition to the
usual punishment of solitary confinement
in the dungeons, ball and chain, forleit of
credits, etc. The forfeiture of their facial
adornments has caused the convicts to be
more careful in their deportment. With
the loss of their mustaches they also for
feit the privilege of writing to their rela
tives for three months.
In discussing a case where credits were
forfeited by a prisoner, the Warden said
that as the holidays approach extra care
has to be exercised to prevent outsiders
from smuggling money within the prison
walls. One case in particular recently at
tracted his attention. A pair of slippers
was sent to a prisoner from New York. It
turned out that the heel of each slipper
was hollow and filled with money, a part
of which was found on the convict.
Not Kramer & Petersen.
The warrant issued on Friday for the arrest
of t. S. Adams on a charge of obtaining money
under false pretenses wa3 not issued on the
complaint of Kramer & Petorsen, proprietors
of tne California House, 62b' California street.
S
MISS CORA MACY, Who Is to Marry A. J. McCormick.
LETTER-BOXES RAIDED.
Capture of a Man in the Very
Act of Trying to Abstract
Mail.
Ha Is Supposed to Have Been Engaged
in a Schema of Systematic
Spoliation.
For some time past complaints have
been made to the postal authorities by
downtown merchants chat their hallway
letter-boxes were being tampered with.
In several cases letters were reported
missing that contained money orders, and
an investigation disclosed three of these
money orders which had evidently been
forged by the same hand, though the
payee was different in each case.
These numerous irregularities proved a
sore puzzle to the Postoffice inspectors un
til last Wednesday, when F. B. Oliver of
the firm of F. B. Oliver & Co. tiled a com
plaint with them. With this as a basis of
operation Inspector J. W. Erwin laid out
a plan for the detection and capture of the
culprit. As a result Simon Bendit is now
in jail charged with illegally opening let
ters addressed to another. .
On Wednesday morning about 11:30
JT. B. Oliver left his office, and as he way
going out noticed two tetters in bis box in
the hallway. One of these he noted par
ticularly, as it was from his wife. He re
turned half an hour later, and seeing no
letters in the box asked his clerk for his
mail. . He was informed, much to his sur
prise, that there was none.
He at once notified the postal authori
ties and the matter was placed in the
hands of Mr. Erwin. -
The latter prepared two decoy letters on
Thursday and placed them in Oliver's box.
One of his assistants was place! on guard.
This gentleman, however, left â his post at
noon for lunch, and when he returned one
of the letters was gone. The next day two
new decoys were dropped in Oliver's box,
and at noon the former waicner was re
lieved by Mr. McCormack. Mr. MnCor
mack was not on duty long before he . saw
a man enter the hallway in which Oliver's
box, with a number of others, was located,
return to the doorway, look carefully up
and down the street, close the glass .door
leading into the street and then begin
fishing in the boxes with a split stick. Mr.
McCormack without further delay rushed
across the street from his station and was
in time to see his man drop the stick. Mc-
Cormack | picked up the stick and placed
the suspect under arrest, though he had
not succeeded, in abstracting any letters.
The prisoner proved to be Simon Bendit,
who in August, 1894, had; been arrested,
tried and convicted of forgery and sen
tenced to five years' imprisonment. * He
succeeded, however, in getting a new trial,
in wiiich tb.e jury disagreed, and on March I
20 of this year he was released, alter being
confined in the County Jail for about one
and a half years.
When Bendit was brought before In
spector Erwin on Friday he had a package
of about a dozen pairs of ladies' gloves in
his hand. He explained that tuey had
been intrusted to him by: a drummer
named Smith to take to Nathan Goldtree,
his uncle. An investigation disclosed the
fact that the gloves had evidently been re*
turned by mail as damaged, to Stein heritor
& Kalisher and taken from thai firm's box
by thai prisoner. â¢/ â â â¢> .' ' .'v â ". '
- He was examined before Commissioner
Heacock yesterday, in default of $1000
bail was returned to the County Jail to
await a hearing on Tuesday.
The authorities believe they have the
man who has been causing such serious
inconvenience to the ' merchants by sys
tematically raiding their letter-boxes.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1896.
THE ROMANCE
OF A PICTURE
And How Two Fond Hearts
Were Affected by a
Photograph.
A. J. McCormick 131 3 to Marry
Cora Macy of the Vassar
Quartet.
A San Francisco Business Man Meets
His Fate in a Young Variety
Actress. >.
Philosophers say that on little things
oft en depend the fate of a lifetime, and a
story which has just come to light about
a fair variety actress and a local business
man shows that sometimes two lifetimes
are similarly affected.
The heroine of tbe story is Miss Cora
Macy, late of tbe Vassar Quartet, and the
hero is A. J. McCormick, the manager of
a department in the Crocker business
house on Post street. The little thing
which has affected their lives is a picture
published some weeks ago in The Sundat
Call, but the result of that picture has
been that Mr. McCormick is about to lead
Miss Macy to the altar.
S range to say, it was not Miss Macy 's
picture that appeared in the paper, but
iliat of one of the same "team, as they
say in variety parlance, and thereby hangs
a tale.
The Vassar Quartet consisted, for it ex
ists no longer, of Miss Cora Macy, Miss
JoÃie Intropedi, Miss Blanche Chapman
and Jo Sturgis. Jo was the manager of
the "team" and he always showed a
strong penchant for having things his
own way. He was thoroughly imbued
with the idea that of, all the fair singers
Blanche Cuapman was the only one that
merited the name of a star, and his fiat
had gone forth that only Miss Chapman
should be pictured by the press.
In blissful ignorance of this invidious
| distinction made by the manager, the Or
pbeum sent an attractive photograph of
Miss Josie Intropedi to The Call several
days before the Vassar Quartet arrived
from the East. The first thing Sturgis
saw, on taking up the paper on the morn
ing after his arrival, was the picture of
Miss IntropeJi. "Aha!" he said, "this
girl has been sending on her picture, she
imagines "he is our star, I will show her
she is not, :> and he went down like a
cyclone to the management, and gave
tLiem a piece of his mmd, which shook
the ; lucid calm of the management to its
foundations.
As a sop to Cerberus the management
promised Sturgis to move heaven and
earth to get Miss Chapman's picture in the
paper next week, but as the days pro
gressed every one decided that Miss M*acy
would make a prettier picture, and toward
the middle of the week the press agent ab
stracted Miss Macy's picture by stealth
from its p. ace in the case, where it hung
among the other vaudeville stars, and
tried to brave himself to give that for
publication.
The absence of the picture was at once
detected by the vigilant Sturgis, and he
raised such trouble about it that the man
agement decided that henceforth the Vas
sar Quartet should go pictureless as far as
it was concerned. Cora Macy and Josie
Intropedi never heard the end of the pic
ture grievance, though. There were
wranglings and jealousies and bickerings
about it every day, and at last, after the
"team" had played out its engagement
here and had gone to Los Angeles, the
mutual indignation which had first been
engendered by the publication of the pic
ture reached such a pitch that the mem
bers oi the Vassar Quartet could no longer
appear on the same stage in harmony.
Sturgis shook the dust of Los Angeles
off his feet, declaring that he no longer
wanted to be manager for a team which
defied him in the matter of getting pic
tures in the papers. Cora Macy and Josie
Intropedi replied tearfully that they had
nothing to do with it, but they were nev
ertheless left in Los Angeles to shift for
themselves, with nothing to tml back on
but a little ready money and their ward
robes. In this dilemma they made up
their minds to return to San Francisco
and rehearse a new act as the Vassar duet.
Directly after their return here Miss
Cora Macy met A. J. McCormick, to
whom she had been introduced during the
days of theVasaar Quartet. The acquaint
ance which had been interrupted by the
tour to Los Angeles was renewed with
such ardor on the gentleman's part that
the paÂ»r are now engaged and will shortly
be married.
Miss Cora Macy says that if it had not
been for the picture there never would
have been trouble in the Vassar Quartet,
and if there had not been trouble the
quartet would have gone East ironi Los
Angeles, and if it had gone East she
would not have met A. J. McCor
mick aeain, which is equivalent to saying
that she is about to be married, entirely
on account of tie picture.
Miss Joale IntropeUi has joined the
Tivoli forces, and will appear in "JacK and
the Beanstalk."
For Christmas.
The following appeal is self-explanatory:
The seventy-two children gathered together
in the San Francisco Nursery for Homeless
Children again appeal to the generosity af
their many friends and ask their assistance to
make joyous the coming Christmas holidays.
Donations of money, bedding, clotbiug, tood
or gifts for the Christmas-tree will be most
gratefully received at 2118 Pacific avenue, or
at the nursery, 570 Harrison street, any time
before noon December 24, 1896. The nursery
receives, shelters and maintains all aban
doned children, regardless of sex, nationality
or religion. Respectfully yours, Susie Wells,
2118 Pacific avenue, president Girls' Auxili
ary. P. S.â All donations should be marked
with the name and address of the donor, in
order that they may receive proper acknowl
edgment.
SENATOR LUCHSINGER.
He Says That Economy Will Be the
Keynote at the Coming feeasion of
the Legislature.
J. J. Luchsinger, Republican State
Senator-elect from Solano County, came
down from Vallejo last evening on a
business trip. Incidentally he spoke of
the work that was in band for the next
Legislature.
He reports that the sentiment of the
people of the interior is in favor of a more
economical administration of the State
and county governments, and their repre
sentatives in the Senate and the Assem
bly will be asked to introduce bills or
amendments for the purpose of bringing
about that desirable condition of affairs.
The agriculturists of California are not
the only ones who have suffered by the
stress of falling prices during the past
year. The storekeepers, mechanics and
artisans in the interior have suffered
equally with them, and as their incomes,
precarious at best, nave been scaled down,
they think it no more than right that
State and county officers should be scaled
down also and that taxes should be de
creased in every possible way.
The next thing in importance before the
coming session will be the adoption of a
new primary election law. The wrang
lings, the ballot-box stuffing and other
diseraceful episodes of primary elections
must be done away with. It is proposed
to have all parties hold their primaries on
the same day ana in the same booths
and ail the names of the delegates or can
didates be voted for on one ballot, just as
at a regular election.
Several Californian inventions of voting
machines will be examined by the mem
bers with an idea of adopting a simple and
comparatively inexpensive one.
CALIFORNIA SALMON EGGS.
Twenty-Six Millions Being Exported
From Battle Creek Station.
The United States Fish Commission's
new station at Battle Creek, Tohama
County, will close this week for the sea
son, after having proved itself the most
successful salmon-producing station ever
established by the Government The out
put of e<;gs is 100 per cent greater than
that of any other station. This week and
next week it will have shipped East, to
Europe and to different places on thin
coast 26,000.000 Sacramento River salmon
eggs. Ti:e United States Fish Commission
car No. 3 is now on its way east with
5,000,000 of these eggs, to be hatched and
planted in the Susquehannn and Hudson
rivers and the different New England
rivers tributary to the Atlantic, the inten
tion of the Nat'onal commission being to
make a determined effort to grow Sacra
mento River salmon in Atlantic waters.
The same car also carried a case contain
ing 100,000 eggs that are to be forwarded
to the French Government and hatched
at one of its stations on the river Seine,
and another case containing 50.000 eggs
consigned to the German Government.
Thii week the commission will forward
3,000,000 eggs from Battle Creek station
to Clackumas station, in Oregon; 2.000,000
more to the United States Fish Commis
sion's station at Baird, Cal, and 15,000,000
to the California Fish Commission's sta
tion at Sisson.
The commission confidently claims that

FOR WESTMINSTER CHURCH.
Dramatic and Musical Kecital to Be
Given Next Tuesday.
There will be a grand dramatic and mu
sical recital at the Young Men's Christian
Association auditorium next Tuesday
evening for the benefit of the new Presby
terian church, on the corner of Page and
Webster streets.
The feature will be a dramatic reading
by Elizabeth Strong Worthington, who
will give the thrilling story of "Reuben
Heath" in three parts. The story is full of
dramatic interest and is specially adapted
to elicit all the genius of the elocutionist.
Her faculty in delineating the humorous
side of nuriian nature will be demonstrated
in her reading of "Aunt Mehaiay and the
Britishers."
Mrs. Worthington will be assisted by the
California Quartet, Miss E !a McCloskey,
soloist, and Miss Hattie Lenore, pianist.
All in all, a specially attractive entertain
ment is looked lor.
The affair has been arranged by the la
dies of the church, led by Mrs. C. S. Capp,
Mm. R. B. Milroy and Mrs. E. L. Fisher.
A LONELY SPOT TO DIE.
Jamei Gill Found at Bakers Beach
Suffering; From Knife Wound*.
The employes of the life-saving station
at Bakers beach found an old man on Fri
day, in the brudh near the station, suffer
ing from six jagged knife wounds iv the
neck and two in the left wrist. He had
evidently attempted suicide, his intention
being to sever the jugular vein.
When taken to the Receiving Hospital
he gave his name as James Gill and his
place of residence 3C06 Steiner street. His
wounds were dressed by Doctors Weil and
Bunnell.
Although it was obvious that the old
man had attempted suicide from illness
and despondency he persisted in his state*
ment that another man had done the
cutting and then placed the knife in bia
left hand, leaving him to die.
Arrented for Burglary.
George Moore was arrested Friday morn-
Ing on complaint of Thomas Daly, who resides
on Sixth street, and booked at the Southern
police station on a charge of burglary. Daly
alleges that Moore entered his room and stole
a package of clothing, an alarm clock and sev
eral trinkets of little value- When Moore was
arrested the stolen property was found in his
possession, which will be used as evidence
against him.

HAMEL'S APPEAL
WAS TO DEATH
Dissatisfied With a Court's
Decison He Took
His Life.
Romantic Agreement Which
Was Not Good at
Law.
Despondent at the Prcspective Loss of
His Property He Turned
On the Gas.
Joseph Hamel, aged 58, committed snicide
at his residence, 3422 Eighteenth street,
Friday night. Judge Seawell recently de
cided a suit adversely to Hamel, and it is
undoubtedly this fact which caused his
despondency.
The suit disclosed a romantic story.
For years Hamel and Miss Margaret
Buc&master had lived together. On her
death she left all her properly by deed of
gift to Hamel. Her brother, John Buck*
master, sought to have the deed annulled.
According to the plaintiff Hamel had
used artifices of all kinds, including drugs
calculated to affect the mind, to mold
Miss Buckmaster to his wili in the dis
position of her property. This Hamel
denied. The case was in charge of At
torney Nowlin, the amount involved being
about $6000.
"We had been friends from childhood,"
said Joseph Hamel in speaking of Mar
garet Buckmaster, "and as. years went by
and it seemed that neither of as was likely
to wed we agreed to live together as brother
and sister, and we did. 1 '
Such was the testimony which Joseph
Hamel gave before Judge Seawell in an
action brought by John Buckmaster, a
brother of Margaret, to have a deed in
wTiich his deceased sister had granted all
her earthly effects to Hamel set aside.
Judee Seawell evidently did not con
sider the agreement sufficient considera
tion and he sustained the action.
By the terms of the agreement under
which Miss Buckmaster and Hamel dwelt
under the same roof, each was to bequeath
to the other all property of which he or she
was possessed at the time of death and
the survivor was to pay all funeral ex
penses. Hamel lived up to the latter por
tion of the agreement as Miss Buckmaster
had to tbe former.
He paid the funeral expenses of his
friend and caused a monument to be
erected over her grave. The decision of
Judge Seawall gave him little hope of re
imbursement and liifi title to the house in
Which he lived was destroyed. He had a
little other property, a house and Jot on
Mission street, but not of sufficient value
to Keep him in comfortable circumstances.
He was alone and he could see but one
refugeâ death.
The means by which he ended his life
were the same as the deadly agency in the
double tragedy of the day before. He in
dited a long, rambling letter, setting
forth the details of his troubles, to bis
sister, Mrs. Frank Langan of Gold Hill,
Nev.
Then, without lying upon the bed or re
moving any of his coining, he turned on

ATHLETICS IK THE ARMY.
Preparation* for a Great field Day at
the Presidio. (
Athletic contests in the army are becom
ing popular and engaging alike the atten
tion of commissioned officers and enlisted
men. The recent athletic sports at the
Presidio, in which the Third Artillery and
First Infantry contended for honors and
prizes, stimulated so much interest in
army circles that steps have been taken to
provide a contest in which all the troops
in the Department of California may par
ticipate.
At army headquarters in the Phelan
building to-morrow afternoon a board of
officers will convene to consider tbe sub
ject. The officers composing the board
are: Captain James S. Pet tit, First Infan
try; First Lieutenant John M. Neall,
Fourth Cavalry; First Lieutenant R. C.
Croxton, First Infantry, and First Lieu
tenants Eugene T. Wilson and William G.
H.ian, Third Artillery.
The order concerning the board ema
nates from General Forsytn, the depart
ment commander. Measures will be taken
to procure prizes of a character to invite
active competition. The board will prob
ably hold sessions for several days, and
devise a thorough programme for contests
on the Presidio field.
The co-operation of public-spirited citi
zens of San Francisco, especially in tbe
work of providing prizes, will be wel
comed. It is understood that cash prizes
will not be offered, bat articles for the
adornment of company quarters, or
trophies which may be defended by or
ganizations, will be acceptable.

(g; !; Also Been Suspended for Playing Wheel
'%::â  barrow at Midnight.
HIS CERTIFICATE TO BE
WITHHELD TILL JULY
RqstiU of the Investigation of
the City and County Hos
pital Scandal
OTHER CHANGES WILL BE MADE
IF NEED BE.
No Successor to Dr. Stab, c Has Been
Decided Uponâ Tne Training
School May Go.
The Board of Health has begun its work
of turning the City and County Hospital
"jtjiside down," as one of the members of
tt: board a short time ago said it
J .id do.
'l he worfc has been very quietly begun
b--;iind closed doers and will be as quietly
continued, but it would appear that it is
. >:^e the less thorough.
It has been decided to allow Dr. Stahle
JO rejiign his office as Superintendent.
iTr. Gunn, the interne who tried to play
&t the game of wheelbarrow with one of
nurses up and down tne main corridor of
â¢..e hospital after midnight of November
.7; lias been suspended, and will not be
gjyÂ«n the certificate until next July that
Otherwise would have been his with the
cosepf this month.
.A 3 :*9 r xiie four nurses who were parties
tÂ«.fne rrridnight frolic, they have been
suVpeo'ded under graduated sentences â
â  so as to fit the crime. The least
will be allowed to return to her
.- â iti one month, the next in degree of
friiiH^Kifl do the same a month later, or
f.vo months hence; the third is under
t pienbe for three months and the fourth,
. rieaamably the wheelbarrow in the case,
Tv'ilj.find the doors of the hospital closed
.^t- for four months.
Ttrlfc.say tne members of the board, is
tlief.iiegrun.tng of the changes to be made
as Â«-".continued inquiry may discover the
need; The board proposes to look into
tiiji methods and conduct of the hospital
thbedughty, and whatever changes may be
d^emÃd; necessary to bring about a proper
aftd successful regime at the hospital will
certainly be made.
T be successor of Dr. Stahle has not been
deter'minea upon, at least if he has the
bOardJieeps the fact to itself. The mem
bers say that no superintendent will be
navijed' for some time.
ltis.aUogether likely that a movement
vi.l be started that will shortly dispense
:her with the training-school for
nurbes attached to tha City and County
Hoipital.
A short time ago Dr. Morse was the
"ynJy member of the board who was directly
eppoaed to the school as conducted ttiere.
He. insisted that the wards or charges of
the City â the indigent sick wno were
taken thereâ had the same right to ex
perienced nursing that the patients of
other hospitals were eiven ; that the City
was rebporisible lor their care and was cer
tainly rich enough to provide it.
The other members are rather disposed
to take this view of it since the escapade
of the night of November 27 and the de
velopments that have followed on the
heels of the inauiry that it provoked.
"A bevy of very young women who may
hope 10 be nurses and a corps of very
young men thrown together in the loose
fashion that seems to prevail out there
are pretty certain to frolic, and that won't
a\o in any public institution, especially a
hospital," said one of the members yes
terday.
"That story about Miss Patton, the head
nurse, smoking cigarettes and that sort of
thing is so absurd on its face that tt
ECtfrcely needs denying," said Dr. Fi:zgib
bon. "There is nothing in the conduct of
the head nurse tbat lays her open to cen
sure at the hands of the board."
ROPUS CHOATE.
He Stood Easily at the Head of All the
â¢C": Forensic Speakers of Hia Day.
Again, Mr. Choate was an oratorâ and
Hn orator with a range scarcely paralleled
in our conn try. He stood easily at the head
of all forensic speakers against whpra he
tvas pitted. He held the breathless atten
tion of a Senate where lingered the echoes
of Weoster's voice, and where Clay and
1 Calhoun were still to be heard ; and he was
jrika first-rate favorite on the platform of the
onvention and the lyceum ata time when
hath teemed with fascinating and instruc
tive speakers. To occupy a first-class rank
in three such highly specialized lines of ora
tory is rare indeed; yet no one eyer dis
puted Mr. Choate's right to that position.
Before Mr. Webster bad been dead nine
montha Mr. Cboate delivered bis eulogy
at Dartmouth College, and Mr. Everett,
speaking of the oration in the next month,
called the orator "our matchless Choate,
who Has just electrified the land with a
burst of eloquence not easily to be par
alleled in the line of time." Founding
his oratory upon the solid base of pro
found learning, whether in law, in govern
ment or in literature, be kindled the mass
of all these acquisitions by his rhetorical
p eniu3 into a consuming heat and a daz
zling light all bis own. ...
Mr. Choate's oratory was distinguished
for an intense richness and exuberance of
language, caught in no slight measure
from his favorite Cicero. Tnis sometimes
makes bis speeches difficult to read; the
overflowing sentences are too long, the
teeniiug fancy, the bounteous illustration
Ver e,s on the grotesque. But they were
meant for the hour, to t>e heard, not read;
and two things carried off every vestige of
tedium or incongruiiy. First, Mr. Choate a
personal at pearance on every occasion
was bo striking tbat it held the attention
of bis auditors with an influence that was
magical. Of other distiuguished orators,
William Pinkney was famous, as was
Krskine in England for the extreme,
aJmost foppish, elegance and splendor
of bis appearance; Henry Clay presented
4 singular combination of features,
tfcc most uncouth that could easily be
imagined, with a gallantry of delivery and
magnetism of tone that generally cap
tivated any new hearers, but mingled wnfi
a great iniperiousness and defiance tbat
made not a few enemies in the Senate.
Sergeant 8. Prentiss, second to no Ameri
can, speaker in bis amazing power of
â rousing enthusiasm, offered at the outset
a presence as insignificant as St. Paul's.
Mr. 'Webster's niasÃive stature and deep- 1
set eyes are familiar to all, though the
slow manner and ponderous diction of
later years belonged to the days of his
greatest triumphs. But the power of Mr.
Cboate's look and manner was something
of a different order. His shock of raven
hair, his wildly flashing eye. his paunt
frame, his sallow cheek, his restless action
and, above all, his strangely musical voice
and rhytnmical delivery, arrested and heid
attention in an uncanny, a witchlike
manner, une.-mhly in every note, look and
movement â New Enelanu Magazine.
AMERIOAN SOCIETY.
Mr. H. L. Godkiit Sayg That TVa Have
Very Little of It.
We have no great landholders and there
is no popular recognition of the fact that
a great land-owner or great man of any
sort needs a great house, says E. L. God
kin in Scribner's. In the second place,
we have no capital to draw on for a large
company of men and women who will
amuse each other in a social way, even
from Friday to Monday. The absence of
anything we can call societyâ that is, the
REV. C 17 HENNING,
union of wealth and culture in the same
persons â in all the large American cities,
except possibly Boston, is one of the
marked and remarkable features of our
time. It is, therefore, naturally what one
might expect, that we rarely hear of
Americans figuring in cultivated circles in
England. Those who go there with so
cial aspirations desire most to get into
what is called the Prince of Wales' set, in
vfchich their national peculiarities furnish
great amusement among a class of people
to whom amusement is the main thing.
It would b- easy enough to fill forty or
fifty rooms from Friday to Monday in a
house near New York or Boston. But
what kind of company would it be? How
many of the gnests would have anything
to say to each otner? Suppose stocks to
be ruled ont, where would the topics of
conversation be found? Would tnera be
much to talk about except the size of tne
host's fortune!and that of some other per
sons present? How many of the men
would wish to sit with the ladies in the
evening and participate with them in
conversation? Would the host attempt
two such gatherings without abandoning
his efforts in disgust, helling out the whole
concern and going to Europe?
THE OLD SQUISE'S SCHEME.
Why His Projected '-Coup" on the
Bscetrack Did Not Couuect.
Old Squire Workem had b6en going
about several days buried in deep thought
and having as little as possible to say,
says the Detroit Free Press. There had
been no profit in the grains, fruits or
stock that he had raised. He could get
nothing out of thofÂ«e who owed him, for
they had been squeezed dry. He had
plenty, but it had always been the pas
sion of his life to get more. Finally he
sent for Link Perkins, a shiftless but
shifty Yankee, to whom the squire never
spoke.
â¢'Link," began the squire, "do you read
the papers?"
"Jist the sportin' news mostly, sir.'
"PrecmHy. Then you know what a
coup ii. You must have read how a few
fellows down in Mexico cleaned up $250,
-000 and later how another gang found
$25,000 at Chicago, all by working thiÂ«
coup business, understand."
"Yes, I heerd all about it 'Twar slick
business."
"Well, Link, knowing thatyou can keep
your mouth shut I propose that you and I
work a coup. That brown filly of mine
can outrun anything in this part of the
State. They all know her, but I want you
to disguise her some way, take her down
into Hackaway County as a new one and
back her for all the money you can get
against her. I'll furnish the money, but
must not be known in the matter. "YVnat
do you think of it?"
"Thar'o a fortune in it, squire. We Kin
break the Hackaway crowd an' they'll
never know bow 'twar done."
The race came off and Link bad a barrel
ofthe squire's money on the fiiiy that her
owner wouid not have known. She started
like a shot out ot a gun, but after a few
iumpa bolted for home, took the fence
like a hunted stag, left her rider in a tam
arack swamp and reached the station in a
broiten-down condition.
Link never showed up, simply because
be had worked the coup so as to provide
liberally for hisown future. All the squire
did was to prepare a bill for the next Leg
islature making it a penal offense to even
attempt a coup on a racetracfi.

of one general shape, two stories high,
and are put together by a curious method

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1896.
FOR NO SECT, BUT
FOR ALL IN NEED
Rev. C. W. Henning to
Start a Novel Institu
tional Church.
He Disclaims Any Formal In
novation and Declares for a
Basis of Union.
Something; About the Gentleman Who
Will Next Werk Start His Re
ligious M:v:ment.
Key. C. W. Henning, who is well known
throughout the State in Methodist and
Congregational circles, has decided to
start what is tantamount to an institu
tional church. The main objects of the
movement are embodied in the following
card:
BASIS OF rUION.
We whose names are attached hereto, de
sirous of uniting all the forces that make for
righteousness, and recogr.iziner in the teach
ing of Jesus of NnzÃreth a .sufficient guide in
the regeneration of the individual, of society
and of the state, do agree upon this simple
basis of union, and cordially Invite all who
will accept his teaching to unite with us in
such studies and practical measures as this as
sociation may elect, in accordance with its by
laws, to promote and extend the kingdom of
God on earth.
Provided, always and particularly, that no
article of belief other than that above indi
cated, or that will conflict with the creed of
any evangelicsl church, shall be imposed
upon any uniting with us.
Upon this basis of union, we pledge our
selves to teach and practice personal self
denial and mutual helpfulness to the end that
justice, truth and mercy may be established
in the earth, and that the divine right of every
member of society to life, liberty and the pur
suit of happiness may be secured by our insti
tutions and laws.
Regular meetings at Washington Hall, 35
Eddy street (opposite Tivoli Theater), every
Sunday at 11 a. m. and 7 :30 p. m. Rev. C. W.
Henning, lecturer, 1012 Wood street, Oak
land.
In further explanation of the project
Rev. Mr. Henning said yesterday:
"We have already interested some
thirty or forty people in the movement
and have secured means to insure its be
ing carried on financially.
"The work of the organization will be
threefold â educational, reiormatory and
in relief. T. c educational means include
a reading-room, library and course of lec
tures, the reformatory work will em
brace a home for helpless girls at nominal
cost, and relief plans comprise visiting the
sick aud prisoners and looking after those
in distress. There will be no pecuniary
obligation required from those who unite
with us, though all will be expected* to
coniribute according to their means.
"There will be the freest possiblediscus
slon of all questions, economic, secular
and religious. Every Sunday we propose
having lectures, to include a public con
gress on some subject to be announced a
week ahead, upon which the people will
be invited to write papers of a certain
length.
"We intend to begin work a week from
to-morrow, when our objects will be more
fully explained and a sermon will be
preached on 'Who is Jesus?' "
Hey. C. W. Henning came to California
in 1861. graduated in the Catholic college
at Santa Clara in 1863. was admitted to
the California M. E. Conference in the

for four years and took charge of the Daily
Times there from 1889-90, when he went

took charge of the Second Congregational
Church in Oakland from 1892-93. He
has resided in Southern California until
last October.
He began his present line of work as a
specialty in Kansas City in 1886, when he
started a mission where over 2000 con
verts from intemperance were claimed.
He gave many meais, much employment
and found much employment for many,
he says. He states that he was the mov
ing spirit of the "exodus committee" in
Kansas in 1879-80, when he heloed to
colonize about 50,000 colored people. He
tried a similar work to that now proposed
hew in Oakland, but says that it failed
owing to lack of his personal supervision.
His plan, he siys, comes under the
head of "socialist reform" work, after Dr.
Heron's school of "applied Christianity,"
and does not propose to interfere with any
society work of a beneficial character.
The Deafness ot White Cats.
"Though I had often heard of it I never
waÂ« fully fatistied that all white cat* are
naturally deaf until recently," said a sci
entific gentleman, who devotes considera
ble of his time to experimenting with the
lower order of animals. "I was aware
that Professor Bell in his original experi
ments in connection with the telephone
had ascertained and stated that his expe
rience with white cats were that they were
all either deaf or very deficient in hear
ing, and that other experimenters in the
same direction had reached similar con
clusions. To satisfy myself I recently â¢se
cured in all twenty-three white cats and
experimented ou all of them, one at a
time.
"In every case 1 found them stone deaf.
In carrying the experiment further I
found that white dogs and white borse3
are deficient in hearing, and tuat many
of them are entirely deaf. So are white
rats and white mice. 1 am confident
I do not overstate it in regard to white
cats, though 1 have only personally expe
rimented with twenty-three, and, of
course, can only speak positively in regard
to tnem. I don't hazard much, however,
when I make the bold statement that all
white cats are deaf." â AVashington Star.
NEW YORK'S EGG TRADE.
Special Men Employed by the Big Deals
â¢rs as Tenters.
The egg industry, while a very extensive
one, is not a very lucrative one, at least
here in this city. The commission mer
chants say tl.at there is little profit to the
shipper and very often the investment re
sults in an actual loss.
However flimsy the pretext ma 7 be, the
commission merchants maintain that.egsrs
in themselves are not profitable, but tbat
it behooves them as dealers in country
produce to sell them. They say that their
largest source of revenue is from other
food stuffs.
On April 28 there were received in New
York city 9758 thirty-dozen cases of eges.
For the six days prior to and inclusive of
that date 11,183 thirty-dozen cases of egg 3
were received. Twelve days previous to
April 28, for a period of six days, 86,321
cases of eggs were received.
The quality of the ejigs is irregular. The
largest dealer of eggs in the world, in this
city, estimated that between 9000 and
10,000 30-dozen oases of eggs were used
daily by New Yorkers in the spring.
These 9000 30 dozen cases of eggs repre
sent 1,240,000 eggs, an average of less than
one egg to each inhabitant. In the sum
mer the eggs are harder to keep fresh and
are not used to so great an extent.
The greatest sources of supply for the
New York market are New Jer-ey, East
Pennsylvania and New York. The Easter
trade in eggs is always good in New York
and the eggs command fancy prices.
A small t ader on the east side who
deals exclusively in "prime to middlings"
and "seconds" has a very misleading
sign in front of the store in the spring. It
reads:
: FRESH LAID EGGS :
: '.-'. 24 FOR 25 CENTS. :
; ORDERS FILLED :
â¢ WHILE YuU WAIT. :
There is no hennery attached to the
store, and it is doubtful if even a coop can
be found. . , . , .
The testing of eggs is very interesting.
One farm on Dey street employs forty men
whose sole occupation is to test eggs.
The rooms are darkened, and the . men,
seated by their baskets of eggs and recep
tacles for bad eggs, test the eggs by means
of lighted candles.
The experts nimbly take up -a half
dozen of eggs at a time and hold them
to the light. If the egg is clear, it
is all right; if dark or cloudy, ,it .is
spoikd. In the summer reason some ex
pert "handlers" or "testers" asseverate
that they have seen full grown chickens,
and they do not believe in Rontgen rays
either.â -New York Evening Sun. ,; x-;~
BARONESS BURDETT-COUTTS.
The Old Home Where Many Interest
ing iÂ£Tenta Havte Taken Place.
At the chief entrance to Holly Lodge,
Lady Burdett-Coutts' country home on
the northern heights of London, there is
a relic of Mrs. Coutts, its former owner,
whose fancy caused a horseshoe to be
nailed on the threshold, says the London
Mail. In the wide entrance hall, now
thronged with well-dressed guests, hang
rare old portraits, engraved and in mezzo
tint. Many of the c are interesting,
historically, to the family.
Hoily Lodge has been the scene of many
interesting iestivities and entertainments.
Its close proximity to London makes it a
convenient rendezvous for the statesmen,
churchmen, artists, litterateurs, Boldiers,
travelers and scholars who are proud to
call its owner friend.

The query is best answered by the Baron
ess' many charitable schemes.
It was mainly due to her unceasing de
votion that the bill was passed in 1889
which po materially improved the condi
tion of the little ones. Further efforts
were crowned by her work in establishing
the National Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children, the first meeting tak
ing place in the Baroness' own pretty
drawing-room.
The name of this society reminds us of
another which the "Good Baroness" was
mainly instrumental in founding, for the
prevention of cruelty to animals.
The Baroness is tall and thin and very

CATHOLIC COLLEGE MATCH
Santa Clara Overwhelms St. Mary's,
Forty-Six to Four.
For the first time in their history old
Santa Clara College and St. Mary's Col
lege have met on a gridiron field to contest
practically for the Calbohc intercollegiate
championship of the Pacific Coast. The
matcn was played yesterday in a driving
rain and on a muddy, slimy field at Cen
tral Park, and Santa Clara College, with
the first football team it has ever sent out,
won handily by the overwhelming score of
46 to 4.
The play of the representatives of the
pioneer college was of a high order and
was surprising to the confident Bt. Mary's
collegians and to the wildly enthusiastic
partisans of both elevens because of the
fact that the wearers of the red and white
from down the bay had been looked upon
only as possible dark horses against the
more experienced Oakland collegians.
Their showing was to be compared with
the unexpected result of the first great
interuniversity match when Stanford
defeated California.
In team work and in exceptionally well
executed interference Santa Clara College
completely outclassed the St. Mary's
team, which was fairly outplayed every
where.
With the exception of one touchdown,
scored early in the game on a chance in
stantly seized for a long run, St. Mary's
College never at any time menaced Santa
Clara * goal.
Santa Clara gained repeatedly on bucks
between Butler and Taylor and round
Brignole, St. Mary's other tackle. She
had no more cause to use end runs than
did Stanford on Thanksgiving, as the op
posing line could not withstand the ma
chine-like ranid plunges of Briue, Conlan
and King. Bride distinguished himself
by kicking seven out of eight goals with a
sopgy oall.
It should be said, however, in justice to
St. Mary's team, that it played a plucky
game all the time in the face of certain
defeat and against a heavier and a better
trained lot of men. St. Mary's College
captain after the game said tat he is not
in the least disheartened, but that his
men are det rmined to see their college
put forth an eleven next year that shall
follow in tufl lootsteps of the St. Mary's
College baseball players, who have always
been the victors over Santa Clara.
In the sheltered grand stand seats sat
the brass bands of both colleges and
poured out volumes of furious melody in
their efforts to outplay eacu other.
Just how the game went and who did
the playing may be seen Dy consulting
the accompanying accurate chart of the
play.

ACADEMIC CHAMPIONS.
San Mateo Outclasses Oakland
High School 26 to O.
Bt. Matthew's Hall football team became
champions of the State Academic League
yesterday by defeating the Oakland High
School at the Presidio athletic grounds by
a score of 26 to 0.
The team play and interference of St.
Matthew's was admirable and approached
Varsity form. Porter of Olympic and
â¢â¢Tommy" Code of Stanford and Olympic
were there, jubilant over the showing made
by their pupils. Captain Waiton and the
two Arlett brothers of Reliance and Reno
Hutchinson of Berkeley had done the
coaching for Oakland High.
A great deal of fumbling was done.
Oakland was even more jncertain in
handling the wet ball than was San
Mateo.
When called upon to kick the High
School line was unable to hold St.
Matthew's and the ball was repeatedly
blocked. It was also too light to with
stand the heavy bucking of St. Matthew's,
and allowed repeated gains.
Snitzer and Johnson of St. Matthew's
both made be&utiful runs of 100 and 80
yards ieÂ»pectively.
Over 200 enthusiastic students were
present to cheer on their teams.

STOCKTON PUNS
FOR A SMELTER
Aspires to Be the Entrepot i
of a Neighboring Mm- f
ing Section.
Hcp^s Based on the Construction
of the Sierra Pac fie
Railroad.
Cheap Coa to Be Laid at That City's
Door With n the Next
Ten Days.
Btockton is ambiious to have a smelter,
and that ambition is backed by snch
energy and enterprise that it is likely to
be fulfilled within the next yea--.
P. A. Buell of P. A. Buell <fc Co. of
Stocktun, vice-president of the Sierra Pa
cific Railroad Company, was in the City
yesierday, and in speaking of t.tiÂ« pro
jected railroad discoursed incidentally of
the great benefits that would accrue to
Stockton from its operation. The road is
to have its tidewater terminus at Stock
ton, as it is to be extended forty-five
miles from that city into the mining
region to the northeast. Survey work is
now in progress, actual construction worlc
is expeciea to Degin in about sixty days,
and the road, according to the opinion of
Mr. Buell, will be ready for operation in
about a year. It will be oi standard
gauge.
It will be principally used to carry sup*
plies of all kinds into this heretofore lit
tle developed section, and will brinp ores
ami building material, such as grantto
and limestone, into Stockton.
The ore product of the region consists m
largely of what are known as rebellious â 
ores. These, owing to the difficulty and i
expense of transporting them to a sniel-
Ur, are at present treated with chlorides
'to extract the metal, a process that is con
siderably more 'expensive than that of
smelting.
With the Sierra Pacific Railroad in op
eration convenient and cheap transporta
tion will be available to Stockton. The
region referred to is rich in these rebel
lious ores and it is the purpose of promi
nent and weaitby Stocktonians to erect s
smelter to handle the ores. By this
stroke of enterprise it is expected not
only to control all the trade of the mining
section that will thus be given an outlet
into Stockton, but the anticipation is that
mining will be greatly stimulated by the
facilities which the Stockton people are
now planning to provide.
Work on the Corral Hollow Railroad
and coal mines has now progressed to
such an ex.ent that coal from those mines
will be laid down in quantity in Stockton
within ten days. This will provide cheap
fuel for the smelter and also for other
manufacturing interests, existing and con
templated, in the metropolis of the San
Joaquin, which already rnnks as the sec*
ond manufacturing city in California.
CABLE-CARS COLLIDE.
A Serious Accident arrowly -\vÂ«rte<t
. at Ku'.t-or and Polk Streets.
A Sutter-street cabie-car gome east col
lided with another oar on Po'k; street
shortly before 8 o'clock la>t night and
caused the greatest excitement among the
passeneerp on both car*.
Tne Poik-street car was going north and
the gripman wiic-n he readied the cross
ing went ahead. l(*tnkio|: that the Sutter
street car would stop. The latter, how
ever, came straight i>n and st-uck the
dummy ot' tue Poik-street, car with such,
force as to clerrd! it. The shock threw
several of the passenger* on each'car from
their seat?, but fortunately no one was in
jured as lar as couUi tie learned.
It was lucky that the r:-.in kept away
passengers ;roui sitting on the dummy of
the Po.k-street car otherwise some livei
mi^ht have :>een placed in jeopardy.
The traffic was delaye I for about twenty
minutes tiil the Polk-^treet car wis DUt
back on the rails. A Linte crowd quickly
gatthered as the report spread that several
peop !e had been seriously injured.

There is trouble dire. and deep in the
. Democratic camp. The aristocratic*
wielders of power of the old Democratic
â¢â¢ County Central Committee of Alameda
County, which conducted the campaign
" of 1894, have been sued like ordinary
Vulgar creditors. .'. -
Â°. When Budd was" elected, Aiameda
â¢ County put up a very energetic campaign.
"â¢â¢ I There were lots of people in this county
. ' who had to be provided for, and whose
1 only hope of loaves and fishes lay in the
election of Mr. Budd.

AN IMPOSING MEMORIAL
Daniel Moriarty Erecting the
Largest Burial Monument
on Record.
He Is Anxious to Tasttfy to Gratitude
and Aff.ction in a Befitting
Manner.
OaklaM) Office San Francisco Call.)
908 Broadway, Dec. 12. )
Daniel Moriarty, one of the most
j wealthy residents of Elmhurst, has re-
J ceived plans and descriptions of what will
be, when finished, the largest and most
substantial burial monument in the entire
I country.
Before coming to Alameda County Mr.
Moriarty was a resident of New Orleans
and in that city his first wife died nine
years ago and his father also died there
thirty-eigtit years ago. It is in memory of
these relatives tbat he has decided to erect
the great monument.
Many years ago Daniel Moriarty, a
native of Ireland, came to New Orleans a
mere boy, mid after experiencing some
hard times he was given a position in a
grocery establishment kept by a widow
named Mary Farrell. The lad served in
the store ior several years and finally,
although there was some disparity in their
ages, he married his employer. The busi
ness then grew rapidly under the new
partnership and graduaiJy the lady with
drew from the active management until
the firm finally became Mr. Moriarty.
For- many years they Jived in perfect
contentment and hapriness; the business
increased and was very profitable, but the
death of Mrs. Moriarty broke up the part
nership. After her death Mr. Moriarty,
who had accumulated a very extensive
fortune, abandoned commercial life, and
about six years ago came to this coast.
Some time ago he decided to erect a
monument that would in some measure
show his esteem for his departed relatives.
The plans are now completed and work
has commenced. The monument will be
constructed of Vermont granite, and will
weigh nearly 375 tons. It will require the
services of twenty- two cars to transport
the stone to the cemetery. The largest
single block of granite ever quarried in
that State will be used as the base stone,
and a special car has been built to accom
modate the immense block. The monu
ment will occupy the most prominent po
sition in Metairie Cemetery, and with its
foundation and freight will cost $50,000.
In the rough t c base stone measures
over fifteen feet square and is four feet
thick. The car to carry it cost $1800.
Following the base stone will be two
courses of granite, each composed of a sin
gle atone and weighing about twenty tons.
On theso blocks will rest the die stone.
Tbis feature will measure eight feet in
height by six feet in diameter, the four |
sides being paneled. At each corner of |
tbe diestone there will be a polished
column of granite, with Corinthian capi
tals, and resting on each of these columns
will be a granite statue. These four figures
will cost $2000 each ; the third stone at tbe
base of the monument will be cut with
the word "Moriarty" and the opposite
panel will contain the names and dates oT
the deaths of those whom it commem
orates. *

Mrs. Pletz asserts, her husband married
Emily MacÃnde of Livermore.
Pleiz is a man about 25 years of age and
a paper- hanger by trade, and 'absolutely
refuses to -ay a word about his trouble.
The second Mrs. Pletz came tn Oakland

ani! declared that she would stick by her
husband, and if necessary that Pletz will,
pay the lee for his first wife to get tbe de
cree entered and then marry her over

Mrs. Pietz No. 2 says that her husband
thought the divorce had been granted and
the decree entered, and does not credit
him with any willful culpability.

OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. 12.â An agree
ment was recorded to-day between John

DOES EVOLUIION
EXPLAIN IT ALL?
A Momentous Controversy
Amocg Student Jour
nalists.
Roused by a Paper Written by
a Junior on " The Te.eology
of Darwinism."
Professor How son's Students of Phil
osophy May Yet Taka a Hand
in the battle.
BERKELEY, Cal., Dec. 12.â !l Will the
Darwinian theory account for the origin
of the soul?" is the tremendous issue ot a
controversy between students that has
attracted wide attention in university
circles.
The discussion was started by the pub
lication in the students' monthly maga
zine of a paper written by A. H. Alien
'98 in his English work at college. It was
entitled "The Teleology of Darwinism,"
and was a result of study under Prolessor
Syle of Wallace's "Darwinism."
Allen's paper was replied to in yester
day's issue of the magazine by A. A. Law
son, who boldly challenges the arguments
upon which the other had based the con
clusion that "the psychical and the ani
mal natures 01 man are so radically differ
ent in kind that they cannot De referred
to common origin."
The discussion was at once a general
topic of conversation, as was also a pro
posal by Professor Syle that the philoso
phical department be induced to take a
hand. Allen and Lawson are at outs on the
question of "special creation," the latter
taking the materialistic side, ascribing
Allen's psychic "protest against th
notion of a material origin" of the soul t
babiti of thought inherited from "th
primitive and poorly developed intellect
of our superstitious ancestors."
Professor Syle is now desirous of inter
esting seme one of Professor Howison's
budding philosophers in the momentous
discussion and proposes a review by an
undergraduate member of the Philosophi
cal Union of the arguments of the two
champions already in the field.
Meanwhile the editor of the paper which
is the field of battle is congratulating him
selt on having found a way out of the
difficulties encountered in securing suita
ble literary contributions from students.
There are many who are prepared to
taKe a hand in the Alien-Lawsou discus
sion, which has shown how easily a
subject may be found for student writers.
It is thought that the sensation created
by the controversy may be the means of
starting a boom in college journalism at
Berkeley, which has nÂ»t advanced as
enthusiasts think it should during recent
years. _^___________

She was supported right royally by Mrs.

WATCHING THEIR SAFES
Business Men Receive Warnings
From the Polics De
partment.
Lights to B P aced About Strong
Boxes So Tliat Patrolmen Can
Sse Them Readily.
Chief of Police Crcwley does not Intend
to be caught napping this winter with
an epidemic of safe-cracking on bis hands.
In former years the thieves who make
their living by this line of criminal in
dustry have reaped a rich harvest, and
many wrecked strong boxes have testified
to their prowess. Usually they have made
their hauls and escaped befoie being de
tected, though in a number of cases clever
detective work has rounded them up and
landed them in prison.
Whether or not the Chief has received
an intimation of an intended visit from
the safe-breakers is not known, but he has
issued orders that show that he intends to
be on '.he alert.
Patrolmen in the downtown districts
have been instructed to call on business
men who have safes and request them to
take extra precautions to assist tbe police
in their night vigils. Where safes are
within view of tne doors or windows of
the stores the owners are requested to
have gas jets burning brightly all night,
and if no gas is handy other lights are
asked.
Where safes are in offices and cannot be
readily seen, lights are to be so placed
that the place of ingre?s is plainly visible.
Patrolmen have also been cautioned to
Keep a sharp lookout while on their beats
and scrutinize the interior of stores
thoroughly, wherever the facilities permit,
several times during the night. It is hoped
by these means to prevent a repetition of
robberies that have occurred in former
years. #
Last year very few cracked safes were
reported to the police, and in most in
stances the jobs seemed to be those of
amat urs in the business. In 1894, how
ever, the number of strong boxes broken
into was very large, and for a, period of
several weeks burglaries or cracued safes
werÂ«> of almost daily occurrence.
The thieves, traced by the ruin they left
behind them, seemed to operate in" San
Francisco until the police began to be too
hot on their trail, and then to jump to in
terior towns and rob some stores where no
precautions were taken.
When matters had quieted down in this
City they would return to do a few jobs in
quick succession and then disappear again.
Their favorite mode of opera lion, which
showed them to be experts, was to muffle
the combination handle and break off the
bar that operates tbe interior mechanism
with a sledge or hammer. Then a punch
was placed against the broken end of the
bar and a few heavy blows sent the com
bination into the safe and tbe doors could
be swung open. The opening of the inside
doors, if there were any, was an easy
matter.
The majority of the safes cracked were
small ones, in saloons and offices, where
the combinations were easily wrecked, but
several large robberies were accomplished.
Tents Not Popular.
BERKELEY, Cal., Dec 12.â The new
tents on the university grounds were
brought into general use to-day for exami
nations. The students whose classes met
under the canvas are not disposed to
sing the praises of tents as rainy day
schoolrooms. The heating is by oil stoves,
and the ventilation is very imperfect, so
that "eds" and co-eds alike nope that this
year will be the last of the overcrowding
that maKes such shifts necessary.
Spitting on Sidewalks.
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. 12.â Tbe Board
of Health at its last night's meeting re
quested the City Attorney to draw up an
ordinance making it a misdemeanor to
spit on the sidewalk or in streetcars, pub
lic halls and tueaters.
Some time ago the Alameda Trustees
passed a similar ordinance, but found
great difficulty in enforcing it, but it is
hoped that Oakland will be more suc
cessful.
South. Berkeley Bazaar.

The free reading-room of the library closed
to-night and will not be reopened until the
new quarters are opened in the City Hall. All

HE IS NOT DUNHAM.
Mistake Made by a Deputy Marshal of
Bausalito.
Deputy Marshal Johnson of Sausalito
arrested a man there Friday night, and as
he thong tit he answered the description of
James C. Dunham, the murderer of the
McGrlincy family in San Jose, he detained
him till yesterday afternoon and brought
him to tbe City. He handed him over to
Policeman Dillon of the Harbor police
and Dillon took him to police head
quarters.
Detective Bainbridge had a look at the
man and saw at once that he was not
Dunham. As he seemed to be suffering
from delirium tremens Bainbridge in
structed the policeman to take the man to
the Receiving Hospital. Last night the
man wa- considerably better and was able
to talk intelligently. He said his name
was Charles Coombs, and he was at one
time librarian of the Cooper Medical Col
lege. He had been drinking heavily, but
how be got to Sausalito was a puzzle to
him.

Evidence is beinj; accumulated every
day proving beyond all doubt that Fitz
simmons was robbed of the $10,000 purse
by a gang of sharpers. The testimony
eiven by Trainers Smith and Allen and by
IViiliani Abbott has been yenned in every
detail as to the job by which it was made
to appear thatShartey was suffering from
a foul blow, and as to the reasons why
Hiram Cook, after having been visited by
Manager Lynch on behalf of Sharkey, was
not selected as referee, and why Long
Green Lawrence's man was accepted above
all the rest on Long Green's recommenda
tion.
The taking of the depositions will be re
sumed to-morrow morniug at 10 o'clock ia
Judge Sanderson's court, and those depo
sitions wili be confined to such witnesses
as may be non-residen-ts and who may in
tend to leave the City. If General Barnes
files his answer to-morrow in the suit
brought by Fitzsimmons to recover tbe
purse the trial will be proceeded with at
once before the court and without a jury,
the case Deinp one in equity and to be de
cided by the Judge.
Judge Sanderson made a remars on the
last day's BeÂ«sion to tbe effect that it was
doubtful whether the case would be tried
at all, and it is believed that he meant to
imply that the matter was outside the
jurisdiction of the court for the reason
that prize-tighting is an offense under the
provisions of the Penal Code prohibiting
"any prize fight or contention without the
use of deadly weapons." But ihis part of
the code has been interpreted by some
lawyers to mean a fight to a finish, and
they argue that the Supervisors had a
right to pass an ordinance allowing them
to issue permits lor "boxing contests" for
a limited number of rounds, tne intention
of the State law being to put a stop to
brutalizing and degrading exhibitions of
two men bruised and bleeding and stag-
Eering with exhaustion for fifty or sixty
rounds in tbe ring.
Colonel Kowal^ky said yesterday that
in order to determine that fact it would
be necessary for the court to hear evidence
anyhow.
Manager Julian and Bob Fitzsimmons
were in good spirits yesterday. They are
confident that they can show up all the
ramifications of tbe conspiracy. Julian
is asking every one he meets why did not
Lynch and Sharkey accept Hiram Cook
when they found that he was a square
man, and why did they select Long Green
Lawrence's bosom companion, a man
known to be a gun fighter and believed to be
able to take care of himself in case of a
row over an unpopular or rank decision,
as Earp's decision was? But no to the
present time he has not received a satis
factory answer.
The manner in which General Barnes
has conducted the case thus far is univer
sally commended. He has not attempted
to take advantage of technicalities, and
seems to be actuated by a desire ;o get at
all the facts in the interest of honest
sport.. If ne continues in this course the
matter can be decided before the end of
this week and the blame can be placed
where it belongs.
In future no glove contest can take
place in this City before a fake club and a
bad man for a referee. The honest sport
ing element will give no countenance to
such affairs, while legitimate clubs before
which such contests take place will insist
that the referee shall be a man of good re
pute and acceptable to them.
Long Green and his man have dealt a
blow to honest sport in San Francisco
from which it will be difficult to recover.
The evldeuce to be presented lo the
court to-morrow will tnrow light upon the
reason why Sharney was kept an hour in
the dressing-room in the Pavilion after
the fight and why Lynch refused to admit
any doctors or reporters to examine the
pugiiist. It is natural to suppose that if
Sharkey had received a foul blow both he
and Lynch would have been only too
willing to have let the whole world ex
amine the injured fighter in order that
there might not be the slightest doubt or
suspicion in the matter.
Explanation will be offered on behalf of
Fitzsimmons as to the motives which
prompted Lynch to order Trainers Smith
and Allen out of Sharkey's room when
Dr. Lee was about to attend the pugilist
and also as to the reason why Sharkey
yelled with rain a few moments later.
It will be shown also on the tesjimonv

THREATS BY LONG GREEN.
Manager Aschner Refused to Make
a Retraction of the Truth.
Another incident has been unearthed
whjch exposes the disreputable character
of the Examiner and the bulldozing,
threatening tactics resorted to by its man
aging editor, "Long Green" Lawrence,
when Borne truths, outside of prize-fights
and referees, comes to the surface which
reveals its dishonorable methods.
It is baseball this timeâ the late tourna
ment in which the Pacific Coast champion
ship was won by the Los Angeles Tults-
Lyons, despite all Long Green and the
Examiner could do to prevent.
December 8 The Call published a dis
patch from Los Angeles telling of the
very unfair treatment the Tufts-Lyons
had received from the Examiner, which
showed prejudice in favor of the Alameda
> lens or Nevada Stars winning the pen
nant. It related how the team and all its
friends south of Tehachapi returned home
deeply indignant at the Examiner, and
uttering imprecations upon it. The Ex
aminer arbitrarily ruled out the crack
piicher of the Tufts-Lyons, after the team
had complied with all the rules stipulated
by tbe filth-loving journal, and when the
team's friends called at the editorial de
partment and remonstrated they were
answered next day with additional in
sults.
At a banquet given in honor of the win
ning team at a Los Angeles restaurant
these facts were stated, and the Examiner
was duly "roasted" for its unfair and
partial course.
Morris R. Aschner, connected with the
Los Angeles Herald, is now manager oi
the Tufts-Lyons. He arrived in this City
last Wednesday, and that night happened
to meet Long Green Lawrence about 8/
o'clock on Market street in front of the 1
Paiace Hotel.
Long Green asked Manager Morris R.
Aschner if he had seen the article in The
Call.
Manaeer Aschner replied that he had.
The bulldozing and threatening meth
ods used by the suggester of referees for
crooked prize-fights to secure a repudia
tion of the article and a statement to the
contrary are best told by Mr. Aschner.
He said yesterday:
"I met Mr. Lawrence in front of a store
on Market street, in the Palace Hotel
block, about 8 o'clock (I can tell you the
exact time, it was 8:20) night before last.
He wanted me to make or write a retrac
tion of the treatment the team had re
ceived from the Examiner and send it to
him for publication. I declined to do it.
I was not manager of the team at that
time, but the members of the team
nearly every one of themâ and I can give
the namesâ told me how Harvey haa been
ruled out of the game and of other nnfair
treatment from the Examiner. I believe
them; I may say I know It is so.
"Mr. Lawrence sai*\" Mr. Aschner con
tinued, "that if I did not do that he would
drop the team altogether, intimating that
we would get the worst of it. 1 told him
to drop us if he wanted to. We are not
under the patronage of the Examiner any
more, or Tufts-Lyons, for that matter. I
construed what he said to me as a threat.
1 offered to bet Mr. Lawrence $100 that
Harvey, the pitcher â he was about tbe
only pitcher we had â was under 18 years
of age at the time he was ruled out. Mr.
Lawrence did not bet. In fact he said: 'I
know it. We had made up our minds to
rule him out, and he had to go.' Now,
what do you think of that?"
GANS AND ROCHETTE.
With Ward and Anthony They Will
Entertain Admirers of Boxing
Next Monday Evening.
The New Occidental Club has prepared
a series of boxing contests to take place at
Woodward's Pavilion next Monday even
ing, that wiil attract considerable atten
tion in lecal sportdom.
There are two star eventsâ the first be
tween Jimmy Anthony, the champion
bantam-weight of Australia, and Jack
Ward, of high repute in Eastern boxing
circles, and the second between Joe Gans
and Charley Rochette. Gans was brought
to this city to be matched with Dal Haw
kins, but owing to illness of the latter the
club found it necessary to substitute Ro
chette.
Both Gans and Wed are in training at
Alameda and reported to be in first-class
condition. Rochette is in superb trim
and his backers are confident that he will
win. Little Jimmy Anthony is being
brought into excellent fettle by old Barney
Farley, "the professor."
The two star events will both be of ten
rounds' duration. There will be a "cur
tain-raiser" in a six- round bout between
one of "Professor" Farley's pets and in
all probability Jim Brown. TicKets are
now on sale at Mitchell's and Harry Cor
bett's, the prices being |1, $2 and $2 50, ac
cording to location of seats.
"Young Mitchell" emphasizes the fact
that these contests will be fair deals and
that their being Earped is out of the ques
tion.
LOOKED CROOKED.
A Los Angeles Expert's Opinion of
the Fiuht.
LOS ANGEI.ES, Cal., Dec. 12.â Dr. J.
D. Kennedy, ex-president of tbe athletic
club of this city, and a gentleman of the
highest standing in this community, was
asKed this afternoon what he thought of
Sharkey's claim of a foul in his late fight
with Fitzsimmons, Dr. Kennedy's reply
was:
"What do I think of the Fitzslmmons-
Sharlcey controversy? Well, I gave my
opinion a wees before the contest, and
that was that the issue depended greatly
on the selection of a competent referee
and 1 have had no reason to change my
mind.
"To me it looks crooked, and I think
any fair-minded man who knows any
thing about boxing will agree with me
that Fitzsimmons had the contest we.l in
hand, and was an unquestionable winner
when the cry of 'loui' arose; and that
Fitzsimmons, with the natural advantage
of height and reach, his past ring record,
his superiority as a boxer, and the fact
that be had his man going, would delib
erately loul him as claimed is simply an
absurdity, and evidence is being produced
that proves that I am right.
"I think one or two men clubs nave had
their funeral, and that in the future these
contests will be controlled by responsible
organizations incorporated tinder State
laws. You must consider tne public, as
they support and encourage these exhibi
tions, and the public is tired of supporting
these contests that savor of a job."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1896.
THE POOR MAY EAT
ON CHRISTMAS
Salvation Army Leaders
Are Preparing a Great
Dinner.
More People Will Be Fed Here
Than at Any Previous
Holiday.
An Encouraging Report of the Social
Work of the Army for the
Past Year.
The Safvation Army of this City will
give a great Christmas dinner for tne
benefit of the poor and needy.
The place where the good things will be
provided for those who have not often had
the opportunity to eat a good dinner dur
ing 1896 has not yet been selected, but
the leaders of the army will choose the
location in a few days. It wiil be central
and commodious.
"We are meeting with good encourage
ment everywhere," said the captain yi
charge' yesterday, "and people of means
are beginning to see that oar work does a
great deal of good, that our charity
reaches the really needy. For this reason
we are trusted and our work encouraged.
We still need aid, however, and any who
desire to contribute may send us money,
addressing it to our headquarters, 1139
Market street."
In the past the Salvation Army have
probably done mure for the poor here than
any other society, and they are ambitious
to make their dinner this year the biggest
success they have ever had. All the lieu
tenants and their assistants are busy,
working throughout the City, asking here
and there for the mites that people can
afford.
Thousands of letters have been sent
to the army's friends and to the public at
large. The letter is a typical one, and
shows not only what the army intends to
do Christmas, but what it has been doing
for the year:
San Francisco, Cal., Dec. 10, 1896.
Dear Friendâ We beg to submit herewith a
summary ol the work accomplished by the so
cial branch of the Salvation Army for "the year
ending November 30, 1896.
We also wish to outline to you our plans for
the cominsr year.
Firstâ We have just started a co-operative
farm for the benetit of men discharged from
prison and for young men who have been so
unfortunate as to fall into the hanas of the
police, where they can be sent in lieu of beine
sent to jail.
At the farm they work to support themselves
and make the place selt-supportinÃ, as the
army's idea is that every man should support
himself.
Second âWe are endeavoring to found a
hospital where the self-respecting poor can
have tirst-class medical treatmentand nursing
at such rates as the working people can afford.
By this means we know that many will be pre
vented from becoming chronic invalids or
paupers.
Thirdâ We are arranging to give our annual
Christmas dinner to poor men, women and
children, so that Christmas may become a day
of gladness to hundreds who would otherwise
be left desolate ; we therefore earnestly solicit
your help in the carrying out of these plans.
Inclosed please find a card on which you can
siate to what object you want your contribu
tion applied.
When collectors call please ask for their
authority and take a receipt for your gift
Praying that God will biess you and yours
according to the riches of his grace, believe
me to remain yours to help the hopeless,
J. Keppel, Brigadier,
Joe R. McFee, Social Secretary.
In addition to this letter thousands of
Christmas cards like the following have
Deen sent to the philanthropically in
clined:

Brigadier-General J. J. Keppel has just
issued the following address apropos of
the dinner now under preparation:
Christmas has been a day of rejoicing ever
since that all-important event when the
angels sang, "Fear not; for, behold, I bring
you good tidings of great icy, which shall be
to all people. For unto you is born this day,
In the city of David, a savior, which is Christ,
the Lord."
Ever since that time, in all Christian conn
tries, men have laid aside more or less ranks
and creeds on a common platform. And those
who have been fortunate enough to secure a
goo i portion, of the good things of this world
have met their less fortunate brethren and en
deavored to make them forge.t for that day at
least their misfortunes.
This has been done in various countries ac
cording to their customs and accompanying
circumstances, but has always taken on more
or less the character of administering to the
material comforts of those participating.
To the children of the rich, through St.
Nicholas, Christmas means a day which would
bring to them the riches and good things they
had long anticipated. On the other hand, to
the children of the poor St. Nicholas is known
by name only, except as some warm-hearted
friend occasionally sends in tne thing they
most need. Often it takes but little to make
Christmas a red-letter day in the life of one of
these unfortunates. I remember the case of a
lady, who had spent her former Christmas
days mid all the sumptuousness of the ducal
paiace. The next was spent on a barren rock,
with no worldly comforts, and with no shelter
to protect her from the furies of the storm.
Yet through a single act Â«f kindness it was
made the happiest of her life.
It was brought about by the presentation of
a single albatross egg, the only remaining one
of a store laid by to be used as a delicacy in
the event oi sickness*.
In the history of the Salvation Army many
such incidents have taken place where some
very insignificant thins has brought great joy
into the life of some needy one. This has
been especially the case in San Francisco
where the army has won the name of almoners
for the rich. When this distinction was first
conferred upoii them in San Francisco the
public would not believe their declaration
that a thousand poor men would be in need of
a Christmas dinner. Yet when dinner was
served twelve hundred sat down to it, and to
their utter amazemunt ttiree sons of million
aires were pointed out to them, and many
others who had been crauled in the lap ol
luxury, gome of the.-^e men who ate this din
ner declared it wus the first warm meal they
had eaten for months.
The next Christmas 2200 men were enter
tained, and a permanent food and shelter
depot opened where men could get a good
meal or bed for 5 cents.
The following Christmas was a monster
demonstration, 3300 men, women and chil
dren being provided for, and 2600 children
found themselves reveling In all the wealth of
toys, candies and other good things; and for
four months afterward a Christmas tree was
provided that furnished the poor and needy
with clothes, food and fueL
Each succeeding Christmas has found the
Salvation Army feeding thousands of men,
women and children, and adding some perma
nent feature for the welfare of the poor of this
City, so that now the Salvation Army has a
men's shelter, a women's shelter, a children's
home and a farm or home for ex-convicts.
It is very probable ihat the dinner this
year will" excel any ever given and that
more people will be fed by the Army on
that day tnan ever before in this City*
TERRILL'S CONTEST.
He Ssya He Defeated Sidney Hall for
State Senator.
John G. Terrill has filed a contest to the
election of Sidney Hall to the office of
State Senator for the Twenty-third Sena
torial District.
The allegations of the complaint are to
the effect that there were many irregulari
ties in the receiving and canvassing of
votes throughout the district, it is set
forth that the election officers and
clerks were guilty of misconduct in mark
ing ballots, so that secrecy was destroyed,
in counting Terrill's votes for Hall, in
becoming intoxicated to such an extent
that they were unable to properly perform
their duties, and in doing many other
things of like character.
According to the figures submitted by
Mr. Terrill he ought to be elected by 1000
plurality. Testimony in the case will be
heard by Justices of the Peace Barry and
Cook.
Another contest to Mr. Hall's right to
the seat for tbe Twenty-third Senatorial
District is already pending, the plaintiff
in that case being M. J. Welch, in which
the same Justices will take testimony' for
the information of the State Senate, where
the matter must be atlar-st decided.
A MOVABLE BEDROOM.
William Gould Ask t Damages for a Fall
From a Merced Kiver Bridge.
The first suit against the San Francisco
and San Joaquin Railroad. Company for
personal injuries has been filed in this
City. William Gould asks for $20,000
damages, and for cause of action alleges
that on the 14th of last May he went into
a sleeping-car or caboose supplied by the
company for the use of employes near tne
Merced River and that after he had re
tired the caboose was run out on a bridge
over the river without his knowledge;
that during the night he started from the
oar to get a pail of water and not knowing
of the change of the caboose stepped from
the caboose to the ground Â£clow, a dis
tance of forty feet. He fears that the acci
dent has incapacitated him for work and
he demands $20,000 as compensation.

LOCKJAW CAUSED
FISHER'S DEATH
A Plumber Scratched While
Working in China
town.
The Disease Gained Such a Hold
That All Remedies Were
Useless.
Dr. Brune Used tbe Antitoxic Treat*
ment Without Avail â He Died
in Great Agony,
Bernhard F. Fisher, a plumber, who
lived at 1163 Mission street, died yesterday
morning of lockjaw contracted in a most
remarkable manner.
He was employed to do some plumbing
work in Chinatown early last week, and
while connecting some t>ipe that had
previously been used, scratched his right
hand slightly.
Such occurrences were nothing new to
him, and he paid little attention to the
wound. The next day the scratch was
slightly inflamed, but he kept at work and
felt no particularly bad results until last
Wednesday, when his neck began to stiffen
and his jaws to swell, ana he was com
pelled to remain at nome.
Dr. A. E. Brune of 1104 Market street,
was called on Friday to see him, and at
once pronounced it a case of tetanus,
whicn is the scientific name for lockjaw.
Everything posible was done for the
unfortunate man, but the bacilli of the
terrible disease had worked thoroughly
into ids system and he died yesterday in
terrible agony.
Dr. Brune said last evening that it was
one of the most remarkable cases that had
ever come under his observation.
"Tetanus from any cause is an uncom
mon disease," he continued, "but this is
even more extraordinary.
"As a usual thing, tetanns, which is al
most invariably fatal, is contracted from
a wound in the foot. The germs of the
disease are iound, in a large majority of
instances, in the ground, and usually get
into the system by the patient stepping
on a rusty nail that has been lying long in
contact with the earth. It is prevalent in
the East Indies, where many children
who are allowed to play about when very
young contract it.
"In Fisher's case, however, it came
from an insignificant wound in the hand
and had obtained such a hold on him that
there was no remedy that would check it.
His jaws were set when I first saw him.
1 applied the anti-toxic treatment for tet
anus as soon as I saw from the swellings
of his jaws that it was a true case of lock
jaw, but there was no apparent relief and
he died.
"This is the first case that has come
under my notice of a man dying from
tetanus caused by so slight a wound."
WIRT SEEKS A MANDATE.
To Compel the Governor to Same Two,
'Police Com vii 88 i oners.
N. S. Wirt, an attorney, seeks to reopen
the question concerning the power of the
Governor to remove the Board of Police
Commissioners from office. This question
was supposed to hare been settled by the
Supreme Court in the contest between
Menzies and Gunst, but Mr. Wirt has peti
tioned the Supreme Court for a writ of
mandate, directed against Governor Budd,
to bring about the removal of Police Com
missioners Alvord and To bin, and the ap
pointment by the Governor of two others
to fill the vacancies thus to be occasioned.
Tn his petition Mr. W irt alleges that
William Alvord and Robert J. Tobin were
appointed as Police Commissioners April
9, 1878, by the Judges of the Fourth,
Twelfth and Fifteenth Judicial districts;
that they failed to take oath or qualify
after their appointments within the time
required by law, and did not, in fact,
qualify until May 5, 1885; that they held
office without title and were, usurpers;
that they were appointed Police Commis
sioners by Governor Waterman July 11,
1890, for the term of four years, and that
they qualified July 17, 1890; but after their
terms had expired they were not appointed
and the offices have been vacant since July
11, 1894. For these reasons a writ of man
date is asked for commanding Governor
Budd "to appoint two reputable citizens
to fill the vacancy in the office now occu
nied and unlawfully held by said Alvord
and Tobin."
Dr. C. W. Hibbard Injured.
Dr. C. W. Hibbard met with an unfortunate
accident Friday night. He had been attend
ing the horse show, and going home boarded
a Sutter-street car. At the intersection of
Polk and Sutler streets the car struck the
"bumper," and Dr. Hiboard, who was sitting
on the rear seat of the dummy, was thrown
backward with sufficient force to break his
collarbone. He was assisted home by the
company's physician, and the bone set with
the assistance of Drs. Satter and Taylor. None
otthe other passengers were injured.

W I licious enthusiasm down in the Latin
' quarter. It is said that the Sunday
no ils are so crowded that one has to go
cany to get standing room, and some of
the teachers are thinking of resigning on
account of the number in their cla><es.
The children are singing sonss and learn
ing to recite, and are taking part, heart
and soul, and getting ready for the Christ
mas entertainment.
This is a strange thing, and I looked up

Excursion irv tke Latirv Quarter
at the young lady who was busily hanging
decorations for the coining festivities. "Is
it on account of t lie efforts of the Salva
tion Army orâ" â¢
"Oh, no! it's on account of the Christ
mas tree," she said. She laid down her
hammer and sat on a rung of the ladder.
"La:-.t year when they came I was so en
thusiastic I nearly made myself sick work
ing with them. And they aid well on the
night of the entertainment, and they had
a good time with nuts and candies and
presents. The next Sunday after Christ
mas I came back ready to work again, and
found â A Jarger number? No, indeed,
one little girl, and she was there because
she dad been sick the night of tne enter
tainment and she thought we might have
saved her candy and presents for her."
She ciimbed up and went to work again.
"Oh, no; we don't get discouraged.
They crowd in again in the springtime,
you know."
"In the springtime?"
"Yes." She looked down over her
shoulder. "T.iat's the time for tbe Sun
day-school picnics. Come and visit us,"
she called as I went out of the door.
And here I am on Broadway, with its
rows of saioons and odd-looking shops,
its dark alleys leading to nowhere or to
darker ones, where no atray sunbeams
ever shine. Children ! They seemed to
spring out of the earth. They darted in
and out of alleys and almost under one's
fee t. They crowded the steps of the sa
loons and doorways of tne houses, tor
mented passers-h}', hung on to passing
wagons and my heart btood still lest they
should be trampled by the horses or
crushed under the wheels. But before
one has gone a block he will learn that
to the child of the Latin quarter "fear" is
an unknown word.
A woman stood in the doorway of a
house. The sun was warm, but she had a
shawl wrapped about her and in her eyes
there was a look of misery as of some wild
animal driven to bay. She was watching
two little dark-eyed babes intent on their
play.
"Yours?" I asked.
The dark face grew hard and she drew
the shawl closer and shivered.
She sbook her head. "Fourâ all gone!"
said she, and pointed to the ground be
neath our feet. Four, and all gone, and
the mother-love eating her life away. 1
looked back. There were other women in
tent on work or gossiping idly or shrilly
scolding the little ones. Bui that first
figure stood where I had left her watching
and Jon gin?.
Further on a little one with brown eyes
and golden curls sat in the sunshine on
the low steps of a grogshop. A woman
came out when 1 began to speak. She had
been drinking and she caught the child in
her arms ?.nd looked at me.
"How pretty she is !" 1 remarked.

The woman, still young, still with the
marks of some beamy about her, smiled.
"Does sne look most like you or her
father?"
Khe laughed heartil >â¢ nr. that.
"It's nobody's child," she said, "so I'm
both father and mother." And she went
in again and closed the door.
Pacific street seemed dingier and darker,
and the alleys more gloomy. A few men
skulked in and out of the latter, and a iew
women peered forth curious'y. But the
children were still numerous, basking out
in the sun like so many little alligators.
A crowd of girl 3 were quarreling on the
curbing. "Her stole one of my Sunday
school cards," cried one, with hair that
puts the sun to shame, turning ncr blue
eyes to my face. The other looked up, her
black eyes flashing.
"I don't steal," she snapped.
"I've been to all the m ssious and you
haven't, and you did steal it."
The daughter of Italy jumped to her
little feet, and, grasping the other's hair
in her little brown hands, she gave two
vicious pulls and then fled down the alley.
The other child never moved a muscle,

but sat staring at the place where her en
emy had disappeared.
"Didn't she hurt you?"
Gravely she shook her head. "Her's
too mean to hurt," she said.
A little girl, whose frail form bent be
neath a heavy load of wood, came toiling
up the hill. Half way up she paused and
cau slit her breath.
"Isn't that too heavy?"
She raised her big eyes to mine, and
then drew back and dropped her head,
and her sweet face flushed with bashful
ness. Just then three boys came down
the hill. Between them they had a dog,
and the dispute over his possession waxed
loud and furious.
"He's mine!" shouted one, "and I'll
have him, too!"
The little girl had started on again.
Suddenly the boys noticed her.
"Say, fellers, there's Em and the wood."
And, then, suddenly freed, the dog went
bounding down the hill forgotten, and
the boys had snatched the load of wood
and started up the hill on a run. The
little girl followed as fast as possible.
Half way up the next hill they hurried,

and then they threw the wood up the
steep steps of a tenement house and went
their way. And I saw the girl go up the
steps and carry the wood into the house.
Primitive gallantry ? Yes; but real.
In the shadow of Telegraph Hill sat a
busy crowd of lads. As I walked toward
them one shouted, "Say! Any streets
named # after you?'' Then he laughed. He
had ou an old blue cap, and it was set way
back upon a head of golden curls that
looked like a rebellious halo. His features
were good and his face had once been
clean. I should like to have seen him tbat
once.
"We're coing to have a feed."
"You are?"
"You bet! A chicken feast right here in
these wood?."
The rumble of the rock wagons, the
steam whistles, the noise of the City and
the sounds of adjacent machinery, as well
as the absence of all trees, made me smile.
The woods were God's flist temples!
I wondered what Mr. Bryant would
have thought had he stood there. Still
the boys looked so serious that I deter
mined to imagine myseif â
In the darkling woods
Amid tbe cool and silence.
"How do you have your feast?"
"Well, we build a bonfire and each fellow
has his chicken and some bread and salt.
Then we pull the featners off the chicken
and roast 'em."
"Don't you c can them ?"
A look of surprise went round. "Course
not â that's too much work for nothing."
"We have clambakes, too!" spoke up
another boy. "They're great. You ought
to come some time."
"Here comes Bob," somebody shouted.
"Do you know Sodawater Bob?" nsked
the first speaker. "No? Well, he's all
right ! He's got a job and earns lots of
stuff. Then he treats, and we fellows all
treat square."
"Sodawater Bob," a small boy with a
pleasant face and big cuffs seemed to be a
great favorite. He wouldn't sit down.
"Got to hurry back, fellows," he said,
"earning money for Christmas."
"What are you going to do with it?"
asked I. "Buy presents for my grand
mother and my little brother," he an
swered. "Then I'm going to treat the fel
lows a little, too." He turned to go and I
walked alone with him.
"They're good fellows," he said, "only
tliey haven't got jpbs."
"Do they want to work?"
"Most of them do. All the others look
up to you when you're earning money."
Then Bob walked off up the street.
The sun was setting. The few fleecy
clouds that hovered above Telegraph Hill
were taking on a hint of tbe dying day.
An old man stood in a doorway:
"Been walking far?" he asked. "Talk
ing to the children? Well there are plenty
of them, and they're not bad if they're
kept out of mischief." I looked up at the
tall hill, in the shadow of which is all tliis
wretchedness and misery. At the top,
standing clear against the sunset sky, now
kindled with beauty, towered the large
castle which crowns the hill. Below were
strewn the hovels of the poor. But I saw
that in tho side nf the hill stops were cut,
hewn out of the hard stone â steps that
led almost to the summit. A woman was
passing. In her hand she carried a
pitcher.
"Will you tell me who made those
steps?" I asked. She looked at them.
"The good-for-nothing boys," she said,
and went her way.
On Pacific street and Broadway the
lignts were beginning to gleam. Men
and women were passing on the streets
and the children were hurrying to their
homes. But did not they carry a little of
the sunlight in which they had been play
ing into the dark alleys and tbe miserable
homes?
Then I thought of the steps that led up
to the pure air, and even up to where the
beauty of the suruet still lingered. And i
prayed that the children who hewed those
steps up the rocky height would hew
their way likewise in time, and in spite of
these early environments, up the hard
heights of life, even to the summit.

STARTLING REVELATIONS IN A STRANGE NEW LONDON CLUB
LONDON. Eng., Dec. I.â Far be it from
me to condone Mrs. Whitehat's attitude
in regard to one of the momentous ques
tions of the day; far be it from me to en
courace her indifference, her flippancy
and disrespect toward one of the most use
ful and one of the most serious clubs for
women in London. Mrs. Whitehat's char
acter shows an appalling lack of those
severe virtues that make the worthy
women of tbe New Age Club so justly, so
universally revered.
It is the i rerogative of schoolgirls and
Americans to laugh at everything, even
the grave and intellectual subjects so
learnedly treated by various members.
Such levity cannot be too sternly con
demned; a sense of humor should be dis
carded in the entry with overshoes and
umbrellas.
In the first place the inappropriatsness
of her costume was shocking. Instead of
a simple masculine garb and a knock
about hat, worn with the careless, uncon
scious grace with which an animal wears
his fur, Mrs. Whitehat had attired herself
with her usual delighted attention to de
tail and that s< nse of enjoyment and suc
cess which might well be the result of
nobler employments.
"I would not," she remarked, fastening
her opera cape, "look like a 'frump' to
oblige the Queen herself!" Her gown wasâ
I hate to confess itâ made in the very
latest fashion and had a most audible rus
tle and quite a flutter of silk and lace and
ribbons about it.
One of the regulations of the club and a
most admirable regulation is thai bonnets
must be removed during dinner. Mrs.
Whitehat expressed a most unnatural re
luctance to remove the wreath of roses,
which she dignified by the name of a bon
net, and said, with indignant scorn: "How
stupid I It's so much more becoming on
my head than off!" Becoming! Such a
word in this high piace, where vanity is
not!
Fortunately she was not overheard save
by a most minute and dejee'ed male door
keeper, aged 8, who regarded her with a
kind of melancholy approval.
"I smell a faint, far smell," she added,
"as of the festive cauliflower!"
With agony in my heart we swept into
the dining-room â that is, Mrs. Whitehat
did all the sweeping. I tried to slide in
unobtrusively, feeling that her presence
was a hideous mistake. It was an impres
sive scene. A number of tne club mem
bers were seated at a long table; they
each of them had a book or a magazine
propped up before <hem and they read
with an expression of deep absorption.
FAMOUS NATURAL BRIDGE AS IT IS
"That is where they let down ihe rope
to the boy. He jumped from that little
ledge you see way up there â that bird just
flew past it â and caught the rope as it
swung toward him."
We looked up, stretching our heads back
until our necks ached.
'Is that story really true?"
'The old settlers around here say so.
The boy was a student from Washington-
End-Lee, which is not very far from here.
Of course, the account oi the feat, usiially
found in fifth readers, is a good deal ex
aggerated. There was no crowd watching
while he climbed, as the story says; only
a few of his friends were with Lim; but it
is true that a boy really did climb nearly
to the top of the bridge. You see that
ledge up there almost under the arch?
When he reached that place he could
climb no furiher on account of the arch
ing over the 'brid.e. Then they say he
looked back to Fee how to climb down
again. You know it's a fact that you can
climb no much easier than down." There
may be a deeper significance to those
word?, 1 thoucht.
"When you look downward everything
appears to be smoother. So there the boy
hung, nearly 200 feet from the ground,
unable to move one Â«vay or the other."
We looked again up to that tiny projec
tion ; not much bigger than the bowl of a
spoon, it wemed from thttt great distance.
It was awlnl. Later, when we went to the
top of the bridge, we looked down; it was
frightful.
We were standing under the shadow of
that fearful monument of the Builder who
knows no limits, the bridge whose walls
are mountains, and whose buttresses are
peaks, says a writer in the Atlanta Jour
nal. The ravine is so deep the sun shines
in only about noon. And all this mag
nificence cf architecture royally thrown
away on a mere wading stream ! Its fish
no bigger than minnows. But the Build
er's quarry, likewise, knows no limits.
The approach to the bridge is by a nar
row, tortuous, rapidly descending path.
A small stream tumbles down the moun
tain beside us all the way. The deep foli
age of the trees keeps U3 hidden from a
view of the bridge, until a sharp turn to
the right suddenly brings us up almost
under it.
But the fim sight, perhaps, is a little
disappointing. The mind has to take
time to adjust itself to these enormous
dimension?. As we approach it, at length
stand just under the bridge itself, and look
upward, perhaps even then we are still a
little disappointed, until suddenly we are
startled by a faint-crying flock of swallows
flying under the bridge; then we begin to
comprehend its dizzy altitude.
Tlie approach is not so impressive as the
opposite view on account of the dipping
of the arch on that side. To walk 100 feet
further on, passing under the bridge, and
then look back at it, one catches tbe curves
of its enormous convexity and the lift of
Its span. On this side also the two moun
tains that buttress the bridge rapidly rise
for some distance further on; conse
quently the ravine wails are much higher.
All these things combine to make the lat
ter view of the bridge very impressive.
Cathedral wall, nearly 300 feet high,
straight as the aide of a house, buttressed
and turreted, towers up on one side.
Across the ravine from it, overhanging
the abyss below, is a Jittie ledge of rock
not ten feet square, Pulpit Rock. Here
one may stand and look belowâ if he can
and try to realize the honor of that boy
when ne : 'caucht the faint echoes of the
people beneath him shoutiug to hikn to
jump for the rope." In an old Virginia
history there is a statement that when the
boy was drawn up his hair bad turned
white.
Nothing grovg ("own the sides of this
ravine. It is all rock, solid and ghostly.
If one were to slip he would strike against
nothing on his way until he struct the
ground. There is scarcely place lor a bird
to alight How did the boy climb It?
The story goes that he had a knife and
cut footholes between the rock rims.
And ii is narrow, that little silver run
ning ravine, just room enough for its
broofc and a footpath besile it. It is nar
row and cold under the shadow of these
sternal ramparts. When birds fly down
into it they merely drop; there is not
room to use their wings. They spread
them out to break the fall and drop down
They seemed to regard dining as a sort of
mechanical assistance to literature, ami
exhibited that superiorify to the material
satisfaction of the baser appetites it has
always been my fervently economic hope
to acquire.
Mrs. Whitehat greeted our hostess with
almost florid effusion and flashed her
smiles upon every one with quite bewilder
ing impartiality. Her eyes immediately
attached themselves to a portrait in an
oval frame above the fireplace.
"What a handsome face!" she said in
lively tones. "Who is it?'
"The president of our club," said our
hostess, with a kind of mental bow.
"Indeed!" said Mrs. Whitebat, with
great interest. "What a curious idea to
have a man as president of a woman's
club!" There was a moment of terrible
silence.
"A man!" echoed our hostess in icy
tones, "J cannot conceive what you mean,
unless in your idaa character and face
and strength of expression should be
limitett to men."
"Iâ l was deceived," said Mrs.Whitehat
humbly, "by the coat and necktie and
the short hair."
"That face is womanly in the highest
sense," said our hostess; "it is a repre
sentative face, having all the delicacy of
woman and all the power that is supposed
to be peculiar to man."
Mrs. Whitehat asserted that she pro
nounced the obnoxious word with a kind
like leaves. If a Niagara were spilling
over one of its sides its leap would strike
against the opposite wail.
Above nature has so coyly softened the
edge of the hideous precipice, so hidden it
with blossoming trees and mossy turf that
a dreamer walking there would unexpect
edly feel a sharp slip of bis feet, would
catch out at a tree, a bit of grass â the sud
den flashlight of a yawning abyss â death!
One comes shouting and laughing down
the 6teps toward Pulpit Reckâ suddenly
stops himself aghast, quivering on the
very edge of the frightful drop.
In 1779 a great mass of rock was split off
from the arch by the freezing of the water
in its crevices and was hurled below,
crashing into a million fragments. The
ground is littered over with bits of rock,
with here and there a boulder half embed
ded in the soil. There hangs on the left of
the arch as one approaches another mass
just ready to fall; a wide crack extends
from the top of the hiil almost down to
the ground. Half a hill yawns! A col
umn of earth and frightful rocks half as
big as freightcars stand up there in the
air, held back by a few clods, a slender
stone, a root or two. When it falls one
power exists that may clear it away â the
river.
"<5. W." There it is: His own auto
graph â Washington's. It is one of the
great "prize-boxes" of the bridge. It is
cut deep into the rock about thirty feet
above the ground. Several other names
Bre cut above this, but they were not put
there by climbers: some engineers placed
ladders against the rock and thus reached
the point. The "G. W." is said to be
really genuine. The old settler voucnes
for this fact also. The "W." is quite
plain, but the "G." is somewhat uncer
tain.
Other points of interest are Lost River,
an underground river whose running can
be heard by stooping down close to a hole
in the side of the mountain. Saltpeter
Cave, a new crevice unuer a large ledge of
rock, which furnished niter to the sol
diers of 1812; the "Keeper of the Bridge,"
a perfect profile of a very old man near
the arch of the bridge. A glimpse of the
rushing waters of Lost River can be seen
through the hole in the hill. It is per
fectly clear and cold, and as pure as if it
had been filtered. Over the hole, cut into
the stone, by whom no one knows, is tbe
legend: "He who drinks here shall re
turn." Our party felt doubly sure of re
turning, for we drank of the water unwit
tingly, and saw the words only after
ward.
What caused the bridge? We cannot
fail to ask it as we gaze up at the tremen
dous mass. It is unreasonable to suppose
that it ie to-day in the same form that It
had "in the beginning." Was tbe entire
ravine once a long and tortuous cave?
Did the little creek rippling along beside
us throughout the ages, stretching so far
back that we cannot even comprehend the
number, thread that enormous needle and
work on down and down, painfully drill
ing the eye, until it is the frightful thing
we see it now? Was it once a mountain
lake, checked by a great stone-capped dam
that one day, while mastodon and levia
than disported themselves in its waters,
long before the aneels ever dreamed of
man. one awful day, suddenly burst
through these bounds on its maddeneu
way, that, roaring and hissing, grinding
and shrieking, plowed its horrible furrow
between two affrighted, gaping moun
tains?
Some Queer Industries.
Occupations open to tbe thrifty indivi
duals of both sexes have greatly increased
during the last two decades, or even since
the taking of the last decennial census in
1890.
The extraordinary progress of science
during the time specified and tbe applica
tion of its principles to the practical prob
lems of human life have not only had the
effect of greatly increasing the capacity
for production in the trades already estab
lished, but have opened hundreds of
queer side alleys which lead direct to the
avenues of trade.
There are, of conrse, dozens of these
new and remarkable occupations with
which science does not deal, even in the
remotest sense, says the St. Louis Re
public. In this class we find the rat
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1896.
of a neigh like an ancient warhorse or a
goat.
The solitary waiter slunfc out. There is
no other word that could convey the en
tire humility of liis manner. He was
crushed by the degrading consciousness of
his sex.
After this faux pas Mrs. Whitehat was
slightly subdued. The dinner was served,
with long periods for reflection between
courses. Mrs. Whitehat attacked each
plate as it was placed before her with
great ardor, which seemed to fade away
with the first or second mouthful. I re
gret to say that her appetite \s another of
her failing?; she is always hungry and
her expression of anguish as the meal pro
ceeded was eminently unbecoming. When
the dinner concluded in a little tombstone
with red trimmings, she seemed to feel
that it would be a pity to disturb the
charming shape and let it go from her un
touched. It had a curious taste; 1 am
unable to state what it was composed of,
but if swallowed hastily, in throat masti
cation, I am sure no taste at all could be
detected.
The distinguishing characteristic of the
meniais in the establishment seems to be
their veracity. It shows a wonderful lack
of prejudice and broad-minded justice

The demand for American hardwoods
in Europe is growing, and oak leads the
foreign shipments, although tulip, poplar,
ash, gum and black walnut, whenever a
good quality can be secured, are in aome
demand. European consumers like the
quality of American oak, and, since it is
known to be plentiful here, it will prob
ably be in increasing demand. Cotton
wood has been shipped to Germany in
considerable quantities, where cheap
wood -is required for furniture and other
uses. Much of this lumber is forwarded
from New Orleans, and since a great part
of the oak, ash, popiar, cotton wood and
other timbers demanded by the foreign
market is in the Southern States, it is not
improbable that lumber for foreign mar

* little over. Mr. Robinson was intro
duced in a fitting; manner, with a quota
tion from Walt Whitman.
Mr. Robinson was an earnest man, with
a north country burr in his speech. He
was to lecture on "Humane Science."
He had a fine and characteristic head on
the top of a very narrow and emaciated
frame. His voice had a slightly monoto
nous drone, but his sentiments were,
grand. It is a curious thing that in order
to really appreciate grand sentiments it is
necessary to close or very nearly close the
eyes.
"In the pure, dry light of he intellect,"
said the lecturerâ l am afraid I did not
quite father what that pure, dry light was
to illuminate. How bitterly did I regret
my defective education when I saw the
rapt expression in the faces around me.
The woman next to me seemed almost
overcome by emotion. She was a very
large woman and swayed constantly to my
side. A look of grest peace was on her
countenance and she was drinking in the
great words of the lecturer with a little
whistling sound between her teeth. She
also evidently found that closing the
eyes made her faculues for listening more
acute. It was in the spirit of sincerest
emulation that I attempted it also â just
for a momentâ but I fear that 1 must have
slept, for 1 suddenly sat up, with a terri

WOMEN LAWYERS OF AMERICA
The woman lawyer is largely a develop
ment of the la3t twenty-five years and of
this country, says Leslie's WeeKly. There
were 208 women lawyers in the United
States in 1890. Though no census has
been taken since then it is safe to say that
the number now is at least 500. No other
country has half as many women in the
legal profession. The prejudice and op
position which so long obstructed their
progress are rapidly disappearing. Women
are now being received and recognized by
their brother mem ters of the profession,
as was very recently illustrated when a
New York Judge appointed several promi
nent New York women lawyers to re
ceivershius. This is the first time women
nave had such appointments, and the act
of the courtis regarded :is a distinct step
in their progress at the bar.
The courts for a long time discouraged
the legal aspirations of women. When
the late Myra C. Bradwell applied in 1870
for permission to practice law in Illinois
the Supreme Court of that State denied
her application, and its decision was af
firmed by the Supreme Court of tbe United
States, the only dissenting opinion being
that of Chief Justice ChÃse. Three years
afterward the Legislature of Illinois
passed a law providing that no person
should be precluded from any occupation,
except military, on account of sex. This
started the movement in favor of the
women, and now It is not believed that
any State would offer serious objections to
women practicing in its courts. Most of
the law schools accept women pupils,
although three of the most prominent â
those of Columbia, Yale aud Harvard â
still take tbe old conservative view of the
matter and admit men only. The law de
partments of ihe University of Michigan
and the New York University have grad
uated more women than any others in the
country. The first woman graduated from
a law school in this or any other country
was Mrs. Ada E. Kepley of Illinois, who
completed her law course in the North
western University, Chicago, in 1870.
The experience of Mrs. Clara Fo.tz, who
is now a practicing lawyer in this city,
one sat bolt upright and had a painful,
glassy stare. It was quite a moment be
fore the excitement subsided. It was this
incident that brought Mrs.Whitehat to
the notice of her immediate neighbors. I
discovered, to my horror, that instead or
listening with that respectful attention
which was so admirable a feature of the
audience she had her face buried in her
handkerchief and was indulging in laugh
ter, the most unseemly and uncalled for
and untimely imaginable!
The lecture was deeply impressive, I am
sure; it wasâ wellâ as I have said, thÂ»
subject was "Humane Science," a most
interesting subject, the development of
which cannot fail toelevate the listener.
A young lady behind me (Mrs. White
hat had remarked her gown, which was
nobly suggestive of an antiqueâ a very
antique) applauded continually. Her en
thusiasm found vent in this manner: Her
hands met with a concussion like a pistol
shot immediately behind my ear. It
must have been a great encouragement to
ti;e lecturer, and served as a kind of
punctuation. Behind me another en
thusiast murmured, "Hear, hear I" in a
deep, bass voice.
â¢'When we reflect on the vast changes,"
said the lecturer, "that have made the
last century [applause from the lady in
the Roman drapery] that have made the
last century so" ["Hear, hear!" came like
the muffled stroke of a drum.]
The lecturer completed his argument
and sat down, while the applause was
long and continuous. The lady who oc
cupied the chair arose and said that Mr.
Edward Robinson had kindly offered to
answer any questions that might be put
by doubting minds.
Everybody iooked at everybody else
wiih an expectant, an encouraging or a
reproachful stare. The lady in the chair
repeated her demand for questions with a
raised voice, that had a subdued threat
in it.
At last there was 3 response.
"I was afraid," said the deep, bass voice
behind me, "to occupy the attention too
long. My question is, with an apology to
Mr. Edward Robinson and my grateful
acknowledgments of his absorbing and
deeply scientific facts, whether introspec
tion, as he asserts, can have a wholly
beneficial effect upon a wholesome and
sane organization?"
Here she consulted a small table and
put it and her hands in her coat pockets.
"I have made a special study of heredity
in cats," she continued. "Some Kittens
have shown a remarkable sens 9of color;

illustrates the difficulties women have
had to contend with in the past in follow
ing legal pursuits. Left a widow with
children while yet a young woman, she
determined to practice law in California,
despite the fact that tbe State code gave
no authority to women to enter the legal
profession. That obstacle was soon re
moved, and she attempted to enter the
Hastings College in San Francisco. The
faculty refused to admit her, and she
brought a suit which was finally decided
in her favor. She was admitted to prac
tice in the District Court of California,
then in the California Supreme Court,
and finally in the Supreme Court of the
United States, achieving, after many dif
nclties, a complete triumph in herfi^ht
for legal status as a lawyer. Another
woman who was early admitted to prac
tice in the United States courts is Mrs.
Emma H. Haddock, wiio is now a mem
ber of the faculty of the lowa State Uni
versity.
Chicago is said to have more women
lawyers than any other city in the coun
try. Of these Eilen A. Martin is one of
the most prominent and has been longest
a practitioner. She made her first essay
at the law in Chicago nineteen years ago.
A remarkable woman lawyer of Chicago
is Mias Blanche Fearing, who is a poet as
well as a lawyer and has done excellent
work in both fields in spite of a great
handicap. She is totally blind. Milwau
kee has a family of women lawyers. Mrs.
Kate Pier and her three daughters have
all been admitted to the bar and are in
active practice, with a business which is
already large and is rapidly crowing.
Ther,e are manyotner prominent women
lawyers in the various cities, and their
work proves the falsity of the old belief
that women have neither the inclination
nor the ability to master the intricacies of
the law. It is true that a woman arguing
a case before a jury is a rarity, but it must
be remembered that the great bulk of
legal business is done out of court and not
in it. In a talk with the writer on women
in the law Mrs. Cornelia Hood of Brook
lyn, who is the founder of the Women's
Legal Education Society, has the follow
ing to say:
"I think the time is coming when a
knowledge of the law will be considered
an essential part of the education of both
men and women. In the last few years
the Legislatures in most of the States
have very considerably augmented
women's civil rights and are continuing
to do so. To understand and reap the
benefit of her new position in the eyes of
the law woman roust have some legal
knowledge; when she acquires the rieht
to take part in ths affairs of government
through her ballot she will be at a great
disadvantage if she does not know some
thing of legal principles. I believe that
women lawyers will be in demand in the
near future, and therefore I think that
the law is a good profession for bright
women. It is no more difficult than other
professions for women whose rea-oning
powers are rood and just as interesting
when once entered.
"The woman practitioner need not go
into the courts unless she desires to. A
ereat many lawyers have lucrative office
practices, and a clever woman may do a
great deal of business managing estates
for women and advising them in matters
of law. 1 do not believe, however, that
women need have any trepidation about
practicing in the courts. Tne few who
have attempted it have been remarkably
successful. Tr.ey have received the closest
attention from juries, and tue judges have
in most cases treated them in all respects
like their masculine fellow-lawyers. The
public is rapidly becoming accustomed to
women lawyers. It is beginning to appre
ciate the fact that they are careful, con
scientious and capable."
Irvsects With parasols.
How true it is that we most frequently
overlook most interesting things near at
hand, while searching for wonders far
away, says a writer in the New York Her
ald.
It is as true in the forest as in the city

his nearest neighbors.

How (Joes Mr. Eiward Robinson intend to
verify his assert. ons, triumphantly as he
has expressed them?"
This was a tremendous poser. Mr. Rob
inson mopped his brow, but answered
shortly and decisively in a most satisfac
tory manner.
Here a lady in tbe corner, with her hat
worn over one ear, arose and announced
that she also had a question:
"Humanity ith unity," she began, "but
if philanthropy ith made emothional. liow
would Mr. Eiward Robinthon ever ac
complith anything?"
The answer was received with deservpd
applause. Then the young rerson who
had clapped so cleverly ami continuously
rose and declaimed her question in sonor
ous tones, speaking slowly and wish deep
pathetic emphasis on every word, her
voice gradually rising till it rang through
the roomr:
"If," sho began. "I have understood Mr
Edward Robinson aright, he points to a.
path of glory on which we allâ all mem
bers of the New Age Clubâ will tread, but
he must point the path, be must show
us the way. My question to M. Ed
ward Robinson, if I have understood him.
aright, is 'Where is the goal? Where is
the goal?'"
With one upraised hand she pointed ec
statically to heaven, with the other she
transfixed the lecturer.
Mr. Edward Robinson was spellbound
with admiration, or some emotion that
held him silent, while a strange spasm
convulsed his face. To my overwhelming
sorrow and shame I regret that I did â¢ t
hear the answer to this question, for r "*-
Whitebat rose suddenly and precipitated
herself from ihe room. I hurried after her
and found her in the lower hall, seated in
the hatstand, wiping away tears â it is in
credible but true â tears of deep enjoyment
and uiterly unappreciative laughter. All
the way home in the hansom she indulged
herself in this heartless and unfeeling
manner. "This serious aud elevated
place," I remarked, sternly, "should be

frivolous! In tha pure, dry light of the

"Stop, please," groaned Mrs. Whitehat,
"that's just it â if it were only not so pure

unobservant of the things immediately
about me. It came about in this manner:
I was camping alone on the island of To
bago and had taken the trail leading from
my hut on the beach into the deep forest â
a path over which I had walked at least a
score of timea before â and I presently
reached a spot where the shade was so
dense that it made a sort of twilight.
Suddenly there appeared to my astonished
eyes something which caused me to rub
them in doubt whether I was not dream
ing, for right in front of me, crossing the
path, was a band of green, stretching
across the brown, dun-colored earth, and
as my eyes became accustomed to the dim
light, so that I could observe it morfe par
ticularly, I saw that this green ribbon was
moving regularly along, like the belt over
a factory wheel. At first it seemod Utrjtp
solid and unbroken, but soon I detec^V
many divisions in the line, and saw tha. \
was composed of thousands of bits oJ
leaves, each about half an inch in diam
eter. Upon turning over some of these
leaf fragments I found that the motive
power of each one was a big red ant, who
clung to it desperately, and a3 soon as re
leased took its place in the ranks again.
For many minutes I watched the verdant
procession, but it seemed no near the end
than when I first saw it.
Out of tbe dusky woods on one side the
path it emerged and into the depths of
the other it disappeared, traveling tire
lessly onward to some destination un
known to me. I could not very well trace
its course, the forest being so dense; but
there must have been millions of ants in
the column, all marching in perfect order
and evidently with some definite end in
view.
These insects, which are known as the
great-headed red ants, not only use their
powerful scissor jaws upon the leaves of
trees and plants, but should they find a
tablecloth or handkerchief or anything of
that kind on the ground, will cut out of it
neat little semi-circular holes, taking the
pieces away to their nests. Whether or
not they use these bits of cloth for lining
their nests, or put them to their proper
use as napkins and handkerchiefs, I can
not say.
Gabirvs of Shakes.
There are several kinds of structures in
California that are peculiar to the soil, but
most of them really belong to tbe early
inhabitants â the Indians and Mexicans.
The house of "shakes," however, came A
with the white man, and those who bui'^
the first of these structures most likely got
the idea from the sycamore shingle of
Flori da.
Many people do not know what a shake
is, so a little explanation will not be out
of order. Shakes are made from almost
any kind of wood, although some hard
variety is generally used. Logs of straight
grain are selected and cut into pieces
about three feet long. These are then
split into boards about four inches wido
and three-quarters of an inch thick. Of
course the boards are very rough and also
uneven, but possess great strength, as the
grain always runs from one end of it to
the other. When made of oaK it is
almost impossible to break one of them
crosswise.
The style of buiiding for which they are
used depends on the occupation of the
owner. Lumbermen, miners and sheep
herders are the most numerous of those
who use this style of structure. The
sheepherders' are perhaps the most pic
turesque and substantial and are generally
of the same shape as the one in the accom
panying drawing. They are usually lo
cated in some barren spot and used during
the feeding season. The miner generally
mazes his the same shape as tbe wedge
tent, which presents a grotesque appear
ance. Those built by the lumbermen are
often very elaborate, but since sawmills
have been located in the mountains they
are not as common as they were. Then?
is practically no wear out to this style <4f
structure. In time they become cover Ad
with a rich growth of moss, that com
pletely closes the cracks that originally
existed, so that they are impervious to the
hardest rains. In the mountainous dis
tricts of this State there are dozens of
shake cabins standing to-day that wen
built almost half a century ago.IN THE TREASURE HOUSE OF CALIFORNIA'S PIONEERS

WITHIN the space of a few square
feet, in this City, are such inestima

issued by Commodore Jrloat, immediately
preceded the raising of the American flag
ai Monterey when the United States
formally took possession of California and
saved it from the English; the bell which
sounded in earlier days to call the Vigi
lance Committee together; the saw, crank
and other paraphernalia from Sutter's
mill; the battle flag of the "First Califor

Thirty-second Regiment of New York
Volunteers; "Captain Jack's" war drum
from the lava beds; and not les3 inter
esting the cannon which, originally pre
sented by the Czar of Russia to the garri
son of Fort Ross, was afterward used by
Commodore Stockton at San Pedro, Los
Angeles and San Pasqual.
These are all in a museum, of course,
but a museum whicti, in a small compass,
embodies more State history than any
other museum in the United States. The
objects of historical interest already
enumerated, and many others, are in the
custody of the Society of California Pio
neers. Securely sheltered in a building
wnich is in itself historical, as it marks
one instance of the broadly manifested
public spirit of James Lick, the number of
these priceless treasures slowly increases.
Tragedies and comedies, relics of war and
reminders of stern justice meted out in
the spirit of but without the form of law,
provokers of smiles and reminiscences for
tears â these and the magic glitter of
that gold which made California so soon
a State, are in the keeping of their proper
custody, of those who were, in proprise
persona?, S'.ate-makers in every sense of
the term. When the collection is com
plete it will suggest the most unique page
of history that has been written in mod
ern times. They will help to make up the
most unique museum store upon earth.
Upon a pedestal in an an-ile stands a
small iron chest. The lid of it rattles
whenever the chest is jarred. It once had
a key and until a short time ago, in fact.
Then some chance visitor learning of the
historical value ot the chest stole the key.
The chest very likely would also have
been stolen by the same visitor if it had
not been protected by its size and weight.
Small though it is the story runs that it
contained $16,000 when it was stolen by
John Jenkins from the snipping office of
Virgin & Co. on Long wharf on the tenth
day of June, 1831. Jenkins had the con
spicuous distinction of being the first
man lynched to secure order by the Com
mittee of Vigilance. Jenkins was dealt
with very promptly and the proceedings
were t'.orouah and energetic. 'â¢Ho was
convicted," says a veracious chronicler,
ll that evening as an example to the law
less characters then infesting the City."
The committee brought him to the plaza
and there they hung him Irom a beam of
the old adobe house. He was left until
morning, relays of men holding the rope
by which he was suspended.
Close to this little iron chsst with
which Jenkins made away, and which was
saved from the bay after he had thrown it
in, is a perfect treasury of objects which
have histories. A little to the left, not
more than two paces, there is a queer
little cannon. It is perhaps 3}4 feet long.
The chamber of it runs to a point at the
\ent. Eight ounces of powder were
enough to charee it. On the top are what
looks like two handles to carry it by. The
. Czar of Russia presented this cannon to
the Russian garrison of Fort Ross and the
Russian flag waved over it for a time.
Captain Sntter afterward received it
He caused it to be mounted upon the wall
of his famous fort, a large picture of which
is almost directly over the cannon. The
piece was one of those which banged a
salute when the American flag waa first
raised upon that fort at sunrise on the
morning of July 12, 1847. Then it became
a held liece and went with the command
of Commodore Stockton and was used by
him in his advance from San Pedro to Los
Angeles; again in the engagement at San
Pasqual, December 6, 1846; again at Los
Angeles on the Bth and 'JAi of June, 1847.
It was then transferred to Colonel Mason
of the First United States Dragoons, who
returned it to Captain Sutter. He pre
sented it to the Society of California Pio
neers.
Just beyond a stout wire partition at
the east end of the museum there is a sec
tion of what looks like an old-fashioned
mast. In reality it is a four-foot section
of that flagstaff upon which Commodore
S'oat ordered Midshipman Toier to raise
tbe American fl-ig at Monterey, on the 7tu
day of July, 1b46. This section was the
base of the pole. A i>iece of the top part
is in another part of the museum; also
upon the wali, bearing the attestation re
cently placed thereupon by William P.
Toier, now of Oakland, is a long manu
script. This was the proclamation by j
which the United States took possession I
of California, and Mr. Toier attests that it ',
was written by his hand, at the order of :
Commodore Sloat, whose aid he was.
Pianos, like everything else connected
with the eariy period of California his

strong constitution. Almost under the
shadow of James iycK's .hatbox, which
rests on the top of the Sioat flagstaff sec
tion before mentioned, is the tirst piano
that ever came to California. Strange as
it may appear, as a fact, this first piano is
an upright. Steve Massett had it at some
of his entertainments. Along came the
big tire of 1850. The piano could only be
saved by throwing it to the ground from
a second-story window. Down it went
with a bang, jingling and tinkling out a
protest from every note included within
the compass of its eight octaves.
When the piano struck the ground one |
of its legs was broken off. It ought to |
have been a generally broken up music

discovery was made that, with the excep- j

stained ivory keys, and every note will
respond in tune. It has about as good
tone as it ever could have possessed. The
sound is practically the same that was
heard half a century ago when California
was new.
On the west wall, where it should be, is
the original Bear flag. There are three
bear flags of different dates on the walls.
The original bear is an odd-looking beast.
There is no doubt of the authenticity of
the relitâ the original flag. H. L. Ford
will go down to history as the man who
suggested placing a picture of the bear on
the flag. Mrs. John Sears provided the
muslin of which the flag was made. Wil
liam Todd agreed to paint it and placed on
it a single star, remembering the "lone
star" of the Texas Republic flag. Todd
was equal to painting the star, but when
he came to the bear he produced a picto
rial beast of subdued miÂ»n which can be
considered a bear only by Doetical license.
He would never have been suspected of
being a bear without a license. There are
two other bear flags of different periods.
One of the*e has a bear standing on its
iiindlegs. These three flags are spread out
in frames on the side walls. Not far away
from them is a flag carried by Walker into
Nicaragua. Over the last named is the
picture ot Dr. Tucker, who gave it to the
Pioneers.
At least one more flag of historical in
terest is in the collection. This was car
ried through several battles in the Civil
War at the head of the First California or
Thirty-second Regiment of New York
Volunteers. Two colonels were killed in
battle in command of this regiment while
yet the battle-flag was in use, these being
Colonel Matheson and Colonel Lemon.
The last colonel of the regiment,
Francis E. Pinte, gave it to
the Pioneers. It floated at Manassas,
West Point, Vn., Crumpton Gap. An
tietam, Fredericksburg and Salem Height,
Va. The wear of actual service is evident
upon its tattered folds.
The San Francisco Vigilance Committee
is represented in various parts of the mu
seum by enduring memorials. The largest
single object that belonged to that world
famous committee now in the Pioneer
building is the bell, which stands on a
pedestal just beyond the case that shelters
the California Regiment battle-flag. Mon
umental Fire Company No. 6 owned the
bell, and it was the first one ever erected
in San Francisco. The Vigilance Com
mittee used it in 1856, and to the ears of
offenders it played weird tunes. The
"all-seeing eye" and the seal and police
badge of the committee are in one case.
In another case is a very small, old-fash
ioned clock, not more than the span of a
l;and in diameter. This ticked out the
minutes at meetings which were full of
late to certain individuals. Taken to
gether tho bell and the clock are surely
grim reminders of an exciting period and
exciting occurrences.
There is one corner of the museum â a
small jog formed by the junction of a
wire barricade â which would provoke the
enthusiasm of any student of history.
Here are gathered a piece of the keelson
of the Natalie, the vessel upon which
Napoleon escaped from the island of Elba;
upon this wooden relic are pieces of the
machinery which went to make up Sut
ter's mill; above these hangs one of the
saws from that mill.
Crossed in a glass case in this same cor
ner are two torches which were presented
by friends in Philadelphia to Pennsyl
vania Fire Company No. 12 of San Fran
cisco in 1854. Somewhat gorgeous with
silver trimmings the handles proudly
claim to have been fabricated from the
tree under which William Perm wrote his
memorable treaty witn the Indians,
â¢'which was never sworn to and never
broken." Between the torches and Sut
ter's long-disused saw and machinery is
the quarterboard of the Loo Choo, one of
the vessels which brought to California a
part of Stevenson's regiment. G. B.
Mellus, who has charge of the Pioneer
Museum, once worked on the Loo Choo in
Boston as a sailmaker.
Mixed in with the historical treasures of
California are other objects, but tbe
creater part of all is purely Californian.
Two stone chairs of the Incas are there.
Then in a case are two miniature brass
cannons, made from a gun which was on
board of Nelson's flagship at Trafalgar.
General Grant's coat, the one which he
wore at the capture of VicKsburg, is In
evidence. This came from the Dent
family. There would have been many
smali cannon balls for the public to have
looked at but, incredible as it may seem,
the Dublic has btolen them. Bulky iron
mongery was flitted away as easily as a
k<*y of an iron box. Baskets or hand
satchels may have been used. No pocket
short of one lined with leather and
stitched with stout cord could carry away
even a small cannon ball. So several per
son?, tourists or others, have taken part
in looting a pile of cannon balls.
The Vigilance Committee badge of 1856
is present only in one specimen. This is>
on white ribbon and bears only the lol
lowing: I
KINO GUARDS.

V. C.
A daguerrotype of Kit Carson, the
famous frontiersman, is near neighbor to
James Lick's stone teapot and the dies
from which nÂ«oney in California were
stamped in tha early days. The chain
with whioh Jasper O'Farrell surveyed San
Francisco in 1844 rests qnietly in a show
case corner. Most characteristic of all,
perhaps, is a box containing the remains
of a pioneer's outfit in 1849. The box is
small enough to be turned into a waffle.
In it are a small roll of tape, a cake of
soap, i-mall white buttons, one threaded
needle and two copper cents. Almost
jostling against it is a slate bowl used by
the padres to hold holy water.
There are busts and pictures galore.
Ona large picture shows odd features of
the journey over the istnmus. There are
many portraits of well-known pioneers
and views of San Francisco and Sacra
mento at different Vimes; cases of glitter
ing ores, some samples having more or
less interesting histories. Odds and ends
from the South Seas havo space to cling
to, bows and arrow?, etc.
Old men haunt the rooms, gray haired
and with other marks of old age visibly
creeping on. They enter through the
office on the first floor, passing other gray
haired men who occupy official positions.
Tli3n they pass along through a wide hall,
which is decorated in part with a mural
tablet of marble, upon which have been
sculptured the names of all the presidents
of the Society of California Pioneers down
to the present time. They climb slowly
up easy flights of stairs, seeing the por
traits of famous Californians on every
side.
When they have reached the third floor
they have no Jurther to climb. Many of
them walk with canes. Mr. Pinkham, the
marshal, does not. Neither does Captain
Swasey, who is as erect and seemingly as
alert as when he first saw San Fran
cisco, fifty-one years ago. Around them
are more mute records of darineand hero
ism, of wild adv enture, than any other
single society on earth can justly claim
for their own â as appertaining directly to
themselvesâ in which they were the actors.
Midway of the museum is a small glit
tering particle. Never taken from the
soil, it nevertheless is the counterfeit pre
sentment of that which caused thousands
of men to sail around Cape Horn, to jour
ney over deserts and mountains, to cross
the isthmus and to delve through days
filled with toil and glory in the auriferous
soil of California. A small, plush-covered
box, with a tiny clasp, if> beneath the
Rparkling trifle. It is locked up securely
in a showcase. Not of great intrinsic
value, it is still of great value in the eyes
of pioneers, for it is a fac-simile of the
first nugget connected with the name of
Marshall, the discoverer of Cali fornia
gold. David H. Walker.
Buying a J-lorse for 70 Cents.
A horse for 70 cents !
A real live animal, capable of drawing s
peddler's cart and its owner for a price
less than six bits.
McCurrie, special officer for the Preven
tion of Cruelty to Animals in the City and
County of San Francisco, has found
the oddest horse trade that has come to
notice in a long time.
'â¢I forget who the peddler was," McCur
rie said yesterday, "but I know about the
lowest-priced horse that ever has assisted
any man in San Francisco to carry on
business."
McCurrie has every day contact with
horses all over the City and, as might be
supposed, it is a fact that tbe poorer
horses are those which are the most sub
ject to abuse and so attract his attention
more closely, the complaints being princi
pally against the owners of such.
"Of course this wa3 a cash trade," said
McCurrie, with some amusement. "The
money paid over was two quarters, one
dime and two nickels. When the owner
of the nag received this money the ped
dler got the horse sure enough and was
ready for business."
"The fact is that peddlers can get all the
horses they want now for $1 each. I
knew of another case where a horse was
bought by a peddier for an old stove
which was much tbe worse for wear; the
stove, I mean, and for $1 in cash."
Some inquiry was made on the basis of
McCurrie's statements. The fact appears to
be that many horses have been bought for
less than $5. Sorry-looking nags, of conrse,
these are, but they do to move a load of
bananas or other truck for sale over short
distances on the level streets of the City,
and they are able to stand at street cor
ners indefinitely on anywhere from three
to four legs. But a sharp lookout is kept
upon such animals and upon their ownera
by the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals.
There was an example of this watchful
ness one day during the past week. A
human brute was driving four horses with
a heavy load attached to them and it was
noticed that one of the leaders could not
step on one fore foot without pain. The
horses were stopped and it was discovered
that the ailing horse had just been shod
and that a nail had been driven into its
foot, upon which it had been forced by
blows to walk over the cobbles.
The suggestion has often been made
that California is the place for the poor
man. There probably is no other place
where peddlers can get the motive power
for their wares at the rate of a horse lor
7C cents.

A CHRISTMAS DANCE.
A Pleasant Evening With the
Little Folks on Fairy Lawn.
FAIRIES, elves, goblins and all the delight
ful characters that roam through the
pages of childish lore met and sang and
romped and danced on the stage of California
Hall Tuesday evening, for the annual exhibi
tion of the juvenile class of Irvine's Academy.
Mother (ioose, Cinderella, Ala<ldin, Little
80-peep, Red Ridinghood, Little Boy Blue,
Humpty-Dumpty, Jill and Jack were all there,
surrounded by iairits or spangles and gauze,
each prettier than the other.
"The Children's Christmas Dream," an oper
etta interspersed with melody ana ensemble
dancing, was the first number the little ones
presented. The hall was crowded to the doors
and applause was loud mid unstinted.
Following the lairy piny came a tnwildering
variety of lancy dances. To' Miss Victory Orr
assuredly went the honor due to a premier
danseuse. Miss Oaire White, a graceful little
tot, danced the hornpipe with a charming
abandon and also appeared to advantage iv
the class dances. It would be hardiy fair to
particularize, though, for each dan'co and
dancer was worthy of special mention. The

ON A WHEEL IN
INTERIOR CHINA
Some Rough Experiences
by E. W. yon Dovane,
Now Here.
Was Once Rushed Into Prison
in Order to Be Saved From
a Mob.
The Hard Life of Missionaries Remote
From the Coastâ Going Now
to M zico.
E. W. yon Frederick Dovane, a bicyclist
of New York, who claims to have wheeled
all the way to Tacoma, via Denver, and
who has now come from China, after pene
trating to the center of that country, is at
the New Western Hotel. He proposes
soon leaving on his wheel for fc-'outhern
California and crossing Mexico. Dovane
says he had some curious experiences in
China which were spiced sufficiently with
danger to keep him ever on the alert. He
landed at Shanghai and thence began his
trip.
"I had taken two wheels with me, and
for this I soon had occasion to rejoice,"
said he, "for twenty miles south of Shang
hai I fell twenty feet down while sitting
straight up on my wheel, it break
ing in a dozen different places. I had to
walk back to Shanghai aud get my new
wheel. The roails alon? the coast were
mo-tly fair and tne pigtails fairly polite.
"But it was different in the interior,
where I went for 200 miles. I soon had
occasion to see Chinamen in all their
stupi'liiy and superstition. None sur
t>assed in this way the inhabitants of
Yang Yua, a village of about 6000 people.
As soon as I came into town the people
began to crowd around me. The pave
ment of the streets is mostly so bad that
there is no chance to ride a bicycle. It is
difficult enough to walk.
"The people here never had seen a bicy
cle and surely thought me some kind of
their numerous dcvi s. The crowd around
me was so thick I couldn't move any more.
"Having come to a standstill tne people
got very inquisitive and tried to take my
wheel away. It becoming a little 100 se
rious I pulled out my revolver and shot
over their heads. This gave me a little
room and holding on to my bicycle 1
dashed forward through the crowd trying
to find the south end of the town. But on
account of the crooked streets, which pre
vail in all the Chinese towns, I could not
hnd it and came back to the same place I
had started from.
"The infuriated mob seemed to hare
known that I had missed the exit because
they were waiting for me.
"As soon as I got near enough stones,
old eggs and other things came tlying
very thickly. I shot again over their heads
Dut" without result, the crowd growing
larger and larger and more infuriated.
Now I thought my last minute had come.
But I did not get a chance to kill any Chi
namen because the Yamen (Mayor of the
town) came with a dozen soldiers and
rescued me and took me to prison over
night to keep me safe from the mob. Till
midnight I could hear the roar of the peo
ple before the gate of the prison.
"At 3 o'clock in the morning the Yamen

I had to buy a lantern, nobody being al
lowed to so without a lantern after sun
down. 1 had treat trouble in every town
; about my passport, which 1 had to take to
the Yamen. The first trouble was to rind
him, since I was often not able to make
myself understood. When I came to one

as he did not know what to do with the

all over China. The town consists of
about 1000 boats on the river, where the
Chinamen live all their lives. From there
I went to Hongkong, situated, as is
known, on an inland, opposite Canton.
There 1 had the pleasure of again seeing
Americans. The only white men I saw in
the interior were the missionaries, who
lead here a very miserable life."
FOR FOREIGN PAIRS.
Help to ltc Svctiiprt for State
Abroad.
The Finance Committee of the Board of
Supervisors listened favorably yesterday
afternoon to requests for appropriations
for San Francisco exhibits contemplated
at a Central American and at a German
exposition. While it did not grant the
money forthwith it was understood that
an effort will be made to find the funds from
which the two amoants may be taken.
The county of San Francisco allows
$2500 a year for advertising purposes. Two
representative committees appeared before
the Finance Committee and together en
deavored, to secure a goodly part of the
amount. One committee, working in the
interests of a display of San Francisco
goods to be made at the coming Guate
mala exposition, wanted $1500, and its ar
guments were advanced by Secretary Carl
H. Clark of the Guatemala exposition, C.
R. Bundschu, E. R. Lilenthal, N. W.
Spalding and others; the other commit
tee, representing the Btate Board of Trade,
was after $1000 to be used upon a Califor
nia exhibit at the horticultural exposition
at Hamburg, Germany, next year. Sec
retary J. Filcher, J. E." Emery, L. 0. Me-
Afeo, J. B. Lanksrshimof Los Angeles, R.
H. Ryan and N. P. Batchelder were on
the latter committee.
An Abandoned Child.
A little child was abandoned on the corner
of Turk and Laguna streets Friday evening in
a most peculiar manner. The mother, Mrs. Jane
Kausch, was seen to leavo it on the street
corner and walk away. A gentleman who saw
her made her take the child again, and then
she left it In the nearest grocery-store anddis
appeÃred. The child was taken to the Receiv
ing Hospital. About eight months ago the
woman's husband left her and since then sho
has been arrested for cruelty so her children.
She was then sentenced to six months' im
prisonment. She is believed to be insane.
The abandoned child is about 5 months old.

nomination for President, were Edwin P.
Danfortii Jr., Colonel W. H. Chamberlain,
(t. B. Knowles, B. B. Keilogg and R. B.
Woodward, when the subj-ct branched
jnto politics. Mr. Danforth sugeesied the
formation of a Blains Republican Club.
The suggestion was deemed a good one,
acd after an exchange of ideas it was de
cided to call the organization the Dirigo
Club and to take none in as members but
young men of the very h^st standing in
the City, and that the initiation fee be
ii^ed nt"s2s and dues at $10 per month.
On this basis the Dingo Club was organ
ized with the following-mmed gentlemen
as charter members: W. H. Chamber

The by-laws provided thÂ« no greater

members.
The Dirigos remained an active political

John Cafferty, ex-Pu ir*t, Uses His
Strength on Children.
Johnny Cafferty, aged 9 years, was taken
on Friday from his Home on Sussex street
to the office of the Society for the Preven
tion of Cruelty to Children by Officer Mc-
Murray. Here the officer nested him
to disrobe that severe bruises inflicted
upon him by his erne! father might be
seen by the officers of the humane society
and by a representative of The Call.
When the body of the poor child was
brought to view there was a chorus of ex
clamations of horror and disgust. The
child's shoulder-blades protruded, his

PENMAN EPPINGER.
Sentenced to State Prison for Twelve
Years by Judge Wallace.
Judge Wallace on Friday sentenced W.
L. Eppinger to nerve twelve years in the
State Prison at San Quentin for uttering
and passing a fictitious checK.
The Eppinger case has been in Judge
Wallace's court for nearly four years and
this is the fourth time that he has been
sentenced, so he has in a measure become
accustomed to that ordeal.
Attorney H. G. W. Dinkelspiel and
Wslliam M. Cannon earnestly interceded
for Eppinger, urging that clemency be
extended by the court. The prisoner ad
dressed the court in his own behalf. He
declared that he had already been pun
ished enough, even if he had been guilty.
In conclusion he vehemently asserted his
innocence and declared that he would yet
prove the existence of the man M- Howell,
whoÂ«e name was on the check.
"If you do that the Governor will
pardon you," replied judge Wallace.
During the proceedings an nffi lavit was
offered, sinned by George Wiebman, to
the effect that tbe affiant know M. Howell,
the alleged indor^er of the check.
Judge Wallace asked where the affidavit
was made, and when told that it was
sworn to in Mann County the Judge
asked that it b^ submitted for his exami
nation. It surued out that Wichrnan is a
i'ellow-onvict and the atlidavit was made
in ban Quentin at Eppinger's request, so
it was not considered.
In passing sentence Judge Wallace said
be wouid take into consideration the time
already served by Eppinger and his good
record at San Quentin. The original sen
tence was :or fourteen years. A credit of
two years would oe ailowe 1 and the pris
oher would be required to serve only
twelve more years.
CARFARES MAY GO DOWN
Attorney-General Nearly Ready
to Make an Issue on the
Subject.
Then the Market-Street Railway May
Be Compelled to Show Its Books
and Accounts.
Within a few days, in all probability,
the Supreme Court will be asked lo issue
a writ of mandate at the instance of At
torney-General Fitzgerald, acting for the
Board of Railroad Commissioners, to com
pel the Market-street Railway Company
to submit its books and accounts to the
Commissioners.
To reacii this end a cetition will be filed
and also a brief in support of the petition
for the writ. It is an open secret that
Attorney-General Fitzgerald has been at
work o;i these papers for some time, de
voting a great deal of study to the subject.
The information is authentic that the end
of this labor has been about reached. At
torney Fitzgerald would neither affirm nor
deny yesterday that the papers were about
ready to rile, but there is little doubt '-hat
such is the fact.
The question which will be decided in
chief is whether a street railway line is a
transportation company as contemplated
under the State constitution. If the
Supreme Court shall decide this question
in the aifirmative the jurisdiction of the
Board of Railroad Commissioners over
street railways would appear U> be estab
lished. Asking that t:e Market-street
Railway Company snail be ordered to
show its books and accounts will raise the
main question, and this is therefore the
principal point of contention.
The Railroad Commissioners believe
that they have the risht and it is their
duty to have knowledge of and control of
rate-makine over the street railways of
the State. The action of the court will
have v wide application, for if the Market
street Railway Company can be made to
yield obedience all other street railway
lines in the State will necessarily have
only the same status. The Commissioners
liave not adopted any resolutions estab
lishing a rate for transportation on any
street railway. Further action wiil de
pend upon the decision of the Supreme
Court, Which must define the constitu
tional position and powers of the board
in this regard.

Gallir\g for Jrumps /Abused.
There is no play in the game of whist thnt is
so much abused as calling for trumps. As a
trick-losing play it has no equal emong those
that never study the game. We have seen
players wriggle around in their seats and
couldn't keep quiet until, they finished their
"call"; even then would not wait until, the
deal was played out before they would ast,
"Did you see my call?" nnd to them, that was
the essence of the play of that deal. The cum
ber of tricks they lost cut no figure. The fol
lowing is from the Rochester Post:
rSE THE SIGNAL CAREFULLY.
A common fault among whist-players of â¢
moderate ability is the frequent use of the
trump signal. As players become more and j
more proficient they use the signal less and j
less. But the beginner, who prides himself i
upon being able to see a signal, is always in a |
hurry to make one, and the result is usually a i
loss of tricks.' It is specially important not to
start a signal if you have only two cards and i
so are forced to complete it on tho next round j
of the suit â unless you are so very strong in j
the trump suit that the development does not j
matter. On this subject George L. Bunn says !
in the St. Paul Globe : , I
"The call for trumps is a valuable weapon, j
but it should be used with judgment. The
idea that a player must display his knowledge {
of this simple artifice just because he happens j
to hold great trump strength should bo aban- :
doned by those who hope ever to play a good |
game of whist. One very frequent situation j
where a call ought not to be made, yet often
is. Is where the trump hand's partner opens
with the ace of a plain suit, and the trump j
hand has two small cards of that suit and rfi \
suit of his own that requires trump exhaust- J
ing. In these case;, if the leader follows with |
a king the call must be completed and tho
leader must respond at once, probably leaving
his suit unes tablished and . rendering; the
making of tho small cards of it Impossible
without the presence of two cards of re-ei'try, ]
whereas by , continuing the suit â â  for a third
round it will be established and but one re- |
entry card lis needed to bring it in if partner I
can exhaust the trumps." '

I^STOREOPEN EVENINGS FOR THE BALANCE OF HOLIDAY SEASON.
\g{J Murphy Building, Â£
Market aad Jones Streeti
give avove was played in St. Paul a few even- ,
ings ago.
It contains several whist lessons that ought ;
to b? learned. The return of partner's suit; j
not. to put too much confidence in the honesty |
with which a wily opponent pl.ays hiscards;
an easy lesson in counting the hands. It also
shows that a false card play may be very I
aendly against poor opponents, while of no use j
against fine players, and that the snfest guard j
against ialse-cardiug is watching the drop for
other indications.
The comments on the play are by Mr. Bunn.
and it is in reading the comments that we eet
the whist instruction.
Trick 2â West's trump lead is sound.
Trick 3â We should not play king second
hand in this situation. West cannot lead
trump.- again advantageously, but he woula
like to have his partner get the lend and re
turn the trump. \Vei,t does not want tho lead
and should play low.
Trick 4â there are excellent reasons why
North should return his partner's suit. His
own suit is strong, but he is weak in trumps
aad has no re-entry. He should return ciub to
give South a fiueÂ«-e. The play of kingsecond
hand has disclosed West's weakness, and a lead
up to him may result in a force, which will
prevent the making of the spade suit
Trick sâ West sees that the diamond suit Is
completely established against him and avoids
a secona lead of trumDS.
Trick 6â A curious talse-cnrd p!ay made !
with a double object. East decides not to re
turn the trump ns one of the adversnrles must
have held at least four nnd partner was not |
strong enough to continue the lead. East can- j
not lead spades, for the weak hand wiil trump
and the sirring hand get a discard ; he does not
like to lead a diamond up to North's strength.
He decides lo return the club through the
strong and leads the nine from j.-ick, nine,
four. His idea is that South will play him for
returning the highest of two and will place
jack with West or North and go up with
queen. While if he leads a low card South
wiil be sure to pass. We think that South on
principle should have passed the nino or gone
up with queen, for it cartainiy seems impossi
ble for him to decipher East's play and his
subsequent play shows that he did not.
Trick Bâ North plays dangerously ia return
ing ttie trump. There can be no gain unless
South holds both ace and king, and there may
be a decided loss if he doe 3 not hold ace.
North should mace a sure thing of the hand
by returning the club.
Trick I.lâ East's false club lead at trick 6
fixed the position of the clubs in Souths
mind, and he was apparently so certain that
his partner held jack of clubs that he did not
note his discard at trick 10. The threo of dia
monds shows that North had originally five
cards oi that suit, and that, therefore, his
three remaining cards are all diamonds, and
the jack of clubs must be with East. South [
failed to read a very simple situation and ;
threw three tricks at East. Of course West j
takes the opportunity to get rid of the ten of i
spades, giving East a clean field with his nine
and eight.
fetaluma Whist Tournament.
Monday eveniqg last the combined whist
cluds of Petaluma started in on a three days'
tournament in the rooms of Petaluma Social

Whist Editor Call: I have noticed your gen
erous offer in regard to your "Whist Don'ts,"
and I wish, in benalf of a few ladies and my
self, to be among the favored recipients. If
you could send a half dozen copies of the
pamphlet which you mention In a late
number of The Call they would be most
gratefully appreciated. We wish you had a
price on your work, as we would feel more
roady to ask for them. The whist articles are
eagerly read nnd studied, for the profit and
pleasure of which please receive our thanks.
Most cordially yours, E. E. S.
Editor â Everything comes to him who waits.
Oar "Whist Don'ts" will be ready in about two

Oakland Whist NeWs.
The return game, ladles against gentlemen,
took place in the Oakland Whist rooms last
Monday evening, the ladies winning the
match by eight tricks. Some of the gentlemen
are under the impression that a few of the â 
boards were turned in the wrong direction,
but the ladies say it was only the "tables" that
were turned.
The second game between the San Francisco !
and Oakland ladies' teams of four was played j
off on Thursday la?t, the Oakland ladies scor
inc another victory bj - seven tricks.
A team of ladies from the Trist Club in
tended crossing lances with the Oakland
ladies during the past week, but no mutually
asreeoDle date could be made and the play
has been postponed for the present.
The tournament committee of the Oakland
Club gnve the members an opportunity to try
llieir skill on the hand that appeared in The
Call last Sunday and it created a great deal of
discussion. It seems to be the general opinion
that twelve tricks ought to be made by North
and South, providing a good strong vein of j
perception is brought into action as the play
of the hand develops the situation.
The Oakland Club evidently wants one or
more of those trophies now held by the San
Fr.inciscos. as they sent over teams last even- j
ing to play for both the Rideout and the Payot
cups.
The Linda Vista Whist Club.
The annual meeting of the Linda Vista Whist
Club was held at the residence of President R.
B. Calley, on the Heights. It was also the open
ing of the season's play. The election of offi
cers for the ensuing year took place. Mr. Cal
ley could not be persuaded to avcept tha office
for another term [he is a man after our own
heart.â Ed.], and Mr. Coffin succeeds him. S.
J. Taylor was elected secretary and treasurer
and E. A. Heron was chosen vice-president.
After the election of officers two hours were
spent at the silent game. Then from labor to
refreshments, where Mrs. (tolley was chosen
to preside. She quietly remiVked that during
this game over which she presided the players
could lead from any suit, long or short, but
hoped tney all had elastic suits.

Strange stories are told of the weather

Seven candidates for Aldermen in Bos

of course it would have been regarded as a
bluff and called accordingly.
An agitation has been started in Eng
land to induce the Government to store up
a large grain supply for the use of the
people in case of war. The movement is
not altogether a foolish one, for there are
possibilities that in a war England's su

her and her people starved into surrender.
It is reported that Japan is going to send
a war-vessel to the Philippine Islands to
look after the interests of her people dur

a debating society whether Japan or the
United States has shown the better judg
ment.
THE BEET-SUGAR INDUSTRY.
The return of the Republican party to
power next year will be followed by
largely increased protection by new tariff
laws, and the claims of the beet-sngar
industry to a prominent place on the list
of those deserving to be fostered should
be strongly urged upon Congress.
Sugar is one of the great farm products
with which the United States fails to
supply even her home market. Its produc
tion from beet 3 has increased till it now
far exceeds the yield from cane. The
sugar beet can be grown in many parts of
this country and its cultivation only needs
encouragement to make the home supply
of sugar at least equal to home consump
tion.
A protective tariff on susar would
hasten its introduction to new localities,
and would offset the unjust discrimina
tion made dv Europ an nations against
some products of our farms under the pre
tense of sanitary policing. It would be a
protection in which the farmer would di
rectly share, and in it he could readily ace
the benefits of protection generally.
Even from tbe standpoint of the advo
cates of a tariff for revenue, a higher duty
on sugar would be advisable. The lact
cannot be overlooked in the present need
of increasing the income of the Govern
ment to make it equal to the necessary
expenditures. The broader and better
ground on which higher sugar duty is
urged, however, is that of protection to
tnis great industry. It is in no wise sec
tional. North and South, East and West
alike are interested in it, and it will be
for the benefit of all to promote it and
protect it.
To the people of California the subject
is one of vast importance. The produc
tion of sugar is already one of the largest
industries of the State and has in it the
possibility of becoming the very largest.
In the complex proc sses of its work it
gives employment to all grades of labor
from the farmhands who gatner the beets
to the scientific and skilled worurnen who
transmute their juices into sugar. The
product, moreover, is one of universal use.
It is consumed in large quantities in
every household and has become one of
tbe prime necessities of civilized man.
Thanks to the energy, the skill and the
public spirit of Claus Spreckels, the in
dustry has been advanced to great propor
tions in California and is still going
forward. He is now erec;ing the largest
and best-equipped sucar-producing plant
in the world near Salinas, and if the in
dustry be properly guarded from unfair
foreign competition he will make this
State the greatest sugar-producing region
on earth.
Since so much capital is already in
vested in the enterprise it is the duty of
Californians in Congress to guard it by all
means in their power. The responsibility
of this duty becomes augmented when we
consider the prospective growth of the
industry. With such an industrial
general ac Claus Spreccels io lead the way
California needs nothing but a fair degree
of protection for her sugar-workers to
produce all the sugar used in America,
thus enriching herself, givin~ employ
ment to her labor, providing profits lor
her farmers and saving to the United
States every year millions of dollars now
sent abroad for the sugar of foreign lands.
THE HORSE SHOW.
In the ereat success of the third annual
horse show San Francisco has good reason
to congratulate herself. The display of
equine beauty and training, the splendid
horsemanship, the magnificence of the
many kinds of vehicles, the loveliness of
California ladies crowning all, made up a
show superlative in its excellence.
We are told that the age of electric car
riages is close upon us; we s c in the bi
cycle that men are much given to me
chanical methods of locomotion, and there
is talk of the passing of the horse, but as
long as men have hearts the horse will
never pass from their admiring possession
and lovinccare. The. desire tv ride and to
drive something live and lovable will
surely not give way altogether to the
utilities of machine-traveling unless men
become themselves little more than ma
chines.
The display in all clashes at the show
was very creditable to our horsemen, and
the people of California may bB proud and
glad of this proof that bo mucb. of tie
wealth and energy of the State has been
used to the encouragement oi horse-breed
ing.
In the tanbnrk rincr of the Pavilion the
continuous succession of attractions for
four days wa3 worth traveling far to see.
From the tiny, dandy, dancing ponies,
pleasing to all, but specially to the chil
dren, all through the programme up to
the ponderous drafthorses with their great
breasts and broad loins, the scene was
delightful in it 3 interest and beauty.
The proud stallions with pawing hoofs
and necks "clothed with thunder"; the
well-bred saddlers, which in every move
ment gave the beholder a s-nse of how
they can send the thrill of their own snlen
d.d vitality into the pulses of their riders;
the swift, easy, graceful gliding of the
high-headed roadsters as they drew the
airily light and noiseless modern vehicles;
the stylish bearing of the high-stepping
and highly trained tandem performers;
the stately swing of the carriage horses
with their satin skins and the glitter and
pleasing jingle of their costly harness; the
thundering ru^h of our fire horses as they
dashed three abreast into the ring with
startling suddenness; the pomp of the
matched four-in-hands pulling grand
coaches and haughtily conscious of their
glory, all this, togetner with the equestrian
mastery of the men who "witched the
world with noble horsemanship," made up
a pleasure giving which will linger long in
the memories of those who enjoyed it.
May every return of the show be marked
by increasing splerrdor.
AN AMICABLE SETTLEMENT.
The amicable settlement of the diffi
culties between the Pacific Rolling-mill
Company and its men, which for a time
threatened to produce a serious strike, is
a matter of no little gratification to the
whole City. This is no time for the be
ginning of any misunderstandings be
tween labor and capital in California. We
are on the verge of a new era of pros
perity, but it will not come to us unless
all who are engaged in our industries can
work together in harmony.
The action of both parties to the contro
versy in this instance has been wise.
Neither the men nor theiremp'oyers have
demanded from the other a complete sur
render. After a fall discussion of the
situation on both sides, terms have been
agreed upon which are fair to each. The
men therefore will return to work and the
mills will go forward as usual. There will
be some reduction in wages, but this the
men recognize is necessary in order that
the industry of the mills may be carried
on with profit, and it wili not seriously
affect any large number ol employes.
Intelligent workinemen understand that
the evil conditions oi the Democratic tariff
still affect American industries, and that
we cannot return at once to the prosper
ous conditions which prevailed under the
McKinley tariff. It will require some
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1896.
time for us to get back to the level of
profits and wages which prevailed under
the protective system. This, however, is
something we can look forward to in the
near future, and in the meantime both
labor and capital must be content to do
the best they can und^r existing circum
stances.
The friendly spirit which prevails be
tween the men and the Pacific Rolling
mill Company sinco the arrangement of
the terms of resuming work is made evi
dent by the statement of Mr. McMahon, a
foreman of tho mill, who, in speaking of
the reduction ie wages, saia: "It is just
this way. The price of iron is low and tne
price of labor in the East is low, and to
compete here the price of labor had to be
cut. Mr. Noble has always put up wages
when the price of iron warrants it. I
have seen it done three times voluntarily
in this mill."
The examulo thus set will doubtless have
its effect in any future difficulties between
capital and labor in this State and will go
far toward inducing both parties to ar
range some amicable solution for them.
It gives promise, therefore, of a completer
harmony between employers and em
ployes in the great industries of the State
and may be counted as a good augury for
the advancement of the manufacturing
interests of California in the approaching
revival of industry and prosperity which
will follow the re-enactment of a protec
tive tariff.
THE CUBAN QUESTION.
The Cuban problem h3S been promptly
brought to the front in the Senate, but
not in a manner that will give satisfaction
to any great number of the American
people. The speeches made by Senators
in favor of Cuban independence have been
full of expressions of sympathy, but
wholly lacking in suggestions of any
policy of decided action. Even Senator
Cullom, who made the most elaborate
speech on the subject and was most tiery
in his decimations, had nothing definite
to advocate. All that he could say was
this:
The wisdom and discretion of an American
President and Cabinet can safely nnd a way
to determine the trouble without imperiling
the interest of our country or our people. I
have little choice or preference as to the par
ticular method, but I do want, and I know the
public expects, a settlement on a humane and
just basis. The United States can do no less
than to initiate this effort for humanity and
liberty.
It is easy enough ior a "Senator to say
that an American President and Cabinet
can find a way of bringing about the inde
pendence of Cuba without imperiling any
interest of this country, but the adminis
tration would no doubt be better pleased
if some Senator would point out just how
this task is to be accomplished. Senator
Cuilum was right enough in saying the
country expects a settlement of the pro
longed war in Cuba on a humane and just
basis, but up to this time the public has
not been informed by any statesman of a
way in which these expectations can be
speedily realized.
It is conceded on all sides that the
problem is not one easy of solution. It
can inver be solved by sentimental ap
peals nor by any florid declamation con
cerning the rights of humanity and tho
duty of the American people to maintain
them in all parts of this hemisphere. The
practical issue seems to be the simple one
of whether we shall enter into a war with
Spain to establish the independence of
Cuba. It is to that issue the Senators
should direct themselves, and if they are
not going to deal with it definitely, they
bad better leave the subject alone.
It is not at all probable that the Spanish
Government would abandon Cuba under
a simple threat of war ou the part of the
United States. The Spaniards would fight
to some extent if for nothing else than to
gratify that national pride which is one
of their most salient characteristics. Our
interference, moreover, no matter on wbat
grounds it might be based, would not re
ceive sympathy in Europe, and we can
hardly believe that Senator Cullom was
serious when he declared: "We shall
not stand alone in the warfare which may
follow in behalf of common humanity.
Nation alter nation will make a joint
cau.-e with us in such a struggle."
The war in Cuba has been prolonged un
til it is now rapidly becoming a struggle
of extermination between foes so embit
tered they bave ceased to re^ar ! the rules
of cvihzed warfare. It is to our interest
as well a^ to the welfare of humanity that
this struggle should be checked, and the
people of that beautiful island secured in
th'- blessings which peace gives to indus
try. The American people will welcome
witii g a'lnes^ any declaration of National
policy which tends to bring about that re
sult. They are tired, however, of mere de
clamations on the subject. The Senators
should either formulate a plan of action
for the Government to pursue, or should
turn aside from the isdue and devote their
time to a consideration of those questions
of Home politics which are now awaiting
solution.
A NOVEL WAIST.
A stunning gown of red cloth had the waist
made in a very picturesque style, tne left side
overlapping in a draped effect. A deep
corselet belt of black satin was worn with this
striking costume. Another unusual feature of
this wai^t was the overlapping revers or col-
Irts of the cloth, which gave a fichu effect in
front.
The sleeves were of red silk matching the
cloth, and made with two deep tucks at the
top, the lower pnrt being arranged in scant
puffs.
The skirt was made perfectly plain of the
cloth. (No pattern.)

SCORED BY UPRIGHT JOURNALISTS
The Vile Methods of the "Examiner" Arouse
Righteous Indignation.
While the Danger to Publx Morals Is Great, a Way to
Effectually Check It Is Suggested
THE REAL ENEMIES IT HAS MADE.
Manifestly, there abides with the Examiner either a hearty contempt of
public opinion as it finds expression among decent, sober, fair-minded men,
or else it is enveloped by an atmosphere of such impregnable ignorance con
cerning the true state of the public mind toward itself as to obscure its vision
and confound its judgment. A snort time ago, as a matter of boastful pride,
it published a cartoon that purported to picture a few of the enemies it had
made, and it was pleased to add in a jocular way that it "was proud of 'em.' 1
Its enemies among respectable people, who were omitted from this list, could
scarcely be crowded into an entire edition of that paper. The individual who
guides the course and destiny of that remarkable journal must dive deeper
down into the current of public feeling if he would learn the exact truth. Let
him don a disguise and move around among the substantial mercantile men
of the City, and he will marvel much at the revelations of the Examiner's un
popularity that will come to him from the element of society that is conceded
to be conservative and law-abiding. That the subscription list of the Examiner
has suffered through its recent performances is an open secret Its young men
bave been moved to declare in a complaining voice that "the railroad is ex
pending larce sums of money to diminish its circulation," trusting that this
weau explanation will distract attention from this own misfeasance. Of course,
such charges are the cheapest kind of fol de rol, and besides being foui.da
tionle-s, are stupid as well.
The respectable press of the State has lately been directing criticism at the
Examiner's methods and its character. To most men attacks such as these
would suggest an exercise of prudence, but not so with the Examiner. It re
printed extracts from a number of these contemporaries, and attempted to
dismiss the charges in an off hand, matter-of-fact way by declaring all its
critics to be "railroad hirelings," which, it said, accounted for the venom they
displayed. As usual, the "railroad" is responsible; but certainly our "octo
pus" has not procured the New York Life, Frank Leslie's Weekly, the New York
Sun, the New York Post and all the host of manly and high-minded publica
tions in Am- rica to attack the character of journalism for which the Examiner
stands sponsor in the West, and the Journal, its wet-nurse, in the East. Even
business rivalry could not produce the s;orm of denunciatory protest that has
fallen about this type of journalism. It is outraged decency that is speaking.
It is tne respectable element of a hitherto honorable profession resenting the
introduction of the cowardly, contemptible and infamous methods that
threaten to drag that profession down from the high place it once held in
the estimation of the public. If this character of newspaper is to prevail and
succeed, then may we bid good-by to journalism as an honorable profession.
The storied torch of wisdom, held high by a heroic and Minervan maiden for
the enlightenment of mankind, no longer typifies the new press that kicks and
knocks with noisy clamor at our doors.
The reeking, gory, slimy thing with tawdry tinsel is not the press our
fathers knew. The enlightened torch of wisdom points heavenward no longer;
the flame dips downward now, and has become the firebrand of an incendiary.
The heroic maiden has jiiven way to a wicked, leering, unregenerate wench,
who fires the evil passions of mankind, who blisters honor, who enkindles
hatreds, who sears and scars with devilish delight and malice the reputation of
our citizens. Sensation has taken the place of Truth, and Corruption and
Vice sit where wisdom once held sway. Men are no longer led along the
highways of Decency, no longer taught that Virtue is a sacred thing. The
torch no longer lights their way along tbe avenues of Honor ana of Fame, but
drives them huddling down the dark and narrow byways of indecency and
hate. Under the new state of affairs the press must neither educate nor
elevate. It is to'be a obstructionist and a marplot, to breed discontent and
foment strife, to encourage and suggest crime and wrongdoing, manuring it
meanwhile from the dungheap of social scandals. Journals having these
tendencies could not subsist wholly upon the patronage of tbe depraved and
evil of the community. It is profitable to deal in this kind of sensationalism
only because respectability refuses to administer the rebuke which it deserves.
The moment the element of loss creeps in, that moment, and not until then,
will we be rid of it.
WE HEAR THE NEWS,
A number of papers published in this State have recently commented edi
torially on the marked decadence observable in the San Francisco Examiner.
That journal republishes a number of the excerpts and gravely assures its
readers that all the papers quoted *'are known to have been subsidized by the
Southern Pacific interestsâ sometimes to be actually supported by the South
ern Pacific."
The Blade happens to be one of the papers which are thus referred to. The
important information that we have been subsidized comes to us this happy
holiday time as the best news we have heard for a long time, and, be it re
marked parenthetically, the first and only intimation the Blade has had of
this pleasing intelligence comes in the Examiner's statement as above quoted.
Now is the winter of our discontent made indeed glorious summer by the cheer
ine news conveyed by our San Francisco contemporary. Never again shall the
Blade have occasion to chase around alter the sby advertiser; never again
shall we have to plead with th man who owes a bill for job printing. We are
on the payroll! At last it is ours to say:
Tnis Is the way we long have sought.
And ii.'i.irur 1 because we found it not.
And yet, while we rejoice at our own good fortune, we must not forget that
others have not so much cause for rejoicing. Some there be who are yet be
yond the pale. Some there undoubtedly are who know not the joy which is
ours. But they have their consolation, nor are they as those who ar^ without
hope. They may yet gain admission to the charmed circle, and hope, the guid
ins star of life, is yet theirs. So, therefore, while our heart goes out in sym
pathy to those of our journalistic brethren who have not yet entered into the
promised land of rai'way subsidy, our greatest commiseration is not given to
them. It is undoubtedly due to the San Francisco Examiner, for whom the
payroll is nothing but a bitter memory of what once was but never again can
be. Trials and tribula:ions are wbat we may all expect as we journey through
this life, but what sorrow equals that of being ruthlessly and relentlessly cut
off from the payroll in the prime of one's youth, so to speak? Heiter, far
better, never to have been on. Yet this has been the sad experience of tho San
Francisco Examiner, and our own rejoicing is sa.idened by the thought.
FROM A DEPRAVED STANDPOINT.
Bakersfietd Callfornlan.
The Examiner judges all other papers by itself, .which is perhaps a right
eous judgment from its own depraved standpoint. As it sold its own columns
for $1000 a month (and the Lord only knows bow many times it has sold them
to other people for smaller amounts, instance Blinker Murphy's sale of free
puffs for big dinners) it thinks that every paper in the State must be in the
same business. , ,
WILL BE A BLESSING TO THE PEOPLE,
A heap of trouble is brewing over the outcome of theFitzsimmons-Sharkey
fight. The San Francisco Examiner seems to be badly mixed up in the mud
dle, for which The Call is gettinp in its worfc on the "Monarch of the Dailies"
in great shape. It will be a blessing to the people of the Pacific Coast if the
Examiner is called down from its notorious perch of journalistic indecency.

CURIOUS PUNISHMENTS OF BYGONE. I
DAYSâ By Alice Morse Earle. Chicago: Herbert
S. Stone <Â£ Co. For sale In this city by William
Doxey, Palace Hotel. Price SI 60.
The scope of this book is indicated by Its
title. It describes the ways and means adopted
by our great-grandfathers for the punisnment
of offenses against the law, at the same time
making the recipient of such correction an
example that others might "fear and be
ashamed of breakinge out in like wicked
nesse."
In these pages we find described such gentle
correctives as the ducking-stool, the pillory,
the whipping-post, and brands and gags. The
first of these, it appears, was applied to those
good old colonial dames who possessed the
character of scolds. A graphic description of
a ducking In Virginia is given by one Thomas
Hartley. It is supposed to have been written
" to Governor Endicott of ' Massachusetts in
'1034. We quote:
"The day afore yesterday at two of ye clock
. in ye afternoon I saw this punishment given
to one Betsey, wife of John Tucker, who by ye
violence of her touguehas made his house and
ye neighborhood uncomfortable, She was
taken to ye pond near where I am sojourning
â¢ by v ; officer, who was joined by ye Magistrate
and ye Minister, Mr. Cotton, who had fre
quently admonished her, and a large number
of people. They had a machine for ye pur
pose; yt belongs to ye Parish, and which I
was so told had been so used three times this
â¢ ' Summer. It is a platform with 4 small roll
ers or wheels and two upright posts between
which works a Lever by a Rope fastened to
its shorter or heavier end. At ye end of ye
longer arm is fixed a stool upon which sd
Betsey was fastened by cords, her gown tied
fast around her feete. The Machine was then
moved up to ye edge of ye pond and ye Rope
was slackened by ye officer and ye woman was
allowed to go down under ye water for ye
space of half a minute. Betsey had a stout
stomach and would not yield until she had
allowed herself to be ducked 5 several times.
At length she cried piteously, '-Let me go 1 let
me go! By God's help I'll slu no more!" Then
they drew back ye Machine, untied ye Ropes
and let her walk home in her wetted clothes
a hoDef ully penitent woman."
The luckless author who chanced to offend
the powers that were fared vo better in his way
than did the unfortunate Betsey of the history
before quoted. Since the days of Greece and
Rome the woes of the writer have been many.
We learn that in the days of Augustus no less
than 20,000 volumes were seized and con
sumed. Later, by order of Diocletian, the
Bible fed the flames, and in England numer
ous works were publicly burned by the com
mon hangman. Milton's books were among
those condemned. We read that "Dr. Leigh
ton, who wrote 'Ziou's Plea Against Prelacy,'
paid dearly for calling the Queen a 'Daughter
of Heth' and Epitcopacy 'Satanical.' He was
degraded from the ministry, pilloried,
branded, whipped; his err was cut off, his
nostril slit; he was fined Â£ 10,000 and lan
guished eleven years in prison, only to be told
on his tardy release, with the irony ot fate,
that his mutilation and imprisonment had
been illegal." Such facto rather tend to lessen
our admiral Jon for the good old way of doing
things. It is, however, pleasing to note that
occasionally a pilloried publisher received
some solace from the crowd. One Williams,
who was set in the pillory in 1765 for repub
lishing the "North Briton," was treated with
marks of consideration and kindness. -'He
held a sprig of laurel in his hand as he stood !
and a purse of 200 guineas for his benefit was
collected in the crowd."
Here is another ludicrous instance which we
take from the chapter on "Punishments of
Authors and Books": "We learn from the
Connecticut Gazette that an offending publi
cation was sentenced tobepubllckly whipt, ac
cording to Moses 1 Law, with forty stripes save
one. and then burned." What possible end
the whipping of a book may have served his
tory saith not. Emanuel Elzas.
OUR COLON. AL HISIORY.
THE BEGINNERS OF A NATION*â By Edward
Egglesiou. D. Appleton & Co., New York
Price $1 50. For sale by William Doxey,
Palace Hotel, City.
In this painstaking work Edward Eggleston
has given us invaluable aid to the compre
hensive knowledge of the early days of our
country. No historical library will now be
complete without it. . Although it is the first
ot a succession of works on the history of this
country it represents sixteen years of research
Joy a most capable student. He accounts, how- j
ever, this to be by far the most difficult part
of his task. This book differs from the colonial
histories which we already have in being not
so much a /narration of all the events of the
early days, as a comprehensive survey of
the meaning of the main events and a tracing
of the far-reaching consequences of them.
The succ ssion of cause and effect is the main
topic. The author tells of these beginners of
English life in America who stand out in
special prominence as potent molders of the
future destinies of a great new empire. He
points out what visions beckoned to these
leaders which urged them to undertake the
founding of new States, and tells the story of
their hopes and disappointments and achieve
ments. -?3SS^8
The book is admirable in its condensation.
wh<ch Is such a desideratum in this busy age,
when there is so much to learn of the wonder
ful present, that we want the history of the
past given to us with a pithy brevity that tells
of events and at the same time draws the at
tention to their bearing upon the age in which
we must act by the light of such information
as we can read as wo run. Into 350 pages is
here crowded the research of sixteen years.
On every page are wide margins, made beauti
ful es well as useful. The notes tell the contents
of each paragraph, and so make the volume
convenient lor ready reference. The index is
copious and clear, and the book is got up in
a style both useful to the student and artisti
cally attractive. ThÂ« captions of the divisions
of the volume into books and chapters are un
usually good in their summary of the con
tents and the notes at the end of each chapter,
felicitously called "Elucidations," are very in
teresting. One of the finest chapters in the
book is "The Prophet of Religious Freedom,"
in which the author pays a glowing tribute to
Roger Williams, whose spiritual exaltation
gave him thoughts so far in advance of his
fellow men. The historian says: "He was but
abaobler to bis own time, but the prophetic
voice rings clear and lar, and ever clearer as
the ages go on." '

the stage preparation of ''The Little Minister,"
and it is not at all likely that he will make
any public appearance.
Asked as to bis own characters and which
he liked best, Dr. Watson replied: "Well, I
love them all, you know, for they are my own
children. They are my very dear friends,
every one of them. They know me best and I
know them best. Tney talk to me, they walk
with me, they argue with me and advise me,
I and persuade me to do this or that, beating
down incontinently many suggestions I make
to them. I love them and laugh and cry with
them, and they help aud assist me in my
work and make my life happy and bright
many times. I love them all. The public
has expressed a decided preference for one of
them, however. Yes, it is Dr. Mac Lure. I
love him very much. But if I were to say I
liked one the better I would name Jamie
Soutar. He is the best Scotch character I have
drawn, the most truthfully Scotch in all his
characteristics. Outwardly he is a cynic, but
at heart the very essence of kindness, and I
really love him.
"Yes, the names I use are all Scotch names
and are used by many writers, Mr. Barrie
among them. You understand that Drum
sheugh is the name of the farm, and all the
generations that live on it go by that name.
Marget Hoo is a character that is very dear to
me, and I am glad to know that so many peo
ple love her. Yes, it does my heart good to
know that people read my books and enjoy
them. lam exceedingly happy if I have made
any one the happier for my stories.
"I have no present literary plans. My new
book, 'Kate Carnegie,' is out and for a time I
will do no literary work. I have more Drum
tochty sketches to publish, howevei. I have
never offered anything for publication. All
the stories I have written have been written
to order, so to speak. I was requested to write
something for this paper or that, and I wrote
them.
"We are well acquainted with your literary
' men on the other side. I have read your
| older writers and learned of them. Emerson
I and Loweil have been teachers and prophets

' Whittier, too. And your Walt Whitman, who,
j I understand, is not so popular here, is a great
j favorite with us. Naturally we have a great
preference for your locality writers, they
; being of our own school. We know well and
love much the stories of Miss \Vilkiu3, James
| Lane Allen, George W. Cable, Thomas Nelson
â  l'age, Joel Chandler Harris and perhaps above
all Bret Hane. They are after our own lashion
more than your other writers, as Howells,
James, Aldrich and others. I am profoundly
impressed with Harold Frederic's 'Damnation

Lovers of descriptive writing will find In

I calls it a miniature journal of whim and sen
timent. The whim and sentiment is mingled
with word sketches of scenes in many lands.
They are all very short, and pass before the
mind's eye as a panorama. The author does
not let us linger long even before his pictures
of the most tamous places. Even Paris takes
j up but a paragraph, and Lausanne is painted
in a page. It is not all landscape work. He
is fond of describing picturesque people, and
I when he conjures up before the fancy romantic
j scenes of city or lake or mountain he tells of
I the moods the sight of them put the beholder
in. If there is any fault it is in over-gorgeous
ness of words and that the writer is a little bit
too much in love with alliteration.
Here Is the Naples of this word artist:
"Heaped beneath us all Naples, white and mo
tionless in the silent blaze of the midday sun;
circling the bay, still and smooth and blue as
the sky above, a misty line of white villages;
' dark, velvety shadows draping the hills; on
I the horizon, rising abruptly, Capri's notched
: silhouette."

In these half dozen sermons which were de

given to a larger public, the many working

lectured by those who worn go to church and
give the preachers a chance to do the lecturing.
His refutations of some of the accusations,
and acknowledgment of others, are so fair
and just that critics of the church should
be fair and just enough to read them.
â¢ The fact was brought out by his itiveetiga
tion that from two-thirds to three-quarters of
the laboring classes habitually stay away from

EIGHT CLEVER STORIES.
SOME WOMEN'S WAYSâ By MÂ»ry Angela
Dickens. K. F. Fenne & Co., New York. Trice
The ways of women are many and mysteri
ous, and in the short clever taies here told
some of these ways are explained to have a
nobleness far beyond the comprehension of
the ordinary observers by whom their lives
were surrounded. In the story called "An
j Unprincipled Woman" the heroine displays
| an amount of principle which takes the reader
by surprise, and by the exercise of a higner
intelligence and deeper sympathy than would
have been expected of her she saves & man
whom most others would in their righteous
ness have crushed. In another good one, "So
as by Fire," we have an illustration of the
benefits that may be made to grow from re
gretted evil in the history of a pastor to whom
the passage through a dark valley was an en
trance to a new life, "a life of such wide sym
pathy and comprehension as he had never
dreamed of."

LITERARY NOTES.
A new book by the late Miss Mamie Dickens,
"My Father as I Recall Him," is announced
for early publication.
The December number of the North Ameri
can Review contains an article on "American
Bicycles in England,' by George F. Parker,
United States Consul at Birmingham.
Sir Walter Besant has just brought out a
j book of drawing-room plays, written in col
laboration with W. H. Pollock and depending
for interest on plot rather than epigram.
Book News for December will contain the
first article In literary criticism contributed to
any magazine by lan MacLaren and the only
article written by him during his American
tour.
The Review of Reviews for December de
nounces the aaministration's abandonment
of American interests in Turkey, and demands
that existing treaty rights be respected and
enforced.
George W. Cable, the editor of The Sympo
sium, writes appreciatively and gracefully of
J. M. Barrie, the famous author of "Senti
mental Tommy," in the Christmas number of
his magtizine. The paper is enriched by a
beautiful photograph of Mrs. J. M. Barrie, and
a striking portrait of Mr. Barrie forms the
frontispiece.
The frontispiece of the December Century,

HFS* HE death in England, a fortnight ago, of Coventry Patmore, removes a figure among English poets, but one whose distinction, such
yiS, as it was, passed out more than twenty years ago. His first appearance in print was greeted with howls of derision from the critics,
i\ who again and again endeavored to kill him off; but despite their efforts Patmore continued to live and write, and was exceedingly
"-- *" pleasing to a whole generation of admirers. Numerous editions of his works have been published both in England and on this
continent, and the demand for them has proved tne difliculty of killing a poet. In his writings Patmore has by some been compared to
Wordsworth, but we prefer to regard him as well in the van of those minor poets whom we need not read to criticize.

In answer to the question so often asked,
"What is the good of polar exploration?' the
Lounger in the Critic says: "If some of the
more recent explorers were asked, I think
that they would reply that the pole Is almost
as much of a cold mine as South Africa. Dr.

London Chronicle. They are to publish a
complete set of his works at a guineaâtwenty

The Macmillan Company announces a vol
ume of travel which for many reasons will
attract and hold attention. It is, "The Log of
a Naturalist in West Africa," by Miss Mary
Kingsley, daughter of the novelist and enthu
siastic naturalist, the Rev. Charles Kingsley.
It appears that Miss Kingsley's primary object
in making the trip was to acquire beetles,
fetishes and, if possible, a collection of fishes
from rivers north ot the Congo, but her atten
tion was by no means confined to these curios
and her book contains new material of value
to the ethnologist and student of folklore as
well as to naturalists.
The yearly volume of St. Nicholas just pub
lished is as full of good things for the young
folks to digest as the proverbial egg is full of
meat. An idea of its size may be gathered
from the fact that it contains more than one
thousand pages and over seven hundred pic
tures. There are stories about animals, fairy
tales, tales of adventure, stories for young
Americans, a number of entertaining special
papers and a vast quality of entirely new out
side matter. Suitable articles for the perusal
of the very little ones are added, and on the

I want no fortune, large or small;
I want no gems or jewels rare;
Great riches on my soul would pall
And till my heart with carking care.
I have no wish for mansion* great,
O'erspreed with pomp and full of gaud.
Let others seek a large estate;
'1 is not the portion: I would laud.
I have no love for acreage ;
I have no praise at all for gold;
I would not place one pin in pledge
To win a mass of wealth untold.
'Twould never set my heart aglow
To cry, "Behold! mv millions, these!"
'Twould rather fill that heart with woe
Aud utterly destroy my ease.
'Tis better far that all these things
To others should belongâ to those
Who, bankers, nobles, merchants, king*,
Enjoy in splendor to repose.
Or, better still, to such a one
As she, the greatest joy in life,
Through whom my present ease is won,
My weli-loved â¢'millionairess" wife!
I am content without one mill,
And sball be so in sickness, health,
Let come what may of good or ill
As long as she retains her wealth.

The Quiet fort.
There lies a quiet part across the sea,
Where the j>roud sail is furled,
Where the bright banner flares and flaunts no
more
That once waved round the world.
There the brave ships that steered for other
shores,
That fought the bitter blast,
And dared the unknown straits, the frost
hung bay?,
Find harborage at last.
And those white barks that sought the isles of
dream,
The lands of love's report,
They too, though steering gladly otherwhere,
Have found the quiet port.
There the dark night comes down around
them, there
The weary captains rest,
The homesick voyager bows down his head,
The sage forgets his quest.
But yet, ah, even while we fall on sleep,
We are content to wait;
Comrades, the land of cur desire is near,
This port Is but its gate.

AN ITINERANT HOUSE AND OTHER
STORIEDâ By Emma Praueen Dawson. Wil
liam Doxev, San * rauclsco. Price $1 50. For
Bale by all bookstores.
In this book are collected the best stories of
a California author whom Current Literature
pronounces as standing in the front rank of
the literary development of California. Some
f these have appeared before in magazines,
but a number of them are here published for
the first timo. Words of high praise huve
been bestowed upon the previous work of this
writer by men perfectly competent to pass
literary judgment. M. B. Anderson, professor
of English literature to Stanford University,
says: "In order to find Miss Dawson's equal in
her own special field the critic must go back
to Poe or to Hawthorne." The stories are full
of mystery and dream. Several of them have
been prize - winners. The one called "The
Night Before the Wedding" bore off a premium
for being superlatively queer. Miss Dawson
puts into the mouth of one of her characters
the exclamation, "Happy are you poets and
musicians, who can express what is vague."
If the possession of this power brings happi
ness then is Miss Dawson to be envied both for
her happiness and her talents. She seems to
have a deal of what in her poem "Unfulfilled"
is called the "force celestial that could snare
the secret thought of man."
The story which gives its name to the book,
"An Itinerant House," is a weird tale of this
City, well fitted to keep one "awake o' nights,"
both by the thrill of the interest and the hor
rible ghostliness of it. That old house had its
wails impregnated with some mystic force
which produced ghostly suggestions to the
minds of those who stayed within them in the
early days when it stood on Telegraph Hill.
Since then the wandering house has been
moved about from street to street, still keep
ing its power of giving horrible sensations to
those who lodge therein. All the inhabitants
of this big City who dwell in old houses of
wh,ich they do not know the complete his
tory can after reading this tale go to bed with
the uncanny sensation that before morning
some fearful fancy may be forced upon their
imagination by these haunted walls.

pany, San Francisco, Cal. For sale by William
Doxey and the City bookstores; price $1.
The author of this little collection of short
poems has lived in California most of her life,
and therefore they should have attention as a
home production. Some of them have been
published before as "The Later Poems," but
this Is the first edition of the "Latest Poems"
Among the pleasing little pieces perhaps the
best is "As a Nun Would Tell Her Beads,"
which is after the manner of Browning.
Another brief aud pretty one is that com

is mine."

THE YELLOW BOOK (Volume XI, October,
1898). John Lane: The isodiev Head, London
and New York. Price $1 50. For sale by
William Doxey, Palace Hotel, tity.
Few people fancy the fantastic cover of this
quarterly unless they have a taste for Itte gro
tesque and yellow as great as the heathen Chi
nese. But if they will overcome all natural
repugnance they may have for Beardsleyism,
bravely lift the yellow lid and begin to read
the first story Ã¼bout Lord George Hell, who is
wicked as his name, they will at onco become
so interested as to forget their prejudices
against nightmare-suggested pictures and the
bilious color which is a badge of honor In the
Celestial Kingdom. Lord George Hell, whose
history is called "The Happy Hypocrite,''
wooes the woman he loves under cover of a
mask, and, when he wins and marries her,
changes his name from Hell to Heaven, saying
to himself at the time, to appease his con
science for the falsehood, that "Lord George
Hell is dead." The true happiness of the
hypocrite comes in at the end, when the mask
being violently torn from George's fare he
begs his beloved wife not to look at his wicked
features, but she protests that the real face
was fairer than the semblance with which he
had deceived her. He looks into her eyes and
sees there the reflection of his own face. It
was indeed true: Lord George Hell was
dead. The story is a masterpiece of sym
bolic beauty.
There are a number of other good stories in
the 340 pages, aud in addition to the pictures
of curious grotesquenesÃ there are some pretty
ones, and especially fine are the ''War Horsea
of Rustem." Among the many literary at
tractions the best is "A Ballad and a TalÂ°,"
called "The Heavenly Lover," by B. Paul N\ i
man. This is a beautiful poem which will
help the book to a warm welcome 11 the p.r

credit for their enterprise.

study of the effects of civilization upon archi

almost all the architectural monuments spe

knowledge. American architecture, too, re

ployed in enforcing the acts of treaty have
power to invoke generally the assistance of
the executive officers of the colony?" That of
course was a foretaste of the events which led
to America becoming a nation. The point of
this memoir of the sister of Otisâ the writer
being Mrs. Alice Brownâ is the light it throwt
upon his time.
Arthur Waugh in his London letter to the
Critic says: "Mr. ZangwlU is understood to be
about to desert fiction lor a season and to pro
ject a series of studies of a certain class of
Jewish development. These are to be called
"Dreamers of the Ghetto," and the types
chosen will be conspicuous for the ideality
tind humanity of their creed. The Christ will
be among them, but the latest will be of quite
recent origin. Mr. ZangwiU is already ad
vanced upon his work, which he hopes tohava
finisned before next summer. It is not at all
improbable that he will be more successful in
this line of literature than he has proved as a
story-teller. His method has grown in com
plexity and is now less suited than
at first to the medium of popular fiction. Ha
is wise ii he appreciates this betimes, for he is
a man who is Dound to do something big,
when once he Has found his proper sphere.

* I 'HE horse show is a thing of the past,
I but during the coming week wo will
continue to hear many remarks on
the beautiful gowns and the fair women
who adorned the boxes and the choicest
seats. Perhaps from a social and dressy
point of view the display was not quite as
fine as that of last year. However, all
said it was most satisfactory, but New
York certainly sets the fashions in many
things, and those who lead society here
are affected by the attitude assumed by
Eastern autocrats, and apropos of tnelast
New York show Vogue says:
"Fashionable patronage the world over
has been proverbial for its fickleness.
Perhaps in our republican society, where
there is less of the sentiment of noblesse
oblige, it has less stability, less staying
powers. At all events our social functions
â those particularly of a public character â
are not dependable. For one or two or
three years they may meet with greatest
favor â become, in fact, unprecedented in
brilliancy and success, supported by le
beau monde with the enthusiasm of its
fashion and wealthâ when, presto! the
whim has passed, the fad in over, and the
result is an entire change of base or sudden
inenity followed by extinction.
"The borse show is a case in point. It
begins to show symptoms of having lost
the elans of the first two displays, and
there are indications that the smart set no
longer respond con arnore. So it goes.
There is little hope for permanency oi rep
resentation to be counted upon in our
amusements. Everything is ior the day,
for the craze of the nour, and liKe a child's
toy to be cast aside."
All lovers of horses will sincerely reeret
fashion's decree if within the next year or
two such exhibitions are abolished, still,
doubtless some equally interesting di
version will be substituted, and we will
aJI wondpr how we ever could have been
so enthusiastic over such a display.
Oup Pretty Women's Gowns
But to return to the subject of our pretty j
women and their gowns. They were as- j
euredly most lovely and transformed the
Pavilion into a rcse garden, and, indeed,
the blossoms were of such uniform perfec
tion that it was difficult to decide which
was most beautiful. Ourdressmakers and i
awfcy Eastern and foreign ones must have j
racked their brains ivad exercised the j
greatest ingenuity to have evolved such
unique and chic confections and creations.
Such combinations of iaces, furs, chiffons,
mousselines de soie, crepe lisse silks,
satins, brocades and jewels are sel
dom seen. Several of the brides
present were most picturesque in
truly delightful frocKs, the acknowl
edged belles were bravely attired, and the
dear, sweet debutantes were simply charm
ing in dainty, delicious gowns that weil j
suited their fresh, bright faces, and our j
Istately matrons were gorgeously attired
in their silks and satins, their velvets and
jewels.
I The bonnets and hats worn had in most
cases been selected with rare good taste
and gave the necessary artistic touch to
many a toilet. Indeed, 1 agreed with the
remark of a bright Eastern woman who
said: "Well, you certainly have some mil
liners here who would make a name for
themselves even En New York," and this
reminds me that you will all probably like
to hear about the Tzarine hat, which has
met with well-deserved popularity in New
York. A correspondent says: Extremely
coquettish is the Tzarine hat, with the
black velvet brim rolled up the sides and
lined with green velvet. High but rather
large crown in paler green velvet, with a
lace sc3rf caught in front by a large jet
buckle. Quite at the back, on the left side,
was posed a blackbird, above which curved
an osprey plume. To complete the toilet
was a love of a manchon â a large one, as
they all are nowâ with deep frills of black
velvet, pl'sscs of white satin and green
lisse, great chic bows of broad ribbon of
ustrous satin, exquisitely tied.
Two Jldmipable Frocks.
Two frocks worn by sisters lately at a
very fashionable tea (they assisted in re- j
ceiving) are worthy to be described. The
elder appeared in a skirt of light blue '
taffeta, which had a silvery sheen over it,
and wa3 trimmed high above the hem so
as to give the effect of a double skirt, two
bands of l3ce encircled it and they were
united down the middle by a narrow band
of sable. The bodice was likewise of
taffeta covered with creamy Brussels lace,
over which, were plentifully sprinkled
rhinestones, which shimmered in the
light. The debutante who wore this
dainty costume is quite narrow across the
shoulders, so the necessary width was
given by a judicious management of fine
lace and fur. Her collar and waistband
were of a deliciom green. The sleeves
were long and ruched, the net only being
used in their composition, a frill of lace
fell over the hands.
The younger sister wore a pink glace
taffeta ; the lour and a half yard skirt was
bordered with three full ruches of the i
same; the pink bodice had pink chiffon '
most gracefully draped over it, and over I
that fitted exquisitely a bolero of white
Irish iace, embroidered with pink coral
beads. The long and fantastically lovely
sleeves of chiffon had a bouillon ne of
chiffon over the shoulders, surrounded by
a lace epaulet and four bands of lace-edged
insertion apparently bold the bolero to
gether. They each terminate with a hand
some coral button gold mounted. Coral
is for the moment enjoying the greatest
favor and is being most extensively used.
"Emeralds are of all the colored jewels
the most fashionable, both under their
real aspect and their imitation. Most at
tractive muff chains are formed of cabo
chon emeralds, red enamel and pearls, al
ways excepting those made entirely of
diamonds, which are completed with dia
mond tassels of jewels flexibly set.
And, by the way, it may be observed at
the theaters that the wearing oi these long
FASHION'S
chains has at la^t reached London. No
well-dressed woman appears now in the
evening without a chain of pearls and a
chain of some jewels or enamels. As I
have previously observed, the fashion is
absurd, but it is none the less charming,
and we are slowly but surely yielding to
it. Jewels are altogether in high favor.
"Women deserving of the title 'well-
ressed' all decorate their hair with dia- |
monds, and it is no rare sicht to meet real <
diamond buttons on evening frocks, while \
the decolletage is liberally besprinkled i
with diamond brooches. And then, ns I
' said before, ihese pendant chains offer ex
cellent opportunities for the- display of our
taste and our wealth. The bracelets of
the chain order, set with many colored
gems, continue on their career of popu
larity; but 1 question whether it is good
form to wear during the daytime half a
dozen of these on either arm, each dis
playing jewels of the richest and the
rareÂ«t. However, such is the ordinary
conduct oi the fashionable woman."
Tfye Latest Parisian .Models.
One Parisian model is made of the new
eregue cloth â a perfectly loveJy shade of
violet that is being much worn at this
moment in Paris. The skirt is absolutely
plain, mounted with a couple of narrow
box pleats just at the center of the waist.
The bodice is of Jeanne d'Arc velvet, a
lovely fabric with a silver sheen, the
Dolero being of cloth, trimmed with
quaintly exquisite Japanese buttons.
Quite an idea, which we can easily imitate
in San Francisco.
Equally lovely is a dress of dark green
cashmere cloth, made with a trimming of
Greek bands in the same cloth stitched
upon the skirt. Tha bodice is composed
of a chinchilla blouse, with a little basque
band of green velvet and a Jeanne d'Arc
bolero. This costume is given a certain
art by the addition of a large chinchilla
muff with a ruc::e of velvet and lace on
either side. Very chic is the tout en
semble!
Most attractive is a toilet of accordion
plaited gray cloth and gray baby Jamb.
Worth has just completed such a gown,
j the sleeves being trimmed with a double
line of fine black silk braid at intervals
from the wrist to the shoulder. The gar
ment is, taken all in all, rather eccentric,
but then the demand is for novelty, as it
) is, as that alone marks the artistic clever
dressmaker. There are many little points
known by fair Parisiennes that are worthy
of our obseivation, and one is this: A
Farisienne considers that only a plain
material makes a becoming skirt, and in
fact can mold her hips and give her "la j
! ligne," and she remains true to her
opinion.
This npplies c hiefly to woolen dresses;
dressy silks she wilt admit with flowers
and iines, however. Silk is quite a differ
ent matter. Apropos of cloth gowns,
excellent is one of chestnut-brown cloth,
of which the bodice forms a sort of bib
over an under-bodice of green satin, pat
terned by velvet foliage in many tones of
browns with here and there a touch of tor
qnoise-blue, while the braiding on the
cioth adds another note of color. A green
gown, tailor-made in cloth, recently cre
ated in the same gay capital, has a bodice
the insertions of which are of velvet of a
i darker shade. Long narrow bands of vel
| vet ornament the bodice and the top of
| the skirt in rowa of three, each being fin
ished by a green jade button. The corse
let belt is of black satin terminating in a
rosette at the side.
Another charming walkingcostume has
been seen in a fine cioth of a nut-brown
shade. The bodice ia made in the Rus
sian blouse mode and has its revers
edged with sable, opening over a chemi
sette of golden brown velvet, a roll of
sable giving a pretty finish to the collar.
The swathed waistband of black satin
ends at the back in long sash-like loops,
almost reaching to the bottom of the
skirt.
Collars and Capes.
Numerous collars and capes are made in
astrakan or sealskin, bordered with a
wide band of another fur, such as sable,
chinchilla or silver, blue or blacK fox.
Quite fantastic are some made of marten
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1896.
fur, leaving a vandyked or scalloped bor
der, from which falls a wide ruche of lace.
The same lace borders the High collar and
falls in front on a silk waistcoat, over
which lies the fur of the cape. Sealskin
en ters into the composition of a most-suc
cessful cape, made very full with godet?.
It crosses in the front and is fastened on
the shoulder with a fringe of marten tails,
gathered together in a bunch. All round
tbo cape is a five-inch band of marten.
The collar is funnel shaped and of the
same fur. A flat muff of marten,
with the little animal's head and
tail and a full frill of lace at each
end accompanies this delightful wrap.
But enough of cloth gowns and furs.
More elaborate conceptions for weddings
and cotilions, etc., demand our serious
and concentrated thought as the season
waxes gayer every wee!:; so a new sleeve,
a trifling difference ia combination of col
ors, the merest suggestions are all being
received thankfully by those to whom
fashion has imparted her mysteries.
Every style, modernized of course, is to be
seen. For example, Louis XII, Louis XV,
Empire, 1840, according: to the time and
circumstances, but such modes to be sue â¢
cessful must be carried out most carefully
and never is it allowed to mix styles in the
same costume.
But first let me call your attention to
the most attractive models here illustrated
by our artist and thus descri bed :
"Round skirt and cioss-litting sleeves in
frarnet-colored cioth, ornamented with
Swiss belt, festoons and throat lapeb in
fancy jet galon; ple.itiiixs of black satin.
Blouse striped with black velvet; neckband
to correspond. Shoulder cape, lined with
garnet silk, in sable or otter fur, like the
flounce round the skirt. Large fur muff
barred with chinchilla bands, on each of
which sparkles a jeweled clasp securing a
tab of pleated lace artistically turned in
different directions. Hat in garnet felt,
j edged with fur."
Also very interesting is the delightful
bolero for evening wear, with its Empire
belt. The materials employed are rose
pink satin and white tulle.
At an unusually brilliant cotillon very
lately was worn a gorgeous dress of white
damas. The flowers of the pattern were
embroidered witb chenille and seed pearls;
the skirt was perfectly plain, with a demi
train; the low bodice, slightly pointed,
was fastened with diamond buttons, and
round the throat a band of sable and tufts
of roses. The short sleeves were of gauze
and damas, the long gloves being held
with an elastic jeweled bracelet at the top
of the arm; mauvre-silk stockings and
shoes of the same material as the dress,
white marabout fan.
The hostess was appareled in a pale
gftld moire antique, the water marks
slightly outlined with gold; plain skirt;
round the square cut bodice was a band
of chinchilla, and here and there a tuft of
shaded pansies; lace ruffles edged the el
bow sleeves, which were draped en pa
pillon, with a strap of chinchilla. A,
lovely Baronne was a picture in a plain
silk, cale au lait in color, covered with
shaded roses, most artistically painted by
the wearer; white cauze and roses with
out leaves beautified the bodice; pale
pink stockings and white satin shoes,
painted with small roses.
Dainly and smart was a white Pekin
through which ran pin ic stripes with gar
lands of roses and lilies of the valley on
the stripes round the skirt, with a row of
small roses close together round the edge,
which were veiled with a white lace
flounce. The bodice was low and pointed
and had a fulling of lace in front and also
at the back, but still showing the outlines
of the waist distinctly.
Cl2it-Cnat.
The fashion of wearing a watch list
ened to the bodice has been obsolete for
quite a time in this country, but some
women still so adorn themselves in Lon
don. This style rinds no favor in the
eyes of most men; so.it is reported that
not long ago a man walked down Regent
street with a small American clock fast
ened to the lapel of his coat, hoping that
the ridicule it would excite might make
women stop offering such temptations to
every passing thief. This person created
so great a sensation and so much amuse
ment that the police remonstrated with
him, but he declared he saw no reason
why he should not wear a clock just as
ladies wear their watches.
Members of the very interesting and
extensive Needlework Guild iv this City
will be interested in learning that the
Duchess of York has this year collected
for a similar guild in London 4000 articles
of clothing. H. R. H. has been pret?liy
and aptly named the 'Princess of the
Poor." She will never have a prouder
title. Mabcella.
Fop .Men.
The waistcoat illustrated is of a richly
brocaded black silk and from London
comes the information that such waist
coats are being worn with evening dress,
and in the spring it is predicted that they
will be worn wi'h frock coats. White and
gray waistcoats are also made; the design
in some cases is outlined in gray or gold
or brightened with some slight touches of
color.
The waistcoats are made single or
double breasted, with silk buttons to
match; or, if the wearer possess any
antique gold or other waistcoat buttons,
this is an excellent opportunity for their
introduction. At present the fashion al
most entirely confines itself to dress waist
coats, but we are informed that next year
the plain black brocades will be much
worn in the daytime. This return to the
modes cf onr great-grandfathers will be
gladly welcomed as a relief to the mo
notony of male attire in the evonine.
The attempt to revive this fashion is, of
course, due to the fact that the Prince of
Wales gave such extensive orders for bro
cades suitable for waistcoats to the Spital
lields v/eavcrs. The two young English
men who have been wearing Kay waist
coats recently may yet find themselves in j
the height ot fashion. Who can tell?
Him would frown upon the mere sugges
! tion of a crimson waistcoat to-day, but
as spring draws near his views are
quite likely to undergo a decided change.
i Our artistic senses are to be further grati
fied shortly I hear by the appearance by
one of the Britishers I have just men
! ticned arrayed in a light brown leathern
I waistcoat.
At the present moment the best dressed
I of men in America are strictly conserva
tive in their views, and show no defire to
depart from the conventional styles. Him
admits that: "There is yot a lingering de
sire for brighter plaid waistcoats than are
j exactly the best in point of taste; and the
most brilliant of cinnamon-pink shirts
is even seen at as conspicuous a place as
the Waldorf, worn by a man of reputed
fashion and in the evening."
By the way, how few properly fitted
j frock coats, comparatively speaking, aro
I ever seen. They are difficult to cut well,
I and even some of the bsst tailors here do
not make them correctly, and a second-
I rate man simply makes a perfect botch of
I such a garment.
The very newest gloves are of a queer
shade of green, described as 3 soacies of
cafe au lait. They are extremely smart

FROM GREATER NEW YORK
A Budget of Interesting J^eWs ar\d Qossip
/ibout the California Colony in the
Eastern Metropolis
NEW YORK, N. X V., Dec. 7.â Hooray!
Whizz! Bing! The boys have been hav
ing packs of fun pelting each other with
crisp white snowballs durinc the past
week! A flock of angels swooped down
near earth last Sunday night, because
when New York rubbed its sleepy eyes
Monday morning it found the world was
polar white with feathery snow.
The first snow of the season seems
whiter and cleaner and more welcomethan
any of the other winter storms; but that is
because it is a novelty, and humanity
craves constant change in all things. Per
haps that is why we grow old so rapidly.
To-day the sun is shining warm and
patches of snow still cling to the house
tops and lie on untrodden ground every
where. Now and then a stray snowball,
thrown by a stiaying schoolboy, splashes
the woolly surface of a passing overcoat,
but otherwise all is quiet on Manhattan
Isle.
The "first-snow" fever has abated and
we will settle down to the regular routine
business of an Eastern winter.
When Dr. H. C. Cluness and his estima
ble wife came to town they put up at the
Grand Hotel and intended to enjoy the
sights, the opera and their friends in an
independent Western style. They carried
out their plans for a few days only. At
the end of that period a couple of old and
time-honored friends claimed their pres
ence and the firm resolves dissolved into
the acceptance of their friends' genial
hospitality. They are visiting on Fifty
eighth street, but the doctor strolls into
the Grand every day to get his mail,
answer correspondence and chat with old
acquaintances.
Mrs. J. 08. Gunn and young daughter
left the Fifth-avenue Hotel for the West
on Tuesday. They will stop at Cleveland
and Chicago a few days each, arriving
home about the 16th of the month. Mrs.
Gunn will have a number of handsome
new kowiib to show her friends, for she
has been busy shopping during her stay
in town, and never have the shopping dis
tricts been so lively and so full of gor
geous finery.
W. G. Coggswell of Los Angeles is
at the Metropole. He has come on to
purchase some novelties in the way oi
furnishings for his little summer resort.
Walter W. Bacbman of San Francisco
arrived last Tuesday. He will make a
short stay.
J. E. Carey will rush through his busi
ness here in timo to spend Christmas in
dear old Californiaâ at least he said as
much to a friend yesterday.
Mrs. J. B. and Miss Emma Butler" of
San Francisco have left the Imperial and
are visiting in Plainville, N. J. They are
the guests of Mrs. Eustice, sister of Mrs.
Butler.
B. P. Meyer and F. P. Jacobs left for
California on Friday.
H. S. 81auqht, the president of the San
Francisco Ramie Company, is bu3ily en
gaged in organizing a New York com
pany. He declares that the wonderful
ramie plant will, inside of a few years,
completely revolutionize the cotton
market.
A magnificent raraie mill is now being
finished in Washington, D. (J., the ma
chinery is being placed and everything
will soon bo in readiness for active work.
Mr. SSaught is an enthusiastic and inde
fatigable worker and quickly surmounts
every obstacle.
E. W. Marks, who was visiting us for
many weeks, left for the Golden Gate the
hrst of the week.
Colonel F. M. Irons is tip at the Gre
noble.
L. C. Parker, the well-known mining
man of Butte, Mont., came into town
Saturday with colors flying. He is here
to place some valuable mining properties
located in Nevada and Montana. Mr.
Parker is well known in San Francisco.
He lived for many years in Virginia City,
and paid many visits to the Golden Gate
during that period.
R. Luscombe of San Francisco arrived
Saturday morning and hurried downtown
to meet old acquaintances and let them
know he had reached the city safe and
hapDy.
Mrs. William L. Price, who has been at
the Everett House for several months
past, left there a few days ago to visit
friends in New England. She may not
return to New YorK, but just continue her
journey homeward after the Christmas
holidays.
Hon". J. M. Brazee floated into the
crowded thoroughfares the other morn
ing, transacted a lot of business, and fold
ins his gripsack quietly stole away.
"These Californians know their busi
ness," said a man to me to-day. "They
just sniff at us Easterners these days, and
gleefully hustle homeward when the skies
are lead and the snow filters down. They
don't like the looks of icicles, I guess."
The man was right, perhaps, because
the arrivals of California folk are few and
very far between.
Tr-ere is a tinge of sadness lurking about
Thirtieth street and Broadway these days.
Dear old A. M. Palmer has quietly re
leased himself from the management of
what has been long known as Palmer's
Theater. Across the front now appeals
the older name of "Wallack's."
The swinging doors bear little gold let
ters spelling "Wallack's." Everything
which even hints at the palmy or stormy
Palmer days is being completely obliter
ated.
It is rumored that Mo??, the owner and
lessor of the theater, is a very rapacious
sort of a man, and that through his cruel,
hard-fisted methods the Wallacks came to
grief. Mr. Palmer has bravely buffeted
cruel waves of defeat, and triumphantly
sailed over smooth waters of success and
wealth.
He is a man beloved by thousands, and
though at present the world shrugs its
shoulders and wonders at his present atti
tude, it may depend that he will bob up
serenely, dignitiedly, victorious. Mr.
Palmer has what every public man should
haye â a brainy and courageous wife, de
voted and lovely.
1 had a very interesting chat with W.
H. Crane the other evening. He still
labors under the unhappy belief that
Californians do not like him and never
will. Everybody has heard that he once
chanced to remark something against
"Cftliiornia critics and California climate."
The outcome of it all was that Mr.
Crane, the able actor and genial gentle
man, has firmly and sweetly refused all
overtures from Western managers. For
eight glittering successful years W. H.
Crane has triumphantly marched through
the North, South, East and Middle West,
but never has he deigned to ascend the
mighty Rockies and even peep upon the
sunset States. He does not claim to be a
Hannibal, but some day he may be in
veigled into crossing the mountain-tops.
In the meantime Mr. Crane is growing
richer every day, the public is growing
fonder and Californians are losing a very
good thing.
To-day I saw McKea Rankin, the once
elegant and shapely, waddling across
Broadway puffing and blowing under a
mountain of flabby fat.
I gazed with wonder at his broad back
and casped with astonishment when I
beheld ttie protruding paunch of the once
manly Fwankin. His faco is smoothly
shaven, accentuating if possible his
puffed cheeks and double chin. Why, oh
why! How, oh how! do all the promi
nent actors and actresses develop into
male and female Falstaff3 before they are
50 years o!d.
Even the great and only Oscar Hammer
stein is tending that way, but then he is
just turned 50, as he frankly admits, so
one can pardon him the offense.
New York ought to ba proud of Oscar
Hamraerstein. Through his example
wealthy property-owners and prominent
theatrical managers have invested their
money in building theaters and t>laces of

Vhe Jamoua Sac Indian's Story Jrom Jfis
Own Kips
Some time during the early part of the
last century, probably, a wandering tribe
CÂ»f Indians, of whom history is silent, left
ttre black shores of the Upper St. Lawrence
for a more congenial climate.
The sources from which tlie first pnrt of
this stetch is taken are chiefly legendary
but, such as they are, it is given as it was
taken from the lip ; of one who is charac
terized by tiie editor of a small volume
Called "The Autobiography of Black
Hawk,'' as a warrior, a patriot and subse
quently a prisoner, Ma-ka-ta:-me-shc-kia
kiak, or Black HaWK. Toward (he latter
part of bis life, says the American Field,
â  tlifs"bero of many battles, when old, poor
W awl obscure, became desirous of giving bis
M story to his white friends, "that the
v-ebple of the United States might know
â the cause which impelled him to act as he
h'ad'done and the principles by which he
was governed." This was faithfully trans
.â¢" ;l*t*d : by Antoine Le Claire, s. half-breed of
â  French and Indian parentage, whose de
. . gcefidants live in Davenport, lowa.
It must be remembered that, although
'â 'Slack Hawk's story is intermingled with
â  legends, it is probably true as regards the
emigration of the tribes â the Sacs, as they
were called â from place to place to their
final destination, the Rock River country,
in Illinois. The tradition of the causes
which led to this great event in their
bjstory was handed down to Black
Hawk as coming from his great
grand fat' er, Nana-ma-kee, who, by
blackening his face, fasting and in
vocation to the Great Spirit, appeared to
the chief in dream?, telling him to fast
one year more, and then to take his
brother chieftains and travel to the leit of
the sun ri-ing till they could hear certain
sounds, when they would meet a white
man who would be a father to this people.
The sounds were heard end the witite man
appeared. He announced himself to be
the son of the King of France and said
that he also had fasted lour years; that
the Great Spirit had visited him in dreams,
tsl!ing him he would meet his children,
the Indians, and their chief.
They returned to their nation. The old
chief, when he learned of their meeting
the white man, presented the great
medicine-bag to his son, Nana-ma-kee,
baying it was the soul of their nation, that
it nfver had been disgraced and he hoped
i it never' would be. Nana-ma-kee was a
\ young man, and there were some dissen
sions among the people on account of so
much power being civen to one so young,
but when tht* "talk" was at its height a
violent thunderstorm appeared and the
lightning struck a tree, setting tire to it.
Young Nana-ma-kee seized a burning
branch, made a fire in the lodge, seated
the people around it, who were awed by
what seemed to be a miracle, and addressed
them:
"I am young, but the Great Spirit has
called me to take the rank I hold. While
my father, the chief, lived I had no wish
to take his place. You have seen the
power given by the Great Spirit in causing ]
that fire. I wish that the chiefs, my j
brothers, mamnever let it go out." '
All were satisfied when they heaid and j
saw that the Great Spirit had spoken and
confirmed his words by the burning tree.
In the legend of the burning tree one is
reminded of the burning bush out of |
which God spake to Moses regarding the I
children of Israel. In all accounts of the j
religion of the Indians I know of no |
record where they are represented as wot- j
ahiping the Great Spirit in any material j
form or wood or stone. The Great Spirit j
was immortal and invisible.
After a long absence the French father j
returned, and a trade was kept un for j
some time with the tribe, exchanging ;
various commodities for their furs and
other articles. The British, who were then
at war with the French, at last overpow
fceredthem and gained possession of Quebec.
A-ome of the different tribes joined In the
Var, and afterward united their forces
against the Sacs and drove them to Mon
treal and thence to Mackinaw. They met
the British Father, as Black Hawk calls
him, who helped them and furnished
them with goods. They were troubled
by -cfaeir enemies, wlio drove tliem from
I place to place, till they reached Green
! Bay, or what is now called Sauk River.
j There they held council with the tribe or
: nation of Foxes, who abandoned their vil
lages and joined the Sacs. A party of
j young men had been on an expedition
! southward as far as Rock River, and the
| young braves returned to Green Bay full
I of the f.reat news of the beautiful region
they had just left; and soon after the
tribes were en route for the promised land.
They were joined by the Foxes, and from
ihat time the history of the two tribes
seems to be closely entwined.
For more than a hundred years they
BLACK HAWK.
I held undisputed possession of the Mississ
j ippi Valley, from ibe Ouisconsin to the
Portage ties Sioux, near the mouth of the
Missouri, about 703 miles in length. At
that time tliey had little intercourse with
the whites, except with the traders who
came to their villages for their peltries.
At that time intoxicating iiquors were un
known among them, although afterward
introduced by the traders. Black Hawk
was bitterly opposed to this, and some
times, as said by aa eye-witness, "drove
in the kegs of whisky or mm. which were
furnished them by traders."
They held their lands by their prowess
a? warriors. In 1804 an event occurred
which gave rise to all their troubles with
the whites. One of their number had
killed an American, for which he was im
prisoned. Four or rive Indian? went down
to St. Louis, where he was confined, to
secure his release and his return to his
family by offering a compensation for the
1 ife of the murdered man, according to
the Indian custom. General William
Clarke, the companion of Lewis, nt that
time was the general superintendent of
Western Indians and their affairs.
The Government, through Clarke, re
fused the compensation, but demanded
lands. Black Hawk and the other In
| dians, who were informed of the circum
| stances, wero bitterly 'oppased to parting
with th"ir lands, as these men had no
authority for this, but went simply to res
cue the prisoner.
It is said that the men were made drunk,
and while in that condition the sale of
the lands was consummated; the pris
oner was set at liberty, but as he was run
ning from the jail he was shot dead by one
of the men on tuard.
All their lands on the east side of the
Mississippi River were sold. Black Hawk
says, for $1000 a year; other accounts say
$2000. I think Judge Spencer, in his
"Reminiscences," says the latter. He was
one of the old settlers of Rock Island. Ho
speaks of tfiack Hnwk as an honorable
and just man. Black Hawk pays:
"I leave it to tiie people of the United
States to say whether our nation was
properly represented in that treaty, or
whether we received justcompensationfor
the extent of country ceded by these four
individuals."
A clause in the sale said that the Indi
i ans might occupy the lands while they
! belonged to the Government.
Black Hawk's narrative is singularly de
[ ticient in dates. lie was the grandson of
Nana-makee, his father was Tyesa.and he
was born on. the shores of Rock River,
near where it empties into the Mississippi.
There he remained till he was 15 years
old, when he won honorable distinction
by wounding an enemy. This was the
first event of his life which he considers of
importance enough to record. He was in
battle with the Osages, wht?re he saw his
father kill a man and tear off his scalp.
This fired his ambition, and he attacked
and killed and sea I fed his enemy. There
were several expeditions against this trine.
In one of these his father was mortally
wounded, and after his death Black Hawk
fell heir to the great medicine bag of his
forefathers. In all his successes in battle
he recognizes the aid of the Great Spirit.
Finally there was peace among the
tribes and they settled quietly down in
their villages. It appears that the tribes
occupying the land in what is now Illi
nois, lowa and Wisconsin had been con
stantly at war with each other. The
Indians found the Rock River and Missis
sippi country exceedingly attractive. Toe
island of Rock Island was a favorite re- j

sort for the young people of the tribes. It
was there they had tbeir games and
dances. They felt that they had found
the most beautiful and desirable spot they
had ever seen, and determined never to
leave it. After their harvests had been
secured and the hunters had returned
laden with the spoils of the chase they
gave themselves up to their favorite
amusements. They raised corns, beans,
squashes and other vegetables, and cached
them for winter use. A deep hole was dug
in the ground, the vegetables were placed
therein and covered with earth and bark.
Frequently the contents of the cache were
stolen by their enemies by piercing the
ground with their spears.
Black Hawk was 35 years old when the
first American appeared. The Americans
had taken possession of the country about
St. Louis. The news of this filled the
tribe with apprehension, for, as Black
Hawk naively says, "We had always had
accounts of the Americans who lived near
the Indians."
The tribes frequently visited St. Louis
to see a person in authority whom he calls
"our Spanish fa; her," w'.io always treated
them well and gave them provisions. As
this account is taken from Black Hawk's
narrative, it is not known who was the
" Spanish father " referred to. Subse
quently he refers to "our American father"
at St. Louis.
The possessions of the Sacs and Foxes
extended as far as Peoria, and thence to
strike Ouisconsin River eighty miles from
its mouth down the river to the Missis
sippi. They owned the whole of lowa.
Colonel Davenport, who was an English
trader with the Indians, says: "As near
ly as I could ascertain these tribes came
from Canada â from a region near Mou
treai." Ti ey were governed by two sets
of chiefs â civil and war chiefs. The civil
chiefs settled troubles between tribes.
Black Hawk and Keokuk were the promi
nent war chiefs.
Black Hawk was determined to stay in
his village notwithstanding all the land
bad been ceded to the Government of the
United States by the treaty of 1804. But
as the white people were coming in
great numbers, seeing the beauty and
desirableness of this land so fair and so
fertile, they were continually encroaching
upon the domain of the Indians. It will
be remembered that there was a clause
in the treaty which allowed the tribes
to remain in their homes as long as the
land was in the possession of the
Government; but as the white people
came they settled wherever they pleased,
plowing up the fields which the Indians
had planted and appropriating the land
to their own uses.
It was determined to move the Indians,
but BlacK Hawk, profoundly impressed
with the injustice of the whites, deter
mined to await the arrival of the soldiers,
which had been threatened, with tneir
"great war cief." Accordingly, when
this personage arrived, a great council
was held. BlacK Hawk and his chiefs lis
tened to the speech made by General
Gains, "the war chief," warning them
that they had been told to leave the coun
try and go west of the Mississippi. Biack
Hawk replied:
"We have never sold our country; we
have never received any annuities from
our American father, and we are deter
mined to hold on to our village." The
war chief exclaimed :
"Who is BlacK Hawk? Who is Black
Hawk?" He replied:
"I am a Sac! My forefather was a Sac!
All the nations call me a Sac! 1 ' This sav
age nobleman of the forest thought this
enough, but was told that the general
neither came to beg nor to hire them to
leave their village.

The daughter of an old chief was sent to
the fort to ask that her people could re
main long enough to gather their crops in
the fields, and another deputation was
sent with the same request, but it was de
nied. Then a steamboat was anchored
near them full of soldiers. The Indians
crossed the river in the night. To com
pensate them for their crops, corn was
promised them, which, however, was en
tirely inadequate to their wants. The
women and children lamented being de
prived of the vegetables and in the night
a party went across the river to secure
vegetables from the fields which they had
planted. The whites had no regard for a
flag of truce, frequently shooting down the
bearer.
The war which terminated with the bat
tle of Bad Ax, in 1832, was then at an
end, after a great, reduction of the war
riors of Black Hawk's band. The Ameri
can forces were in command of General
Scott.
It has been said that Black Hawk's nar
rative is somewhat apocryphal, but I
think it is in the main true. It is a very
sad >tory. Antoine Le Claire, to whom it
was dictated, was a respectable citizen of
D.ivenport, held in equal esteem by whites
and Indians. In bis affidavit appended to
the narrative, he says:
"In accordance with Black Hawk's re
quest 1 acted as his interpreter. I was
particularly cautious to understand the
narrative throughout, and have no hesi
tation in pronouncing it true in every par
ticular."
Black Hawk's dedication of the work to
his captor, General Atkinson, is pathetic,
and a translation is here given. He was a
prisoner at Jefferson barracks, and at the
time he was 67 years old. He says to Gen
eral Atkinsoii :
"Sir! The changes of fortune have
made you my conqueror. The stor> of my
life is intimately connected with a part of
the history of your own. I have, there
fore, dedicated it to you. Before I bet out
on my journey to tJy) land of my fathers
I have determined to eive my motives and
reasons for my former hostilities to the
whites, and to vindicate my character
from misrepresentation. I am now an
obscure member of a nation that formerly
honored and respected my opinions. May
you never experience the humility that
the power of the American Government
has reduced me to is the wish of him who
in his native forests was once as proud
and bold as yourself. Black Hawk, tenth
moon, 1833."
This sketch is not a history of the war,
but more of a character ske'eh. That in
nate nobility and religious feeling of the
Sac as a nation is exemplified by an inci
dent wh eh occurred in 1841. It is told in
the souvenirs of the Prince de Joinvilie,
when he made the descent of the Mis
sissippi. The Territory of lowa, which
belonged to the Sacs and Foxes, was in
dispute between tlie whites and Indians
The Prince says in his book:
"A party of Indians came on board at
St. Louis. They were on their way to
Washington to lay tbeir grievances before
the President. They had the most reso
lute and impassive countenances and be
haved with the greatest dignity, never
showing any excitement, except when we
passed the confluence of the Mississippi
with the Missouri River. There was a
splendid sunt-et. The Indians assembled
in the stern of the boat and repeated a
kind of invocatory prayer. It was a per
fect picture. 1 '

Even in this day of railroad wonders, i
with engines that can spurt at the rate of '
112 miles an hour, it seems a remarkable
idea that provides for passengers chang
ing cars on trains that run at the rate of
sixty miles an hour without the slightest i
relation of speed. It is just this that the 1
invention of Charles E. Dosser, a well
known Syracuse man, makes possible of
accomplishment. He has designed a
wonderful traveling railroad station in
the lorm of a car with a vestibuled bridge
at the side.
Mr. Dosser's business takes him about
the country a great deal. In fact, he
makes his home largely on railroad trains.
Slow time and long waits have often been
his lot, and it was in trying to endure
these discomforts of the traveler's life
that the remarkable plan he proposes to
have executed arose in his brain, if only
some invention could be conceived by
which unfortunate passengers who long
for an express train but are fated to miss
it because they were at way stations could
gain their objer-t humanity would be ben
efited.
Then came the thought as to liow a
change of cars could be effected without
delaying the express train; that is, a
change from the local to the limited.
After studying the subject for more than
a year, Mr. Dosser has just evolved an in
vention which he hopes to see tried. It
provides for a limited train, or an express
that is unlimited, that shall run through
from New YorK to Chicago, for example,
without making a single stop, traveling
steadily at the rate of sixty miles an hour.
To bring this about he would have aux
iliary trains, each of which should pick up
passengers along 100 miles of territory.
Every train would be scheduled to be at a
certain station at the time the express was
due. By an arrangement with the tele
graph operator at the station beyond
which the auxiliary train was waiting, the
conductor thereof would receive notice
from the telegraph operator about five
minutes before the express arrived.
Then the auxiliary would pull out on
the track next to the one used by the ex
press and proceed to make time. The
time that It would try to make would be
sixty miles an hour, which would not be
a difficult tasfe, because the engine of each
auxiliary train would be of the very best
class and capable ol making high speed.
By the time the express was near the
auxiliary train the latter would be making
close to the desired speed, and both engi
neers would regulate the time they were
making so as to run neck and neck. Now
comes the change of passengers.
The transfer-car of the auxiliary has on
its side a door which opens inward. Folded
close to the side of the car. just outside
this door, is what seems to be the ordin
ary accordion-like coupling of a vestibule
train. There is, however, this difference,
it has no platform on which the passen
gers are to walk. The vestibule counling
is not directly on a line with the bottom
of the door, but about a foot above it,
fastened to two powerful arms of steel
which move up and down.
The express train, that stops for nothing
but accidents, also has a transier-car in its
make-up. There is a door in the side of
this car, iust as in the transfer-car of the
auxiliary. Outside, too, is the same ac
cordion-like vestibule, but in addition,
outside the vestibule and fastened to the
side of the car, the lower end resting upon
a stout arrangement of steel, is what re
sembles the gangway of a big passenger
steamer, minus the railing.
Looking again at the transfer-car of the
auxiliary it will be noticed that just Delow
the door are two heavy sockets. A little
distance on each side of the door and be
low the threshold are two more sockets
and on the transfer-car of the express is a
similar !irrangem o nt. Presently, when
the cars are running even and even, the
utility of, the invention is displayed.
From apertures in the side of each of the
transfer-cars steel I>.t-- appear â that is a
steel bar erne ges from the right socket of
the express-car and from the left socket of
the auxiliary. These bars are pushed at
an angle, fiat wise, so that when fitted in
tlie sockets on the two curs they are in
the form of the letter X and form most sub
stantial basis for a bridge. This done the
bridge is lowered from the express trans
fer-car until its outer edge fits firmly into
the socket just below the threshold of the
door of the auxiliary car. Then the vesti
bule coupling shoots out from each side
directly over the bridge and fits down
firmly upon it.
This is done in far less time than it takes
to relate the method of the invention and
njow the tranter of passengers from the
auxiliary to the express occurs. Both
trains are running at sixty miles an hour
all this while and the passengers walk
across from the auxiliary to the express
just as easily and comfortably as if they
were passing from one car to another in a
vestibule train.
The transfer complete, it is an easy
matter to replace the apparatus a3 it was
before the transfer took place.
Another necessary proceeding which
Mr. Dosser's invention provides for is the
transfer of baggage, and this takes place
in a similar manner to the transfer of pas
sengers. The vestibule is not quite so
elegant, but it is constructed from the
standpoint of strength rather than ap
pearance. The baggage is wheeled from
one train to another in the same manner
as it is liustled about a railroad station,
and as the time for the transfer of passen
gers and baggage is limited in each case
to ten minutes there is no time to waste.
The equipment of the trains under these
circumstances must be the very best, and
it will be an absolute necessity that the
roadbed be almost faultless, for any un
usual variation in motion or an ugly
jump woud be apt to have a bad effect on
the trains and result in disaster.
The feat of running a train -9CO miles
without a change of engine has rarely if
ever been accomplished. Add to this the
fact that no stoppage is to be made lor
either coal or water, and it can readily be
seen that Mr. Dosser's invention verges on
the marvelous. He proposes to have an
engine built with a tender that is like
nothing ever constructed of its sort in the
matter of size. Of course the fact that
there would be no stop and hardly any
slackening of speed would, in a measure,
reduce the usual consumption of coal by
the locomotives that are ordinarily re
quired to pull a train the distance men
tioned. It is proposed, however, that this
new tender shall be of sufficient size and
capacity to contain all the coal necessary
for the mammoth run. Water will be
taken from tanks beside the track stretch
ing aiong some distance, after the fashion
of the Pennsylvania fast trains.
This train that Mr. Dosser proposes to
have all records distanced by will of
necessity have improvements that genius
has still to conceive. For instance, the
engine must have especially constructed
journals on which provision is made to
avoid heating. Mr. Dosser proposes that
they shall be heavier and provided with
automatic oil cups, from which is to flow
a steady supply of oil. By a system of
pipes it is proposed to have these oil cups
constantly replenished from the cab of
the engine, an ordinary stop cork regula
ting the flow.
Mr, Dosser is very enthusiastic over his
invention, and believes there is no doubt
of its success if it is given a fair trial.

Afraid of the dark! Ah! never, I know!
For 'tis there that the fairies will whisper it
low ;
A tale of their lovely green mossy retreat,
Where to dance in the twilight together they
meet.
Where the will-o'-wisp comes with his pretty
bright light
To illumine the dance in the long, starry
night.
In the dark and the silence, when no one is
near.
The fairies wili whisper, then listen, and hear!
They'll tell where the wind hides on calm,
summer days,
And where the bees rest from their long hon
eyed ways.
Ah! yes; where stars keep their watch in the
suies.
They'll tell you their secrets, my pretty blue
eyes.
ho prob!ems of living, no long, troubled
nights,
But only to dream of the childish delights,
And only to hearken while fairies unfold
Their sweet sylvan secrets that never grow old.
Then afraid of the dark you never need be.
For 'tis then that the fairies will whisper to
thee. Corine L. Bartlett.

y\ Jtemarxtic Story of the Days of
Qood Kir\g Arthur.
[concluded from last week.]
He ceased, and the father, bending over
him, piaced his hands upon hi* head and
bade him depart, as his valor dictated to
him. So, before long, Tristram had
mounted a powerful steed and, accompa
nied by his tutor, had departed to Corn
wall. There he found the King despond
. ent and the whole court wrapped in
gloom, for they all feared that no knight
would appear to defend them and that the
tribute would have to be paid.
FOLLOW THE LEADER.
Tristram, seeing the state of affairs
approached the King and said :
"Sire, it ia most disgraceful tbat no
champion fcnisht has appeared to protect
Cornwall from shame. I am but an un
tried youth, yet, if you will grant me the
honor of knighthood, I shall meet this
Marhaus and battle for you and for the
right of the land."
The Kine looked at the youth and when
he saw the fire of battle glow in his eves
his heart was somewhat lightened of its
burden:
"Who are you?" be said, "and whence?"
"My name is Tristram and I came from
the court of Meliodas, who wedded your
; sister."
"But how shall I know you?" again the
King asked.
"Sire," the boy replied andthere was re
buke in his tone, "I was born in the coun
try of Lyonesse, and I am a gentleman
born."
"'Twas well answered," the king re
plied, "and it is not meet that I should
press you to speak more. If you will do
battle for me I will mafce you a knipht!"
"For that have I journeyed hither,"
Tristram said.
Tne King then sent word to Marhaus
that he had a champion, and when the
message reached him the young prince
I had already been kniehted.
To the chagrin of King Mark, who knew
not the royal birth of Tristram, he re
ceived this message from Marhaus:
"Think not I will hght with any knight.
My opponent must be of royal blood, the
son of a King or Queen, Prince or Princess.
With none other will I draw spear!"
Calling' Tristram before him the King
told him this, adding sorrowfully:
"This will debar yon from the contest,
and again I am without a chamt>ion."
"Tell Sir Marhaua," said Tristram,
"that ne shall joust with one better than
himself. For I am of both King and
Qjeen the child. Know, sire, that Melio
das is my father, and Elizabeth, your
sister, was my mother."
Then the king stepped down from his
throne ana took in his arms the son of his
sister, the brave and daring Sir Tristram,
who till this moment had hidden his high
lineage.
"Welcome, my nob'.e nephew," the King
cried in joy. "It is meet that kin should
stand by kin, and now Sir Marhaus has a
noble knight with whom to contend."
Immediately word was sent to Marhaus
that the son of King Meiiodas and nephew
to Kine Mark would be his opponent, and
answer was soon made that Sir ilarhau3
would be most blithe and glad to do battle
with so noble a champion.
According to the request of Marhaus,
the battle was to take place on an island
near which his ships were anchored. In
the morning, therefore, Tristram, clothed
in the richest materials that King Mark's
court afforded, was escorted with his horse
to a vessel and soon reached the island, on
the farther shore of which ne beheld the
ships of Marhaus. Accompanied by Gou
vernail, whom he had made his squire,
Tristram landed and was armed, and
when he had mounted his steed he said to
Gouvernail:
"Enter the ship and return to my uncle.
Tell him if I die honorably to give me
noble Christian burial. If I bear myself
ignobly, then let me not be so honored.
And on your life, come not near the island
till I am slain in fight or show the banner
of victory. Farewell!"
So resolutely did the Prince speak that,
much as he wished to remain near h m,
Gouvernail did not dare disobey him, but
departed and did all as he said.
The two knights then approached and
much courteous conversation passed be
tween them.
"I trust to win renown and honor, most

I 111 IjIJLP BJÂ» </â¢
noble Sir Marhaus, in this conflict with
you, and moreover I hope to free Cornwall
forever from the tribute to Ireland. To
this end 1 shall do my best in all honor
and valor."
" 'Tis well spoken, fair knight, and I
honor your spirit. But you will lose no
honor by standing well from me. For
King Arthur made me not a knight of his
Table Round for nothing."
"Think not I fear you. And if I show
thfi white featner in this encounter, then
may I never bear weapons again."
So saying Tristram drew bark, and both
knights tot k their places.
At the signal they rushed at each other,
their spears at rest, and vyith such force
did they come together that both were
unseated and fell heavily to earth. But
Tristram received a wound in the side
that bled profusely.
On foot they then fought; striking and
foiling; thrusting and sparring; rushing
together with furious force and drawing
back with heedful watchfulness; while
sword clashing on armor sounded like the
ringing of the anvil.
Four hours the conflict lasted and Mar
haus became faint and winded, but Tris
tram felt strong as ever. Then raising h.s
sword he put all his force into his right
arm, and striking down, smote Sir Mar
haus on the helmet; through the helmet
and head.till tho sword remained fast in
the skull. With all his might he tried to
draw it out, but tbe edge remained, and
Marhaus dropped on his knees. In a
moment, however, he was up, and throw
ing down his sword and shield fled to the
ship groaning, and they sailed away, while
Tristram called after him:
"How now, Sir Knigiit of the Table
Round! Why do you flee? Ratuer would
I be cut into a thousand pieces than fly
rom my enemy. Your shield and sword
I shall keep and shall wear them in the
presence of King Arthur and the Round
Table to show them that Marhaus has
fallen and that Cornwall is not a land of
cravens!"
Then in exhaustion he fell down, and
his squire found him so and carried him
to the castle, where for a month ha lay ill
of his wounds.
Then it was found that he was poisoned
by the blade of Marhaus' weapon, and a
wise woman said that only in the land
from which the poison came could he be
cured.
So Tristram went to Ireland, and under
the name of Tramtrist was received by
King Anguish himself, who, hearing his
exquisite music on the harp, wished to
keep him by him. So Tristram was cured
by the fiir Isolde, the daughter of King
Anguish. And they knew not that it was
he that had slain Marbans. For the knight
died after reaching the shore, and the
Queen saved the blade from his head that
she might avenge her brother's death.
But she knew not that Tristram was the
man. And so he dwelt with them, and
played upon the harp, and taught the
fair Isolde to play too. And so the sum
mer days passed by and both were happy.

JtaW JWo Little Qirls Stopped the
Legislature.
A TRUE STORY.
By Bertha Wollhnbero, 12 Years.
It was a day early in June, but the heat
was so intense that the flowers nodded
w< arily on their stems, and the songs of
the dear little wood birds were hushed.
We were living on a farm about two
miles from Phoenix, Ariz.
Any one who has ever visited that part
of the country during the summer months
knows how very warm it is, and this day
seemed to be the very hottest of the sea
son.
It was vacation, and Kalie, a friend of
mine, was spending hers with me.
Well, we had made oar plans to visit
another friend this day who lived in the
outskirts of Phoenix.
We had written to her of our intended
visit, and could not disappoint her, al
though we gladly would have postponed
our trip until cooler weather; and, besides,
all of our horses were to be used by a
party who were going on a hunting ex
pedition. Fortunately I owned a little
donkey, so we determined that we both
should ride him.
When all was ready off we started, in
gay spirits, each carrying a basket con
taining a little In nch.
We jogged along for about a mile, chat
ting and singing and full of life. Suddenly
I felt the saddle slip, slip, from side to
side and exclaimed, "Oh, Katie, what shall
we do? Our saddle is loose!"
As she was a city girl she Knew nothing
about tightening it, and as I had been a
countryu ntry girl only a short time I was as
ignorant as she.
"What shall we do?" asked Katie.
"Well, I'm hungry, aren't you?" "Yes."
"Suppose we eat our lunch then, and think
while we eat," was my reply.
Both jumped down, and leading our
little donkey to a tree, we soon had him
secured, although there was not much
danger of his running away.
Seating ourselves under another tree,
we went to work at our luncheon, which
tasted fine, and then each took a trial at
tightening the saddle, but with very poor
success.
We concluded finally that one of us
might safely ride, so off we started, one
taking a turn at trudging through the
dust in the heat, while the other rode.
Finally we came tD a large building, in
which there were many windows.
Mounted on the donkey, I was just high
enough to peep through one of the win
dows, and saw a roomful of men. In
front of them one stood reading, while all
the others listened with grave faces.
"Katie," I said (very polite to my com
pany, wasn't I?), "suppose you go in
there and ask one of those men to come
out and tighten our saddle, while I wait
here."
She took my advice and soon returned,
leading by the hand a very fine-looking
gentleman, whose face was beaming with
smiles. He solemnly tightened the girth
and helped us to mount. We thanked
him and went on our way.
We arrived at Susie* safe and sound,
and were warmly welcomed.
While eating the lovely dinner which
Susie's kind mother set before us we re
lated the story of our loosened saddle
and how we had sought and found help.
We were very much surprised and per
plexed when Susie's folks received our
story with shouts of laughter which we
thought ivould never come to an end.
Finally when the merriment had some
what subsided I asked to be told the jone.
"Do you know, my dear," said Susie's
father, "that you two little girls actually
stopped the Legislature in order that your
saddle girth might be tightened?"
"One of the gravest and most learned
of our law-makers hailed me on the street
a few moments before dinner-time to te!l
me how a little dusty girl with perspira
tion streaming over her face had boldly
walked into their great hall this morning
and asked him to please come out and
fasten her donkey's saddle, and how all
law-making stopped until he returned.
The legislators thought U aline joke and
had a good laugh, bat I had no idea that
you were the girls. Ha! ha! ha!"
We were forced to laugh ourselves, and
felt a little abashed And a little proud of
the fact that we had been the means of
stopping for a short time the work of one
Legislature.
Why ..fyilttj >W
Do you children know why the rabbits
have such long ears? The North country
people tell their little ones this story of it:
All the rabbits were very sad because
they were so small, so one day they met
together to see what could be done to
remedy the trouble. They thought of
many plans, and at last decided to send
Uncle Jack, the biggest and wisest of them
all, to the Father of Beasts to ask him to
make them larger.
The father said, ''I shall do as you wish,
but first I shall give you a task to per
form. Go and bring to me a red snake, a
swarm of wasps and a pint of tear?."
Then he gave to Uncle Jack three cala
bashes and sent him awayâ a calabash,
you know, is a bottle made of a dried
gourd. Uncle Jack wondered how he was
to find all these things, but he started
bravely on his journey.
At last he came to a wood where there
were many snakes. He walsed slowly
along saying, as if to himself, "I bet there
is room for himâ l bet there is room for
him." A red snake heard him and asked
what his words meant Uncle Rabbit re
plied: "The wasps say there is not room
for you in this calabash, and I bet you can
get in." "You will soon see who is right,"
paid the snake, and he crawled quickly in.
Then Uncle Rabbit popped in the stopper
and Mr. Red Snake was caught.
Then he went on, saying as before, '*!
bet there is room for them all â I bet there
is room for them all." The wasps heard
him and asked: "What do you mean by
those words?' "The snake says there is
not room for all of you in this calabash,
and I bet you can all get in," replied
Uucle Rabbit.
"We will soon see who is right about
that," said the wasps, and they tumbled
over each other in their haste to show
that the snake was wrong.
Then Uncle Rabbit popped the stopper
in the neck of that calabash and the wasps
were caught. Uncle Jack now resumed
his travels. Every one he met seemed to
be very merry, but he began after a while
to despair of ever filling the third cala
bash. One day he came to a pretty little
village in the center of whose public
square was a well. He drew near this
well; he began in a loud voice to cry and
lament. The women who had come to
draw water heard his cries and asked:
"Why do you cry so and lament?"
"Oh," said he, "why should I not cry
anci lament? To-morrow the world will
come to an end and we shall all perish."
This made the women cry also, and they
shed such quantities of tears that he had
his last calabash filled in no time. Then
he slung his three calabashes over his
shoulder and hurried back to the Father
of Beasts. When the father saw the red
snake and the swarm of wasps and the
bottle of tears he smiled and said, "You
are more cunning than any other beast of
the fields and do not need to be taken, but
as you wish it so much I shall at least
make your ears longer." So he pulled
Uncle Rabbit's ears, and ever since rab
bits' ears have been as long as you now see
them. Aunt Harriet.

Grandpa Griffin lived in the city, and
Tom and Luella were always delighted
when he came to the country to make
them a visit. He always brought some
thing that pleased them. Once it was a
beautiful doll for Lnella and a ball for
Tom. Another time Tom got a velocipede
and Luella a carriage for her doll. This
time it was only a pound of nice, fresh
candy, to be divided between the two chil
dren. In passing through the hall
grandpa laid the package on the lower
step of the stairway.
The little folks began to think that
grandpa had forgotten them this time,
when ha suddenly thought of the candy
and told them where to find it. They ran
quickly into the hall and there was Muff
on the step where grandpa had left the
candy. The box was torn open and only
two tiny pieces of candy were in it. Muff
had his paw on the broken box.
When he saw the children he wagged
his tail playfully, aud seemed to say that
he had enjoyed the candy very much. He
did not know that he bad robbed Tom
and Luella of grandpa's present. They
knew that Muff had a sweet tooth, but who
would have thought that even a big dog
could eat a whole pound of candy ?âSun

That one let the little mouse have a little run;
But this little mouse had gone but a little way
When the little cat, who enjoyed a little play,
Caught the little mouse again and gave him a

While the little mother cat exclaimed, "Ah, I

As the little mouso went through the little

In Hapless Babies' .Mouths
The Most Remarkable Mart in the World
Babies Purchased for Ghristmas
presents in London
William T. Stead, reformer, agitator
and philanthropist, has just furnished the
world a new scr ation by establishing in
London a baby market. So novel is the
idea that the big, conservative city has
gone into ccstacies over the plan sug
gested and the man whom it once
forced, because of his. charitable deeds,
into cue Old Bailey. Mr. Stead's latest
suggestion is that there is no better Christ
mas present than a pretty baby, and he
declares he knows there are many couples
who would be only too delighted to make
their family three instead of two if they
knew where to go to secure an acceptable
third.
The scene of Mr. Stead's baby market,
or, as some term it, baby exchange, is a
prettily furnished suite of apartments in
one of the eminently respectable portions
of the English metropolis. The object of
attempting this experiment wus. in a
nutshell, to create an institution that
would prove a medium for finding chil
dren for married couples entirely without
family but who felt the desire tp fill up
the blank in their hearts and homes by
adopting as their own some of the borne*
among the little ones.
In every large city there is a very great
number of children who have entered the
world under circumstances, that make
their retention by motheror father a mat
ter unpleasant and difficult. The children
are in every respect desirable, as a rule,
for, judging irom the qualities of their
progenitors, there is no reason why, if
iWaced in proper environment, they
should not become worthy men and
women. The principal trouble has been
for couples desirous of adopting children
to hnd some place where they could pur
sue their quest without danger of suffer
ing from deceit, or bitterly repenting a
hasty bargain when it was too late to
escape the consequences.
It is just exactly this want that the
baby market lilis. To the comfortably
furnished rooms where the babies who
may be adopted together with absolutely
c rrect information concerning them are
to be :ound many women, young and old,
charming and ugly, wend their way every
(Jay to see just what specimens of juvenile
beauty are candidates for home honors.
There are plenty of them, and like men,
of all sorts and conditions, except that in
every instance when they are placed on
view in the market they are absolutely
clean. Mr. Stead and his confreres hold
that cleanliness >s not only next to god
liness, but an absolute requisite prelimi
nary to adoption.
So the baby races shine under tbe
benignant influences of soap and water,
and if chubby hands undo the work of
the washing apparatus, why, the scrubbing
process is repeated. The picture that ac
companies this article graphically por
trays the scene that is daily witnessed in
the visitors' room of the baby market.
One cay's experience in this placa is a
wbola foiume in tde study of human na
ture. Women whose faces are snarled
with frowns and wrinkles change counte
nance entirely as soon as t^.ey catch a
plimpse of the healthful, lusty contents
of the visitors' room. Pretty women grow
prettier at the sights they see.
Of course, the babies are like all other
hnmanity, both bad and good. But the
well-treated, weli-fed and weil-washed
baby is not inclined to be ill natured, and
bo all look their prettiest and smile their
sweetest at the tender-hearted women
who come to view them on adoption bent.
The babies vary in age from six months
to three years, but the tenderer age pre
dominates. These are some of the entries
in ihe baby book, no names being given:

Tue numbers given witti the entries are
those by which the babies are known, as
th -y have no names. These poor young
sters start in life as guiltless of iJentity as
the convict in the Spanish prison Inferno
at Ceuta, tha: portion of Africa which is
given over to Hades.
Sometimes it happens that children" bÂ£
yonti the customary age of those who
make up the bulk of the market's stock in
trade seek parents and hone for would-be
parents to ssek them. For instance, the
mother of two littlo boys, 8 and 5 years
old respectively, recently wrote to Mr.
Stead, asking him to find a home for her
children. The death of her husband had
left her almost destitute. These two little
fd.ows are grandsons of one of the best
known Judges of India.
As a rule, the antecedents of a child are
not revealed, owing to the fact that inno
cence would frequently be forced to suffer
for the guilt cf others. Such instances as
the one quote l are by no means rare, for
in England as in no other country it is
the case that cood blood and poverty often
dwell together.
While it is not always the case and per
haps not in the majority of instances that
a baby is sold as if it were an infantile
specimen of the pug dog, it is true that it
not infrequently happens that a mother
receives a cash consideration for parting
with her little one. Generally it occurs
that persons who are desirous of procuring
ready-made children are plentifully sup
â¢ plied with this world's goods. Therefore
it is quite natural thai they should offer |
no objection to and generally preier giv
ing a reasonable compensation to the lorn
mother.
It sometimes happens, however, that the j
foster parents reverse this order of things, j
ai\d after selecting a desirable youngster, ]
inquire how much they are to be paid for
taking it. This class of persons are
frowned upon by Mr. Stead, and he has
just now formally notified them that their
presence at the baby market is not de
sired and will be promptly dispensed
with if avoidable in no other fashion.
The scenes at the baby market are like
unto those of a big nursery. Prettily
gowned and capped nurses exhibit their
charges to the persons who come to view,
and occasionally a sad-faced woman is
seen sitting in a chair in the visitors'
room, hoping for the opportunity that
will make her grief-stricken. Such a one
holds her baby as close to her as possible,
undergoing in her imagination the apony
of parting over and over again. Then
when the prospective foster-mother
finally appears the contrasting feelings
are almost pitiful. It is a mingling of
tears and smiles. The tears ot the mother
contrast with the smiles of the newcomer,
while the baby tries first one and tiien
the other emotion, unknowing whether
its mother's grief or the visitor's joy mean
the most to it.
There is only one other institution in
the world so far as known like unto that
which Mr. Stead has established. It is
not really a prototype after all. The same
principle, however, actuates both â that of
caring for little ones and providing them
with good homes. This second institu
tion is in the United States, and is pre
sided over by Dr. J. H. Kellogg at Battle
Creek, Mich., a town that is famous for
the lost health that is found there and re
turned to the owners.
This haven ol iest and hope for young
persons has no restriction, so far as age is
concerned, regarding tbe children it aids.
In the eyes of the institution the girl of
16 13 still a child and requires infinitely
more care in some ways than the tot of 6.
This institution is known as the Haskell
Home, but it is a home only temporarily,
as the children are placed with the per
sons desirous of adopting them as soon as
possible. The/cla3s of children that are
received by the home is indicated by the
following description of several home
se kers furnished by the officials:
No. 366 is a girl 10 years of age with
blue eyes and dark hair. She is said to
nave an amiable disposition and has had
good training. Her father is dead and
her mother having to work away from
Meteoric Iron and Diamond.
home all day the child is thus left alone.
The mothe- is anxious to have her placed
in a good Christian home where she will
havj proper care and trainin â¢. She is at
present living in Pennsylvania.
Nos. 276 and 377 are two little girls, aged
12 and 9 years respectively, with black
eyes and hair. The mother has tried to
keep the family together. But as she is
in very poor health she can no longer sup
port them. These children are said to be
easily controlled, and no doubt would
brighten and cheer some home. They are
now living in Nebraska.
Nos. 378 and 379 are two bright, father
less little boys, aged 6 and 3 vear3 respect
ively, living in Wisconsin. Their mother
is so situated that she cannot possibly
rare for them and support them, and is
anxious to have them placed in good
Christian homes. They have blue eyes and
light hair.
No. 380 is an orphan girl, 10 years of age,
living in Massachusetts. She has blue
eyes and brown hair and is large and
strong for her age. She has a very affec
tionate disposition, being very fond of
children and petÂ«. She has been living
with an elderly lady, who has cared for her
since her mother's death, but she is not
able to provide for her longer. No doubt
with a kind but firm hand to guide her
and the surroundings of a Christian home
she will crow up to be a useful woman.
No. 381 is a little girl nearly 6 years old,
living in Wis-cons-in. Her mother is dead
and her father has deserted her. Her
aunt, with whom she has been staying, is
not situated so that she can keep her
longer, ar.d thus she is in need of an im
mediate home. S c has blue eyes and
light hair, and is said to be bright and
well behaved. Is there not some home
that will open its doors and give this poor
child a mother's love and care?
The homeless baby is everywhere, and
so is the household where childish voices
are never heard. It seems a pity, the
humanitarians say. that the composite
pans of a delightful whole should be so
ofte"n separated. The baby market is
likely to become an American institution.

Sonoma County's Picturesque Indians Will HaVe Become
Extinct Before the Close of /inotker Qeneration
The Indians of Sonoma County form an
interesting and picturesque element of
life in the valley of the Ru-sian River.
All told they number at the present day
barely 300 sonls, the remnant of tbe once
powerful tribe of the Callagomanns,
which, at the tim^ of the Spanish occupa
tion, numbered 50,000 individuals. Dis
ease, exposure and change of habit hav.e
eliminated the once powerful people, and
it is hardly possible for them to exist for
another generation. In a few years the
tribe will become extinct.
The term "Digger," by which all the
tribes ol Northern California were <iistin
gui->hed, was app ied to them from their
habit of digging into the earth for food.
They were promiscuous in their choice of
eatables, and rabbits, snakes, earthworms
and snails were esteemed the most deli
cious elements wherewith to grace a feast.
Like their forefathers, the race in
Sonoma County is neither warlitce nor
enterprising. The country before the
arrival of tbe whites afforded ail that was
necessary to gratify their narrow wants
witbont labor upon their part. They
knew nothing of the chase and caught
their game by stratagem or snare, conse
quently they grew up an inconceivably
lazy and utterly worthless people, without
a conception of a future state and only
intent on the gratification oi degraded
appetites. When the whites possessed
the lands and covered them with droves
of cattle and sheep the Indians imagined
they had a right to appropriate what they
required, and did so until the stronger
race arose in their wrath and wiped out a
few hundred of them, more or less, when
the Hocks and herds were left in peace.
Around Hcpland the largest number of
this remnant live. In pity the church un
dertook the work of civilizing the few that
were left, and devoted missionaries have
passed their lives trying to instill into the
minds of these people hopes of better
things. Instruction has been given in ag
riculture, and the Indians have been en
couraged in habits of self-dependence and
industry. In a measure these efforts to
civilize have ben successful. They are
nearly all members of the church and re
gard thtir priest, with great veneration,
but their minds can only grasp the rudi
ments of the principles of Christianity.
In their chapel they are the most devout
of worshipers. The school where the

purpose. When a terrestrial diamond

bition without which any considerable
progress is impossible.
The females of the tribe are more tract
able than the men and more easily
taught. Some of them make notable
housewives and needlewomen.
They have been encouraged to build
homes of their own after the manner of
those of their white neighbors, and many
have done so, but there are those who are
so inert that they cannot be induced to
make any effort at improving themselves
or their estate. They adhere to customs
of their forefathers and live a3 their an
cestors did before the white man came to
disturb their dreams and make them work.
The little that the Indians raise from
their land is supplemented by the wages
they earn on the neighboring farms. Hop
picking is a favorite occupation of theirs,
and whole families engage in that task
when the time for gathering the crop ar
rives. As fruit-pickers they are also a
success, but in other branches of work,
where judgment or some intellectual ef
fort is required, they are a failure.
SONOMA COUNTY INDIANS' HUT.
Hissing sound soon announced that the
adamantine surface was yielding, and in a
few minutes the ground and polished face
proved that it had met its peer in the
white powder of the meteorite. This
skilled experimenter was of the opinion
that further analysis might even disclose
gems of size and value or give some clew
as to their formation, for which the past
career of the meteorite may have afforded
special facilities. Of the true origin of
both, however, much more must be known
before the shooting star is recognized as
diamond- bearing soil cast up from the
depths of some distant world.

They are a people fond of amusement,
and a circus occasions them unspeakable
delight. A procession of Indians bound
to a circus is a signt that would please a
cynic. The most dilapidated horses and
harness hitched to a cart of ancient
lineage and filled with a stoical group of
Ind.ans, old and young, is a spectacle
worth a long journey to see.

are lazy. The trait is innate and part of
their being. Only the sternest necessity
will persuade them to depart from the
habit. Their ruling passion is for drink,
and for this they will part with the last
of their possessions. Their conception of
bliss begins and ends with the bottle and
potations innumerable. The law against
supplying tbe Indians with intoxicants
is severe, but is constantly evaded.

made a visit to the tribe for artistic studies,

Is a Shorthand System
For .Music a Possibility?
Some J^eW ar\d Startling propositions or\tke
Stenography of JMvjsic and the
Function of Hearing
Among the inquiries I have received J
from readers of The Call are two thai '
bear upon the same subject. One reader i
asks: "Is it possible to devise a system of '
shorthand for music so that one may be J
able to report an aria similar to the way
in which a speech is reported? ' The other
one asks: "Is the X ray applicable to
deafness. Can a deaf person be made to
hear by the application of the X ray?"
The human senses are few, and may be
said to consist of five only â sight, hear
ing, taste, smell and touch. Of them,
hearing is much theacutest. Taste, smell
and touch involve but the simplest of
natural phenomena. Sight is more com
plex, as it necessitates the adaptation of
the optic nerve to changes in distance and
color of the object. Hearing necessitates
a far greater power of discrimination. The
variety of sounds is infinite. In addition
to tone, in its fundamental character, are
also pitch, quality, intensity and har
mony. We hear a note of music, and un
less a study has been made ol the science
of harmonic sounds, we infer that the
word "musical note" expresses fully all
that there is to it. Such is far from the
fact. Each note is a composite of many
sounds. Probably a thousand composite
sounds are combined to form the single
note. Science has to some extent an
alyzed the so-called "note." Strike, say,
the note C upon tbe piano. It contains,
in addition to the fundamental tone C, tbe
C an octave above, the twelfth above, C
two octaves above, .he major third two
octaves above, the fifth two octaves above,
and so on ad infinitum. Every regular
musical tone is resolvable into a definite
number of simple tones whose relative
pitch follows the law of the partial tone
series. These extra tones are termed the
"harmonies, "and a tone without harmon
ies is destitute of penetrating qualities.
Each tone has -a definite rate of vibra
tion, and tone's vibration bears a
fired relationship to the vibration of the
fundamental note. So calling the vibra
tion of the fundamental note 1, tfie sec
ond note of the scale will have a rate of
vibration expressed by the fraction 9-8,
the minor third 8-5, the major third 54,
the fourth 4-3 the filth 3-2, the minor
sixth 8-5, the major sixth 5-3, the minor
seventh 16-9, the major seventh 15-8 and
the octave 2-L
In addition to the sound of the note it
sell there are accompanying shades of
quality, loudness, softness, force, timbre,
etc, all of which go to making the expres
sion of the note. The musical sten> graph
er would, therefore, require to be the pos
sessor of an extremely acute ear capable of
instantly distinguishing each separate
shade and color of every individual note.
He would require a separate symbol for
each, and as the compass of an ordinary
piano of seven and a quarter octaves em
braces eighty-eight notes the number of
symbols necessary to express these notes
would prove too many for practical use.
It is, however, extremely easy with suit
able apparatus to cause any sound to give
a visual expression of itself. If we adjust
a tuning fork having a small mirror fixed
to the extremity of one of its arms so that
a ray of light coming from a lamp shall be
projected from the mirror upon a screen
then it will be seen that as the fork
vibrates the reflected ray will have an
undulatory, wave-like motion, which will
be characteristic and distinct for the same
note. The accompanying illustration
shows some of these line?. It might be
possible by the employment of delicate
and complex mechanism to obtain in such
lines a record of a piece of music being
performed.
The action of toe phonograph is tbe
practical application of such principle.
The phonograph is not a very modern in
vention. There has been lying upon the
shelves of the Smithsonian Institution at
Washington, D. C, a queer-shaped instru
ment called a pbonautograph, the device
of M. Leon Scott. It has been there since
1855 and was known to numberless experi
menters long previous. It consists of a
wooden cylinder about a foot long and six
Inches thick, having an iron axle, one end
of which is cut with a coarse-thread screw,
and the other end having a crank
handle.
The screw end of the axle works in a fixed
nut, so that when the cylinder is turned
by its handle it has, in addition to its mo
tion of rotation, a motion of translation.
There is a large funnel mounted upon a
stand, the apex of the funnel being closed
by a piece of parchment to which is af
fixed a quill. The phonautograph is em
ployed for making sound visible. To op
erate it the cylinder is covered with a
piece of paper and then rotated over a
lamp burning turpentine, so that the cyl
inder receives a heavy coating of iamp
black. Then, tne funnel is placed in posi
tion so that the quill is resting against
the periphery of the soot-covered cylinder.
If now a note of music is sounded into the
large end of the funnel and the cylinder
be rotated, the vibration of the air in
the funnel wHI cause the quill to trace
upon the revolving cylinder a sinuous
line, typical of tbe note. To preserve the
record tlie cylinder is dipped into a solu
tion of shellac in alcohol, which fixes the
lampblack, and the paper may then be
removed.
This is the original of the present pho
nograph. It was simply necessary to
harden the tracing made by the quill in
the lampblack and then to reverse the
revolution of the cylinder while the quill
was pre- sing against it to reproduce the
no c originally sounded into the funnel.
Now,- while such a machine will faithfully
produce a mechanical expression of what
ever musical sounds may be confided to it,
yet it cannot be classed as a stenographic
recorder, in the sense of the word "steno
graphic" as applied to the art of recording
in shorthand. A reporter would find ex
treme difficulty in reporting stenograph
ically any musical composition. The dis
tance of the hearer from the source of
sound has a very important bearing upon
the sound as heard. If we take two tele
graphic sounders and by clockwork
arrange to break the electric circuit ten
times per second we shall hear the sounds
of the two instruments as one, provided
they are placed upon the table by which
we stand. But If one sounder be removed,
say twenty-five feet distant, then the
sounds they omit fail to coincide, owing
to the slowness with which soiled travels,
and in this position we shall hear twenty
strokes per second instead of ten. Re
move the sounder to a distance of 112
feet, and now the strokes are in unison,
ten per second. The pitch of a sound in
creases as the sound approaches us and
diminishes as it receeds. Leibnitz defines
music as "an occult exercise of the mind
unconsciously performing arithmetical
calculations."
In the basilar membrane of the human
ear are several thousand delicate fibers
each of which is set in sympathetic vibra
tion by a vibratory motion of a certain
RESONATORS.
definite period. These fibers are connected
with the constituent filaments of the au
ditory nerve, and by them tne simple pen
duiar motions which are singled out from
the complex vibratory motions, excited
by most sonorous bodies, are transmitted
to the brain, where they are translated
into the sensations we call sound. And
here begins the unsolvable mystery. We
are utterly ignorant of the nature of the
action of the brain in translating mechani
cal motion â vibration â into what appeals
to our senses as sound, light or heat.
Various devices have been produced for
the purpose of re-enforcing sound. They
are called resonators. Some of these are
so simple and produce such marvelous re
sults that I deemed it interesting to the
readers of The Call to make brief men
tion of them. They are simple trumpets.
One of them is constructed with a sliding
tube by means of which the length may be
increased. By putting the small end of the
tube of this resonator, known as Daugins',
to the ear and adjusting the slide, the
sounds of the waterfall will be resolved
into their elementary tones. The whist
ling of the wind, the rumbling of a car
riage over the street and the confused mur
mur of the city's multitude will be heard
with every variety of pitch and quality.
During the still hours of the night the atÂ«
mosphere, quiescent as it seems, is always
more or less vocal, and with this instru
ment one may hear every sound.
By the use of the other resonator one
may hear a melody that does not exist by
means of an instrument that emits do
sound. When the apex of the instrument
is placed to the ear and the three holes
successively covered and uncovered the
length of the aerial column in the
resonator is changed, causing it to corre
spond with some notes in the confused
maze of very feeble sounds, which unceas
ngly keep the air in a state of greater or
less perturbation.
Where deafness is the result of a failure
of the auditory nerve or the destruction
of the whole or a portion of the baailar
membrane, I do not believe it possible to
restore the sense of hearing. Where such
membrane and nerve is intact, but
atrophied, it may be possib c by the intel
ligent use of the so-called X ray to assist
the sense of hearing. I say it may be.
We as yet know very little about the

I have repeatedly held, in previous papers
iv The Call, that light, heat, sound and
electricity were one and the same thing,
differing only in the rate of the primal
substance vibration. The subtle action
of the brain, which converts the sonorous
vibrations into recoenized 3ound, is, in
my belief, an electrical operation, and I
see no good reason why it will not be
possible to at least aid hearing by the use
of a refined current of electrical energy
so soon as we have learned how to prop
erly apply it. F. M. Close, D.Sc.

The late Profes-or Henry E. Parker of
Dartmouth College was chaplain of the
Second New Kami shire Volunteer Regi
ment in the War of the Rebellion. An in
cident of his service is thus described by a
correspondent of the Springfield (Mass)
Republican:
"In the midst of the wild rout and panic
at the first battie of Bull Run I was
stricken down with a grievous wound.
While the tide of fugitives swept past and
the victorious enemy bore down relent
lessly upon us, a few comrades struggled
10 bear me away to 3ome place of safety.
Wiih them was Chaplain Parker. He had
been mounted all through the oattle, and
to reach me he had ridden into a perfect
hailstorm of bullets. It seemed certain
death to one so conspicuously exposed,
but be came out unharmed, while those
around him went down or fled in dismay.
Among the innumerable acts of heroism
which I witnessed during the war, noth
ing so impressed me as the calm courage
with which this was d ne."

Managers say that good new plays are
not to be had for fame or money, and
after seeing "Captain Bob" I can quite be-
Jievw it. Nothing but an absolute dearth
of novelty could have induced Wilton
Lackaye to take hold of such an amateur
ish production as Robert Drouet's comely
drama.
Comedy drama is a very ambiguous
term ; it may mean anything, from scream
ing farce to melodrama "built round"
bombshells and ponderous machines,
threatening to crush out human life.
When you patronize a new comedy drama
you pay your money and take your
chances, very much as you do on buying a
lottery ticket. Those of us who took
chances in "Captain Bob" found it to be
a compromise between melodrama and
comedy. The hallowed old characters of
melodrama w?re thereâ the betray r and
the betrayed, the lachrymose father, the
ingenuous heroine, the faithful remincrs
and the flawless hero â but Robert Drouet
had made these characters more gay and
festive than authors generally do who use
them for melo'irarnatic purposes.
A large slice of the comedy in "Captain
Bob" centers round ths stealing of a
chicken by a gentleman who, like "Ma
Angeline," was "not colored" but was
"born that way." After slaying his prey
he withdraws to an old forge to devour it
in secret, but no sooner is the cooking of
his feast under way than Miss Donna, ac
companied by Captain Bob, appears on
the scene, Â»nd, scenting the succulent
odor of fried chicken, the fair girl declares
that she is ravenously hungry and must
have food. To oblige her Captain Bob
Impersonates the chicken's rhost and,
after a lengthy dialogue, succeeds in scar
ing off the gentleman of color, who leaves
ihe lovers to devour the remnants of the
least.
This episode is oniy one of several
which impress on the audience that the
bill of fare is meager in the household of
Miss Donna (tiie young lady does not
Beera to have a surname). After Captain
Bob has rescued from a watery grave the
melodramatic lady, whom the villain had
betrayed, he is discovered in Donna's
house, sitting by the fire, with a cup of
coffee at his elbow. The possession of this
coffee seems to weigh heaviir on his soui,
and one gathers that the reason is b 'cause
the melodramatic lady in the next room
is coffeeless. After stirring the precious
dainty, and, if I mistake not, sippini it,
Captain Bob makes a sudden heroic effort
at selt-renuncia.ion and hands the cup to
the comic "msramy," remarking: "Take
it to her, poor girl; she needs it more
than I do." This touching episode re
calls the conduct of Sir Philip Sidney at
the battle of Zutphen, when he snatched
t!;e only glass of water in the army from
his own parched lips and handed it to a
dying soldier, observing: "Thy need is
greater than mine." But was that the
only cup of coffee procurable in the Dor.na
household?
In spite of the clever interpretation
given it by the La^kaye company "Cap
tain Bob" drags its length along wearily
through two acts, and just as every one is
beginning to yawn and wonder whether
the last car has gon<> the pity suddenly
TJtills itself together for a good finish. I
cannot imagine how Robert Drouet. who
wrote th_Â« dreary monologues of the first
two acts, managed to conceive so much
action as he has put into the last act. Not
tbat the act is great, by any means, but it
has stirring scenes and sends the audience
on its way rejoicing. The real merit of
"Captain Bob," however, is in affording a
thoroughly sympathetic role 10 Wilton
Lackaye.
There is nothing but trood to record ol i
the curtain-raiser, "Moliere, 1 ' except that j
ii the father of Fetich comedy could come !
forth from his tomb and assist at a repre- j
sentation he would not reco.Miize his own
language "as she is spoke" by some mem
bers of the Lackaye Company; that cele
brated Moliere play, for instance, in which
old Argan dallies with all the remedies in I
the pharmacopoeia. When Miss Wain- j
wright discussed it she pronounced the j
noun as if it were the name of the cele- j
brated and lamented American composer j
who wrote ' Waiting" and other popular
ballads, and in the adjective she dweit
lovingly and tenderly on the word ghi.\
The effect of the whole was "Le HillarJ i
-' â  : â â : ;; 'â 
1 M ' f â¢ %â . â 
f ot^'
immag-Tin-ncr". It might be better, under
the circumstances, to call the piny "The
Hypochondriac" and avoid trifling with
the French language.
But the most jarring feature in "Mol
iere" Is the constant occurrence of the
word "madame." Every one knows that
tne actcrj and actresses who visit our
shores invariably make it a pointof honor
to pronounce madarae as if it were writ
ten ma-damn. It, may be that they are
glad to embrace an opportunity of doing
a little swearing unrebukeaâ or, giving
them the benefit of the doubt, they have
never heara the word pronounced a la
Francaise. At any rate, it is a stage tra
dition to proncur.ee madame thus, and
the Wilton Lackaye company follows it,
alas! so faithfully, that "Moliere" is liter
ally strewn with big, big D â j.
I believe a taste for melodrama is an
acquired habit like smoking or eating
Limburger cheese. At first it makes yon
sick, then you pity, then endure and then
embrace. This has been the history of the
Columbia Theater habitues during the last
few week?. Th'ywere not used to melo
drama and looked askance upon "Human
ity" with surprise and suspicion. The
ladies were afraid of the shooting and
clung to their seats in horror while the
bombshell was spluttering away within
a foot of the hero. It was not him that
they trembled fot but th*>mselV3Â». When
"The New South" was put on the habitues
ventured but timidly, in twos and threes,
ami said tnat they never wouM have come
at all if they had not heard that th<? play
was much les? sensational than "Human
ity." They were beginning to got the melo
drama habit, but they would notown it.
"The Cotton King" last week completed
the work of degeneration, or regeneration â
the way you look at it all depends upon
whether you have ths habit yourself.
People who had been in douDt during
the run of the first two plays went to see
"The Cotton King" and returned the next
night, bringing tneir friends and now
Messrs. Friedlander, Gottloh & Co. can
saf ;ly produce plays "built round" any
piece of machinery that threatens human
life, for the habitues of the Columbia
Theater have acquired the melodrama
habit.
Mrs. Kendal has been declaring, not
necessarily as a guarantee of good faith
but for publication, that ihe stage "is a
most terrible, a most awful lile for a
woman. Nay, it is the most terrible, the
mott awful in the world for a woman.
To succeed in it she must have the epi
deirnia of a rhinoceros, the strength of a
mac and the icelings, say, of a graven
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1896.
imare. I spegk stronjrly. I feel strongly
on the subject, and, remember, I know
what I am talking about."
Mrs. Kendal may know what she is
talking about, but it is strange that she
should have staved with this life of trial
and tribulation for so many decades â I do
not know how many, out enousrb for her
to know her own rainri. Msny years ago,
when she was young and charming, Mrs.
Kendol said that no woman ought to act
after she was forty, but she had forgotten
all about that before her forty-fifth birth
day, and now she bids fair to become one
of the grand young actresses of the next
century.
Mary Anderson is another actress who
speaks slightingly of her own profession.
Her autobiograuhy is full of snrers at the
stage, but she too stayed with it for a long
time. 1 have been wondering, if tiese
feted and wealthy ladies find the theater
such a pathway of thorn*', what it must be
for the little chorus and ballet girls, who
tremble at the stage manager's frown and
who go through their little parts with the
knowledge that a wrnng step or a false
note may mean dismissal and no bread in
the cupboard next week. These girls have
grievances of their own. What member of
thedranmtic profession has not? But the
chorus and ballet know betterthan to pro
claim their woes Irom the housetop; it
would be as much as their bread and but
ter is worth.
Talking of ballets, I looked in at the Or
plieum the other day, to see a rehearsal of
the Christmas ballet, and Adrien Kiralfy
assured me that by the lime t c festive
season arrived ho would have all the girls
dancing in time and on tneir toes. He
knows his business, so I did not venture to
contradict him, but after seeina the re
hearsal, I wondered whether be was notof
too hopeful and buoyant a nature.
There were tsll girls and short girls, fat
girls and thin girls, girls in bloomers and
girls in voluminous skirts, but with possi
bly one exception, they all seemed to be
imbned with the fixed idea that the he
ginning, the middle and the end of the
art of dancing lies in Kicking as high as
possible. The exceprlon was a littlo dark
girl in a loose-fitting gown, who swayed
rhythmically to ilie music with her
whole body, and whose head bent
as gracefully as a rose rocked by the
breeze. She came down to the footlieh's
smiling and showing a flashing set of
teeth, and ber wiles reminded me of
those practiced by the ereat ballerine, who
never come to the Pacific Coast. Of
course thÂ» girl danced by nature, for she
had none of the acrobatic agility of a
trained dancer.
With the exception of this nymph,
Kiralfy was dealing with somewhat raw
material. "Forward, my children, 1 ' he
cried, and lump, lump, Jump, kick, kick,
kick was the response from forty pairs of
feet, while forty toes waved in the air like
so many signals of distress. "Lazy, luzy,
ah! little fet lszy," cried the ballet mas
ter, banging down his hands on the piano
and stamping his feet at a little per
son in cloth bloomers, who was what
schoolboys call "funking" her share of the
performance. The little fat la^y gave a
kick, just to prove what she could do
when goaded on to it, and the ballet roas
ter remarked, parenthetically: "They
haf not the education of coryphees from
the great dancing schools of Europe.
They haf been taught all wrong, but I
like the American dancers better than
Italians, French, Germans, English.
They haf more intelligence, more vivacity.
Give them the years of training dancers
have in Europe. Aii! there would be
coryphees!" and Kiralfy roiied his eyes
upward, as if a vision of the paradise of
Mohammed had been vouchsafed him.
While :he ballet was resting from its ar
duous exertions I chatted with some of
the brightest girls and found that in their
humble little way they were cierishinj
humble little ambitions of tneir own. "It
takes a fortune to be educatei fora pre
miere, and I can't afford lessons," said the
little dark-eyed dancer. "Lots and lots of
premieres have graduated out of the ballet
though, aid that's wiia\ I hope to do."
"1 d rather be a singer." said a little per
son, with big serious eves, who did not look
over 14. "My mother is letting me have a
few lessons and they say I am a very high
soprano, but you see there was a chance to
earn something in the ballet, so I applied. "
Practical little peoplel Haw bravely they
seemed determined to make the most
of their poor little chances. If they ever
withstand the temptations and hardships
of their lot and battle their wa/ out of
the ranks they will be able to talk with
more authority than the pampered Mrs.
Kfiiual about needing "the epidermis of
a rhinoceros and the strength of a man."

wrong people are suspected and it is only j
through tne f-xerrions of a heroic police

It has been feared for some weeks past
that the attack of typhoid fever irom
which Moriiz liosonihal was suffering in

THE BROWNIE MAN IN TOWN.
j-ioW Palmer Gox, an Old-Jime Sar\
Franciscan, Found the
Little people.
Palmer Cox, the artist, who went years
ago from San Francisco to New York to
find fr.rue as an illustrator of fees and hob
goblins, is living at present in an atmos
phere permeated with Brownie?. He is
personally conducting his play, "The
Brownie?," through the length and
breadth of the land, and he has just
piloted the company to this City, where
he used to dream of Brownies when he
was a boy.
The artist-illustrator is accompanied by
a gentleman named Doubles, who wrote
(he music for 'The Brownies,", and who
is so exactly like a Brownie himself that
you have to look at him twice to be quite
Mire that lie is not a fantaaje cf Palmer

a Palmer Cox Brownie continues to fas
cinate you and compels yon to keep your
eyes glued on him in a vay which is rot
consistent with the rules of good breeding.
' But as if. Mr. Douglas and the company
were not enough ,BroÂ«nieland,-; Palmer
Cox has to keep thÂ«* ball rolling by talking
continually. about' Brownies -anil 'spending
his leisure momenta in drafting them, us
lie is under a fifteen years' contract to go
evolving them continually out ot his inner

And Cox has logo- on telling lre^h relays
visitors how.it came about that he in
varied the realms of Brownicland. '
It seems :ttiat he was* writing for chil

Explanation.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top figures
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
Cays: those underneath it. if any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and hundredtlis,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
Â«lnes, connect pom s of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
won; "hieh" means iiUli barometric pressure and
Is usually aceomoanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
. and acoorr,panied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" as al,a 1 , y first appear on the Washington
coast. When :he pressure Is high in the interior
ana low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south alon; the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" is Inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
J the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected In summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result.

shares of stock were traded In at the Stock Ex
change to-day, and the fluctuations in prices were
on & parity with the transactions. There was
little pres tare to sell, however, and the decline in
the first hour was the weakest, ranging from -/g to
3 1/ 8 per cent. Manhattan scored the greatest loss,
fa.ii: gto 9-Vs- "' lie ling of this specialty was
attributed to llquida ion of sales by an operator
recently arrayeu on the bail side of the stock.
Heading sold down to 20%, the lowest-point of the
week. Tbe proposed ruination of the com
pany's char ef by the Attorney-General of Penn
sylvania accounts for the decline. The losses in
the grangers, industrials, trunk lines and Western
Union were confined to exceedingly narrow
limit*
The bank statement was again favorable, but It
had no effect. The bunks are still maintaining

A FORTUNE FOR BREAKFAST
How de Mmsei, Moupon and Duprez
Suld a Sons;.
Some years ago three young men, all
highly gifted but improvident and un
fortunate, were walking the streets of
Paris together, penniless and hungry,
says Tit-Bits.
"What wouldn't I give for a nice break
fast?" said one of them.
"What wouldn't I give for a breakfast,
even if it weren't nice?" said another.
"Any kind of breakfast would do for
me, provided it was a breakfast!" said the
tbird.
"How much must we have with which
to gÂ«-t our meal?" asked the first.
"We ought to have 10 francs at least."
said another.
"I have an idea! Here's a music pub
lisher. Come along !" said one.
"Sir," said he to the publisher, "we wish
to sell you a song of which one of us has
written the words and another the air;
and I will sing it, as I am the only one 01
the three who has any voice."
The music pubii-her made a grinmce.
"Well, go on. We'll see if your song is
good for anything."
â¢'Hum!" said the publisher at the con
chiston of the performance, "it isn't
much of a song â a simple little thing.
But I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll give
you 15 franca for it."
The time young men had not expected
as much. They nanded the publisher the
manuscript, took tbe money and went off
to dine at a neighboring restaurant. The
author of the words was Alfred de Musset,
the composer Hippolite Moupon and the
singer Gilbert Duprez. The song, which
was entitled "Connaissez-vousdans Barce
lone?" had a great popularity and brought
the publisher a considerable fortune.
â¢ â â¦â â¢
About 600,000 trees are annually planted
by Swedish school children under the guid
ance of their teachers.

HOW JOSHUA HENDY
SPELLED "FIFTH"
Important Bearing on the
Meaning of a Be
quest.
Somewhat Sensational Episode
in a Hitherto Dull Will
Case.
It Seems Probable That Charles
Manner Will Gat Only $10,000
From the Estate.
Thee was a sensational surprise in the
Joshua Heady will case in Judjre Coffey's
court late yesterday afternoon. This trial,
with its many side issues, has been
dragging its slow length along for so
many weary years that anything like a
novelty is hailed with delight by the at
torneys and the court, and therefore yes
terday's happenings were joyfully wel
comed by both sides to tiie controversy.
For some time argument has been going
on in order to convince Judge Coffey as to
the proper way to construe one provision
of the will, which read that the testator
bequeathed to Charles Manner "one-fif
teth" of Ms stock in the Hendy Machine
Works.
Attorney Baggett contended th?.t the
testator intended to leave "one-fifth" of
his machine works stock to Charles Man
ner, while those representing the otlier
heirs thongut it ought to read "one-tif
tieth."
As the stock is worth something like
half a million dollars, it makes quite a
difference to Mr. Manner. One-fifth
would be $100,000, while one-fiftieth would
amount to only $10,000.
Mr. Baggett said there was nothing on
the face of the wili to show me exact
meaning ot the testator, but he thoueht
that in any event the court would not be
justified in interpreting the word as
â¢â fiftieth" ; tha.tat most it could be consid
ered as a b)ank for the present, and read a
decision to show that in a similar casein
England the question of fact was referred
to a jury for determination.
Attorneys E. B. Young and W. H. H.
H.irt on behalf of the executors of the
will urged that it was not reasonable to
suppose Mr. Hendy intended to bestow
$100, 000 on Mr. Manner, who was a stranger
io his blood, but that it was quite within
the bounds of reason to think he might
give nim property worth $10,000, that be
ing equal to $1000 a year for the time Mr.
Manner was in testator's employment.
This view was apparently accepted as
sound and just by Mr. Manner, for he
made no contest on the point, the present
condition being urged by Mr. Baggett on
behalf of Mrs. Rough, another of the
heirs.^whose interests areaep-ndenton the
way in which the will is construed.
During the trial of the caie frequent re
grets were expressed by the lawyers and
the courts that no letters or writings by
Joshua Hendy containing the words
â¦â¢fifth" or "fiftieth" bad been produced,
HALE BROS. I
and it was in this relation that the sur
prise of yesterday occurred.
After Mr. Baggett had concluded his
argument in favor of having the word
"fifteth" construed to mean "fifth," Mr.
Young announced that he had a docu
ment to present for the scrutiny which he
thought would have great weight in ar
riving at a just conclusion. He thereupon
read a letter written by Joshua Hendy to
his brother Samuel Hendy, in which he
spoke of a company in which he was
largely interested, that he "owned one
fifth of the stock and ought to have some
voice in the management of the corpora
tion."
Briefly arguing the point, Mr. Young
said that this showed that Joshua Hendy
knew how to spell "fifth" and that when
he wrote "fifteth" he meant "fiftieth 1 ' and
not "fifth."
Mr. Baggett was at once greatly inter
ested in the important epistle. Judge
Coffey also evinced a desire to scrutinize
it, and it was quickly passed from Hand to
band.
Curiosity was immediately aroused, and
the question arose as to wbereitha t letter
came from. It had never appeared in the
case before. That it was genuine no one
for a moment doubled, for it may be
safely said that nobody could successfully
counterfeit the late Joshua Hendy's chi
rography. It is something unique and
altogether unapproachable in its eccen
tric characteristics. It must be seen to
be appreciated.
Mr. Young was called to the witness
stand and told the story of the way in
which he obtained the letter. He said
that on Thursday last he called on Attor
ney Charles S. Wheeler of the firm of
Bishop & Wheeler for the purpose of ob
tainine certain letters written by Joshua
Hendy and now the property of his client,
Mrs. McGurn. In talking witbMr.Wheeler
be learned that some of the late Joshua
Hendy's letters to his brother Samuel had
been returned from Mexico after the close
of the will contest and that this ietter,
containing the word "fifth," was among
them.
Mr. Baggett asked for time in which to
examine an the letters that bad been re
turned from Mexico, and was given a con
tinuance of the case until next Wednes
day for that purpose.
After tne adjournment of court Mr.
Baggett said he was forced to admit that
the newly discovered letter had great
weight in settling the disputed point,
though he insisted that it was not con
clusive. It proved that Joshua Hendy
knew how to spell "fifth" in 1882, which
was six years before the writing of the
will â that much be conceded â but he
would go through the other letters with a
microscope to <>cc if he had not also
spelled "fifth" as it was written in the
will.
Messrs. Hart and Young and their
clients, the Hendys and Mrs. McGurn, on
the other hand were openly exultant.
Tney declared that the proper spelling of
fifth in the letter of 1882 knocked out all
chance for construing "fifteth" to mean
"fifth."
Judge Coffey said he hoped that be
might be able to reach a conclusion next
Wednesday.

Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper and Her

Services Will Be Held in the First

The funeral services over Mrs. Sarah B.
Cooper and her unfortunate daughter,
Harriet, will be held at the First Congre
gational Church on Monday at 12 o'clock.
Rev. Dr. Adams, the pastor, and Rev. Dr.
McLean of the Pacific Theological Semin
ary will have charge.
Arrangements for the funeral were not
periected until yesterday because the
friends here awaited instructions from the
relations East. There bad been hopes
that the dead mother's sister, Mrs. Skilton
of Brooklyn, N. V., might come to this
City at once, but she was so completely
prostrated by the news that she cannot
come.
The folio wine telegrams from Mrs. Skil
ton and her husband afford the instruc
tions on which the friends here are con
| ducting the iuneral:
New York, Dec. 12, 1890.
Mmes. Gaden and Hale, 1902 Valtejo street, San
Francwcoâ Overwhelmed with grief. 1 send
earnest thanks for all kindness, begging you
to act for me in all things. Bury beside Mr.
Cooper. Will go us quickly as possible.
Mrs. Harriet E. Skilton.
Mmc*. Gaden, and Barnelt, 1002 Vallejo street,
San iranciÂ»co â Mrs. Skilton prostrate with
grief. Ail relatives send gratelul acknowledg
ments of the many kindnesses of San Fran
cisco's loving friends and confirm Mrs. Skil
ton's telegram to Mmes. Gaden md Hale.
Jdlius A. Skilton.
Following the spirit of these telegrams,
arrangements for the funeral were com
pleted at once. In spite of the fact that
Mrs. Cooper always abhorred public
funerals, it was decided that hers and her
daughter's be such, because of the thou
sands who want to pay their tribute of
love to the beloved dead, because the life
worlc of Mrs. Cooper was devoted to the
public and because the residence is too
small a place for the accommodation of
any large number of the friends of the
dead.
There will be no funeral services at the
bouse, though a few invitations will be
sent to intimate friends who desire to look
upon the faces of mother and daughter.
The coifins will not be opened at the
church, however, in deference to Mrs.
Cooper's dislike of such publicity. The
interment will be in Laurel Hill Ceme
tery, where the husband and father is
buried.
The Coroner's jury was taken to the
residence by Deputy Coroner Hallet yes
terday morning, where the remains were
viewed and the premises inspected. The
following composed the jury: C. J. Mc-
Neill, 300 Post street; E. F. Zahler, 336

Post street; G. R. Kibbe. 316 Post street;
A. J. Wash burn, 324 Post street; N. C.
Hulse, 328 Post street; H. F. Flynn, 338
Post street; William Reed, 344 Post street ;
Adolph Block, 211 Post street; M. Fried
man, 228 Stockton street.
There were scores of carriages in^the
vicinity, hundreds of distinguished friends
calling to pny their respects and to off er
their services to those in charge. The
services of two special police were required
at the house during the day to keep the
visiting throng in order.
It is learned that the estate left by Mrs.
Cooper will amount to $16,000 or $18,000.
It consists of the borne at 1902 Vallejo
street, a lot in Santa Barbara and one in
Alameda. The homestead is worth about
$7000.
Most of the societies of which Mrs.
Cooper was a leading spirit called special
meetings yesterday morning and adopted
resolutions of respect.
The Century Club held a meeting yes
terday afternoon and passed resolutions
concerning the untimely death of the
women who were so well known by the
members of tbe club. The board of di
rectors of the Kindergarten Association
met yesterday morning at the call of Mrs.
Pierce, vice-president. Many representa
tives of Mrs. Cooper's Bible class were
present.
Mrs. John T. Swift and Mrs. Cornwall
stated that they would prepare an appro
priate memorial for the Century Club.
Mrs. Sargent and Mrs. Oulton of tne State
Women's Suffrage Committee offered their
condolence, and scores of representatives
of prominent societies were present on
similar missions.
The iuneral will probably be one o! the
largest ever seen in San Francisco. A
notable feature will be the great attenu
ance of children from the kindergartens
and children from other schools.
Many of these were formerly in kinder
gartens and came in contact with Mrs.
Cooper and her daughter.
There is now no suspicion in the mind
of any one at all familiar with the facts
that Mrs. Cooper was in any way a party
to the tragedy. Her death was due to
over-confidence in her insane daughier,
whom she loved so devotedly that she
could not bear to be separated from her
for a day. __^___________
DIPHTHERIA CASES.
The Value of Sterilized Swabs Demon
strated by Dr. (Spencer of tho
Health Board.
The practical value of the sterilized
swabs which the Board of Health has
been distributing about town for use in
diphtheria cases was demonstrated on Fri
day. These swabs were used on the
throats of two patients whose cases were
reported on Thursday, and the secretions
examined by Dr. Spencer, the board's
bacteriologist.
In both instances the bacilli of diph
theria were discovered. In future all
cases reported will be verified in this man
ner and precautions taken accordingly.
The board has distributed literature re
lating to diphtheria about the City in ad
dition to the swabs aud will try to edu
cate the people in the proper methods of
detecting as well as preventing the dis
ease.
Two new cases of diphtheria were re
ported at the Health Office on Friday, one
being at 52 Jessie street and the other at
641 a Natoma street.
A Football Trophy.
Tne Pacific Amateur Athletic Association
held a meeting Friday night in Olympic Club
building and decided to appoint a committee
of four to purchase a trophy for the football
contest. The committee are Messrs. Sheehan,
Rhinehart, Berry and David Brown. The
Olympics and the Stanfords will claim tho
trophy, and the committee will no doubt
make the award to the first named, tney
having tied the Stanfords aud the latter hav
ing declined to meet the Olympics aud play
off the tie.

THE CORNER GAS
LAMPS MUST GO
How the City Byways Are
Coming Into the
Light.
Market Street Will Next Array
Herself in Lines of
Arc Lamps.
Howard, Taylor, Kearny and Mont
gomery and Others Will Go
to Electricity.
The work of lighting up the dark by
ways of this City goes splendidly ahead,
and one street after another where a few
gas lamps twinkled dirtily through the
fog and gloom is being strung with electric
lamps. Polk street led the way, and the
setting of arc lights there encouraged Fol
som. Sixth and several others to emerge
from the dusk. Then Valencia streetâ
that great thoroughfare that divides the
Mission into the eastern and western
halves â called for light, and quickly there
â will be an illumination along tnat drive
way. Kearny, Montgomery, Fillmore and
Lartin will come next, as the people
along those streets have signified their in
tention to make the change.
The lighting of the other streets of the
City is rapidly progressing. The Mer- ]
chants' Association gave orders yesterday
for twelve arc lights on Ninth street from
Market to Howard, and six arc lights on
Taylor street irom Golden Gate avenue to
Eddy. Applications are coming in from
every part of the City for additional illu
mination. The Merchanis' Association is
willing to co-operate with the residents in
any part of the City for the better lighting
of tne streets. It believes that when once
the City is properly illuminated the City
authorities will appreciate the wisdom and
necessity of relieving the property-owners
and merchanis from this expense and
hereafter keep up the illumination of the
streets at the expense of the municipality.
This was the plan adopted by the Mer
chants' Association in securing the clean
ing and sweeping of the streets. It started
the experiment by soliciting subscriptions
for the work. The City, subsequently
realizing the great advantage of clean
streets, has continued the work.
The Merchants' Association is now con
sidering the advisability of interesting
the property-owners and tenants alont.
Market street irom ths ferry to Valencia
street in the better illumination of that
thoroughfara. A number of the larger
property-owners will be canvassed with a
view of ascertaining their wishes in the
matter and how far they will go in con
tributing for the iighting of that street.
If sufficient subscriptions are contributed
for the purpose a string of electric lights
will be installed on each side of Market
street with a large number of colored arc
lights in the middle of the thoroughfnre.
This will make a very impressive spec
tacle and will greatly improve the appear
ance of the street at night. The Mer
chants' Association is now ready to re
| HALE BROS. !
ceive suggestions from all citizens upon
this improvement.
From inquiry along tbis great thorough
fare it is learned that there is a general
desire on the part of the property-owners
and people doing buiiness there to have
the strett aglow its full length. On the
basis of a tax of $1 apiece per month,
which the Sixth-street people are paying,
the people doing business there can have
what they wish in the way of illumina
tion, and no doubt the last corner gas
lamp will soon flicker out for all time on
Market street.
FORGER, BUT POLITE.
Bsnaom Ellenwood Seutenced to San
Quentin for Fourteen Years.
Ransom Ellenwood, the dashins ex
navy officer, smiled courteously to Judge
Wallace and the officers of the court as he
stood up on .Friday morning to hear his
sentence for passing a fictitious check for
|100 on Mr. Doolittle, proprietor cf the St.
Nicholas Hotel.
In consideration of Ellenwood's dis
tinguished appearance and because he has
shown no disposition to escape he was
spared the indignity of being chained to
the other prisoners and was permitted to
stand outside tbe dock.
Ellenwood was consigned to San Quen
tin for fourteen years and at once went
below with an officer, bowing politely to
his Honor and to the court attendants as
he went.
