THE SWINDLE IS REVEALED
Billy Smith Tells How Bob
Fitzsimmons Was
Robbed.
REFEREE TO DECIDE THE
FOUL ON THE FIRST,
.Sharkey, Lynch, Gibbs and Groom
' Constituted the National Club

HIRAM COOK COULD NOT BE USED
AND WAS REJECTED.
"The Call's" Stand on the Fight Fully Supported
and Justified by the Testimony Given in
Judge Sanderson's Court Yesterday
by Sharkey's Trainer.
The sensation of the hour is the testi-
nio.ny of Billy Smith in Judge Sanderson's
court yesterday wherein he laid bare the
. conspiracy to rob Fitzsimmons and the
vublic by an agreement with Long Green
Lawrence's bodyguard, who was to re
ceive $2500 for deciding the fight in favor
of Sharkey on a foul.
George Allen, who assisted Smith in
training Sharkey, will testify to the same
effect this morning.
Wiiliam Abbott will also app-ar and
corroborate Smith's testimony.
The stand that The Call took on the
fiasco of a week apo is being borne out in
every uaai;, andeach day ihe corro?>ora
t'o.n prew stronger until yesterday, when
the whole disgraceful business was ex-
'1 to the people who had been so
r shamefully duped. It needs but the repro
duction of The Call's story of last Thurs
day morning to describe the affair as the
testimony of the last seven days has finally
made it.
It would be supe Huous to say that the
courtroom was crowded.
When a big auditorium like that of the
Mechanics' Pavilion can be packed with
people who pay from $5 to $10 each to
witness a prize-fight, is it any wonder that
a small courtroom should be crowded
when Bob Fitzsimmcns was on exhibition
without any admission fee?
Judge Sanderson was as grim and as
dignified as usual, but he relaxed suffi
ciently to allow every available inch cf
standing room to be crowded with a dense
.mass of spectators.
When the court opened at 10 o'clock
neither the principals nor their attorneys
were present. The tawny mustache and
light-blue eyes of Wyatt Earp were con-
spicuously not to the fore, and there was
a groan of disappointment when Judge
Sanderson, after asking whether there
were any other matters to be disposed of
except those on the calendar, announced
that he would proceed with another case.
It was after 11 o'clock before General
"YV. 'H. L. Barnes, grizzled, plump, rosy
and debonnair, pushed his way through
the crowd and stood up against the inner
rail which fences the clerk of the court
away from the populace. Shortly after
'". "ward ex-Lieutenant- Colonel Kowalsky
â¢and Lawyer Friedenrich made their ap
pearance behind the general and waited
lor a pause in tbe proceedings.
Fitzbitamons and Julian came in late,
and their entry was the signal for much
f whispering and confusion. The court
i room both inside and outside the build
ing being crowded, the tall prize-fighter
â had to wedge his way through the mats of
men to the table at which the attorneys
'" were standing. Julian followed easily in
â¢the'wake left by the big fellow, foi Fitz
siinmons' shoulders are broad and square.
"There he is," taid spectator after
tpeciator.
â¢'Who? Where?"
"i- itzsimmons. That tall, red-headed
fellow with the ba.'d forehead.'
Fi;z was refp'.endently arrayed. His
Pritrce Albert coat displayed the sheen of
silk on the lapels. His colored shirt was
of the new moire antique water-mark
â¢ pattern, and on that breast so often
thumped by tbe calloused lists of pugilistic
antagonists there flashed a stone of great
price. He carried his silk hat in his left
hand, purchased from Groom in the early,
happy days of confi ience, before the long
green i^hadow fell across his pathway.
When the pause in the proceedings
came, the lawyers informed the Judge
that they were ready in the Fitz immons-
. v k:irkey case, and by consent the matter
was put off until 2 r. m.
William G. Smith, otherwise known as
"Billy Smith of Australia," was called to
the witnei-s-stand in the afternoon by
Fitzsimmons' coun.-el, who began by ask
ing certain questions, the answers to which
tended to establish t: c good reputation of
tnÂ« witness as an industrious workingman.
Â» BiUy Smith's testimony was unique.
jHe revealed in an utiv.irnished, ctraight
l'orward way most ot the details of the
Vcfarious conspiracy by which not only
Fitzsimmons but thousands of persons in
terested in the manly art were swindled
of their bets.
The courtroom hung in breathless sui
pense upon every word uttered by the wit
.less,'and as he deliberately unfolded the
details of the plot originated by tiharkey
The San Francisco Call.
and Lynch there were heard loud mur
murs from the indignant spectators when
they found that their suspicions were ail
too true.
Smith said that he was 28 years of age,
i a blacksmith by occupation, and that he
j had resided in this City for a little more
I than seven years. During that time he
had worked at his trade in several foun
dries and iron works in this City.
Smith went on to tell- how he had acted
jas Snarkey's trainer at the Seal Kock
j House on the ocean beach, with George
Allen as his assistant, and during tbe live
â  days before tbe fight Danny Needham
j carme in and helped.
On one of his walks with Sharkey about
three weeks before the fight, Sharkey re
quested him to look up some people from
| among whom a suitable referee could be
chosen. On that afternoon Hiram Cook
came out to the training quarters, and
Smith believing that he would be a fair
referee spoke to him about it. Cook ex
pressed his willingness to serve, Smith
mentioned the matter to Sharkey and ex
pressed the opinion that Cook would give
"a good square decision." Sharkey re
plied that he would think a little about
the matter.
The next time Dan Lynch, Sharkey's
manager, came out Sharkey spoke about
Cook and gave Lynch his address. Lynch
asked Smith whether he was sufficiently
intimate with Cook to "talk business"
with him, and Smith's answer was that
he knew Cook pretty well, but not well
enough for that. Lynch thereupon an
nounced his intention of seeing Cook at
once.
In a day or two afterward Lynch came
back and reported that he had seen Cook
and that Cook would not do. Lynch had a
talk with Sharkey and after he went away
Sharkey told Smith that Cook was "no
good" aud that he didn't want him to
referee the fight.
He said that Lynch asked Cook how he
would decide a finht between Cook's
brother and a Chinaman. Cook replied
that if the Cbinaman won, he would de
cide in favor of the Chinaman. This
statement disgusted both Lynch and
Sharkey, and Sharkey said to the witness
in the complimentary vernacular of the
png, "We don't want that to be
referee for us."
It seemed, according to the witness, that
whenever anybody was mentioned by the
pugilistic circle of which he was a mem
ber, the absentee was spoken of as a man
with a bar sinister across his escutcheon.
Sharkey told Smith on another occasion
that he (Sharkey), Lynch, Gibbs and
Groom composed the National Club, and
that he (Sharkey) was to get 20 per cent of
the proceeds of the fight after the $10,000
purse had been taken out.
Sbarkey said also that Gibbs, Groom
and Fitzsiraruons had no money, and that
he (Sharkey) was the only man who had
any capital, and that be had to deposit
|2500 for F.tz-iimmons and $2500 for him
self to guarantee their appearance in the
ring, and that that had lied up so much of
his money that he was nearly "broke."
About ten days before the fight the mat
ter of the selection of a referee was brought
up again, when Sharkey informed Smith
that a "racehorse man" named Wyatt
Earp would make a very good reieree, and
that he would be "all rirrht." Sharkey
added that there would be good money in
it for the referee â that it would be worth
$2500 to the referee. He said further that
he and Ins friends intended to object to
every referee proposed by the other side,
and if they didn't agree upon a referee by
12 o'clock noon ol" the day of the fight the
ciub would choose the referee that Sharkey
and Lynch wanted.
At about 10 o'clock in the forenoon of
the day of the fight Sharkey told Smith
tiat they had the referee they wanted and
that Fitzsiramons would lose on a foul in
the first round â that it had been agreed
that Earp was to give him the fight on a
foul. The first bJow that Fitz would de
liver on Sharkey's body would be the
signal for Danny Needham to jump into
the ring and claim a foul.
When Sharkey and Fitzsimmons ap
peared in the ring on the evening of the
tight Sharkey's hands were bandaeed in
order to strengthen them and save them
from accident. Fitzsimmons objected to
the bandages and Sharkey refused to take

them off until Wyatt Earp walked over to
Needham and whispered, "TaKe off the
bandages; it will be all right, anyhow."
At the end of the second round Shaikey
was considerably dazed from the effects of
the punches on the head administered by
Fitzsimmon?, and he was very anxious to
know what round it was.
When Sharkey was knocked flat in the
eighth round Smith carried him to his
corner and Lynch came up and whispered,
"Now. Tom, keep your hands down and !
pretend to be in great pain." Sharkey re- I
plied that that was all right, but he!
seemed to be dazed and didn't know what
he was doing and he forgot to put his
hands down, but kept them on his head
and over his ears, where he said he had
pains.
They picked up Sbarkey bodily and car
ried Dim to the dressing- room, from
which, by orders of Lynch, everybody was
excluded. Lynch would not allow any
doctors or reporters to see him, nor would
he permit Smith to take off Sharkey's
trunks. For the period of an hour Shar
key lay there complaining of pains in his
ear and head, and at the end of that time
he was taken, to the Windsor Hotel in a
hack. In his room Smith stripped Shar
key, and saw no injury or discoloration
whatever, nor did Sharkey complain of
any injury elsewhere than on bis Head.
After a while a man calling himself Dr.
B. B. Lee visited Sharkey and for about a
quarter of an hour Smith and Allen were
excluded from the room, and they heard
Sharkey shrieking and howling with pain,
as though the doctor was hurting him.
When they were again admitted to Shar
key's room several leeches were feasting
on his swollen ear and Smith saw that the
doctor had bandaged Sharkey's body.
Sharkey called the witness to his bedside
and asked him as to what kind of a fight
he had put up, and on being assured by
Smith that he did pretty well, Sharkey
replied: "That fellow can beat Corbett
in two rounds. He hits like a kick from a
mule."
A day or so before the fight the witness
was boxing with Sharkey and struck
Sharkey a severe blow on the ear, causing
it to begin to swell. Fitz finished the job.
and at the end of the fight Sharkey had
what is known in the pugilistic vernacular
as a cauliflower ear. As soon as the peo
ple left the room Sharkey jumped briskly
out of bed, lighted a cigar at the gas jet
and walk d up and down the room smok
ing it. He did not walk at all lame and
showed no symptoms of having been in
jured in the least.
After Dr. Lee lett there was a small bot
tle of iodide of potassium on the wash
stand. There were no stains on Sharkey's
head or ears to show that the drug had
been used as a liniment.
No other physician except Dr. Lee was
allowed to attend him, but the witness
could not say who it was that called him.
Going back to the fight the witness said
that he and the other man who carried
Sharkey from the ring into the dressing
room had a hard job of it, Sharkey being
a heavy man, and the}' had to double him
up in all kinds of ways in order to carry
him, but he never complained of any pain
by reason of the rough manner in which
he was being handled.
Sharkey told the witness one day that
Lynch got one-third of tbe receipts for
managing the fight Referee Earp came I
ud to Sharkey's room between 12 and 3 in I

THE ENEMIES THEY HAVE MADE.
the mornine. Earp stood and looked at I
Smith and'said: "Hello, Sbarkey, how
do you feel?" Smith said: "I'm not
Sharkey. He's in bed. 1 ' Then Earp went
into the bedroom and had a talk with
Sharkey for about fifteen minutes.
The witness did not see any towel
thrown into the air after Sharkey's knock
down and he did not claim a fo'.il.
General Barnes began bis cross-exam
ination by inquiring as to .where Smith
had worked at his trade in this State, and
Smith replied that he had worked at the
Risdon and the Fulton iron works and in
Eastwood's foundry. He had fought
about a dozen prize-fights in this City and
had acted as a trainer for several pugilists.
The witness explained that he was a
citizen of this country and had no present
intention of leaving the State. Ho aid
not make any arrangements with Sharkey
as to what his compensation shouli be.
Trainers always leave that to the fighter,
and it is usually $100 on every $1000 of the
purse. His board and lodging during the
I time of his services were paid by Sliarkey.
Last Saturday Lynch paid him $100
on account of his services and saiii that If
he would call around on Monday he
would be paid the rest. The witness
called, but was unable to see Lynch. He
considered that Sharkc> owed him $1000.
O:i the eveninir of tht .".jght Smith lust a
friend named George Harding, who in
formed him that he had bet some money
on Fitzsimmons. Harding wanted to
know Smith's opinion of the matter, and
the witness told him that he thougnt it
was. a "rob"; that he, Smith, was on
Sharkey's side and that he thought of
coming out and telling the truth about
the matter. On last Monday evening
I Smit'i went with Harding to the rooms of
j Colonel Kowalsky in the Baldwin Hotel
'and made a statement of all the facts to
him.
Smith had trained Sharkey twee before,
once in Vallejo and once in San Mateo.
"Did you co to the fight with the under
standing that it was to be settled that
way?" asked Mr. Barnes.
The witness said that he didn't meddle
with it. He kept his fingers out of it as
much as he could.
"Didn't you tell Sharkey that that was
a good scheme?"
"No, sir."
"You didn't say it was a rascally scheme
to get thousands of people to pay $5 and
$10 to see a tight of that kind ?"
The implied reproof was lost on the wit
ness. He repeated his reply that it whs
no affair of his and that he did not meddle
with it.
In reply to further questions Smith said
that Sharkey told him twice on the after
noon of the fight that he, Sharkey, was
going out in the first round on a foul.
Sharkey did not tell him who it was that
had made the contract with Referee Earp.
He did not mention the name of Gibbs or
Groom in connection with that matter.
When the witness went to pick up
Sharkey he found Sharkey lying flat on
his back with his arms stretched out. He
did not have bis hands on his body at all.
He was not knocked out, but very nearly
soâ not unconscious as knocked out men
are, but conscious and very much dazed.
When they were carrying Sharkey out
of the ring the witness had Sharkey
around the waist and had all that he could
do to lift him. Sharkey did not try to
walk, but the witness believed that he
could walk if he wanted to. The only
place where Sharkey was hurt was about
the head. Sharkey told the witness that
Fitzsimmons could not hurt him about
the oody at all ; that Fitz had only two
good blows, and those were his right and
left hand swings.
"They seemed to answer the purpose
pretty well," commented Mr. Barnes.
George Allen was called to the stand and
was asked by the court whether he had
any intention of leaving the State. He re
plied that it had baen his intention'to
leave for Australia on to-day's steamer,
but thai he had changed his mind.
The court ordered Allen to be in court at
10 o'clock this morning.
SHARKEY WAS UNINJURED.
William Abbott Will Tell All He
Heard and Saw After the
Fight.
The swindlers in the Sharkey-Fitzsim
mons fight are on the run. Evidence
proving their conspiracy is piling in fast,
and there is every likelihood that the tes
timony will be so strong in the morning
when the case comes up again in court
that "Long Green" Lawrence and the
clique with him that beat the public will
throw up their hands and accept judg
ment.
Smith's evidence will be backed up in i
the morning by Allen, the other trainer of j
Sharkey, and on top of that will come the !
testimony of William Abbott.
The latter is thoroughly disinterested in
the matter, excepting that he wants to see ,
square sport.
He was at the ringside on the night of j
the brittle, and he put a tew dollars on the !
Hnarkey end simply because the odds
were alluring.
When Sharkey laid down and made
pretense of being injured Abbott was one
of the first to assist Lynch and Needham
to carry Sharkey through the crowd.
They eventually reached a side room in
the Pavilion, and there everybody else .
was excluded.
Abbott, however, got in with the clique
and continued one of the crowd evpn until
all went to the room in the Windsor !
Hotel. At the latter place Abbott's pres
ence was noticed and Danny Lynch asked
him to step out.
"During all the time I was with those
people," Abbott stated last night, "Shar- I
key was the same as I have ever seen him.
He did not appear to be in pain and he
complained of no foul, tie was badly
bruised and cut up about the face, aud that
alone seemed to worry him. He never
spoke of any wound or bruise below the j
belt. Anyhow, he acted like a man who i
was fully capable of walking about, jump
ing or doing anything else a healthy man J
could do.
"1 propose to do what I can to straighten
out this dilemma in behalf of square
sport. 1 don't know Fitzsimmons or the
other faction excepting as public charac
ters, and have no interest besides what I
hays said in this matter."
A HURRICANE TO ORDER.
How the Examiner Got One Up for
Pasadena When the P ople
Wouldn't Subscribe.
LOS ANGELES, Cal , Dec. 9.â Since
Mr. Hearst's peculiar style of journalism
is under review by the newspapers of Cali
fornia, it may not be amiss to describe
how that gentleman "gets even," not
only with individuals and corporations,
but with whole communities which may
have, in an unwitting hour, incurred his
displeasure. The town of Pasadena, as is
well known, is one of thf> most delightful
spots in all this splendid Southland. Its
peculiar situation as the crown of the val
ley, which its name signifies, has given it
a picturesqueness seldom found anywhere
on earth.
Its people are cultured, refined and re
spectable, and they do not like the Ex
aminer, nor for years has it been much of
a naperin the southern city.
In short, the Examiner was not wanted
by Pasadenans, and the fact was reported
to the "able management." That man
agement said, "We shall even up score
with puritanical Pasadena." And it did.
Shortly after the frosted canvassers quit
Pasadena an article appeared in the local
columns of the "Monarch," which for
spleen, calumny and baseness, is probably
witnout a parallel in the history of
respectable journalism in America.
Without a shadow of foundation in fact
this great "moral engine" related in
detail, accompanied with illustrations,
how a most disastrous hurricane had
swept over the fair city leaving almost un
heard of devastation in its wake. The
illustrations represented buildings, trees
and bridges in a state of complete collapse
or prostration.
Tbe inhabitants were dumfounded at
these inexcusable and inexplicable false
hoods. Letters by the score were sent to
the paper explaining the "error," under
the impression that the management bad
been imposed upon by some irresponsible
employe, but no explanation nor apology
was ever made. Then it began to dawn
upon the citizens that the whole out
rageous lie had been premeditated and
willful. Tbe management had "got even"
with Pasadena, that was aIL
WHAT IS LONG GREEN?
.The Term Explained by Cashier
Burns of tha United States
Sub-Treasury.
Cashier Thomas Burns of the United
States Sub-Treasury knows something
about "long green." "Green goods" men
have been the bane of his life. Wherever
i they ply their trade leaving a lot of dupes
behind, the latter send to the Sub-lreas
ury for relief, hoping to get back from the
I Government the money wheedled out of
them by the sharps who are "out for the
long green."
Burns was seated for luncheon yester
day in the Mint cafe. His vis-a-vis were
Ed Kdlb of the Olympic Club and Notary
Public Stanley. The latter two were anx
ious to know exactly what the expression
"long green" meant.
â¢'Long green," said Burns, "is as well
Known on this coast as is Colonel Ma
! zuma. In fact poor Eddie Farrell, now
i dead, has left both these terms behind
him as monuments to his memory, and
| they tower high above the other boii mots
he ever deliveied.
"Long green means a paper longer than
it is wide, and covered with cabalistic
signs indicating its financial value. In
other words, long green is generally un
derstood as greenbacks."
DEATH IN THE BUZZARD.
Eight Persons Perish During the Recent
Storm in South Dckotaâ Thousands
of Sheep Lost
CHAMBERLAIN. S. Dak., Dec. 9.â
Notwithstanding that more than a week
has passed since the recent blizzard, re
ports are coming in from remote portions
west of the Missouri Kiver, 80 or 100
miles from railroad points or telegraph
stations. It was believed that no loss
of life resulted from the storm in South
Dakota, but the belated reports from the
remote sections refened to show that six
and possibly eight persons perished in
this State. An unknown man and boy
were frozen to death on the Bellfourche
River. The bodies of two men known as
"Scotty" aud Bob Carson, who were em
ployed by John D. Hale of Tilford as
sheepherders, have been found since the
storm. Two white men became bewildered
within four miles of St. Mary's M.ssion
and are supposed to have been killed by
the storm. Probably the greatest losers
by the blizzards were the Lewis Bros.,
who owned a flock of 6030 sheep in the
western part of Nowlin County. They
not only lost 2000 sheep, but William
Lewis himself perished in the blizzard
and Dr. J. Kennedy, an employe, died the
following day from exposure.

Measure.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 9.âSen
ator Perkins said to The Call corre
spondent to-night that in his opinion the
Pacific roads refunding bill would pass at
this session of Congress. He is a mem
ber of the steering committee of the Sen
ate, and no one realizes better than he the
desperate efforts that are being made to
bring the bill up.
On the other hand Judge Maguire is full
of hope.
"I think it ought to be easy to defeat the
bill in the Senate," said he, "for the ap
propriation bills will occupy most all of
the time of the short session. This meas
ure will require a vast deal of discussion,"
continued Judge Maguire, with a signifi
cant twinkle in his eye, "and if its discus
s:on is prolonged, of course that is just bo
much time consumed."
"But no Senator would have the hardi
hood to block the passage of the regular
appropriation bills, would he?" Inquired
The Call correspondent.
"I don't know what any Senator intends
to do," replied the Congressman; "but if
I were a Senator I should insist that the
reportof the Pacific ItaiJ roads Committee
be read in its entirety for the information
of the Senate. After its reading I think
the bill would be defeated. 1 '
When it was suggested to Senator Per
kins to-night chat there would be very little
time in which to accomplish any legisla
tion at this session beyond the passage of
the regular appropriation bills and that
considerable time might be occupied in the
discussion of the refunding bill to the det
riment of the appropriation bills, he inti
mated that it would not be wise policy to
adopt filibustering tactics which would re
tard or endanger the passage of the regu
lar appropriation bills. Senator Perkins
is very earnest in his desire to defeat the
bill, but hesitates to use filibustering tac
tics. Senator White is engaged in the
trial of lawsuits at Los Angeles, and it was
said to-day by one of his friends that he
would probably not be here until after the
holiday recess.
It is the programme of the railroaders
to try and bring the bill up in the Senate
before Christmas. Chairman Powers of
the House committee said thai he had
asked Speaker Heed and other members of
the Rules Committee to bring in a special
order to bring up the bill in the House on
January 5, and that three days be allowed
for debate.
Congressman Bowers returned to Wash
ington to-day. His impression on the
funding bill's chances confirms The Call's
telegram of last night. He said:
"I think the funding bill will pass both
Houses of Congress. That's the way it
looks to me to-day. I have no doubt that
the Committee on Rules, to which coes
the resolution providing that the bill be
taken up lor consideration on Januajy 5
and three days' debate be given, will be
reported favorably and adopted.
"Some fear was expressed that the bill
would be taken up this week or next. I
do not think it will. There are many who
desire to speak on the bill. I may not get
time, but I am on record, and have been
heard by the committee on this bill and
by tbe House on the ReiJly bill. My
opinion remains the same. My minority
report on the bill is wholly impersonal. I
look at it only from the point of public
policy.
"I think tbe passage of the bill will
make the fact potent that corporations are
to have greater considerations and be ac
corded privileges denied the individual by
the Government and courts. The individ
ual debtor is proceeded against by the
United States and stripped of everything
he has without mercy, while in the case of
these powerful corporations the Govern
ment hesitates to enforce the Jaw and pro
poses a relief never extended to the small
creditor, it's a bad lesson to eive the
people of the United States. That the
passage of the bill will insure tbe con
tinuance of a crievous monopoly upon the
people of the Pacific Coast is a matter that
a great majority of the East know or seem
to care little about. I shall vote against
the bill and speak against it, if I am ac
corded an opportunity.
"What a commentary it would be upon
the intelligence, tbe patriotism and sense
of justice of the Congress that should pass
and the executive that should approve
this so-called funding bill, which practi
cally makes a present from the United
States treasury of $100,000,000, and re
fuses to consider or pa&s or approve a bill
appropriating an equal sum lor the con
struction of the Nicaragua canal, which
will allow the people of the eastern and
western parts of this country to trade with
each other, and which would result in a
saving to the people of the United States
of more than its real cost each year.
"I would like to get my bill (which is
on the calendar) or any bill through to
settle upon just terms the matter of the
ownership of patented lands within the
public reservations, and I shall use every
effort to secure the passage of the mineral
land bill.
"How did I come to be beaten when my2
election was considered certain? Well,
when fusion was accomplished by the
Democratic and Populist committee,

bauchery, fraud and violation of law ever
known in California, I had to lace an ad

candidate procured (or some one procured
to: him) the indorsement of t he American
Protective Association. And as the Cath

they worked a 'double ruff' on me. Then
to finish the business a local judgeship

400 votes.

JACKSON'S BIRTHDAY.
Bryan Will .V<i/.-c . tco Speeches in Honor
of tflr J-.rcnt.
LINCOLN, Nebr., Dec. 9.â Hon. Wil
liam Jennings Bryan will make two Jack
son birthday banquet speeches. This was
the compromise arrived at this evening
after two delegationsâ one from Omaha,
the other from Chicago â had labored with
the silver champion throughout the after
noon to induce him to be the guest of
honor at their respective celebrations on
the evening of January 8. The Omaha
committee was the first on hand early this
mornine, and when Messrs. Burke and
Martin of the Cook County Democratic
Club arrived in the afternoon they found
prospects of having a fruitless trip. They
thereupon decided to change the date of
the Chicago banquet to the evening of
Wednesday. January 7, and with t..is ar
rangement Mr. Bryan accepted the invi
tation. After speaking at Chicago on that
date he will leave on an early morning
westbound train, reaching Omaha in time
f\r an address on the evening of the Bt!i.
It is intimated iiere t at in his Chicago
odd^ers Mr. Bryan may maKe ftis first
comment on Cleveland's me-sape to Con
gress. To the United Associated Presses
this evening he insisted that he had noth
ing to tay concern ng the document at
present, and probably would not have
unless he concluded to refer to it in some
public address.

Senator Peffer's Tariff Views.
TOPEKA, Kax., Dec. 9. -Senator Peffer.
who is a candidate for re-election, has
announced his tariff views. He says that
until the effects of the gold standard
policy began to show themselves in fall
ing prices he had believed in the Jack-
Bonian theory ot protection, but the sharp
competition, the American farmers have
to meet in foreign markets and the deadly
rivalry of foreign labor in our own coun
try have put a new face on things and
brougnt new questions to the front. If the
gold standard is to be permanently es
ubished he would favor free trade in
ereryihing except in articles used only
by the wealthy and the profligate.

CUBA'S FRIENDS
IN THE SENATE
Important Joint Resolutions
in Behalf of Inde
pendence.
Cameron, Mills and Call Are
Desirous of Ending the
Carnage.
Allen of N braska Creates a Commo
tion by Moving to Take Up
tbe Dingley Bill.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 9.â The
session of the Senate to-day was attended
by several interesting and important inci
dents. A joint resolution to continue the
powers of the joint committee on the re
moval of the taxes on alcohol used in the
manulactures and the arts was reported
this afternoon and passed.
The Committee on Interstate Commerce
was instructed to institute an inquiry as
to the prevention of business competition
by the Joint Traffic Association of Rail
roads, the ftaur millers and the window
glass manufacturers.
The independence of Cuba was the sub
ject o; three joint resolutions, introduced
by Cameron (11.) of Pennsylvania, Mills
(D.) of Texas and Call (D.) of Florida.
The first acknowledges the independence
ofthe island and directs the friendly offi
ces of the United States Government with
Spain to bring the war to a close.. The
second directs the Presidentof the United
States to take possession of the island
with the military and naval forces of the
United States and to hold possession until
the Cuban people can organize a govern
ment, and the third recognizes the repub
lic of Cuba as a free and independent Gov
ernment, and extends to it all rights in
the ports and wituin the jurisdiction of
the United States.
The first two were referred to the Com
mittt-e on Foreign Relations and the last
was la?d on the table temporarily, until
such time as Call may desire to address
the Senate on the subject.
Something of a political sensation was
produced by a mption made by the Popu
list Senatoj from Nebraska, A!len, to take
up the Dinpley bill for action, so as, he
said, to preclude the necessity for an extra
session. At first objection was made by
Mr. Aldrich (R.) ot Rhode Jbland. but
aiier a few minutes' reflection Aldrich
withdrew the objection, which was there
upon renewed by P.tinipr (D.) of Illinois.
Allen (Pop.) of Nebraska asked unani
mous consent to have the Dingley bill
taken up for consideration. Objection
was made by Aldnch(R.)of Rhode Island
in the phrase "Let it ko over."
Allen moved that the bill be taken up
notwilnstanding the objection.
"Let the biil be read," said Platt, "so
that the Senate may know what it is
voiing upon." The bill was thereupon rend
in full, with the free-silver substitute re
ported for it last session from the Finance
Committee.
After the reading Aldrich withdrew his
objection to taking up the bill, and the ob
jection was renewed by Palmer (D.) of
Illinois. Allen desired to make a brief
statement, but objection was made, and
the Senate proceeded to vote by ayes and
noes on the motion to taKe up the biil.
The vote in detail was as follows:
Ayes â A'drieh, Allen. Butier, Cameron,
Chandler, Clark, Davis, Elkins, Krye, Gallinser,
Gear, Gordon, Hale, HansbrouKli, Hoar, Kvle-
Lodge, McMillan, Mitchell of Oregon, Morgan,
Morrill, Murphy, Nelson, I'etfer, Perkins, Petti,
grew. Platt, PriicharJ, Pugh, Quay, Roach 1
Sherman. Smith, Stewart, WoJcottâ 3s.
Noesâ Baker, Blackburn. Blmichard, Can
non, Carter, Dubois, Faulkner, Gibson,
Gorman, Harris, Hill, Jones of Arkansas, Mar
tin, Mills, Palmer, Pasco, Tu*pie, Vest, Wal
thaliâ 21.
The bill having been taken up Aldrich
(R ) moved that the bill be recommitted
to the Committee on Finance, witu in
struclions to report it back without
amendment.
Alien opposed the motion.
The Senate at once plunged into a de
bate of prospective interminable length.
Alien (Pop.) of Nebraska, chairman of the
Populist convention, held the floor. He
was subjected to a sharp fusillade of ques
tions by Senators Aldrich (R.) of Rhode
Island, Hale (R.) of Maine and others as
to when he would permit a vole to be
taken. All these he parried adroittly.
He yielded the floor temporarily to Harris
(D.) of Tennessee, who moved to amend
the resolution to recommit the bill by
striking out the instructions.
Aldrich promptly replied. "I accept that
amendment," and the debate went on.
At 2 o'clock the Dingley bill, at the ex
piration of the morning hour, went over
until to-morrow.
SANKING AND CURENCY.

bif the House Committee.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 9.â The

rency at its meeting to-day unanimously

SENSATIONAL DRAMA.
Actors at ihe Criterion Theater, Chicago,
Assum? Heavy Rr.les Against a
Constable and His Writ.
CHICAGO, 111., Dec. 9.â A1l the actors
at the Criterion Theater assumed heavy
rolls yesterday morning when Constable
,MurhiÂ£g appeared at the door with a writ
of attachment. Before the constable said
a word every actor in the place seized a
chair, an empty bottle or apiece of gas
pipe. Then they made a movement in the
direction of the constable, which ended
when the officer was lyin^' on the sidewalk
with a sensitive bump on his head.
With professional instinct the artists
interpreted tbe motive of the constable
with the attachment writ in his pocket.
It is the same as when an ice wason runs
over a bicycle rider; the wheelman can
tell the wagon is loaded with ice without
asking the driver. It wus this sort of
mental acumen so highly developed in
the ranks of Thespians tha: brought
Constable Murhkg to a condition entirely
out ot the comnat before he had an op
portunity to serve the writ. When the
constable recovered partially he sum
moned five more constables to his aid
and went back to the theater, which is
situated at Sedgwick ami Division streets,
and secured possession of the premises.
The writ was issued at the instigation
of Nilson Bros., plumbers, who recently
refitted th^ house. Tue Swedish-American
opera company intended to give a per
formance there last night, but it did not.
The constable stood at the door with re
volvers and kept the singers out. "

BRIEF BUT BUSY
HOUSE SESSION
Nine Bills Ara Considered
and Two Reports
Agreed To.
Such Industry Is Without a
Precedent in the Annals
of Congress.
Topics Discussed by the PrstUnt is
His Message Retemd to Appro
priate Committees
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 9.â The
session of the House to-day was conducted
under the influence of the spirit of labor
which marked the body yesterday, and
while it lasted less than three hours, nine
bills were considered and two conference
reports agreed to, in addition to some
other business. Such industry at the
opening of a session, even a short one, is
unprecedented in the annals of Congress.
Among the bills passed to-day were the
following: Extending until July 1, 1904,
the period within which the University of
Utah may occupy certain public lands
crantea to it. Authorizing the Secretary
of tie Interior to u-e the abandoned mili
tary reservation at Fort Bidwell, Cal.', for
an Indian training school. Authorizing
the joini entry and equitable division of
lands when two or more settlors locate
homestead entries upon the same tract of
agricultural land before survey. Author
izing Flasstaff, Ariz., to issue $750,000 of
bonds for water works. Abolishing the
arbitrary power of the Secretary of the
Territory of New Mexico to organize the
Legislature.
A Senate bill was also passed author
izing associations of farmers and stock
raisers to locate and purchase publio
lands for reservoir sites, irrespective oi the
homestead or pre-emption acts. Senate
any. ndments to the House bill affirming
the acts of the New Mexico Legislature
authorizing the issue of about $700,000 of
bonds for Territorial buildings were con
curred in, with an amendment. The
Senate amendment validates $172,500 of
railroad bonds issued by the county of
Santa Fe, against which at the last se-sion
an obstinate fight was made. To-day the
matter was not even discussed.
Tbe Senate's increase of the pension
granted to Mrs. Mary Gould Carr, widow
of General Carr, formerly Secretary of
State of New York, from $50 to $75 a
month, was agreed to by a vote of 146
to 89.
The usual resolution distributing the
topics of the President's message to the
appropriate committees was reported
irom the W T ays and Means Committee and
agreed to.
At 2:55 o'clock the House adjourned
until to-morrow.
FRANCIS' NOMINA -LON REFERRED
An Unusual Senate Proceeding, but â¢Jot
...-...Â«â Uifhout l l'reoeitent. i,,.. /^ j â 
WASHINGTON, oD. C. Dec. 9.â The
reference of the nomination of David R.
Francis of Missouri to be Secretary of the
Interior to the Committee on Finance in
executive session to-day caused some com
ment among those not conversant with the
rules of the Senate. There is a belief that the
nominations of Cabinet officers have
a.'ways been promptly confirmed without
such committee reference, but this is not
correct, save in the case of a United States
Senator. Senators. nominated to Cabinet
places are supposed to be, as well known
to each member as to the special com
mittee, and courtesy alone has suggested
the practice of confirming them at once.
This practice, however, has its exceptions,
for when President Hayes nominated ex-
Senntor Carl Schurz to bo Secretary of the
Interior the nomination was referred and
an investigation as to his fitness and
qualification for the office was male. , : _*' .

TO PREPARE TARIFF BILL.
Republicans of the W.iys and Means
Committee to Confer.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 9.â A con
ference of the Republican members of the
Ways and Means Committee will be held
to-morrow night, probably at the rooms of
Dinglry, the chairman, to decide what
action shall be taken with reference to the
preparation of a tariff bill. The considera
tion of this question also involves the
necessity of an extra session. If it be de
cided to prepare a finished tariff measure
it is expected that arrangements will be
made for a series of hearings to the repre
sentatives of the manufacturing interests,
which will extend over a period of a
month or more. It is believed that if thÂ«
wori of preparing a tariff bill be delayed
until the latter part ot January, sufficient
time will remain before the 4th of March
to perfect the measure. Appearances
would indicate that Republican members
generally favor an extra session.
SIMPATHY FOR THE CUBANS.

Foreign Relations to-day was entirely In

tion of the Cuban affairs and the message
of the President and report of the Secra
tary of State on that subject. Not a mem
ber of the committee failed to express his
sympathy for. the patriots, but no tangible
suggestions were made nor was action ot
any kind taken. ; : '.'_.

Colonel Harrison Gray Otis of
Los Angeles Speaks for
California.
Suggests the Names of Joige Way
mire, Juige cc Haven and
EilwooJ Cooper.
CANTON, Ohio. Dec. 9.â Cabinet booms
resounded throughout the day at Canton.
The claims of Henry C. Payne were urged
with a good deal of force. General Powell
Clayton, who is thought to be a Cabinet
possibility, had a private conference with
the President-elect, and Colonel Harmon
Gray Otis of Los Angeles, Cal., talked
about a Cabinet position for a representa
tive for the Pacific Slope Statps.
A delegation of three Wisconsin men â
ex-Senator Philetus Sawyer, Governor
elect Schofield and ex-Congressman I-saac
Stepliensonâ called on Major MrKinley
this afternoon and told him that the Re
publicans of their State hoped he would
appoint Mr. .Payne to the Cabinet.
"Henry C. Payne,'' said ex-Senator Saw
yer, "is a practical, high-class man of
affairs and a keen, able political leader.
He is in every way fitted for a Cabinet po
sition, and we feel that his appointment
would be a good thing for the country
ami for the party. The wins; of the party
in Wisconsin which is not quite friendly
to him is neither potent nor important at
this time, from our point of view."
Governor-elect Schotield and Mr. Steph
enson were equally earnest in urging Mr.
Payne for recognition.
General Powell Clayton of Arkansas
talked in private with Major McKinley.
General Clayton secured ihe solid delega
tion from his State for Major McKinley in
the St. Louis convention, and managed
the speaker's bureau at the New York
headquarters of the Republican National
Committee during the campaign.
General Harrison Gray Otis of Califor
nia called on Major McKinley late this
evening concerning Cabinet possibilities
on the Pacific Slope. He said:
"We would like to have tiie far West
ern States represented in the Cabinet.
Judge Way mire of San Francisco has been
talked of as a Cabinet possibility. He is
a good man and an excellent lawyer. Ell
wood Cooper of Sante Barbara, who is a
scholarly man, a .hrst-class business man
and a highly successful practical farmer,
would make, I think, an excellent Secre
tary of Agriculture. One of the mosl
available men in the State is Judge J. J.
de Haven of San Francisco. He is a man
of fine character and one of our foremost
lawyers. He has been a successful Jus
tice on our Supreme bench, and is one of
the cleanest, ablest and mo^t thoroughly
high-mindeu men in tha West. He- is
well known by Major McKinley."
Mrs. McKinley, accompanied by ber
cousins, Mr. and Mrs. Lafayette McWil
liams of Chicago, will leave here to-mor
row night for a visit of several days in
Chicago at the residence of Mr. and Mrs.
Me Williams. Major McKinley will re
muin in Canton.
The visit of Henry E. Cooper, Hawaiian
Minister of Foreizn Affairs, and his stcre
tary, Benjamin Lodge Mark, to Major Mc-
Kinley naturally caused a good deal of
comment.
Minister Cooper called on Major Mc-
Kinley this afternoon, and was invited to
a private conference. Mr. Cooper said that
there was no treaty of annexation in
process of negotiation at Washington.
Major McKinley did not indicate to the
Minister what his views concerning the
relations of the Hawaiian Islands to this
country were. The interview was a short
one. but it was long enough to raise a
cloud of rumor an I gossip.
Among the other calier3 to-day were:
Congressman J. T. McCleary ot Minnesota,
Judge Jacob R. Blair of Utah, Webb Hayes
of Cleveland, James Parmelee of New
York and Captain A. Lv Cope of Columbus.

December 7 about fifteen miles from
Havana between a reconnoitering party of
500 Spanish troops under Major Cirujeda
and about 2000 Insurgents, in which Maceo
is alleged to have been killed.
The rebels were found in a good position
â  at San Pedro, sheltered behind stone

During the reconnoisance upward of
forty dead rebels were found, among them
two bodies which were undoubtedly those

of Grave Discussion.
MADRID, f-PAi", Dec. 9.â The Heralde
says.: The Cabinet held a meeting to-day
*. for the purpose of considering President
; 'Cleveland'^ message to Congress. Ex-
Premier Sagasta declared that the message
wof so. much importance that he will
await the receipt of the full text of the
document before discuss it.
â¢" AH of the Spanish newspapers declare
. that the message provokes Europe, not
Spain alone. The general opinion here is
.that the references to Cuba and Spain
'' contained in President Cleveland's mes
sage to Congress show that it is the inten
tion of the United States to conform more
and more to the Monroe doctrine
0 time a case nrises to which that principle
is applicable.
The Cabinet after debating the text of
tho message to-day will form a definite
judgment, which it is believed will result

BOSTON, Mass , Dec. 9.â Captain G. H.
Lane of the Cuban army was in Cam
bridge today and he characterized the
report of Maceo'a drath as a Spanish trick
Â»o off-et the effect of the message of Presi
dent Cleveland. While it was possible, ,
I
he said, that Maceo had been Killed, yet it
was altogether improbable that he would
have been found by the Spaniards at the
head of so small a detachment of men as
it is reported be was leading. Then again,
he stated, the general was certainly miles
away from where the skirmish is reported
to have occurred.
Captain Lane left here to-night for New
York. He was wounded badly about two
months ago by a gun shot in the leg and
was granted a month's leave of absence.
He is now on bis way back to Cuba.
While Captain Lane would not speak of
the number of men in the Cuban army,
he stated that they were numerous enough
to meet Weyler and his soldiers in open
battle, if Gomez and Maceo so determined,
with tbe result that the Spanish would be
driven to Havana in disorder.
Tbe captain is an American, and with a
former Harvard student owned and
operated a sugar plantation in the province
of Havana at the time the insurgents first
rose la the East. He known nothing of
tne reported death of Major Osgood.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 10, 1896.
SHE WANTS TO
FIGHT SHARKEY
The Sailor Challenged by
a Colored Woman
of Chicago.
Will Meet Him in a Four-Round
Go for Points or to a
Finish.
She Is the Daughter of a Oace Cele
brated Bruiser Known as
"Sleepy Frank."
CHICAGO, 111., Dec. 9. â Mrs. Rosa
Boyd, whose distinguished qualities are
her wonderful strength and the fact that
she is tho wife of a shouting colored evan
gelist, wants to fight Sharkey, the pugil
ist, and has already sent a challenge to
the hardy man-of-war's man.
Before the week is ended Sharkey will
receive tnrough the mails tne following
bold defiance from the Chicago colored
woman:
Thomas Sharkey, San Franciscoâ^Dear Sir: I
would like to box you four rounds for points
or to a finish for the largest pursed offered by
any club, or lor gate receiptsâ winner to take
ah.
Am a woman and colored, but mean busi
ness and am exceedingly anxious to complete
arrangements ior h match at once, as I think
the oddity of the affair would mean money lor
the one who -wins. Awaitinj; an early reply, I
aDi, yours truly, Mrs. Kosa BoYd.
Mrs. Boyd and her husband live on
Armour avenue, in the neighborhood of
the recently organized "MeKiniey Zion
Church." They are both Zionites and,
although not members of the congrega
tion that worships in the cnurch with the
elongated name, the Rev. Mr. Boyd is an
enthusiastic evangelist and is well known
tnroughout the South, where he and his
wife formerly lived, as "the Black Sara
Jones."
The Boyds have lived in Chicago about
a year, coming here from St. Louis. Mrs.
Boyd has always been an athlete. She is
the daughter of "Sleepy Frank, 1 ' a once
celebrated colored rough-and-tumble
fighter and boxer, noted for his phenome
nal strength and was trained almost from
her infancy by him.
She is a tall, powerfully built woman,
weighing fully 180 pounds; is 28 years old
and is apparently as active on her feet as
the proverbial "Kitten." To a reporter
who called on her she said:
'Yes, I have challenged Mr. Sharkey
and am in earnest about it, too.
"I will box him for points or in any way
he desires, and am anxious for the match
to be brought about as soon as possible.
You see I take after my father, who, in
ray opinion, was the greatest fighter that
ever lived. Sharkey, Jackson and Fitz
simnions would have been only play
things lor him.
"Why, he was built like Walcott,
weighed 190 pounds, had longer arms
than Peter Jackson and could hit so hard
that wherever he went there was an un
written law established by the magistrates
that he should strike iio man with his
closed fist. He could defend himself only
with his open hand.
"All the champions of his day refused
to right him in the ring, but he whipped
'Yankee' Sullivan rough-and-tumble
style and knocked Tom Hyer stiff with a
single blow. One day, on the Erie canal,
he lifted itn anchor that seven men could
not budge.
"He could jump twelve feet backward,
so you see I snould not fear Sharkey. Yes,
all I have said about my father, and there
are several people in Chicago who knew
him personally, is true.
"I sent my challenge to Sharkey day
before yesterday. I consider him the
champion, ana I am anxious toshow what
a colored woman can do with him. Of
course I would rather box him for points,
but have no fear of him at any style.
"Men who have boxed with him before
hayÂ«Â» gone at it in the wrong way. I
should never use my riyht hand on him
: except in close countering. He should be
: kept in the lead and met with straight,
stinging lefts and swinging left upper
cuts. 1 should try to close his eyes and
weaken him by keeping his nose bleeding.
"When I saw him geuine shaky I should
bring up my right and put him out."
Mrs. Boyd is a good-looking, intelligent
woman, and is pleasant in manner. She
says she expects to get an answer from
Sharkey soon and to really enter the ring
with him.
AFTER HIS FEES.
Dr. Blare Tevinggton's Interest in the
lair 1 stuff Wag Garnisheed
Yesterday.
A garnishment was placed on Dr. Marc
Levingston's interest in the Fair estate
yesterday at the instance of J. J. Raver,
who holds claims against the physician
amounting to nearly $5000.
Two years ago Attorney John M.
Ch'etien, who held promissory notes of
L?vingston's amounting to $3519, sold the
same to J. J. Raver, and it is on this
claim, with costs and interest, that the
Fair estate trustees were served with the
garnishment. Raver claims that the
estate owes the doctor $10,000 for medicai
services rendered to the late Senator, but
the trustees are of a diffeient opinion.
When the rnpers were presented by
Deputy Sheriff Byington yesterday they
declared the estate was not indebted to
Levingston in the sum of $10,000 or any
other sum.
A HEAVY SENTENCE.
One of the Dick Williams Defaulting
Witnegges Sent to Prison.
Wong Gim, a witness in the Dick Wil
liams case, yesterday learned that the
way of the transgressor is hard and that
the Federal courts, like the buzzsaw, are
not to be handled with impunity. When
Dicfc "Williams was on trial Major Moore
of the Treasury Department learned that
Gim possessed much valuable knowledge
of tbe ways of thrifty Dick. He got from
the Mongolian a statement that Williams
once extorted a large sum of money from
Gtm for making a favorable report to Col
lector Wise, upon which Gim's nephew
wns permitted to Jand.
Just before the time for Gim to testify
in court to these facts he, with several
other witnesses, disappeared and he kept
out of the way until a week ago, when
Major Mo re arrested him in Chinatown,
the fellow having just returned from Los
Angeles. Gim decided to plead guilty of
contempt oi court and .ludge Morrow pro
ceeded "to relieve hi 3 mind upon the mat
ter. He said that he is determined that
tue business of the court and the adminis
tration of jusiice must not be obstructed
by witnesses who are not desirous of tes
tifying. In order to imoress upon Gim
the enormity of his offense and upon his
countrymen the fact that they must obey
a summons of the court he decreed Wonp
Gim guilty of contempt of court and
sentenced him to imprisonment for one
year in the San Francisco County Jail.
The culprit was staggered, for as his at
torney intimated he did not expect to bo
imprisoned over five or ten days.
A Vicious Dog.
Policeman Gus Videau swore to a complaint
yesterday morning for the arrest of Martin T.
Doyle, 139 Silver street, for allowing a vicious
dog to be at lsrge. Monday night the dog at
tempted to bite Mrs. John E. Heilman in front
of St. Rose's church, Brannan street, and
when the husband, who is a Deputy County
Clerk, jumped in to protect her the dog bit
him severely in the right calf and left thiÂ«h.
Heilman fired tt the dog but missed it and it
ran away. Policeman Videau found it at 514
Brannan street and took it to tbe City Prison.
INSANITY PLEA FILED.
Dennis McCarthy Cannot Have a New
Trial on Ihat Plea.
Dennis McCarthy, who killed George
Fox, and who was convicted of mnrder in
the first degree, has been denied a new
trial by the Supreme Court. The decision
was handed down yesterday. The defense
was insanity, the homicide being admit
ted. Tho trial court was found to have
charged the jury correctly in these words:
You are not to consider whether or not the
defendant is insane at the present time, but
you are to consider him as now sane. A person
charged with a crime cannot be legally tried
for huch crime unless he bo sane at
the time of the trial. The defendant has
presented the issue that at the very time of the
alleged commission of the homicide he was
insane. As I have already told you, the bur
den of proving his insanity nt that time rests
upon him. because the law presumes he was
then sane.
The court found that "the killing was
an exceptionally cold-blooded and wanton
one, inflicted upon a defenseless man from
no other cause, so far as manifest, than a
feeling of petty spite and jealousy having
no foundation, whiie the evidence relied
upon to estaplish the defense of insanity
was so entirely lacking in material sub
stance that no unbiassed jury, them
selves enjoying the blessing of sane and
rea u oning minds, could have justly reached
a different conclusion."
THE RIATA USED AGAIN,
Humane Methods No Longer
Employed by the Pound
Deputies.
They Tab:o the Net and the Humane
Society Will Shake Up the
Institution.
The riata has come into use again on
the public streets with deputies of the
public Pound in their business of catch
ing dogs, and with it is revived a custom
of former days, when the City Ponnd was
synonymous with barbarism. The heavy
noose curling over frightened animals,
that howl with agony as the rope tightens,
has come to be preferred by the dog
catchers instead of the humane net intro
duced after a long struggle by the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
It was news to the secietary of tho
society, Charles, lloi brook, when be
learned yesterday that Pound deputies
had gone back to barbarous methods
whereby many a valuable dog was ruined,
and in every instance catching was at
tended by cruelty.
"I am surprised to hear this," said Mr.
Holbrook.
"The society has known nothing about
it and I'm sure that Mr. Osborne, the
Pound Master, would not tolerate such a
thing for a minute. He certainly is not
aware that his deputies usa the riata in
stead ot the net. For my part I shall bring
up the matter before tha board wnen it
meets next Thursday.
"Our society shall resent this. We
bought a lot for ?!*OOO, and in all spent
over $18,000 in the new Pound that ani
mals lound on the streets would be sure
of humane treatment. We furnished the
entire equipment, including carts and
nets and asphyxiation chambers, at con
siderable expense, and it is really provok
ing that deputies should thwart our pur
pose.
"The net is the modern way of catching
dogs without injury or pain. The riata
went out with the old order of things â
with Jake Lindo and his methods. The
riata is used only for goats, but dipnties
are not allowed to use the rope on dogs.
That is positively against tbe rules.
"When tho society got control of the
Ponnd it sent all over the world for sug
gestions as to the most humane methods
of catching and killing do^s and finally
adopted the net as the most approved way
of catching and asphyxiation as the best
way of killing. We kill between 5000 and
ami 0000 dogs a year now and there is not
the slightest suggestion of cruelty in it,
except what you tell me now and of which
we were lenorant. "
Still the deputies gave an exhibition of
old-time methods a fsw days ago in the
north end of the City. There were four of
them on the Ponnd wagon and another in
a blue sweater who chased the dogs with
the riata, which he threw lite a trained
cowboy. The dogs caught in the lasso
howled, but they were powerless when
tied in a knot. Meanwhile the humane
net lay unused on the wagon.
From what the secretary remarked it
is liKely that there wil! be a change of
deputies and a general shake-up in the
public Pound.
FOWEKS' SEAT CONTESTED.
John A. Hoey Says He Was legally
Elected to the Legislature.
John A. Hoey, Republican nominee for
the Assembly in the Thirty-second As
sembly District, has filed a contest to the
election of John W. Powers, who was de
clared the winner by 22 votes.
In assigning reasons for the contest Mr.
Hoey says that in two precincts which
went against him the numbers were not
torn from the ballots before they were de
posited, thus violating the Jaw, which pro
vides that there shall be a secret ballot;
that in two precincts the election inspect
ors refused to count votes for Hoey when
the X was placed before his name instead
of alter the name in the blank space left
for saidX ; that in one precinct 33 votes for
Hoey were thrown out because the voters
attempted to vote for too many Presiden
tial electors.
Testimony in regard to the allegations
of set lorth in the complaint will be taken
by A. J. Morgenstern. attorney for Mr.
Hoey, before Justices of the Peace Kerri
gan and Groezinger. After the testimony
is written out it will be forwarded to the
Speaker of the Assembly
KEARNY-STREET LIGHTS.
They Will Be Kxteuried Beyond Calia
fora in Street to Broatlwuy.
Keainy street is to be lighted with electric
lights from Market street to Broadway.
It has been known for some time that the
popular thoroughfare would be lighted by
a new system as far as California street,
and this led the business men toward the
north to go to worli and, if possible, com
plete t lie undertaking.
Dr. 11. Morton Jr., H. Jacobs and Ed
ward Holland took an active interest in
the proposition and have succeeded in
obtaining a sufficient number of signa
tures and promises of linancial aid from
business men to assure its success.
To-day the street, from Broadway to
Greon. will be canvassed and if the busi
ness men in that district take a favorable
view the line of lights wili be extended
over the bill.

"ART OF CONVERSATION."
Elizabeth Strong Worthlngton Will
Lecture on the Subject
To->'ight.
Elizabeth Strong Worthincton will lec
ture this evening at the Emmanuel Bap
tist Church on the "Art of Conversation."
The silver-tongned Jady holds that a pupil
can be trained in eloquence and carried
from the alpha of the system, by succes
sive steps, up to the oraeea, pretty much
as a child in mathematics goes from once
one is one up to conic sections. Under
Mrs. Worthington's tuition the male pupil
may move "listening Senates" and the fe
male scholar have the last word that will
check further debate on the part of the
opposite) sex.
Mrs. Worthington is a lady of wealth
and culture, who took up the study of the
art of How to talk when quite youne, and
for many years has taught conversational
classes in Chicago and St. Louis. In her
lecture she clearly describes the course of
study and training and the method which
any intelligent person may employ, even
at home, in order to acquire ability la the
noble art of eloquence. Her entire lecture
is illustrated by anecdotes and sketches of
character, given as only an elocutionist
can give such work.
I'ire in a Dwelling.
At 8:12 o'clock yesterday morning an alarm
was soundert from box 285 for a tire in George
Hawley's residence at 2030 Bryant street. It
is supposed that tbe blaze was started by rats
gnawing the heads off a bunch of matches.

"A Consummation Devoutly to Be
Wished," and the Scare May
Have an Eff;ct.
LONDON, Eng., Dec. 9.â A representa
tive of the United Associated Presses vis
it* d the Foreign Office to-day for the pur
pose of a^certainins the trutti or falsity of
a dispatch published by a Now York news
paper this morning and cabled here, al
leging that Russia, France and England,
with the assent of Germany, Austria and
Italy, would nt once compel the Sultan to
adopt radical reforms under the jofr.t su
pervision ol ihe three powers first named,
etc.
Alter reading the dispatch the Foreign
Office officials declared the statements con
tained therein to be absolutely unfounded.
The status quo they saul had not been
chai.ged in the slightest degree. Ttie
powers, the authorities added, were still
trying to agree upon apian of exerting
pressure upon the Sultan to induce him to
enforce the reforms in Turkey that had
been promised, but it would be a long
time buiore they would think of moving
troops and ships. Still, they said, they
they were glad that stories of the kind
shown them were published, as tbey might
have the effect to frighten the SulUm into
action in the direction of instituting
reform?.
The Birmingham Post prints a London
dispatch similar to the one described
above, qualifying it by saying "it is
BtateÂ«i" that fleets will shortly be mobil
ized in order that they may be ready, if
it should become necessary, to enforce re
forms in the Ottoman empire. The re
ports do not attract much attention here,
cs they are reearded a3 belonging to the
series of the Turkish situation which are
always shown to be false when inquired
into.

Congressman Carniona of Mexico Dying
from a Peculiar Wound.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Dec. 9.- Don Jor?e
Carmona, a memDer of the Mexican Con
gress, is dying from the effects of a pecu
liar accident. A few weeks ago he had
occasion to rebuke a messenger-boy for
some misdeed and the boy turned and
struck him in the hand with a lead pencil.
The point penetrated the wrist of the
right hand and the lead broke off in the
wound. It was removed, and Mr. Car
niona thought nothing more about it
until his hand began to swell ana cause
intense pain.
Then he consulted a physician, bnt in
spite of the best of nieiical attendance he
grew rapidly worÂ«e. An operation was
performed, butu t the malady was not re
moved and two more operations were
made to save the patient's life. His asony
was somewhat alleviated, but the poison
iiad become so en trenched in the system
that it could not be eradicated.
Last Friday the victim confessed nnd
partook of the sacrament, and since that
time has been in an unconscious state.
Noihinc but milk is fed to him. At last
accounts his death was hourly expected.
A black substance had appeared upon his
toncue indicating the presence of gan
grene, which the physicians said pre
cluded ali non? of recovery.
NO SOFT SNAP IN
BRITISH COLUMBIA
J. T. Gove, a Veteran Miner,
Back From a Visit
to the North.
The GoM Found in Granite and
With Plenty of Pyrites
of Iron.
J. T. Gove, the widely known ore-buyer
and owner of gold properties in Mariposa
County, is at the Palace. As the repre
sentative of the Omaha and Grant Smelt
ing Company he has been on an extended
trip through Montana, Idaho. Washing
ton and British Coinmbia. He will now
remain here, probably most of the winter.
Mr. Gore is not strongly impressed with
British Columbia, especially as a mining
country, and thinks California for gold
mining, as well as for other purposes, is
far ahead of it. In a word he thinks the
average California miner is well off com
pared with those who are now trying their
luck in the snowy fields of British Colum
bia.
"I spent a great deal of time while out
on this trip," said Mr. Gove, "in examin
ing new districts and noting the progress
of old ones. Give me California as a min
ing country, especially for gold mining.
There is no other State or Territory that
can compare w ith her.
"Here is a fine climate, plenty of wood
and water, Dife veins of quartz, and all
easily reached from San Francisco, in
many cases by rail direct. A man doesn't
really realize all the advantages till he
takes his chances on the frontier by stage
in all kinds of weather.
"A good deal of my time was spent up
in British Coin mbia. I was at Rossland
and many other places. I visited Ains
worth, New Denver and the Trail Creek
region pretty thoroughly. I also visited
the Siccan country. As a whole I was not
impressed with the country as a place for
money-making.
"Rossland iÂ« a town of 7000 or 8000 peo
jle, pretty high in the mountains. I
don t think much of it. The ore about
there is all in granite with pyrites of iron.
"The Le Roi, the best mine there, ap
pears to have got its best rtays behind it.
The owners shipped 12.000 tons of their
ore to Great Falls, and it went $37. They
built a smelter, and their first lot of ore
there ran about $40, and their laÂ»t lot
dwindled down to about $16â too low to
pay. The other gold properties around
there have not come up as was expected.
I don't see any great future for the place.
"The Slocan silver mines pay $100,000 a
month. If silver was worth $1 an ounce
it would be great ore. The ore is very
rich, in narrow veins.
"Ainswortb is a very lively place, and a
good business point. It's the best place
up there. New Denver doesn't amount to
much yet.
"I w"as at Spokane a few days. There id
a population of about 30,000 there, but a
great deal of it is floating. Property is
very cheap.
"The property in British Columbia is
nearly all owned by the Canadians. There
are few Americans there. The people
have come in from the vicinity of Mon
treal, Quebec, Toronto ana other places in
the Eastern provinces. The larger part of
them never saw a mine, having never had
any tort of experience before. It is an in
vasion of tenderfeet."

A CATTLE KING
OF ARGENTINA
Arrival of L. C. Smith,
the Possessor of a Vast
Principality.
Every Effort Now Being Made,
He Says, to Get Heavy
Meat and Hides.
L. C. Smith, one of the cattle kings of
Buenos Ayres, is at the Palace on his way
to New Zealand to study up some of the
details of the cattle and sheep business as
carried on there. Mr. Smith's family have
L* C. Smith, One of the Beef
Barons of Argentine.
[Sketched from life by a "Call" artuL]
been in the livestock business in Argen
tina for more than Sfty years. They went
to Argentina from Scotland.
He and his partner own nine leagues, or
about 72,000 acres of land, capable of sup
porting from 17,000 to 18,000 cattle 4nd
55,000 sheep. They pay us much attention
to the sheep as to the cattle.
"There has been a gooa deal of money
made down thereout of livestock," said
Mr. Smith. "More than anywhere in the
States, Australia, or anywhere. The reason
is, I think, that there is no other country
so well adapted to cattle especially.
"Though the ranch which I am inter
ested in may be supposed to be large, it is
moderate compared to some in the hands
of the old fumilies there. Some have as
many as thiuy leagues in a ranch, and
well stocked, too.
"We have as our principal breeds of
cattle the Durhams and Herefords; but
just now some are going in for Polled
Angus, the cattle without tiorns. It is
not because they are hornless that people
are getting them, but because they nave a
heavier hide and heavier meat.
"Everything is toward getting meat and
hide. It is so even with sheep. We have
the Leicesters, Southdowns and Lancaster
shires for shipping. We ship vast quanti
ties of beef, mutton and hides to England.
That is our great market. Argentina a'
fords a splendid field for people who un
derstand this industry.
â¢'I went out there many years ago. It was
pretty rough at first, but I saw a future in
ie and so stayed and stack to it. I had
learned to ride all kinds of horses and to
throw a lasso, so that what was at one
time extremely difficult is now easy.
Argentina is a country really not explored.
"On our place is twelve miles of forest.
It is of espinillo trees. The trees grow so
last that you may cut them off, and in
four years, if you leave a little shoot, it
will be big enough to cut for wood."

STANFORD'S TRACK MEN.
Training for the Intercollegiate Contests
Commenced â Lacrosse to Be
Introduced.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Dec
9. âSince football has ceased to occupy the
minds of the students, the track men have
come into greater prominence. There
has been a gradual improvement in the
quality of each succeeding track team sent
out from Stanford. Last year the Stan
ford and Berkeley teams tied in the inter
collegiate meet. Just what kind of a
team will be produced for the next meet
is a matter of conjecture.
Charles Dole '98, captain of the track
team, gave notice that the men would be
expected to train on the track three times
a week. H s object is to bring out the
distance runners especially, and to put
the other men into as good form as pos
siDle. Active training will be deferred
until after the holidays. Several men
have responded to the call. Monday,
Wednesday and Friday are the favorite
days for practice.
Of last year's team Joe Bernhard, George
Tcombs, Ralston Wilbur, C. R. Frnzier,
H. B. Reynolds, J. Colliver, David Brown
and A. H. Jack have either graduated or
have already competed four times in an
intercollegiate event. Most of these men
are the best yet developed at Stanford and
their absence will create vacancies difficult
to fill.
Toe class of 1900 brought in some prom
ising material. The following new men
have signified their intention of trying ior
places:
F. Blrtob, S. B. H. 8.. 100-yard dash, 10 1-5

An intercollegiate game of lacrosse will
probably be played by the two universi
ties next semester, and men are already
in training for the event. It has long
been the dee. re of lacrosse enthusiasts at
both Stanford and Berkeley to put this
fascinating sport on record as an inter
collegiate contest. Everett Brown, cap
tain of the U. C. track team, has written
to Charles Doie, captain of the Stanford
track team, that the lacrosse players will
go into active training as soon as a siege
of examinations at Berkeley has passed.
The candidates for the team at Sumfc-rd
practice several times a week. Most of
the men are new at the game, but are
learning the principles rapidly. William
Dully, Charles Pope, John Brunton, A. C.
Gamer, Milnor Roberts, Charles Dole,
John Gregory, C. G. Decker, G. R. Green
leaf, William McLaine are araone the
number who have ordered "sticKs" and
plan to try for the team.

PASTOR McLEAN
ASSAILS GLASS
The Los Angeles Parkhurst
Denounces the Chief
of Police.
Wants to Wear a Star Because
the Regular Detectives
Are Lax.
Declares the Reform Society Has a
"Cinch" Against Three Hun
dred Offenders.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Dec. 9.âSpecula
tion has been rife here to-day respecting
the object of Parson McLean in applying
to the Board of Police Commissioners to
be appointed a special police ullicei with
out pay on behalf of the Parkhurst So
ciety. Rev. Mr. McLean to-night ended
all speculation on this score by statiug his
position.
"The reason I want to be an officer,"
said he, "is this: When I see a man or
woman has violated the law I want to
have the authority to make the arrest im
mediately. lam not afraid. If I were
an officer I would march my prisoner
right up to the jail.
"The Chief of Police has gone back on
us, and I am determined to prosecute
this work and bring the violators of the
law to justice. I wanted the Commis
sioners to make me a special officer and be
allowed to carry a weapon because I con
sidered it necessary to facilitate tne work.
I felt that I needed the protection that
the law throws about an officer. The
matter was referred to the Chief for his
opinion. It was then that Glass showed
his hand."
On the point of employing outside of
ficers to assist in the crusade Mr. Mci^an
said :
"We engaged a number of out-of-town
detectives and many private citizens vol
unteered to procure evidence. No, we
didn't accept any of the Chief of Police's
detectives, for 1 could not trust one of
them. We have a 'cinch' on 300 cases.
We have the evidence to convict. There
are several cases now before the court
and we will enter a number of complaints
in Justice Owen's court. As fast as these
cases are disposed of we will file new ones.
We do not want to crowd the courts too
much."
FIGHT FOR WATER ENDED.
Judge MeKinley Decides the Lytle Creek
Contest.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Dec. 9.â The long

Pool-Selling Barred in Tolo.
SACRAMENTO, Cal.. Dec. 9â The su
pervisors of Yolo County to-day passed
an oidinance prohibiting the sale of pools
in that county after the la3t Saturday of
the present month. Accoidine to tele
phone adtteCl from Woodland there wÂ»s
a bitter wrangle over the movement
among the supervisors.
It is claimed that certain residents of
Sacramento who were unsuccessful in
securing telegraohic connection with In
gleside racetrack have played "dog in the
I man er" and caused t.e anti-pool-sellinjj
legislution to be passed in Yolo County in
order to shut off their competitors, who
were doing a thriving business.BUDD TO STRIKE
FOR ECONOMY
Radical Reforms Will Be
Recommended to the
Legislature.
Consolidation of Several Â£tate
Institutions Favored by the
Governor.
His Messagj Will Suggest That the
Army cf Public Servants Be
Reduced.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Dec. 9.âGov
ernor Budd has disappeared from public
view temporarily. When he reappears
his message to the coming Legislature
will have been promulgated.
Great as is the speculation ana possible
dread among those who serve the people
in the various State institutions that the
coming document will mitigate against
their retention during the coming two
years, the reality will probably be more
disagreeable than the suspense. Those
who nave been in almost daily contact
with the Executive have strong grounds
ior the surmise that all the State institu
tions will receive a thorough overhauling,
and the message will contain a mass of
statistics not flattering to the business
ability of the managers.
He will recommend sweeping reduction
in expenses and the consolidation of sev
eral State institutions. This proposed
consolidation will include the State
prisons, and the Governor will probably
recommend the abolishment of San Quen
tin, with one warden and a host of guards.
The inmates of \\ hittier School, he be
lieves, should be removed to Glen Ellen,
where they can be made almost self-sup
porting by the establishment of a State
dairy and creamery, the girts going to
Preston and the feeble-minded to Whit
tier. TheMendocino Insane Asylum may
also receive attention, as there is no doubt
that the Governor considers it a useless
institution.
Another subject to be introduced will be
the fact that a large percentage of the in- >
nates of the insane asylums are not legally j
entitled to a home in these institutions, i
yet they are and for years have been ad- |
mitted and cared for. He will recommend j
that a bill be passed abolishing existing
asylum boards and providing for one non
partisan board of from seven to nine mem
bers to control the entire system of lunatic
asylums, with power to employ one general
supervising head, who shall be an export
and not o:herwise connected with any of
the institutions.
The message may ignore all State com
missions, with the possible exception of
the Bureau of Highways and the Code
Commission, which may receive favorable
recommendations, the latter to continue
until its work be finished, but not for two
years. It is said that the message may
recommend that the Horticultural, Viti
cnltnral and Mining bureaus be handed
over to the control of the State Univer
sity.
Another matter which the Governor has
formally denounced is the granting of
bonuses to counties for the support of
their poor and indigent. These, he claims,
should be made a matter of home support,
as the allowance from the State for each of
me aged poor on a county's roster is often
great -r than the expense of hi 3 mainten
ance, leaving a residue of profit and en
couraging a fictitious enlargement of the
roil.
The Soldiers' Home at Yountville will
without doubt receive mention in the
message, with a recommendation that no
lurther appropriations be granted toward
its support until it becomes a State insti
tution, and that the board of trustees be
formed of a majo r ity to be selected by the
various Grand Army posts, ihe minority
to be appointed by the Governor.
There will probably be a recommenda
tion for an appropriation of $175,000 for
the settlement of coyote claims, those to
be paid in full where no doubt exists as to
their legality and the others to receive
strict investigation.
bhould the refunding bill be mentioned
it will be adversely.
Among minor suggestions will be one j
for the appointment of an expert for the I
State Board of Examiners should the Su- j
preme Court return an adverse opinion re- j
garding the legality of the appointment of \
Lewis.
The present banking system and the
method of collecting: taxes throughout
the State may also receive mention.
In the matter of consolidation there
will also be included the recommendation
that the work of the Bureau of Public
Works, the Debris Commission and the
Bureau of Highways can all be performed
by one set of officials.
That there will be other and startling
revelations as to the present methods of
conductive the affairs of the State is as
sured, and knowing ones assert that the
Governor's message will produce "a rat
tling among dry bones."
FOR SA NTA CRUZ'S POOR.
Condition* of the hate" Jtarid Gharky'a
Will Are to 'Be Carried Out.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Dec. The wish"
of the late David Gharky, who died in this
city in 1877, to provide practical support
. for poor people in Santa Cruz County, is
just now about to be . realized. Mr.
Gharky's will first contemplated the
caring for his boy David out of the estate,
which was then valued at $25,000, and con
sisted of land in this city and some $2000
" in cash. Other lands in Indiana and* Mis
souri of unknown value belonged also to
his holdings.
After all other bequests had been made
* Mr. Gliarky bf quealhed to a board of trus
tees six acres of land in the southwestern
addition, in the neighborhood of Phelan
â¢ Park and CowelPs warehouse, and ex
pressed the wish that the. trustees should
so manage the property as to provide a
home and maintenance for as many de-
serving poor people in this county as pos
â¢ sible. The bonrd of trustees was composed
of Elibo AnUiony, J. H. Guild. J. W. Mor
gan, R. C. Kirby and G. M. Bockius. A
lumber of years ago Guild <iiea and
Henry P. X cp was appointed in his stead.
Â» Yesterday Mr. Rice, through bid attor-
I neys, Jeter and McKinney, aÂ«ked the
I County Board of Supervisors for permis
\ -on to convey the tract of Jaud, which is
valped at $3000, to the county to be used
lor the purpose contemplated by the I. lie
I At. Gharky. Mr. Rice stated in his peti
ion tl,at one of the trustees, John \V.
ii organ, bad recently died, two others
lad moved away and all the others were
rowiuc old, and felt that the effort to de
ive an income from the bequest was be
ond tiie.r ability. The land lias not been j
made to yield anything beyond a small
rental for pasturage, and there is an in
deDtedness of $300 against it.
The matter was referred to the District
Attorney, Carl Lindsay; who will loot
into the exact location and actual value
of the land. He is inclined to the opinion
that the tract may be made to yield profit
able fruit crops or disposed of to advan
tage, so that at least a beginning . for a
Poor People's Home may be made. He
will speak officially upon the subject
within a few days.
SAN MATEO RAILWAY PROJECT.
Double Track May Soon Be Built From
San Francisco to San
Jose.
REDWOOD CITY, Cal., Dec. 9. -From
present indications it would seem that be
fore the end of another year San Mateo
County people will see the completion of
a double railroad track from one end of
the county to the otber. For many years
the railroad company has talked of put
ting in a double track from San Francisco
to San Jose, but only lately has it taken
any active steps to put the plan into opera
tion.
Persons owning property alone the line
of the track are fe rantins rights of way.
Yesterday two deeds were riled of record
in the clerk's oflice of the county, grant
ing lnnd in tlie vicinity of San Carlos to
1 the Southern Pacific Railroad Company.
For the consideration of $1 Mary Burke
Brittain deeds to the company a strip of
land 20 feet wide by 620 feet long, on the
west side of the railroad track and parallel
to it. The erant is made on condition
that the railroad company shall construct
within one year a roadway sixty feet in
width, and that it shall move Dack right
of way fences and plant shade trees along
the same. The property conveyed is to
be used for railroad purposes, and if aban
doned at any time for such use shall re
vert to the grantor.
The second deed is signed by J. C. John
son, and is of exactly the same import,
except that the land conveyed imme
diately adjoins the Brittain property on
the south, and conveys h strip of land
20 feet wide by 1810 feet long. By these
two deeds the railroad company acquires a
continuous stretch of land over a half mile
long.
PENTURA- ELECTION CONTEST.
Peter Bennett Is After T. O. Toland'*
Seat in the Jj*ai*lature.
VENTURA, Cal., Dec. 9 âPeter Bennett
to-day filed with the County Clerk notice
of contest of the election of T. O. Toland
to a seat in the Legislature. His contest
i 3 based on the allegation that Toland dia
not file a statement of expenses, as
requ red, within fifteen days after election.
Toiana applied to Judge Williams of the
Superior Court for leave to file the state
ment after the time had expired. This
was granted, and on that s'-iowiiier, a cer
tificate of election was issued. The con
testant claims that the Superior Court had
no jurisdiction in the matter, and the pro
ceeuings as far as the issuing of the cer
tificate is concerned are of no effect.
Bennett is the present Assemblyman,
and claims to hold over on account of
Tcland's failure to comply with the law.

EUREKA, Cal., Dec. 9.â The jury in
the case of Otto Olsen, charged with man

gave her whisky irom a flask which he
brought. The child drank a large quantity

ing jury in the case, and it is probable the
case will now be dismissed.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 10, 1896.
THREE KESWICK
MEN WILL DIE
Nearly a Score Seriously
Injured in Tuesday's
Disaster.
Burning Oil Thrown Upon Them
When the Gasoline Tanks
Exploded.
Risked Their Lives to Check a Con
flagration at the Mining Com*
pany'i Smelters.
REDDING, Cal., Doc. 9.â The excite
ment and furor caused by the gasoline
explosion at Keswick last night had sub
sided to a considerable extent to-day, and
particulars which last night were not ob
tainable have been secured. The acci
dent, although serious, was not so disas
trous as was reported last night. Rumors
of all kinds were circulated on the streets
to the effect that there had been great
loss of life, but to-night it is known that
no fatalities resulted, but at least three of
the unfortunate victims are so badly
burned and injured that no hopes of their
recovery are entertained.
The explosion occurred about half an
hour after the night shifts at the big
smelters entered upon their duties. Only
a few men were in or about the company's
oilhouse at the time, and that building
was closed for the day. About 8 o'clock
flames were discovered issuing from the
north side of the building, and immedi
ately twenty-five or thirty workmen
rushed to the building, hoping to extin
guish the fire.
Just bow the blaze originated is not
known. There had been no fire in or
axound the building, and it must have
been caused either by sparks from the
smelter-stacks or from a c!gar-3tump
thrown by a careless workman.
Tne workmen procured buckets of water
and began the right, which nearly resulted
in the loss of their lives. Almost simul
taneously with the throwing of the first
bucketful of water on to the burning
building, there occurred a dull, heavy ex
plosion. A column of flame shot into the
air a hundred feet, and the walls of the
oilbouse were hurled with tremendous
force outward. The flying boards were
ablaze and the burning oil and gasoline
was sent scattering over the immediate
neighborhood.
In a moment all was over, and rescuers
at once began searching for the victims.
Twenty-three men had been badly burned
and otherwise injured by the explosion.
Some were lying helpless a short dis
tance from the ruins, while others not so
badly hurt were crawling away from the
fire in efforts to save themselves. After
telephoning to this city for medical aid,
the rescuers conveyed the victims to the
office and buildings of the company, and
made them as comfortable as possible un
til the physicians arrived. The flames
were soon extinguished, and, strange to
say, no damage resulted to other near-by
buildings.
H. Wise, a clerk of the Mountain Mines
Company, is me most dangerously injured
of the victims. Besides being badly burned
about the head and body, he inhaled the
flames of the burning gasoline and there
is no hope of his recovery. He has a wife
who is now at his bedside. Arthur Dean,
a Redding boy, was seriously burned about
the face and body, and may lose his eye
sieht. entirely. One of the victims, a man
named King, was brought to Redding to
day.
All the hair was burned from his head,
his face was horribly scorched and both
his hands burned so badly that the flesh
fell from the bones. A young man named
Truman, working beside Dean on the
night shift, was burned so badly that his
chances of recovery are considered doubt
ful. Pieces of fl sh fell from his face and
hands and he suffers untold agony.
A dozen others are seriously burned. No
one is blamed for the disaster. The oil
house was an old structure, formerly used
as a storehouse, md contained besides a
large quantity of coal oil about 150 gallons
of gasoline, which, as soon as the water
came in contact with it, exploded.
COMET DISCOVERED AT LICK.
Professor Psrrine Sights a Strange Wan-
derer Through the Observatory's
Te/escope.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Dec. 9.â A new comet
was discovered at Lick Observatory last
night by Professor C. D. Perrine in the
constellation of Pisces.
Its position is right ascension, 0 hours
and Â£4 minutes; declination, 6 deg. 20
mm. north. It is about as bright as a star
of the eighth magnitude and can be seen
with a telescope of moderate power. It
has a sharp stellar nucleus of 10% or
eleventh magnitude and is about five min
utes of arc in diameter.
There are indication? of a short fan
shaped tail. It is moving rapidly east,
and more slowly south.
To-night observations were taken, with
a view to ascertaining the siz? of its orbit
and how closely it will approach the earth.
The observations will be completed to
morrow night.

GUNS FOR SAN DIEGO HARBOR.
The Preliminary Work on the Government
Fortifications Is Soon to
Commence.
SAN DIEGO, Cal, Dec. 9.â E. P. Gray,
secretary of the California Construction
Company, is in the city attending to the
preliminary work of putting in the gun
emplacements and torpedo casement at
Ballast Point for the defense of San
Diego harbor.
"We hope to get the work started on
tne gun emplacements soon after January
1," he said. "It is rather a big job, as be
tween 10,000 and 11,000 cubic feet of con
crete work is to be done, and fifteen tons
of steel beams, bolts and so on to be put
in. Much of the work, of course, will be
excavating, where labor will get the bene
fit. There will be underground chambers,
with cast-iron steps, wrought-iron fittings
for doors, three-quarters of a ton of brass
fittings, electrical apparatus, speaking
tubes, brickwork, four ammunition-lifts
and four cranes and so onâ a lot of work
to be done. We calculate to finish the
contract in eight months.
"There is no money available for the
work and we staall have to wait until there
is an appropriation. Our contract calls
for $109,417 39.
"The guns will be fittPd with qnick, dis
appearing carriages, operated, I believe,
by pneumatics. Lieutenant Herbert
Deakyne, United States engineer, will be
in charge of the work here and I shall re
main to superintend it for the company:
The first work to be done is to build a
wharf 100 feet long on Ballast Point.
"The exact location of the guns will be
on the south or seaward side of Ballast
Point, between the old whaling station
and the old powder magazine.
"There isla bank there well above high
tide, and that has been cleared off. There
the underground chambers will be exca
vated, tho guns pointing s 'award. The
guns and the torpedo casement near by
will pretty effectually protect the harbor
from vessels attempting to enter, and the
mortar battery on Coronado Sandspit will
make it hot for vessels at anchor outside.
I have heard a rumor that bids will be
asked soon for the placing of this battery
on the sandspit, but I do not think any
thing will be done with that until Con
gress makes the appropriation for harbor
defenses."
KILLED BY A SUBORDINATE.
Chief Engineer Wi,son of the Michoacan
and Pacific Railroad Loses
His life.
FAN DIEGO, Cau, Dec. 9.â W. O. Wil
son, chief engineer of the Michoacan and
Pacific Railroad, was killed at Ocarapo,
Mex., last week by his subordinate,
Bishop King. The two men were engaged
in building the extension of the railroad
from Ocampo to Zitacuaro and quareled
over a detail of the engineering work.
Wilson, it is said, showed considerable
temper over an alleged delinquency on
the part of King and threatened to dis
cbarge him. King replied that the failure
to do the work was caused by Wilson's
own negligence in perfecting notes. This
led to sharp talk on both sides, which re
suited in blow*.
Wilson attempted to draw a pistol, but
King was too quick for him and attacked
him with the butt end of a revolver. He
rained beavy blows upon Wilson, while
the latter struggled to draw his weapon.
Finally the uproar drew otheis to the
scene and the men were separated. Wil
son became unconscious, and a surgeon
snid his skull was fractured. He died
soon afterward. King disappeared a ter
the fight, and telegrams were sent all
along the line to apprehend him. He kept
off the line, going into the interior past
Chopitli and Venidos, but was captured by
Mexican officers as he was boarding a
train at Pateo.
He was placed in jail there and will be
tried, probably at Ocampo, for murder.
Wilson was a well-known engineer in
the Southwest, having been connected
with the Southern Pacific, Mexican Cen
tral and other railroads. Bishop King,
his slayer, is said to have borne a good
reputation before the unfortunate occur
rence. No bail is allowed him, and his
friends Tear the confinement in a Mexi
can dungeon, with the interminable dÂ«
lavs of criminal proceedings, wiil cost him
his life.

PERSECUTED BY
A HIGHBINDER
Stockton Officials Expose
a Plot Against a
Woman.
Wong Chuck Sam Invokes the
Law to Gain Possession
of a Slave.
Causes Her Arrest on a Fictitious
Charge to Remove H.t Frcm
Christian Influence.
STOCKTON, Cal., Dec. 9.â A bold at
tempt to use the machinery of the law for
the purpose of recovering a Chinese
woman for her owner, who keeps a dis
orderly house in San Francisco, in which
the woman was formerly confined, came
to light here to-day. The name of the
woman is 800 Yok. Of late she has been
kept at the Chinese Mission of the Pres
byterian church in San Francisco. Her
owner, a notorious highbinder named
Wong Chuck Sam, has been endeavoring
to recover her from the mission, and went
so far as to offer a large sum of money as
a bribe to the mission's attorney, Henry
E. Monroe. It was then refused, and he
then went to a law clerk for J. C. Camp
bell, whom he offered $500 to carry out a
scheme for securing possession of the
woman by having a warrant for her ar
rest issued at Stockton.
According to the scheme, as Wong
Chuck Sam explained it, some Stockton
Chinaman was to accuse 800 Yok of petty
larceny. She would be arrested at the
mission and brought to this city immedi
ately. The arraignment would take place
at once, and her Stockton accuser would
come into court and state that the stolen
property had been returned. She would
then be turned loose only to fall into the
hands of the highbinders waiting for her,
who would make her a prisoner and take
her back to Wong Chuck Sam's house.
The law clerk to whom this scheme was
unfolded refused to have anything to do
with it. Attorney Macquarrie of this city
was interested in thÂ«* case, and went with
Go Sam, a notorious Stockton Chinese, to
the mission on Sacramento street, in San
Francisco. They could do nothing with
the girl, and later a scheme was concocted
by the highbinder to have her arrested for
the alleged theft of some gold bracelets
from another Chinese here named Ah
Sing. The warrant was issued secretly
and the woman arrested in San Francisco,
but her friends gave bail, and Miss Cul
bertson and Attorney Monroe came to
Stockton with her yesterday.
At the trial to-day the evidence of the
highbinders ana the others connected
with the plot was of such a nature that
Assistant District Attorney Baldwin
dramatically asked that the case be dis
missed, saying that it was nothing but a
highbinder scheme and that rank perjury
had been committed by those who were
trying to get possession of the young Chi
nese girl. She was discharged from cus
tody, and the matter will probably be
brought to the attention of the next
Grand Jury.
MUST RECORDERS GIVE BONDS?
Novel Point Raised in the Trial of
Gilbert P. Hall at Santa
Rosa.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Dec. 9.â The at
torneys for tho defense in the case of
Sonoma County vs. ex-County Recorder
Gilbert P. Hall and his bondsmen raised a
novel point this morning and created
something of a sensation among the legal
fraternity. The prosecution rested yester
day afternoon. The first move of Attorney
AnÃ n Hilton for the defense this morning
was to ask for a nonsuit on the following
grounds:
Firstâ That there is no law in the State
requiring a County Recorder or any other
county official to give a bond.
Secondâ Mr. Hilton urged that the pro
visions of the act of 1883, which provides
that the boards of Supervisors in counties
shall fix the amounts of official bonds, are
unconstitutional and void, upon the
ground that it is an attempt to delegate
to boards of Supervisors the duty which
the constitution- expressly imposes upon
Legislatures, and upon the further
ground that it has the effect of special
legislation, and aoes not conform to the
provisions of the constitution, which re
quires that the Legislature shall provide
for the government of townships and
counties by general an a uniform law.
After a storm of argument, his Honor
denied the application for nonsuit, hold
ing that it was the duty of the trial court
to sustain the acts of the Legislature unless
it appeared from some decision of the
State ?ourt that it was unconstitutional.
The court, however, conceded that it was
a very close point, and intimated that the
higher court might sustain the proposi
tion. Of course this would affect every
county officer in the State, and it has
added new interest to an already interest
ing trial. â 
PORTLAND DAMAGE SELT.
San Zuit Jtetf lrriyation Plant Scan
T Ocran3i<ie Involved.
PORTLAND. Or., Dec. 9.â San Luis
Rey Valley irrigation plant, near Ocean
side, Cal., is involved in a big suit which
has been instituted in the State Circuit
Court here. J. A. Jones, who is repre
sented as the chief contractor for the
work and the owner of valuable rights of
way and franchises, is the plaintiff, and
on account of a breach of contract he has
filed suit to recover damages to the extent
of $225,000 Against Smith & Ben n am of
Biy City, Mich. The suit was filed here
in order to obtain service on Benham, who
was just boarding a train for the sound.
Defendants failed to assign to plaintiff
13/-3 per cent of the capital stock of the
concern, or nssign to him a claim of
$1966 55 as agreed in the contract. By
reason of this violation of the terms of the
agreement the contract for right oi way
and for land have all expired by limita
tion and have been canceled. The plain
tiff says further that they cannot be re
newed or revived and the loss incurred by
him, with loss of credit and mental worry,
is valued at $225,000.
SANTA CRUZ T RAMP AVIS NUISANCE.
Jlelief JUeature* Adapted by Vlttriet Ats
torney Zilndnty.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Dec. 9.â The tramp
nuisance is at present engrossing the at
tention of the Board of Supervisors and
the District Attorney, who are considering
measures looking to its abatement.
District Attorney Lindsay has sent out
letters to the several Justices of the Peace
in the county asking that his nrfice be in
formed of the arrest of vagrants so that
the people may be represented in the trial.
He suggests also that no arrests should he
made, except in flat-rant case?, unless by
a warrant upon complaint of some person
other than a peace officer. The object of
the first suggestion is to make the punish
ment of vagrants severe enough to deter a
repetition of the offenÂ«e, and of the other
suggestion to keep the chronic tra>eling
vagrant moving.
The jail of this county is almost wholly
occupied in the winter season by short
term vagrants who make this city or
county a convenient resting place. When
the weather is not favorable for traveling
afoot these fe.lows take care to have them
selves rearreste i usually within twenty
four hours after hnvinp been released, and
thus keep in comfortable quarters until
the weather changes. Tho movement now
set on foot by the District Attorney will
relieve the county of much expense and
the citizens of a chronic nuisance.

THE EXAMINER UNMASKED.
The braggart and bully of California journalism has been brought to bay at
last and is found to be only a scurvy and cowardly hyena, masquerading in the
skin of a bear. The Monarch of the Fakirs has had the cloak of its assumed
superiority as a censor of morals and defender of down-trodden virtue torn from
its hideous face, and it stands revealed before an aroused and outraged public as
the very opposite of everything it has pretended to be.
For the past several years the San Francisco Examiner ha 3 gone swaggering
up and aown the State of California claiming to be the monarch ot the dailies,
and posing as the champion in journalism of decency, propriety and truth. So
arrogant has been its assumption that for a time it seemed to have succeeded in
attaining the perfection of the faker's art by deluding the people of California
into the belief that its pretension was true. Emboldened by its success as a
faker, it naturally and speedily became the patron, publisher and friend of
every phase of fraud and folly. It embarked upon the flood tide of sen
sational journalism. It became the forked tongue of slander, the whispering
gallery ox scandal and the outstretched forefinger of suspicion. Its editorial
rooms became a breeding-place of snakes and toads and swarms of gnats, which
went forth daily to infest socieiy with hissing, croaking, buzz and sting. In
every community which was entered by the issues of its press it engaged in a
systematic scheme for the extortion of money from corporations, individuals and
industries, and sent to the State Legislature Andrew Lawrence as its special
representative, with carte blanche to bla ckmail everything in sight. It
prided itself upon its ability to browbeat and bulldoze Legislatures, con
ventions, officials, juries and courts. It sent its emissaries throughout
the State, seeking men and women of prominence, position and wealth, regarding
their substance and reputation as legitimate prey. Those whom it failed
to bleed it boldly attempted to ruin Dy persistent reiteration of falsehoods and by
every art of innuendo aÂ«d ridicule which it is withia the reach of a conscienceless
publisher to employ.
The descent of such a newspaper from scandals and sensations to obscenities
and filth has been easy and swift. The natural bent of the Examiner to indecency
became finally irresistible, and during the past year, in defiance of every canon
of morals and of every duty to society, it has openly and shamelessly wallowed in
slime. The elevation to its editorial management of "Long Green" Lawrence was
a notice to the public that its natural instincts were to be gratified at any expense.
When the person who in former years had been its licensed blackmailer and
authorized representative in those lines of business of which the greenback is the
only safe medium of exchange, became its editorial head, what else could be ex
pected than indulgence in the obscenities and indecencies which have befouled
the Examiner's columns and brought the fair fame of California journalism into
disrepute?
The time for retribution has, however, come at last. The people of California,
who believe in the observance of decency in journalism, as in other forms of
human activity, have become indignant at the Examiner's open and shameless
violation of every law of honesty, propriety and truth. The respectable element
in our society is aroused to the necessity of an immediate crusade against the per
sistent pandering of that newspaper to the depraved tastes of the slums.
The honest and reputable press of the entire State is engaged in scourging
with a whip of scorpions this denier of their profession, and is resolved
to either drive it back to decency or to expel it from the State. The Call has
reluctantly departed from its long-maintained resolve to live in amity with its
contemporaries, to lead and to guide this crusade. It does this because the
moral welfare of the State demands that the homes and firesides of its people
should be saved from the pollution of "the new journalism," of which lur.
Hearst's newspaper is the local exponent. The subject is one which may well
engage the attention and enlist the assistance of every man and womnn who
believes in preserving the homes and families of California from an influx of
the foul and infectious slush and slime of such a newspaper.
THE VALLEY ROAD.
Work on the Valley road continues to
go forward with, an energy gratifying to
all who take an interest in the develop
ment ana the welfare of the State. While ;
the extension of toe line southward from
Fresno has been temporarily suspended,
owing to difliculti9s encountered in ob
taining rights of way the task of equip
ping the line between Stockton and (
Fresno and providing the road with ac- I
commodations for handling freight shows 1
no cessation of activity.
It is believed the work of extension
southward will begin again not later than
the early part of February. The one ob
stacle in the way- of advance is the lack of i
a continuous right of way to Bakerslield.
As soon as the route has been secured the
work of construction will be pushed for
ward with as much vim and energy as was
employed in constructing that portion of
the line already completed. Material for j
the southward extension has been already j
obtained and all preparations made for a {
speedy completion of the work as soon as
the right of way has been secured.
Two lines of road are to run southward
from Fresno. One of these will go by way
of Hanford and the route of the other is
to be determined by the concessions made I
by laud-owne;'s in the, matters of rights of i
way and depot sites. The advantages to i
be derived from the road are so great that
it is not likely the dosired concessions will j
be long withheld, and before the time
comes for moving the next grain crop
there are good reasons for believing that
all the country as far south as Baterslieid
will have the full advantage of a com
peting line.
The success which has attended the con
stiiictiou of the road ever since the project
was undertaken is one of the most grati
fying evidences we have of the awakening
of a new spirit of enerey and enterprise
among the people of California. The
work is the result of the co-operation of
San Francisco with the San Joaquin
and attests what can ba done when the
City and the interior work together for
the good of the State. This line, which
will break the monopoly in a wide region
of California, has within it the potency of
breaking it down in every portion of the
State. The work therefore is essentially
one for the welfare of the people and
there will be a universal gratification in
the knowledge that it is so rapidiy and
successfully going forward.
KILLING FROSTS.
It is reported that great damage has
been done to orchards ail round the Puget
Sound territory and throughout the
Noithern Pacific States generally by the
heavy frosts of the recent cold snap. It is
to be hoped that the worst of these reports
are exaggerations, and that the loss may
not be so heavy as at this time is feared.
Nevertheless it appears certain that the
fruit industry has been pushed too far
northward, and that Oregon and Wash
ington cannot hope to compete with Cali
fornia in the cultivation of such fruits as
require a mild climate.
The large profits obtained by California
orchardista in growing prunes led the
people of Washington and Oregon to
make extensive plantations of such trees
in those States. For some years past
these have done fairly well, but the he^vy'
frosts of this winter make it clear that tne
prune industry there is a hazardous ex
periment. It requires six years to bring a
prune tree into full bearing, and in a
climate where it is 1 able to be killed by a
sudden frost the industry cannot be profi
tably carried on.
The prune orchardists of the States to
the north of us are in about the same
position as the orange-growers in middle
Florida. TVe area of orange-planting in
that State was carried further and further
north with considerable success for some
years, but the end came with a severe
frost, which not only destroyed the crops,
but killed the trees. This meant a loss of
many years' work, and the orange-growers
in that section of Fiorida have been com
pelled to turn their attention to other
forms of industry.
For semi-tropical fruits there is scarcely
a safe area for cultivation in the United
States outside of California. In this State
the orchardists occasionally lose a crop by
the frosts, but they do not lose their trees.
The loss here is merely temporary. In
other States the loss in such cultivation is
not inirequently so disastrous as to com
pletely destroy entire orchards. This fact
seems to assure to California an easy su
premacy in the growing of semi-tropical
fruits, and removes from our orchardists
any fear of extensive competition in other
localities. '
Progressive merchants are showing
themselves everywhere.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 10, 1896.
THE HORSE SHOW.
The first day of the horse show was
sufficiently brilliant to assure the success
of the enterprise. Public interest has in
creased even over that of last year, and
the display will be successful not only as
an exhibit of fine horses and good driv
ing, but also as a social function.
It is not easy to overrate the benefits to
be derived from this and similar exhibi
tions. In Isew York, where they have
been held for more years than in any
other place in the Union, they have come
to be looked upon as the most popular
and among the most important of all in
dustrial expositions. The success and
value of such shows in tnat city have
ceased to be matters of doubt, and each
successive one is an improvement on its
predecessor.
Nature ha 3 fitted California to be the
elysium of horses. The climate is favor
able to him at all seasons of the year.
There is never a month when riding, driv
ing and racing cannot be practiced with
comfort both to the horse and his owner.
The Californians of the old Spanish days
were a race of accomplished horsemen,
and the native sons of to-day are rapidly
acquiring an equal fondness ana mastery
iv tue same pursnit.
The control of horses has ever been re
garded as one of the best accomplishments
of man. The modern world with its many
mechanisms for locomotion does not pay
so much attention to this art as was once
accorded it, but it is still held in high
esteem by all nations. The bold rider,
the skillfiil driver and the able trainer of
horses are objects of admiration in every
community, and it is not to be doubted
that this will always be so.
Among the great nations of Europe the
breeding of fine horses is a care of the
Government. The value of such animals
both in peace and in war is so well known
that the improvement of the breeds is not
left wholly to private enterprise. In this
country, however, we have trusted to in
dividual citizens to promote our breed of
horses and the tiust has not been in vain.
We have, in fact, beaten Europe. The de
gree of our success is visible at the present
show and moreover in the large attend
ance there of men and women of means
and fashion we nave every assurarce that
the good work will be continued and that
private wealth will in the future, as in the
paÂ«t, provide California with horses
second to none in the world.
TARIFF CONSIDERATIONS.
Reports from Washington tend to the
conclusion that while there is no possibil
ity of passing the Dingley bill in the form
in which it was presented at the last ses
sion, there will still be an earnest effort
made at some form of tariff legislation. The
statement of Mr. Cleveland in his message
that the present tariff is good enough and
that the deficit should not disturb us
rinds no more favor with the Republicans
in Congress than with the country at
large, and consequently they will make an
earnest and patriotic attempt to provide
as speedily as possible a revenue adequate
to the expenditures of the Government.
The objections to the Dingley bill are
so numerous it can hardly have much
support. In its essence the bill simply
raises the rate of duties fixed by the
present tariff. It is, therefore, subject to
all the objections which are inherent in
the nature of the Democratic law. The
Gorman tariff makes offensive discrimina
tions in favor of some industries against
others. A Republican tariff, therefore,
cannot be constructed on these lines. It
must be a radically different measure,
and provide for fair and honest protection
to all industries alike.
While the Dingley bill has found favor
with the wool-growers because it promises
something of protection to their industry,
it by no means does justice to other indus
tries no less important. Among the in
dustries thus discriminated against is that
of the production of sugar, and yet that
industry, by reason of competition with
cheap labor and the bounty systems of
other nations, has a peculiar need ol sup
port and encouragement on the part of the
Government.
We have fhe soil and climate suitable
for the production of sugar and the cap
ital necessary to carry on the industry.
With such protection as would be suffi
cient to counterbalance the low wages
paid id other countries and the bounties
given by other nations we could soon
build up in the United States a sugar in
dustry equal to all the demands of the
population. Tnere are good reasons for
believing that California alone could pro
duce all the sugar needed in America at
the present rate of demand. Whenever,
therefore, we set about devising a tariff,
we should revise it in ti.e direction of
giving protection to such industries as
this. If we are to have any tariff legisla
tion at all this -winter it should be legis
lation that will do justice to all sections
of the Union and all the industries of the
people.

THE INVINCIBLE PRESS.
Tacitly Recognized as a Necessary Part of
Modern Civilization.
Springfield .Republican.
Senator Edmunds was once asked bow a
President-elect is to know that he has been
elected. "By reading the newspapers," was
the answer. It is a curious fact that no
provision of law exists for the official notifi
cation ot Major McKinley, for example, of
his election. According to the law the Vice-
President, after the returns from the elec
toral college have been canvassed, announces
to the Congress in joint session the choice
of the electors for President and Vice-Presi
dent for the ensuing term. Alter reading
in the newspaoers that he has been so hon
ored the President-elect goes to Washington
to be sworn in. Meanwhile the President
still in office is also dependent upon the
newspapers for information as to the identity
of his successor. And so President Cleveland,
Having read in the papers or in the Con
gressional Record that Major McKinley is to
be the next President, \yill call at the latter's
lodgings a day or two beiore the end of his
term to pay his respects. Finally, on the
inaugural day. Major McKinley will happen
up to the Senate chamber on the strength of
what the newspapers have told him and be
sworn In. God is not officially recognized in
the constitution, but the American Govern
ment's machinery tacitly recognizes the press
as a necessary part of modern civilization.

MUSIC AND MUSICIANS.
The Nordica-Melba-De Reszke dispute at
the Metropolitan Opera-house has been inten
sified br the engagement of Mme. Felia Lit
vinne, to take the place left vacant by Nor
dica. Mme. Litvinne is Edouard de Reszke's
6ister-in-law, and people who take Nordica's
part in the quarrel are more persistent than
ever in affirming that there was a great De
Reszke combine against the American prima
donna, and that Jean de Reszke's advice to
Melba to study the role of Brunhilde, which
Nordica coveted, was only h part of the De
Reszke machinations for ousting Nordica. A
large portion of the public seems to have
espoused Nordica's side of the quarrel, for
Jean de Reszke's reception, on his first ap
pearance this season, was marked by such
coldness that some critics alluded to it as a
frost. Jean's recent marriage has no doubt
taken away his charms, us a matinee girl's
idol, but that would scarcely account entirely
for the sudden change of attitude toward
Mme. Felia Litvinne and Mme. Nellie Melba, Nordica's Rivals.
Jiim shown by the New York public. Mme.
Litvinne does not seem to be up to Nordica's
standard, and there are rumors that Grau is
making fresh overtures to the whilom
Maine widow, but ?he could not in any case
go back to the Metropolitnn immediately, on
account of her concert engagements. Nordica
will sing ia this City some lime during
January.
Austria and Germany are preparing great

In Berlin the impetus given to music in fasti
ionnble circles by the extirnple of Emperor
William will cause the birthday to be ob
served in an original manner. The Emperor
has not disdained to give public performances
of his own compositions, so the members of his
conn have decided that it is not beneath their
dignity to perform in public, just like ordinary
play actors. It will bo an entirely new de
parture in court circles for the haughty aris
tocracy to sing and act before the populace,
but the noble squires and domes of Emperor
William's suite have decided to do it. Schu
bert's charming opera comique, ''The Ladies'
Crusade," will form the bill, nnd t'ne Countess
yon Moltke, wife of an imperial aid-de-camp,
wbo is a nephew of the famous marshal, will
be the stage manageress. The story ol "The
Ladies' Crusadu" is borrowed irom an ancient
comedy by Aristophanes, which is still played
under the title of "Lysistrata." The ladies of
the court will have to takt- the part of middle
age chatelaines, who form a trades union
against their nusbinds while those gentlemen
are absent at one of the crusades. The femi
nine combination is finally broken up by ihe
firm conduct of the husbands on their return.
The critics are preparing themselves before
hand for a good ilenl of musical suffering, for
the choruses in "The I,R<iies' Crusade" are very
ditficult for ccurt amateurs to sing.
The choir of Grace Church, on California
street, will tender a testimonial concert to W.

courtesy and zeal the members of the choir
state that while the appreciation shown by the
congregation is in itself a sufficient reward,
only the members of the choir ran realize the
extent and responsibility of the work accom
plished by the organist. One of the most suc
cessful features of the music at Grace Church
is the monthly festival, which has become an
acknowledged factor in the ecclesiastical
music in this City. The members of the choir
are: Frank Coffin, J. Edmund Jones, S. Homer

The Russian censor has forbidden any per

musical circles to hear it.
European conductors seem to be looking
more and more to Russia for new music, and
therefore a good deal of interest is felt in the
coming production of two new Russian operas.
One is by Kasatchenko, and although the title
is not yet fixed the libretto is known to be
based on life in Little Russia. The second
new opera is by P. J. Blaremberg, and is
founded ou a drama by Ostrowski entitled
'A Seventeenth Ceutury Comedian."
The University of Jena has preserved for
several hundred years a voluminous manu

photographs have been taken of every page, in
order that the old songs it contains may be

The Austrian composer, Antoine Bruckner,
was not so much made of during his lifetime,
but his death has been the signal for all sorts
of post mortem honors. A statue is to be

GIRL'S NIGHTDREES
A nightdress for little girls, which is cut on
very simp'.e lines, and yet is up to date,
recommends itself to all mothers, for it is
easily made und will please the little miss by
its picturesqueness, which is the result of the
large collar and full sleeves. The gown may
be re-enforced in yoke shape for extra strength
at the top, where the wear and tear comes.
The collar maybe neatly edged with a nar
row band of Hamburg embroidery or a frill of
narrow lace, but is in itself very effective
when made of plain white cotton cloth, ba
tiste or lawn. The neatest trimming and the
least expensive is a tiny insertion of Valen
ciennes let in, about its width from the edge of
the eoliar, with an inch wide edtce of tno lace
to match, slightly gathered. This entails a
little more labor, but repays one by its dainti
ness. The sleeves may be finished by a little
ruffle with lace and insertion to match.
Tue gown without the collar is very pretty,
ihe lull sleeves relieving its plainness.

PROFIT OUT OF
THE SEA OTTER
A Successful Shot Means
a Quarter of a Thou
sand.
Twd Men Secured Four Skins
off Yaquina Bay in Six
Weeks.
Ssveral Schooners Will Start Out
N-xt Saturday to Hunt the
S2a^s oi the Coast.
Harvey Jacobs and George Noidever are
in luck. In six weeks they have taken four
sea otters, and as the skins are worth at
least $1000, the hunters must be classed as
among "those favored by the cods." The
hunters were among the two most suc
cessful men during tiie cruise of the seai
insr schooner Herman, and on their return
pooled their issues. They hud enough
money to purchase a whalebont and fit
her out. From bere they went to Yaquina
Bay and there hired a third man to row
the boat. One day Jacobs would steer
and Neidever would do ths gunning, and
the next day it would be vice versa. Lat
terly it has been unusually rough on the
coast and tho waves have run mountains
bich. Nevertheless tbe men have gone
out day after day and on nearly every oc
casion the sea otter was shot when tbe
boat was in the trough of tbe sea and the
mammal on the crest of tbe wave. The
above picture ia drawn from a sketch sent
to John Oppenheim, the well-known
clothier, and is mnriced "a $250 shot."
Jacobs and Neidever are now eff Ya
quina Bay and they intend staying in that
vicinity lor another two months. Should
they ao as well in that time as they have
during the past six weÂ«ks there wiil be no
necessity for them m-'ikinga trip to Bering
Sea next season. Many a schooner has
spent months in tbe Arctic and never took
| an otter, but here two men go out in an
open boat and secure lour of the valuable
fur 3in less than six weeks and think
nothing of the leat.
The schooner Eppinger went out a
couple of days ago and incomine coasters
report her with fifty seal and "ail the
boats out." in consequence the Kate and
Anna and the Louisa Dare are being pjt
in commission iv a hurry and both ves
sels v;ill sail next Saturday for a cruise in
chase of seal.
The news from London ia not encour
aging, however, as according to a private
cable received yesterday s'iins are selling
at 10 per cent less than last. year. Tne
supply is not large, but then money is
ti^hi and the demand is not great. Bull
tbe sealers have confidence that McKin
i ley's administration will improve matters
ana that next year will see a big advance
in prices and a general improvement in
du si ness.
Tlie new steamer Humboldt was taken
from Third and B?rry streets to the Ful
ton Iron Works yesterday. Her new en
gines and boilers will be put in as speedily
as possible and in the meantime Ban
dixen is bere and will at once beein work
on the deckhouses and internal fittings of
the ves3el. Max Kali'h, the popular
agent of tbe Ilututioltit, says the steamer
will be ready for her trial trip early in
January.
Meat Inspector Jordan seized a whole
carcass on the steamer Tiburon yesterday.
Tbe stuff was shipped from t>an Rafael by
a prominent butcher to Tong Sing, 20
Washington alley. The smell lrom it was
*o great that the crew of ths ferry-boat
bad to put it on the after part oi the ves
sel in order to save tlie pas^eneers from
inhaling the odor. There were 705 pounds
of tlie stuff and had it not been lor the
I vigilance of Jordan tlie chances are that
some of the meat would now be gracing
j tbe counters of some of tbe cheap down
town restaurants.
Captain flansen will go out in com

sume his regular run up the coast.
The Czarina is now ready for sea. The
vessel that is to carry hou : e coal from the
Beaver Hill nnnss will probably nave her
trial trip to-morrow. In the morning she
will go into Mission Bay, and her com
passes will be adjusted. In the afternoon
she will go over the measured mile aod
wiil have a cruise around the bay. John
D. Spreckels and a party of friends will be
aboard, and the expectations are that the
collier wilt beat her own record. She has
been fitted with one of tbe new patent
corrugated wheels from which so mucn is
expected.
The steamer Wellington took a dozen

There was considerable trouble cetting
them aboard the steamer yesterday and a
couple of the longshoremen will not forget
the experience in a hurry. One got a
rather s?vere kick and the other had a
mouthful taken out of tbe slack of his
pants. The animals were not put in boxes,
but were- turned loose in the hold of tbe
ship ar.d thf>re they will have to shift for
themselves until the thip ieaches British
Columbia.
Cap:ain Backus left iast night to bring
! the bark Coiu.ia from Puget Sound to San
Francisco. She was to load coal for John
Rosenfeld's sons, but as the vessel was
leaking Captain Kalb refused to take tha
risk of bringing her to this port with a
load of coal. Captain Backus was at work
transforming the Eastern Oregon from
a steamer into a four-masted barkentine,
j but he at once quit the job and started
I last night for Port Townsend. On hissr
! rival he will assume command of the
Colusa, and will load her with coal for
San Francisco. The Co.usa took a cargo
of sugar from Hawaii to the sound.

A LADY'S BONANZA
IN SNOWY OREGON
M. T. Ward Sued Because
He Failed to Develop
a Mine.
Sharp Words Used by the Plain
tiff in Describing Her
Wrcngs.
Mrs. Elizabeth J. Fianican Denounces
a Contractor as "a Schemer >
and a Rojm."
Elizabeth J. Finnican, by her attorney,
J. In. E. Wilson, has sued Michael T.
Ward for an annulment of contract by
which he holds possession of a certain
valuable gold-mining claim known as the
Bohemia lode in the mountains of
Douglas County, Oregon.
The claim is Ihe separate property of
Mrs. Finnican, the same having been
located and posted by her according to
the local mining regulations and the
United States mininn laws. Her husband,
James P. Finnican. is named as co
plain tiff as being a party in interest.
Mrs. Finnican speaks her mind very
freely in her complaint, and docs not
mince her words or disguise her senti
ments in the slightest degree when de
nouncing the author of her troubles. She
accuses Ward of fraudulently retaining
possession of the property contrary to her
desire, thouzh he lias failed to keep any of
his promises in regard to the development
of the mine.
As a basis for the suit a contract is set
out in whicn it is agreed byjkirs. Finni
can that in consideration of $1 Ward
shall for ten years have the exclusive
privilege to operate and crush the ores
from the Bohemian lode, and he is to pay
Mrs. Finnican 25 per cent of the gross
proceeds of the mine. On his part it is
aireed that he shall sink shafts and run
such tunnels, cuts, slopes and winzes as
may be necsssary to develop the property.
He is also to erect tbe buildings and to
put up the machinery required tor the
operations in cont^mp'ation, it being
understood that Ward was a man of
menus and experience and that he could
secure all the backing needed by big capi
talist*.
Mrs. Finnican and her husband aver
that since tbe making of tbe contract
they have discovered that all the repre
sentations made by Ward are false and
fraudulent and known by him 30 to be;
that he induced them to enter into the
agreement with him for speculative pur
poses only, well knowing that in no re
spect could he fu fill any part of bis agree
ment; that in truth he bud no experience
as a mining man; that he did not employ
any one to work or develop the mine, and
that he was not worth $500,000 or any sum
of money whatever.
The further charge is made that Ward
had no backing by wealthy men ot Chicago
or elsewhere, and that he never intended
to erfct any machinery for the purposa of
working the ore.
It is stated in the complaint that, al
though tbe snow melted from the moun
tains of Douglas County. Or., in May,
1896, and the condition of the property
was such that Ward cou.d have pro
ceeded with any prospecting or deveioTj
intr work he mi 'bt choose to do, yet he
did no such work and never intended to.
The most bitter allegation is near the
close of the complaint, when the follow
ing words are used : "It has come to the
knowledee of these plaintiffs since said
contract wns entered into that tbo said
Ward is nothing more nor less than a
tcbem<>r and a rogue, who induced these
plaintiffs to enter into said contract that
he might use sÂ»id agreement and contract
upon innocent third parties, not for the
purposes for which the contract was made,
but to further his own selfish and criminal
ends."
Judgment is demanded lo the effectthat
the contract be declared null and void;
that Ward be compelled to surrender pos
session of the original contract for cancel
lation, and that he be compelled to pay
the costs of suit, and for such other relief
as may be jusv in tbe premises.
A TRAVELING EXPOSITION.
Novel Schctnei Submitted to the State
Fiixrtl of Trade.
At the State Board of Trade meeting on
Tuesday afternoon various matters of in
terest to the State were considered, among
them the request of the fruit-growers of
Porterville for the loan of 100 exhibition
jai-3 for use at the coming Fresno fair. It
was understood that at the close of tbe
fair tbe jars and their contents should be
forwarded to San Francisco and placed
among the exhibits of the board.
The Doard was favorable to the proposi
tion, but a difficulty was found in the fact
that not more than a dozen jars are now
available for the purpose in view. Noth
ing definite, therefore, could be done at
the time.
A proposition was made to get the
Legislature at its coming session so to
amend the county government till as to
fix tbe maximum sum which may be spent
annually for advertising purposes in coun
ties of the first, second, tliird and fourth
class at $5000 insiead of the present figure,
which is $2500, and in all other counties at
$2003. instead of $1000, the present figure.
On motion, Colonel John P. Irish was
empowered to represent tbe board at tbe
Business Men's Conference at Indianapo
lis, January 12, 1897. Irish's selection was
regarded as opportune, as he is going East
acout that time, anyway.
Tho committee appointed at the last
meeting of tbe board to investigate the
possibilities of tobacco culture in Cali
fornia formally submitted its report,
which has already been published in full
in The Call.
Mr. Gilnian of Boston, who hns a
scheme to form a' train of psrhap? fiffv
cars laden with the products of every
State in the Union, and run it all over the
country as a sort of itinerant exposition,
was granted a hearing. He said each
State could have one car and that he had
made arrangements with the Pullman
Company for such cars as would be neces
sary at $2000 each.
Oilman s>tnte>l further that he intended
to carry livestock, which would be exhib
ited in the open air at stations where the
cars stopped. He would charge an admit
tance fee, and from tbe profits derived at
the end of a year or so, buy tbe cars and
the exhibits from the respective States
and conduct tbo show in his own Dbalf.
The scheme met with favor, but the
board could not see its way to taking im
mediate action, on account of the time
they require to make proper representa
tion at the Nnslmllu, Guatemala und
Hamburg expositions.
UNION LEAGUE CLUB.

more ample and desirable whs discussed |
at the meeting Tuesday evening. The 1

point a committee tn lOOK ;or suitable j

TWO MURDER CASES.
A. Mitchell and Arthur Jackson on Tr:al i
for Their Lives.
Two murder trials will be closed in the '
Superior Court to-day, and it is expected !
that verdictsjwill be reached in both oases
before to-morrow morning.
Joseph A. Mitchell, charged with the
murder of K. T. Hicks, is having the ques
tion of his. guilt or innocence investigated
in Judt'C Itahrs' court. He testified in his
own behalf yesterday. He admitted the
killing, and said that he acted in self
defense; that Hicks frequently assau'ted
him, at one time knocking him down
with a pair of brass knncklt s. The
Deputy District Attorney opened the ar

A PUBLIC VIEW
IN PRIVATE ROOMS
Peculiar Decision of the
HangiDg Committee of
the Art Institute.
A Picture Rejected Because It
Had B3cn Exhibited at the
Bohemian Club.
i D : sgust Over a Ru'.ing Which Classes
a Club Funcliou as a Public
Affair.
j Clubdom haÂ° received sometb ing of a sur-
I prise at the recent decision of the hanging
committee of the Art Association as to
just what is a club exhibition.
Chris Jorgensen had a picture in which
he had put his heart, and called it "Ban
Lomond"â a very pretty thing, acknowl
edged to b.Â» well within all the es-entials
as to merit. But it was not accepted, does
not hang in good or bad light, lugti or low,
I on the line or off, anywhere upon the walls
iof the institute. Instead, Mr. JorgeiisÂ«n
was in receipt of one of those little notes
I from the committee advising him of its
i rejection and asking what disposition
; might be made of it.
The reason given in this case, however,
' has stirred up a row among more people
i than the immediate friends of Jorgensen.
The rule of this exhibition is thit all
i works of art offered must come there as
; wholly new to the public â must never 1
: hnvo been publicly exhibited beforo.
Now, Mr. Jorgonsen's '"Ben Lomond"
: had hung upon the walls cf tue Be-
I hemh.n Club, together with a few
! of the worKs of o.her local artists, which
had been taken there at the express wish
of certain of the Bohemians, and, being
there, tbe Bohemians had sent out
cards of invitation to other Bohemians,
members of the club and otherwise, to
1 come and enjoy it. For a time the picture
( was thus on view within the sacred pre-
I cincts of the club.
The ranging committee, for this, de
i clared that Jorgensen's picture offended,
; according to the law forbidding pictures
! previously exhibited to the public, and
I th<Â» committeemen declined to hang it.
For this Mr. Jorgensen complains, and
â  so do the members of the art committee of
the Bohemian Club. Horacs G. Platt.
once president of the institute and now
1 ciinirmAii of this committee of the Bo
j hemian Club, especially denounces the
1 decision as unjust. It is particularly
I shocking to clubmen to have it said that
j an exhibition within tbe club is a public
! exhibition. That is enough to set a Bo
' hemian Club man's teeth on edge. Mr.
j Piatt says that he considered the pictures
j in the hands of the club as merely having
j been loaned to friends. He i-* very sorry
that the act of courtesy on Jorgensen's
part should have resulted in barring his
picture out of ths institute, but he is
shocked beyond measure at the ruling of
tne institute that a club function is a
public affair. The ruling will probably
be resisted.

Justice Harrison Defines the Law
for the Supreme
Court
Eizabeth Ro.-gers, Formerly Mrs.
Montgormry, Owes N t'r'n; for
Marriage Brckerag?.
"The freedom of choice essential to a
happy marriage, and the voluntary selec
tion by each spouse of the person who is
to be his companion for life, with all that
is implied in the relation of marriage, are
as fully prevented by seeking, through the
influence of one who is governed solely by
mercenary motives, to induce one of the
parties to an agreement for marriage to
carry it into effect, il he has once been
disposed to abandon it, as to endeavor to
bring about such an agreement between
parties who do not sustain any relation to
each other."
In these emphatic words the Supreme
Court has just placed itsVf on record con
cerning the manner in which matrimony
should come about. The case was that of
Kitty Morrison against Elizabeth A.
Rodgers and Arthur Rodgers. The real
defendant was Elizabeth A. Rodgers, wife
of Arthur Rodgers. Kitty Morrison
brought a suit to recover a certain sum of
money from Elizabeth A. Rodgers. on the
allegation that Mrs. Rodgers had promised
to pay her this sum if she would use her
influence to secure her marriage to Alex
ander Montgomery, her first husband.
The complaint aiso sets uv that the plain
tiff worked to bring about tlie wedding,
and. that she was instrumental therein.
The marriage took place, but, according
to the allegation, the defendant failed to
keep her promise, and has not* paid the
moiiey which she agreed to pay.
The Supreme Court took the ground
yesterdcy, in affirming ;he judgment to
which Kitty Morrison demurred, that the
rule thflt a marriage brokerage contract is
invalid is an elementary proposition.
"The ruie that a marriage brokerage
contract is invalid," so reads the opinion
by Justice Harrison, "as being contrary to
public policy, and that the services ren
dered under such contract are without
legal consideration and are incapable of
forming the foundation of an action for
their recovery, is so elementary that but
very lew cases involving tlie question
have found their way into the leportel
decisions, but whenever the question lias
been presented Ihe courts have invariably
declared that the action could not be
maintained."
The court couid not distincuish any
difference between the case in question
and those in which the rule has been laid
down. The fact that in this case there

between the parties, and that the agree
ment with the defendant was only ior the
purpose of promoting the carrying out of
that agreement, was not found to be suffi
cient to take the case out of the rule.
"The basis of the agreement," so rends
the opinion further on, '"with the plaintiff
in the prese.nt case is aileced to be the fact
that tiie defendant became apprehensive
that the person wlio hail agreed to marry
her would not keep his agreement, and it
was for the purpose of inducing him to
forego whatever nurpoae ho had to aban
don such contemplated marriage that tha
plaintiff rendered tlie services for which
the action is brought.

between services rendered under such an
employment and those rendered for the
purpose of inducing one to nnrry another
whom he did not. previously know."

AS
Swagger and swell and quite English
from roof to dome was the opening of
S:m Francisco's third annual hors9 show
yesterday at the Mechanics' Pavilion.
Everybody who claims to be anybody in
society or in the circles of the professions,
tm-iness or retired capitalists was there,
particularly in the evening. That is when
the horse show looked its best and was at
its best.
Tne tanbarked inclosure formed a typi
cal arena, and there was just enough of
the tanbark arena about it to call the at
tention of another sense than the eyes
that a horse show was on. The costumes
of the officials of the ring, the grooms and
attendants were decidedly English, and
this was even so of the wave and crack of
the whips.
In the afternoon the real blast and blare
of the trumpet began, and the horses
jurnpid into the arena for judgment. The
machinery of the horse show worked a
little out of joint at first, in ttiat tne sev
eral classes did not respond as promptly
as they should to the trumpet call, but
hitches of this kind are likely to occur on
first days at a horse show a# they are on
tirst nights at a theater.
The attendance was not larse in the
forenoon. The attractions then were a
parade of various classes In the arena, in
cluding some very stylish four-in-hands,
and this, as a matter of fact, is really one
of the most attractive features of tiie show.
In a word it is ail the horses on dress
parade. This was the special delight of
the millionaire norse-fancier, who likes
show as well as speed.
Ladies and children were largely in evi
dence in the afternoon in the boxes.
Racetrack people were also sprinkled
through the crowd. But it was not
till evening that "everybody" was
there. The scene was a brilliant one.
The boxes were crowded with people in
evening ureas, by far the greater number
be ins; ladies. Many of the toilettes were
very stylish and beautiiul, and in the
beauty of the feminine occupants of the
boxes it cannot be said that San Fran
cisco is one tint or color behind New
i'orfc.
The promenade between the boxes and
the arena is somewhat narrow, particu
larly for the use of ladies, and it was
crowded during the entire evening. In
the center, below the grand tier of ooxes,
is the arena, with its tanbark floor. All
eevnne iong it was a scene of prancing
horses, tandem carts, platform traps,
hackney and Tilbury gigs, coupes, phae
tons, carriages' and nearly every other de
scription of vehicle.
The boxes were occupied much earlier
than has been the rule. The carriages be
pan to arrive at the main entrance early,
and by 9 o'clock the show in the boxes
was in fall swing, as were the exhibitions
in the rine. Buriingame was well repre
sented.
The swagger set did not se* Walter S.
Hobari's New York prize team iuT-cartor
phaeton for park use win the white riobon
in the afternoon, while the blue went to
George A. Pope's crack team, Arlington
anu Arsenal, a pair of crack chestnut
geldings of great style.
It will be remembered that among the
other noble steeds Mr. Hobart purchased
at the New York horse show for tne pur
pose of overcoming the San Francisco horse
Biiow were The Czar and The Sultan,
two very stylish bay geldings, for which,
according to the telegraph, the types and
proof-readers of San Francisco newspa
pers, he paid $40,000. Several gentlemen
of the ultra swagser set were found
in the promenade yesterday after
noon who averred that the types
made an inconsequential error of
$36,000 in the cost of The Tzar and
Tie Sultan, and that it should have read
$4000 instead of $40,000. Anyhow, this
was the first appearance of these noted
steeds, and when Mr. Hobart, a little late,
but driving the beautiful bays himself,
entered the arena there were many who
looked upon him as the "young Lochin
vÂ»r who came out of the West." Certainly
this team made a great impression. It
was its first appearance and clearly the
event of the afternoon. The Czar and The
Saltan trotted tot-ether as prettl'y as any
two steeds ever stepped.
If horses can really be said to possess
style of their own, theirs was very stylish
yet dignified. Evidently these prize
beauties, which were reported to . have
taken the first piize in New York, felt
their oals and t eir prestige. Mr. Hj
bart's face was unexpressive, though he,
of course, knew that all eyes were on his
pair.
The other entries in this class also made
a very superior appearance ana impres
sion. Messrs. Rives and Carman, the
judges, assumed a very serious expression
of countenance as the six teams in this
class, No. 50, pranced around the ring.
It was apparent that the contest might be
Two of Pope's Equine Pets.
close, and so it proved. One of the judges
ascended to the box of Mr. Pope's crack
team, Arlington and Arsenal, and drove
them several times around the ring.
Then he did the same with Mr. Ho
bart's other entry in this class, D:imrosch
and Seidl, a pair of bays. The blue rib
bon, first prize, was tied to Arlington and
Arsenal (the Pope crack team), and there
was much applause. Mr. Hobart visibly
reddened, but was otherwise impassive.
Then the red, second prize, was pinned
J to Damrosch and Seidl, and Mr. Hobart's
expression of countenance was a puzzle.
The white, or third premium, was
attached to the New York prize beauties,
and the yellow, and fourth, to Mr. Pope's
Sweetheart and Surprise. ArlinL'ton and
Arsenal, very handsome chestnuts that
t ey are, seemed to feel the honor and
distinction. Arlington reared into the
air. Arsenal pawed the tan bark first with
one foot and then the other, and with a
bound they started around the arena on
the customary circle of exhibition.
Mr. Hobart did not wait to parade The
Czar and The Sultan continuously with the
other prize winners. He drove off the tan
bark into the stable 3.
R chard Graham officiated as ringmaster,
as he did last year. The judges who will
act during the week are:
James B. Ferguson and R. Van Brunt
will judge thoroughbreds; A. B. Spreckels,
R. N. Graves and Green B. Morris, trot

admired by a crowd of people.
The horse show will continue through
the week, ending Saturday night. The
programme for to-day ij perhaps longer
than yesterday, and fully as attractive.
It includes roadsters, pacers, saddle
horses, horses in harness, six-in-band
driving, saddle-ponies, parade of horses
for exhibition only, unicorn teams,

horses, fire engine teams, jumping ponies,

evening.
LAUNCHED ON THE
TAN WITH A LUNCH.
The proceedings during the forenoon
opened at 10 o'ciock with a grand ring
parade, under the supervision of the ring
master. The ring committee for the day
was composed of Major J. L. Rathbone
and J. B. Crockett. The attendance of
spectators, occupying boxe3 and prome
nading outside the inclosure, was not
quite so large as might have been antici
pated, but the throng continually in
creased with the lapse of time and a very
respectable average was maintained
throughout the afternoon. But as yet the
galaxy of human female beauty had failed
to distract more than casually the atten
tion of the male portion of the spectators
from the equine display within the rine.
Many handsome animals scattered the
tanbark yesterday morning, and the keen
rivalry of the various exhibitors was
plainly manifested by the absorbed man
ner in which they put their four-fooled
charges through their paces. Nor is it too
much to add that this fientiment seemed
to be shared by the animals themselves,
which certainly must have realized that
they were the cynosure of all eyes.
Mr?. J. G. Boyne's bay gelding pony,
King Billy, most gracefully ridden by the
owner's little daughter, Miss Mildred
Boyne, scored an instantaneous triumph.
The pretty equestrienne, suitably arrayed
in riding co-turne and wearing neat
leather leggings, made a veritable picture
and was loudly applaud'd as she made
the circuit of the ring. Mrs. Farnsworth
also made her debut mounted upon her
pretty mare Stella. George A. Pope ex
hibited for the first time a new team,
composed of Sweetheart, a bay mare, and
Surprise, a bay gelding, and his handsome
chestnut, Romulus, also made his initial
appearance and was approved by even
the hypercritical.
At 11 o'clock precisely C. A. Baldwin
created a mild sensation as he drove into
the inclosure his celebrated four-in-hand
team, comprising those beautiful speci
mens of horseflesh, Ruth, Demon, Downey
and His Lordship. The only feature of
the turnout which -xcited adverse com
ment was the jehu'3 costume. Thi* in
cluded a gray jacket and a straw hat,
which the initiated declared were not ex
actly "the thing," you know. However,
Mr. Baldwin showed himself irreproach
able as a driver. He passed through the
posts without touching them.
President Crocker's coach, with that
gentleman on the box, and Walter S. Ho
bart manipulating the ribbons, was the
next to enter. After the latter hal given
a brief display of his skill Mr. Crocker
took the reins and gave a highly creditable
exhibition, albeit he knocked down a sin
gle post.
Joseph D. Grant followed with his four
in-handâ Music, Minstrel, Myrtle and
Madene â all gray mares attached to a very
tin de siecle break of the most approved
pattern. That break, however, was the
only one discernible throughout His per
formance, which was in pvery respect ad
mirable. Mr. Bennett subsequently toot
the reins and showed to a wondering world
how they did it in England, and truth to
tell if they all do it like Mr. Bennett they
do it very well indeed.
The last lour of the forenoon wns de
voted to ring practice of horses entered
in the jumping classes â some thirty in
number. They include animals of all
shapes and sizes, big and little, fat and
lean. Occasionally the jumping qualities
of the equine competitors was in inverse
proportion to their avoirdupois, and the
"sticks" never phased them. Mr. Hobart
has several handsome entries in this
class, as, f..r example. Merry Boy, flnn:
res 1 * and Lady Greensleeves. Blairheart,
better known as "Jerry," a brown peld
ing, a grandson of the famous English
horse Blair Attaol, belied his ancestry and
si owed a marked disinclination to exert
himself.
The inaugural luncheon at midday
given by the board of directors of the as
sociation was informal in character, and
the guests wasted no time whatever in
oratory. The proceedings of the forenoon
had evidently given one and all a keen
appetite, and more than justice was ac
cordid to the ample menu provided by
a thoughtful commissariat.
Over three hundred guests were spe
cially invited, and of this number more
than two hundred responded. Governor
Budd was, of course, the guest of honor,
though President Crocker presided, the
chief executive occupying a seat on his
right hand, further supported by his
staff, composed of the following: Colonels
Peeler, Burgen, A. Andrews, Herbert
Choynski, Frank Vail, Young, Bush,
Pippy, Sanborn and Captain F. de L. Car
rington, U. S. N.
George Aimer Newhall of the board of
directors did the honors, which did not
prove exacting. The majority of those
present, including President Crocker him
self, were rather surprised that no local
Demosthenes aspired to air his eloquence
on an occasion so auspicious. Many ex
pected that the Governor would say a few
words, but he, it is understood, disclaimed
expert knowledge of horseflesh and feared
to commit himself beyond hope of recov
ery in the presence of so critical an audi
ence.

THOROUGHBREDS PACE
IN THE AFTERNOON.
A very handsome lot of thoroughbred
stallions, class 1, were those which pa
rsded on the tanbark about 2 o'clock in the
afternoon. They came prancing through
the gates at the sound of the trumpets and
all eyes were turned that way. Among
them was the thoroughbred stallion Isliug
ton, owned by James R. Robinson of Han
ford, which is entered among the special
exhibits. A proud set were these male
prancers. Every hair was in line, and the
fetlocks and hoofs shone like their bur
nished coats. Their necks were curved
and their steps high. It required no sec
ond glance, even of a novice, to see they
were thoroughbreds, marrow and bone.
The list comprised Burns & Waterhouse's
chestnut Lovdale, A. B. Spreck-ls' chest
nut imp. Creighton ; the chestnut Crescen
do, belonging to J. Naglee Burke of San
Jose; the imp. Artillery, owned by W. T.
Parsons of New Zealand, and J. B. Hag
gins' Del Paso 11.
Then came another parade of trotting
stallions, comprising about a dozen, in
classes 5, 6 and 7. A special prize of a
silver cup, valued at $200, is offered by
Shreve & Co. for class 5, which is stallions
four years old and over kept for service,
in addition to the regular prizes. These
stallions made fully as creditable and
stylish appearance as those of the previous
class. This concluded the preliminary
parading of the afternoon and the judges
eot down to business.
The first class to be judged was 38, mare
or geldin , 15 hands and under 15
handd 2 inches, suitable for park use in
a gig or phaeton, the winner of hrst prize
being barred from taking a pr ze in classes
33 and 35. There were four entries:
George A. Pope's bay eelding Romulus,
W. S. H ibart's chestnut mare Friils (with
Mr. Hobart holding the ribbons), Mr. Ho
bart's bay mare Pride, and Mr. Hobari's
bay gelding The Bid, he making three of
the four entries in the class. The stylish
gigs glistened with new varnish and were
radiant in their upholstery. Applause
followed t c pinning of tho blue to PriJe.
Frills took the red ribbon, The Sid the
white, and Mr. Pope's Romulus the yel
low ribbon. It could not have been much
otherwise, but Mr. Hobart looked pleased
with three out of four prizes, and bis
friends thou ht be started out very well
in the first day.
The ponies had their innings next. They
were very pretty; pairs in harness to
phaetons or carts. This class, 63, in
cluded pairs of stallions, mares or geld
ings, or mare and gelding, 12 hands and
not exceeding 13 hands 1 inch. W. S.
Hobart made the only two entries: Imp.
Spot, a skewbald mare, and Lightfoot, a
piebald gelding, which were driven by
him, and the Spotted Dip and Spotted
Sparkle. The ponies were of special in
terest to the children and ladies, the little
ones clapping their hands and crying
out their delight. Three prizes were
hung up but only one was awarded â the
first prize of $60 to imp. Spot and Light
foot. Dip and Sparkle trotted away with
out a premium. The children said, "Too
bad," for Dip and Sparkle were very pretty
indeed. The judges evidently thought
that Dip and Sparkle did not come up to
the standard of second-prize beauties or
they hesitated about giving all the prizes
in the show, right away, to young Mr.
Hobart. His steeds hau been nearly the
w o!e show so far.
The gigs and the phaetons looked
awfully small in class 64. This was for
stallions, mares or geldings above 13
hands 1 inch and not exceeding 14 hands 1
inch, three years old and over. In this
clast "there were others." Wakefield
Baker entered his bay stallion Tommy,
Baldwin his bay gelding Tristan, Mrs. C.
H. Lead tetter Jr. a roan mare, Lady Raye,
and W. S. Hobart a bay gelding, Button B.
Mr. Hobart again had the satisfaction of
seeing the blue pinned to the throat
latch of Button, and perhaps greater ex
ultation in watching the third-rate wkite
tied to his cousin Baldwin's Tristan, for
society is well aware that the cousins are
far from being as thick as two in a bed
and three in the middle, and thnt they
look upon each otner with frowning
brows.
They don't speak as they pass by, even
on the tanbark of a horse show. Lady
Raye trotted around the arena with the
red fluttering from her temple. The bsy
stallion Tommy took fourth prize.
At 3:20 o'clock the trumpet sounded for
saddle horses, class 67, mare or gelding,
15 bands and under 15 hands 2
inches, four years old or over, up to carry
ing 160 pounds. The entries were John
Parrott's brown mare Mousie, George
Quarries chestnut mare Czarina, J. J.
Moore's black, maro Topsy, Lnon Bcque
raz's chestnut gelding Norval and Mr*
Hobart's The Sid. The horses bounded
into the arena and were much admired
for their movement and style. Mousie
took first prize and Czarina third, no other
prizes being awarded.
The next was one of the most important
events of the opening dayâ class 40, horses
in harness, pairs of meres or geldings, 15
'bands high or over, for pars use in T cart
or phaeton, the pair taking first prize
barred from taking a prize in classes 34,
37 and 42. These teams and outfits were,
perhaps, the swellest of the day. The sil
ver chains of the harness jingled a pleas
ant music to tho motion of the trotters,
and the goid or silver mounted harness
glittered in the rays of the sun that
slanted from the upper windows. The en
tries were: Henry J. Crocker's chestnut
gelding Fred and c estnut mare Elea
nor; George A. Pope's bay mare Sweet
heart and bay gelding Surprise; Mr.
Pope's chestnut geldings Arlington an ill
Arsenal; W. S. Hobart's gray and broffuÂ§
eeldings Peacock and Paragon; Mr. Ho-,1
barts bay geldings Damroscb and Seidl;
Mr. Hobart's bay geldings The Czar and
The Sultan, which he purchased at there
cent New York horse show for special ex
hibition here.
These teams were all well matched, and
it was apparent from the studious looks on
the faces of Judges Rives and Carman, as
the handsome turnouts trotted around the
circle and described other evolutions in
the arena, that they considered they had
gome work to perform. Mr. Hobart held
t*ie reins over The Czar and The Sultan.
These are certainly magnificent horses.
Mr. Hobart's face was almost impassive.
Nearly an hour was consumed in passing
upon this class, amid the greatest interest
on the part of society people and all
others present. At first it appeared that
Tlie Czar and The Sultan would win first
prize, but it was not to be.
The blue went to Mr. Pope's crack team,
Arlington and Arsenal ; the red to Mr.
Hobart's Damrosch and Seidi; third prize
to the New York prize-winners, The Czar
and The Sultan, and lourth to Mr. Pope's
Sweetheart and Surprise, two prizes each
for the leading competitors. There was
feeble applause. Mr. Hobart flushed and
did not stay to parade in the arena with
the other prize-winners.
In class 79, stallion not exceeding 46
inches in h ight, not length, Prince Al
bert, a bay, owned by Thomas G. KlinK,
was the only entry. He was awarded first
prize.
Class 76, stallion three years old or over,
exceeding 12 hands 1 inch and not exceed
ing 14 hands 1 inch, the only entry waa
the bay stallion Tommy, owned by Wake
held Baker. He took a b.'ue ribbon.
Tne next, class 20, was one of a numer
ous and a sort of a proud amily showing.
It was for stallions, four years old or over,
with three of his get of any ace. The en
tries were imp. Green's Rufus, exhibited bS"W
John Parrott, and imp. Paragon, a chest- 7
nut, exhibited by F. G. Berry of Fresno.
They took first and second prizes respect
ively. The array of equine children was
very frisky and a credit to their sires.
The only entry in class 2l, stallions, four
years old or over, was John Parrott's imp.
G-een's Rufus, a chestnut, which ieit the
vigor of every ounce of blood under his
beautiful coat. He showed it, too, in nis
arched neck and graceful cavorting. He
took another first prise and seemed to feel
his doubie honors in the prancing he in
dulged in with' a second blue ribbon flat
tering from his tern vies.
W. S. Hobart's Frills, in class 28, for
colts, fillies or geldings two years old, the
only entry, took another blue ribbon.
All Baba, John Parrott's brown colt, in
class 29 for year ing?, and the only entry,
took a second prize, no first being awarded.
In class 29 A, 3 and under 5 years old,
there were eight entries, but none came
up to the standard of a first prize. The
entries were: F. G. , Berry's bay mare
Maud, Mr. Berry's bay gelding Dave, Mr.
Berry's bay mare Maybelle, bay gelding
Colonel, chestnut gelding Ginger ana
chestnut mare Lady, the chestnut mare
Hattie, owned by N." G. Kittle of Fresno,
and the chestnut mare Maty, same owner.
They looted well. Lady took the blue,
Mary the white ribbon and Ginger the
yellow color or fourth prize

75Q Mission St.chiffons, embroideries, rare laces beyond
price and yellow with age, rustling silks
and furs, martin, sable, mink, ermine,
little heads with shining jeweled eye-< and
long.sott or bristling tails were among the
many accessories that went to make the
toilets ot the gorgeously gowned multi
tude at the horse show. There were all
styifs and conditions of eowns from the
severe yet elegant street dress to the swell
iuli evening or reception gown.
Jewels were worn in abundance. Dia
monds flashed in tiny ears and even glit
tered on corsages or the neart of a rose on
some swe\l bonnet. But decollete gowns
there were none. Not even a suspici' not
a tiny V to lay bare some sott white
rounded throat.
The hats and bonnets were as different
as it is possible for bonnets and hats to be
and still permit the fashionable modiste
to feel entitled to a reasonable amount of
self-respect.
No rules governed the wearers. Matrons
wore hats or bonnets, as taste or inclina
tion prompted, and the buds and belles
adopted the same satisfactory rules. In
the promenades the gay bright eowns
were hid under the folds of rich mantels
of veivet, with jeweled or jet trimmings or
sade, mink or ermine cap?, embellished
with various heads and tails.
. Below will be found a review of a few of
the many handsome gowns worn b3 r so

UNDER THE ARC-LIGHTS,
Promptly at 8 p. m. after recess the ring
master, judges and rinif committee, the
latter composed of Messrs. J. A. Dono

to carry weight specified in special class.
I The paces included walk, trot and canter.
A field of twelve competed for three prizes,

by Charles Goodall; Haunaui, black mare,
16, 4 years, exhibited by Mrs. Fannie

Hobart, ban Mateo; Merry Boy, bay geld
ing, 15.2, 5 years, exhibited by W. S.
Hobart.
The contest for first place almost from
the outset wes between Huntress and
Gypsy Queen. The former is a beautiful
and spirited animal and her action, as she
gracemly encircled ihe ring, was uni
versally admired and applauded- J.
Rockett, who enjoyed the honor of riding
| her, acquitted himself admirably and
looked proud indeed when the mucli
coveted blue ribbon was attached to the
glossy neck of his valuable charge.
Mr. Pope's Gypsy Quean, a scarcely less
beautiiul black mare, sired by Profit
Wilkea, won t c second prize, with Dr.
Payne's Bintram thud and H. J. Crock
er's Dorothy fourth. The judges of this
tvent were Messrs. R. Vau Brunt and
Ricnard F. Carman.
Class 34 followed the above, under which
head were exhibited ladies' horses, 14.1 to
15 hands, shown be. ore carriages suitable
for a lady to drive. Ihe entries were as
follows, two being allotted to each
team: Ned, brown gelding, 15.0>^,
and Jim, brown gelding, 15.0%, ex

ding, 15, five years, exhibited
by George A. Pope; Pride, bay
gelding, 15, five year, and Prejudice,
bay gelding, 15, 5 years, exhibited by W.
S. Hobart. There was not one amonÂ» the
foregoing turnouts that did not deserve
commendation and the judgesâ Messrs.
R. W. R.ves and R. F. Carman â were con
scientiously able to award a prize to each.
As usual Mr. Hobart secured a first with
Pride and Prejudice, Mr. Pope's Romulus
and Remas came second, W. T. Scott's
Ned and Jim third, and Mrs. Burkes
Jeffe and Wow fourth.
The display of carriage horses under
class 48, specially designed for horses bred
on the Pacific Coast, was among the most
interesting events of 'the evening ana
served to show to splendid advantage the
magnificent quality of California horse
flesh more particularly.
The entries, however, were compara
tively few. Henry J. Crocker himself
drove his bay mare Dorothy an<l a ripple
of applause ran around the Pavilion as he
entered the in closure. The other entries
were Crocker's Prince, a five-year-old geld
ing, and E. D. McSweeney's bay Eeldinjr,
Baldy.
Prizes were awarded as follow*: Mr
Crocker's bay mare Dorothy first, the
same gentleman's Prince second and Mr.
McSweeney's Baldy third. The judges
were R. W. Rived and R. F. Carman.
Under class 39 were exhibited mares
and geldings with gigs and phaetons.
The entries were: Dandy, bay elding,
16, 8 years, exhibited by John Parrott,
San Matio; Edie. gray mare, 15.2, 7 years,
exhibited by F. H., Burke, La Siesta
Ranch; Sweetheart, bay mare, 15.3%, 6
years, exhibited by George A.
Pope; Peacock, cray gelding, 15.2,
exhibited by W. S. Hobart;
Paragon, brown gelding. 15.2, 5 years,
exhibited by W. 8. Hobart; Madison
Square, brown gelding, 15.31Â£, six years,
exhibited by W. S. Hobart; The Czar,
gray gelding, 15.3, exhibited by W. S. Ho
bart; Fred, bay gelding, 16.2, six years,
exhibited by Charles F. Hanlon. Mr. Ho
bart himself drove Madison Square, but
the fortunate first - prize winner the
proved to be his brown gelding Paragon,
which had a formidable rival in Mr. Pope's
bay mare Sweetheart, the latter being
second.
The other prize-winners were Mr. Ho
bart's Czar, third, and his gray gelding,
Peacock, fourth. The judges were as
before.
One of the greatest displays of the day
and probably of the entire show came
under the head of class 57, for four-in-hand
road teams shown before coach or body
break.
The hero of the hour was undoubtedly
H. J. Crocker, who drove behind Edwin,
Edgnr, Prince and Dorothy. It would be
difficult to imagine a finer spectacle in its
way than that presented by this superb
turnout. Everything was complete down
to the smallest details, even to the two im
ported groomsâ if they are no more than
a detailâ who sat in the rear of the coach
and from that point of vantage viewed the
proceedings with Anglo-Saxon stolidity.
Charles A. Baldwin's Ruth, Demon,
Downey and His Lordship followed the
above for second place, with J. D. Grant's
Music, Minstrel, Myrtle and Madre third,
and an unnamed four-in-hand, entered by
Mr. Hobart and composed of three bay
geldings and one gray ditto, fourth.
Mr. Hobart was not so successful in this
class as heretofore, and another four-in
hand of his, which also participated, was
not heard of when the judges made their
awards.
last, but by no means least on the pro
gramme was the display of jumpers under
class 81. This was entirely the most ex
citing feature of the evening, the element
of danger, inseparable therefrom, adding
zest to the spectacle. The first competitor
to put in an appearance w is Mr. Hobart's
microscopical Welsh p^ny Tadpole, ridden
by an almost equally diminutive jockey
known as "Bobby" Idal, a clever young
horseman employed by Mr. Hobart to ex
ercise his horses.
Tadpole is scarcely 10 hands high, and
is probably without a duplicate in Cali
fornia. His debut was the signal for every
lady in the Pavilion to rise in her seat,
and the customary feminine expressions
of admiration were heard on all sides.
But, though microsc >pical, Tadpole
was game, and he went for his first hurdle
with more valor than discretion, the
result being a spill for both rider and
pony.
He did better the next time, however,
and after a very interesting exhibition of
rapid cantering retired amid enthusiastic
applause. The more serious portion of
the entertainment followed, a field of
twelve competing for three prizes. W.
Wirthle's Button made the first attempt,
and did fairiy well. W. D. Randall's
luaho Chief, a handsome bay stallion, was
ridden by Hermann Mass, who is ac
counted one of the best horsemen in the
State.
This fact, however, did not save him
from a nasty spill, which might have re
Â«ulted seriously. As it was he escaped
with a severe shaking. Nothing daunted
by this failure, he pluckily repeated the
attempt and cleared the bar without touch
ing. Charles A. Neave rode his brown
gelding Bobs, a 15.2}-Â£, six-year-old, and
proved that his mount was not afraid of
the hurdles. But Mr. Hobart in person
was once again the hero of the occasion.
His first jump on Royalty nearly re
sulted in a tumble, but bis succeeding
efforts on his bay mare, Huntress, and his
bay gelding, Merry Boy, were excel
lent exhibitions of horsemanship. The
brown gelding, Blairneart, of blue
blooded English ancestry, made his
second appearance during the day.
The prize-winners were as follows:
HobÂ«rt's Huntress, Hobart's Merry Boy,
Wirthle's Button and Neave's Bobs.

HER MARRIED LIFE
PROVED A FAILURE
Marion Trumpour Asks the
Courts to Grant Her
a Divorce.
Alleges That Her Husband
Abused and Neglected to
Provide for Her.
Says He Cilled Her a Snake in the
Grassâ Prays for the Custody
of Her Children.
J. P. Trumpour, a prominent dentist,
having offices on Mission street, near
Twenty-third, is being sued for divorce,
hi 3 wi. r e alleging as cause that herself and
babies have been left to suffer through his
unkindness and penurious disposition.
She has placed the ca^e in the hands of
Thomas Lennon and Joseph K. Hawkins,
attorneys-at-law, and they will commence
proceedings on the ground of cruelty.
A complaint was tiled against Mr. Trum
pour yesterday. The suit promises to be
quite sensational in many of its details.
Mrs. Trumpour opens her allegations
against her husbanu by stating that, dur
ing the month of AugU9t, 1896, while she
was confined to her bed through illnes3
in her home, 2502 Howard street, her hus
band, in the presence of friends and her
minor children, called her opprobrious
and indecent names.
Among the expressions were, "A snake
in the grass" and "A hound," each pre
ced ed by an unnamable adjective.
She also alleges v in connection with the
above incident, that during her illness,
while she and her three children were in
need of the common necessaries of life,
her husband, whom she believes has an
income of $300 a month, refused to pay
the rent of his residence, or to buy lood
and medicine for nis family.
The most inhuman act cited in the legal
papers is alleged to have occurred on
Thanksgiving day, 1896. It is charged
that the defendant left his home a few
days prior to the holiday and his family
was left destitute. Mr. Trompour, ac
cording to the complaint, met one of his
children on the street and prevailed upon
her to carry a package of provisions to the
home he had deserted.
Mrs. Trumpour believes that the act was
a malicious rather than a kindly one, as
the parcel contained a dime in silver,
half a pound of tea, half a pound of coffee
and a roll of butter.
After stating in the complaint that she
does not believe her husband to be a fit
and proper person to have the care of her
children, and asking for their custody,
Mrs. Trumpour prays that an order re
straining her husband from selling the
household furniture be issued.
She states that she believes he wiil do so
if not prevented by order of court, and is
also fearful that he will forcibly take pos
ession of her children.
The couple were married in March, 1880.
Mrs. Silk's PertMiual Injuries.
Mrs. Ellen Silk, by her attorneys, Sullivan &
Sullivan, has sued the Market-struet Railway
Company for $20,000 for personal injuries.
She sets forth that on the 15 th of last Septem
ber, while attempting to alieht from a car be
longing to the company, at ihe corner of Mis
sion street and Precita avenue, tne car was
started forward suddenly, throwing her vio
lently to the ground, causing dangerous, pain
ful and permanent injuries to her spine and
n>rv(.us system. Siie thinks she will need
.^20,000 to compensate her for the damages
sustained.
The Scaly Ant-Eator.
An animal made of tinpla c, of theshape
of an elongated fir cone, about three feet
in lengih, which crackles and rustles with
every movement, is one of the latest ac
quisitions of the Zoological Society of Lon
don. Its name is the pangolin, or scaly
ant-eater, and it belongs to the same
family group as the armadillo and platy
pus. It has excited great attention at the
"Zoo," for it isâ if we are correctly in
formedâthe first animal of the kind
which has been exhibited there. Its home
is where the termites, or white ants, are
found; for the animal feeds on these de
structive creatures and possesses claws
which are desiened to break down their
strongholds. The claws are also necessary
lor burrowing in the ground, for the pan
golin excavates a cave fur himself and Lis
mate eight feet or so beiow the surface of
the earth, and in this strange home one or
two ycung are produced every year. The
pangolin at present at the "Zoo" is fed
upon ants and their egirs and also ex
hibits a partiality ror cockroaches scalded
in milk. The scales with which its body
is covered are hard and sharp as steel and
it can give a terribly cutting blow with its
powerful tail. It can roll its body up into a
ball like a hedgehog when it so wills.âPub

HOPE TO CURE
A VERY BAD LAW
The Grand Jury Consider
ing the Unequal Tax
System.
Double Work Imposed Upon As
sessors and Tax Collec
tors.
Over Half a Million Dolhrs Held
Out of Use for Over Haf
a Year.
The absurd and unjust system under
which the taxes are collected in this City
and County was the subject of adiscussiou
last evening between the members of the
Grand Jury and the heads of those depart
ments of the City government having to
do with taxes.
The purpose was to discover, if possible,
some means of correcting what is admit
ted by everybody who understands the
wordings of the law to be a gross discrim
ination against and hardship upon a great
number of taxpayers.
It was hoped that some plan might be
suggested under wnich relief might be
obtained from tiie next Legislature, and a
bill will probably be drawn up repealing
the present law and substituting some
more equitable method. City and County
Attorney Creswell, who was present, said
lie would lend any assistance that he could
in the matter. It was suggested that the
San Francisco delegation be asked to meet
with the jury and frame a bill such as may
work the desired reforms in the system.
Deputy Assessor Herzer presented a
statement showing the extraordinary
workings of the law, and Auditor Brod
erick emphasized the same in a short
address.
The latter pointed out that the system
added from $50,000 to $60,000 annually to
the expense ot collecting the taxes, and
tbat no less that $612,000 was tied up for
from six to eight months this year, out of
use by anybody, thiough the ridiculous
provisions of this law.
Herzer's statement showed that no less
a sum than $20,000 was added to the ex
penses of the Assessor's otiice alone every
year.
The law requires that personal taxes
not secured by real estate be col
lected summarily at the time of making
the assessment, and dv the assessors. The
collection must be made in March, April
or May, before the tax 'evy has been fixed.
The assessors collect on the rate ot the
previous year, with the understanding
that if the rate when fixed is lower or
higher than that rate the difference will
Oe subsequently' straightened up at the
time of tha regular collection of taxes in
October. Last year they collected in this
manner at a rate of $1 50 on the $100. Sub
sequently the rate was fixed at $2 25 on
the $100. The taxpayers who had paid
earlier in the year therefore had to come j
forward in October and make another j
payment covering the difference.
Th'.3year the Assessor collected the per- !
sonal property tax at the rate of last year. I
$2 -'â¢<, and the Supervisors subsequentiv
nxed the rate at $1.3982, and the Tax Col
lector is bound to renny the difference
to the taxpayer, entailing more than
double the work upon him. The excess
has been withdrawn from his case and has
been Jaying idle in the County treasury
since March anrt April, nine months, and
amounts to $172,732 20.
"Aside from tue lact that the Assessor
should not be the collector of taxes, this
being the duty of the lax Collector," said
Herzer, "it is unjust to make one class of
taxpayers pay their tax in March or April
when no tax rate has been fixed, when no
Board of Equalization has met. to wiiom
appeal can be made from an unjust assess
ment, while another class, the wealthier
owner of real estate, can pay his lowest
tax on personal property nine months
later, and, if he wishes to pay a penalty of
15 rjer cent, thirteen months later.
"The repeal of the law throughout the
whole State would be opposed by the as
sessors of the interior, they being allowed
6 per cent for the collection of personal
property taxes unsecured by real estate.
The only remedy for San Fiancisco would
be the passage of an act exempting coun
ties of the first class from the operation of
the law as now constituted and a return to
the lormer Jaw of collection. Whether
this can be done legally we would leave to
the City and County Attorney to advise."
The City and County Attorney said the
remedy could not be ?o easily applied, as
euch exemption would be directly con
trary to the code. Classification ot coun
ties could not be made for the purposes of
collecting taxes or for any purpose except
regulating salaries. Ha said that the
suit of Rode vs. Siebe, now before
the Supreme Court, called in ques
tion the constitutionality of the law
on the ground that it required the collec
tion cf taxes before any Board of Equaliza
lion was assembled as a court of appeals.
If the law was decided to be unconstitu
tional that w.ould settle the matter.
It was decided to take what measures
might be possible to secure an early de
cision in ti>e case and in the meantime to
pretare a bill to be presented by the San
Francisco delegation to the next Legisla
ture to cure the present law so far as pos
aible. '

BIAGINE'S VEAL.
It Gets Him Into Trouble With Health
Inspector Kiver.
Inspector Rivar of the Board of Health
made a clever capture of a raan who bad
been for some time suspected of bringing
immature veal into the City on Monday
morning. It was found that the veal came
from Huifmoon Bay and tbat it changed
hands at San Mateo, being brought into
this City by Joseph Biagini.
Eivcrs was on the lookout for him and
on Monday morning, and soon met him
driving toward the City. He was not
sure of his identity until Biagini whipped
up his horses, after the inspector had
passed, and Hew toward town atbreaknecK
speed.
He was caught after an exciting chase
of several miles and taken to the nearest
inspection station, where one ot the four
calves in his wagon was found to be unfit
f<-r food. It was confiscated.
CANNOT BORROW OR LEND.
A New Order lAgued to All Treasury
Department Officers and Employes.
Hereafter there is to be no more borrow
ing nor lending of money among the offi
cers of the Treasury Department of the
Federal Government. The edict went
forth on December 1, upon the direction
of Secretary of the Treasury Carlisle, and
a copy thereof was received and posted in
the Custom-house yesterday.
It is evident from this that the authori
ties at Washington do not want any
strinesnpon their subordinates. For ex
ample, if one of the customs officers should
borrow money lroni another of equal or
different rank there would naturally be
an obligation that would be a serious
stumbling-block in the way of an investi
gation by the powers that be, for no man
is likely to testify freely against one to
whom he is in debt.
Nor, on the other hand, is a man likely
to give testimony against a man who is in
his debt for fear that the debtor may be
dismissed and never bo able to pay what
he owes. This order applies to all of the
departments of the treasury, including
the local Sub-treasury and the Internal
Revenue cifice.
From all appearances it has been issued
to all treasury officials in the United
States, and the circumstance necessitating
the issuance of the same evidently arose
east of the Rocky Mountains.
This order accomplishes another fea
ture. It makes all of the Government
employes live within their salaries, for six
months or more ago an order was issued
prohibiting treasury and postorhce em
ployes from disposing of the warrants for
their salaries to warrant shavers and
brokers.
GLASGOW FOR SINGLE TAX
Second City of the British Em
pire Votes to Tax Only
Rents.
The Scotch Metropolis Elects a Town
Councl os the Straight Issue
by a Large Majmty.
Sinele-taxers in this City were delighted
to hear yesterday that Glasgow ha 3 gone
for single-tax with r. large majority, and
that now that great metjopolis has no
taxes save thesa on rents. The news came
in full iorm in a letter published in the
National Single-Taxer, and written by
John Paul, editor of the Glasgow Single-
Tax, to Henry George. The letter is, in
part, as follows:
GXjASGOW, Scotland, Nov. 12.â 1 write to
tell you of our glorious victory here in Glas
gow. We have won all along the hue at the
Glasgow municipal general electiou. We have
twenty-five wards, which send three members
each to tne Town Council. For the past fifty
years only one-tnird of the members have re
tired uinaAlly. This year, owing to a redistri
bution cl the wards, the whole seventy-five
members had to be returned. Mr. Burt was
elected in 1889.
The work was slow at first, and for three
yearsâ lÃ!)l to 1804â little was done iusido
tne Council. We went out to the electors a:id
to the men in the streets; wakened them up,
tnd then raised the question again et the
Council. Well, we have scored. Mr. Bun's j
sub-committee submitted a report on ihe 6th I
ot October in favor of present.nK a petition to !
Parliament to secure the necessary powers to |
make land values the basis of the "city's taxÂ»- j
tion. This was carried by 33 to 25 votes, and :
had the division been taken in a lull house we i
would hnvi! had nine of a majority.
Then the cairpaign commenced. The dis- I
cussion simply raged round land vfllues. Every- '
candidate wrs cither in favor of taxing land:
values or against it. In several of the wards j
there were from four to seven candidates j
standing lor the threts seats, all pledged aud i
appealing by their poÂ«tor< to "vote for and |
taxation of land values." Even Tories who '
hud voted consistently against it at the Coun- '
cil were paralyzed at the strength "f the single
tax in the public mind and nffonied immense
amusement by their pathetic declarations:
thai they now understood the question; that
the single tax was a just system of taxation;
ihat land monopoly w as a great cause of social !
evils; th^t the land speculators had no r!c;ht
to nny sympathy: thut their good friends the
s;ngle-taxirs might rest assured that they were
now informed and would vote straight next
time: that they had always believed in adjust
ing the incidence of taxation, etc.
Everybody admits it was a single-tax fight
and a single-tax victory, and we. have now at
the Town Council a majority of twenty-three
pledged supporters. There are seventy-seven I
membersâ seventy-five elected and two nomi- |
nated by the Council. Three years ngo we I
had about a dozen reliable men there.
Thus we have converted to the f-inele tax!
"the second city of the i>mpiro," tnd iroin this
citadel we can talk to the rest of the country, j
We leel absolutely sure of cur ground, for our
question has become the groat public question
here. The Scottish Liberal party has done
well for onr side, but it is not too much to say
that the question of taxing land values is now
acquiring a force, and an organized force, out
side tha domain of any party, that will carry
it to a speed v and successful Usue. Thesa are
bold m ords, but 1 know you will not misunder
stand me.
Then follows a few paragraphs of a gen
eral nature, and the letter ends with pre
dictions of a b; it'K t future for the single
tax movement.

THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 10, 1896.
FROM THE PARK
TO THE TRACK
An Excellent Scheme to
Open Up a Long and
Level Driveway.
It Would Abound in Good Views.
The Only Obstacle Is the
Spring Valley Company.
The Sunset District Improvement Cub
Is Working Hard to Secure the
Desired Obj ct.
The members of the Sunset District Im
provement Club are working bard to effect
an improvement in their locality which
would constitute a grand boon to all driv
ers and cyclists.
lt is no less than the direct connection
over a level and sterna route of Golden
Gate Park with the Ingleside Racetrack,
the road proposed being practically a belt
line between the Mission and the people's
great pleasure ground.
The route proposed is along Nineteenth
avenue, which commands a beautiful view
of the bay toward Marin County, San Ma
teo County, its lakes, surrounding hills
and the Ingleside track. The proposed
road would be 2% miles long and would
be largely level, having only a 2-per-cent
grade on the average. It is well within
the boundary secure from the rolling
sand nuisance. Part of the route is
through a beautiful grove of blue-gum
trees.
The only obstacle to this magnificent
driveway is HJOO feet of land belonging to
the Spring Valley Water Works Com
pany, lying between X street and the
Ocean House. This section is aliuo.st per
fectly level and the company stems to
think that there will be no objection to
its being opened for the accommodation
of the public. The present attitude is
that the company wishes to await the ar
rival of its secretary, who lias been visit
ing in the hast and who is expected to re
turn on the 21st inst.
It is understood that the property-own
ers in the district, who are fully alive to
the advantages to accrue from the opening
of the road, will be willing to shoulder the
expense of putting this driveway in order.
The making oi this road would be a
proat benefit, it is thought, to the entire
section which it traverses. Property
values would be likely to at once advance,
and the attention of homo-seekers would
be directed toward a suitable locality for
their object. In a general way it would
increase the attractiveness of San Fran
cisco by adding to its picturesque drives â
a consideration likely to weieh to an im
portant degree with the wealthier class
and those owning norses and vehicles.
The Sunset District Improvement Club
will forthwith work with zeal upon the
project, having placed the matter m
charge of the following street, committee:
Daniel Foiey, Richard Keller, Charles H.
Cushman, A. Harrington, L. Lippmann.
A BIG ORGANIZATION.
The Council of Associated Industries
of California Meets Officers and
Adopts a Constitution.
The Council of the Associated Industries
of California was organizad yesterday at
the rooms of the Manufacturers' and Pro
ducers' Association in the Mills building.
This name was reached only after a deal
of discussion, as each man present seemed
to have a nominal hobby.
Ttoose present at the meeting were, with
the organizations tliev represented, as
follows: Chamber of Commerce â N. P.
Cole, L. P. Listreto; State Board of Trade.
J. A. Filcher; Mechanics' Instituteâ E. P.
Hea'td. P. J. Healy, E. A. Denicke; San
Francisco Fruit Exchange. Isador Jacobs;
Manufacturers' and Producers' Associa
tionâ M. J. Keller, J. W. Kerr, Oscar
Lewis; State Development Committee â
Dav:d Rich, D. M. Cannon. Julian Sonn
tag, president of the Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association, acted as tempo
rary chairman.
The organization as formed consists of
three deieeatfes each from the State Board
of Horticulture, the State Board of Trade,
the Merchants' Association, the Chamber
of Commerce, the Board of Education, the
Board of Health, the Bu'lders' Exchange,
the Mechanics' Institute, the San Fran
cisco Fruit Exchange, the Association of
Improvement Clubs, the Manufacturers'
and Producers' Association and the State
Development Committee. Other bodies
of a like character may be admitted at the
pleasure of the association.
The object of this council is, "to secure
united action in all matters of interest
pertaining to the State of California." No
organization represented in the association
is bound by the action of its delegates
'unless such delegates be given full power
in writing to represent the organization."
The meetings of this association will be
held at 3 p. m. on the second Wednesday
of each montn. Special meetings may be
called by tne president at any time. The
next meeting will occur on tne first Mon
day in January.
Julian Sonntag wasunanimously elected
president of the association and thanked
the assembled delegates for the honor con
ferred upon him. David Rich was elected
vice-president and J. Richard Freud sec
retary and treasurer. At the next meeting
there will be elected an executive com
mittee of three on National legislation, of
three on State legislation, and of three on
municipalities, all of which are to be
elected annually.
ME. SHEA WAS BUSY.
Why PlsnÂ« for the Koof of the City
Hall Wore Not let
Beady.
Ihe secret of wny work has not been
begun on the new City Hall roof came out
at the meeting of the City Hall Commis
sioners on Tuesday when Architect Frank
Shea admitted that the contractor iiad not
begun work on the permanent structure
because the plans and specifications were
not complete.
Mr. Shea draws a comfortable salary as
City Hall architect which will cease when
the permanent roof is on the hall. Mr.
Shea is the successful designer of plans
for the new municipal building and most
of his time for several months back has
been occupied in this work.
Even the contractor for the dome had to
stop work until that roof was under way.
City and County Attorney Creswell is
angry about the matter and will have
something sharp to say to the architect at
the next meeting pf the Commissioners,
unless the plans are completed.
YEARNING FOR A COUNT,
Marie Viola Keller Loves Prus
sians and Is Lcokicg fcr
Another.
Thinks She Is Fqual to Several More
Husbands Before She
Dies.
Mrs. Marie Viola Keller was on hand as
required yesterday afternoon to complete
her deposition in the matter of her contest
of the will of the late Judge Hastings,
which was scheduled to take place in the
office of S. M. Shortridge at 2 o'clock yes
terday afternoon. The putative widow
wrs in the same bright and alert temper
that has characterized her since she came
under public notice in this case.
"It is a shame to insist on calling me
Mrs. Keller," she sa.'d. "I haven't had
that name for many years. I have always
been known of late years as Mrs. Hast
ings. All my Jegal papers, my insurance
policy and other such documents have ail
been made out in that name. Ob, I was
much too smart a woman to have it any
other way."
Mrs. KeUer was entertaining the Jittlo
gathering in the attorney's outer office,
awaiting the arrival of her own counsel for
the beginning oi the afternoon's proceed
ings.
"They say I talk Russian, too," she con
tinued, seeing that her auuienee was giv
ing her attention. "That's another mis
taKe. I know nothing of Russian, but 1
can taik I'russian, and I like it. I like the
Germans, and I like their language."
"That's because of the Prussian Count
you married," suggested one of the little
party.
"Exactly; that's it exactly," said the
lively little litigant. "It is because of tha
Prussian Count. He treated me well, and
I'm now looking for another one; I hope
to find him, too."
"I feel sorry for him," said one of her
hearers, jokingly.
"Oh, yon think I am good to bury sev
eral husbands yet, c!o you? Well, I think
so, too. At any rate, I'm looking for an
other Prussian Count. Oh, I know what
love is; yev, indeed, and I helieve in it."
Mr 3. Keller is not v jronng woman by
any means, but when she was young she
was quite pretty. All those who knew
her in those days agree ns to that.
Bhe was more than that; she was bright
intellectually and a good conveisational
ist. She bears yet evidences of these
favors of nature. She talks vivaciou-ly
and offer, cleverly. She insists that she is
coing to secure a widow's share of Judge
Hastings' estate, and warns those who are
opposed to her in the litigation that it will
be wiser to seek her favor.
While the notary and others waited in
the lawyer's office word was received from
Mr. Sullivan asking that the hearing go
over until to-morrow, as he had been un
expectedly overtaken by other affairs.
Accordingly the taking of the deposition
went over until to-day at 2 o'clock.
FIRST ART DRAWING.
Distribution of Local â¢ Pictures This
Evening Under Supervision or the
Mechanics' Institute Trustees.
The art drawing of the Association of
California Art Patrons will be held this
evening at 5 o'clock, in the Mechanics' In
stitute Library, on Post street. It will b3
held under the supervision of the insti
tute trustees and members of the associa
tion. .
Though the object of this new associa
tion has not been carried out on the scale
tnat wa3 originally intended, yet a% a be
ginning those who originated the idea are
satisfied that it promises well for the fu
ture. The reason given for commencing
en somewhat contracted lines is that the
idea of an association to patronize Califor
nia artists under the auspices of the board
of trustees of the Mechanics' Institute
was developed too late in the fair season
to make much of a stir by advertising the
plan. By this institution, which is to be
a part oi the Mechanics' Fair in future
years, picturta Â«-xhihited at the fair by
local painters will be chosen v.hen the ar:
gallery closes and then distributed among
the peoi le who become members of the
association on payment of 50 cents or
more.
The main thought is to thus dispose cf
local paintings of merit on the art drawing
plan and so to help artists, while enabling
persons of me derate means to seenre valu
able pictures.
As a start ten paintings by well-known
San Francisco painiers will be distributed
at the library. The pictures include land
jcapep, a portrait, flower pieces and genre
subjects. Miss Alice Chittenden sold a
painting of pansies to the association, a
study in strong colors and up to the hisrh
standard of her flower pictures, lhere
are two landscapes from Carl yon Per
bandtâ"Rondout Creek, New York," and
"Gualala River, California," both of them
refined little pictures. Oscar Kunalh'i
picture is a finely modeled "Study of a
Head," a portrait of a fair pirl in light
color. The pictures from John M. Gamb c
are water colors, one "Evening in France,"
;he other "Arab Yard : El Biar."
L. P. Latimer sold two landscapes, "A
Pastoral" and "Sunset," handled in his
well-known characteristic style, and H. R.
Bloomer's pictures in the list are "The
Valley of the Come, England," and "Out
skirts of Barbazon."
STANTON ANXIOUS
TO APPLY THE AX
Believes That Southern Pa
cific Rates Should Be*
Reduced.
He Proposes a Thorough Investi
gation of the Affairs of
the Railroad.
La Rue and Clark Put a Brake on
His Ardorâ Legal Adv.ce to
B3 Sought.
There is more and deep trouble in store
for the Southern Pacific Company. Rail
road Commissioner S.anton is not at all
satisfied with the present state of affairs
and is impatient to ba doing something
that will prove that his position and that
of his colleagues is not a sinecure. But
he stands alone in hi 3 impatience, though
not in his desire to bring relief to the
people of the State from the exactions of
the raifread monopoly.
When the commission met in regular
session yesterday all three members wtre
present, and the recent decision of Judge
McKenna was the important theme of
discussion. This, it will ba remembered,
declared rhe commission to be a consti
tutional body, "but held that the 8 per cent
reduction on grain rates was unreason
able.
While Commissioner Stanton was will
ing to forego the pleasure of further
â lashing at grain rates until the matter
wai brought up and decided on its actual
merits-, he wanted to swing the official ax
at rates on all other commodities. With
this object ho made the following motion :
Thnt this commission proceed to the inves
tigation of the finances and standing of the
Southern Pacific Company and its leased lines
tor t lie purpose of tixing a schedule of rates.
Explaining the plan of the proposed in
vestigation Slanton said:
"If we pursue this line of inquiry we
shall secura from the railroad company
all its tariff sheets, all changes in the
c assification of freights, all amendments
to tariff sheets, all special rates, ail special
contracts and all commodity tariffs."
Commissioner Clark thought thi3 gait
was a little too speedy and put on the
brakes with word 3of caution and pru
dence, pitched to the tune of economy.
"Before we go into sued an oxpensive
investigation," he said, "we ought to ask
ttie Legislature or the Board of Examiners
for a financial funti, as we have no money
now on hand to go into it."
Ignoring this interruption Stanton con
tinued: %> lf we v;ait until the case relat
ing to the 8 per cent reduction on grain
rates is finally decided we will have to
wait six months or a year."
Chairman La Rue was evidently in
clined to caution, also. "I think we
should be guided largely by the Aitorney-
General." he said, "in following an in
vestigation in this matter. I believe we
should go to trial on the merits of th#
case now pending. The only kind of in
vestigation we could have would amount
to but little and would result like that of
last fall. We came to the conclusion that
8 per cent was a reasonable reduction, but
they went to court and the court decided
it was not reasonable. We can now matce
them prove their case in court. The
court's decision was based on figures Eub
mit:ed by the railroad's side alone."
Commissioner Stanton contended that
the Board of Railroad Commissioners was
just as important a court as the United
States Court.
"If we go into all the details of the in
vestigation," he continued, "we shall have
on record something that can always be
used as a basis for our calculations in rate

the rates are now based more on what
the railroad can get out of the traffic than
on the amount of capital invested. Our
action will not interfere in any way with
tne 8 per cent case, nor with the ( proposed
action of the Attorney-General.
Chairman La Rue was of the opinion
that nothing should be done in the mat
ter of rate reductions until the gram
rate question was finally decided, and
Clark agreed with him. La Rue. in the
course of the discussion, stated that he
nad talked with the Attorney-General
and tbat the latter intended to go on with
the pending grain rate case. 4 .
Stanton called attention to the fact that
the 25 per cent reduction resolution was
before the toard, and remarked that in
accordance with the affidavit filed with
tne Circuit Court, it would bd necessary
to hold an investigation of the Southern
Pacific Company's affairs.
After some further discussion It was de
cided to confer with the Attorney-General
and the attorneys who are associated with
him in the grain rate case before any
thing further is done in the matter of rate
reductions. The motion to this effect was
made by Clark. It was carried by the
votes of the chairman and Clark. Stan
ton voted against it. Secretary Newman
was instructed to arrange for the con
ference.
After deciding to include the full text of
Judge McKenna's decision^ the report
of the Commissioners, adjournment was
taken until the next regular meeting, De

FATHER YORKE
TO BE ARRESTED
He Is Charged With Com
mitting Criminal
Libel.
The Complaining Witness Is
George Thistleton, R-al
Estate Dealer.
The Alleged Lib.'l Was Contained in
an Article in the Monitor of
October 17.
A warrant was sworn out in Judge
Campbell's court yesterday for the arrest
of Rev. Father Peter C. Yorke, editor of
the Monitor, on the charge of criminal
libel.
The complaining witness is George This
tleton, a reai estate dealer, who was editor
and proprietor ot the,defunct paper, the
Jolly Giant.
The complaint was drawn up by Thistle
ton'3 attorney. It is a type-written docu
ment of two pages and was not handed to
the clerk ol the court for some hours after
the Judge had signed the warrant for
Fattier Yorke's arrest.
The libel complained of was published
in the Monitor of October 17. It was in the
shape of an article that reads as follows:
*'fc)picy minutes of Council No. 1. The
records of the doings of Council No. lis
becoming awfully spicy. We ask our
readers to peruse this week's installment
very carefully, as it tells the tale of the
Sacramento convention. Old Thistleton
of the defunct Jolly Giant told the mem
bers how he was an A. P. A. before there
were any A. P. A.'s and how Rome's r-Â»ci
hand finally landed him in San Quentin."
The complaint continues that Father
Yorke, in making this statement about
the complaining witness, willfully and
maliciously libeled him, as it is false and
defamatory.
The Judge fixed Father Yorke's bonds
in the sum of $1000, and the warrant was
banded to a policeman to serve upon him.
As soon as it was known that there was
a warrant out for the arrest of Father
YorKe there was the greatest excitement
in the City Hall, and a large number of
people called at Judge Campbell's cham
bers to leiirn the particulars.
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. 9.â The Rev.
Father Yorke, in his lecture at Oakland
last night, referred to the suit as follows:
"I have just escaped from San Fran
cisco, where, I am told, there is a warrant
out for my arrest on a charge of having
spoken disrespectfully of something thai
has long been* a stench in the nostrils of
respectable people on both sides of the
bay. lam told that I have been sued for
having spoken disrespectfully of one

Brief History of an IJonored Citiz n,
a Brave So d er and a Prominent
Memb.T of the Brotherhood.
At last night's meeting of the Mystic
Shrine Charles L. Fieid was called
forward and, with a few well-chosen
â words of congratulation ana esteem,
Illustrious Noble Reuben H. Lloyd
presented him with a jewel of the
rank, of "Imperial Potentate of Nobles of
the Mystic Shrine." He presented it, Mr.
C. L. FIELD, Who Was Presented With the Jewel of Past Imperial
Potentate of North America*
Lloyd said, as a mark of the hij;h appre
cat on in which Mr. Field is held by his
brothers of the Mystic Circle on Mr.
yield's retirement irom the high position
which he has held.
Mr. Field has been a Mason since 1867,
â wnen he joined a lodge in Westbrook, Me.
HfÂ» went through the Royal Chapter in
1868 and in 1877 he became a Royal and

illustrious grand master of Royal Street
Masons of the BtatÂ« of California and was
elected commander of Golden Ga.e Com-
mandery in 1893 : in 1891, he was elected
Previous to this, in 1891, be was elected
potentate of Islam Temp c. A. A. O. M. p..
. finishing His term in 1892. On .the.2i v of
September of the same year he was elevated
to the seat of the imperial potentate of the
Nobles of the Mystic Shrine, which office he
has juat retired from, and upon which re
tirement the jewel was presented as al
ready stated.
He was born on "the 2d of September,
1845, at Danville, State of Maine. He en
listed on the 2d of September, 1862, in
Company G, Twenty-third Regiment of
Maine. He was promoted from the ranks

of September, beinc the second man of his
regiment retired in 1565. Two years later
he joined the Masons.
He is the father of one daughter, who
was born September 2, 1862. It will be
seen from the history of his life that the
figure two has played a strange part in the
dates which mark the stepping-stones of
his career.
After the presentation of the jewel the
following officers were elected: Charles L.
Field, past imperial potentate, elected
and installed potentate; Alfred W.
Baldwin, chief rabban ; W. H. F. Titus,

COX, THE BOY TRAMP.
He Kscapes From the Newsboys' Home
With, a Loaded Revolver.
The police are searching for Curtis Cox,
the boy tramp from Colorado, and a com
panion named Albert Moll, who escaped
from the Newsboys' Home, 407 Taylor
street, Monday night, taking with them a
number of articles, including a revolver,
belonging to some of the other inmates.
Curtis was arrested about three weeks
ago for robbing the till in a fruitstore on
Market street near the ferry. He told a
pitiful tale of being compelled to steal by
a bad man whom he met at San L-andro
several days previous and bow he had to
run away from home owing to the cruel
treatment o{ his stepfather.
His story enlisted the sympathy of Su
perintendent Carman of the Newsboys'
4ome and he succeeded in getting Curtis
sent to the home instead of the Whittier
Reformatory. Tne boy was kindly treated
at the home, the superintendent taking a
special interest in him. Now he has es
caped with a revolver in his possession
and the chances are that he will soon find
himself behind the bars. He i* 15 years
of use and the boy Moll is only 12.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 10, 1896.
A HEAD FOR THE
NEW HIGH SCHOOL
The Matter Creates a Lively
Discussion Among the

New Teachers Appointel by the

The question as to whether a principal
for the proposed Mission High School
should be appointed before the school was
an accomplished fact was hotly debated
before the meeting of the Board of Eluca
tion last evening.
Director Hawley wanted Charles H.
Murphy appointed at a salary of $175 per
month, but was opposed by Superinten
dent Babcock and Director Mnrdock, who
thought that it was going to put a princi
pal on salary in addition to two teachers
already engaged in looking after the forty
two High School scholars now quartered
in the Horace Mann School.
The question was lam on the table
when the candidate himself sent in a corn-
munication requesting that the matter be
laid over.
The board declined to erant the request
of a number of parents of scholars who
ask that their children be not transferred
from the Sutro and Richmond schools
to the Park School, and ruled that the
children of that neighborhood be required
to attend school in the district that has
been designated for said schools.
On the recommendation of the Commit
tee on Salaries the compensation of teach
ers was reduced as follows: Miss K. E.
Whittaker, teacher of cookine, $100 to $75
per month; Mis-* A. A. Love, teacher to
Starr King Primary School, from $83 to
$74 per month.
Mrs. H. B. Stecle, a teacher of history
wish the stereopticon, whose term expires
in January, was re-engaged to hold at the
pleasure of the board, her compensation
to be $ICO per month.
The position of secretary of the City
Board of Examiners, held by George W.
Wade, was declared vacant and Miss P. M.
Nolan was appointed to the olhce for two
years. The compensation oi the new
secretary will be fixed by the Committee
on bal&rlea. Mrs. George M. Wade sent
in a communication requesting that no
action be taken in her husband's case as
assistant secretary of the board until he
can be heard in the matter. The subject
was referred to the commiitee of the whole.
The action of the committee of the
whole in awarding the prize for the best
plan for the nÂ«Â»w Mission High School to
Charles I. Havens, the second prize to W.
0. Banus ami the third to Caiiill & Con
don was approved.
The secretary of the Committee on
Buildings and Grounds was instructed to
advertise for proposals for constructing
the building in accordance with the ac
cepted plans.
A number of residents of the Mission
sent in a communication objecting to the
transfer of the Mission Hich School class
irom the Horace Mann School to the
Hawthorne School. The matter was re
ferred to the Classilication Committee.
A bill of $500. sent in by Sulnvan & Sul
livan, the â attorneys empioved to conduct
the litigation between the Boards of Edu
cation and Health, over the closing ol the
Everett, Marshall and Mission schools,
was referred to che .Knance Commutee.

Company having reported favorably on
the title of the lot on which it is proposed
to locate the new Mission High School.

MIDWEEK THEATER NOTES
â¢'la, .tain Bob's" Last Act, at the Bald
win â Danger in an *-levator
at the Columbia.
Wilton Lacnaye's double bill at the
Baldwin is giving him a chance to display
his versatility in two very different roles.
The pretty, curtain-raiser, "Moliere," is
still a favorite, out the last act in "Cap
tain Bob" saves that drama from meriting
the fate of oblivion. There is a dramatic
quality in the last net which is lacking in
the two preceding it, and the author, in
saving his good wine till the end, has
achieved the result of Bonding the audi
ence home in a satisfied frame of mind.
Although "Moliere" and "Captain Bob"
are running very smoothly, especially ior
new plays, Mr. Lackaye might increase
the effectiveness of his "Moliere" by en
gaging a French master to give a few hints
in pronunciation to some of the members
of his troupe.
On Monday Miss Ellen Beach Yaw, the
altitudinous soprano, makes h-r San
Francesco debut at the Baldwin with her
own concert trouDe. and on Thursday the
holiday season will open with Palmer
Cox's "Brownies."
That exciting melodrama, "The Cotton
King," is giving such satisfaction at the
Columbia Theater that it will be continued
for another week. The elevator scene is a
champion blood- curdler, for, a* the press
agent feehngy points out, although a
safeguard is provided to prevent the pon
derous scene from descending too far
when Richard Stockley thrusts the heroine
beneath it, tue slightest hitch would not
only prevent the cumax, but would be de
cidedly dangerous to tne person playing
the heroine's part. This is putting the case
mildly, for if the machine did go on the
rampage there would not bamuch heroine
left. However, the management states
that due safeguards are used, and the scene
as it stands is very thrilling.
The Frawley Company opens the holi
day season at the Columbia on the 17th

Some good work is being done by the
Alcazar Company this week in "Ala

County Justice, who has reached the age
of 40, tied to his mamma's apron-string,
and who contemplates the desperate deed
of marriage, without any idea of doing the
preliminary courting. George Osbourne,
especially engaged for the production, is
doing effective wor_ as the proud old
planter, and the rest of the cast
is doing good work. On the whole the
staging is very effective, but in the scene
amid the ruins the electric glare of the
Southern moon very emphatically denies
the description which Colonel Moberly
gives of it as "warm and golden." The
black background of the star-spangled
heavens, too, is hard to explain, when the
moon is shining as brightly as astrong arc
light can make it. Barring these peculiar
light effects, the staging of "Alabama" is
all that one could desire, and more than
one has a right 10 expect.
â¢'The Land" is a drama full
of melodramatic interest, which is draw

week. Victory Bateman is doing excel

ever.

JACKSON'S STORY.
Story of the Killing of Florentine Told
by the Defendant in Court
Yesterday.
In the trial of Arthur Jactson, charged
with the murder of Aueust Florentine,
the greater part of Tuesday was devoted
to proving that Florentine was a danger
ous and desuernte man. That, he killed
one man in this City several years ago is
established by ihe court records.
James H. Dunn, Benjamin Davis,
Thomas Conway, James P. Dockpry,
John lieilly and Daniel S. McFadden
tcsiitied that Florentine was a dangerous
man. They thouaht he was not a good
man to cross or interfere with when he
was excited.
The defendant took the witness-stand
and testified in his own behalf. He ia not
quite 21 years old, is quiet and unassum
ing and told in a direct manner the cir
cumstances of the homicide.
"I was fitting on a beer-keg near the
door of Mr. Florentine's saloon, 'â¢" said
Jackson, "when some young men came in,
and soon I heard them cet into a quarrel
with the proprietor. He was behind the
bar. One of the men in front of the bar
said 'Go to h â ,' and he seemed to think
they were talking to him. One of the
visitors told him that they had not told him
to go to h â , and he turned on mi,
Although I had not mixed up in the quar
rel at all, he may have thought so.
"When he pulled his pistol I started to
back out and called out for him to nut his
gun down. He lowered it for a moment
and then raised it again and snapped it at
me twice. As I wns backing out and
while he was pointing his pistol at me 1
had pulled my pistol from my hip pocket,
and when he snapped it at me I tire 1. I
couid not help it, m I was acting in sell
defense."
Jackson said he was near the door when
he fired the shot, and when asked W: y he
did not get out quickiy and thus avoid
taking a man's life tie replied that ne
was afraid he would be shot in the back if
he tried it.
Thomas Foley and others testified that
Florentine was not ai>articularly danger
ous man. Mr. Foley naid that he might
be considered dangerous if aroused by
what he considered an affront.
The testimony will clo^e this morning
and the case will go to the jury this after
noon.
THE EMERGENCY HOME.
Entertainment Given in Behalf of the
Worthy Project Las* Kvenlng.
The project of the Emergency Home in
connection with the Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Children got a lift
lust night. The project has been vieor
ously agitated by Mrs. John Puttee and by
the ladies whom she called her to aid. Lust
evening an entertainment wai given at
the Native Sons' Hall which was generous
in quantity ai:d excellent in quality. For
this many tickets were sold. The attend
ance was not as large as had been ex
pected, another fashionable event, the
horse show, drawing many who held
tickets.
Altogether a considerable sum was con
tributed :or the benefit ot the worthy
charity in view, but the net proceeds wili
not be known for some days. The sum
will not be sufficient to do all that is de
sired. This was made plain in a brief ad
dress by Mr. Welch, secretary of the So
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children, who officiated as master of cere
monies. Mr. Welch told the audience
that he wished to thank them in behalf
of Mrs. Pettee. But that was r-otthe last
time they would be asked to help. They
would be appealed to, time and time a^ain,
until enough money and clothing and food
and fuel couid be provided to give comfort
to poor children.
A programme of musical and literary
exercises, the former beintr directed by
Professor Piccirillo, was first given. Miss
Hattie Nathan gave a dialect recitation,
Walter Lind performed a violin solo, Miss
Margaret Coleruan and G. P. Grodgens
sung, and tne Mascagni Mandonliu Club
performed two selections. All these num
bers went off well and were applauded.
Richard I. Whelan was expected, in comic
selections, but lie failed to appear. After
the opening exercises ttie floor was cleared
and dancing took place. Thu floor manager
was Thomas McGeorge. The floor com
mittee consisted of Porter Roberts, John
Pettee Jr., Joseph J. Pettee, Charles Ben
der, Charles Cartau and Harry Mucondry.
The reception committee consisted of Mrs.
John Pettee, Mrs. C. P. Welch, Miss
Adeline Hainque, Miss Margaret O'Malley,
Miss Nellie O'Malley and Miss Julia
Welch.

FILED A BOOK
AS A REPORT
Unique Volume of 640 Pages
by the Fair Special
Administrators.
The Value of the Estate Given at
Nearly Seventeen Mil
lion Dollars.
The Administrators Will, on This
Basis, Get the N at P urn of
Over $160,000
The final report of the special adminis
trators of the Fair estate was filed yester
day with County Clerk Curry. The report
is in the form of a large bound book and
comprises no less than 640 pages.
It is type-written and recounts every
thing from the death of James G. Kair,
December 2<J, 1894, to November 16, 1896.
James S. Angus, Thomas G. Croihers and
W. S. Goodfellow, who made the report,
seem to have covered everything that
could be thought of.
The index alone takes sixteen solid
pages. Th s is exclusive of the page 3
hitherto mentioned. It takes six pages of
the index to merely enumerate the prop
erty.
ThÂ«j value of the estate as a whole is
given at about $16,633,455. It is set forth
that it has increased in value in a sum
equal to the enhanced value of the North
Beach property, plus the cash on hand at
the close of the special administration.
This is estimated at $500,000.
The cash that has passed through the
administrators' hands is $4,633,455. The
bonds and stocks and obligations are val
ued at. $12,500,000. There is $481,356 68 in
cash on hand also.
According to this valuation of the es
tate trie three administrators at the lOJper
cent which is >is;>posed to be allowed
would cet $160,000, or over $50,000 each.
ThfÂ» 10 per cent i> allowed by law.
Even the wheat deal has space in the
booK. It tells that at histleaih there were
207,000 tons on hand, of which 192.100 tons
were stored at Port Co-ta. Ii tells how
192,100 tons were pledget for certain
debt-i; of the selling of the tviieat and pay
ment of the debts.
The various ranches are described, with
theirlocation, size and improvements that
have been made. There are lists of the
number of cows, horse?, broodmares and
every form of livestock. The smallest
product of the farm appears to be men
tioned.
The novel feature of the report is its
boo_ form. No report, so the officials say,
has ever before been made in this shape.
The book is so stnkiusriy large, too, and
comprises so many details, both of matier
descriptive of the various properties, and
the action of attorneys and court?, that it
is almost bewildering to contemplate it.
Of course there is a mass of it that is
more or ies^ famiiiar to the average news
paper reader, who, whether he would or
not, has absorbed more <Â»r less regarding
the treat Fair est-ite. Mrs. Craven has
her place ii the book, as all tiie other
claimants. It will be a volume that will
no doubt so down in hisiory.

Why "Timothy" Graas Is So Called.
~ The forage grass. known to the farmers
cf the United States .as. timothy is so
called because ' tint introduced, and ;; ex
tensively, cultivated in this country by one
Timothy Hanson, a farmer of Maryland.
This species of era's is well known in Eng
land and all over Western continental
Europ'*, where it is grown extensively by
most farmers between the Mediterranean
and the North Sea.- The botanical, name
of ; this grass is Pblenmpra tense. Tim
othy is known in the British Isles as cats
tail grass, and in several of our Eastern
States as , herd 'or herd's grass. â  It was
grown in/ lnr;Â»e quantities in Maryland
nnd Pennsylvania long before a spear of it
had ever been seen in England, the first
seed of â  it ever seen ;; in Q the : . last-named
country being imported' from America. â
St. Louis' Republic. . v
â¢âÂ«â¢ â Â«. â Â»
: Chinese dentists rub a secret powder on
the gum of the affected tooth and after
about fifteen 'minutes the patient is told
to sneeze. - The, tooth then falls out. Many
attempts have been made by European
dentists to, secure this powder, but none
have succeeded in doing ?o. ' ;

ALL THE ESTATE
Mrs. Hannah Bartlow Con
mitted Bigamy Many
Years Ago.
Her Surviving Partner With
Whom Sbe Lived for Twenty
Years Not Her Husband.
C'oseof a Case That Has Caused Law
yers and Officials Trouble for
a Long Time-
Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Dec. & f
Judge Greene has just decided an inter
esting case that has caused more litigation
in proportion to the value of the estate in
volved than any similar case in Alameda
County.
About ten years ngo Hannah Ann Bart
low dieii in this city and left an estate
which has been estimated at various times
between $100 and $1, 000, 000.
Her husband. William Bartlow, was the
bootblack at the Occidental Hotel across
thÂ« bay, and when his wife died he natu
rally conducted that her estate was his.
He was allowed to cherish this idea undis
turbed until about two years ago, when a
colored woman named Rebecca Douglas
came to Oakland from He.ena, Mont. She
enpaped the services of eight lawyers to
recover the estate, which she declared be-
Jonged to her, and which she represented
tv be worth a fabulous sum.
Bartlow. the bootblack, was ordered into
court to give an accounting, and his report
showed that the estate was worth about
$GOO. Rebecca at once proceeded to sue
him for embezzlement, but he had no dif
ficulty whatever in showing that he bad
acted honestly throughout, and that he
had not squandered tbe estate, which only
existed in Rebecca's imagination.
Nothing daunted, Becky secured the
services of some more attorneys, and for
several weeks the offices of Major Whit
ney, the attorney for the Public Adminis
trator, were thronged with pompous law
yers anxious to recover that million-dol
lar estate. In speaking of the matter the
major said that they were more impor
tunate and numerous than the pretty
teagirls that he encountered on his now
historic walk from Yokohama to Osaka.
As iJeoky would not sign any paper that
wouid make it possib c to distribute the es
tate she went in que^t of more attorneys,
declaring that the eleven she bad previ
ously engaged w>-re all kinds of aishonest
people. As a last resort she went to San
Francisco ana placed her interests in the
hands of O'Brien, O'Brien &, O'Brien, and
a few days ago they brought suit to deter
mine iho heirshin of the estate. It was
then that Becky told her remarkable
story.
She said that she and her mothtr were
living at Boston in 1853, and that up to
that time her mother was not married,
and that her name was Hannah Bowers.
In that year she married a gentleman
named Melvin, at the same time giving
her name as Hannah Bloodcum. The
day after the marriage Mr. and Mrs. Mel
vin set sail for San Francisco and for
many years the laay Kept a boarding
house in that city. A few years after her
arrival she sent lor her daughter, Becky,
who arrived here about iB6O. In 1875
Becky saw William Bartlow at her moth
er's house. She had not seen Mr. Melvin
ana she testified to Judge Greene yesterday
that she asked her mother some very
pointed questions and that the only re
ply she obtained was, "Becky, hold your
tongue; if you know when you are well
off, you don't want to know any more
than I am willing to tell you."
Other witnesses proved that they saw
Melvin within a year of the time when it
was known that she did eventually marry
Bartlow. and as there was no evidence of
a divorce and in tbe face of testimony
eouW be no presumption of death, Ju !ge
Greene declared that Mrs. Hannah Bowers-
Bloodcum-Melvin-Bartlow was never the
legal wife of William Bartlow, but there
was evidence to show that Becky was her
daughter; consequently Judge Greene de
cided that Becky is the sole heir to thees

There is still a legal matter to be settled

Garnty was chairman of the evenins and
opened the proceedings by introducing

corded one or two encores, af er which
Chairman Ciarrity, in a timely speech, in
troduced Rev. Father P. C. Yorke. The
Chancellor said in brief :
"There is one thing in Oakland that I
do not believe wouid be tolerated in any
other city in the world. I refer to the dis
crimination shown by your library trus
tees against Catholic publications. There
are ten sectarian papers paid for, but
although the Monitor is sent free every
week it is forbidden a place in the files of
your reading-rooms. The same treatment
is accorded the Star. Ido not b.ame non-
Catholics, but I b arne Catholics. You
have known this for two months and not
one step have you made to have -.he wrong
rightea. Such cowardice has no place in
the Catholic churchâ it is of the jelly-fish
order.
"Even Oakland library trustees cannot
withstand public opinion, and Catholics
m Oakland have no need to plead for
justice â they can compel it. If Catholics
acted as they ought, papers of their faith
would be placed on the files their taxes
pay for to-morrow, or else every sectarian
paper would be excluded, which would be
put right."
Want Trade Kept at Home.
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. 9.â The Mer
chant*' Exchange is inquiring into the
prevailing s-ystern by w ich Oakland's
chief officials have their uniforms made j
in San Francisco. At last night's meet
ing of the exchange Director Brown
brought the matter up, and said that Cap
tain Fletcher was measured a few days
aLO for a suit by a foreign solicitor, and
that Policeman Kieth was guilty of the
same treachery to the best interests of
this city. The result was that the secre
tary was instructed to invite the Police
and Fire Commisbioners and the chiefs or
of Police and Fire departments to meet
with the exchange at its next meeting and
try to arrive at an understanding whereby
the trade in uniforms may be kept in this
city.

OAKLAND, Cal, Dec. 9.â The City
Council nas rejected all the bids thus far
received for lands for a West Oakland

The trouble in the selection is that there
are many interests in West Oakland, each
of which wants the park in its particular
locality, and owing to this lack ol har
mony the Council will try to obtain offers
ofnew sites.

OFFICERS OF THE ELECTRIC CLUB.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 10, 1896.
FOR CONTROL OF
THE DELEGATION
The Fight for Patronage Is
More Interesting Than
Usual.
President Stetson May Enter the
O.fice of the District
Attorney.
Senator-E ect Stratton Is Just Now
the Cuter of Much
Interest
Oakland Office San Feancipco Call.)
908 Broadway, Dec. 9. \
A very pretty fight is going on for the
patronage that will be dispensed by the
Alameda delegation to the Legislature
and incidentally that to be dispensed lo
cally by the Supervisors. All kinds of
deals are reported, many of them, of
course, without other foundation than
that of the hopes of the aspirant for pre
ferment. But there is no doubt that the
central figure in this connection is Sena
tor-elect Fred Stratton.
Supervisor Roeth is anxious to provide
a place for J. W. Stetson, who was formerly
a deputy under County Clerk Crane and
later an unsuccessful candidate on the
Republican ticket for Justice of the Peace.
Stetson was a hard worker for Roeth in tbe
latter' s recent campaign for Supervisor,
and is now piesident of the Young Men's
Republican Club. There Is no patronage
at Roeth's command which would be ac
ceptable to Mr. Stetson, but Mr. Roeth,
who will dispense the patronaee of the Re
ceiving Hospital as soon as the new Board
of Supervisors meet, can give an ap
pointment to Senator Stratton by placing
his brother in charge of the Receiving
Hospital.
On the Ist of January the resignation of
Carl Wood, who is now a deputy in the
District Attorney's office, will take effect,
and there is no doubt that Mr. Stetson,
who is a bright young lawyer, would like
to fill the vacancy. The impression
seems to have gained ground that Senator
Stratton has the privilege of naming the
successor to Can Wood, and that if Roeih
will place Dr. Btratton in charge of the
Receiving Hospital Senator Stratton will
return the compliment by doing all he can
to maKe Roeth s friend, Stetson, a deputy
District Attorney.
All this, however, hinges somewhat on
the control of the Alr.meda delegation,
for, if Senator Btratton is not placed in
that control, it is not quite clear how he
will be able to give any leturn lor the
placing of Stetson.
The control of the delegation is iust now
the most interesting topic among the mem
bers, and there is a general feeling that
the individuals who compose it are too
'ndependent to submit to any control.
When asked regarding the subject, Frank
Leavitt, who will represent the Forty
eighth Assembly District, said: "I do not
think that anybody can control tbe Ala
meda County delegation. Personally I
am friendly to ail the members and would
willingly help their interests, but the in
terests of the county and the party in een
eral must supersede all personal feelinj?.
I should be willing to caucus upon all
matters and would abide by the result of
the caucus. I am opposed to anybody
posing as leader of the delegation, and I
don't think anybody will submit to any
dictation."
NO WASTE AT THE BLIND HOME.
The Superintendent Shjh He Can Satisfy
the Governor.
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. 9.âSuperintend
ent Wilkinson of the Blind Asylum at
Berkeley says that he is convinced that
Governor Budd will approve the claims of
that institution when ha bears the details.
Superintendent Wilkinson was seen to
day regarding the statement, and he said
he was preparing a reply to Secretary
Markiey's communication just received.
"ThÂ» bills were for tbe quarter ending
September 30," said he, "and covered the
opening of school here. It has been the
custom for years to have as little help as
we can get along with during the summer
vacation. There are no music or gym
nasium teachers, no baker, and the num
ber of waiters and dishwashers is reduced,
which results in quite a saving, but when
school reopens these must all be again
employed, and it is this that caused the
increase of $400 in salaries in one month.
"Had the board looked at the bills or
compared them with those of the same
date last year, it would have been seen
w y there was an increase of salaries at
that particular time. I have no doubt
the explanation will be sufficient to ease
the minds of the examiners when they re
ceive it. Tbe same raise is to be found for
a number of year* buck, and results in a
saving of neaVly $1000 a year. The state
ment that the trusiees_ were going to re
quest a larger appropriation this year is
refuted by the annual report, which was
made some weeks ago, and only asks for
the same amount we hud last year."
He Wait an Oakland Man.
OAKLAND, Cal.. Dec. 9.-A. P. Carter,
who was found dead in bed at Columbus,
Ohio, was an Oakland man.
Deceased was the son of Mrs. Julia Car

a brother of Mrs. lsabelle M. Morgan, one
of the teachers of tne Lincoln School, and
of Daniel P. Carter of San Francisco and
Edward G. Carter ol Cottonwood, Shasta
County. He was born near Oroville,
Butte County, November 4, 1856, and had
been married twice, but left no fami.y.

his second died in June. The mother says
he never recovered from the shock of her
death and at that time began to have
heart trouble, which finally took him off.
The remains will be interred in Columbus.
He had been traveling with Sells Bros.'
circus for a couple of months.
He Was Xot Single.
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. 9.â The suit of

NECESSITY DEMANDS IT.
Receiving Hospital Can Be .Established
at a Small Cost Now
in Alameda.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Dec. 9.â One of the
greatest needs of this city ,as sesn by the
physicians, is a receiving hospital. The
Board of Health has .acknowledged the
need but hai failed to solve thn problem.
At the present time it is being suggested
that the Board of Trustees secure a room
at the Alameda Sanitarium, on San Jose
avenue, to be used in cases of emergency.
It possesses the advantage of beini; run in
the interest of no particular class of physi
cians and is open to all schools of medi
cine. It has been also suggested that a
small receiving hospital be erected in the
rear of the City Hail, but here the advan
tages of trained nurses at hand would be
loÂ»t.
No doubt but in the near future this
important problem will be settled in favor
of humanity, but meanwhile people who
are hart are Deing aLowed to suffer untold
agony while crossing Webster street to
reach Oakland, a course which often aggra
vates the injuries, if not making them
fatal.

THE DEBTS OF
NINETY-SEVEN
A Relic of the Blue and
Gold Published Last
Year.
The Seniors Owe Something Over
a Thousand Dollars, but
Have No Assets.
The Reorganization of the Alameda
County Miners' Association
Eff cted.
BERKELEY, Cal., Dec. 9.â What la to
become of the 97 class debt is a question
that is being much discussed at present in
university circles.
Tbe present senior class is in a unique
position in its financial troubles, being
near the end of its career as a class so
heavily embarrassed that very radical
measures will be required to settle its
debts, which amount to over $1000.
How can a class graduate and disband
with such an indebtedness is another
much-debated question, and it is whis
pered that the faculty will take a hand
in the affair unless something is done by
the students to remedy the situation.
The professors who have such matters in
charge decline to talk on the subject, but
there are rumors that diplomas wi'l be re
fused to the '97 men and women until
they pay their bills, which are for ex
penses incurred in the publication of the
last "Blue and Gold."
Some members of the faculty are in
clined to regard tbe question as one to be
srttled by the class itself and with which
the officers of the university have nothing
to do.
On thÂ« other hand it is said that the un
paid debts are a burden that rests upon
the entire stud' nt body. The troubles of
'97 have already hnd a strong effect upon
the credit of '98. Many of the faculty are
therefore disposed to regard the debts as a
matter for faculty supervision, because
such liabilities if unpaid tend to hurt the
credit o! all future classes and thus injure
their enterprises.
Another puzzling side to the problem is
the question of wliat will be the creditors'
position. Next spring is the time for
graduation and dissolution of the class of
'97, so that after a few months there will
lie no class of '97 in existence. The big
creditors of the class are kpeping a sharp
watch on affairs and it is whispered that
there may be sensational steps taken un
less some money is raised by the seniors
before commencement.
Miners Organize.
BERKELEY, Cal., Dec. 9.â lnterest in
mines and mining by prominent business
men in Oakland, as well as professors at
the State Universi'y, has taken a sudden
plunge forward. Last night the Alameda
County Miners' Association was reorean
izeJ in Oakland, witn Professor Samuel B.
Christy, head of tne department of mines
at the State University, as president. The
Alameda County Association, which is a
branch of the California State Associaiion,
has existed for some time past, but only
in name.
The association is made up of about
sixty-five of the leading business men of
the county, nearly all of whom have a
greater or less interest in California mines.
They propose to have at their meetings a
series of lectures and talks on up-to-date
matters regarding mines. Among the
subjects proposed are: "The Cyanide
Process," Professor S. B. Christy; "Aurif
erous Gravels of the Pacific Coast,"
Charles O. Yale; "The Mother Lo ie."
H. W. Fairbanks; "Quartz Mining," E.
H. Benjamin; "Electric Power in Min
iner," F. \V. C. Hasson.
The officers elected were as follows:
President, Professor 8. B. Christy; vice
pre-ident, F. Chappelet; secretary, T. W.
Jeffre-s; executiv committeeâ E. H.Ben
jamin, Charies G. Yale, W. R. Thomas
and J. S. White.
At tbe university Professor Frank Sod le, |
head of tbe department of civil engineer
ing, is now carrying on a series of tests
and experiments in an effort to determine
ihe relative strength of various materials
for casings in mines. His experiments are
being confined chiefly to srÂ»cimens of
mountain pine and Oregon fir. Tests as
to their capability of withstanding decay
as well as their supporting qualities are
being made. A report as to his results
will be issued soon and copies will be for
warded to the various nime-owiiers of the
State.

STRIKE AT THE
ROLLING-MILLS
Over One Hundred Skilled
Workmen Walked Out
Tuesday.
A General Reduction in tbe Rate
of Their Wages Was
the Cause.
It Is Exp cted That the Diff rences
Will Bi Settled by Compro
mise To-Day.
A cut in tne wages of the skilled work
men in the Pacific Roiling-mills at the Po
trero has caused a strike, which has prac
tically suspended all operations in the big
iron manufactory. On Tuesday noon
about fifty men walked out, and their ac
tion cut off the means of employment of
about ri:ty others.
It is believed that some time to-day a
compromise will be effected and the wheels
of industry set in motion again.
For the past two weeks there have been
rumors that there would be a general re
duction of wages in the rolliue-mill, but it
was understood that the cut would not
take place until the first of the new year.
A we k or more ago General Superintend
ent Patrick Noble confirmed the rumor,
but the extent of the cut in wages was not
given out.
To tiie surprise of the men on Tuesday
noon they were informed that the cut had
been made a week ago Monday and that
for all that time tney had been working
under the reduction. Then they were in
formed of the new schedule. Nearly all
ihe woric is done by the piece at so much
per ton. The rollers who formerly re
ceived 32>^ cents per ton were reduced to
28 cents. This was equivalent to a cut of
$1 to $2 dollars out 01 ?6 per day. The
roughera were reduced from 18 to 15 cents,
or about 75 cents below ?3 50. The catch
ers were cut from 15 toll cents, or from
about $3 to $2 50; the second catchers
from 13 to 10 cents. The cut of the hotbed
men was from 12 to 9% cents, or from
$2 25 to $2. The same reuuetion was made
with the hook-up man. The small mill
men or hotbed boys were cut from $1 10 to
90 cents per day.
The 28-inch millmen have not been
notified yet of any reduction, so they are
sttli at work. There are fifteen of them.
These men are paid by the day, but with
them the day is very long at times. If the
work demands they labor from 7 a. m. to
7 and Bo'ciock in the evening, and no al
lowance Is made for vertime. The steel
workers, about 200 in number are not
affected by the strike nor have they baen
reduced in wages. About eight scrapiron
pilers were thrown out of work by the
strike.
It is the rule in the rolling-mill to hold
back two weeks' pay oui of the men's
wages, and tue men ciaim thi-re is one
week and a day's pay clue them besides the
two weeks' paj helJ back.
Probably the most important factor in
the strike was that the men learned that
they haa been working for over a week
under a new schedule of rates of which
they were ignorant. From all accounts
there will be no trouble whatever of a
violent nature. In the first phice tuer^
are no ironworkers ot this class on the
coast, and the places of the strikers could
only be fined by an importation from the
East. This is not likely 10 take place, as
the Eastern workmen receive as good
wages as the men here did beiore the cut.
The strikers are looking forward to an
early settlement, because they understand
that the rolling-mills has a contract to get
outa large quantity ol extra large street
car rails for a company in Los A-iiKeie*.
A part of the lot 13 already male. Yes
terday afternoon Superintendent Noh.e
met a number of thi> strikers in his office
and had a iriemJly chat with them over
the situation. No conclusions were reached,
and they purled with the understanding
that anotner conference wuid be held
this morning, when all parties hop-; to
compromise the caso and start up work
again.
The cause of the reduction in the men's
wages is Â»aid to be due to several causes.
In the first place, the Rolling-mills Com
pany claims that it is hard to compete
With Eastern firms in the same lines of
work because of the differ nee in the
prices of fuel there and here. In the East
the best anthracite coai, of which very
larire quantities are necessarily used, costs
about $2 50 per ton, whpre hero it costs
about $7 50 a ton in cargo lots at the wharf.
Another cause for the reduction is given
in this, tnat the company has not been
ninKine expenses. The company recently
changed Its fuel from coal to oil, which
necessitated extensive alterations in the
boilers and machinery. The oil tanks or
reservoirs also were very expensive. It is
said that the experiment wai a. failure and
cut a bijrhoie into the receipts.
Judging from all appearances there is
no very bad feeling oetween employer's
and employes, and while such continues
to be the case all look forward to a speedy
settlement of the differences.

THE HANDICAP
WENT TO CAPTIVE
Pat Dunne's Chestnut Is a
Racehorse in His
Way.
There Was the Usual Big Crush
at Ingleside, Ladies'
Day.
Woodchopper Was a "Good Thing"
That Faiied to Land -Moylan
Btaten in the Last Event.
The grand stand at Ingleside track yes
terday resembled the muchly vaunted
Adaruless isle of the southern seas. It
jieecied as though every woman not iu
vited to a sewing bee and every young
miss that had already picked out her
Christmas bonnet was present in the
grand stand. The day was beautiful and
warm, and there is little wonder that they
swarmed in droves to view the sport. The
favorites didn't all win, and of course
some pretty Hps pounted. Bernardillo
was mean enough to get beaten by Cande
laria, and George Cochran, quite a favor
ite with the fair sex, who had the mount
on Reddin^ton, lost caste by having his
mount beaded ouc by Candor, though in
the long run these little mishaps Were
overlooked. JSxcladiag Sport McAllis
ter's win, the other choices pleaded their
cause successfully.
Possibly the ring has experienced bet
ter betting days, but still the different
t ooks httd about all they could handle.
The firms that did not lodge the coin broke
even or beat the day.
Barring the second race Mr. Havey's !
starting was quite up to his fine work of j
the previous part of the meetiug. Numer- j
ous bail actors contributed to some of ths
tedious deiays .at tha post, for which the |
starter is blameless, although a battery
might work a change for the better in hi*3
assistant.
With eight or ten pounds more weight
on Captive the handicapper cou;d have
tossed bouquets at himself over the foot
lights. Pat Dunne's hooded chestnut
opened an 8 to 5 choice for t c mile and a
furlong event, but such a weird, wiid
punpe was made on Rev del Bandidos
that the ringw&s forced to close him equal |
choice with the conqueror oi Requital, â 
both beiiiK quoted at twos. Any and all
sorts of prices were laid against the six
other starters. Arter passing the stand
Installator took the lead from Captive
and Semper Lei and his chances looked
quite favorable as he led the bunch into
me stretch for the wire. Willie Martin
presently made his move on t; c back of
Captive, ami thundering on from second
place, where te had been loafing, the !
chestnut won, like the good one that he ;
is, by a neck in 1:55. Installator took the
place, a length ahead or Semper Lex.
With Lobeogula ineligible the opening
miie run was a rather easy thins for imp.
Miss Brummel. She went to the post a
2to 5 choice and won cleverly by three
}>ar:s of a length from Instigator in I:43}Â£.
On the strength of his good showing; in
last Saturday's stake run the Baldwin
entry Bernardillo was made favorite for the
two-year-old event over six furlongs, in ,
the interim Candelaria's Â«ood races Deine '
overlooked. Backed from 7to 5 to evens
thÂ« latter entry always held the Santa
Anita ranch representative safe, winning
easily at the end by three lengths. Bohe
mian Lass was a distant third.
It Jooked as though Keddincton and
Candor should fight it out for first place
in the hurdle event for maiden jumpers,
and as run the race showed the otners had
no chance. Redilington, carrying the Cor
rigan colors, went to the starting post a 6
to 5 favorite, with the black mare a
strona second choice. The pair had the
tiling to themselves almost from the
jump. After taking the la>t jump ihe
lavorite developed a tendency to bear in
toward the rail, and this failing cos: him
the race, for in a hard drive Candor beat
him out a head. Malo Diablo was a poor

bird. Sabilla and Tobey met with dis
aster during the progress of the race.
Duke Stevens was left at the post.
Woodchopper was a real live one yester
day to all outward appearances, and a stiff
play was made on him to beat Toa:io in
the seven-furlong dash that was filth on
the card. That artistic knight of t!ie pig
skin, J. Gardner, managed to have him
turned sideways when the barrier went
up, and he broke no bottles, although
heavily played at 2to 1. Toano, the even
money choice, led throughout, passing
the judges two lengths in front of San
Marco. Lucille, the Spreckels entry, an
outsider in the betting, was a fairly good
third.
Ed Corrigan's Moylan appears to be an
uncertain quantity. He was an even
money choice for the tinnl six-furlong
sprint, but the start didn't suit him and
he worked his way up from eighth posi
tion in time to finish fourth. In a drive
the 7 to 1 outsider Sport McAllister
headed out Ed Purser's Perseus, agaitist
which 6 to 1 was obtainable. Ricardo,
with 12 to 1 to show laid against him, fin
ished in that position.
Notes.
Just before the horses were called to the
post for the fifth race of the day, Willie
Martin was substituted forMacklin on the
back of Toano. Almost immediately the
odds acainst the old gelding were rubbed
from twos down to e\en money. He won
easily, and made quite a material differ
ence in the winnings of two or thrae
books, so it is said.
After the change in jockeys on Toana,
the heavily played Woodchopper receded
ia the betting, and many will always
wonder whether or not it had anything to
do with his bad acting at the posr.
The Tourist, a fine-looking colt by the
dead Wildidle, showed improvement in
his running yesterday. If looks go for
anything he should, certainly be heard of
in the future.
Al Shaw is riding in rare form, and any
of the Eastern importations in the way of
riding talent have yet to show that they
outclass him in any respect. He hustled
Sport McAllister along, making that
horse think lie was a stake animal.
Little Ciawson shows no bad effects
from his hard fall off the back of Red
tilenn some days ago. He finished a very
pretty ride astride the back of Perseus,
an>l evidently has a future before him.
Maynard and Swift, the iockeys who
took bad tumbles durine the progress of
the hurdle event, suffered no serious in
juries.

UNHAPPY HOUSEHOLDS.
Divorce Proceedings Keep the Judge*
of the Superior Court Busy.
The divorce suit o! Ange'.o Berretta
against Delia Berretta was on trial behind
closed doors in Judge Sea well's court yes
terday. In these days it is unusual for
divorce cases to be contested, but in the
present instance the strucgle is not over
the question of a separation but to decide
upon the division of about $60,000 worth
of property.
LUvorces have been granted by the
Superior Court as follows: Margarita
Isted from William Isted, for desertion;
Mrs. Wei thy A. Koster from .Louis H.
Koster, for infidelity; Charles M. Barres
from Mary A. barres, for desertion.
Divorce suits have been filed as follows:
Bessie R. D.bble vs. William I. Dibble,
Marian A. Trumpour vs. J. P. Trumpour,
Mary J. Reiily vs. Thomas W. Iteilly,
Elizabeth Ann Penrose vs. Josiati Pen
rose.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 10, 1896.
RAN AWAY WITH
HIS LITTLE SON
John S. Inglis of the Union
Pacific Railway Has
Fled.
He Left on Sunday Last for the
East to Avoid the Court's
Decree.
Would Not Pay Alimony or Give Up
Hs Boy to His Wi'e, Who
Sued for Divorce
John S. Inglis, the contracting freight
agent of the Union Pacitic Railway Com
pany, has disappeared from San Fran
cisco. He did not let even his best friends
know of his sudden leaving until he was
gone and safe beyond the State line.
With him inglis took his little son, who
has been the subject of a contest in the
Superior Court, so the flight has some
thing in it of a romantic nature.
The disappearance of Inglis was kept
very quiet until yesterday. Oa Monday
It was known only to one or two of his
friends, but it was not till yesterday that
the local agents of the Union Pacitic sys
tem knew that he had severed his connec
tion arbitrarily with the company, at least
in California, and skipped with his son.
For two days it was thought by them that
something had happened to prevent Ingiis
from appearing at the office on California
ins employment took hira away from
the office mucti of the time, for which
reason nothing was thought of his ab
sence. He traveled all over the State
making contracts with shippers, and also
in San Francisco with merchants. The
office received no word from him as to
where he was at work and when informa
tion was given yesterday recording his
sudden journey eastward the Union Paci
fic agents were the raosi surprised of all
me railway men who heard of it later in
the day, when the matter was discussed
among them on the stieet.
"Tlie whole siory is told in $ few words,"
said a railway agent who was an Intimate
of lugls for years in this City. "He
jumped his position to avoid paying his
wife alimony and to keep possession of his
little boy.
"Inglis became infatuated with a young
woman ncre â a girl of good family -and
their association became notorious. He
made a great mistake. He forsook his
wile for another woman, and is to blame
for all his troubles. He was the best con
tracting freight agent in California, had a
good income ana a nke home. His wile is
a charming lady against whom not a word j
can be said. But he ihiew everything over I
and at last in his stubborn way skipped I
rather than abide by the decision of the j
courts."
"Where is he now?"
The question was answered with some I
hesitation.
"He is out of the State, beyond the ju
risdiction of the courts, and 1 suppose that j
the expense of bringing him back in a civil i
suit would be so heavy there is little like
lihood of Inglis ever being hunted for.
It will be a JonÂ« time belore necoiues back
to San Francisco, if he ever does come here i
again."
Some time ago Ingiis sued his wife for j
divorce. He was unsuccessful, as the
court refused to grant a decree Riving him
the divorce. There was no proof against I
Mrs. Intrlis, so the case was dropped, i
Then Mrs Inclis brought suit for divorce ;
on the grounds of desertion. Inglis was !
ordered to appear in court yesterday j
(Tuesda\ v )with regard to the alimony, when j
he would be ordered to makp provision ;
for bis wife. Tlie Keeping of the son was i
nho to be considered. Rather tÂ»Â»Â»n sub
mit he got away from the jurisdiction of ;
the court Sunday, it is believed, on the !
overland train for the East, where he will j
resume his occupation with some railway, j
â
For Repairs to a Schooner.
Doited States District Judge Morrow ren
dered an opinion yesterday in the admiralty
case of C.J. Joreensen against Ellen it. Weth- j
erbee, tne owner of the schooner Mary Gilbert. i
In December, 1894, the vessel ran aground on i
the beach near the mouth of the Alseya River
in Oregon end Mrs. Wetherbee made a, verbal
agreement to pay Jorgensen for repairing the
damages and bringing the schooner to San
Francisco. He did no but the owner refused to
pay nil that was demanded, claiming that the
charge was exorbitant. Jorgensen brought an '
action to recover $735 40. A cross libel was
brought by Mrs. Wetherbee for - damages sus
tained by reason of negligence of Jorgenson
in his work. Judge Morrow dismissed the I
cross-complaint and cave a decree in favor of
Jorgensen for $ 313 75 and the cost of the ac
tion.

JIM ALL READY
TO MEET FITZ
Says He Will Not Need
Twenty Rounds to
Beat Him.
And Throws Bouquets at Him
self in a Letter to an
Olympian.
The Clever Boxers May Mfe'et H re
oa Febrnary 22â There Will
Be No "Long Green."
All that now remains to insure a boxing
contest between the two cleverest boxers
in the world to-aay is for Fitzsimmons to
Bay yes in reply to an offer from the
Olympic Club to meet Corbett iv this
City.
Corbett has accepted the proposition to
meet Fitzsimmons in a contest in San
Francisco. His last reply came yesterday
and it settles the question so far as lie is
concerned. And now if Bob Fitzsim
mons will decide to meet him in the roped
arena, votaries of the manly art of self
defense in this City will be assured of a
splendid scientific exhibition, the like of
which has rarely ever been witnessed in
the prize ring here or elsewhere.
There are two plans on foot at present
for the contest. One of them is to hold
the exhibition at Ingleside in the race
track inclosure under a monster tent, with
accommodations for 15,000 people at Jeast.
The other is to have it in the Mechanics'
Pavilion. The date has been set definitely
at February 22, so that it will be kept more
easily in mind as Washington's birthday.
Tnese plans, however, excepting the date,
are in embryo now, although a week hence
all will be determined, not only to the sat
isfaction of the Olympic Club and the
principals, but also to admirers of this
sport.
There will be no "long green" in this
event. That is already a settled fact, for
the character of tne men behind it guar
antees a square decision and an nonest,
sportsmanlike contest, which will surely
give satistaction to all interested in it.
Besides, such a decision under these aus
pices shall set at rest the question who is
entitled to the heavy-weight cnampien
sliip of the world. George A. Newhall,
president of the Olympic Club, and such
prominent members as Adolph Spreckels,
Major McLaughlin, William Greer Har
rison and others are interested in the con
test, since the Olympic Club is giving the
exhibition.
Mr. Newhall, who is also one of the
most enthusiastic members of the Horse
Show Association, stated last night that
the club's directors were eager to have the
contest here, and had settled on a plan
after the proper sportsmanlike fashion.
"This is what we have done so far,"
said he at the show. "We make the offer
to select a representative from ourselves,
and for Corbett to select his man, and
Fitzsimmons his representative. Tnen
those three agents would come together
and make their own arrangements. Their
business would be to determine all details
regarding tbe meeting of the champions
and to settle upon a referee.
â¢'We hove only talked about the propo
sition of holding the contest in Ingleside.
Whether it may be held there or in the
Mechanics' Pavilion has not been settled,
but anyhow that is a mere matter of de
tail. We want to have a scientific and
honorable contest for the championship
honors, and 1 believe that can be had by
our plan oi getting three representatives
for the three interests concerned. "
In a letter to a prominent member of
Ihe Olympic Club Corbett says:
You know that I have tried every means to
secure a meeting with. Fitz^iramon!Â». Now, so
lar as a finish fight is concerned, I am certain
that Stuart cannot pull one off in Texas be
cause tho authorities are determined to stop
any finish fight that may take place on Texas
soil. 1 spent at least $1000 going from place
to place when Stuart attempted to arrange a
meeting between Fitzsimmons and myself,
and the Coruishman Is well aware of the dif
ficulties that Stuart must contend with in
selecting a place of meeting free from inter
ference.
I am positive he cannot succeed, and that is
just the reason why I am so anxious that the
Olympic Club or some club ihal is in a posi
tion to give a good purse and a contest that
wiil not be interfered with, will get the match.
Now. it" Fitzsimmons is sincere and has the
least idea of ever meeting me in a fair field,
where no favors will be shown to either man,
let him say so, Â«nd I will guaruntee you tnat
Jim Corbett will be on time when he is called
upon to sign articles of agreement. Fitz will
not need a finish fight to decide this question
oi championship. The answer wiil be given
inside of twenty rounds or I am a very poor
judge ot pugilism and fighters.

SCRATCH
AND
SCREAM
My baby broke oat with a rash. He â would
scratch and scream. It would take two to bold
him, and one to put medicine on him. We had
to hold him sometime* an hour before we could
get him quieted down. All said that they never
saw such a face or body on any baby as on him.
I had to tie his hands tight in a cloth, night and
day, for five months. My sister had used CIJTI-
CUHA, and I began to use it. After only one
application, he lay down and eltpt as he had not
for a month, poor little fellow.- lie has not a scar
on him now, and is as fuir and his flesh is as soft
as any baby. While ho had this disease I had to
cut the sleeves out of his clothes, and put, gauze
underwear on him to keep him cool. \ I had to
keep pieces of soft cloth around his neck, it was ;
bo wet with moisture from the sores, and I had to I
change the cloths sometimes ten or twelve times
a day. Mrs. A. HAYNES, Lisbon, N. D.

Besides these events there will be other
races from scratch, and the usual record
trials. The programme is an interesting
one.
Walter B. Fawcett has crone to Fresno to
arrange for the meet to be held there on
Saturday, December 19.
The San Francisco Road Club's first an
nual party will be held this evening at
Union-square Hall, on Post street, and as
a cycling social function wiil be a big suc
cess.
J. W. Ramage of the Santa Rosa Wheel
tnpn is in the City on a short visit.
John F. Stayer, an Eastern professional
of some considerable jrominence, arrived
here yesterday from the East, and will
ride at the Velodrome Saturday. Stayer
has been seen here before. He has been
captain of one of the big pacing crews
which Jed Michael and Johnson in their
record-breaking trials, and is in splendid
condition to race.
The Velodrome management has done
nothing vet to "Bob" Terrill, though hav
ing threatened to refuse his entry because
he did not ride in the shield race last
Saturday. Terrill now feels a little piqued
himself, and would not- enter if they asked
or allowed him to. Neither will his
brother Harry nor Champion Wells.
These three "crackerjacks will be very
much missed in the events next Saturday,
aud it is generally believed the manage
ment has made a big mistake.
The annual meeting of the North Cali
lornia Division, Leacrue of American
Wheelmen, will be held Saturday evening
at the rooms of the Bay City Wheelmen.
The Bay City Wheelmen will have a run
to Sutro's to-morrow night. The club's
pool tournament has narrowed down to
four, Pike, Leavitt, Kellom and Menne.
The deciding games will be played this
week.
REMEMBERED THIS CITY
A. Â£. Sabatie Leaves $100,000
to the French Benevolent
Society.
He Was a Pioneer Importer, and
When He Returned to France Did
Not Forget San Francisco.
News has been received in this City that
A. E. Saba'ae, one of the early French
importers of San Francisco, and who died
about the middle of last month near
Bordeaux, France, has by his will left all
he possesses in California to the French
Benevolent Society in this City, less the
sum of $5000, which is to go to the French
Ladies' Relief Society. Mr. Sabatie's
holdings in California are valued at at
least $100,000.
The testator left California in 1873, but
toward the last days of his life remem
bered gratefully that he had laid the foun
dations of his fortune in this City.
After bequests to his sister, bis niece
and the widow of his old partner, to whom
he also gave the use during her life of his
<:bateau. he bequeathed the residue of his
estate to his native town of Lebourne,
near Bordeaux. He has a grand nephew
in this City. A. Comto and Mr. Green
baum, directors of the London, Paris and
American Bank, are executors of the Cali
fornia property.
The intelligence will be welcome to the
French Benevolent Society, which is
understood to be now burdened with a
debt amounting to almost exactly the
value of the beauest.
ST. IGNATIUS WINS.
Sacred Heart College Defeated at Foot
ball Yesterday Afternoon, Eight
to Nothing.
St. Ignatius College outplayed Sacred
Heart College at football Tuesday after
.ioon on the Central Park gridiron field.
The score was 8 to 0.
In team work, in knowledge of the
game, in line-bucking tactics and in their
ability to handle the ball without costly
fumbles, the men who wore one black and
one yellow stocking were evidently supe
rior to, as they were heavier than, their
opponents with the red and yellow striped
stocking's, and that is why they were
victorious.
Tbe playing at times was ragged, and
pailicularly when the Sacred Heart eleven,
after gathering in St. Ignatius' opening
kickoff, tried to work the ball back to the
center of the field. Quarterback Sapontes
o f Sacred Heart failed repeatedly, partly
through his own fault and partly through
the Clumsiness of his halfbacks, to get the
ball quickly and cleanly into ttÂ»e runner's
hand?, and every time the pass was poor
there was a bad fumble and a loss of
ground. The backs did not work together
sharply and accurately. Sacred Heart
paid the penalty. St. Ignatius finally
forced her back still further and com
pelled her to mate a safety touchdown
behind her own goal posts.
After that, however, the Sacred Heart
eleven pulled together somewhat and did
less fumbling, though the men were pow
erleÃs to prevent repeated gains through
their tacEles by quick bucks on the part
of both halves and the right guard of the
St. Ignatius team, who steadily worked
the ball back from near center to a touch
down that resulted in an easy goal.
Then did the St. Ignatius rooters in the
grand stand begin their jubilant â
Are we In it?
I should Binilel
In it, in it
All the while.
In the second half St. Ignatius was not
able to score againj although she kept tbe
ball in her opponents' side of the field and
at one time advanced to the six-yard line
after a futile but advantageous "try for a
field goal by Tiernan from the thirty-five
yard line. After several exchanges the
ball rested on the eight-yard line when
timo was called.
Very little kicking was attempted dur
ing the game and nearly all of the naif
dozen punts were made by Sacred Heart.
The playing, while not brilliant, was cred
itably sportsmanlike, free from inten
tional roughness and from injuries to the
participants.

each other, showing the strippedweight

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 10, 1896.
DIPHTHERIA IS
STILL SPREADING
The Disease Becomes More
Violent Every
Day.
Alarm Felt in the Health De.
partment Over the
Situation.
Twenty . Nine Cases With Seven
Deaths Reported Daring the
Past Nine Days.
As day after day rolls by and the num
ber of oases of diphtheria piles up, the
Board of Health becomes more and more
uneasy over the situation, and it is within
the range of possibility that the scourge
of the children will be declared epidemic
within a few days.
Such action would be exceedingly repug
nant to the members of the board, and
action in that direction has been deferred
in the hope that a change in the weather
would stay the march ot the disease, but
the situation grows worse every day, and
cases are being reported from localities
that, hitherto, have been free from diph
theria.
Five new cases, located as follows, were
reported at the Health Office -yesterday :
22 San Carlos avenue, 2605 Hyde
street, 427 Church street, 921 Alabama
street, Seventeenth and Clara avenue.
There was also one death from the disease
reported, that of a child living at 1438
Nebraska street.
What the board is principally worried
about is the fact that, as it spreads, the
disease is becoming more virulent, and
that the death rate is rapidly increasing.
During last month there were but 39 cases
reported in the entire 30 days, with 6
deaths, while during the 9 days of Decem
ber that have elapsed there have been 29
cases reported, with a total of 7 deaths.
Extraordinary precautions are being
taken to prevent the spread of the dis
ease, but it seems to jump from one local
ity to another without any apparent
reason.
Fumigation is resorted to in every case
ana the quarantine regulations are carried
out to the letter, but without apparent re
sults.
The district about the public sbools in
the Mission, which the Board of Health
attempted without success to close, con
tinuas to furnish some canes, but many
others that cannot by any means be
traced to these schools have appeared in
various parts of the City.
Dr. Soper of the Board of Education
called at the Health Office to report a case
ot diphtheria yesterday and stated that he
had heard of a new disinfectant that would
be of great benefit to th* Board of Health
in its efforts to stamp out the disease. He
asked the Health Offi<er trfgive it a trial.
THE HUDELSON LIBEL.
D. B. Woodworth Explains All About
the Valentine Mine in Pluinas
County.
The hearing of the libel suit agninst
Benjamin F. Hudelson was continued in
Judpe Campbell's court yesterday after
noon. The courtroom was crowded.
D. B. Woodworth, the complaining wit
ness, asked that his son, Tod Woodworth'
be permitted to give his evidence as to the
mine to show that it was not a myth and
the request was Granted.
Tod Woodworth, wno was 20 years of
age last June, testified that he was an
assayer. At the request of his father he
made an examination of the Valentine
mine in Plumas County in November,
1895, and made a report of the same. The
mine is a free niilline; quartz and the
assays showed about $6 to the ton. His
father had an option on the mine, the
price beinp $60,000.
D. B, Woodwortb, before his cross
examination was continued, asked per
mission to make a statement in regard to
the General Gates alleged blackmail.
He read an agreement which showed that
Gates bad a one-third interest in a mine
and liad paid the money to him legit
imately. Then he entered into a long
explanation as to his career in tne Cana
dian Parliament.
In his cross-examination he denied that
he was arrested in this City on a boat by a
constable from Faunas County for "beat
ing" his landlady, and did not register on
the boat as General Gates.
Instead of answering questions directly
he entered into a long explanation as to
the offer to sell the mine to John D.
Spreckels. the understanding as given to
him by Owens being that if an expert to
be sent to the mine by Mr. Spreckels re
ported favorably the deal would De con
summated, the price being $55,000, Owens
to get $5000 more as commission. On
April 10, when he, Rev. D. M. Ross and
Owens went to Mr. Spreckels' oflice,
Owens eot the papers from him at Rev. D.
M. Ross' suggestion, and disappeared with
them.
They waited for two or three hours but
did not see Mr. Spreckels. He went back
and saw Mr. Kyle, who told him Mr.
Spreckels had not been in the building
that afternoon. He denied that Kyle de
nounced tne mining scheme as blackmail.
He denied t tiat he asked Hudelson at any
time to help him to eet Mr. Spreckels to
purchase the mine, and if he did so that
H. F. Marshall would make an affidavit
that his previous affidavit was false. He
admitted going to The Call business of
fice on the night of April 14 to see Mr.
Shortridge, but was unable to do po.
The defendant Huctelson testified that
he first met Woodworth in December,
1895, Rev. D. M. Ross introducing them.
He did not see him ngain till either
March 30 or 31, and he was accompanied
by Ross. M. T. Brewer was present and
the talk turned upon Marshall, Brewer
denouncing him as a rascal for trying to
make trouble between him and Hudelson.
That afternoon Woodwortb and Ross saw
defendant again at his office, and after
some conversation about Marshall, either
Ross or Woodworth mentioned a mining
project, and it was the lirsttime defendant
knew that Woodworth was interested in
mines.
A i this point the case was continued till
this afternoon.
Roberta Quickly Acquitted.
Patrick Roberts, charged with failing to call
the name of Congressman Maguire on two
tickets, while acting as an election officer in
the Tenth Precinct of the Thirty-third Assem
bly District, on the 4th ot last month, was
acquitted by the jury without leaving the
box in Judge Wallace's court yesterday. Rob
erts offered testimony to show that there were
marks for Congressman on the tickets which
he was accused of miscalling, but was not re
quired to go tnrough with his proot, as it
developed by Attorney Guilfoyle that he was
extra clerk, and not legally responsible tor
the discharge of the duty which he was per
forming. The prosecution was therefore
abandoned and Roberts was at once acquiutd.
Japanese Libel Caie Dismissed.
The Indictment for libel against S. Yamato,
editor of the San Francisco Dally Japanese
Times, who accused T. H. Asano ol evil acts,
has been dismissed by Judge Belcher.

BUCKET-SHOP MEN
IN THE EXCHANGE
They Are Not Welcome,
and When Discovered
Are "Fired."
What Secretary Friedlander
Has to Say About Atkin
son's Case.
The Broker Attempts a New Definition
of What Constitutes a
Bucket-Shop.
"It is absurd to say that Thomas T.
Atkihson is not conducting a bucket
shop," said Secretary Friedlander of the
Produce Exchange yesterday. "Nobody
will say so, I guess, but himself or the
parties interested witn him. There are
no other members of the exchange sus
pected of being engaged in that business;
the roll of membership is clear. No Pro
duce Exchange anywhere tolerates such
concerns. What is a bucket-shop? Sim
ply a concern that trades in the fluctua
tions of contracts rather than on wheat or
other commodities. They do not contem
plate the delivery of goods at any .time.
It is distinctly stated in their contracts
that delivery is intended, but that is only
a blind in order to get around the law.
They do not intend it. There were two
other concerns who were notified at the
same time as Atkinson, but they had
sense enough to accept the situation and
acknowledge the corn. They told us not
to suspend them and they would get out.
We said 'All right.' They disposed of
their seats and that was the end of it.
Atkinson, however, made a fuss and
wanted to draw fine line 3 between oper
ating a shop and takinu orders for a shop,
for he is agent for the concern. Every
exchange in the country geta rid of these
people as fast as they appear in the mem
bership. This board has simply followed
the general law, which is also, of course,
a law of this exchange."
Thomas T. Atkinson, speaking further
in his own defense, said yesterday that be
objected to the term ''bucket-shop" be
ing applied to the business of Wheelock &
Co., which firm he represents at 623 Mar
ket street. Hb said that the comments
made in The Call of Sunday last were not
correct, although so intended, that
bucket-shops in general and in the ab
stract are fraudulent schemes to trap the
unwary and that such a game is played in
two or more ways â viz.: that the confid
ing subscriber should be induced to de
posit some very considerable sum on rep
resentations of large profits or that a
similarly constructed victim should take
stock in a "firm" promising still greuter
profits to be derived from the business
thereof, with the certain resultâ total loss
or bust up, and on the latter point there
was and still is "one" such firm deservedly
denied the privileges of the United States
rcnil and all correspondence to or from it
is mnrked "fraudulent" and returned.
"Wheelock & Co., at their main and
branch offices," he said, "receive constant
and bona-fide reports of actual market
conditions, and so daily make press re
ports, and while under due restric
tions they allow their clients to
boy or to sell grain or stocks at latest
quotations; they do not receive any
moneys under pledges to invest and in
crease. Every customer must act as his
opinion directs.
"Chicago is the great grain center, as New
York is of stocks. By the enterprise of the
Chicago Board of Trade the entire crop of
tho United States (wheat) is sold and resold
some 100 or more times yearly. By the
lack of enterprise the ban Francisco board
can and does only so trade on the crop of
California some three times yearly.
Wheelock and Co. ana their branch offices
exiend to the truding public on perfectly
honorable terms the opportunity to par
ticipate in a live market at actual current
rates instead of being confined to a market
which is virtually if not actually con
trolled by three or four persons and firms.
Wheelock & Co. stand ready to receive
or deliver either in Chicago or New York
any grain or stocks called for by any or
all of their contracts; have done so repeat
edly, but thoy also extend to tneir clients
the right to close a trade when their judg
ments so dictate.
"I have been a stockbroker for some
twenty years, nnd still believe in my own
integrityâ when convicted of fraudulent
practices I am willing to die, and that
without a request 'to bury me decently.' '*
GRANGERS' BANK WILL PAY.
