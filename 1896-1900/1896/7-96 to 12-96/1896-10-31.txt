The Bsar Club float is intended to be

The bear is the largest' Alaska grizzly

ago, upon his arrival in America, Bn
yakar assisted in tbe celebration of Mc-
Kinley's election as Governor of Ohio at
Columbus. There he became personally
acquainted with, the apostle of protection,
and since that time the man of Canton
has had no warmer admirer than his
Turkish friend. In Saturday's parade the
Turks will have a place in the line to
tnemsel-ves, with a Turkish float at their

The Market-street Railway Company
will stop its whole & J em when the great
parade moves away,' ni the point of ren
dezvous. Tiiis, it ii Conceded, will be ab
solutely necessary, for no streetcars could
pass through the crowds that will be in
the principal streets of the City to-day.
Market street will first of all be cleared of
its streetcars, and then there will be an
open path for the sound-money parade.
At every crossing and junction time
keepers and special officers of the com
pany will be stationed. It will be their
special duty to keep the cars running reg
ularly before and a'ter the dead stop takes
place. This precaution is taken so that
people may not be discommoded if they
wish to pass from one part of town to an
other either before or after the parade.
The street railways will run as closely
as possible upon the ueeis of the proces- ]
sion. But no further arrangements have
been made, and in fact no official instruc-

THEY ARE FREE VOTERS.
Southern Paolflc Company's Em
ployes Win Parade In Force.
The following document is a sufficient
reply to the charges made by Democratic
hand oreans to the effect that employes of
the Southern Pacific Company hare been
forced to take part in the parade: .
AN APPEAL TO THE VOTERS OP SAN FRANCISCO
COUNTY.
We, the undersigned workingmen and voters
of San Francisco County, hereby appeal to all
citizens of San Francisco County to unite with
us in defence' of our wages, our homes, the
prosperity of our State and the honor of our
country.
We are the employes of the Southern Pacific
Company. It has been asserted, not once but
many timeis, that in advocating the cause of
noncst money in this campaign we are being
"coerced" and "intimidated" by our superior
officer?. It has been charged that we Are
guided in our political actions by subservience
to the company's interests and fear of offi
cial displeasure. This is not only totally false,
but it is a gross and gratuitous insult to our
manhood and intelligence. We are men, not
cowards. We aro citizens, not slaves. We re
se.nt the Insult whico Is offered to us and pro
pose to show our resentment at the polls.
We shall vote as a unit for sound money and
we shall do It because, of our own free will
and judgment, we are convinced that the free
and unlimited coinage of silver at the ratio of
16 to 1 weuld be injurious to our individunl
Interests as wage-earners, detrimental to the
welfare of the State and disastrous to the
United States as a Ration. We have not come
to this decision unthinkingly. We have
reached the conclusion which we have delib
erately, and having reached it we earnestly
appeal to our fellow-citizens to stand with us.
The free coinage of silver at a ratio of 16 to
1 must result in a depreciated currency and a
cheap dollar. The saver advocates confess as
mucn when they claim that the prices of all
commodities would rise'when measured in our
coin. .We do not want cheap dollars.. As in
dividuals we are entitled to good dollars for
dur good work. As a nation, this best country
on eanh is entitled the best ourrencv.
The depreciation ot our silver coinage must
inevitably drive all Â«oid out of the country.
History proves this and nobody denies it. All
our debts abroad are payable in gold only. To
pay these debts would tatf twice their face
value in 50-cent dollars. If, as a nation, we
tried to pay these debts thus doubled In value,
it would be certain bankruptcy. If we did not
try, but insisted on paying every debt dollar
lor dollar in our depreciated coin, it would be
repudiation. We do not wish to see the Na
tion a bankrupt, nor do we wish to see the
Stars and Stripes flaunted before the world as
i an emblem of repudiation and a badge oi com
mercial dishonesty.
Thirty-five years ago, when Lincoln called
for troops, the railway men of the W W est re
sponded so that many of the railroads could
hardly be operated. Tne danger which threat
ens the country to-day is, we earnestly believe,
no less grave than it was then; and once
again, we as railway men propose to respond
to our country's call.
We appeal to you to gtand by us. We appeal
to you as our friends and comrades and as fel
low-citizens of a land that we all love. There
is no "enemy's country" in the United Btates.
We are all one people whatever State we live
in or whatever our callinK may be, and we ajp
peal to youâ we call on. you, we implore youâ
to stand shoulder to shoulder with us now.
We ask it for the sake of our country. We ask
it for our own sakes to protect our own
wages, our livelihood and our homes. We ask
it, too, for your sakesâ in behalf of your own
business, in behalf of all the industries and
commerce of the American people. We appeal
to you to vote fer sound money, for honor and
prosperity.

McKINLEY CLUB RALLY.
A Grand Wind-Up of a Successful
Campaign in the Forty-First.
There was a grand rally of the McKin
ley Club at Pixley Hall, corner of Pacific
avenue and Polk street, last night. H. C.
Pirebaugn, president of the club, pre
sided, with Captain John S. Daley at the
secretary's desk.
After a 'few preliminary remarks Mr.
Firebaugh opened the meeting by intro
ducing George W. Elder, nominee for
Street Superintendent.
Mr. Elder cited his record as a proof
that when elected the Street Superintend
ent's office will be conducted in the inter
est of the taxpayers, with a saving of $400,
-000 a year.
William duff, the popular merchant
and father of the Forty-first District Re
publican Club, was received with cheers.
lie made a telling speech on the duty of
the Republicans to support not only Mc-
Kinley, but also E. F. Loud and Henry
C. Dibble, who will carry out the prin
ciples of the'} arty, the one in his seat in
Washington and the other in Sacra
mento.
T. V. O'Brien spoke on the grand his
tory of the Republican party from its in
ception up to the present time as being
the unalterable friend of the working-man.
H. C. Dibble spoke of the action of the
Republicans of the district in supporting
him for the Assembly, not because of
himself, but the principles of the party
which he represented. He unmercifully
scored his quasi-Republican competitor
who had been a member of the club, but
had afterward bolted with no other inten
tion than trying to elect the Populist
Cator to the United States Senate*
W. S. Schooler spoke on the issues now
before the people. He was followed by
O-car Lewis, who scored Governor Budd
tor his duplicity in advising the Bryan
men to participate in to-day's parade,
and then rote for Bryan.
County Cominitteeman C. (Â£. Clinch and
Thomas H. Knox made short addresses.
The vpnerable ex-captain of police,
John Short, on being introduced, pro
duced his ticket as he will vote it. on
next Tuesday, It was a straight Repub
lican score from beginning to end. He
stated that "this was his sixty-eighth
year as a voter, and, with himself, there
were eleven- votes in his family, all of
which were similar to the one exhibited."
A resolution was adopted ratifying the
entire Republican ticket, but more es
pecially Eugene F. Loud, H. C. Dibble
and Henry Steffens, tlie latter fcr Super
visor for the Fourth Ward.
SOCIAL VICTORIA ;
GIVEN A SHOCK
Sir Isaac Campbell Runs
Away With a Coy
Maiden,
Captured by Detectives at Port
land and Returned to His
Home.
HE IS SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD.
Mother of the Young Nobleman Almost
Distracted by Worry Over His
Escapade.
PORTLAND, Ob., Oct. 30.â Sir Isaac
Douglass^CampbeJl, a -17-year-old youth
belonging to one of the most distinguished
families in Victoria, disappeared from
home last Friday night with a consider*
able sum of money and in company with
Miss Jeanette Bowser, one year his senior.
The Victoria police, learning that the
coupie were here, sent Detective Redgrave
after the young man. He arrived yester
day.
Bb Isaac and the girl registered- at the
Imperial Hotel on Tuesday, but left there
on Wednesday, ostensibly to leave the
city. Detectives â  Welsh and Simmons,
who were detailed to assist Redgrave, took
a different view of the situation, believing
that the couple were yet in town. At 4
o'clock yesterday afternoon Detectives
Welsh, Simmons and Redgrave were walk
ing up Washington street.and when reach
ing Sixth they perceived a young couple
emerging from the side door of the Cactsi
saloon.
"There tbey are," excitedly exclaimed
the English officer. . .
In the twinkling of an eye Detective
Simmons was on the box of. the coupe, or*
uering tne driver, to take bis passengers
to the Central police station, and at the
same instant Detective Welsh joined the
couple inside.
"My God, sir, wisrt has happened?',
shrieked the affrighted young, woman in
a musical voice. Sir Isaac and his com
panion were assured that no harm would
Defali them, and upon reaching the eiliee
of the Chief of Police, Detective Red
grave, who followed the coupe afoot,
stated that the only person he wanted was
Sir Isaac, wbom he desired to return to
his distracted mother, after the young
scion of nobility had squandered almost
S5OO in his spree of less than a week'^ du
ration. .
"What made you run away with Sir
Isaac?" asfced Detective Welsh of Miss
Bowser.
"Well, you know," said she, "when I
was coming away oh the steamer he was
on the dock and asked me if I would let
him come with me. He's such a nice do}',
you know," addea she, with a bewitching
smile and a merry twinkle in her lustrous
black eye, ".that. I hadn't the heart to re
fuse him. So we cU rve here together, and
that's all there is to the story."
An hour later youn<- Sir Isaac, in the
custody of Detective Redgrave, was being
whirled out of town on-.a Northern Pacific
train en route for Victoria, where presum
ably a spanking awaits him from his
mother. Miss Bowser was placed in a
cocpe and sent to her lodgings.
Tnylor and McKinley.
A meeting of the United Labor party was
held last evening on Market street across from
tne Pavilion. A monster crowd was present.
W. P. Grace was chairman and made the prin
cipal address. He eulogized Colonel Charles
L. Taylor for Mayor, and the applause which
greeted every mention of his name was limited
only by the limits of the crowd. A vigorous
poem was read by J. W. Emerton, the first
verse of which was well received.
, Cheered " The Call."
The Plumed Knights marched with
torches and flags last nigbi down Market
street and when opposite The j Call b*si
ness office halted and gave three rousing
cheers for The Call.

Chauncey M. Depew Assists
Major McKinley at
Canton.
Colored Voters, College Students
and Schoolboys Among
the Visitors.
ALL FOR TRUE REPUBLICANISM
Three Thousand Litt c Lads Show
Patriotism by Carrying the
Stars and Stripes.
CANTON", Ohio, Oct. 30.â The uniqne
features of the day in Canton were the
visit and speeches of Chauncey M. Depew
and the gathering of several thousand
â 'â¢school children at Major McKinley's
house late this afternoon. Mr. Depew
."was warmly weJcorned and, spote twice,
;â â¢â  once to a colored club and once to college
students, wbo came from various parts of
tlje country to pay their respects to Major
MeKinley. The speech which McKinley
made to the students was one of the most
carefully prepared ha has delivered this
. week, and it was listened 10 with the deep
est interest.
The visit of the school children was a
â¢ beautiful incident of the closing days of
: the campaign. Three thousand boys
marched in line, each one carrying a
small flag. The" small girls witn ' their
mothers were clustered in dense groups.
When the Doys marched up they waved
their handkerchiefs, and the lads shouted:
"Hurrah, hurrah, McKinley is the man;
I can't vote, but daddy can." The air was
filled with the Piusic of the fresh young
voices. The boys cheered lustily for sev
eral minutes, and tlien three small boys
mounted the stand and told Major Mc-
Kinley that all the boys were for him, and
ii was the main regret of their lives that
they were not old enough to vote. It was
dark when the children, after listening to
McKinle'y'a pleasing,fatherly talk, marched
away behind their bands and corps.
Tile first delegation to-day was the origi
nal Colored Republican dub of
Cleveland. It was the fifth original Mc-
Kirvley club that has visited Canton.
There were 530 voters in the party. J. E.
Benson was the spokesman for the col
ored men, and Walter Brooks, president
of the club, introduced the members of
thechib to the major. Major McKinley
addressed them very briefly.
At the conclusion of his remarks Major
McKiniey introduced Chauncey M. De
pew to the audience. Hundreds of citi
zens who had learned of Mr. Depew's
visit at the house of the Republican can
didate had assembled at the McKinley
residence expecting a speech from the
widely known orator, and ihe crowd that
surrounded ttw porch r.umberod 1000.-
As Mr. Depew stepped forward some one
proposed- "Three cheers tor New YorK,"
and they were given witn a great deal of
Vigor. Mr. Depaw, bowing his acknowl
edgments, spoke as follows:
I came here to pay my respects to Governor
McKinley and not to make a speech. My
speec: -making does not begin in Ohio until
.to-morrow. I feel that T oupht not to make
an v speeches in Ohio anyway, and the reason
is thiit I want the State of New York to give a
larger majority in proportion to its popula
tion than any Slate in the Union. Arid if by
any charce my coming here should lead to
. Ohio beating vÂ«, 1 don't know whether I could
'": live in New YorÂ» again or not. Anyway I
â¢-â¢-' can move to Oaio. [Laughter.]
It afiords me great pleasure, on arriving
â  'heTe at this spot, which will be one of the hls
.' â¢â¢; toric places oi the country for all the future of
" .". our history, to fin 1 that the first delegation of
...;â¢' tbÂ« thousands of delegations that have visited
â  .'.Canton, and of which we read in Near York,
'â¢â shoukl be a delegation of colored men, and I
".â â¢â¢ say lor this reason: It has pleased the Popo
c-atic party, or rather the Popocratic leaders,
to place this campaign upon a plane on which
; it has never been put before in tiiis coun.ry.
â _ They are trying lo array one class againÃt nn
. ether class, as if 'here were classes in this
â  country, or permanent classes. They are try
â  in^ to army the employed against their em
ployers and to array the man who has not
. prospered against the man who has prospered
a little more than he, as if it were the spirit of
â ; .American liberty that a man should not rise
.- 'irom one condition to a better ono where all
â .ire equal before the law.
If any one has a right to complain and the
: â â  right to be an anarchist or a socialist it is the
;'. colored man. It is only one generation since
}ie came from his slavery to be a free men, but
one never saw a negro socialist nor a negro
; . anarchist. [Cheers.] Tne colored people of
Vthje tailed States accept the emancipation
â¢.'proclamation of Abraham Lincoln as it was
. given to ihe world. They accept American citi
.. zenship as iÂ» came from the pen of the great
liberator and greatest American, citizenâ that
â â¢all men are created equal with one another
â  and with inalienable rights; that no maa is
: â¢' better than another before the law, but all are
... equal. This is American opportunity unaer
â j.' American iibttrty. So It is that the colored
â  men of this country, this generation which
has'g'one to our schools and received Ameri
.-.can education "Jind is enjoying American op
portfinities, are ail for McKiniey, prosperity
Â°. and liberty.
Three cheers were given for Mr. Depew.
A few moments after Mr. Depew finished
speaking a delegation of college students
from various parts of the country marched
inlo the McKinley yard. Tney were fall
of enthusiasm and rent the air with their
college yells. W. F. Wolfe, editor of the
College Republican, spoke in behalf of the
Harvard men in the delegation, and Evi
ward Henning lor the college league
clubs.
Responding to these addresses Major
McKinley made the principal speech of
the day. He said:
I am glad to b2 assured by your spokesman
that in the contest of this year, in Which tbe
Nation's iionor and integrity are involved, the
college men, not only of the East, bat of the
â¢West, teachers and pupils alike, are with us,
in heart and purpose.- I know, young gentle
= men, you are earnest Republicans and appre
ciate most highly your support of the Repub
lican cause.
If you were not Republicans from convic
tion, however, and were guided alone by en
ihns auic ardor, I would say to you, in the
words of Webster, "Study the Constitution of
the United States thoroughly; contrast its
teachings with the doctrines of the political
parties of tho day and vote with the one you
then believe will do the most for your coun
' try." fTh'e Republican pany can well afford to
k submit to that test. It never has shrunk from
I the severest test of the past, and has never
I Miffered thereby. But in the alignment of
I artics to-day, and the vital questions at issue
between them, it especially and cheerfully in
vites compaiison and contrast. It has nb aim
but the public good and the honor of the
American name, and confidently submits its
contention not to a class or section, but to tbe,
" whole American people.
Mr. Depew was introduced again by
Major McKiuiey and he addressed some
remarks to the students.
Major McKinley drove to the station
with Messrs. Depew, Georee .W. Smalley,
correspondent of the London Times, and
Myron E. Herrick of Cleveland, who ac
companied him. returning in time to ad
dress several thousand school children.
Haskell Koons, aped 33, introduced Robert
Jeannero, aged 12. who spoke for the
primary and intermediate departments,
and William Kahn, who spoke for the
high school pupils. Major McKinley ad
dressed the children.
Mr. Depew will speak at Cincinnati Sat
urday night. Starting from Cleveland at
7:3ointhe morning he will make short
speeches at Wellington, C estline, Galion.
Delaware, Columbus, London, Spring
field, Dayton and M.ddletown.
HUES' RtPLY TO ALTiiEVTi.
-Un tied Slat* Troops ' Here Held in
Jlrndinmajor Corrj,itcs. .
WASHINGTON, D. C. Oct. 30.â 1n re
ply to arguments in Governor Altceld's
speech in Cooper Union, New York,
October 27, in relation to the Debs riots in
Cnicago, where he said that the United
States troops were ordered to be in readi
ness five days in advance of any. trouble
witn a view to force employes to work for
their employers, a statement is made with
the approval of General Miles, who com
manded the United States forces on the
occasion in question and with his indorse
ment of its accuracy as follows: ,
The hordes or so-called armies or Coxey were
organized in Kansas, C alifornfa, Oregon and
other State* and formed across the country, in
some cases seizing trains :or their transporta
tion and living upon the people of towns, vil
lages and communities in their route. Fol
lowing this the employes of the Northern Pa
cific struck and practically held possession of
the road when it was not earning running
expenses. The same thin? was done on the
Great Northern, ihe strikers holdins posses
sion of the propeityfor weeks regardless of
the law or the riehtsof the property-owners.
Strikes occurred in nearly all the mines be
tween the Alleghenies and the Rocky Moun
tains. In many instances the property was
seized and unlawfully held regardless of the
civil authorities.
Following this, in May, 1894, a strike was
ordered in the Pullman works in Chicago, and
when that business was paralyzed a sym
pathetic strike was ordered on all the rail
roads over which the Pullman cars moved.
This was in June, and according to Governor
Altgeld's own statement in his Cooper Union
speech all freight trains in certain parts of
Illinois were abandoned by the employes and
prohibited from moving by the strikers.
Trains were ordered sidetracked by the hun
dreds and the passengers were practically held
prisoners for weeks.
The interstate commerce of the entire coun
try west of Chicago was suspended by the end
of June. A few mail trains were allowed to
run, but in many instances every window was
smashed. In some instances the operators
were brutally treated.
This was the condition of affairs on the last
of June. Under the laws of Congress It was
the duty of the President to protect the inter
state commerce, the mail routo, the sub-Treas
ury at Chicgo, containing $20,000,000 of Gov
ernment money and other D ited States prop
erty. When the mail and interstate commerce
lines were obstructed and paralyzed, it be
came the duty of the United States court to
take action, which it did, although the lives
of the United States Marshals were threatened
and they were unaole to carry out the lawful
orders of the court. It was then and ..n t until
then, that President Cleveland ordered Fed
eral troops to protect United States Marshals
in the lawful exerution of their duties and
also to protect property under the jurisdiction
of the United States authorities.
At the same time the leaders publicly de
c'ared that "It was no longer a strike, but a
rebellion." When the United States Marshals
nuder protection of .the Federal troops had
opened the lines cf Interstate* commerce and
mail routes and protection had been obtained
for the property under the jurisdiction of the
United States the troops were removed to
their former stations July 18. Hence they
were in Chicago only fifteen days and ''.id not
in any way interfere with the municipal or
State authorities. The strike, however, was
not declared off until two weeks later. This
demonstrated clearly that the Federal authori
ties had nothing whatever to do with the so
called strike. Neither had they anything
whatever to do with the questions between
capital and labor.

NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 30.â The
Union Veterans' Patriotic League closed
its campaign work to-night by a great
meeting at Carnegie Hall. One of the
features of the meeting was a portrait of
General Grant, furnished ,by his ' son,
Colonel Fred D. Grant, and which was
unveiled at an interesting moment. .
â  General Horatio Porter presided at .the
meeting. There was great "cheering as the
veterans appeared on the platform. Gen
eral Porter said: ' â  â ', '\ â¢;
: "As these men went; to the front in
1861 to save the Nation's life, they are
going to the polls next Tuesday to help to
save the. Nation's ; honor. In this crisis
our opponents are disregarding all law
and trying to bring about that condition
of things which is the absence of all law
and is known oniy by that most abhor
rent language. in the Enclish tongue â red
handed anarchy." .'" â¢ ... * â  â¢'
â¢;', General â  Porter . then referred â to Major
McKinle3*, whose s name received an ova- j
tion. "Some men know our candidate as
Major McKinley, others as Governor Mc-
Kinley, but we know him as Comrade Mc-
Kinley. On the other side "we see Bryan
flirting vigorously with Sewall and Wat
son, neither of whom know what time the
engagement will be broken." . . ,\ â¢
General Porter then said the Bryanites,
had insulted the dag in -Missouri, Illinois
and Chicago. â¢';â¢â¢ '-'-â¢;. ';;' .'.â 
"We read in the papers to-day," said he,
''that the Bryanites tore down the flag in
Chicago and trampled and spat upon it.
[Cries of "Shame."] -. â¢; -
"The time has -not yet come in this
great Republic to substitute partisanship
for patriotism or dynamite for law. We.
are sitting here to-night under the inspira
tion of Ulysses 8. Grant, our .-:â  great
general." ' " ;*Â«
There was great cheering at this and the
flag' which was in front of General Gram's
picture was drawn aside. The entire
meeting cheered enthusiastically.

TRIUMPHANT TOUR
Throughout Indiana Great
Throngs Greet the Ex-
President.
In Al! Sections of the State the
Voters Determined to Elect
McKiniey.
DEMOCRATS ARE DULY WARNED
Cannot Cast Ballots for Bryan With
out Assisting Watson, the
Populist.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ihd., Oct. 30.âGen
erai Harrison started on his second stump
ing tour of the State at 9 this morning.
A crowd of several hundred people were
gathered at the station, and Harrison was
greeted with the wildest cheers. His train
made its first stop at Greenfield at 9:30.
, He spoke to a crowd of 5000 and was given
an ovation.
ANDERSON, Ikd , Oct. 30.â At Knights
town Harrison spoke to an enthusiastic
audience of iO.OOO people. Anderson was
the next stopping place. The crowd was
estimated at irom 25,000 to 30.000 people.
FORT WAYNE, Jnd., Oct. 30.â At Win
chester, where nothing of very great mag
nitude Had been expected, General Harri
son encountered one of the greatest dem
onstrations of the day. The people beean
to pour in early in the morning, and by
the time the big parade started the mana
gers of the demonstration estimated that
from 20,000 to 25,000 peoDle were present.
On the way to Portland the party was en
tertained by the "Goldbug" Glee Club of
Winchester. A momentary stop was
made at Rideeville, where General Harri
son bowed his acknowledgments to sev
eral hundred people who had gathered at
the station.
Portland was scheduled for the longest
stop of the day and the event was made a
general rally for all that section. A tent
holding 8000 people had been provided for
the meeting, but not one-tr.ird of the
crowd could get into it. A hundred young
men with Bryan badges went to the sta
tion to close in behind tne train and
cheer for Bryan when Mr. Harrison ap
peared.
They let co a few cheers about ten min
ules before the train arrived and the vast
multitude closed in upon them with a
rush of such momentum that three or
four of them fainted. They were carried
from the crowd and no more interruption
of the proceedings was attempted.
A burst of tremendous cheering and
waving of hats started when General Har
rison appeared and waved along the
crowd as far as could be seen up the
street. The multitude moved slowly after
the carriage as it moved out to the field
where th^s tent nas pitched and people
were found packed for ttfly yards around
it- Finally General Harrison and party
succeeded in reaching the stand and he
was introduced by the county chairman,
jJ. C. L. McAdams. General Harrison
spoke at some length and with . great
! earnestness, taKing up in turn each of the
j more important issues of the campaign
| and discussing them.
Speeches were mads at Geneva and
Berne, where General Harrison talked
briefly to several hundred people. It had
become dark by the time Decatur, county
seat of the densely Democratic county of
Adams, was reached. A crowd of about
4000 people was gathered about the sta
tion, where a stand had been erected.
General Harrison was given a warm-recep
tion, though a number of cheers-for Bryan
were heard. In his speech here General
Harrison went over the. history of the Re
publican party in making good the prom
ises of the Government in resuming specie
payments, and declared that the Demo
cratic party had faced completely about
on the money question in four year 4, quot
ing the platform of 1892 and recent
speeches of Bryan in support of the asser
tion. : â¢ â¢ '
The principal part of his speech, how
ever, was in dealing with tne question of
lusion. He - told his old Democratic
friends of Adams County that they, could
not vote the straight Democratic ticket
this time if they wanted to.
"For whom do you expect to yote?." : he
asked* "For Bryan and Bewail?' You
cannot do it If you should carry Indiana
five of your electoral votes would go for
Thomas Watson of Georgia, who is not a
Democrat, and does not claim to be a
Democrat. They have live Populists upon
your electoral ticket, and if you yote it
two-thirds of your vote goes to Bryan and
Sewall, your . ticket, and one-third of it
coes to Bryan and Watson, the Populist
nominees.
"And if Thomas Walson should hold
the balance of power in the Electoral Col
lege, you would have Watson for Vice-
President or nobody. You, who have
been taking tbe straight thing lor all
these years, cannot get the straight thing
thisyear by voting the Democratic ticket.
But you can vote a straight Republican
ticket, and thereby uphold many of the
principles for which Jackson and Jefferson
stoodâ principles that are now attacked
by Mr. Bryan and the Chicago platform."
The train was considerably behind time
and a fast run was mada to Fort Wayne,
which- was reached at 6:15, only a few
minutes late. Here General Harrison
rested quietly in his car until 7:30 o'clock,
when tbe Republicans of Allen County
gave one of the biggest demonstrations
that have ever been known. A night
parade that required a couple of hours in
passing was given, followed by a speech of
neariy an hour's length by General Har
rison in a circus tent that had been pro
cured for the occasion.
FORT WAYNE, Iwd., Oct. 30. -Ex-
President Harrison closed his first day of
campaigning in Northern Indiana in Fort
Wayne 10-night. The ex-President and
his pany will Jeave in the morning for a
tour of the counties northwest of here.
Tbe platform from which- Mr. Harrison
spoke here to-night broke down under the
great crowd upon it and precipitated the
ex-President to the ground. Much con
fusion ensued, but no one was injured.

cratie JltcKtnley Club.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 30. â Chairman
Hanna spoke to-day at the noon meeting
of the Democratic McKiniey Club and
was received with much enthusiasm.
Among other things he said:
'I am happy because I am prepared to
congratulate you npoa this victory al
ready assured. The part l tiaye taken in
this campaign was hut little. It is you
and the citizens who love their country
who have made the victory certain. I
wish to say that when I return to my
home in Cleveland and hear the shouts of
victory Irom ihe sound-money hosts in
this city over the Jong-distance telephone
I will shout with you."
Among the other speakers were Chair
man Hahn and Perry Heath. Mr. Hahn
said he looked for a majority of 100,000
votes from the citizens of Chicago for Mc-
Kinley.
MISERY AND STARVATION.
It Causes an Impoverished Pole to Try
to Murder His Family and Cut His
Own Throat.
DETROIT, Mich., Oct. 30. âAn at
tempted murder and suicide this morning
led to the discovery of a pitiable case of
destitution and misery. Mrrtin Lubin
ski, a native of Poland, lives here with his
wife and two children. He is a cripple
and unable to contribute anything to the
support of the family.
His wife has gone out to work and until
recently was able to earn enough money
to enable them, to live. Recently, how
ever, she lost her work and there was ab
solutely no income. Tne family had been
so poor for a -long time that they had
nothing to sell or pawn, and for the past
weeK they have been on the verge of
starvation.
Hunger and despair seemed to have af
fected Lubinski's mind, and he decided
that it was better that all should die
than that they should live on in misery*
Early this morning while his wife and
children were still in bed he arose and pre
pared for his murderous work.
The first his wife. knew of his intentions
was when she found him standing over
her with a keen knife in his hand. She
was not as anxious to give up the struggle
as was her husband. She sprang at him,
but he eluded her and made an effort to
get at the two children.
The frantic woman succeeded in head
ing him off again. She was physically
greatly his superior, and he seemed to
realize that fact and abandoned his at
tempt to kill her. Suddenly, before she
realized what he intended to do, he drew
the knife across Imown throat, cutting a
deep gash from which the blood spurted
in a thick stream. He stood for a moment
and then fell to the ground.
His wife at once went to his assistance.
She called for. help and did what she could
to stop the flow of blood. She succeeded
so well that the.doctors now say that Lu
binski will pro Da Dly. recover. Charitable
people in the city have already interested
themselves in the case and will see that
tb,e family is supported.

MEETING HUNTINGTON'S TRICKS.
Lines in the Western Clearing- House
Association to Outwit the South
ern Pacific.
CHICAGO, 111.. Oct. 30.â The advisory
board of tne Western Immigrant Clearing
bouse has abandoned its efforts to reach an
agreement with the Southern Pacificin
the matter of commissions on this class of
business. A division of the business was
proposed, but the Southern Pacific asked
too large a share. It was then proposed
to- maintain agreed rates of fares and com
missions, but the Southern Pacific in
sisted that commissions be paid to
European agencies not only oh tbe busi
ness in which it was directly interested,
but on that ticketed to intermediate
points in which it has no interest.
When negotiation^ were broken oft the
clearing-house 'roads.' decided they would
reduce commissions, which are now $15
and $16 a ticket, to. ss a ticket, and thus
throw on the Sunset route the. responsi
bility for the continuance of the present
demoralization. Should the latter road
persist in paying the old commissions
some plan will be adopted by its competi
tors to meet the competition, but just what
method-will be adopted is not yet an
nounced.
A commission on immigrant traffic has
practically been agreed upon between the
trans-A'.lantic steamship companies and
trunk lines and Western roads, in which
the Southern Pacific is ignored. The de
tails of this arrangement has not yet been
arranged, but should they prove satisfac
tory to the lines affected tbe new method
will be put into effect January t, .
An agreement has also been reached in
the matter of handling immigrant busi
ness coming via Galveston, and this.busi
ness will, be divided among the roads run
ning out' of Galveston.
TRAPEZE PERFORMERS FALL
Thrown Violently to the" Stage and Badly
Injured by the Breaking of a
. . Rope.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 30.â Prominent
in the specialties incidental to the "White
Crook" 'at the Olympic Theater is the
trapeze and horizontal bar act of Edward
Coloy.and Frank Dewitt. .
Colby was balancing himself across the
crossbar, twenty T nve feet above the stage,
to-nigh.t. Dewitt was just beneath him.
The audience, still as could be, was wait
ing, when there sounded through the
building a sudden sharp snap, like tho
crack of a revolver. The rope of the trap
eze parted.
Th 3 two performers crashed to the
stage and lay motionless. Tne screams of
the women, the shouts of men, the rush of
some of the- aunience to the doors and of
others to the stage followed the fall. The
stage manager, George Curtiss, and others
ran in and carried the two performers to
ihe wings. Then the momentary panic
betran to subside. Within ten minutes the
spectators beheld with applause a girl
sinner, and had apparently forgotten the
accident. In the meantime the perform
ers were taken to' Harlem Hospital. Five
toss of Colby's foot were broken and he
was badly shockel. Dewitt received
severe internal injuries.

CONSERVATIVE MEN
PREDICT VICTORY
Impartial Estimates Made
by Republican State
Chairmen.
California Placed in the Column
for Protection and Sound
Money.
MAJOR M'KINLEY CANNOT LOSE.
Even in Texas the Silverites Will
Be Beaten by an Honest Ballot
and Fair Count.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 30.â The Republi
can National Committee received reports
from State committee chairmen in re-
SDonse to the call sent out by Chairman
Hanna for the latest and most conserva
tive estimate of the result. Presidential,
State and Congressional. Following are
extracts from these reports:
Arkansas â Results will be substantially
the tame as Septemb r 2. No hope of
electing Republican Congressmen. Vote
will be slightly increased over September
2. Hope to get in the Republican column
in 1900.
Californiaâ l have not the slightest
doubt we will win the electoral vote in
this State.
Coloradoâ Bell, the Populist Congres
sional candidate in the Second District,
and Shafiotb, silver Republican, in the
First, will win. Bryan and Watson ticket
will poll 6000 votes, Bryan and Sewall
95,000, McKinley 50,000.
Delawareâ Result as to Presidential
electors doubtful. Hon. D. M. Wilson of
Dover says we will win Presidential elec
tors, but cannot say as to Congressmen.
Maineâ We will give at least 50,000 plu
rality for McKinley.
Massachusettsâ Hope to cast 390,000
votes. Predict Republican plurality of
150,003. Congressional districts are sure
except Ninth and Tenth. These two are
in doubt.
Mississippiâ There will be 65,000 votes
cast, of which Palmer will g j t 3000, Mc-
Kinley 11,000, Bryan and Watson 1500,
Bryan and tie wall 36.0C0.
North Dakota â McKinley electors will
be elected by 50,000 majority. Candidates
for Congress will run even with electors.
Populists and Democrats claim tbe State
by 3000.
Oregon â Confident the Republicans will
carry the Slate by 3500. Situation grow
ing more hopeful every day.
Texas â Last night it was authoritatively
stated on the basis of the registration that
there will be 525,000 votes cast. Some esti
mates mate it as high as 595,000. This is
an increase of 100,000 over the highest pre
vious vote. The increase is largely in our
favor and Democrats are discouraged over
it. It is reasonably sure we will get a fair
count.
Wyoming â We will carry Wyoming for
our Congressmen by 5000 plurality and
Justice of the Supreme Court by the same.
The margin on electors is too close and
changeable to make a close estimate.
Michigan â F. E. Waite, member o'f State
Executive Committee: Trend is all our
way. I believe we are safe for 35,000, and
We may get 40,000 or 50,000.
Floridaâ No doubt about Florida going
for Bryan. Democrats will get 20,000, Re
publicans 12,000, Pajmer 3000, Populists
2500. May possibly elect one Congress
man.
Idaho â Idaho's vote will be cast for
Bryan. The Dernocratic-Populistic-silver
ticket wiil get two-thirds of the vote
polled. The three candidates for Con
gress have an even chance. We hope to
elect our men. We will carry enough
legislators to hold the balance of power
with the Populists and Democrats. In- ,
dilations point to a Democratic successor
to Senator Dubois. He is practically out
of the. race.
lowa â Complete poll indicates 75,000
Republican plurality. â¢ Chances are it will
go above this.
New Hampshireâ We wjll carry this
State by 20,000 majority and will control
the Legislature. â¢ .*.â ,""â¢'
Pennsylvaniaâ Pennsylvania will give
McKinley 250.Q00 plurality. Bryan will
get 400,000 votes.
Minnesota â Minneapolis will give Mc-
Kinley 5000 majority. Later reports make
me raise my estimate of the majority in
the State from 25,000 to 30,000 and proba
bly 35.000. The last poll shows a majority
for McKinley of 35,710.
Idaho has been placed by recent Repub
lican estimates in the list which might go
for McKinley, but the foregoing report,
which was approved by the National chair
man, concedes the State as sure for Bryan.
Colonel riahn, whose duties as head of
the speakers' bureau department, are
practically ended, received the following
.telegram to-day from National Commit
teeman Scott of the New York headquar
ters:
"Shake, old man. We will give you New
England, Pennsylvania, New York, Mary
land, New Jersey, North Carolina, Vir
ginia, West Virginia and Tennessee."
Colonel Halm said that he did not
yield North Carolina and Tennessee in his
estimate given out to-day, because in the
rjrst State there was complete fusion of
the Democrats and Populists, and in Ten
nessee he was afraid there woulu be &
repetition of the alleged counting out of
H. Clay Evans.
Chairman Hahn of the speakers' bureau
of the National Republican Committee to
day gave out a statement claiming that
McKinley would receive 314 electoral votes
from tbe following twenty-nine States:
California. Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois,
Indiana, lowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine,
Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Min
nesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New

DENVER, Colo., Oct. 30. â Reports
from Kansas and Eastern Colorado state
that there is likely to be a severe loss
among the range cattle, owiug to a bliz
zard that has been blowing for a day.
Snow has fallen over the entire country
from Olathe, Ivans., and west of McCook,
Nebr. This had been preceded by rain,
that froze on the surface, and then tne
short grass was covered by the snow, that
drifted at a furious rate.
Last night a general blizzard ensued,
and correspondents are of the opinion that
when the storm abates many cattle will
be found off their range and dead in the
drifts.
NEW ORLEANS, La., Oct. 30. -A tor
nado visited this city yesterday afternoon
and destroyed $100, 000 4 worth of property.
The Skylott cotton sheds, situated on
Robin street, near the river front, used by
the Texas and Pacific Railroad for cotton
storage, were damaged to the extent of
$10,000. A number of the sheds were com
pletely destroyed. George Bealer, a switch
tender, was seriously injured, an arm and
hip being broken ; and Joseph Hennessy,
a laborer, was also injured at the sheds.
All the other laborers, about forty in num
ber, having just knocked off work, for
tunately got out of the sheds before they
collapsed.
News comes from Tensas Parish that the
storm did great damage there to property
as well as killing six negroes.
In Lafayette County, Miss., great dam
age was done to property.
RUSE IX WHKAT PRICES.
Hot Due to Speculatortf but a Shortage in
the H'orld't Cron.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Oct. 30.â John
Hyde of the Department of Agriculture,
author of the recent report on "'wheat
prices," brands as a lie the statement that
he had given it as his judgment that the
present rise in wheat had been planned by
speculators. Mr. Hyde declares that if
ever there was a rise in prices that was
strictly legitimate, it is the present rise in
wheat. Advices received from Russia,
India and Argentina report such short
crops in those countries as to make a bier
shortage in the world's supply a matter of
absolute certainty, and, notwithstanding
the oscillation Of the last few days, Mr.
Hyde looks for still higher price*. Specu
lation, he says, is usually mest active
when, as at the present time, impossibil
ity of ascertaining full and precise effect
ot an important cnange in conditions
leaves soma little room for doubt or specu
lation as to the near future, but it is either
the greatest folly or most criminal men
dacity to sa}' that present speculation in
wheat is itself the cause of the rise in
prices. Those who make such statements
are proving themselves false frienas of the
fnrmers?, because, if the present rise is
fictitious, it would be clearly to farmers'
interests to take immediate advantage of
it, whereas every legitimate indication is
to the effect that farmers will do better by
not crowding their wheat onto the market
just at this lime.

AN EXPLANATION
Attempts to Answer All of
the Charges Made r
Against Him*
.Neither a Member of the A. P. A.
Nor the Junior Order of
Mechanics.
JUST A PLAIN PRESBYTEEIAN.
Did Not Vote Against Public Schools
Because H; Opposes Such In*
stitutions.
MADISON, Wis.. Oct. 30.â Mr. Bryan
to-night made the following statement to
a representative of t!ie United Associa
ted Presses accompanying him:
I have not attempted to answer all of the
misrepresentations which have been circu
lated in this campaign, but in these closing
days I feel that it is necessary to call your at
tention to an attack which has recently been
made by the enemy. I find that the Republi
cans are. circulating among Catholic citizens
'the Charge that I am or have been a member
of the American Protective Association. I
have also learned that T have been accused of
being a member of a society which I think is
known as the Junior Order of American Me
chanics.
At the same time I have been accused in
other quarters of being opposed to the public
school and having voted agains; the teaching
of the English language in the public schools
of New Mexico. Whi.e I have attempted to
confine my discussion of public issues to the
â  questions raised by my platform and have
considered the money question as paramount
to all others, I take this opportunity to ex
plain my position upon the religious contro
versy which has Deen raised, and ask the
United Associated Presses to give the matter
publicity.
' "I am not and never have been a member of
the American Protective Association, or of the
Junior Order of American Mechanics, or of
any other society hostile to any church, re
ligion or race, nor have I ever applied for
membership in any such organization. While
I am a member of the Presbyterian church I
have always believea that there should be no
religious teÂ«t applied in the holding of public
office, and I have not allowed religions aiffer
ences to affect my conduct in the discharge of
the duties of -public office. lam a believer ia the
public school system. I attended public schools
myself, and my children are now attending
public schools. While I recognize the right oi
parents to send their children to private
schools and colleges, if they so desire, I believe
' that the fiee pub:ic school must remain a pnrt
oi our system of government, in order that the
means of education shall be within the reach
of every child in the land.
The Democratic members of Congress voted
ag&ir.st a proposed amendment to the consti
tution of Xew Mexico which compelled the
teaching of the English language in the public
Bchools, not because the Democrats were op
posed to public schools or to the teaching of
the Englisti language in such schools, but be
cause they did not deem it necefsary or wise
to require a pledge from the people
of New Mexico wnich had not been re
quired of the people of other Ter
ritories seeking admission. I trust that
what I now say may reach all of the voters,
because it is tne only opportunity I shall have
of meeting these misrepresentations. I trust
that those who support the policies set forth
in the Democratic platform will not allow
themselves, to be alienated from my support
by any affidavits which may be circulated by
political enemies. I have tried so far as I
could to conduct this campaign in an open
and honorable way, and have insisted that
those who are with us should refrain from
personal criticism. of my opponent and leave
the people to rass judgment â¢"upon the prin
ciples which we represent.
WA&BBVRVB BOLD BLUFF.
Boasts That the Povulists Will Elect 3lr.
nrynn.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 30.â The following
final statement from the Populist side as
to election-day probabilities and expecta
tions throughout the country was given
to-night to th.c United Associated Presses
by Chairman Washburn of tbe Chicago
headquarters*
"In view ef the fact that the peode are anxi
â¢ .ous to know what combinations of States are
liable to -win, I have grouped together several,
\.\ any group of which is liable to be the correct
one on election day. It is conceded that the
â¢ Democratic gold desertion will be offset by the
â  silyer Republicans, which leaves the normal
condition of the two parties the same. Then
add to the Democratic vote ihe 2,000,000 of
Populist votes and it is apparent that Bryan
must win. Fortunately ihe Populist vote is
largest in ihe States where .it is most needed,
and whi;e Bryan cannot wan without it, he is
sure to win with it ana will get the full
vote.
In analyzing the vote of the country I have
- grouped as Bryan States ihe agricultural and
c mining States, where the gold Democratic de
fection and floating vote is smallest, and
where the succoss ot thru ticket depends on
the farmers who have been educated on the
silver question through school-house and al
liance meetings, and who would feel insulted
if offered a price for their vote or were coerced
in any manner. Therefore. It is conceded that
the thirty-one States west of the Mississippi and
â outti of the Ohio River, representing 242
electoral votes, or eighteen more than needed,
â¢ are the-States which Bryan is mostly to carry,
'and the States which are comparatively sufe
for McKinley are the six New England States,
together with New Jersey and Pennsylvania,
representing eighty-one electoral votes.
The doubtful States are the Middle Western,
including Ifiinois, Indiana. Michigan, Ohio
and Wi-consin, together with New York mat
ing 124 electoral votes. It is apparent to any
political student that while Bryan can be
elected by haii a dozen different combina
tions, on the other hand McKinley must
carry every Eastern State, together witn every
one of the Central West doubtful States, In
order lo win. Therefore he has one chance
where Bryan has six. While Bryan can win
without tne' doubtful States, his chances for
carrying them are better than McKinley's,
and should he get them all it would prove to
be a veritable landslide. Of the thirty-one
Bryan States the most doubttul are lowa,
Kentucky, Delaware and Maryland. We can
lose lowa and Delaware, or Kentucky and
Delaware ot Maryland and Delaware and still
win without carrying a single doubtful State
in the Middle West. We can cive McKinley
all ot the Eastern and Middle Western cr
doubtful States, together with lowa or Ken
tucky or Maryland and Delaware, ana then
win.
Of the doubtiul States Ohio-is most likely to
furnish the greatest surprise. The silver' R
epublican vote will be enormous. Our most
conservative reports of Illinois, Indiana and
Michigan plve these three States to Bryan.
Now concede the other three doubtful States-
New York, Ohio and. Wisconsin â and we can
afford to lose Kentucky, Wyoming, Maryland,
Delaware, Nebraska, North Dakotn, Oregon,
West Virginia, Minnesota and lowa and still
win. Again, we can carry Indiana and Michi
?an, whicjv are sure for Mr. Bryan, and lose
llinois, Ohio, New York and Wisconsin, and
in addition to all this give them Kentucky,
Maryland, Delaware, N'Â»rth Dakota, West ViVi
ginia and lowa and all the Eastern States, and
we can still win. Ihere are several other
combinations which include States naturally
for Bryan and whicn in a like manner would
enable him to win.
In Illinois Bryan will carry the 6tate outside
of. Chicago by between 30,000 and 40,000
majority. The uncertainty Is Chicago with
its 100,000, unplnced votes. If Bryan carries
this city hecWhl carry the State, aud no com
bination can beat him in the rest of the States.
In former years the floating vote could be
bought, but there was only one or two pivotal
States. While It is possible to buy the floating
â¢vote of a single State, it is not possible to buy
up the whole Nation. Then, attain, in former
years the floating vote was indifferent to the
. results. This year every man has strong con
victions and will secretly vote them in the
booth, whether he takes any money or not
Possession is nine points of the law. Bryan
has already enough States to win, with more
than an equal chance in the doubtful States,
and only ireeds to hold his own. He will be
our next President.
WASHINGTON, j;. C.Â» Oct. 30.âSena
tor Butler, -chairman of the National
Populist Committee, returned to Wash
ington this evening from his trip to In
diana And Illinois. He said to a reporter
for the United Associated Presses that he
found things politically better tban even
on his previous trip to "Chicago a fort
night ago.
"Indiana and Illinois, Michigan and
Minnesota," he saM, "are sure to- go for
Bryan, and I think Ohio is back in the
doubtful colnmn, with the chances of a
Democratic victory."
The Senator said he was in Chicago one
night â¢while Bryan was there, but the
crush about the Candidate wherever he
went was so great that he did not attempt
to see him. '.'He had only one meeting'in
the'eity and that lasted all ihe time he
wa3 there," said Mr. Butler. "Although I
did not see Mr. Bryan, I heard from him
and know he was looking and feeling well.
I know nothing about his fainting or col
lapsing to any degree at one of his
speeches in Ciiicago.^and do not believe
the story to be well founded."
The Senator said aa-ain that he did not
intend to make Mr. Watson's famous let
ter public.
I'AL,Mi:R AXD BUCK MiIi ISSULTED
Bryan Clackers Fail to Show Proper
Respect to the Generals.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Oct. 30.â The Palmer-
Buckner special train arrived this morn
ing at 7 o'clock. Bombs and bells pro
claimed the arrival, and a large crowd
gathered around the platform near the
depot, where a ten-minute speech was
made by General Buckner, amid much in
terruption by Bryan adherents. Stops
were made at various points between
Hannibal and Sedalia. Large crowds
assembled at each station. The greeting
was at several points wanting in proper
â¢espect, and cheers for Bryan were given
everywhere. At Paris a soldier who bad
served under Buckner at Donalsonville
shook hands with his old general, saying,
"I surrendered under you once, general,
but I won't do it again."
At Fayetteville tbe shouts for free silver
were so furious and long-continued that
attempts to speak were abandoned. A
larg- crowd assembled at Jefferson City at
3 o'clock this afternoon, where the prin
cipal stop of the day was made. Special
trains from outlying towns brought in
many people. Both generals will meet
again in St. Louis to-morrow morning.
General Palmer speaks at Music Hall in
the evening-, while General Buckner goes

liourke Cockran tipeaks to Brooklyn
Sound- Money Men.
BROOKLYN, N. V., Oct. 30.â Under the
auspices ot the Manufacturers' Associa-
tion of Kings and Queens counties the
Hon. Bourke Cockran in the Academy of
Music to-night spoke on "Good Govern
ment and Sound Money" and was given
an ovation. The, building was packed to
it 3 utmost capacity. After discussing the
financial question at length, Mr. Cockran
said:
We will face this danger of Populism as we
have faced the danger of secession. We will
no more surrender our honest system of money
than we are wi'.ling to allow the siave power
to dominate the United States. The men who
to-day massed behind this ropuiistic pro
gramme are the men who attached every form
of society; they attack everything on which
civil society depends. The Supreme Court,
which interprets tbe law, the executive ikat
enforces it, are both equally the objects of us
Nothing which the American people have
given to the world, no fruit of Republican in
stitutions, is comparable lo that system which
the power of all men to attack the rights of
tne citizen, is barred by the Supreme- Court
when it transcends the points which the con
stitution declares to be the limit of Govern
mental Dower. Alone among tne nations, of
the earth we have given to civilization this
system, which has proved itself a bulwark
and the defense of Democratic institutions.
The Populist raves against it, raises his
hand to destroy it, criticizes it everywhere,
seeks to proyeke aguinsjtit the animosities of
the vast majority of the* people.
In 1861 ihis Government ti,as subjected to a
strain from which few men believed it would
ever recover. Yet the question of 1861 was
merely the extent of the jurisdiction to be
recognised in the Federal Government.
I have no fear of tbe manner in which the
answer shall be made. If the only question
before this people were the defeat oÂ£ Mr. Bryan
I would not be here to-night, for that is'ac
complished alreadyt lam glad this issue has
arisen. I want to see the answer to the ques
tions of the hour made so emphatic that it will
be long before American patriotism again re
ceives an audacious challenge.

Denies Thai He Said McKinley Would
Carry Illinois.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct 30.â The disp&tch
cabled from Chicago yesterday to the Lon
don Chronicle by its special correspondent
intimating that Senator Jones admitted
McKinley -would carry Illinois met with,
a firm de nial from the Senator to-day acd
the correspondent acknowledged that the
chairman. had made no direci. admission
of Bryan's defeat. Senator Jones said:
"I told the correspondent we were not
sure of carrying Illinois for Bryan; that I
believed he would get a majority of 10,000
to 20,000, but McKinlÂ«y might set more.
I said we did not need Illinois, in order
-to elect Bryan President, but I conceded
nothing to' McKinley. The correspondent
jumped at his own conclusion."
CarlisU** Campaign Closed.
LEXINGTON, Ky., Oct. 30:â Jtfhn G.

Tom Watson's Disgust.
SANDERSVILLE, Ga., Oct. 30.â Tom
Watson spoke here to-day to a full court
house, many Populists having assembled.
His speech was devoted to a running ac
count of Democratic deeds from his stand
point, and an attack on tbe Wilson bill
and its sugar feature. He said he had not
been treated fairly in the matter of fusion;
was out of the race, so far as Georgia is
concerned, and told his followers to take
their choice of Bryan and bewail or Mc-
Kinley and Hobart, or refrain from voting.

Gardas, president of the American Na
tional Bank; W. A. Geralt, cashier; W.
H. Renaud. Julius Keifer and T. Thorn,
directors, for having received deposits in
the bank after they knew it to be insol
vent. These indictments are the result of
the recent bank panic in New Orleans.
The American National was the first of
the four banks to go down, ,and the
wretched condition of affairs exposed by
its failure caused a panicky feeling and
a run on the other banks.

HOW HAS BRYAN
Gold Badges Conspicuous
Everywhere That Willie
Went.
Republican Parades Set Upon
by Adherents of the Boy
Orator.
LIVELY FIGHTS IN A CROWD.
At One Town the Nebraskan Misses
an Elaborate Open Carriage Sent
to Receive Him.
MADISON, Wis., Oct. 30.â Mr. Bryan
began his Wisconsin campaign this morn
ing at Green Bay, where hfl arrived at
half-past 8 o'clock, after spending three
hours in his special car on a siding near
that place. No incidents occurred on the
run from Chicago. Between 6000 and 8000
people braved the raw morning air that
came with chilling force across Lake
Michigan ana slood around the tempo
rary platform in Whitney Park to near
Mr. Bryan.
Gold men were quite prominent on the
streets of tha town and cheers for McKin
ley were heard. At first the audience was
like the atmosphere, but H warmed up as
Mr. Bryan proceeded and became exceed
ingly enthusiastic.
Green Bay was the home, of Ofiver
Howe and apropos of his view on the in
come tax back in the '70' s Mr. Bryan
talked about that feature of the Chicago
platform, holding that only the people
with large incomes were against its enact
ment.
Ten minutes at La Pere were devoted
to telling a couple of thousand people
something about the money question.
Kaukaunana came next and another ten
minutt speech was made by the candi
date. His audience numbered about 2500.
About 6000 people composed the gather
ing that greeted Mr. Bryan at Appleton.
Tney showed considerable enthusiasm.
The neighboring towns of Jforah and
Menasha held a joint demonstration in
honor of the Democratic candidate at the
latter place. Gold badges were again ia
evidence among the 2000 people whom
Mr. Bryan addressed.
A number of prominent Wisconsin
politicians joined Mr. Bryan at points
along his ruute. Some of them were W.
C. Siiverthorn, Democratic nominee for
Governor, T. B. Lamoreux and ex-
Congwssman Milier. Clinton Babbit, also
an ex-Congressman, accompanied tbe
party from Chicago.
General Bragg, leader of the gold Demo
crats in Wisconsin, resides at Fond dv Lac,
and apropos of that fact Mr. Bryan had
something to say of the gold ;novement
to 10,000 of General Bragg's iellow
townsmen.
Few of the orange ribbons, that badge of
hostility to Ihe cause of free silver, were
seen in that big audience stretching back
of and on each side of the candidate as he
stood on the rear platform of bis private
car. Considerable enthusiasm was mani
fested, and Mr. Brvan warmed up in his
talk. He referred "to the fight fpr dele
gates to the Chicago convention, and said
that just before the convention met a dis
tineuished gold Democrat of York
announced that he was going to Chicago
to carry the convention for gold. [A voice:
"Was that Dave Hill?"]
"No-; that was W. C. Whitney," replied
Mr. Bryan. "He said that notwithstand
ing the fact that a majority of the dele
gates were already instructed, he had no
doubt that when the Democrats of the
â  West and South found cut how the Demo
crats of tbe East felt there would' be no
trouble about carrying the convention
against silver,- which was simply saying
that the men who went there instructed
would betray their constituents and vote
against what their constituents demanded.
Bnt, my friends, when the convention met
we had a scene that will to. memorable in
the history of this country. [Cheers. ]
These delegates who came instructed
could neither be driven from tbeir in-,
structions by threats nor drawn by per
suasion, but they carried out tbe will of
the people who sent them there, and that
Democratic convention was the most
democratic convention that this Nation
has seen for twienty-five years.
A short stop at Oakfield was utilized by
Mr. Bryan in shaking hands WJth the
crowd there. Gold ribbons in plenty were
seen among the couple of thousand in the
throng at Chester, but cheers for Bryan
were given heartily. Fifteen minutes at
Juneau were spent in making a speech to
3000 people. An address purely argumenta
tive, in which Mr. Bryan showed much
vigor, and earnestness,' was made to an
audience of about 2500 at WatertowD.
There was nothing new in his speech.
A good-sized crowd beard Mr. Bryan at
Jefferson. Then came Fort Atkinson,
where the "yellow fever," as the Demo
cratic nominee calls tbe display of the
Republican color, was present.
A regular rough, and tumble scrimmuge
like an oldtime election row occurred at
Janeaville just before dark. The crowd
there, was large, 6000 strong. Just after
the candidate had begun to speak a Mc-
Kinley flambeau club in uniform, headed
by a band, attempted to march through
the thickly-packed gathering about the
rear platform of the Idler. Naturally
much confusion was caused in the throng,
but above it all Mr. Bryan could be heard.
Some of those who tried to hear the candi
date became excited at the continued con
fusion caused by the McKinley men and
made objections to the interruption. In
dignant remarks came from those stand
ing by Mr. Bryan's side and John Winans,
chairman of the Rock County Democratic
committee, who bad introduced him,
shouted out something about "giving them
as good as they send."
Somebody grabbed a banner borne by
the Republicans labeled "Sweet Sixteen
to One â Nit," and the trouble began.
Energetic Democrats made a rush at their
political opponents. Fisticuffs became
general, pictures of McKinley were torn
down and the offending banner also went
to earth. The battle was over in a mo
ment and as things quieted down Mr.
Bryan made some comments on the inter
ruption. The McKinley club had marched
to the station to take a train for Rockford,
where they were to attend a Republican
demonstration, and it is claimed it could
reach its coaches only by going through
tbe assemblage listening to Mr. Bryan.
Evansville turned out a large crowd and
Madison was reached at 6:50 o'clock.
The usual throng of enthusiaetic silver
ites did not greet Mr. Bryan on his arrival
in Madison to-night. A couple of hun
dred people only were at the Northwest
ern station when his train came in and
the brass bands and marching clubs did
not get there until after Mr. Bryan had
started out for the big building known as
the Gymnasium, whqre iiis first speech
was made. A gaily decorated open car
riage, drawn by four horses, proceeded
leisurely to the depot to get the candidate,
and in doing so passed a modest looking
closed back. Mr. Bryan was in the hacÂ£.
It all came about through a change in his
plans and the failure of those in charge of
the canpidate's special to notify the local
committee.
Mr. Bryan was scheduled to arrive at 8
o'clock. During the day it was ascer
tained that he could not make the connec
tions to enable him to keep bis lowa en
gagements to-morrow unless he left Madi
son at 8:30 to-night. The train was ac
cordingly run ahead of time and reached
here at 6 :50 o'clock.
The meeting addressed by Mr. .Bryan
was held indoors, for the night was chill
and cold. â¢ He cut his speeches short, and
was able to leave at 8:30 over the Illinois
â¢Central to carry out his lowa programme.
In .the Gymnasium a standing audience
that crowded that spacious hall to the
doors heard him. His second speech was
made to another large crowd in the As
sembly Chamber of the State Capitol.
BIGGEST BONA FIDE ELECTION BET.
Stratton's Wager of One Hundred Thou-
sand to Three Hundred Thousand
Taken in New York. ; ' ? _
COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., Oct. 30.â
The biggest bona fide election bet of the
present campaign is about to be concluded
here. . W. " S. Stratton, the millionaire
mine-owner oi Cripple Creek, a, few days
ago offered to make a bet of $100,000 on
Bryan against : $300,000 on McKinley.
Stratton's offer to bet this large sum was
telegraphed East by the United Associ
ated Press, and through that medium was
given the widest circulation and publicity.
â¢ Mr. Stratton's offer has been the chief
topic of discussion since it was made, but
none of the local marine magnates or
capitalists evinced any disposition to cover
the money. The belief, however, was gen
eral that the bet would be called by out
siders. Teleerams were received here to
day that the bet has been taken and that
the money is in the Chemical { National
Bank of New YorK, placed there by well
known moneyed men of that city. On the
advice of his attorney:), Mr. Stratton de
clined to send his money to New York and
take chances under : the , New York : laws.
His ' money was placed \- in ; the . I First
National Bank of this city this., afternoon
and the New York money is expected to
morrow. Stratton has agreed that , if ,be
wins the wager he will place the winnings
to tbe credit of the Colorado Springs Free
Beading Library, a very small institution.

JULIUS MANNOW EXECUTED.
Pays the Death Penalty for the Murder
and Robbery of a Chicago
Cashier.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 30. â Julius Man
now was hanged at noon to-day. Both
the crimes for which he -was punished
and his trial were of a sensational char
acter. â  . â¢ . '
. On the night of June 25, 1395, Manncrw
and Joseph Windrath, both wearing
masks, entered the West Chicago strAetr
railway barns and demanded of the
cashier, Carey 8.. Birch, the money- in his
charge. Birch reached for a revolver,
when Windrath fired four shots and Man
now one, with fatal effect.
Seizing a bundlenof currency containing
$160 .the murderers escaped, but were later
arrested on information given by a woman
who lived in the same hou3e with them
and had overheard the men plotting.
The trial of Windrath and Mannow
was most exciting, several plots for their
liberation being revealed, and extraordi
nary precautions being taken to prevent
the success of these schemes. Mannow at
length pleaded guilty and made a full
confession, and on bis evidence both men
were convicted. Windrath was hanged
last June, but sentence on Mannow was
deferred. When later he was sentenced
he feigned insanity and secured a re
prieve, but his sanity being determined,
he was finally doomed to die to-day.
BOTH SIDES MAKE CLAIMS.
But It Seems That Old Missouri Is for
McKinley.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Oct. 30.â There was a
tendency to "claim everything" around
the State headquarters of both parties to
day. Secretary Griffin of the Republican
committee said : "We will carry Missouri
for McKinley. " A careful poll of the State
shows gains irr almost every county."
Charles Smith, private secretary to the
Republican National Committee, and R.
C. Kerens have completed a poll of the
State, and aver that Missouri will give
McKinley 50,000 majority.
These predictions and estimates were
shown to Secretary Love of the Demo
cratic committee: "Claiming Missouri
for McKinley by 58,000," said he, "is ridic
ulous. We stand by the poll as made
some days aeo. That showed Democratic
gains everywhere except in St. Louis and
Kansas City, and in tbe latter city we ex
pect to at least hold our own if we do not
make gains."

TROUBLOUS SEAS
ON DRAKES BAY
Battle- Ship Oregon Careens
Badly in a Ground
Swell.
Captain Howison Orders Anchors
Raised and Hurries to
Sea.
DANGER OF THE BIG VESSEL
Heels Over to Twenty-Nine Degrees
and Gives Those Aboard Cause
for Alarm.
Aboard the United States Battle-)
ship Obegon, Drakes Bay, >
October 30. )
This morning about 9 o'clock that finest
and most formidable battle-ship in the
world, the Oregon, had the roughest ex
perience of her trial cruise. When she
dropped Point Pinos Light, Monterey
Bay, and set her course to the northwest
last night the weather became more rigor
ous. A stiffer breeze from north-north
west began to careen over the waves and
kiss their tops into foam.
As predicted in the previous report of
her trial cruise from Monterey Bay, she
had another opportunity to test her sea
going qualities.
Before the sun's rim peeped over the
rounded summits of the Coast Range the
muzzles of the Oregon's 8-inch guns,
if they had been made fast athwartship,
would have plunged into the water or
sipped the foam. Before she finally
dropped anchor in. fifteen fathoms of
water under the hills aud lee shore of Sau
salito, the Oregon bad gone through such
an experience as she never had before.
Captain Howison was. on the bridge for
forty-eight hours since leaving Monterey,
and when the naval correspondent of The
Call left the ship last eveaing, the cap
tain, who is shortly to be promoted to a
commodore, was taking tea and his first
".square" meal' from the sideboard in hi?
own comfortable cabin in that length of
time.
The breeze from the north- northwest
was only a moderate one, as shown by the
log, but between the swells of the sea the
Oregon rolled over farther into the sea
than she ever did before. If a ship was
ever "rocked in the cradle of the deep,"
that ship was the Oregon last night on
tbe inboard of the Farallones and this
morning in Drakes Bay. The sea was not
extraordinarily heavy and the northwest
zephyr was not more than moderate.
The Oregon arrived off the heaas about
5 o'clock this morning, and beat about
waiting for daylight. When it came there
was a heavy swell on the bar and a land
fog, and the captain decided not to at
tempt to go in on that account. She bore
away for Drakes Bay, and about 9 o'clock
cast anchor pretty well in shore. The
Oregon had heeled over during the night
on her cruise up the coast to from 18 de
grees port to 21 starboard. The pendulum
dial of the ship shows only 30 degrees for
rolling, beyond which it is dangerous for
the Oregon to roil.
When the anchor was cast in Drakes
Bay the snip got into the trough of the
sea, which was not more than a healthy
ground swell. Tbe ship began to roll
more violently than ever. Sbe started at
about 10 degrees and in four or five rolls
she keeled over to 29 degrees. What Cap
tain Howison thought of this state of
affairs is shown by the fact that he ordered
the anchor heaved sgain. and turned
about for the open sea and Point Reyes as
quickly as he could.
Thesea wa9 coming over the decks fore
and aft. Whereas the bric-a-brac in the
staterooms had been picked up several
times during the night 'it was now turned
into a heap on the decks and bumped
violently against the bulkheads.
Those at breakfast were obliged to cling
to the chairs and tables. In the ward
country and in the junior officers' mess
tables and chairs skated, over the floors to
the imminent injury of every one who at
tempted to hold or stay them.
Lunch at noon was taken with tbe rocka
on the tables. The drawers of the state
rooms darted in and out of their fitting 3
during tbe mid and morning watches, and
between 9 and 10 o'clock two sailors were
thrown to the deck, and slid to the sides.
The men saved themselves by catching
the rails, after half their lengths was
hanging over the sea.
But in this connection reports from the
battle-ship Indiana and the cruisers Phila
delphia and -Baltimore show that they roll
as much as tbe Oregon, and they are still
riding the ground swells and giving the
green sea a chance. The Oregon must roll
heavier than sbe did last, night before
there is any danger of her going over on
her side, the officers said.
About 3 o'clock the battle-ship squared
away for the Golden Gate. She took tbe
north channel, under- the technical guid
ance of Executive Officer Drake, who has
surveyed the channel, and droppedanchor
at Sausalito at 4:25 in the afternoon. Her
fires were hauled, and the Oregon will re
main there indefinitely, indulging, in prac
tice drills, battalion drilis and torpedo at
tacks at night, before she is ready for the
official inspecting board.

"" -SANTA ROSA, CaiÂ», Oct. Sonoma
County's big day has come and gone,
."â¢ leaving in its wake thousands of happy
..' â anct enthusiastic Republicans and a few
â¢ awe-stricken Democrats and Populists.
Â° Tom Reed has-been here and has been
â  â¢ right *, royally welcomed. Everybody;
speaks of" the" statesman from . Maine as
â¢ Tim Heed, and the* niore enthusiastic of
/liis admirers r'ffectionately designate him
d j= plain. "Tom. ' This they consider they
T\;iiave a perfect right .to do, ' and do not
Â° of any disrespect by so doi:u:- :

. â inbrnhjg there was only one fear as to the
â outcome of to-day" 1 ? demonstration, and
â¢-.' /that was that 'it;, might rain. ; That tear
'::/; a3 soon dissipated "by the sun's warm

.-.; The country people began coming into
;. >. town at an ; early boor, and by 11 o'clock
â â¢' the. streets, were- jammed. At 11 : ' "> ' the
â  train from the south arrived with eight
.-. carloads of people, and twenty minutes
\- -after .this came, the train' from the "north

â¢' be mentioned, broke rank 3 and fairly
overran â the Â° restaurants and , hotels ;in
'Â°' something to eat. .Â° - '.' . ;'
Â°. At 2 p. jt. the o big procession was 'again
0 under way, .passing straight out Fourth
, â¢ ''" street to the G.ity Gardens. Â° What seemed
-Â-'< to please Mr. Reed more that* anything
else was the evident. delight of some GOO
o.- schoolcnild.ren, who had to.be granted a
- . .recess to see the parade pass the school
.^'."â â¢iouse...-'Most, of these wee tots, had
..â â¢ :, bouquets of yellow chrysanthemums, with
'.'â  ' which they â¢bombarded* the man from
â¢: Maine and it was hard to tell who enjoyed
.. it the mostâ -Mr, Reed or the children.
: â .'.â  The big pavilion in the City Gardens was
r"; crowded to its utmost capacity, long before
..- the speaker arrived. The. sides of the
: ;. building' bad been taken out, and thou
'â¢:'.-: sands of necks were craned from the oat
â  . : . side as their owners tried to see or hear.
:. After some .little difficulty guests were
.^escorted to the raised platform in the
'..'.'i center of -the pie" structure, and a shout
â¢ .â¢'that snook the- rafters went up. " In vain

' â â  that this meeting was a "frost," or that it
"was not the most noisy hearty greet
. Ing eTer accorded to a speaker in this city,
then and there' it will have uttered a cam
paign lie of "unusual size". # .
When order was at last restored Mr.
. Lemmon, in a short but spirited address,
said that Sonoma County, once the banner
Democratic 'county-, of the -State, was now
and for all time Republican. He then
â¢introduced Speaker Reed, and th, re was
more noise and plenty of Âi t. Mr. Reed
â¢ spoke for more than an hour in a semi
humorous vein, but at times he was quite
' "â â sarcastic* when speaking of the Chicago
.- .- platform" and its = followers. In substance
â¢ -he said : â 
-.* Ladies and gentlemen of California: I-asstrre
c .you I appreciate this cordial greeting. At the
outset ol.m>* remarks I would say that Ido
not ( xpect to stir you by any utterances ap
â¢-. pealing io your! passions or your . prejudices,
. biit ratner shall* I appeal to your reason and
â ' rj>"r judgment. ,My remarks must pass the
' crucical'test of your intelligence to be of any
' use in this campaign.
Â°. I cannot omit vine some things abbu* the
â¢Democratic party that may seem unkind. I
)iav^l)een'ln political life for many years and
have not always been able to say kind things
. oi them. ;â¢ [Laughter.] But 'i there are some
'Dsmocra^who are deserving of more credit
than they. will ever receive. I : speak of - those
of that party who are opposing the Chicago
' platform.': It is not %asy to rise i above our
rtarty. Men nnd the associations of years hard
A break awa >â¢ from, and it requires courage of
. â  â â¢ill order to act o o ut "sentiments. The
.tlWmen in the Democratic party are standing
ufAJor good, government. [Applause.] There
have been a meii in "that J party in the past
' â¢ and probattiy *vM be it! the tuture,' and I freely
accord them the credit that is due.
. . "The Republican* party was ' organized in
â  â¢1856, and I nave just met a man who was
. , present and helped to do it. " Inmemterit
â  well myself, for I then and: there enlisted in
its ranks. Look Dsck "to â¢183G, ttnd see if . you
see anything in the record of our party to be
ashamed of. : [Applause.] IJo not say it was
always the best* and wisest, but I do say it has
averaged the ben. There have been times:
when I was not just satisfied with all it did,
but on the y.-hole r declare 'that its record ay-"
eiages very well indeed. â â [Applause.]
In 1801 there was a crisis- .and the Republi
can party took its j Etand. It was assisted by
many good Democrats, and- I would like to;
a. k ii" there is any Democrat present who is_
not proud of what we did. . . " â )
In 1668 another question arose as-to bow. we.
should ray our-d'&bts/ Some "of "tne-.ouflstahd
ing bonds cost thelr-lioldcrs but 75 cents on
the dollar, but they "bought .them when they;
were worth but 75 cents. .. The/United States
â  mi ht have paid as the Confederate States .
paid, but- those who helped" our country in her
hour of need were paid for the risk taÂ«R-i.
Since those dark days we paid 000 ,000, 000
ot debts and kept the Nation's honor untar
nished. As Senator Hartley once said, "Every
bond is as sacred as a soldier's grave." -
' Is there any one present who is not proud o*
that record? One of our next battles was.
whether or not we (should issue unlimited
"greenbacks. They say greenbacks carried us
'through the war. "i believe we could lmve got
along witnout them. In any event fiat money
must be limited in quantity. Legislative
bodies are sure to be asked, to overissue this.
species of money. We were in a big hole and
! the question was how to get out. Surely not
by diggiij* the- hole deeper and having a
longer climb. [Laughter.]
â â ' The Republican party resumed specie pay-,
ment in 1879 ar-d has never been sorry" for it.
What followed? Why, fourteen years of the.
most magnificent prosperity ever enjoyed in j
â¢the/Almighty's -universe. The Nation j
righteous and honest. It pays to be righteous 1
f in a nation or en individual. .We have found
this out. ' We have paid the expense of right
eousness: -shall" w.o continue the rolicy?
[Many voices, -Yes! yes I"] Well, let us do it
thoroughly and With'.ajus!>. [Cheers.]
I hear but one line of' conversation all over
'the United ' States and.. that ;is that the busi :
i ness men of this country are rising, irrespect
i ive 6f party and lire determined to carry.the
i country .â¢arid'ther.wiH do it. [Applause.]
! -. The only .salvation of the country is plenty
lof cominori sense. But in 1802 the people
i faiiea to "have their usual â quota of. common
sense and put the Democratic i.arty in to power,
and; the Democratic party, then was better than- 1
it is to-dayâ so per cent better than that party-
: thjit;does not dare to have its own headquarter?,
'and'hus one. head and two appendages [laugh*
â tef]:.- or I might class them nil together, and
j say -three of a .kfhd.: But that party made a
! failure of running this Government. T.tis was
' not the fault of- individual Democrats, and 110
; T.'.'puU'ican to-day dreams ot saying anything
about .the .stealthy '"crime of 1892." 0 The
! Democratic party was a failure in power be r
caiise had no common bond of 'union. True,
'it was united on one thingâ it was against us-^
-sOme Democrats because of * the tariff,- and
.'some becurse many Republicans favored' pro
'hiblt.!bn. ; But while out of power, its-sole bond
of union was its opposition to us. # '.'. '.'â â  '
'. Some Republicans left us and went with the
Democrats in 1892. They could not get along
with- us, and of '^course could not : get along
with the Democrats. â¢ . V- : : . \ . .'. â 
'â .' Another misfortune to the Democratic party
was that Its power came from south of the
Mason ahd'Dixon line. I want yo.u to follow
me closely -on. this subject. - I do not wish to.
' say anything sectional,. but its ma'jo.rily came
i : from south of Mason and Dixon's line and the
men of the South have not the business, train
ing and education of those of the North. . They
do not do the business of the country in the.
South, I venture the assertion that not
r one in "ten Northern Democrats would have
proposed the Wilson, tariff bill if in control of
the party. . "-, - â  â¢ â¢ ' â¢ \
I want to offer an apology and an excuse far
the Democratic, party. â¢ It is my ancient foe
and I hate to see.it disappear entirely. But if
it has got to go I am glad to see it go as it is
going. Its best men axe cominc to us and
they may like us well enough to stay. But'
[ those who are left of that party seem to have a
I .great desire to have us discuss some other
I subject besides the one they once said the
I Nation's salvation depended upon. I believe
I that in the near future their sole request will
be to have the mountains and rocks fall upon
j them and complete their annihilation.
Here the speaker took up the silver
! question, and at the commencement of
â  bis discussion of the subject said : . 'â¢ -
I confess that I hate to botner with, this
si.ver question. . After several months' s^udy
I "it-seems to mo so trivial as to noi deserve the
1 attention it is getting. '
Nations are like Individuals; they often
imagine something ails -them, and it is often
i nothing" but imagination;'" They conjrffce up
I some terrible and then fix as the cause 1
something that.has nothing to do w-it.h it on
'earth.* They, 'tell you 1 about the "crime of
1873." â  Fox years I have sat in the House of
Representatives' a"nd- heard what 1 1 knew were
Democratic speeches by thess allusions to that
imaginary crime. Each and every one of them
In his speech alluded to the stealth andsecretfy
'of the alleged crime. I have read 100 columns
."of the debates upon the subject "in the: Cdn
gressiona.l Globe. The question was referred Â°
and rereferred to committees,- it was, you :
might say. done on the hous&tops; yet whe.n
these sneakers arose in their places out upon
- the' circumambient air there- would float those
\ doleful word?, "the stealthy and secre"t crime
!Of 1873?" i; .â¢ " . ( : . â - ; -;"l- â¢
â  I saw a good answer to the "crime of 1873
wail in the streets of â¢an.lllinois â¢ town. It was
a horsecar on the followed by a modern
trolley-car. ; They were labeled '-Before '73"
and "Alter ! 73." [Laughter and- applause.]' " .
â¢ But who committed this terrible crime?
â¢Two Senators from Nevada had largely to do
with it.- . o â¢' .'.'.â  i -V..- ' â¢..â¢
It. was entirely unnecessary for Mr.
Reed to tell the audience who they .were,
for' many whispers of Stewart and Jones
ran through the hall. He the.ll alluded to
the '-panics and hard ".times of.- the past,
both in; United States "history and in the
history of other, countries, and wanted' to
know if demonetization of silver caused
them. â¢ E& â¢â '.?"â 'â ' " â¢'â¢
. Let mo tell you what causes hard times. It
is human nature: Human nature requires its
ups and downs. It goes uphill. andVdown-dale,
and when in the .dale* should not.accept the
advice of every quack doctor and take Ml' the
j â¢quack medicine offered, it lias but to ascend
another .hill and â  prosperity is often insight.
We are. having hard times now. What causes
: them?' Suppose some Democratic ' party or
j other takes possession of the country and com
j mits the â¢'crime "of 1892?" . Business sto.ps and
the people begin to take an account of stock. i â¢
. Some long-headed j business man begins 'to
think the Hush times are a Lout over. If . he is
a banker he calls in his loans. Other men be
gin to see what is coming and stop buying.
Then : come hard times* and another panic.
They ha've'done this five times in the past and
â¢will most probably do it in the future.
Oh, but they stfy give us silver nt 16 to 1
j and we will hoxe_ prosperity; bat they give us
. no good' reason lor their assertion?;' They .say
we need more money; say we need more capi
tal. Money does not make business, but busi
ness makes money. We want labor and capi
tal to be married. [Applause".] Business , is
net dependent upon gold and silver, but upon
confidence. Confidence puts capital ' in mo
. tion. â¢ Without confidence no one -loans ana
no one can borrow. The ; man worth $100,000
;in real property can get no money to do busi
ness with; men will take no, stock in the

Industry.

Reopened if He Is Chosen
President.
OWORS FAVOR THE ORATOB.
Residents North of the Boundary
Greatly Interested in the
Cairp.ugn.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Oct. 30.â A Call
correspondent has just returned from a
trip through the Slocan country, where
the rich silver deposits of British Colum
bia are located, and finds that in that lo
cality great interest is being taken in this
Presidential campaign. There are hun
dreds of United States citizens resident in
Southern Kootfcnav and the Slocan wlio
I are owners, or largely interested in the de
velopment, of large sliver deposits, and
they are unanimously in favor of the
I election of Bryan and the adoption of a
I policy of free coinage of Silver. In actdi
| tiou to these citizens of the Un-ited States,
j the sentiment entertained by Canadians
whose interests are bound up in the en
hanced value of the white metal is in fu
| vor of such legislation in the country
south of the4sth parallel as will result in
a "boom" in silver properties.
The mine's now shipping are but a small
i proportion of those which will, when an
enhanced .price is obtainable for silver,
proceed to dump their products upon the
market. -Near S.mdon are a number of
claims which have been recently staked,
and. which, from surface indications- are
the richest .silver-nroducing claims in the
world. A body of ore several hundred
I feet in .width and which can be traced for
I upward of a mile back will be developed
l to its utmost capacity immediately on re
: ceipt of the assurance tfiat the' United
j States mints will be opened for the coin
j age of silver at a price even much below
r that spoken of by the -Bryan orators, and
j the output of those mines now shipping
! will be greatly increased. Viewed from
! the standpoint of those interested in Brit
ish Columbia silver properties, nothing
could benefit them moie than the election
I of men pledged to fice-silver coinage, and
I there is little wonder that those whose
j patriotism is subordinate to their love of
gain are anxious and willing to do in
their power to assist in the return ol"
Bryan and his supporters.
A* a contrast with the sfronjr Bryanite
Jeeling in the silver mining districts of
British Columbia, where a large number
of properties at present comparatively
worthless will obtain a value by the enact
ment of silver legislation in the United
States, the more patriotic sentiment en
tertained by those who are interested In
the steady'growth and natural envelop
ment of the mining industry of the
province was strikingly evidenced in the
South Kootenay district. Merchants and
capitalist* of Spokane, Seattle, Tacoma
and Portland, whose investments in the
gold mines of the Rosslnnd and Trail
Creek districts are more of a side issue,
| and whose interests in the businesses with
J which they are connected in their own
States are Their chief concern, stated when
interviewed that in view of the commer
cial disturbances which the return of the
Democratic candidate wriuld produce,
they would willingly sacrifice all their in-
I tcrests in foreign properties rather than
jeopardize their larger ami more import
| ant financial investments in thei<" native
j country.
Taken altogether, the question to be de
cided at the approaching Presidential
election is the most potent for good or evil
for the silver miners of British Columbia
of any which has arisen within the his
tory x>f the country.

I B. Martinclli, District Attorney of Marin
County. A brass band from S.au3alito was
present" and. enlivened the proceedings
with choice music. ,
' Mr". Martinelli spoke very emphatically
and plainly as to the necessity of support
ing the' Republican ticket, and in this
connection of supporting .the legislative
ticket also; besides the election of Mc-
Kinley it was necessary to have : : a Re
publican Congress to support him, in
order that the country may reap the
I benefits of "protection arid again return to
! prosperity and progress.
General Dickinson said the issues of the
present, campaign were reduced to two â
free silver ! and protection â he vigor
ously assailed the one .policy and sup
ported the other. _ In conclusion he said: J
I entreat you to cast aside any prejudices or

WHITE BEARD AT SAN DIEGO

SAN-DIEGO, Cal., Oct. 30.â Senator
Stephen M. White spoke at Fisher Opera
house to-night to a lurge audience. The
yello-.v badges of the -McKinley voters
were sprinkled so thickly through the hall
that the speaker found himself confront- !
ing a crowd more than half opposed to j
him.
Yet there was not a single hiss, disor
derly remark or interruption, and the
free-silver advocate got a respectful if not
a very enthusiastic hearing.
Senator White devoted his attention to
bolstering up the money planks of his
platform. "He claimed tnat the cry of
repudiation was not true, and in the next
oreaih said that if the United States
persisted in bringing about a bi
metallic standard England would bo
forced to do so also, in order to serve her
creditors as we served ours. He admitted
that the silver-mine owners would make
the first profit on silver, bat snid the cost
of mining would be so great that it would
be very little, and that after the silver had
been coined then the benefit would be felt
by all.
The audience was clearly against Senator
White, though Ii is easy flow of language
was enjoyed even by those who failed to
find his customary logic.

Hail Banner day !
Set Old Glory fly ins.
Welcome, Tom Reed.
Get into line for prosperity.
Don't miss the granl parade.
To-day San Francisco asserts herself.
Join the march for McKinley and Ho
bart.
Turn your enthusiasm loose and let it
bubble. '
It is a great day for politics and the
Nation.
Follow the banners and keep step with
the music.
The battle is over, and this is the day for
the shouting.
Patriotism, protection and prosperity is
the banner cry.
Watch the parade, ye Bryanites, and get
an object-lesson.
Victory knows to-day where she will
perch on Tuesday.
Bear in mind that San Francisco speaks
to-day for ail California.
There is no longer any doubt about Cal
ifornia. She is all right.
The procession to-day will mean busi
ness, and don't you forget it.
Loyal citizens never fail to find har
mony in the music of patriotism.
As you honor the liag to-day don't for
get to honor the men who fought for it.
The talk of coercion has stopped. Pub
lic indignation has been too much for it.
We favor neither cheap money, cheap
men nor cheap patriotism in this country.
Men who love the Union will vote for
the soldier candidate who fought to de
fend it. ; '
â¢ Note the decorations to-day and see how
, â  universal is the sentiment - for protection
. and sound money. 0 Â». I Â°

of coercion amounts to. Â» %
The Republican party will ever defend
American labor and its right to be paid in

The h6nor shown to" the ' National flag
is a manifestation of the determination of
the people to vote for country first,
country last and country with stainless
honor all the time. 'â¢'â¢; I
The efforts of the Popocrats to find co
ercion in this campaign closely resemble
those of the fellow who spent a dark night
with a dark lantern in a dark cellar up a
dark alley looking for a black cat that
wasn't there.
San Francisco's welcome to Reed will be
all the more earnest because of the popu
lar indignation at the attacks made upon
him by the Popocrats. Californians will
not permit their distinguished guests to be
insulted with impunity.
A parade similar to that in San Fran
cisco will be seen to-day in all the great
cities of the Union: There has never been
anything like such enthusiasm in our
politics since the war. The whole country
will be on the march for McKinley and
Hobart this afternoon.
All over the Union to-day the people
will be manifesting their loyalty to the
American flag anrt their devotion to great
principles of sonnd money and protection
represented by McKinley and Hobart, and
the consciousness of that fact will go far
toward increasing the enthusiasm of' the
marchers in the grand parade.
.The significance of the popular demon
stration will not be misunderstood/ It
means the people wish American goods to
be made in American mills by American
labor, they wi*h American money to re
main stable and honest, they wish Ameri
can law to be maintained inviolate, and
they intend to crush out free-traders,
money-tinkers and lawless agitators by an
overwhelming vote at the polls.
THOMAS BRACKETT REED.
Thomas Brackett Reed will be the guest I
of San Francisco to-day, and will be
greeted with every triDute of respect
which it is within the utmost affluence of"
our hospitality to bestow. Every Califor
n|pn who has a realizing sense of the pro
prieties of civilized life and of the courte
sies which are due to men of eminence
and of more than National reputation
will endeavor to make Mr. Reed's visit
among us a season ot unalloyed satisfac
tion ta him. The State of California is
honored by his presence, and is expected
to honor herself in the welcome which at
tends his coming and will surround his
stay. . â¢ '
The great parade of this afternoon and
the vast throng which will assemble at
the place appointed for his speech to
night will amply prove to Mr. Reed that
he occupies a definite and permanent
place in the affections of the people of
California. With loving remembrance of
tbe Maine statesman who is dead we turn
with open hearts to the Maine statesman
who is living and in whose ability to lead
and to guide the Republican party we
believe as firmly as we bad faith in the
geniu3 of Biaine.
The position which Thomas Brackett
Reed holds amon^ American statesmen of
to-day he has fairly and fully won.
Through thirty years of public service he
mounted steadily to his present eminence,
and, in the language of Biaine, 'His pro
motion was not more rapid than his
ability justified." During the past twenty
years, through victory and defeat, he
has been tbe leader in Congress of
the Republican party. The surpassing
quality of that leadership has been
measurable, not more by the loyalty
of bis friends than by the acrimony ot
his enemies. Throughout tbe storms and
sunshine of that eventful period he has
steadfastly maintained the highest repu
tation for integrity, for political sagacity,
for commanding ability and for unfalter
ing courage in dealing with the problems
of the time.
It was the possession of these quali
ties which procured his selection as
Speaker of the Fifty-first Congress. The
position of the Republican party with
reference to the issues of the day required
for Speaker of the House a man like Mr.
Reed, in order that the business of the
Nation might be done by the majority in
Congress without the delays and obstruc
tions which foolish precedents had long
permitted to prevail. He found the
House of Representatives so enmeshed
in a network of senseless rules that
its minority had more power to prevent
legislation than its majority to enact it.
With an amount cf courage and an appli
cation of common-sense which excited
world-wide reputation he brushed aside
precedent, swept away the meshes of mis
rule, relegated the obstructing minority
to its proper place, declared a quorum to
be present when in fact it was so, and set
the majority in Congress to work making
needed laws.
For so doing he was assailed by his baf
fled political opponents with the most ven
omous abuse which bas been heaped upon
a public man during the past twenty years.
With perfect confidence in the recti
tude of bis action and with the abso
lute courage of his convictions he faced
vis angry enemies, and compelled them to
obedience of his rules. The verdict of
history has completely vindicated tbe
wisdom of his action and the rightfulness
of his course. Mr. Reed presided with
entire success over tbe Fifty-first Con
gress, and vrhen the fortunes of politics
placed his political opponents in control
of the succeeding one he enjoyed the
triumph of seeing bis enemies obliged to
admit his wisdom by adopting and en
forcing his rules.
Thomas Brackett Reed is a New Eng
lander by birth, by inherited qualities and
by the possession of that massive rugged
ness of mind and body so characteristic of
that section of our country, which for the
past three centuries has been engaged in
growing "rocks and men." He thinks so
deeply and so clearly upon the issues of
the day and has such a Saxon simplicity
of expression that he is able to make the
most profound problem in economics and
politics appear as clear and plain as an ex
ample in addition. It is this rare capabil
ity which makes Mr. Reed ao attractive
add persuasive a speaker and which renders
him superior to that class of orators who
lay claim to a greater refinement and'
subtlety in rhetorical art.
He will speak to the people of San Fran
cisco to-night upon the issues of the cam
paign. He should be seen and heard by
every one who can possibly come within
sight of his person or sound of his voice.
Whatever the result of the election may
be in California, or in the country at large,
there is no. doubt that every Californian
who is privileged to see and hear ' Mr. Reed
will be proud to cherish the fortunate fact
in remembrance for the remainder of his
life.
It is the contraction of the confidence
of the country and not the contraction
of the currency of a country that causes
hard times. There is plenty of cur
rency In the country and (hat which is
lackingâ confidence â will not be re-
stored until hand in hand wi:h honesty
we march to the polls on November 3
and elect that man who is honesty
itself, the mention of wiioso name us
President will be enough to restore the
busineÃjg and confidence of the coun
try.âHon. J. J. Cowen, New York.
MALICIOUS LYING.
In an editorial purporting to give an ac
count ot Mr. Reed's tour in California tbe
Examiner of yesterday said: 4> He i s go
ing to finish his tour in Sacramento to
help Mr. Huntington's dishwasher, Grove
Johnson, to inflict a new disgrace on Cali
fornia and Congress."
Ever since Mr. Reed's tour of California
was announced, and more particularly
since he entered the State, tbe Examiner
has been engaged in the task of reviling
him in words more false to the truth than
have been its caricatures to his features.
The Examiner has endeavored both by in
sinuation and by direct assertion to make
out that Mr. Reed was brought to Califor
nia by Mr. Huntington. Its editorials
and its caricatures have with an equal
vileness ten led to assert this lie. '
It is impossible to correct or refute ali
the falsehoods that come forth during tbe
closing days of the campaign, but we will
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 31, 1596.
do our best to render this one -harmless.
Theprogramme arranged for Mr. Reed in
California was the work of the State Cen
tral Committee. It did not provide for a
speech by Mr. Reed in Sacramento. Thac
programme has not been chanced except
in the minor point that Mr. Reed will
speak in Oakland in the afternoon instead
of the evening of .Monday as was at first
proposed.
The story that he is to go to Sacramento
is false in every particular. Had it been
arranged for nira to go there it would have
been equally false in the Examiner to as
sert that his going .was arranged by Mr.
Huntington.
From this example of tbe course fol
lowed by the Examiner in the campaign
people can see how much reliance is to be
placed on any of its assertions. It has
raised a cry of coercion where there is no
coercion, it has maligned the workingmen
of California and insulted their employers.
It bas endeavored to defame a great states
man, it has affronted the dec ncy as well as
the hospitality oftlieStateand ithasshown
itself shameless, malicious and false in
every issue that has arisen. Tbe lies pub
lished about Mr. Reed will not affect him,
but it behooves the people of California to
rebuke them in tne most emphatic man
ner. Such journalism as this does not
materially affect politics, but it does re
flect discredit upon a community that tol
erntes it.
The free coinage of silver will drive
gold out of circulation, and the effect
will be to contract our circulation
9600,000,000. That means a panic in
business. It means a 'iepreciation in
prices of all kinds ; it means the clon
ing of our factories ; it mea m a black
I'rlday not only in Wall street, but in
every hamlet and villnge in the United
States.â Benjamin Harrison.
THE PARADE TO-DAY.
The parade to-day signifies the uprising
of the American people for a return
to prosperity and the maintenance of
law. It is a denunciation of Cleveland
and a condemnation of Bryan. It is a
rebuke to free trade and a protest against
free silver. It- is not by any means local.
Similar parades to that in San Francisco
will be held in every city in the Union,
and the vast majority of the American
people will either take part in them or
will give them approval by applause as
they march along the streets, decorated
with the National banner as emblems of
the National patriotism which animates
the movement.
In San Francisco the parade will be the
greatest political demonstration ever made
in tbis State. Labor and capital will
march together to express an equal deter
mination to redeem the country from vast
disasters and to save it from the possible
folly of Bryanism. In the face of the en
thusiasm which will be everywhere mani
fest, it will be foolish for the Bryanites to
raise their siily cry of coercion. There
will not be a man in the procession who
does not evince, by every means of ex
pressing human thought, that he is there
because he believes it is his patriotic duty
to make this a manifestation of his deter
mination to cast a vote for the Republican
ticket.
A few days ago it was calculated that
the parade would contain 30,000 people.
The growing enthusiasm on the subject all
through the week jzives reason for believ
ing that the first estimate will fall below
the number who will taka part in the
march. Very nearly every business and
every industry -in San Francisco wiil be
represented, and nearly all the counties of
California will hare delegations in the
line.
When we remember that parades of a
similar character will be held in every
groat city of the Union, we shall be en
abled to estimate to some extent the
nature of the great popular uprising which
bas resulted from the attempt to cover
free trade with the mask of free silver.
The people have seen that behind Bryan
stand Altgeld, Tillman, Coxej', Debs and
every reckless mischief-maker in the
country. They know he represents every
iawl-ss element that exists in American
society. They know that he stands for
the repudiation of honest debts, the degra
dation of American honor and the weak
ening of AmeFican law. They know that
he threatens more of what is dangerous
to the welfare of the Republic thau any
candidate that ever dared aspire to tbe
Piesidency. Knowing these things, they
will riot be content with the ordinary
course of defeating the candidate at the
polls, but will give public manifestation
of their abhorrence of him and his party
by popular demonstrations so emphatic
in their nature that none can mistake
them.
It is an outburst of loyalty, a display of
patriotism that the people will see on the
streets to-day. Every man who can pos
sibly do so should take part in the parade.
Every man should carry with him the
banner of the Nation. It is an occasion
which appeals to tbe best sentiment
which animates the American people, and
none who are true to these sentiments
should hesitate to give this public and
popular expression to them.
I preach this doctrine that here un
dor thitt good flag, the symbol of free
dom, under this arching sky, where
any young man may net his aspirations
as high as the stars, if he wishes; that
we should have a kindly feeling be
tween mep ; that every man should re
juice in every other man's prosperity;
that all are united and that we should
nil work together â not rend men asun
der, not embitter men with prejudice,
but put these sweet influences of pros
perity Into every home and the sweet
influence of charity and love Into every
heart.â BepJÃmln Harrison.
GROVE L. JOHNSON.
Hon. Grove L. Johnson, who is now the
chief victim of the slanders of the Demo
cratic press and ora.ors, is one of those
men whom all Californians delight to
honor. Tbe attacks made upon him are
but additional proofs that slander loves a
shining mark. In a certain sense it is a
compliment to him, that he bat been
chosen as the chief target of the abase of
California Bryanites, since it attests that
be is a champion of protection, sound
money and patriotism whom tbey fear.
, It is fortunate for Mr. Johnson in the
midst of this incessant abuse that he is
not unknown to the people of California.
His character and well-established reputa
tion afford bim ample security against the
slanders of bis foes. He is known to be
one of the foremost lawyers of tbe State,
an eloquent orator and an earnest advo
cate of the welfare of our industries. He
bas lived lone at tbe State capital, has
served his district in tbe Legislature witb
distinguished ability, and by bia services
there won the well-deserved honor of an
election to Congress.
In tbe great council of the Nation be
has shown zeal, fidelity and integrity.
He bas been an able champion of tbe in
dustries of the State and of tbe people of
bis Congressional district. Stockton is
indebted to him for the procurement of an
appropriation for a public Duiiding, and
the people of the mountain counties know
how much he has done to promote the
industry of the miner. In fact, every in
terest of California that has been at stake
in Congress has found in him a most earn
est advocate and champion.
Mr. Johnson well merited a renomina
tion from the Republicans in bis district,
and equally merits tbe re-election which
he is sure to receive from the people. His
constituents know him too well to be
affected by the slanders of his opponents.
One of the ablest orators in Congress, he
eives dignity and force to the California
delegation in that body, and all Califor
nians are gratified to know that he will
be returned this year by a majority which
will refute the calumnies of his assailants
and demonstrate the popular confidence
in his abilities and in his character.
"THE SUNDAY CALL."
The great political straggle, now hap
pily drawing to a close, naturally absorbs
much of the popular interest at this par
ticular time, yet the average man or
woman relishes diversion, and it is a gen
uine relief for them to have a chance of
turning aside for an hour on one day in
the week for the refreshing enjoyment of
a literary repa*t such as that afforded by
the columns of The Sunday Call.
Among the many attractions of to-mor
row's issue only a comparative few can be
enumerated here. A thrilling story of an
adventure with a wild beast will make ex
cellent reading for leisure time, while
those who prefer sompthing of a humorous
nature will be gratified in the perusal of a
piece of local fiction based on a very odd
contingency.
A new poetess of Northern California
sings her first song to tha glories of snow
crowned Shasta.
A charming letter from Cologne gives
some highly amusing traveling episodes
of an American family which Las sud
denly been raised from poverty to wealth
and the members of which have gone to
explore the art centers and pick up on the
fly such knowledge as may fit them to
shine in home society.
Then there is a story of a hunt for rare
game on icy wastes inside the Arctic
circie. It can be imagined that consider

Letters From the People.
A CALL TO LAWYERS.
The Duty of the Legal Profession in the
Present t riÂ«tÂ».
There appears in this morning's Examiner
an article by L. D. McKisick Esq., reproving
those members of the bar of San Francisco
Who assembled some days since for the pur
pose of participating in the -'sound-money"
parade to be held to-day, for their "asinine
stupidity," and their failure to "blush with
shame," and comparing them to the "three
tailors of Tooley street," who claimed to repre
sent the people of England. The marked
courtesy of the article is so apparent from the
copious epithets with which it abounds that It
would seem to require an equally respectful
reply.
That the constitution of the United States
provides that Congress shall not "make any
thing but gold and silver coin ana tender in
payment of debts" is quite true, but it is quite
Â» new discovery that the immortal document
required silver to be coined at a ratio of 16 to
1 with gold. It remained with certain so
called representatives oi the Democratic party
at Chicago to meke that discovery, and thereby
become the bunko-Bteereis of that great party
against the hu^est gambling scheme of the
age.
If the lawyer who opposes the policy of coin
ing silver at that ratio "ought to be stricken
from the roll," it is quite odd that the enor
mity of that offense was not recognized during
that long period of our financial history when
silver was coined at the ratio of 15% to 1.
Judge McKisick's ancestors or predecessors in
the legal proiession must have been pro
foundly impressed, as he apparently is, with
such a gross invasion of the organic law as the
unlimitird coinage of silver at that ratio when
16 to 1 was the only constitutional ratio for
"-ound money," and yet it seemed to escape
their zealous scrutiny. No one would object
at this day to the coinage of silver at its real
ratio of 31 to 1, except those who might thins
it unadvisable to have so bulky a coin, and
those who might think it unwise to have a
ratio which would have to be changed with
each fluctuation in value of that metal.
When the constitution of the United Btates
shall fix the ratio of coinage it will be time
enough to declaim about lawyers supporting
it. Until that is done those lawyers who be
lieve that the welfare and financial integrity
of the Nation is to be preferred' to the ambi
tious scheme of silver mine owners, will regard
it as treir highest duty to maintain one and
thwart the other.
The attempt of Judee McKisick to palliate
the gross and unwarrantable attack of the so
called Democratic convention at Chicago on
the highest court oi the Nation needs little
remark. The covert threat contained in its
platform to abolish that court and to recon
struct it' in the interest of those who differ
from its decisions so that that lofty tribunal
â¢'as it may hereaiter b' constituted" may be
made obedient to the behests of a portion of
the so-caled representatives of a political
partyâ ihe denunciation oi "arbitrary inter
ference by Federal authorities in local affairs
as a * * * crime against free institutions."
the characterizing of the Federal Judges as at
"on-ce legislators, judges and executioners"
seems to have escaped his attention.
When the lawfully constituted tribunals of
the Nation can with impunity be thus assailed,
when the profound respect that is due to those
in judicial authority is turned into contumely
and citizens of this great country are advised
to overturn and repuuiate the decrees of their
courts of justice, it is high time that the law
yers of this country vindicated with emphasis
their scorn and detestation of such counsels.
When they fail to do so; when they refuse to
respond to those sentiments of respect for the
administration of justice which their high
profession teaches them as the very funda
mental maxims of their lives it will be. a
melancholy day for organized society and
stable government.
.Who was it that said, "Now go some and pull
down the Savoy; others to the inns of court;
downwiih them ali; burn all the records of
the realm; my mouth shall be the Parliament
of England and henceforth- all things shall be
in common?" William M. Pisrson.
WOMAN SUFFRAGE,
President David Starr Jordan Supports
thn (<niie.
On the occasion of Mrs. Chapman-Catt's
lecture at Stanford University President
David Starr Jordan, in introducing her,
stated that he would take that opportunity of
placing himself on record in regard to woman
suffrage, wnich he did in the following words:
Sir Henry Mayne has said that the great
movement for freedom which is culminating
in our century is in its essence a movement
"from status to contract." In the old days
and with other races of men tne individual
man retained through life the status in which
he was born. He was born lord or slave,
sailor or farmer, clerk or shoemaker, and this
he remained through life. He was part of a
class and his fortunes rode or fell with the
fortunes of his caste.
The movement toward contract gives the in
dividual, in some degree, the making of his
own destiny. His class is determined not by
his birth but by his achievements or experi
ences. He may rise above the class of his
parents or he may as easily fall below it. if
we had perfect freedom the fate ot the indi
vidual wouid be exactly what the individual
would make It. To this end we have seen the
repeal, one by one, of forms. of class legisla
tion, whether intended to keep classes down
or to raise them up. All forms of legislative
paternalism or of coddling come,'in the long
run, to be oppressive to the individual.
The same* tendencies apply to the status of
women. The movement of social evolution
tends io uive each woman the place she can
individually fill. Laws once framed to pro
tect women serve to oppress them. The word
"male," which sets off a certain number of
duties and privileges as rights of men, nar
rows and limits the rights of women. The
ballot is only one of the sex distinctions em
phasized in law and custom. It is not the
most important one. But It. is important. The
duties and limitations of .-ex are great and
important. Ihey are defined well enough by
nature and need no emphasis from statute.
The word "male" in law or constitution is an
anachronism, and it is coming to be felt as an
impertinence.
Let the individual woman become what she
may become. Let her be strong if she may,
loving if she will, weak it she must She is
none the more loving or lovable or devoted,
none the better wife or wiser mother, because
from certain fields of cause or action she is ex
cluded by statute. The movement from status
to contract, the movement toward individual
freedom is not a movement of manhood alone.
It is a movement of humanity, and whatsoever
makes stronger, freer women will tend to
make stronger, freer men.

have strongly indorsed the amendment during
the past week: Sacramento County Ledger,

NICARAGUA CANAL
An important Issue to California Ig
nored by Popocrnts.
To the Editor of The Son Francisco Callâ Sir:'
The Republican platform declares that "The
Nicaragua canal should be built, owned and
operated by the United States.." The Popo
cratic platform is silent on the subject of this
great enterprise. Ought not this difference
alone, on a matter of t>uch vital iiapof iance to
California, be sufficient to determine how
every voter in this great State should cast
his ba:lot next Tuesday? The construction of
tup. Nicaragua canal is an issue in this cam
puien, and we must not permit it to be side
tracked.
Ca ifornia will never reach the full measure
of her prosperity until she enjoys direct com
munication with the markets of the Old
Wor.d.
The Gulf States are equally interested with
the Pacific Coast in the canal scheme, and the
merchants of San Francisco ought to unite
their efforts with those of New Orleans to com
bine the Congressional representation of the
two sections for the purpose of securing an ap
propriation to build this great work. But the
thing of first importance just now is to vote
for that party which has declared it-elf
friendly to the undertaking. C. r. Titcomb.
Los Angeles, Cal., October 29, 189b.
LET WOMEN HELP.
â itronc Reasons for Voting for the Sixth
Aiue-idiuent ti> the Constitution.
The differences in opinion which have agi
tated the minds of the people of tbesc United
States will soon have been decided one way or
the other. The National issues are great and
important, and the voters representing the
various political parties are necessarily more
occupied with them than with any state or
locai question.
Uut this election day in California will also
decide a question wnich, to the women of the
State, possesses more vital interest than even
that of gold or silver, free trade or protection.
It is the prayer for equal liberty to express an
opinion, for equal freedom to determine with
others who snail govern this country of ours,
that the women of California are sending
iorth, and which will be granted or denied, as
the sixth amendment wins or tails.
For years the women have thus prayed, and
now, for the first time, the question has come
beiore the voters of his atnte for decision.
If we could but make the men understand
and realize what this means to us; how earn
estly we believe it will be lor the best interests
oi the Slate that all its members should parti
cipate in its government; how humiliated we
feel in our condition oi disirauchisement and
hopeless 1 ck ot influence; how strongly we
believe that there is noble work for us to do,
and glorious results to accomplish in the fiVid
of politics were we but permitted ; ii we could
make the men see tins, we should not fear the
result. For we be.leve tnat thu majority of
men are good men, nud we know good men are
not pleused or sati.-fied with the present con
dition of polities, and if they could but be con
vinced that women in politics would help to
purify them, we are sure we should not ask in
vaiu to be allowed to do it.
In all institutions, of whatever nature,
where women are a part, they represent the
moral force, the unselfish enthusiasm, the en
ergetic work, that aro needed to benefit so
ciety and which are nowhere more strongly
needed than In the Institution of politics to
day, but which are bo well known to be lacking.
Good men say they have not Uie time to at
tend to political responsibilities, and if they
had thiugs are too hopelessly bad to be im
proved. Women would have time. They
would make time as they do for houseclenn
ing, and the same enthusiasm to clean up dirt
which, annually or oftener, assails the mind
of the good housekeeperâ and which every
man dreads because it maki-s things for a mo
ment so very uncomfortable â wouid be mani
fested in taking hoid of tne dirty corners in
politics and insisting upon their being washed
and scrubbed and the light of day turned ou
the"m.
This would undoubtedly be an uncomforta
ble time for those who preter living in Ihe
"filthy pool Ql i>oli;ics" just as it is, yet to the
clean-minded voter the honest, well-meaning
citizen, it would be a very delightful feeling to
know "the house is cleaned and garnished,"
and worthy to be lived in once more, and that
furthermore it wouid never get as dirty again.
Because women have heretofore lived in fhe
sphere of small and unimportant details they
will bring to beÂ«r on the' political situation a
searchlight of observation, a minute scrutiny,
which will see things that exist which men in
their inherited way of grasping larger fields
and wider affairs would never discern. This
closer looking at matters political could only
result in cood, for good women will never en
dure the "dirty corners." And who will say
this would not te a benefit to both men and
women ?
But beyond and above this characteristic of
women to busy themselves with the smaller 1
affairs of liie because they are not allowed to
do so with the larger interests of government;
back of this pettiness and restricted growth of
women exlstsa noble patriotism, which wouid
be one of the greatest benefits to the country ;
a patriotism which believes that the grand
race of statesmen is not vet entirely absorbed
in to "politicians" ; that it is possibl yet to find
love of country dominating love of office, ana
that those who believe in "the greatest -good
to the greatest number" are yet more numer
ous than those who would prostitute public
office for personal ends. This is not "practical
politics," perhaps; it may be too ideal for at
tainment, but the good women of tnis State
will have to suffer a long experience of dis
couragement and defeat before they will ever
believe such things cannot be. And is not
this ideal worth; an attempt to embody in the
real?
Is it not a motive worthy the support of
every good man, every man who is anxious
that this Government should be great and
noble, every man who Is a true and loyal citi
zen? Is not such a belief on the part of women
In the possibilities of politics, the outgrowth
of a patriotism that is needed, sadly needed,
in the Government to-day? It seems to us so.
and it is for an opportunity to prove that poli
tics can be made better; that the "filthy pool"
can be cleansed; that true patriotism and love
of country yet exists, that the women of Cali
fornia ask the men ot the State to vote for the
sixth amendment on Tuesday .next.

teacher to speak his mind.â New Bedford

Bryan is advising workingmen to wear Mc-
Kinley buttons and talk McKinley, but to vote
for him. In plain words he advises them to
practice duplicity and be as two-faced as the
mythical god. But then Bryan has been
preaching one thing and practicing another
so long that there is little wonder he sees
nothing wrong in othersdoiug the same thing.
âOmaha Bee.
The silver campaign has from the outset pos
sessed some strange and startling features. It
began with a nomination by frenzy. A Na
tional convention was swept off its feet by a
stump speech, and in that condition nomi
nated an inexperienced young' man. whose
most striking quality is a capacity for ugita
tlon. It has been forwarded largely by for
gery. Fictions, puro and simple, and garbled
speeches have been sown broadcast over the
land. The era of fury seem* now to have ar
rived, when speakers are at the mercy of mobs.
The most distinguished men of the opposition
are not accorded the reception to which they
are eminently entitled by every consideration
of fair play. Frenzy, Forgery, Fury!â Was
hington Star. -
THE FLAG IS FOR PATR IOTIC
VOTERS.
The Popocrats will never stop shrieking
about Chairman Hanna's flag circular. The
advocates of National and private dishonesty
seem to think that it is a terrible thing for the
leader of the sound-money forces to suggest
that the stars and stripes be displayed by the
friends ;of hone-t moneyâ by ever man who
has a patriotic desire to uphold the credit and
maintain the honor of the Nation. I
They were at first afraid the display of flags
would be so nearly unanimous as to -make
Bryan's campaign look like a farce, and that
is why they suggested that the Popocrats hang
2 \J ,k B ars an " :tri '' es also Then it was
asked that every It-publican attach to his ban
| ncr a plc:ure ot McKinley or the names oi the
â pubiicun candidate -", the R..pnbiiean flags
could be distinguished from the Popocra tic ban
ners. That aroused the anger of the Popocrats
still more. They objected to mating a politi
cal banner of thÂ« stars and stripes, and now
the P.am Dealer declares that it is against the
law to attach a picture it a name to tne Na
tional flan, which is all sense, the law s'm
,ply prohibiting the printing of a name across
the flag itself. ,
But why are the Popocrat3 so wrought up
over the flag incident, anyway? Are they
airaid to show their strength! Are they uu
wiLing to submit to a test wiich shall demon
strate how greatly in the minority the sup
porters of repudiation and dishonor really
are?
No matter what the motive which prompts
them to oppose a display of flags by Republi
cans, let the banners be flung out just the
same. â  The stirs and stripes should wave* over
every home in Cleveland in which dwells a pa
triotic voter between Saturday, the 31st lust.,
and November 3, the day of election.âCleve

How to Voteâ J. 11. R., City. The Instruc
tions on the ballot, "vote for live," or -'vote for
nine," or "vote for twelve," mean that the
elector shall not vote for more than that num
ber in the subdivision over which the instruc
tion appears. The elector is privileged to vote
for one or more Supervisors, not exceedii.g
twelve, or ii he does not wish to he need not
vote for any, and for that matter he could vote
for only one candidate on the whole ticket
and his ballot would be legnl, but a man who
would do that would certainly be a very in
different citizen.
. The Electoral Voteâ G. E. X., City. The
vote foi Presidential electors from a State are
counted the same as they are counted for any
other officer. It there are a half dozen sots of '
Presidential electors in tnis. State the nine
individuals receiving the highe.-t number of I
votes are declared elected, irrespective of the
party head. Witness the election of 1592 in
California.. Eight Democrats were elected and.
one Republican. ' ' In this election the votes for
electors will be counted for the individuals
and not for party. The votes enst for Demo
cratic electors and for Populist electors will be .
counted as a : whole to make up the popular
vote for Bryan, but not for electoral purposes.

Benitb, Cal. When 11 voter wants to show his
preference for Presidential electors must
place a cross opposite the nine names of his
choice. â¢ Voters do not cast their ballots for
parties, but they cast them for individuals. " A
voter can vote for as. many electors of one
party as he desires and make up the balance'
from the other electors, providing, in this
State, that he does not vote for more than nine
In tne aggregate. The Registrar of Voters in
San Francisco has sent to each voter a slip on
which is printed in bis letters: "The voter
must stamp the cross after each. Presidential
elector he desires to vote for." ' ' , <â¢.<=â ?,"
Electorsâ J. C. EL, Stockton, Cal. The peo
ple do not vote for President and Vice-Presi
deut, direct, because the constitution of the
United States provides that the President and
.Vice-President shaJi bo elected as follows:
.-' Each state shall appoint In such manner as the '
Legislature i hereof may direct a number of elec
tors equal to the whole* number of Sen tors and
Representatives to which .'the State may be on
titled in Congress; but no .Senator or Representa
tive or person holding an office of trust or profit
under the United states' shall be appointed an
elector. . . "
. Electors have been chosen In four different
â¢waysâ by joint ballot of the State Legislatures,
by a concurrent vote of the two branches of
the Legislature, by a general vote and by a
district vote. Â In 1872 the general ticket

ANOTHER FALSEHOOD
OF THE EXAMINER
How It Is Carrying On the
Campaign With Palp
able Lies.
Its Latest Slander on Thomas B.
Reed Disproved Beyond
a Doubt.
NOT TO GO TO SACRAMENTO.
It Was Not Intended at the Outset
Nor Since That He Should Sp.>ak
in That Place.
For several days past the Examiner, in
its desperate attempts to save the Demo
cratic party in California from annihila
tion, has been charging that Thomas B.
Rend was to be sent to Sacramento for the
purpose of delivering a speech in order to
assist the candidacy of Congressman
Grove L. Johnson for re-election.
As is usually and almost invariably the
case with all the statements of the Ex
aminer on political matters, there is not
the slightest foundation for this report.
Secretary Higgins of the Republican State
Central Committee eafd yesterday that
Mr. Reed's itinerary, as originally made
out and as it stands to-day, did not em
brace Sacramento at all. He said that
some merchants doing business in this
City and residing in Oakland had collect
ed a subscription from patriotic citizens
of that city for the purpose of defraying
all the expenses of Mr. Reed's visit to this
State and banded the proceeds to the Re
publican State Central Committee. They
asked in return for the subscription that
the committee should assign Mr. Reed to
speak in Oakland next Monday afternoon,
on which dale the Oaklanders "intended to
have a big parade, the speaking to take
p-lace in the pavilion at the racetrack.
The first arrangement made with Mr.
Reed was that he was to deliver five
speeches in this State, one in Los Angehs,
one in San Francisco, one in Stock'on,
one in San Jose and one in Santa Rosa.
By changing the programme so that he
would speak in Los Angeles in the after
noon and leave there 'or Stockton on the
same evening sufficient time would be
gained to allow him to speak in Oakland.
He will not sneak in Sacramento and it
was never intended that he should. Thus
another Examiner falsehood has been ex
posed. It was made out of whole cloth
and it was never pretended that there was
any foundation for it.
Arrival of Thomas B. Reed.
Thomas B. Reed and his daughter Kittie
arrived from San Jose at 10:40 this fnorn
ing, and were met at the Third and Town
send depot by Major McLaushlin, D. M.
Hignins and John 1). Spreckels, repre
senting the State Central Committee.
They were taken in carriages to the Tib
uron ferry and iest on the boat for Tiburon
at 11 o'clock on their way to Santa Rosa.
Ue was Hccompanied across the bay by
W. W. Montague, A. W. Foster, B. P.

Tiburon wharf the visitors were met by
A. B. Leromon and A. W. Byington, who

USED STAMPS ILLEGALLY
How Postmaster Giacken of Oak
Grove Squared Accounts
With Creditors.
A Poll of the United States Grand Jury
Sfcows McKinley an Overwhelm
ing Favorite.
John P. Glacfcen, one of the most prom
inent citizens of Oak Grove, Cal., was yes
terday indicted by the United States
Grand Jury on a charge of falsely using
stamps. The accused man is assistant
postmaster at Oak Grove and from the
evidence Dresented it appears that he used
his position to perpetrate a gross fraud.
The Grand Jury returning the indictment
was also discharged yesterday, the terra
for whrcn* they were summoned havina
expired.
Glacken's method of getting ahead of
the Government was not by any means
new. In fourth-class offices the amount
of the remuneration depends altQgelher
on the sale of stamrs. Some time apo
Giacken bethought himself of a way to in
crease the profits of the oflice and inci
dentally pay off a few debts. He ordered
larg? quantities of stamps from the de
partment and then began to settle with
pressing creditors.
- The Assistant Postmaster had pur
chased a house on the installment plan,
and regularly each month paid the assess
ment in stamps. Finally these trans
acting reached Inspector in charge
Munro, who (Jfitailed Inspector Thrall to
investigate the case. Without delay he
visited Oak Gi&ve, and there found the
condition of Uffairs even worse than re
ported. Gl:;cken had used about $500
worth of stamp* in payment of his debt-.
The Building and Loan Association was
his greatest graft, because their business
called for a large monthly outlay for
stamps. They had not Hesitated to ac
cept the little red gummed pieces of
paper, because they were just a? good as
ca*b to them. Giacken, however, paid
other debts with s amps, until finally the
market of Oak Grove became gutted.
Then there was talk, which finally ended
in Glacken's indictment, as already told.
The Grand Jury, .which has just ad
journed, held twenty-four meetings and
considered thirty-one cases. In twenty
two pases indictments were returned, and
in nine others the charges were ignored.
Just beore leaving the jury-room to file
their final report with Judge Morrow Â«

WORK CUT OUT
FOR THE MINERS
New Business to Come
Before Their Con
vention.
Laws Needed as to Locations
and the Rights of Co-
Owners.
A SECRETARYSHIP OF MINES.
A Suggestion That the Industry. Be
Represented in the Board of
Regents.
The State miners' convention) which
will meet in this City on the 10th of No
vember, will have brought to its attention
more questions of importance to the ruin
ing industry- at large than any of its
predecessors. -Â»â Â«
Aside from the unfinished work in con
nection with the mineral land act now
before Coneress and the reopening of
hydraulic mines, which is in tlie nature of
unfinisued business, there will be brought
to the convention's attention the question
of the establishment of a secretaryship of
mines in. the Federal Government, the
appointment by the' Governor of a mining
man in tLe Soard of Regents of the State
University, matters in connection with
the Mining Bureau and (.he adoption by
the Legislature ana ( ongress of suitable
general laws in regard to mining.
In this last connection the Mining and
Scientific Pre*B has had prepare i for the
consideration of the convention by A. H.
Ricketts of this City a number of proposed
laws and a constitutional amendment,
Of these one hat will be of most interest
to miners of ail classes is a law to supple
ment the FederÂ«l mining law as to- loca
tions, manner of recording and the rights
of co-owners.
The Federal mining law contemplates
that the miners ol each mining district
and the different States and Territories
may supplement the statute by regula
tions or laws governing the location,
manner of recording amount of work ned
essary to hold possession of a mining
claim, subject to requirements which need
not be here expressed. Ail the mining
States, except California and Nevada, and
all the mining Territories have long since
seen the necessity of adopting a general
code of laws relating to the above subjects,
annual assessment work and the rights of
co-owners. This necessity became appar
ent from the facts that the laws and cus
toms of one mining district had no force
or effect in any other mining district, that
th* regulations and customs were always
to be proven, and that they became inop
erative by disuse. This led to intermin
able confusion, which was obviat-d by
general laws.
The want of such a Jaw in this State
has led to conflicting decisions and civen
an instability to the locator's right to his
claim. It has miSled the locator into the
ruinous belief that the recording of his
notice in every event was an evidence of
his title; yet the Supreme Court of tnis
State has held that, in the absence of a
local rule or custom providing, for the
record, ii is useless for any purpose.
The marking of a location, next to the
discovery of mineral thereon, is the most
essential requisite of location; yet there it
nothing in the Federal law or the law of
this State which provides for the size,
character, position or marking of such
monuments. In one mining district,
therefore, 10 this State the marking of a
mining ciaim may be accomplished by
marking tbe center line with a stake or
monument and notice thereon, and per
haps in the adjoining district a locator
may be compelled to erect as many as
nine monuments upon his claim.
The Federal mining law provides for the
advertising out of a delinquent co-owner,
but the State law has not, until recently,
provided that the record of such proceed
ings was evidence of any fact therein con
tained, nor does it now provide that evi
dence may be had to show that the pro
ceedings had been annulled by due pay
ment of the 6 delinquent's proportionate
share.
The Federal mining law provides for
mill&ites and tunnel rights, but the would
be locator of such claims is at sea as to
what constitutes a proper marking of his
locaiion. The Lund Department of the
United States has endeavored by regula
tion to give the tunnel-right locator at
least a proper mode of monumenting his
claim.
The law which had been prepared by
the press on these subjects is designed to
add stability to the miner's title and fur
nish him a safe guide for the acqufring of
tbe different classes of mining ciaim*, as
well as overcome many of the conflicting
decisions in the courts upon these sub
jects.
Id addition to this is presented an
amended mechanics' lien law. The me
chanics' lien law of this State gives very
little protection to the working miner.
In fÂ«ct the Supreme Court has reduced
the lien law to an absurdity, as far as the
miner is concerned, in the case of Jurpen
son vs. Diller, and in the opinion which
declared that no lien existed where prop
erty worked was upon gjround held under
an agricultural patent or a Mexican grant.
Another law proposed is an amend
ment to the existing Federal law in
more clearly defining what shall consti
tute placers. A late decision of the
General Land Office narrows the rights of
placer locators and jeopardizes the rights
of main 1 who have located lands contain
ing gypsum, limestone, borax, carbonate
and nitrate of soda, sulphur, alum,
marble, fire-clay, kaolin, diamond-pro
ducing lands, mica, iron where not found
in rock in pJace, petroleum and other
valuable deposits of similar nature.
MRS. FAIRFIELD DIVORCED.
Will She Now Wfd the Hero of Her
Bicycling Romance?
The next time Annie Fairfield and
Thomas J. Mitchell visit the City Hall it
will probably be to procure a marriage
license. A week ago Mitchell was present
in Judge Daingerfield's court to fight for
the fair fame Of Mrs. Fairfield, who was
named as co-respondent in a divorce suit
filed by. Mrs. Mitchell. Yesterday Mrs.
Fairfield appeared as plaintiff in a simi
lar suit brought against her husband.
Mitchell did not oppose hfs wife's
efforts to free herself, nor did Fairfield
object to his spouse securing a divorce;
in fact, both seemed anxious that the de
crees should be made.
The original cause of the whole muddle
seems to have been Fairfield's lack of con
sideration for his wi:e. Two years ago,
fÂ»he testified, they disagreed and have sihee
lived apart, although under the iÂ» me roof.
Deprived of her husband's cpmpany Mrs.
Fairfield took up bicycling, and during
ncr excursions in the park me. t Mitchell,
who is also a devotee of the silent steed.
Tlieir acquaintance developed into regard,
aud finally Mitchell, who looks consider
ably younger than his charmer, negleqted
his family for her. Mrs. Mitchell besran
suit lor divorce, which action Mitchell
helped along lather than opposed. On
Mitcnell gaining his freedom Mrs. Fair
field at once sought hers. What the
result will be remains to be seen.
WHITEMAN IS RELEASED.
The Alleged Forger Allowed to
Go on His Own Recog
nizance.
The Charge Against Him Will Prob-
abiy Be Dismissed on Friday
Next
AlonzO J. Whiteman, who some time
ago was sentenced to ten years In State
prison for forgery in connection with the
Maxwell . swindle, and subsequently
granted a new trial by the Supreme Court,
was yesterday released on his own recog
nizance by Judge Wallace..
Whiteman is the son of a wealthy Min
nesota lumber merchant and was once
Mayor of Duluth. He, however, squan
dered his fortune, and, becoming impoy
erished, here In San Francisco, is alleged
to have forged the name ot a man named
Dixon to a check for several hundred dol
lars, whi,cb check he subsequently induced
the insurance man to cash.
The ex-Mayor was finally arrested on
four charges of forgery, on one of which
he was convicted. The Supreme Court,
however, decided that he was entitled to
a new trial, on the ground that it had not
been proven that any such -man as he
whose name was signed to the etieck ex
isted, and, further, that if he does exist,
it was not proven that his name was
Bigned by Whiteman without his permis
sion.
As Dixon is supposed to be in Chicago
and cannot be induced to come here to
testify, the prosecution feels that its case
is almost a hopeless one.
Wniieman yesterday addressed the
court in his own behalf. He claimed that
he is the victim of police persecution, and
that this new trial has' been purposely de
layed'by the authorities.
"Although seven weeks has elapsed
since the granting of the new trial," said
he, "no move has been made to set it. I
have here a letter from Carroll Cook, in
which he says that he will ask the court,
having been one of the attorneys for the
prosecution, to dismiss the tnree untried
charges and allow me to be released on
$500 bail on the other. I ask that your
Honor do this and that you grant me an
early trial."
Judge Wallace then allowed Whiteman
to go on his own recognizance and post
poned further hearing of the matter until
Friday next.

Conference of Commissioners,

MEASURES OF VIGILANCE.
Members of the Jury Will Perform
Active Service in the Field
Next Tuesday.
The Grand Jury, of which Frederick
Hobbs is forenvan, is not blowing a big
trumpet,' but one branch of its investiga
tion ha.s rather surprised the -Election
Commissioners. Perhaps the jury was
secretly advised that some of the election
officers recently appointed were not re
sponsible and worthy, but whether so
advised of not a committee of the jury,
assisted by the police, made inquiry con
cerning many of the 2'jOO officers constitut
ing the various precinct boards.
The investigation was quietly conducted.
For example, if the list of the appointed
officers gave the residence of John Blank,
inspector, at a certain place designated by*
street, and number the policeman went
there and reported il the person could be
found. The facts were then reported to
the Grand Jury. In one case it was found
that a man who had been appointed was
dead. In several other cases it was ascer
tained that the election officers did not
live at the respective places of residence
giv6n. In two or three instances it was
discovered that the men selected to judge
and inspect the election were men ol shady
reputation.
Yestemay the Grand Jury and the As
sistant District Attorney, Mr. Feixotto,
examined the election laws and discussed
the subject. Finally a committee of six
jurors went out to summon the Election
Oommissiners. Surveyor Tilton, Auditor
Brodenck and City and County Attorney
Creswell were found in the hall and imme
diately responded to the summons. The
Mayor and Tax Collector were not found.
Chief of Police Crowley was also invited
to attend the conference and accepted the
invitation.
The interchange of views in the jury
room brought out the fact that the Com
missioners found it exceedingly difficult to
obtain the services of capable citizens to
perform election duties on the precinct
boards. In some casts the Commissioners
had been obliged to appoint men who did
not reside in the precincts to which they
had been assigned.
The Grand Jury decided to act them
selves as general inspectors of election
next Tuesday. With their badires of
authority as members of the Grand Jury
they will visit the voting places ana ob
serve the manner of receiving and count
ing the ballots. ' If anything crooked or
suspicious comes under their observation
they will take steps according to their
powers.
â¢ Registrar Hinton was seen aft*r the ad
journment of the Grand Jury. It was his
judgment that the election officers this
year were above the average in point of
worth and intelligence. He knew that in
some precincts it was impossible to get
residents to serve. He acknowledged that
some. of the good men, selected to serve
had declined to perform .the duty and
tnerelore it would be necessary to fill quite
a number of vacancies.
P. A. Dolan and his attorney, Mr. Col
lins, went beiore tha Grand Jury and ex
plaine.l certain things connected with the
petition which Dolan circulated on behalf
of the "silverand protection ticket."
John F. Sheenan presented to the Dis
trict Attorney a request that the persons
who signed the election circular attacking
Judge Hebi>ard|shouid be indicted forlibel
in another case. In that circular General
Sheehan was mentioned as an "irresponsi
ble man and a political parasite." He
doubted whether the indictment for libel
on Hebbard included his own case. The
District Attorney held that the indict
ment already found embraced everything
in the circular.
Town. Talk.
This week's Town Talk is particularly no
ticeable for the way in which it handles po
litical issues editorially, while "Political
Chat" bristles with humorous personalities
and ''Editorial Aftermath" contains a pithy
review of important subjects just now agi
tating the public miDd. As in all previous iÂ»
sues the various departments devoted to mu
sic, society, the drama Hud other matters of
generul interest arc up to a Jiigh literary

concerning well-known people about town.

Some Were Very Nearly
Dismantled.
NUMBEB OF NARROW ESCAPES
The Brick-Handlers Will Hold Their
Annual Meeting and Ball
To-Nigh t
Collisions and disasters seem to bÂ» the
order of the day just now. Steamer after
steamer has gone ashore on the coast of
California, and the bones of many of them
are vow bleaching on the beach in Santa
Barbara Channel or near to the entrance
to Coos Bay. The Glenmorag is resting
easily on the rocks near Astoria, and the
Umatilla is now being got ready for a trip
to San Francisco for repairs.
Yesterday the Henry B. Hyde got in
after a long passage from New York. She
experienced unusually heavy weather last
Monday and in consequence lost her main
topgallant mast. The captain's report is
as follows:
Had fine weather till October 27 and 28, in
latitude 26.34 north, longitude 130 west. A
strong brec-ze of wind and heavy sea came up
and earned away main topgallant masr, main
topgallant yard, main royal yard, main sky
sail yard, lore skysail yard, mizzen skysail
yard, main topgallant sail, main royal, main
skysail, fore skysail and mizzen skysail.
The damage was not sufficient to stay
the ship, so the captain kept on his course
and finally picked up a pilot. All's well
that ends well, and the Hyde reached port
with the loss of the main topgallant mast.
The schooner Guide returned to port
ypsterday.' She left here on the 22d inst.
for Port Gamble, but was caught in the
southeaster, and lost her foremast, fore
rigging, foresail and jibboom. Captain
Olaen decided that it was better to return
to San Francisco, and did so. The Hyde
and the Guide game in together yesterday,
and the schooner with her foremast gone
and the Bhip with her main topgallant
niii-t gone miuie a significant picture.
The ship accepted a tow, but the master
of tne schooner made the best of the cir
cumstances and ricged temporary fore
sails, and thus managed to reach port.
The Guide will at once be docked for
repairs and another vessel will be sent to
Puget Sound to bring down the load' of
lumber awaiting the three-masted
schooner.
The Brick-handlers' Union will hold its
tenth anniversary ball in California Hall,
620 Bush street, to-nbht. The affair is
sure to be a success as William J. Dean,
G. F. Hanckoup and Peter Andersen have
the affair in hand. All tne brick-handlers
employed on the water front are in the
swim and consequently a large attendance
is assured.
Captain Pendleton of the Henry B. Hyde
had his arm uroken during the trip from
New York to San Francisco. He was not
otherwise injured and finally reached San
Francisco as a convalescent.
Captain Morrison of the R. P. Rithet,
now in Sydney harbor, and whom The
Call reported "as seriously ill, has since
died. Since then a new man has been put
on the >hip and from Honolulu she will
come here under an American master.
J. Silvera, who drives a milk wagon, ran
over Frank Glocker at the corner of East
and Sacramento . streets yesterday.
Glocker recovered, but Silvera was ar
rested and rharged at the Harbor Police
station with furious driving.
The steamer Narwhal arrived in this
port from tne Arctic last evening and
brings the following report:
"Left the ice October 11. Ha,d strong
northeast gales and found heavy ice in
the straits as far south as Big Island.
Hauled up at Indian Point in a strong
gale, and saw the Orca, Navarch, Alexan
der. We then experienced thick weather
and fresh northerly pales all the passage
for 1600 miles. The catch of the whalers
during the season is as follows: Whaling

SPORTSMAN'S REALM
What Is Being Done on Field and Stream by
Trap and Range.
Doubtless a large and enthusiastic gath
ering of the patrons of college football
will be present this afternoon to witness
the second game of the season -between
the Stanford and Olympic teams. At the
grounds, Sixteenth and Folsom streets,
the Young Men's Christian Association
team will meet a local team in an inter
collegiate football contest.
The opening of the new coursing park
at Ocean View to-morrow will, doubtless,
be welcomed by many lovers of the leash.
The angling season closed yesterday and
during the winter months it will be un
lawful to catch trout in streams above
tidewater.
The Sportsmen's Protective Association
will make a vigorous fight against the Salt
Marsh Preserve clubs at the next meeting
of the Legislature.
The principal event in wheeling circles
is the Olympic Wheelmen's Century run
around the bay on Sunday. 0
The pugilists are in active training for
the boxing contest, which will be held
next month in this City.
__ _â¦ Â«
AMONG THE WHEELMEN.
Molls, Ziegler ana Aylwara l.cturn
From the Eastern Circuit.
There are no road-races or country runs
Fcheduled for to-morrow by any of the
prominent bicycle club.-, probably for the
reason that the close proximity of elec
tion day demands mat the wheelmen shall
stay in towu and work for thsir various
candidates. There are a number of these
events in prospect for November, however,
if fair weather prevail.
The Imperial Cycling Ciub held a very
enjoyable party at Odd Fellows' Hall last
evening. It was the club's third hop, and
though it seems considerable to say. 'was
given on a higher scale even than its
predecessors. The defacing vas kept up
until a late hour and the members and
their friends thoroughly enjoyed them
selves.
The next National assembly of the
League of American Wheelmen will be
]ield at Albany. N. V., and will not corr.e
to San Francisoo, as was hoped. R. M.
Welch will probably be the delegate from
California for this division. And, by the
way, a very unfair criticism of Mr. Welch
jecentlv appeared in Cycling West, penned
l>y its San Jose correspondent, criticizing
league affairs on this coast In general and
Mr. Welch's conduct In particular. The
writer complains because San Jose was
ji'iven no rei>reseniation on the board of
officers. As a matter cf fact, there are
probably not more than fifty league mem
bers in the Garden City to-day, for the
reason that the bisr club there refused to
renew for 189C-S7. They care very -little
for the league down there and must not
be surprised at reciprocal action on the
part of the officials here. However, no
one should criticize Mr. Welch- for this.
He is known everywhere as a perfectly
fair and impartial gentleman, who has
conducted his affairs as a member of the
National racing board with wonderful tact
and discretion and has earned the good
v ill cf all the riders and those who follow
tb<* sport.
Reading the prospectus of the recently
organized Wanderers' Cyc!e .Club iormed
in ttie Mission, in which the charter mem
bers state their intent to be to thoroughly
enjoy cycling, never scorching or climbing
hilis, or ndiug too far, reminds me of a
similar association known as the Go-easy
Club, whose emblem is a shade tree, and
which has been a success from, iis incep
tion iialf a year :igo. Four ladies and four
K'enttemen comprise the total member
ship, which is limited to that number.
There are offices to be filled, and each
member holds one. Country runs are
taken with unfailing regularity every Sun
ifay, and their riding abilities may be
â¢judsed from the fact that they once rode
to Centervilift, :\venty-one miles, in an
hour arid a half, and after lunch rode on
to San Jose, forty-two miles for the day,
in time for the early train home. And
yet it is the Go-easy Club. During tbe
week the members meet at each other's
houses and card and theater parties are in
order. It is probably the most successful
club of its kind I know of (I happen to be
a member myself), and if the Wanderers
follow on the same lines they will h.-ue
found the true enjoyment to be had in
cycling.
"Biliy" Young, the well-known trainer,
who has just left the National racing cir
cuit, says, regarding the crack riders, that
Bald is the best all-around man, day in
and day otit; he is sure of a place in anj'
race. Cooper is in the best condition gen
erally, and he trains harder than any
rider on the circuit; condition wins for
Cooper. Gardiner is the SDeediest man
of the lot, but he does not use his head.
Ziegler is a strong and plucky rider, and
can be depended upon to be in the front
ranks at the tape. Tom Butler is a won
der, but he is not a stayer. If he is pre
pared for a special race he will beat them
all; then the next day they will all beat
him. Sanger's trouble is that he can't
jump. He is the best of the lot on a long
sprint.
The actual vote cast in the recent elec
tion of the North California Division,
League of American Wheelmen, was as
tollows: â . â¢
For chief consul, Frank H. Kerrigan, San
Francisco, 741; vice-consul, Henry F. Wynne,

The new league road books are now in
the hands of the secretary-treasurer, ready
for distribution. They are to be sent free
to all members who have never had a road
book of the division and for 50 cents to
those who have the 1893 edition.
CaDtain Lewis will lead the members of
the San Francisco Road Club on a blind
run to-morrow.
The annual election of the California
Cycling Club will be held Monday even
if.sr, tne names of the nominees for the va
rious offices having already been given in
The Call.
Entries for the nmateur road races to be
held at San Rafael a week from to-mor
row will close next Wednesday evening.
Entry blanks can be had from Frank Al.
Byrne, SHJU' Jonos street.
The Oiympic Club Wheelmen's annual
century run takes place to-morrow around
tbe bay. The division whicii expects to
make the ride in seven hours will leave
Ninth and Market streets at G a. m. and
tue slower riders will start an hour later.
C. S. Wells and Otto Ziegler Jr., the
California professionals, who have been
on the Eastern circuit, and It. P. Ayl
ward, Ziegler's trainer, are back in this
State again, having stopped off at Wells'
liome near Plcasanion. They will come
to this City to-day. Both Wells and
ZieglÂ«r nre in good, fora and will rideot
the oponitic: of the new Velodrome track
on November 21. Tne track is now-ready
for training purposes, the admission is
iree, and doubtless a great many riders
and spectators will assemble there to
morrow. The track is at Baker and Fell
streets. Spaldisg.
DUCK AND QUAIL.
Northern Birds Are Arriving In
Great Numbers.
The late storm has materially increased
the sport of the duck shooters. According
t a letter Avbicit was received yesterday
from Sonoma a large flock of birds have
arrived from the north, and the sports
men who will be in the marshes at an â 
early hour to-morrow morning should
meet with good luck. Provided the
weather is not too fine, shooting should I
remain good until ' about 10 . A. M., after |
which hour the birds generally, have left |
the marshes for the bay. In case of stormy |
weather the shooting of ducks should con
tinue all day lone. "
Reports from Suisun are very satisfac
tory, as during" the past week a marked
increase in the numbers of wild ducks I
on the marshes has been noticed. The j
snort on every marsh within reach
of the bay should be good from now until
after the heavy rains, when the birds will
depart for the southern country where
they will be accorded better protection. '
The : market hunters continue .to ship
large quantities oi game to the San Fran-'
cisco market?, but, strange to say, very
few arrests have been made. Last Satur
day; a prominent Clay-street game
butcher, had 3f>!) mallard ducks, which he
received from the southern country in bad
condition, dumped into the < bay. The
Game Warden has made a few arrests, but
there is no reason why he should stop i
suddenly in the performance of his duty,
as he cannot, possibly visit a restaurant or
commission, house without seeing quail
and duck exposed for sale. Of course, the i
Fish and Game Commissioners "are ex- !
cusable," as they contend that it la utterly, j
impossible for them to patrol the entire
State. Consequently it can hardly be ex
pected of them to make arrests in this I
City, where game is being sold ad libitum
under ttieir very eyes. , . . â *
Some of the Police Judges who are now
candidates for re-election have invariably
"acquitted â¢ market- dealers who were
charged with sell fug game out of season.
No doubt the sportsmen of this City who
are interested in the protection of game
and fish "and in favor of punishing the
transgressors of the game laws will re
member on Tuesday next, when"votin<r for i
good men and protection, those Police i
Judges : who favored in their judgments |
the sale of game and fish at all seasons of
the year. o ' .
, At the mass-meeting of the Sportsmen's i
Protective Association held on Thnrsdav ,
evening in Albion Hall the presiding offi- i
cer scored a keeper of the Teal Club who j
shot . deliberately at hunters who were '
shooting ducks in the Snisua. marshes. j
lie said that if the preserve cl ubÂ° people !
intended to win their "battles c m this way
the time was near at hand when, an ex
change of compliments would be neces
sary. He hoped, however, that none of !
the m*embers.wbo were nresent would re- â¢
sort to the use of the rifle unless it was :
strictly a case where their lives were in
danger. o Â° Â° . Â°
â¢ The case of Teuxberry Jones, whicli has
been pending since last year, will be heard
on November : (i in the Superior Court of
Contra Costa County. c â¢" 0 . 'â '
c No doubt- ttiat a large number of duck- i
shooters will avail of the opportunity of j
an early shoot on the Sonoma mdrshes to- !
morrow by taking passage on the ll;30 j
p. m. train, which will connect with- the
Tiburon boat o this evening. Two hundred i
hunters left for the marshes last Saturday j
night, but there should be ft much larger j
number represented on board the hunters' !
train to-night. - /
â¢ Rail shooting on the marshes near Bel- j
mont is first-das*. George Royal, .1. E. |
Bergea and M. F. Barges bagged fifty j
birds a few days ago. During the excite- !
ment which attended' the capture of a
wounded bird Royal took a mud bath aha
was rescued from -.i â  soft snap ' by' J. E.
Berges in time to catch the train for this !
City.
o Bob Taylor and the famous French frog- j
catcher, Frank Angonnet," bagged six rail i
last Sunday on the San Mateo marshes. !
Taylor is authority for ttre statement that j
Angonnet discovered a nest of migrating i
frogs on the margin of the marsh, and j
,that * a private frog-casting tournament j
will be held to-morrow on the newly dis
covered "croakers'" preserve. ' ,',
. Some splendid bans of quail should be j
made to-morrow. The" recent rainstorm !
has materially improved the ground over i
which pointers and 'setters will- range, !
thus giving the sportsmen an excellent i
opportunity of seeing some pretty work.
T. F. Bannon and Ed Skelly of the San
Francisco Fire Department, two . crack
shots of the Mission, bagged seventy-two |
birds at Stevens Ark last Tuesday and
secured a large number of cans, being the
first of the season. They report the shoot
ing very good.

ROD AND REEL.
The Season for Catching Trout
Closed Yesterday.
Yesterday brought to a close the angling
j season of 1896, that is so far as catching
trout iti freshwater streams is concerned.
The law provides, however, for a little
sport for the lovers of the angle during
the winter months. Steelheads may be
taken with rod and line in tidewaters, and
from late intelligence received by John
Butler of 7 Sutter street, the bar at the
mouth of Russian River is now open and
a good run of fish up the river is reported.
Should a heavy rainstorm remain off for
some time anglers will flock to Duncans
Mills, which place is the headquarters of
the fraternity.
Charley Green, the veteran angler, has
fitted up a rustic cottage within close-prpx-
I imity of the river, where he intends'to
locate daring the winter. Sir Charles is at
present prospecting for new arrivals from
I old ocean, and a letter to his friend, John
j Ferguson, is daily expected.
The friends of Ed Sullivan will be
pleased to learn that the Standard Oil
Company has appointed him manager at
Los Angeles. Air. Sullivan is a prominent
member of the San Francisco Rod and
j Gun Club, and last evening he was ten
i dered a banquet by some of his near
I friends at John Bergez's Rotisserie.
! Although Ed's smiling lace will be missed

The Olympics have ; been practicing !
every night this week on a tan bark floor!
in -a v large ,; riding academy. , Two full 1
elevens have participated in" the practice j
j and the club team is in soirit ana condi-
I tion much better off than when it was
: >ignaiiy defeated by 'Berkeley two week 3 j
| ago after a week's listless practice, in- I
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 31, 1596.
spired largely by depreciation ; of i the j
strength of the State University eleven.*
Three weeks t ago Stanford and .Olympic ,
played a no-score game. It now. remains I
to be seen how to-day's score will compare
with the 24 to 8 score that cave the Berke
ley team such a boom when <it defeated i
Olympic. The - partisans of both univer-. i
sities will look upon tht>* result with inter
est as the best line so far ' obtainable. on
the relative power and skill of the two
great Varsity elevens that are to battle on
Thanksgiving. *
Code, Stanford's Varsity quarter for four
seasons,: will play with Olympic to-day.
Harrelson, the other old Stanford quarter,
who has been filling/the position, for
Olympic, is laid off with an injured hand
that will probably prevent^him from play
ing again this year. ; lie is, however, giv
ing the Olympics valuable assistance as a
coach. Sheeny, the:- big ; Olympic guard *
who is to be a' freshman at Stanford next
year, has been : playing in varsity form :
this week and is showing, much improve
ment in breaking through . and tackling,
but in Captain 'Fickert,* his opponent on.
the Stanford team, he has a formidable
man to face.
" Captain Smith has not been well this :
week and should he not feel thoroughly j
lit to-day Hobbs, Olympic's big, strong, j
new â¢'find," will play left guard. He is an
aggressive player, but lacks the experience
to make him \. valuable in an emergency
or apt to grasp a favorable opportunity.
To Theerkauf, who has not been in any of
the matches this season, Olympic looks
for at least one touchdown, his running
with the ball and his offensive work being
particularly fine.
When Stanford has the ball Stickney
will play end for Olympic, Mclsaacs, the
Berkeley player, dropping ; back-.; iuto
Stickney 'a place behind the line.. By tnis
arrangement Olympic ; feels that it will
materially improve its defensive strength.
During the week training has gone
regularly .on at Stanford. The Varsity
played two practice games, with Reliance
at the campus-: and won them botn, the
big Oakland team not being able to score. ;
Carl, the Varsity' guard, is still favoring
an injured foot, and very recently some of
the backs have been retired for repairs.
With perhaps three exceptions Stanford
will have its strongest eleven in the field
to-day. But there is an abundance of
gooa material for many' of the positions
and little individual difference in the ,
ability of. pood men to fill them. The
team will go into the game -with the,
encouraging feeling that Stanford has not
been scored against this season in the two
matches and three practice .came?* ;â¢
With the return of the Oregon yester
day Olympic has- several likely e!ij;ibles
within reach. Next week three naval offi- :
cers that played on the Annapolis Acad-.
emy team witl practice with the Olympics.
They are: Cavanaah, center rush, and
â  reputed the best all-round player ever j
turned out of Annapolis; McCormacfk, ex
captain and end for Annapolis," who may,,
play end to-day; and Kairns^ an Annapo-. j
li's guard, who will probably iry for
tackle. A3 will Cavanagh the center.
"Tommy" Code, the Pai'o Alto veteran
quarter, a*nd member of the Olympic Club
since his High School Cays here : in the
City, returned Tuesday from the Oregon ,
i Agricultural College, where c he went sev
eral weeks ago as football .cogch.'.Hje tells
a laughable story of his. experience with,
o the embryonic webiooted farmers, who,
he says, had football fever, but no appe
tite for the game. > '
At their earnest request he exhibited
himself one day in football clothes and
mixed up in their, practice. The next day
the men could not be coaxed out, and
those that little Code had performed ex
hibition tackles on knew that they were
goin^ to die, while . the^ all agreed 0 that
if that was a sample of. the way men i
played in California football could not be !
such a tine game as they had supposed. I
Code was always noted as a poor catcher.
That was his greatest fault asa layer.
Bat his Oregon pupils did not know it.
They ask*e,d, him to show them how to I
catch a punt. He swelled but his chest,
for his reputation was -at stake, and, as
suming a confident air, tried for., the .first
one and caught it. Surprised and pleased, j
he braced himself for another and actually
held it. Then he quit and, with a wave of
the hand, "he remarked: '"Well, it's' a
simple thing; you see how it's done."
And the college still thinks that its Cali
fornia coach had football skill beyond its I
power to acquire. .
This afternoon the champion light- i
â¢weight football team: of the coast from
the Y. M. C. A. will play its first game of
the season with" the Peralta University â 
Academy of Berkeley at the Sixteenth and
Folsom street grounds.
â¢ The Y. M. C. A.'s are this year cap
tained by L. W. mines, under whose
watchful ey< the team lias been , training
for the past six weeks. A fast and inter
esting, game is expected, cas both teams

CRICKET.
Captain Robartson Reviews the Past
Seasonâ Timely Suggestions.
In my limited knowledge .of cricket as it is
played in California I don't recollect any
such season as the one just gone through. It
will stand as a red-letter one .for years and
years, and may be many of us old fogics^ow
gracing the green sward with our artistic but
very often not useful presence will loolc back
to it in tne future with satisfaction ai>d
pleasure when cricket will have, oncfe more*
degenerated into its old humdrum style of
the days of ' 49, or rather 'B6.
Taking cricket right through the season it
may confidently be asserted that the excite
ment among the patrons of the game has been
most intense and has by the keen rivalry
existing between the clubs and players con
testing for the cup cnuscd many heartburn
ings and wailings from winner.-; and losers
alike.
Now, however, that everything is adjusted
to the satisfaction of everybody and ail those
liitle jealousies and rivalries so essential to
the lite of nearly every cricketer have been
forgotten and buried, 1 have been requested to
| give a short resume of the doings of the year
dv that thorough sportsman ana cricketer.
Mr. M. J. Geary* the sporting editor of The
Call.
The closeness of the finish for the cup has
been to me a matter of great gratification, and
I believe every lover ot the game shares my
views on that subject. Tnat only one point'
should separate the Pacifies from tho Ho
j hemian.% after contesting some eighteen
games, talks for Itself; the Alauiedas running
| an unusual but fairly good third. The class
of cricket seen in these matches has been on
the whole very stood, but at times rather in
and out, showing the necessity for more
regular practice by 'many of our plavcrs. More
so in the batting departmesit do I notice this,
for on many occasions have I seen a -really
sound batsman get nabued up before nis eye
was fairly on the ball, while interior men
would perform miracles with the bat against
the same bowling.
Standing out prominently among the con-
Blatant cmb batsmen may be mentioned Rich*
urdsonâ who, however, only participated in a
limited numtur of eaines. lie well kept up
his name and troubled all and every bowler
who came n^ainst him. The same "may be
said of Dave Hearlield, and It is to be regretted
that the cricket public does not tee more of
him. Then Teddy Hood dia yeoman service
on many occasions for his club, mid "but lor
the painful accident to his hand no doubt
would even have improved on himself.
Hogue's work on the field won him the
plaudits of the spectators on many occasions.
While no one in purlieu lur distinguished him
self in the l'acinos, yet the lact of their only
losing by one sinull paint speaks volumes for
the all-round quality of their men. Bauer,
Wiseman. Myers, Sinvall, Dickinson, Theobald
| arui others were never found wanting.
The Bohemians have to thank the lucky and
I goo'i start they got for winning the cup, but
i no duiibt the fine batting and lidding te.'un,
I not to say anything about bowling, that lirsi
downed the oid red and wnue colors, if it
cculd have baea kept together would have
I doubly assured the ou'.comc. Reynolds did
j very weil on almost every occasion he put un
: the flannels, which should have been oftcner.
j Smith, Martin and West, who all opened out
j well, were called from tho City on business,
j but Bownill ably seconded his captain in
piling on the runs on many occasions and dis
closed a return to- his old Lelth-Caledonian
form. In the other clubs Brookes, Hellruan,
Ward and others made tome useful runs wiieii
I most waated. What we most need here are
bowlers and our local clubs should look round
for some new talent.
It must De patent to the most prejudiced
willow-wielfUys that the Bohemians' cowling
won them tho trophy this year. For thirteen
consecutive games Cooksort and their other
bowler trundled unchanged. The Pacifies, in
Dickinson, have, a lirst-cinss, reliable man,
using good judgment, lie very seldom failed
lo get on the spot. Cassidy helped him well.
While the tall sycamore from Telegraph "Hill"
did â¢ lot ot uphill work for the clut). But,
shades of Alamedal where are you, ye ex
ehampious? Ncr belter than third in the race.
I simply place it to internal disagreements,
for t lie team seems equal to" cope with the
others. \Yard has bowled well, but with not
such luck, maybe, as formerly. S.oman is the
same Slomnn, nnd just as good. While I'eel
has come on in great styie, both-with fhe bat
and b<Â«Il. There is no lack of talenjt, but to my
mind it resolves itself 'down lo this: that to
bring that talent out, practice â good, hard,
regular practice â must be indulged In two or
three times a week.
.That some suitable ground in this City
should be secured to enaole this to be carried
out is my idea. When, and only when, this is
dono can we expect to see a-team of capable,
fearless cricketers array themselve* w.itli any
chance of success against the seasoned veter
ans of the Ertst or Australia. This was amply
proven in the iate mutch against the Austral
ian eleven, when our baiting fell entirely to
pieces, ana although minus Hearfield, Jack
son, Kinliardson. Reynolds, Peel or J. C. Kob
ertson certainly aid not disci use anything like
its true form.
Tlie way, however, the two Bohemian trr.n
dlers disposed of the celebrated eleven no
doubt was an unioreseen surprise to the spec
tators and a matter for congratulation among
the team, who fully expected at least one good
day's leather-bunting. Because th^ good
points of the ~ame did not escape my notice I
trust that those who rvad these few lines will
acquit me of any selfish motive in thtis bringing
them to their notice, us likewise of any inten
tion to make needless excuses. for our fiilure
to score off the lightning deliveries of Jones,
nor the deceptive wobblers of McKinnbn,
Trott, etal. Yours, etc.,- W. Roberston.

COLONEL TAYLOR'S
ELECTION SURE
Betting Men Disposed to
Give Odds Against
the Field.
Said to Be Impossible to Cut
Enough Out of His Follow-
ing to Defeat 3 Him. â¢
HE IS MAKING A HOT FIGHT.
Something About the Next Mayor's
Active Lie in Business and
Politics in This City.
Betting men are giving odds on the elec
tion of C. L. Taylor for Mayor. They
have it all figured out. It is estimated
that the man that gets 18,000 votes in the
Mayoralty lace is a winner. In the race
for the Supervisorship last year, with just
as many opponents in the field as he has
now, Colonel Taylor piled up 28,000 votes
and lead the procession. People who
claim to know things about politics say
that there is no influence, combination or
man with a pull in the present light, hot
as it is, that can filcn from him so many
as 10,000 of those votes. The most con
servative among the expert poÃtical statis
ticians afld proDhets place the number of
his votes at not less than 10,000. They
back their estimates on knowledge of the
influences at work in tbe campaign and
the strength and following of all the can
didates.
Colonel Taylor is nutting up a hot fight.
His younger competitors have some diffi
culty in keeping to his pace. He has,
however, one big advantage, or. rather,
several big advantages. He knows poli
tics â is on a familiar footing with the art
of conducting a campaign. lie knows
and is known by the people. Ho has no
explanations to make. His long record in
the public service, beginning away back
in the fifties and almost unrnteiriiptea
down to the present time, is perfectly
clean. Almost the only work laid out for j
him is to become acquainted with the new ]
crop of voters. Colonel Taylor visits a
number of gatherings of voters every day
and night. His presence" never fails to
impress those present as tnat of a man of
absolute sincerity and honesty of pur
pose, coupled with that -of stfong com
mon sense, force ot character and business
ability.
Colonel Taylor's public career was be
gun as School Director in 1858, and in that j
position he distinguished himself by tak- ;
ing possession ot school lots which were j
held bys-quatters. That feat was a bit of :
history-making at that time. The prob- j
lein ot securing the lots vexed the School j
Board for some time. Colornel Taylor i
with .his- usual force and determination j
offered to solve the problem ii the bonrd j
empowered him to do so. The word was |
given, and with a force of men he e*xe- j
cuted a coup in the early hours of the J
morning. Tho squatters, hearing of the i
move, armed themselves and, led by j
Colonel Stevenson, made a sally to recover i
possession of the property. They found
Colonel Taylor witji his force entrenched
behind board fences and, considering dis- j
cretion the better part of valor, they re
tired..
In 18G3 Colonel Taylor was elected a
member of the Harbor Commission on the
State ticket at the head of which was Gov
ernor Lowe.
In 1871, without seeking or desiring the
office. Colonel Taylor was re-elected a
member of the Harbor "Commission. He
filed his certificate and bond and then
sent to the Governor his resignation, as'
hia business interests prevemed him from
giviii2 ihe necsssary time to tbe duties of
the otlice.
He is now serving his third terra as a
member of the Board ot Supervisors.
Colonel Taylor has been prominent for
many years in business circles and his
record there, as in his public service, is of i
the very best. He was one of the organ
izers of the Mechanics' Institute in 1853,
and for many yenrs exerted his best ef
forts toward placing that splendid insti
tution on a sound footing. He is now one
of its honorary members. He was also
active in the organization of the Chamber
of Commerce and is one of its ex-presi
dents.
He was a large shipowner for many
years, his vessels being engaged in the
coasting trade. He afterward put on a
line of sailing vessels between Australia
and this port and also a packet line he
tw^een here and Boston. He was one of
the pioneers in the development of the
salmon industry in Alaska.
He organized the first military company
of San Francisco ar.d was colonel of the
first regiment of cavalry, =most of the
companies of whi^h were mustered into
the service of the Union after the breaking
out of the war. He organized the first
company â known as the California 100 â
which went from this State to serve the
Nation in its time of distress.
He is a prominent member in a number
of fraternal societies, among them, for
forty years past, the Masons and Odd
Fellows.

In crowded hotels, on the banker's desk,
' j in the merchant's office, in the haunts of
bicyclists, in army tents on the most dis-
tant outposts, in colleges where young
men cultivate both mind and muscle, in
; the studios of painters, the dusty dens of
i lawyers, the book-lined retreats of preach-
er?," wherever athletes are training, in
schoolrooms, in homes and on board ships
at â your eyes are sure to fall upon the
red pyramid.
For many years African travelers and
explorers, including Livingstone, Barth,
I Stanley, Hooker, Binger.and others, have
! reported the existence there of a nut, the
chewing of which enabled the natives to
perform feats of endurance and strength
wholly impossible without it. It was said
; to be* a life-renewing agent of immense
I potency, yet harmless as bread â the only
) stimulant therefore known without reac-
I tion or any bad effect.
These reports proving true, many at-
tempts were made, especially during the
past twenty-five years, to furnish products
I of this nut which would be to civilization
! j what the nut -itself was to the natives.
' I The need of this arose from" the. fact that
the nut quickly decomposed when taken
from the tree, and could not therefore be
marketed in foreign countries.
These attempts were all failures until
the Brunswick Pnarmncal Company of 92 =
William street, New York, . solved the
| pro&lem and ' cave to j the public their
: Kolalra preparations. . , . ?
The chief of these, Yino-Kolafra, con-
tains all the properties of the Sterculia
nut. As : a stimulant and. tonic it is be-
yond comparison. It braces and invigor-
ates body and mind, doing no barm what-
ever to either. It revitalizes the strong
and lifts invalids and the naturally weak
jupto a higher level. It has none of the
I reactionary qualities of alcoholic stimu-
Jants.> No haoit follows tne use of Vino-
Kolafra. It is now almost universally
employed by athletes and invalids, and
the "first case of any but beneficial results
has yet to be reported.
Nature's blessings are mostly mixed, but
one* id aweary while she presents us with
Jan all-round good thine â a clean; straight
I ben-son, without an "if," an "and" or a
"but." And Vino-Kolafra seems to be one
of these golden gifts. . ;

OF RANDSBURG
Officers Save John Buster
and His Son From
Lynching.
Miners Had Resolved to Mete
Justice for the Taking of
Human Life.
THWARTED BY lAWS MINIONS
The Two Men Hurried to Mojave's
Jai -âDetails of Thursday's
Fight.
BAKERSFIELD, Cal., Oct. 30.â John
Buster Br. and John Buster Jr., two oi the
principals in the shooting affray yester
day morning- at Randsburg, the mining
town on the Mojave Desert, were lodged
in jail at Mojave to-nighU They were
hurried out of Randsburg by officers to
preycDt a lynching, the miners at the
camp having recently agreed to nang the
next man who shot a fellow human, it be
ing hoped by the hardy toilers that by
making an example of some one they
would check lawlessness at the aesert
mines. From later and more complete
details of the affray it appears that if the
Busters were not the aggressors, they were
at least guilty of attacking a man who a
few minutes before had "the drop" on
them and spared them.
Thompson's saloon, in which the shoot
in 2 took place, Is a frame and canvas
structure on Jerusalem Flat, at the junc
tion of Fiddlers' Gulch and Randsburg
road. George Wooster was in the place
playing poker with John Buster Sr. Bus
ter had been in camp some time, and a
few days ago was joined by his son, John
Buster Jr., who came from San Pedro.
M'ooster accused the old man of cheating
by the aid of his son. Young Buster at
once drew a knife and started ior Wooster.
The latter stappetl back, and the bar
keeper, a youth.named Fesler, passed him
a Winchester rifle which had been stand
ing behind the bar. Quictc as a flash
Wooster leveled it at Buster and shouted:
"Throw up your hands, or I'll blow
your head off!" â 
Up went Buster's hands and down went
the knife on the floor. The old man
picked" it upj fcut as he made no attempt
to iise.it Wooster gave the rifl â¢ back to
â  the barkeeper and went out. In a short
time he returned and immediately on en
tering the saloon he was attacked by the
' Blisters. The .younger man got Wooster
up against the wall and held his arms to
nis sides' while the old man stabbed him
in\ the thigh and- back, inflicting bad
wound sf .
The account of the affray now grows
confused. A rifle was seen in Wooster's
hands and afterward in young Buster's,
â  and then the shooting began. Bartender
.Fesler got out a six-shooter and joined in.
Quite a number oÂ£ shots were fired and the
. Busters ran out of the saloon. When the
fight was over it was found tbat a man
lay in the road r some 200 or 300 feet away.
He was Frank Auk, who had recently
.come to Randsburg with his stepfather,
â¢ James Stewart of Visalia, brother of
George Stewart, editor of the YisaMa
Delta. Ault had not been in the saloon at
- all and was eoing cp the road to look
after his team when he met his death. An
examination of the bod y showed that he
had been shot in the back, the bullet pass
. ing completely through the abdomen.
"After passing through the body the bullet
.went over 100 feet and struck a post in a
blacksmith-shop. Ault lived for some
time after bein.- shot.
Deputy Sheriff J. If. Crawford and
. Constable Claude Bohannon were asleep
at the time of the affray, but heard the
shots and at once hastened to the scene.
The two Busters were put under firrest,
as was young Fesler, who, it is said, con
fessed that he did some of the shooting,
batthat he was trying to protect Wooster
from young Buster, who was firing his
â¢ rifle promiscuously. It was found that a
buiiet had passed through the younger
Buster's ear, but neither of the men was
" otherwise injured.
Fearing the result should the prisoners
be kept in camp until the tragedy became
known, after the miners' .decision to
lynch, the next person who shot any one,
a team was at once procured and as soon
as possible Crawford and Bohannon start
ed with trie for Mojave. The rage
of the miners was great when they learned
tbat Ault had been killed and his sup
posed Blayers were out of their grasp.
SLOOK MINRIE MINING.
Hat Undoubtedly Gone to the Bottom
With Her Pansengera.
" ' TACOMA, Wash., Oct. 30.â The last
issue of the Alaska Mining Record, whicn
', was received to-day, says:
The sloop Birdie, of which Dr. Gardner,
formerly of Juneau and well known in
i southeastern Alaska, is owner and
master, sailed from Cooks Inlet for
\ Juneau early in July, with two or three
passengers. Nothing has since been seen
or heard of the sloop. It was Gardner's
â  intention to at once return to the inlet.
The boat wa3 a double-ended craft of three
or four tons burden, and there is little
doubt that she has gone to the bottom.
The names* of her passengers are unknown
' at Juneau.
SUICIDE AT OAK FLAT.
William H. Martin Endn Mia Life With
a Uifle Ball.
WEAVERVILLE, Cal., Oct. 30.âWil
liam H. Martin committed suicide yester
day at Oak Flat, on Stu&rts Fork, near the
Brittan cabin, by shooting himself in the
mouth with a 44-caliber Winchester! '
Martin was a witness in Redding on a
mineral land case on October 14, and there
seems to be some suspicion that he has
met with foul play. Latterly he seemed
to have been depressed about the testi
mony be gave in reference to tne case.
The Coroner and posse started on horse
back for the scene of the tragedy to-night.

BRITISH COLUMBIA'S BOOM.
Valuable Mining Properties Being Opened
Up in the Vicinity of Vancouver
and Victoria
VANCOUVER, B. C, Oct. 30.â The
British Columbia mining fever, which
started in Eastern Canada, has swept over
the mountains and broken out in this
province.
When the large cities in the East were
nervously exited over the reports circu
loted broadcast of rich strikes in the
British Columbia mines, the people of the
province were not at all agitated, and for
over a year there was not the slightest
evidence of a boom. But the excitement
in tne East, coupled with the continued
arrival of mining experts sent here by
English and American syndicates, has at
length aroused the phlegmatic British
Columbians to a proper realization of the
situation.
At present the greatest excitement pre
vails in Vancouver and Victoria, owing to
the splendid strikes that have been made
within a few miles of this city. The
Golden Cache minesâ which average $500
or over to the ton, with a million tons
practically in sight and a probability of an
unlimited quantity uncovered â are about
200 miles frr-m Vancouver or Cay use
Creek. They are being developed, also
the Tascado Island mines, some forty
miles from Vancouver, specimens from
which run thousands of dollars to the ton
in free milling gold, which can be dug out
with a penknife. The Charm Mining
Company's claims are on Philips Arm, a
short distance from this city, on which a
large gang of men at work and which
Bhowsgood indications and actual results
that the stock has doubled during the past
week.
The Philips Arm quartz claim, near by,
is a shipper at a big protit, and numerous
excellent properties at Hour Sound, a few
miles distant, and at Pitt Lake, some
twelve miles distant, are sufficient reasons
for the present to warrant citizens of the
coast towns in declaring that the sea
board mines, and those other than are
known as inland properties, will receive
the greatest prominence of any iv the
province within a very short time.

Sim-mons, manager of the Parkersburg
salmon cannery on the Coquille River,
was held up in his office last night by two
masked men, who demanded that he open
the safe. Simmons refused and the rob

fury tbat he changed his mind, but the
desperadoes did not hear him say tbat he
would open the safe. During the scuffle
Simmons caught hold of the'niasfc of one
of the robbers and tore it from his face, so
that he recognized him. This frightened
the robbers away.
Simmons has several flesh wounds on
his head and is under a doctor's care.
Who the robber whom he recognized is,

PEACE UNTIL THANREGIVINS.
Student Body l>cfer* Action on Musical
Club Cnnatituton*.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Oct.
30. â Stanford musical organizations com
manded the attention of the student body
tnls afternoon. At the last meeting of
the executive committee constitutions of
the various musical clubs were submitted.
These constitutions practically removed
the glee, mandolin ana banjo clubs from
general student control. Action on the
matter was deferred until the next meet
ing of the committee. This proved un
satisfactory to the clubs concerned, and a
student body meeting was called.
After the usual preliminaries the ques
tion was resolved to tnis: Whether or not
action should be taken on the proposed
changes until after the student body en
tertainment Thanksgiving night.
The motion that action be deferred pre
vailed after an hour of discussion. Zion
'94 and Wilson '96 spoke for the clubs. I
Bell '97, O'Neal '97 and Brown '97
spoke for a delay in action, ursihg that as
arrangements had been made for the ap
pearance of these clubs on Thanksgivine
night the student body should protect
itself by postponing legislation until after
the entertainment.
LOS ANGELES PRIERFIGHT
Young liempney nnd Jack Burkhardt
Quit With Honor* Miaay.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Oct. 30.â A large
crowd saw the boxing exhibition before
the Los Angeles Athletic Club to-night.
The principal event was a flfteen-rouad go
between Young Dempsey (Jack Watson)
and Jr.ck Burkhardt, both of this city.
The men weighed 135 pounds each and
were well matched, putting up the best
fight ever seen at the club.
Dempsey, who was the cleverer of the
two, got his man when he led and had the
better of the mix-up generally. He was
remarkably quick on his feet and had no
difficulty in escaping from a corner,
Burkhardt vainly poking the atmosphere.
While Burkhardt was deficient in
science he made up for this in strength
and grit, and kept at his opponent all the
time following him about the ring and
doing a big part of the leading. He took
plenty of punishment.
Burkhardt gave Dempsey a lively brush
in the fifteenth round, but the latter was
too clever and Kept out of *'-c ot.er's
i reach. The fizht was extended t eighteen
rounds, the last especially being fast and
lurious, but the mill resulted in a draw.

THE ARAGO INQUIRY
It Is Now Claimed That the Wreck
Was Caused by Adverse
Supervising Inspector Bermingham yes
terday instituted an inquiry into the
causes which brought about tne wreck of
the steamer Arago October 20, whereby
fourteen lives were lost. Inspector Bolles
conducted the investigation, and as he
was new to such proceedings only four
witnesses were examined, further inquiry
going over until Monday.
From thte evidence introduced it appears
that the wreck wus caused by an adverse
and hitherto unknown current, combined
with a heavy sea and a dense log. The
first officer, A. G. Bank-, swore the
weather was hazy and that ths engines
were stopped to watch a "smooth cuance"
to cross the bar. Just before the vessel
struck he noticed .a current settling to the
northward. The witness also swore that
no soundings were maiie and that the
vessbl sank within ten minutes after she
struck.
Peter Borgman, who was at the wheel,
said that when opposite the jetty two or
three big seas came which threw the
Arago completely off -her course. He
turned the wheel to the starboard, but the
vessel did not promptly respond. She
then bepan to come back, finally striking
her stern. F. Grogan, first assistant en
gineer, swore substantially to the facts
above recorded, dwelling particularly on
the adverse currents. Probably the most
important evidence of the day was found
in an affidavit made by the life-saving
crew. It reads as fellows:
Emfip.e City, Or., Oct. 25, 1896.
In connection with the recent wreck of the
steamer Arago on October 20, 1896, on the
Government jetty on the north side of Coos
Bay, we, the undersigned members of the
United States .life-saving crew of Coos Bay,
who manned tho lifeboat on that morning,
wish to state that we found the current in that
locality of the jetty and wreck running strong
in a northerly direction on that morning and
in an opposite direction to what the curmit
usually runs or has run in that locality a: that
stage of the flood tide.

THE MAYOR'S TICKET.
Those Whom Mr. Sutro Wbuld Like to
See in Office.
The following letter and list are self
explanatory:*
Fellow - citizens : Election day has arrived.
Every political party, faction and clique has
made, up itÂ»ticket, and the result is a mass of
names utterly embarrassing to the confused
voters.
In dismay well may they ask, "For whom
shall we vÂ»te 1" Without a most elaborate
and extended investigation it seems impossi
ble to make a proper selection, and so, blindly,
from habit, they may vote a party ticket and
thus carry into office the very men they do not
want.
Out of the tickets on flic* In the Registrar's
office I had at first intended to choose an entire
ticket, but ultimately, ior sufficient reason,
concluded to confine the selection to the
Board of Supervisors.
The question of the good government of the
City is not political; it is local and appeals to
all independently oi any National considera
tion. Under our present laws the Supervisors
are '.he ruling powtr and direct practically all
the affairs of the City. They settle the basis
of taxation, they lookafter the distribution of
all the money ana have the entire control of
finance. Their right selection is therefore of
the utmost importance.
In choosing a board I have, of course, to'taice
the material at my command, and in offering
the names on this list I cannot personally
guarantee the outconr*, though in several cases
I know personally and in the others have been
assured by competent men that the members
chosen are thd best that could have been se
lected.
As regards tbtt charter, I have finally con
cluded to oppose it. Under it, practically, the
whole power of the City is invested in the
Mayor.- If the "bosses" and the corporations
have heretofore managed our elections and
been generally able to control the selection of
the Supervisors, they will, in my opinion,
when it suits their purpose have the like
power to choose the Mayor, and for that reason
I do not think it the part of wisdom to vote
now for a new charter.
We have tho power of selection. Let us try
a good board, such as is supposed to be
contained in the list hereto appended. If
they prove really good the Mayor will be of
m i n o- consequence; if they prove derelict in
their duty there will then be time enough to
lrnme a new charter that will give the Mayor
greater but not such arbitrary power. Re
spectfully submitted, Adolph Sutro.
The following are the Mayor's selec
tions:
BTJPERVISORB.
First Ward, Lawrence Devany, voting num

campaign was closed in this city to-night with
a monster street parade and speeches id the

drilling of the Plumed Knights, Young Men's

H. Payne as the chairman of the evening. He
in turn introduced Judge A. L. Friclt as the
speaker of the evening.
Mr. Frick took up the silver arguments of
the Popocrats, and one by one answered them
in a. manner highly satisfactory to his hearers.
He closed by paying a glowing tribute to
the county candidates-, and urged his audi
dience to stand by them at the polls on Tues
day. He made a personal appeal for Con
gressman Hilboru, who beat him at the pri
maries last spring. He was wildly applauded
at the mention of Hilborn's name.
Hon. James A. Waymire, candidate for the
Legislature from this district, urged his hear
ers not to be fooled by the plea for free silver
as they were four years ago on the cry of free
tariff.
Hon. 8. G. Hilborn was greeted with three
rousing cheers as he appeared. He prophe
sied a Republican victory next Tuesday and
declared that it would set the wheels of pros
perity whirring for the next thirty years.
ILLINOIS SAFE.
Senator S. M. Cullom Has No Doubt
Tbat His State Â« ill Go for
McKinley.
The following letter is self-explanatory:
Chicago, 111., Oct. 25. 1896.
Hon. P. L. KoscialGwski, San Francisco, Cal.â
My Dear Sin and Kkiend: Your lavor of the
19th inst. has been received and noted. 1 am
pleased to hear that California will most
surely give Its electoral vote to Major Mc-
Kinley, our candidate for President of the
United States. There is not the slightest
question in my mind .but that I.linois
will give a very large majority for
McKinley and for the whole Republican ticket,
including our candidate, for Governor, which
will result in the defeat of John P. Altgeld,
the present occupant of that office. I have no
doubt whatever but that McKinley will be
elected President of the United States by an
overwhelming majority; neither do I have any
doubt about the result as to the House of Rep
resentatives. If we shall be able to control
the Senate, we will have the administration
and a Congress in harmony with it, which will
insure the return of confidence and whir.h
will result in a revival of business; the hard
times of ihe last .three and a half years will
pais away and good times will come again.
Wishing you good health, I am, as ever, very
truly yours, b. M. Cullom.

ALFORID ANSWERED.
A Tart Letter Sent In Reply to His
Beggm? Circular.
The Call recently published a copy of
a circular letter sent out to Postmasters in
California by Chairman Alford of the
Democratic Campaign Committee. Some
of the persons have replied and some have
ignored the communication altogether.
In the majority of cases it is believed
that the boy manager of the boy orator's
campaign has not derived much aid and
comfort from the answers returned. The
Reading Free Press of the 27th inst. pub
lishes the following epistle from Asa T.
Fitzpatrick.a Postmaster in Shasta County,
repudiating the Democracy of the Bryan
brand, and it is sure that this letter ex
presses the sentiments of a great many
Democrats throughout the country:
United States Postoffice, Â»
Buexky, Shasta County. Cal.,>
October 20, 1890. >
Hon. William H. Alford, Chairman Democratic
Siate Central Committeeâ Dear Sin: Yours of
the 15th inst., calling on me fora contribution
to your campaign lund of 3 per cent of my
salary as Postmaster, received. With this ap
plication you say "Do not force us to tho con
clusion by your silence that you consider the
proposition unfavornbly, but let us hear from
you at once," and I take the earliest oppor
tunity of settiug your mind at rest on the
subject.
I am not In sympathy with the principles
promulgated by the Chicago convention. I
believe that "the laborer is worthy of his hire"
in honest dollars, and that he will not receive
them if demagogues succeed in foisting upon
this country an unstuhle currency by the free
and unlimited coinage of silver. In this con
nection I will say that jny bread and butter
depends more on the sale of products, raised
by my labor from the soil of Burner Valley,
than it does from the "cancellations." of Bur
ney Postoffice, and when I sell those products
I want to receive pay for them in a money
the fluctuations of which I will not have to
"cipher ont" in order to ascertain its value.
I have been taught to regard the Supreme
CQart of the United States as the bulwark and
safeguard of our form of Government, and I
cannot countenance the threat to reconstruct
it in the interest of anarchy.
That I may not be considered inconsistent
or ungrateful to the party that has honored
me I beg to remind you that I hold my com
mission from a Democratic administration
which represents the true principles of
Democracy and has nothing in common with
and is uncompromisingly opposed to the
ruinous principles to which you ask me to
subscribe.
Hoping that the un-American and unholy
doctrines which you are advocating will be
put so soundly to sleep on the 3d day of No
vember that even the tooting of Gabriel's
horn on the morning of the resurrection will
not awaken them, I am wry respectfully yours,
Asa T. Fitzpatrick, Postmaster.

A HARDY PIONEER,
Talkg of Early Life in the West and His
Battle With Disease.
From the Graphic, Newberg, Or.
Mr. Sebastian Brutscher of Newberg, Or.,
was a forty-niner. He has been a resident of
Yamhill County ever since, serving many
years as County Commissioner, and has al
ways been a reliable public servant. He is
now 70 years old. The exposure and hard
work incident to pioneer life has most
seriously affected Mr. Brutscher's health. Of
late years he has suffered with rheumatism,
luag trouble, constipation and piles, a general
run down condition of the system and loss of
memory. After many physicians had failed
to render him any assistance he began on Dr.
Williams' Pink Pills with the result, as he
says, they have done him more good than all
ether remedies combinedâ his system is built
up, rheumatism gone, bowels regular, and he
feels brighter and younger by several years;
his memory is restored, has no trouble to
speak names readily, and this of itself is a
great satisfaction to him- He says he can
recommend them to any one similarly afflicted,
believing they will be greatly benefited by
their use.
John D. Boatman, a farmer living one mile
from Newberg, is a veteran of the late war.
He enlisted for three yeÃrs and after his dis
charge at the expiration of that time re
enlisted and served to the end of the war. He
was a member of -the Fourteenth Regiment
Cavalry, Kansas Volunteers, and is now a
member of Kilpatrick Post, G. A. R., at New
berg, Or.
In an interview Mr. Boatman said he had
kidney trouble from the time of coming out of
the army. Later he had rheumatism, nervous
trouble and general debility. Has been
treated for a long time by two as good phy
sicians as there are in Yamhill County, all
without avail. His money was all spent, his
time was gone and he was in a worse condi
tion than before.
He had heard of a remarkable cure in this
county by the uso of Williams' Pink Pills for
Pale People, so two years ago bo i; lit two
boxes of the pills and began using mem ac
cording to the directions. He was soon con
vinced that he had struck the proper remedy.
He was soon free from pain, nerves steady and
felt so well that after he had taken the pills
for a time he thought himself cured per- '
manently. But from exposure and hard work j
he found that he had discontinued their use j
too soon, so he bought more, took them and I
now considers himself well and is able to do ,
any farmwork required. He does not take any !
of the pills now, but keeps a box of them in
the house all the timiÂ». However, and says he
will never be without them if he has to sell a
horse to get the money with which to buy
them.
John E. Smith, a respectable citizen of New
beig and a prominent member of the Metho
dist church, who came to Oregon irom the
Mississippi Valley some years ago, has been
fifflicted nearly all his life with liver nnd
nervous troubles, neuralgia, etc. He has taken
great quantities of medicine with but little
effect. Some time ago he bought some of the
Pink Pills and now says he has received more
real benefit from them than all other medi
cine he has ever taken.
These testimonials are given voluntarily by
conservative and truthful men, each one say
ing that he would not misrepresent the facts
nor would he try to deceive any one, but they
have simply given the result of their own ex
periment with the pills, with which they are
well satisfied. J. C. Sawyer, Postmaster,
Newberg, Oregon.
This is to certify that I am acquainted with I
the persons making the above testimonials j
and :hat they a^e representative and reiiaDle ;
citizens of this community, and knowinjr i
nothing to the contrary believe their state- ;
ments made herein (o be true.
A. M. Hadlbt, Reporter,
Newberg, Or.
Dr. Williams' Pink Piils contain, in a con
densed form, all the elements necessary to I
give new life and richness to the blood and re
store scattered nerves. They are an unfailing
specific for such diseases as locomotor ataxia,
partial paralysis, St. Vnus' dance, sciatica,
neuralgia, rheumatism, nervous headache, the
after effect of la grippe, palpitation of the
heart, pa.c and sallow complexion, all forms
of weakness either in male or female. Pink
Pills are sold by all dealers, or will be sent
postpaid on receipt of price, 50 cents a box,
or six boxes for $2 50 (they are never sold in
bulk or by the 100), by addressing Dr. Wil
liams' Medicine Company, Schenectady, N. Y.

The Bradstreet Mercantile 'Agency report* 30
?e!lÃresfor the Pacific Coast States and Territories
for tbe week ending yesterday as compared with 23
Jcr the previous week and 22 for the corresponding

EXPORTS OF WINE.
Erpc.rts of W!ue from san Francisco during the
first nine months of 1596 were 11,126,000 gallons,

in 1895.
THE IN'FLEX OF GOLD.
The Xew York" circular of Ilenry Clews, under
Â° date of October 24, says: "Lonion appears to be
uneasy under the -.ires state of the lorelcn ex.
changes, and surest.* that 'something must De
done to stop tbe^low of gold to the United states.'
It is not, however, very easy .to see w-hat that
â  'something' may be. If England and 'India, and
Australia, to say nothing of other countries af
flicted with short crops, must continue io
â  buy our wheat and maize, and if they have
to "pay 20 cents more for tlielr wheat than the
price of two months "ago â both of which seem
to be â  inevitableâ and if we continue the larger
current contraction of our imports which
' at present is the actual driftâ tben England
. may find hÂ« r trade balance with the United states
in such a shape as to compel her to remit still
further considerableaniuiints of gold to this conn?
. try. .Under ordinary circumstances she might' in
â¢ Mich a trade situation as now exists, find relief in.
' forcing a return of cur securities; but ihi- British
holders of our investments just, now appear.nn.
-' usually unwilling to part with them, and ten.<;ays,
â¢' . hence an c"vent mar be-exp^cted to happen in this
"country that will cause an Important efflux of our
. securities to >oudon. . Clearly, therefore, England
'â¢ Is likely to find furlher important shipments o?
' gold to this country inevitable; and the -some
thing'which sue needs to do must be done with
some metropolis other than >"ew York."
CONDITION OF THE WHEAT CHOP.
A Toronto letter says: "Statis;ical position of
Canadian crops is far lees favorable than for a
number of seasons. Last year Manitoba raised
32,000. 000 bushels Of wheat: this year there are
only 15,0-o.obo. Cash wheat is now selling in
Ontario at 78to SOc' .
It is concluded that 50,000,000 bushels is a lib
' eral estimate for the whea: crop of Great Britain
; tji is year.
The French wheat crop is estimated at from
327,000.000 to 344.000,000 bushels.
: In Germany the wheat crop Is a poor average,
except in Prussia . where it is officially repor.ed
b-!ow the average, it ns Â»v be expected that tne
â wheat Import of "1H36-97 will exceed the average
ana that a larger proportion than usual ni.l come
â¢ from the United S:a:es.
In o: her European countries the reports art as
â â  â¢ follows:
Denmarkâ Wheat is a eood avernce. The sow
ings oi m nter wheat are now well along.
Hpalnâ The defici' of the year is estimated to ex
ceed 34.000,000 bushels, more than double tilat of
last year.
Austria-Hungaryâ Wheat under average anC re
ports as to corn crop are not optimistic.
Italy â An average crop all around.
Koumaniaâ l he estimate is t9.0U0.000 bushels
of wheat. The corn crop is extremely disappoint
ing ami the same .statement is made about nil the
Dttnubian countries.
Ki:ssiaâ t here Is a big deficiÂ»ncv in the Russian
wheÂ»t croi\ The highest estimate puts the crop
at ?.74.00J,000 bushels, the lowest number 300,-

during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect pom s of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hieh" means high barometric pressure and
is usually accomoanied by fair weather: "low"
i- firs to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompmi(;d by cloudy weather and rains.
â¢'Lows" us ally first appear on the Washlncton
coast. When the pressure is high in th* Interior
and low along the coasi.and the isobars extend
north aud south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" Is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, anl
the pressure falling to the California coas'. warmer
wentlur may be expected in summer and colder
. weather in winter. The reverse of these condition*
- wai produce an opposite result.

tion and at no time did he rap for call loans ad
vance the figures of yesterday, and in the after
noon . the quotation dropped io G percent per an
num, at which the final transactions were effected.
The decline in money was ihe restrtt of a confer
ence last â  slit by the presidents of downtown
banks, at which fourteen of the leading Institu
tions were represented. .It was determined .to
assist Stock Exchange borrowers, but cot through
the Issuance of Clearing-nous- rertih>;it?s. A
statement by President Simmons of the Clearing
house that there was nothing in the situation to
exel c alarm and that the banks were abundantly
able- to mcc: any emergency that might arise had
a strengthening influence.
The comparative ease in money not only en
couraged those of a bullish tendency, but led to
considerable covering of short contracts put out
yesterday. A good deal of ihe buvin? for the local
account was sold down to important interests.

turbances in the loan market, were light, but fo.r

DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK, N. V.. Oc:. 30.â R. G. Dun * Co.
will say to-morrow in iheir weekly review of trade:
A market without anything but politics to rule Is
not 'often satisfactory. v Business is almost abol
ished until after -election by the extraordinary
pressure of money, t y the indisposition of anybody ]
to sell who thinks a great change for. the bettir is
near, by the feeling ihat it is ' now of no use to
contract or buy when so little time remains before
h decision, and by the general absorption of busi
ness men in political activities. The indications
show a gratifying confidence in probably better
things, but an enormous volume of contracts and
orders depend upon the election, and while prices
of materials are strong witn heavy speculative
buylnc the absence of demand makes products
gerferal y quiet .In price, though with evident ex
pec;ation of strength. * "â¢â  ..
The feature of the week has been the preV&Une"-
in the New York money market in spite of the
heaver arr.va of gold. . Qaotatio is of call Qansai
100 per cent or mor â  have no real meaning, except
with practical:y four holidays to come In succ's
siou there is really no market. Commercial loans |
are aim a It. si art. exrej.t is banks sustain their
rcirnhir customers, which they 410 generally with a
fair degree of I berj.llty. The hoarding and en
g*gement of 1 old to provide against contingencies 1
have far surpassed a. l rec irds, and in exebanze
bought ulaai. cold actual y withdrawn, and
contracts to cell vergoUl if required, prouably ex
ceeds in amount $100,000,000.
. The niiik< :s of ciyi tracts to deliver gold on de
mand have jm'r'ortcd ovrr $10.0U0 OUO, it Is be
llev;^fi v Â«in"d' ordered 5,000,000 more this ween.*
These withdrawals of go d from banks for tem
porary deposit elsewhere or by country banks at
" ihe demand tif customers, have been quit"; heavy
and the 1 uylng of foreign exchange has made the
market entirely abnormal and quite out or relation
to the exiuing stale of foreign trade. ' The railroad
earnings in October have been 5.7 percent less than
last year. ".':-. :.~. t '..;.;.
â¢â  Wheat has declined sharply, but U rising again,
closing at IV-jC lower fur the week. Heavy real z
ingunspot sales; extreme monetary pressure in
carrying supples and. belief of foreigners that
they can get what they want at lower prices by
present abstention have materially heiped* the
powerful Chicago influence which jias In bored to
depress ir.ces. , But the evidence ; of great de
mand Ã¼b.oad grows clearer and while Western
receipts are heavy, 7,562,927 bushels for the
week and 756 844 for the past tour weeks
a.u:iis; 31,150,964 last year, the enormous mill
ing returns are of especial value, showing that
toreign orders are preparing a great quantity of
flour for export. . .
These returns not heretofore given elsewhere
will be especially ins:ructlve whenever the mar
let turns on foreign demand. : Atlantic exports
for four weeKg, flour included, have been 8.026.
-558 busbels. against 6.255,412 las. year.' Higher
price* ana actual fain nein parts of India have a
speculative bearing, but are really less impor.ant
to the American murkt t than the news of the de
creasing supplies from Russia.' .*
Cotton has held up remarkably well, in spite of
trade estimates' that the yield 'will be CiO^e to
9.00.J.000 bill's. The trade believes such estl
niatt-s errone.us, and auto believes that present
prices will not oe found too high If with such a 1
no* there should be gojd business in this and j
other countries- ;
Tne- mills are selling staple go ds somewhat j
freely and print cloths are a shade higher, but I
there Is neither much selling nor much effort, to |
buy goo Is or other.UescriptiOus. . The speculation
ill wool continues and has continued during the
past four weeks, 28,321,100 pounds against 29,
-.88,850 last year. â¢ â 
Iron has been bought lr rgely by speculators, 25,
-000 tons of bessemer at PittsliurK raising the price I
to $11 9J. large quantities of gray fcrÂ«e raising
the price to $10 40 and 20,0 J0 tors, nearly all 01
the iron at Chicago. ' â .
Finished produce do no' figure in 1 prices, al
though quotation* are less shaded than of late to
secuie tineas and there Is a si rong^ belief that
alter a week there will be a marked change. â :.Â«
hall ores for the week have been 270 In the
United States, against 278 l<ut year; and 40 in
Canada, agaius; 53 last yeÂ»r.

OF A TAX LEVY
Mayor Davie Declares He
Will Veto the New
Measure.
Speaks of a Plan by Which
Political Enemies Tried to
Insult Him.
NO DESIRE FOR DISCUSSION.
He Is Not Responsible for th â¢ Eighth-
Street Bridge and Is Anxious to
Have It Repaired.
Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway,, Oct. 30. J
Already four months of the fiscal year
liave passed and the City Council has not
yet fixed a tax levy. The time na9 long
since passed when taxpayers have been
accustomed to receive their bills, and
the Auditor's office is being swarmed
daily by people who cannot understand
the cause for such delay.
Next Wednesday evening the City Coun
cil will meet and will, without doubt, pass
a evy of ?1 10, being in excess of a dollar,
ihe Mayor will veto it and the whole busi
ness will have to be gone over again.
Mayor Davie declares that the experience
of the past year has proved the sufficiency
of a dollar, and that he will in no case
attach his signature for an order calling
for a larger sum.
Now that the heat of the animosity
shown towar.i Mr. Davie by a majority of
the Council has subsided, the fact is being
brought prominently forward that the
Mayor was subjected to an indignity last
â week, such as is without precedent in the
peculiar bistory of Oakland's municipal
government. The Council, at a previous
meeting, passed a resolution unanimously
inviting tlie Mayor to attend a conference
of a committee of the whole for the pur
pose of discussing the needs of the city
during the present fiscal year and of at
tempting to arrive at an amicable agree
ment on which 10 base the tax levy.
"Previous to the meeting," Mayor
Davie said to-day, "I was informed that
the purpose of the so-called conference
was to openly insult the chief official of
the city. I was in my office and went to
the Council chaaiber. where I saw a
crowded lobby or people, whom I suppose
had gathered there for the puniose of
hearing a businesslike discussion. Instead
of any decent presentation of facts or ar
guments in favor of a high levy President
Mott produced two long typewritten
speeches lull of misstatements and insult
ing language, intended to be sarcastic,
the whole expressive of personal vindict
lveuess. It was, of course, his intention
that I should sit there while he read for
his own edification these prepared
speechesâ prepared by I don't know whom,
but can guess â and hear myself openly
insulted by the highest official in the Coun
cil. In view of the fact that I had been
invited to what I supposed .vu to
be a gentlemanly discussion I cannot con
ceive of a greater insult, and on all hands
I hear remarks deprecatory of such con
duct.
. "One of the most stupid remarks ever
made by Mr. Mott is in re ard to the
Eighth-street bridge. He infers that lam
responsible for its present deplorable con
dition. If he wore nonest, he wouid ad
mit that I have not and never did uave
power to do anything to that bridge. Let
the Council pass an ordinance making an
adequate appropriation for placing the
bridge in a stable condition, and see if I
will veto it. Until they place the power
in my hand-, I can do nothing, and any
insinuation to the contrary is simply play
ing to the gallery, which Mr. Mott has
practiced until he has reached the point of
perfection. I shall certainly veto the levy
which will be passed next Wednesday,
and I do not think there will be enough
votes to pass it over my veto. All kinds
of ordinances appropriating money for
various purposes have already been made,
and will have to be met through the in
come raised by the tax-levy yet to be fixed.
I cotitend ihat it was very unbusinesslike
fora City Council to plan heavy snd un
necessary expenditures until they find out
how much money they will have to spend.''
BASSETT HIS "RESIGNED"
His Action, Though Useless* Has
Added Strength to the Re
publican Nominee.
The Congressional Ticket Does Not
Contain His Namâ A One-lUus*
frate.-Artice Campaign.
Oakland Office San Fraxcisco Call.)
908 Broadway, Oct. 30. f
J. M. Bassett, who never was a candi
date for Consres3, startled the public to
day by announcing his "'resignation" in
favor of Warren B. Englisi;. Wnat Mr.
iiassett has resigned flora and what Mr.
English will gain are points that an intel
ligent public would like to have answered.
About three months ago a long illus
trated article appeared 'announcing that
Mr. Bassett would make a buckboard cam
paign in the Third Congressional District
on a strictly anti-railroÂ»d platform. It is
not known when his campaign com
menced or if it commenced at all,
but it is known that for several months
liis n. me has never been mentioned and
nothing has been hearu of his buckboard.
It is rather interesting at this time to
hear of his "resigning" iw favor of Mr.
BnclUh.
-Mr. Bussett mn-t be familial with tlie
events of the campaign in which Mr. Hil
born was counted out by the influence of
the railroad company. He is surely
aware who supplied that midnight loco
motive that flew to Altamont while decent
pÂ»ople were in their beds, and at whose
bi iiliug many of the farmers and voters
of Altamont were dug out of their beds to
sign affidavits which they afterward
caitn <i they did not understand, and
whicb in several instances were retracted,
for the purpose of placing evidence before
a Democratic Congress in favor of Mr.
English. Mr. Bassett must also know
that this work was not done by anti-rail
rocd men. He is also aware that if ever
the railroad directly procured the election
of a man to Congress that man was War
ren B. English.
Bit Jims aiways been believed up to date
that Mr. Basseti (who is known as "Old
Para"') has bot-n sincere in his utterances
Â» ainst Hie railroad since he left its cm
â li y. But in view of the latest develop-
W""uts, Mr. BasseU's former supporters

Th o question is also being asked why
Mr. cassett should aye wasted his time

M. iJassett is not to be found on them,
consequently it is but one of the flimsiest
of subterfuges for him to try and correct
the impression that he das magnani
mously stepped down and out in favor or
his railroad friend.
DEATH OF A MINER.
One of the Original Owners of the Com-
wtock I'assex Away.
OAKLAND, Cal.. Oct. 30.â Tbe death
this morning of T. Brodigan, at the i ome
of his daughter, Mrs. E. B. Sanborn,
Fruitvale, removes one of the oldest min
ing men of the State. He was one of the
original owners of the famous Comstock
lode, and was well known t' roughout the
State and coast. About ten years ago be
was injured by being thrown from a
horse, ana since that time he has been
gradually failing, deatn oeing due to a
general breaking down of his system.
Mr. Brodigan came to this coast in 1850
and settled m San Francisco. Later he
went to Tuolumne County, conducting a
hotel and starting the first stage line in
that vicinity. He went to Nevada in 1859
and purchased the whole of Gold Hill for
about $500. He iurnished the greater
part of the capital for tne development of
ti e Comstock lode Â»vhen it was discov
ered, and was one of the largest owners in
the mines. The late James G. Fair, the
multi-milaonaire, wa3 in his employ at
one time.
When Bodie was in its incipiency he
developed a water supply to work the
Standard and Bodie mines and received
$1 a barrel. His income at one time was
$1500 a month, but some vn profitable in
vestments reduced this greatly. He came
down from Nevada for his health about
four months ago.
Besides Mrs. Sanborn the deceased
leaves three other daughtersâ Mrs. Ju ige
Farley of Tacoma, Wash., Mrs. J. E. Hart
of Bodie and Mrs. M. J. Wood of Haw
thorne, Nev. â and two sons, T. J. and
George Francis Brodigan, both of Haw-

A Pioneer's Death.
NILES, Cal., Oct. 30.â James Shinn,

Several of Mr. Shinn's sons and daugh
ters have become very prominent in a
literary or scientific way. Charles H.

magazine articles and has also issued one
or more volumes on Calitornia history, is
now the director of agricultural exper
ment stations in connection with the

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
9JB Broadway, Oct 30. f
The preparations for tbe celebration of
"Tom Reed" day are engaging the atten
tion of thousands of Republicans in this
county. The thousands of yellow baages
on the streets is such a definite demon
stration of strength that tho allied parties
are desperate and are also wearing the
yellow badz^s to destroy, if that were yot
sible, the effect of the McKinley regalia.
It is a repetition of the friÂ«ht of the San
Francisco Democracy over the proposi
tion of the Republicans to hoist their flags
on Saturday.
The County Central Committee passed
the following last night:
Whereas. Thomas B. Reed, Speaker of the
National Hou-e of Reuresentatives, will ad
dress tin- rieoiile of this county on the after-
Doon of November 2, 1890; and whereas, ho
is, by reason of liis great db:iity and long ex
perience in National leg slation, peculiarly
titled to (li-cuss the financial questions in
volved in this campaign; and whereas, Mr.
Reed is admitte lly one of the foremost advo
cates of sound mÂ«ney principles in this or any
other country. We therefore believe that in
thi* "campaign of education" all persons, irre
spective of party affiliations, should have an
opportunity given them of hearing one of the
greatest statesmen of America upon matters of
the most vital importance; therefore, be it
Hetol'-ed, That it is the senso of this commit
tee, and this committee therefore respectfully
requests, that all employers of Jabor in Ala
meda County, without regard to party, give
next Monday afternoon, November 2, to their
emp oyes as a half holiday, for the purposes
above iuaicated. And we further recommend
that the high schoois of the county and eiehih
and ninth grades of the grammar schools be
granted a half holiday.
Messrs. Mortimer Smith, J. F. Farnum,
J. N. Bonham, P. M. Fisher and Guy c!
Earl, representing the Second Ward, have
issued the following:
By special invitation of the National Re
publican Leaeue of Alameda County all rnom

NUMEROUS ADDRESSES.
Professors Griggs and Bailey Before
the leachers.
OAKLAND, Cal, Oct. 30.â The last day
of the Alameda County Teachers' Insti
tute was marked by an increased interest
among the teachers and six addresses
each by Professor "E. H. Griggs of Stan
ford and Professor Bailey of Berkeley.
The more they were heard the more
they were wanted, until the closine hour,
when the gymnasium was crowded to its
utmost capacity. .
The institute adjourned this afternoon
after the most successful gathering that
has ever been held. Professor Grigga, in
his address on "The Use of Literature In
the Reading of History," said :
It was the aim of science to reduce facts to
laws and laws to law. It is hard to obtain a
valuing sense of tne past. Travel is desirable
on this account, for it makes the past alive. In
the varied and diversified interests of human
life it is difficult to come to a valuing sense of
the past. Literature is a tremendous help to
realize history. It is a concrete expression of
human experience. It is the output of life
through individuals. True, the experience is
tinged with ihe writer's personality.
Novelty is not originality. Originality is the
power to assimilate all knowledge and express
thoughts gained from this assimilation. Ex
amples of this form of originality are Dante
and Goethe. Understand the moving forces of
history. This understanding of forces is the
concrete realization of the past. Literature is
not so much the embodiment of outer life as
the life of the soul. The world after all re
duces itself back to individuals. Literature is
the expression of the soul rather than the
body of life. Understand the importance of
religion, moral and ascetic causes of history.
Literature is the ideal rather than the expres
sion of passing events.

COONEY NOW SUES
CHARLES L FAIR
Big Damages Demanded for
the Allegation of
Forgery.
The Notary Characterizes It as
Wanton and Ma
licious.
ANSWER TO THB CROSS-SUIT.
Fair Said to Be Wrong About the
Date of His Father's
Death.
Delmas & Shortridge, as counsel for J.
J. Cooney, yesterday be^an suit against
Charles L. Fair, claiming $100,000 dama
ges for malicious libel.
It is another suit growing out of the
Fair will litigation. Cooney is the notary
before whom James G. Fair is said to have
acknowledged the famous deeds of gift of
the Mission and Sansome-street proper
ties to Mrs. Nettie R. Craven.
In his answer and cross-complaint filed
on Thursday Otiarles L. Fair declared this
certificate to be a forgery, declaring that
the certificate was given by Cooney after
he had left office and after tbe death of
James G. Fair and at the instance of Net
tie R. Craven.
The exact wording is as follows:
That the said certificate of acknowledg
ment thereon was not and is not genuine, and
was and is false, forged and counterfeit, and
was made, lorged and counterfeited and at
tached to said document by said J. J. Cooney
after tbe death of said James Q. Fair, and
alter the said J. J. Cocuey had resigned as and
after he hnd ceas :d to be a notary.
The said document and purported deed of
gift was made, uttered and lorged by said
Nettie K. Craven, and ihe said purported cer
tificate of acknowledgment was made and
forged by said J. J. Cooney at the request of
Eaid plaintiff, Nettie R. Craven.
In the suit begun the circumstances are
recited of how Fair came before him
(Cooney) in person and certified to the
deeds. The language quoted from the
cross-complaint is characterized as a
"malicious and wanton publication," and
damages are demanded, as stated, in the
sum of $100,000.
An answer to the cross-complaint of
Charles L. Fair, begun the day before,
was also tiled yesterday, in whicn specific
denials were made of the points raised.
It was denied among other things "that
James G. Fair died in the City and County
of San Fr:mcisco on the 27th day of De
cember, 1894." On the contrary the plain
tiff avers that James G. Fair died on the
28th of December, 1894.
PLAYING SNAPPY BALL
Berkeley Football Men Spend
a Week of Hard
Training.
Coach Cross Says He Would Give
$500 If He Had Rmsoma at
Palo Alto.
BERKELEY, Cal., Oct. 30.â Without
peradv nture of a doubt, the harde t work
of the present season by the Berkeley
football men has been done within the
last four days. They have been working
like Trojans. Their plays have been so
hard and swift that they may be said to
nave even verged on recklessness. Every
thing has been favorable for brisk, snappy
work. The recent rains left the ground in
good condition, especially the turf just off
the main field. Each aiiernoon during
the week the sky has been overcast with
clouds and a sharp breeze has blown in
from the bay rendering the air cool and
crisp. The men being in good physical
condition, the ground soft and tho atmos
phere favorable, they worked with unpre
cedented zeal.
Bulterworth introduced a novel feature
Wednesday which proved to be very bene
fial. He had the men play on a slight in
cline, giving the hill to the second eleven.
This tended to average things up consid
erably, and the result was that the second
eleven, wh eh was on the lower side, had
to work like timers.
Two nÂ«-w men who give promise of de
veloping into crack players came out dur
ing the week. They are Mclsaacs of the
Law Colleee, who was fo r merly tackle on
the Olympic team, and Barnes of Santa
: Cruz, a i andidate for center or guard, who
; weighs 193 stipixnl.
The te;>m w 11 have their next game on
' election day with tlv Olympics at Central
Park. They are in much better condition
! than when they met the Oaklanders the
j last time, and are in strong h ->nes of sc >r-
I ln <>a victory on next Tuesday and thus
offset the defeat whicu taey met in the
lust game.
Coach Cross of Stanford wns on the field
during practic-- this iiftsrnoon, when he
took nn oiÂ»t) ortunity of sizing up the men
and U*e plays.
In commenting on the last Berkeley-
Reliance snme Cross staled through The
call that be was disappointed iv Ran
aome, but when he saw the bit: U. C. cap
tain go down the field t is afternoon,
knocking tacklers right and left, he was
heard to say: "I would give $500 if wo had
Ronsome down at Palo Alto."

Mrs. C. O'Connor, wife of Cornelius
O'Connor, died yesterday evening at her
home, 825 O'Farrell street, in this City.
Her health had been failing for some time

RACEGOERS LIKE
HAWAIIAN MUSIC
The Dusky Islanders At
tract Much Attention
at Ingleside.
When the Barrier Was Raised
Freeman Failed to Get
Ruinart Away.
LIBERTINE THEN WON HANDILY
Mamia Scott Beaten Through Poor
Jockeyshipâ Lucille First at Very
Cem for table Olds.
The dusfcy Hawaiian Islanders who fur
nish the music at Ingleside track attracted
almost as much attention yesterday as did
the horses. It appeared to be "vocal day"
with the members of the Royal Hawaiian
band, and their sweet voices charmed all
in tbe rendition of their native songs.
The weather was perfect for racinp- pur
poses and the track was good, although
not fast. However, as election day draws
iiiph a slight iailing-off in the attendance
is perceptible.
Again were some decidedly well-played
favorites knocked down. Mimic Scott
looked a "lead-pipe" for the opening
event, but C Slocum furnished a sort of
ahnost-any-piace-will-do ride ami she fin
ished second. Of tne other choices, Sepoy
and Libertine only were successful.
In tne final race of the day, a mile-purse
event. Libertine and the crack three-year
old Ruinart were to meet, and the crowd
expected to see a horserace, but were, to
an extent, disappointed. Tlie closing bet
ting was all in favor of Libertine, who was
held at 3 to 5. Although by no means
neglected, the odds against the three
year-old drifted back Irom 11 to sto 3.
Tbe other starters were Sir Play and
Ws worn a.
When the barrier was lifted Patsy Free
man aboard Ruinart must have been in a
trance, for the other three starters were
ail of forty yards ahead of his mount be
fore he seemed to realize that lie too was
supposed to go. L'.bertine led throughout,
and although Sir Play had him straight
over a furlong from the stand, he won
handily at the wire by a length and a half
in 1:44%, with Sir Play secoiia. Freeman
on the second choice chased the Luneti in,
rinishing last, but close up. Well away at
;he start, Ruinart would have won.
Considered a moral and well played at
odds of 3 to 5 in the opening six-furlong
dash Mamie Scott was pooriy ridden, fin
ishing second to Spry Lark, an 8 to 1 shot,
ridden by Tommy Butler to the best ad
van :age.
Sepoy. a brown colt by Hindoo, carry
ing "Curly Shields' coiors, led almost
from start to finish in the live-furlong
scramble for maiden two-year-olds, beat
ing Vino two lengths. Cogent was a fair
third. The winner was a2to _ favorite in
the betting.
A. B. Spreckels, president of the Ingle
eide Association, scored his iir?t win at
the meeting with the St. Saviour filly, Lu
cille, in the third event, ove r six furlongs.
She went to the pos-t Wilb ti to 1 about her,
Â» rid coming away from the tieJG easily at
the end won by three lengths from Circe.
Encino, the 2 to 1 choice, ran a very poor
race, finishing next to the last horse.
It appears that Lou Lou II can run in
s!u*h, but not on a good track. Mr.
Sinks' mare opened a 2 to 5 favorite in the
ring for the h've-funong skip that was
'.ourth on the card, reached io v to 5 and
finished third, never being able to get to
the front. Backed down irom Bto 4W tol
Grandezia was out in front ail the way,
and won a3 she pleased from Aiazan, a5O
to 1 shot. The favorite was ridden by
Henry Shields, the ex-cdaÂ»upiou of the
Australian barrier.

Notes.
The Pacific Coast Jockey Club has de
cided to hold no racing on election day.
The judges suspended C. Slocum for bis
poor ride on Mamie Scott, 'pending fur
ther investigation. â  It is said scmo inter
esting developments may result from the
race. '
Captain P.ees questioned Owner Sam
Ilildreth for a plausible reason a*? to why
Shie.'ds rinds it so difficult to get .short
priced horses away from the post. The
explanation was apparently satisfactory,
although followers of the "dope" cannot
figure it out.

BOUGHT A GOLD MINE,
Hugh McDonnell and James
Dalies Get the Compromise
for $50,000
Will Put Oa a P. ant of Machinery
and Work the Mine With a
Gocd Force of Men.
Hugh McDonnell, the noted mining
operator, who, with James Sallee, not
long since sold the Iron Mountain mino
in Shasta County to English and New
York capitalists, has bought the Com
promise gold mine, near Tehachapi, for
f')O,OCO. Mr. McDonnell is now at the
Palace. He cave to a Call representative
tLe details of the purchase.
The mine was bought of S. N. Wight of
this City, who had a bond on it from W.
C. Carmichel, J. W. Ahem and Frank
Carniichel. the owners. Mr. Ahem is an
attorney in Baker^field, and the Car
ruichels live in Ventura County.
"The Compromise mine is four miles
southwest of Tehachapi station, in the
TehachaDi Mountains," said Mr. Mc-
Donnell. "It is in an out-of-ihe-way
place, but the best thing I have seen in
many a day. I hunted'all last year to
lind a mine as good that could be had
and couldn't rind one.
"We bought it after we had been on the
ground two hour-* and before we had had
any assays or mill runs. We simply tested
it there by oreaning some of the rock ami
panning it. It is a rich property, 'lhe
owners have been averting $11 a ton
working by arastras, and ?4 a ton was lost
by the crude process. There are about 200
tons of ore out now at the mine, and about
1400 tons blocked out.
"The property is worked by three in
clines and numerous crosscuts to a depth
of 120 feet. Paying ere is found ten leet
lroin the surface.
"We have already sent down a Hunting
ton mill, crusher and other machinery
atid Mr. Sallee is on the ground to super
intend the work. The mill will be work
ing by December 1. when twenty-rive men
will be employed. Meanwhile we will only
employ about ten men.
'â¢The country is very rich about there.
The altitude is about 4000 feet. The moun
tains are not rugged, but rolling. Snow
falls a foot and a half deep in winter and
the thermometer jtoes 2 or 3 degrees below
zero. It is a splendid place in summer.
There is plenty of wood and water enough
tor ordinary use and steam purposes."
Mr. McDonnell will be here for several
days before returning to the mine.

FRANK W. CUSHMAN of the State of Washington, the Abe Lincoln of the Northwes
Mr. Cushman, a tail, slab-side, crooked
shouidered young man, with a clear voice
and the most awkward of gestures, but
full of animal magnetism, kept his hearers
spellbound for two hours last night.
Sam Booth and an excellent quartet
furnished vo cal music to the delight of
their hearers, who encored again and
again.
Among the citizens on the platform were
Charles F. Crocker and E. F. Preston. H.
N. Clement presided over the meeting and
introduced Judge A. Van R. Paterson as
the first speaker.
Judge Paterson was warmly greeted
with a round of long-continued applause
and began by saying that it was about
seventeen years since he had attempted
to make a political speech. He had been
content to remain silent and vote, be
lieving that the newly elected Presi
dent and his Cabinet would discharge
their duties with patriotism and
fidelity to the constitution, confi
dent that no lasting injury would
be done to tbe country, no matter who
might be elected. But in this present
conflict he saw that something was press
ing against' the framework of tbe State
and that there was imminent danger to
Republican institutions. It was the duty
of his hearers next Tuesday to avert that
danger, and he added significantly: "It
will be averted. The only thing left to do
is to see with how great emphasis it shall
be averted."
The speaker spoke of the ascendancy of |
American women in this campaign, and
said that it would be but h very short time
before all the members of all the political
parties would be falling over one another
to ask favors of American womanhood at
the polls.
He believed in the necessity for the com
pletion of ihe Nicaragua canal, in reci
procity and other issues that are going

As a lawyer he would say that the de-
I nunctation in the Democratic platform of
I the President for calling out the Federal
j troops to save life and property was one
i of the most radical and revolutionary ut
terances made since ISOI.
There vas another declaration in the
Democratic platform â a contemptible
Russian anarchistic attack upon the high
est tribunal in the Nation.
Mr. Cushn.an, on being introduced to
the audience, was presented by Theodore
Reichert with a bouquet of golden chrys
anthemums in his most graceful manner.
If Mr. Cushmau had been a lady Mr.
Reichert could not have made the pre
sentation more gracefully.
Mr. Cushman gained the good will and
sympathy of his hearers in his first few
I sentences, and held them well in hand
j until the close. He thanked the ladies
i who had assembled to hear him, and said
j that the time was 6oon coming when
j women would have an equal voice and
I vote in the affairs of the Nation, and he
added that he could not see that there
was any difference between the refined
bruin of a woman and that of a man.
On the subiect of the denunciation of
' the Supreme Court by the National Demo
cratic Convention he said:
"If the Supreme Court of the United
States is to be criticized I want that criti
cism to emanate from a man who stands
before the country with his honor unim
peaclied, and not from the man who par
doned and let out of the Illinois peniten
tiary anarchists whose hands were reeking
ied with the blood of American citizens."
In a relerence to Bryan Mr. Cushmnn
described him as "this new Democratic
soap-bubble filled with Nebraska wind,"
and he raised a shout of laughter when
lie said that during the four years of Har-
I rison's administration tbe people were so
busy making money that they didn't nave j
time to think, but now the people lial ',
more time than anything else.
Not one of the silver orators had at
tempted to explain how this free a Iver
was to get into circulation. He told a
fanny story of n Democrat who asked him
whether he wouid have to go down to the
Sub-Treasury for his free silver or whether
it would be sent up to him. The speaker
informed tbe anxious Democrat that if he
would send his address to Congressman
Maguire that gentleman would send him
his free silver and would pay the express
charges on it.
It seemed to have escaped the memory
of the silver orators that this country has
been under the gold standard for many
years, and that it was always prosperous
under Republican administration. Not
the free coinage of silver is wanted, but
the free coinage of American labor into
American products to be >old in Ameri
can markets to American men and women.
Auother reference to Bryan exhibited
the quaint diction of the speaker. In say
ing that be formerly lived in Nebraska
and knew Mr. Bryan be said: "I knew
him as well as if I had went through him
with a lantern."
He followed with an anecdote of a
Democrat who listened to one of Congress
man Bryan's speeches in 1890 and said
that he wanted a change.
When the speaker saw him after the
change had taken place tbe poor man told
bim that he bad worn his old pants so
threadbare that he had become ashamed
of and had turned them inside out and
was wearing them .that way. Mr. Cush
man predicted that if the Democratic
party were allowed to continue in its own
sweet way the poor man would have no
breeches at all.
On the subject of free coinage Mr. Cush
man said that there is not. never was and I
never would be a free-coinage coin worth j
more than the bullion in it. He asked
how it was that when the law fixed the
ratio of gold and silver coins the gold and
silver dollars separated from that value â
from 15 to 1t032t0 1. A coin cannot rise
above its bullion value in the markets of
the world.
Mr. Cushman told of a letter he hadre
ceived from Fred Grant, son of Ulysses S.
<irant, in which he said his father had
always taken the stand that it was a great
misfortune for any nation to have for its
coinage basts any metal about which
there might be the least element of un
certainty.
"When the laboring man shall receive a
Bryan dollar for a dollar's worth of labor
he will receive 53 cents and will trust in
God for the remaining 47 cents. There
never was a time since Noah left the ark
when human labor was paid higher than
it was in the United States when Harri
son was President," were sentences which
evoked enthusiastic applause.
The audience was thrown into merri
ment by Mr. Cushman's reference to Mr.
Bryan's declaration that free coinage
would cause the value of the gold dollar
to fall, and in the same speech that it
would make the silver dollar as good as
tbe gold dollar.
"Why, my friends, 1 ' added the sneaker,
"the man who made that statement was
so crooked that he couldn't walk about
the block without meeting himself on the
the other side."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 31, 1896.
FINAL RALLY OF
THE DEMOCRATS
Flow of Free-Silver Elo
quence in the Pavilion
Last Night.
Governor Budd Enveloped in the
Folds of a Falling
Flag.
A VERY DRAMATIC INCIDENT.
Some One Loosened the Halliards and
the Star-Spangled Banner
Fluttered Down.
Thousands of flags waved in the |MeÂ»
chanics' Pavilion last night and great
enthusiasm prevailed, for the forces of
Bryan nnd free silver were gathered for
the j urpose of making a demonstration
tiiat they considered worthy of the close
of the campaigr.
Marching columns of Iroquois braves,
the Bryan Free Silver Flambeau Club, tbe
uniformed Democratic clubs of AJameda
County and other organizations began to
arrive at 8 o'clock, and half an hour later
all the seats of the vast edifice were"filled,
only a small space of Handing room re
maining unoccupied in the western end of
the hall.
By request of the committee of arrange
ment? the American flag was adopted as
the emblem for the occasion, and, as small
oopies of the National ensign were fur
nished free to all who entered the hall,
there was no lack of color in the assem
blage.
In order to draw as big a crowd as pos
sible a long list of speakers had been an
nounced, the following-named gentlemen
being included: Governor James H. Budd,
Senator Stephen M. White, Congressman
James G. Maguire, J. J. Dwyer, Frank H.
Gould, W. W. Foote, Thomas V. Cator,
Thomas J. Clunie, Henry C. Gesford. M.
F. Taylor, Charles D. Lane. W. H. Alford,
Jefferson G. Chandler, M. F. Tarpey, E.
M. Wardall, Governor R. B. Smith and
George W. Baker.
A majority of these gentlemen took
seats on the platform, which had been
raised near the south side of tbe hall for
the accommodation of the orators. A
number of other prominent Democrats
and silver advocates were also present.
At 8:30 o'clock W. H. Alvord, chairmen
of the Democratic campaign committee,
attempted to call the meeting to order,
but was liitprrupted by the entry of half
a dozen marching clubs and bands that
had not been included in the official pro
gramme.
There was so much enthusiastic cheer
ing that it was 9 o'clock before Mr. Al
vord again thought it worth while to try
to obtuin order.
Mr. Alford said that he had never be
fore seen a Democratic meeting that was
big enough to suit him, but at last his
ambition in this regard was gratified.
He said:
"We have been called anarchists be
cause we criticized t:ie Supreme Court.
To that we reply that couns are subject
to criticism the same as any other thing
or person in this world, and we draw
their attention to the fact that many of
tbe atrocious crimes of tho centuries have
been committed by tne sanction of courts.
The crucifixion of Christ was authorized
by a court. The beheading of St. John
was ordered by a court; witches were
burned in England and America by order
ot courts; Robert, Emmet, the matchless
Irish patriot, was executed by order of n
court. Those courts and all other courts
that sanction an invasion of the rights of
the people are justly subject to the criti
cism'of honest men.
When Governor Budd was announced
lie was greeted with genuine enthusiasm;
the band played "Hail to the Chief," ana
tbe little flags were vigorously waved to
and fro.
The Governor was in good voice, but
there was so much commotion in tne
hnll that he could not be heard except by
those in the immediate vicinity of the
rostrum.
Tom Reed's name opened Governor
Budd's remarks. He said:
Tom Reed hns said that it did not require
the shout of a Bryau man because you could
tell him by his face. That is a fact, because
on the face of that man there is found honesty
of purpose and stamped there more than all
independence of action, that dearest right of
an American citizen, independent of thÂ« dic
tates of corporations to go into the voting
booth and then, in the eye of his God, to cast
his ballot, for the man of his choice, according
to the dictates of his heart.
The Governor bad begun to speak in
protest against tbe action of Mark Hanna
in attempting, as he thought, to monopol
ize the star-spangled banner and to estab
lish a flag day for the Republican party in
this country, when some one loosened the
immense flag that stretched across the
hall over the speaker's head and it fell
down enveloping the Governor and for a
moment hiding him from tbe audience.
In an instant the Governor shouted that
the cutting of the flag rope was a Republi
can trick, but almost immediately he re
considered that opinion, and said it must
have been an unintentional act of some
person who acted as ar. instrument in the
hands of the Almighty, who thus mani
fested his approval of this meeting by
graciously crowning it with the star
spangled banner, so dear to the hearts of
all.
When the flag first fluttered down from
the upper air a cry went uu to lynch the
person who cut the halliards, but Governor
.Budd quieted the crowd by saying that
while the Republican leaders might try to
monopolize the National ensign, he was
sure that there was not a man in the
country so dastardly 83 to voluntarily put
a knife to the flag "of his country. [Ap
plause.]
After paying a tribute to the Populists
and tho Silver Republicans, who had
come forward in what he claimed was a
spirit of true patriotism to support the
champion of the people, Governor Bndd
proposed three cheers for William Jen
nings Bryan, who, in his opinion, would
be the next President of the United States.
The cheers were given, followed by the
usual "tiger."
Charles D. Lane, the wealthy goid
miner of Angels Camp, the "angel" ot the
Bryan campaign in California, was intro
duced as one ot the stanchest silver advo
cates of the Pacific Coast. Mr. Lane de
clared that, in his opinion, the true sys
tem of "sound money" is the bimetallic
system advocated by those who are sud
porting Mr. Bryan. He introduced Judge
James G. Maguire, who was greeted with
the greatest enthusiasm. He declared
that the Democratic party stands for the
rights of the people, for equal opportuni
ties for all, special privileges for none,
and that W. J. Bryan is ihe personal rep
resentative of these sentiments in the
present campaign.
Judge Maguire spoke for several min
utes on the silver question, and when the
audience called out for him to "go on" he
excused himself on the ground mat there
were others to speak and he must save his
voice in order to argue again 3t Mr. Hunt
ington's funding bill that is soon to come
up in Congress.
Thomas V. Cator attempted to speak,
but his remarks did not attract much at
tention, his voice being almpst entirely
drowned by the shouts and outcries of the
crowd.
Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt made a spir
ited appeal to the Democrats to support
the sixth constitutional amendment, and
give the women a chance to vote. She de
manded it aa the right of the womanhood
of tbe country. Her remarks were well,
received.
Hon. J. J. Dwyer, member of the Dem
ocratic National Committee, was the next
speaker. He began by protesting against
what he declared was the effort of
"Emperor Mark Hanna" to monopolize
the American flag on the 31st of October.
He said that he feared that the Republi
cans would try to bribe voters and would
endeavor to make a dishonest count ot the
ballots. Democrats were called on to be
watchful and to frustrate the efforts of
their opponents.
George W. Baker of the California Bi
metallic League raised a laugh by saying
that judging by the meeting before him
the adherents of Mr. Bryan would be all
right on election da}', and would defeat
their opponents at me ratio of about 16
tol.
He declared that he baa just received a
telegram Jroin Los Angeies saying that
7000 silver Republicans hud been enrolled
in that city under a pledge to vote for
Mr. Bryan despite the mighty efforts of
Czar Reed, who had come all the way
across the continent to le^ll the people of
California how to vote.
M. F. Tar; ey, when introduced, said
that he had "been asked, Where is Tom
Reed? He said be didn't know, and tie
thought if Mr. Reed hBd obtained a vision
of this meeting before coming to thiscoast
it would have required a search warrant to
rind him. [Laughter.]
Mr. Tarpey then grew very serious as
he pictured the awful consequences that
wouid follow if the single go>d standard
should be saddled upon this country by
those bold, bad men, the Republicans. In
conclusion he warned Bryan Democrats
aeainst voting for the nominees of the so
called National Democratic party.
E. M. Wardall, chairman of the Popu
list State Committee, spoke briefly pledg
ing the support of the People's party to
the joint electoral ticket agreed on by the
friends of Bryan and silver.
Henr.v C. Gesfora maile * brief speech,
after which G. W. Baker proposed three
cheers for Charles D. Lane, who, he said,
had supplied the sinews of war for the
silver campaign in this State, thus, in Mr.
Baker's opinion, to n certain extent stand
ing off the sack of Mark Hanna.
The cheers of gratitude were rendered
to Mr. Lane, and with thrta more for Mr.
Bryan the meeting adjourned.

SYMPHONY CONCERT.
A Fashionable Audience Listens to
Strains of Sweet Music.
The Baldwin Theater was comfortably
filled yesterday alternoon with a matinee
audience, composed chiefly of ladies, who
had been attracted by the second concert
of the Hinnchs-Beel aeries.
The orchestra had been somewhat
strengthened since the opening concert of
the series a r fortnight since, ihe strings
were firmer and the brass and reeds did
better work. This was especially noticea
ble in the symphony, which was played in
a smooth and" finished manner through
out. The "Seiefried" music wps alao per
formed with a keen appreciation of its
beauties, and so was the music from tiairt-
Saens' "Henry VIII."
Sigmund Beel played Max Bruch's G
minor concerto for violin and orchestra
brilliantly and was enthnsiastically ap
plauded. SiÃtior Abramoff also sang with
splendid effect, liy the way, it is now
stated that before definitely settling In

take a twelve-weeks' engagement to sing
with the Metrooolitan Opera Company.

TOLD OF DEATH
IN A DREAM
Strange Incident Connected
With a Gas Asphyxia
tion Case.
Miss Jennie Ward Appeared to
Her Friend and Bade
Her Goodly.
NOT DISCOVERED IN TIME.
Mrs. Cecelia Slow of Turk Street
Heard the Woman Moan and
She Called in Help.
Jennie Ward, a domestic living at 216
Turk street, was sent to the Receiving
Hospital early yesterday morning suffer
ing from gas asphyxiation. The physi
cians said the case would probably prove
fatal.
From all appearances it was a case of ac
cident, for there is no reason given fdr the
young woman desiring to end her life.
She went to bed about 10 o'clock the night
before in good spirits. Although out of
employment Miss Ward could always find
a ho-pe with her uncle and aunt, who are
well to do.
Associated with the asphyxiation is a
feature of a psychological nature. It was
presented by tbe statement of Mrs. Cecelia
Slow, who lives in tho same house with
Miss Ward and with whom she was on
very friendly terms. Mrs. Slow's state
ment was as follows:
"Mrs. Maggie Hahn, Miss Ward and I
had been together in my room during the
preceding evening," said she, "and at 10
o'clock Jennie said she was going to bed.
Mrs. Hahn was staying witn me, as my
husband is out of town. About 5 o'clock
this morning 1 awoke from a horrible
dream, which caused me to arouse Mrs.
Hahn.
" 'Something is the matter with Jennie,'
I said to Mrs. Hahn, "for I dreamed of
her."
"I dreamed that Jennie came into our
room and, placing her bands on Mrs.
11 aim's head and on mine, said: 'Good- by,
Cecelia, eood-by, Maggie; the time has
come for me to part with you. 1 Aa she
spoke she changed her hand from my
head and placed it over my heart, wblch
caused me such a feeling of oppression and
suffocation tut I could not breathe, ana
that was what woke me. I knew that
something was the matter with Jennie."
"'You have had a nightmare; go to
sleep,' said Mrs. Hahn. I could not sleep,
and the dream made such an impression
upon me that I determined to see if Jen
nie was all right. When I reached her
door I heard her groaning, and I could
smell the gas that escaped from the key
hole.
"I knocked on the door and called her
name, Dut she did not answer, so I went
to the landlady and we entered the room
through tbe window of an adjoining room,
and we found Jennie almost dead. The
gasjet was turned only half way round.
Jennie was very absent-minded, and I
believe she must have got up to light tbe
gas and failing to find a match went back
to bed and forgot that the gas was on. I
don't believe in dreams, but this was a
strange one, for it took me to Jennie's
bedside when her life was in great
danger."
The statement made by Mrs. Blow was
fully substantiated by Mrs. Hahn, who is
much impressed by the coincidence, if
such it can be called.
At a late hour last night Miss Ward was
sti.l alive, but with little hopes for her
recovery.
WILL GET ELECTION MEWS
The Press Club to Be Connected
by a Special Wire on
November 3.
Communicatkn Afforded With Great
Leaders â Western Union's
New Departure.
On Tuesday next, owing to the great in
terest in the pending National election the
Press Club will be connected by a special
wire and will have an instrument and
skillful operator in the rooms.
The news will be bulletined as fast as it
is received. It is expected there will be a
big crowd there all night, as the member
ship is large, and nearly everybody has a
special and in many cases personal in
terest in the outcome.
Manager W. J. Martin of the Western
Union Company learning that the club
desired to get tbe dispatches generously
offered to connect the rooms and put in an
operator without any cost whatever. It is
expected that it will be a eala night.
Probably the rooms will be rilled to their
utmost capacity.
The service will be so good that direct
connections con be had with Chicago,
Canton, New York, Lincoln and other
cities, and with great men of the parties.
â¢'The Western Union Company will do
differently this year from what it ever did
before," said Manager Martin last nigat.
"It will not depend on any of the news as
sociations for any of its reports, except in
San Francisco. It will have a service of
its own, collecting the news lor the as
sociations themselves. Elaborate prepara
tions have been made all over the United
States.
"By 12 o'clock on Tuesday night it will
undoubtedly be known who is elecied.
Minor details about tbe tickets in different
States will follow.
"We will also, as we go along, give com
parative votes. For instance, with the
Presidential vote will be given the vote for
Harrison and Cleveland in 1892 in different
districts and States.
"Thus it may beseenataglancewhether
the Presidential candidate is gaining or
losing. The figures of the last National
contest are already in every one of our
offices, to be used on the instant."

the greatest loss. Fire Marshal Towe
placed the damage at $10,000, while the
contents â coffee, spices and chocolate â are
said to be damaged to the extent of $50,000.
The loss on the Sansome-street siae will
probably reach $2000, due principally to
water.
Just how the fire originated no one
seems to know positively. It was first
discovered in the rear of the Jackson-street
building, and is believed to have been
caused by burning coffee in the rear
roasting-room. The first alarm was turned
in at 2:50 a. m. from box 18. Two other
alarms followed shortly after, and in a few
minutes the entire Fire Department was
on the scene. ThÂ«y worked nard and fast
until 8:45 a. m., when the flames were
finally extinguished.
WORK FOR WORDEN.
The San Francisco fcabor Council Will
Adopt Active Measures Next
Thursday Evening.
The San Francisco Labor Council met
last night at 1159 Mission street. In the
absence of President Burns Andrew Furu
seth occupied the chair.
A communication was received from the
Sheet and Piate Glaziers' Union, asking
that efforts be made to form such a union
in this City, as the intent is to make such
organization National. The matter was
referred to the organizing committee.
Several communications were received
from candidates for office, but on account
of their length were simply placed on file.
Some of the delegates made vigorous ob
jection to the reception of the communica
tions on the ground that tne Labor Coun
cil is not a political body.
It was decided that the committee on
the case of S. D. Worden, sentenced to
capital punishment for train-wrecking,
should meet next Thuasdny evening at
7:30 o'clock. It is. probable that active
measures tending to a commutation of
Worden's sentence to life imprisonment
will then be taken.
