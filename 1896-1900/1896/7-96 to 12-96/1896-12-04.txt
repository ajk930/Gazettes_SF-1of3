SHARKEY'S HURTS REPORTED
NOT TO BE SEVERE
A Majority of Sporting Men Still Believe That
Fitzsimmons Was Robbed of the Decision
and the Purse â Lyneh's
* Statement
Tbe lovers of fistic sport who sat about
the ring at Mechanics' Pavilion Wednes
day night and saw Bob Fitzsimmons put
Tom Sharkey to sleep do not and will
never believe that the Cornish man fouled
the sailor, and moreover, the majority of
them are outspoken in their belief that
Bob was robbed.
Toe fight and its sudden and unsatisfac
tory termination were the talk of the town
yesterday and the peculiar train of events
That led up to the fight and what followed
it rrmrÂ» t*anÂ» over on. Â»vary street corner
and in every cafe.
The sports recalled the declaration of
Marvin Julian that the referee was fixed
Tom Williams Said There Was
Â'" No Foul.
'â¢ for Sharkey, Earp's peculiar action in not
defending himself before the assembled
throng and the fact that he was relieved
of a gun in the arena.
Then they told each other how foul
Eharkey had fought and of Earp's ap
parent indifference to the sailor's tactics.
Then Earp's sudden and precipitate dis
appearance from the ring were commented
on and inferences drawfc from that.
An incident that caused a great deal of
talk was the refusal of the trainers and
backers of Sharkey to allow the doctors to
â¢cc the sailor. W hen Sharkey was carried
out of the rine beseemed in a complete
state of collapse and totally unable to
walk. This, ring-goers think, was the
time for a physician to be called. Yet,
when Dr. Lustig, Dr. O'Brien, Dr. Kot
tanzi and others offered to attend him
they were shut out of his dressing-room
and r.o physician saw him until a man
named Lee, an irregular practitioner, with
whom the police are well acquainted, was
called and with no one but Snarkey's peo
ple present at the examination pronounced
him seriously injured.
His statement is heavily discounted in
view of the subsequent reports of reputa
ble physicians, made yesterday, that
Sharkey's injuries are far from being se
vere enough to incapacitate him from hav
ing gone on with the mill. So long a time
had expired that it was hard to tell when
Â«Â» how the hurts were received.
Gibb and Groom, managers of
i^K. National Club, are coming in for no
â¢Aall amount of unfavorable comment for
not withdrawing Earp as referee when
Julian objected to him. Julian was will
= ing to accept any one in the house outside
of the bad man from Arizona.
An easy and honorable solution of the
matter would have been to withdraw Earp, ,
The San Francisco Call.
which the management had a perfect right
to do, and turn the selection of the referee
over to Sharkey and Lynch.
In this issue will be found the opinions
of a large number of prominent citizens
on the subject of that decision.
GIBBS' EXPLANATION.
The Managrer Tells Why Wyatt
Earp Was Selected as Referee.
Manager Gibbs oi the National Clnb
"tated to a rapreser. tc-ivtf of Tffr
how he happened to select Earp to decide
a question involving the payment of
$10,000.
"You understand," said he, "that the
agreement was that in case Sharkey and
Fitzsimmons could not select a referee,
then the club should do so, and as time
p assed and tbev were far away from the
decision we began to ca3t about for a man.
Stepping into the Baldwin one day I saw
Mr. Earp, and I told Mr. Groom, who was
with me, that if we had to find a man,
there was good material.
"I knew that Wyatt Earp was a cool,
clear-headed person of an unimpeachable
reputation, and one who would be per
fectly fair to both fighters. Moreover, he
had refereed about thirty fights and had
the experience necessary for the position.
The only desire of the National Club was
to give Fitzsimmons and Sharkey an
equal chanc* in the ring and for that pur
pose we wanted a just and able referee for
the contest. Neither Mr. Groom nor my
self spoke to Earp regarding the matter
until noon on the day of the fight.
"Sharkey and Fitzsimmons bad failed
to agree upon a referee and the club must
act. Groom and I hunted up Mr. Earp
and informed him that we bad selected
him. "We three sat in a small curtained
apartment in the Baldwin Hotel. Earp
thought over the matter for a few oainutes
and said that if it were agreeable to all
parties concerned he would do his best to
render a fair decision.
"Then we notified Julian and Need ham
and both gentlemen expressed themselves
as perfectly satisfied. We congratulated
ourselves that all these preliminaries had
been settled, but when we got to the ring
last night Julian inlormed us that he ob
jected to the referee. He said he nad been
told that Earp was goin^ to decide in
favor of Sharkey.
s "1 then brought Needdam and Julian
together and said: 'Gentlemen. I haven't
a word more to say in this matter; settle
The Formidable Weapon Taken From Referee Earp at the Fight by the Police. It Is a 45-Caliber Colt's One Foot Long.
it yourselves. Make some choice quickly
so that the contest can begin.'
"After considerable discussion Fitzsim
mons called off the debate and Earp was
permitted to act as referee. I watched his
work and saw that he acted with fairness
and promptness. He stood cose to the
two men and would quick y break them
apart when they clinched. My instructions
to him were to overlook any little unim
portant fouls on thp part of either man
as it was not the wish of the club to stop
the contest on a mere technicality. Mr.
Earp said he would not interfere unless
absolutely obliged to. "
"Do you consider Earp's decision a fair
one?" was asked Manager Gibbs.
"I cannot say whether it was or not, as
I did not see the blow, which he declared
a foul, struck. At that instant 1 was
looking up at the gallery, where the great
crowd was pressing dangerously against
the railing and I was fearful that it would
give away and a dreadful accident occur.
When I looked again toward the ring
Sharkey was lying on the floor.
"I feel keenly this rumor of crooked
refereeine and am more than anxious that
the question may be investigated fully.
The club did aii it could to bring the fight
off fairly and if there is anything wrong
we want to learn that fact.
"This morning at the request of Mr.
Julian I requested the bank to defer the
payment of the check till some amicable
settlement could be brouent about. Both
Sharkey and Fitzsimmons are particular
friends of mine, and personally I did not

have a particle of prefarence for one over
the c t her. I did not wager a cent and had no
other interest in the matter than to have
a square and fair contest, the better man
to win the $10,000 and the public to get
an entertainment for their price of admis
sion."
THE EXAMINATION.
Doctors Report Sharkey's Injuries
to Be Not Severe.
Manager Groom was seen yesterday
afternoon leaving the Chronicle office with
a sack which contained in gold and cur
rency $5000, the amount of money the
"This is how he did it/* said
Major McLaughlin*
National Club had deposited as a guaran
tee to the pugilists that it would carry out
its part of the programme to the satisfac
tion of the contestants.
When asked if the club intended to en
gage physicians of prominence to examine
the maimed pugilist, Groom immediately
answered in the affirmative.
"Yes, oy all means," he said. "I want
reputable physicians to examine Sharkey
to-day in order that their testimony may
clear the club of any cloud of suspicion
that may be hanging over it in reference
to this unfortunate affair. There will be
a meeting for that purpose at 4 p. m. this
evening at the Windsor Hotel/
ABked if the ciub would have any objec
tlon to The Call being represented by a
physician at the examination, Mr. Groom
replied that he would be only too pleased
if all the papers were represented by
medical men.
It was 4:30 p. m. when the following
physicians met at the Windsor Hotel
solely for the purpose of ascertaining the
extent of Sharkey's injuries and if they
were caused by a blow: Drs. Joseph
Pescia, J. S. Barrett. D. F. Ragan, T. A.
Rottanzi, Charles Shilling, Winslow An
derson and D. D. Luatig.
Doctor Ragau was the attending physi
cian in behalf of Dan Lynch, who is'Shar
key's manager. He was first to examine
the fighter and turninz to Doctor Lustig
said in undertones that there was no
doubt as to Sharkey's injuries.
The latter physician was next to ex
amine the champion of the navy. He
soon discovered that the injury to Shark
ey's groin v. as not as bad as reports stated,
and so informed Dr. Ragan.
"Yes," said Dr. Ra^an, ''that may be:
but if you look into his eyes you will
notice that they are affected by the in
jury.
â¢'Oh, nonsense!" was the quiet rejoin
der of Dr. Lustig. "What on earth have
the eyes to do with this case?" The physi
cians then had a happy exenange of
words in reference to the question at issue
when Dr. Ragan put a sudden stop to
the exchange by informing Dr. Lustig
that they would postpone further argu
ment on this matter until after the physi
cians in attendance had had an opportu
nity to fojrm an opinion.
In connection with the examination of
Sharkey there was an episode of unusual
intere-t. The physicians having retired
for consultation and having returned with
a brief, non-committal report replete with
technical words, each medico affixed his
signature to it. As the last one was about
to sign the document be observed the name
of one Lee attached to it He inquired as
to who the gentleman was, ana no one
knew him.
It happened that Lee was the man who
attended Sharkey immediately after the
alleged injury was received, to the exclu
sion of everybody else.
As he is not a physician regularly regis
tered and in standing the six physicians
withdrew their signatures and signed an
other report, upon which Lee's name does
not appear.
Stripped of its modical verbiage this re
port shows that Bharkey's injuries are not
severe and bears out the statement made
by Dr. Lustig in another portion of this
issue that Sharkey's hurts were not seri
ous and not sufficient to incapacitate him
from continuing the fight.
-Â»
DR. LUSTIG TALKS.
The Club's Physician Was Refused
Admission to Sharkey's
Room.
Dr. D. D. Lustig, the physician regularly
attached to the National Athletic Club,
was >ne of the very first men to go to Shar
key's relief when it waa announced that
he was injured. With him were Drs.
Rethers, O'Brien and Roltanzi. They
applied for admission into Sharkey's quar
ters and they received a point blank re
lusal.
"This refusal I consider as inexcus
able," asserted Dr. Lustig yesterday after
noon, subsequent to the regular examina
tion conducted by the corps of physicians.
"If Sharkey were injured in the way as
was .claimed he was in need of immediate
attention.
"Our examination to-day, sixteen hours
after the injury is supposed to have been
suffered, is ratb.ur tardy and unsatisfac
tory. All we can say at best is that there
is an injury â that's all. Whether the
harm is an hour or seventy-two hours old
cannot be determined.
"I do not believe that a man with the
injury presented now by Sharkey would
be incapacitated from continuing in the
fight. Perhaps the injury was much
greater last night, but we have no means
of ascertaining that, and our report is
based simply upon present appearances
without saying when the injury was in
flicted."
Stripped of its medical verbiage, the re
port of the doctors was that Sharkey was
not hurt so badly as to incapacitate him
from fighting.
INJUNCTION GRANTED.
Fltz Brings Suit to Recover the
Purse for the Ble Fight.
Robert Fitzsimmons, the Cornish prize
fighter, yesterday began a suit in the Su
perior Court to obtain possession of the
slo,ooo purse offered the National Athletic
Ciub and which was by Referee Wyatt
Earp awarded to Thomas Sharkey last
Wednesday night, alleging that Fitzsirn
mons delivered a foul blow in the boxing
match then going on.
The action is directed against the Anglo-
Californian Bank.which issued thecertified
check for $10,000, Thomas Sharkey, John
Doe and Richard Roe.
After alleging that boxing matches are
allowed in San Francisco by virtue of an
ordinance enacted by the Board of Super
visors and that the National Athletic
Club had been granted a permit to hold
exhibitions, the paper oeinc signed by
Mayor Sutro, and that the license required
by law had been paid for conducting the
contest on Wednesday evening, Fitzsim
sons goes direct to the point of the quarrel
and charges corruption, collusion and
fraud on the part of Sharkey, the Na tional
Athletic Club and Wyatt Earp, referee
and final stakeholder in the fijiht, their
purpose being alleced to be to swindle
FitzÃimmori3 out of the prize, no .matter
which way the tide of battie turned in the
roped arena.
Fitzsimmons recounts the circumstances
of the making of the match, whereby it
was agreed that the prize should be
awarded to the contestant who displayed
the greatest skill in training and boxing,
and that he expected to have the matter
decided on those lines. Id this expecta
tion he declares that he was sorely disap
pointed, for he avers that a corrupt under
standing and conspiracy existed betwee
the National Athletic Club, Siarkey and
Earp, whereby SfJarkey was to receive the
money under any and all circumstances.
To confirm this position Fitzsimmons
alleges that tbe parties so conspiring re
fused to agree with him in regard to the
choice of a referee, so that by the terms of
the match the club had tbe privilege of
choosing ths referee at the ringside, The
choice of E.irp, Fitzsimmons says, was in
conformity with the conspiracy, and that
his decision awarding the' money to
Sharkey was its consummation.
Touching the outcome and actual re
sult of the fight, the plaintiff avers "that
he discomfited the said defendant Shar
key so that said defendant was unable to
furiber proceed with said boxing and
"It's a fraud," said Mose Gunst.
sparrine exhibition," which is the polite
way chosen by Fiizsimmons for saying
that he knocked out Sharkey.
Fitzsimmons concludes by asking that
the bank be restrained from paying the
check, that Sharkey and his agents be
prevented from collecting it and that the
check be ordered into court. After that
the court is asked to adjudge that; Fitz
simmons is the winner of the fight and
consequently is the lawful owner of the
money and that the $10,000 check be de
livered to nira and his iawvers forthwith.
The certified check, over which the
wrangle is raging, reads as follqws:

The Superior Court granted a temporary
injunction yesterday afternoon restrain
ing ihe Anglo-California Bank from pay
ing over the $10,000 until the case is de
cided.
Colonel KowalÃky did not know last
night when the case would come up, but
said that the other side had ten days to
answer and that the matter would be
heard within a few days.
EARP ARRESTED.
The Referee Charged With Carry-
Ing a Concealed Weapon.
Captain Wittman, in handing tbe
revolver to Chief Crowley yesterday morn
ing, did so in the hope that Earp would
call for it before noon, when he would be
promptly arrested.
As he failed to show up the Captain de
tailed four of his men to search for him,
while be personally spent tbe afternoon
doing the same thin?, but without success.
Policeman Frank W. Riley was detailed
to watch the Pud restaurant on Stockton
street, near O'Farrell, where Earp takes
his meals. Between 6 and 7 o'clock last
yening Earp entered tne restaurant and
Riley went up to him, telling him that
Captain Wittman wanted to see him at
tbe Central police station.
Earp accompanied the officer and when
they reached the central station the cap
tain asked him where he had been, as he
had been looking for him all day.
"1 have been out at the races since
moruing, " replied Earp, "as there is so
much talk in town about my decision
that I wanted to get away from it."
The captain then informed him that be
was under arrest for carrying a concealed
weapon, and he escorted him to the City
Prison, where the charge was booked
against him. Earp put up $50 cash bail
and then took his departure, saying that
he would be in court this morning.
The revolver i- wbat is known as the
''frontier Colt's," 45-caliber, single action,
about twelve inches long, with eight-inch
barrel. It nas a round barrel and square
cut-off handle.
EARP'S PISTOL.
Why the Referee Was Not Put
Under Arrest at the Pavllon.
â¢'Why was Wyatt Earp not arrested last
night for carrying a concealed weapon?"
was asked Chief Crowley yesterday after
noon.
"It would have been a very impolitic
action," replied the Chief, "to arrest him
in the presence of 12,000 spectators. They
would have said that the police were try
ing to stop the fight for a very trivial
reason.
"He banded the revolver to Captain
Wittman when asked to do so, and it is
my belief that no judge nor jury would
convict him in the circumstances.
U I have the revolver in my possession,
but Mr. Earp has not called for it. I don't
exactly know what I will do when he calls
for it. I would hate to have . to be com
pelled to return it to him."
"Has Earp a permit to carry a re
volver?"
"I don't know, but whether he has or
not, it was a most extraordinary proceed
ing for him to have the revolver in his
pocket when he entered the prize-ring."
An examination of the records failed to
show that Earp has a permit, at least his
name was not on the register.
EARP AND LYNCH.
Associates In the Running: of Horses
at the Racetrack.
Martin Julian, at the Baldwin Hotel,
reiterated the statements he has made
and which were published yesterday morn
'jjifeot that hiÂ» brother-in-law,
Robert Ifsusimmons, was robbed of the
$10,000 purse.
"We will not give up without a fight."
he asserted, "and our attorney has en
joined the money from being paid over to
SharEey. Through Commissioner Gunst
and others I learned yesterday that Wyatt
Earp was fixed to give the fight to Sharkey.
His conversation with Joe Harvey and
the subsequent flood of money put up on
Sharkey when before that "no Snarfcey
money was to be found, indicated there
was something wrong.
"I have ascertained that Wyatt Earp,
the referee, is closely allied to Dan Lyncn,
the representative and backer of Sharkey,
in their racehorse business. That being
the case, it would have been a right and
proper thing for Earn to have refused to
officiate as referee even if I had not ob*
jected to him as I aid publicly before the
battle."
DR. LEE'S CAREER.
An Illegal Practitioner and Ar
rested for Negotiating Stolen
Bonds.
B. 6. Lee, the man who was called in
to attend Sharkey after he got his knock
out blow, is, according to the police, an
illegal practitioner.
â  Lee is the man who was arrested about
the beginning of this year on suspicion of
being implicated in the robbery of a num
ber of Kansas City bonds from a safe
deposit box in a bank in Kansas City, Mo.
Lee had no connection with the actual
robbery, but he was arrested while tryiug
to negotiate one of the stolen bonds valued
at $1000 with the Market-street Bank,
Spreckels building.
R. L. Loughridge was some hours later
arrested as one of t!ie three men who
robbed the bank. Loughridge had some
friends in this City and he came here
with his share of the stolen bonds.
Loughridge was taken back to Kansas

PLUNGED FROM A
DIZZY HEIGHT
An Airship Lying Help
less on the Twin
Peaks.
IT LANDED SUDDENLY
IN A DITCH.
Two Men Come to Grief in
a Forty- Foot Mys
tery.
IT IS BUN BY GAS AND ELEC-
TEICITY.
Speculation as to Where It Cams
Fromâ The Owners Very
Reticent.
An airship built of galvanized sheet
steel, forty feet lone, caused much excite
ment among the -people on the Mission
hills last evening. They saw it sail over the
Twin Peaks and then getting out of order
in some way it made a wild plunge into a
pulch 200 yards south of the Corbett road,
near what is known as Stanford Heights.
Its two occupants were turned out of
the cockpit in which they stood and
landed badly bruised in the bottom of the
gulch.
When seen late at night by two Call
reporters the huge metal affair presented
a pitiable appearance.
The propeller was twisted and bent; one
elevating fan was ripped off and lay on the
ground, while the other was badly twisted
from the force of the shock.
A large hole in its side permitted the
escape of a sickish smelling gas. The
steering aparatus, rudder as it was called,
which had been on the bow was also
broken off.
As stated, the machine was about forty
feet lone 'and was of cylindrical shape,
with both ends cone-shaped.
Near by stood one of the bold, but un
lucky aeronauts, J. D. de Gear of 538 Ful
ton street.
He looked woefully at the wreck, and
thanked his lucky stars that he was still
alive. The other man, the inventor, had
disappeared as soon as he found that no
Ixm'*!s wArebrokea.
Dr. Gear positively refused to reveal the
name 'of the inventoj.
Dr. Gear upon being pressed told in sub
stance the following story of the airship
and the accident :
"I am a tin-roofer and metal-worker,
and the inventor who has the money is a
well-educated man. Some time ago we
decided to build an airship, and we built
this one in the Mission. We put it to
gether up the hill back of here in a clump
o! trees.
"This was our first attempt to make a
flight. The hydrogen gas used is made
from muriatic acid, and the fans and pro
pellers are operated by electricity.
"This evening the inventor and I started
out from the hill up yonder to see bow it
would work, but after we got started we
failed to rise over ten feet from the
ground, as the metal of the fans was too
thin for the work they had to do.
"In a short time we saw we haa trouble
abead, for we lost control of it and away
we went.
"I can't describe the sensation better
than to say it was a feeling similar to that
one has when he had a nightmare and
dreams that he is falling.
"You see we started high up the hill so
our downward flight was very long, or so
it seemed to us. But we were in for it and
did not have very long to wait.
"When we struck we struck hard in the
soft ground, and the force of our flight
carried us over and into the gulch, where
we were thrown to the button of the
ditch.
"No, I will not tell who the inventor is
nor where it was built. We are not dis
couraged, for we know we can fly when
this is perfected. It needs strengthening."
"Is this one of the %hips seen over the
City with electric lignts, etc.?" was asked.
"No, it is not. We don't know any of
the people connected with the airships
the papers have mentioned.
"This is a private enterprise. D the
luck," and he scraped a chunk of mud off
his coat.
The first news of the unfortunate airship
was obtained from Emile H. Laplace who
has a milk ranch on ifae Corbett road
about -200 yards from where the airshio
1 cÂ«. In h s words he said:
"I was about to go to bed when I heard
ahâ of a noise down the pasture. It2
sounded like a collision of trains loaded
with coal-oil cans.
"A second later I heard two voices down
the gulch crying 'Help, help!' I went
down there with the lantern and found
this affair."
Mr. Laplace says that the ship could not
have been built near this place for there
are no trees there to conceal it and he
knew every inch of the country therea
bouts.
He is sure that the airship came from a
distance, but how far he is unable to say.
He says that as soon as the inventor
learned that ha was about to telephone to
town from the Almshouse, be skipped
out lor the city, but not before
the two had stripped the
wrecked vessel of all the electric ap
pliances and storage batteries, so as to
prevent curious outsiders from getting an
idea of the theory aud principles they are
working on.
The machine adheres, in a manner, to
.the usual cigar shape, [t is about forty
feet in lengtn and is built of galvanized
sheet steel.
The main bodjror hull of the contriv
ance is cylindrical in shape, tf-n feet in
diameter and twenty feel in length.
Attached with rivets and thoroughly
soldered to the body are two metal cones
each ten feet in length.
Two eight-bladed fans, each a few inches
over six feet in diameter, are located "on
top of tbe body, and are evidently capa
ble of tremendous speed.
The vessel is fitted with a huge pro
peller, also eight-bladed, which is fur
nished with power from a steel shaft run
ning to the center of the hull.
A similar shaft runs forward and pro
trudes through the end of the front cone,
and to this shaft ihe rudder or steering ;
apparatus is attached.
In the center of the ship lies tbe secret
which its builder refuses to thoroughly
explain â the vessel's motive power.
He acknowledges the power to be an in
tricate electrical apparatus, run by storage
batteries and connected by means of a
worm and cogs to the driving gear.
He also says that tbe storage
batteries are capable of carrying suffi
cient electricity to run incandescent ligtts,
one of which, the aeronaut said, is always
brightly burning when the aerial machine
is in motion.
Buoyancy is produced by gas generated
within the bull by means of muriatic acid
and other chemicals.
Tbe fas has a nauseating odor and
fumes which leave a sweet taste on the
lips and produce drowsiness.
It does not seem to be a common gas.
What its capacity as a lifting gas is, how
ever, another proposition.
It must be unusually great as the air
ship, built of sheet steel, carrying fans, a
propeller, electrical apparatus and two
men, weighs many hundreds of pounds.
The gas produces sufficient buoyancy to
almost lift the ship and its load from the
ground.
Afjer being filled with gas tbe
top fans are revolved at great
speed, and after the machine
is lifted a few feet above the earth the
propeller is bet going and, the navigators
say, the machine sails away.
The machine sailed quite a distance, ac
cording to its builder's testimony, before
it woke the neighborhood with tbe
thunderous rattle of its impromptu land
ing.
It was stripped of all its electrical ap
paratus and the inventor, who risked his
life iv order to perfect the machine,
skipped away in the dark and hid away
his treasured secrets.
A STRANGE VISITOR.
Excitement Caused by the Landing
of a Tin Ship Near the
Almshouse.
Captain Reddy, superintendent of the
Almshouse, reported la3t night that a
man called at his office about 2:30 o'clock
yesterday afternoon and asked for the
telephone number of tbe Chutes. The
number was given and ha called up Mr.
Riley.
In the conversation he said to Riley:
"We will ruak-e a break or make a start
to-night." The man who used the tele
phone gave his name, but Captain Reddy
does not remember it.
Last night a boy came to the Almshouse
very much excited, saying that the air
snip had fallen in a eulch between Sunny
side and the Almshouse.
In an interview Captain Reddy last
night gave this narrative:
"Dr. Coniin and I started for the place
where the slip was reported to be. We
found tbe machine about a mile from tbe
'Almsbouse. It was between thirty and
forty feet long and weighted, I should
think, 250 nounds.
"It was made of common tin, and to it
was attached propeller blades made of the
same material. The man in charge of the
ship said he had started from the hill
above. I examined the machine, and it
looked too heavy and clumsy to fly.
"There was no storage battery visible.
The man said he had a partner who had
taken the machinery out. He said the
lifting power was ga3, but I saw no com
partment or place where sufficient gas
could be stored to lift the ship. I did not
see the ship in the air, although the boy
who gave us the n#ws said he saw it come
down. . '
"I examined the contrivance closely,"
continued Captain Reddy, "and observed
that it had been freshly painted, but the
paint was worn off, indicating that it had
been dragged over tbe ground some dis
tance. The p'opcller was very flimsy,
and seemed as if it could not impart any
force in revolving. The tin of the body of
the ship was dented in places.
"From the story told about the partner
who had removed the machinery, and
from the flimsy appearance of the ma
chine, I came to tbe conclusion that the

BILLY JORDAN'S FORCIBLE OPINION.
BILLY JORDAN, master of ceremoniesâ Did you ever in your life see such a
bold-faced robbery? I was right alongside the ring, where I could see every move,
and I know the blow that is claimed to have been foul landed above Sharkev's
belt.
If he bad been struck where they say ha was he would have doubled up and
fallen forward instead of on his back. Fitz foueut a square, manly fight, and
should have had the decision. Sharkey is as foul a fighter as lives, and 1 have
seen them all.
This thing should be denounced in the public press until all sucn fakers as
ihese are driven out of the business Boxing, when carried on properly,
is the greatest of sports, but such robbery will kill any pastime. I hope the purse
will be withheld until this matter is thoroughly sifted.
WHAT POLICE COMMISSIONER GUNST SAYS OF THE AFFAIR.
Police Commissioner Moses Gunst was one of the men whose opinion of Referee Wyatt Earp caused Martin Julian, as
representative of Fitzsimmons, to declare that Earp was not a desirable man, as he was said to be "fixed ia favor of
Sharkey."
Gunst was unshaken in hia opinion yesterday afternoon when he was seen at his office by a representative of The
Call.
"It was an outrageous steal," the Commissioner said. "FitÂ«Â«mmons was clearly the victor, and be fought as fair a
fight as any man ever witnessed. These two gentlemen (.indicating a couole of Eastern visitors who were in the office)
were with me at dinner yesterday. They were prepared to wasrer $2000 or $3000 each on Fitzsimmons, and I'm happy to
say I prevented them from doing so. While we were dining, a man whose name Ido not care to bring iÂ»to this affair
came to me and asked if I was betting any money on the fight. I answered truthfully that I wa3 not. In return I
inquired the reason for such a question at that time. He answered, 'Nothing, only if you're betting you had better shift
over to the Sharkey end.' I paid little heed to this until another man came to me and the same story was told. Then
again, another man, just as trustworthy as the first two, repeated the warning, and gave the same advice. My eyes began
to open then. '
"My friends, who had been offering to bet $2000 to $600 on Fitzsimmons and who could find no takers, stepped down
the street with me, and all around us we found plenty of Sharkey money at odds of $100 to $65. That was too great a
jump to be honest, and it gave us sufficient corroboration ol the rumors that hud reached us at dinner to risk any money
on the game.
"Then it was that I met Riley Gran nan, the horseman. He said that he had been 'onto' the crooked work hours
before. He bad seen Wyatt Earp in busy conversation with Joe Harvey immediately after Earp's selection as referee.
When Earp and Harvey separated, the latter asked, 'Well, L can depend on that?' Earp answered, 'Yes.' It was bat a
short time after this conversation that tbe Sharkey money began to flow like water.
"After hearing this report I told the whole thing to Hickey, the trainer of Fitzsimmons, and it reached Martin Julian.
Before going to the Pavilion-1 ran into Joe Harvey at the Baldwin, and I talked to him of the impression I had gained. I
said to him: 'Here, Harvey, things do not appear to be right. I'm told tnat this fight is not to be on the square, and if it's
so I want to hear of it positively.' I added: 'You sports are killing sport in this City, and it must be stopped or I will do
everything in my power to prevent professional boxing contests hereafter.' Harvey declared Jbe had nothing more to do
with it than to bet his money on the short end, because he believed it to be a good thing.
"Now, I don't accuse any man of crooked work in this affair, but I insist that the surrounding circumstances look as if
the whole matter had been cut and dried for Sharkey to win and that the sure-thing gamblers did not begin to plunge
until they were positive that the referee was safe. I, Major McLaughlin, Thomas. H. Williams Jr. and 'Dolph Spreckels
have spent thousands of dollars in behalf of boxing contests in this City. We have always labored in behalf of the sport
against hard pressure to help the sport along, but I assure you that such despicable work as I saw done yesterday will
cause me to fight henceforth to prevent any fistic exhibitions.
â¦'Sharkey was knocked out as fairly as any man ever was. He was a whipped man at any and all stages of the right.
He fought in the most outrageously foul manner and there was absolutely nothing torecomm nd the decision given by the
referee. I believe that the least the cluD could do would be to withhold the purse and have the men fight for it again be
fore a non-paying audience. Men 6Uch as Hiram Cook or Lem Fulda, who are above suspicion, should be put in as referee
and the public allowed to see a battle on its merits.
"I'm afraid, however, that the nasty worK of last night has given this City a black eye, from which it will hardly re
cover."

Club Directors Say That the Purse
Will Be Turned Over.
The following communication was re
ceived by The Call last evening:
Editor CaIIâDZAR Sir: We withheld pay
imnt of the 'â¢heck because of expressions of
dissatisfaction on (he Dart of mÂ»ny of tbe
audience. Some of them claimed that the
referee was a party to a job to cheat Fitzsim
mons. In order that Fitzsimmous and his
backers might have every opportunity to in
stitute legal proceedings they threatened after
the contest, we, as directors of the National
Athletic Club, requested the Anglo-Californiau
Bank to withhold payment of the check for
the time being to avoid any possible future
charge on the part of Julian or F.izsimmons
that the money was paid over before they bad
an opportunity to prepare their pleadings.
If a loul blow had been dealt by Fitzsim
mocÃ we knew that an examination by physi
cians would prove it. Being unable to secure
a satisfactory examination Wednesday night,
we thought it advisable to withhold payment
of the check nntil we were satisfied that the
condition ol Sharkey gave corroborative evi
dence of what Kitzsimmons claimed. An ex
amination was held to-day by six physicians,
and we, on their certificate, decided that we
had no right to further delay the payment of
the check. Very respectfully, J. J. Groom,
J. D. Gibbs.
NOT YET PAID.
Lynch Did Not Get the Purse and
Feels Bad About It.
When Dan Lynch, the manager and
confidential adviser of Tom Sharkey, was
asked yesterday if be had drawn down
the $10,000 purse yet he frowned a frown
that vould have caused Wyatt Earp to
feel nshamed of himself.
"Did I draw down the stuff? Wall, I
guess I didn't. Groom and Gibbs headed

"Have you the certificate of deposit in
your possession, Mr. lynch?"
"You bet; I will hold on to it, too. until
i draw down that stuff. Sharkey won the
money and I tbinic it's a shame that the
National Club ordered payment of the
order stopped."
Mr. Lilientbal, the manager of the
Anglo-Cali fornian Bank, appeared very
an^ry when interviewed on the matter.
He said that if he had known the nature
of the deposit he certainly would not have
received it, as he did not desire to be con
nected in any manner with pugilistic
affairs.
"Do you know Mr. Groom, one of the
managers of the National Club?" was
aÂ»ked.
"I do not, air," replied Mr. Lilienthah
sharply.

THE KNOCKOUT BLOW.
Fiztslmmons Explains How It Was
Done at the Bush-S.reet
Theater.
A tolerably good crowd of people was
present in tbe Busb-street Theater laÂ«t
evening to see Bob Fitzsimmons and his
trainer, Dan Hickey, box four rounds.
Fitzsimmons got a very warm reception
when be put in an apparance on the stage.
He said that he was ready to fight any
man on earth from ten rounds to a finish
under a tair and impartial referee, bat
that men he had whipped two or three
times he would not bother with. After
the set-to he gave the audience an idea of
how he stopped Sharkey.
"You see it was this way," said Fitz.
Simmons, as be "squared" before his
trainer. "I caught Sharkey a left hook
in this manner," and he let go at Hickey's
jaw. "Then a right quickly followed, and
as Sharkey was tailing I uppercut him in
the stomach. He fell and reported to an
old dodge, in the hope of getting a de
cision on a foul, which, as you ail know,
he did."
VARIOUS COMMENTS.
What Those Who Saw, Say of the
Affair.
V*)LONEL F. 8. CHADBOURNE, Har
bor Commissioner â The decision of the
reieree has thoroughly disgusted me with
pugilistic contests, and I will never go to
another exhibition as long as I live. The
tight was Fitzsimmons' from the call of
time, and the only fault 1 have to find is
that Fitz did not finish his man in the
second round, when be had him at his
mercy.
HOWARD C. HOLMEBâ A fairer ac
count of a tight was never published than
the one given in yesterday's Call. I agree
with your sporting ertitor in every word
he said about Earp. Why, I left the Pa
vilion uliy confident that Fitzsimmons
had won, and was thunderstruck to read
in The Call this morning that Sharkey
had been given the decision. I never saw
a fairer fighter than Fitzsimmons, and
Sharkey fought foul all the way through.
E. G. OSBORNE, proprietor of Ferry
Lunch Roomsâ l was disgusted with the
decision, i was for years a trainer in and
about London and some of the best fight
ers the world has seen were handled by
me. There was no foul blow struck by
Fitzsiraiuons. bharkey wanted to quit
and sought for two rounds a soft place on
which to fall. When Fitzsimmons struck
him in the stomach he doubled up and
then came the crack on the point of the
jaw that laid him out. You can imagine
what I think or the referee's decision
when I tell you that I went to bed certain
that Fitzsimmons had won.
C. 8. CATHCART, the amateur light
weight â You want to know my opinion of
the decision and the referee? Supposing
you were the referee, and say I got up and
denounced you before 10,000 people as
having been bought in the interests of one
of the contestants, would you have re
mained in that ring twenty seconds? Bah !
A team of bullocks couldn t have kept you
in the inclosure. Sharkey is a wonder
fully improved fighter, but he is a dub in
the bands of a man like Fitzsimmons.
Fitzsimmons was simply robbed.
SERGEANT AVON of the Harbor Po
liceâl was within fifteen feet of the fight
ers when the alleged foul occurred. I had
to do a great deal of climbing in order to
get to my seat But when I got there I
had one of the best seats in the Pavilion.
Sbarkey fought foul from the start and
Fitzsimmons never struck a foul blow
during the contest. Sharkey was knocked
out lair and square, and if me referee says
it was a foul blow I differ with him. I had
not a cent on tbe fight, but. nevertheless,
fair play is bonny play and Fitzsimmons
should have got tue decision.
E. B. bUTTON, purser of the Oceanic
Steamship Company's Alameda â I am
disgusted with the decision. I was watch
ing tbe men closely, and I think Fitzsim
mons struck Sharkey in the pit of the
stomach and then uppercut him. I could
hardly believe my senses when told that
tbe decision had been given to Sharkey
on a foul. All the foul fighting done
throughout the eight rounds was done by
Sharkey. Take ray word for it. Sharkey
will never dare to face Fitzsimmons again.
HARRY MAYNARDâ It was a rob
bery. A bloody outrage on tbe public.
It was hard fighting all through, but if I
had been referee I would have given the
fight to Fitz just as soon as Sharkey
grabbed him by the legs. He did this to
avoid punishment and I would have eiven
Fitz the fight on a foul. In the last round
Fitz was drawing Sharkey out by driving
his left for Snarkey's head and making
him duck, and then he swung tiis right to
uppercut him. It was as clean a knockout
as I ever saw in the ring and I think by
tbe way it turned out that the public was
just robbed by that ref< ree.
J. W- KERRâ Julian's objections to
Earp were such that he should have
stepped out ana let some other man ref
eree the fight. His subsequent actions. In
con junction with the way he hung about
the ring during the wrangle, showed con
clusively thaf something vaa wrong.
Fitzsimmons was certainly entitled to the
decision. The resu t makes it appear that
he was robbed. Any way, Fitzsimmons
has vindicated his claim to be considered
the greatest fighter in the ring.
JULIAN SONNTAGâ I think Fitzsim
mons should have had the decision be
yond a doubt. He is, in nÂ»y opinion, the
most wonderful fighter that ever entered
the ring. If be ever comes into contact
with Jim Corbett he will certainly defeat
him. This decision is certainly going to
hurt ail manly boxing contests in this
Citf , and that can be depended upon.
CLEMENT BENNETT, official stenogra
pher of the FeÂ«lera. courts â Ea p's decision
in the Sharkey-Fitzsinirnons right nas the
rankest I ever heard and deserves to be
shown up to its full extent. It is just
such affairs as that that kills legitimate
sport. Fitzsimmons was entitled to the
victory and purse. Why, Bharkey was
not in'it.
THOMAS H. WILLIAMS JR., well
known horseman â I was not over twelve
ieet from the ring and in a position where
I could not fail to see every blow struck
in the eighth round. I saw tnat Sharkey
was hit clean and clear blows, and the one
particular punch that whipped him was a
clean uppercut that fetched up right on
the pit of bis stomach. lam very much
astonished at Earp's decision. It was un
fair, and a grave injustice to Fitzsim
monn."
JOSEPH D. GRANTâ The Call was
the only newspaper that had the nerve to
come out squareiy and denounce the de
cision as it deserved to be denounced. The
ruling at the pavilion was the rawest
work <.f the kind ever tolerated.
WILLIAM GREER HARRISON, who
is an acknowledged authority on boxing â
I had a good view of the fight and from
where I sat I did not see Fitzsimmons
strike a foul blow. Fitzsimmons, as I saw
him, fought fairly throughout. I never
saw a man nnutn t with more fairness than
he fought, and you can say that Fitzsim
mons according to my observation, did
not foul S ark#y.
LOUIS JACOBS, Deputy Treasurerâ lt
was the worst, decision I e?ersaw. Sharkey
was not in it from the start and it looked to
me that when he saw he was
gone he made a punch in the stomach
an excuse for claiming a foul. Sbarkey
is the foulest fighter I ever saw and he was
beaten by a better and fairer man. Why
that club should have kept Earp in tbe
ring after his honesty had been ques
tioned passes my comprehension. This
means tbe death of boxing contests in San
Franci^ro.
BOSTON. Mass., Dec. 3.â John L. Sulli
van sympathizes with Fitzsimmons and
admires bharkey. To-nk-ht, In discussing
the fight, he said: "I am sorry that Fitz
was so unfortunate to lose the fight on a
foul. 1 do not understand how he
came to foul, as I had always understood
him to be the cleanest of fighters and had
never before beard of his fouling anybody
or using unfair tactics. As I read the re
ports of the fight he had everything his
own way, had no occasion for dirty work
and f-hould have won the fight. However,
the only thing he can do in tbe case is to
abide the decision and seek another fight.
GANS AND ROCHETTE.
Sacramento Men Dissatisfied With
R ferso Earp's Decision.
"Young Mitchell," acting for the New
Occidental Club, matched Joe Gans of
Chicago and Charley Rochette to fignt ten
rounds at Woodwards Pavilion on De
cember 14 last evening. At tbe same time
Jack Ward of New Jersey and Jimmy An
thony, tbe champion bantam of Australia,
signed articles to meet at the same time.
Several of tbe leading citizens of Sacra
mento who wtre down to witness the Fitz
simmons-Sharkey contest left for home
ast evening. Among them were: John
Batcher. George Eagan, Frank Ryan, Tom
Fox and Messrs. Lod.e and Desmond.
These gentlemen bad considerable sums
waeared among themselves over the result,
but considered Earp's decis.on as so un
just that the winners refused to accept
any money and declared the bets off.

WESLEN'S STILL HUNT.
Marching About the Island and Dodg
ing jaaeeo.
KEY WEST, Fla., Dec. 3.â Passengers
who arrived from Havana last night re
port that Weyier's campaign in Pinar del
Rio so far is a complete failure, despite
the fact that he has over 60,000 men in the
â¢ province.
When Weyler left Artemisa he formed a
:- r tolumn of 10,000 infantry, 1500 cavalry
and ten pieces of artillery, and marched,
skirting tbe base of the hill on the
southern side, and seeking an opening to
attack Maceo, who is strongly fortified on
top of the bills. It appears that Maceo
has gathered all his forces and is now in
trenched in the hills waiting Weyier's at
tack. There is no truth, it is said, in the
report that Maceo has divided his forces
' into small bands to elude combat, and it is
further declared that it in known on good
authority that Weyler has no intention of
meeting Maceo.
Gomez, with a large force, is reported
steadily advancing west. He is now re
ported in Santa Clara Province, and is said
te be coming with 20,000 men.
There are more shocking details of Lo
pez Coloma's execution. General Marti
nez Campos, it is said, is indignant at the
injustice committed in executing Coiotna.
Campos obtained the Queen's pardon for
him and sent a telegram so advising. The
massage arrived at noon, but reports say
"Weyler pocketed it and ordered the execu-
tion to proceed.
The rebels trapped twenty-four local
. guerrillas near Qnivican recently. All
were killed with machetes. The fact was
never reported by tbe papers.
â¢ It is rumored that Roloff has arrived
with an expedition from Camneche, Mex.
There is great interest in Havana con
cerning President Cleveland's message and
the action of Congress thereon.
SPANISH CABINET COUNCIL,
The Premier Announces That Weyler Is
Pursuing Maceo.
MADRID, Spain, Dec. 3.â The Queen Re
gent presided at a meeting of the Cabinet
council to-day, at which Premier Canovas
del Castillo announced the arrival of Gen-
eral Polaviejo, the new Governor of the
Philippines, at Manila. T.ie Premier also
announced that the insurgent leader,
Maceo, had disappeared from his position
in the Cuban province of Pinar del Rio,
and that the Spanish troops under Gen
eral Weyler were pursuing him.
Tbe contract to construct a new floating
dock at Havana has been given to an
English firm. The doct is to be finished
within eleven months and is to cost Â£119,
-000 sterling.
FIRING HEAR D IN THE HILLS.
Various Speculations a* to Ike Cause and
Weyler' 's Whereabouts.
HAVANA, Cuba. Dec. 3.â Musketry and
cannon firing has been heard in the di
rection of the Gobernadosa Hills, near
Cayajabos, about seven miles northwest
of Artemisa, and in the rear of General
Weyier's forces. As yet no report has
reached here as to the occasion of the
firing, but it is thought that a detachment
of Spanish troops has met a body of insur
gents who are detached from Maceo'?
command.
General Weyier's ignorance of the
of Maceo is remarked upon
here and is giv.ng rise to many rumors.
One report has it that he ib in theÃubi
Hills with a small force, while another re
port states that he has left the province of
Pinar del Rio, having abandoned his men
and crossed the trocha in disguise. All
these reports are based on nothing but
conjectures.
LOYALISTS ARE FEVERISH.
Aetcs of a Decisive liebcll Defeat Anx
iously ; A waited at Hat ana. ?
HAVANA, Cuba, Dec. 3.âThe expecta
tion of loyalists here is at a high >. point;
they wishing to hear of a decisive defeat
of the rebels in the province of - Pinar del
Rio by the troops under command of
Captain-General. Weyler. â â â â  Since v , his ;_ re
turn to the front from Havana, General
Weyler has bad no engagement with the
insurgents. In fact, the Spanish scouts
have not been able to locate the enemy,
and the position is not known of a single
one of the rebel parties. The last report
received here stated that General Weyler
and his forces were encamped near Los
Palacios.
The condition of General Gonzales
Munoz, who recently returned to Havana
suffering with fever, has become worse
and fears are entertained that he will not
recover.
THE CRITICAL SITUATION.
Events of the Greatest Moment Antici
pated by Kvrry One.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 3. âA dispatch
to the Herald from Havana, via Key West,
says:
It is known that General Weyler has
left Palmacios again for the hills, but no
definite report of what he has accom
plished has reached here.
Maceo's forces realize the gravity of the
situation, but still they show no signs of
uneasiness. Tueir confidence in him is
unshaken.
It is believed that Maceo has met an ex
pedition from Campeche, Mexico, at
Punta Barreos, which brought him fresh
stores and an additional supply ;of
dynamite. It is not thought that
Maceo will quit his position, but
will continue to occupy Pinar del Rio, as
any move out of the province would vir
tually be a confession of his defeat. Maceo,
it is supposed, has returned with new sup
plies and is calmly awaiting an assault by
Weyler on his stronghold.
The situation was never more critical
than now, and every one is anticipating
events of importance. All minor engage
ments and the Government reports of vic
tories are lost sight of in tbe anticipation
of greater things.
It is believed here that Gomez is march
ing down from Matanzas Province to
Guinea, in Havana Province, and from
there to Qnivican. He did this once, and
it is admitted that he can do it again
while so many troops > are occupied with
Maceo. His object is to harass the troops
and distract attention from Maceo. * ;
Of course this is the Cuban's side of the
story, and in any case they point out that
Maceo can cross the trocha at any time
he wishes between Managua and tbe sea.
Formerly the swamp could not be crossed,
but now it is said it is strong enough to
bear cavalry.
Cuban General Lacel, in Matanzas,
sends word that he has had notice that
General Gomez is coming and has pre
pared everything for him in the way of
provisions and support. Generals Delgado
and Diaz have been doing mo-t of the ad
vance fighting for Maceo in Pinar del Rio.
It is reported that General Weyler will
issue a decree on Few Year's day calling
out for military service every male Span
ish subject on the island between 18 and
45 years of age. The report is generally
discredited, but it has caused great con
sternation.
LOYALISTS IN A PANIC.
Effect in Havana of the Bombardment
of Guanabueao.
KEY WEST, Fla., Dec. 3.â Advices re
ceived from Havana by the steamer
Olivette state that on Tuesday the van
guard of the army of Gomez camped
near Guanabucao, which is just across the
bay from Havana.
On Wednesday at noon tbe insurgents
began to bombard Guanabucao. Tbe roar
of tbe guns was heard easily in Havana,
and threw the loyalists of the capital into
a panic
Many houses were fired by the shells
from the insurgents' cannon, and the
smoke and flames were visible to tbe peo
ple of Havana. When the Olivette sailed
the bombardment was still in progress,
and it was reported tbat eighty houses
had been wreckfid and twenty-three Span
ish'soldiers killed.
The Spaniards in Havana were greatly
alarmed, as they believed that the bom
bardment of Guanabucao was only pre
liminary to an attack on tbe metropolis.
It is not likely, however, that Gomez will
attack Havana at this time, his purpose
being to make a diversion in favor of
Maceo.
General Gomez, with the main body of
his army, is now in Santa Clara, near the
border of Matanzas province, and is pro
ceeding westward as rapidly as possible.
It is said Gomez has 20,000 men, well
equipptd, and plenty of artiliery.
The attack on Guanabucao was made by
the van of the army of Gomez, which con
sists of cavalry and has four cannon.
PEARS FOR HA VANA.
Recent Events Cause Great Alarm
Among the Populace.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 3.â A special
dispatch to an evening paper gives details
of tbe situation in Cuba that were received
at Key West by mail from Havana. The
dispatch confirms the statement recently
made by the United Associated Presses
that the second trial of tbe Competitor
prisoners bad not taken place and that
only an examination preliminary to the
trial had occurred.
The rebel attack upon the town of
Guanabacoa has caused much excitement
in the capital, tbe people dreading that
the insurgents will fire upon the city
itself. This fear, however, is groundless
as tbe fortifications round about are more
than enough to deter the rebels from at
tacking Havana.
Four hundred and ninety-eight officers
and men, including General Suarez Inclan
and a number of members of his staff, all
of whom are suffering with yellow fever,
smallpox or dysentery, arrived yesterday
at Guayabay, province of Pinar del Rio.
Most of them will be brought to Havana.
It is reported that the typhus fever has
broken out among Weyler'a troops who
are encamped at Los Palacios.
POLITICAL SUSPECTS ARRESTED.
Prominent Reslamts of Cienfuegos
Thrown Into Dungeons.
HAVANA, Cuba, Dec 3.â Dr. Luis Per
nas, Senor Figueroa, a druggist, and sev
eral other well-known residents of Cien
fuegos have been arrested as political
suspects.
General Melguizo and Colonel San
Martin have made extensive reeonnoiter
ing expeditions within the last two days,
in the course of which they met and de
feated several small groups of rebels at
Maranon, Cabalo and other places be.
tween Palacios and Pinar del Rio, killing
thirty insurgents, all of them armed with
machetes.
REBELS RAID A TOWS.
fire a number of Houses, but Are Even

MADRID, Spain, Dec. 3.â A dispatch to
the Imparcialfrom Havana says that at 10
o'clock on Tuesday night a party of 150
insurgents made a raid upon the town of
Guayabacoa, five miles from Havana, and
burned a number of houses, the flames
being plainly visible from Havana. Most
of the inhabitants of the town fled, but a
detachment of Spanish troops met the
rebels in the chief street of the place and
forced them to retire.
Maximo Gomez, the rebel leader, has
entered the district of Las Villas.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL* FRIDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1896.
PROCLAMATION
OF RETALIATION
Germany's Unfriendly Con
duct Provokes the
President,
Vessels Under the Kaiser's Flag
to Pay Duties in Ameri
can Ports.
A Result of German Hostility to the
Shipping and Export Articles
of This Country.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 3.-There
is reason to anticipate a further break in
friendly relations between the United
States and Germany. The President to
day issued the following proclamation of
retaliation for unfriendly acts of the Ger
man Government:
Whereas, By a proclamation of the Presi
dent of tne United States, dated January 26,
1888, upou proof then appearing satisiactory
that no tonnage or lighthouse duties, or any
equivalent tax or tuxes whatever, were im
posed upon American vessels entering the
ports of the empire of Germany, either by the
imperial Government or by the Governments
of the German maritime states, and that ves
sels belonging to the United States of America
and their cargoes were not required in Ger
man ports to pay any fee or duly of any kind
of nature, or any import due, higher or other
than was payable by German vessels or their
cargoes in the United States, the President
did thereby declare and proclaim from
and after date of his proclamation of
January 26, 1858, the suspension of the
collection of the whole of the duty of 6 cents
per ton, not to exceed 30 cents ser ton per
annum, imposed upon vessels entered, in the
ports of the United States from any of the
ports of the empire of Germany by section 2 of
the act of Congress approved June 19. 1886,
entitled "An act to abolish certain fees lor
official services to American vessels and to
amend the laws relating to Shipping
Commissioners, seamen and owners of
vessels and for other purposes," and
whereas, The President did further de
clare and proclaim in his proclamation of
January 26, 1888, that the said suspensions
should continue so long as the reciprocal ex
emption of vessels belonging to citizens
of the United States and their cargoes
should be continued in the said ports of the
empire of Germany and no longer: and
whereas, it now appears upon satisfactory
proof that tonnage or lighthouse dues, or
taxes equivalent thereto, are in fact imposed
upou American vessels and their cargoes en
tered in German ports higher and other than
those imposed upon German vessels or their
cargoes entered in the ports of the United
States, so that the said proclamation of Janu
ary 26, 1888, in Its operation and effect con
travenes the meaning and Intent ol said sec
tion 2 of the act of Congress approved June
19, 1886;
Now therefore I, Grover Cleveland, Presi
dent of the United States of America, by
virtue of the aforesaid section 2 of the act
aforesaid, as well as in pursuance of the
terms of the said proclamation itself, do
hereby- revoke my said proclamation of Janu
ary 26, 1888, suspending the collection of the
whole of the duty of 6 cents per ton, not to
exceed 30 cents per ton per annum (which is
imposed by the atoresaid section oi said act),
upon vessels entered in the ports of the United
States from any of the ports of the German em
pire, the revocation of said proclamation to
take effect on and after the 2d day of January,
1897.
In witness whereof I have hereunto set my
hand and caused the seal of the United States
to be affixed. Geovek Cleveland.
Evidences of an unfriendly disposition
of the German Government toward the
United States have been accumulating
ever since the differential duty on bounty
paid German beet sugar was imposed by
the Wilson tariff law. American cattle
have been excluded on the pretext of dan
ger of contagion from Texas fever, which
cannot exist in northern climates. Ameri
can hoc products have heen excluded, even
though cooked and inclosed in cans, on the
allegation that these cooked products
might contain trichinae, which cannot
exist in cooked food. Discriminating and
prohibitive duties against American oleo
margarine, glucose and petroleum and
many other exports which formerly went
to the German empire have followed one
after the other.
All these matters have been made the
subject of vigorous protest from our Gov
ernment, much of the correspondence
having been conducted by Edwin F. Unl,
now our Embassador in Berlin, while he
was our Assistant Secretary of State.
Mr. Uhl is therefore particularly well quali
fied to deal with the existing situation
should it grow more tense.
OFFICIAL FENONCE.
So Expression of Opinion From the Ger
man Embassy at Washington,
WASHINGTON, D. ' C, : Dec. 3â Mr.
Yon Reichan, the Charge d'Affaires of the
German embassy,, declined to express an
opinion this afternoon when spoken to
regarding the t ' President's proclama
tion. He simply stated that the matter
had been the subject of , correspondence
for some time, but that ,he could i neither
anticipate what action the imperial Gov
ernment would take with reference to the
proclamation, nor did he care to express
an opinion regarding it.
It is not believed that the German Gov
ernment will consent to the imposition of
a discriminating â â  tax on German vessels
without at least a more vigorous protest
than .'has : yet ] been made. ' ThÂ» :' German
contention,' it .is : understood, is that the
| duty complained of 'in the : President's
proclamation is not imposed solely on
American vessels, but upon vessels of all
nationalities, including German vessels. -
The revenues arising from the tax are
not converted into the imperial treasury,
but become the property of the several
States within whose . jurisdiction the tax
is laid and by whom the money is used to
improve their harbors in order to facili
tate the loading and unloading of : vessels.
â¢-â  It is argued that if Germany should re
scind this tax, so far as American vessels
are concerned, it would at once call forth
a protest, not only from the ; English,
French and other European powers whose
vessels would still Ibe subject to taxation,
but from German shippers as well.
Hill Bare a >alutar>j Effect.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 3.âRepre
sentative McCreary of Kentucky, a mem
ber of the Honse Committee on Foreign
Affairs, did not care to discuss the procla
mation, although he admitted that the
subject has been quiatly discussed by
some members of the committee recently.
"It will have a salutary effect," aaid he,
"and should bring an end vo the evils of
which we complain."

ONE LONE HIGHWAYMAN LESS.
Allen Downe, the Denver Terror and a
California Convict, Is Doomed to
the Gallows.
DENVER. Colo., Dec. 3.â The trial of
Allen Downe, the "lone highwayman"
and confessed murderer of Joel G. Ash
worth, a well-known salesman in a prom
inent packing-house in this city, ended
to-day when the jury returned a verdict
of "guilty of murder in the first degree."
About a year ago a lone highwayman
began operating in the suburban districts
of Denver, and his hohl-ups were of such a
darin Â» and reckless character as well as of
such frequent occurrence that he soon had
a large portion of the police force on his
trail, and although he had several encoun
ters with them, in one of which he killed
Chief Russell Shores ana emptied two six
shooters at tne policemen in the buggy, he
managed to elude arrest until two months
ago, when after robbing a man on the
Golden road he was followed at a safe dis
tance by his victim until a farmhouse was
reached, where assistance and firearms
were plentiful, and after a hot chase he was
captured and brought to this city.
Downe appeared much pleased with the
turn his affairs bad taken, and a few days
after bis capture he dumbfounded the
police by making a lengthy 'confession
and stating in detail the circumstances
connected with his various crimes, in
cluding the murder of Ashworth, whose
death he appeared to deplore. His story
was correct in every detait with the police
records, ar.d this tact, urobably more than
his mere confession, induced the jury to
bring in the verdict of guilty.
Since his arrest Downe has insisted that

SWINDLERS IN THE TOILS.
How Two Clever Rascals Fooled 80,000
Persons With a Word-Contest
Bicycle Scheme.
CHICAGO. 111., Dec. 3.-Wiiliam S.
Thompson and W. C. McAuley were in
dicted to-day by the Federal Grand Jury
on the charge of having used the mails to
defraud. Thousands of people in all parts
of the countiy were made the dupes of the
"Empress Bicycle Company."
Under cover of the "'word contest" the
scheme was operated with profit io
Thompson but not to the 80,000 persons
who .are said to have coqueted for the
three bicycles which were promised out
not given to the successful contestants.
This part of the swindle was followed by
a circular offer to the dupes to sell them,
in return for their diligence in hurtling
for words, a bicycle for $40 cash or $50 on
the installment plan. Money was sent to
a large amount, but the wheels never
came â merely promises and excuses.
. It is said that Thompson and McAulÂ«y
failed to send between 300 and 400 wheels
for which money had been sent. Thomp
son left for parts unknown when the ex
posure came, but McAuley, who says he
innocently bought the business, has re
mained Here to stand trial. He claims he
was trying to carry out the obligations in
curred, but iound the load too heavy. W.
H. Patterson of Lorain, Ohio, testified
before the jury, however, that McAuley
wrote him, promising to send a wheel for
which money had been sent, but it did not
come.

Senators Sherman and Thurston Want
Nothing, bu' Oregon Desires
Recognition.
CANTON, Ohio, Dec. 3.â Major McKin
fey discussed many questions with many
men to-day. His first extended interview
â¢was with Senator J. M. Thurstonof Ne
braska, who told him, about the situation
in the West and described at length the
probable course of Congress this winter.
Major McKinley then had a pleasant
chat with Mr. Charlton, a member of the
Canadian Parliament, who had some in
teresting observations to make or: the sub
ject of reciprocity and of the establish
ment of closer commercial relations be
tween this country abd Canada.
' Hon. W. E. Mason of Chicago was the
next, man to gain the attention of the
President-elect. Mr. Mason's visit was a
purely personal one and he stated to Ma
jor McKinley that he was a candidate for
the Senate of the United States and only
asked fair treatment from his opponents.
-" Mr. Thurston and Mr. Mason took a I
drive with Mrs. ifcKinley, and upon I
their return for lunch they found that
' Nelson A. Dingley of Maine and his son,
15. N. Dingley, had arrived. Major Mo
'Kinley had a very long talk with Mr.
Dingley this afternoon and Senator Thurs
â  .ton also participated in a part of the con
:' ference.
Late in tbe afternoon Senators Mitchell
"â  "and McÃride and Representative B. Her
man of Oregon called on the President
â¢ elect and had pleasant chats with him.
/'Mr. Dingley is suffering from a cold nnd
. Dr. Phillips, the McKinley family physi
cian, was called in to see him. Upon the
"' advice of the physician Mr. Dingley will
.â¢remain over night in Canton. He is a

â¢tors Thurston and Mitchell left for Wash
" ington this evening. Mr. Dingley expects
to set out for the capital at 1:30 o'clock
Friday afternoon.
General Stuart L. Woodford stopped off
o on his way to Chicago to pay his respects
, (o the President-elect and dined with
. Major and Mrs. McKinley to-night.
* Representative R. W. Taylor of this dis
trict arrived from Washington this after
coon and called on the Major. He said
the opinion prevailed at the capital that
Senator Sherman had decided to become
= .an* active candidate for re-election to the

â¢ ington to-day was Representative M. M,
.: Johnson of North Dakota-
There was no Cabinet meeting to-day.
Major .McKinley talked with the visitors
â¢ whom he took into his confidence upon
i questions of public and party policy,
benator McÃride of Oregon thinks bis
â¢ State is entitled to recognition, and calls
- it the banner commonwealth of the Pacific
â¢ slope, but neither he nor Senator Mitchell
made, any Cabinet suggestions to the
President-elect.
'â  â¢ Senator Thurstonof Nebraska said be I

recognized in this way.
INTERVIEW WITH RONNA.
Is Going to Washington to Arrange for
the Inauguration, .
CLEVELAND, Omo, Dec. 3.â Mark
Hanna this afternoon returned from, a
two days' conference with Major Mc-
Kinley. He was asked:
"Mr. Hanna, has it been settled whether
you are to be the next Secretary of the
Treasury, or the next Senator from Ohio
to succeed Senator Sherman ?"
"Never mind what it will be. You
newspaper fellows are smart; but I will
fool you all yet. >:
He refused to throw any light on what
he meant by tbe remark, only to add that
he knew what he was talking about, and
that it would all come to pass in due time.
When asked about his proposed Wash
ington trip, he said :
"I will leave for the Capital Friday noon
via the Pennsylvania, going direct. One
of the chief objects of my visit will be to
arrange for the inaugural ceremonies. If
present indications augur anything I be
lieve the pomp and splendor attending
- McKinley's inauguration will be .the
grandest ever seen."
"Will you hold any important confer
ences?"
"I will hold several consultations with
leading Republicans. I will likely meet
Senators Sherman, Quay, Proctor and
oihera. I cannot say who the others will
probably he."
"Has McKinley determined to call a
special session of Congress?"
"Not yet. It is a little early to decide
definitely on that point. There are too
. many other matters to be oecided before
reaching any definite conclusion on that
score. I do not know whether a special
session of Coneress will be called or not."
HOW SUFFRAGE WAS LOST.
â  : Rev. Anna Shaw Tells of the Influences
That Defeated the Women in
California.
BROOKLYN, N. V., Dec. 3.â The Rev.
Anna Shaw spoke in Memorial Hall last
evening to the woman suffragists of
Brooklyn on the California woman suf
frage campaign. "It was not a Waterloo,
it was a Bunker Hill," said she. Miss
Shaw gave a full v-vid description of tbe
work done in California during the cam
paien. She told how a woman suffrage
plank was inserted into every party plat
form except that of the Democratic party,
and even there the woman suffragists got
a large enough splinter for many of the
most prominent Democrats to stand in
dependently uron.
She told of the promises of support that
came lo them from every side, until it
boemed to her that it was going to-be so
ea^y to win that actually they had nothtng
to fight for. This sentiment she expressed
to one prominent politician, who rather
dampened her enthusiasm by telling her
that thee men did not intend to do what
they had promised.
"Everything looked as if the Populistic
party would carry California," said M ss
Saw. "until ten days before the election,
when chances for the Republicans begin
to bnehten. About this time the Liquor
dealers' Association, the only organized
combatants they had in California, came
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Dec. 2.â Dr. Heber Roberts, whose varied and successful experiments with the X-rays have at
tracted wide attention, recently directed his experiment to benefiting the blind. The result of these experiments called
forth an adverse criticism from Nicola Tesla, which will shortly appear in the Electrical Review. This criticism was
shown to Dr. Roberts to-day and he replied:
"Professor Tesla is wrong in stating that I have promised sight to the totally blind. I claim, however, that progress
has been made. Interviews have already been printed with me in which I disclaimed the possibility of maKing practical
use of the X-ray on the totally blind with our present knowledge. We know of no material that will reflect the X-ray.
The ray must be focused upon the optic lobe if we get the conception of forms, but this is not necessary toget the impres-.
sion of tbe X-ray and the changing influence created by passing opacities.
"I cannot state at this time what, if any, beneficial results may be obtained from the use of the X-ray with the
nervous and hemorrhagic blind. Long, persistent use alone can tell."
While Dr. RoDerts was talking a number of students from tbe Missouri School for the Blind came into his office.
One of them was named Smith. He is about 18 years of age and cannot see anything. To prove his assertion, Dr. Roberts
put the boy's face to tbe fluoroscope and turned on the current. Between the Crooke's tube and the fluoroscope the little
ball to which the leaden letters ABC were pasted, was adjusted. Smith recognized them. Another student from the
blind school named Louis Smith was then tried. He can see lights and shadows, but cannot rnaka out letters. In a bright
electric light he could not read the leaden letter on the board. With the fluoroscope he could read and distinguish them.
"Professor Tesla says you can't see those letters with the X-ray any better than without," said the doctor to the boy.
"Professor Tesla does not know," he answered. "I know what I see without the X-ray is all a blur."
"All that has been done so far," said Dr. Roberts, "is merely ground work. If no advance is made from now on,
what has been so developed will be utterly worthless from a practical standpoint. We must simply keep on working in
the hope that future discoveries may utilize and make it of practical value."
i to the aid of the Republicans with < a large
contribution of money. The suffragists
had been; indorsed by schools, colleges,
persons and associations among the higher
classes, but the liquor-dealers were op
posed to them." V-\ Â Â,% . \i
Returning to the topic of California, the
speaker said that the leading Republican
clergymen in some places, who were op
posed to woman suffrage, urged the re
monstrants to form Republican clubs and
parade through the streets carrying lamps
on the end of sticks.
Miss Shaw closed her remarks with a
resume of the tactics adopted by the Cali
fornia politicians, and expressed indigna
tion that they should t promise to give
woman suffrage and then withdraw their
support. She quoted a California mascu
line acquaintance to the effect that the
promise had been given only in a spirit of
chivalry, but such chivalry she considered
an insult. Suffrage, if obtained, would re
lieve women from the need of any such
chivalry.
Miss Carrie Chapman, organizer, a resi
dent of Bensonhurst, who spent the
months of the campaign in Kansas, told
her experience in that State. She refer
red to the accounts of the movement sent
to a New York ' paper, by a correspondent
who, it was claimed^ obtained her infor
mation from a well-known gambler, and
declared that woman suffrage had won
the day in Kansas, although the final de
cision of the matter is now in the hands
of the Supreme Court.

SANGUINARY KENTUCKY FIGHT.
Morgan and Harrison Families Renew a
Feud â Two Ken Killed and Three
Fatally Wounded.
MIDDLESBORO, Ky., Dec. 3.â News
has reached this place of a bloody fight.
It took place in the mountainous regions
of Letcher County, and three men
were killed outright and two were fatally
wounded. Full details of the affair have
not yet been received, but some of the
facts are known.
There has been hostility between tbe
Morgan and Harrison families in that
county for several years and it culminated
during the recent hot political campaign
in open quarrels. The Morgans were
strong supporters of Congressman Colson
and the Harrisons were equally vigorous
partisans of ex-Congressman White.
The result of the trouble did not end
the trouble by any means and the two
families have talked very bitterly about
each other. They did not come actually
in contact with each other, however, until
the day in which the fight took place. On
that day William Morgan and his three
sons started for the mill. They were fully
armed, as both families have been pre
pared Jor trouble.
On the way to the mill they met James
Harrison with his two sons, Tom and
Henry. A few angry words were ex
changed on both sides and then weapons
were drawn and firing began.
At the first fire of the Harrisons old
man Morgan fell to the ground dead.
His sons kept up the fight and a vigorous
Jusillade was kept up until nearly all the
combatants were disabled.
When the battle was finally ended only
one on each side was left uninjured. In
addition to William Morgan, old man
Harrison and his son Henry lay dead on
the field of battle, and two sons of Mor
gan, Tom and Caleb, lay fatally wounded.
NATIONAL COUNCIL OF WOMEN.
Largest and Most A'otable Gathering in
>Â«â¢!Â» England's History. '
BOSTON, Mass., Dec 3.â ln Association
Hail to-day the National Council of
Women opened its annual convention.
This is undoubtedly the largest and most
notable gathering of women that New
England has ever seen. The council was
organized by women having the belief
that the best good of their homes and of
the Nation would be advanced by their
own greater unity ,of thought, sympathy
and purpose, and that an organized
movement of women would: best conserve,
the highest good of the family and state.
This outline constituted the principal
point of the opening address of Mrs. Mary
Lowe Dickinson, president of the council.
It was ; expected that the Countess of
Aberdeen would represent the interna
tional council, but she was unable to come
from British Columbia in time and Mrs.
Willoughby Cummings brought greetings
from her and from the women across the
border.
Addresses were made by Susan Prescott
Porter, Mrs. May Wright Bewail, Miss
Susan B. Anthony, Rev. Anna B. Shaw,
Mrs. Susan B. Fessenden and Mrs. Mar
garet J. Sands. .

HOPE FOR THE SIGHTLESS.
IOWA SOLDIERS'
HOME TROUBLE
Serious Charges Against
Commandant and
Trustees.
Warrants to Be Issued for Their
Arrest in a Few
Days.
All Kinds of Mismanagement and
Violation of Federal Statutes
Is Alleged.
DES MOINES, lowa, Dec 3.â C. D.
Fullen, Federal attorney for the Southern
District of lowa, to-day announced that
he will next week swear out warrants for
the arrest of the commandant and trus
tees of the lowa Soldiers' Home at Mar
shalitown on charges of violation of the
Federal statutes for the protection of pen
sioners in their rights to their pensions.
The officers against whom informations
will be sworn out are: Commandant J.
R. Ratekin and trustees S. B. Evans of
Ottumwa, J. J. Russell of Jefferson, A. T.
Birchard of Marshalltown, C. L. Davidson
of Hull, L. B. Raymond of Hampton and
John W. Morton of Washington. They
will be charged with the violation of sec
tions 4747 to 4749 of the Revised Statutes.
Nearly two years ago the management
of the home determined that it was unfair
to the State to maintain a home for
soldiers who received pensions and unless
the pensioners paid a part of their pen
sions to the institution. Accordingly, in
tbe interest of discipline and of justice to
the State, a rule was adopted requiring
that all pensioners pay to the home all
their pensions in excess of $6 per month.
The pensioners were required to deposit
their pension certificates with the com
mandant
The inmates took the matter to court
and the Marshall County court held
against the home. The Supreme Court of
the State reversed this and upheld the
rule. Then the matter was taken before
the Legislature and an attempt made to
enact a law overriding the rule. This
failed and the rule is now being enforced,
the money raised being turned over to the
support fund of the institution.
Attorney Fullen discovered that the
rule seems to be a violation of the statutes
referred to, which maKeit a misdemeanor,
punishable by tine and imprisonment, to
hold or attempt to enforce any 1 en against
a pension. He will swear out informations
under these sections and the officers will
be brought before Judge Woolson at once.
The statute provides that for such offenses
the offenders may be taken directly before
tbe court without indictment.
The same rule that is enforced in lowa
prevails in the State Soldiers' homes of
several other States, and if tbe court de
cides against the lowa institution it will
apply to all alike. The only exception
made by the Federal statute is in the case
of the National Soldiers' and Sailors'
homeÂ«, which are allowed to hold in trust
for pensioners all their pensions aboye $5
per month, to be turned over to them at
their discharge, or to their heirs in case of
death. No part of it can be confiscated.
PERILOUS PERIOD PASSED.
The Mayor of Chippewa Falls Thinks the
Tcwn Is Now Out of Danger
of a Flood.
CHIPPEWA FALLS, Wis., Dec. 3. -At
midnight Mayor Landley believes the
town out of danger. The water has been
falling slowly but steadily since 4 o'clock
this afternoon and tne only danger now is
from po-sible breakages of dams above.
Tbe Little Falls dam is reporteJ to
night in a very safe condition. River ex
perts ana loggers have made a thorough
investigation of the gorge and claim the
water will have fallen sufficiently by noon
to-morrow to permit merchants to move
back into their places of business.
The Government engineer who is here
examining the situation believes the gorge
will not go out suddenly, but is not pre
pared to say whether or not dynamite can
budge it. It is believed he will not author
ize such an attempt to be made.
The bustle of excitement of yesterday
was followed by a day of comparative in
activity. The only business transacted
was such as the flood made necessary.
The freight and paseeneer depots of the
Wisconsin Central and Milwaukee roads
are in a stidly demoralized condition.
The Milwaukee freight depot stands at
an angle of forty-rive degrees, and the
fact that it ih tied to the railroad tracks
with strong cables alone prevents it from
falling into the river. The water eddied
around it all day, slowly eating its foun
dation.
Mayor Landley has received numerous,
telegrams proffering assistance in case
aid is required, but replied that none wa*
needed, and that the ciiy was la good con
dition yet so far as danger to life is con
cerned.
A heavy snowstorm has set in and more
ice is forming. Reports from the farming
country are distressing. Hundreds are
homeless and all their personal effects
were sweDt away by the relentless waters.
The total damage done to the city to date
is estimated to be $100,000.

place this college year it will not come off
until next spring, and it will probably be
after the holidays before the Stanford girls
can learn whether Berkeley desires a
match.
At the present time there are twenty
rive or thirty girls playing here and many
more who would enter into the game if it
should be decided to get up a team. There
are several basket-ball teams in the neigh
borhood with which games will probably
be arranged later.

der Ahe's Track.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Dec. 3.â Chris yen der
Abe's racetrack at Sportsman's Park was
the scene of a unique strike to-day. Tin
purses offered have undergone a series of
reductions for several weeks and npw the
best offered is $125. This morningill the
owners on the day's programme called on
"the boss" and asked him to increase the
purses. This was refused and the owners
refused to allow their horses to run. The
track was idle to-day, and when entries
for to-morrow were called for there were
no responses. A compromise may be made
to-morrow.

BRITISH EMPIRE
LEAGUE MEETING
London's Lord Mayor Pre
sides Over a Notable
Gathering.
Absolute Unity Is Urged by
Several Distinguished
Speakers.
Plans Discussed f r the Protection of
All Possessions From Foreign
N^val Attacks.
LONDON, E.ng., Dec. 3.â The Duke of
Devonshire, addressing the British Em
pire League, to-day at a meeting of that
organization at tbe Guildhall, said that
the idea of imperial unity was progress
ing in some of the colonies as a practical
movement, though those engaged in the
movement were in some decree disap
pointed. Lord Salisbury and Mr. Cham
berlain, he said, were in sympathy with
the idea, but probably the time had not
yet arrived to settle the proposals of the
Ottawa conference. Still tbe develop
ments were tending toward unification.
R. R. Dobell moved that the meet
ing proceed to the election of officers for
the league for the ensuing year, and the
motion was carried. The Duke of Devon
shire was elected president. A. J.
Balfour and the Marquis of Dufferin were
among the vice-presidents chosen, and R.
R. Dobell, J. McDonald, Sir Donald k.
Smith and Bir Charles Tupper were
chosen among others as members of the
council. All the elections were unani
mous.
Mr. Dobell delivered a speech in which
he said that Great Britain stood in the
glorious position of having discarded all
attempts at a retaliatory policy. Canada,
he declared, wa3 second to none of the
colonies in ncr loyalty to England.
Canada admired the wonderful success of
the United States, but had a greater ad-
miration for the forbearance and gener-
osity which this country has shown toward
the United States for the last twenty-five
years. There was great reason to hope,
he said, that these sentiment? had not
been thrown away, and tbe time was com
ing when the United States would appre-
ciate them.
The Duke of Devonshire said that the
merchants of London might suggest the
means of establishing a better understand
ing between tbe home Government and
the colonies. Through the agency of the
league great progress had been made in
recent years for colonial defense. The
colonies knew exactly what the Govern
ment would undertake in case of an attack,
and also what would be expected of them
selves.
Tbe Government attached the greatest
importance to the renewal in some form
or other of naval arrangements with Aus
tralia. He hoped that tbe time would
soon come when another conference
would be held to consider that arrange
ment and extend it to the old colonies,
and expressed tbe hope that the oppor
tunity would be taken to reopen the dis
cussion of the whole question of colonial
defense.
Tue Lord Mayor, who presided, said I
that the most fitting manner in which to
celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of the j
reign of Queen Victoria would be to lay at
the feet of the first lady of the world' a
great scheme for the absolute and perfect
unity of the British empire. [Great
cheering.]
The Duke of Devonshire, in the course
of bis remarks, said that the colonial de
fense committee, consisting of representa
tives of the war, colonial and admiralty
offices, had desired him to make public to
colonial citizens the principles upon
which the plans of the colonial' defense
committee was based. He proceeded to
explain that tbe plans consisted of the
maintenance of Great Britain's supremacy
at sea upon the basis of a system of im
perial defense against attack from sea at
all places likely to be attacked. The com
mittee, he added, would advocate the cre
ation of adequate fixed defenses and
troops sufficient to cope with any possible
enemy.
ENGLAND AND EGYPT
A'o Probability That the British Iroops

LONDON, E.no., Dec. aâ The Daily
Standard, commenting on the decision
rendered at Alexandria in tbe famous
case of the caisse of the Egyptian debt
and the Government, will say to-morrow
the absurd decision will not have the
faintest effect upon the Egyptian policy of
the British Government. Should Great
Britain be asised to pay the amount neces
sary to satisfy the judgment, ihe Stand
ard says: "Her position in E^ypt will be
greatly strengthened and her sojourn
there prolonged. If the matter be ar
ranged in any other manner the political
maneuvers involved in the decision will
be baffled. E'-'ypt is the only portio-1 of
the Turkish empire for which humanity

SCENES IN THE REICHSTAG.
Herr Uebknecht's Fierce Discussion ot
Leading Questions Meets With
Repeated Reproval.
BERLIN, Geemaky, Dec. 3.â ln the
Reichstag to-day Herr Aver, Social Demo
crat, severely criticized tne action of the
Hamburg employers in refusing to sub
mit their dispute with the striking dock
laborers to arbitration.
Dr. Yon Boetticher, Imperial Secretary
of State for the Interior, said that the
terms of the proposal justified the em
ployers in refusing to accept it. He added
that Tom Mann, the English labor agita
tor, had expressed his dissatisfaction be
cause the strike bad been premature. As
a matter of fact, a concerted BtriKe of the
dock laborers at every port in Europe had
been planned.
Herren Aver and Liebknecht had pre
viously denied that the English agitators
had fomented the strike.
In the course of tbe discussion of the
question Herr Liebkneclit, Socialist,
severely criticized the remarks of Admiral
Yon Hollman, the Secretary of the Navy,
concerning the conduct of the sailors of
the German cruiser ltlis, who cheered for
the Kaiser as the ship went down with
nearly all hands off the coast ot China.
The speaker declared that the Itlia was
unseaworttiy and that the sailors who
were lost showed no more courage than
thousands of miners in the course of their
vrork.
The president rebuked Herr Liebknecht
for his remark, detracting from the
bravery of the sailors.
Herr Liebknecht said he had heÃrd
threats that the Reichstag mieht be dis
solved if the naval estimates were not
passed. There was a certain person be
hind that threat, be said, who would do
one thing to-day and another to-morrow,
nobody knowing what he might take into
his head to do.
This condition of things was unworthy
of the Reichstag.
The President again called the speaker
to order.
Resuming his remarks Herr Liebknecht
declared that the trial o: tho editors now
in progress for alleged libel against Baron
Marschall yon Bieberstein and others
showed that base intrigues were on foot in
the higher circles. Concluding, he said
that the socialists would vote neither men
nor money for militarism or navalism.
TRIAL OF BERLIN EDITORS.
Prince Hohenlohe Takes the Witness- Stand
and Throws Light on German Jour
nalistic Methods.
BERLIN, Gebmany, Dec. 3.â The trial
of the editors â Baron yon Leitzow and
Herren Foellmar, .Lecker and Berger â
charged with libeling Count yon Enlen
berg, Freiherr Marschall yon Bieberstein
and Prince Alex yon Hobenlohe, which
was begun here yesterday, was continued
to-day.
Prince Hohenlohe was called td the wit
ness-stand and in answer to a question
said that the assertion that the defendant
(Lecker) had interviewed him meant
nothing at all. Under the pretense that
be had an important disclosure to make
Lecker bad iorced his way into the official
an e-chamber at Breslau and accosted him
(Prince Hohenlohe) at the door, asking a
question upon some matter or other of a
wholly trifling nature.
It was possible, he said, that Lecker
had asked if Count Kapnist would suc
ceed Prince Lobanoff as Russian Minister
of Foreign Affairs, to which question he
received the answer that the witness knew
nothing about Prince Looancff ' s successor
and had no time to waste. The whole in
cident, he added, was utterly insigniti
cant.
Baron Marshall yon Bieberstein was
called to the stand. He said he was not
acquainted with either Baron yon Lietzow
or tLsTT Leckert.
Under the supposition that he had been
approached by a reporter at Breslau, who
was unable to take note 3in French, he
said he had written out the Czar's toast
for him, which was verified by a Russian
official. The wronÂ« version of the toast,
be said, was due to the mistake of a re
porter. Afterward it appeared that Baron
yon Lietzow was the author of tbe asser
tion that the false version had emanated
from the Foreign Office.
DECLINE TO ARBITRATE.
Employers Satisfied With the Status of
*..' the I>oek Laborers', Strike. '; : -
HAMBURG} Germany, Dec. 3. â The
striking dock laborers held several meet
ings this forenoon to discuss the matter of
the refusal of the employers to submit Ihe
dispute to a board of arbitration, and it
was decided to aslc the strikers' commit
tee to declare a general strike. -
The Employers', Association has written
a letter to Senator Hachman in justifica
tion of its refusal to abitrate the differ- j
ences with the strikers, taking the ground
that the strikers are being supported by
foreign assistance and becoming weaker
in their position, while their work is being
satisfactorily. performed' by constantly ar
riving foreign workers at the old rates of

Mxmsignor Martinelli Receives a
â¢ . " Cablegram From the
Vatican.
The Holy Father Grieved by the
Agitation Created by False
Rumors
â WASHINGTON, D. C. Dec. 3.â The
flood pf gossip following the deposition of
Bishop Keane from the rectorship of the
Catholic University of America, appear
iÂ»g in the American newspapers, has
reached Rome and caused grave concern.
This is shown by the unusual step taken
by the Cardinal Secretary of State msend
ine the following cablegram, received this
afternoon at the apostolic legation here:
Rome, Deeembes 3, 1896.
' Montignor Martinelli, Apnttolic Delegate, Wash
ington, IX C, U. S. A.: Tue Holy Fattier has
learned with great sorrow of the agitation
rreatpd in the United States by pretended
i rresrondence and telegrams from Rome
i hMiouiicing measures soon to be taken

f . ;ished piofessors of the Catholic University.
J our Excellency will deny all such falsehoods
which are the product of reprehensible ma
tninations. M. Carpinal Rampolla.
A Catholic churchman well versed with
all the steps leading up to Bishop Keane's
removal said to-night that the action of
the Holy Father in sending the cablegram
ahovt "ahould put a stop to all further
â¢gossip on the subject. It was
weif understood, he said, in church
circles that Bishop Keane's removal was
brought about by German ecclesiastical
influence, and it was hoped by the same
influence that further changes in the
same direction and following the same
â rines would follow.
It is' stated here to-night that Fathers
Markin and Cloyd of this city, warm
friend? of Bishop Keane, will accompany
ijiru on his visit to tne Eternal City.

SUPREME COURT FIELD DAY.
Joseph H. Call's Masterly Effort for the
Government Against the Southern
Pacific Company.
WASHINGTON, D. C. Dec. 3.â The
famous case of the Southern Pacific Rail
toad against the United States, involving
title to nearly 1,000,000 acres of land in
Southern California and which will affect
several million acres of other lands, was
p lrgued yesterday and to-day.
This case has attracted the very best le
gal talent of the country. The counsel
engaged were, on the part of the Southern
Pacinc, Josepn H. Choate, J. Hubley Ash
ton and C. H. Tweed, the regular attorney
of the Southern Pacific; on the part of
the Government, ex-Congressman Payson
of Illinois. Joseph H. Call and As-
Bisiaut Attorney-General Dickinson. The
principal oral arguments were delivered
by ,Mr. Choate and Mr. CalL who both
gpoke at length. .
A large number of people were in the
courtroom to-day to hear the learned
C'Unsel. It was a regular field day in the
Supreme Court.
Attorneys from New York and Chicago
who were'in attendance and listened iii
tehtly' pronounced tLe argument oi Mr.
Call Xo be one of the best they ever heard
in.- that law case.
-.' M// Call's argument disclosed a greater
â¢.fanijliarity with the law and the facts of
â case than the argument of his famous ad-
' .ve'esary.

CHANCES OF A FUNDING BILL
Sim Prospect* at the Coming Session,
Says Senator Gear, but Congressman
â¢ â¢' . â¢ Powers Is Hopeful.
' WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec 3â Senator
Gear.cbairman of the Senate Committee on
Pacific Railroads, who reported a funding
biU to that body at the last session, is in
clined to believe tnat his measure will not
be passed by this Congress.
He said to The Call correspondent to
night that there would not be time to
pass it. He also expressed the opinion
that the'Dingley bill would also fail, and
that little, if any legislation, would be ac
complished beside the passage of regular
appropriation bills.
.Representative Powers of Vermont,
chairman of the Pacific Railroads Com
mittecof Ibe House, whose bill is similar
and almost identical with the Gear
measure, arrived at the Riggs House to
night, where he was seen by The Call
Cfrresnondent.
He said that bis bill was on the calendar
of the House and could be called up at
any time by action of the ruies committee.
H said he had not con-uite i with any of
hin colleagues on the P.jci tic Roads Com
mittee or with any one regarding the sub
ject, but that it was his intention to press
tne bill* to a passase this win'er.
He said that it must be passed now or
pever, for if it did not go through this
session the Government would foreclose
Dn the roads. This, he thinKs, is just
what Mr. Huntington and the Union
Paoific people want, as they want to buy
Lhe roads at public auction. â¢
Inquiry at the Hotel Normandie failed
to find Mr. Huntington. He always stops
there, but the head clerk :-aid he did not

A MOST DARING ROBBERY.
Three Men Coolly Loot the Office of the
Home Brewing Company, St.
Louis.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Dec. 3.â A most daring
robbery was perpetrated in the office of
the Home Brewing Company, in this city,
this afternoon.
Three men, armed with revolvers, en
tered the office of the brewing company
at 3 o'clock and compelled Cashier Robert
Haverkamp (to hand over what money he
had before him. Not satisfied with this
amount they went behind tbe counter and
looted the money-drawer. The total
amount secured is nearly $1000.
Half a dozen clerks and several cus
tomers were in the office when the high
waymen entered. The leader ordered
everybody to hold up their hands, and
compeilpd them to "line up" along the
wall. The order was complied with with
alacrity. Cashier Haverkamp was busily
engaged on his books at tne time. One of
the higwaymen approaching him said :
"May I look at your city directory?"
"The directory is in the back room,"
was his reply.
He started to get the book for his visitor,
when he was confronted with a big re
volver and told to hand over the money
in his possession. He tiad between $300
and $400 on his desk and this was handed
over.
It was quickly passed to the leader out
side the railing, who had every person
frightened to death. The man who had
asked for the directory then went behind
the counter again and went through tbe
drawer, taking therefrom a considerable
sum of money. He then turned his atten
tion to the safe, and its contents were soon
in the possession of tbe robber.
Cashier Haverkamp does not know how
much money was secured outside of the
$300, but is of the opinion that it is be
tween $500 and $600. The men then bacKed
cooily out of tne office and made their
escape. The police were notified instantly,
but no trace has been found.
THE CASTLES IN PHILADELPHIA.
Will Probably Remain in the City of
Brotherly Love for Five or Six
Months.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Dec aâ Mr.
and Mrs. Walter M. Castle of San Fran
cisco, who returned from Europe last
Thursday, came to Philadelphia on the
day after their arrival in New York and
are now at the home oT Mrs. Castle's
sister in the northern section of the city.
Mr. Castle said that his wife was still in
poor health and that it was tneir inten
tion to remain here for five or six months
until Mrs. Castle, who is now under medi
cal treatment, shall have recovered her
health.
Mr. Castle appeared to be very solici
tous about his wife's condition and said
that the physicians whom he had con
sulted here had in:ormed him that the
case would require radical treatment aud
would take perhaps four to five months.
He expressed himself as being much
gratified at tbe manner of the unfortunate
episode through which they had passed
abroad had been taken up by their friends
on both sides ofthe Atlantic and by the
newspapers, which latter, he said, have
treated them in the most kindly manner.
Both, he and Mrs. Castle had been much
annoyed by the widespread publicity
which was being given to every movement
they made.
Mrs. Castle, prior to her marriage, re
sided in this city with her parents, Mr.
and Mrs. A. Weill, now of Wilmington,
N. C, where her father is the agent of the
Atlantic Coast line.
Miss Weill went to San Francisco to
visit an i unt, and while there she met Mr.
Castle, whom she subsequently married.
A sister of Mrs. Castle, the one with
whom she ia at present stopping, is mar
ried to a well-known Philadelphia busi

BOSTON. Mass., Dec. aâ The members
of the orchestra of Colonel Mapleson's
Imperial Opera Company, who retused to
play last evening unless they were paid

to-day.
Alter spending the entire forenoon in
fruitless endeavors to secure musicians to
take their places Mr. Eugene Tompkins,
proprietor of the Boston Theater, an
nounced that the grand opera season was
at an end. The manager of the theater
said:
"The grand opera season is ended be
cause of the inability to secure another
orchestra. We have been trying all
morning to get another orchestra together
but could not do it in time. They would
require four or five hours of rehearsal and
it could not be dope in time.
"The company has entirely disbanded,
but the art sis will remain here and, if
possible, arrangements will be made for a
sacred concert for Sunday for the benefit
of the chorus and the employes of the
company."
The trouble is with the orchestra. Mr.
Tornpkins guaranteed their salaries in
Boston, but they demanded that he pay
them for the salaries which were run up
in Philadelphia. This Mr. lompkins re
fused to do.

Sequel to the Robbery of
a Chicago Washer
woman.
The Footpad Seeks to Escape
by Boarding a Moving
Cable-Car.
Cries of the Woman Lead to H s Cap
ture After a Most Despsrate
Struggle.
CHICAGO, 111., Dec. 3.â After robbing
a washerwoman of a purse containing a
silver dollar Edward Roggers boarded a
moving cable train at Ashland avenue
and Madison street to-night, and when
seized by the conductoi, who beard the
victim's cries for the police, emptied a re
volver and regained his liberty. Four
men were shot in the fusillade of bullets
and the lives of other passengers were en
dangered.
The wounded are: John McCathie, con
ductor on the car, shot through the right
hand ; James Grassy, a passenger, bullet
wound in right leg; Officer Connell, shot
in right leg near the knee; Officer Jen ks,
slight flesh wound under left arm. The
entire train was crowded with passengers
and the shooting created great excite
ment. Roggers is an ex-railway employe
and lives at 128 One Hundred and Thir
tieth street. He was placed under arrest
and the stolen pocketbook was recovered
in bis possession.
Mrs. Mary Mitchell, the victim of the
robbery, had just delivered a package of
laundry to a house in Madison street and
received a silver dollar in payment. As
she came out into the street again Rog
gers, it is claimed, seized the pocketbook
from her hand and caught a cable train
that was passing. Mrs. Mitchell followed
after him and attempted to attract a
policeman. Conductor McCath c saw her
and seized Roggers by the left wrist. As
he did so the alleged robber drew a
revolver and fired one shot at the conduc
tor, the buliet entering his right hand.
At this moment Officers Jenks, Riley
and Connell came up, and Roggers com
menced firing at them. He had sent two
shots into the car, and Grassy was
wounded by one of the bullets. With his
two companions wounded Officer Riley
leaped upon Koggers and bore him to the
floor of the car. The latter, while on his
back, placed the revolver against the po
liceman's cbest and pulled the trigger.
The weapon had already been emptied.
REDWOOD CITY WILL CONTEST.
Last Testament of James Quentin to Be
Attacked by a Putative
Daughter.
REDWOOD CITY, Cal., Dec. 3.â The
will oi the late James Quentin, a wealthy
ranch-owner of San Mateo County, dis
posing of property valuea at $100,000 or
more, came up for probate in the Superior
Court at this place this morning. By the
terms oi the will his estate is left entirely
to strange: s and charitable institutions.
To Dr. Mark Emerson, the executor of the
will, he bequeathed $5000; to John Wil
son, $5000; to George Wilson, $5000; to
Thomas Stealey and his wife, one-third of
all his real and personal property; to
Ruth O'Brien, $1000; to Elien O'Brien,
$1000, and all the remainder of his real and
personal p roperty to the Protestant Or
phan asylums of Sacramento and San
Francisco.
The deceased was a native of Tennessee,
and at the time of his death was 77 years
of age. He left no known living relatives
except Mrs. J. W. Wilson of this place â
no relation to the devisees of the will â
who claims to be his daughter, but for
whom he expressly fails to provide on
the ground that >he is not his daughter
and has no claim upon him.
Upon the calling of the case for a hear
ing this morning Attorney Ross of this
place informed the court that Mrs. Wil
son was about to commence proceedings
contesting the will. The case was there
upon continued one week. The fight
promises to be a bitter one, in the course
of which sensational developments may
be expected. As a forerunner as to what
may happen, it is sufficient to say that
one Edward Stetson, who has been work
ing on the ranch of the deceased for many
years, was arrested a lew days ago and
charged with being insane. The hearing
of the insanity charge came up this after
noon. Dr. Emerson, the executor of tbe
Quentin will, swore to the charge and to
day appeared as a witness against him. To
all appearances Stetson was perfectly snne
and the examining physicians refused to
commit him.
STANFORD CLUBS' TOUR.
Arrangements Completed for the Northern

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Dec.
3. â The northern holiday tour of the Stan
ford Glee and Mandolin clubs has all been
booked now, and the 2500-mile trip is as
sured. H. H. Brown was appointed ad
vance agent and general manager, as was
noted some weeks ago in The Call. Since
his appointment he haÃ devoted his entire
time and attention to arranging for the
trip and its succobs.
Entertainments are now booked as fol
lows, the clubs expecting to leave Decem
ber 18, or shortly thereafter; December 24,
Tacoma; December 25, Beattle ; December
26, Victoria; December 28, Vancouver;
December 30, Por land ; Decamber 31,
Oregon City; January 1. 1897, Salem; Jan
uary 2, Eugene; Jannary 4, Chico; Jan
uary 5, Marysvilie; January 6, Sacra
mento. It is possible that there will be
a wind-up entertainment in San Fran
cisco on t.;e completion of the tour.
Brown says that the outlook for the trip
is most encouraging, both from a social
and financial point of view. All past
visits of Stanford organizations to the
Northwest have met with a hearty wel
come, and letters received by members of
the clubs indicate that the reception will
be more enthusiastic this season than ever
before. An unusually large proportion of
Stanford's students are from the States of
Oregon and Washington, and the uni
versity is quite ronular there, so tne
musical-club members feel that they will
give their entertainments among friends.
Twenty-three men, all told, will make
the trip.'wbich, it is estimated, will take
the best part of three weeks.

SANTA ROSA'S NEW RAILWAY.
Electric Line Soon to Be Constructed
From the Sonoma City to
Tidewater.
BANTA ROSA, Cal., Dec. 3.â The prop
osition to connect this city with tidewater
by an electric railroad is beginning to
assume a business-like attitude and forty
days will not elapse ere ground will bo
broken an.d the first rail laid. N. W. Grid
wold of Kenwood, one of the leading pro
moters of the new line, was in this city
to-day and in an interview with a Call
representative said that the bonds were
already placed in New Y T ork. Just as soon
as the new corporation has the money
from the sale of the bonds to its credit the
contract will be let and the construction
rapidly forwarded.
The new road will prove a boon to the
farmers, more especially to those about to
engage in the raising of sugar beets, as a
$1 per ton rate for a thirty-mile haul will
be made. The first sod will be turned at
the Embarcadero landing, just over the
INa pa County line, and the first contract
will be for thirty miles of road. The com
pleted road will connect Sonoma and
Santa Rosa via Glen Ellen, Kenwood,
Aqua Cahente and Melita. The foremost
merchants of this 'city are subscribers to
the new project, realizing the great bene
fits that will accrue to them commercially
when the fertile valleys crossed by the new
road can cheaply and expedlticusly land
their produce here.
The Farmers' Institute will convene
here to-morrow and the effect of the new
road upon the sugar beet industry will be
discussed.

right side, which may extend. It has not
reached his tongue yet and when awake
he talks incessantly.

BUILDING TO THE
CITY OF MEXICO
Huntington's New Railway
Venture Across the
Boundary.
Seeks to Monopolize Traffic To
and From the Ancient
Capital.
Construction of the Road From Reata
to Monterey Has Been
Resumed.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Dec. 3.â lt was re
ported some weeks ago that C. P. Hunt
ington had obtained control of tlie im
portant Monterey and Mexican Gulf Rail
way, running from the most progressive
city of Mexico toTampico, a growing sea
port that is wrestling away much of the
commerce of Vera Cruz. But this deal
seems to have fallen throu.h, though
Huntington was known to have been
negotiating with the Belgian owners of
the road. The best evidence that he did
not succeed in getting it is shown m the
fact that he has resumed the construction
of his road from Reata, on the Mexican
International, toward Monterey, a siiort
but very important piece of work, which
gives him a great strategic advantage over
the Monterey and Mexican Gulf road in
the handling of freight from the gulf.
It was Huutineton'sold-tifte rival and
foe, J. A. Robertson, who prevented him
from securing control of the Mexican Gulf
road, and it was apparently to work the
ruin of that road that Huntington com
menced the construction of the Reata
branch. Robertson, seeing danger ahead,
turned his road over to Belgian capitalists,
with whom Huntington was unsuccessful
in dealing.
There is every indication, according to
advices received here from a high source
In the City of Mexico, that Huntington is
aiming for that city. He will not rest
content without securing tne best end of
the business and a monopoly is possible.
The lines of his present small branches, if
extended, will shorten the distance be
tween the United States and tbe Mexican
capital by a eood many miles and effect a
great saving in time, while the traffic
through the rich and populous section
surrounding Monterey will yield hand
some returns. At present Huntington,
no matter how many branches he builds,
is bound to use the Mexican Central in
ge:ting to the City of Mexico, which is the
financial and business center of the re
public No city in the United States en
joys such relatively overshadowing im
portance as does the capital of Mexico,
and a railroad that contemplates absorb
ing the bulk of the trade of that country
to and from the United States must inev
itably find itself pointing toward the an
cient capital.
The new road being built by Huntington
is under the management of T. W. Robert
son, who has constructed a good many
miles of road for Huntington. It will en
ter Monteiey from the north, and when
finished to that city will leave the Mexf
can Gulf road with practically nothing to
draw from, either local or through traffic
The owners of the Mexican Gulf road are
not ignorant of the peculiar situation and
the struggle for supremacy in that rich
portion of Mexico promises to be very
lively and interesting, especially to the
railroads which now enjoy the trade of
the capital which will be threatened next
by the insatiate genius of the Southern
Pacific
NO LIMIT O N RATES.
One Shortcoming in the Sustained Wright
Irrigation Act.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Dec. 3â Besides the
proposed amendments to the Wright law,
irrigators are agitating the question of
having the general law amended in the
next Legislature, so as to dispose of the
obstacle presented by Judge Ross' decision
regarding private and public water rates.
According to Judge Ross' decision, private
or individual agreement as to water rates
must be subordinate to the rates fixed by
law. This works a great hardship in some
cases, notabiv where some small settle
ments are culled upon to pay rate? suffi
cient to yield a certain percentage of profit
to the company, where otnerwise private
rates might be made. At present the irri
gation rates must be fixed sufficiently
high to yield the company a revenue of
from 6 to 18 per cent upon its plant.
There does not seen: to have been any
limit placed by the law upon irrigation
rate 9, and this omission will receive at
tention from irrigators, who hope to wield
sufficient influence in tne Legislature to
bring about the desired amendments.
DAMAGED BY SLIDING BAND.
Canadian Pacific Railway Wins a Suit
Against Trrigatort.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Dec B.â Colonel
Robett B. Stanton, the noted engineer^
who went through the Grand Canyon of
the Colorado in a boat, returned to-day
from British Columbia. He was called
there by the Canadian Pacific Railroad
Company to inspect a peculiar effect of
irrigation on lands contiguous to its road
and to testify, as an expert witness, in a
suit brought by the railroad company
against the farmers.
The action was brought in the Supreme
Court to obtain an injunction against the
farmers of the Thompson River Valley to
prevent them from further irrigating and
thus causing landslides tnat swept down
upon the track of the railrond comi any.
"Along the Thompson River the land
rises in bunches from 50 to 500 feet above
the river," said Colonel Stanton. "The
soil is gravely, with clay subsoil. Much
water is needed to irrigate it. Tne farmers
used great quantities of water from creeks
back in tLe mountains, and the ground,
becoming saturated, softens and begins to
take a journey on its own account.
"It comes off in great chunks that
sweep the railroad-bed aside and into the
river. In one place sixty-six acres slid
down in a lump, and in one place the slide
was 300 feet deep, and in another 500 leet.
I estimated *.hat in one landslide there
were 32,000,000 tons of earth.
"Tuis country where these landslides
occur is about six miles long, and the
rail load company has been put to im
mense expense to maintain its road. At
times the road has been shoved out of
place five feet in a night, causing great ex
pense to replace it. The facts were all
brought out in court, and tlie jury, after
being out forty minute*, brought in a ver
dict in favor of the railroad company,
finding that it was the irrigation of the
land that caused ihe landslides."

JAILED AT SAN JOSE.
Arrest of a Burglar Who Had Operated
in All Sections of Santa Clara
County.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Dec. 3.â Jess6 Hender
son, who is wanted in this county for
several burglaries, was brought to the
County Jail this evening by City Marshal
Cook of San Luis Obispo. Henderson
began his peculations at Mountain View.
He arrived in that town about two weeks
ago with J. Ford, who is now in the
County Jail awaiting examination on a
charge of looting 8. Weilheimer's house
at that place. The men had a horse and
buggy and an unusually large trunk.
They secured work as woodenoppers near
the place.
About a week ago the men looted the
house of T. Dillar and secured a quantity
of provisions. Ford was then arrested by
Constable Martin, and Henderson fled
with the horse ana buggy. He went to
Los Gatos, where he commuted a burglary
and secured several watches and pieces of
jewelry. Boulder was next visited and
another haul made.
When arrested Henderson had the
trunk with him- It contains considerable
jewelry and other articles, evidently the
booty secured in different raids. Several
pieces of jewelry secured in the Los Gatos
robbery have been identified.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.- ~~~
All talks about the fight agree there was
a foul somewhere.
Even the most enterprising merchant
cannot do a bright business on a dark
street.
The tariff may not have been an issue
in the campaign, bnt itis the biggest thing
above the horizon just now.
Cuba is a natural market for the United
States, but as lonp as Spain has control
nature will never have a showing.
It is now almost certain that the fund
ing bill will be pushed forward by the
Huntington lobby this winter. Get your
club ready.
The better the streets are Ugh ted the
more clearly we can see that other im
provements are needed and, perhaps, also
bow to make them.
The tide of tourist travel has turned our
way, and it is time for the carnival cities
of tbe State to begin making ready for
their coming frolic?.
Almost anything counts as a novelty
during the Christmas season, but many a
California product would be a real novelty
for your Eastern friends.
There are some people who are still talk
ing of a gold Democrat for McKinley's
Cabinet, but they are men who have no
reputation for horse sense.
The New York Times says the country
needs revenue and rest, but it overlooks
the fact that it also needs protection End
industry before taking a rest.
It will be noticed that the fruit-growers
ta'.ned of protection and not of tree silver.
They know what the vital money ques
tion is to the industries of California.
The discussion on trie make-up of the
next Cabinet has revealed tbe fact that in
tho minds of statesmen a senatorsbip is
better than a Cabinet position any day.
The report that the man who first nom
inated Bryan for Congress has just gone
crezy will raise a suspicion that he must
have been a little bit insane at tbe start.
Why put a higher tax on beer or on any
other American product when we can
raise all tbe additional revenue we need
by increasing the tax on foreign imports?
The Canadians are asking of their Gov
ernment more protection for their indus
tries and will probably get it. A low tariff
suits them no better than tbe fiasco tariff
suits us.
Cleveland's message will probably be
long enough to reach almost every subject
of public interest, but the chances are it
will not touch a single one of them in the
right spot.
Weyler's decision not to strike a crush
ing biaw at the Cubans will give him an
opportunity to reconsider the matter at
New Year's and swear off from the scheme
altogether.
"While our Board of Health is still wrest
ling with impure milk that in New York
has got along iar enough to begin a fight
- against adulterated beer, and it is making
the froth fly.
Cleveland might at least recognize the
belligerency of Cuba and compel the
Spaniards to conduct the war against
them in accordance with the principles of
humanity and civilization.
According; to the Hartford Courant Yale
has never won in any athletic contest when
1 President Dwipht was out of the country,
and it points sadly to tbe fact that he was
. away over in Europe when Yale met
Princeton this year.
Before the war broke out in Cuba our
exports to the island amounted to more
than $17,000,000, but during the current
year it is estimated they will not exceed
$6,000,000. Bo it appears the war is costing
us something as well as the combatants.
It is reported that an effort is now being
made to induce Cleveland to place the
unall postoffices of the entire country
under the classified service rules, so as to
enable the incumbents to hold on, but it
ia doubtful if even Grover has gall enough
for that.
Congress will be called on to discuss
again the old subject of the tax on alcohol
tifed in the arts. It is a perennial chest
nut and every session a dozen or more
orators have a whack at it without suc
ceeding in openine it or even getting the
burr off.
There is once more a good deal of talk in
Washington about enlarging the White
House, and really something ought to be
done in the matter, if for no other reason
than that of giving the people of the Na
tional capital a chance to talk of some
thing else.
On all issues involving protection to our
industries, the expansion of our com*
merce, the appointment of a Secretary of
Mines and the defeat of the funding bill
all Californians can work together. Let
us keep them to the front, therefore, asd
work to win.
The unwonted severity with which the
winter has opened in the East has already
brought about a great deal of suffering in
widespread districts and the coming Christ
mas will find many a home desolate which
a few weeks ago was bright with prospects
of prosperity.
THE FUNDING BILL.
.Â« â¢- 'â â  ' . â â¢ - - â 'Â« â  â : .--â¢,.â :'
According to the Washington corre
spondent of the New York Tribune a strong
effort will be made to pass the Pacific
Railroad funding . bill ' at the coming
session of â â  Congress. ; The information
probably is well founded, since the Tribune,
ai a staunch advocate of the bill, is in a
position to enable its correspondents to
get accurate information: concerning
every move which the promoters of the
scheme desire to make public.
It seems clear from this the people of
California will have to fight again this
winter the battle they fotuht last year. It
is time, therefore, that they should make
preparations for the contest. What was
done last winter was sufficient to check
the passage of the bill at that time and
this winter we ought to be able to kill the
scheme altogether.
It certainly needs no argument; to con
vince the people of California that the
funding bill is of greater importance to
' them than any other measure likely to
come before this session of Congress. J If
the Pacific roads debt is funded the mo
nopoly will be continued in power for
fifty years at least and the industries of
California will be tompelled to pay in
transportation rates nearly the whole of
the interest charged upon the funding
debt.
It is for the welfare of the State that -we
fight the funding bill and not for any an
tagonism to the railroad company. This
faot should be impressed upon Congress so
forcibly that the attitude of Californians
cannot be mistaken. We must not let the
idea get abroad that the opponents of the
measure are sandlot agitators, actuated
more by a hatred of corporations than by
any far-seeing regard for the; interests of
the commonwealth. We must make clear
the fact that it is the business element of
the State which opposes the bill, and that
the opposition is founded in good reason
and in law.
1 The California delegation in Congress as
a whole can be counted on to guard the
interests of the State by every means in
its power, but our Congressmen should not
be left to fight the battle alone. From
every county and from every city of note
there should go to Congress a protest
against the passage of the iniquitous meas
ure. It should be made clear even to the
dullest comprehension that on this sub
ject the people of California are united by
the very fact that the passage of the bill
will be injurious to the interests of all.
Congress will assemble next week. It is
possible the promoters of the funding bill
will bring it forward as soon as the session
begins, and endeavor to rush it through at
once. It is time therefore for the people
of California to take action on the matter.
Let us not be caught napping at this junc
ture. The final battle in the long struggle
may take place at any day, and we must
be prepared to defend our rights, our in
terests and our welfare.
A FRUIT TARIFF.
The memorial to Congress adopted by
the Fruit-growers' Association is com
prehensive, terse and masterly. It states
clearly what the fruit-growers ask of
Congress, the reasons which justify the
request and the facts on which they are
based. In short, it contains every ele
ment which gives value to such a docu
ment, and will undoubtedly receive care
ful consideration when Congress enters
upon the work of re-establishing a thor
ough protective tariff.
The memorial calls for specific duties
instead of those levied upon the ad
valorem principle, on the ground that the
latter tend to undervaluations and frauds
which are directly beneficial to foreign
producers, and goes on to point out that
even where cheap and inferior merchan
dise is honestly valued the result is to en
courage the unloading ot inferior goods
upon the American market, thus dis
placing better classes of merchandise pro
duced at home.
After stating the exact amount of duty
which would be necessary to protect the
home grower of fruit, nuts, olives and
raisins, the memorial goes on to say:
We do not seek high duties to enable us to
charge high prices for our fruit. Th 6 fact is,
our success depends wholly on our ability to
market our large and rapidly increasing prod
uct, and we know we cannot do this nnless we
keep prices down so as to stimulate and in
crease consumption; 80 that the consumer is
assured of low prices whatever may be the
duty if we remain in the field; and the only
question is, Shall we have the market or shall
it be yielded up to the foreign producer?
The question thus stated expresses the
whole sum and substance of tue issue in
volved in protection for our home indus
try. It is the simple one of whether we
shall build up our own country or the in
dustries of foreign lands. As is clearly
pointed out in the memorial, the amount
of protection asked for is barely sufficient
to cover the differences in the rate of
wages and the cost of transportation
which have to be paid by the California
prodacer as compared with the Enropean.
The protection, therefore, is in the inter
est of American labor as much as in the
interest of the fruit-grower.
The memorial invites the attention of
Congress to the fact that there is no ob
jection, general or otherwise, and there
never has been, to any adequate pro
tective duties except possibly from im
porters, and the fruit-grower* very justly
assert that surely no legislation should be
framed to help the importer to the injury
of the home producer.
One of the interesting features of the
memorial is found in the statements of the
opening paragraph, that whereas in the
recent election it was persistently asserted
by the defeated party that the single issue
Defore the people was that of free silver,
yet the victors in the contest declared that
the paramount issue was that of protec
tion to American industry. This is an ex
act etaiement of the truth of the case.
The Republican victory was due to the
fact that it was pledged to restore the pro
tective tariff, and the fruit-growers of Cali
fornia have a right to expect that protec
tion will be given them by the coming
Congress. ______________
VILLAGE POSTMASTERS.
It is asserted by the Washington corre
spondent of the Philadelphia Ledger that
another attempt will be made this winter
to persuade President Cleveland to put all
fourth-class postmasters of the entire
country under the classified service so as
to prevent the removal of the incumbents
by the next administration.
It wilt be remembered tnat Mr. Cleve
land was urged to make this change last
year, and had the matter at that time
under serious consideration. It was then
decided that tho change was not practic
able. If there is any good reason for be
lieving that the President will give the
matter more favorable consideration now
than he aid then it has not been made
known. Nevertheless, it is worth while to
direct public attention to the scheme, for
it shows the eagerness with which the
mugwumps and the friends of the present
office-holders are resorting to every means
ol retaining those officials in office when
Mr. Cleveland goes out. /
There has been an enormous change in
the condition nf the civil service since the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1890.
incoming of the present administration.
President Cleveland, haying filled the of
tices of the country with Democrats, has
done everything he could to give them a
life tenure of their positions. It is as
serted that when President McKinley
takes office he will have less than 700 good
appointments at his disposal instead of
the 80,000 which have usually been left to
the appointment of the incoming execu
tive.
The diminution of patronaee will be of
course nn advantage to Mr. McKinley,
inasmuch as it will relieve him of the
trouble of distributing it. Nevertheless it
is donbtful whether it will be altogether
beneficial to the country. Certainly if
Mr. Cleveland should at this late day go
further in the direction of putting bia ap
pointees to office under the classified ser
vice he would lay himself open to the
charge of intentionally depriving his suc
cessor of patronage which Cleveland had
him-elf enjoyed and profited by to ad
vance the measures of his administration.
The people of the United States are
generally favorable to the extension of
civil service rules and ridding our politics
of much of that spoils system which has
been its bane in former years. Neverthe
less they are not prepared to indorse this
scheme by which Mr. Cleveland can give
to his appointees life positions in the
Government service. The advancement
of the new system ought to be conducted
fairly, and not in the interests of a dis
credited administration. The attempt
therefore to get the President to put
fourth-class postmasters under the classi
fied service will be closely watched, and if
he undertakes* to do it, the result will
probably be some action of Congress
which will reopen the whole subject.
A FOUL AFFAIR.
The patrons and advocates of pugilism
base their admiration for it upon a belief
that -it is essentially a manly sport. They
argue that it encourages and promotes
those virtues which are founded upon
strength, courage, endurance and tbe
spirit of faff play. They will have great
difficulty, however, in maintaining that
admiration or advancing those arguments
in the face of tbe referee's decision in the
contest between Filzsimmonsand Sharkey
on Wednesday evening.
The decision awarding the victory to
Sharkey was so evidently foul it was re
ceived with hoots and hisses as soon as
announced. Among the thousands of per
sons who witnessed the contest and
watched it closely there is a general agree
ment that the decision was a deliberate
outrage. There is, moreover, abundant
evidence that the referee was chosen as
part of a prearranged plan to give the vic
tory to Sharkey, no matter what hap
pened. In other words, it seems to have
been a scheme to rob honest bettors of
their money and make a sure thing for
those who were on the inside.
To carry out such a scheme in the pres
ence of thousands of keenly interested wit
nesses required a referee of more than
ordinary nerve and gall. The contest was
wholly in the hands of Fitzsimmons from
the beginning. At the end Sharkey was
whipped to a standstill and there was no
spirit left in him. Then it was that the
referee stepped in with an announcement
of a foul and gave the victory and the
money to the defeated man.
Tbs evidence of foul play in the case is
too strong to be set aside. It behooves the
members of the club under whose patron
age tbe contest was held to investigate the
matter thoroughly and clear themselves
from suspicion of any part in the ugly
business. As affairs stand at present
pugilism ha** been reduced to the lowest
kind of disgrace in this City, and even
sports will refuse to sanction it further.

Letters From the People.
Wonderful Glasgow,
Wh& the Most Advanced City in the
World ISeries Ao 2axei.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sib:
In naming Glasgow, Scotland, as the most ad
vanced city in the world there is not the re
motest possibility that any one will challenge
the statement who has studied the subject of
municipal government long enough to become
familiar with the facts relating to it; and as
to the matter of running the government of
the City without an Assessor or Tax Collector,
the official announcement that tne income
from the public utilities owned by the city is
now sufficient to pay all expenses of the city
government and to provide far important puo
lic improvements after January 1, 1897, will
be sufficient to satisfy the most incredulous
person in San Francisco. And yet the city of
Glasgow does so many things for the general
welfare of the people, such as have never been
dreamed of in San Francisco, that few readers
of The Call can be prepared to beiieve it all
actually true, and they are therefore invited
to Investigate for themselves.
Hoping to encourage such investigation,
especially by the owners of large properties in
San Francisco, I name my sources of informa
tion, and will Add that it is impossible to con
dense a tube of what they will find so as to
put it into a brief communication for news
paper publication. In an octavo volume of
385 papes by Albert Shaw on "Municipal Gov
ernment in Great Britain," published by the
Century Company, New York, 1895, the
fourth chapter, containing seventy-five pages,
is entitled "A Study of Glasgow," which is
based on the official reports of that city, cov
ering a period of thirty years in particular,
and in general Including the entire history of
the city, and from thia volume and also from
the November number oi "Annals of the
American Academy of Political and Social
Science" I present the reader with the infor
mation which follows, and once more invite
him to read up on Glasgow, also on Man
chester, Birmingham and London.
On June 11, six months since, the city of
Glasgow celebrated the thirtieth anniversary
of the passage by the British Parlinment of
the "Glasgow Improvement Trust Act/ which
opened a new epoch in the history of the city,
says the "Annals of the American Academy."
But In 1854, twelve years previous, a number
of philanthropic citizens formed an associa
tion for the purpose of effecting some changes
in the unfortunate condition of the slum popu
lation, and this was in fact the beginning of
the reform movement which after years of
futile private endeavor resulted in the act of
Parliament which empowered the city as a
corporation to undertake the work which
philanthropy and private effort could not ac
complish. "It was natural that Glasgow
should take the lead," says the Annals, "as the
conditions there were probably worse than in
any other of the cities of Great Britain." It
was from this condition that Glasgow has
risen to the highest rank among the foremost
cities of the world.
In the space which remains I must deal with
results oniy. The slums districts are prac
tically eradicated. The city condemned the
disease-breeding tenements, bought up the
property of the slums districts, erected the
best modern sanitary bnildings several stories
high in place of the former hovels, with one,
two, three, four and five room apartments,
which the city rents to tenants at about $3, $4,
$7, $11 and $17 a month respectively, and
right In the center of the city, while the water
and ras rates which are paid to the city are
merely nominal and reduce the cost of living
to a minimum. The city now owns over 1000
of these "dwellings" or suites of rooms, and
houses over 6000 peeple, an average of six
persons in each. The income derived by the
city even at these low rates not only covers
the interest on the investment, the care of the
buildings and all needed repairs, but also is
gradually accumulating a sinking fund to ex
tinguish the debt incurred in the purchase of
the condemned property and in constructing
the new buildings.
The social, sanitary and financial success of
this work ol changing the slums into modern
scientific habitations emboldened the ciiy to
extend its operations to benefit another class
of unfortunate people, widows and widowers
with small children, who were obliged to go
out to work and had no one to take care of
their children. For these people they erected
a large and commodious building containing
175 bedroom*, a number of general common
rooms, nurseries, bathrooms, small kitchens
In which to prepare food for infants and re
creation rooms for the children. A number of
nurses taka charge of the children during the
entire day and the children enjoy themselves
in the open air instead of bsing, as formerly,
locked up in small rooms while tbe<r parents
were at work. With all this the charges are
very low and include light, heat, washing and
care of tne children, namely, for a mother
and one child 79 cents per week, or with two
children, 95^ cents; with three, $1, and 12J^
cents lor each additional child; for a father
and one chiid, $1 04 per week ; with two chil
dren, $1 21; with three, $1 37^, and 16 cents
for each additional child. Board is provided
for adults at 5 cents for breakfast, 8 cents for
dinner and 6 cents for supper, or 19 cents per
day. Thus a widow with three children can
live very comfortably for $3 38 per week and a
man wilh three children for $3 75.
â  But the end is not yet At the meeting of
the Town Council, June 18 last, a motion was
carried with but three dissonting voices out
of seventy-two members to apply to Parlia
ment for power to expropriate property for
Ihe express purpose of providing sanitary
modern dwellings for all the working classes.
And it is said that the excellent credit of tne
city, which Is able to borrow at 2}- 2 per cent,
will make the venture a financial success,
while the social and sanitary results will amply
compensate the city for the outlay. Years
ago the city established public washhousos,
where for 2 pence an hour a woman is al
lowed the use of a stall containing an im
proved steam-boiling apparatus and fixed tubs
with hot and cold water faucets, and her
washed clothes are placed in machine driers
for two minutes, then hung on sliding frames
which enter a hot-air department, and are
ready for a large roller-mangle operated by
steampower, and thus she may go home at the
end of an hour with her clothes washed, dried
and ironed.
But time and space will not permit me to
tell the reader of the city farm, city markets,
dairies, public baths, the libraries, public
scientific schools, the parks and many other
things of like character, or of the immense
advantage to the City iv the reduction of the
cost of service to the public which comes from
the public ownership of the lighting plants,
the streetcars, the water works, the wnrkets
and other public utilities, from which also the
entire revenue of the city is derived, at the
snme time increasing the pay and shortening
the hours of service of the public employes,
and I must close with the story but half told.

SUGAR BOUNTIES.
IMPORTANCE OF FOSTERING BCGAB PRODUCTION
IN THE tOUNTBT.
Chicago later Ocean.
An Hem of news irom 1 Mauritius states that
the sugar-planters of that island have decided
to loin with those of the British West Indies in
representations to the Government of Great
Britain regarding /â  the sugar bounties paid by
foreign countries. The object in view is to
secure : some counter-action to enable them to
compete more fairly wilh their foreign rivals.
' Tha fact of it is that sugar raising is on a
radically different : footing : from any other
branch of agriculture. ' It was just about as
the present century was. born that the feasi
bility of producing beet sugar was discovered
and the genius of . Napoleon i saw the inter
national importance ol this rival- to cane
Miear - He put a premium, in the form of a
Government bounty. on raining beets ior*ugar,
and that . was adopted by .he other < great
nations of Continental Europe and is in vogue
l Vora?ong time cane-raisers did not suffer
from this competition, but at last it has i be-,
come almost destructive. If beet-raising
Europe hold to the bounty policy and cane
raising countries do not do the same the in
evitable result will be to very nearly destroy
the raising of cane. The Mauritians are justi
fied in their demand and Great Britain must
come to the rescue or see that branch ol agri
culture wither away, v- / - :: V ' -â¢-â¢â"
The latest available estimate of sugar pro
duction gives the total per year a*: Beet,
3 841000 metric tons, cane 2,900,000 metric
ion*. The metric ton is 2204.6 pounds, almost
the same as our long ton of 2240 pounds. Of
this yield Mauritius is credited with 125,000
tons, the United States 205,000 tous, the same
as the Philippine islands. There are no less
than eighteen countries i in the list of cane
producers. The four great nations of Conti
nental Kurope, Germany, Austria-Hungary,
France and Russia alone produced Just about
the amount of beet sugar as all the res* of the
world does of cane sugar, and they axe bounty,
countries. - â¢ . _, .â  ,
The United States has the distinction, so
vast is our area, of being adapted to the rais
ing of both sugar beet and cane. If it were
not for the competition of bounty-encouraged
beet sugar wÂ« would soon raise all our own
sugar. Or, if our country would steadily off
set the bounty advantage of European beet
raisers by a counter bounty on home produc
! tion, the same result would soon be attained.
Nearly all the cane sugar of commerce is pro
duced In the New World,' especially the tropi
cal islands, and if the Governments of those
islands and mainlands would join the United
States in a kind of zollverein, all pooling in to
protect their sugar interests, they could soon
break up the bounty system, tor, in that case,
the beet-raising countries of Europe would
find the object of their bounty policy defeated.
It is probable that they would be willing then
to cry quits. Germany alone produces 1,350,
-000 metric tons, nearly one-fifth the total an
nual sugar product of the world.
The United States has the soil and climate to
compete, and under the McKinley act was be
ginning to be a formidable rival, but the Wil
son law took off the bounty without making
provision for any sort of offset The next Con
gress should either restore the bounty or put
a tariff on- Importation from bounty-paying
countries high enough to be an offset to those
bounties. . y , <)pU<yKIISMSC^9m^iWBSBIBK9HQI
The United States is the great sugar-eating
country oi the world. Our consumption of it
has considerably more than doubted per cap
ita since the war. The average annual amount
of sugar consumed by each person in this
country Is nearer seventy than sixty pounds,
If the money spent for sugar could all be.kept
at home it would make a great difference with
our balance of trade. At 2 cents a pound this
exceeds $100,000,000 a y*ar. Surely the Wil
son | law, viewed simply from this one saccha
rine point .of view, was a great National ca
lamity. ' â¢-' - . â¢- â¢'â¢â¢'â¢â '- â 
ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
Mothkr Shiptonâ K. 8., Alvarado, Aiameda
County, Cal. Mother Shipton was a prophetess
who is said to have lived from 1486 to 1561.
She was known in South Wales and at one
time her predictions, generally in rhyme, were
in everybody's mouth in South Wales, espe
cially in Glamorganshire. She predicted the
death of Wolsey, Lord Percy and others, and
during the reign of Henry VIII she gained lo
cal fame in Yorkshire for her prophecies. In
1862 there was published by Charles Hindley
oi Brighton, Ens., what purported to be an ex
act reprint of "A Chap Book Version of Mother
shipton's Prophecies, from the edition of
1448." The most noteworthy prophecy was
the following:
Cnrr ages without horses shall go,
And accidents shall flu the world with woe,
Around the world thoughts shall fly
In the twinkling of an eye.
Waters snail yet. more wonders do,
Now strange, yet shall be true.
The world upside down shall be.
And gold be found at roof's tree,'
Through bills man shall ride
And no horse nor ass be at his side.
Vnder water man shall walk,
Shall ride, shall sleep, shall talk.
Id : he air man shall be seen.
In whltÂ«, in black, in green.
Iron in the water shall float
As eaiy as a wooden boat.
Gold shall be found 'mid stone
In a land that's now unknown.
Fire and water shall wonders do.
England shall ac laÂ«t admit a Jew.
And this world to an end shall come
In eighteen hundred and eighty-one.
As the year announcing the end of the world
drew nigh, this so-called prophecy attracted a
great deal of attention, and the world was
anxious to know something about Mother
Shipton. In 1880 there appeared the follow
ing in a Chicago paper, contributed by a cor
respondent:
I would like to give your readers an abstract of
the researches of William Killaway. In the
library of the British Museum there are nineteen
or t wenty prints or reprln.s, ranging in size from
duodecimo to quarto, giving an account of Ursula
seathiely, alias Mother Shipton, born, It is said,
in Knorts borough, near tho Dropping Well, ami
burled near Clifion. over her head was raised a
stone, on which was engraved the following
epitaph :
Here lies one who never Iy'd,
Whose skill so often has been try'd;
Whose prophecies shall still survive,
And keep her uan.e alive.
This is said by R. Head, who wrote her life
in 1687, to have been found in an old monas
tery. Mr. Head searched the old works, but
failed to find the prophecy there.
Another correspondent to the same paper
wrote as follows:
Mother Shipton was a veritable character who
lived more than three hundred years ago and ut
tered a number of so-called prophecies. They
were for the most part a vague, unmeaning Jum
ble, and were without point or meaning. In Hind
ley's reprint "The Prophecy" appeared, and In It
wero many modern discoveries and Inventions,
such as "Carriages without horses shall go," which
has been realized In railroads, and the prophecy
wound up with the lines:
"The world to an end shall come
In eighteen hundred and eighty-one."
The prophecy was copied into a New* York paper
and dec ared to be a for j try. An English paper
declared that it was an exact reprint or the out
edition for nearly 250 years on file in the Britinh
Museum. The New Yorlc paper sent its English
correspondent to look the matter up. He found
the old prophecies to be a jumble of local predic
tions that might have b-seu fulfilled at any and
every decade since their data. None of the poimed
undlnterestlngpredictionsln the new Issue wereln
the old book, and they were evidently written after
the occurrence of the events they are supposed to
predict. In the spring of 1873 lllndley wrote a
letter confessing that he had fabricated the proph
tcy quoted and several others in order to make
tna booK salable.
One of Mother Shipton 's prophecies was that
"When the dragon of Bow Church and the
grasshopper of the Royal Exchange should
meet London streets would be deluged with
blood." In 1820 both these vanes were lying
together in the yard of a stonemason in Old
street road, but the prophecy was not fulfilled.
THETECHE-i-"Wildwood," Cal. There is no
river Teche, but there is the Bayou Teche, one
oi the small tidewater navigable channels
which were once the main channels of large
rivers. This bayou lies immediately west of
Grand Lake in the southern part of the State
of Louisiana, and the Atcharalaya River, and
its huge banks formed by the overflows cen
turies ago when it was a main iiver outlet
Thebnyou Is through one of the most fertile
and productive portions of the State It is
navigable to St. Martlnsville, Martin County
about 100 miles above its mouth, where It
empties into the Lower Atchafalaya, near Mor
gan City, in St. Mary's County. Above St. Mar
tinsville the Teche is navigable for very small
boats a portion of the year. What is now
termed Bayou Teche was once the lower por
tion of the ancient channel of Red River, ex
tending from the present bayou to a point east
of OpelouÂ»Â«s in St. Landry County around to
the west and south of what is now the great
lake basinâ then probably an inland bay into
which the Mississippi dischargedâ to the Rulf
of Mexico. St. Martinsville, Pattersonville,
Centerville, Franklin and New Iberia are
prominent towns on the Teche.
ThÂ» Mound-Buildersâ "Wild wood," Cal. It
Is generally believed that the Mississippi
Valley and the Atlantic Coast were once in
habited by an agricultural and partially civil
ized race quite different from the nomadic
Indians, though possibly the progenitors of
some oi the Indian tribes, and that after cen
turies of occupation they disappeared, per
haps many thousand years before the advent
of Europeans. The theory has been advanced
that these people migrated from Asia, that
they passed over Asia to Siberia, across Bering
Straits, down the Pacific Coast of America
irom Alaska and to the Mississippi Valley
and do'vn to Mexico, Central America and
Peru. The remnins of the mound-builders,
as this vanished people are called, are
scattered over most of the States of
the central and lower Mississippi Valley,
along the banks of the Missouri and
on the sources of the Alleghany. They are
most numerous iÂ» Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,
Wisconsin, Missouri, Arkansas. Kentucky,
Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia,
Florida and Texas, and are found in the west
ern part of New York and in Michigan and
lowa. The mounds vary greatly la size, in
some instances being very extensive Ind very
intricate, notably those of the Licking Valley
near Newark, Ohio, which cover an area of
two square miles. In some other localities
there are some wjrtch reach a height of ninety
ieet. it i R believed that these people did not
have a written language, as no Inscriptions or
tablets have been discovered to indicate this.
Many of tne mounds have been found to con
tain skeletons, numerous implements and or
naments, usually composed of stone, some
times of copper in its native state, and occa
sionally she.l and bone; also coarse and rude
pottery of curious design. In substantiation
lhftt the c?^ PfÂ°P'e came from Asia is the fact
that in Siberia mounds similar to those iv the
Mississippi Valley have been discovered.
To Eat Crow-W. f., city. The following is
given as to the origin of the saying "To eat
crow." During the Civil War or shortly after
its close, a United States soldier snot a tame
crow, the owner of which came upon him be
fore he had time to reload his pitc*. and com
pelled him to eat a mouthful of ihe bird. This
satisfied the owner of the bird, who waited
away, but before he had gone a great distance
he was overhauled by the eoldler, who had
loaded up again, and compelled him to return
and eat a mouthful or two of the crow. The
owner, the next day, complained at tho post.
The commander sent for the soldier com
plained of and asked him. "Do you know this
gentleman?" The soldier drawled out, "Va-asj
we dined together yosterdHy." In every-day
conversation "to eat crow" is understood to
mean that an individual takes back nil he
previously said in regard to a certain matter.
Women and Poixtaxâ B., Counts Precinct,
Cal. If the amendment to allow women to
vote had carried at the late election it would
not have carried with it the imposition of a
polltax on the women of the State of Califor
nia. The constitution of the State says: "ThÂ«Â»
Legislature shall provide for the levy and col
lection of an annual polltax of not less than
fp2 on every male inhabitant of this State, over
'21 and under 60 years of age, except paupers.
Idiots, Insane persons and Indians not taxed."
That is section 12 of article XIII, and as it \
did not come up for amendment by striking A
out the word "male" the women would not â 
come within its provisions. F
Not Eligibleâ B., Counts Precinct, Cal. A
mail carrier or ganger in the employ of the
Internal Kevenne Department would not be
eligible to serve as an officer of election in any
precinct in the State of California, under the
provisions of the following, from the law of
1895 : "No person shall be eligible to act as an
officer of election at any precinct who has beeu
employed in any official capacity in the county,
city and county in the State within ninety
days next preceding any election. A person
cannot be a mail-carrier or United States
ganger without being employed in an official
capacity.
Schoolsâ D. P. M. 8., Frultvale, Aiameda
County, Cal. German is not taught at the
Polythechnic High School, but bookkeeping,
shorthand and typewriting are, and alt the
branches named are taught at the Ccgsuell
School. Applicants must have attained a car
tain standing before being admitted. By ad
dressing the principal of each school yon can
obtain a circular that will give all tne infor
mation desired.
Thk City Hallâ J. W., City. The corner
stone of the City Hall wan laid on the 22d of
February, 1872. The City Hall Commissioners
at that lime were t. H. Cannavan, Joseph O.
Eastlaud and Cuarles E. McLane, ail since de
ceased, and the Mayor of tho City was William
Alvord, at present president of the Bank of
California.
Mint Employesâ Subscriber, City. The em
ployes of the San Francisco branch mint have
been placed within the civil service Tules
since the 6th of last May, but as yet none of
them hare undergone civil service examina
tion.
Gas Balloonâ C. H. 8., City. The balloons
sent up from the chutes are not gas balloons,
but hot air ones. Bo license or permit Is re
quired to send up such.
SEW TO-PAT.
Economy is promoted
by the use of Royal *<
Baking Powder to the
exclusion of all other
leavening agents. The
official analysts report
it to be 33% greater in
Jeavening strength than
the other powders. It
has four times the leav-
ening strength of many
of the cheap alum
powders.
Royal never fails to
make good bread, bis-
cuit and cake, so that
there is no flour, eggs
or butter spoiled anci
wasted in heavy, sour
and uneatable food. It
never makes food that
is unwholesome. Its
use is a guarantee from
the danger of alum and
lime which are present
in the low-grade cheap
powders.
Do dealers attempt,
because times are dull,
to work off old stock,
or low-grade brands of
baking powder? De-
cline to buy them.
During these times all
desire to be economi-
cal, and Royal is the I
most economical as <
well as the most whole-
some baking powder.

ANOTHER FLEET
OFF THE HEADS
Vessels Coining and Going
in a Constant
Stream.
Whalers, Coasters and Deep"
Water Ships Were All
Bunched.
Unusually Lerge Shipments of Flour
Being Made to Australia and
Oriental Ports.
Another big fleet of coasters and deep
water ships went to sea yesterday.
Among- the number were the Charles W.
Morgan and the California, the last of the
whaling fleet to leave before next March.
The British ship Kifburn and the Ameri
can bars Mohican also went out, while
several suj;ar boats from tie islands got
in, and in consequence the offing was kept
dotted with sails all day long.
At one time durinc the early aiternoon
the whaling bark California, the British
Bliip Kelburn, loaded with wheat for
Ipswich, England, and the bark Mohican
for Honolulu were close together and all
making sail. The old whaler was last
but nevertheless she got sail on in very
quick order and was not so very far be
hind the clippers when they sank under
the horizon.
The barkentines Irmgard and W. H.
Dimond both got in from Hawaii yester
day. The Irmgard was off Point Arena
last Sunday, and Captain Schrritt fully
expected to reach port Sunday night or
Monday morning. At one time he saw in
tiie distance a four-masted ship, two
square riggers and a British bark. The
latter he took to be the Anglesey, now out
ninety days from Newcastle, Australia.
The latter vessel was chartered at a high
rate to load wheat for Europe, but the
chartering party expired a couple of days
ago. Captain Lewis will now have to
accept a 35 per cent reduction in order to
secure a load for his vessel.
The W. H. Dimond was off the heads
at 10 o'clock last night, but could not
make port. She left Hawaii a day after
the Irmgard, and the latter only got in a
few hours ahead. Both vessels encoun
tered light baffling winds off the coast.
â¢ There was a small tire in the iazarette of
the schooner Mary Dodge yesterday. She
Is su.ar-iaden and for several days has
been lying in : Mission Bay awaiting a
chance to dock at the sugar refinery.
Early In the morning the fire was discov
ered and a boat's crew sent ashore to call
assistance. The fire was put out by a
bucket brigade, however, and the damage
will not exceed $100. \ -.^
The British ship Marlborough Hill is
now out 131 days from a small Central
American port for Tacoma and no word
has teen beard from her. The under
writers are getting uneasy and yesterday
10 per cent reinsurance was paid on the
vessel.
The schooner Golden Gate has been laid
up in Oakland Creek for nearly a year and
Captain Johnson has become tired waiting
for another trip. A few days ago he bought
out Captain Peterson's interests in the
Compeer and will go out as master of that
vessel when she sails for Central America.
Captain Peterson has been appointed to
the command of the J. M. Wetherwax.
The Harbor Commissioners decided yes
terday to repile Broadway wharf on the
recommennation of Chief Engineer
Holmes. It was at first intended to pat
in ordinary piles, but when President
Colnon pointed out that if they were
creosoted they could be used a*gain when
the wharf was -pulled down and rebuilt'
next year it was decided to use creosoted
piles. When rebuilt the construction will
be the same as that of the Pacific and
Folsom street wharves.
The Lancing is loading for Sydney and
among her cargo will be 2000 tons of flonr.
The Andelana will also take 2500 tons for
the same port, and altogether there is
from 50,000 to 60.0QP barrel* in sight for
immediate shipment to Australia.
The first shipment of brick for the new
ferry depot will come down from the San
.loaquin Brick Company on the Undine.
It will arrive to-morrow.
The California Navigation and Improve
ment Company is building two new
barges, to cost $10,000 each, for the river
trade. This is due to the extra demand
made upon the company's efficient ser
vice by the increase in the carrying busi
ness of the Valley road.
FAIR DID NOT SHOOT,
The Male Heir to the Hg Estate Meets
Blr. Delmni in a Notary's OfÃco
and Is Very Mild.
Charles Fair and D. M. Delmas came face
to face yesterday morning in the office of
Notary Phillips, room 90, in the Crocker
building.
The occasion was the taking of the depo
sition of Mr. Fair in the suit of Cnldwell
to recover the package of letters written
by Senator Fair to the plaintiff and which
he alleges were secured from him by Mr.
Fair through misrepresentation. The
deposition was not taken, being postponed
for a week at the request of Mr. Fair, but
one purpose of the citation was served.
Mr. Fair appeared and submitted himself
to the jurisdiction of the notary like any
other peaceable and law-abiding citizen.
That he would do so was a question in
doubt, made so by Mr. Fair himself.
It has been the common gossip of the
street lately how Mr. Fair has been swear
ing all Borts of dire things against Mr.
Delmas. It hns been declared that Mr.
Fair bad certain vengeances to wreak
against Mr. Delmas because of his activity
in behalf of his client, Mrs. Craven, and
against the Fair heirs or the Fair estate,
and that at his (Mr. Fair's) first meeting
with Mr. Delmas he designed to shed hia
(Mr. Delmas') blood. So when Mr. Fair
was called to meet Mr. Delmas within tbo
limitations of a notary's office some little
interest was felt in the incident by the
friends of the one and the other.
Butit was all very mild. Mr. Delmas and
the notary were on hand at 10 o'clock,
neither of them being armed so tar as ap
peared. Mr. Fair, accompanied Dy his at
torney, Charles Hettgerty, also reported
on time, and Mr. Heggerty, on behalf of
his client, asked that the matter go over
until December 12, which request Mr.
Delmas granted, not wishing to cause any
unnecessary inconvenience to Mr. Fair.
No exhibition of ill temper even marred
the meeting, the party, apparently in the
best of humor, descending the elevator to
gether.

OPENING OF THE
PICTURE SHOW
Winter Exhibition Inaugu
rated at the Hopkins
Institute.
Many Examples of Clever Work
From Studios of the Pacific
Coast.
Features of the Reception to Members
Only at the Big House on
Nob Hill.
Lovers of art, devotees of fashion and
representatives of the social and com
mercial world made up the audience that
assembled by express invitation to attend
the opening of the winter exhibition at
the Hopkins Institute of Art last evening.
To see the pictures, to admire and to
criticise was the primary intention of the
throng. There was little lolling in the
gallery, cosy tete-a-tete nooks found no
tenants and the ever watchful chaperon
used her lorgnettes for the paintings
alone.
In Secretary Martin's office the artists
assembled, and toasting their toes before
the bright grate fire, discussedâ the light.
Jonllin acted as master of ceremonies.
His brothers of the brush approached him
with reverence and awe while he conde
scendingly discoursed of uppercuts and
other scientific teims of the arena.
"Times are not hard," said Joullin.
"There was $25,000 m the Mechanic's
Pavilion on Tuesday night. But try to
sell a sketch for $10 â " and all the artists
sighed in chorus with a sigh that would
have put the best regjiiated furnace to
shame.
.As usual the ladies lent the necessary
bright-color touch. Their gowns were
thoss that are invariably described as
creations. And the bonnets â well they
were of the kind that the theatrical man
ager so discourteously requests to be left
in the dressing-room.
The ultra-smart set â the buds who are to
blossom at the cotillon this evening, the
belles of the past and the mafon whose
dancing days are not yet over â they were
conspicuous by their absence.
The beaux found representatives in
Horace Platt, always smiling and polite,
Addison Mizner and Walter Martin.
Moving in the gaily dressed throng, now
dodging behind gorgeous plumes and
flashing rhiuestones, where a few plebian
sailor hats. Their owners stood in wrapt
admiration before landscapes and figures,
oblivious of their surroundings, absorbed
by the pictures and by the world forgot.
On tbÂ« ground floor tables were spread
and punch, icecream, coffee, tea and
chocolate were offered to the guests. But
the crowd at Hopkins' last evening was
not a crowd that cared much for refresh
ments. Not more than half of those pres
ent visited the refreshment hall and not
one paid the tables the honor of a seconu
call. It was a throng that was neither
thirsty nor hungry, a throng that came
early and did not stay late.
On the reception committee were Horace
G. Platt, Edward Bosqui, L. P. Latiraer
J. C. Johnson, W. G. Stafford. J. R. Mar
tin, James D. Pheian, Charles R. Bishop,
Irving M. Scott, Arthur Rodgers, Henry
Heyraan and Joseph D. Grant.
Among the many present were:

Marcus L. Gentle. Miss Holt, Miss Chandler,
Mrs. A. H. Barendt, Mrs. Joseph Marks, Miss
Gallager, Miss T. Eastman. Mr. and Mrs. '
Greene and Mrs. Sidney M. Smith.
The artists manifest more than usual
interest in the display, as the exhibition
marks a departure from time-honored
customs of the Art Association. The work
of local artists is now displayed in the
winter collection in order that theron
tributors may get the advantage of the
holiday demand for pictures.
Artists have good cause to congratulate
themselves on the excellence of the ex
amples exhibited. The pictures repiesent
the coior and life of Pacific Coast subjects.
Much of the scenery is of mountain, glen,
forest, field and seashore of California.
To institute comparisons with former
displays or note deviations it may be saul
that a tendency to figure-painting is dis
cernible. A striving to produce startling
impressions is not evident. The artists
have not gone out of their way to imitate
Beardsley. Gibson girls are not brought
into prominence. In short, there is little
of the freakish or sensational in the exhi
bition. Many of the pictures are little
gems of merit â bits of landscape worthy
of study on their lights and shadows. The
color of California scenery is everywhere
dominant.
In the main gallery on the line Thomas
Hill has four examples, namely: "April
Showers," sketch from nature; "Sunset on
the Foothills," cattle; "Evening in the
Pathless Woods"; "Morning in the Foot
hills," cattle.
William Keith exhibits several pic
tures â "Summer. Hills Above Niles Can
yon," "An Old Qaberiunzie," "A Forest
Veteran in the Redwoods," "Autumn
Twilight" and "Springtime."
J. A. Stanton is represented by the
"Coming Storm," "Waiting for the
Boats," "Low Tide" and "Gathering
Glams."
CD. Robinson's marine, "The Dying
Gale, Farallones," is a clear and effective
piece of work. It is in the conservatory.
Elizabeth Strong is creditably repre
sented. The examples from her stiuiio
are: "The Stranger," "Fuss" and "Kit
tens." J. D. Strontr exhibits a portrait.
A. Joullin'B sanddunes are worthy of
study; "On the Trail" is a meritorious
piece o! work; "Chinatown Shop" â a
atU'iy â gains attention.
"Glenwood Grapes" is the title of a
pleasine picture painted by Mary T.
Menton.
H. S. Fonda's painting, ".Reveries,"
Finisterre, France, was in the salon last
year. The catalogue number is twenty
eignt, in the mail gallery.
The exhibition is enriched by some pic
tures of merit from Charles Rollo Peters'
studio, Monterey. "Sunset Glow Amongst
the Sanddunes" is the title of one picture.
"Near St. Cheron" and "Fontainebleau'
are examples of excellent work by E. M.
Pissis. "A Severe Criticism," by C. C.
Judson, will attract much more than pass
ing notice.
The "Sketch of an Old House," by
Amanda Austin possesses merit.
R. D.. Yelland, J. H. E. Partington,
Helen Hyde, C. C. Judson, Oscar Kunath,
Molly Hutchinson, Sarah E. Bender,
Louise M. Carpenter, L. P. Latimer and
many other artists of note are represented.

DARE BURGLARS
BUSILY AT WORK
Two Places Entered Close
to the New City
Hall.
One a Saloon Opposite the En
trance to the Central
Police Station.
The Police Are Making Every Effort
to Capture the M' n, Who
Seem to Defy Them.
One of the most daring burglaries that
has probably ever been perpetrated in the
City Is being investigated by the police
with small chance of finding the culprits.
The daring part of the burglary lies in
the fact that it was committed in a saloon
on the corner oi Asn avenue and Larkin
street, the entrance to which is directly
opposite the entrance to the Central police
station.
The saloon Is occupied by Henry Peard,
who lives in the upper flat with his wife
and family.
Tuesday morning when Peard opened
the saloon he sawatpnee that during the
night it had been visited by burglars. The
cash register had been forced open, but
the burglars met with a disappointment,
as Peard is careful to remove all the money
from it every night on closing. No attempt
had apparently been made to force open the
safe, probably from the fear that the noise
nuirht attract the attention of the police
men on duty at the Central station.
The cigars bad been carefully sampled
and a box of the finest brand was selected
and carried away. How many bottles of
liquor were stolen is not known.
The police were at once notified and an
Investigation showed that an entrance had
been effected by the rear door. A gate
leads into the rear from Ash avenue, and
it was an easy matter to force it open. A
hole was cut in the door ciose to the bolt
and lar^e enough to permit a man's band
and wrist to pass through and slide the
bolt back.
The burglary caused the greatest con
sternation at the Central police station,
as it was committed right under the noses
of the police, and showed an utter con
tempt for the force ou the part of the
burglars. It is this fact that is spurring
on the detectives in their efforts to dis
cover the identity of the burglars.
The burglars are believed to be the same
men who broke into Kibbler's drugstore,
Turk and Larkin streets, about a week
ago.
They climbed the fence in the rear on
Turk street and obtained an entrance by
cutting a hole in the rear door, just as
they did at Peard's saloon. They took
about $10 and a pair of opera-glasses from
a desk which they forced open with a
"jimmy."
The police think that the burglars be
ion: to the neighborhood, and they are
working on that theory.
BATTLESHIP TARS
HAVE A GAY TIME
The Invitation Ball of
the Oregon's Blue-
Jackets.
First Event of the Sort Was
Decidedly a Conspicuous
Success.
Among the Toasts at the Banquat
Was One to Gallant "Jack, the
Nan Behind the Gun."
There was a great event at Odd Fellows'
Hall last evening. The boys in blue ol the
United States battleship Oregon gave
their first invitation ball, and it was a
"corker." The attendance embraced
many of the officers, prominent among
whom was Commander Howison and
Lieutenant-Commander F. J. Drake, the
executive officers of the ship, who did
much to promote the event and to help
the blue jackets to have a good time. The
officers and ladies were spectators. They
gazed upon a scene of jollity.
The red-coated band from Mare Island,
gorgeous in all their full-dress trappings,
loomed up on the stage. All around the
musicians were potted plants. Over tlielr
heads was the name of the Oregon in large
gilt letters. Draperies of bunting bright
ened up the galleries and hung in festoons.
The bluejuckets were in uniform. They
had many invited guests.
Shortly after 9 o'clock the grand march
came off, which was led by R. H. Small,
chief machinist of the battleship, with
j Miss Horn. The second couple were Chief
Quartermaster G. Johnson and Miss Staid.
The dancing programme waÂ« dedicated
throughout, the grand march and lancers
being dedicated to the commander, the
waltz to the executive officers, and so on,
the admiral, the guests, the United btfttes

FIGHT A DUEL
FOR A MAIDEN
Two Mexicans Go Forth
to Battle and One Is
Missing.
His Foe Ambushed and Driven
Back, but Only for a
Time.
Believed to Have Returned and Ended
Their Rivalry by Assassi
nation.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Dec. 3.â Luis Rosas,
a miner of Calmalli, Mexico, 300 miles
â  south of this city, arrived to-day with a
story of a Mexican duel and the probable
ambush and murder of one of the princi
pals, Chito Balderes, by Ignacio Lopez.
They were friends until recently, when
they quarreled over a woiuan whom both
â  loved. They drew knives one night at
â¢ '..Rosa's house, but were separated. Lopez
" .. threatened to kill Balderes on sight.
â¢. The following morning Lopez appeared
. with a rifle and signified his intention of
...going after Balderes. He struck out
-. toward the placer claim, formerly worked
.'â  by them in partnership, but instead of
; ; finding him there he met with a warm re
â¢ â¢ ception in the shape of a shot from behind
.some boulders on the side hill. Balderes
â *Â« had evidently seen him approaching and
â 'â  ': .meant to have the first chance. Lopez
': .'was not struck by the ball and he hur
:"'â¢ riedly got oat of sight at a turn in the
â¢ : Vtrarl.
; ' .'-.- He could not see his enemy so as to re
â¢; 'tdr,n the shot, but he waited several hours
j.. ' -for him to appear. When he did see him
â¢ : -...Â«dÂ«ins: away through the brush he sent
-, Va .ball after him and made up his mind to
. ;ke*p on his trail.
;,: ;. â  For seven or eight hours, as he after
';â¢.'ward said, he followed Balderes through
â¢â¢/brash and over the rough country in the
. ..jdfrection of San Francisquito, but could i
.:: -.not eet sight of him, although on one or
:â :â¢" two occasions the men were within IOC
: ;.-yaEds of each other. When darkness
: Icame on, Lopez, so he claims, gave up the
. "â¢trail and made his way back to Camp AJe
â¢'V.men. The next day he tooK possession of
.:' "the-pkicer claim and said it was his iuten
' . -tidn <o hold it.
.". . Balderes has failed to return. Lopez
â¢' 'jdpesnot appear to be afraid of the return j
;./-of. his enemy, and some of his acquaint
= â¢ -a'nees have t-xpressed the belief that he
'. .overtook Balderes and killed him.
STEAMERS TO THE ORIENT.
San Diego Business Mn Consider a
Proposition tor the Operation of
' 'â  a Mew Line.
BAN DIEGO, Cal., Dec. 3.â A confer
. enc. between E. C. Potter of Chicago and
A. .11. Butler of Japan on one side and
| a delegation of San Diego citizens on the
-oihep took place to-night at Hotel del
Coronado, relative to the proposed Ameri
can steampbip company to be organized
-..to, operate steamships between San Diego
â¢and Yokohama viÂ» Honolulu.
.The subject was discussed extensively
â¢in a general way and the main points of
"..'the- proposition laid before the San
.Diegans. Mr. Potter said he did not care
â¢to erlter into it fully until the appointment
. "of committees of San Diego and Loa An
ecles business men duly authorized to act
1 lor their respective cities.
Then, he said, he was ready for business !
and was prepared to secure cash sufficient
;.to build the finest steamships on the
I Pacific, of twenty-knot speed, and, work
ing in connection with the Santa Fe Rail
road*, to make the quickest oassage be
tween New York and Chicago and the
Orient.
To make the proposition a success cer
tain things are required of San Diego and
Los Angeles, and in an informal way the
. Bap Diego representatives promised that
â  the requirements would be met.
It is "understood these requirements con
sist of subscriptions to $500,000 of stock in
.the new company, which will have a capi
, tal stock of $5,000,000, mostly owned by
capitalists of Chicago and New York,
anrong them Benjamin P. Cheney. E. P.
Kipley, E. C. Potter, A. F. Walker and
others intimately connected with the
' Santa Fe Railroad.
The result of the conference was an ar
rangement to meet to-morrow morning at
ih'e Chamber of Commerce to appoint a
committee to go to Los Angeles in the !
.afternoon with Messrs. Potter and Butler,
: there to join a similar committee of Los
Angeles busineas men.
â¢ A meeting of the two committees and
the steamship men will be held on Satur- '
day night, at which the two sides will get !
down to business.
Wrnt Down. With the Sloop.
â¢ SAN DIEGO, Cal., Dec. 3.â The first
positive evidence that the sloop Meta had
been lost and Frank Morrison and Frank
' Green drowned was the finding this morn
ing of a fish box belonging to the vessel.
â â¢ It had been washed up at Pacific Beach,
eight miles north of the city. The Meta
Jeft here the day after election for a cruise
of two days and was never seen afterward.
They had been on a fishing trip.
MISSION SANTA BARBARA'S LOSS.
Death of Rev. Father Fox, a Priest Whose
Hand Was Ever Lifted to Aid
Others.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Dec. 3.â The
lolling of the Misbion bells last night told
the citizens of Santa Barbara that the
grim messengerâ Deathâ had entered that
sacred edifice and claimed a holy man as
its victim.
The soul of the Reverend Father Fox
had passed to the beyond. Father Fox
hnd been in poor health for some time,
and for days past his death was mo
mentarily expected by the other brothers
of the order, who were with him alter
nately day and night until he breathed
his last.
They are still with his body, as it lies in
a simple casKet in the Mission r>arlor, un
adorned by flowers, porap or splendor, or
aught but a crucifix and blessed candles.
Father Fox, or Father Bonaventure, as
be was known in religion, died as he had
lived, perfectly resigned to the inevitable
and at peace with his Creator.
He was not only a Catholic in religion,
but Catholic in everything, as those who
have had occasion tovisit the Old Mission
from business or curiosity can well attes 1 .
He knew no master but God, no religion
but charity and was always ready to ex
tend a helping hand to the poor and
afflicted.
He has been connected with the Santa
Barbara Mission for nearly forty years
and many a native son, Indian or Cauca-
Bian, owes his early tuition to the departed
priest.
Father Fox was a native of Ireland
where he studied for the priesthood in his
early youth, coming to America when he
was but 19 years old. Wiien he died he
was 59 years oi age.
A requiem mass will be offered up at
the mission at 9 a. m. Saturday, at which
time the funeral will take place. The re
mains will be interred in a vanlt at the
mission. The only surviving relative he
left is a sister at Los Angeles, who is one
of the Sainted Brides of God.
LOS ANGELES CAPTURE.
Officers Apprehend One of the Men Who
Looted Mailboxes in Pasa
dena.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Dec. 3.â A very
clever bit of detective work by the Sheriff's
force here resulted in the arrest of John
Fushia, wdo purloined the mail from al
most every box in Pasadena on the night
of November 19 last. Fushia had an ac
complice in George Ray, a late arrival
from Kansas City.
The morning after the robberies Post
office Inspector Flint conferred with Sher-
iff Burr, and as a result Under Sheriff
Clement and Deputy Marshall were sent
to Pasadena, where they made a thorough
investigation.
Fushia rooms in a First-street lodging
house in tnis city and it was found that
Ray had been there with him. They se
cured a lar?e amount of mail from the
boxes, including several checks.
They found that a plumbing-shop had
been broken into and some tools stolen,
with which the mail boxes might have
been broken open. Later it was found
that on the evening of the mail-box rob
bery Fushia and Ray had been playing
pool together.
They attempted to pay for their livery
rig, which conveyed them to Pasa<iena,
with one of the checks, but the astute liv
eryman refused ttie offer.
They went to a clothing-store here and
bargained for a suit of clothes. Ray of
fered in payment the same cliecK, saying
he had been working in Pasadena and
had just been paid. Tne merchant asked
him to step around to the bank and Ray
went with him readily.
The bank telephoned to Pasadena and
was informed that such a check was out.
The bank officials were not satisfied, how
ever, and telephoned to the police. Ray
grew uneasy and disappeared, never again
appearing for the check.
It seems now that the partner has
escaped, and a complaint was filed in the
United States Court charging Fushia with
the crime.
REFORMERS ARE ACTIVE.

Mil Cause Arrests.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Dec. 3.â The re
form movement of the Ministerial Associa
tion has now assumed tangible shape and
is causing a good deal of apprehension in

character of tenants or the uses to which
their buildings nave been put.
A large number of complaints are
promised for to-morrow as a result of a re
port to the general body of the association
by its committee on violation of law.
It said that evidence has been secured

WANT COOPER
IN THE CABINET
California Fruit- Growers
Indorse the Santa Bar
bara Man.
Urge His Appointment by Major
McKinley as Secretary of
Agriculture.
The State Convention Favors the Im
portation of Pest-Destroying
Insects.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Dec. 3.â At the
forenoon meeting of the third day's ses
sion of the California Fruit-growers ex-
Senator William Johnston introduced a
resolution reciting that as California was
a great fruit-producing State it ought to
be represented in the Cabinet and indors
j ing . President Ellwood Cooper of Santa
| Barbara County for Secretary of Agricul-
I ture. It was unanimously adopted.
A resolution was also adopted calling
upon Congress to take immediate steps to
ward the construction of tne Nicaragua
canal and ordering the resolution trans
mitted to Congress by the secretary of the
State Board of Horticulture.
The committee on the president's ad
dress reported indorsing the president's
suggestion that pest-destroying parasites
be imported, and suggested that the
Legislature be asked for an appropriation
of $5000 per annum for the purpose to
be used by the State Board of Horticul
ture and |5000 per annum to help the
board carry on its work. The report was
unanimously adopted.
An essay on "Peach-tree Borers" by
Alexander Craw was read by the secre
tary. This paper stated that this insect
was one of the most disastrous enemies of
the fruit-grower. An effort must be made
to prevent the larvae being deposited on
the trees. Sulphur and lime was the best
remedy for this. The eggs would not live
when deposited in the bark if this white
wash were used. A general discussion fol
lowed this paper.
N. W. Motheral said the codlln moth
attacked nothing but Bartlett pears, and
he thought it must be guided by smell or
instinct. Very little was known about
this and it was very desirable to know
more. He said that an application of lime,
sulphur and salt in December would
destroy the littie insect which bores into
peaches at the twig, and that "sheep dip"
sprayed on csttle would kill the Texas
tick.
W. Eebert Smith of Napa read a paper
on "Additional Notes on the Treatment
jof the Root Knot." He said a solution of
bluestone would kill the knot without In
! juring the tree, but he hail not been able
Ito find the cuuse of the disease. Many
writers contend that the disease is due to
congestion of sap.
William Barry of Niles prepared a paper
on the "Colonization of tne Rhizobius in
Alameda County," which was read for
him by the secretary. It was considered a
very valuable paper" Barry states that for
many years the fruit-growers of Alameda
County have been annoyed by the "biack
scale" and "brown apricot scale," thd;<e
being the only real detriment to the fruit
growing interests of the county. The cost
of washes had always been a great expense,
yet the scale seemed to increase and
smutty trees and fruit resulted. Many
orchardists would have given up in de
spair had not fruit commanded a good
price.
When the price went down many
stopped spraying. In 1894 the Rnizobius
ventralis was available and proved to be a
Moses to the fruit-grower. The colonies
increased s-o that tnis year ne was able to
distribute several hundred from one small
grove of orange trees belonging to H.
Crowell of Irvington. They also migrated
to another grove a quarter of a mile away,
where they are as numerous. His requisi
tion for 300 boxes in .which to distribute
the beetles had been honored by the Su
pervisors. Mr. Crowell has thousands of
of the Rhizobius to spare. The Rhizobius
toowoombie have likewise increased.
Lactc of faith and impatience of results
had to be contended with in introducing
tne insects. H. E. Mosher could not flud
them the next year, but the second year
he found them in large numoers with
beneficial results.
The Rhizobius had also heen placed
with great success in the orchard of Dr.
Kirn ball of Haywards, who is an enthu
siast in the matter. The larvse were found
in Mr. Meek's orchard a mile away, al
though none ot the beetles had been placed
there. In placing the beetles in decidu
ous trees Mr. Barry recommended small
bundles of short cornstalks in tree
crotches, the stalks with the husks on,
and in lieu of them rags or sacks are the
best substitute. Branches of weeds will
help to protect them during the winter
months.
The first paper of the afternoon session
was oy Ed M. Ehrhorn of Mountain View
on '"Leaf-eating Caterpillars." He said
after the first spraying with paris green
the pest usually disappeared and could be
successfully fought by handpicking or
paris green.
Professor S. M. Woodhridge of Los An
geies talked on "Plant Foods and Science,
Chemically Illustrated." He said there
ought to be a law in this State requiring a
manufacturer to put on each bag of fer
tilizer just what amount of phosphate it
contained, and if he didn't do it put him
in jail. This was applauded.
This talk was very scientitic. It mysti
fied many fruit-groVers. Major Berry of
Visalia was one of them. He took a shot
at Wood bridge, saying he hadn't learned
anything from the scientific lalk. What
he wanted was practical information that
would be of some benefit to him.
Colonel Berry then proceeded to tell the
convention what he called a few plain
truths. He saicf the convention reminded
him of a mutual admiration society.
Members bad sat in the Senate chamber
three days talking and smiiing at each
other, and the only practical solution of
fruit-growers' troubles he had heard in
three days was by Mr. Stable, who yester
day proposed an organization of fruit
growers. He proceeded to say that it was
high time the fruit-. rowers did some
thing besides meeting year after year to
no purpose. Colonel Berry was squelched
on a point of order.
Vice- President D. G. Fowler moved that
the recommendations made in the excel
lent paper read yesterday by E. F. Adams
of Wrights on "The Feasibility of Estab
lishing a Free Market in San Francisco"
be indor-ed by the convention. He made
an energetic speech in support of the mo
tion, saying it was a natter of great im
portance. The motion carried unani
mously. The paper suegeats the getting
together of committees from the
California and San Francisco Fruit
Exchanges, the railroads and also
the State Harbor Commission on
the subject, and that the Harbor Commis
sion be given more power necessary to
bring it about.
Jonathan Begg of San Diego, who claims
to have a mechanical device Dy which
green fruit can be transported without ice,
was given a few minutes in which to ad- 'â 
dress the convention.
The fruit-growers next listened to a
paper by James E. Gordon of ban Jose on
"Prune Culture From a Commercial
Standpoint." This paper attributed the
fall in the price of prunes partly to over
production and iuferior qualities raised by
inexperienced growers on imerior land.
He said that the proper boxing and grad
ing of prunes would do more to solve the
problem of overproduction.
Just before the afternoon session ad
journed, the tall, pine-treo form of Russ
Stephens towered up in front of the con
vention, and he proceeded to stir it up as
Maior Berry had attempted to do.
Mr. Stephens, in ringing tones and long
arm gesture, said that the question of she
transportation and marketing of fruits
was one of the greatest importance to
fruitgrowers and that the convention had
given it little attention. He said it should
be given great attention.
"It is a farce," said he, "to assemble
here and listen to essays on subjects that
do not affect the interests of the fruit
growers or the State. We must find some
outiet through which we can dispose of
our fruits at a living price.
"I know I am out of order, but I am so
for the purpose of calling the attention of
the men of this convention and the chair
man to the importance of speaking out on
this subject if they dare."
The result of this and other speeches
was that to-morrow morning's programme
was heard in a special session to-night
and the questions ot transportation, mar
keting, picking, gathering and grading
fruit were made the special order for to
morrow morning. .
At the evening session a paper on "The
Evils of Food Adulteration," by Mrs. Ell
wood Cooper, was rea<l by President Ell
wood Cooper, Vice-Presiaent D. T. Fowler
being in the chair.
She denounced adulteration of food as
criminal, said it would require long effort
and education to correct it, and advised
the enactment of a National pure-food
law. The paper was prepared over a year
ago.
A resolution to the effect that it is the
desire of the convention that the next
Legislature pass a pure food law was
offered by Major Berry and referred to the
committee on legislation.
"California Fruit Industry From a Com
mercial Standpoint," by B. N. Rowley of
San Francisco, was the next paper. He
was greeted with applause. He said there
were thousands of acres planted with hun
dreds of thousands of trees in California
that could never be made to pay.
This was partly due to inferior fruit and
lack of knowledge in cultivation. Com
mercial success was baaed on quality and
not quantity. One car well packed would
bring profitable returns, while poorly
packed fruit would bring the producer
los*.
He advised encouraging more buyers
and shippers for both fresh and dried
fruit-. He said there was practically no
limit to the grower of the possibilities of
packing and drying. The markets of the
world were open.
Professor Wood worth of Berkeley read
a paper by Professor E. W. Hilgard of
Berkeley on 'Tirieation to Develop the
Size and Quality of Deciduous Fruits."
rhis was a practical and valuable paper,
and was listened to with much interest.
It concluded the evening session.
NOT KEPT OUT OF SIGHT
The Craven Deeds Have Been
Submitted to Free Inspection
by Experts
Attorneys for the Executors of the
Fair Will Denounce a Statement
to the Contrary as False.
In its report of the dismissal of the
Craven vs. FaiT ejectment suits before
Judge Slack on Wednesday morning, the
Examiner went out of its. way to make it
appear that Dalmns & Shortridge are
withholding the famous Craven deeds
from inspection of the attorneys and ex
perts employed by the other side. In its
issue of yesterday morning the Examiner
says:
The deeds have been kept out of sight since
they have been piesented for record, but Mr,
Knight is welcome to photographs. The ex
nerts, however, want the documents, and the
fight to get them must begin anew.
The truth of this statement is denied
flatly by the experts referred to and by
the attorneys for the executors, Garret
McEuerney and Pierson & Mitchell, and
therefore, of course, by Delmas & Short
ridge.
Mr. McEnerney, attorney for Mr. Good
iellow, one of the executors, speaking of
the matter yesterday afternoon, said: '"So
far from keeping the deeds irom us I have
to say that we have been affurded every
required facility to inspect them. The
experts also have seen and inspected them
and have been allowed to Dhotograph
them how and as often as they pleased.
We have been assured that we can inspect
them further as much as we may desire.
We have not asked the court for an order
of examination, and we will not do so, as
we have no notion that it will be neces
sary."
Mr. Mitchell, of Pierson & Mitchell,
counsel for the executors, said: "We have
been treated very courteously by Delmas
& Shortrid.ue in this matter, and have no
complaint to make whatever. We have
seen and inspected the deeds, and can do
so again when we desire to do so, we are
assured."
Mr. David N. Carvalho, one of the ex
perts referred to, said last evening: "The
two deeds were submitted to me on tue
afternoon of Friday, November 27, and I
was at that time given every faciity for
inspecting them with magnifying glasses
and microscope. At the same time Mr.
Daniel T. Ames was given equal oppor
tunities witu myself to make such in
spection. On the followine day, Satur
day, I was present at the taking of pnoto
eraphs of every written pace of the two
deeds at Taber's gallery. Every photo
graph was taken as I wished. Photo
uraphs were taken both with the special
apparatus and lens belonging to the estate
of James G. Fair, and with the lens or
dinarily used by the operators at Taber's
gallery in the' business. Mr. Ames was
present during a portion of the time tnat
the photographs were being taKen, and
left the gallery of his own accord.
"During the taking of the photographs
I stated that the light at that gallery was
the best that could be had for the purpose;
that it was a white light, being a north
light, and better than the direct sunlight,"
Mr. Brittain, speaking for Delmas &
Shortridge, said : "We have not withheld
the deeds from the inspection of any per
sons having a right to-fiee them, nor have
we hindered them in their inspection.
Exactly the contrary lihs been the case â
we have given them every assistance in
inspecting ana in securing photographs of
the deeds."
AIDED THE LEPERS.
Two tittle GirU Who Halted Twenty
Dollars to Buy Com Torts for the
Unfortunates.
Miss Isabella Henderson and Miss Nel
lie Kelly, two pretty girls of this City,
have just finished raisinc a fund for char
itable purposes which they determined on
collecting some time ago. Both had
beard 01 the condition of tne unfortunate
lepers at the Pesthouse and out of pity for
the sufferers set about to obtain money to
buy them clothes and other comforts.
A fair seemed the most feasible way of
collecting funds and the result shows that
they worked not in vain. They called at
the office of the Board of Supervisors yes
terday and left a shining $20 piece with
Deputy Clerk Brown to be handed to
Benjamin, who is well known
to be much interested in renderingtlie lives
of the lepers less burdensome. The coin
represented the entrance fees, which were
o cents, and the net profits of the sale of
icecream and other cfuiniifs. The fair was

AT ANGELS CAMP
Running Fight Between
Officers and Outlaw
Inman.
The D3sperado Escapes After
His Pursuers Exhaust Their
Ammunition!.
Believ d to Have Been Wounded
While in Flight to Avoid
Capture.
ANGELS CAMP, Cal., Dec. aâ Robert
Inman, jail-breaker and desperado, had
a liveiy fight this evening on Main street
with officers who were attempting his
capture. Constable Fonts had already
been notified that the man was wanted,
and was eying his prospective prisoner,
when the man broke and ran. He was
followed by a shot from the officer's pistol.
A young man named Williamson joined
in the pursuit, and luiran turned and
fired a shot alternately at each of his pur
suers. Then he continued in his flight
The officers followed and fired until their
ammunition was exhausted, when they
were obliged to give up the pursuit and
the outlaw escaped.
Several hundred people witnessed the
fight and the escape of Inman, and sev
eral had narrow escapes from flying bal
lets. A posse was organized and went in
pursuit of the fugitive. It is believed he
was wounded during the fight.
BLUFEED THE OFFICERS.
Inman Coolly Defies Two Men Who At-
trrnpt His -i treat.
PORTLAND.Ob , Dec 3.â "80b" Inman,
the outlaw who broke jail at Roteburg
about ten days ago, is still at large. He
was heard of in Southern Oregon, where
he is standing off all men sent in pursuit
of him. There is no regular posse follow
ing him, but he proves good against any
three or four men attempting his recap
ture. He has a revolver and plenty of
ammunition, and those acqaainied with
his desperate character say that he will
explode his last cartriu ge before surrender

On Tnesday Inman climbed on the
southbound freight at a woodpile near
Glendale, and taking a position on an oil
car rode as a hobo to Grants Pass, where

Dr. Sauden is a physician of the highest standing among the medical profession having
devoted thirty years of his life to the practice of medicine, and has given it up now for several
years so that he may devote his knowledge exclusively to this better, more effective means of

the trainmen put him off. Fireman Steve
Willis recognized him and telegraphed
ahead to Medford, warning the officers to
be on hand, well armed, when the train
arrived there.
In man bought a ticket to Gold Hill,
and at the latter place was again put off,
but climbed on the oilcar again as the
train pulled out of the station. At Med
ford, when the train arrived, City Marshal
Cofer and Constable Wolf, heavily armed
were on hand and covered Inman with
their revolvers. Inman paid no atten
tion to the command to throw np his
hands, but, jumping to the ground, pistol
in hand, declared that if the officers shot
he would follow suit. Tben he deliber
ately walked down the track a short dis,
tance and turned off through an orchard
striking for the hills. The officers fol
lowed for a couple of miles, when In
man finally shouted to them that he was
getting tired of their actions, and would
hurt some one if they continued to follow
him.
The Medford officers say they could not
have taken Inman without killing him,
and they did not care to do that fora
paltry $50 reward.

WANTED IN OGDEN.
A Local Detective and a Deputy Mar
shal from Utah Searching for Mrs.
Mercer and Her Child.
Some trace of Mis. Mercer of Ogden, the
wife of a wealthy stockman of Utah,
whose flight about a month ago with her
little daughter was reported in the papers,
has been found.
Detective Ross Whitaker has been as
sisting Deputy Marshal John Sullivan of
Utah in his efforts to locate the woman.
Sullivan started on her trail. He fol
lowed her to St. Paul, and thence began a
pursuit over the Northwest as tar as Se
attie and Tacoma, thence down the coast
to this City.
Mrs, Mercer and her child arrived here
on November 16 and registered at the
Palace Hotel under an assumed name,
where she remained ovor night. The
local police had been advised to be on the
lookout for her, but they were thown off
the track, as the little girl was dressed in
boy's clothing.
Deputy Marshal Sullivan reached here
too latet to intercept her in her flight
southward. He is stopping at the Grand
Hotel and is trying to get another scent on
the trail. It is believed she has gone to
Arizona. If found she will be taken back
to Ogden on a charge of abduction.
Meicer an>! his wife recently separated
and a suit for divorce was started in the
Ogden courts. Both wanted the custody
of the child, and Mrs. Mercer fled with
her.

prosecution, and their evidence was about
the same as given at the Coroner's inquest
last week.
The defense was not ready, and a con
tinuance was asked and granted till Tues
day. It is said the defense will have a
number of witnesses who will endeavor to
show that Miller was insane at the time of
the shooting.A STARNGE EXPLANATION
MAOE BY JUDGE HEBBARD
He: Appointed a Receiver Knowing That the Supreme
.â¢.-...Court Had Decided That Such Appointments
Were Illegal and Void,
fvidei3C3 in the Williams Libel
Case Showing How the Bank
: ,\ ".:.' '.: Was Looted.
FRIEND WATT WAS FAVORED.
Peculiar Admissions by the Judge
...That He Sometimes Acted Offi
cially From Impulse.
siidge Hebbard in the Williams libsl
rase yesterday made several very peculiar
admissions, among them that he was an
intirnifie personal friend of General
and James Alva Watt; that he
was a friend, of Judge Wallace, the gen
eral's father-in-law ; that he appointed
â Teneral Sheetian at a time when he was
ifn full personal and judicial knowledge of
I-. c fad that the Supreme Court had de-
V ed it to be unlawful to appoint a re-
V ver for a savings bank; that it did not
, uke any difference to him whether the
oeral occup.ea other offices of fat
lanes at the time or not, and that ne
mi.' times performed his judicial func
from impulse.
It came out in the evidence that the
was indebted to Delmas & Short
:â¢- balance of $500 under their con- I
raet for legal services, which sum the I
firm never drew.
On the whole, the prosecution made a
very' sorry showing of their end of the
case, all their efforts having only estab
li hed."tfhÂ£ ? fact in the minds of the spec
tatoEs^hat under the management of the j
Shfehaii-Watt crowd the bank was looted '
und^r-the guise of fees and expenses.
Juiijge 'Hebbard proceeded with his
btat-ement on the opening of court in the
mosniogi He considered the appointment
oLtfie receiver in the Knight and Gola
ireeVcases as "a kind of double-barreled
pfpcauM'on'' to protect the funds of the
tank; ,He appointed the same man re
cejxer in'thfee cases because he wanted to
. keepHh'e .remainder oi the funds of the
banfintact.
| A, few days before the 11th of June
tlje," fcitoeu called upon Chief Justice
BÂ£a"tu- "of . the Supreme Court and tola
:. at- "whatever he, Hebbard, might do
ia" t lie â master he would do without any
inÂ£eritionr of committing contempt of
court. .. Justices Van Vieet and Garoutte
V.e?e-also present at t; c interview, and
a iieatty tolo Judge Hebbard to do
.c thought best; that the Supreme
Cijqft, .would not think that any contempt
.;Xvas intended by nim.
'.' . .At ".(Ms point Mr. Foote introduced in
'.evJden.ee a 'letter dated January 25, 1895,
.. addressed. to Judgp Hebbard from Thomas
"*>-.W.'i-aaais Jr. in which Williams asked
. the' Judge "to use his influence with .Shee
han 'and. Watt to Lave the depositors
represented -on the board of direotors. Tne
.witness 'explained that "Williams and
â rLÂ»artnett.came to his chambers the next
W day ana repeated the request made in the
letter. .JtidKÂ® Hebbard in response of
fered to go. down town and endeavor to
pet the depositors a representation of four
of tbe Beven directors, and if not he would
get them a representation of three at least.
He also told Mr. Williams that as he
seemed to be anxious to get on the board
the witness would try to secure his ap
pointment, but that there would be some
difficulty in doing so because the gentle
men connected with the banK did not like
Williams. Tae J udge added to Williams
in that conversation:
" "Sc^me of your people believe that I have
been unfair and against their interest in
the bank. All I ask of you is to go among
tnose people and do what you can to dis
abuse <taeir minds of those ideas. He said
that he would do so. I went downtown
tot tbja Bank Commissioners, to Mr.
Watt and-tp General Sheehan and Judge
''-Sawyer, and. everybody I knew who had
any, influence with tbe stockholders, and
1 secured 1 the appointment of three men,
M.rv Williams being one.' "
The. attention of the witness was called
to a letter of December 4, addressed by
Â liim.'to Sheeb&n, requesting the general
â¢ t.ojjiajlow. the representatives of the Cali
i-.Jorhia". Sa*fe Deposit and Trust Company
.t*Q : inÃp4ct the books of the bank without
Obliging Judge Hebbard to make a formal
, <.q?rder to that effect. The letter was iden
tified by" the witness.
In response to questions by Mr. Thorn
ton the.witness sail that he made the ac
gtiafntance <>i James Alva Watt in 1879
whe*n lie. and Watt were studying law to
gether." . The Judge was then brought
= 4t>w,n-to the appointment of Watt as at
torney for Receiver Sheehan. On the Ist
of May he uad a talk with iSheehan and
the' latter asked tne witness whether be
bad anv'particnlar choice of attorney and
the witness sa:d that he had not.
"Whoever will be satisfactory to you
â¢ â will be satisfactory to me," said Hebbard.
<ienÂ«rai 'Sneehan mentioned Mr. Watt
I' iia.t afternoon and the witness said that
Mr. Watt "would do. He was bright and
sojart and the Judge thought that he was
an honest man.
â I said," continued the witness, "that I
was not sure that I would ever be able to
allow him any compensation, because ',his
banking act had never been considered,
ur.d I didn't know what the Supreme
Court of this State would say with refer
ence to the receiver appointed under that
act."
"Was it not the fact," asked Mr. Thorn
ton, "that it was witnin your knowledge
as a lawyer ami a Judge that it was un
lawful, and had been so decided by the
Supreme pourt, to appoint a receiver for
a savings bank ?"
"It was a new application of tbe law of
receiverships," was the evasive reply.
The witnets proceeded to tell about the
other appointments of receivers made by
him. In the case of the People vs. the
Pacific Bank he had appointed H. I.
Willey as receiver.
"Didn't the Supreme Coart decide that
that appoimnient was illegal?" was asked.
"Not in that case entirely," replied
Judge' Hebbard in a hesitating manner.
Mr. Thornton called attention to the de
cision of the Supreme Court that the ap
pointment of a receiver in the case of the
People against tbe State Investment and
insurance Company was illegal. Several
cases were qudied by Mr. Thornton in
.wtfich the Supreme Court had decided
=thatÂ« receiver could not be appointed in a
bank.* The witness replied that the de
cision li the Supreme Conrt was very
. f^esh in'his mind at the time he appointed
General Sheehan in the Knight and Goid
\r. r ; cases.
\j So." said Mr. Thornton, "the Supreme
W'jufttiad twice decided before you made
"t' appointment of General Sueeban in
twe Khightand Goldtree cases to the effect
that" your appointment of receivers in
such cases was totally void?"
Air. Foote saved the witness from this
question by the objection that the record
was tne be^ evidence. Mr. Thornton tried
another tack:
"Youujaueari order appointing a re
ceiver in the Goldtree case eighteen days
after the Supreme Court had decided that
the appointment of a receiver in a savings
bank was unlawful?"
The crowd of depositors in the court
room craned their necks forward to hear
what the witness had to say to that direct
question.
"Yes," replied the witness, carelessly,
"that v,as when I heard of the opinion
orally. It was ;-ixteen days after the re
nmtiiur came down thail made that ap
pointment."
"What judicial opinion induced you to
appoint a receiver after the Supreme Court
had decided that the appointment of a
receiver in a similar case was unlawful?"
was asked.
Judge Hebbard, by way of explaining
his answer, which seemed to need coa^
siderable explanation, read from the opin
ion of the Supreme Court in volume
103 of the California Reports. It
was an equity case, ne said, "and reading
between the lines'" he had concluded that
this was an equity case, such as the court,
in its opinion vt 'June 11, had referred to,
and be believed that he was warranted in
appointing a receiver in that case, in or
der that tne assets might be kept intact
until the bank got into tne hands of the
directors to put ii into liquidation.
In response to a question as to whether
or not the witness considered E. H. Knight
and Nathan Goldtree as private persons,
the witness replied that he considered
them as stockholders.
"Now, Judge Hebbard," inquired Mr.
Thornton, sharply, "do you know of any
decision by the Supreme Court since 1852
up to the present time in which a receiver
in a banking corporation could ever be
appointed?"
Mr. Foote saved his client again by a
timely objection.
Mr. Thornton argued that the witness
had said ttiat there were conflicting opin
ions â "some one way and some another."
The witness said that the language of
the decision in the one hundred and tnird
California indicated to his mind that in an
equity action by a stockholder against this
bank the appointment of a receiver would
be warranted.
"You considered the then situation of
the bank a justification for making this
appointment notwithstanding the de
cision?" asked Mr. Thornton.
"I took the decision into consideration
also," was the reply.
"Will you please explain how a receiver
in both cases can take possession of the
property and assets of the defendant at
the same time?"
"Yes; there might be three cases In
one of which a receive! might be dis
charged and he mignt continue to be the
receiver in the other cases."
Judge Hebbard was asked next as to
whether General Sneehan had made any
statement to the court of his receipts and
expenditures as receiver, and he replied
that the only thing he remembered was a
resolution by the board of directors that
they were satisfied with his report The
receiver thereupon asked to be discharged,
and when the witness saw the directors'
receipt in General Sheehan's hands he
granted the discharge.
Mr. Spelling, on behalf of certain par
ties, objected to the discharge of Sheehan,
but there were so many urounds to the ob
jection that the witness could not remem
oer them all.
The witness made an evasive answer to
tbe question as to whether he thought
that the attorney for the receiver should be
tne attorney for the bank also by saying
that if he thought so then he thought bo
now.
The facts of his intimacy with General
Sheehan and tbe extent of that intimacy
were next inquired into. Judge Hebbard
said that he became acquainted with
General Sheehan when he joined the
Union League Clult in 1889 or 1890. He
knew that General Sbeelian was a son-in
law of Judge Wallace, a friend of his, and
that he was Register of the Land Office,
and because he Delieved that the general
would make a good official he appointed
him as one of the Commissioners in the
case of Emeric agamst Alvarado. The
extent of his intimacy with the general
was to take a drink with him at the Union
League Club or play a game of pedro
with him. Sheehan got $11,000 out of the
Emeric- Alvarado case.
"Did you know as a fact that Sheehan
wan or had been for some time secretary
of tbe Yosemite Commissioners?"
"Yes."
"Did tbe fact that he was secretary at
that time influence you in your action in
appointing him as receiver, or did the
fact that he was Register of the United
States Land Office influence you at all?"
'Not at all."
"Did the fact that be was also secretary
and manager of the defendant influence
you?"
"That made no difference to me at all.
I regarded him as a proper person."
"You thought then that it was entirely
jusi and proper to appoint as receiver of
tbe corporation the secretary and mana
ger?"
"In this case, yes; but he was not secre
tary and manager then. I sometimes act
upon impulse, and I could not say what I
would have done, because the facts wer~
not as you have stated," replied Judge
Hebbard.
The witness told of a visit to the Bush
street Theater shortly before election day,
on which occasion the depositors were in
session. He occupied a box for several
minutes, but was practically driven out
because lie could not with decency re
main any longer. At that meeting they
accused nim ot every crime from misde
meanor to le ony. Mr. Pike, for instance,
had called him a liar, a thief and a mur
derer.
"Whom did you ever kill?" inquired
Mr. Thornton with an air of interest.
The witness did not remember of ever
having killed anybody. He added:
"When I came in Pike changed his iune
and said, 'Judge Hebbard, you and I were
enemies, but you have not been treated as
an American citizen here, and now I am
your friend.' "
In reply to further questions Judge Heb
bard s^id that he was Presiding Judge at
the time these bank proceedings wore be
gun and be had assigned the cases to him
self. He admitted that he was tbe mov
ing spirit in the matter of obtaining an
indictment against tne defendant Wil
liams lor libel, but he did not appear be
fore the Grand Jury except in tbe Mar
riott case.- Mr. Kahn had drawn up the
papers and he had not received any re
tainer for it.
"So say we all of us," said Mr. Foote
witn a sigh, whereupon even the afflicted
depositors laughed.
Lawyer ilutton was the next witness.
He told about the meeting in Judge Heb-
Dard's chambers and the Judge's promise
that he would allow the directors tore
sign, provided that everything would be
satisfactory to everybody. On the next
day in court Mr. Delmas reminded Judge
Hebbard of his promise and the Judge
said that he repudiated the whole transac
tion, or the whole affair. Delmas <fc Short
ridge submitted four names and Mr. ili.h
ton submitted a lone iiÂ»> of 250 names,
from which the Judjre might select tbe
seven new directors. But whenever they
went to do anything there was always
somebody bobb'ng up with some proposi
tion or another in opposition. Watt was
among the directors.
Henry E. Highton told about Mr. Del
mas' appearance in court on June 11 and
his statement of Judge Hebbard's promise
and the Judge's denial of Â«he same. Dr.
Bousbev had filed an affidavit and Mr.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1896.
Delmas filed an affidavit and motion to
permit the directors to resign, provided
that all parties would agree as to the per
sonnel of the new board. Judge Hebbard
said frequently from the bench on both
occasions mat he would modify the in
junction if the stockholders and the de
positors agreed upon the new board.
There was no possibility of their ever
aereeing. The witness could not swear
that Judee Hebbard used the word "repu
diated" when Mr. Delmas spoke of his
promise. Judge Hebbard did not then
state what promise he did make.
General Sheehan was recalled and said
that when he took possession of the bank
he found $9 35 cash and a special deposit
of $1501 90 in a tiu box. out of which had
been taken $247 50, represented by a paper
tag left by Director Graves. There was
also a check showing the payment of
$2500 to Delmas & Shortridge for legal
services, dated May 1, 1894.
This check was admitted in evidence.
Mr. Thornton offered and placed in
evidence the contract between the bank
and Deimas & Shortridge, in which it was
agreed that tne firm should receive $6000
per annum, of which sum they were to
receive $3000 upon the execution of the
contract, which was dated April 18, 1894.
"Was it not the fact that Delmas &
Shortridge did not receive what they were
entitled to imder the contract? Was any
sum of money other than this $2500 re
ceived by Delmas & Shortridge between
the date of the execution of the contract,
April 18, 1894, and May 1 of the same
year?" asked Mr. Thornton.
"No, sir."
'â¢Do you mean to convey tne impression
that there was anything irregular in the
presentation and payment of this check?"
"Not at all," replied Attorney Kahn
before the witness could say anything.
"We never claimed that there was any
thing wrong about it."
"Then why did you biing it into this
case" demanded Mr. Thornton.
"Because it has been charged that the
money of the bank has been squandered
in attorney fees?' replied Mr. Kahn.
"There were others," said General Shee
han. "There was L. E. Phillips, who re
ceived $20;) per month."
"There is no contention here," repeated
Mr. Kahn, "that this contract is unjust or
irregular."
Mr. Henley argued that the Sheehan-
Watt crowd had prevented Deimas &
Shortridge from carrying out their con
tract and had hired other attorneys alter
having paid Delmas & Shortridge a cer
tain sum of money under the contract,
which was a wasteful use of the money.
General Sheehan told about Samuel M.
Shortridge going to the bank on May 22
and demanding possession of the prem
ises, claiming that be was the le al attor
ney of the bant. The witness refused to
acknowledge Mr. Shortridge in that
capacity.
Attorney Bartnett told about Judge
Hebbard requesting the defendant, Wil
liams, to disabuse the minds of the de
positors of the impression that he, the
Judge, was biased and unfair in his treat
ment of the depositors. The Ju ige ac
cused Williams of having made defama
tory statements concerning Dim, and
Williams denied having done so. Then
the Judge promised to do what be could
to have Williams appointed on the new
board of directors.
An adjournment was had until 10
o'clock this morning.
MIDWEEK THEATER NOTES
â¢â¢ Dr. Belgraff" Arouses Mild interest.
Some Clever Comedy "Work at
the Grand.
"Dr. Belgraff" is drawing fairly, though
Lackaye's second hypnotic yen ture has not
caught the public taste as his Svengalidid.
Next Monday Lackaye proposes to give
San Francisco theater-goers the first op
portunity of seeing the new play, "Captain
Bob," and George Alexander's English
success, the one-act drama, "Moliere."
"The New South" is drawing satisfac
torily at the Columbia Theater. Tde play
has been made more concise since it was
seen here some time ago and it ia care
iully acted by the members of the Gris
mer-Davies Company. C Jay Williams
as "the pig-headed old rebel," as be
euphonious y styles himself, is doing ex
cellent work and his speech "bewrayeth
him" as bailing indeed from soutu of
Dixie. The others use the soft Soutnern
speech more or less successfully, all ex
cept Ethel Barrington, who should aban
don her efforts to talk like a wild un
tamed Topay. In her desire to be a child
of the South she talks a jargon wnich
would be disowned by North and Souih
alike. It is by contrast with the charming
diction of the general that the inequali
ties of Miss Barrington's speech stand
out.
The next play at the Columbia will be
"The Cotton King," which is said to con
tain some realistic and sensational epi
sodes.
The comedy work in "The Midnight
Alarm" at the Grand is keeping
the audiences in a constant state
of mirth. Lottie Williams as Spar
kle, a waif (with songs), gives people
their moneys worth in laughter alone,
and Leslie Morosco as a bunko steerer is
thoroughly clever and amusing. The sen
sational features of the third and fourth
acts are well put on the stage and taken
altogether "The Midnight Alarm" is one
of the best things seen at the Grand for
some time.
"The End of the Century iB in the last
days of a prosperous run at the Alcazar.
Next week "Alabama" will be played,
with George Osbourne specially engaged
for the production.
The melodious "Little Duke" is receiv
ing an exceilent performance from the
Tivoli company this week. Miss Lilly
Post has been ill for two days, and her
role has been sung by Miss Schnabel, but
she is expected to return to the cast to
night. Next week Offenbach's fantasie,
"The Brigands," will be produced.
The Orpheum's novelties are drawing
well this week, Stewart, the male Patti,
being perhaps the favorite of them all. It
takes reflection to realize the danger and
difficulty of Ellen Vetter's exhibition,
which consists of ascending and descend
ing a spiral way, she being encased in a
globe. People who realize, when the cur
tain goes up, that there is a woman iiwde
the bail catcu their breath when it rolls
dangerously near the edge and almost
topples over as it nears the summit of the
spiral erection.
At the Baldwin Theater on Monday
nieht, the 14th inst., Ellen Beach Yaw,
the phenomenally high soprano, will
make her San Francisco debui.
This evening the patriotic and military
opera, "Heroes of '76," will ba played at
the California Theater.

oughfare Organize an Im
provement Club.
A meeting of the property-owners and
business men of Valencia street was held
at Mission Defense Hall, Twentieth and
Guerrero streets, last evening, who organ
ized the Valencia-street Improvement
Club.
The prime object of the new organiza
tion ia to improve the lighting of that
thoroughfare and the members put them
selves into the work at once.
F. Q. Norman, hardware merchant, 842
Valencia street, was elected president; H.
C. Flageollet, butcher, 906 Valencia street,
secretary; Charles Zissip, dry-goods mer
chant, 925 Valencia street, treasurer.
A number of addresses were made and
tba sense of the meeting was that the
wholn street be canvassed with a view of
getting the assistance of every one doing
business thereon in the matter of changing
the lights from gas to electric.
For this the following members were
selected by the president as an executive
committee: Dr. John A. Miller, 1018 Va
lencia street; W. V. Cords, Sixteenth and
Valencia; John H. Dawson, Twenty-third
and Valencia; R. J. Dowdall, N neteenth
and Valencia; W. J. Kenny, 519 Valencia;
A. Shoemaker, Twenty-first and Valencia.
On motion of Mr. Van Duzer, the dues
of the club were fixed at 25 cents a month.
The time of meeting will be Thursday
evening. _
KILLED BY A NAIL.
Contractor Leonard B. Schmid Suc
cumbs to Blood-Poisoning at the
German Hospital.
Leonard B. Schmid, a young and well
known builaer and contractor, died
Wednesday at the German Hospital,
having been brought to an untimely end
through a stranee mischance, which at first
seemed of trifling consequence.
About ten days ago while supervising
the construction of some new houses Mr.
Schmid happened to tread on a rusty nail
which pierced his shoe and penetrated to
the flesh. The best of care under the
direction of Drs. Baum and Rohling was
given the patient at the German Hospital,
but all was in van, blood-poisoning super
vened and gcumid died, as stated, in great
agony.
He leaves a widow and two children,
residing at 3241 Sixteenth street, beside a
host of friends. He belonged to a large
number of beneficiary societies.
The funeral will probably tafce place on
Sunday.
M'FARLAND AND STEVENS.

Floyd A. McFarland of San Jose and
Orlando L. Stevens of Ottumwa, lowa, two
of the fastest bicycle racers :n the country,
arrived yesterday morning over the soutu
ern route, after a long season on the Na
tional racing circuit. Stevens has been
following the circuit for several years, but
this year was McFarland : s first experi
ence. Both men are splendid riders and
are in the pink of condition. They came
here to contest in the Velodrome races
during the winter and will appear for the
first time at the big meet to-morrow.
E. B. Jerome has positively withdrawn
from the contest lor the presidency of tnÂ«
Associated Cycling Clubs and the fight

Club and A. W. Wehe of the San Fran
cisco Road Club. The annual meeting

For Thin People
Who lack strength and vigor
there is nothing better than a
pure rtialt stimulant to build up
the system and clothe the body
with sound, healthy -flesh. Noth-
ing so quickly gives new life to
the debilitated. This fact has
been proved by thousands of men
and women who have gained
health and strength by using
Duffy's Pure
Malt Whiskey.
The greatest and best of medi-
cinal stimulants. The vitalizing
principle contained in the pure
malt feeds and nourishes every
part of the body, tones up the
stomach and sharpens the appe-
tite. It soothes excited nerves,
arouses the circulation and re-
stores lost energy. As a stimu-
lant and tonic it has never been
equaled. No wide-awake drug-
gist or grocer thinks of being
out of Duffy's pure malt.

THE COAL TRADE.
The private circular of 1. steuart Rives the re
ceipts at this port during the first eleven months
of 1896 Â»t 1,169,800 tons, against l,300,8Â«0 tons
during the seme time in 1895, ana says: "Freight
raiesl'orthe shipment of coal to this port from
Australia being now considerably higher than
have lately been ruling, mus' of necessity cause
an advance in prices of these coals In the market,
while the higher cost of transporiation from there
prevails, which may be for some lutle time. The
cost of importing Kngiish anthracite coal has been
materially increased from the same cause."
S Explanation.
â¢ The arrow flies with the wind. . The top figures
at station Indicate maximum temperature for the
days; those underneath It, if any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in Inches and hundredths,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect poln s of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hieh" means high barometric pressure and
Is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually , preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
â¢"Lows" ally first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high in the Interior
and low along the coast, and the Isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" Is Inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is Improb
able. With a "hl?h" In the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather In winter. The reverse of these condition!
will produce an opposite result.

after the opening the market took on a firmer
tone.' During the after:. oon the tendency was
upward, but operations were not disposed to branch
out to any extent pending the publication of the
President message. The grangers were strength
ened by the declaration of the regular dividends
by the Chicago and Northwestern directors â  an 1
semi-official statements to the effect that the road

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111., Dec. 4.â The wheat market to
day was rather quiet.. On the .information that
Liverpool had declined i/ 2 d, price* here lost s/ 8 to
â  r 's l f a cent right at the beginning of the session.
There seemei to be a fair demand for wheat at
these prices, and as ' foreign buyers' orders ap
peared both in this and the New York markets, it
was not long before the recovery of a full cent
from the lnslae quotations wai made. After rest
ing around the . top, 88c, for May. the offerings be
gan to increase and the demand slacken, s Prices
fell away under the pressure, most of the earlier
advance disappearing. Receipts at Chicago were
24 cars and 131.267 bushels were taken from
st .re. . The Northwest had 355 cars, against 1070
a year ago. . ..
The Cinclnnattl Price Current reported the grow
ing crop, in good condition. After declining to
Ms.sc for May shortly before noon, the market de
veloped firmness and advanced to the early high
price. Unfavorable Argentine crop news was an
in portant bull Influence in to-day's market. Ex
pert clearances . were 272,734 â  bushels. Closing
Paris-cables were unchanged to higher. Berlin
and Antwero were , ; lower. The sale of .' 85,000
barrels of flour a; Han Francisco for shipment to
Australia helped prices at the close. . May wheat
opened from 81% cto S'iy a c, sold between 816/gc
and S3"/BC, closing at b3%@Â»3%c, 13/ @ii^c
higher than yesterday. Estimated receipts for to
morrow 24 cars, ao. 2 red spot wheat ranged
from 90% cto 92% c. closing about 92Â»i@92%c
-: CORNâ The tone of the market reflected that of e
wheat but with alight trade and no interest in th
grain. The range of prices was necessarily nar
row. The Cincinnati - Prcs Current reported the
lower temperamres which have been prevailing as
favoring a better condition of corn. Receipts were
quiet and unchanged. . Receipts were 1 78 cars and
7567 bushels were taken from store. Liverpool
cables were quiet and unchanged. Export clear
an. es were 89,662 bushels. Ma/ opened at 2bVic,

fluence, prices advancing or receding in response
to similar movements In. that market. Receipts
were 168 cars. There were no wl hdrawals from
sto-e. Exports were â . but 900 bushels. May oats

SEEKS A DIVORCE
Sequel to an Episode That
. .Once Excited North
Oakland.
.... â¢
But for Another Woman the
Young Wife Says She Might
. Yet Be Happy.
Smt Months Ago H r Htr.band Left
. Her With 80 Cent?, Osten
sibly Icr Europe.
â¢ -Oakland Office Ban Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Dec. 3. j
Mrs. Daniels of Thirty-third street has
applied for a divorcj from her husband,
and in the allegations of ncr complaint
the name of a well-known Oakland lady
is prominently mentioned.
' Several months ago the Daniels rented
a furnished bouse and lived in good style
. in 'North Oakland. Nothing much was
, known about them till one day Mrs. Dan
iels (ailed on a neighbor and told her a
...pk^.'ul stqry. She said that her husband
n<: left her to go on a business trip to
â¢JMverpooi a-nd was to have communicated
vX": '. her at varions points along the route.
She had made some inquiry and found
that : he had not taken passa.e on board
.'â¢the sjeamer from New York, as he had
: said" he intended to do. She further found
.. that no trace of him could be had as hay
. ing" graveled on the overland train on
-'which he said he had taken & berth.
..â  â¢' U.nJder these circumstances Mrs. Daniels
connded in her neighbors and told them
. â  rh*t"she had no doubt that she had been
deserted,, as her husband, when he left,
had given her just SO cents and promised
_ 10. send a remittance as aoon as possible.
â¢ 'She said he was a mining man, though
she did not know any of his associates in
business. "After a few weeks passed away
r/nt-'and other bills became due and Mrs.
. iianiels left the house almost as suddenly
. .as- her husband naddone.
â¢ Search was made for them by the credi
â¢.tprs. find some time later they were dis
â¢. covered in Los Angeles, the husband hay
. ing apparently succeeded in allaying his
â¢wife's susp cions regarding any inten
-.tiohaldeaertion. Later still information
â¢ was received that Mr. and Mrs. Daniels
were living in Los Angeles. These state
ments were discredited by the lady's in
timate frien.is, because her suspicion of
â¢â¢ being deserted had so acted upon her
â¢\ mind while living in this City that it was

tor if County Central Committee Issues
w â¢ ' a Call for a Rally. .
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. 3â Chairman
J. Manson of the Populist County Cen
tral Committee issued the following ad
dress today:
To 'the members of the People's party of Ala-
XQ^da, greeting:
, .The election Is over and the result you all
iiiow. Four years ago the People's party or
ganized for Hie purpose. of giving battle to
â  syndicates and trusts, especially to the most
vicious or>aH the trusts, the money monopoly.
â¢We polled in 1992, with General Weaver as
our standard-bearer, 1,200,000 votes. This
year the opponents of this monopoly count I
â  their numbers close oh 6,000,000 â a very satis- j
factory showing indeed.
We, in .fighting for principle, never call the
campaign ended as long as there remains a
wrong to be righted. The Issue has now been
square ly defined. We have observed how in
the campaign just ended the upholders of mo
rifepoly voted the ticket of the Republican
partyâ the party of special privileges â
less of former party affiliation. This must
show to the careful 'observer that henceforth
the question will be: Which shall rule, gold or
mttnnood, monopoly or the people?
Our gallant leader, W. J. Bryan, has sounded
the bugle for & grand rally and concentration
of the reform forces. He has refused a most
magnificent offer, so as not to be hindered in the
great work he has undertaken for humanity.
. â¢ Let us do likewise ana never hesitate for a
moment in our onward march for liberty. The
enemy is all-powerful and it behooves us to be
eternally .vigilant. Your committee now. de
sires to have every member of the party in this
county present at a mass-meeting to be held
at Becker's Hail, 918 Washington, street, on
Friday evening, December 4, at 8 p. m., to lay
before you a plan for the prosecution of this
campaign of education in order that two years
hence our cause may triumph at the polls.
You will see that we use the referendum, as
instructed by the late county convention, and
earnestly hope that you will avail yourself of
your right to be heard as a member, of the
party in its councils. " \ â â _â . â 
Remember that the cause you are engaged
in is just and grand. Let no momentary
weariness keep you back nor temporary defeat
dishearten you. Remember that a victory
'easily won Is never appreciated. After Vat

Therefore assist with your presence to help
perfect a p. an for the furtherance ot our cause.

Pictures of Himself and Last Wife ;

908 Broadway, Dec. 3. \
Just as to-day was closing Frederick j
Herdel fired a bullet through his head and !
fell lifeless on the steps at the entrance to
the Hall of Records. ,
For fully half an hour Herdel paced to
and fro before the building. He attracted
FREDERICK HERDEL, Who Shot Himself at the Entrance to the
Hall of Records, and His "Wife, Whom He Says in His
Farewell Letter v Is the One Who Gave Me This Death Stab."
bat little attention, aa those who noticed
him concluded that he was waiting for
some one inside.
George L. Nusbaumer, the County Sur
veyor, passed close to the stranger just as
the fatal shot was tired. On turning
round he saw the man falling on the
steps and rushed to his assistance. But
there was no need of help, for the bullet
passed clear through the man's head and
struck the pay ment.
According to letters found in Herdel's
pockets he has had three wives. He evi
dently intended to end his life, for he
wrote a letter in German to tbe Coroner.
A few years ago Herdel appeared in Mis
sion San Jose and purchased the Mil
waukee Hotel and brewery. When he
commenced business there it was tnought
he was a single man, but a few months
after his arrival his wife joined him. It
was noticed that they were not happy to
gether and things did not improve wben a
child was born a year later. About three
years ago Mrs. Herdel suddenly disap
peared.
On account of the prevailing unpleas
antness it was thought tnat Herdel might
know something of her whereabouts, and
when, after a long search, her .body was
recovered from a reservoir on the outskir s
of the town her husband was received
with grave suspicion. Nothing conclu
sive could be learned, and some time
later he married a woman named Rachel
M. Stone.
At the big fire in Mission San Jose two
years ago tne hotel burned down, but tbe
"brewery was saved. Herdel retained his
ownership of it, but it has not been run
ning, and brought in no income.
According to a rambling statement
written in German, Herdel was soed for a
divorce by his last wife, and in her com
plaint he says she hinted that he had
helped to bring about the death of his two
former wives.
The suicide left the following letter to
the Coroner:
Oakland, Dec. 3, 1896.
To the Coroner, Oakland, Alameda County, Cal.
âDear Friend: I write the following for your
information. My name is Frederick Herdel.
Have lost everything in Mission San Joseâ the
most of it through fireâ Dusiness, real estate,
wife and good name, so I will also give my
life to Alameda County.
While I am now in my full senses I will send
a bullet through my head.
I was born in 1842. I served the American
Government from 1864 to the end of the war.
Came 1 to California and had good luck until I
arrived at Mission San Jose.
Dear Coroner, when you nave finished the
Inquest and autopsy send my body to Theo
dor Dierks, on Mission street, San Francisco,

attend to the rest.
I belong to the following German lodges:

The following open letter was also on the
deceased:

My Dear Friends: When I am found and
have anything oi value on me, such as money
or pocket book, be good enough to send it to

Gold jewelry, such as watch and chain and

money with me to get home on, expecting to
obtain employment. Frederick Hkrdel.

The suicide was a man of soldierly bearing
and was well dressed. About $4 was in
his purse, and In the same rubber that
held the fur.- well letters to his friends and
the Coroner was a tintype photograph of
nimself and his wife, taken at a gallery at

City to end his life.
ACCIDENTALLY SHOT.
John Devlin, a LauDdryman, While
Handling a Revolver, Is Fatally
Wounded.
John Devlin, a laundryman, who lives
at 1414 Washington street, met with a
probably fatal accident Wednesday even
ing in the Osborne House, 806 Kearny
street.
Devlin had been drinking heavily and
that afternoon encaged a room in the
Osborne House. A few hours later peo
ple in tbe bouse were startled by five pis
tol shots that proceeded from the direc
tion of Devlin's room.
The door of his room was opened and
he was found lying on tne floor covered
with blood. He said be had been fooling
with hie revolver when It accidentally ex
ploded and tbe bullet entered his left
breast. Being afraid he would bleed to
death before assistance arrived, to attract
attention he fired four shots at the ceiing.
The patrol wacon was summoned and
Devlin watt taken to the Receiving Hospi
tal. Dr. Weil found that the bullet had
entered the left breast, between the fifth
and sixth ribs, grazed the apex of the
heart and lodged in the spinal column,
paralyzing the lower limbs. Dr. Weil ex
pressed the opinion that Devlin could not
live. He was alive last night, but in a
low condition.

LOOKING FOR
A SECRETARY
University Regents Are in
Search of a Successor
to Dr. Bonte.
He Must B2 an Agriculturist
and a Practical Busi
ness Man.
Considerable Dissatisfaction With Dr.
Bonte Tcward the Close of
His Career.
BERKELEY, Cal., Dec 3.â The pro"
fessors at the State University are much
concerned at the present time as to who
will be chosen secretary of the Board of
Regents to succeed Dr. J. H. C. Bonte,
who died last week.
The office is a most important one nnd
involves an endless amount of responsi
bility. According to the statute, which
creates the position, the holder must bo a
man conversant with the law, an agricul
turist and a man of business nuility. It
goes withont saying also that it must be a
man well known in the community and
popular among the Regents and members
of the faculty. He keeps the records of
the Regents, is their confidential adviser,
their land agent, their paymaster, the
guardian of the university reservation
and, in fact, performs the same duties in
relation to the material interests of the
university as the president does with re
gard to its executive functions.
It is particularly necessary that he
should stand well with the faculty be
cause of the close relationship wiiich ex
ists between the office of a professor and
the office of secretary as regards the aud
iting of accounts, tbe signing and passage
of requisitions and the payment of sal
aries. To find a man who is eminently
possessed of all these nullifications seems
to be somewhat of a difficult matter.
There seems to be no doubt that the
Regents will go about the choice of a new
"keeper of the privy seal" in a very cau
tious and deliberate manner because of
tbe dissatisfaction which arose among
some of the faculty toward Dr. Bonte near
the close of his career. The complaint
was entered tnat he grew to be overbear
ing and unreasonable to a marked degree,
and that he took advantage of his position
to work out his personal ends.
8o strong was the feeling crowing
against Dr. Bonte that there was serious
talk among the Regents of soon retiring
him on half pay. Thougti he had his
strong and staid champions on the board
be bad his enemies. That he guarded the
interests of the univer.-ity with zealous
care and was scrutinizing even to a fault
was recognized by the Regents, bnt
it is said that he bad outlived the period
of his usefulness and was growing to re
gard those aoout him with too little con
sideration. For the last two years of his
lite he was gradually losing his authority,
and it was only about two weeks be:ore
his death that the supervision of the work
on the grounds was taken from him and
placed in the hands of Captain Emil
Kellner. This seemed to chafe the secre
tary and immediately he sent forth the
proclamation that he would no longer be
responsible for the $5 monthly contingent
funds previously allowed the head pro
lessors for incidental expenses of their de
partments. He ordered that requisitions
shoul^Â«t>e made out for everything that
was used by the professors.
This seemingly unnecessary change
worked a great hardship to some of the
faculty and they were free to express their
views. Instead of being allowed to pur
chase 5 cents worth of ice for their labora
tory, a piece of rope, half a doz 3n pencils
or similar small articles and to charge up
the bill at the end of the month they
were required to make out a requisition
for each article and have it go through
the same course of "red-tape" as if it
were an order for $500 worth of books.
Among those who have been promi
nently mentioned for the place are Pro
fessor E. J. Wtckson of the department of
agriculture at the university ;* Dr. W. C.
Bartlett, formerly an editorial writer on
tbe San Francisco Bulletin ; and William
A. McKeown, the present assistant secre
tary. The choice will probably be made
at the monthly meeting of the board next
Tuesday. That there will be a hot right
for the place among the candidates, there
seems to be no doubt, because of the iact
that there is much honor in tbe position,
comparatively little work, and the neat
salary of $3300 per year.
That Blue and Gold.
BERKELEY, Cal., Dec. 3â Tne prob
lem as to whether the junior class at the I
State University would publish a Blue :
p.nd Gold next year, or rather whether j
Leslie C. Mott was to retain the manager- â 
ship of the publication, was to have been
decided to-day, but owing to tbe request
of some of tbe members of the clasj the
matter was postponed until next Monday.
A week or so ago Manager Mott forwarded
printed circulars to each member of the j
class asking whether they would support |
the publication, and to make known their
intention to back it up by sending a re
tarn slip, or on the other hand their pur
pose to let it go by the board by remain
ing silent. Up to to-day only 100 re
sponses from a class of 300 have been re
ceived.
Mannger Mott was to have thrown up i
the job to-night unless he got at least 150 !
favorable responses, but be was prevailed
upon to hold over until Monday. Each
member was asked to subscribe $3 50
toward defraying the expense of publica
tion.
"Unless the maiority of the class will
pay their assessment and thus make it |
known that they want the book." said
Mott to-night, "1 don't see any use in pub
lishing it. The minority of the class does
not care to assume the responsibility of
bringing out the annual for the majority
to read and criticize. I don't want to see
the class of '98 in any surh fix as the pres
ent senior class has found itself with re
gard to the Blue and Gold/
"They owe somewhere ffttbe neighbor
hood of $1000, and all because the majority
of the cmss have not come up with their
assessment. At the lowest rigure it will
cost us $2400 to issue thÂ«? boolc, anil I do
not propose to ussume the responsibility
of bringing it out unless I am supported by
the majority of the class. With returns
from 150 or a guarantee of $500 I am willing
to go ahead. Otherwise, I shall resign."

was whether United States Senators
should be elected by popular vote.
Thef>nibryo lawyers spoke with much
fluency, and presented the affirmative of
ihe question, while the Berkeley men took
the opposition. The discussion was
spirited and interesting from start to
finish.
The judges who presided were Hon. J.
M. eeaweil of Sen Francisco, Colonel V.
R. Green!*:if, U. S. A., of Berkeley, and
Professor W. V. Bosley of the law college.
Trouble of Firemen.
BERKELEY, Cal., Dec. 3.â The Beacon
Fire Company of West Berkeley held an
indignation meeting iast night, as a re
sult of their recent trouble with the Town
Trustees, and for a while it looked very
much as thougu the club would disband.
The trouble arose, as told in Tuesday's
Call, over the refusal of the Town Board
to honor a oil! of $4 for supplies which
had been countersigned by Foreman Bork
heim. Tbe board reiused to honor the bill
at its last meeting, and the next morning
Borkheini resigned.
After considering the question of dis
banding last night tlie company drew up
a list of equi <age needed by them and
decided to request the Trustees to pur
chase the same. Members of the com
pany stated this morning that if the board
refused to honor the proposed bill for sup
plies they would disband and take with
them their apparatus, wnich ia \alued at
about $300.
First Assistant Frank Teagur was elected
to succeed rx-Foreman Bosk eim and
Ben Hamilton was chosen to fill the va
cant secretaryship.
DROWNED WHILE PLAYING
Daniel Donovan, a Boy of 8 Tears,
Loses His Life in a Fool of
Bain Water.
Two little boy?, Daniel Donovan, aged 8,
and Archie Hood, about the same age,
stole away from their homes Wednesday
evening to sail on a raft in a pool of water
at Seventeenth and Temple streets. They
sailed about on the water for a few min
utes, when the raft upset and Daniel was
drowned.
But for the heroism of a playmate little
older than the venturesome lads both
would in all probability have met alike
fate. However, Thomas Norton, a boy of
12 years, saw the accident from the bank
and bravely plunged in to rescue his play
males.
The first lad he caught was Archie,
whom tie saved after a brave struggle.
But he was tired and unable to render as
sistance to the other boy, who had then
gone to the bottom.
It was almost an hour later when
Daniel was brought to the surface with a
drag, but .then life was extinct. He lived
at 46 Merrltt street, and his parents were
notified, but the little fellow was taken
to the Morgue for an official investigation.
The pool in which the boy lost his life
Was condemned by the Board of Health
as a nuisance. It was twelve feet deep and
was caused by the late rains, but had no
fence round it to keep children r.way.

A "Tout" Arreited.

A FAVORITE IN
VERY HARD LUCK
Johnny McHale Nosed Out
by Wawona, a 100
to i Shot
Geyser Again Showed Himseli
to Be a Colt Above the
Average.
Moylan Was in Fine FettleâSum
mertime Made a New Track
Record.
Although the result of the big boxing
match was the all-aDsorbing topic of con
versation at the track yesterday the sport
ing fraternity found a few iale moments
to make a hurried research through the
"dope" book and incidentally to recoup
their losses by picking a winner or two.
Nothing of a startling nature character
ized the sport until the last race came
around. Among the starters in that
event was Lew White's Sir Modred horse,
.Wawona, and so cheaply was he held in
the ring's estimation that a few of the
layers of odds offered 100 to 1 against him.
Astride his back was the colored lad,
H. Brown, and after laying away in a
good position with his mount during the
early part of the running the pickaninny
made his move in the stretch, and in a
furious drive nosed the favorite, Johnny
Mcflale, out on the last jump. Quite a
number of fortunate ones cashed tickets
on the outsider at varying odds.
The track was very fait ana everything
went smoothly with the favorites for three
races and the lines back of the stands were
lengthy. On the two succeeding runs the
pencilers got back some of their coin.
Summertime, the fast daughter of Fitz
james, set a new track record for six and
a half furlongs in the opening event, step
ping the distance in I :2lJ^. She went to
the post a 4to 5 choice and won with
something in reserve from Reddington,
which horse showed lack of gameness in
the stretch.
Geyser again proved himself to be a colt
of quality by taking the seven-furlone run
for two-year-olds after waiting on tbe
others until well on toward the wire. The
Corriean youngster was a consistent 6 to 5
favorite, with Candelaria hacked down
from twos to 3 to 2 in strong demand.
Zamar II made the pace until squared
away for home, where tie quit and was
passed by Candelaria and The Roman.
The last sixteenth Geyser came strong
and led Candelaria out by i.alf a length.
The Roman was beaten but a nose for
place honors.
The Corrigan colors were again promi
nent in the race following, a dx-fur!ong
â pin, selling. Moylan was backed to 4 to
5, and after being cut off by La Mascota
Boon after the start, and looking hope
lessly out of it, Murphy rode a persever
ing race on the gelding, and in a drive
finally got the verdict by the scantest of
heads, with La Mascota second, three
parts of a length before Alvarado.
Louis Ezeil landed the mile and a six
teenth run, with Babe Murphy. The
mare went to the post one of the second
choices, and coming from fifth position in
the stretch, won cleverly, a neck in front of
Hermanita. Tom Elmore was a good
third. Castanette, an outsider, led the
field to the bend for the wire.
Honest-going little Johnny McHale
closed a sh ht favorite over Ruinart in the
betting on the last race, and after making
ail the running, was downed a nose by the
rank outsider, Wawona. The start was
not a good one, and better away Ruinart
would probably have won, although fail
ing to finish within the money.
Notes.
Tom Griffin's mare Clissie B does not
seem to be displaying her Eastern form.
She ran disappointingly yesterday.
Zamar II showed all of his old-time
speed but found the distance too long for
him.
Lucky Dog ran a remarkably good race
and will bear watching in future races, es
pecially in muddy going.
Yesterday was cut-in day at the track,
and sixteen bookmakers hung out their
slates.
The stewards have decided to readjust
the entries of Duke Stevens and Miss
Gentry in future.
Cole Ullman watched the last race with
a most disinterested look, and after the
number of Wawona had been hoisted,
quietly drew from his pocket a ticket on

The second joint conference committee
appointed by me various State, county
and municipal boards and councils was
held yesteiday afternoon in the rooms of
the Manufacturers' and Producers' Asso
ciation, Mills building. President Sonn
tag of the association occupied the chair.
On motion of I. Jacobs, seconded by J,
A. Fiicher, the conference was made a

HEALTH INSPECTORS
HOLD THE FORT
i rThey Resist Attempts to
? - '.?â¢.: Reopen St. Francis
;:â¢;;/ 'â¢ School.
:-iiatt I Sullivan, Attorney for
â ';â¢â¢ Father BrennaD, Threatens
a Legal Battle.
â¢ The Ciosed Public Schools Will Re
open To-Day Under an Order
â¢ of Court.
The ten inspectors resumed their watch
in the yard of St. Francis School at 7
o'clock j'esterday morning to restrain any
effort on the part of Father Brennan to
bring his pupils into the condemned
schoolbouse.
The clergyman and Matt I. Sullivan, his
attorney, were on the scene at an early
hour, and for a while it looked as though
they would enter into open hostilities with
the deputies.
An attempt was made by Father Bren
nan, about half an hour before the usual
time for school to open, to force about
thirty of hie pupils into the guarded build
ing, but they were met with the same re
sistance as the deputies offered the day be
fore.
"" To the command of their pastor to
' â¢ "Come on, boys," the children endeavored
la push their way past the deputies, but
" the latter commanded them to "Stand
back." and they obeyed.
lather Brennan retreated in silence,
while his attorney took the names of the
deputies and then the excitement sub
sided for the day.
When the deputies released their watch
o*n Wednesday evening Father Brennan
â¢ strain tore down the diphtheria notices
. -that had been so conspicuous on the build
ing-, and they have not since been re
placed. School is still being held in the
old Mission Church.
Mr. Sullivan, the attorney for Father
Brernan, said last evening that the action
of the deputies was without any authority
in law, but they had received and were
acting under the direction of their supe
riors.
They had no right to post the notice or
to interfere with the children. "If they
are Dot poor," then saia he, "we wil! mak
them poor, for, if Father Brennaa sance
tions, I will bring suit agairst the depu
ties for damages on account of tueir uu
oalled-for actions to the pastor and bis
pupils."
"There is absolutely no warrant in law
for excluding the children from either the
new or old school building or the church.
"Every child that was excluded from
entering one of those places by possible
action of the inspectors has cause of ac
tion for damages against the Board of
Health, including the Mayor, health
officer and inspectors.
"I consider the case of the St. Francis
School a much more agerevated one than
that of the public schools. I propose to
make it interesting for those deputies in
the' next twenty-four or forty-eight hours,
and in fact every person involved in the
outrage."
The three public schools that have been
closed Dy order of the Board of Health
will resume their classes this morning.
An order of court has been issued restrain
ing the deputies from interference, and if
they resist the order they will be in con
tempt of court.
The members of the Board of Educa
tion, as plaintiffs, yesterday applied to
the Superior Court for an injunction to
restrain the Board of Health from inter
fering with tbe plaintiffs' control of the
Everett Primary School, the Mission
lirammar School and the Marshall Pri
mary School.
The court (Judge Daingerfield), deem
ing the plaintiffs entitled to the relief de
fiined, issued an order directing the mem
bars-of the Board of Health to appear be
fore the court on Friday, December 11,
and show cause wbv their agents and
creputies should not be enjoined from in
tertering with the plaintiffs' management
-oi the schools.
. The court ordered further, that in the
rueautfaie and until the order to show
cause is determined the defendants, their
- s deputies and agents shall be restrained
â¢from interfering.
"CUBA, THE SEAT OF WAR."
Mrs. Frona Eunice 'Wait "Will Lecture
Friday Upon That Country.
"Cuba" will be the subject of a lecture
to be delivered thia evening by Mrs.
Frona Eunice Wait at the Y. M. C. A.
Auditorium.
Mrs. Wait has made a close study of
the subject, and has arranged to deliver
Mrs* Frona Eunice "Wahe.
lectures thereon at Sacramento for the
Camera Club, at Salt Lake City for the
Young Men's Improvement Club and
Denver lor the Historical Society.
Her lecture will be illustrated by 150
specially fine stereopticon views. Among
these will be a superb picture of Cabanas
Castle, where General Colima was foully
shot rerently ; Morro Castle, where vari
ous newspaper men were imprisoned aud
which is artistically and historically one
of the most interesting buildings in ihe
series; the cathedral at Havana, where
Columbus' remains repose, and many
other points of general interest.
From a natural sympathy with the in
surgent forces, Mrs. Wait has broueht a
p ofound interest in the country to bear
upon her subject, and expects to paint tbe
main features of the struggle for liberty
in a vivid style that will be appreciated
by all.

After an overture by the orchestra, H.
C. Gesford, the grand president of the
Naiive Sons', made a brief introductory
speech, in which he reviewed the progress
of the order and the work accomplished,
and pointed with especial pride to tbe
handsome and commodious hail they had
erected. He said there were 10,000 mem
bers of the order in the State and 4000 in
this City. His remarks were greeted with
applause.
Madame Emilia followed with a rendi
tion of "I'lncatrice," by Arditi. She was
encored and responded with another
classical selection.
As Iving M. Scott rose to deliver the
oration of the evening on "The Golden
Heritage of the Native Sons," he was
greeted with a spontaneous outburst of
applause. Near the close of his remarks
he drew aside the veil from the painting
amid profound silence, revealing the
beautiful pastoral scene portrayed on the
canvas. Tlie speaker was generously ap
plauded at every telling point he made
and at the clo-e of his speech. In part he
spoke as follows:
During his presentation address Mr.
Scott said :
At the time of the cession of California to
the United States it was unknown that the
ceded territory abounded in gold. Not until
1848, two years atter the cession, was gold
discovered. The news determined tens of
thousands of men in the prime of manhood,
and brave as the bravest of the Argonauts of
old, io quit the plow, the forge, the manu
factory, ihe country, and to seek the goldeu
fleece in the Golden West. They brought to
the New El Doraao immeasurable wealth, en
ergy and enterprise, genius, skill and sterling
virtue, the efficient means of developing upon
a large scale, the vast natural resources of the
country. For many years they added annually
to the world's stock of gold $50,000,000 and
upward. Not only so, but they felied lorests, ex
ploited quarries, and fashioned their wide ma
terial into cities, villages and happy homes
throughout tue length and breadth of the
land; they plained and reaped not only to the
extent of meeting their own requirements for
the necessaries, comforts and luxuries of life
but of supplying the wants of others in
many parts of the world; they gave existence
to a commerce that whitens with its sails
every sea oi the globe; they constructed man
ufactories whose products challenge those of
auy other country; when there was sterility
for want of rain they established irrigation
works to compensate the lack of Heaven's
bounties, and mere now obtain broad fields of
waving grain, orchards of or*nges and other
fruits, and vineyards extending beyond the
reach of vision; they established puolic
schools, academies and vying with the best in
other countries; in a word, they founded and
fashioned one of the most glorious Btaes in the
Unionâ "reared a monument more durable
thnn brass."
Native Sons of California, such are a few of
the many grand achievements of your lathers,
the fruits oi which are largely yours, or so to
become by inheritance.
The golden fleece of the ram Chrysomallus
is said to have been obtained by Jason and his
distinguished companion heroes through the
sorcery of Meaia and to have been borne off by
them from Colchis in the ship Argo.
The golden fleeces won in California by
your fathers, by their genius, skill and enter
priseâby honorable means, not sorceryâ would
laden to their utmost capacity many, many
fleets of Argos. J
If you would enjoy this natural wealth you
must bestow upon it your chief attentions
bestow them not in the spirit of miserly
hoarding, but In that of enierprise, in that o"f
improvementâ that of creating mid establish
ing new industries and encouraging new and
old, so as not only to benefit directly your
selves but to enrich the State and promote the
happiness of all within the scope of your effort.
In a broad sense wealth consists not only iv
an abundance of material things havsng'the
power of graiifying human desire, but in a
happy condition of life. Thus the true wealth,
the nature of your inheritance, involves not

only gold, lands, buildings, ships and store
houses filied with goods, but the institutions
of law and order, of security of persons and
property, of learning, in a wori tbe institu
tions of civilization.
It is a great mistake to conceive that the
golden age of California has passed. We are
in it. Much has been accomplished, but, in
mining phrase, it constitutes "a prospect" only
of the resources of California.
Since 1848 her mines have yielded gold to
the amount of approximately $1,400,000,000;
still her mountains are teeming with the pre
cious metal, exceeding evidently many times
that vast sum, aud are regarded by many con
versant with the matter the most inviting
goidfields in the world. Her mountains also
abound in silver, copper, iron, lead, quicksil
ver and other minerals, requiring but the
hand of industry.
Of her 35,000,000 acres of rich, arable lands
comparatively a small portion only is under
cultivation. Millions of acres of her swamp
aud overflowed lands can be rendered fertile
as ft garden.
Millions of acres of her lands, too, now arid
arc pronounced by gocd authority profitably
reclaimable by irrigation.
As a fruit-growing country California is
justly regarded unrivaled. Her dried-fruit in
dustry cannot well be overestimated, as it has
for its products the world for a market.
No good reason exists why the wine product
of California shall not equal, if not exceed,
that of France at her best; for our acreage
that may be devoted to that purpose is as ex
tensive as hers; our soil is new and rich, while
hers is worn and requires fertilization; our
climate is milder than hers.
The United States imports yearly more than
$100,000,000 worth oi sugar. Now, Califor
nia, without pressing in the least upon her
other industries, can, with a saving to the con
sumers aud with profit to herself, close up this
immense drain with beet-sugar products from
her own fields, and our wool industry is but in
its infancy.
Japan and China, for the development
which they are destined to attain, will require
naval and commercial fleets, lailroad mate
rial, machinery in great variety, grain and
other proaucts. In competition ior meeting
their requirements the advantage is largely In
our favor.
Mex;co, Central and South America abound
in forests of choice woods, and in other valua
ble vegetable products. Their mineral re
sources, as gold, silver, copper, tin, zinc, iron,
quicksilver, coal, and so on, are unlimited.
Now the immense resources of these coun
tries are to be developed; the broad, fertile
fields are to be tilled, the exhaustless mines
worked, the extensive forests of timber and
choici woods are to be felled and their ma
terial reared and fashioned into objects of
utility and beauty; the rare products that

minister to man's comforts or delight his
senses are to be gathered for his uses. To
effect these developments, manufactures to
the value of billions of dollars will be re
quired.
Sons of the golden West, it is largely within
the scope of your effort to furnish these manu
factures. For such Is the geographical posi
tion of California and such her condition as to
defy competition. Indeed, the future of Cali
fornia is rich laden with possibilities requir
ing but well-directed industry to attain the
full measure of their golden promises.
Artist Keith was then introduced and
modestly thanked those present for their
manifestations of appreciation. He was
followed by James D. Phelan in a brief
address accepting the painting in the
name of the Hall Association, and thank
ing Mr. Scott, the donor, both for his gen
erosity and the interest he took in tbe
order of Native Sons.
The programme was concluded with a
short poem by Dr. E. R. Taylor.
THE FOURTH CAVALRY.
Return of Troopers to the Presidio
From a Long Tour in the Moun
tains.
Troops B, C, I and X of the Fourth
United States Cavalry, under command of
Captain Alexander Kodgers, reached the
Presidio yesterday afternoon and went
into quarters there. The troopers camped
at Uncle Tom's Cabin Wednesday night.
They have been coming here from the
flanks of the Sierra by easy marches for
several weeks.
The four troops were concentrated near
Madera for maneuvers or problems, and
several problems were solved. The
cavalrymen passine through Fresno on
their homeward ride were entertained
hospitably by General Muller and the two
companies of the National Guard there
stationed.
The Presidio is now one of the most im
portant army posts in the United States.
The garrison consists of four batteiies of
artillery, four troops of cavalry and four
companies of infantry.

ARCHIE LEVY HAS
TAKEN A BRIDE
Miss Edna Smith Weds
the Amusement
Caterer.
She Is a Sister of Solly Smith,
the Well-Known
Pugilist.
A Romantic Courtship of but Four
Weeks Ends in Happy
Matrimony.
Archie Levy, the musical and theatrical
manager and composer, was married yes
terday by Justice of the Peace Barry, at
high noon, to Miss Edna Smith, a sister
of Solly Smith, tne pugilist. Miss Smith
1 is known to tue public as one of the win
some girb in the living pictures at the
People's Palace.
There is quite a little romance back of
the marriage which was a great surprise
to a majority of their frienda. Mr. Levy
furnishes talent for the various variety
theaters in this City and about the coast.
He "booked" Miss Smith for the Peo
ple's Palace four weeks ago and up to tl c
time she appeared had never seen her.
Her dark, flashing eyes, pretty fieure and
general attractiveness captivated him,
however, at first sight and he laid siege to
her heart without delay. The admiration
seemed mutual, and before long those
who knew thÂ«m began to note their devo
tion to each other. .
Yesterday a license was procured and,
with John W, Newbert, a friend of Mr.
Levy, as best man, and Mrs. Bertha
Durell, a friend of Miss Smith, to see her
through, they called on the Justice and
were united.
Mr. Levy has a comfortable home at
1111 Buchanan street, prepared lor bis
bride and there they will hold a reception
on Sunday next.
Solly Smith is on his way here from
New York to wish his slater joy. Miss
Smith is 18 and her husband 34 years of
age.
Mr. Levy booked Sliarkey all through
the East during his recent tour and will
manage Solly Smith in future.
THE HUDELSON LIBEL.
Attorney Wood worth Swears to Two
>ew Complaints, and the Original
Charge I* Dismissed.
Attorney D. U. Wood worth swore to two
new complaints in Judge Campbell's court
yesterday cbareing Benjamin F. Hudel
son with criminal libel. This was done
because on Tuesday the Judge decided
ti at the complaint sworn to by Wood
worth last Saturday was defective, inas
much as it covered too much ground and
was not specific enough.
The warrants wero served upon Hudel
son, and he and his bondsmen accompa
nied the officer to Judge Campbell's court,
where the Judfe accepted two bonds of
$1000 each for~his release. The charges
were entered against him in the City
Prison, and he walked away with his
bondÃmen.
The Judge dismissed tbe original case
against Hudelson, and he will appear this
morning in court to answer the two new
charges. One is that Woodworth was
hbeJed in an article in the California
Standard of July 18 last, and the other in
the same paper on September 5.

THE SAN BENITO WRECK.
Further Testimony on the Disaster
Near Point Arena.
The inquiry into the loss of the steamer
San Benito on the Mendocino coast on
November 21 was resumed before the
United States Inspectors of Steam Vessels
yesterday. J. W. Swan, second officer of
ttie wrecked vessel, testified that be was
on duty from 6 to 12 p. m. on the night of
the disaster. He described such points as
related to the weather, sea, compass, etc.,
his testimony being similar to that of
previous witnesses. Tne mate was in bed
at the time the vessel went upon the
rocks.
W. H. Jeffo, water-tender of the San
Benito, testified that he went on watch at
midnight of the eventful night. At that
time the vessel was running at full speed,
about fifty revolutions. He said that the
engines were reversed before tne shock
and they did not stop backing until a lit
tle before the vessel broke in two.
Gus Johnson, a quartermaster on the
same vessel, stated that after the vessel
struck the boats on the port side were
washed away before the crew could do
anything with tbeni.
SJAIi of the witnesses were closely ques
tioned upon the subject of the boats being
put out and which resulted in the loss of
five lives. The apparent object of this
lnquirv was to see if the master warned
tbe men aÂ«ainst such an undertakine.
Nearly all of the witnesses testified that
Captain Smith, while not prohibiting the
men from making an attempt to land in the
boats, strongly advised them to stay by
the ship.
The original statements or reports of
Captain W. Smith and Chief Officer Rich
ard Zolling were filed as a part of their tes
timony. In the captain's report he deals
with the detail? of the passage of the San
Benito from Tacoma alone the coast, and
adds: "Judged myself from courses steered
to pass fourteen miles off Point Arena
Light. Having looked well around, no
land, light or lights seen, retired to
rest."
After describing tbe striking of the ves
sel he adds: "Orders were given to get
port lifeboats out, which was done imme
diately, but the steamer broke in two and
brought port side of forward half to sea
ward ana the boais wera sweDt from the
davits. The starboard boats were then
put out and the crew were told that if any
of them wished to get iv them they could
go, but the bÂ«st plan seemed to be to re
main by the ship. However, the boats
were lowered with a portion of the crew in
each, but they capsizea before reaching
the shore and fivÂ« were drowned. Those
left on the vessel took to the forerigging
and were eventually rescued by the
steamers Point Arena and vVeeott and
Drought to San Francisco."
The statement or report of Chief Officer
Zolling corroborated that of the master as
to the course and incidents of the disaster.
His oral testimony was similar to that
presented by the other witnesses.
The case will bo resumed to-day.
