CHICAGO, 111., July 28.â William
Hahn of Mansfield, Ohio, ex-National
Committeeman and chief of the depart
ment of campaign speakers In 1892, ar
rived to-day at Republican National head
quarters to assume charge of the same
department. Mr. Hahn began nis duties
at once and will have speakers in the field
next week. He and Mr. Heath decideu to
leave the matter of vocal and instrumental
music of all kinds, as a campaign adjunct,
to the State and county committees.
Chaplain Lozier of lowa, the veteran
campaign singer, was the first caller on
Mr. Habn in search of engagement.
J. W. Johnson, an editorial writer from
Mr. Bryan's home, was engaged by Mr.
Heath to-day to write on political matters
which relate to the interests of "Nebraskans
only. He will work in Lincoln. He in-
formed Mr. Heath that arrangements
were being made by the State committee
of Nebraska to have a species of elemen
tary school to give lessons on the silver
issue in all the towns of the State, to be
operated by competent teachers day and
night.
The Republican College league of Clubs,
like the Republican National League of
fice, is to be merged with the National
headquarters here and in New York for
campaign purposes. Most of the work
will be done in the central Western States
and the distinctive organization of the
league by States and departments will be
prosecuted with vigor at once.
William R. Moore of Memphis, who was
a member of the forty-sevewth Congress,
called to say a lew word^about Tennessee
and other Southern States. To a United
Press reporter Mr. Moore said: "The
political conditions in Tennessee are pe
culiar this year. Lifelong Democrats in
Memphis, who are prominent merchants
and manufacturers, have come out for
.McKinley. These are of the old South,
not tne new, and it means much for the
change in public sentiment through the
South. The idea of protection is very
strong there, but the new converts qualify
. their statements by saying, 'I am not for
McKinleyism.' These men were rabid
free traders."
BOTH ARE VITAL ISSUES.
Chatrmnn Banna Say* Sound Money
and Protf-ction Go Hand in Hand.
NEW YORK, N. V., July 28. -M. A.
Hanna, chairman of the Republican Na
tional Committee, arrived to-day. He
had a lone consultation with the Republi
can leaders here. Headquarters for the
East were located in the Metropolitan In
surance Company building, in Madison
Square. The executive committee will
meet to-morrow.
To-night, in conversation with a United
Press representative, Mr. Hanna said that
hie position and Major McKinley's posi
tion was that the financial question and
the tariff question must go hand in hand.
They both recoenized, he said, that the
money question was a leading issue and
one that the Republican party would have
to meet. The kind of money the country
would have to use was only one part of
the question. Another part was the rais
ing of money to meet the expenses of the
Government.
"To put it briefly," he said, "our posi
tion is in favor oi sound money and a pro
tective tariff; and mind," he added, em
phatically, "I do not mean a high tariff
by any means."
He said, further, that their policy would
be to preserve the currency on a sound
basis of gold and at the same time to raise
sufficient money to defray all expenses of
the Government.
: As to the true position of Mr. McKinley
on the financial question Mr. Hanna
seemed anxious to be clear. He said be
wanted to impress on the minds of the
business men of the East the fact that the
managers of the Republican cambaign
were fully alive to the importance of tbe
great financial interests involved in the
currency question, but that both he and
McKinley thought the financial question
could be separated from the question of
tariff and tlie raising of sufficient revenue
â¢ for tbe needs of the Government.
Mr. Harma expressed himself as de
sirous of talking freely and fully to the
public through the newspapers, and he
means to do so as soon as the other mem
bers of the National Committee arrive and
he has a chance to confer with them.
ALLISON TO AID McKINLEY.

CHICAGO. 111., July 28.â Benator Alli
son came from his lowa home to-day and
stopped in Chicago on his way to an East
ern summer resort, where he will stay two
or three weeks, preparing himself physi
cally for active participation in the politi
cal campaign. In his room at the Audi
torium annex, the Senator received some
personal and political friends, among them
being Chief Heath of the National Publi
cation and Printing Bureau, with whom
he conferred as to plans for the most effec
tive campaign literature to be sent to the
electors of lowa.
â¢'The f r- c silver question is an old one,"
said the Senator. "It is the underlying
principle of greenbackism. It has been

rÂ«i sentiment among the Republicans
of my State, chiefly among the farmers,
but it will be overcome with plenty of good
literature and by the arguments of speak
ers among the wavering ones. They will
be found voting right on election day and
I have no doubt that lowa will give its
electoral vole for Major McKinley. Of
course the Republicans cannot quietly sit
down and await victory. It will not come
that way. I have found and learned of
many Democrats among the farmers and
in the cities who are going to vote for Mc-
Kinley because of rhe Republican declara
tion for sound money. I shall take the
stump in lowa after returning from the
East, and speak outside the State if I am
wanted."
CLEVELAND CAPITULATES.

WASHINGTON, D. C, July 28.-Bena
ator Harris' statement that Mr. Gorman
will be elected chairman of the Demo
cratic executive committee is a surprise to
those persons to whom Mr. Gorman has in
the past repeatedly declared that he would (
not accept a position on any committee.
It has been known and frequently stated
in these dispatches that Mr. Gorman
would practically manage the campaign
for Senator Jones and the coterie of aged
Democratic Senators who have always
loosed to the Maryland Senator to carry
into practical execution the plans con
cocted in the Democratic conference- room.
Mr. Gorman's fine management has been
seen in the postponement of the original
date of notification and the selection of
Washington for headquarters, and his
advice will be sought before any impor
tant step will be taken. It was generally
understood that Mr. Jones was to be
chairman of the executive committee, as
he is manager of the campaign. '
Senator Lindsay paid a hurried visit
here to-day, leaving again to-night. He
was one of the most ardent cuckoos in the
Senate, but will support the regular Demo
cratic ticket.
Representative Berry, who took Mr.
Carlisle's seat in the House and has al
ways been his faithful understudy, was
here to-day. He too announces that he is
for the regular ticket. It is inferred that
both these intimate friends of Mr. Carlisle
are in accord with the Secretary's views,
and that he will also vote the straight
ticket. It is now intimated that President
Cleveland is disappointed at the lack of
enthusiasm shown by his Cabinet for a
third ticket, and that he will take no pub
lic hand in the matter, permitting all his
office-holders to act according to their
own will.
Secretary Smith will preside at a Bryan
i Bewail ratification meeting in Atlanta
immediately after the notification meet
ing has been held at the Madison-square
Garden early next month. Senator Gor
man will preside at a similar meeting in
Laurel about the same time.
BRYAN IS SILENT.
He Jif/ium* to Talk About Accepting the
. Â . Populiatie -Nomination.
LINCOLN, Nebb.. July 28.â Senator
Petrigrew of South DuKota, one of the
bolting silver Republicans, was tae only
prominent caller at the Bryan residence
to-day. He took midday dinner with Mr.
and Mrs. Bryan and spent some hours
with the nominee talking over the political
situation. Mr. Bryan is still silent as to
his intentions with regard to the Populist
nomination. He is taking nobody in Lin
coln into his confidence on the subject.
Opinion here differs as to what he will do,
but the general understanding is that no
decision was to be reached until after
Senator Jones, chairman of the Democratic
National Committee, has consulted with
the Populist leaders as to the best course
to pursue. While in Chicago, Mr. Bryan
expressed to the National Committee his
desire to be guided by its advice, and while
he has his own opinions, he appears willing
to allow his political advisers to arrange
matters in a way that will be advantageous
to the free coinage cause. His statement
of last night showed bis desire for harmony
between all factions devoted to silver.
Mr. Bryan spent a short time at Demo
cratic headquarters this afternoon, but
did nothing beyond shaking hands with a
number of people there. He walked down
O street, the main thoroughfare of Lincoln
on his way home, and spoke to many old
friends on the way. Large photographs
of Mr. and Mrs. Bryan were sent to Mr.
and Mrs. Sewall to-day.
COLORADANN IS DOUBT.
Do JVot Knout Whether to ' Support Me-
Kinley or Bryan.
DENVER, Col., July 28 âThe Republi
can State Central Committee will meet to
morrow to arrange time and place for
holding the State convention to nominate
State officers and Presidential electors. â¢.
Interest in this meeting is keen, because
of a wide difference of opinion upon the
subject of officially indorsing the St. Louis
or the Chicago nominees. Senator Wol
cott's following wants the committee to
morrow, by resolution," to declare that
only such voters as will pledge themselves
to support the Republican National plat
form and ticket will be eligible to vote at
the primaries. By such means it is
thought the State convention will name
McKinlev electors. V,;
The Wolcott followers to-night assert
that they have a majority of the commit
tee. On the other hand there are two dif
ferent ideas extant, one to indorse Demo
cratic electors and one to waive all discus
sion of the question, leaving it to the State
convention to decide.

NEVADA CITY, Cal., July 28.-The

officer had shot the bandit's accomplice

Most of the men had returned by 11

o'clock last night, but some remained out
all night watching the roads and bridges
within a radius of twenty miles.
"Sleepy" Johnson, who was arrested
last night and is now in thÂ« County Jail
here, is suspected of knowing something
about the hunted bandit. Johnson bor
rowed a pistol yesterday, saying he was
going out to look for the robber. Subse
quently he told other persons that he in
tended to go to North Bloomh>ld to work.
Late In the afternoon, while tbe officers
and posse were hunting for the outlaw
about a mile from town, some of the
party met Johnson coming in the direc
tion of town, fie said be bad met a man
up the oad who stopped him and
ordered hi i to turn around and. go back.
This information led them to believe that
possibly the man be met was the one they
were looking for. Soon a skirmish line
half a mile long was formed and men be
gan scouriug the country in the imme
diate neighborhood. After beating over
about a mile of rough, brushy ground and
finding no trace of any one they concluded
they had been sent on a wild goose chase.
Johnson was taken along to point out
the spot where he encountered the stran
ger. He acted strangely and the officers
deemed it advisable to arrest him. He has
been around town about a month. When
the bodies of Sheriff Douglass and the dead
roboer were being removed to town yester
day Johnson was present and seemed anx
ious that the robber should not be han
dled too roughly, he getting into the
wagon to steady the body-
Johnson was implicated in the stealing
of a bicycle from Mayor Ellis at Marys
ville some time ago, and was arrested near
this city and lodged in jail here. He has
a bad record.
It was learned to-day that C. Meyers,
the dead robber, was an adopted son of
Theodore Winters, the noted horseman
and stock breeder. Meyers formerly fol
lowed the racing circuits, but in the past
tew years be has been reckless and disso
lute. He went from M?.rvsville to Grass
Valley about the first of July in company
with two men named Davis and Jenks.
Both of these men have returned to
Marysviile, jenks getting back about three
weeks ago, and Davis reaching there only
a few days ago. They were seen at Grass
Valley by a person who had seen them at
Marysviile. The officers at the latter place
will probably detain Davis until he can
give a good account of himself.
Detective Thomas Gibson of San Fran
cisco arrived this morning and positively
identified tbe dead robber as the man who
held him up two weeks ago to-day <m the
San Juan road near this city while he was
driving from North San Juan in a buggy,
accompanied by Charles Sladky. Gibson
gave a good description of the man at the
time of the robbery, and said his rifle had
an ivory bead front sight. The rifle found
with the dead robber had an ivory sight.
People from different par s or the
county have identified the robber. Sam
uel CJine of Rouj h and Ready says Mey
ers ate supper at his house on July 8.
Meyers said he was going to Oroville on
the 9th. Cline went io work in a hay field,
locking his house. When he returned he
found the house broken inco and his rifle
and cartridge-belt gone.. He identified the
rifle found beside the outlaw as the one
taken from his place.
Meyers was buried here this afternoon.
Under Sheriff Pascoe returned to town
after 12 o'clock lust night, and all uneasi
ness as to his safety was dispelled. He
had taken a different route from the other
searchers and went alone, coming back by
way of Grass Valley.
The funeral of Sheriff Douglass will take
place to-morrow afternoon at 3 o'clock,
irom Armory Hall. It will be the largest
ever lield here. All business places here
and at Gra<s Valley will close while the
funeral is in progress, and a Rpeeial train
will be run from tbe latter town. To-day
all flags were floating at half mast in re
spect to bis memory. The funeral will be
held under the auspices of the Knights oi
Pythias and Native Sons.
Tne Sheriff's widow and little son ar
rived this morning from San Francisco by
special train.
REARED IN AFFLUENCE.
George Winter*' Career in California
and Nevada.
WOODLAND. Cal., July 28.â The hi_h
wayman killed by Sheriff Douglass in Ne
vada County was George \\ inters, a for
mer Yolo boy. Twenty years ago young
Winters lived with his stepfather, Theo
dore Winters, the well-known horse
breeder and millionaire, on the latter's
magnificent estate near the town of Win
ters, which was named in his honor. As
a boy he was continually committing mis
chief of all kinds. He was educated in
the common scuools, and when Theodore
Winters moved to Nevada he placed his
son in charge ot one of his stock ranches.
A prominent resident of this city who
resided in Nevada in the eighties is quite
familiar with George Winters' career in
the Silver State. Winters bore an unenvi
able reputation. He was reckless and
daring. In boundary disputes he showed
no mercy to settlers. An old man located
on a section of land a^joinins: Winters'
ranch, and his land was so located that
the Winters were compelled to drive stock
across it to reach their ranee. The aged
settler finally forbade them crossing his
land. In short tim? he was killed. It
was charged that young Winters employed
cowboys to murder him.
Winters was arrested, but discharged,
as the evidence was not sufficient to con
vict. It is said that one of the men who
killed the settler confessed a few years
ago, and said he was hired to commit the
deed by Winters. Winters continued in
charge of the ranches until a few years
a<ro. when he came to California, and his
acquaintances heard nothing of him until
the news of his killing by Sheriff Douglass
was received. He is described as having
been a remarkably fine-looKing man when
he was your.g.

After Six Hours' Deliberation
the Jury Finds a Verdict

SENTENCED TO VARIOUS TERMS
The Doctor Must Languish for Fifteen
Months, the Others Shorter
Periods
LONDON, Enq., July 28.â The case of
Dr. Jameson, Sir John Willoiighby, Major'
Raleigh Gray, Colonel H. F. White, Major
R. White and Hon. Henry F. Coventry,
who took prominent pans in the recent
raid into the Transvaal, was continued
this morning before Lord Chief Justice
Russell. Yesterday counsel for the defense
and prosecution submitted ;heir cases, and
at half-past 10 o'clock this morning Lord
Chief Justice began to sum up. Lord
Russell said there had been no attempt to
gainsay the statements of witnesses for the
prosecution, but if the jury had any real
doubt as to the nature of the defendants'
acts they must give them the benefit of it.
The jurors remained in their room until
s:2s o'clock, when they filed into the court
room and in response to a question by the
clerk announced that they had agreed
upon a verdict, which was "guilty,"
against all the defendants.
After the usual formalities had been
complied with the court sentenced Dr.
Jameson to fifteen months' imprisonment,
Major Sir John Willoiighby to ten months,
Colonel White to seven months and the
other defendants to three months' im
prisonment each. None of the prisoners
will be compelled to do hard labor during
their incarceration.
A large crowd had gathered outside the
courtroom to await the exit of the prison
ers, and cheered vociferously when they
made their appearance. Many shouts of
"Gcd bless yen!" were heard as the pris
oners were brought out on their way to
Holloway Jail, where they are to be con
fined temporarily.
Jameson and nis fellow-prisoners were
placed in cells in the jail, where they were
dressed in the garb of ordinary convicts
and received the common prison fare.
Their treatment will differ in no way irom
that of other prisoners unless their appeal
for first-class treatment be granted.

INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., July 27.â The
efforts of the Indiana Democratic leaders
to induce the State Populist Convention,
held to-day, to fuse on the Democratic
ticket, were defeated by an overwhelming
majority. While only 350 delegates were
present out of 1400 expected, it was ar
rangea in some manner so that votes were
cast for the absent ones.
When the convention was called to order
this morning, N. T. Butts was made tem
porary chairman, and after the appoint
ment of committees, a recess was taken.
On reassembling in the afternoon, Mr.
Landers, an Indianapolis Democrat was
recognized and made a speech, saying that
if the Populists would indorse the Demo
cratic ticket, they would be given repre
sentation on the legislative ticket, and thia
would insure a free silver Senator from
Indiana. After Mr. Landers had finished,
the permanent chairman. Dr. Motsinger,
said he did not consider it wise for the
Populists to allow their party to be swal
lowed up by the Democrats or any other
political body, and urged a separate ticket.
After much discussion, Delegate Wal
ters of Clinton County read a dispatch re
ferring to the Tennessee Populist conven
tion, and moved that a message be sent to
the Tennessee Populists saying that In*
diana indorses tbe work of the St. Louis
convention and the nominees there
named. A scene of great confusion fol
lowed, but Walters' motion carried 389 to
397. This was a great victory for the mid
dle-of-the-road men.
Chairman Motsinger thanked the con
vention and said: "There are enough.
Populists here to snow under all the fu
sionists in Christendom."
The platform was then read and adopted
with practical unanimity. It reaffirms de
votion to the essential principles of the
National platforms of 1892 and 1896, de
clares that our National affairs have
reached a crisis threatening the life of the
Republic, and says the contraction of the
National currency is the principal cause
of financial ills. The unrestricted coinage
of both gold and silver is demanded on
equal terms at the present legal ratio of 16
to 1, without waiting for the consent or
concurrent action ot foreign powers; also
the indiscriminate use of both the metals
in paying Government obligations, which
by law are paid in coin.
Government ownershiD of railroad,
telegraph and telephone lines is favored,
and an amendment to the constitution
demanded granting the privilege of direct
legislation through the initiative and.
referendum.
The platform concludes with the de
claration that "the People's party of In
diana is emphatically in favor of main
taining its organization, National, State
and local."
The State ticket nominated is a follows:
Governor, Thomas A. Wadsworth; Lieu
tenant-Governor, A. P. Hanna; Secretary
of State, Silas M. Holcomb; Auditor, N.
M, Jennings; Treasurer, J. F. S. Robin
son; Attorney-General, T. D. Fernandez.
It was after 11 o'clock this evening when
tbe convention took up the mooted ques
tion of what it should do about the Presi
dential electors. A. J. Johnson offered a
resolution that the convention appoint a
committee of one from each district,
clothed with full power to act for the
party. As Johnson was one of the leaders
of the "middle-of-the-road" faction, it "was
spposed that this would go through with
out friction. J. W. Newbern offered a
substitute doubling in size the committee
and giving it full power to arrange a
fusion of electors in filling vacancies on
the State ticket and fusing on Con
gressional and legislative tickets. Then a
wrangle started which lasted until I
o'clocs Wednesday morning. It was
ended by the adoption of Johnson's mo
tion refei ring the matter of electors to a
committee of thirteen with power to act.
TENNESSEE POPULISTS.
Fusion Overtures Made to Jtemocrats by

NASHVILLE, Term., July 28.â The
Tennessee Populist Convention met here
at noon to-day. It was small in point of
attendance, there not being more than 130
delegates present and its proceedings were
watched with unusual interest by leaders
of the other two parties. Prominent Re
publicans and Democrats from all over the
State were here.
The convention indorsed the action of

WILL POOL THEIR SPEAKERS.
Allied Silver Forces Will Hold Combina-
tion AlasÂ«-Meetings.
DENVER, Col., July 23.â Leaving Kan
sas City yesterday morning at 10:55 I
came through Northern lowa and Colo
rado on the Chicago, Rock Island and
Pacific, making it a point to ascertain, in
an unobtrusive way, the sentiments of
people on the nominations made by the
Populists at St Louis. I have to relate
two incredible things: First, that I found
but one outspoken goldbug among the
many travelers on the train ; second, not
one in ten made the remotest reference to
the Vice-Presidential candidate. Great
interest was shown in the fact that Bryan
had been nominated by tne Populists and
1 never heard a doubt expressed all day
long as to bis election.
Continuing my review of the events
which made the second Populist Conven
tion just held at St. Louis significant and
unique above any other National conven
tion yet held in this country, and which
plainly indicates the inauguration of a
new era in our political history, I draw
attention now to the notable departure
in campaign work made at the great Dem
ocratic ratification meeting on Saturday
night at St. Louis, only a fe.v hours after
the Populist Convention had nominated
Bryan and adjourned. Note the signifi
cance of the tact that that meeting was
called and presided over by ths chairman
of the Democratic National Committee,
Senator Jones of Arkansas, it being the
first formal ratification meeting he has at
tended. We now come to note the speak
ers selected by the chairman to address
this chief Democratic ratification meeting.
First, we have an able and broadgauge ad
dress by Chairman Jones, which was con
spicuously free from partisan spirit. Then
came Bland, who spoke on Bland and sil
ver. These are two great Democratic
leaders. They were followed by Senator
Allen, chairman of the Populist National
Convention, which had just closed its
work and adjourned. He was introduced
as a Populist by Chairman Jones, and
made a Populist speech. He was followed
by C. E. Towne of Minneapolis, vice-chair
man ol the Silver convention, a silver Re
publican. Then came Senator Stewart
and Jerry Simpson, noted as Populists,
followed by ex-Governor Johnson, a lead
ing Democrat.
So far as the chairman of the National
Committee can set the pace and outline
the plan of campaign, there is to bean
actual union of allied silver forces, and the
platform is to be occupied at campaign
meetings by speakers of all the allied
forces. It remains to be seen if State
Democratic managers are going to act in
good faith toward these allies, as Chair
man Jones has so conspicuously done.
Good faith and fraternal spirit in actual
practice alone will make this a campaign

SENATOR JONE'S WON'T TALK.
Refuses to Dirulge tne Contents of the St.
Louis lele'jrfm Fron% Bryan.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., July 28.â Senator Jones
of Arkansas returned here from his visit to
Mr. Bryan at Lincoln last evening, and
left on a late train for his home at Wash
ington, Ark. When asked about the au
thenticity of the telegram sent out by the
Associated Press, purportinc to have been
sent to him by Bryan to be red to the con
vention, he replied: "I don't know any
thing about it." The printed telegram
' was shown him, but he would not read it.
The reporter then began to read the tele
gram to him.
"I never received that," he interrupted,
after a sentence or two had been read.
"It is a stagger at it, but it is not the tele
gram."
"\vili you give out the real telegram?"
"No, I haven't that telegram to give
you. You can find Mr. Bryan's attitude
in his published interview of Saturday
night. I have nothing more to give out,'"
he said as he went to his sleeping-car.
In consequence of Mr. Jones' departure
there will be no conference for some time
between himself and the members of tne
People's party executive committee.

that the active Democrats, as well as those
who have convictions, are earnestly in

DEMOCRATS DISAGREE.
Controversy in Wisconsin Over the Dele
gation's Action at Chicago.
MILWAUKEE, WiÃ.. July 28.â The sil
ver delegates |to the Democratic conven
tion yesterday afternoon gave out their
address to the public, replying to the letter
published by the gold delegates, headed
by Vilas and Bragg. It is devoted mainly
to answering the statements promulgated
by the gold men, but goes to some extent
into the merits of the silver question. The
point is made that the silver delegates
obeyed their instructions until the chair
man of the Wisconsin delegation refused
to allow the vote of the State to be cast for
any Presidential candidate, ana that
they then obtained permission from the
presiding officer of the convention to cast
their votes. The letter is as follow*:
The Democratic party ever ha? and to the
end of its existence ever will advocate honest
money and oppose its debasement. To assert
that the Chicago convention declared In favor
of compelling the citizens of the United States
to receive dollars of only one-half value is a
wicked slander. The Democratic National
platform does not submit to the American peo
ple a new aid untried system of finance for
doption.
The great Hamilton and greater Jefferson
framed the law at the time of the birth of this
Nation, which gave to both gold ana silver the
right of free and unlimited coinage and made
both these metals fundamental and redemp
ton money. The integrity of this American,
this Democratic monetary system, was relig
iously preserved by all American legislators
from 1792 to 1873. In this latter year, when
the attention of the American people was di
verted from the subject, dishonest legislators
(surreptitiously demonetized silverâ the peo
nlc's money. The great American Nation,
without its knowledge or consent, had its
monetary system changed from bimetallism
to gold monometallism. The function of meas
uring values supporting commerce and credit
imposed upon gold and silver was by the de
monetization of silver shifted to gold alone.
The importance of gold was increased twofold,
as the demands upon it were doubled, and as
a result all commodities of the world declined
in value as expressed In golden dollars.
The merchant who has had bankruptcy
slowly but Burely creep upon him in spite of
his every effort and economy; the tiller of the
soil who has seen the products of his farm
gradually reach a price below the cost of pro
duction, in spite of his ceaseless care and toll ;
the man who depends upon his daily labor to
furnish him necessaries of life and appeals in
vain for the Drivllege to do workâ all ask why,
in a land of plenty, in a nation peopled with
willing workmen, in a country of limitless re
sources, why is there widespread business dis
aster and cruel want?
History records prosperity from the birthday
of America to 1873 under a bimetallic system
of finance. A silver dollar at all times during
that period equaled and in fact exceeded &
gold dollar in value. The day Congress by law
closed the doors of our mints on silver and
said thereafter gold shall measure the value of
all things, even silver, then it was that gold
grew dear and silver cheap, and as silver de
preciated so has the price of alt commodities
fallen as measured in gold until ruin stares
great and free America in the face. The Demo
cratic National Convention, in response to the
call for help from the people, has promised to
reinstate the money oi tne constitution and
thereby lift the golden yoke from America's
neck.
In conclusion the Democrats of the
State are urged to get together and see to
it that silver men are sent to the State
Convention.
POPULISTS DISSATISFIED.
They Do Mot Want to Indorse the Entire
Illinois Democratic Ticket.
CHICAGO, 111., July 23.â Before leav
ing this city to-day foj Springfield Gov
ernor Altgeld talked about the reports
that the Populists, in State convention, in
tended to nominate the Democratic State
ticket, minus Mr. Trude, nominee for At
torney-General, whom the Populists do
not seem to favor. Tne Governor said he
would under no circumstances accept an
indorsement or nomination from the Pop
ulists unless the whole ticket was in
cluded. Dr. Taylor, chairman of the Pop
ulist Cook County Committee, said there
would be iasion if the Populists were
recognized properly.
KENTUCKY GOLD DEMOCRATS.
They A' c Preparing for a Third Party
Cunrention I his Month .
LOUISVILLE, Ky., July 28.âRepre
sentative gold Democrats of the State met
hpre to-day and effected an organization.
The meeting was largely attended and
much interest manifested. The action of
the sound-money men at Chicago was rati
fied and the platform of the Chicago
Democratic Convention was roundly de
nounced. It was decided to hold a State
convention in Louisville on Thursday,
August 20, for the purpose of selecting
delegates to the National convention and
Presidential electors.
Formers Who Want Free Silver.
CHICAGO, 111., July 28.â A Terra
Haute (Ind.) special says: The first real
free silver demonstration took place yes
terday, when twenty-four wagons loaded
with corn for a hominy mill wheeled
through the city, making a parade several
blocks in length. On the sides of every
wagon were signs like these: "For Bryan/ 1
"We're all for free silver," "Give us free
silver and we'll get 50 cents for corn and
$1 for wheat." Mr. Blocksom, who owns
the farm on which the grain was raised, is
a free-silver roan. Many Republican
farmers are for Bryan.

SILVEBITES LOSING GROUND.
A Prominent Nebraskan Says That
Bryan Will Be Unable to Carry
His State.
WASHINGTON, D. C, July 28âThe
National Silver party has established its
headquarters in the Corcoran building,
Washington. George P. Keeney of Cali
fornia, an organizer for the Silver party
and an attendant upon the St. Louis con
vention, is now en route to this city and
will assume charge of affairs when he ar
rives. It is the intention of the commit
tee to take an active part in the cam
paign by sending out literature and speak
ers. There is some talk of practically
merging the Silver committee with the
regular Democratic committee and using
one as an auxiliary to the other. This
consolidation, however, cannot be ar
ranged until after the Democratic National
Committee shall have held its forthcom
ing meeting here. The last named com
mittee will not be in operation for two
weeks yet.
Representative Smith of the Twentieth
Illinois District spent some time to-day at
Republican Congressional headquarters.
He believes that public sentiment is rap
idly arif ting in favor of the Republicans.
The Republicans of his section have fallen
into line and normal conditions now pre
vail. He feels sure that McKinley and
the entire Republican ticket will be given
its oldtime majority there. Mr. Smith
has no fears for the State being led away
by either Populism or Altgeldism.
Vice-Chairman Apsley was at his desK
after a brief trip to hi 3 home. He pro
nounces the statement that free-silver sen
timent is growing in Massachusetts to be
nothing but rubbish and nonsense. The
laboring classes of that State will have
nothing to do with the heresy, and many
of those now employed in factories, who
under ordinary circumstances vote the
Democratic ticket, will this year be found
in the Republican ranks. The working
man above all things else desires to see
the return to prosperity, full time, higher
wages and fair profits for his employer.
W. Â¥. Gurley, a prominent attorney and
campaigner of Omaha, was among those
who called on the Republican committee
to-day. He expects to go on the stump and
work for the success of the ticket chosen
at St. Louis, and believes that with an
active, thorough, carefully conducted cam
paign Nebraska will select Republican
electors.
"In Nebraska, as much as any Western
State," said Mr. Gurley, "the silver ques
tion has been discussed in all its phases.
The sentiment in favor of the free coinage
has reached its climax and is on the wane.
Bryan made his last campaign for Con
gress on ihe silver issue alone, and came
so nearly being defeated that he refused
to again be a candidate. In his campaign
for United States Senator he stumped the
State with Mr. Thurston, and both speak
ers paid especial attention to silver. As a
result of the canvass a pronounced Repub
lican Legislature was elected. 1 think that
is a good straw to indicate the direction of
the wind. In that election Populists and
Democrats combined in many districts
upon legislative candidates, but notwith
standing that combine were unable to con
trol the Legislature."
TAMMANE'S BAND SHOWN.
Xew Tork and Brooklyn Democratic
Delegates Faror Bryan.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jnly 28.â The
World to-morrow morning will say: The
members of tlie Democratic State Com
mittee were interviewed by World re
porters yesterday on tne political outlook
in the State. They were especially asked
if they favored the indorsement of the
Chicago ticket and platform by the State
Convention, which meets in Buffalo
September 16. A poll of the committee
resulted as follows:
Members of committees, 50; in favor of
indorsement 24, opposed to indorsement
4, non-committal 22. Many of the com
mitteemen from New York City and
Brooklyn were among the non-committal.
It is believed, however, that when the
convention meets the delegates from New
York and Kings counties will be solid for
indorsement of the Chicago ticket. There
are about eight members of the State Com
mittee opposed to indorsement, but not
all of them wish to goon record at present.
REUNITED IN MICHIGAN.
Warring Democratic Factions Decide to
Work Together for Bryan.
DETROIT, Mich., July 28.â Contrary to
expectations the meeting of the Demo
cratic btate Central Committee to-day
ended harmoniously. The warring jtold
and silver factions came together and will
work for the election of the Chicago nom
inees. This result was brought about by
the refusal of the committee to accept the
resignation ofsQhairraan Elliott G. Stev
enson, who \ras the leader in the fleht for
gold in the State convention and at Chi
cago. After this action was taken Mr.
Stevenson declared that the committee
would open the campaign in Michigan at
once, making silver the ieading issue and
fighting the battle out earnestly and hon
estly for l3ryan and Sewall.
WATSON'S GOLD FRONT.
Will Make Xo Overtures for Democratic
Support.
NEW YORK, N. V., July 28âThe Her
ald publishes the following from Augusta,
Ga. : Thomas E. Watson is disposed to
put a bold face on the situation here and
to see it out with an independent air. He
gives the Democrats notice that if they do
not want to vote for him for Vice-Presi
dent they need not swing on the Popu
lists' gate. If they are ready for a fair
division of the electors, so is he. If not,
then two sets of electors will be in the
field.
Termont's Populitt Ticket.
MONTPELIER, Vx., Jaiy 28.â The Pop-
ulist State Convention to-day nominated
a State ticket headed by Joseph P. Battle
of Middlebury for Governor. The plat
form declares for free stiver at 16 to 1 ; in
dorses "the principles of the people's
platform as enunciated in the People's
party platform adopted in St. Louis."
WILL SEWALL WITHDRAW?
Populist anal Democratic Committeemen
Confer to That End.
NEW YORK, N. V., July 23.â A Times'
special from Topaka, Kans., says:
John A. Briedenthal, a member of the
Populist executive committee, says that
the Democratic and Populist committees
will pet together and arrange matters be
tween Sewall and Watson and that the
former will withdraw and thus obviate all
trouble in arranging electoral tickets.
When Breidenthal was asked if he had
assurances that Sewall would withdraw,
he refused to give a direct answer. He
insisted, however, that there would be but
one candidate for Vice-President at the
polls.
GIANT POWDER EXPLOSION.
Great Havoc Is Mysteriously Wrought
at rictor, Colo.
VICTOR. Colo., July 28.â About 10
o'clock this morning an explosion of
giant powder laid on the sidewalk in
front of the Victor Hardware Comnany's
store caused great damage to all property
situated at the corner of Victor avenue
and Third street. The Bank of Victor and
the adjoinine hardware store suffered
heavy damage. The glass in the build
ings adjoining the Victor Hardware Com
oany's property was demolished and the
fronts of several buildings were com
pletely blown out. How the powder ig
nited is a mystery, as there were no fires
or combustible matter near II The
damage is estimated at $5000. Seven per
sons were slightly injured, while Michael

SPLAN'S CLOSE CALL.
The yotcd Horseman lxcice Stabbed by a
Discharged Employe.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, July 29.â John
Splan, the noted horseman, had a narrow
escape for bis life to-day at his home in
Glenville. Oliver Russell, a young man
who has been doing odd jobs for Splan,
was discharged for using abusive. language
to Mrs. Splan, and when Splan went into
the house to get the money to pay Rus
sell the latter drew a knife and plunged it
into Splan's back. Splan turned and grap
pled Russell, but was again stabbed in the
right arm. Splan managed to set hold of a
heavy whip and knocked down bis assail
ant. Splan's wounds, while serious, are
not fatal. Russell was locked up.
PETTY STRIFE IN HAWAII.
Frivolous Charges Are Preferred
Against Captain Good by
His Colonel.
The Captain Will Likely Be Found
Guilty, but the Public Is
With H m.
HONOLULU, Hawaii, July 21.â The
arrest of Captain John Good on the 13th
inst., which at the time caused consider
able surprise, but wa% thought to be of
little importance, has developed the fact
that more or less friction has occurred in
the military service since the Government,
rather hastily, it is thought, imported
Colonel McLean, late of the United States
naval service, to take command of the
forces here. Colonel McLean has been in
the country only a few months, during
which time, it is alleged, he has been bis
own worst enemy and has made few
friends.
McLean was imported from the United
States on the recommendation of ex-
Minister Thurston shortly after the last
revolution to unseat the republic. He
arrived, it is charged, with prejudices
against Captain Good, and the present
court-martial trial is tne first overt effort
to force Captain Good out of the service.
This statement comes from officers high
in the service who helped establish the
republic side by side with the arrested
captain.
Three charges are entered against Cap
tain Good, all of which Ere considered to
be more or less frivolous by military men.
It is quite likely the court will be obliged
to find the captain guilty, as the charges
mentioned can be proved. In speaking of
the trial, which begins to-night, one of the
court officials said this morning:
"That is just it. We will likely have to
convict the captain under military rules of
saying ti at if the Government reduced
salaries in th 9 army they should get less
work; thut he (Captain Good) did not
want any more d tailor dri;l, etc. But
what then? We simply cor.vict him for
telling the truth, and must also find that
Captain Good, if guilty of indiscretion,
has done nothing to warrant his dis
missal from the service. It is unfortu
nate that Colonel McLean, a comparative
s'ranger, should carry personal spite so
far as to embroil the entire military."
This statement represents the general
feeling outside of perhaps Colonel Mc-
Lean and a local newspaper, to which, it
ia publicly charged, the colonel has fur
nished some very queer statements of the
origin and progress of toe disagreement.
Captain Good is well known here, ana it
will be hard to influence the public against
him, no matter wnat action is taken by
Colonel McLean or what result is reached
by the pending court-martial.

PROHIBITIONIST
NOTIFICATION,
Joshua Levering Officially
Told of His Nomi

WILL FIGHT THE SALOON
Hard Times in the United States
Charged to the Liquor
Traffic.
SILVER QUESTION DISCUSSED.
Import Duties Compared to the Esti
mated Amount Spent Yearly
for Stimulan-s
BALTIMORE, Md., July 28.â At the
Lyceum Theater to-night the Prohibtion
party, through Rev. O. W. Stewart, chair
man of the notification committee, ap
prised Joshua Levering of his nomination
as candidate of the Prohibition party for
President. Mr. Stewart, in his notifica
tion speech, said the party should con
tinue to fight the saloon with its attend
ant distresses. Mr. Levering in reply
read his letter of acceptance, which was
as follows:
Oliver W. Stewart Esq. and gentlemen of
tho committee: It is with feelings of deep
emotion that I stand in this presence this
evening to accept the nomination for the
Presidency of the United States which you ten
der me on behalf of and by the authority of
the National Prohibition Convention, which
recently aasembled in the city of I'ittsburg.
I beg to express my sincere appreciation of
the honor thus conferred and to assure you
that it is esteemed all the more highly be
cause of the unanimity of action which
marked the convention. Such an honor is
worthy the ambition of any citizen of this
great Nation, but to my mind it is to be
douoly appreciated when tendered by the
only political party which has had the courage
to stand openly for the protection of the home,
the womanhood and the childhood of our
country against the terrible ravages aud de
struction of the legalized liquor traffic.
The platform adopted by the convention
meets my hearty approval, and though based
on the single issue is in reality sufficiently
broad to allow all to stand on it who are op
posed to the saloon and its consequent evils,
regardless of their views on any of the other
public questions of the day.
It is trueâ andno thinking man, regardless
of his surroundings or residence, can for a
moment doubt itâ that very many of tho peo
ple of our beloved land, and especially those
engagei in industrial and farming pursuits,
are suffering from the general depression so
widely prevalent at the present, and also that
there hÂ»8 not been a time since the memor
able days just preceding the breaking out of
the Civil War when these difficulties weighed
so heavily upon the people, or when there wes
so much unrest and dire foreboding for the
future as exists to-day.
The products of the soil, the mainstay of the
Nation's prosperity and wealth, are bo low in
value in many instances as not to pay the cost
of production, leaving nothing for the labor of
the toiler or for the capital invested. Many
persons hold the opinion that the cause of all
tills trouble is overproduction. But can such
an explanation be true? Is not the thought
an impious one ? Can any one who believes
in a beneficent Creator believe that he be
stows a bountiful harvest to be a curse rather
than a blessing to mankind? No, no: perish
the thought! The reasou of ail the prevalent
trouble in our fair land to-day is not over
production, but underconsumption. That
being so, where is there a cause which pre
vents the consumption of the necessities, to
say nothing of the luxuries, of life comparable
to the liquor traffic?
V.'c are told by the advocates of one of the
political parties that a high tariff is the pan
acea of all our ills, and yet the average annual
receipts from customs for the three years end
ing June 30, 1894, when the McKinley tariff
bill was in operation, were only $171,000,000,
less than $250 per capita of our population.
Others tell us that the free and unlimited
coinage of silver will be the cureall of the
evils affecting our people. It Is strange such
an idea should ba entertained, when the tact
is recalled that the total output of silver in
this country for the last year was only $60,
--000,000, a sum much less than the annual
product, of the familiar barnyard fowl. How
utterly insignificant are either of these figures
compared to the $1,200,000,000 which, it is
reliably estimated, is the direct yearly tribute
the peopie of this country pay to the support
of the liquor trafficâ a stupendous sum and so
large as to be difficult of realizing. It is
nearly twice as large as the aggregated capital
of all our National banks, or, to state it more
plainly, it is equal to about 75 per cent of the
entire money, gold, silver and paper currency,
of the United States. Let this vast sum of
money, which is now spent yearly in this way
and for which no value is received, but, on
tre contrary, is only adding to the suffering of
the people in varied and manifold forms, be
turned Into the channels of legitimate trade,
in the purchase of those things which will
brinir comfort and happiness to the home and
family. Then I belisve the troubles which are
now weighing so heavily upon them will be
largely things of the past, and until it is done
no real relief can be expected.
While thus emphasizing the results of the
liquor traffic as it exists to-day in our midst,
and the absolute necessity for its suppression
for beverage purposes, If peace and prosperity
and the blessing of God are to rest upon and
abide with our people, I don't underestimate
the fact that there are other questions of grave
importance over which the public mind is
seriously agitated, and which are being
pressed for speedy settlement. There is the
question of a stable and at the same time an
elastic currency, equal to the demands of busi
ness in every section of the country, and yet
every dollar of which should be of equal value
and the whole based on a standard equal to the
best in the world. The United States cannot
afford without dishonor to have money bear
ing its stamp inferior to that of auy country
on the globe.
The question of maintenance of the credit
of the Government, on which itc honor is
based and for which every one worthy of the
name of an American is or should be pro
foundly jealous, is one of vast importance.
Again, a proper adjustment of the tariff, so
that labor can have its just protection without
at the same time giving undue protection to
the manufacturing interest at the expense of
the great consuming portion of our people, is
worthy of profound consideration and early
solution.
The question of favoritism in legislation,
whereby trusts, monopolies and corporations
are fostered and protected to the detriment of
the interests of the people at large, is a vital
one and should have earnest and prompt con
sideration as a matter of common justice to an
oppressed people.
The strained relations existing between vari
ous foreign countries as well as between some
of them and their dependencies require the
exercise tot broad statesmanship in the con
duct of our foreign policy, so that while main
taining the honor of our country and afford
ing the amplest protection to every citizen of
our Jtepubiio, there shall be manifested that
fairness and magnanimity which a stronger
nation should ever show toward a weaker
power.
These and other matters of importance af
fecting the best interest oi all the citizens of
the country demand attention.
For myseif, 1 can only say that should the
\ i
voters of the United States see fit to call me toj
the duties and responsibilities of tlje high and '
exalted position of the chief magistracy of this j
Nation, the greatest on the lace of uÂ»eÂ»wwÂ»ti, I |'
can only promise, in the fear of God and in re- j
liance upon the guidance of the Holy Spirit, to
discharge these duties to the best of my abii- ;
lty, with en eye single to his glory and for the j
good of the people of every section of our land
without favor or partiality.
I now leave the matter to the decision 01 my
fellow-citizens, to be expressed at the ballot
box In November, and to the guidance of him
"who is the final arbiter of all things."
UNION MINERS BARRED.
Four Companies of Telluride District, Colo.,
/aaue a Notice to This
Effect.
TELLURIDK, Colo., July 28.â A repre
sentative of the Miners' Union has been
in this district for several days organizing
the miner.-;. Rumors of the movement
having reached the ears of ihe big opera
tors, they issued a formal notice to-day to
the effect that no union miner would be
employed. This was signed by the Tom-
Boy, the Smuggler- Union, the Japan ana
the Columbia- Menona companies by their
respective managers. The reasons stated
were that the highest wages have been
paid and that miners' unions always cause
trouble. To-night the miners are holding
a meeting up at the mines in Marshall
Basin and trouble is undoubtedly brewing
for to-morrow. Over 500 miners are em
ployed on these four properties.
WOMAN'S DAY AT CLEVELAND.

CLEVELAND, Ohio, July 28.â This was

the National Council ol* Jewish Women,
Mrs. Helen Campbell and others.
At this afternoon's session, presided over
by Mrs. Elroy M. Avery, addresses were

President Cowlea of the Chamber of Com- ]
raerce, Kate Brownlee Sherwood and
Harriet Taylor Upton.
Thia evening there was a reception in

and Mrs. McKinley, Mrs. M. A. Hanna
and Governor and Mrs. Bushnell. Major
McKinley shook hands with several hun- i
dred women and listened to pretty '
speeches from all of them. The day close 1 j

about 600 were present. A few men were
scattered about at the various tables.
Major McKinley was heartily applauded \
when he entered and when he left.
FLORIDA'S RACE RIOT.
Precipitated by a White Man Hugging a
Negro's Wife.
JASPER, Fla., July 28.â Advices from
Haggard's turpentine still, the scene of
the race riot Saturday night, state that
matters are in an unsettled condition and
that there may be further trouble. All
the negroes have left the turpentine farm
and Haggard will be forced to close down
at a loss of thousands of dollars. There is
considerable feeling against Haprgard on
the part of some of the whites. They
seem to think that Haggard sympathizes
with the negroes and knows where some
of them are secreted.
A committee of white men waited upon
Haggard yesterday and told him that he
must produce three of the negroes by
Saturday. The rot was precipitated by
John Green (white) hugging the wife of a
negro.

TERRIFIC STORM.
Magnitude of the Disaster
Is Just Becoming
Known.
DEATH AND UTTER RUIN
Thirteen Merrymakers Carried
Away While Preparing
for a Dance.
HAVOC CAUSED BY LIGHTNING.
Damage to Farms, Ol Fields, Roads
and Bridges Will Reach Into
Millions.
PITTSBURG, Pa., July 28.â As news of
last night's storm continues to come in
from the outlying districts to-day the
magnitude of the disaster becomes more
apparent.
In addition to the loss of life reported
last night at the camp of the Eighth
Ward Hunting and Fishing Club of
Alleghaiiy eight more deaths were report-
' Ed to-day in other places.
â¢ At the boarding-house of Samuel Mc-
Kinney at Cecil, Washington County,
thirteen merrymakers were preparing for
& dance last night when they were carried
away almost without a moment's warning,
and seven of them were drowned. Before
being rescued the others were in the water
some four hours, others all night, and the
experience they went through will never
be forgotten.
The dead were found to-day strewed all
along the flood-swept valley of Miller's
Run, the nearest two miles from the scene
of the disaster and the furthest eight miles
below. The dead are:
Mrs. Samuel McKinney, aged 59.
Margaret McKinney, aged 30, unmar
ried, eldest daughter.
James McKinney, aged 8, youngest son.
F. C. Beatty, oil pumper, aged 26, un
married, of Bradford.
J. C. Hisipins, oil pumper, unmarried,
aged 50, of Oil City.
. Jennie Holmes, aged 18, unmarried.
Vincent Wilkinson, oil driller, Oil City,
aged 32, unmarried.
â  The house was two stories high, and was
raised on props just above the banks of
Millers Run, and about seven feet above
the water level of that insignificant little
creek.
While preparations for the dance were
going on it was noticed that the water was
creeping in under the front door. The
merriment was stopped, but no danger
was felt, and the party bepan to remove
the furniture to the second floor. While
they were thus engaged the house gave a
lurch and went swirling into the flood
amid the shrieks of the inmates.
Eleven of the inmates were on the second
floor. They made a rush for the stairway,
but it was too late, the room below* being
full of water. James Pierce, an oil driller,
went on the roof of the porch. He was
swept ashore and saved. Charles Redding,
a rie builder, jumped through a window
into tbe water and managed, by clutching
the bushes, to drag himself ashore.
The villagers came trooping out into the
Btorm, but could do nothing as the bouse
swept by, and it was soon lo3t to view in
the blinding rain. The roof of the house
gave way with a crash, and one by one tLe
victims were swept from the second floor
to which they were clinging as to a raft.
Samuel McKinney had endeavored to
obtain a hold upon his wife and youngast
son, but they were swept from his grasp
by the rush of the current. McKinney
himself was under watar for some time,
but eventually reached the bane in a
faint condition and waj drawn out by the
people on the shore.
Robert McKinney, a nephew, was caught
in a tree near Gladden. He remained in
tbe limbs all night and a searching party
found him there in the morning. Lizzie
Holmes was also found in a tree and was
rescued.
Suddenly and as swiftly as it rose the
creek fell. By 6 p. m. to-day ail the
bodies had been recovered and the run
was purling along, an inoffensive creek
once more.
Near the Morcanza Run Schopl Gus
Wright, a colored driver for Bradwell's
livery stable in Carnegie, lost his life in
Charliers Creek about 8 o'clock last night.
He had driven to Cannonsburg in a two
horse carriage, and was on bis way back.
In the darkness he did not discover the
bridge had been carried away, ana drove
into the swollen creek.
In Lawrenceville (Seventeenth Ward)
the damage is greater than on J lly 15,
when the storm wrecked the stone wall
surrounding the Aiieghany Cemetery.
Tlie broken wall offered no resistance to
the flood last evening, and a raging tor
rent not only devastated a large portion
of the beautiful Aiieghany Cemetery, but
flooded Butler street and streets below to
a depth of nearly five feet.
'The cellars of hundreds of houses were
flooded and the first floors of several score
were covered with water. Every street in
that part of the city was blocked with
broken trees, stones, rubbish and mud.
All over the city traffic was suspended.
In tne mill districts along the Alleghany
river twenty-five lar. c smokestacks were
toppled over by the force of the wind, in a
number of instances wrecking the build-
ings on which they fell.
Scarcely had the thoroughfares been
made passable and delayed cars began to
move when the night deluge came on.
This, in pointof downpour, was even worse
than tbe evening flood. The hieh wind
was absent, however, but the heavens
were almost cont nuously lighted with ter
rific flashes of lightning and the roar of
thunder was continuous. The storm con
tinued with slowly diminishing energy
until midnight.
Reports from tbe districts surrounding
the cities detail the destruction of build
ings, death of farm stock and much carn
age to crops and fruit. the railroads
entering the city suffered considerable
damage and delay. The Baltimore and
Ohio railway is apparently the worst suf
ferer. Trains from above Eureka on the
mam line were unable to get through from
last evening up to noon to-day. The
through trains from the West were ex
pected early in the afternoon. The delay
was caused by a landslide near Eureka.
A large culvert at Port Royal was also
washed out and had to be bridged over De
fore trains could proceed.
The river took an upward turn eariy this
morning. At 2 o'clock this afternoon sev
enteen feet was recorded. In tbe debris
which rushed past were seen small houses,
outbuildings, fences, grainstacksand other
evidence of the severity of the storm at
points above.
Specials from surrounding towns report
loss and damage from last night's storm
as follows:
At Claysville honses were unroofed and
many buildings totally wrecked. The
United Presbyterian Church and high
school buildings were struck by lightning
and demolished. Crop 3 suffered greatly.
Ent're orchards were leveled and de
stroyed. No lives were reported lost.
At Washington, Pa., the damage in the
oil fields will be enormou.". A great
number of bridges were swept away and
roads rendered impassable.
At Canonsburg, Connellsville, West
Newton and several other points the loss
is reported heavy.
John Fiegus and George Miller, with
several companions, were camped on the
banks of the Aiieghany River near Aspin
wall. Their tents were sheltered beneath
a large sycamore tree. lather lightning
or wind tore a huge limb from the tree
and it dropped directly upon the tent in
which the members of the club had sought
shelter.
Fiegus' skull was crushed. Miller was
pinned to the ground and his back
broken. Five other members of the party
were held to the ground under the heavy
limb and severly injured.
John Aufholder met death while striv
ing to reach a place of shelter in Second
avenue.
Throughout Pittsburg and Aiieghany
buildings were unroofed, hundreds of trees
uprooted, electric wires prostrated, win
dows shattered, outbuildings and even
dwellings upset and ruined.
At McDonald, Pa., last night the rain
fall was unprecedented. The streets were
swept clear, and the board walks, which
lodged against the bridge spanning an or
dinarily small creek just below tbe town,
backed up the water until the lower por
tion of the city was for a time inundated.
No lives were lost, but the damage to
property was heavy. Several coal mines
were flooded.
Near Cecil, three miles southeast, six
bodies have been removed from the mass
of debris in Cecil Valley. Oil wells and
Ehanties occupied by oil-producers, and
workmen are thickly located along the
banks of Cecil Creek. Torrents swept
through them and gare no time foi es
cape.
The report of the drowning of sixteen
men dv a cloudburst last night in the vi
cinity of the Beadliue mine is confirmed.
The men were coal-miners and occupied
one house.
Pittsburg and Aiieghany estimates of
the total damage run anywhere from $500,
--000 to $1,000,000. In Aiieghany County the
damage to three churches will reach $65,000
or more.
INDIANA ALSO VISITED.
Frightful Wind, Rain and Electrical
Storm, With Dire Results.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., July 28. â A
heavy wind and rain storm passed over
Indiana this evening and reports to-night
indicate the damage is general. The wind
almost destroyed the Eastern routes of
the telegraph companies. Neither com
pany has a wire to Knightstown or Rich
mond. Meager dispatches from Central
and Northern Indiana show that the
storms have been phenomenal. Clinton
County's gravel roads are washed out in
innumerable places. Tipton reports a tre
mendous fall of rain and frightfui elec
trical display, during which several resi
dences were struck and a new schoolhouse
destroyed. The opera-house at Petersburg
was partially destroyed by lightning, and
Mrs. Al Goddard and child were fright
fully burned by their residence beine
struck by lightning. The great hay crop
is utterly ruined and the loss to farmers
will De immense.
APPALLING DEVASTATION.
Cloudbursts Swell the Streams and People
*rm Killed by Lightning.
ANDERSON, I^p., July 28.â The situa
tion of the Indiana gas belt is serious.
The successive cloudbursts which have
kept up with frightful regularity since
midnight .have swollen streams out of
their banks and are flooding cities and
towns. Three deaths have been the re
sult in this city. Frank Galloway, one of
these, was literally torn to pieces by
lightning. The other victims are Andrew
Haworth of Liberty and Benton Reave of
Fan-field.
The dams along White and other rivers
cave way under the heavy bodies of water
this afternoon and swept everything be
fore them. .People were rescued from
second-story windows.
The dike at Yorktown broke this after
noon, letting the lake out. It came rush
ing down White River at a terrific speed,
taking everything in its path.
Johnstown a suburb of Anderson,
named so because so many workers from
Johnstown, Pa., live there, was almost
washed away by the great dam giving
away. The river is still rising at the rate
of a foot an nour. Crops are washed out.
Dispatches to-nigbt state the cities of
Frank ton, El wood and Alexandria are
partly under water. The damages cannot
yet be estimated.
Four Towns Submerged.
NOBLES VILLE, lim, July 28.â Canoes
were the only means of transportation in
the towns of Kirklin, Elkin, Atlanta and
Arcadia this evening, the water being two
feet deep on all streets.
Small Cyclone at Danville.
DANVILLE, lirv, July 28.â During a
small cyclone this .norning several houses
were blown down. Tbe home of Henry
Thomas was struck by lightning and him
self and wife seriously injured.
Viewed a Midnight Sun.
NEW YORK, N. V., July 28.â Emil
Boas, general manager of the Hamburg-
American line, received cable advices to
day to the effect that the steamship Co
lumbia, with a party of American tourists
aboard, was favored by good weather od
her trip to the North Cape and Spitzen
bergen. The passengers witnessed the un
usual spectacle of seeing the midnight aun
four times on four nights in succession in
a perfectly cloudless skyâ the last time the
sun shining upon the glaciers and ice
mountains at Spitzenbergen.
Xew For/.'* striking Tailors.
NEW YORK, N. V., July 28.-Becretary
Solomon of the Brotherhood of Tailors
said this afternoon that about 130 outside
contractors had called at headquarters to
day and expressed a willingness to sign a
new agreement, but as the strikers de
cided to settle with the contractors as a
body in order to compel the outside con
tractors to join the Contractors' Associ
ation, no agreements were signed. Circu
lars were issued by the United Garment
workers of America No. 8 this after
noon, calling upon the members of that
organization to strike to-morrow.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JULY 29, 1896.
FIERY ANARCHY
WILL NOT DOWN,
Another Wild Scene at
the Socialist Labor
Congress.
RED FLAGS BARRED OUT.
Doorkeepers Overpowered and a
Mad Rush Made for the
Galleries.
A BABEL OF REMONSTRANCES.
"Put 'Em Out !" Is Howled in Many
Tongues and Business Is Out
of the Question.
LONDON, Eng., July 28.â The Interna
tional Socialist Trade Congress met in St.
Martin's Town Hall to-day. In view of
the disorder which characterized yester
day's meetine there was a large crowd of
outsiders present, who apparently were
anxious to see a repetition of the trouble.
As the delegates presented themselves
for admission a close scrutiny was made of
their credentials, it being feared that some
of the anarchists would endeavor to get on
the floor and create trouble. Some of
those who bore credentials which were not
in exactly the right shape were refused
permission to enter the hal 1 .
Herr Singer, the well-known socialist
member of the German Reichstag, who
speaks English fluently, acted as chair
man at to-day's session. He referred to
yesterday's disturbance and announced
that order would have to be maintained.
After the usual preliminaries the con
gress took up the question of the admis
sion of anarchists and against which a
large majority vote was cast yesterday.
Speeches for and against their recognition
as delegates were made by Jean Jurea, a
Radical Socialist member of the French
Chamber of Deputies; Tom Mann, who
was formerly a member of the House of
| Commons, and several other properly ac
credited delegates.
The speakers were much excited and
those in favor of the admission of the an
archists hotly contended that if they were
not admitted the congress would not be
internationally representative in its scope
and that its decisions and conclusions
would not carry the weight which they
would otherwise have.
The opponents of the proposition de
clared with equal decision that the admis
sion of the anarchists would have tbe ef
fect of leading the general public to be
lieve that the socialists favored the an
archists' propaganda, which the speakers
contended was not the case.
Eventually another vote was taken and
it was decided, 203 to 104, to refuse to
recognize them.
The anarchist would-be delegates were
I outside the hall waiting for a decision,
I and when it was announced to them they
| became highly indignant. It was finally
â  decided to force an entrance into the hall
and the decision was no sooner arrived at
than it was carried out. A rush was made
for the doorkeepers, who were speedily
upset and tbe crowd of anarchists made
their way to the gallery. Then began a
perfect babel. The delegates shouted in
their native tongues â Polish, French,
German, Italian, Spanish and English â
that the intruders should be put out.
Finally, when the voice of a speaker
could be heard above the din, Tom Mann
and Kier Hardie addressed the chair, ad
vocating the admission of one of the an
archists. Other speakers opposed the
proposition, and the executive committee
awaitt d until it appeared there was a de
cidedly favorable chance of yesterday's
disgraceful scene being repeated.
Herr Singer finally succeeded in obtain
ing a little order, and it was then agreed
that properly accredited anarchists should
be admitted, but should be allowed to take
no part in the debate. Later another vote
was taken and it was decided to uphold
tbe resolution, which in effect provides
that anarchists shall not be admitted.
There the question remains at present.
HEARST'S NEW VENTURE
The Editor Said to Be Arrang
ing to Start a Paper in
Chicago.
It Will Be Democratic in Politics and
Support Bryan and
SÂ»wall.
CHICAGO, 111., July 28.â A morning
paper says: The Democratic party, if
present plans do not miscarry, will have a
paper voicing Democratic opinions in
Chicago within a month. The new sheet
will be called the Chicago Daily Enquirer,
but further than that the promoters re
fuse to divulge their plans. The capital
stock of the Enquirer will be $1,000,000, all
of which is in sight, though as yet none
has been subscribed.
Though there has been talk of starting a
free-silver paper in this city for a year, the
.present movement was not begun until
after Bryan's nomination. When the
local Democratic paper bolted the plat
form the Democrats decided to issue the
Enquirer. On Saturday, when they learned
that John R. McLean intended starting a
paper similarly named, they called on P.
J. Deviin and asked him to design a head
and have it copyrighted.
Devlin said last night the paper would
soon be issued, but refused to say who the
editors would be. The men back of the
Enqu'rer, Devlin says, have not been a part
of any previous effort to start a free silver
sheet here. Some were Chicago men and
some were from other cities, east and west.
"I am not in any way connected with the
paper," Devlin said, "nor will I be when
it starts. I know who the promoters are,
but am cot Bt liberty to disclose their
names. McLean is not in any way con
nected with the paper, nor is Bryan."
Other men in a position to know of the
scheme say the prime mover ij Editor
Hearst of the New York Journal and San
Francisco Examiner. The paper will
champion the cause of the Democratic
nominees, Bryan and Sewall, and they
say its advocacy of free silver wili be of
the rampant kind. In appearance it will i
be extremely plain, but its backers pro
pose to make it compare favorably with
its Chicaeo contemporaries. The date of
tne first issue will do about August 10.

MUTINY OF CONVICTS,
Exciting Scenes at the Fort
Leavenworth Government
Penitentiary.
Several Prisoners Shot by the Guards
and the Others Forced to
Submission.
LEAVENWORTH, Kans., July 28.- A
mutiny broke out among the convicts at
the United States penitentiary at Fort
Leavenwortb, and a wild time followed.
The trouble started with a gang of thirty
men under six guards who were at work
on the prison farm.
Georee Yeast, an Indian Territory des
perado, six feet six inches tall, was the
leader, and at a given signal the men
broke. The guards began shooting at
once with guns loaded with buckshot, and
most of the prisoners gave up and fell flat
upon the ground to avoid being ahot.
Yeast and two other prisoners were se
riously wounded. Yeast will die.
The shooting caused a general alarm,
and soon guards, soldiers and ambulances
came rushing from the fort garrison. The
men shot were loaded on ambulances and
taken to the prison.

of the heliograph station, succeeded in
flashing signals to the San Bernardino sta

a rainstorm intervening between the two
station-, and which completely obscured
them from each other, though both were

GAUDAUR WINS BY
EIGHT LENGTHS
Easily Takes the Single
Scull Contest at
Halifax.
DURNAN COMES SECOND.
Exciting Finish B2tween Three
Men for the Minor
Purse.
ROGERS WAITS TOO LONG.
Passes Hanlan, but Is Unable to
Catch the Other Toron
tan's Shell.
HALIFAX, N. 8., July 28.â The weather
was grand this afternoon for the openine
events of the carnival regatta. There was,
however, a pretty stiff wind, making the
water somewhat rough at the beginning,
but it moderated almost to a calm before
the last race.
The single scull contest, the big event,
was concluded about 7:30 o'clock. There
were seven starters â Gaudaur, Hanlan,
Bubear, Durnan, Rogers, Casey and Levitt.
The prizes were $500, $150 and $100. It was
an easy victory for the favorite. Jake Gau
daur, who finished ahead apparently
without the least discomfort by more
than eight lengths. At the turn Bubear
aud Casey were out of the race.
The contest so far as Durnan, Hanlan
and Rogers were concerned began as soon
as they squared away for the finish line.
Hanlan and Durnan were alongside each
other for fully a mile, straining every
nerve to gain an advantage over each
other. Durnan proved the best stayer,
and when a half mile from the line grad
ually drew away from his uncle. Rogers,
throughout the struggle between tbe To
rontans, kept well up to them and now
began to row rapidly and gain on them.
He had, however, saved, himself too long
and, although he passed Hanlan, could
not reach Durnan.
At the finish Durnan's bow was about
five feet ahead of Rogers' boat and the
latter's bow only four feet ahead of Han
lan's.
Gaudaur's time was 20:25, which consid
ering that the water was a little lumpy
when the race began and tbe full course
was a three-mile one was almost up to ex
pectations. Three of the men entered for
the event â Hackett, Haines and Barr â
did not start.

ANGLO-CELTIC CICLE FEUD.
Wheelmen Allow >ni ionahtu Prejudice
to Spoil Their Sport.
CHICAGO, 111. July 28.â A private let
ter from Dublin gives some interesting
details of the feud that is raging between
the cyclists of England and Ireland. The
trouble started with the adoption of a
resolution by the board of control of the
National Cyclists' Union of Great Britain
declaring tLat after June 15 no entries
from Irish riders should be accepted for
English championship races. Preyious to
this there had been an agreement between
the two principal amateur cycling organi
zations of England and Ireland, by which
members of each were entitled to compete
in races on either side of the Irish Chan
nel. Upon the issuance of the new order
an extraordinary general meeting was beld
of the council of the Irish Cyclists' Asso
ciation, and a resolution adopted barring
riders holding certificates oi the English
body from competing at Irish champion
ship sports.

lengths.
The engineer had been warned to run
his engine at its best, but he could not
defeat the bicycle. The Empire State
express, which arrived in Syracuse at 3:50,
fairly defeated the sextuplet for half a
mile, though the wheel was only left
behind several lengths.

KILAUEA SPOUTS
FIRE AND LAVA.
The Great Hawaiian Vol
cano Is Again in
Eruption.
aUIET FOR TWO YEARS.
Visitors Flocking to Points of
Vantage to View the
Outbreak.
ACTIVITY DAILY INCBEASING.
Anxiety Felt at Hilo and Other Points
About Severe Earthquake
Shocks.
HONOLULU, Hawaii, July 21. â Kiliauea,
the great Hawaiian volcano, after a state
o' quiescence lasting over a year and. a half,
and broken by but two short intervals of
spasmodic effort, haa again enterod upon
a period of violent activity. At the bot
tom of Halemauman, the central pit and
fire hole of the nine-mile crater, a lake of
liquid fire has already formed, streams of
molten lava are pouring into it from all
sides and two new minor craters have de
veloped upon the floor of the immense
pit, which, taken collectively, is knowa
as Kilauea, the largest active volcano In
the world.
The outbreak occurred at a few mo
ments after 7 o'clock on the evening of
the 11th inst., and from all reports so far
received from the Kamaainas (old set
tlers) of the big island there is every in
dication of permanency and a great en
largement of the area over which the
fiery streams will run and crimson foun
tains play. Inter-island steamers from
the Hawaiian metropolis are crowded with
local visitors, who are flocking to see the
latest phases of nature's most spectacular
phenomenon.
It is over two months now since
Mokuaweoweo, the summit crater of
Mauna Loa, suddenly and without warn
ing burst into splendor and shot a column
of blinding light into the sky â a rose*
colored shaft hundreds of feet in diameterâ
whicn startled the inhabitants of all Hawaii
and was plainly visible from the higher
altitudes about Honolulu. Considerable
anxiety was felt at Hilo and other points
on the island of Hawaii, as it has fre
quently happened in the past that an
outburst at the summit was followed by
earthquake and lava flows down the moun
tain side, either one likely to be most dis
astrous in effect. However, the period of
duration was but a few days, and the fires
disappeared almost as quickly as they
came. Now they have blazed up again in
the old stamping ground of Pele. the
fire goddess, and in all probability have
come to stay.
Latest returns report a constantly in
creasing activity in the crater, two new
lakes at points not far distant from
Halemr.umau, where tbe seat of the great
est turbulence has generally been for gen
erations past, and, what wili prove of
prime interest to prospective visitors, a
chance to seethe whole show without leav
ing the comfortable vehicles which con
vey one to the hotel from the sea.
A good carriage road extends part of the
way round the rim of the main crater,
while the situation of the new fire lakes is
such that the play of the fountains,
streams of lava and other features are
plainly visible from the top of the walls.

VICTORIA SEALING
CLAIMS DECIDED,
Schooner Beatrice Awarded
Damages for Illegal
Seizure.
RESULT OF A TEST CASE
Great Britain Will Insist That
This Country Pay the
Judgments.
AMERICAN PATROL AT FAULT
Vessels Placed Under Arrest in Bsr
ing Sea Without Evidence
to Convict.
VICTORIA. B. C, July 28.â A case of
the greatest importance to sealing men â
an action for prospective damages in the
suit of the Crown vs. the schooner Bea
trice â has been decided in the Exchequer j
Court of Canada by "Chief Justice Davie, !
sitting as local Judge in admiralty. The j
Beatrice, of which Charles Doering was
owner and master, was seized by the
American cutter Richard Rush on the 20th
of August last, just as it had commenced
vrork among the seals in Bering Sea. It
was sent back to Victoria under arrest, j
and here was tried on a formal motion to
confiscate the vessel and contents to the
crown. In this action the preponderance
of evidence was with the vessel, the court
deciding that the seizure was wholly un- |
justifiable, and restoring the schooner,
stores and 203 skins aboard to the custody
of Captain Doerinc. the skins subsequently
boinp sold at $10 25 each.
The skipper of the Beatrice brought a
claim aeainst the British Government for
the value of the catch tnat might reason
ably have been secured had the schooner
been allowed to complete its season's hunt
mp. Several other vessels, notably the
K. B. Marvin, which were similarly situ
ated with regard to presumptive loss inci
dent to their seizure, determined to let the
Beatrice's appeal stand as a test case and
the hearing of the claim was accordingly
brought on as quickly as possible. The
Judge decided at the outset that the jus
tice of the claim could not be disputed,
and the evidence taken was almost en
tirely as to the extent and value of the
catch that the schooner might reasonably
have been expected to make had it com
pleted the season's hunting.
Alter comparing and averaging the
catches of all the schooners of the fleet
similarly outfitcd it was decided to allow
the Beatrice the value of 518 additional
skins at tbe price realized for those given
back to Captain Doering with his vessel.
From this total the court deducted the
value of the stores saved by the schooner's
early return, and an order was made for a
judgment against the crown for a net bal
anceâ $3163 50.
The Marvin and several other vessels
will now go through the pleasing formal
ity of proving their consequential damage
claims, while Great Britain will insist that
the United States, by whose vessels the ir
regular seizures were made, must ul
timately loot the bills.
NOT PUDDIN'HEAD'S TEST
Painter Graham Acquitted of
the Charge of Malicious
Mischief.
Was Accused of Defacing Doors of
Dwellings to Cause His Em-
ployers Trouble.
' SACRAMENTO, Cal., July 28.â One of
the hardest fought legal battles in years in
this city was concluded in the City Justice
Court to-day, resulting in the vindication j
of the defendant. Thomas Graham, a '
painter by profession, was arrested, and
charged with malicious mischief in having 1
defaced the doors of two buildings which j
were undergoing painting at the hands of j
Sullivan, Kelly & Co's men. At the trial!
it was proved that a number of the em- i
ployed men had been having trouble with |
the firm's foreman, and through revenge
were supposed to have committed this
depredation. A seemingly complete chain
of circumstantial evidence connected Gra
ham with the outrage, but his counsel
proved an alibi, reinforced by the testi
mony of many merchants of the city.
Graham had been a member of a commit
tee from the Painters' Union, which had
spent the day on which the outrage was
committed in soliciting donations for me
parade of the union on the Fourth of July.
The trial was replete with surprises
from start to finish, but probably the
greatest of these was when Senator Sprague
and A. M. Seymour, counsel for the
defense, stated this afternoon that they
intended to introduce in evidence certain
thumb marks which had been left by the
guilty persons in black paint upon the
defaced doors. Senator Sprague stated
that these marks were clear and distinct,
showing all the delicate lines of the flesh,
and he proposed to place them under a
powerlul magnifying class, in conjunction
with the thumb of the defendant, and
prove his entire innocence. Unhappily
for the success of the mooted experiment
some vandal bad in the meantime de
stroyed the evidence and the practicability
of tiie bdieme, which would have so de
lighted Puddin'head Wilson, failed of de
monstration.
TALKING AGAINST TAXATION.
Manager Clayton of the San Mateo Electric
Railway Appears Before ' the
Equalizers.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., July 28.âMan
ager Clayton of the San Mateo Electric
Railway appeared before the State Board
of Equalization to-day and related a story
of the demoralization of values that was
startling in the extreme. The rolling
stock of his line, consisting of twenty-nine
cars, was so dilapidated that it was only
saved from sharing the fate of the mys
tical one-horse-shay by the firmness with
which it had been bolted together when it
left the manufacturers' hands. The rails
were not fitted for the labors required of
them; in fact, nearly the entire road
would have to be replaced within a year.
The road originally cost $1,030,000, but
could easily be replaced for $500,000.
During the past year it had been disposed
of at forced sale, bringing only $300,000,
though to be sure it was purchased by two
of the largest bondholders of the com
pany.
The valuation placed upon the road in
1895 by the bonrd was $150,000, and al
though Mr. Clayton admitted that at a
forced sale the road had brought twice
that amount, his petitition tiled with the
board estimated the proper valuation to
be $67,258. This petition inclosed a table
setting forth that the Market and Sutter
street railways were only assessed for 25
per cent of their real value, the California
street railway for 29 per cent and tbe
Geary-street for 35 per cent. He claimed
that his company's property was up ia
the 70's, and as it paid a gross percentage
of 2 per cent for license, and t as supposed
at irregular periods to perf j certain so
called improvements oti ne streets, he
considered that it waÂ« . bused cor
poration.
Then President Morehouse introduced
Manager Clayton into the maze of general
taxation, and the board adjourned, with a
smile of satislaction on the face of tbe
president.

deavorers of the Christian Church en
campment at Garneid Park held a sunrise
prayer-meeting at Endeavor Rock, on the

tiful one at all times, but with the early
suu, rising above the Santa Cruz range of
mountains, shedding warmth and bright
ness upon the city beyond and gilding the
white-capped breakers that beat against
the cliffs, that beauty is enhanced many
fold and tbe roar of the ocean is a wonder
ful contrast to the quiet of the near-by
fields, undisturbed save by the music of
birds. The Endeavorers have for several
years had their regular sunrise prayer
meeting on this rock, and this morning
the meeting under the leadership of Rev.
L. A. Pier was an earnest of the faith of
those who look for permanent results to
come out of this particular devotion.
The Endeavor convention was called to
order at the tabernacle in the park at 9
o'clock. Papers were read by Charles
Lewis of Santa Cruz on "Consecration";
by Jessie Brown of Woodland on "The
General Unrest of the Times," and by Rev.

WAS DUNHAM THE THIEF?
Recovery of a JHfle Believed to Have Seen.
Stolen by the Murderer.
BANTA CRUZ, Cal., July 28.â A light
rifle stolen from a cabin on the ranch of
Supervisor Lay at Glenwood two months
ago was recovered in this city to-day by
Officer Corey. At the time of the theft,
Dunham, the Campbells murderer, was
believed to have crossed tbe mountains
near Glenwood and gone on down the
coast, and the belief was that he had stolen
tbe weapons. Local officers began a quie
search for the missing arms. No trace of
tbe shotgun was found, but tbe rifle has
been identified by its owner, L. L. Merrill,
whose initials were cut in the stock be
neath and covered by tbe harp of the trig
ger. B. Laird had bold the rifle to a shoot
ing gallery.
When questioned to-day, LairH. said he
purchased it of a tall man who, he realized
afterward, would answer Dunham's de
scription accurately, though the fact did
not appear to him at the time. He paid
only $2 for tbe rifle, and he was more in
tent upon the bargain than upon the
stranger's identity.
Merrill is satisfied the weapons were
stolen by Dunham, and the officers are of
like opinion.

SEATTLE CONVICT
ESCAPES DEATH.
Innocent of a Crime for
Which He Was Doomed
to Be Hanged.
HENRY CRAEMER'S LUCE
Trace of a Missing Witness
Found After a Long
Search.
CAS ESTABLISH AN ALIBI.
S:ntcnced to the Gallows for Murder,
bat Saved by a Faithful
Friend.
SEATTLE, Wabh., July 28.â After
nearly two years' diligent search on the
part of bis frien d O. F. Wegener, Henry
Craemer, who was convicted and sen
tenced to be hanged for the murder of
Mrs. Phillipine Mueller and ber babe on
the evening of Aueust 13, 1894, is about to
be saved from the gallows.
From the day of his arrest Craemer has
protested his innocence, stoutly main
taining that upon the day and hour of the
commission of the crime he was in
Tacoma, in company with a man named
"Jack" Quincy. The authorities from the
outset declared Quincy to be a myth, bat
Wegener has established beyond any
question the identity of the man, and by
the hotel registers disclosed that "Jack"
Quincy stopped on August 16, 1834. and
once in 1895, at s# hotel in Victoria, B. C.
Wegener is still prosecuting bis search for
Quincy, who is a prospector by occupa
tion, and he feels more than confident
that he will find the man in the mining
district of British Columbia.
Germans throughout tbe country, and
especially tboee in Philadelphia and San
Francisco, contributed money toward the
search for evidence of Craemer's inno
cence, which Wegener has been prosecu
ting. The latter hss some very sensa
tional affidavits, which he refuses to give
out now, concerning both officers and
witnesses for the prosecution.
SANTA CLARA'S DANGER,
Spread of Tuberculosis Among
Cattle Herds in the
County.
Inspector Spencer Authorized to Check
the Disease by Enforcing
the Law.
SAN JOSE, Cal.. July 28.â The meeting
at the Board of Supervisors' room to-day
for the purpose of taking steps to prevent
the sale of diseased nii!k and looking to
the inspection and extermination of
tuberculous cattle was largely attended.
Los Gatos, Santa Clara and Gilroy were
represented by municipal officers. The
Board of Health, tbe Common Council,
the Supervisors and representatives of the
medical fraternity were present, as were
also a large number of dairymen and
cattle-owners of the county. Chairman
Greeninger of the Supervisors presided.
Veterinary Inspector Bpencer said since
March 20 he had examined 892 head
of cattle. Of this number 225 had been
found to be diseased. During July 331
cattle had been examined. The state of
affairs was found to be appalling. The
dairymen have ordinarily submitted
gracefully to inspection, and until lately
had requested the slaughter of diseased
cattle. Over eighty bead of cattle had
been slaughtered. Those who refused to
kill their cattle threatened te drive them
to other counties.
Dr. Simon ton, president of the Santa
Clara Conntv Medical Society, said that
from July, 1894, to July, 1895, there were
11,349 deaths in the State, of which tuber
culosis stood at the head with 1789, pneu
monia 889 and stomach troubles 738. The
disease has in recent years been dis
covered to be not inheritable, but a com
municable disease, and he asked:
"What right has anybody to deal out
and sell poison to his neighbors, to chil
dren?"
The effect was appalling, said the doc-
I tor, and he cited that there was plenty of
j law to prevent the sale of this poison in
meat or in milk, and all that was needed
was backbone in the authorities to enforce
the laws.
The question of inspecting the herds and
killing the diseased cattle was discussed at
great length by tbe representatives of the
several cities and towns present, a great
niany.dairymen and cattle-owners joining.
A resolution was finally adopted in
structing Veterinary Inspector Spencer to
inspect the herds of the county and to kill
the condemned animals, but before in
specting to get a signed agreement from the
owner of the same to submit to tbe killing
of the diseased cattle. Tbe inspector was
also instructed to report each month the
owners of dairies who refused to submit to
inspection, and their names will be pub
lished.

movement for better city government re
ported to the general committee in the
rooms of tbe Merchants' and Manufac

Tne reDort, which was read by Fred L.
Alles, secretary of the orpanizauon,
treated of the needs of this city in the
way of municipal reform, and many of the
reasons why abuses and extravagances
now exist.
Tbe plan outlined is a comprehensive
one and seeks first of all to amend the
city charter, so that ofjice-holders shall be
directly responsible to the people for their
acts, as well as the abolition of the offen
sive patronage system.
Allied organizations are to be formed in
wards and precincts, and the festive but
persistent political boss Is to be relegated
to private life. The name adopted is tbe
League for Better City Government. Men
are to be chosen for office because of their
known honor, integrity and capacity,
while the general patronage is to be based
on efficiency, and all men shall take office
absolutely untrammeled.
A general meeting of the masses will
soon be called, and the movement pushed
in all quarters of the city. The next mu
nicipal election occurs early in December,
when it is proposed to wipe out political
rings, retire the "push" and put the city
on au honest, efficient and economical
basis.

hear anarchism and "blood to the bridles"
preached, but they were agreeably sur
prised to hear only suggestions for the
gocd of mankind. He declared that un
der.socialistic rule two hours of labor each
day would produce all of the luxuries and
necessities required by man, thus giving
more time for the development of human
genius.
From the interest taken in the move
ment it is apparent tnat there are many

lieving with him that socialism is "thf
religion of all hearts and the heart of all
religions," will aid in spreading the doc
trine.

Young Men.
The chances of total loss of manly power
are so great in men who 'find Blight indi-
cations of a waste in the system.that it is
vitally important that such indications be
attended to at ance. They should be
checked while such a thing is possible, for
if they are permitted to continue, instead
of stopping naturally, they will oecome
greater from day to day. and will, in a few
years, completely disrupt the whole nerv-
ous and vital .oraariism. . ; : â <â  â  ;
v Young men who notice what they con-
sider light symptoms of weakness do not
realize the danger that lurks in their path.
They do not understand the serious conse-
quences, the destruction of nerve tissue,
waste of vital force and power of brain,
loss of flesh, loss of memory and total
im potency. These are ' the consequences
that follow in the trail of slight evidences
of weakness.
CURE IT NOW.
To protect your future manhood, to
guard against total loss of vitality, regain
your health now. While youth is at hand
to bring happiness and joy, such as comes
to the strong/drive away the cause of de-
pression, bring back confidence, bright
eyes and happy disposition. Bring them
back naturally by removing the weakness.

ADDRESS TO WHEELMEN
Chief Crowley Blamed for the
Disturbances the Night of
the Parade
VERY FEW MEMBEBS DISSEKT
Reports of All Committees Accepted
and Arrangements Made for
a Banquet
The executive committee of the Cycle
Board of Trade and Southside Improve
ment Clubs met at the Indiana Bicycle
Company's establishment, 18 McAllister
street, last night, to listen to the reports
of committees and wind up the business of
the parade. The "business of the parade"
proved to be pretty wide in its scope be
iore the meeting adjourned, and ended in
a drastic condemnation of the police and
the Market-street Railroad Company.
The report of the committee on prizes
was accepted, and a vote of thanks was
extended it for the efficiency with whicn it
had performed its duty.
A vote of thanks was also extended
those who had been enthusiastic enough
to help out the parade by decorating along
tbe line of march, and to tbe Street De
partment for the excellent manner in
which it had prepared the streets for
the occasion.
Dr. Rottanzi, president of the Southside
Improvement Clubs, made a short speech
eulogizinÂ»JSergeant Price for the thorough
manner in which he had preserved order
at the speakers' stand on Van Ness avenue.
The following address to the bicycle
clubs of this City was issued by the com
mittee:
To the Bicycle Clubs of San Francisco: The San
Francisco Cycle Boara of Trade and Southside
Improvement Clubs in regular session extends
to you their thanks and congratulations for
your hearty participation in the parade of July
'25. In point oi numbers the procession ex
ceeded any similar demonstration ever held
west of Chicago. In regard to original and ar
tistic decoration of wheels and tandems your
efforts have never been equaled nor exceled.
We regret that better police protection was
not possible in our City and we deplore the
i and unreasonable conduct of the Mar
ket-syeet Railroad company.
We can assure you, however, that the objects
of our demonstration have been fully accom
plished and that we have aroused the sympa
thy and secured the support of the well
wishers of San Francisco in regard to the beu
terment of our streets ana pavements.

c J. 8. Conwell, President.
James m. Hamilton, Secretary.
SorTHsiDE Improvement Ci,cbsâ
T. A. Rottanzi, M. D., President.
I. Schwartz. Secretary.
A reahot discussion was precipitated by
J. J. McEwen, who introduced a resolu
tion severely censuring the Market-street
Railway Company for the manner in
which cars bad been run through the
crowd, the result of which was to break
the parade up into sections and destroy
che effect coming from unity, and the in
difference of the police.
A. B. Magi'ire was opposed to any such
resolution being adopted on the grounds
that the police had done all in th*ir power
to keep the unruly element in order, and
that the railway company would retaliate
by making things as uncomfortable for
cyclists in future as possible.
To this argument Henry F. Wynne re
torted that if they permitted themselves
to be overridden without a murmur at this
time they would always be so treated, that
the railroad company had acted shame
fully in the matter and should be criti
cized as they deserved, and that as regards
the police they were perfectly able to be
out in force around the Pavilion and keep
immense crowds orderly when some
"plng-uglies" were engaged in battering
each other, and it was very peculiar they
could not so in this case.
W. J. Kenney thought the palice had
done all they could to assist in making the
parade a success. He said he had had a
conference with Chief Crowley, in which
the* latter had explained to him the diffi
culties arising in handling a mixed crowd,
and as for nimself he was perfectly satis
tied.
Wavering sentiment was fixed by the
stand taken by Chairman J. 8. Conwell,
who believed with Wynne that the Chief
could spare men enough to preserve order
at a pr.ze- fight and was dissembling when
he intimated that he could not do so in the
case of a cyclists' parade.
Upon putting the resolution to a vote
it was adopted aimost unanimously. The
following is the text of tbe resolution:
Whereas, The cyclists' good streets demon
stration, under the joint auspices of the San
irancisco Cycle Board of Trade and Southside
Improvement Clubs, held on Saturday, July
'2b, was interfered with by roughs, hoodlums
and other disreputable characters, and al.-o
especially by the electric und cable cars of tbe
Market-street Railroad Company on Folsom,
Market and Kearny streets, even to the ex
tent of some of the cars running into and
overturning some ot the bicyclists, therefore
bu it
Resolved, That we, the executive committee
of toe above demonstration, denounce tbe in
efficiency and neglect of the Police Depart
ment in no; furnishing sufficient proteotion;
apd also especially condemn and denounce
the Market-street Railroad Company for their
outrageous, high-handed actions in operating
and insolently intruding their cars, thus
breaking into the parade and materially inter
fering with its success.
After the adoption of the resolution, the
bills were audited, and the general finan
cial matters of the occasion settled up.
o A committee of two. in the persons of
A. B. Maguire and Henry F. Wynne, was
appointed to arrange for a banquet in
which the members of the executive com
nnttee and a few invited guests should
participate.
Resolutions of thanks were adopted for
the press, tlie press committee, I. Schwartz,
P. m HeÃwen, and Dr. T. A. Rottanzi;
\V. J. McKenney, the chairman of the
parade committee; tbe committee who
hadÂ°charge of the speakers' ntand. Treas
urer James M. Hamilton, and Secretary
K. Wiener.
The committee then adjourned sine die.
ROAD CLUB TAKES ACTION.
Oundemm the Market-Street Railway
Company aurt the Police Department.
The San Francisco Road Club met last
' evening and passed resolutions condemn
ing the action of the Market-street Rail
way Company and the Police Department
during the good streets demonstration on
the evening of July 25th. Following are
the resolutions:
Whekeas, The executive committee of the
good streets demonstration ol July 25 did all
in its power that human ingenuity or fore
sight could do to make the cyclers*' Darade a
jr-aii'l .-uccc-ss and an occasion that would be
mvLiionble as an p;ioch in the development of
pood itreeta in our fair City; and whereas, the
urfficiency, neglect, care leas ness and incom
petence ot'tne heads of the Police Department
and Marktu-street Railway Company caubed
dissatisfaction and disappointment to the
thousands of expectant spec'ators, many of
vhom had come miles to participate, and by
their presence and encouragement give cvi- ,
dence of their sympathy and support to the
cause oi good streets; be it
Resolved, That we condemn the action of the
Police Department and Market-street Railway
Company for their gross carelessness and neg
lect; and be It further
Resolved, That we thank the South Side Im
provement clubs for their efl orts in behalf ot
good streets.
THEY'RE FOR M'KINLEY.
Another Club With 146 Charter Mem-

"FEED THE BIRDS, MAMMA."
Charles Zany's Bequest to Hli Wife Be
fore Being Locked Up.
Charles Zang appeared before Judge Low
yesteiday to explain why he had threat
ened to kill his wife Sophie, who lives at
812 Jessie street. After hearing the evi
dence the Judge felt inclined to discharge
Zang. As soon as Zang perceived this he
commenced a tirade of abuse against his
wife which had quite a different effect
from what be anticipated.
"You are a coward, sir," said the Judge
as he thumped the bench, "and I will hold
you in $500 bonds to keep the peace toward
your wife. You will be kept in custody
till you can furnish the bonds."
As Mrs. Zang, with a smile on her face,
was leaving the courtroon, Zang ran to
ward her and cried, "Feed the birds,
mamma, feed the birds. Don't let the
little darlines starve." Mrs. Zang prom
ised to feed them.
DON'T LIKE THE IDEA,
Unemployed Do Not Take

Suggestion.
Indignant at the Ruling of Chairman
Craig at Monday Night's
Meeting.
A meeting of the unemployed to protest
against the resolutions adopted Monday
night at Metropolitan Temple was held
yesterday afternoon at 1159 Mission street.
Fully 100 were present at the meeting,
which was presided over by H. C. Smith.
Paul Hartman acted as secretary.
George Specd â who offered an amend
ment to the resolution adopted at Metro
politan Temple, but was ruled out of order
by Chairman Craig â made a spirited
speech denouncing the Salvation Army,
and moved that a manifesto be issued
"setting forth the present conditions of
labor and the futility of any such patch
ing-up process as that offered by the Sal
vation Army."
In support of bis amendment Mr. Speed
declared that the Salvation Army was or
ganized to aggrandize upon the misery of
the poor. "They boast," he aaid, "that
from their London industrial farm they
made $104,000. All this doubtless went
into the coffers of the army, and the poor
men who earned it are none the better off.
"They cannot do ns any good. The only
thing. ior the unemployed to do is to stand
together and parade themselves openly
and frankly and compel the people to
recognize their condition, if the Salva
tionists really had your interests at heart
why were not some of your representatives
asked to be on the platform last night?
Why were yon not consulted? Do they
think that they are more competent to
know what you want than you yourselves
are? They are not working forour inter
ests. The only thing for us to do is to band
together and become fully class-conscious."
The resolution was unanimously car
ried and a committee of three, consisting
of Messrs. Speed, Grimes and Oliver, was
appointed to draw up the manifesto.
Upon the motion of Dr. Willey a com
mittee consisting of Messrs. Lewis, Edlin,
Volney Brown and Smith was appointed
to devise some practical plan to aid the
unemployed. The committee will report
at the meeting to be held at 2 o'clock this
afternoon.
Dr. Spuraeon of the Jesus Christ Army
spoke briefly in denunciation of the Salva
tion Army, which, he declared, had en
tered a number of fields of industry and
had driven workers out. Chairman Smith
also made a few remarks, in tne course of
which he declared that there would be no
hope of permanent improvement for the
unemployed until the overthrow of the
competitive system. The meeting then
adjourned to meet at 2 o'clock this after
noon.
The City Central Committee of the
Socialist- Labor party of this City at their
meeting to-night, after transacting the
regular business, took up the matter of the
unemployed's protest at the meeting of
the Salvation Army in Metropolitan
Temple Monday night.
After discussion a motion was carried to
the effect that the action of the unem
ployed in protesting against the Salvation
Army, or any other reiigious body en
deavoring to canvass the City in the name
of the unemployed for food, money or
land for the purpose of establishing a poor
farm, be indorsed, and the sympathy of
the body be extended to them in their
battle against hypocrisy and injustice.
It was also decided that the present
central committee's term of office expires
on Tuesday night, August 4, when the
new delegates elected from the different
Assembly districts will be installed and
will take up the work of the campaign and
business of the Socialist-Labor party of
this City.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JULY 29, 1896.
WARRANT ISSUED
FOR C. O. SWANBERG
Complaint Sworn To Yes
terday Before Judge
Conlan.
CHARGED WITH PERJURY
Eastern Police Have Been Noti
fied to Place Him Under
Arrest.
OTHER CHARGES WILL BE MADE
Attorney Thornton Fears, However,
That Swanberg Succeeded in
Escaping.
Chief Crowley yesterday morning Bet
the wires in motion to effect the arrest of
Charles 0. Swanberg on a charge of per
jury, and at any moment word may be re
ceived that he has been captured.
The warrant for his ar.rest was sworn to
before Judge Conlan, and the complaining
witness is Attorney Ludwig M. Hoefler of
532 Market street
In tbe complaint it is alleged that on
June 19 Swanberg perjured himself by
testifying before Jndge Coffey that he had
C. O. Swanberg.
not known Louis Corriveau, whose estate
worth $75,000 was in probate, previous to
August, 1893, whereas it is claimed that
he had known him since January, 1&92.
It was tbe intention to take the matter
before the Grand Jury on Monday, but it
was found that the jurors were so busy
they could not consider it before Friday.
Recourse waa therefore had to tfce Police
Courts so as to intercept Swanberg with
out delay.
C. H. Westphal, representing H. W.
Westphal, called upon Captain Lees yes
terday morning with the information that
Swanberg is now in Chicago, where he
would be joined by his wife and daughter,
preparatory to making his annual trip to
Sweden.
Mr. Westphal denounced the warrant of
arrest as an outrage, and offered to bring
Swanberg back to meet the charge, pro
vided his expenses going and coming were
paid.
The proposition was submitted to Crit
tendon Thornton, the attorney for the
prosecution, who promptly rejected it.
Chief Crowiey, who was called in, said he
had no funds to draw from, and the mat
ter would have to go through the usual
channels, so that the expense would be
borne by the State.
Attorney Thornton demanded that
steps should be taken to have Swanberg
arrested. Judge Conlan was sent for and
the complaint was carefully examined and
found to be all right. The Chief then
wired to Chicago and other coints East,
notifying the police that Swanberg was
wanted and to place him under arrest.
Attorney Nagle, wno represents Swan
berg, was also a visitor at police head
quarters. He claimed that even if Swan
berg had testified falsely as to the length
of his acquaintance with Corriveau the
issue was immaterial. He denounced the
proceeding as a piece of blackmail, and
said if Swanberg were arrested he would
go to Sacramento and plead with Gover
nor Budd to refuse to issue requisition
papers.
As soon as word is received of Swan
berg s arrest Detective Ross Whitnker will
be sent to Sacramento with the requisi
tion papers and to bring him back to the
City,
Attorney Crittenden Thornton, when
seen last night lieciined to say what future
course was to be pursued in reference to
Swanberg and Westphal. Said ne: "I do
not believe it would be fair to my clients
to make the matter public, and I do not
wish to facilitate the escape of these men
by outlining our course. I fear that the
premature publication of the facts of the
case in the papers has given Swanberg an
excellent chance tor escape. I will say
however, that if Swanberg be arrrested
other charges besides ihe pending charge
of perjury will be placed against him.'
This and other statements of Attorney
Thornton indicate that there is much
more in the matter than appears upon its
'a *v Monday ni ght the attorney
stated that the amount of money involved
was ?175,000. This amount of $175 000
however, Attorney Thornton declares is
in connection with quite another matter.
Papers will be filed to-day in reference
to the Swanberg matter, but just what is
the nature of these papers Attorney Thorn
ton refused to say. "We do not wish to
play our cards into our opponent's hands
by disclosing what we intend to do " he ex
plained.
Meanwhile word from the East is eagerly

A TITLE MAKES TROUBLE
Two Local Grocers' Associations
Have a Dispute About
a Picnic.
But the Picnic Will Be Held and the
Title Omitted to Some
Extent
There is an active antagonism *oing on
between two associations of City grocers.
It is over the right to use the title "Retail
Grocers' Protective Union" in con
nection with advertising a picnic to be
held at Scduetzen Park on August 9.
The story in it goes back to 187 L In
April of that year the original Retail
Grocers' Protective Union of Sari Fran-
CUM) was organized. The object of the
union is indicated by his name, and it or
ganized for tbe additional purpose of pro
tecting itself against suicidal prices and
bad debtors.
Things'ran along prosperously and har
moniously till abont a year ago. .There
was considerable money in the treasury,
and the number of members was about
450. The union gave, for instance, $1000
to the Midwinter Fair. Many of the lead
ing members thonght they could employ
the idle money in establishing a whole
sale store for the benefit of the members,
and saving a middleman's profit, which
runs from 15 to 40 per cent. But others
were opposed to it, and this is the rock on
which the Retail Grocers' Protective
Union split. But the wholesale branch
was organized and incorporated as the
Retail Grocers' Association, claiming to
have swallowed up the old name, title and
organization.
But a man who is now a member of both
associations says that after a while, and
possibly under the influence of other
wholesale grocery institutions, members
of the retail association began to drop out,
and there are now said to be only 175
members in it.
Some who dropped out and some who
had never belonged met and organized an
oÂ»her association under the original name
of t c Retail Grocers' Protective Union,
which tbe other association claimed to
have absorbed. They have held two meet
ings, and a member says their member
ship roll numbers â¢eyenty-five. John C.
Nobmann is the president of the whole
salers' association and J. C. Hurley is
president of the new organization.
The wholesalers gave a very enjoyable
picnic last June. Now that the new asso
ciation intends to hold a picnic, too, of
its own and under the original title which
it has assumed, the wholesalers object to
it using that title.
Last week President Nobmann of the
wholesalers issued a circular and sent it
out among the grocers and tradespeople
"roasting" the new association for assum
ing the original title. Monday night the
members of the new association held a
meeting and considered that circular.
Alter some warm speeches it was finally
decided not to wash any further grocer's
linen in public, and Charles Meier was in
structed to issue a peaceful circular adver
tising the picnic and handling the subject
calmly, which he did yesterday.
Mr. Meier says that the wholesale asso
ciation cannot enjoin the new association
from holding its picnic and so the picnic
will be held. But in the circular which he
prepared t c left out the use of the words
"twenty-fiftn annual picnic" and simply
announced that the Retail Grocers' Pro
tective Union, which was organized April
1, 1871, would hold a picnic.
BUCKLEYITES GO AHEAD,
A Municipal Convention Called
for the Middle of Sep
tember.
A Committee of Lawyers and Weekly
Meetings of the General Commit
tee Ordered.
The Regular Democratic local organiza
tionâthat of the "Bucklcyites"' â decided
to go right ahead independently of any
thing and everybody at a meeting of the
executive committee held last night, over
which Chairman M. J. Donovan presided.
The meeting was neld in the new head
quarters of the organization at 'JO and 24
Ellis street, which are the largest and
mos t convenient if not the mo>t at
tractive occupied by any party in any
recent campaign. The Buckleyites have
taken two large front suites of two rooms
each and a connecting hall capable of
holding about 600 people if a good many
of them stand up. As the Buckleyites
have on various occasions packed Odd
Fellows' and B'nai B'rith halls at their
meetings, their future sessions on Ellis
ttreet promise to be suffocating.
It was not so much by their large, new
quarters as by their ordering o/ a primary
election and a municipal convention that
the Regular Democracy declared itself in
the middle of tne ring last night.
The postponed resolution offered at tbe
last meeting by Secretary D. M. Gavigan
was taken and discussed. There being no
apparent indications that anybody but
themselves wanted party harmony on a
fair basis the resolution was unanimously
and enthusiastically adopted. It pro
vided for a primary election on September
11 and a municipal convention on Sep
tember 15.
The chairman was authorized to appoint
a committee of fivÂ«Â» lawyers, who may or
may not be members of the organization,
to right tbe legal battles of the faction any
and every w.iere, through thick and thin.
The chief legal battle ahead is the claim
of this organization to the regular party
designation on tbe official ballot, and for
this there is much legal evidence and war
like effort in store.
It was decided that the municipal con
vention should consist of 450 members,
23 to be chosen by each district and two to
be elected at large from each district.
Another interesting step was taken
when it was ordered that there should
hereafter be weekly meetings of the gen
eral committee on Monday evenings. This
will be the order from now on, beginning
next Monday evening.
This step is taken to give the widest pos
sible play to the principle of popular rep
resentation in the management of the af
fairs of the party and to keep the mass of
party- workers interested and in touch
with what is being done.
The Junta is now interested wholly in
tbe appointment of election officers, and
meantime various schemes for holding a
convention, for which the delegates are to
be appointed, are being discussed.
DAVIS' ANNUAL REPORT.
The Chief Market Inspector
Makes Some Pertinent
Suggestions.
Market Inspector Ben Davis haa ren
dered his annual report to the Hoard of
Health in which many pertinent sugges
tions regarding health regulations as well
as interesting figures on the seizures of
the year are given.
The most important suggestion relates
to the hanging of meats outside of butcher
snops, which is declared to be dangerous
to the health ot the public tfcat eats of the
meat. The report is in part as follows:
I would respectfully call the attention of
your honorable body to the present Door and
inefficient laws governing this branch of the
service. They are far below any of the various
Eastern cities in regard to the thorough in
spection of meats and markets and are lacking
in all the essential points at present included
in the market laws adopted by these cities.
With a new set ot laws, placing this City on a
par with those in the East, my assistants and
myself could do much more efficient service,
in spite of the well-known fact that it is almost
an impossibility for such a small force to
watch every point throughout the City sus
pected of being an ingress lor poor meats.
I would also recommend tnat the board
pass an order prohibiting the hanging of
meats outside of markets in this City. The I
reason for this is that the meats become im
pregnated with dust from the streets, and in
some cases with the germs of disease. In the
poorer sections of the City this is quite no
ticeable. Such regulations aie now in force
in Eastern cities.
The following statistics are given:
Markets inspected, 2861; restaurants, 54;
bakeries, 12; vegetable-stands, 241; poultry
stores, 128.
Meat seized: Beef, 4723 pounds; shark,
1600pounas; herrings, 2000 pounas; hali
but, 950 pounds; chickena, 889 pounds;
fish, 1200 pounds.
There were twenty-one arrests made for
violations of the health regulations and
seventeen convictions secured.
TROUBLESOME
ELECTION LAWS,
Registrar W. M. Hinton's
Version of Their Op
eration.
THE PEOPLE CONFUSED.
There Is Comparatively Little
of Intentional Fraud
He Thinks.
INCREASE OF REGISTRATION.
Course Taken With All Applicants
for Appointment as Election
O.ficers.
"Under the present new election law,"
said Registrar William M. Hinton. "there
exists a general confusion of thought,
but ocmparatively little intentional
fraud. For instance, a man came
here the other day and within fif
teen minutes had registered bimself
from two distinct precincts. When
my attention was called to it I sent for the
man, and after carefully cross-examining
him came to the conclusion tnat he was
entirely innocent of any intentional fraud.
He was simply excited and confused.
Under given conditions, you know, such
things are sure to occur.
"A higher moral tone, I think, prevails
this year among the representatives of
both the Republican and Democratic par
ties than at the election two years ago. I
have more time for the printing and puri
fication of the register than formerly and
the results are sure to be beneficial.
"There are cases of men who apply for
appointments as election officers who,
upon investigation, are found not to be resi
dents of the precincts rrom where they
make applications. All such names are
promptly rejected, also all applicants who
served upon boards of election in which
there was proved to have beer, any fraudu
lent registration.
"All applicants for appointment are re
ported upon originally by tne accredited
representatives of their respective political
parties and then subjected to an investiga
tion by my deputies. My repcrt is filed
with the Board of Election Commissioners
and its final decision is based upon the
ascertained facts, the parties, when neces
sary, being cited to appear before the Com
missioners. As a rule, when men find
that tney have made a mistake as to the
precinct in which they reside they with
draw their application without any
contest.
"The changes in the boundaries and
numbers of the several election precincts
have naturally been productive of a great
deal of confusion among electors, but I
think there is less fraud now than there
was two years ago. The doiiy newspapers
make many sensational and unauthorized
statements, which are calculated to excite
and mislead the people.
"So far only half a dozen men have been
cited to appear before the Board of Elec
tion Commissioners to show cause why
their names should not be stricken from
the register. Two of them were convicted
of false swearing as to their places of resi
dence and three were disqualified because
they could not read the English language.
"The total registration at the City Hall
in 1894; was 42,248, while this year the reg
istration to date is 48,030, with six more
days to run. Unless it. is staved by an or
der of the Supreme Court, there will be
precinct registration this year, beginning
Monday, August 3, at 9a. m., and ending
Monday, August 10, at 10 p. m. This will
give every qualified elector a fair chance to
get registered. Of coarse, whenever I find
any cases of seemingly fraudulent registra
tion I report them to the Grand Jury, and
in the administration of the business of
my office I tate all possible precautions
to prevent fraud and to secure an honest
registration of voters, irrespective of the
political party to which they may belong."
BRITONS IN OAKLAND.
They Banquet and Receive and
Throw Beautiful Bouquets of
Appreciation.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 28.â The banquet
to the delegates of the seventh convention
of the order of the Sons of St. Georee ten
dered by the San Francisco and Oakland
lodges was held in the Galindo Hotel to
night. Fully 200 delegates were present
aad partook of a bountiful repast. The
dining-room was beautifully decorated
with the stars and stripes and the union
jack.
The first toast drunk was "The President
of the United States,', and was responded
to by Congressman Hilborn. He said:
"The Englishmen are the custodians of
the eartn. The English literature is the
literature of the earth. Tne English dead
in Westminster Abbey me the dead of the
world. Outsiae of every four years, when
we have a Presidential election, we are
brothers. At tiiat time we must twist the
lion's tail. We are guaranteed that right
by our constitution, yea by our very Dec
laration of Independence."
He then paid a glowing tribute to all
of our Presidents from Washington down.
He closed in these words:
"LaÂ«t but not least the last occupant of
the White House. That man has left a
greater impression qf his personality than
any other man that ever held the position.
We are proud of our Presidents because
they are the highest type of manhood.''
He was followed by D. Edward Collins
who responded in glowing terms to the
toaÃt "Her Britannic Majesty Queen Vic
toria."
"Order of St. George" was responded to
by President Edward Oliver, of the Grand
Lodge, who set forth its principles. Rev.
Josiah Sims responded to "The Anglo-
Saxon Race" and was applauded continu
ously in his references to the Anglo-mani
acs-
"The Land We Live In" was responded
to by Hon. W. R. Davis.
Owing to the lateness of the hour Mr.
Davis simply proposed three cheers for
America, which were given with a vim.
Judge Ogden was called upon to respond
to "Our Public Institutions" in the ab
sence of Hon. George C. Pardee, who was
detained by sickness. He paid a glowine
tribute to the public schools in which the
children could be prepared for the Presi
dency, for the bench or for the halls of
Congress. "Upon the maintenance of our
public school depends the life of oar
Nation," said he in closing.
"Kindred Organizations' was the toast
tnat Judge Gibson responded to. He
said: "This is an ace of organization. If
a man don't belong to at least half a dozen
he is not in it."
J. T. Bell of the Oakland Enquirer re
sponded to "The Press," after which, the
company broke up with cheers.

FOX PRESIDENT-

FOR VICF-PRKSIDEXT-
GASRET A. HOBART, or New Jersey
ELECTION NOVEMBER 3. 1896.
â Watson will stick and Sewall is stuck.
The double-tailed Bryan bird may pose
like a peacock, but he is a jay.
Bryan's originality in oratory consists
solely in the boldness of his plagiarism.
Some call it "demopulism" and some
call it "popniocracy/' but all admit it is a
bad mixture. HEH
The country will take notice there are
neither evasions nor plagiarisms in Me-
Kinley's speeches.
â¢ The Populist leaders made a trade with
Democracy, but they will have a hard
time delivering the goods.
If Bryan had his way he would swap
off Sewall and Watson for a monkey and
a parrot before the week is over.
It will not be long before the boy orator
of the Platte finds out that â he cannot
* elevate politics by hippodroming.
Cleveland- may have furnished ; Democ
* racy with the slaughter-house, but it is
digging the grave with its own hands.
. The Populists are kicking themselves
just now, but before . long they will be
kicking the Democrats who deceived
them.
The weather in the East seems deter
mined to keep up with the political barom
* eter, and they are having a stormy time of
it everywhere.
McKinley's recent speeches have been
short, but all the same they have never
failed to reach both, the point and the
popular heart.
As the Golden Gate festival has been
postponed until spring the Democrats
will have no chance to feel : happy about
anything this fall.
All Democrats are not anarchists, but
all discontented people with anarchical
tendencies are supporting this year the
Democratic ticket.
It is clearly evident that eternal vigi
lance is the price of the liberty of getting
your vote counted right as long as Demo
cratic officials run the elections. .
The common-sense of this country is on
the side of sound money, sound business
and sound politics, and all < these are
represented by William McKin ley.
Every Republican of energy and influ
ence should take part in the campaign of
education. Let us make it a house to
house canvass for the prosperity of the
home.
Â»
As many Democrats are ; bolting the
Chicago platform because of its revolu
tionary declarations as because of the
irresponsible character of the candidate
who stands on it.
Â»
About the worst crown of , thorns that
t could be pressed upon the brow oi Ameri
can labor would be free trade in the prod- i
, ucts of pauper labor, and Bryan is eager j
to press that crown down, until the blood
comes.
In the campaign for protection to Ameri
can industry every workshop â¢ will be a
N school of instruction in Republican doc
trine, and every intelligent workman who !
is out of employment will bean agent to '
proclaim it on the streets.
Men who would swear falsely in order to
get positions as election officers could be
easily induced to swear, falsely as to the '
count of the votes, and it is fortunate that
some of them have been discovered before
they could get in their work. â 
Conservative Democrats declare the Chi
cago platform is tainted with Populism,
while earnest Populists declare it is tainted
with Democratic corruption; but all agree
it is tainted with something unwholesome
to the country and ought to be buried.
The publication of a letter from Cleve
. land written in 1892, in which he predicted
the comine 1 folly of the Southern; Demo
crats on the money question, vindicates
the stuffed prophet from the. charge of
having been stuffed with nothing bat ig
norance all these years. â¢'â ' -, â¢
Bryan will go to New York to be notified
of h;s nomination . by the Democrats, to
Baltimore to be notified by the silver men,
to some other city to be notified by the
Populists, and if be will come to San
Francisco about November 3 he can be
notified here of his defeat.
The Populist demand that tbe Demo
crats shall pull down their candidate lor
the Vice- Presidency is gall, but Whitney's
demand that McKinley shall drop the
.. issue of protection and make the fight
solely for the gold standard is a degree of \
impudence for which our language has no ,
word.
M'KINLEY'S SPEECHES.
No thoughtful person has failed to mark
the difference between the public utter
ances of Mr. McKinley and Mr. Bryan.
Mr. Bryan climbs upon the wings of
ilowery rhetoric and sails about like a
painted balloon which, upon landing, is
found to contain nothing substantial. It
pleases the eye while it sails through the
air, and the ear is charmed at the music
ol tha escaping propelling power, but he
says nothing to satisfy inquiry or feed
thought upon, lie submits no analysis of
economic problem?. He merely asserts
and submits no testimony.
Mr. McKinley talks but little, and yet
there is more substance in a single sen
tence of one of his speeches than in a vol
ume of Bryan's rhetorical patchwork.
For instance, Mr. Bryan says: "You shall
not crucify labor on a cross of gold/ Mr.
McKinley says: "Our need embraces an
honest dollar, an untarnished National
credit, adequate revenues for the uses of
the Government, protection to labor and
industry, preservation of the home market
and reciprocity which will extend our
foreign markets." There is evidence
abundant of dignity, statesmanship, pa
triotism aud ol' an honest desire to see
tbe conditions of existence in this country
grow from pood to better to best in what
Mr. McKinley said. There is in that one
sentence the essence of our system of gov
ernment, and the political economist
would find enough in it to build a volume
of analytical deductions upon.
It will be observed that there are two
central thoughts in this one sentence from
one of Mr. McKinley's "short talks." The
first is the integrity of the Nation and the
second is the welfare of labor. There is no
talk of "crucifying" anybody, but it meana
a patriotic working together of all the peo
ple for the Nation's honor and the people's
good. Mr. McKinley would give ample
encouragement to every form of trade,
traffic and induetry, but the paramount
thing to be secured is comfortable and
remunerative conditions for the mechani
cal skill and tbe brawn of the country.
To that end he would have honest dollars,
home markets and home industries se
cured against the shoddy goods and pauper
labor of countries who would force our
labor into idleness and close our avenues
of wealth accumulation. The very essence
of those things which have to be to make
a government of the people, by the people
and for tbe people is found in the one sen
tence quoted from one of Mr. McKinley's
recent talVs to neighbors. He does not
talk of "crowns of thorns," but of peace,
prosperity and happiness for the people.
WOOL UNDER TREE TRADE.
Tue Call to-day publishes the first of
two articles on the wool industry, po
affected Dy the Democratic policy of free
trade. A careful study of the facts pre
sented will convince the most skeptical
that something is vitally wrong with the
wool industry. An analysis of these facts
will convince the student of conditions
that the industry has been struck a fatal
blow by free trade.
Whether tbe state of tbe wool business
in this State alor.e or in the entire Union
is studied, the conclusion is inevitable
that no American sheen-raiser and no
American wool-dealer can coaipete with
the goods that foreigners send into
the country at prices that cannot be met
in this land of high wages and better
standards of living. The market reports
from all centers report a paralysis of
business, with more than half the manu
facturing plants idle. These conditions
fulfill the prophecies of McKinley and bis
friends, prophecies tbat were laughed at
hy those who held up the Democratic
idol of free trade as a panacea for our in
dustrial ills.
In yie great manufacturing districts of
the New England States the shrewdest
dealers hare been unable to continue busi
ness without interruption. They have been
crushed by the fierce competition of for
eigners anxious to control the American
market. In California the wool clip of the
past year falls 5.000,000 pounds short of the
normal yield, simply because men who
have heretofore devoted their money and
energies to wool-growing have been
forced to sell their sheep for mutton to
enable them to survive the depression of
tbese perilous Democratic times.
In the light of the incontrovertible facts
presented how puerile now seems the rea
soning of the Democrats who urged the
Wilson bill as a blessing to the country!
Those who repealed the McKinley law
urged that the fine foreign wools would
cause a demand for tbe home product, be
cause manufatturers would want a mix
ture; yet month after month the depres
sion has continued until wool-growers are
to-day crushed iv every part of the country.
Fan Francisco is an example in point.
Here nearly ali the warehouses are closed.
Humboldt wool tnat brought 25 and 30
cents in the grease a few years ago does
not move now at 11 and 12 cents, and
growers are discouraged. All admit that
their only hope is a return to protection
and prosperity.
It should be borne in mind that wool
is but one striking object lesson in many.
As free trade has paralzyed one industry it
will paralyze others, and if Democratic
prophets are wrong about one policy they
are equally untrustworthy in others. We
commend the reading of the story which
tells of the downfall of the wool industry
to all impartial investigators, irrespective
of their party beliefs and affiliations.
LIKE A HERD OF CATTLE.
Tbe information comes from the Popu
list party's headquarters in St. Louis that
Mr. Bryan will not be formally notified of
I his nomination by that party, and the in
formation comes also that the Democratic
National Committee will withdraw Mr.
Bryan's name from the Populist ticket.
It is safe to say that tbe first is true and
I that the latter is without the slightest
foundation in fact. The tactics of the
Populist traitors and their Democratic
purchasers do not warrant the belief that
they have decency enough to right the
great wrong they have done the honest
wing of the Populist party by either put
ting Mr. Bryan in the awkward position
which would come of formally notifying
him of his nomination, or of withdrawing
his name from ;he ticket.
The Populist convention was sold to
Mr. Bryan just as droves of cattle are
sold. The cattle had no voice in the
transaction. No doubt there is a secret
understanding which insures certain fat
offices in the event of Bryan's election,
but that is none of the business of the
rank and file.
By not formally notifying Mr. Bryan of
his nomination by the Populist conven
tion the complete sale of the party is im
plied. The rule has always been since the
institution of nominating conventions
that the candidates should tate advantage
of the occasion of the formal notification
of their nomination to place themselves
upon the platform and to enlarge upon its
more important declarations. This course
has always been deemed necessary be
cause it was the only way the party had
of knowing tbat the candidates were in
1 accord with the party's principles.
But the bosses of the Populist party look
1 upou ilie rani aad fiieas theiioira faÂ«rd

of cattle, to do with as they like, and they
would regard it as insufferably presump
tuous in one or any number of the animals
to object to going into the pen designated
by the herdsmen. No such an effort was
ever before made by professional politi
cians to deal with the voters of a party
after the manner of the old-time slave
trader, and it all sugests the thought that
the aftermath of the Populist convention
would make ample material for a "tale of
woe" on the lines of "Uncle Tom's Cabin."
AN ITINERANT HIPODROME.
The once staid and dignified Democratic
party has been transformed into a verita
ble itinerant hippodrome, but the propor
tion of wild asses to thoroughbred horses
is too great to give proper balance to the
performance. It lias been decided that
{ after Mr. Bryan has been notified of his
I nomination by tbe Chicago convention in
! Madison-square Garden he will proceed to
> Baltimore, where be will again be "noti
| tied."\~The programme provides for "a
one-night stand" in several of the Eastern
cities, with daylight parades.
After the East has been "played to" this
; circus will perform in the principal towns
of the Middle and Western States. The
1 advance agent has not authorized the bill
-1 oster to "bill" any towns other than New
I York snd Baltimore, as the "booking" of
1 tbe show has not been completed for tbe
\ season, but in a week or two the whole
I route will be announced. When the show
I goes south of Mason and Dixou's line
j there will be a change in the cast of cbar-
I acters; that is to say, Sewall will retiie
I and Watson will don the cap and bells,
' but the main features of the performance
! will continue tbe same throughout. The
! main feature will be, of course, Mr. Bryan's
j famous "crown of thorns and cross of
gold" act.
While the 9how is in the South and Mr.
Watson is wearing the cap and bells it is
possible tbat Mr. Sewall may run a side
show iv the North for the edification of
labor. If he does he will have the stage
set so as to represent one of his many ships
at sea. A number of seedy and hungry
looking sailors will be heard complaining
of the hard fare and brutal treatment on
j Sewall's ships. Then there will appear an
I officer or two of the ship who will rush
i upon the hungry men and put those who
I talked the loudest in irons. The drop cur-
I tain will then fall and upon it wiil be seen
j Mr. Sewall's home m Bath, Maine, which
, will have for a background his ten Na
tional banks, his railways and his other
corporate interests. Only a little stretch
i of the imagination will be required to see
I scores of sailor Lazarusea begging for a
! few crumbs of bread from the would-be
Vice- President's table. Working people,
especially seamea, should not fail to see
Sewall's show. It will be worth their while
10 '"take it all in."
FRAUDS DISCOVERED.
The discovery that a number of persons
named for election officers in this City had
registered falsely in order to obtain the
positions they desired comes at the right
time to awaken the public mind to the im
\ portance of keeping a careful watch on
I every step that is taken by the Democratic
officials who control the election board.
Men who would swear falsely to obtain
! offices where the pay is insignificant are
I hardly the class of men to whom can be
j safely intrusted the counting of votes in
au election that will be so hotly contested
as the one which is now approaching.
Honest men of all parties ov;e thanks to
' T. J. L. Smiley, vrho represents the Repub
lican County Committee before the Elec-
I tion Commissioners, ;for discovering theÂ«e
j frauds and exposing them. His vigilance
! should be supported by the public eener-
I ally. The welfare of the Republic is based
! to a very large extent upon the ballot-box
I If fraud and rascality control the counting
of votes, popular elections will be a farce,
and the government will soon be one con
ducted by rascals for the benefit of rascals.
We must have honesty at the ballot-box as
well as in the jury-box- and those who pre
side at the polling-places should be as hon
oranle as those who preside in our courts.
That frauds will be attempted by the
Democrats in this election is beyond ques
tion. The record of that party in the past
gives assurance of what it will do in the
future if it can. One trick of the fraudu
lent element ha? been exposed and
blocked. The fellows who registered
falÂ«dy will not be election officials this
year. That much is good as far as it
goes, but vigilance must be kept up con
tinually. The trick that has been baffled
is not the only one that corruption knows.
There are other-.
AS TO NEBRASKA.
Because Mr. Bryan lives in Nebraska
and because a Populist Governor was
elected two years ago by Democratic-Pop
ulist fusion there are Republicans who are
disposed to put tbat State ln the Bryan
column. The truth is that Mr. Bryan has
no more show in other States than he" has
in Nebraska he will not have a single
electoral vote. It is very true that the free
silver Democrats and Populists did fuse two
years ago, and that the Populist candidate
for Governor was elected by a small ma
jority.
The situation in Nebraska that year
was this: The head of the Republican
ticket was very objectionable to the better
element of the party, and tbe State Con
vention was warned that if that particular
individual was made tne candidate for
Governor the party itself would defeat
him. He was nominated, however, and
as a result the Omaha Bee, the party's
Bute organ, supported and elected the
Populist candidate. To show tha Bce'g
influence it only need be stated that every
other Republican candidate on the State
ticket was elected and that the Legisla
ture was four-fifths Republican. The
combined vote of the Populists and free
silver Democrats would not have elected
Holcomb, the Populist caudidate, by 20,
--000.
The election last fall, which was for Su
preme Judge and county officers, was
strictly on party lines, and the Republican
majority was larger than the total vote of
the free-silver Democrats, while the ad
ministration or anti-Bryan Democrats
polled more than twice as many votes for
their candidate for Supreme Judge than
were polled for Bryan's free-silver candi
date. There Is just as much certainty that
Nebraska will be carried by McKinley as
there is that he will carry Vermont.

"Ich Dies"â X. T., City. "Ich Dien," tfte
motto of the Prince of Wales, is German and
means "I serve." The usually accepted story
of its origin is that it was in the fourteenth
century the motto of the Kings of Bohemia
and that at tbe battle of Crecy in 1345 the
Black Prince killed tbe King of Bohemia, took
tbe motto which the latter wore on his helmet
and assumed it himself to Indicate that be,
too, served his country. An English writer says
the statement that these words were tbe motto
of the King of Bohemia does not rest upon
good authority and goes on to say :
"The three plumes Mere certainly not
the crest of the King of Bohemia, which
was an eagle's wing. Verstegau, with great
probability, makes it purely Anglo-Saxon. Ie
or Ich, he tells us. meant 1, as 1 myself; and be
further says It was pronounced as we should
do if it were writien Igb, whereby it hath
some aspiration. 'Theyn,' he informs us, waa
a 'chief e or very free servant; thereof cometh
Theme,' to serve. In a subsequent article he
says 'The Prince of Wales, the King of
England's eldest son. is wont to use for his
poesie (alter our ancient English speech) the
words 'Ie Dien' for 'Ich tbaiu,' that is, 'I
serve' ; where the reader Is to remember that
d und ih were in our ancient language in
differently usefl. It is quite clear, however,
tbat after the battle ot Crecy, Edward the
Black Prince adopted tbe plume aud motto as
a crest, and it has since been borne by the
heirs to the crown of England as
such." Another tradition of the origin is
in that Edward I conquered tbe people of
Wales after a long and stubborn fight on the
part of the latter. To win the favor of tnese
unwilling subjects be promised to give them
for a ruler a prince who was born in Wales
and who could not speak a word of English.
A few days after this promise was made the
English Queen â then staying at Carnarvon,
Wales, to be near the Kingâ gave birth to a
son, aud this infant the Kiug brought before
the Assembly, saying to them in Welsh, "Eich
dydn," meaning "behold tbe man." Whether
this be truft or not, it is a historical fact that
the young English Prince was at that time and
under those circumstance* born in Wales, and
from that fact the heir apparent to the Eng
lish throne has ever since had the title of
Prince of Wales.

Swimmingly â Miss Anthony to
Lecture at Santa Cruz
Mrs. Perley's punchbowl, which some
fair devotees of Father Mathew persist in
calling a lemonade vat, has become one of
the lions of the Woman Suffrage Bureau.
The Call's glowing though inadequate
description of its beauties caused many
art critics to visit the bureau yesterday. A
popular clergyman, who has long worn
the pretty suffragist badge, lost no time in
making his way to the bureau, where he
feasted his longing eyes upon the lovely,
albeit empty, bowl.
Several Chinese also went to see how the

dimes, which must correspond in
number with the votes, are to be hence
forth deposited. The box is of eenerous
proportions, and it was thought that it
would be sufficient to empty it each day
after office hours; but if dimes and votes
continue to come in as they did all day
the operation will have to be gone through
with at least three times daily.
The precinct cJub work is getting on
famously. Mrs. Clara Long, the City or

ing clubs, some districts having as many
as seven. Mrs. Naomi Anderson, the elo
quent colored lady orator, has also organ

suffragists, of which Mrs. Martin has been
elected president. The distribution of
literature is likewise going on at a rattling
pace. A project is on foot for crystalliz
ing some of the most telling arguments in
favor of woman suffrage into short sen
tences, to be printed in large letters on
"dodgers" and distributed by the hun
dred thousand.

NO CASTS OF THE LEAD
The Pigeon Point Signal Said to
Have Been Out of
Order.
WAS NOT HEARD THAT NIGHT
Captains Had Been Instructed to
Place No Dependence on Fog
Whistles.
Captain Clark of the wrecked steamship
Colombia was before Captain Bermingham,
United States Inspector of Hulls and Boil
ers, yesterday, to tight for his license. He
Captain Clark as He Told His Story to Captain Bermingham and a Stenographer
and some of his officers were examined as
to what happened just before the wreck
and how it was that the ship came to be
hung up on the Pigeon Point reef.
R. P. Schwerin, vice-president and man
a?er of the Pacific Mail Company, came in
while the examination was in progress,
and he was allowed to question the wit
nesses, and then at tne end be took the
stand himself. The stories told did not
differ much from the accounts of the
wreck which have been published, but
there was one fact added which had not
previously been brought to light. It ap
peared from the testimony of George T.
Bright, who was the lookout at the time
tbe vessel struck, that shortly after the
acciaeni a pray-haired man came
aboard from a small boat and said
he was the keeper of the lighthouse on
Pigeon Point. He said he wanted to clear
himself â tnat sometimes the fog-whistle
worked and sometimes it didn't, and more
words leading to the inference that the
whistle had not been working properly, or
had not been worKing at all. Later
Charles McCarthy, a quartermaster, testi
fied that when he went ashore in the first
boat he met two young ladies who told
him the fog signal had not been going
during the night.
Captain Clark's story failed to explain
the disaster. lie said be had never, in all
his experience as a master on this coast,
passed close enough to Ano Nueva to hear
the fog signal there, and so when he heard
the signal there he at once concluded it
was Pigeon Point. He calculated that he
was about five miles off Ano Nueva, or, as
he thought, Pigeon Point, but had he been
that distance off shore the course he laid
would have carried him clear of Pigeon
Point. He said he took no soundings, bnt
the lead was ready on tne bridge in case
of sudden necessity. When she struck,
tbe captain said, tbe Colombia was mak
ing thirteen and a half knots.
John Thompson, the third officer, told
how he and the captain had debated over
a fog signal they heard, and concluded
that it was the Pigeon Point whistle, and
that they were about five miles off shore,
by the sound. He said he heard but two
or three faint blasts of the signal ahead,
the Pigeon Point signal, and these sounded
like one blast, not Jiite the double blast
which is peculiar to that signal.
Charles Olsen, the second officer, told
a story substantially tbe same, so far as the
run from Point Bur was concerned. He
was not on watch when the vessel struck.
Pilot George D. Korts was called to tell
what he knew of the fog signals on Pigeon
Point and Ano Nueva. Then Bright tes
tified and then McCarthy.
Captain Clark was then called once more
and Mr. Scbwerin began to question him.
He had not gone far, however, when Cap
tain Bermingham stopped him, saying
that the questions he asked had already
been cone over. Mr. Schwerin then said
he thought be had a right to question tbe
witness, as tbe Pacific Mail was a party
vitally interested. He said be bad prop
erty at tbe mercy of captains licensed by
the Government and he should have the
right to show whether or not these cap
tains are qualified for their trust, be
wanted to show that the Pacific Mail Com
pany's bad positive instructions to place
no dependence in fog signals.
It was suggested that Mr. Schwerin be
sworn, and when this had been dorr? he
told how Captain Clark had come to have
command of the Colombia. When the
ship came out, he said. Captain Clark was
put in charge and told that she was to be
made as popular as possible.
Schwerin told the captain he bad had
peculiar ideas about the lead line, that it
was the best friend a captain ever bud and
that he wished no chances taken, either in
running in or out of a port in a fog. or at
any point in thick weather, and that it
was much easier to find bottom with a
lead than with the ship's keel. He said
Clark bad been in the company's service
for twenty-six, years, and that he con
sidered the captain in every way fitted to
take command of the Colombia â that is,
before she ran on the rocks.
JAILED FOR CONTEMPT.
K. P. .Meriilion Has to Fay the Penalty
for Disobeying Judge Hebbard.
Jndge Hebbard yesterday committed
R. P. Meriilion to jail for two days and
fined him $100 for contempt of court
Meriilion some time ago was engaged in
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JULY 29, 1896.
the box manufacturing business and sold
out to H. B. Meyer. It was stipulated at
the time that Meriilion should not re
engage in the business in this City. He,
however, subsequently entered the employ
of the American Box Comyany as a solic
itor.
Thereupon Meyer had an injunction
iseued commanding Merillion to live up
to the terms of his contract. This he
promised to do, but recently he has been
again soliciting patronage for the Ameri
can Box Company. Consequently Judge
Hebbard committed him for contempt.
The case will in all probability go to the
Supreme Court.
CUNNINGHAM ARRESTED.
The Ex-Secretary of the Veterinary De
partment Has Not Settled.
A. A. Cunningham, ex-secretary of the
veterinary department of the State Uni
versity, was arrested yesterday on a com
plaint charging him with misdemeanor
embezzlement. He was immediately re
leased on $300 bonds.
The complaint was sworn to yesterday
morning in Judge Conlan's court by Dr.
W. F. Egan, treasurer of the department,
and the amount alleged to have been em
bezzled is $212.
Last Thursday Dr. Egan applied for the
warrant but did not swear to it, as he
wanted to see if Cunningham would re
fund tbe money he had misappropriated,
which at tbe lowest calculation was esti
mated at $212. At that time full particu
lars of the affair were published.

tbe spring months for tne carnival and
their subscriptions were based upon the
same understanding. They will be seen
during tne next few days and announce
ments made of the amounts subscribed.
A second order for 25,000 carnival bat
tons was placed yesterday. It is expected
to have the first lot on sale about Septem
ber 1. They will be retailed at 10 cents
and the proceeds applied to meeting the
running expenses of the carnival.
The chairmanship of the finance com
mittee will be tilled in a few days. Gen
eral Warfield has in view one of the most
prominent and energetic business men of
the ci:y who has successfully conducted
several large enterprises. The position,
which is one of considerable responsibility,
has been offered him and be has taken the
matter under advisement.
Six bids for printing the official souvenir
programme were received op Monday.
The printing committee has decided to re
turn all bids unopened, and advertise
again under tbe changed conditions.
The managers of the whale banting ex
pedition will open an office at the carnival
headquarters this week. When the ceta
cean is captured it will be towed ashore
and exhibited for the benefit of the car
nival. The members of the executive
committee believe it will be a strong at
traction, especially after being out of the
water a few days.
DISSOLVED THE ORDER.
Judge Seawell Decide* Against the Jor
dan Company.
Judge Beawell yesterday dismissed the
writ of certiorari issued at the instance of
the Joidan Bituminous Rock Company,
commanding the Board of Supervisors to
explain its action in awarding the Folsom
street paving contract to the City Improve
ment Company. He also dissolved the
temporary restraining order which pro
hibited Auditor Broderick issuing a war
rant on the City treasury for payment for
the work.
Some time ago the JorJan Company filed
a suit claiming that the Board of Super
visors bad discriminated against it in the
matter of letting the Folsom-street con-
I tract because its bitumen was brought to
Fan Francisco by water instead of on the
cars of the Southern Pacific Company
Attorney Garret McEnerney, in behalf of
the board, argued the matter before Judge
Seawell yesterday, and Cnarles F. Hanlon
represented the Jordan Company His
Honor decided that the board had acted
in a fair and legal manner throughout and
so dismissed the writ and dissolved the
order restraining partial payment for the
work done.
Snit on a Mortgage.
The Gennania Savings and Loan Society has
begun suit to foreclose a mortgage on the
property at the southwest corner of Twentieth
and Howard streets. The snit 1% brought
against Fabian Joost et al. The amount of
money involved is f 16,000. a balance due on
a note lor $40,000 made August 4, 1891.

NOT A CLOSE CONTEST.

HE HAS TO "SdUAEE" HIMSELF
Presented a Friend With a Dczen of
the Hard Boiled Variety for a
Setting.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's Aus
tralia arrived from Honolulu yesterday
with a lull list of passengers. Those in the
cabin were:
Colonel F. L. Guenther, Miss Guenther, Colo
nel William Macdonald, Mrs. H. Morrison,
Mrs. J. L. Mauerer, F. Homer and wife, R. 1.
Lillie and wile, B. T. McCullough, Theodore

aam, Miss L Roberta, C. Â£. Rice and H. Pohl
mann.
On the 12th inst. the Australia sailed for
Honolulu and three hours later the Pacific
Mail Company's City of Peking sailed for
the same port. Bets were freely made on
the race and in every instance tbe Peking
was the favorite. The Australia won easily,
getting into Honolulu at 6:40 p. m. on the
17th, while the Peking did not reach port
until 4 o'clock the next morning. Owing
to the strike in the Newcastle collieries the
Australia had very poor coal in her bunk
ers and Chief Enpineer Neiman is of the
opinion that with good coal tae trip coula
easily have been shortened twelve hours.
When the Australia leaves port again
Chief Steward T. K. James will take along
with him a dozen eggs from the best bred
chickens in the State. He is procuring
them for Clarence McFarland, brother of
the colonel, and they are to be used as a
peace offering.
McFarland is a chicken fancier, and for
months he has been after James to bring
him down some fancy eggs. James
always promised faithfully, but tbe
promise always slipped his memory.
When the steamer was passing through
the Golden Gate on the 12th inst. he sud
denly remembered the eggs and was in
despair. A bright idea struck him. and
going into tbe pantry he selected a dozen
of the largest and best-looking eggs in a
large box. These he told the cook to boil
nard and then wrap neatly in tissue.
When the Australia reached Honolulu
James handed over the eggs to McFar
land, who, in his joy at securing them,
opened a bottle of wine. Last advices re
ceived before the steamer sailed were to
the effect that McFurland's hen was pa
tiently setting on the hard-boiled eggs.
The above is the true reason why genial
Tom James is anxious to purchase fancy
eggs at any price before the Australia
sails again for Honolulu. Chief Officer
Lawless asserts that the hen will have
hatched out an omelette before the Aus
tralia gets back to Hawaii.
The Oceanic Steamship Company and
the Snreckels Towboat Company will
move from Folsom-street wharf to the
Pacific-street wharf in about a fort
night. It was so decided at a meeting
of the Harbor Commissioners yesterday.
Commissioner Colnon was very "much op
posed to the moving of the towboats and
wanted them stationed at Howard No. 2.
He insisted that a wharf which had cost
$50,000 to build should not be given over
to craft of that description.
John D. Spreckels argued that the best
wharves on the front should be given over
to ocean steamers and that inasmuch as
tbe Oceanic was a local concern and spent
all its money bere, some consideration
should be shown. With tbe Australian
and Hawaiian steamers docking at Pacific
street the wharf would have to be bonded
and it would be a great hardship to have
outside schooners docking there.
Chief Wharfinger Root gave it as his
opinion that it would give rise to endless
trouble to hnve any small craft docking at
Pacific street and Mr. Spreckels pointed
out that only two steamers could lie along
side the wharf and that then there would
just be room for the tugs. "No matter
what comes or goes," said he, "we must
nave a tug there with steam up night and
day in order to put ont fires. By putting
all the vessels at one dock you "will save
room and we will save the expense of run
ning two offices."
Commissioners Chadbonrne and Cole
were in favor of granting Mr. Spreckels'
request on the ground thnt the change was
only temporary, and President Colnan
finally gave in. When Folsom street
wharf is rebuilt it is expected that the ves
sels in question will move back again.
Edward R. Swain, the board's architect,
recommended certain changes in the new
ferry depot. As it would entail an addi
tional expenditure of $2960 the matter wns
taken under advisement and the Com
missioners will look into the matter.
Some weeks ago tbe whaleback City of
Everett drifted down on a dolphin at Mis
sion 3 and carried it away. A bill for $226
wa^sent in by thfÂ» rommissioners.butwhen
Superintendent of Construction Patterson
said the rile? were rotten tie bill was re
duced to $113.
Captain Bucknam. who was formerly
master of the City of Everett, goes out as
chief officer of the City of Sydney.
The schooner Chetco was towed back to
the wreck of the Colombia yesterday.
There is about seventy tons of recovered
froicrht awaiting her and on its arrival
here it will be sold at auction.
An immense quantity of fruit came down
on the steamers Onward, Aurora ami Re
lief yesterday from the Sacramento. Puget
Sound ports partly relieved the glut and
the Umatilla was held half an hour in
order to take away some of the surplus to
Seattle, Tacoma, Port Townsend and Vic
toria, B. C. Sergeant Tom Mahoney said
t'nat it was the busiest day that be has

years. _____________
SUED THE COMMISSIONERS.
The Widow of Policeman Stevens Bring*
Charged Against City Official*. "J..
, Theresa M.Stevens, widow of Policeman
George Stevens, , has sued the Board of
Police Pension ; Fund r Commissioners to
recover $1000 alleged to be due on a policy
on the life of her deceased husband. V
In .her complaint she alleges that i the
Commissioners have discriminated against
her claim and :in favor of other persons
whose claims were not as clear and just as
hers.. She further, e&y* that ! the defend
ants are persona of great wealth and of
exalted standing in tbe community, and
that their open disregard of the fourteenth
article of the constitution of the United
States in refusing her equal justice with
other claimants is a public scandal.
As an instance of the alleged discrimi
nation against the plaintiff, the case of
R. P. Hammond Jr., whose claim of $1000
because of the death of R. P. Hammond
Sr. was allowed, is cited.
Because of this alleged discrimination,
Mrs. Stevens asks, in addition to tbe $1000
said to be due, to be awarded $1000 dam
ages and $500 counsel fees.
POOLMEN HOLD ON.
The Celebrated Case in Sausali to , Be
fore Recorder Fryor Results In
a Disagreement.
The continuation of the case involving
the poolsellers of Sausalito was resumed
last Monday night before' Recorder ; J. H.
Pryor. The defendant was J. M. McGee,
an employe of Corbett & Co., and the
prosecuting witness , was Marshal J. E.
Green, who stated that defendant had ac
cepted $1 for a ticket on a certain horse in
a certain race.
The defense mainly rested on the tech
nicality whether McGee, acting only as a
commissioner, was responsible or not.
The court instructed the jury that it was
immaterial whether McGee was the prin
cipal or agent. The prosecution was con
ducted by A. Sylva, the Town Attorney.
Thomas P. Boyd, City Attorney of San
Rafael, appeared for the defendant.
The jury, composed of George Tasbieia,
Captain William Barrowe, Commodore C.
H. Harrison, William N. Ketcham, Con
O'Neary, John Thomas, W. H. Harrold,
William Getchler, G. Stihl, John Mason,
William Ritchie and Peter Claudianos,
retired at 9 p. m., and at 2:30 a. m. yester
day stood six for acquittal aud six for con
viction.
So the poolrooms continue in full blast.

THE INDUSTRIAL FAIR,
The Judges Nominated and* to
Be Finally Chosen Next
Week.
A Meeting of Mechanics' Institute
Trustees at Which Progress
Was Made.
The trustees of the Mechanics' Institute
held a semi-executive meeting last even
ing for the purpose of advancing the
progress of the twenty-ninth industrial
exposition of the institute, to be held in
the Mechanics' Pavilion from September 1
to October 3 next, and considerable
progress was made.
The principal business was the sug
gestion of names of men well known to be
competent to act as judges in the multi
farious departments of the exposition in
which awards are to be made to com
petitive exhibitors. A long list of names
were nominated by the members of tbe
board. The nominees will be immediately
seen and requested to act, and the result
will be reported to another meeting to be
held one week from last night.
Among the reports of committees it was
recommended ti.at the fish tanks be
repaired and completed at once; that the
glass be put in the windows at once where
needed, and that the Pavilion be well
cleaned and dusted.
It was decided to leave the competition
for designs for diplomas open for another
week. It was voted to engage thirty-eight
general employes of the exposition, about
the same number as the last exposition.
The art committee is considering the
putting in of new skylights for the art de
partment.
The indications are that the space on
the exposition floor will be well filled by
handsome displays of exhibitors.
A special feature of the exposition will
be a Roentgen ray department, where it
will be possible for the casual spectator in
the flesh to see his own skeleton.
P. J. Healey was elected to the position
of corresponding secretary.
BURNED TO DEATH.
A Little Girl Catches Fire While Play
ing; Around a Vacant Lot.
Lizzie Minehan, tbe three-year-old
daughter of Thomas Minehan, a milkman
living at 160 West Park street, died Mon
day n:ght of injuries received several
hours before. She had been playing in
a vacant lot adjoining the residence of her
parents, and it was thought that her cloth
ing caught fire from a pile of hot ashes
thrown there by Mrs. Bonn, a neighbor.
The little girl ran borne with the flames
streaming around her, and although the
tire was extinguished by her mother the
child died that night. Mr. Bonn is much
distressed over the report that she was in
directly tbe cause of the child's death, and
denies that she threw hot ashes in the lot
that day. Several hours before the acci
dent, she states, her daughter emptied a
pan of ashes there, but they were cold and
harmless. _
The Fair Case.
The attorneys for the executors of the will
of James G. Fair yesterday filed a notice to
Mrs. Craven and her legal advisers that on
Monday, August 3, they will apply for an or
der of court directing that certain papers be
brought Into court for inspection, and also
that Fair's attorneys may, if they wish, take a
copy of them.
The papers particularly desired are the mar
riage contract said to exist, and a certain let
ter dated December 16, 1894, said to have been
sent to Mrs. Craven by James G. Fair.
Efforts will also be made to have Mrs. Eliza
beth H&skins answer certain questions to
which sha ha* hitherto refused to reply.
DR. McCLISH
TO BE CHOSEN,
Will Be President of the
University of the
Pacific.
TRUSTEES ABOUT TO ACT
Result of Their Deliberations Is
Already Fully Fore
shadowed.
CALL OUT FOB AN ELECTION.
No Other Name Is Mentioned in Con
nection With the Candidacy for
the Position.
Unless Rev. Dr. Eli McClish Interposes
objection there is very little doubt that he
will be elected next week to the presidency
of the University of the Pacific by the
trustees of that institution. The notices
have been sent out by the secretary of the
Board of Trustees for a meeting to be held
in the Mills building at 10 a. m. Ausust 4,
and the special business mentioned in this
call is consideration of the selection of a
head for the university.
The name of Rev. Dr. McClish, it is set
forth in this call, will be presented. The
chairman of the Board of Trustees is I. J.
Truman. That gentleman says that Rev.
Dr. McClish will be elected in all probabil
ity. Rev. Dr. McClish's name has been
mentioned repeatedly in connection with
the position, and as no word of dissent has
been uttered the board expects to fill the
vacancy, which has existed for some
time.
Rev. Dr. McClish has been president
of an educational institution at Onarga,
111., and it was from Onarga, in fact, that
I he came to the pastorate of Grace M. E.
Church in this City about s : x years ago.
He served as pastor in San Franciso five
years and then was transferred to Napa.
j He entered the ministry in 1871, when he
was ordained by the Methodist conference
to preach, and he occupied Eastern pas
torates before he accepted the position at
Onarga. He is the president of the Qhau
tauqua assembly which meets at Mon
terey. In many directions he has achieved
prominence on the Pacific Coast and he is
considered to be entirely eligible to fill
the vacant presidency at College Park,
where the University of tbe Pacific is lo

There has been no president at the uni

Beard, wno went abroad with the inten
tion of making his resignation permanent.
Rev. M. S. Cross, the dean of the faculty,
has been at the head of affairs during thÂ«
interim. Rev. Dr. Hirst was president of
the university for a term of years. Rev.
Dr. Isaac Crook has also occupied the
presidential chair. Very likely Rev. Dr.
McClish will nave a larger number of
students to look after than have his pre
decessors. The idea is entertaiued by
those concerned in the institution that
the final closing of the institution at
Napa, which will be sold, and the con

will increase the attendance of the Uni

The solid seven of the Board of Super
visors, wherever they may have been at
the time, must have spent an exceedingly
uncomfortable two hours and a half last
pirht beginning at 8 o'clock.
Metropolitan Temple, thronged with
people, was kept echoing all that time
with bitter denunciation of tneir betrayal
of the public trust, and the more bitter
and direct and scathing the arraignment
the louder and longer the applause that
preeted it.
It was a notable occasionâ with few
parallels in the history of the City. It was
a demonstration of how entirely the people
of San Francisco are aroused to the atti
tude of the members of the majority of the
Supervisors toward the people's interests.
Did a speaker hesitate to use the most
â¢ direct terms in speaking of the accused
men the impatience of the audience be
came at once manifest by interjection of
c language that coula not be misunderstood.
Not a voice was raised or a word spoken
in behalf of the plunderers of the people.
Immense bonfires burned all the even
ing on Sixth street, at Market and at
Mission streets, and the throng of peopie
who hied up the stairs of tde Temple was
such as to occupy every nicbe in the big
hall and to overflow back again for very
Jack of room. It was a big, notable
remonstrance that was full of deep mean
ing.
On the stage were seated a great number
of the leading men of the City â solid busi
ness and professional men, who haye her
best interests at heart.
Tbe presiding officer was I. J. Truman.
It was expected that Mayor Sutro would
, hold this place, but in a letter of strong
sympathy with the spirit of the meeting,
he pointed out that his official position as
president of the board would make it un
becoming in him.
Mr. Truman in opening the proceedings,
said:
"Ladies and Gsntlemen and Fellow
citizens: You are called together at the
request of numerous taxpayers of this
great City by the Civic Federation, an
organization incorporated to promote and
. recommend what is good and to denounce
what is bad and infamous. The majority
of the present Board of Supervisors will be
presented to you to-night as having delib
erately, and we believe corruptly, be
trayed the interests of the taxpayers to
corporations. The names of the seven
should De forever on your blacklist if
they bob up for your votes in future.
"Joe King seems to be the most respecta
ble of the whole crowd. His chief recom
mendation is that he is the patromzer of
lat hunts, which could not begin till Joe's
dog arrived with 'Joe' bringing up. the
rear of the procession. I presume Peter
A. Scully, Charles E. Benjamin, Edward
C. Hughes, little Chris Dunker, A. W.
Morgenstern and E. L. Wagner came after
Joe and the dog. The City and taxpayers
are safe while Joe is rat hunting.
"Why do you elect such men ? Perhaps
for the same reason as Tom Fowler, Sena
tor from Tulare, told a committee in Sac
ramento a few years ago. The Supervisors
of that county had a bridge built by con
tract. Tne floods came and swept it away,
and Tom was trying to get an appropria
tion from the State, and some Senator
asked him why the Supervisors did not
bind the contractor to guarantee the
bridge to stand ordinary freshets. Tom's
reply was: 'Well, in Chulare when a man
is fit for nothing else they make a Chuper
visor of him.'
" I am one not of those who believe all
corporations are corrupt. They are human,
and when you elect Slippery Joes for Su
pervisors, corporations soon find that the
only way to protect themselves is to reach
their consciences through their ever-ex
tended and itching palm, and like Jim
Fisk sad in regard to his father's truth
fulness, 'Father won't tell a lie for 10
cents, but he will tell a dozen for a dollar,'
and some of this crowd is said to have
taken a squealing pig for a business favor.
"These Supervisors are accused of reduc
ing prominent corporation assessments,
which were assessed by Siebe at one- fonrth
their cash value, and these seven reduced
t'em over |2,000,000. If you owti a house
and lot which you could sell in the market
for $2000, would it be assessed for $500 and
reduced by the Supervisors to $300? No;
it would be assessed at $1500, and you
could not get a nickel off, and Joe would
not look at you.

"The precious eight, for this includes
Hirscb, has concluded that they do not

Colonel Taylor â who has made tbe finances

Letters and talecrams of sympathy were
read from several who were unable to be
present. Among them was one from
James D. Phelan, in which be regretted
his absence from tbe City and character
ized tbe action of the Supervisors as a
gross injustice to all other taxpayers.
In reading the letter from Colonel Tay

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JTJLY LÂ»9, 1896.
grand old man and honest Supervisor."
His letter is as follows :
Office C L. Tatlor, )
428 California Street, City. >
San Fraxcisco, July 28, 1896.1
I. J. Truman, President Oivic Federation, Cityâ
Dear Bir: In answer to your invitation to
speak at the mass-meeting this evening I re
gret that previous engagements at the City
Hall, to attend to business of finance in con
nection with the tax levy, will prevent my
presence at your meeting.
It would afford me great pleasure to assist
you in any manner to work a reformation in
the municipal affairs of the City, but so far,
whether right or wrong, my efforts have been
futile, generally finding myself in a hopeless
minority.
Considering my position, it would not be
come me to express any opinion as to the mo
tives of my colleagues, but the iast effort of
the combine, including Supervisor Alphonse |
Hirsch, enacted at y esterday's meeting of the j
board, to take the business of estimating the
tax levy out of the hands of the Finance Com
mittee, is not only an insult to the committee,
but is an indication of what the people may
expect In the way of taxes.
Hoping that your efforts in behalf of the in
terest of the City will accomplish much for
good, I remain, most respectJuily yours.
C. L. Taylor.
Mayor Sutro wrote as follows:
San Francisco, Cal., July 28, 1896.
To the Mast-meeting, Mctropolit an, Temp Â«,
San Franciscoâ Fully appeciating and thank
ing you for the honor of being invited to pre
side at to-nignt's meeting, careful considera
tion has brought me to the conclusion that,
as Mayor of the City of San Francisco, there
would be impropriety in my acting as chair- j
man of a meeting of citizens for the purpose of |
discussing criminal charges against member*
of the Board of Supervisors over which, by
virtue of my office, I have to preside.
Those guilty of a crime should be held to
strict account, but the fact must not be over
looked that the briber is a greater criminal
than the bribed. You should alÂ«o condemn in
scathing terms and Dring to justice those cor
porations by whose corrupt use of money
nearly every branch of the Government has
been infected. Respectfully yours,
Adolph Sctro.
A letter was read as coming from a
citizen as follows:
Gentlemen: How Is it you do not include the
solid seven's broker in your tirade? He should
be included, as most of their dirty work has
been done through his office. Very respect
fully yours, A Citizen.
July 28, 1898.
"These men are not approached openly,"
said Mr. Parkins. "They work througn
an agent or broker, a well-known lawyer,
and through him all their peculiar busi
ness is done."
"For fear you may overlook the fact that
the members of the Board of Supervisors
are not all of a kind, that there are honest
men among them." said Mr. Truman.
"I will recall to you the fact that there
are four of them who may be found al
ways voting for those measures designed
for the betterment of the City.
"The honest Supervisors are:
" CharlcH L,. Taylor.
" Joseph I. Diniond.
" Adolph B. Npreckels.
"John K. C. Hobbs.
"You will find these four always on tbe
right side, voting for good measures, vot
ing steadily against the bad."
rienry E. Highton was introduced as
the first speaker and was greeted with
great applause. He covered the short
comings of the Solid Seven in a short and
direct address that repeatedly elicited
applause. "How many of yv>u pay taxes
or an assessment of one-fifth of the value
of your property ?" he said.
"Not one. [Applause.] And yet tbat is
what the great corporations are assessed.
It it a palpable and outrageous injustice
to oiher taxpayers. To favor corporations
in this manner is a violation of the funda
mental principles of our Government.
The remedy is in your hands, my fellow-
I. J. TRUMAN.
citizen*. Through the primaries and nom
inating conventions you bave tbe power
to repudiate the men who betiay trusts
and to place in office honest men. Let the
next election serve as an opportunity to j
choose men who will stand tbe closest
scrutiny and who will be above suspicion."
W. M. Abbott, a young man, an attor
ney, was next introduced.
He said that there were several reasons
why the solid seven Supervisors should be
driven from the high po ition which they
hold. Either the solid seven "put a job
ud on" the people when they fixed the
water rates last February, or else they are
stealing from the people now. The As
sessor's figures in the first place are too
small, he said. The reduction made by
the Supervisors was outrageous. If this
was the days of the vigilantes something
would hove have happened to these men
long ago. [Applause.]
Charles M. Shortridge, editor of the San
Francisco Call, was then introduced and
spoke as follows:
"Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of the
jury [laughter] and ladies of the jury also:
I believe that it is proper for me to say to
you that this reminds me of the meeting
we had here some weeks ago to beat the
funding bill. I call uoon those present on
tbat occasion to remember that I had the
pleasure of saying to them tnat evening
that the nerve of Mr. Huntington is all
right, and I come to you here to-night to
say that he has lost nothing of that quality,
and to say that his servants â not yoursâ
have still something toproht by by stand
ing in with him, and their nerve, too, is
all right.
"l was not expecting to make a speech
here. I believe it was Samuel Shortridge,
my brotherâ known as a spellbinder-
Sam it was who was expected to be here,
but he has been called to the southern
counties on business. So I had to come
here wholly unprepared, as I have my
speech here written out in my pocket
(taking some memoranda from his over
coat pocket), prepared without malice aud
without prejudice.
"I staud here to arraign these servants of
yours and of mine, gentlemen of the jury,
and I want them convicted. I am for the
prosecution, you notice. I have not made
many arguments in court nor speeches to
a jury, but have been called to-night to
take the place of that brother of mine
and will do the best I can.
"I would like to taice up the case of the
Spring Valley Water Company and see
what the figures tell. The assessed value
of its personal property is $1,049,265;
franchise, $2,500,000; real estate, $1,270,970.
The Supervisors deducted $1,000,000 fro"m
its franchise, leaving a total of $3,820,235.
Now here we have the value of the prop
erty of the company according to the
sworn statement of the company before
the Board of Supervisors in February,
1896, when the water rates were fixed.

I 924-930 MARKET STREET.
This placed it at $21,650,000, as against the
$3,820,000 for which it has this year been
assessed.
"Now, talk about nerre, gentlemen of
the jury. [Laughter.] The dividends of the
company for this year amounted to $711,
--000. This is more than 7 per cent per
annum on $10,000,000. You see it makes
all the difference whether the company
wants to assess the people for water or
whether it is trying to escape assessment
itself In the one case its valuation is
$21,650,000. In the other it is $3,820,000.
And at tbat the Supervisors cut the figure
down.
"The assessment of the San Fancisco
Gaslight Company was $422,429 on per
sonal property, $1,883,170 on franchise,
$1,455,180 on real estate. This was re
duced by the Supervisors to a total of $2,
--687,609. The capital stock of the com
pany is $10,000,000, and its actual market
value is $9,000,000,
"Now, here is this great Market-street
Railway Company, which could afford to
be and ougnt to be honest. The highest
ambition in my life, and I believe your
sentiments if you were rich in millions
would be the same, would be to be honest
with the people in the little matter of
taxes. I am speaking, gentlemen of the
jury, to secure the conviction of these un
worthy rascals. The Market-street Rail
way Company's assessment is as follows:
Personal property $1,932,885, franchises
$2,500,000. real estate $1,118,340. A deduc
tion of $500,000 on the franchise was made
by the Supervisors, leaving their aggregate
assessment at $5,1*51,225. Its capital stock
comprises 187,500 shares, worth $41 sOeach
in the market. The value of its property
as developed in the Siebe case is between
$12,000,000 and $18.,000,000.
"Now, centlemen, without attempting
any of those rpellbuiding arguments such
as George A. Knight, General Barnes and
Sam Shortridge indulge in, I want to call
your attention to the fact tbat I published
these same centlemen, as The Call and
its distinguished contemporary, the Ex
aminer, is now doing, and called upon tne
people to repudiate them over a year ago.
And to-night I know them Mid you know
them. They are a miserable set of rascals.
[Shouts of 'Good boy' from the audience.]
That is a regular spellbinder. Instead of
representing you they organised a little
pool of their own for the purpose of doing
your business and selling you out. But
they never divided. They are of that pe
culiar kind of agents who make collections
and return nothing.
"They remind me of a lawyer to whom
i a client sent a bill of $450 for collection.

W. M. HINTON, K istrar of Voters.How ttje ,Mass-Â« Meeting Lashed "The Seven."
WHEREAS, The Market-street Railway Company, the Spring Val
ley Water Company, the San Francisco Gas Company and allied cor
porations have for years defied the laws of the State and the City, have
corrupted officials and have brought disgrace upon the government of
San Francisco; and
WHEREAS, E. L. Wagner, Alfred Morgenstern, Edward Hughes,
Joseph King, Chris Dunker, E. L. Benjamin and P. A. Scully have un
blushingly done the bidding of these corporations and have corruptly
reduced their assessments in the face of the recommendations of the
Grand Jury and the plain dictates of justice ; therefore be it
Resolved, That' we commend the Grand Jury for promptly present
ing these Supervisors for removal from office, and we call upon District
Attorney Barnes to do all in his power to secure a conviction.
' Resolved, That we commend the course of the Examiner, THE
CALL and the Chronicle, and tender them our thanks for their fearless
discharge of their grave public duty of exposing rascality and corruption
in public office.
Resolved, That we congratulate the people of San Francisco on the
possession of such fearless champions of their rights as Mayor Sutro and
the honest minority of the Board of Supervisors.
The bill was paid and then the lawyer, I <
don't think it was Mr. Highton [laughter]
Wrote to his client: 'I have collected that j
bill. Please send me tbe balance of ray ! j
fee,- 1150.' That was a regular spellbinder ]
to the man who Bent the bill.
."Now, we have a spellbinder in these
men, who draw a salary from you, then j I
sell you oat and still demand more.
"I was to a certain extent surprised,
though you will notice that my surprise ]
hÂ»s not entirely overcome me, when asked j
to-address you. I was pleased to be asked,
"because I desire to become acquainted !
with the people of San Francisco.
' We came here not only to impeach but j '
actually to convict. But that is not suffic- '
ient. We must go out of this hall with a
firm resolve that we will do what Mr.
Highton said we ought to do. We ,
must go forward in this municipal tight
and select honest men to represent us.
That is a statement that is too much of a ; (
kindergarten nature to make to you, but !
is it not surprising that we do not do this i ,
âthat men are selected to handle and
manage millions of dollars of the City, j
who would not be selected to manage a
crossroad grocery store?
"The idea of such miserable fellows be- i
ing in power/ac this man King, who, i
when I had the pleasure of showing him
up in my paper, said he was coming
around to lick the editor. He may come
around to-morrow to iick me for what I ,
have said to-night. But I say now that he
is an absolutely unworthy representative
of the great City of San Francisco. [Ap
plause j. i
"But while I occupy tbe editorship of j
that paper I will cay to Mr. King that mj
fighting editor is just around tbe corner!
and is entirely prepared for him and all
the other rascals. For with the other !
good people of San Francisco I pledge my- \
self again and I dedicate myself to tbe j
good and welfare of the people of San
Francisco â the law-abiding, respectable
and decent element of San Francisco j
[applausej and against such miserable vile
frauds. I will march forward with that
solid phalanx of the people. They will be {
swept aside as the chaff before the wind.
"My contempt for them is so supreme '
that if I were not undesirous of being ac- [ ,
cused of being melodramatic, I would say
I would not leant to die in a better cause
than thrashing tbe rascals through the
streets.
"I am heart and soul with yon. and will
have a vote with you. I will attempt to !
voice with you, with other members of tbe '
press, as a country member â as a sort of
hayseed, with the hay still sticking in my
hair â the sentiments against official cor- j
ruption. I have come among them to be â 
one of them, to fight with them and for j
yonâ to fight for purity and honesty in !
public office.
"Let us select men such as I have before '
me now. Suppose you had twelve of this I
number, with a Mayor who nad the power
to veto, nothing could then go wrong. '
Let us select such a Mayor. Let all our I
tickets, no matter to what party we be- j
long, contain the names of men of probity
and ability. The present situation shows
bow necessary it is that the leaders of the
various parties should nominate such |
men from whom the people can select a j
jury that will turn tbe rascals out and '
manage your City with dignity, honesty
and enterprise, with glory to themselves
and this fair City."
"We are not here to mince matters,"
. commenced James H. Barry, amid a tern- ]
pest of applause. "We are here to de- i
nounce a gang of public rascals who have !
proved false to their trust. The preceding
brilliant speaker has said that crimes such .
as these seven men have committed â yea, 'â 
crimes of far less magnitude were pun- â 
ished by hanging in 1856. But we are not
now in the old Vigilante days. Still we i
have ways whereby to punish these and \
otber rascals.
. J'As for good citizens mending matters
by taking part in politics, it is vain to
prate of such a thing. I have been at pri- j
marie* and have seen the way in which j
men vote once, twice, or twenty times un- â 
der as many names as they might choose, j
I have seen a man, young and tough as
many that we see on the downtown curb- !
stones, swear that he was entitled to vote j
in the name of the fattier of a venerable
looting man who challenged his ballot.
"We are come Here to denounce the j
Solid Beven. Mr. Highton has said their j
action, recently exposed, was evidence of j
unjust discrimination. It was more â it
was a damnable fraud. This action was'
taken in view of certain considerations.
la other words, it was paid for with coin. [
ToÂ°what purpose do we pile condemna- â 
tion upon mere tools. The San Francisco !
Gas Company, the Spring Valley Water '
Company and the Market-street Railway
are the powerâ three persons in one false
j, o d â which is at tbe bottom of all the !
trouble. This must be attacked and
downed by true and faithful public ser
vants."
The following letter from Congressman â¢
James G. Maguire was then read:
â  /. J. Truman, Esq., Metropolitan Templeâ Dear j
Sir: Your Invitation to attend and speak at j
the niass-meetinc this evening came duly to |
band. I regret that otber and prior engage- j
menu make it impossible for me to attend.
The ODjeets of the meeting, as I understand :
tnem, are to promote good government by
arousing and concentrating public sentiment
upon the official management of our munici
pal business, and to condemn certain acts of j
favoritism in tbe taxation of wealthy corpora
tions.
J am heartily in accord with your effort to
arouse the public conscience and to make its
voice effective in controlling and directing
public matters. This has always been one of
the great needs of San Francisco. In no other
great city are public officers so heedless of j
public sentiment. The faint rests with the j
people rather than with the officers. The pub- j
lie conscience has been allowed to remain dor- â 
mant. Faithful public servants have been
neglected and vicious ones have been too ,
often rewarded with farther honors and
emoluments.
Let it once be understood that fidelity to
public trusts will be noticed and rewarded by
the people, and that no unfaithfulness in of
fice will escape their condemnation, and im
mediately official conduct will be elevated and
purified. Public sentiment is the only real
force to be relied upon in the making and in
the execution of oar laws. That force, culti
vated and educated, is the measure and sup
port of our civilization.
I am not sufficiently familiar with the. mer
its of the present controversy to judge accur
ately the conduct of our accused Supervisors,
but of this I am certain, they are answerable
to the public, and if their ac is have been just
and fair they should hasten to vindicate them
selves before the public.
Let it never again be truthfully said that
corrupt private interests remember and re
ward the.r friends while the faithful . servants
of the people are forgotten. Very truly yours,
James G. Maguike.
Charles W. Reed, the next speaker,
dwelt upon the good Supervisors and the
Dad ones which San Francisco has had,
seeming to consider the 'latter far in the
majority.
"But now," he went on, "we have a
Board of Supervisors which beats any, on
record. The wards are improperly divided.
The old division lines are still kept up,
leaving the best residence districts of the i
city practically without representation.
"Under the present vicious system Tar '
Flat has three out of the twelve Super
visors, and the Barbary Coast no less than
five. This is the third prosecution of pub
he officials that has taken place daring the
present year. The first two have fallen
through. ' Let us hope Mr. Barnes may
make this last one a second Durrani
trial. The betrayer of women has been
placed where he can do no more harm in
that line for the present. Let us hope a
similar fate . may befall these betrayers of
their country."
H. W. Philbroot dwelt upon the proba- j
bility / that the schemes of the "solid
seven" were paid for. He also contended, j
reading in confirmation of his position
the opening section of thetState constitu- :
tion, that the people . had a right to meet
for the purpose of instructing tneir repre- !
sentatives and â  protesting against abuses.
> "It is true tnat a reform should sweep :
over our City. .We are told that the ma
jority does not rule. The correct, healthy
mind of the majority does not rule, in my
opinion. All it needs is to be waked up.
Its existence is amply proved by the im
mense attendance here to-night. We j
know that the protesting voice of San !
Francisco raised against the funding bill
was heard in Washington. .
"We have our power, and we must use
it rightly. But our judiciary procedure
must be reformed. The Judges have too
much power in the matter of setting aside
verdicts in civil and criminal cases. 1
hone to do my best to this end if ever I j
have the chance."
Joseph Leggett said it was true that we
are no longer in Vigilante times, but be
hoped the times were vigilant, at all
events.
"Haven't you a duty to perform?" he
asked. '.'Democrats, Republicans and
Populist*, you have a sacred charge to
keep. There are many good things beyond
our power; but there, are some that we
can do. . We can at . least watch the men
who are proposed for election as our ser
vants and find out whether they be
worthy."
The Hod. A. W. Thompson spoke on
similar lines, recommending pare political
methods in the administration of the City
government.
Mr. Reed then read the following pre
amble and resolutions, . which were unani
mously adopted by a standing vote:
WHEREAS, The Market-street Kail
way Company, the Spring Valley Water
Company, the San Francisco Gas Com
pany and allied * corporations .' have for
year* defied the laws of the State and
the City, have corrupted ; officials . and
have brought disgrace - upon - the gov
ernment of San Francisco; and
: WHEREAS, Â£. 1.. : Wagner, - Alfred
Morgenctern, Edward Hughes, Joseph
Kins;, Chris Danker, E. L.. Benjamin
and P. A. Scully . have nnblnshingly
done the bidding of these corporations,
and have corruptly reduced their assess
ments in the face of the recommenda
tion* of the Grand Jury and the plain
dictates of Justice; therefore be It 7
RESOLVED, That we commend the
Grand Jury for promptly presenting
these Supervisors for removal from of
fice, and we call upon District Attorney
Barnes to do all in. his power to secure
a conviction.
RESOLVED, That we commend the
course of the Examiner, " The Call"

EESOLVKD, That we congratulate the
people of San Francisco on the posses- â 
sion of such fearless champions of their
right* as Mayor Sutro and the honest
minority of the Board of Supervisors
As the reading ended the vast audience
rose to its feet," and \ cheer upon cheer, re
sounded through the building; the band,
seeming to share in the overwhelming en
thusiasm, sent forth a rapturous * burst of
richest harmony, and thus ended a great
City's solemn and outspoken j protest
against wickedness in high places.

FIVE DISSATISFIED
BANK DEPOSITORS,
Want to Be Members of
the Hibernia Loan
Society.
A COMPLAINT FILED.
The Directors Charged With
General Mismanagement
of Affairs.
SECRETARY TOBIN EXPLAINS.
Ks Says That These Difficulties Were
Settled in Court Many
Years Ago.
Five depositors of the Hibernia Savings
I and Loan Society yesterday appeared be
fore the Bank Commissioners and filed
charges alleging that the directors of the
bank have been guilty of gross misman
! agement in conducting that institution.
I The complainants are: Dr. J. F. Gibbon,
Michael Kane. Bernard Keenan, Michael
Sullivan and John Murphy.
The character of the cnarges does not in
' any way reflect upon the solvency and
1 stability of the bank, which, according to
| the statement of Bank Commissioner Paris
Kilburn, is as firm as a rock and has more
| quick securities than any other institution
j on the coast.
The complaint in twelve counts charges
| the management with giving $50,000 to the
I San Joaquin Valley Railroad and demands
i that the directors pay tbe money back
! into the bank; that money has been
â¢ loaned on real estate over 60 per cent of
i the market value, ana a loan of $30,000 to
> Jacob Heyman and one of $25,000 to P. D.
i Cole are cited ; making large invest
! ments in bank property in excess of tbe
I amount allowed by law; making extrava
; gant charges for effecting loans to the
profit of the managers and at the expense
of the depositors ; also:
Taking passbooks from old members and
giving them new ones, thereby defrauding
them out of tbeir membership and the right to
a portion of the reserve or sinking fund.
Removing the conditions out of members'
, books, thereby cheating them out of their
right to membership (the said conditions being
evidence of membership) and also tbeir right !
to a portion of the sinking fund.
Tbe reserve fund must be divided among
members. No portion of it has ever been paid
I in dividends, a* other savings banks have
j done with it. They decline to make any divi
j dends of the reserve fund, amounting now to
; over two and a half million dollars in c&sn,
which is an unnecessary protection fundâ a
portion of said reserve fund should justly be
paid out to all depositors whose money earned
it. It appears that the managers covet it
when they try to cut off all the old members
by confiscating their bankbooks and tearing
out the conditions, thereby destroying evi
dence of membership, and enabling them to
I divide the reserve fund and bank property
I among themselves at tne expiration of the in
; corporation, thirteen years hence, leaving out
; the real owners whose money earned It.
Besides the foregoing the bank officials
I are charged with drawing double salaries,
niakine exorbitant charges for services,
etc The main complaint is, however,
based upon the inability of tbe complain
ants to secure any part of the reserve or
sinking fund, which they claim they are
entitled to. Tbe object of the complaint
I is to have the Bank Commissioners place
j them on the n-embership roll of the cor-
I poration.
Secretary and Treasurer R. J. Tobin
taugbed when the charges were explained
to him. In speaking of the pretensions
of the depositors to membership he said
that the matter had been settled as to
their standing years ago. Tbe bank was
incorporated in 1859, and from then to
1864 all depositors having over $100 on de
posit were entitled to membership as
shareholders. In 1864 tbe bank incorpor
ated without a capital stock.
All of the old members were invited to
become members of the new, but not
many accepted, as the bank was then a
small affair compared to what it is now.
In 1878 the privilege of becoming members
was withdrawn, and this action resulted
in an action by Patrick Mullen, a depositor,
who wanted to be a member. Judge
Thornton, now Justice Thornton, decided
in favor of the bank about 1887.
Patrick McAran began a similar action
with like results. Thus the matter of
members of the old bank becoming mem
bers of tbe new was finally settled in
court.
Mr. Tobin said that Dr. Gibbon has not
over $6 or $7 in the bank and the other
complainants have not much more to
their credit. "In short," said lie, "these
folks want to get a slice of the bank's re
serve fund, which the courts have decided
they are not entitled to."
In speaking of the donation to the Val
ley Railroad Mr. Tobin said that under
the law the bank managers can dispose of
any surplus over $100,000. This fund now
amounts to $250,000 and the donation
mentioned was perfectly legal. More than
that the purpose of the bank to foster and
encourage just such enterprises the pur
pose of which is for the public's benefit.
By such transactions the bank is build
ine up and strengthening its own securi
ties by keeping up the value of real estate
and fostering local industries. By Just
such transactions money is kept in circu
lation here that otherwise would seek
other fields for investment. Therefore,
Mr. Tobin said the donation was a good
business and politic investment, and cor
rect legally as well.
In discussing the matter of making
loans on real estate close to the market
value Mr. Tobin suggested that It some
times happens that after a loan is made
the market values drop so that there is
not a very wide margin left. It is for just
such cases as these that the bank keeps up
its large reserve fund.
â¢â¢It is with pride that we point to this
reserve fund/ said Mr. Tobin, "for no
matter what happens in the fluctuations
of securities the bank, has plenty of money
on hand to meet all emergencies. Why,
that is the bigeest feather in our cap.
These other charges and complaints are
all bosh and not worthy of a reply. An
examination of our books will convince
any business man that the bank and its
managers are all right."
Bank ,Commissioner Paris Kilburn
stated that tbe Commissioners will file the
complaint away until the regular examin
ation of the banks begins. "The Hibe-nia
Savings and Loan Society is perfectly
solvent," said he, "and tbe charges do not
affect its standing in the least. Its man
agers are all business men and fully in
formed as to the laws regarding banks and
banking.
"It is not likely that they have violated
any law, but we will look into the charges
when we examine the bank's affairs. It is
not a case that requires immediate action.
From what I have been told the main
question was settled by the courts years
â¢go."
REPUBLICANS TO MEET.
The State Central Committee
Will Convene Here Next
Saturday.
Present Campaign Activity Will Be
Further Stimulated at That
Time.
Tbe new Republican State Central Com
mittee will hold its first meeting on next
Saturday at Golden Gate Hall in this City,
beginning at 10 a. m.
This meeting will fairly set the cam
paign going, although the executive
committee, whicn has the details of cam
paign work in hand, has been fully alert
and very active during the weeks since it
was organized with Frank McLaughlin as
its chairman.
There are no matters of especial mo
ment which are now expected to come be
fore the State Central Committee, but the
meeting will have an important and stim
ulating effect on the campaign. This will
probably be more dne to the informal
meetings of the party representatives with
the officer* and members of the executive
committee, wbo are doing the important
campaign work, than to any measures
taken. by the body as a whole.
The attendance from all over the State
promises to be large, according to the cor
resDOiider.ee of Secretary M. R. Higgins,
and at the meeting the individual mem
bers of the committee wiil either make or
cement their friendship with Chairman
McLaughlin, Secretary Higgins, Assistant
Secretary Stepacher and the other most

The members of the State Central Com
mittee representing tbe various Assembly
districts will before, during and after the
meeting acquire a definite understanding
of the important part they should play in
the coming campaign and receive some of
the confidence and enthusiasm which now
fills the members of tbe executive com
mittee who have the present campaign
worK in hand.
The State headquarters in the Palace
Hotel increases its life daily, and daily
does tbe mass of correspondence con
ducted by the chairman, secretary and as
sistants to secretary increase. The first
McKinley and Hobart posters, recently
aescribed in The Call, are being sent out
rapidly to every county in t:e State, and
during the coming week the campaign
literature, which will flood the State, will
begin its outward flew.
The State executive committee has as
yet made no definite arrangements about
campaign speakers, either of the State or
from the East. It is now the general ex
pectation at headquarters that tbe cam
paign will not fully open with its regular
assignments of meetings and tours of
prominent speakers until about Septem
ber 1. A two months' campaign of bon
fire meetings is about as much as any set
of campaign speakers is able to stand, and
this, together with the industrious and
systematic distribution of campaign litera
ture, is about the present measure of an
ticipated campaign activity.
The correspondence of Secretary M. R.
Higgins id daily fruitful of much informa
tion that is encouraging to tbe Republican
managers. Letters daily pour in by the
dozen from every portion of the State,
giving political reports from the sections
from which they come.
E. C. Pendletbn writes from Red Bluff
in behalf of the Republican organization
of ttfat county:
"So far as my observation goes every
thing indicates the success of the Re pub;
lican ticket in Tehama County this fall.
TniÃ county has not always given a RepubJ
lican majority, but I firmly believe it will
do so in November."
F. L. Dodge of Hanford, chairman of the
county committee of Kings County, writes:
"I can assure you tuat the Republican
fight in Kin^s County will be equal to the
emergency. We organized a big Me-
Kinlev arid Hobart club last Friday^night.
The Republican-Populists are disgusted
with the St. Louis convention and are
coming back to their first love. They wiil
vote for McKinley and protection. Kings
County will be all right."
A leading Republican of Siskiyon
County, in the course of a favorable re
port on the party prospects there, writes:
"The Populists and Democrats here have
no love tor each other and they are apt to
constitute tbe kind of a happy family to
be foutm in Barnum's menagerie,"
An Early Morning Blaze.
A blaze in the three-story frame building at
11 Eddy street, rnnning through to lOltf Mar
ket, caused a loss yesterday morning of about
$lt>oo. The building is owned by Mrs. Rlley
And was occupied by A. D. Porter as a saloon.
Tiie upper floor is run as a lodging-house. The
lo.ss on the saloon is about $1000 and on the
lodging-house if 100. The owner of the build
ing thinks $000 will cover the damage to her
property. Captain Comstock of the Fire Pa
trol is of the opinion that the blaze was caused
by the electric wires becoming crossed, thus
sending a current in the wood.

WOOL A VICTIM
OF FREE TRADE.
The Industry Paralyzed
Under the Wilson
Bill.
SHEEP MEN VERY BLUE
Prices Fall More Than 50 Per
Cent in Less Than Two
Years.
THE LOCAL WAREHOUSES CLOSE
Cheap Foreign Wools Crush Out Home
Dealers and Destroy American
Industries.
It is the purpose of this and a succeed
ing article to show in a simple and conclu
sive way, so clearly tnat none can mis
understand the proposition, that when the
Democrats killed the McKinley protective
tariff law and substituted therefor the
Wilson bill they destroyed the wool indus
try of the United States.
It was the immortal Dr. Samuel John
son who said. "The proof of the pudding
is the eating thereof and not the chewing
of tbe strings." It may be said that the
proof of a goT^rnment's policy is the work
ing thereof and not the spinning of the
ories. 6
The policy of the Republicans, as ex
emplified in the McKinley law governing
the wool industry, is the direct opposite of
the policy of the Democrats, as seen in
the present Wilson bill. The McKinley
bill was in effect from October 1,
1890, until August 28, 1894, and since
that time the country has been
struggling under the Democratic policy of
anti-protection. It is the duty of every
citizen to study the results ol the two
policies, each of which had a fair chance,
but, as the tariff lists cover thousands of
articles, it is well to study the more im
portant industries in the order of their
general importance, one by one.
Let it be understood at the outset what
is the exact difference between the Mc-
Kinley bill and the present Democratic
law, as regards the treatment of the wool
growing industry. The customs act of
October 1, 1?^, commonly Known as the
McKinley law, divided wool into classes
one, two and three, and made stringent
provisions against their indiscriminate
importation. Paragraphs 384, 385 and 386
of the law, . under schedule X, pro
vided that wool of the first class pay a
duty of 11 cents a pound, that the second
clats pay 12 cents, and that the third class,
exceeding in value 13 cents a pound, pay
32 per cent ad valorem. On some quali
ties of the third class tbe duties were
, placed at 50 per cent ad valorem. These
are the main outlines of a carefully drawn
law that equally protected flannels, car
pets, blankets, bats and scores of manu
factured products. Throughout every sen
tence of the law, as the most casual read
ing will show, there was great care to pro
tect American products against those of
other countries. On this point there has
never been a dispute, for the provisions of
the lew are as plain as the alphabet.
That law expressed the policy of the
Republican party, as carefully formulated
by such economic students as Allison and
McKinley. It stood for the Republican
theory and practice of protection to Amer
ican labor and American industry, and the
'results of practical workings may be found
in the records of .industrial and commer
cial life for the period extending from Oc
tober 1, 1890, to August 28. 1894, when the
Wilson bill, tne idol of Democracy, super
seded it. What were the provisions of
this bill affecting wool, and what effect
have they had on the sheep and wool in
dustries of the country?
Under paragraph 685 of the Wilson bill
â¢ the following wools arc freed from duty :
"All wool of the sheep, hair of th* camel,
goat, alpaca.and other like animals, and all
hairon<he sKin, noils, yarn, waste, card
waste, bur waste, stubbing waste," etc.
On woolen and worsted yarns, shoddy
and many forms of fabrics that had ample
protection under the McKinley law the
present law provides a small ad valorem
duty, which affords no protection what
ever.
It cannot be said that there is any ob
scurity in the provisions of either law.
The issue between Republican protection
and Democratic free trade is here sharply
defined and every point is clear cut.
It was the contention of McKinley and
tne supporters of his law that the Demo
cratic policy would destroy the wool and
sheep business of the country; that for
eign wools would inundate "the United
States, drive sheep-growers out of business
and result in a general depression of the
pursuits depending on sheep-rais-ing. The
Republicans contended that American
growers and dealers would find no mar
ket for tneir product. On the other hand
the" Democrats held that there would be
an increased demand for the American
output, which would be mixed with the
finer woo) 3 from abroad. How can it be
shown whether this country's purchase of
foreign wools has increased ? How are we
.to know whether there has been an in
creased demand for American wool?
Custom-house reports snow what has
been imported from other conntries, and
reports from market centers, as well as by
etatisticians employed by the Govern
ment, - show tne decadence of the sheep
raising industry on this continent.
â  Omitting unnecessary lists of figures,
and quoting the main points irom reports,
it may be sairt that importations of foreign
wools have increased even beyond the pre
dictions of the friends of protection, while
pbeen-growers who raised wool have be
come little more than mutton-raisers un
â  der less than two years of Democratic rule.
The importations of woolens for the
fiscal year ending June r 3O, 1892, may be
, taken as a fair test of what wa.Â« tht status
of affairs under the McKinley law. Of
class 2, under schedule X, there were
imp0rted 5,826,574 pounds, valued at 51,368
-,-654, and of class 3, 92,581,282 pounds at
$8,795,681.
For the fiscal year endine June 30, 1895,
tinder the Wilson bill, there were imported
as follows: Ciass 1. 82,615,995 pounds at
?12.713.350. being clothing wool free of
duty; al*o 4,535,527 pounds at $622,252;
class 2. free of duty, 13 207.230 pounds at
1 2.564 .427; class 3, free, 95,403,018 pounds
at $8,718,447, and of dutiable goods of the
same class 10,002,631 pounds at a duty of
$864,791. Â°
Tne student of figures will behold in
these incieased importations some of the
effects of the new law, the law which the
Democrats heralded as a panacea for all
industrial ills. Does the table not show
that the Republicans were right in at least
one thingâ in their prediction that for
eign wools would be" imported in large
quantities? Now let us see whether the
increased importations did any damage to
the home industry, or whether there was
a demand for American wool to mix with
the foreign product.
The best summary of the American sit
uation that has been made for a long time
was issued in KoÂ«'on on July 18 by Fenno
Brothers & Chiids, prominent for many
years as commission wool merchants and
close students of the situation. Their cir
cular, iÂ«sued as a cold bu.-inÂ«?ss statement,
is a fulfillment of Republican prophecies.
It is so important that the following quo
tations are submitted as being directly in
point. Among other things it says:
"Business paralysis has succeeded busi
ness inactivity, and, as a result, the vol
ume of trading shows the smallest total of
sales that we have had to note since wool
growing became an important industry in
this country, and Boston the leading wool
market in the United States. When less
than three-quarters of a million pounds of
wool changes hands during a week in a
market which ordinarily disposes of from
150.000,000 to 200,000,000 pounds of wool in
a year, the causes which influence the
situation are too significant to be ignored."
The foregoing statement applied to the
week ending July 18, but there is a wider
survey a little further along. After advis
ing their frienda to pursue a most consei
vative course in their operations until the
future is more assured, the circular con
tinues:
"That we can see any higher prices for
wool in the immediate future does not
seem possible as we view the situation.
The total sales of domestic and foreign
wool since January 1 foot up 64,820,500
pounds against 115,962,000 pounds during
the same time last year, showing a de-,
crease in business of 51,041,500 pounds
compared with last year, and this great
curtailment in the output of wool must of
necessity create a surplus which, even un
der increased activity on the part of mills
later on, can hardly be overtaken during
the balance of the year.
"The movement in the woolen goods
market is still restricted to small limits,
and the present amount of idle machin
ery is likely to be increased in the near fu
ture, and while the reduction in woolen
goods thus brought about may in the long
run nave a favorable effect upon the price of
woolens, this large shutting down of the
factories is not an encouraging siÂ«n as far
as wool is concerned. There~ is just as
much wool to be marketed whether the
mills run or stop, and each month that
tbe demand for it is curtailed makes the
chances for future values more open to
doubt. Importations of woolen goods
still continue, but under the influence of a
decided slackness in demand show a con
siderable falling off in volume as com
pared to a year ago.
"Sales for tbe past week foot up about
730,000 pounds against about 5,700,000
pounds for the corresponding week of last
year, and about 997,000 pounds for the
preceding week of this year. Again the
shrinkage in the volume of business be
tween this year and last is most conspicu
ous and cannot fail to have its significance.
The principal sales have been of territory
about 200,000 pounds, of domestic fleeces
about 200,000 pounds, and of pnlled wool
about 100,000 pounds, and of foreign about
150,000 pounds."
Such has been the general tenor of every
circular issued by commission merchants
who have canvassed the situation during
the year, and auch has been the general
pall over the business ever since the Dem
ocratic free trade-policy has had full sway.
In a circular issued early last spring the
same firm says: "The wool market con
tinues dull and lifeless and the total saleÂ«
of domestic wools show a great falling off
from an average week's business."
The foregoing facts apply to the general
market, but there is plenty of evidence to
show that the local situation is equally
bad, if not worse.
Spearing of the subject yesterday, the
senior member of the well-known San
Francisco firm of Sboobert & Beaie, wool
merchants, said: "I am not an alarmist,
and I do not believe in making a disturb
ance over impending calamities, but the
simple truth is that we cannot compete
with foreign wools, and witnout protec
tion tbÂ« wool business will perish. The
Australians, with free lands and superior
skill, can raise better wool than is pro
duced anywhere in America and at one
fifth what it costs us to produce an inferior
quality. Nearly every scouring mill is
closed and our warehouses are deserted.
There is no market."
Mr. Hulme, of the well-known local firm
of Hulme & Hart, says:
"The clip in this Btate this year falls
17.000 bales short. This amounts to five or
six millions of pounds. Why? Simply
because sheep-erowers are forced to sell
their sheep for mutton, ther*. being no
profits in the business of growing for
wool.
"From three to four years ago Hum
boldt wools brought from 25 to 30 cents a
pound, but to-day, with the competition
of fine foreign wools, they have no buyers
at 11 and 12 cents. In the old days the
banks loaned money freely on wool, which
was as good as old wheat in the raill, but
to-day they will not make advances at all,
because wool won't bring even the lowest
prices, and half the men in the sheep
business are closed out. The Nevada
wools are affected less than others, but
even these feel sadly the effects of free
trade."
Thus it is plain to be seen that there is
business paralysis in the local market as
well as all over tbe Union. The most con
servative reports show that half the ma
chinery in the woolen manufacturing
regions is idle. The experience of two
years has shown that the American manu
facturer cannot successfully compete with
the foreigner, who. in his efforts to hold
American trade under free trade, is offer
ing his products at continually decreasing
puces.
The following report from Hulme &
Hart's Prices Current for the week ending
July 25 shows the stagnant condition of
the market: "Receipts California sprine
clip aggregate 38,219 bags, against 55,964
bags same time last year. For the week
receipts California have been 331 bags
against 793 bags last week and 954 bags in
the corresponding week last year. Oregon
receipts for the week are 441 bags against
268 "bags in the corresponding week last
year.
"An exceedingly quiet market has been
experienced the past week, with business
almost at a complete standstill. Values
cannot be said to show any quotable
change, desirable qualities not being ob
tainable for any less than figures lately
current, bat buyers are as a rule tempo
rarily out of the market."
Any one who goes on the Wool Ex
change and talks with dealers irrespective
of his political beliefs will soon be con
vinced that there, is no division of senti
ment as to the proper policy for the fos
tering of the wool industry of the United
States. , All want protection, and all real
ize that the present Democratic free-trade
policy as formulated in the Wilson bill is
responsible for ' the paralysis of business
that marks the country , to-day, as it has
thrown Â» pall over industry since the Wil
son bill became a law_J
UNDER CIVIL SERVICE
Ia the Place Made Vacant by the
Death of Captain Tal
bot.
There have been more than fifty appli
cations for tbe position of Inspector of
Hulls and Boilers, made vacant by the
death of Captain Talbot. Collector Wise
Surveyor English and Supervising In
spector Berniingham have been besieged
with place-hunters who sought to * am the
coveted position through their influence.
The recent civii service law now steps in
and relieves these gentlemen of possible
political embarrassment. Supervising In
spector Birmingham was iniormed yester
day by the department at Washington
that as soon as practicable an examina
tion would be ordered for tbe purpose of
selectine a man to assume the duties of
the late Captain Talbot. Civil service rules,
of course, narrow the race down to a few.
Under ordinary conditions Captain D
Marcucci would be right in line for pro
motion, but it appears that he is lacking
in certain qualifications, which will pre
vent his becoming a competitor even un
aer civil service rules.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JULY 29, 189(5,
JAMES G. BLAINE
REPUBLICANS,
A Great Club Organized
for the Best Party
Principles.
DETERMINED TO WIN.
President Desmond's Noble Ex
pedition to Rescue Political
Prisoners.
WAS FORMERLY SHERIFF HERE
Some of the Influential Men Who
Will Participate in the
Club's Counsels.
No more patriotic or appropriate name
could be given a Republican Club than
that of "James G. Blaiue," and when the
Republicans who make the Knights of tbe
OFFICFRS OF THE JAMES G. BLAINE REPUBLICAN CLUB.
Red Branch Hall on Mason street their
headquarters selected this name as their
standard they undoubtedly struck a sym
pathetic chord in tne hearts of every
American.
Having those grand views as an object
worthy of the cause of Republicanism and
an honor to the men who 1 aye selected
this name for their club, they have made
no mistake as to tne significance of the
cause they have espoused.
The organizers of-the James G. Blame
Republican Cluo never do things by
halves. W r hen tney make up their minds
to accomplish a purpose, they generally
succeed.
Though modest and somewhat secluded
from the common political brawlers who
shout without accomplishing anything
save making a noise, thoÂ«e men go to
work with a determination to win.
No better example can be produced to
establish this fact than the act of the
president of the James G. Blame Club.
Jn 1875 he and John J. breslin sailed
out of the harbor of San Francisco on
board the Catalpa with Captain Anthony
in charge, bound for Western Australia, to
there beard the British lion, supported
by English cannons and fleet men-of-war.
The Catalpa was bound to rescue six po
litical prisoners who were serving a life
sentence at the Fremantle prison for the
Heinous offense of saying that the British
monarchy had outlived its usefulness and
that a republican form of government
was tbe only thing that commanded the
universal admiration of civilized people.
To liberate those men at the risk of his
own life was the mission of Thomas Des
mond, now president of tbe Blame Club,
and iiow well he carried out his intentions
was proven when in 1876 he arrived in an
Eastern port bringing with him his six
liberated countrymen.
For thw brave act Desmond's admiring
friends nominated him in 1879 for the
hi^h office of Sheriff of the City and
County of San Francisco.
His> popularity and genial nature se- I
cured for nim an overwhelming majority !
against his opponent, and, as tlie records
will fuily substantiate, no man ever filled
the office of Sheriff with more credit to
his constituents and honor to himself. His
career disappointed a good many who at
that time were prejudiced against the i
Workingmen's party, which had elevated
him to office, and, unlite the majority of
greedy and unscrupulous office-holders,
Desmond left the office a poorer man than
when he entered it.
Althouen â¢â¢Tom" Desmond, as his
friends love to call him, had received his
nomination from the Workingmen's party,
yet he was a stanch Republican and never
affiliated with any other party.
By his sincerity and devotion to the
principles of the Republican party he has
made hundreds of converts from the ranks
of the Democratic party, who, until the
principles of Republicanism had been ex
plained to them by one in whom t >ey had
the utmost confidence, had adhered to the
false doctrine of a Southern slavery.
There can be no such word as "fail' 1 for
a club with a president like Desmond and
assisted by executive officers of such
caliber as George W. Reid, a well-known
merchant in this City for tbe past tbirtv
years; John T. Tynan. M. Casey, William
J. Hudson, W. F. Coleman, M.'Hart, and
the other gentlemen who compose the offi
cers of the club, who are: Vice-president,
M. Casey; financial secretary, John M.
Donohoe; recording secretary, John Kili
mead; treasurer, M. Hart; se-geant-at
arms, Thomas Degnan; assistant, 8. J.
McCredie; executive committeeâ W. J.
Hudson, W. F. Coleman, R. Corbett, E.
Cunningham, J. Rice, Thomas Barkley, J.
Murphy, J. p. O'Connor, M. McCormick.
The resolutions adopted at a recent
meeting of the club fully explain sen
timents in supporting not only William
McKinJev, but the entire Republican
ticket, they read:
Ruol"td, That we, the nnde rsigned members
of the James G. Blame Republican Club, do
wn y P led Ãe our support to the nominees of
the Republican party, Mr. McKinley and Mr.
uobart, respectively; and be it further
b kw df That w Â« respectfully request the
republican municipal convention 10 nomi
nate men well known to the community and
of sterling integrity, and that said nominees
be selected from the different classes that go
to make up the Republican party, as we deem
tnis course essential for the success of the
ticket; and be it further
Resolved, That we do hereby approve of the
leadership of J. D. Spreckels.
There are 180 names on the roll, al
though the club has only been m exist
ence ten days, and it is anticipated by the
officers tnat fully 1000 names will be added
before the day of election, making it one
of the most powerful and influential or
ganizations in the City.
President Desmond will at the next meet
ing of the club appoint a campaign com
mittee which will be empowered to secure
Metropohtian Temple or some other suita
ble hail where mass-meetings may be held
and able speakers address the meetings.
The officers and members of the James
G. Blame Club recognizing that without
discipline and an acknowledged head and
hand to direct the management of local
politics in this City the party would go to
pieces and defeat would be doubly assured.
W ith the knowledge and value of having a
man of recognized ability, with a pure and
clean record to volunteer his service in the
interest of the Republican party without
expecting any reward other than that of
serving the City and the people of whom
he is one in the truest sense of that appel
lation, they have unanimously indorsed
John D. Spreckles as the one most fitted
to be entrusted with the management of
the party in this City and to him they will
look for counsel and advice in the coming
campaign.

HIGHBINDER TONGS
EMULATE TIE OWL
Sergeant Price's Posse Ousts
Them From Cellar
and Attic.
LAW FIRMS INTERFERE
Societies for Which Immunity
Is Demanded the Worst
in Chinatown.
HEATHEN HEARTS ARE HEAVY
The Police State That Lawlessness
Will Be Suppressed, Displease
Whom it May.
The heart of the wily heathen is sad,
and as far as is consistent with the digni
fied mien of injured innocence his coun
tenance wears a look of intense pain.
There are other parts of him that have a
pained feeling, too, tbe result of sundry
kicks and cuffs received from Sergeant
Price and his squad. Certainly the lines
of life of the various Chinese tongs have
fallen in tborny places.
The police have determined to make the
business of wielding the hatchet soonerous
for the almond-eyed gentlemen whose
headquarters are in various richly fur
nished apartments in Chinatown that
they will conclude to bury the weapon of
offense and take to an honest way of liv
ing for a change.
So far they have been successful. The
crusade of Monday was a fine starter.
Then nil the tones were visited, josses
knocked from their thrones to lie in hu
mility on the floor, and the burning punks
and sandaiwood extinguished with a liba
tion of the most costly Oolone tea.
In departing from their meeting places
the highbinders stood not on the order of
their going but went at once. They were
frequently accompanied to the foot of the
stairways by such inanimate objects as
chairs, tables and gayly colored slippers.
These latter frequently won the race to the
doors which led into the street.
Yesterday Sergeant Price and bis squad
of six men wandered round the Chinese
quarter seeking societies in session. Sev
eral places were raided, hut not nearly so
many as the day previously. The high
binders in general were not yearning for a
repetition of tbe scenes which had so thor
oughly disgraced them in the eyes of their
countrymen.
Now and then some friendly Chinese
would come to one of the squad and tell
him that a band of bloodthirsty coolies
had congregated in some dark cellar or
high attic for the purpose of concoctine
some devilish scheme or other, and a raid
would immediately be made upon that
place.
Out of the cellars would come the mem
bers of the bloodthirsty tongs in single
file, every man having a lead keeping it to
tbe best of his advantage. As they rushed
along the streets to places of safety t. c
wind whistled musically through their
swishing queues, but the sound was lost in
the frightened ejaculations of the wearer.
Sergeant Price says he is much bothered
by the emissaries of certain law firms in
town, who frequently stop him and his
men in the streets and threaten them with
suits for damages and arrest for battery.
"We have been placed here to suppress
the lawlessness that has resulted in mur
der and blackmail," said tne sergeant yes
terday, "and we mean to do our duty.
"We are not going to be deterred by
threats or anything else. The sentiment
of the community is with us in tdis en
deavor to make it safe to pass along the
streets of certain quarters, and no men
hired to protect these bloodthirsty rascals
can prevent us from doing so.
"The particular societies we have been
ordered to let alone on the ground that
they are benevolent orders are, in many
cases, the very worst ones in Chinatown."
A RETURN MATCH.
â 1
Captain Gill Is Negotiating for a Second
Contest With the Portland
' Athletes.
The chances of seeing the. Multnomah
athletic team perform in this City in Sep
tember or October are good.
Yesterday Leonard Gill, the captain of
the Olympic Club, received a telegram
from tbe secretary of the Multnomah Ath
letic Club which stated that the request of
Gill that the northern athletes visit this
City in Septemher, will be discussed at tbe
next meeting of the club and if the matter
is given favorable consideration the lovers
of good athletics will have an opportunity
of seeing Tallent, the great miler, measure
strides with Dave Brown of the Stanford
University, and Kerrigan, the wonderful
little jumper, clear sticks against Patter
son ot the Olympic Club.
It is said that the atbletes of the Mult
nomah Club, who anticipated something
of this sort in the way of a return
match, have been taking ligbt exercise
since the meeting which .was held in
Portland last month, and that unless the
atbletes of the Olympic Club are up
and doing the chances for a second victory
are favorable to the athletes of the north
ern club.
Gul says, however, that he can muster
a strong team and that Brown and Patter
son will certainly turn the tables on Tal
lent and Kerrigan, but then there is noth
ing certain in athletics and the Olympic
boys should not be too continent.

HIS OWN LIFE,
Coroner's Jury Declares It
a Case of Sui
cide.
TEMPORARY INSANITY .
Charles Hug Says His Friend
Was Greatly Perturbed
All Evening.
HOW HE WAS GOING HOME.
Miss Head Described the Manner in
Which Stetson Fired the
Shot
The death of Albert L. Stetson was
officially inquired into by the Coroner
vÂ«stÂ«rday. Charles Hup, the bosom friend
of the deceased, told of his visit to the
.Â». I Miss Head Illustrates the Manner in Which Sietson Shot Himself.
Orpbeum with Stetson on the night of the
tragedy, Mrs. Summervale told of her
visit to the same resort with Miss Amy
Hfed, and the latter recounted the grew
some details of the fatal occurrence up to
the very moment when the youne man
of tjie wo/ld placed a revolver to his head
and remarking, "This is the way I will
go home," sent a ball crashing through
his brain. Other witnesses of minor im
portance* told their stories and then a jury
of seven citizens retired to consider the
testimony. It was a conservative jury.
This the-jurors ?howed all through the in
quest by their cautious questioning, but
the testimony adduced all tended to one
result, tfnd after a deliberation of a little
over o half an hour a unanimous verdict
was reached, as follows: â¢
We find that Albert L. Stetson, aged thirty
years; nativity, California; occupation, rail
road manager; single; residence, 1801 Van
Xess avenue, City and County of Han Fran
cisco", came to his death July "24, 1896, at 235
Post street, said City and county, from cere
bral hemorrhage from gunshot wound of skull,
and we further nod that aald gunshot wound
was self-inflicted during temporary aberration
of hie mind.
Dr.Â° P. J.Â° H. Farrell was the first witness
exanjined. He was the physician called
to attend Stetson immediately after the
shooting. He testified that when he ar
rived the man was already unconscious,
and although he gave him immediate at
tention tbe injured man died In about
two hour* after'his arrival. He was un
conscious from the time the doctor first
Â«aw him. Dr. Farrell stated that he saw
blood on one of Miss Head's hands after
he had been there some time. There was
only a little coagulated blood about her
finger-nail?, indicating that her bands had
been washed since the blood got upon
them.
Coroner Hawkins asked the witness it he
did not remember his calling at the scene
of tbe killing on the morning of tbe occur
ence. The uhysician said be did. "Was
not Miss Head in the house at that time?"
asked the Coroner.
Dr. Farreli Â»aid she was, but explained
that he told the Coroner sbÂ« was not as he
did not think she ought to be disturbed.
Charles Hug told of his meeting with
Stetson early on tne evening of the latter s
death. He met Btetson about 5 o'clock
and after having dinner Hug, Stetson and
P. 8. Samuels went to the Orpbeum. Stet
son Beemea very nervous.
After they had been in the theater about
half an hour Stetson called Hug's atten
tion to Miss Head and Mrs. Summervale
in a box. Soon afterward he left Hug and
Samuels and joined them. That was the
last he saw of Stetson until after the show,
when they met in the Columbia Cafe. He
accompanied Mrs. Summervale home,
walking part of the way with Stetson and
Miss Head. He seid he saw no signs of
Btotaon having been drinking heavily. He
then recounted the incidents of Miss
Head's summoning him about 1 o'clock to
Webster's room, where she said Stetson
had killed himself. When he arrived at
tbe rooms Stetson wan unconscious. He
immediately called Drs. Farrell, Terrill
and Morse.
Pr. George M, Terrill was called, but
threw no light upon the case, as Stetson
was dead when he arrived. In answer to
a question of Juror Blank the doctor
said from his examination of the wound
he did not see how it could hare been in
flicted by any one but the man himself.
He said Stetson was suffering from an af
fection of the liver, which was at times
very painful and would be apt to result in
a depression of spirits.
Frederick R. Webster, in whose rooms
the tragedy occurred, appeared as a wit
ness, though he knew little of the affair.
He said he had just arrived in San Fran
cisco Saturday, and had no personal
knowledge of the killing. He had known
btetson slightly and knew he was a friend
of Miss Head. In answer to a juror's
question he stated that Stetson had not
the entry to his rooms, though MisÂ« Head
had. He, however, would not have coun
tenanced her taking any gentleman to the
rooms.
Mrs. Summervale described the visit
i made by Stetson to the box which she and
| Miss Head were occupying at the Or
j pheum. '-After he left," she said. "Miss
Head said, 'Look what I haye.' I looked
and saw she had a pistol. I was very
much frightened. After he left she said
he baa invited us to the Columbia Cafe.
We went there and Miss Head laid the
i pistol on the table. Stetson started to
! take it and 1 said, 'I have been annoyed
j by that pistol all evening. Either put it
up or take out whai is in it or I will leave.'
I stepped to the door and I heard a click,
click, click. "When I looked around I saw
the cartridges on the table. Stetson said
he had been drinking absinthe for a
week."
Frederick S. Samuels corroborated the
story told by Hug of the visit to the
Orpheum.
Grove P. Ayers testified to having gone
to the room where Steison lay dead. In
answer to a question be said he knew of
no financial reason why Stetson should
take his life, as he could have had all the
money he needed and his affairs were all
straight.
J. M. Quay, the first man whom Miss
Head notified of the shooting and who re
fused to go to the roorj, explained that
when Miss Head knocked at his door and
said Stetson was dead he concluded it w^s
no place for him to be. He gave her some
advice and "then," he f saiÂ«l, "I lonced my
door and went to bed.'' Quay's room is
immediately beneath that where Stetson
died, but the witness said he heard no
shot.
Armstead Smith, a very dignified colored
gentleman who is janitor of the building
where the affair occurred, had a very de
fective memory and could remember noth
ing material.
Miss Amy Head, in whose presence the
Bhootine was done, was next called. She
told of the visit with Mrs. Summervale to
the Orpheum and Stetson's visit to the
box. "I noticed he was looking bad," nhe
said, "and I said, 'How are you feeling,
Al?' He said, 'Bad; too much booze; too
much liquor. 1 As he turned around 1 faw
a pistol in his hip pocket. 1 induced him
to let me take it, as he was in no condition
to have such a weapon. I then placed it
in my lap, with my programme over it"
The visit to tbe Columbia Cafe was then
described. Here she persuaded Stetson to
remove four cartridges from the revolver.
I She asked nim if it was a ri\e-Bbooter. but
I he evaded the question. The visit to Web
ster'H rooms was next recounted. "I told
I Mr. Stetson I would have to go up to Mr.
Webster's room and get a dog," she eaid.
"Then he was going to take me home in a
coupe, as I live near him. Mr. Stetson
followed me into the room, and admired
the furniture.
"I said, 'This is not poing home. Come
on.' He said, 'This is the way I will co
home, Amy.' He placed the revolver at
i his head, I heard a report and saw him
fa!). I looked on my hand and saw blood.
I rushed down to see Quay. He refused
to go up to the room. Then I went for
Hug."
Dr. J. S. Barrett, autopsy physician, de
scribed tbe wound and the physical condi
tion of the body. L. 8. Berry, a hackman,
corroborated Miss Head's story of her
drive to Hug's residence.
The case was then given to the jury,
which consisted of C. A. Blank, foreman;
E. R. Tearce, John W. Wende, E. 0.
Janssen, John Henn, William J. Parrer,
S. H. Daniel and E. H. Rix. Their verdict
of suicide was approved by the Coroner.
Held to Answer.
W. Isham, a gripftian on the Hyde-street
cars, was yesterday held by Judge Conlan to
answer before the Superior Court, in $500
I bonds, on the charge of assault witb a deadly
I weapon. About three weeks ago Isham fired
several shots at E. C. Piuine, his brother-in
law, at Jones and O'Farrell streets, one bullet
taking effect in Plume's leg.

against the Southern Pacific Company,
based on excessive freights and fares on
what is called the west side branch of .the
Southern Pacific Railroad, and . .which
extends from Tracy to Fresno, with a
short spur from Collis to Armona.
Particular cause of complaint lies in the
passenger fare charges, which in no case
are less than 5 cents per mile, and between
some stations are as high as 6 cents per
mile.

part of the Southern Pacific Company which, I
think, properly comes within your jurisdiction
ana authority. ' - -
1 have reference to the freights and fares
(principally fares) imposed by: the Southern
'aciiic Company on what is known as the ban
Pablo and Tulare extension.
The regular passenger rate charged on this
line, which Is called a "branch," Is 5 cents per
mile. All trains, by the way, running on this
line are through trains with one exception.
If this matter should be presented prot>erly
by petition in order to receive your official
attention, please let me know and, if by ordi
nary complaint under oath by one individual,
please let me know, generally, the matter
necessary to be alleged in such complaint.
1 have tried for four years to get this matter
taken up by the papers in hones that some
action would be taken. I have also applied to
Governor Budd, and am referred to you, but
am totally ignorant of the proper method of
procedure. Therefor* I ask to intrude myself >
upon your good nature with the above request. i
Hoping for an early reply I am yours, very
respectfully, C. F. Bertholf.
Inquiry at the passenger department of
the Southern Pacific showed. that Berth- j
oil's complaint was well founded, so far as
the rate per mile on this "branch" beinsr 5
cents. The following table shows the dis
tance between all the points on the Tracy-
Fresno brand) and the fare charged. The
figures opposite each town show the dis
tance and fare from the preceding town, j

It was further stated at the Southern
Pacific headquarters that there are other
branches on'which the 5-cent rate was
charged, and this was due to the small
volume of business (Obtained along them.
On the particular line tinder attention the
through rate from Tracy to Fresno is
based on the 3-cent rate, and only local
traffic between the poi..ts specified "in the
foregoing tables was tubjected to the
hieher rate.
When asked why this particular section
was selected for the imposition of the s
cent rate one of the officials stated the
position of the company as follows:
"Why is it the >*ew York Central can
afford to handle business at a less rate
from New York to Buffalo than it can be
handled by t!ie roads running westward
out of Chicago? Simpiy because the ter
ritory between New York and Buffalo is
practically one continuous well populated
settlement. It is the same on the Penn
sylvania road. Those old communities
are all built ut> and the local business is
something tremendous.
"As you work West the settlements are
not quite so thick through Ohio, Indiana
or Illinois, but when you Ret west of
Chicago through lowa, Nebraska and Wy
oming the settlements are even more
sparse. It is the same in California. Take
down the coast division. We have got
stations every few miles, and our rates are
very low between San Francisco and San
Jose, a distance of fifty niiles.lor which we
charge $1 25 or 2% cents per mile, and bo
between other points, many of the rates
being less than they are outside of Chi
cago.
"Our Jocaljrates and our commutation
rates particularly, are less out of San
Francisco than they are out of Chicago.
TCe Illinois Central, with its big suburban
traffic, charges 3 cents a mile for subur
ban hauls. Our rates in the valleys here
and along our old settled lines down the
coast division, with the exception
mentioned, are 3 cents a mile, ihe same as
Illinois, Ohio, lowa and all the thickly
populated cities of the East.
"We go to work and build a new line
down the west side where there is virtually
no local business. Now we cannot afford
to run trains down there where we have
practically no business as cheaply as
where we have a considerable business. It
is just the same as selling wholesale and
retail. You can afford to sell more cheaply
in large quantities than in small."
As the Railroad Commissioners left for
San Drego yesterday to investigate the
complaint of the citizens of that city
against the California Southern Railway
in connection with the Temecnla Canyon
washed-out road, no action can be taken
in tbis connection until their return.
It is not probable that any attempt will
even then be made to go into the matter,
as the Commissioners consider their hands
completely tied by the temporary injunc
tion granted by Circuit Judge McKenna.
They will not feel themselves privileged
to take any action in regulating freights
and fares until Judge McKenna renders
his decision in the case of the Southern
Pacific Company against the Railroad
Commission, and it U known that the
Judge has not even begun the task of re
viewing the eviasnee and arguments in
that case much less the writing of the de
cision.
MAHER AND CHOYNSKI.
The Irishman I* Afraid to Meet The
Latter in This City.
Maher and his manager, Connelly, held
a conference yesterday with Joe Choynski
who had just returned from Howell moun
tains, at which place he has been rusticat
ing for some weeks.
Connelly was the spokesman. He stated
to Choynski that his ultimatum was $6000
or nothing.
"Peter and I," said Connelly, "came out
here under conditions that Maher would
box Choynski ten rounds and that the
winner was to get the full amount of the
purse offered.
"We found on our arrival that the Na
tional Club could not pull off the contest,
because the Supervisors refused it a per
mit, and here we have been waiting and
waiting, in the hope that some of the
clubs which had been granted a license
would give a purse of the same amount as
the National Club. During our stay in
this City I have received disnarches from
my partner that one of the clubb of New
York would tuve $6000 for a meeting be
tween Choynski and Maher, and under
the circumstances I think we would be
foolish to accept a lesser sum to box in
this City."
Choynski agreed that Connolly was
right in one particular, but he added that
a bird in the band was worth two in the
bush, and emphatically stated that if
Maher had the remotest idea of meeting
him he must fight in this City for a purse
of $4500, and that a return fight could be
pulleo off in New YorJt City.
Connolly failed to see the point, and
said that If a return match took place in
New York City the sports would not give
anything like $6000 for the mill.
Choynski smiled and said that if there
should be such a big demand for fighters
as Connelly predicted tne New York
sports would certainly give $6000 or more
for a return match. Maher entered a big
"kick" and said that he was disgusted
with the way in which the Calif ornians
treated him and would take his departure
for New York right away.
The general opinion is that the Irish
man is afraid to meet the native son in
this City and is therefore anxious to get
back to New York.
DINED IN THE WARDROOM

tertain the New Major-
General.
The Table Was Laid en Board the

IN THE REALM OF LABOR
Garment-Makers Will Use livery .Ef
fort to Abolish the Sweat-
Shop System.
At the regular meeting of the Garment
makers last night a communication was re
ceived from Labor Commissioner Fitzgerald
relating to the system of sweatshops now in
vopue in this City. It was decided to give Mr.
Fitzgerald all the assistance that an organized
body of men are capable of in breaking up this
system. The association will endeavor to find
all proprietors of such shops snd push the
matter br far Â»s it is possible according to the
Ihw. Last night's was the largest meeting that
has ever becu held by this organization.
Next week tne mriiiiure-workers will ap
point two delegates to atend the woodwork
ers' convention, which will be held at Detroit,
MlctL, on October 5.
TheCen'ral Committee of the Socialist Labor
party section of San Francisco discussed last
night district organization and the action to
be taken at the municipal convention, to be
held uext Sunday at ihb Temple, 115 Turk
street.
The Journeymen Barbers' International
Union of America, local union No. 27, at their
regular meeting laft night discussed the ques
tion of early closing and what -measures
should be taken to gain this end. They also
denounced the five-cent barber-shops around'
town as being detrimental to the legitimate
trade, and condemned the barbers' college,
which they said floods the City with inexperi
enced barbers. It was renorted that the union
was steadily increasing in membership.
DELINQUENT TAXES.
The Auditor's Report to the State Con
troller fur the Year 1895 Was
finished Yesterday.
The Auditor's annual report to the State
Controller of the delinquent taxes for the year
1803 was ft., shed yesurday and sent to the
Stale capital. It shows that the value of the
resl phtate on which tajce* are delinquent is
.*1,54G,102. while the personal property on
which taxes huve not been paid amounts to
f2.700.604.
The State* portion of the delinquent taxes
on real estate amounts to $12,045 82, while
$19,115 64 is due it on the unpaid personal
property tax.
lii-jUM-iinu the Heads.
As the result of an inspection male outside
the Heads on baturday last, by Federal officers
and Congressmen, additional safeguards to the
harbor entrance will be asked of the next Con
gress. Captain Sears of the United States sur
vey steamer McArihur invited Congressman
Loud, Senator Per Kins. Captain \\. L. Merry
Captain Rogers of the Geodetic Survey and
others to take the trip and see for themselves
the improvements needed. The party in
cpeeted the buoys on the newly discovered
rock on the north of the channel and also at
Mile Rock. !t was found that the bell at the
latter point did not operate, because of the
lightness of the swH 1 , It was agreed unani
mously that mm ctru- bell acd iights were
an ab6oluie urct* ny lor Mile Rock, and a
recommendation to thai end win be made
There is a probability that the new rock on the
north side of the channel will be removed
soon.
The Church Goes Free.
The Supreme Court has affirmed the judg
ment of the lower tribunal in the case of
Thompson & Williams against Grace Metho
dist EDiscopal Church to recover $425 25 for
street work done in the vicinity of the church.
The work was held to be improperly done by
the Supervisors, and because of that fact the
church refused to pay the contractors for their
labor. In the lower court the contractors con
tended that they had fulfilled their contract
and demanded judgment accordingly. The
court found, however, that the church'had not
made a legal contract with the workmen, and
this, with the fact that the work had not been
ace -p ted, was taken as sufficient ground for a
verdict in the Cdurch's favor.
The Durrant Appeal.
As previously announced iv The Cau, the
bill of exceptions In the case of The People

Court to-day. The transcript ig the largest

FRIENDS FAILED
TO RECOGNIZE HER.
Mrs. Hadix So Changed in ApÂ«
pearancs That She Hard'.y
Knew Herself.
She Says the Secret of the Great Change
and Her Present Good Health Is
Due to the Use of Dr. Williams'
Pink Pillsâ '-Ihi-r Prominent
Citizens Testify to the Merits
of This Remedy.
"You don't know me! Well, I am not sur
prised at that. I hardly know myself, and yet
nere lam full of life and vigor. Look at mv i
arms, round, strong and healthy. The color of j
my cheeks show life and animation."
So spoke Mrs. HRdix, wife of Rev. E. Hadix
oi Placervilie, Cal., and "what has produced
this wonderful chan.pe from almost death to
healthful, active life?"
"Well,! will tell yon. it was Pink Pills for
Pale People. You will remember that for
years I walked the streets a living skeletonâ
emaciatedâ weak and a complete wreck. My
flesh colorless, my nerves unstrung. I had no
blocd. If my flesh was punctured a thin pink
stain was all that could be produced. My
physicians ?aid there was no hope for me. My
friends despaired of my recovery. I was nent
to Sacramento, where three of the niostemi
u-'iit phvs'cians d'.agnozed my case, but they
shook their heads and ?ald they could not
help me, and they refused to take my money,
as they Ooold do me no good.
"My'husbind was sent for to say the last
footi-Dy. When I lay on my couch to reÂ«t
felt as though I wus sinking, down, down,
down. I could not sleep, neither could I
rest. When all hope from physicians was
gone I determined to try what virtue there
was in Pink Pills for Pale People. I com
menced taking them and soon began to im
prove. I continued their use with the
result that to-day I am fully recovered to
health and happiness, and this in less than six
month" from the time f commenced their use.
All hail to Pink Pills for Pale People.'
J. C. Stephens, another resident of Placer
vilie, said: ''I was afflicted with rheumatism
for more than twenty years, and only with the
greatest difficulty was I able to walk to my
place of business. My hands were so stiff and
swollen that I could scarcely hold anything in
them. When driving my team I could not
hold my whip. I saw in the San Francisco
Call that a friend of mine had been cared of
rheumatism by usinc Pink Pills. I commenced
using them, with the result that I am com
pletely cured."
Mrs. J. G. Bailey was afflicted for a long
time with kidney trouble and could not rest
nights. She s.tltl : "I had heurd so much
about the wonders that Pink Pills performed
that I concluded to try them. I commenced
taking them, and found immediate relief,
sleep nicely, and in every way am greatly im
proved."
I W. V. Fairchild is a druggist doing business
in Placervilie. He says he has been selling
Pink Pills for Pale People for several years
and that his customers bpeak very' highly of
them, and s-ales have been more than doubled
within the last six months, especially since
the wonderful recovery of Mrs. Hadix, whose
case was considered hopeless, ana whose re
covery by the use of pink pills was considered
a'most a miracle- The reputation of these
pills Is fully established for doing what they
promise.
Dr. Williams' Pink Pills contain, in a con
densed form, all the elements necessary to
give new life and richness to the blood and
restore shattered nerves. They are an unfail
ing Â»peoiflc for such diseases as locomo'or
aiaxia, partial paralysis, St. Vnus' dance,
sciatica, neuralgia, rheumatism, nervous head
ache, the after-effect of la grippe, palpitation
of the heart, pale and sallow complexions, all
forms of weakness, either in male or female.
Pink Pills are sold by all dealers, or will be
aÂ«nt postpaid on receipt of price, 50 cents a
tox, or six boxes for $2 50, by addressing Dr.
'V.lilams Medicine Company, Schenectady.

on July 30. At these sessions dealers who are
members may present and display samples of any
class of fruit or produce they may have for sale.
â  Memoranda of green fruit or produce con
signments to arrive may also be given to the
secretary and will be posted on the bulletin for the
Information of buyers. The trado generally, not

CHICAUO MARKETS. . ..
CHICAGO, It,i., July 28 Local scalpers were
about the only traders who displayed any energy
in the wheat market to-day, and even they were
less active than usual. The outside refused to be
tempted, and shows no disposition to take hold.
On bearish foreign advices and . good weather in
harvesting sections longs were Induced to sell at
the start, and prices started with a loss from yes
day. Receipts were good, 221 cars arriving at
Chicago and* 379 in the Northwest. -
The latter section had 410 cars last Tuesday and
388 on the corresponding day a year ago. ' Local
inspections from store were 48,900 bushels, and
284,887 bushels cleared at the seaboard Liverpool
cables were easy ana 1/411 lower. Weakness con
tinned to prevail throughout the session, while
business showed no evidence of improvement.
Closing continental cables were Irregular. The
close was the weakest period of the session, inside
quotations being then established. September
wheat opened from 59 to 58 3 sold between
59Vs and 67% Â» n( l 573/^ c, closing at the Inside,
y g c under yesterday. Estimated receipts for to
morrow. 100 cars
CORN â There was a complete lack of spirit and
an entire absence of strength in corn. Ihe prim
ary consideration was the heavy movement, 1114
cars coming in to-day. Liverpool cables were i 2 (<$
%a lower. Withdrawals from store were moder
ate at 163,020 bushels. The prospects of an enor
mous crop acts as a deterring factor to buyers.
Export clearances were 177,716 bushels. Septem
ber corn opened at 25VgC sold between 2514 c and
243/ B e. closing at 245/Â« c. iy 8 c under yesterday.
Estimated receipts for to-morrow, 750 cars.
OATS â Sympathized a little with the o'.fcer
grains, but there wag present an undertone of firm
ness which held prices fairly steady. Receipts
were 218 cars. There . were no withdrawn,' from
store. Export clearances were- very heavy, at
609,258 bushels. - September oats closed W&*'Â»<'
under yesterday. ' Estimated receipts for to-mor
row, 115 cars. ' ;
FLAXâ Was weak; cash, 73c,, closing at 72c
nominal; . September, 72c; : December, 74c. Re
ceipts were 32 cars.
PROVISIONSâ Were quiet, presenting no Inci
dent at all. Trading was generally weak, al
though an exception to the rule was noted on
pork, which ' rallied shortly after the opening,

Councilman J. R. Cape.ll will never again
'. ' look at the .big clock over the president's
Councilman J. R. Capell, a Pioneer of ' 49, Who Was Found Dead in Bed Yesterday ,
head, shrug his sbonlders and say, as he [
has said scores of tiuxes : "Time for young j
fellows like me to go home." Tbe honest i
old man has gone home. He attended the
Council meeting last nigrlit and was in his
usual good health. This morning his
daughter found hi a dead in bed.
=J. R. Capell was a sturdy old pioneer,
and." although he was one year past the
allotted three-score and ten, in all his long
life he never was known as any other than ]
a strong-minded, uprieht man. No one j
ever suggested anything to tarnish his !
name, either as a man of business or as an j
official. A "professional lobbyist would j
have met with a hard reception from the
old man. as he was honest.
In the Council meetings he was some
limes curt, often thought to be unneces- !
sarily "inquisitive, but he always wanted :
to Know on what -he was voting, and al- j
ways voted his conscience.
â¢ yir. Capell kft the Council chamber
about 10:30 o'clock, and was noticed by â 
Councilman Heitman as he passed out,
who remarked, "Sneaking out, are you?"
Mr. CapÂ£ll replied, "Well, it is time for
ybnng, iellows like me to be at home."
â¢ He a|wavs sJeeps late on Tuesday morn
ing after a Council meeting, so the family
hftd breakfaÃt, and paid no attention to
â¢his c < ab-ence. When seen this morn
ing Miss Hafti*? said:
'The last time father spoke to me was
at the dinner tnbie last night. I noticed
him this morning as 1 passed tne door,
end saw him turn his head once. I paid
no more attention to bin until 1 thought I
he should get ur>, when I went into his
room and tpoke to hire."
Â°Tftr. Capell was a member of University j
Lodge No. 144, i. O. O. f'., and had been its j
treasurer for seventeen consecutive years. |
At the last election, a month ago, he re
fused a re-election. At that time suitable
were passed and an engrossed j
copy o presented to him, which the family
prize highly. This lodge will have entire
charge of the funeral ..services, which wiil
be held on Thursday if the absent son ar
rives on time. He was also a member of
the%Loyal Lei:ion of Honor and tbe
Equitable Aid Union No. 'J24, both of East
Oakland.
The deceased had a crown-up family
besides bis wife. Miss Hatt>e, Miss Mat
iie and H. P. Capell reside at home, while
W e . K. Capell iÂ« a railroad engineer run
iiine out of \Yelis, Nev. He was tele
graphed fur at once and is expected to
reach home to-morrow niuht.
Immediately upon being notified of Mr.
CapelPs death Janitor Wilds placed tbe
flag at half mast on the City Hall. Presi
dent Mott called a 'special meeting of the ;
Council for 4 o'clock this afiernoon. At j
the appointed time all of tbe members j
were present except Councilman Dow.
Messrs. Manuel, Marshal, Dam and
Mayor Davie were appointed as a commit
tee to prepare suiiable resolutions to be
presented to the Council at its next meet
ing. Tbe clerk was instructed to drape
the empty chair and desk appropriately
before the next meeting. Tbe president of
the Council, Moti, was appointed to repre
sent the Council in comerences with the
family and Odd Fellowa' Lodt?e in regard
to the place the members would occupy at
the funeral. Councilmen Heitman and
Watk-inson were appointed to secure a
suitable floral offering, and tbe janitor
was requested to keep ibe flag over the
City Hall at half mast until after the
funeral. Â .
An autopsy showed that deatn resulted
from valvular disease of the heart.
Mr. Capell wt\s a member of tbe Council
at large, and his successor will be chowi
by Mayor Davie. While it is not neces
sary, the probability is that ho will select
a man from the Seventh Ward, in which
Mr. Capell resided.
Mr. Capell was born Jn Southampton
County, Vireinia, in mi. In 1845 his j
parents, who bud adopted him, moved j
to Alabama, taking him aioug. The next 1
year war was declared in Mexico and
young Capell enlisted as a private. He
joined a company which was sent to Mo
bile, from which point they marched to
Brazos, Mexico. Near here he was under
fire for the first time. He was mustered
out on June 1, 1847, at New Orleans. On
the 14th of the same month he joined a
company of thirty-three men and made a
start for California. They took a southern
route, met witn accidents and ran out of
food. After suffering many privations the
party reached Austin, Texas.
It was in March of 1848 before they got
away from there and crossed Arizona by
the Colorado Cnnyon. lie passed through
Los Angeles and Santa Barbara, reaching
Stockton on the 17th of August, 1849. He
staid in tbe mines until IS7I without mak
ing any notable stake. He then came to
Alameda County and began farming.
Two years later be came to Oakland and
went into business with the Merritt Lum
ber Company. In 1879 he formed a part
nership with N. Benedict and went into
the real-estate bufiness, which he followed
for twelve years. He afterward joined
G. A. Willard in the same business, but
retired entirely two years ago.
Refuses to Talk.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 28.â John Mor
tenson, arrested at San Leandro for de
stroying public property, and who escaped
from the County Jail about three weeks
ago and later recaptured, is now sham
ming insanity. He refuses to take the
bath required by the prison rules and de
clines to talk, and has assumed the air of
an imbecile. A confederate of his pleaded
Kuilty and received a three years sentence
in prison.

OAKLAND, Cal., July 28.-Mrs. Anna
A. Woodward to-day filed a divorce suit

NO TEACHERS ELECTED.
The Board Is Enable to Unite Upon
m Candidate for Drawing
Teacher.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 27.â The Board
of Education met last evening to elect a
teacher for the cooking school and the
drawing department, but after being in
session over two hours adjourned without
doing either.
Director McMullan moved to have the
matter of selecting a cooking teacher
laid over until the regular meeting in
order that the board might know the
exact number of pupils they were going to
have in that department. When Director
Knox stated tbat it was necessary for
the pupils to study chemistry for six
months preparatory to taking up the
practical work the board agreed to let the
matter go over.
Director Moody made the suggestion
that called the board together last night
to elect a drawing teacher. When he took
the floor and moved that the matter be
laid over every one of the others were sur
prised. Director McMullan came to his
rescue and together they tried to get a
postponement.
President Clement caused a laugh when
he asked Mr. Moody if the meeting was
not called at his request. He admitted
the impeachment and looked considerably
crestfallen as he took his seat.
Paul Garin, W. W. Fceg and Miss Flor
ence Jackson were placed in nomination.
The first ballot stood: Garin 5, Fogg 3.
Jackson 1. Two more ballots resulted the
same. On tbe fourth the Jackson vote
changed to Fogg and one of Garin's. In
the lifth it stood the tame and then tbe
board decided to take Director Moody's
advice and lay the matter over a week.
Secretary McClymonds reported over
7000 pupils in school for the opening day.
CHANCES AGAINST HIM
Winnie Not Kxpected to Survive the
Gaa He Inhaled on Monday
Evening.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 28.â Mr. Winnie,
the contractor who was found nearly as
phyxiated in an office of the Builders' Ex
change yesterday morning, is still uncon
scious and the doctors pronounce his case
as surely fatal. Each hour draws him
closer to the grave.
The physicians hoped this morning tbat
he might gain consciousness, but as the
day drew toward a clo?e they lost hope.
His wife and friends are with him at the
Receiving Hospital, and attendants are
doing all in their power for him.
_He had been in poor health for some
time, and as he had lost considerable of
late, besidesjbeing out of employment, it is
thougbt tbat he attempted suicide rather
than ask for aid.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JULY 29, 1896.
OLD AND SICK AND
READY TO DIE,
Was on Her Way to Drown
Herself in Lake Mer
ritt.
SAVED FROM AN ENGINE.^
Mrs. Hunt's Sensational Attempt
to Commit Suicide at the
Depot.
MADE UP HER MIND TO DIE.
Disappointed at Being Foiled, She Was
Sent Home in the Patrol-
Wagon.
OaklaudOfftci San Fbakcisco Call,)
908 Broadway, July 28. S
Old Mary Hunt is still alive, but she has
made up her mind that there is nothing to
live for, and if the narrow-gaugo engine
had not slowed up last night Mary would
have ended her sorrows on the track.
As the last train from San Francisco was
dashing up Webster street, at midnight,
an old woman stood on the track. There
are but few people on the streets at that
hour, and the glare of the headlight was
full on the feeble black figure before some [
one rushed on the track and pulled her
away.
The engineer saw the woman at the
same time, and ac there is a big curve at
that point and the grade is uphill he was
able to materially reduce the speed of his
train in c car's length. He did so, and
just as poor old Mary was pulled to a
place of safety the engine passed.
Officer Mackey had just been ont on a
run to East Oakland with the patrol, and |
as he was returning the woman was given |
into his custody.
At the police station she told a pathetic
story to Prison-keeper Swain.
"I left home after all the others had
gone to bed," she baid. "I did not want
to arouse them, so I slipped out of the
house. lam an old woman, over 70 years
of age. and I want to die. Yes, I want to
die, as I have nothing left to live for."
The old lady sank on to a bench ard
cried bitterly. Jailer Swain encouraged
her to continue with her story, and she
did so. .
"I intended to go to Lake Merritt and
there â " It was several minutes before
the broken-hearted creature could apeak.
"Yes, I had made up my mind to jump
into the lake.
â¢When 1 had walked as far as Webster
street, going toward the lake, I was so
weary that I sat down on a bench to rest.
My feet were sore. I have had no stock
ings for weeks and ray shoes hurt my feet.
I started to walk toward the lake, and as I
did so I saw the train coming up Franklin
street. I said to myself, why should I
take the long, darÂ£ walk when 1 can end
it right here? I did not hesitate a mo
ment, for I had made up my mind that I
wanted to go. 80 what difference did it
make to me which way I ended all?
"I saw tbÂ« light and I never saw a iignt
look so pleasant in my life. I stared at it
and I believe that if I wanted to walk off
the track I could not have taken my eyes
off that light. Somebody pulled me off
the track. 1 do not know why they did
it. I wish they had left me alone and by
this time all would have been over."
When she finished her narrative old Mrs.
Hunt was trembling all over. She was
poorly clad and the midnight air was
chilly. Id her haste she had not put her
hat on and her thin shawl was drawn over
her head. At first it was thought that the
poor woman had been drinking, but the
thought was quicKiy dispelled. She was
simply a poor, broken-down old woman
who had outlived her age of usefulness
and who was truly anxious to seek relief
in death.
Officer Mackey took from the prison
dispensary a bottle of a drug labeled
"brandy" and gave the shivering woman
a good dose. She then proceeded to tell
them where her home was and that she
lived with a daughter. The officers were
about to let her depart when she said that
she would not trouble any one much
longer.
There was a tone about her "Good
night" that caused the jailer to call her
back. He refused to let her go alone, so
the patrol-wagon was pressed into service
and Officer Mackey took the woman to her
home at Twentieth and Chestnut streets.
Her friends were surprised when she was
delivered to them by an officer, and still
more so when they heard of her midnight
mission.
POLITICAL EQUALITY CLUB
Our Country's Sin Is Selfishness,
Its Virtue Independ
ence.
Dr. Bovard Has Acted Successfully as
a Policemanâ Jewish Residents to
Combine to Form a School.
AItAMEDA, Cal.. July 28.â The Politi
cal Equality Club met last night at the
house of Mrs. Â£. A. Smith, 1725 Alameda
avenue. Mrs. Nlco Beck-Meyer delivered
a philosophic address on the status of
women of past times in tbe home and the
nation that held tbe attention of her nu
merous listeners. Drawing the lesson to
be learn ea from pre-existing generations,
â he said that each nation had its weak
ness and its strength. Our own country's
sin is selfishness; its virtue, independ
ence. Politics should be the expression of
the deepest love of a nation. Our work is
to write everlasting laws of justice and
fulfill them. It is a legacy we owe to the
coming generation, and now is our time
to do it. Ignorance of these vital ques
tions is only another name for selfishness.
Mrs. Beck-Meyer closed by reading an ex
ttactfrom a Danish book describing the
organizing and executive power of a wise
and good woman.
Miss Jane Roulston of San Francisco
made a very earnest speech. She held
that "we are on the verge of a miehty
crisis unparalleled in history, and~ we
should feel proud that we live at a time
when such conditions exist and we are
here to meet them."
In speaking of her own sex she declared
she had no patience with women. "Some
women are no better than beasts," she
said. Though not prepared to say what
tbe immediate effect on politics woman
would have, she held it as an axiom that
two strong; human beings are better than
one.
To her roind it was necessary that
woman suffrage in California be made
possible this year, or the cause of woman
would receive a serious setback.
Green Majors also spoke, his theme
being that as property rights are elevated
so surely are human rights and equality
01 rights decreased and degraded.
Mrs. Long's remarks were confined to
the necessity of carrying on the work of
suffrage education in each precinct.
A Clergyman as Folicemau.
ALAMEDA, Cal., July 28.â Dr. Bovard
in commenting on Chief Rogers' remarks
on his Sunday prelude says: "I do not
know why Chiei Rogers 3bould consider
me incompetent as a policeman. Sergeant
Conrad will bear me out that it is not so
long ago since I ran down one of the
'light-fingered gentry 1 on my wheel, and
he was a much larger man than myself,
and handed him over to tbe police. Not
withstanding that the man confessed his
crime 1 was forced to swear to the com
plaint. Inside twenty-four hours tbe
man was behind the bars of the County
Jail. I call that clever."
Steam Up for the First Time.
ALAMEDA, Cal., July 28.â The new
boilers at the City Electric Light and
Power-house were warmed up to-day for
the first time to discover if there were any
leaks requiring attention and to dry up
the masonry. Worn is being rapidly
pushed forward by the contractors now
tnat all legal hindrances have been re
moved, and within a fortnight it is hoped
to have the new plant in operation.
A New Church.
ALAMEDA, Cal., July 28.â The Jewish
residents in Alameda met at Odd Fellows'
Hall last Sunday afternoon and organized
as the First Jewish Congregation of Aia
meda. Gus Zander was chosen president
and S. 8. Green secretary. Rev. Dr. M.
May is rabbi.
A Sunday-School Picnic.
ALAMEDA. Cal., July 28.â The boys of
the Sundav-iichool of St. Joseph's Church
went out to Leona Heights this morning
under the care of Father Sullivan to enjoy
themselves.
SELECT AUTOPSY
OF A SICK COW.
Although Apparently in
Good Health She Was
Affected.
EFFECT OF TUBERCULIN.
Dr. Pierce Provides an Object
Lesson for the City Coun
cilmen.
THEY ARE ALL SATISFIED.
The New Ordinance Will Go Through
and the Dairymen Are on the
Anxious Seat.
Oakland Office Sas Frajictsco Call,)
908 Broadway, July 28. )
This city is at present somewhat agitated
over its milK supply. A very stringent
ordinance is before the Council, and when
it is passed finally the Health Office will
have its hands full.
Some incredulity having been shown
regarding the infallibility of the tubercu
lin tost, the City Veterinarian gave a pub
lic demonstration this morning. Each of
the elite of officialdom received the follow
ing unique card of invitation yesterday:
: Health Department, Oaklakd, Cal.,) :
: Fifteenth at, nr. San Pablo aye., > :
July 27, 1896. > ;
: Dear Sir: Yon are requested to be pres- :
: ent in an autopsy to be held on a milch :
: cow, which has been subjected to the Tv- :
: berculin Test, according to rules as laid :
: down by the United Sta'.es Bureau of Am- :
: mal Industry at Washington, D. C, and :
: iound to react. :
: Autopsy to take dace at 10 a. m. TueÂ»- :
: day, July 28, at 1720 Webster. :
; Dk. Fred E. Pierce, :
City Veterinarian. :
: ( :
As a result tbe autopsy was a very dis
tinguished affair. Mayor Davie, Presi
dent Mott of the City Council, Council
men Bassett, Buckland, Heitman and
Watkinson, Expert Kaufman, Health Offi
cer Bradley and Drs. Laskey and Shuey
were there officially. Drs. Nickerson,
Pratt, De la Rue, Bueble, Sill, Boyes, Wil
son, FiÃher and Aicerly were there profes
sionally and the Berkeley Health Officer,
was there from curiosity.
There were also others there to whom
the test meant thousands of dollars. They
were the dairymen and they were, per
haps, more interested than any other
class,
When the august assemblage had nerved
itself to tbe point of watching the slaugh
ter, the animal was led out. It was a
pure Durham and appeared to be a very
healthy animal. It belonged to Dr.
Wheeler and no one had any idea that it
was diseased. Last Saturday night it was
treated with tuberculin" and .it at once
showed signs of consumption by its riving
temperature.
Two butchers in fuil uniform took charge
of the an'mal. There is nothing very
delicate about cow-killing and most of
those present turned their heads. Wnen
they looked again the animal was dead.
A few minutes later its vitals were ex
posed and the sub-maxiliary glands proved
the truth of the symptoms developed by
the test. The lungs, although to a lesser
degree, also contained tubercules, and
everybody was .satisfied that the cow had
consumption.
The main object of Dr. Pierce in having
the autopsy public was to impress upon
the Councilmen the necessity of providing
a fund for the purchase of tuberculin and
adopting at once the pending ordinance.
Carriages had been ordered for 11
o'clock, and when the distinguished guests
returned to the City Hall they were all
convinced of the immediate necessity of
action.
Dairyman Fay had doubts about the
tuberculin test being always a reliable
one. He said the only symptom it pro
duced was a rise in the temperature of the
animal and he thought tbat this might be
produced by some other cause. He be
lieved that if the ordinance requiring this
test was passed by the Council the dairy
men would have to go out of business.
Dairyman Fox did not look at the mat
ter in exactly the same light as Mr. Fay.
He said that, while it was a hardship for
owners of dairy cattle to have them con
demned, yet they ought not to expect to
be allowed to sell tbe product of diseased
cows to the public

C Ã¼ b.
BERKELEY. Cal,, Jnly 28.â The first
instance in Berkeley, and as far as can be
learned in California, of a Quaker lady
Dreacner marrying one of her children
took place this afternoon at the residence
of Town Treasurer Squires, in North Berke-
ley. Frank L. Naylor, son of A. W. Nay
lor, cashier of the Commercial Bank, was '
married to Miss Olive A. Squires, Mrs.
Rebecca Naylor, mother of the groom and
a regularly authorized preacher in the
Quaker church, tying the knot.
The ceremony was simplicity In itself,
all the formality usually attending up-to
date weddings being absent. When the
hour for the ceremony came the bride
and groom entered the wedding room
arm in arm and took their places in front
of the lady pastor. They were attended
by no one, not even little flower girls. Â»
"There was no giving away of the bride
by her father nor attendance by maids of
honor or groomsmen. Having walked
into the room of ceremony and taken
their station in a bay-window, Rev. Mrs.
Naylor made a few introductory remarks,
asking if any one objected to the union,
and if not ;o "forever hold your peace."
Requesting the contracting parties to
grasp right hands and asking if each ac
cepted the other "for better or worse,"
she pronounced them husband and wife.
A prayer concluded the ceremony and
then Mr. and Mrs. Naylor were introduced
to the guests.
There was a conspicuous absence of
"thee" and "thou" in the ceremony,
which are often present on such occasions
where Quakers are concerned The newly
married pair left on the evening express
for Shasta, whe-e they will spend their
honeymoon.
Mr. and Mrs. Naylor will live on Shat
tuck avenue unon their return from the
Nortu. About lifty guests were present at
the ceremony.
No Fire Chief Tet.
BERKELEY, Cal., July 28.â 1t was gen
erally expected tbat a Fire Chief would be
chosen at the meeting of the Town Board
last evening, but on account of there not
being a full attendance of Trustees, andot
the fact that considerable opposition exists
against the single candidate, James
Kenny, the appointment was postponed
until the next meeting. Recommendations
of Kenny were read from J. H. Troy, an
insurance agent of Oakland, and from a
number of East Berkeley business men,
about thirty having signed a petition ask
ing that he be appointed.
Populist* "Will Try Again.
BERKELEY, Cal., July 28.â The Popu
lists of Berkeley will make another effort
at organization to-morrow evening. A
meeting has been called to take place in
Pythian Hall, and if a sufficient number
are present organization for the campaign
wiil be effected. An urgent call has been
issued for all Populists of Berkeley to be
present. An effort was made to organize
last week, but because of the few adher
ents of the party present the matter was
postponed.

D ALTON'S MILITARY ROLLS
Supervisor Church Charges That They
Have More Names Than They
Should Contain.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 28.â Supervisor
Church stated to the board that a com
parison of the military rolls made by As
sessor Dalton had been made and had
been found to contain 762 names which had
been duplicated. Supervisor Church is
the leader of the solid four.
He desired to see the Assessor's foes
corrected, as he received 5 cents for esch
name.
"The insinuation that I st uffed the roll
for the sake of $33 10 is absurd ," said As
sessor Dalton. "The mistake is a simple
on . There are about sixty or seventy
fie dbooks and the military roll was made
up 1 from them. It 13 very evident that
one of the fieldbooks was included twice,
as the number of duplicates is just about
the same as the number in each rield
ebook."
*. Premature Staleinent.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 28.â The pub-
lished statements in regard to Rev. Dr.
1 Henry A. Btimp?on accepting a call to the
First Congregational Church were prema
ture. While his name, among many
others, was mentioned several months
ago, it was learned that he could not come
to California, and so published at tne time.
Several leading Congregational divines
have been approached by the committee
on pastoral relations, but as yet no success
I in securing a pastor has been attained.
PROFESSOR KING.
A Scientist Visiting California to Study
Irrigation.
PBERKELEY, Cal., July ,28.â Professor
F. H. King, head of the department of
agricultural physics at the Wisconsin
State University, one of the foremost men
of his State and an authority on soil
physics, having written a complete work
on that subject, was the guest of Professor
E. W. Hilgard to-day at the State Univer-

ests of Irrigation.
sity. Professor King arrived from the
East on last Saturday, having come to
California for the purpose of investigating
the systems of irrigation practiced on the
coart.
Professor Hilgard escorted him abont
the botanical gardens, agricultural experi
ment station, tobacco patches and through
the greenhouses and conservatories. The
distinguished Wisconsin professor was
appalled at the sight of certain
kinds of vegetation growing in a
prolific Btate without water, which
if in his State would wither away and die
m a few days without extensive and con
tinued irrigation. He was indeed sur
prised to see stately stalks of green corn,
mammoth cucumber vines, four-foot arti
choke stalks, rice-paper trees, mestang
grapevines, native gourds, ever-blooming
acacia and a myriad of ordinary vegeta
bles and flowers breaking their very stalks
with such a rank growth ol foliage, grow
ing wholly without irrigation.
The professor goes south to-day.

DECLINED SECOND PRIZE.
Mr. Johnson Wished First or
Nothing in the Cake
Walk.
IHe Cried Out Against the Injustice
to Himself an.l His
Lady.
Oaeland Office San Fbanxisco Call,)
908 Broadway, July 28. i
The cake-walk at the Macdonough The
ater to-night was more than a success.
One of the candidates created a sensation
and received a storm of bisse3 by refusing
the second prize, because he thought he
should have been awarded the first.
Mr. Johnson was very mad at the result,
and took advantage of his; opportunity to
deliver a short lecture to the fashionable
audience. 'Popularity should net govern
this contest," said Mr. Johnson! "Only
merit should count, and on behalf of my
self and lady I decline the second prize."
The occasion was the ftreweli benefit to
ex-manager C. E. Cooke and the cake
walk was the star number on the pro
gramme. There were five couples and at
the close "John," the porter at Hanni-
I fin's, was declared by judges and audience
to have earned the goid watch. John
made a speech, but when Mr. Johnson was
awarded the order for a suit of clothes he
scornfully declined.
"Major" Waters was therefore declared
the winner of the second prize. The
major is Oakland's 7-foot colored man and
he received the order for the clothes very
j gallantly.
The major is, every inch of his 84, a
gentleman. He made a speech of than ks,
and assured hia numerous friends in the
audience- that he would be seen on Broad
way on Sunday dressed in his new suit.
The major also said lie would be "at
home" to-morrow to any of his friends
who might wish to call and congratulate
him, and as he did so he bowed very cour
teously to the fashionable coteries in the
I boxes. ''Joe," the proprietor of a shoe
black stand, was awarded the third prize,
! a lur.ije cake. The affair created great en
thusiasm, and the ruffled temper of Mr.
Johnson only served to add a new but
welcome number to the programme.
Second Ward Republicans.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 28.â At the meet
i ma of the Second Ward Republican Club,
! T. R. Porter president, at Milton Hall on
; Thursday evening, there will be addresses
I by candidates and action will be taken re
-1 garding the Congressional primaries of
I next week. The club proposes to run a
ticket on that occasion, but it is not known
which candidate for Congressman its list
of delegates will support if successful at
the polls.
The Gold-Brick Swindle.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 28.â The trial of
; Gordon, charged with selling Banker
Stephen G. Little of Dixon a brass brick
! fora gold one, was resumed before a jury
I and Judge Greene to-day. Tue opening
: statements were made, after which the
1 banker related his experience with the al
leged swindlers. It was the same as given
at the examination in the Pelice Court.
In wall to Appear.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 28.â Harry In.
wall, charged with approaching Juror E.
M. Lipka with intent to bias him in the
gold-bricK case, will appear before Judge
Greene next Saturday morning at 10
o'clock and try to convince his Honor that

ONLY ONE BIDDER CAME,
The Reorganization Committee
Bought the Trust
Property.
Sale of the Whisky Distillery Site Was
Largely a Matter of
Form.
Only a small audience gathered at the
Larkin-street entrance of the City Hall
yesterday forenoon to attend the auction
of the property of the whisky trust in this
c City. In truth, as the event turned out,
Jhe matter was really only pro forma and
â¢ while there was an actual sale the prop
erty will still remain in the hands of the
stockholders of the trust.
The troubles of the trust have previons
ly been recounted* in brief. The appoint
ment of General McNulta as receiver was
the result of dissensions among the stock
holders. But these stockholders really
aimed at depriving Mr. Greenhut of power
"and never have Intended to relinquish the
plan devisen for the contro lof the output
of the great whisky distilleries in the sec
tion selected for their operations. While
General McNulta has been closing up the
" affairs of the old concern under the orders
of the Federal courts a reorganization
las been formed, and. this committee has,
counting in the real estate which was yes
terday acquired in this City, practically
gained possession of about all the trust's j
assets. This is of course preliminary to
assuming charge of the business upon the
discharge of the receiver, which will be
effected very soon, as. he has comparative
ly little remaining to be done in this
connection.
H. M. Anthony, who is connected with
the firm of Nowlin & Fassett, the local at
torneys for Receiver McNulta, raised his
voice in an announcement of the condi
tions attending the sale at 10 o'clock yes
terday forenoon. What he said was sub
stanially as follows:
"On behalf of the reorganization com
mittee of the Distilling and Cattle-Feeding
Company, I bid, in the name of John N.
Kenney. the nominee of that committee,
the sum of $33,500 for all the property em
braced within the notice of sale." That
was practically all there was to the event,
with the notable exception that the occa
sion brought out General McNulta in his
capacity of reader in public. That eminent
attorney waded through columns of de
scriptions of blocks and plats in fine ad
vertising type and then paused and
mopped his forehead.
No" one bid against the reorganization
committee. The different parcels were
struck oft separately and then collectively,
and for a short time Mr. Anthony reveled
in the possession, by proxy, of a choice
assortment of fifty-varas and other real
estate of large extent and considerable
value. Altogether, the reorganization
committee had already acquired several
million dollars' worth of assets of the
whisky trust. The amount of $9,500,000
was bid for trnst properties in a sale at
Chicago some time ago, the reorganization
committee taking it all.
Some of the prices named by the reor
ganization committee for San Francisco
realty yesterday follow: There were five i
parcels in all, which were embraced in the
old distillery sites at North Beach and in j
South San "Francisco resDectively. Two j
50-varas between Chestnut, Lombard, De
visadero and Scott streets were sold for
$6000; sixso-varas bounded by Lombard, I
Chestnut, Pierce and Scott were sold at
$21,000. The South San Francisco prop
erties were in three parcels, which brought
$4100, $1800 and $650, or $6600 in ail for the
South San Francisco site, and $27,000 for
the North Beach site. John N. Kenney,
in whose name the properly was bid in, is
also the secretary of the reorganization
committee.

GRAVES OF OLD
SAUSALITANS.
Remains of a Lost Tribe
Found in the Marin
Hill Town.
EARLY DIETARY PERIODS
A Clam Era Marked in the Strata
â¢ Â°of an Indian Grave
Mound.
WHEN THE BEERY CROP FAILED
And the New Man of Sausalito Feeds
â¢ . the Shell and Bcne Fragments
V to His Hens.
There is in Sausalito an old Indian burial
mouad, and every once in a while that
grass-grown tumulus gives up some of its
forgotten dead. It is not pleasant even in
, View of an Old Indian Burial Mound in Sausalito, Recently Opened by a Street Contractor, in
, Â° % Which a Large Number of Skeletons Have Been Found.
Co : . [Sketched by a "Call " artist.]
Sausalito, where peace and pleasure I
perches swallow-like* on the hillside, to
â¢ have a rude and savage past sliding down
from its sepulchral heap into the busy
thoroughfares of the living .present.
Ttje place where the former Sausalitans
Â°laid themselves away to sleep is in the
northern part of the town. A street has
"been cut through the eastern side of the
mound, and many skeletons have been un
earthed. Little except the skulls have
been found in a state of preservation, the
rest of tnese rude residenters having
passed bapk to the dust of their common
grave.
In the perpendicular bank made by the
pick and shovel ot the workmen was dis
covered the-" place where a body had
crumbled . and disappeared. Like tbe
baker^of Pompeii lying in volcanic .ashes,
tlfis aborigine had left his mold when he
had resolyed back to earth again.
In this bank may be seen the succeeding
strata of shells marking the food periods
in the life of the old rancheria. It is the
geological commissary history of the
tribe. The Indians evidently had lived on
tlie big mound, and tbe shells and animal
bones of .their long-ago feasts had been
dropped underfoot. They buried their
dead .there too, underfoot, and. as tbe
refuse accumulations of generations lifted
the living the departed went Tower.. The
deposits of the centuries widened the
space between the quick and the dead.
In the old earthy records can be seen a
strata of clam shells, demonstrating that
this peculiar bivalve flourished plentifully
on the bayshore nard by. The projecting of
an ordinary imagination backward through
, the years wilJLbrin^ to view the early man
of Sausalito with a.niut spadÂ£ gruobing in
. the prehistoric mud for the rn/redient of
o his chowder- pot
Then came a period when another bill
; of fare prevailed after the clambake day

haa darkened. A mussel strata shows
itself, and the soft shells are thick in tbe
era marKed by tbe abundance of that food.
It was the proverbial feast before the
famine that evidently came in the next gen
eration, for the succeeding deposit shows
earth without any evidences of the tribal
menu. Possibly the vegetable and fruit
fad struck the Indians, and the perishable
nature of their kitchen refuse precluded
the leaving of a dietary record. Or more
likely the root and berry crop among the
hills failed also, as a number of skeletons
found in this strata would lead the
archaologist to believe that the famine
was then indeed among the mound people.
The following era was better for the
tribe, for the clams came back. They were
large, firm, fat fellows, with scalloped
shells, so hard that they never crumbled
under the succeeding periods that pressed
down on them. There are only a few
skeletons in this strata, and tbe scientist
reading the unerring pages of the time
may conclude that the deceased died from
overeating.
Then came a geological era when the
fragments of animal b^nes appear â
when the mammalia of the Coast
Range came down to the mound and
graced the festive board. In the
next period neither shell*, bones nor
human remains appear. Probably plenty
smiled among the berry bushes on the
rugged sides of Tamalpais or the esculent
grasshopper swarmed bounteously in the
wild oats during those summers of the
dim long ago. A large number of stone
mortars and pestles found here is evi
dence that the acorn output was manna
in the wilderness to the tribe.
However, the ancient people ot Sausa
lito passed down into their mounds and
the grass of to-day grows rankly over their
dead periods. A crove of buckeye and
pepperwood trees send their roots down
among the bones, which the street con
tractor disturbs with his pick and shovel.
Yesterday a newspaper man, standing
in sad contemplation over the tumulus of
a lost race, saw a modern Sausalitan trun
dle a wheelbarrow up to the bank and be
gin to shovel the shells and bones into the
affair.
"It makes good chicken feed," he ex
plained. "The stuff makes the hens lay
better."
To what base uses we may all return.
POINT LOBOS CLUB BUSY
An Improved Condition of the
Richmond District Re
ported.
Several Committees Appointed to
Urge Upon the Authorities
Their Co-operation.
The Point Lobos Improvement Club, by
its continuous agitation of the necessities
of that district, has accomplished much
in the shape of beautifying the homes of
the residents and making good streets out
of what, nad been a waste of sand dunes.
This club, at its meeting last night, sug
gested additional improvements, par
ticularly that of insisting that those who
have built and who are about to build
shall make proper connections from the
d -.veilings into the street sewers.
In the absence of the president, George
R. Fletcher, Vice-President Luke Battles
occupied the chair. William P. Johnson,
the efficient secretary, reported the club
in active and healthy condition, with a
membershipof fifty contributing property
owners.
The special committee which visited
James Winslow, who had received serious
injuries by falling down a ship's bold, re
ported his condition as improving.
It was reported that the protest of the
property-owners against the paving of
Second avenue, from Lake street to Point
Lobos avenue, had prevailed with the Su
pervisors, and as a consequence the work
will be delayed for six months.
A committee was appointed to wait on
â¢the school directors and request that body
to establish an eighth grade in the Rich
mond Scnool.
A similar committee was appointed to
wait on the Market-street Railway Com
pany and request that corporation to re
pair itc track on Seventh avenue.
J. S. Green suggested that a committee
be appointed to wait on the property-own
ers in the district for the purpose of urg
ing them to contribute sufficient to have
the sand cleaned off the sidewalks and the
hoies in the streets filled with macadam ;
also that the contractors living in Rich
mond be invited to be present at the next
i meeting of the club and state for what
I amount they would be willing to perform
I the work.
It was suggested that some member of
the club who was acquainted with Mayor
Sutro wait on him and remind him of his
promise to paint his trolley poles along
the line of his railroa 1.

Letter-Carriers Watched.
The local letter-carriers believe there Is
another "spotter" in their midst In conse
quence of this there Is unusual alertness
amone the men who collect and deliver papers
and letters. It is said that the disguise as
sumed by the present detective is that of a
book agent He goes from house to house, but
alwHjrs just in the wake of a carrier. The men
are very discreet In *peakin X of the mysterious
individual but, just the same, the word has
been passed around the circle that they are
being watched. This same book agent ap
peared in Fresno a few days ago, and in conse
quence complaints are now on file in Washing
ton against every man in the service, with one
exception.

for the prevention of the passage of a
certain resolution, is, according to Super
visor Taylor, thinking seriously of taking
the matter before the Grand Jury.
He held a consultation with Colonel
Tavlor, the chairman of the Finance Com
mittee and leader of the minority, yester
day, and laid the facts before him. Colonel
Taylor advised him lo await developments
in the present efforts of the Grand Jury to
unearth the rottenness that is alleged to
exist in the ranks of the majority, and at
the proper time come forward and tell his
story.
"This last act of this coterie of corrupt
men is the proverbial last straw that
breaks the camel's back," said Colonel
Taylor yesterday while discussing tha ac
tion of the majority. "They have been
running things with a high hand so long
they imagine they are safe in doing any
thing, but the people have turned on
them and the end of the tidal wave that
has risen is hard to prodict. A business
man in this town, a leader in a big corpor
ation, told me to-day that he had paid
money to this crowd in the board to pre
vent it from ruining his business and
asked me what to do about it â whether to
go to the Grand Jury.
"I told him that there was only one
thing to do, and that was to tell the truth,
and the whole truth, when the time came.
This action of the board is infamous, ana
a public insult that shall not go unpun
ished.
"I have rested quietly under the strain
of this thing long enough. Why, 1 never
heard of such a thing. These men think
they can control this City as though it was
their own, but I think they will find to
their cost that the people have been
roused at last. The era when men could
be robb6d and cheated with impunity has
passed, and I think we are approaching an
era when better men will be elected to
office and the affairs of the municipality
will be better managed.
"Since the board passed the resolution
offered by Wagner three of the Supervis
ors have been to me to half apologize for
the insult put upon the committee of
which lam the chairman. I want none of
their apologies, for I know the men.
"When they began to talk to me I told
them that I knew they were corrupt and
that I could prove it, and that if they
wanted to go with me I would take them
to a man who had paid them money, and
that I would show them to their faces that
they had been bribed and how much they
sold out for. Of course they did not have
time to go just then, nor will they ever
have time of their own accord."
If Supervisor Taylor concludes to attend
the session of the board this morning
when it meets as a committee of the
whole those Supervisors who voted to
take the arranging of the municipal ap
propriations out of the hands of the
Finance Committee will probably listen to
an arraignment of themselves such as they
never heard before.
From an incident that occurred Monday
afternoon last after the meeting of the
board it may be imagined that the session
will be a stormy one.
Colonel Taylor entered a downtown
resort to partake of some liquid refresh
ment, when Supervisors Hirsch and Wag
ner entered. The Supervisor from the
Eighth was not present when the resolu
tion of the man from the Twelfth was
passed, and Hirsch went over to the
colonel and imparted the information of
the majority's action as a matter of news.
He had scarcely finished when the Su
pervisor grasped the full import of the
communication and saw the direct insult.
Hirsch Uirly recoiled before the look he
received and the burst of angry denuncia
tion that poured from the colonel's lips.
Those who voted for the resolution were
characterized by as strong epithets as
came into the colonel's mind.
He was gradually worthing himself up to
a pitch of anger where active hostilities
would begin when Hirsch concluded that
discretion was the better part of valor
and made a hasty exit through the front.
Wagner listened with a sickly smile
until the crowd began to thicken about
them, and then he, too, silently stole
away.

BEATEN BY CONVICTS.
They Revenge Themselves Upon Otto
Brown for Testifying Against Them.
Otto Brown, proprietor of the Ran Fran
cisco Pattern Works, 110 Beale street,
swore to a complaint in Judge Joachim
sen's court yesterday charging "John
Doe" and "Richard Roe" with battery.
He showed a pair of black eyes as evi
dence of the offense.
About two years ago Brown's place was
entered by burglars and two men were
arrested, convicted of the burglary and
sent to the State's prison for two years.
Brown was the complaining witness
against them, and the men vowed to get
even with him.
They bad regained their freedom, and
Monday night they met Brown on Beale
and Mission streets. They at once pro
ceeded to administer a terrific beating
to Brown, and left him in a helpless
condition. He did not recollect their
names, but the police will endeavor to
find them from the records.
To the Asylum.
Edward Weir, the tea-peddler, who bas been
annoying various young ladies with his atten
tions, was yesterday returned to the Ukiah
Acylum.
George W. Brandon was sent to Napa. Hs is
very violent, and had to be forwarded in a
strait-jacket.
Attorney Friedlander and His Bride Is aping by a Window In Justice of tbe
Peace Groezinger's Courtroom Immediately After the Ceremony The
Justice Is Assisting the Lady.
MARRIED AND
RAN FROM MAMMA
Hasty Wedding of A. A.
Friedlander and Norah
Stratton.
ESCAPED BY A WINDOW
An Angry Mother Clamored Out
side During the Cere
mony.
A SENSATION AT THE HALL.
How a Young Attorney Won a Bride
and Escaped the Conse
quences.
With an angry mother hammering and
clamoring frantically at the door and an
open window behind them as a means of
escape Albert A. Friediander, a young
Police Court attorney, and Norah Stratton,
a pretty young girl, were married yes
terday by Justice of the Peace Groezinger
under circumstances exciting enough to
satisfy the most fastidious lover of adven
ture.
M iss Stratton's mother objected to her
marrying Friedlander on the ground
among other things of his inability to
support her daughter, but the young
people were not to be denied, and as both
were of age, be being 30 and she 22, a
license was procured and arrangements'
made for the ceremony to take place yes*
terday.
Somehow Mrs. Stratton learned of her
daugh ci's intention and determined to
frustrate the marriage if possible. To
this end she went early to the hall yester
day afternoon and haunted the corridors
in the vicinity of the justices' courts.
Friediander asked Judge Conian to
perform the ceremony, but thai astute
jurist learned of Mrs. Stratton's presence,
and was also told that she meant mischief,
so, scenting trouble, he refused to have
anything to do with the matter. Then
Friedlander wÂ«nt to Justice Groezinger
and negotiated for a ceremony in his
chambers. He did not show up at the
appointed time, but a messenger - boy
brought the following note written on a
telegram blank:
Friend Oroezinger: Hold the fort (I mean the
court), lam coming. Will be there as soon as
possible. A. A. Fr.IED'.ANDER.
Meanwhile Mrs. Stratton was stamping
up and down the corridor, glaring out of
the windows and showing in v general
way that she was not in a yery peaceable
frame of mind.
By this time a score or more of public
officials, clerks and others, had scented a
scene and were standing about the cor
ridors and in the Justice's chambers,
awaiting the climax that seemed inevit
able.
By some strange chance Friedlander
appeared with his fiancee and a lady friend
just when the old lady was off guard for a
moment, and were in the chambers and
standing before the Justice before she dis
covered that she had been caught nap
ping.
The word had reached Jus'ice Groez
inger that trouble was on the tapis ana he
instructed Bailiff Barney Gonlon to guard
the dour and see that no disorder dis
turbed the ceremony.
Just as the momentous questions were
being asked an angry voice sounded from
outside.
"Open the door. I want my daughter."
The demand was accompanied by a tre
mendous thumping on the door that
threatened to break the glass.

"Look out! she may have a gun," said I
one of the spectators just as a tremendous i
blow reverberated through the chambers {*
and everybody, including the Justice,
dodged and looked scared.
There was a quaver in the voices of all j
three of the active participants in the j
marriage a? the blows redoubled on the
door, and Mrs. Stratton yelled:
"Open the door, or I'll break it in."
Finally, however, the ordeal was over,
and tbe* business of getting away was 1
faced. The open window furnished the
solution, and hand in hand, preceded
by Clerk Morgenstern of Police Court
2, who was present, the young couple
mounted the sill, tbe bride being gallantly
assisted by the Justice. With one friptit- .
ened bckward dance to see whether Mrs.
Stratton had forced an entrance, they
stepped on to the gallery that encircies
the inner court of the hall, ami piloted by
Clflrk Tim Sullivan started on their journey
to a place of safety.
"Don't leave me, boys," implored
Friedlander when bis escorts gave signs
of returning, and out of respect to his
wishes they remained by his side.
Mrs. Stratton was permitted to enter
the chambers after her daughter had de- j
parted, and seeing that the party had es
caped gave utterance to a scathing criti- I
cism on "California marriage laws" and j
started on a hunt for her daughter and
son-in-law.
They dodged her, however, and the last
seen of Mrs. Stratton she was interview
ing a policeman. Mrs. Josephine Baldwin
and J. Baldwin signed the certificates as
witnesses.
The young couple are now staying with
a sister of the groom.
BETTER SCHOOLHOUSES.
Their Annual Overhauling and Repair*
ing Under the Direction of In
spector of Buildings Klncaid.
The public schools will reopen next
Monday, and it is safe to say that the nu
merous schoolhouses will be in a greatly
improved sanitary condition. Inspector
of Buildings Kincaid has kept an extra
force of men busy during the vacation
making repairs so far as the finances
would permit.
All of the primary, grammer and high
schools have been generally overhauled
and renovated. The stoves and pipes have
been fixed so that the pupils and teachers
will not suffer from cold this coming fall
and winter. Tne whitening of fifty nine
schoolhouses is well under way prepara
tory to painting as many of them as may
be possible with the appropriation, yet to
be announced, for the coming year.
At the Redding, the Stanford and the
Lafayette schools tbe dangerous old stair
cases have been replaced by new onos.
New offices and lunch-rooms have also
been put into tbe Redding and the La
fayette schools. A new classroom has
been added to the Monroe Primary and
in nearly all of the other schools the fur
uiture has been cleaned and polished,
windows and yards repaired, etc. Men
are now at work upon the ieaky roofs of
the school buildings and they will all be
waterproof before the rainy season sets in.
These repair , though, are merely a
drop in the Ducket, for it is the intention
of the authprities, if they can get the
money from the Supervisors, to expend
not less than $150,000 in urgently needed
building repairs this coming year.
