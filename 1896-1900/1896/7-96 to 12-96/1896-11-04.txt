Is Proclaimed the
People's Choice.
THE VICTORY GRAND AND
DECISIVE.
Bryan and His Silver Heresies
: Buried 'Neath an Avalanche
of Patriot Ballots.
McKINLEY RECEIVES OVER 300
ELECTORAL VOTES.
â¢Unprecedented Majorities in New York, Ohio and
Illinoisâ The Solid South Brokenâ Popoerats
Everywhere Are Swept Away by the
National Republican Cyclone.
â¢ The Nation has spoken "and its voice was like the sea." The Republican land
slide of 1894 was but a mild prelude to the all-sweeping Republican cyclone of 1896.
" Bryanism and all the word implies has been buried so deep beneath the ballots of the
American people that it can never again rise to threaten the peace and prosperity of
the land of Washington and Lincoln. The predictions of The Call with regard to
the result of tne election have been amply verified. In thunder-tones the masses
have declared that our National honor shall be preserved inviolate; that this Re-
public, its structure planned by peerless statesmen and cemented by the blood of
heroes, is no place for strife-stirring men of anarchistic breed; that the country shall
pay its honest debts with honest money; that repudiation and free silver and all the
other Popocratic heresies were nightmares of a campaign dream that have passed
away' with the glorious awakening at the rising of the McKinley sun. Tbe solid North
â  is almost a unit for tbe principles championed by the idolized sage of Canton. The
solid South is rent asunder for the first time since Grant defeated Greeley in 1872.
Every State east of Colorado and north of the Ohio River has proclaimed itself for
sound money and protection by majorities that are stupendous. Tbe Empire State
has led the procession with the tin precede, ted majority of 300,000; Illinois is won by
140,000; Ohio will give McKinley the biggest plurality ever recorded in its history ;
the New Enpland States, standing for the National honor, have shown their contempt
of the Bryan craze, just as Plymouth Rock shows its scorn for the waves that assail it,
only to break forever as they strike its adamantine base.
"Maryland, my Maryland," has written her name upon the roll of honor along
with a majority of 10,000 for tbe Republican ticket; Tennessee's banner is unfurled
to the breeze with the tale of 20,000 for McKinley and Hobart; Delaware is Repub
lican; New Jersey is Republican; Kentucky is almost certainly in the Republican
column.
And, to cap the climax, the home State of William Jennings Bryan, it is
claimed, has rolled up a majority for MrKinley. Bryan's own town of Lincoln has
gone for McKinley by 1700 plurality, and Bryan's own precinct has been carried by the
Republican leader.
The indications are that William McKinley will go into tbe electoral college with
at least 311 votes out of the total of 447, or eighty-seven votes more than is necessary
to elect him President of the United States. More than this, the cyclone has buried
the hope? of Popocratic Senators in so many States as to practically assure a sound-
money Republican uppsr house of Congress to act conjointly with a Republican
House of Representatives in sustaimn;: and putting into practical effect the healthful
.and wholesome and universally beneficial principles which the people have demanded,
and which will quicken every impulse of commerce, industry and trade from Maine
to the Go'den Gate and from the great lakes to the Mexico Gulf.
Illinois performed its duty well in a most important respect aside from the Pres
idential conte-t. It turned down Altgeld, the anarchist, and elected John R. Tanner
Governor by a vote that will run close to the Republican majority on the National
ticket. Thus Bryan and Altaeld are, as it were, buried together in one grave. The
chief actors in the shameful Chicago convention have been punished for their reck
less un-Ameman presumption. Their per licious influence has been wiped out of
American polities. The battle was grandly fought and magnificently won. The
country is safe. Let all rejoice in the triumph of McKinley und Hobart ! Lat us
all look forward to tne certain reward that shall come from yesterday's victoryâ the
confidence that shall loosen up the money which has for mont s been locked away
. throujth doubt and fear, and the protection that shall start the mills and give employ
. ment to the hosts of laborers who have long been idle. Let us jubilantly welcome the
* return of '-Peace, Protection and Prosperity."

was: Cleveland. D., 138,138; Harrison, R.,
9197; Weaver, Pop, 85,181.
MONTGOMERY, Ala., Nov. 3. â The
â¢vote cast in the State from the present
â outlook wilJ be much less than in Augnst !
this' year or in November, 1892. The ticket |
is so long that but few boxes have been j
received and the counting is slow and
tedious.
Bryan will have the State, but by a
.greatly reduced majority. Clark, sound
money candidate for Congress in tbe Sec
ond District, and Coiner, in the Third, are
making strong runs, with even chances of
â success.
ARKANSAS.

LITTLE ROCK, ark., Nov. 3.â As far
The San Francisco Call.
as learned up to a late hour to-night the
election in tbe State passed off quietly.
Reports from the interior indicate that a
fair vote was polled, while a slight de
crease is reported from the cities. The
three Populist elector* on th* Demo
cratic-Populist fusion ticket, headed by
Master Workman Sovereign of the
Knights of Labor, were badly scratched
in this and other cities of the State. The
National Democratic party had no elec
toral ticket in the field. Chairman
Cooper of the Republican Btate Central
Committee concedes Bryan's majority at
45.000, while the Democratic Committee
says it will reach 60,000. The Conces
sional ticket is also conceded by Chair
man Cooper. It is not known how the three
Populist electors will vote, but it is be
lieveu thit they will vote for Watson.
Little Rock gives Bryan 848 majority.
Thw county goes 1500 for Bryan. Greene,

was: Cleveland, D., 118,151; Harrison, R.,
118,027; Weaver, Pop., 25 311.
SAN FRANCISCO, Cal., Nov. 3.â Fine
weather throughout the State brought out
a heavy vote. The voting progressed qui
etly and no disturbances of any kind are
reported. In San Francisco the returns
indicate that Me Kin ley leads. Chairman
McLaughlin of the Republican State Com
mittee declines to give any estimate of the
vote, but be believes that McKinley will
carry the State. On the other hand Chair
man Alvord of the Democratic State Com
mittee claims the State for Bryan by a
safe majority. Boh s;des maintain that
they will elect a majority of Congressional
candidates and also secure the next Legis
lature on joint ballot.
At midnight returns from Southern
California indicated that balloting bad
been strongly in favor of McKinley, al
though the fusion vote was quite heavy at
many points. Bryan has carried several
of the central and northern counties of
the State by small majorities. The count
in the City continues slow, but at ibis
nour McKinley maintains his lead.
COLORADO.
Electoral votes 4. In 1892 the popular vote
was: Harrison, R., 38,620; Cleveland, D.,
; Weaver, Pup., 53,584.
DENVER, Colo., Nov. 3.â Bryan and
Sewall have earned Colorado by a plu
rality of 130,000. The count is coming in
slowly, owing to the fart that there are
eleven tickets in the field and the cumber
some manner in which the ballot is eot
up this year. Democrats, Silver Republi
cans, National Silver and People's party
fused on Bryan and Sewall electors. Mc-
Kinley electors get 40,000 votes and the
Republican party losses are 56,000. which
were cast for Bryan and Sewall. Seventy
six thousand Populist votes were cast for
Bryan. Tbe gold Democrats are simply
an incident to the campaign. The mid
dle-of-the-road Populists cast about 8000
and the balance scattering.
This State pave Weaver 16,000 plurality
four years aco. The Legislature is a mix
ture, composed of a fusion ot all parties, a
unit for silver aim all pledeed tc the re
turn of Senator Teller to the United States
Senate.
On the State ticket the indications at 9
F. m. point to the election of the Bailey
ticket. This ticket ii composed of Popu
lists, Siiver Republicans and National
party men, and was caused by the straight
Republican ticket, headed by Allen, draw
ing the number of votes it did from
Adams, heading tbe Democratic and Sil
ver Republican ticket.
CONNECTIUT.

has swept the State by about 50,000 plural
ity in a total vote of 170.000. Lorine A.
Cook of Winstead R. is elected Governor
by a plurality of perhaps 35,000.
Tbe four Republican Congressmen are
all elected by majorities ranging from
6000 to 15,000. The Legislature will have
a Republican majority of 192 on joint bal
lot, insuring the election of United States
Senator Platt to succeed himself.
DELAWARE.
Electoral votes 3. In 1892 the popular vote
was: Cleveland, D., 18,578; Harrison, R., 18,
-077; Weaver, Pop., 13.
WILMINGTON, Del.. Nov. 3.â There
were minor, brawls to-day in Buss<?x Dis
trict and in two districts no election was
held, the Union Republicans (Addicks)
refusing to permit the anti-Addicks people
or regular Republicans to have voters'
assistants.
In one district of Kent County there
was no election for the same reason. The
only fatal affiay reported was from Balti
more HundreU, Sussex County, where one
man was killed.
McKinley is supposed to have carried
the State, but tbe Democrats get the
Legislature and Congressmen.

ATLANTA, Ga, Nov. 3â There is no
doubt about the election of each of the
Democratic nominees in Georgia. The
aggregate Democratic majority of the
State is about 30,000 for Congressmen and
approximately the same for Brvan and
Sewall.
IDAHO.
Electoral votes 3. In 1892 tbe popular vote
was: Cleveland, D., 2; Harrison, R., 8599-
Weaver, Pop., 10,520.
BOISE, Idaho, Nov. 3.âNotwithstand
ine recent stormy weather a large vote was
polled in Idaho to-day. The estimated
votes cast will reach 28,000. It is now
reasonably certain that Bryan electors
have carried the State by a large majority,
and Steuneburg (D.) for Governor is
elected. Indications alpo point to the
election of a majority of the legislative
ticket favorable to Dubois.
ILLINOIS.
Electoral votes 24. In 1892 tbe popular
vote wm: Cleveland, D., 426,294; Harrison
R., 399,288: Weaver, Pop., 22,207.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 3.â The indica
(ions are. based upon retnrns from all but
100 precincts of Chicago and irom scatter
ing returns outside the city, that McKin
ley and Tanner have carried Illinois by
over 100,000. Tanner is running ahead of
his ticket, but somewhat behind McKin
ley. The returns from 840 of the Chicago
precincts give McKinley 172.70 L Brvan
126.737, Palmer 1490. y U
One hundred and two precincts in Ilii
! nois outside Cook County give McKinley
! 23.480, Bryan 16,050, Palmer 156. In 1892
I Harrison's vote in the same number ot
j precincts was 17,973, Cleveland 15,982.
Eiptity-five precincts in Illinois outside of
Cook County give Tanner 19.477, Altteld
12,982. The vote in 1892 was: Harri
son, 14,827; Cleveland, 12 787.
Chairman Hi;ch of ihe Republican State
Central Commit'ee said at 9 o'clock:
"Illinois hns gone for McKinley and Tan
ner by 125,000. Tanner is running far
{ ahead of his ticket"
Captain John R. Tanner, the Governor
elect, arrived at the Republican head
quarters at the Great Northern Hotel
i from his home in Louisville and was im
! mediately congratulated as the next Gov-
I ernor of Illinois. He said: "McKinley
and I have carried the State by consider
ably over 100,000 minority."
National Committeemnn Jamiesou of
Illinois, who was at headquarters receiv
ing the returns, flgreed that the known
votes in Cook County and parts of the
State outside made Illinois sure for Mc-
Kinley and Tanner and the whole State
ticket by over 100,000 if the ratio of gains
was continued in the rest of the State.
The scattered returns received from out
side of Chicago show large Republican
gains over 1892.
Chairman Hinnchsen of the Democratic
State committee conceded Cook County to
I McKinley and Tanner, and admitted that
Uncle Sam Presents His Favorite Son*
the indications pointed to the rest of the
State going the same way, although he
not give it up until fuller returns
bad been received from the conntry.
Toe Democrats look for larger gains and
generally favorable returns from the sout h
ern part of the State, which has hardly
been heard from yet. These returns are
expected by Mr. Hinrichsen to largely
offset the unfavorable returns from Chi
cago.
Wniteside County gave McKinley a ma
jority of 2500â a gain of 1422 over 1892.
Logan County has been carrie i by 300 ma
jority. It was formerly Democratic by
tiCO. This is an indication of the ratio of
Republican gains from the counties heard
from. Evanston's vote was: McKinley
3087. Bryan 608. The Republicans carried
Pullman by 400 plurality.
Governor Aitneid arrived at the Palmer
House to-day from Springfield and re
ceived the returns in his room. He de
nied that he had conceded his defeat,
claiming that the meager returns did not
warrant the claim of the Republicans that
Tanner was elected.
State Chairman Hinrichsen said at 10
p. m. to the United Associated Presses:
"I am claiming Altgeld's election. The
Chicago returns don't show McKinley's
majority. Altgeld will run 40,000 ahead
ot Bryan in Chicago, and if he m;ikes the
same comparative gains in the country he
will win. Sixty precincts in Chicago show
Altgeld ahead of Bryan 3000. Tanner will
run 40,000 behind McKinley in Chicago.
The Presidential returns are no indica
tion of the vote on the State ticket."
Returns from twenty election precincts
in Co'es County on head of ticket give
McKinley a majority over Bryan of 650
votes, a net Republican pain of 473 over
the vote of 1892. Tanner will fall a few
votes behind.
The total vote in Cook County, with two
precincts m s-ing, gives McKinley 199,445,
Bryan 142,106; majority for McKinley
57,339.
Chairman Smythe of the Republican
Cook County Committee claims that all
I the Republican Congressmen in Illinoi
are elected. Hugh R. Belknap of the
Third District says hi* majority will be
between 14,000 and 15,000.
From advices received by the United
Associated Presses up to 1:30 this
(Wednesday) morning it is believed Major
McKiniey's plurality in Illinois will reach
140000. Governor Attgeld in his bitter
contest with Tanner ran nearly 30,000
ahead of Bryan in the State. Four hun
dred and sixty precincts in Cook County
give Tanner 85,705. A itgeld 70,805. There
is no doubt O: the election of Tanner ahd
the rest of the Republican State ticket,
but their majorities will fall below those
for McKinley.
Partial returns indicate the election of
all the Republican Congressmen in the
"s**^s^l FIVE CENTS.
State excepting the following Democrats'
who are elected: Secretary of State Hin
richsen, Sixteenth Dia'rict; Jehu Baser,
Twenty-first District; A. J. Hunter, Nine
teenth District.
Captain Tanner retired to his rooms at 1
o'clocK with entire confidence that the re
turns from the country districts would not
affect his majority. He claimed that the
counties of Southern Illinois would in
crease rather than diminish his majority,
as claimed by trie Democrats.
Full reports from 1830 precincts oat of a
total of 3033 in Illinois, give McKinley
386,662; Bryan 278,495.
INDIANA.
Electoral votes 15. In 1892 the popular
vote was: Cleveland, D., 262,817; Harrison,
R., 255,615; Weaker, Pop., 22,208.
INDIANAPOLIS, Lnd., Nov. 3.â The
only question about Indiana is the size of
McKinley's majority. Sixteen Indian
apolis precincts show that Marion County
has been enrried by not less than 10,000
and twenty-five country precincts re
ported to the Republican State Commit
tee show an average gain of 25 to the pre
cinct. At the same time the Western
Union returns from twenty-five precincts
show an average i-ain of 10.
There are 3116 precincts in the State.
From these indications already at Repub
lican headquarters the State is'claimed for
McKinley by not less than 50,000. At2
Democratic State headquarters but half a
dozen telegrams have been received. One
of these shows a gain of 35 for Bryan in one
precinct in Owen County and another
shows a Democratic loss of 145 in three
precincts of Grant County.
chairman Martin said his advices on
the whole- lead him to believe that the
Democrats will hold their majority of
1892, which was 7000. The Republicans
claim twelve out of thirteen Congressmen
and the Legislature by a decisive majority
in both branches, meaning a Republican
successor to Senator Voorhees. The can
didates are running very close to the
figures on the National ticket.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Nov. 4âl a. m.
Chairman Gowdy claims the State for Mc-
Kinley by 40,000 and twelve of tbe thirteen
Congressmen. Chairman Martin of tbe
Democratic Committee says: "We have
carried Indiananolis. I have no time to
make estimates.*'
Since midnight tbe returns have had a
distinctly Republican flavor, ana it now
seems clear that tbe Republicans have
both branches of the Legislature and at
least ten Congressmen, with a probabil
ity of eleven.
The chairman of tbe Democratic State
Committee wires Mark Hanna tbat Mc-
Kinley's plurality in Indiana will be
3000.
IOWA.
Electoral vote 13. In 185)2 the popular vote
was: Clerelaad, D., 196,458: Harrison, R.,
219,688; Weaver, Pop., 20,568.
DES MOINES, lowa, Nov. 3.â lovra re
turns to 9:30 p. m. are chiefly from rural
precincts. They indicate uniforn: and
Republican gains. Tue Republican State
Committee now claims the State by 100,
-000, and the Democrats still refuse to
make a statement, declaring their returns
are not sufficiently complete. They ad
mit, however, that tbe situation is a ainst
them. Indications are that the Republi
cans elect all of the eleven lowa Congress
men.
KANSAS.
Electoral votes 10. In 1892 t lie popular
rotÂ« was: Cleveland, D., ; Harrison, X.,
157,237; Weaver, Pop., 1(33,111.
TOPEKA, Kaxs., Nov. 3.â There being
eight long tickets and the Australian bal
lot system the count in Kansas is slow.
Returns from scattering precincts in
twenty counties show Republican gains.
Chairman Simpson of the Republican
State Committee says that McKinley ha
carried tne State by 10,000. that the State
ticket is elected and that the Republicans
have elected at least rive of the eight Con
gressmen and a majority of both branches
of the Legislature. It is doubtful if the
returns will be decided before morning.
KENTUCKY.
Electoral votes 13. In 180' i the popular votÂ«
was: Cleveland, I)., 175,461; liarri&on, R.,
135,441; Weaver, Fop., 23,500.
LOUISVILLE, Ky., Nov. 3â9:15 p. si.â
Tbe returns of the Courier-Journal and
Evening Times and the Republican State
Committee indicate that MtKinley has
carried Kentucky by at least 7500 plural
ity. Republican iandsl.des are reported
from many counties which have hereto
fore been Democratic strongholds.
Ore hundred and thirty-three out of 137
precincts in tbe city of Louisville give Mc-
Kinley 23,871, Bryan 14,285. Ix>uisvilie in
1892 gave Cleveland 17.686, Harrison 11,
-870. The returns from this S.ate are
coming in slowly. One hundred and
thirty-nine out of 1663 precincts in the
State show a Republican gain of 4011 over
1892. Colonel W. C. P. Breckinridge, who
is on the Republican ballot as a candidate
for Congress in the Seventh District, is
running behind the Republican ticket, but
tbe heavy Republican vote in Frankiin
County may pu.lhim through.
In this city Mayor George D. Todd, R.,
is re-elected oy 3000 plurality over Charles
D. Jacob, Ind.
There are no complete returns in from
any Congressional district except this, ttie
Fifth, which re-elects Walter Evans, R.,
by about 6000 plurality.
The Congressional delegation will prob
ably stand: First District, C. K. Wheeler,
Bil. D. ; Second District. J. D. Clary,
Sii. D. ; Third District, G. W. Hunter, R.;
Fourth District, John W. Lewis, R. ; Fifth,
Walter Evans, R. ; Sixth, R. P. Ernst, R. :
Seventh, vÂ«ry doubtful; Eighth, S. M.
Davidson, R.; Ninth. 8. J. Pauh. R. ;
Tenth, J. W. Langley, R.; E.eventh, D.
G. Colson, R.
No serious trouble has been reported,
the election passing off very quietly.
LOUISVILLE, Ky., Nov. aâ Lexington
and Favette counties give McKinley
5591, Bryan 3851, Palmer 51, Breckinridge
5108, Settle 4001.
Indications are that Chief Justice Prior,
D., is defeated for re-election by C. Bow
man, R., in the Fifth Appellate District.
Congressman A. S. Berry is probably re
elected in the Sixth District. Contests in
the First. Third and Fourth districts are
very close. Others stand as sent early in
the nightr
The vote in Louisville and Jefferson
County, with one precinct missing, is:
McKinley 28 821, Bryan 16,537, Palmer and
Buckner 1039. Tbe vote in 1892 was Har
rison 14,406, Cleveland 20,800. The Popu
list vote does not seem to have cut much
figure in the fusion with the free-silver
Democrats. The National Democratic
vote, which went solid for McKinley, car
ried the State for McKinley. At midnight
the editor of the Evening Times places
McKinley's majority in Kentucky at over
10,000, with good prospects of coing to
20,000.
Kentucky has gone for McKinley by a
larger majority than it gave to Bradley
last year. Early returns indicated 15,000
to 20,000 majority, but surprisingly heavy
Democratic gains in the Populist free
silver strongholds of Western Kentucky
may reduce this to 10.000 or 12,000.
The Republicans have elected Con ress
men in six districts and several are In
doubt. Those elected are Hunter in the
Third, Evans in the Fifth, Davison in the
Eighth, Pugh in the Ninth. Langley in
the Tenth and Colson in the Eleventh.
LOUISIANA.

was: Cleveland, D.. 87,622; Harrison, R
13,282; Weaver, Pop., 13,332.
NEW ORLEANS, La., Nov. 3.â Returns
received indicate that Bryan's majority in
Louisiana will exceed 30,000.
Returns at 10 p. m. indicate that Brous
sard is elected in this district, making a
solid Democratic delegation from tbe
Stale.
MAINE.
Electoral votes 6. In 1892 the popular vote
was: Cleveland, D., 48,044; Harrison, R
62,071 ; Weaver, Pop., 2381.
PORTLAND, Me., Nov. 4.â One hundred
and ninety-five towns give McKinley 55,
-175, Bryan 22,164. scattering 3319. The
name towns in 1892 gave Harrison 43,373,
Cleveland 32,452, scattering 3353. Tbe Re
publican plurality now is 33,011 against
10,921, a gain of 22,090.
This is a little over-two thirds of tbe
total vote. Tbe towns to bear from gave
Harrison 19,503, Cleveland 15,596, scatter
ing 2109. II these towns gain ie the same
ratio the total plurality will be between
47,000 and 48,000 a-ainst 14,827 in 1892.
MARYLAND.
Electoral votes 8. In 1892 the popular vote
was: Cleveland, D.. 113,866; Harrison, R.,
92,730 ; Weaver, Pop., 796.
BALTIMORE, Md, Nov. 3.â Maryland
spoke to-day in no mistakable terms for
the gold standard and protection. Mc-
Kinley and the Republican candidates for
Congress and tbe municipal and county
officers swept tbe State. The vote of Bal
timore county complete and the returns
from scattered districts of the counties
point to a Republican plurality ot 30,000
on the National ticket. This is 12,000
mnre than Governor Lownde received in
1895.
MASSACHUSETTS.
Electoral votes 15. In 1892 the popular vote
was: Cleveland, IX, 176,813; Harrison, X.,
202,814; Weaver, Pop., 3210.
BOSTON, Mass.. Nov. 3 âA perfect day
brought out the Massachusetts voters in
swarms and a vast vote was cast and cast
early. It is estimated that 97 per cent of
the registered vota exercised the franchise.
The secret ballot prevents any other
than a general estimate of the situation
being made at tbis hour, but it is a fore
gone conclusion tbat McKinley and Wol
cott, the Republican candidate ior Gov
ernor, have swept the State by the largest
majority on record.
fhej' will get, approximately 200,000
votes to 75,000 for the jJryan electors and
GeorgQ Fred Williams, the Democratic
nominee for Governor.
The indications are that Governor Wol
cott will carry every town, city and county
in tbe State. He will probably carry the
city of Boston, the Democratic Gibraltar,
together with strongholds at Lowell, Law
rence, Fall River and Holyoke.
MICHIGAN.
Electoral votes 14. In 1892 the popular vote
was: Cleveland, D. , 202,296; Harrison, R.,
222,708; Weaver, Pop., 19,892.
DETROIT, Mich.. Nov. 3.â Returns
from the city ana Stsito are coming in
slowly. The delay in Detroit is caused by
the counting ot the city ticket first. Bryan
is running ahead of the ticket in Detroit.
Pingree, R., candidate for Governor, is
running away ahead of McKinley in this
city, butis running oehind in the State.
The indications are that McKinley will
carry Detroit and Wayne County by a
small plurality. Tne few returns from
the State show large Democratic gains.
The Republicans claim ten of the twelve
Congressmen and say they have a fighting
chance to capture the Third and Tenth
Districts, which would give them a solid
delegiition. They claim the State by 50,
-000 to 100.000. The Democrats ciaim that
the Republicans have no figures on which
to base their claims and say that the re
turns from county committees show large
Democratic gains.
Incomplete returnson Congressmen gi^e
Corliss (R.) a lead of 103 over Henderson
(D.) in the First District. They show that
the Republicans are leading in the Second,
Sixth. Seventh, Ninth, Twelfth and Thir
teenth districts and that the Democrats
are leading in the Third. Eighth and
Tenth districts. Smith (R.) is elected in
the Fifth District.
The Democratic State Committee at 11
o'clock claimed that their figures show
that Michigan will go for Bryan by 5000 to
10,000 plurality.
At midnight tbe returns from tbe State
indicate that McKinley will have a plural
ity of 25,000. 'lh<s Republican State Cen
tral Committee claim that will be swelled
to 40,000. The Republicans claim all but
the Third Congressional District.
The entire Republican ticket headed by
Mayor Pingree is elected. The Legisla
ture will be two-thirds Republican. In
Detroit and Wayne County the Repub
licans have elected their county ticket
with the exception of S&enff, and will
gain one or two Aldermen in Detroit.
MINNESOTA.
Electoral votes 9. In 1892 the popular vote
was: Cleveland, D., 100,579; Harrison, R.,
122,736; Weaver, Pop., 29,279.
ST. PAUL, Minn., Nov. 3.â Four hun
dred of the 1117 Drecincts of Minnesota
have reported, enough to indicate that the
State has cone overwhelmingly for Mc-
Kinley. St. Paul has given him a majority
of at least 6000, and Minneapolis has at
least done as well. The State has ap
parently given the Buckeye statesman
about 50,000 plurality. Every county so
far reported gives a big McKinley ma
jority. The only man on the State ticket
who has a chance or election is Lind, for
whom the Scandinavians have voted very
extensively. Lind. however, seems to be
buri d under tne McKinley avaianche. It
is a clean Republican sweep on Congress
men, except the Seventh District. The
First District eoes for Tawney by 8000, the
Second for McCleary by 10.000, the Third
for Heatwole by 2000, the Fourth for
Stevens by 10.000, :hÂ» Fifth for Fletcher
by 6000. the Sixth for Morris by 3000. Ihe
Seventh District is in doubt, but has prob
ably gone for Eddy, R., by a few hundred.
The Legislature is Republican by two
thirds on j lint, ballot.
Late figures continue to show uniform
gains for McKinley and there is no doubt
that be has carried Minnesota by at least
38,000. Lind (Pop.), for Governor, has
made a surprising ran and it may be
found that he is elected. The Republicans
have certainly eleoted their Congressmen
in the first six districts. The Seventh
District is in doubt, with the chances
rather in favor of Lommen (Pop.). The
Legislature is overwhelmingly Republican
MISSISSIPPI.
Electoral votes 9. In 1892 the popular vote
waÂ«i: Cleveland, D., 40,237; Harrison, R.,
1406 ; Weaver. Pop., 10,256.
JACKSON, Miss., Nov. 3.â Fifty thou
sand is the estimated majority for Bryan
and Bewail electors in Mississippi. The
election passed off without a disturbing
incident, Populists generally voting with
Democrats. Tom Watson polled less than
10,000 in the State.
All seven Congressmen are Democratic
all pledged to silver. John M. Allen, John
Sharp Williams and T. C. Catchines are
returned from the Firs, Fifth and Third
districts, while W. V. Sullivan, A. F. Fox,
Pat He.nry ana W. F. Love are new mem
bers from the Second, Fourth, Seventh and
Sixth districts.
No State officers were voted for.

ST. LOUIS, Mo., Nov. 3,-Meager re
turns have been received at Democratic
headquarters up to 9 o'clock. Eighty pre
cincts in tbe State outside of St. Louis
give Bryan 2218, McKinley 1543; Stevens
D., Governor, 1718; Lewis R., Governor
1268.

count of tbe complicated count of the bal
lot it will be late before a calculation can
be made with certainty on the result of
the election in tbe city. Conservative esti
mate-, however, give St. Louis to the Re
publicans by at least 25,000 majority.
Pearce, R., is elected in the Ninth Con
gressional District and Bartboldt is re
elected in the Tenth District. In the
Eighth Congressional District Richard P.
Bland is elected by nearly 40,000 majority.
Jefferson City eives McKinley 200 ma
jority, a gain of 300 Republican to en.
Owing to the requirement that the con
stitutional amendments voted on at tbis
election shall be counted first, the returns
from city and State balloting are retarded,
and the total precinct vote on Presidential
elector-, State and municipal officers will
not be completed until morning. Enough
returns have been received at midnight to
indicate that Bryan's majority in Mis
souri would be about 30,000, wnile Stevens',
D., majority for Governor would be as low
as 15,000.
At midnight Chairman Cook of the
Democratic State committee claimed to
have received assurances that tbe follow
ing Democratic Congressman bad been
elected: First District, Giles; Second, Bo
dine; Third, Dockerv; Fourth, Cochran;
S:xth, De Armond: Seventh, Cooney;
Eighth, Bland; Ninth, dark; Eleventh,
Hunt; Thirteenth, Robb; Fourteenth,
Vandiver; Fifteenth, Uenton.
Chairman Cook concedes the election of
Republican Congressman Neff in the
Fifth, Bartholdt in ther Tenth and Peary
in the Twelfth districts, respectively. The
Republicans have carried the municipal
election in St. Louis by at least 12.000 ma
jority, and it is believed that McKinley's
majority is in excess of these figures. Tbe
Democrats claim gross charges of treach
ery by Democratic Election Commis
sioners.
MONTANA.
Electoral votes 3. In 1892 the popular vote
was: Cleveland, D., 17.551; Harrison. R.,
18,851 ; Weaver. Pop., 7334.
BUTTE, Mont.. Nov. 3.â Returns from
tue State are very meager, but indicate a
smaller majority for Bryan than was ex
pected. Bryan will carry the State by
15.000. Charles D. Hartman is re-elected
to Congress over O. P. Goddard (R."> by
probably 10,000. Robert Smith (fusion)
for Governor is elected by 10,000, and indi
cations are that nearly the entire fusion
ticket is elected by majorities oi 2000 to
10,000. The Populists contributed fully
two-thirds of the Bryan vote, and have one
of tbe three Electors. The next Legisla
ture will be Democratic and Populist.
NEBRASKA.
Electoral votes 8. In 1892 the popular vote
was: Cleveland, D., 24.9-13; Harrison, X.,
87,213; Weaver, Pop., 83,134.
LINCOLN, Nebr., Nov. 3.â Out of the
apparent Republican avalanche in neigh
boring States, Nebraska has seemingly re
mained true to her favored son. Mr
Bryan has, on the face of scattering re
turns, carried the State by from 6000 to
12,000. Chairman Poet of the Republi
can Committee declines to concede defeat,
but the figures disprove his claims. Un
less surprising Republican gains are made
in back counties the fusion electoral as
we'l as the State ticket has gained to-day.
Chairman Dahlman of the Democratic
committee claims the State by 15,000.
Chairman Post of the Republicans will
not concede defeat, but figures point that
way.
OMAHA, Nebr, Nov. 3.â Returns at
midnight show that Bryan's majority in
this State is about 7000, with tbe election
of Holcomb (silver) as Governor and six
silver Congressmen.
Three hundred and ninety-nine precincts
outside of Omaha and Lincoln give Bryan
44 632, McKinley 43,459. One hundred and
thirteen precincts In the country give
Holcomb 11,439 and Mac Coll 9238. Doug
las County, which wug expected to give
McKinley 2000 majority, is about even up
now, with a few precincts to hear from.
Bryan's home precinct gives McKinley
197, Bryan 101, scattering 17. Count of
ward is incomplete, but at about the same
ratio. Careful estimates of the city of
Lincoln indicate a plurality for McKin
ley of 1700.
Five hundred and ninety -seven pre
cincts outside of Omaha and Lincoln give
Bryan 61,504. McKirriey 58.378. Holcomb
leads on the State ticket by 4000 at 3:30 a. m.
About 350 country districts are to be heard
from, which will probably run Bryan's
majority to 12,000.
NEVADA.
Electoral votes 3. In 1892 the popular vote
was: Cleveland, D., 714; Harrison, R., 2811;
Weaver, Pop., 7264.
RENO, Nkv., Nov. 3.â The election in
tbis State passed off very quietly. A
large vote was cast. At this hour reports
ara very meager, as most towns are
isolated. Reports show that Bryan will
carry tbe State by 5030 majority. In the
Congressional fight the Republicans voted
almost solidly for Douglass (Pop.), so as
to defeat Newlands. At last accounts the
race was very close.
Republican managers claim to have a
majority on joint ballot in the Legisla- 1
ture, which will defeat the present Sen
ator, J. P. Jones. The silver party and
tbe Democratic fusion State ticket will
probably be elected.
NEW HAMPHIRE.

TRENTON, N. J., Nov. 4âAt 12:15 a. m.
Mr. Hobart called Major McKinley on
long distance telephone and said New
Jersey would give 75,000 majority.
New jersey has re-elected a solid Con
gressional delegation, as follows: First

Gardner; Third, B. F. HowHl; Fourth,
Mahlon Pitney; Fifth, J. F. Stewart;
Sixth. P. W. Parker; Seventh. Thomas

At 11 p. m. the State Legislature was as
sured to the Republicans by a large ma
jority on joint ballot. Every county has
gone R- publican on the National ticket
but Warren.
NEW MEXICO.
SANTA FE, N. Mex., Nov. 3.â Returns

R., 609,350; Weaver, Pop., 16,429.
NEW YORK, N. V. t Nov. 3.-McKÂ»nley
and Hobart made a clean sweep of the
Empire State. The Democratic plurality
of 45,000 in 1892 was leversed and the un
precedented plurality of 284,000 has been
rolled up for the Republicans. Tam
many's enormous majority in this city
has been overcome and this stronghold of
the Democracy has given a plurality of
21,000 for McKinley. In Brooklyn McKin
ley's plurality is 29,000. In tbe State out
bid of the two cities he has a plurality of
234,000.
In every county and every town there
have been Republican Rains which are
equal to ali that Republican campaign
managers claimed in this State. Frank S.
B:ack R. for Governor is elected by about
240,000. Timothy L. Woodruff R. for
Lieutenant-Governor and Irving G. Vaun
for Judge of the Court of Appeals ari
elected by nearly as large pluralities.
The Republicans have elected twenty
eight Congressmen to the Democrats'
six. They will have about 110 Â«ut
of the 150 members of the State Assembly
and the election of a Republican to suc
ceed David B. Hili in the United States
Senate is assured. About tbe only salvage
from the wreck that the Democrats have
secured is the election of Suizer, Cum
in ings, McClellan, Bradley and Vehslage
to Congress from this city.
Just 2558 districts outside of New York
and Brooklyn give McKiniey 419,096, Bryan
249,180, Palmer 6574. The same districts
in 1892 gave Harrison 335,001, Cleveland
279,437.

Chairman Aver says the fusion ticket has
swept the State.
The Republican chairman of North
Carolina wires Major McKinley that the
State will give him a plurality of 15,000.
At midnight National Committeeman
Daniels said: '"Bryan has carried North
Carolina. Everything else is in doubt.
Reports indicate t c Democrats may elect

FARGO, N. D ., Nov. 3.â Returns have
been received from 204 precincts in twen
ty-eight counties, showing that Major
McKinley has carried North Dakota by at
least 1000 and probably by 4500. Johnson
(R.) is re-elected by 1000 and all the Repub
lican State ticket is elected.
Returns are coming in slowly. One
hundred precinct* beard from at present
give McKinley an overwhelming majority.
Cass, Traill and Morton solid for the Re
publican?. Johnson (R.) for Congress is
in the lead. Briggs (R.) for Governor
leads in Fargo and Cass County.
The returns from North Dakota show
pretty conclusively that McKinley has
carried the State by 5000. The Republicans
elect Congressmen, State officers and the
Legislature.
OHIO.
Electoral votes 23. In 1892 the popular vote
was: Cleveland, D, 404.113; Harrison, R.,

COLUMBUS, Ohio. Nov. 3.â Ohio elect
ed to-day, besides Presidential electors, a
Secretary of State, Food Commissioner,
Supreme Judge ana Pablic Works Com
missioner. The Populists and Democrats
fused on tbe State and electoral tickets.
Each got two candidates ou the State
ticket and tbe Populists gettine five of
the thirteen electors. These five electors
were to vote for Watson. The others
were to vote for Sewail for Vice-President.
All were, of course, to vote for Bryan for
President, There were 850,299 votes cast
in 1892. To-day the total vote was about
929.000 While the returns from Ohio at
this hour, 9:30 p. m., are meager and in
definite, they ail point to a Republican
plurality. In no case do they show a
Democratic gain. The cities show laree
gains, and the rural precincts so far as
heard from show a net Republican gain
of 26 per precinct. Tbis would indicate a
Repuolican plurality in toe State of at
least 50,000.
Tbe following Congressmen have been
elected: First District, W. B. Shattuck,
R. ; Second, J. H. Brownwell, R. ; Fourth,
George Marshall, D. ; Sixth, 8. W r . Brown,

The returns so far received indicate that
the Republican plurality in Ohio will be
slightly in excels of that given for Busb
nell for Governor last year. That was
91.000.
Watson (R.) for Conpr*ss has been
elected in this aistrict, defeating Lentz,
free-silver fusion. It was a close district.
It ie now believed that there have been
but two free-silver Congr- s^men elected,

PORTLAND. Ob., Nov. 3.â The heaviest
vote ever polled in tbe history of tbe State
was polled to-day. At 9:30 o'clock to-night
the chairman of the Republican State
Central Committee said he was satisfied
McKinley's majority would be anywhere
from 5000 to 8000. Portland and Mult
nomab County is depended upon for
Bryan's majority, as it was estimated
Bryan would carry the State outside of
Portland. It is estimated that Bryan will
come to the city with 2000 majority.
Fifty-five precincts in this city, includ
ing all but six city precincts, give McKin
ley 9819. Bryan 5856, with twenty-nine
more to hear from. Only meager, scatter
ing returns up to this hour have been
heard from. The Populist vote for Bryan
shows slight gain in outside districts
heard from in State over vote for Populist
Congressman last June. On the result
depends Senator Mitchell's return to the
Senate next spring, and it now seems safe.
The Republicans will have in next Legis
lature a majority of 24 in joint assembly.
On joint Dallot there will be 57 Republi
cans, 18 Populists, five Mitchell Republi
cans, three Union Bimetallic ana seven
Democrats.

The recent Pennsylvania Senate was
composed of forty-four Republicans and
six Democrats. Of these twenty Repub
licans and five Democrats, representing
the even-numbered districts, hold over,
while the successors to the retiring
twenty-four Republicans and one Demo
crat were chosen at this election. These
elections were held in tbe odd-numbered
districts and resulted in the election of
twenty Republicans and one Democrat,
with four districts doubtful.
Returns from Pennsylvania counties are
coming in very slowly, but indications
from figures received indicate a plurality
in the State for McKinley of nearly 300,
-000. Tbe twenty-one Congressional dis
tricts beard from show the election of
twenty Republicans and one Democrat.
With the two Congressmen at large this
gives the Republicans twenty-two Con
gressmen certain, with chances even for
them in most of the remaining eight dis
tricts. The Republican City Committee
concedes Grow's election.
The recent Pennsylvania House of
Representatives was composed of 175
Republicans and 29 Democrats. An en
tire new body of 204 members was chosen
at this election. Of ibis number tbe Re
publicans have so far as known elected

vote in Charleston was light. The
weather was bad, light rains failing

for all officers from the Presidential
electors down to Coroner, and tne straight
Democratic ticket will in every case win
by a two-thirds majority. Elliott (D.)
has a plurality of about 1500 votes over
his two Republican oppouentsâ Murray

Murray 1 ads Cohen by 2 to 1 here and
almost everywhere else in the district.
The Palmer and Buckner vole was con
fined almost exclusively to the downtown

The gubernatorial contest is close, with
chances favoring Robert T. Taylor (D.)

A. L. Mimms (Pop.). Democrats
claim Bryan ami Tillman have
carried the State. E. W. Carmack SiWer
D. is probably elected to Congress from
the Tenth District over Josiah Patterson
Gold D. T. W. Sims D. defeats McCall K.
in the Eighth by 1000. Rice Price D. is
elected in the Ninth over John H. Mc-
Dowell by a handsome majority. J. W.

Bryan will carry Tennessee by 35,000.
Taylor (D.) lor Governor, will be elected
by 20.000.
TEXAS.
Electoral vote 15. In 1892 the popular vote
was: Cleveland, D., 239,148; Harrison, 8.,81,
-444; Weaver, Pop., 99,038.
AUSTIN, Tex., Novf 3.â The election
passed off quietly, with a very fall vote.
Local tickets were >o mixed that tbe count
is received slowly, and in the city it will
not be completed until morning. Com
plete returns from the Third Ward give
Bryan a majority of two over McKinley,
Vice- President not being voted. . The in
dications are that McKinley will carry the
city and county by a small plurality.
Sawyers (D.) for Congress will have a
large majority in the city and county.
At 9 P. m. meager and scattering returns
only have been received. The counting of
the vote on constitutional amendments
keeps back the reports on electors and
Congressmen. State Chairman filake (D.)
at this hour estimates Bryan's plurality at
100,000; Culberson for Governor 75,000
plurality.
He says a solid Democratic Congres
sional delegation of thirteen members
has been returned. No definite returns
can ba expected before to-morrow.
Returns from over the State come in
slowly. Those received up to 11 o'clock
show an increase in the opposition to the
Democratic ticket of at least 40,000, and
should it be kept up McKinley will carry
the State. Private telegrams Indicate that
the State will be close, but Democrats
claim that Bryan and Sewail will carry it
by 25,000 majority. They also claim that
Culbertson (D.) for Governor will be
elected by 40,000, but returns thus far do
not sustain the estimate. Partial returns
from Congressional districts indicate the
election of Gross (R.) in the Eleventh and
Noonan in the Twelfth. Hawley (R.) in
tbe Eighth District claims he is elected.
Indications are good for the return of
Sayers in the Ninth. He will carry this
city and county by a large majority.
UTAH.
Electoral votes 3. For the first time Utah will
cast electoral votes for President. Since its ad
mission to statehood last year an election re
sulted in the selection of a Rep Ã¼blican Gov

SALT LAKE, Utah, Nov. 3.âExceed
ingly meager returns ar^ to hand at this

reliable estimates show that Bryan and

to Congress by probably 10,000 majority.
The Legislature is in doubt, but it in

close. A heavy vote was polled, and the

WHITE RIVER JUNCTION, Vt., Nov.
3.â Beautiful weather to-day helped to
â¢bring out a large vote. Returns came in
more promptly than in previous y^ars.
The net Republican gains in the toy
heard from, as compared with 1892, is 85
per cent. McKinley's plurality in the
State will be 40.000. The previous high
water in pluralities for President was
30,555 given to Grant in 1872. The State
will have a solid Republican delegation in
Congress.

The majority for Bryan and Sewail in

Electoral votes 4. In 1892 the Dopnlar vote
was: Cleveland, D., 29.844; Harrison, R.,
86,460; Weaver, Pop., 19.054.
SEATTLE, Wash., Nov. 3.â While the
count of the vote progresses slowly indi
cations are that Bryan has carried this
Btate and that James Hamilton Lewis,
Seattle, and W. C. Jones, Spokane, Con
gressional candidates, have been elected.
The contest between Gubernatorial candi
dates John R. Rogers, Pullayup, fusion,
and Potter Charles Sullivan is close.
Democrats, Populists and Free-silver Re
. publicans fu?ed on tbe basis of two electors
for tbe Populis-ts and two for the Dem
ocrats. It is estimated that the Dem
ocrats and Populists polled each three
eighths and the Free-silver Republicans
two-eighths. This city has probably been
carried by McKinley and Sullivan, and
possibly Kinp County. Republicans claim
Sullivan has carried Tacoma and Pierce
County by 1500 majority. Brynn appears
to have carried Spokane City and county
by a good majority, and a number of other
Eastern Wasnington counties.
In proportion to registration the largest
vote in the history of the State has been
cast. During the first two or three hours
following the opening of the polls more
than half the vote was polled. In some
portions rain prevailed, but m this sec
tion the weather conditions were favora
ble.

MILWAUKEE. Wis . Nov. 3.â The in
dications at 10 o'clock are that McKinley
will carry Wisconsin by at least 50,000 ma
jority. Tbe return* for 300 precincts show
a net Republican gain of 2160. The city
of Milwaukee will probably Â«ive McKinley
a small majority. It will be a close race
bet^ein Oijen, R., for Congress and Schil
ling, fusion, with the chances in favor of
the latter. The fusion coumy ticket will
probably be elected in part. The fusion
State ticket is running about 2 per cent
ahead of Bryan, but there seems to be no
chance for its success.

NO. 230 ON HIS BALLOT.
Major McKinley Goes Quietly to
the Polls and Votes.
CANTON, Ohio, Nov. 2.â The weather
in Canton was beautiful to-day and a
neavy vote was polled. Major McKitiley's,
precinct, ward, city, county, as well as the
State, it is believed, will give him unpre
cedented pluralities.
Major McKinley voted at 9 o'clock. He
was accompanied to the polling place by
his brother Abner. They walxed from the
major's home to precinct B in the First i
Wari, and the candidate registered his
vote as No. 230. Quite a number of voters
were around the pulling place when Major
McKinley entered the booth. There was
no dtmonstration of any character, and
the candidate, after casting his vote,
walKed immediately to tbe home of his
mother. Major McKinley and his brother
then drove back to the candidate's Mar
ket-street residence. Major McKinley
spent the day quietly receiving cailers.
He was in excellent health and spirits.
He expressed himself as being very much
pleased tnat the weather is bo generally
fair throughout the country, and declared
that he expected a very large vote would
be polled everywhere. The candidate is
confident of success.
Telegrams of the most encouraginc na
ture poured into the McKinley residence
over the special wires during the day, and
there were repeated calls for Major Mc-
Kinley over the long-distance telephones.
The candidate himself made no predic
tions and claimed nothing. The arrange
ments for the reception of election returns
at the McKinley resid' nee have been com
pleted. Half a dozen telegraph operators
have been provided for, and the candidate
received the msws in his library sur
rounded by a large number of his persona!
friends. Mrs. McKinley was very much
improved this morning, and she was able
to sit up while the news of the election
was beins; received this evening.
The Young Men's Sound-money Ciub
started otrt at 6 o'clock this morning,
headed by the Grand Army band, to make
a tour of all the precincts of the city.
They escorted their members to their re
spective voting places and were joined by
large numbers of Republicans everywhere
until the parade assumed large propor
tions. After all the members had voteit
the cl b marched up to the candidate's
home and serenaded him. No speeches
were made.
AT McKINLEY'S HOME.
Scenes of Rejo'clnar While the Clad
N^ws Is C ming.
CANTON. Ohio. Nov. 3.â Mnjor Mc-
Kinley received returns in various parts
of the house. Early in the evening he sat
in his study, where he heard the news of
hi;- nomination. After dinner he moved
into the dining-room and sat in an arm
chair near the I cad of the table, which
had been converted into a desk for the
filing of returns. Major McKinley heanl
the news with his usual calm. He sat
quietly while the news of battle came in
and sruoked his afternoon cigar. He be
came inU-rested as the news became more
copious, and kept up a running comment
on the sirnificance of the reports.
Major McKinley is uncommonly well
informed in practical politics, and carries
in his mind the salient results for several
years back in all important States. Mr.
McKinley's inlormation was piven up to
newspaper correspondents, and the re
turns were road aloud to them after they
Had been scanned hy the major. At the
long table at which the major sat were
Judg.^ Day, Judge Baldwin, Charles Mil
ler. Major Manchester, Mijor McKinley's
pastor and the correspondents of the
Press Associations.
When the United Associated Presses bul
letins announced that the Journal had
conceded the election of McKinley a
cheer swept through the house and Major
McKinley's face was slightly flushed. His
friends crowd d about him and pressed
upon him theircongratulatioiis.bin Majir
McKinlev refused to take anything for
granted, and Â«aid he would not assume he
was elected until the actual returns and
figures warranted it. He declined to let
telegrams of congratulation be sent out by
the newspapers till ha felt absolutely cer
tain of his election, for the reason that he
did not want the r.enders of the congratu
latory messages to feel embarrassed in
case he happened to be defeated.
At midnight bells sounded and bands
hastened to the public square, and in ten
minutes there were assembled thousands
of jubilant people, who united in singing
'â¢Praise God, From Whom All Blessings
Flow."
Major McKinley received the following
telegram from Paterson:
"Congratulations with all my heart.
Glorious achievement under your magnifi
cent leadership. The manhood of the
Republic has asserted itself and the Na
tion's honor and integrity will never again
be assailed by the same forces. Mrs. Ho
bart joins me in congratulations.
'â¢Garret A. Hobart.''
Levl P. Morton wires: "At 9 o'clock,
from returns received, I feel warranted in
extending my heartiest congratulations on
your triumphant election to the Presi
dency of the United States. New York
State ratifies the verdict by giving you a
plurality of at least a quarter of a million."
Every bulletin announcing the defeat of
Altgeld was heartily applauded, and the
news that McKinley had carried Nebraska
was loudly cheered by the people about
McKinley's bouse.
At midnight all of the marching clubs
of Canton, headed by a firing squad from
one of the militia companies, and followed
by 5000 yelling citizens with tin horns,
drums and pistols, descended like an in
vading army on Major McKinley's resi
dence. Several volleys were tired, and the
r.ciee from the shouting enthusiasts almost
drowned the report of the rifles.
Mrs. McKinley, who bad been confined
' to her bed lor a week, sat up to-night for
the first time. She had a dozen ladies
with her. Mother McKinley, Miss Mabel
McKinley, Mrs. Henry O. Heisland, Mrs.
W. R. Day, Mrs. George B. Frease, Miss
Eva Phillips were among the ladies who
heard the news with Mrs. McKinley.
Little Mary Colby, a child of unusal talent
as an entertainer and a niece of Mrs.
Heisland, Mrs. McKinley's nearest friend,
sang, played, recited and danced at
various times during the evening for Mrs.
McKinley and her guests. Major McKin
ley went from time to time, indeed, witb
a great deal of frequency, into the draw
ing-room to chat with bis wife and
mother and the other ladies. He was in
excellent spirits throughout tbe evening
and occasionally hummed to himself
"There Is a Land That Is Fairer Than
Day." Wuen Major McKinley is feeling
in excellent spirits he often bums a few
line-" of a hymn to himself.
"I do not get unduly excited," said Ma
jor McKinley when some one said to him,
"Major, you seem to have a tranquil look
on your face."
Major McKinley did not seem to take
very much pleasure in the premature con
grutulations.
"Very good, very pood," said Major Mc-
K.nley when tbe declaration of the Re
publican State Central Committee was
read announcing a sweeping victory in
tbe State and the defeat of Altgeld.
Chairman Harms wires tbe following
from Cleveland: "The feeling here beg
gars description. The boys at Union
Club send love and hearty congratula
tions. I will not attempt bulletins. You
are elected to tbe highest office of tbe land
by a people who have always loved and
trusted you."
C. W. Fairbanks of Indianapolis wires
Major McKinley as follows: "Returns
thus far indicate you have carried Indiana
by 35,000."
NJÂ£W YORK, N. V., Nov. 3-9 p. *.-
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 4, 1896.
N. B. Scott sent the lollowing to Garret A.
Hobart:
"I congratulate yon upon your election
as Vice-President of the United BtÂ»tes. I
predict that you will fill that position with
as great ability and dignity as any Vice-
President who has ever filled the chair.
From the bottom of my heart I congratu
late you."
REJOICING AT CANTON.
Major McKinley Overwhelmed With
Congratulations.
CANTON, Ohio, Nov. 4.â At midnight,
and not a second before, Major McKinley
admitted publicly that he felt assured of
his election. He made no announcement
of the fact that he believed he bad been
chosen to the highest office in tbe land,
but he allowed his friends to congratulate
bim when they pressed about him. They
offered him congratulations early in the
evening, but he eently put aside the pleas
ant words and insisted that he could not
accept congratulations till the news seemed
decisive. Major McKinley made no decla
ration of any sort; he merely received the
congratulations and thanked his friends
for their good wishes. He did not discuss
the victory or its significance. When the
clubs of Canton marched up to Major Mc-
Kinley 's house he stepped out on the ver
anda and reviewed tbe parade. Tne cheer
inc was deafening.
Tbe first out-of-town delegation to reach
the McKinley residence was one of 300
from Massillon, which arrived shortly after
midnight tnis (Wednesday) morning.
Telegrams of congratulation are pouring
in from all partsof the country.
The Massillon delegation and Canton
people continued their shouting for half
an hour, and were continually re-enforced.
At 1 o'clock it was estimated that there
were 25,000 people gathered in the vicinity
of the McKinley home.
MANLEY CONGRATULATES.
Touching Telegrams Sent to Mc-
Kinley and Hobart.
NEW YORK, N. V.. Nov. 3.â Joseph H.
Mauley has sent these telegrams:
"Hon. William McKinley. Canton: Ac
cept my earnest congratulations on your
triumphant election. You have, by your
matchless campaign, inspired the Ameri
can people, who have declared for honor,
for country, for honest money, for protec
tion and for the right."
Garrett A. Hobarl: I congratulate you
wi:h ail my heart. You are triumph
antly elected. It is a landslide. Give to
Mrs. Hobart and Junior my love."
Hon. 3/. A. Hanna, Union Club, Cleve
'an<l: I congratulate you witb all my
heart. You have been a great leader in a
great cau*e. The people can never repay
you the debt they owe you. It is a land
slide."
SPECTACULAR AS USUAL.
With a Flourish and Brass Band
Bryan Casts His Ballot.
LINCOLN, Nebb., Nov. 3.â As William
J. Bryan sat in the public dining-room of
tho Paxton House, Omaha, this morning,
eating his breakfast in company with
Mrs. Bryan, be did not look liKe a man
with an anxious mind. He slept well last
night, after the fatigues of his final day of
campaigning, and was up at 7 o'clock.
His bre:\Kfast was of the heartiest; his ap
pearance bright and rigorous. Mr. and
Mr?. Bryan drove in a carriage from the
Paxton through the chill, damp atmos
phere, suggestive of snow, to the Uniou
depot, where the candidate bought tickets
lor Mrs. Bryan and him-elf, shook bends
with a few people who recognized him,
and went aboard the Burlington train,
leaving Omaba for Lincoln at 8:30 o'clock.
Mrs. Bryan carried a box of flowers pre
sented at one of the nienting- last night,
while the candidate bore a bundle of sou
venirs. They took seats in the regular
chair car of the train. No incidents oc
curred on the journey to Lincoln, which
was reached at 10:15 o'clock.
A brass band played "Home, Sweet
Home," at the Lincoln station as the can
didate stepped from the train and the
membsrs of the Traveling Men's Silver
Ciub and the Bryan Home Guards cheered
lustily as he passed through the double
line they h&d formed. The band started
ahead piping a lively air, the organization
formed a guard of honor around Mr.
Bryan's carriage, and in this order he was
escorted to the City Clerk's office to swear
in his vote. The swearing in process took
a moment only. Mr. Bryan mounted the
stairway to the City Clerk's office briskly,
averred that he had no opportunity to get
registered, was a duly qualified voter and
all the rest of the necessary formula, and
after getting his certificate took his place
in the procession again.
The voting place for the precinct of
the Fifth Ward was in a fire-engine house
on F street, near Fourteenth. Mr. Bryan
entered it through the double line of
those who took part in the parade, and
after having his registration certificate in
spected went into one of the uncurtained
booths. During the eight minutes he
took in preparing his ballots, a dispute be
tween two opposing cbailengers caused
some loud talk, but nothing darkened the
interior of the engine-house as Mr. Bryan
handed the folded ballot sheets to Chap
lain Howe. A photographer took a flash
light picture of tne interesting incident.
Again under escort of the band and the
clubs, Mr. Bryan was taken to his home
on D street. The crowd cheered as he
ascended the steps of the dwelling, and
turning to the gathering the candidate
made a little speech of thanks.
"Ladies and gentlemen," he said, "I
have now done all I can to secure success
in this campaign, and for me there is
nothing left but to await the returns. I
want to thank the good friends who have
been so kind and courteous in my leaving
and in my returning, and whatever may
be the result of tnis campaign, I nhall al
ways be able to say that my neighbors
who agreed with me in political convic
tions did everything in their power to
insure success at this election.
"I ask you now to manifest your further
interest by (riving so much of the re
mainder of this day as you can to getting
the vote out and to seeing to it that every
one understands the form of ba lot so
that no mistake will be made. You'un
derstand that in this State, when they
allowed the bolting Democrats to go on as
Democrats, they did it in order to per
petrate v fraud ur on the voters of this
State. [Cries of 'That's right' and hisses.]
It is the duty of all our people to defeat
the fraud if they can by having people
understand just how the ballot reads, so
that each person can vote intelligently.
All that v p have asked in this campaign
is that eac.i citizen might be allowed to
vote as be plea?*- , and when that is done
we shall all abide the result, whatever it
may be."
The organizations cheered with a will
and disbanded as Mr. Bryan entered bis
house.
BRYAN GETS BAD NEWS.
Over His Own Wires He Receives
Reports of Defeat.
LINCOLN, Nzbr., Nov. 3.â Mr. Bryan
received returns in his house. Two Postal
Telegraph wire* bad been run into the
Bryan residence, one connected with
Democratic headquarters in Chicago and
the other for bulletins. Both instruments,
an operator at each, were placed in the
library, while in tbe adjoining room a
Western Union operator received the
bulletins furnished by that company.
It was understood among the friends of
Mr. Bryan that he was to be left alone on
election night, and as a consequence none
of the local supporters or neighbors of the
candidate gathered: at tbe little G-street
residence. After supper Mr. Bryan put
on a velvet nouse- jacket and went upstairs
to the private office he has established
since his nomination.
Mrs. Bryan remained with him during
the evening, husband and wife receiving
the bulletins fresh from tbe wire and read
ing and comparing them together. Mr.
Schwind, the candidate's secretary, and
a dozen newspaper men occupied the
library. The wire connecting with Demo
cratic headquarters was idle nearly all the
time. A lew dispatches for Mr. Bryan
came from Chairman Jones early in the
evening. Their purport was not made
known by Mr. Bryan, but he said that if
anything important was received from the
Arkansas Senator he would give it to the
press.
Chairman Dahlman of the Democratic
State Central Committee has sent a mes
sage to Mr. Bryan, saying that he had car
ried Nebraska by 15,000 and that the indi
cations point to the election of the entire
State ticket.
AND CROVER IS GLAD.
With Members of the Cabinet He
Is Pleased With Bryan's Defeat.
WASHINGTON, D. C. Nov. 3.â There
was no concealment of the gratification
caused by the election result among the
exclusive party that read tbe returns at
the White House upon the President's in
vitation.
Secretaries Olney, Carlisle, Morton, La
mont and Wilson, the two latter having
voted respectively in New York and West
Virginia and hastened back to the city,
shared with the President the full enjoy
ment of the United Associated Presses'
bulletins, whicli from the first, as one of
the Cabinet officers declared, were "all
our way."
The President took an unusually deep
interest in the returns, and was glad to
find bis confidence in the outcome fully
confirmed.
BY A MILLION VOTES.
Chairman Hani a Says McKinley
Will Have That P.urallty.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Nov. 3.â"McKin
ley wilt carry the country by a plurality of
1,000,000," was the startling statement
made by Chairman M. A. Hanna to a
United Associated Presses representative
at 10:10 p. m. in the parlors of the Union
Ciub.
"Yes, the result has exceeded even my
most saneuine expectations," continued
Mr. Hanna. "I had thought we might
not carry Kentucky unl Tennessee, but
those States have fallen into line nobly.
On the Pacific Coast we have rolled up
magnificent Republican majorities. We
have achieved a signal victory in Ne
braska."
'â¢What is the cause of this overwhelming
Republican triumph?"
"Why, this campaign has set the people
to thinking, and the result is a healthy
dcs re for a change of conditions which
will bring a renewed prosperity to the in
dustrial classes. Then the free trade ?.nd
free silver planks in tbe Democratic plat
form became hopelessly entangled with
each other, and this prevented a clear un
derstanding of tbe*e issues even by their
earnest supporters. The vital issues of
this campaign have been so cogently and
logically pointed out by the Republican
speakers that the judgment of the masses
cannot go far amiss."
"What is the significance of the result?"
"My dear sir, it cannot have but one
significance. It means the triumphant
vindication of Republican principles and
an honest currency."
THIS IS A LANDSLIDE.
Perry Heath Tells of the Sweeping
Victory of Repub Icanlsm.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 3.â The
United Associated Presses has received
the following telegram from Perry Heath,
wo has been closely associated with
Chairman Hanna in tbe management of
tbe campaign :
"United Associated Presses, Washington:
At 9 o'clock to-night returns salely verify
Chairman Hanna's statement that Mc-
Kinley and Hobart will have at least 311
votes in tbe electoral college. This is a
landslide. There is no doubt about Oregon
being for McKinley, while the chances
favor our having secured California and
Washington. We have carried Kentucky,
West Virginia, North Carolina and be
lieve we have Tennessee. We are certain
of every State east of Colorado and north
of the Ohio River. An important feature
of the indications at this time is that there
will be a straightout, reliable sound
money Republican majority in the Sen
ate. We are certain to have sound-money
Republican Senators succeed Hill of New
York, Cameron of Pennsylvania, Voor
hees of Indiana, Blackburn of Kentucky,
Palmer of Illinois, Vilas of Wisconsin,
Peffer of Kansas and Kyle of South Da
kota. There are now thirteen silver ma
jority in the Senate. Indications are that
sound-money Senators will have a ma
jority of at least three."
IN NO UNCERTAIN WAY.
Chairman Payne Congratulates
Hobart on Bryanlsm's Defeat.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 3. â Chairman
Payne claims for the Republican ticket all
the New England States, Maryland, Dela
ware, West Virginia, Obio. North Caro
lina, Virginia, Indiana, Minnesota, Wis
consin, North Dakota, South Dakota,
lowa, Nebraska, Kansas, Wyoming,
Oregon and California. Mr. Payne sent
tbe following message:
"Garret A. Hobart. Paterson: The
great Central West vies with the East in
showing its detestat on of the doctrines
enunciated at Chicago. All good citizens
bere are rejoicing at the overwhelming
defeat of Bryanism and Tillmanism. Mar
we hear no more their voices over the
land, seeking to incite discontent. Our
people have shown that they are capable
o: self-government, and have rebuked the
demagogues in no uncertain terms. We
have won this great victory by the efforts
of good citizens regardless of previous
party affiliations. Much will be expected
and much will be realized from this mag
nificent result."
JONES YET HOLDS OUT.
Hoping That Later Returns Will Ba
More Favorable for Bryan.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 4.â Chairman
Jones of the Democratic National Com
mittee shortly before midnight gave out
the following:
"There is no foundation for the claims
of the Republicans. There Is at this time
no reason to think that any one of the
Btates claimed by me for Mr. Bryan has
failed to vote for t.im. While misleading
reports are being sent iv ail directions,
private advices assure us that each one of
these States has gone for Mr. Bryan. For
two hours the most extravagant claims as
to Kentucky and Indiana have been tele
graphed all over the country, while within
the last few minutes our committees as*
sure us that both States are safe for us.
Mr. Bryan is certainly elected.
"We have received no unfavorable re
ports from any State we have claimed ex
cept Kentucky. We can afford to lose
Kentucky and still have enough electoral
votes to win."
To this was added by E. W. Barrett of
the literary bureau: "We have just re
ceived a message from the chairman of
the State Central Committee cf Indiana to
the effect that Indiana is absolutely safe
for BrÂ£an."
Allen W. Clark, secretary of the State
Committee of Indiana, telephoned: "Sixty*
five Indianapolis precincts heard from
show an average Republican gain of eleven
to a precinct. Fifteen country precincts
heard from show a Democratic gain of
about forty to each precinct. I believe the
Democrats have carried the State. Ido
not expect returns from country districts
until late." Governor Matthews con
curred in this view.
Tne Democratic National Committee also
claims California by 25.000 plurality ; Ne
braska, Michigan, Kentucky and Oregon.
The early reports, it was stated, were ex
pected to show adverse majorities.
From Ohio the committee reports tne
receipt of singularly favorable reports
from Toledo and Cleveland, but not so en
couraging from Cincinnati. The commit
tee does not expect full reports from the
doubtlui States for two or three days.
BRECKINRIDGE'S ANGER.
It Causes Him to Encounter a
Newspaper Man.
LEXINGTON. Ky., Nov. 3.â Colonel
BrecK. image and Pat Farnsworth, a news
paper man, had a row this afternoon.
Breckinridge spoke to a number of gentle
men standing near the polls and some one
remarked ibat had not bis name been un
der the log cabin he would have voted for
the Colonel. The others, among whom
was Farnsworth, applauded. Colonel
Breckinridge, pointing to Farnsworth, re
minded him of a pledge. A quarrel en
sued, during which Breckinridge called
Farnsworth a liar and farnsworth re
torled with a lie. Breckinridge started at
Farnsworth and tbe latter made a lunee
at the Colonel. Tiey were prevented from
doing each other personal violence.
Colonel Brecicinridge drew a revolver
when several Silverites gathered around
bim in a threatening manner, but the
crowd scattered on sight of the weapon.
BrecklnrldKe Defeated.
LOUISVILLE, Ky., Nov. 4.â lt seems
almost certain that Settle, free-silver
Democrat, has defeated Breckinridge in
the Seventh District.
Tlllman Yet Defiant.
CHICAGO. 111., Nov. 3.â Senator Till
man said late to-night that while he did
not concede McKinley's election, the re
turns certainly pointed that way. "If
McKinley wins," said the Senator, "the
political agitation will still go on. It can
no more be stopped than the agitation
which resulted in the emancipation of tbe
slaves. "
Only One In New Encland.
NEW YORK. N. V., Nov. 4.-The Times

Democrat elected to Congress in New Eng
land. It atso gives McKinley 6000 plural

50,000 in Maine, 15.000 in Rhode Island
and 30,000 in Connecticut.
AS VIEWED IN PARIS.
Grave Controversies Decided by
the American Election.
PARIS, France. Nov. 3.â The Temps
In its issue this morning devoted a lead
ing editorial on the Presidential election
in the United States, in which it says:
When the sun seti to-day the great Republic
will have decided one of the gravest con
troversies that hns agitated that country ilnce
the foundation of the Government, and the
electors will have .pronounced between two
radically opposed tendencies â one continuing
the normal development of the States and the
other Impelling the country toward unknown
horizons. Briefly, as between McKinley and
Bryan, the solution is simply a status quo or
revolution. It U the first time in America,
and perhaps the firj^ime in the world, that a
like contest ha* been engaged in upon ques
tions lying upon tbe foundations of social
order with tne issue depending upon a single
throw of the dice.
The Matin says: Europeans expect
nothing from tbe triumph of one candi
date or the other. ' With Mr. Bryan we are
exposed to the consequences of free trade,
and with McKinley we are confronted
with the tariff restrictions.
Tbe Figaro says: The triumph of the
silverites will mean that European
holders of American securities will receive
for their coupons paper based upon silver
wortti in money only 50 per cent of what
they should receive, and America wll
appropriate from all of her creditors half
of their holdings.

;A- Triple Fusion Ctuid Not Swing
This State Away From the
Republican Party.
Against the odds of the fusion of Demo
crats, Populists and si:verites, California
has remained true to the principles that
alone can insure her prosperity.
Returns from 573 precincts outside of
fan Francisco *.-ive McKinley a plurality
of nearly 3000, while the count in this City
thus far indicates a McKinley plurality of
at least 3000.
.' The Golden State may therefore be
.counted in the great roll of Republican
States which have achieved a triumph so
s signal and impressive in tbe cause of
â¢sound money and protection. The plu
ralWy will range from 5000 to 10,000.
â Â±'he Republicans are certain of the elec
tion of four Concressmen, and later re
turns will probably increase the number
to five. The doubt is in the case of Me
. Lachlan, who is hard pressed by Barlow,
the Populist.
In the Fourth District James G. Ma
guire wins by about 10,000 majority, and
in the Second District Johnson is undoubt
edly defeated by De Vries, making the
Democrats certain of two Representatives.
The Senator from Caliiornia who will be
elected at the expiration of the present
term of Senator Perfcins will be a Repub
lican, as the returns indicate a safe
majority in both houses of tbe State
Legislature.
Under the adverse circumstances Cali
fornia has done herself proud.

MARIN.
SAN RAFAEL, Cal.. Nov. 3.â Marin
County is thoroughly redeemed. For the
first time in many years the Republicans
have stood shoulder to shoulder foi their
entire ticket and the majorities for the
National and legislative nominees are
fully double what was expected and dou
ble the majority given to any ticket for a
long time.
San Rafael gives 19 Republican majority,
the first time it has gone Republican since
Blame ran. Every man on the Republi
can- ticket is elected, from Presidential
electors to Supervisors. There will be but
one Democrat on the new Board of Super
visors, and he holds over. The silver vote
Eeems to have produced no effect, except
to rwell the Republican vote by the acces
sion of a goodly number of sound
money Democrats.
Barham's majority will be 450 to 500.
General Dickinson will have about 600
majority.
The Republican County Committee

SACRAMENTO, Cal., Nov. 3.â The elec

been bear;! from, are an entire surprise to
the knowing ones of both parties. Grove
L. Johnson, who was conceded a majority
of from 2000 to 4000 by men of both parties,
has so far obtained but 1050 majority over
his opponent from Stockton, and his de
feat is certain.
Sims and Ennis, Republican Assembly
men from the Twentieth ana Twenty-first
districts, whose defeat was conceded, have
both won victories, and Lovdal, Republi
can Assemblyman from the Twenty-sec
ond District, may yet snatch a victory
from his opponent, as sev -ral large pre
cincts are still to be heard from.
The Superior Judg?sbips have not cre
ated qnite so much surprise, as for several
days Hughes and Johnson, Democratic
candidates, have been conceded a walk
over, with Hart R. a good third.
In the contest for .State Senator Doty
D. has always been conceded a victor, even
by some of Brusie's(R.) stanchest friends.
As lar as has been heard from the county
has a majority for the head of the Repub

All night long the street in front of the
Record-Union office has been crowded by
thousands who have been watching tbe

BUT lE.
CHICO, Cal., Nov. 3.â 01 d Butte will
sustain tbe record of the Republican party
and will roll up a good majority for Mc-
Kinley. This is a sore disappointment to
the Democrats, for it was estimated tbat
the Populisti would, in combining with
the Democrats, snow under the Republi
cans completely. Chico bas gone solidly
Republican, tbe vote for Johnson and D-
Vries being a scratch, Johnson receiving
437 and De Vries 438.
Stai.Heli (R.), for the Assembly, de
>aÂ»eÂ«l Thresher (D.) by 500 votes. Gray
(R.), for the Superior Cour*. beat Lon*,
(D.) by over 1000. The Democrats will un
doubtedly elect one Supervisor. This
county will give De Vries a small majority
ovr Johnson.
Tii main fight in the county was for
Congressman, Assemblyman and Superior
Judge. â¢
The candidates for Assembly and Judge
on the Republican ticket had a walkover
and carried the field by an unexpected ma
jority. The mountain precincts not yet
heard from will be in favor of tbe Repub
licans and increase their vote stiil more.
The Republicans are jubilant, while the
Democrats have very lit: le to say, but look
a ood deal paler tnau their would-be sil
ver.

for the Assembly from the outside dis

offices of Superior Judge.
The greatest vote was polled for Marion
De Vries for Congress. In only two pre

the other parts of the county there was a
regular stampede for the Stockton boy.

and every indication points to his election
in this district.

SIXTH DISTRICT.
LOS ANGELES.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Nov. 4.â The
splendid victory which now seems assured
to tbe Republican* of the United States
has set the Republicans of tbiscity a most
beside themselves with delight. Every
conceivable device bas been made use of
toswÂ«l the gad clamor of victory in be
half of McKmiey, sound money, peace,
protection and prosperity.
Everybody is up and about the streets
at a late hour receiving and giving con
gratulations. Old and young, male and
female, are in the general mixup. and
there seems little inclination to quit the
bulletin boards.
While it is impossible to give exact
figures on the Le islaiive vote to-night,
enough is known to suaranteethe election
of 'our out of six Republicans.
The Republican candidates for City
Justices have al.-o been elected by hand
some majorities. It fact, it may be said
that the Republican party bas swept the
field where there was any possible show to
elect its candidates.
The Democrats claim that the Bryan
electors have carried the city and this may
be true, but the couniy is safely Republi
can by from 1500 to 2400.
McLachlnn's majority will be small, and
later and fuller returns may possibly de
feat him, but so far be is ahead, with pros
pects of being a winner. He ran behind
the McKinley electors in nearly every pre
cinct iv the county. Likewise, Barlow has
run behind the Bryan electors by a still
greater difference, making a very peculiar
situation.
For some inexplicable cause the local
count is extremely slow, notwithstanding
the ballots were short. The suffrage
amendment seems to have carried in the
county, but tbe majority in its favor will
be small. The returns on tbe other amend
ments are too meager to form anything
like an accurate basis for an estimate up
to 2 a. m.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Nov. 3.â Three
hundred and seventy-e'ght precincts are
three to one for McKinley.
POMONA, Cal., Nov. 3.â The vote half
counted gives McKinley 123 majority *>o
far; McLaugblin (R.) for State Senator,
113; Vusburg (R.) for Assemblyman, 118.
The city wiil easily give 200 Republican
majority.
SANTA MONICA, Cal., Not. 3â Mo-
Kinley 286. Hryan 248; McLachlan, R.,
for Congress 237; Barlow, F., 246.
LOS ANGELES, Cal . Nov. 3.âSeventy
one precincts give McKinley a majority
of 1431. It this ratio is kept up he will re
ceive from 4000 to 5000 majority in the
county. At least 2500 majority is ex
pected. ' .-" '. ':â ' â

FRESNO.
FRESNO, Cal., Nov. 3.â The election
passed off very quietly in this city and
county. Much interest was taken and a
good vote generally was polled, but the
interest was of a peaceable sort and not a
fracas has been reported from any pre
cinct. The county undoubtedly will give
a majority 01* several hundred for Bryan,
but the majority is lighter than had been
anticipated. The Silver Republican vote
was hardly in evidence, it bein more than
offset by the middle-of-the-road Populist
vote.
Castle, the fusion nominee for Congress,
has run behind his ticket, and Bowers
wili have a comfortable majority in
Fresno County. The fusionlsts elect Cart
wright and Moultrie for the Assembly,
the former being a Populist and the latter
a Democrat.
In the Supervisoral contest it is prob
able tbat the Republicans elect one, tbe
Democrats one and tbe Populists one,
there having been n> fusion on this office.
Complete returns, how ver, will be re
quired to finally decide who has been
elected. Tbe first constitutional amend
ment is snowed under by ballots both in
the city and county, while a fair majority
of the voters favor extending suffrage to
women.
To-night the town is owned by the Re
publicans, w o in view of Eastern returns
are jubilant. The fusionists have gone to
bed.
In the forty heaviest precincts of the
countethe Republican electoral vote was
2130 ami the Fusion 2665, which is a fine
snowing for tbe Republicans. Bowers for
Congress leads Castle by 23 votes.
A. E. Smith R. is elected Supervisor in
the Third District by 68 majority and W.
P. Manly and W. R. Neil Pops, in the Sec
ond and Fifth districts. In twenty-seven
precincts the sixth amendment received
1729 votes and 1359 ag ainst.

SANTA BARBARA.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Nov. 3.â The
count of the city is not yet complete, but
only t:.e Fifth Ward remains, and as that
is strondy Repub ican the present major
ity of 200 will only swell the aggregate.
Tbe county is assured not only to Mc-
Kinley but to the entire Republican ticket
Carpinteria sends her greeting of an as
sured majority. The returns from the
upper end of th â  county are not yet com
plete, but enoush has been heard from to
make the Republican committe> conn
dent of a clean sweep. Jadge Walter B.
Cope, D., is re-elected by a larce majority,
J. J. Boyce is elected to the Senate and
Captain H.rris to the Assembly by over
200 majority.

returns of four precincts estimated, trive
Shepherd 100. Boyce will carry the dis
trict by 100 majority.
Santa Barbara County will give 120 ma
jority for Mi Kinley. He carries every
precinct but one in the city of Santa Bar
bara, and the city by 200. McLachlan

SEVENTH DISTRICT.
SAN DIEGO.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Nov. 3.â Returns
have been coming in slowly from tbe
county precincts, but enough have been
received to prove that tbe county has been
snatched from the fusion column and
placed in the Republican ranks.
Instead of giving the county to Bryan
by 500, as conceded by Republicans a week
ago, McKinley will get it by several hun
dred. Instead of giving the two Superior
Judgeships to Popocrats, Torrance (R. ) is
re-elected by 300 majority, and the other
Judge is doubtful between Hughes and
Shaw, fusionists. /
W. W. Bowers, Republican Congress
man, has received advices from all over
his district conveying congratulations
upon his re-election by a rousing majority
over Castle. Bowers will have close to
500 majority in this, his own county.
For Assemblyman Guy (R.) is re-elected
in tbe Eightieth Assembly District The
fight is close between Cox (R.) and Dryden
(Fusionist), with the chances favoring tbe
latter. The Republicans have captured
two of tbe three Supervisors, electing
Cherry and Swallow.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Nov. 3.â Twenty out
of 85 precincts of the county give McKin
ley 466, Bryan 432. The same in 1892 gave

SAN BERNARDINO.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., Nov. 3.â
The election in this city and county passed
off quietly and a large vote was polled.
Only partial returns have been received,
and the indications are that McKinley has
carried the county by 200 to 300 majority.
Bowers for Congress is running ahead of
the ticket, and will carry the county by a
good majority. Oster (R.) for Judge is
certainiy elected. Goff (R.) for Assembly
man is ruuning well, and is elected by 300
majority.
The vote for Jones (Republican) for
State Senator for the counties of San Ber
nardino, Orange and Riverside is up with
the ticket and he has certainly polled a ma
jority of the votes of the county. The
Republicans of this city are wild with joy
over the el ction of McKinley and Hobart,
which at this hour seems to be assured.
The Democrats and Populists are glum
and dejected.
ONTARIO, Cal., Nov. 3.â Precinct 2
gives McKinley 74, Bryan 48; Bowers R.

more. Mahon, D. and Pop. candidate
for Superior Judge, will have a fair ma
jority over Conklin R. Eramona F. and
Curran R. are runniug pretty even, can

OREGON.
PORTLAND, Or., Nov. 3. â The
heaviest vote in tbe history of the State
was polled to-day. The election in Port
laud was attended by scenes of great ex
citement. There were clashes between
Pennoyer policemen who were looking out
for the Bryan vote and special deputies
who looked after the other aide. Numer
ous arrests for illegal voting, repeating
and disturbances at polling places were
made, and among the number were eight
Italians who were arrested in a bunch.
Altogether there were twenty arrests. As
no registration provision is included in
the Oregon Australian ballot system there
was more or less illegal voting.
The predictions of the Republican
leaders that McKinley would carry Ore
gon seem to be verified at this hour.
Sound money carries the city and county
by 2 to 1.
Scattering returns from six counties
give no satisfactory results upon which an
estimate may be placed. The Populist
vote for Bryan shows a slight gain over
the vote for Populist Congressmen last
June. Returns from the State to-nigbt
are slow coming in. At Bryan head
quarters nothing is conceded on the State.
The chairman insists that Bryan will
have 4500 outside of Portland.
The city is wild with excitement to
night. Thousands of men and women are
marching to and fro in the drizzling rain,
watching tbe returns. Bands are out
playing and the greatest enthusiasm pre
vails over the announcement of tbe re
sults in the East. It is believed McKin
luy's majority la safe against any cain of
Bryan in the interior, as returns show a
great increase over the estimate of party
managers.

FREAK ELECTION BETS.
All Sorts of Ridiculous Things to
Be Done by Losers.
LONDON, Exg., Nov. 3.â lt is estimated
that $500,000 in beta has been placed in
London on the result of the election in
tbe United States. Colonel Wilson of
Chicago made a wager of $1000 evea to
day that McKinley would be elected. The
bet was taken by F. C. Fulton, a Chicago
Bryanite. Besides the ordinary election
bet there has been considerable freak bet
ting. General Morgan, a Brooklyn sil
verite, made a bet in which he engaged
in the event of Bryan's defeat to have all
his teeth drawn, in tbe event of McKin
ley's defeat, his opponents, four in num
ber, agree to have their beards and mus
taches shaved off. Tbe parties to the bet
are under a penalty of $500 each in case of
failure to fulfill the terms of the bet.
Articles have been signed and witnessed
to that effect.

President Roberts is to baptize Pettillo and
Pettillo is to forever renounce the Republican
party and the devil. The baptizing is to take
place on Petit Jean River at Rocky Crossing
on the second Saiurday In November, 1896, at
2 o'clock p. m., or as soon afterward as tho
Presidential election may be definitely settled.
The public is cordially invited to be present.

drive him around the square and then
down Dickson street to the depot. Then
he is to fasten him to a post and give him

His Cabin.
WALLACE, Idaho, Nov. 3.â At Burke,
Idaho, in a cabin near the lower end of
the town, a dynamite explosion occurred
yesterday, resulting in one d*ath, Thomas
Corlett being blown into small fragments.
â¢ When the men rushed into the cabin, at
tracted by the sound of the explosion, a
howible sight greeted them. The body and
legs of Corlett lay near a window, while
.small pieces of human flesh were strewn
all ove"r the inside of the wrecked building.
, Coroner Herrington held an inquest, but
the'eatise of the explosion was a complete
mystery. No reason for suicide beinc
â¢known, it is supposed to have been ncci
. dental, as Conett was known to keep giant
powder in the cabin. Evidently he was
'standing near a window not far from the
powder nhen the explosion occurred, the
body being worse mutilated tbaa tbe

THE EMPORIUM
I
A WEDDING TOUR
RUDELY ENCED
The Bride of a Month
Tires of Marital
. Bliss.
Howard Fairfield Is Searching
Portland for His Runaway
Spouse.
LEFT HER MON^Y AND JEWELS
Religious Diff'rences and T mporary
Insanity Thought to Have Led
to tbe Desertion.
PORTLAND, Or , Nov. 3.â An uncom
monly strange case of desertion by a wife
was brought to liiÂ»nt last nisut by the
arrival here of Howard Fairfietd from
Seattle in search of his bride, whom he
married in Baltimore, Md., less than a
month ago.
Mr. Fairfield belongs to a wealthy family
in Louisville, Ky., and he first met his
wife at the Cuicago World's Pair in the
company of mutual friends. The if'air
fields were on a wedding trip, purposing
to pass their honeymoon on the Pacific
Slope. They reached Seattle last Friday,
putting up at one of the principal hotels
and intending to take in this city on their
way to San Francisco.
Last Saturday afternoon Mrs. Fairfield
was seized with a fit of distressing melan
cholia, during which her husband was
called from the hotel on business. On his
return he found a note on his private par
lor table from his wifp, saying in a few
brief words that she was wearied of mar
ried life and that she was going to visit a
friend in Portland, whence she would re
turn to her people. Tne young wife also
beseeched her husband not to pursue her,
as she never again would lira with him.
The only difference they ever had was
one of religion. Mrs. Fairfield was a most
devout Catholic up to a month before her
marriage, and then only after much per
suasion did she hesitatingly join her hus
band's church, the Baptist. Mr. Fairfield
now imagines that i> is bride's secret brood
ing over the abandonment of the faith to
which she to tenaciously clung to the last
moment must temporarily have unsettled
her reason. That she is alive he does not
doubt In bis own distressed state of mind
the unhappy husband said to the detective

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
Victory !
Now for business.
The agony is over.
Get ready for Thanksgiving.
No American kicks against the majority.
There will be another chance four years
from now.
The revival will come in with the holi
day trade.
Ihe campaign must give way now to the
Christmas novelty.
Whatever the American people do is all
right in this country.
It goes without saying to the wise mer
chant that now is the time to advertise.
Four months of Grover is tbe way it
Etancl? now and every day will lessen it.
One month rest from politics, and then
Congress meets and begins another ruc
tion.
It was not quite a unanimous vote, but
it was so nearly so that no one will dis
pute it.
It took three months of the campaign to
heat the people up, but they can cool off
in three days.
We can now pay attention to Europe
once more, and to the changing form of
tbe o!d war cloud.
Tne Cuban campaign still goes on, but
with brightening prospects that the pa
triots will carry the country.
. The party fight is over and this morn
ing we all unite as loyal Americans in do
ing honor to our next President.
Tne question to be discussed now is,
"What is to be tbe next best thing in the
way of California development?
There must be a good deal of crow eaten
this week, but Thanksgiving is coming
and then we will all have turkey.
Now that the crisis is over there is no
use criticizing the result. The thing has
happened and the country is safe.
All defeated candidates may draw satis
faction from the fact that this is a free
country, and they can try it again.
If you qnarreled with any of your
friends during the campaign now is the
time to make up and call it square.
Business is reviving, prices are rising,
gold is coming into the country, and pros
pects are bright for the workingman.
Let us hope we will never hear the cry
of coercion in another campaign. It
doesn't sound well from American lips.
But yesterday the boy orator was a
freak that made tbe biggest show on
earth, and now be is bnt an idle curiosity.
The fellows who stopped you before to
explain the money question will now stop
you to explain the meaning of the result.
There will be a grand whoop-up for the
victory, and after that people will begin to
take an interest in chrysanthemum shows.
The coming winter will be one of great
activity in California, and now is the time
to square away and make yourself a factor
in it.
The question of the day is not so much
what the Democrats will try next as
whether they will survive to try anything
at all.
Before long we will be getting reports
about what Cleveland is going to say in
his next message, but you needn't read
them.
There will never be another party in
this generation that will run its head
against the business sentiment of the
country.
It is clearly evident now that when tbe
American workingman asks for prosperity
he cannot be fooled witu an offer of fifty
cent dollars.
As the campaign canard fades away we
nut v expect to hear rumors that Cleveland
intends to recognize Cuba and start a war
with Spain.
A lady in Oakland declares a cataclysm
is coming, but a good many American
citizens believe this morning that it struck
the country yesterday.
It is a pity that New Year is not at
hand, for there are thousands of men this
morning who are ripe and ready to swear
off from the betting habit.
England in Egypt may sound like a dull
topic to talk about after the excitements
of the last two months, but it may bÂ« ex
citing itself before tbe winter is over.
According to a New York dramatic
critic there is in that city no such thing as
a moderate success for a play. If it does
not become tbe rage it does not succeed
at all. The critic also says, but that was
scarcely necessary, that good plays never
become the rage.
In 1497 Vasco da Gam a doubled the
Cape of Good Hope and Sebastian Cabot
discovered the coast of North A merica at
Labrador, and now Portugal Droposes to
celebrate tbe one event and Canada the
other, and you can take your choice which
one you wish to attend.
McKINLEY AND HOFART.
The people of the Unite i States may
congratulate themselves this morning.
Republicans and honest-money Demo
crats may be proud of the success
achieved by their union. A glorious
victory has been won for protection,
sound money and good government The
defeat of the agitators has been over
whelming. We shall not have a Bryanite
campaign again in this generation. Once
more the American people have proven
themselves to be the safest jury in the
world to which to submit questions of jus
tice and honor.
The victory for McKinley and Hobart
means so much to tbe American people
that it is hard to express it in a few words.
It means protection to American indus
tries and good wages to American work
ingmen. It means sound money and the
maintenance of the credit of the Nation
and its people. It means tbe enforcement
of law, the upholding of the powers of the
General Government and the preservation
of the Supreme Court as a temple of in
violate justice.
It means tbe defeat of mischief-making
agitators, of demagogues who appeal to
sectional passions and to class hatreds, of
the repudiators of honest debts, of the
violators of contracts, of the opponents of
tbe General Government, a:id of the slan
derers of the dignity of the Suprern*
Court. It means the overthrow of every
element that has threatened National
prosperity and National honor.
We can now look forward to the im
mediate return of better times. Cleve
landism has been rebuked and Bryanism
repudiated. There will be no more free
trade experiments, no more deficits, no
more increase of the National debt.no
more disasters in private business. There
will be no more cheap-money agitation,
no more resistance to National law, no
more threats of discord and industrial
disturbance.
With the assurance of the return to the
protective system, which will make
American industries profitable and pro
vide an adequate revenue for the Govern
ment, the money question will settle
itself. The Nation will no longer have
to run in debt to maintain the gold
reserve. Mills and factories will open
for American workingmen; good wages
will be paid in good money, and industry
and enterprise will once more receive
their reward. Never in our history have
great questions been so well settled as in
this case. Every danger luat seems to
have threatened the Republic or its people
has been met boldly and overcome.
Certainly all good citizens may con
gratulate one another this morning.
Every prospect of the time now promises
an immediate revival of prosperity. Se
cure of good legislation at Washington,
capitalists can at once put their
money into circulation and set about the
accomplishment of great undertaking?.
Men who have long been unemployed can
look forward to findine work lor their
energies within a comparatively short
time and every trade in the country may
reasonably expect an immediate improve
! meat of busiuess.
The best feature of the glorious result is
the manifestation that the appeal to sec
tional antagonisms and class hatreds has
been in vain. By the vote of yesterday
I the American people attest that they are
one in interest and sympathies as well as
one in patriotism. They have most
effectually rebuked those who have en
deavored to excite in them anything like
antagonism. They have shown by their
votes that they agree with McKinley and
stand for â¢'country first, country last and
country with stainless honorall the time."
CUBAN AFFAIRS.
According to a correspondent of the New
York Hemld. it is believed both in Havana
by tbe Spaniards and in Key West by
Cuban refugees that tbe departure of
Consul-General Lee for Washington was
caused by something like a crisis in the
relations of the United States and the Span
ish Government. If these reports are well
founded, it is more than likely that the
Cuban news will be about the most inter
esting that Americans will receive for
some time, and it is possible the coming
session of Congress may seethe conclusion
of this long protracted Cuban problem.
It is not known what course Mr. Cleve
land will pursue, nor even what course
will be recommended by the Consul-
General. This silence on the part of the
President may be due to a mere sullen
ness, or it may be ominous of a graver
crisis than has been supposed. We shall
probably have to wait for his message to
Congress, when it assembles in December,
before we learn clearly the true nature of
the case. It may be said, however, that
the people of the United States have fairly
made up their minds on the subject, and
that if the President should determine
upon the recognition of Cuba and active
measures of putting an end to the war he
would bare tbe hearty support of the great
majority of our citizens.
The Cuban war has been protracted too
long. It has been evident for some time
past that Spain could not govern the coun
try with peace and good order. She is not
strong tnough to enforce- her laws. The
continuance of her armies in the island
simply serves to continue war and all its
attendant evils. Cuba is so near to Amer
ica that we not only sympathize with its
people in their struggle for independence,
bnt we feel that in a certain sense we are
responsible for wiiat happens there.
If Spain is fighting merely to preserve
her honor, interference of the United
States would give her just cause for retir
ing from the field, and there would be no
loss of prestige to her if she did so. On
the otber band, if she is fighting merely
to exercise a military tyranny in the
island, certainly in the cause of human
ity we have a right to interfere.
No American desires a war with Spain,
nor do we desire to make an unwarrant
able interference in the affairs of another
nation. Mo Government has more hon
estly maintained international law than
has that of the United States during all
its History. It would seem, however, that
even international law would allow our
interference in this case, and certainly if
Consnl-General Lse in his report to the
President shows that any injustice has
been done to American citizens by the
Spanish Government, it would be the
duty, as well as the right, of the President
to put an end to what has become more
like a struggle for destruction and exter
mination against the Cuban people than a
civilized war to maintain a well-ordered
government.
It is an easy prediction that our new
Legislature will make things at Sacra
mento as lively as usual.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 4, 1896.
CALIFORNIA FOR M'KINLEY.
Ail reports from the State tend to show
that California is surely Republican. She
stands with all the great ptogressive com
monwealths of the Union for sound money
and protection. . She will cast her electoral
rote for McKinley and Hobart.
Indications are favorable for a large
majority of the Republican candidates for
Congress. The Legislature will be Re
publican, and a sound protectionist trill
be elected to the Senate. The victory, in
fact, seems far more complete than the
most sanguine hoped, and later returns
will probably add to its completeness.
The saving of California from the Popo
crat fusion is a matter of congratulation
to all pood citizens. We have had more
than our share of agitators and mischief
makers. Their disturbances have long
retarded the development of the
State and an industrial as well as a
political benefit will result from their over
throw. We cau, therefore, bail with a
double gladness the victory now assured.
California has put herself firmly on the
right side. She is for patriotism, protec
tion and prosperity.
A REPUBLICAN CONGRESS.
One of the best features of the news of
the election is tbe assurance it gives of a
Republican majority In both branches of
Congress. This assures to President Me-
Kiniey the support which he will need to
carry out his policy for the promotion of
the prosperity of the American people.
It seems clear from the returns that not
I only will the House have a strong Repub
i lican majority, but there will be in the
I Senate after the 4th of March a sufficient
! number of Republicans to support all ad-
I ministration measures over tbe combined
votes of Democrats, Populists and free
silverites. This will enable Congress and
j the next administration to carry out the
j great plans of a protective tariff, reci
procity treaties, internal improvements
and the upbuilding of the American mer
chant marine. We have needed these
things for a long time, and now that they
seem assured within the near future, it is
hard to set limits upon tne prosperity that
is in store fcr us.
It is pleasing to note that in this Re-
I publican majority the Southern States
' will have part. They will no longer be
. regarded as a section alien to trie rest of
j the Union. They will have strong and
j able representatives to act with the Re
i publicans in promoting their interests
j and industries and in providing for ineir j
. own welfare as well as that of the rest of
i the Union.
TaKen altogether, the assurance of a
I Republican Congress is hardly less grati
! fying than the assurance of a Republican
j President. The one is necessary to tbe
! other. If there had been lacking a Re
publican majority in either house the re
turn of good legislation and of good times
resulting from it might have been long
postponed, but now we may count on its
speedy occurrence.
NOW FOR BUSINESS.
The election is over. The Jong, hard
i struggle of one party against thl other is
i ended. We can now turn irom talking of
' money to making money and give our
I thoughts and energies to industry instead
i of politics.
As we turn our eyes in this new direc
tion we are greeted everywhere with bright
1 prospects. Business generally revives after
j Presidential elections ana this year the re
i vival promises to be prompter and more
, universal than we have known for a long
! time.
Tbe rise in the price of wheat and cot
ton carries cheer to both the great sections
of tbe Union and gives an increased activ
ity in trade to all lines of business. Gold
| is rapidly flowing into tbe country and
i money rates will in all probability be
1 much easier than they have be en since tbe
: great panic.
In addition to these features of the busi
ness world, which would be encouraging
at ail times, we have also the stimulus of
the coming holiday trade. The shop win
dows along tbe principal streets are al
ready brightening up with the glow of
Christmas goods, in a few weeks they will
be radiant. A more cheerful as well as a
more active life will soon flow through all
the channels of trade, and everybody will
feel the glow of the coming of better
times.
The beginning of this new era of trade
activity meanj_ji great deal for California.
The coming decade should be one of im
mense development in all parts of the
State. Let us square away and make
ready to take part in it. The last echoes
of the <;reat political struggle will soon die
away and be lost in the rising hum of in
dustry, and let us hope that every home
in California and in tbe Un'on will derive
some benefit from the renewed activity of
capital and labor.
HONEST MONEY DEMOCRATS.
In this Republican triumph due credit
should be given to honest-money Demo
crat?. While many of them voted for
Palmer md Buckner there is reason for
believing that the great majority cast a
straight vote for Republican electors and
Republican Congressmen. It is certainly
to the vote of these men that we owe
much of the Republican success which has
been attained in the Southern States.
It is not too much to say that there ia a
reasonable hope that all these Democrats
who voted for McKinley in the Bouth will
remain hereafter in the Republican col
umn. They have given in this campaign
abundant evidence that they stand for
sound money, protection and the consti
tution, and as the Republican party will
continue to guard these against the as
saults of combined Populism and Democ
racy these conservative Democrats will
have no rightful place in our politics ex
cept in Republican rank-.
It seems aafe to say from the returns
that bave come to us that tbe Republican
party has entered upon a new lease of
power and will maintain it for the rest of
this generation. Our politics in the future
will'te largely concerned with economic
questions, and on all these questions tbe
| Republicans hold to-day the vantage
i ground. Wise legislation by tbe incoming
Congress will make the position even
stronger than it is to-day, aud as the old
South ceases to be a stronghold of Democ
racy the radicals and agitators will have
no position of strength from which to
assail either the proaparity of the people
or the constitution of the Republic.
Honest-money Democrats, protection
Democrats and conservative Democrats
have a rieot to a share in the triumph
to-day. We hope to hail them as perma
nent members of the Republican party.
They have done well in this campaign,
and we bave faith they will continue in
welldoing.
THANKSGIVING DAY.
The next big day to occur in tbe course
of oar National life is that which -will be
set apart for Thanksgiving. On that day
even those who have to eat metaphorical
crow this morning; will have a share in
the reality of turkey. The day is not fat
distant and it is worth while to think
about it a little before we put politics aside
and settle down to the coming rush of
holiday business.
In the political situation itself there
Is enough to furnish men of reflect
ing minds with occasion for feel
ing thankful that they live in a
Republic such, as ours and among a
people capable of supporting it. For
months past our citizens have been di
vided into rival parties, each intent on
overthrowing the other at the polls, and
yet this morning the defeated ones are as
loyal as the victors to the decision of the
majority, and nowhere is there any sug
gestion of opposition to tbe peaceful in
auguration of tbe President-elect.
A people who are capable of deciding
complex questions and exciting issues at
the ballot-box and laying aside their par
tisan antagonisms immediately after the
result of the vote is announced is certainly
a people that ought tr/ have an annual
thanksgiving. Never has there been a
Republic such as ours. Never has there
been a peopie capable of supporting one.
Republicans, Democrats and Populists
alike have therefore a good reason to look
forward this morning to the coming of
Thanksgiving. On that day we are to
meet with one another around hospitable
boards and rejoice as Americans in the
greatness of our country and the general
prosperity that prevails among us. Party
politics for the time is laid aside. We are
neighbors, we are friends. We shall have
more election contests hereafter, but for
the present we are all for harmony, peace
and industry.

VALLEYS UNDER
THE PACIFIC
Interesting Lectnre by Prof.
Davidson Monday
Night.
The Submarine Elevations and
Depressions Lucidly
Explained.
AN INTERESTED AUDIENCE.
The Subject Has an Important Bear
ing en Navigation Not Before
Recognized.
In the hall of the Academy of Sciences
Monday night Professor George Davidson,
at one time cnief of the Government Pacific
Coast Survey, delivered a lecture entitled,
"The Submerged Valleys of the Pacific
Coast." This is the third of a series
recently inaugurated by the society for
the purposes of popularizing science. The
large and attentive gathering which
listened to Professor Davidson last night
served to show that the society's laudable
effort is appreciated.
The lecture was illustrated by stereopti
con views of charts specially prepared by
the professor, whose treatment of his sub
ject proved both instructive and enter
taining, altboueh many details were
necessarily technical. After having re
viewed at some length tbe geographical
character of the coast of California he
proceeded to describe still more minutely
tne submarine depressions and elevations,
which have been referred to, not inaptly,
as valleys and mountains. The Pacific
Coast differs considerably from the At
lantic seaboard in this particular.
Off the coast of New Jersey, far out at
sea, the soundings are invariably shallow,
whereas the "plateaus" of the Pacific are
comparatively few and of small extent.
Generally speaking, the whole plateau of
ttie Pacific, from California to Japan,
averages a depth of 2400 fathoms, or a
little over 24 miies. Tne character of the
seaboard, ha was careful to point out, is
no indication of the presence of these
submerged valleys. For example, where
we might expect to find one at the open
ing of the GoMen Gate, we have instead a
broad plateau. So tar something like
twenty-five submerged valleys have been
discovered within Califorman waters, and
in extent they vary greatly. The question
of their formation he preierred to leave to
thn geologist. He merely tnrew out the
suggestion tnat it, nodouDt, corresponded
with the formation of American rivers;
what were formerly mountains became de
pressed and subsided below the level of
the sea, the valleys remaining. The dis
tinctive feature of Mich valleys is
a great depth of water near the
stoore or, at least, where under
ordinary conditions the depth would be
inconsiderable. Tbe slopes, which rise
on either side of these depressions, are
often very steep indeed, as in the case oi
a submerged valley 315 fathoms deep oft
tue coast of Southern California, whose
slopes have a grade equal to that of Jones
street between California and Pine. The
bottom usually consists of green and blue
mud, which gives place to sand and shells
as the twenty-five-fathom mark is reached.
Oil wells arc sometimes found at a depth
of seventy-five fathoms. One of the most
important of the Pacific Coast submerged
valleys is that which enters Monterey
Bay. This has been chosen as the site on
which to land the projected Pacific cable,
because the latter can be carried in to the
beach without exposing it to the risk of
being fouled by anchors. There are four
notable valleys Detween Point Arena and
Cape Mendocino, the most southerly run
ning so near the coast that tbe twenty
five-fathom line is only a few yards away
from the shore.
The subject of submerged valleys has
an important bearing upon navigation
not hirherto properly recognized. More
than once, the speaKer reminded his hear
ers, vessels have run aground, though
their captains protested that immediately
before that happened the lead had indi
cated an ample depth of water. The pro
fessor expressed his conviction that in a
case of this kind, the ship must have
been heading up a submarine valley, in a
dense fog, the shore being thereby ren
dered invisible. Twenty-eight miles from
the mouth of the Columbia River, at
which distance 100 fathoms would ordi
narily be found, there are 430 fathoms of
water.
At the end of his lecture Professor
Davidson showed a chart, prepared last
May, in defense of Nansen's theory of
polar currents. He added a few words of
lucid explanation, which were well re
ceived by his auditory.

Btillbâ L. 8., City. It is not "a fact that

that they have not yet become familiar with

value for all debts and dues, public and private,
except when otherwise expressly stipulated in

est passage on record. Her averags speed was
20.867 knots per hour. Subsequently the
steamship St. Paul ot the same line beat that
record, having made the distance over the
same route and between the same points in
six days and thirty-one minutes, her average
speed being 21.08 knots per hour.
In Case of Death -G. W. S., Oakland, Cal.
In case of the death of a President-elect before
his inauguration there is a great deal of diver
sity oi opinion as to what would be done, in
view of the fact that there is no provision to
meet such a contingency. There are some
prominent men, well versed in politics, who
are of the opinion that in such a case the Vice-
President-elect would become the President
There was a time ia the history of this coun
try when the President-elect refused to enter
upon the discharge of the duties oi the office
ot President of the United States on the 4th of
March and that led to a complication, yet the
Vice-Presiaent-elect did not. under the provi
sions of the constitution which declares that
"in case of the removal of the President from
office or of his death, resignation or inability
to discharge the power and duties of said
office, the same shall devolve on the
Vice-President" to enter upon the discharge
of the duties of the office. The 4th of
March, 1849, fell on Sunday, a day that the
constitution does not recognize as legal in tbe
transaction of such official business as the ad
ministration of an oath of office to a presi
dent-elect. At noon on that day the term of
President Polk terminated, and President
elect Zachary Taylor prior to that time
refused, on conscientious grounds, to be sworn
in, as he did not believe he could legally ac
cept the office on that day, it being a dias non.
The prospect was that the government would
be without an executive head for twenty-four
hours, and as those were exciting times, Con
gress, then in session, was extremely anxious
that there should be no vacancy. A very heated
debate took place. There was an inability on
the part of the President-elect to act, but Mil
lard Fillmore, the Vice-President-elect, did not
step in, but Congress decided that David
R. Atchison of Missouri, President pro
tempore of the Senate, must, from Sunday
noon iftitil the following Monday noon, as-
Kume the functions of President, and he did.
It is probable that in the case of the death of
a President-elect between the time of his elec
tion by the electoral college and inauguration
Congress would step in and declare who
should be President.

MANY BALLOTS MAY
NOT BE COUNTED

and the Distinguish
ing Number.
The Law Said to Be Clear in
Barring Them Out of
the Count.
THE REGISTRAR IS IN DOUBT.
Is a Voter to Be Disfranchised by
the Stupidity of the Elec
tion Officers?
The Board of E'ection Commissioners
had a hot session all day yesterday. The
usual tardy voter clamored like a small
army at the railing asking to be certified
to the precinct offices as being o. k. ana
permitted to vote.
The early registration was responsible
for much of the trouble. Many who went
on the great register so early in the year
had moved into some other election pre
cinct, and, forgetting or neglecting to se
cure a transfer on the books, found when
he presented hirasell at the polls that he
would not be permitted to vote. Straight
way he hastened to the Election Commis
sioners, sitting all day for tbe hearing of
such cases, and told his tale of woe.
There was no incident of note interrupt
ing the business of the board throughout
the daytime. â¢
After the close of the polls and when the
count began reports of trouble at the
polling-places began to follow one another
with considerable rapidity.
First came the report from the Twen
tieth precinct of the Thirty-fourth that a
number of votes had been cast there with
the stub showing the number of the Tote
so that it could be identified. Protests
were immediately filed Dy watchers
against having these votes counted, inas
much as the law distinctly states that no
distinguishing mark shall be upon the
ballot
These ballots were held out and a re
port made to the Registrar. He decided
at first that the voter should not be de
prived of his vote because of the stupidity
of the election officer and that the votes
should be counted.
It was argued, however, that Judge
Murphy had decided otherwise, and so he
intimated that if the question was put to
him by the election officers themselves he
would tell them to throw out the ballots,
though it did not seem to him the proper
thing to do.
Following is the law in the matter:
1209. No member of the election board shall
deposit in the ballot-box any ballot from
which the slip containing the number of the
ballot has not been removed by the inspector.
Reports concerning the same difficulty
came in from tne Twelfth Precinct of the
Thirty-first and from the First, Second
and Third of the Thirty-fifth. It is said
that in these three precincts of the Thirty
fifth all ballots, up tc 3:30 in the after
noon, were cast with this stub, with tbe
distinguishing and identifying number
upon it, so tnat if these few lines of law
rule out the ballot with tbe number upon
it a majority of the votes in these pre
cincts will not be counted.
The Registrar's office had reason to
fume, as the night wore on to midnight,
over the very general disregard of printed
instructions. Precincts by the halt-dozen
only returned two packages instead of
three. The two were necessarily sent
back. The First Precinct^ of the Forty
third District won distinction by sending
in only one package out of the required
three.
The Fourth Precinct of the Thirtieth
Assembly District sent in only two en
velopes, and those who made the returns
said that two tickets had been checked
upon register. This made Chief Clerk
McGlade rub his head a little, for the in
structions on this point were plain
enough.
Two or three precincts failed to return
the semi-official returns, and these had to
be sent for.
The returns from the Fourteenth Pre
cinct of the Forty-third Assembly Dis
trict were found to be unsealed when they
arrived at the Registrar's office, and were
held to be sealed later in. the presence of
election officers.
There were very few complaints last
night, for the general reason that only
tbe general ticket was counted, which wai
straight and easy work.

POLICE PRECAUTIONS.
No Reports of Any Serious Trouble
Received From Any of the
Precincts.
The most careful preparations had been
made at police headquarters to cope with
any serious disturbance during the elec
tion, which tortunately did not arise.
Chief Crowley was in his office ail day and
up to midnight ready for any emergency.
Sergrant Motfitt was assigned to the tele
phone at headquarters to receive reports
from the different stations ana communi- '
cate them promptly to the Chief, while
Captain Wittman had two sergeant! and a
detail of men at the Central station and
two patrol-wagons ready for any call.
So reports of any serious trouble at any
of the precincts were received and only one
report of an arrest for illegal voting.
Complaints were sent in from two pre
cincts in the southern district that election
card* of different candidates were being
distributed within twenty-five feet of the
booths and Captain Spillane was at once
instructed to warn the offenders away,
and if they refused to place them under
arrest.
Every othcer detailed to a precinct had
been instructed to send in as soon as pos
sible the total number of votes cast in ins
prucinct to nia station, which were to be
telephoned at one* to the Central station.
With the exception of nine precincts,
eight in the southern district nod one in
the northern on the PoJot Lobos road, all
were in before 9 o'clock. The total vote
cast in the 304 precincts heard from was
63,492. Giving a foir estimate lor tlie other
nine. It would moke a total vote of 63,000.
Sergeant Nash took the results as tele
phoned and marked them on a sheet, des
ignating the districts and precincts, pre
pared by Captain Wittman.
"This has been, without exception,"
said Chief Urowiey lÂ»st night, "the quiet
est and most orderly election I have seen
in my long experience as Chief of Police.
There has been no trouble whatever ana
only one arrest for illegal vetinr. Last
election there were, I think, thirty-nine
arrests of that nature.
"1 have done the beit possible with the
force at my disposal and have pressed into
service all the specials in the .City and all
the men on the retired list, making in all
a fnrcc of 519 men on duty at one time.
Each man will be on constant duty for
between sixteen and seventeen hours,
which is hard on them but unavoidable. -
â¢â¢Never before during an election hare I
been able to handle my men so well and
with so little trouble. It has been doe to
my clerk, Captain Jlealey, in the first in
stance, who has in a hichly efficient man
ner carried out my instructions as to de
tailing the men in the different districts,
and in the second place to the new cap
tains, who have done tueir duty with re
markable energy and ability."
The missing precincts were all heard
from before midnight and the total vote
registered was G0, 173.
Republicans to Celebrate.
There will be a meeting of the National
Republican Parade Committee at the
headquarters of the National Republican
League, 24 Fourth Btreet, Pioneer build
ing, on Wednesday evening, at 8 o'clock,
to take action on properly celebrating the
Republican victory.

Pass Upon Them
at All.
Consequently They Made a
Mistake of Some Im
portance.
2FFECT OF NOT VOTING THEM.
What the Amendments Provideâ The
Woman Suffrage One Fcught by
the L quor Dealers*
Six constitutional amendments were
voted upon at the election, and the usual
thing happened, that is that many voters
larrying too long over the offices folded/
up and handed in their ballots witnout
voting on the amendments at all.
Considerable interest was felt in the
sixth amendment, that on woman
suffrage. The lady watchers who had this
amendment at heart and who remained
up in the booths until the small hours re
ported that the Republicans generally
voted against woman suffrage while the
Democrats seemed to favor it.
This remarkable phenomenon was ex
plained on the supposition that the ma
jority of tno liquor dealers' association
were Republicans and that they voted in
accordance with the publisned request of
the association to vote against it, because
it was feared that the Women's Christian
Temperance Union might exercise the
ballot to introduce prohibition in this
Stale.
Many voters thought that not to vote
for an amend ment would serve to defeat
it, because it would be required to have
two-thirds of the total vote cast. But the
phrase "two-thirds of the total vote cast"
means two-thirds of the vote cast for or
apainsi the amendment. Consequently
the opponents of woman suffrage missed
a point wnen they neglected to vote on the
proposition.
Amendment No. 1 exempts mortgages
and trust deeds from taxation.
Amendment No. 2 provides that all elec
tions shall be by baliot or by sucq other
method &s may be prescribed by law, pro
viding that secrecy in votincbe preserved.
No. 3 is important and is here given in
full.

cintione shall be jointly and severally liable to

with an improved feeling and rising prices.

London advices. Shippers were doing
more business at frcm lid to 9d over yes
terday's prices. Freights were firmer.
LIVERPOOL, England, Not. aâ The
wheat market opened nigher on the
strength of yesterday's American market,
advancing immediately after the opening,
owing to a scarcity of sellers. After a
temporary reaction on realizations, the
market strengthened on an improved mill
ers' demand, and prices became higher in
consequence of a feeling of confidence iv
the result of the election in ti.e United
States. There was active buying on both
local and American accounts, prices
reaching 2d above the opening price. A
predominance of selling causeu the mar
ket to lose .VI, but it closed finally at 2Ud
higher. The aggregate sales were 150,000
quarters.

WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 3.â United
States Consul-General Burke at Tangier,
Morocco, reports to the State Department
in his dispatch of the 15th ult. that an
other act of piracy was committed by the
Moors off the Riilian coast on the Bth of
October la->t. A French sailing vessel was
attacked by about 100 Riffians in small
boats about twenty miles off Cape Couch
(Cape BabjizunV As soon as the attack
became known on shore the Spanish Gov
ernor of Allhucernas and some of the
Spanish colony at once set out in the little
steamer Seviila to render aid to tne
French vessel. They arrived in time to
capture three of the pirates' boa's, which
were ou the point ot pushing off for the
shore with prisoners and plunder. The
Spaniards boarded the French ves:^l,
which was n possession of the pirates,
und after a severe struggle succeeded in
rescuine the captain and a number of the
crew. The Spaniards are reported to have
had one man killed and four or five se
riously wounded. Some ot the wounded
have since been reported as having died.
It is also reported that some of the crew
of the French vessel have died from their
wounds.

MR. BALL A ND A WIDOW.
A Chicago Home H'recked by Alleged
Heavy Ttefalcation of an Employe.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 3.-0. F. Hall,
confidential man for the Stockman's Com
mission Company, doing business at the
stockyard", has disappeared, and the of
ficers . f the concern assert that the entire
assets of the company, amounting to $24,
-000 in cash and negotiable securities, are
not to be found.
Hall's whereabouts is not positively
known, but it is intimated that a widow
who lives in a Western city may know
something about liim. It is said that
some time ago he became acquainted with
the woman and became enamored of her.
She was in Chicago a few days ago, and it
is believed Hall has left town with her.
Hali - disappearance, presumably with
the funds of the concern, has forced the
Stockmnn's Commission Company to<
cease business. It has notified the banks
and its patrons that it will not resume.
Hall was lor years the trusted man for
the Campbell Commission Company, and
when that concern tailed he became con
fidential man for the Stockman's Com
mission Company. J. H. Campbell, the
president of the insolvent concern, after
twenty-three years of active business lite
at fhe stockyard*, is now forced to look
for a position among his old associates.

FRANCE CRIES OUT
AGAINST CRUELTY
Deputy Denys Interpsllates
the Government on Its
Policy.
Declares That It Is Necessary to
Make a Clean Sweep of One
Corner of Europe.
IN THE NAME OF HUMANITY.
Protection Against Massacre Must Be
Given to A 1 Armenians in
Turkey.
PARIS, France, Nov. 3 âIn the Cham
ber of Deputies to-day M. Denys, Deputy
lor Cochin China, interpellated the Gov
ernment, demanding to know the action
France would take in defense of the Arme
nians. Continuing his iemarks, he asked
what the powers had done since 1880 in
defense of a race whose sufferings were
without a parallel in history. M. Denys
then recapitulated the horrors of the mas
sacres in Asia Minor and Constantinople,
during the recital of which tne Chamber
was greatly agitated.
The Deputy for Cochin declared that it
was the duty of France to decree in the
name of humanity to prevent the < ccur
rence of further massacres. In order to
effect this, he said, it would be necessary
to make a cle&n sweep of this corner of
Europe and to guarantee protection not
only to Christians, but to the Turks as
well. The whole of civilized Europe was
interested in the purifica ion of Turkey,
and France had a right to convert her
allies and all Europe to undertake the
Uak.
The speech of M. Denys elicited great
applause.
Count Albert de Man followed M. Denys
in a speech in which he declared that sad
der even than the Armenian atrocities
was the inertia with which Europe toler
ated such outrages.
"Europe," he said, "cannot longer re
main pass ye. Wnile the present state of
things exists it is only natural that the
Armenians should be in a perpetual state
of revolt."
"France," he added, "ought to do for
Armenia as well as for Crete and take the
initiative in a concert to assure the secu
rity of the Armenians."
M. de la Gosse and M. Hubbard ap
proved and emphasized the remarks of
Count de Mun, and If. Hanotaux, Minister
of Foreign Affairs, followed. M. Hano
taux said that the Armenian movement
would not have taken upon itself such an
intensity of contact with our people had
not it imbued certain Armenians with a
desire for independence.
The excesses of the Ottoman Govern
ment, he *aid, had furnished legitimate
motives for complaint and when the ques
tion assumed an aspect of grave import
ance England understood the danger of
acting alone.
The powers, be said, were convinced of
the necessity of their solid union, but
there must be no isolated action and no
interference with the integrity of the
empire.
Among the fertile results of the recent
visit of the Emperor of Kussia to Paris,
M. Hanotaux said, may be mentioned a
precise exchange of views in regard to
Armenia, and the perfect community of
ideas which exists in united Europe will
give the Sultan to understand the neces
sity of his assuring the security of all his
subjects of whatever race; but violence
will not aid the difficult task of Europe.
M. Janrez. the Socialist leader, replying
to M. Hanotaux, said that the Sultan had
been frequently admonished, but without
avail. The remarks of M. Hanotaux, he
said, left the wnole question open. He
reproached the Foreign Minister for en
deavoring to render the Armenians solely
answerable for their troubles in the re
sponsibility for which Europe and tbe
Sultan were involved. Eighteen months
ago, he said, Europe undertook to defend
the Armenians, but the atrocities continue
to this day.
M. Deveile moved the order of the day
approving the declarations of the Govern
ment, and the motion was adopted by the
Chamber.
SPAIN'S ISLAND WARS.
Insurrection in Philippine Isl
ands Getting Worse and
Worse.
The Rebels Score a Victory Over a
Spanish Attacking Party, Kill
leg Many .
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct aâ The Sun's
correspondent in Madrid, writing under
date of October 19, says:
The situation in the Philippine Islands
is growing worse and worse. General
Blanco telegraphs: "The rebels attacked
our detachment at Talyta. Lieutenant-
Colonel Blanco started to assist the Gov
ernment troops, but could not force his
way through the enemy's lines. He had
two officers and sixteen privates killed and
one officer and twenty-one privates
"wounded.
"When I learned this I sent two bat
talions under Colonel Posos and Lieu-
tenant-Colonel Ortiz. TheTalysa detach
ment tried to break through the enemy,
but failed. I am trying to prevent the
enemy from invading Batangas."
Blanco must have failed in thi?, for he
telegraphed later: "The occupation of
Talysa by the rebels compels me to move
to the left and prevent the enemy's ad
vance toward Lipa. For Batangas alone
I need two regiments at least."
This news spread like wildfire. Confus
ing though it *as, the public realized that
a disaster had occurred. In an interview
with an editor of El Imparcial tne Minis
ter of War said thai tho people here were
responsible for Spanish reverses in the
Philippine Islands. Impatient clamor
had precipitated military operations be
fore the arrival of the peninsula re
enforcements. "The Government," be
added, "does not know yet who leads the
insurrection; but from what iB going on
we must infer that there is a bead to di
rect all this, for we are not fighting disor
ganized bands."
The people here believed that the mere
presence of Spanish troops in the Philip
pine Islands would cause ihe insurgents
to surrender. The energetic and doter
mined resistance of the islanders was
therefore a surprise to all, and passing
from one extreme to tho other everybody
is now convinced that Spain has to lace in
this far-off quarter a war as serious as
that in Cuba. The insurgents are masters
in the province of Cavite. outside of tbe
inner city. They still hold the convent.
All that has been said of the losses in
flicted upon them by the Government
troops, the correspondent adds, is false.
WEYLER'S DODNFALL COMING.
Carliit Bands Organizing and Political
Agitation in Spain.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. a-The Sun's
Madrid correspondent, writing under date
of October 19, say> :
El Paisujo says that Carlist bands are
secretly organizing in tae northern prov
inces. The Ministerial newspapers seejc
to deprive this news of all political im
portance, but the lact is that there is now
a great political agitation throughout
Spain. Both the Carlists and the Repub
licans are unusually active.
The day of Weyler's downfall seems to
be approaching. La Correspondent Es
pana compares the movements of General
Maceo to those of Napoleon in Italy and
trance. He has beaten all the Spanish
columns in his wav and thrown them on
his right and left without interrupting his
well calculated and triumphal march to
ward the eastern part of Pinar del Rio
province.
The Minislerial Epocasays: "The Go
vernment has done everything it can to in
sure success in Cuba. But it will not at
tempt to take upon itself the direction of
military operations that are thousands of
miles lroni here. There is no sacrifice in
men and money that the Government has
not made. So the eyes of Spain are now
fixed upon the military leader. The pub
lic waits for the long-expected news of
victory."

SIXTEEN TO TEN THE SCORE.
Exciting Game With Much Linr-
Bucking on One Side and Punting
â¢ . on the Other.
Berkeley won the . football match with
Reliance yesterday afternoon. It was a
close call. The first half ended with the
i core 10 to 0 in fay r of the athletic club,
and the many partisans of the- college
team 'assembled in the Central Park
grounds were silent, gloomy and fearful |
of the prospect on Thanksgiving.
Then the second half came, and with it
a change that revived hope in the breasts
bedecked with blue and gold rib Dons. The
Reliance men continued to hammer the
College line with telling effect, but Berke
ley cot the ball and punted close to the
K.-.iance goal. There the clubmen made
their . mistake. Tney tried to rush the
ball' back, instead of punting at once out
of the dangerous territory. They lost the
ball, and two quick little dives by Sher
man and a hard buck by Ransome carried !
the 'ball across for a touchdown. Then :
for a second time the ball was punted close
dawn to the R liance poal.
0 A longer dash by little Sherman, a
fumble and an offside play by Reliance,
nnd Berkeley had the bail almost to goal,
and'Ransome forced it over. That tied
Jlie score, though the touchdowns were
not gained as were those of Reliance, by
long continued â¢ advance?, step by step
crowding their opponents back.
BuVthe last touchdown was the particu
lar* feature of the match because of the sixty
yard run that led to it. The bail had been
bronght out to the Reliance twenty-rive
yard line after a touchback. Oliver took a
â free kick past the center of the field. Hall,
Berkeley's bit; left half, caught the ball
and followed by Ransome he swerved to |
1 the leit as be ran swiftly down the field,
several of tbe college players grouping be
tween him and the on-rushing Reliance
men- and protecting the runner as he
rapidly skirted the eastern edge of the
field and finally landed the ball over the
goal line.
Several reliable spectators declare that
the runner stepped just in touch near the
10-yard line, but the linesmen didn't no
tice it. Ransome kicked a difficult goal
and redeemed himself for the easy one he
missed before it. Tue score was then as
it was at the end of tbe game, 16 to 10.
After the last kickoff Reliance got the
ball near Berkeley's 45-yard line and be
gan another onslaught on the college
f*n.sb line, carrying the ball step by step
â  toward the Berkeley goal. But the ref
e;ee's whistle put a stop to the threaten
ing advance, and time was called with the
Reliance but six yards from goal, "k *~
â¢ The largest crowd of the season was
present.
/Craig, Hall, Sherman and Ransome
i were the most noticeable and most ap
plauded' players for the blue and gold,
-white little Carter, Walton and Ariett did
great work tor Reliance. :
. One of the features of the clubmen's
advances in the first half was the power
of big Oliver, who literally dragged the
squirming Carter forward through the
yielding college rush line. But Oliver sus
tained several injuries, and Carter was re
lieved" by Nabl. and the effect was very
noticeable during the second half, when
also a very light and comparatively inex
perienced 'end was put in to relieve
Lany'on.

AS THE BALL MOVED.
The opening tilay is at the top of the diagram, which represents the Central Park grid
iron as viewed from the west side. Ransome kicks oft' for Berkeley from tbe center of the
field down to within seven yards of the Reliance goal at the Market-street end of the field,
aiid Waliou allows the ball to bound over the line in order that Reliance may by rule carry
it out to the 25-yard line fora free kick. Thence Oliver punts well into Berkeley territory,
and Ransome runs the ball back 12 yards before he is clowned near the Berkeley 40-yard line.
From that point all the succeeding movements of the ball are exactly Indicated, and may be
followed by tbe aid of this explanation of signc: A wavy line indicates where the tall is
kicked; a broken line where it is moved by aa official ; a straight line where it is carried; a
large dot where It is down with Berkeley in possession ; a cross where it is down with Reliance
in possession; short parallel line* where the man with the ball is forced back or tackled oack
of the rush line; a cluster of dots where the ball is fumbled; a scalloped line at the end of a
wavy line where the ball is allowed to bound after a punt.
The initial of the player carrying or kicking tbe ball is on tbe line ot its progress, and
that of the one making the tackle or downing the ball appears in instances where a notable
down occurs. On Berkeley plays R stands for Ransome, H for Hall, S for Simpson, Cg for
Crais, G for Geisberg, Wh for Whipple, Ay for Avery, Sh for Sherman, X for Kennedy ; and on
Reliance plays O stands for Oliver, \V for Walton, C for Oner, A lor A. Ariett, At for J. Ariett,
b for Sexton, Ws for Wells.
HOW SUFFRAGISTS
SPENT THE DAY
They Had Representatives
in All the Different
Booths.
The Leaders Toiled On and Never
Showed the White
Feather.
ENTHUSIASM FOR " iHE CALL."
The M Chronic c's â  Parthian Stab to
Suffrage Has Won It Many
Bitter Enemies.
Before 3 o'clock yesterday 205 women had
taken their tickets at the suffrage head
quarters and had igone to the different
booths to watch the count.
They were earnest, quiet volunteers,
who were not exactly charmed with the
work before them, but they looked noon
it as a duty to take any work given them
for the furtherance of the cause of tbe
sixth amendment.
Tne Board of Election had given per
mission to tbe Slate Woman's Suffrage
Association to send representatives to
watch the count, and young girls and
matrons volunteered in large numbers to
do tbe work. By 5 o'clock in the afternoon
women had been detailed to watch the
whole 313 .ifferent precincts. +
All day long the leaders were to the
front, smiling and working in the hurry
of coming and going and bustle of mar*
shaling hundreds of women for their
different booths. For months these ladies
have toiled and hoped and prayed that
their measure would pass, and yesterday
was their Waterlooâ from a French or
English-Prussian standpoint. Whatever
anxiety they felt in their hearts, however,
they kept a brave and smiling front.
There was no ex ibition of women's
nervea or women's anxiety. The leaders
and their side decamp had a smile for
every one. Every tendency to murmur on
tbe part of subordinate workers was
quelled with a general's band, and the
calmness and cheerfulness which prevailed
on ail hands would have done credit to a
well-re listed home.
"Yes; I am tired, tired, tired," said
Miss Anna B. Shaw, who was pale and
exhausted-looking, but who wore a smile

which showed that her spirit triamohed
over physical weariness. "I would not
take a thing back. We have done our
best."
"Hurrah for The Call! While we have
a nickel left we'll huv The Call," said
Mrs. Nellie Holbrook-Blinn. "The women
have worked in a dignified, honest man
ner, and whether the amendment carries
or not they have won the respect of every
one. and The Call has stood by them. 1 '
"When The Call came out for suffrage,"
said Miss Susan B. Anthony, "it is pos
sible that it lost some subscriber among
liquor men, but it has more than com
pensated for that. Now that the Chronicle
has turned against suffrage, the best peo
ple in the Slate are turning a ainst the
Chronicle. The Call may have lost in
the beginning, but the other people will
lose in the end. The women ot California
Â»iii not forget what they owe to The
Call."
Miss Mary G. Hay cheered her followers
with these wordd: "When I got. up this
morning and saw the sun shining, I
thought it meant a victory for us, not
only in the City, but in the State." And
the above arc only a few of the cheerful
smiling words of cheer which fell from
the lips of the busy, anxious women
suffragists yesterday.

WOMEN AT THE BOOTHS
How the Suffragists L, tokert Out for
the Sixth Amendment.
Most of the booths contained at ieast
one woman last night who sat all evening
qaietlv counting tbe votes .'or and against
tbe suffrage amendment. It took courage
of no mean order for some of these quiet,
dignified women to go in amon â¢ the men
and sit hour after hour at tbe rough deal
tables, in tRe glare of the kerosene lamps,
with the curious crowd outside peering in
at the "woman in the booth."
Not one woman, however, reported that
sue had been treated with discourtesy in
the booths. Even in the roughest pre
cincts where the men, as a rule, smoked
and kept their bats on, there was a sort of
chivalry shown toward the silent woman
with her pencil and notebook.
Swearing was strictly barred out of the
booths; occasionally a man would begin
to tarnish hi* speech with profanity, but
he was quickly silenced with "Don't you
see the lady? Lookers-on who had been
imbibing and were inclined to make
trouble for the men at the tables were
husbed into less vigorous and noisy dem
onstrations of disapproval, because there
was a lady there, and in many cases the
conduct of tbe tellers was so kindly and
chivalrous that the women lelt that a
good deal of silent sympathy was being
given them for the faot that the vote was
three to one against them.
A Hopeful Silver Man.
George W. Baker, chairman of tbe Bimetallic
Club, is still hopeful of Mr. Bryan's election.
He said Monday that Mr. Bryan can win
without Illinois, m be expects tne South, with
the possible exception ot Maryland, to go solid
for free silver, f nen, if one or two of the
Middle Western State* sand by Mr. Bryan,
Mr. Baker says, It will mean aeieat for Mr.
McKiuley.

PLAIN VIOLATION
OF ELECTION LAWS
The Voters in the Thirty-
Third See One Another's
Ballots.
Spectators Looking In at the
Window Note Where Stamps
Are Put.
ONE MAK'3 ANGRY COMPLAINT.
It Caused Strips to Be Nailed Between
the Voters and Paper Over the
Windows.
Perhaps one of the most flagrant viola
tions of the election law occurring in this
City yesterday was in the Thirty-third
Assembly District. What made the mat
ter worse was that absolutely no attempt
was maae to lessen tbe evil until a citizen
of the district interfered.
The violation of lue law took place in
Precinct 10, situatec on the east side of
Potrero avenue, about eighty feet south of
Twenty-ttiird street. A heavy vote was
polled all morning and until late in the
afternoon.
Early in the afternoon two trestles were
brought in aud set about eight feet apart,
on which were placed two scantlings.
Here at one time four men were seated
preparing their ballots in full view of one
another and a line of voters. This was
kept up for some time.
Finally a citizen of the precinct, who
refused to divulge his name, complained
to the inspection officers. They tardily
went to work and nailed strips of canva*
between the voters, so as to prevent their
teeing one another's haliots.
Later on their virtue was still further
awakened from its slumbering, and some
body went out and tacked two strips of
paper across the two windows on which
ihe improvised booths fronted. Prior to
that time the region of the windows was
crowded by a gang of street urchins, eaeer
to look in on the voters. In the crowd
were also one or two men.
Yet even with these alterations it was
an easy thing for the men in line waiting
to vote to see how those at the improvised
booths were stamping their ballots. And
that they did see was proved by their con
versation alterward, when one would twit
the other for casting his ballot for a cerÂ«
tain man.
"If I had not said anything," declared
the complaining citizen, "I oelieve voters
would have continued to cast their ballots
in plain Â»ight of one another and the spec
tators all day."

Cole, R. P. Hun but and W. H. T. Titus.
They took seats around tne table and
ordered champagne by the dozen in order
to celebrate the victory of the Republican
party.
A description of the humorous charac
ter of this assemblage ( would if compiled
make a volume of rare reading matter,
buffice to say that Charles L. Patton was
elected chairman of the meeting, with the
injunction to read all telegraphic dis
patches with accurate exactness, without
any attempt at embellishment. This duty
befaithfully performed to the best of his
ability.
Tne tirst toast of the evening was to the
health of the distinguished convert to
Republicanism, Evan J. Coleman, pro
posed by Chairman Patton. Mr. Cole
man, in response to the toast, said : "1 am
65 years of age. I was Dorn in the State
oi Kentucky and I nave been all through
liie a stanch Democrat, but in this year,
1896, I have cast my first vote for the Re
publican party. [Great applause.] I cast
this vote for the prosperity of the State.
1 will be a Republican as long as I live.
1 had remained with the Democratic
party until it fused with the Popu
lists on the silver question. I am
now for McKinley. There is.no more
solid South. It is one great and grand
Nation, irrespective of territorial, reli
gious or divisional lines. lam an Ameri
can, and now join hands with the party
that has made tbis Nation one of the
greatest and grandest on earth." [Great
applause.]
C. L. Field spoke on the greatness of the
American people.
Charles W. Conlisk, a prominent repre
sentative of The Call, iesponded to the
toast of the "paper that did so much for
the success of the election of McKiuley
and Hobart." In a modest manner he
spoke of those who were instrumental in
bringing to that happy conclusion the
great ana grand results of which now pres
ent were here to celebrate.
For himself he had been a Republican
all through life, and he saw no reason
why be should now change.
He welcomed into the ranks of the Re
! publican party such men as the distin-
I guished man who publicly avowed his af
filiation with the party ot patriotism, pro
tection and prosperity. He meaut E. J.
I Coleman, and to him he extended the
| riL-Lii hand of fellowship, and hoped that
| he might live long and enjoy the boun
| teous blessings oi a republican form of
i government.
He was glad to see the son of Kentucky
ioin with tne son ot the pioneer oi Cali

UNKNOWN HEROES

Some of the Strange Expe

Men ay the Palace.
Why the Aged "Jerry," John
Brodie and Others WjII Be
Missed by Guests.
INSIDE HOTEL KNOWLEDGE.

The story published yesterday that the

long been a picturesvue feature ot the
Palace Hotel were to give way to white
men evokÂ«-d much interest. Many of the
colored men have been with the hotel
since its opening and not to see them
about would, as a number of the guests
said, make the hotel seem like a new
place.
Pr.ibably none of them will be missed
more than old Jerry Peterson, the bland
septuagenarian, whose white mustache and
fluffy gray hair have for a score of years
made him so unique a figure.
No Governor of California was probably
ever better known to the masses as well as
to those who have wealth. He was
for years the protege of Senator L. J.
Rose and many others who took a special

liking to the old man. What be does not
know of the ins and oats of the Palace
would be bard to tell. He bas been
especially kind to the ladies, whose cards
he has long taken in the receptio -room, j
and he will long be remembered gratefully !
because of his courtesy.
John Brodie, he of tbe gigantic
whisker?, because of which be bas been
yclept General Burnside, is more brusque
of manner, but none the less picturesque.
He has been more sequestered, however,
because of bis place on one of the upper
floors of tbe hotel.
If it were not for his color he would be
taken for a general in tbe army, so ap- j
parent is his dignity. It iÂ» years and I
years since Brodie and Peterson came 10

ored men about whom there are interest
ing stories. William Turner, one of the
belimen, is noted as a traveler who has
had strange and rlangerous experiences.
He was for two years vulet to ex Governor
Jo tin G. Downey, and traveled with him
over the worid. He was al?>o for several
summers valet to Peter Taylor, the
weak y lumberman.
Prior to this he was in an awful ship
wreck, the story of which caused a thrill
over the clobe.. Turner 13 a native of the
West Indie.-. He began work in a hotel
there Kept by Frederick Lewis Cleveland,
a brother of President Cleveland. It was
the Royal Victoria Hotel, and Turner was
for a pood while steward in it.
In 1870 lie catue to America with Mr.
Cleveland, actine as his valet. They re
mained several months and then sailed,
accomimnied by Cecil C. Cleveland, an
other brother of the President, in the
United States mail snip Missouri for the
West Ind.es.
During a raging storm the Missouri
took fire, ar.d the flames spread so fast
that out ot 193 persons aboard but seven
teen were saved. AM the others were
either burned to (leather orowned. Turner
was an expert swimmer and he was one of
the first to reach a boat that had been
hastily lowered. He anj seven others got
in and were rescued a day and a half later.
Another boat with pine persons aboard
driftpct for eleven -lays. Of these rive died
of exposure and starvation.
6. L. Tyrrell is another one of the hotel
force who has had a remarkable life. He
is a native of British Guiana and servpd
six years in the American navy. He
served on the famous ship Tennessee, on
the Richmond and on the celebrated Pen
sacola.
"Whatever happens, I am not afraid I
can't get a job," said Tyrrell yesterday. "I
can go to work for Uncle Sam. He has
been pretty good to me and I can enlist
aeain if I want to, as I have two honor
able discharges."
Throughout the hotel are others who
have had stance and curious exp-riences.
Thee quiet, dark-skinned men, who go at
the beck and cull of ofientimes thought
less not to say impolite people, have in
many instances done heroic things â
things not dreamed of by those who unÂ»
cerernDniously make demands on them.
A PICTURESQUE SPOT.
â â â¢
The Gem That Was Inherited From the
winter. Fair. â¢ â¢ -
There is no more picturesque spot
within the limits of Golden Gate Park
than that gem which . was inherited from
the Midwinter Fairâ the Japanese garden.
It has since the close of the fair been kept
up in the same condition that it was
during : the days that it was in charge of
the little maidens from the land 01 the
Mikadoâ the odd , structures from - the
Orient, the fantastic roseries, the ponds
filled with lilies between the stems of
which swim beautiful gold and silver fish,
ihe compartments wherein are k< pt the
gigantic storks.who delight to rest on one
le ', and the stunted pines all serve to
make up a picture of oriental beauty. On
the north side an attempt was made to re
produce in miniature one. of those great
gardens of chrysanthemums that are one
of the wonders of Japan, but somehow it
did not come up to the expectations of
those who conceived i he idea.^_^_a^___

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 4. 1896.
WEBFOOT WONDERS
WERE WALLOPED
Citrus Belt Baseballists
Beat Them Very
Easily.
Fennimore, the Supposed Great
Pitcher, an ExDioded
Phenomenon
BASE HITS IN BIG BUNDLES.
The Game and Its Principal Incidents
as Seen by the Horse
Reporter.
Fennimore, the boy wonder of the Web
foot State, is an exploded phenom.
Heralded as. a world-beater the Monogram
twirler stepped into the box at the Fol
som-street grounds yesterday afternoon.
Fifteen minutes later he loomed up an
East St. Louis Hindoo in a Surburban
handicap. Hopelessly beaten his team
was floundering along, eleven runs to the
bad, with the lads from the citrus belt
bowling along under a double wrap. Fen
nimore may be a wonder at a Hooppole
County fair, but when he gets in a fast
class be has got as much chance to win
as has a one-legged mau to corral first
money in Â» footrace.
The Tufts-Lyons representatives got all 1
the best of the start. Although the Port- i
land entries made two tallies in the open
ing dasti the Southerners in their half
on their stritle and gaiioped around the >
bases until i heir tongues hung out. When
they finally quit from sheer exhaustion j
eight notcnes had been cut in their side 1
of the stick and their opponents had |
slipped their weight-pad in order to have
a chance to get within bailing distance. !
The only result of the endeavor was to j
tuu-e the orange-eaters lo pull the bat in i
the second heat and hammer out a lead of !
five additional lengths. After that they j
pulled up and finally won in a walk by a I
score ol 16 to 4.
The Oregon boys were first to the post,
and Mr. Harvey, who engineered the bat
tery wGric of the tougu-iions. took his |
place in fear and trembling. So agitated j
was he tuat when Bchmeer sent a warm ;
grounder at him he Jell in a heap, and be
fore he recovered thpre was a Schmeer on |
the initial bag. Mr. Parrott. who was next
in order, sought to obtain a cracker, but
for some unÂ«xplaine<i reason tailed, and j
after making three vigorous stabs at the
elusive pigskin retired to the bench. Ham- I
niond, the littie backstop of the Alameda I
Alert*, who was pressed into service to '
assist Mr. Phenomenal Fenniutore, re- !
placed Parrott at the bat. He seeded a
large, balloon-like ball and swatted it to
v.ard Mr. Heavyweight Cummings, who
otticiuted as lender of the three-quarter
bag for the lions. "Gran'pa," as the >mall j
boys called him, was evidently thinking
cf the vote he lost by not being at home, !
and fumbled the sphere. Hammond
reached first safely, and IScbmeer, who in
the meantime had sprinted la the half-pule,
making a new record for the di&tance, got
to thud on the play. Fennimore, the
great, then faced his opponent*. He sent
a slow grounder to Tufts, who did not
want to shame "gran'pa" by appearing
to exce. the old gentleman, and so also
gave an exhibition of "butter-fingers" at
work. Fennimore got a life, thus filling
the bases, fcchmeer, however, thought he
saw a chance to complete his journey dur
ing the excitement attending Tufts' error
ami set sail for home. Although he
pulled the whip on himself as he neared
the finish. Franck, who had secured the
ball, threw it to He ,ry. who nipped
Schmeer out, by a nose, at the plate.
(Hies then lined out a safe one and Ham
mood and Fennimore scored. Gile.- stole
second and tried to get some on Henry's
overthrow to catch him and was also ex
tinguished at the rubber.
Tiien came the rupture of Fennimore's
reputation. He storied out well enough,
Franck being retired on an easy grounder.
Tults, who was next in order, was pre
sented with a base on balls. Harvey hit
saiely, as did Tyler, filling the bases. The
wonder was not equal to the strain, and
instead of striking out the next man, gave
him a Dase on bails, forcing in Tufis.
Henry tnen sent an easy one to Schmeer,
who allowed it 10 escape him and Harvey
and Tyler scored. Farrel hit the ball right
in the eye and brought Henry home, he
having purloined mcond. Fereie also
made connections and got a sale hit. The
Jusillade bad disconcerted Fennimore, and
he made a wild pitch, advancing both the
runners a panel. Wolfrkill broke down
at first, and Franck, coming to bat for the
second time, placed one beyond reach of
the fielders, scoring Farrel. Tufts also
culled a uit. and Fergie and Franck sot
home. Harvey ended the agony by send
in : a slow one to the pitcher, who threw
him out at first. Fennimore pulied up
lame.
The Monograms got two more men
around the bases in the third event on
two hits and two bases on balls, while the
citrus belters added five to their total in
the second on five safe drives, with a total
of seven bases. Schmeer assisted in the
work by adding another error to his col
lection.
After the fourth beat, the sport quieted
down, and there was little to interest the
big crowdtrhich was in attendance.

CHRYSANTHEMUM SHOW.
The Beaatiful LÂ»iÂ»i>lay That There la
iv Golden Gate Park.
"There is nothing particularly new in
the lln- of blossoms," said Henry E.
Hollrow, the head gardener of the con
servatory in Golden Gate Park, yesterday,
"except the display of chrysanthemums
in the west m end of the big glass house."
The display is that of the late flowering
kind, and it fills the racks on three sides
of the section in which they are placed to
delight the eye and cause all lovers of
beautiful blossoms to oxc.aim, "How ex
quisite " There are flowers of every
shade, of every variety Known to the flor
iculturists, some as large as a head of
young cabbage, others as delicate in
texture as the finest cambric with serrated
edges that give them the appearance of
having been made by the lacemakers of
Europe. There are others that are vari
gated and the coloring is sucii ttiat no
artist has the skill to mix his colors to
iiittch the shades.
"There has not been such a crowd of
people in the conservatory for many
months," said Mr. Hollrow, "as there was
last Sunday. I was clad to see it, for it
shows that th? people are beginning to
appreciate the beauties we have on exhi
bition."
The wonderful Victoria Regia is still in
bloom, and up to date it has sent forth
eighteen flowers, and buds are still ap
pearing.

The arrow files with thÂ» wind. The top flgnrea
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
days; those underneath It, if any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and hundredtbs,
during the past twelve hours.' Isobars, or solid
lines, connect poln s of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hirh" means hitch barometric pressure and
is usually accompanied by fair weather: . "low"
refers to low pressure, and :is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rain*.
"Lows" us. ally first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high In the interior
and low along the coast, and the Isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable*
but when the "low" is Inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is improb
able. With a "high" In the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coaÂ«'. warmei
weather may be expected in â¢ summer and colder
weather In winter. The reverse ot these condition*
will produce an opposite result. .-.-â

OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 3.â At 1 o'clock
this morning the returns from Alameda
County indicated a complete Republican
victory. wi;h one exception. The vote for
Presidential electors, when complete, will
probably eve MeKinley a majority of
about 5000. There are no particular dis-
Sam P. Hall Allowed His Friends
to Make His Fight.
tricts in wh'ch the Republican vote pre
vails, but the majority is about evenly dis
tributed all over the county. Around
Haywards, where the Democracy has long
considered it had a stronghold, the Re
rublican majority is larger even than was
expected. The result certainly proves
the failure of fusion and by 8 o'clock
hardly a Bryan bad,e could be seen on the
â¢street.
The speed with which the well-known
Bryanites sought cover was only equaled
by tne rapidity with which those fusion-
Jsts who were not recognized changed
their colors and appeared to be anxious
i for recognition as belonging to the great
I Majority.
I The stand of Congressman Hilborn has
\heen indorsed, and dutricts that have
hitherto been strong ior Mr. English have
passed him by on this occasion.
The fight for the two Superior Judge
ships has been very keen, but W. E.
Greene and Hall can hardly lose their ma
jorities when the entire vote is in. Thomas
Garrity and Judge M. E. Gibson ran very
strong and polled larger votes than were
expected for them.
Very bitter has been the fight for Justices
of tne Peace, but there is no doubt that J.
. J. Allen and F. V. Wood, the incumbents,
have been re-elected. J. W. Stetson and
J. McElroy each had too many friends for
the others to be successful.
A complete Republican legislative ticket
has been elected. Clark has carried the
Forty-sixth Assembly District, J. A. Way
luire the Forty-seventh, F- W. Leavittthe
Forty-eighth, O. Breiling the Forty-ninth,
H.-H. North the Fiftieth and H. E.Wright
the Fifty-fiTst.
. Fred 8. Stratton is safe in the Twenty
seventh Senatorial District.
Oneof the great surprises of the elec
tion was the manner in which the sixth
amendment was defeated.
â¢ It has always been thought that Ala
â¢â¢ru.eda County was a stronghold of woman's
juljrage, but the result has proved that
there was more smoke than fire. It will
probably be beaten by a majority of 8000
votes, while it needed two-thirds to carry.
Very close has been the contest between
Supervisors in the Fifth District. It
narrowed down to a tight between W. 8.
Pelonse, J. Mitchell and J. Allyn.
Mitchell, R., and Pelouse, Ind., ran
jff r y close, but the Republican candidate
C%xie out ahead by a moderate majority.
Nn the Fourth District Roeth, R., had a
walkover from Brown. Ind., and Gray,
Fusion.
In the contest in the county Supervisor
ial district the First is the closest of any.
The latest returns show that Jarvis (R.)
;s leading Wells (fusion), and as the
former s majority is not confined to any
particular precinct,. it is conceded that
Jarvis is elected.
Thomas Pearson, the colored candidate
for the Assembly from the Forty-eighth
District, did not poll 6 per cent of the vote
of the distrct.
Historic Ahamont precinct, in which Hil
born was counted out four yearÃ ago, gave
English a slight majority, although Hil
born ran ahead of hie ticket. The exact
figures are: McKinley 30, Bryan 52, Hil
born 34, English 47.
It is worthy of remark that the railroad
ward (the First), in which the 'coerced"
employes were wearing McKinlev badges
under duress and "winKint; ai their con
cealed Bryan badge," gave McKiniey a
larger majority than ever.
The complete vote in ihe First Super
visorial District is so close that it can
only be determined by the official returns.
THE DAY'S BATTLE.
How It Was Fought and Won and
Lost In Alameda County.
OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 3.â Alameda
County did not retire last night. Of course
many of its conservative citizens took a
I few hours' rest, but at this particular time
; they do not constitute "the county." The
; term is monopolized just now by those to
whom politics are Daramouut. These had
not finished their interest in last night's
parade before they begun to prepare for
tne work of to-clay.
The voting began early, and in some of
the precincts one-liaU of the entire votes
were recorded before 10 o'clock. Every
thing was quiet and orderly, and the Aus
, tralian ballot system once more covered
1 itself with glory.
The increased number of booths, which
guarantees that no elector shall have to
walk more than a couple of blocks to the
: polls, has almost done away with the use
; of carriages, and the streets were quieter
i than at any previous election.
There were many interesting sidelights
to the election. Men who have walked to
the polls arm in arm for a score of years
to-day went separately. Hundreds who
have hitherto been stancu Jeffersonian
Democrats to day walked to the ballot- box
with a gold ribbon on tbeir coats.
Judging by appearances one might sup
pose that a majority of the baliots that
went into the tin boxes were ior Republi
cans, but it was what is known as a "silent
; ballot." People seemed to be voting their
I convictions, and consequently were not
I discussing their choice.
Senator Denison, wearing several kinds
of badges, indicative of his loyalty to Mc-
Kinley, was one of the most familiar
figures on the street. Nothing seemed to
trouble him and he walked up and down
1 Broadway chatting with his friends and
; remarking occasionally with a twinkle of
: his small eyes, that it was only a question
! with him of how large it would be. "It."
lof course, was McKinley's majority. He
I made one reference to the California eagle
! that he sent to Ohio several weeks ago,
j and said, that ne had no doubt the bird

: utmost capacity before midnight.
Tom Garrity, with plug hat and frock

coat that came below his knees, was as
busy as Senator Denison was quiet.
Colonel Garrity is making the fi-ht of his
life. He beliaves that there are always a
number of voters who hesitate to make a
choice until they get the rubber stamp in
their fingers, and Colonel Garrity was de
termined, if pos-ib'e. that they should
make him their choice for Superior Judge.
It meant a great deal of work, but the
colonel was equal to it and went about
his task as good-naturedly as though he
were malting a speech before a friendly
society, lie seemed to bave many friends
and was very much in evidence, but, of
course, this was no indication of what the
ballot-box might reveal.
Fred V. Wood, who has made ait ex
cellent Police Justice, certainly made a
mistake in not obtaining the Republican
nomination. Had he retained the friend
ship of Senator Earl lie would have had
no difficulty in being successful before the
Alameda convention, but ho evidently

preferred his record to a party Indorse
ment, nn-J mai*> iq energetic tiÂ«ht, with
no other apparent backing than that of
the A. P. A.
Sam P. Hall, tall and placid as ever
and whose whiskers seemed to be more
abundant than usual, did not appear to be
making a single effort in his o -n behalf
for the Superior Judseshm. Many of his
fsiends, however, did for .Sara what he is
absolutely incapable of doing for himself,
viz. : make a political fight, and his supp
orters certainly appeared to be sufficient
to elect him.
Hardly any of the other candidates
were in evidence during the day, and a
new precedent seemed to bo established
for the first time in tin* election. It was
that of allowing friends to attend to the

Alone and â
electioneering and ot the principals keep
ing in the background. While this was
not acceptable to "the push," as it pre
vented a great deal of buttonholing and
other things known to that element, it
was certainly profitable to the candidates.
In all thj districts the tight most ap
parent was that for Supervisor. In each
of the three districts from which a candi
date was to be elected there were from
four to six names on the ticket, ana not
one of these resigned at the eleventh hour
in favor of some one else, as is nearly
always the case; consequently each can
didate continued his little fight up to the
hour of closing the polls, thus leaving the
issue in each case very much in doubt.
The First Ward, which shares with the
Sixth the distinction of being the liveliest
in the City on election day. was remark
ably quiet. Very little challenging was
done, no fights were indulgd In, no acci
dents were reported and the general con
duct of the day was rome what of a surprise
to those acquainted with the former his
tory of these districts.
The Fifth District was not itself. For
Colonel Garrity Making the Race
of His Life.
twenty years it has been customary to see
the kid-gloved electors of this fashionable
territory gallantly led to the polls by ihe
rio of English tjrotliers. So quiet was It
in this ward that not even a dog -rlared to
bark. But the appearance of harmony
was deceitful. For the first time in the
English history the three brothers voted
not the same ticket. John English sided
with Warren and perhaps voted the Kryan
electoral ticket, as they certainly did the
Warren B. Concessional ticket. " William
D., however, although it is probably only
generous to suppose that he gave a vote to
nis brother for Congress, wore a gold
badtje and so far as the Presidential vote
is concerned was on the other side of the
fence from bis esteemed brethren.
In the interior of the county a large vote
was polled, but nothing exciting was re
ported. The main fights were those cf
Supervisor and Assemblyman, especially

for Calling Off the Wrong: Name.
â¢ The beneficial effect of the action of the

ALAMEDA'S ACTION
MUCH DISLIKED
Recedes From Its Position
on the Tidal Canal
Agreement.
Will Not Abide by the Terms
That Were Accepted a
Week Ago.
ALL WORK WILL BE DELAYED.
Oakland Cannot With Dignity Listen
to Anything More Prom the
Encinal City.
Oakland Office Fan Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Nov. 3. f
To the surprise of everybody on both
sides of the estuary the Aiaaieda Board of
Trustees has" broken the compromise
agreed upon between it and the Oakland
Board of Trade regarding the harbor im
provements.
The Trustees have forwarded a docu
ment to the Board of Trade of this city in
which at great length they set forth the
reasons why they wish to repudiate their
] agreement of a week ago. Much surprise
was expressed at that time at the conces
sions made by tfie Encinal City to Oak
'â  land, and it was supposed that the terms
I made by the Alameda committee were too
generous to suit the people of that city.
The supposition has proved true, and the
worK of President Forderer, City Engineer
Poyzer and Health Officer McLÂ«an has
been^repndiated.
. The report of a week ago was, of course,
| acceptable to this city, but now it cannot
j be expected that any other overtures
i coming across the estuary can be regarded
las being offered in good faith. The re-
I port from Alarm da would have been pre
| sented to the City Council last night had
a quorum been present, but it has now
been postponed to the next meeting.
This peculiar action on the part of Ala
meda has reopened the whole contro
! versy and it is now probable that nothing
| will be done till another Congress has met
or another National administration takes
office. . : . .
As the Alameda committee was given
power to act it is regarded as very peculiar
that the Trustees should recede from their
action, and it is looked upon as the policy
of a child who can't get what he wants
j and will not let any one else have it.
A member of the Board of Trade said to
day: '"This action on the part of Ala
meda has forever ended the possibility of
arriving at a compromise, and there is
nothing to do but to leave the entire
matter to the War Department, and of
course that means delay. â¢â  . â¢

BERKELEY FO R McKINLEY
A Quiet but Effective Vote
Polled at the College
Town.
Suffragists Activeâ Stratton, Wright
and Gentry Run Ahead of
Their Ticket
BERKELEY. CaiÂ», Nov. 3.-The elec
tion in Berkeley passed off quietly and
was almost wholly without incident
worthy of mention. In most of the pre
cincts more than 60 per cent of the entire
vote was cast before 10 a. m. At some of
the polling-places citizens were on band
when the sun rose over the eastern hills,
and the casting of ballots began as early
as the law allows.
Very little excitement marked the day's
work and the only interesting contests
were those of the fighters for the sixth
amendment ana of candidates for local
offices.
The woman suffragists were out in full
force. They established headquarters at
the Woman's Exchange building and their
leading campaigners, including Mrs. Car
lisle. Mrs. Haight, Mrs. R. P. Thomas and
Mrs. William Keith, visited the various
precincts in buggies and added their last
stroke to the suffrage cause.
The general rosult cf the National and
Congressional ticket was regarded as cer
tain for Republicans and in consequence
but little interest centered in the big
fight.
Stratton for Senator, Wright for Assem
blyman and Gentry for JuÂ« ice of the Peace
ran away ahead of their tickets.
Aocepted His Resignation.
BERKELEY, Cal., Nov. 3.â The Unita
rian society of Berkeley has accepted the
resignation of their pastor, Rev. Edward
B. Payne, and the trustees of the church
nave been appointed to draw up resolu
tions expressing the profound regret of
the members at his withdrawal. His
resignation was tendered to take effect on
January 1, or if he should find it neces
sary to leave before that time.

SEEKING A PARK SITE.
Oakland Board of Trade Going About
the Work in a, Practical Manner.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, November 3.
The park committee of the Oakland
Board of Trade is now undertaking the
actual work necessary to procure an
appropriate public park for this city.
E. C. Sessions, James P. Taylor, M. J.
Keller, D. E. Collins and A. D. Pryai have
the matter in band. Before they take any
further steps they are anxious to be in
formed of all the available sites.
The following circular was issued to
day, and will doubtless be the means of
inducing many persons to send the com
mittee tne desired information:
The Oakland Board of Trade, having after
much careful consideration concluded that
the time has arrived when, for various reasons,
it is expedient for the city of Oakland to r.c
Â§uire a public park of ample dimensions, say
00 acres, more or less, with suitable ap
proaches thereto, In the suburbs of the city or
in the vicinity thereof, the committee charged
with the duty of securing propositions are
now ready to receive and do hereby solicit
proposals from owners of real estate suitable
for this purpose.
A project of this nature can only be carried
out Dy the issuance of bonds, voted at an elec-

tion of qualified voters, and therefore a favor
able indorsement by the public will depend
very largely upon the cost of the land.
There is a very large territory of unoccupied
property we}l adapted to such requirements
from which to make selections, and owners
must name low prices if they hope for favora
ble consideration^ The field is open to all.
We desire to receive as many proposals as pos
sible from which to recommend a selection, to
all of which a fair and candid consideration
will be given. There are as yet no definite
plans us to location or acreage. Some sugges
tions have already been made, but they are
merely suggestions. No conclusion will be
arrived at until a careful consideration has
been had of the entire field and subject, as the
success of the enterprise will depend upon a
judicious selection of site and a reasonable
cost thereof.
NEW YORK OPERA DEBUTS.
Mme. Harriclee - Darclee's Art
and Voice Â£core a
Success.
A Timid New Tenor and Other Fea
tures of Colonel Mapiesou's
Promises.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 3.-More of
Colonel Mapleson's promises were re
deemed last evening at the Academy when
â¢'La Travlata" was given, and several
members of hia company were beard for
the Mrst lime.
Mme. Harriclee-Darclee made a distinct
success. Her voice, though a trifle husky
in the opening last night, is normally
clear and pure, and she is generally accu
rate in intonation. In quality it is metal
lic and not intrinsically sympathetic,
though her art as an actress supplied its
deficiencies in that respect in the pathetic
scenes of the second act. Her voice has,
however, some really beautiful notes, and
is very thoroughly trained.
Her execution of difficult passages was
recognized by hearty applause, and by
the more deliberate and monumental
"floral tributes" under whicn the ushers
labored down the aisle and which they
finally capsized into the orchestra.
Tne tenor of the occasion, Signor Betti,
made, it was announced, bis first appear
ance on any stage. The announcement
was not incredible. Though it was plain
that he had a pleasant and well-trained
voice, and that as a concert performance
his singing of the music of Aliredo
would have been very acceptable, he has
not as yet found himself on the stage. In
the tint act his nervousness affected his
ringing, wiiich was notably more effective
when he was behind the scenes than when
he was in front of them. But, although
in the subsequent scenes he wns able to
d>> himself more justice as a singer, the
efforts of dialocue and perceptress did not
suffice to make him really personate

TOURING THE WORLD
FOR $10,000 CASH
Exploits of C. F. Brouard,
Who Is of the Staff of
"Gil Bias."
Scars Sustained by Him in Bat
tling With Persian
Bandits.
HAD A TOUGH TIM^, HE SAYF.
Now He Wants to Reach Paris by
Christmas, So as to Get the
Big Wager.
Mons. Charles F. Bronard, a member of
the Paris Artistic and Literary Club and
contributor to Gil Bias, one of the noted
humorous papers, is at the Occidental.
He is touring the world, having started
out in a dress suit with 3 cents in his
pocket on February 25 last on a wager of
50,000 francs, or $10,000, that he will be
back by Christmas. It is hard lines with
Brouard now, for he showed the contents
of his pocket yesterday to be but 35 centa.
Yet he has compassed a great deal of the
earth to date, and thinks he can tinisn the
rest in time to win out in the money.
Mr. Brouard claims to be unlike the
myriad of tramps who have crossed and
recrossed the globe by way of San Fran
cisco and Vancouver in the last couple of
years. He pays his way, he says, by his
writings and lectures.
From here he will go to Mexico, and
there hopes to catch a steamer on the gulf
to carry him safely to Paris, when he can
get the 50,000 francs.
He exhibits a hairy haversack and a
grewsome-looking bludeeon.both of which
have been wltd him during his hairbreadth
'scapes. Without the bludcecn, he says,
he would not be alive, as when he was in
the wilds of Persia highwaymen lay for
him on various occasions, so that it was
a ca^e of thrills and throbs all the time.
Where all h* has not been and what he
has not sepn would be bard to relate. He
exhibits a scar on the underpart of the
right hand, which, he declares, was from
a hand-to-hand contest with a bandit.
Then, he says, he got a shot in his nose
and another in his foot. His nose seems
whole, though, and without spot or blem
ish. No sign of a shot in the foot was vis
ible either.
"With a knapsack over my shoulders I
walked from Paris to Stuttgart," be said.
"From Stuttgart I made my way to Con
stantinople, and from there went through
Persia and other countries to Siberia. I
crossed many of the mountain ranges of
Asia and passed throught great stretches
of wilderness.
"When I started out I slept with my
knapsacic under ray head, but when I had
made a little money by writing and teach
ing I began to ride by rail and boat. When
I reached stretches of wilderness I walked,
rode on horseback, or otherwise proceeded
as I could.
"My hardest experiences probably were
in the interior of Persia, where I was
stopped by the robbers. It was all I could
do to get away. lam looking pretty fairly
in dress and health now, as you have sug
gested, but I have looked different during
much of my trip. I speak French, Ger
man and English, and have traveled at a
great advantage because of my knowledge
of them.
"My first money was made at Rouen,
where the story of my wager written in a
humorous vein for the papers got me
enougn money for a traveling suit. I
have accumulated a traveling trunk,
many trinkets and files of papers and dif
ferent kinds of clothes since then."
Mr. Brouard is about 35 years old, rather
under medium height, with a smooth
shaven bronzed face and dark gray eyes.
He seems like a mau of culture. It is un
certain how long he will remain here. He
is at the Occidental, and reached here by
way of Tacoma.

When it stopped they made the train por

run his train forward far enough to get a

full speed, and thus smash in the express*
car so it could be entered. â 
"All right," said the engineer, "but as
me and ray fireman will jump as soon as
we get her under good speed backing, you
had better go back to the coaches and
wait until the smash comes. If you don't
you stand a good chance of being killed."
They did not want to be killed. They
wanted to get the money â¢ in the express
car. They took the engineer's advice and
waited. The engineer pulled' ahead to get
his distance, forgot to stop, and went on
ahead until be got to Granvilie. Tele
grams were sent out for aid in capturing
the robbers, but these worthies had be

Afterward the engine was backed down,

HIGHBINDERS IN CHICAGO.
San Francisco Methods of Extortion Not
Tolerated by the 'â  Police of â  the
Lake City. ;
. CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 3.â lt is thought
at the Central police station that the Chi
cago highbinders' feud which has terror
ized the Chinese quarter of San Francisco
has reached Chicago, and Inspector Fitz
patrick is taking action ' to promptly sup
press any trouble that may arise among
the 1800 subjects of the Emperor of China
who reside in this city.
Several days ago a Chinaman named
Soong Gee Tong secured a warrant for the
arrest of Holy Woy, who had, Soong
claimed, embezzled some money from him
two years â  ago. When : Woy, was taken trÂ»
the station he declared he was the victim
of highbinders. He said he left Chicago
two years, ago and went to Pittsburg,
where he opened a laundry. He made
money, and a few days ago started to re
turn to China to get married and live in
comfort. The highbinders, he claims,
thought he knew too much of their meth
ods to be allowed to tell them at home,
especially a3 the Emperor had threatened
to decapitate all relatives of the highbind
ers in China. They therefore sent Tong
to Chicago to have Woy arrested and thus
prevent him from returning nome.
Inspector. Fitzpatrick believes the Chi
naman is telling the truth, and says if he
finds there are high cinders in Chicago
they will have to leave town.

VIGNAUX COMING
WITH HIS CUE
The World - Famous Bil
liardist Coming to the
United States.
He Is to Meet Napoleon Ives
and Schaeffrr in a
Tournament
BIG BOOM IN BILLIARDS.
The Olympic C ub Pool Tournament
Is the Entering Wedge in
the Sport
Vignaux, the greatest living French
billiardist, has consented to leave his dear
Paris for another tour of the Dnited
States. It is no small matter to get a gen
tleman of Mr. Vignaux's proportions,
both physically and in reputation, to
move away from the comforts of home,
and it has cost exactly $5000 to do so.
Besides this snue sura, Vignaux has
every assurance that his voice in the ar
ranging of games will have more weight
than it had during his first visit some
years ago.
Nowhere is the news of Vignaux's ac
ceptance received with more pleasure than
it is among the players of the Olympic
Club. Their present pool tournament has
worked up a billiardistic craze, and the
prospect of seeing the greatest living
knights of the cue punch the ivories is a
treat out of the ordinary.
Charles Miller of Chicago, the repre
sentative of the Brunswick, Balke. Colien
der Company, went over to France some
months a.'O after Vi nanx, for the reason
that without the great French player no
tournament could be complete. Gamier,
the other well-known French player, has
been here ever since the last "one-shot-in"
tournament in June, when he took second
place. Napoleon Ives and Jake Pchaeffer
took first an third places, respectively,
in that tournament.
The players from this side of the ocean
who will enter 'he tournament are: Daly,
Siosson. Scha ffer, Gamier, Ives, 'Gene
Carter, Tom Gallagher, Mazzoli, Catton
and McL.iUL'hlin.
Captain Wi.liams. the representative of
the Brunswick, Balke, CoUender Com
pany, who is in this City, had considerable
to say regarding the proposed tournament.
"We hOT>e to brine off in this country the
the gentest tournament the world ever
witnessed, "be said. '-It is a harl thing to
bring men like Vitrnaux, Sciiaeffer, Ives
and Gamier together from their far-away
homes. These men earn thousands of
dollars every year and neither is inclined
to g ye up his business to take a chance.
We have finally got them and the thing is
to make them come as far as San Fran
cisco to give one or more of their games
in the series.
â¢'I know that Daly and Gamier will come
here, and Sp.nk, who by the way is right
at the head of the second-raters, is only
to anxiouÂ« too see California again. Ives
and Schaeffer like this State and so does
Siosson tor the matter of that. The main
thing i-< to get Vignaux to mo c this way
a couple of days from Chicago, and we
will gather on this coast the very best bil
liard players In the worla.
Should they come here as I confidently
expect they will, not one but a number of
tournaments will be entered into. The
first raters such as Ives, Vignanx, Schaef
ier and Sioss-on can mix up. Spinh, who
is so well known here, anri who has
cr/.wled up from beating J. F. B. Me-
Cleery and Ben Taylor, to walloping
'Gene Carter so badly last spring, is justly
entitled to entering against the big man.
''Mazzoii," the champion of the South,
Tom Gallagher, Catton and McLaugnlin,
would make a magnificent tourney, as the
best among the third and second raters.
"I have no idea what pariicular style of
game would be played. When the tourn
ament was held last June, the 18-inch
tulkline was played on the one-si.ot-in
plan. This was a great disadvantage
to Schaeffer. Ives took first place and
Gamier second. It is probable that this
will L-e dropped here and the regular
18-inch balkline played, orelsethe "cham
pion" came. The champion game is an
old-time ore, in which the table-bed is cut
up in the snare of a diamond, the lines
running from a point 18 inches on the
lon;.' rails to another 12 inches on the
short rails. Within these angles but one
carom can be made.
"I am s-o satisfied that the best players
in the world will be with us soon that I
have sent on East for a standard size table,
sxlo feet, on which they will play.
"Strange, isn't it? There is not a
standard table of modern make on this
coast, excepting the lone one wiich goes
to-morrow aboard the steamship Colon
for Acnpulro."
The O:ympic Club call-pool tournament
as played up to last night shows the fol
lowing results:

SINGLE - TAXERS ACTIVE
P ed?es of Support Received
From Legislative Can
didates.
Majority of the Nominees Come Out
Op nly and 0 hers Ask lor
Time to Stuly.
Members of the Single Tax League of
San Francisco have beÂ«n busy since the
legislative nominations were made, seek
ing to obtain pledges trom legislative can
didates for the furtherance of a constitu
tional amendment that would allow the
single tax theory and practice to be en
grafted on the fiscal laws o. California.
Several drafts of proposed amendments
to tne constitution have been made, and
the following may be "aid to represent the
consensus of single tax opinion on this
important matter, though no official dec
laration in this regard has been promul
gated.
Article XIII.
Section 1. The Legislature shall provide for
The Steam Whaler Balaena Entering Port Yesterday. Chief Officer Bowen and Second Mate
Jones Had a Quarrel Over a Squaw, and After an Angry Altercation Bowen Puiled
His Gun and Shot Jones Dead. Bowen Came Here in Irons.
the levying of taxes and the raising of reve
un; in Â«>uch manner as it shall deem just.
Sec. 2. All tuxi-s shall by uuiluriu upon the
same class of subjects within ihe territorial
iimits of the autnority levying the lax. and
shall b- levied, assessed and collected as the
Legislature shall direct.
Sec. 3. The power of taxation shall never be
surrendered or suspended by any grant or con
tract to which the state shall be a parly.
S-.-c. 4. Laud aud the improvements "thereon
shall be separately assessed. Land oi the same
quality or similarly situated, whether used or
unused, shall be assessed at the same vaiue.
Sec. 5. All lands which h.ive been sectionizea
by the United Sthtes Government sunil be as
sessed for purposes oi taxation by sections or
fractions of sections. The Legislature shall
provide by law for the assessment of all lands
not sectionized by the United States Govern
ment. '
Sec. 6. The Legislature may provide for the
payment of taxes by installments.
Sec. 7. The Legislature shall have power to
enact all laws necessary to carry out the pro
visions of this article.
The legislative nominees of all parties
have been asked to indorse this plan, and
it seems remarkable that so many have
expressed an interest in the matter,
though not all have expressed a willing
ness to sign or indorse a direct pledge.
Some who are known to be open advocates
oi the single tax plan in private life have
hesitated to go on record in advance of the
election for the reason that they COnsidet
tueir predilections ;o be so well known
that they do not require further consider
ation in that regard.
Yet gui c a number of answers have
been received by the league and others
are expected after the election.
Those who haveconie oui unequivocally
in favor of the single tax are as follows:
Calvin Ewing, Nineteenth Senatorial Dis
trict; Thomas Watson, Twenty-eighth
Assembly District; Timothy E. Treacev,
Thirty-tirst Assembly District; Frank E.
Mahonev, Thirty-fourth Assembly Dis
trict; F. M. Tuiey, Thirly-nimh Assem
bly District; J. S. War.iall. Thirty-ninth
As3emoly District; H. C. Dibble, Forty
fir-it Assembly District; H. M. Owens,
Fortv-rirst Assembly District; L. M. Man
zer. Fortieth Assembly District.
Samuel Biaunhart, nominated for Sena
tor in the Nineteenth Senatorial D stric'.,
was somewhat equivocal in his reply
touching his position on the single tax,
but the league hopes he will be with the
others wh.en it comes to a vote.
In Los Angelea letters were written by
Ralph E. Hoyt to tbe legislative nomi
nees of tliat region. Nine men replied,
eight ot whom declared themselves unre
servedly in favor ol the single tax and one
a-ked for time in which to study the
question.
Throughout the State a petition to the
Legislature has been circulated, the object
being to secure attention to this proposed
reform in the State's fiscal arrangements.
The petition reaas thus:
PETITION TO THE LEGISLATVRE.
We, the undersigned, hereby petition for the
enactment of such measures as may result in
the collection ot all public revenues â state,
county, township and municipalâ from the
value oi land, irrespective of improvements in
or on it, and for the abolition of all other
taxes now levied for this purpose.
This petition has been signed .^12,000
citizens, and it is arranged that a repre
sentative committee of single tax adher
ents shall attend the session of the Legis
lature in Sacramento this winter for \he
purpose of advancing the interests of
what they deem to be an important and
beneficial innovation in the State's laws
relating to the subject of taxation.
PICTURE OF MR. PICKWICK
It Is Unveiled in the Lodgercom
of the Pickwick
Club.
A Gala Open Meeting of a Socia
Branch of the Order of
St. Gicrge.
The monthly open meeting o* the Pick
wick Lodge, Sons of St. George, h'ld at
their lodeerooms on Mason street, was
signalized Monday night by the unveiling
of an excellent, almost life-size crayon
picture of Mr. Pickwick himself. It was
drawn by George B. Rosewell after H. K.
Browne, from a frontispiece in tne origi
nal edition.
F. D. Brandon made an entertaining
little speech in presenting the picture.
Then the curtains were drawn aside, the
members rose up applauding and gave a
vote of thanks to Mr. Rusewell.
In speaking of tne order Mr. Brandon
?aid that while composed exclusively of
Englishmen or the sons of Englishmen it
had a social sideâ the Pickwick Club, for
instance â where good citizens were wel
corned without reuard to nationality.
While there were no better American
citizens than were they of English birth,
he said, stiil even among those who had
fully decided to renounce the mother
country and adopt the stars and stripes as
their flag there was that which caused
them to hesitate about "taking out iheir
first papers." He said it should not be bo.
He thought it not only a great privilege
that was offered them* to became Am ri
can citizens, but it was their duty to come
forward and take their share in the Gov
ernment.
Herbert H. Bygrave paid a neat com
pliment to the press in behalf of the
order.
An excellent musical programme was
rendered and a generous lunch enjoyed.
A Saloon Row.
Jamas Ryan of Oakland was taken to the
Receiving Hospital Monday with two lacer
ated wouiklr on his forehead, one on his
cheek and his left shoulder dislocated. He
said he got into a row in a saloon and he was
knocked down and jumped on. He was so
drunk lie did not know where the saloon was
or anything more about it.

THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 4, 1896.
KILLED BY A
FLUKING WHALE
How "Tom" Warren of
the Steam Whaler Bel
vedere Died.
He Was Master of the Bark
Atlantic Lost Near the
Ci:ff House.
A S'i/MPEDE OK THE FRONT.
Two Ccws Caus d a G eat Deal cf
Trouble and Amused the M ny
Voters
Anothrr death among the whaHng fleet
has to be reported. There have been
violent deaths, deaths in me ice, deaths
from natural causes and suicides, but so
far this is the only occasion on wh eh a
man lost his lif* from misadventure.
A boat was out after a whale an I just as
the boatheader was ready to cast bis bomb
the mamma! dived and in doing so struck
the boat with its tail. The boatheader got
the full force of the blow and was knocked
overboard. He was hauled aboard but
died befure he could be pot to tue ship.
"Tom" Warren, the dead man, was well
known in San Francisco. Years ano he
was master of the whaler Atlantic and was
in command of her when she went ashore
near the Cliff House. The loss of life was
great. Thousands of people went oat to
the beach to gaze on the wreck and the
papers at tne time were full of the
disaster.
AJter the tronble was nil ovrr Warren
again went whaling as a general hand.
Last season he secured a job on the Bel
vedere as boatheader and as such sailed
for the Arctic.
His body has been embalmed and will
come back on the steamer for interment.
Among the other whalers that eot in
were the Navarch and' Cape Horn Pigeon.
The Navarch broueht 9DOO pounds of bone
and 500 barrels of oil. October '11, in lati
tude 45 deg. 50 rain, north, longitude
147 deg. west, a southwest gale was run
into and the port quarter boat was carried
away. The storm was a heavy one; the
galley was flooded and the crew hud to
surf r for waut of coffee for twenty-four
hours.
The Cape Horn Pigeon also had to suf
fer. On October 12, in latitude 45 deg
north, longitude 176 deg. west, she also
was caught in a gale and the storm carried
away the starboard quarter lifpboat. The
bark had a narrow escane. The catch of
the Pigeon was 900 barrels of sperm oil
120 barrels of whale (ordinary) oil and
52 OJO pounds of bone.
According to the latest reports the Bel
vedere has twelve whales and the Beluga
eleven whales. The former vessel went
further north than any ship in the fleet
and in consequence Captain Wiliiams did
remarkably well.
It was a remarkably dull day on the
waterfront yesterday. All the Britishers
were tied up and :he master? were untown
watching the tight be:ween McKinley and
Bryan. Strange to say nearly all the
Britisher* were for protection' and had
they had votes every one oJ them would
have gone for sound money. A couple of
coal ships were at work and '.he whaling
bark Margan took out some oil, but out
side of these not a stroke of work was done
on the water front. The Britishers had
no chance to get any of their cargo out, so
the captains spent their time in watching
the apprentice boys decorating the cabins
for last night's celebration.
The revenue cutter Hartley was put to
good use yestenlay. ' The Commodore
Perry has been lying off Meiggs wharf for
some time awaiting repairs. When it
came to moving her to the iron woris
there was no boat to tow her, so the Hart
ley had to get up steam and do the work.
Strange to say, the little cutter was equal
to the task, and the Perry i-Â« now safe in
dock, while the Hartley continues to take
boarding-officers out to vessels that arrive
during the day.
About the only excitement on the water
front yesterday outside of me election was
the attempt ol two vaqueros to take some
cow* to Butchertown. The animals got
away when near Foisom-street wharf and
made a run for Mission street. Cable and
electric cars barrel the way, but the
bovtnes paid no attention, and made
the best of time. When opposite Howard
street one of ihe vaqueros lassoed one
cow by ihe heel and brought her up with
a round turn. The other cow was making
directly for a Bryan booth, when the
lasso fell over its horns and it also was
marched away. These cows formed the
only diversion that was furnished the
voters on the water front yesterday.
STABBED ON THE STREET.
An Affray Resulting From a Difference
of Political Opinion.
A stabbing affray took piace yesterday
afternoon growing out of the high feeling
over the election, and a* a result P. J.
Kelly, a well-known local politician of the
Twenty-eighth Assembly District, lies at
bis home suffering from a severe woumi.
Kelly went to the polls shortly after 2
1 o'clock, voted, and was returning toward
Market street when he encountered a
young fellow named Mackay at 51 Natoma
street.
Mackay spoke to Kelly, but the latter
undertook to pass without making any re
ply. As he did so Mackav pu-hed against
htm, knocking him from the sidewalk.
Kelly turned angrily and struck at
Markay. who stepped "back, avoiding the
blow. The two men erappled, and in the
fracas that fo lowed Mackay drewakniie
an.i stabbed Kelly in the side.
He immediately ran ana succeeded in
making his escape. Kelly's friends came
to his aid and assisted him to his home.
A physician was summoned, who dressed
his wound, and he is reported as resting
quieily. The wound is not serious.
The affair was reported to the police and
Mackay will shortly be arrested.
SHE ENDED HER LIFE.
Mis. Sophie H.-llrich Cuts Her Throat
With a Knife.
Mrs. Sophie Hellrich, the wife of a
laborer living on Harriet street, near
Brannan, commuted suicide yesterday by
cutting her throat with a table-knife. The
woman was 48 years of age and a native of
Germany.
About four or five weeks ago her hus
band notictd that she was acting
peculiarly, anu at times was afflicted with
strange ideas and melancholia. He en
deavored to have her sent to an asylum
for the insane, but the Commissioners of
Insanity did not think that her mental
condition warranted her committal, and
they stated that she would nrobably out
grow the mental troubles. Heilrich, how
ever, decided that she would be safer in
some hospital than at home, and he took
her to St. Joseph's Home for Incurables
on Park Hill, east of the park.
Yesterday about 11 o'clock Mrs. Hell
rich seized a table-knife and drew it
across her throat, producing an ugly
wound. Dr. Eisler gave the poor woman
his inimedia c attention, but she died
about two Hours later.
ELECTRICITY AND CABLE
Two Cars Crash Furiously To
gether on Kearny and
Sirter Streets.
The Blunder of a Motorman NÂ°ar y
Causes a Frightful Dis
astr.
By almost a miracle no person was hurt
in a car collision at the intersection of
Kearny and Sutter streets last evening,
though the viciniÂ«.y was a perfect jam oi
people. Dummy 54, hauling car 42 of the
Sutter line, was crossing Kearny street,
going east, in charge of Gripman Morri
son. A Mission electric-car bound north
had pulled up, as the Sutter car had the
right of way moving east, but Mission car
1172, bound south along Kearny street,
paid no attention to the cable dummy
crossing ahead of it.
Morrison rang his bell furiously, but
Motorman McGurdy of the electric-car
kept his current on and bore steadily down
on the Sutter-street car. Both cars were
crowded, and tn se in the cable train were
in great danper. The passengers on the
dummy saw iheir peril and piled into the
street and out of the way, without asking
for fares refunded or transfer*.
The big electric-cur struck the cable
train with a loud crash near the junction
of the dummy and the passenger coach,
almost tilting them from the rails. The
passengers in the coach who had not ob
served the coming of the Mission-street
car now became pretty well convinced
that something more excitin.' than elec
tion returns was at hand, and began to
clirrjb out. The car was being pushed
over on Its beam ends, and they, too, did
not stop for transfers, but squeezed
through tie rear door without any more
delay. Several were roughly treated and
shaken up, but fortunately nobody was
injured.
The iramowork of the Mission car cut
deeply into tin- roof of the Sutter coach,
raakiug kindling-wood of that portion of
it, smashing the platform and rail. The
rear ri tit truck of the dummy was broken
in several pieces and tne grip badly
wrenched.
Gripman Morrison, though roughly
tossed about, stayed by his levers and,
keeping a hold of the rope, pulled out
from the immediate place of the wreck,
though all the trucks of the dummy were
off t be rails.
The grip was removed from the slot, and
a <cam of horses pulled the damaged car
off toward the sidewalk out of the way,
and the smashed coaches rolled off to the
carhouse.

- " VEAL CURE" TOE SUNBURN.
Damaged Complexions May Be Reme-
died by Application of a Cutlet.
The cry which rises annually from
every seashore, country and mountain re-
sort in the land has this year met with a
new response, says the New York World.
Pasty lotions of more or less harmless
properties are no longer advocated as a
cure for sunburn. Complexions which
have given a crimson tinge by too long
exposure to summer suns now find their
speediest cure in a veal cutlet. The "veal
cure," as it is called, has leaped into a
popularity which indicates that it is more
than ordinarily potent.
" Butchers at the summer watering places
have ceased to wonder at the loud demand
for veal. They know that when the sum-
mer eirl returns from her sea bath, walk
or drive her tirst thought is lor the veal
cutlet that shall preserve the delicacy of
her complexion. The proper procedure is
to have the cutlets shaved into very thin
slices. These raw slices must then be care-
fully laid all over the face and be kept in
place :' by passing narrow tape or ribbon
over.them. .. ; . . ._*
The result is not becoming, but that is
unimportant. The victim then retires to
a perfectly darkened room' and lies down
for al least half an hour. When the veal
becomes warm by contact with the face it
should be ; turned over and again applied.
When the face has ceased to burn the
veal may be removed and the face gently
waihetl with eider-flower water. The face
should not be again exposed to the sun
the same day, and no soap should be used
on it for a day or two. When these pre-
caution** are observed the veal cure is
guaranteed to be effectual.

A mighty throng gathered at the corner of Third and Market streets soon after the first bulletin was flashed upon the canvas stretched on the
new v Call " building. The crowd swayed and surged to and fro as the tide of excitement and enthusiasm agitated it, and with
rare good-nature held its place until long after the midnight hour. It was the greatest throng that ever gathered around a bulletin
board in this City.
"CALL" BULLETINS
GOT THE CROWD
Thousands See the News
and Cheer for the
Victors.
The Most Successful Exhibition
of N ws Ever Witnessed
in the City.
DEMOCRATS JjSH THEMSELVES.
â¢ News cf the Dawn of Prrsperity
Causes Great Cheering and. a
Bcwn? of Horns.
The display of election bulletins by
The Call last night was tbe most satis
factory feat of the kind ever accomplished
in San Francisco. The people showed
their appreciation by deserting compel in-;
news displays and crowding the streets
for blocks to get a view of The Call dis
play.
It was apparent us soon as the bulletins
began to come in that The Call's display
had met with popular favor, and that
competing displays were at a disadvan
tage.
For hours thousands cheered, blew
horns and yelled themselves hoarse as
they viewed the good news of coming
prosperity, standing, a com; act mass of .
human interest at fever heat, all along
the north side of Market street nearly to
Montgomery, and up Kearny half way
to Post.
During the brief interims between the
bulletins that brought such glad tidings
to thousands of anxious patriots the good
natured crowd laujrhed heartily and
cheered the cartoons that were thrown on
the screen, many of them copies of the
more telling hits published in The Call
during the campaign.
When the news came in from all quar
ters showing that McKinley had carried
almost every State except Colorado, the
Examiner flashed the following classic
josh on its screen: "Oh, mamma! They're
not doing a thing to us!" followed by j
"Are there any Democrats left besides
ourselves?" and "Oh, where aie we at?"
A singular and somewhat unexpected
feature or the landslide was tbe good
humor with which many Democrats in
the crowd seemed to take the news.
Many made such expressions as "Well,
McKinley's election will at least cau.-e
temporary prospenry," and many freely
expressed the hope that McKinley would
"have all the Congressmen but a corps of
ten, whose duties should be to look after
the comfort of the majority, inspect cuspi
dors and keep the Republicans from car
rying away the Capitol."
And so tne big crowd joked and laugh' d
for hours, Republicans yelling, blowing
horns and acting as if the year of jubilee
had come.
Tbe strong and manly face of McKinlev
was cheered every time'his class 6 features
were thrown upon the screen, and a large
percentage of those who cheer- d were
Democrats, solid business men, known
for their patriotism and good judgment.
It was the verdict of all who saw the J
way The Call displayed the news by a
swi:t procession of slides, on a screen
20x36, l.igh up on the fourth story oi its
new buildinp, that nothing so effective
had ever been *9en in the West. The
Call's service was complete and accurate
from every part of the Union, and the
people snowed iheir apprecia ion by view
ing its bulletins anÂ«l cheering until an
early hour this morning.
AT THE PRESS CLUB
A Large Crowd Gathered There to Be
ceive the National and Munici
pal XewÂ«. I
"One of the finest gatherings of men seen
in the Press Club since its big jinks was
there last night to get the â¢ latest election
news.* Manager Martin of the Western
Union had run a special wire to the rooms
and an expert operator took the news
wit ereat . rapidity. . A , large bulletin
â¢board had been placed in one of the large
rooms.' where the crowd could gather, and
on this the type-written dispatches were
bulletined.
â  The bulk of the club membership was
for McKinley.thousn. there was a good
sprinkling of men who were unfavorable
to him. â  ..... . ,
However, the greatest good nature was
shown by everybody. Include! in the
membership of .the club were several nom
inees for office, comprising among others
aspirants" for leading judicial positions.
These and -leading attorneys, â¢ financiers
and physicians, many of* whom were
friends of the clubmen, were present, and
all took a lively interest, in watching the
returns. ..â ".,''
â¢ It was soon apparent that McKinley was
carrying tne country ; in' a way indicating
a landslide^ While the 'National returns
wore coming in news beean to be received
from the city. In this way throughout
the night the interest was maintained. .
The club spiead a sumptuous lunch for
its guests. This, combined with the re
ceipt of the dispatches, and card
playing, made them pass the time very
pleasantly. . â¢

Barkeeper Smith of the Bella Union
Stabbed In the Back by Frank
AVilson, a bailor.
Frank Wilson, a sailor on the ship Caith
ness-shire, that arrived in port Monday
from Scotland, was booked at the City
Prison last night on a charge of assault to
murder.
Wilson and two of his shipmates went
into the Bella Union saloon. 726 Kqarny

of them was very drunk. They had a
couple of drinks and as they were very
noiny the barkeeper, S. J. Smith, came
from behind the bar to stop the row.
While Smith was putting the sailor, who
was very drunk, into a chair Wilson
stabbed him in the back with a jackkniie.
Smi f ,h called to the proprietor, Casey,
that he was stabbed. When Cesey made
his appearance vVilson chased him out
into the street. Casey notified Policeman
Dwyer, and when he got there Wilson and
his friends were throwing chairs around
aud some one had bangeu Wilson over the
head, inflicting a wound.
Smith and Wilson were taken to the
Receiving Hospital and had their wounds
dressed. Dr. Fitzgibbon found that the
knife had peneirated Smith's left lung.

THE SAN KIIAXCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 4, 1896.
FIFTY CITIZENS
DISFRANCHISED
A High - Handed Outrage
Perpetrated at the
Polls.
The Names of So'diers at tbe
Presidio Dropped From
the Register.
SEVERAL WERE 1 X-ARMY MEN
Confession of the Registrar That th
Names Were Scratched Through
Error.
As the result of what seems to be a high
handed outrage about fifty legal voters in
Precinct 18 of the Forty-first Assembly
District lost their mffrage yesterday.
They protested, but the day went by and
through the indolence of somebody in the
Registrar's office they were counted out.
When the Fifth Artillery went East a
few days argo, Colonel Ora am sent word
to the Registrar that 176 of them had reg
istered, consequently their names were
stricken from the list of voters. Forty of
them, however, were transferred to the
Third Artillery and allowed to remain
here. When they presented themselves at
the polls yesterday morning they learned
they were not citizens, though they wore
the army blue.
Added to these were a large number of
ex-soldiers and civilian's who are employed
in different capacities on the Government
reservation, mating a 'otal of eighty per
sons whose names have been unlawfully
scratched from the printed register. One
is Churles E. Thomas, superintendent of
construction on the fortifications. Mr.
Thomas has been a resident of this City
for thirty years and is justly indignant at
nis disfranchisement. He was finally per
mitted to vote under protest, and his bal
lot marked and sealed in an envelope for
investigation. He declares tl at he will
bring suit against the R gistrar for illegal
action.
Thomas M. Shield, an ex-sergeant of the
army who owns a store at the corner of
Baker and Greenwich streets, was also re
fused a vote, but was permitted to do so
under protest and his ballot marked for
identification.
The election officers of the precinct early
notified ibe Registrar of what they plainly
saw was an error, and asked by telephon
for instructions. After some delay the
answer came that the men sliould come to
t c City Hall with their complaints. In
view of the fact that time was flying and
the hour for closing the polls was drawing
on apace, this was ratner an untoward
request.
beven of the disenfranchised citizens
hurried to the Registrar's office and suc
ceeded in getting themselves reinstaied in
time to cast tueir ballots. The certificates
which were issued them read as follows,
showing where the fault lay:
Thomas If. Shieldâ Name omitted from the
register through error of this office and
scratched off. C. 8. TILTON,
William Broderick,
H. T. C'RESaWBLL.
William Scottâ Name was struck off register
through error in this office. It was thonght
that he enl:sted with the Fifth Artillery Regi
ment, which left for New YorU.
C. S. lilton.
Wilmam Kroderick,
Jam km N. Block.
Patrick Larkins, Charles Emstus Caidwell,
Dominions Reichel, Willinni P:tzer, Charles
Eaton E lsworth were Mki-u irom the register
through error in this office.
C. S. TILTON,
William Hroderick,
Jamls R. Block.
The other men did not succeed in get
tinc reinstated before the polls closed,
and were not permitted to cast their bal
lots. . â  â 
Who is responsible for this proceeding
that cost tifiv citizens their votes?
A COLONIAL ROOM.
One of tlie Fcaturig of thÂ« J-n'arged
Mus uui in Ooldeu Cat" Pnvk.
The museum in Golden Gate Park pre
sents an attractive appearance at tbis
lime and the many new exhibits have
been nearly all installed. In fact, the
work is so far advanced that it will be
ready for reopening next Saturday if the
commissioners desire. The various curios
from many lands, illustrative of the
present and of the past, have been classi
fied and arranged with a great deal of
artistic taste and with a view to interest
and instruct those, who will visit there.
One of the new features will be the
colonial room, which wiil be ready in a
few days. It is an exact reproduction of
one of the old-time rooms that were
noticuble in the New England homes in
the days of the Revolu ion. There is the
low ceiling, with great hewn rasters, pine
walls, great wide fireplace with old
fashioned andirons and quaint kettle
hanging over a fire and the odd lurniture
of those days of our forefathers. It will
be filled with articles from the private
collection of C. P. Wilcomb, the curator of
the museum, who at various times has
secured much of the old-style pewter
tableware, delft, kitchen utensils and
home-made linen, each of which has a
history.
NO "STUFF RS" LISTED.
ICf jjlatrar of -Voters II in) on Punctured
. One of the Examiner's Faked Yarns.
â¢ .Registrar of Voters Hinton yesterday
denounced as untrue a . statement pub
lished in the Examiner that. 3000 stuffers
had been found on the list of registered
voters. The Examiner's story was. based
on the fact that a large number of sample
ballots sent out by the Registrar had. been
returned by the postal department for the
reason that the persons addressed could
not :he found. ; .. ' .': . . \ '
. That was an old story, for it was fully
exploited in' The Call â  several days before
the ; Examiner . heard of it. There was
nothing startling in the matter, 1 however,
for it is to be expected that in a list of
72,790 names a certain proportion .will.be
of the character Known as floating popula
tion, with no fixed abode.; , "_ ; :; v* ' '.*
Registrar Hinton explained the whole
thing. He said that of the entire number
of sample ballots sent out only 2493 were
returned, and that this did. not indicate
stuffing or 1 anything -of r the sort; that at
least 1000 of t is numDer were sailors
absent on : cruises, # and that others^were
nomads who happened to be here at regis
tering time, but who had beer- compelled
by circumstances to "move on" * before
election : day ; arrived.; ;' He scoffed at : the
idea of the postal authorities trapping any
"stuffers," and said that all the purging
of the election lists had been performed
in his office: without assistance from any
person or organization.;... ; .;,..,.'. .â-":,';
: The "Examiner/evidently expected its
faked story about the "stuffers" to make a
sensation, but it caused only smiles of de
rision, for voters are accustomed to yarns
of that kind on election morning, and take
no slock in them. It is sale to say. that the
ExaminerVfairy tale,"with its scare bead,
did not change, but rather that it acted as
a boomerang on '-.the; author and those
candidates that it bad befriended.
NEWS OF VICTORY
AT HEADQUARTERS
Republican Leaders Eagerly
Awaited Returns From
the East.
Scenes of Elation When Tidings
Came That the Solid South
Was Broken.
RESULT NOT UNrXPECTEr.
Magnitude anl Sweep of the Triumph
Surpassed All Expecta
tions.
Major Frank McLaughlin, M. R. Hig
gins. Jacob Steppaeher, Ray Falk and the
entire working staff of the Republican
State Central Committee were on duty
bright and early yesterday morning.
Ample preparations had been made for
the reception and display of election bul
letins at headquarters, and during the day
many leading men of the party strolled
into the rooms to inquire for official news.
Early in the day the rumor reached
headquarters that some of the election
officers in precincts south of Market street
and east of Tenth did not report on time,
and that ttie Bryanites organized with out
siders of their own selection. It was also
rej orted that a politician well known to
the "push" south of Market was throwing
down the Republican electors. This oc
casioned some ugly gossip in a whisper at
headquarters.
Dowh in the court of the Palace Hotel
Republicans and Bryanites met. The
latter offered to bet money and put it up
that Bryan would carry California. Re
publicans readily accepted the proffered
wagers. One even bet of $200 was made.
W. D. Sanborn is stakeholder of $1000
on a bet oi $500 that McKinley carries this
State. The money is deposited in the
Crocker- "VVoolworth bank.
W. W. Montague, Judge Hamilton,
Charles N. Felton, Colonel Mosbv. Colonel
George Stone, W. D. Sanoorn and others
were at the rooms when the first messages
from the Fast were received. Returns in
dicating that McKinley had received a
tremendous vote in Maryland, Tennessee
ana Kentucky increased "the confidence of
Republicans. The varying reports from
Illinois created by turns elation and de
spondency. Soon after the first bulletins
began to come others followed in such
quick succession that Steppacher's speed
was put to the test in order to copy them
for display. The news from Tennessee
and Maryland was particularly gratifying
to Colonel Mosbv. The assurance of an
overwhelming majority for McKinley in
lowa caused delight. lowa has a most
moral population, and hence the great
McKinley vote there was deemed sig
nificunt.
W. W. Montague, Judge Curry and
Judge Hamilton exchanged reminiscences
of past campaigns. Mr. Montague said
that since the second election of Lincoln
the anxiety as to the result of a contest
had never been so deep and profound as
now.

preparations were made to receive in the
rooms by direct wire the latest returns,
General W. H. L. Barnes, George W.
B aver, Lucius H. Foote. F. W. "Van i
Sicklen, Frank Reynolds, William Greer
Harrison and many officers of the army
and navy awaited patiently for the first
i fficial tidings. General Barnes said the
public anxiety as to the result of the
Presidential election in 1860 was not as
profound as the feeling now existing. At
that time the people did not appreciate
the magnitude of the impending danger.
At the second election of Lincoln four
years later the feeling was no more in
tense than it is now.
At the Union League Club George Stone,
president, Charles M. Shortridge, vice
president, Joseph Spear Jr., Samuel K.
Tnornton, General S. W. Bacsus, Judge
McFar and, James McNab and others dis
cussed the drift of the silent vote. All ac
knowledged that a great silent vote was
being thrown and until it was counted no
one could tell the result. As the day
wore on the Republicans became more
confident.
As the dispatches. came thick and fast
announcing the unprecedented Republi
can gains the enthusiasm at headquarters
was intense. When the news came an
nouncing that Virginia had joined the
Republican column with 15,000 majority !
for McKinley, Colonel Mosby was ex
citedly elated. He remarked: "I said
weeks ago that McKinley would carry
Virginia and politicians laughed at the
iuea."
When the tidings flashed over the wires
that the "Solid South" no longer existed
in fact but only as a memory, tne joy of
Republicans arid sound-money Democrats
knew no bounds. The reports that Vir
ginia, Kentucky, Maryland and Tennes
see had gone for McKiniey caused the
greatest rejoicing. Ab for Nebraska, gome
regrets were expressed that Bryan had
lost his own State.
At the Bohemian Club Barry Coleman
told how the fight was won in Kentucky.
He has been in constant receipt ot papers
and letters from tbe Bluegrass country.
Said be: "When Carlisle addressed his
great meeting in Kentucky 4000 people got
in to hear him and 6000 stood outside.
When he arose to speak the audience
cheered h'm. The people, the best people
in Kentucky, and the women, the prettiest
women in the world, stood up and cheeeed
for ten minutes."
DEMOCRATIC GLOOM.
Prominent Members of the State
Committee Heard the News
at Headquarters.
There was very little happiness at the
headquarters of the Bryan Democratic
state Campaign Committee in the Califor
nia Hotel last night as the telegrams in
dicating the election oi McKinley began
to arrive.
Chairman Alford was as affable as ever,
but there was a lack of cheerfulness in his
manner. Indeed it would have been ask
ing too much to expect him to show ex
cessive joyousness upon so solemn an
occasion. It must be confessed, however,
that he and his associates bore up man
fully while passing through the painful
ordeal of reading their own doom.
M. F. Tarpey and M. M. Foote looked
over the bulletins in silence a fter they had
been read aloud by the silver-voiced herald
who had been employed for the occasion.
Frank Gould bu-tled in and out nervously,
complaining bitterly that be couldn't get
a word about how Stockton bad gone.
Secretary R. P. Troy was not content
with the slow arrival of the news at bead
quarters and so oscillated between the
committee's rooms and the bulletin-boards
of tbe morning newspapers. He did not
appear to obtain consolation from any
source.
Gavin McNab raised the spirits of tne
crowd slightly at 11 o'clock by rushing in
with a report that south of Market street
the Democratic majorities were being
maintained and that Sam Braunhart was
sure of election.
A feeble cheer was raised when news
from Sacramento indicated the defeat of
Congressman Grove L. Johnson, and genu
ine satisfaction was expressed at tbe ex
pected victory of Can^re.isman Maguiro in
the Fourth Congressional District.
Despite the avalanche of disheartening
news the faithful Democrats remained at
headquarters till after midnight, still hop
ing against hcpÂ°, and apparently exDect
ing a miracle to turn the current in favor
of their favorite. At last the gloom of
certain disaster settled upon the place, and
Secretary Troy turned out the electric
lights, locked tbe door and went home to
wait four years more.
ILLEGAL VOTING.
Frank J. MoGrath Arrested in the
Thirtieth District.
About 3 o'clock in the afternoon Frank
J. McGrath, a printer, swore his vote in at
the Eighth Precinct of the Thirtieth Dis
trict. He claimed to be living at 989 How
ard street. Inspector Donivan found that
he was a non-rssident in the precinct and
ordered Policeman McNumara to arrest
him for illegal voting. He was taken to
the Southern station ana later to tlie City
Prison. McGrath's friends tri'd to get
Judge Joachimsen to sign an order for his
release, but after inquiring into the case
the Judge refused to do so.
The Judge later changed his mind and
McGrath was released on his own recog
nizance.
