THE ANGLO-CALIFORNIAN BANK
ENJOINED YESTERDAY.
Needham Sent Hot Tips to His Friends
in Seattle to Bet Everything They
Had on the Sailorâ Earp Was in
the Police Court, but His
Case Was Continued.
Tbe true facts relating to the appoint
ment of Wyatt Earp. the bodyguard, of
Andy M. Lawrence, managing editor of
the Examiner and otherwise known as
"Long Green" Lawrence, as referee of the
fight, have come to light.
He was appointed at the instance of
Lawrence.
Tfce big pugilistic encounter has re
solved UseJf into a legal mill, and the
prospects are that the attorneys who are
preparing to cross-counter each other -with
a. Superior Judge as a referee will get the
larger end of the pnrse.
The probabilities are that the jurist who
presides over the battle will not have to
be relieved of a gun.
.Suits for purses, damages, old claims
and training expenses are in the air, aud
some of them have already set in motion
the machinery of the law.
â¢Meanwhile the talk on the referee's de
cision is still going on, with Wyatt Earp,
the Examiner's special writer, as the tar
get of any amount of forcible criticism.
Statements that the fight was fixed and
that Sharkey could not lose under any
circumstances are freely made.
; . Those who got even money on Fitzsim
mp'ns just before the fight are wondering
w.hy on earth they did not scent a rodent
and are recalling the many other sus
picious incidents that should have placed
them on their guard. As the non-com
itjittalTeport of the doctors who examined
fcharkey is talked over tne thinking sports
are more and more convinced that the in
juries to Sharkey were made in his room
affer'being taken away from the pavilion.
: ;Martin Julian's statement that one of
ffeose connected with the club manage
ment .was concerned in a conspiracy
to\ rob Fitzsimmons of his well-earned
victory is also receiving much comment,
and the hope is freely expressed that the
matter will be thoroughly sifted in court,
and that if a wholesale job was perpe
trated the guilty ones to a man mil be ex
posed Â»ud driven from the ranks of square
Bports.
The lovers of boxing cannot get over the
fact that when Julian publicly charged
that Earn was fixed in Siiarkey's interest
Gibbs and Groom, who appointed
Earp and had a perfect right to withdraw
him, scid not a word, and allowed a man
on whom suspicion rested to referee the
match.
While not taken as direct evidence that
the management was concerned in any
job, the matter has created no end of talk,
and it will take much to clear these men
from the.suspicion that has been cast on
them.
Danny Needham's telegrams to Seattle
friends telling them to bet their last dol
lar on Sharkey are taken as evidence that
the astute lightweight knew that some
thin? was sure about the fight â and that
was Sharkey's winning.
NAMED BY LAWRENCE.
How Wyatt Earp Came to Referee
the Blfir Mill.
The closely guarded secret as to how and
wliy Wyatt Earp, the bodyguard of Long
Green Andy Lawrence, managing editor
of tbÃ Examiner, was appointed referee is
out.
J. D. Gibbs, the chief manager of the
Kational Athletic Club, explained the se
lection in his own way the day after the
mill, when tbe public rose in its indigna
tion against the referee's unfair decision.
But Gibbs did not tell all be knew of the
matter by long odds for reasons best
known to himself and tbe people he hoped
to shield.
On the afternoon after the light Cnbbs
was being cross-qnestioned by reporters
fcsd other people innumerable on the sub
jectuntil. sick at heart, he blurted out to
the-Examiner reporter in the crowd:
J "Wliat kick have you got coming? It
i vag at Andy Lawrence's suggestion Wyatt
V-nrp went in as referee."
La-t night a Call reporter sought the
managers of tbe National Athletic Club
to asceitain thedetails of this i.ffui--, aim
J. J. Groom, the other executive officer of
the club. tol<l the story.
"It was simply like th.s,'' he sad: "The
day belore the tight Andy Lawrence
The San Francisco Call.
called for Gibbs to come and see him.
! Gibbs went to his office as we had some
tickets to deliver there, and he and Law
-1 rence entered into quite a conversation.
"Lawrence told Gibbs that he under
| stood the fighters were disagreeing as to
the selection of a referee. Gibbs stated he
believed that to be about right, and added
that it made no difference if the princi
pals did not agree, that it was understood
! that in the case of a disagreement
i the club would select the referee.
â¢'Lawrence said that was right, but the
j club must select a man who would be per
j iectly fair and fearless. He then said :
11 I've got your man. Select Wyatt
i Earp. I know he's as good a man as you
1 can get, and there will be no kicking
against him. 1
"Gibbs at the time only had a general
j knowledge of wuo Earp was, having met
him casually on one occasion, but when
I Lawrence named him as referee he agreed
that he woud select him for the club if
the fighters did not settle upon auother
choice.
"That is a true statement of how we
decided upon Wyatt Earp as referee."
The close connection between Earp,
Lawrence and the referee matter is shown
by an incident that occurred the day after
tbe fight.
Lawrence, accompanied, as usual, by
Earp, called on Fitzsimmons at the Bald
win. Fitz was courteous to his visitors,
and, in the course cf a conversation, asked
I Earp to describe the blow which the latter
I claimed was foul. The referee did so, and
Bob, after thinking a moment, said:
"Let us illustrate t' is matter."
He rang up a bellboy, who happened to
be about Sbarkey's height, and said:
; 'Now, Mr. Earp, just place this boy in
the position Sharkey was in when he got
the puncii."
Earp did so and Bob then said, "Place
me as I was at that time."
When this had been accomplished to
Eurp's satisfaction Bob remarked:
"Now, Mr. Earp, don't you see that as
we are iiow placed I could not have struck
Shnrkey as you describe?"
Earp studied the situation a moment,
looked confused, and finally said:
"Well, 1 guess the positions must have
been different."
Bob looked at the referee, whose eyes
were averted, fora moment and then said,
"Yes, I think so."
The visitors took their departure very
soon afterward.
TO THE GRAND JURY.
Sharkey, Earp and Others Will Be
Charged With Conspiracy.
Colonel H. I. Kowalsky, the attorney
for Fitzsimmons, does not mince words
when he speaks of the recent pugilistic
robbery.
"It was a clear and dirty theft," he said
yesterday. "It was prearranged and the
men mixed up in it were Sharkey, Lynch,
Earp and some gamblers. But they will
not get away with the money il there is
any law in this land.
"I have advised with Dave Freidenrich,
and he agrees with me that there was
conspiracy to defraud not only Fitzsim
mons but the public. This is a serious
charge, as it is a felony punishable by im
prisonment in the penitentiary. The
whole matter will be brought to the atten
tion of the Grand Jury and I hope indict
ments will be found aeainst the men who
carried out this high-handed outrage.
"The general story of the steal is al
ready public property, but there are bush
els of other things which we have
in our possession and which go to prove
positively that Lynch, Sharkey and Earp
had the whoie thing fixed so tdat Fitzsim
mons and his faction could not possibly
win."
THE BANK ENJOINED.
Lynch Could Not Cash the Check
and Was Angry.
The filing of the suit for the purse by
Fitzsimmons was ' followed yesterday by
the serving of an injunction on the Anglo-
California Bank preventing it from paying
ever the money.
Manager Lilienthal is mindful of the
power and majesty of the law, and he was
loaded lor b?ar, -pugilists or anything else
when Lynch, the manager of the sailor
pug, called yesterday morning and de
manded payment on ,the ', certified', check
that represents the purse in the tight. .
Lynch was accompanied by J. J. Groom,"

one of the owners of the National Athletic
Club.
"We want that money and want it
now," said Lynch, flourishing the check
and red in the face with excitement. "We
are here to demand our rights."
"Tbe club has withdrawn its objection
to the payment of the check," interjected
Groom, "and as far as we are concerned
you may honor the check."
"But the bank is informed." said Teller
Stinson. "that steps have been taken to
prevent our pacing your check."
"Never mind what you understand,"
shouted Lynch, "give me the money. It
is ours and you will have to give it up."
The teller looked nettled, but merely
answered, "See Mr. Lilienthal if you want
any further information on the subject."
Lynch was even more emphatic in his
demands when the manager appeared, and
received a still more forcible setback.
"The bank bas been ordered by. the
court not to pay the check," he said, "and
we will not disobey the injunction. I
have referred the matter to my lawyer
and he advises me not to pay your
demand. Under his instruction I will
refuse to pay the money to any one except
upon an order of co\. rt.
By this time Lynch was wild with
anger. "You are unjustly withholding
tiais money," be said, "and I intend to
force you to make payment on my check.
If you do not accept this order now I will
bring suit against you for damages. The
club has agreed that this money should be
paid to Sharkey and I have the check for
the purse, yet in the face of all this you
ignore our demand. In law you are liable
for withholding our money and we will
brine you to time for it"
"Bring suit whenever you get ready,"
said Mr. Lilienthal. -We have acted on
tbe advice of our attorney and shall de
fend our position in the courts."
"I'll sue you for big damages," shouted
Lynch as be strode out of the bank with
knitted brows.
SHARKEY'S OPPONENTS.
He Says Corbett Is Clever, but
Cannot Hit.
Tom Sharkey last night gave his im
pressions as to the relative merits of Fitz
sin'mons and Corbett. Sharkey is still in
bed, and between puffs at his cigar told
what he thinks of the two big fellows.
"Fitzsimmons is the harder hitter of the
two," said the sailor, "but Corbett is
much the cleverer, rie does not take the
chances Fitz does. He never goes in and
mixes things up, but depends on landing
at long range and getting away without a
return. He is quicker on his feet than
Fitz. too, but his blows lack steam.
"However, Fitz has only two blows that
hurt. They are nis rieht and left swings.
His straight leads and short-arm punches
thai people talk about did not do me any
damage.
"I am willing to fight anybody before
the club offering the bieerest purse. 1 bar
no man, but will meet Maher, Corbett or
any man. I will not, however, enter the
ring again before February, as 1 want to
rest a month before going into training
for another contest."
Sharkey, when seen in his room at the
Windsor Hotel shortly after 10 o'clock
last night, remarked that he is "doing
pretty well, slept all right last nichtÂ°

IN THE NAME OF CHRISTIAN CHARITY.
Prominent Gtizens Send a Letter to President Qeveland Demand
ing Recognition for the Cubans*
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Dec. 4â The following letter addressed tb the President and signed by the committee appointed at
the mass-meeting of Cuba sympathizers held in this city on the 21st nit. was mailed on Wednesday. It bears the signa
tures of Hon. John B. O'Mara, Lieutenant-Governor of Missouri; Hon. Isaac M. Sturgeon, City Comptroller; Colonel
Roberts. McDonald; I. N. Milner, Street Commissioner of St. Louis; Captain Koaser Romer, who holds a commission
in the liberating army; and John Cahill, editor of the pan-American paper El Commercio del Valle, who had seven
months of severe experience with the Spanish Government in Cuba during the Crespedes rebellion in Cuba from 1866
to 1873:
Grover Cleveland, Presidentâ Sin: The press reports that have been published for months past and are being daily published
from Cuba indicate that the war being waged by the Cuban people for liberty on tne one side and by the forces of the Spanish Govern
ment for their subjugation on the other, has degenerated Into a bloody and merciless system of extermination in which women,
children, the aged and infirm and other non-combatants are subjected to inhuman, barbarous treatment by the Spanish soldiery.
While we are disposed to discredit the enormity of the crimes reported and make due allowance for the disposition to magnify their
importance, the proceedings in Cuba during the ten years. 1868 to 1878, all of which have been unfortunately too well verified,
form valid grounds for the belief that most of the atrocities are actually committed. You cannot be oblivious to the cruel character
of the government which condemned, executed and allowed to be horribly mutilated the bodies of the gallant Critterden and his
companions in 1851 and similarly treated about 100 of our fellow-citizens under the leadership of Captain Fry in 1878; of the
â¢cores of American citizens who have been shot, imprisoned and deported from Cuba to Spanish dungeons in Africa, their properties
confiscated and their families left helpless and deprived of support.
Neither are you unfamiliar with the fact that in the ten yearis' war referred to American property aggregating nearly $100,000,000
in value was destroyed, used and sequestered by the Spaniards and with the exception of the Mora claim, none of our citizens thus
Injured and outraged have had the slightest satisfaction from the government of Spain.
In the name of Christian charity we appeal to you, in the name of humanity and American civilization .to make effective the
repeatedly expressed will of the vast majority of our fellow-citizens by granting to the Cuban people the rights of belligerents which we
believe will at once mollify the horrors of this war and tend to its speedy termination.
partly by the same bathrobe in which he
entered the ring.
Several friends were seated near the bed
side, among them a very counterpart of
the gladiator, a little taller man than
Sharkey, but with the unmistakable Shar
key features. He smiled grimly as he re
marked:
"I'm Tom's brother." Tom himself dio
not smile, though he asserted in a semi
hopeful way: "They say I'll be up this
day wpek. I can only rest in one position
now; it hurts to lie any other way." His
left upper lip was swollen and cut, his left
cheekbone swollen and discolored, bis left
eyebrow stitched together in a zigzag line
throughout its length, and his bead en
circled by a large white elotb bandage
that he declared was to protect his leit
ear, which it had been necessary to lance
that afternoon in order to reduce an ab
normal swelling.
EARP WENT SECURITY.
Agreed to Pay Attorney's Fees for
Bunko S'.?9rers.
If Referee Wyatt Earp g'-*; any of tbe
spoils of tbe Sharicey- Fitzsimmons fight,
as is alleged, be will tind a writ of execu
tion staring him in the face just about as
soon as it can be levied upon him. Judge
J. G. Swinnerton of Stockton is the man
who wants the money, and he has secured
such a document by which he will attempt
to recover his fees in a bunko steering case
tried here a year ago, for which fees Earp
went security for the defendants.
Stockton's great "gold brick" case was
one of tne most interesting ever tried in
the State. Three professional confidence
men, Crooked Mouth Green, Smith and
Brown, swindled Farmer Brack of Lodi
out of $2000 by the same old game of the
tin box and rocks. They were captured
by Sheriff Cunningham end the case came
to trial. t
Attorney Jimmy Long of this City repre
sented the men at the preliminary exam
ination, by which they were he d to an
swer with bonds fixed at $30,000 each.
Judge Swinnerton, who is known as one
of the ablest lawyers in the State, was
asKed to represent the bunko steerers in
the Superior Court and he' refused unless
his fees could be secured.
Judge Swinnerton defended the men
and got them off on an extremely light
sentence, but the fees have never been
forthcoming. No one knew who had
trone security for the fees, and for the
first time it is now generally known that
it was Bad Man Earp.
Those persons here who dropped their
money on Sharkey, while admitting that
it is not the safest thing in the world to
impugn Earp's honesty when he has a
45-caliber Colt's revolver a foot lont; in his
jeans, are nevertheless asking what con
nection he could have had with three
professional crooks, and they are agreed
that in the light of circumstances the
affair does not reflect any honor on him
in connection with the recent affair which
is now exciting the sporting world.
EARP IN COURT.
fteferee Appears on a Criargre of
Carrying a Concealed Weapon.
Wyatt Earp, the referee of the Sharkey-
Fitzsimmons prizefight, answered yester
day in Police Court 4 to the charge oi
carrying a concealed weapon. Earp was
represented by Frank Kelly, a Southern
Pacific lawyer, and apparently treated tbe
whole matter with indifference.
The referee was arrested Thursday on
complaint of Police Captain Wittman,
who took a murderous-looking revolver
from him in the prizering in Mechanics' Pa
vilion. There is evidence in the form of
the "gun," as well as the interesting
story tbat Captain Wittman will tell in
court about noticing Earp's weapon pro
truding under his coat, and then ordering
him to give up the Arizona instrument
while Earp was officiating in the ring.
Tbe examination yesterday was con
tinued at the request of Attorney Kelly
until Tuesday. In the meantime Earp is
at liberty on bail of $50, but he does not
"carry a gun."
NEEDHAM'S TIPS.
Wired Seattle Friends to Bet Every
thing: on Sharkey.
SEATTLE, Wash., Dec. 3.â A cry of
"fake" has been going up among those
interested in pugilistic matters in this city
since the Sharkey - Fitzsimmons fight.
The claim is made w'th much vÂ»bemence
that at ieaat one of the contestants in this
much-heralded mill entered into a well
planned bunko scheme to fleece the pub
lic.
Danny Needham, Sharkey's trainer, has
many warm personal friends in this city.
To these he sent urgent telegrams yester
day afternoon, in some messages saying:
"Bet all you have got on Sharkey to win,"
and 'Bet Sharkey to win," and "^barkey
will win; bet on him; never quit," and
like expressions.
It is significent tbat the recipients of
these messages read them between the
lines and as meaning more than Need
ham's mere assertion that the marine
could best the lanicy Fitz. They took the
tip and oet {heir money accordingly. Even
before the fight commenced there was talk
of "fake."
HARVEY DENIES IT.
Says He Had No Hand In the Rob-
bery of Fitz.
Joe Harvey, the bookmaker who has
been mentioned by Riley Grannan as being
in conversation with Wyatt Earp shortly
after the latter's selection as referee, and
who, it is claimed, furnished the capital
on the SharKey end of the battle after the
alleged "fixing," explained his position
last evening to Police Commissioner Guast
at the Baldwin.
"I bet tbe sum total of $600 on Sharkey,"
he said. "I did so, to some extent, upon
the impression my horse- trainer had that
Sharkey was a sure winner.
"If tnere is any one who can show me
where more than $40 was bet in my boots
at the racetrack I will return the
money. And if the losers can show that
I put up $5000 or $6000 as the papers have
claimed I will donate the money to some
charity.
"Do you think that I would have bet
only $600 if I had known the thing was
'fixed'? I would have either let the whole
thing alone or else I'd bet $5000 to $6000
and won enough for a good Christmas
present.
"I am very sorry I'm drawn into this
affair. I will state this, however, I ttiink
that Wyatt Earp would have done a great
deal better to have stepped down and out
when Martin Julian accused him of being
'fixed' be lore the fight. He could have
gone to Fitzsimmons and Julian after the
battle and given them a piece of his mind
for the way they spoke."
CARROLL'S WINNINGS.
The Lightweight Who Seldom Bets
Is Money In on the Fight.
Jimmy Carroll is known as one of the
most cautious men in town when it comes
to making a wager. In fact, there are few
that have ever known him to bet at all.
And yet the veteran ringster claims to
bave won considerable money on the
Fitzsimmons-Sharkey contest, under what
appear to be, from his own statements,
rather peculiar conditions.
"Yes," he said, the evening of the fight,
in the company of several, "I won a bar
rel of money in this fight. I bet tbat
Sharkey would iast the ten rounds, al
though I believed then and do now that
Fitz is the greatest fighter on earth."
"How is it," he was asked, "that you
came to make tbe bet if you thought Fitz
simmons so good a man?"
"Well," said Jimmy, "I guess I knew
what I was doing."
"Do you think Fitz fouled Sharkey?"
"From where I was I did not see it, but
I was too far back. I will admit that the
referee should not have awarded Bharkey
the fight till after a surgical examina
tion."
In view of these statements of Carroll
and the fact tnat he seldom bets, it looks
very much as if be realized be had a sure
thing.
NOW CORBETT AND FITZ.
The Olympic Club Takes Active
Measures to Match Them.
la view of the unsatisfactory outcome
of the Fitzsimmons-Sharkey con'.est, the
Olympic Club has reached the conclusion
that a star feature of the tragedy would
be a match between Bob and Corbett, and
the first pull in tut wires to match the
two men was made last night.
The matter was quietly talked over
among a few at first, and culminated in
Superintendent W. J. Kennedy and How
ard Taylor, the club leader, going down
to see the Australian at tbe Baldwin Ho
tel early in the evening. He was found,
however, to have gone with Julian and
his wife over to Sausalito.
Tbe board of directors of the club met
last night and the proposition was put to
them by Taylor. It met with such favor
tbat Taylor was empowered to see what
can be done in the matter to-day.
Superintendent Kennedy, acting for the
club, sent a telegram to Corbett late last
night inquiring if be would meet Fitz
simmons here under the auspices of the
Olympic CJub in the near future. An an
swer is expected sometime to-day.
Taylor will go to Sausalito and see Fitz
simmons to-day in regard to meeting Cor
bett. The lanky conqueror of Sharkey is
said to be, and bas frequently expressed
himself in this City, as willing to meet
"Pompadour Jim" at any time a match
can be arranged.
If Corbett' s reply is favorable there is
every prospect that the respective ad
mirers of the two fighters will learn who
is tbe superior.
Fitz to Be In Court.
Superior Judge Sanderson, at the in
stance of a collection agency, has issued a
writ of examination for Bob Fitzsimmons,
commanding him to appear in court and
tell of his belongings.
Fitz will be in Justice Groozinger's court
at 10 o'clock this morning with nis attor
ney to go through the ordeal.
Tbe amount involved is $904 40, for
which lightweight Jimmy Carroll has a
judgment.
The debt was contracted while Fitz was
training for his last fight with Maber, and
is for personal services.
Paying Bets. *
The paying-off of the bets on the fight
began at Corbett's poolrooms yesterday
afternoon. There was neaily $29,000 in
the box and it was soon in the hands of
those who held Sharkey tickets.
Corbett Wants to Flarht.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 4.â James J.
Corbett had something to say to-ni^ht to
the patrons of a local theater concerning
the Fitzsimrnons-Sharkey mill. Between
the acts he came to tbe front of the stage
and said: "Last night Mr. Fitzsimmons
and Mr. Sharkey had a contest in San
Francisco, and I expected tnat Mr. Fitz
simmons would win in short order, but, to
mv surprise, he did not. I don't wish to
express any opinion as to the outcome of
the contest or of the decision of the
referee. I will say this, however, that I
stand ready to meet either Fitzsimmons
or Sharkey â first come, first served â two
weeks after papers are signed and at any
place on earth, because I want it settled
first and for all time who is the best man
in the world."
LAST OF A BAD GANG GONE.
Dynamite Dick, the Notorious Desperado of
Oklahoma, Slain by a Posse of
Officers.
GUTHRIE, 0. T., Dec. 4.â A man hunt
that has been in progress since last Sep
tember, when Bill Doolin and Dick Goul
sen, alias Dynamite Dick, escaped from
the Guthrie jail, ended in an encounter
to-day near Kildare, in which Dynamite
Dick was killed and Ben Cravens, another
member of the gang of outlaws, was
wounded. The pursuing posse came upon
the two unexpectedly near Kildare at 8
o'clock this morning and opened fire.
Dynamite Dick was shot and mortally
wounded, and Cravens surrendered after
receiving a shot in the right arm.
There are rewards aggregating $1000 for
the capture of Dynamite Dick, who is
guilty of half a dozen murders, and $300
is offered for the arrest of Cravens. The
prisoner and the corpse wjll be taken to
Guthr.e by Deputy Marshal Cox and his
deputies who madÂ« the capture. It Is
hinted that Cravens, being tired of the
chase, had given information of his chief's
movements, and was to be dealt with
lightly. The death of Dynamite DiÂ«;k re
moves the last or the gaug of desperadoes
that have terrorized the settlers in the Ter
ritory since its first settlement.

Liverraore Herald to-day, giving the
views of Editor Eliis:
The Herald may be a little late in coming to
the front with an airship story, but never
the'ess it has oue. and us for its authenticity
no man in AlÂ«meda County can doubt. The
parties who witnessed ttrs remcrkable phe
nomenon are none other than the Key. John
Kijby of Oakland, presiding elder of the Oak
land dMrlc:, ani Rev. Hugh Copeland.
|>Rev. Mr. Kirby was In Livermore Wednesday
of this week and in the presence of Rev. Mr.
Alexander, DHStor of the Methodist Church,
and Madison Beck of the firm of Beck & Co.,
made this statement:
"On the evening of November 22 Rev. Hugh
Copeland and myself were ridinc in a busgy
in tbe vicinity of Knights Ferry in Stanislaus
County. We were just crossing a bridge when
our attention was riveted to an object about a
quarter of a mile ahead of us. It appeared at
first like a huge ball of lire that rose from the
earth.
"We were traveling in a southwesterly direc
tion at the time and stopped our buggy to
gaze in wonderment upon this startling and
unexpected scene. It sailed along above the
surface of the ground for probably 100 yards,
th*n gradually raised higher and higher. Had
it con tinned its course when we first saw it, it
would have p&ssed almost directly above us,
but instead made a half circle to tbe west and
north and was about the same distance when
it reached a point opposite to us as it was
when we first noticed It. Before it passed us
we could plainly see two lights in front and at
right angles of the firing machine, and as it
wag going by we saw a light, that was not visi
ble before, attached to and at the rear of the
object. We watched it for some time before
continuing our journey. It could not have
been a meteor because it did not go to the
earth, but skimmed along rcpidly.
"Had I been alone I mig.it have believed
that my eyes deceived me, but there was Mr.
Copeland, who witnessed the came scene, a;id
there is no possibility of our being mistaken.
I had believed that tbe successful navigation
of an airship was beyond the reach of mortal
skill, but I look at it in a different light now.
I do not claim, mind you, that wh&t we saw
that night *as a genuine airship, but the
natural question that arises is, if it was not an
airship, what was it? I saw enough to convince
me that the papers have no grounds to picture
this phenomenon in the light of a burlesque.
When we reached Stockton the following day
the papers were full of descriptive accounts
of an airship in Yuba County that pictured
exactly what we had seen on November 22."
OAKLAND, Cal.. Dec. 3.â Tbe Rev.
John Kirby, presiding elder of the Oak
land district for the past two years, and
pastor of the Pane-street M. E. Church
of Alameda six years previous to
that, was interviewed at his home on
Pmrk street, Alameda, to-night. He re
peated and confirmed tbe story as told
above and added: "After reading the ac
counts of the airship in The Call I
clipped them and forwarded them to Mr.
Copeland at Oakdale. To-day I received
a reply in which he says: 'If there is an
airship we shall share in the glory. People
in Oakdale saw it on the same night.' "
STRANDED NEAR FRESNO.
The Great Airship Caught In a Cur-
rent and Sent Southward.
FRESNO, Cal., Dec. 4.â The skepticism
of the people of this city regarding the
existence of the airship has been removed
largely by a strange statement of George
Jenninsrs, one of the proprietor* of the bar
in the Grand Central Hotel. He is a thor
oughly reliable man and there is good
ground to give credence to his story. He
avers that he is practicing no deception.
Mr. Jennings asserts that there is no ques
tion that an airship exists and that it has
been sailing through the skies as reported.
He talked with the inventor and the craft
is now somewhere in Fresno County, not
far from this city.
Mr. Jennings waa Interviewed by a
Call correspondent this evening and
made the following statement: "Yester
day shortly before noon a man appeared
at my place of business and inquired for
me. The stranger was covered with dust
and travel-stained. I recognized him as
an old friend, whose name I cannot pos
sibly give at present It is true the air
ship is in Fresno County, just where I do
not myself know. This man who was in
here is one of the inventors. He told me
that the trip to this county was involun
tary upon the part of the men in the air
ship. In other words the machine came
itself aud ihey couldn't stop it.
''His statement was that they were fly
ing, as usual, around Contra Coeta County
hills and rose to a height of about 1000
feet. Suddenly the airship struck a cur
rent of air and refused to answer its steer
ing gear. It was borne rapidly southward
against all efforts to change its course
until suddenly the current of air seemed
to lessen and tbe machine once more be
came manageable. The men aboard at
once descended and new about looking
for a hiding place, which they at length
found.
"My friend told me that the airship was
made principally of aluminum, and that
the rising and falling was accomplished
by improved aeroplanes, while the mo
tive power was electricity. He says the
machine is perfect, except for the fact that
at times it refuses to be steered in a given
direction, and that It wilt not stand still
in the air. He has gone to San Francisco
and will return with some material and
men probably to-night. He said if the
news from Washington was satisfac'ory,
he would bring his airship over to FreÃno
where every one could see it.
â  '1 know the man well," concluded Mr.
Jennings. "He bad no reason to tell me
such a story if it was not true. He had no
business here, knows no one but myself
and left without asfcing any favors More
over, he wanted the matter kept quiet."
OVER SELMA.
Reputable Citizens View a Strange
Aerial Traveler.
SELMA, Cal., Dec. 4.â The airship, or
some other aerial traveler of like appear
ance, passed over Selma last night be
tween 9 and 10 o'clock. It was seen by
many reputable citizens. N. W. Stewart,
grain merchant, went to the door of his
residence about 9:30 o'clock and saw a
light approaching from the west. It had
ihe appearance of a locomotive headlight,
and was apparently about 150 feet above
tbe earth.
Mr. Stewart called to his family, and all
saw the wonderful light pass over tbe
. town and disappear in an easterly direc
tion. It was traveling at about the speed
o> a passeneer-irain.
G. S. Reichard, attorney-at-law, and
many other persons also saw the remark

There is no question about an airship
having passed over this part of Fiesno
County last nitht.
THE WOMAN IN IT.
Strange and Circumstantial Story
of a Sailor Passenger.
SAN LUIS OuISPO, Cal., Dec. 4 â
"William Gordon reached tins town this
morning. He states that ne is a native oi
boutti Carolina and a .truthful person, a
graduate of Berkeley, but recently a sailor
and just from New York.
His story is tnat yesterday evening^
about 9 o'clock, be was at Indio, and re
sponded to the inquiries of a stranger who
was looking for some one abie to splice a
rope. Gordon, being a sailor, offered hia
services, which were accepted, and he fol
lowed the man who claimed to have a hay
ba'.ing outbt about a mile from town to a
place where he found a cigar-stiaped struc
ture about 80 feet long and 25 feet in
diameter. The structure was standing on
projections, and bad nnder Jit two propel
lers, five-biadod, say 15 feet across. There
was a huge tail, which served as a rudder,
of which the tiller-ropes had parted. Gor
don spliced them.
The structure was of metal. There were
a number of windows and two doors. The
interior was divided into compartments
and the motive power, which the cantain
stated was compressed air, seemed to
operate machinery contained in a great
case and controlled by levers.
Gordon was invited to come along and
did so. He was given the rudder, operated
by a wheel, and followed the courses given
him as shown by compass. They rose in
the air to a great height, probably 3000
feet, and took a northerly course and
traveled at enormous speed. In a few
hours they passed over Los Angeles,
easily knowc by its great number of
lights, and then sped over Ventura, Santa
Barbara and other places, and about 3
o'clock this morning settled down in a
place in the mountains about eight miles
southeast of this city.
Here the manager of the airship an
nounced his intention of stopping awhile
and Gordon was sent for water, but after
going a short distance he turned and dis
covered the strange vessel disappearing.
The airship man, Gordon says, was of
swarthy appearance an i spoKe Spanish to
the only companion he had, a woman.
A Fake of Showmen.
It developed yesterday that the cigar
shaped galvanized iron tank, constructed
to resemble an airship, which was found
late Thursday night in a gulch near the
Almshouse, is a "fake" creation. It was
carted to the point where found m order

REDUCED THE ALLOWANCE
R. C. Gocdspeed Will Not Be
Permitted to Spend $250
a Month.
Jndge Crff?y Decides That the Estates
of Minors Must Be Con
served.
R. C. Goodspeed's application for $250 a
month as family allowance for the support
of his two minor children received a very
severe shock yesterday, when Judge Cof
fey decided that he should have not more
than $50 a month for that purpose, to be
paid only as the estate of their deceased
mother could readily supply the money.
Samuel M. Suortridge, attorney for the
executor of the will of Mrs. Goodspeed,
opposed the allowance of $250 a month for
the support of the two young children, on
the ground that it is the natural and legal
duty of a father to support his minor chil
dren, without recourse to the children's
estate. This estate, Mr. Shortridze con
tended, must be husbanded and be deliv
ered to them on their attaining their ma
jority. This is the accepted rule where
the father has sufficient resources to prop
erly maintain the children and nothing can
be taken from their estate except when tbe
father is shown to be without means. To
support his position Mr. Sli ort rid &c cited
authorities from toe English courts and
from several courts of highest adjudica
ture in the United States.
In tbe present case the testimony
showed that Mr. Goodspeed, who is the
legally appointed guardian of his own
children, has a fixed income sufficient for
the support of himself and bis children,
and further tnat he had paid $125 a month
for their support for several years beiore
his wife's death, such payment beine
made by order of the court which granted
a divorce to Mrs. Goodspeed.
Attorney C. F. Hanlon, also speaking for
tl;e executor of Mrs. Goodspeed's will, in
timated that it would be wasteiul to al
low Mr. Goodspeed to handle so much
money over and above what was actually
necessary for the support of the children.
The testimony showed that Mr. Goodspeed
is inclined to favor the cause of the older
children wo are contesting toe wil! of
Mrs. Goodspeed. Tha.t contest, if success
ful, would decrease the interest of the
minor children in the estate of their
mother. It would De unfair to these
minors to have surplus funds put in the
hands of their father, when the same
would be employed to injure their own
interests.
According to Mr. Heggerty's idea, the
supplying of funds for th - support of sur
viving children is one of the most sacred
and imperative duties of a mother's estate.
He objected to the casting of aspersions
on the motives of his client, Mr. Good
sjeed.
Mr. Shortridge declared that no asper
sions were cast on that gentleman's mo
tives. The only thing suggested by bis
associate was a reference to the testimony
which disclosed that Mr. Goodspeed was
inclined to support his elder children, and
wouid not stand by his minor children in
the contest of the will.
Judge Coffey made a suggestion that
under the decree of divorce Mr. Good
speed was called for to contribute to a
fund for the s-upport of the minor children.
Mr. Heggerty thought a divorce ends
with the death of either of the parties
thereto, but Judge Coffey replied that the
Supreme Court had expressed a different
view; that the conditions provided by the
decree of divorce remain in force until
modified by a court of competent jurisdic
tion. The court supposes that the fund
contemplated by the divorce decree is be
ing piled up somewhere, but the question
here is the present care of the children.
Judge Coffey said that tbe position
touching the duty and responsibility of
the lather to care for his children was cor
rect. Mr. Goodspeed had expressed a
willingness to contribute his share for the
maintenance of these minors, and it ap
peared that he was able to pay $50 a
momh. Tnis might be sufficient to pro
vide them with the bare necessaries of
life, but in view of the condition or life of
these children they are entitled to more
than a meager support. It was therefore
ordered that $50 a month should be al
lowed to the cniidren from the estate, in
addition to the $50 a month which the
father bad agreed to contrioute.
This disposition of the matter appeared
to please all parties to the discussion, it
being stated that tbe money should be
paid at the convenience oi the executor of
Mrs. Goodspeed's estate.
THOSE DYED HORSES.
Mrs. Joan Hunter Acquits Captaiu
Thomson of Blame.
The publication in last Saturday's Call
of the attempt to palm off a pair of dyed
black horses on the millionaire widow of
the late David Hunter caused quite a sen
sation in the sporting community.
This attempted fraud was all the more
reprehensible because it was attempted
upon a iiberal and public-spirited lady
who, it was considered, would iall an
easy victim to the trickery of an un
scrupulous horse-sharp. But, fortunately,
Mrs. Hunter is a shrewd woman and can
not be easily imposed UDon.
As regards the participation of Captain
Thomson of the park police in the at
tempt to impose upon the lady Mrs.
Hunter wishes to exonerate that gentle
man from any part in the attempted
fraud and says that Captain Thomson is

that it was the captain who suggested to
her to send for a veterinary surgeon to ex
amine the dyed animals.
She also gives him credit for observine a
portion of the horse's nose where the dye
had been applied af ler her suspicions had
been aroused to the shady look of the
supposed thoroughbreds.
Captain Thompson, when given an op
portunity to explain from whom the
ayed animals came, declined to talk, and
characterized the whole story as false from
beginning to end.
CONFERENCE OF CHARITIES
The Rev. Jacob Voorsaneer and Dr.
W. W. Bolton on Almsgiving With
out Investigation.
The second meeting of the San Fran
cisco Conference of Charities took place
at the Occidental Hotel yesterday, quite a
number of ladies and gentlemen interested
in charities being present.
The subject of discussion was "Alms
giving Without Investigation." Addresses
were made by the Rev. Jacob Voorsanger
and the Rev. W. W. Bolton, and the
various persons in the audience participa
ted in the discussion. It was argued quite
strenuously on one side that it was wrong
to give to the undeserving, that it tended
to keep such persons in idleness and to
make them more and more, unscrupulous.
Such persons become parasites on the
community. With them getting a living
without work was a mere matter of wit,
and of preying on those whose sympathies
could be aroused.
Equally strong were the arguments of
the opposition. It was maintained that
as a general thine it was best to give, for
no one could immediately know what
gnawing hunger might not be the cause
of the request for alms. A few cents
would not make any difference to the
giver, and mint work great good, through
relief of suffering.
At the conclusion of the discussion tea
and cakes were served, and a half hour
was spent in social conversation.
FAVOR THE DINGLEY BILL.
Recent Action of the California Wool
Association.
On November 17, at a meeting of the
California Wool Association, resolutions
were passed favoring the immediate pas
sage of the Dingley bill, and a committee
was appointed to bring the resolutions be
fore our delegation in Congress. On
November 24, at the annual meeting, the
following officers were elected:
Charles H. Abbott, president; James E.

retary; F. P. McLennan, treasurer.
The report of the committee was as fol
lows:
To the Senators and Representatives of the State
of Ca ifornia in Congress: At a meeting of the
California Wool Protective Association, held
on the 17th inst., resolutions were passed
favoring ite immediate adoption of tbe
emergency tariff, known al o as tbe Dingley

DUNBAR IS IN PRISON.
The Young Man Who Got Money
in the Name of the
Press Club.
He Was Traced From This City to
Fresno and Arrested in San
Jose Thursday.
Alexander R. Dunbar, the young man
whose special line of business seemed to
be a sustained effort at living by his wits
as a compiler of directories and the like,
was rounded up yesterday in San Jose
and given a cell in the City Prison here.
He is c arced with obtaining money by
false pretenses.
Dunbar is the same individual who re
cently went about town representing him
self to be a canvasser for the Press Club
and received various sums of money upon
the pretensions he made. The police are
of the opinion that he collected several
hundred dollars in this way. He carried
on the scheme with bis friend, Frank
Stone, who pretended to be a member of
the Press Club and corroborated every
thing that Dunbar said.
The story told to banters, merchants
and professional men was that the club
was in dire financial difficulties and
needed money to save it from ruin. Dun
bar claimed to be authorized by the board
of managers of the club to collect money
from generons citizens. He succeeded in
almost every instance. But the fact soon
became public through the newspapers
that Dunbar was swindling everybody he
approached on this proposition. And then
he took his departure suddenly from ban
Francisco. Stone also disappeared, and
has since managed to elude the police,
who want him in this connection.
The special case on which Dunbar is
now in prison is obtaining $25 from C. A.
Becker, president of the German Savings
Bank, on account of the Press Club. The
signature to the receipt is written J. W.
Longmore, which is said to be a name as
sumed by Dunbar. The money was got
November 5. About the same time Dun
bar got $5 from Mr. Alvord and $5 from
Mr. Brown of the Bank of California on
representing that the money was for the
club.
Soon afterward Dunbar went to Fresno,
where it is, said he forgot to pay several
small bills and tried to move his valise
from the Hughes Hotel with a long rope.
He then went to San Jose, whence Detec
tive Ross Whitaker brought him to this
City.
Dunbar was sullen and would not dis
cuss his arrest. Meanwhile the police are
looking for more evidence against him.
Frank Stone, who was associated with
Dunbar, was taken in custody last night
by Private Detective H. Stilwell, who
turned him over to Police Detectives
Whitaker and Seymour. Stone was taken
to the City Prison and there detained
pending an investigation.

ACCIDENTALLY SHOT HIMSELF.
John Devlin Fatally Wounded While
Cleaning a Revolver.
John Devlin, a laundryman by occupa
tion, died last evening at hia home, 121
Fourteenth street, from the result of a shot
through the body, accidentally received
while the deceased was cleaning a re
volver last Wednesday afternoon.
Shortly after the accident occurred a
physician, Dr. Gallwey, was called to at
tend to the injured man. He immediately
reached the conclusion that the wound
was fatal.
A few honrs prior to Devlin's death he
made an ante-mortem statement to his
physician and a priest, stating that the
wound was due. solely to an accident.
The case was reported to the Coroner, but
an inquest was waived. The deceased
leaves a widow and two children.
SECRETARY FRANCIS
MAKES A REPORT
Millions of Acres of Land
Could Be Reclaimed
by Irrigation.
More Economy Urged in the
Payment of Pensions to
Old Soldiers.
Recommendations of Predecessors in
Reference to Bond -Aided Rail*
roads Are Repeated.
"WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 4.âSecre
tary of the Interior David R. Francis hag
submitted hia annual report to the Presi
dent.
The appropriation for the last fiscal year
amounted to $157,179,656. The estimates
for the present fiscal year are about
$1,000,000 less than was appropriated last
year. The actual public domain is now
1,849,072,587 acres. The public lands still
vacant amount to over 600,000,000 acres,
not including Alaska. About 85,729,751
acres have been patented to railroads and
there are yet due railroads and wagon
roads under their grants an aggregate of
114,756.639 acres. The total acreage segre
gated from the public domain was 946,
-219.160 acres.
The Secretary deems it desirable that
oar waste acreage should be taken up by
actual bettlers, who should be given every
encouragement, and says if the rate of
settlement continues in the future as in
the past but little vacant land will be left
in thirteen years' time. He urges legisla
tion for the preservation of the forests and
states that a report will be submitted to
Congress by the Forestry Commission,
which has lately returned from a tour of
inspection.
The Dcs Moines River land grant mat
ter has been adjusted. About $188,856 in
awards was* agreed upon, of which $117,
-632 has been paid and tie remainder will
be paid at the end of this year.
Secretary Francis calls the attention of
Congress to the necessity of legislation
looking to the reclaiming of lands, and
says that of the 500,000,000 acres of arid
lands 100,000,000 might be reclaimed by
the conservative use of water, but it is im
possible for the laws in operation to con
trol the reclamation of the arid regions so
as to prevent the improvident use of water
over which the Government has no con
trol. This should be done by a system
which contemplates the reclamation of
the entire territories from a common
source of supply and the util zation of
that supply, or the adoption oi the sug
gestion of the Commissioner of the Gen
eral Land Offi ce would be a good one.
T hat is to place the lands in the control
of the States for reclamation. He briefly
mentions the difficulties between the Otoe
and Missouri Indians, which he states is a
complicated one. Ko settlement has yet
been agreed upon.
In speaking of the decision of Ids prede
cessors that the eastern terminus of the
Northern Pacific Railroad has been fixed
a* Duluth, he states that: "The effect of
this decision v/as to exclude from the
land grant of the company all lauds lying
east of Duluth tuat had been appropriated
by settlers and paid for at the double
minimum rate of $2 50 per acre upon the
assumption that they tell within the lim
its of the railroad grant and therefore
within the operation of section 2352 of the
Revised Statutes."
After the promulgation of these deci
sions numerous applications were, made
by persons who had paid the doubie mini
mum price for lands to have t. c excess of
$125 per acre refunded, pursuant to the
provisions of June 16, 1883. Inasmuch as
the railroad company had never acqui
esced in the decision of the department,
all such applications have been suspended
to await the final and authoritative loca
tion of the eastern terminus of said road
by a court of competent jurisdiction.
He has been officially informed through
counsel of the company that a suit will in
a short time be brought for that purpose.
In the meantime, while he has not ques
tioned the propriety of the ruling of the
department, he deems it the safer course
to direct the large disbursements involved
in a compliance wita the request of the
settlers.
No steps have been taken to make allot
ments to the Wichita Indians, as the act
ol Congress left this' to the discretion of
the department.
Regarding the opening of what is known
as the leased district of the Choctaw and
Chickasaw Indians, which is now before
the Court of Claims, he says that if the
allotments were made and the land
thrown open before a decision is rendered
upon the claim of the Choctaws and
ChickaÃaws the Government would be
placing the Indians upon land under
an agreement which involved the transier
of a good title and would also be throwing
open the land to settlement, when, in
point of fact, it did not have a clear title
tnereto. He recommends that all the
Oklahoma townsite boards bs abolished.
Secretary Francis is of the opinion tnat
the free use of timber on public lands for
commercial purposes should be discon
tinued.
Un the pension question he says that
970,678 pensioners are drawing about $140,
-000,000 per annum in pensions, and the
branch of the service should be conducted
with great care and discretion. He gives
a table which shows that the total c mount
paid out by the Government in pensions
and the cost of disbursing the same dur
ing the last thirty-one year* was $2,034.
-817,769, which lack 3 only $346,712,052 of
beine equal to the high-water mark of the
interest-bearing public debt. He suggests
a number of amendments to the pension
laws, some of which have already bean
made public, notably those in regard to
pensioners resident in Germany.
One hundred and forty million dollars
is thought to be sufficient for the payment
of pensions during the next fiscal year
unless pensions are increased by further
legislation. The Secretary recommends
that from $8 to $12 per month be* granted
to all survivors of tfle Mexican war who
are wholly disabled or de-mute.
The Indians, he says, now occupy about
85,000,000 acres of land, and they should
be protected from the sinister machina
tions of unscrupulous men. He recom
mends that the Indian Bureau should be
conducted by a commission of three mem
bers, two to be civilians of different politi
cal parties and one an army officer.
Concerning the bond-aided railroads,
the Secretary summarizes the recommen
dations of hU predecessors and the result
of the litigation. He calls attention to
the fact that the tables he presents ciearly
show that the Central Pacific Railroad is
in default.
There is in default to the Government,
or unqupsiionably will be January 1 next,
when $2,432,000 additional of the Central
Pacific's indebtedness, together with
tnirty years' interest thereon, will fall
due and must be redeemed by the Gov
ernment. On January 1, 1897, $6,640,000
additional bonds of Union Pacific will
mature, interest on same, $11,952,000. will
he then due, and if not paid, the Union
Pacific will unquestionably be in default.
He .has, therefore, declined to patent
iands to the Union Pacific Railroad or the
Central Pacific Railroad except in case
where it can be shown that the lands
for which patents are asked have been
sold to bona-ride purchasers. The Central
Pacific Railroad was, on June 30, 1896, in
default to tbe Government to the extent
of $288,143 66 on its "bond and interest"
and its 'Sinking fund" account.
Secretary Francis gives the total in
debtedness of the several bond-aided com
panies to tbe United States on June 30,
1896, as follows:
Union Pacific (including Kansas Pa
cific), principle of bonds issued, $33,539.
-512, on which interest has accrued to the
amount ol $57,071,757 46. If on this there
should be credited the sum of $38,611,
-070 53, applied to the "bond and interest"
and ''sinking fund" accounts and interest
on the latter, the balance of the debt on
tbe above date would be $52,000, 198 93.
Central Pacific (including Western Pa
cific) â Principal oi bonds issued, $27,855,
-680; interest accrued, $46,593,478 98; total
credits, consisting ot "oond and interest"
and "sinking fund" accounts, with inter
est on the latter, $16,167,149 56; balance of
debt (if these credits be allowed), $58,282,
-009 42.
Sioux City and Pacific â Principal ,of
bonds, $1,628,320: interest accrued, $2,
-734,387 09: credits on account of trans
portation, $246,659 49; balance of debt,
$4,116,047 60.
Central Branch Union Pacific â Princi
pal of bonds issued, $1,600,000; accrued
interest, $2,778,608 26; credits, $642,884 88;
balance of debt, $3,735,723 38.
The report of the Commissioner of Rail
roads gives full information concerning
the physical and financial conditions of
the roadi. He reviews the legislation
pending before Congress for the settlement
of the debts of the Pacific road* to the
Government, and gives a summary of the
provisions of the bills reported to Con
gress and not yet called up. After revi vy
ing other subjects the commission gives it
as its opinion that it is much better for the
Government to accept a lump sum in cash
for its claims against the roads.
The Secretary does not agree with the
contentions of the Central Pacific that
their road is not in default to tbe Govern
ment and that if it were the lauds are not
covered by the Government mortgage and
cannot be held to secure the same, on
this point Secretary Francis does not
agree with either statement and he de
clines to patent the lands to the Union
Pacific or tbe Central Pacific railroad ex
cept in case where it can be shown that
the lands for which patents are asked
have been soid to bona-fide purchasers,
and here the becretary says:
"Inasmuch as the subsidy bonds issued
by the Government to aid in the con
struction of the roads are falling due from
time to time and must be redeemed by
the Government as ihey mature, while
tne roads are unable to reimburse the
treasury for the amount so paid, and for
tbe further reason that a bill is now pend
ing in Congress providing for a funding
of this indebtedness, I deem it the part of
prudence lor this department to retain
whatever of the property of the roads it
may have in it.s possession or in its con
trol until there shall be an adjustment of
tbe amounts due tbe Government.'
The report of the Government directors
of the Union Pacific Railway Company
gives a comparative statement of earnings
and expenses for 1896 and 1895, from which
it appears that tbe slight increase in gross
earnings is more than offset by the IB
crease in operating expenses.
He refers to tbe fact that tbe act char
tering the Nicaragua Canal Company re
quires the company to make a report on
the first Monday in December in each
year to the Secretary of the Interior, to
be verified on oath by its president and
secretary. A preliminary statement has
been submitted by the canal showing how
much has been done on the canal since
August 1, 1893. The Maritime Canal Com
pany has entered into a contract with the
Nicaragua Canal Construction Company
for the construction of the canal, but tbe
latter company became financially em
barrassed in August, 1893, and subse
quently made an assignment of its con
struction contract and all its assets to the
Nicaragua Company, a corporation char
tered by the State of Vermont. The lat
ter company "has not yet found itsslf in
a position to resume tbe work of construc
tion under the contract."
The Secretary wants an extension of the
building accommodation fur his depart
ment. He closes his report by saying:
"I earnestly recommend that Congress
take immediate steps looking to the pur
chase or condemnation of a block or more
of ground adjacent or contiguous to the
Interior Department building for the erec
tion thereon of another structure to meet
the present necessities of an important
branch of the Government, which must
expand and grow with the development of
the country's resources. The area of our
country, tha variety of its products, the
diversity of its interests, tbe trade and
social relations between localities and
classes of peopie, make its internal com
merce of enormous magnitude and must
from time to time necessitate enlargement
of its existing Government bureaus and
the establishment of additional ones.
Provision for tbe accommodation thereof
should no longer be delayed.
POISONED HIS PRETTY WIFE.
J. Sidney Goodmanson, a Dentist, Is
Under Arrest and There Is Strong
Proof Against Him.
FENDER, Nebr., Dec. 4.â J. Sidney
Goodmanson, a dentist, is under arrest,
charged with poisoning his young aad
pretty wife. Mrs. Goodmanson died at
her husband's office last September under
suspicious circumstances, and the body
was sent to her former home at Tiskilwa,
111., for burial. A physician's certificate
was secured, which stated that heart dis
ease was tbe cause of deatn. A brother
and uncle of the dead woman were not
satisfied, and bad the body exhumed and
sent to the Rush Medical College, Chicago,
for examination. The chemist's report
to the Coroner's jury was that death re
sulted from strychnine poisoning. The
brother and uncle came at once to Pender,
and Goodmanson's arrest followed last
night. Goodmanson came here from Chi
cago, where he is said to bo well known.
Relatives of his wife strongly opposed the
marriaee, as it was reported that Good
man on at the time was engaged to a Chi
cago girl. Mrs. Goodmanson had $12,0U0
in her own right.

CHICAGO, 111., Dec. 4.â Rev. Judson
Smith, secretary of the American Board
of Foreign Missions, who has been in this
city lecturing at the Union Park Theologi
cal Seminary, received to-day a copy of a
cablegram which had been sent to his
oliice in Boston from an American resi
dent in Constantinople. The message
conveys intelligence of recent outrages
and massacres of Armenians by Turks in
the villages near Bitlis and in some places
remote irom that city in which 2000 chil
dren were made orphans and 600 women
confronted with widowhood and starva
tion.
The message, which is dated December
1, reads:
"Bitlis appeals on behalf of 2000 or
phans and 500 new widows, many of them
from distant homes, where husbands,
fathers and brothers were killed before
their eyes amid dreadful atrocities. They
now wander in the streets of the city beg
ging for food and clothing. The mission
aries entreat every possible influence to be
used to get means to enable them to care
for the unfortunate ones. Urgency is ex
treme. Will America sustain?"
Dr. Smith siM to a reporter for the
United Associated Presses just prior to his
departure to-night for Boston that he had
heard of other trouble iv Armenia
through his Constantinople correspond
ents but had no definite information. He
declined to make kuown the name of the
sender of the foreign message because the
agents of Turkey here were always eager
to send such information to Constantino
ple for use aerainst the informant.
AFTER THE MEAT COMBINE.
The Federal Grand Jury of Illinois Ex-
pects to Indict Four Big
Firmt.
CHICAGO, 111., Dec. 4.â The Federal
Grand Jury, which has been sitting here
for several weeks, is making another at
tempt to obtain evidence of the existence
of a beel trust among Armour, Swift, Mor
ris and the Hammond Packing Company.
The jury has asserted its ancient prerogÂ»
ative of conducting an inquiry independ
ent of the District Attorney's office. The
investigation has not the approval of
General John C. Black, the District Attor
ney, or Senator J. H. Shields of Dubuque,
who was choÂ»en by the Government to
obtain evidence against the alleged beef
trust at the time Keneaaw Landis of Chi
cago was commissioned to assist the Dis
trict Attorney in the prosecution of the
case. The attorneys are of the opinion
that there is not sufficient available testi
mony upon which to base an indictment,
but the jury has been led to believe from
statements made by one of the body, Rich
ard Collins, a wholesale meat-dealer here,
that a case can be made out against the
four firms mentioned.
The jury demanded yesterday that cer
tain witnesses be summoned, and tbe list
is said to have been made up partly by
Juror Collins and partly by the District
Attorney's office. It includes confidential
packing-house men, railroad traffic a ents
and local meat-dealers, who are said to
have been frozen out by he alleged trust.
At tbe Cutset the deputy marshals sent to
serve the subpenas met with the same
misfortune which befell them at the last
term of the court. They found the em
ployes of the packers and raiiroads absent
from the city and the owners of only two
meat markets were found.
Juror Collins is said to possess inside
knowledge of tbe operations of the al
leged tract and to have imparted it to tbe
jury. They have been told that the trust
members meet once a week and fix tbe
price of meat. After the small dealers
have done buying each trust-buyer calls
tor livestock of one class only, thus de
stroying competition in the grades. Re
bates are said to be given to those who
buy exclusively from the big packers, and
each packer had the same list. Meat
markets spring up alongside of those who
refuse to buy from the trust, according to
Collins* statement, and the outsider is
soon driven from business by cut prices,
or he is forced off his loute if he is a meat
jobber.

on" the Ist day of December, 1896, after due
Deliberation, do hereby call a non-partisan
'convention to meet at the city of Indianapolis
p'n ,'the 12th day of January, 1897, to be com
â  .posed of represen;ative business men chosen
from boards of trade, chambers of commerce,
commercial clubs or other similar commer
cial bodies in cities of eight tnousand or more
inhabitants, according to the ceusus ot 1890,
' the basi3 of representation to be as tabulated
â  and in accordance with the population of the
said cities for the purpose of considering and
suggesting such legislation as may in their
judgment be necessary to place the currency
system of the country upon a sound and per
manent basis. In behalf of this call the con
ference submits that the fact that the neces
" sity for such legislation exists is generally con
â  ceded by business zneu.
" It is the right and the duty of the business
.men of the Nation in a matter of such vital
business concern to render to this cause all
Jhe iii<l which their experience and knowl
edge can afford. They owe it to themselves as
citizens of the Republic and as a matter of
'business self-preservation to participate ac
tively and, we believe, efficiently in this
movement. The business men have been ac
cused of neglect of political duties. In ordi
nary times there may be some foundation for
tiiis ctrarge, but. at every critical juncture in
the history 01 our country when the Nation's
perpetuity, honor or general welfare was
seriously in danger they have, in the spirit of
enlightened patriotism, risen to the full
measure of their duty; and we b-'lieve that
the painful experience of the country under
the existing laws on the subject of currency
isdmouishes the business men that we have
i;ached a point where it Is their duty to take
n active part in helping the great questions
lvolved.
And we have a right to believe that a con
ention composed of broad-minded and en
ghtened business meu so earnest in the pur
nit of truth that party considerations will be
jrgottsn, conveying in the spirit of cnl:ght
ned. patriotism, can and will do much in
helping forwaid a wise and sound solution of
the currency question. We are also justified,
in the light of the recent Presidential elec
tion, in saying that the voters of the Nation
are opposed to any pi an of currency reform
involving the use of money which will place
in jeopardy the honor or the credit of our
country.
Accepting these conclusions from the recent
manifestations of public opinion, we cordially
and earnestly invite your organization to
choose and send, with proper credentials, of
representative business men to the proposed
'convention. Please appoint only those who
will attend, and report the name* of your
'delegates as soon as practicable to H. H.

CHICAGO, 111., Dec. 4. â A special from Columbia, Mo., says: Dr. Thomas
Powell claims to have made a most wonderful discovery, which, if true, will revo
lutionize medicine. He says he can inoculate the human system so as to render
it impervious to disease germs. As vaccination prevents smallpox, so his dis
covery will ward off scarlet fever, consumption, diphtheria ana every other
disease caused by germs. So confident is Dr. Powell of the value o.f his discovery
that he has written largely for scientific journals of the subject, and has himself
tested it by exposing himself to all manner of diseases. He entered this week
into an arrangement with California capitalists by which he is to be paid $9000 for
a one-third interest in the discovery. A sanitarium will be erected in Los An
geies and experiments be made.

since the election will not be impatient if
they don't receive an answer promptly.
I have four persons assisting with my
correspondence, but we are considerably
behind. The mail exceeded 2500 letters
per day for a while after the election, and
even now I could not answer the letters as
fast as they arrive if I could spend every
hour of the day at the work. Other work
prevents me giving my whole time to
correspondence. I shall do the best I can
to answer all letters as soon as possible
after receipt, and I hope the friends will
pardon the delay."'
YET UNDER THE "EVIL EYE."
Tragical Story of Sarah A/lhea Hill-
Sharon-Terry Resurrected by the
Escapades of Her Nephew.
CHICAGO, 111., Dec. 4.â An evening
â¢ paper prints the following: The tragical
; story of the life of Sarah Althea Hill was
j resurrected in the State Attorney's office
I this morning. Those people of a super-
I stitious turn of mind, who believe in the
I existence of an evil eye, will find food for
i thought and argument in the case of M.
F. Cohen, self-confessed thief, fugitive
from justice and nephew of the notorious
woman whose career brought infamy to
' the name of some of the best-known peo
] pie in California.
The twenty-seven years of Cohen's life
have been almost as eventful as those of
his aunt. Surrounded by every luxury of
an ideal Southern home, with an unlim
ited bank account and every inducement
to make his mark in the world, the "evil
eye" of Sarah Althea Hill pursued him,
compelling him to fall lower and lower,
until to-day he finds himself a prisoner
in the Cook County Jail, unable to furnish
bonds, and a loug penitentiary sentence
confronting him.
This is the story of a high roller, whose
escapades and their results will be read
with interest in the principal cities of the
West. The parents of Cohen live in Hous
ton, Texas, and are wealthy. Several
years iigo he was intrusted with money
belonging to his enir>ioye r and left precip
itately. He was arrested and taken to
his home, where his father's standing
saved him. He was released on bail and
jumped his bonds, going to the Indian
Territory, where he had a similar experi
ence. Criminal deeds were repeated at
Galveston and other Southwestern cities
where he is still wanted on forfeited bail
bonds. In the course of his travels he came
to Chicago.
George W. Riggs of the New York Life
Insurance Company was attracted by the
young man and, investigating his record,
befriended him, giving him employment.
Cohen secured a place for himself and his
wife with Mrs. Fox, Thirty-first street and
Michigan avenue. He left without paying
nis bill. Mrs. Johnson of Seventy-sixth
street, Grand Crossing, was served in a
similar manner. Complaints be^an to
pour into the office o| Mr. Riggs and he
investigated ilie young man's accounts.
Shortage to the amount of $400 was dis
covered and Cohen's arrest and indict
ment followed. The latter was voted yes
terday. Cohen was arrested on the capias
this morning and lodged in the county
jail.
Mr. Biggs in the meantime investigated
Cohen's record and secured an unusual
history of a life of crime. Cohen was a
high liver and since his father disowned
him has been gambling, drinking and
playing the races at the expense of numer
ous employers. As a direct result of the
knowledge thus secured, Mr. Riggs made
a request at the Assistant State Attor
ney's office this morning that any security
offered for him be gilt-edged as he feared
the fellow would escape punishment by
his usual method of poor bonds. Mr.
Riggs was assured thai unusual rare
would be exercised in the case.
TOOK POISON O N A. CAR.
Florence Allen Telis Conductor Huffy
He Would Be lUd of Her.
CHICAGO, 111., Djc. 4.â Florence Al
len took a swallow of carbolic acid In a
State-street car last night and told Con
ductor James Duffy that he would now be
rid of her. She was taken to a hospital
near by and will probably recover.
Miss Alien is a stenographer in the
freight office of the Rock Island Railroad
and lives with her mother at 943 La Salle
street. It is not known where she boarded
Conductor Duffy's car, but at Sixty-first
street she wa? sitting in one corner talking
to him earnestly.
A moment later several women in the
car saw her ri-e up, drain a small bottle
at her lips and throw it at Daffy. Duffy
ran from thÂ« car and called Policeman
Paton of theEnglewood station, who had
just left the car. To the policeman carry
in}: her from the car the young woman
said that Duffy had told her to take the
poison. The conductor did not wait to see
whether it was life or death, because be
was due at the barns in five minutes. He
tools his car in, changed his clothes and
left. He lives at ti2l State street.
Two notes pinned 10 the lining of Miss
Allen's jacket indicate that Duffy has
wronged uer. One of them said he had
told her to kill herself. and he would stand
the expense. The other, to Duffy, de
clared that she still loved the man.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CAT^L., SATURDAY, DECEMBER 5, 1896.
GERMANY'S GREAT
SCANDAL GROWS
Interesting Revelations in
the Trial of the
Editors.
Big Sensation Caused by the
Confession of Baron yon
Luetzow.
Says the Commissioner of the Detec
tive Police Conspired Against
High Officials.
BERLIN, Germany, Dec 4.â At the trial
to-day of the five editors, Baron yon
Luetzow, Herren Foellmar, Ploett,
Leckert and Berger, on charges of libeling
Count yon Eulenburg, Baron Marscball
yon Bieberstein and Prince Alexander yon
Hohenlohe, the public prosecutor stated
that he had instituted criminal proceed
ings against Baron yon Luetzow upon the
charges of forgery and fraud. The charges
of forgery grew out of the testimony given
by Herr Kukutzch, a member of the press
bureau, yesterday, in which the witness
accused Luetzow of forging a receipt for a
sum of 50 marks, which he alleged he had'
paid Kukutzch for writing certain articles,
and a charge of fraud was also involved in
the matter of incriminating papers, which
Luetzow falsely declared were written by
Kukutzch,
Baron yon Lutzow, through his advo
cate, has made what purports to be a full
confession. He declares that Larkelow,
one of the defendants, supplied the mate
rial for the article against Count Botho
yon Eulenburg Trekert, alleging that
Marschall yon Bieberstein, Prime Minister
of Foreign Affairs, inspired the article.
When yon Lutzow told Major yon Tausch,
commissioner of the detective police, that
the Foreign Minister had inspired the ar
ticle, Major Tau'.ch was delighted because
of the personal animosity he entertaine d
for Baron Marschall yon Bieberstein. He
said he intended to communicate the
whole story to Count Philip yon Eulen
burg, the German Embassador to Austria,
with a view of convincing him that the
Foreign Minister was conspiring with
members of Emperor William's circle.
His object was to induce Count Philip to
tell Emperor William about the alleged
conspiracy and so ruin Baron Marschall
yon Bieberstein. Major Tausch notified
Count Philip that important information
was awaiting him. Count Philip replied
that he would soon be in Berlin, when he
would confer with him.
Later, when the Foreign Office moved
energetically concerning the articles,
Major Tausch was compelled to arrest
Luetzow, but promised to shield Him. It
was Major Tausch who induced Luetzow to
procure the forged document mentioned
in yesterday's proceeding purporting to be
a receipt for 50 marks given by Herr
Kukutsch, belonging to the press bureau
of the Foreign Office, when he was falsely
accused of having furnished certain arti
cles that had been published. Lutzow de
clares that he did not write this receipt I
himself.
The confession then deals with the alle
gations that Major Tausch intrigued
against Baron yon Lieter, ex-Minister of
the Interior, involving charges against
Herren Hammann and Eckert, besides
Herr Kukutsch. Luetzow declares that he
was compelled to obey Major Tausch, as
he was depending upon him for a liveli
hood, receiving from him 200 marks a
month. Major Tausch threatened to stop
the payment of this money if he refused
to oblige him.
The reading of the confession caused a
great sensation in the courtroom.
Major Tausch, who testified yesterday,
was recalled to the witness-stand. He ad
mitted some of the statements in the con
fession and entered into a long explana
tion of the others. Some of them he de
nied, including the one relative to the
forgery of tne receipt.
During the giving of this testimony the
Judge warned Major Tausch to remember
that he was on Ms oath lest he incur a
sentence of penal servitude.
Baron Marschall yon Bieberstein was re
called upon the conclusion of the examin
ation of Major Tausch. He exDlained the
reasons why the Foreign Office ceased four
years ago to employ the police, and added :
"The police may employ what agents they
please, but when they have the effrontery
to slander me and the Foreign Offico offi
cials I must have recourse to publicity to
brand such doings."
This declaration caused another sensa
tion.
The court adjourned after the evidence
of the Foreign Minister had been given.
Interest in the case has been greatly in
creased by to-day's revelations, and it is
thoucht that persons in high circles will
be shown to have been concerned in the
intrigues against state officials. The
greatest interest is now centered in what
Count PMlip yon Eulenburg will have to
say on the subject.
COUNTERFAITING SILVER CULNS.
An Inducement to Make Money at Good
as Uncle Sam's.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 3.â The re
port of R. E. Preston, the Director of the
Mint, shows in elaborate details the
operations of the mints and assay offices
during the fiscal year 1896, together with
statistics of foreign countries relative to
the production, coinage and monetary
conditions of each.
The total coinage of gold and silver by
the various countries of the world was as
follows: Gold, $231,087,438; silver, $121
-610,219. Total, $352,697,657. The total
metallic stock and uncovered pacer in the
world was estimated on January 1, 1896
to be $10,938,600,000. The Director recom
mends that authority be given the Secre
tary of the Treasury to have experiments
made to determine the best means of pre
venting the counterfeiting of silver coin
age.
At the prevailing price of silver, the
difference between the bullion and the
nominal value of our silver coins is about
100 per cent, and this constitutes a great
temptation for the stamping ol such coins
by unscrupulous persons, affording them
an opportunity to place in circulation
counterfeit silver coins at about 100 per
cent profit as good as those stamped by
the mints and which cannot bf> distin
guished from them, even by experts.

HUNDREDS POISONED BY BREAD.
A/I the Trouble Traced to One Bakery,
but the Cause of the Poisoning
Is a Mystery.
MILWAUKEE. Wis , Dec. 4.â The
Health Department repoits the wholesale
poisoning of people in the northern part
of the city. Members of 100 families are
ill with all the symptons of arsenic poi
soning. The people have been eating
bread purchased at a bakery establish
ment on Sherman street. The physicians
are inclined to attribute the origin of the
wholesale poisoning to that source.
Many of the sick people are in a very
dangerous condition. Everybody in the
neighborhood is greatly excited and the
utmost indignation is felt against the pro
prietor of the bakery. It is not believed
that the poison was put in the bread in
tentionally, but the people feel that suf
ficient care was not taken in keeping dan
gerous ingredients out of it. The bakery
is quite an extensive one and hitherto has
had the reputation of being a very good
one. The employes connected with it
cannot explain the bad effects caused by
the bread.
They assert that every Drecaution has
been taken to make the bread pure and
wholesome. Some of their families have
eaten of the bread, but found no bad
effects from it. They assert that there was
no reason for putting arsenic ia it for the
purpose of improving the quality of it.
The proprietor of the suspected estab
lishment denies that his bread is tbe cause
of the trouble, ana has demanded an in
vestigation, wbich the health authorities
have promised him. Specimens of the
bread have been sent for examination to
competent chemists, and until the result
of the examination has been made known
it will be impossible to state with certainty
that tbe bread was tbe cause of the whole
sale illness.
The proprietor, while denying that his
bread is responsible, says that If it be so
it must have been due to the flour used by
him, as it could not have occurred in the
baking. There is, however, another theory
that the deed was done by a discharged
workman in order to be revenged.
FROST BILTEN AT SEA.
Terrible Suffering of Two Men Lost in a
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 4.-The North
German Lloyd steamer Dresden, which ar
rived from Bremen laÂ»t night, picked up
two fishermen in a dory yesterday after
noon. The men were named Patrick
Foley and Joe Higgins. They belonged
aboard a fishing schooner of Gloucester,
Mass.
On Saturday they lost sight of the
schooner during a dense fog" on the La
Havre banks and were unable to find her
again. There was no water in the boat
and no provisions, and the two men suf
fered terribly from hunger and thirst. On
Monday it snowed and they eat enough
snow to appease their thirst, but they had
no food until they were taken aboard the
Dresden.
Their hands were frost bitten, but the
surgeon of the Dresden says they will re
cover the use of them in a few days. When
picked up tnere was only one broken oar
in the dory. The others had been swept
away.
BAD CABLES IN BRAZIL.
It Will Be Impossible to Worh the Line
Up the Amazon.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 4.â Consul
Matthews writes the Department of State
from Para that the Brazilian Government
is having a hard time in trying to operate
a cable to Manaos. The cable, costing
about $1,000,000, was guaranteed by the
company for thirty days.
On the thirty-first day it failed and no
message bas been sent over it since last
February. It is hoped to have it in work
ine order by the end of the year. Engineers
now assert that a caDle cannot be made a
success on account of the current and
many obstructions in the river-bed.
The X Ray in Evidence.
DENVER, Colo., Dec. 4.â The Colorado
courts have allowed the X ray to be intro
duced as expert testimony for the first
time since the marvelous discovery of its
penetrative power. After three days' ar
gument by some of the most eminent
legal talent of the State, Judge Lefevre
yesterday granted the application in the
case of James Smith vs. Dr. W. W. Grant.
The plaintiff asks for $20,000 damages for
a false diagnosis, whereby he was treated
for a contusion instead of a fracture, on
account of wbich he lost the use of on*
leg. The X ray showed in court that
there was a clearly defined fracture and
there would have been no suffering or de
lay in procuring proper treatment, as it
was a simple fracture.

CHALLENGE TO BILLIARDISTS.
Ivtia and Italy Hilling to Match Anu
'Other Two Players.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 4.-Frank Ives
and Maurice Daly have issued a challenge
to any other two billiard-players m the
world to play a series of match games,
balk line, cushion carroms, and the cham
pion's game, for a stake from $500 to $2000
a side, the contests to take place in the
five cities offering the best inducements,
the games in each city to be not less than
600 points at balk line, 300 points at cush
ion carroms and 500 points at the cham
pion's game, to be played under the rules
governing the recent tournament managed
by Daly.
The players making the greatest num
ber of points in the several styles of game
are to receive the entire stakes and the net
receipts. If there is no reply to the chal
lenge within a reasonable time, other in
ducements will probably be offered by Mr.
Daly to bring together the best American
and foreign players.

Decision of a District Court That
Oscar Cespedes Must Be Tried
by Court-Martia .
HAVANA, Cuba. Dec. 4â The people of
Havana are still in the dark so far as the
movements of General VVeyler are con
cerned. If the authorities have heard
anything definite from him since he went
into camp near Los Palmicos they are
keeping their information to themselves.
They state that they are ignorant of his
present position, but that they know he is
carrying out in detail the plan of the cam
paign prepared before he left Havana.
Rumors regarding Maceo are many, but
little attention is paid to them.
The only definite news from the province
of Pinar del Rio is that the commands of
Generals Melquizo and Incian have had
encounters with the rebels. The fight in
the Gobernado Hills yesterJay was be
tween General Inclan's command and a
band of rebels. No details of the engage
ment have been made public and it is not
known which side was victorious.
A party of rebels who made an attack
at Fort Razen, province of Santiago de
Cuba, were repulsed. They were pursued
by the local guerrillas, who killed six in
surgents and wounded fourteen. The
troops had one officer and four privates
wounded.
Colonel Toro reports that his command
had defeated the rebels under Costillo and
other leaders at Mazaraco, province of
Havana. The rebels lost twenty-three
killed, while the Spanish loss was six
killed and eleven wounded.
The District Court of Matanzas has
given a decision in the case of Oscar Ces
pedes, an American citizen who was cap
tured in the field and held as a prisoner
of war in San Severino Castle, Matanzas.
The court holds that he must be handed
over to a military tribunal for trial.
NEW YORK, N. V.. Dec. 4.â A Times
special from Tampa says: Passengers who
arrived from Havana last evening report
that a fight has taken place between the
vanguard of Weyler's army and some of
Maceo' s men, a large force on each side
being engaged. The Spanish army did
not come off with flying colors. It is re
ported in Havana that Weyler has lost
two railroad trains from dynamite explo
sions, losing much-needed army supplies
for his men that had been sent from
Havana.
Fifty persons arrested the past week
were deported yesterday, their future resi

VERY COSTLY INFATUATION.
Peculiar Story Revealed by an Application
to Incarcerate a Rich French Woman
in an Asylum.
PARIS, France, Dec. 4.â Legal proceed
ings in lunacy against a wealthy young
woman named Marie Saudret have made
official record of an extraordinary story
that off and on has been the gossip of the
boulevards for three years. Away back
in '93 she became infatuated with a
Hungarian musician named Ferko,
who was the leader of an orchestra in one
of the swell caies on the rue d'Elysee.
Ferko was married.
Marie cave his wife $5000 on condition
that she would return with her two chil
dren to her home and remain there for the
rest of her life. The young girl's family
made futile efforts to break off the liaison,
and it continued until a couple of weeks
ago when Ferko died and was buried by
his mistress with great pomp and cere
mony.
After the departure of his wife he gave
up his position and became a habitue of
the races, clubs and gambling dens, and
according to the papers filed in court he
squandered in dissipation in this period
not less than $250,000 of his inamorata's
lortune.
Since his death she herself has plunged
madly into dissipation, and it is now pro
posed to incarcerate her and appoint a
conservator for the estate, which, notwith
standing the drain upon it, exceeds in
value $1,000,000.

Railroad Bridges Are Carried Away
by Torrents and Traffic Is at
a Standstill.
TACOMA, Wash., Dec. 4.â The Chi
nook winds of the last f-w days melted
the snow on the mountains and the heavy
rains which have fallen resulted to-day in
all rivers in this vicinity rsing higher
than even during the floods o three weeks
ago. More damace was done ihis locality
to-day than during the entire other period.
Early this afternoon the Northern Fa
cinc bridge over White River was washed
away by the current, hurling a huge pile
of driftwood against it. Although anew
bridge was on hand and the piers laid, it
was impossible to restore railroad traffic
from Tacoma to Seattle until the latter
part of next week.
The village of Auburn is flooded, water
standing a foot deep on the main street.
The current formed many channels, and
beside filling all the cellars, rushed be
tween buildings, carrying off shanties and
.Lighter articles. The Steeck River also
left its bed, and submerging the lowlands
and meadows of all farms in the valley.
J. C. Dieringer's farm at Dieringer. four
miles north of Puyallup, is completely
covered by water, which in the pastures
- and" meadows is ud nearly to the top of
the-fences. The floor of Dierlng-r's im
.mense stock barn was over a foot under
â¢water at 4 o'clcck.
The current of Puyallup Kiver is so strong
that it washed away the entire south
.approach of the Meriden-street bridge at
â Puyallup, and is eating out a new channel
through the hop fields. At the present
..rate at which it is changing its course Dy
morning the bridge will hang over dry.
, All afternoon farmers have been rushing
to town for aid. From all over the valiey
come reports of inestimable damage to
crops and lences. No lives are reported
lost as yet.
Here at Tacoma the Indian reservation
.gardens and orchards are covered by
water two feet deep.
â¢ Passengers on the overland train, which
arrived three and a half hours late this
evening, say that Green River, this side
'o i the Cascades, was never so high as
now. A man who has just arrived says
White River is two feet higher than the
highest last flood and still rising.
The streets of Kent, he says, are flooded,
and the river pounding down the valley,
sweeping havoc before it. Ranches this
side of Seattle bounded by the White,
Black and Cedar rivers are again flooded,
but it is impossible to get any details irom
there. Through trains are running nearly
â on time and no damage has yet occurred
to telegraph lines.

SONOMA FARMERS MEET.
Assemblyman Price Creates a Breeze by
Attacking the State Bureau of
Highways.
SANTA ROSA, Cal.. Dec. 4.â The So
noma County Farmers' Institute opened
its session in Ridgway Hall to-day. The
high order of the proeramme and the
deep interest taten by the farmers
throughout the county in the sugar-beet
. Question make the attendance quite large.
â Professor A. P. Hayne was the first
speaker, he having taKen the place of
Professor Hilgard, who Â«as unavoidably
absent. Professor Hayne first took occa
sion to explain the relation, of the Uni
versity of California to the farmer, and
s:ated tiat the names of 6000 farmers were
on the mailing list. He then delivered a
timely and interesting lecture on "Resist
ant Vines."
The speaker favored the rupesteris and
riparia, and explained their different
characteristics. The former vine, he said,
would do weil on a rocky, gravelly hill
side, as it did not require much moisture,
but he advised planting ihs riparia only
in a deep, moist soil. The lecturer was
asked a number of questions, ail of which
were answered to the satisfaction of the
qaerist. and the audience learned many
new facts on viticulture. Professor Hayne
used charts in snowing the proper meth
ods of pruning and grafting vin^ s, which
materially aided his heurers to a proper
understaiidiii â  of the theme.
At tl.e afternoon session the first busi
ness was to effect a permanent organiza
tion, alter which Edward F. Adams of
Wrights explained the object and aims oi
the institute. William P. Gotward of
Santa Rosa read a paper by Luther Bur
bank, the well-known floral and fruit ex
perimenter, on "Nut-growing in Sonoma
County." The writer declared that this
county was one of the best adapted to nut
growing he had visited, and he strongly
urged the farmers to plant nut-bearing
trees.
* Marsden Marion of the State Bureau of
Highways was called upon and gave an
â  interesting explanation ot the work of the
bureau. When the time came for a dis
cussion ol Commissioner lUaason's talk a
little r>r. eze arose when Assemblyman
W. P. Price criticized the bureau, 3aying
that he bad voted against its creation two
years ago and would do so again. He <dv
â  not believe in the scheme. But there
were defenders of the highway bureau
among the audience, and short, forcible
speeches were made by F. Butler, Colonel
McDonald, E. D. Sweetser, E. F. Adams
and G. N. Sanborn.
A talk on the "General Farmer and How
to Make His Business Profitable" by Ed
ward P. Adams followed. The institute
adjourned to meet to-nicht, when a mu
sical and literary programme was ren
dered. The greatest interest centers in
to-morrow's session, when it is expected
that Claus fcfpreckeis will be present and
talk on the culture of the sugar beet.
NO DEMAND FOR HORSES.
Thousands of Animcls Running Wild on
the Bunch-Grass Hills of Eastern
Washington.
TACOMA, Wash., Dec. 4.â Horses have
become a "drug on the marKet" in this
State. While electricity and bicycles have
been increasing in popular favor for sev
eral years past great bands of horses have
been roaming over the bunch-grass hills
of Eastern Washington. Rapidly increas
ing in number their value has diminished
in like proportion.-until many owners do
not now consider It worth while to feed
them through the winter.
A few d;i\s ago an Eastern Washington
stockman arrived here with two carloads
of horses, which he hoped to market on
Puget Sound. He found the market
glutted both here and in Seattle ana final
ly sold his horsea to get money to pay the
freight bill. They brought $3 to $15 each,
the receipts just about covering the ex
pense of bringing them across the moun
tains.
Stockmen say there are about 100,000
horses in Eastern Washington ranees
and they are destroying feed that would
support three times that number of
cattle and sheep. The latter animals are
being housed and fed during the stormy
weather, while the horses are left on the
ranges to starve unless they can paw
through the snow to the surlace. Cattle
men desire that the larger portion of the
horses perish during the winter, that the
bunch grass raftges may be preserved for
sheep and beef cattle. They say that in
that event the horses left will be worth as
much as the unnumbered thousands now
roaming at large.
For Beveral years past many owners
have not taken the trouble to even round
up and brand their horses, and in most
instances no taxes are paid on them.
Efforts have been made to find an Eastern
market, but without result, except that a
dozen or so carloads have been shipped to
France to supply the limited demand
there lor horsemeat.
REINDEER FOR ALASKA.
Explorer Bruce Purchases a Swift Schooner
for Use in Fulfilling His
Contract.
SEATTLE, Wash., Dec. 4.â ln further
ance of his contract with the Federal
Government to supply the Alaskan station
with Siberian reindeer, Miner W. Bruce,
the famous Alaskan explorer, has pur
chased at Gloucester, Mass., the fast
schooner Louis J. Kenny, lie is to bring
the vessel around Cape Horn, and her
master upon this voyage will be Captain
Saddler. At Gloucester and New York
she will take on a cargo of hardware for
the Seattle Hardware Company of this
city. It is expected that she will arrive at
this port by April 1, and about May 1
Bruce and Captain Saddler wiil take her
north on an Arctic reindeer voyage. She
is expected to do work similar to that for
which the schooners Ella Johnson and
Jessie were chartered last year. Owing to
great ice gorges, however, the Ella John
son accomplished but little.
News of the purchase of the Kenny
reached Seattle yestardaj' by private tele
gram. The sale was consummated mainly
through the efforts of B. H. Colby ot this
city. She is reported to be an unusually
speed y crait and was built at Es?ex, Mass.,
in 1889, since wnich time she has oeen en
gaged in nshing out of Gloucester. The
crew will be shipped from the Atlantic
side. Captain Saddler, who has brought
more than a score of vessels around the
horn, once commanded the Moonlight
when that vessel was engaged in cod fish
ing on the North Pacific.
Bruce will return to Seattle overland in
time to join the Kenny on her voyage to
the Arctic, he is reported as being en
gaged in making extensive preparations
for the trip which he is doubly anxious
should be successful owin? to last year's
failure in tne matter of reindeer transpor
tation.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 5, 1896
REDW OOD CITY'S
FOUNDER DEAD
Captain Bell Passes Away
at His San Diego
Home.
Prominent in San Francisco
During the City's Early
Growth.
Was a Member of the Original Vigi
lance Committee in the
Fifties.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Dec. 4.â A prom
inent figure in the" early history of the
State passed away' to-day in the person of
Captain William Bell of this city. He wa3
75 years of age, and was born in Beaver
County, Pa., on May 21, 1821. In 1852 he
argonauted to San Francisco and became
a ship-builder. His yard was at the cor
ner of Market and First streets, in what is
now the heart of the metropolis. There
Captain Bell built some of Â£he most noted
vessels of the coast in early days, among
others the State of Sonora, which plied in
the Gulf of California for years.
Bell's shipyard was a sight of San Fran
cisco in the fifties, and many exciting
events occurred there. One or two hang
inss took place, and attempts were made
to burn the yard in revenge for the prom
inent part ta"ken by Captain Bell in rid
ding the city of hard characters. Captain
Bell was a member of the original vigi
lance committee and helped to hang
Corri and his gang. He was a man of
great courage and uprightness.
During the twenty-five years of his resi
dence in San Francisco Captain Bell ac
quired a large fortune, owning a number'
of vessels in the coasting trade and ex
tending his business in all directions.
One of his vessels carried the first brick
for the prison at San Quentin.
Captain Bell was the founder of Red
wood City, San Mateo County, construct
ing the first building there. His son,
Robert J. Bell, was the first white child
born at Redwood City.
It was in later years that ieverses over
took Captain Bell, leaving him at the time
of bis death a comparatively poor man.
He is believed to have lost considerable
money in building the marine ways at
Eureka, the first in the State outside ot
San Francisco, and his marine ways on
North Island in San Diego Bay lulled to
recoup him for his losses.
The wife of Captain Bell died twelve
yeais ago and, in 1888, he removed to this
city, where he spent the remaining years
of his life in the management of marine
ways. His son lives in this city and the
only other child, Mrs. J. M. Wood, is a
resident of Oakland.
The last illness of Captain Bell was less
than a week in duration, and in spite of
his advanced age he seemed to be in fairly
good health until the sudden ailment that
carried him off. The funeral services will
be held Sunday afternoon, with the burial
at Mount Hope, San Diego.

had visited most of the civilized and semi
civilized countries of the world. He then
served the Union in the Mexican War, en
gaging in naval service. Later he entered
Annapolis Academy, but the gold excite
ment drew him again to California in
1849. In 1861 he went East and entered
the naval service in the war.
Alter the war Douglass came to Cali
fornia and remained. He was elected
Surveyor of Stanislaus County in 1869 and
servad almost continuously since. He
owned a farm near here. Douglass
served as auctioneer at the time ot tie
laying out of the city of Merced, and sold
the first lots from a flatcar at that place.
He was one of the most jovial and
honeit and best-liked men in this valley.
He was a member of the Society of Cali
fornia Pioneers. The deceased was the
uncle of Sheriff Douglass, who was killed
near Nevada City some months ago by an
outlaw wnom he had mortally wounded.
The burial takes place a l Stockton to

Washington* Congressmen- Elect Will
JS'ot Jilock Legislation.
TACOMA, Wash., Dec. 4.âWashing
ton's Congressmen who were elected on
the silver fusion ticket, in response to in
quiries from a 'local lumber man, give
their views on the tariff. W. C. Jones
says :
"I always advocated fair protection to
all American industries, and applying the
principle locally, I shall deem it a duty
to employ every reasonable effort to secure
adequate protection to all products of this
Slate, the prices of which are injuriously
affected by foreign competition. I shall,
however, favor the proviso that whenever
the producers of any protected commodity
unite in any pool, trust, syndicate or
other unlawful combination for the pur
pose of artificially limiting production
or augmenting the price to the consumer,
such commodity shall become entitled to
admission without payment of duty, and
the importer may employ any appropriate
legal remedy to enforce such proviso."
James Hamilton Lewis replies: "1 am a
tariff Democrat and being for a tariff favor
a special duiy on lumber."

STOCKTON'S SENSATION.
Manager Corcoran of the California Navi-
gation Company Sued for a
Divorce.
STOCKTON, Cal., Dec. 4.â Somewhat
of a sensation was created in official cir
cles to-day by the riline of a complaint for
divorce against Manager H. J. Corcoran
of the California Navigation and Improve
ment Company by his wife, Ella May Cor
coran. It is not known what the alleged
grounds 1. r separation are, but that there
is something sensational in the charges
seems probable, as the plaintiff B attorneys
took particular pains to tell the Deputy
County Clerk to be sure and keep the pa
pers under lock and key, although the law
compels the clerk-s to do that. Neither
would Attorney Gould speak of the case at
ail, and Mr. Corcoran, when questioned,
expressed surprise aud asked, "What
suit?' 1
Mr. Corcoran is one of the most promi
nent and energetic men in this city, and
as manager of the old line Bteamship
company holds much responsibility. He
is a member of the Commercial Associa
tion, and has been foremost in inducing
many of the enterprises which have made
Stockton a center of so much importance
in the past year. There is not known to
have been, any trouble between Mr. Cor
coran and his wife and family before this.
Some of his most intimate friends said,
however, alter the suit was commenced
that he was an avowed disciple of the
theory of free love in regard to the social
make-up, but the circumstances do not
seem to warrant such an imputation.
Tucson Election Contest Decided.
TUCSON. Aeiz., Dec. 4.â Judge Bethune
to-day, in the contested election case be
tween Bullock (D.) and Bueiiman (R.) for
the office of Supervisor of Pima County,
gave judgement for Bullock on a recount
of ballots.
The court held that there were sixty
votes illegally rejected by the election
board of Tucson Precinct. This makes
the board Democratic. Buehman was the
only Republican who received a certificate
of election in Pima County, and the de
cision against him to-day makes the en
tire ticket elected Democratic, something
which has never before occurred in the
history of the county.
Double JUurder at Juneau.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., Dec. 4.â
The steamship Topeka, five days overdue

der occurring recently at Juneau, where a
drunken Indian beat and stabbed to death
his squaw and her sister. All three were

Conservatory of Chicago, in the Isabella
building, was frightfully crushed by a
turntable of the Chicago and Eastern
Illinois Railway Company yesterday. Ho
died an hour later in the County Hospital.
The friends of the old man say his death
has an ugly look. How he came to be in
tho pit under the turntable is a mystery
to them, and ttiey can only believe that
be is a victim of foul rlay. An investiga
tion will he be2Un to ascertain who is
responsible for hi* death. Professor
Moore was 40 years old.

Governor Budd Stays the

Until June.
Will Appoint a Commission to
Pass Upon His Mental
Soundness.
All Testimony Fav?rabla to the Con

SACRAMENTO, Cal.. Dec. 4.âTo-mor
row morning Governor Budd will sign a
reprieve which will pive to Salter D. Wor
den. the convicted Yolo train-wrecker, a
new lease on life until the 4th of next
June. The Governor's reasons for this
act are many. During the past month he
has been assailed by a flood of petitions
from all portions of the United States,
many of them setting forth that Woraen
was mentally irresponsible, and had so
been for years. Some of these petitions
are signed by influential citizens of East
ern States, men whose names bear weight
and who cou'd not be persuaded to attach
their names to a document of this nature
unle as they were assured beyond doubt
that within the frontispiece of Salter D.
Worden the wheels were working cross
wise.
Even Grover Cleveland, President of
the United States, has pleaded for the life
of the man who stands convicted of hay -
ing removed a rail and wrecked a train
during the great railroad strike, hurling
into eternity four men who were in the
employ of the United States Government
as protectors ol its frontiers.
Governor Budd is just now very busy,
and he fands it impossible to set aside the
time to make a thorough investigation
into the rights and wrongs of the Worden
case. Until he can do so Worden will
languish a close prisoner within the gran
ite wall of the Foisom penitentiary.
Evidence favorable to Worden will re
ceive at the hands of the Governor a full
and searching investigation, and if the
commission which he will appoint de
cides that Worden is mentally irrespon
sible a commutation wiil be issued reduc
ing the death sentence to life imprison
ment. On the other hand, if it be proved
that Worden is in full possession of his
mental faculties, he will die on the gal
lows.

:..."."â¢â¢' . Producer.
Exciting Controversy Harks the Clos
ing Hours of tbe Sacramento
Convention.
â¢SACRAMENTO. Cal., Dec 4.â The
fourth and last day's session of the twen
tieth Fruit-f rowers' Convention opened
this morning with a few remarks from
President Ellwood Cooper, replying to the
resolution adopted a day or two ago in
dQrsing him for a McKinley Cabinet posi
. tion jas Secretary of Agriculture. He said
.he would be glad to have the position dur
ing one administration, and believed he
had the physical power and mental ability
to do the work faithfully and well.
"A first-class warship costs about $2,500,
-"000. One-hundredth part of that sum
properly spent would find a remedy for
fruit pests which destroy annually $300,
-> 000,000 worth of fruit," he said, "and then
r many more warships could be built."
The report of tbe committee on co
operation was taken up. This was fol
lowed by the sensation of the day. and.
In fact, of the entire session. R. D.
Stephens charged that the "Fruit-growers'
and -Shippers' Association have so manipu
. la'ted things as to crush out independent
. .shippers and glut New York and Boston
markets."
jMr. Block said it was the first time in
fifty, years of business life that he had
â  . been.- charged with being bribed. He is
one of the association's directors.
Mr. Stephens said he made no such
charge, and tbat possibly Mr. Block had
been imposed upon.
Mr. BlocK, in continuing his remarks,
: saidhe.did not believe Chairman Wein
arock was guilty of any such manipuia
. tion, and he did not believe that the or
ganization could be used for any such
-purpose. He said he did not believe there
h.ad been anything wrong, but it wag pos
. gibje that some mistakes might have been
â¢ .Vice- President D. T. Fowler stood by
'â .the Shippers' and Growers' Association.
â¢-â¢â  He â said he thought Mr. Stephens' re
.rnarfcs proved the weakness of his own
position. He said tne association had
.he en dealing with agencies over which it
hid pb control. On the contrary, it had
.. been -â¢tjying to cultivate the New York
. 'arid' : Boston markets. The association
â  .waj formed of members within the Fruit
;ejpwers I Association, and he felt they
â  .-'.were" .'high-minded, honorable men, and
â nad trot manipulated things to crush out
..- ";the. independent shipper. He was not in
sympathy with a wholesale charge made
â¢â¢ en.fcne floor and not substantiated. There
: were" difficulties beyond control, and
: â  these were on the other side of the conti
nent..
. Spl Runyon of Sacramento supported
â¢;Mr.- Stephens. He said he believed that
some things Stephens said he could prove
to : .6e facts. Mr. Stephens had put it loud
'.'â  enougb. but not strong enough. Mr.
'â¢"Hun von said he was an independent ship
per. 'He did not mean to make any per
. sona} charge against Mr. Weinstock. He
' "did not think tdat Mr. Stephens deserved
'the brunt of criticism and he did not think
- there was a set of men in the State who
could-reniain in session four days and do |
'as little for themselves as the fruit-grow
erral . [Applause and laughter.] â -
â  J. P. Anstatt of Yuba City said tbat if
the iruft-growers would turn the business
over to tLeir wives they might do better.
[Lfiugbter.]
Mr. Stephens said he did not want it to
go lortli that he had attacked* Colonel
Weinstock's honor. He regarded Colonel
Weirwtock as a gentleman and a friend.
He-(Stephens) had been charged by Mr.
Fowler with muddyiug the stream when
he* was not guilty. He did not mean to
aitack the honor of any member of the
â¢ 'association. He reiterated that the New
York and Boston markets were glutted
for tne purpose of destroying the inde
pendent shipper. If not so. why were
carsof fruit held back at Chicago, through
the medium of a certain intermediary,
which' he knew to be the case, to the detri
â¢ ment of the independent grower and
-shipper who was trying to save his home?
Fpuit-growers could make a much larger
profit if they would but act together.
Others spoke, saying it was wrong to
charge tbe directors with misdealing.
'Colonel Weinatock appeared in the hall
at 12:05 o'clock, and his appearance was
. .appfaudei. He bad been telephoned to
come". The convention adjourned to 1
o'clock.
1 â¢ '.The first thing at the afternoon session
Sjas the reply of Colonel H. Weinstork to
â  '.tb.* charges of Mr. Stephens. He said he
" found himself in a sort of defensive posi
tion, but he did not know why.
"Mr. Stephens seems to find fault tbat I
did not send in a more comprehensive re
port-of the Growers' and Shippers' Asso
ciation land that I have not been in more
regular attendance here," be said.
He did not know why men who are not
members of the associations themselves
should be made acquainted with tbe busi
ness of that association. Mr. Stephens
had not read to the convention all the re
port-he had sent in. Colonel Weinstock
then read his report to the State board
from the printed report of the board and
said he did not know of anything he could
add to it on the matters brought up. Re
plying to tbe charge that the New York
and Boston markets had been glutted by
the Growers' and Shippers' Association be
said that Mr. Stephens' position was in
comprehensible to him. This year Omaha,
St. Louis and other Western cities were
very' poor markets, but last year they
were good. Tbe result was that the ship
per had to send his fruit to the far East
ern market. If tbere were any glutting,
the fault wps as much with the independ
ent rhjpper as with tbe association.
.'I am satisfied that if Mr. Stephens
could he would wipe t is association out,
focthe reason that it gives growers and
shippers light and order, where he wants
â¢ darbnesb anu chaos," he said.
He # did not believe the fruit-growers
wanted the association wiped out. He
thought he had been put in a defensive
position without cause. He challenged
Mr. Stephens to speak out if be knew any
thing of personal discredit to him, or for
ever after hold his peace.
N. W. Motheial asked Colonel Wein-
Htocfcif something could not be done to
seduce freight charges. Colonel Wein
stock explained tbat the railroad said the
rates could not be reduced, for the reason
that California had the lowest continental
rates of any fruit section in this country.
Members at last year's convention
promised to send in specific grievances,
but none bad been sent in, and there ha i
since been nothing for the committee,
with n whose province the matter came,
toxiÂ«.
Numerous questions were asked Colonel
JTVeinstock by Messrs. Wilson, Frencis and
1 !iers, seeking to learn if be knew where
V -Sy shipped their fruit and that certain
'firms West and East knew when and to
what po'nis ihe Questioners shipped fruit.
Colonel Weinstock replied conclusively to
ail these questions, sta:ing that he di i
not know and had no means of learning
these things, and in several instances he
showed why it was not possible to learn.
A> to nolding cars three or four days in
Chicago, he said that if a car arrived at
Chicago and the conditions were unfavor
able for a sale it was held twelve, twenty
four or thirty-six hours for an opening
and possibly shipped off to Cincinnati,
Milwaukee. Cleveland or another point
north, south, east or we6t, and sold before
it was a physical possibility for the in
formation to be transmitted back to the
shipper here.
D. T. Fowler offered a substitute to tbe
report of tbe committee on co-operation to
the effect that the fruit-growers in each
section of the State proceed to form co
operative organizations."
Mr. Stephens got the floor and proceeded
to reply to Colonel Weinstock. Vice-Pres
ident William Johnston waa in the chair.
He rapped for order and told Mr. Steph
ens to speak to the question of the substi
tute. Mr. Stephens claimed he was speak
ing to the subject and proceeded to talK.
In about two minutes Vice-President
Johnston, who apparently did not want to
allow the "tall sycamore" of the Sacra
mento Valley to say what he wanted in
his energetic strain, whacked the gavel on
Lieutenant-Governor Jeter's desk with
much noise and commanded:
"Bilence! Talk to the question, sir."
"I am talking to the question, sir," said
Stephens.
"You are not," said the chair.
Then they proceeded to dispute, tit for
tal. iike this.:
"I am."
"You are not."
"I am."
"You are not; sit down or talk to the
question."
Mr. Stephens became stirred to tbe
depths. He shouted until the Senate
chamber reverberated with his tones:
"I refuse to be gagged and bulldozed by
the chairâ"
"I am not bulldozing," said Vice-Presi
dent Johnston, jumping to his feet, and
mixing more noise from tbe gavel with
Mr. Stephens' stentorian tones. The situ
atlon became exciting. The eye of the
fruit-grower flashed and several jumped
to tbeir feet exclaiming:
"Mr. Chairman!"
"I am talking in the interest of my
home and my children, and I refuse to be
bulldozed," shouted Mr. Stephens, waving
his arms for emphasis.
"What is the wish of the house?" ap
pealed the chair.
The vote taken was to the effect that
Mr. Stephens should confine himself
strictly to the question. The majority of
those present were not in sympathy with
his charges, and this had become evident
earlier in the day.
Mr. Stephens proceeded to have his say,
but with a lesser latitude. He was con
tinually interrupted by Messrs. Motneral,
Fowler, Block and others, Mr. Motheral
-finally moving the previous question in
order to shut him off. This was ruled out
of order, ana. Mr. Stephens talked a few
minutes longer, with more interruptions,
and finally sat down.
The substitute offered by Mr. Fowler
was adopted by a large majority. The
difference, in brief, between the report of
the committee on co-operation and the
substitute is that the former carries with
it matter criticizing the Growers' and
Shippers' Association
A resolution was adopted providine for
an exhibit of California fruits at the Ham
burg Horticultural Exhibition, wnich
opens next spring, and requesting the
Supervisors of each county in tne State to
make tbe collection of fruit. Resolutions
were also adopted requesting fruit-growers
and shippers of the Slate to ship first-class
fruit only; requesting the regents of the
State University to open the forestry
stations to students and botanists not
students of. the university; calling on
Congress to construct the Nicaragua
canal; asking the State Legislature to
pass a pure-food law and indorsing to the
Legislature tbe efforts of the Highway
Commissioners to mate good roads.
San Diego, Los Angeles, Sacramento,
Anderson, in Shasta County, and- San Jose
were nominated as places for holding tbe
next Fruit-growers' Convention. A mo
tion was made that two conventions be
held, one in the northern and one in the
southern part of tbe State; one in tbe
spring and one in the fall, and tbat the
whole matter be left with the State Board
of Horticulture. The motion prevailed,
with one fixing Shasta County as the place
for the northern convention.
A vote of thanks was returned to'tne
Chamber of Commerce and the citizens of
Sacramento and the State officers for tbe
agreeable manner in which they bad en
tertained the fruit-growers.
A huge bouquet of yellow chrysanthe
mums, tied with yellow and white rib
bons, emblematic of gold and silver, sud
denly appeared in tbe chamber. The pres
ident was appointed a committee of one to
present it to Governor B jdd, who was in
the executive office. The Governor could
not attend the convention this afternoon,
owing to the bearing of a case of commu
tation of sentence. He extended his best
wishes to the convention.
A vote of thanks was tendered to the
press lor its fair and impartial reports
of the convention. On motion of A.
Block of Banta Clara, a vote of thanks
was returned to the ladies who attended
and ornamented the convention. On mo
tion of Mr. Stephens, a vote of ibanks was
returned to President Cooper, Vice-Presi
deuts Johnston and Fowler and Secretary
Delong for the agreeable and efficient
manner in which they had performed
their duties. A special vote of thanks
was returned to Mr. Stephens and his
committee for ih lr efforts in making the
convention a success.
The fruit-growers were invited to attend
the Farmers' Institute at Santa Rosa next
Friday, and accepted.
At 4 o'clock the convention adjourned
sine die.
LOS ANGELES REFORMERS.
The Parkhurst Society Swears to a Score
of Warrants â Derelict Policemen
in Trouble.
LOS ANGELEB, Cal., Dec. 4.â A big
sensation was created here to-day when it
was learned that a score of warrants had
been issued for about a dozen saloon
keepers and an equal number of persons
who manage disorderly houses. These
warrants were being served this afternoon
as rapidly as tbe officers could locate the
individuals. They were issued on com
plaints sworn to by Rev. C. C. McLean,
the pastor of bimpson M. E. Cnurcb, who
is at tbe head of the law and order com
mittee of the Parkhurst Society of Minis
ters of this city.
This is the outcome of much persistent
effort on the part or the society to secure
tbe enforcement of municipal ordinances
by the police authorities. Some time ago
tbe society called on Chief of Police Glass
and wanted to know why he did not en
force the laws regulating the liquor traffic.
The Chief replied that he had no knowl
edge of such violations. Then, said the
Parkhurst society, we will inform you.
So they did.
The Parkhurst Society expects support
from the Police Commission. A promi
nent minister said tins forenoon that he
had assurances from several Commission
ers that they would revoke tbe license
of any saloon-keeper who violated the
law. provided the Parkhurst Society sup
plied conclusive evidence of guilt.
Another sensation was cansed late this
afternoon by the news that detectives of
the society had reported the names of
thirty-three policemen whom they saw
drinking in saloons wnile on duty.
LOS ANGELES MURDER CASE.
Strong Defense Advanced to Clear Dr.
Shorb of the Charge Preferred
Against Him.
'LOS ANGELES, Cal., Dec. 4.â The
prosecution in the case against Dr. An
drew Shorb, on trial for the murder of
Mrs. Jennie Snyder, late of Seattle, seems
to be gradually petering out.
The defense began taking testimony to
day. The first testimony introduced was
a deposition of John Snyder, tbe buÂ«band
of the deeeised, in which he said that
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 5, 1890.
while his wife was in the East she had
had two operations performed, one of
them being for the removal of a cancerous
growth. This was followed by depositions
of the physicians who treated her. They
went at great length into the details of
her physical condition.
It is the plan of the defense to show
that Dr. Shorb was in no wise responsible
for the condition that caused Mrs. Sny
der's death. This afternoon Dr. Royer ol
Seattle gave some startling testimony.
He stated that in June last Mrs. Jennie
Snyder and Rellans, with whom she lived
and who committed suicide after her
death, called at his office in Seattle. He
found evidence of injury to the woman,
evidently produced by inexperienced
hands. The defendant Â«aye his testimony
and described his treatment of Mrs.
Snyder, denying that he had ever per
formed any criminal operation.
DINGLEY BILL MAY PASS.
Congressman McLach/an Does Not Be-
lieve the Silver Senators Wiil
Block Legislation.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Dec. 4. â Con
gressman McLachlan will leave for Wash
ington to-morrow to attend the coming
session of Congress. A Call correspond
ent asked him to-day as to the nrobability
of accomplishing anything in the way of
general legislation daring the next session.
His reply was:
"I beiieve tbat something will be done
in the way of passing the Dingley Dill or
some similar measure to provide for the
raising of more revenue. I don't antici
pate any opposition from tbe so-called
silver Senators to such a measnre as was
manifested at tbe last session. The ver
dict of tae people has been so overwhelm
ingly in favor of Republican principles
that I believe there will be a patriotic dis
position on tbe part of the silver Repub
licans to give those principles a fair trial.
I would amend the Dingley bill so as to
give greater protection to oranges, lemons,
prunes, raisins, wool, cattle and lumber.
I believe that the Nicaragua canal bill will
be taken up and passed at the next ses
sion.
â¢'I think that the funding railroad bill
will also be tafcen up at the next session.
This bill will be opposed by the Pacific
Coast delegation, with the single excep
tion of Grove Johnson of Sacramento, who
favors it."
When asked for his opinion with refer
ence to the disposition of the San Pedro-
Santa Monica harbor controversy, he said
tbe whole question was in the hands of
the commission of five engineers, which
would be here in a few days.
"The Lord only tnows what it will do.
I only know that two Government com
missions have heretofore decided that Ban
Pedro is the better place for the aeep-sea
harbor, and assuming that their decisions
were made upon scientific srounds I was
for San Pedro in the contest before the
last session of Congress. Assuming that
the former reports were based upon proper
grounds, we would naturally expect tiiat
tbe new commission will locate the har
bor at the same place for the same reason.
However, that commission is no child of
mine, and wherever the harbor is located
I shall ciaim no credit. And I shall dis
claim any blame for its creation if the har
bor is not located at the point desired by
our people."
STANFORD'S FRESHMAN GLEE.
First Event Under the Patronage of the
Newcomersâ Lively Race for an
Editorship.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Dec.
4.â The freshman glee passed off very
' smoothly this evening in the Encina Gym
nasium. For weeks past the sociai lights
of the freshman class have been planning
and arranging for the first event Â«iv a
under the class patronage. The decoratii
committee used great taste in covering up ,
the barren and unattractive walls of the
gymnasium. Boughs of evergreens and
potted plants served to brighten the gen
eneral appearance of the spacious room.
Misses Holmes, Haskell, Caidwell and T.
ii. Braden, C. G. Murphy. J. F. Lanigan
and C. Smith, as the freshman glee com
mittee, nad cnarge of the affair.
The dan<e programme consisted of
twenty numbers and four extra?, waltzes
and two steps alternating. Dancing was
continued until a latÂ« hour. Hubcr's
Hungarian Orchestra of San Francisco
supplied music. Light refreshments were
served during the evening. About fifty
couples were present and the affair was
vo ed a decided success.
Bishop John P. Newman, one of the
the distinguished leaders of the Methodist
church, will deliver the sermon in the
chapel next Sunday. He was a warm
friend of the late Senator Stanford and
preached the sermon at the luneral of
Leland Stanford Jr. Bishop Newman
has not been on the coast since 1884 and
will see Stanford University, with which
he has been associated, for the hrst time.
At the student body meeting to-day J.
R. Nourse '97 and W. C. McNeil '98
were nominated for the office of editor-in
chief of the Daily Palo Alto. Both of the
candidates for the position are decidedly
popular and will mako a hot race for t e
honor. Both have served on the paper.
At present McNeil is managing editor and
Nourse is an associate. The election will
take place a week from to-day. Mean
while the friends of the candidates wiil
muster their forces.
WALKED ON MOVING ICE.
Perilous Adventure of a Â»rry- Hoat Cap
tain on the Columbia.
PORTLAND, Or., Dec. 4.â Captain Hans
Jensen of the ferry-boat had a tnrilling
experience on the Columbia Kiver this
forenoon. Early in the morning he went
across on the ice to the Washington side
to arrange tor lowering the cable by
which the ferry runs. He started back
about 1 o'clock, when the ice was appar
ently solid, but when he had reached
the middle of the river the ice began
moving.
There was no alternative for him but to
keep straight ahead. He had on long
snowshoes and with their aid he was able
to keep on top of the moving body,
though it was a most dangerous under
taking. Every step bad to be guarded
with the greatest precaution, for the least
slip would have let nim down through the
moving mass.
For more than an hour the captain
wended his perilous journey, while hun
dreds of spectators watched him from the
shore. expecting every minute to see him
go down. He reached the ferry on this
side safely, and it was inCeed a relief to
those who had been watchine him as well
as to the captain.
San Diego Ueeition.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Dec. 4.â A decision
was rendeied to-day by Judge Torrance
sustaining the validity of the city Board
of Education operating under the city
charter. The question of legality came
up on the petition of Superintendent Cub
berley for a writ of mandxmus compell
ing County T easurer Tuompson to cash
the warrants of the Superintendent and
assistant clerk of the board. On advice of
the District Attorney, Ttiompson had re
fused to cash the warrants on the ground
that the board was illegal and not author
ized to employ salaried officials.

solvency, with debts of over $30,000.
Everything he has is mortgaged, and
many local creditors will suffer losses.
All of the property that could be secured
has been by the Bank of Santa. Cruz
County and the City Bank of Santa Cruz,
and wbenathese two^iireditors, with P. A.
Hihn & Co., are paid, nothing will be left
for unsecured creditors.
The voluntary insolvency proceedings
were a surprise to many, but to others not
unexpected. Cbace, without previous
hotel experience, undertook, with very lit
tle capital, to manage two of the largest
hotels in the Stateâ houses which needed
an experienced manager and a large re
serve fund.
Chace is 35 years of age. He was born
and raised in Santa Cruz. He was book
keeper for his father, J. D. Chace, in the
earJy eighties, and later was manager for
the Postal Telegraph Company. In 1887,
during the Santa Cruz boom, he purchased
tbe interest of Lucian Heath of the real
estate firm of| Heath & Drennan, and in
1890 T. V. Matthews, ex-County Assessor,
who now appears as the indorser of Chace 's
notes, purchased tbe interest oi Drennan,
making tbe firm Matthews & Cbace.
Chace sold to O. L. Tutle in 1892 and pur
chased with J. T. Sullivan the interest of
McCoilum & Barn v a rat in the Pacific
Ocean House, the purchase price being
$18,000. Chace put up balf ol this amount.
In 1893 he purchased Sullivan's interest
and alone continued the management of
the hotel until yesterday.
In 1895 Chace purchased the business of
the Sea Beach Hotel from Sullivan for
$11,000, and also assayed to run this alone.
While in the real estate business he ac
cumulated $20,000, which he invested in
a home and other real estate, and in order
to go into the notel business he mortgaged
these properties. From this date, through
lack of necessary experience, be lost heav
ily, and to meet bis liabilities mortgaged
every piece of property he owned and bor
rowed large sums of money on notes in
dorsed by Elizabeth Chace, T. V. Mat
thews, Libbie A. Swift, Robert Cardiff, C.
A. Rice and others. His business is now
practically owned by tbe City Bank and the
Bank of Santa Cruz County, the former
bavmg claims of $5800 and the Ja'tter $20,
-"**>, of which $1600 is an overdraft on
ounce's bank account. Owing to the de
preciated value of all city real estate it is
doubtful if tbe reaJ estate mortgaged will
return more than 60 per cent of its real
value, thus leaving a large deficit which
will fall upon a large number of local
creditors.
The petition in insolv ncy was filed by
Chace's attorneys, Lindsay & Casein, this
morning, and Superior Jud{;e Logan ap
pointed Sheriff Milton Besse receiver.
The hotels are now practically closed.
The hired help is clamoring for'recogni
tion. and rumors are flying fast as to what
will be the outcome, and under whose
management the hotel will be run in the
future. Among those mentioned are
Messrs. Leonard of Boulder Creek aud J.
T. Sullivan of San Francisco.
Yesterday, just before leaving, Chace
tried to remove an express wagon load of
his furniture, but it was stopped and re
turned to the hotel.
There is no doubt Chase lost his money
in the hotel ventures and not by gambling
or wild speculation. Among the heaviest
San Francisco creditors are: D. Politzer,
Hildebrandt- Posner Company, William
Woolf <fe Co., W. Pogen, Moore. Hunt &
Co., Goltlbere-Bowen Company, Wilmerd
ing-Loewe Company, Willard Bros., Cali
fornia Wine Association, Wetmore Bros.,
Crown Distilling Company, Michalitsche
Bros. Company, Siebe Bros. â & Plage
mann. â¢ Santa Cruz creditors suffer heavily,
among them being Williamson <feGarrett,
A. M. Johnston, Santa Oruz Elec.ric Light
and Power Company, A. Cohen, Charles
Bley, F. A. Hihn & Co. (probably secxi red,
but at present in doubt,) L ask & John
son, A. C. Snyder, H. Cowell & Co. and
Roberts & Chittenden.
The petitioner swears there is due $2000
as outstanding debts to him, from J. F.
Cunningham $200, Hyck Bros. $450, David
Wilson $425 and sundry smaller local
items. There ars at present foreshadowed
legal complications arising out ol the fol
lowing affidavit attached to the petition
in insolvency:
About December, 1895,petitionercontracted
wUh tbe City Bank to purchase the furniture
of tbe Sea Beach Hotel for $10,750. The said
City Bank holds certain promissory notes of
petitioner for the amount of said purchase
price, one of which promissory notes for the
principal sum of $3950 being signed by Lucy
Â£. Cbace, Robert Cardiff and C. A. Bice as
sureties. Petitioner has never received a bill
of sale for said furniture. The City Bank has
ever refused and still refuses to deliver such bill
of sale, claiming that the said furniture was not
to become the property of petitioner until said
purchase price had been paid and that until

For the reasons above gnm petitioner dps

W. D. Haalan, manager of the City
Bank, said that institution was amply se
cured. Officials of the Bank of Santa Cruz
County and l\ A. Hihn & Co., the owners
of the hotel property, refused to make any
statement and declined to outline their
standing in the premises, as the insol
vency proceedings affect them indivi
dually.

Miming Frnrn Port Ludlnw.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., Dec. 4.â
Much uneasiness is felt at Port Ludlow
over the disappearance of William Jack
son and Claude Poole, young hunters,
who left the mail steamer Starr at
Whiskey Spit, near Gamble, yesterday to
hunt ducks. They were to return and
join the steamer last night, and were in
no wise prepared 10 remain over night.
They were in a small boat and the fresh
breeze of last nigbt intensified fears for
the safety of the two boys. This afternoon
searching parties in small steamers visited
the adjacent shore near the inlet of Hood
canal, but no sinn of the hunters or their
boat could be found.

The proclamation of retaliation on the
part of our Government against German
charges on American shipping in their
ports has the possibility of developing se
rious results. The Kaiser may regard it as
an insult to his uniform.
In reply to a question as to what place
he was to have in the coming administra
tion Mr. Hanna is reported to have said:
"Never mind what it will be. You news
paper fellows are pretty smart, but I will
fool you all yet." Here is a chance to ex
ercise your guessing ability. What did
Hanna mean?
American retaliation against Germany
might justly be carried mnctt farther
than the President has done in his procla
mation. Our fruits and meats have been
excluded from German markets on the
pretense that they are unhealthy and this
has more or Jess injured the sale of them
in other countries. It is about time the
whole of this long discussed subject were
dealt with thoroughly and the present op
portunity for doing so should not be al
lowed to pass without profiting by it.
THE DISPUTE WITH GERMANY.
The President's proclamation of retalia
tion against the Germans for charges
levied on American vessels trading at the
portt of that country ought to have the
effect of bringing to a crisis the whole of
our long dispute with that country. It Is
full time that tnis should be done. For
years past the German Government has
endeavored to check the import of Ameri
can goods into that country by means
which are bo unfair as to furnish us with
a just cause for complaint and retaliation.
The abuse with which the President
deals in his proclamation is small com
pared with others which have been in
flicted upon our commerce with Germany.
The President confines his complaint to
the fact that German officials exact from
American vessels trading in their ports
certain tonnage dues, which are in excess
of what was agreed upon by treaty. He
therefore limits the extent of his retalia
tion to the levying of similar taxes upon
German vessels in American ports. This
is good enough as far as it goes, but there
are other issues which should be taken up
in connection with it
Germany has sought to exclude from
her markets American products of all
kinds. If this exclusion had been pro
vided for by a system of protective duties
for the benefit of German industries we
would have no right to complain. This,
however, is not the way in which the ex
clusion has been made. "While nominally
leaving our exports free to enter Ger
many, subject to certain tariff duties, the
officials of that Government have persist
ently excluded them for the alleged reason
that they are improperly prepared and
pernicious to the health of consumers.
On charges of this kind, American" food
products of all sorts have been excluded
from German markets. American cattle
have been shut out on the pretext that
they were tainted with Texas fever.
American pork and bacon have been ex
cluded on the ground that they contain
trichinae. Even American fruits have
been refused admission to the country
upon the foolish allegation that they are
impure, unhealthful and dangerous.
It will be seen that the exclusion of our
product* from Germany on such pretexts
as these is au injury to us in more wayg
than one. The assertions of the German
officials that American food products are
unhealthy naturally tend to diminish the
demand for them in other countries. By
reason of these allegations, we suffer,
therefore, not in the markets of Germauy
only, but in the markets of the whole
world.
Complaints on the subject have been
repeatedly made, and it is full time that
our Government should take some de
cided action concerning them. It" the
Germans wish to exclude American
products from their country, they nave
the right to do so, but they have no right
to base that exclusion upon false pre
tenses. The country, therefore, while sup
porting Mr. Cleveland in his proclamation
of retaliation, would have done so more
cordially if he had made it more sweep
ing and more vigorous.
THE BRITISH LEAGUE.
The proceedings of the British Empire
League at the meeting on Thursday were
of a nature widely different from those
which have usually been taken in such
assemblies. The talk on Thursday was of
war and colonial defense, instead of the
well-worn theme of commerce and the
federation of the empire.
The Duke of Devonshire, who made the
principal address, devoted his attention
almost wholly to the progress which has
been made in recent years for colonial de
fense. This progress he attributed mainly
to the work of the league, and spoke of it
as an essential element in the bond which
holds together the widespread empire of
Great Britain.
in former meetings the discussion of the
league has been directed mainly to the
extension of British commerce and the
endeavor to formulate some means by
which Great Britain could retain almost
all the trade of her colonies. These dis
cussions have always proved futile. The
more important colonies of the empire
have long since set up for themselves in
their commercial affairs, and imposed
tariff duties to protect their home indus
tries against British competition. It has
been in vain that efforts were made to
bring about a general agreement for abso
lute free trade between all the colonies of
the mother country. The difficulties in
the way seem to be insuperable, and it
appears now that attempts in that direc
tion have been at least temporarily aban
doned.
The new policy of the league as outlined
by the meeting is to develop a military
unit throughout the empire, instead of a
commercial one. The league proposes to
confirm the loyalty of the colonists by
demonstrating to them what England is
prepared to do in their defense in case of
any possible war. Devonshire declared
that the British Government attaches the
greatest importance to the renewal of some
form of naval arrangements with Aus
tralia, and expressed the belief that the
opportunity would soon be taken to re
open the whole question of colonial de
fense.
The Lord Mayor, who presided at the
meeting, seems to regard the new policy
as much better than the old. He spoke of
it at any rate as "a great scheme for the
absolute and perfect unity of the British
empire." Like the Duke of Devonshire,
he appears to esteem the plan of promot
ing loyalty by an appeal to the military
spirit as even more effective than the for
mer attempts to devise commercial trea
ties.
All the speakers at the meeting ex
pressed a sanguine belief that the British
Government would carry out the plans
devised by the league, and it seems proba
ble therefore that Great Britain's expen
diture for war purposes will be much
larger in the future than was expected by
the taxpayers of the country when Parlia
ment made its last appropriation for the
increase of the navy.
STREET IMPROVEMENT.
The celebration which the merchants
and property-owners of Sixth street have
devised for this evening will serve to some
extent as a general celebration by the
whole City of the beginning ef a new era
in the work Of street improvement. What
has been accomplished on Sixth street is
very little in comparison with what
should be done throughout the City, but
at any rate it is a distinct step in advance
and to t&at extent is well worthy of com
memoration.
The work which merchants and im
provement clubs are doing for San Fran
cisco is much greater than is generally
supposed. It appears small only in com
parison with the vast amount of work
which ought to be done. Our streets need
improvements of all kinds. They should
be better lighted, better paved, better
swept, better sprinkled, better constructed
and better sewered. Where so much is
required even an important improvement
hardly makes a showing sufficient to its
merits; but it helps at any rate to hasten
the coming of the time wiieu a complete
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 5, 1896.
improvement will be made and our streets
rendered worthy of a City of the impor-
I tance of San Francisco.
One of the first things needed in our
streets is the removal of the cobblestones
which now constitute such a ruisance to
the comfort of the people and entail such
a heavy cost upon those who are engaged
in traffic. The current number of the
Merchants' Association Review has a terse
editorial on this subject, which is worth
quoting in full. The Review says:
Who would think of using the antiquated
mailcoach in these days of steam and elec
tricity ? It is equally absurd and astonishing
for a modern city to tolerate cobbles upon its
principal streets. The cobbled blocks on Post,
Geary and Stockton streets in the very heart
of San Francisco are not only disgraceful to
this metropolis but also detrimental to the
trade and welfare of the City. By all means
let the property-owners along those blocks join
heartily in the movement of the Merchants'
Association lor the absolute extermination of
this relic of a bygone era. Adopt a modern,
sanitary, noiseless pavement, and your prop
erty will enhance in value and your City be
saved such a Silurian spectacle.
The argument thus stated requires no
elaboration. The people of San Francisco
are well aware of the defects of the City in
this respect. ThÂ«y have a full sympathy
with all who are now working to bring
about the needed improvements. They
should, however, have something more
than sympathy. They should have the
energy and public spirit to give a hearty
co-operation in the work. The existence
of so many improvement clubs among us
is a good thing in itself; but all the same
it is a sign of something lacking in our
municipal government. We should not
leave to private individuals a work which
ought rightly to be done by the com
munity as a whole.
"THE SUNDAY CALL."
In to-morrow's issue of The Call will
appear a wealth of timely features. The
Btory of "Six Little Heroes in the Battle
of Life" is one that will appeal to all
hearts. The tale that is told Is not one
wherein fiction claims the major part, nor
in which fiction has any part at all. It is
a story of real conditions, and every word
of it is true.
The heroes are, generally, poor and
friendless. From San Francisco's man
sions of luxury and ease will certainly
come a response that will render the pa
thetic longings of these brave children not
in vain. Of heroes on fields of war, of
noble deeds on sea and shore, the books
are full ; but fame knows not the names
of the heroes of whom Jean Morris tells in
The Sunday Call. They have borne up,
like toldien, under dreadful sufferings,
and their agonies fell to them through no
fault of their own.
The gracious Christmas time is near
ing, and there is no telling how
much pain and doom may be driven
out of young lives by even such trifling
remembrances as tiny dolls, or toy drums,
or wooden soldiers, or picture-books, or
candy. U will make fortune-favored chil
dren happier at Yuletide to know that
their offerings on the altar of pitying
kindness will bring smiles to faces that
were almost born to sadness aad joy to
souls that can hardly bear their over
weight of woe.
In addition there are some odd and pecu
liar sketches apropos of the season of Ad
vent, and Culver has illustrated them in
his characteristically clever way.
Few occupations in life offer more thrill
ing experiences than that of the railroad
engineer, and the "Stories of the Engine
cab" will be eagerly read, the more so be
cause they are written by oiu engineers
themselves.
An exciting account of a bicyclist's wild
ride, whirling along through space in the
teeth of a gale and making the fastest mile
on record, will interest everybody and
especially the devotees of the bike.
The page devoted to "Childhood's
Realm"' is more than usually entertaining
this week. Ours is the only children's
pace published on the Pacific Coast which
is almost entirely edited by the children
of California themselves.
The female Jack Tar of the Barbary
Coast is the subject of a very readable
sketch, and there is a large amount of
other capital Sunday matter, ably written
and well illustrated.
The different departments are fully up
to their usual standard of excellence, and
as far as news and dispatches are con
cerned The Call, as in the other in
stances, is far in the lead of its contem
poraries. Nobody should fail to get The
Sunday Call. It is a veritable library of
literature and news of the day, and all it
costs is 5 centÂ«.
THE HORSELESS CAB.
A SYSTEM OF SELF-PROPELLED VEHICLE FOB
London.
There Is no doubt, says the Graphic, that we
shall soon see a greit change come over the
traffic in the streets of London. Horses for
public vehicles will be the exception, and the
terrible spectacle of these poor creatures strug
gling ana falling down in the slippery streets
will be a rare one when once the auto-motor
vehicles are fairly tried. A service of auto
motor carriages is about to be established by
the London Electrical Cab Company. Auto
motor cars are now to be allowed to travel at
A London Electric Cab.
the rate of twelve miles an hour, provided
thcyjare not nbove a certain weight, and there
is no doubt that when they come into general
use, as undoubtedly they will In a short time,
the pressure of the traffic will be considerably
lightened. Not only will each vehicle take up
less room, but there will not be the frequent
delay caused by a fallen horse blocking the
â¢stream of traffic, so that the maximum pace of
twelve miles an hour will not be so impossible
as might at first be thought.
The company proposes to begin business
with. 350 cabs. These cabs will be most hand
somely appointed. They will be fitted with
SDrlug cushions, green and gold curtains,
glass fronts and electric lamps. They will be
well lighted inside, besides carrying the
lamps at the sides which are common to all
cabs. The driver of these electric cabs will,
like the drivers ot the ordinary handsome
cabs, have a lefty seal from which he will be
able to get a full view of fi.e traffic on all
side*. Only in the case of the new vehicles
the drivers will be in front of their passengers,
but so seated as not wholly to obscure the
view of their fares. The driver will control
his cab by two handles, by one of which he
will regulate the pace, and by the other he
will steer. The cabs are fitted with reversing
gear that is p rfect. But in order to make the
vehicles absolutely safe each is supplied with
a foot-brake which will enable the driver to
stop it instantly. The whee.s of the electric
cab are tired with indiarubber.

NOGUCHI AND HIS CRITIC
a Japanese View of the Alleged Plagiar-
ismt of the JÂ»oeÂ«.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir:
I request the courtesy of The Call for the
use of your columns to expose our opinion
about the articles in which Rev. Jay William
Hudson attached M. Yone Noguchi. Dear sir,
I need not necessarily ask your courtesy for
the defense of our young Japanese poet on a
charge of plagiarism but for a reason which
shows co often the difference of standards for
the plagiarism. Our oriental seems ap
proaching at present to the conclusion of the
question oi plagiarism, being so old a country
that so many poets suffered with that charge
and so tired now with that gossip; but at least
this question is always worthy enough to illus
trate the genius of the so-called plagiarist
and the possibility to produce the same
thought in exactly the same words â the mat
ter of interesting coincidence.
The ancient Chinese poet, 'Kay v," has some
lines quoted thus:
On the watery field, the white stork hops.
Among the summer trees the yellow bird chin tera.
And the certain famous poet at the same age,
"O-i," who sang his poetry of the same
thought in almost the same words with
"Kayu" was ever proud to show to the public
his line?, which quoted thus:
On the watery field, dim and dim, the stork bops.
â¢ Among the summer trees, gloomy and gloomy, the
yellow bird chutiers.
And after them the ambitious Chinese poet,
whose name is written with the spell "Cnoy
oku," wrote his poetry with a few changes,
thus:
I see just on the watery field the white storic hops.
I hear now among Jthe summer trees the yellow
bird chatters.
Some one among these poets ought to be the
plagiarist. II the old person could claim its
originality on the foundation that any other
poet did not sing before such thought with
the same words the other poets, "O-i" and
"Choyoku," must be charged as the shameful
plagiarists; but, being not so in our oriental
country,, the people compare ever who can
be praised as the highest genius among them.
Mr. O-i, elected as the loremost persorC leaves
his high honor to our future age. Why, this
Is the question of poetry !
Mr. Noguchi's poem, entitled "Lines," being
fortunately compared with "The Sleeper," a
poem of the late Allan Poe, who has so many
devoted admirers in this world, and was ac
knowledged as the first poet ever the Ameri
can could produce perhaps, suffers as the
plagarist at present. I wonder why the people
compares not which poetry has more founda
tion as the originality and expresses . more
poetical high thought-in one expression,
which person lias more genius of the poetry.
We never claim the poem of the young Japan
ese poet more superior than the Poe's produc
tion; but, for instance, Mr. Noguchi stealing
the lines irom the exoteric American geniusâ
I dwelt alone
In v wor.d of moan,
And my soul was a stagnant tide.
If the young Japanese poet made out his
"Lines," which singing thus:
I dwell alone.
Like one-e td star,
In frightened, darksome, willow threads,
In wor d of moan,
My soul is stagnant downâ
finally rushes down with the strength of
thundery groan, asking what he may has â
**.**; Godâ
Demonâ lightâ
Darunessâ Oh !
We must feel for him why he cannot be so
satisfied with the plagiarist. Oh, poor little
boy poet, you be contented with the thief of
anotner poet, but you might believe that there
are many persons who estimate your genius
more original and more higher than the dead
poet. About the critic which denies to him
the right to such adj ctlves or verbs as "mvs
tlc," "dewy, dim," "steals drowsily," "wan
ton," "closed and prized," we have fortun
ately none oi the words to answer. Mr. No
guchi made out bravely with such words,
"mystic" and "opiate vapor, dewy, dim,"
hiring from Poe his first three lines ot "Lines."
1 am compelled to admire ana love his talent.
For tne second article of Rev. Jay William
Hudson the Examiner shared ."ler editorial
column, defending the young poet. There's
no necessity to expose again the certain
preacher's ioolishnets. . T. \V atari.

THE BARBERS' CONVENTION.
New York Sun.
There are 60,000 barbers in the United
States and their representatives in this State
are to hold a convention at Syracuse in Janu
ary for the purpose of preparing a bill for sub
mission to the Legislature to remedy their
grievances.
It appears that these grievances have grown
to be many and various. The rudimentary
education of some barbers Is wofully neglect
ed The pay of journeymen is insufficient in
amount and irregular in collection. Much
demoralization has followed the per nteious
system of "tips," ami worse than all, the se
curity of the trade and the emoluments or
dexterous and competent barbers are put in
peril by the intrusion of newcomers advertis
ing "5 cent shaves." The teaching of the bar
bers' art in what are known as "ihe Darbers
colleges" is described as imperfect. The con
vention accordingly is expected to decide
upon a bill providing for the establishment oi
a "State Examining Board for Barbers, with
the right to summon witnesses and call ior
books or papers, to impose fines, exact fees,
grant, ameud and revoke barbers' licenses,
and prosecute civilly and criminally, Dut
more especially criminally, those who attempt
to act as barbers without suitable credentials.
A precedent for the barbers has been estab
lished in the law adopted ior the horseshoers,
which requires that every man who shoes a
horse must have a license from the Board of
Examining Horseshoers. Who is there
who will say that it the hcofs of the
horse are to be saved by statutory en
actment from unskillful, unpracticed and
improper hands, the head of a man, the
seat of his intelligence and the abiding place
of his knowledgu and philosophy, if he has
any, should not likewise be protected from un
sophisticated, incompetent, ignoble and de
vastating barber*? Why, ask the barbers,
should not the protession of the "tonsorial
artist" be restored to the position of honor and
distinction wnich it occupied la the old days,
where, in many places, surgeon barbers took
rank with duly licensed physicians, and the
hairdressers of some monarchical courts took
precedence of cooks and maintained it with
undeviating firmness against tiio cabals of
statesmen and the conspiracies of politicians 1
If the State takes the barber business "into
Its own hands," as the journeymen barbers
propose, may not an end be put to the
texKtious competition of the "5-cent shave"
establishments, and may not the unsuspect
ing patron who gives a diligent ana efficient
barber a "lip" soou find himself f*ce to face
with the law and prosecuted, perhaps by no
lesa a functionary than "the attorney for the
State Examining Board of Barbers?" These
matters will come up for settlement when the
barbers from all over the State assemble for
sage deliberation at Syracuse next January.
Let us hope that the more progressive and en
lightened barbers of the town will not with
hold their active support Irom the movement
to raise the standard of the barbers' business
by a more rigid apprenticeship.
It is to be iioped, too, that the temptations
to loquacity which many journeymen barbe/s

now find it nearly impossible to resist will not
combine to unduly delay tfce proceedings of
the January convention; and that the rule 01
"next," the watchword of the barber-shop,
will be rigorously applied to debaters under
the five-minute rule. Moreover, no claims ot
tonics or hair dyes should detract the atten
tion of the delegates from the more important
work of attempting to stamp out the 5-cent
shave shops, conducted, some of them, there
is reason to fear, by journeymen who have
greater knowledge how to wield an ax than to
manipulate a razor. Harmony and union
among the barbers are prerequisites to a suc
cessful convention In January. Let there be
no unseemly contention, no razors displayed
and none concealed !

It is a repetition of the worry and fear
of the North Cosmopolitan School princi
pal for nearly a year past, and which, by
the way, are not yet at an end. for the
North Cosmopolitan schoolhouse and
yards have been in the hands of contract
ors, at the imminent risk of children's
limbs.
Last summer the School Department
undertook to improve the Cooper School
so that it might be habitable by pupils
during winter months. A bulkhead,
erected when the street was raised in front
at considerable expense to the depart
ment, had fallen in, and with it went the
3idewalk. The yard of the school was in
a disgraceful condition, but it was paved
with bituminous rock and a masonry sus
taining wall was erected along the line of
Sidewalk in Front of the Schoolhouse on Filbert Street, Between
Taylor and Jones*
Greenwich street. This with some other
Improvements constituted the school
board's part of the contract
There still remained a great hole be
tween the wall and the street, and this
was filled by Contractor John Dallam on
a private contract with the Superintendent
of Streets. Dallam at once proceeded to
finish the job. He leveled off the earth
almost even with tbe new granite curbs,
and then laid a coating of concrete and
cement for the patent stone sidewalk.
This worjc appeared well enough, for the
Broken Sidewalk in Front of the Schoolhouse on Greenwich
Street, Between Jones and Leavenworth.
sidewalk was smooth and level; besides,
it wore all right until the last rain came.
Then the ground sank several feet and the
patent stone cracked and fell into great
boles where whole squares stand on edge.
The new sidewalk became a wreck and
a menace to the safety of tbe children at
tending the school. And now the teach
ers are constantly worried lest one of
their charges might fall into a rut and be
injured.
Superintendent of Schools Babcock ex
amined the stone sidewalk and took a
sample of it to his otlice. In showing tbe
piece of cement he remarked : "It is about
as thick efc paper," and it really was not

of the clerks stated that the cement was

went to pieces when the rain got through
tho cracks.
The contract for this part of the work
was let against the advice of the Street
Inspector, but so far it has not been paid
for by the Supervisors. Superintendent
of Streets Ashworth was surprised to hear
of the matter and stated that he would
make an investigation at once. So it is
highly probable that the whole thing must
be done over again before payment will be
made by the Supervisors.
More than a year ago contractors took
hold of the North Cosmopolitan school-
House on Filbert street, near Jones. The
work was finisned in due time, but, like
the Cooper School case, the yard flooring
sank. The bulkhead on Filbert street
broke and fell in, and School Director
Henderson, chairman of the Buildings
and Grounds Committee of the board,
caused the dangerous places to be fenced
and the ruts to be planked over. The
sum of $500 was withheld on the contract,
with the result that the contractor had to
go over his work a second time. And yet
the sidewalk is left in a dangerous condi
tion. For about half the length of the lot
there is v hummocky patch of bituminous
rock upon the sidewalk, while the other
half is a broken surface with heaps of
debris and deep holes scattered about.
And over them the children have to pass
to get into and out of the school.

gleaned and cleverly reviewed, whether it
occurred in the political, musical, dramatic,
literary or social world. A number of ex

A NEW INDUSTRY
AT NORTH BEACH
The Preserving and Ship
ping of Lumber Pro
gressing.
Central America and China Send
Orders for the Creosoted
Lumber.
Vessels That Came Here Expecting to
Get Wheat Charters Have B?en
Disappointed.
The preserving of piles and timbers from
the ravages of the toredo lias become quite
an industry at North Beach. Several con
corns have gone into the business and in
consequence the old section on which
Meiggs wharf used to stand is now one of
the busiest on the water front. The bulk
of the work is done by creosoting and lat
terly shipments of creosoted piles and
lumber have been sent to Central and
South America and the last 'steamer for
China took away a large consignment to
be used in the harbor at Hongkong. All
the piles, or neariy all those used by the
Harbor Commissioners, are treated at the
works, and it is estimated that the new
process adds at least five years to the age
of a pile. Broadway wharf is to be repiled
and over 500 piles will be required. It will
be a year before the new pier can be built
and if it had not been for the creosoting
process the piles now to be driven would
not last out the year. As it is President
Colnon says that when the commission
comes to rebuild the wharf next year the
piles will be as good as new and they can
De used over again.
When the Ban Francisco Timber Pre
servine Company first put in its works at
North' Beach an attempt was made to
carry its timbers over the roadway and
wharf to the vessels alongside. At that
time The Call protested against tbe
State's roadway being put to such a use
and tbo company abandoned tbe project.
Now all the piles and timber are run into
the bay through an underground tunnel.
Another process employed at North
Beach is the wapping of piles in tarred
linen, and still a third is the parafflne
paint process. The conglomeration of
smells is not pleasant, but as it brings
work and money to North Beach, the resi
dents do not mind. The creosoting works
are running night and day and P. F. Dun
don says the venture is a success.
There was a goose-chase on the bay yes
terday. Davie Kramer was bringing home
a bird from Fort Point, but lost it on the
way. As the goose was to be fattened for
Christmas Davie was anxious to bring it
home. He bent to the oars, but the bird
was quicker than he and always eluded
the Whitehall. The boys from Meiggs
wharf joined in the chase and Davie picked
up his fowling-piece to kill the bird, but
while taking aim be lost his balance and
/ell into the bay. Jimmy Welch secured
the goose, and when Davie was taken
ashore he found himself minus a gun and
a bird, as Welch was well on his way up
Telegraph Hill by that time.
Boatman Scott, while rowing along the
front yesterday, wicked up a valise, in
which were a quantity of clothing and a
New Testament. In the latter was written:
"Charles Anderson. City and County Hos
pital, WardC"; also the names Herr"ock
son Sveree, Sven Durd and August Dura.
All the articles smell of creosote, and if
there was a suicide the chances are the
unfortunate jumped overboard from
Powell-street, wharf. Sergeant Hayes ia
of the opinion that some man just released
from the City and County Hospital ended
his life last Thursday night.
The British tramp steamer Progressist
is ready to sail for India, and will get
away to-day. She has aboard 5200 toni
of wheat, and her captain insist that she
should have at teast 1500 tons more.
He demanded that his vessel be loaded
down to the Plimsol mark, but the sur
veyors refused to allow his demand. The
tramp has been running in the Dansmuir
line for twenty months, and during that
time has never had a serious breakdown.
Chief Engineer J. M. Norton, who came
here with the vessel, has been more than
successful in the management of tbe en
gine-room, and when tbe number of acci
dents that have happened to other tramps
is taken into consideration the vessel's
owners should be gratified. Mr. Nor
ton has made many friends in San Fran
cisco, and should he ever return he will
be made more than welcome.
Since July last fifty-six British ships
have arrived here in ballast seeking grain
cargoes, and of that number twenty-one
are still disengaged. Many of them are
now tied up for the winter in Sausalito,
Oakland Creek and Mission Bay, while
others are in the stream waiting for the
"off chance." The Glencona was char
tered to arrive for 28s 9d, but the charter
was abandoned, and she is now reloading
for Balfour, Guthrie & Co. at 18Â« 9d per
ton. The Bacchus, from Taltal, waa char
tered to arrive at 28s 9s, but there is no
sign of her and the charter expires in a
few days. The Sutlej was chartered to ar
rive in at 27s 6d, but there is no sign of
her and the charter has expired. All in
all, English ship-owners have not done
well this season.
James Hammond, who was for yearn
one of the Merchants' Exchange reporters
at Meiggs wharf, died yesterday. He left
the em ploy of the exchange some time ago,
and on several occasions served in politi
cal, situations.
The Chrysomene Rot in from sea last
night. Two days ago she refused a tow
and after Captain Hogan vainly attempted
to make harbor for forty-eight hours he
gave it up and accepted a tow. The voy
age was uneventful.
The Southern Pacific's ferry steamers
had a lively time of it in the fop; yesterday
morning. The Oakland nearly ran down
the ship Fairport in tow of the tug Sea
King and the Encinal made Fisherman's
wharf instead of the ferry slip. There
was no damage reported.
THE PRINCE'S DENIAL.
Ponlatowskl's Secretary Asserts That
the Story About a London
Creditor la False.
Prince Ponlatowski. who is president of
large mining syndicates, is not in San Fran
cisco, but the Princess is here at the residence
of William H. Crocker. The Prince is on the
Mother Lode looking after his mining inter
ests. In regard to the published statement
that the-Prince had contracted debts in Eng
land and that Messrs. Maple & Co. of London
were pursuing him with legal papers to collect
the sum of $9000 for furniture obtained from
that firm, a positive denial of Its truth comes
from the family of Poniatowski. The secre
tary of the Prince said last night: "You can
deny on the very best of authority the state
ments published this eveniug."
When asked if the Princess authorized a
contradiction of the story the secretary re
iterated the statement: '"The Call is author
ized on the best of authority to say that there
is no truth whatever in the story."
THE POLICE TRIBUNAL.
One Officer Dismissed From the Force
and Another Resigns.
The Police Commissioners held a meet
ing Thursday night and two vacancies
on the force were created.
Policeman Dennis Murphy was charged
with un officer like conduct in being in
toxicated while on duty and failing to re
port on duty, and was dismissed from the
force. Charges had been preferred against
Policeman Austin J. Langford, but rather
than face them he tendered his resigna
tion, which was accepted.
Policeman Nathaniel Green was fined
$25 for neglect of duty, and Policeman
Frank McOrayan,. $10 fcr being absent
from his beat. A charge of neglect of
duty against Policeman John R. O'Connor
was dismissed.

Charles Dyer was arrested in Oakland last
night on a warrant from Police Court 3, this

J. C. Dyer. He was brought across the bay
and detained at the city Prison on a charge of
petty larceny.
STEW TO-DAY.'
THE NEW WAVE.
Physical Culture, Pure Food and Drink
Mark a New Kra.
A great, popular, pure drinK and pure
food wave is just now passing over the
country, and it stems to have come to
stay.
More attention is being given to articles
of food and drink than heretofore, and
people are slowly learning that good
nealth cannot be preserved under
the present civilization unless the
habits are of a more natural character.
The apparently harmless coffee habit now
numbers its victims by the thousands,
producing obstinate stomach and bowel
troubles that will not abate except by
leaving oft the habit.
It is not always an easy task to drop a
lifetime habit.
One of tbe late discoveries is a pure food
coffee, made entirely of grains and pos-
sessing great fattening and nourishing
properties, while it brews the exact deep
seal brown color of Mocha, and when
cream is anded it takes the rich golden
brown ot old Java. The taste is pungent
and piquant, auite similar to coffee; in
fact so close to It in aroma and flavor that
the coffee-drinker who has had trouble
with coffee will freely take on the new
grain drink when he discovers that it
agrees with him perfectly and its health-
ful properties quickly dismiss his former
ails.
Tbe great feature of this new and ra-
tional method oi dismissing sickness is to
avoid drugging oneself and quit hurtful
habits, taking in only what is known to
be pure natural food such as the Creator
intended for man's subsistence.
Dr. Wesley A. Uunn, Editorof "Medical
Current," Marshall Field Building, C'hi-
caeo, says: "I am highly pleased with it."
Nothing is more to the point than this
new food-drink, made from grains. It
bears tbe name of "Postum Cereal." and
is made by the Postum Cereal Company
(limited),' Battle Creek, Mich.
it claims to be a direct and quick pro-
ducer of new blood corpuscles by the nat-
ural method of good nourishing food
taken in a liquid form. It is quite a bit
less expensive than coffee and altogether
its use appeals to one's common sense.
Beware of the fraudulent imitations of
tbe original Postum Cereal Grain coffee.
Insist on Postum.
HEALTH BOARD
HAS TAKEN WATER
Will No Longer Attempt
to Control the
Schools.
Attorney McEierney Tells the
Members They Have Ex
ceeded Their Powers.
Seven New Cases of Diphtheria Re
ported at the Health Office Yes
terdayâOne Death.
The Board of Health has been com
pelled to take water in its fight with the
Bjanl of Education, and it will not an
swer the injunction suit.
The matter came to a head yesterday
afternoon when a special meeting was
called to hear the opinion of the board's
attorney on the subject.
The members evidently knew what was
coming, for Dr. Fitzgibbon moved that the
board go into executive session to hear the
report. What transpired beyond the
closed doors of the assembly-room none
but the doctors and the employes know,
but the faces of the members were long
when they emerged. Attorney McEnerney
was more communicative and in a few
short sentences related what he had tola
the board.
"I simply told the board that it had no
right to close the schools, and tDat its po
sition in the matter could not be sustained
in court," he said.
"Then you must have told them they
had gone beyond their province and ex
ceeded their authority ?" said a reporter.
"I informed the members that I could
find nothing in the statutes to justify their
action," was the evasive answer.
Health Officer Lovelace let the. cat out
of the bag after the meeting.
"We knew beforehand what McEner
ney's opinion would be," he said, "but we
went ahead anyway to see what we could
do. We made a fight, anyway."

a member of the Board of Education said :
"This is just in Jine with the arroeant
actions of the Health Department. With
a fnll knowledge that it couid not sustain
its position it goes ahead and puts us to

"The closing of the schools for even aday
in such a manner is conducive to bad disci

ings again. Supposing some one had been

THE WHEELMEN.
Velodrome Meet This Afternoon and
Associated Clubs To-NlgCQt.
Cyclers and those interested in tne sport
have two things in which they will take
particular interest to-day. , One is the

and there are more entries and a better
class of performers. Tbe arrival of Mc-
Farland and Stevens during the week
must stimulate the California profession
als to renewed efforts, for they will have
to ride to win out from either of these two
"pros." Wilber Knapp also got in from
Chicago and will act as announcer, at
which he is without a peer, unless it be
George Dixon. As Knapp laughingly said
one day, "They may tie me, but they
can't beat me," and so it is.
The races this afternoon will commence
promptly at 2 o'clock. Seats should be
secured in advance, and can be had at
Sherman & Clay's. There will be a large
attendance, judging by the advance sale.
It was rumored at the track yesterday
that "Bob" Ternll would forfeit tbe shield
racÂ° to W. Â£. Beckar, wno challenged him,
and go in for the professional events. This
iaonly another evidence of the worthy
Terriil's foresiphtedness. If tie wins the
match race he only wins $20. In the pro
fessional race he has a cbance of winning
$50. The shield event might be made
more interesting if the management made
its possession a little more valuable. '

The following clubs belonging to the as
sociction have not .pent in the names of
their delegates, and unless tbe names are
sent to tbe secretary to-day they will not
be entitled to vote: Crescent Athletic Club
of Berkeley, Crescent Road Club, Call
Bicycle Club, Diamond Cyclers, East Oak
land Wheelmen, Liberty Cycling Club,
Mountain View Cyciers, Olympic Cyclers
and Triangle Wheelmen. Of these the
two Crescent clubs are said to be out of
existence, and the Call, Diamond and Tri
angle Wheelmen will probably withdraw
lrom the association as its purposes does
not interest them.
All delegates must bring credentials of
their appointment from tne secretaries of
their respective clubs to the meeting to
night toentitle them to a seat. Chairman
of deletions must come prepared to pay
tli<* annual dues also.
There is going to be a big contest over
the presidency between A.^P. Swain
of the Acme Club Wheelmen of Oak
land and A. W. Webe of the San
Francisco Road Club, but a careful
canvass of the delegates made yester
day gives Swain a majority of ten votes
to a certainty and possibly more. His
long association with the sport has made
him scores of friends, particularly as such
services as he has rendered iv different
official capacities have been rendered with
peculiar cleverness and discretion. As a
member of the last road-racing committee
he managed the big twenty-mile road race
in July, and it passed off without a
hitch. This was the more remarkable be
cause there had never been a similar event
held here before, and he had no precedent
to go by. Mr. Swain promises, if elected,
to appoint a San Francisco man as chair
man of the road-racing committee, and
that has brought him lots of votes from
this side.
Mr. Wehe has been connected with the
sport for a considerable time, but is not
well known outside of his own club, whose
support has been remarkably strong dur
ing his canvass. Many think he should
not have aspired higher than the first
vice-presidency this year, particularly
when he had a man like Swain to run
against, and even now he may be induced
to accept that nomination instead. In
case of bis election tbe road-racing chair
manship would probably go to W. I. Pix
ley of the Road Club. The election will
be well contested, however, and to-night's
meeting full of incidents.
Warm but loose-iitting clothing is abso
lutely necessary to comfort in coid
weather riding. Most wheelmen and
wheelwomen find it a difficult matter to
keep tbe hands and feet warm in the face
of a cold wind. Bicycle gauntlets may be
all right in their way, but a pair of heavy
woolen gloves which will reach well up
the wrists seems better. A silk or cotton
stocking under the regular golf hose, with
a piece of paper fitted between tbe two
stockings, is guaranteed to keep out the
cold in the most bitter weather. A sheet
of newspaper fitted between tbe under
shirt and sweater or outing shirt will also
protect the chest completely.
The League of American Wheelmen
has passed tbe 70,000 mark in member
ship, now numbering 70,363. North Cali
fornia has 1639, Soutn California 460 and
Oregon about as many. The growth of
the latter division has been phenomenal.
New York has '20,468. The annual meet
ing of the North California Division will
be held next Saturday night, and Secre
tary-Treasurer Scovern has sent out the

GUN AND GAME.
Good Snlpe-Shootinsr In the Country
Clubâ bucking at Antioch.
It is said that duck-shooting in the So
noma marshes has been very poor this
season and the sportsmen who frequent
those marshes attribute their poor luck to
the great amount of pbooting that has
been done this year at night by men who
hunt for the market.
As there are thousands of wild decks in
San Pablo Bay at present tbe outlook for
some good sport in tbe near future is
promising.
A good stiff blow from the west will
send the biros into tbe marshes, but a
heavy rainstorm will result in destroying
the shooting near tbe bay, as the ducks
will leave for the southern country.
The secretary of the San Joaqum Valley
Agricultural Association writes that he
has received the medals and diplomas won
at the late Stockton bench sliow and is
now prepared to distribute them.
George Jackson bagged quite a number
of mallard and teal a few days ago on
Lake San Andreas, which sheet of water
is the property of the Spring Valley Water
Company.
J. Wallace and Fred Greenlee enjoyed a
good duck-shoot near Suisun last Monday.
They positively state that the birds did
not cost them any more than what they
paid for ammunition and transportation.
Sam Hughes, alias Silver-tongue Sam,
and his English setter, Silver Plate 11, had
a most enjoyable outing in the Country
Club of Marin County last Sunday. Billy
Kittle states that Hughes is "good" on
quail, but a very rank shot on English
snipe.
The following letter has been received
and speaks for itseli:
Antioch, Cal., Dec. I.M
Duck-shooting is first-class now and a good
shot can secure a good bag of birds. J. L;m
mer, with shells loaded with "Gold Dust"
powder by William Remfree of Antiucn, killed
thirty-two mallards aud about twenty-eight
blackjacks. Dick Brooks of San Francisco, an
old-time sport whose eyesight Is either getting
poor or his No. 10 gun growing old, got four
ducks and a ducking. Mr. Lemmer claimed
that the four ducks secured by Brooks weie
cripples that he had knocked down himself.
Mr. Brooks used to be a pretty fair duck shot,
but, like Remfree, he is a good old "has been."
Mr. Brooks is very indignant that he
should be classified among the "has
beens," and states that if Air. Remfree,
who is the acknowledged champion "tin
can" shooter of San Joaquin County, is
anxious for a race on artificial birds or live
birds, he will meet him at any time and
place 1 he may suggest purposely to ar
range a contest. Brooks states further
that Mr. Remfree may use a 10-bore gun
and that he will handle a pea-shooter, as
that kind of gun will be large enough for
him in a contest ot this kind.
Phil Bekeart bageed a good mess of wild
ducks last Sunday in Suisun marsh.
Walter Burlineame and Jim Chesley
returned from Suisun last Sunday with
thirteen birds.
Frank Vernon had an excellent Bnipe
shoot on tne Country Club's marsh last
Sunday. He reports birds as being very
plentiful.
Frank Dolliver says that the weather
was so cold at Point Reyes last Sunday
that his dog had much difficulty in re
trieving birds he had Killed and which fell
into the pond he was shooting over.
"I never saw anything like it before,"
said Dolliver, without cracking a smile;
"the ducks 1 killed froze stiff a second
after they struck the water, and my dog
'Leatherhead' had to scrape the ice from
off the birds' backs with his paws before
he could get a hold on them. Why, in
the early morning it was so cold that the
shot froze into a solid mass after leaving
the gun and some of the birds I killed
were actually cut in two when they fell."
THE ANGLERS.
Arrival of the First Winter Run of
Steelheads In the Creeks.
The late rains have made glad the hearts
of the midwinter anglers. Last Sunday
some very nice steelheads were caught at
Point Reyes, Larkspur and Bbellville.
Hunter, Terry, Walker aud Harmon tried
their luck in the tidewaters of Paper-mill
Creek and all caught fish, with the excep
tion of Walker, who scored a duck egg.
The trout taken were small. McGreggor,
Cooney and Hoffman fished tbe Tamalpais
slough and had pretty good sport. Hoff
man caught three, tbe smallest of which
weighed one and a half pounds..
At Shellvile a number of small ten and
twelve inch fish were caught.
Mr. Morgan of Duncans Mills visited
the City oh Thursday last and reports
that the Russian River is now in splendid
shape and that the local anglers are hav
ing good fun.
John Gallagher, the champion salmon
fisherman of Oakland, is now located at
Duncans and is enjoying good sport. He
sent a telegram to John Butler yesterday
to journey to the happy fishing grounds
as soon as possible with a keg of salmon
"roll," as that was the only bait tne
silversides would recognize. The next
heavy rain will send the big fishes to therr
spawning grounds. It is said that illegal
fishing is practiced near the mouth of the
Russian River. A Deputy Fish Commis
sioner will visit Duncans to-morrow.
THE OARSMEN.
Increased Activity in Rowingr Cir-
cles After the Regatta.
The Thanksgiving day regatta has cre
ated greater interest in rowing than has
been displayed for many months. .
The clubs are gaining in members, and
there is every prospect of a marked re
vival in aquatics.
Tbe Dolphins intend to have a crew en
tered in the junior and senior barge races
at the next regatta. Captain Will Patch
will take tbe following men out for a
practice spin to-morrow. They are Al
Rouard, Tom Kennedy and E. P. Sulli
vau, and they will be under tbe watchful
eye of coach Adam Schuppert.
Keenan is out three times a week in his
boat and is keeping himself in condition
for the next regatta.
The Dolphins' committee on nomina
tion will meet to-night to choose efficers
for next year. The club will give a ladies'
day social on January 10 that will surpass
anything ever attempted by them in that
line.
It is rumored that Len Haussler has
challenged McCausland to a mile and a
half race for a medal. Haussler wants
three weeks to train in and is trying to
borrow Tom Keenan's boat. If the match
is made a lively race is looked for. Mc-
Causland is the present Pacific Coast
champion.
Tiie Alameda Boat Club met last week
and elected the following officers: Presi
dent, J. A. Samson ; vice-president, W. G.
Hansen; secretary, W. B. Hinchman;
treasurer, C. J. Lancaster; captain, A.
Schumacher; lieutenant-captain, At well
C. Webb. Tne club will give a ball early
in January.
The First Division of the Naval Reserve
are dissatisfied with the outcome of the
Thanksgiving day race, and nave chal
lenged the victors to another race, which
will take place in the near future.
One of the morning pjpers accused Mr.
Yale, the gentleman appointed to referee
tbe races at the regatta, witb being at the
football fame when he should have been
at his post It is an unjust charge, as
Mr. Yale was in the country until 4 o'clock
that afternoon.
A great many hard things have been
said as to Chairman Pembroke's course in
the last regatta. He has been charged
with getting up tbe regatta for self-inter
ests, and that the prizes awarded were
purchased by him. It is an improper
charge, as the medals were made by Mr.
Rotnkopf. Mr. Pembroke expended a
great deal of labor in trying to make the
regatta a success, and in doing so neglect
ed his own business to his own loss. His
work was a labor of love, as he had the in
terests of rowing at heart, and not for a
pecuniary gain.
FIELD TRIALS.
Young and O'd Dors That Will Race
Near Bakersfield Next Month.
The all-aged stake for the Pacific Coast
field trials, which will be held near Bakers
field in the near future, closed a few days
ago, but owing to a delay occasioned by
some mistake on the part of some of the
country sportsmen who failed to enter
their charges at the proper time Secretary
Kilgariff concluded not to give the names
of the dogs now in his possession for pub
lication until Monday, when the full list
of entrants will appear in The Call. The
Derby entry will be very large this year,
but the same cannot be said for the old
dogs. However, the ones that will com
pete belong to the aristocratic family of
canines, and will doubtless distinguish
themselves on the quail fields of Kern
County when they are cast off to find
game.

Sacramento Sporting Sens.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Dec. 3.â The coming
contest between William Johnson of the Sacra
mento Athletic Club and Theodore Van Bus
kirk of the San Francisco OlymDic Club is the
cenier of interest to the sport-lovers of this
vicinity. The boxing match will be a ten
round go, and will take place at the clubroom
in this city on the 11th. Both men are hot
favorites witb their respective clubs, and the
boys iv this city will bank heavily on their
favorite, who three years a go won the amateur
chain i ionship ol the State by defeating the
best men that could be brought out iv the
Olympic Club tournament held in San Fran
cisco. Johnson has done nothing in the box
ing line since then, except to put out Austra
lian Billy Smith, the doughty veteran of the
ring, who Sharkey declares gave him the
hardest battle of his life. Johnson will prob
ably weigh in at 170 pounds.
The local game markets are overflowing with
game of all descriptions. Barney Keller has a
record of 300 mallard, made in three days'
shooting this week, and two other men
brought in 150 pair ot birds in a day's shoot.
Stewart Upson and Russ Flint are taking a
week's outing among the quail in the vicinity
of Pilot Hill and are having fine sport. Frank
Newbert, Charles Demerit aud Harry Trump
ler bagged twenty-four quail each during a
day's outing this week. Good sport is being
had at the different club preserves amonp the
ducks and several excellent bags of snipe have
been brought in lately.
Everybody is "going daft" on coursing at the
present time. William Hanlon, the well
known grocery man, picked up what was
supposed to be a scrub dog, and now claims to
possess a world-beater. Charles K. Lipman
has also become possessed of the popular craze.
Next Sunday Hon. Judson Brusie will officiate
at the park as slipper and H. H. Devine, secre
tary of the Coursing Park Association, as judge.
There will be over forty entrants and some
stiff purses offered.
The High School elevens have been practic
ing on the, gridiron and are puttiug up some
good football, with matches in the prospec
tive. The baseball nines of the Sacramento
Athletic Club are also practicing and playing
good ball whenever the weather allows, and
thÂ« handball courts are kept Dusy.
Rutherford.
WAS NEARLY MOBBED.
Joseph Doruato's Cruelty to a Horse
Excites the Indignation of
a Large Crowd.
Joseph Dornato, a teamster, gave an ex
hibition of brutality yesterday afternoon
at Turk and Taylor streets. A large
crowd gathered in a few minutes and
Donato came within an ace of being
moDbed. Shortly after he was meditating
in a cool corner of the City Prison, the
picture of meekness; but then he was a
prisoner, charged witb cruelty to animals,
and hud neither horse nor whip to satisfy
bis passion.
The incident of Dornato's cruelty and
the gathering ol the mob was related by
Officer McMurrie of the Society for the
Proventiqn of Cruelty to Animals.
"I was in my office, which is near where
the fellow was arrested," he said. "Sud
denly several people burst into the room.
They were greatly excited ana asked me
to go with them to the corner of Turk and
Taylor streets and arrest a man for cruelty.
By the time 1 go: there the crowd was
getting ready to mob Dornato. He hÂ£d a
horse and a heavy load of olive oil, which
the horse was barely able to haul, and he
raised weits on the animal's back, each
one as thick as a mac' i linger. Bo I took
him in custody."
JACKSON'S DEFENSE.
Three Witnesses Will Testify on Hia
Behalf To-Day.
In the trial of Arthur Jackson, charged
with the murder of August Florentine,
considerable time was taken up yesterday
with a discussion between attorneys as to
the introduction of certain testimony.
Attorney Carroll Cook, representing the
defense, drew Judge Belcher's attention
to the fact that none of the witnesses in
troduced by the prosecution were in thÂ«
room at the time of tbe shooting of Flor
entine. He said -there was plenty of tes
timony from persons who were in the
rooms bnck of the saloon when tbe tragedy
occurred, but that none of the witnesses
who saw the killing had been called by the
State to tell what tney Knew of the occur
rence.
Deputy District Attorney Hosmer de
clined to call the persons suggested by
Mr. Cook to the witness-stand.
Mr. Cook stated that three men, namely
Cornelius Hurley, Charles Leyden and
William Troy were in the room when the
pistol shot was fired, and saw all that took
place; that at the preliminary examina
tion these men testified that Jackson
acted in self-defense. He thought the
prosecution ought to bring forward all tbe
testimony possible that is material to the
case, whether favorable or unfavorable to
the defendant.
Mr. Hosmer said he was willing to have
the tease go to the jury without calling the
witnesses named by Mr. Cook, so they will
be introduced by the defense at this morn
ing's session of court.
FAIR'S ESTATE.
Interest on Bonds and Kenta Bring in

SMUGGLERS IN COURT,
Alex Pontages and Sam Brown Before
United State* Commissioner
Heacocfc.
Alex Pentages, a fisherman, and Samuel
Brown, charged with having unstamped
opium in their possession, appeared be
fore United States Court Commissioner
Heacock yesterday morning. Chief Cus
toms Inspector Holmes testified that he
arrested Brown and found 144 tins of the
drug upon the person of the prisoner.
George Peters, the proprietor of a eand
wich-stand on the corner of Eddy and
Mason streets, testified that about three
weeks ago, on the corner of Fifth and
Howard streets, Pentages agreed to sell
him 11)0 pounds of opium. The drug was
10 be delivered by Brown at the corner of
Twelfth and Mission streets.
It was in that locality Brown was ar
rested by Holmes, who had been posted
by Peters. It is thought by the customs
officials that Peters is one of the gang, and
exposed his pals, thinking to gain more by
so doing. Pentages was arrested Thurs
day evening by Inspector Holmes in a
saloon on Ellis street, having been de
coyed there by a letter sent him by the
clever officer.
Tiie trial of the accused was set for next
Friday.
LABOR COUNCIL.
Delegates Report Baainess Quietâ Hofie
ihner Hy land Cnder Fire.
At tbe San Francisco Labor Council last
night delegates reported business quiet,
but with a prospect of labor interests
brightening in the near future.
The delegate representing the Coast Sea
men's Union reported that there are now
seventy vessels at anchor at the Oakland
mole waiting for engagements.
A complaint was preferred against
Horseshoer Michael Hyland, whose shop
is on Webb street, charging him with em
ploying non-union men in his line of busi
ness. This grievance was referred to the
executive committee for investigation,

PAIM'S CELERY COMPOUND.
The Best Remedy in the Worldâ
* Makes People Well. V
There is one true specific for diseases
arising from impure blood and a debili-
tated nervous system, and that is Paine'a
celery compound, so generally prescribed
by physicians. It is probably the most
remarkable remedy that the scientific re-
search of this country has produced.
Prof. Edward E. Phelps, M.D., LL.D., of
Dartmouth College, first prescribed what
is now known the world . over ;as Paine
celery compound, a positive cure for dys-
pepsia, biliousness, liver complaint, neu-
ralgia, rheumatism, all nervous diseases
and kidney troubles. For the latter
Paine's celery compound toas succeeded
again and again where everything else
has failed. __ ' â  m

TWO INDICTMENTS
FOR PERJURY
The Grand Jury Listens to
the Story of an Al
leged Robbery.
Mysterious Removal of Livings-
ton Brothers' Sack Con
taining $3300.
A Beef Contractor Is Compelled to
Live Up to the Letter of
His Contract.
Attorney Frank Shay and representa
tives of the Oregon Steel Company and the
Judson Manufacturing Company yester
day submitted statements to the Grand
Jury whicn led, it is stated, to the indict
ment of Meyer- Livingston and Max Liv
ingston for perjury. The jury did not re
port the indictments to the court yes
terday.
Las: July the Livineston brothers con
ducted a junkshop on Fremont street.
Previous to that time they arranged to buy
the iron of the dbniuniled building of The
San Francisco Gas Company on First
street. The iron was to be purchased for
the Judson Manufacturing Company, and
that institution euaranteed tbe Living
stons' account with the gas company to
the amount oi $1800.
According to the story told by witnesses
yesterday the Livingstons sold the iron to
the Oregon Steel Company, the Fulton
Iron Works and other establishments and
collected the money. On the night of May
20, 1896, Meyer Livingston and his wife,
who lived in the bouse witn Air. and Mra.
George Bridgeman, at 314 Fremont street,
went to the theater. On their return at
11 o'clock that night they reported that
during tneir absence from the room which
they occupied some one had entered the
bouse and taken irom umier the pillow of
their bed a bag containing $3300. Mr.
Bridgeman cnrefully examined the win
dows and doors and became convinced
that no one had entered tue house during
the absence of Livingston.
Mr. Bridgeman and ins wife were wit
nesses before tue Grand Jury yesterday,
and it is said completely exploded the
story that a robbery had been committed
at their house.
Shortly after the alleged robbery the
Livingstons filed a petition in insolvency.
They were arrested for perjury in making
false representations- to the court. There
was a hearing in Jud^e Low's police court
and the defendants were released on
habeas corpus.
In the alleged robbery on May 20, the
Livingstons claimed that the sum oi $900
paid to them by the Oregon Steel Com
pany was placed in the bag under the
pillow and was stolen. The Grand Jury
received positive proof that Mr. Knight of
the steel company paici the Levingstona
by a check for $900 on May 23, three days
after the alleged robbery.
Max Livingston, a brother of Meyer,
lives in Oakland witn their mother. Ail
of ihe Livingstons interested, the mother
included, were at 314 Fremont street, in
this City, the night before the alleged
robbery, and were counting money in their
room in Bridgemau's house. Testimony
presented to the Grand Jury creates a
strong suspicion that tne money was taken
to Oakland the nigut before the alleged
robbery.
Members of the Grand Jury were reti
cent in speaking of the testimony, but
the facts disclosed convinced them that
the rankest perjury had been committed.
Auditor Broderick, City and County
Attorney Cresweii. Treasurer Widber, Tax
Collector Block, Chief Deputy Assessor
Herzer, Supervisors Benjamin and Hobbs
of the Finance Committee had a brief con
ference with the Grand Jury yesterday.
The parties to the conference agreed to
meet next Wednesday evening. At tnat
time plans wi.l be considered to reduce
the cost of collecting unsecured personal
properly taxes in San Francisco. The
present system is acknowledged by all to
be cumbersome and expensive. A saving
of $30,000 per annum could be effected by
the adoption of a simple method. The
cost of hiring eight clerks to calculate re
bates on overpaid tax bills is of itself quite
an item.
This year taxes on personal property
unsecured by real estate was collected on
the basis of last year's levy, and now,
since tLia jear'i levy has been fixed at a
lower figure, there is a rebate on each tax
bill. Tne levy had not teen made lor
this year when the taxes became due, so
the Assessor's deputies', followincthe law,
had .o use last year's levy. It is a ques
tion whether the Assessor ought not to be
relieved wholly of the resuonsibiiity of
collecting personal property taxes. The
system may work well in counties of the
interior, but San Francisco seems to pre
fer that the Tax Collector should collect
all the taxes and the Assessor assess all
the property.
The Grand Jury and the members of the
San Francisco delegation to tne Legisla
ture may get together this month and
consider what measures should be advo
cated at Sacramento in order to diminish
the expense and abolish the complication
of colleciing personal property taxes in
this City.
A. E. Drucker, William F. Man and
Richard Pecht, belonging to the Alms
liouse and hospital committee of tUe
Grand Jury, have made several visits to
these institutions. A few days ago the
carcass of an oM cow was sent to the
Almshouse by the contractor. It wa? re
turned by order of the committee and the
contractor was directed to furni3h the
quality of meat called for by the specifica
tions of his contract. Yesterday morning,
as early as 6 o'clock, the contractor seiu
to the Almshouse a load of inferior beef.
Superintendent Reddy advised the com
mittee of the Grand Jury of the fact and
Messrs. Drucker and Mau went out to the
institution and bad the beef rejected.
They report that Captain Rpddy, the
superintendent, is doing his d :ty and
that the contractor now understands that
no more inferior meat will be accepted.
Meat sent to the hospital was also re
turned one day this week. It has been
suggested that the Board oi Health should
have beef inspected and stamped as "ap
proved" before it is delivered to the Alms
house and hospital. It is known that the
llealih Board has an army of high- priced
inspectors and deputies. Members of the
Grand Jury fancy that the board should
do some good with the money drawn from
the taxpayers.
DECIMATE THE BRAVES
More Ircquois Sacrificed on the
Altar of the White
Metal.
John P. Irish Marked for Eicoriation
<-nd Expulsion From the
Club.
Strenuous efforts are being made by the
Iroquois Club to place itself on a strictly
silver basis. It is succeeding, but its
heroic course is rapidly decimating its
membership. Last night two heads went
to the block and two more braves were
given warning of^ their impending fate.
John Heenan, who was charged witn
having voted for Palmer and Buckner,
the Presidential and Vice-Presidential
candidates of the gold wing of the Demo
cratic party, was the first victim to feel
the ax. He hÂ»a asked for an investiga
tion. A committee was appointed at his
request, and its report was submitted last
night. It reported him aa a gola-hued
traitor, and, with little loss of time in de
bate, his name was ordered stricken from
the roll.
When the case of Charles Wesley Reed
came up it was decided to ignore his com
munication, in which he tendered his res
ignation and which also contained his
reasons for withdrawing from the Iroquois
tepees. His reasons were too vigorously
presented, bo it was voted to accept his
resignation and keep the plain-spoken
document from the records of the club.
Ex-Fenator Reade wanted to know if
John P. Irish was an nonorary member of
the club. It he were, he said, he wanted
him expelled, as lie didn't propose to have
any traitors to the Democratic party in the
organization. The secretary was instructed
to look up the honorary membership roll
and ascertain if the name of Irish be
there. If it be, the wigwams of tne Iro
quois will be forever closed to him.
Keade also became curious as to what
George H. Francoenr intended to do.
Francoeur had confessed that he voted
lor Palmer and Buckner and had prom
ised two weeks ago to send in his resigna

WINE PRICES UNSTEADY.
An Attempt to Combat a Cut in the
New Orleans Market.
Trouble is brewing over the maintenance
of the price of wine of this City, as estab
lished for the interests of the producers by
the California \Vine-raakers' Corporation,
consisting of 2UO of the larger producers.
Some of the dealers that have not been
purchasing from the corporation have
been cutting the prices, while the Wine
Association and Lachman & Jacobi and
the members of the corporation have been
endeavoring to maintain the price, with
the result that the outside buyers have
been doing the business in New Orleans to
ihe exclusion of the others. This situation
it is now sought to overcome.
TheCaliforniaWine Association, handling
almost the entire crop controlled by the
corporation, has accordingly decided to
sell in New Orleans at 19 cents a gallon
and at a Jo-s in order to beat the outside
dealers that have secured the market
there by selling at 24 cents. The corpora
tion has been selling to the trade in mil
lion-gallon quantities at 15 cents a sallon,
aud it is estimated that in order to clear
anyininglafterjcosts of cooperage, ageing,
transportation, interest, etc, it would be
necessary to sell at 10 cents a gallou ad
vance in New Orleans.
Last year the corporation handled about
80 per cent of ihe dry wines of the State; â 
tiio year before about 75 per cent The

Explanation.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top neural
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
days; those underneath it. if any. the amount of
, rainfall, of melted snow in inches and huudredths, '
, during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect pom s of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
â¢word "hieh" means hl?h barometric pressure and i
Is usually accompanied by fair weather; "low" '
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded i
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains. I
â¢â¢Lows" usually first appear on the Washington â¢
coast. When the pressure is high in the interior
* and low along the coast, and the Isobars extend
. north and south along: the coast, rain Is probable; '
but when the "low" is inclosed with isobars of
â  marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in he vicinity of Idaho, and
. the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result.

NEW YORK MARKETS.

NEW YORK. N. V-, Dec. 3.-Speculation at
the Stock Exchange continued quiet. As a rule
Higher prices prevailed, and the undertone of the
market was firm from start to finish. London
advices were favorable, and at the start the for
eigner bought moderate amounts of the lnterna
national issues. The firmness of the market was
â¢due partially to rumors that strong interests were
quietly picking up stock preparatory to starting a
Dull campaign early next year. The recent buy
: ing of the high-priced investment issues and the
grangers were credited to this interest. The
easy condition of the money market, and the be
lief that still lower ra.es wfil obtain after the Jan
nary disbursements li ive ben completed, tend to
make recruits fur tne bu is.
The declaration of a dividend of 1 per cent on

CHICAGO MAKKEIS.
CHICAGO, 111., â¢ Dec. s.â Yesterday's closing
' buoyancy in wheat was in contrast with the tone
;ofl he market to-day. With an utter disregard of
; our action shown by Liverpool and with some in
; crease in the Northwestern arrivals (449 cars
arrived, against 654 last Friday and 936 a year
I ago), this market found it impossible to sustain
I prices attained yesterday. . At tne start the trad
ing was at figures but slightly above the "put"
I price, and it was only a few moments until those
' privileges were passed on the decline. Chicago
] received 40 cars ana inspected out 174,562 busheis.
The weakness continued throughout, the lowest
point being reached before the close. Closing
' Liverpool cables gave a net loss of V4@yid tor the
day. Paris was higher and Berlin and .Antwerp
lower. Exports were liberal at 401,364 bushels.
The last half hour witnessed some panicky selling !
and almost an entire lack of demand. Mar wheat
opened from 85i4@8234c, declined to 80% c, clos
ing at 80y8@81c, 2%Â° under yesterday. Esti
mated receipts for to-morrow, 37 cars No. 3 red
spot wheat ranged from 90(592c. closing
about 90c.
CORNâ Declined in price through the sympathy
existing between it and wheat. The loss was not
so great as in the leading market, but it was ac
companied by quite as mucn weakness. . Receipts
were 265 oars, and 112,076 bushels were taken
from store. Exports were liberal at 440.593
bushels. May corn opened from 263/ 8 c to 2e l 4c,
declined to 26i/B<g>26Vic, closing at the insideâ l 4
(a,3/ s c under yesterday. Estimated receipts for to
morrow 340 cars.
OATSâ The depression of the other grains found
reflection in oats. The trade was of a dull and
uninteresting sort and prices were lower. Re-
I ceipts were 222 cars, and 6000 bushels were taken
I from store. .Kx ports were 78.878 bushels. May
j oats closed i/i'ct^'gc lower. Estimatea receipts for
to-morrow 200 cars.

PROVISIONSâ Hogs were on the descending
scale as regards prices this morning. That bad its
natural effect on product, which also declined. The
weakness of grain \vÂ»s likewise a consideration.
At the close January porK was 12 a " lower: Janu

tober, and this is especially important in showing
that : the peculiar disturbance during the ' Presi
dential . campaign, which ; swelled '. failures 838,
-000.000 In August and September, did not prevent
quick ; return to a monthly ? aggregate , scarcely
greater than of May. Defaulted - liabilities for
eleven months have been $198,838,459. against
$148,544,402 last year, the â¢ Increase being only
$14,000,000 outside of tbo->e two months, and this
remaining increase of only 10 percent wat also in
part due to the alarm during the cam: aign. The
decline of failures to about 40 per cent of the Sep
tember aggregate gives strong-r ground for the
confidence so generally expressed.
Ground for confidence is also found in the aban
donment of two of the largest combinations by
which the iron industry has been retarded and the
possibility that two others will be abandoned.
Such a state of things within a month after the
election suggests that these organizations formed
when depressed business failed to support all the
works in existence and not expected to survive a

it present the base price for wire nails is $1 25,
against $2 55 two week* ago, with greater reduc
tion on small bizes because new cards reduced
â¢'extra" charges. ,
Beams are selling at $135, against $166 two
weeks ago, and there are sales of billets' below
the fixed price. The bar combination is still
undersold by steel bars at I.lc, and nothing Is
doing in rails because the meeting shortly to be
held will settle whether any prices shall be fixed
for the next year, ' BeÃsemer pig at Pittsburg is
lower at $11 65 and gray fore*- at $10, but there is
a large demand f â ! vessel plates, botii in foreign
contracts and for the luxes, Several thousand cars
have been ordered and numerous new buildings
and bridges.
Minor metals are a shade stronger. The coke
combination lias changed its method so that con
tracts are openly made below prices recently
ruling and there is some partition of consumers
among the producing interests. Anthracite sells
below the official circular, but better demand is
I expected with revival in manufacturing. Wool
manufactures are waiting, ana while more con
cerns are at work the new demand improves but
little with favorable weather. In the cotton
manufacture there is little change, though goods
are se ling better, but with many added works
pioduction exceeds the demand. '
The market for raw cotton is weak. With over
4,750,000 bates in sight by December 1, when the
crop is usually about half in sight, current esti
mates would leave only 3,500,000 more to come
forward in nine months, and the larger consump
tion in mills does - no' advance : prices. Other
produce markets have been weaker. Wheat rose
to the close last week, but gradually reacted and
broke sharply on Friday, closing 2s/Â»c lower for
the week.
The volume of business shown 'by clearing
house returns was for the past week nearly - 1 per
cent over last year, and for the month of Novem
ber 3 per cent and 11 per cent less than 1892,
the comparison being the best for the Dast five
months.
i- allures for the week have been 379 in the
United Spates against 324 last year, and in Can
ada 55 against 52 last year.

' COALâ A local circular says: â  â * During the week
there have been four ; arrivals from the Coast col
lieries with 8935 tons of Coal aud one from Aus
tralia with 917 tons. This : is the smallest weekly
import recorded for some lime past and will en
able some of our wholesale dealers to reduce a por
tion of their accumulated ' stock. The frosty
weather this ' week has largely increased the fuel
demand, as can be verified by the number of coal- i
(arts visible -on our . streets ! making : deliveries. : <
Business In this line is reported brisk, with a gen- I
eral improvement of values. There Is no change
01 retail pi Ices, but there is a marked advance in
steam grades to lnri;e consumers, with every like
lihood of siill better figures later on. With outward
grain freights at the present low ruling rates we
are assured of relatively high inward Coal freights
from Australia and England. : If the Dingley tariff
bill should be accepted as a temporary expedient
It will advance the present duty on Coal 8c $. ton.
Cable reports specify a scarcity of tonnage both in
the Colonies and England, hence almost prohib
itory rates are demanded, but after our August-
September grain-laden vessels arriv.i at their
destination Coal freights must ease off. There is
a very limited list or vessels loading at English,
Welsh and Scotch ports for. tan Francisco, which
signifies very short stocks of British Coals in
March and April next. â¢ British Columbia and
Washington will be ceiled upon a few months
hence to keep our fuel stock intact; their outlook
for profit in 1897 Is more encouraging than the
outgoing year." â  .:."â

I There is a sorrowful-looking woman of
advanced age in this city who has been for
years looking for a lost relative, presum

she has hinted on many occasions that the
one for whom she seeks is yet alive. For

a.n;d passes in and out, ' attracting
MÂ£t little attention, and never enters into

BERKELEY, Cal.. Dec. ' 4. -A move
ment is under loot at the State University,
to have a regular hour each day set aside
to be known as the "students' hour." The
collegians wish this so that they can have
an opportunity to hold their meetings
â¢ without' cutting into the recitation peri
ods, and bo that they can mingle together
and become more thoroughly acquainted
with one another. It has often been
said that the students at Berkeley lack to
a marked dezree that "college spirit' 1
which should link them together, such as
is displayed at Stanford and at other big
universities where dormitories exist. The
agitators for a "students' hour" declare
that such lack of "spirit" in the popular
sense of the term can be corrected by such
a scheme.

TOOK MONEY WITH HIM.
Some Light on the Mystery of Bruin-
liier'a Disappearance.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Dec. 4.-The absence
of William Brummer from his home, 2315
Alameda avenue, as related exclusively in
this morning's Call, has now taken on the
appearanct of foul play. After he left
home on Tuesday he collected a sewer
assessment of $120 for Thomas White,
which has not yet been turned in. Neither
Mr. White nor any one who kliows Mi.
Brummer has even hinted at dishonesty
on vis part.
"I do not believe that Brummer has
aosconded," said Mr. White this after
noon, "for I have every confidence in his
integrity. He has collected money for me
many times and every cent has been ac
counted for promptly. I shall certainly
give him the benefit of every doubt."
City Engineer Payzer, with whom Mr.
Brummer lias been intimately associated
for nine years, said: "If be is in a hole
there are plenty of his friends to help him
out. He neednot lear to come home on
that account, but I fear he has been
foully dealt with. He was too fond of his
family to stay away long. 1 ' The missing
man was the secretary of Concordia
Stamm, German Red Men, and always
kept his books in first-class condition.
The police do not believe that he has met
with foul play, but will soon turn up.
The Xew Library Rooms.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Dec 4â Actual work
was begun upon the alterations in the
Council chambers for the library this
morning. The partition, setting off a
room 32x32 feet, is the first work to be
done, after which a stair of twenty-four
steps, with three landings, will be erected.
The upper room will be used entirely as a
reading-room. The book shelves will be
placed along the west side of the room
downstairs and originally intended for
thp whole library. The reference depart
ment, while not separate, will be parti
tioned off by a railing on the east side.
The delivery de-k will be in the southeast
corner, on the left of the entrance. Just
to the left of that, in the southwest corner,
will be partitioned off a space, with rail
ings ana curtains, for the ladies' depart
ment. This is the only library that will
have a junior department.
Rev. Dr. Lacy Accepts.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Dec. 4.â Thomas A.
Smith, senior vestryman of Christ's Epis
copal Church of this city, is authority for

gentleman to-day, "and nis final ac
ceptance is in the hands of William Rigby.
In it Mr. Lacy announces that he will

A High Death Rate.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Dec. 4.â The Board
of Health met to-night and received re
ports from its officers. Dr. McLean,
Health Officer, reported twenty-two
deaths. Ten of these were over 50 years
of age. This is a monthly death rate of
1.44 and an annual rate of 17.28 per 1000
inhabitants. This is the greatest number
of deaths known here for years and is con
sidered extraordinary by doctors and un
dertakers alike.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 5, 1896.
DROP A NICKEL;
LIGHT THE GAS
San Leandro's Gas Meters
Will Soon Be Changed
Into Banks.
The Unique Innovation Agree
able to Producer, Consumer
and Burglar.
Street Lamps Will Be Loaded for the
Night and Eurn Till
Mconrise.
Oakland Office Sax Francisco Cali,,)
908 Broadway, Dec. 4. 1
San Leandro is to have the most unique
gas plant on the Pacific Coast. It is a
clever adaptation of the measurement of
light by the principles that govern the
nickel-in-the-slot machine. It is a sale
guard alike to producer and consumer,
and will of necessity be of great service to
the prowling burglar.
Within a few weeks all consumers of gas
in that little town will be supplied with
very interesting meters, the delicate ma
chinery of which is just now being com
pleted in a Fourth-street brass foundry.
The body of the machine is an ordinary
gas meter, but on top is a combination of
cogs, springs, wheels and little devices
very ingeniously fitted together, and
which are guaranteed to measurj perfectly
the consumption of gas. The most pecu
liar feature about the new system is a little
slot into which the consumer places his
coin in proportion to the amount of gas
he wishes to use.
If a householder only has a few cents to
I spare at a time, and wishes to illuminate
; his house with gas, he can put a nickel in i
I the. slot and it will liberate so many feet
!of illuminating power. By a very careful
; measured system, none of the gas is
| wasted, although it may not all be used
| atone time. While the gas is burning,
j the pressure of the vapor through the pipe
| works a spiral rod, and when the mark
| on the rod equal to the value of the coin
j reaches a certain place, the supply is !
! turned off, and unless the slot is patron I
I ized again the house or hall will be in.
I darkness.
Another adjustment prevents any sud
! den going out of the light. It is so ar
! ranged that twenty minutes before the
I value of the coin is burned up, the light
I commences to fiiCEer, perform all kind of I
j contortions and gradually grows dim, thus I
I giving the consumer the option of putting I
another nickel in the slot or of lighting a
candle.
These meters will be supplied to houses
and public halls and also, it is said, to the
municipality. In tbis latter case it will
become the duty of the Town Treasurer
every evening before leaving his office to
place enough money in the slot to guaran
tee the town from darkness during the
night. He will also have to work out
some very careful problems in proportion,
as the amount of cents placed in the slot
must correspond accurately to the length j
of hours before the moon will r^e, or
theba will be a serious waste of gas. "This i
system will work no injury to anvbociy," |
said the inventor to-day, as he was !
making hia final mechanical adjustment.
If anybody does not like the amount of
\ gas they get for two bits they need not
i put any more money into it. lv public
i halls and stores where therA is a possi-
I bility of many people using uit proprie
j tor's gas and swelling his bill unknown to
him this new system will prove a grea,^
advantage, for unless such trespassers
patronize the slot part of the machine
they will net no light.
A complication is likely to arise in re
gard to the town lighting, and it is not yet
decided whether a meter shall be attached
to each lamppost and the Town Marshal
be sent around each evening at sundown
to put the necessary nickels in each ma
chine. If such plan be followed there is
I no doubt that the meters will become very
attractive to the small boys and a constant
discrepancy would bo found between the
amount of gas used and the nickels found
jin the receiver. There can be no doubt
I that after a machine had been in use some
I months it would possess a marked magne
: :ism for a burglar, and a new branch of
crime will undoubtedly come into vogue
in San I.eandro within tne next few
months. It will probably be safer to crack
half adozen nickel-in-the-slot gas-measur
ing machines than to tackle one safe, and
the returns will probably be greater. San
Leandro's Town Marshal is considering
the advisability of issuing a notice that he
wil/ not be responsible for gas-meters in
the fntnre. i _^.^
GRIM RESIGNS.
Result of the Consolidation of F. M.
Smith* Many Interests.
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. 4.âSuperintend
ent A. K. Grim of F. M. Smith's Berkeley
electric road has posted a bulletin at the
power-house which reads: "After the
first of the year my connection with this
road as manager will cease." The resig
nation of Mr. Grim was read with great
regret by the numerous employes of the
road, as he had been regarded a* a friend
by them during the four years that they
have been under his control. The change
is tbe result of the transfer of the line to
the Realty Syndicate, which embraces all
the many properties of F. M. Smith and
associate?. The head office of the syndicate
is located in San Francisco, and from there
the system will be operated at a greater
reduction of expense* than that incurred
by running each of its properties inde
pendently.
WAYMIRE IS INDORSED.
Army and Navy Veterans Want Him in
the Cabinet.
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. 4.â The Army
and Navy Republican League met last
night, and after transacting some routine
business resolutions were adopted unani
mously indorsing Judgo Waymire lor a
position in President McKinley's Cabinet.
Bimilar resolutions were passed favoring
the appointment of National Commander
Lawlor as Pension Commissioner.
Wants Salary and Prestige.
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. 4 â J. H. Clark,
at present in charge oi a school district in
Pitlcin County, Colo., has sent the follow
ing note to the school board. After ap
plying for the position of School Superin
tendent he said: "My reasons for desiring
a change are that I may obtain a position
of greater prestige where I can have
greater responsibility. I also wish a
greater salary, Dut tbat is a secondary
considerauoufor the present." As Super
intendent McClyroond's term expires next
March the letter has caused him much
uneasiness.
Another Damage Case.
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. 4 âThe case of
L. Murdock against the Haywards Elec
tric road for $20,000 for aiteged injuries
said to liave been received while acting as
conductor in the company's employ com
menced to-day.
W. H. Chickerinjr and Bam Bell McKee
appear to represent the company, while
M. C. Chapman and Tom Bradley appear
for Murdock.
Ki-toroner Kvew Summoned.
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. 4. â A summons
waa served this morning on ex- Coroner
Henry Evers, requiring him to turn into
the County Treasury certain fees for the
handling of dead bodies, which it was
claimed by the last Grand Jury were
illegal. Mr. Evers clairas that in collect
ing these fees he followed precedents and
is sustained by a reasonable construction
of tue law.
Herd el Was an An arch Ut.
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. 4.â lt was dis
covered to-day that Frederick Herde!,
the man who committed suicide on the
steps of the Hall of Records yesterday,
was a German anarchist. A few minutes
before the shooting Herdel met James
Stanley, ex-Public Administrator, ana
had a talk with him. He said that as he
had lost all his property in Alameda
Connty lie intended to leave his body
here. Stanley treated the matter as a
joke, but a few minutes later Herdel was
dead. He has fisured in many very un
pleasant incidents in this county, and it
was only by accident that he escaped trial
for the alleged murder of his wife in a
reservoir at Mission San Jose.
Does Not Want a Theater.
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. 4.â George W.
McNear positively denies that he is
in any way interested in any prospec
tive hotel and theater building in this
city. He says there is no foundation for
the story that he and VV. M. Watson
were interested in such a scheme, as he
has not seen Watson for fifteen years.
May Be a New Clnb.
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. 4.â The Young
Men's Republican Club held an excited
session to-night and finally, with the as
sistance of the Pondinkys and Coot clubs,
j. W. Sietson was elected president. The
Pulcifer people were beaten and the result
will probably be the organization of an
other young men's club.
SUCCESSFUL CONCERT.
That Given by Members of the Church
of the Immaculate Conception.
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. 4.â To the
League of the Cross Cadets of the Cnurch
of the Immaculate Conception belongs
the honor of overcrowding the handsome
new Reed Music Hall. The concert ten
dered them for the purpose of properly
equipping the league could not have been
more successful, and the committee on
arrangements, consisting of A. i>\ Griffin,
chairman; F. F. Caire. treasurer; J. J.
Rigney, secretary; D. J. Hallahan, J. D.

In three of the five events decided at
Ineleside yesterday one certain entry so far
outclassed the other starters that scratches
educe i the fields to a minimum. \s long
as stake horses are allowed to start in sell
ing races, entered for a mere song, this
w:ll continue to be the case. Of the six
events run, first choices were successiul on
four occasions. The attendance was good
and the betting heavy.
Pat Dunne's good stake colt Captive
made his first appearance here in the mile
and a furlong run. All of the other eu
tries with the exception of Ostier Joe and
Fred Gardner drew out, and the big chest
nut was a 1 to 2 choice, which looked a
long price. He made all the running
with Oitler Joe at his head most of the
way, and won by a head in 1:56 with
pounds to spare.

Won galloping. Winner, W. M. Murray's b. g., by imp. Layallah Spray. Time, 1:01%,
made a 3 to 1 favorite for the five-furlone
two-year-old scramble that headed the
card, on the strength of some reported fast
work. H. Martin managed to find a
pocket with her, and she finished Deyond
the money. The Texas colt Roltaire, with
6to 1 about him in the ring, led all the
way, winning easily from Torpedo.
Starling at 9 to 20 in the betting ring,
Salvable waited on Walter J to the stretch
and then cakewalked in, leading the latter
horse out by two lengths. Gratify was a
fair third.
The six-furlone sprint, with but five
starters, furnished an opportunity for
Beiliioso to annex another purse. The
ring held him at 3 to 10, and he romped in
ahead of McLight. Lobengula was a good
third.
There was some element of real specu
lation enthused in the bettinc on the fifth
race, a six-furlong pursp event. Mr. Mac
donough's handsome fill y, imp. Santa
89110, opened in the books at 9to 5, but
there was such a stiff play on Good Times
that 11 to 5 was obtainable around poÃt
time. The latter colt might have brought
the coin home but. lor Gardner's foolish
policy of racing out in front to the stretch
with the rapid-eoing Fly. In the run to
the wire Good Times tired perceptibly, al
lowing Santa Bella to come on and win
by a length in 1:15 flat.
Tbe wise one* tiaured that five furlones
ju-t suited Scotch Rose and she was
u<Â»avily played to win the final nve-furlone
jaunt at odds of 8 to 5. She led to the
stretch, where Dunboy passed her and
skipped in an easy winner by a length in
1:01^- . â 
Notes-
This afternoon the first of the bier stakes
will be run at Ingleside. The one down
for decision is the G. H. Mumm &
Co., for three-year-olds, valued at $1300.
Casper, True Blue, Howard S, Candelaria
and all the crack two-year-olds will face
the barrier.
Messrs. Short and Davis, owners of the
mare Sally Sensible, together with Jockey
Skeets Martin, were suspended by the
judges yesterday for the peculiar showing
made by the filly, who was favorite for
the opening event. Sally has be,en going
great guns in her work and in tbe opinion
of the officials in the stand she was "filled
up" in order to exonerate Tommy Butler,
who is now on the ground for a ride
astride th* daughter of Salrator that did
not suit tbe stand.

JURY IN THE WILLIAMS CASE
LOCKEO UP FOR THE NIGHT
Damaging Testimony Introduced Against Judge Heb
bard by Chief Justice Beatty and Justice Van
Fleet of the Supreme Court
Flatly Contradicted His StateJ
ment Made Under Oath the
Day Before.
COULD NOT HAVE SO ADVISED.
Arguments by Attorneys Thornton
and Henley on the History of
Judicial Oppression.
Tbe jury in the Williams libel case was
called in at 7 and 11 p. m. yesterday, and
on both occasions reporting a failure to
agree was by order of Judge Daingerneld
ordered locked up for the night.
The stroke of grace in tne proceedings
was administered yesterday by Cnief Jus
tice Beatty of the Supreme Court and
Justice Van Fleet of the same judicial de
partment, when they took the stand and
flatly contradicted the testimony of Judge
Hehbard on a very important point.
It will be remembered that Judge Heb
bnrd testified that before he appointed
General Sheehan as receiver of the bank
he called upon Justice Beatty and con
sulted him on the p int of his not intend
ing to commit a contempt of court; that
Justice Beatty said "We know what you
are doing; that's all right; go ahead," or
words to that effect.
Justice Beatty declared on the stand
yesterday that he would not and could
not have used the language attributed to
him. His testimony was corroborated by
that of Justice Van Fleet
It was conceded that the prosecution
bad made out a very weak case, taking ail
the circumstances into consideration.
Thomas S. Williams Jr., the defendant,
was called to the stand bright and early
in the morning.
"Mr. Williams," asked Mr. Henley,
"did you in the presence of Mr. Bartnett,
in Judge Hebbard's chambers, have a
conversation with Jud^e Hebbard in
which the Judge said to you, 'I have one
favor to ask of you, and that is that you
go among your people and tell them the
truth,' and that you said that you wouid
do so?"
"No, sir; nothing of that kind was
said."
"Did he say that at any time or at any
place?"
"Never, sir."
The witness was handed over to Mr.
Kahn for cross-examination.
"Do you know who paid for those cir
culars?"
The objection to the question was sus
tained.
This closed the evidence, with the ex
ception of that of Justices Beatty and
Van Vliet, and Mr. Kahn requested the
court to limit the argument to two hours
on each side. The request was resisted by
Henley and Thornton for the defense,
they arguing that to limit the time would
have a tendency to break up a coherent
argument.
Chief Justice Beatty of the Supreme
Court came inio the courtroom during the
discussion and was called to the stand as
a witness for the defense in rebuttal.
After the u-ual preliminary questions,
Mr. Henley asked:
"Justice Beatty, there has been some
testimony here with regard to an alleged
interview between yourself and Judge
Hebbard on a certain occasion, while
some of that litigation that grew out of
â the failure of the People's Home Savings
' Bank was pending in the Supreme Court,
and the following language was alleged to
have been used: Judge Hebbard said:
'Justice Beatty, I have come here to fix it
so that I could not be punished for con
tempt of court.' Judge Beatty said:
'Judge Hebbard, we know what you are
doing; it's all right; go ahead; you'll not
be in contempt,' or sometning of that
kind."
Then Mr. Henley added: "Judge Heb
bard testified: 'Of course. I don't pretend
to say that Justice Beatty told me to go
on and appoint a receiver; I don't intend
to be understood as saying that. I wanted
him to understand that whatever I did in
tne court below I did it with the inten
tion ot not committing any contempt of
. the Supreme Court.' "
The witness replied: "Well, Mr. Hen
â  ley, the, only answer 1 can make to that is
that I don't remember having used any
â¢ Buch laneuage which would convey the
impression that would seem to
convey. When my attention was called
by you to this matter some weeks aeo,
with reference to Judge Hebbard's card in
the newspapers with relation to that sub
ject, I nad so completely forgotton having
ever seen Judge Hebbard on that occasion
that I could not recall it. I afterward
spoke to Justice Van Vliet about it, and
he recalled some matters which revived a
very bazy recollection of the interview. I
could remember about tnis much: That
Judge Hebbard did come there and say
something about not wanting to act in
any manner that would be deemed a con
tempt of court, but what was said I could
not begin to recollect. He there wished to
disclaim any intention of committing con
tempt, any to inquire whether >n acting in
a distinct proceeding it would be deemed
contempt of court."
Mr. Henley asked (again: "Do you
think it possible that you could ever have
advised Judge Hebbard that you knew
* what he was doing, and to go ahead?"
"I don't know," replied Justice Beatty,
"how I should have known what he was
doing. I certainly would not have taken
a newspaper report as the basis for giving
my advice to any one. I certainly could
not have given him any advice."
"vVas it possible that you would have
told him in advance of what your judicial
' action would be in a matter coming before
you in the course of your judicial investi
gations?"
There wt>s an objection to the question,
and Mr. Henley said: "I understand that
when Judge Hebbard published in the
newspapers a- card purporting to give the
details of tfc' interview with Justice
Beatty, he intended to have the people of
this City understand that he had con
sulted Justice Beatty in regard to ihe ap
pointment of a receiver, and that Justice
Beatty advised him to go on and appoint
. â¢ a receiver."
The next question put to Justice Beatty
was: "Did you ever say. Judge, 'we know
what you are doing; it is all ri^nt; go
ahead, or language tantamount to that?"
"I don't think that I used language
which would convey the impression that
that seemed to convey. On the contrary,
I never intended to do anything of that
kind."
Justice Van Vliet of the Supreme Court
was '.he next witness, and was asked by
Mr. Thornton with reference to the inter
view between Chief Justice Beatty and
Judge Hebbard. He replied that on one oc
casion he went into Justice Beatty's cham
bers and found the Justice and Judge
Hebbard there. Either Justice Beatty or
Hebbard suggested that Judge Hebbard,
had come tuore in order to convey on his
part the assurance that he wished to avoid
any app arance of doing anything con
temptuous toward the court in the matter
of this litigation. That was all that re
mained on the mind of the witness as to
what took place on that occasion. Justice
Van Vliet added:
"I thin* it was Judge Hebbard who
said pleasantly: 'I have just been telling
the Chief that I don't want to get into
contempt in this court in this bank liti
gation.' "
"Did you ever hear Justice Beatty say,
'Judge, we know what you are doing.
It is all r ght' ; or 'go ahead,' or language
to that substance?" was asked.
"I have no recollec.ion which would
enable me to state definitely whether I
did or did not hear such suggestion. My
impression is that 1 heard nothing of that
kind. If Justice Beatty had delivered
any instruction or direction to Judge Heb
bard I would in all probability have re
membered it." *
The court limited the argument to two
hours on each side, and on the opening of
the afternoon session Julius Kahn began
the argument on behalf of the prosecution
by informing the jury that this was not a
prosecution on behalf of Judge Hebbard
but that it was a proceeding on behalf of
the people of the State of California. He
contended that it was libelous to publish
of a Judge that he was unfair, and aston
ished the courtroom by remarking that
the defense had not been able to furnish a
scintilla of evidence to substantiate that
charge.
The speaker then reviewed the evidence
for the prosecution, and laid particular
stress on the fact that Attorney-General
Hart had named a man to Judge Hebbard
to act as receiver, thus tending to sbow
that the Attorney-General did not con
sider that such an appointment would be
illegal. The speaker alleged that one of
the first acts of the new board of directors
of the bank was to scale a $5000 mortgage
down to $3000, in order that tney could
get the money into the bank so as to pay
themselves their salaries.
Much bad been made of the fact, added
the counsel, that Judge Hebbard had ap
pointed General Sbeehan as receiver in all
those cases. What else could he have
done? asked Mr. Kabn. He had to ap
point the same person as receiver in all
the cases in order to keep the funds of the
bank intact.
The speaker argued that Judge Hebbard
had done all that he could to secure the
depositors a representation on the board
of directors and to have the defendant,
Williams, appointed on the board, and in
return, Williams had been guilty of the
basest ingratitude. General Sheehan stiil
held the position of secretary and mana
ger of the bank, and if be were an incom
petent or unlit man for that position
would any one believe that he would still
retain that position? asked Mr. Kahn.
The alleged notorious reputation of
James Aiva Watt was touched upon by
the speaker, who said that the defense had
utterly failed to prove that Mr. Watt's
reputation was of that undesirable qual
ity.
Mr. Thornton followed on behalf of the
defense. He began by saying that during
the forty-four yeÂ»rs of the existence of the
State of ' California, and during all the
elections that had been held during
that time the press had existed, and can
didates had been freely criticized on the
stump and in the press, and oftentimes
those criticisms were couched in language
neither chaste nor dignified. Yet this was
the first time in the history of the State of
California that a candidate bad brought a
suit for libel against any one who had criti
cized him during thecampaign. Candidates
had been content to allow the voice and
vote of the public to settle the question of
their reputation.
The prosecution had contended that the
defendant had committed a libel on a
Judge in office, wnereas such was not the
fact. It was for the jury to determine
whether the citizens of the State of Cali
fornia nad the same right to criticize their
officials and candidates for office as had
the citizens of other civilized nations or
whether they were to be deprived of the
right of saying during a campaign that
such and such a candidate was an unfit
person to hold the office for which he was
seeking.
In the whole course of his political read
ing the speaker bad never read a milder
criticism of a candidate than was con
tamed in the circular alleged to be libel
ous in this case. The law stated, ne con
ceded, that a man in office should not be
defamed with impunity, but when a man
was a candidate for office the people bad
a right to criticize bis fitness for the office
to which he aspired. Citizens had a right
to discuss the fi ness of men in office as
well as those running for office.
How long ago is it, he asked, since the
platforms of two great political parties
attacked the Supreme Court of the United
States and when this attack was repeated
from every platform in the country? The
defamatory remarks and published state
ments reflecting upon the character of
President Cleveland, General Grant and of
other candidates for the highest offices in
the sift of the people were alluded to by
the speaker, who ar ued that should the
candidates who were thus attacked prose
cute the persons for libel who had made
those statements they would not obtain
any redress.
Whenever juries would bring in a ver
dict of guilty in such cases, then would
the right of free speech be limited as it
had never been limited before.
Mr. Thornton took up the circular and
commented upon the first sentence to the
effect that Judge Hebbard was an unfair
and unfit person to be elected to the office
of Superior Judge. He argued that voters
had a right to say that of any candidate
whether the same were true or not, other
wise there would be an end to freedom of
speech and of the press.
With reference to the statement in the
circular that Judge Hebbard had issued
an injunction prohibiting the directors
from meeting, Mr. Thornton said that the
Supreme Court of California had decided
that there was no law authorizing the
Judge to issue such an injunction. Of all
the wrongs that can be committed against
a people, a wrong by a judge acting in a
judicial character is the gravest wrong of
all.
"Can you pretend to believe," he as&ed,
"that a judge should arrogate to himself
powers that never did exist and that nev r
could exist?" It was a wrong committed
against Dick McDonald in jail, but the
speaker was of the opinion that the differ
ence in some respects between the scoun
drel in the jail and the fudge on the bench
was not to nis mind at all palpable.
In ninety- nine out of every hundred
cases of judicial condemnation it has been
found that oppression has selected the
weak and the poor aiid the lowly.
"In this case," proceeded the counsel,
"judicial oppression selected Dick McDon
ald, and even Dick McDonald has rights
before the law that should be renpected.
What rights had those other men, four of
whom were dismissed from the bar of the
criminal court without one shadow of a
stain against theircharacter? Why should
any injunction hay* been issued against
those men without warrant of law? What
bad they done? What had Mr. Graves
done who had been in office only sixteen
days? Where was the law that authorized
the injunction? Is it found in any books?
No; but the law is found in many books
that Judge Hebbard had no rignt to issue
that injunction."
The counsel proceeded to read from the
Supreme Court decision in volume 103 of
the California Reports, wherein the court
decided that the appointment of a receiver
for a savings bank was illegal and void.
\ et, in spite of his knowledge of this
decision Judge Hebbard had appointed
his triend Sheehan as receiver of the bank.
The next point commented upon un
i
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 5, 1896.
favorably was the bringing of tne suit by
Knight and tne appointment of Sheehan
by Hebbard in that case while the ques
tion of the validity of Sheehan's receiver
ship in the first case was pending in the
Supreme Court.
"Anybody," said the counsel, "would
have thought that the litigants could have
waitea until the Supreme Court had de
cided and settled that question."
The attempt of James Aiva Watt, while
acting as attorney for the receiver, to nave
himself made tne attorney for the bank
also was severely commented nnon.
In referring to the alleged failure of
General Sheehan to make a proper ac
counting of his receipts and expenditures
Mr. Thornton -aid:
"They go through the dreary and dis
mal farce of the board of directors which
had appointed General Sbeehan secretary
and manager of the bank, passing a reso
lution that Sheehan had satisfactorily ac
counted to the bank, while Mr. Watt,
attorney for the bank, agrees tuat that is
sufficient, and the same Mr. Watt, attor
ney for Receiver Sheehan, agrees that
that is sufficient. From that day to this
it has never been judicially determined
whether Sheehan has returned the funds of
which he came into possession. There
has never been filed a proper receipt for
moneys received and disbursed by him.
It is "incontestible that Judge Hebbard
allowed to be performed before him the
farce of a legal proceeding in which the
attorney on both sides was one and the
same person.
"Have these men no right," he asked,
"to lay the facts before the public with
such comments as they feel justified? I
say that even if they erred there is a ques
tion above and beyond and apart from all
attacks on a private character, and that is
whether a litigant shall be denied access
to the press, or to printed matter, or to the
stump, for the purpose of invoking the
judgment of his fellow-citizens upon the
treatment he has received at the hands
of a Judge?"
Mr. Henley followed and began by read
ing from an opinion of Lord Chief Justice
Fitzgerald, who advised the jury in the
case quoted that they should be very
broad and liberal in their treatment of the
matter, because the principle of the lib
erty of speech and of the press was most
valuable and should not be trammeled
without grave charge.
The speaker commented upon the fact
that the prosecution had not called as a
witness ex-Attorney-General Hart, who
was present on the occasion when Judge
Hebbard promised to allow the directors
to meet and resign.
Mr. Henley remarked that more than
10,000 depositors had suffered by reason of
the failure of t c hank; many of them
had lost their all, and had been brought
to the verge of absolute destitution. Con
sidering all the circumstances the de
positors had acted very temperately, and
the circular was an unusually mild docu
ment.
The speaker contended that Judge Heb
bard knew that he was doing wrong when
he appointed Sheehan as a receiver, be
cause only a short time before that the
Supreme Court had reversed him on tint
very same point and had decided that the
appointment of a receiver was illegal and
void.
With regard to the payment of $2500 to
Delmas & Shortridge the speaker said
that what had been done bad been done
under a valid contract with the board of
directors by which they were to receive a
retainer for six months in advance. Delmas
& Shortridge were ready and willing and
able to render those services, but they
were dismissed, and an attorney, James
Aiva Watt, employed, "so that those
miserable unfortunate depositors had to
pay for another attorney in addition to
those who had been paid. That was not
honorable, economical management by
the officers of the bank."
Upon the subject of the notoriety of
James Aiva Watt, Mr. Henley said that
the man who could be made the subject of
the animadversions of hundreds of people
in different halls in this City could not
very well escape the name of being a
notorious person.
General Sheehan's mode of making his
livelihood was not taken up.
"General Sheehan has no occupation,"
said Mr. Henley. "He is designated here
as a political parasite. He has been a poli
tician and . has been the recipient of
bounty from his party in the shape of
various offices. He has been holding the
positions of Bank Commissioner, Land
Register of the United States, Secretary of
the Yosemite Valley Commission, Adju
tant-General of the State, and so on. Tno
term "parasite" is figurative. If from
this testimony it can be gathered that
General Sheehan derived his sustenance
from public favor, it may be said that he
subsisted on the body politic, and to that
extent he may be called a political para
site.
"If John F. Sheehan doesn't come
within the terms of that definition, ac
cording to his own testimony, I don't
know who could."
In conclusion the speaker said that a
conviction in this case would strike a
deatb-blow at the liberty of the press and
at the perpetuity of the republican system
of government.
Mr. Foote closed for the prosecution, de
manding a verdict of conviction on the
ground that the circular was libelous and
that its statements had not been substan
tiated. His effort was very crude and

HER HUSBAND
A MONTE CRISTO
A. G. Phillips Makes Mil
> lions After Deserting
His Family.
The Wife Got a Divorce, but It
Was Unlawful and She
. : Claims Him Now.
' Jiidge Seawell's Order Makes a Poor
Woman the Wife of a Rich
African Gold Miner.
â¢ By the simple making of a motion in
Judge Seawell's department of the Superior
Court yesterday Attorney P. J. Mogan
blocked the game of millionaire A. G.
.Phillips, who has been trying for some
months to have a decree of divorce en
tered against him on a judgment rendered
during his absence in Africa several years
ago.
The simple proceedings, however, recall
a husband's desertion of wife and chil
dren, and mark the first step in one of the
most unique legal battles ever waged in
â  the courts by reason of the matrimonial
status. Reduced to its simplest elements,
the story, which will soon be fully nar
rated in the courts, is as follows:
A. G. Phillips, who was a poor man at
the time be deserted his wife and children
, some years ago, is now very wealthy. He
lives In Wisconsin, having made a vast
fortune in African gold mines. It is
rumored tbat he wants to marry again,
but it has been discovered that the divorce
which his wife obtained from him for de
sertion is not valid, tbe decree never having
been entered as required by law. Mrs.
Phillips, who has for years believed her
self to be divorced, now finds herself tbe
lawful wife of the husband who aban
doned her and his children. As she lives
a very humble life and as she has strug
gled for many years to bring up her chil
dren she is naturally loth to surrender
her position as tbe lawful wife of a modern
Monte Cristo. She, therefore, stands
brmly in the position that if her truant
husband wants his freedom he must pay
for it a sum becoming to his rank and
station in life.
Mrs. Phillips seemts to have decidedly
the long end of the fight and her obstinate
refusal to surrender her hold has caused
her husband great uneasiness. He has
hired Attorney W. H. Hart and others to
intercede in his behalf and Judge Sea well
has issued a temporary stay of pro
ceedings.
"The facts of the marriage and divorce
proceedings, that may yet play an im
portant part in the courts and seriously
interfere with Phillips' untrammeled en
joyment of millions, are as follows: .
A. G. Phillips married his wife, Eva L.,
in Western Utah twenty years ago. He
was a struggling young civil engineer
and, failing in Utah, he moved to Virginia
City, then to San Francisco ten years ago.
A son, now 18, and two daughters were
horn to the couple. They are all living
now.
Phillips did not remain here long, but

took a sudden notion to abandon his
family, leaving them almost penniless.
In 1892 Mrs. Phillips brought a suit here
for divorce, on the ground of desertion
and failure to provide. Her attorney was
one E. L. Jenkins, whose name never ap
peared in the directory here and who can
not now be found.
In due time after filing of the suit it was
heard, and Judge Seaweil granted the di
vorce as prayed for.
Attorney Jenkins, however, filed no
findings and the Judge signed no decree.
It transpires that, under the laws of Cali
fornia, when judgments are not entered
within six months the court is directed to
dismiss . all proceedings. Mrs. Phillips,
however, having paid her attorney, be
lieved she was lawfully divorced, and but
recently discovered that she was not.
The deserted woman, having wondered
for years what had become of her chil
dren's father, was greatly surprised a few
weeks apo to get a letter from her old
home in Wisconsin, stating that her hus
band was back, and giving details of his
great prosperity. She investigated and
found that he has made many millions in
the mines of Africa in the past ten years
and that he recently sola bis interest to
a British syndicate for several millions.
He has been spending his money lavishly
since his return.
On consulting Attorney P. J. Mogan
tbe lady learned of the attorney's error
that makes her the lawful wife of the
African millionaire. His attorneys have
pleaded with the court to affirm the de
cree of divorces but this has been without
success. Judge Seaweil at first vacated the
whole proceedings and has now simply
entered a temporary stay of proceedings.
If Mrs. Phillips gets a divorce now she
will ask for such alimony as she finds her
husband is able to way. As he is undoubt
edly worth several millions and is said to
be exceedingly anxious to marry again it
is probable that the little woman who has
been struggling against poverty to rear
and educate the children of the man who
deserted them will get judgment for a sum
that will make her and the children com
fortable and happy for life.
The case will come up again in a few
days, and it is probable, so attorneys say,
that there will be a compromise that will
pay the woman handsomely. If Phillips
wants his freedom, it is said, since he has
no cause for divorce he will have to let
the wife begin a new suit, and this she can
do on her own terms.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 5, 1896.
LUSHED TO THE
VERGE OF DEATH
George L. Fischer of This
City Brutally Treated
at Corinto.
Chilean Passengers of the San
Jose Taken Off and
Beaten.
They Are Beaten With Whips Till
They Almost Yielded Their
Last Breath.
George L. Fischer, agent of Coburn,
Tevis A Co., was a passenger from Co
rinto, Nicaragua, on the San Juan, which
arrived here a day or two ago. He says
Americans and citizens of most other
countries except Great Britain and Ger
many are badly treated in Central
America.
When the San Juan was near Corinto,
off Arenas, Costa Rica, a Spanish drum
mer for a liquor-house claimed he had
been robbed of about Â£100 in American
gold which he had left on a chair in his
stateroom. That was thirty miles from
land and on the high seas. Tbe Spaniard
lost no time in reporting the matter at
Corinto, and when Fischer went ashore
again he was seized by six Nicaraguan
soldiers, whose captain demanded nis
identity and began to abuse and threaten
Fischer, despite the fact that he told him
he was an American citizen and innocent
of any wrong.
"I had $175 in American money on me,"
said Fischer. "It was utterly useless for
me to argue, but I thought I would make
a stand, which proved to work all right.
A crowd just then pushed on shore from
tbe steamer and in tbe crush I managed
to escape and made my way to the Com
andante, inquiring indignantly into tbe
treatment received. He met me with a
haughty air.
" "Did you not escape?' said he. 'That
is enough. Even as your friend it is
almost my duty to have you turned over
to the soldiers again.'
"The police-boat went out to the San
Juan that night and took off one Chilean
and two San Saivattoran passengers. The
San Juan was flying the American flag.
The men were searched, but no American
money was found on them. Shortly after
a native woman appeared before the Com
andante with $35 in American gold, stat
ing that a passenger on the steamer lying
in the harbor had slipped it to her to give
to the Comandante fearing that if it
should be found on his person he would
be suspected of the robbery. She was
asked to point out tbe man and her finger
rested on the Chilean. He protested that
he was a hard-working man and had
earned the money in Panama. But he was
stripped across the loins and as far down
as the knees and placed on a rack or bench
face downward, with hia legs spread apart.
A bundle of long lashes of some kind of
wood of whalebone tenacity was brought
and six soldiers, commanded by a captain,
took their places beside him.
"At the sound of a bugle and the word
from tbe captain one of the soldiers took
up one of the flails, and with measured
beat to the time of the bugle, threw it over
his head and brought it down with awful
effect on the body of the man. He did
this ten times, when, after tbe expiration
of a quarter of a minute, another soldier
stepped forward and repeated the opera
tion. The cries of the victim were some
thing heartrending to hear as lash suc
ceeded lash, each cutting into the flesh
like a knife. Two hundred and sixty of
these were administered, and still the man
could not tell where the money was. He
begged and begged for mercy, but the
soldiers were brutal soldiers, who tried to
make every lash as painful as possible.
The man was finally taken off the bench
to give him time to recover for another
lashing. He was a literal mass of raw
meatwnere tbe lashes had descended upon
him, and he had to be carried away and
set down on his hands and knees like a
figure of wood. The two Salvadorans
meanwhile were imprisoned, and it was
thought best to try tbe lash on them. One
of the men was put on the bench and
given sixty lashes, and he could tell
nothing about the stolen money and was
taken off and the third man put on. The
beating administered to him was beyond
description."
Fischer says he rould stand it no longer.
He appealed to the Comandante, but he
was told that he had better keep his hands
oft" Nicaraguan affairs. After a hundred
lashes had been plied on the Salvadoran
he finally "confessed" that he would tell
where the money was. He was taken from
the rack and brought upstairs, where he
pleaded with the brutes that he did not
know anything about it and tbat be had
confessed simply to get time to recover, as
they were killing him. He was brought
down and again fifty lashes were laLd
upon his quivering and bleeding flesh.
Brought upstairs again he fainted away,
and when Fischer interceded to be al
lowed to get the man water the captain
told him that "dirty" Americans should
keep out of Nicaraguan affairs or they
might eet the same treatment. After
much pleading on the part of Fischer the
suffering victim was brought a glass of
water.
"I could not believe my eyes," said
Fischer, "when I beheld the brutal sol
diera talte tne Chilean and place him on
the rack again. I saw them give him fifty
more lashes on his raw flesh and I left,
sickened at the sight. The next time I
saw hini he was being brought on board
the steamer by the soldiers with a docu
ment from the Comandante to the effect
that the man had been proven innocent
and honorable. They then started to
take up a collection on board to pay the
Chilean for his torture. They came to me
and wanted $50."
HEIR TO A FORTUNE.
S. Baldacci Bound to His Old Home in
Italy to Pick Up a l-argo
Windfall.
S. Baldacci, an old resident of Gilroy
and owner of a half interest in a general
store thore, was among the arrivals at the
New Western Hotel yesterday. He is on
his way to Italy to file his papers for a
large fortune which has been left him by
an uncle who has lately died.
Mr. Baldacci was in Italy on a visit last
year. He is quite well-to-do, but the
windfall of the fortune in his native land
will put him in far better shape. It is
said the bequest will be upward of $100,000.
Mr. Baldacci, when he was apprised that
the estate had been bequeathed to him,
endeavored to get the matter adjusted
through the Italian Consul. He was told,
however, that this could not be done and
that he had better cross the Atlantic a
once.
He will, therefore, leave here on this
morning's train and will be absent proba
bly two months. Mr. Baldacci is about
65 years of age. He said last evening, in
speaking of the bequest, that he felt ho
was getting along in years and must take
better care of himself.

Those "Mulrooney" Letter*.
The series of letters purporting to have been
written by a local statesman to his relative
across the seas forms one of the cleverest of
the many clever features that the Wasp has
Droduced in some time, showing up in rather
scathing fashion the way in which our law
makers legislate bills. Sporting matters re
ceive especial attention in the Wasp this ween,
aud among the pictorial attractions are four
full-page Dortralts in halftone of Fiizsimmons
and Sharkey, together with views oi their
training quarters, taken expressly for the
Wasp by bushnell the day before the fight
The Old Maid's Diary contains some amusing
comments on masquerade balls.

Evening.

Odd Fellows' Hall Ablaze With Lights
and Draped in Blue and
White.
Odd Fellows' Hall was the scene of a bril
liant gathering last evening, the occasion
being the first cotillon this season of the
Friday Night Club.
This opening german was not a very large
affair, but what it lacked in numbers it made
up in smartness. Society still lingers at the
country homes, and the wanderers who spent
the summer months tramping abroad or
lingering at fashionable Eastern resorts have
not yet all returned.
Last evening was the debutante's night.
It seemed as though the Friday Night Club
had met but to do her honor. Miss Kate
Salisbury, a pretty "bud," assisted Edward
Green way to lead, and the first set was given
over entirely to the debutantes.
The hall was draped and festooned with
baby blue and white buntingâ debutante
colors. The bunting was arranged in such &
manner as to form a canopy of delicate blue
and white overhead. At regular intervals
from the canopy, depending on long streamers
of the bunting, swung Japanese lanterns filled
to overflowing with long delicate ferns and
fronds.
Gleaming In the midst of festoons and dra
pery were numberless electric-lights. The
effect of the whole was brilliant and beautiful
In the extreme. ,
Six figures were danced â the serpentine,
the figure 8, the Maltese cross, four circles, the
debutantes' march and the wheel.
The music was the latest and best, inter
spersed vow aud then with the rhythmic
measures of Strauss and Waldteufel, which, by
the circuitous march of fashion, are new
once again. After the cotillon the following
elaborate supper was discussed :
Oysters on the half-shell.
Oysters a la poulette.
Terrapin.
Chicken salad.
fchrimp salad.
Turkey.
Ices, gateaux asiorte.
O. H. Munim champagne.
After supper there was general dancing and
the clock in the tower of the Odd Fellows'
building had chimed the second hour of early
morning before the last guest departed.

WONG GIM CAPTURED,
How the Lights Suddenly Went
Out on the Pursuing
Officers.
The Runaway Witness in the Dick
Williams Case Safe in the Mar*
shal's Custody.
Wong Gim, an exceedingly slippery Chi
nese, who is the principal witness in the
Dick Williams case, now in the United
States District Court, was yesterday re
manded to the custody of the Marehal.
On tbe day he was to give his important
testimony against ex-Inspector Williams
he disappeared, and has been diligently
sought for by the officers. Day before yes
terday Special Agent Moore, Assistant
Agent Cnanning and Deputy Marshal
Moffitt went to a room in Chinatown in
search of their man. Upon entering the
building a bell tingled and all the lights
went out. The officers groped around in
the darkness, and finally found the fleet
ing Mongol under a bed occupied by two
ol his countrymen. He was enveloped in
blankets and was snugly hidden away.
District Attorney Henry S. Foote has
bÂ»en informed that Wong Gim was paid
$100 to make himself scarce, and as he ia
now safely in custody there is no doubt
that his testimony will uncover the guilty
party in the case. However, he will be
punished for contempt in not appearing
in court when wanted, and Judge Morrow
will probably give him a severe sentence
as owing to his flight one of the indict
ments against Williams was quashed.
At the request of Judge Dibble, repre
senting the defense, a continuance of tbe
case was granted until next Wednesday.
A PAINTER INJURED.
