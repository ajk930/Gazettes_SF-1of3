ATTACHES A BALLOON TO THE
WARSHIP OF THE AIR.
The Public May Be Given an Aerial View of the
Great Mystery of the Day at a Pre
arranged Time and Place.
' Interest in the great aerial mystery continues without sign of abatement. It still
. furnishes the main theme of discourse in all circles. Many are ready to make oath
â and stake all their earthly possessions that a veritable flying-ship has been hovering
;abore the earth in this vicinity, while the scoffers are also in evidence, equally vocif
erous and insistent.
As yet, however, nothing has transpired that can be accepted as either positive
proof or disproof of the existence of an aerial voyager, operated and controlled by
hnruan Inventive genius.
San JosÂ« has furnished one of the most interesting reports of the mysterious aerial
lights that have yet been published. The strange moving illumination was seen there
by a number of men of the highest standing in the community, and the description
of the phenomenon given by them is both vivid and clear.
General Hart now states that the inventor is a cousin of the electrician of General
Antonio Maceo, commander of the patriot forces in Cuba. He also contributes much
additional information relative to the reputed warship of the air and has promised
to intercede with the inventor to have the invention appear at a prearranged time
and place for the purpose of gratifying the deep and widespread curiosity of the
public
PROFESSOR WORCESTER'S EVIDENCE.
The Well-Known San Jose Educator Scrutinizes the Mysterious Filer
and Gives the Result of a Calm Examination.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Not. 27.â An interesting account of the mysterious moving light
which passed over this city Thursday evening, and which is supposed to be attached
to an airship, is given by Professor H. B. Worcester, president of the Garden City
Business College. Professor Worcester resides with his family in East San Jose. To
a Mercury reporter who asked him regarding the strange light, he said:
.. * "There was a small party at my honse in East San Jose on Thanksgiving day and
"â¢ dinner was prolonged until about 7 o'clock in the evening. The company then re
paired to the front of the house to enjoy some music and I went into the rear yard to
â¢ get a lantern. I happened to lookup and saw several miles away, apparently about
â¢ over College Park or Santa Clara, a large light moving rapidly toward San Jose. In
' .a second I surmised it was the mysterious light which people had seen and which was
. supposed to be attached to an airship. In order to call the attention of those in the
houaÂ« to the same I ran round the house to aave time and called out that the airship
. was passing. Everybody rushed out into the front yard.
"Within the time it had taken me to run around the house the light had changed
its course from east to southwest and had traveled several miles and was in a line
over the southern portion of San Jose. The entire party saw the moving light and
saw it go west, then turn south and then change to southeast Wo watched the light
until it disappeared behind the horizon.
"When the ship turned to the southeast I could distinguish two lights, one behind
â  the other. The single light first seen was about the size of an engine headlight and
â  bad more the appearance of a large incandescent lieht than anything else. It was
moving at tne rate of from 60 to 100 miles an hour and it was only a few moments
before it had disappeared behind the horizon.
"There were three thing. regardi.: e the light which impressed me, viz.: Its
Telocity, its regular movement and its apparent intelligent control. The motion of
. the light would suggest the alternate flapping of wines.
. â¢ .* "I have seen many fire-balloons, but the light I saw had none of the charac
teristic* of such a toy. Its velocity was too great fora balloon on such a still night
and its movements too regular. The light was about 1500 feet high when first seen
and may have continued at that elevation, but it appeared to lower as it disap
peared on the horizon."
. Professor Wore, ster stated that his party consisted of Professor M. 8. Cross of the
University of the Pacific, Mrs. Dr. Allen, Mrs. Colonel Moore, Miss Annie Chase
Harry Worcester and himself. All of these, he said, saw the mysterious light and
. expressed their belief that it was under intelligent control. Among others who saw
the sight wat a party at Bell* Vista, near Alum Rock, composed of Mr. and Mrs. F.
W. Baker, Mr. and Mrs. Henry Rengstorff of Mountain View, Mr. and Mrs. Bert M.
Babcock and Mr. and Mrs. Elton.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Nov. 27. -John Bawl, a farmer who bears the reputation of be
ing practical and unimaginative, declares that he saw the airship in flight over his
â¢ residence in East San Jose, on Monroe street, near Franklin, Thursday evening
and tbongh it was moving rapidly and was at a considerable alt tude. he was able
to plainly distinguish its general outline and most striking features. He describes
the great winged ship with vividness and realism. Hie wife and family corrobo
rate his story.
"I was standing in the rear of my residence about 7 o'clock, or shortly before
" that," be said, "when my attention \7as attracted by some bright object in the sky
about 150 yards distant, and bearing rapidly toward me from the northwest. I
looked ai it closely and observed it was lunging about from side to side, sometimes
swerving sharply to one side, but always maintaining a general southwesterly direc
tion. It occurred to me that this was the famous airship, and I shouted lustily to my
family and they all witnessed It as it came over our residence. It was so high up I
could form no very definite idea of its size.
"It had a pair of wings which were constantly flapping not from side to side like a
I bird's, but with more of a forward and downward motion. Beneath it several feet
â  hung a ball of red light which lit up the bottom of the ship and sent its rays far
down below it. At the front was a cone-shaped projection which I surmised was a
windbreak. The vessel lunged badly and once made a beeline to the west, but re
gained its course again. It varied in height considerably during the time I watched
it. Its speed I judged to be about that of an electric-car doing its best."
Mrs. Bawl tells a similar story of the strange voyager of the air.
The San Francisco Call
SAy FRANCISCO, SATURDAY MORNING, NOVEMBER 28. 1896.
General Hart M*y Give the Public
an Aerial Exhibition of the
Mystery.
Ex-Attorney-Generai W. H. H. Hart
came Â» step nearer to disclosing the name
of the inventor of the reputed successful
airship yesterday He also gave many
new details regarding the marvel, and
promised to confer with the inventor with
the object of bringing the wonder of the
air within the observation of the public at
a prearranged time and place.
"Interest in ibe airship, genera]," re
marked the reporter to the legal captain
of the aerial warship, "continues un
abated, and the public are anxiously
awaiting more definite news in reference
to it. They are demanding; something
more tangible than aerial lights at night."
"I am sorry that 1 am still unable to
tell you all you want to know. I can tell
you this, however: Tue inventor is a
cousiu of John Linn, the electrician of the
Cuban patriot general, Antonio Maceo.
Linn is now, of course, in Cuba, but was
formerly a resident of Chicago, and is an
American citizen. The inventor is not a
Caiifornian, but came here, owing to our
favorabie climate, to make tests of and
perfect his machine."
"It is admitted that the power problem
is the great one in aerial navigation, and
in view of this a detailed description of
the Fargo storage battery which you state
is to be used on the improved and re
modeled craft would be interesting," sug
gested the reporter.
4t l would be glad to comply with your
sug e-tion, but we have only made appli
cation for a patent for this storage battt- ry
in this country, and to expose its com
position and construction would interfere
with the procuration of foreign patents
on it. I reiterate, however, that of my
own knowledge I know that the Fargo
storage battery has sufficient capacity to
furnish power for a flying-ship, it the lat
ter can be constructed to fly at all. This
arrangement is different from all other
methods that have Deen heretofore tried.
No acids are used at all, and it will store
electricity in any amperage and voltage.
A 20-horsepower battery to run ten hours
can be made to weigli 150 pounds, and to
run six hours the battery would need to
weigh not more than 100 pounds. Tests
have been made which prove this. The
man who invented the battery is not the
man who invented the airship."
"Why not have the inventor, in order
so satisfy public curiosity, bring his
winged craft over a certain place at a cer
tain time, giving him suflÃcient latitude
for de, ays and baffling air currents? His
programme could be announced through
you to the public. He would thus run no
risk of identification, nor would his inven
tion be in danger of being exposed. Such
an arrangement would be most gratifying
WE SHOULD HAVE A SECRETARY OF MINING.
Senator Mitchell of Oregon Is Heartily in Favor of the Creation of the New
Department.
To the Editor of THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL:
I have long believed there should be in our Government a Department
of Mining, and am of the opinion that the day has arrived when the sub
ject should be brought to the attention of Congress and urged. The
mining industry is a very important one in this country, and the
various subjects pertaining to this important industry, now con
sidered and treated of in but a perfunctory way in the main in
different bureaus of the Government, should be concentrated in one
grand department, with a general head, similar to the Department of
Agriculture. I stand ready to co-operate with any Senator or mem
ber of the House at the coming session who may be disposed to take
the lead in the matter.

NEARING SOLUTION.
r to the public, and would, at the same time,
I most conclusively substantiate all the
claims made on his behalf."
"He don't care to submit his invention
to the public, and is perfectly indiffer nt
Ito what the public thinks. 1 have an ar
| rangement to see him on Monday, how
| ever, and will then endeavor to have him
carry out the plan. When I last saw nim
j he said be was coing south to test his nia
' chine in the higher altitudes. He is ex
perimenting on the difference between
the heavy atmosphere near the ocean and
the lighter air on elevated pleins. You
see he is preparing to carry out precisely
! what I have said in reference to Havana.
. I know he can and will do It, and be is
I net going to glvt out & description of his
I invention until he makes the attempt on
| Havana. lam quite convinced ho will ba
at Havana within sixty days with one of
those ships equipped to do what he says it
can do."
"This plan, then, of destroying Havana
is a preconceived idea of his?"
'Certainly; and he came out here to
work it oat. I did not know him before
he came to me on this matter, though I
know his friends."
"Have you had my applications to sell
stock in connection with this invention?"
'No, and there is none to selL I asked
my client if he wanted to sell any stock
and he said no. He added that be had all
the money he wanted, ana did not care to
take in any person or organize any com
pany for the present. This was the only
thing that gave me the impression that ne
might be off his pins. He is the first man
I have struck of that kind in California.
But I am quite convinced that he is not
crazy nor a crank. He is thoroughly cool
and logical in all be says, and his entire
conduct is such as to inspire perfect confi
dence in his iuvention and faith in what
he says."
In response to an inquiry as to how he
looked, General Hart said he has a dark
complexion and bears considerable resem
j biance to Arion, now performing at the
Chutes.
HART GETS CONFIDENTIAL.
Discloses New and Important Fea-
tures of the Aerial Mystery to
Professional Friends.
General Hart told a cluster of friends,
principally professional men, gathered in
the Supreme Court rooms yesterday some
thing more about the airship which bis
client has in view. "My client says that
be has built one airship and has success
fully navigated it," said General Hart.
"The first ship cost him $15,000. He says
that he will now construct a second air
ship in the locality of Bolinas and that the
expense will be $30,000.
"So far as I know, the second ship will
resemble the first. I am now willing to
make public tome more facts concerning
the general structure of the ship which
has been operated iv this locality recently.
The sustaining power is supplied from gas
tanks, which are iv the hull of the vessel
and which are connected with the balloon
which flies over the airship by a pipe.
When the inventor wants to go up higher
be lets more gas into the balloon out of the
tanks, which are filled with condensed gas.
"When the inventor wants to fly lower
he simply opens a valve in the balloon
and the contrivance naturally descends,
just as an ordinary balloon does. It appears
to me that the unsafe part of the wnole
contrivance is this reliance upon the bal
loon, which is all that keeps the ship up.
If the balloon would fail down would go
the ship. For this reason lam frank to
say I would not care to take a ride m the
airship. Do I beiieve that the airship actu
ally exists? Why, certainly !
"The inventor says that he has traveled
120 miies in the air in about six and a haJ f
hours, which is a little over twenty miles
per hour. H s storage battery he uses for
power only to propel his airship when he
is sailing against the wind. When he is
running with the wind or a few points off
he needs no power, but naturally drifts,
just as a balloon would.
"I beiieve mat four pouudsof dynamite
thrown vertically downward from the
deck of the airship would make terrific
havoc among an enemy gathered below
the ship. The dynamite throwing could
be done most easily by band. All that
would be necessary would be simply to
drop it.
"The condensed gas serves no purpose
except to raise the airship. It has noth
ing to do with propelling it in any other
direction. '
"It may or may not be possible for my
client's airsnip to sail the air from Key
West to Havana. He thinks that it is
possible. Whenever be arrives in Cuba
his power would be nearly exhausted.
Therefore it would be necessary for him
to have a Cuban base of power supply.
The location may be something like thirty
miles from Havana. That would seem to
me to be about the proper distance."
WAS NOT A PLANET.
Observations by a Clever Watcher
of the Mysterious Light.
The following communication has been
received:
Editor (~dUâ Dear Sib: As public attention
it at present very much taken up with the re
cent appearances of a strange light in the
heavens here and in neighboring places, I ven
ture to offer one or two observations made by
myself personally on the occasion of the ap
pearance of the strange light iv the western
sky some few nights ago, which attracted so
much attention among our citizens. These
observations you may take for what you may
think tnem worth, merely prefacing my re
marks by saying that in years gone by I made
somewn&t of a study of astronomy, and took
quite an interest in the heavenly bodies and
their movements.
On the night in question I was one of a
group of persons stationed near the edge of
the sidewalk in front of the Flood bnlldiug,
southwest corner Fourth and Market streets,
watching a strnnge bright light in the western
heavens. At first it seemed to me as though I
had sometimes seen the evening star look
nearly as iar<Â»e and bright, and so I remarked
to a gentleman in my Immediate vicinity.
But n closer observation seemed to show that
it had n'Â»t the steady and serene rays that
mark the light of a planet. It was observed
for brief intervals from time to time, and its
altitude when I first observed it seemed to
negative the idea of any terrestrial obstruc
tion.
I then decided to make a practical test and
take the bearings from arnat fixed object,
taking the small building with its turret-like
cone that forms a gore at the sonth side uf
Eddy street, at its junction with Market, and
maintaining my position by a telegraph-pole
at tne edge of the bidewalk.
The light appeared to be in a straight line
from where I stood with a point directly over
the aforesaid lurret-llke roof that crowns the
gore at the southwest corner of Eddy and Mar
ket streets. I soon observed that the light
moved from over the point of the roof in an
easterly Bnd northerly direction, until at last
it had crossed the patb In the sky correspond
ing to the width of Eddy street, when it disap
peared around the corner of the fia.dwin
Hotel.
The gentleman above referred to observed
the same thing, and remarked that Dy stepping
backward he could see it a^aln.
This test proved conclusively to my mind
that the light observed was not that of a planet,
for If any one ever saw Venus or any other
planet travel from the westward in a north
easterly direction he must have observed a
phenomenon not recorded in ancient or
modern times.
You may insert the above, if you deem it of
sufficient interest, in your valuable paper.
Yours respectfully, Austin R. Keid,
219 Geary street, City.
MODESTO HAS IT.
Prominent Citizens See What They
Believe to Be Lights of the
Aerial Destroyer.
MODESTO, Cal., Nov. 27.â Residents
in the northern part of this city were
treated to a sigii v t of what was undoubtedly
the flying machine at 10:30 o'clock last
night.
J. E. Ward, cashier of the First National
Bank, discovering what he believed to be
the lights of the flying machine, aroused
his neighbors, ali reputable men, among
whom were County Treasurer W. A.
Downer, Depnty Treasurer W. B. Bell,
C. P. Schafer, the bookkeeper of the First
National Banff, Armory L. J. Maddux and
oibers. The lights were seen at a consider
able height, going in a northwesterly di
rection toward Stockton. The lights
moved steadily and at an even height
from the ground.
SEEN AT TACOMA.
Sighted Near Mount TacomaâVari
colored Flashes.
TACOMA, Wash., Nov. 27â The airship
phenomenon which has startled San Fran
cisco has appeared here. Several reputa
ble people have observed it. They believe
it is an airship and that the inventor has
either made two models and set one up iv
this neighborhood or was taking an even
ing spin from California to Pu et Sound.
The airship seen here resembles that de
scribed by California witnesses in every
particular. It possesses the same birtlike
shape and moves swiftly with an up and
down wavelike motion, varied occasionally
by a dart forward and some times in slant
ing directions.
Last Tuesday nieht the operator of the
airship i 3 believed to have visited and ex
plored the top of Mount Tacoma. Tuesday
niuht Druggist George St. John closed his
drugstore on Pacific avenue at 11:30 and
went home. He reached his residence on
Tacoma avenue fifteen minutes later and
soon retired. It was a beautiful moon
light night and the window curtains a few
feet away from the bed were left up.
Just about 12 o'clock Mra. Bi. John saw
the strange light and called her husband's
attention to it. It appeared to be high up
in the heavens east of Mount Tacoma and
moving in a southeasterly direction. The

NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 27. -The Jack
sonville dispatch giving the details of the
two bloody battles recently fought be
tween Maceo's forces and those of General
Weyler in Pinar del Rio caused great re
joicing among Cubans here to-day. Offi
cial details of the righting have not been
received by tha Junta, but it is expected
that Colonel Jose Reyes, with Maceo's dis
patches to tne delegation, will be here to
morrow.
Horatio Rubens, who is counsel for the
Junta and very close to Delegate Palma,
talked to-day. Senor Palma himself was
too busy.
"We do not care to boast of the victory,"
he said, "as we have only the newspaper
accounts of it as yet to enable us to judge
of its importance. There is no reason to
doubt, however, that the report is sub
stantially correct."
A Times special from Key West says: It
is now positively known in Havana that
General Weyler and his army have been
defeated by Maceo atid his forces in the
province of Pinar del Rio. Full details of
the battle are lacking, but it is known to
have been the most disastrous of the
revolution.
The battle was desperate, and General
Weyler, seeing his men were fighting at a
disadvantage and were being slaughtered,
ordered, a retreat, leaving over 1000 dead
*nd taking his wounded with him. More
than 1000 wounded men reached Havana
Wednesday night, and several trainload,s
are en route. Weyler's troops are said to
be demoralized.
HAVANA, Cuba, Not. 27.â Captain-
General Weyler left Havana at 12:30
o'clock this morning for Mariel on board
the Legaspi. He is accompanied by his
chief of staff and adjutant. Other mem
bers of the general's staff left Havana by
traih this morning for Arlemi-.i.
General Weyler returns to the province
of Pinar del Rio for the purpose of renew
ing the campaign against the insurgent
forces of Maceo in that province, which
was begun under his personal command.
MADRID, Spain, Nov. 27. â General
Weyier has made an urgent request for a
regiment of cavalry, and it will start for
Cuba iv December.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 27âThe
Spanish legation has no intelligence con
firming the report that the Spanish gun
boat Baracua has captured three boats
laden with insurgents and arms off the
the province of Santiago de Cuba. It is
thought at the legation that if there ba
any foundation for the report the boats
contained American refugees who were
trying to effect a landing. The legation
officials give an emphatic denial to the
Key West dispatches which state that
General Weyler and his army were am
bushed while marching through the Rubi
Mountains and that the Spanish loss was
fully 1000.
FIGHTERS FOR CUBA.
They Will Go to th* Inland and Soon nettle
the War.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 27.â An afternoon
paper publishes a interview which pur
ports to come from the local Cuban agent.
The agent states: "As soon as the Cuban's
claim to independence is recognized, 10.
-000 fighting men will :.o .rom this coun
try to aid them. These recruits will be
obtained here. There are plenty of Amer
icans who will enlist. No others are
wanted. If any Americans are caught by
the Spanish aster recognition by the
United States they will have to give them,
the privileges of prisoners of war, which
Americans cannot get now. Within three
months at the longest after the United
States takes such action Cuba will be free.
No attempt will be made to reac ; Presi
dent Cleveland, but Major McKinley is
pledged to our cause, and the Govern
ment will be influenced to take the neces
sary steps."
The Cuban ngent here is said to be di
recting changes which will be made in the
mechanism of a new rapid firing gun of
extra penetrative power, invented by an
lowan named McLean, and negotiations
are pending for Cuba to receive a large
supply of the new firearm if it is success
ful. A local company is said to stand
ready to turn them out as soon as the gun
is accepted. Chairman Cragin of th" local
Cuban relief committee said the newly re
vived league would piove a powerful ally
to the Cubans, and he intended to inquire
of Senor Palma in New York if the pres
ent lino of agitation should be continued.
FOR THE PUR CHASE OF CUBA.
Palma Say* Patriots Are Wilting to
Purchase Freedom.
â  NEvV YORK. N. V., Nov. Thomas
Estrada Palma, the Cuban delegate to the
'United States, when seen" yesterday prac
tically confirmed the story published by
the Senor Jose de Arma-Carriena"> to ; the '
effect that he had, on behalf of the Cuban
patriots, made : a proposition to Prime
Minister Canovas for the -purchase of
Cuba from Spain. Senor Palma says be
had ' two i interviews â  with ' Canovas and
, that the proposition was considered, but2
there was a hitch when it came to the
matter of giving a guarantee that Spain
would carry out her promise. Senor
Palma said to-day that the Cubans are
still ready to treat with Spain and pay a
reasonable sum if the campaign of de
vastation in Cuba is ended. He also said
it was true that Senor Annas went to
Paris last summer and that the senor had
a private understanding with him before
he left.
He said be was not at liberty just now
to say what that proposition was. When
aske i if it was proposed to pay Spain
$100,000,000 for Cuba's independence, Senor
Palma replied: "I do not care to talk
about money or definite sums. It is no
matter about that now, anyhow. But I
will say this, that the Cubans are still
willing to pay a reasonable indemn:ty to
Spain. It must be guaranteed absolute
independence, however, before they will
lay down their arms. Cuba is free now.
We are no idnger a Spanish colony.
"We have arms m our hands that will
make our independence assured, and we
shall never lay them down until the free
dom of Cuba is recognized by Spain and
by the world. At a word from President
Cleveland we are ready to disarm upon a
guarantee of independence. We are ready
to negotiate with Spain as to the amount
to be paid.
"It would be improper for me to speak
for the Cubans now or to say how much
they are willing to concede, DUt if the
United States will guarantee Spain's ac
knowledgement of our independence we
will give the best banker's Guarantee that
we will pay a reasonable indemnity."
NOT PLEASED DITH LEE.
But the Contul- General Will Return All
the Same.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 27.â A Herald
special from Washington says: A repori
has been current here for several days to
the effect that Consul-General Lee wou!d
not return to Havana. Rumors have also
been current to the effect that tbe Spanish
Government was displeased with General
Lee's outspoken sympathy for the insur
gents and that in consequence of the
supposed report in favor of interven
tion he would be considered persona non
grata if he should return to Havana to
resume his duties.
General Lee was asked about these
rumors yesterday. He emphatically stated
that it was his present purpose to return
to Havana in the near future. He inti
mated that he had changed his plans
about taking Mrs. Lee to Havana with
him, and in explanation stated that affairs
there were too unsettled to make any
plans for her stay in that city. He would
not discuss the question of Spain's feeling
toward him.
Mr. Lee does not believe there will be
any immediate change in t! c policy of the
administration, and it is believed he is
rather disappointed. He is convinced
that intervention by the United States
will come sooner or later and, although he
will not admit it, there are reasons for
believing that he was anxious to have the
President announce an intervention pol
icy in his forthcoming message. There
are as: urances from several official sources
that the President will do nothing of the
kÂ».nd. If developments in Cuba or Spain
necessitate a cnanee of poicy it will be
announced in a special message.
A Cabinet officer said yesterday that tbe
President fully realized the inability of
Spain to end the war during the present
winter and that the United States could
hardly be expected to keep its hands off
much longer. At the same time the
President was reluctant to adopt a more
aggressive policy than he had followed in
tbe paÂ«t for the reason that he does not
want to do anything that will disturb the
business interests ot the country.
IN HOSPITAL, AND JAIL
Spaniard* Very -Busy Caring for th%
Sick and Prisoner*.
HAVANA, Cuba, Nov. 27.â Nothing
special has been received concerning the
operations in the field. The official
statistics show that there are now 17,340
soldiers sick in the venous military hos
pitals. Out of this number 1418 are suffer
ing with yellow fever.
Eight hundred and fifty persons who
liave been sent into exile for political
crimes will do sent to tha prisons at
Cbafrinas 'to-morrow. A train which
arrived here to-day from Artemisa,
province of Pinar del Rio, brought seven
teen officers and 473 privates, who are to
sick that it was necessary to brinp them
here for treatment. The steamer Bolivar
brought to-day seven officers and 240
privates, all sick, from tbe same province.
General Weyler arrived safely at
Artemisa by way of Mariel to-day, and it
is said that it is his intention to leave at
once for the field.
CANNOT CELEBRATE IT.
Twenty- Fifth Annirer.tnry of the Execu
1' tion of Student*. " â¢
KEY WEST. Flal, Nov. 27.â is the
twenty-fifth anniversary of the execution
of the students of the University of
Havana, who were tried and . condemned
by court-martial in 1871 for the alleged
violation of the tomb of Don Gonzales
Csstano, the Snanish journalist, but ow
ing to the condition of feelin* growing out
of the insurrection the authorities have
forbidden the customary celebration of
mass in the Havana Cathedral, and which
has always been made the occasion of
turbulent demonstrations on the part of
the students and radicals, and have also
forbidden oil public demonstrations â¢in
commemoration of the anniversary. -
In tins city, New York and â¢ elsewhere,

themselves with billets of wood and made
an attack. Tbe non-uuion ni^n defended
themselves vigorously and a serious fight
resulted. In the end tbe non-union men,
who were greatly outnumbered, were
worsted and compelled to letreat. They

Hamburg to-morrow.
The Hamburg correspondent of the

said to-day that he had nothing to do
with the dock strike in Hamburg, and the

Lady Scott Wrote Rather Affectionate
Letters to Her Son-in-Law, Earl
Russell.
LONDON, Exo., Nov. 27.â The trial of
Lady Scott and the male defendants,
Cockerton, Aylott and Kast, for having
criminally libeled Earl Russell, was con
tinued to-day, with Earl Russell still In
the witness-box. Sir Frank Lockwood,
for the prosecution, resumed his re-exam
ination of the plaintiff, who referred to
t) is relations with a certain girl prior to
his marriage to Lady Scott's daupbt r.
Witness said that he had told Lady Scott
all about this affair before the welding
took place, and had also told her about
the charge that was made aeainst him
which had resulted in his expulsion from
Oxford. . .
Counsel read a letter written by Lady
Scoti to Earl Russell in which she told
him she loved him dearly and urged him
to bring all bis troubles to her. Earl
Russell said that this letter was sent to
him by Lady Scott after he had communi
cated to ber tbe incident* of his past life.
Su George Lane, a cousin of Earl Rus
sell, was called to the stand. He testi
fied that he had objected to Earl Russell's
marriage to Lady Scott's daughter and
warned him against association with Lady
Scott on account of her notoriously bad
character. Witness said he was on board
Earl Russell's yacht at the same time
that lon Tbynne was a guest on ooard
and it was not true, as alleged, that he
had ever seen anything wrong there. If
Aylott stated be had seen him threaten
to (strike Earl Russell, with a coal hammer,
Aylott lied.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 28, 1896.
GEORGE DIXON
MET HIS MATCH
Outboxed by Frank Erne,
the Clever Feather-
Weight
Twenty Furious Rounds Before
the Broadway Athletic
Cluh.
Referee Austin Djcided That the
Buffalo Boy Made the Most
Telling Points.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 27.-Frank
Erne, the ciever feather-weight from Buf
falo, went up several'rungs in the ladder
of pugilistic fame by outpointing George
Dixon, the famous colored champion, in
their twenty-round encounter at the
Broadway Athletic Club to-night.
The decision was received with ap
plause, but there were many who thoueht
the result should have been a draw.
R^eree Sam C. Austin, however, con
sidered that Erne had outpointed his op
ponent, with a good deal to spare. It was
a fast and splendid battle from start to
finish. Dixon began hostilities with his
usual whirlwind rushes, but in Erne he
found his match. Erne stopped the col
ored cyclone wiih straight left jabs in the
face, and pretty soon Dixon's left eye was
badly cut and almost closed, while before
the finish his other optic was also swollen.
Dixon did nearly all the leading, but,
with the exception of a series on the body.
Erne succeede t in countering, and, in
addition, when he took a hand in the
leading he smashed the colored boy with
out ceremony. There is no doubt but t bat
in Erne Dixon has found his match. Erne
demonstrated his cleverness. Beyond the
red and raw spots on his eye, the Buffalo
boy seemed none tbe worse for his en
counter at the finish, and was, if any
thing, a trifle fresher than Dixon.
There were about 2500 people in the house
when Dixon made hi-, appearance at 9:45.
Tbe colored champion looked as if he was
trained a bit too fine and his face appeared
drawn and worried. There was a few
minutps' delay before Erne appeared. He
seemed to be trained to the hour and looked
in fine condition.
Erne's seconds were Charlie White, Mike
Leonard and Frank Zimper. Dixon's
aids were Tom O'Rourke, Joe Eims,
Jimmy de Forest and Tommy West. Bo h

REJOICING AT PALO ALTO.
Football Men, Sore but Jubilant, Fight
the Great Thanksgiving Game
Over Again.
BTANFORD UNIVERSITY. Cal., Nov.
27.â 1n spiteof the fact that a special train
was run last evening to take the student*
back to Palo Alto after the Thanksgiving
day football game, but few took advantage
of the opportunity. A larger crowd came
down on the morning train to-day. AH
had husky voices as a result of continual
cheering; all were smiling and jubilant
The football game was again fought over
in the cars, and will probably be discussed
for many days to come. Attention was
called to a statement made at the recent
football rally, iff which Clemens '94, Stan
ford's star halfback, said:
"With such material, you ought to de
feat Berkeley worse than you have ever
done before. You ought to win by a score
oi at least 20 toO "
This was the score Stanford made.
The news of the victory was received
last evening with great c uhu iasm by the
citizens of Palo Alto. The tscore is dis
played in several of the show-windows
and has been posted on all the bulletin.
boa r ds at the university. On all sides
The Call was praised for Its complete,
nccurute and unbiased report of the game.
The supply of Calls at both newsstands
was soon exhausted this morning. A
fresh supply was obtained from neigh
boring towns, but it, too, was soon con
sumed.
Most of Stanford's piayers feel the effect
of ttieir hard game of yesterday. Genial
"II ff" Williams is unable to welcome bis
frien s with his accustomed broad smile.
This is due to tbe fact that a number of
large patches of skin vere rubbed from
bis face during the game, and it is painiul
tq even look pleasant. In addition to this
his muscles are quite sore. Owing to the
style of play adopted by Stanford heY
backs feel tbe effects of the game the
most. The elbows of the men wÂ«re bruised
in falling after "bucking the line." Fisher
has both of his elbows iv bad condition.
Both Searigut and Cotton are sufferi ng
from the same kind of injuries. One of

All of the football men will have re

UNIVERSITY TRLETEN.
hepretentatiret of Bonrd% of Control
Are in Conference.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 27.âRepresenta
tives of the athletic boards of control of
tbe universities of Wisconsin, Minnesota,
Chicago, Northwestern Illinois, Lake
Forest and Purdue (lnd.) assembled this
morning in special conference at the Chi
cazo Beach Hotel for the purpose of con
sidering a number of questions of vital
importance to college athletics.
Among these is the matter of the six
month ru.e and the four- year rule.
Michigan objected to the six-month rule
when it was suggested at the meeting in
this ctty last year, and has steadily re
fused to adopt it. Minnesota ia the only
Western college to absolutely put it iv
force, and the attitude of Michigan has
been made the basis of charges of prof s
sionali.-m. Tne Ann Arborites are a>>out
tired of defendiuc themselves, and have
instructed Professor Knowlton, their rep
resentative at to-day's conference, to an
nounce their adhe-ion hereafter to the
six-month rule. The conference will be
asked to make a strong stand for purity
in Wesiern intercollegiate athletics. It is
probable tnat rules will be adopted which
will i luce the West upon tbe same footing
as the East concerning requirements and
regulation of athletes.
Chicago* Claim the Championship.
CHICAGO, 111.. Nov. 27.- The Chicago
University eleven has decided not to ac
cept tbe challenge of the Northwestern
University football team for a third game.
Manager Haller of tne Evanston team had
a conlerence with Professor Stacg to-day
endeavoring to arrange a game for next
week, to take place in the Coliseum. Pro
fessor Stagg positively refu-ed to make
any sucn arrangement, and intimated that
the recent defeat of the Northwestern by
tne Maroons put them out of the cbarn
oionsbip race, notwithstanding the fact
that they played a draw game with Wis
consin yesterday.
The Cbica.-o eleven stopped training
yesterday, and it is improbable that they
will play again this season. Profe-sor
Ftagg claims that Chicago, by de:eat<ng
Michigan University yesterday, is entitled
to the Western co'legiate luotball cham
pionship lor 1896.

THE GREAT BEARS' GAVE.
One of the Greatest Natural Cariosities
in Pennsylvania.
One mile from the hamlet cf Hillside,
on the Pennsylvania Railroad halfway up
the Chestnut Ridge, is the famous Bears'
Cave, one of the greatest natural curiosi
ties in Pennsylvania. All the way from
tbe little station the road is bowered by
chestnut, maple and oak, surpassing far
in beauty Lovers' Walk at We3t Point.
It makes a most delightful stroll, a sur
prise to city people, and, in fact, too few
know of the near existence of such a
wonder as tbe cave.
Tbe entrance is far more picturesque
than that of Mammoth Cave, Kentucky.
Immense ledges of rock and great bowl
ders shadow the mouth of the cave, from
which in the summer is constantly rollinj:
out a volume of air with a iflmperature of
about 60 degrees. I made my first explora
tion of Great Bears' Cave in the summer
of 186 L I made a second exploration in
1866 and a third last week. Among the
Pittsburg gentlemen stilt living who were
in the party oj 1866 are William 8. Miller,
Ed P. Long, Dr. Thomas D. Davis and
Major Hugh Logan of Logan's Ferry. We
were well provided with balls of twine,
lanterns, candies and matches, and ex
plored the cave at least one mile. There
are large rooms and small, abrupt de
scents, a gurgling ptream, "fat man's
misery," small lakes, stalagmites and sta
lactites in brief, all the attractions of a
well-regulated cave. Over the mouth of it
niisrht be built a hotel which would have a
decided cool temperature all through tbe
heated season. Some of tbe pictrresque
mountain scenery n ar is being defaced
by the "Bine Rock fiends" to get the
blocks for the streets of Pittsburg. â Pitts

distance from Tacoma must have been at
least fifty miles. They watched tbe heav
enly stranger over half an hour. T..ey
first law it through a north window in
their room, but after a while could see it
through a window several feet further
south without having changed their posi
tions. This proves that the airship trav
eled a long distance during the time they
were watching it.
Mr. St. John says that vari-colored
lights were shot forth in ail directions.
T..ey were emitted from each end and
both sides. Sometimes tbe light at one
end or one side wonld be cut off. Some of
tbe lights were white, others red, blue and
green. Tuese four shades were distinctly
visible. When all the lights were shining
the aerial monster seemed incased in a
brilliant clow, having tbe appearance of a
powerful electric searchlight The size
then seemed to be that of an arc light. It
flashed often, sending tbe various colored
raya shooting out from the center in
every direction like spokes in the hub of a
wheel. Sometimes it had a wavering
motion and swayed bacz and forth in its
course through the heavens like a vessel
at sea in a storm, but the unduiaang
motion was its chief course, being varied
by frequent dartings.
The moonlight was not strong enough
to permit a distinct view of Mount Ta
coma, but the airship was seen to ap
proach the neighborhood of the mountain
at what seemed to be its exact height, and
dart hither and thither as if an explora
tion was in progress.
Tbe supposed airship was still in sight
when Mr. and Mrs. St. John became tired
of watching it and went to sleep. They
spoke of the strange occurrence to many
friends next day, but what they had wit
nessed was not made public until to-day.
They have eagerly read accounts of the
California airship, and declare that what
they si'.w must have been the same or an
exactty similar contrivance.
Hundreds of people are on the lo.okout
here for another appearance of the airship.

Injury.
MOOREHEAD, Minn., Nov. 27.â One of
the severest blizzards tbat has in years
visited this section is raging to-day. It
has been on twenty-four hours, and there
is no prospect of abatement. Traffic in tbe
streets and business is suspended. Nearly
all passenger and freight trains are
snowed in, but the Northern Pacific man
, aged to move one passenger train this
â¢ morning. No 9, northbound, on the
Great Northern, reached here an hour late
this evening, but got stalled at the depot
and had to be due out. It took roar power
ful engines to take four passenger coaches
across the river to Fargo, where further
. trouole is feared. The trains are unpro
vided with enow plows, which render* tbe
engines almost helpless. The snow in
' some places is four and five ieet deep.
DEVILS LAKE, N. D., Nov. 27.â A
trainload of cattle are reported stuck in
' -the drift, near Churchs ferry, and frozen
to death. Tbe wires are down, forbidding
direct communication.
ST. PAUL, Minn.. Nov. 27.â Tbe storm
which has been raging throughout the
Northwest for the past forty-eight hours
is the severest that has visited this section
since the blizzard of January 12, 1888, in
which 107 lives were lost. No lives are
reported lost in this storm, but there is a
complete blockade of traffic in Northern
Minnesota, North Dakota and portions of
South Dakota. Trains into St. Paul from
the West are from five to ten hours late.
It is four degrees below zero here to-night,
with a terrific north wind blowing.
FERGUS FALLS, Mink., Nov. 27.â
. Trains are badly delayed. The mercury
is at zero. Business is suspended.
ARGYLE, Minx, Nov. 27.â The worst
blizzard ever known here has been raging
for the past thirty-six hours. Drifts in
the str ets are as high as the buildings
alongside. Trains are tied up. The storm
shows no signs of abatement. There may
be a number of deaths reported later.
LINCOLN, Nebr., Nov. 27.â Dispatches
from Southeast and Central Nebraska tell
of zero weather and high north winds.
To-day and to-flight were tlie coldest for
November in the State for years. Among
small farmers stock is provided for, but fur
ther north on the range there will be loss.
Not half of tbe corn crop has been gath
ered, and with a heavy coating of ice,
' which prevents husking, hundreds of
thousands of bushels seem destined to lie
in the fields until spring.
OMAHA, Nebr., Nov. 27.â A1l the roads
running west and northwest have been
busy for tbe past thirty-six hours getting
up tbe telegraph wires and poles tbat went
down in the storm. The Elk Horn was
put in the worst plight of all. Four hun
dred poles were down.
Tbe St. Paul and Omaha lines are all in
bad shape near Sioux City and Mankato,
Minn. In a stretch of eighteen miles the
wires were broken in fifty place?, forty
one poles down and fifty-eight cross-arms
broken. Since early Thursday morning
there ha 3 been no telegraphing over the
Union Pacific west of Columbus. Six
hundred poles are down. The Burlington
did not have a great deal of trouble ou its
Western lines.

struck a corner of Tunison, Miss., la-t
night, wrecking a boxcar, several small
houses and killing a negro woman, be
. Hides seriously injuring half a dozen
others. It scattered household effects
over a broad area.
WACO, Tex., Nov. 27.â A cyclone visited
a section twenty miles southeast of Waco
Wednesday and demolished several farm
houses. Damage occurred near the town
of Mart, McLennan County, with which
there is no telecrapbic communication.
. News comes from Reisel, six miles from
Mart, that the residence of R. A. Douglass
was totally destroyed, his wife severely
hurt and one of his children was killed
outright.
Five persons were more or less injured,
as far as heard from. The temperature
ranged nearly at summer heat. In passing
over the prairie the cyclone took away
everything it touched, leaving the earth
bare of grass. It was a mile wide and
eight miles long.
PADUCAH, Ky., Nov. 2.-owing to the
"wires being down only meager details of
the storm which swept West Paducah last
night have reached here. One house was
destroyed at Fulton and considerable other
damage done here. A man and child are
missing from Kuttawa, Ky. It is believed
they were blown into the Cumberland
River and drowned. The depot was
wrecked at Eddyfield, a factory blown
down and the courthouse unroofed.
FLOOD AND EARTHQUAKE.
Many Persons Drowned in the Raging
lorrents in Europe.
LONDON, Eno., Nov. 27.â The News
will to-morrow publish a disDatch fiom
the Piraeus saying that eighty persons are
missing and that it is belived that they are
drowned.
The Times to-morrow will publish a dis
patch from Athens saying the storm
which caused the flood was unparalleled
for violence. It was accompanied by
slight earthquakes. Tbe liissus River,
which is a very small stream rose twenty
feet, and all bridges spanning it except
two were demolished. It is believed that
tbe ancient monuments in the path of the
flood have not been injured. The dam
age to factories at the Piraeus amounts to
20,000,000 drachmas. It is believed the
villages of Attica have suffered severely,
but the interruption of communication
prevents any information reaching Athens
from there.

CLEVELAND PREPARING HIS FAREWELL MESSAGE
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 27.â President Cleveland has been devoting a great deal of time to his annual message during
the last week and now has it well in hand, so that it can be finished in a couple of days. This message is expected to be one of
the ablest public documents Cleveland has written during his two terms. It will be, in a sense, his farewell to the American peo
ple as their chief executive, and there is little doubt that he will embrace the opportunity to mark out the course he believes
ought to be followed by the National Government for the maintenance and advancement of the honor and prosperity of the country.
Foreign affairs will naturally claim considerable attention, and the President will have an opportunity to congratulate Con
gress and the country upon the solution of the Venezuelan boundary controversy in a manner honorable and satisfactory alike
to the United States and to Great Britain and Venezuela. The condition of affairs in Turkey will be discussed in deiail, and the
President will be able to snow tbat the ordinary diplomatic agencies have snfficed for the protection of American life and property
in the Turkish empire.
TUe last paragraphs of the message to be written will be those dealing with the situation m Cuba. He will avail himself of
tbe latest possible information as to the military situation in the island, and the prospects for the early success or failure of the in
surgents may have much to do with shaping his policy. Present indications are that he will make no radical recommendations
on this subject
Although there is no prospect for enactment of any revenue or financial legislation during the rest of his term Cleveland is
understood to be preparing for an elaborate discussion of these subjects, and will recommend legislation which he believes, if
carried out, will put the treasury aud tbe financial system of the country on a sound basis. The President will doubtless express
his approval of recommendations for increasing the revenue by imposing revenue duties on tea and coffee and increasing the
internal revenue tax on beer. Tbe financial reform recommendations of the message will be along the lines of Cleveland's former
recommendations, and wili have as tbeir basis the advocacy of the single gold standard as tbe foundation of the monetary system
of the country.
The retirement of the greenbacks and the Sherman notes will be recommended, so as to take the Government entirely out
of the business of issuing promissory notes. Banking reform will be recommended at the same time, to enable the banks of the
country to issue circulating votes which will be safe and which can be expanded or contracted in volume to meet the needs of the
business of the country.
Cleveland is alive to the necessity of continuing the expansion of tbe navy and of constructing coast defenses to pot the
country in a condition to resist foreign aggression, and the recommendations made on these lines made by Secretaries Lamont
and Herbert in their annual reports will be seconded in the message.
a matter of fact the instrument dated for
a period of seventeen years from Novem
ber 27, 1879.
It has been officially stated by high offi
cers of tlie Western Union Telegraph
Company that no steps have been taken
looking to an extension ol the contract,
and which has virtually been the main
stay of the Bell company, and it is there
fore believed that the Western Union pro
poses to go into the telephone business for
itself. The developments of the next few
months in this connection will be awaited
with interest by telephone-users through
out the country as well as by tbe inde
pendent telephone manufacturers.
MASKED HIGHWAYMEN FOILED.
An Unsuccessful Attempt Made to Hold
Up an Electric-Car at a
Lonely Spot
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Nov. 27.-Four
masked highwaymen made an unsuccess
ful attempt to hold up an electric-car mid
way between this city and Independence
at midnight last night. The leader, Oscar
Bridges, said to be a bridge and parachute
jumper, was caught and brought to this
city to-day. He gave the names of his
companions as Eugene Ridgway, a barber,
and Ernest Ridgway, a professional high
diver, both of Shoenfeld, a suburb near
the scene of the hold-up, and James Re
pine, whose home is in Centropolis, a
suburb of this city. A saloon-keeper has
given information which makes it almost
positive that the men are tbe gang which
boldly held up a westbound Cnicago and
Alton train just outside Independence
about a month ago.
The electric-car was filled with theater
goers, and when it reached a ionely spot
Bridges jumped on tbe rear platform,
went through to the front end and thrust
a revolver in the motorman's face. An
other robber entered tbe rear door and
was in the act of ordering the passengers
to hold up their hands when the con
ductor threw him irom the car. The mo
torman was able to start his car, and tbe
other robbers, who were to have covered
the conductor, escaped to the woods with
tbe third man. Bridges was fighting with
me motorman, who was aided by some
male passengers, while the women
screamed in fright and fainted. Bridget
was finally overcome without firing a shot
and the car proceeded to Independence.
LEFT A BIG SHORTAGE BEHIND.
Funds of an lowa State Bank Looted by a
Cashier Who Recently Departed
for His "Health."
COUNCIL BLUFFS, lowa, Nov. 27.â
John C. Watts, cashier of the State Bank
of Neola, lowa, left the city several days
ago stating that he was going to Denver
for his health. Information reached this
city to-night that the officials of the bank
bad discovered a shortage of nearly $10,
-000, which they were inclined to charge
up to Watts.
Georee E. Kings of Dcs Moines, the pres
ident of the bank, has been in Neola for
two or three days looking into the case,
and Judge Bancroft of Dcs Moines, said to
be a director or stockholder in tbe bank,
is also there. Tbe investigation got pretty
close to the bottom of matters this even
ing, and tbe facts elicited seemed to war
rant the action taken.
The bondsmen of Mr. Watts at once
came in and deposited sufficient money to
cover the probable shortage. Mr. Watts is
a son of M. A. Watts, formerly County
Auditor of Greene County and cashier of
the Council Bluffs Savings Bank.
JUeseiean Corn Shipments.
SAN ANTONIO, Tex., Nov. 27.â The
rush of corn shipments to Mexico through
here has been tbe heaviest ever known
during the past three weeks, and the
transferring capacity of the roads at tbe
border has been taxed to its fullest capa
city. The great bulk of corn comes from
Kansas, lowa and Nebraska, where it in
purchased for 10 cents to 15 cents per
bushel and sold in Mexico as hieh as
$2 per bushel, Mexican currency. In
addition to these shipments by mil heavy
exportation} are being made by water for
the most southern States of Mexico.

Persecnted Christians â¢ Who Are

statement bas just been issued by the gen

tian Temperance Union:
hkado.cartbrs of the world'B women's)
Christian Temperance. >
The Temple, Chicago. 111.. Nov. 25, 1896.)
To my Comrades and to All Who Love and Trust
tne: From the lirst you bave helped tbe bunted
Armenians by your prayers, your sympathy
and your honest, bard work. Thousands of
them are to-day In comfort or in safety bocauie
of tbe intelligence and devotion with which
you have wrought for our Christian brothers
and sisters and tbe little children on the bleak
and dangerous hillsides, and in those valleys
smitten by outrage an>l murder.
It is a blessed fact that' "patient continuance
in well doing" is tbe foremost quality in a
wbite ribboner, for we must do our first works
over again, "and more also." Hereafter tbe
Armenians can never feel a sense of safetyâ
at least not in our time. Tbe more forceful
among them are determined to risk all in the
effort to reach freedom, and wbile it is not
for us to strengthen this purpose on tbeir
part, we must hold ourselves in readiness to
help the refugees who are constantly escap
ing from the dominion of the Turks. But we
must not let this work cause us to cease send
ing help to the shelterless and starving who
remain in that hapless country.
We must give money to establish industrial
homes and orphanages for the women and
children, but it must be apparent to all that
if we can help to find homes and work for tbe
starving refugees we have at the same time
helped to set the Armenian people on their
feet and to put a new hope in their hearts for
the future. The sorrowful and outraged
women can do little for their nation. The
vigorous and forceful fHmllies and youth who
have the energy and skill to save themselves
alive by making their escapes are full of
promise for the years to come. They are de
voted to the interests of their country and de
termined to live rather than die for her.
Thousands of them are penniless to-day in
Bulgaria, Alexandria, Marseilles and all along
the border of the accursed Turkish Empire.
It is the purpose of the leaders you have
chosen and who believe they are but carrying
lorwara your wishes into deeds to establish a
home for refugees at some strategic point,
possibly in Bulgaria, which shall belong to the
World's W. C. T. U., and shall testify to tbe
loyalty and tenderness of our society toward
those who most needed our help at a time
when tbe heart of the whole world was
stirred by theirunutterable misery.
May I not, in closing, urge upon all good peo
ple the significance of making Christmas offer
ings this year at least for the most part to the
Armenians who are starving in their own
country, or as a refuge for Armenians who
have escaped, sending In either case to Mrs
Helen M. Baker, treasurer of the National W
C. T. U., the Temple, Chicago. In this prayer
and hODe, I am yours tor the deliverance of
God's most loyal people, Frances E. Willard,

AS TO THE LONG HAUL,
Railroad Companies Petition the Inter
state Commerce Commitsion.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 27.â The
railroad companies doing business be
tween common points in Colorado and
terminal points in California have peti
tioned the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion for relief from the fourth section of
the i nier.-t tte com mere* act so "thai the/
may be authorized in the transportation of
like kinds of property to charge less com
pensation in tlie aggregate tor the longer
distances between Colorado points aud
California terminal points than for shorter
distances over the same lines in the same
direction, the shorter being included
within the longer distance."
Tbey represent in their prayer that
competition with water transportation
Irom Atlantic Coast points tG Pacific mar
kets renders necessary a lower through
rate than they can afford to make on
business which is not carried entirely
through. Tne commission has ordered a
hearing on the petition for December 18.
The companies^ are also ordered to light
their existing tariffs on through and local
business, together with the changes they
wish to make in case suspension of the

STATE OUT OF THE CLUB.
Prince Iturbide Mot a Proper Person
to Asuociate With Gentlemen.
WASHINGTON, D. C., Nov. 25.â The
jury in the case of Prince Iturbide, the
adopted heir of the late Emperor Max
imilian of Mexico, against the Metropoli
tan Club of this city to-day returned a
verdict in favor of the club.
Iturbide was expelled by the board of
governors last May upon the charge of
having made certain accusations against
the daughter of a fellow member, ami he
brought suit for a writ of mandamus to
compel the club to reinstate him, alleging
tbat hf had not been fairly tried by the
board of governors.
Judge Bradley, presiding, said that it
was out of the province of tbe court to say
whether or not the governors acted wisely
in applying the extreme penalty lor the
offense charged. The only question at
issue, the JudgÂ« said, was whether, when
Itnrbide was before the governors, he was
fairly and fuliy apprised of the charge
against him ? Iturbide says he will appeal
the case.

SILVER LEADERS
WANT "ORGANS"
They Claim That All the
Influential Press Is Not
With Them.
So They Are Talking Wildly
About Starting Newspapers
in Several Cities.
But tbe Sad Experience of Others in
That Line Should Cool Their
Ardor Somewhat.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 27.â 1t has
been a frequent cause of lament among
silver leaders tbat all the influential press
of the East and West was arrayed against
their cause. Mr. Bryan in his campaign
made several allusions to this, as did
others of his side on the stump. Some of
the silver mine owners have more* than
once in the last three or four years indi
cated an inclination to remedy this, if it
be made practicable. Since the election
there has been a good deal of cheap talk
on this subject, and from the manner in
which some of tbe wiid-eyed silver
orators let themselves loose it might be
imagined that nothing is easier than to
start a newspaper and keep it going.
It bas been given out here that arrange
ments are ou foot to establish newspapers
to be devoted to the advocacy of silver in
Washington, Baltimore and Lousville. It
is asserted, but of this there is absolutely
no evidence, that a large fund bas already
been raised and partial engagements
entered into for a staff of writers and cor
respondents.
However, a damper is likely to be thrown
upon the* dreams of some of these news
paper magnates when they discover what
is really essential for the establishment of
a newspaper in a great city on anything
like a substantial or promising basis.
One of the biggest newspapers of New
York City, which is said to have spent
$10,000,000, is now in the hands of a re
ceiver, and another, which is known to
have thrown away $5,000,000 In a vain ef
fort to get on a paying basis, has very re
cently given up the ghost. No one can
count the money which has been lost in
trying to build up newspapers in that city
and in other cities in competition with al
ready firmly established journals, whose
fonndations are laid in tho respect and
confidence of the people. An experienced
man of business in journalism said to
some of those who ars ambi ious to distin
guish themselves that it would be sheer
folly to think of venturing on a newspaper
enterprise of such magnitude.

Young Woodusard Ridint Across the
Continent on a Jionkeff.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 27.â Astride
a small donkey R. Pritchard Woodward,
a young Brooklyn man, 6 feet 6 inches tall,
left the Hotel Bartholdi, Twenty-third

for San Francisco, as the result of an elec
tion bet between himself and Benjamin
Lillard, a Brooklyn publisher, which was
made just before the election when Wood
ward offered the bet and Lillard accepted.
It is stipulated in the conditions of tbe
bet that Woodward must pass through
Canton and call on Major McKinley.
From there he ia to go to Lincoln and pay
a visit to Mr. Bryan.
Woodward made his informal start from
Brooklyn at 1 o'clock this afternoon, but
by bis contract he had to go to the "seat
of defeat," the former Democratic head
quarters in the BartholdL
Woodward leaves the city penniless.
He must make his way to San Francisco
within a year and must earn his living as
he goes. He expects to reach San Fran
cisco in eight months. Sbould he not get
there in twelve months he will be com
pelled by bis contract to forfeit a stipu
lated sum of money.
Many young tociety people from Brook

ward make his start.
SILVER LEAVERS TO CONFER.

porter for the United Associated Presses
that he was waiting to receive the form of

tions to issue it himself. He said it was
expected Mr. Bryan would be present to
offer a.ivice and be consulted regarding
tbe best plan to solidify the free silver
forces and conduct an aggressive educa
tional campaign under organization if
possible. The idea is to hold the silver
forces together and lose no ground during
the next four years, besides making new
converts to the cause. Senators Jones,
Butler, Teller, Dubois and Pettigrew;
Governors Altgeld and Stone, Messrs!
Wasbburn and Towne and the executive

subject.

DEATH OF A DRUNKEN FATHER.
Shot Down by a Son Whom He Was
Trying to Kill With a
Rifle.
STRATTON, Nkbr., Nov. 27.â J. W.
Burney of this city was to-nieht shot and
killed by his son, a young- man 21 years o:
age. The deed was provoked by the* elder
Burney, who threatened the life of the
youth. The tragedy occurred at the fam
ily residence. About supper time Mr.
Burnev, who has been on a prolonged
spree since the election, procured a rifle
and repairing to his home demanded that
Mrs. Burney call the "kid" as \he time
bad come when he must shoot both of
them. The young man happened to be in
an adjoining room and overhearing the
conversation came out only to be con
fronted by his father, who pointed the gun
at him. At first the boy begged the en
raged man to spare his life, but without
avail. As the father drew back to cock tbe
rifle young Burney seized his own gun,
which stood near by in a corner, and be
fore the drunken man could again take
careful aim, sent a ballet into his father's
breast Mr. Burney expired in half an
hour.

GUAYAQUIL WAS
RAZED BY REBELS
The Fire That Destroyed the
City Followed a
Battle.
Heavy Fighting on the Streets
of the Republic's Pic
turesque Capital.
Wives and Daughters of the Insur
gents in the Thick of the
Engagement.
SAN DIEGO. Cal., Nov. 27.â The Brit
lÂ»h sloop-of-war Wild Swan arrived yes
terday afternoon from Guayaquil, via
Acapulco. It brings an interesting story
of the ereat fire tuat devasted Guaya
quil, the ancient capital of Ecuador, on
October 6. From the officers of the
Wild Swan and from the newspapers they
bring it appears that the fire waa started
by the rebels who had Deen in the city
fighting the Government troops a few
days before. The Wild Swan had been
sent to Guayaquil from Callao to protect
British interests during the conflict, and
when hostilities seemed to have ceased it
returned to Callao, having the British
Minister to Guayaquil aboard. The
steamer had not been long in Callao be
fore orders were received to hasten back
to Guayaquil, as fire had destroyed the
greater part of tne city. Clothing, pro
visions and means cf shelter were ordered
to be taken along.
The Wild Swan arrived at Guayaquil on
October 19 and found two-ttiirds of the
city in ashes. The poorer people had al
ready been attended by several relief so
cieties organized in the city, and supplies
had been received from Chilean and Pern
vian vessels sent for the purpose by those
governments.
"The poor people were the last to com
plain of the fire," said an officer of the
Wild Swan. "They seemed to like the
idea, and were better clothed, fed and
sheltered than they had ever been before.
Some were in favor of burning the rest of
the town, so as to keep up the stream of
charity flowing in upon them. We had
hard work to get r:d of our supplies. No
body wanted the provisions, as there were
plenty, and we had 1200 pieces of clotuing,
some of which were entirely new.
"We saw no sign of trouble upon our
second visit, the rebels having been driven
into the mountains. But the beautiful
city, one of the most picturesque in the
tropics, lay desolate. I took a number of
photographs of the city before and after
the lire, and one can see by them the ter
rible loss of property. Among the build
ings desiroyed was the Church of Santo
Domingo, which was believed to be the
oldest m South America. It stood on an
eminence, an extremely beautiful build
in?.
"On our first visit, just before the fire,
we saw some lively fighting in the streets
between the rebels and the Government
troops. 0- course neither sidÂ« dared to
attack the British legation or meddle witn
British property, as we would have opened
fire at once. The slaughter in the streets
on one occasion was tremendous. The
rebels were in some cases accompanied by
tneir women, who rede astride, carried
ritles and displayed me createst bravery.
I saw a big lellow shot off his horse and
trampled under foot, while a woman who
rode with him, probably Lis trie, stood
her ground and poured hot shot into tne
enemy until ne retreated. Then she
managed to cet her mate across tne saddle
and rode away with the rest of tne gang
toward the mountains. They made seve
ra^sorties while we were there an dkept
tUe city in constant terror."
From a Guayaquil nev\<paper it was ap
parent that the war teeiitu: was at fever
heat just before the tire. One advertise
ment revealed this particularly. It was
dated at a little town near Guayaquil, and
said :
"1, Eusebio Villandon de Copay, will
pay any man 10,000 sucres (about % 5000)
lor the head of the infamous Alejandro
Rotates, now with me iHameless violators
of their country."
It was related that thp rebel bad led a
small party that visited the country estate
of Villand in and despoiled his household.
"Now tiiat the ruthless vet insignificant
rebels have been driven like r^ts into the
confines of the iranta Anas," said one
newspaper, "let them be pursued with
diligence and killed without mercy or
quarter. It is enougb that our beloved
country should bave harbored such
wretches without being called upon to
endure tneir further existence within her
borders. L,et the de-str yers of our coun
try's honor ba wiped out as a foul stain of
blood froni a glittering blade. Praise to
the undaunted general, Enr.que Gailardo,
who pursues the villain Nunez aod his
deformed crew."
The Wild Swan mailed from Guayaquil
on November 3, and nad excellent weatner
all the way up, except for the past two
days, when the tail end of the northern
gale wus struck. This caused the steamer
to battle asain.it a strong head wind into
San Diego. After taking on coal here it
will proceed to Esquimau.
Ban Pedro-Smn liiego Steamer*.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Nov. 27.â A proposi
tion was made to-day to the Chamber of
Commerce by M. D. Adams of this city,
representing San Diego and Los Angeles
persons, looking toward the establishment
of a fcniall steamer line between San
Pedro and this port. The object is
to afford competition against the
Southern Cali.ornia Railway, which
is alleged to discriminate against San
Diego in the matter of tourist travel dur
ing tbe winter month', when the travel is
Heaviest. It is proposed by the new com
pany to put on a comfortable passenger
steamer and make a rate of $1 either way,
making three trips per week. This plan
was tried two years ago, and did not prove
an entire success, but the poor accommo
dations of the steamer were given as the
cause.
The Â»Â»ino Murder Trial.
FREBNO, Cal., Nov. 27.â The trial of
Indian Jake for the murder of his two
year-old stepson was continued in Judge
Church's court to-t'ay and the introduc
tion of testimony was noisned.
The prosecution offered no evidence as
to the motive of the killing. One squaw
who was sitting inside of the house heard
a shot, followed by an oath from the de
fendant. Another who witnessed the
shooting tesified that Jake did not swear.
The testimony was very unsatisfactory,
the witnesses contradicting themselves
continually. The case will be given to the
}ury to-morrow, and there is little doubt
that the defendant will be acquited.

No More Deep-Sea Service for the

PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., Nov. 27.â
The United States Revenue Survey Board
fiuished its labors here last evening. The
days of usefulness of the old cutter Wal
cott are over a* far as active service is con
cerned. Twenty-six years of continuous
service has been the portion of the Wal
cott, until now it is deemed tnat she is not
fit fof any more outside service.
The future details of the Walcott will be
within pleasant harbors, and she will be
looked upou as the cutter wilh all the
comforts of a home.
it is understood that all repairs to the
cutters Bear and Grant will be made at
Seattle* It was said some weeks ago tnat
the Dad condition of the boners of the
Bear would necessitate her going to San
Francisco, but this has been found un
necessary. Upon the completion oi her
repairs the Bear wiil make her headquar
ters at Seattle.
The Grant, after coming from the ma
chinists' hands, will be headquartered
here, as will also the Walcott. tine may
become a permanent fixture here at the
port of entry.
Chief Engineer Doyle will have his
headquarters at San Francisco during the
winter, nd in the spring will proceed,
aboard one of the cutters, probably the
Cor win, to Unalaska, where he will mane
his headquarters ashore under the special
detail as chief engineer oi the fleet.

MURDER ENDS A
MARRIAGE FEAST
An Assassin Fires Upon a
Ritzville Wedding
Party.
One of the Bridesmaids Fatally
Wounded by a Charge of
Buckshot.
Suspicion Points to a R j;cted Suitor,
Who Sought to Kill the
Bride.
SPOKANE, Wash., Nov. 27.-The fes
tivities following the marriage of Henry
Oxshire and Miss Anloof, near Ritaville,
Wash., last night, were suddenly termi
nated by an awful tragedy.
While the guests were seated around
the banqnet table the report of a gun was
heard; a charg* of buckshot shattered a
window and Miss Ida liauers, one of the
bridesmaids, fell from her chair to tbe
floor, where she iay moaning, while blood
flowed from a dozen wounds In her head.
The scene of revelry suddenly changed
to one of wildest excitement. Horror
stricken guests rushed to the side of tbe
unfortunate woman, who was lifted up
tenderly and borne to a coach in an inner
room.
While some of the gentlemen hastened
to town for a physician, the others began
a search of tbe vicinity for the would-be
assassin, but although they did not relin
quish the bunt until daylight they failed
to find any oue toward whom suspicion
might point.
When a doctor at last arrived Miss
Bauers was seemingly in a dying condi
tion. Her nose bad been thot away, a
portion of her left ear bung by ( a thread,
two shots baa entered her left eye and
three bad furrowed seams across her scalp.
The young woman swooned soon
after she bad been picked up from the
floor, and at latest accounts had not re
covered consciousness. The physician in
attendance says there is no hope for her
recovery.
It is believed that the fiendish crime was
committed by a rejected suitor for the
hand of the bride.
The theory is tbat he fired at his success
ful rival's wife, but either his aim was bad
or he mistook Miss Bauers for his in
tended victim. Since tbe tragedy this
man has been missing and no trace of him
can bs found. The people of R.tzvilie are
enraged to the point of frenzy, and if the
wretch is captured hie liie would not be
worth a farthing.

IN PRISON WITHOUT CAUSE.
An Acquitted Prisoner Held Awaiting
Judge Welborn's Recovery From
Illness.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Nov. 27.âBÂ£cir
cumstances unprovided for by the United
States statutes Wong Fong, a Chinese, has
been kept a prisoner in the County Jail
seven weeks after the United States
Supreme Court decided he should bave
his liberty. About ten months ago Wong
was arreste â¢}, charged with being unlaw
fully in this country. He was examined
by United States otlioia ls nereand ordered
deported. He appealed the case to the
Supreme Court.
Since his arrest Wong has been confined
in the County Jail, where United States
prisoners are kept. With characteristic
slowness no motion was made Jn Wong's
cÂ«se until seven weeks ago, when the court
decided he should not be taken back to
China, as he had a perfect right in this
country. One other process remained be
fore Wong could obrain his liberty, and
that was for United States District Judge
Welborn to sign in open court the order
for his release.
Judge Welborn has been ill for the past
two months and unable to bold court, so
Wong has had to chafe in the County Jail
on account of this technicality. He will
have to wait until Judge Welborn opens
court again and signs the order. Wong
threatens to sue the United Stales for
damages.

TRIAL OF WHITAER ATTACHES.
Only One Juror su-om Out of a Venire
nf Forty- Eight.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Nov. 27. -Great
difficulty is being experienced in securing
a jury in Justice Young's court to try
Superintendent John Cofrin, Mrs. Ellen
J. Wilson, Miss Germain and Miss Hen
derson on charges of having committed
battery on Grace Maroney aid other fe
male inmates of Whittier Reform School
by whipping them with leather straps
and otherwise abusing them. Out of a
venire of forty-eifht, only one man could
be found to sit on the jury. All expressed
themselves as being opposed to whipping
girl inmates of the school.
Throu.-li some mistake no venire had
been issued, and Justice Young had to
start deputies out th s morning. This
accounts for the small number of men
brought to be examined. The cane was
continued until Tue^day, when a sufficient
number of men wiil be in attendance to
secure most of the jury. The case will
be bitterly fought at every point. Di trict
Attorney Donnell has " charee of the
prosecution in person. W. E. Arthur ap

Tramps for Ten Days Over the
Mountains Without Tasting
Food.
PORTLAND. OR., Nov. 27. âA- O.
Mechlingof Sauk was taken to the hos
pital in Sedro, Snohomish County, on
Tuesday. He was nearly exhausted and
both of his feet were badly frostbitten.
He told a story of horrible suffering, hav
ing been forced to witness the death of a
companion from lreezinjt on the moun
tain side while he was powerless to allevi
ate the dying man's distress. Mechling
for ten days face l a similar fate, having
durinsr that time not tasted a mouthful of
food. He finally reached the camp of
friendly Indians, where he was cared for.
Mechiing and George A. Pierce had
established a camp and provisioned it for
the winter, seven miles northwest of
Glazier Peak, where they expected to spend
the season hunting and trapping. Tney
came out at election time and voted, and
tbe next day Pierce started back, while
Mechling carried the ballots of Sauk
Precinct to Mount Vernon. Mechling
strapped on his pack on November 7 and
started to overtake Pierce, coming up with
him on the alternoon of November 10 well
up to the top of the mountain, it had
been snowing bard for several hours and
Mechling estimated the fall at about ten
feet. When Mechling reached Pierce he
found him exhausted and frostbitten. His
companion refused to go another step.
Persuasion was useless. He worked with
Pierce until 11 o'clock, when he left him
dead in the snow.
Mechling started on toward camp.which
was only one and a half miles distant,
reaching it the next morning at 8 o'clock.
To tiis surprise and discouragement he
found that tbe camp had been burned
during their absence.
The difficulties now to be encountered
would bave struck terror to any man with
'ess nerve and endurance than Mechling.
He could not retrace his steps on account
of tbe deep snow. He had left his pack,
his camp was burned and consequently he
had neither blankets nor food.
Undaunted he started out on another
divide, and after ten days' travel without
food or blankets reached n Siwash camp
twenty-six miles up the Suattle River on
November 21. Tbe Indians helped him to
Sauk on November 22, and he was brought
down tbr Ska-.rit in a canoe to the hospital
on November 23. The surgeons are unable
to stase what will be the result of Mech
iinc's exiosure.
A year a.'O Mechling, in a flgnt with a
bear, was severely torn, and lay in Provi
dence Hospital in Seattle for some time.

TRIED MANY REMEDIES.
Pains's Celery Compound Was the
Only One That Succeeded.
The essential difference between Paine's
celery compound and the bewildering
number of sarsaparillas and nervines that
its success has brought into existence is
that Paine's celery compound furnishes
just the appropriate nutriment to the
exhausted nerves and securely builds up
the system against disease, while the un-
scientific remedies confuse and add to the
derangement of the organs.
Paine's celery compound not only re-
lieves but effectively and permanently
cures.
The most permanent and direct cure for
debility, nervous weakness, languor and a
"run-down" condition is the strong, reli-
able Paine's celery compound. The rasp-
ing, irriiating effect of a badly nourished
nervous system upon all the organs of the
body ceases when this medicine is used.
Paine's celery compound is the most
advanced nerve and brain strengtbener
and restorer known to meilical science.
Th<Â» tired, worn-out sufferer who is not
advancing toward health is falling back.
There is no standstill in bad health. One
can endure a headache or a backache once;
one can endure it twice, but the repeated
sick headache and the constant pain in
the back and in the rpgion of tne heart
must be got rid of. F.r the permanent
and posit ye cure o? these unhealthy states
of the body, as evinced by repeated attacks
of rheumatism, neuralgia, sleeplessness <>r

Paine's celery compound.
If you are out of health or despondent
because of repeated trials of other reme-
dies take a fresh start. The bracing
weather U in your favor.
Here is the experience â If-'a tbatof hun-
dreds of others â of Mrs. Lydia M. Hayden
of Marion, Ind. :
"Before commencing tho use of Paine's
celery compound I was treated by many
doctors and tried many remedies, but did
not get any be ter. I seemed to be all
broken down. I was tired all the time
and my constitution ceemed to be giving
out. I weighed only 115 pounds last fall
when I commenced using Paine's celery
compound. In less than two months I
weighed 124 pounds, an unusual weight
for me. I have bad better health ever
Â«ince, and have felt better this summer
than I have for years. ,
"My little daughter was away from
home on a visit and came home looking
as if she had had a hard sickness. I went
right away and got her a bottle of Paine's
celery compound, and she ha** had better
health since tiian she ever had in her life,
eata hearty and is crowing fast."
There is no woman who. In justice to
herself, can fail to take Paine's celery
compound under similar clrcumÂ«tances.

THROUGH .TRAINS.BECOMES OWNER
OF ALL JUNEAU
The Alaska Town Site Now
in the Possession of
One Man.
Declared to Be His by Right of
a Mineral Claim Filed
Years Ago.
Had Relinquished His P. pers to
Escape Lynching at the Hands
of Citizens.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., Nov. 27.â
Eieht years of litigation, during the
progress of which one of the principals
had a narow escape from being lynched by
' a mob, has just been terminated, and the
- man who almost lost his life because he
upheld his rights is vow tbe owner of the
â¢ greater part of the flourishing town of
Juneau, Alaska. His claim, as approved
by tbe United States Land Office, gives
him title to all the business and a greater
: part of the residence portion of the grow
. ing settlement.
It was in 1886, after several others had
filed and abandoned, that A. A. Goldstein,
' a prominent merchant, located on a mm.
. eral claim which included nearly the
whole of the present site of Juneau.
' More than the necessary amount of
assessment work was done to secure the
- patent, and when two years late a regular
â¢ application for a patent was made the
citizens awoke to the importance of the
matter and began a concerted movement
to kill it
In November, 1888, a mass-meeting was
held, attended by 300 citizens of Juneau.
Goldstein was brought by force before this
meeting, where a demand that he aban
don the claim .was made. This he refused
to do, but agreed, in the event of securing
" a patent, to deed, free of charge, to actual
. occupants, all property improved or held
by them. The offer was declined with the
threat that if Goldstein did not at once
abandon tbe land and give up his papers
he would be lynched. To save his life
Goldstein agreed and did turn over the
official documents, demanding only to
â  know who received them. United States
Commissioner (now Marshal) Willsans
and W F. Reid were appointed a commit
tee to accept them, and since that time all
â¢ efforts to find the documents have failed.
Goldstein's assertion that he would
secure justice if possible was met by
threats against his life, but he hired an
attorney and prepared for the struggle.
The citizens elected a trustee and applied
for a town site patent. To the granting of
this Goldstein objected. The case was
heard before the local Land Office at
Sitka and was decided against Goldstein,
lmmt diately an appeal was taken to the
General Land Office at Washington City,
where, after dragging along for over a
year, it lias finally been decided, accord
ing to private advices, in favor of Gold
stein.
During the time the litigation has been
in progress the fireat mining discoveries in
ana about Juneau have populated and pros
pered the piace until to-day Goldstein's
holdings are worth, at the lowest estimate,
a half-million dollars. The greatest ex
citement prevailed in Juneau upon the re
ceipt of the decision. While it will be of
great advantage to Goldstein, it consti
tutes a blow from which it will require
years for the business interests to recover.
â¢In connection with tbe case Goldstein
now has pending suits for damages against
Williams and Reid and against Orville T.
.Porter, ex-officio Surveyor-General, who
refused to turn over a copy of the official
papers on hie in his office.
FOX HUNTING IN
SAN MATEO COUNTY
A Pack of Hounds Coining
' j From the East With
Foxes.
. Burlingame Club Organizing
.. the San Mateo Hunting
Club.
A shadow has fallen upon the San Rafael
paper chase. The sport is to be eclipsed
so that horsemen with any regard for their
reputation as such will have to look upon
' chasing trails of shredded paper as so much
child's play. Then of course it will be
beneath the dignity of the fortunate pos
sessor of high bred hunters, and naturally
all the rest who follow them, to seriously
Beauties of the Pack as They Will Appear at tar i~ig*mu
regard it in the nature ot country sport.
Instead of paper hares and trails across
the fields the bay of the hounds will coon
be heard and the "piping horn," and
above ail else wiil ring out the cry remind
ful of crisp frosty days "tallyho! tallyho!"
For California is to have its pack of
English foxhounds, and the San Mateo
hills are to be stocked with genuine Eng
lish foxes. And soon the rivalry among
gentlemen who follow the hounds will be
largely confined to capturing the "brush,"
or to be particular where this term may
appear technical, the tail of the fox.
After that will come the struggle for foxes'
beads to decorate the staliÃ of winning
horses.
Burlingame will then be strictly in good
iorrn. It will have its red coats, its whip
per-in, its master; and San Mateo County
its red coated fox-hunting squires. This
will be truly English, you know, bui to be
au fait nowadays, such things are neces
sary. The good old sport will be the fad
of Burlingame, and already it has given
new life to that aristocratic club within
tlie exclusive precincts of which fox
hunting has become the favorite topic of
conversation. On the polo ground
between innings members discuss hounds
and foxes with the ladies, at dinners they
talk about five-barreJ gates, and the fair
ones sigh for stone fences and trim hedge
rows wbi.e reconciling themselves with
ordinary California cow fences ani the
like.
Even now there is a pack of fox
hounds on the way from N<-w York, where
the dogs were bought by WalterS. Hobart.
They were shipped by rail Wednesday
last and are expected to arrive here in the
course of a week. The pack consists of
nineteen pairs, or thirty-eigtit hounds in
all. The kennel will be at San Mateo,
whence the first nunt will start as soon as
the dogs are well rested after their trip
across the continent.
With them, though in another train, a
goodly supply of English red foxes is b ing
hurried toward California. They will be
set free in a large inclosure back toward
the foothills be.md the town of San
Mateo and left there to increase in num
bers.
For the present, at least during this
season, th â  fox will not be hunted, for the
reason that tbe number must first be
materially increased beiore any of them
are set at liberty in the hills. That will
not be until the following hunting season,
but there will be royal sport after Keynard
through the mesa lands and the rolling
foothills down the peninsula. And all the
bunterÃ will have a merry time in trying
to get in tir-t at the death.
Until that time bags of aniseed will be
used to furnish the sport. This method of
making a trail for hounds is known as a
drag huut. A horseman rides away ahead
draggine a bag of aniseed over the ground.
It is part of his performance to imitate
the cunning fox. He must go back on his
trail and use such sly tricks to throw the
hounds off the scent. At a given time the
bounds are let loose. Then they nick up
the scent and away they go, the pack bay
ing and flying v/ith noses to the ground
and tbe hunters at their heels, riding for
all that is in them over drains and over
fences and everywhere, if they don't wish
to lose caste, the hounds go. At last the
end of the trail is reached, ami the first
hunter to arrive wins the first honor.
Through the energies of some members
of the Burlingame Club a hunt club is be
ing organized. This will be an indepen
dent organization to be cal.ed the San
Mateo Hunting Club. It will select a
master of the hounds and the whipper-in.
Ladies can become members, so that tney
will now have an opportunity of this mag
nificent country sport, and in addition
to that their presence will make it de
cidedly popular. Horsemen say that the
new rivalry which fox-hunting will create
will improve the quality of hunting horses
in California.
COST OF USING GUNS.
Heavy expenditures Incurred in the
British -Navy.
The days are long past when we Eng
lishmen sang in a free and easy way:
Two jolly Frenchmen and one Porxugee,
One jolly Englishman could lick them all three.
We are ready enough now to give our
possible adversaries all credit for pluck,
and perhaps for technical skill, and yet,
as regards practice in the use of their
weapons, we still have them at an im
measurable disadvantage. This factor is
commonly omitted from newspaper com
parisons, but it would probably have more
weight than any other in determining the
issue of an actual struggle. Two dueli-ts
may each have lion hearts and each the
best Damascus blades, but if one has ten
times more practice in the art of fencing
than the other, it is long odds that he will
win.
So it is with our navy. It has a far
greater knowledge of ships, acquired by
actual maneuvering at sea, and a far
greater knowledge of guns, acquired by
actual firing practice.than any other power.
And the reason of this i? precisely because
such knowledge is a very expensive thing
to acquire and England is the only nation
that cares to afford it.
It iE probable that where France (the
next naval power) spends one million in
sea-cruising and gun-firing we spend five.
From every gun in our navy having a
caliber of ten inches and under there are
fired each quarter eight rounds of ammu
nition by way of practice and from all
guns heavier than the ten-inch four rounds
a quarter, irrespective of the additional
rounds used in the annual "prize-firing."
The heavy expenditure involved in this
item alone may be hinted at by observing
that every full raund fired from a six-inch
gun cost Â£16. from an eight-inch gun Â£30,
from a 12-inch gun Â£123, ami from the
16.25-inch or 110-ton gun as mucu as Â£300.
And these figures are only a small part of
the story, for the life of a very heavy gun
is not a long one, and though a six-inch
gun can fire as many a? 500 rounds, sev
enty or eighty full rounds arc the limit of
the 110 ton ; after firing that amount they
will both require a new inner tube, a costly
matter enough. â Chambers Journal.
Cycling is a pastime on which the sun
never sets. Even Japan has caught the
craze; the only great drawback is that,
except in Yokohama and Tokio, the roads
are terribly bad all over tbe country, being
very narrow and full of deep ruts.
There are forty-eight distinct diseases
of the eye. No other organ of tbe human
body has so many.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 28, 1896.
MERCHANTS WHO
ARE PROGRESSIVE
Streets Which Will Be
Made Attractive for
Commerce.
The Go* Ahead Success of the
M.ssioo and Richmond to
Be Emulated.
Polk, Larkin and S zth to Be Brought
Into Active Ccmp?tition With
Market Street
Market, Kearny and other downtown
streets, which heretofore had a monopoly
of the business transacted in the retail
trj.de, will ere long have, in the language
of the street, "to get a move on to them
selves" if they wish to retain the prestige
which was theirs for a number of years.
The first outside business street to wake
up to the age]of progress and improvement
was Polk, whose property-owners and
business men created no small boom a few
weeks ago by having that thoroughfare
lighted by a series of electric arc lamps
from Sutter street to Vallejo. With a reg
ular whoopup of music and red lights on
a recent Saturday evening they convinced
the people of the Western Addition that
Polk street had some public-spirited mer
chants on its line. Since that time busi
ness has improved over 20 per cent.
This condition of affairs so encouraged
the property-owners and merchants that
the "huniD" which blockaded the north
ern end of that street from Greenwich to
Lombard will be removed as fast as men,
I horses and money can be made to accom
plish the work. So progressive have they
been that the engineers are now preparing
plans for street levels and other matters
to give an outlet to the street to its north
ern limit.
Larkin street from Sutter to Market has
caught the contagious fever of improve
ment and progress to such an extent that
Dr. Hill and other businessmen and prop
erty-owners nave formulated a call for a
meeting of those interested in the scheme
to meet at an early date next week, when
steps will be taken to give this street an
impetus on the progressive scale. Elec
tric 111 his will illuminate this thorough
fare over its length as above mentioned,
and in addition to this the 6x4-pane win
dows, with the pioneer semblance of some
country village where the ends of houses
are made to face the streets, will give
place to full fronts, with plate-glass show
windows Â»nd other modern inventions,
which is a change that removes the ap
pearance of decay and dry rot from old
houses and makes them lootc like new.
Last but not least comes Sixth street,
where the same spirit of progress has
seized the men who own property and the
merchants who rent the stores for busi
ness of commerce.
This will, it is expected, one week
from to-day be transformed from a half
lighted place at night to one of splendor
and brilliancy. There will be no less than
eighteen arc lights placed in the center of
the street from Market to Folsom. These
will be so distributed that they will be
placed in front of the small streets which
open into the main one and which here
tofore have been so dimiy lighted Dy an
occasional and stray lamp as to make
it both dark and dangerous to enter any of
them after sundown.
The property-owners and business men
on this street have with but very few ex
ceptions responded most cheerfully to the
call of progress, so that sufficient money
to liuht up had been subscribed inside of
twenty-four hours after the movement
had been fairly started.
The few picayunish property-owners,
who declined to get into the van, will be
noted, and if their stores do not have con
stant and permanent tenants they may
find out that to live in Rome one must do
as Rome does.
The hitch that seemed to exist between
the two electric light companies in sup
plying the required illumination has had
something to do with retarding the work
on Larkin and Sixth streets. But so far
as the latter street is concerned the com
mittee having this branc . of progress in
hand has succeeded in getting concessions
which are satisfactory and which will con
tinue to enable the contributors to keep
the street illuminated continuously.
The same terms will, in all probability,
be made with Larkin street, and Polk
street will, woen the present contract ex
pires ai the end o: four months, obtain
similar conditions, which consist ot $1 75
per lamp per week, whereas at present the
price is $3 a week.
Flllmore In ths Van.
The business men on Fillmore street
have caught the improvement boom and
at a meeting held in Franklin Hail last
night organized an improvement club and
elected John G. Waibel temporary presi
dent and V. V. Cross secretary.
Committees on permanent organization
and plans of improvement were appointed.
It is the desire of the property-owners and
merchants on this street to follow in the
footsteps of Polk and other business
streets in this City which haye already
carried into effect a general system of im
provement.
Fillmore street, between Sutter and
Washington, has for quite a number of
years assumed a commercial aspect, but
arc lights will give it a new impetus into
modern activity.
TALMUD AND TESTAMENT.
Rabbi Nieto Drawn Interesting I'aral
leli on Humility as Described
in Both Books.
Rabbi Nleto lectured last evening in the
Taylor-street synagogue on "Humility, as De
scribed in the Talmud and New Testament."
He said:
"The overbearing disposition with which
the popular Ctiristian mind had Invested the
Pharisee is one of those fallacies which the
world, even in this enlightened age, accepts
without question. To state, even to educated
men, that this is an error involving great
injustice to a people and the descendants of
that people, one would obtain tor the state
ment as much credence as he would for say
ing that the Tower of Babel was not built to
avoid destruction by a deluge. Yet Is this
statement true. How it came to be a belief
that the tower was erected to escape flood
personally I cannot tell.
"The Bible makes the plain statement that
the people, averse to being scattered, arected a
grand lortress in which they intended to live
In just such Inexplicable manner has it be^
come the fashion to regard the Pharisee as the
embodiment of all that is vain, haughty aid
unbending. Were tbis indeed so It would
most naturally reflect discredit upon that sect
of Jews; but that unmerited contempt has
been meted out to the Pharisee can be shown
by a reference to the history of the period pre
ceding and continuing through the life of
Jesus.
"That humility and modesty were held to be
the highest ideals of human conduct by the
teachers of ancient Israel the Talmud and He
brew literature abundantly prove, and many
were the tales and maxims used by them to
impress the practice of 'numility' upon all.
"In the Gospel of Mark it is 'those that
humble themselves who shall be exalted.' In
the Talmud tractate Erubin it says: 'Be
lowly; whoever humbles himself shad be
exalted, and whoever exalts himself shall be
humbled.' And, further, In Berachotb: 'Who
ever makes naught of himself here shall be
glorified hereafter.'
"According to both the New Testament and
the Talmud the humble are to be the princi
pal inhabitants of the future world. 'Happy
are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.'
Also, 'Happy are the poor in spirit, for they
shall inherit the kingdom of heaven.' "
BANNISTER'S BAD FAILURE.
Hit Aaaets Am Nothing and Liabilities
Are Quite Heavy.
The failure of Alfred Bannister, who
was formerly a partner of A. D. Starr,
deceased, in the Star Milling Company,
appears to be complete.
Mr. fiannister has filed a petition in
insolvency, in which he states his total
assets to be $500 worth of household
effects. These are exempt from execution.
His debts aggregate $23,628. Notes
amountng to $10,600 are held by a local
bank. He has other quite large creditors,
one of whom, Ci>arles Gardiner of London,
has a claim of $5885. G. W. Bannister of
Ireland is also a creditor to the amount of
$2400. One of his largest creditors in this
City is J. Feaso, to whom he owes $1200.
STORIES ABOUT WELLINGTON.
How the Great Soldier Admitted a
Piece of Injustice.
In a paper on Assye and Wellington a
contributor to The Cornhill tells these
stories about the Iron Duke:
During the last few weeks of the life of
the second Duke of Wellington, up to
witbin a few days of his very sudden
death, I, happening to be living in the
neighborhood of Strathfieldsaye, spent
almost every day and many hours in long
talks, ohiefiy in the grounds of the park,
with the Duke. He, knowing that the
one subject on which I wanted to get him
to talk was his father, most kindly in
dulged me by devoting his conversation
to him. 1 think 1 may 6ay that it was a
relief to him to do so.
For the fact was that he was burdened
by a sense ot responsibility. He was fulj
of stories and anecdotes of the great man
whose heir be was. He had been con
tinually pressed by many, by Lord
Wolseley, and by me perhaps more than
by any one else, to give to the world all
that he could tell of his fathei. He could
neither altogether make up his mind to
go to his grave burying all record of the
past, nor yet, as he appealed to me again
and again to agree with him, coulu he
feel that the stones of domestic life which
he had to tell were altogether such as a
son would willingly give to the world of a
great father. In fact he felt, 1 think, that
some day or other they ought to be
known, but he wanted to leave to some
one else the responsibility of telling them.
In reality I do not think that they much
alter one's impression of the man. But
perhaps the fact that Dr. Gleig went to his
grave knowing all such stories well and
never gave them forth, and that it is
twelve years since I first heard them, and
that, though often pressed to do so, 1 have
never used the freedom which was entirely
left to me in regard to them, will indicate
that they have -eemed to many out of
tune with the sort of conception of the
man which one knows to be popular and
half hesitates to disturb, lest in dispersing
the cloudy vision one should blur the true
grandeur of the face. In fact, they are all
stories of a strong, hard man â harder on
himself than on any one else â and, being
chiefly ot his later life, apply to a time
when thes â¢ characteristics had become set
and rigid. Here, at all events, are a few
specimens, for good or bad:
During his campaigns the Duke had
acquired a peculiar habit in regard to
sleep. No noise, not the discharge of the
loudest cannonade or an explosion, would
wake him; but the most delicate touch,
even on his clothes, roused him instant ly.
When roused there was no moment of
semi-somnolence, of eye-rubbing or blurred
consciousness as to where he was or what
had happened. Out of the deadest sleep
he was instantly in the possession of all
his faculties. NjW, whether it was a de
termination not to yield to advancing
years or merely the habit of a lifetime it
would be difficult to say; but during all
the time when c was living as a country
gentleman at Strathtieldsaye there was
nothing ttiat he resented so much as the
attempt of any one in his household or out
of it to do him any personal service.
Numbers of the anecdotes turn on thus
peculiarity.
He had made for him a specially con
structed tandem. It had two spats at the
back and was completely covered in, the
whole front being of glass. The reins
ra^srd unuer the glass casing in front,
n this way the Duke himself drove two
very fine horses. One day his second bou,
Lord Charles Wellesley, "was sitting with
*ni in this carriage. The Duke, as in
later life he often on various occasions
did, fell fast asleep, stili holding the reins.
The spirited horses soon felt the loss of
control. Before lone Lord Charles, anx
iously watching the situation, saw that in
another moment the leader would dash
up a steep bank and that his father's life
and his own would be in imminent dan
ger. The risk was too great to run,
though he knew his father too well not to
be aware that any interference with him
as the driver of the horses would be bit
terly resented.
As quietly as he could do so, he slipped
his hand over the rein, drew down the
leader from the bank, and .Â«-aved them
both from a catastrophe, anxiously en
deavoring not to wake his father in doing
so. It was useless, however. Light as
bis touch had been ttie great Duke was
instantly awake, and fully alive to all that
had happened.
"What are you doing. Charles?"
"I only turned off tne leader, sir, from
the bank. He was just running up it, and
we should have been upset."
"Mmd your own business, Charles!
mind your own business!" was all the
thanks he ever received.
The same son, Lord Charles, had been
on leave in either Spain or Italy. He had
met with a series of accidents on iÂ» is re
turn journey, had been in very serious
clanger, and, though he had made the ut
most effort to do so, had failed to get back
in time.
His father asked for no explanation and
would near none. He treated him as a
convicted culprit, refused to have any
intercourse with him, and in various ways
made him feel his displeasure. One day
a visitor to Stratbtieldsave drew out from
Lord Charles an account of his journey.
The Duke listened, and when tne story
came to an end he w?nt up to his son:
"So, Charles, you met with an acci
dent?"
"Yes, father."
"And you did all you could to be back
in time?"
"Yes, father."
"Well, I'll give you a horse, Charles;
I'll give you ahorse."
It was the only form in which he admit
ted the injustice of which he was clearly
conscious.
A Curious Story.
I came across a curious story of Field
Marshal Joseph Sabine in the current
number of "Good Words." It is so curi
ous that I venture to give it to my readers
as it is told by Mr. Baring-Gould, who is,
I fancy, his godson. General Babme was
in the battle of Ramillies in 1706, when he
lost the signet ring off bis left hand.
Joseph had been a third son; accordingly
he had borne on his arms a mullet tor a
difference. But owing to the death of his
elder brothers he came to be the represen
tative of his family, and accordingly, with
the point ot his inife, he dug out the
mullet.
A century and a quarter after this, his
preat-Rrandson, Edward Sabine, was trav
eling in Belgium with bis wife, and vis
ited Tirlemont and the battlefield of Ra
millies, when, hsppening to look into the
window of a little local watchmaker, he
wai surprised and delighted to see a ring
with his own arms on itâ in fact, the very
rin* lost by bis ancestor, fie at once se
cured it, and the ring is now in the pos
session of the family.â London Sketch.
No human head was impressed on coins
until alter the death of Alexander the
Groat. All images before that time were
of deities.

HEENAN'S GLOVE IN THE KING.
Isidor J cobs, Reed and Heenan Will
Be No L nger W lcome to Sit
by the Council Fire.
The Iroquois Club purged itself of dis
loyalty last night by expelling Isidor
Jacobs in accordance with the report of
the committee which found him guilty of
having outraged the shades of Jackson
and Jefferson by voting for McKinley and
Hobart.
The club also listened in amazement
and indignation to a document read by
Charles Wesley Reed, in which he scari
fied the club and its members until Max
Popper crew pale and J. J. Flynn got as
red in the face as a genuine Iroquois on
the warpath. Mr. Reed's document read
in this wi^e:
To the Officers and Members of the IroquoU
Clubâ Gentlemen : 1 herewith tender my
resignation us a member ol the Iroquois Club,
not because of the resolution requesting all
members who opposed the Chicago plattorm
to resign, bui becau c I do not desire to be a
member of a club proiesslng the principles of
Jefferson and yet repudiating all that he held
most sacred.
At the last meeting of the club I was charged
with treachery to Democratic principles be
cause I nad opposed the Chicago platform. In
my defense I whs proceeding to prove that the
Chicago platform waa opposed to Democratic
principles and tne constitution oi the club
when a point of order was made that, inas
much as the Chicago p attorn was the em
bodiment ot Democratic principles and had
received the support of the club, any argu
ment tending to prove that the Chicago plat
form was undemocratic and inconsistent with
the constitution oi the club was out of order.
De-pite the facr that the articles of Incor
poration of the club were filed with the Secre
tary of State years ago, and Democratic prin
ciples were crystallized nearly a century before
the Chicago pi atform startled the country, tue
chair sustained the point by an anaicnistlc
ruling in keeDing with the Chicago platform.
It is needless to say tnat the club sustained
the chair. It was stated frankly that the last
regu:ar Democratic National Convention was
the infallible judge oi Democratic principles
and that no onÂ» could be a Democrat who did
not loyally support that convention's declara
tion ol principles, no matter how much be was
opposed to the platform and no matter what
the principles of the party had previously
bi-ei;. S'.icii a confession of total depravity was
never beiore made by a political organization
above a piece club.
M x Popper, who brought in the resolution,
has made many speeches within the year in
support of the gold standard, declaring free
coinage meant National dishonor and National
disaster.
It was eminently proper, in view of the tem
per ol the club, that he, of all men, should
propose to read Democrats out uf the party for
voting uhe believed. Mr. Popper's peculiar
tituess for the task was enhanced by tne fact
that, he had bolted the Democr&tic Municipal
Convention, after having secured the passage
by the club of a resolution that the t>eneral
Comiaittee which appointed the conveution
was the only regular Democratic organization
in this City and County.
The resolution requesting the resignation of
the gold Democrats who voted as they be
lieved was supported vigorously by ail of the
Chronic Buckley bolters, whose souls were
harrowed at me thought of bolting for any
thing but jobs. It was also supported by all
but *hree or four of the members who had
previously howled for Cleveland, and had de
clared that his financial policy was the szlva
tion of the country. The club, I believe, in
tends to square itself on its Cleveland record
by turning his picture to the wall after the 4th
of March, and expelling W. D. English, when
the power of those Democrats to do violence to
the principles of the club, by removing its
members from office, has ceased.
Some groans and a few short dry laughs
greeted Mr. Reed at this point." Chair
man Gitdea rapped the club to order,
after having firet cast an apprehensive
glance at the oil portrait of General Jack
son on tae wall.
Then Mr. Reed, holding his typewritten
resolution in his left hand and buryine
his rijtu hand in his pistol-pocket, pro
ceeded to read s. comparison between the
Chicago platform and the principles
enunciated by Mr. Jefferson. Then he
proceeded :
The Democratic pertv in California is a gold
party. Between 35,000 and 45,000 Democrats
voted for McKinley. The Democratic State
Central Committee Is made up of gold Demo
crats because they could not find enough
silver Democrats who knew how to conduct a
campaign to fill out the committee. Natio<iaJ
Commiiteeman Dwyer, less than a month be
fore he went to Chicago, was the most belliger
ent goldbug on the coast. He said that "if a
free-siiver House, a free-silver Senate and a
free-silver President were elected, still no
free-coinage bill would be passed, because (be
people of the United States wou^d not allow
the perpetration of such insane folly." â¢ â¢ â¢
The gag rule adopted by the club shuts off
all discussion. If there was a chance of a fair
fight â or a fight of any kindâ l would still
battle for the gold standard.no matter now
many cnampions appeared under the leader
ship of Tillman. Altgeld, "Bill" Stewart and
Sf.muel Braunhart. To remain under present
couditions would be to proc aim myself a
Democrat for revenue and a patriot for place,
but I have not yet adopted the new Democracy
proclaimed by the Iroquois Club. Respect
fully submitted, Charles Wesley Reed.
When Mr. Reed mentioned the name of
Bryan the club rose to its feet and gave
three genuine war whoops.
At the conclusion of the reading Fred
Raabe moved to accept the resignation
"because Mr. Reed had attempted to give
the ciub a black eye."
"You called me a traitor and a rene
gade last Friday night," said Mr. Reed to
the club generally.
-That's what you are," replied J. J.
Flynn, cheerily.
Flynn thereupon proceeded to say that
the communication was an insult to the
club, to each individual thereof and to the
party. The proper thing to do would be
to expel Mr. Reed. He said that Reed
had never been a Democrat. He had ac
cepted what the organization bad done
and then did not vote for the ticket. He
had accepted office as a Democrat.
Mr. Cabaniss denounced the paper as a
screed. It bad made his Democratic blood
boil in his veins.
Max Popper made a lengthy speech, in
which he said that he had been a Demo
crat since 1864 and that Reed had been in
the party for only four years. He referred
to the fact that Reed had supported Judge
Magufre, Senator White, James V. Cole
man and other silver Democrats.
After an acrimonious discussion, which
was all one war, the club declined to ac
cept Mr. Reed's resignation and it was re
solved to draw up the necessary charges
against him in order that be might be
legally expelled.
Mr. Reed left the hall amid derisive
crins.
John Heenan was the next member to
harrow the feelings of the club. His com
munication was read as follows:
In answer to your resolution of last Friday
requesting all those wbo supported Palmer
an: Buckner lo ret-ign, allow me to reply that
I refuse to resign and request the club at the
earliest moment to proceed with my expul
sion in the formal way laid down in the by
laws. A copy of the charges and the notice of
expulsion by the club will be in my political
career a most valuable document.
To enable your committee to prepare specifi
cations and charges I avow the lollowiug:
That I wrote, worked and voted agMinst Bryan ;
that I took part in the Palmer and Buckner
movement in California and was one of the
committee of three to prepare a petition to
have the Palmer and Buckner electors placed
on the official ballot; that I procured person
ally over 300 signatures; thai I was on the
committee on distribution of literature advo
cating the single gold standard; that
I was nominated for Presidential elector
on the Palmer and Buckner ticket and ac
cepted tbe same, though I afterward resigned
in lavor of Jeremiah Lynch E>q., to show my
respect for the virtues for which he is well
known. I repudiate the Cnicago platform
and indorse the platform of the National
Democratic party at Indianapolis.
Mr. Ball diew up charges to have Mr.
Heenan expelled.
Abraham Jacobs denied with some heat
that he was any relative of Isidur Jacob*,
as stated in a morning paper. He then
moved to remove President Cleveland's
picture from the room, but his motion was
voted down.
Then the council fires were put out and
the braves struck out on the trail across
the prairie.
RESTAURANT LIFE IN PARIS.
,
Americans Are the Mont Frequent Vic
tims of Servants.
The restaurant life of Paris, says a let
ter from that city in tne Louisville
Courier-Journal, is as distinctive and
idiosyncratic as the club life of London.
The two modes of living are totally differ
ent, however, and mark elementary di
vergencies of national character and tem
perament. The Frenchman is a gourmet;
the Englishman is a gourmand. The
Frenchman likes the open air; the Eng
lishman likes the open air. too, but lie
wants his open air to be lat'iced in and
girt about against intrusion. That which
delights the Frenchman â the flitter, the
chatter, tbe radiant and noisy ebb and flow
of the boulevardsâ offends the Euglish
man.
let the better restaurants of Paris do
not get their profits off their French pa
trons. It is the American who is relied on
to bring up tbe average and to convert a
loss into a gain, and for the Americans,
therefore, the trap is set and tbe triggers
are adjusted. He may swear and squirm
and arau-e the onlookers by his futile at
tempts in very crookea Frencli to make
his meaning plain, bat to no avail. He
will have to pay the bill. The swell restau
rants have discovered a device for taking
the luckless American completely captive
which deserves the name of great.
Like everything great it is simple. No
price is affixed to the several dishes upon
the bill of fare. Thus the stranerer is left
entirely in the dark. He is at the mercy
of tbe lady accountant and the head waiter.
There is no fix.d standard of value. There
is no check upon enterprising rapacity.
You order your dinner blindfold, and
when "la note" is brought you have no re
course.
The garcon shrugs his shoulders. The
other garcons stand around and grin.
Tbe maitre de cuisine is dignity a little
tempered by majesty. You know that you
are being swindled. You know that mon
sieur yonder, who has had more dishes
than you, and better served, has been
charged some 50 per cent lees. But what
can you do? You can do nothing. You
can simply disgorge. If yon ask the price
in advance you commit adreadful solecism.
What does milor care about price 3 ? Prices
are made for the canaille. If milor wants
cheap dinner he go to Duval. The Cafe
Voison exists for gentlemen, not for per
sons who need to economize. The Cafe
An_-laise does not desire cheap custom.
It prides itself on being "tres cher." The
poor American does not see it at all, but
yet his vanity being touched as well as vis
pocket, he goes away with an abridgment
of the basso in bis grumble. He is a
wiser but a poorer man.
WHAT SNAKES EAT.
Interesting Results From Sclenttfic
Observation.
During the last few months some of the
gentlemen connected with the Museum of
Natural History at Paris have given to
the world various interesting results of
their observations, says an exchange.
The learned professor at the museum,
Leon Vaiilant, describes the diet of * ser
pent more than twenty feet long, which
has been on exhibition at the Jardin dcs
Plantes since the month of August, 1825.
Uu to the end of 1895 this reptile had
eaten fifty times, :hat is, on an average of
five times a year. The largest number of
times in one year that the snake took food
was in 1886, when he ate seven times.
Nearly all the food consisted of the flesh
of goats, old and young. Three times,
however, the repast was composed iÂ»f rab
bits and once of a goose. The feeding of
the serpent, which will eat not bine but
what is alive, offers an uncommon specta
cle, and many persons request to have no
tice of the times when the creature feeds,
so as to witness the feeding. Yet the
lightning-like rapidity with which the
reptile seizes its prey produces a powerful
impression.
Apropos of the volume which can, by
means of distension, enter the stomachs
of serpents. Professor Valliant relates that
a French viper was once put in the same
caire with a horned vipe\. As these indi
viduals, although belonging to different
species, were of the same size, it was sup
posed that these reptiles would live amica
bly side by side.
Nevertheless the horned viper during
the following night swallowed his com
panion in captivity, and, in order to ac
commodate this prey so disproportionate
to itself, its body was distended to tÂ»uch a
degree that tne scales, instead of touching
each other laterally, and even overlaping
each other a little, as in its normal condi
tion, were separated, leaving between the
longitudinal rowa of them a space equal
to their own breadlb. All the same diges
tion proceeded regulav'.y and th*> viper did
not appear to have cjiffered in the least.
The case of the cobva hat swallowed an
other cobra by mistake *t the zoo affords
another example of this extraordinary ca
pacity for the accommodation of food.
Italy propose* to take the sale of quinine
out of the hands of the druggists and to
make it a Government monopoly. Drug
gists sell it at the rate of from Â£10 to
Â£20 a pound, while the Government gets
it for the army at Â£1 a pound.
The letter "I" in the Chinese language
has 145 ways of being pronounced, and
each pronunciation has a different
meaning.

An attempt of the monopoly to pass a
funding bill at the coming session of Con

and therefore the people must be vigilant,
and resolved to strike it a blow that will
kill it foiever.
The Coiusa Sun makes the good sugges

they should unite and begin the industry

The near approach of the meeting of
Conuress revives interest in the funding
bill and the people of California muot pre

A number of the leading papers of the

The Redding Free Press declares that

Football is a paying game in New York,

The Venezuelan question seems fairly

The report of ex-Congressman Louttit
in regard to the revival of manufacturing
industries in Colorado shows that even in
that State the defeat of free silver will not
be altogether a loss. Lik*Â» every other
section of the Union Colorado will profit
by the restoration of protection and in the
nest campaign she will return to the Ke
publican column, where she belongs.
THE FUNDING BILL.
The near approach of the date for the
assembling of Congress revives public in
terest in the funding bill. The passage of
such a bill this winter is not probable, but
it is possible. It behooves the people of
California, therefore, to be on their guard.
The monopoly is always at work*. It is in
a position to strike a decisive blow at any
moment, Tue people must be equally
vigilant ana prepared to guard against the
attack in whatever form it comes.
The fipht against this scheme of the
railroad company to fasten its monopoly
upon the people of California for at least
fifty years to come has up to this time
been ably conducted and has accomplished
a fair degree of success. While a con.
plete Tictory has not yet been won, the
efforts of the monopoly lobby have been
always thwarted, and 'the rights of tiie
people have been virtually maintained.
It would be a most grievous thing if at
this late day any lack of vigilance or
watchfulness should permit all past work
to bo rendered useless and the monopoly
to attain success after all.
It is hardly necessary to call for farther
mass-meetings on tiie subject, since the
sentiments of California have been already
so clearly expressed that there is no reason
to manifest them in that v.ay again. All
that is needed now is that the press of the
State should begin a new crnsade against
the funding bill and ronse public attention
once more to the issue. Every man who
has reason to believe he has influence with
any member of Congress should write to
that member and urge him to stand firm
on the side of justice and the people
against the spoliation schemes of the
monopoly.
If such tactics are pursued the attempt
to pass the bill at this session of Congress
will be baffled as such efforts have been in
the past, and the people of California will
have the satisfaction of winning a victory
which will not only emancipate them
selves from the cinch of a monopoly, but
will be in the truest sense of the word a
victory for American law over a gigantic
conspiracy to defeat it in the interests of
one of the most grasping and u reedy cor
porations known to the History of the
world.
Cougre?s will assemble in a few day 3.
If the funding bill is to be broneht up at
all at this session it will be presented al
most as soon as Consress meets. This,
therefore, is the time for the press and the
people to speak out. Every member of
Congress should be given notice that
public opinion on this subject has not
changed since last winter and that popu
lar sentiment remains as it was at that
time. We count on the delegation from
California to act as a nnit in the contest.
The moment for decisive battle seems to
have arrived. Now, then, let the iriends
of the people strike home and deal the
blow which wiil put an end to the iniquity
forever.
NO COMPROMISE BILL.
The report of our special correspondent
from Washington published yesterday
shows the prospects are that no attempt
will be made to pass the so-cailcd Dingley
bill even in an amended form at the
present session of Congress. This means,
of course, that an extra session will be
called as soon as President-elect McKin
ley takes his seat, and a comprehensive
protective measure will be enacted as
speedily as possible.
This report will be regarded as good
news throughout the country. It was, of
course, not wholly unexpected. The drift
of discussion in the press ever since the
election has shown an increasing popular
sentiment opposed to any compromise on
the tariff question. Tho demand i<? for a
comprehensive system of protection, and
the people would not be satisfied with a
tariff providing merely for revenue with
out regard to the industries of she country.
According to our correspondent, the
Senate is no longer the sore obstacle in
the way of the passage of an amended
compromise bill. The House itself, which
passed the Dingley bill at its last session,
would reject it now because of the chanced
conditions since the election. Moreover,
it seems to be assured that Cleveland
would not sicn such a bill, as he desires to
go out of office with the record of con
sistency on the tariff. This being so, the
bill is out of the question. We can now
look forward, therefore, to an extra ses
sion of Congress and a spaedy return to
that conservative protection wnich con
serves every industry of the country.
There can be little doubt that this solu
tion of the issue will be satisfactory to
the great majority of the American
people. A compromise measure that
would have been expedient last winter,
when it would have had at least eighteen
months to run, was quite s different
thing from a compromise measure tnat
cannot be expected to live more than six
months. Last winter a Bpeedy return to
protection was doubtful; this winter it is
certain. Therefore the reasons which im
pelled the Republican majority in the
House of Representatives last winter are
no longer valid, and what was good
statesmanship then would be folly now.
It 18 believed that as soon as President
elect McKinley takes his seat he will call
an extra session of Congress to assemble
at once, and there is good reason for the
hope that a Republican tariff can ba en
acted before the end of July. This policy
will give a new stimulus to industry and
will do much to augment the revival of
trade so happily begun. The policy,
therefore, deserves general commenda
tion, aDd we have no doubt will receive it
from all except those Bourbon free
traders wbom no experience can tench
and who care more for their particular
theory than they do for the welfare of the
country.
A SECRETAR Y OF MINES.
In a recent interview President Neff of
the California Miners' Association is
quoted as saying: "We expect the com
mittee on agitation for a Secretary of
Mines and Mining to commence work
richt away. Our Congressional delegation
is heartily in favor of the proposition and
we want it to assist us in interesting tho
Representatives from States like Pennsyl
vania and New York."
This committee should in its work re
ceive the hearty co-operation of tbe press
throughout all jhe mining States. As
will be seen by a letter from Senator
Mitchell, published this morning, it will
have strong support in Congress. We
hayÂ« been glad to see that many papers
in this section have already begun tbe
work of a campaign of education on the
subject, and we trust it will not be long
before every newspaper published in a
mining State wiil take up the causa and
promote it by all means in its power.
The contest is not one in which miners
only are interested. It concerns the gen
eral welfare of the wnole conntry. The
prosperity of the United States depends
in no small measure upon the develop
ment of mines, and that can be best
brought about by giving to that industry
all tbe benefits which accrue from Govern
ment supervision and Government aid
where such aid is necessary.
At the present time our mining laws &re
iof such a perplexing character it is diffi
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 28, 1890.
cult for any one to understand them. As
tiae been pointed out, it is not always easy
to set a ruling on doubtful questions of
these law*, even when an appeal is taken
direct to the Govcrnniont. The head of
tho Bureau of Public Lands does not al
ways give the same ruling as the Secre
tary of the Interior, and a dispute as to
whether certain lands are agricultural or
mineral not infrequently leads to confu
sion ana involves a serious lose to the
prospective miner.
The magnitude of the industry is in
itself sufficient to justify the appointment
of an officer tc represent it in tho Cabinet
of the Nation. A further argument for
the appointment of such an official is
found In the extremely scientific character
of the industry, and the fact that Ameri
can miners are brought into competition
witn those of other countries, whose work
is aided by all the powers of their govern
ments. Since the great nations of Europe
have Ministers to attend to mining af
fairs and to promote them, it is certainly
necessary for the United States to give an
equal attention to the mining industry of
this country.
We bespeak, therefore, for the commit
tee appointed by President Neff to agi
tate this question the cordial support of
the press in every section of the Union.
Certainly the newspapers of the West
ought to engage in it with ardor and
energy. We have entered into this tight,
ana ought to prosecute' it with the inten
tion of winning. Whatever plan the
miners adopt shonid be cordially seconded
by Congressmen from tne mining States
and by the press. The work has been well
oegun. Let it be pushed forward wiyi
vim and vigor and the end wiil be victory.
" THE SUNDAY CALL."
In to-morrow's issue of The Call will
apnear a multitude of features which will
commend themselves to the discriminat
ing readers of San Francisco, and in fact
to the whole wide West. The matter in
The Sunday Call is always timely, always
interesting, and more than this, it is al
ways clean as well as clever.
As the fall exhibition of the Art
Association comes nearer, the won
der naturally grows among all who
are familiar with San Francisco art
work as to what new ideas will be
brought out. The Call is enabled to fur
nish an answer that will be quite compre
hensive in its nature, for it will to-morrow
reproduce pen-sketches of their own best
new p!ece3 by such well-known and dis
tinguished knights of brush ana palette
as Will Keith, Tom Hill, John St^ntou,
A. Jouillin ana L. P. Latim*r. These
sketcnes will afford excellent ideas of the
effect that is conveyed by the original
paintings.
A poem on the glories of the Golden
Gate, superbly illustrated, will be found
to contain some very appreciable merits.
"An Idyl of Autumn in Northern Cali
fornia," by Olive Heyden, makes beauti
ful reading for those who have a taste for
the poetic in nature. In the northern
part of the Golden State is found an
autumn that reminds one of the East, in
a measure. The leaves turn color, the
snow is seen afar oft, the early morning
sparfcles with dry cold, but, unlike the
East, all this is in the midst of roses and
under a cloudless sky. Miss Heyden de
scribes most happily this season of
dreamy lights, bright tints and smoky
distances.
Penelope Powelson has an article full of
useful hints and suggestions with refer
ence to children who are compelled to
wear spectacles. It is a pood, common
sense talk, and parents will find much
food for thought in it.
The "Oddest Cemetery in the World"
relates to a private horse burial ground,
wherein monuments are erected to the
memory of favorite steeds.
A new and exceedingly novel practical
use for bicycles furnishes the subject for
an up-to-date sketch.
Particular mention must be accorded a
splendid picture of Sac Francisco, as
viewed from the bay, by W. A. Coulter.
It will bd one of the strong illustrative
features of the Sunday edition.
Tho horse show also receives the atten
tion it demands at tiie hands of the
artists and writers. It is hardly necessary
to enumerate lurther, but let it be re
markea that the children's department is
rich in contents and pictures; the fashion
page gives the latest notes on the winter
styles; society has a complete record of
its comings and goings, its hops and en
tertainments for the week past; the lovers
of whist have a resume of the latest
theories of the came, prepared by an ex
pert; the editorials are vigorous and able,
the book reviews faithful and conscien
tious, the telegraphic service the best,
and the news contents unequaled on tue
slope. Orders for The Sunday Call
should be sent in early.
THE BEET-SUGAR INDUSTRY
Dcs Moit.es Capital.
The convention of farmers and other Ne
braska people held recently In Grand Island
resulted in a series of resolutions of the fol
lowing import: That the relief of farmers
from the overplus of corn and wheat and low
prices of the same calls for a diversity of
products. The beet-sugar industry having
proven profitable and promising it should be
fostered. In view of the fact that American
consumers are paying the sum ot $120,000,000
yearly to foreign nations for sugar which
might be produced here by lessening the
acreage of coru and wheat, and that several
countries abroad are paying liberal bounties
for the protection of their beet guitar industry,
the re-enactment of the present law giving a
bounty to beet-producers is urgently re
quested.

ON SUPPRESSING BRYAN.

MM,
_Â^Â° l * Editor, af the San Francisco Call-Sir.:
This being Thanksgiving day it seemed meet
lormeasono who voted : for Bryan and : the
whole reform movement he represented, in
cluding not only the restoration of silver to
free coinage, but also the greater issue of
paper money by the Government only, to read
the Examiner's editorial on "Thanksgiving"
and see what it might suggest to the defeated
porters of Bryan as causes for i gratitude and
thanksgiving, assuming, Â«s of course I should,
that the Examiner singly desired the sue
,,l, V J h ?K 5n5 n movement." . : Well, I have
lust read â  the editorial entitled "Thanksgiv

<otJ \ ill t. ar ?i y ** expected that we shall
join with President Cleveland and some of the
devout Governors of -Eastern States in enum
erating the result of th* election among our
causes for gratitude," and I' agreed witn the
Examiner and read on: -Bat there are some
leiitures ii en of that momentous event in
Mnicn all Americans may justly feel joy and
prlae." The first "feature" of the "event"
mentioned, however, was the alleged "general
expectation abroad" . that serious trouble
would follow the election, as "it was thought
that the beateu side might refuse to submit";
but -they have learned," says the Examiner,
that while. wo may be hot partisans before an
election, we are all loyal Americans after-
Ward, etc - : Of course I felt duly grateful that
these foreigners had changed their opinion of
us, and reed on for other "features."
la the next paragraph we are told that "we
should of! grateful for the gift of. continued
P e . UCe > - reference being made to our relations
with Jingland concerning the Venezuelan con
tention, which indicates Â«-.n abrupt chance of
subject since no one would consider that a
feature" of the election. But the next para
graph certainly takes us back to a "feature
of that momentous event In which all Ameri
cans may justly feel joy and pride," and in
lairness to the Examiner I will give the whole
of this remarkable paragraph, because it ap
peared in a journal which claimed that It loy
ally supported Bryan and sincerely desired
his success. It runs thus: ..JilltlHlJMUlPli 1 * 1
"And we have especial cause to be thankful
for the promised return of prosperity. We have
suffered from a long and cruel siege of hard
times, but the end of it seems to be in sight.
Our farmers are getting better prices for their
productsâ a thing which is not a matter of
thanksgiving to the famine-stricken peasants
ol India, wtiose sufferings our own good for
tune must not make us forget. Our factories
arc beginning to reopen and our idle work
men are finding employment. The morbid
state ot mind that has been solely responsible
for our troubles is parsing away. The people
who have worried themselves into financial
sickness have determined to be well and the
determination makes them well. For this
mind cure let us give thanks."
That is the paragraph in full, and if it had
appeared in Bradstreet's, which may be
regarded as "the business-mnu's Bible, Issued
in weekly parts," or in the New York Journal
of Commerce or the Evening Post it would
have occasioned little , surprise, though it
would have been rather "raw" for. even, such
goldbug journals; but what can be said in ex
cuse for the editorial use of .such language by
the Examiner twentr-iwo days after the elec
tion? I make special reference to these two
sentences, though, the whole paragraph chal
lenges the self-respect of every man who | sup
ported and voted for Bryan: "The morbid
state of mind that has been solely responsible
for our troubles is passing away," and "The
people who have wonied themselves into finan
cial sickness have determined to be well, and
the determination makes them well."
It will be news of unspeakable importance
to nearly one-half the people of our country,
and to large majorities of them in some Slates,
that it was a "morbid state of mind" w-hich
'â¢is solely responsible for our troubles," and
that free ' coinage of silver and money strin
gency and trusts and monopolies have no part
in it, ami they cannot fail to render, "thanks
giving"' that it is passing away. Let us chari
tably hope that the Examiner at once tele
graphed this news to Mr. Bryan, and that it
will In some clear way soon show him that he
is only in a morbid state of mind and has wor
ried himself into financial sickness and can at
once get well by willing himself well, for the
poor man Is going right ahead with the work
ot the campaign as a preparation for 1900. and
is in fact creating so strong a sentiment in fa
vor of perpetuating this morbid state of mind
that such a staid and conservative journal as
the Bulletin of this City is quite upset and has
been thrown into a state of hysteria over Bry
an's success as an advocate of "treason" and
"revolution," all of which appears in an edito
rial of yesterday bearing the alarming title of
â¢'A Dangerous Man," the half column of de
nunciation, warning and entreaty closing with
these stirring words: "The real need in this
Nation would seem to be a campaign for the
suppression of William â¢â  Jennings Bryan â
short, sharp and decisive." .â¢-.â â  â 
Of course there are two ways of putting down
Bryan. One is the Examiner method ot assur
ing the people that prosperity has ' returned,
lor our troubles all come from a morbid state
of mind which is happily passing away, and
hence such men as Bryan have only worried
themselves into financial sickness and will
soon have an access of determination to get
well and then will be well. The other wav of
suppressing Bryan Is the short, sharp and de
cisive one proposed by the Bulletin. But if it
should appear that nearly half of the Nation
still holds with Bryan to the doctrine - advo
cated by the Examiner thirty days since a
campaign against free speech in the person of
Bryan, as proposed by the Bulletin, may prove
to be a worse form of revolution than any ut
terance of Bryan, and the Bulletin and all for
whom it speaks may find when too late that
its own method of suppression can be applied
to Itself as well as to Bryan. .

SUMMING UP THE RESULTS.
Benefits arising i^eom tite Triumph of j
Sound Money.
*Louisvi!le Courier-Journal.
The benefits already gained since the defeat
of free silver and free riots are enormous. The
restoration of confidence is complete, and tins
has already produced tha following tangible
results:
Firstâ The release ol vast sums which had
been hoarded by tne timid and the appearance
of gold in current circulation. The aggregate
amount of money withdrawn from employ
ment can ouly be guessed at, but it was cer- j
tainly not less than $300,000,000 or $400,- !
000,000. Good judges my the total of the KOld j
hoards alone was not less than $100,000,000.
Tne return to daily use of the precious metal
is the most striking indication of the banish
ment of alarm.
Secondâ A phenomenal ease In the money
market. This is true of every section, but, of
course, is chiefly noticeable in the great finan
cial centers, such as New York, Boston and
Chicago. In New York money is now freely
loaned at '1). A ana 3 per cent on call, being
relatively much cheaper than in London. Dj
posiis are increasing at an astonishing rate,
and it is likely thai the cost of loan* will fall
still lower. The enormous advantage Of cheap
money goes hand in hand with security. The
day before the election money was loaned in
Wall street at 9? percent oh call, and it was a
matter oi sheer impossibility :o secure "time"
loans. The longer money cau be placed now
the better it suits the lender.
Thirdâ A compilation of dispatches pub
lished since the day of election up to yester
day shows that 372 indusirinl establishments
have started up and '.JGB have increased their
force*, while arrangements have beeu made
to spend millions of dollars in new enter
prises. Some of the plants tnat have resumed
operations employ thousands of laborers. The
Cambria Iron Works, for instance, requires a
force of 7000. It hns rjever had a strike and
had never been shut down until forced to
close some weeks ago by the currency agita- I
tlon.
Fourthâ An Advance in wheat, corn, oats,
tobacco, barley, rye, flaxseed, potatoes and
hides, which have added hundreds of millions
to the aggregate wealth of farmers. The pig
iron market has also advanced, and it is no
no trouble now to sell imything of value. A
ready market awaits practically everything.
The few who are complaining tuat they
have not yet experienced any of the benefits
that were promised for a vindication of our
National nonor are invited to ponder these
undoubted facts. White none is so blind as
those who will not see, it is impossible to un
derstand how any sane man can shut his
eyes to the wonderful change that has come
over the country within the past fortnight.
Only those who believed there would be a
Government distribution of silver in the event
oJ Bryan's election can now complain that

TRAVELED FROM
FAMOUS CARLSBAD
Editor Julius Seligmann on
the Rush to the Ancient
Springs.
The Number of Californians Who
Go There Constantly
Increasing.
A Stamping-Ground for Dukes, Earls,
Kings and Other Pecp'e of
High Degree.
Julius Seligmann, editor and proprietor
of the Carlsbad Herald and Carlsbad
Zeitung, at the famous springs in Bohe-
mia, arrived here ypsterday and is at the
Palace. He is in California for pleasure
and will spend some time here, visiting
Yosemite and other places.
The Carlsbad Herald is printed in Eng
lish for the benefit of th-e throng of English
and American visitors. It is unique in
that way, being the only one of the kind
in all Bohemia. It is devoted almost en
tirely to society news.
"Every year between 4000 and 5000 Amer
icans visit Carlsbad," said Mr. Seligmann.
"The season lasts from May 1 to October
1, and during that time between 40,000
and 50,000 people, as a whole, come there.
Of course there are some there all the
time, even in the coldest winter weather.
Among the visitors are the famous people
of earth, including Kings, Queens, Em
perors, Princes, Presidents and men emi
nent in all the professions and callings of
every kind.
"The town from which the seventeen
springs, take their name now has about
12,000 people, but with the suburbs there
are, I should say, fully 20,000. It iÂ» an ex
quisitely beautiful place. The houses are
all three stories high, fireproof and hand
some. New and magnificent bathhouses
have lately been built. The heat of the
â¢rater of the springs ranges up as high as
IG3 degrees*. The water of the Sprudel
spring, which is the hottest, spurts out of
a geyser thirty feet high, like the geysers
of the Yellowstone.
"All the visitors there are known as
cure guests. No, they are not called 'one
lungers,' as in some parts of the globe.
About 5,000,000 bottles of the mineral
water are sent out to different parts of the
country each year. Finer hotels are being
added constantly to the town as is re
quired till now tne hotels are on the scale
of the Palace, and constitute among the
finest in the world.
"Recently more Californians than usual
I have been visiting Carlsbad. 1 have made
tde acquaintance of a great many of them
there. All Bohemia is very prosperous.
I think it is in better condition financially
than the United States, and I might say
the same of Austria as a whole. Francis
Joseph I, who rules over all Austria and
Hungary, is much loved, and his dynasty
has been attended by much prosperity."

VIOLA HASTINGS"
LOSES A POINT
Ordered to Produce the
Alleged Hastings
Love- Letters.
WAS SHE CALLED WIFE?
Says She Had a Cartload of Such
Letters, but Would Not
Show Them.
JUDGE COFFEY SAYS SHE MUST
An Importent Move in the Cas3
Won ty the Counsel for Mrs.
Diri ing's Children.
When S. Clinton Hastings died the gen
eral public did not expect that a hitherto
unsuspected widow would loom upon the
horizon with a right band and open palm
extended for hi 1 * estate.
The contention now pending before the
Probate Court is all the more interesting
because of the prominence of the de
ceased. Judge Hastings was formerly a
Justice of the Supreme Court of the State
of lowa. He was the fir.-t Chief Justice
of the Supreme Court of the State of
California and afterward its Attorney-
General, while he was universally recog
nized by his fellow-members of the bar as
a jurist of unsurpassed learning and legal
qualifications. An the iounder of the
Hastings Law College his name is a
household word in the ranks of the legal
fraternity.
The woman who claims title to some of
the dead man's effects sat in Judge Cof
fey's court yesterday afternoon while
Samuel M. Shortridge and Matt Sullivan,
counsel on both sides, argued on a motion
growing out of an incident during the
woman's examination before Notary Pub
lic Levy a short time ago. In tbe course
of that examination she swore that she
had a wagon-load of letters from the de
ceased, in which he addressed her as his
"Pettie," his '-Darling" and his "Dear
Wife."
Mr. Sliortridge, who was conducting the
examination on behalf of the Hastings
neirs. requested her to produce those let
ters, ii any such existed, and she declined
to do so. Mr. Sliortridge appeared before
Judge Coffey, and asked mat the court
make an order compelling her to produce
the letters lor his inspection.
Mr. Shortridce stated to the court that
Mrs. Mary Viola Hastings:, as she called
herself, alleged that she was the surviving
widow of the deceased, and that he was
not of sound mind at the time he execnted I
his will and the several codicils attached J
thereto. He then recited the fact or the i
deposition ana the statement of the woman \
regarding her possession of certain letters
alleged to have been written to her by the
deceased, which letters she alleged con
tained expressions calculated to stiow that
he regarded her as his wife. He argued j
that the letters were material to the case,
and that therefore the witness should bÂ«
compelled to produce the letters.
Attorney Sullivan on behalf of the
claimant read a section of the code, and
argued tbat the woman could not be com
pelled to produce the letters beiore the
notary. He intimated that Mr. Short
ridSJe was "fishing."
"Ye?, fishing for the truth," replied Mr.
Shortridge.
In support of his motion, Mr. Shortridse
argued tuat he was acting under the regu
lar rules of procedure. The law was not to
be construed as preventing a party from
compelling another to produce boons or
papers when he is under examination us a
witness before a notary. If she had
been examined before the court there is
ne doubt that she would have been or
dered to produce the documents, they be
ing material. "The contestant claims to
do the widow of Judge Hastings. She
must at the very outset establish this
claim. She undertakes to do so by saying
that Judge Hastings recognized her as his
wife and addressed her many letters as
such. These letters, if they exist, are ol
vital importance in this case. It is idle to
question their materiality. The con
testant says they are in her possession. If
bo, we ask that they be produced," said
tbe attorney.
Judge Coffey granted Mr. Shortridge's
motion and said that he would glen the
necessary order at 2 o'clock this after
noon.
The taking of the deposition of the al
leged widow of Judge Hastings will be re
sumed before Notary Levy.

BABY TOLAND
WILL CONTEST
He Wants to Know Why
His Grandmother For
got Her Darling.
Aged Mrs. Toland Named the
Child "William the Grand,"
Then Cut It Off.
Neglect of That Which She Loved
Best on Earth a Sign of
Mental Incapacity.
An interesting contest i? pending in the
Superior Court in the matter of the estate
of Mrs. Mary B. Toh'.nd, who was the
I widow of Dr. H. H. Toland, celebrated in
I local history as founder of the Toland
j Medical College.
Reduced to its simplest analysis the
i legal battle now being waged is one
! wherein little William Gridley Toland,
j aged 7, seeks through bis attorney, Samuel
i M. Shortriuge, to have that part of his
grandmother's large estate fall to him
which, it is claimed, Mrs. Toland intended
WILLIAM GRIDLEY TOLAND, Infant Contestant of the Will of
His Grandmother, the Late Mrs. Mary B. Toland, "Who
Cailed Him " William the Grand."
to bestow upon the little piece ol humanity
whose veins contain her blood.
The infant contestant came into her life
in tbe mellow days of siivery age, a rare
and wonderful babe, handsome as a Greek,
eloquent as Demosthenes "in his inno
cent tears and liquid of childhood.
It was she who Â£rst held him in her happy
arms and taught him to lisp words of
love â and thus sweet babyhoou wooed and
won old age. It was by such means tbat
she came to name that whi<-h she loved
best in all the world, "Wiliium, the
Grand."
U has always been a mystery to those
who knew of the wealthy grandmother's
warm love for her grandchild that she
made a will wherein fie boy was cut off
with a pittance of $2000.
Tne cold logic of the law, the natural
equity recorded in musty tomes would
have given "William, the Grand," half of
his grandmother's estate, the other half
to her son Hugo, whose deposition ia now
being taken in the contest, and who
appears as a gladiator doing battle with
his baby nephew.
But the will contains many strange pro
visions that show how cruelly the frosts
of old age warped the nature of tbe testa
trix, causing her to bestow half of her
wealth upon strangers and livers others,
practically forgetting tbe child.
Tho following is the unique and
strangely punctuated reference made to
the child she so dearly loved:
To William Gridley Tolandâ The Son of doctor
Charles Oridlejr Tolandâ who took my hus
bands name after my marriage (now dead) He
being my son by a former marriage â Two
Tnousand dollarsâ As I had given to Dr.
Charles ail his father's properlyâ including
my share.
Tbe contestant's attorneys take the po
sition that it was a strange phase of men
tal capacity that undertook to provide for
a favorite grandchild out of funds spent
by its father before its birth. But it is
said that Dr. Charles Toland never got the
amount mentioned in the will.
These proceedings came to light yester
day during the taking of depositions in
tbe contest. The depositions were taken
in tho oliices of Deinias & Shortridge,
George H. Mastick representing Hu^o
Toland while John B. Mboon appeared for
various other legatees and Wilson & Wil
son for Grace Church.
It came to light that the aged lady
mused much in her last days over tbe
possibility of attnining literary immor
tality by reason of some verses she com
posed and paid various Eastern book pub
lishers to print. In her will the unique
statement appears that she added the
initial "M" to her name "because oi my
rithmic works." She bequeathed to the
Hopkins Art Institute the income of her
literary productions, also the illustrations
that appeared in various editions to make
plainer the meaning ot her muse.
The dramatis personÂ© in the legal play
now on are chiefly Hugo Toland and his
little nephew, '"William, the Grand." The
estate for which they are hauling consists
of 3329 acres of valuable land in Solano
County known as Tolands Landing.
By the conditions of the will this land is
sought to be disposed of by a trust, de
scribed and created in such a way as to
raise a grave question as to Its legality. In
addition to the formal contest of the will
a suit has been brought in Solano County
to set aside the trust as illegal and void
and agamst the statutes authorizing the
creation of trusts in land.
The success of either of the suits directed
acainst the will would make the grand
child neir to half of its grandmother's
estate. Tnose who knew Mrs. Toland
bost believe that the victory of the con
testant would really result in the distri
bution of her estate as she intended it
should be distributed before she reached
that feeble state ot mind that caused her
to forget moral duty and abandon her
long-expre>scd intentions.
It was shown by many letters of the
deceased grandmother that she was very
fond of .Mrs. Charles loland, mother of
the contestant. Letters were produced,
showing that she frequently addressed the
doctor's family as "my dear little chicks,"
and signed hersel!, "affectionately, Mami-
ta," and u?ed like terms of endearment
on many occasions.
It was .ilso shown that the grand
mother's health was very bad for several
year? just before she died. She traveled
practically around the world, being treated
for bronchitis in India, Algeria, France
and elsewhere.
The little grandson's attorney has agreed
that if the will is broken the bequest
of $500 to Grace Church phall be given
from the child's part. The outcome of the
case will be looked for with great interest.
Tne biographical features of the Toland
family that benr on this case are not unin
teresting. The testatrix whose will is
being attacked on the ground of her men
tal incapacity bad a son, Charles Gridley
Tolond, by a former husband. He dieu
before his mother, and his mother died on
November 25, 1895. The only heirs thus
left were Hugo Toland, whose deposition
called out the foregoing facts, and ths lit
tie grandson, Wiiiiam Gridley Toland,
whoss father was Dr. Charles, "and whose
mother wns formerly Trella Foltz, daugh
ter of Mr?. Clara Foltz, the well-known
lawyer and lecturer.
Judge Slack long ago appointed Samnel
M. Shortridge guardian and attorney for
the infant contestant. In the discharge
of his duties ns guardian and attorney
Mr. Shortridge caused t::e facts stated in
this narrative to be brought to light.

A FATHER'S DUTY
TO HIS CHILDREN
Judga Coffey Asked to Set
tle a Disputed
Point.
Should Their Support Be De
rived From Their Dead
Mother's Estate?
R. C. Goodspeed's Application for a
F.imi y Allowance for Minor
Hdrs Is Opposed.
In Judge Coffey's court yesterday morn
ing a very interesting question was brought
up when the application for family allow
ance was made on behalf of the Goodspeed
children. The point at issue was whether
a father who is able to support his chil
dren ought to draw on their inheritance
for the purpose of paying their current
living expenses and for their education.
Samuel M. Shortridge and Charles F.
Hanlon, representing the special ad
ministrators of the estate of Lucy
C. Gocdspeeu, deceased, objected to
an allowance of $250 a month asked for
in the petition of K. C. Goodspeed, to pay
the expenses of his two minor children, of
whose persons and property he has been
appointed guardian. There was an inti
mation that the excess of family allow
ance, if put in possession of Mr. Good
speed, would be used for the purpose of
assisting the contestants of the will of
Mrs. Goodspeed, to the detriment of the
younger children, his wards, who are the
principal beneficiaries under the will.
The petition of Mr. Goodspeed sets forth
that Mrs. Lucy C. Goodspeed died in this
City on the 7th of last March, leaving an
estate exceeding in value $100,000; that be
has been appointed guaruian oi Eiland
Caarles Goodspeed, aged 14, and Florence
Norine Goodspeed, aged 12, children of tbe
deceased, and mat ne requested the grant
ing of a tamily allowance of $250 a month
for the proper maintenance of the chil
dren.
Mr. Goodspeed testified that he is the
father of Ryland and Florence. He was
formerly the husband of Lucy Goodspeed,
but she obtained a divorce. He enumer
ated a considerable amount of personal
and real property which he owns, and J
admitted that he now had some ,
$3000 cash on hand. He receives j
a regular salary of ?125 a month [
from the O. C. Pratt esiate as farmer. On |
his own account last year he made $2.'i00 >
and paid out $900 or $1000 for taxes and j
other expenses. Tbe minors named are j
now the only members of his family. He :
contributes some for the support of his I
married children, but that is voluntary.
Aiter the divorce from his wife he paid
$125 a month for the support of the chil- |
dren until his wile's death, which occurred
last March. Since that event he has paid
$60 a month to Mrs. Stanford, a sister of
the minors, for their support.
Mr. Goodspeed admitted that he had
borrowed $0000 on a 50- vara lot iv this City,
of which he has still $3000.
"Did you contribute any part of that
$5000 to the contest in this estate?" was
ai-ked.
Mr. Heggerty objected to the form of
this question.
Judge Coffey said it might bo modified
so as to elicit from the witness whether he
had contributed any of the money so bor- I
rowed to the support of the children.
Mr. Shortridce said: "1 will ask you the {
direct question, Have you not been an
tagonistic to the Interests of your minor
children and wards by contributing funds
for the contest of the estate of Lucy Good
speed, deceased?"
Mr. Heggerty objected, and there was]

a spirited discussion lasting several min
utes."---". ".'".."" .* *.;â¢ ';â  -Â« J â  < â 
Then Attorney Garret McEnerney. rep
resenting the two children, took a "hand,
and omitting reference to the supposed
antagonism of Mr. Goodspeed to the in
terests of his minor children, who are
also his wards, asked:
"Have you appropriated that $2000, or
any part of it. for the purpose of carrying
on this contest?"
After considerable argument, in which
Messrs. heggerty, Hanlon, Shortridge
and McEnerney joined, the court allowed
the queslion. and Mr. Goodspeed answered
in the negative.
Mr. Goodspeed said he had always been
willing to support the children to the best
of his ability, and is willing to do so yet.
He will do all that the court requires of
him in that regard to the exteut of his
ability.
He said he is in good health and able to
provide some support for the children,
but not so much as he thinks they ought
to have.
Mr. Heggerty then attempted to elicit a
history of tho financial condition of Mr.
Goodspeed's elder children, and finally
asked what he thought the minors ought
to have for their support. He said they
ought to receive not less than $100 each a
month, of which sum he would be willing
to contribute one-half, or as much as the
court should think was proper.
It was explained that the attor
neys for the estate object to the
family allowance on the ground that Mr.
Goodspeed is able to support and educate
his own children and that it is his duty to
do so irrespective of their interest in the
mother's estate, said interest being con
tingent on the settlement of the estates of
N. E. Pratt and O. C. Pratt; that the
estate of Lucy Goodspeed has only a small
amount of money available lor payment
of a family allowance if ordered bj
the court, and that the property of the
estate does not produce revenue in exco^s
of the necessary expenses lor interest,
court fees, etc.
Mr. Hanlon. explained that it would be
very vexatious to have an order laid on
the administrator of the estate which he
could not obey, and then he would be
liable to be called up at any time to an
swer a charge of contempt on account of
non-payment.
Jurtge Coffey said that contempt pro
ceedings had been abolished in his de
partment, so far as laymen were con
cerned.
Daniel J. Sullivan, administrator of the
estate of Mrs Goodspeed, testified that
the estate now has $064 on hand, against
which there are claims amounting to $188.
The cash income is $65 a month for rent of
residence on California sireet. Interest on
the mortgage, payable monthly, is $54 a
month. In addition there are some court
fees and bills of printers for transcripts
and briefs.
Answering Mr. Heggerty Mr. Sullivan
said the estate owns 541 sacks of wheat in
3utte County, insured for $700. The wheat
is soon to be sold. Mr. Sullivan said he
had no objection to tbe granting of a
family allowance, except that the estate is
not able to pay it.
C. F. Hanlon testified that he is ac
quainted with the litigation in wnich the
Goodspeed estate is involved; that four
appeals are now pending, and that it is
n cessary to reserve all the available
funds of the estate in order to pay prsssing
bills. Mr. Hanlon said that he did not
tnink it would be for tho best interests of
the minors to have money paid to Mr.
Goodspeed, as it was understood that his
interests and sympathies are antasonistic
to theirs, so far as the contest of their
mother's will is concerned, and part of the
money might be used to their detriment
in that respect.
Mr. Shortridge then introduced the de
cree in the divorce proceedings brougiit by
the late Mrs. Goodspeed against her hus
band, in which decree the father was or
dered to support the minor children. This
decree is Mill in full force.
Argument of the case was continued
until next Friday.

THE SPORTING WORLD
What the Lovers of the Field, the Stream and the
Track Are Doing.
Now that the great football game and
boating contests of the year are features of
the past the patrons of sport will turn
their attention to other lines of amuse
ment. '
The wheelmen have several races in con
templation, which, doubtless, will be well
attended.
Sportsmen who have a fascination for
duck and quail shooting are enjoying
splendid sport, and the anglers who look
forward to many pleasant days in the
country will soon have an opportunity of
testing their rods and lines on the game
steelhead.
Fanciers of the greyhound are now in
the height of their glory, as this is the
season of the year when hares run best.
The greatest feature in the sporting line
at present is boxing. On Monday evening
the Golden West Club will give an enter
tainment, and on Wednesday evening the
National Club will hold its big show in
the Pavilion.
THE WHEELMEN.
Success of the New Velodrome.
Associated Clubs' Meeting.
The success of the two big meets at the
Velodrome last Saturday and Thanks
giving day has prompted the manage
ment to have the entire place roofed
over, and work has already begun with
that end in view. With the place com
pletely ' protected from the elemeuts it
Charles Goodwin, the Crack
â¢ Amateur of the San Francisco
Road Club.
will be a delightful recreation-ground,
and with the wina entirely shut off the
records will begin to drop on that track
so fast as to surprise people. It is a
speedy, safe, scientifically constructed
six-lap board track, is the one at the
Velodrome, and from both the riders' and
spectators' points of view is the best in
California. The San Jose three-lap
cement track is not to be compared with
it. With hardly yet time to become
thoroughly accustomed to it the amateurs
made a competition mile on it ti:e open
ing day in 2:07, and a paced mile in 1:57.
A lap *;as been made in :16 fiat, and a
paced half-mile in :56. This is record
time, and with proper pacing arrange
ments the track may soon become world
renowned for the records it will hoid.
It is the intention to hold fortnightly
meets from now on, and possibly nij;ht
racing later in the winter. The arrival of
some more of the Eastern flyers next
month and in January will give added in
terest to the sport, and altogether San
Francisco will probably enjoy as fine a
season of winter cycling-racing as any
city has ever had. There are plenty of
lovers of the sport here when it is good,
as has been evidenced by the immense
crowds at the two meets thus far given,
and they have gone away thoroughly sat
isfied with the racing as exhibited at the
new Velodrome. Every one was agreeably
surprised at the large crowd which at
tended Thanksgiving day, for it was feared
that the football game, as a counter-at
traction, would draw all the people. But
this was not so, for the Velodrome attend
ance was large and the enthusiasm high.
The meet to be held next Saturday will
probably be the best thus far given. Be
sides the usual scratch and handicap ama
teur and professional events there will be
tandem races, record trials and a match
. race between W. A. Terrillof the Bay City
\V heel men and W. E. Becker, the five-mile
National champion, for the Velodrome
shield which Terrill won a week ago, and
to bold which he has to ride every two
weeks, when challenged by a foeman
worthy of his "wheel."
Some excuse may be found for Allan
Jones' curious riding Thursday in the fact
that at the time Jones was of the impres
sion that Referee Welch intended to order
the nnal of the two-thirds of a mile scratch
professional run over, on account of the
slow time made, and he wanted to save
himself for it, knowing that /as a back
marker in the two-mile professional handi
cap he had little chance of winning a posi
tion or a prize. He applied to the referee
to be excused from tne race entirely, but
Mr. Welch could not see it that way, and
â¢rdered him to ride. Then Allan sulked,
loafed around the track for a few laps, got
in the way of the other riders, and finally
was ordered off the track. After a time,
when the referee announced that the two
thirds event should not be run over, Jones
probably wished he had not made such a
tame exhibition in the two-mile, particu
larly after the way the audience treated
him. It is safe to say that Jones won't do
it again, as he is a sensible young man
and must see that a repetition of im
Thursday's work would practically end
his racing days for all time. Here's hoping
he will do better the next time he starts.
The annual meeting of the associated
clubs will be held next Saturday evening
at the San Francisco Road Club, when
new delegates from the twenty-two clubs
belonging to the association will take their
seats aud a new set of officers will be
elected. The contest for the presidency
lies between A. P. Swain of the Acme
Club Wheelmen and A. W. Weihe of the
San Francisco Road Club. J. F. Hancock
of the Bay City Wheelmen will have no op
position to his re-election for the secretary
treasurership. The names of the follow
ing new delegates have already been sent
in to the secretary: Golden Gate Cycling
Clubâ Al Lewis, George Payton, W. J.
Black; California Cycling Clubâ R. s.
Duncan, W. O. Johnson, C. J. Vermeil;
Pathfinder Bicycle Clvb â Harry Goodman,
T. W. Flanigan, James Clunan ; Waverly
Cycling Clubâ B. W. Elston, P. Allen Joy
and Fred Siebe. The other eighteen clubs
must send in the names of their delegates
at once to secure their enrollment in time
for the election, or they will lose their
votes.
The road races scheduled for to-morrow
at Menlo Park have been postponed one
week. Tne entries will be reopened until
Wednesday next
The meet will consist of a quarter-mile
match race between A. B. Johnson of
Redwood City and Rod Taylor ot Menio
Park; a half-mile scratch, one-mile handi
cap and five-mile handicap.
The initial event is the match race be
tween Johnson and Taylor. Taylor was
thÂ° acknowledged champion of San Mateo
County in 1895 and 1896 till recently, when
Johnson suddenly came into prominence
and startled local riders by winning a hard
fought novice in San Jose on September 9.
Johnson seems to be the favorite.
The capital invested in cycle manufac
tures in the United States is estimated to
be over $125,000,000 and the number of peo
ple empioyeJ in their manufacture and the
sale of wheels as over 150,000, according to
Cycling West. The output in 1896 was
about 1,000,000 wheels, worth $60,000,000.
The exports of 1896 for the first half of the
year reached $1,654,291, and the expecta
tion is that 50,000 American wheels will be
sold in England alone in 1897. Turee mil
lion wheels are in use in the United States,
a proportion of one to every twenty-lour of
the population. In France the proportion
is only one in 250.
The pool tournament at the Bay City
Club is progressing and has excited in
tense interest among the members. The
billiard-room is crowded nightly with
critics who cannot play themselves, but
have their own ideas how shots should be
made and never iail to express them
when a player misses. The score thus far
is as follows:

A player losing three games is out of the
tournament, and Fred Day, one of the
.-â cratch men, is the first. Day plays an
excellent game, but his poor luck, coupled
with a tendency to get "rattled" at criti
cal moments, told against him. Among
possible winners of thje tonrnanjent are
Pike, Kellom, Leavittand Mervy. A good

The League of American Wheelmen
now numbers 09,998 members, of whom
1628 are from this division. A correspond
ent writes to inquire of me the name of
the division official organ. It is the Olym
pic ido not know why the organ tailed
to publish the list of newly elected divi
sion officials, or why it never publishes
any league news nowadays. Ask the San
Jose correspondent of Cycling West. The
official organ is to be changed next month
vrith the beginning of the new league
year, and then, perhaps, the members wid
g^t their news more regularly and com
pletely.
T"Â»e chance that there will be a cut in
the price of really high-grade wheels for
next season is slight indeed. Some wheels
will be cut, of course, but a first-class arti
cle will always bring a good price, and this
refers to bicycles as well as anything else.
There will be plenty of cheap'wheels, but
the shoddy bicycle hns had its day, and
macnines of recogn.'zed make and merit
will have the call t/sreafter.
Secretary-Treasurer Scovern of the league
in this State, has issued the following
notice to members regarding road books:
All members of this division who have not
received a copy of tne 1895 edition road book
and desire a copy of the 189G road book, can
have same upon application to me, free.
Those members who 1 aye received a copy of
the 1895 edition road book and desire a copy
of the 189ti edition also, can have same upon
filing an application with me, and by further
paying 50 cents, this being the sum agreed
u> m by the executive committee at a meeting
cai ed for the purpose of arranging delivery
of road books.
The above charge was deemed necessary,
owing to the great cost ot issuing this 1896
edition, and to the further fact that the great
majority of our members have already been
supplied with copies of the 1895 edition.
As there are but 2000 copies on hand, mem
bers would be sure of securing a copy by im
mediate application. Stanley G. EftlVJUm.

of a place in the finals when in condition,
and with a little more training and ex
perience can be counted on to show in

RING AND GLOVE.
It Is Thought the Sharkey and Fltz
slmmons Fight May End Quick y.
It would not be shooting far off the mark
by stating that no greater interest has
been taken in contests pugilistic since the
time that Corbett was matched to fight
Sullivan, than there is at present in the
coming match between Fitzsimmons and
Sharfcey.
The sporting people of Australia, Eng
land and America are interested in the
outcome of this great event, and as a con
sequence every little notice that the papers
publish concerning the fighters and their
ways of training, etc, is read.
Sharkev is comparatively a new man in
the fistic business, but he has made such
rapid strides within a year that the
skeptics are puzzled and hesitate to give
an opinion. Of course it is the consensus of
opinion that FitZHimmons will win be
cause of his many victories at home and
abroad over men who were rated being
most iormidable opponents.
bince Fitz developed from a middle
THE SAN" FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 28. 1896.
weight into a heavy â¢ weight he has
whipped Peter Maher, Joe Choynski and
other fighters of prominence rather easily;
therefore it is no great wonder that a
large percentage of people interested in
fi-t icuffs look forward to the defeat of the
sailor on the evening of December 2.
But the Sharkey side of the question
must be given consideration before any
rash surmises are made regarding the out
come of this great contest, which may,
after all, afford the sporting world a
strange bit of surprise, as the unexpected
not infrequently happens within the
"squared" circle. Allowing that Fitzsim
mons has defeated two of the leading
lights among the heavy-weight division
of fighters, is that a reason why he should
be booked as a 3 to 1 Â«hot over the sailor?
The latter has met and practically de
feated pugilists of even greater renown
than those whom his opponent sent to
grass.
With all due respect to that game and
clever pugilist Joe Cboynsui, Sharkey did
not, receive just treatment wen they met
in Mechanics' Pavilion In the first
round Joseph banged Thomas- around the
ring as he t leased, but when the sailor re
tired to his corner he quickly concluded
that a stand-off fight would result "disas
trously to him, and when these cond round
was called he charged at his opponent
iuily determined to stan I his ground, and
play a game of give and take.
In the mixture Shancey hit Choynski a
short-arm blow in the pit of the stomach,
which doubled Joseph up, jack-knife
shape, and the referee immediately
stepped between the contestants and or
dered them to their corners.
Choynski resorted to a very cunning
subenuge to gain time, as bis pipes were
greatly impaired. After a good rest the
contest was allowed to so on, and nothing
vi a very exciting nature resulted until
the last round of *he engagement, when
there was a lively mix-up, in which
Sharkey gave as good as he receieved. In
fact he was much the fresher man when
the gong sounded the end of the milL
Choyuski, for some reason best known
to himself, did not appear to be particu
larly anxiouH for a return match with tne
sailor, although the latter made known
his desires to meet his opponent at any
place suitable to Joseph and his manager.
The National Club was figuring on giving
a lame purse for a second meeting be
tween Sharkey and Choynstci or Sharkey
and Peter Maher, when CorDett dropped
into town, ostensibly on a visit to his rela
tives and friends.
One evening when Corbett was feeling
in good humor, presumably after a French
dinner, he remarked in his brother's sa
loon that he wouldn't ask for a better
thing than an opportunity to BtopSl;arkey
in lour rounds. Of course the news was
quickly conveyed to Sharkey and his
manager, Dan Lynch. The sailor natur
ally grew indignant and insisted on his
manager interviewing Corbett, aud if pos
sible to get his signature to an agreement.
After much bantering and bickering
articles were drawn up and signed. What
was the result? Why, everybody who
was supposed to Know anything" about
rinji matters predicted a decidedly easy
victory for the champion.
Many local sports who are considered
close observers and good judges of fisti
cuffs stated openly that Corbett would
whip the audacious sailor in a couple of
punches, and even some went so far as to
say that in condition or out of condition
Corbeit could easily dispose of Sharkev
with one band free and the other "tied
behind bis back."
Oi Corbett it must be said that he was
not in first-class shape when he faced the
sailor's music Jim rated Sharkey an easy
game, that could be easily captured by a
clever exponent of the manly art, and he
trained just sufficient to dispose of what
he believed Sharkey to be â "a big, husky
fellow whose knowledge of boxing was
very limited.
Although far from perfect, "the profes
sor" was not by any means in Door condi
tion. Members of the Olympic Club with
wnom Corbett exercised will not hesitate
to say that the champion trained hard,
and was in pretty fair condition to go a
stiff len-round fistic argument.
A few days previous to :he fight he
boxed three men. going each man a sharp
four-round, and immediately after tbia he
played several hard games of handball
witn two of the leading players of the
club and then did not, apparently, feel
the effects of the severe exercise.
Unless Jim was is in tolerably good form
he certainly could not have stood a heavy
strain on his constitution without showing
the effects, ypt four rounds with the dough
ty sailor disrupted all of Corbett's fondest
calculations and placed bim in such a
position that the sporting people actually
took pity on him.
In the last two rounds of the fight he
resorted to strategy, and by desperate
hugging and clinching he remained on
his pins until the gong saved him from
what came within an ace of being a fear
ful defeat.
Corbett certainly underrated Bharkey in
many ways, but what astonished him
most of all was the sailor's phenomenal
ability to take heavy punishment and
then return to the scratch like a roaring
lion for more medicine. Corbett hit the
muscular mariner several blows that
would put to sleep most fighters of the
present day, and doubtless the result dis
heartened the *inÂ» of the heavy-weights.
Now the question risked is: Can Fitz
simmons hit the sailor hard enough to
stop his rushes? The general opinion is
that the elongated Cornisbman can do it,
but unless the trick is accomplished inside
of four rounds Sharkey will prove to be
the winner of the right.
The retired blacksmith is, however, very
confident of capturing the $10,000 prize
pot, and he has stated to frends that he
will put an end to the sailor's hornpipes
the first good opening that will be given
bim to uppercut his man.
"I have a pretty good idea," said Fitz,
"of how Sharfcey intends to fight me. I
expect that he will charge like a Texas
bull with head down the instant the gong
sounds the attack. I understand that he
will hold his left arm in such a manner as
to protect his chin and the right will be
used as a weapon for administering
punishment.
"This is all well and good and may do
for Cori ett, Choynski and others, but you
can bet dollars to doughnuts that I will
bring that left arm down the first sma9h I
give the champion sailor in the short ribs.
Then you will see how he will hold his
chin, the point of which I will touch
gently; yes, gently enough to satisfy
Sharkey that he was never born to become
a champion pugilist."
Sharkey will doubtless feel amused at
this. Tom is as confident of whipping
Fitzsimmons as he is of entering the ring
on next Wednesday evening. He expects
to stop some heavy blows, but if con
fidence will win him a victory the Cornish
man will not come up for the second round
at the call of time.
The National Club, under whose aus
pices the fight will take place, is certainly
deserving oi commendation lor its untiring
and faithful efforts in briniring before ti>e
sporting people of this City the foremost
renters of the land in limited round con
tests. In fact there is not a club west of
tne Rocky Mountains that would dream
of offering a purse of $10,000 for a contest
between any two men, it matters not
what their reputations as pugilists may be.
The club is aware that the sporting people
of this City have the utmost confidence in
its integrity and ability to conduct boxing
entertainments, whicn will be free irom
the least suspicion of hippodrome, and it
therefore feels as if it will receive suffi
cient financial support to engage the best
fistic talent procurable and that all great
contests will be held in this City under its
management in the future.
Ryau, the pugilist, who is to meet
lracey Monday night, is a comparatively
new man, but a glance at his record
shows a straight string of knockouts
against middle-weights, heavy-weights
and all sorts of weights.
It is said that the winner will b
matched against Walcott for a large purse
and the world's championship.

The ring and seats have been so ar
ranged in Union Hall that a fine view of
the contests can be had from any part of
the house. The hall has been specially
renovated for the occasion, and the
Golden West Club can be congratulated
on the appearance of its headquarters.
HANDBALL.
Young Men Who Are Rapidly Com-
Insr to the Frontâ A Tournament.
The old vets who play handball will
soon have to give way to the lads who are
rapidly forging to the front.
Some years ago when a man of between
20 and 40 years of age could use both his
left and right bands to good advantage he
was looked upon as a phenomenon. In

fact, the handball players, with few ex
ceptions â that is, prior to Jones' arrival â
relied solely on the execution they could
do with their "rights" to win a rub. The
left hand was used as a sort of scoop to
catch balls that could not be taken very
well with the right. The great Australian
player revolutionized things, so to speaK,
and he was not many months living
under American colors when left-handed
plÃyors loomed up on all s.des.
Jones taught many young men how to
play ball properly, and to-day the best
players in the State are lads about 17 years
of age.
To any lover of the game it is a treat to
see the young idea juggling with the
handball in Phil Ryan's court, on Howard
street. Mr. Ryan states that he will soon
give a handsome cup for a contest be
tween young men of between 16 and 20
years of age, p.nd there is no gainsaying
the fact that a tournament in which young
men contest for supremacy will prove far
more interesting than games that are wit
nessed almost daily between men who
have seen better days.
The San Francisco handball court man
agement states that a particularly good
programme has been arranged for to
morrow, and all lovers of the pastime are
invited to be present.
J. McKeon challenges J. Kilgallon to a
game of handball at the Eureka court,
best three out ol five, the victor to re
ceive the Eureka court gold medal, now
held by McKeon. Kilgallon is the ama
teur champion of Denver.
GUN AND GAME.
The Cold Snap Has Improved Duck
Shooting: In the Marshes.
The sportsmen who left this City last
Saturday evening for their respective
hunting quarters in the marshes congrat
ulated each other on the excellent pros
pects for bagging much game on the day
following.
The weather was what old hunters pro
claimed as being real "duck weather," but
for some reason best known to the web
footers of the swamp lands there were
few ducks in sight on the day that the
sportsmen expected to reap a big harvest
of broad bill-.
Why the birds vacated the swamps on
Sunday is explained by Billy Murdock,
the famous duck caller of the Sonoma
marshes. Murdock says that during his
forty years' experience in duck-shooting
he cannot remember of a season when the
birds remained in the marshes after the
first good rainstorm.
"It stands to reason," said Billy, the
mallard caller, "that all of the broad-bill
family of quackers are fond of greens, and
when the opportunity arrives :or a mess
they don't hesitate in' breaking away from
the marshes and paying tbeir best re
spects to the gren fields, where they
win-ale and quack all night long and
return at early morn to tue bay."
The sharp north wind of the past few
days will materially improve the sport of
duck-shooting on the marshes. In fact,
first-class results were had by some hunt
ers who were out shooting on Thursday,
and according to the present outlook the
rubber-booters who will be in the marshes
to-morrow morning should return well
satisfied with their outing.
In the vicinities of Antioct and Rio
Vista thousands of wild ducks, principally
widgeon, sprig and blackjacks, have been
-een during the week, and the market
hunters are repairing to those places whf re
the ducks find rest during the day. John
Lemmer of this City bagged seventy-three
birds near Antioch on Thursday, and he
reports that good shooting was had all
along the river. Two men who were
snipe-shooting near Rio Vista last
Wednesday Dagged 196 birds, and they
reported never haying seen English snipe
so plentiful. They discovered the long
bills in a field that was recently plowed.
It is said that first-class snipe-shooting
can be had near Suisun. In fact, the
birds have become very numerous every
where since the cold snap arrived.
It is stated on pood authority that the
keepers in the Suisun marshes scatter
broken glass along the trails tramped over
by poachers, and that several hunting
boots have been cut recently. The hunt
ers are of the opinion that the club men
are resorting to very small schemes to
gain a point, but they say the game will
work two ways.
The Sportsmen's Protective Association
wiil make a strong fight at the next ses
sion of the State Legislature to have passed
a bill that will combine in one enactment
ail the present game and fish laws, with
clauses covering the many defects in the
laws now in force. The bill, it is said,
will create one ohief warden, to receive a
small salary, who will have the power to
employ sub-wardens, to be paid only for
the actual time they work. A legislative
committee will be appointed at the next
monthly meeting of the association, which
will be next Tuesday evening.
The director-general of the Mallard Gun
Club, Bill Nye Esq., announces that a
grand "tea," in honor of the fourth anni
versary of the duck-shooting season, will
be given on board the battle-ship "Aerial
Monster" on to-morrow (Saturday) even
ing at 11:59 o'clock. The ship is anchored
in Cordelia slough, Suisun marsh.
JuseDh Phillips, a Justice of the Peace
at Raritan, N. J., must be given credit for
devising a novel method for calling the
attention of Hunters to the game laws of
that State. The other day he hung a
placard on the outer wall of his office to
which was attached a woodpecker, ana be
*neatb the bird, neatly lettered, was the
following: "This bird cost a poor Italian
hunter $2175. Ye who are ignorant of
the game laws of this State take warning."
Instead of hanging out placards, ala
Joseph Phillips of Ilaritan, N. J., the Jus
tices of this place generally send notices
to s;ame-dealers arrested for transgressing
the gome laws to come and see them.
Wild pigeons are very plentiful near
Mill Valley, and hunters who have just
returned from Point Reyes report having
seen large flocks flying over the Country
Club's preserve.

THE ANGLER.
A New Manager Will Soon Take
Charore of Point Reyes Hotel.
Midwinter anglers who take pleasure in
standing on the bank of a river on a cold
day and watching, freauently for hours at
a time, the tip of their rods in expectation
of a sudden "yank" from a denizen of the
deep, are now making ready for a visit to
some of those localities where the arrival
of Mr. Steelhead is daily expected.
Latest intelligence from Duncans Mills
states that a recent rise in the Kussian
River, which wait caused by the late rain
storm, will materially improve the sport
of angling. The river is at present clear
ing rapidly, and Mr. Morgan oi Duncans
Mills is sanguine that a week hence first
class fishing will assuredly result, as the
bar is open and quite a number of fish
have lodged in the deep pools near the
mouth of Austin Creek.
Last Sunday two steel cads were caught
in Tamaipais Creek that scaled respect
ively two and three and a quarter pounds.

BUTTER-STREET EXTENSION-
Richmond Wants That. Thoroughfare
Opened Through Laurel Hill.
At a meeting of the Richmond District
Improvement Association held Thursday
evening in Simmons Hall, corner of
Fourth avenue and California street, a
resolution was adopted calling for the
closing of the cemeteries in the City; also
for a strict enforcement of ordinance 2950,
approved January 31, 1896, prohibiting the
sale of burial lots in those places of inter
ment. A committee was appointed to
prepare and present to the coming Legis
lature a bill for the accomplishment of
this object.
A resolution was also adopted favoring
the increase of pay of men engaged in
sweeping the streets by hand from $1, the
present rate per diem, to $2. It is the
unanimous feeling of the association that
the present pay is too small and tends to
degrade the labor of the sweepers, many
of whom are men with families and to
tally without other means oi support.
The proposed extension of Sutter street
through Laurel Hill â¢ Cemetery and into
Richmond District was discussed at
length. It was stated by several members
present that no important graves in plata
were on the line of the street except that
of David â  Broderick. This large monu
ment of the dead statesman need not be
moved, as it would stand exactly in ' the

A British Consul Submits a

That in these modern days the Govern- '

promises to be an aid in prosecuting war,
or which may in any way benefit their
armies, is shown by the novel suggestion
contained in the subjoined extracts from
British official records:

My Lordâ l have the honor to bring
under your lordship's notice, in the event
j 'that it may prove useful to her Majesty's
| War Office, the great powers of endurance
I and strength in lifting heavy loads } and
transporting them to long distances in
this tropical .. climate possessed by the
West African negroes in tnese parts,
which personal observation and conversa-
tion with them and West African traders
who visit this port enaDies me to attribute
to the free use of the stercuha bean, which
I learn is now being introduced into the
Frencn army after research, study and ex- T '
periments made at Marseilles by Dr.
Heckle, professor of science of the Medical
Academy there. The West Indian car-
riers at this port, who use sterculia and
carry the bean wrapped in banana about
their person, are, as a whole, " not, physi-
cally speaking, superior men to the Bra-
zilian negro, and yet the African, through
constantly masticating sterculia, can en-
dure labor and fatigue which the Brazilian
carrier cannot withstand. These beans,
which are not intoxicating and in no way
injurious, act as a nutritive, quench thirst
and produce vigor and freshness. I

The product of the seeds or nuts alluded
to is known to civilization as Kolafra, the
article called V.no Kolafra being ' the
standard preparation of it. Vino Kolafra
possesses all the stimulating and strength-
ening properties of the nut itself, and is
used and commended .by athletes, in.
valid*, employers of labor, business men
leading members of the learned profes-
sions and all who need a safe and certain
invigorant and tonic.
It occupies a wholly exceptional dosi.
won among stimulants in that it produces
a pervading and sustained effect not fol-
lowed' by the depression or reaction in-
separable from all other-. :
The introduction to civilization of the
sterculia fruit in a practical form is due to
the efforts , of the - Brunswick Pharmacal
Company of 92 William street. New York
whose experiments in the tropical home
of the tree, covering a period of several
years, have been frequently referred to by v
the press throughout the country.
It strengthens and regulates the action
of the heart, deepens the breathing, re-
rains the waste of tissue and nerve force
under unusual exertion, and develops a
degree of physical and psychical power
which surprises all who experience or witÂ«
ness it. ;
Physicians have commended it for use
in cases of anaemia and weakness from
any form of functional debility or nerv-
ous prostration. For chronic invalids
and those who are slowly- convalescing
after acute illness there is nothing to com-
pare with it in the list of remedies.
In fact, Vino Kolafra is in some mys-
terious way a renewer of vitality, a tonic
in the highest meaning of the. word; and
if Governments find it helpful to armies in
the field it is certainly an equally impor-
tant aid in the hard campaign of life.

â¢ The' Harbor Commissioners held a
'lengthy session yesterday. A communi
cation was received from the New York
Commissioners.' stating that all United
"States vessels were charged wharfage. In
. consequence the same rule will be followed
here. Latterly revenue vessels and United
'State lighthouse tenders have only been
charged halt rates. Now all of them will
have io pay like other craft.
The branch postoffice at the foot of Mar
ket street â  has no beating apparatus and
. in consequence the carriers and distrib
utors suffer on cold mornings. Yesterday
â¢ was 'the climax, and they got up a peti
tion to Postmaster McCoppin setting forth
their woes. When the Postmaster - re
eived the communication he was suffering
' from a severe attack of inflammatory rheu
matism; nevertheless he got out of bed
and- went to the meeting of the Harbor
Commissioners. He explained that Uncle
Sam was poor, but that the coal would be
supplied if the State would put up a stove
in the main room of the building. Colnon
looked at Cole, Cole looked at Cbadbourne
and then all three smiled.
' The., petition was read and Chief En
gineer Holmes remarked that there was a
big stqve on which the board was paying
storage, so on the motion of Mr. Cole and
the unanimous vote of the board it was
ordered into service. -
'SChief Engineer Holmes reported that

Judge CoSey lost his breath for a
moment yesterday morning, and ex-Judge
Van Reynegom for a like period of time
stood speechless, as Dr. Campbell Ford
cwlmly staled the items in his claim
against the estate of Mrs. Caroline Tab-r,
deceased. The bill from June 29 to July
3of this year was $1555. at the end of
which tim- the patient died. The doctor
was not asked how much he would have,
charged if she had got well under his
ministrations.
Dr. Ford's bill of particulars is as fol
lows:

This was sworn to before Lee D. Craig,
notary public
Attorney Herman gently sugjrÂ°sted to
Dr. /ord that the court would like to
have an explanation of the charges in the
bill, and Judge Coffey confessed to some
slight curiosity on the subject.
Mr. Van Eeyneaom drew attention to
tbe fact that Dr. Ford's bill for attending
J. E. Taber, d ceased, formerly husband
of Caroline Taber, deceased, from June
to July 2 was $770. Tbe claim was allowed
for $140 by the administratrix. In Mr.
Van Keyneirom'B opinion all services ren
dered to Mrs. Taber prior to her husband's
death should be cnarged to her husband's
estate, and only the services rendered
after J. E. Taber's death should be
charged to the estate of Caroline Taber.
He said that according to Dr. Ford's bills
in the two separate estates. Caroline
Tuber died one day later than J. E. Taber,
her husband. He asked to have the ac
count remodeled in that regard, and re
served any objection to tbe items nntii
that should be done.
"Then both Mr. Taber and his wife were
sick at tbe same time and were treated
simultaneously by you?" asked Judge
Coffey, who evinced a <le9ire to under
stand the basis of the charges before the
bills were reconstructed.
"Both sick at tbe same time and both
treated at the same time." replied Dr.
Ford.
"Both in the same house?"
"Yes; both in the same bed."
"Tht! same bed?"
'â¢Yes."
"Well, well," said the Judge in astonish
ment, but tbe probate record discloses the
fact that they didn't get well.
Returning to the attack Judge Coffey
said : "I s>e you have charged at the iate
ol $20 an hour for attendance on Caroline
Tauer. Did you charge $20 an hour for
attendance simultaneously on J. E.
Taber T"
"OÂ» course," replied Dr. Ford cheerfully.
"But doesn't it make a difference when
yoa are treating two persons like that at
the same time?"
"Certainly not," loftily.
"How do you explain that?" inquired
tbe Judge in his most insinuating tones.
"Both wore sick at tbe same time and
both had to be treated at tbe iiame time,"
slowly explained tbe witness, as if to
allow bis words to penetrate the judicial
brain.
"Then you charged double, or at the
rate of $40 an hour?" persisted Judge
Coffey.
'â¢To be sure." somewhat curtly replied
Dr. Ford. He appeared bored to learn
that anyoody should think it necessary to
ask so many questions regaraing a trival
matter,
"I tind one item of $1100 which includes
eight consultations and, as you say, fifty
live hours' continuous attendance. Now
do you mean for the court to understand
that you were actually in attendance fifty
five consecutive hours?" was Judge Cof
fey's next suggestion.
"Yes."
"And you didn't sleep any during that
time?"
"I don't think I slept more than an hour
or two."
"Well, if you slept two hours that will
admit of some reduction in that report."
"It wasn't over one hour that I slept."
"Even one hour will make some differ
ence," was tbe court's pitiless remark.
Mr. Van Reymgom next tried his hand
at pruning the bill. He suggested that in
tbe charges for consultation with other
piiyaicians Dr. lord's ciiarge would in
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 28, 1896.
clude the bills of those other physicians
and that the estate would not be called on
tor additional claims. If Mr. Van Reyne
gom had entertained any such hope bis
mind was quickly disabused, for Dr. Ford
assured him that every doctor is fuliy
competent to make out his own bill, and
that he was not collecting the claims of
his associates in tbe case.
In reply to Attorney Herman Dr. Ford
said he considered his bill very rea
sonable, under the circumstances, laying
special stress on the word "circum
stances."
Judge Coffey mused a moment over his
inkwell and somewhat hesitatingly said:
"I understand that you oueht to charge in
accordance w;th the richness of tbe pa
tient. How much 13 this estate worth,
anyhow? 1 '
Mr. Van Reynegom said that the estates
were wo-th each about $4000.
Dr. Ford did not think this cut any
figure, as tbe heir to tbe estate is a lady
who maintains a handsome establisbinen t
at NewDort.
Judge Coffey admitted that that might
make a difference. A Newport establish
ment is a thing to be considered. He said
he aid not like to cut down doctors' bills,
but thought it right to take a few days to
think the matter over.
AN EARLY BAY BATH,
Ex-Assemblyman Joseph Marks Stum
ble* Off Clay-Sireet Wharf
Yesterday Morning.
Ex-Assemblyman Joseph Marks went
down to the foot of Clay street yesterday
morning at about 2:30 o'clock and took a
dip in the bay. He was seen by a boat
man, who, with the help of two police of
ficers, fished the drowning man out of the
chilling water. He was taken to the Re
ceiving Hospital and thawed out in a
warm bed. He explained his presence on
the wharf at such an unusual hour by
saying that be was searching fora friend
and in tbe darkuess stumbled and fell
overboard.
Marks appeared to be considerably rat
tied and explained bis mental derange
ment by stating that ever since he fell
from a streetcar about a year ago, from
which he received considerable injury, his
head is "not quite right."
When seen at bis residence yesterday
alternoon he had not quite recovered from
his Dlunge in tbe bay and seemed to be
unable to recall much that happened pre
vious to his fall off the wharf. He denied,
however, that be intended to commit sui
cide and adhered to bis version of the ac
cident
Mr. Marks represented the Forty-third
Assembly District in the Legislature two
years ago, and was quite active as a poli
tician. Since his streetc r mishap, which
laid him up for some time with an injured
ankle, he has not been in any business,
and it is thought that lie had become de
spondent over his misfortunes.
BAD OETHOGRAPHY.
Careless Spelling in a Wilt Causes
Much Trouble in the Probate
Court.
' Samuel M. Shortridge appeared in Judge
Coffey's court yesterday afternoon in the
matter of the estate of Joshua Hendy. ' It
appeared that certain legatees wished to
borrow money to buy out and compromise
with the other legatees. Mr. Shortridge
stated that he represented a capitalist
who was to advance the money for that
purpose.
"Have you the money with you?" asked
Jud c Coffey jocosely.
"I have, your Honor," replied Mr. Short
ridge. .. - .
Mr. Shortridge explained that he had no
interest in the matter further than that,
and if the matter could be adjusted so that
the court might- make a decree of partial
distribution he was ready to hand over the
money.
But the counsel on both sides of the case
could not agree as to the meaning of the
will. . It directed the distribution of "one
fifteth" of certain property, and as the
spelling in the will was very bad, "debt"
being spelled "det," the court was not
able to say whether the deceased meant
' # *one-fi(tieth" or "one-nfth."
â¢ The lawyers were also divided in opinion
and the matter went over.

The first meeting of the Anti-Saloon
League of this locality was held in tbe Y.
M. C A. Hall yesteiday afternoon. There
were present representatives from many
denominations and temperance organiza
tions.
The organization of a provisional com

operating church or other society. Rev.
Dr. Caluoun was made temporary chair
man and Rev. Robert Whitacer of East
Oakland secretary.
Another meeting of this organization

this meeting there will be a good repre
sentation trom all churches, temperance
organizations or other societies which are

GREER HARRISON
AT THE FINISH
He Did Walk Fifty Miles
od His Sixtieth Birth
day.
An Average of Three Miles an
Hour ior Seventeen Con
secutive Hours.
la Fine Form When He Reached the
Hotel V. N ome at n o'Clock
Last Might
On the minute of 6 a. m. yesterday Wil
liam Gretr Harrison started from Tenth
and Howard streets on his tramp to San
Jose. He fixed tbe pace at fonr miles an
hour and easily maintained that speed to
San Mateo, twenty miles away.
Mr. Harrison's idea of walking fifty
miles on his sixtieth birthday was to
demonstrate that a man who has had
proper athletic training between the years
of 16 and 20 should possess at the age of
60 the endurance of youth.
He told his fri nds at the Bohemian
Club that be expected to finish tbe fiftieth
mile within thirteen hours alter starting,
but assured th m that he would not
punish bimsMf to make this time. He
said he would rest if he became wedry, but
would not rest lone enough to allow his
musciet to stiffen.
Men who are quite familiar with Mr.
Harrison know that he is spirited and
plurky. He is the sort of a man who
woulu endure the greaiest fatigue rather
than admit the word "fail" to liis lexicon.
His arrival at San Jose at 9 o'clock was
expected at the Bohemian Club, so when
the hour of 10 came without any announce
ment from the Garden City of tbe pedes
trian's advent some uneasiness was mani
fested. An hour later a message came to
the club by telephone that Harrison had
just arrived at the Hotel Vendome in fine
condition. According to programme he
took a bath and went to bed.
Making allowance for stops it can easily
be reckoned that the pedestrian of three
score avera crt three miles per hour for
â¢â evpnteen consecutive hours. The Hotel
Vendome, ban Jose, is exactly fifty miles
from Tenth and Howard streets, San Fran
cisco. Mr. Harrison bad a perfect day for
his jaunt. Tbe sky was cloudless, the air
cool and braciue.
LOST HIS WAY.
Harrison Ended His W Ik in Santa
Clara and Reached San Josa
on the Cars.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Nov. 27. â William
Greer Harrison reached the Hotel Ven
dome to-night at 11:57, nearly four houis
behind the time in he hoped
to arrive here, but his delinquency
was due not to a miscalculation of
his abilities as a pedestrian but
to tbe fact that about eight miles
from this city the party lost its way in the
darkness and made a detour which added
about eight miles to the journey. Instead
of completing the half-century in this
city, therefore, as planned, the walk was
terminated at Santa Ciara, three miles
distant. The trip here from Santa Clara
was made by electric-car. Mr. Harrison
claims he made the fifty miles in thirteen
hours, one hour less than was anticipated.
Mr. Harri-on showei little signs or
fatigue after bis long trir>, and was cer
tainly no worse for his walK than were
bin three companions, who were all young
and hearty athletes. He chatted merrily
of his experiences en route, and ex
pressed himself as thoroughly satinfied
with the exposition he bad made of what
a long life of correct habits and athletic
training could accomplish. Ha promises
to make the trip again, and the next time
he declares he will accomplish the feat in
twelve hours actual walking time. Next
time he says he will do a little active
training before undertnKine the walk.
Explicit.
"What you want to do," said the old
politician to tbe young man who had vol
unteered to do missionary work among
the voters in a remote section of the coun
try, "is to make yourself personally popu
lar. If you can make peopie like you
they're almost sure to vote your way."
"Yes, I suppose so. You mean that I
an' to cultivate an unaffected style of
speaking, and that I am to use 'small
words and pat my arguments into homely
phrase wherever it is tossibie to do so. I
am to sedulously avoid anything, either in
the matter of my discnurse or in the man
ner ol its delivery, which may be beyond
the comprehension of my audience, or
which may possibly create a prejudice
against me, because in the opinion of my
audience it savors of affectation."
Tbe oid-time politician dropped into his
Chair and looked weary.
"No," he said, emphatically, "that is
not it at all."
â¢'Have I misunderstood your instruc
tions?"
"You have. What I mean is that when
ever a woman holds a baby un at you you
have to chuck it under the chin and kiss
it, and whenever you see a man with a
dog jou have to stoD and tell the owner
that it's one of the finest thoroughbred
specimens you eyÂ»r laid your eyes on.
That's what I mean."â Detroit Fret r*ress.
THE HARD FATE
Of JOHN IRWIN
While Working in a Nickel
Mine He Lost His
Eyesight.
Finally Deserted Here, as He
Supposed, H3 Tcok
Aconite.
By Great Effort His Life Was Saved
and Now Friends Are Trying
to H.'ip Him.
A subscription is being raised at the
Brooklyn Hotel in aid ot John Irwin, the
blind miner who, through discouragement at
the loss of bis sight and the impending
danger of being deserted by all who knew
him. attempted to take his life by aconite a
few days ago. The total amount subscribed,
however, is as yet but $30.
The money is to pay the expenses ol the un
fortunate miner at one of the hospitals, while
Dr. Powers, the oculist, Is treating his eyes.
Dr. Powers thinks there Is a faint chance for
Irwin to recover his sight, at least partially,
In [one eye, and accordingly the oculist will
begin treating him. Ue has agreed to do so,
too, without cost
Mr. Irwin is at present at the Salvation
Army barracks, 120 Oregon street Tbe army
peoplo are looking after him and doing all
they can for him.
The story of Mr. Irwin's misfortunes is a
pathetic one. He Is but 35 years old and is &
large, handsome man. He arrived here last
spring from near Lovelock, Nev., where be had
been working in a nickel mine. There had
been an explosion In the mine, and it wu in
this that he lost bit, sight.
Clerk F. B. Middlecoff ot the Brooklyn yes
terday toid about the hard fate of Irwin.
"He was working in a nickel mine owned by
the Nevada Nickel Mining Company and situ
ated abmn twenty ini.es from Lovelock," said
Mr. Middlecofl. "when this explosion occurred.
"The injury sustained whb very great. Mr.
Irwin, whose eyes had been destroyed, was
left twenty-three days before he received at
tention.
"Then some Lovelock people heard of him
and went up and brought him down. They
and the people connected with the mine
brought him to the American Exchange Hotel.
He remained there till they g>t read u> tear
the botel down and then he came to the
Brooklyn to live. He arrived on August 14
and from that time to November 17, when we
missed him, his bill amounted lo between $S0
and $90.
"We had not presented a bill to him, but In
some way he heard that the peop.e < ounected
with the mine bad gone back on him and re
fused to give him any aid. He looked upon
himself as an outcast, blind and helpiess, bo
he >;ot a youug lellow he knew to buy some
aconite at Wakelec's drugstore.
"When he got this he went to bis room, took
the pcii-on and lay down on the bed to die.
The chambermaid went to his room, but cou.d
not get In. Finally, after -everd attempts,
she came to me. It was about 4 o'clock in tbe
afternoon. I went uMothe room ana found
the door locked so.id.y, but by the aid ol a
boy I opened tne transom and finally got tbe
door open.
"Irwin was in a bad fix, but I got a doctor,
and after a while he brought him around.
Since tben the Sa.vation Army has taken him
in charge. We are, vow tryiug to get enough
money to pay his expenses at the bosi ltal
while Dr. Powers treats bis eyes. The doctor
has hopes thai bo can save the sight of one
eye. or at least a litteof it. Irwiu is a tine
young man and was well lilted here. He Â»oon
learned to go upstair* to his room and get
Â«boui without any beip, but the leeling that
he had lost his sight forever and was deserted
by all was too much for him."

AGAINST THE MILITARY.
Trade and Labor Alliance Disapprove

At a meeting of the San Francisco Trade and

last night, the owing preamble and resolu

Whebkar. The Interests of the workers of the

opposed to bo internal . and external warfare
with Us long train of evils, chief among which arÂ»
tbe wholesale slaughter of me workers themselves

maintained for the defense of dead issues, but tor
something more imminent and perilously present,
namely, the growii.g irritation between labor and
capitalâ more i rop rly speaking, between laborer
and . capitalistâ provoked by - the daily - divorce
ment of the workers of be world from the m ans
of production, and the consequent lack of natural
opportunity to make a . living on a plune of social
dignity commensurate with the requirements of
the enlightened civilization of which they are a
part; and whereas, it is well known by a 1 intelli
gent worklngmen, that the present activity in the
army and navy of the United Mates, ostensibly
for the - defense of the Ration â  from foreign
attack, but really to coerce, labor . and to
subdue its interests to -hat, of capitalâ is
a portent of - approaching civil trouble
whico the power-loving arrogance of

SOAKED THE CLUB MEN.
A Lucklpss Palace Guest Poured Water
on the I nion League Member*.
Repairs are to be made in tbe bar and
billiard room of the Union League Club
in the Palace Hotel. On the night before
Thanksgiving the people of the club were
treated to an entertainment that was not
expec ea and which was not received with
welcome. They were deluged with water
from above, and now they are cleaning
and renovating and preparing to calci
mine and paint anew and get a new
carpet and billiard Hoths.
A thoughtle>s uueat on the half floor of
tbe Palace, just auove this part of the
club, went to sleep on the evening in ques
tion leaving the water running in* his
bathtub. It is said that tbe luckless per
son was the famous White Hat McCarty.
Whoever it was the room was wet down in
good shape with nearly all the heredita
m nts and appurtenances thereunto apper
tain in jr.
As Secretary Pippy took a look at it
yesterday he said that the whole room
would have to be fixed up.
"The carpet was ruined," ha said, "and
a whole lot of things were wet down in
such away thnt they were spoiled and will
have to be replaced. Besides this the
ceiling and wails are soaked with water
so that, as the contractors say, they will
have to be plastered and kaisomined
anew. It will cost $200 or $300 at least, I
â UDpose, to nt it up again. Who will foot
the bill? Why, the hotel. It's funny how
this guest forgot himself and let the water
pour over in this way."
The carpet has been torn away, the
various pieces of furniture carried to
another part of the clubrooms, and prep
arations are being made to thoroughly re
pair the damages.
AT THE CHUTES
Hundreds of Children Enjoy the Man)-
fold Attract ons.
The Haight-street grounds were simply
packed with children Thursday afternoon,
over 14,000 enjoying themselves by invita
tion of the management. There were
delegations from the Boys' and Girls'
Hgh Schools, grammer, primary and
night schools, parochial schools, Chinese
missions, and in fact from every educa
tional institution in the City.
"Arion" on his high wire and Pirri on
bis wonderful coast down the chutes on
his bicycle were duly enjoyed, but Emil
Markeberg's balloon ascension was what
they wanted. Great difficulty was experi
enced in filing the big air bag, so tre
mendous was the crowd surging around,
but at half-past four off he went with 10,
-000 yells from 10,000 throats. He landed
safely near Market and Sixteenth streets
with his parachute.
The children caused the management
no trouble and not a single accident took
place.
Ye^ierday afternoon there was a repeti
tion of the Thanksgiving day scene, over
10,000 children being in attendance. A
tremendous crush is expected this after
noon, as it is the last day on which the
50,000 ticket-. sÂ°nt out will hold good.

years and my sou for two y Jars. During that
time I resorted to every remedy known to the
medical profession in this section of the coun
try. In my great anxiety and desire to allevi
ate their suffering I consulted two eminent
doctors In New York, and after several months'
treatment I could discover uo visible improve
men', not saying anything for their recovery.
While '. in â¢ Jefferson, \ Tex.',' some ' two years
slice I happened to mention the condition oi
my wife and son to a leading physician and
druggist. "â 'â¢ He Â»dviÂ»ed me to try Dr. Williams'
Pink Pills for Pale P-ople. * After considerable
persuasion I reluctantly cons led to do to.
At : first I bought . two , packages â  and by the

Is usually accomoanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" us ally first appear on the Washlncton
coast. Wht-n :he pressure is high in the interior
and low along tbe coair, and the isobars extend
north and south alone the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" Is inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of ttregon is improb
able. With a "high" in ibe vicinity of Idano, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result.

DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK, X, V., Nov. 27.-R. O. Dun A Co.
will say to-morrow in their weekly review of trade:
When rush Of orders after the election slacKened,
many began to think business dwlnJling, but sub
sidence of deferred orders is not decrease in busi
ness. DlsaDpolntme:it is observed in Ihe Iron and
steel Industry because various combinations have
been and are still retarding orders by prices which
buyers claim cannot bs maintained, nn I the same
is true in boots and shoes and in a few branches of
textile goods. But business is on tbe whole en
larging, and employment of many more hands will
ex. end purchasing power. The settl men t of the
window-glass con roversy, starting many thou
sands of hands and tbe collapse of some Import
ant Iron combinations with the same effect, give
promise of more business.
Broadly speaking, the gain has been greater
than anybody exptc.ed. and it is nbt suipris ng If
a small part of it is in excess of the present con
suming demand. Xeports from all parU Of the
country show clearly ihe en argement of trad*,
not at all pom s in the same branches, but evi
dently helped i<y a more contident feeling. Mone
tary dlUlcu.ties have vMriaiiaJ t.s if by ma^ic

advices, which have been on the whole less stimu
lating. - -Â» ,
Corn has sympathized with wheat only a little,
and is coming forward freely. The most im
portant factor in the wheat market Is that the
visible supplies do not gain as much an has been
expected. Cotton has valued only a sixteenth of
its considerable : - decline, and , tbe remarkably
heavy < movement pots the speculators - lor an
advance in constant difficulty, and yet tli' re is all
the time to be remembered that the crop was
nearly one month earlier than usual and the
present excess over las', year's movement may be
materially reduced hereafter, Nevertheless, the
fact appears that Northern mills are taking much
less cotton than in previous years and the demand
for goods is evidently disappointing. It cannot
be said that prices in this department are the
hindrance, for even with some recent reduction in
quantities the sales of staple cottons are compara
tively small. ,
Wool is still bought largely for speculation and
earlier purchasers aro holding, but the mills are
not yet doing much more than In Oc.ober. A few
more have been started, but there is scarcely
demand api arent for staple goods. The boot and
shoe industry is : still .hindered by the general
refusal of dealers to pay the advanced prices de
manded by manufacturers except for the limited
quantities which are immediate required, and while
most manufacturers are working on orders taten
weeks ago on lower prices which will keep them
busy for me weeks to come. very little new b jsl
ne>-s is coming in. No further advance of im
portance has been made in leather and the mar
ket for hides has sharply reacted so that the
average of prices is slightly lower than November
12.
The collapse of the nail combination and prob
ably of the beau combination and considerable re
duction in quotations for nails and beans give
reason to look for a larger demand or products of
iron and steel, but at present the sales against
speculative purchases made some time ago are de
pressing prices and Bessemer pig sold at $12 25 and
according to tome reports a little lower at Pitts
burg. The demand for such products as are not
controlled by the combinations is somewhat In
creasing, but by no means as rapidly as expected.
In minor metal) tin Is scarcely as strong us it was
a week ago, but copper and lead ur stro^rer.
Failures for th<Â« week have been 300 in the
United .States against 279 last year and 30 In Can
ada against 47 last year. â

COALâ a local circular says: "During the week
there have been five arrivals from the northern
collieries with 11,798 tons of Coal, which Is a very
small amount to meet our requirements at this
lime of year. The toial amount 'foreign Coal
due to arrive he ret year does not exceed 40,000
tons and all the Coa. from Great Britain and Aus
tralia that can possibly arrive here In January
next will not exceed 30,000 ions more, so that 70,
-00 0 tons in all constitute our visible supply to
February.' 1897. As t .Is only equals about 20
days' consumption, we shall be forced to draw
very generously from our Coast collieries to make
good the deficit and English ' and | Colonial stocks
will have become materially . diminished. This
will lead to an improvement in values, as all ar
rivals of Swansea and Colonial ' after February
next will have been leaded at much higher f reluh'.s
than were prevailing one month ago. 'I'ae quoted
rate this week tor Coal . from Swansea Is 18s tSd V
ton, nearly SI Â¥ ton higher than in October, and
lreiftbts from Newcastle, N. S. W., are 12a 6d, just
2s 6 d higher than four weeks ago. If outward
grain freights remain In the present depressed
condition for several months, as they very prob
ably will, our large consumers of Coal bad better
provide themselves with their fuel requirements
at current rates, as a delay may prove costly to

A Bereaved Cat's Su'cide*
A curious siory of an animal deliber
ately committing suicide comes from a
little village In the western part of this
State. A cat and a dog brought up to
gether were great playmates and very
fond of each oiher. They were the pets
of a family whose borne was not far
from a railroad track, and one day the
do.' raced over the rails too near
an approncbing train, and was struck by
tbe engine and instantly killed. Tbe cat
was in full cbase after him at the mo
ment, and saw her playfellow meet his
death. She was inconsolable, refused her
food and would not run or play about in
answer fo the children's efforts to arouse
her. She strayed often down to the track
where her friend was killed, and finally,
one day, less than a week after the dog's
death, the cat leaped in front of an incom
ing engine and was herself killed.â New

LED TO SUICIDE
Adolphe Tuthe After a Long
. - Life of Honesty Ac
cused of Theft.
Money Sent by a Friend Helped
. .to .Make Things Look Un
pleasant For Him.
When Friends at the Infirmary Bay
c totted Him He Drank L?.udanum
and Died.
Oxklabtd Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Nov. 27, 1896. |
Adolph Tutbe, the aged German who
committed suicide at the County Infirm
ary, was driven to seek death because of a
broken heart.
â¢The 'old man was suspected of being con
cerned in the robbery of another aged man,
â who. died at the infirmary a few days ago,
. ana the' weight of the disgrace was more
than he' could bear.
About a week ago an aged inrcate of the
infirmary was dying. He had $20 in gold,
tied in a handkerchiei around his neck.
Aft.er. he was dead this money was miss
ling- John Heft, another inmate, was ar
frested and is now in custody. After his
arreet he said that Tnihe had stated to
him that he and another man were to rob
the corpse. This was told to Tuthe, and
it affected him greatly.
'â  At the inquest the story of the old
man's troubles leaked out by degrees.
First the disgrace of knowing he was sus-
Adolphe Tuthe, Who Died at the
Infirmary of a Broken Heart.
pected % then the fact that he was ignored
and passed in silence by those who had
for years been his friemis, and then the
k swallowing ot the laudanum.
â Â«^^ Tuthe wa9 a very sensitive old fellow.
He chafed under the thought that after a
long life passed honestly he should find it
necessary to accept the charity of the
county. When to this was added the
contumely of being suspected as a thief it
â was too much. A witness named Me-
Govern told the sad story by degrees as
Coroner Baldwin questioned him.
Heft had told McGovern ail about the
alleged plot to procure that $20 piece from
the neck of the corpse as soon as death
bad come, and later in the day when Mc-
Govern and Tutne met the former had no
word or look of recognition for the latter.
Another circumstance seemed to operate
agaiim Tutbe. A few days previous to
his taking his life a friend sent him .*â *>.
and the r'Oesession of this money seemed
to strengthen the caseagainst the old man.
.It was Tuesday evening when McGovern
passed Tuthe without recognizing him,
and the same night the old man procured
two ounces of laudanum and swallowed it.
He was discovered some hours later, but
life was too near the end to be recalled
and ke died the following day.
.Tuthe was 75 years of age, and had been
well off at one time in his Hie.
A PIONEER OF ALAMEDA.
' Apparently in the Best of Health, W
F. Hitchcock Succumb* to Heart
Trouble.
â¢ A LAMED A, Cal., Nov. 27.â The sudden
death of Wilber F. Hitchcock at Yreka
last evening, where he was attending to
business, as related in this morning's
.dispatches, has cast a gloom over many
ohi-timers of this place.
Mr. Hitchcock came to this city twenty
one years ago and brought up a family of
live .children, all of whom are at present
at the family home They are Mrs. E. R.
Anthony, Mrs. F. R. Ziel, Miss Eva Grace,
f Edgar J. and Waiter K. Hitchcock.
The deceased was a member of the
Pacific Union Salt Company of San Fran
cisco and had traveled for a number of
years for that firm. He covered the ens
ure State on these trips and was known to
almost every business man in the interior.
He left home only two weeks |ago, and a
letter received to-day by his widow stated
that he was in the best of health when it
was written:

ONLY A BOGUS LORD.
Though Stricken Dumb He Tells Storie*
With a Pencil.
OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 27.â Harry Out
ridge, a man who has in times past
achieved mucu notoriety by claiming to
be an English lord, was suddenly struck
dumb early this morning in a tamale par
lor.
Outridge has figured in many unpleas
ant police cases, and has persistently
claimed to be a member of the Scottish
aristocracy. He has been missing from
his usual haunts for some time, and this
morning he was stricken with an apoplec
tic fit in a restaurant For several hours
he was unconscious, and when he re
gained his senses he was unable to apeak
a word.
The shock, however, did not affect bis
mind, for by means of pencil and pa_er
be informed the matron that he was a
nobleman and that if he did not receive
the best of attention the game would be
up with him. Once before he said he had
lost his vuice and had been cured by hav
iug a nerve taken up in his Deck.
When asked if he had enough money to
live on be replied, "Too much."
"For God's Â«ake," he wrote, "keep this
from the papers and from the police and I
w;ll pay you for your trouble." He wrote
frequently for cigarettes and coffee with
cognac, but Steward Victory does not run
a hostelry an_ "Lord Athol" did not re
ceive all he asked.
Mrs. Macdonald, the matron, was very
favorably impressed with his lordship,
and put great faith in his story. Sha was
making preparations to attend to him
commensurate with bis rank, till she heard
a few more chapters of bis story, and then
she again put on her gingham apron,
which had been replaced for the occasion
by one of silk.
BEAUTY, HOT COSTUME.
The Blley Face Admired More Than
the Dillingham Dress.
OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 27.â Mrs. Dil
lingham, Miss Minnie Riley and that
mask aress ball are the sole topics oi con
versation in North Oakland, Golden Gate,
Emeryville and Lorin. The quarrel that
has shaken society in that neighborhood
may yet end in bloodshed.
The matter has now taken a personal ;
turn, and the ladies have been led from :
' costumes to physique and from physique to
; personal looks and beauty. The latest
1 feature must be regarded as the danger
; point, as both ladies a:e very attractive.
Misr- Riley says she won the prize with '
Mrs. Dillingham's dress, but it was the i
I Riley beauty and not the Dillin^ham mode
! that captured the judges.
Now comes Mrs Dillingham and contra*
! diets tho beauty part of the story, and her j
argument on that point seems to be con- j
elusive. She says:
"Wit- regard to the statement that Miss
I Riiey claims she won the prize thrmi v
' her beauty and the manner in which
she displayed ;he dresa therÂ« is not a wurd
:of truth in it and it is absurd. Neither of
I us could have put forward our looks be
j fore the prizes were awarded, as a mask i
j had to be worn until after the merits of
â¢ the costume 3 were passed upon."
A week ago the residents of Golden ;
Gate passed and published a set of resolu
tions relating to the character of one of
their younp;'meri who, it is claimed, had
been "led astray into matrimony by the
wiles of a yrnnp widow," and now it 19
! proposed to handle the mask-ball matter ,
j officially as a town.
HE FOEGOT HIS NAME.
Humorous Predicament or a Prisoner
With an Alias.
OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 27. â A man who
had been serving a short sentence in the
County Jail forgot tiis name to-night, but
being the only prisoner in the jail about
whom there was any doubt he was re
leased, as he had served his time.
This morning Jailer Lane went to tha
prisoner and told him his term had ex
pired. The two men went to the recep
tion-room and Lane produced the book
and compared the entry of the commit
ment with the prisoner.
"What's your name?" aÂ«ked Lane.
"I've forgotten," said the prisoner, who
had borrowed one when he found he was
under arrest. He was in earnest, and had
really forgotten his alias.
"Your name must be Steiner," said the
jailer.
"Well, I gues not"
"Steiner is the only man at liberty to go
out to-night. If youare not Steiner yon
are not liere."
"Well, I am here."
"Who arrested you?"
"A big heavy man with a black mus
tache."
"No, it was not; it was a little man,
clean-faced. If not, then you were not
arrested."
"But I was arrested."
Finally the prisoner forced himself to
beiieve that he was Steiner and that a
little man arrested him. As be passed
through the gate he said, "I guess I am
not. Steiner now, anyway."
A Student Disappears.

MB. MELVIN IS
A HANDSOME MAN
Dr. Ellis Says He Never
Criticized the Prose
cuting Attorney.
The Pastor Promises to Vote for

Happy Ending cf a Misunderstanding
Begun in a Polic- Court ani
Ended in a Church.
Oaklavd Office San Francibco Call,)
908 Broadway, Nov. 27. !
If Prosecuting Attorney Harry Melvin
be not a happy man be will never be made
happier by compliments. Rev. Dr. Ellis,
pastor of the Centennial Church, has de
clared publicly that Mr. Melvin is "a
handsome man," "a gentleman," "a good
basso," "a man well up in his profession."
PROSECUTING ATTORNEY HENRY A. MELVIN,
"Whom Rev. Dr. Ellis Now Says Is "a Handsome Man, a Gentle
man and a Good Basso."
The pastor further declares that the hand- ;
aome basso sball have his vote for any
office to which he may desire election.
All this is very kind of Dr. Ellis and is
equally gratifying to Mr. Melvin, but
things were not always thus. There was
a time, only a few short months ago, when
Dr. Eilin and Mr. Melvin did not agree as
well; in fact, they disagreed on many ma
terial points, and there is great interest
shown in the proceedings since it became
known thut the divine and the lawyer
have joined issues.
The breach between the handsome basso
and the Presbyterian preacLer arose out
of the conduct of a case in the Police
Court Mr. Melvin acted in the capacity
of public prosecutor and satisfied himself
that he had done his duty. The cause of
the defendant was espoused to a certain
degree by Dr. Eilis. The pastor, no iloubt
well-meaning, fell into the mistaKe so
often made in Oa-land of sending his
views to a newspaper in the form of a
communication. If Mr. Ellis understands
the methods of Police Court procedure
then his remarks were certainly a reflec
tion on Mr. Melvin. It is evident, how
ever, that the p.istor did not mean t lns,
for he has just said so over his own signa
ture.
The incident would have been lost to
memory had not Mr. Melvin recently de
cided to be gaiiant to a lady, even at the
expense of appearing anxious to appease
the pastor. When Mrs. Eva Wrenn, the
soloist of Dr. Ellis' church, had her bene
fit concert a few weeks ago, Mr Melvin
refused to ansisi until assured that his ef
forts would redound exclusively to the
benefit of Mrs. Wrenn. Then he knew no
alternative. The story was whispered
about and finally reached the pastor's
ears.
Rev. Dr. Ellis has published a card of
explanation. He says:
I have never written or caused to be written
or published anything aDout Mr. Melvin or
his methods of proitssional wort ehucr in i; is
favor or to his detriment. I think him a
handsome man, a gentleman, a good basso, a
man well up In Ills profession so far as he has
experience, and U lie should aHpire to any
oflicc for whicti he is qualified I will exercise
my right as mi American citizen in his be hall.
I wish to th-ink him ior assisting ray people
in the concert and extend to him.awarm wel
come to any service where I mny render some
humble part. If ever I have niiytbing to say
about him or any other man 1 will say it to
him or attach my signature.
Now there is some doubt in the mind of
the curiounasto whether tho Dcstor's ex
planation is not rather more effusive than
etiquette demands. Mr. Melvin in the
meantime is not doing any "comment
ing."

Terreaultof San Francisco. The K'room
was also accompanied by bis parents, and
all parties gave their consent to the mar
riage. The bride wore a abort dress and
looked like a schoolgirl; the groom was

BERKELEY'S NEW CAPTAIN
Haskell, Hntchinnon ami Hall Have
Keen Proposed as Kaniome's
Successor.
BERKELEY, Cal., Nov. 27.â Now that
the great football game of the season is a
matter of history the next thing that will
attract the attention of the team will be
the selection of a captain for next year.
For two seasons it was a custom to select
the captain on the evening following ihe
Thanksgiving contest, but iast year it was
postponed, and again last evening the
matter was laid over indefinitely.
The choice of Captain Ransome fol
lowed about two weeks after the game,
and it is expected that the selection of
Berkeley's next football leader will be
mnde at lpast within that time. As a mat
ter of course much interest is centered in
the election of a man for the place, and
his nomination will doubtless not be with
out much deliberation and forethought.
While the choice of captains thus far
has been satisfactory the lesson of yester
day's overwhelming defeat has taught the
Berkeley men to be conservative and
cautious in the future, even to a fault. As
candidates for tie place of captain three
men have already been named. They are
Haskell '97, Hutchinson '99 and Hall ' 99.
Though Haskell is lÂ» the aenior clas.i he
will not graduate next May, but will re
turn to serve his university. Being an
upper classman and a heady and extraor
dinary snappy player he seems to have
the advantage over the other two candi-
I dates.

| dinner speech last night at the Baldwin

vised that creat care should be exercised
in the selection of captain, and once hav

Disastrous Fire Averted.
BERKELEY, Cal., Nov. 27.â A disas-
I trous lire in the Bailey block was narrowly
averted yesterday alternoon by tne prompt
action of John Thompson, foreman of the
j \V. D. Worster Company, and the Third
I Ward hose company.
The blaze started at about 3 o'clock in
the oil storeroom of Worster & Co. No
explanation as to the origin of the lire
can be given. By fearless work on the
part of Thompson and the hose company
the flames which threatened to destroy
the entire Bailey building, the largest
l>locK in Berkeley, were extinguished.
Damage to the extent of about $500 was
sustained.

PROBING INTO A
SCHOOL SITE DEAL
The Grand Jury Asks the
Directors About the
Mission High.
Pointed Questions Asked About
the Purchase of the Guerrero
' Street Lot.
Long and Lond Talk in the Jury-
Room About Indictments and
Injunctions.
"Wonld yon as an lndividul pay $52, 500
for that property?"
The foregoing was one of the first ques
tions which the Grand Jury yesterday
afternoon propounded to Henry T. Scott,
president of the Board of Education.
Mr. Scott replied: "It I particularly
wanted t at property for building pur
poses I would pay it. Since the valuation
had been appraised by experts at $50,000 I
would give the $2500 extra to get just what
I wanted."
Grand Juror James C. Nealon was the
chief questioner. He wanted to know if
Mr. Scott had heard of the public tumult
and the newspaper roasts about the con
duct of the Board of Education in this
property-purchasing transaction.
Scott dazed the jury by asking questions
himself in rapid-tire style. He railed in
after this fashion:
"Why, you have been roasted by the
press, haven't you, Nealon? You were
Asse ssor and didn't the newspapers charge
tuat you had not assessed the Union Iron
Works at the true value? Didn't you come
down to the works and assess us?"
Then everybody in the Grand Jury room
excepting the Assistant District Attoney
Mr. Peixotlo, asked questions. Frederick
Hobbs and Harry W. Goodall were excep
tionally active.
The site nbout which so many questions
were asked in such a short space of time is
at the corner of Guerrero and Eishteenth
streets. It is owned jointly by the Jewish
Cemetery Association and the Bioch es
tate.
Mr. Lawton, the real estate man, has
been conducting negotiations on the part
j of tho Board of Education for the pur
hase of the land. It is proposed to erect
i he Mission High School on the site.
Other lots were considered. One at Fol
som and Twentieth streets obtained come
favor. A tract of land on Valencia street
was regarded as desirable, but inquiry
brought out the information that that
tract was not for sale. Tne original figure
i for the accepted site was $50,000, but before
: t c terms of transfer had been adjusted
the Mission Defense Club and another as
sociation in the region where there is no
fog let out the news that the board wanted
the Guerrero-street property.
On receipt of this news the owners
promptly advanced the price from $50,000
to $55,000. A. P. Van Dazer, who was anx
ious that the purchase should be consum
mated, begged the board to bold the ques
tion open, promising to get the price re
duced to $50,000. He got it down to $52,
-500, and sit the figure eleven of tho twelve
School Directors voted to buy.
School Directors Scott, Kuox, McElroy,
Hawley, Corute, Henderson, Murdoch,
Soper, Carew and Barrett and Secretary
George Ueauston told the Grand Jury
what they knew about tne values of real
estate and the methods of preparing plans
for new buildings.
The School Directors were asked if they
did not know thai the law required that
plans should be open to competition.
Mention was made of a communication
from Editor Culoei tson on that subject.
Directors Care w and Murdoch were so
long in the jury-room that outsiders fan
cied that the jury had found a lead. It
transpired that ihe time was taken up in
testing the knowledge of witnesses con
cerning the value of real estate in San
Francisco. Incidentally it was disclosed
that the Grand Jury has had experts fig
uring on the value of this accepted site of
land. Umbsen and Shainwald have been
asked what tne property is worth. The
former held it to be worth $50,000.
The School Directors acknowledge that
they were pinched for $2500, but fall back
on the general proposition that a board or
public body can never make as good a
bargain as an individual may bring about.
Sellers, it is said, wiil take advantage of
public necessities. According to the
story told to tbe Grand Jury the size of
this particular lot ot land is 194 by 398
feet. T; lias a depth of 220 feet in the
rear. Tbe site is an ideal one. After de
ducting the price of the land and the
architect's commission there will be left
$137,000 for the builuing from the allotted
sum of $200,000.
The Grand Jury seemed to think that
undue haste had been shown in the ac
ceptance of plans. The witnesses, on com
ing out of the jury-room, said "Undue
hasie" was the chief charge against the
board. Nealon tired that suggestion at
them several times, and wanted to know
point blank if ttiey had not been guilty of
"undue haste."
There was quite a tempest in the jury
room. Men at work on the dome of the
New City Hall paused to listen to the
speeches. The reaching qualities of Nea
lon's educated lungs weie tested. Some
of the jurors wanted indictments at first;
then they wanted an injunction. At 7
o'clock, after the jury had been in session
for five solid hours, most of the jurors
wanttd an adjournment.
The case was then put over until next
Tuesday evening. In the meantime it
will be seen what can be done. More ex*
perts will place a Valuation on the land.
The frienua of other sites will rally and
se?k to defeat the purchase. T<e transac
tion is still open, as the examination of
title is still pending. This afternoon at 5
o'clock the Board of Education will hold
a special meeting.
When the jury adjourned the foreman,
Frederick Hobbs, said nothing had been
done, lie observed that the price of the
Guerrero-street land had gone up from
$50,000 to $52,500, but fancied that the ad
vance was due to the general prosperity
following McKinley's election. A further
rise than that was not obtained from the
foreman.
The Grand Jury committee on Health
Department, almshouse, hospitals and
City Prison had a report ready for sub
mission yesterday, but tlie pressure of
School Department business excluded
consideration of the report. This com
mittee is comnosed of A. E. Drucker, Wil
liam F. Mau ana Richard Fecht. Humor
goes that the hospital management has
received the attention of the committee.
A Successful Concert.
OAKLAND, Cal., No". 27.â The concert
given by Mrs. Eva Wren in Centennial

cess and one of which Mrs. Wren may
justly be proud, as the sea tine capacity of
the pretty church was taxed to the ut
most. Miss Ethel Fleming opened the
programme by an artistic rendition of
Chopin's "Grande Valse" (op. 42). Miss
Retena Owens, the dramatic reader, is
new to the Oakland public. She has an
agreeable voice and a graceful presence,
and when experience has tausnt her to
put more soul into her lines she will be
even more enjoyable than at present.

lege was placed at the plate of. each guest.
The young men gathered in the parlors
at half-past 12, and at 1 o'clock repaired
to the dining ball, where each was
assigned a seat at the table. Covers were
spread for two hundred, and a good many
more than this partook of the hospitality of
the association during the day. The gen
eral secretary, H. J. McCoy, culled to
order, and after singing the original hymi.
grace was said by Re *. Robert S. Boyus of
Modesto.
The menu was most tempting and appe
tizing. Afterample justice bad been done
to the bountiful feast each young man
was requested to stand, give his name,
nationality or State in this country from
which he came. This caused no little
merriment, and it was ascertained that
ten nationalities and twenty-five States
were represented by the company. In the
evening a praise service was given in the
Association auditorium, in which the
Moody Institute quartet of Chicago took
a prominent part. The ladies most prom
inent on the committee 01 arrangements
were: Mrs. J. E. Cline, Mrs. H. 8. Black
well. Mrs. G. E. Tapgart. Mrs. G. A. Mul

An Armenian's Flan for Paying Off the
United States Uobt.
Treasury Agent Moore had a curious
Visitor yesterday afternoon. He claimed
to be from Armenia, was none too well
dressed and wore spectacles of the magni
fying order.
After introducing himself, giving a name
wilh a couple of dozen letters in it, he
came to the business for which he haa
called by saying: "I have a plan by which
the several-million-dollar debt of the
United States can be easily wiped out.
Several o.ays ago the letters on the signs
on the stores were suddenly changed to
Babylonian characters that I understood,
but no one else does. Now, by the knowl
edge givin to me 1 can change the water
of the Sacramento River, which belongs to
the Government, into steam b^er. The
river runs many million gallons an hour,
and this beer put in barrels would realize
a snug little sum for the United States,
would it not? Of course it would. Weil,
after we had all the steam beer that we
could sell I would change the steam into
port wine, and could bottla up millions of
bottles â enough for years to come. Good
plnn. We would scon pay off the debt in
gold â no, not a cent in silver â "
Major Moore by this time decided that
the Armenian should present his scheme
to the Treasury Department, and sent his
visitor to the sub-treasury on Commercial
street. He had not reached there at last
accounts.

terday, however, her will was stronger and
she seemed stronger in every way. Dr.

Champagne Contract in Question
The Supreme Court yesterday decided a case
against J. J. Raver, who appealed from a
judgment in the trial court in tue suit of J. J.
Raver against J. Wolf and others. The Su
preme Court affirmed the judgment in the
lower court. The matter at issue was an
alleged breach of a written contract and an
attempt to recover. The defendants in the
suit entered into an agreement with H. Brun
hild & Co. of New York City relative to the
sale of a certain brand of champagne. This
contract was dated February 5, 1891, and was
to run five years from Its date. A complaint
was filed May 20, 1895, when damages were
sought.

THE PICKING WAS
AGAIN VERY HARD
Palomacita Was the Only
Winning Favorite at
Oakland.
Don Gara Won Driving From
Jim Boz man at Odds of
50 to I.
Model, a Long-Priced Outsider, Fin
ished Second â Infiimmator Ran a
R. mark ably Gocd Race.
The talent stumbled over some more
tortuous curves and inshoots at the Oak
land track yesterday. Outsiders straggled
in ahead of the first choices and finally
to relieve the dreary monotony Don Gara
took the closing race at odds of 50 to 1. Oi
the favorites Falomacita was the only suc
cessful one.
The weather was cold and the attend
ance lighter than usual. The majority
of bettors left for home with most of their
surplus cash resting easily in the book
makers' strontr boxes.
Tnirteen maiden two years furnished
the first opportunity for speculating. The
distance was five furlongs, and Kapido
was a slight favorite in the betting over
Ben Benjamin's black gelding Yaldos.
Iron Jacket made the running to the
stretcb, where Etta H took the lead and
at the end won all out, three parts of
a length before Yaldos.
Receding in the betting from evens to
13 to 10 the' Burns and Waterhouse entry
Falomacita cut out all tne running in the
mile dash that followed, and won easily
' :rom the 100 to 1 shot Model. Meadow
Lark was a good third.
Green Morris' colt Inflammator made a
remarkably good run in the mile for two
year-ulds and showed himself to be of the
improving sort. Alma was first in de
mand in the betting at evens, with 5 to 1
offered against the Biutus colt. Of the
others Bernardillo and Principle were
we.l supported. When the barnei shot in
the air luflainmator wheeled and came
very near being leit at the post, losing
fully lour lengths. Closing up the lost
ground the first quarter he waned on
Alma until well inio the stretch, where he
gradually crew ahead and won at the wire
a neck irom the last-coining Bernardillo.
The lavonte was third.
All with lignt welter-weights up, Belli
coso starting at odLis of Ito 2 easily dis
posed of his company in the bix-furlong
sprint, with Flashlight finishing in the
place, six lengths before Montaivo.
Nearly every one of the eleven starters
in the concluding race of tne day, a rive
and a half furlong scramble, decidea
under seihn:; conditions, received more or
less suppor . They were a mediocre lo ,
and Veragua Â« as played down to 11 10 5
favoritism. Jim Bozeman ana Don Gara
> had the race to themselves. The former
had the footing over vis competitor until
well on toward the wire, when Don Gara
assumed the front position, and in a uard
drive eained the decision by a nead. The
winner was backed from 50 ilown to 25 to 1
by an intermittent sort of play. Eucino,
well played at 4 to 1, was a fairish third.
Notes.
The Stewards of the California Jockey
Club have decided that Tom Boyle, who
bid Moylan up after winning a selling
race on November 18, is not entitled to
half of the run-up money, as Major Cook,
who rimshed second, is owned by B. C.
Holly and not by Boyie, in whose name
he ran. The fact was developed that Holly
leased the horse to Boyle, but the lease
was not recorded with the clerk of the
course. Under rule 21 Major Cook is de
prived of any portion of the purse as well,
and Palomacita gets the run-up and sec
ond money ana Edgeniount, the four.h
horse at the finish, falls heir to third
money.
T. W. Coulter, the owner of Redskin
and other horses, arrived from the East
Thursday night.
Trainer Pleasant of the Baldwin string
was questioned in regard to the showing
ma c by the horses in his charge. It
looks as though one racp had a remarkably
invigorating effect on their running
powers, but as ihe trainer claimed the
stable did not benefit thereby nothing
came of the matter. It is a fact neverthe
less that people connected with the stable

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 28, 1896.
SCHOOLS WILL
REMAIN CLOSED
Lively Session of the Board
of Health on the
Subject.
Dr. Clinton of the Board of Ed
ucation Denies That There
Is an Epidemic.
Father Brennan of St. Francis Paro
chial School Alsc Files a Vain
Protest Against Closing.
The three public schools closed by the
Board of Healthâ the Marshall Primary,
the Mission Grammar and the Everett
Grammar â will remain closed until the
Board of Education shall have equipped
them with sanitary plumbing. The St.
Francis Parochial School will also be kept
closed until proper plumbing is put in.
This was determined upon at the meeting
of the Board of Health held yesterday
morning and in spite of the protest of the
committee of the Board of Education
which met them. The meeting was quite
a Btormy one. Dr. Clinton, chairman of
the Board of Education committee,
charged the Board of Health with being
hasty, and flatly denied that there was an
epidemic of diphtheria in the City.
Health Officer Lovelace, Dr. H. H. Hart
and Dr. Williamson declared that there
was an epidemic and that to assemble the
children in these schools was to endanger
their lives. Dr. Hart aaid further that
this mk'ht be only a beeinninir, and that
other schools would be closed if the dis
ease showed any signs of spreading fur
ther.
At the opening of the session Dr. Clin
ton called for a bill of particulars, speci
fying wherein the schoois that have been
closed are at fault in a sanitary way.
Dr. Lovel ice said that a year ago the
Board 01 Health had condemned all open
vaults in the iniclic schools. Tne Board
of Education had said that these would be
corrected during the long vacation, and
that the planking, which had also been
coi.domned in many of the schools, would
be replaced wiih new. The summer vaca
tion had passed, and very little improve
ment had been effected in any of the
schools. In the Hawthorne Scnool some
repairs were being made now, but the
open vault is allowed to remain. A num
ber 01 cases of dinhtheria have been di
rectly traced to these schools, and the
Board of Health had thought best to close
them.
Mayor Sutro asked Dr. Clinton if the
Board of Education had the money where
with to make the changes in the plumb
ing arrangements required by the Board
of Health.
Dr. Clinton answered: "No, sir. If you
insist upon putting In new plumbing it
will close all these schools indefinitely. I
may say that I am as anxious as voii are
to have proper plumbing in the schools,
but it is simply impossible lor tne board
to put it in as t ey have not the means.
The blame for this state of things belongs
o the Board of Supervisors, and it should
be p l od tnÂ»Â»re. The Board of Education
submit. cd a statement of the iund* re
quired for puttiEg the schools in proper
sa.itary condition and for operating
them, but the money wa* not allowed.
Our board has not been extravagant, but
has exercised due economy, but it rinds it
self now in a position where it will have
to withhold the saarits of the teachers.
Therefore it is absurd 10 ask us to ni:ike
repairs that will cost $4000 or $.5000 for
each fcbool. I may say that as a member
of the Buard of Supervisors-elect I abal
see to it that the schools are allowed
money enough next year to conduct them
properly."
Dr. Hart stated that seventy-five cases
oi diphtheria had been reported from tne
immediate vicinity of the school*, and
that while the repairs are beins: made the
removing of the decayed planks and the
stirring of the surface of the ground
disease germs would be likely to spread
the contagion. He said there was an
urgent necessity lund which might be
drawn upon for the purpose and that the
work could be done in less than two
weeks. He insisted upon adhering to the
original resolution. He said that other
people's children were as dear to their
parents as his own were to him, and he
certainly would not allow his children to
attend school under the circumstances.
Mayor Sutro remarked tnat it would be
a great hardship upon the children to
close the schools for such a length of ime
"Is it a greater hardship to keep them
from school or to cause their death?"
asked Dr. Hart.
The Mayor thought that by a proper
course of disinfection the whole trouble
could be overcome.
Dr. Soper of the committee of the Board
of Education declared that he had visited
all the schools complained of, and that ne
had seen nothing to cause alarm. The
schools, he said, were in a reasonably
sanitary condition.
Dr. Williamson said that he desired to
go on reÂ« ord in favor of radical measures
The Board of Education had been warned'
a year auo and it had not taken the warn
ing. Now t c Board of Healtb was con
fronted with an emergency, and must
meet it. He be leved the responsibility
lay with the Board of Supervisors, and he
thought that this action would place it
there.
Dr. Clinton declared that he was willing
to Btake his reputation as a physician on
the statement that t c replanking, which
cou.d be accomplished by Monday, and
the liberal use of water in the vaults
which also could be effected in a lew days,'
would pat the schools in as good con
dition as need be for the occasion. He
declared also that it was not true that an
epidemic of diphtheria prevailed in any
part of the City; that he could not 6ee
how any reputable physician could say
there was in view of the facts, and he
thought it very unwise ihat the people,
and especially the parents of school
children, should be alarmed in this*
manner.
Dr. Lovelace declared that there was an
epidemic, and that the closing of the
schools was deemed wise as a precaution
ary measure in keeping the children apart.
Rev. Father Brennan, in charge of St.
Francis parochial school, was present, and
made a strong protest against the closing
of that institution, which the board had
also ordered.
The board decided, however, to stand by
its original resolution ordering these four
schools closed, and to remain closed until
the proper sanitary plumbing had been
pnt in.
A resolution was also passed providing
that disinfectants be used liberally in all
the schools.
A meeting of the Board of Education
has been called for this evening at 5 o'clock
to take what action may be deemed advis
able.
Two cases of diphtheria were reported
to the secretary ot the health board yes
terdayâboth from the Mission.
CHASED BY A BULL.
Revenue Officer T. W. I'hinn Has a
Narrow Escape Near Haywards.
Thomas W. Chirm. bookkeeper in the
Internal Revenue office, had an experi
ence on Thanksgiving day that he will not
soon forget. He was visiting his tather
in-iaw, who has a cattle ranch near Hay
waras, in Alameda County. Mr. Cbinn
and his relative went out into the fields to
inspect the cattle and in some way be
came separated. After walking for a con
siderable <iistance Mr. Chirm came across
ahi-rd headed by a larce red bull.
The latter's curiosity was excited by the
appearance of the revenue officer, and he
a vanced upon the intruder. Mr. Chirm
did not like the appearance of the ani
mal's manners and he started to beat a
retreat. Tne bull advanced rapidly and
â¢Mr. Chirm increased bis pace until it was
a race across the fkld. The pursued is a
very short stout man and the pursuer
took advantage of the man's inability to
make 2:40 time by keeping his short,
snsrp horns close to Mr. Chirm's coat
tails. Mr. Chirm's only hope â a sad hope
at bestâ was a barbed-wire fence that
loomed up in the distance. At last he
reached it. To slide under was impossi
?? !t was a hog- tig lit fence. To leap
was Mr. Chirm's only chance and he took
it witb a flying leap.
Tne major part of the man cleared the
cruel wires, but not all. Yester lay the
clerks in the revenue office commented
upon the fact that th 9 bookkeeper was
wearing a brand new pair of trousers and
stood up to his workâ to keep from spoil
ing the creases, he explained.'

TWO DYED HORSES
FOR MRS. HUNTER
A Trickster in Horseflesh
Neatly Caugh by a
Sharp Woman.
. Captain Thomson of the Park
Police Found the Man
With the Horses.
The Widow of the Late David Hunter
Cannot Be Fooled by a Coat cf
Dye on a White Surface.
The trickster in horseflesh who may
have inferior animals to dispose of would
better not try to make a deal with Mrs.
J-oan N. G. Hunter, the widow of the late
David Hunter. Such an experiment
was tried upon this lady a few weeks ago,
but with poor results to the man who
made the a' tempt.
Mrs. Hunter is a woman of education
. and refinement and thoroughly posted on
the ways of the world. Being a lady of
vast wealth, witn a refined taste for every
thing that is elegant, she is a lover of
thoroughbred horses, and in her desire to
acquire some of the best stock to be found
on this coast for her private use she, in
her drives through the Golden Gate Park,
became acquainted with Captain Thom
son, to whom she expressed her wish to
possess a pair of coal black horses for
her stable.
Such a desire from a lady of Mrs. Hun
ter's social position to Mr. Thomson was
sufficient to stimulate him to act
promptly, and it was understood that if
the coal-black team yon d be found
within the limits of the City or even of
Oakland they would be lorthconiing. And
they were. For inside of one week from
the time the lady expressed her wishes
the brave captain of police and guardian
of ladies in the Golden Gate Park had a
spanking team of jet-black horses stand
ing in iront of 903 Van Ness avenue, the
residence of the rich widow.
A hn-ty inspection of the animals by
Ihe lady with the suggestion that she
would like to see them driven was as a
matter of course complied with by the
captain and by the attendant who hau
charge of the horses.
Having procured her soft wraps and
buggy robes Mrs. Hunter took her seat in
the buggy, whiie Captain Thomson and
the driver occupied the forward seat on
the box. The round of the park was taken
and the homeward spin finished with the
greatest satisfaction apparently to all con
cerned. The corses traveled well and
made a fine appearance as they came
down Golden Gate avenue "'hard held,"
as the racecourse habitues express it, and
with a grand round-up in Iront of the
elegant residence of the millionaire
widow. The driver and Captain Tiiom
son alighted from their seats with the
agility of En lish footmen, and a second
examination of the iet-black steeds was
had, with which the driver and the officer
were well satisfiud.
Not so. however, Mrs. Hunter. She ex
â pressed a desire to see some more of the
horse* before drawing her check for $1000.
She instructed the man who nad cuar^e of
the horses to take them to the stable in
the rear ot the premises and unbarness
them, as she preferred to have another
look at them.
The driver complied and the horses were
taken to the sable and the harness re
moved, when the piercing eye of the prac
tical lady was thrown over the forms ol
the Horses with that exact scrutiny simi
lar to the penetrating vision of the'X ray.
After a careful examination of the sup
posed" $1000 beauties which were to adorn
the staDles of the Van Ness avenue mil
lionaire, Mrs. Hunter discovered a shady
look about the forehead and another abou*
the hind legs of one of the "je;-black"
horses. She instructed her groom to bring
a damp sponge iorward and try its '-fleet
on the places pointed oat to him. He did
as directed- with the result that the damp
sponge removed a coat of black dye on the
forehead and hind legs of one of the
horses.
This satisfied the lady that she was
about to be imposed upon, and in order to
see bow far this impo.-itiun was intended
she dispatched a messenger for a veteri
nary surgeon, who, on his arrival and
after a careful examination of the horses,
declared that they were a pair of spavined,
bunged-up old hacks, dyed and doctored
for the occasion.
Since this episode Mrs. Hunter has not
been trouble 1 with callers desirous oi sail
ing a set of blhck or milk-white horses for
her private use.
.But all horse-dealing fakers have come
to the conclusion that there is one lady in
this City who cannot be imposed upon
and who is smart enough to protect her
self against the tricks of sharpers and
frauds.
Captain Thomson is especially fond of
black Horses, and acted in perfect good
iaith in the matter. He will doubtless be
very indignant when he learn., of the de
ception which was praciiced upon him.
VICTORY FOR A RAILWAY.
Beheaxing Or fered by the Supreme
Court, Three' Justices Dissenting.
In a dissenting opinion yesterJay Jus
tice lemple of the Supreme Court, Jus
tices Hensbaw and Beatty concurring,
condemned the reckless running of
electric cars. The gut was that of
Amanda P. Everett and Marchia A.
Everett, by her guardian, against the Los
Angeles Consolidated Electric Railway
Company. A car on the railway in ques
tion struck Charh-s E. Everett as he was
riding a bicycle on McClintock avenue in
Los Angeles. The test mony was that the
motorman of ihe car rang his bell as he
drew near Everett, but that he gave no
sign that he Heard the beil.
Everett died and the heirs secured a
judgment against the railway company,

HEYNEMAN ASSAULTED.
He Wai Struck Repeatedly by F. Cook
Caldwell In Judge Sanderao&'s
Courtroom YÂ«Â«terday.
Attorney A. Heyneman is having con
siderable trouble in regard to the suit of
Zaliskv against Newman. Zalisky claims
$50,000 damages for the alienation of his
wife's affections.
Mr. Heyneman is Newman's legal rep
resentative, and Hst Wednesday in Judge
Sanderson's court made a remark to the
effect that the suit is a case of blackmail.
This aspersion was instantly resented
by Reel Terry, one of ZaHsky's attorneys.
He struck at Mr. Heyneman, but misled,
and the trouble was stopped by the bailiff.
Yesterday was the time for resuming
the taking of depositions, and Attorney F.
Cook Caldwell went to Judge Sanderson's
courtroom to participate in the examina
tion, being associated with Mr. Terry as
counsel for Zalisky.
Before court was called to order Mr.
Caldwell and Mr. Heyneman engaged in
a dispute, and Mr. Caldwell struck Mr.
Heyneman in the face several times,
causing his nose to bleed freely. Mr. Hey
neman quickly left the courtroom and the
case watt continued to Monday.
Mr. Caldwell explained by saying that
Mr. Heyneman had called him a liar aud
a coward.
Mr. H^yneinan's version of the affair
is as follows: I
SUPERVISOR-ELECT ROTTANZL
Before Shaving. After Shaving.
Tde deposition was postponed until this
morning at 10 o'clock. I was on time at that
hour and was sitting in a Urge arm chair on
the platform of Judge Sanderson's courtroom,
reading a newspaper.
Suddenly Attorney Caldwell stepped in
front of me and said: "Did yon mean that
statement you made in oourt oh Monday?" I
told him 1 most assuredly {lid, and that any
statement 1 made in a courtroom I was respon
sible for.
Without a word of warning ana while I
was sitting with my hands engaged he struck
me ln the face, and be f ure I could even protect
myself he struck me again.
1 told him I considered it a most cowardly
and brutal assault aud that none but a des
perado would attack a man in the position 1
was in. He then attempted to strike me agai n,
but misled. He is an immense man, weighing
about 240 Bounds, while 1 am very small in
comparison.
After giving his version of the fracas
Mr. Heyneman dilated upon the case to
the extent of explaining why he consid
ered himself warranted from the evidence
in declaring the case in question to be one
oi b ackmail.
He said he had gone privately to Attor
ney Reel B. Terry's office and told him it
was simply an instance of blackmail and
that he (Terry) would soon be sorry that
he had ever permitted his name to be con
nected with it.
No arrests have been made, but it is un
derstood that Chief Crowley has promised
to send ten policemen armed to the teeth
into Judge Sanderson's courtroom next
Monday to assist in keeping ti>e peace.
A SCHOOL BOARD CAUCUS
Committees Selected Last Night
by the Board of Educa
tion.
Charles L. Barrington Elected Presi
dent of the Board and a Health
Commit'ee Mooted.
The new Board of Education held a
prolonged caucus at Dr. Drucker's office
last night, which resulted in tne selec
tion of a president ana of a chairman for
each of the committees of the board.
The following were agreed upon: Presi
dent of the board, Chariea L. Barnn ton;
Finance Committee, Samuel L Waller;
Classification, W. A. Derhara ; Ruies, Dr.
Georue I. D ucker; Salaries, Edward L.
Head; Qualifications, Benjamin Armer;
Buildinps and Grounds, Tuomas Burns;
Supp.ies, C. A. Bantei; Ju liciary, J. L.
Halstedt; Printing, Edward Gallagher;
Visiting, Thomas R. Carew; Janitors, Ed
ward Gallagher.
After considerable discussion it was de
cided that it would be a jood idea to es
tablish a Health Committee, the subject
receiving particular consideration because
of t c present epidemic of diphtheria. It
was agreed that if the committee shall be
established Samuel L. Waller wiil be se
lected as chairman. The caucus was quite
harmonious throughout. Tne chairman
will appoint ttie other committeemen be
fore the first of the year.
PIQUED HIS CURIOSITY.
lhat Is Why Mr. Archibald Will
Probably Ascend a Mountain
by Balloon.
James F. J. Archibald has arrived from
the East. He confirmed the news yester
day that he proposes to go to New Mexico
to view and explore a mountain upon the
crest of which 500 Nav&jo Indians were,
according to Jeeend, starved to death
many years ago. This mountain is well
known to all travelers over the Santa Fe
Railroad and is customarily pointed out
to person? passing for the first time over
the line by Pullman porlers and "peanut
butchers."
Two stories are given to account for the
starving to death of the Indians at that
point. One is that they were besieged by
hostiies, who drove them up there and
kept them from corame down. The other
story is that a landslide broke away the
mountain precipitously, and the Indian
could not get down. The last-named story
wan telegraphed from Chicago to make it
fit in with a story that Mr. Archibald
would reach the summit by the use of a
balloon.
Mr. Archibald says that he will go to
the summit merely for the adventure of it,
the place having piqued his curiosity. He
will possibly use a balloon, for that seems
the easiest way for him to get up. He will
start next week.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 28, 1896.
DR, ROTTANZI'S
BEARD IS GONE
Bold Stand Taken by the
Supervisor- Elect of
the Seventh.
Bent Upon Relorm, the Good
Doctor Assumes a Stern
Countenance.
Puzzling, Perplexing Incidents Follow
the Loss of the Silky
Vandyke.
Strange, fantastic dreams haunted the
busy brain of Dr. T. A. Rottanzi, the genial
Supervisor-elect of the Seventh Ward,
Wednesday night. Samson, in the days of
his most cruel bondage to the Philistines,
never suffered such anguish as did the
good druggist - doctor- Democrat on
Thanksgiving eve, and the City Dad-elect
of the Seventh dreamed that he, 1 ke Sam
son, had been beguiled to part with his
hirsute appendages of head and face by a
cooing Delliah, who afterward betrayed
him into the bands of the enemy.
Then a change came over the spirit of
his dreams. Greet Scott! He dreamed
he was Harvey Scott, editor of the Port
land Oregonian, whose facile pen was re
cently dipped in slush mixed with gall
and shaken over the fair name and fame
of California.
"By the statue of Twin Peaks!" shrieked
the good doctor as he tossed restlessly
about, "I'm neither Samson nor Harvey
Scott. What mean these strange hal
lucinations?"
With a mighty effort he rose in bed and
instinctively bis right hand went to his
head and drifted down to hia face. Alas!
it was only too true. Slowly the dawn of
memory entered his puzzled brain and he
recalled that the day" before he had per
mitted his tonsorial artist to remove lhat
beautiful Vandyke beard so familiar to
constituents in the Seventh Ward and
urchins who made collections of ejection
cards.
With many a heart-burning the suc
cesi.su! candidate viewed his boyish face
in the mirror as be adjusted his cardinal
necstie and mused o'er the past. How
many weary, dreary months, even years,
had be watched the growth of that
beautiful beard. Bat there was balm in
the consolation that when duty called he
would not falter. Had not the citizens of
the Seventh chosen 1 im as their cham
pion? Had they not expressed a desire
for reform in every department of the
city government? Was it not his duty to
begin this reform in his own personal ap
pearance? Nevgr mind what the Popu
lists might say ; be would risk their right
eons anger.
With these good resolutions the re
former of the Seventh completed bis
morning toilet and sauntered forth to give
thanks in any way that mieht aeem good
to him. He had not reckoned, however,
on the surprise of his friends. At his
drugstore hia cl^rk eyed him coldly when
he issued the usual mornirg instructions,
and the doctor was compelled to produce
a card in his attempt to identify himself
as the proprietor <>f the establishment.
A few minutes later he accosted a group
of friends with "Hello, boys!" They
looked at him suspiciously and one asked,
"Who is the impudent fellow?" â¢ Again
the Supervisor-elect was compelled to
establish his identity.
"And why, doctor, have you decided to
masquerade on Thanksgiving day ?" asked
one of the friends after the doctor had
"fixed" it with the assemblage at the bar.
"Indeed," replied the reformer, "it is
not a masquerade at ail. It is done in the
interest of reform. It's a long story, but
I'll shorten it. You must all remrmber
that I based my canvass for Supervisor of
tue Seventh ward principally npon the
promise of reforming the many md glar
ing evils of this great City and â "
"Well," interrupted one of the friends,
"and what baa reform to do with the loss
of your beard?' 1
"A great deal, indeed," resumed the
druggist-doctor. "Who ever heard of a
man entering upon such a Herculean task
without first making his countenance as
stern as bis purpose. My felluw-citize.ns,
when I realize the terrible responsibility
resting â "
"Let's have another," said one of the as
semblage, and the remainder of the doc
tor's peroration was drowned by the
clinking of glasses.
And so it went throughout the day.
Over and over again the good Supervisor
elect was compelled to establish his iden
tity and explain the purposes of his dar
ing transformation.
Finally the story reached the press and
some of the reporters suggested that the
doctor was ambitious to become a journal
ist. S<>me of the old-timers remembered
how fond the doctor was of the newspaper
business and how he bad masqueraded as
a reporter at the entrance of masquerade
balls.
Be all these stories as they may, the
bard fact remains that the doctor is beard
less, and rumor has it t at the reformer is
in danger of a Popocrat boycott.

fore the Superior Court on a charge of burg
lary, bis bail being set in the sum of $2000.

ure in the Fir* Department, finishing his
career as Fire Marshal with honor* and
retiring on a handsome pension ten years
ago.
One of the most notable episodes in Mr.
Durkee's career was hia arrest and trial for
piracy in 1856. the event growing out of
the active part he took with the vigilantes
in the memorable days when rudetnoueh
speedy methods were taken to terrify and
exterminate evil-doers.
This .rave charge was made against the
veteran who now lie 3 ill, because he was
the most dauntless and sturdy of a mem
orable band of men that seized a quantity
of arms and ammunition from a >ctiooner
in the bay early in 1856 The munitions
of war were on the way from Benicia to
San Francisco, whereupon the eager men
bent on stampinc out crime sent some of
their chosen warriors to the front to con
summate the bold scheme which the au
thorities afterward called piracy.
In September, 1556, Durkee was ac
quitted on the ground that the seizure of
weapons on a schooner in the bay near
San Leandro was not a seizure of any thin c
upon the high sea-", that part of tne bay
being a mere interior inlet. Tiiere was
great excitement in San Francisco at the
time.
In 1859 Mr. Durkee, who had won much
reputa ion for bravery and strategy, was
well know as a tearless policeman. The
duties of the* office did not please him
very well, however, f r he longed for some
peaceful pursuits. In 1862 he was for a
time Deputy Superintendent of Streets,
but by 1865 he had become fare marshal at
a salary ol $2400 a year. He continued in
this office with marked success until
October 15, ISB6, at which time he was re
tired on a liandÂ«ome pension by the Board
of Fire Underwriters. La:er the pension
was made $100 a month for life.
In addition to his other qualifications,
Mr. Durfcee has often distinguished him
self bs a writer of clever abilities. On July
17. 1888, he wrote an interesting article on
'The Bells of the Monumental Engine
Company of Baltimore," the city where

CAPTAIN RICHARDSON' S DENIAL
He Did Not See Fhz<immnns Box, Nor
Did He Box, Nor Would He Box.
The British ship Pendragon Castle is at
present tied up in Oakland Creek. She
came here from Newcastle, N. 8. W., with
3554 tons of coal, and In a few days will
load wheat for Sydney. The rate is 19
shillings a ton, but even at that figure the
vessel will make more money than a
charter at a little advance for a voyage to
Liverpool would bring.
Inadvertently Caotain Richardson's
name was mentioned as one of several
who visited Fitzsimmons a couple of days
ago.
The Pendragon Castle has not been in
Richardsons Bay this year, and while
Captain Richardson may have been on a
visit to some of his brother captains whose
vessels are tied up at Sausalito, still he
was not present when Fitzsimmons put on
the cloves and "boxed for fun." Captain
Rrchardson says most emphatically that
he never uses boxing-gloves and that he is
not "so easily frightened."
