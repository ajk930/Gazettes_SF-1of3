ATHENS, Ohio, Sept 20.â General
Grosvenor to-nigut gave out a table of es
timates of the probable result of the
Presidential election at the request of cer
tain members of tbe press in the East.
He said :
I have baen urged for several weeks to au
thorize the publication of a table of estimates
of the Presidential election and I have hesi
tated to do so because there was more or leas
uncertainty in regard to the result. Not that
tne re has ever been any uncertainty or doubt
in tbe Intelligent mind as to who would be
elected, but following the St Louis conven
tion and the nomination of Bryan and Sewall
by one faction of the Democratic party and
tbe substantial absorption of the Populist
party which succeeded that event there was
some uncertainty as to how a number of the
States would finally go, and this condition of
uncertainty has not yet entirely disappeared,
but the general drift of political events has
reached a point where I think I need not hesi
tate to point out substantially how the several
Stale.- will go.
The six New England States, with thirty-nine
electoral votes, will go to McKiniey, so I head
my table as follows: ~ : Vl.,
New England ..; 89 (Wisconsin... â If
Newborn SB I.wÂ« .. ............ IS
New Jersey ...'...'.... ' ,0 Minnesota ...... 9
Maryland 8 South Dakota ." i

Michigan.... ........ 14| ~.~".
Here is a total of 278 votes, or 54 more than
sufficient to elect, all of which are practically
sure lor McKiniey. 1 come to some States
which are still in doubt, but which, under the
high tide of Republican success now sweeping
over the country, will be almost sure to vote
for McKinieyâ if not all of them, at least a
very large proportion of them, to wit: .
Kansas.:... :..... .10 Wy0ming......... 3
Nebraska 8 . . "
Norm Carolina .lj 'T0ta1.............' 35
North Bale ota 3 :
Here are thirty-five electoral votes, from
which McKmley will surely receive enough to
make good any accident that may befall the
total of 278. Of the remaining States:
.Louisiana. 8 Virginia 12
T- n ; -tee 12
Missouri > 17 Total 64
Texas 16
Are one or more of them within the line of
possibility, I might almost say reasonable
probability? I concede to Bryan and Watson,
or Bryan and Sew<ill, or Bryan and whoever it
may be at the right time:
Alabama. VI. ..'.ll ! Mississippi. 9
vy^nnKas.. . 8 : Montana 3
Murado 4! Nevada . 8
Florida 4 mi v Carolina 9
Georgia.'.:...:.; IS Utah .' a
Idftbu 3
These are practically sure for tbe opposition,
althouch there may be a possible dispute even
along that line.
I put my estimate upon the facts within my
own per.-onal knowledge of the rapid and
mighty change in public sentiment that has
been going on ever since the actual campaign
of 1896 began. I belieTe that the vote of
Arkansas, to which our oppouentÃ are point
ing with pride, is more significant of comine
results in the Middle and Western States than
is even the magnificent victory in Maine. The
fact that a State like Arkansas, with the enar
acter of whose elections we have Decome bo
familiar, exhibited such a splendid increase of
Republican votes and such a significant de
crease of Democratic votes is in the highest
degree important, and a relative increase of
Republican votes in the other State* in the
Middle and West would give practically n
BoHd vote. No sensible man can snut his eyes
to the fact that tbe KcKinley tide has been
rising since about the Ist of August, and that
the ratio of its increasing power grows greater
every day.
The entire campaign is suggestive of 1872,
when In July and August there was a grave
apprehension that Oreeley might be elected.
Y*t in November he was overwhelmingly and
disastrous. y defeated.
I may add in this connection that estimate*
and prophetic utterance* of our opponents
may be well illustrated by the situation in
Ohio. During my recent trip to the Ehsi I
found scores of Republicans who were
anxiously inquiring If Ohio would be cp.rried
by McKiniey, and scores of Democrats who
Insisted thnt their information left no possibil
ity of doubt of McKlnley's defeat in his native
State. I even saw attributed io Chairman Jones
of Arkansas ihe suggestion that Ohio was confi
dently relied U).on as a Bryan State. Since my
return I have advices from every Congres
sional district in tbe State, and I predict with
confidence that lam willing to maintain at
any hazard thai McKiniey will have more than
100,000 majority in Ohio, and that he will
carry as Muuqr Congressional dtsuicts as we
did in 1894, and in no event will we lose more
than one district.
OF THE BRYANITES.
l/oubt/ul f>falet Claimed by the Silver
Democracy Manager:
CHICAGO, 1n.., Sept. 20.â 8 peaking of
tbe l>emocra!io-Fopuiist organization in
the West and Sontli and the present out
look for Bryan getting enough electoral |
voted to win, J. G. Johnson of Kansas, a
member of the National Compaign Com
mittee at Western Democratic headquart
ers, said to-day to a reporter for the United
Associated Presses:
"When Senator Jones and his associates
began the headquarters work of this cam
paign a line was drawn around a certain
number of States which could be depended
nj.on to cast their electoral voles for Mr.
Bryan; Then a few more States which
we could not be sure of were ad'ied. mak
ing the tota! vote more than enough to
elect our man. In this latter class of
The San Francisco Call
States the silver sentiment tins been
hardening steadily, and the results of our
organization work to date give no indica
tion that McKiuley can carry any of the
States we are concentrating our work
upon. I would not like to name these
States, because it would Jeave the impres
sion in some minds that we had cast off
certain States not included, and which are
not lost to Mr. Bryan by any means.
"It is only necessary foi us to carry two
big Western States, such as Minnesota,
Indiana, lowa or Illinois, to turn the elec
toral vote to Mr. Bryan. For my State,
old and experienced politicians in touch
with the work and sentiment in every
township say that if Bryan carries Kansas
it will not be by less than 20,000 majority,
i see Missouri is claimed by the Republi
cans We learn the gold Democrats are
going to vote for Palmer and the Popu
lists are united in support of our ticket.
Then Mr. Kerens comes to the Republican
headquarters and tells Mr. Hanna the
State is crone. That is a fair illustration
of bow things have been going with us
since we came here. Notwithstanding
what General Grosvenor says, we stand
as good a chance of carrying Ohio or Illi
nois. Captain McCon vilie of oar speakers
department tells me that by October 15 we
will have the enemy in as close a corner as
they ever were in their lives, and he knows
something about the State.
"In Michigan there is the strongest com
bination possible working for Mr. Bryan's
success. The party is thoroughly united
and we have the benefit of Republican
defections, which amount to thousands.
Only twice in the last sixteen years have
the Republicans at their best had 50 per
cent of the total vo.e of Michigan, and
within the last twenty days it has become
practically certain a Bryan State. In Illi
nois the reliable party workers in every
section outside of Cook County have com
piled their estimates and . say that Mr.
Bryan will come to t.e Despiaines River
with 40,000 majority. The vote in Cook
County, which is two-filths of the total
Illinois vote, is an uncertain quantity, but
the conditions are favor able to Mr. Bryan
getting? a large majority of the votes. He
has the support of | the regular Democratic
party, which is splendidly oreanized by
precincts. He has the support of the Pop
ulist party and the support cf organized
labor in the county. There are known to
be. here twice 'as many Republicans who
will vote for Bryan as there are Demo
crats who will , vote against , him. The
army of idle men at present in this county
cannot .reasonably oe expected to vote in
November for a continuance of those con
ditions which have thrown them and sept
them out of employment.
"The Republicans have to win nearly
every trick that is in the tram ana we
don't. It is not extravagant to say that
Mr. Bryan will carry every Btate south of
the Ohio and Potomac and west of the,
Mississippi. That being true, any two
I States out of the' States north of the Ohio
River and east of the Mississippi will
elect him. Only in two -States,. South
Dakota and Oregon, are there Bryan and
Watson ; electoral* tickets, and 1 , they were
given under an agreement with the Demo
crats. There is no more danger of Bryan
losing Texas than there -isâ > of his losing
Arkansas. Any man who thinks to the
contrary must be afflicted with McKiniey
insanity. The Southern men I have talked
with simply laugh at the idea of McKin
iey carrying Louisiana." .'<

A BATTLE WITH WINCHESTERS
An Early Morn in* Skirmish Between
Strikers and Guards at the
Coronado Works.
LEADVILLE, Colo., Bept. 21.â Shortly
alter midnight several heavy explosions
occurred at the Coronado mine. The ex
plosions were followed by many rifle shots
from the vicinity of tbe barricade surround
ing tbe mine, which are thought to have
been fired by an attacking force to cover
the retreat of the dynamiters in an attack
upon the works.
The shooting lasted about 10 minutes,
and has since been followed by desultory
firing.
A telephone message received from the
mine after the first explosions stated that
nobody inside the barricade had been
hurt. After receiving this message com
munication with the mine was interrupted
and has not yet been restored.
Another explosion, presumably of dy
namite, was heard after the break in the
telephone connection, which was followed
bp a bright blaze in ihe vicinity of the
mine.
The Fire Department and the loral mi
litia were hastily called out and hurritdto
tbe assistance of the besieged miners.
They found the works at the mine in a
blaze and when they attempted to turn on
the water to right the flames they were
ordered to desist by the attacking party.
Finaily they succeeded in getting connec
tion with other hydrants and turning, a
stream on the flames. Hardly had this
occurred when a series of explosions were
heard in the traction of the Emraett and
Marion mines, and it is suppose! that an
attack had been made on those working.
A later report from the Coronado mine
states that Fireman O'Keefe was fatally
shot while attempting to turn on the
water and that two unknown men are
dead.
The entire city is astir and thousands
are gathered near the Coronado works.
The Fire Department is now fighting the
names with fair prospects of success.

ALBANY, N. V., Sept. 20.â Mayor John
Boyd Tbacher to-night gare out the fol
lowing statement:
ALBAWT, N. V., Bept. 19. 1896.
Hon. El'iott Danforth, Chairman of the State
Democratic < ommittce. yew York Cityâ Dear sir:
I am iniormed by the public press and by In
dividual delegates that the Democratic party
of tbe State, in convention assembled at
Buffalo on September 17, 1896, did me the
honor of naming me as its candidate for the
high office of Governor. I now learn that the
Slate â¢ ommittee is to meet on Tuesday for the
purpose of appointing a committee to officially
notify me of that fact. It has seemed to me
due to your committee that Defore it takes
that step I should make a statement.
I cannot ask for the confidence and support
of the people of the State without frankly de
claring my position upon the financial issue
now agitating the puDlic. I stand to-day
where I stood in the month of June in the
presence of a convention of tne State Democ
racy. I have not changed an iota in my belief,
nor deviated a step in my course. Tbe com
mercial honor of this Nation is pledged to the
world, and the whole wor.d knows that the
Nation will maintain its honor.
I took part in the Btate convention which
sent delegates to represent the party in the
National Convention at Chicago. Those dele
gates by participation acquiesced in the action
of the National Convention in presenting can
didates for the offices of President and Vice-
Presidentof tbe United 3tates. The State Con
vention of the Democratic party has ratified
the nomination of UMm candidates. I have
learned from the fathers and in turn have en
deavored t<> teach that the Democratic party
is a vehicle to carry the will of tbe people into
effect. Such a vehicle is constructed with dif
ficulty, but is easily destroyed. Fail are now
and then to perform absolutely RatUfactory
service will not justify the utter destruction of
the vehicle. It was not constructed to bear
one bnrden, bnt many and various burdens.
When the financial burden is finally disposed
oi the people will Â«Uil employ the Democratic
party to support their purposes and to carry
them into effect. When they do thus employ
that party 1. for one, do not want it to be shat
tered and dismembered, but to be â¢trouy,
united and efficient.
Therefore I snail caÂ»t my vote for William
Jennings Bryan and Arthur Sewall, the candi
dates in due and regular form chosen by a
majority of that convention. I regret that I
cannot be in full accord on the question of
finance with the sentiment of :be late con
vention, bnt if my position seems inhar
monious with the usual attitude of a candi
date toward his party it should be remem
bered that the conditions are also unusual.
In nominating me I must assume that the
convention was not unaware of my financial
views as expressed in public utterances, and
that it was induced to accord me that dls
tinguithed honor in view of the fact that
under the constitution a Governor of this
State has no official connection whatever with
matters pertaining to the National currency.
It was apparent at Chicago and Buffalo, an
iÂ« expressed at every gathering of citizens
where public questions are discussed, that the
people nre dissatisfied with the present condi
tion of public affairs, and I am in sympathy
with every movement, not revolutionary in
character, which seeks to take burdens from
the shoulders of the masses and to restore
prosperity and peace to all the people.
When the Republican Legislature adjourned
in May. 1896, it leit a record behind it which
every Democrat and independent voter in the
State believed would be at issue before the
people this fall. No question purely National
should be perrtkted to divert onr people in
tnis State election from pronouncing by a
change of administration a verdict against
this record. â¢ â¢ â¢ The people have de
stroyed all vestige of a political boss in the
Democratic party and I belk-ve they will
annihilate bossiÂ«m in tde Republican party.
It ts not important that I, or any other par
ticular individual, should be elected Gover
nor. It is important that the power of one
man should not be perpetuated by two years
more oi Republican executive control. Yours,
John Boto Thacher.

TORTURED BY WHITECAPS
Brutal Treatment of an Onto
Farmer Suspected of
Dishonesty.
Alternately Strung Up by the Hels
or Buried Until Near to
Death.
TOLEDO. Ohio, Sept. 20.â 1t was learned
to-day that a brutal ivhitecapping outrage
occurred within a few miles of Toledo ten
days ago, but the region is so terror
stricken that no one dared to carry word
to the authorities until to-day. A farmer
named Huntsman, living near Holland, in
this county, was the victim. His two
chidren were returning from Holland on
September 9, when two men overtook
them and accused them of finding and
secreting a pocketbook containing $80.
This was denied and the children w. re
searched.
The same men went to Huntsman's
house that night and insisted that the
pocketbook was in the possession of the
family.
They finally went away threatening
vengeance. The following night a band
of a dozen or more men took Huntsman
from his bed and beat him ou.rageouslv.
That done, he was strung up for a few
moments to a tree. He was then lowered
again, beaten and partially buried. Given
a chance* to make a statement, he claimed
to be innocent and was banged by tbe
heels and again buried. He was then
notified to leave tbe county within twelve
hours or die.
The man's jaw was broken ani he was
frightfully bruised, but his fear was so
great that ne and his family remained in
tbe woods without food or medical atten
tion for the following two days.

DESPERATE BATTLE FOUGHT
AT EL HAFIR.
The Invading Party Giins a Signal
Victory After a Stubborn
Resistance.
CAIRO. Egypt, Sept 20.â A dispatch
from the Angio-E/yptian expedition states
that Dongola, the objective point of the
expedition, has been taken without meet
ing with any resistance from the der
vishes, the place being unoccupied.
The dispatch adds that the town of El
Hafir, north of Dongola, to which place
the dervishes retreated yesterday, was
captured after a hot engagement. After
the place bad fallen into the lianas of the
expedition, the Egyntains captured
*wenty-seven grain-laden boats, the loss
of which will prove a severe biow to the
dervishes. The latter made desperate at
tempts to recapture tbe boats, but a heavy
tire was poured into them by the troops
and tbe gunboats, and they were finally
compelled to abandon their attempts to
regain possession of the boats aud their
cargoes.
Af.er their defeat the entire dervish
force retreated southward upon Dongola.
At tbe same time the expedition's steam
ers started for tbe same place, and being
the quicker reached there before the
dervishes. The city was found to be de
serted by warriors, and the steamers at
once landed a force of infantry to hold it
until the arrival of the main Dody of the
expedition.
At the time the dispatch was sent the
dervishes were approaching Doneola over
land, and scouts reported that they were
carrying mans* of their wounded with
them. Included among tbe wounded are
some of the most noted chiefs.
It is expected that, as the dervishes are
without food or other stores, they will
make a most desperate attempt to again
get possession of Dongola.
El Hatir was not taken by the troops
until after a most stubborn resistance on
the part of the dervishes had been over
come. The riflemen of the latter fought
behind well-made mud forts and in
trenches that were strewn with mats.
These defenses, however, were soon
wrecked by the heavy fire of the Egyptian
artillery and the Maxim battery that was
manned by tbe Connaught Rangers. The
dervishes stood the tire bravely, but were
finally compelled to withdraw from the
place. Their cavalry took no part in the
engagement, remaining some distance off
in the desert and watching the result of
tbe battle. When the British and Egyp
tians landed the entire force retreated
southward.
The capture of the place was hailed
with delight by the natives, who have
long been harried by the dervishes. They
shouted, danced and sang in a frenzied
manner and hailed the expedition as their
deliverers.

the attack on Ei Hatir the dervishes were
outwitted. They all advanced on land to
meet the troops, thus permitting the gun
boats to slip past the town, sink one of
their steamers and hurry on to Dongola.
When tbe dervishes saw this move they

The Staffordshire regiment will follow

Notwithstanding the assertion oi the

BERLIN, Geemany, Sept, 20.â Before
starting for his chateau at Alt-Aussee,
Styria, Prince Hobenlobe, the Imperial
Chancellor, paid a visit to Count yon
Munster-Ledenburg, German Embassador
to France, who is spending his holidays
at his estate in Hanover. Count yon
Munster wfll return to Paris on October
5, and it is needless to say that as the re
sult of the visit of Prince Hobenlohe he is
fully primed as to the attitude he is ex
pected to observe throughout the sojourn
of the Cut at the French capital, which,
it is understood, is to keep in the back
ground and watch events. Prince Hohen
lohe will remain in Styria tor a fortnight,
but he has his plaus for the conduct of in
ternational matters during his absence
from Berlin fully mapped out, and every
body concerned is fully instructed in his
line of procedure^ Baron Marschall yon
Bieberstein, German Minister of Foreign
Affairs, is now in Baden, hut his leave of
absence will end on October 12.
In view of the absence of the chief Min
isters of the Government for tbe next
three weeks the foreign Office certainly
cannot be very greatly concerned over an
immediate crisis in the East. What little
diplomatic activity exists now centers in
Vienna.
The Hon. Michael Herbert, First Secre
tary to the British Embassy aÂ» Constanti
nople, who so efficiently acted as the sub
stitute of Sir Philip Currie, the British
Embaseador to Turkey during the recent
absence of the latter in England, is on his
way to England on leave of absence. He
remained four days in Vienna, leaving
there on Friday. While he was staying in
tue Austrian capital Mr. Herbert bad
three interviews with Count Goluchowski,
the Austrian Minister of Foreign Affairs,
who is very plainly showing his desire to
make for himself a historic name as a
statesman by taking the initiative in deal
ing with the Sultan. Only time can de
cide whether he is a fusJy intarmecWler or
a far-sighted politician.
Mr. Herbert, according to reliable ad
vices which have been received here, ad
â¼l<ed Connt Goluchowski to disregard the
oft-repeaied Turkish menaces of a general
massacre of Christians in Turkey. If the
powers collectively, or England alone,
should send a fleet to Constantinople, Mr.
Herbert does not believe thai the Sultan
possesses the power to effect a general
slaughter of Europeans in the TurciÂ«h
capital city, and he so expressed himseif
to Count Goluchowski. Mr. Herbert has
also been permitted to repeat to the Aus
tria.i Foreign Minister his estimate, which
he sent to the British Foreign Office, of
the forces on land and at sea which would
be necessary to keep order at Constanti
nople in the event that the Sultan should
be deposed.
Em peror Francis Joseph of Austria pre
sided over a ministerial council in Vienna
on Friday, at which Count Goluchowski,
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Count Ba
deni, Prime Minister, Baron Banffy, Hun
garian Premier, and Baron Kallay de
Nagy-Kalie, Chief of the Imperial Finan
cial Department, were present. Tnis
council is the last that will be held before
the Emperor starts on bis programme, his
work beginning with the Galician military
maneuvers and the Hungarian maneuvers
inaugurating tbe iron gates of tbe Danube
canal and his visit to Bucharest. Since
the council was held the semi-official
press of Vienna have continued their at
tacks upon Lord Salisbury without abate
ment. The Berlin official circle seems to
have got an inkling of the change in
the Austrian policy, which is iess pro-
Russian than formerly. Probably a fac
tor influencing Count Goluchowski in de
ciding upon the change was the declar
ation made by Baron Banfty at the coun
cil tdat the dissolution of the Hungarian
Parliament had been fixed to take place
in October and that the new parliamen
tary elections would be held in Novem
ber. These events, he said, must not be
accompanied by the reproach that Hun
gary had been made a tool of the Czar.
The anti-Turkish meetings which have
been held in the various populous centers
throughout Germany show a rapidly in
creasing concern in the massacres of
Christians in ihe Sultan's dominion. The
Catholic clergy have not as yet taken so
active a part in the agitation as the
Protestant clergy have, but the Catholic
laity are subscribing liberally to the Ar
menian relief funds and the Centrist
newspapers urge the necessity of dealing
with the Sultan promptly, vigorously and
finally. Dr. Lieber, the leader cf the
Centrist party in the Reichstag, proposes
to demand that the Government adopt an
uneqnivocal policy in regard to the Turk
ish massacres of Christians just as soon
aa the Reichstag resumes its sittings in
November.
Trre Reichsbote, a Conservative organ,
poure out torrents of wrath at the alleged
German apathy in the matter of -the
slaughter of Christians, but the question
is whether or not Germany is apathetic.
It is true that the Government supprehses
any tendency on the part of the semi
official press toward public excitement
ngainst the Porte, yet from every quarter
of the empire coma signs that the great
political parties, the Conservative, Cen
trist. National, Liberal and Freisinnige,
are waking up and will make it impossi
ble for the existence of a Government
having no distinctive German policy in
regard to Turkey, merely saying "ditto' 1
to the Russian or Austrian policy.
The English so-called dynamite plot is
suspected here, where police dodges are
possibly better known than in England,
as being a trick upon the Czar. The
National Zeitung in an article upon the
subject Â»aye: "The English newspapers
have made a tremendous commotion over
the affair, their articles being obviously
aimed at operating upon the sensibilities
of the Czar.
The Vossische Zeitong, however, ex
presses belief that there really is, or was,
a Fenian-anarchist conspirac}-, though the
jjapÂ«?r is not aware how widely divergent
Fenian ism and anarchism are.
The Vorwaerts, organ of the Socialists,
views the matter naturally as a police
plot, and assails Chief Inspector Melville
ot the Scotland Yard police as the foster
father of tbe Berlin anarchists.
The Neuste Nachrichten and many
other newsparers express hope that at
last England will rouse herself to energetic
action against the anarchist pestilence
which nurse bat her bosom and join the
Continental Governments in the adoption
of measures for its total extinction.
The first international woman's con
gress was opened here Saturday in the
great hail of the Berlin city buildings, and
its sessions will last a week. Six hundred
women delegates are present, and the
women are in attendance as representa- |
tives of the women of Buda-Pesth. The pro- |
ceedings yesterday were restricted to mere j
formalities and to-day was devoted to a I
inception of the delegates, The matters of
international importance to be discussed
are the woman s rights question, upon
which Mrs. F. C. French of Washington
and Mrs. Wright Sewall of Indianapolis will
speak, amons others. The lollowing days
will be devoted tv the discussion of ques
tions affecting the protection of children,
early education in female schools, employ
ment of women, wages, hours and kindred
subjects.
Iv the discussion upon the subject of
workingwomen's clubs Mrs. Thomas Kirk- j
bridge of Philadelphia and Mrs. Ormiston
Chant of London will speak, and these
ladies with others will address the con
gress upon tbe fight of women against
alcohol, and other themes, including
woman suffrage and provision for the or
phan poor. It is quite plain that the con
gress will have a big field to traverse.
The socialist executive committees have
placed upon tLe Agenda booK of the con
gress demands for woman suffrage and
equal legal rights for women with men.
A meeting of female socialists has ap
pointeii special delegates to the congress.
The Kreuz Zeitung announces that the
Conservatives of Germany are beginning \
to share the indignation of the people of
England at the Sultan's inhuman Govern
ment, but do not lavor the English de
mand for the deposition of the Sultan.
The best scheme to be followed, the paper
thinks, would be the formation o: a Euro
pean commission to control the Sultan
and hh Ministers by making the appoint
ment of the latter, as well as the appoint
ment of territorial governors, subject to
the approval of the Embassadors.
The Czar and Czarina are timed to ar
rive at Darmstadt on October 10. The
Kaiser will not go to Darmstadt to meet
them.
Tbe rupture between the editors of the
Vorwaens and Herr Liebicnecht, the So
cialist leader in the Reichstag, continues.
Fischer, one of the participants in the
quarrel, urges a halt, representing that
tbe display of the Socialist dirty linen in
public would only be to play into the ene
my's hand, and he promises a private set
tlement of the differences between Herr
Liebicnecht and the editors.

BALL-PLAYER'S SUICIDE.
Edward N. Crane, the Famous
Pitcher, Takes a Dose of
Poison.
His Brilliant Career en tb.3 Diamond
Field Fol'owid by One of
Dissipation.
ROCHESTER, N. V., Sept. 20.â Edward
N. Crane, who was in his time one of the
nnest baseball pitchers in the country,
ended his life at Congress Hall last night.
He had been drinking heavily of late and
became despondent. An empty bottle of
poison on the dresser this morning tells
the story.
Edward Crane has for twelve years been
prominently identified with the National
(jam*. He first sprang into prominence
in 1887, when he pitched a phenomenal
series and won the international cham
pionship for Toronto. He was eagerly
sought after the next year and went to
New York for a princely sum. He won
the championship of the world for the
New Yorks over the St. Louis Browns, the
champions of the American Association.
He duplicated his phenomenal work the
next year. Since that time he did some
steady playing, but for the pant two years
his work has been ragged.
Last year he was released by Toronto
and played the season out with Rochester.
This year be began with Providence, was
thrown to Springfield and was left in the
lurch. He was engaged a* an umpire by
President Pat Powers, but did not give
satisfaction. Since then he has been given
over to dissipation.
The body of the dead man will probably
be taken to Boston for burial. He leaves a
widow and one child. An inquest will be
beid to-morrow.

ENDLESS DELEGATIONS.

The Public Clamor for the Major's
Printed Speeches Is Beyond
All Precedent.
CANTON, Ohio, Sept. 20.â Major Mc-
Einley closed last night the most arduous
week of the campaign. He remained at
home all day to-day and in the evening
received a lew personal friends. Thore
were no callers of a National or political
reputation.
Major McKinley has shaken bands with
upward of 60,000 people during the past
week and has had in the aggregate about
100,000 visitors. This week he will have
delegations every day after Mopday and
will have to make as many format speeches
as he did last week. The speeches which
Major McKinley made in August, to
gether with some account of the circum
stances which called them forth, have
been printed and bound and will be ready
for distribution this week. The demand*
for his speeches made between the day
ot his nomination and the Ist or August
and his >etter of acceptance, is unabated.
The published speeches now number
sixty, but the additions for September
will brine the total up to more than 100.
Major McKinley was in excellent spirits
to-day. He thinks the situation is im
proving daily. Several callers to-day lrom
the far West have told him that Wyom
ing, Colorado and Idaho have been thor
oughly canvasaed and that there is ample
foundation for the belief that he will carry
them all, but with small pluralities.
The news which Major McKinley had
to-day from the Pacinc tilope is reassur
ing. He is informed that if the present
exertion which Republicans are making
there be continued every t^tate on the Pa
cific Coast will be carried by the Ropubli
ca v s.
Senator Cullom assured Major McKin
ley that Illinois would etve him 100,000
plurality, and Congies^inan McCleary of
Minnesota said that the sound-money idea
would prevail in his State and that it was
growing stronger every hour.
Senator Tburston is continent that the
Republicans will carry Nebraska and told
Major McKinley thut he need have no
further apprehension on that score.
C. L. Kurtz, chairman of the Republi
can State Committee, wires to-day that
Senator-el- ct J. B. Foraker will take the
stump this week in Ohio, and devote all
the rest of the campaign to the wort of
making political speeches. He has been
asked to make a trip to the Pacific Coast.
Mr. Kurtz expects to have five speeches
from Thomas B. Reed of Maine in Ohio
witnin a short time.
Among the telegrams received to-day
were the following:
CHEYENNE, Wye, Sept 20.â McKinley and
Hobart Club, 900 members organized, send
preetinjts and assurances of support. Wyoming
Republicans for protection and sound money.
John G. Baird, President
FLAGSTAFF. Ariz., Sept. 20.â Republicans
of Coconino County, Arizona, Fend greetings
and assurances of unanimous indorsement in
the convention yesterday of the Republican
nominations and platform throughout.
R. B. Burks, Chairman.
Telegrams were received notifying Major
McKinley of the formation of a large num
ber of Republican clubs.
BRYAN'S QUIET SARRATS.
The Monxinei Occupies coin's Old few
at Church. AÂ«rnÂ«>.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Sept. 20â Mr.
Bryan's plans for this evening were
rather hastily changed in order to
permit him to make the neces
sary railroad connections to fill his en
gagement in Dover, Del., to-morrow. In
stead of remaining here until to-morrow
morning, he left to-night over the Penn
sylvania Railroad for Baltimore at 10
o clock, and will leave that city to-morrow
at 6:10 for Dover.
The Sabbath day was occupied by the
candidate in securing a much-needed rest.
He retired last evening at midnight im
mediately upon his return from Balti
more, and slept until 8 o'clock this morn
ing, when he arose much refreshed. He
remained quietly indoors until 11 o'clock,
when he attended service at the New York
Avenue Presbyterian Church.
The announcement of this fact at
tracted to the church a number of per
sons not accustomed to worship there, but
the edifice was by no means crowded.
Mr. Bryan was not a stranger to the mem
bers of New York Avenue Church. Dur
ing his Congressional career, and while
Rev. William Bartlert was pastor, Mr.
Bry ;n was a frequent attendant upon the
services. He usually escorted his father, a
tall, striking looking man, with heavy
gray locks, who was blind or nearly so.
To-day Mr. Bryan had a seat in the pew
occupied by President Lincoln who at
tended tbe church under the pastorate of
Dr. Gurley. Rev. Dr. Radcline, the pas
tor, bad no knowledge ol the intended
presence of the Presidential candidate
un til he reached tbe house. There was only
the slightest reference ,in any part of the
service to the pending political struggle.
In his prayer the preacher asked that
in this time of commotion the Lord would
be with the people and that the President
whom they might select would be one of
the Lord's own choosing, giving the coun
try "peace and honor.' 1 Dr. Radcliffe's
text was taken from the story of Solomon's
dream: "Ask What I Shall Give You."
At the close of the services Mr. Bryan
went forward to the pulpit, as bad been
his custom, and spoke a few words to the
preacher. Many of the congregation took
advantage of the opportunity to press for
ward and pay their respects. As he left
the church there was slight cheering by
the crowd that waited for his appearance.

West Thirty-fifth street. The policemen
gave chase and captured Walsh. O'Brien

SCOTLAND YARD'S
SENSATION DIES
The Dynamite Scare Fails
to Create a Popular
Panic.
A SUBJECT OF DERISION.
Dubious Methods Employed by
the Sleuths to Startle
the World.
NICHOLAS IS VERY NERVOUS.
Every Precaution Is Taken for His
Safety When He Lands on

rCopyrljht 1896 by the New York Times.J
LONDON, Eko., Sept. 20.â The London
newspapers made most frenzied efforts to
invest the capture of Tynan and his col
leagues with tremendous importance, and
they have really given more space and
wilder headlines to the affair than the
actual dynamite explosions used to get a
dozen years ago; but all their clamor
failed to create anything like a popular
panic. Indeed, so far as I can see, "the man
in the street" is deriding the whole thing.
Scotland Yard gave its case all away at
tbe very outset, in its eagerness for newspa
per flattery, by explaining how it had been
warned from America that these terrible
conspirators were coming, and by telling
how it had shadowed all of them every
hour Bince they had landed. Upon re
flection people do not find this such an
extraordinary feat, and, moreover, they
have been growing suspicious about the
relations between Scotland Yard and the
Clan-na-Gael ever since Le Caron's revela
tions. In this present case, for instance,
it is asked bow we can be sure that the
very spies who sent the warning of
Tynan's coming, did not furnish the
money for Tynan to come with. Aside
from this there is the fact that none of
these criminal idiots have done anything
except get drunk and. proclaim desperate
resolves to barrooms full of strangers.
The chances are twenty to one against
either Tynan or the two fellows arrested
at Rotterdam being nanded over to Eng
land, and it is a matter of grave doubt if
the English officials ever expected or de
sired such action. There is, indeed, prob
ably enough evidence to put Ivory on
trial, possibly to convict him, and this,
with the reclame of the seizures at Bou
logne and Rotterdam, will give Scotland
Yard a sufficient advertisement. It is
noteworthy that in Ireland, Tynan, Kear
ney and Haines are everywhere repudi
ated as frauds of the lowest order. Natur
ally, Ivory's presence in Scotland associ
ated the plot at once with the impending
visit of the Czar. Yet nothing could be
more unlikely than that they had any
connection, for the physical force group of
Irishmen always have cheers for Russia
in her assumed capacity as the enemy of
England. Stiil, the deduction seems to
have been taken seriously by the Czar
himself, or at least by those responsible
for his safety.
Not only have precautions at Leith and
on the rouie to Balmoral been increased
until all that part of Scotland is in some
thing like a state of siege, but the exact
time of the Czar's arrivalin Leith harbor
and all the subsequent timetables by rail
are still kept unsettled. It is probable
that he will reach Leith on Monday, but
not even that is officially decided.
The police of Paris are stirred by this
sensational outcry into making domicil
iary visits all over the city, and I am ad
vised from the Foreign Office that not
only will new passports be needed by
straneers who visit France to see the re
ception of the Czar, but it will be well also
to so and register one's name at tbe Bu
reau oi Foreign Residents.
The Paris papers are haying great fun
over the question of a uniform in which
President Faure can prof erly receive the
imperial guests. This notion was started
as a journalistic joke, but President Faure
took it seriously and bad his tailors make
and submit a lot of designs.
It is understood that the Ministry vetoed
this pleasing project, but M. Faure got
out of the dress schemes submitted tbe
basis of an idea for a distinctive uniform
to wear while reviewing the troops, and
this uniform he has been wearing all the
week at the Aneouleme maneuvers. It is
a riding cOÃtume consisting of a black
hussar jacket, heavily braided, tight
mouse-colored trousers, worn inside van
dyke boots, a low black slouched bat.
with a curling brim and a short nut-brown
overcoat, cut rather like a cavalry officer's
hooded cloak. Thus attired M. Faure has
ridden about on a light chestnut steed,
followed by an Elysee groom in a French
blue coat and a silk hat with a tri-color
cockade on it. The effect oi this on the
army has not been reported, but the boule
vards are still holding their sides with
merriment.
One of the favorite pleasantries i 9 to the
effect that the peasants of La Charente all
firmly believed that the groom was the
president. This jesting seems to be all
good-natured enough, but none tbe iess
ridicule is a sharper pointed weapon in
France than in some otuer land*, and if
M. Faure were to show that he resented
this chaffing he would be made to suffer
at once. Fortunately, he has a very
cheery temperament and displays such
naive ecstasy in being President, even
when he is called tbe "shop-waiker of the
republic," tnat it is to the genial side of
the popular mind that he irresistibly ap
peals. Harald Feedehick.

CLEVELAND, Ohio, Sept. 20.â The cit
izens of Bedford, twelve miles south of
this city, are horror-stricken over a highly
sensational murder which took place there
late this afternoon.
James McMillan, who had separated
from his wife, decoyed her from her
father's house, kidnaped her, drove to a
dense wood, and there hacked her throat
with a jackknife. Pursuers frightened
him away. He stole a horse and buggy
and Btarted across the country, pursued
by halt a dozen men in buggies. If they
capture him there is apt to be another
death.
NAMES OF BATTLE-SHIPS
California, Alabama and Penn
sylvania Will Probably
Be Selected.
Numerous Suggestions Are Made as
to Names for the Six New
Gunboats.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Sept. 20.â For
fully three months the question of naming
not only tbe new torpedo-boats, but the
six composite gunboats and the three
newest battle ships, has been before Secre
tary Herbert. In some cases the plan bai
been to allow the Secretary under the adÂ»
ministration in which the vessel is
launched to choose the name rather than
tbe one under which she has been planned
or which has made the contract for her
construction ; but there are also cases in
which the name has been given when a
vessel's keel has been laid. This last np
pears also to be a familiar practice in Eng
land and other foreign countries, esreo
ia Ily in cases of larpe ships a long time
under construction. It is probable, there
fore, that Secretary Heroert will avail
hitu-eif of his privilege to name the new
battle-ships when the contracts for them
are given out, or soon afterward. Indeed,
it has bean intimated that tbe three States
selected are California, Alabama and
Pennsylvania.
The first of these names ia presumably
suggested in part by the lact that one of
the snips, as in the case of the Oregon,
will be built on the Pacific Coast. Ala
bama Is the Secretarj 's own State, and,
although there is already a Montgomery
in the navy, it ia not nulikely that he will
make this selection. Pennsylvania is a
good name for a battle-ship, and the fact
that the Cramps have built so many of
oar vessels would be an additional reason
for its selection.
As to the six gunboats, the applicants
for standing sponsors to them are numer
ous. Such names as Allegheny, Birming
ham, Bridgeport, Chattanooga, Chelsea,
Germantown, Gloucester, Lexington, Ken
esaw, Marietta. New Bedford, New Lon
don, Norfolk, North Point, Niagara, Ta
coma, Vicksburg and Wheeling will sug
gest the variety of applications and there
are others, like Albany, Cleveland,
Omaha, Pittaburg and St. Louis.
Tne board which is planning a reserve
fleet system for the navy is understood to
be considering three yards from which to
select a station for laying up ships in or
dinary on the Atlantic coast. They are
the Brooklyn, the Portsmouth and the
League Island yards. Each has points in
its favor, and it is possible that two of
them will be used. Each of these has the
advantage of being situated directly at a
great manufacturing and commercial city,
where there is not only plenty of labor at
command, but ship building material of
all sons, with abundant supplies. When
a Bhip is laid np in reserve, it is with the
intent of having her ready to be put in
commission at short notice.
Soon a similar station will be selected
for the Pacific Coast.
Torpedo boats will be laid up in reserve
like cruisers, monitors and battleships,
but for them sheds will be constructed,
and it ia not unlikely that they may be
found at several navy yards along the
coast, since these craft are essentially for
local defense and should be ready to act
promptly, and each section of the coast
have its share of them.

SAN JOSE, Cal., Sept. 30.â The inani

Cyclers' Gun Club of this city took place
â¢ to-day and attracted a large crowd to the
Cyclers' Club's new ' shooting grounds on
the Poihemus tract. The visiting team
was accompanied by many members of
the club and a number of ladies. The
scores made were very poor, but this was
accounted for by the poor light due to the
cloudy day and the fact that the blue
rocks were thrown ;iow. The match was
won ;by the Garden City Cyclers' : team,
with a score of 208 to ; 192 for the visiting
team. The marksmen with their respec

The Senatorial Nominee Predicts
a Decisive Republican
Victory.
SEHTIMENT IN SAN DIEGO.
Prominent Democrats Forsake the
Chicago Platform and
Nominees.
SAN JOSE. Cal., Sept. 20.-Hon. H. V.
Morehouse, the Republican nominee for
State Senator in the Thirty-first District,
in speaking of ' the political outlook said:
"McKinley will be elected President and
Santa Clara County will give a large vote
for the Republican nominee. lam a Re
publican and as such am in perfect ac
cord with the declaration of principles as
set. forth in the National Republican plat
form. I firmly ; . believe in protection and
I believe that the depressed business con
ditions of the country following the un
wise policy of the Democratic j party in
overthrowing the McKinley tariff has
taught the people of these United States
that prosperity will not return except
under the leadership of McKiriley and the
Republican party. The country must re
turn to protection and sound money must
be the only ' money " consistent with
National honor.
"One thing is certain: the money issue
is beyond question secondary to s prosper
ity. j What we want is business, and when
ever factories are opened, our people em
.ployed, our markets restored to our own"
people and our country once more in the
prosperous condition it always has been
under Republican rule, then money will
regulate itself. There is one political
truth beyond controversy : the Republican
party has been the only party which has
dealt with and established the finances of
the country on a sound money basis, and
it will be true to the best interests of all
the people. It has always been the party
of honesty and principle. It will carry
the country. There is no fear of McKin
ley election.
"In this county we have never had be
fore in its history such splendid organiza
tion and such harmony ill the party
ranks. . Dissension has been laid aside
and the county will give a larger Republi
can majority than ever before. Our local
ticket is strong; politically. Every man
nominated is especially qualified for the
position for which he was placed before
the people. I have no fears of the result.
It must be remembered that Santa Clara
County has a very intelligent and superior
class of people, and the Wilson bill has
been very injurious to the business inter
ests of our people. There are no defec
tions in our ranks .and there is no doubt
of cur pieces*."'
THEY SUPPORT McKINLEY.
Prominent San Diego- Democrats J3e
tt ounce the Chicago Platform.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Sept. Some of
the most prominent men in the .city, who
have been Democrats, all their lives, will
Tote for McKinley this fall. As a general
rule, it is tbe financial question that drives
them into the Republican party. Some,
however, have other reasons. One promi
nent Democrat, who did not wish his
name used just yet, said:
"The reasons why I won't vote for
Bryan are: First, I will not vote for a man
who attacks the highest tribunal in the
land; second, who holds that the Federal
Government has no right to send troops to
quell a disturbance in a State .where the
local authorities are powerless to enforce
order; third, who stirs up discontent and
strife and endeavors to destroy the con
fidence that is the foundation ot business."
Following are the views of several lead
ing Democrats who will vote for Mc-
Kinley:
Major Levi Chase â From the time the
Democratic convention was held in Chi
cago my mind has been made up to sup
port McKinley, for the reason that the
silver issue is the most important of tne
campaign, and I am, therefore, willing to
sustain McKiniey on tnat one issue alone.
Aside from that, there are features of the
Democratic platform that are disgraceful
and anarchical and would result in the
ruination of the country if carried out.
But silver is the controlling feature in my
mind. 1 have come to the conclusion that
it will not do to vote for Palmer, for that
would amount to a half vote lor Bryan.
Xhe only way, therefore, to make my vote
effective is to vote for McKinley. I have
been a Democrat all my life, having voted
the Democratic ticket first in 1844, and
from that day. to this*. But i cannot re
main with the organization styling itself
the Democratic party.
A. Biochman â 1 don't consider that the
Chicago platform is a Democratic plat
form. A vote for a gold J democrat would
be . a vote thrown away. I have all my
life voted for the President on the Demo
cratic ticket. In voting the Republican
ticket this year I don't consider myself a
Republican, but I consider I am voting
for the best interests of the country.
Samuel Lockwood â I have voted '.' the
Democratic ticket for sixty-three years. ' I
will vote for McKinley,, because it is my
duty.to cast 1 my vote fora man who, if
elected,. will carry out the only 5 poHcy for
the safety of the country. McKinley's elec
tion will also restore confidence in money
circles, and there is no more timid thing
in the world that capital. .
Putnam . Field â 1 will work ' and , vote
against Bryan. I have been, a Democrat
as long as I can remember, but I want-to
see Bryan beaten. ' ."
F. W. Steamsâl am a Democrat, but I
am going to vote for McKinley. .He
represents what I think is best for the
country. -â¢
Among other Democrats of prominence
in the city who will vote for McKinley are:
George W.'Marston, merchant; Dr., R. M.
Powers, president of the Bank of 'â¢â  -. Com

SCORES JUDGE PUTERBAUGH.
Letter Issued by San Diego County*
' Republican Central Committee.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., 20.â The Republican
County Central Committee- has issued a
public letter scoring Judge George Puter
baugh for running independently for Su
perior Judge. Puterbaugh was a candi
date before the Republican Convention
and was defeated. In response to a peti
tion signed by about 1000 citizens he con
sents to run independently, and wrote a
letter charging that the late convention
was dominated by bosses and that the
vote was corrupt and unfair. The com
mittee says:
We regret that a lifelong Republican should
feel so sore over not being the nominee of a
county convention that he should, on the re
quest of Democrats, Populists and disap
pointed seekers of office, attempt to destroy
his party, defeat its nominees and befoul the
political home where be has so long rested.
The favorite cry of a disappointed office-seeker
Is corruption and bossism and this letter is no
exception to the general rule.
The convention was composed of 247 dele
gates, chosen a', open caucuses and primaries
by 1995 Republicans of this county; these
delegates were a representative body of citi
zens who would not submit to the dictation of
any man or set of men.
A candidate who has sought a nomination
at the hands of a convention, and after a free
and fair fight has not obtained the coveted
honor, is not justified in seeking to defeat his
successful rival by violating his implied
pledge to abide by the decision of the conven
tion. Such conduct is politfcal treason, belit
tles the man who attempts it, and merits tbe
condemnation of all loyal members of the
party.
SIERRA COUNTY NOMINEES.

DOWNIEVILLE, Cal., Sept. 20.â The
Sierra Count}' Republican Convention met

Turner in the chair. Hon. Stanley A.
Smith was nominated as candidate for Su
perior Judge by acclamation. He is the

George C. Perkins for Senator were

R. Castagna, H. K. Turner. As nominees
for Supervisors, J. M. Gorham of the
Fourth District, J. W. Phillips of Forest
and W. T. Luther of Downieville are
chosen.
The Situation in Arieona.
TUCSON, A. T., Sept. 20.â There is much
comment here on the action of the Demo
cratic Territorial convention in its strong
indorsement of Governor Franklin and
equally strong denunciation of President
Cleveland, as the convention was abso
lutely controlled by the Territorial admin
istration. Two years ago the territorial
convention indorsed Cleveland and the
Territorial administration in unqualified
terms. From the delegations elected to
this Republican Territorial convention, to
be held on Tuesday next, it is safe to pre
dict that Jhe St. Louis Republican plat
form, especially the souna-mony plank,
will be indorsed and a sound-money can
didate nominated for Congress. This,
with Democratic and Populist tickets in
the field, will give the Republicans much
advantage.

EUREKA, Cal., Sept. 20.â The silver

MONTEREY'S NOTED HALL
The Constitutional Convention
Meeting-Place About to
Be Sold.
Will Re Purchased by the City and
Maintained in Its Present
Condition.
MONTEREY, Cal., Sept. 20.â Colton
Hall, built during the days of Mexican
supremacy, used as a meeting-place of the
convention that drafted the first constitu
tion of California as a State, and now be
longing to the trustees of the Monterey
school district, is about to be sold to tbe
city of Monterey and the proceeds used in
completing and furnishing the new school
building.
On September 1, 1849, the convention
called by Bennett Riley, then Military
Governor of California, was organized in
Monterey, and Colton Hall was chosen as
the place of meeting because it was at
that time the only plastered house in the
new Territory. Here tbe State constitu
tion that served California for thirty years
was drawn up and approved by an earnest
but probably the most youthful body of
legislators ever assembled to frame such
an important work. Nine of the men
present were under 30 years of acre.
twenty-three between 30 and 40, twelve
between 40 and 50, and only* four over 50
years of ase. Of the forty-eight only
thirty-six were American citizens, eleven
came from New York, six from New Eng
land ana five from Maryland, while of
native L'alifornians there were seven and
the delegates of foreign birth numbered
five. Tne famous pioneers Gum and
Burnett, McCarver and Semple, as well as
the Calif orniaLS, Carillo, the stanch
friend and ally of Governor Pio Pico, and
General Vallejo, took prominent parts in
this convention, and great euns of ora
tory thundered upon the pros and cons of
the question of making the new State free
or in favor of slavery, that being the most
momentous subject agitating Congress at
the time.
For tbe last few year- this historic land
mark has been used as a public school,
and since the burning of the school build
ing in 1893 has been the only available
place for the carrying on of educational
work. It is proposed, however, that the
city buy it and convert it into headquar
ters for the officials of the city govern
ment, and while keeping it in Rooa repair
in no way mar or destroy its historic char
acter and appearance. It is believed the
sum accruing from its sale will be amply
sufficient for furnishing the new school
house recently built, and that teachers
and pupils will be able to move into more
commodious ana better arranged quarters
at the beginning of the next school term.

BUIBUN, Cal , Sept. 20.â The damage
resulting from the fire last evening was
not as great as at first . anticipated. If a
strong wind had prevailed the loss would

Site.
FAST MOVING FORWARD.
Passenger Trains Will Travel

PREPABING FOR A:CELEBRATION
Citizens Will Rejoice When the Last
Spike is Drivenâ Shepard's
Injunction Suit
FRESNO, CAt,, Sept 20.â The graders
on the Valley road nave reached Fresno
street in this city, two blocks from the
depot site. A fill at the junction of Q and
Diana streets has not been completed as
yet. It will be finished by Tuesday. Yes
terday about 1000 feet of track was laid,
bringing it to the "fill" at the foot of
Diana street. The track-layers will de
vote their attention to-morrow to the
finishing work on the track already laid.
Fifteen more grading teams arrived to
day and to-morrow forty will be at work.
The injunction proceedings instituted
by J. C. Shepard, who objects to the con
struction of tbe Railroad in front of his
residence on Q street, unless he is paid
exorbitant damages, will be heard before
Judge Risley in the Superior Court to
morrow morning. Shepard has been in
imical to the Valley road since the route
along Q street was selected, and he has
used every means to impede its entrance
to this city. Popular sentiment is very
strong against him. The Morning Re
publican exposed some of Sheuani's do
ings as an obstructionist, and he talked of
shooting the editor, John W. Short.
Shepard's place is haif a block from the
depot site of the railroad, and the graders
expect to reach "Snepardville," as the
debatable part of the street is now called,
by Tuesday evening. The Valley road
officials are confident that they will quash
the injunction, in which event the gradina
will proceed to the depot grounds.
The information was given to a Call
correspondent last night that the road
would be ready for passenger business
from this city on October L
The committee, which has in charee the

TUB POINT PINOS WRECK.
Heavy Swell* Are Completing the fte~
atruction of the M. Paul.
PACIFIC GROVE, Cal., Bept 20.â A
great deal of excitement was caused here
to-day by the report that the wrecked
steamer St. Paul, lying *>n the rocks near
Point Pinos lighthouse, had gone to pieces
during the storm which raged here night
before last and yesterday. As a result all
day long people in carriages, on horse
back and a-wheel were seen gome out to
the wreck. During the forenoon and far
in the afternoon, Moss Beach, near where
the St Paul went on the rocks, was lined
with weary pedestrians from Del Monte,
Mo.iterey and Pacific Grove, who had
walked six miles to view the wreck once
more before it went to pieces. .
The storm has affected the fated ship
very materially, and has weakened it so
that it will break up shortly. It has set
tled down some two. feet at the stern and
lists to port considerably more than after
it struct. Tbe heavy swells dash high
over the rear cabin, and part of tbe rail
has already been broken by the waves.
The cabins will soon succumb to the angry
waters. The St. Paul's old pilot, who
purchased tbe boat at auction for $25, is
expected here this week, when he will at
tempt to save whut be can of it, but if the
heavy swells do not cease there will not be
much left to save.

county presidents of the Young People's
Society of Christian Endeavor held a pre

Presbyterian Church of Salinas, all being
presidents of the several societies. A dis
cussion of the project developed a unani
mous sentiment in favor of forming a
union of the county societies, and October
27 was finally selected as the day of the
meeting.
EUREKA' S FIRST FAIR.
The Agricultural Association's Pavilion
Crowded With Exhibits for the
Opening Day.
EUREKE, Cal., Sept. 20.â The first fair
of the Eureka Agricultural and Mechani
cal Fair Association will be formally
opened to-morrow. The most sanguine
expectations of tbe committee in charge
have been realized. The only regret is
that the pavilion is not larger. Every
available foot of space in the exposition
building has been taken. Several home
merchants and many firms Â«of San Fran
cisco and Portland are unable to secure
places for their exhibits. Most of the
exhibits are already arranged, and before
Monday noon the big building will be
filled with beautiful and inte resting ex
hibits.
The race track has been put into ex
cellent condition, and the week's horse
and bicycle racing promises to be the best
ever held in this section.
The programme for the opening night
at the pavilion will consist of addresses by
President Daniel Murphy, Judge G. W.
Hunter and Mayor C. G. Stafford, a con
cert by Cassava's First Regiment band
and an electric display. A large number
of visitors are expected from outside
counties, especially from Del Norte and
Mendocino. The days have been appor
tioned as follows: Tuesday will be
Eureka day, Wednesday North Humboldt
day, Thursday Del Norte day, Friday
school child rens' day and Saturday South
Humbolt day.

Arrival of the Monterey Means
Additional Work for
Mechanics.
Marines Leave to Garrison the Port
Orchard Yardâ Overhauling the
Pensacola.
VALLEJO, Cal., Sept. 20.â The moni
tor Monterey has been ' the â  first ship-of
war to * come to the navy-yard and go
direct to the magazine wharf ' and dis
charge ammunition. Heretofore all fires
were drawn, all lights put out, the vessel
anchored in the stream, the ammunition
hoisted out of the powder magazine,
placed on lighters and towed to the maga
zine wharf, transferred to fla tears and
taken to the shell -or powder magazines
and carefully stowed away until the ship
was again ready to receive ' it. Times are
changing every day; the manner of put
ting up charges of powder is different and
less caution is necessary. It -was a wel
come sight to see the monitor coming up
the bay and go in dryaock Friday last, as
it means additional " work for the me
chanics. Captain Clark will soon assume
command, and Captain Ludlow will go
East on leave of absence.
\ .Residents of Vallejo and all interested
in navy-yard affairs, are pleased to learn
of 'the success of the Union Iron Works in
securing the building of two more ships
of war, as that which helps the company
helps the navy yard and merchants in
time.. It is expected that action will be
taken by the coming Congress to have the
channel widened between Vallejo and the
navy yard so that ships like the Oregon
and the battleships: to be constructed
could come to the navy yard* without fear
of grounding. ." . .. ,'
A draft of twenty marines left the nvay
yard early last ." week for Port Orchard.
The naval station at this place will here
after be garrisoned as at other yards. The
guard ,'. w ill -< be quartered , on board "the
United States . ship Nipsic â  until suitable
barracks are built on shore. ~ .
; Paymaster Skelding, paymaster of the
yard, will be detached on October 1, and
Paymaster W. "W. Barry, will take his j
place. The latter officer will bring his j
own clerk, and Pay Clerk Walter .Bollard
will be detached. Mr. Bollard , has been
an efficient * and * accommodating official, .
and his retirement will be regretted.
Captain Louis Kempff will assume I
charge of the receiving-ship Independence

The boiler and engines are being taken
out of the Pensacola. and rapid progress is

TRAGEDY IN SAN
LUIS REV VALLEY
Rancher Manuel Bellina
Killed by Albert J.
Foss.
PIERCED BY BUCKSHOT.
His Slayer Claims He Believed
He Was Firing Upon
a Prowler.
CONTRADICTORY STORIES TOLD.
The Victim Held a Mortgage on the
Eighty-Acre Ranch of Foss'
Mother.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Sept. 20.â San Luis
Rev Valley, which has been the scene of
many tragedies, added another bloody
page to its history last night, wnen Man
uel Beliina, a rancher living on tbe Pancho
Pico place, was inÃtantly killed by Albert
J. FO3S. The weapon was a shotgun and
a load of ten or twenty buckshot, fired
from a distance of not over thirty feet, en
tered Bellina's neck and breast, one shot
penetrating the heart. The killing has
features that point to premeditation. It
occurred at 10 o'clock, and there were-no
witnesses, thougti Albert Foss' mother
was not far distant, and saw the flash of
the gun. It was in her yard that Bellina
was shot.
Young Foss, who lives on his mother's
ranch and about 200 yards north of her
house, said he heard his dogs barking and
the cattle making a noise. Tuinking a
coyote had come onto tbe place, he took
his shotgun, loaded with buckshot, and
started out to see what was the matter.
He found nothing out of the way on his
place, and then went down past his moth
er's house.
Under the trees, not far from the house,
he saw a man skulking. He called out to
the stranger, but got no reply. The man
stopped and seemed to be cowering under
the trees. Foss called out again, but no
answer came, and then he shot. The man
dropped in his tracks. Foss said it was
too dark to see who the intruder was, and
that he shot because he believed the man
was there for some evil purpose.
Foss, who is aDout 25 years old, did not
coniess to the killing until toward the end
of the Coroner's inquest to-day. After he
had been questioned for some time be ad
mitted that he bad done the shooting, and
related his story. It was his aged mother,
who lives entirely alone, who was brutally
maltreated two years ago by Jose Chaves,
an Indian, who was sent to San Quentin
for forty years for the crime. Young Foss
testified t at it was the remembrance of
this crime, and the fact that his mother
was entirely unprotected, that caused him
to be suspicious and perhaps led him to
shoot quicker than he otherwise would.
When the stranger under the trees did not
answer he took it for granted that trouble

was brewing, and he shot first, not know
ing whether the intruder was armed or
not.
There was other testimony failing to
entirely corroborate Foss' story. His
mother said that Bellina had called on her
and was just leaving when he was killed-
She showed him to the door and he
started away. She went in the opposite
direction into the garden, and heard the
shot fired and saw the flash of the gun.
She ran up and saw that Bellina was the
victim, but she did not see her son. She
did not hear any words before the shoot*
ing.
It was learned at Oceanside during the
day that Bellina had a mortgage on Mrs.
Foss' eighty- acre ranch. He and young
Foss were not on eood terms, though no
serious trouble had occurred between
tbein.
Bellina was an uncle of Frank Bellina
of San Diego, and came originally from
Oakland. He was about 57 years of age.
The Coroner's iury rendered a verdict
that Bellina had come to his death from a
gunshot wound inflicted by A. J. Foss.
Coroner' Johnson issued a warrant for the
arrest of Foss, and Constable Hubbert
brought tiie man down to-nieht. He and
Foss are old friends and he did not place
his prisoner in jail, receiving the consent
of the District Attorney to keep him at a
hotel. The preliminary examination will
be held at Oceanside early this week.
POBILAND GARBOTERS.
Four Men Rob a Washington Stockman
of Hi* Monet/
PORTLAND, v Ob. ; Sept. 20.â B.
Nash, a Washington cattle-raiser, was the
victim of an uncommonly .' bold highway
robbery at noon to-day. He came to
.Portland on the forenoon train from Se
attle, purposing to go East to-night As
he was walking up town from â¢ the Union
depot he was accosted by two strangers,
one of wnom asked him for a match. This
led to a general conversation, the strangers
claiming also to be visiting here.' The
result was that the three boarded a car
and rode to Portland Heights.
After wandering. about a short time and
reaching a secluded spot, the three men
were pounced upon by two others, and, as
if by a preconcerted arrangement, Nash
was garroted by the four and robbed of
$250 in gold. In their hurry' to get away
;tbey overlooked $250 in currency he : had
in his inside coat, pocket. â â , - ; â¢
This is the story Nash told Chief of. Po
lice Minto this afternoon... He added that
he drew the money at the Seattle Court
house yesterday afternoon, and believes
the robbers followed him here from the
Sound. iii , . .

Streets.
FIVE HUNDRED IN LINE
Throngs of Visitors Partake of a
Barbecue at Agricult
ural Park.
FEAST, DANCE AND PROMENADE
An Outing of Thousands Who Gave
the Police Force Nothing
to Do.
BAN JOSE, Cal., Sept. 20.â The jour
neymen butchers of San Francisco, Oak
land and San Jose captured the city to
day, and from noon until dark they ruled
hupieme. They brought between 2000 and
3000 visitors to the city, and the streets
presented an animated appearance. The
excursions were the largest that ever
visited San Jose. Streetcars were jammed
all day and tbe livery stables and bicycle
shops did an extensive business. The
crowds were jolly ones, and they amused
themselves in every conceivable manner.
The hoodlum element was conspicuous
for its absence and everything passed off
quietly.
The Journeymen Batchers' Association
of San Francisco arrived in three trains,
thirty-five caT3 in all, shortly after 11
o'clock. The Oakland association came j
in about the same time, by way of Niies,
with ten cars. The excursionists were
met at the depot by tbe San Jose associa
tion. A procession was at once formed.
George Dwyer of San Jose was grand mar
shal. His aids were: Chief aid, Charies
Miller of San Jose; J. Lyons and R. C.
Kelley of San Francisco and J. Pickford
and Fred Knott Â«f Oakland.
The San Francisco association, headed
by a platoon of polict, was first in the
parade, followed by Oakland and San Jose.
Each division was headed by a band.
2 here were about 500 men in line, and
they presented a tine appearance in their
white aprons and shirts. The line of
march was from the broad-gauge oeDot,
along First to San Antonio, counter march
to Santa Clara street and out to Agricult
ural Park, where a picnic and barbecue
was held.
Between 4000 and 5000 people were at
Agricultural Park. The young man and
bis girl from the Potrero and tbe butcher
boy and his sweetheart were there in
numbers and they enjoyed themselves
immensely at the barbecue. There was
dancing in the carnival pavilion and on
the platform under the trees.
Four thousand pounds of beef and 3000
loaves of oread were consumed at the bar
becue, and there was just enough to go
around. The crowd was an orderly one.
There were but few disturbances on the
ground and everybody voted the picnic a
delightful one. The committees in charge
were:
Excursion committee: Ban Franciscoâ John
C. Keefe, John T. Broderick, L. T. Fox, M. R

heimer, Morris Marks, Henry Schwat; floor
manager (small pavilion), Gus Wendt of San
Jose.
Eleven foot races were contested during
the afternoon, the prizes being articles of
merchandise presented by local firms.
Many of tbe matches were close and ex
citing and the police had hard work forc
ing the crowd back to make way for the
runners. In two of the ladies' races, fair
contestants lost first clace by untimely
falls, but as the fields were small they
managed to get minor prizes.
Tne racf. that made a ereat hit was be
tween Patrolmen John Young and Johp
J. Kern of tlie San Francisco police force.
This was not on the programme, but prior
to the start tbe officers were informed that
the winner would receive a prize. What
it was the jurtges refused to say. The first
try was a dead heat, but on the second
effort Patrolman Young succeeded in
winning by the width of a club. He then
.received an order for a bottle of chow
cbow.

SAN JOSE, Cal., Sept. 20.â The resi
dence of Mrs. M. L. Ruddick on South
Seventu street in this city was entered by
a tramp to-<iay about noon during the ab- j
â¢ance of the family. He removed a v&n-t .

in and unlatched the lock. The house was
completely ransacked and silverware and
jewelry to the value of $500 were taken.

go into the rear yard, but thought he was
simply getting a meal.

A CALL FOR COIN.
The Republican State Central Com-
mittee to Raise Campaign
Funds.
The following circular has been prepared
for distribution by Major Frank McLaugh
lin, chairman of tbe Republican btate Cen
tral Committee:
Sept 19, 1898.
Dear Sir: It is recognized by the business
msn of the country that the present po.itical
contest Is a most vital one to their interests.
No State in the Union has proportionately
more at stake than California, as her immense
natural wealth is practically undeveloped and
the confidence of outside capital Is positively
essential to that development and to her fu
ture prosperity. The merchants and manu
facturers of this City know full well what
would be the disastrous effect if the electoral
vote of California should be cast against a
sound-money candidate. To prevent this ac
tion organization, concentration of eCort and
unanimity of purpose are necessary.
This committee is in close and cordial touch
with all political organization:- and forces that
favor sound money. Ii is working In harmony
with the National Committee, the Slate Cen
tral cominiueemen, the county committees
and every Republican club In the State. It
haa held more than 250 meetings in the coun
ties outside of San Francisco, which is over
200 more than had been held at the same dale
in 1894, and althougn tbe demands for speak
ers in San Francisco have been excessive it
has never failed to provide them.
The National Committee being unable at tbe
beginning of the campaign to provide litera
ture for distribution this committee printed
and dsitributed at Its own expense over a mil
lion and a quarter of documents on twenty
subjects and in four different languages; it is
now receiving from the East large consign
ments of the most effective documents on ibe
financial issue which it is promptly and syste
matically distributing; in addition to the em
ployment oi the usual meant of distribution
through committees and clubs, which it fully
supplies, it has on its list 2000 precinct dis
tributors who personally attend to the distri
bution in their respective neighborhoods, and
an individual mailing list of 30,000 registered
voters to whom documents are sent every lew
days; it has assisted in the organisation of
over 400 clubs; it has furnished over 125,000
McKiniey campaign buttons, 10,000 posters
and 40,000 lithographs; it provides sixcoi
umns of printed matter every week
to about , 100 Republican and Inae
penaent newspapers in the State, the
material for which is carefully prepared
by trained newspaper writers: its daily corre
spondence is enormous and a fruitful source of
success.
It has arranged for speaking In every city,
town, hamlet, mining and logging camp in
California, and has on its speakers' roll the
name of every Republican in the State who
proposes to take part in the campaign ; it has
procured speakers of National reputation from
the East and is making preparations for their
reception.
All these forces are concentrated on one pur
poseâand one alone â the election of the Na
tional ticket, and as a result of the efforts of
this committee a great change lias taken place
throughout the State which must be obvious
to every intelligent observer. We assert with
out fear of contradiction that the extraor
dinary change of sentiment of the past five
weeks is due to the indefatigable and syste
matic work of this committee and its affiliated -
committees, cluos and organizations through
out the State; this has been done without any
blare of trumpets, as we have carried ou with
out any aiu-mpt at brag and bluster a cam
paign of education, but this unostentatious
method of accomplishing thÂ« desired resuit
haa been taken advantage of by those who
wish to use this committee for selfish ends.
However, many prominent citizens who had
been impos-d upon by the lalse representations
of our detractors have, upon personal inquiry
at these headquarters and from the various
county committees in the State, within the
past few days satisfied themselves that the
work accomplished by tins committee is lim
ply astounding The statement that the per
sonal ambition of any one has been favored by
this committee is absolutely false and does
great injustice to the working members who
are devoting their whole time and energies,
irom a patriotic standpoint alone, to the suc
cess of the party and its principles. For a con
firmation ot ttiis assertion we refer to the can
didates ihemselves.
The work of ibis committee is far in excess
of any previous campaigns, and will require
liberal support if carried out successfully. Our
snergies have been so earnestly devoted to
registration, organization, education and in
satisfying the pressing demands of the people
ior literature and for speeches that we have
been forced to neglect the important matter
of canvassing for financial supDort; however
now that we feel that the work is properly laid
out, and the political forces of the pany are
everywhere vigorously engaged in systematic
labor, we take up the matter of funds. About
eeven weeks of active campaigning yet re
main; our expenses are heavy and will con
tinue to Increase until the day'of election.
We therefore appeal to you for financial sup
port to continue the good work so well begun.
A representative of this committee, se ected
irom the business men of this City, will en
deavor io call upon you for a subscription to
the campaign fund oi this committee, and we
hope that you will be ready with your contri
bution, in order that those who assist us may
be deiayed as little as possible; but a personal
visit to you should not be necessary.
The demands upon tne committee are so
great and the results of the work to be done so
important to you that voluntary subscriptions
should immediately follow the perusal of this
letter. We are conducting this campaign upon
business principles, paying our b.lls as they
become due, and do not propose to go into
debt, and, therefore, unless sufficient financial
assistance is given us we will be compelled to
curtail our work, disastrous as such a course
would be.
You are earnestly and cordially requested to
call at these headquarters to confirm all our
â 'atements, and to ascertain what work we
hbve done in the past and what cur plans are
for the future.
Our bo ks of account are open to investiga
tion. Every dollar received nnd expended
wi.l be exhibited to you. as. under the purity
of election law, we must have a receipt for
every item expended.
If the. plans inaugurated by this committee
a-" carried to an end they will undoubtedly
result in the triumph of our electoral ticket.
1 .erefore, in the inierest of sound money. the
proper. ty of thiÂ« <Hyai d S ate nnd the coun
try at large, we invite i-ivestiPation and urge
assistance. By ord rof the committee
Frank Mclaughlin, Chairman.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 21, lÂ»m>.
CITIZEN SOLDIERS
OF THE STATE.
The Uniform and Equipment Board re
cently appointed by Governor Budd will
meet at tbe California Hotel Ibis evening.
The board consists of Colonel D. B. Fair
banks, Fifth Infantry; Colonel J. J. Nu
uan, Sixth Infantry, and Colonel John C.
Currier, division adjutant-general. Some
interesting data obtained by Colonel
Currier when be was serving as inspector
will be submitted to the board. It is pre
sumed that the board will make thorough
inquiry as to the requirements of tbe
National Guard and the report should en
lighten the Legislature as to the inade
quacy of equipment and clothing in each
regimental organization.
During the Native Sons' celebration at
Stockton some officer of the Guard com
plained that Colonel George B. Sperry had
invited the members of the Governor's
staff to become his guests and then forgot
all about the invitation. The facts in the
case art* that Colonel Sperry's invitation
was never accepted.
When it was extended it was surmised
that the Governor's staff had been invited
by the Stockton committee, but it, was
subsequently ascertained that the com
mittee invited the Governor to be present,
but through some oversight neglected to
include his staff. Later on members of
the staff were invited to Stockton by tbe
adjutant-general und tbe announcement
made then that Colonel Nuoan had pro
vided quarters for them. There was no
lack of Hospitable spirit upon the part of
Colonei Sperry. Had his invitation been
accepted, he says, it would have eiven
him the greatest pleasure to entertain his
guests.
Everything is said to be serene at di
vision headquarters. The idea of tender
ing his resignation which Maior-General
Nathaniel T. James was once sua peeled of
entertaining has vanished. Accord. us to a
ruling ol Attorney-General Fitzgerald of
ficers appointed to serve upon the division
staff will not be compelled to pass an ex
amination as to their qualifications before
a brigade examining board. The relations
existing between Major-General James
and Brigadier-General Wartieid are pleas
ant enough. It does not embarrass either
to meet the other. They not only ex
change salutes, but they shake hands.
The one thing most needed now to com
plete the happiness of the National Guard
is a large appropriation for overcoats and
blankets.
First Brigade.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., Sept. 16 â
The regular monthly inspection of Com
pany X on Monday evening last passed
oB in a very satisfactory manner. Every
rifle was in first-class condition and the
clothing and aide arms were c can and
bright, showing that the men had taken
good care of the equipment furnished
them by the State.
The date for our semi-annual target
practice has been f.xed for September 24,
and every day rinds the men at tbe range,
working faithfully to make a good record
and keep "old" X's average up to ihe
mark. Every guardsman in this part of
the State will heartily indorse the re
marks of Lieutenant Barrere in Jast Mon
day's Call regarding the quality of the
ammunition furnished at tbe last practice
and especially tbe remarKs upon the quali
fication order which has done so much to
discoura c target practice in the puard.
It is hoped that the order will be re
scinded. The following scores were made
at the range on Tuesday last : Corporal
Irving 38, Stevens 38, Paris 38, Aitkins
38. Lyster 43.
The competition for tbe company's
gold medal, now held by Ssrgeant Pearce,
promises to be more keen than ever, and
the man who wears it for the month will
have to beai 43.
Corporal J. D. Matthews has made ap
plication to be reduced to the ranks. He
has always been a careful and efficient
officer and will be missed from the Thurs
day nignt schools and his place in the
squad.
The battle for the lieutenant-colonelcy
eoes merrily on and it is difficult to say
at this time wt<o leads In the race. Major
Dlss is marshaling all his forres, as is
Captain Schreiber, ana the election prom
ises to be hotly contested. The general
fueling among the men seems to be that
any man who will be acceptable to Colonel
Berry will be acceptable to them.
Tne members of the company are work
ing earnestly and faithfully to make their
coming political high jinks a success.
Every man seems willing to do his part
ana the entertainment promises to be a
glorious success, and it is hoped it will re
plenish Ihe treasury to such an extent
that the new athletic apparatus may be
purchased and placed in position in the
a rniory.
Second Brigade.
The First Infantry Regiment has been
ordered to assemble Â£t Shell Mound Park
September 26 at 9 a. m., and report to
Lieutenant Louis Barrere for target prac
tice.
Second Lientenant Thomas J. McCreagh
has been relieved as a member of the Reg
imental Examining Board and Second
Lieutenant Carlton W. Beely detailed in
his stead.
The Special Examining Board has rec
ommended Corporal Chester W. Evans of
the Cadet Company to be First Sereeant.
Cornorals Herbert P. Cowley and Harry
S. Blackman and Jerome M. Coleman are
recommended to be sergeants of ihe Cadet
Company.
A summary court-martial is ordered to
convene at the regimental armory Sep
tember 25. Detail for the court, Major
HughT. Sime.
A meeting of the Board of Officers of tbe
First Infantry, Lieutenant-Colonel Duboce
presiding, was heid at the armory last
Tuesday eveuine. It was deciued to foster
field athletics. Major Simo and the sec
ond lieutenants oi the regiment were au
thorized to devise a scheme of outdoor
exercise.
The First Infantry proposes to select
100 marksmen for trophy competition with
a like number of men belonging to the
Hawaiian National Guard. The losing
team will present the trophy to the win
ners.
Last Wednesday evenine Lieutenant-
Colonel Nerney, Seventh Infantry, was a
guegt at t c armory of the First Infantry.
A review of Major ' Boston's battalion was
given in his honor. Lieutenant-Colonel
Duboce was present.
Colonel William Macdonald of the First
Infantry haa gone to the springs for a few
days.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Bept. 20.â The
members of Company E, Fifth Infantry,
held their regular semi-annual State
shoot for decorations on tne 17th and 18th
inst. Major L. W. Juilliard acted as in
spector, Captain C. E. Haven being also
in attendance. Bergeant R. P. Smith and
Corporal J. R. Mailer distinguished them
selves by winning gold bars, something
never before accomplished by a member of
Company E.
The soore of Corporal Mailer for June
was 45 and for September 45, and that of
Sergeant Smith for June was 46 and for
September 46. This enables these two
young gentlemen to compete at the State
shoot in June next at Sacramento.
Lieutenant Bean, Corporal C. E. Hoen
and Privates J. M. Godman and G. M.
Williams were winn rs of silver bars.
Private Godman made the highest score
during the shoot, having 47 to his credit.
Company E, having been defeated by
Company C of Petaluma at tbe recent
competitive a oot, Ims asked for a return
match, to take place in tbe near future.
Owing to the lateness of the season
neither Company E nor Company 0 will
go into camp thi'a year.
The commis-ions of Sergeant Smith
and Corporals Coulter, Schapp, Kraft and
Kahler arrived here Monday night, and
the happy event was celebrated at the
barracks by an informal musical enter
tainment.
Sergeant Smith when called on for a
speech gave a graphic account of life in
Alaska. Corporal Coulter took advantage
of the occasion to make a public explana
tion of how he happened to miss the
whole target seven times out of ten during
the shoot.
A dramatic entertainment will probably
be given in ihe near future by the mem
bers of the company under the direction
of Lieutenant C. H. Holmes.
Third Brigade.
VISALIA, Cal., Sept. 18.-Now that the
cool and pleasant evenings of oar Indian
Bummer are here, members of Company E
are not begging to be excised from drills.
Last Tuesday evening Captain Ward was
doubly well pleased with the large attend
ance.
Lieutenants Nolan (of Troop I) and Lock
wood (of Troop C), U. 8. A., were in town
on business that evening, and compli
mented the local company on their outdoor
drilling.
Lieutenant Nolan is in receipt of a tele
gram notitying him of a three months'
ieave of absence.
General Henry L. Abbott, a retired of
ficer of the Engineer Corps, U. S. A.,
arrived last evening, with C. S. Sargent
and Dr. Arnold Hague of the Forestry
Commission, for an official visit to our
timber country. John Muir, whose name
is a household word amongst our people,
accompanied the party.
Amongst the many good words spoken
of The Call by others than the citizen
sold.er, the Visaiia Delta says: "The San
Francisco Call prints two columns or
more every Monday mornins giving Na
tional Guard news. The Visaiia corre
spondent keeps Tux Call posted regarding
company news."
MERCED, Cal., Sept. 17.â The semi
annual target practice of Company H,
Sixtn Infantry, has been fixed lor Friday]
September 26. Lieutenant P. H. Medley
of Modesto, inspector of rifle practice of
tbe regiment, will supervise the shoot.
The more interested members are getting
in practice for the event and intend to
make a shi wing at the butts if possible.
Some of the men are discouraged over the
60 per cent ruling. There are otners, how
ever, who believe that the target medals
are too easy to win now and that the
qualification should be raised. They claim
that if neaiiy all can win a decoration the
chief value of it as an honor is lost The
regulation prohibiting the holding of State
shoots on Sunday also works considerable
hardship to some men whose employers
are lacking in patriotism and either re
fuse to let them off long enough to shoot
their score or permit them to go, but in a
surly or be rugging manner. The com
pany's percentage is invariably lowered
by absentees who could and would be on
hand if Sunday could be utilized for the
purpose.
At the last drill meeting seven recruits
were swum in. A number of discharges
have been r commended by the captain in
this month's orders, among them a
sereeant and a corporal whose terms have
expired. Some aspirant* for military
honors are already appearing; their but
tons are unusually bright and their drill
more snappy than ordinarily.
Sergeant T. F. Potter was sworn in for a
second term of three years. "Truey" said
he was going to quit, but when the time
came he could nut leave the boys. Sergeant
Potter is a good soldier and knows how to
obey orders. The boys gave him the "glad
hand" after drill was over. He is an
exceptionally good violin player, and a
little story is going the rounds since the
company's trip to Stockton. Sergeants
Potter and Guthrie in their rambles found
a. vioiin-player and a darky dancer fishing
for nickels. Potter got tbe instrument
and started a rattling tune, and Guthrie
astonished the darky and the crowd with
his steps. The professionals were rele
gated to the rear for tne time being.
MARYSVILLE, Cal., Sept. 15.â Now
that the warm spell is over the marksmen
of thf local military company will make
more frequent visits to tbe butts and some
splendid reports in that line may be looked
for during the fail montha. Just now they
are patiently awaiting the official an-
nouncement of the date for the second
semi-annual State shoot for 1896.
Last Sunday those who ha i returned
home from their summer vacation repaired
to the rifle range and made the following
scores: Private A. Brannan, 45; Captain
G. H. Vos-, 46; Private Barr, 45; Private
Shaffer, 44; Private Peter Arnoldy, 44;
Private H>>vis, 43; Sergeant Delay, 43;
Corporal Selinger, 41; Private Klempp,
41; Private Sutfin, 39: Private Carsten
brock, 39; Corporal Mayer, 38; Private
Rocka feller, 38; Private Fratts, 37; Pri
vate W. F. Lewis, 36; Quartermaster-
Sergeant Morrlssey, 35; Private Hall, 34;
Private Ardinger, 34; Private Bluett, 34;
Private Herzog, 34. At pistol practice
Colonel Furbes of the Second Regiment
male a 43 score.
The company roll keeps steadily'increas
ing. At the last meeting three new mem
bers were elected and two applications
filed. To help along the new material
drills are now held every Monday evening
at the new armory in Turner Hall. Often
the company is taken to the main street
of the city, which has a bitumenized pave
ment, and put throueh the various man
euvering?, special attention being paid at
present to the extended order drill.

Trout for the Blao Lakes.
Alfred V. La Mott of Glen Ellen arrived at
the Grand Hotel last night on his way to the
Biue Lakes of Lake County with 100,000
young TnUoe trout, furnished by the Fists Com
missioners, to add to the thousand* with which
the San Francisco and North Pacific Railroad
Company haÂ» recently stocked the lakes. Last
year Mr. La Mott put in 300 000 small Tahoe
trout for the company, and the average of
these cau?ht this season weigh a pound apiece
and are thirteen inches in length. In addi
tion to these there have been placed in the
lakes this -eason 300,000 young Tahoe trout
and 25,000 German brown trout, which it is
hoped will mingle with the Tahoe variety and
form a hybrid lake irout superior even to the
original Tahoe. The Biue Lake* are a chain of
three lakes three mile* lont? by a half mile
wide, and of great depth,"3sO feet of line hav
ing been let out in some places without finding

enjoys angling but cannot aflbrd many trips
so far from San Francisco as Lake Tahoe.
At thÂ»- Ocean Beach.

than usual at the ocean beach yesterday and a
large crowd in the Sutro Baths to witness tbe
various races in the big tank. The dives from
tbe 68-foot platform by Miss O. SChulte and
M. Milts were as star ling as they were grace
ful, and the comicalities on the platform
trapeze bar by Cornell and Empey created
roars of laughter.

HER PRETTY FACE
BADLY DISFIGURED
Nadine de Ojeda Painfully
Injured by a
"Scorcher."
A FOUR- YEAR-OLD BABT.
She Was Run Down by a Whirl
wind Rider From the
Park.
NOT A WORD OF "WARNING.
Tbe Bury Brute Did Not Stop a
Moment to Pick Up the
Bleeding Child.
Bright-eyed little Nadine de Ojeda, a
tot barely four years of age, is the victim
of a most cruel and brntal mishap, even if
it was only an accident.
During the past two weeks she and her
brother Luis, two years her senior, nave
been sufferers from whooping-couftb. Aa
was their daiJy habit, they started with
their nurse on Saturday morning last for
a walk to Golden Gate Park.
The babies were toddling along, chat
ting, laughing and casting at each other
some few tiowers they had plucked at
home a few momenta before. The nurse
followed them closely until at the corner
of Devi^adero and Fell streets the boy
was taken wiib a coughing spasm. She
lent him her assistance, and when the fit
was nearly over she moved over toward
Nadine, the baby girl, who, as though in
sympathy with her brother, had likewise
began to cough. Before the nurse could
reach her the paroxysm had increased and
she had staggered off the curbstone.
Sub.-equent events are indistinct in the
mind of the nurse. There was a whirl
wind rush, a dull noise and her pretty
charge lay on the asphalt pavement with
a 200- pound rider and his bicycle on top
of her.
The nurse speaks no English, but her
cry of "Mon Dieu, elle est morte!" told in
her mother tongue the terrible impres
sion that had come over her.
She rushed forward and tugged at the
prostrate rider so as to get him from off
the child. He rose slowly and raised his
wh?el.
He glanced at the nurse, who 'ad raised
the unconscious and bleeding baby in her
arms, said not a word, but mounted again
and rode away aa swiftly as he could
pedal.
This rider of most unwheelmanlike pro
clivities did not stop for a second or dis
play the slightest humane feeling, his
every endeavor being to leave the scene of
the accident and the infuriated crowd of
men who had jumped off a passing car in
an effort to intercept him.
Dr. Card, Dr. F. W. Harris and Dr. B.
de Marv'lle were summoned ana the baby
was restored to consciousness.
Her body was covered with bruises, but
it is believed nothing more serious is to
be feared. But from the beautiful face of
the little girl before the accident, and her
present swollen and discolored and torn
face and head, there Is a saddening chance.
The unknown rider, who scorched down
Fell street and turned into Devisadero,
running down and so Â»cv rely injuring
the child, had neither a brake nor a bell to
his wheel.
A Live Repubi can Club.
The Lincoln Republican Club of the
Thirty-first Assembly District held its
regular weekly meetin â  Saturday evening
at Music Hall, 107 Ninth street. About

THISGS THAT CROW.
It is an old familiar saying
that Large oaks from little
acorns grow." This may be
variously applied.
For instance, a man may have
a gonorrhoeal trouble which, in
its inception, is a very simple,
disease. With prompt and
proper treatment it can be easi-
ly cured in a very short time.
But without that kind of treat-
ment it often leads to diseases as
serious and complicated as any
that afflict the human body.
The trouble is that the pa-
tient tries to be his own doctor,
tries to cure himself, or, what is
still worse, he resorts to some
cheap quack remedy.
As a result his gonorrhoea
soon becomes chronic and de-
velops into gleet. A little later
a stricture forms. Then his
urinary organs get out of fix.
After a while inflammation of
the bladder and decay , of the
kidneys set in, and when this
stage is reached a complete
physical collapse is near at
hand.
' Men, beware ! Do not travel
over such a road to early graves.
Go immediately to Doctor Cook,
who is as familiar with diseases
(DOCTOR COOK.)
of this character, in all their
various stages, as you are with
the very daylight.
Doctor Cook is also familiar

SENATOR WHITE BLUE.
Bourbons Unhappy Because Cator
and Baker Are Conducting
lheir Campaign.
CANNOT GET ANY SPEAKERS.
Their Eastern Orators Are for McKin
ley and They See the Tide
Turning Here.
Yesterday was a busy day among the
many factions of local politicians, and a
day of sad reflections to a number of
Democrats who have been hopeful of
sweeping everything west of the original
thirteen colonies for Bryan and free silver.
Senator Stephen M. White, who spoke
at Oakland Saturday night and who con
ferred with a number of Iroquois braves
during his sojourn, is not so hopeful over
the outlook as he was. His aistrust and
forebodings apply not only to the result
in the State, but to the general result for
Bryan as well.
"Senator White tola me he was sur
prised at the absolute lack of the party's
organization up this way," said a promi
nent Democrat last night, "and there are
reasons for believing he does not have
much faith in the way Chairman Jones is
conducting the National campaign."
One of the things thai are greatly worry
ing Democrats is that the State campaign
is out of their hands. Thomas V. Cator,
Populist candidate tor United States Sen
ator, seems to be handling the State
fi-Jit. Democratic headquarers at tbe
California Hotel are aimosi deserted, "and
tbe Democratic politics not being done by
Cator," the kickers say, "is being looked
after by Colonel George Baker of the silver
wing."
However much this arrangement may
please Chairman Alford, the young man
from ViÂ«alia in charge oi th? State fi^ht,
it looks like kindergarten politics to some
of the old warnoises of the Democracy.
Many of these interested themselves at
tiie hotels yesierdav by discussing the
outcome likely to be the reward of the
c.rupaign. As a result they are very
luicewarru in their support and are cha
grined at the young man's frequent ap
peals for coin.
The Democrats are much afraid that the
comine of General Benjamin Butterworth
and ex-Governor Foraker will cause a
stampede to McKinley such as has over
taken the E :st, hut they have appealed in
vain for good speakers from the East.
The one stereotype d answer that comes is
that ali the able- Democratic speakers are
for McKinley or Pa.mer. Goaded to des
peration by their failures, the Democrats
Jt provailed upon Senator White
to follow up General Butterworth with
the hope of repairing, as far as possible,
the damage he will do.
Colonfl H. G. Shaw returned from
Yountville yesterday, where he made a
speech to 700 people Saturday night. "I
have been speaking at many olaces for
week?," he said, "and I rind the McKm
ley sentiment growing everywhere. Me
chanics and workinemen in general are
coming over to us by scores. The more
ilipy study tiie question the clearer do
they see t tie fallacies of tne shyer craze.
Men who were for Brvan a few weeks ago
are now unreservedly for McK.nley and
protection, and we are making gains
every day."
Chairman Streining of the Sonoma
County Centra! Committee came to the
City yesterday. He is delighted over the
outlook in Ms county, of which he said:
"McKinley is the one hope oi our people.
Our convention at Seba&topul a few days
ago wac one of the best we ever nad, and
this campaign is organized and effective
all throueh the county. We have fine
men on the local ticket, and there is every
reasoti to believe that we will sweep the
county. Bryan men are growing scarcer
every day, and a wholesome reaction has
set in."
Charles W. Weston of Los Angeles ar
rived from a trip through the southern
part of the State yesterday, and he has de
cided ideas of the campaign. Speaking of
the outlook, he said: "The so-called!
Silver Republican Ciub down our way is
weakening every day, because men tee the
error they are makng by deserting the
Republican party tor the chimerical
dreams of the Popocrats."
Tiie Junta wing oi the Democracy is
working diligently on the slate, and a re
sult will probably be reached in a few
days in all the assembly districts, bat until
the matter is settled baa blood between
tne two wings of the Bouruons is likely to
continue.

â Greeting /ram the united Italian societies
on the celebration,
The Italian colony of San Francisco cel
ebrated the twenty-sixth anniversary yes
i terday of the entrance of Italy's army into
! Rome. Early in the day crowds began to
1 gather for the festive and patriotic outing.
; They sun ounded Beraaelieri Hall at Stock
ton and Union streets and as soon as the
procession of Italian societies passed they
went to Harbor View Park. Every partic
ipant appeared to enter with enthusiasm
into the spirit of the occasion, and all
joined in making the celebration worthy j
i of the Italian colony and of the day itself. j
First of all there was a street parade, then
patriotic exercises at ' Harbor Vie w Park,
followed by dancing and social pleasures, j
In the evening grand fireworks on Wash- |
ington square were given in the presence i
of thousands, and the celebration was I
brought to a ting close with a grand ball j
which lasted till the small hours of morn- I
ing. Montgomery avenue and the greater
portion of North Beach was decorated in
honor of the day and the Italian flag flew
from many a tall pole in that district.
The procession formed at Stockton and
Union streets and passed along ' Stockton
street to Broadway, thence; to Montgom
ery avenue and on to Union and Powell;
streets, where the parade - dispersed and
proceeded in cars to the park. Qiannetti's
band was in the lead, followed by the
alumni of the Italian school and commit
tees of tne various Ital an societies. : A.
N. Codeglia was grand marshal.
When a large crowd was gathered in the
Park pavilion E. Vena<>lia, president of
the day, opened the literary exercises. A.
D. Splivalo delivered an address in Italian
that was enthusiastically applauded, and
James A. de Voto spoke <in English. S He
referred 10 the event* that led up to t.e
struggle for Italian autonomy and de
scribed the final triumph when Italy's
troops marched into Rome, September 20,
1870. The day, he said, was dear to every
Italian's heart, and no matter where the
Italian flag floated on tuat da 7 the victory
was commemorated. Patriotic music was
furnished by the band between the ad
dresses. '.â ':- j - .-_/â â â  â â â â 'â '. ' -;'? -' .* - : ;.,' . r ; .â

THE HANDBALL COURTS
J. C. Nealon and J. Feeney Play a Great
Game Againat M. J. Kilgullon
and R. Lenlhan.
The handball courts were crowded yes
terday and several exciting games were
witnessed. At the San Francisco court a
game that aroused the keenest interest
was played, the contestants being J. C.
Nealon and J. Feeney against M. J. Kil
gallon and 11. Lenihan, the overhand
swiper. The play was marked by exciting
rallies which created the greatest enthusi
asm. Nealon and Feeney carried off the
honors, chiefly owing to Feeney's all
round clever play. Another interesting
Â» ame was played between the old-timo
rival teams, D. Rodgers and Phil Ryan
and M. McNeil and G. McDonald, the two
former winning the final by two aces.
Several new players again made their
appearance in the Union court, and for
be.inners played a very good game. One
of the most exciting games was that be
tween W. P. Doran and R. Barry and W.
Heffernan and R. Burke, the two former
winning. Some disappointment was felt
that tiie event of the day did. not come off,
owing to the absence from the City of two
of the players. J. Harlow and W. Mc-
Manus were matched to play M. J. Kil
galion and Terry McManus, the heavy
weight champion. It will come off next
Sunday.
Some good games were played in the

DEVOUT GIRLS
AT ST. JOSEPH'S
They Crowd the Church
Densely to Attend
the Mission.
INTEREST IN SERVICES
Redemptorist Fathers Greeted
by Thousands of Sincere
Women.
PAPAL BENEDICTION GIVEN-
Father O'Shea Preaches to Girls on
What Is Necessary for Their
Salvation.
The mission of the Redemptorist
Fathers at St. Joseph's Church, Tenth and
Howard streets, was attended yesterday
by thousands of women and giris. The
greatest posisble interest is taken by
parishioners of St. Joseph's in the work of
the zealous priests, and this was evident
yesterday in the crowds that filled the
church.
Solemn high mass was celebrated at
10:30 a. m. by Father Scanlan, assisted by
Father Collins as deacon, Father Mc-
Donald as subdeacon and Father Doran as
master of ceremonies. Tne Rev. Father
O'Shea delivered a sermon on the seven
dolors of the Blessed Virgin, which formed
the gospel of the day.
At 3 P. m. the mission for married women
was solemnly closed.
The music at this service consisted of
the "Veni Creator" by Cagliero, Rossi's
"Magnificat," Rossini's "0 Salutaris,"
Rosewig's "Tantum Ergo and Qiorza'a
"Laudate Dominum." beautifully ren
dered by the choir â Miss J< nnie Eastman,
soprano; Miss Nellie Gallagher, contralto;
Philip Murphy ana Edward Lotz, tenors,
and Frank P. Scoliins, basso. At the
close the Papal benediction was given by
Father Mullane to about 1500 married
ladies.
The evening services began the mission
or young ladies, who packed the church.
Father O Shea preached on the salvation
of the soul, using the text, "There is one
thing necessary."
He pointed out the necessity of all people
seeking the one thing necessary, which is
not to be found in the acquisition of
wealth, or material or sensual pleasures;
but in the love and service of God and the
observance of his commandments.
A mission began in St. Joseph's Hall at
9 a. m. for all little girls of the parish no
matter what schools tney attend. Every
morning during the week there will be
mass in the hall and instructions at 8
o'clock for the children.
Thursday, at 7:30 p. m., there will be a
special lecture on the dutieÃ which a
young woman owes to her God, to her
parents and to herself. Friday evening
all the young women will be solemnly
conseciate i to the Sacred Heart of Jesus,
and on Saturday evening ail women and
children, who have mude their first com
munion, will be solemnly dedicated to the
Blessed Virgin. Next Sunday the mission
for married men will begin in St. Joseph's
Church.

DOCTORS SOWING
A WHIRLWIND
Contract Lodge Practice
the Question at
Issue.
OPEN WAR DECLARED.
Physicians Who Serve Fraternal
Orders Denounced as
t Ignorant.
LODGE MEMBERS INDIGNANT.
They Declare the Agitation a Futile
Attempt to Turn Civilization
Backward.
Thousands upon thousands of members
of fraternal and benevolent societies are
interested and are likely to be more or
less affected by an agitation that is rapidly
spreading and assuming increased power
among the members of the medical pro
fession of this City and of the State gen
erally.
The matter in issue is tersely and clearly
set forth in the following excerpt from an
editorial which appeared in the September
issue of the Occidental Medical Times:
The question of contract lodge practice by
reputable physicians, whereby medical and
surgical services and medicines are furnished
at a fixed and purely nominal sum to members
of various "benevolent" societies is fast be
coming a burning one. Of late years the mag
nitude and extent of this evil has pressed more
hardly on the profession. At the present time,
with the numerous iree dispensa-ies and ciin
ica and the various "benevolent societies."
some of which even support hospitals, the life
of the general practitioner is yearly becoming
harder.
If we read the signs of the times aright,
there is now under way a widespread move
ment against the various organizations which,
under the cloak of charity or benevolence, or
openly in the spirit of commercialism, are now
flourishing so ratikly.
Some two years ago, in San Francisco, there
were ominous mutterlngs in the profession,
when some new "lodge" was about to be
formed.
The mutterings became louder, until their
volume wa s sufficient to compel some promi
nent members vi the profession to disassociate
themselves from the scheme.
More iecently ( in Soutnern California an
active agitation has been in progress with the
object ot placing this class of business where
it properly belongs â among the ignorant and
disreputable ot our profession.
At several of the recent sessions of the
San Francisco County Medical Society the
matter has been hotly debated and efforts
made to formally pledge all the members
against the practice condemned in the
foregoing article, but thus far without
success. It is probable that this out
spoken expression by a journal that is
looked upon as a representative organ of
the profession will renew the agitation lo
cally and lead to some early and decided
action.
Among the prominent members of the
various fraternal and benevolent organiza
tions the movement is viewed rather with
indignation than apprehension. They
declare it an effort to turn the wheels of
progress and civilization backward. They
declare that the opposition to the medical
aid feature of their organizations is on a
par with the opposition of tiie doctors of
former years to boards of health; with
the reluctance with which Harvey's theory
of the circulation of the blood was re
ceived and the similar attitude assumed
toward Jenner's theory of vaccination
and the germ theory of disease.
Dr. Geo.-ge W. Day wait is a member of
the San Francisco County Medical Society,
and is also prominent in fraternal mat
ters, being grand medical examiner of the
Ancient Order of United Workmen. He
is not at all in sympathy with his breth
ren who dabble in materia medica and
flourish the scalpel.
"A physician." he said, "has as much
right to take charge of a lodge for a stipu
lated sum as has a surgeon to take charge
for a stipulated sum of â¢ railroad corpora
tion's hospital. While it works a hard
ship on tne profession at larue yet It is
undoubtedly a great advantage to the
general community.
"We are beginning to realize that more
can be accomplished by concerted than by
individual action, and this is only one
more in the line of wider co-operation
among the people. The poorest man is
by the latest methods enabled to secure
the same skillful medical services that is
available to the millionaire. Personally
1 am willing; to be injured if humanity at
large is to be benefited thereby.
"A fraternal society has tne same right,
legally and morally, to employ its physi
cian as has the Southern Pacific Railroad
or the German or French nospitals, which
are maintained by benevolent societies,
and the physician who renders service to
the lodge members of fraternal orders
should no more be censured than are the
physicians in these hospitals.''
William H. Barnes, one of the most
prominent Odd Fellows and Workmen on
the Pacific Coast, spoke as follows after
reading the article in the Medical Times:
The writer does not seem to understand that
there may possibly be a spirit of fraternity un
derlying the wltlingnessof a skillful physician
to assist those with whom he is associated in
fraternal ties.
It looks to me as if there was something else
underlying this, and that that something is a
i sort of envy. And perhaps it is justified, in
the fac f thÃt a brother who is a physician and
who sacrincas his time to practically assist
those in sickness and distress must naturally
win the esteem, respect, gratitude and affec
tion of those he serves, and thus become more
popular and prosperous than his less broad
! minded or less fortunate brother practitioner.
Far from condemning the man who is will
ing to give his brains, skill and ability at a
mere nominal cost to help a fellow-man, the
medlcnl profession as such should take pride
in the fact that they have among them men of
such high character and larg-* heart.
If it is ignorant and disreputable to do good
to our fellow-man, to visit the sick and relieve
the distressed, then the sooner the majority of
mankind become ignorant and disreputable
the better it will be for the community, tne
State and the Nation.
BOHEMIANS WIN.
The Alameda Club WaÂ« Badly De-
feated In Yesterday's
bMMt
Painfnlly one-Bided was the cricket
match played yesterday at Alameda be
tween the Bohemian and Alameda clubs,
the game gning to the boys in scarlet and
white by 5 wickets on tbe first inning.
True, the vanquished eleven lacked two of
its best players, but even this mishap need
not have brought about so calamitous a re
sult â so, at least, thouht the spectators.
The toss being won by Captain Ho^u?
tbe Bohemians were sent in. Bowhill and
Sheath led, and the former being in his
best form was not dismissed till be had
put up a half century, when he made his
exit without so much as a prowl. Then
Moriarty, who had joined him some time
previously, completed a scientific inning
of 73, and was followed by Robertson, who
made 37 with his accustomed nonchalance.
The catch by Hood in the deep field,
which dismissed him, was generally nd
mitted 10 be tbe finest ever made on the
ground, for it involved a long sprint ana a
big jump.
When two more wickets had fallen Ro
bertson called the innings and the Alamo
da men went in, with 183 runs against
them. Of this total they tell short by 136.
Teddy Randall, who went in for slogging,
alone reaching double h>ures. It was a
veritable walkover for the Bohemians as
will be seen from the following score:

partial standpoint, as far as either of the
two great parties are concerned. He was
frequently applauded.
Another mass-meeting will be held at
an early date in connection with the
municipal ticket of the Socialist Labor
party, but as yet final arrangements to
that end have not been completed.

The Lyre Francaise Makes the
Day an Occasion lor a
Picnic.
WITH MUSIC AND MIRTH.
Many Thousands of Gauls Brighten
Up the Grounds in Honor of
Their Holiday.
The 104 th anniversary of the proclama
tion of the first Republic of France, in
1792, was celebrated by the local French
coi ny yesterday, at the Presidio Ger
mania Gardens.
The Lyre Francaise, an organization than
which there is no better in this State, is
composed purely of Frenchmen who have
made their home in this city, and who are
blessed with voices and musical knowl
edge befitting them for the operatic stage.
Tne members selected yesterday as the
time for their annual outing.
The usual games were indulged in, and
the fan was fast and furious irom early
morning until late at night, when the
day's pleasure terminated in a social
dance.
As Sylvain Weill, President of the Day,
stated in his address, "We have restricted
the entertainment to only one day, for the
reason that we will have to rest to-morrow
(Monday). You will not ask me at this
time, in the height of your enjoyment,
'Why only one day?' because you all
know that on Tuesday the French colony
I is called upon to be well represented at
the Mechanics' Pavilion, which is to bo
reserved especially as 'French Day. 1 "
Among those honorary members of the
fete yesterday were all the members ot the
Fete Nationale of the 14th of July and the
presidents of all the French societies.
The different committees, the members
of which are entitled to the credit of yes
terday's great success, are:
Organization committeeâ L. Godon. B. Joua
nau, A. Cadenel, J. Poujade and L- Figear.
Reception committeeâ B. Sarthon, 1. Berna

GARRET A. HOBART, or New Jersey
EtKCTION NOTEMBEK 3. 1896.
Worker for the worker? is but another
way of saying work for McKiniey.
Those who attempt to sidetrack the
tariff issue succeed only in sidetracking
themselves.
The Popocrat balloon has begun to
shrink and will soon be in a state of
total collapse.
Bryan can keep on talking, but he can
no longer make the people pay attention
to what he sayÂ«.
The silence of Tillman since the discov
ery of the whisky scandal in South Caro
lina is becoming noticeable.
Fusion consists merely in tbe trading of
office-seekers, and there is no profit in it
for honest Democrats or honest Populists.
Democracy promisee' to make things
cheap, and has succeeded ia making itself
so cheap it is going begging all over the
country.
Whenever there is a depression of prices
there is a depression of labor, and that is
how free trade reached the pockets of the
workingman.
The people need no more straws to show
how the country is gome this year. They
feel the National impulse themselves and
are moving with it.
Almost every producer in America has
lost more or less by the Democratic tariff,
and it is in vain that Bryan tells them the
tariff is not an issue.
Palmer and Buckner are being bitterly
denounced by their old party associates,
but all the same the old feliows kuow they
are right and are going ahead.
When McKiniey said "This is a year of
political contention without bitterness"
he had evidently forgotten the Sewall and
Watson phase of the controversy.
The establishment of a protective tariff
that will revive industry may not be an
issue in the caDvass, but all the same it is
what a majority of the people are goins to
vote for.
The number of Democratic papers that
have bolted the Chicago platform and
ticket is said to have exceeded 200, and
what is meant by that we shall see in
November.
Considering what a reputation Bryan
had as an orator when the campaign
began it is strange how few things he says
which even Democratic organs think it
worth while to repeat.
Free silver may suit th 9 people of Mon
tana and Colorado, but free trade doesn't,
and accordingly the people of those States
Bre not so eager to vote for Bryan as the
Bryanites think they are.
When the workingmen of the country
have eood wages and can consume the
products of our farms there are eood times
for everybody, but there can be no eood
wages without protection.
The best campaigner for MoKinley lias
been McKiniey, and the worst campaigner
for Bryan has been Bryan, and that is
why the people are rapidly becoming
unanimous lor sound money and pro
tection.
The defeat of ' Bryan should be made
emphatic enÂ«ugn to show what the Ameri
can . people think of a candidate for the
Presidency whÂ© tries to stir up strife be
tween labor and capital on any issue
whatever?""
The Republican party is opposed to
monometallism of any kind, whether of
gold or of silver, and that is the reason tbe
business sense of the country supports It
on tbe money question as well as on that
of the tariff.
Early in the canvass Mr. Bryan said,
"I do not think it will require a great deal
of talk in this campaign"; and he has
been talking ever since. What does the
boy orator regard as a great deal in the
way of talk?
The attempt to array the earnest silver
men of the West on the side of Bryanism
has failed. Teller and Dabois are about
the only men of note who have gone over,
f.nd they are taking but little part in the
campaign. The Great West will be counted
in November for protection, sound money,
international bimetallism, good wages,
good government und good times.
Many conservative Democrats who have
joined the .Republican party in this cam
paign wilt stay with it after the campaien
Is over, for as a matter of fact a large
number of business men who have hitherto
acted with Democracy are as much op
posed to free trade as they are to free
silver, and having now broken with their
old party will never go back again.
THE SILENT VOTER.
The fate of parties and of their candi
dates in the approaching election will not
be determined by brawling demagogues
or willing idlers who stand upon street
corners delivering or applauding curb
stone opinions upon tbe issues of the day.
It will be tbe silent voter in every State
whose vote will make and unmake the
President at the close of this campaign.
Who is the silent voter? He is the man
who is employed in this or that honest in
dustry. He is the man who has or hopes
to have a home and a family and
knows tbat continued employment at
good living wages is his only means
of obtaining the one and of supporting
the other. He is the man who realizes
that only out of individual and National
thrift can prosperity come to any person
or people. He is the man who reasons
without illusions about mattsrs of daily
experience within the circle of bis horizon
and voles as he thinks his own best inter
ests and those of his neighbors require.
How will the silent voter cast his ballot
in California? Go and ask the iron-workers
of San Francisco. Go and inquire of tbe
prune-grovrers of the Santa Clara Valley.
Go and seek for an answer among the
beet producers of the Fajaro and Salinas
valleys. Go and discuss the subject with
the skilled employes of the sugar factories
and refineries in the various counties of
the State. Go wherever labor and capital
are steadily and harmoniously employed
in those productive industries which are
doing the most to increase the wealth and
prosperity of the people oi California and
ask the honest, industrious, thrifty, silent
voter for which candidate his ballot will be
cast in the coming election. In almost
every case the answer will come back â
=For McKiniey, the advance agent of
Protection and Prosperity."
Me Jiave lost steadily in both directions;
ovr foreign trade has been diminished and
our domesti c trade has suffered incalculable
loss. Does this not suggest the cause of our
present depression and indicate its remedy f
Confidence in home enterprises has almost
wholly disappeared. Our shops are closed,
or running vn half time at reduced wages and
small profit if not actual los.s. Our men are
idle, and while they are idle vien abroad are
occupied in supplying us with goods. â ilc-
Kinley.
WHY THEY GO TO CANTON
Ten thousand voters, including 5000
railway operatives, called upon Major Mc-
Kiniey last Saturday. But thousands go
to Canton every day and it has become an
old story ; nevertheless, other thousands
will go and keep going until the time
comes to ratify at the ballot-box all these
expressions of desire for the maintenance
of the integrity and honor of the Nation.
In referring to the coining of delegations
from every point of tbe compass and rep
resenting every line of industry, merchan
dise and labor, Major McKiniey said :
"Such a demonstration would not be pos
sible if the people of the country were not
profoundly sensible of tbe dangerous
menace which is presented ia the Na
tional contest of this year."
Major McKiniey understands perfectly
the underlying cause of all these pilgrim
ages to his home. It is because he has
been chosen to lead the people against tha
"dangerous menace" of which he speaks,
and because the people are profoundly
sensible of the importance of maintaining
the Government upon the old true and
tried lines they show forth their deter
mination to stand for law and order in
public demonstration. There is no doubt
at all that a dangerous menace is pre
sented in the effort of Bryanism to re
establish the Government in harmony
with the theories of the Alteelds. the Tiil
mans and the Waites, but the American
people should remember that no menace
is dangerous except when they fail to do
their duty.
It would be difficult for Californians to
join the throngs at Canton, for the dis
tance is too great to make journeying
there at ail convenient, but there are very
many other ways to give assurance that
the people of the coast are in hearty sym
pathy with the purpose of these who do
vi-it Major McKiniey at his home. It
may be said that California is rather more
interested in the overthrow of Bryanism
than many of the other communities.
California is developing industrial and
agricultural interests which only need the
encouragement they have the right to ex
pect from the Government to make them
great, strong and profitable, and we know
positively that Mr. Bryan denies that
tboee interests have any right to demand
or expect that the Government will .stand
between them and destructive attacks
upon them by other countries. Mr. Bryan
does not believe California should grow in
any direction that protection is required
to make such growth sure and profitable.
Burelv, then, California should make such
public demonstration as will satisfy tbe
other sections of the country that she
knows of the dangerous menace of which
Major McKiniey speaks and that sne is
battling against it. With protection as
sured and its auxiliary commercial agen
cies, merchant marine and reciprocity
agreements, in full operation California
would soon stand well to the front among
the States as an industrial and agricul
tural commonwealth.
Our farmers have been hurt by the changes
in our tariff legislation as severely as our la
borers and manufacturers, badly as they hate
suffered. The liepnblican platform wisely
declares in favor of such encouragement to
our sugar interests as uill lend to the produc
tion on American soil of all the sugar which
the American people use. It promises to give
our wool and woolen interests "the viost
ample protection,^ a guaranty that ought to
commend itself to every patriotic citizen. â
McKiniey.
MORE ABSURDITIES.
After loading himself -up with a fresh
stock of monetary absurdities Mr. Taylor,
the Denver orator, returned to San Fran
cisco last Saturday night and distributed
hts new supply. He started in by asking
â¢'Now, what is money?' Then he said,
"It is the stamp of the Government, not
the metal or paper of which it is made.
It is the National power back of it wbich
makes it what it is." In the very next
sentence he contradicted that assertion by
saying: "It is claimed that there is ten
to fifteen millions of told on the Pacific
Coast, and I know that there was an in
tention to obtain and transport this gold
to tbe East, and it would have been done
had not the loss by abrasion been found
too expensive."
What in the name of common-sense has
abrasion to do with a thing that is used as
money only because the Government
stamps it and calls it money? If it is the
stamp of Vho Government, and not the
commercial value of tbe thing stamped
that gives it purchasing power und the
other functions of money, how would any
decrease in the weight of the thing by
abrasion or otherwise cauÂ«e a lots in its
money value? Perhaps Mr. Taylor will
take the trouble to explain why it is that
a paper dollar loses nothing in purchasing
power by having a corner torn off or is
otherwise abraded, but that a gold dollar
loses in purchasing power exactly ia ratio
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 21, 1896.
to the reduction of its weight below 25.8
grainÂ« of standard gold metal. If his the
ory is right, and money is the stamp of
the Government and not the paper or
metal of wtaioa it is made, then he admits
that abraded gold money is legally dis
criminated against, and that paper money
vgiien abraded loses none of its money
value.
It follows, therefore, that if Mr. Taylor
is correct, paper money is far superior to
metal money because it has privileges
which are not accorded to metal, and it
follows, aiso, that paper money, possess
ing superior qualities and advantages, is
never at a parity with gold, for the infe
rior is never the equal of the superior.
If Mr. Taylor will take the trouble to
look up the facts he will tind that the law
makes 2-5.8 grains of standard gold, when
its quality is guaranteed by the stamp of
the Government, a legal tender for debt,
but that it does not make 25.7 grains a
leeal tender, notwithstanding the Govern
ment stamp. He will also find that it is
412iÂ£ grains of standard silver which
makes a silver dollar a legal tender, and
that 412 grains is not a legal tender,
fne stamp of the Government upon
coin does nothing more than guar
antee the fineness of the metal, but this
Mr. Taylor admitted when he said, in
substance at least, the reason why Pacific
Coast holders of gold did not ship it East
was because it would not be as many
dollars when it reached the East as it was
before shipping because of the loss in
weight in transit by abrasion.
If Air. Taylor's logic proves anything, it
proves tbat paper money is far superior to
metal money, because, first, the cost of
shipping it from point to point is less
than metal; and, second, because abra
sion, wear and tear or mutilation does not
decrease its purchasing power. It so hap
pens, however, that paper money the
world over is a mere promise of the party
or nation Issuing it to redeem it with a
metal money of a specified weight and
quality. I! that were not tbe case there
would be no sense in coining either gold
or silver, for the paper money would never
require redemption. Moreover, with Mr.
Taylor's system of money-issuing there
would be no need of Government reve
nues, a bond sinking fund, or appropria
tion acts of Congress for the expenditure
account could be provided for by tho
Public Printer. Mr. Taylor should take
up perpetual motion, now that he has
solved the money question.
I never like to address classes of our citi
zens because 1 think we are all so intertwined,
we all have so viuch comradeship and rela
tionship that the same argument that applies
to one set of men applies likewise to all of us;
and that ha* been my experience. I believe
that in my business, if Igo to it, of practicing
law, ttiere will be more of it for me when
everybody it at work in the United States that
labors with the hands; and I believe, also,
that it is true with regard to every man who
labors in any way that the more his neigh
bors are employed the more he will be em
ployed. â Tom Heed.
THE NEW MOSES.
It is said of Bryan that if he could for
get the Vermont and Maine elections, and
some one would close Tom Watson's
mouth, he would be comparatively happy.
He never reads newspapers that are not sup
porting him, and he supposes the crowds
that gather to hear him speak are not
only themselves enthusiastic supporters
of his candidacy, but that they reflect the
sentiment of the entire country.
It is stated that Bryan himself claims
that at least thirty-eight of the States
will go for him, with no State giving a
majority of less than 25,000. His estimate
is based, however, upon information fur
nished by enthusiastic friends, whose
wish is father to the thought, but he will
listen, it is said, to no suggestion of even
possible defeat. He believes In himself
and has no doubt tbat the American peo
ple look upon him as being as necessary to
them and the Government as rain and
sunshine are to vegetation.
Mr. Bryan was unfortunate the other
day, though, in having himself intro
duced as the "Moses who would lead tho
people into the land of promise." The
crowd shouted "Moses" and the young
man was mightily pleased, but a wicked
and stiff-necked old-line Democrat called
a local paper's attention to the fact that
Moses of old, after leading the Israelites
up and down the wilderness for many
years went off into the mountains and
was never heard of again, leaving his fol
lowers not even in striking distance of the
good things he had promised them; that
in fact Moses did nothing but make prom
ises, and that but for the interposition of
providence every one of the people who
were lollowing him must have starved to
death. This old Democrat is quite agreed
that Bryan should De called "MoseE," for,
he says. Bryan will get the people no
nearer the land of milk nnd honey than
Moses did.
Whatever Moses of old did or did not do
for his people it is very certain that the
old-line Democrats intend to keep this
new Moses out of the land of promise, and
that they are able to do it there is no
doubt whatever. Meanwhile those who
wish to spare Mr. Bryan's feelings will
not speak of tbe Vermont or Maine elec
tions nor mention Tom Watson's name in
his bearing.
We must always remember that unless we
make it possibte for capital to find employ
ment and for labor to earn ample and remu
nerative wages it will be impossible to attain
that degree of prosperity which with a sourul
monetary policy, buttressed by a sound tariff
policy, will be assure d\â Garret A. Jlobart.
SANTA CLARA COUNTY IN LINE.
The Republicans of Santa Clara County
have held their convention, and nomi
nated their legislative, judicial and su
pervisorial tickets. In that county entire
harmony prevails in the party organiza
tion, ana a large majority in lavor of the
Republican ticket is one of the certainties
of the campaign. The nominee for State
Senator from the Thirty-lirst Senatorial
District, which embraces the southern
half of Santa Clara County, is Hon. H. V.
Morehouse, who is one of the best known
men, as one of the most {rifted and popu
lar orators of California. In sending 6uch
able and talented representatives to the
State Legislature, a section honors itself
as well as dignities the office. In an inter
view, which appears elsewhere in our col
umns, Mr. Morehouse aptly describes the
state of public feeiing in Santa Clara
County upon National issues, and there is
no doubt that a similar condition ia to be
found in the other large and populous
interior counties of tbe State. From
every quarter come increasing assur
ances of a sweeping Republican victory
all over California in the November elec
tion.
COAST EXCHANGES.
In opening its ninth volume the Corning
Observer rejoices that its labors in behalf of its
community have borne fruit, and that it has
buried out of sight the last of the Silurians in
its locality. With pardonable pride the editor
says; "We started tha paper in Corning to
boom this land for oranges and other fruits.
Then nothing could be seen around Corning
but wheat fields and stock oi all kinds run
ning around loo?c. To-day can be seen around
the town hundreds of young ana thriving
orchards and vineyards, and the fruit on the
three-year-old trees the best that could be
eaten, for size, flavor and taste."
Nlpomo, San Luis Obispo County, rejoices
over the appearance there of a new paper, the
editor being L. F. Jones and the name of the
publication the Bee. Nipomo is little more
than ten years old, but it has made rapid prog
ress in that period, and its people are just the
kind to show substantial appreciation to the
right kind of a local paper.
The Keswiek Smelter has shut down perma
nently. It was ruu as a monthly magazine.
The publication fell in because the editor and
the business manager fell out The business
manager traveled away with all the books and
accounts of the concern and left the editor
alone to pacify the creditors.
The Pomona Beacon, a Democratic weekly
paper, has come to the wise and laudable
conclusion that patriotism should supersede
politics, and for that reason it is now putting
in telling licks in the good cause of McKiniey
and Hobart.
The Amador Hepublican announces that Jack
son is now assured of a bank and a railroad.
The bank will be established by V. W. Gaskill
in connection with San Francisco and Jackson
capitalists. The railroad from Stockton, which
will connect with a steamer line from San
Francisco, will be completed to Jackson in
about eighteen months.
Franklin H. Austin, at one time Secretary of
State to tbe late King Kalakaua, and who re
cently essayed journalism in Ventura, has
torn himself away from the brain-racking
labors ol the sanctum and will now court the
goddess of fortune from the lecture platform.
A Santa Barbara paper informs us that he will

The California Kaisin-growers' Exchange
has proved of very material benefit to the
vineyardists, who will profit by a doubled
price.
The San Diego Sun thus expands upon the
subject:
"Grape-picking, which began about one week
ago in the El Cajon Valley, is now in full blast,
and at least 400 men and women are em
ployed in this industry in the Cajon Valley
alone. A careful estimate of this year's crop
by those best qualified to judge places ths
amount at about sixty-five carloads or 780
tons. Thin is a trifle larger than last year, al
though the lack of rains last year damaged the
crop considerably. The irrigated vineyards,
however, yielded much better than last year,
and this, with a slightly increased acreage,
accounts for the output.
â¢â¢The price, which is the all-important thing
to the raisin-grower, as it is indeed to most
industries, promises to be much better than it
was last year or in 1894, for which thanks
may be given to the California Raisin-growers'
Exchange, which has thus far been ab'.e to
hold together enough raisin-growers of the
State to represent 75 per cent of the total out
put of about 2000 carloads, estimated for this
year. Last year the price averaged from 1 to
I 1!I 1 ! cents in the sweatbox and was so ruin
ously low that it not only took away all tbe
profit, but came very near bankrupting the
majority oi the growers, who were already
sorely crippled by the depressed prices of the
past three or four years.
"In '!)4 and 'DO desperate and determined at
tempts were made to induce the growers to
combine. Partial combinations were effected
both years, but were invariably broken by
some ol ttie Fresno growers, who, it ap
pears, had borrowed money at high rates
of interest, and becoming scared, or being
pressed by creditors, consented to sell small
quantities of raisins at less than the prico
fixed by the combine. This, of course, knocked
the combine price into a cocked hat and it
wasn't long until California raisins weren't
worth anything in the Eastern markets. This
may have been pleasing to Kas'eiU buyers,
and of course it didn't trouble the money
loaners seriously, but it was tough on the
growers. It resulted, however, in bringing
them to a realization of the situation, and the
combine this year is raid to be as hard and
tough as a pino knot and able to withstand all
the attacks that may be made against it from
the outside. The average price which it is ex
pected will be obtained this year is 3 cents in
the sweatboxes, or about $50,000 for the El
Cajon crop, and la the neighborhood of $100,
-000 for the entire crop of the county."
The Amaaor Jiepublican advertises that it
will be sent to any address in the United States
for one year, giving a premium of four big
Mexican dollars; ou receipt of $4 United States
coin. The offer holds good until November 4,
as after that dale the paper may have to insist
on gold coin.
The Winters Independent endeavors to balance
its favors equally a-> between tbe Republicans
and the Democrats. In an editorial paragraph
in a recent issue the paper opined tuat Bryan

cancel the effect of that utterance and main
tain its reputation for impartiality the Inde
pendent proceeds to throw Bryan down and
walk on him in the very next paragraph,
which infers that the American people are op
posed to the vain pretensions and the mis
representations indulged in by the elocution
ist from Nebraska : "The country must have a
revenue equal to its expenditures, and none
but boy orators deny it."
NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES
There have been many serious blunders
committed in the steam engineering depart
ment of the British navy during the past six
years, and it will take several years and many
thousand* of dollars to rectify these blunders.
It is the boilers especially = that ' have < proved
not alone ineffective, but* actually dangerous,
and quite a number of lives have been lost in
the engine-rooms during the trial trips of new
ships. The Barhome and Blanche class, com
prising about a dozen vessels, nave been un
fortunate in this respect,' and their boilers are
to be taken ; out Â»nd replaced with Thorny
croft water-tube boilers. Another case is that
of the TalDot, not 5 yet out of ..the coo
tractor's hands, â where: the engines had to
be removed after having been erected in the
ship, and after Home alteration* were replaced,
involving an expense of $50,000. in our navy
the steam engineering bureau has been sin

previous experience.

A Consoling Reflection.
Los Angeles Times.
An so the poor but honest silver-mine owners
have contributed an even $1,060,000 to the

eral contribution, and will greatly help out the
party which has heretofore gloried in its pov
erty, and has indeed made it one of the corner
atones of its faith. There is some consolation,
however, ia the reflection that even the mil
lion-dollar contribution of the mine-owners
will not leave the syndicate entirely without
fonde. They will still have in their exchequer
a small matter of $699,000,000, and this will
keep the wolf from the door for some time to

LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
THE DECLINE OF SILVEK
Some of the Causes Which Have Caused thb
Depreciation in the White Metal.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sib:
That the decline of silver is due principally to
natural forces, the following reflections will
show:
Firstâ The cost of production has greatly de
clined. In the absence of an increased de
mand this reduction will ultimately tell.
Freight to and from the mine, machinery,
powder, acids, chemicals, mercury, lumber,
interest on loans, drilling, hoisting, pumping,
amalgamating, concentrating, smelting, power
electric and otnerwise â all are more than 100
per cent cheaper, while machinery and labor
are vastly more productive. This lessened
cost is permanent. Mr. Bryan's declamation
will affect the situation in no wise.
Secondâ The demand for silver as money has
declined.
Before 1849, gold being comparatively
scarce and vicious systems of money existing
in many countries, silver was used in great
commercial countries as a money of large pay
ment, shipment, bank reserves and standard.
But after 1849 an abundance of gold was fur
nished the commercial world by California,
Australia and Siberia. These countries and a
few others produced more goia in twenty-six
yearsâ from 1851 to iÂ»75 â than had been pro
duced in 357 years before. At the same period
the application of steam to railroads, ships,
machinery ana of electricity to telegraph
cabling, with improvements in banking and
me growth and expansion of individual and
national credit ho quickened commerce that
contracts calling for tne payment of sums of
unheard-of magnitude became common, and
the rate of profits and of interest greatly
declined below the old rates.
The new scale of profits and interest could
no longer bear the fluctuations of silver. For
more than 100 years silver bullion had fluctu
ated daily in the open market, and on an aver
age more thau 1 per ceut per year. The large
uoutracis, low protits and interest cOuld no
longer bear the risk as a standard money of
a metal whose daily, weekly or monthly fluc
tuations might wipe out a material part of tne
profit and interest in a few days or weeks, or
during the ordinary trip of a commercial
steamer.
The commercial world, therefore, at once
seized upon the new. abundant gold, whose
value never during short periods, such as the
life of ordinary contracts, changed its value to
any degree which could be commercially
measured, and for a like reason let go their
silver. Gold then became the only money of
large payment, shipment, reserves and stand
ard. Silveriest this market and lost it for
ever.
Such nations, therefore, ejected the silver
which bad hitherto been used for above uses.
But silver fell only slowly, because India ab
sorbed what said nations ejected, and con
tinued so to absorb the cast-out silver till
about 1867. In this year it became uuivers
ally apparent that the uses of the metals had
changed forever. The international confer
ence of 1867 was called. Tbe changes which
had taken place in the practice of the commer
cial world were declared to be natural and
evolutionary â '.he loss of said market to silver
was Been to be permanent and gold was recom
mended to the nations as the only metal
adapted to said uses.
In 1871 Germany accepted this report and
threw her old, surplus sliver coins on the bul
lion market, haaiening thereby the foreseen
and inevitable fall of silver.
The Scandinavian Un'on followed in 1872,
the United States in 1873, the Latin Union in
1876. Silver's day as a money of large
payment, shipment, reserve and standard wan
gone forever. The fall which started in 1859
was steady and downward, downward. The
Bland act and Sherman act were powerless to
stay the forcesâ the old uses count not be re
stored to silver. In the nature of things silver
must continue to fluctuate day by day, as in
the old bimetallic days. It will, therefore,
never for centuries to come serve again for
above n>es.
A second force has made the retirement of
silver for said uses permanent, to wit, the
Check and deposit, currency, complemented
through the clearance-house. This currency
has praciically done away with the use of gold
itseli In large payments, over 90 per cent
thereof being so effected. The action of this
currency has been such as to render the stock
of gold in the world four times more effective
thÂ»n heretoiore. The money-work done has
been the same as if the stock of gold had ac
tually Deen quadrupled. "Silver has, there
fore, never been missed," and gold has been
rendered abundant. It may be clearly per
cuived that silver is displaced forever for above
uses and can never be restored thereto.
Of what avail is the belief of the "boy ora
tor" aeainst such tremendous, evolutionary
lorces?"
Thirdâ The production of silver has been
excessive uf nee 1873. While this element has
not been the controlling one it has operated,
too. A single example will suffice. From 1493
to 18S4, in about 400 years, there was pro
duced of silver (mint valuation) $10,018,681,
-900. Now observe that from 1873 to 1894 the
production was $2,748,396,000. The produc
tion in said twenty-one years, only aoout 5
per cent of said 400 years, reached the tre
mendous total of about 27 per cent of the
whole 400 years' production of the whole
sum produced since America was discovered.
Tiiis should show the most skeptical that sil
ver's production has been excessive. (See the
tables in the report of thÂ« Director oi the
Mint, 1890, pages 248 and 249.)
It is, therefore, submitted to all fair, unpas
sioned, candid mind* that silver has fallen
from natural causes. It can never again be
made a standard money. Its cause would be
batter served if the standard fight would be
given up and silver would be given the right
of way as token money for all moderate pay
ments and, the Government and other paper
money of small denominations in all coun
tries withdrawn in silver's favor. This in
creased demand would tend to keep it at a
reasonable and productive price.

Bank of Englandâ L, 11.. San Jose, Cal. The
Bank of England was projected by William
Paterson, and was incorporated July 27, 1694.
At first the charter of the bank was for eleven
years only, but in consequence of the great
service of the institution to the Government it
has been several times renewed. It is gov
erned by a board of directors consisting of
twenty-four person?, a governor and a deputy
governor. The offices of governor and deputy
governor are given in rotation; the deputy
always succeeds the governor, and usually
the oldest director who has not been In office
becomes deputy governor. The older mem
bers of the boardâ that is, those who have
passed the chair, or, in other words,
who have served as governor â form a
standing committee of indefinite powers
(no precise description has ever been given of
tiiem) and this committee is called the Com
mittee of the Treasury. Some of the directors
retire annually, but by courtesy it is always
the young ones; those who have served as gov
ernor always remain. In the English sense no
banker has a chance of becoming one of the
bank directors. The mass of the directors are
merchants of experience, who have informa
tion as to the present course of trade, and as
to tbe character and wealth of the merchants,
whicli is invaluable to the bank. It is usually
about twenty years from a man's first election
that he arrives at the chair; accordingly bank
directors when first chosen by the board are
comparatively young men. Tbe management
of the entire public debt of Great Britain is in
tie hands of the bank, for which it receives a
compensation, which has from time to time
varied in amount according to circumstances.

Raised.
THE ENGINEER'S ERROR
Adventures of the Bark Willie
Hume in a Fierce China
Typhoon.
IN THE CALM STOBM-CENTER.
So itary Journey of the British Ship
Drumrock â The Vigilan.'s
Load of Rcckcod.
Mrs. Thorold's little tug Ethel and
Marion, which whs sunk at her moorings
alongside of Union-street wharf early Sat
urday morning, was raised that same
evening. Tbe accident was caused by the
engiueer, David Linden, leaving the water
from the dock hydrant to run into the
vessel's tanks while he took a stroll up
town, lie returned and went to bed, for
getting all about the tug, and when she
was full of water she went down in the
bay.
Mrs. Thorold employed Captain White
law to lift her boat up into daylight. The
veteran wrecker, sympathizing with the
unfortunate woman, raised the vessel.only
charging $125, just enough to cover the
actual expenses of sending down a diver to
secure the sunken hull with chains and
hoist her to the surface.
Yesterday tbe hands of the tug were j
busy getting her cleaned out and in shape !
for work again. The hatch covers, sky- j
lights and" in fact everything movable
about tbe deck had floated away and were
lost. As Linden is a single man and has
no one depending upon him for support,
it is the feeling along the front that he
would do a eraceml ana manly act if he
would turn to and pay that $125 bill. He
either permitted the water to run un
checked into the vessel until she went
down, or if some malicious person turned
on the water, as he intimates, he was
criminally negligent in leaving the hose
alid couplings fixed to the hydrant instead
of removing them to the toolhouse, as he
has always done before.
The bark Willie Hume, owned by George
W. Hume of this City, arrived in Tacoma
from China a few days ago having es
caped from a terrible typhoon tbat caught
the vessel in its fierce whirlings. She left
Shanghai Auguit 6 and on the 24th ran
into the storm at latitude 42 north and
longitude 150 east. Several men were in
their bunks ill with the terrible heat, and
tuis made the bark short-handed. The
captain feports that he needed 100 men to
nianape her in that awful gale. For days
she ran before the wind under bare poles,
making nine and ten Knots an hour. The
bark founu the calm center of the storm,
and often for hours she would not feel a
breath of wind. She would roll on the
great billows till it seemed that she would
shatter into a thousand pieces, then she
would get into the inner circle of the gale
and away she would co like a racehorse.
Finally the good bark got away from
the tempest and made her way safely
across the Pacific to her destination.
The schooner ' Aloha arrived yesterday
evening from the Hawaiian Islands. In
latitude 37 north and longitude 146 west
she spoke the British ship Drumrock,
bound from London to Vancouver. The
people aboard the ship had not seen a
vessel for four months ana the Aloha was
a blessed sight to tnem. A boat with
newspapers and fruit was sent to them
from the schooner and the delighted sea
men gave three hearty British cheers for
the Yankee craft and the stars and stripes.
The tug Vigilant returned yesterday
evening from a fishing trip up the coast
and her passengers came asnore fairly
loaded down with strings of big red rock
cods.
The Pacific Mail steamship City of Syd
ney got in iast night from Panama and
anchored in the stream. This morning
she will be boarded by the Quarantine
Officer.and as there is no sickness oq board
she will land at her deck.
An officer of the vessel stated that every
thing was quiet on the Central American
coast and tnat nothing of any importance
occurred on tbe vessel during her passage
up tbe coast.
The following are tbe cabin passengers:
Mrs. M. Alberque, Miss A. Alberque,"Mrs.
Carranza and daughters, Alice Fay and
Hilda Fay, Otto Boeden, Mrs. Boeden,
Joaquin Arzin, Fredrico Soginni, J. P.
Corcoran, G. R. Perry, Isaac Siena. There
are thirty passengers in the steerage.
The bark J. D. Peters arrived iast night
from Port Clarence, Chignik Bay, Alaska,
with 23,000 pounds of whalebone, some
ivory and skins, also 21.515 cases of
salmon, all consigned to Pacific Steam
Whaling Company.

ANOTHER LEPER ARRIVES
The Pesthouse Will Receive a
Recruit in George
Papalou.
The Unfortunate Man Tells a Story
Bristling With Trials and
Hardships.
After being buffeted around for many
years from prison to aimshouse and from
almshouse back to prison, with an occa
sional railroad trip to vary tbo monotony,
George Papalou, a Hwaiian native, has
finally found a lodging-place in this City.
Temporarily he is at the Receiving
Hospital, but to-day he will be sent to the
Pesthouse, for he is a victim of;that dread
disease, leprosy.
Papalou reached San Francisco yester
day afternoon, going direct to the .Receiv
ing Hospital, where he told the attending
surgeon, Dr. Rinne, his trouble, and inci
dentally the story of his life. The history
of Papalou is as interesting and foil of
trials as falls to the average man's lot.
He was born in Honolulu 36 years ago.
His mother was a native woman and his
father an Italian. Wnen 5 years of age he
came to this country, going to Houston,
Texas, where his brother. Joseph Papalou,
then resided. Eleven years later the
dread disease made its first appearance,
but the elder brother concealed the fact
from the public by having the young man
treated in a private institution. There
was no appreciable change in his condi
tion, ana when Joseph Papalou died some
few years ago the real condition of the
younger brother became known.
Without any great amount of formality
the authorities bundled him up, bag and
baggage, placing hioi on a train bound
for Marshall, Tex. There his real trou
bles began. In time he was warned to
leave town, but not heeding it he was one
day summarily shipped to Fort Worth.
Tbe same treatment was meted out to
him there, and also at El Paso, where he
was sent some weeks later. He was
finally forced to leave the latter place,
though tbe citizens were kind enough to
give him a ticket to Los Angeles. The
authorities took him in charge for a time,
but last week concluded, it seems, to get
rid of him. He was given a ticket to this
City, arriving yesterday afternoon at 5
o'clock. The last nickel he had was spent
for a streetcar ride to the hospital.
Papalou, as already stated, will be sent
to the Pesthouse to-day. He will be given
the Goto treatment, and as the disease has
not yet reached its worst stage it is thought
that a permanent care may be effected.
BAPTIZED IN THE BAY.
The Ceremony Witnessed by
Many People at Ihe North
Beach Baths.
Charles Montgomery P ung s a Young
Man Into the Waterâ The Ac
companying Ssrvice-
The ceremony of baptism by immersion
was performed at the Shelter Cove baths
on Bay street yesterday afternoon. It was
attended by a small band of devout men
and women, each of whom carried a Bible
and a hymn book, and participated with
much fervor in the baptismal services.
From the neighboring shores and wharves
several spectators were attracted to the
scene of the religious observance, and
they watched it with more or less interest.
Snortly after 3 p. m. the party that waa
to join in the ceremony appeared at the
baths. A few words of direction were
spoken by Charles Montgomery, the hotel
man, who conducted the service in the
water, and all sang a hymn as they ar
ranged themselves in a circle.
After the hymn a prayer was given, and
then singing was resumed, at the close of
which there was reading from the Scrip
tures. The verses selected were from Bt.
Peter's epistles referring to baptism. The
reader, expounding on the words, de
clared that Christ was baptized on the
cross in blood, but this immersion in the
water was merely a figure of the real bap
tismâregeneration. Meanwhile Mr. Mont
gomery was in a dressing-room changing
his drexs, and H. A. Ironside, the one to
be baptized, was also preparing lor his
plunge.
Montgomery appeared in a long darfc
overcoat and a blue jeans trousers, while
Ironside wore a Salvation Army tunic
without its insignia and tweed panta
loons. They walked into the water to
gether, and when about waist deep Mont
gomery plunged the young man com
pletely under the waves, after which they
returned to their dressing-rooms without
ceremony.
A hymn of praise was sung, after which
the baptized one said he had buried the
corpse that had died six years ago when
he was saved. An appeal was made by
him to those who were not like himselfâ
savedâ and the services concluded with s
prayer.
Nora Coffey's Jump,
Nora Coffey was taken from tbe City and
County Hospital to the City Prison yesterday
to await her trial on the charge of petty lar
ceny. On June 26 Nora stole some blankets
irom a room in the Bnrlington House, and

jumped out of a three-story window. Fortu
nately her dress caught on a wire, which
broke her fall, and she escaped with a broken
ankle and a sprained, leg. tihe has been in the
hospital since, bat has now fully recovered.

others. Young and Hovey were experi
menting with nitro powder in Sharp's
military muskets. Young's first score of

duced a singular result in the count. He
made 49 points, Columbia target, which
was equivalent to 49 points on the Creed
moor and 50, or a possible, on the Blunt
military target.
Captain Siebe, tbe proprietor of tbe
range, has ulso distinguished himself as a
rifle-shot. He had a number of tine fat
hogs in his yard near the iron works, be
low the range, anrl the other day one of
the employees told him that three bull
dogs had killed three of nis porkers. He
seized a repeating rifle and ran to the
yard. Tbe statement was true, and the
three savage animals were standing over
their victims. Captain Siebe set his rifle
to work, and in less than half a minute he
had scored, not three bullseyes, but three
bulldogs. There are six newly made
graves on the sand beach on the bay
shore near the range.
MRS. COOPER'S BIBLE LESSON.
The Teaching of Wholesome Truths
From a Bible Text.
A large number of ladies and gentlemen
attended Mrs. Cooper's Bible class yester
day on the occasion of reassembling in
the auditorium of the First Congrega
tional Church. An interesting discussion
of the lesson filled the hour. Rev. Dr.
Adams visited the c.'ass and was warmly
received.
The les3on was based on Proverb?,
16:22-33. Tne teacher expressed pleasure
at being again in the old-time place. Sue
said: "Solomon had swept tbe whole
circle of social experience when he wrote
tbe Proverb?. It is exceedingly interest
ing to see what a man ot such naturally
fine quality and of such * resolute spirit
has brought back from the wide field o!
experience. There is one study that can
never lose its interest for us. That is the
investigation of human character. We
find much in common with our own ex
perience in the iiie and heart history of
others. Solomon began well, but the
brightness of his life was obscured at last
because he failed to live well. Tbe life of
God in the soul of man ought to be a per
petual development.
"The aged fool represents the very sum
of folly, as says verse twenty-second. But
the gray hairs that represent well-used ex
periences, they are a crown of glory. The
aged disciple, sitting like an old soldier
in the even-tide of life, recounting his
well-fought battles, can tell many a story
of heroic fighting. There is a way that
seemith right unto a man, but the ends
thereof are the ways of death.
"Nothing can save any one but firm,
good habit?, steadfast principles and tbe
grace cf God in confirmation of them.
Step by sten men go downward. In pur
suing evil courses, it is like going down
winding stair?. The upper stairs hide the
lower ones. Each step is a slight descent,
but it is downward. One has only to keep
on and he wiil reach the bottom in tiruo.
Whatever lower? the tone of moral feeling
is danperous. By and by all resisting
power is gone, and when temptation
comes ruin comes with it."
Military scrvico in Spain is compulsory
on all for'eight years, or for four years in
the colonies.

young man of force and culture. Previous
to his charge at lone he was a member of

but preferred the ministry to educational
work.
Rev. G. R. Stanley occupied the pulpit
at the Fifteenth-avenue Church, recently
vacated by Rev. E. M. Hill. Dr. Stanley
was last located at Benicia, but has been
in this conference for a great many years.
He is a comparative stranger in San
rrancisco, not having preached here for a
long time.
Rev. Dr. Phelps of San Luis Obispo
was to have commenced his pastorate at
the California-street Church yesterday,
but was unable to arrive for yesterday's
services. He is expected next Thursday
and will occupy the pulpit Sunday.
Dr. Adams, who has been calledas sup
ply pastor for the First Congregational
Church, it is said wiil probably be the
permanent successor of C. O. Brown.
Dr. Adams is at present pastor of the
Comcton Hill Church of St.Louis, one of
the most fashionable religious organiza
tions in that city. The standing of tue
church is largely due to Dr. Adams' per
sonal efforts, he having assumed the pas
torate when it was a struggling mission.
Dr. Adams preached his first sermon in
this City yesterday morning, when the
church's doors were opened the first time
in months. His address made a very
favorable impression.
Dr. Adams is saia to be not averse to
assuming charge of the church, and those
who know him say he is just the man to
bring the church to its former standing.
A Man Found Unconscious.
Â« An unknown man was picked up in an un
conscious condition on the corner of Post and
Market streets by Officer J. H. Caples last
night. He was removed to the Receiving
Hospital, where it was found that he was suf
fering from a severe contusion of the face
There was also a wound on the head. The
attending surgeon thought a fracture of the
skull might be developed later on. The man
regained consciousness a short time about 10
o clock. He gave his name as Roscoe Perry,
and eaid^that he had received the injuries
while walking across a field at Palo Alto. This
story is believed to be only the vagary of a
mind temporarily impaired.

Lady Speakers
The Good Citizenship meeting at Metro
politan Temple yesterday was a success,
both in attendance and number of
speeches. In addition to the reeular ad
vertised lecture by Rev. W. R. Goodwin
on the subject, "Peter, Politics, Prophecy,"
there were nine other speakers, all promi
nent in A. P. A. circles.
Chairman Quitzow in his opening re
marks took occasion to refer to the vulgar
language used by the speaker last Sunday.
Among other things be said:
"These meetings nave been held for two
and a half years; much has been said from
this platform, and things have been said
which would have been better never to
have been spoken. I, as chairman of
these meetings, 'have done all that lay in
my power to keep all utterances made
from this platform within the lines of
sobriety.
"It matters not to what extreme those
who are opposed to tne principles here
enunciated go, that is no excuse lor our
departure from the lines of decency.
"It is not the object oi these meetings to
arouse the hostility of any one. It is our
purpose to try to educate all to a proper
understanding of their condition and to
extend to them a helping hand to extri
cate them from bondage or slavery.
"It is not our object to force our views on
any, but our hope is that our fellow citi
zens may have the intelligence to see the
force of our reasoning.
"No contest of any kind was ever set
tled by a physical conflict, but after said
conflict, the matter in question bas always
been settled by the contending forces con
ferring toge her or by diplomacy.
"All citizens must* b# protected in the
neht to n free and untrammeled exercise
of conscience and expression of their
views, and only by a free exercise thereof
can sage council be arrived at.
"Let us look more in pity than in
enmity upon those who differ with us and
hope that with increasing intelligence
they may come to our way oi thinking."
Mrs. M. Â£. Richardson, State president
of the Womans' American Protective As
sociation, made a tew general remarks
concerning the recent State convention.
She said the Catholic church was a
greater menace to pure Americanism
than ever slavery had been.
Rev. W. R. Goodwin among other
things said: "One reason I had for being
here this afternoon is that I did not want
to give Peter Yorke an opportunity to say
that I was run off â like for instance,
Brother Uenrv. Now I want to talk a
little about Peter; he was an apostle, you
know. Peter, you know, was unlike the
P<>pe â he was a married man. There are
three Peters known to history â the apostle
Peter, Peter t c Great and Peter the Czar
of San Francisco. 1 believe the latter was
discovered by J. Q. A. Henry. I don't
think ever a man had as many helpers as
he has. He bas a college of priests to go
to, for history, and what they fail to fa'nd
they manufacture.
"There is one thing I don't like aoout
Peter and that is bis temper. He has
called us everything under the sun, and
that reminds me of a remark I heard the
other day. Airieud of mine said that Yorke
was the most reliable man in San Fran
cisco â that is, he would lie to-day and re
lic to-morrow. Now we all know, or
rather the papers say so", tliat Brother
Hudelsoii has not always been what
probably he should have been, but he bas
repented of these sins, and since then has
been a duly credited minister of the Bap
tist church. Now I have an idea that if
Brother HudeJson had made his confes
sions to Father Yorke, he would have
been a very acceptable and altogether
good man."
The speaker then turned his attention to
politics, claiming that it was not the ques
tion of protection or silver that the two
great parties had to combat These were
simply tom-toms intended to distract the
public mind. There was never as much
silver in San Francisco as there is to-day.
"What we need most," he saia, "is to look
after these 3600 saloons in this City and
not the question of silver or protection."
Mr. Goodwin touched but lightly on the
third topic (prophecy) of the subject. He
said that he "might not live to see the
day, but it would surely come, when the
Catholic church would be 'one of us.' "
The other speakers were Miss B. Rum
sey, supreme officer, W. A. P. A.; Mrs
Taylor, San Diego; Mrs. F. M. Smith,
president Council No. 1, W. A. P. A.: Mrs.
A. M. Crosby, president Council No. 11

STABBED IN THE BACK.
Result of a Quarrel Between Albert
Swett and Joseph Bowen.
Albert Swett, a boy 14 years of age, liv
ing with his parents on Broderick street
near Geary, was arrested on Thursday on
Kearny street on. a charge of petty
larceny for stealing a pair of shoes from
H. Paul.
Detec tive Harry Reynolds had a war
rant In his pocket for Swett's arrest on
the charge of assault with a deadly
weapon, but it was not till yesterday that
he was identified in prison as the same
boy and he was accordingly booked on the
more serious charge.
Wednesday Joseph Rowen, 14 years of
ape, who lives with his parents on Lily
avenue near Buchanan, attended the fair
in the Mechanics' Pavilion with other
scholars from the H earst Grammar
School. A quarrel arose among the boys
in the fair and when they left Swett and
some others followed them. Swett and
Rowen had some words and Rowen
slapped Swett's face. Swett retaliated by
stabbing Rowen in the back with a pocket
knife and Rowen has been confined to
bed since.

in Alameda To-Day.
Oakland Office Sax Prascisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Sept. 20 J
Several of the men who are opposed to
to-morrow's convention indorsing Senator
Perkins were actively working to-day cor
rectinc a false story printed in to-day's
Examiner.
According to the publication, Senator
Denison was approached by "a vigilance

Oppose Senator Perkins* Indorsement by the County Convention.
Republican committee," who demanded
of him that he support Senator Perkins.
The report read;:
The fight grew warm in the afternoon, and
a number of gentleman constituted them
selves a sort of impromptu Republics vigi
lance committee. They found state Benator
Eli B. Denison at the polls. Giles H. Gray,
A. L. Fish, W. R. Thomas, Edward Everett,
Frank Smith and a number of others sur
rounded the old Senator and demanded to
know what he meant b>- his recent assertions
that he would not support Perkins.
"Will you support George C. Perkins for
United States Senator?" demanded Frank
Smith,
Denison looked around at tbe gentlemen
who surrounded him, and he said, "I wllL"
"How do you explain your speech before
the Fourth Ward flub a few nights aeo?" de
manded Mr. Everett.
But Senator Denison did not explain it. He
simply got from under the Perkins landslide
and reiterated that he was going to support
Mr. Perkins and that Mr. Leavitt would sup
port Mr. Perkins. Then he left.
"It is easier to explain Mr. Denison's sudden
change of heart at a primary electiou where
he wÂ»s being attacked than it is to explain his
former speecn," said Mr. Everett.
"That statement fs a deliberate lie,"
said Senator Denison this afternoon. "I
paid no such thing and until I vote for a
United States Senator nobody will know
who I am going to support. lam abso
lutely unpledged at this time and shall
continue so, and I would like to see the
men that would stand me up and force me
to retract anything that I have said.
"I have do idea of taking back a single
word that I have uttered regarding Sena
tor Perkins. I repeat that at this time we
need a Senator with a well-defined plan.
Senator Perkins favors a free-s-.lver man
ana freetrade from San Francisco, a
iunding-biil man and a geld man from
Sacramento and an anti-funding-bill man
and gold man from here. If that is Re
publican doctrine it is not my kind. Ev
erything I said at the Fourth Ward Club
meeting I still adhere to.
"1 am on record regarding the funding
bill, and so is my Republicanism on rec
ord, and no man is going to sway me one
way or the other. The policy of Senator
Perkins is not the kind that appeals to
ray best judgment."
Frank M. Leavitt, who will be nomina
ted to-morrow from the Forty-eighth As
sembly Dist.ici, is highly indignant at the
statement that Senator Denison had
pledged him to Perkins.
"I am pledged to nobody," said Mr.
i,eavitt to-day, "and I do not believe that
Senator Denison said any such thing. I
made my fight with an Ã¼bsolutely un
pledged ticket, and no one is authorized
to speak for me.
â¢'f am not any more anti-Parkins than I
am 'anti' anybody else. I am footloose
and refuse to be dictated to. I did not
use any money in my fight, as I had none
for carriages or printing or anything else,
because 1 did not have any, and I am
indebted to nobody."
M. C. Chapman, who was the first man
to say a word against P rkins, said 10-day
that be had not a word to retract. He
said he knew that the story of Senator
Denison having been pulled down was not
true, as Denison is not built way.

OAKLAND, Cal., Sept. 20.â The ordi
nance regulating the sale of milk and the
inspection of cows will in all probability
be vetoed by the Mayor to-morrow. He
says be thinks it is a matter that should
be regulated by statute, and as a Dill cov
ering the matter will probably be intro
duced at the next Lenislature, he does not
think it wise to take hasty action. Mayor
Davie's ideas are partly based on the re
port of somy physicians who are far from
being a unit in their estimates of the value
of the tuberculin test.

RAISED A STORM
Christian Endeavorers Not
an Independent
Body.
SUBJECT TO THE PASTOR
Saturday's Primary Brought
Conflicting Republican Ele
ments Together.
HARMONY FOR THE PARTY.
Decadence of Democracy Shown by
Contrasting Its Last Two County
Conventions.
Oakland Officb San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Sept. 20. j
When the letter of Chief of Polic- Lloyd
to the City Christian Endeavor Union is
brought up for discussion next week the
writer will find that he has raised a point
upon which there are many different and
pronounced opinions. Since its publica
tion it has been referred to by pastors and
at various gatherings in an informal way,
and as a rule the general tenor of Chief
Lloyd's remarks has not been appre
ciated.
In brief, the Chief, who is himself an
Endeavorer, says that the organization
should sing and pray Isss, and do some
practical work. His comparison to sol
diers who wou.'d do everything but win
battles is particularly unrelished.
One of tbe most prominent men in the
city union 6aid this week that the Chief
has a wrong idea and evidently believes
that the Christian Endeavor body is an
independent body. This is not the case,
as the various societies are tributary to
the various churches with which they are
affiliated and must submit their plans for
the approval of the pa>tora. An attempt
to take independent action two years ago
resulted in the liveliest times the Chris
tian Endeavor has experienced in this
city. Under tbe circumstances it is saia
that the proper thing for Chief Lloyd to
have done would have been to send his
recommendations to the various cUurches
and by them submitted to the Endeavur
era. While there are a few who agree
with the views of the Chief there are many
who resent his interference. Mr. Lloyd's
ideas were very clearly expressed in his
letter. He thinks the Christian Endeavor
Union could easiiy found and maintain a
home for waits and little folks who for
\arious reasons find their way to tne City
Prison. The city union is an executive
body composed of delegates from all tbe
societies affiliated with the Oakland
churches and when the letter comes up
there will be a very lively debate.
Never before has a convention in Ala
meda County opened with as much uncer
tainty as the Republican County Conven
tion which will assemble in Alameda to
morrow morning. Broadway was a con
tinuous political gatberin to-day from
noon until past midnight, and when tbe
ghostly hour passed the political managers
withdrew into the various olubrooms and
continued their deliberations. With the
exception of Fred H. Stratton no one is
absolutely certain of a nomination. Tbe
two wings of the parly are more in harmony
now than they have been fur some time. So
many representatives of different elements
united on Stratton that many of tbe old
differences have been healed, and there is
less of a split now than there has been for
two years.
No doubt the common Presidential ban
ner under which all are working has a
great deal to do with the present har
monious feeling. Of course there are still
a few purely local differences, but when
Erail Nusbaumer and George C. Pardee
can come together, even on a Senatorial
candidate, there is not a very bad fissure
in the party.
No one who attended the two conven
tions held yesterday could fail to note that
there was more confusion than fusion.
This was most noticeable among the
Populists, as they have not yet learned
tbe art of politics so completely as tbe
Democrats. In tbe Populist convention
there were two elements, and they talked
and fought from 9 a. m. to 10 p. m. and
broke the time record for a county con
vention.
The Democrats were more politic. Their
leaders are trained politicians, and they
willingly sacrificed tne greater portion of
the county nominations in return for the
Populist support of EnÃlish for Congress.
But they are far from a unit in the mat
ter. The effect of harmony was produced
by the absence of the Daggett ring, and as
there was no one to quarrel with there
was no quarrel. No one was deceived,
however, for tbe iion and the lamb in
politics in this county do not lie down
side by side.
Two years ago the Democratic County
Convention at San Leandro was an event
to be remembered. There was as enor
mous crowd and chaotic enthusiasm and
a keen fight for every office. Yesterday
there were about 100 delegates, nearly as
many proxies, no lobby and a chairman
who had to pause when Bryan's name was
mentioned and wait for some faint-hearted
applause. The ranks of the Democracy have
considerably thinned out since Cleveland
was cheered to the echo two years ago at
San Leandro.' S. W. B.

SKEPTICS DI COMFITED.
Miss Freitag Gives Teata Before the
Spiritualists' Association.
The regular afternoon and evening
meetings of tne California State Spiritual
ists' Association were held at Qolden
Gate Hall yesterday, but failed to attract
large audiences in spite of the moderate
price cf admission. This induced the
chairman, H. C. Wadsworth, to comment
unfavorably last night upon the apathy
displayed by the great mass of the com
munity toward things spiritual.
Miss Freitag, the medium, gave many
remarkable tests at bot h seances, and suc
ceeded in discomfiting more than one skep
tic, to the no small delight of the audi
ence.
An incident somewhat out of the com
mon order marked last night's meeting.
Tbe medium was replying to questions
written upon closed slips of paper, the an
swers presumably being obtained ver
bally or otherwise from attendant spirits
willing to communicate with the writers.
She suddenly announced that one of these
slips contained remarks equally fooiish
and insulting to herself, and requested the
audience to decide as to whether she
Buould read them or not. The audience
having resolved affirmatively, the closed
siip was banded to a gentleman in the
hall who avowed himsell to be a skeptic.
Thereupon the medium read as follows:
This medium is in league with the devil.
The whole thing is a fraud. Tom Thumb.
The skeptic immediately opened the
paper and found it to contain the above
words, exactly as the medium had stated.
The writer, whoever he was, declined to
reveal his identity.
MISS EVA SHOREY, the Singer, Whose Timely Alarm Resulted in
the Capture of Two Desperate Daylight Burglars*
OAKLANDS PLAY POORLY,
Wretched Exhibition of Base
ball Put Up by Church
City Men.
Imperials Were in Winning Form
and Had Twelve Runs to Spare
at the End.
After the fourth inning the Imperials
simply walked away from the Oakiands in
the California League game at the Six
teenth-street grounds yesterday. Up to
that time it was a pitchers' contest, in
which honors were evenly divided between
Kelly ana Russell, but in the latter portion
of the contest the bit; Oaklander let down
lamentably and seemed to lose all control
of the ball. The support he received,
however, was enough to discourage any
twiner. The visitors played wretchedly,
and the nine errors charged to them do
not. begin to cover the multitude of Bins of
which they were guilty. â¢ .
- Kelly pitched a gilt-edged game for tbe
Imperials, allowing his opponents but six
bits. Three of these hits were bunched
in the seventh inning, but sharp field
work prevented tbe scoring of a run.
The Oaklands made their only tally in
the second inning on a triple by Johnson
and a single by Shea. .
The Imperials did not begin to score
until the fourth inning, but from that
time on they worked with a will. Wilds
completed tbe circuit and earned a tally
I in the fourth on his double and Kelly's
single. In the fifth a base on bails, a
single and errors by Arle.t and Fitzpat
rick netted three more. Four runs were
added in the sixth on two bases on balls,
a single, an error by Russell and a wild
pitch. In tbe eighth a double,: three
singles and four errors enabled* the Im
perials to score five more unearned runs.
Following is the ofhcial score:

ARMED BURGLARS
QUICKLY CAUGHT
Robbed Two Houses and
Landed in Jail in Three
Hours.
DETECTED BY A LADY.
Dr. Rodolph Struggled for His
Life With a Man With
Two Guns.
DETECTIVE SHOREY'S FIGHT.
They Each Snbdwd Their Man, but
On y Alter a Desperate Ea
counterâLively Work.
Oakland Office San Francisco call,)
908 Broadway, Sept. 20. \
Miss Eva Shorey, the well-known singer
and daughter oi Detective Shorey, gave
an alarm to-day that resulted in the cap
ture of two desperate daylight burglars.
Early in the afternoon Miss Shorey saw
two men in the grounds of the house of J.
T. Agard at 579 Seventeenth street. She
watched them rin ,â  the hell, and after re
ceiving no answer they went around to the
back of tbe house and were lost to sight
behind the lattice- work. She at once
went to her father and told him of what
she had seen. He went to the rear of the
house and found the two men at work.
They had broken open a window and were
in the house.
As soon as they saw the detective they
attempted to run, but Shorey held them
both. He was attempting to put hand
cuffs on them when one, named Joe Me-
Cullough, broke away.
Dr. C. T. Rodolph bad seen the detec
tive going around the house, and when he
saw McCuilough rush onto tbe lawn
through a window in the basement ha at
once attempted to stop him. A desperate
struggle on the lawn followed. The doc
tor ia a powerful man and so is the bur
glar. They rolled over ana over and Me-
Cuilongh made several attempts to
draw his revolver, while Dr. Kodolpb
directed his efforts toward preventing
him. 8
Seeing her husband engaged in a
struggle for his life Mrs. Rodolph, whose
bouse is quite near to that of Mr. Agard,
blew a police whistle and help quickly
came. Dr. Rodolph, however, had his
man on the ground and was sitting on
him after taking two guns from his
pockets before he received aid.
Meanwhile Detective Shorey was en
gaged in a fight with the other man,
whose name is Charles Hetherstone. T c
detective had a bard struggle, but he
finally managed to eet his man cuffed,
fie then went and ironed the burglar on
whom Dr. Rodolph was sitting on the
lawn.
Just after the two burglars were locked
up F. R. Chad wick, teller of ths Donohoe-
Kellv bank of Ban Francisco, who resides
at 963 Chestnut street, telephoned to the
station that his home had been robbed at
1 o'clock. It was discovered that the
bouse had been lorcibiy enter d.a window
having been broken open by a "jimmy. "
Silver-plate and jewelry were stolen
and all nad been done before the family
returned from church.
An inspection of the basement of the
Agard house showed that the burglars
were the same who had just ransacked the
Chadw.ck house, as ail tne property stolen
from the latter's place was in the base
ment. Mr. Chadwick identified it at once.
Within three hours both burglaries bad
been committed and the men landed in
jail. This is the most desperate daylight
burglary that has been carried out in this
city for several ye*rs.
Both men were armed and a jimmy was
found on each of tnem. Before Shorey
succeeded in subduing Hetaerstone he
ha 1 nearly choked the burglar into insen
sibility. ________________

FRENCH N.Bl MAN HERE.
Count de Beauregard Arrive! In the
Coarse of a Hunting Trip.
Count de Be&uregardâ tall, youthful,
good-looking, unmarried, and in appear
ance not unlike vbe center rush of some
American college football teamâ arrived
at the Palace Hotel yesterday from New
York in tbe course of a rambling hunting
trip that recently took him through the
eastern part of Mexico, Cuba and parts of
Canada.
He will remain here a few days before
returning to Mexico to join a Parisian
friend, who owns a tobacco plantation in
Mexico. Aftei doing some more shooting
t..ere the Count and companion will come
to this City, preparatory to starling on a
tour of the world for sight-seeing, pleasure
and incidentally for hunting and fishing.
The Count says he will visit Japan, China,
India and Effypt and enjoy whatever
shooting thoae countries afford. He does
not like Mexico, the only redeeming fea
ture of which, he declares, are the unpro
saio Sundays, especially in tbe City of
Muxico, with its promenading beauties on
the Alameda of a Sunday forenoon and^its
bull fights of an afternoon. San Francisco,
be says, appears to be all right. The Couat
is more like an American than a foreigner,
even in his speech.
ANOTHER SUCCESS.
LockÂ©'* Special Excursion to Camp
Taylor Yesterday.
Notwithstanding the threatening weath
-1 er the people flocked to Locke's Camp Tay
lor excursion yesterday. There were two
special trains going up, and although all
the people could have been provided for
on one train, Mr. Locke had advertised
that be would accommodate 'the public
with two trainsâ at 8 a. m. and the
other at 10 A. m.â and he fulfilled his
promises to tne letter. The service was
first-class.
The ride was a most enjoyable one. In
fact, it is one of tbe most pleasant short
railroad trips out of the metropolis, and it
is probable Mr. Locke will arrange for
another excursion to Camp Tayior within
a couple of weeks.
His outings have passed the experi
mental siage and have come to be recog
nized by the public as the leading attrac
tions, in tiieir way, offered to people who
enjoy getting out of town, but who object
to the disagreeable features of the old-line
Sunday excursions. Yesterday "everything
went without a hitch, and those who par
ticipated-in tbe trip appreciated the fact
that everything possible was done for
their comfort.
Fire in Chinatown.
An alarm was sounded lrom box 25 at 5:45
o'clock last evening for a fire in Gee Taw Hong
<ft Co.'s general merchandise establishment
936 Dupont street. The blaze, which damaged
the building and stock of goods to the extern
of $1000, waÂ» caused by the explosion ot a

REALTY MARKET REVIEW
An Improved Demand Reported
for Property for Invest
ment
THE TAX KATE UNDECIDED
Another Portion of the Murphy Ranch
Is to Be Offered at Public
Auction.
There is a continued Improvement in the
demand for properties of all kinds, mainly for
investment. Dealers feel encouraged over
this feature of the market, but as noted last
week would-be purchasers are very exacting
in most instances, and their offers In many
cases are so low thai it is quite out of the ques
tion to make sales, except where owners are
compelled to sell.
The Board of Supervisors resumes Its ses
sions to-day, and it is to be hoped that they
will soon settle the tax question so that the
uncertainty on this subject that has prevailed
for so many weeks will be settled. Real estate
brokers seem to be of the opinion that the
rate, both City and County, will not exceed
$1 75, but the record of the present Board of
Supervisors is such that it is not safe to ven
ture any predictions as to what they will de
cide upon regarding the amount or money to
be expended the ensuing year.
KEVIEW OF THE RECORDS.
There were ninety-five transfers recorded
last week, the properties conveyed being
mainly small ones.
The number of mortgages recorded was sev
enty-seven, aggregating $225,723. The larger
ones, together with the security given, were
as follows:
By the German Bank, half for six months
imii half for one year, $12,000 at 8 per cent on
property on the south side of Jackson street,
160:3 east oi Dupont, east 40 by south 79:1;
by the Hibernia Bank, for one year at UJ4 Per
cent, $20,000 on property at the northwest
corner oi Bush and Dupont streets, west 08:9
by north 67:6, and property at the southeast
corner of Dupout and Jackson streets, south
70, east 90, north 70, west 20, south 4S, west
40, north 48, west 30; and by the London and
San Francisco Bank, for two months at 9 per
cent, $26,000 on property ou the southeast
line of Mission street, 7ft southwest of Fir6t,
southeast 80 by southwest 96:3; also property
on the south line of Fifteenth, 125 west of
Sharon, west 50 by south 100.
The releases numbered forty-three, aggre
gating $119,090. The largest one was given
by the German bank to Charles L. Hinkel for
$^5,500 on property on ihe west side of Cas
tro street, 35 feet north of Twenty-first, north
350 by west 125.
There were seventeen building contracts
filed pledging an outlay of $52,126.
MISCELLANEOUS NOTEB.
Thomas R. Edwards has commenced the
election cf some very pretty flats on the north
side of Grove street, between Baker and Lyon.
They will cost $4200.
Silas Cole has been awarded the contract for
the carpenter work on the new Affiliated Col
leges building.
The New York apartment house located on
Laguna street, near Vallejo, has been sold by
K. <Ie Kay and Caroline S. Townsend to John
Henry Miller for $20,000.
The ground floor of the new Spring Valley
Water Company's building, at the corner of
Geary and Stockton streets, has been leased by
the City of Paris and will be occupied by tha"t
house as soon as competed. It will give them
one of the finest dry-goods stores west of Chi
cago. Work on the building is progressing
rapidly and it is expected that the structure
will be finished and occupied within another
year.
Good progress is noted on all the various
business blocks, now in course of construction
at various points about the City. The Hobart
building, on Po-t street, is all up and roofed
over and the contract for tue plastering has
lust been let. It will be occupied January 1
by the tenant, who has leased the entire
structure.
The gas company's new building, on Post
street, between Powell and Mason, is pretty
well up, as well as the American Exchange
building, on S.msome and Halieck streets.
The fronts of both these structures are of
stone and will present a very substantial and
ornamental appearance when completed.
Among other buildings the work upon which
is being rapidly pushed are theCiark building,
at Battery and Bush streets; the Koyul Eagle
Distilleries building, at Powell and Ellis; the
Kosenstirn, at the corner of Hyde and Suiter;
the old Bijou Theater building, on Market,
near Third, and the new Center Market build
ing, on Powell, between O'Farrell and Geary.
The latter will be ready for occupancy by the
new tenants October 1. Work on The Call
building has been retarded on account of a
delay in securing the steel beams and columns
for the lower stories. They have all been
finished now, however, and are being rapidly
put in position. Much of the stone for the
building Is cut and ready to be laid, and as
soon as the steel work is far enough advanced
to allow work on the walls to begiu the struc
ture will go up rapialy.

Tne shareholders of the West Oakland
Mutual Loan Association, now the oldest in
stitution of the kind in California, held their
twenty-first annual meeting Monday evening
at their hall corner of Seventh and Willow
streets, West Oakland. Secretary A. Sbarboro
read his twenty-first^ annual report, which
shows that the association has had a remark
ably â  prosperous career. In twenty-one years
it has assisted 517 inombers to acquire homes
for their families in San Francisco and Ala
meda counties, and in that long period of time
it has never foreclosed a single mortgage. It
has only acquired lately from a delinquent
stockholder a small house and lot on Campbell
street, which cost the association $850, but
the officers expect to sell without sustaining
any loss whatever. The â  amount loaned to
members since the organization of the institu
tion was $578,048 39, and 424 stockholders
have already repaid their loans, aggregating
$447,186 39, there still remaining 93 borrow
ers who owe the association $130,862, which
they are rapidly paying off by monthly install
ments.
The association has also paid out to share
holders who have found " use for their money
in profitable, investments, the sum of $697,
-273 52, including $186,993 77 earnings,
showing â¢ the interest "received by the with
drawal members to have been between 8 and
12 per cent per annum in accordance with the
age of the shares so surrendered. -
The institution continues, even in these hard
times when many banks have stopped making
loans, to help its members to buy or build
homes, the Interest being still kept at 6 per
cent per annum and the premium 50 cents
per share, which makes the monthly payments
by the borrower $12 50 for every $1000 net
cash received by the same.
These monthly installments enable families
of thrift ana frugality to acquire their own
homes for about the same amount that they
should have to pay for like accommodations
in rented houses. '
The stockholders were much pleased at the
report presented, and by unanimous vote re
elected the following officers and directors:
President, A. Merle; vice-president, C. H.
Spaulaing; treasurer. William Wagner; secre
tary, A. Sbarboro; attorney for â : Alameda
County, Land Title Company of Oakland; at
torney for San Francisco, D. Freldenrich, and,
in addition to the first three-named gentle
men, C. S. Martin, August Fick, Joseph Schnei
ly, G. D. Welch, C. A. Malm and G. B. Cevasco
as directors.
The books were then opened for subscription
to 1000 shares of stock of the twentieth series,
and many shares have already been taken:
THE CHRIS TIAN PANACEA.
Love of Christ Makes Men Brave and
Takes the Place of Evil.
Rev. Dr. Spalding, rector of St. John's
Episcopal Church, dwelt yesterday upon
one teaching of the day. He took his text
from Ephesians, iii, 19, "That ye may
know the love of Christ, w*hich passes
knowledge."
The rector spoke of the intellectual
activity of the day, but said no school
merely human might teach the love of
Christ that passes knowledge, nor could
science give the peace of God. He said
God's sun in nature shines on evil and
good; his rain falls on the just and un
just.
"Here is a lesson in the kingdom of
grace," he said, "that men, God's children,
should imitate that their love should go
to all â high, low, rich and poor, to the
fallen and to the outcast. It teaches the
lesson of the brotherhood of man. That
is the brotherhood of nature cemented
and made closer by the grace of baptism
in which we are made members of Christ.
This love of Christ passes knowledge in
that it makes men brave as nothing els*
does."
He closed with an appeal to tbe congre
gation to seek to know this love as the
panacea for present evils.

ORDERS TO RUSH
FIFTH ARTILLERY
Troops Must Leave for
Florida Early in
October.
DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS
Received at the Presidio Yester
day by Wire 'From
Washington.
GENERAL MILES 3 XPECTED.
He Will Thoroughly Test the Battery
of Dynamite Gunsâ The First
Infantry.
Army officers at the Presidio yesterday
were startled by the receipt of orders by
wire from Washington, coming through
department and regimental headquarters,
directing that the Filth Artillery should
make immediate preparations to leave
here as soon after the Ist of October as
practicable. The order states that the
commander of the Department of the
East (General Ruger) will assign the bat
teries of the Fifth to their respective sta
tions in the south.
It is stated in the orders that enlisted
men whose term of enlistment expires
within six months from October 1 shall
remain here, and that others who elect to
stay may remain.
It is also announced that the battery
of Third Artillery now at Fort Monroe will
not change station.
The assignment of the light battery will
not be made by the regimental comman
der, but t>y the department commander
of the E-Â»st. The assignment of the bat
teries of the Third coming here will be
made by the commander of the Depart
ment of California.
The order directs that guns, equipment,
horses ana heavy baggage shall not be
shipped.
Colonel Otis will attend to the assign
ment of the battery in bis department.
There is no longer any doubt of the fact
that the scnenie to shield the First and
Second artiilery'reginients from a tour of
duty in Florida, which should go to them
before it does to the Filth, is being rushed
through before United States Senators can
protest against the injustice.
It is said that the main purpose now is
to consummate the plan before the Secre
tary of War-can realize that the transpor
tation fund is being wasted.
The dispatch secured yesterday is by
command of Major-Ueneral Miles, yet he
ifl Known to be in the West. The order is
countersigned by Samuel Breck, assistant
adjutant-general.
Since the organization of the army it
has been the invariable custom in time of
peace not to send troops from the North
or West into Florida before the latter part
of November or December. The medical
officers of the army fully perceive the dan
gers of sending unseasoned and unac
climated troops there before the frosts
come. What effect the change will have
on troops going from this climate to Flor
ida in '.he autumn remains to be seen.
Only one explanation can be given for
the haste now manifested, and that is the
fear that Senators White and Perkins,
and Congressmen Louo. and Maguire will
ask trie Secretary of War to countermand
or suspend the order for investigation.
The army has been singularly free from
scandal, but it ifl said that this waste of
$50,000 in any other department would ex
cite the suspicion of jobbery with the
railroad companies.
The cost of exchnnzing the First and
Third would be a trifle compared with the
expense of sending the Fifth to Florida
and me Third to California. There is
liaste to get the job consummated before
the press of the country perceives the real
facts .n the case.
Captain A. W. Vogdes, another excel
lent officer, recently came here from Al
catraz with the prospect of a pleasant tour
of duty as post commander at Fort Ma
son. He must go with his regiment to
Florida and take another tour of duty in
the South.
The text of the official order is eagerly
awaited at the Presiaio. There is a glim
mer of hope that some of the garrisons in
the South may be abandoned in order that
nior* artillerymen may be sent to man the
new fortifications in the harbor of New
York. The theory is advanced that the
abandonment of certain posts In the
Soath would induce Southern representa
tives in Congress to vote for ti.e organiza
tion of two more regiments of artillery.
General Miles may be in San Francisco
t is week. It is already foreshadowed by
reports from the East that he will have an
exhaustive test made of the dynamite
battery at the Presinio.
Officers comprising the gunners' board
returned from Fort Canby, arriving at the
Presidio last Friday.

army rifle has been the main feature of
duty at the Presidio. The absence of
smoke at the range strikes the army men
as something peculiar.
Baptain Benjamin K. Roberts, who has
made close observation of the target prac
tice, speaks well of the new rifle.
A general court-martial, composed of
the following officers, convened at the
Presidio last Wednesday :
Major John A. Darling, Fifth Artillery; Cap
tain Benjamin K. Roberts, Fifth Artillery;
Captain Elbridge R. Hills, Fifth Artillery;
CnptaiD John McClellan.Fiftb Artillery; Cap
tain Oliver E. Wood, Fifth Artillery; First
Lieutenant Tiiotnas R. Adams, Quartermas'er
Fiftn Artillery; Second Lieutenant Charles
V. Summerall, Fifth Artillery; Second Lieu
tenant Louis R. Burgess, Fifth Artillery,
judge- advocate.
Pursuant to authority from the major
general commanding the army, compa
nies A, C, D and G, First Infantry, will,
upon their return to Angel Island from
the encampment at Santa Cruz, Cal.. lake
stations as follows: Companies A and G,
An eel Island, Cai. ; companies C and I),
at Beuicia Barracks, Cal.
The First Infautry, under command of
Colonel Evan Miles, broke camp at Santa
Cruz September 17. This encampment
has been one of great benefit to the men
and of satisfaction to the officers in com
mand. The exercises Known to the public
as sham-battles demonstrated the perfec
tion of detail to which these men have
been trained, and that in tiie event of
being called upon for active service they
will uphold the glory of the regiment.
The First Infantry has the proud dis
tinction of being the first organized armed
body of the United States service, its
formation dating from 1786. It has seen
dii-tinguished service in the Mexican War
and the late Civil War, and since that
time has been stationed for the most part
on the northern plains in Indian warfare.
Alternating its presence in Arizona,
Texas and the Dakotas, performing ardu
ous services, it has ever lived up to its
motto, "Semper Primus etj Para' us"
(Always First and Always Ready). Upon
its roll of honor can be seen the names of
such men as Zachary Tavior, Bam Hous
ton, Jeff Davis, Generals Phil Sheridan,
Pike, Albert Sidney Johnson, Mower and
Buchanan. Its present commander, Colonel
Evan Miles, is known to his friends by the
sobriquet of "Paddy Miles." He is a jolly
good lellowâ albeit a strict disciplinarianâ
and has seen excellent service during the
Civil War. Of his staff, Captain Maus has
seen probably as much arduous service in
Indian warfare as any other officer now
living in the West. "He was one of the
principal agents in the capture of
Geronimo in the Sierra Madres in Mexico.
For a long period he was on the staff
of General Miles. Captain O'Connell and
Captain Parker are the oldest officers with

HE SWAM THE
GOLDEN GATE
Extraordinary Feat Yes
terday of a Determined
Swimmer.
CROWDS ON THE SHORE
Over Seven Miles in the Tide
in One Hour and Fiiteen
Minutes.
A VEEY IXCITING FINIBH.
Ths Afternoon in the Biy Closed With
an Exhibition of Lofty
Living.
Man has conefnered the sleeping flood
of waters at the Golden Gate.
Charles Cavill yesterday afternoon swam
from shore to shore, accompanied by a
fleet of saiiboats and many screaming
â¢teamen and tugs. When his feet touched
the sand at Fort Point and he stood up
and bowed to the multitude the occupants
of almost numberless rowboats added
their cheers to the toot of whistles and
the clang of bells. Cavill is said to be the
first and only man who ever accomplished
the feat of swimming from shore to shore
where the bay and ocean meet.
Many persons left the fort before the
swim had terminated. This was owing to
a widespread report that Cavill had de
cided not to attempt the feat on account
of the swift tide and cold waters. Yachts
loaded with spectators also left the scene
without seeing the swim.
Instead of star ting from the Fort Point
side, as advertised, and swimming to
Lime Point, Cavill plunged into the swift
waters on the Lime Point side. He did
not wade out to his armpits and calmly
float on the bosom of the deep. He took
a header from the rocks with the surf
boiling around him and thenceforward
upon coming to the surface he rode on
top of the wave, sipping the foam, a bold
horseman of the deep, as proud as any
Neptune.
Two Whitehall boats accompanied Ca
vill to lend him assistance in case of
emergency. Their services were entirely
supernumerary. He joked and chatted
with the occupants from shore to shore.
The ferry-boat Sausaiito, crowded to the
hurricane deck with people.and a large fleet
of sail and row boats saw the swim and
the nnish. The management of the Sau
salito was very poor. The crowd that had
been out all afternoon were furnished
with only hardtack and tea in the boat's
restaurant, and the waiter., varied the cus
tomary situation on Sunday alternuon.
They promenaded the lower deck while
passengers raced around and helped them
selves to knives and forks and spoons.
Cavill was 1 hour and 15 minutes in
swimming across the gateway ot water-.
The distance straight across is only about
one and a quarter miles, but before his
feet touched bo torn on the opposite shore
Cavill had swam seven mi.es. The tide â
a very strong ebb stream â did it. He
went into the water at 3:30, and at 4:45 he
walked ashore on the other side. Thou
sands of spectators dotting the heights
applauded the finish.
He was taken from tbe shore to the ferry
boat Sausahto in one of the Whitehall boats
and came into the City with the crowd on
the boat. On shore a large crowd rusned
Ito shake him by the hand. The boats
j blew their whistles and the scene for a few
: minutes was one of intense excitement.
| The swim was under the auspices of the
i California Swimming Club.
Direcily after Cavill landed on the Sau
salito an exhibition of lofty diving was
given by Adolpn Kahn, champion high
diver of California, from the hurricane
deck of tbe Sausalito.
Cavill went at once to the stateroom of
Captain Wilson. He was chilled through.
He took a drink of brandy and was thor
oughly rubbed Uown by attendants. In
an interview with a Call reporter he said :
"1 did not know whether I could do this
thing or not, but I thought I could and
determined to try. My father, Frederick
Cavill, was the champion swimmer of the
world. He swam the English Channel,
very choppy water, seventeen years ago
in eleven hours a distance of twenty-one
miles. lam twenty-tive years old. The
water was cold this afternoon, and my
right arm was useless nearly half the way
across. I punched the bag yesterday ait
eruoon and I think I exercised too much.
That was what was the matter. But I ielt
ail right. I had no idea of giving up. 1
can float if I can't swim."
"What stroste did you use?"
"The underhand side stroke. I did not
swim on my back at all, no sir. I swam
all the time, and on my right side. I
took advantage of the back current from
the other shore."
"What is the secret of long distance
I swimming?"
"The secret of long distance swim- |
ming," be said, "is the proper stroke."
Cavill says he gave an exhibition swim
before Queen Victoria when he was 3 years
of age. He recently won the champion
ship of the Pacific Coast for a quarter
miie, and will soon leave for England to
challenge Nattall, the English champion
swimmer of the world. He snys he is
grepared to swim for the world's cham
pionship any distance from a quarter to
five miles. Cavill claims to have won the
championship of Australia before coming
to this coast.
AT THE CHUTES.
Disposing of a Donkey at Ten Cent* d
Chance.
There was a great number of people at
the Haight-street grounds yesterday to
witness Antonio Pirri take his last ride
down ; the chutes and plunge in the lake. â¢
As on previous occasions his act was as
successful as it was startling.
There was a good performance ;In the
Casino, the several numbers being re
ceived', with marks of approbation. The
fun of the : afternoon was the' raffle of a
donkey. There arÂ« eight of the animals on
the grounds for the use of children, but the
younger members of the community did
not take kiudly to the burros. Manager
Bert de Tamble tried to give the animals
away, but found no takers, so he con- j
eluded to dispose of them by chance, one
by oÂ»e. on successive Sundays at 10 cents
a chance. â¢ The first one : put up did not
fetch a very large amount of money, but
his sale created a great deal of merriment.
The winner was a man named Seacolm,
who when handed his prize was as happy
as a child with a new. toy, but in > a short
time he realized that being a bachelor,
with only tÂ» room to call his home, he had
noplace to keep the animal. In despair
he asked those around what he should do
with bis long-eared prize and no one vol
unteered a suggestion, but the burro

haw. At dusk S acolm was holding the
halier that was fastened around the prize
and wondering what he would do with it.

AGREED TO KEEP
HIM FOR LIFE
Terms Given a Veteran for
His Oregon Gold
Mine.
A WIDOWS BAD BARGAIN
John Patten Says He Was
Lccked Up and Threatened
in Her Basement.
STILL HAS THE AGREEMENT.
Mrs. A. F. Steels, a Woman of
Wealth, D Clares the ex-Sol*
dier Is a Schemer.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Sept. 20. j
Mrs. A. F. Bteele, a wealthy widow of
Durant street, deeply reereta the day only
a month ago when she listened to an old
soldier's story of a gold mine in Oregon.
She regrets even more that she was led by
his persuasiveness to invest in it and to
guarantee old John Patten a home for life
for his share in the mine.
This was a month ago. Now John Pat
ten has engaged an attorney to fight his
claim against the widow for imprisoning
him in the basement of her handsome
residence for several hours while she at
tempted by means of threats to make him
yield up the agreement she now regrets
signing. He has reported his case to the
police and they are doing some very quiet
work on it.
Mrs. Steele is well known in Oakland
society, lives in the fashionable quarter,
maintains an elegant house and is the
owner, besides other property, of a very
lucrative ranch at San Luis ObisDO. The
ranch was started by her late husband
many years ago, and after his, death the
widow came to Oakland for the purpose of
educating her son.
John Patten is a veteran soldier who
mends china and does some peddling for a
living. He is a well-known character Ã¼bnut
town, and has frequently referred to his
experience as a p o-pector, but nobody
ever remembers him as a t:ord miner.
About a month ago a rery loquacious
old pedd.er called ai the Su-ele residence
at 310 Durant street. He asked if the lady
of the house had any old chinaware that
wanted repairing. Mrs. Steele bad some,
and the old soldier's manner was so pleas
ant without being free that his plea of
being hungry was also attended to.
While eating, the peddler, who was old
John Patten, entertained Mrs. Steele and
her visitor, Mrs. John G. Lemmon, who is
the wife of the State botanist. He told of
his experience in war time and finally
drifted into tbe story of his gold mine.
He owned a mine, he said, at Grants
Pass, Or., that was a very paying bole in
the grouna, but he had been unable *o
work it for want ot capital. He men
tioned incidentally that if he could take
just enough out of it to live on that any
one who would help him start up the mine
i could have the rest
Just what arguments the old veteran
used are of no great importance, but a
few days later he was in possession of
an agreement duly signed by Mrs. Steele,
guaranteeing to -cc thathedid n twantfor
anything for the rest of his life in con
sideration of giving to Mrs. Steele his in
terest in the Oregon mine. Mrs. Steele
had a young friend in San Francisco named
William Brainard, and a tew days after the
old peddler made bis first call at tbe
Steele residence he and Brainard were
fitted ont with good clothes, a complete
placer mining outfit and cash, and started
for Grants Pass to bring back some sam
ples of the ore for assay purposes. About
two weeks ago Patten returned to Mrs.
Steele with some camples ot his ore, and
they were duly assayed and found to be
practically worthless.
When the facts were made known to
Mrs. Steele she refused to have anything
more to do with Patten's mine and re
quested tbe return of the agreement to
help Patten for life. Patten handed it to
his attorney, George C. Reed, and if pos
sible will try and make Mrs. Steele fulfill
its terms.
"After I told her about the mine," said
Patten yesterday, "she was quite anxious
to get an interest in it. She saw a possi
bility of making a good stake and jumped
at it. I told her that I would look after
'the mine and she could have the total out
put if she would guarantee me enough to
live on for the rest of my life.
"I went to Oregon and brought back
samples, and if they were not rich it was
not my fault. She took her chance and I

did my best. About a week ago I called
at the bouse and she invited me into a
room in the basement. She then locked
me in and kept me there several hours. I
was told if I would give up that agreement
I would be liberate;;. I refused to do so
and was frightened almost to death. I did
not know but what I should be kept there
till I starved to death.
"I offered to compromise the whole
matter for $200 but she refused, and I de
cided not to part with that argreement
unless I were convinced that it might
mean life or death to me. Ever since I
came back she has tried to ignore me, but
I will not permit it. I will attend to that
mine for her and she will stand by her
agreement or I will know why. The
agreement I have given to Attorney Reed
to keep, and I think 1 shall >hortly bring
suit to compel Mrs. Steele to support me."
Patten is rooming at present at the
house of Mrs. Wetherbee at Fruitvale.
Mrs. Steele told a story to-day that dif
fers widely from that told by Patten.
â¢'The incidents related bj* Patten as to
the manner of our becoming first ac
quainted are substantially true," said Mrs.
Steele this afternoon. "What he says
about my anxiety to purchase a share in
his gold mine is entirely false. He told
me about his mine and of its richness, and
came day after day to me, until I was
fopilsh enough to agree to help him, in
consideration of an interest in the mine,
which, he assured me, was remarkably rich.
1 fitted him out and gave him a helper,
anil am now out several hundred dollars,
and think I have done enough for him.
"1 have tried to induce him to give mÂ« i
back the agreement, but be refuses. I j
deny any such trick as decoying him into
the basement and locking him up till he
feared I intended .otake his life. All this
business is a scheme, and I am convinced
that his mine i- nothing but a mudhole in
the around and is worthless. I gave him
|S yesterday, but shall not g ye him an- j
other cent. I have been victimized enough ,
and will henceforth ignore Patten's de
mands for money."
MEPHISTO N A WHEEL
Misfortunes of Mr. Davis, Who Thought
He Had a "Pull. "
Last Saturday Bert de Tamble, manager
of the Haight-street grounds, hit upon a
new scheme of advertising the last ap
pearance of Antonio Pirri, the demon
cycler, at the ci.utes. He hired a man
named Laurens, dressed him up in a suit
of red, after the most approved manner of
the stage Mephisto, and set him on a
wheel to ride about town with a placard
on his doublet.
The start was made all right, but before
Laurens reached the bu*y part of the City
he fell, sprain d his ankle and was unable
to ptoceed. He was tak> n to a cyclers*,
where a man named Davis, who declared
he was out of a job, volunteered to take
his place. Davis, as a red demon, created
a sensation. Before he had ridden many
blocks he had succeeded in frightening a
number of horses, and when tarnins into
Sixth street he was taken to the Southern
station, where he was charged with misde
meanor.
After a time Davis was released on his
own recognizance, but he was very angry
that he should have been kept in prison
lor several hours. "I thought I had h
pull, said he, "and the boys at the club
told me so, but I found it wouldn't work
without an immense amount of chinning
I guess what I lacked was the push."
Davis will be tried in the Police Court to
day.
The total strength of a German cavalry
regiment is 25 officers, 667 men and 792
horses, 62 of which are officers' chargers.
